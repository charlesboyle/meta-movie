why don't you all just
shut the fuck up and let's go?
hold up, you guys.
hold up.
what the fuck is that?
bullet.
we just wasted
our whole fucking career
for this shit and
there's nothing here?
this ain't good.
let's walk.
check the water.
we sold ourselves out for this.
we got a little problem.
$10 million is missing.
now listen. you all
did a fine job in there.
we're not arguing that you've
got a good record with the dea.
none of that matters right now,
'cause all we need to do is find
out where that $10 million is.
and that's why you're here.
it was a big, giant
fucking stack of money.
how do you know, exactly down to the
dollar, how much was in that room?
well, the fbi was
carrying on
a parallel investigation.
did you ever see
the $200 million?
did you guys hear me
say i want my lawyer?
you know what would clear your ass?
if you'd take a polygraph.
no poly-
no poly?
that's weak.
that's sad.
your ass is going to prison.
when money is supposed to
be there and it goes away,
and it looks like to us,
it was a setup.
it may not be, and we're
going to find out.
and i know you had
a friend who died.
and that's awful, and it's
going to be more awful
if it was because of money.
my friend did not die
for fucking $10 million.
we lost a man,
we lost a brother.
and you don't give
a shit about that.
it was wharton's
idea, wasn't it?
you were just following the
lead of a respected supervisor.
i mean, john is like your daddy.
you were doing
what you had to do.
fuck you.
you don't know my daddy.
this agency saved your ass.
you were going nowhere.
you were a question
mark coming in here.
and you have been better
than any of us ever dreamed.
and you've always outperformed.
we're trying to
save that career.
this is your family, joe.
this is your family.
see, i'm not a thief.
if that cartel finds out that
you took $10 million,
they're going to slit your
throat from ear to ear.
i gotta pee, man.
say what?
i gotta piss.
then go pee.
man, he got cameras all over.
there's no way i can go.
oh, dude, really?
piss, man. what the hell?
what you think?
i'm not going to stick my dick
where your dick been sticking in, man.
i ain't putting it in there.
yeah, the problem is, your
shit probably fit in there.
my shit don't fit in there. i need a
thermos or some shit. look at this.
you threw a bottle
of piss in my lap.
man, it's got a cap on it.
morning, breach.
morning.
hey, good morning.
oh, man, thanks, breach!
breakfast of champions, huh?
here's your dvd, man.
appreciate it.
and don't piss in
my bushes anymore, okay?
i have a surveillance camera.
i see it all.
no, that was him.
i've got a bottle.
i'm not using that bottle.
i ain't sticking my dick nowhere
your dick has been, damn that.
you didn't say
that about rebecca.
when you fuck rebecca?
i fuck them all.
bro.
just follow that truck.
i'm gonna deal with you.
so you think he did it?
i don't know if he did it. i just
know i hear stuff, that's all i'm saying.
they're looking for something.
but they haven't found anything,
or else we wouldn't be following
him around like this.
yeah.
why don't you just
pull the pin on this?
you're never going to be able to
spend that blood money anyway.
do it for your team.
do it for your country.
do it for yourself.
retire. end it.
end the pain.
fuck you, breacher.
i hate it as much
as you do, sir.
tactical god.
why don't you wash
your fucking hands?
that's a new suit?
why do you rock that off-the-rack,
cheap-ass jcpenney shit
when you can afford armani?
in fact, why aren't you
on a yacht in the caymans?
i know what you're trying to do.
the jabs, the jokes.
but tell them
i'm not going to bite.
what's! you tell
smoke jennings' wife?
that he died for a good
cause, making you rich?
tell them you let me disarm you.
give me the fucking gun.
come in.
have a seat, john.
it's over.
i'll go and clean out my desk.
i'm not firing you.
the investigation is over.
no ones been exonerated.
dc just lost their appetite.
who do you know
in washington, john?
got a picture of a senator
fucking a goat, maybe?
the only thing anyone in law
enforcement has is their credibility.
li's like virginity. once
it's gone, it's gone forever.
when did you lose yours?
what if i gave you
your team back?
don't fuck with me.
no one wants you, john.
i've got nowhere
else to stick you.
mind showing some
leadership this time?
gun.
badge.
grads.
there you go.
you're back in the game.
they don't fucking let us train.
they don't let us shoot.
i mean, i can't even carry a
fucking gun in here, dude.
we're sitting on
our asses, rotting.
it's punishment, bro.
don't let it get in your head.
just deal with it. lam.
who's winning?

get the fuck out of the way!
- in the middle of my goddamn game!
- fuck me!

i feel like a fucking parolee.

on your back, pyro?
you know what, bro, this is a
fallen soldier. fuck you, man.
will you fucking dial it down?
i just lost a buddy down range!
easy, easy,
killer. hell!

of look like a dick.
the expert has spoken.

in the mirror, you're dead.
it doesn't look like a dick.
get off my ass, man!
you might wanna listen to this.

'cause all the company she
keeps is rubbing off on her.

piece-of-shit-ness...

and sweep the rv's cab.
for what?
what am i looking for?
linkage.
they're dead and we're not.
what are we doing?
we d-up and
present a hard target.
like taking showers
with full body armor.
well, we need fucking intel.
who'd they send up? well, who
do you think, sweetheart?
check the board!
could be soto!
could be fucking romero!
it could be fucking...
they could be...
they may be... fucking...
any of this a surprise to you?
just let it go, huh?
surprise to you, sugar?
i don't really know
what you're talking about.
guess i'm the only one
with any fucking balls here.
it's the goddamn money.
just let it
go, all right? no!
we had to go fingering
the devil's pussy.
it's an occupational hazard
when you fight the cartels.
oh, really?
you see any other
feds getting smoked?
it could happen to anyone.
bullshit!
you believe that, chief?
or is that just some shit you're
spitting in case this place is bugged?
always assume that
someone is listening.
so shut the fuck up.
i ain't gonna fight you, boss.
where the fuck are you going?
out.
i'm bored.
you're not going out.
it's not safe.
they're hunting us.
i can take care of myself.
give me that fucking... no!
give that back to me. give
that back to me! monster!
what's this, huh?
is this chewing gum?
huh?
yeah.
what the fuck you need this for?
what the fuck do
you need this for?
get out of my way.
no, lizzy.
it's the stripper.
can we talk inside?
what the fuck do you want?
just some background
information on your unit.
so i can develop some suspects.
you know what we do, right?
this special operations team?
well, to be honest,
i have no idea.
why don't you tell me?
we covertly
penetrate
drug organizations.
i guess that would make
you some enemies, huh?
any one come to mind?
any particular guy
that might nail special agent
jordan to a ceiling?
are you really this stupid?
ma'am, i'm not your friend,
and i'm not your colleague.
so don't bully me.
or i'll slap you
with a 48-hour jail hold.
and by the looks of things,
you can't hack a day without your
favorite controlled substance.
so let's keep it nice, shall we?
and yes' assume i'm stupid.
paint me a picture.
please.
i took these in juarez.
they're friends of mine.
and this is what
the rios-garza cartel does
to indicate that
you've pissed them off.
sweetheart, you're so in
over your fucking head.
you need more than a glock
and sensible shoes.
walk away.
walk away.
i'll show myself out.
thank you for your time.
it's our pleasure.
we're gonna
have to each get two jobs
just to put him through school.
have you
considered prostitution?
hey, what's up?
more black hairs.
and look.
a beautiful thumbprint we got off
the steering column of the rv.
it's not the vic's.
boo-yeah! linkage.
you just said
"boo-yeah."
that's my thing.
don't jack my thing.
i heard the lab tech say it.
i didn't hear it.
bullshit, you heard it.
well, if she said it,
she got it from me.
due to the staging of special
agent jordan's body,
we believe there's a connection
to the rios-garza cartel.
dto. rios-garza drug
trafficking organization.
we don't use
the term "cartel."
thank you, sir.
it seems that special agent
roberts' death
was not an accident.
we have recovered physical evidence
linking the two crime scenes.
i would like to have
a copy of those files,
if you could make
those available for me.
yes' sir. today, would
that be all right?
yes, sir.
thank you.
investigator brentwood, what
exactly do you want from us?
well, learning about the victims
helps me find the suspects.
maybe these murders are blowback
from cases they worked on.
you want access
to dea case files?
it would help.
are you asking for investigatory
support or access to our records?
both.
look' maybe there's someone
i can liaise with,
someone who...
investigator brentwood,
your agency needs to draft a formal
letter requesting assistance.
any documents you want access to
will need to be specifically cited.
specifically cited. what
information do you need?
incident report numbers.
file numbers.
right.
and how are we going
to know those numbers
if we don't know those numbers?
if you don't know
really what you want,
what are you doing here?
two murders of dea agents
have happened on my watch.
and it's my job to
investigate them,
and i'm asking for your help.
just have the chief fire off a letter,
and we'll see what we can do.
thank you for coming in.
have a nice day, y'all.
fucking us attorney
and their own general counsel?
these guys are scared.
hey. you're brentwood,
you're jackson, right?
yeah.
you working the agent
nailed to the ceiling?
what do you know about that?
the dea is a dysfunctional
family, all right?
no one's going to talk
family business with you.
who are you?
got a card?
ask yourself why it happened.
everything happens for a reason.
think about that.
stop leaving your
shit on my seat.
that's not mine.
it's not some porn you're
hiding from your wife?
that's not mine.
it's not mine.
you're out here saving
these adrenaline junkies
that mean absolutely nothing
to this department.
i would take
a bullet for those guys.
hmm. you'd take a bullet.
would you take 10 million bucks?
would you take $10 million?
where's the money?
don't fucking scream at me!
where's the money?
you dumb fuck, you!
look at you!
with your fucking 48% body fat.
and, you, scrawny lime bastard!
- fuck you guys!
- go to the gym, john.
fucking liar.
fucking liar!
he's a fucking liar.
what? caroline,
where you going?
why the fuck didn't you tell me
you were under investigation for
stealing from the rios-garza cartel?
get in.
i need a drink.
i need you to be
straight with me, john.
no, you be straight with me.
why do i have to find out
through the grapevine
that you linked
the deaths of my people?
they're linked,
i'm sorry. my turn.
did you steal the money?
no.
and fuck you for asking.
don't be such a girl.
your agency thinks you did.
so does the rios-garza cartel.
why do you think
they're killing your guys?
spend enough time on the
job, the job bites back.
that's bullshit.
you going somewhere?
one of my guys quit the team.
he's off the grid.
i gotta warn him.
okay, grab your stuff
and i'll drive.
they're going to continue
to fucking kill people,
and kill fucking innocent people
and women and children in
mexico and the united states
- unless you have guys like me!
- son!
that's a fact.
son!
motherfucker, i quit.
last fall, an 8-year-old girl
vanished from her bed.
no leads.
only her daddy's bullshit
about hearing black voices.
and he's a drinker. joins aa
the week after she disappears.
he profiles' too.
domestic abuser, all that.
and i can't find enough
for the da to file.
do you see where this is going?
just because you're not in jail
doesn't mean you didn't do ii.
you're awesome on a road trip,
you know that?
yeah, i've heard that before.
that's it, right there.
it's beautiful.
watch out for booby traps.
bullshit.
i'm serious.
this could take
your leg right off.
here's the trip wire.
why is he so paranoid?
maybe he doesn't want to
get nailed to a ceiling.
tripod!
mcneely?
it's john!
there's something off.
fuck.
unit 2150.
send me two units
and an me to my location.
ak brass.
the guy hit the trip wire.
right there.
looks like he bled out.
here, hold this.
what's that?
they' re world-class assholes.
give me the weapon.
i don't trust you.
well, you know, it was
getting heavy anyway.
hey!
how you feeling?
i'm sorry
well, now that you got
sucked into our world.
they're kaibiles.
kaibiles?
guatemalan special forces.
okay. -
rios-garza organization loves to
use them for high-power hits.
you know, mcneely was
a fucking navy seal.
he was 10 times the
operator that i'll ever be.
what chance do you think i got?
see, they're the best
assassins that money can buy.
honey, i worked gangs
for eight years.
streets have rules, okay?
you steal money, doesn't
matter who you are,
you can be a cop,
you could be god,
they will get you.
i came here to help you.
no, you did not.
to help you understand.
you came here 'cause you
think you're gonna be next.
you came here to steer me, okay?
if you want to help me,
and if you don't want to
get nailed to a ceiling
or run over by a train,
you need to break
free from your buddies
and tell me something i don't
know about john wharton.
because i can't read him.
tell me something i don't know.
two years ago,
we arrested
edgar rios in juarez.
he was an old-school drug lord,
ran all their operations.
it was a big deal.
we're handing him
over to the mexicans
when some broad pulls
her shit and dumps him.
cartel didn't want him
debriefed by our intel people.
problem sowed.
bu! they had
a bigger problem.
they wanted the man who can get
the man that nobody can get.
john gets a call
from the bad guys.
they snatched his wife and kid right
out of his house on lake lanier.
they're holding them in juarez.
they make him an often.
"surrender yourself to the
cartel and your family lives."
john's family is everything.
john was married forever.
his son jacob was
his best friend.
love you, dad.
they tortured karen
and jacob to death.
there's video.
evil shit.
no! no! no!
they mailed pieces of
them to his home for weeks.
oh, my god!
oh, my god!
so john
went down there. alone.
hunting the man
who killed his wife.
john, we're coming in!
he didn't find him.
we're here to
bring you back home.
this isn't going
to bring them back.
come on.
let's go home.
john is obsessed with
finding his wife's killer.
it's like a cancer in his soul.
caroline, we lost john
when they died.
go home.
go home now.
i was just trying to help.
i'm sorry.
i'm so sorry.
john.
wait up. i didn't know about your family.
john, i'm sorry, i...
now you know.
they sent me her face.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
so this isn't creepy.
someone else get killed?
i brought a peace offering.
let me show you something.
your shooters. they're
guatemalan special forces.
they came in through
juarez with stolen visas.
ice alerted, ran surveillance.
but lost them
outside of atlanta.
now, you said you had prints.
yeah. we got one
at the rv,
and one outside mcneely's cabin.
but no ncic hits.
see if these match.
pretty please.
ice took them off some beer
cans inside their hotel room.
should i have these?
no.
then why'd you give them to me?
i don't want anything
to happen to you.
holy shit.
no way.
don't say a word.
mmm-mmm-mmm.
what happened to
"i'll never date a cop"?
who said anything about a date?
evil harlot.
i can't believe you said that.
you dirty, dirty girl.
so i got a present for you.
check that out.
oh!
bad guys.
dude looks like mario from donkey kong.
mmm-hmm.
who's the metrosexual
with the... you've got...
prints, records, everything.
did he leave it on
your night stand?
you don't want to know.
shit.
get in the car. you all right?
'cause you walking funny.
you're just jealous.
is he a big dude?
like, is he big?
that's inappropriate.
was it good?
shut up. shut up.
is he ripped,
like a six-pack?
shut up.
just wondering. 'cause
he's, like, a legend.
you're good to go.
it's a match.
thank you' tish. okay, i'm going
to write out a warrant-affidavit.
you put out a bolo,
armed and dangerous.
yeah, and what you
gonna tell the judge?
that we got slipped some
secret squirrel ice file?
that's exactly what
i'm going to tell him.
once they're in custody, we can get
as many print cards as we want.
doesn't matter how we get
there, as long as we get there.
do we know where they are?
negative.
so we still got no target?
what the hell are
we doing sitting here?
we could be drinking beers, throwing
dollars at something naked.
we're standing by.
for what?
apparently, the boss got that
investigator lady working for us now.
ain't that right, boss?
is that true?
hey. grab a vest.
what's up, partner?
that ice file your boyfriend
gave you had a credit card.
i linked it to a cell phone.
that cell phone is live
in an apartment building.
that apartment building,
narco knows about it.
it's a rios-garza
safe house.
okay, enough
energy drinks, partner.
while you've been saving
mankind, i drafted an affidavit.
i sent it to the clerk,
judge signed it.
you'll be needing that
okay. yes, you're right.
i need that.
you're right.
i'm sorry. i was excited.
try and arrest
him without it, huh'?
i got excited about it, but we
gotta go kick some doors, baby.
multi-level residential.
four units.
brick and masonry. fortified
with barred windows.
steel security doors. you got an
iron fence around three sides.
all right,
what's the plan, boss?
we blue angel up the back.
single point dynamic entry.
explosive breach.
we don't know
what unit they're in,
so we clear the whole structure.

we're at the rail road tracks.

no matter what, we all go home
tonight at the end of this mission.

fucking shit.
stay tight.
behind you, brother.
all right, it's clear.
get ems in here.
there's a lot of bodies.
what the fuck
are you doing here?
it's my job.
you used me.
breacher, god damn it!
what the fuck is going on here?
clean up, aisle three.
god almighty!
what's wrong? son of
a bitch is snagged!
gimme a knife. i'm gonna
cut the son of a bitch.
the hell you are.
that's a new anchor.
damn, it is heavy, though.
yeah, it is!
all right, keep pulling.
what the hell?
jesus christ!
stay back, son!
turn around.
don't look.
how'd they die?
looks like a gun fight.
can you give me race and sex?
male hispanics, all three.
why the chicken wire?
as their bodies bloat, the wire cuts
them, releasing the decomp gas.
they never float to the surface.
yeah, great tip.
i gotta remember that one.
okay, how long they been dead?
a week.
you sure?
a what?
at least a week.
if it's the guys
that we think...
they've been dead more than a week...
wait, are these the...
the military guys from the cartel?
yeah.
you think this is them?
the guatemalans.
i think it's them.
he said they've
been dead for a week.
it can't be the guatemalans.
that's why
we need to find these tattoos.
the guy at the cabin had a
tattoo on his left shoulder.
and if we have a match, then they're
part of the same gang, right?
the killers are the victims?
it just can't be that, caroline.
tattoo, left shoulder.
have we got anything?
ah, nice!
we got it.
darius, come see this.
this is our guy.
that's it'?
mmm-hmm.
who the hell killed them?
nice.
here we go.
what you got?
thumb's missing.
right here.
right.
okay, so that explains how we got
thumbprints in roberts' rv, huh?
looks like we're working late.
look, if they've been dead
a week already, right?
they sure as hell didn't
nail jordan to that ceiling.
or drive roberts
over the train tracks.
the guatemalans
killed tripod mcneely, okay?
then somebody kills them,
uses them for cover.
come on, darius, think about it.
who killed the cartel hit men,
sprinkles their dna over
two separate crime scenes,
wants us to think they're alive'?
who do we like for this?
everybody! we like
everybody for this one!
{on tape)
john, please! john!
tell john to come for you!
john! please, john!
tell him come for you!
john!
come find me! john!
please!
oh' no!
we had a good time, didn't we'!?
who the fuck is hunting us?
who do you think, breach?
it's one of us.
it's you!
or it's grinder!
or sugar! or my dear
loving husband!
is it you, bitch?
no, i keep track
of the people i whack.
neck and pyro ain't on the list.
see, i think that she's right!
i think she's fucking right.
nailed it.
so which fucker is ii, huh?
fucking crazy!
i mean, why?
you know why, breach.
it was the fucking money.
amen.
'cause some of us
are getting paid,
and the rest of us
are just getting dead.
oh, bullshit!
keep your hands
where we can see them.
this has been fun,
but i'm out of here.
i see any of your fucking
faces and i'll kill you!
ammo's cheap.
my life ain't!
it's over.
where'd you bury it, grinder?
now we fall apart?
we scatter to the wind?
yeah, i like that idea.
honey.
yes, sweetheart?
i've been fucking sugar.
what the fuck are you doing?
that's not what we talked about!
look, man.
look, it is what it is, dude.
what do you want me to say?
you want me to say i'm sorry?
is it gonna make it any better?
you fucker!
i'm going to kill you!
monster! no!
i thought you were
my fucking friend!
boss, i'm gonna kill him!
i'm gonna fucking kill him!
get the fuck out of here!
why the fuck would
you do that shit?
get the fuck out of here!
fucking have a nice life,
you fucking cunt!
you deserve each other!
i warned you.
we fucked up.
we fucked up, didn't we?
what do you want?
can we talk?
we stole the money.
it was breacher's idea.
we thought it
would make him happy.
it was $10 million in cash.
went back for it that night,
but when we got there,
it was gone.
dea, they wanted to
throw us in a hole
and throw away the hole.
crawled up our asses with a
microscope for six months.
nobody broke.
so who has the money?
it's lizzy.
or monster or sugar.
i don't know.
she's playing one
against the other.
what do you want to do?
fuck them all.
let them hang.
after i lost my family,
i asked myself what
was i fighting for.
the answer was simple.
my team.
i wanted them to get
something out of all of this.
but instead,
i destroyed them.
agent phillips is
going to the dea.
i'm not telling you
it's gonna be okay.
because it's not.
not for you.
hey, john.
hey.
i'm sorry.
don't apologize.
i would have stepped
up if you didn't.
you're doing the right thing.
i ride this ship down.
i ride it down.
but you,
you could still
have a life after this.
doing what, john?
where?
this is all i do.
and it's over.
we can protect you.
get down!
stay down.
tell me again.
we were up the block,
heard gunfire.
we made contact with
a female dea agent.
female dea agent?
she left in a vehicle
with a black male.
a dea agent.
you heard gunfire!
sir, she badged us.
she was legit.
she left.
is this the woman you saw?
yeah. that's her.
you said "black male"?
yes, sir.
a red vehicle.
sugar that's your guy, too?
clear.
what's all this?
she's bailing.
she'll never make it. every cop
in georgia's looking for her.
she won't get far.
yes, she will.
do you think that he loves you?
what do you think the plan is? to
just go run off and make babies?
well, you're gonna
be needing this.
just give me my shit
and quit fucking around.
don't do it! monster!
fuck you!
oh, fuck.
baby, i'm sorry!
