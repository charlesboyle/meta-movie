<i>narrator: by the standards
of the yucatén jungle,</i>
<i>the female ruby-throated
hummingbird is a plain jane.</i>
<i>in the weeks
leading to her migration,</i>
<i>she eats almost
continuously.</i>
<i>to survive the journey, she
must double her body weight.</i>
<i>the sooty shearvvater, on the
other hand, must lose weight</i>
<i>before setting out on his first
migration from tasmania.</i>
<i>his goal, to shed
half his body weight.</i>
<i>the north american programmer</i>
<i>would be content to lose
just a few pounds.</i>
<i>but the task is difficult.</i>
<i>he has a demanding job,
a brutal schedule,</i>
<i>precious little willpower,</i>
<i>and an all-consuming
secret life.</i>
yo! big bad brad.
mmm?
what you
rocking out to, man?
um...
male voice:
<i>clark's</i> nutcracker.

anything like his passion for birds.</i>
<i>not even the female

hello?
<i>brad?</i>
hey, vicki?
hi, i was just thinking about you
look, there's something
i've got to tell you.
i'm getting
married again.
<i>and we're
announcing it tonight</i>
<i>and i didn't want you to
hear it from just somebody.</i>
<i>brad?
are you still there?</i>
yeah. that is great.
congratulations. i was just
<i>taking it in.
that is good news. thanks.</i>
<i>i'm sorry,
i'm a little distracted.</i>
because i've got some pretty
huge news of my own, actually.
i'm gonna do a big year.
<i>great!</i>
yeah.
what is that again?
<i>what's a big year?</i>
(jazz music playing)
<i>narrator:
well into the 19th century,</i>
<i>americans celebrated
christmas day</i>
<i>with contests to kill the
most birds in a single day.</i>
<i>in 1900, audubon society
ornithologist frank chapman</i>
<i>suggested americans should
count them instead,</i>
<i>leading eventually to the
creation of the big year,</i>
<i>a competition to see the
greatest number of birds</i>
<i>in north america
in a calendar year.</i>
(exclaiming) whoa!
<i>in 2003, new jersey roofing
contractor kenny bostick's big year</i>
<i>resulted in an astonishing
<i>breaking sandy komito's
north american record.</i>
<i>many believe that
bostick's record of 732</i>
<i>would stand forever,
especially mrs. bostick.</i>
jessica: a big year?
kenny, you promised me you were
never gonna do another big year.
jess, i'm just going out
to set the pace.
i promise i'll be back
as soon as i'm sure
there's no one out there
who can break my record.
your record.
what's the big deal?
the big deal? hey, "lance
armstrong, what's the big deal?"
or, hey, "columbus, what's the big
deal with that whole new world thing?"
didn't you tell me that a big year
killed your marriage to steph in '03?
first of all, i was married
to bridget in '03.
didn't you tell me that a big year
killed your marriage to bridget?
a contributing factor,
but, no, not the main reason.
there were so many other
problems with that marriage.
kenny, i'm getting fertility treatments!
and you promised.
you said you were gonna build
a new room for the baby.
i know.
that was before <i>el niño.</i>
now i'm really worried someone's
gonna try to beat 732.
<i>narrator: the reigning
king is right to worry.</i>
<i>somebody is going to try
to be beat 732.</i>
<i>but the programmer is not the
only challenger for the title.</i>
<i>two hundred miles north,</i>
<i>another fanatical birder is also
making plans for a big year.</i>
we're still nowhere
on the deal.
chemwall won't budge
on any key points.
mclntire used to work
for you.
maybe if you negotiated
with him directly...
sorry, guys.
january 1st, i'm outta here.
oh, right,
you're retiring again.
again.
this time i mean it.
next year is all
about the birds.
edith's already in colorado
setting up the new house.
so live in the new house
and work from home.
use the jet.
i mean, it's your jet
it's your company!
jim: forget the birds.
you're big boys now.
you'll be fine without me.
you realize, of course, that the phase after
retirement looks a little bit like this.
<i>narrator: the ceo is
frustrated by the persistence</i>
<i>of his migrating instinct
into late adulthood.</i>
am i nuts, edith?
maybe i should do my big year next year.
it might make more sense.
no. go do it now, stu.
<i>carpe annum!</i>
seize the...
year.
so that's it?
complete support?
you're not even gonna
try and stop me?
stu, i love you, and i will miss
you dearly when you're away.
but you have been dreaming about
this since you were a little boy,
and i am not gonna stand between
you and your greatest passion.
not my greatest passion.
all: three, two, one!
happy new year!
hey.
excuse me! excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.
i just want to make
a little toast to my folks.
hey, okay.
to my dad,
who proved today that he can
still kick my ass on skis.
hey, i let you win a few just
to keep you hanging around.
my childhood in a nutshell,
ladies and gentlemen.
(all laughing)
and to my mom, who had the
vision and confidence
to design a house with enough
room for grandchildren.
man: hear, hear.
if you build it,
they will come.
yes, and in this case,
sometime around
the middle of may.
(exclaiming)
yes! rea“y?
that's why she was tossing
her cookies all month.
you're not the only one
having a big year, dad.
congratulations. hey.
<i>woman: narba hot-line.

<i>there has been a second spotting

you ready?
to the bottom?
you're on, old man.
we'll see about that.
edith, count us off.
on your mark.
get set. go!
you'd think they'd be
exhausted by now.
they're men, dear.
if they ever stop competing, they die.
<i>narrator: the reigning king
knows few have the time,</i>
<i>resources or expertise

<i>some have already fallen by
the wayside due to injury.</i>
(groans)
<i>while others have seen
their nest eggs depleted.</i>

brenda: i have
some exciting news.
i'm gonna be working
as a travel agent again.
for who?
for brad.
i'm handling his travel
for the next year.
travel? travel where?
i'm doing
a big year, dad.
spending the year trying to see <i>as</i>
many different species of bird as i can.
i've been dreaming about
this for a long time.
this is my year.
i've saved 5 grand and i'm
gonna need five more,
and i was wondering if you'd
consider sponsoring me?
sponsoring you.
i'd pay you back.
with interest.
think of it <i>as</i> an investment.
an investment.
yeah, sure.
yeah, definitely.
yeah, it sounds like
a great investment.
i just hope
word doesn't get out.
all the neighbors will want
a piece of the action.
(plate clangs)
you know what? forget it.
i'm gonna do it myself, so...
you're 36 years old!
you quit grad school.
you quit your job at dell.
you quit your marriage.
sooner or later, you're gonna have to
actually do something with your life!
this is what i'm doing!
but i guess you got it
all figured out.
that's why your whole life
has been nothing but bliss!
bill, tower one's
good to go.
i'll debug the rest
when i get back monday.
yeah, that bird thing, right?
yeah.
listen, i'll pay you time-and-a-half
to work this weekend and catch us up.
that'd pay for a lot
of airfare, right?
thanks, bill, but i'm already
getting a late start as it is.
so, what do you win?
is there prize money?
no prize money, but the
birdseed endorsements are huge.
seriously?
no.
okay, so why
do you do it?
it's kind of
hard to explain.
you know what's hard
to explain? to them?
a core meltdown of the new reactor that
irradiates the entire atlantic coast.
okay. shit.
double-time.
and that's unprecedented.
okay. but i am definitely
leaving on the 20th.

red-tailed hawk.
<i>a xantus's hummingbird has been seen in a
backyard in gibsons, british columbia.</i>
<i>the xantus's
is code five.</i>
(bell ringing)
how do you do, ma'am?
i was wondering if...
the hummingbird's
out there now.
let me just get you
the key to the gate.
oh! fantastic.
i've been meaning to ask
one of you people,
do you have to get a snapshot of the bird?
is that a rule?
no. believe it or not, it's all on
the old-fashioned honor system.
but you just have
to say you saw it?
no. in fact, if you can recognize a bird
by its song, you just have to hear it.
oh.
but i see everybody
with a camera.
you really want a photograph
if it's a rare one,
same as you would
the taj mahal.
oh! stay on the path.
i'll bring it right back.
(cell phone ringing)
this is stu.
stu, it's barry.
i'm here with jim
and the lawyers.
<i>we just need a little help.
stu. stu?</i>
stu? (grunts)
<i>stu: goddamn it!</i>
i hope we're not catching
you at a bad time.
as a matter of fact...
<i>look, we need
a little expert guidance.</i>
<i>we have reached an impasse
with chemwall.</i>
they don't...
it's going south, stu.
they don't want to give up their
production facilities in nevada.
<i>hold out.
their r & d is prehistoric.</i>
it's all about the real estate.
look, i gotta go.
i'm about to miss
a code five.
no, no...
(line disconnects)
what the hell's
he talking about?
birds.
(grunting disappointedly)
(bird chirping)
brad: "one of the greatest
birders i've ever seen"?
me?
crane, i'm touched.
do you ever think
about doing a big year?
you could be
the next bostick.
(chirping)
<i>narrator: the programmer has
developed a remarkable ability.</i>
western tanager.
(grunts)
(sighs)
<i>he can recognize hundreds
of species by sound alone.</i>
hey, all you birders.
i'm annie auklet.
if you haven't sailed with me
before, yep, that's my real name.
i love those seabirds
so damn much,
i had it
legally changed in 1990.
(men laughing)
now a couple of rules.
if you can't swim,
wear a life jacket.
rule number two,
i'm in charge
of this itinerary.
and if you have
a problem with that,
you can take your
candy-colored butt
and put it right back
in the rental car.
all right.
come on, line up.
what was that all about?
back in '03, annie stopped
a boat to look at a whale
and bostick
led a mutiny.
look, no one paid
to see shamu!
get the hell
off my bridge!
just show us something
with some feathers
or let me
steer this thing!
now you're gonna cut me?
get off my bridge, pal!
'cause we won't
look at your whale?
i'll use you for chum!
you're crazier
than a road lizard!
he kind of had a point.
no, he is in violation of all the
unwritten rules for decorum and civility.
yeah, well, maybe that's what it takes
to be the greatest birder on earth.
or maybe it just takes adding
a few birds to your list
that perhaps
you never saw.
whoa. are you saying
bostick's a cheater?
i'm just saying it'd be wise to
keep your eye on the sparrow.
boy: that record'll
never be broken.
yep.
thanks, man.
thanks, man!
thanks.
now, why would i help a pig like
you win another big year, bostick?
because if he were trying
to do another big year,
a pig like me
wouldn't want any help.
but i'm not, annie.
i'm just looking.
just trying to reconnect
with that little boy
who fell in love with blue jays and
mourning doves a million years ago.
you're not gonna
deny me that.
come on, have a heart.
just stay the hell
off my bridge.
deal.
(mimics bird hooting)
western screech owl.
capital. yes.
you.
okay.
(mimics bird screeching)
red-shouldered hawk.
close, but no cigar.
red-tailed hawk?
yes! you, sir,

(birds squawking)

straight ahead.
kittiwake!
<i>narrator: the reigning
king's hackles are raised.</i>
<i>as with most alpha males,</i>
<i>his instinct for
potential rivals is keen.</i>
<i>he lulls his prey,
then pounces.</i>
seasickness? i feel for you.
that's the worst.
these usually help.
yeah, some people say they're
just a placebo. who knows?
oh! here we go!
cod liver oil.
attracts birds
like honey,
but smells like
fried cat puke.
sorry, shouldn't have said
"puke." won't bother me.
lost my sense of smell in a
chem lab explosion years ago.
that's lucky.
now, you want to be careful
with those binocs.
'cause once you lose sight of
that horizon, you can get lost.
and then
you're done for,
'cause all you feel is
the pitching and tossing.
pitching and tossing.
pitching and tossing.
i'm fine.
i'm fine.
hey, anybody up for
a little fish-head sushi?
(men laughing)
kenny: mmm.
pitching and tossing.
pitching and tossing.
pitching and tossing.
whoa!
(retching)
you guys got a rag
or something?
there we go.
maybe one with not so
much fish guts on it?
brad: you okay?
it's not easy
being green.
(laughs)
<i>narrator: weather and planning are
deemed the factors most essential</i>
<i>to a successful big year.</i>
<i>but happenstance and
instinct are just as vital.</i>
hey, did you get a chance to see
that black-footed albatross?
i sure did. thanks.
i'll leave you at peace.
no, actually,
it helps to talk.
but i wouldn't want you
to miss any birds.
ah! we're headed back.
besides, if there's anything
important, i'll know
'cause i can
recognize them all by ear.
no.
oh, yeah.
really?
(squawking)
what's that?
that's bostick
imitating a herring gull.
splendid!
great!
bostick. i have him
to thank for this.
what do you mean?
he psyched me out.
made me seasick.
i think he thinks
i'm doing a big year.
that is hardcore.
are you doing
a big year?
no. you?
kenny: come on,
let's speed it up!
the lad inside <i>says</i>
there's a suitable hotel
on the 101,
halfway to mount shasta.
hotel? what, you think a snowy owl's
just gonna wait for us? uh-uh.
only reason why i invited you was so we
can drive straight through. chop, chop!
(tires screech)
<i>brenda: i can get you 10%
off the hotel in savannah.</i>
and i can put you on a direct
flight, but it's $100 more.
better stay with
the two layovers then.
and your dad
wants to talk to you.
no. no, mom. mom, no.
brenda: yeah. oh!
he's grabbing the phone!
yeah. he's grabbing
the phone!
<i>no, no, no.
don't hand it to him.</i>
<i>mom? mom.
i don't want to talk to him. yeah!</i>
<i>yeah!</i>
where is our
world traveler today?
oregon.
looking for seabirds.
<i>oregon. i guess everybody
needs a vacation.</i>
it's not a vacation, dad.
it's not work.
unless somebody's paying you to
stay in hotels and look at birds.
<i>dad! okay, okay, okay, you're right.
i'm sorry.</i>
i guess i'm just kind of confused
about what a vacation is.
okay, dad, you know what?
i gotta run.
hey. hey. brad?
great talking to you.
(screeching)
(honking)
(screams)
dear god.
probably could have used
another cup of coffee.
(bird pecking)
i think i broke my arm.
(shushing) shut up.
<i>narrator: in nature, the
difference between life and death</i>
<i>is very often

unbelievable.
this is the rarest bird
i've ever seen.
it's like we were
meant to crash here.
we were.

survived</i> a <i>near-fatal crash,</i>
<i>only to stumble upon
a great spotted woodpecker,</i>
<i>a code four for him.</i>
<i>there is no greater proof of the
righteousness of his crusade.</i>

feel so broke, does it?
you could
chop my arm off.
how's the conference?
how bad could it be?
it's paris.
how's it going there?
glorious! dawn just broke.
tamaulipas crows'll
be here any minute.
i'm happy for you.
but i wish you were here.
(laughs)
you're just jealous.
mmm. green.
what was that?
i'm renovating.
again? i thought we just got
done redoing the whole house.
uh-huh. but not the
upstairs and the kitchen.
<i>whoa, the kitchen?</i>
i thought we had
an agreement that
we were gonna wait
on doing the kitchen.
i thought you agreed to wait
to do another big year.
jess, i've told you,
the birds wait for no man.
<i>and neither do i.</i>
so i had to hire frank falucci,
seeing as you're so busy.
you hired my competitor?
that's gonna drag on forever.
<i>no, 'cause i said to frank</i>
that i'd give him a bonus
if he was done by april.
<i>a bonus?</i>
all right,
but, jeez, babe, please,
you've got to
keep an eye on this.
you cannot
trust contractors.
i'm well aware, honey.
okay, so is it old man frank
in charge of the job,
<i>or is it his kind of good-looking
son who's doing it?</i>
he's not that good-looking.
where are you, anyway?
<i>i'm in wyoming.
i got to bag a sage grouse.</i>

no.
it's hot and dusty.
it's a real dump.

yes, i am.

<i>tonight, this bird
who typically eats</i>
<i>every 20 minutes
just to stay healthy,</i>
<i>must cross 500 miles of
featureless blackness,</i>
<i>high above
the gulf of mexico.</i>
<i>weeks of sustained eating have
prepared her for the journey,</i>

yeah, it was.
all right, falucci, i'm gonna be going
over your time sheets like a hawk,

ease up on the snack breaks.

is birds, bostick!
yeah, it is.

no. no! what the...
<i>jess?</i>
hello, stranger.
this is a rare sighting. hi.
yeah. what have you done
to our house?
do you like it so far?
so far?
please don't tell me there's more to come!
this is crazy!
are you trying to get my attention?
it worked.
is that the point
of all this?
i don't know. i don't know, kenny.
what is the point?
i'm surprised to still see
this room standing,
that you didn't take
a sledgehammer to this.
i'm supposed to put my
life on hold for a year?
like a pathetic
golf widow?
you're not a golf widow.
you can't compare golf to this.
golf's just like a hobby.
and the birding
is what exactly?
i don't know, it's like a calling.
this is like my calling.
like gandhi?
no, come on. i'm not comparing
myself to gandhi, okay?
that's ridiculous. okay?
it's more like i'm mozart, i guess.
okay, fine. you got a calling.
i got a calling, too.
it's known <i>as</i> a baby.
yeah.
i know. i like to think that that's
like another one of my callings, too.
and you're gonna have to contribute,
you realize, eventually.
i realize.
in person.
yes. in person.
i wouldn't want it any other way.
really? 'cause i ain't
so sure, wolfgang.
maybe i can
convince you.
i didn't mean now.
come on. what's
the matter with now?
'cause we have a house

<i>and i'm gonna
let it shine...</i>
ever get the feeling
you're being followed?
hello, master.
how you doing, stu?
still filling
those weekends, i see.
unless you and your son here
are doing a big year.
(chuckles) oh! kenny bostick,
this is my friend brad harris.
who's also not doing
a big year.
that's funny how
nobody's doing a big year.
yeah. with all this
fallout and <i>el niño.</i>
yeah, i know, you'd think the
conditions are just set up perfect
for someone to have a real
shot at breaking my record.
not that record.
pink-footed goose!
pink-footed goose,
other end of the boardwalk.
what the hell's
that doing here?
man: be careful!
hey, put her down!
hey, hey, please,
let the explorers through!
of course.
let's go, ladies. jeesh.
after you, kids.
get those badges.
chop, chop, chop, chop!
step it up! stepping lively!
move it along!
thank you.
she took off. headed north.
probably be in iceland by friday.
boy, she was a beaut, too!
hey, is that a calliope?
just another
ruby-throated.
on everybody's list
by march.
sorry to disappoint
you boys again.
<i>narrator: not just another
ruby-throated, but our ruby.</i>
<i>drenched and diminished, frail
and trembling, but alive.</i>
<i>alive! alive!</i>
good evening. tonight's special is quail.
i highly recommend it.
i couldn't.
yeah, not tonight.
i'll have the halibut.
and a bottle of
this montrachet.
of course.
and i will have the soup.
thank you.
really? after being outside
all day in the wind and rain?
kind of a light eater.
and the truth is
the prices here are a little
steeper than i'm used to.
brad, i invited you to dinner.
i know, but...
no, it's my pleasure.
look, when i'm birding, i don't
fly first class or hire guides.
it's too much like corked
bats and steroids to me.
but tonight
we're celebrating.
we saw 136 species!
brad, 136!
here's to them.
and to the one
who got away.
pink-footed goose.
the montrachet.
good. and my friend would like
to see the menu again, please.
waiter: of course.
cool.
that shrimp scampi was calling
my name, if you must know.
that's a little too much.
okay.
<i>narrator: in the afterglow
of their extraordinary day,</i>
<i>the programmer and the roving
ceo forge a warm friendship</i>
<i>deeply rooted in
their shared passion.</i>
i mean, i'm 36.
i'm divorced.
i have a job i hate.
i just want to do something big, you know?
make my mark.
so what are you gonna do?
i'm working on something.
(exclaims dismissively)
my dad doesn't get it.
he's had the same
boring job for 40 years.
"that's what people do,"
he says.
he's right.
most people just stay on the
beaten path, then one day,
they wake up and realize they didn't
do everything they wanted to do.
look at me.
i was so afraid to retire,
i had to do it twice before
i finally got out here.
why'd you wait so long?
'cause i'm an idiot.
okay, i gotta tell you.
i'm doing a big year.
wow.
i know.
<i>narrator: the retired
ceo faces a dilemma.</i>
<i>he feels true kinship
with the programmer.</i>
<i>should he divulge
his own big year?</i>
don't tell anybody, okay?
<i>but with the exception of
certain pernicious bacteria,</i>
<i>homo sapiens is the most
competitive species on earth.</i>
mum's the word.
we won't have
to eat for a week.
i'm hurting.
great dinner.
good luck.
thanks again.
hey, it's me,
mozart.
the fallout's over
and now i'm calling
to deal with the fallout
from the fallout.
<i>look, babe, i'm sorry.
i'm gonna make it up to you, you'll see.</i>
i'm going to...
<i>where are you, anyway?
it's late there.</i>
<i>i hope you're okay, babe.
oh! where am</i> i?
i'm shooting hormones into my butt
so i can have your baby, kenny.
<i>okay, i'm going to
hit the sack here,</i>
<i>but i will try you
in the morning,</i>
and i'm gonna be
launching a new thing
called operation
sweep her off her feet.
<i>so, you might
want to get ready,</i>
<i>'cause it's gonna be
pretty spectacular.</i>
<i>okay? all right.
talk to you tomorrow.</i>
pomarine jaeger,
nine o'clock!
brad.
brad!
no.
oh! sorry.
sorry.

<i>stu: i still feel like a heel.

but i'm afraid if he
knew about my big year,
bostick'd get it
out of him eventually.
and why is it so important to
keep this secret from bostick?
<i>less competition
he thinks he has,</i>
the more he's likely to

(sighs)
i love you.

we agreed to a do-or-die
session, may 14th,
<i>here in new york
in our office.</i>
i can't. impossible.
<i>i'm flying to attu
on the 14th.</i>
to where?
attu, alaska.
and i can't miss the flight.
there's not another one
for a week.
stu, you're not involved,
the deal dies.
look, you gave these
people their jobs.
if you don't do something,
they're gonna lose them!
<i>and that means a hell of a lot
more than some birds on attu.</i>
<i>narrator: attu. the westernmost
island of the aleutian chain.</i>
<i>so far west, it's closer to
tokyo than to anchorage.</i>
<i>there are no hotels,
no phones,</i>
<i>no restaurants

<i>but for birders,
attu is paradise.</i>
<i>nobody could hope to win a big year
without going to attu in may.</i>
(knocking on door)
mom's taxi service!
i'm sorry i'm late.
you're gonna be a little
chilly in alaska.
i'm not going.
stop packing.
i'm serious! mom!
are you upset because
you think you can't win,
or because
he lied to you?
both.
and what about bostick?
who?
kenny bostick, the best
birder in the world.
i think he might be
doing another big year.
what chance do i have?
oh, brad, you have 486 birds.
you're on a record pace.
you can't quit now!
mom, my credit card is maxed out.
no. no. no. no.
even if i go to alaska, there's
no way i can complete the year!
this has 8 $6,000 limit.
bring me back
some alaska pictures.
no, mom, i can't.
no, no, no, no.
get dressed.
your plane leaves in an hour.
don't piss off
your travel agent.
i had no idea this car
could go this fast.
if you miss this plane,
there's not another
one for a week.
so, we gotta do it.
mom, mom, mom!
welcome back, mr. preissler!
thank you.
thanks for
being here, stu.
stu: i can give you
four hours, that's it.
then i've got to catch
my flight to alaska.
barry: no problem.
jim: how was your trip?
louisiana was spectacular.
lot of birds
in the bayou.
and saw a loggerhead shrike from
my hotel room in natchitoches.
adorable!
it imitates the songs of other
birds to lure them in close.
uh-huh.
then it impales them on thorns,
breaks their necks and eats them.
yeesh!
stu: we'll assume the cost
of retrofitting the plants,
but that still leaves
the non-compete clause.
barry says you have
an issue with it.
no. it's not a big issue,
but i'm not like you, stu.
i'm not ready to hang it all up so i can
spend the rest of my life bird watching.
(men laughing)
it's called
"birding," rick.
and there's no
wiggle room here.
this is a deal-breaker
for us.
wait, what?
wait, wait, wait.
four hours ago, you said that
everything was negotiable.
what, was this just so you could
lure me in to finish me off?
the shrike.
it's 11:15
i should have left for the
airport 15 minutes ago.
all right. stu! just wait, one
second, please. one second.
let me talk to my people.
just give me five minutes. okay?
(indistinct)
okay, stu, 48 months
and you got a deal.
they'll shake.
the lexington side!
okay, i'm coming out now!
are you there?
come up! pull up in front!
there's taxis there. flash your lights!
go! go, go, go, go!
kenny? this is karen,
my blushing bride.
attu's gonna be
our honeymoon.
wow!
okay, now, karen, you're
not a birder, are you?
no. no, i'm just
along for the ride.
honeymoon on attu.
that should be
unforgettable.
yeah.
(mouthing) attu?
what were you thinking?
come on, let's go!
what are we waiting for?
the charter's sold out, but two
guys haven't shown up yet.
brad: i'm here!
okay, sorry.
sorry i'm late.
sorry. sorry i'm late.
okay.
(sighs)
nice of you
to join us.
you're stu's little
sidekick, aren't you?
oh, yeah,
me and stu are like that.
i know all his secrets.
yeah? cookie?
yeah, thanks.
all his secrets.
(chuckles)
apparently, he's doing
a big year. oops.
he probably wouldn't
want you to know that.
what's his total?
by now? over 500.
hey! hey!
hey! hey!
gives him a shot at your
record, doesn't it?
yeah. yeah, that...
he's a pretty
spry old guy.
he's definitely got
a shot at my record.
of course, he probably would have had a
better shot if he had made this flight.
(exclaiming
in disappointment)
oh, god.
what's your total?
hmm?
what's your total?
i'm not doing a big year. no?
mmm-mmm.
another cookie?
no, one's my limit.
the pilot says this
is a siberian storm?
attu island, meet <i>el niño.</i>
makes for great birding.
(screaming frantically)
(alarm beeping)

(sobbing)
(applauding) nice job up
there in the cockpit!
way to go, guys! attu!
bostick!
welcome, birders, to attu.
<i>welcome, birders, to attu.</i>
let's take this spot.
go right in here. in here.
okay. yeah.
man 1:
i'll take the top.
man 2: yeah.
welcome to
the honeymoon suite!
unforgettable.
wally, how are you?
hey, bostick.
(kenny exhaling)
kenny: that old attu air.
(whistling)
how you doing, dolores?
mrs. suzuki.
yeah.
oh, yeah.
here they are.
now i'm in attu.
prime real estate.
okay.
(mouse squeaking)
(exclaims)
i've only been here a week, and
my life list is already at 578.
you want to see?
are you serious?
yeah.
i'd love to.
that is the american...
that's so beautiful.
ellie:
yeah, golden plover.
mike: you guys
have the same eyes.
rustic bunting.
excuse me.
on megaphone: massacre valley.
<i>rustic bunting.</i>
coming through.
hurry!
massacre valley, come on!
let's go, let's go!
just follow us!
the south side trail.
kenny! rustic bunting!
really?
i'll catch up to you.
mary: go back!
go back, you guys!
the bunting flew back toward casco cove!
the other way!
the rustic bunting is up there!
bunting's gone up the hill!
turn around, turn around!
the bunting flew down
the hill! go back!
mary: what?
go back!
no, the bunting
flew down the hill!
<i>man on radio: gladys, we finally found the bunting.
it's at murder point.</i>

<i>it'll be tough out there

<i>tv anchor: but you were
telling me a moment ago,</i>
<i>there are at least
a few people</i>
<i>happy about this
siberian storm, right?</i>
<i>i can tell you that the birders
over at attu are going to love it.</i>
<i>so far they've spotted such
rarities as a pin-tailed snipe</i>
<i>and an oriental greenfinch.</i>
<i>tv anchor:
snipe and greenfinch.</i>
<i>and these are birds that nobody's
seen in north america for how long?</i>
<i>ten, 20, 30 years?</i>
<i>thirty years at least.
if ever.</i>
<i>tv anchor: and i'm happy
if i can spot a pigeon.</i>
(laughs sarcastically)
(sighs exhaustedly)
hey, brad!
i made it!
boy, oh, boy, are you a
sore for sight eyes, huh?
i was just headed out.
i wanted to tell you,
but bostick has a way of getting
information out of people.
yeah, i guess
he's not the only one.
i didn't get it out of you, brad.
you offered it to me.
oh, come on! you bought me
drinks and got what you wanted!
that's not why
i asked you to dinner.
i told you
about my wife.
my fear of retirement.
you think i'd discuss that
stuff with just anybody?
nope. just the people you
think are doing a big year.
brad, listen.
you were ready to talk
about your big year.
i wasn't ready to talk about mine.
that's all it was.
have you checked
your messages lately?
up here?
what, are you kidding me?
i left a full confession
five days ago.
i felt bad.
really?
i'm sorry.
okay.
i guess i have a
confession to make, too.
you told bostick,
didn't you?
yes. sorry.
on, well.
(sighs)
is it true this was the
greatest week in attu history?
yeah. but the birds
are still here.
unless there's a freak blizzard,
you'll still get to see them.
sorry about
the freak blizzard.
i shouldn't have said there's
gonna be a freak blizzard.
that jinxed it.
(all laughing)
no, that's the thing.
we couldn't figure it out.
what's a bird who only eats mosquitoes
doing in wisconsin in february?
then we found it.
on the porch.
bug zapper.
with a 12-month supply of
freeze-dried mosquitoes in its tray.
(all laughing)
that little sucker
was in heaven.
how about the most tropical
bird you've seen this year?
(sighs) western spindalis,
key west.
hardest to find.
rufous-capped warbler.
perched on a toilet brush
in a cabin near el paso.
(all laughing)
i almost wish
i didn't see that one.
one that got away.
(sighs) that's easy.
snowy owl.
i just can't seem
to nail that sucker!
i've been out six times this year
and i still haven't gotten one.
six trips to see one bird.
that sounds an awful lot
like a man doing a big year.
it takes one to know
one, right, stu?
cheers. of course, then again,
maybe i just love to bird.
what do you got?
bald eagle.
big deal!
we all got one five months ago.
it's got
a lady friend.
<i>narrator: of all courtship
rituals, none is as spectacular</i>
<i>as that of the bald eagle.</i>
<i>a male and female climb

yeah, i kind of miss jess.
(sighs)
(clicks tongue)
oh, hey.
oh! it's the man
with the golden ear.
yep. i thought you were
just lucky last time,
but word has it
around the barracks
that you're something
of an idiot savant.
without the "idiot" part.
no, no, that's...
i'm an idiot.
it's true.
okay, let me see if i
can try to stump you.
okay.
(howling softly)
greater roadrunner.
yep. not bad. okay.
(clears throat)
(shrill screech)
come on. easy.
common raven.
let's take it
to the next level.
okay. all right,
you asked for it.
(whistling)
oh, yeah.
audubon oriole?
oh, yeah, wow.
that, in my opinion,
is the most beautiful girl...
bird in the world.
(snickers)
is it true that you have
a life list of 578 birds?
yeah! yeah.
my mom thinks that my obsession
with birds is ruining my life.
(sighs) tell me about it.
my dad even blames the
birds for my wife leaving.
but what does he know?
i mean, that's not why.
we had other issues. but...
it was the birds.
it was the birds.
hey. how did it go?
(exclaims dismissively)
it kind of bogged down when i got
to talking about my ex-wife.
i know, i know!
stu: that's about the top of the list
of the fifty worst pickup lines.
brad: yeah.
"hi. i'm divorced.
"didn't go so good, but i got a
good feeling about this one."
oh, boy.
ew! what is that smell?
the good doctors are whipping up
a homemade batch of bird bait.
we've been fermenting it
out back since we got here.
it's like crack cocaine
to the gulls.
what are you doing?
this is my scarf!
oh, sorry.
this scarf is
from bergdorf's!
this scarf cost $250!
i wouldn't go out there if i...
shut up!
look at my scarf!
this should be fun.
(squawking)
(screaming) on, no! no!
get away!
honey? throw it away!
go...
get away!
don't take my scarf!
give it back to me!
(all exclaim)
hitchcockian.
what's he doing up there?
how many do you think
he has?
i wouldn't guess.
but you know what?
that's not the point.
we can't take our
eyes off the ball.
you think he lets
anything slow him down?
i made work my priority
and i missed the boat.
you got your feelings hurt
and you almost quit!
no more, brad.
think like him,
act like him.
one of us
has to beat this sob!
yeah. yeah!
and here's what
you do about ellie!
i don't think i'm ready.
tell her you want to
exchange phone numbers
in case there's a rare
sighting this summer.
i said i'm not ready!
but that is
a really good idea.
thanks.
good luck, stu.
whoo!

how's your

(sighs) i don't want to jinx it,

i saw a flamingo in the
everglades last week.
wow!
got about a thousand mosquito
bites, but it was worth it.
doing a big year

i really admire that, brad.
you know what i admire?
that you're not doing a big year.
why?
because it's pure!
it's all about
the love of birds for you.
how do you know i'm
not doing a big year?
(both exclaiming)
you left it there?
you're brave.
but darren's driving.
nice. darren?

ah!
darren, this is brad.
welcome to boston, bro.
so, ellie tells me you guys
are going to look for a...
what is it,
a pink goose?
no, it's not...
nope. not a pink goose.
no such thing
as a pink goose.
it's a pink-footed goose,
<i>so...</i>
if i came to see a pink goose,
then i guess this whole trip
would have been a big waste

"pink goose."
maybe there's a purple
swan out there, too.
let's go!

the pink-footed goose
had already skipped town.
<i>stu:

and no bostick.
narba says the blue-footed
booby's still on the island.

the last ferry.

you know
the beauty of it?
he never lied to us.
he never even spoke to us.
the man's a genius.
he's a machine.
he's a birding machine.

bluffing, too.
or cheating.
maybe he just
wants it more.

there is no way he
wants it more than me!
remember when you said one
of us has to beat this sob?
maybe we should...
team up.
<i>(i like birds playing)</i>
team up!
<i>(singing) i can't look
at the rocket launch</i>
<i>the trophy wives
of the astronauts</i>
<i>and i won't listen
to their words</i>
<i>'cause i like</i>
<i>birds</i>
<i>i don't care
for walking downtown</i>
<i>crazy autocar
gonna mow me down</i>
<i>look at all the people
like cows in a herd</i>
<i>well, i like</i>
<i>birds</i>
i'm exhausted.
i couldn't take another step.
(bird calling)
sandhill crane!
oh, shit!
(groans)
<i>stu: you took him up?</i>
okay. thanks, gil.
bostick saw snowcocks.
(sighs) i can't
afford snowcocks!
snowcocks are on me.
i can't even
afford this beer.
that's on me, too.
you ever been
in a helicopter?
ah!
so, how long until we see
some himalayan snowcocks?
you never know.
it's a matter of luck.
do we have to fly this
close to the mountains?
close? this isn't close.
you want to see close?
no. no, no, no, no, no!
(exclaiming)
whoa!
(laughing)
all right,
there, there, there!
himalayan just cleared the ridge!
you see it?
no!
no!
oh, man! come on, look!
(stu and brad exclaim)
(both screaming)
where are you?
come on.
there! there, there!
there, you see it?
right there!
(laughing excitedly)
stu: ride 'em, cowboy!
uh-oh!
ah!
oh, god!
gil: we're good.
we're good.
can we go home now?
don't you want
to get it on film?
hell, no!
no! no! home!
(stu and brad
exclaiming excitedly)
hey!
we're alive!
we saw snowcocks!
hey!
we're on a roll!
nothing can stop us now!
<i>ringtone: a-well-a, everybody's
heard about the bird</i>
<i>bird, bird, bird,
b-bird.</i> . .
hey, mom.
what?
it's all right.
it's okay.
so how many of these damn
tests are these clowns
gonna put me through before they
let me get the hell out of here?
dad, you had
a heart attack.
i had a minor heart attack,
all right?
in my old man's day, it was not
something you went to the hospital for.
(sighs)
let me show you
some shots from the trip.
my little hobby.
you should take a look.
what do we got here?
there we go.
colima warbler.
that's texas.
had to hike eight miles
to see that guy.
that's a spruce grouse.
maine. that was butt-cold.
(chuckles)
another spruce grouse.
there's my favorite bird.
american golden plover.
that's your favorite bird.
it's gray.
yes, it is.
well, gray-brown.
yeah, a lot of people wouldn't
think twice to look at this bird,
but this golden plover's one of the
greatest travelers in the world.
it's true. it breeds
in the arctic tundra,
then flies all the way
down to argentina
and back,
all in one year.
it shows up on beaches
of guatemala.
on farms in illinois.
nine inches long,
but he travels hundreds of thousands
of miles in his lifetime.
no passports, no security.
total freedom.
yeah. this gray bird has
seen some amazing things.
and that's the bird that
everybody underestimates.
(hooting)
(bird hooting in response)
yes!
hey. did you see a f lammer?
i heard it.
he just answered my call.
which direction?
it doesn't matter.
we both heard it.
that counts.
how do i know
what i heard?
maybe i just heard you.
maybe i heard some sob answering you.
ted: i'm claiming it.
i mean, you heard what i heard.
you should claim it, too.
just tell me
which direction, pal.
it's over here.
hey, hold up.
i'll go with you.
hey, stu.
yeah, walk with me.
(mimics bird hooting)
that was some trick you pulled
on us at anacortes ferry.
what trick? (hoots)
bostick, you're
a hard guy to figure.
seems like you'd do anything to
win, but that's not true, is it?
i work the angles
just like everyone does.
maybe even better.
yeah, but when it comes
to the honor system,
you're as pure as snow.
everyone in the clubhouse knows
which guy cheats on his score.
he's kind of pathetic.
who'd want to be that asshole, right?
bostick, this is
strange to say,
but i actually
kind of like you.
i kind of like you,
too, stu.
yeah, you seem like a...
you seem like a genuinely nice guy.
course, wasn't that
how you got to brad?
i didn't get to...
yell if you find a f lammer.
bostick!
nurse: i see that you're going to come
back at least a couple more times
so just fill out those forms
and we'll see you again.
okay, great.
thank you.
okay. we're all set.
but we do need your
husband here very soon.
he'll be here.
sorry.
am i hurting you?
oh, not at all.
your husband does know
today's the day?
oh, yeah.
yeah.
how you doing?
good. how are you, sir?
(exhales) tired.
(car honking)
the doctor's ready.
should we maybe call your husband?
can we give him
five more minutes?
okay.
bostick!
(cell phone ringing)
yeah. bostick, guess
what i'm looking at.
snowy owl.
<i>catch the 4:30 to buffalo and you
will obliterate your own record.</i>
hold on.
kenny, where are you?
jess, you cannot believe how hard
i have tried today to get there.
it's just been a complete
nightmare here in chicago.
hold on.
they've got like
all the planes grounded,
or something,
i don't know why...
(jessica screaming
in frustration)
(sighs)
here you go, mrs. b.
sounds like you could
use a cup of tea.
thanks, frankie.
yeah.
<i>ringtone: a-well-a, everybody's

brad: dad,
can you grab that for me?
<i>a-well-a, bird, bird,

<i>a-well-a, bird, bird...</i>
yeah, yeah, hello.
oh, hi.
i'm trying to reach brad?
brad's upstairs.
he's setting up an oxygen
tank for some old man.
<i>oh, can you tell him
his friend stu called?</i>
i got word of a great gray owl in the
george washington national forest,
and since that's
in your neck of the woods...
yeah, brad's told me
a lot about you, stu.
<i>same here.</i>
quite a son
you have there.
between you and me, he might break
the world's record this year.
world record?
is that right?
here, get your coat on.
where are we going?
some kind of an owl out in the woods.
i want to get a look at him.
(mouthing) an owl?
raymond: i always thought it
was kind of weird with birds.
the male is way colorful and fancy,
and the female is just plain.
the opposite from us,
you know?
i don't know, dad.
you should check out the
family photo album sometime.
those jackets you were sporting
back in the '70s were...
my sport jacket?
...pretty colorful.
paisley polyester, huh?
(laughing) yeah.
how do you think i got
your mother, eh? huh?
uh... i don't think so.
<i>jess?</i>
jessica: frankie?
is that you?
no.
it's not what you think.
what do i think?
you know what? the faluccis
are taking me to a jets game.
they wanted to get
an early start.
and when i heard you come in,
i figured i'd overslept,
'cause it's not like you've been here
any morning in the last 10 months.
so you haven't
slept with him.
no. i'd never
do that to you.
you know, fallen in
love or something?
no.
'cause, believe it or not,
i'm still in love with you.
but i can't be
married to you any more.
jess...
i'm gonna call frank
and tell him that
the game's a no go.
(brad mimics bird hooting)
(raymond breathing heavily)
you okay?
i'm fine.
go ahead. go ahead.
brad!
all right, i want you to get
that bird before it gets dark.
we will.
no. no, no.
you go on without me.
but...
i'll be fine, okay?
fine. give me the tank.
come on, come on.
give me the tank.
all right.
go get that bird.
go ahead. go!
all right.
go on!
look, you have every reason to be
really upset about the baby thing.
yeah. yeah.
that was terrible.
i know. i think in the heat of
the moment, i just plain choked,
but you got to give
someone a second chance.
no. how can you say
you love me and not
be willing to try...
because, kenny, it's a good thing
that i wasn't married
to gandhi or mozart.
'cause i just need to be with
a guy who'd rather be with me
than with anything else.
jess, you are. really.
sure. as long as there's no
egret or owl or pelican or...
no, come on!
give me a break, jess!
hold it! that's this year, then it's over!
it's every year, kenny.
no!
i know you.
i know that right now
you're in pain,
trying to think how you're gonna
get on your flight to phoenix
without looking like a jerk. no.
no. no, i'm really in pain
because i really love you, and i'm
scrambling to make this work.
enough not to
go to arizona?
i have to go to arizona.
why? why?
because right now there's
a guy out there named stu
with 730-plus birds, and
if i don't get out there,
people could say he's the
greatest birder of all time.
and he's not.
this is what i'm great at!
this is what i'll be remembered for!
no one remembers
who comes in second.
i know. i know.
(mimics bird hooting)
what are you doing?
you idiot, how could you
just leave him there?
god dang it!
(panting)
<i>narrator: of all earth's creatures,

it's me.
there's a pacific storm coming in.
<i>a big one! this could turn

(both laughing excitedly)
huh? what?
is today...
i don't believe it!
brad:
how could you not know?
didn't your wife mention
it was thanksgiving?
she doesn't like to rub it in
when the holidays roll around
and she knows i'm in a motel somewhere,
sitting around in my boxers.
same thing happened
last fourth of july.
okay, fourth of july is one
thing, but thanksgiving!
make the next left.
hey, mr. computer genius guy, don't
you have a calendar on that thing?
didn't your folks tell you?
all my dad talks about
is that damn owl.
remind me to come over
to your house on christmas.
we're trying to catch bostick,
and you're our only...
were you gonna say "hope"?
that pig's doing
another big year?
<i>brad: it was epic!
four siberian species,</i>
<i>two from china
and one from japan!</i>
all right,
so what's your total?
whoo!
a new record.
i'm gonna kick his ass.
<i>brad: "bostick didn't have
his usual cocky air.</i>
<i>"he was intense,
tired, all-business.</i>
<i>"frankly, he looked like a guy
who was trying to catch up. "</i>
so what do you think?
he's heard it through the grapevine
that annie took us out on thanksgiving.
annie made sure of that.
so, yeah, maybe he's scared.
on the other hand, maybe he's
shooting for some ridiculous number
and won't slow down
till he gets there.
what's a ridiculous number?
i mean, the guy is crazy!
<i>silent night</i>
<i>holy night</i>
<i>all is calm</i>
here. try fork.
okay, thank you. thanks.
hey. you want to...
you guys want to come sit with me?
i feel bad you're working on christmas.
come on.
waiter: why you here?
why not with family?
<i>(0 come all ye faithful

snowy owl, chan.
been up and down the sax
zim bog looking for him.
it's the only breeding bird in
north america that's eluded me.

i'd like to see the
birds of china one day.
you know anything
about that?
peking duck.
(kenny laughs)
merry christmas eve.
merry christmas.

hey, barry.
happy holidays.
you and jenny in saint
barths again this year?
not exactly. we all had
to cancel our vacations.
looks like we've
been out-shriked.
what? barry: <i>we're
being bought by 3m.</i>
<i>jim: yeah,
here's the thing, stu.</i>
you may want to
sit down for this.

is stepping down as ceo
and they want you
to take over.
<i>barry: stu, you started
this company in your garage.</i>
<i>you made it
something big.</i>
<i>now you have the chance to run one of

<i>jim: it's what they
call a lot of money.</i>
<i>but more than that, obviously, your
big year, it's coming to a close.</i>
<i>do you really want
to face the abyss?</i>
the answer is yes, jim.
jim: <i>yes, you'll do it?</i>
yes, i want to
face the abyss.
no! stu. stu. no, no, no, no!
don't say that!
don't say something
you don't mean.
but i do mean it.
i really do.
i think we need to come there and
show you this offer face-to-face.
absolutely!
can't do it, guys.
got to help a friend find a bird.
those freaking birds!
brad: hey, when are you gonna
tell me what we're chasing?
we're going on
a wild goose chase!
a goose with
little pink feet.
you're crazy!
have you noticed the snow?
that goose is in
scotland by now.
you would think so,
wouldn't you?
but my friend jeff shaw swears
he saw it up here yesterday.
just out of curiosity,
what's jeff shaw smoking?
'cause i'd like to
get me some of that!
(bird squawks)
wait! wait!
did you hear that?
pink-footed goose.
i heard it!

warm place to spend the winter.

and you're second?
and? you're third?
fourth. what can i say?
i waited
too long to do it.
<i>no, you didn't.

some other year.

we won, stu!
i don't know how else to put it.
