if i can only
savor this one...
you could if you want.

you see, the plastic's 5--
is 5 pence,
so if you put the 3
to the 5, you lose

you gotta put the 5's
and the 3's separate.
so remember,
the glass is 5.

absolutely brilliant lads.
yeah.
crackers.
they are crackers.
yeah, they've been
shouted at today.
oh, right.
yeah, 'cause they
came back with a mask
and a knife.
so i was a bit upset,
to be honest.
it was blunt.
i know, but it's a bit
irresponsible, isn't it?
i was really worried.
you're a good mother.
yeah.
yeah, i am
a good mother.
good one, then.
sorry. can i ask your
name again?
my name's richard.
and...just tell him

i'm waiting for you lot.
how you doing, lads?
all right.
you gonna go upstairs and play
on your computer before tea?
okay.
there's no one up there.
no, that's 'cause
he's been here.

he's been here?
no, as soon as you left,
he came.
what? been inside?
no, he didn't come inside.
he was fine.
he wasn't--he wasn't...
it was a bit weird.
what'd he say?
he said, "tell him
richard called."
and you don't know him?
no, i've never seen him
before in me life.
never.
but he did ask for you.
he said, uh,
"he used to knock about with
his brother years ago: anthony."
leave him alone.
what?
hey, soft, man.
what is it, babe?
what's wrong?
i do know him.
get off! get off!
i know who he is.
anthony.
he was just a kid,
just a...young lad.
i mean, he was a simple kid.
he wasn't...
do you know what i mean?
he wasn't as--
he was just...
too simple to know
what he was doing.
until rich
went in the army.
and anthony used
to hang about with us, like...
we just had a laugh with him,
we had a laugh with him.
but sonny was just...
just everything.
everything was too far.
everything he took too far.
and anthony just didn't know
what was happening.
he didn't know where he was.
he was-- he wasn't like--
he just didn't
understand at all.
he just--just...
he didn't understand
any of it.
we...
all got in a van and...
we were dropping acid and...
and sonny gave him some...
and i could see
it was going wrong.
i could see-- i could see
anthony's face,
and it was all...
he was tripping
out of his mind, this kid.
<i>Å?</i>
you're all right, mate.
he don't mind me.
fall in!
<i>Å?</i>
aah!
<i>Å?</i>
no! no!
<i>Å?</i>
aah!
anthony, stop shouting.
because every time you shout,
your mother gets sick.
and then richard might
get a bullet in the army.
and we don't
want that, do we?
move from there,
you're dead.
don't fuckin' move!
come on!
get a move on!
i was the last one--
i could have stayed.
i could have stayed.
i could have kept with him.
but everybody got
back in the van.
left him.
i didn't want to leave him.
<i>Å?</i>
we found him.
he's killed himself.
he's done himself.
<i>Å?</i>
get up.
don't make a noise.
get up.
where are your
car keys?
if you make a noise,
i'll push this
in your spine.
get in.
here.
do you remember me?
yeah.
why have i brought you here?
this is where
anthony was--
was?
when he what?
come on, have the bollocks
to say it.
where he hung himself.
why him?
'cause he was weak.
'cause he was a spastic.
he wasn't a spastic.
he fuckin' was a spastic.
he was a fuckin' nana.
he looked up to you.
well, he was a fuckin'
embarrassment to me.
what did you do to him?
what did you do?
we were--
i said you!
what did you fuckin' do?
not them cunts.
i didn't stop it.
i didn't stop it.
well, i wish you had...
'cause you could have stopped
a lot of carnage.
what do you mean?
they're all fuckin' dead.
i executed them.
and you're the last one.
now i'm the monster.
was he calling for me?
when you were torturing him,
was he calling for me?
yeah.
was he screaming my name?
yeah, he was.
he still is.
i love you, anthony.
i love you, kid,
but i can't do him.
i can't do him.
i'm sorry.

knife from me,
i'm gonna do something
awful with it.

other way to end it.
