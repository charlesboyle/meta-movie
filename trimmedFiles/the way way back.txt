duncan?
duncan, are you sleeping?
<font color="#808080">duncan :</font> no.
let me ask you something.
on a scale of one to ten,
what do you think you are?
duncan? i'm asking you
how you see yourself.
scale of one to ten.
<font color="#808080">duncan :</font> i don't know.
i can't hear you, bud.
you have to speak up.
i don't know.
what? what don't you know?
how you see yourself?
you don't
have any opinion?
i'm just asking.
pick any number'
scale of one to ten.
just shout it out.
say a number.
a six.
a what?
a six!
i think you're a three.
you know why
i think you're a three?
do you know what would
make me say that?
no.
you don't know?
you have no idea?
no.
you've got to speak up,
buddy.
no!
since i've been
dating your mom,
i don't see you putting
yourself out there, bud.
meeting kids your own age.
and from what
your mom tells me,
you just seem content
to hang around her apartment.
is that a fair assessment? you're
just happy to not do anything?
because, damn,
to me that is a three.
but, the good news
i'm here to tell you,
since there's going
to be plenty of kids
and plenty of
opportunities for you
to take advantage of at my
beach house this summer.
it's a big summer
for all of us, really.
you, your mom. me, steph.
one day,
we could become a family.
so, what do you say'? let's try
to get that score up. huh'?
aim higher than a three?
that sound good?
you up for that, buddy'?

car my dad used to drive us in.
old and crappy.

much i've spent on this car?
this is cherry.
this is a cherry car.

with bad taste.
shocker.
hi. i'm betty.
hi, pam.
trent's probably already
talked crap about me.
no.
he did, didn't he?
it's okay if he has.
what did he say?
i'm loving this.
oh, thank you.
i couldn't pull it off.
my hair seems to hate me.
that's where you're supposed
to say, "your hair's lovely."
oh, it, is.
it is lovely.

who is this in all
his awkward stage glory?
<font color="#808080">pam :</font> this is my son, duncan.
everybody lends a hand.
oh, my god. i was going to
name my youngest duncan,
but my ex-husband thought
it was too nerdy.
so, we went with peter. which,
personally, i think is worse.
but, it suits my son, so...
oh, don't worry,
you wear the name well.
trent, where's staph?
we've been here
all of two minutes,
so i suppose she's getting
ready for the beach.
oh, my god. she's just like me.
screw cancer.
i want to be an even golden brown.
everywhere.
everybody's back this year.
the gales. the hutchisons.
the campbells, sans ben

insider trading.
the smythes. oh, and the
keegans, who i'm not talking to.
you can if you want to, but just
know that most of us aren't.
<i>okay.</i>
so, do you think you will'?
pam?
do i think i will,
what?
talk to the keegans.
oh, i don't know.
i don't even know them.
do if you want to but just
know that i'm mad at them.
i don't even want
to get into why.
they called me
a see-you-next-tuesday.
to my face.
you're going to love it here!
whoa!
i've only had one.
yee-haw!
so, how was your winter?
because our year
was a challenge.
my niece was raped
in october.
oh, my god!
i know.
not even food courts are safe
oh, and bob,
that's my ex-husband.
finally came out of
the closet. not a shock.
let's just say that, in bed,
his favorite view was
the back of my head.
my oldest, charlie, is still into
the drugs and psychedelic music.
drugs i get. but, come on, gary
garcia's dead! get over it.
gary?
don't do drugs, declan.
duncan.
oh, and susanna. you saw her.
she's a walking mood.
she's going through
an "i hate my mother" phase.
taking her father's side,
as usual.
hi, mrs. thompson.
oh, steph,
don't you look so cute.
that's exactly
the kind of suit that
got me pregnant
the first time.
that's what
i'm hoping for.
hey.
i'm kidding!
oh, and peter. finally got his
surgery to fix his lazy eye.
now, ifs even worse.
i try to get him to
wear an eye patch,
so people don't feel awkward.
but, what are you gonna do?
i'm outta here.
oh, why don't you
take duncan with you?
screw that. i told you i'm not
baby-sitting him all summer.
<font color="#808080">trent :</font> you're gonna take duncan

are you coming or what?
<font color="#d900d9">(sighs)</font>

and, just don't die. i don't need
that shit hanging over my head.
<i><font color="#808080">steph :</font> we can absolutely
party at my place.</i>
my dad only gets to see me,
like, twice a year,
so he totally just
wants me to be happy.
that's exactly the type of
parent i'm going to be.
i'm gonna do drugs
with my kids.
oh, my god. i forgot.
willem broke up with jessica!
<font color="#d900d9">(gasps)</font> no!

oh.
just stare at the bridge of his nose.
that's what i do.
mom.
are you shitting me?
if you wore the patch,
i wouldn't have to keep
telling people that, would i?
duncan, i thought you and peter
should hang out this summer.
lord knows he brought enough
of his star wars dolls.
they're action figures!
and they're classics!
please.
they lose value if i take
them out of the box.
but we can still have
awesome battles with them.
he needs human contact
he's having far too many
conversations with those dolls.
no, i'm not!
should we set up a time for you
two to get together tomorrow?
um...
i should check with my mom.
oh. okay.
don't stand us up.
we know where you live!
<font color="#d900d9">(laughs)</font>
i told you. your eye makes
people uncomfortable.
you're the worst parent.

to say that'?

that i get greedy.

it's still my quarter.

score, i don't want to see...
what's your name?
duncan.
i don't want to see
that up on the screen.
oh, they only let
you use three letters.

there you are. we were just
about to leave without you.
where did you go off to?
nowhere.
let's leave notes, okay?
your mom was worried.
you need to get
your swim trunks on.
kip and joan have invited
us out on their boat.
we're gonna be late.
<i><font color="#808080">trent :</font> head's up, buddy.</i>
you need to wear that.
i think he's gonna be
all right without that.
no, duncan can't swim.
trent, he's just not
a comfortable swimmer.
i really think he's
gonna be okay without it.
no, just wear it. so people
don't have to worry about you.
<font color="#d900d9">(betty whooping)</font>
yes, we're inviting ourselves.
accept it and move on.
peter does have to
stay down below though.
his eye throws
off his equilibrium
and he will get
sick everywhere.
no, i won't, mom!
tell that to the bucket
we have to bring!
mom, why do i have to wear this'?
nobody else does.
he just wants you to be safe.
is that snug enough?
you know what?
we take our shoes off.
oh, god. sorry.
<font color="#808080">betty :</font> tell me this is
gonna clear, trent.
it's gonna clear.
my titties need
some color.
<i><font color="#808080">pam :</font> basically,
he was relentless.</i>
and don't get me wrong.
i was looking.
i had been divorced
for well over a year.
it just took a little
persistence on my end.
i wasn't sure about you.
i met her when
she was catering
some halloween party
in albany.
he went as a sexy cop.
oh, god!
no. i went as a '70s,
badass cop.
oh, he followed me
around all night,
saying that he was there
to "protect and serve" me.
that about ended it
right there for me.
sadly, i would have been
working his bag at that point.
however,
i do remember.
you did let me help you pack your
van at the end of the night.
yes, i did.
yes, you did.
then it took three months
to get her to go outwith me.
three months?
i did not know
you had that kind of stamina.
she definitely
made me work for it.
but it was worth it.
there may be
hope for you yet.
what finally
changed your mind?
he said we were
already in this together,
<i>so i might as well.</i>
it's been almost a year.
yeah.
duncan.

he wants this to work.
he wants us to be a family.
yeah, he says that, but
that's not what he does.

but you promised, remember?
you'd give it a try.
i don't understand why i can't

some kid threw up
near crazy tubes.
sexy. let's try not to impress
him all at once. huh?
that will not be a challenge.
lewis is kind of
over this place.
i told you.
i'm not long for here.
no,
i remember that conversation.
in 2003, 5, 11, april.
yesterday.
can't eat that now.
your dirty mouth's been on it.
germophobe.
i've just told you.
there are things i want to do.
prove it. without thinking
rattle off three. go!
see new mexico.
invent something.
become a storm chaser.
you had me
until number three.
i think you have to
go to school for that.
"look. there's a storm."
"where?" "over there." "cool."
"let's go get it." "got it."
he actually is.
he's been studying meteorology
since pre-school.
don't let the dahmer
glasses fool you.
these don't have any mesh,
so you're going commando.
watch sitting.
your junk will fall out.
found that out the hard way
at a birthday party.
and like that you're impressed.
and grossed out.
bye lewis.
bye.
water wizz waterpark.
built in the summer of '83,
it's the last bastion of everything
that time period stood for.
in fact, it was decreed
by its creator
that this place
shall never age.
on his deathbed, he said,
"i don't want this place
re-painted or updated.
"i don't even want
it brought up to code.
"and the minute someone tries,
it needs to be destroyed."
we actually have a nuclear
bomb forjust such an occasion.
bought it off the russians.
really? still good with all that?
even the russian thing?
that's cold war.
it's kind of dated.
all right,
that was a waste of a bit.
hey.
some kid threw up
near crazy tubes.
what? why is this the first i'm
hearing of this? damn it, woman!
caitlin, duncan.
tony, mary beth.
hi, duncan. also, i need
you to reorder more mats.
did it.
finish the work schedule
for next week.
did it.
change all the filters.
done.
you know, i'm going to check
all that stuff, right?
then, in that case,
i didn't do any of that.
so, i'm doing it.
it's called delegation. i read
about it in a book about it.
that's the one
you wait for, my man.
oh, yeah.
she looked back.
she likes me.
this is devil's peak. the largest
waterslide in a 50-mile radius.
stretch out the tube, end to end.
don't google that
for confirmation.
that fact
predates technology.
owen,
settle a debate for us.
hello, boys. duncan, this is
vladimir, ishmael, and ming lee.
those aren't our names!
those are the names
i'm giving you, vlady.
these are my illegitimate sons.
they all have different mothers.
i'm trying to be a positive
influence in their lives.
take them to little league, boys
club, raising pandas to fight.
shut up, jackass!

neil says that years ago
some kid figured out
how to pass someone on the water slide.
is that true?
he did!
it's physically impossible,
neil!
you can't catch up to
someone and pass them!
actually, ming lee's right.
i was here when it happened.
all right,
then how'd he do it?
it happened inside the tube.
so, no one really knows.
only the kid and
the person he passed.
and jesus christ, our lord. but,
he's a little hard to get a hold of.
he won't return my calls.
we wore the same shirt to a party
and it got a little weird.
be serious!
don't interrupt him, neil!
he's talking!
guys, what happens in the tube
stays in the tube.
that's just the law
of the park.
bullshit. we'll just ask
the kid how he did it.
be my guest
if you can find him.
last i heard he went
into a deep depression.
the fame was too much.
he turned to cocaine
to escape the limelight.
and eventually,
a life of male prostitution.
you look good.
good for you!
screw you, owen!
yeah, screw you, owen.
i just said that, neil!
i'm being supportive!
actually, that crack-addled
male whore was me.
really?
wow!
do you get comedy?
so, did he pass him by sliding
up the side of the tube?
i'm not telling you.
but i want to know!
that's a good thing.
don't die wondering.
all right, hot rod,
what's happening?
some kid threw up
near crazy tubes.
wow!
pointless news travels fast.
can i get a special ride "with
benefits" for my man, duncan?
yeah, hold on.
this slide's
out of order.
watch this.
yeah,
you gotta use the other one.
actually, you know what? i think
it's back in order. okay.
come on, step up, please.
okay. hold on.
just hold there for a sec.
hold.
this guy's an artist.
watch and learn.
and you are holding.
still holding.
all right, i think we're all set
to hold a little bit longer.
okay, step back a little bit.
okay, step forward.
okay, stay there.
step back. and hold.
<i>okay.</i>
look at him.
it's gorgeous.
just about ready to hold.
okay and go.
okay, go, go, go!

throw your bike in the back.
no. you don't have to.
come on.
yeah?
yeah.
no, it's too much trouble.
duncan we've got to start
having faster conversations.
throw your bike in the back.
i'd help you out but i got
my hands on the wheel.
giving you a ride.
i think that's enough.
where'd you get that?

hey, easy, easy!
the car's just
the right amount of shitty.
<font color="#d900d9">(rock music playing)</font>
so, what brought you
to the water park?
not many kids head our way when
the ocean's their backyard.
i don't know. i guess there's
not much for me at home.
how long have you
been working there?
oh! the park?
i've always been there.
ever since i was
a small cambodian child.
of course, that was after 'nam.
i was in the shit.
then i joined the circus
to become a clown fighter.
i know about 46 ways to kill a clown.
i hate clowns.
i'm kidding except for the part
where i really do hate them.
<font color="#d900d9">(groaning)</font>
nice teamwork.
i'm exhausted.
thanks for the ride.
hey, thanks for the memories.
hey, evel knievel.
you're probably busy
or not interested,
but i need somebody
to be a floater at the park.
you know, do some odd jobs,
clean up some vomit.
what do you think?
definitely.
awesome. yeah.
if it's too much trouble, you
totally don't have to, but...
if you need someone...
duncan.
yes.
there you go.
tomorrow. 9:00 a.m.
who was that you were with?
just a friend.
a friend who drives?
mom.
what's his name?
owen.
and how do you know him?
mom, he's just a friend.
a friend with a license?
well, you should
bring him by.
okay? i'd like to meet him.
fine.
whoa. i'm not done.
we don't stay out all night
and disappear all day.
do you understand me?
i could say
the same to you.
what?
i want you to make an
appearance at betty's.

<font color="#808080">peter :</font> what?
there you go.
do you want me
to make you a plate of food?
no, i can do it.
be sure to get some clams. they
were all my doing this year.

you want to go
chase ghost crabs?
oh, hell, yeah!
duncan?
any interest?
yeah. sure.
when i was younger,
my dad used to bring me down
here to do this all the time.
he'd fill my head with all these
useless facts about ghost crabs.
like, did you know
they're omnivorous?
basically, they eat
both animals and vegetables.
my mom jokes,
"leave it to your dad
"to be interested in a
creature that goes both ways."
so, do you want me
to keep talking
or are you going to
say something eventually?
my mom doesn't smoke pot.
that's the power
of this place.
it's like spring
break for adults.
that's what i think
really kills my mom.
not that my dad left,
but that he's got
someone and she doesn't.
so, is your dad
seeing anybody?
yeah, she's a lot younger.
classic.
they're just getting
situated in san diego.

<font color="#808080">kip :</font> joan found
herself a victim, huh?
kip, i expect to be inviting
myself on your boat again.
and when should i
plan on doing that?
i would like nothing more than to
get you on my boat in a bikini.
<font color="#d900d9">(both laughing)</font>
but the motor's out.
<font color="#808080">betty :</font> what?
<font color="#808080">kip :</font> yeah, the motors out
and its' been out for a week.
and it's gonna be another week
until i get the parts.
<font color="#808080">betty :</font> well,
that doesn't fit my schedule.
uh...
i'm just...
how much more
do you need?
do something, mom!
you know what's happening.
he's sleeping with her.
do something about it!
duncan.
yeah, that's it!
walk away!
it's easier!
it's right in front
of your face, mom!
let go of me!
i'm not talking to you.
well,
i'm talking to you.
just go screw her, asshole!
you already have!
she's certainly not going to do
anything about it. are you, mom?
you don't know what
you're talking about.
everybody knows
what i'm talking about!
really?
both of you!
stop it! duncan!
fine!
you don't want to do anything about it'?
it's your life.
it's not mine.
i want to be
with dad!
duncan.
your father?
good luck with that.
hey, trent, don't
he doesn't want you, kid.
is that true?
duncan...
i told you
it sucks here.
i talked to
my dad today.
i told him that we had
chased ghost crabs.
it made him very happy.
i felt like he was here.
"did you tell him about
the eyes, susanna?
"you've got to tell him
about their eyes!"
he gets so excited.
see, their eyes can
rotate 360 degrees.
they can see everything
that's around them.
but they can't
look straight up.
which makes it easy
for birds to attack them.
so they have to gather their
food at night for safety.
i don't know.
my dad finds it cool.
he's a dork.
wait.
duncan.
i'm sorry.
<font color="#808080">trent :</font>
hey, it didn't mean anything.
it was just a mistake.
a stupid mistake.
god! i'm such an asshole!
pam. listen.
you deserve better.
i know that.
i have to be better.
i have to be better.
i'm gonna be better for you.
and for duncan.
hey, what's up?
where are you going?
shut up, peter.
<font color="#808080">pam :</font> duncan?
<font color="#d900d9">(whispers)</font>

i got it.
or,
you could just use the gate.
all right, everybody, be cool.
our boss is here
with his pirate friend.
<font color="#d900d9">(rock music playing)</font>
hell, yeah.
i could use a cleansing ale.
or check them out from afar.
<font color="#808080">peter :</font> i've had a beer before.
and i've spent
a night in jail before.
but there's
a limit to everything.
who's your friend?
peter.
nice eye patch.
thanks.
you don't sound
too cool with it.
my mom makes me wear it. she
says my eye confuses people.
well now you gotta show me.
ha, ha!
look at that thing!
she wants you to hide that?
is she insane?
i'd kill to have that eye.
you're full of shit.
seriously. you know how many
bits i could do with that?
daring people to look me
straight in the eye?
<font color="#d900d9">(ensues)</font>
that thing is awesome.
you mind if i mingle?
sure. but keep your
hands in your pockets.
you look a little shady to me.
i'll circle back.
got a lot of confidence.
hey, man. what's up?
so you're having a party?
yeah, we're having
a farewell for lewis.
i think he's
serious this time.
did you want to talk to me?
no, i just wanted to hang out.
all right.
how about we say you hang out
for a little bit? okay?
i'm sure you'll
be wanted at home
at some point.
you're a popular guy.
<font color="#d900d9">(people whooping)</font>
<font color="#d900d9">(rock music playing)</font>
owen, you shouldn't have.
i went to three
different places
in the water park
to find that.
you can use it to
catch thunderclouds.
turn the music down.
we need to hear a few parting
words from our guest of honor.
oh, no.
yes.
no thank you.
i don't want to open
myself up to some bit.
you want to be
part of a tradition?
there's no bit here.
we're going to miss you.
plain and simple.
i'm gonna have
to sit for this.
no. you don't know
where this has been.
um...
well, i won't say that i won't
miss some aspects of this place.
it wasn't completely
void of decent times.
i remember a couple of clays
that were almost memorable.
i guess if there's one thing
i will miss dearly, it's...
oh, my god!
what the hell, man?
it's part of our tradition.
what kind of warped
tradition is that?
lewis was pouring
his heart out!
i was going to say people.
i'll miss the people.
<font color="#808080">owen :</font> oh, my god!
not you, roddy!
seriously! my doctor said
not to get water on my face!
oh, my god!
the only thing that
could make this worse
is if there were
more squirt guns.
and there are!

i'm sorry. i'm developmentally
challenged. like bad.
nightmarey, special
episode bad. i'm sorry.
it's all right. i was...
i was a little frustrated.
i just planned on being here one
summer, and now it's three years.
it had a lot to do with you.
i just don't want to
look back and regret
that it should have
only been one summer.
you won't
you were right.
we do sell coffee.
<font color="#d900d9">(sighs)</font>
i said you could hang
out for a little bit
but sunrise of the next day is
where i have to draw the line.
you gotta go home.
i wish i could
stay here forever.
you're going to love the winters.
they're pretty spectacular.
painting houses
until it gets too cold,
bar backing at some dive,
talking to inanimate objects.
i'm serious.
yeah. so am i.
there's a whole world
out there for you, duncan.
don't settle.
not yet.
i don't have
anywhere else to go.
yeah?
i bet that's not true.
this is the only place
i'm happy.
what's going on?
i hate him.
who?
trent.
my mom's boyfriend.
he said i was a three.
he asked me what i thought i was
on a scale from one to ten.
he called me a three.
who says that to somebody?
somebody who doesn't know you.
i didn't want to have to answer!
i shouldn't have to answer!
listen to me. that's about him, man.
that's all about him.
it's got nothing
to do with you.
yeah? how do you know?
'cause i know. okay?
don't worry about how i know.
my dad was the same way.
that's why i don't
like patterns and rules.
and that's why you
can't buy into that shit.
you gotta go your own way.
and you, my friend,
are going your own way.
mom, they're home!
see you.
where the hell have you
been all night, young man!
not now,
woman.
what did you
say to me?
we'll talk when i get up.
all right?
<font color="#808080">betty :</font> who are you talking to, buddy?
don't you walk away from me!
pam, he's here.
where's your eye patch?
<font color="#808080">peter :</font> lost it!
<font color="#d900d9">(yelling continues)</font>
we were worried
about you, buddy.
listen. let's just forget about last night.
all right?
start over. a clean slate.
sound good to you, buddy?
hope
you're happy now.
what's going on?
we're leaving.
i need you to get your stuff.
mom, i'm sorry.
i know.
me too.
but, why do you and i have to go?
the summers not over.
duncan.
we can stay somewhere else.
i don't understand.
we want to leave early,
so that's what we're doing!
so, we're going with them?
i don't expect you
to understand.
you're 14.
and, i know that means you think
you know everything, but...
we do things.
we do things to
protect ourselves.
because we're...
we're scared.
we're leaving with them.
<font color="#d900d9">(music playing)</font>
all right.
we are good to go.
thank you.
i think you are great.
you are.
so, i guess.
we're leaving.

me, that's all.
