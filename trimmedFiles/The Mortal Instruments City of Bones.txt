yeah, no, i know. but when you tell me
to do something i'm going to do it.
so i'm emailing him right now.
well, i don't know how quick
he's going to get back...
'cause you know sometimes
he doesn't check. so...
yeah, and after the poetry
reading i'm not going home.
it's my birthday. so i
want to go to a club.
hm-hmm.
no, simon, i'm not
going to lie to her.
i'm just not going to tell her.
let me go park the truck.
- see you later, alright?
- okay.
hi, dorothea. how are you?
i'm good. thanks for asking.
<i>so i'll just call, i guess,</i>
<i>and get extra tickets.</i>
<i>yeah, sure, i'll do
it right now.</i>
- hey, you.
- simon.
hi, simon.
- he says: "call me".
- hm-hmm.
yeah, she just got home.
i'm sure she can hear you,
she's standing right here.
- hey, luke.
- how's it going, clary?
no, i'll get dressed quick.
do you want some coffee?
<i>if you keep talking</i>
<i>i'm going to be late.</i>
<i>i'll meet you there, bye.</i>
- did you just use the...?
- how are you feeling?
fine. why?
you make sure you come
straight home tonight.
mom, come on. it's
just a poetry reading.
i know.
bye.
you need to talk
to her, jocelyn.
she's not ready. not yet.
yes, she is. you're not.
by the way, thanks for doing this.
his poetry means a lot to him.
that's what friends are for.
<i>come...</i>
my faux juggernaut,
my nefarious loins!
slather every protuberance
with arid zeal.
agony...
agony, torment.
i can't listen to this.
you want another coffee?
yeah.
envelope like tiny crocus
petals whisper death...
- cappuccino and espresso.
- rain drowns the earth.
- hi.
- hey.
shivering breezes weave through a
morbid tapestry of festering disease.
turgid is my torment.
- there we go.
- thank you.
that blonde girl over there was
totally flirting with you.
ask her out.
- no, wouldn't be fair.
- why?
well, because i'm saving
myself for someone else.
- who? ...is my torment.
thank you. thank
you very much.
<i>i think he's getting worse. as his</i>
<i>friend, you should probably tell him.</i>
maybe his poetry is great.
we just don't know it yet.
let's go in here. i want to
ask what that symbol means.
clary, we'll never get in.
such the eternal optimist.
- this is so not like you.
- just go with it for once.
hi. what does that symbol mean?
- what symbol?
- yeah, what symbol?
it's right there.
you don't see it?
no.
that was cool.
yeah, we're fitting in.
go with it.
- clary, you want a drink?
- yeah.
<i>clary.</i> <i>clary, what is it?</i>
you didn't see that?
i know what i saw! they killed
the guy that let us in the club.
- did you drink something?
- god, no, simon!
i've heard sometimes they
pump hallucinogenic stuff...
into the air vents, to make
sure people have a good time.
okay, then, how come you're fine?
do we breathe different air?
i don't know. let's
just go home.
- you okay?
- yeah, fine.
you've been sleeping all day.
and you didn't come home
'til late last night.
yeah. well, i'm home, okay?
you can't go.
i sold another painting. i
wanted to celebrate with you.
to what, your one buyer?
who is this guy, anyway?
he probably just buys your
stuff because he's into you.
i'm sure you'll just string him
along like you do with luke.
you really want to have
that conversation?
what's that supposed to mean?
- simon.
- he's like my brother.
i doubt he feels that way.
okay, well, i'm going to go.
- no, no, you can't.
- this is ridiculous.
- where are you going?
- i'm just going to java jones.
- jesus!
- nope. just me.
- come on, simon.
- clary...
there's something i
want to tell you, okay?
- we can talk about this later.
- bye, mrs. fray.
look.
suddenly, i'm drawing hundreds of these
things and i have no idea what they are.
i don't know... i think
i'm going out of my mind.
maybe you're like the guy
in "close encounters".
everybody thought he was paranoid and
then it turned out to be, well...
...ufo... reasonable...
oh god, this isn't happening.
- what?
- this isn't happening.
okay, now you're
freaking me out.
clary... are you...?
what are you looking at?
wait here.
where's the cup, jocie?
- how did you find me?
- you can thank your daughter for that.
why can i see you and
no one else can?
i was going to ask you
the same question.
i don't even know why i'm talking to you.
you're a killer.
- a cold-blooded killer.
- as opposed to a peace-loving killer?
- i know what i saw.
- you think you know.
why am i drawing this?
so i was right.
you're not a mundane.
excuse me. what's a mundane?
someone from the human world.
if i'm not a human
then what am i?
go find the cup.
- when did this start?
- no. no.
why am i drawing this?
answer me!
simon...
maybe you should answer that.
it could be your boyfriend.
- he's not my boyfriend.
- does he know that?
please, it's annoying.
- mom, i'm coming home.
- no, you can't come home!
you understand me?
you don't come home.
you call luke. tell him valentine's
alive and that he found me.
<i>- i love you.</i>
- mom!
you tell valentine he'll
never have the cup.
don't drink! come here!
come on!
- i'm sorry. are you okay?
- you okay? alright, don't move.
mom?
mom?
come on. come on.
- that's enough!
- no!
that's enough. it's dead.
what the hell was that?
you wouldn't believe
me if i told you.
try me.
it was a demon.
you're right. i
don't believe you.
and that thing you saw me
kill at the club, that...
that was also a demon.
and demons can take possession of any living creature.
you can't trust anyone.
even people you think you know.
so why should i trust you?
i did just save your life.
dorothea, open up! please.
can you...?
<i>do you know what
happened</i> <i>to my mom?</i>
do you?
- wait. you can see this guy?
- of course she can, she's a witch.
downgraded from a gingerbread
house to a one-bedroom?
- do you know where my mom is?
- sorry. i have no idea.
well, she mentioned
a name: valentine.
- you better leave.
- no, please.
not until you tell me something.
anything.
let's see what the
cards have to say.
i'm sorry, but you know that
i don't believe in any of...
sit.
run your hands over the cards.
my mom painted these.
yes. they were a gift.
let's see which
card gets picked.
the ace of cups.
- that's the mortal cup.
- so?
ignore him.
it's a mortal instrument. one of the
three holy objects of my people.
- what's it doing here?
- i don't understand...
what any of this has
to do with my mom.
your mother was a shadowhunter.
like him.
no, my mom is a painter.
she never told you any
of this, did she?
look, all i know is
that she's gone...
and i have no idea where
to start looking for her.
let me read you.
there's something
blocking your mind.
my guess is your mother hired someone
very skilled to protect you.
- from what?
- your own memories.
why? i don't remember anything
she'd want me to forget.
wait...
nice to meet you.
what the hell?
- you scared me.
- what the hell happened here?
- my mom's missing.
- what?
someone took her and
destroyed the place.
well...
this guy is helping me find her.
but you can't see him. and he...
clary.
great. okay, now i
can't see him, either.
jace wayland. demon hunter.
simon lewis. keymaster.
are you the gatekeeper?
i have no idea what
you're talking about.
- so you can see him now?
- what?
of course i can see him.
what are you talking about?
just a sec. this
is so confusing.
who's this?
it's my dad. he died
when i was two.
clary. so, wait.
your mom is gone...
and you're hanging around with some
dyed-blond wannabe goth weirdo?
where'd you come
across this guy?
- well, i didn't... he found me.
- what? he found you.
- i know it sounds.
- check this.
and for the record, my
hair's naturally blond.
clary, clary, clary, simon?
she called you?
why didn't you pick up?
if i'd known it was serious,
i would've picked up.
well, how would you know
if you didn't pick it up?
what's that?
nothing good.
do you have any idea
where she found this?
i've got to find luke.
it's so weird, his truck's here.
this way.
no, you wait here.
who made you the boss?
it's okay. just let us
know if anyone comes.
i've known luke all these years,
but i've never been down here.
what?
<i>- come on, mate!</i>
<i>- i don't know.</i>
<i>now, listen, all you got to do,</i>
<i>mate, is tell me the truth.</i>
<i>i'm telling you,</i> <i>i don't
know where the cup is.</i>
<i>i know you and jocie are close.</i>
<i>i'm not stupid. am i?</i>
<i>don't answer that.</i>
<i>listen to me, mate, just tell
me</i> <i>where the mortal cup is.</i>
<i>and then jocie will be fine.</i> <i>lukey, tell me.
tell me the truth.</i>
<i>- i don't know.</i>
<i>- you don't want to make me angry!</i>
i'm telling you!
i'm going to ask
you again, mate.
- where's the cup?
- i don't know.
we all want the same thing,
lukey boy, don't we?
difference is, i think you
know where it is. don't you?
come on. talk!
- we need to go.
- no, please. you have to help him.
you don't understand.
they work for valentine.
he's a dead man. i
can't help him.
he's like family.
you know what's really amazing, is how
much you actually look like a human.
isn't it great?
please.
<i>well, you're going to get mad,</i>
<i>you're going to change.</i>
<i>i want to see you change.</i>
show me how you can change?
look at that.
<i>dog boy's coming on.</i>
<i>you want to hump my leg?</i>
you hump legs? you like that?
<i>you want to smell my derrière?</i>
i want to see you change!
you just got to tell me
where jocelyn hid the cup.
then you can have her back.
she'll be safe and sound.
i don't want her back.
i couldn't care less.
<i>i have spent years...</i>
<i>cozying up to that woman</i> <i>and
her brat for the mortal cup.</i>
pangborn, listen to me.
i want to be the one to
give it to valentine.
yeah, right.
you're making a big mistake.
i don't believe you.
do you believe him?
- clary, run!
- clary, listen!
excuse me... officer, i'd
like to report a break-in.
and a missing person.
my friend's house got
broken into and...
- her mom is missing.
- oh, no. run!
- you killed two cops!
- they weren't cops! let's go.
clary. you can't stay
here, they'll find you.
how could luke say
that he didn't care?
i've known him for as
long as i can remember.
he used to read to me every night. he's
been picking me up at school for years.
maybe those memories
aren't real.
do you remember what i told you?
you can't trust anyone.
i need to find my mom
and i have to go home!
there must be something
that i missed!
listen to me, okay? we'll figure
this out, but not here and not now.
we need to get you
to a safe place.
i'm a shadowhunter, clary, and i
will protect you with my life.
there you guys are. i thought
you were right behind me.
i thought i lost you.
okay, i'll follow you.
are you sure about that? because
he just killed two cops!
yeah, they weren't cops.
<i>they looked like
real cops to me.</i>
- they weren't real cops.
- okay.
so where did they get the car?
they weren't real cops.
we'll be safe in here.
what is this dump?
this isn't a dump.
you just can't see it.
what the hell is going on?
what are they doing in here?
it's a demon bite.
clary. jace, do something.
this is the part where
you start tearing off...
pieces of your shirt
to bind my wounds?
if you wanted me to take my clothes
off, you should've just asked.
she's waking up.
i passed out and you guys tattooed me?
thought that only happened in vegas.
- it's not a tattoo.
- it's a rune.
they have them for everything. they
make you invisible, strong, they heal.
they also make you visible. that's
why i can suddenly see him.
- even if you're hungry...
- no.
the fact that the rune had an effect
on you explains why you can see us.
- i don't get it.
- mundanes can't survive the process.
the runes are too
strong for them, so...
well, now we definitely know
you have shadowhunter blood.
wait. it wasn't definite before?
well, it became definite
when she didn't die, yes.
here. see if these fit. it's not
every day we get guests in here.
especially not girls.
shouldn't we call the cops?
i mean the real ones?
that's a great idea.
i don't know why we haven't thought
of that for the past thousand years.
hodge is ready for her.
he wants to see her
alone in the library.
who's hodge?
he's in charge of the institute.
okay, let's go.
hundreds of shadowhunters
used to seek asylum here.
but, as you can see, right
now we're the only ones.
without the mortal cup,
we're a dying breed.
either you're born of
the shadowhunter...
or you have to drink
from the mortal cup.
you coming?
pretty far from
brooklyn, isn't it?
stay away from jace.
you may find hodge a
little eccentric.
but he's one of the greatest
shadowhunter that's ever lived.
here, give me that.
don't you think
it's a bit risky...
inviting a complete stranger
into the heart of the institute?
no. i think we can trust her.
- and what about her mundane friend?
- well, that was impulsive.
when you're impulsive,
things go badly.
be careful. the rune to fix a broken
heart is the most painful one.
they'll be out of here in a day.
i promise.
jace.
she was one of the
best, your mum.
- but i don't understand why she...
- yesterday, you were...
just a normal girl.
today, you feel as though your whole
world has been turned upside-down.
there's only one thing
you need to know.
the stories you were
told as a little girl...
about monsters and nightmares...
legends whispered
around campfires...
they're all true.
- demon?
- yes.
demon?
no. werewolves aren't demons.
we have a truce
with downworlders.
downworlders? what is that,
people below 14th street?
well, downworlders pretty
much sums everything up.
vampires, werewolves, warlocks.
warlocks. cool.
so how do you kill a zombie?
- we don't.
- of course. they're already dead.
no. they don't exist.
so that's the famous cup
everyone's talking about.
a replica. but, yes.
you know, jace has got a
real chip on his shoulder.
you would, too, if you saw your father
murdered when you were a child.
if it weren't for
him, we'd be dead.
he saved our lives more
times than i care to admit.
right.
<i>the legend goes...</i>
the crusaders summoned an angel.
the angel raziel.
raziel poured his
blood into a cup...
and those who drank from it
became half angel, half human.
shadowhunters.
as did their children and
their children's children.
beings of immense power.
strong enough to
restore balance...
and protect the world in
a war against evil...
a war that can never be won...
but must always be fought.
demons don't die easily.
whereas we... we
remained all too mortal.
why didn't they just use the cup
to create more shadowhunters?
valentine's exact words.
the clave, the keepers of the cup,
they were afraid of using its power.
they knew that hardly anyone
who drank from it survived.
<i>valentine morgenstern drew</i> <i>a
circle of friends together...</i>
<i>young idealistic
shadowhunters...</i>
<i>to help him steal the mortal
cup</i> <i>from the clave.</i>
<i>but he didn't want to</i>
<i>protect humanity.</i>
<i>he believed there had to be</i> <i>an
evolution of shadowhunters...</i>
<i>something more powerful.</i>
<i>he began experimenting
using</i> <i>the mortal cup.</i>
<i>he learned how to
summon demons.</i>
<i>he even injected himself with demon</i>
<i>blood so he could control them.</i>
<i>he wanted to rule.</i>
<i>your mother, to prevent that,</i>
<i>stole the cup from him...</i>
and vanished into thin air.
but if she's the only one that
knows where the cup is then...
maybe she isn't. maybe
she told someone else.
someone who doesn't
know she knows.
the silent brothers
are ready for her.
why didn't hodge come with us?
he hasn't left the institute in years.
some say it's a spell.
he's agoraphobic.
is that him?
no, that's harold,
the grounds keeper.
that's him.
<i>are you sure you want</i> <i>to
go through with this?</i>
<i>we will help you to remember.</i>
you'll wake the dead.
i can't believe this place
is just outside the city.
welcome to the city of bones.
this is where the silent
brothers draw their power...
from the bones and ashes
of shadowhunters.
all of them are buried here?
yes. one day that's
going to be me.
this is as far as i go.
you'll be fine.
so you've done this before?
no.
<i>you must listen
with your mind.</i>
<i>mom?</i>
<i>mom?</i>
<i>go, go.</i>
<i>clary, this is luke.</i>
<i>my dearest friend.</i>
<i>you can trust him.</i>
<i>hi, clary.</i>
<i>don't tell.</i>
<i>don't touch that old thing.</i>
<i>it's just an old cup, clary.</i>
clary...
clary, you okay?
clary.
the block is stronger
than anticipated.
it can only be undone by
the one who put it there.
i have no idea who put it there.
you wrote it.
your mind remembers
the inverted image.
you just have to look
at it differently.
b-a-n-e.
- bane.
- who?
magnus bane. he's a warlock.
i should have known.
well, let's go talk to him then.
not like that.
you need some help
from isabelle.
<i>- this is a top.</i>
- it's a dress.
i can't pull this off.
well, actually with
the right shoes...
no. i mean, this dress is so
tight it's like a second skin.
don't you have anything else?
if you go out looking
like your mundane self...
we won't get within a hundred
feet of magnus bane.
he's the high warlock
of brooklyn.
now stop complaining.
come over here.
hold this.
that guy alec doesn't
like me very much.
that guy alec is my brother.
does jace know how
alec feels about him?
is it that obvious?
it's really not
that big of a deal.
it isn't to me, either.
but it is to the clave.
i don't make the rules.
see? you're pretty.
how is being dressed like a hooker
going to help me find my mom?
easy now, those are my clothes.
doesn't she look great, alec?
looks like someone whose phone
number should be on a bathroom wall.
i think you look great.
wait, i've been here.
- wait.
- what?
- is that better?
- that's better. yeah.
well, well. look here.
i don't remember inviting any
children of the nephilim.
magnus bane. we need to talk.
you know i don't like you
guys, but i'll let you stay.
but only because of the hot one.
- thank you.
- thanks.
what?
i meant him.
the one with the blue eyes.
and because of clary.
wait. how do you know her name?
come with me.
- where's your mother?
- she's missing.
that explains it.
every year she brought you here.
she never missed an appointment.
not every spell turns out as
perfect as the one i did on you.
as soon as you started
drawing the angelic rune...
<i>it was a sign your memory</i>
<i>was surfacing.</i>
<i>i'd built that into your mind, so that</i>
<i>she knew when to bring you back.</i>
what you saw from the shadow
world, you would forget...
even as you saw it.
<i>but as you grew older, you needed</i>
<i>my treatment more frequently.</i>
<i>she knew she had to tell you one
day.</i> <i>but until you were ready...</i>
she wanted to keep the block on your mind.
it was exactly how she wanted it.
<i>so, how long do you think</i>
<i>we're going to be here?</i>
<i>relax, simon, okay.</i>
don't drink that!
simon!
it'll wear off over time.
it's already wearing off
or you wouldn't be here.
i need to remember.
my mom doesn't have time. please,
there must be something you can do.
you're the one who's been
buying all my mom's paintings.
why did you buy all of them?
i knew she needed the money.
you even have a
portrait of my dad.
that's not your dad. he's a
soldier who died in iraq.
jocelyn never even met the guy.
she was asked to paint his portrait
but it was too painful for the widow.
- she kept the pictures, though...
- so she could pretend he was my dad.
everything she did,
she did for you.
your mother's whole existence... the
running, the hiding, the lies...
were to keep you safe.
was anything she
ever told me true?
there's a treasure map
inside your head, clary.
find the cup and it will
lead you to your mother.
they've taken simon.
- who?
- vampires.
just remember, it was shadowhunters
your mother was running from.
let's go find simon.
<i>we can't break into</i> <i>a vampire's lair.
we never learn...</i>
- don't start again.
- jace, you know the rules.
guys, what are we doing here? i
thought we were trying to find simon.
we know where he is, we just
need to pick up a few things.
what is this, some kind of
deal you have with the church?
demons exist all across the world
in their varying different forms.
shadowhunters cling to
no particular religion.
and, in turn, all religions
assist us in our battle.
we could have as easily gone to a
jewish synagogue or a shinto temple.
here it is.
beneath every altar
in every church...
you'll find this.
so what do you believe in?
i believe in myself.
i know my job is to kill demons. i don't
have to believe in anything else.
- what about the angel raziel?
- it makes for a nice story.
- but hodge says...
- hodge needs to get out more.
- i thought...
- listen...
i've been hunting demons for
over a third of my life.
and in all that time i've
never seen an angel.
here.
here, you take this one.
- i don't...
- here, let me show you.
it's a vampire gun. you
must pierce the heart.
push it up against the chest.
fire.
recharge.
then you're good to go again.
"hotel of death"?
you can't say they don't
have a sense of humor.
come on.
- what is it about her?
- she's brave.
- we're shadowhunters. we're all brave.
- she wasn't raised like us.
- she's different.
- she's going to get us all killed.
it's simon's shirt.
he's up here.
simon!
- oh my god!
- clary, wait.
- clary!
- no, i can feel him!
give me a hand.
come on. come on.
these damn boots!
- here...
- there you go.
come on, guys, steady.
slowly.
careful.
- he's alive!
- careful.
go on. get out. they don't want me,
they want you. they want the cup!
- come on! let's go.
- i'm good.
let's go!
no, here.
in here!
jace!
behind you!
come on!
there's too many of them.
have a little faith.
run!
jace, i need a knife.
- the sun!
- let's go!
you help simon!
clary!
hold on!
thank you...
for saving simon.
- are you okay?
- i'm okay.
<i>clary.</i>
can i talk to you?
yeah. i was just going
to go see simon.
i want you to leave here.
- what?
- you almost got us killed.
i'm sorry. we didn't have a choice.
we had to save simon. and jace...
jace thinks he needs
to save the world.
but you don't need to
encourage him to do it.
- but that's what you guys do.
- yes!
<i>us,</i> what we do.
we're a team. you're
dead weight...
- a mundane.
- i'm not a mundane!
and if you were half as brave as
you pretend to be, you'd admit...
what?
you'd admit that you're
in love with jace.
and that's what this
is really about!
if you ever say anything
like that again...
i'll kill you.
- how long was i out?
- all day.
found your glasses.
one of the lenses cracked.
how weird.
i don't seem to
need them anymore.
so, what are you drawing?
nothing.
- you okay?
- yeah, it was crazy.
i'm sorry i didn't believe you before.
now i get it.
and... i must have passed out.
and then you showed up.
liste, i know...
i've always been the one who needed
you more than you needed me.
- it's not true.
- yes, it is. but i never cared.
i've only ever had my
mom, luke and you.
don't ever imagine that you
aren't important to me.
- okay.
- okay.
what did that piano
ever do to you?
you play it like you've
lost your only love.
unfortunately, my one
true love remains myself.
at least you don't have
to worry about rejection.
not necessarily.
i tear myself down occasionally
just to keep it interesting.
you do play that with
a lot of passion.
well, that's the problem. i
play it with too much emotion.
it's supposed to be played with a
simple representation of notes.
no interpretation.
music is supposed
to have emotion.
demons react to certain
frequencies when two tones cross.
it drives them crazy.
see, bach discovered this
and put it into a system...
using a mathematical progression
of tonal combinations.
it allows us to expose demons.
so bach was a shadowhunter?
yes.
so bach is to demons...
what garlic is to vampires.
kind of.
i mean, you can run out of garlic.
you can't really run out of music.
is that where you
keep all your toys?
it's way more fun. come on.
it's a portal. like the bermuda
triangle, it's a natural phenomenon.
the institute was
built around it.
some say the institute was the
first building in new york.
dimensions aren't all
just straight lines.
there's bends, folds and nooks.
it's a little bit difficult
to explain but...
...the portal can take you wherever
you want to go in this dimension.
so, as soon as you
break that surface...
you're transported to wherever
your deepest thoughts lie.
- so that means my mom!
- wait!
we spend our entire lives
training how to use it...
visualizing where it will take
us before we step into it...
and that takes incredible focus.
if you were to step into it
without the proper training...
you could end up in limbo,
lost in your own mind forever.
here, let me show you.
come on.
no peeking.
pretty cool, isn't it?
now, you and i...
have a birthday to celebrate.
how did you know?
research, when i was
trying to find you.
<i>no one comes up here anymore.</i>
<i>we have the place to ourselves.</i>
this is breathtaking.
sorry, there's no cake.
i was expecting nothing.
so this is great.
well, everyone should get
something for their birthday.
- what did you get?
- weapons, mostly.
- i'm sure that doesn't surprise you.
- at this point nothing really does.
when i was nine...
my father gave me a falcon.
he told me to make it obedient.
i was supposed to keep the bird blind,
but i couldn't bring myself to do it.
instead i touched and stroked
its wings until it trusted me.
i tamed it to perfection.
i took it to my father expecting
him to be proud of what i'd done.
he said: "i told you
to make it obedient."
instead you taught
it to love you.
you didn't tame it,
you broke it...
he took the bird and
broke its neck.
i cried all night and
i never cried again.
did you ever forgive him?
he did it to make me stronger.
does that stand for wayland?
midnight.
watch this.
<i>when your soul</i> <i>finds the soul.</i>
<i>it always waited for.</i>
<i>when someone walks
into your heart.</i>
<i>through an open door.</i>
<i>when your hand</i> <i>finds the hand.</i>
when a girl says she wants a big rock,
she doesn't literally mean a big rock.
every shadowhunter should
have their own witchlight.
we have company.
that's hodge's bird.
we should probably go.
<i>don't let go.</i>
<i>when someone comes
into your life.</i>
<i>it's like they've</i> <i>been
in your life forever.</i>
<i>no</i> <i>there's no one else's eyes.</i>
<i>who can see into me.</i>
<i>no one else's arms can lift.</i>
<i>lift me up so high.</i>
<i>your love lifts me
out of sight.</i>
<i>- and you know where i belong</i>
- okay. we should definitely go.
<i>but you know my
heart by heart.</i>
<i>but you know my heart by heart</i>
i'm sorry about the
sprinkler system.
i forgot about that.
are you going to sleep?
are you tired?
i've never been more awake.
- simon! i thought you were...
- asleep? yeah, i was.
we were just...
next time it might be a nice idea
to mention that you already have...
a man in your bed, so we can avoid
such uncomfortable situations.
- you invited him to bed?
- i know. it's ridiculous, isn't it?
- we would never have all fit.
- i didn't invite him into bed.
we were just kissing.
how swiftly you
dismiss our love.
jace!
- it's late and i'm sorry we woke you.
- so am i.
go ahead, go after him.
go apologize to him.
go tell him just how
special he really is.
- stop acting like that!
- like what?
like nothing ever hurts you.
well, maybe you should have thought
about that <i>before</i> you kissed me.
i kissed you?
don't worry. it wasn't that
special for me, either.
i'm really sorry, simon.
- but weren't you just in the...
- i was just looking for you.
- where are you going?
- home.
it's clear i
overstayed my welcome.
i'm sorry, okay? it wasn't
like it was planned.
let me guess: it just happened.
please!
- look, i know you don't like him but...
- actually, i hate the guy!
- why?
- i thought you were better than that.
and what's that
supposed to mean?
i'm the one who's always
been there for you, not him!
i'm in love with you.
and it's clear that you
don't feel the same way.
- it's...
- don't.
there's nothing to say.
and, clary, he's just
using you to get the cup.
simon...
your mother was the only other
person who could do that.
but i've never been
able to do this before.
apparently, the block wasn't
just repressing your memories...
but your abilities as well.
- jace, i...
- don't tell me. 762f=.
you have a drawing emergency
and you need a nude model.
- i'm not in the mood.
- listen!
i know where my mom hid the cup.
- hey.
- hi.
clary, wow. you
look different.
yeah, it's just
something i borrowed.
i mean, nice outfit.
it's good.
yeah... i can't talk now. sorry.
clary.
i came for the tarot cards.
<i>- why?</i>
<i>- i need them.</i>
<i>you know, the ones
my mom painted.</i>
<i>i just need to look at them really</i>
<i>quickly and i'll give them back.</i>
those weapons can't
come in here.
this is a peaceful house.
put them in there.
how are you feeling today?
fine. just fine.
young man, that
piano's out of tune.
please don't.
young man...
stop.
that song...
not one of my favorites.
stop!
let's have a look!
clary, get out!
hi, madame dorothea.
have you seen clary? i just got
a text that said she was here.
no.
okay. well, i'll just...
simon!
simon!
simon! it's not really her!
i'll take care of him.
simon!
she's got the cup!
simon!
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
jace!
the runes aren't working.
simon, you follow me.
you cut these up.
- don't, you've done enough.
- don't talk to her like that.
- this isn't her fault.
- you're right. this is your fault.
- isabelle!
- alec kept telling you...
that you were going to get hurt.
you were going to get us all hurt.
now he's the one dying.
well, we needed to
get the mortal cup.
but there are other ways to do it
than getting your best friend killed.
why don't you go get hodge?
i never wanted anything to
happen to alec. i'm sorry.
we agreed to do this together.
we're a team.
since clary got here we
haven't been a team.
hodge!
<i>hodge!</i>
alec's getting worse.
i know.
i've already sent for someone.
did you get the cup?
what now?
hodge.
you've no idea what it's like
living with the clave's curse...
unable to set so much
as a foot outside.
afraid to even open a window.
try not to judge me
too harshly, clary.
hodge, what have you done?
i always knew you would
bring me the cup.
it was only a matter of time.
where is she?
she's fine.
you got what you want,
now let her go.
i have to make sure you
gave me the real one.
everybody wants the cup
for the wrong reason.
and you don't?
with this cup i can
cleanse our bloodlines...
save our race.
you might not know much
about mundane history...
but i can tell you when people start
talking about preserving a race...
it never goes well.
that's why my mom spent her
whole life hiding it from you.
no. she wasn't hiding the cup.
she was hiding you.
- drink.
- i'm not going to drink that.
why are you so afraid?
you've been drinking this
since before you were born.
i fed it to your mother
while you were in her womb.
come on, clary. you must
have guessed by now.
these amazing talents that your mother
so desperately tried to suppress.
where do you think
they came from?
you're my daughter.
my blood runs in your veins.
now... drink.
drink!
take it out!
no!
someone just went
through the portal.
i'll go check.
sorry. i got a bit carried away.
- luke, you're a...
- clary, listen to me.
- listen. don't be afraid. listen.
- don't touch me!
hey. there's no need for that.
that thing will be back.
we are not safe out here.
i jumped through the portal
to get away from valentine.
i thought i'd wind
up with my mom.
instead, i end up in the
last place i wanted to be.
listen...
the portal brought you here because
you must have been thinking of me.
deep inside you know
you can trust me.
you said you couldn't care less
what happened to either of us.
you just want the cup
like everyone else.
i said that to protect you.
what else could i do?
been keeping an eye on
you this whole time.
that was you at the hotel.
good throw, by the way.
what about me?
- what about you?
- we had a deal.
well, i still don't
have my cup, do i?
i held up my end of the bargain.
- no, you didn't.
- i gave you the cup.
you handed it to clary. that's
not my fault. now lift it.
listen, it's all in your head.
no. no.
- there's a spell.
- really? a spell?
that's just an excuse
for a real problem...
in there.
do you really think
i can fix that?
i give you the cup, you
take away the fear.
without the cup i'm
as stuck as you are.
except my fear is real.
every downworlder, every
member of the clave...
every shadowhunter...
on both sides of the portal
is looking for me right now.
i'm going to need all
the help i can get.
you don't have to go through
with this, valentine.
a demon has never set
foot in the institute.
well, maybe it's time they did.
i've been waiting all
these years to do this.
clary's given me no choice.
she'll come back.
really?
and what makes you so sure?
there's someone here she
wants as much as her mother.
if you lie and tell them
they're both your children...
you'll break their hearts.
what can i say?
the broken make the
best followers.
look at you. to
love is to destroy.
where the hell is hodge?
we don't have much time.
does this look right to you?
no.
hey, look.
magnus?
i'm going to need all of this.
lots of it.
take this.
lock this place down.
don't do that!
valentine.
jonathan.
how do you know my real name?
nobody calls me that.
is it true? is
valentine my father?
you know, he was a great man...
until his conflict
with the clave.
<i>but when your mother</i> <i>ran
away with the cup...</i>
<i>he was just so afraid</i> <i>of
retribution from the clave...</i>
<i>he burnt their house
to the ground.</i>
<i>he wanted the world</i> <i>to
believe he was dead.</i>
<i>in the ashes we found the remains</i>
<i>of a man and a child.</i>
wait a second,
there was a child?
valentine was so enraged...
he wanted her to believe he
killed himself and their son...
your brother.
i have a brother?
jonathan christopher
morgenstern.
you're lying. my name
is jace wayland.
and my family are the wayland.
you think clary is the only
one with a block in her mind?
let me show you the truth.
you didn't tame him.
you broke him.
no!
you are not my father.
i came back to help you
understand who you really are.
i know you're unhappy here.
plagued by rules.
your place is next to me.
you're a morgenstern.
and you're my son.
my name is jace wayland.
i'm a wayland.
sorry to break this to you, but
it's time you heard the truth.
don't.
it's all a matter of perception.
you see? morgenstern.
- take this.
- okay.
isabelle...
clary? we found your mom.
they found her. she's
at the institute.
alaric.
<i>it's luke, can you see it?</i>
yeah, i see it.
guys, we have to go.
luke needs us.
- where're we headed?
- the institute.
we'd be breaking the accords.
not if we stay human.
- let's go, guys!
- go, go!
come on, move it!
move it!
ready to go. they've
all been briefed.
this is alaric.
he's one of us.
go ahead. you can hang your head
out the window if you need to.
i'm a werewolf, not
a golden retriever.
<i>simon!</i>
- just wait here, i'll be back.
- what? no.
isabelle, i can't just...
no. isabelle.
come on, isabelle,
where are you?
alright, move it!
come on, move it!
alright.
the werewolves are
here to save us.
never thought i'd say that.
finally! isabelle.
<i>open up the door.</i>
it looks like he's responding.
he'll survive.
and be careful.
you're being invaded.
<i>summoning all these
bloody demons...</i>
run!
run!
- where are we going?
- there's another exit!
wait.
isabelle!
- i almost killed you.
- yeah.
- are you okay?
- yeah, i'm fine.
this place is full of demons.
that's impossible. the
institute is hallowed ground.
no one seems to have
told them that.
someone on the inside
must have let them in.
this is a rescue mission. we are
not equipped to fight demons.
spread out! that way.
move back! come on!
we could use some help, alaric!
alaric!
come on. there must be some
other way out of here, right?
no, there isn't, simon!
we can't hold them much longer.
step away.
step away!
clary, which rune is that?
- i don't know, it's just...
- i've never seen it before.
- really?
- it's not in the book.
it's fading.
they're coming in through somewhere.
i'm going to stop them.
come on.
you guys go. we'll catch up.
no!
they're coming from the dome.
come on.
jocelyn, you never
left my heart.
i've come to take you home.
she's not going anywhere.
how did you get up here?
you're even more powerful
than i anticipated.
get away from her.
what the hell?
just listen to what
he has to say.
it's not what you think.
finally...
both my children together.
my daughter and my son.
i'm so sorry, clary.
i didn't know.
valentine's lying.
you're michael wayland's son.
luke said my brother is dead.
he died in a fire and they found
his remains in the ashes.
i took jonathan
with me when i ran.
the bones were of a
child killed by wolves.
i wish it wasn't true.
she doesn't want
to believe you...
because she is in love
with you, jonathan.
i thought your name was jace.
jace is a nickname.
jonathan christopher...
j.c.
jace.
there's the lever.
you go close the dome
and i'll hold them off.
take out the cup, clary.
take out my cup!
i want that cup!
you said you wouldn't hurt her!
that's enough.
now!
- it's stuck!
- close it!
i can't!
i think there's a piece missing!
clary!
i really need this!
mom?
- find the others.
- alright.
alright. you want to take the
upstairs or the downstairs?
i'm not too crazy
about the basement.
i can't hold them
back any longer.
simon, hurry!
<i>clary.</i>
hello, mr. garroway.
looks like you're
having a "ruff" day.
i guess the humane thing
to do in this situation...
would be to put you down.
but you wanted to see me change?
i do.
get up!
so, boy, how far do you
want to take this?
to the end.
simon!
isabelle!
lean on me!
- get out! go on!
- okay.
get out of here!
come on.
go!
somebody told me that
you like to play music.
johann would be very proud.
now you shall die
by raziel's sword.
stop!
or i'll drop it!
you don't want to do that.
don't give it to him, clary.
i need you to listen to me.
as your father, i'm begging you.
if you'd been a real dad,
you'd know me well enough...
to imagine where the cup is.
where my deepest
thoughts are taking it.
you don't know the
first thing about me.
you're not my dad. and
you never will be.
i promise you'll never
have to see me again.
thank you, clary.
without this cup, we are lost.
not we...
you.
clary, no!
- don't let me go!
- never!
here!
are you okay?
i don't know.
i understand why you
did what you did.
and i forgive you.
i want you to know that...
your secret's safe with me.
hey.
so, how's she doing?
stable.
the doctors don't know what she
took, so we just have to wait.
i'm sorry.
i guess i'm an old romantic.
i always hoped that when i finally
said "i love you" to someone...
she'd say the same thing back.
- and that someone will.
- yeah. i know.
you're tired, go sleep.
we'll take care of her.
- okay.
- yeah? come on.
<i>underneath the echoes.</i>
<i>buried in the shadows.</i>
<i>to see your ghost.</i>
<i>but you must know.</i>
<i>i'll be here waiting.</i>
<i>hoping, praying that.</i>
<i>this light will
guide you home.</i>
<i>when you're feeling lost.</i>
<i>i'll leave my love</i>
i like what you've
done with the place.
i've got a few
tricks up my sleeve.
clary, we're afraid
you're not coming back.
it's just really hard to
be around you right now.
it's hard for me, as well.
but this is about more than us.
you have an incredible
gift and we need you.
i need you.
i just don't know.
remember when i said i'd
never seen an angel?
well, i lied.
you're still the bravest
mundane i've ever met.
i'm not a mundane.
wait, jace!
<i>be here waiting.</i>
you took your time.
you said you needed me.
<i>when you're feeling.</i>
- you should keep that safe.
- yeah.
is it okay if i...?
- do i...? is it okay if i...?
- yeah.
look, clary, i don't believe it.
it doesn't feel like the truth.
not in my heart.
i just don't know how to
look at the world anymore.
i don't see streets and traffic lights and cars.
i see demons and angels.
- everything's different.
- the world's the same.
you're the one who's different.
- don't you remember what hodge said?
- what?
all the stories are true.
