the man who knows all the answers.

so jamal, are you ready for the
first question, for 1000 rupees?
yes.
not bad money to sit on a chair
and answer a question.
better than making tea, no?
no. yes. no.
no? yes? no? is that your final answer?
so remember. you have three lifelines.
ask the audience, fifty-fifty
and call a friend.
so the first question, for 1000 rupees,
here we go.
who was the star in the 1973
hit-film "zanjeer"?
i'm in trouble, here...

get out of there, jamal.
prakash wants a big one.
not finished.
stop your time-pass boys. this is urgent...
it's a shy one...
and since when there is
a time limit on a crap?
this is borderline kid. get a move on...
since there was a customer waiting,
that's when jamal!
give me the money back!

so is it your father's train then?
hey, the boy stealing the paratas!
get off me.
is this heaven?
you are not dead, jamal.
what is it?
some hotel huh?
the taj mahal is considered the
finest example of mugal architecture.
taj mahal was completed around 1648 using
the labour force of 20'000 workers.
in 1980 it became a unesco
world heritage site and was cited as the...
official tour guide.
please take off your shoes
please, please.
what time is the next tour?
we are on tight schedule.
we have to see the red
fort this afternoon.
visitors are requested to collect receipt
- no, i...
- please, would it be possible
to show us up round now?
obviously we understand that it
costs more for just the two of us.
but of course madam!
please follow me.
the taj mahal was built by emperor khurrama
for his wife mumtaz, who was the
maximum beautiful woman in the world.
then when she died, the emperor
decided to build this five-star hotel,
for everyone who would
like to visit her tomb.
but he died in 1587 before any of the
rooms were built, or any of the lifts.
but this swimming pool as you can see was
completed on schedule in top class fashion.
is says nothing of this in the guide book.
the guide book was written by a bunch
of lazy good-for-nothing indian beggars.
and this lady and gentlemen
is the burial place of mumtaz.
how did she die?
- a road traffic accident.
- really?
maximum pile-up.
i thought she died in childbirth.
exactly sir. she was on the way
to hospital when it happened.
ready?
smile.
shoes! american brands!
it's high temperature, huh?
smile.
hey thieves, stop!
this, mr david, is the biggest
dhobi ghat in the whole of india.
that's amazing.
come on, take a real good look at this.
they say that every man in uttar pradesh
is wearing a kurta that has been
at least washed once out here.
fast, fast!
move it around! pit-stop's god
speed! schumacher's style!
there are the cows or are those
buffalos... what are those over there?
go, go. let's run!
oh, shit.
what the hell happened here?
motherfucker!
ok, that's enough!
ok. hold it!
hold it, will you.
you've got the insurance don't you?
are you ok?
you wanted to see a bit
of real india? here it is!
alright!
well, here is a bit of
the real america, son.
("money")
oh, yes, yes! jesus...

which american statesman?
a: george washington
