mr. secretary.
i wasn't aware you were in russia.
i'm not.
not since a bomb blew up the kremlin.
yesterday i flew in
to accept the order of friendship
from the russian prime minister.
now i'm headed back to washington
to hand the president my resignation.
my chief analyst, william brandt.
do you have a pen?
- pardon me?
- a pen.
yeah.
ethan, what happened in the kremlin?
chief analyst, you say?
if you're implying that
i made a bad call...
european male.
fifties. about six-foot,
who is he?
a crude drawing,
but by your description,
that could be kurt hendricks.
swedish special forces.
professor of physics,
stockholm university.
specialist in nuclear endgame theory.
asked to resign...
well, because he's crazy.
cobalt.
you have to alert the kremlin
that one of their strategists
has a nuclear launch device
and one of his operatives
has the codes to activate it.
and what makes you say that?
i saw him
<i>leaving the executive armory,
bag in hand.</i>
he set off that explosion
to cover his tracks.
it could be weeks
before the russians know it's missing.
unless we tell them.
<font color="#808080">imf secretary:</font>
they won't listen to us.
as far as the russians are concerned,
we just bombed the kremlin.
the tension between
the united states and russia
hasn't been this high
since the cuban missile crisis.
and the blame, right or wrong,
points to imf.
the president has initiated
ghost protocol.
the entire imf has been disavowed.
so what happens now?
now, i've been ordered
to take you back to washington,
where the dod will label you
as a rogue extremist
and hang the kremlin bombing
on you and your team.
unless,
you were to escape
somewhere between here
and the airport,
having assaulted mr. brandt and me.
sir?
you would then
illegally scrounge
whatever material you could
from a backup supply cache
that i've overlooked.
the same cache where
your team are waiting for further orders.
sir, you may want to...
you will then disappear, and this
conversation never having taken place,
your intentions would be unclear.
but if any one of your team
is caught or killed,
they will be branded terrorists,
out to incite global nuclear war.
your mission,
should you choose to accept it.
<font color="#d900d9">(sighs)</font> ethan, you were my best man.

imf now believes this man,
kurt hendricks,
is the nuclear extremist,
code name cobalt.
today he was seen leaving the kremlin,
with what is likely
a nuclear launch device.
two days ago, sabine moreau killed
one of our agents in budapest
and relieved him
of russian nuclear launch codes.
intel indicates she will check into
the burj hotel in dubai in 36 hours.
marius wistrom
is a known operative of cobalt.
wistrom is currently en route to dubai.
for the launch device to work,
cobalt needs the activation codes.
he's sending wistrom
to buy them from moreau.
the secretary
is dead.
the president
has invoked ghost protocol.
we're shut down.
no satellite, safe house,
support, or extraction.
the four of us
and the contents of this car
are all that remain of the imf.
and as of this moment, any action
is unsanctioned. so if you want out,
speak now.
our mission is hendricks.
we're all that stands
between him and his goal.
nothing can be left to chance.
everyone connected with this man
is considered an asset with valuable
information about our target.
no one can know we're still on line.
we lose hendricks now,
we lose him forever.
so, what's the play?
wistrom will take delivery from moreau
in 36 hours.
now we cannot let
the launch codes leave the hotel,
but we need wistrom
to lead us to hendricks.
he'll only do that if he has the codes.
<font color="#808080">jane:</font> or if he thinks he has them.
our objective is to intercept the sale,
replace the authentic
codes with counterfeits
and follow wistrom to hendricks.
well, that's simple enough.
we snatch the codes,
we gin up some fakes.
jane, you double moreau, and sell the
codes to wistrom and bob's your uncle.
and how do you propose
we just snatch the codes from moreau?
we take her out.
yeah, we take her out.
but, you know, discreetly.
discreetly?
yeah.
right, she's an asset. right. i get it.
sorry. nothing left to chance.
he said... i'm spitballing.
it's not all gonna be gold.
- we don't touch wistrom.
<font color="#808080">benji:</font> - all right.
or moreau.
she'll answer for hanaway,
but it has to be when i say.
after we hit hendricks.
<font color="#808080">ethan:</font> only pack what we need.
yeah, absolutely. only pack what we...
you never know.
<font color="#d900d9">(horn honking)</font>
<font color="#808080">brandt:</font> so even if we can double
wistrom and moreau,
how do we keep them in separate rooms
while having them think that
they're in the same room?
<font color="#808080">ethan:</font> we give the hotel a facelift.
wistrom will think
he's arriving at moreau's suite,
but, really, he'll be
walking into our decoy room.
where i'll double moreau.
downstairs, benji will double wistrom.
masks!
and meet with the real moreau.
and, uh... <font color="#d900d9">(chuckles)</font>
what am i doing?
you? you're the helper!
<font color="#d900d9">(chuckles)</font> helper. that's great.
okay, so to the extent i understand
what you're talking about here...
the burj khalifa,
it's the tallest building in the world,
and you want to alter its infrastructure
with the hopes of convincing
two people that they've
had a meeting,
which actually really never happened.
right?
- uh...
<font color="#d900d9">(tires screech)</font>
oh!
<font color="#d900d9">(jane groans)</font>
<font color="#d900d9">(laughter)</font>

<font color="#808080">ethan on radio:</font>

on my way up.
okay, 34 minutes to door knock.
wow, um... <font color="#d900d9">(clears throat)</font>
okay, this is a slight wrinkle,
but nothing to worry about.
we're just going to have to go into
the server room from the outside.
what?
well, the firewalls on this building's
server are military grade.
i mean, this would be a cinch
if i could call youssef
back at headquarters,
but youssef doesn't exist any more,
and neither do we.
i could hack it,
but it would take too long.
then hardwire in.
and there's four layers
of next-gen security
between us and the server room.
there's no way
we can get to it from inside.
if we can't get to the server,
we don't control the elevators,
we don't control the security cameras.
this operation is over
before it even begins.
i'm telling you,
we can get to it from outside.
"we"?
i'm... i'm on the computer.
i'm just, uh...
the helper.
what floor is it on?
oh, 130.
- vent ducts.
- pressure sensitive.
not enough time.
- elevator shaft.
- infrared sensors.
not enough time.
how am i supposed to do this?

that's full adhesion.

- and when it's red?
- dead.
here's your cutter, okay?
and your server interface.

okay, ethan, the hotel server is
eleven stories up and seven units over.

you sure i shouldn't wear a mask?

this is your tracking device.
- this is what you're tracking.
- the paper clip?
no, it's the paper.
it's in the briefcase. it's coated with
isotopes which give off a unique...
it just means
that you can track the documents
even if they switch briefcases.
range?
not that good. it's, like, half a mile.
safest thing to do would be not let
wistrom out of your sight.
is that wistrom?
who's that with him?
i don't know. we don't have an uplink,
so there's no facial recognition.
who's that with him?
that's leonid lisenker.
polish-born cryptographer.
he redesigned russia's nuclear
security after the cold war.
he's here to authenticate
the launch codes.
- yes, he is. we are blown.
- no, we're not blown.
well, we will be as soon as he sees
the counterfeit launch codes.
we're not blown.

<font color="#d900d9">(elevator stops)</font>
benji, how long would it take you
to reprogram the case?
a couple of seconds. what for, though?
to make an exact copy
of the launch codes.
- what?
- you can't do that.
- wistrom's on 22!
- slow him down.
i'll do what i can.
<font color="#d900d9">(elevator stops)</font>
wait, wait. ethan, hang on now!
hang on. just a second.
you're talking about handing over active
nuclear launch codes to wistrom?
yes. reprogram the case.
listen... stop!
just listen to what you're saying.
you're fixating.
you're not thinking clearly.
it's not gonna happen. i won't let it!
brandt, use your head now.
the mission is not the codes,
the mission is hendricks.
then just let it play out.
give him bad codes. neutralize him.
you know that won't do it.
failure to a terrorist
is just a rehearsal for success.
we lose hendricks today,
he shows up somewhere else tomorrow.
he finds another way.
with no imf to stop him.
no. it's now or never.
now, brandt, give me the case.
nothing can be left to chance.
you said that.
you're the analyst.
now, tell me there's not another way
for hendricks to get those codes.
<font color="#808080">benji:</font> 50!

- because you're communications!
you're in charge of covering our tracks.
<font color="#808080">brandt:</font> you cannot afford to

you're not a technician any more.
you're a field agent.
and you're just an "analyst."
right?

<font color="#808080">jane:</font> wait. that's it?
what are you going to do,

would you care to explain yourself,
agent brandt?
<font color="#d900d9">(overlapping chatter
in arabic)</font>
i was on a protection detail in croatia.
shadowing the assets,
husband and wife.
they were never supposed to know
we were there.
whole thing's routine, it was a milk run.
three days in
we caught wind that a serbian hit squad
was after our couple.
but my team had it under control.
we knew they were coming.
but i couldn't shake this feeling that i
should warn the couple somehow.
i wanted to find a way to let them know.
but, you know, orders are orders,
so i didn't.
<font color="#d900d9">(sighs)</font>
one day, the husband decides
to leave the hotel and go for a run,
so i follow him,
and i leave two men with the wife.
when i get back, my guys are
unconscious and the wife is gone.
local police found her body
three days later.
what was left of her, anyway.
that was my last day in the field.
i couldn't face another
life-or-death situation after that.
so what happened to the husband?
i never saw him again.
until two days ago in moscow,
when the secretary
introduced me to ethan hunt.
no, that's not what happened.
she left him.
<font color="#808080">brandt:</font> yeah, i heard that one,
too, benji.
but, unfortunately, i was there.
just like i was there
when the secretary got the phone call
that ethan was in custody for killing
six serbian nationals in cold blood.
an unsanctioned hit.
yeah.
disavowed.
<font color="#d900d9">(sighs)</font>
the next thing i know,
i'm on a plane to dubai,
wondering the whole time, do i tell him?
how do i tell him?
that i'm responsible.
i could have warned him.
i should have warned him.
but i didn't.
and she died.
sergei! sergei, my friend!
i told you i would get him here.
didn't i say?
how do i know it's him?
yes, it's him.
you trust me, i trust you. right?
this is the guy!
this is the guy, the one i told you about.
so we can take these things off.
<font color="#d900d9">(rattles handcuffs)</font>
sorry. he's a great guy,
but he doesn't know you like i do.
<font color="#808080">man:</font> so, you work for
the american government.
<font color="#808080">ethan:</font> and you're an arms dealer.
<font color="#808080">bogdan:</font> no, no, no. sergei. sergei.
he's "independent
defense coordinator." right?
that you are. very classy job.
listen. he's a friend.
those diamonds are for bogdan.
no, no. it's okay. you can have them.
whatever arrangements you made with
my cousin is between you and him.
you want something from me, you pay.
you misunderstand.
i'm not buying. i'm selling.
you're selling. <font color="#d900d9">(chuckles)</font>
selling what?
the future.
yeah, i got all i need, thank you.
<font color="#808080">ethan:</font> our countries
are on the brink of war.
war is very good for business.
nuclear war?
go on.
i'm looking for a man
named kurt hendricks.
you may know him as cobalt.
in either case,
i think you know what he wants.
i'll bet he even tried
to buy it from you at some point.
go on.
he has a case, he has codes.
but they're worthless
without a tactical satellite.
i want to know where he'd get it.
a man with information like that
would be a potential terrorist.
and to your government,
a potential terrorist is a terrorist.
if you help me,
my friends become your friends.
sorry.
i cannot help you.
i certainly cannot tell you
that russia quietly sold
an obsolete tactical satellite
to a certain telecom in mumbai.
and whoever gave them that idea?
<font color="#d900d9">(chuckles)</font> an enterprising third party.
working on commission.
helping old friends. making new ones.
can the satellite be shut down?
that would take special skills,
and you cannot do it alone.
what's in the bags?
it's our gear.
how'd you get it?
made a friend.
well, i'm glad we could help.
you could help now.
look, ethan, before we...
<font color="#808080">ethan:</font> whatever happened, happened.
we still have a chance to clean this up,
but we have to do it now.
and we have to do it together.
okay. so, where are we going?
india.
- india? india?
- sure.
okay. great.
love the jet.

i've been busy with other things.

<font color="#d900d9">(chuckles)</font>
i understand you're looking
for an american...
i am.
you're also looking for a nuclear launch

on the surface,
his entire network is state-of-the-art.
but it's built on illegally acquired.
cold war cast-offs, including this,
the novosti satellite.
hendricks needs it
to launch a nuclear strike,
and we have to shut it down
before he gets that chance.
and to do that, we need to get
the access code from him.
one way or another.
and if i don't,
none of this works.
you can do this.
yeah.
a week ago, i would have believed you.
i don't blame you for what happened.
she took someone you cared about.
that's not something you just
let go.
did it make you feel better?
when you killed the men
who killed your wife?
we can't get them back.
okay, to shut down the satellite,
we have to manually tap into
the central server.
you'll enter through the exhaust vent,
wearing this under your suit.
<font color="#d900d9">(electrical hum)</font>
drop down into the computer array,
and i'll catch you,
then move you along the relay room

okay, so we enter the party
separately as guests.
ethan quarterbacks while jane...
gets the codes from the billionaire.
i switch off the fan,
you jump into the computer array,
and i catch you,
you plug in the transmitter
then ethan feeds me the codes which i
then use to pinpoint hendricks' location.
okay, but you just breezed over
something i think is really important.
the computer array part, where i just...
jump?
- and i catch you.
- yeah.
i don't... why is that so hard to grasp?
well...
why? it's a 25-foot drop.
and we're using magnets.
yeah.
in light of our recent efforts,
the technology's...
the science is sound. all right?
i'd be more worried about the heat.
and then there's that. what heat?
well, it's like any computer, isn't it?
if you switch off the fan,
it's gonna get really hot!
<font color="#d900d9">(chuckles)</font> of course.
relatively, you know.
of course it will. so i'm jumping into a...
uh, an oven, essentially.
yeah. essentially.
but, um, i'll catch you.
great.
