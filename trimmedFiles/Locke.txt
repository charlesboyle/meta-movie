(blows nose)
ivan locke.
donal: i just got your
message. it's a joke, is it?
look, i know it's a shock,
but it will be okay.
okay. (chuckles)
yes, well, i will go through
everything with you and it'll be okay.
you know where i am, ivan?
i'm at the service station.
i'm turning the fucking van around.
i put a few other lads on the hard
shoulder. i was halfway home.
- yeah.
- what the fuck's happened?
- it's a family thing.
- right.
is someone... has...
is it a bereavement?
i don't have a choice.
is it one of the kids?
donal, look, i just need you to fix this
up and be all right, okay? and solid.
which you are. which you are, okay?
just from when the sun
comes up tomorrow morning
until when it's all been pumped.
i need you to hold it
together for me, okay?
you won't be alone.
i will be on the phone.
i will talk to you every five
minutes until the pump is finished.
- talk to me, what, on the phone?
- on the phone.
- (siren blaring)
- what? have you gone mad?
no, i don't think so.
ivan, at 5:45 tomorrow morning,
we have 350 metric tons of wet
concrete being delivered to the site.
we've got 200 trucks from all over the
fucking country descending on us at 5:45.
okay, this is a joke, is it?
i have no choice.
ivan, look, i hate myself even
hearing myself saying this,
but if someone has died,
like your mother or...
- no one is dead, donal.
- ...just go where you have to
- go tomorrow after 12:00.
- hey, listen, i need you to just do this, okay?
i need you to be there
with enough stuff
and the right heads when the
sun comes up. that's it.
holy fucking mary! i can't.
i'm a fucking concrete farmer.
you've never seen me read
anything written down on paper.
- i can't...
- you're okay. listen, you're okay.
you know how to run a pump, don't you?
you know how to run trucks back to back
and turn trucks back, and you
know how to test for slumps.
i've never even shoveled
on a pump this big!
well, it's the same. it's
just there's more of it.
you just... you just do
the same but for longer.
you check it, slump it,
send it back if it's piss
and pump it if it's
right. that's it.
- what does gareth say about this?
- i haven't spoken to him yet.
oh, well, he's gonna fucking...
he's gonna...
he'll go fucking sideways
around the houses...
i know.
- ...like his arse is on fire.
- i know. i know.
- i know.
- ivan, you're gonna get the sack.
i know, donal.
jesus, you're the best foreman
i've ever fucking worked with!
the best site manager.
what the hell is it
that's gonna make you go and risk...
you're gonna risk the sack?
look, i need you to do
this for me, donal, right?
so, start rounding up some
cowboys and then call me back.
i'll be on the road.
(car phone ringing)
(exhales sharply)
(continues ringing)
- ivan locke.
- bethan: ivan?
where are you?
um, i just got admitted.
i'm in the labor ward.
it's called bailey ward.
did they say how long?
- i'm five centimeters.
- what does that mean?
- dilated.
- i know what that means, but how long?
i... they just... they just
left me. i'm on my own.
- is there a bell?
- a what?
i don't know, a buzzer or
something to get a nurse.
they just put their head round
and they said it could be hours.
are you okay?
- um, i need the loo.
- well, tell them. tell them.
- well, there's no one here.
- well, is there a bell?
they don't have bells.
what do you mean?
when they put their
head around the door,
you tell them that you
need the lavatory.
it's like a pain i've never had right
inside, all the way up to my chest.
have you talked to
anyone about the pain?
no, what... what do you mean?
ivan, what do you mean?
i'm saying, have you talked to
anybody about stopping the pain?
- have you decided?
- well, they said let's see.
well, just have whatever
there is, seriously.
- what?
- i don't know. for the pain.
because it's fucking...
jesus, it's...
it's cold and all the
windows are open.
tell them to close the windows.
and the traffic is okay.
go to the lavatory.
i'll be there.
(inhales sharply)
have you even told your wife
that someone's having your baby?
i'm about to do that.
i have, uh... i have a list of things that
i have to do tonight while i'm driving.
- so, am i on a list?
- yes. tonight, yes.
do you love me?
that's a question you're asking probably
because of the pain or something.
how could i love you?
(scoffs)
- i...
- (line disconnects)
- (sighs) hell.
- (car phone ringing)
katrina: hi, love.
- hello, katrina.
- hi, love.
look, i got you, um, six
of the german lagers
and i got sausages.
i thought we could have hot
dogs again. oh, oh, oh.
(laughs) and guess what?
i am finally wearing the shirt.
ivan?
did eddie not give you the message?
- what message?
- i'm not coming home.
(tv playing)
what?
what do you mean?
it's the match. i'm
wearing the shirt.
which phone are you on?
- what do you mean?
- i can hear the tv.
can you take this call upstairs,
on the phone upstairs?
upstairs? why?
i have... i have something...
i have something to say.
well, can't it wait
until you get home?
i won't be home.
what's happened?
will you just... will you
get to the phone upstairs?
what's happened?
just go to the phone in the bedroom
and i'll tell you what's happened.
okay.
sean, when i shout, put
the phone down, please.
- eddie: hey, dad, are you coming back?
- eddie.
yeah, i'm talking to your mother.
he hasn't put any wingers on and
he's put caldwell back on again.
katrina: hello?
eddie, will you put the
phone down, please?
dad, i can't believe
the team he's picked.
eddie, please, can you put
the phone down, please?
katrina: eddie.
- (puts down receiver)
- (ivan sniffles)
so, go on, tell me. what is it?
last year, this job...
you know, the job in croydon.
do you remember? i was up and down
there for three months. remember?
yes.
i stayed in the guesthouse,
the one that had, uh...
it had bad damp, i said.
remember? the, uh...
(breathes deeply)
yeah.
they gave me an assistant.
she worked with me on
the block construction.
- she?
- she was a secretary, quite old.
we, uh... we worked together.
she's quite old and
she lives on her own.
she's 43 or something.
she's, uh...
why are you telling
me about some woman?
this is the only time i ever did
this, katrina. the only time.
look, after the block was settled in,
there were some drinks to celebrate.
now, the block going in is a big thing
because it's the base of a whole building.
and she came back
to the guesthouse.
she isn't what you would
call an oil painting,
but it was wet and cold, and
she talked about being lonely
and i talked about being happy.
but i'm lonely sometimes, you
know, when i was away, and...
and there was this wine and, um...
this was the only time i did
this in all our 15 years.
and now tonight she's giving birth.
tonight she's giving
birth and it's mine.
(line disconnects)
(sighs)
(exhales)
(car phone ringing)
ivan locke.
yeah, it's gareth, ivan.
i just spoke to donal.
this had better be more than good!
hello, gareth.
speak to me only about
tomorrow morning, ivan.
right, well...
um...
i won't be on site for
the pump tomorrow.
oh! sweet monkey jesus!
this is not happening.
uh, the truth is, tonight i'm
going to become a father.
and she's in london,
so i have to be there.
okay, okay.
jesus! i'm just gonna
read you something, ivan.
- are you listening?
- yes.
"good luck tomorrow with the pour.
"we just had it confirmed by cgo
"that this will be the
biggest single concrete pour
"ever made in europe outside
of nuclear military projects.
"i know the day is in the safest
of hands. best wishes, mitchell."
that is mitchell dean himself, the
president of the whole fucking company.
did you hear that, ivan?
from chicago, usa.
yes.
you're gonna have to speak
up, ivan. i can't hear you.
yes, i heard.
and so, you're the man in
charge of the entire operation,
but with 10 hours to go, you've
decided you ain't gonna be there!
well, donal will handle
it and he's a good man.
don't you fucking
dare say that to me!
(sniffles)
don't you fucking dare give
qualitative appraisals on my staff
and say "good man," like he's going
off to buy a fucking ice cream!
jesus, this is fucking concrete.
like shit, ivan. like piss.
when it comes, you pump it.
like babies.
shit. this is a joke to you.
no, no. right now nothing
is a joke anymore.
oh, god!
and so, it's not your
wife giving birth?
no.
- oh, jesus!
- it's someone else.
ivan! you're the last
person on earth...
yes, i know, i am the last person
on earth, but it happened.
and this woman, she can't just...
she can't give birth on her own?
i have made a decision.
there is nobody else who
could be with her, okay?
she has no friends in london
and is quite a fragile person.
fragile!
you're gonna abandon the biggest
fucking concrete pour in europe
to hold someone's fucking
hand because she's fragile?
and because the baby
was caused by me.
- (exclaiming)
- that is my decision i have made.
i have not behaved in the right
way with this woman at all.
i have behaved in a way
that isn't like me.
but now i am going to
do the right thing.
what, and chicago can
go to fucking hell?
it is a decision that i have made.
i'm not gonna turn back.
do you know how many millions of
pounds are riding on tomorrow?
if any one of those
pumps fucks up, ivan,
we are facing 10 million pounds
worth of losses in 15 minutes.
so if we get that 15 minutes
for the whole morning,
a total shutdown,
$100 million.
- are you still there, ivan?
- yes, yes.
look, i have no explanation.
apart from the one
that i've given you.
but, gareth, listen...
i have made a pledge to myself that i
will not allow the pour to fuck up.
oh! this is a joke!
are you wearing a
fucking red nose?
this is a fucking joke, ivan.
i'm gonna call chicago, right?
if it weren't for the fact that you've
been so solid for us for so many years,
i'd fire you down the phone.
oh, ivan, have you lost
your fucking mind?
i have made my decision.
(disconnects line)
what the fuck are you looking at?
you're laughing, aren't you?
laughing at my predicament.
it's a familiar predicament to a
man like you, isn't it, dad, eh?
you think, "there he is, look.
like father, like son.
"there's the man i made."
what is it they say?
"the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree."
well, that's where you're wrong.
listen to me, you fucking
piece of worthless shit.
i want you to watch.
do you know, in fact, i would
like to take a fucking shovel
and dig you up out of the fucking
ground and make you watch me tonight.
i would pull open your eyes
and kick the mud and worms and
shit out of your fucking ears
just for the duration
of this journey.
because it's me driving.
me, not you.
and, unlike you, i will drive straight
to the place where i should be,
and i will be there
to take care of my...
to take care of my fuck-up.
(car phone ringing)
yes, donal.
okay, okay, i'm driving back
now so i'm gonna be quick.
um, i called ryan and i got
half a dozen poles off him,
- and i got some hungarians from patrick.
- hmm.
i've got breakfast tickets
for the concrete farmers,
and the shutter boys are done, apart
from the fucking-about with the clips.
i've asked albanian alby to test
the pumps on the argyll side,
and he said that they're
pissing it out.
no, listen... okay,
stop, stop, stop.
listen, when you get back on site,
you check every pump yourself,
individually and with your
own hand on the turner.
you don't ask anybody else
to check and sign off.
you go around the whole site and
you check each one yourself.
and you don't trust alby after
- okay, okay.
- now, will you talk to me about the mix?
the mix... um, yeah, the mix.
did we say c6?
oh, don't say that
like it's a question.
okay, yes, okay.
sometimes i say things and it sounds
like a question and it's not a question.
well, all the mixes for the pump
will be c6. why do you even ask?
- it's written on the whiteboard...
- i'm not asking.
in fucking giant letters. i put "c6"
all over the cabin in big red letters.
- slump of one inch, c6.
- okay.
don't ask me questions like that.
i'm not asking a question.
i know you don't like questions.
(chuckles lightly) fucking hell!
all right, what time
are you unlocking?
i don't know. i'm gonna
sleep here tonight.
good, good, except you don't
sleep, okay? check everything.
you've got the client sign-off?
yeah, yeah, and the client
sign-off on the gates.
that's what i mean,
the gate sign-off.
donal, the construction sign-off
should already be filed.
yes, it is, it is. it's already... it's already
filed, it's okay. that's what i meant.
okay, right. well, you have the phone
numbers of the plants, don't you?
- (sighing) yeah.
- call them now, donal.
call every one of those bastards,
get them to repeat the order.
c6 on the nose or we
send those trucks back.
seriously, those fuckers
will fuck you up
with the water in the gullies
if it rains tomorrow.
well, it's not gonna rain
tomorrow. it's gonna be dry.
(chuckles)
i've got a direct line to
god up in heaven, you know.
donal, you don't trust god
when it comes to concrete.
you call the plants, donal,
- every one of them.
- i will, okay.
and get them to fax the order
back so you can check it.
i will. i'll do that. i'll do that now.
did you speak to gareth?
yes, i did, actually.
he's calling chicago.
i'm guessing chicago's going to fire me and
he'll put some fucking kid on it, so...
- oh, no, no, no.
- don't take his calls.
just don't take his calls.
- don't listen to anybody else.
- well, i can't not take his calls.
don't take his calls. don't listen to
anybody else until the morning.
this is me and you, okay?
so, i'm not gonna answer his calls?
no. just me and you
till the morning, okay?
- okay.
- cool.
- fucking hell, okay.
- (disconnects line)
(line ringing)
(over voicemail) hello. this is bethan.
i'm afraid i can't get to the phone.
(car phone ringing)
- bethan: did you call?
- are you okay?
uh, yeah. someone
closed the windows.
did you talk to anyone
about the pain?
- no, no one's been in.
- but is everything all right?
no. it hurts like nothing ever.
okay, well, i'm on the m6.
uh, an hour and a quarter
if the traffic stays okay.
you must speak to
someone about the pain.
um... just then i
felt like i hate you.
well, we don't know each other,
bethan. that's the simple truth.
- this thing just happened.
- thing?
so we can't really love each other
or hate each other, can we?
this thing just
happened and that's it.
and it will go up and down, i suppose,
but at least i'm coming, okay?
do you... do you hate me
for going through with it?
i don't know you, so... i don't
hate you, do i? i mean...
i don't know you, so...
look, do what they tell you to do.
i have a lot of calls to make.
the traffic is fine
so it'll be okay.
- please be quick.
- yes, but there's a speed limit.
(sirens blaring)
(car phone ringing)
- hello, gareth.
- yeah, look.
chicago is having a
predictable meltdown.
is it? okay.
yeah, i gave them, uh... i gave
them the whole 10-year thing
about your 10 years working for
park without a foot wrong.
nine years. um, i've been
with you nine years.
- what?
- nine years.
yeah, the whole thing, ivan.
he said he goes on emotion.
he said the stuff about the
biggest pour in europe.
outside the nuclear and
military, i know, i know.
(gareth sighs)
well, i'll tell you what, ivan...
you're fired, is what it is.
they said they had no choice. i said...
um, i told them about the 10 years.
- nine years.
- but they said they had no choice.
yeah. nine, 10, whatever.
so it's okay. it's okay.
- i never do this on the phone, ivan.
- it's okay. it's okay.
i will still make sure
the pour is all right.
no, ivan, it's... it's not
a matter for negotiation.
they've decided you're fired,
completely, as of right this second.
i know, i heard you, and i
don't blame them, okay?
but i'm not trying to
keep my job. i just...
i just want the pour
to go okay tomorrow.
- ivan...
- listen to me. you listen to me.
i want the pour to go okay,
not because of the money.
i want it to go right for
myself and for the building.
right? and for the concrete.
i won't let it be pumped into the
wrong place. do you understand?
tonight and tomorrow, i will
stay on this and stay on this
and make sure the concrete
gets poured right.
ivan, listen, i told
them about the 10 years.
- fuck your 10 years.
- they weren't having any of it.
listen to me, gareth...
listen, gareth.
the concrete will come and i
will take care of it, okay?
i know i don't have a job anymore,
but i will do this anyway
as a favor to the building
and to the concrete.
- ivan, you sound different.
- i am the same.
why didn't you just
say you were sick?
because i'm not sick, and i'll
make sure the pour is okay.
yeah, but i've already handed it over
to another construction director.
- ivan, he's gonna pick it up from...
- (disconnects line)
(car phone ringing)
(line connects)
katrina?
that didn't happen.
i'm not believing it.
katrina, i want to move
to a practical next step.
i'm here in the dark in our bedroom and...
oh, god, nothing looks the same.
ivan?
i can't... i can't speak
very well. i...
i have felt scraped-out for months.
she phoned and said that
she was having a baby
and keeping it because it was
her last chance to be happy.
and then tonight she phoned and said the
waters broke and it's two months early.
i was... i was going to tell you
before, but the waters broke early,
so i have to do this
now in the car.
- every night i was... i was going to tell you.
- god, i can't...
i can't really breathe.
katrina, listen. you know what
happened with my dad, right?
and how that bastard
wasn't around for me.
- didn't even give me a fucking name.
- no, no, you're confused.
ivan, it's you that's the bastard.
it's the baby that's the bastard.
for god's sake, ivan, at
least get the word right.
katrina, listen.
no, i will give the baby my
name and it will see my face.
it will know and it won't
spend its life thinking...
you know, thinking that nobody...
(breathing heavily) i've closed
the door and i'm in the dark,
and i'm almost sure this isn't you.
(tearfully) please don't be you.
i know, i should have said
all this a long time ago.
i'm so...
i have behaved not
at all like myself.
- (sobbing) i suppose i gotta get up.
- katrina, please, don't go.
- i have to throw up again.
- please, don't...
(line disconnects)
(car phone ringing)
- donal?
- okay. uh, ivan?
this isn't a question.
this isn't a question, okay?
but i just got off the phone
with the plant in stafford,
and they said they know
that it's a c6 mix,
but how far towards c5 can it go?
in other words, if one
truck had some c5,
how bad would that be taken?
are you still there?
donal, what does it say
on the whiteboard?
on the... it says c6.
what does it say on every piece of
paperwork and on every sign-off sheet?
- it says c6.
- i says c6.
and you know why?
because, eventually, when my building
is complete, it will be 55 floors high.
it will weigh 2,223,000
metric tons.
okay? my building will alter the
water table and squeeze granite.
it will be visible
from 20 miles away.
at sunset, it will cast a
shadow probably a mile long.
now, if the concrete at the base
of my building is not right,
if it slips half an
inch, cracks appear.
right? if cracks appear, then they
will grow and grow, won't they?
- and the whole thing will collapse.
- ivan, look...
you make one mistake, donal,
one little fucking mistake,
and the whole world comes
crashing down around you.
do you understand?
so you tell stafford, c6.
- c6 it is.
- thank you.
(line ringing)
- kat, please, listen.
- eddie: hey, dad.
- what?
- yeah, we're 1-nil down.
is, uh... is your mother there?
damn.
mum.
- sean, will you go and get mum?
- sean: i'm watching the match.
eddie: stupid penalty. are
you listening on the radio?
- sean: is that dad?
- no. no.
tell him they've scored.
eddie: um, dad, she's
on the toilet, i think.
- eddie...
- yeah?
- what?
- uh... it's okay. don't worry about it.
uh, it's fine. listen, i'll, uh... i'll
talk to you when it all settles down, okay?
- all right.
- okay.
- cool. bye, dad.
- bye, eddie. bye-bye.

ivan locke.
hello, this is sister margaret
from st. mary's maternity unit.
is everything okay?
i'm with bethan maguire.
is it your partner?
uh, i am the father.
she's quite distressed,
and we were wondering if someone
was gonna be with her for the birth.
she said she doesn't
have anyone else.
uh, yes. i'm an hour away,
i think, if the traffic's okay.
is she all right?
- well, there's a complication.
- what is the complication?
it's a complication with
the umbilical cord,
and it means there will be a procedure,
and it would help if dad was around.
- you are dad?
- yes, yes, i am.
i'm, uh... i'm driving.
i'm, uh... i'm doing 90.
oh. well, please don't drive
dangerously or anything.
i won't. listen, i will
be there very shortly.
good. okay, well, she's with
the consultant at the moment.
i just wanted to make
sure someone was coming.
uh, yes, well,
i will, i'll be there.
good. so what you need to do
is use the emergency entrance
- and ask for bailey ward.
- bailey? okay, i will do.
she's very emotional.
well, she isn't used to
being emotional, i think.
i think she's normally
a very quiet person.
- you are her partner?
- i am the father.
i don't, um...
i don't know her too well, if you
want the truth. but i'm coming.
- she's very afraid.
- i understand that.
- i'm driving.
- (disconnects call)
(car phone ringing)
yes, donal.
right, i've checked all the 12 pumps
myself and they're all pissing it out.
- good. you are testing with c6?
- yes, yeah, i see only c6.
- and you called all the plants?
- yeah, i called all the plants.
and just so you know, they all
gave me dog's abuse for checking.
excellent, and they have the
trucks lined up and the mix is in?
yes, yeah, yeah. i ticked off each response
after all the fuck-yous and piss-offs,
- and it came to 6,500 cubic meters.
- okay. what about the retardant?
the retardant's on site already,
ready to go into the trucks.
- good. now, do you have a pen?
- (sighs)
i have a pencil.
well, get a pen.
okay, i have a pen.
- (clears throat)
- good. now, in the top right-hand drawer
above the blow-heater,
you'll find my folder.
get it. it's going to
be your bible tonight.
- okay.
- (rattling)
- i don't see any folder.
- yes, no, it's there. it's there.
okay? it's got everything that
you're going to need in there.
right? all the numbers, the
sign-offs, the road closures
that you have to confirm
with the police.
now, it's in the drawer
above the blow-heater.
well, the blow-heater was taken
by the fucking hungarians.
you'd think they'd be used
to the cold, wouldn't you?
donal, you do know which
drawer that i mean, right?
it's not here. i've
checked all the drawers.
well, it is...
ah, fuck.
what? what?
- oh, fuck off.
- what? me?
no, not you. i have it here. shit!
all the things you are going to need,
and i have it fucking here in my car.
well, i've never...
you know, ivan, in all the
i've never... i've never known
you to fuck up like this.
what the fuck's going on?
okay, donal, um...
will you just give me
some time to think?
fuck!
(car phone ringing)
are you okay?
katrina: okay? okay?
kat, please. just hear
what i want to say...
(furiously) of all the things in the
world, i never thought of you doing this!
- katrina, don't let the boys hear.
- you fucked some girl.
- quietly, quietly.
- you fucked her and then me.
i looked at my diary and i checked.
i remember when you got home
from croydon that weekend,
and you had a big stupid
grin on your face.
the block was in.
i was happy with it.
- and i sit in the dark.
- it was once.
once! (scoffs)
the difference between once
and never is the whole world.
the difference between never and once
is the difference between good and bad.
- i know that.
- you don't know.
- i know.
- no, you don't know anything.
i know.
yeah, yeah, no. you had a
big stupid grin that night.
it was work. the block was down.
- you fucked someone.
- it was an odd night.
there wasn't really a bad
thought in anybody's head.
- you had a big fucking grin.
- that isn't it.
yeah, like you'd won something.
i remember you smiling and
putting your coat on the stairs.
i thought you'd won something.
i was trying to be normal.
i can't remember. look,
the block was in.
and that stuff about the baby.
you think she's having a baby?
yes, she's having the baby tonight.
oh, is she?
(laughing)
oh, forget that. you're a clown.
forget that. you're a stupid clown.
you think it's yours?
why would it be yours
if she fucks everybody?
she doesn't.
oh, if she fucks you,
she fucks everybody.
she isn't like that. she had
given up on having anything.
(tearfully) i can't believe it's me and you
and we're talking about somebody else.
like somebody broke
into the house. i just...
(sighs)
(sobbing) i can't...
i want to talk about a
practical next step.
did you say she's not like that?
you were with her one
night and you know her?
automated voice:
you have a call waiting.
she doesn't do that.
she hadn't for years.
okay? afterwards she was sad.
(katrina exhales sharply)
did you say sad?
- (laughs)
- (line disconnects)
(car phone ringing)
- yes?
- donal: i think we got cut off.
shit. okay, yes.
i have the file here.
hang on a second.
(inhales deeply)
okay, i have the file here.
- right.
- i'm going to have to give you
some information over the phone,
and you're going to have
to write it down, okay?
(laughing) okay.
donal, are you drinking something?
what are you drinking?
um... a nice bottle of fizzy pop.
okay, i need you to call the duty
officer at belmount police station
and confirm some road closures
for the morning, okay?
do you still have the pen?
- uh... oh, yeah.
- right, okay.
here are the roads we
agreed with the council
that need to be closed to traffic
for the duration of the pour,
which is from 5:25 a.m. to midday.
yeah, okay, go.
crescent road between arch
green and claremount.
crescent road between arch
green and claremount.
- planetree road at the south end only.
- planetree road at the south end only, yeah.
the vale up to parklands farm road.
- okay, yeah.
- but with the stop-go operated by us.
yeah, got that.
you'll need to quote the
license number 750...
- 750.
- ...slash dv. okay?
slash dv. cool. okay. got it.
good. donal?
- it is fizzy pop that you're drinking, yes?
- it is.
it is. it is.
because if you are on the
fucking cider and i find out,
i will cut your legs off
with a fucking pavement saw.
(laughs) will you? right. now,
ivan... ivan, listen to me.
there's no need for you to
talk to me like that, okay?
because i've got six calls
here that i'm looking at
stacked up on this phone from gareth,
and i'm guessing what they are
and what he's saying to
me on the phone calls.
but i agreed that i'm not gonna
take those phone calls from gareth
because i'm fucking shitting my pants here,
you know, about tomorrow going pear,
and i don't want him to give me some
fucking college kid on the phone
trying to talk me through
this from scratch.
so, as far as i'm concerned,
until the sun comes up,
yours is the only voice
i'm gonna listen to.
but hear this, (loudly)
don't fucking threaten me!
automated voice:
you have a call waiting.
okay? you have no official
position now to threaten me from,
so don't fucking threaten me!
so it is cider that
you're drinking?
one can of cider, yeah!
so fucking what?
eat something.
do you know what? i'm not actually
that hungry at the moment.
okay, now let me get these
calls to these fucking coppers
and confirm the road closures,
and then i'll call you back
for further instructions.
over and fucking out.
(line disconnects)
fuck!
(horn honking)
(tires screeching)
(car phone ringing)
right.
ivan locke.
bethan: they say there's a twist.
a what?
it's round the baby's
neck like a noose.
well, you're in the best place. honestly,
you are. you're in the best place.
they let me use my
phone for one minute.
(bethan moaning)
(breathes deeply)
- when will you get here?
- about 45 minutes.
i'm outside northampton.
the traffic is okay.
it's like waiting for god, or...
waiting for godot. (chuckles)
sony, you're not a theater man.
and not a reader of
books and not a talker.
a builder. funny, isn't it?
(bethan groans)
it's funny it was someone like
you, someone so opposite to me.
all the things i love mean
absolutely zero to you.
the important thing is
to get the baby out.
well, ooh, the news is,
they're resorting to knives.
(laughing)
well, by the sound of you, they're
giving you gas, are they?
yeah, they think they
might have to cut me open
because i'm too old to push.
that's okay, that's okay. they
do that as a routine. it's okay.
it's better, in fact.
- oh, "in fact"? is that so?
- (coughing)
yes. the traffic is okay.
- they're taking blood.
- (blowing nose)
well, just do what they say.
and someone keeps
opening the window.
tell them you're cold.
they talk around me. i need
someone here to speak for me.
they said the umbilical
cord is like a noose.
a lifeline and a noose at the
same time. it's funny, isn't it?
bethan... bethan...
bethan?
(line disconnects)
oh, jesus.
you think this is all
fate, don't you, dad?
your dirty fucking
fingerprints all over me.
you thought it was bound to happen because
of the little seeds that you planted.
okay, well, let me educate you.
even no matter what the situation
is, you can make it good,
like with plaster and brick.
you never knew that because you never
lifted a finger, you fucking lazy cunt.
but you know what?
you can take a situation
and you can draw a circle around it
and find a way to
work something out.
you don't just drive away from it.
no. or sit in the corner of some
greasy little fucking pub somewhere
like you're the fucking
happy little maverick.
ivan: i could come for you with a
pick and a shovel, i really could,
and dig you up and it would
be a happy day in hell
because they would be
rid of you for a bit.
you know what? i could
just drive around the m25
and head to dover or some-fucking-
where and not face it, couldn't i?
just earn good money, cash in
hand, working on the crossrail.
they make 500 a day
just shoveling shit,
shoveling shit about like you.
no, i'm going to drive straight
to the worst place for me,
the worst place on earth for me to be,
even though this woman is like...
she's, like, sad and lonely,
hardly bothered with life at all.
i felt sorry for her, you know?
i felt sorry for her.
so, how can that be the
difference between good and bad?
hmm?
(line ringing)
eddie: (shouting) yeah!
yeah, that was wicked! dad,
are you listening to this?
in three minutes.
dad, seriously, you gotta put
it on the radio. it's brilliant.
- (chuckles)
- is your mother there?
um, no, she's upstairs
on the toilet.
she's been in there ages.
she's wearing the shirt,
but she won't come down.
um, do you want me to call her?
no, no, just leave her.
it's, uh... it's okay.
go on, you enjoy the game.
why aren't you going mad?
i am, eddie, i'm going mad inside.
but i'm driving and i'm, uh...
(disconnects line)
(inhales deeply)
(line ringing)

i was wondering if anyone had
called you about road closures.
(blowing nose)
um, yeah, we had some irish
guy. said he was standing in.
good, yes. i'm just double-checking
the closures are all confirmed, yes?
uh... uh, one minute.
no, there's, um...
there's a problem
- with the vale stop and go.
- what?
there's a problem with
the vale stop and go.
shit!
the council, they've questioned
the license at the last minute.
- oh, shit.
- so...
i was gonna call
them in the morning.
- well, it's too late.
- i'm sorry?
we have to control the road to get the
trucks in and out of the south gate.
well, i'm sorry, mr. locke.
you'll have to take that
up with the council.
- but it's 9:00.
- yeah.
well, the council offices
are closed, aren't they?
that's right, but i can't ratify until
the council sign off on the stop and go.
okay, no, i understand.
okay, i understand.
you'll get a call. how
long are you on duty for?
automated voice:
you have a call waiting.
well, you've got
another 25 minutes.
okay, look, you'll get a call,
okay? you'll get a call.
- (disconnects line)
- (car phone ringing)
donal: ivan, we have a
problem with the stop and go.
i know, i just heard.
i'm dealing with it.
in the meantime, i need you to
go and check the shuttering
and get it signed off.
no, the shuttering boys
have all gone home.
oh. even so, you still have to go
and check the rebars, don't you?
go and do it now. take a shovel
and a pressure meter and a
torch and get into the holes.
- jesus. jesus.
- i mean it.
okay, but if this is just to stop me
drinking, you can fuck right off.
listen, i'm hoping your conscience
will stop you drinking.
the shuttering has to be checked.
go... go and do it. go.
(line ringing)
- sean: hello?
- sean, it's dad.
dad, i can't believe you're
not here. it's amazing. 2-1.
i know, i know. sean, um...
(coughing) sorry.
sean, i need you to do me a favor.
- there's, um...
- automated voice: you have a call waiting.
there's been a cock-up at work
and i need to speak to someone.
in my blue coat in the kitchen,
yes? there's a notebook.
there's a phone number in the
notebook of somebody called cassidy
who works for the council clerk
of works. i need the number.
- why don't you ask mum?
- please... sean, please.
just get the number. text it to me.
cassidy. it's under
it's very urgent.
dad, is mum all right?
she hasn't come down.

(line disconnects)
(car phone ringing)
man:
hello. can i speak to ivan locke?
this is ivan locke.
i'm dr. halil gullu. i'm the senior
obstetrician at st. mary's hospital.
automated voice:
you have a call waiting.
we have a bethan maguire here
who's given us this number as
the number of her next of kin.
- are you her next of kin?
- what's happening?
i'm sorry. are you the next of kin?
- i am the father.
- excuse me. hang on.
i'll deal with that.
mr. locke, i'm sorry,
we have a situation here
where the baby's umbilical cord is
wrapped around the baby's neck.
- yes, i know. yes.
- and the baby is very distressed.
and you're going to
carry out a cesarean.
yes, that's right, but miss maguire says
she wants to wait until you are here.
ah, well, she's distressed. she's
quite an odd person, i think.
look, if we're gonna get her to cooperate,
i really need you to speak to her.
of course you do, absolutely.
go on, put her on.
thank you very much.
please hold the line.
(siren blaring)
- bethan.
- bethan: they want to do it now.
right, well, let them do it.
i've said let them do it.
it doesn't matter if i'm not there
for the moment of the birth
because i will still be
there in the morning,
uh, before morning, in fact,
and it will still be the same day.
- where are you?
- i'm on the motorway.
luton. now, you let them
do it and don't be silly.
fuck you!
ivan, you know i told
them it was one night.
i told them about the room
and feeling so sad after.
- yes.
- but the nurse said,
"if he's coming all this way
down, he must feel something."
- if it was just once and i get pregnant...
- you're distressed.
it's fate.
i told them i love you,
even if it was just once.
well, there's no need to say that.
- (tearfully) and it'll be ours.
- yes.
(sobs)
how far away are you?
bethan.
now, a baby is something
that cannot be stopped.
you have to take all the
practical steps to prepare.
- you want me to let them cut me open.
- yes. i mean, it is the best thing.
okay. i'll do it
because i love you.
okay, then.
can you not say it back, even once?
no, i can't. look... i can't.
but i can be there as fast
as the traffic will allow.
(car phone ringing)
katrina: ivan, i just found sean
looking through your pockets.
- he said you asked him for a phone number.
- yes.
now, at this moment, you
need a phone number?
i know how it looks, but i need to...
i need to confirm a stop and go.
tomorrow there's a pour.
it's a big... it is historical.
- it is the biggest pour in europe.
- can you hear yourself, ivan?
i'm falling apart at home
and you're closing roads?
it's not a closure,
it's a stop and go.
the woman is giving birth
and you're closing roads.
since you've told me
about this woman,
you have been getting further and
further away from who i know.
no, actually, it might
be that i do know.
in the... in the kitchen,
your footprints, they go hard
and i have to chip them away.
you leave concrete
behind you everywhere.
katrina, i love you.
okay? i made one mistake.
i don't feel anything
for this woman...
(katrina sobbing)
and i'm trying to do the
right thing tonight,
because she is on her own
and the baby is my fault.
and i know how it feels to be coming
out into the world like this.
there is someone being brought
into the world and it's my fault.
- so i have to fix it, somehow.
- (scoffs) oh, my god.
i would really like it if you would say
that you will wait and i can come back
and we can talk...
we can talk about it
and that we can fix something up.
i really want to know that
tomorrow i can drive home
and talk to the boys and
be at home as normal,
and we can go out or something and
have a drink and talk about it.
i want to know that i am not
driving in one direction...
i want to know that i will be
driving back when the sun comes up.
ivan, let me ask you a question.
do you still want me to give you the
phone number so you can close the road?
yes.
right, well, goodbye, ivan.
(line disconnects)
(car phone ringing)

something on my own initiative.

i found the mobile number for the
council guy who signs off the closures.

- yeah, cassidy. that's him.
you found his number?
yeah, i have his mobile number.
i knew you'd need it.

(sighing) uh-huh. i remember

yes, yes, but tonight, i'm
sorry, things have just...
they've happened beyond my control.
okay, okay, okay.
- give me the bloody number.
- thank you.
okay. 07957-452...
you know, i could have easily
let the concrete go to hell,
but i didn't.
you know, dad, when you came creeping
back, saying you were sorry,
it was even worse
than staying away.
yes, i'm serious.
i could have broken your fucking
back for that, but i didn't.
and the fact that i could have done it
was worse than anything, you know?
because you were so fucking weak.
that was the first thing
i noticed. so weak.
all the things i fucking despise
inside one fucking stupid green shirt.
ivan: you looked pathetic.
my fucking dad in... what
were they? they were trainers.
they were some son' of fucking
trainers that teenagers wear.
and your hair was
all over the place.
you don't drink anymore and
you don't fucking smoke dope.
we're all supposed to celebrate, is
that it? celebrate what, exactly?
- (car phone ringing)
- i was 23 years old
and this old cunt comes
from the fucking blue sky.
he says, "guess what,
everybody. i've..."
- what?
- donal: ivan.
- what?
- ivan, it's all going to hell.
what?
the rebars in the shuttering in pit six,
they wouldn't hold a fucking kitten's fan'.
it's those mavericks from up north
we put in there at the last minute.
- what tension did they hold?
- they hold nothing!
they hold nothing at all.
it came away with a push.
is there anybody there?
no, shutterers all went home
ages ago. they're not in till 6:00.
- right, call the albanian.
- no, i've tried the albanian.
he's not answering. nobody's
answering. nobody's answering.
there's some fucking
football game on!
- could you call in your sons?
- (stammers) no, they're in germany.
- they're digging out missile silos.
- okay, okay, donal. here's what you do.
you drive down to the ring road
near the fire station, okay?
and you'll see a road
gang laying lines.
you ask for a guy called
stefan. he's polish.
tell him there's 500 pounds for
him and two of his best diggers
if they can get down and
fix up some rebars.
a road gang?
yes, i know. but i know
them. i know them.
they're slumming it for the cash. stefan
is the best concrete farmer i know.
now, you mention my
name. he owes me.
so, do i have to drive down there?
can i not just ring them?
donal, how many
ciders have you had?
donal?
donal, i don't have stefan's number.
you'll need to drive down there.
they'll be knocking off and going
home in, like, half an hour.
okay, ivan, i'm gonna
be straight with you.
i'm not drunk.
i'm not drunk, okay, but i've had
too much to get behind a wheel.
if i get stopped
again, i go inside.
and i can't do that.
okay, then you run.
- i run?
- yeah.
stefan and his men will knock off in
half an hour due to council regulations
because they can't burn
bitumen lights after 10:00.
so if you run, you'll get there
before they get in their van.
what do you mean, run?
i'm not gonna fucking run.
you will fucking run, donal.
- i haven't... i'm not...
- you will fucking run now.
go, or my building won't get built.
(donal laughing)
- are you mad?
- yes.
- run? i'm not...
- yes, i'm mad.
tonight i've gone mad and i will
have to get used to being mad.
automated voice:
you have a call waiting.
and donal...
- i can hear in your voice when you're drunk.
- i'm not.
no, but when you're drunk,
you can run faster, can't you?
for a while at least. you
can run like a fucking kid.
- you can run like the fucking wind.
- (laughing)
so i'm gonna get out of my
boots and put on my trainers?
- my run-fast trainers?
- yes, yes. then you run.
so you want me to run? run for
those fucking bastards in chicago
who don't give a shit
if i live or if i die?
no, you do it for the piece of sky
we are stealing with our building.
you do it for the air
that will be displaced,
and most of all you do it
for the fucking concrete.
because it is delicate as blood.
you really have gone
fucking mad, right?
well, that would be a
fair assessment, yes.
(laughing) all right.

- oh, you're a good man, donal.
you are, you're a good man.

it will work out.
i will make sure of it.
you'll see. you'll see.
you see, you take things
in your own hands,
and you push against it and you
push against it until it's upright.
and you stick to the plan.

you have to be solid
so that it makes no
difference what they think.

bury you tonight, again,
before i threw dirt on your face,
i would say, "look.
"look and fucking learn."
i drove in this direction
and there will be a new
person when i get there.

wine and somebody feeling lonely.

explained it to myself.
she said you're not
coming home ever.

they're burning.
oh, my god. they're
burning the road.

got the poles in my... fuck!
in my grasp, okay?
jesus, my heart's coming out...
(disconnects line)
stefan is a good man.
he will fix the pit and check the
others. all 12 pumps will work.
the stop-go will run.
the north, south, east and west gates
will all take their quarter of concrete.
the baby will be born.
and katrina will be okay.
in the morning she will be okay.
that is how it can be.
that is my prayer.
and when the baby is born,
when he's seven or
when she's seven,
it'll say it's okay.
and the name will be locke.
oh, locke is okay. we do okay.
because... because i
straightened the name out.
the lockes were a long line of shit,
but i straightened the name out.
you know what, you old bastard?
you know what? i know now.
- i know now why you ran away.
- (car phone ringing)
yeah?
donal: okay, okay, okay.
i'm in a van with three poles
who smell like fucking
burning rooftops.
and they said 600, right, so i
guess you're gonna say yeah?
- yes.
- yeah, good, okay.
this guy stefan, he doesn't
say much, does he?
- well, no, but he's a good man.
- you want a word with him?
no. stefan knows what to do.
you'll be okay now, donal.
- yeah, yeah.
- you fix up the rebars
and start preparing the gates.
- okay.
- it will be a long night.
jesus, i'm stone-cold sober now.
(laughs)
i know. i know. it all worked out.
- what?
- i said...
wait, wait, wait... stefan
just said, "say hello."
he said, "say hello to ivan locke."
(laughs)
what? oh, right.
he says...
he says to say you're the
best man in england.
(donal laughing)
(line disconnects)
(car phone ringing)
- katrina: ivan?
- yes.
i've decided.
kat, you know what? we can
work this out. i know we can.
no, no, no. i've spoken to my
sister and my half-sister.
and the difference between
once and never is everything.
so, that's it. and it
never is once anyway.
- katrina, listen...
- i don't want you to come back, ivan.
this is not your home anymore
and i want you to stay away.
katrina, please, listen.
we will make arrangements
for seeing the boys.
but, look, i... i don't
want you coming here.
you were always more in love
with your buildings anyway.
why don't you go and
live in one of them?
i mean, right at the top
where you like to look out
and feel so pleased with yourself.
hey, i'm gonna wash
everything here,
wash it all out 10 times to get
the dust of you out of it.
i won't have to deal
with your footprints
turning to stone on the
kitchen floor anymore.
(katrina sobbing)
it's finished. this
isn't your home.
(line disconnects)
(rattling)

(car phone ringing)
ivan locke.
gareth: ivan, i've put a
construction director onto this.
he's tried to reach donal 100
times, but donal isn't picking up.
are you there, ivan?
yes.
look, can you reach donal and tell him
he's got to pick up his phone immediately?
ivan?
tell your construction director
there's no need to speak to donal.
everything's already taken care of.
- ivan, for fuck's sake, i can't do this.
- everything is taken care of
and everything is ready for 5:25.
- there will be no mistakes.
- automated voice: you have a call waiting.
i have made sure of everything and
i've made sure everything is in place.
you can go to sleep now,
gareth. good night.
you know, i actually
threw up earlier.
- yeah?
- fucking yeah.
well, hear this, gareth.
when i left the site
just over two hours ago,
i had a job, a wife, a home.
and now i have none of those things.
i have none of those things left.
i just have myself and
the car that i'm in.
and i'm just driving and that's it.
ivan, you fucked up your
life, that's your business,
but chicago is going insane.
hmm.
two words i learned tonight.
fuck chicago.
(car phone ringing)
(over voicemail) this is ivan
locke. please leave a message.
hey, dad. um, it's eddie.
i'm on my mobile.
i'm under the duvet.
i, um... i just wanted to
tell you about the goal.
(eddie laughs)
caldwell got it in and he
controlled it, you know?
you know how you shout at him because
it always flies off into the crowd?
yeah, he controlled it and he
got it down on the ground,
and you know how you say he just
lumps it forward all the time?
well, he got it down on the ground.
this is caldwell,
dad, and he just...
he just started running
and running and running.
and... (laughs)
and these defenders were
just bouncing off him.
and he went round one
and then the other.
and me and sean were standing up
and shouting at him to pass the ball.
"pass the ball!"
you say you've got to square it.
he wouldn't square it.
he wouldn't pass.
he just... he just kept running.
he was... he looked like
a horse or something.
and then the goalie's
coming forward
and we think he's gonna
boot it over the bar, um...
remember against...
anyway, whoever it was.
and we thought he was gonna boot it
over the bar again, but he didn't.
this is caldwell, dad, the one
you say is always a donkey.
yeah.
he went round the
goalie and put it in.
mum was crying, so she
didn't even see it.
um, but we recorded it for you, so you
have to come home and watch it, okay?
you have to come home,
and i have an idea, okay?
so, we'll pretend we
don't know the score
and pretend it's happening
then, pretend it's live.
and me and sean will go mad all the
same, and you can have your beer
and mum can make the
sausages, so...
so, that's what we'll do.
good night, dad.
(line disconnects)
(car phone ringing)
bethan: ivan?
is everything okay?

(baby cooing)
(baby whining)
