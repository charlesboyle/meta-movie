on the fifteenth of may,
in the jungle of nool,
in the heat of the day,
in the cool of the pool,
he was splashing, enjoying
the jungle's great joys.
and horton, the elephant,
heard a small noise.
- horton!
- horton!
good morning, class.
are you ready?
yeah!
jump on board!
look out, below!
tommy's on board.
katie, you there?
- ha-ah-a.
- o.k.
there it is.
this is one of the jungle's
most amazing creatures.
the leaf bug.
in order to protect
itself from predators.
it disguises itself as a leaf.
this one's got
quite a deep grip.
come on, little buddy!
don't be shy!
i guess i was mistaken, kids.
there are obviously no
leaf bugs in this area.
- oh, yeah. - even a
per... oh! they're on me.
look at, there are bugs
i think i swallowed it.
shoot up! uh-ek
it's not coming.
pull it out.
uh, okay.
then, humphing her nose
was sour kangaroo.
a type who's convince she
knows better than you.
she made every law and
then forced every rule
as self conclaimed head of
the jungle of the nool.
why can't i play with
the other kids, mom?
how many times have i told you?
the jungle is no place to
act like a wild animal.
my, that horton
certainly is eccentric?
and that children are
learning so much from him.
learning to be a bunch a
hell brain half-wits.
and that's why my rudy
is pouch schooled.
so, while kangaroos still
there sneering a sneer.
horton, how it's the
best time of my life.
what are you gonna show us then?
once again the speck floated
right by horton's ear.
and he heard it again.
just a very faint yelp, as if some
tiny person were calling for help.
and you know what he thought?
what he thought there must be someone
on top of that small speck of dust.
or even a family. it
just might be so.
a family with children
just starting to grow.
i wanna live!
i got to go. katie,
you're in charge.
wait!
come back!
one more, one more,
one more, one more.
- ah here someone coming.
- get here those.
- wait!
- sound the alarm!
excuse me! on my stamp feet!
sorry, wickershams.
i promise i'm gonna clean
all this up later!
bring the arrow!
i love the smell of the
banana's in the morning.
bananing hou!
come on, guys!
we're all mammals!
whou!
i feel diplomatic process
is beginning to break down.
there you are.
i'll catch it. catch it.
- hi, kids.
- wow!
there.
now you're safe.
i know i heard you
say something.
i just know it.
where are you?
- horton?
- uhoo, sorry.
i just... ah.
there was this speck.
and the... they
called up for help.
- and i was...
- the speck...
called out for help?
well not the speck. i mean.
that's ridiculous.
is what you thought i've been?
no, the speck can't call
out for help. come on.
get real!
no.
there's tiny person on that
speck and needs my help.
absurd.
there aren't people that small.
whoa, maybe thay aren't small.
maybe...
we're big.
- horton!
- no! really, think about it.
what if there is someone
way out there,
looking down on our
world right now.
and to them, we are the speck.
and then this someone
else come along, he say,
"oh, there can't be
people that small."
and the first guy would say.
"are you calling me a liar?"
and the second guy would say.
"if the shoe fits wear it,
and now that fits a blind."
and the first guy
pick supper break.
and you might wanna zip up the
pouch for this next part.
alright, fat boy!
- you want some of there...
- horton?
there is nothing on that speck.
but i heard.
did you? really? oh my!
then how come i don't
hear anything.
well?
if you can't see, hear,
or feel something,
it doesn't exist.
believing in tiny imaginary people
is just not something we do.
or tolerate here in
the jungle of nool.
really?
'cause i verified i really tried
i can find somebody
- who believe what i'm saying. -
you will do nothing of the sort.
you will not breathe the word
of this lie to anyone else.
specially the children.
i do not want you poisoning
their minds with this nonsense.
our community has
standards, horton.
if you wanna remain a part of that,
i recommend you follow them.
have a nice day.
alright then!
i'll ah... take that an advice.
certainly appreciate your input.
i don't understand.
i know i heard you.
it was just clean
as nose on my face.
that's it.
maybe you can't hear me!
of course your
ears must be tiny.
i need to speak up!
h- e-l-l-o-w!
now some people out there
might think i know who
they find they agreed
with that sour kangaroo.
"there can't really be
people as small as a mice."
well there can. and there are.
becuase horton was right.
hellow!
that single "hellow"
traveled all the way down
to the speck, to the flowers,
to the fount of the small town.
the town known as whoville
for there live the whos.
really happy in safe,
knowing only good news,
unaware that their world
was a speck on a clover,
unaware the sweet life
they knew might be old.
the mayor of whoville
a man named mcdodd
who's devoted and faired
and little bit odd.
the mayor and his wife they
had children to spare.
here and some there.
but the mayors have only
few second for each.
daddy, i do better than
best on my whostory test.
ah, whostory. i remembered well.
that's one of my girls.
her is has been
using my hairbrush?
her is has been
using my hairbrush.
look, over there!
there, all better.
can i please have
whophone, daddy?
everyone else in
my class has one.
oh, really? everyone?
- aw! i will think about it.
- daddy, look! daddy look!
toos!
it's "th" sweetheart.
it's "tooth".
in whoville tradition,
unlike yours or mine,
mayor's oldest is the
next mayor of line.
and who was the oldest
lead and stand tall?
it was jojo, his son,
the smallest who all.
so, jojo, what's what's shaking?
what's happening?
what's the world?
now to you or to me,
it's finally clear
that jojo did not want
his father's career.
but the mayor pressed
forward completely illuded.
and jojo just sat there
in silence and lude it.
oh, jojo!
- hey! why this he get more
time? - that's not fair!
son! hey!
and why didn't he speak?
well i think the leg was
frightened if he did,
he might let down his dad.
you know what's awesome?
this is awesome!
just look at the men and the
women hanging on these walls.
you, my boy, are part of family
legacy that spans centuries.
you know what?
your grandfather was
mayor of whoville.
and, your great
grandmother, that's right.
all the way down to your.
great.
not so great.
great, great.
great, great, great.
great!
grandfather!
some day i hope to join them.
be one of the grates.
i tell you jojo there is
nothing like being mayor.
i get to sign resolutions, approve
ordinances, submit budgets.
and in the edible parade
i'm the one city noun top
of the giant people.
some day.
that can be you too, jojo.
some day you'll be the one
wearing the mayor crest.
you just...
you just need to...
you know what i mean?
o.k. good chat!
i'm glad that we had this talk.
that i'm continuing
now by myself. good.
oh! there. there
are to become fit.
nothing wrong with this morton.
nothing wrong with this.
just you and me in the speck.
shouldn't a breeze.
we're club. we're group.
we can take a vote on issues.
we can be a secret to society
- to control pirate's power
in the world. - horton?
and no one else can join.
unless they wear funny hats.
listen, horton!
the chair reconize
it's brother morton.
i am really happy you
found this speck in all.
but you might wanna think
about keeping it to yourself.
um, what, what?
are you talking to what clover.
that doesn't look good.
you know what doesn't look good?
you, talking about the speck
like the speck isn't even there.
speck never said
nothing bad about you.
but hey!
good luck with your
illusional superiority.
you know the speck can think anything
you want about me you to speak.
wow!
i see what's going on here.
morton, no matter how tight
this speck and i get,
the speck could
never replace you.
i'm only sad that i would have
to explain that at this point.
well, that's awesome horton.
that really helps.
just try to keep this to
yourself. i'll see you later.
try.
hey, horton? what's
you got in there?
what? nothing.
we're not doing anything.
who's we?
we? what we? did i say that?
i just... oh, no. i
would never say that
because that would a play that i
was with someone and not alone.
o.k. there is a story you
can't talk to anybody
i mean it.
if anybody finds out about this,
it could be very very bad.
i'm not sure why.
we won't tell anyone.
and if we do, we'll tell
them not to tell anyone.
perfect!
o.k.
i'm taking a bath, right.
'cause my skin gets kind a dry.
my roof asht.
while horton can clean about
the speck that he found.
how he'd save this what
at really drowned.
the mayor set off on
his morning commute
and noticed things not quite
the same on his route.
but please don't blame
horton for he didn't know.
that a swamp pump a bub
i do it in the water like this.
was a big bub flew.
hey, joe! don't work too hard!
ah! these luxery condos
they have gone themselves.
hey, you look at that. i guess
they do build themselves.
oh kei, that happened.
now the mayor knew
it was his job
to convey the unusual things
that he noticed that day.
there was one problem.
though his will was strong.
- you are late.
- thank you miss. yelp.
nothing in whoville
had ever gone wrong.
we have all happy be
with all the we've got.
we like it in here whoville.
we like it a lot.
we're all very busy with
who-centennial's coming up. so,..
let's break this
meeting to order.
mr. mayor i presume you
have some good news for us.
well, it's news. i don't know.
if we need to go label it good
or bad anything like that.
the thing is i have noticed some
odd goings on in whoville lately.
good on goings on?
well, you know. tremors,
clouds surly in the sky.
and it seems to me just be safe,
we might wanna consider...
pospo nin th whocentenia?
consider what?
pospo nin th whocentenia?
what?! speak up, man!
postponing the
who-centennial, alright?
we're about to celebrate 100 years
of whoville happiness in harmony.
and you want to postpone
the celebration?
well, what if
whoville's not safe.
nothing ever goes
wrong in whoville!
never has and never will!
you bloodly boob!
boob.
the who-centennial will
proceed as planned!
the mayor was really
being an idiot.
it will be all
smile from now on.
girl, i got 15,000
friends already.
what? what you mean it
don't look like me?
that look just like me.
ten years ago... wait a
minute, hold on for a second.
treats me like an idiot?
i'm not an idiot.
do i look like an idiot?
- you don't want me to answer
that. - i'm not an idiot.
that's nerve call me a boob?
i would never call
somebody a boob.
he is a boob.
look at you, yak.
look at your face.
and i bet.
you don't look so good with
this staple on your head!
wow!
wa-ha-au!
- thank you, miss. yelp.
- you're welcome.
oh!
hellow?
who's you that? i'll
go out punch you.
hellow?
hellow?
who's there?
i'm... this the mayor.
the mayor?
the mayor?
uh, look at this mayor!
i knew it.
i knew it. i knew it. i knew it.
there's life on this speck.
the speck? what speck?
well, am...
i don't exactly know how
to tell you this. but...
you're living on a speck.
well, i ee hate to
disagree with you.
oh, voice from the drain pipe.
but, i live in whoville.
well, then the
whoville is a speck.
right. o.k. seriously.
who is this?
is this bert from accounting?
no. this is horton.
i'm an elephant.
o.k. horton, fake name.
where are you?
well, from where you standing?
i guess i'm...
in the sky.
compare to you i'm enormous
which is saying something because
i slim down quite a bit i swim.
your whole world fits on
a flower in my world.
oh, man, this is even
inclusion for you bert.
don't believe me?
watch what happen when i
put you in the shade.
- this is absolutly impossi...
- dark.
light.
dark.
light.
- dark, light, dark,
light... dark! - wow!
- light!
- uooo.
don't you see?
we're in the middle of some kind
of amazing cosmic convergence.
two vastly different worlds.
miraculously crossing path!
mine colossal!
yours miniscule.
yet, somehow we've
managed to make contact.
if you think about it,
it's pretty amazing.
is everything o.k. down there?
oh. i.. i don't know.
you tell me...
you're the one
holding the speck.
i'm the one holding the speck.
i'm the one holding the speck...
don't you worry, mr. mayor.
am.
hold, please.
what on all this mean?
the mayor haven't the clue.
so he went to the
office of dr. larue.
brainiest brain on the
staff at who you.
dr. larue!
oh, this is crazy.
oh, mr. mayor.
ah, how may i be a assistance?
i don't know. hey.
you know i just wondering...
if our world was a tiny speck
floating to space,
how would we know?
oh, why would you ask
something like that?
oh, no reason, no reason at all.
i don't even remember.
yes i do.
you know what?
some guy was talking to me
not an elephant in the
sky, a guy on the ground.
ah, there would be
several ramifications.
good ramifications?
a tiny speck.
uh-huh, yeah, tiny speck.
floating around...
well, we'd have
inexplicable tremors.
dramatic changes in the weather.
and if we didn't eventually
achieve some sort of stability
our world would be destroyed.
destroyed!
destroyed, oh destroyed.
horton?
ah, no. this is danny.
horton is busy right now.
i'm joking. that's me.
ah, we're doomed.
listen, horton!
turns out i need your
help a little bit.
apparently if that speck
keeps moving around,
our whole world could
be obliterated.
so...
i need you to find us, the who's, a
safer, more stable home and fast.
no problem, mr. mayor.
let's see...
wow!
that's a nice view.
hello, is everything okay?
what's going on up there?
this entire jungle
is a house of death!
oh, wait.
there's a good spot.
and it's when horton saw
at the top of mount nool
a small cave that looked
peaceful and quiet, and cool,
where a sun flower grew proud
and tall from the ground.
there he knew every
who would be safe,
would be sound.
i found it mayor.
the perfect place.
right up there.
- on the top of the mount nool.
- mr. mayor?
- yeah?
- i wish we could...
oh-ho, ah, shiny. ah-ha.
the who-centennial committee
is waiting for you
to look over the giantly
bar for the edible parade.
oh, and then you will do at the
dinners for your whowill canal.
you know, sticking who in front of
everything, doesn't make it hurt less.
just waste time!
i don't wanna go.
listen, horton. i got to go.
apparently there's a
problem with the meatball.
you just take care of
that meatball, sir.
and leave the
freaking out to me.
so, then horton began
his long paraless track
determined to save the
small world on the speck.
horton was faithful and
soul working kind.
i got ya.
he was a brave hero.
i'll protect ya.
at least in his mind.
we must become invisible.
travel silently.
for there are forces that
would seek to destroy us.
hee-ha-ah-aaaaa-ah!
ah-a?!
so, you think you can
stick upon me, huh!
e- yab! ah-dadada!
it's clear that you're no
match for my ticky kei!
oh. ha-a.
i see you have mastered the
way of the soaping branch.
watch me tumble!
horton! let's go!
mother kangaroo has monkeys.
i wll make monkeys
of these monkeys.
it is their destiny, huh-uh!
hoi-yat! my tumble! my tumble!
- oh - horton is the greatest
hero of them all, ha!
horton! horton! go!
ah... hu!
oh, mount nool is that way!
hahaha!
to the top of the mount nool.
as fast as lightning.
ha-it!
oh, sorry little fella.
you'll be fine.
just the killing thoughts.
- horton!
- horton!
- look!
- go go go!
we've all got own clovers
with worlds on them.
yeah!
oh!
in my world everyone's pony
and they all eat rainbows
and poop butterflies.
that's beautiful, katie.
in a really weired way.
my world is called jessicaland.
everyone worships queen jessica
because jessica is so beautiful.
jessica, that was awesome.
rudy?
mom, be careful!
my best friend daddly
cons on there.
- rudy, no one lives on this.
- what?
it's not possible.
that horton is a menace.
mom, mom, please.
you're so weird.
- don't do this to me.
- honey, go to your room.
horton!
it's good.
what do you think you're doing?
ha, you guys are in trouble.
have you forgotten
what we discussed?
oh, no. i'm an elephant. and
elephants never forget.
it's a curse, really.
i remember i was on my head.
and you said, and i looked up.
and you said what are you doing?
and i said the thing
about the speck.
then you pulled my ears.
- and you pulled my fore head.
- horton!
what? you did.
give me that clover, horton.
now.
no!
no?
yeah.
are you sure you wanna
fight this fight, horton?
because i promise you it will
get very ugly, very fast.
and you need to ask yourself.
do i really wanna put
myself through this?
for a clover?
take it from me, horton.
you don't.
so, hand it over.
no! i can't give it to you.
there are people on this speck.
granted they're
very small people.
but a person's a person.
no matter how small.
you just crossed
the line, horton.
and i'm gonna make you pay.
that horton is a menace.
he has those kids using
their imagination.
it's sick.
alright.
i got to get this speck up to
the top of mount nool asap.
whatever that means.
probably act sweetly
awesome peckidom.
i mean, how hard can that be?
it's just the straight
plumit to certain death.
this looks...
kind a precarious.
well...
no need to worry.
obviously when they build
a bridge like this
they take into account that
elephants will be crossing here.
alright. feel good.
i'll just get... woo waaa.
woo...
uh-eee.
ah-eee.
courage woo-uh, that's true.
alright.
hello and how are we
today, mr. mayor?
say aaah.
ah!
ohk!
linch, please.
eh, i think a few of this boards
could stand to be replaced.
uh!
uh!
i just need to think light.
i'm light as a feather.
i'm light as a feather.
heavy feather.
okay...
- this will just pinch
a little. - ahaa
i'm lighter than a feather.
what's lighter than a feather?
ha-ah! air!
there's nothing lighter.
so, it stands to reason...
that the more air i have,
the lighter
i'll be.
next, please.
alright. it was
absolutely terrifying.
if i just pull myself up
trying not to panic.
uh-ah-ah!
hm.
hu.
that could've been a disaster.
wow.
i feel really good right now.
it is my new sense of purpose.
uh-alright!
hey! jojo, i need your help.
can you help me?
o.k. great.
o.k. first. i need you
go to the girls room.
take down the hall
collection, and then...
stop looking into my arm.
put away light bulb
collections, and then
you know what? just take of anything
that might break or shatter.
okay, take a good long look.
got it?
thanks, jojo.
here. i'll take that.
and that.
oh yaaa!
hi! you're home late.
oh, sorry hon, i was just...
- having some dental works on
my arm. - so, what was that?
nedd!
what are you doing?
wa-what do you mean?
well, i'm no detective, nedd. but you
are hanging from the chandelier.
i just thought it
might look better
somewhere it can't fall on
us and crashes our sleep.
what is going on?
hey, hon...
did you ever get the feeling
that you're being watched?
am... ya, sure.
i suppose.
and then you get feeling that maybe
that thing watching you is... ah...
a giant elephant?
am..
you know, how you get that weird feeling
that your world is actually a tiny speck?
and that the elephant that
i talked about earlier
he's carrying it
around on a flower.
and you realize that if you tell
anybody, they think you are crazy...
but you still feel the responsibility
to keep everyone safe.
you know that feeling?
am...
you know, i'm gonna
have to say no.
do you know that feeling?
no.
yarn!
wow! i am beat. time to
hit the hey, i guess.
sweetheart, i know you're
under a lot of stress.
and if you're seeing elephants
and flowers, then fine.
just don't tell anyone
else that story.
okay? and remember...
it's not the end of the world.
the end of the world?
horton, the mayor. horton, the
mayor. come in mayor, over.
horton?
i get terrible reception here.
how about this?!
if i get all broll course?!
can you hear me?!
yeap! roger that!
are we at that safe place yet?
almost.
i'm pretty sure the
worst parts' over.
this is your elephant speaking.
just sit back, enjoy the ride and we
all happy to mount nool in no time.
no, you can't have ice cream.
go back there.
who's there?
is there someone else there?
well, that's my wife and kids.
you have a family.
i do indeed.
a beautiful wife, 96
daughters, and one son.
hohohoho, busy guy.
and we all share one bathroom.
you know what that is.
yeah. don't i know it.
bathroom?
nedd?
- what? - sweetheart. you know
you're on the roof, right?
what's that? no, you need to go to
bed. daddy's having a break down.
ned? what are you up to now?
i was just about to
put the kids to bed,
when i got off the roof.
and i, that's the, that's
what happened, right.
- daddy?
- yes?
- can i have a glass of water?
- of course.
- me too, me three, me four...
- okay.
hey, jojo! wow.
liquid, lot of liquid. just
the person i wanted to see.
yeah. i've realize that we have not
been seeing eye to eye lately.
and most of it is my fault.
it's true.
you know what i've
been trying to do?
i have been trying to impose my
vision of your future on you.
let me make this
perfectly clear.
jojo, you can be whatever
kind of mayor you wanna be.
hands on, strong and silent,
outspoken, it's up to you.
well, good
i hear so much better.
i am expecting big things from
you, youngman. big things!
alright. good night.
good stop! good talk.
then, jojo snuck out
feeling lonely and sad,
and tragically
misunderstood by his dad.
and where was he going at
such a late hour night?
up to whoville's abandoned
star study tower.
a place where the boy
felt contented, free.
a place he could be
what he wanted to be.
and what was inside there,
i'd say if i could.
but up above, the kangaroo
was up to no good.
can i come out now, mom?
no, rudy. stay in the room.
- but, mom?
- stay inside.
mr. vlad-i-koff?
eating, go.
yes. i realize you're busy.
but i need your help.
it's horton.
he's become obsess
with a clover.
and he actually thinks there
are little people on it.
i want that clover destroyed.
sure, what a big deal this is.
for you, bro.
i'd do it myself.
but being a lady,
i prefer not to get
my hands dirty.
but i hear you have
no problem with that.
no.
no problem.
easy busy.
but...
i will only do this for a price.
in exchange for a
brand new pair of...
no.
- this...
- little kangaroo.
- mom?!
quiet, rudy.
momy is thinking it over.
we'll thanks but,
on a second thought
i think i'm going to have the wickersham
brothers take care of this for me.
yeah, of course, wickersham i
mean they're classy operation.
you know, they'd... wait! no!
you can't go over wickersham.
no no. no no no. wickershams
would be perfect for this job.
but, they are monkeys.
he's not scary.
ah, thanks anyway.
maybe next time.
wait!
here is what i will do
the precious clover.
i will take it.
i will crush it.
and i will devour it.
bigger than it looked.
one second.
oly moly.

mr. mayor!
it's snowing in the summer!
yes.
yes, it is.
it's a dramatic change
in the weather.
as if we're on a speck
floating to space.
i don't know how you knew.
but, somehow you did.
and whoville is
headed for disaster.
- oh, horton.
- what?
ah, nothing. i'm on it.
it's up to us to save
the people of whoville.
snow is not lucky.
that's not... stop.

this is not fun.
uh, this is sign of doomed.

this is dangerous.
okay.
horton?
uh? what?
hey, there.
we're in big trouble down here.
it's happening. it's snowing
in the middle of summer.
it's end of the world!
hold on here.
i think i know what
your problem is.
there, get better?
that seems you have worked.
eh-uh. do i smell peanuts?
yes, they are my favorite snack.
but they tender linger.
ohho! k-uh. debrick, no.
oh-o. hang on mr. mayor.
i may have to put up a flight.
frightened elephant can
be very dangerous.
alright!
you come down the under, buddy.
you hungry for trouble?
i don't know how you
can easy self by.
take a fight.
i hate running.
morton!
- don't do that!
- horton!
horton? don't...
there you are.
we got trouble. wait. stay.
wait. can you hear that?
no i'm here. okay.
listen. no, go.
kangaroo has gone nuts, bananas.
she's telling everyone that you
should be kicked out of nool.
she said that?
i thought we're friends.
where is she'e gone to vlad's.
vlad. vlad. i know two vlads.
is it the bad vlad or the bunny
vlad that makes the cookies?
yeah, horton. she's sending
you a bunny with cookies.
i think we can assume
it's not bad vlad.
yeah, that's good call.
so, unless you're cool with
giant razor sharp claws,
there be not fights
up your body,
if i give her the clover.
i can't.
i promised the mayor.
i meant what i said. i
said what what i meant.
and an elephant's
faiths were 100%.
please, for me, just this once,
be faithful 99% of the time.
i've never gone 99% on anything.
i think i'm awesome.
so come on.
i meant to what i said
and i said what i meant.
i'm gonna say it.
you can that all days
it's not happen then.
- an elephant's faithful 100%.
- that's right.
that's my code. my motto.
but thanks for the worning.
motto. o.k.
but watch the skies.
keep watching the skies.
mayor, you need to get
everyone on the ground, now.
- two, three, four...
- i wanna sound the alarm.
there's a good possibility we maybe
attacked by a giant cannibalous bird.
waht?
there's small chance it could
be bunny with cookies.
but, i wouldn't count on it.
- oh, they are
formidable words. - ya.
are you there?
ya, no. that's a great idea.
it just...
in order to get everyone mobilized i
need the o.k. of the city council.
and they never listen to me.
i've been called boob.
several times.
- i can't do it. - you have
to talk to them, mayor.
o.k. listen.
bad vlad.
bad vlad.
bad vlad!
that is definitely not a bunny.
lost him.
mean to lose him.
and i lost him.
this tree for real, come on!
hang on, whoville! this
is gonna get rough!
now you're going to dead-end.
get ready for the best.
leave me alone!
no! hold on!
i just know he's gonna
jump out somewhere.
- hello?
- ah-ak!
chess mate.
now it's time for
me to take clover
and crush all the little
people on a two sang...
sorry. this is
where we get off.
ah, right in the beak!
ah. cool line.
usually i can i think
those things to later.
- mayor?
- ah, horton.
are you o.k.?
ah.
well, more or less.
- what happened? the bird?
- ya, it attacked me.
mayor, your people
are in danger.
you know what, i'm gonna do it.
i'm going to go out there. and
tell them what is going on.
perfect. now quick. get go on.
hey, mr. mayor!
something's wrong!
my basement is in the attic.
the science museum is history.
- we're lost thousand in this
messy. - what's going on mr. mayor?
i'm declaring a
state of emergency.
don't worry. don't worry.
the mayor is just being a moron.
no wait. whoville is
in terrible danger.
everyone needs get down to the
underground storage area immediately.
time time. let's do
this democratically.
who wants the joy and glory and
festivity of the who-centennial
to proceed as planned?
- yeah!
- yeah!
and who, like the mayor,
thinks it would be better
to spend the who-centennial
in an underground storage area?
yeah!
wait! you got to listen to me.
our whole world could explode.
much more quickly.
and our world wouldn't
be that noise.
the people have
spoken mr. mayor.
you're finished.
no one believes you.
no one supports you.
- horton believes me.
- horton?
who's horton?
horton is a giant
elephant in the sky.
don't bother look.
he is invisible.
and he is the one
risking his life
to get whoville which by the way
is a speck on a
clover just safety.
i can prove it.
horton's voice comes
out of this horn.
horton!
i have all the whos
gathered in town square.

gee.
it's a kind of high
pressure situation then.
wow. i'm really
run a blank here.

horton?
horton, we're waiting.
time to show everyone
that you exist and...
by extension what
a none boob i am.

it means, um, it means...
obviously, uh...
let's the kite
flying race begins!

sally.
chairman.
haley, hooly, holy, hilder,
heddy. miss. yelp, dr. larue,
bert from accounting,
mrs. mcquilligany,
mr. farfoogan of the
cloogan farfoogans.
and wasn't there an
old guy in a shower?
- um, bathtub.
- oh, yeah!
we're all here, horton.
and, we all believe in you.
wow! that's awesome.
and it's reponsibility
i do not take lightly.
i promise you a future that
it's safe, sound, and stable.
we will create a world where every who
is indoubt with 3 indelible rights.
to be determined
that a later date.
and we will put us back on mountain
nool before the end of this a decade.
oh!
this, this is the elephant
that is crazy. oh my goodness.
i could tell anyone and
it's to the kangaroo.
quick to they find out of them.
hoho, you should've
been seeing me.
i really read the
elephant habit.
i chase him like doorman and then i break
him into million little elephant pieces.
it was thing of beauty,
really my best work.
classic vlad.
- and the clover?
- clover is finished.
no vain million years
horton finds it.
believe my beak. clover
is gone forever.
i just saw horton. and he is
still talking to that clover.
idiot!
whoa, come on.
hang you, bro. it's me you're
talking to. we have history.
come on. let's don't forget
i did this for free.
what is happening to
the jungle of nool?
there once was a time
when people were people.
and specks were specks.
all i say it you can't see it, hear
it, or feel it, it doesn't exist.
our way of life is under attack.
and who's leading that attack?
horton!
whoa, whoa, whoa!
wait a minute!
this is horton we're talking
about you'll know about him.
he wouldn't hurt a fly. except
for that fly city he sat on.
he didn't that on purpose.
- shut up, mouse.
- oh, yeah. that's weired.
i feel my brain is burning.
i got to go.
are we going to let troublemakers like
horton poison the minds of children?
not the children!
when horton tells our children
about worlds beyond the jungle,
it makes them
question authority.
which leads to the fires,
which leads to shocking!
yeah! horton must pay!
eat that speck!
we have to do something!
- for the children!
- for the children!
are we going to let him
get away with this?
no!
morton! i told you 100%!
horton.
- morton, pick up your
feet, gee. - it's not me.
oh, hoho. i see.
it's an angry mob.
sorry morton. i thought it's
you who's making all the...
but it's...
hold on.
run, horton!
there he is!
let's grab him!
let's take him!
stop!
hey, fellas.
good to see ya.
all at once.
you're look really
great as herd.
horton, horton, horton look at that
mess you created for yourself.
all this holible lure over
us is silly little flower.
it's a speck.
right.
i mean a silly really all this talk
of roping you and caging you and well
we don't need to go
into the details.
the point is this angry mob
of all a trouble you're in.
it can all go away.
- really?
- of course.
all you have to do
is admit to everyone
that there are no little
people living on that speck.
that you're wrong
and i was right.
you do that,
and things can go the right
back to the way they were.
but, if you don't,
you're going to have
to pay the price.
so i just have to
say it isn't true?
go ahead! rope me! cage me!
do whatever you want!
but there are people
on this speck.
and they have a mayor.
who has 96 daughters
and one son name jojo,
who all share a bathroom
whatever that is.
and even though you can't
hear or see them at all,
a person's a person,
no matter how small.
that was beautiful, horton.
rope him! cage him!
burn that speck in a pot of
boiling pees on that oil!
they don't believe we're here.
we've got to make some noise!
we are here. we are here.
we are here.
we are here. we are here. we are here.
we are here. we are here. we are here.
come on!
everybody!
we are here. we are here.
we are here.
this will take you not to make up
stories about people on specks!
listen. there they are!
- rope him!
- cage him!
it's not working.
i can hear you. but, their
ears aren't strong enough.
we need to be louder.
get every who'd make noise!
everyone!
we are here. we are here. we are here.
we are here. we are here. we are here.
jojo, where're you going?
we need every voice! jojo!
you need to make some noise down
there. or we all be destroyed.
the mayor grabbed the tamtam
starting to smeck it.
and all over whoville,
they ooped up all racket.
they rattle tin kettles,
they beat on brass pans,
on garbage fills absonal,
cran berrry cans.
they blew on byzu bilzl
brasstic big tubas.
on durming soom-pazum,
boom-pazum, plutes.
there!
can they hear us now?
listen! please!
it's the most
beautiful thing ever!
i don't hear nothing!
i don't think so.
but, keep trying.
never give... up!
are you sure that every who
down in whoville is trying?
where's jojo?
probably up the old observatory.
hey, there's a limit.
that's not supposed
to strech that far!
jojo!
you built this?
we are here. we are here. we are here.
we are here. we are here. we are here.
you're making a mistake.
mom!
this doesn't concern you,
sweety. back in your pouch!
everybody, don't stop!
keep going! this gonna do it!
- can they hear?
- no!
no matter what happens, i
couldn't ask for a better, son.
ah, hey, jojo?
come on! keep going!
no!
we are here. we are here. we are here.
we are here. we are here. we are here.
no-oh-hou.
we are here. we are here. we are here.
we are here. we are here. we are here.
no!
we are here. we are here. we are here.
we are here. we are here. we are here.
i hear it! i hear it!
they are there!
and that yelp.
that one small extra
yelp put it over.
and all the who noises
brust out of the clover.
- i hear it, too.
- me too, wide.
rudy. give me that! come ru...
rudy, get back in the pouch now.
no, mom.
uh, wickersams, get that clover.
what the... e.. anybody
take it from him.
you did it, mayor.
you did it.
we did it!
yeah!
well done, son.
alright, mayor!
dad, you're one of the greats.
wow! easy everyone. easy!
oh hi, vlad.
well, i shouldn't. but,
oh man, that is nice touch.
i'm a mess with this.
i'm emotional.
here come the water slide.
there is so much
people to thank.
the good people of nool
who put me in a cage and
fork me with sticks.
that was me!
my buddy morton for being
the only who stood by me.
well, not right by me
he hidden in the bushes
sending me good thoughts.
he's small.
dude, you're a worrier poet.
and most of all i'd like to
thank to the mayor of whoville.
- who believed me from the
beginning. - on, horton.
we're going to miss you.
hm-um, gee.
what are we gonna do
without you, horton?
ah, don't worry.
i always be around.
- and even as i wonder,
- on.
keeping in them sight.
you're a candle in the window.
- on a cool dark winter's
night. - beautiful metaphor.
and i'm getting closer than
i ever thought i might.
uh, that's a little high funnys.
baby, i can't fight
this feeling any more.
i've forgotten what i
started fighting for.
- and if i have to crawl upon your
floor. - crawl upon the floor.
- come crashing through your door.
- crashing through your door.
baby i can't fight
this feeling any more.
i can't fight this
feeling any more.
and so all ended well for
those horton and whos.
and for all of the
jungle, even kangaroos.
so let that be a lesson
to one and to all.
a person's a person.
no matter how small.
