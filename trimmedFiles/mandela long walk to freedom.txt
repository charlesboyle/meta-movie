mrs. de kock, my client,

you may address your answers to me.
thank you, your worship.
mrs. de kock, how do we know
that these items are not
my client's herself?
i don't understand.
what is he saying?
well, what i am saying is
can you identify these items
as yours, mrs. de kock?
well, you seem... unsure.
i will not be spoken to like this,
it's disgusting.
if i'd known i was going to be
so insulted in a court of law,

well, do you know
anything about us?

the african national congress?
if you went out today
and said, "follow me,"
nobody would follow you,
so why should i?
do you like it when the boers
are calling you "boy"?

- that you want, will there be violence?
- there is violence now.
for 50 years, we have been
talking peace and nonviolence.

[crowd murmuring]
quiet! quiet!
my lord, i call the case of the state
against the national high command
of umkhonto we sizwe, the military wing
of the african national congress.
the state contends that the accused
are responsible for acts of sabotage
aimed at facilitating violent revolution
and an armed invasion of this country
with the intention
of overthrowing the government.
accused number one, nelson mandela.
do you plead guilty or not guilty?
my lord, it is not i
but the government
that should be put in the dock.
- [crowd murmuring]
- i plead not guilty.
[crowd gasping]
the state has formally advised me
that they will be asking
for the supreme penalty
permissible by law.
which is death.
our best chance is to attack
the credibility of the charges.
we dispute every falsehood,
we challenge every charge.
we think they'll bring
in a guilty verdict,
but we might be able to
avoid the death sentence.
- agreed?
- agreed.
[muttering] agreed.
then be happy.
smile.
this may be the greatest service
we will ever do for our people.
[crowd chanting outside]
[chanting] mandela! mandela!
my name is nelson mandela.
i'm the first accused.
i do not deny that
i planned sabotage.
i did not plan it
in a spirit of recklessness
nor because i have any love
for violence.
the hard facts are
that 50 years of non-violence
had brought the african
people nothing
but more and more
repressive legislation
and fewer and fewer rights.
africans want
a just share
in the whole of south africa.
we want equal political rights,
one man, one vote.
i have dedicated myself to this struggle
of the african people.
i have fought against
white domination.
i have fought against
black domination.
i have cherished the
ideal of a free,
democratic society
where all persons
live together in harmony
with equal opportunities.
it is an ideal which
i hope to live for
and achieve,
but, if needs be,
it is an ideal for which
i am prepared to die.
[crowd chanting]
<i>- amandla!
- awethu!</i>
<i>- amandla!
- awethu!</i>
[chanting continues]
before the judge imposes
the supreme penalty,
there is one more step.
he will ask the first accused, nelson,
"have you any reason to advance
whether the sentence
should not be passed?"
- you could then say...
- i have nothing more to say.
that won't help your appeal.
there will be no appeal.
no appeal?
we have talked about this.
we are ready.
<i>[man] all rise.</i>
i have reached my verdict.
the defendants will rise.
the accused are all found
guilty as charged.
[crowd gasping]
the accused have made high moral claims
for their actions.
in essence,
they have courted martyrdom
at the hands of what they
call "their oppressors."
but i will not give them
that satisfaction.
let us show the world
that we are a nation of laws
and where possible,
we temper justice with mercy.
i have therefore decided
not to impose the supreme penalty.
[crowd gasping]
the sentence in the case
of all the accused...
will be life imprisonment.

- [sighs]
it's nothing i can't deal with.
they like to have
little chats with me.
usually they wait till just before
the girls come back from school
to take me away.
so the girls will
find an empty home.
they think about these things,
you know.
they think about me a lot.
- how do you bear it?
- by hating them.
and don't tell me i'm wrong,
it keeps me strong.
hey. family matters only.
your mother, madiba,
she is sick.
they say she will die soon.
i have failed her.
no.
she understands.
and she's proud of you.
is that true?
she told me so herself.
mandela, let's go.

no, it's a fact,

- lawyers are cheetahs, madiba.

and i've always believed that one day,
you... you'll be free.
we will be able to touch.
[mandela sighs]
you must tell our friends...

i'll tell them.

dr. niel barnard,
national intelligence service.
- pleased to meet you.
- hello.
mr. mandela.
we five are charged
by the president
to find a way out
of our current difficulties.
are you sure that
you can talk to me?
i am a member of
a banned organization.
[chuckles] oh, we'll talk to you,
if you'll talk to us.
well, gentlemen...
[sighs]
shall we begin?
i don't trust them.
this is not the time to talk.
i don't think madiba should be
talking to them on his own.
let's just put it to the vote.
i propose no private talks.
and you, walter?
none of us are bigger
than the movement.
four against one. motion carried.
i take note, comrades...
but i will do
what i believe is right.
you have the most
powerful army in africa.
there's no way
we can match you in battle,
but we have 30 million people.
i would call that a stalemate.
all right.
here's the bottom line:
you end the violence, and we'll
give you a share in power.
a share?
well, obviously, we can't accept
a crude one man, one vote system.
yeah, if the blacks take over,
our country is finished.
we are finished.
- why?
- "why?"
"if the blacks take over..."
can you imagine what the
blacks would do to us
if they got us in their power?
i am black.
you are different.
that is why we are talking to you.
[indistinct chattering]
[kathy] these are the same people
that threw him in jail,
that persecuted his wife,
that murdered his friends,
and he's talking to them.
[barnard] i don't believe
you don't want revenge.
you are right.
i do.
so?
how can we ever allow you
to have any real power?
well, i admit i want revenge,
but i want something
more than that,
and that is to live
without fear and hatred.
sweet dreams, mr. mandela.
i have no choice.
i have seen what fear
has done to your people.
you've always been afraid of us,
and it has made you an
unjust and brutal people.
now consider our position.
we know that one
day we will be free,
and we will be the rulers
of our country,
but do we want to live
in the same hell as you do now?
that would be to
lock ourselves back
into prison and our children
and generations after that.
gentlemen, look,
i can tell you for nothing,
when we come to power,
there will be no revenge.

well, i was married in 1958,
arrested in '62.
i didn't touch her again until '84.

<i>[mandela] this is very true, my friend.
i never stopped loving her.</i>
<i>but i love her as she was.</i>
the first step
to regaining the confidence
of the markets is your release,
and then, of course,
the release of your colleagues.
we've briefed the president.
he's a pragmatist;
he heard us.
the government agrees to lift the ban
on the anc and repeal the race laws.
you undertake to renounce violence.
no.
- but you said...
- i said nothing.
i listened.
but you will withdraw your
demand for majority rule?
no.
then what are you giving us
in exchange for what we give you?
nothing.
these meetings have been
a complete waste of all our time.
well, i wouldn't say
that i've wasted my time.
the president has made up his mind.
it can't be stopped now.

the president is a member
of the gereformeerde kerk,

a special task in a special time.

unconditionally.
a car will be ready at 9:00 tomorrow
morning to take you to the airport.
a plane will be waiting to fly
you directly to johannesburg
where the official release
ceremony will take place.
mr. de klerk,
your people have taken
away half of my life
and returned me an old man
to a home that has
been long abandoned
and a family that have
grown up without me.
i don't want you at my side
at that moment.
i don't want to be told that you
have given me my freedom.
just open the gate
and let me go.
[wind blowing]
[laughter]

any minute now.
ok, tata?
hello, hello.
how are you, auntie?

began, the government here is beginning</i>

you know this.

[man] that is not going to happen.
we are not sharing power
with these whites.
as long as there are
white people in south africa,
- that is not going to happen.
- i mean, just how?
how do we accept power
sharing with the whites?
what do we do? do we fight?
do we start a war?
we have a war!
what, you think this is not a war?
we have a war,
what we need now is victory.
comrades, our people can never
accept sharing power with the whites.
people will not accept this.
what de klerk wants is ministers
in the new government.
- why should de klerk get what he wants?
- de klerk is right.
we must let them share the power.
a little power for a little while
until the fear has passed.
madiba, i don't think our
people will accept that.
then we must make them accept.
we are their leaders.
that is our job.

i hear the voice of the people.
and that voice says,
"we will fight."
[cheering]
[crowd chanting]
mama,
madiba wants to see you inside.
[crowd cheering]
all right.
what?
are you ashamed to greet me
in front of our people?
winnie, when you speak in public,
you must represent
the policies of the anc.
- and what does that mean?
- we are negotiating.
- we are not fighting a war.
- but the people have chosen to fight.
do you want me to
betray our people?
- do i betray our people?
- you have been away a long time.
what does that mean,
i've been away?
does that mean now
you can terrorize people?
the burning, the necklacing,
that has to stop, winnie.
you realize there's a war out there.
the people are angry.
we are all angry.
i am angry!
you are angry,
but you must show loyalty!
loyalty, winnie mandela.
loyalty.
[sighs]
i have decided that it would be better
if i live in my own home.
better for the party.
better for us.
- "better for the party"?
- you have your own home in diepkloof.
you have your own company there.
am i to blame because
i don't want to be alone?
you know, so much
of my life,
i have been alone.
we have both been alone
too much, winnie.
[mandela] why, walter?
tell me why, hmm?
why, why do you show me this?
- do you think i don't know?
- this has gone too far.
- if she was discrete about this...
- i have accepted the situation!
what business is
it of anyone else?
she humiliates you in public, madiba.
and that hurts all of us.
come now.
<i>[mandela] what they have done to my
wife is their only victory over me.</i>
<i>in view of the tensions
that have arisen</i>
<i>between my wife and myself
in the recent months,</i>
we have mutually agreed
that a separation
would be best for each of us.
<i>i shall personally never regret</i>
<i>the life that we tried
to share together.</i>
<i>i part from my wife
with no recriminations.</i>
<i>i embrace her with all the love
and affection</i>
<i>i have nursed for her
inside and outside of prison</i>
<i>from the moment i first met her.</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,
i hope that you can appreciate</i>
<i>the pain that i am going through.</i>
<i>- thank you.

<i>[reporter] police opened fire
on gun-carrying demonstrators...</i>
mr. mandela?
president de klerk here.
the situation on the streets
is out of control.
is this the peaceful
south africa you say you want?
- [gunshots]
- [screaming]
<i>[reporter] black-on-black violence has</i>
<i>reached proportions of near civil war.</i>
[shouting]
<i>they began fighting as the
power struggle developed</i>
<i>in south africa to replace
white rule with black.</i>
<i>[reporter 2] two hundred zulus
rampaged through boipatong,</i>
<i>cutting down anyone they saw.</i>
[screaming]
- [sobbing]
- [distant singing]
[sobbing continues]
madiba, do something.
[speaks in african language]
do something.
do something, do something.
<i>[reporter] president de klerk blames
the boipatong massacre...</i>
<i>[reporter 2] ...attacks by the inkatha
freedom party supporters</i>
<i>on an anc rally near johannesburg
has left 13 people dead.</i>
<i>[reporter 3] it could set back
the peace process in south africa</i>
<i>by months, if not years.</i>
<i>[reporter 4] ...violence has now put
south africa's constitution...</i>
<i>[reporter 5] ...de klerk has attacked
what he calls "the ultimatum politics"</i>
<i>of the anc.</i>
<i>[reporter 6] increasing financial
and diplomatic isolation...</i>
<i>- please sit down.
- [reporter speaking afrikaans]</i>
<i>[reporter 7] ...today's move on capitol
hill, the indications...</i>
mr. mandela, you're going to be
talking into that camera.
- yes, this one.
- a little bit more light please.
yeah, lovely, you see?
<i>[various broadcast reports overlapping]</i>
<i>[reporter 8] ...wondering whether
it can survive the rage</i>
<i>that divides that nation,
black and white.</i>
<i>[reporter 9] ...but it does not derail
talks toward ending white rule.</i>
<i>[reporter 10] south african president,
fw de klerk...</i>
<i>[reporter 11] panic, chaos, confusion...</i>
<i>[reporter 12]
...white minority's worst nightmare.</i>
<i>[report 11]
...crisis for this country...</i>
[woman] five seconds, four,
three, two...
someone gave me this note...
when i was leaving boipatong...
and i want to read it to you.
it says,
"no peace.
do not talk about peace.
we have had enough.
please, mr. mandela,
no peace.
give us weapons,
not peace."
here is my answer.
[clock ticking]
there is only one way forward,
and that is peace.
[shouting]
i know that is not
what you want to hear,
but there is no other way.
<i>i am your leader,</i>
<i>and as long as i am your leader,</i>
<i>i'm going to give you leadership.</i>
as long as i am your leader,
i am going to tell you always
when you are wrong,
<i>and i tell you now,
you are wrong.</i>
[indistinct chattering]
<i>i have given my
life to the struggle.</i>
<i>i've been willing to die.</i>
<i>i have lost 27 years of my life</i>
<i>in prison,</i>
<i>but i tell you now,</i>
<i>i have forgiven them.</i>
[shouting]
if i can forgive them...
then you can forgive them.
we cannot win a war,
but we can win an election.
so, my people...
stay home...
be peaceful,
and when election day comes...
vote.
- cut there.
- ja, we've cut.
[speaking in afrikaans]
[shudders]
<i>[mandela] after so much suffering,
why would anyone believe</i>
<i>that putting a mark on
a piece of paper...</i>
<i>is going to change the world?</i>
[up-tempo music playing]
[indistinct chattering]
[cheering]
[cheering]
[cheering]
[cheering]
[crowd chanting, singing]
<i>[child shouting in distance]</i>
<i>[mandela]
i still dream the old dream,</i>
<i>back in the house in orlando.</i>
<i>i can hear all the ones
that i have loved most in the world.</i>
[laughter echoing]
<i>i want to reach them...</i>
<i>to touch them...</i>
<i>- ...but they have gone.
- [baby cooing]</i>
<i>[child, echoing] tata...</i>
[sighs]
[man]
madiba, are you ready for this?
[clicking]
- these are my jailers now.
- [laughter]
[woman] this is a proud day,
mr. mandela.
[mandela] feels good.
[cheering, applause]
[cheering, applause fades]
<i>[mandela] i have walked
a long walk to freedom.</i>
<i>it has been a lonely road...</i>
<i>- ...and it is not over yet.
- [children chattering]</i>
<i>i know that my country</i>
<i>was not made to be a land of hatred.</i>
<i>no one is born hating
another person</i>
<i>because of the color of his skin.</i>
<i>people learn to hate.</i>
<i>they can be taught to love,</i>
<i>for love comes more naturally</i>
<i>to the human heart.</i>
