in a time before
many can remember,
our planet faced its
greatest challenge.
a warlord named piccolo
came from beyond the stars,
bringing darkness and chaos
to our once peaceful world.
aided by his disciple oozaru,
the evil pair brought the human
race to the brink of annihilation.
cities and countries
crumbled beneath them.
countless lives were lost.
but... finally,
a group of brave warriors
created the ma fu ba,
a powerful enchantment that imprisoned
piccolo deep within the earth.
with his master captured,
oozaru disappeared,
and balance was slowly
restored to our world.
and so it has remained
for thousands of years,
until now.
the first rule is...
there are no rules.
first one to touch
the ground loses.
prepare to eat dirt.
whoa!
ha!
whoa!
oh—
harsh. man!
yeah. shadow crane strike.
you fell for it again.
well, it's kind of hard to
block a move that i can't see.
goku, you rely too heavily
on your external senses.
to see, to hear, to touch...
are all overrated.
oh, true power
comes from inside.
your ki.
yeah. that's your
best defense...
and your greatest weapon.
see? now use your ki.
mmm.
i'm sorry, grandpa. i
didn't feel a thing.
someday, goku.
yeah. someday i'll beat you.
that'll be something to tell your
friends— beating up on a 70-year-old man.
what friends? everybody at school
treats me like i'm nothing, grandpa.
you're special, goku.
no. i'm different.
i know that, and
they know that too.
they push me so far...
that i want to explode.
you know, i could tear
them apart with one hand.
i don't train you to fight boys, goku.
you promised.
okay. you made me
promise not to fight.
then teach me
something i can use.
teach me— teach me
how to get the girl.
teach me how to talk to her without
stumbling all over everything i say.
teach me how to be normal.
normal is also overrated.
you must have faith
in who you are.
goku.
happy birthday.
you think i forgot?
susinchu is yours.
what is it? it's a dragonball.
susinchu means "four stars."
in all the world, there
are only six others—
from one to seven stars.
besides you, goku,
it's my only treasure.
so what's it do? by itself, nothing.
but together,
the seven dragonballs will grant
the holder one perfect wish.
so keep it safe always.
thanks, grandpa.
whoa!
what...
hey, fuller.
hey, fuller! you just
wrecked my bike.
agundes, did you just fart, man? 'cause i
could have swore i just heard something.
you're gonna pay
for this, fuller.
make me pay, "geeko."
come on. come on, geeko.
right here. come on, baby.
show me what you got.
just like i thought. nothin'.
carey, let's go. i'm
gonna be late for class.
beauty awaits me.
what's up, emi? hey.
he looks like he's gonna cry.
what's the matter with you?
it's all right.
i have what you want.
on your knees.
this is an astrological phenomenon
known as a complete solar eclipse.
in two weeks' time, we'll
all have the opportunity...
to experience this rare
phenomenon for ourselves.
now, what causes eclipses, hmm?
mr. kingery. weaver.
a solar eclipse is caused by the moon
blocking the sun from the earth.
correct. from the
dawn of civilization,
superstitions have marked solar
eclipses as the sign of the apocalypse.
in india, for example, the
eclipse symbolizes rahu,
demon of darkness,
devouring the sun.
the chinese believe eclipses
are caused by a dragon—
goku.
goku! yeah. what?
what might our ancestors say about
the upcoming solar eclipse?
oh, uh,
well, my grandfather would
say, "beware of the nameks."
nameks?
yeah. they're an alien race that
nearly destroyed earth over...
uh, 2,000 years ago.
well, let's hope it doesn't
happen again, hmm?
oh, no.
oh, great. not again. i hate those things.
they never work.
and just look at my picture.
i have a paper due next period,
and it's stuck in here.
gotta go.
damn it!
oh!
hey. goku, right?
yeah.
- did you do that?
- uh, yeah.
you used your ki.
wait. you know about ki?
just because my name is chi chi
doesn't make me a complete idiot.
right. right. 'cause there's a
lot stupider names than chi chi.
i'm not saying that chi
chi's a stupid name.
i'm just saying that
it's not normal.
ah. but normal is overrated.
i'm not saying that you're stupid or
overrated. i’m just— i'm gonna stop now.
hey. i'm having a party
tonight at my house.
i'll be there.
okay. yes!
hi. hi.
hi, chi chi. hi.
goku! i got fresh chicken feet!
yeah. couldn't find
good swallow's tongue.
ah, but the squabs were fat.
beauty awaits.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
mmm.
goku. happy birthday!
goku?
- hey. check it out.
- there he is.
what are you doing here, geeko?
uh, i'm just going to the party.
uh— i was invited. i'm not
looking for any trouble.
trouble found you, freak.
so, listen. why don't you
turn around, walk away,
no one will even
know you were here.
see ya.
- later, loser.
- all right.
i'm not doing that anymore.
i made a promise that
i wasn't gonna fight.
what?
i made a promise that i'm
not gonna fight. oh.
don't worry. it
won't be a fight.
it'll be a massacre.
missed.
missed again.
whoa!
my hand!
that's gotta hurt.
hey, chi chi.
hey. thanks for inviting
me to your party.
oh, uh, and, fuller,
your boys...
they've been showing
me what they got.
nothin'.
you're so dead.
no, carey, stop!
my car!
nice swing. good form.
close one.
ooh, ooh.
doing good.
hey, fuller.
hey. you got a couple of dings there
you might want to try buffing out.
you've never done this before, have you?
uh, yes. many times.
in my head.
you're different.
it's... i like different.
i know this may be hard
to believe, but...
we're a lot alike.
this is the best
birthday i've ever had.
today's your birthday?
yeah. actually, right now.
ever since i can remember,
me and my grandpa celebrate my
birthday at the exact same time.
he calls it my grand entrance.
what happened to your parents?
uh, i don't know.
but my grandpa said everything will
be explained to me when i turn 18.
and i'm 18.
cool.
yeah. come.
piccolo!
it's not here.
dear god. no!
i will have the
dragonball, old man.
something's wrong.
something is... something's
wrong with my grandpa.
what? i have to go. i'm sorry.
- goku.
- i'll see you later!
grandpa!
goku.
no.
come on. come on,
come on, come on.
grandpa, i'm gonna go get help.
no. stay here with me.
not much time left.
i'm sorry. i'm so sorry,
grandpa, i wasn't here.
- what happened?
- piccolo has returned.
he's after the dragonball.
is it safe?
- yeah.
- it has begun.
find master roshi in paozu.
tell him piccolo has returned.
to banish piccolo
from this world,
you must find the dragonballs
before the eclipse.
- what?
- "seven dragonballs must be found,
for all man's fate will
be bound." all right.
grandpa. stop. stop. you have to rest.
you have to rest.
goku.
remember.
always have faith
in who you are.
grandpa.
where is it? i know it's here.
are you piccolo? did you kill
my grandfather? listen, idiot.
if i was a piccolo, whatever
that is, i wouldn't tell you.
and if i did kill your grandfather,
i would have shot you by now.
somebody stole my promethium orb,
and i'm here to get it back.
what?
you have it.
nice move. but i'm not
gonna miss again.
my father found that
promethium orb 20 years ago,
and you stole it
from me last night.
i'm not leaving here without it. i
don't know what you're talking about.
this is a dragonball. susinchu.
four-star ball.
i promised my grandfather
i would keep it safe,
so i'm not letting anyone take it from me.
four stars?
promethium orb has five stars.
who's the idiot? look at it.
oh, my god.
i could have killed you.
oh, you weren't even close.
i knew it. there are others.
seven, to be exact. what
do you want for this one?
it's not for sale.
everybody's got a price.
not me. what happened
to your dragonball?
last night, a thief broke into my
father's company, capsule corporation.
somebody hacked the vault, killed the
guards and stole the dragonball.
i swore to my father
i'd get it back.
i followed the signal here, and
that's when i ran into you.
i'm sorry i fired on you. i thought
you were a murdering thief.
just lucky you weren't
a better shot.
how'd you know i had
the dragonball?
a little machine i invented.
this can detect and locate the signature
wavelengths emitted by the dragonballs.
see?
you made a dragonball
energy locator?
- cool.
- dragonball energy..."d.b.e."
- catchy name.
- so you must be a scientist.
ph.d. in applied dynamics, with
a minor in tactical weaponry.
i'm close to a breakthrough.
i can feel it.
the key must be the other dragonballs.
i have to have them all.
- what good's the dragonballs gonna do you?
- they're gonna make me famous.
i'm gonna make them an
unlimited source of energy.
good luck with that.
i'm goku.
you know, maybe we
could help each other.
see, i need to find a
master roshi in paozu.
if you take me there, i'll help
you find the dragonballs.
i have the d.b.e. why
would i need you?
well, obviously somebody
else is looking for them.
and you—
you might need backup.
bulma briefs.
hey, where's your, uh—
ride?
cool.
- mmm.
- directory information downloaded.
i have tried every possible
spelling of roshi in the directory.
he's not listed. did
you try "master"?
- m-a-s— idiot.
are you sure you don't want one?
he's here.
how do you know?
hmm. i can always
sense my grandfather.
i know he's gone now, but i can—
i'm getting the same feeling.
there's another dragonball here.
let's go!
bulma. bulma!
bulma, wait.
bulma, wait!
bulma, you can’t just break
into someone's house.
we're not breaking in.
door's unlocked.
all right. this
girl's out of control.
bulma.
bulma!
bulma.
no.
thief!
this is not what you—
this is not happening.
believe it, punk. you are
getting your clock cleaned.
ooh!
you have been trained well.
stop.
you both have to stop.
now i am going to end it.
sorry.
shadow crane strike.
i'd recognize that anywhere.
- how's gohan?
- you knew my grandfather?
knew him? i trained him.
you are master roshi.
i am muten roshi,
the invincible!
my grandfather is dead.
he was murdered.
i will avenge him.
but before he—
he died, he asked
me to find you...
and to tell you that
piccolo has returned.
he said that you would
know what to do.
he also told me a poem.
it was "seven dragonballs."
"seven dragonballs
must be found,
"for all man's fate
will be bound...
"to battle forces
of death and fear...
and compel shen long to appear."
it was a nursery rhyme,
told to us by ancient master.
then you probably know we have to find
the dragonballs before the eclipse.
eclipse?
do you have a dragonball?
bikini quarterly?
that's a collector's edition.
goku.
if the prophecy is true,
in seven days...
the sun will be eclipsed
by the blood moon.
that will be the beginning
of the apocalypse.
roshi, don't be crazy.
you said it yourself.
it's a nursery rhyme.
yes. because before tonight,
i could make no sense of it.
but finally i can see.
you! you are the key somehow.
gohan knew it.
that's why he trained you.
okay, goku.
this has been great. you
found your master roshi.
i kept my part of the bargain. now it's
time for you to keep yours. let's go.
if what gohan said is true
and piccolo is here,
this wish may be
the only thing...
that can save our world.
we'll go.
but we go together.
much easier to find
without the water.
i will take you to a secret
place where a chosen few...
were taught to master the
energy of the three elements:
air, fire and water.
shadow crane strike is the most basic
o fall the air-bending techniques.
to learn what i have to teach
you, you have to become stronger.
you wanted him.
although i am beginning to
appreciate the entertainment value.
all right.
leave your hand there another
second and you'll lose it.
let's go.
this stone temple has been a source of
solitude and enlightenment for millennia.
here you will learn what i
learned from the ancient master.
oh!
i thought you said
this place is secret.
chi chi?
chi chi.
yeah! yeah!
wow.
hey, goku. what are
you doing here?
i was just about to
ask you the same thing.
walk with me? yeah.
this is where everyone comes to train
for the big tournament in toisan.
that's what i, uh, wanted
to tell you at the party,
before you suddenly took off.
i heard about your
grandfather's accident.
i'm so sorry.
the house collapsed?
uh, yeah. something like that.
hey. what was it that
you wanted to tell me?
nobody at home knows this,
but i'm a fighter too.
they just wouldn't understand.
goku. let's go.
i gotta go.
come to the
tournament in toisan.
maybe we can find some
time to mix it up.
okay.
we can't train here. my
ki is shriveling up.
hey. at least this won't
be a total waste.
i got a signal from a dragonball.
let's go.
now, one hand.
to master the second
level of air-bending,
you have to control
two things at once.
knock this orange from my hand.
i'm getting a strong signal...
from a dragonball only
three miles ahead.
whoa!
whoa!
- whoa!
- sorry.
what happened?
that hole came out of nowhere.
whoa! need any help down there?
let me handle this.
oh! you are such a lifesaver.
we are just stuck down here.
i'd be, uh, so grateful...
if you could just help
me and my friends out.
for a pretty thing like you?
no problemo.
thank you. you're a
real gentleman.
yamcha, at your service.
i'm gonna need some payment.
payment?
who do you think made this trap?
wait a minute. is that a capsule
rx 550 roadster i see down there?
yo! i'll take that.
you're nothing but a lowlife bandit.
yeah.
but one with a ladder.
just think it over,
'cause after the sun comes out,
it's gonna be hot, hot, hot.
hot!
now all we need are
marshmallows and a ghost story.
we have no marshmallows,
but i do have a story.
the earth was nearly destroyed.
not by man but by
gods from the sky.
their names were
piccolo and oozaru.
seven mystics banded together
to fight the invaders.
they sacrificed their lives
to cast the ma fu ba,
a powerful curse that
imprisoned piccolo.
now, piccolo has
somehow escaped.
in two days, the blood moon
will eclipse the sun...
and bring forth
oozaru, his disciple.
to stop piccolo,
whoever can find all
seven dragonballs...
can resurrect the
power of shen long...
and be granted one perfect wish.
unless we find the
dragonballs...
and use our wish to banish
piccolo from this world,
we will have no defense
against the onslaught.
what a crock. you expect
me to believe that?
i do not. i think you are the kind of
person who does not believe in anything.
i feel sorry for you.
yeah. whatever. i'm not the
one stuck in the hole.
let us out! now!
whoa there, jumping bean.
one more outburst like
that, and i'm out of here.
the dragonball's close.
but i think it's
buried underground.
enough games. we have
no time to waste.
- send down a net.
- hey, rosh.
we're gonna need some
tools to excavate!
how would you like to make more
money than you ever dreamed of?
now you’re talking, bro.
wh— oh.
if that d.b.e. thing is right, the ball you're
looking for is right here. let's go. come on!
you have no right to give away a third
of the royalties to my invention.
one day dragonballs
could power the world.
don't worry. a third
of zero is still zero.
done. whoo! ooh, yeah.
well, i guess if you
hadn't robbed us,
we wouldn't be able to
get this dragonball.
well, everything happens
for a reason, bro.
got that one from daytime tv.
- the dragonball is close.
-  be on your guard.
piccolo is also after
the dragonball.
i followed muten
roshi as directed.
he is training the boy...
san-goku.
i could disrupt them.
no. this will require
more than a disruption.
your blood will give it life.
the dragonballs are
within my grasp.
and with them, the power
to destroy this world.
so, after we get the seven dragonballs,
how soon can i expect some profit?
huh? a month?
a year?
high temps are screwing with the signal.
i can't get a good read on it.
- peas and rice!
- i just fried my na—
oh! but i see it.
the problem is how
to get across.
come on!
goku, down!
hey!
- huh?
- go!
go!
hit 'em, rosh!
into the lava! that's the
only way to stop them!
- what are you doing?
- making a bridge!
impressive!
whoa! ah!
the power to prevent
this is inside you.
master roshi, the dragonballs.
they've been speaking to you.
yeah.
they are showing you a future.
there's this demon—
oozaru. the destroyer.
he will kill you.
and bulma. and yamcha.
he will destroy everything.
the future's always changing.
let the dragon show
you his lessons.
i need to somehow defeat oozaru.
the eclipse is in two days. we'll never
find the other dragonballs in time.
there is another way
to stop piccolo.
the only chance the
world has now...
is in toisan.
toisan.
roshi. how is my
favorite skeptic?
i come to apologize,
sifu norris.
everything that i
questioned before...
i now know is all true.
the prophecy.
the blood moon will
eclipse the sun tomorrow.
i need your help.
i need another
containment vessel.
the ma fu ba?
that will consume all
of your life forces.
when you put it that
way, the plan sucks.
but the boy will not be ready.
mmm.
it's the only way.
i'm the only one who can do it.
we will have it ready
by the morning.
namaste.
ready? let's go.
black concedes.
why enter the tournament
if you’re not gonna fight?
the winner by concession— red.
goku! whoa!
you made it. yeah.
wh-what's this?
watanabe versus tanaka.
are you okay?
uh, yeah. it's nothing. are
you in the tournament?
no, i'm here for something else.
something more
important than me?
actually, you're one of the
reasons why it's so important.
i've got a confession to make.
i wanted to be famous.
i wanted to be rich.
well, neither of us are
gonna get what we wanted.
look at these people.
they have no idea. yeah.
i wish i didn't know myself.
never thought i could
enjoy talking to a thief.
you know,
i'm not so bad once
you get to know me.
maybe i like bad men.
that's good to know on the day
before the end of the world.
hey!
hey.
we still have our dragonballs.
that's right. piccolo
needs all seven.
he still can't make
his wish either.
and that means you can
still make your 30%.
wh— thirty-three and a third!
don't push it. no,
the final level
of air-bending technique...
is the kame hame ha.
yeah. my grandpa
told me about that.
but he said that i wasn't
ready to learn it yet.
you are not. okay.
but time is running out.
to master the kame hame ha,
you have to master your ki.
draw the power of the universe.
channel it through you.
focus it.
then release!
what?
the more you put yourself into the
kame hame ha, the greater the power.
practice. light the
torches in the courtyard.
i will see you in the morning.
mm-hmm.
man.
that's cheating.
you're supposed to light
the torches with your ki.
have you been watching me?
- then i guess you know
why i have to cheat.
you know, my grandpa always
said in order to master my ki,
i have to be at one with
myself and with my enemy.
i still don't know
what that means.
maybe you need an incentive.
whoa.
there are five unlit
torches in this courtyard.
you're five paces away from me.
every time you light a torch,
you get to take one
step closer to me.
what happens after i
light all five torches?
then you'll be standing
right next to me—
where i can reach you.
you're on.
very impressive.
yeah.
not bad.
all right.
take one step back.
- that wasn't the rules!
- my game, my rules.
three more. concentrate.
it doesn't feel right. i
must be missing something.
you have to make
every move your own.
you can do this.
well—
i think the next move,
it would be better to
blow out all the torches.
stop right there!
chi chi?
oh. l-i'm sorry. i didn't
mean to wake anyone.
uh, no, i'm sorry.
go back to what you were doing.
no, no— i was just leaving. hey!
what are you guys
doing out here?
nothing.
isn't there a curfew
in this temple?
good night.
- i didn't think goku had it in him.
- it's always the quiet ones.
hey, you guys are up late.
weren't you in your room?
she's got the dragonballs.
who the hell are you?
we'll find another way.
chi chi?
chi chi!
help me, goku.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
goku, stop!
oh, sh— wrong one.
are you okay?
he's alive, but barely.
grandpa! i'm so
happy to see you!
wait. are you here for me?
it's not your time, goku.
there's much left to do.
grandpa, how? how
do i defeat oozaru?
always have faith
in who you are.
kame...
hame...
ha!
pain is good.
we're too late. they have
all seven dragonballs.
dragon temple.
that's where he will
resurrect shen long.
come on.
roshi?
the enchantments are strong.
pray it is enough
to contain piccolo.
good luck, my friend.
namaste.
we will meet again...
on the other side.
now, where am i going?
dragon temple.
we have to get there
before the eclipse.
imagine...
being shackled so tightly...
that every atom in your body...
stood compacted,
still.
that was my hell...
for 2,000 years.
with this dragonball,
i take my vengeance
upon the earth.
come on! let's go!
i hope you're not trying to impress me.
i wouldn't mind.
but i'll settle for scaring
the crap out of you!
whoo-hoo! whoo!
i have to stop him before
he finishes the prayer.
no!
i'm losing her!
i'm glad to have you join me.
you will bear witness
to my glory...
when i compel shen long to grant me
the power to rule this diseased rock.
i will defeat oozaru, and
i am here to destroy you.
defeat oozaru?
when the blood moon
eclipses the sun,
you will become oozaru.
what? no.
there is no denial.
goku's time is over.
no. no. no!
- goku is a shell.
-  shell.
this is who you are.
you traveled by meteor...
to hide amongst the vermin
until your 18th birthday.
- this is where you landed,
and where you will be reborn.
you serve me!
come on.
goku, no!
i don't think goku's
there anymore.
oozaru, they have a dragonball.
bring it to me.
ma fu ba!
what? what?
go.
no. go!
roshi! let me help you!
too late.
protect the dragonball.
run!
oozaru can't be
beaten with fists.
only with faith... can you win.
don't let oozaru destroy...
the goku in you.
always have faith
in who you are.
no!
you have to make
every move your own.
you are special, goku.
impossible.
something my
grandfather taught me.
first rule is...
there are no rules.
wait!
take it.
the dragonball is mine.
i totally had that
under control.
i am... goku.
i am oozaru.
to be at one with
myself, i must be two.
i must have faith in who i am.
human power has failed before.
kame!
as it will—
- hame!
- again!
ha!
i wish it didn't have
to end this way.
shen long.
one wish will be granted.
dragon!
the test of seven has
been fulfilled!
i compel you to come
forth and grant my wish!
give life...
to muten roshi.
i had the strangest dream.
i was in a place l-i
can't describe.
i felt content, like i belonged.
i was happy!
then your grandfather gohan came
up to me and kicked me out.
said there was a lot you
still needed to learn.
he's right. i'm
sorry, master roshi.
we just weren't ready
to have you leave us.
i know. i know.
that's sweet, ladies, but notice
we're missin' something here?
the dragonballs are gone.
we have to find them again.
you ready?
i just have to do one thing.
i didn't think i was
gonna see you again.
i'm sorry. i am so
sorry that i hurt you.
i would never do that on purpose.
it was just—
i was in the heat of battle, and
i thought you were someone else—
it's all right. i
let you hit me.
i was just too fast. you're fast,
but i let you hit me. well,
it was dark and confusing.
i wasn't holding back.
okay. if our relationship
is gonna go anywhere,
we're gonna have to settle this.
