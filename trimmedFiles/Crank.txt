in a story so bizarre...
...i can scarcely believe
the events i'm reporting...
...and yet corroborated
by a dozen eyewitnesses...
...a white male apparently fell
from the sky...
...above downtown
los angeles today...
...landed in the middle
of a busy intersection...
...destroying one vehicle
and hospitalizing its elderly driver...
...and was removed from the scene...
...before emergency personnel
could respond.
without a body, the police have yet
to piece together events of a day...
...that can only be described
as implausible.
reports of a body
landing in the boyle heights area...
...have yet to be confirmed,
and are being treated...
...as the bullshit they most likely are.
you big cock english.
strong like horse.
fuck that.
that's not so bad.
nice.
pick up, eve.
the number you have reached
is not in service.
fuck.
shit.
you lost?
nope.
shit.
on your knees, slim.
okay, chow mein.
- who do you work for?
- fuck you, chelios.
fucking grunt.
you found me in quite an unpleasant
mood this morning, mate.
now, i'm gonna ask you this question
one time.
who's gots my fucking
strawberry tart?
capiche?
just spit the fucking name out.
johnny vang!
johnny fucking vang?
johnny fucking vang?
- good boy. where?
- cypress social club!
cypress- cypress social club.
now, you're sure about that, ain't you?
good boy. thanks for coming.
now, you can keep that.
fuck.
hello. doc miles.
yeah, doc, it's chev.
jesus h. chelios.
you gotta be kidding me.
listen. i'm deadly
fucking serious, doc.
these triad motherfuckers
cut out my fucking heart...
...and put in one of those
artificial jobs.
you got an artificial heart?
you think i'm having a fucking laugh?
no, but you gotta admit,
it's a little out there.
- you take your fucking time, doc.
- you don't have any time.
they're not designed to keep you alive
more than a couple of days.
- and don't do anything strenuous.
- yeah, sure, doc. no problem.
so, what's my next fucking move?
we gotta get a real heart put in you,
preferably your own.
- i'm on it.
- okay, you're on it.
- doc, jesus fucking christ!
- i'm sorry. sorry.
let me- does that thing
have a belt battery pack?
- check.
- how many bars are showing?
- one.
- shit. that's better than none, i guess.
look, what they did you with
is an avicor total artificial heart.
it's got an internal battery that'll
pick up once the belt battery dies.
it's like a reserve tank.
once the internal battery takes over,
you got one fucking hour.
the internal battery
charges wirelessly...
...through a transcutaneous
energy-transfer system.
two coils-
there's one internal, one external.
- that transmit via a magnetic force
across the skin...
...without piercing the surface.
the internal coil receives power
and sends it to the controller device.
does this make any fucking sense
to you, chevy?
it's fucking greek, doc.
greek.
look, you gotta keep your body
electrically charged...
- ... to keep that piece of shit pumping.
- copy that.
- hey, chev?
- yeah.
- i'm stoked you're alive, dude.
- i'll get back to you, doc.
yeah. call me.
fuck.
hey, hey, hey! that's a nice car.
don't suppose you know where
the cypress social club is, do you?
man, fuck that shit, puto.
let's race, ése.
don't you tempt me, fucker.
what i need from you is directions.
shit.
damn, dog. you good, ése?
tiger fucking woods.
never better.
greatest day of my fucking life.
you couldn't point me in the direction
of the cypress social club, could you?
well, you ain't too far.
go down orange for, like, 2 miles,
and then you're there, homes.
you mind giving me a jump?
just juice me.
anybody know
where's the fucking social club?
donde esta la social club?
buenos nachos, white boy.
this is a fucking social club?

of course.
who do you work for, and what
the fuck do they want with me?
el huron.
english. who's the fucking el huton?
it's the ferret.
he wants you alive,
so he can watch you die.
oh, yeah?
- why?
- i don't know.
doesn't everybody?
shut up.
you lucky bastard.
eve, let's go.
get on the floor now!
turn around.
oh, it's on now.
- no! stop! stop!
- put her down.
stop it!
no!
why didn't you call me?
like fuck i didn't.
didn't you get my message?
no. where have you been
for the last three months?
i thought you were dead.
i fell a mile out of a helicopter,
that's all. true story.
no way. you know what?
that's totally possible.
i saw this video on youtube...
...where this guy's parachute doesn't
open, he falls 14,000 feet...
...and he lives.
yes, baby, i know it's possible,
because i fucking did it!
- quit it.
- since when were you on the internet?
a lot of things have changed
since you died.
i didn't fucking die.
well, that's besides the point, isn't it?
hey!
- where are we going, chev?
- i don't know.
i need to find that slob from the club,
the one with the red cooler.
are you talking about johnny vang?
- you know johnny vang?
- i know his ass.
he's got the box with him all the time.
that box, i need it.
i can bet on my grandma's coochie
he's at the horse track.
dude, you gonna put johnny vang
on ice?
- maybe.
- that's so fucking sexy.
- fucking dead.
- didn't they cuff you?
damn it. do me.
i'll do you.

i got you, okay?
you gotta work for the things that-
- chevy?
- i lost the belt battery, doc.
- how long ago?
- over an hour.
jesus christ. that's not fucking
possible, chevy. you should be d-
fuck it. never mind. look.
it's a wireless system, so any low-level
electrical shock to your skin...
...should juice it at least temporarily.
hey, chev?
i'm a certified heart surgeon.
well, i was.
lost my license after i fucked up
my ex-wife's...
...vaginal rejuvenation procedure.
that's irrelevant right now.
the point is, if you can get your heart,
i'm sure i can put it back in for you.
i'll be in touch when i find that chinese
cocksucker that's got me pump.
bet you even had
to choose between-
chinese.
sharon, i just shut down, okay?
i couldn't think. i couldn't feel.
hey, chocolate? would you get
off your fat ass and get dressed?
why?
is doc miles gonna
have to choke a bitch?
you know that i was waiting
for those results too?
- i needed to put things in perspective.
- oh, you needed? you needed?
i think i know who we're dealing with.
hell no, we won't blow.
hell no, we won't suck.
hell no, we won't blow.

it's a matter of honor.
it should have been me
to avenge my brother's death.
well, so long, chelios.
my brain hurts.
there is one that i never got to,
on account of i could never find him.
- the one that calls himself the ferret.
- el huron?

- friction?
yeah. skin-on-skin contact
creates static electricity.
you're kidding me, right?
dude, the friction of two like objects
causes a transfer of electrons.
science 101, chevy.

- chev chelios.
- don motherfucking kim.
so you pull my lily-white ass
out of the hot grease again.
please, don't thank me.
i don't think i shall. i'm not sure
if you're aware of this, jeeves...
...but your slant-eyed associates
have taken something...
...of extreme value to me.
and i intend to get it back.
you know what you are,
chev chelios?
tell me.
you are a shit magnet.
your friend has the gay condition.
and now, where were we?
you were about to tell me
exactly who's got what i need and why.
you may have heard
of the name poon dong.
- only in dirty limericks.
- the patriarch of our organization.
said to be 100 years old.
considered to be more god than man
by the triad gangs.
but several months ago,
word had spread out...
...that poon dong
had taken gravely ill.
and without a heart transplant,
he only had a few days left to live.
- i see.
- of course, that was unacceptable.
many would have given their hearts...
...from their own breasts
to save the life of poon dong.
but not me. fuck that.
but many.
then word spread out
that there was a man...
...who had a heart so powerful
that he was capable...
...of surviving even our most deadliest
of poisons.
- the chinese shit.
- yes.
it was you, chev chelios.
it was your heart that poon dong
chose to replace his own.
one more question.
who the fuck is el huron, the ferret?
and how is he involved with all this?
the ferret?
let's just say our organizations
have a history of conflicting interests.
i see.
well, it's mighty white of you
to help me out like this.
now, if you don't mind.
who said i was helping you out?
my reward for returning you
to poon dong will be great.
- so this is how it is.
- this is how it is.
chicken and broccoli.
- dude, are you all right?
- never better.
fish halman here, bringing you
breaking on-the-scenes coverage...
...of an explosion of mayhem,
and lewd behavior...
...that has swept the long beach area.
our viewers may remember
a similar series of incidents...
...which took place
three months back...
...involving this unidentified man.
police are now confirming
that today's events...
...are the work
of that very same psychotic deviant.
ted garcia is standing by
in hollywood park with a live report.
- take it away, ted.
- thanks, fish.
i'm standing here
with a group of people-
families, seniors,
and degenerate gamblers.
- that are shocked and traumatized by
what they've witnessed here today...
...when what started as a sunny,
southern california afternoon...
...at the races turned, without warning,
into a public, open-air porno.
did you say porno, ted?
straight up, fish.
i'd like you to meet glenda lansing
of hawaiian gardens.
glenda says she had an all-too-
up-close-and-personal encounter...
...with the suspect just moments
before the shocking incident occurred.
that bastard had his filthy hands
all over me.
can you describe exactly
what happened?
i never saw a bastard
who wanted it so bad.
he put his filthy hands
on every part of me.
okay, that's a little too much
information for this broadcast.
can you describe
the man that assaulted you?
he looked like that fella
from the movies.
the t-bag.
t- bag?
you know, the trainspotted fella?
- built like a brick shit house.
- all right, ma'am.
you know that kind of language
is not gonna fly on tv.
that son of a bitch.
he treated me like his hot little whore.
explain to me...
...how you let this motherfucker
get away.
he just went buck wild
and killed everybody.
but not you.
i just got lucky, eh?
you know the drill, bitch.
do it.
do it!
now the other one.
you got yourself another chance.
i don't think you'll fuck it up next time.
now go get yourself a band-aid.
and go get me
fucking chelios, cabron!
that's the last time.
the last time that son of a bitch...
...leaves me with my ass in the wind
in front of 8,000 people!
- lemon. hey, hey, hey!
- randy?
- hi.
- what are you doing here?
it's about the dude.
what dude?
- the asshole.
- what about him?
he's on every channel. the guy's
a fucking psycho killer, baby.
every cop in this city's looking for him,
not to mention the fucking beaners.
- the fucking orientals.
- so?
so? so?
so the heat's on the street...
...and that dude's
playing for keeps, baby.
i have no idea
what the hell you just said.

if i ever catch you with another bitch...
well, you do got a big-ass dick
for a white boy.

i don't think it's safe
for you to be out there with that-
that sick fucko running wild right now.
- you can say that again.
- look, look.
listen to me.
here's what i think we should do.
- what, randy?
- all right, i say we go to the fuzz.
we tell them everything.
we come clean.
- what?
- the fuzz, all right?
i mean, i'd kill this guy myself,
but i got two strikes against me.
- let go of me.
- look, baby.
all right? i'm trying to be cool to you,
but i will drop the hammer.
you want me to drop the hammer,
baby?
i'm in no mood today, randy!

and talking with me...
...you made a choice
to confront your issues and lick them.
i can't even leave
my fucking apartment. i-
every time i go up to leave the door,
i see the guy with the gun.

your heart was transplanted
three weeks ago...
...into that shaolin motherfucker.

- i'm on it.
poon dong is still in l.a.
and if i'm right...
...he's got what you need in pristine,
working condition...
...beating inside his chest.

fuck you, chelios.
tell me what he's like
when he's at home.
when he's home, he's like a ghost.
he just plays those video games
all day, all night.
- video games?
- all day.
and you let him do that?
i mean, you did buy the games
for him, yeah?
of course.
why should i deny my son?
- how are you today, chev?
- i'm golden, sir.
your mom tells me that you've
been getting into quite a bit of trouble.
- is that true?
- yes, sir.
- regretfully, that's true.
- what kind of trouble?
fighting, talking back, pinching.
pinching what?
televisions, stereo components,
books from the library.
- that's not all.
- no, sir.
also a till from a restaurant
and one car.
- a toy car?
- no, sir.
a bmw z1.
hey, sit.
people, people, all right.
i hear you've been having
quite a bit of trouble at school too.
chelios.
nothing i can't handle, sir.
- i have a lot of piss and vinegar.
- he's hyperactive.
oh, shit, mom.
you want to watch your
dirty little mouth, son.
- we tried giving him ritalin, but-
- chev?
i sold it.
with all this energy,
you've never thought about...
...i don't know, trying out for sports?
- i like to run.
- chev, where's dad?
i never met the wanker.
he died before i was born.
what do you think he'd say
if he saw you acting out like this?
don't know, sir.
if he were here now,
and he asked you:
"why the bloody hell
do you do the things you do, son?"
- what would you tell him?
- don't know, sir.
- bored, i guess.
- bored, he guesses.
- bored? bored?
- shut up.
we're gonna take a short break now.
and when we return,
we are gonna find out...
...what makes you tick, little man.
hey.
you okay? wake up.
wake up.
ria, baby.
what happened to you?
what are you doing out here?
what you out here for?
i'm looking for the man
that killed my brother.
yeah.
i have to go.
i might not come back.
give the girls kisses
and hugs from me.
i kiss and hug all the pussy.
you go kill cocksucker.
some boyfriend you got there,
ms. lydon.
he lied to you
for six months regarding his work?
which i guess wouldn't be such
a big deal if he wasn't a hired killer.
he made you a target
for the south american mob...
...for kidnapping, torture, or worse.
he sexually humiliated you
in front of what...
...i don't know, half of los angeles?
twice.
twice. and then left you there
to take the rap?
and now you can add an arrest
and a police record...
...to a list of wonderful things
mr. chelios has brought to your life.
help me out here, sweetheart, okay?
because-
because i'm a little bit confused.
why the fuck do you continue
to protect this asshole?
that's a dicky question.
besides, i don't know
who you're talking about.
i mean, i'd like to see you fall
out of a helicopter and live.
what?
it looks like you made bail.
- great. can i have my stuff back?
- yeah.
yeah. just a-
just one little piece of advice.
wake the fuck up
and smell what's burning.
fuck.
hola, chev.
i take it you're the greasy fucker
that's been hunting me all day.
the ferret.
some people know me
by this fucking name.
and many men have died
cursing the name of el huron...
...as they choked on their own blood,
and the blood of their families.
colorful geezer.
i was born with another name.
the name of my father.
yeah, yeah, yeah. fucking hell.
and my father's father's.
we're all very sad.
and the name...
...that i share...
...with my two brothers...
...alejandro...
...ricardo...
verona.
oh, i can tell, while i dig, dig, dig...
...that you had no idea
that there was a third brother.
nope. that fact escaped me.
what i assure you of, is i would have
made it a fucking hat trick.
i got a trick or three for you, cabron.
i'm gonna make you wish
that you was never a man.
if you want to kill me,
you get on with it.
what's the rush, chelios?
i know someone
who's going to love to watch this.
you.
- you got the donor?
- like you got a boner.
hey, baby.
you always say you want
to be more spontaneous.
cowboy.
we gonna go back to my place.
- yeah.
- that sounds good.
ricardo never wanted
my money, chelios.
he was too stubborn.
wanted to make his own way.
now i think he likes
what my money can buy.
the technology to keep his brain alive.
not forever.
but long enough to watch you die.
yo, ferret. this ain't roots, man.
yeah?
hey, cabron.
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
you killed my brother, motherfucker.
prepare to die.
fuck you, chelios.
