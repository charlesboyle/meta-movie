mr. carey?
can i get a ride home?
okay, look, i know you
asked me for a ride home
to try to convince me
to change my mind.
but i can't do that.
i know it's hard, mister,
but maybe repeating 8th grade
is exactly what you need.
when you were offered after
school help, you refused it.
that's... that's fine.
that was your right.
we can't force it on you,
but now you have to accept the
consequences of that choice.
i can't pass you.
but i am willing to do
what i can to help you.
it's plain to see that you need it.
fuck you.
get the hell out of my car!
yo, what about my son, man?
what about your son?
it's just me and him.
let me go.
you can't lock me up.
i'm all he's got.
man, don't worry about your son.
if you cooperate, then maybe
your ass will see him later.
they're gonna take care
of him over at riverview.
riverview? hell, no!
hey!
daddy, don't let them take me!
don't let them take me there!
tj, relax. take care.
look, man, you trying to take my
son and put him in the system?
go ahead. watch your feet.
get in!
was he beating up on you?
did he hit you?
yeah, he hit me.
he hit you?
okay, that... i mean,
that's domestic violence.
listen,
i need to talk to you
about the acting
auditions on august 7th.
remember i told you about the
tv show in beverly hills?
the auditions are downtown,
and how you're gonna take me to
the auditions and you would...
yeah, i know, mister.
why is pete in my room
on my playstation?
yo!
go get something for dinner.
you don't you have any real money?
this is real money, mister.
straight up, i'm not
babysitting, dude.
mister, take pete with you.
what you looking at, chopstick?
what'd you say to him?
i didn't say anything. he stole.
what?
he stole.
shut up.
and who told you to play
with my playstation, anyway?
don't ever touch my stuff.
denied. insufficient funds.
what?
the card is out of money.
i will need another
form of payment.
fuck that.
excuse me? again, please.
nothing. just give
me back the card.
you know what?
i think i'll give it
to its rightful owner.
but it's my mom's, yo.
first of all, i am not your "yo".
second, tell your mom to come
and get it if she wants it.
but not you.
you are banned.
banned?
banned for what?
just leave before i
call the police.
but i didn't do...
leave!
why are you banned?
why are you banned, mister?
that's him.
the one who stole.
yo, you don't snitch, all right?
but stealing's wrong.
look, people do what they have
to do to survive out here.
it's candy.
what are you talking about?
it's candy.
i heard you, man.
annoying as hell. damn!
stay here.
the card is out of money.
what?
the welfare card.
dude at the store said you
have to come and get it.
where's peter?
i don't know. somewhere.
i'm right here, mister.
why's he here anyway?
if i'm babysitting, his mom's
is gonna pay me for real.
she give you money to pay me?
we're going out to eat.
what?
go clean up. we're going to eat.
we don't have money
to go out to eat!
hey!
don't talk to me like that.
how are you, peter?
good. thanks.
how was school today, mister?
same as always.
it was the last day, right?
guess you're a freshman now.
you know curtis from our building?
what about him?
he got nabbed today.
he did?
what for?
what do you think?
they took his son to riverview.
dude's like my age.
i always heard curtis was
into some bad stuff.
he should have known his
ass would end up in jail.
he works for the same
drug-dealing pimp you work for.
eat your cheeseburger, mister.
and what about his son?
he's stuck at the worst
group home in the world.
he deserves that because
his pop's a screw-up?
jesus, would you eat your
goddamn food and shut up?
i'll be back in a minute.
yeah.
yeah.
why're you here?
eat the rest.
that's okay.
i'm... i'm full.
eat the rest. now!
let's go.
no. pete's not done.
he's not wasting that food.
he can take it with him, mister.
he's not taking it with him.
he's eating it now!
finish it!
what the hell is wrong with you?
what the hell is wrong with you?
sucking dick in the bathroom!
keep the change.
think big.
think positive.
always go for the throat.
buy low, sell high.
fear? that's the
other guy's problem.
nothing you have ever experienced
will prepare you for the absolute
carnage you are about to witness.
super bowl, world series,
they don't know what pressure is.
in this building, it's
either kill or be killed.
you make no friends in the pits
and you take no prisoners.
one minute you're up half
a million in soybeans
and the next, boom, your
kids don't go to college
and they've repossessed your
bentley. are you with me?
yeah, we got to kill the motherf...
we got to kill 'em!
they want you to buy
as much oj as you can,
the instant trading stock.
stay here.
i'll be back.
is it all right if i have
some water maybe?
man, i don't care.
hey, do me a favor.
what?
run in there and get me a paper.
for what?
to read, why else?
where that chinese nigga at?
he's not chinese.
where he at?
why?
because i don't like
him, that's why.
something fishy about that nigga.
man, whatever, yo.
why you can't just go in
there and get it yourself?
man, what's with all
the questions, man?
you gonna help me out or not?
i ain't gonna be your paperboy and
shit. how's that supposed to look?
man, whatever, dip stick.
what? what you call me?
punk motherfucker!
hey, what do you
think you're doing?
oh, okay.
we'll see!
we'll see!
we're out of cereal and
milk and everything.
take the card and go to the store.
i told you.
dude at the store took it.
you have to go get it.
i circled the ones you can do.
they probably don't care
about background checks.
this is what you think of me?
i wasn't about to circle rocket
scientist if that's what you mean.
mister, what's your problem?
my problem?
you are gonna stop talking to
me like i'm your goddamn child.
i'm your mother.
you think i'm satisfied
with this life?
i'm not.
i'm just trying to
get things in order.
you been saying that
for how long now?
i'm sick of hearing it.
you know what i'm sick of?
i'm sick of you.
you and your smartass mouth.
you keep on talking shit,
i'm gonna kick your
nappy-head ass out for good.
what's the difference?
i'll be better off.
that's the shit i'm talking about.
you just know
everything, don't you?
don't you?
i do what i do
'cause ain't nobody gonna help me.
they never have.
they never will.
mister,
take pete and go.
you're disgusting.
i wish you would just die already.
at least we have that in common.
take pete and go.
that's b-ball.
b-ball?
like basketball?
no, like bernard ball.
that's his name.
stay right here, right next to him.
why?
so no one messes with you.
can't i come with you, mister?
hell, no!
why is he staring at you like that?
he always does that.
in like 10 minutes, head back up.
she probably won't even
know you're there.
grab some jelly from the fridge,
grab some bread, make a sandwich.
alice.
come for a ride with me, mister.
what's up, alice?
let's go for a ride.
i got my board.
i see. you got something
better going on or what?

i can kick it with
you for a minute.

she's probably asleep.
she works nights, so...
i saw you when i was
getting ready for my run.

when i was skating?
i thought maybe that was you.
i see you out there
every saturday, mister.
you wanna know who that
man i was with is?

time and i'll fuck your shit up!

stuff on the plane to beverly hills.

housing authority catches
us out here, that's a wrap.

it another day or two.

two kids shopping for groceries
in the middle of the night.
but where we're from,
you don't want people seeing
what you bring into your home.
they'll rob you blind for a
carton of milk if they have to.
so, we shop while they sleep.
plus my mom, she works two jobs
and she doesn't have time.
and tomorrow is her birthday.
i wanted to get groceries and have a
big breakfast for when she comes home.
i just wanted to do one thing
so she'd have one less
thing to worry about.
tell your mom happy birthday.
thanks.

all about you, mister.
alice! hold on. wait!
wait...
we're looking at one or two thunderstorms
developing as the day goes on.
temperatures by then
in the mid-nineties.
so it looks like august
is going to start
just as hot as july ended.
unfortunately the summer
heat wave continues
and shows no signs of letting up.
mister, open the door.
i'm sorry.
no, no, no. don't open that.
you wanna help me
clean it up, pete?
okay. but can i finish
my food first, please?
i want to bring you some stuff.
i'll even let you pay me back.
- why?
- why? why what?
why do you keep trying to help me?
you are my friend, got it?
so don't ever make me feel bad
for wanting to help you again.
you're gonna miss me
when i'm in beverly hills.
i know you're not moving, mister.
i am.
me and pete. august 7th.
so you'll be here in a
couple hours, then?
you can come, too.
as fun as that sounds,
i can't come with you.
why?
what is it?
he wants me to move in with him.
you're not doing that, are you?
he already left his wife and kids.
he's married?
hell, no, alice.
i know...
i'm going to tell him no.
i'm leaving him.
he left his family for you.
i never asked.
it's my life, not his.
i want to find my own way.
want me to come with you?
thanks, mister, but i got it.
when is your mom coming home?
they let her out of
jail over a month ago.
if she was coming back,
she probably would have by now.
mister, how did you...
what are you going to do?
i told you.
i'm going to beverly hills.
i'll be back in an hour or two.
i'll be back.
muah! muah!
muah! muah!
what are you laughing at?
is she coming?
she'll be back.
is she coming today?
i don't know.
probably not.
you think it's because
you kissed her?
why do you ask so many questions?
i mean, you talk more than
anybody else in the world.
you talk more than me.
nobody talks more than you.
you do.
"yo this" and "yo that".
i don't say "yo" a lot.
i don't feel very well.
do we have any food left?
hey, lock the door behind me.
i'll be back in a minute.
but we can't go outside.
henry!

mister is being released to you
with the understanding that

a couple of incidents, but
he was protecting a friend.
he barely had time to settle in.
he's been here all summer
and didn't settle in?
no.
no?
he's only been with us two weeks.
where was he before that?
i don't know.
all i know is housing authority
picked him up from home.
when i was arrested they told me
that he would be brought here.
i thought he was safe. i thought
he was... i thought he was here.
our records show that you were
released over two months ago.
if you were so concerned
about mister,
even if you believed he was here,
i was making sure the
next time i saw him,
i could look him in the eye.
can you?
hey!
is that your mom?
yeah.
i'll be back for you.
promise?
i promise.
you're strong, pete.
don't let anybody punk you.

i'll see you soon.
hi, mister.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
okay.
we are going to jump right into it.
i want you all to write about
what you did this summer, okay?
i want you to be as detailed
as you possibly can.
make it at least one
page long, okay?
and i want you to take the
whole period to do it.
if you took a trip this summer,
i wanna know about it.
i wanna know where you
went, who you went with.
anything you remember.
think about the last three months.
as much as you can.
what did you do, say,
on the 4th of july?
okay, did anybody in your
family have a birthday?
are there any good books
that you read this summer?
