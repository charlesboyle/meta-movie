did you hear that?
they shut down the main reactor.
we'll be destroyed for sure.
this is madness.
we're doomed.
there'll be no escape
for the princess this time.
what's that?
r2-d2, where are you?
at last. where have you been?
they're heading in this direction.
what are we going to do?
we'll be sent to the kessel spice mines
or smashed into who knows what.
wait a minute. where are you going?
the death star plans
are not in the main computer.
where are those transmissions
you intercepted?
what have you done with those plans?
we intercepted no transmissions.
this is a consular ship.
we're on a diplomatic mission.
if this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?
commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans!
and bring me the passengers!
i want them alive!
there's one. set for stun.
she'll be all right.
inform lord vader we have a prisoner.
hey. you're not permitted in there.
it's restricted.
you'll be deactivated for sure.
don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.
come out, before somebody sees you.
secret mission? what plans?
what are you talking about?
i'm not getting in there.
i'm going to regret this.
- there goes another one.
- hold your fire. there's no life-forms.
it must have short-circuited.
that's funny. the damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.
are you sure this thing is safe?
darth vader. only you could be so bold.
the imperial senate will not sit still for this.
when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...
don't act so surprised, your highness.
you weren't on
any mercy mission this time.
several transmissions
were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.
i want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.
i don't know what you're talking about.
i'm a member of the imperial senate
on a diplomatic mission to alderaan.
you are part of the rebel alliance
and a traitor.
take her away!
holding her is dangerous.
if word of this gets out, it could generate
sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.
i have traced the rebel spies to her.
now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.
she'll die before
she'll tell you anything.
leave that to me.
send a distress signal, and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed.
lord vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship...
and no transmissions were made.
an escape pod was jettisoned during the
fighting, but no life-forms were aboard.
she must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.
send a detachment down to retrieve them.
see to it personally, commander.
there'll be no one to stop us this time.
yes, sir.
how did we get into this mess?
i really don't know how.
we seem to be made to suffer.
it's our lot in life.
i've got to rest before i fall apart.
my joints are almost frozen.
what a desolate place this is.
where do you think you're going?
well, i'm not going that way.
it's much too rocky.
this way is much easier.
what makes you think
there are settlements over there?
don't get technical with me.
what mission? what are you talking about?
i've just about had enough of you.
go that way.
you'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.
and don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help...
because you won't get it.
no more adventures.
i'm not going that way.
that malfunctioning little twerp.
this is all his fault.
he tricked me into going this way...
but he'll do no better.
wait. what's that?
a transport. i'm saved.
over here!
hey! hey!
help! please help!
r2?
r2-d2, it is you! it is you!
someone was in the pod.
the tracks go off in this direction.
look, sir. droids.
we stopped.
wake up. wake up!
we're doomed.
do you think they'll melt us down?
don't shoot. don't shoot.
will this never end?
- fine. let's go.
- luke!
luke!
luke, tell your uncle if he gets a
translator, be sure it speaks bocce.
doesn't look like we have much choice,
but i'll remind him.
yeah, we'll take that red one.
no, not that one.
you. i suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.
protocol? it's my primary function, sir.
i am well-versed in all the customs...
- i have no need for a protocol droid.
- of course you haven't, sir.
not in an environment such as this.
that's why i have been programmed...
i need a droid who understands
the binary language of moisture vaporators.
vaporators? sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.
- can you speak bocce?
- of course. it's like a second language.
- all right. shut up. i'll take this one.
- shutting up, sir.
luke!
take these two to the garage.
i want them cleaned up before dinner.
but i was going into tosche station
to pick up some power converters.
you can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.
now come on. get to it.
all right. come on.
and the red one. come on.
come on, red. let's go.
- uncle owen.
- yeah?
this r2 unit has a bad motivator. look.
hey, what are you trying to push on us?
excuse me, sir, but that r2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.
uncle owen, what about that one?
what about that blue one?
we'll take that one.
take this away.
you'll be pleased with that one, sir.
he really is in first-class condition.
i've worked with him before.
here he comes.
okay. let's go.
don't you forget this.
why i should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.
thank the maker.
this oil bath is going to feel so good.
i've got such a bad case of dust
contamination, i can barely move.
it just isn't fair.
biggs is right.
i'm never gonna get out of here.
is there anything i might do to help?
no, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest...
or teleport me off this rock.
i don't think so, sir.
i'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable
about such things.
not on this planet, anyway.
as a matter of fact,
i'm not even sure which planet i'm on.
well, if there's a bright center
to the universe...
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.
i see, sir.
- you can call me luke.
- i see, sir luke.
just luke.
and i am c-3po, human-cyborg relations.
and this is my counterpart, r2-d2.
hello.
you got a lot of carbon scoring here.
looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
with all we've been through...
sometimes i'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are...
what with the rebellion and all.
you know of the rebellion
against the empire?
that's how we came to be in your service,
if you take my meaning, sir.
- have you been in many battles?
- several, i think.
there's not much to tell.
i'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.
well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.
well, my little friend...
you got something jammed
in here real good.
were you on a starcruiser or...
help me, obi-wan kenobi.
you're my only hope.
what's this?
"what is what"?
he asked you a question. what is that?
help me, obi-wan kenobi.
you're my only hope.
help me, obi-wan kenobi.
you're my only hope.
he says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.
old data. pay it no mind.
who is she? she's beautiful.
i'm afraid i'm not quite sure, sir.
i think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.
a person of some importance, i believe.
- our captain was...
- is there any more to this recording?
behave yourself, r2.
you're going to get us into trouble.
it's all right. you can trust him.
he's our new master.
you're my only hope.
he says he's the property of obi-wan
kenobi, a resident of these parts...
and it's a private message for him.
frankly, i don't know
what he's talking about.
our last master was captain antilles.
but with all we've been through,
this r2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
obi-wan kenobi.
i wonder if he means old ben kenobi.
i beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?
i don't know anyone named obi-wan...
but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea.
he's kind of a strange old hermit.
i wonder who she is.
sounds like she's in trouble.
i better play back the whole thing.
he says the restraining bolt has
short-circuited his recording system.
he suggests that if you remove the bolt...
he might be able to play back
the entire recording.
oh, yeah. well...
i guess you're too small
to run away on me if i take this off.
okay.
there you go.
where'd she go? bring her back.
play back the entire message.
"what message"?
the one you've just been playing.
the one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.
luke! luke!
i'll be right there, aunt beru.
i'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.
here. see what you can do with him.
i'll be right back.
just you reconsider
playing that message for him.
no, i don't think he likes you at all.
no, i don't like you either.
- i think that r2 unit might have been stolen.
- what makes you think that?
i stumbled across a recording
while i was cleaning him.
he says he belongs to someone
called obi-wan kenobi.
i thought he might have meant old ben.
do you know what he's talking about?
i wonder if he's related to ben.
that wizard's just a crazy old man.
tomorrow, take that r2 unit to anchorhead
and have its memory erased.
that'll be the end of it.
it belongs to us now.
but what if this obi-wan
comes looking for him?
he won't.
i don't think he exists anymore.
he died about the same time as your father.
- he knew my father?
- i told you to forget it.
your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.
in the morning, i want them on the south
ridge, working on those condensers.
yes, sir.
i think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.
in fact, i was also thinking
about our agreement...
about me staying on another season.
if these new droids work out,
i want to apply to the academy this year.
you mean the next semester
before the harvest?
sure. there's more than enough droids.
harvest is when i need you the most.
it's only one season more.
this year we'll make enough
on the harvest to hire more hands...
and then you can go
to the academy next year.
you must understand i need you here, luke.
- but it's a whole 'nother year.
- it's only one more season.
that's what you said
when biggs and tank left.
- where are you going?
- looks like i'm going nowhere.
i have to go finish cleaning those droids.
owen, he can't stay here forever.
most of his friends have gone.
it means so much to him.
i'll make it up to him next year.
i promise.
luke's just not a farmer, owen.
he has too much of his father in him.
that's what i'm afraid of.
- what are you doing hiding back there?
- it wasn't my fault, sir.
please don't deactivate me.
i told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.
- kept babbling on about his mission.
- oh, no.
that r2 unit has always been a problem.
these astro droids
are getting quite out of hand.
even i can't understand
their logic at times.
how could i be so stupid?
he's nowhere in sight.
blast it!
pardon me, sir, but
couldn't we go after him?
it's too dangerous with the sandpeople around.
we'll have to wait till morning.
luke, i'm shutting the power down.
i'll be there in a few minutes.
boy, am i gonna get it.
that little droid's gonna cause me
a lot of trouble.
he excels at that, sir.
come on.
have you seen luke this morning?
he said he had things to do before
he started today, so he left early.
- did he take those new droids with him?
- i think so.
he better have those units in
the south range repaired by midday...
or there'll be hell to pay.
there's a droid on the scanner.
dead ahead.
it might be our little r2 unit.
hit the accelerator.
where do you think you're going?
master luke is your rightful owner now.
we'll have no more
of this obi-wan kenobi gibberish.
don't talk to me of your mission either.
you're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here.
no. it's all right,
but i think we'd better go.
what's wrong with him now?
there are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.
sandpeople. or worse.
come on. let's go have a look.
come on.
well, there are two banthas down there,
but i don't see any...
wait a second.
they're sandpeople, all right.
i can see one of them now.
hello there.
come here, my little friend.
don't be afraid.
don't worry. he'll be all right.
rest easy, son. you've had a busy day.
you're fortunate to be all in one piece.
ben? ben kenobi?
boy, am i glad to see you.
the jundland wastes
are not to be traveled lightly.
tell me, young luke,
what brings you out this far?
this little droid.
i think he's searching
for his former master...
but i've never seen
such devotion in a droid before.
he claims to be the property
of an obi-wan kenobi.
is he a relative of yours?
do you know who he's talking about?
obi-wan kenobi?
obi-wan.
now, that's a name
i've not heard in a long time.
a long time.
i think my uncle knows him.
he said he was dead.
he's not dead.
not yet.
- you know him?
- of course i know him.
he's me.
i haven't gone by the name of obi-wan...
since, oh, before you were born.
then the droid does belong to you.
i don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.
very interesting.
i think we better get indoors.
the sandpeople are easily startled...
but they'll soon be back...
and in greater numbers.
where am i? i must have taken a bad step.
can you stand? we've gotta get out
of here before the sandpeople return.
i don't think i can make it.
you go on, master luke.
there's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account. i'm done for.
no, you're not. what kind of talk is that?
quickly. they're on the move.
my father didn't fight in the wars.
he was a navigator on a spice freighter.
that's what your uncle told you.
he didn't hold with your father's ideals.
thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.
- you fought in the clone wars?
- yes.
i was once a jedi knight,
the same as your father.
i wish i'd known him.
he was the best starpilot in the galaxy...
and a cunning warrior.
i understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.
and he was a good friend.
which reminds me...
i have something here for you.
your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.
he feared you might follow old obi-wan...
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade,
like your father did.
sir, if you'll not be needing me,
i'll close down for a while.
sure. go ahead.
- what is it?
- your father's lightsaber.
this is the weapon of a jedi knight.
not as clumsy or random as a blaster.
an elegant weapon...
for a more civilized age.
for over a thousand generations,
the jedi knights...
were the guardians of
peace and justice in the old republic...
before the dark times...
before the empire.
how did my father die?
a young jedi named darth vader...
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...
helped the empire hunt down
and destroy the jedi knights.
he betrayed and murdered your father.
now the jedi are all but extinct.
vader was seduced
by the dark side of the force.
the force?
the force is what gives a jedi his power.
it's an energy field
created by all living things.
it surrounds us and penetrates us.
it binds the galaxy together.
let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend...
and where you come from.
- i saw part of a message...
- i seem to have found it.
general kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the clone wars.
now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the empire.
i regret that i am unable to present
my father's request in person.
but my ship has fallen under attack...
and i'm afraid my mission
to bring you to alderaan has failed.
i have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion...
into the memory systems of this r2 unit.
my father will know how to retrieve it.
you must see this droid
safely delivered to him on alderaan.
this is our most desperate hour.
help me, obi-wan kenobi.
you're my only hope.
you must learn the ways of the force
if you're to come with me to alderaan.
alderaan?
i'm not going to alderaan.
i've gotta get home.
it's late. i'm in for it as it is.
i need your help, luke.
she needs your help.
i'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.
i can't get involved. i've got work to do.
it's not that i like the empire.
i hate it.
but there's nothing
i can do about it right now.
- it's all such a long way from here.
- that's your uncle talking.
oh, boy. my uncle.
how am i ever gonna explain this?
learn about the force, luke.
i can take you as far as anchorhead.
you can get a transport there
to mos eisley or wherever you're going.
you must do what you feel
is right, of course.
until this battle station is fully
operational, we are vulnerable.
the rebel alliance is too well equipped.
they're more dangerous than you realize.
dangerous to your starfleet, commander...
not to this battle station.
the rebellion will continue to
gain support in the imperial senate...
the imperial senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.
i've just received word that the emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.
the last remnants of the old republic
have been swept away.
that's impossible.
how will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?
the regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.
fear will keep the local systems in line.
fear of this battle station.
and what of the rebellion?
if the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station...
it is possible, however unlikely...
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.
the plans you refer to
will soon be back in our hands.
any attack by the rebels against this
station would be a useless gesture...
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.
this station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.
i suggest we use it.
don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've constructed.
the ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant...
next to the power of the force.
don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, lord vader.
your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortress...
i find your lack of faith disturbing.
enough of this. vader, release him.
as you wish.
this bickering is pointless.
lord vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...
by the time this station is operational.
we will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.
it looks like the sandpeople did this.
there's gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.
i've just never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.
they didn't, but we are
meant to think they did.
these tracks are side-by-side.
sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.
these are the same jawas
that sold us r2 and 3po.
and these blast points,
too accurate for sandpeople.
only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.
but why would imperial troops
want to slaughter jawas?
if they traced the robots here, they may
have learned who they sold them to...
and that would lead them back... home.
wait, luke.
it's too dangerous.
uncle owen.
aunt beru.
uncle owen.
now, your highness, we will discuss
the location of your hidden rebel base.
there's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.
you'd have been killed too...
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the empire.
i want to come with you to alderaan.
there's nothing for me here now.
i want to learn the ways of the force
and become a jedi like my father.
mos eisley spaceport.
you will never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy.
we must be cautious.
how long have you had these droids?
- three or four seasons.
- they're up for sale if you want them.
let me see your identification.
you don't need to see his identification.
we don't need to see his identification.
these aren't the droids
you're looking for.
these aren't the droids we're looking for.
he can go about his business.
- you can go about your business.
- move along.
move along. move along.
i can't abide those jawas.
disgusting creatures.
go on, go on.
i can't understand how we got by those troops.
i thought we were dead.
the force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.
you really think we're gonna find
a pilot here to take us to alderaan?
most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here.
only watch your step...
this place can be a little rough.
i'm ready for anything.
come along, r2.
- hey. we don't serve their kind here.
- what?
your droids... they'll have to wait outside.
we don't want them here.
wait out by the speeder.
we don't want any trouble.
i heartily agree with you, sir.
i'll have one of those.
- he doesn't like you.
- i'm sorry.
i don't like you either.
you just watch yourself.
we're wanted men.
i have the death sentence on 12 systems.
- i'll be careful then.
- you'll be dead!
this little one's not worth the effort.
come, let me get you something.
i'm all right.
chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.
i don't like the look of this.
han solo. i'm captain
of the millennium falcon.
chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the alderaan system.
yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.
fast ship? you've never heard of
the millennium falcon?
should i have?
it's the ship that made the kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.
i've outrun imperial starships.
not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.
i'm talking about
the big corellian ships now.
she's fast enough for you, old man.
- what's the cargo?
- only passengers...
myself, the boy, two droids...
and no questions asked.
is it some kind of local trouble?
let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.
well, that's the real trick, isn't it?
and it's gonna cost you something extra.
we could almost buy our own ship for that.
but who's gonna fly it, kid? you?
you bet i could. i'm not such a bad pilot.
we don't have to sit here and listen...
we can pay you 2,000 now...
plus 15 when we reach alderaan.
seventeen?
okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.
we'll leave as soon as you're ready.
docking bay 94.
ninety-four.
looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.
all right. we'll check it out.
must really be desperate.
this could really save my neck.
get back to the ship, get it ready.
- you'll have to sell your speeder.
- that's okay.
i'm never coming back
to this planet again.
going somewhere, solo?
yes, greedo. as a matter of fact,
i was just going to see your boss.
tell jabba that i've got his money.
it's too late.
you should have paid him
when you had the chance.
jabba's put a price on
your head so large...
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you...
i'm lucky i found you first.
yeah, but this time i've got the money.
if you give it to me, i
might forget i found you.
i don't have it with me. tell jabba...
jabba's through with you.
he has no time for smugglers...
who drop their shipments
at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.
even i get boarded sometimes.
do you think i had a choice?
you can tell that to jabba.
he may only take your ship.
over my dead body.
that's the idea.
i've been looking forward
to this for a long time.
i'll bet you have.
sorry about the mess.
her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.
it'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.
the final checkout is completed.
all systems are operational.
what course shall we set?
perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.
what do you mean?
i think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.
- set your course for alderaan.
- with pleasure.
lock the door, r2.
check this side of the street.
the door's locked.
move on to the next one.
i would much rather have gone with
master luke than stay here with you.
i don't know what this trouble is about,
but i'm sure it must be your fault.
you watch your language.
all right. give it to me. i'll take it.
look at this. ever since the xp-38
came out, they just aren't in demand.
it'll be enough.
solo! come out of there, solo!
right here, jabba.
i've been waitin' for you.
have you now.
you didn't think i was gonna run, did you?
han, my boy, you disappoint me.
why haven't you paid me...
and why did you fry poor greedo?
jabba, next time you wanna talk to me,
come see me yourself.
don't send one of these twerps.
han, i can't make exceptions.
what if everyone who smuggled for me...
dropped their cargo at the first sign...
of an imperial starship?
it's not good business.
look, jabba, even i get boarded sometimes.
you think i had a choice?
but i got a nice, easy charter.
i'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
i just need a little more time.
han, my boy, you're the best.
so, for an extra twenty percent...
fifteen, jabba. don't push it.
okay, fifteen percent.
but if you fail me again...
i'll put a price on your head so big...
you won't be able to go
near a civilized system.
jabba, you're a wonderful human being.
come on!
if the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.
what a piece of junk.
she'll make .5 past light speed.
she may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.
i've made a lot of special
modifications myself.
but we're a little rushed, so if you'll
just get on board, we'll get outta here.
hello, sir.
which way?
all right, men, load your weapons.
stop that ship. blast them.
chewie, get us out of here!
oh, my. i'd forgotten
how much i hate space travel.
looks like an imperial cruiser.
our passengers are hotter than i thought.
hold 'em off.
angle the deflector shields...
while i make the calculations
for the jump to light speed.
stay sharp. there's two more comin' in.
they're gonna try and cut us off.
why don't you outrun 'em?
you said this thing was fast.
watch your mouth or you're gonna
find yourself floating home.
we'll be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace.
besides, i know a few maneuvers.
we'll lose 'em.
here's where the fun begins.
how long before you can
jump to light speed?
it'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.
are you kidding?
at the rate they're gaining?
traveling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy.
without precise calculations,
we'd fly right through a star...
or bounce too close to a supernova,
and that would end your trip real quick.
- what's that flashing?
- we're losing a deflector shield.
go strap yourselves in.
i'm gonna make the jump to light speed.
we've entered the alderaan system.
governor tarkin. i should have expected
to find you holding vader's leash.
i recognized your foul stench
when i was brought on board.
charming to the last.
you don't know how hard i found it...
signing the order to terminate your life.
i'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.
princess leia, before your execution...
i would like you to be my guest
at a ceremony...
that will make
this battle station operational.
no star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.
the more you tighten your grip, tarkin...
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.
not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.
in a way, you have determined
the choice of the planet...
that'll be destroyed first.
since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base...
i have chosen to test
this station's destructive power...
on your home planet of alderaan.
no. alderaan is peaceful.
we have no weapons.
you would prefer another target?
a military target?
then name the system.
i grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.
where is the rebel base?
dantooine.
they're on dantooine.
there. you see, lord vader?
she can be reasonable.
continue with the operation.
you may fire when ready.
- what?
- you're far too trusting.
dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.
but don't worry. we will deal with
your rebel friends soon enough.
commence primary ignition.
are you all right? what's wrong?
i felt a great disturbance in the force...
as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror...
and were suddenly silenced.
i fear something terrible has happened.
you'd better get on with your exercises.
you can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.
i told you i'd outrun them.
don't everybody thank me at once.
anyway, we should be at alderaan
about 0200 hours.
now be careful, r2.
he made a fair move.
screaming about it can't help you.
let him have it.
it's not wise to upset a wookiee.
but, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.
that's 'cause a droid don't pull people's
arms out of their sockets when they lose.
wookiees are known to do that.
i see your point, sir.
i suggest a new strategy, r2.
let the wookiee win.
remember, a jedi can feel the force
flowing through him.
- you mean it controls your actions?
- partially.
but it also obeys your commands.
hokey religions and ancient weapons are
no match for a blaster at your side, kid.
you don't believe in the force, do you?
kid, i've flown from one side
of this galaxy to the other.
i've seen a lot of strange stuff...
but i've never seen anything
to make me believe...
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.
there's no mystical energy field
controls my destiny.
it's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.
i suggest you try it again, luke.
this time, let go your conscious self...
and act on instinct.
with the blast shield down, i can't see.
how am i supposed to fight?
your eyes can deceive you.
don't trust them.
stretch out with your feelings.
you see? you can do it.
i call it luck.
in my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.
good against remotes is one thing.
good against the living,
that's something else.
we're coming up on alderaan.
i did feel something.
i could almost see the remote.
that's good. you've taken
your first step into a larger world.
yes?
our scout ships have reached dantooine.
they found the remains of a rebel base...
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.
they are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.
she lied. she lied to us.
i told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.
terminate her immediately.
stand by, chewie. here we go.
cut in the sublight engines.
what the...
we've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower...
some kind of asteroid collision.
- it's not on any of the charts.
- what's going on?
our position's correct,
except no alderaan.
- where is it?
- that's what i'm trying to tell you.
it ain't there. it's been blown away.
- what? how?
- destroyed by the empire.
the entire starfleet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.
it'd take a thousand ships
with more firepower than i've...
- there's another ship coming in.
- maybe they know what happened.
it's an imperial fighter.
- it followed us.
- no. it's a short-range fighter.
there aren't any bases around here.
where did it come from?
sure is leaving in a hurry.
if they identify us, we're in trouble.
not if i can help it.
chewie, jam its transmissions.
- let it go. it's too far out of range.
- not for long.
a fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.
he must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.
he ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.
he's heading for that small moon.
i can get him before he gets there.
he's almost in range.
that's no moon.
- it's a space station.
- it's too big to be a space station.
i have a very bad feeling about this.
turn the ship around.
yeah. i think you're right. full reverse.
chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
why are we still moving towards it?
we're caught in a tractor beam.
it's pulling us in.
there's gotta be something you can do.
there's nothing i can do.
i'm at full power. i have to shut down.
they're not gonna get me without a fight.
you can't win, but there are
alternatives to fighting.
clear bay 327.
we are opening the magnetic field.
to your stations. come with me.
close all outboard shields.
close all outboard shields.
yes?
we've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the alderaan system.
its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of mos eisley.
they must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.
she may yet be of some use to us.
unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9. release charge.
there's no one on board, sir.
according to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.
it must be a decoy.
several escape pods have been jettisoned.
- did you find any droids?
- no, sir.
if there were any,
they must also have jettisoned.
send a scanning crew aboard.
i want every part of this ship checked.
yes, sir.
i sense something...
a presence i've not felt since...
get me a scanning crew in here.
i want every part of this ship checked.
there's no one here.
boy, it's lucky you have
these compartments.
i use them for smuggling. i never
thought i'd be smuggling myself in 'em.
this is ridiculous.
even if i could take off,
i'd never get past the tractor beam.
leave that to me.
damn fool. i knew you were gonna say that.
who's the more foolish,
the fool or the fool who follows him?
the ship's all yours. if the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.
all right. let's go.
hey, down there.
could you give us a hand with this?
tk-421, why aren't you at your post?
tk-421, do you copy?
take over. we've got a bad transmitter.
i'll see what i can do.
between his howling
and your blasting everything...
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.
bring 'em on. i prefer a straight fight
to sneakin' around.
we've found the computer outlet, sir.
plug in. he should be able to
interpret the entire imperial network.
he's found the controls to the power beam
that's holding the ship here.
he'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.
the tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.
a power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.
i don't think you boys can help.
i must go alone.
whatever you say. i've done more than
i bargained for on this trip already.
- i want to go with you.
- be patient, luke. watch the droids.
they must be delivered safely...
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as alderaan.
your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.
the force will be with you...
always.
you said it, chewie.
where did you dig up that old fossil?
ben is a great man.
- great at getting us into trouble.
- i didn't hear you give any ideas.
anything's better than just hangin'
around waiting for 'em to pick us up.
who do you think...
- what is it?
- i'm afraid i'm not quite sure, sir.
he says, "i've found her,"
and keeps repeating, "she's here."
who? who has he found?
- princess leia.
- the princess? she's here?
- princess?
- where is she?
princess? what's going on?
level 5, detention block aa-23.
i'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.
oh, no. we've gotta do something.
- what are you talking about?
- the droids belong to her.
she's the one in the message.
we gotta help her.
don't get any funny ideas.
the old man wants us to wait here.
he didn't know she was here.
find a way into that detention block.
- i'm not going anywhere.
- they're gonna execute her.
you said you didn't want to just wait
to be captured. now you want to stay?
marching into the detention area
is not what i had in mind.
- but they're gonna kill her.
- better her than me.
she's rich.
rich?
rich, powerful. if you were to
rescue her, the reward would be...
- what?
- well, more well than you can imagine.
i don't know. i can imagine quite a bit.
- you'll get it.
- i better.
you will.
all right, kid.
you better be right about this.
- all right.
- what's your plan?
will you?
okay.
now, i'm gonna put these on you.
okay, han, you put those on.
don't worry, chewie.
i think i know what he has in mind.
master luke, sir, pardon me for asking...
but what should r2 and i do
if we're discovered here?
- lock the door.
- and hope they don't have blasters.
that isn't very reassuring.
i can't see a thing in this helmet.
- this is not gonna work.
- why didn't you say so before?
i did say so before.
where are you taking this... thing?
prisoner transfer from cell block 1138.
i wasn't notified.
i'll have to clear it.
- look out! he's loose!
- he'll tear us all apart!
look out.
we gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.
here it is... 2187. you go and get her.
i'll hold them here.
everything's under control.
situation normal.
what happened?
had a slight weapons malfunction...
but everything's perfectly all right now.
we're fine. we're all fine here now.
thank you.
- how are you?
- we're sending a squad up.
negative, negative.
we have a reactor leak here now.
give us a few minutes to lock it down.
large leak, very dangerous.
who is this? what's your operating number?
boring conversation anyway.
luke, we're gonna have company!
aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?
oh, the uniform.
i'm luke skywalker.
i'm here to rescue you.
- you're who?
- i'm here to rescue you. i've got your r2 unit.
- i'm here with ben kenobi.
- ben kenobi? where is he?
come on.
- he is here.
- obi-wan kenobi?
- what makes you think so?
- a tremor in the force.
the last time i felt it
was in the presence of my old master.
surely he must be dead by now.
don't underestimate the force.
the jedi are extinct.
their fire has gone out of the universe.
you, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.
yes.
we have an emergency alert
in detention block aa-23.
the princess? put all sections on alert.
obi-wan is here. the force is with him.
if you're right,
he must not be allowed to escape.
escape is not his plan.
i must face him alone.
get behind me. get behind me.
watch your left.
they went down the cell bay.
- can't get out that way.
- you cut off our only escape route.
maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
your highness.
- c-3po. c-3po.
- yes, sir?
are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? we've been cut off.
what was that? i didn't copy.
i said all systems have been
alerted to your presence, sir.
the main entrance
seems to be the only way in or out.
all other information on your level
is restricted.
open up in there. open up in there.
oh, no.
there isn't any other way out.
i can't hold them off forever. now what?
this is some rescue. when you came in here,
didn't you have a plan for getting out?
he's the brains, sweetheart.
well, i didn't...
- what the hell are you doing?
- somebody has to save our skins.
into the garbage chute, flyboy.
get in there!
get in there, you big furry oaf.
i don't care what you smell.
get in there, and don't worry about it.
wonderful girl.
either i'm gonna kill her,
or i'm beginning to like her.
get in there.
the garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.
what an incredible smell
you've discovered.
let's get out of here.
- get away from there.
- no, wait.
forget it! i already tried it!
it's magnetically sealed.
put that thing away!
you're gonna get us all killed!
absolutely, your worship.
look, i had everything under control
till you led us down here.
it's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us.
it could be worse.
it's worse.
- there's something alive in here.
- that's your imagination.
something just moved past my leg.
- look. did you see that?
- what?
kid! luke!
grab hold of this!
blast it! my gun's jammed.
- where?
- anywhere!
help him!
- what happened?
- i don't know.
it just let go of me and disappeared.
i got a bad feeling about this.
- the walls are moving!
- try and brace it with something.
help me.
wait a minute.
where could he be?
take over. see to him.
look, there.
they're madmen.
they're heading for the prison level.
if you hurry, you might catch them.
follow me.
you stand guard.
come on.
all this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.
if you don't mind, i'd like to
take him down to maintenance.
all right.
- get on top.
- i can't.
where could he be? 3po.
they aren't here.
something must have happened to them.
see if they've been captured. hurry.
one thing's for sure.
we're all gonna be a lot thinner.
- get on top of it.
- i'm trying.
thank goodness they haven't found them.
where could they be?
"use the comlink"? oh, my.
i forgot. i turned it off.
- are you there, sir?
- 3po?
- we've had some problems.
- shut up and listen to me.
shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. do you copy?
shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!
shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!
no, shut them all down. hurry! oh, no.
what?
you did great, 3po!
listen to them. they're dying, r2.
curse my metal body. i wasn't fast enough.
it's all my fault. my poor master.
we're all right. you did great!
hey! open the pressure maintenance hatch
on unit number... where are we?
if we can avoid any more female advice,
we oughta be able to get out of here.
let's get moving.
where you goin'?
wait! they'll hear!
come here, you big coward.
- chewie, come here.
- listen.
i don't know who you are
or where you came from...
but from now on,
you do as i tell you, okay?
look, your worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.
i take orders from just one person... me.
it's a wonder you're still alive.
will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?
no reward is worth this.
give me regular reports, please.
right.
- do you know what's going on?
- maybe it's another drill.
you seen that new vt-16?
yeah. some of the other guys
were telling me about it.
they say it's quite a thing to see.
what was that?
it's nothing. outgassing.
don't worry about it.
- there she is.
- c-3po, do you copy?
yes, sir.
- are you safe?
- for the moment.
we're in the main hangar
across from the ship.
we're right above you. stand by.
you came in that thing?
you're braver than i thought.
nice. come on.
it's them. blast them.
get back to the ship!
- where are you going?
- he certainly has courage.
what good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? come on.
i think we took a wrong turn.
there's no lock.
- that oughta hold them for a while.
- quick. we've got to get across.
- find the controls to extend the bridge.
- i think i just blasted it.
they're coming through.
here, hold this.
here they come.
for luck.
we think they may be splitting up.
they may be on level 5 and 6 now, sir.
where could they be?
close the blast doors.
open the blast doors.
open the blast doors.
i've been waiting for you, obi-wan.
we meet again at last.
the circle is now complete.
when i left you, i was but the learner.
now i am the master.
only a master of evil, darth.
your powers are weak, old man.
you can't win, darth.
if you strike me down...
i shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.
you should not have come back.
didn't we just leave this party?
- what kept you?
- we ran into some old friends.
- the ship all right?
- seems okay, if we can get to it.
i hope the old man got
the tractor beam down.
look.
come on, r2. we're going.
now's our chance. go!
come on!
come on!
- luke, it's too late!
- blast the door, kid!
run, luke, run.
i hope that old man got the tractor beam down,
or this is gonna be a short trip. hit it!
we're coming up on their sentry ships.
hold them off. angle the deflector
shields while i charge up the main guns.
i can't believe he's gone.
there wasn't anything you could have done.
come on, buddy. we're not out of this yet.
you in, kid? okay, stay sharp.
here they come.
they're coming in too fast!
- we've lost the lateral controls.
- don't worry. she'll hold together.
hear me, baby? hold together.
got him. i got him!
great, kid. don't get cocky.
there's still two more.
- that's it. we did it.
- we did it.
help. i think i'm melting.
this is all your fault.
are they away?
they've just made the jump
into hyperspace.
you're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?
i'm taking an awful risk, vader.
this had better work.
not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
you know, sometimes i amaze even myself.
that doesn't sound too hard.
they let us go. it's the only
explanation for the ease of our escape.
- you call that easy?
- they're tracking us.
not this ship, sister.
at least the information in r2
is still intact.
what's so important? what's he carrying?
the technical readouts
of that battle station.
i only hope that when the data's
analyzed a weakness can be found.
- it's not over yet.
- it is for me, sister.
i ain't in this for your revolution,
and i'm not in it for you, princess.
i expect to be well paid.
i'm in it for the money.
you needn't worry about your reward.
if money is all that you love,
then that's what you'll receive.
your friend is quite a mercenary.
i wonder if he really cares
about anything... or anybody.
i care.
so...
what do you think of her, han?
i'm trying not to, kid.
good.
still, she's got a lot of spirit.
what do you think?
you think a princess and a guy like me...
no.
you're safe. when we heard about
alderaan, we feared the worst.
we have no time for sorrows, commander.
you must use the information
in this r2 unit to help plan the attack.
it's our only hope.
- yes.
- we're approaching the planet yavin.
the rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.
we are preparing to orbit the planet.
the battle station is heavily shielded...
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet.
its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.
a small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.
pardon me for asking, sir, but what good
are snub fighters against that?
the empire doesn't consider a small,
one-man fighter to be any threat...
or they'd have a tighter defense.
an analysis of the plans
provided by princess leia...
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.
the approach will not be easy.
you're required to maneuver
straight down this trench...
and skim the surface to this point.
the target area is only two meters wide.
it's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.
the shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.
a precise hit
will start a chain reaction...
which should destroy the station.
only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.
the shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
that's impossible, even for a computer.
no, it's not. i used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my t-16 back home.
they're not much bigger than two meters.
then man your ships,
and may the force be with you.
orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.
the moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.
this will be a day long remembered.
it has seen the end of kenobi...
and will soon see
the end of the rebellion.
all flight crews, man your stations.
so, you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?
that's right. yeah.
i got some old debts
i gotta pay off with this stuff.
even if i didn't, you don't think i'd be
fool enough to stick around here, do ya?
why don't you come with us?
you're pretty good in a fight. we could use ya.
come on. why don't you take a look around?
you know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.
they could use a good pilot like you.
you're turning your back on them.
what good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?
besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.
it's more like... suicide.
all right.
well, take care of yourself, han.
i guess that's what you're best at,
isn't it?
hey, luke.
may the force be with you.
what are you looking at?
i know what i'm doing.
all pilots to your stations.
- what's wrong?
- it's han.
i don't know.
i really thought he'd change his mind.
he's got to follow his own path.
no one can choose it for him.
i only wish ben were here.
open main launch tubes.
main launch tubes opening, sir.
hey, luke!
- biggs!
- i don't believe it. how are ya?
- coming up?
- i'll be up there with you.
- have i got stories to tell you.
- skywalker.
are you sure you can handle this ship?
sir, luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.
- you'll do all right.
- thank you, sir. i'll try.
gotta get aboard. we'll hear all your
stories when we get back, all right?
hey, biggs.
i told you i'd make it someday.
it'll be like old times, luke.
they'll never stop us.
this r2 unit of yours seems
a bit beat up. you want a new one?
not on your life. that droid and i
have been through a lot.
you okay, r2?
good.
gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure.
hang on tight, r2.
you've got to come back.
you wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?
luke, the force will be with you.
standby alert. death star approaching.
estimated time to firing range,
- all wings report in.
- red 10 standing by.
- red seven standing by.
- red three standing by.
- red six standing by.
- red nine standing by.
- red two standing by.
- red 11 standing by.
red five standing by.
lock s-foils in attack position.
we're passing through the magnetic field.
hold tight. switch your deflectors on.
double front.
look at the size of that thing.
cut the chatter, red two.
accelerate to attack speed.
- this is it, boys.
- red leader, this is gold leader.
- i copy, gold leader.
- we're starting for the target shaft.
we're in position. i'm going to cut
across the axis and draw their fire.
- heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.
- i see it. stay low.
this is red five. i'm going in.
luke, pull up!
- you all right?
- a little cooked, but i'm okay.
we count 30 rebel ships, but they're so
small they're evading our turbolasers.
we'll have to destroy them ship to ship.
get the crews to their fighters.
watch yourself. there's a lot of fire coming
from the right side of that deflection tower.
i'm on it.
- i'm going in. cover me, porkins.
- right with you, red three.
i've got a problem here.
- eject.
- i can hold it.
- pull up!
- no, i'm all right...
the rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.

i think you overestimate their chances.

red boys, this is red leader.
rendezvous at mark 6. 1.
- this is red two flying toward you.
- red three standing by.
red leader, this is base one.

my signal to start your run.
this is it.

my starboard engine.

rebel base, one minute and closing.
biggs, wedge, let's close it up.
we're going in full throttle. that ought
to keep those fighters off our back.
right with you, boss.
at that speed,
will you be able to pull out in time?
it'll be just like
beggars canyon back home.
we'll stay back far enough to cover you.
my scope shows the tower,
but l can't see the exhaust port.
are you sure the computer can hit it?
watch yourself.
increase speed, full throttle.
what about that tower?
you worry about those fighters.
i'll worry about the tower.
r2, that stabilizer's broken loose
again. see if you can't lock it down.
fighters coming in .3.
- i'm hit. i can't stay with you.
- get clear, wedge.
- you can't do any more good back there.

r2, try and increase the power.
hurry up, luke. quick.
quick.
