- b.p. is spiking.
- oh, god, i'm in pain!
- when did it start?
- last night.
is your wife due soon?
- not for another 5 weeks.
- i'm fine,
- i'm getting better. i'm getting better.
- what's the b.p.?
still high.
we can fix it, don't worry.
nolan... nolan...
what?
tell me something, please.
tell me anything.
you're gonna be okay.
alright?
i want you to lay back down.
- okay.
- lay back down and breathe.
just breathe.
wait here.
oh, my baby!
...do think a strong category 4 or a 5...
so certainly devastating...
deaths which occurred at the cone,
which you'll see in a moment.
the cone will cross
right through new orleans,
but as of 5 am central time
just, look at this storm.
i mean, meteorologically speaking it
really is a perfect hurricane
with high cloud tops high and visible.
oh, my god.
everyone move to the lobby upstairs!
o.r. lobby! o.r. lobby!
take the stairs! second floor.
let's go. let's go!
sir? i need you to go upstairs.
the doctor told me to wait here.
i understand, but the doctors will know
where to find you. okay?
just before dawn katrina heads
north west straight for the coast.
down a hair from its 175 miles
per hour peak,
and new orleans buckles in
for a bumpy ride...
manuel diego!
is there a manuel diego here?
mister hayes?
walk with me.
so, how is she?
it is a she. did you know that?
what? know what?
you have a baby girl.
a girl?
let me show you
where we're keeping her
but do know that we'll need to monitor her
for the next few days.
the nicu is, is overcrowded
so i've got her in a private room.
okay. so, how's abigail doing?
we transfused all that we had.
i want you to know that.
doctor mendolson
and i we did all we could, but...
her liver had given up.
she bled out.
i'm sorry.
okay. okay, so...?
mister hayes.
i'm really sorry.
she expired at seven this morning.
not abby.
no.
- i'm sorry.
- not my abby. she's fine. tell me she's fine.
tell me she's fine.
i swear to god you better tell me
she's fine right now.
just tell me she's okay. let's just,
let's go see her. she's okay, right?
mister hayes, let...
don't touch me, though.
i want you to tell me.
just tell me she's okay.
- i'm sorry, mister hayes.
- no, not sorry. i don't want sorry. i want...
mister haynes,
let me take you to see your daughter.
yeah.
here at the end.
there she is.
what is this?
this is a ventilator.
your daughter hasn't yet learned
how to breathe on her own, so...
this is giving her a little help.
now we got an i.v. drip
to feed her nutrients and...
she'll be big and healthy
before you know.
you have any questions?
how's abigail?
- i'm gonna give you something, it'll help you.
- no. listen to me.
i'm okay.
it was just a stupid question.
it's okay. it's alright.
i'm gonna have a nurse check on you.
how long will this baby
need the machine?
your daughter?
the best guess is... 48 hours.
but it's still too early to tell.
you'll know you're out of danger is
when she starts crying.
the first time she does
it's always a good sound.
- i'll be back.
- alright. and, doctor edmonds...
with this storm are you gonna be
moving people out?
it's a hurricane.
look, people are gonna tell you it's better
at charity, or lindy boggs.
it won't be. stay with your daughter,
mister hayes. okay?
i don't know you.
i'm panicky. it's just going bad for me. i
see a gun and i see this guy going for it,
so i start wrestling with him
the best that i can.
mind you? this is all happening
in the middle of the day,
right outside of the bank,
in the parking lot. sorry.
- that's when i rob all my banks.
- hush.
so the driver gets out of the car
and he comes running over.
meanwhile i'm playing keep-away
with the guy for the gun,
- but the driver doesn't go for the gun.
- he goes for the money.
the duffel bag.
so he grabs the duffel bag,
the driver, and he runs back to the car.
- mean while mr. pantyhose face is screaming...
- he was, like, "larry! larry don't you dare!"
yeah. so, larry, the getaway driver,
hightails it out of there.
he's peeling out, he's just about to the street
when this little car comes out of nowhere...
- my car is not that little.
- it's a little car.
it got the job done, didn't it?
- you wanna tell the story or should i finish?
- anyway, i get out, i run over,
and i mace him
as he's getting out of his car.
yeah, it was hairspray.
- there's no mace about it. that was hairspray.
- i blinded him and he couldn't run.
i did my job. and the police got there
shortly afterwards and...
- we saved the day... yeah.
- yeah.
- that's how we met.
- yeah.
oh my god you two.
- you're like an old married couple.
- i worry about your kids.
- oh, we're not having kids.
- no, we're not married.
abby.
i don't want the baby now.
i want you back.
i want you.
please...
sir?
you can't be back here.
she's my wife.
she's my wife
i'm sorry.
but this area is off limits.
well, she shouldn't be
on the floor like this.
we're running short on staff today,
there's a backlog.
well, whatever, let's get a body bag or
something, we'll put her in a body bag...
there really isn't anywhere else
for her to go.
it will only take a minute. let's just
get her on some higher ground please.
come on, get her feet.
okay.
thank you.
i mean that.
it's okay.
i'm sorry for your loss.
how did she die?
giving birth to our daughter.
well, at least you have a child.
that's good news.
thousands of others sound sleep
when the noise started.
it was katrina hammering away
at the roof, trying to get in.
you have one saved message.
hey love. i know i said i was okay
but my heart is racing and, okay,
so, should we chance that out to the hospital,
or do we try to get out of town, because i,
i don't know if it's just nerves
or something serious.
you decide. i trust you.
to replay this message, press...
hey love. i know i said i was okay
but my heart is racing and, okay,
so, should we chance that out to the hospital,
or do we try to get out of town, because i,
i don't know if this is just nerves
or something ser...
- mister hayes?
- uh, yeah.
hi. i'm shelly.
hi. nolan.
this is my turf, so if you need anything,
you let me know.
- okay.
- okay? and i've got something for you.
it's your daughter's birth certificate.
you have a name for her?
no. we talked about it.
i liked haley.
but my wife liked anything but haley.
yeah.
well, katrina seems to be
a popular name right now.
you know,
ah... abby's favorite place...
my wife, she...
she really liked this tree,
it was in a park by our house...
a few years ago,
it was struck by lightning.
we'd have picnics there.
she always said it was a safe haven.
because of that old saying that...
- lightning never strikes twice in the same place...
- yeah. right.
do you think that's real?
about lightning?
well, yeah, i suppose so.
well, maybe is not just lightening.
- what happens if the power goes out?
- the generators will kick in. we'll be okay.
this place has weathered storms before. and
most of our equipment has battery backup.
alright.
it's gonna be okay.
thank you.
you're welcome.
you heard her.
everything's gonna be okay.
- hey, what's going on?
- come on, we gotta go.
- this way people!
- alright, everyone stay together.
- hey, what's going on?
- evacuating. we got three drivers. come on.
everyone to the rear entrance.
- hey, doctor edmonds?
- mister hayes.
- i thought you said it was bad everywhere.
- this is not my call.
calm and orderly, please!
is there something wrong
with the hospital?
we're overcrowded and understaffed.
the administration just got nervous,
that's all. it's just a partial evacuation.
okay. then what are you gonna do
with my daughter?
that ventilator isn't portable.
if they order a full evacuation, we'll
get you a private ride to charity. okay?
- so, you come back then?
- no, i'm not leaving.
if there's something i can do,
just let me know.
sure.
stop the storm.
let's move!
hey! you missed the party, man.
yeah, it looks like it.
you going to charity?
what?
charity hospital, man.
people are leaving.
no. i have to stay here.
you know we're closing the cafeteria
in a few minutes.
do you think you can get me some food?
no, man.
the nurses took what was left. sorry.
you think maybe
you can get some coins?
the ones on the first floor,
they're gonna be picked over,
but if you take the stairs up to four,
there's gonna be a little waiting
area outside surgery.
okay. thank you.
they're sending me out on the next bus.
tulane they got food, but no cooks.
- alright. well, good luck.
- you too.
wait.
some luncheon meat.
no bread, but salami, some turkey...
take it, man.
- nah. no. i can't take your food.
- i don't need it like you do.
i was about to get mad.
- i appreciate it.
- don't eat that all at once, though.
yeah, finally some good news.
a levy that has broken on lake
pontchartrain from new orleans.
this is new video that we have just gotten
in, we're seeing it for the first time.
nothing to stop this water
from just pouring in right now...
hey!
hey!
what the hell is that?
what's that?
no, no, no, no!
yes... okay.
no.
no, don't do this to me.
stupid machine.
no.
no. hey! hey,
we got a bad battery in here!
hey, is anybody on this floor?
nurse?
i need a battery.
battery. battery.
alright, hold on.
alright.
i hear you'!
i hear you'!
come on, you, stupid battery!
won't hold a charge.
hey! can somebody
get their ass in here, please?!
i could really use some help!
hey, is anybody here?!
oh, my god!
the first floor's flooding.
hey, we're in 204.
room 204, please!
somebody please!
nolan?
shelly.
the levees broke.
the streets are flooding.
the back entrance is still okay.
you can go out that way.
no, wait. we gotta get her out of here then.
we gotta get out the whole thing.
the battery's old and it's only taking a small charge.
if you look at it, it's only good for 3 minutes.
move her where?
we could roll it out.
put it on the bus and get it out.
there's no buses.
we can go up a couple of floors, go to the roof
top and wait for a helicopter to come and...
no. the power is out and we can't get that
thing up the stairs by ourselves.
we'll have to wait 'til the power comes
back on and then we'll get you a medevac.
- what, so we're stranded here?
- just until power comes back.
where's doctor edmonds at?
he left an hour ago.
- what?
- he went with some of the icu patients.
he was going to come back with the bus
drivers, but then the levees broke and...
shit!
pump!
okay, well, i'm not leaving!
shelly listen, i'm not leaving,
so, think about it.
what else could we do?
come here. what else can we do?
okay.
what?
i'll go get help.
okay? just hang in there.
yeah. well, okay. go.
- okay?
- yes. please, go. you're right.
go, please, but, hurry, shelly.
come on, alright? hurry!
i'm told that the new orleans police put out
a call to all of its officers saying...
if you have a boat bring it here, help us.
but the officers who have boats
cannot get to them in many cases,
because the roads are floaded
to their homes.
i don't think you want some, huh?
you don't. it's not good for babies.
that's the good stuff.
that's what's good for you.
you like it, don't you?
no.
i'm not going crazy,
i just feel like talking.
your mother,
she had a hard time sleeping at night.
but in the day time,
she was this real force of nature,
she just...
she ran her own business, and...
she carried herself like
a drill sergeant, you know.
she...
she was bulletproof.
that's what she was.
but at night she had these...
she'd have these stress dreams and...
i'd lay there in bed and...
i would, i would just say anything really,
i'd tell her how much i loved her,
and i would tell her how
everything was going to be okay.
and...
you know, most of the times,
she'd sleep the entire night through.
you would have really loved her.
let's see what else we got.
baby blanket?
latex gloves. what are these?
diapers.
i didn't even think about that.
you probably need your diaper changed.
we got daddy diaper directions.
we don't need you.
go away.
little diapers for a little baby.
why isn't that working?
oh, yeah. yeah, this is bad.
god! what has your mom
been feeding you? charcoal?
alright.
let's get this one out of there.
okay. where am i putting this?
let's get a couple of pieces going.
how does that feel?
does it feel alright?
someone please get the next one.
'cause i am tapped out.
did they give you one of these
reports to fill in?
no.
god! i hate paperwork.
i'm nolan, by the way.
abigail.
- pleasure to meet you.
- nice to meet you.
i got suckered. i thought they were gonna
deputize me or something. what a gyp.
yeah, i don't think it works like that.
well it should.
i totally stopped that getaway driver.
- you saw that, right?
- no, no, i saw that.
- that was really good work.
- yeah.
- yeah. you've done that before.
- yeah, clearly.
maybe you can get a reward too.
for walking into the other guy.
- oh, you mean the guy with the gun.
- yeah, that one.
- that guy.
- that guy.
- yeah.
- yeah.
what if i don't wanna be deputized?
well then what are you asking for?
dinner.
that sounds lovely.
okay. alright, but i'm driving.
- oh, yeah?
- i just figure,
in case on the way we see a jaywalker and you, all
of a sudden, get this urge to run him over...
- yeah?
- yeah.
- really? ...you had to go there.
- yeah.
- yeah, we gotta avoid that stuff.
- you know what?
when i'm deputy tat's gonna be legal.
yeah, we had our first date that night and then,
what, a month later we moved in together.
everyone thought we were being crazy, but,
i don't know, it just felt right with her.
i don't know how else to say it.
it just felt right.
that's not even the best story.
when i proposed...
what?
what now?
shit!
no.
you're kidding.
you're kidding.
shit! alright, i'll be back.
okay.
shit!
yeah.
yeah. yeah.

okay.
okay. okay, okay, okay,
dammit wait! wait!
are you kidding me?
bingo! bingo!

i got the orange ones.
i got the orange ones!
hold on, baby.
okay,
alright. i can do this.
that's right.
yeah.
good.
i'm back.
everything's gonna be all right,
sweetheart.
yeah, everything's gonna be okay.
and those problems are likely
to linger, brian.
the water is a problem for,
throughout the metro area.
people are being told to boil it
and electricity is also the problem.
hardly anybody has it and isn't
likely to have it for up to a month.
this is your mom.
she was on a panel at a convention.
and... the convention
was on event planning,
it was really just an event
to discuss planning other events.
i keep this picture because...
she'd argue that she didn't look cute
when she was angry.
and she used to hate it
when i told her that.
yeah.
pretty cute, huh?
let me see what else we have.
i hear you.
okay, here we go.
this is when i proposed to your mom.
let me preface by saying that
before i started dating your mother...
she hated the idea of marriage.
she said it was
"the death of the individual."
yeah. so she plans this romantic
getaway to this beach.
it was really a business write-off
because the hotel was trying
to get her to host events there.
and... i don't know, i just thought it'd be
a perfect time to pop the question, so...
i had my grandmother's ring restored.
they gave these to me
before your mother went into labor.
you know.
well, we went to dinner that night.
and it was this...
it was a fancy restaurant
at the end of this pier.
it was perfect, really, so,
you know, the drink order came and...
i dropped to one knee,
pulled the ring out...
she got mad.
she got so mad at me,
her nostrils flaring, all-the-way mad.
i didn't know what was going on.
she gets up and she throws
her napkin down on the table.
i thought i was gonna shatter
into a million pieces.
that's why i asked her.
"what's wrong?"
and she pulled out this ring.
she said,
"you, idiot, i was gonna propose to you!"
that's when this roving photographer
snapped this photo of us.
what else do i have?
you know that's somebody
i would have liked you to met.
you two are quite alike, really.
this here? this is your life.
this is you at 3 months.
kinda look like you're laying in a hammock.
you think?
let's see what we got.
oh, this is when you had us really worried.
you were trying to get all your nutrients
from your mom.
you were doing the best you could,
but, we didn't know.
this was a month later.
you see that?
your mom was on this crazy diet,
she was taking vitamins and supplements,
everything that she could to keep you
healthy and you just kept hanging on.
you're a fighter.
that's what the doctors kept saying.
kinda like your granddad.
all action and no words.
now you got me.
time for me to do the heavy lifting.
i gotta put in my hours.
and i'm on the clock.
there's been some huge health concerns
with poisonous snakes out there, fire ants
and mosquitos infecting the city.
have you heard much
about how concerned health officials
are about those folks whom...
weren't fortunate to get out.
when you start working again,
i'll hear you.

you're so stubborn.
i love that about you.

this. why this?
this wasn't supposed to happen.
i know.
but sometimes you
just have to hold onto whatever you can.
i won't be a good father.
not like i was a husband.
yes, you will.
do you remember marc's birthday party?
yeah.
we were all loitering
in the parking lot, and...
the plan was to go
to the dive bar next door,
keep the party going.
but you said that we couldn't make it
because i had to work the next day
and you had to get me to bed.
- yeah, and you were pissed.
- oh, yeah.
but secretly...
i loved that.
because i knew right then and there,
you'd be an amazing father.
but, i need you. you know?
i don't wanna do this without you.
you have me.
you always will.
she is you and me together.
you're not alone, nolan.
abigail.
she's listening.
she recognizes your voice.
abigail...
i'm so tired.
i'm just tired.
if they don't have a radio
they're not exactly sure what's going on.
we actually had one gentleman giving
us some sort of morse code...
with his flashlight this morning
in the early darkness,
trying to signal to us...
sixteen...
seventeen...
yeah, i'm coming.
yeah.
yeah, and soon you're gonna be
breathing on your own.

so that should be pretty soon.

okay?
and then we'll go home.
oh, yeah.

just one dude guarding it.

another one of you guys.
okay, if i just take one...
