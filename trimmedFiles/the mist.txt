all the food's gonna go bad
yeah, i drew up a list
i'll hit the store
before it gets all bought out
fuck
- can you save it?
- no. no way
no, i gotta start over from scratch
i'll call the studio
when the phones get back up,
see if they can extend my deadline
what choice do they have?
you kiddin'?
they could whip up some bad
photoshop poster in an afternoon
they do it all the time
two big heads
i should have brought it downstairs
with me last night
just stupid, i guess
well, sweetie,
you couldn't exactly know
that a tree was gonna come flying
through the window
yeah, i'll hit the hardware store too,
get some plastic sheeting
and duct tape
and seal this up
before it gets dark, you know
order in some new glass
oh, you know what?
that was your...
that was your grandfather's tree,
the one he planted
used to play in that tree
it's just stuff, though
you know, we're safe
that's all that counts
yeah
mom, dad, you gotta come see!
hey, billy, take it easy,
all right?
i really don’t want you running
all over the place
but you gotta come look
the boathouse is all bashed!
holy crap!
billy
sorry, mom, but you just
gotta come! come on!
come on
having spoken,
the doomsayer departs

to make me laugh?
you have incredibly low standards
let's go, uh, see the damage
no
- norton's tree
- yeah
you mean the dead one
i've been asking him
to take down for three years
before it finally blew over?
that tree?
- really got smooshed
- you ain't kiddin'
look at that
what is it, daddy?
mist
- on the lake?
- we've had mist on the lake before
coming off the mountain like that?
two fronts meeting,
left over from the storm,
something like that
you sure?
honey, i'm not the weatherman
why don't you take billy,
get him dressed
i'll take him to town with me
okay where you going?
i'm gonna go have a little chat
with our neighbour about his tree
hon
don’t worry, i'm not gonna
punch him in the nose
you know what he's gonna say
he's gonna say, "sue me,"
which, i don't know, maybe we should
honey, one property dispute
with this guy
is enough to last me a lifetime
i'm gonna ask
for his insurance information
okay
- that's all
- yeah
ohh!
mother fucker!
aw, shit!
ohh, you mother fucker!
cock sucker!
"turn on
"full choke
pull five choke"
i guess you’ve seen the...
boathouse
yeah, and...?
nothin'
just think we should trade
insurance info, you know?
that's all
oh, my insurance guy's
gonna love me
oh
shit the 1980
i was gonna bring
the station wagon, but
i don't know, the weather was
so beautiful coming out of new york,
i just...
you know, top down
i'm sorry, man i mean it
sincerely
- that's nice of you to say
- no, that car was cherry
i hate to see it like that
okay, i'll tell you what,
i'll find my insurance guy's number,
i'll bring it by later
- that okay?
- no problem
so, uh, david...
you’re not heading into town today
by any chance, are you?
well, cmp's out in force
maybe we'll get our power back
i know some storm, huh?
one for the books, yeah
for a moment there last night,
i thought we were gonna take off
and head for oz
wzon is off the air,
but portland's still broadcasting
daddy, look
ah
guys from the base
- from up the mountain?
- uh-huh
the arrowhead project?
well, you’re a local
any idea what they do up there?
missile defence research
you know, i'm sure
you’ve heard the stories
oh, sure
the woman at the laundromat
say that, uh,
they have a crashed flying saucer
up there with frozen alien bodies
right miss edna yeah
miss tabloid
"i had bigfoot's baby"
"satan's face appears
in oil well fire"
you know, real reliable stuff
well, they're in a hurry
maybe their power's out too
huh still no signal
why don't you go ahead?
i'm gonna try steph on a pay phone
can i go with mr norton, daddy?
sure, if you promise
to hold his hand, i guess
yeah
- yeah
here's a list
- sure
- okay?
meet you guys in there
hold hands
i'm sorry i didn't know
it was your sister
that looks so freaky!
hmm
- sally, hey
- hey, mr drayton on
you guys look jammed up
yeah, well, half the staff
didn't show, plus the power's out
oh, no what,
no backup generator?
only to keep the food cold
everything else,
welcome to the dark ages,
and bring your check book
hey, thursday night,
steph and i want a date night
- baby-sit?
- heck, yeah i'm there
oh, my god
the storm
every body's stockin' up
been like this since we opened
crappy day, huh?
eh, every one's a little
pissed off this morning
'morning, mrs carmody
with lines like these,
i don't know how good it is,
but i guess we'll have to make do
- keep your head down, pal
- i know it
hey, champ
your wife should be a doctor
she could make a fortune
in manhattan with this handwriting
yeah, it takes some getting used to
why don't you get your stuff?
i'll meet you at the checkout
okay, done
hey, david,
thanks for helping me out today
are you and mr norton
gonna be friends now, daddy?
oh, i don't know
"friends" might be
stretching it a little
i guess you’re not mad
at each other any more
i guess not
and that's a start, huh?
i'm sorry, ma'am,
the registers are down
the power outage got us too
hopefully we'll have
power up pretty soon
- the bus leaves in 30 minutes
- we'll make it, okay?
you guys get the goodies
i'll wait in line
i need some change
on register five
good morning, ms reppler
hello, ms reppler
well, hello to you, billy drayton on
how'd you hold up in the storm?
we had a tree come through
the picture window last night,
right in my studio
and the boathouse got all smooshed
mr norton's tree fell on it
ouch
- yeah
sorry to hear that
how'd you guys make out?
oh, we're fine
it's the listings i'm worried about
at the very least, i'll bet every one
of our "for sale" signs fell over
we had damage
at the school, wouldn't you know?
that's what we get for not fixing
that roof when we should've,
but with funds being cut every year
you'd think educating children
would be more
of a priority in this country,
but you’d be wrong
government's got better things
to spend our money on,
like corporate handouts
and building bombs
daddy, is there a fire?
is mommy all right?
i'm sure she's fine
don’t worry, okay?
mind what you’re doing, sally
oh, come on,
we got 10 days' leave
check our papers
look, i told you,
all leaves are cancelled
i don't know why
i gotta go check the pharmacy out
three men meet me
back at the jeep in five minutes
that's an order
shit, man! another half an hour,
and we'd have been gone
oh, my god!
something in the mist!
something in the mist
took john lee!
dan, catch your breath
something in the mist took john lee
i could hear him screaming
shut the doors! shut the doors!
my god!
daddy, i'm scared
can we go home?
don't go out there
there's something in the mist
it took john lee
screw that!
i'm gettin' in my car
mister, no!
please hold me
it's okay, it's okay
it's a pollution cloud
the mills down in rumford
some kind of chemical explosion
has to be
what is it?
what's going on?
it's death
stay down!
daddy!
you okay?
that was an earthquake
i tell you, the goddamn mills blew up!
is every one okay?
is any one hurt?
every body just stay put, okay?
just stay inside the store
i can't i can't stay here
i gotta get home to my kids
no
no, don't go out there
it's death out there
it's the end of days
stop it, okay? stop it
please, every body,
every body just relax, okay?
he's right let's just stay cool
let's just try to figure out
what happened
i'm sorry, i... i can’t just stay here
i have to get home to my kids
ma'am, no, you can't go out there
could be a poisonous gas cloud
didn't you hear that man screaming?
i agree let's stay here
until we figure it out
you're not listening!
i can't stay here
wanda's looking after little victor
she's only 8
sometimes she forgets
she's supposed to be watching him
i told them i'd only be gone
a few minutes
she's only 8
for their sakes,
don't
well, isn't anybody gonna help me?
shh it's okay, pal
won't somebody here
see a lady home?
you?
you?
it's okay, buddy
- you?
ma'am, please,
i got my own boy to worry about
i hope you all rot in hell
ma'am, please, wait until...
okay,
let's start cleaning up, okay?
get the spilled bottles,
broken glass, stuff like that
aisle three has medical supplies
it's okay it's okay
all right, easy, champ
come on
come on
come on
all right, hey, hey, hey
can't keep crying like this, pal
come on!
come on,
you’re gonna hurt yourself
- come on, are you all right?
- i want mommy!
all right, i know you want mommy
all right, just try to breathe
just try to breathe, okay?
just try to breathe, pal
that's okay
it's all right
i haven't seen him suck his thumb
like this since he was 2 years old
he's in shock
i think we all are
you haven't met
amanda dunfrey
she's new in town
as of this semester
teaches third grade
and the specialed kids,
now that mosher's retired
she's wonderful
the kids love her
and david's an artist
he does movie posters and such
and me
lord, i'm babbling away
like some old biddy at a tea party!
my nerves are jangled, i guess
boy settle down?
how is he?
still hot
why don't i get him some aspirin
- aisle three
- okay
thanks
how's dan?
his nose stopped bleedin'
he's calmer now
somebody gave him a valium
can't believe the way he ran in here
never seen him like that
i need something to cover my boy up
got any blankets?
furniture pads loadin' dock
gonna keep checkin' on people
if you need anything, just holler
you bet sally, you mind?
oh, i'd love to. i really should
help him clean up
- i'll take him
- okay
daddy, don't go
no, i'll be gone two seconds, big bill
come on, i'm gonna get your blanket
mrs reppler's here,
and so is mrs turman
i'll be close by, okay?
- okay
- don’t worry, i'm not far okay?
let me look at you
hmm?
wanna lie down?
yeah
there you go
soon as it blows away,
we can walk out of here safe andfree,
but we have to be smart about it
first thing we need to do
is keep our wits about us
and find out what’s happened
well, how we gonna
do that, my man?
we've got no phone signal,
got no radio
i'm sure they're working
on those problems as we speak
it stands to reason
that restoring communications
would be their top priority
jeez!
oh, shit.
ow!
shit!
god damn it!
ow! ow!
bitch!
it's obvious that we’re...
we're in some kind
of natural disaster here
ain't nothin' obvious
about this sombitch from where i sit
there ain't nothin'
natural about it either
that's right
it's judgment day,
and it's come round at last
there is nothing more obvious
or natural than that
ohh, fuck, now
you've done that to yourself,
by a life of sin and dissolution
hey, whoa! david!
hey, you guys hear that?
the generator?
we're just gonna check it out
no, no, i turned the generator off
it... it was backing up
- n-nobody else heard that sound?
- what sound?
i don't know, like a weird noise,
back there in the dark
like something was, like,
pressing against the door
did you hear it
before the lights went out, or after?
no, only after
after, but, look, i heard it, okay?
- nobody's calling you a liar
- that's what it sounds like
no, no, no, no
now, don't be that away, mr drayton on
you had a scare, no doubt
what say we all go check it out?
here
oooopf!
man.
it's pretty rank in here
- myron, go check it out
- all right
go on, fire it up
all right!
shut it off!
holy crow, don't that stink!
something's
got the exhaust vent
plugged up from the outside
you get it running long enough
to raise that door a little,
i'll go out and clear
whatever's blockin' it
no, no, you can't do that
why not?
it's an electric door, right?
well, yeah, but it may not be wise
to send him out there
okay, i'll do it
no, look, it's not about
who goes out there
what, don't you think i can do it?
hey! i want to go!
it was my idea
well, wait, just stop, okay?
j-jim, right?
myron? you guys are...
you, well, you don't seem
to understand,
or you’re try in' real hard not to
this is no ordinary mist, okay?
you open that door,
and something gets in here
like what?
well, like whatever
made that noise i heard
are you guys being will fully dense?
mr drayton on, you’ll pardon me,
but i'm not convinced
that you heard anything
i mean, we're not
hearing anything now, right?
anybody?
see?
now, i know, i know...
you’re a big shot artist
with connections in new york
and hollywood and all like that,
but that don't make you better
than anybody else, not in my book
hey, i didn't say that
nor do i like being talked down to
or called stupid
by a guy who went to college,
just 'cause he's got the jitters
fellas, it doesn't even matter
about the generator
the food'll keep without it
kid, i'm gonna start the motor,
you raise the door,
and you yell out
when you got enough room
yeah okay, good
wait
this is...
you guys gonna let
this kid risk his life
over a generator
that doesn't even matter?
would you just
shut the fuck up already?
norm!
listen, mr drayton on,
i tell you what
the next time
you got somethin' to say,
you count your teeth,
because i'm sick to death
of your bullshit
all right?
come on, myron
this is crazy!
leave 'em be
what am i, impugning
their manhood or something?
listen, they've lost
their sense of proportion
what's going on here?
out there in the market,
they were scared and confused
in here, there's a problem
they can solve,
so they're goddamn gonna solve it
ready, kid?
- let's rock
norm, come on
don't, man
it's a mistake
pussy
go up!
so
any boogeymen?
pretty scary, ain't it, norm?
yeah, right
norm

oh, jesus!
shit! oh, shit!
oh, shit!
david, it's no good!
start the generator
hey, i'm sorry
i mean, how the...
how the hell was i supposed
to know what you meant?
you said you heard something
how was i supposed to know
what you meant?
you should've said
what you meant better
i don't know, i thought maybe
it was a big bird or something
you got that kid killed!
did you get a good look at it? huh?
did you get a good look
at what you did?
- huh?
- david!
don't hit him any more!
doesn't solve anything!
you two assholes,
you got that kid killed!
and i got his fuckin' blood on me!
okay, i'm done
okay
what's next?
kill the generator
that's the first thing
i'm sorry
jesus christ! oh, god!
i'm... i'm sorry about the kid
oh, god oh, god oh, god
we oughtta get out of here
hey, we didn't twist his arm
yeah, he's a fuckin' kid
he's supposed to be stupid
what's your excuse, huh?
get outta here
go back in the market
stay by the door
don't say anything, to anybody
not yet
not yet
shit
david? need a little light here
we have to tell 'em
the people in the market,
we have to stop 'em going outside
they won't believe us
they have to
i'm not sure i believe it
i was here.
w- what we saw was impossible
you know that, don't you?
i mean, what...
what do we say?
how do we convince them?
ollie, what the hell were
those tentacles even attached to?
oh, my god!
are... are you all right?
shh! yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's not my blood i'm fine
w- what the hell happened?
i'll explain give me a minute, okay?
i need to deal with something first
please, i've got to...
i can't let billy see me like this
he's scared enough
just give me a minute
keep him distracted okay?
okay
hey, look,
i'm sorry about norm
me too
i mean, i ain't makin' excuses,
i'm just sayin'
look, we need to tell people
no need to say how it went down
or anything like that,
but, uh, we're in the deep shit here
people need to know
what about the out-of-towners?
we got plenty of them in the store
where do we even start?
brent norton?
that windbag?
he's an important attorney
in new york
that fellow could be
on the bench one day
counts a lot with people of this town,
or... or any here
yeah, that's right
- do it quick, david
we've got to discuss how we’re gonna
stop that thing getting in here
w- wait what do you mean
getting in?
you shut the loading door
yeah, but the entire front of the store
is plate glass
jesus christ
i was wondering
where you’d gotten to
um, listen
that guy that came in here,
the one with the bloody nose
they're... they're...
we saw tentacles.
ain't goin' very well, is it?
unh-unh
- you what?
- come here, you’ve got...
come here
tell him
it's true
tentacles yeah
um, gentlemen, um
i'm sorry, i...
i'm just not that stupid
i mean, what do you take me for?
i'm shocked
i'm shocked
i'm shocked it's pretty tasteless
using what's happening here
to try to make me look like an idiot
no, no, that's not
what's going on here
look, come back
to the loading dock, okay?
i'll show you
blood a chunk of tentacle
on... on the floor
no
no? what do you mean no?
no we've got real problems
to deal with here,
and this pathetic attempt at a joke
has gone far enough
mr norton, what reason
could we possibly have...?
oh, please! please!
this is pay back for the lawsuit
that i filed against him last year,
and you guys are backing him up
so winning wasn't enough, huh?
you wanted to humiliate me
some more,
show me a rubber snake
while these... these hicks
stand around laughing their asses off
- watch who you callin' a hick!
- myron! myron!
- hey, hey, fuck...!
mr norton
i swear, you have
got us all wrong
you're not too crazy about,
um, out-of-towners, are you?
i only spend my money,
and i pay my taxes here,
and i have seen you
talking behind my back
y'all stick together
well, don't i feel foolish?
i actually thought you were
being kind to me today,
and, well, thanks
for setting me straight
and i'm glad that tree fell
on your boathouse, you know that?
glad smashed it in
pretty good, didn't it? fantastic
now, all of y'all,
just stay out of my way
i know you’re scared, man
i'm scared too
- lives are at stake around here
- david...
okay, my son's life
now, i need you.
brent, please,
get your head out of your ass
all right, i'll drag you
back there if i have to
come here
david, get your goddamn hands
off of me!
i'll sue your ass again!
sue your ass, and this time
you’ll go to jail!
this man assaulted me
he assaulted me
you were witness to it
this man's crazy
he's crazy
no
he isn't i wish he was, but he isn't
e- every one in the store,
you want to come back here?
there's something you need to hear
it concerns you all
okay
w- w-wait i don't know
what you people think you’re doing
you're drinking?
for christ's sake, ollie
do you want me to report you?
you want to lose your job?
look, i'm gonna be taking down
names, starting with you
and i am prepared to file
a police report
- fine, bud, write down your names
- i will
but in the meantime,
shut the fuck up and listen
this is mr david drayton on
you need to hear what he's got to say
if you’re thinking about leaving
go hang out
with the ladies, all right?
listen, don't be scared
it's okay
okay
this is how it is
now, i don't know
what this mist is
but there are things in it, and they're
dangerous, like dan said
that's right
that's exactly right
what kind of things?
i never saw it
it happened too fast
i got knocked down
five of us went back
in the loading dock
it was jim, myron, ollie
me
norm, the bagboy
- we opened the door
- where's norm?
so norm could go out
and clear the vent for the generator
something come out of the mist
and took him
took him?
what do you mean?
just killed him
i mean dragged him off
now, guys, i don't know
what these things are
all we saw were tentacles
tentacles?
tentacles, he say
tentacles from planet x
it's a lie, you know
i mean, all these people do
is just lie each other up
it's a pile of shit
of course it's a lie
of course it's a lie
it's lunacy
from the look of it, the tentacles
are coming out of the beer cans
all right, uh, bud,
don't take our word for it
go look
over there
what the hell is that?
it appears we may have a problem
of some magnitude here
yeah, just keep 'em in line
thanks
let me
help these people
let me...
let me preach your word
let me shine your light,
'cause they're not all bad
they can't all be bad
some can be saved, can't they?
yes
some can be brought
to heaven's holy gates
through your grace
i have to believe that,
though i know most will swim
in the lake of fire forever
if i can save a few
even one
then my life will have counted
for something
i will have pulled my weight
i will have earned my place
at your side
i will have served a purpose
here on this earth
hello?
what?
i just need to use the bathroom
oh
okay well, then, have at it
ma'am
i... i just want you to know
that it's okay...
being scared, i mean...
and, well, if you need a friend...
you know, someone to talk to
i have a friend...
god up above
i talk to him every day
don't you condescend to me
i'm sorry?
not ever
you don't mock me
that's not what i was doing
well, i'll tell you what...
the day i need a friend like you,
i'll just have my self a little squat
and shit one out
maybe you do believe this
maybe they're not lies,
they're delusions whatever
uh, the fact remains,
the evidence here is flimsy
- it's bordering on ludicrous
- hey, this isn't a courtroom
you're not arguing a case,
and you’re doing nothing but damage,
talking the way you are
and you can throw as much cow's blood
around the loading dock as you want to
you still haven't fooled any one
leave it alone, david
you can't convince
some people there's a fire
even when their hair is burning
denial is a powerful thing
well, keep talking
i'll have no part of it,
nor would any thinking person
keep thinking, mr lawyer
there's no defence
against the will of god
there's no court of appeals in hell
there's no defence here, either
not even with all the fertilizer
in the world,
not even if you stack it
as high as you can
it's still just bags of shit, isn't it?
those of you who want to discuss
this thing rationally
to find a means of rescue
are welcome to join me
those who want to stack dog food,
knock yourselves out
we got those windows taped up
as best we could
it should help
yeah, think so?
duct tape and dog food bags
that bad?
it's not good
there's none so blind
as those who will not see
open your eyes
let the scales fall away
this has all been written
revelations, chapter 15:
"and the temple was filled with smoke
"from the glory of god
"and from his power,
"and no one could enter the temple
until the seven plagues
of the seven angels were completed"
well, what are you saying?
what are you proposing?
that we all prepare
to meet our maker
oh, prepare to meet shit!
lady, your tongue
must be hung in the middle
so that it can waggle at both ends
the end time has come,
not in flames, but in mist
come here!
easy! back off!
how about if your ass prepares
to meet my size-10 work boot
how about that?
hey, there's no call for that
myron, please,
calm your friend down
i'm trying
to save your soul, you stupid man
- doubters will doubt till the end
- it's okay
no, i'm sorry, i'm sorry
a monstrosity did pull
that poor boy away
things in the mist...
do you doubt?
do you?
then go out
go out and say,
"how do you do"
shut up, lady
for god's sakes
look, you’ll have to stop now
you're scaring the children
they should be scared
oh, yes, they should
their beautiful, pure little minds
have been corrupted with lies
lies
all this talk of a modern god,
or no god
there is one god
the god of the israelites
and he is a stern and vengeful god,
and we have been mocking him
far too long,
and now he demands
retribution in blood
it is time to declare yourselves
take sides...
the saved and the damned
read the good book
it calls for expiation
- blood!
- what?
blood
little normie was first,
and now god calls the rest of us
the bill is due
it must be paid
as abraham prepared
to sacrifice his only son
to prove his love for god, so...
enough
- ohh
- another down payment
a few more pennies in the jar
now, that's nice, see
i can't smack her,
but it's okay for you
i- i'm sorry every body,
but this lady's perspective is
a little too old testament for my taste
they'll come for you
maybe tonight,
when darkness comes
they'll come tonight,
and they'll take someone else
see if they don't
and when they do,
you will cry to god,
and you will beg mother carmody
to show you the way
that's fine
but until then,
if you don't shut up,
i'll wrap this tape around your mouth
you just try it, ollie weeks
and you, bitch
you hit me again
if you dare
you'll be on your knees to me
before this is through
those of you who aren't local
should know
that mrs carmody
is known in town for being
unstable
no shit
what was your first clue?
shh
hi
what's up, little dude?
how come your friends
don't come get us?
they got tanks and stuff, right?
why can't you just call 'em?
phones don’t work
but don't you got, like, a radio?
hey, champ, what's going on?
i want their friends
to come rescue us
they would if they could, pal
they're stuck here just like us
but...
shh now, guys, we could use
a hand over there
yeah, sure thing
troop, off your asses
you all right?
- i don't like that scary lady
oh, man, i don't either
but you know what?
maybe she's scared too
you think?
you think mommy's okay?
billy
i'm sorry about the times
i was bad to her
aw, hey
mommy loves you very much
and i'll bet she's fine
and i promise you,
i'm gonna do everything i can
to get us back to her
- okay?
- 'kay
- yeah?
- 'kay
so, we can use the charcoal fluid
and the mops
to make torches
and we've got knives and stuff,
god knows
this maybe
a silly question, bud, but
do you happen to have
a gun in the store?
here? no please
this... this isn't los angeles
i've got a shotgun in my truck
i could try for it if you want
oh, god, i don't think that'd be
a good idea, mr cornell
hold on
this gun, um
my husband's idea
he's away on business a lot
it's not even loaded
ain't much use unloaded, ma'am
um
you know how to use that?
well, i shot it once on a pistol range
hit the target a few times
so, we got a gun
anybody know how to shoot it?
well, i mean?
i do
you?
ollie please
some target shooting
state champion in '94
you're crazy if you go out there!
let us pass!
let us pass, please!
let's just talk this thing through
we have, and we've
made our decision we're leaving
hey, mr mackey's gonna barbecue
some chicken on the gas grill
why don’t we just
sit down and just...
what, and let you keep on talking?
no, i've been in far too many
courtrooms to fall for that
you've already psyched out
half a dozen of my people already
your people?
what kind of talk is that?
they're people, that's all
now... now listen, every one
we are experiencing
some kind of disaster
i don't know whether
it's manmade or natural,
but i do know that
it's definitely not supernatural
or biblical,
and, no offense, mrs carmody,
but the only way
we're gonna help ourselves
is to seek rescue
we're going out
- brent, look
- i'm not discussing this any further
i know i just want to ask a favor
tie this around your waist
what for?
it'll let us know you got
at least 300 feet
i'll do it
are you throwing in with them?
me? no thanks
i think your man there
is a little too tightly wound
gonna get somebody killed
but i'm thinkin' we could use
that shotgun of yours
i saw where you parked
when i pulled in
red pickup, right?
far entrance?
son, you got brass balls
the shells are
in the glove compartment
drive it back
all right
just see they're paying out this line
line's up, i'll cut her loose,
just so you understand
yeah
you sure there's no way
i can talk you out of this?
david
there's nothing out there
nothing in the mist
what if you’re wrong?
then, i guess
the joke would be on me after all
we're gonna send back help
you'll die out there
all of you
hey, crazy lady,
i believe in god too
i just don't think
he's the bloodthirsty asshole
you make him out to be
well, you take that up with the devil
when you run into him
you just chat it over at your leisure
well, let's strike out
toward the center of town
keep it loose
nice and easy
keep going
look
it's going
they're doing good
put it down!
pull!
oh, my god!
i'm slippin'!
pull! back up! back up!
back up!
get it off!
oh, my god
aw, sh...
blood!
awww, sh...!
oh, my god!
oh, my god!
cut the rope!
shut the door!
now do you see?
now do you believe?
about a half-hour of day light left
guys, how's it going
with these work lights?
we're gettin' 'em rigged up all right
yeah, check it out
all right, all right
save it, save it
these batteries ain't topped up
you turn the lights on,
it's gonna drain 'em quick
how quick?
- five minutes, maybe ten
- yeah, if that
okay, emergencies only
if something gets in the store
holy jesus,
you scared the shit outta me
oh, sally, i'm sorry, really
i thought i'd come in and say hi
and see how you were holding up
- hi
- hi
barely how about you?
i'm worried about my folks, i guess
you know, they live
up on shorm road
that's less than
five miles from here
how 'bout yours?
well, they're out of town right now
they're at my aunt's in boston, so
that's lucky
that means they're okay
i hope so
so
how soon you shipping out?
uh, couple weeks
scared about going over there?
yeah
- hey, wayne?
- hmm?
how come you never asked me out?
we flirted all through high school
i know you like me
so how come?
i'm stupid, i guess
oh, shit! i'm sorry
don't be i just...
i just didn't really want it
to happen like this, you know?
some shitty locker room at work
can we just stay in here
a while, then?
i mean, just... just you and me
the parking lot lamps
turned on
they're on a timer
must be a different one
that's live
maybe we could
tie into them somehow,
get some electricity in here
that'd mean walking out the door
gaaaahhhh! god!
oh, my god!
oh, my god!
david! david!
you sure?
look!
my god
are those bugs?
not like any i've ever seen
"they came out of the smoke,
"locusts upon the earth,
"and unto them was given power
even as the scorpions
of the earth have power"
wow
look at those stingers
dear god

attracted to the light
look out, look out, look out!

"and there came a voice
from the temple
"saying to the seven angels,
"'go your ways
and pour out the vials
of the wrath of god upon the earth"'
ollie,
the glass is gonna give!
shit!
oh, my god,

she was right
she said that
it would happen like this
she said that
they would come at night
she told us someone would die
mommy
ohh, shh, shh, shh
it's okay
it's okay, it was just a dream
it's just a bad dream
i want my mommy
i know
i know of course you do
- shh
i wanna go home
just sleep
everything'll be better in the morning
think he likes you
well, i hate that
i had to lie to him
you have kids?
no
i always wanted to, but
things haven't been working out
right now i'm thinking
maybe that's for the best
i saw creatures
fly into the store tonight that...
they shouldn't exist
i keep thinking i'm gonna
wake up in a rubber room
you're not alone in that
we're all right there with you
this isn't gonna end, is it?
david
it's joe he's getting worse
joe
how you holdin' up, partner?
david is that you?
yeah, pal, how you doin'?
it's bad he's bad
didn't know anything
could hurt like this
if you guys can't help me
you... you gotta end it, okay?
ollie's got that gun, right?
right?
- no. no way
you can't fuck with me
on this, bro
not with me like this
i'll do it
just give me the gun
hey, hey shh
- we're not there yet, okay?
- oh, please!
joe, now, listen
pal
we're gonna work something out
i just need you to hang in
a little longer, okay?
can we do that?
stay with him
i'll be back
hattie, i need to go to the bathroom
will you watch billy?
hattie
see anything?
the last of those bugs
went away about four
dawn's coming
what's on your mind?
it's joe
we don't get him
on some serious antibiotics,
he's gonna die of infection
plus he needs
painkillers in the worst way
all... all... all we got here
is liquor and aspirin
you... you thinkin' about goin'
to that pharmacy next door?
irene reppler say
they've got silvadene...
you know, the stuff
they use in burn wards
she knows where they keep it
slow down
you can't actually be thinkin'
of doin' this
i'm also thinkin' beyond that
we have to get out of here
i mean permanently.
why? we got plenty to eat!
what happens when one of those things
decides to break through this window?
i'm talkin' one of the big ones,
like the one that killed norm
yeah, and that flaming torch idea
didn’t work so well, did it?
we almost burned
the goddamn store down
it's hattie
here?
all right,
gently, now gently
one two three
i don't know
how long she was there like that,
lying there next to us
i thought she was sleeping
i got my 4-wheel drive
it's out there
y- you’re talking about leaving?
well, we
should hit the pharmacy first
we gotta bring back
supplies for the injured
i mean, if we don't,
joe eagleton's gonna die,
and we can't let that happen
but after that
look, my land cruiser
can hold eight people
i say we drive south
as far as the fuel takes us
and try to get clear of this mist
that's it?
that's the plan?
- that's what i got
- no, you can't mean it
not after what happened
to norton and his group
no, no, no amanda, think.
norton got over 200 feet
from this store
that's how much rope play ed out
i'm parked half that distance
from here
but who knows how far
this mist has spread?
it could be
the entire eastern seaboard
yeah, it could be the whole world,
for all we know
wouldn't make us any less dead,
now, would it?
we have one gun
- how many rounds?
we got ten left
ten rounds jesus
okay, so ten
want another reason
to get the hell out of here?
i'll give you the best one
her
mrs carmody
she's our very own jim jones
i'd like to leave before people
start drinking the kool-aid
he's right
flakier people get,
the better she's gonna look
no, i don't buy that
it's obvious she's nuts
look, a few people maybe, but...
no, i count four
she's preachin' to 'em right now
by noon, she'll have four more
by tomorrow night,
when those things come back,
she'll have a congregation,
and then we can start worryin'
about who she's gonna sacrifice
to make it all better
hmm?
you, amanda?
my little boy?
he's right
you don't have much faith
in humanity, do you?
none whatsoever
i can't accept that
people are
basically good, decent
my god, david,
we're a civilized society
sure, as long as
the machines are workin'
and you can dial 9-1-1,
but you take those things away,
you throw people in the dark,
you scare the shit out of them,
no more rules,
you’ll see how primitive they get
you scare people badly enough,
you can get 'em to do anything
they'll turn to whoever
promises a solution,
or whatever.
ollie, please, back me up here
i wish i could
as a species,
we're fundamentally insane
put more than two of us
in a room, we pick sides
and start dreaming up reasons
to kill one another
why do you think we invented
politics and religion?
oh, jesus, that's just
wrong
look, nobody has
to decide anything now, okay?
first things first...
the pharmacy
that'll be our test run
okay?
it's all right, big bill
i'm gonna bring you back
some comic books
i don’t want them
i want you to stay here
i won't be gone long
just... just next door
hey, you’ll be safe
daddy...
daddy, there are things out there
things...
yeah there's a lot
less of 'em in the daytime
they'll wait
they'll wait in the mist
where you can't see 'em,
and then when you go
and can't get back in
they'll come and eat you up!
- shh
- daddy, don't go!
i'll be back
big bill
i promise
i'll be back, and then
i'm gonna take you home
all right?
together, we're going home
if something happens,
anything at all,
you cut and run
you get your ass back in here,
for your boy's sake
if something happens to me,
i want you to take care of billy
best as you can,
and long as you can
land cruiser's yours now
you... you get him out of here
you just keep drivin'
where do you think you’re going,
mr david drayton on?
are you so anxious
to make your boy an orphan?
my boy is no concern of yours
listen up
we're going to the pharmacy
we're gonna bring back
some supplies
also, there maybe people
trapped over there who need help
listen, folks, listen!
we're not gonna take any chances
if there's any trouble,
we'll come straight back here
to the supermarket
and bring the fiends of hell
down on our heads, thank you
she's right
you'll make 'em notice us
you'll make 'em come
why can't you just leave
well enough alone?
lady, this what you call
'"well enough"?
you wanna stop us?
you better explain to bobby here
why we're not bringin' painkillers
and medicine back for his brother
i'm goin', even if i have to go alone
you'll die out there, young man
you'll walk out that door
and be torn to shreds,
and then your hell-bound pride
will have them come get the rest of us
yes, they'll come back for all of us,
just like this good lady said
do you want that
to happen, people?
no!
no! no! no!
well, it is this kind of hubris
that brought the wrath of god
in the first place
this kind of pride and defiance of...
shut up, you miserable buzzard!
you old bitch!
stoning people who piss you off
is perfectly okay
they do it in the bible, don't they?
and i got lots of peas
david, please, if you want to go,
now's the time
how 'bout it, army?
any help from the armed forces?
i'll go
jim grondin
i had you in school, didn't i?
yes, me and my sister pauline
pair of underachievers

expiation, because we have seen
the earth scourged
with whips and scorpions
we have seen the earth
vomit forth from her lips
obscenities and profanities
of such nightmare proportions
and for these evil,
lurking spirits,
and for these evil people
how long was i out?
most of the day
you just came over here to lay down
and went to sleep
just passed out, is more like it
what will stop this great whore?
just shut down for a while
sorry
how will it end?
expiation!
expiation!
do you remember yesterday when
how's joe?
dead joe died of his burns
while you were asleep
we were just too late
i told you this would come!
oh, god,
i thought i was dreaming her voice
no dream
she's getting people whipped up
that poor girl is dead,
and that boy is burnt in the back room!
she's got 'em believing
she's a psychic,
she has a direct line with god
why wouldn't they?
woman never shuts up
like those speeches
castro used to make
ollie say you’re thinking of leaving
i'm in
no sorry
i mean, come on, you saw what
happened to bobby mike
i won't
do that again
i won't be responsible
you might want to reconsider that
what will... what will keep these evil,
these abominations at bay?
what will keep them away?
"the rock will not hide them
the dead tree gives no shelter"
what will end it?
let me hear it
- expiation!
- what are we talking about?
- expiation!
- say it again like you mean it!
expiation!
welcome to sesame street
today's word is "expiation"
hallelujah! hallelujah!
that boy hasn't been right
since the pharmacy
his mind's just snapped
gone
hasn't even been two day s
not even two day s
i'm not spendin' the rest
of my life here, i'll tell you what
i can quietly gather up
some bags of groceries
and hide them up at one of
the check stands by the door
it was your idea
it's your vehicle
it'll be your call
i'd rather die out there trying
than in here waiting
who will save them? no one
the rocks will not hide them
i want some idea
of what we’re up against
i want to know what this mist is
i want to talk to the soldiers
soldiers? what's that gonna do?
you heard what that mp said
at the pharmacy
david, i'm not even sure
i knew he was talking
the situation was insane
he said he was sorry
wasn't that the word
he used... "sorry"?
that's right
he said it was their fault, right?
what did he mean by that?
that's what we’re gonna find out
irene, stay with billy, please
verse 17!
"poured out his vial into the air,
"and there came a great voice
"out of the temple of heaven
from the throne, saying,
"'it is done! it is done! '
"and there were voices
and lightning,
and thunders,
and a great earthquake"
yes! come to me!
what?
- where's your friends?
- i ain't seen 'em
not that big a store
it's kinda hard to lose
i ain't seen 'em, i said
i look like their keeper?
- what do you want from me?
- what do you know about this mist?
i don't know nothin'
i got nothin' to do with it
that's not what the mp
said in the pharmacy
before the spiders
came out of his skin
they're not in the store
the only place we haven't looked
is the loading dock
because you know
you saw the good face
of god tonight
yes? tell us
here is an old man
who has seen!
yes, he has seen!
amen
and i want to say,
do i want to walk with you
into my father's hands?
morales
donaldson
guys
it's the only place they can be
what?
couldn’t just disappear
look, i told you,
okay, i don't know where they are...
i didn't think they'd do it
they said they would do it,
and i just...
i told them what
the mp said at the pharmacy,
and they swore they'd do it
i just... i didn't think they would
jesus
it's the arrowhead project,
isn't it?
this mist, it's some kind of, what,
military fuckup?
what were you guys
messin' with up there, huh?
we got you now,
you sorry son of a bitch!
get in there!
it was them!
it was them what done it to us!
it was them what brung down
the final wrath upon us!
those two peckerwoods that
he's been with this whole time,
they hung themselves in the back
because they knew!
they knew it all along!
- he's crazy he doesn't know...
- get on your knees!
stay out of it, drayton on!
they heard it too, didn't you?
all of ya!
all about the arrowhead project
and all that secret shit
up on the mountain
that's what brung it down on us
that's what brung down
the wrath of god!
oh!
private jessup
it wasn't me.
i'm just...
i'm stationed up there
i'm not responsible...
- bullshit!
- hell, i'm a local!
most of you people know me
you stop your chicken shit whining
or i will cut your puling tongue out
now you tell us!
tell us
look, look okay, okay
i heard stuff
stuff?
yes, we all heard stuff
like how they, um,
how they thought
that there were other dimensions,
you know, other...
other worlds all around us,
and how they wanted
to try and make, um,
a window...
you know, so they could look through
and see what's on the other side
well, maybe your window
turned out to be a door didn't it?
not mine! those scientists'!
oh, the scientists!
yes, the scientists!
they must have ripped
a hole open by accident
this other world
came spilling through to ours
that's what donaldson was saying
to me right before he killed himself
i didn't understand the half of it
it ain't my fault!
oh
ain't his fault
no, no, no
ain't nothin'
ever anybody's fault
but he denies it
he points the finger,
this judas in our midst
judas!
david!
you! you!
don't you know by now?
don't you know the truth?
we are being punished
for what? for going
against the will of god!
for going against
his forbidden rules of old!
walking on the moon!
yes! yes!
- or... or splitting his atoms!
amen!
or... or... or stem cells
and abortions!
and destroying the secrets of life
that only god above has any right to!
amen! amen!
yes, i know! it is true!
and now we are being punished
the judgment is being
brought down upon us
the fiends of hell,
you see they are let loose,
and star wormwood blazes!
and it is his fault!
no! no! it is not my fault! no!
they did it! they spit
in the eye of the almighty!
no!
get over there!
no!
judas!

smell his blood!

have to wait and see

people who refused to bend
to the will of god,
and claim it privilege
sinners in pride

privileged!
they mock us they mock our...
our god, our faith,
our values, our very lifestyle
they mock our humility
and our piousness
they piss on us and laugh

must come
from them
