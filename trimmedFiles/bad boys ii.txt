hopefully in a few hours

we'll hit from three directions:
we'll go in with a water team, vehicle
assault and we got guys on foot.
we cannot make a move until our ucs
have id'd the drugs and called us in.
no call, we back away.
and these guys we're going after...
...they got a lot of firepower and they
hate the law. so eyes open out there.
bravo's on the move.

incinerating trash like you.
ready to die, right, marcus?
- the fuck i want to do that for?
- scared, ain't you, boy?
a: put the gun down, tell me
who brings this shit in...
...and maybe i'll just
pop one in your shoulder.
or b: keep acting all brody
and i'll put one in your chest.
or c: you know, take the time
to talk a minute.
you know, de-escalate the situation.
see, that's my partner's
new spiritual bullshit.
me? i actually prefer shooting
motherfuckers.
a lot of movement going on.
can't see the ucs.
- i think something's going down.
- don't move yet.
mike, the man has a gun to my head.
he'll put it down if a hollow point's
in his eye!
your partner's a cocky nigger.
- damn. now, was that necessary, sir?
- see?
he can't just be a cop?
he got to be a nigga too?
i'll hot this fool.
- calm down.
- calm down? i'm calm.
i'm calm! hey! whoa! whoa!
i am way too unstable
for that bullshit.

we can't let you all go, but this
shit'll get worked out in court.
we got our rights.

to shut the fuck up.
i'm all right. i'll give you a warning.
it's the best i can do for all of youse!

but i ain't saying i shot you
in the ass.
i ain't saying i didn't shoot you...
...but, damn! somebody shot you
in the ass.
tell me about it.
- yo, man, how's it feel?
- it's hot, man.
i can smell my ass burning.
mike, you should give it a little kiss
so it'll feel better.
pretend like we're not even here.
hey, isn't ricky martin having
a concert? get the fuck on.
- you always gotta go racial, man.
- it's sad, man.
i think it's cool. it hit the meat.
it ain't nowhere near the hole.
two lousy bags?
what about the biggest shipment
of ecstasy to come out of amsterdam?
let me worry about my snitch,
all right?
it's a lot of cop work for nothing!
take your ass home somewhere.
tonight la policia jacked my mules.
who can tell me how those jackals
knew where to bite johnny tapia?
speak up, cousins.
you're lucky they did not find
my drugs on dixie 7.
change the boat schedule.
we can't.
we got a shipment thursday.
change it after.
just keep them guessing.
you know, unlike you, my daddy
didn't leave me no trust fund.
i got real-world shit
to deal with, mike.
i'm not in it for the thrills.
same old shit, different day.
all right, yes, damn.
i shot you, all right?
but you'd be seeing nothing at all
if i hadn't made my move.
i don't know why
you acting so angry.
- you're misinformed. i'm not angry.
- no, you're very angry.
no, i'm not angry.
you are angry. it's okay.
i'm not angry. except when
you keep repeating "you're angry."
that shit's fucking annoying.
like a fucking gnat at a barbecue.
just bugging the fuck out of me.
good. i want you to say:
"i'm angry. it's okay.
i'll process my anger.
i love myself.
whoosah."
i don't know what the fuck
you mean.
yes, you do know what the fuck
i mean.
you're the one that needs therapy.

capt. howard made me do it after
i shot them people at the airport.
whoosah.
whoosah!
officer mike.
- papi. that's "daddy," right?
- yeah.

mike, you go to therapy
to get your issues worked out...
...not bang your therapist.

maybe i did the group thing
once or twice.
whoosah.
- and whoosah.
- whoosah.
a bunch of men hugging and kissing,
that's some cult shit.
buy.
ignore him, doc, he's blowing
this out of proportion.
my ass is what's out of proportion,
mike, okay? i got a big chunk missing.
it's actually a small chunk.
this tension you bringing
into this relationship...
...won't be healthy
in the long run.
maybe there ain't gonna be
no long run.
whatever.
he's seeing a shrink. i mean...
- icepick, lowrey.

two bags? you embarrassed me
in front of my people.
wait, brother. no, no, no, brother.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
whatever. you better pray
to whoever it is you pray to...
...because you got 24 hours
to find that x before i find you.
the cops hit my mule.
well, mr. tapia, i don't know
where the heat is coming from.
it's a delicate situation
for both of us, isn't it?

...last night there was something
different in your eyes.
you know, mike, i had an epiphany.

dropped a witness off last month.
mike is so sweet.
- so sweet he make your teeth rot.
- so have you told him yet?
baby, soon, okay? real soon.
he needs to know you're transferring
and won't be his partner anymore.
theresa, timing is everything.
marcus is not very happy
with me right now.
no, no, syd, i'm telling you, that is
scarface limping around in there.
we need to give that boy a few
minutes to let his butt heal up good.
we like each other.
what's the big deal?
i'm just gonna go tell him right now,
because this is dumb.
hold up. hold up. i'm gonna tell him.

on vacation.
i'm staying
at the most amazing hotel.
the view, the pool. oh, my god.

that ain't exactly a pool, man.
that's like a big-ass puddle
wrapped in blue plastic.
didn't they have any good pools
when you bought this one?
megan, that pool cost $3900.
okay, so how much

"i would like to see how
your machine works, baby."
i wouldn't be so crude.

of a human being.

how many jobs did you do with
my friends up there in new york?
quite a few.
how you behave with me
has consequences for a lot of people.
you found me,
not the other way around.
you need me to change small bills to
large ones and deliver to a third party.
i bet he'd like his money
in a timely fashion.
delivery's late, it's your ass,
not mine.
here's 50,000 in 100s
for your 50,000 in 10s.
third party takes his million
in these five briefcases here.
- i hope i'm not losing you, chief.
- i hate math.
so for your $3 million
that we shrunk for you...
...you get 2 million in clean money
back.
less our percentage: $300,000.
- i'll be delivering these to your dealer.
- alexei.
- what?
- we're giving too fucking much away.
we take all the risk.
and our suppliers take too much
of our profit.
yeah, we'll call the general,
renegotiate.
he's a businessman,
we're businessmen.
yeah, call him.

and please call off your dogs.
i got dea watching my back,
so don't blow my case.
- we saved your life.
- and i appreciate that.
what i don't appreciate is
you two following me here...
...nearly burning a case
that took five months to set up.
so now we lie to each other?
is that what we do?
- what do you want me to do?
- all right.
- fuck that, mike, she's wrong.
- calm down. relax.
syd, are there drugs in that truck?
- there's cash.
- where's it going?
- i can't tell you that.
- why not?
because i have a career and if i
want to keep it, i have rules to follow.
what's that mean?
my orders are, under no circumstances
share information with miami pd...
...because they got too many leaks.
- oh. i'm miami pd now?
you done forgot i'm your big brother,
huh?
you know what, syd,
that shit you did was reckless...
...it was stupid and it was dangerous.
okay?
i'm telling mommy. okay?
i'm definitely leaking that shit.
hey, marcus...
syd, come on, he got a point.
your brother loves you.
not to mention a little thing
called professional courtesy.
you bouncing in somebody's yard,
you should let them know about it.
first time using your gun?
hey, you handled yourself
very well.
too bad your partner didn't notice.
thanks.
think you get off that easy? you
been working this for five months?
how come you ain't tell me
in new york?
- what would you have said?
- i would've...
i'd have let you know this job
is rugged, you know.
it's dangerous. and if something
happen to you i might...
exactly why i didn't say anything.
somebody's stealing your money.
the drop's done. i gotta go.
thanks.
we gotta close this case
before it get her killed.
yeah, no doubt.
you ready to go back to the station,
get our asses whupped?
i think we gonna be all right.
fellas.
what's your job description?
no, you two.
what is your job description?
i'll tell you.
tnt:
tactical narcotics team.
keyword: "tactical."
"displaying finesse and subtlety
in achieving a goal!"
tell me, gentlemen...
...what was subtle about your work
today?
twenty-two cars...
...and a boat, totaled?
how did you sink a boat?
we didn't sink it.
whoosah.
all right, the positive.
thank god no cops died.
the negative: i got a police
commissioner so far up my ass...
...if he spits it's coming out
of my mouth.
but i know that there's
always two sides to a story.
so, what's yours?
well, i was at a family barbecue.
we got a tip that the zoepounders...
...were gonna do a hit on cash or
drugs from this big-time x-man.
that's what they call
a ecstasy dealer on the streets.
marcus, i know what they call them.
that's why i'm captain. it's cool.
so you got the drugs.
no drugs. oh, okay. all right.
how about the money?
- no money.
- nope.
then who is this x-man?
captain, i was at a family barbecue.
so i...
we don't know,
but we are going to find out.
well, then all that...
...was for nothing?
- we didn't do all of that.
if you look close...
watch. hold up. let me s...
there's dea all over.
wait, the... wait, hold up.
the dea? without consulting me?!
that's a dea car right there.
christ! fuck!
cap. no. remember
your pressure points.
do my... my exercises.
- holler at your boy.
- whoosah.
twenty-one thousand?
what?!
oh, kiss my black ass.
it was the dashboard.
- you know what?
- better.
yeah, you'll get your money.
somebody's on they way
with your money.
is it possible we could discuss
potential reimbursement...
we don't cover personal property.
that's why we drive police cars.
so where do we go from here?
zoepounders knew exactly when
to hit the drop, where to hit the drop...
...so we figure they know
where the cash is.
we find the cash, we find the x-man.
hey, i'm through playing games,
all right? i have three cops critical.
i got kids dying on my streets
from souped-up x.
i do not want these animals
taking over my city.
do you understand?
so i want you guys to do whatever you
do, whatever it takes, but do it now.
it's not good, boss.
oh, my god.
fucking ratones eating
my fucking money.
carlos, this is a stupid
fucking problem to have.
but it is a problem nonetheless.
rat fuckers.
rat fuckers.
boss, it ended up crazy.
this black chica working for the
russians was a maniac lunatic.
she saved your money.
she wasted some haitians
and got the load to the drop.
also, roberto saw these two
crazy gangbanger homeys.
- oh, shit.
- yeah. chasing and shooting.
old days, did i have
this problem? no.
just fly the drugs in
and ship the money out.
now american security's
so goddamned tight over the water...
...and in the sky...
...that the rats eat my money
before i can get it to cuba.
- you see?
- fiery crash...
i can't even get my money across town
without making the news.
hey, man. man.
tell me...
...should i be worried?
- no, boss.
- shut the fuck up.
people is trying to jack my loads
here in miami.
i own this fucking town. you see?
this is my town.
oh, my god. pink.
pink, niña, pink. pink.
no powder blue.
pink is prettier.
but the lady at the store
said i look like a model.
you're lucky your mother
was my mother's cousins.
don't pay attention to roberto.
besides, models are filthy creatures.
you look more like an angel.
- what do you think, carlos?
- of course.
- roberto, what do you think?
- it's fucking beautiful.
talk polite in front
of my little bonbon...
...or i'm gonna chop your balls off.
for real, i'm straight with all your
spiritual enlightenment and that shit.
but i need to know if a crackhead rolls
to me with a.9, you'll cook that fool.
no question about it.
shoot him in the leg.
come on with that leg shit.
- everybody deserves a little dignity.
- what about my dignity?
your crackhead will be missing
a kneecap. i'll be in a body bag.
- so sad.
- what's so sad?
your untreated control issues.
it's not your fault.
what in the hell
is that supposed to mean?
your mama probably refused you
her tit when you were a baby.
you grew up a malnourished
high-school softie.
got your gun, little tight t-shirt...
...and became
a overcompensating tough guy.
that is the last time you will ever
refer to my mother's titties.
i don't even want them

hey, look here, man.
can you tell me who was driving
the black suburban?
oh, he don't know nothing.
his brains is under the end table.
he can't tell us shit, mike.
- he's all fucked up.

- we need to see what's on this video.
- absolutely.
you got a little bullet hole in there.
you guys tell me about it?
guess not. we'll put this
in our central floor model.
it has kick-ass bass.
you like hip-hop? i love it.
we freestyle in the break room. if you
guys ever want to kick it, we'll flow.
we're gonna set you up on
the wide-screen. correct ratio.
there you go.
"spanish palms mortuary."
why would they be doing
surveillance at a funeral home?
is that a cuban flag?
right there. see the gun?
never knew guards at funeral homes
needed to carry them kind of weapons.
it just seems like
we should turn it off...
...because my dad owns the store.
she got a tongue ring.
- this is like a porno. we're not...
- dude. dude.
- all right?
- yeah.
okay. okay.
it's just, you know,
my dad's gonna be...
i just need to... i think i...
- i think i screwed this up.
- relax.
- my dad's gonna... this is like a porno.
- oh, yeah. i want more.
- okay.
- this is official police business.
- what the fuck's going on here?
- out of my way.
my dad is coming.
my dad is coming.
what the hell is going on
in my store?
son, how did this porno crap get
on my videos in my store?!
what the hell is going on in here?!
- you all right?
- no, i'm not all right, mike.
three days of this shit.
got my nerves all rattled.
my ass still hurts...
...from what you did to it
the other night.
oh, my lord.
yeah, it got rough.
you know?
i mean, we got caught up
in the moment, shit got crazy.
you know how i get.
when you popped me from behind,
i think you damaged some nerves.
okay.
now, i can't...
i can't... now, i can't...
- can't what?
- i can't even get an erection.
what's an erection?
i tried taking viagra, you know,
pop one, pop two.
been eating them like skittles.
that poor man is pouring out
his heart.
and i'm still flaccid.
okay. i'm comfortable talking
to you...
it's got 5.1 dolby.
...about what i did to your ass...
...but you not getting an erection...
...that's a real problem for me.
- i just figured i could talk to you.
- yeah. no, no.
we're... we partners, but we are
partners with boundaries.
we got a new rule.
from now on you can't say
the word "flaccid" to me.
he's a mean fuck.
look here.
this is our little boundary box.
so we gonna take the word
"flaccid"...
...and we're gonna put it in there
with my mom's titties...
...with your erection problems,
and we're gonna close this box...
...and we're gonna throw
this bitch in the ocean.
and the only way that you can
get to this box...
...is you got to be motherfucking
jacques cousteau.
we cool?
oh, shit.
we gotta go.
in front of my babies you got porno
and homo shows up in here?
what kind of freak-ass store is this?
and you two motherfuckers
need jesus.
cover your ears, baby.
palm mortuary, owned by an offshore
holding company...
...which, after 17 layers of bullshit...
...turns out to be registered
to donna maria tapia...
...mother of hector juan carlos tapia,
who calls himself johnny.
johnny tapia. shit.
every time the pd goes after him...
...he sues for wrongful arrest.
and, oh, does he win.
last year he was awarded $9 million.
and got a dozen dumb-ass officers
like you fired.
well, he hasn't run across us yet.
we'd love to hear what's going on
in that house.
use your computer brain
and tap the phone.
well, that happens to be
highly illegal without a judge.
we were thinking of something more
along the lines of a training operation.
no, i can't do that.
- get you tickets to the heat game.
- i need floor seats.
with thick-ass glasses
you don't need floor seats.
he can see the game
from the parking lot.
- i can't work under these conditions.
- floor seats to the heat. you got it.
- lakers.
- yes, lakers.
okay. watch me work.
hello? is this the pest control?
yeah. we got a fucking problem.
you know where we live.
- yeah, south miami.
- we got it.
got our way in.
- illegally?
- you got to put a word to it.
it's like, secret.
so y'all want to kill roaches?
- illegal.
- we'll plant a couple gypsy wires...
...find out what tapia's up to.
these are your basic household bugs.
dog, this is what we do.
- what's the sprayers for?
- the roaches.
- roaches? we got rats.
- say what?
that's not an issue.
we can handle that.
we'll just have to slightly adjust
our approach a little bit.
nope. nope. i don't mess
with no rats.
hey. stop it.
- we're in. get your head right.
- mike, i'm a grown-ass man.
get your grown-ass self together
and let's do this.
- you got a beautiful house, sir.
- well, start looking.
they're all over.
those ain't normal rats.
what he means is that they're
obviously a special breed.
- what kind of breed are they?
- big motherfuckers.
disposing of the rats isn't a problem.
but we should ensure there's no
breeding elsewhere in the house.
yeah, at zook...
...we like to work from the outside in,
you know.
so we gonna leave these...
excuse me.
we'll leave these here
and send in a special unit.
it'd be better to begin
in the rest of the house.
you're not getting
in the rest of the house.
we won't be able
to guarantee our work.
the only thing that we can
guarantee...
...is that these rats will keep fucking.
giving off offspring
until we find the colony.
rats don't got no stinking colony.
well, actually these are colonial rats.
what they do is they send out
worker rats that are called...
marsupials.
marsupials.
these drones, they're explorers
of the rat world, you know.
they just looking for rat pussy.
- you know.
- are you fucking with me?
hold on. you called us.
we can leave.
but what you should understand is
that these rats will hump twice a day.
all right. down there. just kill them
and bring me the bill.
that's that bullshit.
that's that bullshit right there.
- you see these rats?
- plant your wires.
- you're not leaving me with them.
- plant your wires.
gentlemen. alexei, josef.
oh, i really like that word, johnny.
"gentlemen."
i'm just trying being civil.
this is business, we can all relax.
- alexei, would you like a cohiba?
- why not?
of course. and you? josef.
i'm told you're a wine connoisseur.
i am.
carlos, have josef pick a wine and
alexei and i will have a cigar. come.
- where the fuck you going?
- pretty bad problem you got here.
i'm gonna head down to the truck,
get some poison pellets and stuff.
come straight back.
no screwing around.
they're all over.
nice place you got here.
it's mama's. and it's a shithole.
built a fucking million years ago.
- expensive shithole, eh?
- oh, no.
my new place i'm building in cuba.
esto va a set tremendo, brother.
almost finished. everything fucking
shiny new. come on upstairs.
oh, shit.
oh, shit! look at the balls
on that motherfucker.
roberto...
...the general's office camera is out.
- everything in this house is broken.
my wire's planted.
- how about yours?
- almost got three wires planted.
mike!
there's a papa rat humping
the shit out of this mama rat.
no, he's straight pile-driving her!
now, how is that information
gonna help me do my job?
they fuck just like us.
where's the pest guy?
there's something going on
down here.
goddamn rats.
yeah, they everywhere.
just like cockroaches.
no disrespect...
...but i do not wish to talk business
until my partner return.
it's baffling. you secretly decide to pay
me less and you talk about respect?
let's wait for josef. you know,
me and digits.
carlos, could you bring josef in?
so...
...your partner is here.
would you like to talk now?
carlos, another box.
so you sign over ownership papers
for all the florida clubs you own...
...and i will control everything...
...from point of origin to sale. okay?
no middleman. especially russian
middleman.
with all due respect, mr. tapia...
...in my country, i see such things
all the time.
i'm sorry for your country.
that must be some cuban stupid
tradition to put them in a tortilla bin.
now, listen to me, you russian punk.
i, me, johnny tapia,
will sever your head off!
you kill me and you will have
a shit-storm.
should i screw your young wife...
...or visit your son,
the soccer player?
my daughter knows your son.
- you're gonna regret this.
- i hope that we can remain friends.
because at the end, what else
do we have but friendship, trust...
...honor.
without this,
we are no more than beasts.
the kitchen monitor's out.
what the hell's going on out there?
shit.
i found something.
- it's a guy's finger.
- what, did the rats eat the rest of him?
- what the fuck are you doing?
- hey, i was just looking for you.
i think i figured out your problem.
y'all a bunch of filthy motherfuckers.
blow out!
- what's going on? shit!
- get out of the house!
this shit's got to stop.
fuck!
we should go.
go! go!
just another day with mike lowrey.
- damn! go!
- come on!
roberto thinks they were
the gangbangers...
...that tried to hijack the drop, boss.
how did this thing happen?
i don't know. we called the rat people
and these guys showed up.
maybe you're the rat, huh?
they tried to steal from me, and
you let them into my mother's house.
johnny. hey, no.
i would never...
nobody puts in danger
my daughter, my mother...
...or my money.
send him to the mortuary.
johnny. johnny,
what happened to roberto?
he killed himself, mama.
- very sad.
- write a nice letter to his mother.
i'll do it.
okay. bye.
- yo, run the print.
- mike, stop playing, man!
- run the print.
- don't touch me with no dead finger.
excuse me, run this print.
i need to find the owner.
thank you.
think you can find out
what's on these shreds?
of course.
we're thinking about ordering lunch.
should we put you down for some extra
crispy and a couple of grape sodas?
"couple of grape sodas."
- very funny. that's hilarious.
- isn't it low tide?
i think it is.
- don't you have relatives to pick up?
- what?
yo, now you crossed the line, man.
okay, no, that's not funny.
we're fucking with you. we planted
wires, we need some help. no bullshit.
i want you...
...to find out...
...who those two black
puta de mierda are.
and i want them lying right here...
...in mama's garden
in these coffins!
and our mystery finger
belongs to:
josef kuninskavich.
he was a lieutenant in a russian mob.
owned a couple dozen
florida nightclubs.
tapia's starting to knock off
russian mob bosses.
got something.
what you got, dickhead?
the computer matches half tones,
gray tones, densities.
sort of like a visual code-breaking.
little something i put together.
the shredded papers was a photo.
some kind of boat. "dixie 7."
dixie 7.
- it's registered to a one floyd poteet.
- the poteet brothers.
one of the kkk guys we busted.
you blew his ear off, remember?
mike, can you teach me
how to shoot people?
listen to what we got at tapia's.
the second-in-command is talking.
he's telling him, "yes, boss. we
found a bunch of fat doe fuckers...
...and we're getting them emptied."
- fat does emptied?
- the hell does that mean?
- he has a meeting this afternoon.
- you know who i am?
- name sounds familiar.
sense of humor. i like that.
meet me on the sand,
- she has no idea. let's roll.
- y'all come with us.
i ordered a couple
of bacardi mojitos.
miami.
okay, zoom in on nine.
a little more audio, please.
so, why don't we take a swim?
cool off.
or we could just stay here
and get drunk. how about that?
or we could drink this later.
unless you have a reason...
...why you don't want to get
that beautiful body of yours wet.
why not just ask
if i'm wearing a wire?
i'd rather go swimming.
- what the hell's he doing?
- son of a bitch.
shit. he's taking her into the water.
this guy's smart.
i want you to work for me. why waste
time on this unnecessary talking?
it's very unnecessary. what do
you need with another banker?
for the same reason
as your previous employer.
but now i own all the russian clubs.
no middleman.
i'm about to be the biggest importer
and distributor of x in north america.
you're gonna be a very rich young
woman. that's why i thought...
i know what you thought, mr. tapia.
as long as you don't think it
more than once...
...i'm happy to be in business
with you.
all right.
let's do business.
what are you,
a cop or a model?
what do you mean? i threw something
on. i like looking good. what?
for who?
don't hate the player.
hate the game.
i hate the tailor.
good job. we'll get him.
your brother would love to talk
to you down the street.
whoa, what's going on?
you trying to blow my case
or you just insane?
you're the one taking a dip
with the cubano maniac.
- how'd you know that?
- we had a wire in the house.
- you two have a warrant for that wire?
- look, fuck that, okay?
you don't know the kind of danger
that you're in, syd.
i am fully aware and i am fully capable
of what i am doing.
i am not your baby sister anymore.
for the dea you ain't nothing
but a honeypot.
what'd you just say?
that's why you got the job, because
you look good in a bathing suit.
all right, let's sit down somewhere.
all right, look, syd, there's
some shit you need to know.
johnny tapia is cutting up russian
mob bosses in his mom's kitchen.
in the kitchen, syd.
he found a severed finger
by the crock pot.
you're about to be in the middle
of a drug war.
miami pd has arrested this guy
why don't you just hang back
and let us bring him down?
guys, look, i need this, okay?
and i am this close.
what's "this close"?
i'm in charge of money laundering
for his entire operation.
in a month or two we'll have enough
for a conviction and it'll be over.
what about a day or two?
sound better?
marcus and i think we found the key
to tapia's whole operation.
you have nothing to say now, huh?
- just stuck, right?
- okay, time-out, y'all. damn.
we got this peckerwood
that'll put us down...
...with the transport end of tapia's
operation. do you want in?
- why would you...?
- when?
- tonight.
- page me.
should i bring my thong?
get your bitch hands off.
i'll knock you the fuck out.
mike, we're trying to keep her
out of trouble, man...
...not invite her in.
man, i just figured, you know,
if she with us...
...that's just less trouble
she could get into.
i'm gonna keep it real with you too,
man. i think she can handle herself.
i'm gonna keep it real with you.
don't nobody know my sister like i do.
okay? she doesn't
make good choices, mike.
- she's not street-smart.
- doesn't make good...?
- like, what kind of choices?
- men, for one.
she's attracted to these dumb...
...flashy, just musclebound dickheads,
mike. you know?
cock diesel motherfuckers that can't
even fucking turn to wipe their ass.
- you feel me?
- yeah.
you know? just dumb
as a bucket of shrimp.
yeah. yeah. that shit's crazy.
i mean, you don't think maybe you...
maybe you didn't, like,
get a chance to know any of them?
i'm gonna give the next one
a chance.
a chance to whup his ass.
- whup the shit out of him.
- oh, you gonna fight him?
what i'm gonna do
ain't even gonna be legal.
i might be up in here
with these motherfuckers.
do you know what i mean?
the fuck you looking at?
thank you kindly.
thank you kindly.
- who sprung me?
- hey, cousin floyd.
- oh, you.
- remember me?
cheese.
y'all look great together.
- what the fuck you doing?
- just a little insurance.
you gonna help us find dixie 7...
...and tell us what that boat
has to do with johnny tapia.
- i ain't no snitch.
- oh, you ain't no snitch?
- oh, damn. that's a shame.
- know what i'm gonna do?
i'm gonna send a special 8 x 10
to his kkk buddies back in jail.
you know what,
it's a digital photo too.
so we can do
whatever we want to do with it.
by the time we get done with you...
...you gonna be in the next
busta rhymes video on bet.
tuck ass.
i got my rights.
i'm worried. there's too much heat
around in miami.
i can feel it. i can feel it.
we need to put my money in coffins
to cuba faster.
you should tell the mortuary
to speed things up. all right?
that's the channel marker
way out there.
they make the drop mostly at dawn,
but there'll be one today, though.
syd, you talk to mama?
she's got hives.
oh, and i told mama
about your cubano boyfriend.
he ain't invited to christmas dinner.
change the station.
more music, less marcus.
if you open the door he'll be a black
dr. phil for the next 40 minutes.
syd, you might not want to get
too flirty with mike.
your boyfriend might cut off
his trigger finger.
maybe mike's been flirting with me.
did you ever think about that?
trigger mike?
not like this. don't play
with that boy.
- seriously. don't play with that boy.
- just tell him about new york.
- do it.
- tell me what?
oh, shit. is he walking
down the steps?
oh, shit. he coming down.
- it's okay.
- yeah, you done fucked up.
you done fucked up.
you remember...
remember i went to new york?
you remember?
and...
...i said, "syd."
i ran in...
syd ran into me in new york
on the street in that place.
and i said:
"what's up?"
and we was hungry, so then...
...she had fish.
it was grouper.
and then i had some chicken.
remember i was supposed
to come home?
but i didn't.
we went out on a date.
five, actually.
now we're seeing each other.
hold up.
you know, really out of respect
for you, marcus, nothing happened.
hey, mike, why you tripping, man?
i mean, we wanted to make sure
you was cool with it.
doesn't matter what i think, you know.
hey, i had to find out like this, right?
don't matter.
let me ask you, y'all gonna have
babies? little bunch of mini mikes?
bunch of little lying, violent
motherfuckers?
marcus, nothing happened.
i just want to say,
mama's gonna be thrilled.
all right, you know what, you need to
"whoosah" or something for a second.
hey, here comes the dixie 7.
whoosah.
just leave it alone.
- why you acting like that?
- go on about your business, man.
- we gonna talk about this.
- no. get out of my face.
- i'm trying to talk to you.
- get the fuck off me, mike.
what the hell is your problem, man?!
why you acting so stupid?!
this is a dysfunctional partnership.
that's why i'm acting like that.
- you know...
- there ain't no trust.
i didn't lie to you!
i was waiting for the right time
to tell you. but that ain't your issue.
why don't you bring it to me real.
what is your problem with this?!
you know what? you a dog, man.

we lost the coffin...
...and you barbecued
our only lead, mike.
this has got to be the worst, most
emotional cop week of my life.
yeah, it's been a little rough.
- where were these bodies going?
- i don't know. it's really strange.
all the john does we found
out here are empty.
empty does. fat does.
cut them open, took the organs out.
sewed them back up.
nice work.
the more you guys fuck up,
the more we look like rock stars.
the van you was chasing
is a transport for the city morgue.
the john does were being delivered
to the university for medical research.
- nice going.
- i can't believe you guys.
do you both wake up
in the morning, call each other up?
"good morning, marcus."
"morning, mike."
"how you doing?"
"a'ight."
"so how are we gonna fuck up
the captain's life today?"
"gee, i don't know."
"i don't know."
"ooh. look, over there.
let's kill three fat people...
...and leave them on the street."
they were dead
before we ran over them.
it doesn't matter whether they
were dead or not, goddamn it!
every time you leave a corpse
on the street...
...i have to get these forensic coroner
guys to come to see what happened.
then i gotta get detectives.
see? they're detecting shit.
then i gotta get these forensic guys
to stick them back in the fucking bag!
jesus christ!
you guys, you're like...
you're like a bunch
of bloodsucking ticks...
...draining the life's blood
out of this department.
- whoosah.
- damn the whoosah, captain.
- did you just call me a tick?
- i was referring to him.
- thought so.
- these aren't normal corpses.
if i threw you out
of a speeding ice truck...
...and then ran over your head,
you wouldn't be normal either.
think about this for a second.
these bodies have been emptied...
...from a drug smuggler that just
happens to own a mortuary.
i got a bunch of bodies waiting
with plenty of room in them...
...i could smuggle some shit.
- johnny tapia has the perfect cover.
- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
johnny tapia?
i want a warrant to go
into his mortuaries immediately.
no warrant. what?
for what? for what?
for a bunch of dead guys
on their way to med research?
no. every time we go after him,
he sues us and wins.
this shit stops now
or they'll fire us, disband tnt...
...and stick me in a fucking coffin.
- this is over now!
- what happened to "whatever it takes"?
that was pre-vehicular manslaughter.
not to mention johnny tapia...
- what the fuck is that?
- oh, shit.
shut up. shut up.
shut up. shut up.
this man has violated my rights!
who the fuck is that?
running people over is not enough
for you? now you're into kidnapping?
that man is a criminal. okay?
we busted him at the...
excuse me, i have so much brass
up my ass...
...i could be playing
"the star-spangled banner."
i ain't cut out for this, man.
come on, man. i can't do this
with you right now.
- i'm re-evaluating what's important.
- about what? being a cop?
no, about you being my partner.
is this about syd?
god! hey, marcus, man...
that was messed up, but that
ain't what this is about, mike.
once we nail tapia,
you and me, we're over.
i already signed my transfer papers.
megan, what's the name of this boy
taking you to the movies?
reggie.
daddy, please don't embarrass me
and ask him a lot of questions.
everybody knows you're a cop,
and it makes people nervous.
well, why nervous? he on crack?
- it's cool?
- yeah. come in.
what'd you...?
i got a sneak and peek.
judge sinclair said we can go
into the mortuary tonight.
we can't touch nothing,
but if we find something...
...he'll give us a righteous warrant.
you love pissing captain howard off,
don't you?
it's what i do.
so when you start playing golf?
hey, so you real serious about
this transfer thing, huh?
i mean, you been quitting for 10 years.
i just always thought it was...
...how you dealt with all this shit.

his contagiousness could touch you.
you guys have a nice evening.

- you don't smell that?
- oh, yeah, i smell it.
- it stinks.
- stop!
i'm gonna have some pepto.
- this dude hasn't been embalmed yet.
- what you talking about?
they stick a tube down your throat
and just suck out all the gunk and bile.
because what happens is, your body'll
get gaseous and you'll decompose.
don't want that to happen
before your family see you.
- i don't need to know that now.
- they sew your mouth closed.
they got to get it all out because
a lot of times dead people'll fart.
that shit'll clear a funeral home out.
- how do you know all that?
- learning channel. that shit got me.
oh, shit.
you're not even gonna
warm up to it?
hey! do some cop work.

hey, tapia, you fucking mother.
the russian grim reaper is here.

coast guard sharks and bravo team.

freeze any moving speedboat.
this is bravo.
we got a go-fast slinging a high rate
of speed down miami harbor.
stop that boat.
this guy's moving us.

coast guard, we're going in.
miami police. shut it down.
this is the police. shut it down.

vessel is dead in the water.
vessel is dead in the water.
this is what we do.
oh, man, it's full up.
it's full up.
it's a righteous bust.
how the hell they slip away?
give me the watch commander
on the horn.

on miami pd? find him.
do you know anyone
who might want to save your life?
- hello?
- marcus, they...!
you have $ 100 million of mine...
...and i want it back in 48 hours.
shit just got real.
jack snell, dea.
agent eames, fbi...
...who has just informed me...
...that satellite pinpointed tapia's jet
in cuban airspace 20 minutes ago.
cuba?
united states does not negotiate
with hostage-takers.
especially cuban hostage-takers.
it's a delicate situation.
this is not just a situation.
this is my sister.
off the record,
all state department agencies...
...are using their back-channel
contacts for a diplomatic solution.
you know, by the time
y'all finish being diplomatic...
...my sister could be in
a fucking box. this is bullshit.
he ain't getting away
from us that easy.
we ride together...
...we die together.
bad boys for life.
we just gotta do it ourselves, man.
i don't know you.
you look like you're about to do
something stupid. i'm in.
dodd tell you how
crazy us ex-delta guys are?
my brother, tito, lives in cuba.
he's a little crazy, but he's hooked up
with the underground.
weapons, men, a safe house.
whatever we need.
you can forget about passports
and all that stuff.
because if the cubans catch us,
we're all dead.
my brother tito's in alpha 66,
the anti-castro underground.
what does that have to do
with tapia?
everything. tapia's the biggest
supplier of drug cash to castro.
so alpha 66 will be all over him.
brother, that is perfect. he says he
can get men on the tunnel right away.
let me holler at him.
tito, we need layout, security,
the whole deal.
we got info that tapia's got a casket
coming in tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.
yeah, that might be our way in.
yeah.
brought you a little care package
from my friends over at the cia.
they want to help.
and don't ask me.
they're spies.
former delta intel and demo.
requesting permission to tag along.
ronnie, i hear there's a boat
on fire off the coast of cuba.
shouldn't we break
international waters to help them?
that's my dog.
point of no return.
i want to thank y'all
from the bottom of my heart.
- mike, look, i just...
- tell me when we get back.
the target's in sight. i see the boat.
roger. target 12 o'clock.
roper in the door. stand by.
go! go! go!
- tito?
- welcome to cuba.
damn. what's up with the safe house
across the street from tapia's crib?
this is the last place
anyone would look.
we've been watching the place.
guards play soccer each day at 3:30.
the bad news, everyone knows he
uses the army like his bodyguards.
- this is tapia's compound.
- cia hooked us up, huh?
yeah. this lidar laser technology
even shows his escape tunnel.
the alarm security is wired
to the army.
we're screwed if we don't blow up this
security room before we make a move.
the tunnel we're digging
branches off.
one under his back yard
and the other into his escape tunnel.
we gotta hurry up.
see? i told you my brother
was a maniac.
- how we looking?
- let me check it out.
papi, you look like jesus.
why they call this
the last supper?
it was the last time they were all
together before jesus was crucified.
crucified?
hold your ears. hey, you.
listen to me. this is fucking
depressing! you understand?!
i mean, who had this fucking idea?
i just want little angels
looking down on me.
okay, here's the ocean,
we're here. safe house.
first tunnel comes through to here.
first team takes out
the security station.
second tunnel comes through
into the center of the house.
tito, your contacts inside
said syd's in the last bedroom...
...on the second floor, right?
lupe's one of us.
if she says your sister's there...
...she is there.
three o'clock sharp, the bag of cats
and iguanas go over the fence.
hopefully the motion detectors'll go
so crazy security'll shut them off.
my guys will watch the outside
for any military.
if they come, that's bad.
let's make this count, guys.
we're in.
goddamn it, it's the fifth time today.
carlos, turn off the motion sensors
till we get it fixed.
- look what i found. can i keep them?
- no.
all right, guys...
...sensors are down. time to move.
- we are 100% go.
let's go.
left. left. yeah. there we go.
this is not as easy as it looks.
okay, we're at the t.
split right.
good luck, guys.
let's go. come on, let's go.
find the soccer game.
sniff it out, baby. sniff it out.
to the left. to the left. oh, shit.
oh, you did not see me.
- ready to bust into the escape tunnel.
- there we go. soccer.
sorry.

you supposed to shoot!

oh, i want my next partner
to shoot just like that.
it take a dysfunctional motherfucker
to bust somebody in the head like that.
that's some dysfunctional shit.
my next partner'll invite me
to his barbecues, though.
come here, girl. come here.
i came all the way to cuba for this.
come on.
y'all gotta do that
around land mines?
would you tell them that that shit is
dangerous around these land mines?
you know, mike, this ain't easy
for me, but i was wrong.
i'll be very proud for you
to date my sister.
- thanks, man.
- all right.
you know, me and syd
thought about it...
...and your behavior
was so crazy that...
...any magic we could've captured,
probably best if we didn't... you know.
you're just gonna take advantage
of my little sister?
already you breaking her heart?
- what you talking about?
- she not good enough for you?
syd, mike says you ain't shit!
now, why would you scream out
some crazy nonsense like that?
i don't appreciate you coming here,
disrespecting me in my new pool.
i bought your new pool.
why don't you hook this pool up
to your ferrari and drag it out of here?
first of all, i was joking.
and second of all, all this right here,
smell yourself right now.
because this moment is
what's wrong with you.
i got the transfer papers
in the trash can.
i'll get them and glue them
the fuck up.
- glue them up.
- what?
- want some glue?
- we won't be partners no more.
i got glue in the car.
i'm trying to talk to you. it's hot, i
feel like i'm cooking in this fucker...
...and i gotta hear shit out of you?

what you gonna do
when they come for you?
