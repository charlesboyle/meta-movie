eye and lie to me like that?
i'm sorry.
i'd rather you hit me.

hello?
speaking.
of course, sir. absolutely.
thank you very much, agent richards.
thank you, sir.
who was that?
that was the feds, my friend.
i've been informed that
i passed my urinalysis
and they would like me
to go in this morning
to start formal testing.
fuck yeah, dude.
i'll be there all day,
so take my ride, get your ass a job.
let's go.
oh, shit!
come on. get your parasitic ass in gear.
i had some twisted-ass dreams
about that dude being killed.
i slept like a baby.
i heard screaming.
what kind of tests?
psychological tests.
geez, you're a freakin' psycho, dude.
don't answer that shit honestly.
hell no.
they use the minnesota
multiphasic inventory.
it's like 600 questions,
cross-referenced
to detect deception.
they ask the same shit
six different ways. it's lame.
you'll ace it.
dude, i'm gonna pull it off.
all i needed was a shot.
gotta play the system.
like a piano.
you done with that crap, son?
yes, sir.
let's grab some coffee
while these guys finish up.
bring that with you.
i see dumb people.
we reviewed your lapd package.
since they ran your
background, physical and psych,
we're going with their paper.
navy sucks. army swallows.
took a little work to
pry your jacket loose
from their people.
they don't much like us poaching
from their applicant pool.
move it, dirt bag.
why'd they drop me?
someone here make a call?
nope.
they dropped you on psych, jim.
you blew their profiles.
we're all a little goofy here.
you'd rather be with us, wouldn't you?
absolutely, sir.
good answer.
have a seat.
said you were bilingual on your app.
they want to test your spanish.
we can get that going if you got time.
yes. sure.
who's "they"?
your fans upstairs.
fans upstairs? who?
this is some shit above my pay grade,
but some very important
people have an eye on you, jim.
westside realty management.
how may i direct your call?
please hold.
okay, mike...
alonzo?
oh, shit. joe?!
damn...! what's up, dog?
mikey, look at you. what

ocean view and all that.
you're wearing a suit now.
got your hair cut. hey, watch out, baby.
yeah. tag no more, huh?

dude, what's up with
your brother, pedro?
oh, man, he's in iraq.
he's in a forward unit.
get the fuck out of here. yeah.
fuckin' mexicans.
bye, sweetie.
thank you, sir. i need
me some of this, man.
i've been taking piss all day.
dude!
what?
you're not going to
fucking believe this. what?
i had an interview today. yeah?
remember crazy joe? yeah, yeah, yeah.
dude stomped that guy's
face in at taco land
for grabbing his chick's ass.
homeboy got his shit together, man.
went to ucla.
works at this office up in century city.
i got the hookup, dog.
that's a lot of lettuce. that's right.
and in three months, i get benefits.
damn! benefits?
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. shit!
yeah!
it's not for sure yet, though, dude.
i still got to meet the owner, right.
but he says i'm straight.
it's all good, you know.
you're in. dude...
i'm in. oh, shit.
yeah... what happened?
they want my ass, man.
going back tomorrow
for a polygraph test.
if i pass that, they'll
send me to georgia next week.
oh...! damn! it's like that?!
what's up, lawman?
whoo-hoo!
how you gonna pass a lie detector test,
you lying motherfucker? aw, easy, man.
after every question,
you just fucking squeeze
like you're taking a
dump, you know, man.
it throws the machine off. ooh! oh, dog.
you're gonna shit your
pants like that, bro.
fuck, i think i just did.
all right, jim,
i'm going to ask you
some control questions
before we get to the good stuff.
they can be answered just "yes" or "no."
just relax and respond naturally.
are you ready?
yes, sir.
you can just answer "yes" or "no."
"is your name jim luther davis?"
yes.
"do you live in los angeles?"
yes.
"are you 26 years old?"
yes.
"are you married?"
no.
"are you wearing shoes?"
yes.
"have you ever smoked marijuana?"
yes.
"aside from the occasion you
mentioned in your application?"
no.
jim, knock it off.
what, sir?
son, i've been doing
polygraph examinations
since you were swimming
in your daddy's balls.
so i know all the tricks.
you've either got a tack in your shoe
or you're clinching your butt.
i've got spikes all over this thing.
if you do it again,
i'm going to void this test
and report that you were uncooperative.
do you understand?
yes, sir.
walk with me.
we've got a problem, jim.
with what?
with your candor.
come in.
he's here, sir.
bring him in.
jim, this is mr. hollenbeck,
our regional director.
pleased to meet you, sir.
have a seat.
mr. gillespie.
pleased to meet you, sir.
jim, uh...
you're an exemplary candidate
with valuable operational experience.
you've cleared the psych
and physical hurdles.
your credit's good, you've
kept your nose clean,
you've got the spanish.
you clearance is still valid.
everybody we talked to for background
had only great things to say about you.
and then you scored a
negative-five on the polygraph.
that's indicative of deception.
we were wondering why
until we got the results of urinalysis.
we detected thc metabolites
in the urine, jim.
levels were just below
the positive threshold,
but there was a presence.
do you have a drug problem, mr. davis?
i don't have a drug problem, sir.
i made a very stupid mistake.
would you care to tell
us the circumstances
of your stupid mistake?
i was at a party...
and someone offered me a joint.
i was pretty angry
about not getting into
the lapd, so i was
feeling rebellious and, uh
i inhaled.
someone considering a
career in law enforcement
would be well advised to exercise
a little more discipline.
yes, sir.
i'm on the fence, doug.
it's your call.
mr. davis, i'm in charge
of several programs.
yes, sir?
had a nice chat with your
old commanding officer.
good.
recognize these guys?
huh? yeah,
they're your buddies.
your old hajji buddies.
you should work in a deli
how you sliced these guys up.
jesus christ.
oh, i'm sorry.
did i ruin your lunch?
you went through those sons of bitches
like butter.
i took my objective
and did what was necessary
to obtain information
vital to national security
that saved american lives.
whacked them all, huh, jim?
my c.o. told me not to
leave anything breathing.
i do what i'm told. relax, son.
you were getting paid to fuck people up.
you know we're beefing up
our anti-narcotics programs
in latin america.
yes, sir.
i had heard some
things on the grapevine.
i want you on my team.
i need someone who can get things done
on my task force in colombia.
sir...
i listed los angeles and
san diego on my dream sheet.
no slots in southern california?
no, jim.
i got colombia.
that's what i have for you.
if it's not what you want,
thank you for your time.
you can hit the door.
what exactly would i be doing?
running and gunning in the jungle?
mr. davis, this is the deal.
you'll be riding shotgun with the locals
as interpreter-advisor
on sharp end operations.
you'll be in some very hot areas.
how hot?
we talking trigger time?
sure, if you want.
well, who exactly
would i be working for?
the u.s. government, jim.
i want you in glynco, georgia next week.
you make it through in one piece,
you'll be working colombia's
finest by the summer.
it's just that...
i'm supposed to get married, sir.
maybe now is not the
time to start a family.
we've been together a long time.
i'm serious about marrying her.
foreign bride could jeopardize
your security clearance.
jim, don't shack up with some mexican.
colombian broads are
smoking hot and knee deep.
you get a per diem and a driver.
you'll live like a
fucking king down there.
yes, sir, i understand.
you take some time,
think about what you want to do.
this is a serious commitment.
i want the opportunity, sir.
i want on board.
welcome aboard.
i'm taking a big chance on you.
thank you, sir.
this is the career i've dreamed of.
these are your orders,
orientation material and travel money.

end of working hours wednesday.
thank you, sir.
