don't be daft. you need
something solid to plow a field.
yeah, but he's something else, that one.
all right, ladies and gentlemen,
settle down, settle down.
horses on my right,
men with money in their pockets
on my left.

good. more money than sense.
- dave hill!
- i'm here, yes!
bugger off, you tight bastard.
you've been coming here for 20 years,

as a pork scratching!

first up today, a gorgeous young horse.
prettiest young thing i've seen
since my wife on our wedding day.
let's get going, shall we?
who wants this wonderful creature?
one guinea!
one guinea. one guinea.
i thought you needed a plow horse,
mr. narracott.
one guinea.
any advance on one guinea?
- two guineas!
- two guineas.
- three.
- three guineas.
ted narracott,
it's completely the wrong animal.
si easton, i'm not gonna let
that bastard see me off.
- five guineas!
- five guineas!
- six!
- oh, for the love of...
- seven!
- seven guineas.
greedy sod.
thinks he can just buy anybody. eight!
stop it. he's your landlord.
you can't be picking fights with him.
- ten guineas!
- ten guineas.
you haven't got the money.
let's go home, let's have a pint.
eleven guineas, sir! from as good
a man <i>as</i> any in this town!
do i hear 12 guineas? twelve guineas.
that's top price for a working animal.
ted, save it for the shire!
there are big days and
there are small days. which will it be?
do i hear any advance on 11 guineas?
just let him go, dad.
i don't care for him. he's too jumpy.
shall we say 25?
- twenty-five guineas.
- he's got you there. nice try, ted.
you were great, mr. n.
- gave him a run for his money.
- going, going...
- thirty!
thirty guineas!
thirty guineas.
thirty guineas.
going.
going.
gone! to mr. ted narracott!
what have you done, ted?
what have you done?
here you are, ted.
quite a beast there. what are you
gonna do with him on a working farm?
i hope you got the rent, ted.
i'll be around for it when it comes due.
you're a fool, ted.
and now rosie will never forgive you.
- what have you done?
- that's mooney's colt.
you were supposed to buy
a plow horse!
you bought him?
what'd you pay for him?
how much, ted narracott?
i won't tell you a lie,
though i would love to.
thirty guineas!
thirty guineas?
he's not worth 10! are you
out of your mind? what about the rent?
he's a strong one, rosie.
look at the way he holds his head.
how the hell are we gonna
pull anything with that'?
ted, you have to take him back.
you have to take him back right now.
you have to get down on your knees
and beg for our money back.
no. no, please, don't take him back.
we can't take him back
until he's broken in.
and how are you gonna train
a horse with that leg?
i'll train him.
you stay out of this, albert.
you don't know nothing about horses.
please, mum. please, let me. i can do it.
we have to keep him. no choice.
right. well, you got one month
to break him in,
or i'm taking him back myself.
how'd you get to 30?
what other fool bid you up that high?
it was lyons.
we're going to lose everything.
after all we've been through,
we're going to lose it all.
don't worry, mum. i'll raise him.
i'll raise him good.
well, you better. go on, get started!
see if a child can undo what your fool
of a father's done to this family of ours.
easy, boy. easy. easy.
right.
let's make a start then.
it's oats.
very tasty, that is.
it's beef and gravy to us.
come on.
i'll bet you're missing your mother.
look at you.
first time without your mum.
first time away from home.
but you're not alone, are you?
in fact.
'cause i'm here.
it's all right.
all right.
i'm going to call you joey.
you understand?
joey. that's you.
and i'm albert.
it's all right. you're mine now.
you're mine.
good boy. good boy.
good boy. come on.
whoa.
i want you to stay there, joey.
stay.
that's it.
good boy. that's it, you got it.
hey, look at him, albie!
he's playing grandma's footsteps!
all right. come on, joey. back you go.
come on.
come on. back you go. you're all right.
that's it. good boy. all right.
you got to stay there. you understand?
that's it. good boy. good boy.
you've got it. good boy.
good boy.
good.
now call him. whistle.
come now, joey.
come on.
you can come now, joey.
- i don't think he fancies your owls.
- i read it in a story.
it's how the indians
used to summon their horses.
now, joey, when i whistle,
you've got to come. understand?
my dad had a dog
who stayed when you called him.
he used to run up behind you
when you weren't looking, and...
he's not a dog.
he's just puzzling it through.
will you look at you!
albie!
there's only 15 here.
the rest will come.
you know by rights i could
take this farm back today, don't you?
and i'm a great believer in my rights.
it will come.
if you drank less beer
and bought fewer horses,
you might be able to
look your landlord in the eye, narracott.
i said i'll pay you.
we're going to plant the bottom field.
the bottom field's rock hard.
only stones down there.
no. we're going to plow it.
just give me till the autumn. i'll pay
every penny i owe you, with interest.
how are you going to plow it?
not with that fancy animal of yours.
he'll do it.
you'll not get that one in a harness,
let alone pulling a plow,
even drunk on a tuesday night.
you know that.
and i can't wait for the money,
there's a war coming.
i promise you that field will be plowed.
we'll plant it with turnips.
the money will be yours
when harvest comes.
please, sir. please.
very well.
if that fancy plows that field,
i'll give you till october
to set things straight.
what if he doesn't?
i'll take the horse on the day he fails.
and i'll take your father's farm,
and give it to working men who can
hold their pints and hold their heads
high in decent company.
no, please. sir, you can't do that.
now, now, lad. what?
are you bladdered as well?
ted narracott,
i've got you down in my book.
- you can't harness him.
- he's got to be collared.
you're scaring him, dad!
you're scaring him.
- he can't take a plow!
- he's got to plow!
he won't be able to do it!
he's too young.
he's not even been backed yet!
ted!
it's all right, boy. it's all right.
it's all right. it's all right.
i knew this would happen
<i>as</i> soon as i laid eyes on him.
ted, no.
ted, no!
he's worth nothing to me.
if he won't take the collar,
he's not worth a damn thing!
- dad?
- move aside.
dad, stop!
you shoot that horse, we have nothing.
no!
you were right what you said, dad.
he'll do it.
you told lyons he'll plow that field,
and he will.
you'll see.
he'll show you.
we'll show you.
we'll get it done.
let go.
let go.
go back to the house.
some days are best forgotten.
today ain't one of them. come on.
how are you today, joey?
i don't know much about life, boy,
but i do know that there are big days
and there are small days.
most days are small days, and, well,
they don't matter much to anyone.
but this...
well, this is a big one.
this is our big day!
it's cold out there,
so i'm going to take this off.
if it's tough for you,
it should be tough for me, too.
now, i'm going to teach you
how to plow.
and you're going to learn.
is that understood?
then we can be together, which is
how i believe things are meant to be.
steady, boy.
here we go. here we go. come on.
come on. come on.
now, boy. easy. easy.
look at me, joey.
see?
see?
you just got to put your nose through.
that's it.
see, you've got it. you've got it.
good boy.
there.
too large, too rocky,
matted with grass roots.
even a sturdy plow horse
would never manage it alone.
yet he will, i say.
you'd swear he'd sprout wings and fly
if albert told you so.
it's a fine thing, loyal to your mate,
even if he is a bit barmy.
a team of two might manage,
given a month and good weather.
ted too squeamish to watch, is he?
of course he's watching.
come on.
come on.
well, you've raised him up
a true narracott, ted.
picture of his father, he is.
not a dollop of ordinary sense,
but that thick stubbornness
that'll lead him to insist
on the impossible.
wasn't a farmer in devon
didn't admire you, myself among them,
leaving your brothers that fine farm
and setting yourself at this stony patch
of unpromising ground.
you've fettle enough for 20 men.
but with a gimpy leg and the drinking...
for the pain, isn't it, that you drink?
none of us could have anticipated
an ending better than this.
makes me question
the wisdom of the charity
that urged me to rent you this place,
not only looking at you, me old pal,
but that pretty little wife of yours.
thought you were a spark, she did!
and now your son's sinking into
the selfsame bog that's swallowing you.
see, joey?
i got the collar, too!
okay, come on, boy.
walk on. that's it.
walk on!
walk on, joey.
come on, boy, walk on!
you'd be better off standing at the top
of the hill and going down!
gravity's the only friend
you're gonna have today, young lad!
walk on, joey! walk on!
come on, joey, walk on.
walk on, boy.
walk on. come on, walk on.
it'll take the whip to move him.
bravo! you reached the top of the hill!
off you go again, boy!
you'll make even better time
coming down!
that's the way. now, come on,
keep straight, boy. good boy.
keep straight. good lad. good lad.
now walk on. good boy.
good boy. now come on, dig in!
albie, we're all with you!
come on, keep it straight, boy.
that's it, walk on. walk on.
- look, look, the plow hasn't even cut yet.
do you know,
i believe we can do it, joey.
i knew when i first saw you
that you'd be the best of us.
that's why he bought you.
he knows you have all the courage
he never had.
i knew when i first saw you
that you'd be the one who'd save us!
whoa.
you've got no chance, lad.
he'll not turn over half an acre.
give it up now.
you've done well. you've tried hard.
you're more of a man than your father.
come on now, mr. lyons,
that's a bit rough, isn't it'?
well, he'll destroy that horse.
i'll be over thursday.
give you a day to close it up.
your wool.
i'm sorry, rosie.
now, boy!
you've got to do it, joey!
you don't know, so i'm going to
have to do the knowing for you.
the rest of our lives depend on this!
so get set to pull! and pull straight!
and pull hard!
now, boy! go!
walk on, joey, walk on! whoa! that's it!
good boy, joey! good boy!
walk on! walk on! walk on!
walk on, joey!
go on, walk on! that's it.
walk on. walk on.
go around it!
whoa, joey!
whoa. joey! joey!
joey! whoa! whoa!
joey, stop, you'll break the blade!
will you look at you!
mum, dad! come and look!
he's doing it!
good lad, albie!
albert, well done!
i wouldn't have believed it!
i'd not let a child of mine slip in the mud
alongside a plow blade.
he could lose a foot.
you'll likelier lose an eye, mr. lyons,
if you carry on prating at me
how to manage my son!
or my plow, or my horse, or my field,
or my farm!
come on, albie! push on through!
get it done, albie! get it done.
albie, are you all right?
are you all right?
up you get.
my pair of fools. my mighty fools.
you're as battered
and bloodied as he is.
- where's dad?
- still in the bottom field.
stumbling about, i suppose.
it's not the drink, albert,
that makes him stumble.
he drinks, mum!
so might you if you'd been
where he's been, seen what he's seen.
he don't talk to me about it.
he don't talk about it 'cause he can't.
there aren't words for some things.
come here.
the mice have been at it.
sit down.
here.
it's his campaign pennant.
he were sergeant, 7th battalion,
imperial yeomanry.
and that is
the queen's south africa medal.
every man who fought in the boer war
got one of those.
and this...
that's the
distinguished conduct medal.
- not dad's?
- well, it isn't mine, dear.
he got that
after the fighting at transvaal.
after he'd been hurt
and he'd saved some other lads,
and, well, i don't know what else.
he won't tell me, either.
but the first day he got home
he just tossed them out.
first day he could walk,
he threw them straight in the dustbin
and wouldn't hear a word i said not to.
see, what you done today,
you and joey, you're chuffed up now,
and so you should be, my splendid boy.
it's good to be proud
when you've done something good.
but what he done in africa,
whatever it was, he takes no pride in it.
hard as it surely was
and however much pain it's cost him,
he refuses to be proud of killing,
i suppose.
i'd be proud.
if i'd gone off to war,
if i'd gone and saved my mates...
whether or not you think
you'd do the same thing as him,
think how brave he is
for refusing to be proud.
your dad makes mistakes,
and he drinks to forget
the mistakes that he's made,
but he never gave up.
and he does that for us.
and today, you showed the world
it's all been worth it.
you keep looking after joey,
and he'll always be looking after you.
"sergeant, 7th battalion,
imperial yeomanry."
you see this, joey?
it's been through an entire war.
i'm not stealing it.
i'll give it back to him someday.
um...
i'm the only boy that drives in
the village. no one else drives but me.
that's right, and this is my dad's car.
- you're lucky that you're in it.
- your dad's car.
i'm not normally allowed to drive it
'cause it's so...
is he a friend of yours?
come on, boy.
let's show her how to fly!
- ahhh!
- oh!
well, you're clearly not going to be
a jumper.
shoo, harold!
we can try planting something else.
or we could hire ourselves out
to uncle bob.
how else are
we gonna pay mr. lyons' rent?
what are we going to do?
i used to believe that god
gave each man
his fair portion of bad luck.
i don't feel that any more.
i've had more than my share.
you'll stop loving me, rose,
and i won't blame you when you do.
well, i might hate you more,
but i'll never love you less.
it's war!
we are at war with germany!
you hear?
england is at war with germany!
they're going to ring the bells at 6:00,
and then never ring them again
until the war is over.
look smart, joey lad!
it's the tavistock fair!
what has he done with him?
first name, middle name, last. sign.
last name first.
first name, middle name, last.
take my word for it,
finest horse in the parish.
goes like a racer,
strong, decent, very fine.
no curbs, no splints. good feet and teeth.
he's <i>as</i> sound as a bell, sir.
and how much are you charging, sir,
for this strong, decent,
and very fine animal?
forty.
i'll give you 20 and not a penny more.
twenty's no good to me, captain.
thirty-five and he's yours.
i don't even know how he rides.
oh, he rides. splendidly.
you'll be astonished, i promise you that.
finest horse in all of devon.
finest horse i've ever seen.
thank you.
you can't.
you can't. he's mine.
- i trained him.
- albert.
you can't have him. he's my horse, sir.
i'm afraid it's too late, lad.
i've just paid 30 guineas for him.
please. i'll get you money.
i will, i'll get you money.
i'll work for it.
i'll work for it.
he won't obey anyone else.
he won't be any good in the war neither.
he shies at every sound.
i'm sorry.
well, if joey's going, i'm going, too.
i'm volunteering.
- i see. what's your name, lad?
- albert, sir.
- and how old are you, albert?
- nineteen, sir.
- is that the truth?
- no, sir, but i look 19
and i'm bigger than most 19-year-olds,
and i'm strong, sir,
and i'm not afraid of anything.
i don't doubt your qualifications, albert,
but the law is very clear
about the proper age for soldiering.
your father's done what he had to do,
you know that.
thirty guineas isn't nearly enough
to purchase a horse
as fine as your joey, i know that.
but it's all i've got.
will you lease him to me, albert?
to be my own mount?
i promise you, man to man,
that i'll look after him
as closely as you've done.
i'll respect him and all the care
that you've taken with him.
and if i can, i'll return him to your care.
now say goodbye.
it's all right.
all right, turn it in. that's enough.
he's a horse, not a dog.
now on your way. come on!
do you want to lose the farm? rose?
it's the way you did it.
but we're at war.
aren't we just?
joey.
i told you, sling your hook!
let him be, perkins.
this isn't the end.
this isn't the end, my brother.
i, albert narracott, solemnly swear
we will be together again.
wherever you are, i will find you,
and i will bring you home.
steady, steady. steady now, come on!
walk on! walk on, come on! get on!
- take good care of him.
- yes, sir. i will.
whoa, whoa, whoa! easy. easy.
easy.
whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa!
steady, steady. whoa, whoa, joey!
stop mucking about, you hear?
you're in the army now, son.
good boy. good boy. steady.
steady, steady. come on.
easy, come on.
come on, around. good boy.
relax.
easy, easy, back up!
joey, meet topthorn.
topthorn, this is joey.
sort out who's in charge
between the two of you. do you hear?
if you want to fight, get it over with
'cause once we're over there,
you're going to need
everything you've got for fritz.
gently, perkins.
i don't want to sour him.
there'll be nothing gentle
about the war, sir.
and there'll be nothing gentle
about this one, either.
i understand that, sergeant,
but i want him fit and shining.
he's my horse.
sir.
easy, boy.
scares the living daylights out of me.
- who?
- perkins. glad he's on our side.
not bad. not bad at all.
still, not a patch on my topthorn.
i wouldn't be so sure.
i think he's got potential.
he's certainly got the bit
between his teeth.
i actually think my blenheim's faster
than the pair of them.
clear off.
all right, gentlemen, listen here.
everything tells us the same story,
from waterloo to omdurman,
from pickett's charge
to the battle of mars-la-tour.
the first attack can and should be
the decisive one. perkins?
- yes, sir.
- no excuses, no mistakes.
every horse groomed
and fit for presentation.
- i want a full practice charge tomorrow.
- sir.
i thought you two had bottled out.
as if.
all right, then. let's see what
you two jokers are made of, shall we?
this is what quiet confidence looks like.
i'll wait for you two at the duke of york.
over to you, captain nicholls.
draw swords!
give point!
charge!
come on, joey, i know you've got it.
come on, boy!
come on, boy!
- whoa! whoa!
nice of you to turn up.
he's got speed, i'll give him that.
but has he got stamina?
he has everything.
what are you up to?
i'm writing a letter.
with a picture in it?
it's to the boy who owned joey.
i want to show him
how wonderful he's looking.
before we take him across the channel
to face a million german guns.
yes, before that.
traveling with the dragoon guards
and the royals. transport detachment.
they need to be at the dock
at 5:00 a.m. to check all the kit.
battle orders, no polishing.
buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup irons,
let them all go dull.
i don't want anything to flash in the sun
and give us away.
of course.
- charlie.
- jamie.
charlie.
what do you think of the new cap?
silk lining. i quite like it.
i'm not sure it's going to make
a lot of difference to the germans.
oh, i don't know about that.
think about it.
you're a boche, just working out
which of two chaps to shoot,
and you thought, "good lord",
one of them really is wearing
a very stylish cap indeed!."
you might shoot the other one instead.
or alternatively think, "i fancy that cap,"
and kill you first of all.
hadn't thought of that.
that is our target,
the german 11th division,
at the moment bivouacked three miles
to the east of the menin road.
we have been watching them,
and they have pitched tents
for the night and lit cooking fires.
knock them out and we could slide in
behind the german lines
and come at them from the south
at geluveld.
excellent.
- numbers?
- about 600, infantry.
twice our size.
regiments of horse and men,
the advantage is ours.
and we have surprise on our side.
but the sooner we move, the better.
we have no assurance
they'll still be there tomorrow morning.
right. good.
so today it is. charlie, tell the men.
- salisbury formation?
- salisbury formation.
charge through them
and secure the ground behind.
the grass to the left is taller
than we are, it's perfect cover.
excellent work, sergeant major.
time spent
on reconnaissance is rarely wasted.
thank you, singh.
jamie!
they have no idea we're coming.
not having scruples, are you, jim?
no, i understand
the surprise is everything.
but if it must be done,
let's do it quickly.
you all right, charlie?
never been better.
literally. never better.
prepare to mount! mount!
prepare to mount!
mount!
thank you, stanley.
hey, joey.
my bonny boy.
you're all right, aren't you, joey?
eh?
gentlemen, it is an honor
to ride beside you.
make the kaiser rue the day
he dared to cross swords with us.
let every man make himself,
his king, his country,
and his fallen comrades proud.
be brave.
fear god! honor the king!
fear god! honor the king!
draw swords!
good luck, my friends.
forward, to walk!
walk, march!
forward, to canter!
canter, march!
<i>kavallerie!</i>
charge!
burn the documents!
pull him down!
what? did you think that a garrison
on open ground would go undefended?
look at yourself!
who do you think you are?
- now come!
- what do we do with the horses?
- if they're injured, shoot them.
and the others, sir?
the others you round up and take
to base camp. they will pull guns.
you'll never get fancy horses like these
to pull guns.
- then shoot them also!
- sir?
perhaps we could use some of them
with the ambulances,
to get the injured men off the field.
- will they take the harness?
- i'd like to try, sir.
it won't work. they're cavalry.
- let's try.
- you won't get the harness on.
come on, michael. whoa. whoa.
easy now.
easy now, englishman. easy.
whoa. whoa. whoa.
easy. easy. easy.
easy now.
whoa.
gunther.
it's hopeless. we can't help them.
well, well, look at you.
whoever taught you this
has just saved your life.
hello, the farm!
hello, si easton.
i was at the post office.
and while i was there, mrs. allen said
a parcel had come for albert from the...
from the...
from over there. and i thought
i could go up that way in the morning,
and here it is.
who'd be sending me a parcel
over there?
well, open it and see.
it's a sketchbook.
it's captain nicholls' sketchbook!
see that? that's a picture of joey!
it's a picture of joey.
well, i never!
and there's a letter.
well, go on then, go on.
"dear albert narracott,
captain nicholls, who died..."
"captain nicholls, who died in action
today, left you this."
"yours, sergeant sam perkins."
you weren't to know it was bad news.
he was riding joey when he died.
- you don't know that he was riding him.
- "in action," it says.
gentlemen!
we move forward
to the front line tonight.
full marching orders.
get moving!
schroeder!
no, not you. you. come.
i'm keeping you here.
you're best with the horses,
and we need to move the camp quickly
if the enemy continues
to push through from the west.
- they're pushing through?
- i'm told.
we will move later, when we find
where the horses are needed most.
yes, sir. perhaps i can keep
my brother here with me.
he's also very good with horses.
no. not necessary.
get moving, we leave tonight.
it's all right, gunther.
you are not going.
i'll tell them you're only 14.
that you're a boy.
father signed me in. he knew my age.
and so do they.
mother obviously never told you
how to fold a shirt.
of course she did. i just wasn't listening.
but you need to listen now.
i promised her.
i made her a solemn promise
that you would be safe with me.
with me, michael.
they'll never make a head count.
there are too many of us.
you can stay here.
slip underneath the bed,
until they move out.
then what?
gunther, it will be fine.
and when all the machines break down
and they call up the horses,
i'll see you at the front.
we'll be together again.
gunther.
i'm giving this to you.
for luck.
to keep you safe.
ah!
get back in line!
i'm hungry. did you bring food?
i'm sorry.
- will father be ashamed?
- he will pretend to be.
maybe at first he will be.
but in the end, he will be glad.
and us?
what about us?
i was ready to go.
i was proud to go.
i wanted to go.
the food in italy is good.
yes.
and what about the women?
not <i>as</i> good as the food.
because they've eaten
too much of the food?
you are too young for war
and you're too young for women!
i don't feel so young.
- not any more.
- michael.
- what?
- go to sleep.
we have a big night of riding ahead.
good night, michael.
night-night, gunther.
- schroeder.
- yes, sir.
a mistake?
a promise.
<i>ja.</i>
<i>grand-père.</i>
it's closer today.
the wind plays tricks with the noise.
it's moving away from us.
i can hear it, grand-père.
and there is no wind.
you shouldn't lie to me.
here. there is no wind here.
but over there, the wind is so strong
it will lift you off the ground.
you lie about everything!
you say you aren't worried,
but it's clear you are.
i know the war is approaching,
but you say,
"oh, it's just a trick of the wind."
did i say that?
you started lying
when mama and papa went away.
they're dead.
but you won't say so.
do you think i'll die
if you tell me the truth?
the truth is
you should speak to your elders
with respect.
if you tell me the truth about the war,
i will tell you the truth
about the big horses
i've been keeping in the windmill.
now who is the one telling lies?
in the windmill?
yes. they were standing in the windmill
waiting for don quixote.
this is françois and this is claude.
i named them after two boys
who broke my heart last summer.
they must belong to someone.
horses like this don't just appear
from a fairy tale.
yes, i know, grand-pére.
they are not unicorns.
- now, emilie...
- so i will be fair and wait one day,
and if no one comes to get them
by night-time,
then they belong to me.
emilie, look at me.
you cannot ride.
mother used to tell me
how my bones would give way
- with the slightest bump or fall.
- yes. that's right. so, it is settled?
good girl.
it will only be settled
when i decide which one to ride first.
over my dead body!
at least i won't have long to wait!
i was in love with a boy called françois,
who had your lovely eyes.
unfortunately, he was in love with a girl
called marie, who had your teeth.
she fell for a boy called claude,
who broke my heart
and who i intend to marry one day.
eyes on me.
no talking.
today, we learn to jump.
did you know the french cleared
the 1.85 meter at the paris olympics
to win the gold medal?
today, we will beat that record.
this is your jump.
when i call you,
be very brave and leap over it!
leap over it!
watch me.
and now it's your...
he doesn't think we can do it.
but we will show him, won't we?
no need to be afraid.
you are very tall.
you'll kill yourself.
only if you get in my way
to make me fall.
oh, please. come off the...
find somewhere to hide them.
and do it quickly.
my name is bonnard. this is my land.
why are you here?
food. for the soldiers at the front.
everyone must give their share.
they are taking everything.
where are the horses?
what horses?
- what is it?
- leave it if you don't know what it's for.
a pot is a pot. we'll find some use for it.
sir.
- where's the livestock?
- i make jam. we have no animals.
but there's fresh hay in your barn.
we use it
to replace the mattress stuffings.
- her grandfather?
- yes.
- where are her parents?
- they're dead.
they died.
what is that?
the wind. it plays tricks in the attic.
there is no wind.
an old house creaks.
go, close the shutters.
she's sickly, no?
if you or any of your friends harm her,
as old as i am, i will kill you.
you know,
i was going to give you back your pot.
but now i'm going to keep it.
for soup.
we will be back.
in the new season.
tell me what happened to them.
to my mother and father.
you said you would tell me
how they died
on my birthday.
and tomorrow's my birthday.
they died fighting.
didn't they?
but when the soldiers come,
you do nothing.
- you are a coward, aren't you?
- yes.
it was your parents who were brave.
i make jams.
and you've never done a brave thing
in your life?
maybe there are different ways
to be brave.
did you know the french
have the best carrier pigeons?
and this could be the difference
in the war,
our messages getting through.
i don't want to hear about the birds.
they are released at the front
and told to go home.
this is all they know.
but to get there,
they must fly over a war.
can you imagine such a thing?
here you are flying over
so much pain and terror,
and you know you can never look down.
you have to look forward,
or you'll never get home.
i ask you,
what could be braver than that?
- what is that?
- a present.
i hope you have not bought me
a disgusting dress
that i then have to wear, like last year.
it was disgusting?
- yes.
i looked like an ugly nun.
give me your hand.
grand-pére, we have no money!
when the war is over, then you can
buy me jewels and carriages.
anything you say, my sweet one.
anything you say.
you are, of course, the boss.
it's just an old thing i found.
don't worry yourself. leave it.
i'll put it back.
it was your mother's.
i hid it so <i>as</i> not to encourage you.
emilie, i want you to ride very slowly.
very carefully.
- and promise me you won't go far.
- of course.
to the top of the hill
and straight back again.
i promise.
my hero!
slowly. slowly.
emilie!
emilie!
- let go of me! no!
- she is my granddaughter!
- françois!
- emilie, stop! don't hurt her, please!
- don't hurt her.
- no!
you don't need them.
there are so many others!
please, take the bigger one
and leave the smaller one.
you are breaking
my granddaughter's heart.
the war has taken everything
from everyone.
- what will happen to them'?
- they will pull artillery until they die.
or until the war is over.
it will never be over!
you have your answer then.
heiglemann.
- these are yours.
- yes, sir.
they look strong.
should last a month or two.
you're beautiful.
it's a pity they found you.
such a pity.
pull together, men!
pull together!
together, men! together!
put your backs into it!
steady pace! steady pace!
- watch out, number three's slacking!
- move it, move it!
halt! halt! break!
break! stop! stop!
heiglemann! bring out another one!
heiglemann, bring up another horse!
that one!
no, no! the big black one!
he's a good horse, sir.
but if you move him up to
the heavy gun, he will be no use at all.
prince is already losing condition.
his leg, sir.
- you have given them names?
- yes, sir.
you should never give a name
to anything you are certain to lose.
but his leg is not good enough, sir.
private, you will do
<i>as</i> you are told.
hook him up!
can't you see, sir? this one is stronger.
hook him up!
no slacking!
keep it taut! use your whip!
no slacking! to the top!
halt!
take the horses away.
shell!
and load!
back!
case!
position!
officer 22 and
fire!
valuables in the bucket, lads!
if you live, you'll get them back!
if you live, you get them back.
good luck!
valuables in the bucket!
the blood of christ
keep thee in eternal life.
in the name of the father
and of the son...
maybe it's a drill, albie.
maybe it's a drill, like last time.
love letter?
well, that's my business.
i hear you and your mate
were doing bird imitations again.
are you going to write a letter
to your horse?
after you find your horse,
i've lost my needle in a haystack
and i could use some help.
anything valuable!
anyone who comes back
gets to share it out!
stay here.
remember that day me and joey
raced you in your car?
i remember you somersaulting
through the air.
who was that girl you were with?
there was a girl?
there was. don't you remember?
it was just some girl, i suppose.
i don't recall which one.
i do remember you
falling on your bum in a ditch.
you see?
always entertaining, narracott.
i'll give you that.
you did that? you fell on your bum?
into position! everyone ready!
- there she goes!
- into position! let's go!
- go! choke on it!
- yes, sarge!
be brave, boys! be ready! be ready!
let's go, men, get ready to go!
hold your nerve, boys!
remember, it's not too far to go,
there's a way through!
run fast, keep your wits about you,
keep your eyes open,
and god and the king
will keep an eye on you.
company will fix bayonets!
fix bayonets!
you know what it reminds me of
out there?
- what?
- that bloody impossible lower field
the day me and joey plowed it.
best day of my life, that was,
and you were there.
and this here is the worst day of my life
about to begin,
and you're here cheering me on.
us two, always!
and him.
once you're in no man's land,
go to the flank,
- stay on the flank.
- yes, sir.
- come on, boys, to the ladders!
- stick close to the gentry, yeah?
that's our ticket. we have the pluck,
but they have the luck.
come on, boys, keep going.
keep going.
andrew.
you, too, narracott.
and you, too.
come on. on your ladders, boys!
on your ladders.
in you go! in you go! that's it!
listen to your sergeant!
if anybody turns back,
if any one of our boys
comes running towards you,
you take this rifle
and you shoot them dead!
- do you understand?
- yes, sir!
do you understand me? do you
understand what i'm telling you, son?
you take this rifle
and you shoot them dead.
you understand?
up there, son. up your ladder!
up your ladder to your work!
it's good. andrew, it's good.
andrew!
nobody's retreating today.
andrew! andrew,
nobody is retreating today!
ready to go over the top!
just leave me! leave me!
you'll be all right here. you'll be safe.
someone will come for you.
albert.
- albert, listen.
- it's all right.
it's all right. we're devon boys. yeah?
yeah.
get down!
no!
albie.
we made it.
we made it.
andrew! this way out!
gas, gas, gas!
albie.
there's no stopping here.
keep them moving!
but, sir, there's something wrong.
this one needs to rest.
there's no rest for them.
move them along! move them along!
please, please, please.
stay on your feet. no, please!
no, no, no.
no. please.
please. stay on your feet.
come on, come on. please.
no, please. stay on your feet. come on.
they're coming. leave it, private!
leave it!
come with me.
go to hell!
run!
run! run!
run!
run!
<i>stand to, stand to.</i>
there's something moving.
what the hell is it?
it looks like a cow.
what the hell would a cow
be doing up there?
that definitely isn't a cow.
well, what is it?
it can't be a horse.
nothing alive could be out there.
it isn't a horse. it isn't a horse!
yes, it's a horse.
- it's a horse.
- yeah, it's a horse.
well, bugger me.
it's a horse!
lads, we should call him.
how do you call a horse?
he's caught on the wire.
oh, sod it.
what do you think you're doing?
get back, do you hear me?
corporal, that's an order. get back!
listen to him, sir. we can't leave him.
what's he doing?
it's a trap.
no, i don't think so.
i think he's trying to help.
scare him back into his hole.
it's a white flag, isn't it?
you see the white flag?
i'm just after tending to this here horse
is all!
get back, you stupid git!
"the lord is my shepherd.
i shall not want."
"he leadeth me into green pastures."
"he leadeth me down
beside still waters."
poor beastie.
poor babbie.
it's all right.
it's all right, don't buck and wriggle so.
you're only shredding yourself.
you'll blind yourself.
bugger me worthless. i didn't think to
bring gloves or something to cut the...
- ow!
i thought perhaps
you might need these.
for the barbed wire.
- yeah.
- yeah, i...
thanks.
cheers.
cheers.
thanks.
that's a very long strand.
and when you cut it, it's going to release
this, and this, and this.
and they'll coil back rather violently,
which, i'm afraid, will only wound
the poor fellow further.
you speak good english.
i speak english well.
may i?
what if we cut his head free first,
so he won't try to stand up
and blind himself?
- and then...
- pity you didn't bring a second pair.
then i could cut the wire here.
we need more wire cutters!
his blind spot.
the cutters won't frighten him.
if you could cut here, holding this wire,
- i could...
- say no more. i'm right behind you.
and you understand what's happening,
do you not, o best beloved'?
and you must lay so very nice and still.
there's a lad.
a remarkable horse, you are,
helping us help you.
there's a lad.
there's a remarkable lad.
so, how's things in yonder trench?
delightful.
we read, we knit sweaters, and we
train our rats to perform circus tricks.
if you ever need any more rats,
we can always send ours over
'cause we've more than we need,
strictly speaking.
besides, they scare off
all the pretty girls.
our girls aren't afraid of rats.
big strapping german girls, eh?
kind what give robust massages?
every thursday.
and they bring rum cake
on your birthday.
okay. all right.
look at that horse!
look at the muscles he's got.
them long legs.
they're made for running, horses.
running away from danger.
running away is all they have.
and yet we taught 'em opposite.
running into the fray.
- a war horse.
- yeah.
war horse.
there he is.
what a strange beast you've become.
and now?
i'll take him back with me, yeah?
since i supplied the cutters,
the horse is mine. this is fair, no?
in a pig's eye.
he's english, plain to see.
- you mean because he's so filthy?
- because he's so smart!
and you're none too clean yourself.
we could box.
and the winner gets the horse.
no, thanks, pet.
must be careful not to start a war.
do you have a coin of any sort?
- coin toss?
- yeah.
- all right, fritz, you're on.
- my name is not fritz.
it is peter.
peter. i'm colin.
- you call it, colin.
- heads.
that's the face of my kaiser,
and he does not look pleased with me.
the horse is yours.
gone quiet, hasn't it?
yes.
but wait half an hour
and we'll be shooting again.
i'm a terrible shot, pete.
don't believe i'll ever hit a target.
thanks.
cheerio, mate.
- you'll take good care of him, yes?
- i will.
our strange beast.
and you take care
of your own strange self.
colin!
a pair of german cutters.
in memory of your handsome friend
from dusseldorf.
thanks. i'll use them back
in the garden in south shields.
you keep your head down now, pete,
my lad.
remarkable.
a remarkable horse!
we're full up. move on.
we're full up. move on.
the gas got him.
we had to wait till morning.
- this can't be all of us.
- this is all.
all walking wounded
away to the dressing station!
away to the dressing station!
just hold still.
you're doing so well.
- what's this doing here?
- we need a vet, sir.
there are no vets.
there are scarcely any horses left.
he's cut all over,
but this leg here has got the worst of it.
- it's probably tetanus. it's no good.
- please, sir!
i've all these men to take care of,
corporal. you can see that, can't you?
please, sir,
this horse can pull through anything!
what is it?
it's a horse they found wandering about
in no man's land. down you go.
what kind of a horse?
bloody miraculous kind of a horse
be my guess.
nothing makes it out of no man's land.
miraculous horse.
he was alive, you see, sir,
where nothing survives.
soto me and my mates,
to the men, sir, he's...
well, we have high hopes for him.
you should shoot him now.
- oh, but i can't.
- it'd be a mercy, lad.
that leg's not going to mend.
sergeant.
put him out of his misery.
he's not going to
shoot it here, is he?
what's going on here?
they're going
to shoot the horse.
ladies, if you please.
come, nurses.
all right, back off! back off!
go on, do it again. go on.
joey?
hello, joey. where you been then, eh?
where in the world you been?
do you know this man?
- what's your name?
- narracott.
private albert narracott, sir.
it's just a random horse, narracott,
and too badly injured.
- is this man in your care?
- yes, sir.
he's not random at all, sir!
he's my horse. i raised him, in devon.
sir, look at his legs.
he's got four white socks,
he's brown all over,
and he has a white mark here, like so.
- take him back.
- come on, son.
wait! you can't see 'cause of the mud!
four white socks.
all right, break it up!
clear off, the lot of ya!
you see, sir? he's not random at all.
we'll attend to your horse.
patch him up best we can.
treat him like the soldier he is.
thank you, sir.
gentlemen!
gentlemen!
it falls on me to give you
some important news.
at 11:00 today, in two minutes' time,
the war will come to an end.
the king and queen
thank you for your service.
we have been victorious,
even if it's a higher price
than many of us might have imagined.
when the bells ring out,
and they will in a moment,
for the first time in four years,
let us remember our brothers
fallen in the field,
and thank god
for the end of this struggle,
and victory.
i don't understand, sir.
officers' horses only. all other horses
are to be auctioned immediately.
that is a complete and bloody outrage.
it's the lad's horse, sir! from devon.
he raised him up from a pup, he did.
trained him right up to the day
when the army came to town!
these aren't my orders, sergeant.
you'll have to take him
to market tomorrow.
that's all.
we've all clubbed together.
it's everything we have.
there's 29 pounds there. buy him back.
does the major know?
the major put in 10. mum's the word
where the major's concerned.
your friend, on the crutches over there,
even asked the major to say
that joey was his, an officer's horse,
so that he could go back with the others.
come on, narracott, get a move on.
we don't want to miss the show.
<i>seven pounds!
seven pounds there!</i>
seven pounds! eight pounds here!
eight pounds!
ten pounds here! any advance? sold!
all right. no one's going to bid
more than 15 for a thoroughbred.
they want workhorses.
next one!
we start at four pounds!
four pounds!
- five pounds!
- five pounds here!
- any advance?
- seven pounds!
- eight pounds!
- nine pounds!
- nine.
- ten pounds!
ten pounds!
- eleven!
- eleven!
it's the butcher from cambrai. he's
been bidding for the best all morning.
eleven pounds.
let me handle this, private. fifteen!
and let that be an end to it!
fifteen pounds!
- sixteen!
- sixteen pounds.
seventeen!
twenty of your english pounds.
and let that be the end of it, my friend.
twenty pounds!
- twenty-five!
twenty-five pounds!
twenty-six.
twenty-six pounds!
- twenty-seven!
twenty-eight!
twenty-eight pounds.
twenty-nine!
and thirty!
any advance on thirty pounds?
one hundred pounds!
and, sir, if you bid against me,
i will sell the coat on my back
and bid to 110.
and if you bid against me again,
i will sell my farm,
and bid to a thousand!
one hundred pounds!
going, going.
gone!
sir.
i'll give you all your money,
everything you paid,
when we get back to england.
- i'll give you twice what...
- you don't know anything about him.
but you're wrong, sir. i know everything.
yes, you found him.
i heard you found a horse
in the wire between the armies.
no, i found him. he raised him.
when i heard about the miracle horse,
i traveled three days
because i knew whose horse he was.
my granddaughter's.
she saved his life.
he was everything to her.
where is your granddaughter?
the war has taken everything
from everyone.
he is all that i have left of her.
don't be worried, boy, when i go.
i won't worry over you none.
hey, i found you, didn't i?
and you found me.
and we'll both...
we'll both know
that we made it through.
now come on.
we're the lucky ones.
always have been.
lucky since the day i met you.
god be with you, sir.
do you know what this is?
that's my father's.
that's his regimental pennant.
how did you come by this, sir?
you may have this.
thank you ever so much for this, sir.
and this.
- sir, i...
- no, no, no.
not necessary. he belongs to you.
that is, of course,
what my little girl would have wanted.
and she was the boss.
what was her name?
emilie.
her name is emilie.
