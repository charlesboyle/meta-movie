show me the logic. father?
what?
the devil is a practical man.
if she were a witch, she was

there is so much done in christendom

you must release your brother.
i cannot do without him.

- [man ♪2] jerusalem?
in peril, my lord, as always.
we have stood there against

now i may be old-fashioned,

i have, uh, an artificer,

which son of the blacksmith of my time

balian, the eldest.

private matter.
it's been six and 20 years

now he returns an actual baron

[continues chuckling]
[chattering in foreign language]
[shallow breathing]
do you know...
what lies in the holy land?
a new world.
a man who, in france,
had not a house...
is, in the holy land,
the master of a city.
he who was the master of a city
begs in the gutter.
there, at the end of the world...
you are not
what you were born...
but what you have it
in yourself to be.
i hope to find forgiveness.
that's all i know.
[shallow breathing continues]
whatever your position,
you are of my house...
<i>and that means you will serve
the king of jerusalem.</i>
what could a king ask
of a man like me?
a better world
than has ever been seen.
a kingdom of conscience.
a kingdom of heaven.
<i>there is peace between
christian and muslim.</i>
<i>we live together.</i>
or, between saladin
and the king, we try.
<i>did you think that lay
at the end of crusade?</i>
it does.
<i>my son, you are all
that survives me.</i>
do not disappoint me.
when we took the holy land,
we took the saracen trading ports.
italian ships carry silks and spices
and pilgrims, if they have money.
and italy becomes rich
as the savior intended.
<i>[man chanting prayer]</i>
<i>who are those men?</i>

<i>i am outside god's grace.</i>
<i>i have not heard that.</i>
at any rate, it seems...
i have lost my religion.
i put no stock in religion.
<i>by the word "religion"...</i>
<i>i've seen the lunacy of fanatics of every
denomination be called the will of god.</i>
i've seen too much religion

and courage on behalf of those
who cannot defend themselves.
and goodness—

is here and here.
by what you decide to do every day,
you will be a good man.
or not.
come.
[shouting, yelling]
[shouting continues]
the king has made a peace
with saladin these past six years.
he holds jerusalem as a place
for prayer for all faiths...
as the muslims did before we came.
<i>these men are templars.
they killed arabs.</i>
[crowd cheering, shouting]
so they are dying...
for what the pope
would command them to do.
yes. but not christ, i think.
nor this king.
<i>[cheering continues]</i>
who says i raid?
that witness...
<i>all of jerusalem...</i>
<i>holy god and me.</i>
that witness, if you call him that,
is a saracen. he lies.
<i>there will come a day,
reynald de chatillon...</i>
<i>when you are not protected
by your title.</i>
oh? when will that be?
alert me, tiberias,
when men are equal...
and the kingdom of heaven
has arrived.
<i>those templars have been hung for
a raid that i know you commanded.</i>
prove it.
i will wait at kerak
until you do.
<i>the king will take
your castle of kerak, reynald.</i>
try to take it,
tiberias.
i'll be there.
<i>[speaking arabic]</i>
i cannot protect your caravans unless
you agree to be escorted by our soldiers.
<i>i trade to make money...</i>
not to offend god by
associating with christians.
<i>- but you will take christian gold.
- gold is gold.</i>
mmm. of course.
my lord tiberias.
<i>my lord.</i>
it's true.
you're your father's son.
he was my friend.
i am yours.
godfrey dead.
it could have come
at a better time. come.
it was shouted in the streets that
you killed a great lord of syria.
saladin himself sent word...
that your fight
did not breach the peace...
that you had cause.
<i>what know you of saladin?</i>
that he is king of the saracens...
and that he surrounds
this kingdom.
he has 200,000 men
in damascus alone.
he could win a war
if he goes to war...
and he's daily given cause for war
by fanatics newly from europe...
by templar bastards
like reynald de chatillon.
here, from this room, i keep the peace,
so far as it can be kept.
but saladin and the king
between them...
would make a better world.
if it lives only for a while,
tiberias, it still has lived.
all right.
what did your father tell you
of your... obligations?
that i was to be a good knight.
<i>i pray the world...</i>
and jerusalem...
can accommodate such a rarity...
as a perfect knight.
have you dined?
[chattering]
the princess sibylla of jerusalem...
and her husband,
guy de lusignan.
<i>[tiberias] so, how many knights
did you find in france?</i>
fifty.
they've sworn allegiance to the king?
<i>of course, tiberias.</i>
obviously.
you sit at my table?
- is it not the king's table?
- is it? i have not seen a king
at it for some years.
i cannot eat.
i— i am finicky about company.
<i>in france this could not inherit.</i>
but here there are no civilized rules.
i have business in the east.
my wife does not
lament my absences.
that is either the best of wives...
<i>or the very, very worst.</i>
- do you go to meet reynald?
- no, my lord. he is in disfavor.
i am a member of this court.
why should i make league
with that... troublemaker?
to the very best of wives.
- [speaking arabic]
- god bless jerusalem.
[whispers]
my lord, the king will see him now.
the king would see godfrey's son.
i'll take him.
this morning i spoke
without knowing who you were.
<i>i knew who you were.
it's unmistakable.</i>
i loved your father...
and i shall love you.
do you fear being with me?
no.
- and yes.
- [chuckles]
a woman in my place
has two faces.
one for the world...
and one which she wears
in private.
with you i'll be only sibylla.
<i>[floor creaks]</i>
[whispers]
tiberias thinks me unpredictable.
i am unpredictable.
no. there.
come forward.
i am glad to meet godfrey's son.
he was one of
my greatest teachers.
he was there when, playing with
the other boys, my arm was cut.
and it was he, not my father's physicians,
who noticed that i felt no pain.
he wept when he gave
my father the news...
that i am a leper.
<i>the saracens say
that this disease...</i>
is god's vengeance against
the vanity of our kingdom.
as wretched as i am...
<i>these arabs believe that
the chastisement that awaits me in hell...</i>
is far more severe and lasting.
if that's true, i call it unfair.
come. sit.
- do you play?
- no.
the whole world is in chess.
any move can be the death of you.
<i>do anything except
remain where you started...</i>
and you can't be sure of your end.
were you sure of your end once?
<i>- i was.
- what was it?</i>
to be buried a hundred yards
from where i was born.
and now?
now i sit in jerusalem
and look upon a king.
[chuckles]
when i was 16
i won a great victory.
i felt, in that moment,
i would live to be 100.
now i know i shall not see 30.
<i>none of us know our end, really...</i>
or what hand will guide us there.
a king may move a man.
a father may claim a son.
<i>that man can also move himself.</i>
<i>and only then does that man
truly begin his own game.</i>
<i>remember, how so ever
you are played...</i>
or by whom, your soul
is in your keeping alone...
even though those who presume
to play you be kings or men of power.
when you stand before god,
you cannot say...
"but i was told by others to do thus"...
or that virtue was not
convenient at the time.
this will not suffice.
<i>remember that.</i>
i will.
you know what this is?
- a fortification.
- what do you think of it?
<i>you disapprove.
well, how would you improve it?</i>
a cross.
or better, a star, like this.
that way no part of the fortress
may be approached...
without being exposed
to fire from another part.
yes, i like this. your walls
are more difficult to address.
very good.
<i>you will go to your father's house
at ibelin, your house now...</i>
<i>and then from there
you will protect the pilgrim road.</i>
safeguard in particular
the jews and the muslims.
all are welcome in jerusalem.
not only because it's expedient,
but because it is right.
protect the helpless.
<i>and then maybe one day,
when i am helpless...</i>
you will come and protect me.
<i>there, my lord.</i>
ibelin.

<i>god did not favor him. god, alone,

are determined by god...</i>

the absence of disease
and the availability of water.
<i>one cannot maintain a siege

how many battles did god win
for the muslims before i came?
that is, before god determined
that i should come.
few enough.
that's because we were sinful.
it is because
you were unprepared.

<i>[whinnying]</i>
always surround your knights
with your foot soldiers.
these rooms are not yours.
one day i will be the husband
i was commissioned to be.
and perhaps not, my dear.
<i>your lover has a hundred knights
and the love of the king.</i>
i, the largest force
in the kingdom...
and the support of the templars.
i can do without
the king's affection.
but as for your love—
then we must come
to an understanding.
<i>you need my knights or his rule
will be bloody and brief.</i>
so, my friend...
the time has come
to conclude my affairs.
if i leave the army with guy...
he will take power through my sister
and make war on the muslims.
we have decided that you shall take
command of the army of jerusalem.
<i>will you defend my nephew
when he's king?</i>
whatever you ask.
i will serve.
no, hear it all
before you answer.
would you marry my sister, sibylla,
were she free of guy de lusignan?
and guy?
he will be executed...
along with his knights who
do not swear your allegiance.
i cannot be the cause of that.
"whatever you ask.
i will serve."
"a king may move a man,"
you said...
"but the soul belongs
to the man."
yes, i did.
you have my love...
and my answer.
oh. so be it.
why do you protect guy, hmm?
he's a man who insults you,
who hates you...
who'd kill you himself
if he had the chance.
<i>fulfill the salvation of this kingdom.</i>
<i>would it be so hard...</i>
to marry sibylla?
<i>jerusalem has no need
of a perfect knight.</i>
no. it is a kingdom
of conscience...
or nothing.
sibylla.
who are you to refuse a king?
i will have power,
without guy or with him.
guy is indebted to your say-so
and my brother's, but it's mine.
do you have any idea of jerusalem
except that it is yours?
you will never hold it in peace
as your brother did.
it will be war.
my grandfather took
jerusalem in blood.
i'll keep it the same way
or any way i can.
i am what i am.
i offer you that...
and the world.
you say no.
do you think i'm like guy?
that i would sell my soul?
there'll be a day...
<i>when you will wish you
had done a little evil...</i>
to do a greater good.
<i>- [man] reynald.

i don't love him.
