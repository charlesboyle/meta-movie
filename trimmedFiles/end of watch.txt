you guys don't have the proper clearance for any of this information, but i'm going to throw you a bone.
cartels are operating here.
we're on it.
be careful.
what does that mean though?
it means you and your homeboy need to power down.
because you just tugged on the tail of the snake and it's going to turn around and bite you back.
i'm throwing you a bone here.
be grateful for what i'm giving you.
i'm giving you a warning.

she was pissed.
how'd you know you were going to marry gabby?
she told me.
i was just some stoner working at my uncle's muffler shop and one day she grabbed me by the shoulders...
and said ‘we're getting married and you're joining the department'
because you can make a lot of money without a college degree and i was like ‘fuck yeah'.
i mean, you love her.
you guys, you never fight.
you're happy together.
she's my bitch for sure.
i'm just telling you the way it went down.
i popped her cherry in high school.
she's never been with anybody else.
i've never wanted to be with anybody else.
you know, it's easy.
things are getting super serious with janet and me.
what, you just found that out?
did you read that in the paper or something?
homegirl owns your ass.
she wants to move in.
she's always over.
why spend the money on two apartments.
it's not about the money.
no, her parents are so traditional.
oh yeah?
they will go ballistic.
but at least we can tell them we're engaged.
hold up.
don't play with that shit.
you don't ask a broad to marry you because her folks are old school.
no, you don't understand.
no, you don't do that shit.
think about it.
after you think about it, think about it again.
jesus.
marriage is forever.
just realize that.
it's a promise before god.
my grandma was really deep.
she's seen it all.
you know what i'm saying?
when me and gabby got engaged, she asked me one thing.
do you want to hear it?
fine, let's hear it.
she said can you live without her?
and if the answer's yes, man up and forget her.
don't string her along.

yoked assholes, man.
yoked assholes from the joint when they had weight piles.
you know what i'm talking about?
you don't know what i'm talking about,
you're fucking twelve years old.
cops like him... like soldiers.
he took a bullet for me.
my bullet.
he took my bullet.
he took my bullet.
that's what he was.
that's what he was to me.
it should have been me.
cause he was a good guy.
i was shit.
fuck it.
gimme a kiss.
you'll learn this.
you'll learn.
marriage is really basic.
there's just a couple guidelines.
one: you've got to give it up all the time.
all the time.
you love that.
i don't hate that idea.
it's not a bad idea.
it's not a bad thing.
no, seriously, girls throw it at cops.
throw what exactly?
their pussy.
girls throw it.
so you can't give him an excuse, girlfriend.
you can not give him an excuse.
i've actually seen that before.
it's called assault on a peace officer.
you ready?
hell yeah.
try new things.
baby...
like the gooch.
the what?
the gooch?
texas twister.
no, that's something that's made up.
the internet made that up.
you want to know what mike likes?

babe, i love you so much.
the western, you know?

gabby!
it's our wedding!
cup him.
suck him.
no no no!
you just rub it a bit and then….
what the fuck?
gabby!
venture off a little more.
venture off?
they swear they don't like it but...
shit!
really?
i'm happy.
janet's dope.
you're my brother and everything, but you're a piece of shit.
does she know that?
yeah, she knows who i am.
i mean, you can't get into something with somebody without ... she knows who i am.
yeah.
i know who you are.
you're a piece of shit.
if you break her heart, i'm going to fuck you up.
good to know.
if anything happened to you, i would take care of your kids.
if you had any.
and i would take care of her.
i would take care of janet.
what's in the stack?
anything good?
let's see here... business dispute.
request police mediation.
one neighbor threw a cup of water on the other neighbor's window.
we're not buying that.
three ninety male.
intoxicated person outside a liquor store.
get the fuck out of here.
there's a drunk man outside the liquor store?
welfare check.
woman requests pd contact her elderly mother.
yeah, buy that one.
you serious?
yeah, if we buy a couple of these, maybe they'll send us a code three call.
cool.
i'll hit her up for the next hotshots.
on this episode, we're rolling to a call.
a woman called the station to check on her elderly mother.
so we're going to go.
these are the calls most agencies deal with, you know?
not every call's a foot pursuit or a car chase.
some guys at other agencies have never even drawn their weapon or been in a gunfight.
yeah, but here that's just half your shift.
in the south end...
we'll get involved in more capers in one deployment period than most cops see their entire career.
hell yeah.
mrs. williams!
mrs.williams!
police officers!
go around back, check it out.
all right.
here we go.
i'm going to wait for my partner.
he's going to check the back to see if she's around the back over there.
often times, a lot of these people, they're very old people.
they can't hear us.
you know, they can't hear – the hearing aids, you know.
nothing.
so the owner of this house is actually the daughter of the woman who lives in it.
she gave us permission for the welfare check, so we're going to... we're going to boot the door.
officer zavala specializes in booting doors.
i kick doors down.
there you go.
i kick doors down.
say it in english now.
i kick doors down.
wait, did you check if it was unlocked?
ladies and gentlemen, always a good idea to make sure a door is locked ... before you boot it.
are you going to cut that out?
yeah, sorry.
it was always locked.
clearly my partner always knew that.
you know what's going to happen, right?
what?
she's going to roll through, come from
the church or the store or whatever.
and then she's going to see property
damage and what's going to happen?
what's going to happen?
we're going to be the bad guys.
shit.
we got a dead body.
what have we got?
squatters?
yeah, i'd say someone's been kicking it back here for sure.
lapd
let's roll through.
you good?
clear.
that is wrong.
i said it was clear.

i got a hella big family, right?
fuck, i don’t want to hear that.
i got a hella big family.
someone’s always at my house.
but one time, gabby’s parents bounced to ensenada and her brother
crashed at his girlfriend’s so i spent the night at her house.
and this was going to be the night.
it was going to be the night, you know what i’m saying?
no, what are you talking about?
well i’ll tell you what i’m talking about.
ok cool

it’s about to go down.
i’m taking off her chones, i’m taking off--
chones?
her skivvies, come on.

someone’s in the pad.
so i hide underneath the bed.
and then i hear people coming up.
and it’s her parents.
this is the second floor.
what?
i got nowhere to go.
homegirl’s trying to distract them, but it ain’t happening.
and the footsteps grow louder.
louder and louder.
then the door opens – oh my god, i’m naked...
underneath the bed.
and then all i can seeis little footsteps.
i see his hairy feet and i see her nails all painted
and they’re yapping, they’re doing their thing.
and they crash.
and this is the part i never told gabby... i hear a little smootchie smootch,
and i hear some shit, and i’m praying, please no.
and they did it.
what? ... what?
they got down!
i’m talking gabby’s parents fucking!

the shit was so traumatic.
it must have been a little uncomfortable around the folks after that.
yeah, because her father’s a freak.
i guess when you’ve been married that long, you gotta mix it up a little bit.
i tried rolling like that with gabby and she was like hell no,
you’re not touching me there.
it makes me fucking uncomfortable.
i know, you know why?
because you’re a freak too.
don’t go there, just don’t go there.
