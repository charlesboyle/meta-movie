look, i'm at the hospital.
yeah, okay. bye.
miss hoover?
your brother's fine.
<i>i need you to keep him away
from sharp objects-knives, scissors.</i>
<i>if you have medications, depressants
in your house, keep them secure.</i>
<i>- i'd prefer to keep him, but-
- i know. the insurance.</i>
you want to see him?
hey, frank.
sheryl.
i'm so glad you're still here.
well, that makes one of us.
<i>a strong low pressure
system passed across new mexico...</i>
<i>bringing with it a little moisture
that will cool things off a bit.</i>
<i>we may even see a five- to 10-degree drop
in temperatures in albuquerque.</i>
<i>there will be no significant
accumulations of rainfall-</i>
do you want to talk or no?
<i>- nearly nothing, but statewide 93%-
- no.</i>
hello?
anyone?
down here.
we have you with dwayne.
<i>dwayne, hi.
uncle frank's here.</i>
he doesn't mind, frank.
we talked.
<i>wha- i know. i know. but we can't have you
sleeping alone. the doctor said.</i>
i'm sorry.
i have to insist.
you'll get along fine.
he's really quiet.
<i>and here's your cot.</i>
please, frank.
please.
thank you.
i'm gonna start dinner.
you can come out
when you're settled.
and, uh, just leave the door open.
that's important.
dwayne, honey, there's
a bucket of chicken in the car.
can you get it?
and, uh, i'll make a salad.
<i>- olive?
- yeah?</i>
<i>- is grandpa with you?
- yeah.</i>
<i>- what are you guys doing?
- rehearsing.</i>
<i>- okay, well, dinner in 10 minutes.
- okay.</i>
- hi.
- hi. frank's here.
oh, god.
did, uh, stan grossman call?
<i>well, check the machine.</i>
- dwayne, please, come on.
the chicken. it's in the car.
will you set the table?
we'll do paper plates tonight.
<i>remember olive
was runner-up in the little miss sunshine?</i>
<i>- theyjust called right now-
- hey, it's your sister!</i>
fuck.
hi. richard hoover
for stan grossman, please.
any way to reach him or-
<i>well, i'm just wondering
if this darn book deal is done or not.</i>
<i>if-</i>
<i>yes.</i>
okay, could you please just have him
call me anytime over the weekend?
he has my cell number.
just to let me know we're on.
okay? thank you. bye.
- so what happened with stan grossman?
- he's in scottsdale.
<i>why didn't he call?</i>
will you let me
worry about this, please?
dwayne, can you check on frank?
tell him it's dinnertime.
<i>olive! dinnertime!</i>
<i>coming!</i>
what? dinner?
what, you don't talk anymore?
<i>why not?</i>
<i>you can talk.
you just choose not to?</i>
<i>is that nietzsche?</i>
you don't speak
because of friedrich nietzsche.
far out.
<i>frank, you can sit here next to dwayne.</i>
here's the salad, and i'm gonna run
and get sprite for everyone.
<i>olive, come on!
dinnertime!</i>
<i>okay.</i>
so who do you hang out with?
no one?
<i>what about your family?</i>
<i>frank! hey!</i>
- richard.
- good to... see you.
let me get olive.
<i>- olive? dad?
- you guys, go on and start.</i>
<i>- let's go!
- we're coming.</i>
<i>- frank, some sprite?
- yes.</i>
<i>and i want everyone to have
at least a little salad.</i>
thanks, sheryl.
honey.
so, sheryl, i couldn't help noticing
dwayne has stopped speaking.
oh, yeah, he's taken a vow of silence.
you've taken a vow of silence?
<i>yeah. he's gonna join the air force academy,
become a test pilot...</i>
and he's taken a vow of silence
until he reaches that goal.
<i>- you're kidding?
- hi, uncle frank.</i>
oh, hey, olive.
wow, you're gettin' big.
<i>almost like a real person.</i>
- what happened to your arms?
- olive.
<i>that's all right.
i had a little accident. i'm okay.</i>
- how's the, uh, routine coming, honey?
- it's good.
yeah? when are you
gonna show it to us?
i don't know.
it's up to grandpa.
a couple of days.
it still needs work.
what's that? chicken?
every night it's the fuckin' chicken!
- holy god almighty! it is possible just once-
- dad!
we could get something to eat around here
that's not the goddamn fucking chicken?
<i>- hey, dad! dad!
- i'm just sayin'-</i>
<i>- christ.
- when you want to start cooking your own food, you're welcome.</i>
- at sunset manor, you know- - if you like
sunset manor, you shouldn't have got kicked out.
<i>for god's sakes.</i>
so when did you start
with the vow?
<i>been nine months, frank.
he hasn't said a word.</i>
not one. i think it shows
tremendous discipline.
- richard.
- i really do.
really. i think we could
learn something from dwayne.
dwayne has a goal.
he has a dream.
it may not be my dream,
may not be yours...
but he's pursuing it with
great conviction and focus.
in fact, i was thinking
about the nine steps-
oh, for crying out loud!
and how dwayne's utilizing seven of them
in his personal quest to self-fulfillment.
richard, please.
well, i'm just saying
i've come around.
i think he could use our support.
how did it happen?
- how did what happen?
- your accident.
honey, here.
<i>oh, no, it's okay.
unless you object.</i>
no, i'm pro-honesty here.
i just think, you know, it's up to you.
be my guest.
olive, um, uncle frank
didn't really have an accident.
<i>what happened was he...
tried to kill himself.</i>
<i>you did? why?</i>
i'm sorry. i don't think
this is an appropriate conversation.
honey, let's let uncle frank
finish his dinner, okay? shh.
why did you want to kill yourself?
<i>no, don't answer the question, frank.</i>
<i>- richard! richard!
- he's not gonna answer the question. frank.</i>
- i wanted to kill myself-
- don't listen to him.
<i>- i was very unhappy.
- he's sick in his head.</i>
- richard!
- i'm sorry! i don't think it's an appropriate conversation...
- for a seven-year-old.
- she's gonna find out anyway.
- okay.
- go on, frank.
why were you unhappy?
um, well, there are a lot of reasons.
mainly, though, i fell in love
with someone who didn't love me back.
who?
<i>one of my grad students.
i was very much in love with him.</i>
him?
<i>it was a boy?
you fell in love with a boy?</i>
- yes, i did. very much so.
- that's silly.
<i>you're right. it was silly.
it was very, very silly.</i>
- there's another word for it.
- dad.
<i>- so, that's when you tried to kill yourself?
- well, no.</i>
the boy that i was in love with fell in love
with another man- larry sugarman.
- who's larry sugarman?
- larry sugarman is, perhaps...
the second most highly regarded
proust scholar in the u.s.
- who's number one?
- that would be me, rich.
- really?
- mm-hmm.
so that's when.
no. what happened was
i was a bit upset...
so i said some things
that i shouldn't have said...
<i>and i did some things
that i shouldn't have done...</i>
and subsequently
i was fired from my job...
<i>and forced to move out of my apartment
and move into a motel.</i>
<i>- and that's when you tried to-
- well, no.</i>
actually, all of that was okay.
what happened was two days ago the
macarthur foundation, in its infinite wisdom...
<i>awarded a genius grant
to larry sugarman.</i>
and that's when i-
<i>decided to check out early.</i>
yes. yes. and i failed
at that as well.
<i>olive, the important thing
to understand here...</i>
<i>is that uncle frank
gave up on himself.</i>
he made a series of foolish choices-
i'm sorry- and he gave up on himself...
which is something winners never do.
so that's the story, okay?
now, everyone, just let's move on and, uh-
<i>is he always like this? how can you stand it?</i>
olive, tell him about your
routine while you're doing this.
okay. little miss chili pepper is
a beauty contest for everyone in albuquerque...
but you have to be six or seven
and you have to be a girl.
this is our sister.
- cindy.
- spring break.
dwayne went to see his dad
in florida for two weeks...
and olive went to laguna
to see her cousins.
- she made it to the top of the regionals out there.
- i was in second place.
well, what do you think
your chances are?
i think i can win,
because some of the other girls...
<i>they've been doing it longer,
but i practice every day.</i>
- yeah. good luck.
- not about luck, frank.
<i>luck is the name losers give
to their own failings.</i>
it's about wanting to win,
willing yourself to win.
- you've got to want it badder than anybody else.
- i do.
<i>- then you're gonna be a winner.
- richard.</i>
it's the truth.
<i>you know, actually, there is a message
from cindy on the machine.</i>
something about little mrs. sunshine.
<i>- what? little miss sunshine?
- yeah.</i>
what?
<i>sheryl, it's cindy.</i>
remember when olive
was here last month?
she was runner-up in the
regional little miss sunshine?
<i>theyjust called right now and said that
the girl who won had to forfeit her crown.</i>
i don't know why.
something about diet pills.
- now she has a place in the state
contest in redondo beach!
oh, my gosh! i won!
i won! i won! i won!
<i>- finish your dinner!
- i'm finished!</i>
- what happened?
- i'm just calling to- cindy!
yeah, we just got it.
yeah, she basically went crazy.
<i>- i won! i won! i won!
- no, i didn't get that.</i>
<i>the machine cut you off. okay.</i>
<i>redondo beach. this sunday?</i>
<i>- wh-are you guys going?
- yes.</i>
- can you put it off?
- they have to. they have to.
- where does that leave us?
- we can't do it. we can't.
no, no- no, i understand
that, cindy. yeah.
- they- - i just- no, i'll just
figure it out. okay, bye-bye.
it's this sunday?
why can'tjeff and cindy take her?
they have some equestrian
thing in santa barbara.
you know, they do that horse
shit every single weekend.
well, it's the nationals. they're taking
both horses, so apparently it's a big deal.
what about olive?
little miss sunshine!
little miss sunshine! i won!
i won!
i'm going! we're going!
- you promised?
- we'll fly out and come back monday.
- how are you gonna get around out there?
- we'll rent a car.
- and stay at a hotel?
- we can afford it.
- this is our seed money.
- well, if i had a little help bringin' it in.
- don't start that.
- it all goes to your nine steps!
i told you i'm gonna talk
to stan grossman!
we're gonna get locked and loaded on this
deal and start generating some income!
<i>- but in the meantime we've gotta be-
- okay, okay! we'll drive!</i>
- i'm not drivin'.
- how are you gonna fit grandpa in the miata?
<i>- well, grandpa does not have to come.
- what? i coached her!</i>
i gave her the moves.
i gotta go.
- why don't you take the v. w?
- i cannot drive a shift. i tried.
<i>- we'll fly there.
- we can't afford it.</i>
well, that's what we're gonna do
unless you have a better idea.
here. this is dessert.
<i>i won! i won!
i won! i won! i won!</i>
i won! i won! i won!
<i>miss sunshine! little miss sunshine!
little miss sunshine!</i>
all right.
i'll drive the bus.
richard, i was told explicitly
not to leave frank by himself.
- no offense, frank.
- none taken.
you got dwayne here.
they can look after each other.
no, richard! that's asking too much.
if something happened-
we can't go, then, unless
dwayne and frank go with us.
<i>- mom, where's my bathing suit?
- right.</i>
frank?
<i>i found it!</i>
okay.
<i>i'm going! i'm going!
i'm going!</i>
oh, dwayne, come on, please.
think of your sister.
<i>come on, dwayne.
it'll be a lot of fun.</i>
<i>you can go to the beach and-</i>
<i>"this is unfair.</i>
"all i ask is...
<i>that you leave me alone. "</i>
dwayne, flight school.
i will give you permission
for flight school.
<i>i won! i won! i won! i won!
i'm gonna win this one too!</i>
"but i'm not going...
to have any fun. "
<i>yeah, we're all with you
on that one, dwayne.</i>
grandpa! grandpa!
is grandpa coming to california?
<i>- we're all coming, honey.
- hey, uh, hold on.</i>
olive, come over here
for a second.
<i>come here.
sit down for a second.</i>
look, there's no sense
in entering a contest...
if you don't think
you're gonna win.
so do you think you can win
little miss sunshine?
<i>richard-</i>
are you gonna win?
yes!
we're going to california.
good night, dwayne.
<i>not on your watch.
i wouldn't do that to you.</i>
<i>thank you, dwayne.</i>
coming from you,
that means a lot.
good night.
jesus, i'm tired.
i'm so fucking tired.
do you know how tired i am?
if some girl came up to me,
begged me to fuck her, i couldn't do it.
<i>- dad? watch the language, huh?
- that's how tired i am.</i>
she's listening to music.
olive, i'll give you a million dollars
if you turn around.
<i>- see?
- all right.</i>
<i>- but the rest of us.
- oh, the rest of you.</i>
can i give you some advice?
well, i'm gonna
give it to you anyway.
- i don't want you making the same mistakes i made.
- can't wait to hear this.
dwayne-that's your name,
right? dwayne?
<i>this is the voice
of experience talking.</i>
<i>are you listening?
fuck a lot of women, dwayne.</i>
<i>- hey! dad!
- not just one woman. a lot of women.</i>
<i>- that's enough, all right?
- are you gettin' any?</i>
<i>- dad!
- you can tell me, dwayne. are you gettin' any?</i>
<i>- come on, please.
- no? jesus. you're what, 15?</i>
<i>- my god, man!
- dad!</i>
<i>you should be gettin'that young stuff.
that young stuff is the best in the world.</i>
- dad, that's enough! stop it!
- will you kindly not interrupt!
see, right now you're jailbait.
they're jailbait. it's perfect.
i mean, you hit 18- man, you're
talking about three to five.
hey, i will pull
this truck over right now!
so pull the truck over!
fuck you! i can say what i want.
- i still got nazi bullets in my ass!
- ah, the nazi bullets!
you're as bad as those fuckers at sunset manor.
- what happened at sunset manor?
- frank, don't encourage him.
<i>i'll tell you what happened.
i paid my money. they took my money.</i>
i should be able to do
what the fuck i want!
- he started snorting heroin.
- you started snorting heroin?
- i'm old!
- well, that stuff'll kill you.
what am i, an idiot?
and don't you start taking that shit.
when you're young,
you're crazy to do that stuff.
- what about you?
- i'm old. when you're old, you're crazy not to do it.
<i>we've tried. believe me. the intervention
was a fiasco. he's worse than a two-year-old.</i>
can we please talk
about something else?
<i>- i take it you didn't like it at sunset manor.
- frank.</i>
are you kidding me?
it was a fuckin' paradise.
they got a pool.
they got golf.
now i'm stuck with mr. happy here,
sleepin' on a fuckin' sofa.
<i>look, i know you're a homo and all,
but maybe you can appreciate this.</i>
you go to one of those places,
there's four women for every guy.
- can you imagine what that's like?
- you must've been very busy.
whoa! i had second-degree burns
on my johnson. i kid you not.
<i>- really?
- forget about it.</i>
what are you guys
talking about?
politics.
oh.
fuck a lot of women, kid.
i have no reason to lie to you.
not one woman.
a lot of women.
<i>you heard what i said?
did it go in anywhere?</i>
yeah, i think
we get the point, dad.
don't show me the pad.
i don't want to see the fuckin' pad.
mom, how much can we spend?
<i>i would say four dollars.
anything under four dollars.</i>
hi. you ready?
yeah, i'm gonna have the,
uh, number five with coffee, please.
<i>all right.</i>
a number seven, over easy,
and a grapefruit juice.
- grapefruit. okay.
- i would like a fruit plate.
<i>- and do you have chamomile?
- yes.</i>
<i>- with honey, please.
- i would like the lumberjack and coffee.</i>
<i>- and extra bacon.
- extra.</i>
- now, dad, you should probably-
- richard, don't start.
- he's gonna kill himself.
- well, it's his life.
<i>- thank you, sheryl.
- garden salad?</i>
and you.
<i>- l- i'm sorry. i, um- sorry.
- take your time.</i>
<i>don't apologize, olive.
it's a sign of weakness.</i>
<i>um, well, i want- okay, okay.
i know what i want. i know.</i>
okay, can i get
the waffles and, uh-
i don't-
what does "alamodey" mean?
- oh, that means it comes with ice cream.
- okay, "alamodey" then.
<i>- olive, for breakfast?
- you said four dollars.</i>
okay. you're right.
thank you.
okay. be right back.
<i>actually, olive,
"à la mode"in french...</i>
translates literally
as "in the fashion. "
à la mode.
<i>"mode"is derived from latin modus,
meaning "due or proper measure. "</i>
<i>- frank, shut up.
- richard!</i>
<i>olive, can i tell you a little
something about ice cream?</i>
<i>- yeah.
- well, ice cream is made from cream...</i>
which comes from cow's milk...
and cream has a lot of fat in it.
- richard.
- what?
- she's gonna find out anyway, remember?
- what? find out what?
well, when you eat ice cream, the fat
in the ice cream becomes fat in your body.
<i>- richard, i swear to god-
- it's true.</i>
- what? what's wrong?
- nothing, honey. nothing's wrong.
so if you eat a lot of ice cream,
you might become fat.
and if you don't, you're gonna
stay nice and skinny, sweetie.
- mom-
- olive, richard is an idiot.
i like a woman
with meat on her bones.
<i>i don't- why's everyone so upset?</i>
<i>no, no one's upset, honey. l-</i>
i just want you to understand...
it's okay to be skinny, and it's okay
to be fat, if that's what you want to be.
whatever you want, it's okay.
<i>okay, but, olive,
let me ask you this.</i>
those women in miss america-
are they skinny,
or are they fat?
<i>honey?</i>
<i>well, they're skinny, i guess.</i>
<i>yeah. i guess they don't
eat a lot of ice cream.</i>
<i>okay. coffee. coffee.</i>
- grapefruit.
- thank you.
chamomile.
and here's your ice cream.
"alamodey," right? i'll be back
with your waffles in a second.
does anyone want my ice cream?
<i>yeah, i'd like a little.
dwayne? frank?</i>
- olive's not gonna have her ice cream.
- do you mind if i have a little?
- yeah, let's dig in.
- that looks really good.
<i>boy, i feel sorry for anybody...</i>
that doesn't want to enjoy their ice cream
so early in the morning.
<i>- boy, that looks good.
- you sure you don't wanna have some, olive?</i>
<i>those waffles are gonna be
awful lonely in there.</i>
- mmm! mmm!
- watch this.
wait! stop!
don't eat it all.
- all right, olive-
- richard!
hey, stan!
stan, it's richard. again.
listen, i know you're busy...
but we're just dying to hear what sort
of numbers you came up with in scottsdale.
- so, uh, give me a call, please.
- hey, did you get him?
no, i can't get a signal out of this thing.
<i>how long till we get there?</i>
- a long time, honey.
- i know. but how long?
well, we gotta do 600 miles of driving
today and 200 tomorrow.
- that's a lot of driving. let's go.
- i'll drive for a while.
- no, no. i got it.
- no. i gotta learn how to do this.
you're doing it.
how hard can it be?
- push the stick down hard.
- i'm pushing hard.
<i>okay. okay, there you go.</i>
now push the clutch in
all the way to the floor.
it's on the floor.
the floor.
sticking on there.
push down hard.
well, you've got a problem.
your clutch is, uh, shot.
can we get a new one?
<i>these old buses, you-
you have to order the part.</i>
how long does it take?
well, it's the weekend...
so... maybe... thursday.
is there a, uh,
dealership around here?
well, uh, they're
probably gonna be closed.
it's, uh-
it's the weekend, you know.
yes, we're aware of that.
i'll tell you what.
you know these- these old buses?
you don't need the clutch to change from-
from the third to the fourth.
you only really need the clutch to go
from number one to number two.
<i>but as long as you keep
parking on a hill...</i>
<i>and you let it go, and it goes
you start her in third,
and you go from third to fourth.
what if you're not
on a hill? there's no hill.
what if there's no hill?
what do you-
yeah, it's-
olive, dad, i want you
in the car first.
- i know. we know.
- all right, here we go!
everybody push!
all right.
<i>here we go! push! push!</i>
ok- ok- okay!
i just want everyone here to know...
that i am the preeminent
proust scholar in the united states.
<i>here we go!</i>
<i>- go on, honey.
- i'm putting it in gear!</i>
<i>- go, honey!
- come on!</i>
come on, olive!
run! run! come on!
- come on!
- sheryl, let's go!
sheryl!
<i>- frank, let's go!
- i'm coming.</i>
<i>- you're losing them. slow down!
- i can't slow down!</i>
- come on! come on! come on, you dumb bastard!
- i can't. i can't slow down.
- i can't slow down!
- let's go!
<i>help him. come on!</i>
come on. come on. get in.
no one gets left behind.
- close the door!
- no one gets left behind!
outstanding, soldier!
outstanding!
outstanding.
- was that fun?
- yeah.
<i>so finally i'm just sitting there...</i>
and i decide, you know,
"this is stan grossman. what the hell?"
and i start pitching him
the nine steps.
<i>and about- i don't know-
two minutes in, he stops me, he says...</i>
"i can sell this. "
<i>mm-hmm. interesting.</i>
yeah, and this is the guy
who knows how to do it.
you start with a book, and then you do a media
tour, corporate events, dvd, vhs series.
<i>i mean, there's a whole fascinating science
into how you roll these things out.</i>
<i>- wow.
- yeah, so he's in scottsdale right now, you know...</i>
<i>building the buzz and kind of getting
the whole hype thing going.</i>
<i>he's doing what the pros call
a ticking clock auction.</i>
oh, how about that!
yeah, and i can detect
that note of sarcasm there, frank.
what sarcasm? i didn't-
i didn't hear it.
but i want you
to know something.
i feel sorry for you.
you do? good.
<i>yeah, i do. because sarcasm
is the refuge oflosers.</i>
<i>- it is? really?
- yep.</i>
sarcasm is losers trying to bring
winners down to their level...
and that's step four in the program.
wow, richard, you've really opened
my eyes to what a loser i am.
- how much do i owe you for those pearls of wisdom?
- that one's on the house.
<i>- okay, you guys, that's enough.
- it's on the house.</i>
- that was for free?
- no charge. no charge.
- stop it!
- he started it.
<i>that's- oh, wait a second.</i>
<i>- you are so bad.
- quiet. this is it. this is that call.</i>
he-hello?
stan?
stan?
stan grossman?
richard hoover.
finally. how're ya doin'?
no, i know. we were, uh, on the highway,
and i lost you on my cell.
forget about it.
how'd we do?
honey, i'm gonna use the ladies' room.

richard.
yeah.
whatever happens, you tried
to do something on your own...
which is more than
most people ever do...
and i include myself
in that category.
you took a big chance.
that took guts, and i'm proud of you.
okay, dad.
thank you.
thank you, dad.
<i>okay, here is 11.</i>
frank, you're 12.
and grandpa's 13.
can i sleep with grandpa tonight?
well, you'll have to ask grandpa.
- grandpa?
- i got two beds.
you could still use some rehearsing.
<i>yeah, that's what i was thinking.</i>
all right, everybody,
we have a long day tomorrow.
i'll knock on your doors at 7:00 a. m.
that means no lollygagging.
we need to be packed
and on the road by 7:40, guys.
- frank, you guys'll be okay?
- yeah, we're fine.
- okay, well, good night.
- good night.
- sleep tight.
- okay.
what a fucking nightmare.
richard, we-
we have to talk.
please.
sheryl, let's just
get through this and go home.
<i>no, richard, we have to talk now!</i>
<i>i tried to tell you
we couldn't afford this trip!</i>
<i>- do you realize we're becoming bankrupt?
- we are not bankrupt!</i>
<i>hey, don't listen to that.</i>
let's turn on the tube.
<i>- we agree that the right man to preserve
the traditions- - i'm gonna brush my teeth.</i>
secretary rumsfeld and i
thought long and hard...
<i>about this important choice.</i>
to me-
<i>you said this was a lock!
you said it was a done deal!</i>
<i>stan grossman said it was a done deal!</i>
<i>i'm not married to stan grossman!</i>
<i>i trusted him! you gotta trust
to be trusted! that's step six!</i>
<i>oh, fuck the nine steps, richard!</i>
<i>they're not working!
forget it! it's over!</i>
<i>i never want to hear
about the nine steps again!</i>
perfect. perfect. you're
the world champion growler.
time for your beauty rest.
get in there.
there you go.
good night.
<i>- grandpa?
- yeah.</i>
i'm kinda scared about tomorrow.
are you kiddin' me?
you're gonna blow 'em out of the water.
they're not gonna know
what hit 'em.
<i>- grandpa?
- yeah.</i>
am i pretty?
<i>olive, you are...</i>
the most beautiful girl
in the whole world.
nah, you're just saying that.
no, i'm not. i'm madly
in love with you.
and it's not because of your brains
or your personality.
it's because you're
beautiful, inside and out.
- grandpa?
- what?
- i don't want to be a loser.
- you're not a loser.
where'd you get the idea
you're a loser?
because daddy hates losers.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
back up a minute.
you know what a loser is?
a real loser is somebody that's so afraid
of not winning, they don't even try.
- now, you're trying, right?
- yeah.
well, then, you're not a loser.
we're gonna have fun tomorrow, right?
yeah.
we can tell 'em all to go to hell.
good night, sweetie.
i love you.
what are you doing?
i'm gonna fix this.
richard-
i'm gonna fix this.
here we go.
here we go.
hi.
hi. stan grossman, please.
stan, it's richard.
i don't know where the fuck you are.
i'm at the hotel.
call me.
but it's funny.
<i>so i said, "you want me to teach you
about life experiences?</i>
you can write a book
about my experiences. "
so he says to me-
hello, stan.
you're the one
that said it would sell!
that's what i thought at the time.
but it's a great program.
you said so yourself. i don't understand.
it's not the program, richard.
it's you. okay?
no one's heard of you.
nobody cares.
what's the next step?
there is none.
we had our shot.
it didn't fly.
we move on.
- you-you mean give up?
- richard.
hey, wh-whoa, hey! one setback here,
and you're ready to just quit?
richard, listen.
i pushed this thing hard, okay?
i rammed it down their fucking throats,
and no one bought it!
it's time to move on.
you're not gonna win this one.
okay. okay.
you know what?
good. i'm glad.
you know why?
because this is what
the nine steps are all about.
- right here, stan. right here!
- richard.
<i>- richard, please.
- you blew it!</i>
you blew it.
you're out.
<i>mom? dad?</i>
what is it, hon?
grandpa won't wake up.
want to take an eye test?
uncle frank?
an eye test?
olive, come here.
put those away.
we're gonna have a family meeting.
dwayne, family meeting.
first of all...
the doctors are doing everything they can
to help grandpa right now.
he's had a long, eventful life...
and i know he loves
both of you very much.
<i>but if god wants to take him,
we have to be ready to accept that, okay?</i>
<i>whatever happens,
we're a family.</i>
and what's important
is that we love each other.
i love you guys so, so much.
look at this.
this is a 15-pound turkey.
it does it in three hours' time.
are you the family of edwin hoover?
yes.
i'm sorry.
we did everything we could.
he was, uh-
well, it was too much.
he probably just fell asleep
and never woke up.
i'll have someone come talk to you
about handling the remains.
thank you.
linda!
mom?
is grandpa dead?
yeah, honey.
he passed away.
<i>that's what this
machine does. chicken, fish or beef.</i>
<i>so you always look forward
to eating the food.</i>
<i>and that, i believe-</i>
<i>put it in the machine.
center it. turn it around.</i>
hi. i'm your
bereavement liaison, linda.
- my consolations for your loss.
- thank you.
okay, these are the forms
you need to fill out.
a death certificate.
a report of death.
an m.e. pink slip.
please try and be
as detailed as possible.
um, this is a brochure...
for a grief recovery support
group that meets on tuesdays.
and, if you like, at this time,
i can refer you to a funeral home...
so you can begin making
your own arrangements.
actually, prearrangements
have already been made in albuquerque.
- albuquerque?
- we're actually on our way to california right now.
if the body is crossing state lines,
you're gonna need a burial transit permit.
okay, but we're trying
to get to redondo beach by 3:00.
ain't gonna happen.
okay, um, can i just-
i know that this is, uh-
this might be a little unusual...
but if maybe we could just go.
and then we'll come back, and we'll
take care of all the paperwork and-
no. you can't just abandon the body.
<i>no, no, no. nobody's gonna abandon
the body. we're gonna go and-</i>
otherwise, the hospital
becomes responsible.
<i>sir, there are ways
we have of doing things.</i>
we're gonna go and come back.
you are not the only one that's
had somebody die here today, okay?
is there any way we might
be able to view the remains?
we haven't had a chance
to move him downstairs...
so someone may come in in a few minutes
to take him to the basement.
just tell them who you are,
and they will wait.
- thank you.
- okay?
and when you're done with the paperwork,
i'll be at the nurses' station.
- great. thank you, linda.
- thank you.
goddamn it, dad.
goddamn it!
stupid.
we'll go to little miss sunshine
next year, okay, honey?
<i>next year.</i>
no. no.
we've come 700 miles.
i will be damned if i'm not
making that contest, sheryl.
well, richard,
we can't leave him here.
we're not gonna leave him.
- richard, what are you doing?
- fuck.
- dwayne, go around outside.
- richard, what are you thinking?
<i>- we're gonna take him with us.
- no, no. that is not happening.</i>
he's better off with us
that these people.
<i>i want you to go around outside
and underneath this window.</i>
<i>dwayne, don't you dare move.</i>
honey, you stay here.
we'll take olive. frank can drive.
no, sheryl, we'll be there in two hours.
i'll call a funeral home once we get there.
if there's one thing
my father would have wanted...
<i>it's to see olive perform
in the little miss sunshine pageant.</i>
<i>now, i believe we'd be doing
a grave disservice to his memory...</i>
if we were to just give up now.
all right? there's two kinds
of people in this world.
<i>there's winners and there's losers. okay?
you know what the difference is?</i>
winners don't give up.
so what are we here?
are we winners, or are we losers?
<i>huh?</i>
okay, okay, okay.
let's do it.
you guys go. olive,
you watch the curtain.
i don't know. i have no reason
to assume it's gonna be otherwise.
watch. get the back.
get the back.
shh. go, go, go.

<i>i'm ready.</i>

<i>ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the 24th annual...</i>
little miss sunshine pageant!
<i>yes!</i>
now, please, put your hands together once
again and help me welcome to the stage...
our 12 beautiful contestants!
wow.
<i>oh, let's have a big round of applause
for our lovely contestants!</i>
<i>at the end of the evening,
one of these girls...</i>
will be crowned
little miss sunshine!
<i>olive, honey,
are you okay in there?</i>
<i>yeah, i'm fine.</i>
hey.
what?
<i>you got a kid in the show?</i>
your first time?
yeah, yeah.
<i>america!</i>
<i>it's so beautiful!</i>
<i>sometimes i just wish
i could go to sleep till i was 18...</i>
and skip all this crap- high school
and everything-just skip it.
you know marcel proust?
- he's the guy you teach.
- yeah.
french writer.
total loser.
never had a real job.
unrequited love affairs. gay.
spent 20 years writing a book
almost no one reads.
but he's also probably
the greatest writer since shakespeare.
anyway, he, uh-
he gets down to the end of his life...
and he looks back and decides
that all those years he suffered-
those were the best years of his life,
'cause they made him who he was.
all the years he was happy? you know,
total waste. didn't learn a thing.
so, if you sleep until you're 18...
ah, think of the suffering
you're gonna miss.
i mean, high school? high school-
those are your prime suffering years.
you don't get better suffering
than that.
you know what?
fuck beauty contests.
life is one fucking
beauty contest after another.
you know, school,
then college, then work?
fuck that.
and fuck the air force academy.
if i wanna fly,
i'll find a way to fly.
you do what you love,
and fuck the rest.
i'm glad you're talkin' again, dwayne.
you're not nearly as stupid as you look.
wanna go back?
not really.
yeah, we should go back.
<i>and now, the moment
we've all been waiting for-</i>
the talent competition.
miss carly nugent.
yee-haw!
<i>yodel-lay-he-hoo, that was great!</i>
<i>wow-ow-ow-ow!</i>
<i>funky-licious!</i>
<i>i'm goin' backstage.</i>
yeah, right. see ya.
oh, look at you.
is that your costume?
mm-hmm.
okay, here.
- hey, what's goin' on?
- oh, i just- i came to wish olive good luck.
- how you doin', honey?
- good.
- nervous.
- yeah. you're gonna do great.
i just know it.
- can i talk to you for a second?
