my mind's a complete blank.
you know this place?
you know, this house.
no.

medical, biological reference books.
i mean...
from different countries, different periods in history.
they all relate to human or animal anatomy.

i can speak french.
i think this is your house.

sharon, you sure. i don't trust him.
i recall him!
someone is watching us.
what?
- i'm not just leaving her in there.
- we have to.
she was tied up for a reason.
it is inhumane.
she attacked you. did you
forget this. she's a crazy woman.
you're unbelievable.
- listen.
- what?
there is a camera in the shack,
we need to find the monitoring center.
only building we've seen so far is the house.
it's italian.
it means "a man with a lot of
keys has a lot of things to hide".
turns out, i know a few languages.
- congratulations.
- hmm.
"when they're all effect cometh the smile."
that's crazy.
we both know latin?
you know, i have the strongest feeling i know you.
- really?
- yeah.
yeah.
and i feel like i know sharon, too. i mean, not as
familiar as i feel with you, but it's there.
but then i keep thinking maybe she's my girlfriend.
or my sister. she could be my
sister and that'll be pretty gross.
you think she likes me?
i-i don't have time for this, okay?
i-i gotta get this door open.
try to find some tools, like a crowbar, or something.
get it in there and try and pry it open.
you're not gonna pry that open with a crowbar.
how do ya know? you haven't even tried.
no, that's a reinforced iron door, you're
not gonna get it open with a crowbar.
what about your keys?
where'd you get those keys, gendarme?
i found them.
where'd you find them?
downstairs. in a living room
with all the books you can read.
so, what's in here, nathan?
i see.
i'm not trying to make an enemy here, okay? it's just...
we can't bash the door in now.
everybody's tryin' to sleep.
it's been a long night.
i think you should get a couple of hours rest.
locked doors will still be here when you wake up.
- we need to find the cars
- i think he's got a point.
you know, you think he's got a point, mate. i wasn't here
when you had the meeting to make him boss. okay?
this time, no, i'm going with you.
you-you need me.
why?
why? because i'm the best shot.
how do we know?
jesus christ, michael.
- what the hell ?
- how 'bout that? you know now?
stay here and guard the house.
why won't they listen to me?
because of what you just did.
is he dead?
i hope so.
this fence must run the whole way around the house.
what's that smell. i can't handle it.
lukas?
somebody's put 'em all around the house.
maybe it's a warning.
the white knight.
i want 'em to listen to me.
no doubt...i could have helped them.
it is my job.
it comes...
it is my job.
how would i have this?
and who are you to me?
my wife? girlfriend?
if i knew what was going on, because it's...
i'm not like the others, they're all smart.
but i'm...i'm here to do something.
how do we know one other?
my quiet girl.
this thing between us...
it's important. i know it.

day 96, eh, this is subject 143,
who i captured in the woods.
he's the first positive result that i've had, and, eh,
he's responding to the injection, i believe.
it proves that i'm onto something.
and then, eh, one unfortunate side
effect is a period of unconsciousness.
followed by acute memory loss, but...
you don't remember anything.
...two stages that he's going...the
first stage is a rest cycle...he looks, eh,
...calm, almost dead...heartbeat
decreases to thirty beats per minute...
i don't know why it's wearing off so quickly...
i-i just...i need it to hold.
i need it to hold.
why is he not responding? it should work! it should work.
look, i'm trying everything.
her blood should...
now you can see...
it looks like...
something from in his head...
he's got increased strength.
do you remember your family?
i can't remember my mother, who
doesn't remember their own mother?
i know that i know you.
i feel like i know you.

come on, the soldiers are coming.
we need to hide. come on, come on.
hurry up, they're coming. come on, we gotta hide.
come on, come on. that's it.
there, that's it.
come on, come on.
shit! shit! shit! shit, shit, shit!
hang on. hang on.
i have to stop the bleeding.
look at me. they will find us.
okay. give me your arm,
- jonah?
- give me your arm. i need your arm.
we're just gonna hide.
and we'll pretend we're dead, then wake up, okay?
- jonah.
- yes.
jonah, listen to me.
- what is this?
- you have to read it.
jonah. remember this. read it.
this time, you have to do it right. please.
hey. i mean seriously.
please, you will tell them. don't forget.
please!
i love you.
i will never forget you.

- i know you.
i'm scared.
- i don't want to die.
- you won't die.
you won't die. this will work. i won't forget you.
i'm jonah.
my name is jonah.
unit 2, return back to base.
my love,
i remembered everything.
we were doctors on the verge of finding a cure
for an awful plague that has cast the world into darkness.
help me! please, help me!
the mute woman is the answer.
her blood is immune to the virus.
you must protect her.
you'll find death and madness everywhere.
and you have to fight to finish what we started.
we have no time, jonah.
there are still people waiting to be saved.
i know your memory will come back to you.
when it does...
remember i love you.
