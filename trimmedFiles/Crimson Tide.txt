reporting live for cnn...
from the french
aircraft carrier foch...
somewhere in the mediterranean.
six days ago,
as the rebellion in chechnya spread
to the neighboring caucas republics...
the russian president
ordered massive bombing strikes
against rebel positions...
around rutul and belokany.
appalled at the loss ofhuman life,
the president of the united states...
joined by the french president
and the british prime minister...
suspended all foreign aid to russia.
ultranationalist leader
vladimir radchenko...
denounced the u.s. pressure
as an act of war...
against the russian republic
and russian sovereignty.
denouncing his own president
as a u.s. puppet...
he called on the russian people
to join him in revolt.
he said, "this brutish and
hypocritical american intervention...
will not go unanswered."
on tuesday, at 10::00
in the morning moscow time...
the russian parliament was suspended
and martial law was declared.
with the government in crisis,
the russian republic...
was entering into what can only
be described as a state of civil war.
then yesterday at dawn,
radchenko and rebel forces...
seized the region
around vladivostok...
including a naval base and a nuclear
missile base housing russian icbms.
as regular russian military forces
move in to encircle radchenko...
allied military forces
are in a state ofhigh alert.
these french planes
taking off behind me...
have been deployed near the caucasus
since the beginning of the crisis.
and the crisis which started
in the caucasus...
has now spread to the far east...
and appears to be turning into the worst
standoff since the cuban missile crisis.

- abracadabra!
- i-i-i-i can't hear you.
abracadabra!
- ooh!
- oh, he shot fire!
- i need a volunteer...
- me! me!
- from the audience.
- uh, uh, me, me, me, me, me!
- me! me! me!
a brave volunteer.
me! me!
preferably... preferably
somebody who was born...
- on october 18,
- me! me! me!
- nineteen hundred and ninety.
- that's you, honey. that's you.
- me! me!
- me!
- over here? over here?
- ahh, you must be the birthday girl.
what's your name?
- robin.
- russian ultranationalist leader,
backed by his rebel army...
- stand up here on the chair.
- threatened nuclear attack
on the united states and japan.
- and turn around.
the threats come as a response
to the united states'
involvement in chechnya...
and are not considered idle.
now, sit on the board and tell me,
robin, do you believe in magic? good.
- because if you believe in magic...
- where'd he go?
- i'll get him. i'll get him.
- we can suspend you in the air...
- be right back.
- without the help of a flying carpet.
- meeting in an emergency session...
- come on. you'll miss
your daughter's levitation.
- while the president is sequestered...
with thejoint chiefs of staff.
that footage was taken yesterday,
but half an hour ago...
surrounded by hostile forces,
rebel leader vladimir radchenko...
- threatened to use nuclear arms...
- maybe it's not as bad as it looks.
on the united states and japan...
should anyone, including the russian
army, attempt to move in on him.
based on the history of this man,
this cannot be viewed as an idle threat.
- sander vanocur is standing by...
- it is.
commander hunter.
annapolis.
five patrols on fast attacks.
two on boomers: one as x.o.
hmm. ayear at...
excuse me. harvard.
i talked to your former c.o.
he tells me he tried to adopt you.
as you no doubt heard,
my x.o. has appendicitis.
he's the best i ever had.
i need a good man
to fill his spot.
- your name was at the top of the list.
- well, that's good to know, sir.
it was a short list.
your interests, mr. hunter.
what do you like to do? do you, uh...
do you paint, play ball, play an
instrument, ride motorcycles? wh-what?
- ride horses.
- horses.
- what's the best horse you ever rode?
- arabian, sir.
an arabian?
now, that's a powerful animal.
yes.
- you ever ridden one?
- who, me? are you kidding?
nah, i couldn't handle an arabian.
yeah, just give me an old paint.
yeah, horses are
fascinating animals.
dumb as fence posts
but very intuitive.
in that way, they're not too different
from high school girls.
they might not have a brain
in their head, but they do know
all the boys want to fuck 'em.
you don't have to be able
to read ulysses to know
where they're comin' from.
no, sir.
he approves of you.
jack russells.
smartest dogs alive.
name's bear.
goes every place with me.
well, welcome aboard
the alabama, son.
- do me proud.
- i will, sir.
- congratulations, mr. hunter.
- thank you.
if one russian citizen is killed,
and i am president...
then i will kill 900,000
of the people who are responsible.
- you'd use nuclear weapons?
- yes, i would hit them...
- attention!
- with nuclear weapons.
- at ease. be seated.
- sir, such talk is highly inflammatory.
my dear young lady,
i do not engage in "talk."
these are serious threats which i hope
to be in the position to carry out.
i take it you've seen enough?
gentlemen, after a nice little vacation,
looks like we're back at it again.
i hope you enjoyed the peace, because
as of now, we're back in business.
in the good old days
of the cold war, the russians
could always be depended on...
doing whatever was
in their own best interest.
but this radchenko's playing
a whole new ball game...
with a whole new set of rules.
now, i've heard people talk,
but i don't think this man's talking...
just to get his picture
in the paper.
he seems to have a serious weed
up his ass and a legitimate gripe.
always a dangerous combination.
and i think he's capable of doing every
damn thing he says he's going to do.
that's why we have to go out there
and give the man a moment of pause.
so ends theory.
thus, let us begin the facts.
we've been informed by the nsa
that an entire rebel corps
of the russian army is involved.
that's four armored divisions
numbering 60,000 men.
there seems to be
massive defections.
vladimir appears to be
winning the hearts and minds
of the russian soldiers.
admiral?
thank you.
they've seized the region by
the chinese and north korea borders.
that includes a submarine base...
from which they've surged
four akula-class attack subs.
they have acquired
a nuclear base at artem...
that houses 25 hardened silos
for russian icbms...
armed with up to
ten warheads apiece.
now, the russian government has
assured us that talks are under way.
they claim
that radchenko forces...
do not possess the launch codes.
but if radchenko
were to crack them...
they could launch against
our west coast direct...
or come in over the pole,
take out washington and new york.
the commander-in-chief has directed
u.s. military forces...
to set defcon four.
we've been ordered to get
under way at 0600 hours...
to assume alert coverage, mid-pacific,
the far eastern tvd target package.
please keep your men informed.
lieutenant commander hunter
is our new x.o.
please bring him up to speed on
ship's personnel and supplies. admiral?
- no, that's it.
- on your feet.
- holy shit.
- wow.
- here we go again, commander.
- thank you.
you bet. hey, bobby.
this is bobby dougherty, supplies.
- pleasure to meet you.
- mr. dougherty.
- billy linkletter, tso.
- hey.
- mr. linkletter.
- commander.
- and, uh, you know darik.
- yes. westergaurd.
- hey.
- long time no see.
- yeah. how's julia?
- she's excellent.
- good.
- and, uh, roy zimmer, communications.
- mr. zimmer.
- welcome aboard.
- thank you.
- uh, we served together
on the baton rouge.
- twice.
that's right.
and, uh, we're lucky to have him.
i think his dog gave me
the final seal of approval.
he's crazy about that dog.
takes him everywhere.
the navy looks the other way
'cause he's ramsey.
the navy looks the other way 'cause
he's one of the few skippers left...
- who've actually seen some combat.
- hey, he took seals into panama in '89.
- tomahawks in the gulf in '91.
- took out what? eight or nine
x.o. s in '94?
- ouch.
- last one caught...
what was it? appendicitis?
yeah, right.
the enemy below.
- robert mitchum.
- and?
- and what? robert mitchum.
- incomplete answer.
- what, the german guy
with the white hair?
- yeah. what's his name?
- who was it?
- curt jurgens.
- no.
right over there!
bye-bye. i love you!
- hardy kruger.
- no way.
robert shaw in his nazi period.
question is invalid.
we're even.
- how you doin'?
- hi. i'm fine. thanks.
- good.
address me as "sir" when you speak
to me! stand at attention, sailor!
- is he gonna fit in the sub?
- doubtful.
who played the german sub commander
in the enemy below with robert mitchum?
- was it curtjurgens or hardy kruger?
- sir?
wrong answer!
drop down and give me 20! now!
- move! move!
- one. two.
- run silent, run deep.
- three.
- the guy with the ears...
- four.
- and the little moustache.
- five.
- cary grant.
i'm worried about t.
- why?
- she doesn't know what's goin' on.
i think she thinks
i'm goin' away forever.
i'll take care of her.
- you will?
- yeah.
- you promise?
i promise.
- i love you, dad.
- i love you too, son.
okay. um.
- you know i don't know what to say.
- just say good-bye.
see you in my dreams.
give me a kiss.
mmm.
- davis.
- how you doin', sir?
crew present
and accounted for, sir!
little ducks...
there's trouble in russia.
so they called us.
and we're going over there...
and bringing the most lethal
killing machine ever devised.
we're capable of launching
more firepower...
than has ever been released
in the history of war.
for one purpose alone:
to keep our country safe.
we constitute the front line...
and the last line of defense.
i expect and demand...
your very best.
anything less, you should have
joined the air force.
this might be our
commander-in-chief's navy...
but this is my boat.
and all i ask is that
you keep up with me.
and if you can't...
that strange sensation you'll be
feeling in the seat of your pants...
will be my boot in your ass!
- mr. cob?
- yes, sir!
you're aware of the name
of this ship, aren't you, mr. cob?
very aware, sir!
- it bears a proud name,
doesn't it, mr. cob?
- very proud, sir!
- it represents fine people.
- very fine people, sir!
- who live in a fine, outstanding state.
- outstanding, sir!
in the greatest country
in the entire world.
in the entire world, sir!
- and what is that name, mr. cob?
- alabama, sir!
- and what do we say? go, 'bama.!
- go, 'bama.!
roll tide!
chief of the boat,
dismiss the crew.
dismiss the crew.
aye, aye, sir!
crew! department heads!
attend to your departments!
fall out!
here.
part of your qualification
for command.
ahh.
my last breath of polluted air
for the next 65 days.
gonna miss it.
i don't trust air i can't see.
this is my favorite part.
right here, right now.
bravo, hunter.
sir?
you knew to shut up
and enjoy the view.
most eggheads want to
talk it away.
your stock just went up
a couple of points.
thank you, sir.
allow me to give you
a tiny bit of advice.
if you want your own boat
some day...
the very worst thing you can do is worry
about yourself or try to impress me.
i can't stand save-asses,
and i won't abide kiss-asses.
you keep your priorities straight:
your mission and your men.
how do you like that cigar?
- it's good, sir.
- it's your first.
- yeah.
don't like it too much.
they're more expensive than drugs.
- x.o., take her down.
- take her down. aye, sir.
control/bridge: sounding.
bridge/control: :
sounding 130 fathoms.
- lookouts, clear the bridge.
- clear the bridge. aye, sir.
officer of the deck,
prepare to dive.
- captain's down.
- captain is down.
- x.o. down.
- x.o. is down.
- submerge the ship.
- diving officer, submerge the ship.
- make your depth 150 feet.
- make my depth 150 feet. aye, sir.
chief of the watch,
on the 1 mc, dive, dive!
make your depth 150 feet.
five degree down bubble.
- i don't understand.
- what don't you understand?
radchenko is a fanatic, okay?
he's a potential hitler.
- somebody should just
step up and shoot him.
- i have no problem with that.
- good.
- well, it's fanatics who make history.
- hell, patton was a fanatic.
- it's what made him great.
you think this guy is patton?
he's a dangerous lunatic and
he's threatening nuclear war,
and he means it.
what's that make us,
since we're the only nation
to ever drop a nuclear bomb on anyone?
it makes us a prime target.
i mean, there's half a dozen other
third world countries with atom bombs...
- who'd love to drop one on us.
- that's right. that's why
we should drop one on them.
what are you, a communist?
you have a problem with us
dropping nuclear bombs on japan?
shut up, dougherty.
- you think it was a mistake, mr. hunter?
- sir?
using the bomb
on hiroshima and nagasaki.
well, if i thought that, sir,
i wouldn't be here.
- interesting way you put that.
- how'd i put it, sir?
very carefully.
you do qualify your remarks.
if somebody asked me
if we should have bombed japan...
a simple "yes, by all means,
sir, drop that fucker. twice."
i don't mean to suggest
that you're indecisive, mr. hunter.
not at all.
just, um, complicated.
of course, that's the way
the navy wants you.
me, they wanted simple.
well, you certainly
fooled them, sir.
be careful there, mr. hunter.
it's all i got to rely on:
bein' a simpleminded son of a bitch.
rickover gave me
my command, a checklist...
a target and a button to push.
all i had to know is how to push it.
they'd tell me when.
they seem to want you to know why.
i would hope they'd want us
all to know why, sir.
at the naval war college,
it was metallurgy and nuclear reactors,
not 19th-century philosophy.
"war is a continuation
of politics by other means."
von clausewitz.
i think, uh, sir, that
what he was actually trying
to say was a little more...
complicated?
y-yes, the purpose of war is,
is to serve a political end...
- but the true nature of war
is to serve itself.
- i'm very impressed.
in other words, the sailor
most likely to win the war...
is the one most willing to part
company with the politicians...
and ignore everything except
the destruction of the enemy.
- uh, you'd agree with that?
- well...
i'd agree that, uh...
that's what clausewitz
was trying to say.
- but you wouldn't agree with it?
- no, sir, i do not.
no, l-i just think
that in the nuclear world...
the true enemy can't be destroyed.
attention on deck.
von clausewitz will now tell us
exactly who the real enemy is.
von?
in my humble opinion...
in the nuclear world,
the true enemy is war itself.
everywhere i go
your face i see
every step i take
you take with me
- nowhere to run to, baby
- nowhere to run, baby
nowhere to hide

i know you're no good for me
but free of you
i'll never be, baby

- aye, sir.
man battle stations missiles

spin up all missiles.
this is an exercise.
captain's in control!
i agree. the message
is properly formatted.
sir, we have a properly

- i concur, sir.

- very well. commence hovering.
- commence hovering. aye, sir.
control/sick bay: chief petty officer
marichek is undergoing cardiac arrest.
- we're beginning cpr.
- chief of the watch, on the 1 mc.
gentlemen, may i have
your attention, please?
we've received word that one
of our shipmates is experiencing
a medical problem.
we're terminating the drill. mr.
mahoney, take the conn. i'm going below.
- x.o.
- aye, sir. i have the conn.
clear.
clear.
it's okay, chief.
thank you, sir. sorry, sir.
hiya, boy. hiya, hiya, hiya.
how ya doin'? oh, boy. yeah.
so, mr. hunter, do you think
i was wrong to run that drill?
- not necessarily, sir.
- do you think i got that man killed?
no, sir. one thing had nothing to do
with the other. it was an accident.
- would you have run the drill?
- no, sir, i wouldn't have.
why not?
the fire in the galley could
have flared back up. i would
have seen to it first, sir.
i'm sure you would have.
me, on the other hand,
i tend to think that that's
the best time to run a drill.
confusion on the ship
is nothing to fear.
it should be taken
advantage of.
lest you forget, mr. hunter, we are
a ship of war, designed for battle.
you don't just fight battles
when everything is hunky-dory.
what'd you think, son?
i was just some crazy old coot...
putting everyone in harm's way
as i yelled "yee-haw"?
that was not
my first thought, sir.
but there's no excuse. at the time
i was fighting the fire in the galley...
i did not agree
with your call, sir.
take a seat.
just so we understand
each other...
i don't have any problems
with questions or doubts.
as i said to you before, i'm not
seeking the company of kiss-asses.
when you got something to say to me,
you say it in private.
and if privacy doesn't permit itself,
then you bite your fucking tongue.
- are we clear about that, commander?
- as a bell, sir.
those sailors out there
are just boys...
boys who are training to do
a terrible and unthinkable thing.
and if that ever occurs,
the only reassurance they'll have...
that they're doing
the proper thing...
is gonna derive from their unqualified
belief in the unified chain of command.
that means we don't question each
other's motives in front of the crew.
it means we don't
undermine each other.
it means in a missile drill...
they hear your voice
right after mine, without hesitation.
- do you agree with that policy, sailor?
- absolutely, sir.
we're here to preserve democracy,
not to practice it.
there'll be a memorial service in
the enlisted men's mess at 1100 hours.
- go see to it.
- aye, aye, sir.
oh, hunter.
short of the outbreak
of world war iii...
the ship sinking or being
attacked by a giant octopus...
- i'd like to be undisturbed
for the next 30 minutes.
- i'll see to it, sir.
by the way, it was marichek's
not the fire.
dismissed.
one, two, three, four.
jab. jab.
one, two. one, two.
- you okay?
- yeah, i'm fine.
does it make any sense to you to start
a drill in the middle of a fire?
- fire was out, wasn't it?
- yeah, and a man died too.
- not 'cause of what the captain did.
- what?
- not 'cause of what the captain did.
- weps.
a fire is a serious threat to the ship.
now, where was he?
why didn't he check it out first, huh?
that's his style.
he's a hard-ass.
- so what?
- so you wanna fight him, go ahead.
you wanna get along, you gotta get
to understand him a little bit.
two schools of thought here.
to him, you're annapolis,
harvard...
- expert on theory,
well-versed in world affairs.
- ha!
he's had his head up his ass
drivin' ships for the last 25 years.
he's probably a little
paranoid about that.
i mean, navy's all he's got.
navy and that little
rat-dog of his.
that's why his wife left him.
so what are you saying?
i'm just sayin' watch out,
give him a little room.
let him get to know you.
you do pants too?
conn/radio: receiving
emergency action message.
recommend alert one.
recommend alert one.
alert one! alert one!
incoming emergency action message!
alert one. alert one.
incoming eam.
captain.
captain has asked me
to brief you on the emergency
action message we just received.
as you know,
before we got under way...
the russian army was in position
and circling the rebel camps...
and radchenko started making extravagant
threats should anyone move in on him...
that he would launch his
land-based nuclear weapons at
the united states and atjapan.
the only safeguard was
that the russian government
controlled the launch codes.
intel now indicates that those
launch codes have been compromised.
and u.s. military forces
have been directed to set defcon three.
the last time we hit this state of
emergency was 32-and-a-half years ago...
during the cuban missile crisis.
so this is what it's all about,
gentlemen. it's what we've trained for.
captain.
the nca has determined that...
should our satellites detect
rebel missiles being fueled...
which means they could be
launched in just over one hour...
we'll be compelled to act.
now, given our patrol sector
here in the emperor sea mounts...
it seems clear that
our friends in the pentagon...
are setting us up for
a potential preemptive strike.
it's important to remain focused.
keep your men informed.
any questions?
dismissed.
we lost that frying unit,
and then, uh, we...
we can't get the same capacity
in here any more.
- i'm gonna fuck you up!
- get out! get...
- get out of here, man! get him out!
- motherfucker!
- fuckin' dirty piece of shit!
- bennefield, you crazy, man?
- whoa.
- all right.
- rivetti, what's up?
- i'm sorry, sir.
- it's just a difference
of opinion that got out of hand.
- what about?
it's really too silly to talk about,
sir. i'd rather just forget about...
i don't give a damn about
what you'd rather forget about.
why were you two fighting?
well, i said that the kirby
silver surfer was the only
real silver surfer...
and that the moebius
silver surfer was shit.
and bennefield's
a big moebius fan, and, uh...
things got out of hand.
i pushed him: he pushed me.
- i lost my head, sir. i'm sorry.
- rivetti, you're a supervisor.
you can get a commission
like that.
i know it, sir.
you're 100 percent right.
- uh, it'll never happen again,
all right?
- it better not happen again.
i see this kind of nonsense,
i'm gonna write you up. you
understand? do you understand?
- yes, sir.
- you have to set an example
even in the face of stupidity.
everybody that reads comic books
knows that kirby's silver surfer
is the only true silver surfer.
- now, am i right or wrong?
- y... you're right, sir.
- all right. get out of here.
- yes, sir.
- captain.
- how can i help you?
test results
from the missile drill.
- this the best they can do?
- no, sir, but that's what they did.
- i want this down to
five minutes. train on it.
- yes, sir.
you tell your buddy weps
we're gonna do it again.
we're gonna keep on doing it
until he gets it right. damn.
feels like the whole crew
needs a kick in the ass.
or a pat on the back, sir.
i just witnessed a fight
down in crew's mess. no big deal, but...
i think the men are...
a little on edge with
all we're going through.
morale seems to be a bit low.
well, you seem to have
the pulse of the men.

gentlemen, this is the captain.
we have an akula-class
submarine out there.
we know that radchenko controls
at least four submarines.
this could be one of them.
russian rebels have threatened
a launch against our country...
and are fueling right now.
they will have launch
capability in 60 minutes.
we also have orders to launch
our missiles, which is exactly
what we're going to do.
we are rigging for ultra-quiet.
all hands be ready.
this is as real as it gets.
we'll presume nothing,
defend ourselves at all cost.
if that sub so much as comes
around or opens up a tube door,
we're gonna take her out.

but we're too deep to receive
any radio communication, sir.
- captain.
- x.o.
we got a limited radio transmission
indicating an incoming eam.
- we need to go shallow
to reestablish communications.
- with that sub still up there?
mr. hunter, it's my inten...
- come up to the conn, mr. hunter.
- yes, sir.

- attention, all hands.
- ship has been rigged for ultra-quiet.
- captain?
when our missile system is ready,
mr. hunter, it is my intention...
to rise to launch depth,
launch our birds and then
get the hell out of there.
not until then.
- i can't jeopardize
the safety of this ship.
- yes, sir.
may i suggest that we float the buoy,
sir? we have enough cable.
that should give us enough reach
to receive the eam transmission, sir.
very well. float the buoy.
- chief of the watch, float the buoy.
- float the radio buoy. aye, sir.

mr. zimmer, where's that eam?
- you all right, son?
- yes, sir.
- i got it.
- that's it?
- uh, uh-huh. it's incomplete, sir.
- we lost it when the radio
buoy cable got severed.
- all right.
all right, gentlemen, let's
get on with it. all ahead one-third.
steady as you go.
all ahead one-third.
steady. aye, sir.
make your depth 150 feet.
zero bubble.
up slow and silent to launch depth.
up slow and silent
to launch depth. aye, aye, captain.
captain? got the eam.
- what do you think?
- i think there's nothing on this.
yes, sir. it, uh,
it got cut off during the attack.
then it's meaningless.
- sir, this is an eam pertaining
to nuclear missile launch.
- no, mr. hunter.
- that's a message fragment.
- because it got cut off
during the attack, sir.
the message could mean anything.
it could be a message to abort.
- it could be a message that...
- it could be a fake russian
transmission.
which is exactly why
we need to confirm, sir.
- all i'm asking for is the time
we need to get back on line.
- calm down, mr. hunter.
- i am calm.
- you don't appear to be calm.
conn/weapons: : missile systems
ready to launch in four minutes.
- step aside, seaman.
- yes, sir.
we have orders in hand, and those orders
are to make a preemptive launch.
every second that we lose
increases the chances that
by the time our missiles arrive...
their silos could be empty
'cause they've flown
their birds and struck us first.
- yes, sir.
- you know as well as i do
that any launch order...
received without authentication
is no order at all.
- ye... captain...
- that's our number-one rule.
- national mili...
that rule is the basis for the scenario
we've trained on time and time again.
- yes, sir.
- it's a rule we follow
without exception.
captain, national military command
center knows what sector we're in.
they have satellites looking down on us
to see if our birds are aloft...
and if they're not then
they give our orders to somebody else.
that's why we maintain more than one
sub. it's what they call "redundancy."
- i know about redundancy, mr. hunter.
- all i'm saying...
all i'm saying, captain,
is that we have backup.
now, it's our duty not to launch
until we can confirm.
you're presuming that we have other
submarines out there ready to launch.
well, as captain i must assume
that our submarines could've
been taken out by other akulas.
we can play these games all night,
mr. hunter, but i don't have
the luxury of your presumptions.
- sir...
- mr. hunter, we have rules that
are not open to interpretation...
personal intuition,
gut feelings...
hairs on the back of your neck,
little devils or angels
sitting on your shoulders.
- captain...
- we're all very well aware
of what our orders are...
and what those orders mean.
they come down from
our commander-in-chief.
they contain no ambiguity.
- captain...
- mr. hunter, i've made the decision.
i'm captain of this boat.
now shut the fuck up!
damn.
weapons/conn:
shift targeting...
to target package slbm 64741/2.
this is the captain.
- captain, i cannot concur.
- repeat my command.
sir, we don't know what this
message means. our target
package could have changed.
you repeat this order
or i'll find somebody who will!
- hell, no, you won't, sir.
- you're relieved of your position.
- cob, remove mr. hunter
from the control room.
get lieutenant zimmer in here right now!
- no, sir. no, sir.
no, sir, i do not concur and i do not
recognize your authority to relieve me
on the command under navy regulations.
- cob, arrest this man
and get him out of here!
- captain ramsey...
under the operating procedures governing
the release of nuclear weapons...
- we cannot launch our missiles
unless both you and i agree.
- cob!
- what are you waiting for?
- now, this is not a formality, sir!
this is expressly why
your command must be repeated.
it requires my assent.
i do not give it.
and furthermore,
you continue upon this course...
- and insist upon this launch without
confirming this message first...
- son of a bitch!
- i will be forced...
- chief of the boat!
- backed by the rules of precedents...
- as captain
and commanding officer...
- authority and command...
- of the uss alabama, i order you...
- regulation 08150h6...
- to place the x.o. under arrest
on the charge of mutiny!
- of the navy regulations...
- i say again, i order you
to place the x.o. under arrest...
- to relieve you of command, captain!
on the charge of mutiny!
- cob!
- captain, please. the x.o. is right.
we can't launch unless he concurs.
"to the uss alabama: :
rebel controlled missiles
being fueled.
launch codes compromised.
dissidents threaten launch
at continental united states.
set defcon 2.
immediately launch
ten trident missile sorties."
they're fueling their missiles!
we don't have time to fuck around!
sir, i think you need time
to think this over.
i don't have to think this over!
captain, i relieve you
of your command of this ship.
cob, escort the captain
to his stateroom.
- i'm assuming command.
- you're not assuming anything.
chief of the boat,
captain ramsey's under arrest!
- lock him in his stateroom.
- captain, please...
- now, cob!
- aye, sir.
mitchell. walker.
take the captain below.
you're way out
of your league, hunter.
you're not ready to make
tough decisions yet.
what the hell are we waitin' for?
anybody here disagrees
with what i've done...
then you feel free to
relieve yourself of duty now.
anybody?
all right.
- all stations.
- aye, sir.
this is the executive officer.
i've assumed command of
this ship under authority
granted me by navy regulations.
i have relieved
captain ramsey ofhis duties...
for acting in contravention
of the rules and regulations...
regarding nuclear weapons release.
it is my intention
to delay the missile launch...
maintaining our current
state of readiness...
pending confirmation of
an emergency action message
that was cut off during the attack.
remain at battle stations missile.
carry on.
- what the hell are we doin', fred?
- i don't know about you,
but i'm pissin' my pants.
come on, boy.
conn/weapons: russians
will have missile launch capability...
in 39 minutes.
chief of the boat.
sir?
- thank you, cob.
- "thank you"?
fuck you. get it straight, mr. hunter.
i'm not on your side.
now, you could be wrong.
but wrong or right, the captain
can't just replace you at will.
that was completely improper,
and that's why i did what i did.
- by the book.
- i thank you anyway.
radio/conn: mr. zimmer, get
those communications back on line now.
we're working on it, sir.
aye, aye, captain.
- are you ready?
- uh, ready. go.
- jesus christ.
- fuckin' thing.
- come on. this whole system is crashed.
- radio buoy is severed.
what the fuck does he want us to do?
- shit electrons?
- hey, vossler, we need communications,
not smart-ass remarks.

- chief of the watch to maneuvering,
give me max speed now!
- maximum speed. aye, sir!
sonar/conn: let me know when our range
to that akula is open to 1,000 yards!
- conn/sonar: aye, sir!
- goddamn it, let's just shoot
this fucker. what's 1,000 yards for?
'cause it takes 1,000 yards
for the torpedoes to arm. jesus,
who'd you fuck to get on this ship?
conn/sonar: torpedoes 150 yards

passing 1,650 feet.
- what the fuck's going on?
- take it easy!
conn/bilge bay:
flooding has recommenced!
it looks like three men
are trapped!
bilge bay/conn: try and
get those men out of there
as soon as you can and seal that bay.
sir, if we don't seal
the bilge bay now, we'll lose the ship.
bilge bay/conn:
can you get the men out?
sir, there's no fuckin' way!
if i go down there, i'll never get out!
barnes, come on! you gotta come!
move.! move.! barnes, come on, come on.!
you can do it.! move it.!
bilge bay/conn: seal that bay.

- step aside, tommy.
- i'm sorry, sir.
- the x.o. ordered us...
- fuck the x.o.!
the ship has been hit,
and i'm going in to see my captain.
now stand aside.
stand aside!
captain.
- sir.
- how bad is it, mr. dougherty?
it's bad, sir.
i've just been looking
at hunter's file here.
closest to combat he's been
is a policy seminar.
give me an order, sir.
as quietly as you can, you get
to mr. zimmer and mr. westergaurd.
- how about linkletter?
- nah, you won't be able to talk
to the tso. he's at the conn.
but you can get to weps.
we gotta have weps. he's the key.
you get me those men, a small security
force, then come back and get me.
- aye, sir.
- don't get overzealous now
and try to recruit the whole ship.
- we'll lead from the top down.
- aye, sir. right away.
radio's 50 percent.
can i talk to you
in the passageway?
right now, pete. come on.
- what's goin' on?
- we're not gonna let this go down
with the x.o. at the helm.
- we're not?
- no, we're not.
- i been with the captain for years...
and this asshole hunter shows up,
and i'm supposed to follow him
'cause he says so?
you're not supposed to:
you've been ordered to.
that's what this is about:
proper orders.
proper orders? he has proper orders.
he won't act on them.
he's in command now!
if they order him to launch, we'll
launch, and we'll blow 'em all to hell.
but i'd rather go down myself
than get this one wrong.
look, our procedures are clear.
in the absence of a contravening order,
in a situation like this,
we follow the orders in hand.
exactly. you know how many checks
we go through to make sure
a launch order is authentic?
the x.o. agreed
with those orders.
now he just wants to throw them away?
they don't count?
- he's lost his nerve.
- bullshit!
- i know this guy, bobby!
- you...
- weps, we've been ordered to launch.
now, why in the world would
we do that if they weren't
prepared to launch at us?
we don't know that for sure!
that's the whole point!
that's why he wants time
to confirm the message.
that's the whole fucking point
is we don't have time!
radchenko is fueling his birds. now,
why do you think he's doing that? why?
you don't put on a condom
unless you're gonna fuck.
- go back to your station.
- excuse me.
- go back to your station and stay there.
come on, man.
peter, think about
your family, man.
i am. i am!
i mean, what do you...
what do you plan to do?
nothing without you.
you're senior officer department head.
- the tso's with hunter.
- and you have the keys
to the small arms locker.
now, we wanna recruit
a few more men, and then
we're gonna open up that arsenal.
i just talked to the captain
in his room.
he specifically asked for you.
he says we cannot go without you.
i don't believe this.
this is a mutiny, peter.
there's only two sides to a mutiny.
now, your captain
is asking for your help.
what are you gonna do?
what are you gonna do?
all right.
conn/weapons: russian missiles will
have launch capability in 24 minutes.
you're doing the right thing.
electrical power
has been restored.
all stations prepare
to reinitiate the system.
radio/conn: mr. zimmer,
what's the status on that radio repair?
conn/radio: all systems are still down,
sir. lieutenant zimmer isn't here.
- where is he?
- i don't know, sir.
very well.
mr. mahoney has the conn.
- aye, sir. i have the conn.
- cob.
- sir.
- send a man to find zimmer.
- aye, sir.
- get a side arm.
- aye, aye, sir.
- chief young.
- aye, chief.
turn around! move it!
at ease, sailor.
- sir.
- thank you, mr. ince.
- mr. westergaurd.
- sir.
- mr. zimmer.
- ready, sir.
let's get on with it.
stand guard.
all you people
return to your stations!
- mr. rivetti.
- sir?
- follow me, please.
- yes, sir.
is there a problem, sir?
these are the keys
to the entire submarine.
conn/weapons:
russian missiles will have
launch capability in 21 minutes.
who's in charge here?
shit!
me, sir. oh, fuck.
- how long is it gonna take?
- i don't know, sir.
- do you know what's going on here?
- yes, sir.
no, i don't think you do.
let me explain it to you.
if we launch and we're wrong, what's
left of russia is gonna launch at us.
there will be a nuclear
holocaust beyond imagination.
so it's all about knowing,
mr. vossler.
we have to know whether or not our order
to launch has been recalled or not.
the only way we're gonna know is if
you fix that radio. you understand me?
yes, sir.
you ever watch star trek?
- yeah, of course i seen star trek.
- star trek. you know, star trek.
- the uss enterprise.
- yeah.
- the whole... all right.
you remember when the klingons
were gonna blow up the enterprise...
and captain kirk calls down
to scotty. he says, "scotty,
i gotta have more power."
- he needs more, more warp speed.
- warp speed. exactly.
- yeah.
well, i'm captain kirk,
you're scotty. i need more power.
i'm telling you,
if you do not get this radio up,
a billion people are gonna die.
now it's all up to you.
i know that's a shitty deal,
but you got it. can you handle it?
scotty.
aye, captain.
- you got anything?
- no, vossler.
- then get on it.
- i have the conn.
- x.o. has the conn.
chief of the boat,
make your depth 75 feet.
- continue up the periscope depth.
- belay that order!
- get up!
- jesus.
okay, okay.
any of you officers or chiefs
feel you've been unjustly
caught up in this thing...
you stand with me now.
sir, propulsion
has been restored.
all flooding has been contained.
all communications
are still down.
take them away. lock them up
in the officers' mess.

sir.
i didn't know that.
but they are from portugal.
- come on, vossler. come on.
- yes! yes!
come on. come on. you got it.
some of the things they do,

their training program
is simplicity itself.
you just stick a cattle prod

simple matter of voltage.
you're gonna get it. come on.
- i almost had it. you saw it.

- message is authentic, captain.
- i concur, sir.
- i concur, sir.
- message is authentic.
crew of the alabama,
this is the captain.
set condition 2sq.
terminate launch, all missiles.
all right! all right!
mr. hunter has the conn.
in the early hours of this morning,
russian army forces moved in...
and met surprisingly
little resistance.
there were some
sporadic battles...
but, apparently, the specter
of fighting their countrymen...
proved too much for these rebel troops,
and they surrendered quickly.
and so a crisis that seemed
to be escalating beyond
the point of no return...
was ultimately resolved with fewer
than a hundred soldiers dead.
and the nuclear base
captured by radchenko
is now back in government hands.
reporting live from the french aircraft
carrier foch in the mediterranean sea...
this is richard valeriani
for cnn.
all right, stand there, uh, lieutenant
commander hunter. this won't take long.
this panel has convened in order
to investigate the events...
subsequent to the setting of condition
on board the uss alabama
on 1 november.
now, based on the testimony
from personnel on board the alabama...
and, in no small measure, to that
of the senior officer, captain ramsey...
i'm prepared to make
my recommendations to subpac.
- without my testimony, sir?
- you have a problem with that?
- i might, sir.
- i have known captain ramsey
for almost 30 years.
we served together
on more than a few occasions.
if he is lying,
this will be the first i've heard of it.
yes, sir.
my primary concern here
is the breakdown in the system.
in this instance,
the system failed...
because the two senior officers did not
work to resolve their differences...
while preserving
the chain of command.
now, you may have been
proven right, mr. hunter...
but insofar as the letter
of the law is concerned...
you were both right.
and you were also both wrong.
this is the dilemma that will
occupy this panel, this navy...
and this country's armed forces
as a whole...
long after you leave this room.
off the record...
you've both created
one hell of a mess.
a mutiny aboard
a united states nuclear submarine...
violation of nuclear
launch protocol.
for the record, it is
the conclusion of this panel...
that your actions
aboard the alabama...
were consistent with
the best traditions of the navy...
and in the interests
of the united states.
as such, the recommendations
of this panel will be to accept...
in a manner reflective of his long
and dedicated service to his country...
captain ramsey's request
for early retirement from active duty.
and based, in no small part,
on captain ramsey's recommendation...
that lieutenant commander hunter
be given his next command...
at the earliest
possible convenience.
unless, of course, you wish
to challenge these recommendations.
no, sir.
- captain ramsey?
- no, sir.
dismissed.
captain?
just wanted to say thank you.
you were right,
and i was wrong.
about the horses, the lipizzaners.
they are from spain, not portugal.
yes, sir.
