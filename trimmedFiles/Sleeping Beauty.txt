after we'd been to andy's place,
that moment.
i wanted to kiss you.
you must have wanted me to kiss you.
i couldn't because of my tongue.
my tongue was furred.
furred and thick.
putrid.
the asshole, of the asshole,
of the asshole.
i couldn't kiss you.
that's ok.
i wanted you to know.
i just want to love my friends.

thank you friends for coming
here tonight.
as ever, it is wonderful to see you.
this evening we're serving
beluga caviar with toasted brioche.
service.
galantine of quail stuffed with black truffle
on the nest of fried leek and herbs.
curious choice.
i first tried that dish
many years ago.
on the occasion of my 20th
wedding anniversary.
but tonight, i've asked my chef
to do what he can...
to bring it back to life.
perhaps you'll be able to tell me
whether it really does taste so good.
or if it is the memories of elizabeth
and that night that make it so special.
to the dish itself.
to the dish.
to memories.
- brandy?
- thank you.
such fair skin.
brandy?
thank you.
not to worry.
upsy daisy.

- just this once.
- thank you.
it gets a bit easier.
it's never easy, though.

doing it for?
what kind of a question
is that?
i'm sorry.
- thanks.
- no problem.
may 1?
yeah, be my guest.
some people fake their deaths.
i'm faking my life.

i'm ready, i think.
i think i'm nearly ready.
we can get you back into detox.
i could, i'm flush.
thank you.
i don't think i'd make it
this time.
you could.
do you believe that?
i don't know.
sandhill dunnart.
nocturnal and endangered.
a marsupial mouse.
thought to be extinct
until recently.
its main predators include
owls and bats.
little is known about the animal
due to its rarity.
first they eat insects but
will also eat meat on occasion.
sharp, carnivore's teeth.
scared, sandhill dunnart will make
a loud noise...
as it moves into an
offensive position.
what it really is...
the sandhill dunnart...
is a miniature, a more
tenacious kangaroo.
hi, thomas. no time, no hear.
i'd be happy to do what i can,
try me.
sorry?
for how long?
that's it?
how much?
ok yes. yeah, i understand.
ok. bye.
- hey.
- good afternoon.
come in. come through.
welcome to my home.
i hope the trip wasn't too grueling.
- no, it was fine. thank you.
- wonderful.
perhaps you'd like a shower
to refresh you after your long drive.
there's a bathroom at the end
of the corridor on the right.
you'll find a robe behind the door.
oh, and try not to let your
hair get wet.
sure.
i'm ready.
- are you feeling well?
- pardon?
are you in good health?
yeah, i'm fine.
you're going to sleep
and wake up.
it'd be as if these hours
never existed.
you won't even dream.
for an hour or two after you wake
you'll feel, yes, slightly...
groggy, but then fine.
perfectly fine.
not nearly as bad as a hangover.
such a sleep works wonders.
you'll feel...
profoundly restored.
thank you, clara.
a few months ago,
a strange thing happened.
i was idling through my bookshelves,
when i noticed a book...
my brother's once given me
for my birthday.
a collection of short stories.
well, i started to reread
one of those stories.
it was about a man who one morning
wakes up and cannot...
bring himself to get out of bed.
he shuts his eyes is self defense.
he reexamines his life.
he's seized with a restlessness.
he packs his bags, cuts all ties, he can
no longer live among the people he knows.
they paralyze him.
he's monied, he goes to rome.
he wants to burrow under the earth
like a bulb, like a root.
but even in rome he cannot escape
people from his former life.
so, he decides to return to the city
where he was born and educated...
but which he can't quite
bring himself to call home.
well, the move doesn't help.
he feels he has no more right
to return than a dead man.
what can he do? he desires an extreme
solution to his conundrum.
he aches for nothing less than
a new world, a new language.
nothing changes.
out of indifference, and because he
can't think of anything better to do...
he decides once more to
leave his hometown, to do some hitching.
a man picks him up, they ride off into the
night when bang, the car smacks into a wall.
the driver dies, our man
is hospitalized, broken up.
months pass, his wounds heal.
now he wishes for life.
he has a confidence in himself,
in things he doesn't have to explain.
things like the pores in his skin,
all things corporeal.
he can't wait to get out of the hospital,
away from the infirm and the moribund.
"i say unto thee, rise up and walk.
none of your bones are broken".
the end.
when i reread those words "rise up and walk.
none of your bones are broken"...
i felt a tremendous sadness.
do you know what the opening
line of the story is?
"when a man enters his 30th year
people will not stop calling him young".
i'd been given the book
for my thirtieth birthday.
"the thirtieth year"
by ingeborg bachman.
so i had heard.
i had been told.
i knew all along, even if
i didn't really know.
the great true things are unsurprising.
but what did i do back then?
i carried on.
i carried on dutifully
we were the happy couple, elizabeth and i.
that's how people saw us.
but in truth, i did not cherish my wife.
and i did not cherish my friends.
or even my children.
i just carried on.
i made my way.
but with each step i cringed.
i was on the back foot, the defensive.
and now...
tonight, for the first time
i say...
my bones are broken.
broken.
one day i will need your help.
all of my bones are broken.
you're safe.
there's no shame here.
no one can see you.
but our rules must be respected.
no penetration.
thank you, clara.
take care.
you will feel better very soon.
thanks.
your instinct was right.
we'll see.
you really are a fuckwit.
adios amigo.
chinga tu madre.
(fuck your mother)
i'm really sorry.
me too.
good morning.
is this excel on still available?
that's right. fantastic place.
out of the city.
i have keys, i can show you
if you like.
no, it's fine.
i'm sure the excel on
will be excellent.
- it is better to see it, though.
- no, it's ok.
i have a friend in the building.
well, if that's the case,
then we can definitely do that.
do you have photo id?
some paperwork.
you know how it is.
a stitch in time saves nine.
hi, thomas. this is sara.
i was just wondering if
clara is out of her meeting.
maybe you could give me a hand.
thing is, i have a new lease.
i was just wondering if there's
any work available.
i'd be really grateful if you
could keep me in mind.
thanks very much. bye, thomas.
nearly done.
it's ok.
here it comes, it's all right.
sorry.
i have an important call,
i really have to take it.
i'll be back, dr. frankenstein.
ok. bad monster.
look.
it's my bag. i'm coming back, ok?
we have one rule.
no penetration.
only way i can get a hard on these days
is if i swallow a truckload of viagra...
and then some beautiful woman
jams her fingers up my ass.
i'm the one that needs
the penetration.
i don't expect that
good fortune tonight.
you're quite right.
thanks, clara.
stretch your cunt, you little bitch.
i'm gonna press your button
and make you all wet.
then i'm gonna fuck you
with my big dick.
i'm gonna fuck you with my
horse's prick and make you fucking scream.
you fucking little bitch.
you fucking little whore.
you fucking little bitch.
hi.
ok, i'm coming.
excuse me.
it's ok, i'm here.
hello, lucy.
take your top off.
i love drinking.
i'm really good at it.
when did you last see him?
about 3 or 4 months ago.
took him out to dinner.
he was wearing your old suit,
i think. the gray one.
i haven't seen the birdman in...
well, when was the last time
i saw you?
a year?
they say it was 2 weeks before
his brother found him.
will you marry me?
what?
why?
i mean
why now?
you had your chance.
go on.
fuck you.
fuck you to death.
that's one way to put it.
i'm with helen now.
i can't believe you.
i don't believe you.
you don't believe you.
fuck it.
helen is courteous.
you should try it sometime.
courtesy.
courtesy.
you'll be safe here.
there's no shame.
no one can see you.
thank you, clara.
i do ask that there?
will be no penetration.
i also ask that you take care
not to leave any marks.
thank you.
we do fire people here, you know?
well?
all right, you're fired.
thank you.
excuse me?
hello, excuse me?
hi. can i get some help?
what do you think of this one?
yeah, not bad.
ok, i'll take it then.
cool. up here.
ok. let's get going.
we pick up with black 129,
making a bold move to attack his triangle.
it's an impressive move,
unexpected.
and then, what does the
master do?
he counter attacks, with white
white 130? why did he do that?
after 27 long minutes of deliberation...
why did the master play a move,
that would result in his own defeat?
are you gonna come to the party?
i can't. have a big day tomorrow
- how big?
- i'm sleeping.
what?
live a little. just a little.
- what is it?
- i don't know.
but it's something good for you.
why not?
there you go.
back from the dead.
fear of death is the number 1 hoax.
lucy, turn it off.
hello?
yeah. in 2 minutes. ok.
you need to get some blinds.
fucking hell.
lucy.
come back inside.
- you're sure?
- she's fine.
can you pull over?
pull over!
- hello, darling.
- hi.
- are you well?
- fine, thank you.
- you sure?
- yeah, i'm fine.
a shower always works wonders.
i'd like to ask a favor.
i need to see what goes on in there.
just once.
i understand. believe me, i do.
but my clients...
how can i expose them,
to be frank, to blackmail?
just once.
that's not the way that
we do things.
- please, clara.
- i'm sorry.
and i can assume you're quite well?
perfectly fine, thank you.
and you're in good health?
yes.
good girl.
thank you, clara.
are you sure?
thank you.
goodnight.
goodnight.
