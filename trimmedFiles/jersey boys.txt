i'm the one you wanna talk to:

everything follows.
am i right, tommy?
bigger than sinatra, gyp.
my hand to god.
there were three ways
out of the neighborhood:
you join the army,
maybe you get killed.
you get mobbed up,
you might get killed that way.
or you get famous.
for us, it was two out of three.
it's gonna be good.
- be careful, huh?
- bye, mr. decarlo. yeah.
mother:

what's a matter with you? sit. there's
a couple things you gotta know first.
i don't have time for this shit.
there's two types of women.
there's type a and type b.
type a: they're real easy. they jump
right into bed with you. boom, boom, boom.
then later on, they break your balls.
then there's type b.
ask nicky about type b.
tell him about type b.
you gotta wine them, dine them.
- then what do they do?

- don't bend the suit. it's imported.
work on that b flat, frankie.
chest voice.
and do your exercises.
stanley, take it easy.
we're walking out of a church.
let's get out of here.
- hey, easy.
- officer 1: come on. out. out.
hey, princess.
hey, tommooch.
machoch.
so as i'm getting out,
nick is going in.
and the variety trio is now a single.
ain't gotta be no einstein to see there
ain't no future for me as a single.
so i make an executive decision.
i put frankie in the band.
hey, greg. how are you?
[band playing
"a sunday kind of love"]
<i>[singing]
my arms need someone to enfold</i>
<i>to keep me warm when</i>
<i>mondays are cold</i>
come on. let's get out of here.
hey. cool your <i>coglioni</i>.
i'm listening.
look at that son of
a bitch over there.
- where?
- that guy. the big guy. hitting on my girl.
[band continues playing]
that's not your girl.
she will be as soon as she meets me.
that's mary delgado. she'll eat you alive.
they'll send you home in an envelope.
come on, tommy. i'm in love.
<i>[singing] i want a sunday</i>
<i>kind of love</i>
[applause]
tommy: thank you very much, ladies and
gentlemen. we hope you enjoyed the evening.
special night having
you here and drink up.
[speaks in italian]
[in english] and then, get lost.
we got a second show at 10.
come on. can you introduce
me now, or what?
do me a favor. <i>'stu cazzo</i>
in the red tie? get rid of him.
- okay, friend. it's your bedtime.
- who are you?
i'm mother goose.
[man grunts and mary chuckles]
mary.
hey, tommooch.
mr. subtle, huh?
and you didn't even bat an eye.
frankie, this is mary delgado.
mary delgado, this is frankie vally.
hi.
how are you?
all right. slow down, okay?
the kid's barely legal.
since when do you care about legal?
hey, come here. come on.
listen to me.
this is type a,
you understand? type a.
- yeah, yeah. i got it.
- this is a hit-and-run.
yeah, yeah. i'm fine, man.
have a good time.
you know, that's a
nice color for you.
- you should always wear that.
- thanks for the fashion tip.
so, what do you say
we get out of here?
- frankie: so this is a pretty nice place, huh?
- yeah.
they don't sell slices.
that's how you can tell.
- so that's your real name? vally?
- no.
castelluccio. francis castelluccio.
kind of long for a marquee.
- that's why i changed it. vally. v-a-l-l-y.
- no.
- v-a-l-l-i.
- how come?
because "y" is a bullshit letter.
it doesn't know what it is.
is it a vowel? is it a consonant?
never thought about it.
plus which, you're italian.
you gotta end in a vowel.
delgad-o. castellucci-o.
pizz-a.
valli with an "i." it says "this is who i am.
you don't like it, go fuck yourself."
ah.
that's a very unusual fragrance.
i never smelled that before.
what do you call it?
soap.
tommy warned me about you.
yeah? what'd he say?
- he said i couldn't handle you.
- that's because he couldn't.
[chuckles]
so your group...?
- the varietones.
- yeah. just you and tommy?
and his brother, nick...
- ...and this other guy, nicky.
- so where were they?
they went away for a while.
what for?
they did some things.
with friends like that, maybe you should
just change your name to sinatra.
i'm gonna be as big as sinatra.
only if you stand on a chair.
hey, why you gotta
say that kind of stuff?
look, first of all, sinatra wouldn't
be caught dead in that jacket.
where'd you get it?
- i don't know. tommy got it off a truck.
- exactly.
tommy's a two-bit hustler.
he doesn't see the big picture.
yeah? so what do i do?
come here.
you got a nickel?
yeah.
call your mother.
you're gonna be home late.
[all cheering]
man 1: all right!
- man 2: attaboy, frankie.
- woman 1: you look beautiful, mary!
quick and painless.
quick and painless.
[tommy whoops then whistles]
mary had a couple of years on
him and they both wanted out.
up and out.
mary saw frankie as her chance,
and she poured it all into him.
love?
i'll be honest with you.
i never knew what that was.
marriage?
marriage is not love.
marriage is you take a shave while your
wife sits on the can and clips her toenails.
<i>tommy: anyway, frankie's married.</i>
<i>we're playing nights,
frankie's cutting hair in the daytime.</i>
<i>and it's their anniversary, and he
decides to get mary some jewelry.</i>
<i>so he goes shopping, jersey style.</i>
i don't understand. why can't this
guy bring stuff over the house?
he's a little nervous.
your wife's gonna love
this shit, frankie.
couple of watches. nice diamonds.
he got it out of some house in saddle river.
he had to smack the broad around.
- but she'll live.
- donnie: would you shut up?
he don't need to know all that.
frankie's cool. right, frankie?
yeah, no problem.
donnie: wait a minute.
this isn't bloomfield.
no, it's fairfield.
not fairfield, you fucking asshole.
bloomfield.
you said fairfield.
why would i say fairfield
if it was bloomfield?
maybe your brain is fucked up.
and don't call me an asshole.
why? it's what you are.
a piece of shit fucking asshole.
- hey, fellas, it's okay.
- you stay out of this!
hey! don't get out of line.
no! fuck him! and fuck you! okay?
i'm not the asshole! you're the asshole!
don't you call me
an asshole, asshole!
oh, yeah. and what are you
gonna do about it, asshole?
- what am i gonna do about it?
- asshole.
- yeah, yeah.
- how about this?
[tires screech]
holy shit!
what are you, crazy?
now who's the asshole?
- jeez, donnie, my god!
- get out. get out!
get out! i'll call you tomorrow.
come on. i'll take care of this. go!
go! go! frankie, go!
[laughing]
aw. you should have seen his face.
i almost felt sorry for the kid.
yeah, well, don't. we gotta
lean on him. and hard.
we need that money, donnie. okay?
asshole.
- ha-ha-ha.
- ha-ha-ha. get in the front.
[banging on door]
what are you, deaf? open it.
put the plate down
and open it. open it!
what if it's your wife?
don't worry about it.
just open the fucking door.
tommy.
tommy, something
terrible just happened.
agh. slow down.
so he shot somebody in your car...
and they charge you $20,000
to make it go away?
frankie: twenty-five.
sweetheart, gimme a kiss,
go powder your nose.
so let me ask you something.
if he shot the guy,
why should you pay?
what are you, nuts? it's my car.
there's a dead guy in it.
my prints are all over. the cops are
gonna trace it. it's a murder rap.
frankie, it's a scam.
what?
they fake a murder in your car,
then charge you to make it go away.
there was blood.
i saw it with my own eyes.
eh?
- or fake blood, like in the movies.
- huh?
- shit.
- let me explain something to you, all right?
you shoot somebody, you gotta
shoot all the witnesses too.
that's a basic rule.
i bet you $100 your car is sitting in his
driveway right now. hundred dollars, i bet you.
but donnie's my friend.
and i'm not your friend? huh?
- i'm your friend.
- all right.
fuck donnie.
now go home. i'll take care of it.
- what are you gonna do, call gyp?
- are you <i>stunade</i>? you mention that name?
you don't bother gyp decarlo
with two-bit bullshit.
i said i'll take care of it,
all right? go home.
take care of your wife.
thanks, tommy. i owe you.
what am i gonna do with you?
huh?
stupid.
you said it, gyp.
take off your hat.
okay, i'll say it once, so get
it through your thick skulls.
frankie is my friend. <i>capisce?</i>
you don't touch him, you don't speak
to him, you don't even dream about him.
if you see him coming toward you,
you cross the street.
but if he trips, you better
be there to catch him.
hmm?
and now, get out of here.
you're being watched, friends.
thank you, tommy.
[band playing "my mother's eyes"]
<i>[singing] god's gift from up above</i>
<i>a real unselfish love</i>
<i>i've found in my</i>
<i>mother's eyes</i>
[applause]
thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.
he's good. yeah. he's very good.
- have a good night.
- thank you.
i appreciate you sang that, frankie.
it was my mother's favorite song.
oh, please. my pleasure, mr. decarlo.
by the way, you get your car back?
my car? yeah.
those guys, they went away?
yeah.
you're a good boy, frankie.
frankie, here's your claim check.
anytime you got a problem...
you reach out to me.
- mm?
- all right.
- beautiful tonight.
- thanks.
you got something to say? huh?
hmm?
good.
for years, i'm humping decarlo's
laundry, he treats me like a bum.
frankie sings one song,
he gets a claim check.
i'll tell you,
it's good to be lead singer.
anyway, nick massi finally
revolves out of rahway.
- hey.
- tommy: hey.
[chuckling]
look at you.
look at this guy.
like you never left.
tom mooch.
frankie.
so it's me, nick and frankie. and it's
up to me to keep us out of the gutter.
but nobody's hiring trios anymore.
trios are dead.
the fact is, i'm all out of ideas.
but i could still do math.
three lovers equals zero bookings. so to
generate some walking around money...
i'm working with this kid on a
project at a local establishment.
[the royal teens' "short
shorts" playing on jukebox]
<i>- who wears short shorts?
- we wear short shorts</i>
<i>they're such short shorts</i>
[bowling pins crashing]
- hey, you listening?
- yeah. tommy, i'm working. come on.
you being a wiseass?
after the fifth frame you start
spotting the pins like we said. right?
yeah, i know, a little off.
so listen. we got this
jazz group, you know.
we're playing up in
bergenfield with this kid.
tommy, this kid. he plays like
a madman. he writes songs.
i'm thinking this is the
guy you're looking for.
- yeah, for what?
- "for what?"
for the group. the band,
the lovers, the romans...
whatever the hell the name is
this week. tommy, this is his song.
<i>[singing] who wears short shorts</i>
<i>boom, boom, boom
we wear short shorts</i>
[bowling pins crash
then joey screams]
i told you! i warned you! i swear i'm
gonna come over, you motherfucker!
lucky you got a split!
i'm gonna split open your head!
joey. pay attention, huh?
can we take care of our business?
we take care of business,
then we talk about you being a scout.
yeah, sure, tommy.
listen. you don't screw this up,
there's a c-note in it for you.
what's his name?
gaudio. bob gaudio. if you want,
i can arrange a sit-down.
i handle the sit-downs.

hi. um. so i was just
wondering if, um...
who's, like, the girl in your song?
i mean, do you have a girlfriend?
oh, no. no. it's any girl,
it's every girl.
it's what t.s. eliot calls
"the objective correlative."
i felt like you were singing to me.
you're not from around here, are you?
probably somewhere
really exotic, though.
- girl: like europe.
- tommy: all right, we gotta talk.
- oh, yeah.
- hey, ladies.
- hi, how are you?
- so good.
tommy: good. i'll tell you what.
i'm gonna shut my eyes,
and i'm gonna count to three.
when i open them, you're gonna disappear.
ready? one. two. three.
- and they're gone.
- heh.
so you got an agent? a manager?
somebody does your deals?
it's okay. you can talk to me.
- you sure?
- yeah.
tell you what. we're gonna hire
you on a trial basis, all right?
let's say three weeks, $25 a
week and we see how it goes.
- oh, that's not gonna work.
- and why not?
i was thinking i would come in equal.
really?
plus, i retain publishing
on anything i write.
and we can work out a favored nations
on any mechanical and ancillary rights.
excuse me a minute.
- forget it.
- why?
he wants a four-way split.
in his dreams.
well, tommy, this kid's good.
you think this kid is the golden goose?
he wrote one fucking song.
gonna cut him in equal?
there's a million out there.
where?
- where what?
- the million guys. where?
- can i just say something here?
- no.
- tommy, i like him.
- you got a hard-on for this kid?
look at him. he can't drink,
he can't smoke.
he ain't never been laid before.
what good is he?
you think he's green, take him under
your wing like you did with me.
you want to cut him in equal?
if it works, there'll be enough for everybody.
if it doesn't, what's the difference?
i'll tell you what, we don't need a keyboard.
that's my decision. that's the end of it.
all right. then go get
another lead singer.
what'd you say?
i said get yourself
another lead singer.
what's the matter with you?
what you want, a fucking smack? huh?
what is this?
oh, i see.
all right.
i'll tell you what.
we cut him in equal and it goes up in
smoke, don't fucking blame me, all right?
- you all right with this?
- yeah. let's give it a try.
i'm gonna deal with you later.

[speaks in french]
[in english]
welcome to civilization, <i>mes enfants.</i>
[guests chattering and
jazz playing on piano]
- where did he get his drink?
- frankie: vassar.
hi.
tommy:

no, darling. the magic
happens in the bedroom.
it's not the back seat, but i
prefer a roof over my head.
i'm joking. go make some friends
and don't get into trouble.
- he's so serious.
- tommy: holy shit.
frankie: it's like jane of the
jungle over there, times two.
- tommy: is that vodka?
- uh-huh.
give me a triple.
i'll take a whiskey.
- how much is that?
- oh, it's free.
it's fascinating, isn't it?
he has such...
freedom.
tommy: hmm.
they should take it away.
- the painting?
- his freedom.
so looks like i forgot
my gold head wrap.
[girl chuckles]
- the best of the best.
- ah.

[all chuckle]
- frankie: hey, what are you doing?
- tommy: shut up.

[playing jazz music]
<i>bob: crewe introduced us
to a whole new world.</i>
<i>he signed us to a record contract and
it seemed like we were on our way.</i>
- that was good.
<i>- bob: but we had a problem.</i>
[band playing "i still care"]
<i>frankie [singing]: still care</i>
<i>all: still care</i>
<i>i still care for you</i>
<i>- still care
- still care</i>
<i>ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</i>
we never read the fine print.
the contract had us as backup singers
with an option to record four of our songs.
crewe's option.
so we spent the next year being the
musical equivalent of room service.
<i>even in the dark of night
knowing that you're not in sight</i>
<i>- i still care
- i still care</i>
<i>maybe if you love me</i>
<i>you'll give me another chance</i>
<i>chance, i</i>
<i>'cause i still care</i>
<i>i still care for you</i>
[frank singing]
[all laugh]
sorry. we won't... sorry.
did you get all that?
billy dixon and the topix.
"trance." take three.
<i>[singing] late last night
strolling down the street</i>
<i>i saw a ghost that...</i>
[singing]
stop the tape.
you guys are not
hearing it like i do.
i'm sorry, crewe. how do you hear it?
i'm hearing it in sky blue.
you're giving me brown.
- maybe that's because you're paying us shit.
- excuse me?
i'm sorry. famous ears clogged up?
i'll say it into the mike.
maybe because you're
paying us fucking shit.
- is there a problem?
- yeah.
let's see what the
goddamn problem is.
we got his attention.
he's coming down.
it's about fucking time.
are our sessions cutting
into your time at the track?
- let me tell you the problem.
- here's the problem:
you said you'd record us. that was a
year ago. when are you gonna record us?
- give me a hit.
- i've given you 10 hits.
they're all derivative.
find yourselves a name and a sound and
then maybe we can make something happen.
how do you know what's a hit
until you get it out there?
okay. you want me to produce
four songs? get me the money.
- what are you talking about?
- i am tapped out.
you want a session,
it's gonna cost you $3500.
eight rooms on park avenue,
he's tapped out.
ten, sam spade. and i've got
certain personal obligations.
yeah. no, i saw him.
don't get me started, baby.
perfect.
tommy: could use a little more color.
thanks a lot.
pleasure working with you.
yeah, maybe powder blue.
royal blue.
bullshit.
crewe's right about one thing.
your songs are derivative.
bob: really?
you don't think i know
what that means?
it means they all sound
like each other.
lay off. let bob write the songs,
you make the bookings, okay?
okay, okay, okay.
i talked to the manager.
you do two sets.
it's a cool $350 a night.
ten nights, you got your session.
- and i'm only gonna take 5 percent.
- what?
or not. joking.
- how about it?
- okay, let's do it.
- tommy: good.
- bob: uh...
okay.
it's good.
[pop music playing on jukebox]

hey, joey, you're a real prick.
this is crazy. we gotta find a club.
forget the clubs. what we
want is a record contract.
what contract? we can't even
book a lousy bowling alley.
maybe this is a good time
to start my own group.
you're not starting any groups.
you're in this group, nicky.
yeah, which one? the topix?
the romans? the lovers?
who we gonna be next, tommy?
[electricity crackling]
joey: frankie.
frankie: what?
it's a sign, tommy.
tommy: ooh.
i still like the four felons.
yeah, but we still need the $3500.
don't worry about it, all right?
i'll take care of it. that's what i do.
now just write us a goddamn hit.
put that in the trunk.
<i>bob: so i lock myself in my room and
i write four new songs in two days.</i>
<i>no, not songs.</i>
<i>hits.</i>
tommy: norman.
what's up?
you're late.
i couldn't find parking for my canoe.
heh. five thousand.

- i don't wanna get behind on anything.
i'll send you a record.
better yet, send me three
grand by next friday.
three grand?
- i thought it was like a thousand.
- three grand.
<i>- frankie: so you like the new name?</i>
- i love the new name.
- all right.
- and so did vivaldi.
what? who?
- some guy stole our name? i'll go talk to him.
- it's okay, tommy. he's already dead.
what about the songs?
the songs? i love the songs.
the songs are great.
- but we still have a problem.
- tommy: what?
the <i>scarols?</i>

it's 3500.
devito delivers.

i'll drink to that.
let me see. "sherry."

tommy: this is bullshit, frankie.

lay off the booze while you're at it.
hey, watch your mouth in my house.

paper he wrote 15 minutes ago.
gimme.
- this looks good.
- no, it's an insult. it's a slap in the face.
don't take it personal.
it looks good.
- tommy: i'm on the hook.
- we do the four we rehearsed.
we're not taking votes here,
all right? i run the group.
we don't have enough time.
crewe's got the ears. let him decide.
crewe's gonna tell you the same thing.

been twisted around a girl's little finger.
if i'm explaining that to
you, we're in trouble.
now knock off the bullshit
and sing the song.
roll the tape, phil.
[sighs]
"walk like a man."

[singing]
loosen up that bow tie.
tommy: where's bobby? bobby's gotta
see this face. look at this face.
i'll say this about tommy.
he had his issues, but he
sure knew how to run a party.
<i>fast as i can</i>
<i>walk like a man from you</i>
[indistinct chattering]
i bring the boy to the party.
now i bring the party to the boy.
oh, hello.

[all laugh]
[phone rings]

you'll be here in 10 minutes.
i got a present for you.

i can handle here. right, toni?
all right. bye.
<i>[singing] like a man</i>
<i>like a</i>
<i>man</i>
[audience cheering]
did i not say the stars
were in alignment?
three number ones in a row.
- you are always right, crewe.
- crewe: there's that.
- where's tommy and nicky? get them.
- frankie: hey, come on in here.
tommy: over here. he's got golden
ears, he's blind as a bat.
- come on! three number ones!
- crewe: right?
- that's what i'm saying.
- who's the best fucking team?
- all right.
- come on, frankie. aah.
well, maybe we should
make an investment.
- in what? in art?
- mm-mm. in us.
what do you mean?
well, you got the voice.
i got the songs.
yeah, so?
so we make a partnership. i give
you half of everything i write...
and you give me half of everything
you record outside the group.
why would i ever record
outside the group?
i don't know. things happen.
what about tommy and nick?
nicky's really the
one got me singing.
tommy, we wouldn't be here
if it weren't for him.
- it won't cut into their share. i'd never do that.
- we gotta tell them.
yeah, of course.
if things work out,
think we could talk about a sax?
if things work out, we can talk
about a whole horn section.
okay, i'm in.
all right.
i'll have somebody
draw up a contract.
what, you mean like sign a
piece of paper from a lawyer?
- yeah.
- you wanna do this thing?
- but we gotta get something on paper.
- so we do it.
you want a contract?
here.
a jersey contract.
[band playing "my boyfriend's back"]
<i>[singing]
he went away and you hung around</i>
<i>and bothered me every night</i>
<i>and when i wouldn't go outwith you</i>
<i>you said things that
weren't very nice</i>

- what?
- share and share alike.
hey, tommy, you put that 10
grand back in the tax account?
come on, nicky.
get off my back, all right?
well, it's adding up. plus the 3500 you
dropped at the track last saturday...
what are you, a ledger? huh?
forget it. from now on
there's a new arrangement.
frankie rides with me.
you ride with the genius.
- that's kind of up to frankie, isn't it?
- stick to what you know.
come on.
isn't it up to bobby too? i mean,
the two of them are always together.
they're like a pair of...
um, what do you call them...
chinese twins.
try not to say anything the rest
of the day. all right, sweetheart?
everybody has a girlfriend,
honey. everybody.
i don't understand. why did you
get married in the first place?
- are you kidding? family is everything.
- oh.
well, that makes sense.
- frankie: here we go. all right.
- this looks like the place.
- okay, bobby, i'll call you.
- yep.
- get your stuff?
- i got it.
- have a good one.
- take it easy.
you show up for a couple of days
and think that makes you a father?
at least when i'm here,
i'm here. i'm not stoned.
- think the kids don't know?
- you wanna switch places? anytime!
- there's the kitchen and washing!
- go. we'll live off what you make!
no, thanks. i wouldn't
wanna cramp your style.
the road is the road.
i'm there to provide for this family.
- certain things are none of your business!
- your family's out there!
you think i don't know what goes on?
here. unh!
give it to one of your
"special friends."
go tour outer space.
you'll still be what you always were:
a dumb wop from jersey who never
even graduated high school.
mr. vally with a "y."
give me a fucking break.
pick that up.
pick that up.
is mommy very sick?
what do you mean?
well, sometimes she drinks a lot of medicine
and then goes to sleep on the couch.
medicine, huh?
hmm.
well, you know, francine...
sometimes that medicine
makes mommy really tired.
daddy, do you love me?
of course i love you.
but do you like me?
do i like you?
are you crazy? yes, i like you.
i like you more than the stars
and the moon and the sun...
and everything all thrown
in together, okay?
will you go to sleep now?
sing me.
<i>[singing] my eyes adored you</i>
<i>though i never laid a hand on you
my eyes adored you</i>
<i>like a million miles away from me
you couldn't see how i adored you</i>
<i>so close</i>
<i>so close and yet so far</i>
here.
like this.
- you cozy?
- mm-hm.
okay?
good.
- frankie: be good. okay?
- mm-hm.
come on.
thanks, francine.
it's a puppet who's a mouse with
an accent. i don't get it either.
you are not playing to the house.
you're playing to the camera.
don't move around too much.
and don't look down.
and smile. hey, it's <i>ed sullivan</i>,
not a funeral.
one minute.
norman: hey, frankie!
you guys are fabulous. you guys just
keep getting better and better.
- thanks.
- is tommy around?
who wants to know?
norman waxman, frankie.
a friend of tommy's.
- listen. what's this about?
- money.
- listen, mr....
- waxman.
norman waxman.
you got business, talk to
our attorney. excuse me...
no, no, no. you got a
little success now, right?
you got the records, the tv,
the personal appearances.
we're all very proud of you.
excuse me. you can't be here.
norman: tommy's put me
in this awkward position.
i've stalled my people as long
as i can, but he's in too deep.
they want their money. now.
before something unfortunate happens
and it all goes up in smoke.
this is bullshit.
how much does tommy owe you?
- 150 large.
- excuse me?
- one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
- jesus.
hey. did you think i
wasn't gonna make it?
hey, normie.
- what's up?
- hey, tommy,
man: you're on.
the guy said we had 5.
bob: well, we're on now.
<i>for all of the youngsters in
the country, the four seasons.</i>
<i>so let's have a pleasant
intro for them.</i>
[applause]

[band playing "working

<i>been paying every day</i>
[singing]
bob will tell you it
was smooth sailing...
right up until we hit the iceberg
with tommy and the $150,000.
that's bob.
he was always looking so
far into the future...
he never saw what was
going on under his nose.
fact is, the trouble didn't
start at the sullivan show.
it started long before that.
<i>oh, for every day
i made you cry</i>
[band playing "dawn (go away)"]

dawn, go away
[all cheering]
thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
we'll see you again next year.
wonderful time.
- great show, fellas!
- bob: thank you!
- welcome to cleveland!
- thank you!
you're under arrest.
- what?
- for what?
- officer: defrauding an innkeeper.
- what?
you fellas played here last year?
tommy: yeah.
you stay at a holiday inn?
- i don't remember.
- well, they do.
you skipped without paying the bill.
- you owe $120.
- for crying out loud...
a minor oversight. i can
take care of that right now.
take that up with the judge.
come on, officer, can't we
deal with this privately?
you wouldn't be offering
a bribe, would you?
tommy: all right, all right.
my friend, my friend, my friend.
every man is looking for a queen.
where is she?
oh, with another man.
what're you gonna do? it happens.
we're all winners here. that's 40 you owe me.
hey, nicky, you remember when
we couldn't get arrested?
when was that? when you were 3?
tommy:
all right. calm down, genius, huh?
it's not the end of the world.
we'll be out in a couple of days.
this may come as a shock to you,
but i don't have a police record.
oh, no? well, it's never
too late to start, right?
hey, who knows, maybe you guys
come up with a hit song out of it.
right, frankie, huh?
<i>[sings] oh, me, oh, my-o</i>
come on, frankie.
<i>[singing] did some time in old ohio</i>
tommy, can it.
come on. calm your friend down.
he's about to shit his pants.
i'm not gonna calm down.
i'm in a jail cell with a...
--person.
[tommy laughing]
[nick chuckling and tommy whooping]
hello.
girl: over here.
tommy: hey, hi.
thank you very much.
you have a very nice jail.
bob never forgave tommy
for that weekend.
me, i let it slide because
the group comes first.
we're all in this together, right?
here, beautiful.
right.
tommy:
thank you. thank you very much.
- of course, of course.
- bob: we love ohio.
[indistinct chattering]
we shouldn't be drawing
on this account.
we gotta set something
aside for uncle sam.
lou, this is november.
april's what, nine months away?
- six, actually.
- and that's why you're the accountant.
yes. and that's why
i think it's important...
don't think. i'm the client.
twenty thousand,
bellevue apartments, i.n.c.
what's "gava"?
- it's a fruit, like your brother.
- hey.
bobby and frankie's partnership.
- what partnership?
- some kind of cockamamie partnership.
about what?
frankie sings, bobby writes,
some kind of split.
- and you knew about this?
- yeah, so?
so when were you gonna tell me?
all right. don't make a <i>braciola</i>, uh?
doesn't cut into your share.
i don't know. a group is a group.
it's not two guys with a side deal.
and i agree with you.
you think it's gonna work
with those two egos?
nick:
i think i should start my own group.
- you're not starting anything.
- why not?
you gotta wake up before
noon to start your own.
lou, you're a gentleman.
so i let that slide too.
i mean, we were doing good.
concerts, club dates, cover of cashbox.
six more weeks at number one,
that covered a lot of sins.
until we hit detroit.
<i>this reporter comes to do a feature
on us, and frankie falls hard.</i>
so tell me a little bit about
where you grew up.
i'm from belleville, new jersey.
right outside of newark.
mm-hm.
here, look.
i got some pictures here.
that's my mother.
best meatball sandwiches
in all of america.
five-foot-two,
but don't mess with her.
[lorraine chuckles]
she really wanted me out
of that neighborhood.
course, she's still right there in the
same projects but i can't get her out.
she doesn't wanna leave
her friends. i tell her:
"take them with you,
i'll move them all." she says no.
send her cash, it goes in the drawer.
the washing machine breaks,
she won't spend money.
goes to the laundromat.
tells everybody she's
frankie valli's mother.
people think i'm the kind of son that
makes his mother go to a laundromat.
[chuckles]
what else you wanna know?
then she interviewed tommy.
thing about tommy is...
he was only used to dealing
with a certain class of woman...
so when he went up against
lorraine, it was like, no contest.
tommy: what did frankie say about me?
not really much.
more about him and bobby.
how the group never took
off till bobby came along.
tommy:
did he tell you that i hired bobby?
he said it was more
like a group decision.
- oh, he said that, huh?
- mm-hm.
did he tell you that before i took him on
he was studying to be a hairdresser?
- no.
- oh, yeah.
the kid was lost.
between you and me...
and don't print this because
he doesn't want it out there...
i taught him everything he knows.
- really?
- everything.
- ah.
- but not everything i know.
aah.
i even had to get
him laid the first time.
give him a little tutoring.
well, you tutored him very well.
why don't we cut to the
chase here, lorraine.
how do you mean, tommy?
well, i can see you're a big girl.
look, when you get tired
of high school...
you let me know when you wanna
check out the graduate course.
[both chuckle]
okay.
he hit on you?
only, like, with a sledgehammer.
that son of a bitch,
i'm gonna kill him.
- it was funny.
- it's not. you don't do that.
- he's pathetic. leave it alone.
- you don't do it!
now i'm supposed to
go on stage with him?
- sing with him? make jokes? what is he, crazy?
- he might be stupid. ever think of that?
tommy's not stupid. he's evil.
did he put his hands on you?
no, of course not.
this is bad.
- fuck!
- jesus. what is the matter with you?
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
pick a card, pick a card. no?
mr. big shot over here.
hey, everybody, that's frankie valli.
<i>he's freezing me out.</i>
i mean, what did i
do so terrible, huh?
take him off the street?
put him in the group?
hustle with him all these years.
take him in like this, nicky.
like this.
make him a star.
and now he won't even look at me.
like tommy devito's a fucking stain.
gimme a break.
for what? for what, i ask you, huh?
a piece of ass? for that?
get the fuck out of here.
i mean, is there an ounce of
good that i did? one ounce?
hand me that, will you?
there's no towels.
hand me the fucking towel.
[blowing nose]
am i right, or am i right?
i want bobby to handle
cash from now on.
what?
i want bobby to handle the cash.
all right, let me explain something.
when i leave this group...
or they carry me out...
bob can handle whatever
you want bob to handle.
while i'm in this group, he's not gonna
handle a dime. you understand?
not a fucking dime.
get that through your fucking head.
- nick: maybe we should put it to a vote.
- what?
what was that?
- maybe we should put it to a vote.
- tommy: a vote?
all right. i see. i see.
now we got a democracy.
all right. let's put it to a vote.
should bob handle the money,
yea or nay? huh?
- huh?
- bob: hey, hey!
tommy: well, that's my vote.
anybody else?
- tommy...
- bob: let it go.
what?
oh, looks like the nays have it.
tommy won that one, but it was
the beginning of the end.
something just snapped and after
that it was just a long slow slide.
<i>until norm waxman showed up
backstage at the</i> sullivan show...
<i>and blew the lid off...</i>
<i>we had no idea how deep in he was.</i>
<i>[singing] with a burning love inside</i>
<i>yeah, i'm workin' my
way back to you, babe</i>
<i>and the happiness that died</i>
<i>i let it get away</i>
<i>i let it get away</i>
<i>i'll be workin' my way back to you</i>
[cheering]
you'd think after everything
that went down...
frankie would have cut
tommy loose right then.
if that's what you think...
you're not from jersey.
frankie: hey, gyp.
- tommy's in a little trouble.
- how little?
hundred and fifty thousand.
oh. why isn't he standing
here talking to me?
because he can't sing
"my mother's eyes" like i can.
you take care of family,
frankie. i like that.
yeah.
i'll see what i can do.
gyp: we're here to resolve a problem.
we're all gentlemen.
we will act in a civilized manner.
[all speak in italian]
[in english]
how much are we talking about?
as of noon today, including the vig:
one hundred and sixty-two large.
what were you thinking, tommy?
i don't know, gyp. it, uh...
it always felt like i was playing
catch-up. it just crept up.
i'm surprised he's
still walking around.
i'll be honest with you, gyp.
we like their songs.
anybody else, he'd already
be in the hospital.
come on. gimme a break, huh?
what are you gonna do, huh? you fuck.
- sic one of your goons on me?
- man is trying to work with you.
- hey, whose side are you on?
- mine.
- tommy: of course you are.
- asshole.
- i'm an asshole? you asshole.
- from day one.
- fuck you.
- fuck you.
fuck you, nicky.
gentlemen, our friend mr. waxman
has a legitimate point.
excuse me. all due respect.
he opened it up.
i'm gonna say something.
i've been rooming with this guy on
and off for, what is it, 10 years?
this was not a walk in the park.
this was a sentence.
a 10-year sentence.
the man is a personal nightmare.
he wears the same underwear
three days running.
he takes no pride in his appearance.
in the simple amenities of life.
you wanna talk about towels?
this isn't the time...
the man cannot be in a hotel
without using all the towels.
i'm talking face towels,
bath towels...
the bathmat, the little washcloths.
like he's living alone.
you need a towel, you know
where it is? in a pile on the floor.
i come back to the room one time
the man is pissing in the sink.
- i never pissed in the sink.
- right in the fucking sink.
i say, "tommy, what's wrong
with you? there's a toilet."
he says, "this was closer."
this is what i'm dealing with.
the man is not properly socialized.
frankie doesn't have to
deal with it. gaudio doesn't.
i've had to deal with it 10 years!
okay, nick. thank you
for sharing that.
now, norm and me...
we're gonna take a little walk,
work things out.
i want you boys to put
your heads together.
see what you can come up with.
and, you.
hey!
stay out of my bathroom.
pff.
maybe gyp can talk
sense into this guy.
forget sense.
forget sense.
i got a couple of things.
i could work something out.
pull a job? roll a 7-eleven,
like the old days.
shut your trap, all right,
and drink your wine!
decarlo's not running
this group, i am.
i don't know what we're doing
here, begging for help.
you make me look like an asshole.
- you do that all by yourself.
- frankie: can we talk about...?
you know what'd be nice? since i was
here before any of you? respect.
for what? getting 162 in the hole?
you know something? at least i tried, huh?
you think it's easy running the group?
dealing with the club owners,
the managers, the record companies?
everybody trying to fuck
you five ways from sunday?
you don't care how it gets done, nicky.
i took care of it! me!
sit down.
sit down.
sit down.
all right.
let's get it all out, right?
crucify me, right? come on.
right, tommy.
all right.
you don't give a shit about
the group. never have.
it's always been whatever it is you
got going on, and then the group.
never rehearse, drive nicky to drink,
put bob through the wringer.
forget trying to mess with my head,
which you've done from day one.
- you don't know what you're talking about.
- frankie: be quiet for once.
you know what the
shame of it is, tommy?
you're not a bad musician if you
give a little time. but, nah.
you're too busy shooting your mouth off or
buying apartments to keep your girlfriends in.
but no more.
all that bullshit is over.
this is how you talk to your friends?
friends, right.
not one christmas present.
not one christmas card.
not one time we go for a meal
and you pick up the check.
not one time do you ask me how my
kids are doing, how i'm doing.
god help me, tommy, part of me
would really like to see you hurt.
hey! hey! don't! come on! tommy!
tommy: you talk to me that way?
nick: come on! get off him, get off!
schoolkids!
leave that outside.
[gyp speaking in italian]
[in english] all right?
here's how it's gonna go down.
excuse me, mr. decarlo. the group...
we've come to a decision.
we have?
we're gonna pay back
every penny tommy owes.
- wait a minute.
- let me handle this.
it's a lousy few hundred grand.
we got something, it took
a lot of work and years.
- so?
- the group takes the debt.
this is his problem.
why do we take his debt?
because we're not gonna
let it come apart.
is that good enough, tommy?
for what?
frankie's singing was
never good enough.
his ideas were never good enough.
nothing was good enough.
the kid who was never good
enough is bailing you out.
so is that good enough?
it's a little more
complicated than that.
why?
norman: my people are very angry.
- they want a message sent.
- what message?
you're moving to las vegas.
what for?
norman: your health.
we're gonna keep an eye on you.
we see you outside of
nevada, it gets ugly.
no way. no way. not nevada.
better throw me in the river.
your choice.
- wait a minute. for how long?
- norman: till it's paid off.
- but we're in the middle of a tour.
- best i could do.
- but what happens to the group?
- i'll tell you what happens. nothing.
why? because it's still on paper that
i own 25 percent. so suck on that.
i got a better idea.
a clean break. we buy him out.
what? no, no, no. you don't
buy me out. i buy you out.
with what, tommy?
all right. fine.
buy me out. it's over anyway.
how many more hits you
think you're gonna write?
all right, wait a minute.
anything else we don't know about?
i maybe borrowed a little
from the tax account.
how much?
half a mil.
- in that neighborhood.
- oof.
we're gonna take that too.
- what are you...?
- i said let me handle it.
the loan, the taxes...
we take it all.
all right.
that's it, then.
norm. tommy.
excuse us.
hey, frankie.
frankie.
it's that bad, huh?
frankie...
you are digging a million-dollar
hole for yourself.
tommy took me off the streets, gyp.
what's that worth?
you'll be on the road till you're 90.
you want, i could arrange a loan.
thanks, mr. decarlo, but i don't want anybody
involved in our future besides me and frankie.
hey, i just realized something.
i don't wanna be in
this group anymore.
- frankie: not now, nicky.
- no, forget that. i wanna go home.
what are you talking about?
i wanna go home.
good idea. after the tour,
we all take a break.
no. now.
i quit.
you can't quit.
i got his attention. hi, bob.
nicky, nicky, we're in
the middle of a tour.
yeah. you know, i always
hated the touring.
fucking hotels.
those tiny little bars of soap.
you're supposed to wash with that?
can't even see it.
you're talking crazy.
calm down and we'll figure it out.
i already figured it out.
i'll make it easy for you.
i don't want money.
i don't want side deals.
all i want is out.
you're right about the soap.
hey, nicky. nicky.
bob: nicky!
we're in the middle of a damn tour!
are you crazy?
gyp: nicky, wait.
wait up.
let me understand.
you put in all this time,
you have all these hits...
and yet, you're gonna just walk away?
that is crazy.
me and the wife had a little trouble
last year, so you know what i did?
i put the kids with my parents.
and then i told them, my own kids...
i made up this thing where i told them
i was really their uncle. uncle nick.
i don't understand.
so i could screw around, you know.
do what i wanted.
i figured if i wasn't home to put them to bed,
they wouldn't feel deprived of a father.
i don't know what to say, nick.
all due respect, mr. decarlo...
you sell a hundred million records,
see how you handle it.
frankie and bob,
they're gonna take this hard.
i'm not worried.
those guys, with all their talent...
they'll never even know i'm gone.
you want me to go out there
by myself? are you nuts?
look, there's a lot of great
backup guys out there, right?
there's joe long, charlie calello.
we find two more
and put you in front.
get a great drummer. a horn
section like we talked about.
like basie and the kenton band.
- what do you do?
- write and produce.
i don't like it.
- why?
- you're crapping out on me.
- i thought we had a handshake.
- we do.
i wake up in the middle of the night,
i don't know where i am.
i think, "what the hell happened?
what's gonna happen? everybody leaves."
why does everybody leave?
frankie.
this is your time.
how do you do that?
what?
get me to agree to stuff.
it's a gift.
<i>[singing] you're only holdin' out your heart
in sympathy</i>
<i>frankie: so while bob's at
home with his family...</i>
<i>i'm on the road 200 nights a year,
doing anything i can dig up:</i>
<i>night clubs, hotels,
private parties, anything.</i>
<i>[singing]
i'll be blue and i'll be cryin' too</i>
<i>but, girl, you know
i only want what's best for you</i>
<i>what good is all my pride</i>
[phone ringing]
yeah, you and me both, pal.
man: mr. valli.
you got a collect call from jersey.
- where is she?
- mary: you tell me. she's your daughter too.
she never knows if you'll visit,
it's always last minute.
i'm an entertainer. things get moved!
- she needs a father!
- how about a mother?
pull yourself together.
[phone rings]
shit. hello.
hello?
can i talk to mommy?
francine.
where are you, sweetheart?
your mother and i are worried sick.
i'm in the city, okay?
don't have a cow.
<i>frankie:
sweetheart, you can't disappear...</i>
off the face of the earth.
leave a note.
<i>don't yell at me, daddy.</i>
look.
i just took a plane halfway
across the country.
you got money for a cab?
<i>just get in a cab and come home.</i>
so now you're gonna be
a father all of a sudden?
<i>it's two lousy days, daddy.</i>
you disappear for months at a time.
<i>- that's different, francine.
- i know. you're working.</i>
you're slaving away so you
can give us a good life.
i've heard it a billion times.
give me a break.
<i>- can i talk to mom?</i>
- don't talk to me like that. i'm your father.
francine?
shit.
good job, dad.
- man: francine?
- yeah.
- your father, he'd like to see you.
- oh, can i help you?
no. come on.
who the hell are you?
get lost before i snap your neck.
it's okay. i'll call you.
thanks, johnny.
anytime, frankie.
sit down, francine.
how'd you find me?
i got friends who have
friends on the street.
you mean your friends in the mob?
you want something?
coke.
- can we get a coke over here?
- server: sure.
listen, francine.
i made some mistakes.
i wasn't around enough.
your mother...
we both know about her.
i should have stepped in...
but it's hard to balance
the home and the work.
maybe someday, you'll have a
family and you'll understand that.
hey. all right. gimme that.
you wanna be a singer,
first thing is you stop that.
you could be a great singer.
you got my chops, you got
your mother's beauty.
you could have everything you want.
but you gotta get it together.
what's wrong with you?
running around like this?
look, i know how hard it is.
you got something you wanna share
with the world and nobody gives a shit.
but then things turn around.
you have to have patience,
and you gotta keep working.
we're gonna turn things around.
all right?
i'm gonna help you.
i'm gonna get you in singing lessons.
you're gonna start eating right,
gonna start exercising.
i set it up with bob crewe, he's
gonna record you a demo. four songs.
all you.
we're gonna get out
of this nightmare.
you can do this.
this is what you want, right? right?
come here.
i believe in you.
i'm glad you're here with me.
you know, it's funny...
back in the day, we almost left crewe
because he wouldn't record us a demo.
four songs.
and now he's doing it for francine.
i swear, that kid,
she was going under.
you know what it's like out
there with kids and drugs.
and her mother, you think
it's about the kid? no.
it's who's winning, who's wrong,
who's right, who screwed up.
i mean, this woman...
people turn into something.
- frankie.
- what?
i can't do this.
what do you mean?
this is a small apartment. there's not
enough room for your whole family.
can you stop that for a minute?
what's the point? i gotta
be out of town next week...
then i come back and
you're on the road.
- i don't see you for weeks.
- i'm working. it's not a vacation.
- it goes on. nothing changes.
- i need these dates.
- i got a million-dollar hole.
- that you dug for yourself.
he was screwing things up.
we had to get him out.
- don't talk about things you don't know.
- he used you.
he ridiculed you. he did everything
he could to destroy the group.
- and you take his debts?
- he couldn't help himself!
oh, my god.
saint francis, is that it?
kind to animals?
i thought if you could get out of the
neighborhood maybe we'd have a shot.
but you're never
gonna get out, are you?
what if we got married?
you and tommy? i don't
think that's legal in nevada.
- you don't give an inch, do you?
- i'm never gonna be first in line.
i'm always gonna be standing behind
tommy and bobby and nicky and joey.
look, i gotta go.
go tomorrow.
come to boston.
we'll spend the weekend.
i can't. i got things.
yeah, i know. family and work.
and what's left, frankie?
don't do this. not now.
why?
so we can have a drink?
go around one more time?
i'm sorry, sweetheart.
i gotta get off the merry-go-round.
it's no fun anymore.
fourteen nine, 14,950, 15,000.
okay, we're good.
everybody's whole now, right?
frankie, you know it
was nothing personal.
gyp: norm...
say goodbye.
take care, gentlemen.
i told you, if you do the work,
everything follows.
heh.
thanks.
- long life.
- long life.
long life.
[phone ringing]
ah. it's my daughter francine.
she calls every friday at 10.
that's good, frankie.
she's playing victoria's
in plainfield.
francine, just a second, okay?
just a minute.
okay.
- all right. call me later.
- all right.
thanks again.
francine, you'll never
guess who was just here.
- excuse me?
<i>- officer: you're the father of francine valli?</i>
yes, this is her father.
<i>this is the new york
police department.</i>
is something wrong? is she all right?
[priest speaking indistinctly]
[sobs]
for this is our god,
forever and ever.
get you a plaque on this booth.
how you doing?
never better.
yeah.
i got something i
think belongs to you.
open it.
crewe and i got together.
[sighs]
bob, i just buried a child.
you want me to sing a love song?
you gotta climb out
of this, frankie. it'll kill you.
she had a bigger range than me.
did you know that?
and in here, she had it.
what was i supposed to do,
put her on a leash?
chain her to the bed?
they grow up, they go out...
and some stu cazzo with a bottle
of pills is waiting and it's over.
don't blame yourself.
really?
who, then?
all right, look.
do me a favor.
just take it home.
look at it.
there's something not right in the
release. maybe you'll have an idea.
- bob, i don't know.
- just look at it.
here. wear this, would you?
we don't need you
catching pneumonia too.
[phone rings]
yeah.
you know, the problem is you're
modulating up after the bridge...
- ...and i don't think you should. you listening?
- yeah. go ahead.
<i>yeah, you know, your music...</i>
and crewe's lyric,
they're working really well together.
you know, you goose it up too much,
i don't know, it gets cheesy.
maybe a few notes here and there.
all right. well, uh...
why don't you come over
tomorrow and we'll talk about it?
check my schedule.
good idea.
okay, people, take five.
five-minute break.
i sprung for the session.
what else do you want?
release the song.
i don't know what to do with it.
it's too hard for pop, too soft for rock.
but, al, it's a new kind of song.
you're the president of a record company.
do the right thing. find the next thing.
what are you busting my chops?
you drag me down to hear some art
song that's never gonna get airplay.
okay, listen to me.
frankie's going through hell.
we've made you a lot of money.
come on. do the right thing.
because deep down, very,
very, very deep down...
i know that you are a
decent human being.
i'll be candid with you, my friend.
frankie's okay. he's no neil sedaka.
then i want out of our contract.
and i'm taking you to court
to get back our masters.
you don't have the balls.
try me.
okay. call me sentimental.
here's the deal:
you get some stations to play it,
i'll release the damn song.
they say no...
you take your work of art and stick
it where the sun don't shine.
thank you, al, you're a class act.
it's very nice. say hi to the kids.
merry christmas.
engineer: okay, folks, we're back.
- so how did that go?
- good. very good.
noise. so where do you
wanna break the song?
- detroit. the roostertail.
- detroit. that's wjr.
i know that guy. marty something.
mr. first nighter.
three hundred pounds. disgusting.
so we get him in there...
we lay on the food, we lay on the booze,
we give him the full treatment.
the guy's a moron,
but he's not stupid.
he hears the crowd,
you'll get airplay. don't worry.
- that's just detroit.
- let me finish.
so we follow up.
philly, boston,
chicago, san francisco.
you start a little movement.
people start talking.
they talk more.
it's a chain reaction.
"where did you find that song?"
all right.
stations start getting calls.
"we wanna hear that song."
"where is that song?"
"what is wrong with you people?"
okay, everybody.
"play the fucking song already!"

[cheering]
[crowd shouting and cameras clicking]
[crowd cheering]
wow.
nothing's changed except
for frankie, right?
hey, hey. so you guys haven't
sung together in how long?
- nick: twenty-five years.
- twelve years.
- since 1912.
- now that you sing your songs...
what's different?
the keys. they're a little lower.
not for you, but for us.
are the songs tougher,
more meaning, different meaning?
this is the first time we've sung
together tonight in a long time.
so we'll find out tonight.
- good to know. thanks.
- man: is that tommy?
hey, there's tommy.
journalist: there's tommy.
bob: hello, sir.
- good to see you.
- bobby, good to see you.
- tommooch.
- machoch.
good to see you.
so i haven't seen these guys in ages.
good to see you, frankie.
how's life, tommy?
i can't complain.
here.
all right. all right, tommy.
[crowd chattering]
let's go inside.
<i>crewe: it's been over 20 years...</i>
since these guys have appeared
on the same stage together...
and what better stage for
a reunion than this one?
ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...
my old friends and
brand-new hall of famers:
the original four seasons!
[audience cheering]
[singing]
<i>rag doll, ooh</i>
<i>i love you just the way you are</i>
<i>hand-me-down</i>
<i>when she was just a kid
her clothes were hand-me-downs</i>
<i>hand-me-down</i>
<i>they always laughed at her
when she came into town</i>
you know what i do now?
i work for joe pesci.
little joey fishes. same kid
i used to smack around.
couple of months ago we're driving
through the old neighborhood.
he says, "hey, tommy, how do you
remember yourself back then?"
i says:
"i think i was a
pretty stand-up guy."
he says, "i gotta be honest with you.
you were a total prick.
nobody would have put up with your
shit except we all needed something."
everybody remembers it the
way they need to, right?
people always ask the same question:
"why'd you do it, nicky?
why'd you walk away?"
well, let me clear that up.
it wasn't the side deal.
it wasn't the touring.
it wasn't the bad food
or rooming with tommy.
it just came out of my mouth.
once i said it...
i knew it was what i wanted.
i wanted to go home.
they ask you what was the high point?
hall of fame?
selling all those records?
pulling "sherry" out of the hat?
it was all great.
but four guys under a streetlamp...
when it was all still ahead of us...
first time we made that sound...
our sound...
when everything dropped away
and all there was was the music...
that was the best.
i'm not drawn to the
old neighborhood...
my life never revolved around
the old neighborhood...
i don't give a fuck about
the old neighborhood.
i'm from wherever i happen to be.
and these days,
that's nashville, tennessee.
just me...
my beautiful wife...
and a good cigar.
quiet and peaceful...
in the knowledge...
that none of this could
have happened...
without me.
by the way...
you're ever in vegas, go to any casino,
say the name tommy devito.
my hand to god...
you'll be out of there
in about 12 seconds.
all right, i'll be honest with you.
it could have been an ego thing.
everybody wants to be up front.
but if there's four guys...
and you're ringo...?
better i should spend
some time with my kids.
like that bunny on tv with the battery,
i just keep going and going and going.
chasing the music.
trying to get home.
