<i>...want it that way</i>
don't look at me when
you sing that part.
feel it!
ugh.
<i>that way</i>
man,
that was pretty fun.
what happened, man?
it's not a solo group. i
needed you up there with me.
that's why none of those
kids had solo careers.
i meant us.
what are you talking about?
remember when we
first moved here...
and we said if we didn't make
it by the time we were 30...
we would move back to ohio?
remember that?
yeah.
we're 30 as shit right now.
and tomorrow you're gonna
sell your game, j.
that's a guarantee, dude.
and also, they're running
my commercial again.
why would you want
them to run that?
what do you mean?
it's great exposure.
is it?
i have.
i have.
i have.
genital herpes.
dude, i got $11,000
from that commercial.
i've been living
off that for 2 years.
oh, just go talk to her,
you pussy.
you want me to open for you?
i do not.
i'll be happy to open for you.
the last girl you had sex
with was 55 years old.

into this, dude.
what was i supposed to say?
"hi, i'm a 30-year-old assistant
at a video game company."
"wanna meet my roommate?"

what's up, guys?
how's everybody doing?
everybody's good?
cool. cool. um...
this...
is a character-driven
action game.
but don't think of it as a game.
think of it as
a real life experience.
you are a cop,
put in real life...
okay, stop. stop.
shut that shit off.
okay.
spare me the corny gimmicks.
what's the game about?
um, it's called "patrolman."
patrol-man. huh.
i like that. what kind of
superpowers does he have?
check out this girl's pussy.
oh, no, it's a cop, so he doesn't
have any superpowers or anything.
what does he have?
is he a vampire,
or anything original?
you know
what's original?
firefighters.
yes.
firefighters? okay.
who wants to be a cop?
i wanna shoot at cops.
i don't wanna be one.
good point.
if i can just show
you guys the game.
cops are actually really cool.
no, they're not.
shut up.
you know what's really cool?
zombies.
i want you to start working on
"firefighters versus zombies."
that's genius.
boom!
what if it was a war between
firefighters and zombies?
post-apocalyptic.
set it in new york city and destroy manhattan.
hey. you writing this down?
<i>all right,
we can win this!</i>
razor-15! 1-4-5! hut!
mississippi, 3 mississippi...
i'm open!

shut up!
why don't you shut up, ron?
who is that guy?
some loser.
he shows up every day and
he thinks he's our coach.
ron's getting in my
fucking head, dude.
hello?
ow!
why would you do that?
why'd you hit me in the face?
you don't jump out on brothers.
we don't like that,
you know that!
i was just trying to show you
the costume for tonight.
god!
so how did we do today?
they... bought it.
green light.
yeah!
oh, i'm so happy for you!
i knew it! yeah!
and that's why we're going
to the party tonight in style.
do you really wanna do that?
it's gonna be like
a college reunion.
yes!
i don't know, man.
i mean, they're throwing a costume
party in the middle of june.
that's what the e-vite said.
i don't know.
it doesn't make sense.
i'll tell you what makes sense.
us kicking ass and taking names.
we're ghosts.
you look ridiculous.
then how about those?
my cop stuff?
no.
why not?
no.
then how about this, you fucking downer...
cops or ghosts?
your choice.
we look ridiculous.
what are you talking about?
we look badass.
i feel like danny glover before
he got too old for this shit.
these vests are really heavy.
because they're
real bulletproof vests.
they are?
yeah.
so all this is real?
everything.
what about the guns?
are the guns real?
yeah, but they don't fire.
what is the point of that?
the police are here.
you idiot.
why am i an idiot?
because this is not a costume
party, it's a masquerade party.
that's the same thing.
not the same thing.
not the same thing.
okay, relax.
not the same thing.
where are you going?
hey, man! congrats!
oh, it's justin!
hey!
ryan said you were a big time
video game designer now.

i'm officer segars,
this is officer jackson.
sorry, sergeant, we should
have called it in first.
well, goddamn it, guys!
don't let it happen again, all right?
that's amateur hour.
yes, sir.
yes, sir.
look, i don't mean to scold you.
i was young and
hungry once, too.
i get it.
i'm officer o'malley.
this is my best friend
and partner, officer chang.
best friend, huh, and partner?
oh, i wish i could say the same.
listen, i'm kind of
embarrassed about this.
is there any way i can make it up to you?
we're about to get off.
how about we take you guys out
and buy you a couple of drinks?
oh...
to a cool cop bar?
yeah, it's the coolest.
if you're buying, we're drinking.
i don't have any money on me.
well, yeah, the first round.
i'm sorry. unfortunately,
we're a little tired.
we had a long day, so we're...
i don't know if you
guys got the memo...
but chang here is
a bit of a whang.
hey, let me tell you something.
jackson here is no peach either.
non-stop donut farts.
never a dull moment,
am i right, sarge?
dude, no!
we're code 6. let's go.
no, no, no.
what are you doing?
we're getting their six.
no, we're not!
wanna take the lead
on this, sarge?
me? no, you guys
go ahead.
i'm gonna evaluate you guys,
individually and as a team.

holy shit.
lapd!
los angeles police department!
shh, shh.
let's go.
no, no, no.

i'm crawling.
ow.

i don't know.

okay, great.

what is he saying?
they're going in
from the west perimeter
and we're going to
the east perimeter.
no, we're not going to any perimeter.
copy that.
dude, ryan!
no, no, no!
your gun's fake.
let's go.
shut the fuck up.
your gun's not real.
don't touch a shooter's arm!
come on, pig motherfuckers!
don't call us pigs!
where did you get that?
you wanna get weird,
let's get weird.
oh, my god!
hold on!
hold it!
hold it.
hold it.
just take off, all right?
we're not gonna chase you.
stay right here.
we are gonna chase you.
do not listen to him.
he's an idiot.
he's an idiot.
you can go.
we are police officers.
i promise you
we won't chase you.
i promise we will chase you,
and i promise i'll
catch you, you rat.
don't look at him.
i swear to you...
i pinky swear,
we will not chase you.
i pinky swear.
just touch it.
he almost did it!
oh, my god.
okay.
let me just get this straight.
did you just
pinky-swear with a perp?
yeah.
that's the most embarrassing
thing i've ever lived through!
what are you talking about?
did you see how strong he was?
he looked like pacquiao
and fabio had a baby!
take him, sarge, take him!
go ahead. this one's all you.
nope.
go ahead.
nope.
you got it, sarge!
watch and learn.
<i>i came in like a wrecking ball</i>
oh, shit!
<i>i never hit so hard at love</i>
<i>all i wanted was
to break your walls</i>
oh, my god!
<i>all you ever did was wreck me</i>
oh, my god!
<i>yeah, you, you wreck me</i>
wait, wait, wait.
hold, hold, hold.
let me up!
let me up!
come here.
there you go!
way to go, chang!
where is the other guy?
what?
what other guy? what
are you talking about?
the other perp.
i think it was just that guy.
you pinky swear about that?
there were 2.
yeah, 2.
let's find them
then, guys! come on!
you take the front, we'll
take the back, all right?
- yep, absolutely.
- all right.
all right!
chang. do not
tom cruise run.
yeah!
whoo! that is living, man!
i still taste that guy's
sweat in my mouth.
congratulations. that is
the taste of victory, man.
it's your first collar, dude.
dude, that was way too close.
seriously.
what's the worst that could happen?
"simply wearing
a police badge is
punishable by 1 year
minimum in a federal..."
what the fuck?
"the use of official
police equipment...
is punishable by up to 2 years
in a federal penitentiary."
"driving a vehicle with red or
blue lights is punishable...
by up to 3 years imprisonment
and $200,000 fine."
what about a whole
damn police car?
<i>everybody get down</i>
which one of you little pricks
asked me what i do all day?
i'm a cop.
joey, hop in.
out of my way.
take a lap, little boys.
he's a cop, ron!
he ain't shit!
i love it, man.
look, you had a great shift.
you keep it up...
and i'll give you
that badge i promised you.
what the hell
have you been doing?
jesus, you scared
the shit out of me.
and who is this?
it's joey.
he's our intern.
ryan, are you insane?
no.
we could go to jail for
years for this shit.
and now you have
a little kid involved?
who's this bitch?
i will slap that little
afro off your head.
you're good. dude,
this is it, all right?
take the uniform off.
we're throwing them away.
we are done. seriously.
you wanna retire?
shit.
this is chang.
you're good.
<i>i need you to come down here
right away. i'm at georgie's.</i>
wait. what's wrong, josie?
please come down as
soon as you can. hurry.
yeah, but just
tell... hello?
damn it.
did you hear that?
looks like we're coming out
of retirement, homeboy.
we gotta go around back
to surprise them.
all right,
here's what we're gonna do.
i'm gonna bum-rush in, i'm
gonna say my killer line...
then you come in and
repeat everything i said.
no.
ready, and...
yippee-ki-yay, bitches!
everyone down!
yippee-ki-yay, bitches...
everyone...
so you're the new
sheriffs in town.
acting all hard
when i'm not here.
well, i'm here now.
huh.
are you the new boyfriend?
can i talk to you
for a second, please?
all right, boyfriend.
all right.
my buddy's gonna handle this.
okay?
that's real steel. you
don't mess with the chang.
listen, you gotta
leave her alone now.
i'm not even talking to you
like a police officer.
this is just me talking to
you like a regular guy.
so this is you without a badge?
yeah. it's just
man-to-man.
okay, let's backtrack a little bit.
so i'm a cop now...
you did it again. yep.
you think you can
fuck with my business?
are you threatening me?
i'm a cop, asshole.
you ain't shit.
what? you wanna jump?
come on, bitch, let's go.
let's do it.
come on, let's go.
jump.
you're not worth the paperwork.
i'm the law here.
back off...
of everything.
next time you come
to a call like this...
who knows?
bullets fly.
cops get hit all the time.
all right, so we're
just gonna come clean
and tell these guys everything.
everything except for the fact that
we've been pretending to be cops.
what? no.
it's called
taking responsibility.
this shit has gone way too far.
it sounds stupid, man.
it's not stupid.
it is stupid.
it's smart. by
principle, it's stupid.
justin, you could still stop right now.
shut up.
hi. listen i don't know
where to begin...
i should probably do the
talking here... shh.
i guess we want to
file a police report.
mmm-hmm.
what kind of report?
uh, he and i have been pretending to
be cops for the past couple of weeks.
excuse me?
it sounds crazy.
mmm-hmm.
yeah. it started out
just as fun...
but now we're in a lot of
trouble and we need help.
from real cops.
hold on a second there, angie.
don't believe
a word these guys say.
oh, fuck.
these guys are a couple
of real jokers!
let me guess.
you guys came down here to help
me fill out all that paperwork...
you ditched us with
the other night, am i right?
that's right, yeah.
no.
good to see you guys again.
come on back.
we're gonna go back.
this guy is a rascal.
no, i'm being serious.
we're really not cops.
that's not funny.
george segars, he said
don't worry about it.
help me. please!
see you, angie.
we're not cops.
it's not funny.
his name's
mossi kasic.
he's top of the shitlist.
i'm surprised you guys
haven't heard of him.
i deal with guys like this
on a daily basis, segars.
i hear you, sarge
but this guy is different.
he runs a crew,
preys on local shop owners...
and immigrants like himself.
he muscles in...
takes co-ownership
of the businesses...
and then uses it for money
laundering and whatnot.
he's an animal.
<i>hey, beautiful.</i>
<i>you can't reason
with him, can't talk to him.</i>
he loves to fight.
he lives for it.
he's got this crazy temper.
he can snap, just like that.
it's all right.
he's taken down
some big scores.
everytime we raid his place, though...
nothing.
we can't find
anything on the inside.
i gotta say,
i want this guy bad.
it's good to hear.
i want him bad, too.
i think about it every night.
me, too.
i just lay awake,
staring at the ceiling...
just thinking about
different ways to nail him.
i'm obsessed with
nailing this dude.
i wanna put him up on the wall,
you know, and just...
"what's my name?"
that's right.
anyways, that's probably
never gonna happen.
what's going on, guys?
nothing. we were just
talking about mossi.
nobody in the community's
gonna testify against him...
and without hard evidence,
we got nothing.
so why don't we do surveillance?
believe me, i'd love to do that, but
it's a little bit above my pay grade.
right.
however...
between you and me, sarge...
everything is.
this station has
a shitload of equipment.
i'm talking about wiretaps,
pinhole cameras,
anything you want,
i can get for you.
i want all of it.
all right.
let's do it. yeah!
hey, sarge, <i>brothers in
blue,</i> should we sing it?
sing what?
it's the academy song. come on.
oh, yeah, yeah.
fire it up.
<i>brothers in blue</i>
that's good. this guy
never stops, does he?
there's a police song?
i gotta learn that.
you're a fucking idiot.
we were supposed
to turn ourselves in
and now your
checking out equipment?
dude, you heard the cop.
it's up to us to get this guy.
he is the devil's nephew.
we're not going near that guy!
so let me get this straight.
you finally meet
a girl that you like...
and she likes you, and then
some douchebag comes around...
and says that you
can't be with her...
and your first
thought is to run away?
yes. he said
he would kill me.
i'm not gonna let
you run away, man.
you know what?
what?
you wanna know
what people say about you?
i know what they say.
but i haven't felt like
this in a long time.
i'm good at this.
i need you, man.
i need you to...
i need you to
believe in me, man.
please.
i'm in.
were you about to cry?
yeah, i don't
wanna talk about it.
i got misty, my heart
started pumping fast.
so how are we
gonna find this guy?
this is it.
god, i'm getting good
at this detective stuff.
is that why you're
wearing that suit?
oh, yeah, i got promoted.
you promoted yourself again?
yeah. i'm a detective.
what do you think
they're doing in there?
i don't know, man. something
shady, that's for sure.
let's see if we can get
inside and open those doors.
let's see if we don't do that.
listen, chang...
you've gotta stop
being such a pussy, okay?
yeah, no shit.
dude...
i will whoop your little ass.
you will not touch his ass.
i will hit him.
don't you fucking hit me.
don't!
oh, perfect.
if i wasn't involved in a case
right now, i would light you up.
that right there, that apartment,
that's our vantage point.
but somebody lives in there.
justin, then they
better have good food...
because they're about to be
involved in their first stakeout!
no.
police business,
open up now.
hi.
hi.
you are a fox, aren't you?
detective?
absolutely, that's my title.
dude.
uh, ma'am, we're gonna need to come inside
and talk to you for a minute, please.
- oh.
- all right.
oh, yeah.
it smells like
a fish farted in here.
look at that bald one.
he looks super racist.
like he snores
the "n" word at night.
i've seen every cop show ever.
i'm so excited we're going
to be doing this together.
yeah.
just so we're clear, there's
no "we" in this situation.
don't be a dick.
i can still be a part of
the team though, right?
absolutely.
no.
also, i'm not on ecstasy.
no way.
i've had some very
dramatic relationships.
my therapist says i need
to meet a more stable guy.
i love a man in uniform.
you do?
sure.
i don't like this.
i did a three-way once
with two paramedics.
ma'am, i'm going to need
you to go to your room.
all right.
alone.
you do not know
what vibage is, pal.
why would you do that?
i think she's an interesting lady and
she's got a lot to offer this team.
we are doing surveillance.
we don't have time.
ow.
all right,
we got action, people.
oh, good work, joe.
who is that?
i think he's the boss.
take photos of his henchmen.
you got good ones?
how fun is this?
i'm sorry to bother you,
but i need some help.
it's my bubble bath.
it's not wet enough.
no.
yes. that's our
civic duty.
no, it's not. focus.
we would love to help you,
ma'am, but we can't...
because we're on a case and
we take our job seriously.
that is so hot.
you're so hot.
<i>listen to me very carefully.</i>
<i>i need you to lay low.</i>
<i>very low.</i>
<i>for now.</i>
the dominicans are
going to make the delivery.
and you're not going to do
shit with it until i say so.
understood?
<i>you gonna keep
everything underground.</i>
underground?
what is he talking about?
deliver what?
i don't know.
what's this?
this is the shipment.
this is our evidence.
how do you know that?
because it's a cargo van,
and these are all bad guys.
these guys are
terrible-looking people.
open it.
oh...
shit.
so?
they tell me their badge
numbers don't match up.
which tells me one thing.
they're not lapd.
oh, we're dead.
so, what are they?
feds, atf, maybe a special unit.
what?
yeah, we're black ops, dude.
so, you're going to be invisible
until i can figure it out.
just to be clear...
if that little
guy wasn't here...
some serious weird shit
would be going on right now.
what kind of weird shit?
you are an
acrobatic angel, aren't you?
ah.
joey, turn around.
oh!
okay.
there she goes.
boom, we got them.
now what's in those crates?
i'm seeing it the same time you're
seeing it. how would i know that?
i need to narrate it, because that's
what you do in these situations.
you see something and one of
the guys says it out loud.
and the other guy, you, is
supposed to go, "yeah."
oh, shit, dude. we gotta
know what's inside those crates.
so, what do we do now?
joey, watch the fort.
where are you going?
wait a minute, actually.
oh...
that is so hot.
there he is.
this is a terrible idea.
is it?
dude, are you kidding?
no.
he's a gang member.
exactly.
relax, i'm just
gonna go talk to him.
i will not relax.
you're an idiot.
i got this.
hello.
you have the right to remain silent...
here we go.
justin, help me now!
anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.
you have the right
to an attorney.
if you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed...
he's biting my neck!
he's biting my neck!
ow!
can i talk
to you for a second?
sure.
what the fuck!
we've gotta find out
what's in those crates.
are you kidding me?
i'm not...
no!
get in!
get in the car!
okay.
so we're kidnapping people now?
no, justin, it's called
an interrogation.
where are we going
to interrogate him?
he's just a friend.
he's just a friend.
we gotta get the information out
of him about what's in those crates.
he doesn't even
speak english, dude.
then we torture him.
you're the mysterious one.
you have to be bad cop.
so now i'm torturing him?
hey, who said anything
about torture, your honor?
you just did 3 seconds ago.
shut up, dude.
this is
a serious moment.
make him talk.
you can do it.
all right.
you can do it!
yeah, born ready!
listen to me,
you little dick-snatch...
what was that?
he spit in my face.
he's not afraid of me.
you know what, then
make him afraid of you.
<i>reservoir dogs,</i> dude.
cut the ear.
be realistic for once.
lift up that side.
i'm trying.
what's in those crates?
what's in those crates?
this is not how you waterboard.
yes it is!
have you seen <i>zero dark thirty?</i>
no, but i know
how to waterboard, though.
stop drinking it!
what the hell, man?
it's sad what you're trying to do.
it's embarrassing.
all right.
i hate mossi.
everybody does. i'll tell you
anything you want to know.
just stop this shit!
why didn't you say that before?
and that you spoke english.
you didn't ask. you guys
pulled me out of my truck.
you drag me across
the fucking ground.
that's on me.
you throw me in
the back of a cop car.
point the guns in my face!
look, maybe we got off
on the wrong foot here.
yeah, maybe.
you want a beer?
yeah, beer sounds good.
what's your name?
my name is pupa.
if we untie you, do you promise
not to freak out and kill us?
i promise not to freak out.
ah, man!
for real, i don't know
what's in those crates.
but mossi paid some heavy
cash for whatever's in there.
but how do we find out?
mossi's having one of his parties tonight.
i hear shit gets crazy.
at least 3 people die,
everytime he has a party.
what?
those crates will be there...
but if you wait until tomorrow
that shit's going to be gone.
so we gotta do it tonight.
you gotta do it tonight.
shit, this game is gangster!
really? gangster?
it is, man, i tell you.
where can i buy this thing?
you see, pupa,
it's kind of complicated.
there's a lot that goes into
making games these days.
oh, justin.
a lot of politics. i'm
talking to a lot of people.
it sounds like you bitched
out, is what it sounds like.
you gotta go in there
and fight for your shit.
don't you believe in yourself?
you gotta go in
there and tell them...
"this is my game. we're
going to do it my way."
"put the game out there now,
for people to buy it."
i gotta say, we have to
get into that party.
we gotta get in
that party tonight.
i don't understand
what you're saying.
when you start getting excited,
your english escapes you...
and you get really
native in your tongue.
how do we get into that party?
when i'm speaking english but it still
sounds like...
like that, i don't
what you're saying.
you didn't get
any of that?
<i>qué?</i>
you didn't get any...
<i>qué?</i>
holy shit.
what?
what?
this is gonna sound
a little bit weird...
but you two could
pass as brothers.
ew! no,
this guy's gross!
no offense.
no offense?
you just said, "ew."
the last person who said,
"ew" to me, was my mother.
hmm.
you guys know
where she is right now?
heaven?
you got it.
heaven.
hopefully from natural causes?
if me getting angry and doing something
foolish is natural causes...
then yes.
you look handsome.
thank you.
a great-looking guy.
now i'm here to play war.
hey, chang.
how do i make you...
look like him?
shit.
how much time we got?
uh...
shut up.
i need a water, three bowls and a lemon
peel. come on, people, let's go!
that's my girl.
she said she'd done a three-way
with a couple of paramedics.
mmm-hmm i think this
the marrying type.
sounds like it to me.
all right.
are you ready?
we're ready.
oh, ho-ho.
that's handsome.
well...
i look like someone hit me
in the face with lil wayne.
lil wayne!
he made a joke about lil wayne!
oh, shit! that's funny.
hey, josie, i gotta say
you're one heck of an artist.
- thank you.
- you're fine, too, girl.
yeah, she's pretty.
josie, josie,
look at me. look at me.
don't do intense right now.
okay.
you're crazy fine,
that's all i'm saying.
that's a compliment,
now let it go.
just gonna
say one more thing.
i wouldn't, though,
is what i'm saying.
i promise it's going to be okay.
i mean, i would like
to take off your dress...
and put my penis inside of you.
i'd really like to
get all up in that shit.
no, like in her vagina, though.
i know, but you can't say that.
appreciate it.
i wouldn't put it in your butt.
- i gotta go.
- and a good day to you, <i>madame.</i>
do you think i could put "undercover sting
operation for the lapd" on my resume?
absolutely.
did you see when i said
<i>"madame?"</i> that's french.
that was sweet.
here you go, buddy.
what if i start sweating, dude?
these tattoos are
gonna run down my face.
then don't sweat.
what do you mean, "don't
sweat?" i'm not doing this.
why you got to be such a bitch?
pupa, don't call me a bitch.
you made such a cool game. if you
make it, then you got to play it.
i've been saying
that this whole time.
you made such a cool game,  now you gotta play it.
what are you doing
with your accent?
what are you
doing with your voice?
i was agreeing with you.
but you have an accent.
i know you are agreeing with me,
but you're saying it like i was.
what i'm saying is, you made a
great game and i believe in you.
so, now, you just gotta
play it.
all right, dude.
feel free to rob him.
oh, boy. he can't hear you. i'm just
going to ignore him from now on.
how is this on me?
this is insane.
listen, justin,
no matter what happens...
no matter what
anyone says to you,
all you gotta say to them is...
what does that mean?
it means, "suck my balls
and cock, you cocksucker."
yeah, just say that.
okay.
good luck, homes. you're gonna need it.
look, i'm telling you,
we look a lot alike.
but mossi is probably gonna
recognize that you're not me...
and then he gonna
cut your face off!
all right. is that...?
what are you talking about?
whoo! i'm sorry.
it's not funny.
wait a second.
what?
one extra
touch for you.
pretty good, right here.
oh god, no.
just trust him.
put it in.
you put this in your mouth.
ow. ryan!
you'll need it.
you need it, man.
here they come.
ow. ow. aah!
i'm going to die here.
it smells like prison
and bad parenting.
oh! oh!
<i>relax! you'll be in and out.</i>
all we gotta do is find out what's
in those crates and you'll be done.
we'll get footage of it,
and you're out.
that's easy for you to say.
they are all staring at me.
then stare back at them.
you are a <i>cholo vato</i> killer!
<i>own that shit!</i>
i suck balls and cock.
ah.
<i>coño.</i>
that's what i thought. ah,
dude, i think it's working!
hell yeah, chang!
you tell them!
<i>nice! okay, we're in!</i>
<i>dude, those chicks are hot.</i>
shut up, dude.
i'm freaking out.
<i>just relax. be like everybody
else or you'll stand out.</i>
<i>good.</i>
<i>dude! what are you doing?</i>
i'm doing my white girl dance.
<i>stop doing that shit!</i>
there's got to be some sort
of back room or storage area.
you've got some
balls coming in here.
come with me.
mossi's gonna
wanna speak to you.
been looking for you.
okay.
shit, what do i do?
<i>i don't know,
but don't be nervous.</i>
<i>but don't fuck it up, either.</i>
the fuck are you doing here?
i best not be finding out
you lost one of my crates.
<i>make him say
what's in those crates!</i>
um...
what exactly are we referring
to in those crates, bro?
hit this shit.
nah, bro. i'm already
super piped-out.
i was like, this pipe,
that pipe, every pipe.
you know what i'm saying?
you feel me? <i>coño.</i>
i didn't ask.
<i>just do it, dude.
he's testing you.</i>
you just got cranked up, fool.
ryan, what did i just smoke?
what does "cranked up" mean?
you just smoked
crystal meth, dude.
crystal meth?
<i>it's not going to affect you.</i>
it's not going to affect me?
what are you talking about?
<i>right there! they have a basement!
you gotta go down there.</i>
no way, dude. frigging
twitching right now.
<i>do not puss out now!</i>
i'm pussing out.
listen to me.
you gotta go down there
and see what that was.
you listen to me, all right?
i'm having a heart
attack right here!
<i>all right,
just open up that window.</i>
okay. okay.
why'd you hit me in the face for?
it's me!
move! i've got an
awesome entrance.
fuck, yeah!
that wasn't cool.
what the fuck are you wearing?
here's where we're at.
i did some intel, and that's
their safehouse down there.
as the leader in our situation,
i'm gonna check that out first.
you're gonna hang out in the
hallway and stand guard, okay?
what? no, dude,
i'm on crystal meth!
i know, it's awesome.
i'm very jealous of that.
how fun is it? i've done it 11 times.
eleven?
and i smoked crack once.
let's go!
no, please.
don't leave me alone here.
please, i'm itching.
i've got this post-nasal
drip thing going.
don't do that!
you're gonna make me...
don't... hey!
think about something else.
think about apple pie.
i've got to take my teeth out.
i gotta take the hat off.
i gotta take this thing off my ear.
wig off.
okay, come on.
what the hell are you doing?
oh, shit.
i can't stop twitching.
okay, just don't think about it.
it's a mind thing.
okay.
come on, j.
i'm so scared.
hold my hand.
i'm not holding your hand.
dude, i think i'm
addicted to crystal meth.
you just smoked it once.
oh, my god. i would suck
dick for this high.
you've got to be kidding.
i wouldn't, but what if i do?
i don't want to suck dick.
because i know i'm
gonna get good at it.
oh!
shit!
look at all these lights!
not the lights. we're excited
about the guns, right?
right. right.
holy shit.
justin, it's the crates.
check it out.
jackpot, dude.
jack-motherfucking-pot.
see these tags?
yeah, man.
you know what these are?
these were confiscated
by the police.
yeah.
they were supposed to destroy this shit.
he stole all this.
i feel real good right now.
i want to build a porch.
we should build a porch!
right now! that'd be great.
right.
i don't even know if i'm good
at woodwork or anything...
but i feel like i can do that.
mmm.
dude, look at me.
hey! hey!
hey, hey.
you wanna go crazy, dude?
no.
neither do i.
thank you. that makes
me feel like a leader.
holy shit.
you know what this is?
clothes.
this is actual swat gear, man.
let's be real. we're never
gonna build a porch.
we're just lying
to ourselves, man.
i just want to die, dude.
what the hell is going
on with you, man?
something's going on inside my heart.
it hurts.
let's go, meth head, now.
i'm sorry.
now!
i'm sorry, man.
i feel so sad!
stop.
whoa.
look at how far this one goes.
what are you doing?
this is so white trash, i don't
even know what i'm saying.
what is that sound?
our heroes rise from
the depths of hades!
stop, dude. you're
getting so scary.
hey, man, where
are you going? wait up.
i got it. mossi looks like
the original general zod.
hey!
aah!
hey.
you and me, right now.
wait!
i'll rip your head off!
timeout, okay?
seriously, guys!
uh-huh.
who's next?
fuck.
check it out.
it's a jackpot.
what?
look, with the guns...
with the swat, and mossi's boss,
i got all his guys pinned.
i've got enough evidence to
put this guy away for years.
that's great, man.
remember that long tunnel?
see where it leads?
it leads to georgie's.
oh.
that's why he
wants georgie's so bad.
it's not about money laundering.
it's about having control...
of both ends of the tunnel.
do you see?
why?
that's the right question.
do you remember segars said that
every time that they raid mossi...
they come up with nothing.
he's using the tunnel as an escape
route to get rid of all the stuff.
i cracked the case, man.
i'm getting so good
at this that it's scary.
where are you going with that?
to the police station,
to turn it in.
no, you're not.
we're mailing it in...
anonymously like we said.
justin, come on.
this is my collar.
no one can know this was us.
what is wrong with you?
i worked hard on this.
why are you
getting so pissed off?
because i almost died in there!
all right.
look at my face!
i smoked crystal meth!
that's not funny!
all right.
and for what? so you could
have some self-worth for once?
where is this coming from, man?
i didn't do this for my
self-worth or whatever!
i did it to get a guy like
mossi off the streets...
and we're going to!
unlike you, who runs away...
anytime anything
in your life gets tough!
and maybe that's why
you're still nowhere.
oh, i'm still nowhere? me?
yeah, you.
you've been moping
around for 8 years!
complaining about, "oh, life screwed me.
that's why i didn't go pro."
life did screw me.
that's why i didn't go pro.
you jumped off
a roof at a pool party.
that's how you injured yourself.
be careful of where
you're going right now.
life didn't screw you.
you screwed yourself.
take some
responsibility for once.
why don't you act
like a man for once,
because you might
like the way it feels.
you know what?
everyone was right about you.
about what?
you're a loser.
be a man.
all right, okay.
i'll show you what a man does.
i'll show you what a man does!
you got mossi?
i got him.
wow.
in this envelope, i got
enough hard evidence...
to put away mossi kasic
for a lot of years.
holy cow!
you and chang make
a great team, you know?
yeah.
i gotta get this in the right
hands right away. can you help?
detective brolin.
you've heard of him.
he's in charge of the organized crime
division. he's gonna love this.
might as well go
straight to the top.
straight to the top.
let's do this.
mmm.
what's up, baby girl?
carl, park in my spot one more time
and i'm gonna punch you in the dick.
larry! fuck you!
okay. okay.
okay!
all right!
there he is.
detective brolin.
i would like you to meet
sergeant o'malley.
o'malley, this is
detective brolin.
pleasure.
yeah.
have a seat.
sergeant o'malley says he's
got some hard evidence...
on mossi kasic.
enough to take him
and his whole crew down.
there's some things
in here i didn't put...
it's okay.
it's okay. i wanna take
a look at it anyway.
sergeant o'malley has been
doing some surveillance...
of mossi and his crew
for quite awhile now.
i think he's got some
good stuff in there, sir.
he seems pretty
excited about it.
give us a minute alone.
yes, sir.
not you.
relax.
who are you?
i asked a question.
who are you?
before you do anything, i
already made copies of that.
do you have a family?
are your parents still alive?
yeah, my parents
are alive... no.
i am running a routine
undercover investigation...
to bring down mossi kasic...
and you're interfering.
that's not true.
oh, it's not true?
no.
well, whoever you are...
i suggest you run,
very far away...
and grow eyes in
the back of your head...
because you're never gonna
know when it's coming.
do you know who i am?
i'm the guy who's gonna...
take me down.
you've been
watching too many movies.
yeah.
but i'm still
gonna take you down.
so i guess we'll see.
i guess we'll see.
hey, o'malley,
where are you going?
i forgot something
in my car, segars.
wow.
this sucks shit.
this isn't cool.
when i came up
with it, it was cool.
where are their superpowers?
we can give the
firefighters superpowers.
it's just...
it's just what?
it's just your
idea sucks shit, todd.
what was that? i said
your idea sucks shit.
justin, where are you? call
me as soon as you get this.
you know that mobster, the guy
we thought was mossi's boss?
he's a cop.
and he's got all
of our evidence...
which means mossi
knows everything.
holy shit, dude!
we're dead! dead! dead!
okay, no.
everything is gonna be fine.
nothing can trace back to us.
his name is
ryan o'malley,
and he currently
lives with this guy...
justin miller.
okay, print everything out
and bring it to my office.
hold on a second.
i found the problem.
they're not even real cops.
what do you mean
they're not real cops?
<i>just what i said!</i>
we gotta take care
of this right away.
get it done!
i want the word on the street, underground!
anyone who gets them!
you're not even supposed to be
in here, let alone talking.
a bunch of
shirtless firefighters...
spraying zombies
with their hoses?
what kind of game you
trying to make, bro?
i'm gonna give you one second
to get the fuck out of here.
you like that?
this guy is crazy.
yeah, <i>ese.</i>
now, a few weeks ago...
i pitched you a game
and you didn't listen.
that really hurt my feelings.
you were there.
so were you.
now, i'm going to
pitch my game again
and you're going
to hear me out...
or i'm going to beat the shit
out of everyone in this room.
and i've fought women before.
i didn't win...
but i'm down to redeem myself.
<i>what if we made
a game so visceral...</i>
<i>that it made you feel like you
were in real life danger?</i>
to feel like it's
about to go down?
<i>don't think of it as a game.</i>
<i>think of it as
a real life experience.</i>
<i>you are a cop.</i>
<i>my game is about
getting into situations</i>
<i>you wouldn't be in
in your normal life.</i>
situations that are dangerous.
real.
where it felt like you
could actually get killed.
aah!
real violence isn't
like in the movies.
there he is!
gunfire is terrifying.
<i>bullets are sick.</i>
they blast and rip
through everything.
but isn't that what
people want, right?
to really feel what it's
like to be in the shit?
that's what i'm
talking about, people.
excuse me.
justin, there is a police officer
in the lobby to see you.
no, no. you can tell
ryan to wait, please.
justin! do not go home!
i'm coming to your work!
we are in a lot of trouble...
no, no, no.
no, no, no!
i can assure you that i will
make this thing more real...
than anything you have
ever seen in your life.
how are you gonna show us
this realistic violence, huh?
freeze!
nobody move!
you!
that's a presentation!
let's make this game!
aah!
what the fuck have
you guys been doing, huh?
dude, where
the hell are you?
<i>are you having fun?</i>
<i>justin miller.</i>
<i>you wanna be a cop? average
police response time...</i>
<i>12 minutes.</i>
<i>average time it takes for a
man to bleed out, 7 minutes.</i>
<i>you do the math.</i>
ryan.
ryan!
<i>don't come, justin!
run! run!</i>
ryan!
fuck!
officer segars.
segars, it's justin.
who?
it's chang. i'm chang.
chang? what the hell,
you piece of shit!
i'm hearing all kinds of crazy things!
<i>i know, i know.</i>
and what you heard is true.
we're not cops.
it's true?
<i>but everything i'm about to tell you right now is real.</i>
mossi has got ryan,
and he is gonna kill him.
he's got him in an underground
tunnel beneath tirana, mossi's club.
what underground tunnels
are you talking about?
<i>it's their safehouse.</i>
and there are cops involved.
they tried to shoot me.
hey, you better watch
what you're saying, chang.
just come to tirana, and
you'll see it for yourself.
<i>please!</i>
where are you right now?
how are you doing, partner?
long time no see.
mmm.
you have the vest on.
that's not gonna help.
you're gonna die today.
and so is your friend.
so the best thing you can do
is just tell me everything.
who did you give
the evidence to?
how many copies do you have?
your choice.
you go quick and painless...
or you're gonna endure
something that is...
unspeakable.
hey.
what are you doing down there?
josie, you gotta go, okay?
take georgie and lydia and
get out of here right now.
what are you talking about?
don't come...
i'm not a cop, okay?
why do you keep saying that?
it's complicated.
but what's most important
is that you leave right now.
then, if you're not a cop,
who the hell are you?
no one you want to know.
now go.
sorry to bother you gentlemen.
i need to come in...
and take a look around.
just don't hurt him.
this was my idea.
just let him be.
i'm the only one...
hey.
one of your pigs is upstairs.
i thought you had
control of your cops.
uh...
no, no, no, mossi, listen.
mossi, listen to me.
you think he's
gonna protect you?
you think a guy like that is gonna
protect you? think about this.
i've got evidence
to put him away for years.
you don't think he's gonna
cover his tracks with you?
huh? think, mossi!
what is your backup plan?
no, no.
no. no, please.
no, no, no, please.
no, no, no!
no!
shit!
that's my backup plan.
ryan! ryan!
where do these doors go?
this is gonna be so much
easier if you just hold still.
hold still!
open. open. open.
no!
i'll shoot him!
i'll shoot him!
i swear to god...
oh...
i had your 6, dude.
drop your weapons!
get down!
what are you doing?
saving your life!
but don't get on top of me like this!
i don't like this!
request all available units...
justin, get off!
what the hell was that?
help get these
off me, quick.
holy shit.
you all right?
yeah, are you okay?
yeah.
thank you for
saving us... just shut up!
we didn't mean
to screw you over.
it was never our intention
to pull you into this.
i don't care.
get upstairs and get outside!
and take that thing off.
that's a uniform.
you gotta earn it. you
understand that, "sarge?"
now get the fuck out of here.
i need backup, now.
what are you doing?
i can't do this.
he's outmanned, he's
outgunned, and it's my fault.
you were right. i gotta take
responsibility for once.
that's not what i meant.
wait!
what, man?
no more running away, right?
yeah.
what the fuck?
my bad.
let's not use these.
what are you doing?
get the hell out of here!
go! now!
here's what we gotta do. we gotta
pull the fire away from him.
he's stuck, okay?
all right.
on the count of three, we
gotta shoot like crazy, okay?
okay?
okay.
segars!
they killed segars, man!
all right, we gotta find a door.
look back here. let's go.
we gotta get
the fuck out of here.
shit, man.
what are we gonna do?
being in the shit
isn't the shit.
no, it's not the shit.
look, man,
i'm sorry about everything.
everything i said.
i didn't mean...
justin, we're brothers.
yeah. yeah.
yeah, we're brothers...
get up, get up!
are you okay?
did i just get shot? no, it's just
the spray. you're okay. we gotta go.
i just got shot!
like i haven't been shot before.
come on!
what?
let's go.
before we die,
i just want to tell you...
if you tell me you love me, i'm
gonna punch you in your face.
but we're about to die!
but you were about to say
that you loved me!
yeah.
say something better.
fuck you.
that's better.
ryan?
ryan? ryan?
shit.
chang!
oh!
fuck, chang!
are you okay?
beside the fact that you
shot me, i'm great, chang.
i'm sorry.
segars, those two with you?
yeah, we're good.
code 4.
all teams, 10-12.
<i>really too late to call so</i>
<i>we waited for</i>
<i>morning to wake you
that's all we got</i>
<i>to know me as hardly golden</i>
<i>is to know me all wrong</i>
<i>they were</i>
<i>at every occasion i'll be</i>
<i>ready for a funeral</i>
<i>at every occasion...</i>
<i>life can
get confusing...</i>
<i>and you lose sight of the
person you wanted to be.</i>
<i>the los angeles police
department is proud to announce...</i>
<i>mossi kasic is no longer
a threat to this city.</i>
<i>fortunately, i did not have
to make this arrest alone.</i>
<i>this was truly a team effort.</i>
<i>all right, man.</i>
i'm passing this
gauntlet on to you...
so don't let these streets get
all messed up again, all right?
i got this shit, bro.
<i>sometimes, you have
to go through hell and back.</i>
or, we just blow shit up!
<i>to see that the problems you
thought were so big in your life...</i>
<i>weren't so big after all.</i>
or not. we could just do
what you want to do.
right.
the 2 cops have to work together to
get out. i think it could be great.
are you writing this down?
give me that.
write that down.
<i>and that courage
you always wanted...</i>
<i>you always had it. you just
needed to get in the game.</i>
hi.
sorry, we don't
serve liars here.

bullshit for the road?
josie, i didn't come
here to win you back.
or go back to whatever
we were before.
