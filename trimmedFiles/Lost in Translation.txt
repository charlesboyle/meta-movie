they had all these ...
rock-and-roll clothes,
but the band wasn't tough at all.
the label guy just kept saying,
"more lock and loll,"
but it's just so much better ...
if they're just skinny and nerdy
like they came in, you know.
they're making them wear all these
keith richards clothes,
and it's just ridiculous.
they should let them be who they are.
don't you think? i mean ...

how stupid everybody is all the time?
i thought it was funny.
forget it.
well ...
- hey, john, we gotta go.
- oh. yeah.
bye.
did you ever wonder what
your purpose in life is?
this book is about finding
your soul's purpose or destiny.
every soul has its path, but
sometimes that path is not clear.
the inner map theory
is an example ...
of how each soul begins
with an imprint,
all compacted into a pattern that
has been selected by your soul ...
before you've even gotten here.
you know, i guess the reason why
i like japan the best ...
out of all asian countries,
is because i really feel
close to buddhism.
i really feel ...
i really believe in reincarnation.
that's part of what drew me
to midnight velocity as well,
because although keanu dies,
he eventually gets reincarnated.
so there's hope. there's hope
in reincarnation, i think.
what was it like
working with keanu reeves?
he was always so ... he was always,
you know, giving me ideas,
and, you know, really helpful.
he made me feel
really comfortable, so ...
and we both have two dogs,
and we both live in l.a.,
so we have all these
different things in common.
so, you know, we both
really like mexican food,
and yoga and ...
karate!
mexican food. yoga.
konnichiwa.
- hello.
- hi.
okay.
- okay.
- okay.
he got married
a couple of times ...
to some nice women.
beautiful women too. i mean, you and
i would be crazy for these women.
but there were always rumors.
i never liked his acting,
so i never gave a damn
whether he was straight or not.
thank you. hi. thanks.
what can i get you?
i'm not sure.
for relaxing times,
make it suntory time.
i'll have a vodka tonic.
thanks.
so, what are you doing here?
a couple of things.
taking a break from my wife,
forgetting my son's birthday ...
and getting paid $2 million ...
to endorse a whisky ...
when i could be doing
a play somewhere.
oh.
but the good news is,
the whisky works.
what are you doing?
my husband's a photographer,
so he's here working,
and i wasn't doing anything,
so i came along.
and we have some friends
that live here.
how long have you
been married?
thank you.
two years.
twenty-five long ones.
you're probably just
having a midlife crisis.
did you buy a porsche yet?
you know, i was thinking
about buying a porsche.
twenty-five years. that's a ...
well, it's impressive.
well, you figure you sleep
one-third of your life.
that knocks off eight years of
marriage right there.
so you're down to 16 and change.
you're just a teenager at marriage.
you can drive it, but there's
still the occasional accident.
yeah.
what do you do?
i'm not sure yet, actually.
i just graduated last spring.
what did you study?
philosophy.
yeah, there's a good buck
in that racket.
yeah.
well, so far it's pro bono.
well, i'm sure you'll
figure out the angles.
yeah.
i hope your porsche works out.
cheers to that, huh?
cheers to that.
wish i could sleep.

that was a stupid idea.
- i was feeling tight, you know?
- mmm-hmm.
- shoulders and neck.
- mmm-hmm.
so i called down and had a ...
shiatsu massage in my room.
that's nice.
and the tightness has
completely disappeared ...
and been replaced by ...
unbelievable pain.
just staggering, unbearable pain.
that's too bad.
- yeah.
- i'm in pain.
i got my foot banged up, and ...
wanna see it?
how do you say "no"?
- oh, my gosh!
- i know.
that's ...
how ... when did you do this?
i did it the other day.
it hurts, you know?
didn't you feel any pain? your ...
yeah, it really hurt.
it was ...
yeah. that toe is almost dead.
i think i gotta take you
to a doctor.
you can't just put that
back in the shoe.
no. i don't think so.
well, you either go to a doctor,
or you leave it here.
he's smiling.
you like that idea?
see, they love black toe
over in this country.
you got a sharp knife?
gotta be, you know,
in this country,
somebody's gotta
prefer a black toe.
"brack toe."
or we should probably hang around
until someone orders it.
hey, what's with the straight face?
hospital regulations.
get in there.
- all right. thank you.
- all right.
careful, okay? no, don't!
- no!
- hey, use the horn, fella.
let's try "mixed internal".
yeah. go.
switched to beer, huh?
go. go.
you might want to switch to sake.
stop.
hi.
- hi.
- hi.
yeah. we need a doctor.
for a hurt ... emergency room.
it's not an emergency.
i just hurt my foot.
okay, do we fill this out?
we go over there?
which number?
we're not going to another hospital,
so whatever you say is okay.
okay.
could you put that back
in the garage for us?
"in desuka"?
japan.
japan ...
after?
japan ...
ahh-ah, so. ahh-ah.
ahh, so. ahh ...
how's that song go?
is that for me?
yeah, it can be for you.
hey, bob, it's charlotte.
i'm going to meet charlie and those guys
at this place called orange around 10:00,
so i'll fax you a map
on how to get there.

~ no, no. not here. ~
~ it must be over there. ~
you know,
the first time i saw you,
you were wearing
a tuxedo at the bar.
you were very dashing.
i liked the mascara.
but the first time i saw you
was in the elevator.
really?
you don't remember?
i guess you do
kind of blend in, huh?
did i scowl at you?
no, you smiled.
i did?
yes, it was a complete accident.
a freak. i haven't seen it since.
just that one time.
like that, but bigger.
bigger. yeah, big, big ...
well, not that big.
~ my goodness. ~
~ marcello, come here. hurry up. ~
why do they switch the "r's" and
the "l's" here?
oh, for yuks.
you know, just to mix it up.
they have to amuse themselves,
'cause we're not making them laugh.
let's never come here again,
'cause it would never be as much fun.
whatever you say. you're the boss.
i'm stuck.
does it get easier?
no.
yes.
it gets easier.
oh, yeah?
look at you.
thanks.
the more you know who you are,
and what you want,
the less you let ...
things upset you.
yeah.
i just don't know
what i'm supposed to be.
you know?
i tried being a writer, but ...
i hate what i write.
and i tried taking pictures,
but they're so mediocre, you know.
every girl goes through
a photography phase.
you know, like horses?
you know?
take dumb pictures of your feet.
you'll figure that out.
i'm not worried about you.
keep writing.
but i'm so mean.
- mean's okay.
- yeah?
what about marriage?
does that get easier?
that's hard.
we used to have a lot of fun.
lydia would come with me
when i made the movies,
and we would laugh about it all.
now she doesn't want to leave
the kids, and she doesn't ...
need me to be there.
the kids miss me, but they're fine.
it gets a whole lot more complicated
when you have kids.
yeah. it's scary.
it's the most terrifying
day of your life ...
the day the first one is born.
yeah. nobody ever tells you that.
your life,
as you know it,
is gone.
never to return.
but they learn how to walk, and
they learn how to talk, and ...
and you want to be with them.
and they turn out to be the most ...
delightful people ...
you will ever meet in your life.
hmm, that's nice.
where'd you grow up?
i grew up in new york,
and i moved to los angeles
when john and i got married.
but it's so different there.
yeah, i know.
john thinks i'm so snotty.
you're not hopeless.
