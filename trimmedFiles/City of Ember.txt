<i>[ man narrating ]
on the day the world ended...</i>
<i>the fate of mankind was carried
in a small metal box.</i>
<i>- [ explosion ]
- [ footsteps ]</i>
<i>[ indistinct conversations ]</i>
<i>in a secret location, architects,
scientists and engineers met...</i>
<i>and concluded that there was
only one hope for our future:</i>
[ beeping ]
<i>to build an underground city...</i>
<i>designed to keep its citizens protected
for generations to come.</i>
[ beeping ]
secure the box.
set it for 200 years.
- [ beeping ]
- we'll keep them in the city for 200 years.
you're certain
that'll be long enough?
none of us can be certain of anything.
we can hope.
<i>growing up with no knowledge
of a world outside...</i>
future generations will be spared sorrow
for what they've lost.
- for the good of all mankind.
- [ beeps ]
<i>[ narrator ]
the box was entrusted to the first mayor...</i>
<i>who was to pass it on
to her successor.</i>
[ clicking ]
<i>as the years counted down...</i>
<i>the box passed from mayor to mayor.</i>
<i>none knew what secrets it held...</i>
<i>only that it would open
when it was needed most.</i>
<i>but fate ran another course...</i>
<i>and the chain was broken.</i>
<i>the box was tucked away
and forgotten...</i>
<i>- and as the city grew old and began to crumble...
- [ beeping ]</i>
<i>the box quietly clicked open.</i>
[ beeps ]
- dad, do you hear that?
- uh, hurry up. you don't wanna be late.
<i>- i am hurrying.
- i'm proud of you, son.</i>
- today's a big day.
- yeah.
i just hope i don't get assigned
some useless job.
<i>you can't control whatjob you get on
assignment day. that's not the point.</i>
<i>- the important thing is to do--
- [ machines powering down ]</i>
your part.
one, two, three, four...
five, six, seven, eight--
<i>[ machines powering up ]</i>
they're getting longer.
<i>- that one was.
- yeah, and it's the third one this week.</i>
the generator's
our only source of power.
<i>- [ man on p.a.] all electricians and wiremen--
- if it goes--</i>
<i>- are advised to report to their stations.
- we all go.</i>
- that's dramatic.
- dad, this place is falling apart.
no, i will not just sit around
while ember collapses.
i'm getting into that generator,
whatever it takes.

<i>-[ doon ] it says ''pipeworks. ''

this printing--
you know what it reminds me of?
come on.
i gotta show you something.
[ lina whispering ]
what are we doing here?
[ doon ] the builders left us this book.
we learned about it in history.
[ mechanical whirring ]
go on. open it up.
n-no one but the mayor's supposed to.
[ lina ]
the builders wrote these instructions.
it's exactly the same.
<i>[ keys rattling in lock ]</i>
<i>- [ yawns ]

[ whispering ]
come on.
there's something i have to show you.
- wow.

- yeah?
what i don't understand is,
why would they have it in a circle?
<i>- i mean, i know it must be important.
- add a ''t.''</i>
<i>- what?
- add a ''t.''</i>
e-x-i-t. exit.
what if there's an exit from ember?
[ lina ] i don't think
we're supposed to be down here.
<i>[ doon ]
this tunnel was erased from sul's map.</i>

this could be it.
<i>[ loud crack ]</i>
<i>- [ man ] that was just the last time.

[ panting ]
thanks for another great idea.
moles need to eat all the time
just to stay alive.
probably just as hungry as we are.
did you see those storerooms?
they're completely empty.
we're gonna run out of food.
it doesn't matter anyway.
the generator won't last.
<i>and pretty soon
it'll be black for good.</i>
<i>''mayfleet.'' that's my name.</i>
the man who wore that helmet
before me drowned.
drowned?
[ lina sobbing ]
he worked here.
there's no water
but the irrigation pipes.
how could he have drowned?
<i>i miss him so much.</i>
mom too.
how am i ever gonna figure out
what this is all about?
it's all these zeros.
that's what scares me the most.
what would count down to nothing?
- it sounds like doomsday.
- oh, shh.
please, honey.
don't do anything foolish.
i couldn't bear to lose you too.
how did he die, clary?
oh.
did he really drown?
[ hinges creaking ]
your father thought
it was doomsday too.
<i>he believed there was a way
to get out of ember.</i>
<i>i couldn't dissuade him.</i>
<i>i said it was our duty to stay here
and fix our problems...</i>
that it's illegal to venture out
into the unknown.
why is it illegal?
<i>your father said,
''the river runs in one direction...</i>
<i>so it must come from someplace
and go to someplace. ''</i>
<i>but he must've hit it too early or something.
i-i don't know.</i>
<i>the tunnel flooded, and--</i>
<i>and my dad died.</i>
he was by himself?
everyone else got out
before it collapsed.
i was-- i was considering
taking the box to the mayor.
<i>yes.! do that.</i>
do that instead, please.
let him handle the situation.
<i>[ applause ]</i>
<i>these are trying and troubled times.</i>
our problems are grave.
we need answers.
<i>but beyond answers--</i>
more important than answers--
we need solutions.
- mm-hmm.
- yeah.
<i>- dd[ one note ]
- and in order to find those solutions...</i>
i propose we launch
a thorough investigation.
[ crowd ]
yes. yes.
i hereby declare
the creation of a task force...
to investigate the blackouts.
<i>[ crowd applauding ]</i>
<i>do i have volunteers?</i>
today we, the people...
stand united against the darkness.
[ crowd cheering, shouting ]
<i>[ approaching footsteps ]</i>
- [ children chattering ]

<i>what's ''applesauce''?</i>
<i>[ girl ]
hey, give me some.!</i>

no one's had pineapple since my grandmother
was a little girl. where'd you get this?
give me that!
lizzie! where'd you get that food?
[ gags ]
all right.
i got it from my boyfriend.
you don't have a boyfriend.
it's not official, but there's this guy
who really likes me.
he explores the storerooms,
especially the ones on the edges.
they're marked empty in the ledger,
but they're not all empty.
i'll give you a bite
if you promise not to tell.
- it's wrong, lizzie.
- well, he says it's all gonna be gone soon anyway.
why not live as well
as we can right now?
there he is.
<i>[ shoes squeaking ]</i>
- doon!
- [ snoring ]
<i>- have you--
- [ beeping ]</i>
<i>doon.!</i>
i need to tell you something.
<i>it was looper we saw
near that 35 1 door.</i>
before that, i took a message
to the mayor for him.
[ loud hissing ]
<i>i'll bet there's something big
on the other side of that door.</i>
[ rattles, clicks ]
[ quiet gasp ]
<i>[ glasses clinking ]</i>
<i>[ lina ]
there's so much food.</i>
<i>[ lina gasping ]</i>
[ stomach gurgling ]
[ snorting ]
[ whispers ]
go.
and i thought he was lying
when he talked about finding a solution.
he wasn't lying.
he's found his solution.
poppy. lie down, okay?
it's time to go to sleep.
could you just pump those pedals?
what is this?
it's the answering machine tape
from my parents' phone.
- when we still had one.
- [ beeps ]
[ raine's voice ]
yoo-hoo. yoo-hoo!
anybody home?
<i>[ sighs ]
don't hold dinner for me, darling.</i>
<i>- that's my dad's voice.
- i'll be there before lights out.</i>
[ beeps ]
raine, it's me, barrow.
i've been thinkin' about it.
i watch my boy,
and... i've come around.
i've changed my mind. i'm in.
what's wrong?
[ exhales ]
he lied to me.
where are you going?
well, meet me
at the greenhouses, okay?
<i>good night,young man.</i>
<i>- [ water dripping ]
- how was your rehearsal?</i>
for the singing.
oh. i-it was fine.
- it was really good.
- good.
<i>- good night.
- good night.</i>
dad. i heard you.
<i>i heard you on the answering--</i>
lina mayfleet has her parents'
old answering machine tape.
i heard you.
you said her dad could count you in.
<i>[ whirring, clattering ]</i>
you tried to leave the city, didn't you?
w-why would i do that?
because of me.
dad.
<i>please.</i>
- we were wrong.
- no, you were right.
there is an exit.
yeah. raine thought so, too,
and it got him killed, son.
dad, there's a way out
in the pipeworks...
but you have to tell me
everything that you know.
- tell me what you know.
- i don't know anything, and neither do you.
<i>the builders left instructions.</i>
the builders abandoned us.
no, they didn't.
they didn't, dad. i have proof.
show me.
<i>[ chattering ]</i>
wait!
oh. happy great day of singing,
young lady.
i need to speak to you in private.
very well then.
what i need to tell you is secret
and really important.
- what is it?
- the mayor-- he's got a bunker in the pipeworks.
it's filled with food.
the shortages aren't as bad
as everyone thinks.
you mean the mayor is stealing?
looper, who works in the storerooms,
is helping him.
well, this is shocking.
shocking. i'm shocked.
um, we have to report this.
come with me.
- well done, lina mayfleet.
- once you arrest him, doon and i
can show you where the room is--
<i>wait. where are we going?</i>
- [ grunting ]
- [ gasping ]
<i>[ smacking lips ]</i>
i beg your pardon, your honor.
<i>you remember lina mayfleet?</i>
she wants to accuse you.
accuse me of what?
of stealing food
from the people of ember.
i love my city and everyone in it.
and i would never think
to do such a thing.
we saw your room!
we saw you in it!
<i>- ''we''?
- she and her friend, doon harrow.</i>
what's that box?
<i>hmm.</i>
it's mine.
it's unusual looking.
where'd you get that?
<i>[ passing footsteps ]</i>
you're related to one of the mayors.
yes. uh, he was the seventh mayor.
a lot of things got lost
when the seventh mayor passed.
may i look at that box, lina?
- why?
- what's inside the box, lina?
i imagine it's official
mayor-related business.
<i>box. give it to me.</i>
- it's not yours.
- give me the box!
- no!
- get it from her. now.
<i>take it from her.! move.!</i>
<i>grab her.!
[ shouts ]</i>
<i>- have you got her?
- [ man shouts ]</i>
get her.
<i>[ whistle blowing ]</i>
stop! after her!
<i>[ whistle blowing continues ]</i>
is this the home of doon harrow?
is he here?
i-i-i can't hear. i have a weak ear.
y-you have to talk louder.
- doon harrow!
- doon harro-- no, loris.
we're looking for doon harrow.
he's charged with treason against the city.
that's terrible.
if it's true, he's no son of mine!
<i>treason is the worst offense
anyone could possibly commit.</i>
<i>builders were wise when they said,
''if you have proof, you have to pursue it!</i>
<i>there's more to a bottle cap than
keeping liquid from leaking out of glass.!''</i>
- get him!
- uh, we'll go this way.
doon! the guards are here!
you traitor!
- in here. follow him.
- they're comin' to get you!
the keypad is somewhere.
- [ imitating keypad beeping ]
- what's he doin'?
<i>-just one second.
- [ man ] he's crazy.</i>
<i>- is this the way to your apartment?
- apparently not. [ screams ]</i>
<i>[ man ]
upstairs.!</i>
[ high-pitched screeching ]
- they're after me!
- who?
- guards!
- why?
<i>- doon and i, we-- quick.
- [ whistle blowing ]</i>
<i>what is this all about?
we'll be late for the great day of singing.</i>
well, excuse me, ma'am.
i'm-- i'm looking for lina mayfleet.
well, she's not here. she's probably
already in harken square.
- okay, okay. well, i guess
i'll just have a look for myself.
- oh! excuse me.
beg your pardon! so sorry.
<i>you know, the mayor did
ask for her specifically.</i>
the greenhouse. uh, she was meeting
a friend at the greenhouse.
<i>does that help?</i>
<i>[ paper rips ]</i>
<i>[ whistle blows ]</i>
careful!
that's food you're destroying!
our food!
<i>psst.!</i>
<i>[ whistles ]</i>
<i>[ footsteps approaching ]</i>
a warning:
if i discover you were helping, harboring
or otherwise assisting those kids--
why would i do that?
i have information
they were coming this way.
who provided you
with that information?
that's confidential.
all i need for you to understand is this:
if you're involved, you'll regret it.
<i>- [ man shouting ]
- anything you hear, anything you see...</i>
you tell me.
otherwise,
there will be consequences.
should anything happen in the future
that you hear of or see...
<i>i'll expect to be informed.</i>
<i>- i don't need to tell you
that i have the mayor's ear.
- [ door creaking ]</i>
<i>hmm.</i>
[ wood creaking ]
[ quiet gasp ]
okay.
[ chuckling ]
leave two guards behind!
we've gotta find a way out of here.
now.
what is this?
my dad made this.
it doesn't look very safe.
that's my dad.
everything he makes looks like this.
what do you mean, your dad?
barrow. his voice is on
your answering machine.
but your dad's name is loris.
barrow harrow. it's his nickname.
- after some wheelbarrow he used to push around.
- you're the boy!
that means our parents
were trying to escape together.
they were trying.
we're running out of time.
they'll come back for us.
[ metal screeching ]
[ motor whirring ]
pedal!
now, you stay here and be a good girl.
okay? and look for me up there.
- where's lina?
- oh, i'm-- she's here somewhere.
- can you see anything?
- barely.
<i>[ crowd chattering ]</i>
[ cheering ]

the moment in the year...
when we pause to celebrate
our fair city.
this beacon of light...
in a world of darkness.

[ snoring ]
<i>- [ hammering ]
- wait.</i>
something's not right.
the builders were smart.
they would have made it simple.
[ grunts ]
i wouldn't call any of this simple.
they would have thought it through.
they planned...
everything.
doon.
there's something behind those lockers.
poppy, come on. let's go. quick.
there's gotta be a way in.
what... are these for?
<i>''bo-at.''</i>

[ grunts ]
poppy!

<i>the water level is too low.!

would have wanted.
- okay. come on.
- okay. um--
<i>''access''--

tell them somehow.
we need to tell them what's up here.
<i>[ loris narrating ] lina and doon
tied their hope to a rock...</i>
<i>and tossed it down toward the city.</i>
<i>the rock could've ended up on a roof.</i>
<i>or kicked into a gutter.</i>
<i>but fate ran another course.</i>
<i>and the message found its way.</i>
<i>now the path was clear for all.</i>
<i>all of us who kept
the flame of ember burning...</i>
<i>through the darkness...</i>
<i>so that we could live again
on the earth...</i>
<i>in the air and the light.</i>
