this is a true story
the events depicted in this film
took place in minnesota in 1987.
at the request of the survivors,
the names have been changed.
out of respect for the dead,
the rest has been told exactly
as it occurred.
i'm jerry lundegaard.
- you're jerry lundegaard?
- yah.
shep said...
shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
what gives, man?
shep said 8:30.
we've been sitting here an hour.
he's peed three times already.
i'm sure sorry. shep told me 8:30.
it was a mix-up, i guess.
- you got the car?
- yah, you bet.
it's out in the lot there,
brand-new ciera.
yeah, okay. well, sit down, then.
i'm carl showalter.
this is my associate, gaear grimsrud.
yah, how ya doing?
so we all set on this thing, then?
- sure, we're set. why wouldn't we be?
- yah, i'm sure you are.
shep vouched for you.
i got every confidence in you fellas.
i guess that's it, then.
- here are the keys.
- no, that's not it.
- huh?
- the new vehicle plus $40,000.
yah, but the deal was...
...the car first, then the $40,000,
like as if it was the ransom.
- i thought shep told you.
- shep didn't tell us much.
- well, okay...
- except that you'd be here at 7:30.
- well, that was a mix-up.
- yeah, you already said that.
yah, but it's not
a whole pay-in-advance deal.
see, i give you
a brand-new vehicle in advance...
i'm not gonna debate you.
okay.
i'm not gonna sit here and debate.
i'll say this though, what shep
told us didn't make much sense.
oh, no, it's real sound.
it's all worked out.
you want your own wife kidnapped?
my point is, you pay the ransom,
what, 80,000 bucks?
i mean, you give us half the ransom,
$40,000. you keep half.
it's like robbing peter to pay paul.
makes no sense.
okay. see, it's not me
paying the ransom.
the thing is, my wife, she's wealthy.
her dad, he's real well-off.
i'm in a bit of trouble.
what kind of trouble are you in?
that's... i'm not gonna get into...
see, i just need the money.
now, her dad, he's real well-off.
why not ask him for the money?
- or your fucking wife.
- or your wife, jerry.
well...
...it's all part of this...
they don't know i need it, see.
so there. and even if they did,
i wouldn't get it.
so there's that on top.
see, these are personal matters.
personal matters?
personal matters that needn't...
okay, jerry. you're tasking us
to perform this mission...
...but you won't... you won't...
fuck it, let's take a look
at that ciera.
- hon?
- hi, hon. welcome back.
- how was fargo?
- real good.
dad's here.
- how're ya doing, wade?
- yah, pretty good.
- what ya watching there?
- gophers.
who they playing?
- is he staying for supper, then?
- yah, i think so.
- dad?
- what?
- are you staying for supper?
- yeah.
- may i be excused?
- you done there?
- i'm going out.
- where are you going?
- just mcdonald's.
- back at 9:30.
he just ate. he's going to
mcdonald's instead of finishing here.
he sees his friends there. it's okay.
it's okay, mcdonald's?
what do you think they do there?
they don't drink shakes.
it's okay, dad.
wade, have you had a chance
to think about...
...that deal i talked about?
those 40 acres on wayzata.
you told me about it.
you said you'd think about it.
i know it's a lot of money.
it's a heck of a lot.
what'd you say you'll put there?
- a lot. it's a limited...
- i know it's a lot.
i mean, a parking lot.
- well, $750,000 is a lot.
- yah, it's a chunk, but...
i had a couple of lots, late '50s,
lost a lot of money.
i thought you were gonna
show to stan grossman.
he passes on this stuff before
it gets to me.
stan'll say no dice.
that's why you pay him.
i'm asking you. this could work out
real good for me, jean and scotty.
jean and scotty never have to worry.
where is pancakes house?
- what?
- we stop at pancakes house.
are you nuts?
we had pancakes for breakfast.
gotta go to a place where i can get
a shot, a beer, steak maybe...
...not more fucking pancakes.
come on.
oh, come on, man!
okay, here's an idea.
we can stop at brainerd.
i know a place there we can get laid.
- i'm fucking hungry now, you know.
- yeah, jesus.
i'm saying, we can stop, get pancakes,
and then we'll get laid.
we sat right here in this room
and went over this.
yah, but that trucoat...
i sat here and said
i didn't want any trucoat.
yah, but that trucoat, you don't
get it, you get oxidation problems.
it'll cost you more than $500.
you're sitting there, talking in
circles, like we didn't go over this.
but this trucoat...
we had a deal for $19,500.
you sat there...
...and said you'd get me this car
without the sealant for $19,500.
i'm not saying i didn't.
you called me and said you had it
ready for delivery, come and get it.
and here you are, wasting my time
and my wife's time.
i'm paying $19,500
for this vehicle.
all right, i'll talk to my boss.
see, they install that trucoat at the
factory. there's nothing we can do.
i'll talk to my boss.
these guys here, these guys.
it's always the same.
it's always more.
- you going to the gophers on sunday?
- you betcha.
wouldn't have an extra ticket?
you kidding?
he never done this before, but seeing
as it's special circumstances...
...he says i can knock $100
off that trucoat.
one hundred?
you lied to me, mr. lundegaard.
- you're a bald-faced liar.
- bucky, please.
- fucking liar.
- bucky, please.
where's my goddamn checkbook?
let's get this over with.
<i>from hollywood:</i>
the tonight show.
i'm talking about your potential.
you're not a c student.
yet you're getting c grades.
it's that disparity there
that concerns your dad and me.
you know what a disparity is?
okay, well, that's why we don't
want you going out for hockey.
oh, man! come on,
what's the big deal?
- it's just an hour.
- hold on.
- what's the big deal?
- hello?
<i>- yeah, hi, hon.</i>
- oh, hi, dad.
<i>- jerry around?</i>
- yah. hon? i'll catch him for you.
- hon! it's dad.
- yah, okay.
dad, there's no fucking way...
- scotty!
- hey, let's watch that language, there!
- how ya doing?
<i>- what's going on?</i>
nothing, wade. how ya doing there?
<i>stan grossman looked at your</i>
<i>proposal. he says it's sweet.</i>
- no kidding?
<i>- might be interested.</i>
no kidding? i need the cash pretty
quick in order to close the deal.
<i>come by at 2:30, we'll talk about it.</i>
<i>if your numbers are right,</i>
<i>stan says it's sweet.</i>
<i>- stan, you know, grossman.</i>
- yah.
<i>- 2:30.</i>
- yah, okay.
say, shep, how ya doing there?
say, you know those two fellas
you put me in touch with in fargo?
put you in touch with grimsrud.
yah, well, he had a buddy there.
i don't vouch for him.
i vouch for grimsrud.
who's his buddy?
carl something.
never heard of him.
that's okay. he's a buddy of the guy
ya vouched for, i'm not worried.
i was wondering, see,
i gotta get in touch with them.
see, this deal i needed them for...
...i may not need it anymore.
something's happening.
- call him up.
- see, i did that...
...and i haven't been able
to get him...
...so i thought maybe you'd know
an alternate number.
- nope.
- okay. well...
real good, then.
can you crack a window open, man?
you know, it's proven that
secondhand smoke is a carcin...
a cancer agent.
look at that, twin cities.
that's the ids building.
tallest skyscraper in the midwest.
after the sears in chicago
or john hancock building, whatever.
ever been to minneapolis?
nope.
would it kill you to say something?
i did.
"no." that's the first thing
you've said in four hours.
that's a fountain
of conversation, man.
that's a geyser.
i mean, whoa, daddy, stand back, man.
shit. i'm sitting here driving,
doing all the driving, man...
...whole way from brainerd, driving.
just trying to...
...chat, keep our spirits up,
fight the boredom of the road...
...and you can't say one
thing in the way of conversation?
fuck it, i don't have to talk
either, man. see how you like it.
just total fucking silence.
two can play at that game, smart guy.
we'll just see how you like it.
total silence.
<i>mr. lundegaard? this is reilly</i>
<i>diefenbach from gmac.</i>
<i>- how are you?</i>
- good, how ya doing?
<i>good, mr. lundegaard.</i>
<i>you're hard to get on the phone.</i>
it's darn busy here,
but that's the way we like it.
<i>well, that's for sure.</i>
<i>i just need, on these last</i>
<i>financing documents you sent us...</i>
<i>... i can't read the serial numbers.</i>
yah, but i already got the...
the loans are in place. i got...
<i>the $320,000. you got</i>
<i>the money last month.</i>
yah, so we're all set.
<i>but the vehicles you're borrowing on,</i>
<i>i can't read the serial numbers...</i>
<i>... on your application.</i>
<i>if you could...</i>
but the deal's done. i got the money.
<i>but we have an audit. i have to know</i>
<i>these vehicles you're financing...</i>
<i>... that they really exist.</i>
they exist all right.
<i>i'm sure, but i can't read the</i>
<i>serial numbers. if you could read...</i>
yah, but...
see, i don't have them in front of me.
why don't i fax you a copy?
<i>no, fax is no good. that's what</i>
<i>i have, and i can't read it.</i>
yah, okay, i'll have my girl
send you a copy, then.
<i>if i can't correlate this note with the</i>
<i>vehicles, i gotta call back that money.</i>
how much money was that?
<i>$320,000. i've gotta correlate that</i>
<i>money with the cars it's lent on.</i>
- no problem, i'll fax that over.
<i>- no! fax is...</i>
i mean, send it over.
i'll shoot it over.
<i>- okay, fine.</i>
- okay, real good, then.
<i>we're back with katie carlson.</i>
<i>we want to remind our viewers...</i>
<i>... that this march,</i>
<i>for the second year...</i>
<i>... katie and i,</i>
<i>along with twin city travel...</i>
<i>... will lead a two-week</i>
<i>boat trip down the nile.</i>
<i>it's a terrific time, as you heard,</i>
<i>and we want all of you to come with.</i>
<i>and that's the truth.</i>
<i>for those of you</i>
<i>who just joined us...</i>
<i>... katie is going to show us how to</i>
<i>make holidazzle eggs at home.</i>
<i>i got to admit, i was a little bit</i>
<i>surprised when i picked this up.</i>
<i>- this is an empty egg.</i>
<i>- that's right, dale.</i>
<i>how do you get the egg in here..?</i>
<i>how do you, i mean, you</i>
<i>don't have an empty chicken...</i>
<i>... somewhere that lays empty eggs?</i>
<i>no, i guarantee this was</i>
<i>an honest-to-goodness grade...</i>
- unguent.
- what?
i need unguent.
- how are ya, stan?
- how ya doing, wade?
good to see you again, jerry.
if these numbers are right,
this looks sweet.
those numbers are right,
believe me.
- this is doable.
- congratulations, jer.
yah, thanks stan. it's a pretty...
what kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?
the financials are thorough, so...
...the thing we don't know
is your fee.
my fee? wade, what the heck
are you talking about?
- stan and i are okay.
- yah?
- we're good to load in.
- yah.
but we never talked about your fee
for bringing it to us.
no, i was bringing you this deal
to loan me the money to put in.
it's my deal here, see.
- we thought you brought us a deal.
- yah, right.
you're saying...
what are you saying?
you're saying, we put in the money,
you collect when it pays off.
no, no! i'd pay you back
the principal and interest.
- heck, i'd go one over prime?
- we're not a bank, jerry.
if i wanted a bank interest
on $750,000...
...i'd go to midwest federal,
talk to bill diehl.
- he's at norstar.
- he's at...
no, no, but see,
i don't need a finder's fee.
i need...
finder's fee's what, 10 percent?
that's not gonna do it for me.
i need the principal.
jerry, we're not gonna
just give you $750,000.
what the heck were you thinking?
if i'm only getting bank interest,
i want security.
heck, fdic.
i don't see nothing like that here.
yeah, but i...
okay, i guarantee you
your money back.
i'm not talking about
your damn word, jerry.
- what the heck..?
- we're not a bank.
i don't want to cut you
out of the loop...
...this here's a good deal.
i assume, if you're not interested,
you won't mind if we move on it.
independently.
damn it!
hon?
got the groceries.
yah, wade...
...it's jerry. i...
wade, it's jerry.
i don't know what to do. it's jean.
i don't know what to do.
it's my wife.
i don't know what to do. it's jean.
yah, wade, i...
it's jerry, i...
wade, it's jerry. we gotta talk.
it's something hor...
jeez, it's terrible.
yah, wade gustafson, please.
shut the fuck up, or i'll throw you
back into the trunk, you know.
that's more than i've heard
you say all week.
ah, shit!
oh, the tags.
all right, it's just the tags.
i never put my tags on the car.
don't worry, i'll take care of this.
keep it still back there, lady...
...or else we're gonna
have to, you know, shoot you.
hey, i'll take care of this.
how can i help you, officer?
this a new car, then, sir?
it certainly is, officer.
still got that smell.
you're required to display tags,
either in the plate area...
...or taped to the back window.
- certainly.
- can i see your registration?
- certainly.
yeah, i was gonna tape up the tag.
you know, to be in full compliance...
...but it must have slipped my mind.
maybe the best thing would be
to take care of it here.
what's this, sir?
my license and registration.
i want to be in compliance.
i was thinking, we could take care
of it right here in brainerd.
put that back in your pocket, please.
and step out of the car, please, sir.
shut the fuck up!
whoa.
whoa, daddy.
you'll take care of it.
you are smooth-smooth, you know.
oh, daddy.
just clear him off the road.
yeah.
oh, jeez.
hi, it's marge.
oh, my. where?
yeah.
oh, jeez.
okay, there in a jiff.
real good, then.
oh, heck.
you can sleep. it's early yet.
- gotta go?
- yeah.
i'll fix you some eggs.
it's okay, hon. i gotta run.
you gotta eat a breakfast, marge.
i'll fix you some eggs.
hon, you can sleep.
you gotta eat a breakfast.
i'll fix you some eggs.
ah, norm.
thanks, hon. time to shove off.
- love ya, margie.
- love ya, hon.
- hon?
- yah?
prowler needs a jump.
hi, lou.
what you got there?
margie. thought you might
need a little warm-up.
thanks a bunch.
what's the deal, now?
gary says triple homicide?
yah, looks pretty bad.
two of them are over here.
where is everybody?
well, it's cold, margie.
watch your step, margie.
ah, jeez.
ah, jeez!
here's the second one.
it's in the head and the hand there.
- i guess that's a defensive wound.
- oh, yah?
where's the state trooper?
back there a good piece.
in the ditch next to his prowler.
okay. so we got a trooper pulls
someone over...
...we got a shooting,
these folks drive by...
...there's a high-speed pursuit,
ends here...
...and then this execution-type deal.
- yah.
i'd be very surprised if our
suspect was from brainerd.
yah.
and i'll tell you what, from his
footprint, he looks like a big fella.
you see something down there, chief?
no, i just think i'm gonna barf!
jeez.
- you okay, margie?
- yah, i'm fine.
it's just morning sickness.
well, that passed.
- yah?
- yah, now i'm hungry again.
you had breakfast yet, margie?
- oh, yah. norm made some eggs.
- yah?
well...
...what now, do you think?
- let's go take a look at that trooper.
there's different
footprints here, lou.
- yah?
- this guy's smaller than his buddy.
oh, yah?
for pete's sake.
how's it look, marge?
well, he's got his gun on
his hip there...
...and he looks like a nice
enough guy.
- it's a real shame.
- yah.
- did you monkey with his car, there?
- no way.
somebody shut his lights.
i guess the little guy waited
for his buddy.
it would've been cold out here.
heck, yah.
you think is dave open yet?
dave?
you don't think he's mixed up in..?
oh, no, no. i just want to
get norm some night crawlers.
did you look in his citation book?
yah, last vehicle he wrote in was
a tan ciera at 2:18 a.m.
under plate number, he put dlr.
i figure they stopped him or shot him
before he filled out the tag number.
so i got the state looking for
a ciera with a tag starting dlr.
they don't got no match yet.
i'm not sure that i agree with you
- yah?
- yah.
i think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.
dlr?
jeez.
say, lou...
...hear the one about the guy who
couldn't afford personalized plates...
...so he went and changed his name
to j3l 2404?
yah, that's a good one.
<i>look, all i know is, you got</i>
<i>a problem, you call a professional.</i>
no. they said, "no cops."
they were darn clear on that, wade.
they said, "call your cops,
and we'll shoo..."
of course they'll say that.
protection? they've got jean.
i give them a million dollars, where's
my guarantee they'll let her go?
a million dollars is a lot
of damn money.
- they got my daughter.
- think this through, wade.
you give them what they want,
why won't they let her go?
you got to listen to me
on this one, wade.
heck, you don't know.
you're just whistling dixie here.
i'm saying, the cops, they can
advise us on this.
- i'm saying, call a professional.
- no. no cops.
that's final.
this is my deal here, wade.
jean is my wife, here.
i gotta tell you, wade,
i'm leaning to jerry's viewpoint here.
we gotta protect jean.
we're not holding any cards. they
got them all, so they call the shots.
- you're darn tootin'.
- damn it.
i'm telling ya.
well, why don't we?
i'm thinking we should
offer them half a million.
now, come on, here!
no way, wade. no way.
- we're not horse-trading here, wade.
- yah.
- we gotta bite the bullet on this.
- yah.
so, what's the next step here, jerry?
they'll call with instructions for a
drop. i'm to have the money tomorrow.
damn it!
- how was everything today?
- yah, real good, now.
how you doing?
okay, now, we'll get the money.
don't worry about it, jerry.
do you want anyone at home
with you till they call?
no, they don't want...
they're supposed to deal with me.
they're real clear.
they said no one listening in.
they'll be watching, you know?
maybe it's all bull, but like you
said, they're calling the shots.
okay.
now, is scotty gonna be all right?
yah, jeez. scotty. yah.
i'll go talk to him.
how you doing there, scotty?
dad, what are they doing?
what are they doing with mom?
it's okay, scotty.
they're not gonna hurt her any.
these men, they just want money.
well, what if something
goes wrong, dad?
no, nothing's going wrong here.
granddad and i, we're making
sure this gets handled right.
i really think we should
call the cops.
no, no. no one can know
about this thing.
we gotta play ball with these guys.
ask stan, he'll tell you the same.
- yeah, but, dad...
- we'll get mom back for you...
...but we gotta play ball.
that's the deal here.
so if lorraine calls, or sylvia,
you just say...
...mom's down in florida
with pearl and marty.
that's the best we can do here.
- lunchtime.
- these are for you, marge.
- janie, two of those skin-so-softs.
- sure thing.
- hi, hon.
- i brought you some lunch, margie.
- what are those, night crawlers?
- yah.
- thanks, hon.
- you bet. thanks for lunch.
oh, yah. looks pretty good.
what have we got here?
arby's?
how's the painting going?
pretty good.
found out the hautmans
are entering a painting.
- hon, you're better than them.
- they're real good.
they're good, but you're better.
you think so?
you got arby's all over me.
- norm, how's the painting going?
- not too bad, you know.
how we doing on that vehicle?
no motels registered any tan
ciera last night...
...but the night before,
two men checked into the blue ox...
...registering a ciera and leaving
the tag space blank.
- jeez, that's a good lead.
- yah.
blue ox, that truckers'
joint out there on l-35?
yah. owner was on the desk then.
said these two had company.
- oh, yah?
- yah.
<i>yeah, we both did.</i>
<i>she went to college too.</i>
i went to normandale.
- yah, that's where we met.
- i dropped out.
- yah, she dropped.
- yah.
where are you girls from?
- chaska.
- le sueur.
but i went to high school in
white bear lake. go bears.
okay, i want you to tell
me what these fellas look like.
the little guy looks funny.
- in what way?
- i don't know, just funny-looking.
can you be any more specific?
i couldn't really say.
he wasn't circumcised.
- was he funny-looking apart from that?
- yah.
so you were having sex
with the little fella, then?
- anything else you can say about him?
- no.
like i say, he was funny-looking.
more than most people.
the other fella?
he was a little older.
he looked like the marlboro man.
- oh, yah?
- yah.
but maybe i'm saying that because
he smoked a lot of marlboros.
like a subconscious
type of thing.
oh, yah. that can happen.
they said they were going
to the twin cities.
- oh, yah?
- yah.
- yah, is that useful to ya?
- you betcha, yah.
yah!
<i>come on! goddamn it!</i>
jesus christ!
come on, you fucking shit-box!
been here for days.
goddamn it, nothing to do.
fucking tv doesn't even...
damn it! come on, plug me in, man.
give me a fucking signal.
goddamn it!
come on!
fuck! come on!
plug me into the ozone, baby, come on!
fuck! fuck!
<i>the bark beetle carries the worm</i>
<i>to its nest...</i>
<i>... where it will feed its young</i>
<i>for up to six months.</i>
<i>in the spring, the larvae hatch,</i>
<i>and the cycle begins again.</i>

...i'm turning in, norm.
oh, yah?
<i>here it is, throwing off</i>

<i>oh, jeez, it's a quarter to 11.</i>
<i>i hope i didn't wake you.</i>
no. that's okay.
<i>i'm down in the twin cities...</i>
<i>... and i was watching on tv about</i>
<i>these shootings up in brainerd...</i>
<i>...and i saw you on the news.</i>
- yah.
<i>i thought, "is that margie olmstead?</i>
<i>i can't believe it!"</i>
yah, that's me.
<i>- well, how the heck are ya?</i>
- okay, you know, okay.
<i>- yah?</i>
- yah.
- how are you doing?
<i>- oh, pretty good.</i>
well, heck, it's been such
a long time, mike.
it's great to hear from ya.
yah, you got your...

this has your independent...
your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering...
...anti-lock brakes, alarm, radar.

it's my money. i'll deliver it.
what do they care?
wade's got a point.
i'll handle the call, jerry.
no, no. see, they only deal with me.
you feel this nervousness on
the phone, there. they're very...
these guys are dangerous.
all the more reason.
i don't want you...
with all due respect,
i don't want you mucking this up.
what do you mean?
if they want my money, deal with me,
or i'll go to a professional.
- there's a million dollars here.
- no...
look, jerry, you're not
selling me a damn car!
it's my show here. that's that.
it's the way we'd prefer
to handle it, jerry.
- hi. how ya doing?
- real good. how are you today?
i'm doing really super, there. thanks.
i'm mrs. gunderson.
i have a reservation.
yep, ya sure do, mrs. gunderson.

detective sibert? yah, this is marge
gunderson from brainerd. we spoke?
yah, well, actually i'm
in town here.

so...
well, i'm sorry, sir.
we still gotta charge you $4.
i just pulled in here.
i just fucking pulled in here.
well, but see, there's
a minimum charge of $4.

i guess you think you're like
an authority figure?
with that stupid fucking uniform,
huh, buddy?
king clip-on tie.
big fucking man, huh?
these are the limits of your life.
ruler of your little fucking gate.
here's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.
- where's shep?

wednesday night?
nope.
you do reside there
at 1425 freemont terrace?
yep.
- anyone else residing there?
- no.
well, mr. proudfoot, this call
came in past 3 in the morning.
it's hard to believe you don't
remember anyone calling.
i know you've had some problems...
...struggling with the narcotics,
some other entanglements...
...currently on parole.
- so?
- well, associating with criminals...
...if you're the one they talked to,
that is a violation of your parole.
it would end you up
back in stillwater.
you've got some priors, but nothing
in the nature of a homicide.
you don't want to be an accessory
to something like that.
so you think you remember
who those folks were who called ya?
- mr. lundegaard?
- huh? yeah.
could i take a minute here?
what..? what is it all about?
mind if i sit? i'm carrying
quite a load here.
- you're the owner, mr. lundegaard?
- no, executive sales manager.
- you can help me. i'm marge gun...
- my father-in-law's the owner.
i'm a police officer from up brainerd,
investigating some malfeasance.
have you had any vehicles stolen off
the lot in the past couple weeks?
specifically, a tan-colored ciera?
mr. lundegaard?
brainerd?
yah, yah. home of paul bunyan,
babe the blue ox.
babe the blue ox.
yah, you know, we got that big statue.
so you haven't had
any vehicles go missing, then?
no, no, ma'am.
okey-dokey, thanks a bunch.
i'll let you get back to work.
<i>- service.</i>
- give me shep.
<i>- he's not here.</i>

norm son-of-a-gunderson?
- yah, a long time ago.

i didn't mean to...
no, no. that's fine.
sorry, sorry.
so i was married to linda cooksey.
remember, she was a year behind us?
yeah, i think i remember her.
oh, yah.
so it didn't work out?
i've been working for honeywell
for a few years.
they're a good outfit.
yah, if you're an engineer,
you could do a lot worse.
but it's nothing like
your achievement.
it sounds like you're doing super.
it's not that... it's not that
things didn't work out...
linda had leukemia, you know.
she passed away.
no.
- it was tough.
- here you go.
it was long.
she fought real hard, marge.
well, what can you say?
- better times, huh?

and then i saw you on the tv,
and i remembered, you know.
i always liked you.
- i always liked you...

i'm sorry, you know...
i shouldn't have done this.
i shouldn't have done this.

- it's okay, mike.
you were such a super lady!
i've been so lonely.
it's okay, mike.
here's a song i dedicate to all
the ladies out here tonight.

i'm going to bed now.
- how ya doing?
- mr. mohra?
- yah.
- officer olson.
yah, right-o.
so i'm tending bar last tuesday,
and this little guy's drinking...
...and he says,
"where's the action?
i'm going crazy at the lake."
i say, "what kind of action?"
he says, "women. what do i look like?"
and i said, "i don't arrange
that kind of thing."
and he says, "but i'm going crazy."
- and i said, "this ain't the place."
- uh-huh.
he says, "i get it. you think
i'm a jerk for asking."
only he don't use the word "jerk."
so he calls me a jerk...
...and says the last guy who
thought he was a jerk is dead now.
he says, "what do you think?"
i said, "that don't sound
too good for him, then."
you got that right.
he says, "yeah, that guy's dead,
not from old age."
then he says, "jeez, i'm going
crazy out at the lake."
white bear lake?
the bar's closer to moose lake,
so i made that assumption.
- sure.
- anyway, he's drinking at the bar...
...so i don't think much of it.
but then mrs. mohra
heard about the homicides...
...and thought i should call it in,
so i called it in.
end of story.
what did this guy look like?
he's a little guy,
kind of funny-looking.
- in what way?
- oh, just in a general kind of way.
okay.
thanks, mr. mohra. you're right,
it's probably nothing.
- but thanks for calling her in.
- sure.
looks like she's gonna
turn cold tomorrow.
oh, yeah. we got a front coming in.
yeah, you got that right.
jesus christ.
valerie, i'm leaving this morning...
...back up to brainerd.
<i>- i'm sorry i won't see ya.</i>
you think he's all right?
i saw him last night.
<i>- what did he say?</i>
- it's nothing specific he said.
it just seemed like it hit him
really hard, his wife dying.
<i>- his wife?</i>
- linda.
<i>- who?</i>
- linda cooksey.
<i>no, they weren't...</i>
<i>he was bothering her for a year.</i>
<i>pestering her,</i>
<i>wouldn't leave her alone.</i>
he didn't?
- they never?
<i>- no.</i>
<i>they never married.</i>
<i>mike's had psychiatric problems.</i>
oh, my.
<i>he's been struggling.</i>
<i>he's living with his parents now.</i>
oh, jeez.
<i>linda's fine. you should call her.</i>
jeez, well...
jeez.
that's a surprise.
hello!
mr. lundegaard, sorry to bother you.
can i come in?
yeah, no.
i'm kind of busy here.
i'll keep it real short, then.
i'm on my way out of town,
but i was wondering...
mind if i sit?
i'm carrying a bit of a load.
- no.
- it's about the vehicle.
- i was wondering...
- like i said...
...no vehicles are missing.
- okay. are you sure?
because, i mean, how do you know?
the crime's perpetrators
were driving a car with dealer plates.
and they called here.
it would be quite a coincidence
if they weren't, you know, connected.
- yah, i see.
- so how do you?
- have you done any inventory recently?
- car's not from our lot, ma'am.
how do you know that for sure?
i would know.
i'm the executive sales manager.
- i understand, but...
- we run a pretty tight ship.
yeah, but how do they
establish that, sir?
are the cars counted daily
or what kind of a routine?
ma'am, i answered your question.
- i'm sorry, sir?
- ma'am, i answered your question.
i answered the darn...
i'm cooperating here.
and there's no, uh...
sir, you have no call
to get snippy with me.
i'm just doing my job here.
i'm not...
i'm not arguing here.
i'm cooperating.
we're doing all we can.
sir, could i talk to mr. gustafson?
mr. lundegaard.
well, heck! if you want
to play games here...
i'm working with ya on this thing!
okay!
- i'll do a damn lot count!
- right now?
yeah, right now.
you're darn tootin'.
it's so damned important to ya!
- i'm sorry, sir.
- ah, what the christ!
oh, for pete's sake.
for pete's sake,
he's fleeing the interview!
how do i get an outside line here?
yah, detective sibert, please.
<i>i told you it was over, very clearly.</i>
<i>you made yourself perfectly clear.</i>
<i>but something's come up.</i>
<i>what?</i>
<i>something kind of small,</i>
<i>but it might be a big problem.</i>
<i>i'm pregnant.</i>
<i>huh?</i>
<i>i'm pregnant.</i>
<i>i've had a test,</i>
<i>i've got the certificates...</i>
<i>... and there's no doubt</i>
<i>i'm gonna have your baby.</i>
you should see the other guy.
what the fuck happened to her?
- she started shrieking, you know.
- jesus.
well, i got the money.
all of it. all 80 grand.
that's 40 for you, 40 for me.
that's it, then.
you could have my truck.
i'm taking the ciera.
we split that.
how the fuck do you split a car,
you dummy? with a fucking chain saw?
one of us pays the other for half.
hold on. no fucking way!
did you fucking notice this?
i got fucking shot!
i got fucking shot in the face!
i went and got the money!
i got shot picking it up!
i've been up for 36
fucking hours!
i'm taking that fucking car!
that fucker's mine!
you fucking asshole! i've been
listening to your shit all week!
are we square?
are we square?
yeah, you fucking mute.
and if you see shep proudfoot,
tell him i'm gonna nail his ass!
<i>his wife. he says she was</i>
<i>kidnapped last wednesday.</i>
- the day of our homicides.
<i>- yah.</i>
and this guy was who?
<i>lundegaard's father-in-law's</i>
<i>accountant.</i>
- gustafson's accountant?
<i>- yah.</i>
- we still haven't found gustafson?
<i>- still looking.</i>

<i>- still missing. we're looking.</i>
- copy.

so that was mrs. lundegaard
on the floor in there?
and i guess that was your accomplice
in the wood chipper.
and those three people in brainerd.
and for what?
for a little bit of money.
there's more to life than
a little money, you know.
don't you know that?
and here you are...
...and it's a beautiful day.
well...
i just don't understand it.

people don't much use the three-cent.
oh, for pete's sake,
of course they do.
whenever they raise the postage,
people need the little stamps.
yah?
