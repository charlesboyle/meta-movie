no darling, i was the last one out...
and i did, i promise.
- are you sure?
- yep!
okay!
no, no, i was the last one
'cause i went back in.
and that means the alarm is not set.
cause i didn't set it.
well, i guess that means that we be coming
home to a large bunch of hippies...
...sleeping in our bed.
well, just like your old college days.
it's just turbulence, maria.

i am on it just to check in to see if there
is a message filled later on in japan.
liar.
there should be about text
saying that o'neil should...
have been given us two years of extension
on this contract.
which means the two of us are
doing the same job.
- that can only really mean one thing.
- they can't fire you.
that would be too expensive.
don't worry!
well, i do worry. because we can't
afford to lose this job, can we?
i can go back to work.
- maybe it's time.
- in japan?
no.
oh, you want to go home?
it's not the worst idea, is it?

- no.
after that, when i
came up, i was on my own.
that was the scariest part.
and then i saw the two of
you climbing to the tree in there.
i didn't feel so scared anymore,
because i knew i wasn't on my own. you see?
what if mommy and lucas
are on their own right now...
imagine how scared they'll be.

oh, no!

hey man, are you okay?
get in the car. we will drive
you somewhere safer.
my wife didn't want to come
to thailand for christmas holidays.
because of my leg.
i insisted, my little girl, ginna.
she's just two.
the noise woke me up.
i was alone in the room.
i went out to the terrace and saw the
sea coming in land.
it took me five seconds to reach the
stairs, but the water was already there.
it was not more than five seconds.
on the bed, i found a note from my
wife saying they were at the beach.
- you're at the orchid, right?
- yeah.
my whole family was around the
swimming-pool when the water hit.
i found my middle son first, thomas, he
was on top of this really tall tree.
it took me forever to convince him to come
down, because he was so scared, you know.
and i found my little one, simon,
he was holding on top of a palm tree.
he's only five.
i sent them to the mountains.
you know, so that i can keep looking
for my wife and my oldest son.
toughest choice i ever made.
- have you called home yet?
- i can't find a phone.
i'm saving my battery,
just in case, my family calls.
please.
thank you!
i will be very quick, i promise.
<i>- yes?
- bryan?</i>
<i>yes henry, thank god!
how are you doing?</i>
<i>- did you hear from anyone yet?
- no henry, you're the first call.</i>
<i>is everyone all right?...
henry?</i>
maria and lucas are not here.
<i>what do you mean, not there?</i>
the wave came and swept everyone away.
i found thomas and simon,
but not maria and lucas!...
i don't know what to do or
where to look for them!
<i>henry. you have to calm down!</i>
<i>henry? henry?
- i have to go. many people need this phone, okay?</i>
<i>- i will call you later.

i promise you i won't stop
looking until i find them. ok?
<i>- okay!</i>

because it's nighttime now, but i'll....
i'll look in all hospitals, and i'll
look in all shelters find everything ok.
and i'll... i will find
them, i promise you that.
<i>- i'll call you when i do.
- okay.</i>
<i>- ok!
- ok!</i>
thank you.
can i go with you?
- i'm scared.
- close of your eyes, and think of something nice.
may i sit with you?
how old are you?
almost seventy-four.
and you?
seven and a half.
you can't drop me.
- is he alright?
- yeah, he'll be alright.
with a blanket on him, he's alright.
you like looking at stars, don't you?
i do, stars like alaska constellations.
here, the sky is different.
some of those stars have been
burned out for a long, long time.
did you know that?
they're dead, aren't they?
they're dead, but once
they were so bright...
that their light is still
travelling through space.
and we can still see them.
how can you know which one
is dead and which is not?
no, you can't.
impossible!
it's a beautiful mystery, isn't it?
lucas bennett, can you come with me?
sit here.
your name is lucas bennett, is that right?
- yeah.
- and your mother's name is maria bennett?
is that correct?
