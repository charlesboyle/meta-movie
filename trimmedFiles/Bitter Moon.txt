man:
<i>i still can't believe</i>
<i>we're really on our way.</i>
nor can i.
it's so fantastic.
thank you, darling.
mwah!
oh, don't run away.
i won't be a sec.
<i>( steam whistle blowing )</i>
<i>( blowing continues )</i>
uh, fiona?
fiona?
- stay here.
- <i>oh, blimey.</i>
<i>what's the matter?</i>
- help me clean her up.
-  <i>yeah.</i>
- there.
- gently. there we are.
up-- there we are.
that's better.
i'm going to clean you up.
let's get...
wipe those tears, eh?
<i>( water running )</i>
( vomiting )
oh, god.
just try to take a deep breath.
now take a deep breath.
you'll feel better.
a deep breath
and fresh air,
that's what you need.
here.
you're very pretty.
oh.
there we are.
are you going to istanbul?
yes, then we're flying
on to bombay.
<i>how far are you going?</i>
oh, farther.
much farther.
but why on earth
go to india?
i think-- think we need--
felt we needed a break
from the rat race, really.
and, you know,
india's got so much
to teach the west, doesn't it?
really?
what, for example?
well, um,
you know, inner serenity,
that kind of stuff.
<i>ah!</i>
<i>the karma-nirvana syndrome?</i>
<i>lots of poppycock,</i>
<i>i'm afraid.</i>
no, india's all flies,
smells and beggars.
and as for serenity,
it's the noisiest place
on earth.
( laughs )
well, if you say so,
i'm sure.
now i'm sure mr. singh
is just being modest
about his own part
of the world.
<i>anyway, i can't wait</i>
<i>to get there, darling.</i>
see,
it's my anniversary treat.
we've been married
for seven years.
<i>ah, so it's a form</i>
<i>of marital therapy.</i>
quite unnecessary, dear lady.
with a wife
as beautiful as yourself,
any man would be proof
against the seven-year itch.
what?
( laughs )
( yawns )
you tired, sweetheart?
absolutely whacked.
must be all this sea air.
yeah.
how about a nightcap?
mmm, how about bed?
oh, come on, darling,
just one.
no, honestly not.
you go.
just take me
to my cabin.
i'm out on my feet.
- are you quite sure?
- certain.
anyway, it's bad
for an old married couple
to be glued together
all the time.

you feeling better?
better than what?
you remember, the--

in the-- in the loo.
the loo?
is it your usual
pickup routine?
( slurping )
of course i remember.
i have a perfect memory
when i feel like it.
right.
( laughs )
what is this,
some kind of game?
yeah.
want to dance?
<i>uh, well,</i>
<i>i'm not much of a dancer.</i>
that figures.
<i>( slurping )</i>
<i>what's your name?</i>
nigel dobson.
hi.
okay, nigel, amuse me.
say something funny.
um, blimey.
uh, well, you're french,
aren't you?
<i>i can tell</i>
<i>from your accent.</i>
<i>i mean, your english</i>
<i>is very, very good,</i>
<i>but for some reason,</i>
<i>i can always tell a frog.</i>
sorry.
stupid thing to say.
just slipped out.
schoolboy expression.
comes from working in the city.
i'm a eurobond dealer
<i>and we're always</i>
<i>calling people frogs.</i>
( snoring )
you're right, boring.
um, but anyway, you call us--
you call us roast beef,
don't you?
<i>rosbif!</i> i think that's
how you pronounce it, isn't it?
you're too funny for me,
nigel.
i'm choking with laughter.
so long.
i leave you to your magnetic,
irresistible personality.
man:
<i>romantic, isn't it?</i>
<i>yeah, it is,</i>
<i>splendid.</i>
you're nigel, aren't you?
yeah.
sorry, do i know you?
beware of her.
right.
she's a walking mantrap.
sorry, i don't know
what you're talking about.
sure, you do.
i'm her husband.
look what she did to me.
i'm sorry.
let me ask you something,
nigel.
you don't mind
if i call you nigel, do you?
what do you think of her?
well, if you mean
what i think you mean,
- she's very good-looking.
- <i>good-looking?</i>
yeah, sure,
all of that and more.
she gives you a hard-on,
doesn't she?
i beg your pardon?
come on, nigel,
don't be so british.
you'd like to fuck her.
admit it,
it's no crime.
i've no idea
what you're driving at.
<i>cut the crap.</i>
you're itching to know
some more about her, aren't you?
well, aren't you?
here.
do me a favor,
would you, nigel?
help me over
the goddamn step here,
would you?
they don't design these boats
for my kind.
yeah, sure.
get inside there.
grab the wheels--
the wheels.
up!
( grunting )
( sighs )
ah, i hate
these fucking boats.
it's good of you to take pity
on an obnoxious cripple.
i don't know you at all,
nigel,
but somehow i have the feeling
that you're exactly the listener
that i've been looking for.
i hope you'll find
my story interesting.
i realize it's hard
to relate to something
that doesn't concern you.
but maybe it already does.
we have the place
to ourselves.
mimi has her own cabin.
yeah.
eternity for me began
one fall day in paris
aboard the 96 bus,
which shuttles
between montparnasse
and porte des lilas.
( speaking french )
<i>mademoiselle?</i>
<i>madame?</i>
<i>merci.</i>
<i>merci.</i>
<i>monsieur?</i>
<i>votre billet,</i>
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>
<i>je ne l'ai pas.</i>
i'd been granted
a glimpse of heaven,
then dumped on the sidewalk
at rue d'assas.
oh, i still have no idea
why you're telling me all this.
<i>i'd always wanted</i>
<i>to be a writer, nigel.</i>
( pouring )
my grandfather
made a fortune
in the surgical
appliance business,
set up a trust fund for me.
on his death,
i found myself in receipt
of sufficient allowance
to enable me to move to paris.
<i>paris-- my dream city.</i>
<i>hemingway, miller,</i>
<i>scott fitzgerald--</i>
<i>i was determined</i>
<i>to follow in their footsteps,</i>
<i>maybe too determined</i>
<i>for my own good.</i>
<i>maybe that's what killed</i>
<i>any originality</i>
<i>i ever possessed.</i>
<i>after eight years,</i>
<i>all i had to show</i>
<i>for my literary exertions</i>
<i>were three unpublished novels</i>
<i>and a stack of reject slips</i>
<i>this high.</i>
<i>but who cared?</i>
<i>sidewalk cafes,</i>
<i>fluttering skirts,</i>
<i>fleeting affairs.</i>
<i>paris was heaven</i>
<i>until that day on the bus.</i>
( speaking french )
( sighs )
oscar:
<i>it was no good.</i>
<i>i couldn't write,</i>
<i>couldn't sleep,</i>
<i>couldn't get her</i>
<i>out of my mind.</i>
<i>she was somewhere out there,</i>
<i>my sorceress</i>
<i>in white sneakers.</i>
<i>but where?</i>
<i>i haunted that 96 bus route.</i>
<i>it became an obsession.</i>
<i>even the driver</i>
<i>began to recognize me.</i>
<i>ca va?</i>
( speaking french )
( both speaking french )
<i>( woman speaking french )</i>
( speaking french )
martini. <i>double.</i>
<i>et vous?</i>
<i>un kir royale,</i>
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>
<i>excusez-moi.</i>
( speaking french )
- you're american?
- you remember me?
of course i remember.
you were very kind.
now it's your turn
to do something nice for me.
have dinner with me sometime--
sometime soon, like tomorrow.
- you ever get a night off?
- yes.
- when?
- tomorrow.
mimi.
( speaking french )
mimi.
<i>( piano playing )</i>
oscar:
<i>she told me to meet her</i>
<i>at the centre du marais</i>
<i>at 10:30.</i>
<i>i was so wound up,</i>
<i>i'd gotten there</i>
<i>a whole half hour early.</i>
<i>my nerve ends</i>
<i>were jangling like bells.</i>
here's to old bus route 96.
man:
<i>oh, la la la la!</i>
<i>bonsoir!</i>
<i>bonsoir, monsieur et madame.</i>
( speaking french
with thai accent )
( laughing )
should we just
let him decide?
<i>( speaking french )</i>
( speaking french )
no, no, no,
<i>surprendre-nous.</i>
<i>très bien, tres bien,</i>
<i>très bien, monsieur.</i>
<i>( speaks french )</i>
( imitating accent )
i hope-- i hope-- i hope
i didn't make a mistake
by letting him order
because i don't speak thai
so good
and we might have wound up
eating puppy-dog tails.
<i>( laughs )</i>
<i>do you mind if i do?</i>
( laughs )
( laughs )
oscar:
<i>there was a freshness</i>
<i>and innocence about her,</i>
<i>an almost disconcerting blend</i>
<i>of sexual maturity</i>
<i>and childish naiveté</i>
<i>that touched</i>
<i>my world-weary heart</i>
<i>and effaced the age difference</i>
<i>between us.</i>
my roommate is american.
cindy. you saw her
at the dance class.
<i>i met her when i studied</i>
<i>in new york.</i>
how long were you there?
- till my money ran out.
-  <i>( laughs )</i>
- <i>meaning?</i>
<i>- six months.</i>
i love new york.
it's the best place
for a dancer.
- not for a writer?
- no, not this one.
- i love paris too much.
-  <i>is that what you write about?</i>
<i>paris?</i>
paris and people.
would you let me
read something of yours?
would you dance for me
sometime?
if you like.
- <i>promise?</i>
<i>- promise.</i>
( laughing )
no.
<i>( birds chirping )</i>
i looked all over
for you, you know?
did you ever think
you'd see me again?
yes.
really?
really.
really?
yeah.
you kept it?
my feet are cold.
( exhaling )
oh, you have a fireplace.
- does it work?
- it sure does.
why don't you
relax for a second?
i'll make coffee.
would you like a hot chocolate?
oh, yes, please,
chocolate.
- could we make a fire?
-  <i>why not?</i>
you make the fire,
i'll make the coffee.
and the chocolate.
( whirring )
( beeps )
<i>( doves cooing )</i>
mmm.
oscar:
<i>nothing ever surpassed</i>
<i>the rapture</i>
<i>of that first awakening.</i>
<i>i might have been adam</i>
<i>with the taste of apple</i>
<i>fresh in my mouth.</i>
<i>i was looking</i>
<i>at all the beauty in the world</i>
<i>embodied</i>
<i>in a single female form,</i>
<i>and i knew</i>
<i>with sudden blinding certainty</i>
<i>this was it.</i>
<i>we didn't leave the apartment</i>
<i>for three whole days</i>
<i>after that.</i>
<i>we were inseparable by day</i>
<i>and insatiable by night.</i>
<i>we just lived on love</i>
<i>and stale croissants.</i>
<i>she chucked her job.</i>
<i>i couldn't bear</i>
<i>to part with her.</i>
"i'd been granted
a glimpse of heaven
and dumped on the sidewalk
of rue d'assas.
<i>the gates of paradise</i>
<i>had opened</i>
<i>only to slam in my face."</i>
but they opened again, no?
they sure did, baby.
pretty wide at that.
go on, don't stop.
<i>well, that's all there is.</i>
what a pity.
i could listen to you forever.
( snapping )
<i>( carnival music playing )</i>
<i>bravo!</i>
<i>( speaks french )</i>
oh!
<i>( man speaks french )</i>
( both laughing )
i love you.

you love me?

isn't it dangerous?
not if you know
what you're doing.
why don't you use
an electric?
americans like
electric things.
ha.
not this american.
i know.
it makes you feel macho.
yeah.
you're a real tiger.
( laughs )
( laughs )
you think you're hemingway.
hemingway had a beard.
let me try.
no way, no way.
i value my hide.
- please.
- no.
please, please,
just one little try.
( laughs )
now who can refuse you
anything?
eh eh, like this.
no, nuh-uh. yeah.
not too much of an angle.
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
( gasps ) ah.
oscar:
<i>her pussy was a neat,</i>
<i>discreet little cleft.</i>
<i>but as soon as</i>
<i>the animal within was roused</i>
<i>by my caresses,</i>
<i>it would stir,</i>
draw aside the silken curtain
covering its lair
and become
a carnivorous flower.
a baby's mouth
greedily sucking my finger.
<i>i loved to tease her clitoris</i>
<i>with the tip of my tongue</i>
<i>and then abandon it</i>
wet and glistening,
like a little duck
dabbling in a pool
of pink flesh.
right.
nigel, come on.
don't look so shocked.
eh.
steady on, old boy.
( laughs )
i'm only going
into such detail
to show you
how completely enslaved i was,
body and soul,
by this creature
whose dangerous charms
have made such an impression
on you.
i-- why--
why do you keep saying that?
you mean i'm mistaken?
oh, all right.
i'll let it go.
leave me with my memories.
no, i mean--
if in some way it helps you
to get it off your chest
or something--
what a compassionate fellow
you are, nigel.
actually, i-- to tell the truth,
i should be going.
my wife will think
i've fallen overboard.
<i>you know, you'd have made</i>
<i>a very good analyst.</i>
<i>not many men would have</i>
<i>listened to so much</i>
<i>for so long.</i>
( chuckles )
yeah.
well, anyway,
thanks for the drink.
( door creaking )
what i can't understand
is why he'd think you'd
be interested
in all these sordid details.
i haven't a clue.
he probably lets his hair down
every time he corners
a captive audience.
poor chap.
poor chap?
he's a verbal exhibitionist.
- right.
- it's his wife
i feel sorry for.
yeah.
did i mention i met her
in the bar last night?
- no.
- no, i didn't, did i?
was she feeling better?
yeah, much better.
much better.
she's not bad-looking,
actually.
thank you.
they're coming.
what?
your american friend
and his wife.
nigel.
oh.
just as long as he doesn't
park himself on us.
after what
he told you last night?
he wouldn't dare,
- would he?
- nigel, old chap.
good to see you.
<i>this must be</i>
<i>your lovely wife.</i>
hi there,
i'm oscar.
mimi you already know,
don't you?
- hi.
- hello.
- <i>so do you, nigel, right?</i>
<i>- mm-hmm, yeah. hello.</i>
look, i hate to break up
a twosome,
but would you mind
if i joined you?
<i>we had an invitation</i>
<i>to the captain's table.</i>
<i>trouble is,</i>
<i>i'm allergic to beards.</i>
<i>are you allergic to cripples?</i>
oh!
well, after an intro like that,
how could we refuse?
fine, it's settled, then.
off you go, baby.
thanks.
have fun.
mmm. mimi doesn't share
my aversion.
in fact, she's not too choosy
in general.
<i>can't be.</i>
<i>she couldn't have married me.</i>
<i>what a girl.</i>
knocking 'em dead
as usual.
( chuckling )
just wine for me, white.
anything as long
as it's not retsina.
yes, mimi's very lovely.
but you-- i still don't know
your name, by the way.
fiona.
fiona. i hope you won't
think me forward,
but i find your own brand
of beauty more subtle.
it has that inimitably
british quality--
a kind of reticence that hints
at untapped potentiality.
- ( laughs )
- french chablis, sir.
nigel's been tapping
my potentialities for years.
haven't you, nigel?
well, nigel?
well, come on,
your lovely wife
has just implied
that she's lost
all her mystery for you.
true or false?
no, i mean, i think there's
probably a corner of everyone
that remains to be explored.
halfhearted,
but better than nothing.
well, fiona,
<i>he's right, though.</i>
<i>everyone has secret nooks</i>
<i>and crannies.</i>
every relationship,
no matter how harmonious,
contains seeds of farce,
tragedy.
mmm.
i do not like the look
of that sky much.
i hope the weather's
going to hold.
jesus, don't tell me
you're taking refuge
in the weather.
you know what i hope?
i hope the ship goes down
and we're all marooned
on a desert island.
<i>i'd wind up</i>
<i>the sole survivor.</i>
that's charming.
and why do you say that?
because no one would be
tempted to cannibalize
my shriveled carcass.
<i>( oscar laughing )</i>
i hope he hasn't
been boring you.
no, not at all.
your husband
has a great sense of humor.
<i>black humor,</i>
<i>but still, he's been keeping us</i>
<i>thoroughly entertained.</i>
- oscar: <i>see, baby?</i>
<i>- mimi:</i> <i>see what?</i>
<i>our british friends</i>
<i>find me entertaining.</i>
in small doses, perhaps.
but now we must
leave them in peace.
ah, indeed.
thanks for taking care
of him.
fiona:
<i>not at all.</i>
ah, fiona,
i've already imposed on you,
but may i beg a favor?
as i'm sure he told you,
nigel and i had a chat
last night.
i found him
such stimulating company.
could i borrow him again
this afternoon?
<i>just for an hour or so?</i>
well, he's quite grown up.
he doesn't have to have
mommy's permission.
( laughs )
ta.
oscar:
<i>the seasons came and went.</i>
<i>mimi's face still held</i>
<i>a thousand mysteries for me,</i>
<i>her body</i>
<i>a thousand sweet promises.</i>
<i>but lurking at the back</i>
<i>of my mind</i>
<i>was an unspoken fear</i>
<i>that we'd already scaled</i>
<i>the heights</i>
<i>of our relationship.</i>
<i>it would all be downhill</i>
<i>from now on.</i>
<i>and then something happened.</i>
something that would put things
on a totally different plane.
we were at kitzbühel.
skiing vacation.
<i>i'd rented</i>
<i>a chalet there.</i>
<i>it was one of those nights,</i>
<i>warm and cozy inside,</i>
great fat snowflakes
drifting down in the blackness
beyond the frosted panes,
no light
but the glow from the set,
mimi on the floor wearing
a t-shirt and nothing else,
watching some old american soap
dubbed in german,
and me on the couch
watching her,
<i>sprawled in a sort</i>
<i>of boozy stupor.</i>
<i>all at once,</i>
<i>she got up,</i>
stalked over
to the set,
spread her legs,
and pissed on the screen
like she wanted to blot it out.
<i>time stood still</i>
<i>for an instant.</i>
<i>then i rolled</i>
<i>off the couch.</i>
i crawled over
like a lunatic.
i wormed my way
between her legs
and i turned over.
and right away,
i was engulfed with this warm,
golden cascade.
it spattered my cheeks,
it filled my nostrils,
it stung my eyes.
<i>and then something</i>
<i>jolted my brain</i>
<i>with multi-megavolt</i>
<i>intensity.</i>
there was this blinding flash
in the back of my eyeballs.
i experienced
the orgasm of a lifetime.
for god's sake, man.
it was like a white-hot blade
piercing me through and through.
this was my nile,
my ganges, my jordan,
my fountain of youth,
my second baptism.
look, i think i'm probably
as broad-minded as the next man,
but, i mean, honestly,
there are limits.
stop twittering, nigel.
i'm sharing a revelation
with you, damn it.
i'm trying to expand
your sexual horizons.
oh, i see.
and what makes you think
they need expanding?
i'm sure your tumbles
with fiona
are all perfectly adequate.
very sanitary and hygienic
in their way.
you bloody well
leave us out of this.
i mean,
at least we've got some decency.
what do you think
you're doing,
sharing the details
of your perverted sex life
with a total stranger?
it's just downright obscene.
have you ever felt
real overpowering passion?
have you ever truly
idolized a woman?
nothing can be obscene
in such a love.
everything that occurs
between you becomes a sacrament.
<i>don't you see?</i>
<i>come on, sit down.</i>
<i>have another cup of tea.</i>
<i>it'll steady your nerves.</i>
<i>so, anyway,</i>
that was our sexual rubicon.
it opened up
all sorts of new possibilities.
<i>( pop music playing )</i>
( laughs )
( mimi laughing )
( both laughing )
oscar:
<i>i always had a suspicion</i>
<i>it might be</i>
<i>supremely pleasurable</i>
<i>to be humiliated</i>
<i>by a beautiful woman.</i>
<i>but it was only now</i>
<i>i realized</i>
<i>what this could entail.</i>
( muffled )
mimi.
( grunts )
oscar:
<i>we shut ourselves up</i>
<i>with our toys</i>
<i>for weeks on end,</i>
<i>never going out,</i>
<i>seeing no one but each other.</i>
<i>i guess it was asking</i>
<i>too much of any couple.</i>
- oscar?
- just a minute.
did you really
have all these women?
what women?
the ones you write about.
does it matter?
it's a book,
for christ's sake.
i know,
i'm just curious.
do you like it?
that's what matters.
it's very sexy.
forget about sex
for two seconds.
what do you think
of the quality of the writing?
i can't judge.
my english
isn't good enough.
"my english
isn't good enough."
why read the fucking book
at all?
because i love you.
because i love
everything to do with you.
it's a pity
you're not in publishing.
i'd be at the top of
the best-seller list by now.
<i>when will it</i>
<i>be published?</i>
you tell me.
i'm working on it.

oscar:
<i>i'd always found infidelity</i>
<i>the most titillating aspect</i>
<i>of any relationship.</i>
<i>that scene</i>
<i>should have turned me on.</i>
<i>so why didn't it?</i>
<i>why did i feel so hurt?</i>
<i>pas de cigarette,</i>
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>
<i>( tv playing in french )</i>
hi.
oscar?
why did you do it?
<i>why don't you</i>
<i>say something?</i>
what do you want me to say?
why did you
walk out on me like that?
<i>you don't know?</i>
you started it,
flirting with my old roommate.
you were all over her.
<i>bullshit. we were</i>
<i>having a couple laughs.</i>
and we were just
having a dance.
some dance.
decent of you
not to fuck him on the floor.
oh!
i'm sorry, i'm sorry.
i did it
because i was jealous.
please, please,
forgive me.
you're my tiger.
i don't want
anyone but you!
not ever!
( sobbing )
i love you.
i love you.
oscar:
<i>i loved her too.</i>
<i>but our credit</i>
<i>was running out.</i>
<i>we were headed</i>
<i>for sexual bankruptcy.</i>
<i>( rooster crowing )</i>
<i>( farm animals making noise )</i>
( sniffing )
mmm, i smell pig.
( laughing )
- oscar: <i>don't laugh.</i>
<i>- don't talk.</i>
come, piggy!
where is he?
come, piggy wiggy.
where are you?
( laughs )
- get off! get off!
- ( grunting )
how dare you try
to fuck me, you filthy beast?
- take that.
- ( grunting )
- oscar: harder.
- shut up.
- harder.
- shut up!
aw, you spoiled it.
pigs don't talk.
how can i believe
in a pig that talks?
<i>( rooster crows )</i>
you know something?
i don't believe
in it either.
not anymore.
that was it.
the spell was broken at last.
nigel:
<i>ah, jolly good thing too,</i>
<i>if you ask me.</i>
hate to think
what you'd be up to next.
<i>don't worry, nigel.</i>
<i>there's plenty more to tell.</i>
what makes you think
i want to hear it?
i still don't know
what gives you the idea
that i enjoy being used
as a rubbish dump
for your unsavory
reminiscences.
don't you?
don't you really, nigel?
( laughs )
he's still here?
yeah, i'm afraid i am,
yes.
but i'm just off now.
you know, nigel has been
extremely patient with me.
we don't see eye to eye
on everything,
but we share
at least one interest in common.
you, baby.
<i>i suppose that's why he keeps</i>
<i>coming back for more.</i>
( laughs )
anyway, as i say,
i'm just off.
so thanks very much
for the tea.
<i>toodle-oo.</i>
bye.
<i>( mimi laughing )</i>
<i>( oscar laughing )</i>
- oh! sorry.
- you were gone long enough.
i am really sorry, darling.
i was going
to go to dinner without you.
it's just incredibly hard
to get away.
you saw what he's like.
- she there too?
- who?
wrong answer, nigel.
yes or no would have been fine.
but "who"?
you know perfectly well
who i mean.
oh, right, mimi.
yeah, she rolled up
just as i was leaving.
odd creature.
so you said--
odd, but not bad-looking.
most men
would find her stunning.
most women too,
for that matter.
well, look,
i am not most men.
i'm your husband, right?
there we go.
here they are,
all locked up.
- oh, hello.
- i say, is this
your little girl?
it is indeed.
amrita, say hello
to the lady and gentleman.
- hello.
- hello, amrita.
that's a very pretty name.
it's almost as pretty
as you are.
quite enchanting.
where have you been hiding her?
i have a nanny
that looks after her.
- and your wife?
- i'm a widower, dear lady.
- oh, i'm so sorry.
- that's all right.
anyway, it's lovely
to have a child on board.
yeah, it makes a change
from all the wrinklies.
and you?
have you provided
for your posterity?
sorry?
i mean, you have a wife
that loves children so much.
i was just wondering
if you yourself have a family.
uh, no, no,
we haven't, actually, no.
no, nigel thinks the world
is overpopulated enough as it is
without us adding
to the problem.
well, an admirable sentiment
in india, perhaps,
but surely the green fields
of england can afford
to have a few more mouths
to feed.
what?
oh, i say, look at that. look.
oh, look, amrita, look.
see?
- <i>isn't that beautiful?</i>
<i>- nigel:</i> <i>you cold, darling?</i>
gosh, i should have
brought my coat.
oh, please,
allow me.
- oh, that's very kind.
- here we are.
thank you,
thank you.
i'll just go and--
i'll fetch you something
from the cabin.
- see you in a sec.
- okay.
believe me, dear lady,
children are a better form
of marital therapy
- than any trip to india.
- ( fiona laughs )
you mustn't believe
all he says.
he's a sick man.
he imagines things.
please, don't think
badly of me.
i mean, what are you
playing at this time?
it matters to me
what you think.
does it?
does it really?
i have to talk with you,
nigel.
i have to explain.
all right.
go ahead.
no, not here.
my cabin.
we won't be disturbed there.
please.
um, i can't-- i'm afraid--
afraid i can't, not now.
no, later.
yes?
<i>( fiona talking )</i>
a newspaper!
( laughs )
- brought your coat.
- ah. thanks, mr. singh.
very well.
what a lovely story.
say thank you, amrita.
so if your daddy will let me,
i'll come tell you
some other stories sometime.
would you like that?
( laughs )
two hearts.
pass.
four hearts.
<i>ich</i> pass.
no bid.
pass.
uh, you won't believe this,
but i've got to go and see
that chap again.
i thought you'd had enough
of all that.
i know, it's just he won't
take no for an answer.
uh, i'm so sorry,
but i've simply got to go.
i wonder, would you like
to take my place?
- i should be delighted.
- great.
bridge just keeps on going.
i once played 48 hours
nonstop.
you leave your partner
in safe hands.
excellent.
i do apologize.
please excuse me.
<i>entschuldigung</i> and all that.
( knocking )
mimi ( whispering ):
<i>close the door.</i>
april fool!
( laughing )
you pathetic, sick--
do you want her?
yes or no.
i don't want anything more
to do with either of you, ever.
let go.
let me go or i'll--
"let me go
or i'll call my mommy!"
go on, get out.
crawl back
to your matrimonial tomb.
you know what?
i pity you.
i genuinely pity you both
<i>if this is the way</i>
<i>you have to get your kicks.</i>
i get no kicks out of this,
believe me.
yes, and what was this--
what was this little farce,
then?
<i>how else</i>
<i>could we get you here?</i>
and why is that suddenly
of such incredible importance?
mimi wants you to hear
the rest of our story.
she thinks it'll help
her chances with you.
( laughs )
what are you, her pimp?
i don't begrudge mimi
the right to look elsewhere
for what i can
no longer supply.
i merely supervise her affairs
instead of submitting
to them.
you can have her, nigel,
with my blessings,
on one condition.
you hear me out.
you make me sick.
<i>why are you</i>
<i>still standing here?</i>
<i>( laughs )</i>
<i>come on, nigel.</i>
it was a joke.
have a sense of humor,
for christ's sake.
come on, sit down.
make yourself comfortable.
use my wheelchair.
<i>( laughs )</i>
<i>the brake! the brake!</i>
( sighs )
have a heart, nigel.
don't be too rough on a man
demolished
by a love
that was too strong.
yes, sir.
we should have stopped
right there.
lovers should quit
when their passion
is at its peak,
not wait
until its inevitable decline.
<i>as it was, my desire for her</i>
<i>had begun to wane.</i>
<i>there she would lie,</i>
<i>gorgeous, voluptuous,</i>
<i>and it didn't</i>
<i>do a thing for me.</i>
<i>i came to resent</i>
<i>her failure to excite me</i>
<i>the way she used to.</i>
( man speaking french )
<i>we were developing</i>
<i>a narcotic dependence</i>
<i>on television,</i>
<i>the marital aid</i>
<i>that enables a couple</i>
<i>to endure each other</i>
<i>without having to talk.</i>
( carnival music playing )
<i>a new york editress</i>
<i>was overnighting in paris</i>
<i>on her way</i>
<i>to the frankfurt book fair</i>
<i>and i wanted</i>
<i>to show her a good time.</i>
<i>it was a pr job.</i>
<i>and i was apprehensive</i>
<i>of her reaction to mimi,</i>
<i>who tended to upstage</i>
<i>every other woman in sight.</i>
you wearing that?
mmm.
- that dress?
- what about it?
couldn't you wear
something else?
what's wrong with it?
<i>nothing.</i>
what do you mean, nothing?
you think it makes me
look fat, eh?
you think it makes
my ass look fat.
did i say that?
you think i've got
a fat ass.
you said that.
i didn't.
so you do think
i've got a fat ass.
jesus, mimi,
give me a break.
you wouldn't have said that
once upon a time.
you liked my ass.
i still like your ass.
i'm crazy about your ass.
you don't love me anymore.
for christ's sake,
wear what you fucking want,
mimi.
wear a fucking bathrobe
for all i care.
the trouble is, oscar,
publishing isn't what
it used to be.
it's the bottom line
that counts now.
proven track records,
advance sales.
no one's going
to invest in a newcomer
who hasn't proven himself.
so an unknown
can't get published
unless he's known?
sounds like
a catch-22 to me.
<i>well, you could call it that.</i>
<i>and your parisian settings</i>
<i>don't help any.</i>
when are you going
to come back home?
the united states,
where it's at?
no, you wouldn't do that.
oscar's a fixture here.
he's like the eiffel tower.
he's right, beverly.
i love it here.
- i feel at home.
- <i>good for you.</i>
come on, get a life.
paris is out-- <i>vieux jeu.</i>
<i>it's a literary mausoleum.</i>
<i>henry miller used it up</i>
<i>50 years ago.</i>
<i>god, i don't think</i>
<i>france has been the same</i>
<i>since they gave up absinthe.</i>
oh!
- ah, sorry, i'm fine.
- hey!
- i'm fine, i'm fine.
- let me clean it up.
<i>thank you.</i>
<i>i'm fine, i'm fine.</i>
you know what?
i should make you my agent.
that'd solve all my problems.
"paris is out.
<i>vieux jeu."</i>
you really did me
some good tonight.
like i don't have enough trouble
getting published.
i couldn't bear to see you
crawl up her ass like that.
i'll crawl up the ass
of anyone i fucking well
feel like.
yours isn't the only one
in town.
is that how you feel?
<i>that's exactly how i feel.</i>
in that case,
i'd better go.
<i>okay, you do that.</i>
<i>( typing )</i>
i'm going now.
<i>uh-huh.</i>
- are you sad i'm going?
- uh-huh.
<i>you're not sad.</i>
i am sad.
but it's better this way.
<i>( typing continues )</i>
<i>my keys.</i>
thanks.
( sobbing )
i love you. i love you so much.
please don't make me go.
please.
stop crying.
go make some coffee
or something, huh?
oscar:
<i>i came to dread bedtime.</i>
<i>i would feel</i>
<i>this overpowering desire</i>
<i>to sleep.</i>
gee.
i'm bushed.
( sighs )
oscar:
<i>i'd feel sorry for her.</i>
good night.
<i>lying there with her belly</i>
<i>crying famine,</i>
<i>her organs</i>
<i>in turmoil.</i>
kiss me good night.
not like that.
hold me.
<i>i would crush my lips</i>
<i>against hers</i>
<i>like you mash out</i>
<i>a butt in an ashtray.</i>
<i>but that was only a prelude</i>
<i>to the most unoriginal act</i>
<i>known to man,</i>
<i>the process referred to</i>
<i>as copulation.</i>
<i>i felt like a rat</i>
<i>in a trap.</i>
<i>out there,</i>
<i>people were having fun,</i>
<i>dancing, making love.</i>
<i>paris was throbbing</i>
<i>to its own frenetic rhythms.</i>
<i>they pounded away in my head,</i>
<i>driving me crazy.</i>
<i>i craved variety.</i>
<i>i hungered for noise</i>
<i>and excitement.</i>
( tone beeping )
<i>( pop music playing )</i>
oscar:
<i>yeah.</i>
yeah.
( moaning )
yes.
yeah-- oh, no!
- no! oh! oh, no!
- ( dog growling )
- oh! holy shit!
- ( dog yelps )
<i>do you have to</i>
<i>drink it that way?</i>
<i>why can't you</i>
<i>use a glass?</i>
what's the difference?
it tastes the same.
<i>it doesn't look the same.</i>
oh, la la.
i didn't know
you were so delicate.
- what do you mean, delicate?
- <i>i mean delicate.</i>
i know what you mean,
but it's just not the right word
in english.
if you don't know the right word
in english, say it in french.
i don't say it in french
because your french
isn't good enough.
<i>it's better</i>
<i>than your english.</i>
after all these years
in paris?
so it should be.
maybe your english
isn't that good either.
<i>maybe that's why no one</i>
<i>wants to publish your books.</i>
now you're a literary critic?
that's great
coming from a waitress.
i'm not a waitress.
i'm a dancer.
dancer, hell.
you'd still be begging for tips
if i hadn't picked you up
<i>out of</i>
<i>that fucking restaurant.</i>
( screaming )
( shouts in french )
you little bitch!
okay, show's over.
you can get up now.
mimi.
jesus, don't do this
to me.
baby?
come on, say something.
please.
god almighty.

<i>j'ai mal.</i>

<i>où tu as mal?</i>

is it bad?
how bad is it?
tiger.
should i call a doctor?
just hold me.
baby, forgive me, please.
i love you.
wow, it's great.
thank you.
oh, thank you!
i'm so happy.
what a lovely evening.
i wish it could last forever.
forever's a long time, baby.
i can't think in those terms.
i never could.
when something is good,
don't you want it
to last forever?
<i>sure, but good things</i>
<i>never do.</i>
not even us?
are we so good?
<i>aren't we?</i>
well, now that you come
to mention it, no.
<i>not anymore.</i>
<i>come on, mimi,</i>
<i>let's stop</i>
<i>kidding ourselves.</i>
i don't understand.
look, it was sweet
while it lasted.
boy, it was sweet.
but it's going sour,
isn't it?
- <i>well, isn't it?</i>
<i>- ( sobs )</i>
<i>you know, i've been hoping</i>
<i>that you'd take the initiative.</i>
<i>but, no, you seem quite happy</i>
<i>to let things keep on</i>
<i>dragging on this way.</i>
<i>well, i'm not.</i>
<i>i'm degrading myself</i>
by degrading you.
we're degrading each other,
for god's sake.
let's not spoil
a beautiful memory.
<i>let's quit while we still</i>
<i>have a few shreds</i>
<i>of dignity left.</i>
but i love you.
and i want to--
i want to marry you.
i want to give you babies.
i want to give you
the rest of my life.
i don't want
the rest of your life.
i want my own.
can't you get it
through your head?
what did i do wrong?
did i ever harm you?
oscar, tell me.
even a criminal
is told his crime.
what did i do?
you didn't do anything.
you exist, that's all.
i understand.
oscar:
<i>did i miss her?</i>
<i>sure, i did.</i>
<i>but i also experienced</i>
<i>an incredible sense of freedom.</i>
<i>the future</i>
<i>seemed bright with promise,</i>
<i>peopled with</i>
<i>a thousand alluring images,</i>
<i>most of them female.</i>
( singing in french )
- <i>( phone ringing )</i>
<i>- shit!</i>
<i>oui?</i>
mimi:
<i>it's me. oscar?</i>
i'm here.
<i>i'm scared.</i>
what?
<i>i can't live without you.</i>
i'm afraid you're
just going to have to.
<i>i won't.</i>
look, we've been
through all this before,
haven't we?
so why don't we
give it a rest?
look up some friends,
have some fun.
we just went
over the top, that's all.
in a few days,
you'll be grateful to me
for having made the first move.
<i>( dial tone beeping )</i>
<i>( rock music playing )</i>
oscar:
<i>was she playacting?</i>
<i>i couldn't be sure.</i>
<i>i called her old roommate.</i>
<i>no dice.</i>
<i>i spent the rest</i>
<i>of the day wondering,</i>
<i>half the night drinking.</i>
i was waiting for you.
- i can see that.
i wonder why.
- you know why.
i know i'm wrecked
and i'm gonna crash.
no, wait!
- <i>( dog barking )</i>
<i>- let go of me.</i>
no, i want
to tell you something.
there's nothing more
to be said, mimi.
- please!
- for christ's sake.
it's not going to make it
any easier on us.
you-- you've got
to listen to me, please.
- please listen to me.
- oh, for god's sake.
- please!
- ( barking )
( speaks french )
all right.
you better come in.
( keys jangling )
you want one?
all right.
what's so important?
it's true what i said.
i can't live without you.
oh, if that's all
you came to tell me--
- please don't throw me out!
- it's too late.
give me one last chance.
i'm ready to live with you
on any terms, any at all.
i can't bear anything else
because when i'm with you
sometimes--
( sobbing )
you can shout at me.
you can leave me.
you can have other women.
i don't care
what you do,
but please...
don't send me away.
even if
you don't love me anymore,
keep me with you
out of pity.
there's nothing
i wouldn't do to stay with you.
please, please!
please!
i beg you!
<i>please!</i>
<i>please, i beg you!</i>
oscar:
everyone has a sadistic streak.
<i>and nothing brings it out</i>
<i>better than the knowledge</i>
<i>you've got someone</i>
<i>at your mercy.</i>
<i>if she really fancied</i>
<i>living in a living hell,</i>
<i>i'd make it so hot,</i>
<i>even she would want out.</i>
it feels so good.
yeah, it does, cindy.
cindy?
i mean mimi.
uh, mimi.
( laughing )

- yeah, why not?
-  <i>( door opens )</i>

<i>we'll make a night of it.</i>
<i>mm-hmm. who?</i>
<i>ah, you bet.</i>
<i>it's the best piece of ass</i>
<i>this side of the river.</i>
<i>( laughs )</i>
all right.
yeah, i'll see you there.
<i>yeah?</i>
dinner's ready.
i'm eating out.
tonight?
what's so special
about tonight?
- it's your holiday.
- what holiday?
thanksgiving.
i wanted to surprise you.
all right.
let's see what you got.
christ, what is that?
turkey.
i cooked it
for you special.
cremated it, you mean.
that's it.
i'm off.
won't you even
try a little?
you're joking.
i have too much respect
for my dentist.
listen, in the future,
forget about cooking.
stick to what you can do.
you know, which reminds me,
what happened
to your dance classes?

from the heart.

fiona?
ooh!
here you are.
i wondered where you were.
ah, you missed dinner.
i completely lost track of time.
i'm really sorry.
never mind. dado's been
keeping me company.
good.
how did the bridge go?
it was a disaster.
really?
we had very,
very bad luck.
never had such terrible hands
in my entire life.
never mind, dado--
unlucky at cards,
lucky in love.
may i offer you
a drink?
no, thanks very much.
i think some other time.
are you coming, darling?
goodbye.
bye.
smarmy bugger.
i bet he'd like
to climb inside your pants.
you can talk.
i-- what do you mean?
god, nigel,
i'm not a complete fool.
these sessions
with that american freak.
i know what the attraction is.
it isn't his big blue eyes.
i'm sorry,
i don't follow.
it's his wife you're after.
you've got the hots for her,
haven't you?
what?
i feel sorry for the girl,
that's all.
yeah.
so sorry
that your tongue's hanging out.
just watch it, nigel.
anything you can do,
i can do better.
<i>( fiona vomiting )</i>
oh, god.
darling, i cannot
understand why you won't
take the dramamine.
- i told you, they knock me out.
-  <i>( intercom chiming )</i>
surely-- surely enough,
it's better to sleep
than suffer.
- come on.

<i>don't you, nigel?</i>
if it's not one kind,
it's another.
i don't know why i bother.
<i>sorry, darling.</i>
<i>what're you talking about?</i>
the pill, nigel.
the pill.
we don't do it often enough
nowadays to make it worthwhile.
oh, really.
come on, please.
<i>what are we doing here?</i>
what are we looking for
that we can't find at home?
seven years
and look where it got us.
i realize something now--
we shouldn't go to india at all.
we should be spending
the whole six months in bed.
sorry, darling,
i'm not with you.
too right you're not.
you're somewhere bloody else,
and i know where.
it's like a drug.
<i>actually, that's all</i>
<i>getting very boring.</i>
if you're so obsessed
with your dirty-minded
little cripple
and his sexy wife,
why don't you just go back
for another helping
- and leave me in peace?
- fine!
if that's how you feel,
i damn well will.

<i>my sense of freedom</i>

i hadn't dumped mimi

you may as well sit down

where you been

you bought the tickets.
you should know.
martinique?
you stayed on?
what have you been doing
with yourself?
working at a hotel.
waiting tables?
yes.
till the manager
found out i could dance,
and then he put me
in a floor show.
kind of him.
oh, yes,
he was very kind.
he almost restored
my faith in human nature.
only almost?
he did
until i remembered you.
( laughs )
<i>touché.</i>
what are you doing
back here?
just visiting.
i heard about your misfortune,
thought i'd see
if you needed anything.
you know what i really need,
baby?
i need you
to stay out of my life.
you haven't lost
your charm, oscar.
i should have known.
well, goodbye.
remember the carousel?
sure, i remember the carousel.
i remember it
like a trip to the dentist.
easy, easy!
ah!
ah, ah, ah!
asshole.
did you think i'd forgotten?
she came to see me
when i got out of
intensive care.
she said, "there's bad news
and there's good news.
<i>you're paralyzed</i>
<i>from the waist down,</i>
<i>permanently."</i>
"okay," i said,
"let's have the good news."
"that was the good news,"
she said.
"the bad news
is that from now on,
i'm taking care of you."
oscar:
<i>we were a couple</i>
<i>once more.</i>
<i>she moved back</i>
<i>into my place</i>
<i>and looked after me</i>
<i>with a strange kind of</i>
<i>devotion to duty.</i>
<i>she was my cook,</i>
<i>my housekeeper, my jailer,</i>
<i>and my nurse.</i>
oh, couldn't you--
i mean,
it makes my leg shake
if you always shoot me
in the same spot.
you see?
it makes the leg shake.
couldn't you find
some other place?
oh, you want me
to have another go?
- no, not now, the next time--
- no, i can try it--
now look
what you made me do, silly.
my god, you're not going
to use it again?
none left.
i'll get some more tomorrow.
oscar:
<i>it crossed my mind</i>
<i>that she might</i>
<i>still love me</i>
<i>in spite of everything.</i>
<i>after all, it's no fun</i>
<i>hurting someone</i>
<i>who means nothing</i>
<i>to you.</i>
hey, tiger.
come and get it.
<i>( water running )</i>
aren't you having any?
<i>i'm going out.</i>
nothing in it?
like what?
i don't know,
maybe tomatoes, mushrooms?
oh, would you like
some mushrooms?
- well, yeah,
that would be nice.
- <i>( phone ringing )</i>
you want some,

no, this is his nurse

hey, who says i'm not available?
<i>( woman speaking )</i>
ah, you heard.
<i>yeah, very sad.</i>
- <i>( woman speaking )</i>
<i>- who is it?</i>
no, quite impossible,

<i>( woman speaking )</i>
i will.
you're welcome.

"paris is out.

what did she want?
what did she want,
for god's sake?
how would i know?
well, you might
have let me speak to her.
i said, you might
have let me speak to her.
i heard you.
jesus, mimi,
i never get to see
or speak to a soul these days.
it's like i'm in solitary.
is it?
look,
i know i deserve
all i get.
i treated you
like a monster.
- i am a monster.
- tiger!
you don't have the right
to criticize yourself.
that's my privilege.
- i know.
- <i>i earned it.</i>
but i promise,
i will never hurt you again.
you hurt me?
very funny.
and don't play
with your <i>zizi</i> while i'm gone.
there is no point.
<i>( distant siren wailing )</i>
<i>( door opening )</i>
oh, thank god you're home.
- you missed me?
- <i>what do you think?</i>
as much as you missed me
after you dumped me?
<i>oh, no,</i>
<i>not that again.</i>
<i>please, let's not</i>
<i>have a scene.</i>
why not?
i love scenes.
i've developed
a taste for them.
in fact,
i can't do without them.
what is that?
what do you think it is?
what do you expect
if you go out and leave me
alone all night?
i wet myself, of course.
oh, poor tiger.
i'd better change
your diapers.
god, you stink.
why don't you
just finish me off?
why don't you o.d. me
or push me down the stairs
or something?
oh, i almost forgot.

i didn't remember.

<i>in the world.</i>
so the relationship
had come full circle.
we'd reached a plateau.

to be confessing this
to someone who's hoping
he'll be the one.
now don't deny it.
there's only room in this cabin
for one hypocrite.
well, if you're not
going to stay and have
another drink with me,
you might as well go.
there's no more to tell.
i think i understand you
better now.

yeah, and her.
shit.

let's be adult about this,
shall we?
yeah, adult-- that's the word.
