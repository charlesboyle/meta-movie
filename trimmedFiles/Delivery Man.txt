<i>in many ways, they'll
miss the good old days</i>
<i>someday, someday</i>
<i>yeah, it hurts to say
but i want you to stay</i>
<i>sometimes, sometimes</i>
<i>oh, my ex says i'm lacking in depth</i>
<i>i will do my best</i>
<i>you say you wanna stay by my side</i>
<i>darlin', your head's not right</i>
<i>see, alone we stand
together we fall apart</i>
<i>yeah, i think i'll be all right</i>
- hey, david.
- hey, joey.
your brother's looking for you.
- hey.
- hey, david.
where the hell were you?
- did you take the truck home again?
- yeah.
pop asked you not to use the meat
truck for personal purposes.
- hi, mom.
- but you did it anyway?
uh-huh.
- do you have the jerseys for tonight?
- yes.
no, no, no, seriously. do you
have the jerseys for tonight?
- yes. yes, sweetheart, yes.
- aleksy, hang up.
yeah, sweetheart.
i should never have gotten
this woman pregnant.
do not procreate, david.
reproduction is a very bad idea.
do not reproduce, ever.
hey, i'm sorry.
to pay back some money that i owe,
i've built a little hydroponic
greenhouse in my apartment.
you're... you're growing pot?
and you're the only person
i know with a green thumb.
- and you want me to grow pot?
- yeah.
right. absolutely.
that is the one thing missing for me
right now to achieve total happiness.
getting into a drug ring.
because the pressure of my wife
calling me every three minutes
because she's about to give birth to
my first child isn't intense enough.
how much do you owe?
- eighty.
- "eighty"?
- eighty thousand.
- eighty thousand?
when you say it with that face,
it does make it seem like a lot.
how do you get yourself into
these situations, david?
$80,000?
what happened?
how do you owe someone $80,000?
i borrowed money
to invest in newtech.
- that is a pyramid scheme.
- it is not a pyramid scheme.
- the guy was arrested!
- those charges were unrelated!
- he was arrested!
- david.
you know, david,
i love you like a son.
i am your son.
which is why i love you like a son.
but if you don't have our new
jerseys for tonight's game...
i have the jerseys.
you gotta have the jerseys.
it's the team picture.
i have the jerseys.
he won't have the jerseys.
come on, come on.
<i>your loan has been denied.</i>
but if i don't get the $80,000,
there's people that are
gonna come and drown me.
can you please put that
down on your little form,
that there's people that
are gonna come drown me?
<i>you do not have the
necessary collateral.</i>
that is why we're not
gonna give you any money.
basically, then, you're just
a big goddamn pawn shop.
no, we're not a pawn shop.
you're a pawn shop
with fancy furniture.
and for all these reasons, i have
to turn down your application.
i'm very sorry.
all right. i understand.
this is a hold-up.
excuse me?
i said, "all right. i understand."
this is a hold-up, asshole.
- excuse me, you just said something.
- no.
- just then, you said something.
- no.
i'm here. i'm david wozniak.
i'm here to pick up my jerseys.
- i've been waiting for you.
- i know! i know!
i'm so sorry, but my
team photo is tonight.
the whole team has to have their
jerseys, it's for the whole year.
- all right already!
- thank you so much.
i really do appreciate it.
yes!
- a bag?
- no.
rolling papers?
i grow tomatoes.
hey! it's a delivery truck!
i'm making a delivery.
you're kidding me, right?
yes. i swear i have the
jerseys, on our mother's...
yes! on our mother's grave.
the jerseys are with me
in the truck as we speak.
hey! come on, stop! hey! hey!
you got my jerseys!
- i know it's late.
- yes, it is.
but you brought me
such beautiful flowers.
i did.
and mr. bernstein takes
such great care of them.
where have you been, david?
emma, i'm sorry.
i was trying to pay back
some money that i owe.
i understand, but why
can't you call or text?
and why can't i come to
your apartment anymore?
i never said you couldn't
come to my place.
- are you hiding something?
- nothing.
you're sure you're not hiding
anything in your apartment.
nope.
i'm pregnant.
that's great.
yeah.
- emma...
- no.
you know what? i can...
i can do this on my own.
what do you mean, "on your own"?
i want a child, okay?
but i don't want a father
who just disappears
because he gets too busy.
you're unreliable.
i mean, you've got...
you've got money problems.
you basically don't have a life.
this is not a life.
- i have a life.
- you don't have a life.
people who have a life do not
ring pregnant women's doorbells
at 3:00 in the morning.
i didn't know you were pregnant.
david, you would know.
if you just called me
every once in a while.
<i>i guess...</i>
i guess at first, for a
second there, i was in shock.
i mean, you know, it was a shock.
but then, you know, the...
that feeling of fear went away,
and i got this feeling
that this could be the most beautiful
thing that ever happened to me.
stevie, no. hey, stevie, no!
hey, it's 3:00 in the morning.
go back to bed. go back to bed.
back to bed. not in the sandbox.
hey, where are you going?
no, don't go in the sandbox.
not in the sandbox!
you gotta talk emma into
getting an abortion.
- what?
- you have to.
how could you say such a thing?
how can you say stuff like that
in front of your children?
my children know that they're
too old to be aborted.
i'm realizing that
i might want a kid.
you are a free man.
you do not want kids.
kids are a black hole.
they will suck up all of your energy,
your money, your time, your hair.
remember when i had great hair?
i can't get it up anymore.
how can you talk like this
in front of your children?
i can say anything i want in front of my
children because they don't listen to me.
my children do not pick up on
the frequencies of my voice.
and i'm telling you,
i have a problem achieving
a full erection now.
it's not normal for a man of my age
to no longer have a nice, big erection.
hey, what are you doing?
listen to me, go back to bed.
not in the sandbox.
don't get in the sand.
don't go in the sand!
- as your friend...
- daddy?
no. no, no, no. hey.
- dad.
- back to bed, honey.
daddy.
i'm trying to have a conversation.
please stop that.
- daddy!
- okay, stop that now.
i'm telling you, i think
i might want a kid.
as your friend and as your lawyer,
david, may i be brutally frank with you?
sure.
you don't have the skills
to bring up a child.
i need order in my life.
and this is order?
i think this is beautiful.
daddy!
david wozniak.
uh, the back door was
already broken into.
my name is mark williams.
i'm an attorney.
i've been trying to contact you
for several days now, mr. wozniak.
i do not have a great deal of time.
i shall be brief.
between 1991 and 1994,
you donated sperm under
the pseudonym "starbuck"
at the privately-owned
graboski-levitt clinic,
which i represent.
no.
that was not a question,
it was a statement.
we have all the documents
necessary to prove it.
over the course of 33 months,
you were a very, very frequent donor.
you donated 693 times
in exchange for which you
received the sum of $24,255.
your sperm is of a
very high quality.
oh, thank you.
i'm sure your sperm
is also high-end.
uh...
certain complications arose,
which meant that for a period,
mr. graboski-levitt gave your sperm
to all the women in his clientele.
you have sired 533 children
and 142 of them wish
to know your identity.
what?
you are the biological
father of 533 children.
at the time of each of
your multiple donations,
you signed a
confidentiality agreement.
legally, the graboski-levitt clinic is
obligated to protect your identity.
but a subset of your children
is contesting the legality
of those documents.
they wish to know who starbuck is.
you say that for each of
the 693 sperm donations
you signed a confidentiality agreement
under the pseudonym of "starbuck"?
every time. always.
i always signed the
confidentially agreement, always.
and you signed those documents
before or after executing
the manual labor?
before.
and you always wrestled
the dragon alone?
yes.
frankly, i'm disappointed you
never told me about any of this.
usually you call up your
friends after you get laid,
not after you wrestle
the dragon alone.
but if you absolutely insist,
i promise you i will phone you
every single time i fly solo.
that's an interesting offer.
unfortunately, way too time-consuming.
listen, they claim that your right
to privacy should take a back seat
to their basic human right to know
who their biological father is.
it's very complex.
very, very complex.
it's...
it's really complex.
do you know that this is
the dream of every lawyer
to argue a case this significant?
a case that will leave its mark?
that will stand as a precedent?
my mother always said that
i would never amount to anything.
- i'll show that old bitch.
- what do we do now?
as your lawyer, i suggest you
cease masturbating in fertility clinics.
- do i have to get a real lawyer?
- you can't afford a real lawyer.
i'm gonna call the bar association
today, reactivate my license.
you don't have a license?
i lost it because of
a small formality.
something about a missing dated
form and a bribe. it's nothing.
oh! yes, in hopes of persuading
starbuck to meet with them,
want you to know who they are.
this envelope contains the
profiles of 142 of your children.
do not open it!
brett.
hey, starbuck.
don't call me that.
can susan take the kids?
when she's not investing all
her energy in her new career,
she prefers to wisely use her time
sleeping with men i don't like.
do you have a babysitter?
why, you need someone to
watch over that envelope?
i know i shouldn't have,
but i've opened it.
worst idea ever.
i picked out one of the profiles.
i just picked one.
one. do you know whose
profile i picked?
andrew johansson.
we got to go.
what do you got?
- $225
- $200,
there he is.
let's go, baby. take it. take it.
come on, 13! let's go, 13!
come on, johansson.
yeah!
<i>andrew johansson with the three.</i>
play defense, play defense,
play defense!
play defense, play defense! yes!
do you see him? do you see him?
he stopped it, he blocked it.
he got right in the lane.
did you see him get in the lane?
did you see 13 get in the lane?
we got 13, guys.
why don't they put him in?
why don't they put him in?
the game's almost over.
why are they not...
they put him in!
<i>andrew johansson.</i>
thirteen seconds.
okay, set up. he's open,
he's open, he's open.
hit him, hit him, hit him!
pass it to 13! pass it to 13!
why won't they give it to 13?
give it to him!
he's open! catch it.
got it, got it, got it!
andrew! andrew! andrew!
andrew! andrew!
<i>those were my genes.</i>
my genes were on a professional
basketball court tonight!
in a way, you could say that
that was an extension of myself
that hit that game-winning shot!
i mean, do your kids play
professional basketball?
no, not to my knowledge.
but i will inquire.
they don't tell me everything.
so, i've been thinking that
we could plead insanity.
- what?
- i don't know.
maybe you would not
be held responsible
for actions taken while
mentally unstable.
we could bank on your
mental problems.
i don't have mental problems.
i don't have mental problems!
when we're in court, i want you
to say it exactly that way.
one, two, three, wozniak!
let's go.
come on! one, two.
one, two. one two.
big time, big time, big time!
let's play some basketball.
come in. back up, back up!
hurry up! come up, up, up!
- are you allowed to hit the arm?
- no.
okay. pick and roll!
let's go! back, back,
back! d, d, d!
great steal! here we go, hit me!
i'm going in for the jam.
okay, not a jam.
what the hell position
is he playing?
a little help? thank you.
all right. why don't we
meet up back here at two?
emma!
uh...
give me a second?
i have officially
decided to have a life.
i'm at work.
i'm going to convince you that
i deserve to be this kid's father.
i'm sorry, excuse me.
four days in a row,
i have not had any sleep.
but i've never been
so happy in my life.
i never thought that i would
love anyone that much.
the kid poops four times a day
and i think i'm losing my mind.
i think i'm going crazy,
because i swear
his diapers make me so proud.
i'm totally convinced that my child
takes way better dumps
than any other kid.
your brother wants parental leave
so he can spend more time
admiring his son's diapers.
it's the law, okay?
i'm entitled to parental leave.
i had three kids, and two hours
after each of them was born,
i was here, serving customers.
you absolutely have
to have kids, david.
what?
my girlfriends pregnant.
you got a girlfriend?
yeah.
david, you're gonna love it.
you are gonna love it.
your kid is never gonna
poop as good as my kid,
but you are gonna love it.
- can you believe that?
- no.
i promise, i will
only be gone an hour.
no, i won't. look,
i've called everyone.
how many times have
i covered for you?
oh, my god, man.
i'm begging you, man.
i really, really need
you to do this for me.
i can't even talk to you.
yeah?
can i help you?
i'll have a espresso to go, please.
i said "to go."
is there a lid?
do you have a lid?
usually, you get a lid when
you order a coffee to go.
$3.25.
you could be a bit more polite.
polite?
i'm a customer.
you're a barista.
would it be possible to
act in a polite manner?
what the hell are
you talking about?
i'm talking about a little
"please" and "thank you."
- a little thank you.
- oh, i'm sorry.
is that not considered cool
by your generation anymore?
who the hell are you, man?
i'm just saying if you
smiled a little more,
maybe there would be
more people in here.
if you want to be a waiter...
well, there's the thing.
i don't want to be a waiter.
i'm an actor.
i am an actor missing the opportunity
of a lifetime right now.
and you, because you give me
three bucks and a quarter,
you want me to smile?
you want me to smile when i am
totally pissing away my life?
it doesn't have to be a big smile.
okay.
have a nice day.
good afternoon.
i'll take care of the coffee shop.
yes or no?
customers come in sometimes.
it isn't always empty.
i can't leave you with the shop.
but it's the role of a lifetime.
yeah, and how do i know you won't
just walk off with the cash?
you can leave with my
truck full of meat.
and why would you do this?
satisfaction of knowing
that you helped someone
make something of themself.
bring it back without a scratch.
okay. people might come in.
i can figure out how to
make a cup of coffee.
all right. okay.
thanks.
<i>it is total chaos in the
meat market today, david.</i>
and you decide to disappear?
in the whole family business,
<i>you know you've got
the easiest job, right?</i>
<i>and in spite of having the simplest job,
you manage to do the job badly!</i>
it's like every day you find a new way
to push back the frontiers
of incompetence!
<i>there are only two components
to your chosen occupation.</i>
<i>get meat, deliver meat.</i>
that's not what i ordered.
it's free.
take it, it's free.
<i>you're no longer a "deliverer."
you're more of a "keeper."</i>
why is our truck still
full of meat? why?
why have you only taken
our meat out for a drive?
- yeah?
- i'll have...
tell me who you are
before i call the cops.
i'm the waiter.
i'm the owner.
i do the hiring here.
josh got called in for the
audition of a lifetime.
fine. he can look for
another job, then.
sir, it was the
audition of a lifetime.
that's not the problem.
what's the problem?
he's not a good actor.
he has never been cast.
never.
he's a good kid,
but he's wasting his life.
he's fired.
look, this whole thing was my idea.
so, i guess it's your fault
if he can't pay his rent.
i lost my job?
you lost your job.
i got the part.
you got the part?
yeah, they loved me.
you got the part?
as of today, i'm an actor.
congratulations, man!
- thanks.
thanks, man. thanks.
wow!
i knew it! i knew you
were gonna bail on me.
how the hell am i
supposed to pay the rent?
okay, wait. no, no, wait! wait!
the cash is on the table.
i'm four dollars short.
peter, you owe me money.
no, you owe me money!
okay, so then, what are
you gonna do about it?
you told me june.
tell me, what am i
supposed to do now, huh?
tell me!
what am i supposed to do now?
miss, don't worry about the money.
you, uh, won your pizza.
yeah, you won the contest.
you won our, uh...
you won our "eat and win" contest.
i don't know what you want,
but this is not a good time.
i'm not doing too well right now,
so can you leave my apartment?
yes.
yes, absolutely.
i'm about to call the police!
no. no need for that at all.
it's only that i can see that
you're not doing very well,
and we have a policy
that's very, very, very strict
in the condition in which
we can leave our customers.
here at...
at rocco's pizzeria, we believe
in a more humane pizza.
so, is everything okay?
miss?
shit!
okay, okay, you're okay, you're okay.
you're okay, you're okay, you're okay.
miss. miss!
- kristen?
- miss!
let go of me!
kristen! kristen!
excuse me, and who are you?
are you ashamed to say
you're my father?
no.
may i have a word with you?
yes.
the good news is
that for the moment,
we just happen to have a spot
open in our rehab program.
the bad news is that your daughter
seems totally uninterested
in the program.
since she is still a minor,
it's your decision.
- i'm not...
- it's a very good program.
we've gotten great results.
i'll talk to her.
hi.
how are you?
please sign the release.
look, i don't know
who you are, but...
i'm begging you, sign the papers.
- they have a great program here.
- i can stop on my own.
i mean, i just had the
scare of my life!
- please sign the papers.
- i think the program is...
no, if i do the program then
i'm gonna be surrounded
and i guarantee, i will relapse.
people don't stop using
in these programs.
they stop when they wanna stop.
- they will help you.
- they'll lock me up.
and i'll lose my job. i just...
i just got this great job
and i have nothing in my
life besides this job.
- i'll talk to the...
- thank you.
i'm going to sign the release.
worst decision that
you'll ever make.
she says she'll be happy.
right now she doesn't
need to be happy.
she needs to stop using.
and she will.
do you love your daughter?
i do.
tell her. go tell her
that you love her.
and tell her that you will
not sign that release.
where do you work?
bloomingdale's.
- you're okay for tonight?
- yes.
- and you got my number.
- yeah.
- great. you start work tomorrow at...
- 8:00.
- okay. and you'll be there at 8:00?
- 8:00.
okay.
well...
in my life, i have a tendency
to make very, very,
very bad decisions.
tell me that i haven't just
made another wrong decision.
you haven't.
thanks.
oh, man.
yes.
yes!
thank you, thank you. yes!
whoo!
<i>wonderful</i>
<i>glorious</i>
<i>the sum of all your experiences</i>
<i>a living breathing
result of the fight</i>
<i>and every night you spent
shrouded in darkness</i>
<i>has led you to this moment in the light
it's all right</i>
<i>wonderful</i>
<i>glorious</i>
i've never even tried that.
when you do it, it's different
than regular pilates?
that is why notable
notorious americans,
such as roger morris,
george washington,
eliza jumel and aaron burr...
i'm a writer, too. i like to write.
- oh, that's awesome.
- yeah, yeah.
- you hold me still.
- taxi!
all right.
yeah.
grab my hand.
- just watch me dance.
- okay.
here, just take it.
wow! okay, thanks!
how about hitting this guy up?
yeah! do you feel that?
...have all called the
morris-jumel mansion "home."
- nice!
- thank you.
- exciting.
- thank you.
it's all right.
no, no. okay.
okay, okay!
<i>my love is beautiful
it's here for the taking</i>
<i>it's strong and pure and
utterly earth-shaking</i>
<i>my love has brought me
here to show you it's true</i>
<i>a wretch like me
you'll make it through</i>
hey, come on, buddy,
what are you doing?
you never see a girl before?
wow.
honestly, really?
just keep walking.
that's what i'm talking about.
hey, shorty!
hello, ice queen!
hey, ice queen,
i need a hand over here.
hey, i need a hand right here!
oh!
did you say "ice queen"?
- did you actually say "ice queen"?
- yeah.
don't say that!
don't say stuff like that!
all right.
...all called the roger
morris-jumel mansion "home."
oh! yeah! yeah!
was that unbelievable? unbelievable!
don't forget the money, guys.
<i>and everything became clear.</i>
i had kind of an epiphany.
i cannot be the father
of 533 children.
it's not possible.
it is impossible to be the
father of 533 children.
it is impossible to be the
father of four children.
right! exactly. it's impossible.
but i can be their guardian angel.
their guardian angel?
they need me.
they need a guardian angel.
they need someone to
look out for them.
and i fathered them,
so it's my responsibility.
so, you're telling me that your
purpose on earth is to look out for,
like a superhero, 533 children.
i didn't say "superhero."
out of curiosity,
when you're looking out
for these children,
will you be wearing
any kind of cape?
i didn't say "superhero?
i said "guardian angel."
so, no cape, but you will
have wings and play the harp.
i'm starting to feel more and more
comfortable with this insanity plea.
i do not have mental problems.
say it exactly like
that to the judge.
thanks.
hey, there.
so, today is the first ultrasound.
david, look, i need...
i need a friend.
- i'm a friend.
- i want that to be clear.
it's clear.
okay, well, let's get going.
i drank a gallon of water
and i'm not allowed lo pee
before the ultrasound.
- so, is that the leg there?
- that is.
which one? which one's the leg?
the white spot that you see.
- and is that the head up high?
- that is the head up high.
- okay.
- and we're gonna see the arm.
- that's amazing.
- isn't it?
so, now all the organs are okay?
yep. perfect.
i just passed by the baby's head.
and there's the belly.
my god, do you see the belly?
and there's the whole baby.
that's incredible.
david, i'm not sure.
not sure of what?
look at them. they're monsters.
i mean, look at that one.
look at him.
emma.
this is the most absolute beautiful
thing that can happen to anyone.
who are you? the dalai lama?
what do you mean,
"the most beautiful thing"?
and look at that one.
he's eating his own booger.
it's a great source of protein.
listen.
you are going to be a good mother.
so, herds what.
since i absolutely do
not trust you at all...
what i'm gonna do is,
i'm gonna declare you the father.
- yes!
- no, david, wait.
i'm gonna declare you the
father on probation.
- "father on probation"?
- yeah. you get no slack.
for how long?
forever.
will our child have to call me
"daddy on probation"?
no.
will i have to wear a uniform
that will separate me
from the regular daddies?
- no.
- then, i accept.
we're having a kid.
we're having a kid!
yes.
<i>your name?</i>
- earl monroe.
- and you are?
a friend.
he's over there.
great.
thank you.
you're not going to visit with him?
no. i...
i just wanted to stop
by and see him, and...
- well, now i have, so...
- he would really enjoy it.
yeah, but...
don't worry, just say
whatever comes to mind.
hey, ryan.
one, two, three.
earl monroe.
you did good.
i said nothing the whole time.
i couldn't get a word out.
you were there.
you did really good.
okay.
great.
<i>in athabasca, we set a fire</i>
<i>to the world we left far behind</i>
<i>all the faces, we put away</i>

<i>i got a message, i got a sign</i>
<i>through the wires swinging in time</i>
<i>it's so simple, it's like the sun</i>

sabrina!
hi. i'm sorry, i'm sorry.
- you are late.
- i know, i'm sorry.
thank you very much.
excuse me.
sorry.
excuse me.
look, if we really want
to find out who starbuck is,
we need these guys to help
us put together the strategy
to make sure that this thing
doesn't turn into a circus.
- we don't have the money.
- we can do it on our own.
the objective wouldn't be
to always have them there.
i think if we just take the time to
check out what they've proposed...
i simply wanted to express the fact
that i feel we were
better off without them.
yes, gentleman in the blue.
do you have a comment?
i just want to say that...
i don't know all of you here.
but...
but you're all focused, a lot,
on finding starbuck.
but, whatever happens,
you're all brothers and sisters.
you've all found one another.
- hey!
- hey!
- hi.
- hi.
what are you doing here?
i'm... yeah... you know, i'm...
i'm the father.
i'm the adoptive father.
i'm ryan's adoptive father.
- ryan?
- he's not here tonight.
he's at a home for the disabled.
he's disabled,
and he just couldn't make it.
- hey!
- hey.
kristen. this is...
- taylor.
- yeah. taylor saved my life.
he saved my life at the pool.
he's a lifeguard.
and i'm the adoptive
father of ryan,
and he couldn't be here,
because he's handicapped.
you're the father of
one of the children?
- adoptive.
- oh, wow.
- how's it going?
- hey, hey, hey, josh!
yeah.
josh, this is taylor,
and this is kristen.
how's it going?
josh worked at a coffee shop,
and he is now an actor.
josh, this is taylor.
taylor is a lifeguard.
he saved my life a few months ago.
and this is kristen. orders pizza.
she is also an ex-drug addict.
and i'm the adoptive father
of a young disabled man
who couldn't be here.
and his name is ryan.
hey, you're the guy from the park.
- hey.
- how are you?
great.
josh, kristen and taylor.
- hey.
- how are you?
what's up? adam.
kristen has got a great job,
and she's still...
yep, i'm still working
at bloomingdale's.
so the job, which is great.
everyone's doing great.
and i'm the adoptive
father of a disabled...
young disabled man.
ryan, who was obviously...
unfortunately, was in conflict
with some of the disabled days
of doing the activities and
stuff that we're involved in.
so, i got the stuff for him.
i gotta run out of here.
but everyone looks good.
- good to see you.
- great. great to see you.
taxi!
as of tonight, you are officially part of
a mass action lawsuit against yourself.
what the hell are you doing here?
a bit of reconnaissance work.
what the hell are you doing here?
i was following one of my kids...
but why are you doing this?
who does things like that?
i don't know, i was curious.
- stop!
- stop what?
stop everything for
the rest of your life.
every time you have an idea,
i want you to come to me,
and as your friend,
i will shoot your idea down.
you're not a normal person, david.
i am a normal person.
david, we've known each
other for 20 years.
i can tell you for a fact,
you are not normal.
i'm very normal.
really?
- what about mariouka?
- i don't see the point...
five years ago,
you married a russian woman
that you had never met.
she needed to get into the country,
and she promised to clean
my apartment for a year.
and she disappeared after three
days with her real husband.
david, how much money did you
lose importing cuban cigars?
that guy looked very honest.
he was in his bathing suit!
since when does anybody do business
with a man in his bathing suit?
listen, for the first time in my life,
i think i'm doing the right thing.
you're not doing the right thing.
stop seeing your kids!
where's our money?
i'll get it! i said i'll get it.
<i>it's now $ 100,000.</i>
so, i really need you
to lend me some cash.
tony. it's david. yeah...
hello?
phil! buddy, how are you?
rob!
nelson!
all right, don't worry, man.
i understand.
no, no. i'll catch you soon.
hello, david wozniak.
all the profiles.
and i saw on your overdue bills
that your name is david wozniak.
i was sitting behind
you at the hotel.
my name is viggo.
i'm your biological son.
are you gonna expose me?
i don't know.
i don't even really know why
i ever wanted to meet you.
who are you?
what do you do for a living?
i work at a meat store.
i'm a vegetarian.
so, you murder animals.
no. i deliver the meat.
i don't murder it.
i chauffeur it around.
leo tolstoy says that,
"if a man earnestly
seeks a righteous life,
"his first act of abstinence
is from animal food."
i did not know that.
sir thomas more said,
"the utopians feel that
slaughtering our fellow creatures
"gradually destroys the
sense of compassion
"which is the finest sentiment of
which our human nature is capable."
that's interesting.
can we keep this our secret?
can i stay here a few days?
i need to get to know you.
it has only been two weeks,
and he has become unbearable.
again this morning,
he called me three times.
that's three times this morning.
he's taking up all of my time.
do whatever he wants.
we can't let him expose you.
long conversations.
long, like police interrogations.
he feels the need to bond.
do whatever he wants,
or he will expose you.
he wants to point out books that
are so dense and so esoteric
that it's impossible to
make heads or tails of it.
and then he'll twist it and
ask if i agree with it,
and then, he'll use it to prove
that somehow i'm full of shit.
i'm not having conversations
with him, brett.
i'm in a chess game that
i don't realize that i'm in.
and it's exhausting. it's draining.
no.
- answer it.
- no!
you have to answer it.
anything he wants.
<i>- hey, i got you a kale salad.</i>
- you got me a what?
kale salad.
i'm kidding.
i got you a triple monster burger.
yes, please.
hey, should you be
painting like this?
because i can do this.
i can do the painting.
i'm happy to do it.
thank you for being here.
i'm glad i'm here.
- but i'm excited to do the painting.
- yeah?
from now on,
let me do the painting.
- all right.
- okay.
i got you some french fries.
- you got french fries, too?
- yes.
and there might be
something else in there.
really?
a little treat?
you got me two burgers!
so, i'm trying to cancel
tomorrow night with emma
and i think i can get off a bit early,
so we can do whatever.
whatever you want. tomorrow
night will be viggo's choice.
all right, i'm off.
good game, david.
everything okay?
yeah.
you want to play?
yeah!
all right. come on,
get your stuff. let's go.
we gotta hurry.
careful, careful, careful.
do you have any
sweatpants, or anything?
no.
you don't want to wear that stuff.
it's not a nightclub, viggo.
do you have any shorts for me?
i don't think my shorts
are gonna fit you.
like this.
what?
up there.
dribble, dribble, dribble.
oh' my...
you just gotta dribble.
you gotta dribble.
so, you just... you just dribble.
dribble, dribble! you gotta dribble!
you gotta...
why doesn't he dribble?
david, you absolutely have
to be there next saturday.
everybody's gonna be there.
actually, i have plans
next saturday with emma.
but you were the one who came
up with this whole concept
of brothers and sisters
finding one another.
yeah, i understand, but i
already have plans with emma.
anyway, i spend a heck
of a lot of time with you.
you know, i also
have a real family.
family.
you said "real family."
- no.
- you... you...
just because you
decided to turn the page
on that period of your life
doesn't mean we don't exist.
we exist. we exist for real.
we're also your real family.
viggo.
viggo!
all i'm saying is,
i hope that you're happy.
i hope you realize that i had
to lie to emma to be here.
that i lied to the woman
carrying my child.
your "real" child.
viggo, we have talked
about the incident a lot.
i don't think we need to continue to
dwell on our little misunderstanding.
i am here.
do you see that i'm here?
do you see that i am here?
- with your fake kids.
- fake?
fake? viggo, what the hell
are you talking about?
i mean, if we're not real,
what are we?
- nietzsche said...
- screw nietzsch-ka!
screw kindergarten!
"kierkegaard?
i think it's this way.
screw nietzsche! screw kierkegaard!
and screw... the...
you can't even come up with one more.
that's it, you're done at two.
look, screw all of those dudes.
none of those guys had 533 real kids.
did you bring me here to expose me?
no.
i want to keep you all to myself.
<i>i know it's coming
i can feel it in my bones</i>
all right!
<i>this is information
you already know</i>
<i>even if it's only temporarily</i>
<i>give the illusion tonight
you belong to me</i>
<i>oh, the things</i>
<i>i will believe</i>
<i>ignore the hundred lovers</i>
<i>you got hidden up your sleeve</i>
<i>the words come easily</i>
<i>and they sound so lovely</i>
you all right?
<i>i guess it's just as
easy if you lie to me</i>
- put these next to the grill, here.
- next to the grill.
special recipe.
it's a secret family recipe,
but you'll like this.
wow!
do you see what happens
when the tofu hits the grill?
nothing.
exactly what happens when
the tofu hits our taste buds.
<i>i am alone
i am in love with an idea</i>
<i>sophisticated neurological appeals</i>
<i>i want to negotiate
some kind of a deal</i>
<i>i want to tear it open
show you that it's real</i>
<i>oh, the things</i>
<i>i will believe</i>
<i>ignore the hundred lovers</i>
<i>you got hidden up your sleeve</i>
okay. get in nice and tight.
all right, we got one more.
get in close.
- all right.
- can i get in?
all right.
okay, everybody, just scooch in.
get as close as you can.
okay, on the left.
can you move in just a little?
all right. say, "cheese."
cheese!
<i>and i'm real, real gone</i>
<i>got me down to the very marrow</i>
<i>don't you know i need your help</i>
<i>you're a friend of mine</i>
<i>and i'm real, real gone</i>
hey. this is ryan.
- hey, ryan.
- what's up, ryan?
- hey, ryan.
- hi.
<i>that was the best, right?</i>
i had a great time.
so, uh... i guess this is it.
have a great day.
ryan?
could i just have a...
just... thanks.
i...
i just wanted to...
i wanted to tell you...
i'm your father.
okay.
so...
you'll keep seeing more of me.
that was a fun weekend. okay.
you seem way too relaxed.
this is a great moment for me.
it's a new stage in
our relationship.
no.
- no?
- no.
it's really important that you
know there is no truth in anything
they are going to
say about me. none.
you must understand,
they love to humiliate me.
they're monsters. really.
- they are monsters.
- okay.
i want to propose a toast to emma.
because i think it's important
that you know that this...
- rite of passage.
- rite of passage.
well, it's not just about
humiliating david.
although, it is one
of the objectives.
and if we have exposed david's
past to the harsh light of day...
well, i think it's important, because you
gotta know what you're getting into.
and now that you know all this...
i have some more pictures.
not sniper.
sniper?
it was his rock band.
they wore a lot of makeup.
it was the '80s.
everybody wore makeup.
i didn't wear makeup in the '80s.
but look,
now that all this is known...
i think it's also very
important for you to know
that the wozniaks have
had some wonderful times
- and some hard times.
- no.
dad?
when my wife and i were newlyweds,
we always dreamed of having
a honeymoon in italy.
but we didn't have much money.
then we had children.
we told ourselves, someday,
when we're old.
but time passed.
you have to make the
most of the present.
do you all make the
most of the present?
yes.
yes, dad. we make the
most of the present.
when my wife fell ill,
david came over one day with
plane tickets to venice.
he had seen to everything.
the hotel near doge's palace,
the gondolas.
then later, our three sons
flew over and joined us.
we had a big family dinner
near st. mark's square.
david paid for everything.
david...
he does things like that.
if you are able to live
with his countless faults,
you will also live through
some marvelous times.
let us pray.
- no.
- come on. dad, please.
- let's drink.
- yes.
your father is adorable.
yeah.
i can't believe you brought
your whole family to venice.
how did you pay for that?
i had money.
when you were 20?
- yeah.
- wow.
what kind of job did you have that
would pay for a trip to venice?
it was a manual-labor type job.
that was an awesome meal.
almost.
all right, let's bring it.
open the flood gates, here-.
have fun. okay, have a
good day at school, guys.
have a good time.
it's okay to like recess. how are you?
look at these angels.
my man, how you feeling?
have fun, buddy.
coffee? toast? eggs?
- no.
- how was your weekend?
- relaxing.
- good.
very relaxed.
dinner with the family.
and i read.
<i>lord of the rings.</i>
that you lie to your girlfriend,
that's par for the course.
untruthfulness is the basis of
a good, strong relationship.
but i'm not your girlfriend, david.
so, before you tell me
that you spent the weekend
with frodo and gandalf
and bilbo baggins,
why don't you go ahead
and take a look at this?
well, as you can attest,
the reporter won't be winning any
prizes for his journalistic skills.
but apparently, his story
was picked up by cnn
and fox, and even the bbc.
which means, when you
go to bed tonight,
four or five billion people will be
asking, "who the fuck is starbuck?"
now tell me, is this
good news for us?
does this augur well for our trial?
is this the type of situation
over which we can regain control?
the answer is yes.
now, we go on the offensive.
a countersuit. we, too,
are going to sue the clinic.
what for?
substantial punitive damages.
it's the clinic's duty not to do
anything to jeopardize your anonymity.
by overusing your donations,
they have given rise to a substantial,
well-funded challenge
to your anonymity
which has now generated
extensive media coverage.
i mean, you should hear the stuff that
people are saying about starbuck.
what are they saying
about starbuck?
terrible things. but it's good.
it's fine,
because our countersuit...
david, your debt
problems will go away.
we're going after big, big money.
<i>it is all over twitter,
it is all over the net.</i>
<i>no way is this guy coming
out of the closet.</i>
<i>no way!</i>
<i>at work, every meeting you go into,</i>
<i>no matter what you say,</i>
<i>everyone will always be thinking,
"hey, it's</i> el masturbator."
<i>five hundred and thirty-three kids!</i>
<i>he's donated 693 times!</i>
<i>boy, this guy was making money
hand over fist. i can't believe it.</i>
<i>anyway, listen. he went
by the code name "starbuck."</i>
<i>"starbuck"?</i>
<i>i think "chock full o'nuts"
would have been more like it.</i>
<i>"chock full o'nuts"
would have been better.</i>
you should read some
of these tweets.
<i>the last kid was an accident.</i>
<i>i guess he was watching
a rerun of baywatch,</i>
<i>and it just happened.</i>
<i>i had no idea this could
actually be a job.</i>
<i>i mean, i knew it could be a hobby.</i>
what do you think about
all this "starbuck" business?
oh, it's horrible.
what's horrible?
it's horrible. you don't think
it's absolutely horrible?
- i don't know.
- what was he thinking?
well, he obviously wasn't thinking
that they would use his sperm so much.
and he obviously wasn't thinking
that they would choose
his profile so often.
may i help you?
yeah, do you have a
stroller for 533 children?
- no.
- no. no.
he doesn't.
because it's not normal
to have 533 children.
it's not normal.
viggo, where the
hell are you going?
- i don't know.
- it goes in the back.
- in the back.
- okay.
hey, david.
your brothers are in the office.
they want to see you.
they wanted 100 grand! 100 grand?
i mean, pop didn't have it.
so they tried to drown him!
what were you thinking?
tell me, david,
what were you thinking?
get the cash, david.
get the cash!
unbelievable!
- dad, listen.
- go away, david.
go away.
let's...
let's do the countersuit.
excellent. excellent.
- come on in.
- all right.
<i>what would happen if we no longer</i>
<i>respected these types
of agreements?</i>
nothing less than an
unlimited quantity of chaos.
custody battles.
possible intrusions
upon happy families.
and this, on either party's side.
<i>mothers showing up on
donors' doorsteps.</i>
<i>and donors suddenly
wanting visitation rights,</i>
<i>wanting to partake
in important decisions</i>
<i>about religion, about schooling.</i>
none of the parties were coerced
into signing this agreement.
and nowhere have i seen
an expiration date.
what'd you guys think?
why don't i understand
when you are talking?
well, you see...
this is a complex situation.
i would vote for the other guy.
well... no. the other guy is wrong.
grandma's right. i think
you're gonna lose again.
did she say that?
okay. well, all right.
thanks, kids.
you can all go to bed.
is that going to be
your argument in court?
that won't work in court.
you can't send the real judge to bed.
yes, i can. daddy can
send anyone to bed.
and right now,
you're all going to bed.
now, go.
these are children who are lost.
they are lost in the wilderness.
and they want to know
who their father is.
i mean, is that too much to ask?
and what would...
what would happen if we no longer
accepted these types of agreements?
nothing more than an
unlimited quantity of chaos.
um...
the mic...
oh, that's better. is that okay?
here we are, outside of
the new york courtroom...
i feel like this is
an easy case to win.
<i>what i'm saying is,</i>
<i>which fundamental right should
take more importance here?</i>
<i>i've been a musician
pretty much my whole life.</i>
and when i write music,
i write it because...
i think, when i say this,
i speak for everyone.
i know, how for me...
i wasn't actually able
to grow up with a dad.
i would like to meet the guy,
the man, who created me.
and there's a lot of transitions
in my life that i've come across.
it's central to who i am.
it's really all i've thought about.
i just want to feel like
i have a part of myself.
the last ultrasound that
is on friday at 2:00,
do you think that you
can make it there?
there is no contract, okay?
they've broken the contract!
they break with the contract!
the man signed an anonymity
agreement for 693 donations!
he has a right to punitive damages,
because you should hear what
people are saying about him now.
- you have got to be prepared!
- i am prepared!
well, then why don't you do it?
you're my friend, i'm sorry.
- i'm just so pissed off.
- yeah.
so we hope that it
has been made clear
that the intentional blocking
of this vital information
has had, and will continue to have
a negative psychological impact
on each and every single
one of starbucks children.
in finishing,
while the donor may have bargained
for confidentiality with the clinic,
and the parents may have
accepted that confidentiality
as a condition to receiving
the sperm donation...
the children didn't
agree to anything.
yet, they are the ones, they are
the ones most directly affected.
this makes no sense.
thank you.
these are some great kids.
without the anonymity clause,
none of them would be here.
and not to have these
beautiful kids,
that would be a great loss.
we need the anonymity clause.
the court will now take the
matter under advisement.
how long could it take?
i don't know, david. i do not know!
what don't you know?
i know absolutely nothing!
my mother was right.
i'm useless and i'm
out of my league.
you should have got
a real lawyer, david.
all rise!
you may be seated.
in the adjudicated action,
the parties will receive
a detailed document,
in which you will read
that starbuck is entirely,
and without reservation,
entitled to remain
anonymous.
he will also be entitled to
$200,000 in punitive damages
from the graboski-levitt clinic.
you are adjourned.
starbuck, therefore, will be entitled
to remain completely anonymous.
he also will receive
$200,000 in damages.
yes! yes!
brett, what's your
reaction to the verdict?
obviously, i feel great
compassion for the children.
but i am very, very happy.
i am very proud to have vindicated
my client and his rights.
<i>and i want to say thank you to
my own children and to my mother.</i>
<i>mom, i won.</i>
<i>i won.</i>
<i>and i just want to say,
david, we did it!</i>
no!
<i>we did it, david!</i>
- no.
- who's david?
<i>he's my lover</i>
<i>who has always been there for me.</i>
<i>and, david, my darling...</i>
<i>i love you, david.
i love you, david.</i>
obviously, a very emotional
trial for everyone here.
did you expect this verdict?
we're disappointed.
our case was dismissed, and we've now
exhausted every possible legal recourse.
but we haven't lost everything.
while we were told today there's no law
requiring starbuck to identify himself,
there's more to this than
just legal obligation.
there's us, and there's him.
and beyond any law,
there are human beings.
so, ultimately, the final
decision is starbucks.
he's under no legal obligation
to identify himself.
<i>but now that he's seen all of us,</i>
<i>he may well decide to do so.</i>
<i>that decision is his.</i>
<i>there has been a lot of unfavorable
comments about starbuck</i>
<i>in all of this media coverage.</i>
<i>we would really just
like our father to know</i>
<i>that in our eyes,</i>
<i>he's not a criminal or a freak.</i>
<i>to us, he's someone</i>
<i>who gave life and happiness
where it was badly needed.</i>
congratulations, darling.
i had it.
i had pitched the perfect game and
i had to screw the whole thing up.
my mother saw the
whole thing on tv.
well, she must have been surprised
to find out that you had a male lover.
no. she said she
always suspected it.
she told me we make
a lovely couple.
and your kids?
- they think it's cool.
- mmm.
i'm just wondering...
and really just
theoretically, but...
if i decided to identify myself,
would i lose all the money
from the countersuit?
yeah, i think you would.
emma always says that, uh...
that i don't have a life.
so, um, i officially set out
to try and do the right thing.
it's harder than i thought.
pop.
pop, i'm starbuck.
you are <i>el masturbator?</i>
yeah.
now, for once in my life, i'd
like to make the right decision.
once.
for once in my life, i would
like to be a normal person.
how would a normal person
handle a situation like this?
a normal person would
not be in this situation.
let's just say that a normal person
had a slight lapse of judgment
and donated sperm 693 times.
what would they do?
what would my brothers do?
your brothers are not
mentally equipped
to deal with a situation like this.
when you get right down to it,
you're probably one of the
few people on this earth
able to deal with such a situation.
why not just tell them?
as you know,
i have some money problems.
yeah, your debts.
you know i grew up in
terrible, terrible poverty.
yes, i know, pop.
i know.
when i left warsaw to go to the
states, my father gave me $10.
that was everything he had.
i couldn't turn down his help,
sol promised him i'd pay him back
my father died
when your mother and i
still didn't have a cent.
i...
i always wondered what
was harder for him.
not being able to give
his children enough,
or not being with them
when they hit hard times.
my great good fortune in life
is to see you boys every day.
that, for me, is success.
so, like my father,
i want to help you.
here is $10.
it brought me good luck.
with $10, i built my empire.
so, take the $10.
and also take...
it's your share of the meat store.
it's your inheritance, in small bills,
to pay off your debts.
i'm scared i'll disappoint them.
why would they be disappointed?
i'm a meat truck driver.
i'm an incompetent
meat truck driver.
true, you are incompetent.
it takes you four times longer to
deliver meat than anyone else.
but wherever you go,
people love you.
they're going to love you.
everyone loves you.
thanks, pop.
we'll be right with you, sir.
emma!
emma!
mr. wozniak?
you gave us a little scare, there.
yeah.
hi.
mr. wozniak?
yeah.
your family is here to see you.
is he healthy?
yes.
does that mean he
can work tomorrow?
this is weird.
hey.
i lied to you.
i am your biological father.
and you have a little brother.
he was in a bit of a hurry. but...
he's doing very, very, very well.
can we see him?
i'll find out.
hey.
he's so small.
emma.
will you marry me?
wouldn't you want to wait and
see if i get my figure back?
if you stay flabby, i promise
i'll get flabby as well.
i wonder if that's the first
time the word "flabby"
has been used in a
marriage proposal.
emma...
i'm starbuck.
why are you always scamming?
god, how could you think
that a marriage proposal
would excuse the fact that you're
the father of 533 children?
david! god!
how...
this is no longer your child.
i want to be very
clear on two points.
the first point.
i said i was gonna change
as quickly as possible,
and i am doing that.
i've had a chance to do a
lot of thinking. a lot!
and i've come to the conclusion
that it's not anyone but me
who can decide if i
am the father or not.
not a judge, not my
family, not dr. phil,
and in the end, not you.
in other words, nobody but the father
can decide if he is the father or not.
and i, david wozniak,
am the father of this child.
the other reality that can't be changed
is the fact that i am starbuck.
now, this, obviously,
can be somewhat frightening
since it's something totally new,
and no one on this planet
has ever experienced
it before. it's...
it is like the first
steps on the moon.
but despite a few drawbacks,
i think that we can actually
take away from this
a tremendous amount of joy.
not to mention, vast amounts
of free babysitting.
i don't know how this
is gonna work out.
right now, me coming out
and revealing who i am,
i'm risking everything.
i'm risking all for the
well-being of my 533 kids.
and i would think that
you seeing me risk all
should convince you
that whatever happens,
that no matter what turmoil this kid
right here gets into, i will be there.
now, you asked me to have a life.
well, here it is. this is my life.
it may be a bit strange.
and a bit oversized.
but it's my life.
the second point.
that was a very long first point.
the first point was long.
the second point...
the marriage proposal
was not a scam.
the second point was much shorter.
i need you in my life.
promise me, one day
you'll take me to venice.
okay.
