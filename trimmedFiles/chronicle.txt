filming everything from here on out.
<i>and it is yours
right now for only 46.50! yeah!</i>
mom? mom.

of people that are watching at home.

i'm filming everything.
you're filming everything?
yeah.
okay.

have you ever read
any arthur schopenhauer?
no. what is arthur schopenhauer?
he's, um... he's this philosopher
that i'm reading at the moment.
for school?
no, no.
uh, basically, human beings
have to recognize themselves...
as beings of pure will, right?
okay.
so all emotional and physical desires
can never be fulfilled.
so basically you're telling me
that i should give up on life.
yes. okay.
- come on, man!
- oh, god.
- i'll see you later.
- all right, dude. peace.
learning time.
get out of the way.

'cause i don't wanna
see anybody pull up. that's right.

i don't go to parties.
you're a senior. you are a senior.
i don't go to parties.
just come.
i'll think about it, okay?
okay.
but when we go tonight, andrew,
can i give you, like, a pro tip?
what?
maybe leave your camera at home.
why?
because it's a little weird.
it serves a purpose.
i'm... i'm just trying to be
a good cousin here, okay?
this is me being your friend
and telling you...
you should probably
not take the camera to a party.
okay.
this is my street.
and those are the official
douche bags of my street.
what the hell's that?
oh, great.
hey! what you doing?
andrew!
no, i wasn't... don't film me, detmer!
don't film me.
run to your house, bitch!
<i>this is where i eat lunch.</i>
<i>out here on the bleachers.</i>
what do you want?
when i say open that door, you
open the door. you got it?
finish your goddamn homework.
matt, are you sure it's here?
dude, it's here. calm down, okay?
oh, yeah.
wow. look. a rave.
oh, wow. look.
a nerd with a camera.
what? just don't follow
me around all night, okay?
what do you mean? i thought... i thought
you wanted me to come with you.
i did. i did. but just go and do
your own thing for once, okay?
i don't drink.
hey! hey!
hey!
excuse me.
hey! hey, what are you filming for?
oh, i don't... um...
oh!
what?
- i can't hear you.

- oh.
andrew. andrew. you should check it out.
it's actually...
oh, hey. hey, casey.
hey.
how you doing?
i'm good. i'm good.
this is pretty lame, right?
why is it lame?
you know, jung said
parties are just...
people's way of
seeking widespread validation.
i'm not one to clamor
to be cool, you know.
wow. way to put an analytical psychology
spin on this barn party, matt.
that's awesome.
awesome.
- you're awesome.
- hey, matt.
hey, what did jung say about glow sticks?
you filming my girlfriend?
yes or no?
no, i... i'm not filming anything.
i'm just filming the party. okay.
i should break your bitch-ass nose.
you know that?
no, i wasn't...
don't talk back to me.
bitch.
okay.
andrew?
andrew.
andrew.
with the camera.
can we... can we use that thing?
what?
we found the craziest shit,
and we gotta get it on tape.

you okay?
yeah. i'm... i'm andrew.
okay. i'm steve.
steve montgomery.
yeah, i know.

matt and i were just hanging out,
and we found this cool little...
this thing.

you might want to get it on tape.
no, i just... i don't really.
dude, just come on.
just come get it on tape. it'll be cool.
i don't know.
trust me.
all right.
yeah, man.
you know there are, like,
tons of girls around here, right?
and you're all by yourself
next to a tree?
i'm just really picky.
listen. i really don't think... is there a
light on that thing? like, on the camera?
uh, yeah. here.
what were you guys
doing out here?
a bunch of people were out here 'cause
we were, like, obsessed with the thing.
what thing?
you'll see.
oh, that's... that's right!
andrew detmer!
i remember you from homeroom,
freshman year.
you always had that
gray zip-up hoodie.
garetty!
you remember that?
yeah, i got a... i got a thing for faces,
which is why i'm going into politics.
ironically enough,
'cause i'm so ridiculously hi...
down here!
ah, there we go.
garetty, what's up?
i see you! matt!
you see me?
yeah, where did everybody go?
they left! they left! come on.
let's go, let's go, let's go!

yes. did you tell andrew?
andrew, it's making that sound, dude.
dude, come and listen to this.
listen to this.
no, no, no, no.
you gotta get in. okay, okay.
you gotta get close, like literally almost in the hole.
okay, don't push me. just don't push me.
check this shit out. we're not gonna push you in.
we're just trying to get it on camera.
listen. can you hear that?
shh, shh.
what...
i think we got it.
wait. how creepy is that?
is this sound coming up? i don't know.
i mean, probably. it's pretty loud, right?
hello! all right, dude.
we're going inside.
i'm going back. come on, you guys.
i gotta know.
matt, seriously,

hello?
andrew's such a pussy. all right.
does it go down much deeper, or what?
- yeah, man. it goes really, really far.
- andrew, bring the light.
look at the walls.
it's like a straight shot down.
probably already come
like 40 or 50 feet.
yeah, just don't
talk about it, okay?
you ever... you ever heard of
plato's “allegory of the cave”?
i don't know, matt.
let's just get this over with.
oh, shit!
holy shit.

matt, i'm not kidding.
i can't breathe.

matt.
what am i looking at?
ah, shit! i am
freaking out right now!
matt!

on the camera like that?
i don't know, man.

matt!
matt, look at this!

that's what i'm doing.
look. that's what i'm doing.
- i can't do it, dude.
- i give up.
you do it.
you're better at this than i am.
oh, really? am i?

oh, no!
come on, dude.
that is not cool.
what?
that is not cool.
my legos.
<i>you've been hanging out with
those two guys for the last three weeks.</i>
“three weeks.”
<i>i'm not stupid.</i>
<i>i think you're hiding something from me.
you better call me back.</i>
wow. i love you.
i'm gonna get a brick through my window.
i am legitimately scared.
i have an election coming up,
and i don't have time for this.
dude, why are you asking us
for advice on girls?
because we're his mistress.
so, what, you think it's,
like, radiation or something?
- radiation from what?
- dude, it's the government.
what?
matt, what are you talking about?
i'm feeling pretty
spelunked out actually.
andrew, relax.
that's so weird. it looks
completely different during the day.
look. i don't care, okay?
i am not going in the hole again.
asshole.
it's like sunk in or something.
there goes your old
camera, dude. oh, shit.
that's weird.
i can still feel it down there.
i can't believe
we made it out of there.
well, i mean, that answers that, right?
um, what does?
we still don't know what happened.
no well, we're still alive.
i mean, i was definitely hey!
you kids can't be here, okay?
you gotta move on out. what?
the ground's unstable.
we're taping the whole place off.
okay. we're going.
vote for steve!
new camera's
working out for you.
that's good. yeah,
it's pretty cool, right?
yeah, smaller.
does that shoot on tape?
no, it just... it, like,
records right onto the camera.
no, i just want to record all the
stuff that we can do, you know.
yeah, but it's like all the time.
you don't feel like
it's a little weird,
like it puts a barrier between
you and everything else?
uh, i don't know.
maybe i want a barrier.
so, like, what's up with your dad?
what's his story? what does he do?
um, my dad's a firefighter.
okay. that's cool. oh, man, that must have been awesome...
yeah, well, he was, i guess.
what happened? uh, i don't know.
he didn't die or anything.
he just... he got injured on
the job, and now he, um...
he collects the insurance,
you know.
um, so he doesn't
really do anything.
he just... he, um... he'll go out during
the day, but i don't know where he goes.
uh, he drinks a lot.
i know that much.
i've actually been having
some problems with my parents too.
oh, yeah?
yeah. i mean,
they're nothing like yours.
i mean, not like that...
i just... never mind.
they just been fighting a lot lately.
and i think my mom
is actually cheating on my dad.
can you not say
anything about that?
yeah. no way. thanks.
yes. karen detmer.
d-e-t-m-e-r.
yes. thank you.
she's in pain.
she needs something stronger.
her breathing's worse.
sir, she's suffering.
please help me.
i'm on disability.
i can't afford $700.
please, don't put me on hold! she can't breathe, okay?
i don't know what to do any more.
is it on?
yeah. yeah. you got it.
i want to remember you like this.
oh, mom.
you're stronger than this.
can you say that for me?
please?
i'm stronger than this.
oh, nice.
all right. here. watch this.
weak.
hey, matt.
yeah?
do you like me?
um, yeah, of course.
i mean, you know, i didn't...
i mean, you know, i didn't always.
what do you mean?
i don't know.
like, you haven't...
you haven't always been
super easy to talk to, you know.
i mean, i'm not saying that
you're not now. i'm just...
you're such an asshole.
that's what i'm talking about, dude.
you're hostile, see?
better.
hey, matt.
yeah?
do you ever think about, like,
doing more with it?
what, with this?
not really.
why? what else is there?
“telekinesis.”
yes. do tell.
“the ability to move, lift, vibrate”.
that's my favorite.
“spin, bend, break
or impact objects...
through the direct influence of mental
power or other nonphysical means.”.
okay.
sounds familiar.
it does sound familiar.
very familiar.
you want to see direct influence?
she's wearing black today.
hi.
that's direct influence.
...week, in my room.
just listen.
i'm just that much stronger. even last
night i got my whole bed off the ground.
no nosebleed. yeah?
i've been lifting weights too.
this is my theory though
is that it's like a muscle.
like, it's elastic. if you stretch
it too far, too quick, it'll tear.
ew.
that's why i think we're
getting stronger, you know,
because we're working it out,
getting buff.
buff.
how about this for a workout?
holy shit!
that was awesome.
classy.
mm-hmm.
attractive.
i think it's time we took this
out of the backyard.
stop, stop, stop, stop.
right here. this is perfect.
really? this is it.
matt. yah!
let's get this one.
whoa! hey! hello!
hey, what andrew.
help! somebody grab that!
whoa! whoa! stop!
- okay, i'll get the top.
- i'll get the top. got it. got it.
- let's get the legs.
- okay. wait.
i'm flying!
she's just looking at it.
what you looking at, girl?
stay in school!
okay, see the guy
chewing the gum?
i'm gonna get the gum and pull
it right out of his mouth.
okay, i got him.
oh!
wait, wait, wait, wait. why are we running?
we don't need to run.
five... i
don't want to do it.
four...
dude, i don't want to do it.
you're creating a scene. i don't want to do it.
come on, matt. don't be a bitch about it.
just do it.
put your hand on the table.
okay. are you ready? do it.
give me a countdown.
i will. i promi...
owh!
oh, snap!
like i said you
gotta pay for that now.
like i said. see?
holy crap.
man! just pretend that there's a
barrier over your hand, right? and then...
mm-hmm. when things are gonna
hit you, as long as you're ready,
- they will not hurt you because of the barrier.
- that's so sick.
that's me right there. i need that.
steve, steve, you have to try this, dude.
give me your hand.
when i was a kid though, i actually... i
actually did want to be a police officer.
a cop?
no shit? yeah. yeah.
you do know that you can't smoke
weed when you're a cop, right, matt?
oh, no. really?
uh, i didn't know.
uh, but, no, i... i... i just...
i really got into, like, altruism.
what does that mean?
what does “altruism” mean, matt?
it's like wanting to make things
better for everyone.
really? this coming from the man who is
always talking about how pointless life is.
yeah, i know, but this is what
i've been thinking about lately.
like, i'm looking back,
and i just think...
the way i used to think about things
was probably a lot better, you know.
so, what, you want to go out and
start a charity or something?
that's lame.
wait. why is that lame?
uh, i don't know.
douche bag.
i'm not good at everything.
i just do my best at everything.
all right?
that's what it's about.
i mean, you talk about philosophy
and shit all the time,
but what has he really done, hmm?
have you even applied
to colleges yet?
no, but i'm getting...
i'm getting to it.
yeah, well, you should get to it.
i'm just saying. i am.
you could use some of that.
you could use some “shut the hell up.”
how about that?
you just lack initiative. it's not
that big... oh, yeah? you lack a dick.
boys, please tell us
what's going on here.
uh, well, it would seem that a
virgin mary has appeared...
in the syrup
of a local man's pancake.
no, it has not.
uh, well, it will in a second, okay?
just hold on.
oh, that is definitely some
supernatural shit going on here.
um, excuse me.
can you come here real quick?
um, can you just look at that?
<i>ay, dios mio!</i>
grounder.
too much pressure.
andrew.
oh, dude. come on.
leave her alone.
oh, seriously?
dude!
oh, come on.
that is so messed up.
she's gonna get fired.
i didn't know...
that is disgusting.
but do you guys share cups on the team?
no, we don't share cups, man.
you see that car though?
the red one.
yeah.
all right.
the gum was cool.
all right. you tried.
it was a failed attempt though.
watch this.
what are you doing?
watch.
go, go, go.
what?
no way!
holy shit!
dude! holy crap!
what? what?
that's what i'm talking about!

- oh, man.
pause.

you guys, here she comes.
here she comes!
oh...
don't look.
don't look, don't look.
steve, don't look.
she can't find...
she thinks it's stolen.
she has no idea. yes,
it was the black guy this time.
“i could have sworn
i parked it right here. where is my car?"
ignore us.
we're just...
mormons.
what does that mean?
what does that mean?
uh-oh! uh-oh!
garetty's...
garetty's having a giggle fit.
that was
so... it was amazing.
i know. just take it easy
with the merchandise.
how did nobody see that?
it was out in the open.
her face!
i cannot get her face out of my mind!
that was awesome.
who is this?
so many ideas
of stuff that we can do!
go around.
that's just some redneck asshole.
go around. steve, steve, steve, steve.
take the camera. take the camera.

it's zoomed out all the way.

what the hell did you just do?
matt, stop the car! stop! stop!
are you crazy? pull down the road.
we gotta go down there right now.

what did you do?
why did you do that?
i didn't mean to.
i didn't...
shit! what the hell is wrong with you?
look at this!
will you just calm down!
the guy's probably still in there!
i'm sorry, okay?
andrew, stop, stop!
but i can... i can help!
i can get him out.

steve! steve!
steve, be careful!

through the guardrail. hey, is that on?
...this is a game or something? i don't
understand how you guys can be so angry.
you don't understand
how we can be angry?
andrew, you... you put somebody
in the hospital tonight, okay?
do you understand that?
andrew, look at me.
you put a guy in the hospital!
how do you feel about that?
you hurt somebody!
shit.
we need rules, okay?
no using it on living things.
you can't use it
when you're angry. that's it.
i don't think we should be
using it in public or
telling anybody about it.
look, you can't just declare rules, okay?
i will declare rules...
you're the one that said that nothing matters.
i will declare rules.
if we're gonna keep going, and we're
getting stronger, we need rules.
we need rules, right?
matt's right. we need rules.
andrew! answer the goddamn phone!
andrew!
matt, what did he say?
are you still mad at me?
no, i'm not mad.
well, you seem mad.
i'm not mad. i just...
i just think that we need to be more
careful now, you know? we can't...
we have to think a little bit more. we can't just do things.
we have to think first, okay?
i understand.
okay.
why is steve out in the boonies?
where are we?
steve?
his car's right there.
yeah.
steve, where you at?
steve!
“look up.”
hello, boys.

or you'll just flip yourself.
i got it. i got it.
come on, matt. come on.
all right.
oh, shit!
oh, man!
eating dirt, man.

i mean, i'm talking about
since the caveman times.
uh, the egyptians,
the wright brothers.
come here, matt. come here.
get in here. get in.
say it. “i can fly.”
i can fly.
i can fly!

andrew was just quicker.
how does that go again?
we almost died.
oh, please.
gestures...
how does she not notice though?
come on.
let's be serious, guys.
she definitely noticed
that it's gotten better.
you just gotta be, you know...
yeah?
you just gotta be subtle.
that is so cool.
dude. and i haven't
had sex since summer.
i haven't had sex since ever.
really?
really?
that is completely unacceptable.
well...
how are you guys so cool?
how are you guys so cool, man?
liquid nitrogen.
hey, guys?
guys? you guys up?
yeah.
hey, uh...
today was like...
it was like, i think,
the best day of my life.
like, i mean...
i'm thinking about it,
and i can't think of any day...
that i liked better
than today, you know?
i really... i think it was.
yeah.
unanimous.
yes.
okay. good.
okay, check this out.
say what you want,
but i'm thinking about booking it
to maui for the weekend.
what's up with that?
seriously?
well, we could do it. i mean,
i was thinking the same thing,
except i've always
wanted to go to tibet.
why tibet?
tibet?
yeah. i don't know.
it seems really beautiful,
you know, with all the...
will you shut up? shut...
the monuments and mountains, you know?
mm-hmm.
i don't know. and the monks have achieved
such a high level of enlightenment...
that they can, like,
float and shit, you know?
so we would fit right in. we could
really mess with their heads as well.
yeah, but, like, seriously,
i think we should go.
it would be really cool.
peaceful.
no, i think it's a really good idea.
i actually would like to go.
i'm down.
you down, steve?
what...
i... i don't know, man.
there's no bikinis in tibet.
so i don't know if i'm down with that.
it was brilliant. ch, it was so amazing.
she might have lost her job.
oh, shit, dude.
i got my mom's birthday. i gotta go.
it's aunt deb's birthday today?
yeah. i gotta go. i gotta go.
tell her i said hi.
later, matt.
all right, what do you want to do now?
where do you want to go?
i don't know. i mean,
i don't want to go home.
oh, do you want
to go into the city?
nah, it's rush hour, bro.
it's gonna be so much traffic. so what?
oh, yeah. that's right.
duh! let's go.
oh, hey. sorry, i just...
hi.
do you mind if i film you?
uh, a little bit. i don't really
like being on camera actually.
well, maybe it's,
like, exposure therapy.
yeah. no, i just came by
to give you something actually.
you did?
yeah.
what?
i was watching your, um...
your... your...
you know, your blog?
there's a drought
in the central african republic, right?
yeah. so i saw that and i thought it
seems pretty cool, and it's cheap too,
so i thought why not?
totally.
yeah.
yeah, i can tell that
you're really global and big picture,
concerned about that kind of stuff.
yeah.
you know, matt, you can
just mail this yourself.
i'm not your mom.
okay. i mean, i just...
what is this?
is this, like, the new you?
you got too smart to have fun
in eighth grade. so now what?
no.
casey, casey, casey,
casey, casey, casey.
listen, listen. can i
just talk to you for a second?
can i just tell you something?
mm-hmm.
i just... i... i...
i just want you to know
i'm not, you know, who i was... now.
you know, i'm cool.
i'm just...
you're cool?
high school popularity just seemed
like this weird backward contest,
and i thought since
i knew that, i could just...
that made you better
than everybody else.
no. no, no, no.
i know what you mean.
i would separate myself from that.
i get it.
you get it?
mm-hmm.
i know it sounds weird.
i just wanted you to know that.
to know that you're cool.
wow, i really screwed this up.
not as much as you might think.
really?
good-bye.
casey...
i gotta go. bye.
come on.
dude!
when did you start doing this?
like, since when?
what, with the camera?
yes, with the camera.
um...
i don't know. it's been
a little while, i guess.
see... oh.
i can't do that.
i can't do stuff
that requires finesse.
i tried to type my name out yesterday,
and i cracked my keyboard in half.
no, dude. it's really easy. you just...
you think that you're holding it.
see, that's what i'm talking
about right there. what?
you're always thinking up
new shit that we can do, man.
this is insane.
you know... i mean...
yeah.
yeah.
yeah. yes. i guess that i am.
whoo!
mom's, like, never home any more.
i mean, you saw
how my dad is. he's just... quiet.
sits around.
and it's pointless to talk to him about it
'cause he's got... nothing to say.
see, it's different,
'cause you've always had friends,
and people want to talk to you
and be around you.
i never had any of that.
i mean, before this,
i barely even hung out with
matt, and he's my cousin.
we were close
when we were little, but...
i don't know.
in high school, everything changed.
ever been to the space needle?
yep. when i was, like, five.
it's for tourists.
well, i don't know.
i mean, i went, um...
i think i was, like, seven...
with my dad one time and...
i don't know.
it was actually a really good day.
you remember that?
yeah.
actually, i do.
you know, i've been
meaning to ask you.
winter break is coming up.
you should do
the talent show with me.
no way.
why not? it'd be good for you
to get out there, you know.
meet some people, meet some girls.
dude, i'm not... it's just not...
what? look, i'm just
really shy, okay?
and i don't...
i don't even have any talents, so...
what are you talking about, you
don't have... you have talent.
you've got talent.
oh, dude, no way.
you look handsome.
thanks, yes. steve...
let me borrow some of his
clothes to make me look cool or whatever.
i'm glad you're spending
so much time with your friends.
yeah. yeah, me too.
hey. what?
how are you getting to school?
i don't know what you mean.
don't bullshit me, you idiot.
matt doesn't come.
he doesn't drive up.
you leave the house.
who the hell's giving you rides to school?
m... matt.
all right. you know what?
you're lying.
you're up to something,
and you can't hide it.
you think
you can just slink, hmm?
sneak in, sneak around
my house, smiling?
i'm onto your shit.
how do you
even work this stupid thing?
ah! and we're in business.
boo!
hey. hi.
um, what are you doing here?
i'm filming for the talent show.
matt garetty is filming for
the talent show. yes, i am.
wow.

newfound school spirit?

- being on camera?
- i actually don't mind being on camera.
- oh. here we go.
<i>ladies and gentlemen,
now coming to the stage...</i>

steve montgomery.

that's my boy. of course they went together.
what are you talking 'bout?
hey, andrew.
i hope you're seeing this.
congratulations, sir.
i just wanted you to know, dude...
i was really worried about you
before all this, you know?
but, dude, things are gonna get
so much better for you now.
i really, really feel that.
and i want you to know
i love you, you know?
i love you, man.
it's you and me.
it's detmer and garetty,
extended family for life.
oh, sorry. sorry. no, man.
excuse yourself.
oh, man.
when did i become the one who's out
here filming myself? hey, matt.
oh, hey. hey, casey.
so what are you filming?
uh, it's just a thing.
it's not like
eye of the storm or anything.
hey, i wanted to...
i wanted to tell you...
i've really been...
it's been making me think a lot.
i've been kind of
thinking about it in my...
no, i have. like, in my life.
i've been thinking, if i applied myself,
what i could do.
i could really...
i could change the world.
i mean, it's really been...
you're drunk.
what?
hey, casey?
i've basically been stalking you
since, like, sophomore year.
sorry, use of the word “stalking.”
i shouldn't have said...
you want to get out of here?
yeah.
yeah?
yes. yes, definitely.
uh, i... i have to drop off
the camera first though.
okay, you guys are getting ready
to witness history, all right?
i'm like a proud dad right now
because behind these doors,
andrew detmer becomes a man.
he's a little boy behind there.
he's scared.
he's like a butterfly,
getting ready to emerge...
oh, god!
from a cocoon or some shit like that.
disgusting weirdo!
wait. what happened?
ha-ha. okay...
is that...
out of my way now!
- oh, man.
- monica, what happened?
drew! drew! it's okay, man.
don't worry about it.
look, it happens to the
best of us, okay? dude!
you had
a little too much to drink...
you... oh. oh.
whoa, buddy.
the hell's going on, dude?
why are you laughing?
aw, man.
all over my jacket.
stop. stop laughing.
what are you talking about?
it's cool, man.
no, it's not cool, steve. stop.
stop what? it's cool, man.
will you just get out of here?
get out! what's your problem?
drew, drew!
you think this is funny?
no, i'm not laughing...
get out!
dad!
andrew! please!
i need my medicine.
mom's in pain, all right?
she needs her pills! where are you?
where are you?
dad!
hoarding a $500 camera while your mom dies in there?
i mean, how selfish can you be?
i went through your camera.
what did you see?
just you being a loser.
you think that those people
are your friends?
huh? they're not.
you're an embarrassment.
you're running around this town,
spending my money.
look at me
when i'm talking to you!
i didn't spend any
of your money, richard.
'cause i don't have
a dime to spend.
every last cent...
look at me!
every last cent goes to
school for you... school?
and medication for your mother.
i go to a public school!
i can't even pay for a goddamn... you don't
pay for a public school, you idiot!
what did you call me?
did you call me
an idiot, you shit?
did you call me an idiot? huh?
you piece of shit!
get up. i said get up!
get up!
i could crush you, you know that?
stop it!
crush you! get...
smile, matt.
oh, my god, matt. oh.
can we not do the camera thing
right now, please?
what happened?
uh... it just started
out of nowhere.
are you okay?
my head hurts really bad.
that's probably steve
calling your cell again.
i'll call him back later.
i think it's time to take...
matt! matt! come on! oh, wow.
i did not expect this.
give me my...
whoa!
hey! hey, asshole!
what are you doing up here?
just leave me alone, steve!
you can't be up here, dude.
this isn't safe.
i don't want to talk to anyone.
bro! what are you
doing up here?
leave me alone!
how did you find me?
i don't know, man.
my nose was bleeding.
i heard your voice
or something like...
what the hell
happened to your face?
nothing, man.
just leave me alone.
no, dude, that's not nothing.
that... your dad!
your dad beat the shit out of you.
he can't do that to you now.
will you stop acting
like you give a shit?
dude. why are you talking to me like this?
i'm your best friend.
i don't have any friends!
you were never my friend
before any of this.
i hang out with you and matt,
like, every day!
we're supposed to fly around the world together.
don't you... do you remember that?
you think i'm... stop!
just stop talking to me!
why won't you just leave me alone?
come on, man.
steve, i'm
telling you, get away from me!
get away from me now!
please!
...who, by the power of
god, are safeguarded in faith.
even though you do not see
him now,
you rejoice with an indescribable
and glorious joy...
as you attain the goal
of your faith...
the salvation of your soul.
what are you doing?
you filming graves?
i don't get it.
what do you care?
you haven't been returning my calls.
why aren't you returning my calls?
i've been busy.
no, you haven't.
why aren't you
returning my calls?
i just don't feel like talking.
turn off the camera.
no.
andrew.
andrew, turn off the camera.
andrew? how did he
get struck by lightning...
during a storm with no
recorded lightning strikes?
how?
and they found steve
out in the middle of a field.
why would steve go out in the middle of a
field during a lightning storm, andrew?
i don't know.
why? what?
i don't know
what happened, matt!
i don't believe you, okay?
i don't believe you.
i want you to turn off the
camera and talk to me. why?
'cause i want to have a conversation with you.
don't tell me what to do, matt.
you can't tell me what to do!
don't ever tell...
give me... shut it off!
get off of me!
andrew...
are you joking right now?
is this a joke to you? i...
what did you do, andrew?
what did you do?
who am i supposed
to tell about this?
who do i talk to?
who do i talk to about this?
why won't you just tell me
what happened, andrew?
please believe me, steve.
please, it's just i...
i don't know what i did. i...
i lost control, and...
and i'm so sorry.
this thing is just becoming
a part of me now,
and i don't...
i miss you, steve.
...all the drills. good.
we're all pretty good, right?
get ready. go!
you guys?
do not hesitate.
did you hear who worked?
he was like.
oh! oh, andrew!
dry off!
totally.
hey, wayne!
okay, so, see this one here?
this one i got really clean
'cause i did this little, like,
lasso thing around the root,
you know?
but then these two...
these, i did not get as good.
see how they're broken?
i think it's because i got them from the
middle, you know, instead of the root.
oh. oh.
oh. sloppy.
i've been doing a lot of reading,
you know, like, online about, like...
just like evolution
and, like... and natural selection...
and how, like,
there's this thing, right?
it is called the apex predator,
right?
and basically what this is is the
strongest animal in the ecosystem, right?
and as human beings,
we are... we're considered
the apex predator,
but only because, like, smaller
animals can't feed on us...
because of weapons
and stuff, right?
the lion does not feel guilty
when it kills a gazelle. right?
you do not feel guilty
when you squash a fly.
and i think
that means something.
i just think
that really means something.
<i>this one i got really
clean 'cause i did this little, like,</i>
<i>lasso thing.</i>
andrew,
what happened at school? huh?
i need to go and pick up my
mom's medication! oh, yeah?
you're gonna break the rules again?
we're too strong for that now, andrew!
if you did that, you know what i'd have to do!
you'd have to what?
you have to start thinking.
what would you have to do, matt?
there are consequences
to what you do!
you could not do anything to me because i
am stronger than you. stop that bullshit!
i know what you did. i'm not
gonna let you do it again!
i am not going to break
your stupid rules!
okay? so just screw off
and stay out of my life!
i can't breathe.
thank you.
karen detmer.
just one moment.
we're gonna need
a next... day delivery.
co-pay on that is $750.83.
well, i don't have all that.

you can pay up front, and we
can order next... day delivery.

broke-ass backpack on.

while i was out looking for you.
