the women's evolution

they think you 're crazy 
and should be in a mental hospital ...
you finally receive 
both recognition.
it takes so long 
to take us seriously .

do not touch anything. anyway .
it was a long way .

of the program . it's amazing .

ladies and gentlemen , 
do not run . thank you .
i could not pass you .
mom dressed me as satan 
when i was four ...
to my first party.
everyone seemed happy 
how princesses and cowboys.
and i felt so miserable .
a child with a black dress 
sad satan and two horns .
i do not know why 
so she dressed me .
i think it marked my life . 
we're recreating that image.
look at me .
sixty years later .
after the screening , i have to give 
more attention to my sex life .
i have to take care of it . 
if i put a photo like this ...
do you think it will attract 
some men ?
semi - intellectual artist, on top 
career singles looking .
you are seeing several 
marinas basically.
you see a marina ...
what is product 
partisan parents ...
two national heroes , 
without limits , determined ...
grasping what is 
in front of her .
and near this 
marina there is another ...
a child ...
whose mother never gave love 
enough , very vulnerable ...
and unbelievably 
disappointed and sad.
and there is another that has 
a certain spiritual wisdom ...
and can be 
above it all .
and this is my favorite .
six months ago 
display at moma
this side of the line .
we have to do there ... 
it's there .
we can ...
we have to start now .
- i think so ... 
- this is the coolest .
and then as well .
here we already have 10 pieces . 
what is enough.
yes , if they are well .
i love his name , august . 
do you have a brother in september ?
who will write the texts ?
- will klaus and his team . 
- will klaus ?
- very well, then ... 
- i just will put them on the wall .
good to know . 
taste of times font .
- pleasure to meet you . 
- the type of letter.
and like the russian font . 
but we can choose together.
- okay . 
- great . thank you.
it is very red.
yesterday we talked about letting them 
in black and white .
there will be color actually .
at least once , 
i wanted to show everything.
what is making art 
be an artist .
the both of correspondence, 
e-mails , faxes , letters ...
both the ticket 
air and all the rest .
the structure is huge . 
show physical labor ...
that has nothing to do 
with creativity ...
just administration.
office 
marina abramovic .
i will have six 
floors of moma .
- what is a big deal . 
- it's unbelievable .
i already feel back pain 
just thinking about it .
be chronological . this is the beginning . 
my early work .
this work is called 
the artist is present ...
based on performances 
where the artist is present .
it does not include my objects 
transient sound pieces ...
objects with crystals . 
only performance . pure performance .
everything is performance . 
if we have images ...
do not show anything but 
the images. it is very radical.
therefore , this view at moma 
is historical and important to me .
it put things 
in the right places ...
performance because it never was 
a common art form .
it is an alternative 
since i was born .
want it to be a form 
art and respect .
before i die .
you too . kiss.
let's start 
with the display .
you will reinterpret 
his performances ?
- no, i will make a new piece . 
- one or several ?
only one new piece . 
the artist is present .
the other people are ...
reinterpreting 
my five historic pieces .
i think his first performance was 
a museum in belgrade .
this is ...
what kind of places ...
marina , the sound is an inherent element 
in relation in movement ...
where you drive a van 
a square for 16 hours ...
while yelling numbers 
a megaphone.
you replaced your persona 
by a prostitute .
in rhythm 2 , 
you took psychoactive drugs ...
to challenge 
social behavior ...
about women 
with mental illness .
rhythm and five , you lay ...
inside a star 
wood burning ...
and fainted for lack 
of oxygen .
you have put your body 
in danger in these works ...
and you must be tired 
of these questions ...
but i want to talk about it 
before proceeding .
there is only one question 
i have not heard for 10 years ...
\" why is this art? \"
always ask me 
when it started ...
and i could not tolerate . 
now i miss the question.
nobody asks me that anymore . 
maybe because of my age .
finally understood 
understood or pretend to have .
if you are an alternative artist 
at 18, 19 , 20 years ...
and remains alternative 
at 29 and 30 years ...
and remains alternative 
also at 40 and 50 years ...
but i have 63 years . 
do not wanna be an alternative .
many people think it 
as the grandmother of performance art .
the art has to be beautiful . 
the artist must be beautiful .
performance art 
emerged in the 60s ...
as a challenge to paint .
it was not something 
hung on the wall.
it is an art form 
where the object is the body .
in the case of marina , 
she uses the human body ...
to express opinions 
that can be violent ...
or provocative .
it challenges the audience 
directly and boldly .
the essence of her work ...
is sharing 
the experience ...
between the audience and the artist .
many of the works 
marina are interventions .
like when she did rhythm 0 
naples , with objects ...
and people could 
use them against her.
that's how 
stanford experiment , right?
it's a science experiment 
that reveals human nature .
but what is art , but the revelation 
human nature ?
it seems a mystery crime . 
like hitchcock .
she will be murdered ? 
here 's the gun .
what will happen ? 
who comes and who goes ?
the veneer of civilization 
is very thin .
and it's amazing 
how quickly ...
a group of people 
becomes animalistic ...
if you give him 
such permission .
some of the performances 
initials of marina ...
were about it .
by playing 
with the knife ...
marina creates the intensity 
of her performances ...
which makes 
transcendental .
marina chose
to reinterpret 
five of their historical pieces in moma .
she invited for a workshop 
at her home in hudson valley .
the workshop 
is called \"clearing house \" ...
to prepare 
for display at moma .
let's cut together . 
and fast.
we have to cut all this 
and put into soup before 14h .
my generation of artists 
no longer acts .
i am one of the two 
or three others.
and i thought : 
\" it is my duty to make history ? \"
so when i was invited 
to make a display at moma ...
thought important 
for me and my ego ...
give five historical pieces ...
for young artists 
reinterpret .
they are coming 
and i 'm making soup .
she said that we will not 
eat or talk for three days .
that we hate it 's time ...
but then we love her 
and do what she wants .
why do you look 
worried?
she wants us to stay 
fasting for three days ...
and said we will do 
exercises .
i believe in my instinct 
and think it is right to trust her .
make your last 
telephone calls .
you will be free 
three days. that's incredible.
what will happen ?
- we 'll tell you later . 
- it does not matter .
this will be different.
they can use that experience 
and then do whatever they want .
but it is likely that they hate me . 
at least at the beginning .
it is a simple structure , 
and the idea is to control your body ...
and control your mind ...
in zero gravity 
if possible .
the first ritual is to wake up 
and do simple exercises ...
eg , skip 
and release some energy .
i will show you . it's simple . 
after going to the river .
if anyone has trouble 
nude ...
bring a swimsuit, 
bikini, swimsuit , you want ...
or go naked , do not care .
we do this because they 
have to work three months ...
what a great 
type of obligation .
they have to create your own 
charismatic space ...
and for that, we have 
to consider some training .
the purpose 
is empty ourselves .
being able to be 
at the present time .
put our minds 
the here and now .
then something appears emotional . 
it's what we want this work .
performance is in need 
an emotional outlet.
it is a kind of direct dialogue 
between the audience and the artist .
and if you are this 100 % 
during the performance ...
emotional moment 
come for everyone.
there is no escape . 
everyone feels it .
artists have 
to be warriors ...
must be specified 
and have energy to conquer ...
not only new territory , 
but themselves ...
and weaknesses.
no matter what job 
that makes as an artist ...
the most important is the state 
mental that you realize .
performance is a 
matter of mental state .
so ...
wait and see.
marina abramovic : 
the artist is present ...
mean of 9 
march to may 31 ...
whenever you 
enter the museum ...
can be at nine thirty 
morning or afternoon at five ...
she will be present .
just as i thought the artist 
gift is a salon?
like a movie set .
there is a square 
huge light.
only the square , as in the movie 
lost in translation .
in the middle of the square , 
there is a table and two chairs .
it's simple , it's like not 
there was nothing .
only the artist sitting . 
i want to be there like a stone .
only three months .
and look in his eyes .
will be three months . 
everyday.
if you work three months 
performance becomes reality.
no one understands that more difficult 
is doing something that is almost nothing .
this requires 100 % of you 
no more story to tell ...
there are no objects behind which 
hide. there is nothing .
it is their sheer presence , you just 
have your energy and nothing else .
seven and a half hours , 
six days a week.
without moving.
i have nothing to say.
no comments . 
just respect.
i find unbearable 
sit without moving.
she tries .
do not know if will work .
can i show you ?
when she had this idea 
thought : \" she's going to kill. \"
i said : \" marina , do not know 
if you want the responsibility ...
give you permission 
to do this .
think about it a couple of days . \"
she called me the next day 
and said, \" i can do that . \"
once klaus biesenbach 
created the name of the show ...
the artist is present , 
was as a destination .
liked at the time . the artist 
is present , can not escape .
look. this is not fantastic ?
- it is aesthetic . 
- no one will see it .
there will be 
the flood museum.
maybe i will not use it .
i am telling you 
never use . you promised .
well , this is a 
security issue ...
men do not understand . 
i think that is good.
he did not want to deal 
with reality .
it fits well. i think it was 
a brilliant solution .
i do not know why i have to do 
increasingly difficult.
i could have done 
a retrospective .
thirty- six people 
reinterpreting my pieces .
a dinner to celebrate 
go home and the job was done .
why must i do this ? 
it seems the cross i bear.
it's crazy . god 
help me take it to the end .
when you watch one 
performance of marina abramovic ...
you are engaged 
in the physical presence of her ...
that is impressive.
the evidence of the tremendous force 
and physical energy it ...
that the presence 
of the public gives you ...
is clearly innate .
she can sit still, 
or do very little ...
or what she is doing 
in performance for long.
most people 
fail .
my parents are heroes 
national the time of tito ...
during the second 
war in the former yugoslavia .
had much control 
in my house , which i hated .
everything was disciplined, 
with time .
i was trained 
to be a soldier .
mom woke me up 
in the night ...
i was asleep 
in a rumpled bed .
that was kind of crazy. 
there was no love .
i do not remember mom 
kissing me or hugging .
later, when she asked : 
\" why would you ever kiss me? \"
she was surprised and said ...
\" of course not , 
i do not want to spoil it . \"
she not spoiled me , 
but i had a loving grandmother ...
present, religious , 
passed all the time in church .
i spent much time with her ...
because my parents were political , 
had no time for me .
there is a strange mixture ...
between religiosity 
and that communist discipline.
today i see it 
was important to me ...
it made me 
who i am.
three months before 
display at moma
florence , italy
- nice to meet you . 
- welcome to florence .
thank you.
i had to go to the bathroom 
at the airport ...
and made ​​a discovery 
fantastic .
two pages with illustrations . 
\" how to wash your hands ...
with soap and water . \"
brilliant.
we are here today ...
for the delivery of important 
lorenzo magnifico award ...
marina abramovic .
thank you.
i need the microphone ?
i thought i'd 
lecture in the end ...
but do not think this 
is the occasion to lecture.
i'd rather have a dialogue 
with the public .
before that , i read 
my manifesto for you .
i wrote my manifesto 
heart .
he is also funny, 
at the same time.
but it's true .
\" an artist should not lie 
to himself or others.
an artist should not steal 
ideas from another artist.
an artist should not 
to commit himself ...
or the art market .
an artist should not 
kill another human being .
an artist should not 
do idol .
an artist is related . 
to your love life \"
no, love life .
loving .
\" an artist should avoid 
fall in love with another artist .
an artist should avoid 
fall in love with another artist .
an artist should avoid . 
fall in love with another artist \"
we met 
when she came to amsterdam .
she was going to perform.
i met her before and thought ...
the exhibition was called 
thomas lips .
during the performance ...
she made a pentagram 
belly with a razor ...
and whipped .
i thought, \" maybe not . \"
then i started 
to notice the wounds .
do not licked , but took care 
and cleaned the wounds ...
put something in them , and i think 
that was the crux .
when we met 
there was an immediate fascination.
by type , character 
personality ...
the work we did 
individually.
it was as if we had found 
lost a brother or sister.
it was something.
and born on the same day ,
obviously .
fate brought us together .
i loved him very much . 
more than myself .
for me , when we started 
working together, it was forever.
i thought that relationship 
and work and never would end .
were two conjoined twins 
the body and soul .
were lovers , we were 
friends were artists ...
all at the same time.
and our love was 
always above that.
the relationship of marina and ulay 
is a great love story .
marina has no limits ...
and met someone who 
was prepared for all the art .
that must have impressed her 
because she met her partner.
when marina and ulay started 
the workgroup ...
known 
as relation works ...
nothing like it had been 
made ​​until then.
our bodies were 
of confrontational way ...
because we wanted to show 
the man / woman conflict ...
traumatic experiences 
about relationships .
we filled 
purple marks at the time.
but it did not hurt .
our 12 years have been so 
intense , heavy and powerful ...
as a lifetime 
other people 's .
we passed through several stages . 
falling in love, stay together 12 years .
for the first time 
in 23 years ...
we get 
under the same roof .
ulay arrive at 14h . 
this is the first time ...
ulay who comes to this 
apartment in new york .
he never came here 
or the other.
they are separated for years . 
come join us to talk about it .
i do not know what will happen , 
but it will be interesting.
for sure .
- how will 
- i'm fine.
i just get the analyst.
dr. glimour . 
a special lady .
very strict . 
taste of rigor .
by bit 
she does not wear uniform.
she told me i'm not 
so badly emotionally ...
and that i should explore 
more my childhood ...
and not repeat the same patterns 
next relationship.
i told him about ulay and she thinks 
that the meeting can be easy ...
or not . we do not know . 
let me take a glass - d ?? water.
both are in the third 
act of our lives .
there is no other moment 
to approach ...
and forgive us.
and peacefully understand 
that was terrible ...
painful and hateful 
when we were together ...
but was creative while 
and we must forgive ourselves .
you're in the wrong building ?
- the performing garage is here. 
- this is my building .
hello , dear .
how should i call it ? grandma 
diva or performance art ?
come in.
i think i still love her . 
i can live with that .
i'm happy. 
it's better than hate her .
here is my loft . 
you know davide ?
- that nothing . 
- my assistant .
- hello , davide . 
- did you ever know .
i saw him in the office , right?
- it is you who sends the emails . 
- am .
davide is a young artist . 
and the good . he is turin .
- david- ê 
- not david . it is davide .
- how are you going ? 
- i'm fine . look at me .
certainly .
if i can help , 
will be a pleasure .
if i can do something 
for her , will be a pleasure .
depends on what , 
but for now , yes, of course .
i can only do two things . 
helping or be good .
it's an amazing apartment . 
you are always here , davide ?
yes , almost always .
i try to do the same . 
here is great .
maybe she still 
love me. i do not know .
tomorrow we'll find out . 
tomorrow or later.
and maybe i \" put a 
finger in her tooth.\"
- put a finger in her tooth ? 
- this means doing something sensible .
reaching the limit
marina , you're nervous 
with the exhibition at moma ?
very . i'm nervous up 
to make speech.
- fico days in the bathroom . 
- okay .
if i'm not nervous , 
i get so nervous .
you will move 
a bit in the chair ...
going to and fro 
or will be in the same position ?
in the same position . 
i'm not moving .
where will you look ?
for those who sit 
in front of me .
there will be a chair 
in front of you ?
yes , one can 
as you want to sit .
in front .
there will be 11-15 thousand people 
moma . will only stare.
marina seduces everyone you know . 
is not the case with me ...
because i've been through this process 
and now we are divorced .
we are great friends , 
but divorced .
he would never try to seduce me 
because we are divorced .
with marina , always try 
to separate the artist from the person ...
with whom i relate 
professionally.
i try to deal with it 
as if it were a sculpture .
i see her work 
as an object .
i try to be objective with it ...
because they do not want 
the artist interfere .
because marina 
never stops acting .
marina , you do not 
need this ?
are you sure ?
he makes the wine disappear .
i can teach her how to do 
this is fun.
i just met someone ...
they thought i should 
really know ...
and it happened at moma . 
so we came here , we drink ...
and he is a guy 
interesting.
he is a magician . 
david blaine .
he thinks he can do something 
during my exhibition at moma .
knows the axes behind glass 
in case of emergency?
i thought about using one 
substance that she has ...
and choke her with it . people 
would find it very strange .
then , break the glass , take 
the ax and start cutting it .
then the ambulance arrives ...
they put a 
covered about me ...
there's blood everywhere . 
and the police arrive and arrest him .
she is lying there 
and that's the end of the exhibition .
and people do not know 
it was an accident .
questioning 
if it is real or not .
- and i will strike violently . 
- have you done this ?
if i do this two times 
, is an illusion .
but when you do it 
since it is madness .
fantastic marina 
is that it will be at moma .
that is the public 
perfect for this.
certainly .
- what do you think ? 
- i think it's a bad idea .
why ?
it is an interesting subject 
and does amazing things ...
but culturally 
some people ...
call people 
so magical ...
it should rather be 
called illusionist ...
and that says it all .
his work has nothing 
to do with illusionism .
he is real. and make the connection 
between these works at the moma ...
the more important exhibition 
you have done in your career ...
would be a disaster . i think 
that is the wrong thing to do .
i oppose with all 
my being . how about this ?
done ! you are right . 
i accept .
- done . 
- thank you.
we work with nine galleries . 
marina and now is a giant .
but sean has supported us ...
when nobody wanted to 
deal with problems ...
to have a performance artist 
in the context of a gallery .
answer me .
among blue ...
and red, 
which do you prefer?
- what is your first instinct ? 
- red .
klaus chose blue , 
but all want the red.
performances by nature 
are ephemeral .
then carefully 
select a photo ...
to represent 
each performance ...
and transform 
in books and sell them.
this is fantastic .
we had minor issues .
that was 20 years ago ...
and sell for two 
to five thousand dollars each .
and now they are highly sought 
and if you can find them ...
they are worth between 25 
and $ 50,000 each .
there is a drama in these photos .
the model we created for marina 
and how it created the market ...
has become a standard 
observed by others.
so that's it .
art is easy
in the 70s , with ulay , 
took the radical decision ...
living in a car.
not needed to pay 
phone bills ...
light rental . 
and we had no money .
we did not want to do 
anything besides acting .
igor , this is the van where i lived . 
i lived in it so long ...
and two days ago you said 
she is beautiful .
and i said, \" linda in a museum , 
but it was a hard life ...
i had nothing . 
lovely \" let's go .
it had been over 30 years 
i did not see that car .
and when i saw him at the museum , 
i had an unexpected feeling .
it was like a past life 
come to meet me .
we live in the countryside with shepherds , 
we took milk of goats .
we were going with empty bottle 
mineral water ...
borrow petrol 
the posts .
i knew all the showers 
and gas stations in europe .
this van drives me 
thrilled .
gee , i heart 
party to look the van .
i remember how there was so much belief 
hope and innocence ...
in our life at that time .
it was a very happy time 
in my life right car.
i had everything i ever wanted . 
the man i loved ...
working together , 
being radicals ...
and without words 
no commitment .
there were two of us 
the dog and the universe .
i see that way 
amazing from there to here .
it's a long way .
i have to prepare the display . 
no time .
marina knitting 
sweaters for us .
i repaired and always ran 
the car . marina did not drive .
we had only the basics . 
we were like modern nomads .
but it was the best time . 
we had a lot of energy and power.
here is the hudson river?
here is hudson. go ahead . 
red light , stop .
green light , go .
let's stop here 
because i want to drive now .
it is my historic moment .
'll drive for you 
the first time in life.
i am willing 
to sit beside her .
ulay .
never thought 
would reach it . never .
- the lighthouse is lit ? 
- right .
- nope. lighthouse is lit 
- yes , it is.
- that's great . 
- i had already called the lighthouse .
the handbrake 
is down ?
he was pulled . 
not now .
i knew there was something 
wrong.
let's stroll . you're 
in my hands now .
it was what i feared.
turn right most . 
a little more . stop .
go, go . is perfect.
go ahead .
only one meter, 
or pass through the door .
well , i'm 
a little nervous ...
but surprised .
from one to 10 , ulay , 
what do you think ? five ?
- more . 
- six ?
more.
- okay, seven and a half . 
- no seven .
seven is a good number .
great .
very well .
abramovic . 
you work hard .
- i only know how to do that. 
- it is true .
i will make zucchini sauce 
pasta with this .
our relationship 
was based on tasks ...
of man and woman. 
he did everything in the outside world ...
took loans 
money was going to the bank .
and i cleaned , washed 
and took care of the dog.
when we parted , 
i had no bank account .
i did not know 
how it worked .
it took me a while to 
learn everything from scratch .
you have opener ?
after our simple life 
she became too ambitious .
both at work 
as in life itself ...
with respect 
the image and wealth.
and i kept more in line 
stable , straight after the split .
she climbed a 
huge mountain ...
with much success .
this may be weird , but not 
have time to push myself ...
to make it 
possible for me .
but no need to do this , 
i'll marry her .
okay if i do 
the food a bit spicy ?
pepperoncini ?
i believe there are not many 
artists working both ...
as marina .
but she is always 
very elegant .
i look like a 
field worker .
i am a worker 
in art .
i look like a worker, 
but much less work .
well , you know 
what i mean .
'm lazy .
the nightsea crossing is 
a man and a woman ...
sitting in front 
of each other in chairs .
sitting without moving, 
silent ...
and fast.
this portrays what is despised 
in western society .
inactivity, lack of action 
silence are discredited ...
fasting is discredited .
these three things 
irritated people ...
especially when it lasted 
four, five , six, seven ...
eight, nine , ten, eleven , twelve 
thirteen , fourteen, fifteen ...
sixteen days .
inactivity, silence , fasting , 
absolutely still ...
which is almost impossible.
we did nightsea crossing 
for 90 non-consecutive days .
once i got up .
not take it anymore .
a woman sits better 
than the man ...
because of the anatomy . 
i gave up after 13 or 14 days .
my ribs were 
pushing so hard my spleen ...
they said at the hospital : 
\" you should stop fasting . \"
i had already lost 10kg .
this was beyond the bounds 
on my part .
once .
he could not sit 
because he was so skinny ...
bones 
penetrated his skin .
yogis do the same . 
but he did not .
then he said : 
\" you have to get up ...
it might not make 
it without me . \"
and i saw no reason for that.
so keep doing 
the nightsea crossing.
still , 
but with the empty chair .
never had a relationship 
with a woman , or man ...
with such a degree 
symbiotic quality.
twelve years have left us 
exhausted .
the marina - ulay , collaboration 
in a simple, direct ...
and deep , expressing 
dynamic man / woman ...
and reaches a 
epic conclusion ...
to walk on the wall 
china called the lovers .
she goes beyond what is 
extravagant in proportion .
the lovers , where marina and ulay 
walked in wall of china ...
was an epic .
the process of three months 
walking toward each other ...
was very simple , without exaggeration 
and extraordinarily clear .
this was the last work 
them in relation works .
and walk in wall of china 
ended with their separation .
soon became 
a great couple of artists ...
and all projected 
a perfect image .
actually , 
he was not happy ...
and as they were better 
our work ...
was our worst 
private relationship.
and then , his interests 
were different from mine ...
and he was experiencing 
life , drinking , using drugs .
then he became unfaithful , 
which was very difficult for me .
we were monogamous 
to a point .
when the rigor of that ideology 
began to unravel ...
started ...
to disintegrate .
then , at the time, she had a 
sexual adventure with someone ...
as i had .
at the same time . except she 
chose a friend of ours . i did not .
i should not have said that .
it took us eight years 
trading permission ...
to walk 
in wall of china ...
and he had to go to china several 
times . she was the translator.
when finished with the wall , 
he told me she was pregnant .
e asked : 
\" what do i do ? \"
i said, \" what do you do ?
i'm leaving and you 
do what you want . \"
then they got married.
it was like the beginning . 
ended as it began .
started quickly 
and ended quickly .
was well .
after i separated 
of ulay ...
lived more time 
dramatic of my life .
i wrote in my diary : 
\" i'm 40 , overweight ...
ugly and undesirable . \"
i thought, \" god , i lost the man 
i love and my work . \"
we worked together. 
there was nothing . he was empty .
and it would be a new beginning ...
or i would destroy me 
with depression .
it was the first time i received 
a penny in paris ...
and bought clothing couture . 
i felt great .
i went to the hairdresser , did pedicure 
manicure. it was great .
what is the price of this jacket ? 
he is priceless .
- you can not pay for it . 
- price .
the price of couture 
starts at eight thousand ...
and can reach 
depends on the parts .
i did it all to 
right and i was fine.
why not feel good 
and desired again?
and since 
i started worshiping fashion .
it was like a secret desire .
that is beautiful . 
what do you think ?
being a performance artist 
in the 70 , 80 was to be poor .
point . end point .
goodbye ...
extremes.
after we parted , 
she was working in theater .
there was money in it .
goodbye ...
ulay .
the new jobs have it 
a very formalist aesthetics.
she had entered 
in the theater world .
everything was on stage .
with a theatrical flair .
marina is an artist 
more theatrical, emotional ...
much more dramatic ...
than this display shows .
the only risk 
exhibit at moma ...
how theatrical she will 
be able to .
marina always say 
there is a difference .
in performance , 
there is a knife and the blood is your own.
when you enacts , 
is ketchup and you do not cut yourself .
if we lose this 
view in the moma ...
if it is only a fake knife 
and ketchup , then fail .
two weeks before 
display at moma
i'm in bed for six days .
only bed .
damn, damn, damn . 
do not get out of bed for six days.
i was so desperate 
i took everything they gave me.
then i discovered that this syrup 
have codeine. he's incredible .
never use drugs , 
but the codeine makes us happy.
i slept like a baby all night 
yesterday with a smile .
like an idiot .
and here i am .
red is good 
because it gives us strength.
so if i have everything red 
linens , scarf , pajamas , oranges ...
maybe i will get well soon .
this was my monologue .
five days before 
display at moma
- how do you feel today ? 
- i feel really bad .
i'm terrified . 
nothing .
we are all getting ready . 
marina can see a projection ?
let me see a projection . 
any.
we have no electricity . 
there's no way to connect the devices .
nor have projectors . 
sorry . not yet .
there is nothing ! nothing !
five days before display 
and it seems that there will be no display .
what makes me most 
is nervous that room .
the walls 
are not in place.
we can start the test ? 
this is important .
we can get them there ? 
come .
how are you ?
as well .
come .
let us sit two 
seconds. i want to see everyone.
this is so different 
our workshop in the field.
this is hell. and it is important to 
be honest about all this ...
because i can not pretend 
i'm calm . i'm not .
and did not even have contact 
staff with any of you.
i have to trust 
my life to you ...
within three months of the exhibition . 
there is no other way .
because i have to ...
i need my energy 
to do my part ...
knowing that is 
that's fine with the rest .
thanks for coming 
moma tonight .
i am the curator of the retrospective 
marina abramovic .
and i'd like 
to present marina .
thank you, marina .
let's open mic 
for questions .
it's the last chance to ask 
something to her directly ...
or will have to wait until june .
it's so late , we hear 
three good questions .
- and at least one personal . 
- how would we know that?
question guys. 
you look happy . you ?
it depends .
what can i say ? 
i am very happy ...
because i'm alone . 
with whom i could live ...
and do it for three months ? 
no stay with me .
i am living 
as a military training ...
i am fully concentrated 
this work three months .
sounds simple , 
i 'm in the lounge ...
a sitting position . 
not so .
it's very difficult because you 
have to be like a stone .
i want to create a stillness 
in the middle of hell .
thank you.
thank you.
let's go .
thank you .
thank you.
okay ?
wait .
wow !
i do not know .
today ?
it's nothing.
the difference is that there is 
a blockage between them ...
from the viewpoint 
security.
if someone does something ...
there is nothing preventing 
someone to do something .
that's what i think . 
but instruct the public ...
which to sit , no one can 
move, tap on it , nothing .
she becomes more vulnerable . 
it is much more straightforward.
there is no obstacle between it 
and the public . she was right .
fathers do not need the cross.
may
nine , december
three , two, one .
- show me your numbers . 
- what's that ?
this is the number system 
marina abramovic .
- we're almost done . 
- you said that in april too.
this is detail . do not 
can grab a few minutes here and there .
a few minutes ?
what's more 
a month, year , or week.
you rascal !
- do not cling to ... 
- details .
- think big . 
- yes , think big .
that's it.
- i'm fine . 
- okay ?
the museum is open . 
come on, please! come on !
- i'm number five . 
- she's five , i 'm four .
one, two ...
three .
stood in line several days 
and could not enter.
you stood in queue ? when?
i arrived yesterday at 5pm , 
but i could not .
it is very ...
now in the end 
is very competitive .
people camp 
all night and expect.
it reminds me 
the issue of celebrity ...
star performance .
it is a matter of fans .
what is very interesting 
in her work ...
is the aspect of screen 
blank .
what causes in all 
in the art world ...
those who say 
know the work very well ...
forming part of 
vocabulary of the language ...
and strangers too .
people who ask : 
\" why does she do that? \"
and this is interesting because 
we also ...
these giant screens 
projections .
connecting marina 
with the public ...
comes this emptiness she feels , 
or felt as a child .
she wants to be loved , 
be needed .
marina has the feel ...
you need the public ...
like the air to breathe .
that's the fuel it.
she lives for her art , 
to the public.
when i met her ...
i thought , \"wow , she is 
in love with me . \"
and it took me a while ...
to understand that she is 
in love with the world.
it is not personal .
\"i do not think it's personal 
'm in love with the world ...
not only for you. \"
i realized she 
is repeating it ...
with each 
of the people in the hall .
all right , mom?
- what happened 
- i'm well proud of you .
i do not know if the public 
idolizes me .
belongs to him how to design it , 
but it's not my goal .
if you get a 
point of his career ...
who is idolized , 
has money and fame ...
this is not the goal of art , 
is only a side effect .
it is an extra product . 
and i love the extra product.
there are people around, 
you know it ...
but the connection with marina 
is so strong it does not matter.
- erases all the rest . 
- she is acting ?
if you say no . 
who is acting ...
the only similarity is 
that there are people watching .
the sacrifice 
a performance ...
seems always to 
based on performance .
- maybe . 
- are you an actor ?
do you feel this presence .
attention, please. 
the museum is closed .
please return units 
audio reception.
tunji knew told me ...
that 750 000 people 
saw the display ?
it's almost a million .
we must extend one more 
month terms to one million .
let's go . that's the cook ?
he is a genius .
who was that 
asian ?
you like it?
we can take 
the phone number ?
he was cool. sexy .
we're almost done .
after seeing the exhibition 
marina for the first time ...
i was inspired to do 
my own art performance .
create one . staying here 
is a presentation ...
devote so much 
commitment to it .
the last day
got there .
almost there .
next saturday i will be 
in the field. what will be too .
i wanted to have a number, 
but i'm not .
came from australia to 
sit with marina .
it takes number ?
i am sad and happy .
marina , we are going 
on the street for 53 you see the queue ...
the last time.
they arrived on wednesday 
or thursday night .
one girl had the idea 
come around 22h .
wow !
and from then on , 
people do not go away .
they are seated .
leave the museum and sit 
on the door until morning .
my god , this is amazing . 
this is the last day .
i guess nobody 
imagined it .
what time is it ?
are 10h13 . ten and fifteen .
- we go to the chairs ? 
- sure .
already planned . 
i know what to do .
we will do intervals 
you tap on the shoulder of the person 
and says the time is up .
the museum only opens at 10:30 am ...
but let
who will not sit 
marina before ...
not one now. 
wait until the museum open .
sitting with marina
you expect 
become ?
no, when i first 
time , i decided to try ...
and then it happened.
take it from there .
\" we came to sit with marina , 
the whore of babylon ...
and confess . superfluous speech 
pure form against pure form ...
reflection of the empty 
full value .
we came to the last 
spectators before the crucifixion .
sat as apostles 
at her table ...
and our indifference betrays . \"
it seems like a 
matter of time ...
when to throw in the face 
someone is art .
you will sit in front 
of the artist in silence.
there will be no distractions 
somehow .
no gesture , speak , 
do not touch hands .
what happened ? okay ?
- are you nervous ? 
- i've been waiting 16 hours .
your time is coming . 
i 'll let you know . thank you .
send the next 
sit , please.
- we will . 
- i 'm next .
i know, i know .
the performance 
must continue.
- we expect tunji . 
- really? we must continue .
i hope 
back upstairs.
do not know if you 
should shoot me .
i'd love to sit down 
before her.
i did not realize 
that there were rules .
i would have obeyed 
if i knew .
but i wanted 
to be spontaneous.
what no one knew , 
that was something special with her .
and i thought that 
square ...
the public do 
art piece.
and i wanted to be 
vulnerable to it ...
as it is for everyone.
i think this display 
is a self-portrait . it's her .
she sits and delivery .
she always talks 
the here and now ...
but this piece ...
marina abramovic call : 
the artist is present ...
is a self-portrait .
she created a space 
charismatic ...
a rent 
the fabric of the universe ...
it was just her, 
she occupied .
and she did it in a room 
full of many people .
and many people felt 
charismatic this space ...
as a reality .
this is an achievement 
extraordinary .
