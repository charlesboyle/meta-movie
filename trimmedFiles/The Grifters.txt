mmm, mrs langtry,
i'm sorry
why?
what's wrong?
you are a valued customer,
as you know
but what's wrong?
i can't understand this
it's something you almost never see
what is?
this is some of the finest filigree
platinum i've ever seen
mm-hmm
but the stones, no
they're not diamonds,
mrs langtry
but they must be
they they cut glass
glass will cut glass,
mrs langtry
almost anything will
come with me
let me show you
a positive test for diamonds
yeah
take this
do you see how the water
splashes over them?
how it slides off
in a sheet?
with real diamonds,
it won't do that
it clings to the surface
in tiny droplets
i see it
i hope you're not too badly
disappointed with us, mrs langtry
it's not your fault
you'll give us an opportunity to
serve you again, i hope,
if there's anything you think
we might be interested in
well, i have
only one thing now
are you interested?
well, i would have to see it,
of course
you are seeing it
you're looking right at it
mrs langtry
something like this
very rarely happens
the fine setting and workmanship
usually means precious stones
it always hurts me
when i find they're not
i always hope
i'm mistaken
can i get a miller,
please?
- one too many, mister?
- what?
step away from the car
never mind let's see
your driver's license
you seem pretty sick,
mr dillon
well, it's a bad shrimp,
i think
didn't quite taste right
when i was eating it
i'm getting over it,
though
want us to take you
to the doctor?
no, i'm fine now
thanks
i've still got
a lot of clients to see
you take it easy, now
i will, thank you
have a good day, now
quinella wagering
on all 12 races...
hi, lilly
irv? irv, i'm done here
do i come back to baltimore?
no, no bobo wants
you to go on to la jolla
la jolla?
i never go to california
that's 1,000 miles from here
come on, lilly
you don't argue with bobo
he needs somebody
to handle playback there
maybe i'll swing around
los angeles on the way
take two or three days
call when you get there
yeah, okay
put it this way
say i rent to a woman
well, she has to have a room
with a bath,
because otherwise she's got
the hall bath tied up all the time,
washing her goddamn hair and her
clothes and everything she can think of
i had my first hotel
in wichita falls, texas,
and that's when i learned
about women
they don't make the money, see,
for a place like this
not regular, they don't
there's only one way they can get it
by sellin'their self
tappin'them cute little
piggy banks they all got
- mr dillon
- mr simms
here's a potential neighbor
of yours
mrs langtry may drop by
i'll send her right up
that's the fine type of person
i have in mind for here,
like yourself, i'm sure
well, don't you want to
see me?
of course, honey
i'll meet you at the bar
oh, honey,
i can't go there
well, what do you have
in mind?
come on you could
be here in 20 minutes
oh, i don't know, roy
i've got to get the train
from downtown,
and that's about an hour
from your place
in a minute
smack
heads
smack
tails
what do you want, kid?
show me how you did
that other one
scram, go home
i can't
i just left home
you're too young
you ought to be in school
i am in school
where's the 5?
in your other hand
good
you learned something
goodbye
i want to learn everything
you want to be a grifter?
a grifter, yes
not partners
that's your first lesson
cuts your score in half
right down the middle
worse than that,
you take a partner,
you put an apple on your head
and hand the other guy a shotgun
grifters, huh?
you're one, all right
grifters got an irresistible urge
to beat a guy who's wise
there's nothing to whipping a fool
hell, fools are made
to be whipped
but to take another pro,
even your partner,
who knows you
and has his eye on you
that's a score
no matter what happens
so, you want to learn
a few tricks,
i'll teach you
a few tricks
but your hand does
not get into my pocket
it's a deal
- roy
- mm-hmm
all right
forget the long con
if the fool tips, you're
caught you'll do time
never do time
and don't go dressing
like that
- why?
- it's showing off showing off!
any blind man
could spot you
yeah
give me $20
come around tomorrow,
i'll take you again
well, that's fine
two months we know each other,
you're already so bored
you fall asleep
before i get here
when you're not here,
all i can do
is dream about you, myra
you stink,
and i hate you
hmm
the twins seem to be
very restless
maybe we ought to put'em
to bed, huh?
you know
what i'm gonna do?
i'm gonna smother you
death, where is thy sting?
ahh
you smell good, myra,
like a bitch in a hothouse
ooh, darling
what a beautiful thing
to say!
maybe you don't smell
so good
i do, too
you just said so
it could be your clothes
it's me
do i have to prove it?
naturally
what?
simms, mr dillon
sure, mr simms
what can i do for you?
a visitor, mr dillon
a very attractive
young lady
she says she's your mother
send her up
come on in, lilly
hi, lilly
roy
long time no see
eight years
i'm just making some coffee
you want some?
just instant
it'd be nice
here we are
come on
sit down, lilly
so, what are we up to
these days?
still handling playback money
at the track
i'll be going back
to baltimore
as soon as the races
at la jolla are finished
so you're working
for that same bookmaker?
yeah
an easy life
usually
got a great view, roy
i guess you've been getting
my christmas cards
you always did have
a sense of humor
glad to see you, lilly
i'd have been hurt
if you hadn't have dropped by
i'm glad to see you,
too, roy
i'm not sure
what you're up to
up to? i'm not
up to anything, lilly
come on, roy
you can't kid me
you got so much more on the ball
than i ever did, and you know
what it does to a person
lilly, why don't you mind
your own goddamned business?
roy, what is it?
it's no sweat
god, you're ice cold
don't laugh at me
laugh? i'm not
laughing at you, honey
did somebody hurt you,
roy?
got hit in the stomach
a couple days ago
- let me see
- no
- let me see
- no!
dr mitchell?
it's lilly dillon, doctor
i work for just us amusement company
out of baltimore, and
what?
don't you brush me off,
buster
do i have to get bobo justus
to call you?
mrs dillon, i'm sorry
about our little disagreement
on the phone
and i'm really sorry
about your son
well, it's hard to believe
that such a strapping
young man is is your son
never mind that
just take care of him
yeah, well, he's had
he's had
an internal hemorrhage
he's bleeding to death
well, make it stop
his blood pressure's
under 100
i don't think
he's gonna make it to
you know who i work for
yeah, but there's just
so much i can do
my son is gonna be
all right
if not,
i'll have you killed
no, really
you're roy's mother?
mm-hmm
that's impossible
not quite
but
i'm not sure who you are,
mrs, uh, langtry,
was it?
i'm roy's friend
yes
i imagine you're lots
of people's friend
oh oh, of course
now that i see you
in the light,
you're plenty old enough
to be roy's mother
aren't we all?
play nice
don't fight
darling!
roy
you're gonna be all right
sure, i am
what am i doing here?
you were bleeding inside,
honey
remember that bruise
you had?
you called the doctor,
huh?
wellno, roy
your mother did
oh, yeah?
thanks
how long did they say
till i can get out of here?
roy, your mom saved
your life
yeah
second time
i gave it to you
i was kind of
inconvenient for lilly
you know, she was only 14
when i came along
in fact, i used to be
her kid brother
well, or so she'd say
well, you're all right now,
i guess
it's a two-hour drive
i'm late i have to go
down to the track
thanks, uh, lilly
don't mention it
i guess i owe you
my life
you always did
down to the track?
la jolla
her job
i want to know everything
about you

at 70 to 1
and they're off!
from the start, it's "fertile
crescent, " "troubadour, "
"otis blue," "buckmeister,"
"uncle louie"
down the backstretch,
"celadon star" has the lead by two lengths
with "call me hap" second
"six dreams" goes along
in third,
now "troubadour" now moving
stoutly on the outside
not troubadour no
rounding the far turn,
"celadon star" in front,
"call me hap" second
"blues bay" now begins to drop back
a little bit as "six dreams" moves up
now "troubadour" making
a bold move on the outside
they round the turn
into the homestretch,
and it's "celadon star" in front
on the outside,
"troubadour" now coming strong,
with "call me hap"
along the rail
those two vying for second
position, but it's "celadon star" in front
now "troubadour" begins to
pick up the pace
"celadon star" holding the
lead, "troubadour" coming on
it's "celadon star"
"troubadour" grinding
onto the outside
with a strong finish
"celadon star", "troubadour"
it's "troubadour" on the outside now,
going by to get the lead
"troubadour" winning it
by half a length
finishing odds were
as follows
today's amazing success story,
"troubadour," outsider,
at 70 to 1, in first place,
second place
- roy?
- mm-hmm?
- roy?
- mm-hmm?
what happens
when you get out of here?
a ticker-tape parade,
a key to the city,
sex with my baby
ah, the usual, i guess
and that's it?
what else?
well, that's
what i want to know
is is this
all we have, roy
"sex with my baby"?
not that i'm knocking it,
but is that all?
what are you driving at,
myra, marriage?
i didn't say that
ah but, well,
that's what i asked
- i don't think so
- ha
i'm a very practical
little girl,
and i don't believe in giving
any more than i get
and that might be
pretty awkward
for a matchbook salesman
or whatever you are
everybody needs matches
what do you sell, anyway?
self-confidence
god knows
you have it to spare
i'll see you tomorrow
hey
no kiss?
hello, mrs langtry
hi
time to rest
well, i'll leave you
in carol's good hands
hmm
you're looking
much better today
but you're not
you're looking very bad today
i am?
you belong in bed,
miss flynn
here
i'll give you part of mine
you will not
but you must
i've seen girls
with this look before
bed is the only thing
that will cure them
bed without dinner
might cure you
you'd better behave,
or i won't kiss you good night,
and then you'll be sorry
you'd better behave,
or i'll tell your mother
well, we wouldn't want that,
now, would we?
oh hi, myra
i didn't recognize you
no,
i'm sure you didn't
myra's been here
and what's your objection
to myra?
the same as anybody's
i stopped by your place,
picked up your mail
just bills
i'll take care of them
i can take care
of my own bills, lilly
whatever you say
the manager at your place
said your boss called
really pulled the wool
over everyone's eyes, huh?
what are you
talking about?
so i've got a job
so what?
stop kidding me
four years in a town
like los angeles
and a peanut-selling job's
the best you can do?
you expect me
to believe that?
well, it's there
the boss called
you said so yourself
that dump you live in?
those clown pictures
on the walls?
- i like those
- you do not
roy dillon,
cornball clown pictures,
commission salesman
it's all a front
you're working some angle,
and don't tell me you're not,
because i wrote the book
you're one to talk
you still running
playback money for the mob?
that's me
that's who i am
you were never cut out
for the rackets, roy, and if you
how come?
you aren't tough enough
not as tough as you, huh?
how'd you get that punch
in the stomach, roy?
i tripped on a chair
get off the grift, roy
why?
you haven't got
the stomach for it
oh, good, carol,
come in
dr mitchell says you can
get out of here friday,
but that you should have someone
to look in on you, so i hired carol
you hired?
well, you'll pay me back
i know that
lilly, i make my own decisions
for a long time now
roy, you couldn't possibly object
to a pretty, young lady
coming to visit you
carol
do you know why
my mother hired you?
why, yes
i'll come in every afternoon
and make sure
she hired you
for me to fuck
uh
to keep me away
from bad influences
isn't that right, lilly?
it is not
uh, mrs dillon,
perhaps i
go wait in the hall
don't go away
you didn't
have to do that
i thought i did
so you won't take a thing
from me, is that it?
sex?
i'm not offering you sex,
you little punk
that's not what i meant
for christ's sake, lilly,
you're just throwing
that wallflower at me
'cause you don't like myra
myra's nothing
she's less than nothing
then why does she
bug you?
you jealous?
of what?
you want to lie down
with dogs?
and i'll pick the dog
go ahead, roy
thanks, mom
that's right, i just
give you your life
what you do with it
is up to you
that's right!
myra here
sorry you missed me
tell me how to reach you,
and i will
baby, i'm getting out
of here today that's it
listen, let's go down
to la jolla this afternoon
we'll hit the beach
have some fun, huh?
take some time off,
forget all this other stuff
myra
don't tell me
you're addison simms
of seattle,
and we had lunch together
in the fall of 1902
myra, listen
myra, damn it!
listen, myra
joe
how's your wiry zone?
are hidden germs lurking
in your nooks
and crannies?
all right, this is
your final warning
you've got to settle
your bill today
now, joe, don't i always
pay my bills, huh,
one way or another?
yeah, well, this time
there's just one way
stop getting up
nights, man
you, too, could learn
to dance
all you need
is a magic step,
simple as one, two, three
here's your bill
it's a lot of money, joe
you wouldn't have
padded it
you owe
every damn cent of that
maybe i could get the dough from your wife
do you suppose?
maybe your kids'd
crack their piggy banks
you take one step towards my family,
and i promise you
oh, oh! don't wet your pants,
for christ's sake!
come in, joe
the money
there it is
the automatic clutch,
joe
it comes with the deluxe
upholstery
and the high-speed
wiry zone
myra, please
i've let you
i've been very good
to you
i've let you stay here
month after month
can't be done, joe
all passengers must pay
as they enter
no free passes or rebates
that's a strict rule
of the intercourse
commerce commission
oh, god
only one choice
to a customer,
the lady
or the loot
what's it gonna be?
your difference
between your folded towel
and your clean towel
is a trip to the laundry
when you're cleaning
those bathrooms,
what you do
is you pick up the towel,
and you give it a good shake
and a good look,
and you say to yourself,
"would i dry myself on this towel?"
if the answer is yes,
you fold it
what if it's wet?
mr dillon, welcome back
you're looking fine,
just fine
thank you, mr simms
i'm feeling fine
i'm glad you're better
- sickness comes to us all, mr dillon
- that's true, mr simms
we never know when,
we never know why,
we never know how
the only blessed thing we know
is it'll come at the most
inconvenient, unexpected time,
just when you've got tickets
to the world series,
and that's the way
the permanent waves
well
that fella could be
a congressman
if it's wet,
you don't fold it
you shake it and hang it
neatly on the rod provided
yes, sir
what are you laughing at?
oh, nothing
nothing, nothing
no, never mind, joe
it's just,
i was remembering
at lunch,
on the menu, it said
"today's special
"broiled
hothouse tomato
under generous slice
of ripe cheese"!
hi, bobo
did i buy you that dress,
you piece of shit?
well, i guess so
you're the guy i work for
- i'm the guy you work for, huh?
- yeah
then in that case,
i may just flush you down the toilet
take me to my hotel
troubadour
how'd you figure
you were gonna get away with that?
i'm not getting away
with anything, bobo
you're fucking right,
you're not
how much did your pals
cut you in for on that nag?
or are they giving you
the same kind of screwing you gave me?
i was down
on that horse, bobo,
maybe not as much
as i should've been
but there was
a lot of action
one question do you
want to stick to that story
or do you want to keep
your teeth?
i want to keep my teeth
all right,
i'll ask you another
you think i got
no contacts out here?
that nag paid off
on almost the opening price
there wasn't hardly
a flutter on the tote board
from the time
the first odds were posted
there ain't enough action
to tickle the tote board,
and you claim
a 10 grand win
you send me $10,000 like
i'm a fucking mark you can rip off
no, bobo, i didn't
you want to talk to me
straight up?!
my son
your what?
my son
was in the hospital
what the fuck
are you doing with a son?
he left home
a long time ago
he was in the hospital
up in los angeles
he was real sick
motherhood
i never fucked up
before, bobo
you got any kind
of long coat in the car,
something you could
wear home over your dress?
no
i'll loan you a raincoat
you guys take a walk
ugh!
will you go in the bathroom
and bring me a towel?
you ever hear
about the oranges, lilly?
you mean
the insurance framers
tell me about the oranges,
lilly
while you put those
in the towel
you hit a person
with the oranges
wrapped in a towel
they get big,
ugly-iooking bruises,
but they don't really
get hurt,
not if you do it right
it's for working scams
against insurance companies
and if you do it wrong?
it can louse up
your insides
you can get
p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p
what?!
p-p-permanent damage
you never shit right
again
bring me the towel
- whaaa!
- aaah!
ugh!
ugh!
oh, no!
oh, no!
oh, no! no!
aahhhhh!
oh, no!
come on, get up
you go clean yourself up
the coat's on the bed
oh, i almost forgot
troubadour, huh?
you want a drink?
gee, uh, i better not,
if that's okay
i still got to drive
up to los angeles
see your son, huh?
that's nice, lilly
a side of you i never knew
yeah, he's a good kid,
a salesman
- on the square, huh?
- yeah
how you making out
these days?
stealing much?
from you?
my folks didn't raise
no stupid kids
you're not skimming
a thing, lilly?
oh, well, you know,
clip a buck here
and a buck there,
not enough to notice
that's right take
a little, leave a little
a person who don't
look out for himself
is too dumb to look out
for anybody else
he's a liability,
right, bobo?
that's 1,000% right,
lilly
or else he's working
an angle
if he's not stealing
a little,
he's stealing a lot
you know it, lilly
you know, i
i like that suit, bobo
i don't know
what there is about it,
but
somehow it makes you
look taller
yeah?
yeah
you you really
think so?
yeah
a lot of people have been
telling me that
well
you can tell them for me
they're right
well, i best be going

a game of chances
it's getting
worse and worse, man
i'll tell you what,
i'll tell you what
take that away
take it
here, it's yours
it's great to get away,
isn't it,
take some time off?
next week,
i'll be back to work
you already
went back to work
what?
i watched you, working the tat
on those sailor boys
working the what?
oh, come on, roy, the tat,
what you do for a living
i'm a salesman
you're on the grift,
same as me
myra,
i'm not following this
roy, you're
a short-con operator
and a good one, i think
don't talk to me
like i'm another square
you talk the lingo
what's your pitch?
the long end, big con
nobody does that
single "o"
i was teamed 10 years with
the best in the business,
cole langley
i've heard the name
it was beautiful
and getting better
all the time
is that right?
it is, roy
it's where you should be
what do you bring in,
$300, $400 a week?
we used money like that
for tips
wow
and now, right now,
it's the perfect time,
the best time
since i been in the game
all over the southwest,
you got these businessmen
they were making money
when everybody
was making money
they think that means
they're smart
and now they're hurting
when the price of oil fell,
so did they
they still got money,
but they need more money
good morning
you may head right in
when the oil money
was good,
they put up all these
office buildings
now they're half empty
good morning
they'll give you anything
to move in,
first two months free,
redecoration,
whatever you want
they help you
set up the store
i'm the roper
i go out and find them
and bring'em in
morning, gentlemen
gloucester hebbing,
may i present my fine stockbroker,
henry fellowes?
gloucester
what we have here today,
mary beth,
is strictly between
oh, i told mr hebbing
all about it,
how brilliant you are
at making money
for your
special clients
well, i certainly
hope that you're not
spreading the news
a little too widely are you?
well, of course not,
but i'd trust mr hebbing
with anything
wouldn't i, darling?
well, i guess i'll just have
to take your word for that
won't i?
here's the money
goody!
please,
let me help you
once they saw that money,
they were hooked,
and i made sure
they saw it
well, isn't that just beautiful?
then all cole had to do
was tell the story
gloucester
we are talking about
breaking the law here
i just want to make sure
you understand that
no one is gonna get hurt,
but the law
is going to be broken
laws are made to be broken,
aren't they?
loose talk is the thing
i worry most about
i can keep my mouth shut
gloucester, come on
over here and sit down
now
tokyo exchange
is nine hours behind us
the new york exchange
is one hour ahead of us
there is never one hour
in which both exchanges
are open
information moves,
but it has to wait
now, i have a fellow
working for me
do you know
what a hacker is, uh?
yeah, sure, that's, like,
a computer expert or genius
very good, and what
this boy's been able to do
is tap into that main link
between tokyo and new york,
and when we really need it,
he's been able to give us
a 7-second delay
in the transfer
of that information
do you know
what that means?
well, i can see that you get
your information ahead of new york
every once in a while,
a major change happens,
and we have
a 7-second advantage
to put a buy order,
a sell order
into that computer
in new york
just before
that data from tokyo
comes pulling in
right behind it
not much time
no, we have to be ready,
we have to have the money,
we have to know
what that information means,
and we have to be able to move
like greased lightning,
but, boy, when it works,
it is beautiful!
seven seconds, huh?
i don't see
how you can do it
machines!
machines, gloucester!
i have got a whole room
full of machines back here
you want to see'em?
come here
oh, henry, no
come on, take a look!
i got a whole suite
full of mainframe computers
back here!
we're not really
interested, henry
oh, they are so beautiful
no, henry!
oh, you've got a minute
come on, gloucester
listen to'em hum
henry, don't try
mr hebbing's patience
you sure?
wellokay, then
cole liked
to take risks, huh?
he didn't think
they were risks
he was so good, roy,
he could just play
with a mark
he was so crooked,
he could eat soup
with a corkscrew
and when he got serious?
he'd explain
that he had to have cash
so there wouldn't be any
paper trail for the sec,
and a lot of cash
or it wasn't worthwhile
the least we ever took
was $40, 000,
and the most was
$185, 000 from one sucker
i thought these people
were broke
no, no, roy,
just cash poor
they had savings accounts,
stocks to sell
houses to mortgage,
sell their wife's jewelry
oh, they had plenty of money
when they put their minds to it
or when i put their minds to it
and a month later,
the sucker calls the cops,
and you're on the run
no, no
he never calls the cops,
not after we give him
the blow off
this is it
the money
whoo, i think
you're gonna be pleased
hoo, yeah!
come on, let me have one!
let me have one!
fbi everybody hold
what you got!
no, i don't have anything
to do with this!
the evidence
is right here!
- it's you, isn't it? you
- no, i swear to god!
you and your goddamn
big mouth?!
pipe down!
hey! hold it!
let me go!

oh, god
- come on with me now!
- no!
- nobody move! nobody!
- no!
come on, get him!
let's go! go, go, go!
ugh! ugh!
they never came back

even though i make you cry?
and can you feel
the heartbeat?
the breaking heart
in every sigh?
do ya, do ya need me?

oh, you do?
yep
expecting somebody?
no that was the point
- where'd you get that?
- an accident
roy, take that money back

i thought
i was hoping
we could play it straight
with one another
i guess not
i guess you won't be
getting a straight job either

i'm strictly short con
it's nothing
but small-time stuff

you're only 25 years old
already you can lay down
without even turning
your head
the grift's
like anything else, roy
you don't stand still
you either go up or down
usually down
sooner or later
well, i'll let it be
a surprise then

what'd you do with yourself
all afternoon?
i went out to the track
what were you doing
at the track?
did you run
into my mother?
no how could i?
i was in the clubhouse
lilly wouldn't be
in the clubhouse, would she?
how did you know that?
okay i saw her
she didn't see you,
in other words?
i saw her out there,
and i was curious
you know, she's always
so nasty to me
and i know she's knocking me
to you every chance she gets
so, i called a friend
of mine in baltimore,
so now i know who she is
you must have some
very knowledgeable friends
i'm well-connected, roy
cole introduced me
to a lot of people
very valuable
valuable for us
running your broker scam,
you mean?
what a team we'll make
you won't regret this, roy
regret what? i didn't say
i was coming aboard
but why not?
i thought it was settled
nothing was ever settled
uh-huh
it's your mother talking
against me, isn't it?
she's got nothing
to do with this
- i make my own decisions
- that's not what lilly thinks
who cares
what she thinks?
i don't care
what she thinks
i left home when i was 17
with nothing but stuff
i bought and paid for myself,
nothing from lilly
darling, guess what?
i had to tell you
right away
i called a fellow
i know in tulsa
the the one
who plays my chauffeur
he says that there's
a sucker there that's made for us
and a broker
that just shut down
we can use their office,
not change a thing
now
i can scrape up 10 grand
if i try
i got a couple of aces
in the hole,
some markers i could call on
for something real
that leaves $15,000
or $20,000 for your end
we can start this weekend
get the sucker
into position
hold it
you're talking
some pretty tall figures
what makes you think
i got that kind of money?
well, you must have
now, you know you do, roy
maybe i like it
where i am
well, maybe i don't
i had 10 good years
with cole,
and i want'em back
i gotta have a partner
i looked and i looked,
and believe me, brother,
i kissed
a lot of fuckin'frogs
and you're my prince
do i get any say in this?
no because
that's what i say
what i say is no
we don't do partners
what is it?
what's going on?
why don't you want to team up?
the best reason
i can think of
is that you scare
the hell out of me
i have seen women
like you before, baby
you're double-tough,
and you are sharp as a razor
and you get what you want
or else,
but you don't make it
work forever
sooner or later,
the lightning hits
and i'm not gonna be around
when it hits you
my god
it's your mother
it's lilly
what?
sure it is
that's why you act so funny
around each other
what's that?
oh, don't act
so goddamned innocent
you and your own mother?
ugh!
you like to go back
where you've been, huh?
watch your mouth
yeah
yeah, i'm wise to you
i should've seen it before,
you rotten son of a bitch
how is it, huh?
how do you like it?
ah!
ow!
stop stop stop
stop stop!
that's not like me
i don't do this
that's why
we wouldn't work together
you're disgusting
your mind is so filthy,
it's hard to look at you
goodbye
and you don't even
know it
mama mama
she's the one
and you'll get yours, mama
oh, yes
yeah?
lilly, it's roy
lilly, i was wondering
if, um,
i was wondering
if we could just talk
you know, like,
have a conversation?
maybe we've both grown up
maybe we could just
talk
well, sure, roy
you want me to drive up?
no
okay
i'll come there tonight
fine come on down
it won't be a home-cooked
meal, you know
well, that's good news
well, who's a boy gonna talk to
if not his mother?
don't worry
i'll look after her
roy?
lilly, listen, it's irv
you've always been
decent with me
i'm taking a hell
of a chance here
somebody blew you out with bobo
the car full of money
he's
lilly? lilly!
lilly, come on
lilly!
bobo knows about
all the money in the car,
the money you stole
from him
a black and gold
cadillac
fuck!
- hi
- hi
welcome to phoenix
i'd like a single room
for tonight
everything's the same size,
same price
i'm a very light sleeper
traffic noise keeps me
wide awake all night
the trucks
i know what you mean
do you have something
around back,
facing away from the road?
i could put you in
room 19
very quiet
faces the desert
sounds perfect
could i park my car
back there?
right in front
of the room
somethin'wrong?
oh i'm sorry
i thought
you were the other lady
no, i'm me
i'll give you number 6
very nice room,
very handy
in the front,
right by the pool
oh don't you have
something around back,
where it's quieter?
everybody wants the back
tonight
i guess
everybody wants privacy
roy dillon?
lieutenant pierson,
phoenix police
i have a car here
there was
a bunch of money
- hidden in your mother's car
- yeah?
a lot of money
- would you know anything about that?
- no
i realize this is a shock
mostly,
i don't believe it
well, that's natural
no i mean,
i don't believe it
i know my mother
lilly is not a suicide
nothing would make her
check out
i'm sorry
it was her, all right
it was her gun even
her gun?
mm-hmm
there is one thing
i have to caution you
normally we don't do
a next-of-kin i d,
unless there's
no other choice
in this case, there's
no fingerprints on file
the dental records
don't help
because of the location
of the wound
she ate the gun
i'm sorry
this is going to be
a shock
not many laughs
in this room, huh?
not many
remove that
we'll want
a full identification
jesus
no question, huh?
no
well
that's that then
yeahthat's that
ohh
mom
the last modern thing
i liked was the miniskirt
your technology now
nobody understands it
that's the simple fact
of the situation
good evening,
miss, uh, langtry
hello, lilly
oh
roy
you scared me
you going somewhere?
somewhere else,
that's for sure
i just came back
from phoenix
oh, yeah?
is the frame holding?
it looks very solid,
lilly
take a minute
tell me about it
i've really got to go
you're dead, lilly
it worked
yeah, but not for long
cops may buy it,
- but bobo will spend money to make sure
- even so
relax a minute
sit down
just for a minute
put that down
myra followed you, huh?
yeah
i guess she must have
been the one
that blew me off
with bobo,
to get me running
did you tell her
about my stash?
no
that's what she was after, though
what happened in phoenix?
oh, roy
it was terrible
you read about people killing people
and all that
but when it happens
my god
she was in her nightgown,
you know
the old grifter's dodge
nightgown
and the ice bucket,
and she just got in
the wrong room by mistake
ah!
ah!
i sat in there with her
i thought,
"what do i do now?"
run, i've got bobo
and the law after me
stay, how do i explain?
this was perfect
it is, isn't it?
i've wanted out
of the rackets for years
and now i'm out
i can make
a clean break
you've already made a break
i don't know
how clean it is
i'm sorry, roy
i hated to take your money
you're not taking it
roy!
i need this money!
i can't run
without money!
and if i can't run,
i'm dead!
- you must have some money
- just a few bucks
myra's stuff?
her credit cards
how far am i gonna get
with that?
far enough
san francisco, st louis,
someplace new start over
at what?
you're smart,
you're good-iooking
you won't have any trouble
finding a job
a job? i've never had
a legit job in my life
well, you're gonna start
if you want to live through this
you're gonna get
a square job,
and you're gonna lead
a quiet life
you start showing up at the tracks
or any of the hot spots,
bobo's boys are
gonna be all over you
roy, don't tell me what
to do with myself
- it's a big world out there
- not anymore
lilly, listen to me
it's good advice
- i'm following it myself
- what?
you want me out
of the rackets,
you want me off the grift,
i think i'm gonna get out
roy, that's fine,
but i don't have time for this!
- bobo's after my ass
- i thought you'd be happy for me!
after all, you're the one who's telling me
what to do all my goddamn life!
bobo's not after you!
bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good,
- but so am i
- what makes you think
- i'm a survivor, roy i survive
- i'm gonna let you get out of here
- and to survive my way, i need money
- with my goddamn money?
and that leaves this
no
want a drink?
no you probably
shouldn't have one either
no, but
i'm goddamn thirsty
ice water?
sure
that sounds nice
i'll get it
take whichever one
you want
you wouldn't do that
you don't know
what i'd do
you have no idea
to live
you'll live, lilly
i know what's bugging you,
of course
oh, i didn't know
anything was
i wasn't a very good mother
to you when you were a kid
it was pretty lousy of me,
i guess
to be a child at
the same time you were
oh, for god's sake, lilly
i gave you your life twice
i'm asking you
to give me mine once
i need the money, roy
no
so, you're getting off
the grift, huh?
i might
that's good
you don't really belong
on this side
of the fence, you know?
i don't?
if you stayed a crook,
you think you'd live
to be my ripe age?
well, i don't see
why not
hmm
i guess i got it wrong, then
seems to me i heard about
a guy just your age
who got hit so hard
in the guts
it almost killed him
well
oh, that's different
that doesn't count
it doesn't really matter,
does it, if i'm getting out?
you're getting out?
you're on the level?
you don't need the money!
so why the hell
can't i take it?!
lilly, my money
wouldn't last forever
and then what?
you'd be stuck in some other part
of the rackets
with another bobo justus
to slap you around
and burn holes
in your hand
if you can't change
your life now
while you're still
relatively young,
how could you do it
when you were, say, crowning 50?
this way, you gotta go
the square route
send me a card
when you get settled
i could maybe help
you out sometime
roy
what if i told you
that i wasn't really your mother?
that we weren't related?
what?
you'd like that,
wouldn't you?
sure, you would
you don't have to tell me
now, why would you
like that, roy?
what are you
talking about?
of course you're my mother
of course you are
roy
roy
there's nothing more
to talk about
i want that money, roy
i need it
now, what do i have to do
to get it?
you mean you won't
give it to me, roy?
will you
or won't you?
what can i do to get it?
is there nothing
i can do?
lilly, jesus,
what are you doing?
nothing at all
nothing at all
uhhhhh!
uuuuhhh!
no, no, no, no
no, no
