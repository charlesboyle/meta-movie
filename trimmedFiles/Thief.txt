well, i'm gonna
put it back together.
look, i met this new chick,
this jessie.

- yes.
but, uh...
she does not know

do i bullshit her along, or what?
lie to no one.
if they're somebody close to you,
you're gonna ruin it with a lie.
and if they're a stranger,
who are they you gotta lie to?
hey, what do you need, man?

<i>regular highline pro.</i>
so i said to gags,
"i want to meet this guy."
- he tell you that?
- yes.

<i>who is he?</i>
how the hell do i know?
you want to put down contract scores all
over the country, working directly for me?
i am self-employed.
i am doin' fine.
i don't deal with egos.
i am joe the boss of my own body,
so what do i have to work for you for?
maybe you don't.
i'll lay it out. you can be the judge.
<i>you don't look...</i>
you don't case,
you don't do nothin'.
we point you to a score.
when we say it's there,
it's there.
they're all laid-out scores.
how are they worked up?
alarm system diagrams, blueprints,
sometimes a front-door key.
sometimes the scores are in on it.
everybody's ripping off
the insurance company.
- work cars? drops? tools?
- whatever you need, you'd see me.
i'd be your father.
money, guns, cars...
i'd be your father from here on out.
- what's my end?
- you get a price. no negotiation.
we got expenses you don't have.
but you'll know the price up front.
- how big?
- boxcar.
nothin' under six figures. i'll make
you a millionaire in four months.
i go to work for you,
i'm pullin' a lot of exposure.
- our protection trades that off.
- yeah, i take a bust.
turn around,
there's gonna be a lawyer...
a bondsman right there...
you never spend a night in jail.
look, i steal ice.
no furs, no coin collections...
no stock certificates, no cartage,
no treasury bonds, no nothin'.
- just diamonds or cash.
- fine.
- no cowboy shit. no home invasions.
- fine.
- i work with a partner.
- we take care of you.
a partner is strictly your responsibility.
he beefs on you, that's your problem.
he beefs on us,
that's your problem too.
who are your inside people?
that's my end. you don't have
to know anything about that.
so what do you say?
<i>i don't know.</i>
- what do you mean, you don't know?
- i don't know!
i don't believe
in lifetime subscriptions.
maybe it don't fit in with
my retirement program.
what are you gonna do retired?
pick corn with the chickens.
watch daytime tv the rest of my life.
what's the difference?
all right, all right.
two, three moves.
you want to keep goin',
that's fine.
but if you wanna split,
that's fine too.
everybody's business-like.
everybody's an adult.
so let me know...
'cause we'd be terrific.
yeah, that's fine.
i'll call ya.
<i>- you wanna pick him up?
- we'll see.</i>
<i>come on,
let's groove it one time.</i>
- hurry. i got my car parked in red.
- what the hell are you doing here?
- finding you.
- get away from me, okay?
you are two hours late.
i do not need this.
i do not need to be humiliated.
- wait. i want to talk to you.
- no.
<i>hey, you!</i>
i will take you for coffee and explain.
what's the big goddamn deal?
you, take me anywhere?
that's a big laugh.
- look, maybe there is a reason.
- hey, i'm talkin' to you.
hey! take a walk, flash.
all right? go on.
- hey, watch out, baby!
i don't know the reason.
i don't want to hear the reason.
there is no reason.
that's all.
what's the big goddamn...
- look, you were lookin' forward to this.
all right?
come on.
- get in the car, darling.
- no!
wait a minute!
<i>- hey!
- my god!</i>
<i>oh, man!</i>
- what did i do?
- why did you push him?
look, in what i do,
there are sometimes pressures.
what the hell
do you think that i do?
come on, come on!
come on! every morning i walk in
for five months, say hi.
what the hell
do you think that i do?
you sell little fuckin' cars,
that's what you do.
i wear $150 slacks!
i wear silk shirts!
i wear $800 suits!
i wear a gold watch!
i wear a perfect d flawless,
three-carat ring!
i change cars like other guys
change their fuckin' shoes!
i'm a thief.
i've been in prison.
- so what? i don't care.
- "so what"?
- don't tell me
- i never even told my wife that!
- i don't care!
- who is now gone.
- did i ever come on to you?
- no.
- well, you see?
- see? see what?
see... i am a straight arrow.
i am a true-blue kind of a guy.
i've been cool.
i am now unmarried.
so let's cut the mini-moves
and the bullshit...
and get on
with this big romance.
what?
i don't believe it!
do you think i have been waiting
for you to come along?
what is this shit?
you think i'm kiddin'. i can tell.
this is strictly on the up-and-up.
jesus christ!
- you are scared to death.
- you're an asshole.
that's lovely.
what are you doing in your life
that is so terrific?
- my life is fine.
- yeah, sure. here.
- you don't know about me.
- yeah?
- i know all about...
- you know bullshit.
hey.
why you gotta shout?
excuse me.
can we have two coffees here?
sorry. so?
<i>"so"?
so what?</i>
so tell me.
menus?
no, thanks.
so, uh, what was it like?
<i>you know, a lot of money.
tucson...</i>
mexico city, bogotá.
drifting, you know.
okay?
<i>okay.</i>
<i>it got twisted
and ugly and empty.</i>
it was over already, but we kept
moving through the moves.
it ended very badly.
now i get up in the morning,
i take a shower...
i go to work, i have a job,
i have a social security card.
and my life is very ordinary,
very boring...
which is good,
because it's solid.
you're marking time
is what you are.
you're backing off.
you're hiding out.
you're waiting for a bus
you hope never comes...
because you don't want to get on it anyway
because you don't wanna go anywhere.
do you have a license for this?
all right,
how much was he moving?
nothing, till the end.
and then kilo amounts.
i don't... i don't know.
and then what?
- he's dead.
- hmm?
he is dead.
that is good,
because he's an asshole.
- there was a lot of love in the beginning.
- the guy was an asshole.
- there was love in the beginning.
- a big asshole.
he put you in a box.
you know the things they do to you...
ten times a day
if you do a bit in colombia?
- do you? jesus christ!
- don't shout in here.
i was alone.
i had no money,
no clothes, no visa...
standing on the corner
in bogota' in colombia.
things did happen.
where were you in prison?
would you pass the cream, please?
joliet.
the warden...
whoa, god!
hey, can we have
some new cream here?
what's wrong with it?
"what's wrong with it?"
it's cottage cheese.
the warden there was,
uh, joe reagan.
"meatball joe."
if that slob was a penologist,
i'm a jet airplane pilot.
i did 11 years.
i got out, what,
four years ago.
<i>what'd you go up for?</i>
i stole $40.
forty dollars?
yeah.
<i>started with a two-year bit,
parole in six months.</i>
and then right away...
i got into this problem
with these two guys.
they tried to turn me out.
so i picked up nine more...
on a manslaughter beef...
some other things.
i was 20 when i went in,
you don't count
months and years.
you don't do time that way.
what do you mean?
why?
<i>why?
you gotta forget time.</i>
you gotta not give a fuck
if you live or die.
you gotta get to where
nothin' means nothin'.
<i>i'll tell you a story
all about it.</i>
once there was
this captain morphis...
this 300-pound slob.
he couldn't write his name.
and he had this crew...
of 16 or 17
guards and cons.
prison groups, you know?
crews.
they would go
into these cells...
and grab these young guys...
and bring 'em up
to hydrotherapy in the mental ward.
uh, gang bang.
if a guy puts up a struggle,
they beat him half to death...
and he winds up
in the funny farm.
anyway, word comes down
that i am next...
and i do not know
what i am supposed to do.
i, uh... i am scared.
<i>11:30, 12:00,
lights come on.</i>
i got this pipe
from plumbing...
and, uh...
i whacked the first guard
in the shins.
i go through a convict
and another convict and...
anyway, i get to morphis,
and i whack him across the head twice.
boom. and then they jump
all over me, do a bunch of things.
i spent six months
in the hospital ward, but...
morphis, he is also
fucked up real good.
cerebral hematoma.
they pension him out,
he can't walk straight...
and he dies two years later...
which is a real loss
to the planet earth.
<i>meanwhile,
i gotta go back...</i>
<i>into the mainstream population...</i>
and i know the minute i hit the yard,
lam a dead man.
<i>so i hit the yard.</i>
<i>so you know what happens?</i>
nothin'.
i mean, nothin' happens.
'cause i don't mean nothin' to myself.
i don't care about me.
i don't care about... nothin',
you know?
and then i know
from that day that i survive...
because i achieved
that mental attitude.
then, uh...
see, later, i...
i worked this out.
<i>in the stone cell.</i>
what is this?
<i>that is my life.</i>
and, uh...
nothin', nobody can stop me
from makin' that happen.
and right there,
that would be you.
who...
who's the old man here?
that is david okla bertinneau.
he's a master thief-
a master...
and a great man.
he was like a father.
he taught me everything...
that i know about what i do.
and i told him about you.
did you cut these out
from magazines and...
yeah. newspapers, whatever.
why...
why all of these
dead people?
<i>inside,
you are on ice from time.</i>
you can't even die right,
you know? and here...
<i>here, people grow.</i>
<i>they get old, they die.</i>
<i>children come after.</i>
<i>just a cycle, you know?</i>
i don't know. i...
yes, you do. you do.
you don't know
from one day to the next...
whether you're going to be killed,
go home, or get busted.
look, i have run out of time.
i have lost it all.
and so i can't work
fast enough to catch up...
and i can't run
fast enough to catch up...
and the only thing
that catches me up...
is doin' my magic act.
but it ends, you know?
it will end.
when i got this,
right there...
<i>it ends, it's over.</i>
so i'm just asking you...
to be with me.
i can't.
i can't, uh...
i can't have children.
i don't fit into this.
what? so we adopt.
i... i'm not ready, see?
and-and i have my life.
- so i... i can't.
<i>- what?</i>
i mean, what is going on
in your life that is so terrific?
mine's been a mess.
<i>i was just thinkin',
you know, that...</i>
<i>just maybe
between the two of us...</i>
<i>we could make
somethin' happen...</i>
<i>somethin' special,
somethin' really nice.</i>
<i>you know?</i>
<i>so i'm just, uh...
i'm just askin' you...</i>
uh, to, uh...
look, i got a way now
i can make it happen faster.
i mean, much faster.
and, uh, i'm just...
i'm just askin' you,
you know?
you're on.
they gotta be big scores.
they gotta be fast.
one, two tops.
right.
<i>- that's it.
- where?</i>
third from the top, this side.
- alarm systems?
- five independent systems.
four silent ringers into an alarm
company over the phone lines.
infrared pots...
magnetics on the front door,
sonic alarm.
<i>- vault door's bugged.</i>
- what's this?
this is the top floor.
top of the elevator shafts.
floors eight through 14's alarm lines
conduit with the phones...
through the top
of the elevator shaft.
what about taking the elevator
to the top floor...
open the hatch,
and goin' in that way?
no. elevators are locked down
and bugged at night.
your way, i gotta take out
two systems.
chop through the roof
and get the lines that way.
assuming we get the alarm,
what is the box?
richmond-lackett.
- <i>richmond-lackett?</i>
- yeah.
terrific. it's a burn job.
- no way to drill?
- "drill"?
- <i>yeah.</i>
- drill what?
they're custom-made. you bang
on this box all day, nothin' happens.
<i>and i am pulling
a lot of exposure.</i>
sixteen, 18 hours in there.
your end covers the risk.
four million at wholesale
in unmounted stones.
- what's the fifth alarm?
- we cannot run it down.
why?
because it does not go out
over the phone lines.
we swept the lines
in the whole building.
but we know it is there.
how long?
four, eight weeks...
assuming we get the alarm...
and what to cut the box with.
i need a couple cal licenses,
and two new work cars here.
okay. i'll set it up.
what time's our plane?
we're on the 2:30.
stay here
and make out that fifth alarm.
<i>you like it?</i>
i mean...
do you think it'll do or what?
it's okay?
frank, i love it. i love it.
i think it's terrific.
what are you looking at?
you, that's all.

seven, eight thousand degrees?
portable equipment?
- there's no other way to do it?
- no.
sonny,
if i can build something...
it's gonna be
a son of a bitch to use.
okay, so is it worth it?
it is worth it.

<i>yeah.</i>
<i>i'll be in division 126 in an hour.
i'm wearing a gray leather coat.</i>
good.
so what's to it, sam?
i gotta build
a section of vault to tell.
so i don't know if it's even possible
to build a tool that'll cut it like that.
see me in a week.
the nature of this petition is that david
okla bertinneau pleads for your honor...
to modify the instruction
of his 1958 conviction...
and to issue
a writ of habeas corpus.
but he violated chapter 38,
section 19-1: burglary...
<i>chapter 38, section 16-1: theft...</i>
here's two california licenses
i fixed in sacramento.
...and dignity of the state.
that distresses me,
your honor...
'cause this man
is of reformed character...
advanced age, and suffers
from a severe heart condition...
<i>and may not be able
to serve out his sentence.</i>
he's spent over 21 years
of incarceration...
and has become
a different person.
i don't know.
i remain unconvinced.
- are they pickin' their noses?
- wait. i want to hear this.
however,
upon consideration...
i will issue
a writ of habeas corpus.
<i>thank you, your honor.
i'll write up the order.</i>
i know
how busy your docket is.
my wife's in the market
for a fur coat.
i am a car salesman.
sure.
whatever you say.
<i>- that's right.</i>
okla will be on the street
in a week.
i need 6,000 for earl warren.
a week? yeah?
here. ten thousand.
you're a prince.
buy yourself a new suit.
- a week?
- a week.
all right.
who lives here?
- come on, who lives here?
- hi.
it's gotta be
some millionaire guy, huh?
hey, look at this.
tree. bush.
- pink tree.
- hello!
<i>- hi!</i>
- pink?
- hey. it's real nice.
- sure. come in back.
- hi, frank.
- how you doin', marie?
- this is beautiful, man.
<i>- when did you get back?</i>
oh, uh, last night, late.
you, uh... you make
that fifth alarm?
i made the fifth alarm.
good.
- so, uh, what's to it?
- okay.
alarm system number five
is a one-channel radio transmitter.
- how's it triggered?
- there's a sonic detector off the ceiling.
they set off the alarm every
morning when they walk in.
ring, ring, ring.
it's tripped.
they have ten seconds to transmit a code
word to the alarm company to cancel it.
now, the code word
goes over the radio.
that's why
there's no phone lines.
all right, i tell you what.
- you bug it.
- all right.
call joseph, have him fix you one,
go back out there...
and you bug 'em for the word.
come on.
it's gettin' cold.
oh. uh...
this l.a. move, you know-
it's home free for me
after it's done.
you happy?
come on.
frank,
want something to eat?
well...
i see
on your application here...
by the way,
you misspelled "male."
it's m-a-l-e.
the other is what
we put in postboxes.
<i>i see you put
under "employer"...</i>
"1959 to 1976,
joliet state penitentiary."
- yes.
- you worked for the state, i take it?
- after a fashion.
- what did you do at the prison?
desks.
i, uh, spot-welded desks...
and then i got
promoted to shoes.
<i>you were in charge
of the shop?</i>
lady, i was a convict.
i was doing time.
- you were what?
- frank, let's go.
<i>uh, you have to understand...</i>
<i>we have more applicants
than children.</i>
then why do you still
have kids here?
as a kid, i would not be falling all over
myself to stay in one of these places.
we will relieve you
of some of the burden.
the point is, we establish
criteria for parenting...
and an ex-convict
compared to other desirables...
wait. so we'll take a kid
that's not so desirable.
you got a black kid?
we'll take a black kid.
<i>- you got a chink kid?
- you don't understand...</i>
no one likes older kids. you got
an eight-year-old black chink kid?
we'll take him.
- frank...
- if it's a matter of, you know... here.
- what is that?
- "what is that"?
that is d flawless,
- this is not a marketplace.
- <i>right.</i>
you're not smart enough to take this any
more than you are to recognize good parents.
get out of my office.
you did not ask about us,
what kind of people we are.
there is a child waiting,
and you are denying us him and him us.
- who the hell are you?
- don't make a scene.
- our criteria...
- your criteria?
your criteria are so far up your ass, they
can't see daylight. this is bullshit!
look, it's not happening.
let's go.
i got some abc-type
information for you, lady.
i was state-raised...
and this is a dead place.
a child in eight-by-four
green walls...
after a while you tell the walls,
"my life is yours."
- you grow up in the suburbs?
- yes.
right. right.
what are you lookin' at?
huh?
jimmy's got better.
<i>yeah, it's 'cause
he charcoals them... charcoals.</i>
- i'm gonna pull him over here.
- yeah.
hey, how you doin'?
- i'm wonderful, thank you.
- yeah, that's good.
you know, a very important thing
for you to remember...

good things for ya.

it means...
heat, police.
means it's hard for me
to make moves from now on.
beepers on the cars,
the works.
are they in the walls? can they hear
everything we say all the time?
probably it's just the phones,
but i'll check.
