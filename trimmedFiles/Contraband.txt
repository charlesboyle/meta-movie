<i>we have india
<i>flight 104 is 500 yards in
trail, waiting for your go.</i>
that's it, right there.
there's our guy.
<i>begin your final
approach to the target.</i>
<i>flight 104, copy that.</i>
shit!
walter, wake up. customs.
what? who?
we need the fucking bag.
where the fuck is the key?
tighten that line.
now secure the other side.
easy, easy up.
okay, okay.
hurry up. come on,
put it in the bag.
come on!
pull this up.
come on, come on. let's go!
go, andy.
stop!
federal officer! don't move!
excuse me. excuse me, y'all. can
i have everybody's attention?
i want to do a quick toast to the
bride and groom, danny and shelly.
congratulations.
i can't believe it, man.
i'm fucking married, chris.
danny, i know. i was standing
right there with you.
look, what about
this fucking guy?
he's my best friend,
best man at my wedding.
he doesn't even remember that
this is where my reception was.
thank god he's sober.
you don't remember?
i remember throwing up
on kate's shoes.
yeah, i remember, too.
i apologized for that.
everybody, do it like this.
i mean, you were like the
lennon and mccartney of smuggling.
how do you smuggle a fucking ferrari?
where do you hide it?
we didn't.
we let customs
seize it in port.
give me your phone.
you take the guts out.
the transmission,
the wiring system.
take all that shit out, hide
it inside other containers.
so, when customs
auctions off the car,
he gets himself a ferrari
for next to nothing.
he just bought the empty shell?
yes, he got the empty
shell at the auction.
and then we...
sell him the missing parts.
...sold him back the guts.
and he's got himself
a new ferrari
for less than you paid for
that piece-of-shit honda.
it's a nice honda.
yeah, that's why you
live in it, right?
because it's a
nice fucking honda.
can i dance with my wife?
hey, what's up, buddy?
can i get another one of
these when you get a chance?
hey, chris.
church, hey.
how are you doing, man?
long time, no see.
where you been?
well, i'm living
out in algiers now.
the fuck are you
doing out there?
it's nice, i like it out there.
it's good for the family.
a guy like you don't
belong in algiers, chris.
what are you doing for work?
i started my own business,
setting up alarm systems.
fill that up, will you?
your old man getting
jailed freak you out? huh?
i guess.
that, and having a wife and
two little boys, you know?
yeah.
you've got to stick to what
you're good at, though, chris.
listen, i offered to take care of
that ship captain for your dad.
he said no.
anyway, chris, if you're ever
thinking of getting back in,
let me know, okay?
yeah?
yeah.
good.
i don't even know why we're
doing this in the first place.
just trust me, okay?
it will be cool.
if we try to run,
it will make it worse.
where are these guys?
here we go, here we go.
be cool, now.
here we go, here we go.
hey, man.
customs boarded us,
we had to dump the package.
you did?
we had no choice.
right?
nothing we could do, man.
that's it.
what did i say?
i told you it was cool.
come on, man, let's
get the fuck out of here.
hello?
it's my brother.
what happened?
is he okay?
no. we've got to go now.
what?
walter is in surgery.
what the fuck happened, andy?
it was an accident.
you know what? you're a shitty
liar, so don't even fucking try.
look at me when
i'm talking to you.
i was running something.
we got boarded,
and i dumped it.
you dumped what?
the coke.
kate; oh, fuck.
it was over 10 pounds.
for who?
for tim briggs
and those guys.
they're going to kill me.
andy, they're not
going to kill you.
it was a lot of stuff.
i'm sorry.
you should be fucking sorry.
is he all right?
no, the little fuckhead
was running something
and he dumped it.
now he owes.
who? who does he owe?
tim briggs.
ask around, see what you
can find out, all right?
how is kate?
not good.
i can't believe he did that.
when i quit, i told him to
stay away from these guys.
please, if you had anything to do
with this, just tell me right now.
i just told you.
okay.
he's my little brother.
i know. i'm going to
take care of it.
i got you..
i'll call you in the morning.
okay, no problem.
good night.
so you said king
security put the system in?
that's right.
a lot of good it did.
it's a decent system,
but your locks are a joke.
anybody who knows
the response time
is going to be able
to get in and out.
can you excuse me
for one second, sir?
yes.
<i>it's
about briggs, kyle's brother.</i>
<i>yeah, and?</i>
i don't know, hold on.
guys! guys!
how are we doing today?
is my office still going
to be done last week?
you having a nice morning?
good!
briggs got out of
prison two months ago.
he hangs out
at the old point bar.
i'll pop over there after i'm done
work and see if i can talk to him.
sorry about that, sir.
the cameras are nice and small,
they'll fit right up
there in the corner.
oh, shit!
chris farraday, back from
the dead, man! yeah!
good to see you, man.
oh, shit. this man was
a world-class smuggler here.
you were fucking houdini, man.
yeah, he used to run with my brother,
god rest his miserable soul.
too bad your skill
didn't rub off
on your shithead
brother-in-law.
no, i know,
he's a fuck-up.
mmm. but he's my
wife's little brother.
i was hoping you
understand it's family,
maybe we could
work something out.
well, i don't know.
what do you want to work out?
you want to work out
something with me?
i can figure out a way to
pay you back the buy money.
no, that's worth
oh, come on, man.
no, come on, man.
you're going to try to charge
me full freight for a bad run?
customs boards the boat, you dump that shit.
you know how it goes.
you know how many passes i
gave your brother in his day?
yeah, i hated my brother.
what do you want to do,
a payment plan?
what, do i look like
a bank to you?
no, i was just hoping you could
be fucking reasonable, here.
hey! this ain't your
world any more, man!
you're a tourist, you can't
trade on status you don't have.
i got bills to pay.
you know, when people fuck that
up, that's their fucking problem.
you think that's funny?
you got bills?
i like your outfit.
i liked your brother.
we're here today,
that's the important thing.
so, you know, learning to
let go and let god
is what's been pulling me
through all of this.
you're going to have to talk me
down before i fucking kill briggs.
probably be better off.
i'm one drink away from
the worst day of my life.
what should i do?
...sitting in this circle
that's had that same thought, right?
that's all you gotta do,
is work the steps.
i'm not doing another run.
no fucking way.
i could probably get us
the buy money, no problem.
no, i finally got
something going.
i'm not going to
chance fucking it up.
it's not going away, chris.
does somebody want to share?
sebastian? want to share
a little bit with us?
okay.
oh, yeah.
go do your thing.
you don't want to stick around?
no, i get far too emotional
hearing that story.
how are you doing, sebastian?
what the hell happened?
walter died last night.
briggs came to the hospital.
he said it was all on me.
i keep getting calls, chris,
and they're talking about how they're
going to fucking torture me.
i'm shipping out in the next couple of days.
i'm not coming back.
do me a favor, and don't tell kate.
not until i'm gone.
when i stopped doing runs,
you promised me you were
gonna stay out of this shit.
what do you want me
to say, man?
not a fucking word!
i didn't have anybody to tell
me i was fucking up. you do!
and you put your sister
and the boys in this shit?
what the fuck is
wrong with you?
whoa.
you don't come
to my fucking place.
i just came to tell you
that i'm going to have
your money within a month.
just stay away from andy.
i ain't waiting that long.
well, i ain't paying
if he's dead.
if a guy dies owing something,
his family inherits the debt.
so i'll give you two weeks.
if not, i'm going to come
after the both of you.
then, all the way
down the line.
i'll come asking your
wife for it, your kids...
do you think you're the only
guy with a fucking gun?
you'll get your fucking money.
but if you ever mention my wife
and my kids again, you're done.
you hear me?
you are fucking done!
daddy.
it's okay, sweetie.
go back inside.
it's okay, sweetie. daddy and
i were just playing, okay?
it's okay.
yeah, we're just playing.
yeah, me and daddy
were just fucking playing.
get up there.
yeah, we'll play again.
daddy is okay.
it's all right.
what the fuck
are you looking at?
you stay in the car,
i'll go talk to her.
okay.
hey, chris.
hey, how are you?
hi.
hey.
everything okay?
yeah, i just wanted to
talk to you for a minute.
okay.
i got to get on the ship with
andy and try to fix this.
are you fucking kidding?
what am i going to do,
let him go alone?
no, we're going to
think of something else.
there's nothing
else to do, okay?
i hate to tell you,
but that little
dumb fuck has put us
in the worst
possible position, okay?
and if they don't get the money
from him, they're coming after us.
so what else
do you want me to do?
you know what
i don't want to do?
i don't want to fucking visit you in
jail like we're visiting your dad,
and raising
those kids on my own.
so it's my...
i don't want to fight with
you about this, okay?
i know what i'm doing,
all right?
will you just trust me?
please?
nothing is going to happen.
all right? i promise.
mmm.
<i>that shitbag briggs was
here for a couple of years.</i>
he tried to smash some guy's
head in with a cinder block.
look, i mentioned
this to sebastian.
we're doing another run.
can you get me
on your old boat?
you mean the borden?
remember when you
were little, you and sebastian,
you broke into
mctier's warehouse
stole all that
mardi gras jewelry,
and you came back to the house with
a great big box of them beads?
you thought they were diamonds.
you were grinning like
you just won the fucking lottery.
and you said,
"you don't have to work
on that boat no more."
i always think about that.
the proudest day of my life
was when you turned legit,
and you started your own business,
and you got out of the life.
i know you got to do
what you got to do.
i got it.
family is family.
i'll get you on the boat.
but you get in,
you got to get back out.
me and andy are shipping
out to panama with the borden.
the old man's boat?
yeah, he got us on.
what about captain camp?
i know. i know.
don't worry about it.
what's this?
what's what?
every time i come here,
you got new shit.
i'm getting it together,
i'm getting the place ready.
it's a bad-ass coffee table.
that is not for shoes.
i must be out of touch. i don't
know what's bad-ass any more
because this looks
cheap-ass.
you're turning
into <i>the birdcage.</i>
i mean...
so who do we know in panama?
are you going to go see ruben?
dude, no drugs.
what else has that
kind of profit margin?
edwin is in panama.
currency?
we have to bring back a shit-ton
to make it worth our while.
all right, so i'll
bring back a shit-ton.
okay, 15 million on
four stacks this big.
it's like the size
of a mini cooper.
where are you going to hide it?
that's my problem.
i need the borden's
crew manifest.
oh, god. you got to be
kidding me.
oh, i like tarik mortin. he's a
horrible chef, but he's great on runs.
le cloud's a fucking drunk.
newlywed?
he's not great on runs, but
we've known him a long time.
olaf's solid, we need
somebody in the engine room.
well, it's no a-team,
but it's the best we can do.
come on, work your magic. make
the call, get me a twic card.
hi, sweet pea.
<i>i need you to push through a
twic card for chris farraday.</i>
i got your message. it only took
you three years to call me?
<i>are you back in business?</i>
no, no, no, no, no.
i need something, though.
remember our last run?
the funny money?
<i>i need that exact same shit
by next week, but a lot more.</i>
<i>four times as much.</i>
and we need a van big enough
to transport it, okay?
okay. i'll be here.
come on, mikey!
what's funny money?
huh? nothing. that's
just work stuff for dad.
have you ever been
convicted of espionage?
just answer yes or no, we'll get
through this really quickly.
no.
sedition, or conspiracy to commit
espionage, sedition, treason?
together?
i received your
shipping application, mr...
lakowski.
<i>mr. lakowski.</i>
<i>señor</i> lakowski, i'm getting
you a 20-foot standard dry.
would you like us to load it?
no, i've got somebody to take care of that.
i just need the container.
<i>okay, we'll leave the container</i>
<i>standing by for you
at the port of panama.</i>
<i>and what are you shipping?</i>
a van.
here you go.
it takes money
to make money, baby.
thank you.
don't sink, daddy.
okay, buddy.
you're going to
miss my playoff game.
i know. i'm sorry.
your mom is going to take lots
of pictures for me, okay?

till i get back.

cleaner up to the bridge.

hey!
you're up top.
i get the bottom bunk.
yeah, no kidding.
don't act like
you don't like this shit.
why, is it that obvious?
i love it, but don't
tell your sister.
all right, come on. you can get
your beauty rest later, let's go.
my arm, my arm.
keep an eye out.
hey, someone's coming.

that's a hungry man's appetite.
this is real good.
how you doing, buddy?
what the fuck are
you doing on my ship?
did you even check
the goddamn crew manifest?
how the fuck do you let bud
farraday's spawn aboard my ship?
dhs cleared him. he was
added at the last minute.
all right, i'm demoting
him to ship's boy.
yes, sir.
you scrub dirt and stay
the fuck out of my sight.
otherwise you might
have an accident,
and wind up in the drink.
show him where
the carpet cleaner is.
yes, sir.
oh, man, carpet cleaner.
let's go, rug doctor.
oh, you got promoted? they gave
you some new stripes on there.
i'll be ship's boy. you're
still captain's bitch boy.
yeah, yeah.
okay.
yes, sir.
everybody's drinking tall boys,
and nobody's fucking working.
what's up, man?
are you bringing the captain
in on this or what?
fuck, no.
well, i remember talking to
your pops in this same room.
he said that same shit.
we know how that turned out.
do you trust me or not?
i do. i do.
so what are we running?
a shipping pallet loaded up with
best counterfeit money can buy.
and just how the hell do you think
we're going to stow that much shit?
you worried, buddy?
i mean, where is the faith?
what, i lost my stripes? now
i got to start from scratch?
exactly, that shit's void.
no problem.
come on, i'll show you.
what do you think?
looks good. chris,
you're a crazy fucker.
not bad? huh?
sixty cubic feet.
no fucking way.
no, it's bigger than 60.
ah, shit! yeah, man,
this is much bigger than 60.
we got company.
quick, quick, quick!
hey, what are you doing?
chris, stop!
andy, be quiet in there.
come on, come on!
what the hell
are you doing in here?
i needed a scraper. we noticed
some mold in the lower hull.
the bleach wasn't
cutting it, so...
well, you shouldn't be dicking
around in here. get going.
i was just trying to keep
it clean for you, boss.
hey, chris! chris!
bring it right back up!
come on, you got it!
you got it, come on!
i can't do it.
god damn.
are you getting on?
no.
do you want me to
put you back in the box?
that's not funny.
i could have
suffocated in that box.
"i really could have..."
leave the kid alone, man.
how are you going to
pull this shit off?
we're delivering 300 or
so containers. yeah.
we're picking up 500 or more. we're
not going to be in port that long.
so we got to drive out to chorrillo,
see edwin, load up the bills,
and then drive back
to the boat during rush hour.
it's going to be tight,
but we're going to be good.
it's going to be too tight.
we're cutting it close.
might not have enough time.
we'll buy more time.
controllable pitch propeller.
oh, yeah.
pitch propeller.
can you drain the oil supply?
the hydraulic chamber
won't work.
that's the point, stupid ass.
look.
we can do it while being
towed through the locks.
it will buy us
a couple of hours.
okay?
i don't know.
i hate when we fuck
with the boat.

when we fuck with the boat.
take it easy, big bear.
olaf, fuck with the boat.

it will buy us
a little more time.
hey, michael, look. it's

<i>andy's going to

<i>and you're still gonna have to
come up with the goddamn money.</i>

yeah.
i'm telling you, man.

he's been acting crazy lately,
since he became a boss.

chris, we should
have listened to him.
we got less than an hour to get back to the boat.
it ain't going to work.
it will work.
i mean, do you even know
where gonzalo's warehouse is?

i told you i would
call you with an update.
you've got a few more days left

and stick it up your ass.
and you're asking me,
"is there anything wrong?"
well, i got
something coming in.
you don't sound so sure.
i'm sure.
it's coming in.
flying solo ain't
for sidekicks, abney.
i fucking warned you.
when you first
came to me for help
in keeping your
little business afloat,
i fucking warned you.
i said, "you've got to
know your limitations."
"don't live beyond
your fucking means!"
i don't normally
do this fucking shit.
telling you what's going to
happen when you don't pay.
what's the fucking point?
you know the rules, right?
right.
you take care, abney.
jack, neat
somebody's off the wagon.
i want you to go see kate.

she was your family.
you know, if you want to fuck
his wife, you fuck his wife.
