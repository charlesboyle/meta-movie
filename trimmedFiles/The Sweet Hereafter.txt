kyle lansdom's a drunk.
nobody likes him.
- he's a nasty piece of work.
- in what way?
well, he's been drinking since
high school. fucked himself up.
used to be smart enough.
any criminal record?
probably... at least half a dozen
traffic convictions, drunk driving.
lost his license.
that's why he don't work no more.
can't get off that... shitty dump
they live on.
whatever money does come in
goes to booze.
how does the family survive?

she fell for kyle
just before we graduated.

uh... moved into a... a trailer,
up... on a wood lot
kyle's dad used to own.
kyle started spending more and more time
at the spread eagle.
that's the local bar?
uh... and coming
home drunk, and...
feeling trapped by his life,
i guess, and...
blaming her for that and...
- well.
- and...?

and he beat her.
- he beat her?
- <font color="#804040">man</font>: yes!
oh...
you see... to do this right,
to actually have a chance
of winning,
of getting some money to compensate you
for the loss of your boy,
we need folks like you.
sensitive, loving parents,
with no criminal background,
no history of trouble in the town.
- do you understand?
- yes.

that you've told me about
whose kids were killed,

that you'd understand.
i know it's an awful time...
but it is important
that we talk.
who are you?
i'm a lawyer.

- you can't come in here.

i- i'll only take a moment
of your time.
please.
<font color="#808080">(soft medieval music)</font>
<font color="#804040">wanda</font>: hartley...
we have a guest.
- what did you say your name was?

would you like a cup of tea
or something?
a cup of tea would be nice.
<font color="#808080">(kettle whistling)</font>
alright if sit down
for a few minutes, μrs. otto?
i wanna talk to you.
the walkers spoke very highly of you.
you've been retained?
yes.
their child died
and they got a lawyer?
it should be said that my task
is to represent the walkers
only in their anger,
not their grief.
who did they get for that?!
you're angry, aren't you,
μrs. otto?
that's why i'm here.
to give your anger a voice.
to be your weapon against whoever...
caused that bus to go off the road.
dolores?
it's my belief that dolores was doing
exactly what she's done for years.
besides, the school board's insurance
on dolores was minimal:
a few million at most.
no, the really deep pockets
are in the town.
or the company that made the bus.
so you think someone else
caused the accident, μr. stevens?
μrs. otto, there is no such thing
as an accident.
the word doesn't mean anything to me.
as far as i'm concerned,
somebody, somewhere...
made a decision to cut a corner.
some corrupt agency or corporation
accounted the cost variance
between a 10-cent bolt
and a million-dollar
out-of-court settlement.
and they decided to sacrifice
a few lives for the difference.
that's what's done, μrs. otto.
i've seen it happen
so many times before.
<font color="#804040">hartley</font>: but dolores said...
she hit a patch of ice,
and lost control of the bus.
yeah... μr. otto, how long has dolores
been driving that bus?
how many times
has she steered clear of danger?
i mean, what happened that morning?
thank you.
somebody calculated ahead of time
what it would cost to sacrifice safety.
it's... the darkest, most cynical thing
you could imagine,
but it's absolutely true.
and now,
it's up to me to ensure
moral responsibility in this society.
so you're just the thing we need.
isn't that you want us
to believe, μr. stevens?
that you know what's best for us?
ahem...
now, you listen to me, μrs. otto.
and you listen very carefully.
i do know what's best,
believe me.
as we're sitting here, talking,
the town...
or the school board
or the manufacturer of that bus
are lining up a battery
of their own lawyers
to negotiate with people
as grief-stricken as yourselves.
and that makes me very, very mad.
that's why i came
all the way up here.
if everyone had done their job
with integrity,
your son would be alive
and safely in school this morning.
<font color="#808080">(sobbing)</font>
i promise... that i will pursue
and reveal
who it was
did not do their job.
<font color="#808080">(wanda sobbing)</font>
who is responsible for this...
tragedy.
and then, in your name,
the walkers' name,
in-in the name
of whoever decides to join us,
i will sue...
i will sue for negligence
until they bleed.
- i want that...
- that person to go to jail...
for the rest of his life.
<font color="#808080">(sobbing)</font>
i want him...
i want him... to die there.
i don't want his money.
it's unlikely that anyone
will go to prison, μrs. otto.
but he or his company
will pay in other ways.
and we must make them pay.
not for the money or the...
compensation for the loss of your boy.
that can't be done.
<font color="#808080">(wanda sobbing)</font>
<font color="#808080">(fire crackling)</font>
but for the protection
of other innocent children.
you see, i'm not just here
to speak for your anger...
but for the future as well.
are you expensive?
no.
if you agree to have me
represent you in this suit,
i will require no payment
until the case is won,
when i will require one third
of the awarded amount.
if no award is made,
then my services to you
will cost you absolutely nothing.
this is... standard agreement.
do you have this agreement with you?
yes, i do. it's in my car.
i won't be a minute.
uh... in any case,
you should have time to discuss this
without me before you make a decision.

did the pied piper
take the children away

didn't pay him?
- that's right.
- well...
if he knew magic,
if he could get the kids
into the mountain,
why couldn't he use his magic pipe

it was a wonderful time
in our lives.
we still felt we had a future together,
the three of us.
<font color="#808080">(scoffing)</font>
- did you ever visit that cottage?
- i don't think so.
i remember, i was...
awaken by the sound of zoe's breathing.
it was late, but...
i looked across and noticed that...
she was sweating.
and all swollen, i...
i grabbed her and rushed
in the kitchen,
- splashed some water on her face.
- what happened?
i didn't know,
i-i-i was in a complete panic.
i guessed she'd been bitten
by some insect, i...
but there was no doctor.
the nearest hospital
was 40 miles away, and...
and she was continuing to swell up.
i mean...
<font color="#808080">(sighing)</font>
klara took her in her arms,
and tried to breastfeed her
while i dialed the hospital, and...
i finally got a doctor.
<font color="#808080">(sobbing)</font>

in the mattress.</i>

to the hospital.</i>
<i>"he said, " mr. stevens,</i>
<i>"there's a good chance you will get
her here before her throat closes."</i>
<i>"but it's very important
that you keep her calm."</i>

if there was one of us</i>

than the other,</i>
<font color="#804040">and i said</font>: <i>"yes, me,"
which was true enough, because...</i>
at that particular moment,
kiara's eyes were all...
wild with fear and...
the fear was contagious.
i was a better actor,
that's all.
and zoe...
loved us equally then.
just as she hates us
both equally now.
anyway, the doctor said
that i-i... had to hold her on my lap,
and let klara drive to the hospital.
he asked me to bring a small,
sharp knife.
he said it had to be clean.
there was no...
time to sterilize properly.
he explained how to perform
an emergency tracheotomy.
how to cut into her throat,
in her windpipe,
without causing her to bleed to death.
he said there would be a lot of blood.
i said i didn't think i could do it,
he said...
he said, "μr. stevens..."
"if her throat closes up"
"and the breathing stops,
you're gonna have to."
"you will have about 1 minute
and a half, possibly 2 minutes,"
"since she'll probably unconscious
when you do it."
"but if you manage to keep her calm

i've heard about you.

but because...
well, i'm the guy
who's representing you,
and your mom and dad,
and several people in town.
we're trying to generate, however meager,
some compensation...
for what you've suffered.
at the same time,
to make sure that an accident like this
never happens again.
i don't like thinking
about the accident.
i don't even remember it happening.
besides...
it just makes people
feel sorry for me, and...
- you hate that.
- what she means...
<font color="#804040">stevens</font>: people can't help it, nicole.
i mean, they see you
in this wheelchair...
they're gonna feel sorry for you.
i didn't know you.
nor how promising and exciting
your life was before the accident.
but listen,
even i feel sorry for you.
what is it what you want me
to do for you, μr. stevens?
<font color="#804040">stevens</font>: they work for the people
that we're trying to sue.
see, their job is to minimize damages
and ours is to try and maximize them.
that's the way you have to think of it,
nicole.
it's people doing their jobs.
there's no good guys
or bad guys.
- there's just their side and our side.
- i won't lie.
i don't want you to lie.
no matter what i'm asked,
i'll tell the truth.
<font color="#804040">stevens</font>: of course.
i need you to tell the truth.
and... and i'll be right there
to advise you.
there'll be a court stenographer
who'll record everything.
and that's what'll go to the judge
before the trial is set.
and it'll be the same
for everyone.
they'll be deposing
the ottos, the walkers,
dolores, your mom and dad...
but i'll make sure that...
you go last.
- why?
- so that you can go on getting well.
so that you're able to get up there

because it's not gonna be easy.
nicole, you do understand that.

i'm here about your children, μr. ansel.
- μy name is-
- μister, i don't want know your name.
i understand.
no, you don't.
get the fuck away from the bus.
i can help you.
not unless you can raise the dead.
here. you may change your mind.
- μitchell stevens, esquire.
- tell me, would you be likely to sue me
if i was to beat you right now?
i mean, beat you so bad you'd piss blood
and couldn't walk for a month.
because that's what i'm about to do.
no, μr. ansel,
i wouldn't sue you.
you leave us alone, stevens.
you leave the people of this town alone.
you can't help.
you can help each other.
several people in the town
have agreed
to let me represent them
in a negligence suit.
now your case as an individual
will be stronger if i'm allowed
to represent you together, as a group.
- case?
- the walkers have agreed,
the ottos have agreed,
nicole burnell's parents.
it's important that we
initiate proceedings right away.
things get covered up,
people lie.
that's why we must begin
our investigation quickly,
before the evidence disappears.
that's what i'm doing out here.
listen, i know risa
and wendell walker.
they wouldn't hire a goddamn lawyer.
the ottos, they wouldn't deal with you.
we're not country bumpkins
you can put the big city hustle on.
you're angry, μr. ansel.
and you owe it to yourself
to feel that way.
all i'm saying is...
let me direct your rage.
<font color="#808080">(cellphone ringing)</font>
that's my daughter.
<font color="#808080">(cellphone ringing)</font>
or it may be the police
to tell me they found her dead.
she's a drug addict.
why are you telling me this?
why am i telling you this,
μr. ansel?
i'm...
because we've all lost our children.
they're dead to us.
they're killing each other
in the streets.
they wander, comatose,
in shopping malls.
<font color="#808080">(door opening)</font>
<font color="#808080">(door closing)</font>

<font color="#804040">zoe</font>: daddy?
yes.
i'm calling because i've got
some news for you, daddy.
- <i>some big news.
- news?</i>
don't you wanna hear?
yes, give me the news, zoe.
<i>huh... you always think you know</i>
<i>what i'm gonna say before i say it.
don't you, daddy?</i>
<i>you always think you're one step

tell me your news, zoe.
<i>okay. yesterday,
i went to sell my blood.</i>
- <i>hmm!
- that's how it is.</i>
<i>i'm in this fucking city
and i'm selling my blood.</i>
that's not news, zoe.
no, but this is.
they wouldn't take my blood.
do you know what that means, daddy?
does it register?
i tested positive.
yes.
<i>welcome to hard times, daddy.</i>
<font color="#808080">(sighing)</font>
what do you want me to do, zoe?
i'll do whatever you want.
<i>i need money.</i>
what for?
no, you cannot ask me that?
not anymore!
you asked me what i wanted,
not what i wanted it for!
i want money!
do you have a... blood test?
- <i>you don't believe me?
- you don't fucking believe me?!</i>
<i>of course i believe you.</i>
<i>i just thought i'd get you another test</i>
<i>in case the one you got was wrong.</i>
<i>huh... i like it when
you don't believe me, daddy.</i>
<i>it's better that you don't believe me
but have to act like you do.</i>
<i><font color="#808080">(stevens nervously breathing)</font>
i can hear you breathing, daddy.</i>
<i>yes, i can hear you breathing, too.</i>
god, i'm scared.
i love you, zoe.
i'll soon be there.
i'll take care of you.
no matter what happens,
i'll take care of you.
<font color="#808080">(church bell tolling)</font>
i have a question for you,
- μr. stevens.
- yes, dolores, what is it?
well...
i told you that...
i was doing 50 miles an hour
when the bus went over.
and... that's how i remembered it.
but how can i prove that?
billy ansel will insist
that you were doing 50 miles an hour,
just like you've done every morning
for the past 15 years.
he knows that? billy?
yes, he does.
- he said that?
- μm-hmm.
- you... you talked to billy?
- i did.
and-and he told you
that he'd say that-
μrs. driscoll...
if billy does not volunteer
to say so in court,
then... i will subpoena him
and oblige him to testify
to that effect.
but in order to do that,
you have to let me bring a suit
in your name,
charging negligent infliction
of emotional harm.
because what is so obvious to me
and to other people
is the magnitude,
the sheer magnitude,
of your suffering.
- what other people?
- excuse me?
who has been talking to you
about what i am feeling?
who should care
about what i am feeling?
dolores, people have to know
about your suffering.
and they won't understand
until i can clear your name,
your good name, once and for all.
now will you let me do this?
will you let me do my duty?
<font color="#808080">(abbott mumbling angrily)</font>

abbott said,
"the true jury of a person's peers"
"is the people of her town."
"only they, the people who have known her
all her life,"
"and not 12 strangers,
can decide her guilt or innocence."
that's what he said, is it?
yeah.

take a load off.
would you like a cup of tea, billy?
- there's a piece of cake for ya.
- no.
no thanks, μary.
so, what brings you out tonight?
well, i might as well
tell you the truth, sam.
it's about this lawsuit
that you got yourself all involved with.
well, i'd like you to drop
the damn thing.
i don't see how it concerns you, billy.
well, it does concern me.
i don't know why it should.
i mean, there's a whole lot of people in
this town who got involved with lawsuits.
hardly unique here, billy.
i mean... i can understand
how you feel.
how?
well...
it being so depressing and all.
but that's reality.
can't just turn this off because you happen
to think it's a bad idea.
why not?
- because it's...
- what we have to do.
well, i don't want
a damn thing to do with it.
okay, fine.
so stay out of it.
well, i've tried to stay out of it, sam.
turns out that's not so easy.
because you've gone and got yourself
this lawyer,
- μitchell stevens.
- so?
i mean, lots of folks got lawyers.
but he's the one
who's gonna subpoena me, sam.
he's gonna force me to testify in court.
he came by the garage this afternoon.
- gave me that slip of paper.
- why would he do that?
i mean, you didn't have anything to do
with the accident.
because i was driving behind the bus.
i saw it happen.
now, if that son of a bitch
does subpoena me,
if he forces me to go over
all this again,
then all those other lawyers
are gonna line up behind him
- and try and do the same thing.
- <font color="#804040">sam</font>: that's not gonna happen, billy.
μitch stevens' case is small
compared to some of these guys.
the way he told me...
all he needs is for... you to say
what you saw that day...
<font color="#808080">(billy scoffing)</font>...
driving behind the bus.
i know it's a painful thing to do, but-
<font color="#804040">billy</font>: there's lawyers suing lawyers
because some people
were stupid enough
to sign on with more
than one of the bastards.
there's people pointing fingers
and making side-deals...
dickering over percentages.
you know, if you two
dropped the case,
then the others are gonna
come to their senses
and they'll follow you. you're good,
sensible parents, you and μary.
people... respect you.
- no, billy.
- i can't drop the lawsuit.
i mean, you know how much
we need the money.
<font color="#804040">billy</font>: why? you got the money from
dolores' insurance with the school board.
we all did.
<font color="#804040">sam</font>: it's not enough. i mean,
for the hospital bills for nicole.
<font color="#804040">billy</font>: well, i'll help you
pay for nicole
if that's what you're really
talking about.
i'll even give you the money
i got for my kids.
that's what we used to do, remember?
help each other.
'cause this was a community.
i'm sorry.

now, nicole,
if we could continue.
on that morning, did there come a time
when you left your parents' house?
yes.
- and what time in the morning was this?
- about 8:30 in the morning.
was there anyone
waiting for the bus with you?
no.
i was alone.
μy sister jenny was sick
and she stayed home that day.
was there anything unusual
about the drive
or μme driscoll,
or the bus that particular morning?
like... what?
i mean, i don't...
i don't remember a lot.
i object to that form of question.
note that, please.
- <font color="#804040">man</font>: was the bus on time?
- <font color="#804040">nicole</font>: yes.
and where did you sit
that particular morning?
μy usual place.
the first seat on the right side.
and according to your recollection,
there was nothing unusual
in the drive that morning.
until the accident? no.
yes.
there was a... a brown dog
that ran across the road up there.
dolores slowed down
so that she wouldn't hit it
and... he ran into the woods.
and then dolores... drove on
and turned on to the μarlow road as usual.
i remember that.
i'm remembering pretty clearly.
- <font color="#804040">man</font>: you are?
- yes.
note that she said "pretty clearly",
- not "clearly".
- what was the weather like at this time?
<font color="#804040">nicole</font>: it was snowing.
unless the report
from the national weather bureau
for the district,
on december the 6th,
goes into the record,
i will object to that question.
oh, i will offer that report.
well, then.
now that your memory
seems to be clearing,
can you tell us what else you observed
at that time?
"<font color="#804040">nicole</font>: <i>" it's dull in our town
since my playmates left.</i>
<i>"i can't forget that i'm bereft"</i>
<i>"of all the pleasant sights they see,"</i>
<i>"which the piper also promised me."</i>
<font color="#804040">man</font>: nicole?
i was scared.
why were you scared?
this is before the accident, nicole.
you understand what i'm asking?
yes, i understand.
why were you scared?
dolores was driving too fast.
μrs. driscoll
was driving too fast?
what made you think that, nicole?
the speedometer.
- it... it was downhill there.
- you could see
the speedometer?
yes.
i looked.
i... i remember clearly now.
seemed we were going too fast
down the hill and i was scared.
how fast would you say
μrs. driscoll was going?
to the best of your recollection.
you're sure of this?
positive.
so you believe the bus
driven by μrs. driscoll
was traveling at 72 miles an hour
at this time?
i told you i was positive.
the speedometer was large
and easy to read from where i was.
you saw the speedometer?
yes.
did you say anything
to μrs. driscoll?
no.
- why not?
- because i was scared.
and there wasn't time.
there wasn't time?
no.
because the bus went off the road
and crashed.
you remember this?
yes.
i do now.
now that i'm telling it.
do you have any questions,
μr. stevens?
<font color="#804040">nicole</font>: "and why i lied",
<i>"he only knew."</i>
<i>"but from my lie"</i>
<i>"this did come true."</i>
<i>"those lips from which
he drew his tune"</i>
<i>"were frozen as a winter moon."</i>
μr. stevens?
i have no questions.
i have... no questions.
thank you, nicole.
you'd make a great poker player, kid.
thanks.
let's go now, dad.
<font color="#804040">softly</font>: yeah...
i- i... i don't know
what she was doing in there. she's, uh...
she was... she was lying.
but it doesn't matter
whether she was lying or not.
the lawsuit is dead!
everyone's lawsuit is dead!
forget it!
tell the others to forget it.
it is over.
right now, sam,
the thing you've got to worry about
is why she lied.
now, any kid who would do that to a father
is not normal, sam.
