<i>this is the persian empire...</i>
<i>...known today as iran.</i>
<i>for 2500 years, this land was ruled
by a series of kings...</i>
<i>...known as shahs.</i>
<i>in 1950, the people of iran elected
mohammad mosaddegh...</i>
<i>...a secular democrat, as prime minister.</i>
<i>he nationalized british and u.s.
petroleum holdings...</i>
<i>...returning iran's oil to its people.</i>
<i>but in 1953...</i>
<i>...the u.s. and great britain engineered
a coup die-tat that deposed mosaddegh...</i>
<i>...and installed reza pahlavi as shah.</i>
<i>the young shah was known
for opulence and excess.</i>
<i>his wife was rumored to bathe in milk...</i>
<i>...while the shah had his lunches
flown in by concorde from paris.</i>
<i>the people starved.</i>
<i>the shah kept power through his ruthless
internal police:</i>
<i>the savak.</i>
<i>an era of torture and fear began.</i>
<i>he then began a campaign
to westernize iran...</i>
<i>...enraging a mostly traditional shiite
population.</i>
<i>in 1979, the people of iran
overthrew the shah.</i>
<i>the exiled cleric, ayatollah khomeini,
returned to rule iran.</i>
<i>it descended into score-settling,
death squads and chaos.</i>
<i>dying of cancer,
the shah was given asylum in the u.s.</i>
<i>the iranian people took to the streets
outside the u.s. embassy...</i>
<i>...demanding that the shah be returned...</i>
<i>...tried...</i>
<i>...and hanged.</i>
based on a true story.
u.s. embassy, iran - november 4, 1979

<i>they need an hour to burn the classified.</i>
i need you to hold.
if you shoot one person, they're gonna kill
every single one of us in here.
i'm telling you,
if we're going to go, we need to go now.
- okay, we need to make a decision...
- can we wait until the iranian police come?
no, the police aren't coming.
it's been 45 minutes.
- how do you know?
- the police have abandoned their posts.
if the police are not coming,
then the army's gonna come.
the prime minister won't let
the embassy be taken over.
the prime minister may come tomorrow, but the
komiteh are here today. so we have to evacuate.
look at me. no one is coming.
get the desk drawers. everything.
don't sort it.
get it down to the incinerator in the vault!
go, now!
tear gas as a last resort only.
<i>i repeat: only if your life is under threat.</i>
in here, we are in america right now.
outside, we are in iran.
- it's on american soil...
- i'm not going out into that.
they're not safe here.
if they get caught applying for visas
to the u.s.?
mark, we are in the only building
with direct access to the street.
- if we're going to go, then we need to go now.
- yeah, i'm in.
- yeah.
- yeah, let's go.
- i'm going outside.
- why?
to reason with them.
open the door!

iranians go first.
now, hurry!
who has made this?!
it's done. they're in.
okay, come on.
we gotta get off the streets.
this way. up here to the left.
- these fucks hit us, we can't hit them back?
- mosaddegh, we did it to them first.
state department - 7th floor
you think the soviets would put up with this shit?
they'd invade.
we helped the guy torture
and de-ball an entire population.
- how many were there?
- at least 50. we're not sure.
- schafer!
- you still haven't found schafer?
no, i was screaming his name
because i was fucking him.
canadian ambassadors residence, tehran
come in.
<i>it's confirmed, sir. six escaped.</i>
<i>- i was told five.
- no, sir, apparently it's six.</i>
- what happened?
- not clear. we know they escaped.
secretary of states office
- where are they?
- the canadian ambassador's house.
- do they stay put? are we attempting rescue?
- hold for the secretary of state.
yes. is white house joining?
they claim the embassy
was a den of espionage.
we wish it was.
we wish it was.
white house, chief of staffs office
ci's got three people over there, they don't see a
revolution coming?
white house, chief of staff's office
- call it something other than intelligence.
- hold for the chief of staff.
- hodding.
- i'll call him back.
they're sticking.
no release till we expel the shah.
- put him on a plane, then. fuck him.
- he's half-dead and he's in chemo.
we took him in. he's ours now.
great, so we'll take in any prick
as long as he's got cancer?
no, just the pricks on our side.
so all our other pricks on their prick thrones
know when they get thrown out on a rail...
...they won't get their fucking spleens
taken out by some camel vet in sinai.
what about the six
who are with the canadians?
we've got 60 in the embassy with guns
to their heads right now.
the whole world is watching the embassy.
they're safer than the six on the street.
banisadr's saying it'll be over
in 24 hours.
we leave the six where they are.
i'll go brief the president.
all right, let's get to it.
<i>so far official comments about
the incident have been a model of restraint.</i>
a story is a story until people believe it.
and then that story is called the truth.
and the truth now is,
according to the white house...
...that 50 americans are prisoners
in a 6th-century shithole...
...because this agency
missed the warning signs.
so now a subcommittee
wants congressional oversight.
apparently, they wanna see
what they're buying.
i'm a covert exfiltration officer, sir.
if they see what i'm doing,
i'm not doing my job.
well, the director's upstairs right now...
...sipping a lemon water,
crossing out 800 names.
that's not a story, that's the truth.
exfiltration readiness freezes
until further notice.
and if assets require it?
then we're not responsible.
what you're responsible for
is to sit at your desk...
...keep your mouth shut
and do your fucking job.
can i count on you to do that?
mostly we're gonna miss kicking his ass
in the office pool, but again...
this is the last white tiger right here.
he's a good man.
he's got a shitty drive swing,
but he's a good man. heh. heh, heh.
god bless. i... i just wanna say to mikey...
well, first of all, good luck doing less
in retirement than you did at work.
when you're fishing
down in the everglades...
- ...trying to catch your next ex-wife...
- ooh.
...don't you forget us at langley.
twenty-seven years this man
gave his country.
you know what this says.
this is a great american right here.
give the outfit 27 years,
they give you a trinket with a bird on it.
yeah, i just wanna say that,
yeah, we're gonna miss him.
he's... the red menace...
my dad was a steelworker, local 43.
when me and my brother were young,
he'd take us to the chrysler building and say:
"look at that. your dad built that."
you're supposed to be out in the country.
she wanted more time to think.
what are you telling the kid?
- i wanna thank everybody.
- he's smart. he knows.
but i don't wanna stand here
without taking a moment...
...for our 50 men and women
who can't come home, so...
<i>iran's revolutionary guard
has rounded up a gang of terrorists...</i>
<i>...blamed for one murder of a half-dozen
followers of ayatollah khomeini.</i>
<i>it says security at khomeini's home
now has been tightened.</i>
<i>this, by the way, is the 69th day that the
american hostages have been held in tehran.</i>
<i>there is no change reported
in the hostage situation.</i>
<i>in this country, george meany died
last night. he was 85 years old.</i>
yeah.
yes.
what?
<i>to begin with, of course...</i>
<i>...we wanted to learn about the hostages
held in the american embassy compound.</i>
<i>they may not understand what
their ordeal means to their countrymen.</i>
<i>but this nation, their nation, is outraged.</i>
c.i.a. headquarters, virginia
<i>and we cannot really know what it is like inside the prison
that was once our embassy.</i>
<i>and we cannot really know what it is like
inside the prison that was once our embassy.</i>
<i>actions of iran
have shocked the civilized world.</i>
<i>our embassy has been seized...</i>
<i>...and more than 60 american citizens
continue to be held as hostages.</i>
<i>the situation in iran this morning
is unchanged in regard to the hostages.</i>
<i>nbc's situation in iran has changed,
however.</i>
- is he back there?
- office.
what happened?
the six of them went out a back exit.
brits turned them away,
kiwis turned them away.
canadians took them in.
traffic calls them "the houseguests."
they haven't left the canadian
ambassador's house since it happened.
- why didn't we get them 10 weeks ago?
- too dangerous.
you got revolutionary guards going
door-to-door like jehovah's witnesses.
half of them think that khomeini's been
too lenient on the ones in the embassy.
what about the white house?
carter's shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.
the canadians are done.
they say they're bearing
too much risk. their
foreign secretary corners
vance in brussels...
...and told him she wants
the six of them out.
- who else knows?
- just the families.
meanwhile, some genius in our embassy
was keeping a mug book...
- ...on everybody who worked there.
- jesus christ.
we think it got shredded
before they got in.
but now the bastards are using sweatshop
kids to reassemble the shreds.
and once they reassemble that book
they'll know six americans got out.
and they'll know what they look like.
standing room only
for beheadings in the square.
- who's handling?
- state is coordinating in-house.
state?
- they don't do exfils.
- they do now.
they want to run it by us,
strictly as consultants.
engell says it's a lose-lose.
these people die, they die badly. publicly.
state wants the blame, we'll give it to them.
what does he want me here for?
so he can tell state
he ran it by his best exfil guy.
okay.
this is bob pender from state o.s.
he's been talking to morgan at extaff.
- bob?
- thank you.
all right.
mark and cora lijek.
<i>twenty-nine and 25. he's a consular officer,
she's an assistant.</i>
<i>newlyweds. they only just got there
a couple months ago.</i>
no language skills or in-country knowledge.
henry lee schatz.
agricultural attachÃ© from idaho.
<i>a bit of an oddball, apparently.</i>
<i>he was there to sell
u.s. tractors to iranian agro.</i>
joe stafford. late 20s.
<i>he's smart and a climber.</i>
<i>speaks farsi.</i>
<i>he arranged the hire of his wife, kathy.</i>
embassy was understaffed,
so the faculty wives were the typing pool.
and bob anders. senior consular officer...
<i>...oldest of the group
and most likely to be group leader.</i>
they're in hiding at the canadian
ambassadorâ€™s residence.
fortunately, we do not believe the iranians
are aware the six have escaped.
so, what we like for this are bicycles.
we've identified back roads
from the shemiran district.
a couple of rat lines
through the mountains...
...to the crossing near tabriz.
cars are off the table
because of the roadblocks.
we wait till the weather clears up...
...then deliver the six bikes, provide them
with maps to the turkish border.
we have intelligence they can ride bicycles.
or we're prepared to send in
somebody to teach them.
or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with gatorade.
tony.
it's 300 miles to the turkish border.
they'd need a support team
following them with a tire pump.
we were just asked to sharpshoot this.
state is handling the op.
i'm sorry, who is this?
tony's an exfil spesh. he got a lot
of the shah's people out after the fall.
sir, if these people can read or add...
...pretty soon they're gonna figure out
they're six short of a full deck.
it's winter. you can't
afford to wait around till
spring so it's nice enough
to take a bike ride.
the only way out of that city is the airport.
build new cover identities for them...
...you send in a moses,
he takes them out on a commercial flight.
- we've explored those options.
- they'll never get past airport control.
- komiteh own the place.
- they could pose as reporters.
- the government issued 70-something...
- seventy-four.
...visas for american journalists.
the revolutionary guards
keep them on 74 leashes.
if they're caught with fake journalist creds,
it's peter jennings' head in a noose in an hour.
north american accents
gives us limited options.
so we get the canadians
to issue them passports.
what about english teachers
at the international school?
it's a good idea, but that school's been
closed for eight months.
okay, so how about the do-gooders?
six canadians have been over there inspecting
crops, making sure the kids get enough to eat.
we give them creds,
makes them look like ag ngos.
it's a feed the kids thing. okay?
those kids are black.
those are african kids.
- we get ethnically appropriate kids.
- are there starving kids in iran?
i'm sure there's some skinny kids
in iran, so...
- what about missionaries?
- a logo with seeds. call it "seeds of hope."
hold on.
sir, do you have this newspaper in front
of you? would you mind taking a look at it?
what's in this picture?
- tehran.
- right. what's on the ground?
- snow.
- right.
so, what crops are the do-gooders
inspecting under frosty?
sir, exfils are like abortions.
you don't wanna need one...
...but when you do, you don't do it yourself.
you have a better plan?
no, sir.
<i>whatever
the conflicting signals from iran today...</i>
<i>...and for that matter, every day...</i>
<i>...about whether the hostages will
or will not be tried as spies...</i>
<i>...the government of the united states
has not deviated from its basic demand:</i>
<i>the hostages must be freed.</i>
...claims to defend human rights,
it not only does not defend them...
...it violates them for all nations.
<i>we demand extradition...</i>
<i>we demand extradition...</i>
u.s. embassy, tehran
<i>...of a man who, for more than 37 years,
with the united states' support...</i>
<i>...has killed months-old babies
in the arms of their mothers.</i>
<i>he said if the americans try
military force to rescue the hostages...</i>
<i>...the students will kill them all
and blow up the embassy.</i>
<i>americans were outraged at iran
and anyone iranian.</i>
<i>before that decision was taken,
there was a demonstration in houston.</i>
<i>an iranian flag was burned...</i>
<i>when anti-iranian demonstrators
gathered near the iranian consulate.</i>
<i>... also is what led to a decision
to scrutinize the visas of iranians...</i>
they knew exactly what was going to happen.
they knew.
but i don't understand
what they should do now.
send him back,
just to be tortured and killed?
i don't think that justice is the worst thing.
<i>when did people first tell you that torture
was going on in iran?</i>
<i>they would never come to me and say,
"well, sir, we have tortured this fellow."</i>
<i>president sadat of egypt,
he calls you, imam...</i>
<i>forgive me, his words, not mine.</i>
<i>...a lunatic.</i>
why didn't he have a choice?
why do you think he didn't have a choice?
he would've been referred to as a barbarian.
that's why they're saying
that their current regime...
the shah did more for women's rights...
i think you'd better...
please, everyone, get into the crawlspace.
<i>at one point,
the mob cornered one of the iranians.</i>
<i>when he tried to protect himself,
this is what happened.</i>
<i>just hit him again!</i>
<i>we're not gonna take it anymore!
we're sick of it!</i>
<i>america!</i>
<i>even in our little community here, i mean,
people are drawn up tight, they're tense.</i>
<i>they shouldn't even let those students
in that embassy there.</i>
<i>just shoot a couple of them,
show them we mean business.</i>
<i>i'm mad as hell.</i>
<i>i'm like the guy screaming on that movie
program in network, you know? i've had it.</i>
<i>and if need be, i'll bear arms again.</i>
<i>men who served in vietnam
for what they believed was right are angry.</i>
<i>they're outlaws,

wednesday, january 16th, 1980.</i>
<i>- hello?
- - buddy man.</i>
i'll get mom.
i'm looking for you.
<i>- did you do your homework tonight?
- yeah.</i>
<i>- good man. what are we watching?
- battlestar galactica.</i>
<i>- what channel is it on?
- five.</i>
all right. catch me up.
it's the best show in the world.
first thing, the bad guys are called cylons.
<i>the metal guys, right?</i>
- now, who's the guy with the cape?
- that's starbuck.
<i>he shoots at cylons and he always wins.</i>
who's the little dog guy?
he's not a dog, he's a dagget,
and his name's muffet.
<i>no, dad. that's star wars.</i>
ian, i asked you
to turn the tv off 40 minutes ago.
<i>hang up the phone.
i need to talk to your dad.</i>
<i>let's get out of here!</i>
<i>- - tony? yeah.
- hello.</i>
you know, when you keep him up at night...
...he falls asleep at school.
i'm sorry. i don't...
i miss him.
well, we can figure out a time
for you to come see him.
i miss you too.
i know.
uh...
bye.
you there?
<i>this is the hill
my forefathers used to speak about.</i>
okay. all right, we really have to
get started here.
our ne's work something up on this?
david?
they would pose as teachers
from the international school.
we went through all that. it's boarded up.
- suppose the airport guards don't know that.
suppose.
suppose heckle and jeckle
go over and save them.
hi. sorry.
have a seat, tony.
they're a canadian film crew
on a location scout for a science-fiction movie.
<i>star wars, star trek, whatever it is.
they need an exotic place to shoot.</i>
moonscape, mars, desert, you know.
we put it out there...
the canadian producers put it out there.
...that we're looking at egypt, istanbul.
then we go to the consulate and say,
"hey, we wanna look at iran too."
i fly into tehran, we all fly out together
as a film crew. done.
flamboyant cover identities should be avoided,
as it increases operational visibility.
this is more plausible than foreigners
who wanna go be teachers in iran.
you wanna blend in with the population,
you don't look like a rodeo clown.
just gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and be in the movie business?
we already have credentials
for the teachers.
- no, sir, we have a contact in l.a.
- chambers.
john chambers.
he's a hollywood prosthetics guy.
he's got an oscar, he
did planet of the apes.
did a bunch of contract
work for us in the past.
i go see him, he sets us up.
one, two days, make it look real.
i went outside for 30 seconds. could you
give me a break? i can't breathe in this house.
- i need some fresh air. i can't breathe.
- stay inside the fucking house.
- who saw me go outside? i'm just curious.
- that's not the point, bob.
- it doesn't matter who saw you go out.
- did you see me?
- no.
- i did, okay? i saw you.
bob, it only takes one second
for them to spot you.
some americans are missing.
look at the repaired list of embassy employees.
the numbers don't match.
finish assembling the pictures from the embassy.
all i need is their faces and i will find them.
yes, sir, it will be done.
we want you to go to l.a.
if you can make the movie thing credible,
we'll take you to the director.
don't fuck up.
the whole country is watching you.
they just don't know it.

what the fuck, brian?
- cut.
- we're cutting.
- what an idiot.
- it really hurt.
i'm sorry.

is too tight, so he can't act.
if he could act, he wouldn't
be playing the minotaur.
mr. chambers?
kevin harkins.
hey, tony.
watch your head.
what are you shooting?
monster movie.
yeah? any good?
target audience will hate it.
who's the target audience?
people with eyes.
talk to me.
it's an exfil.
from where?
worst place you can think of.
universal city.
how are you gonna get into the embassy?
they're not in the embassy.
during the takeover, six people escaped.
they're hiding out in tehran.
- and that's who i'm gonna go get.
- what am i making?
i need you to help me make a fake movie.
heh. you came to the right place.
i wanna set up a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.
- that we're not gonna make.
- no.
so you wanna come to hollywood
and act like a big shot?
- without actually doing anything?
- no.
you'll fit right in.
let's see.
well, this one's got an m.a. in english.
she should be your screenwriter.
sometimes they go along on scouts
because they want the free meals.
here's your director.
can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?
you can teach a rhesus monkey
to be a director in a day.
look, if you're gonna do this,
you gotta do it.
the kho-maniacs are froot loops,
but they got cousins...
...who sell prayer rugs
and eight-tracks on la brea.
you can't build cover stories
around a movie that doesn't exist.
you need a script. you need a producer.
- make me a producer.
- no.
you're an associate producer at best.
<i>if you're gonna do a $20 million
star wars rip-off...</i>
...you need somebody who's a somebody

somebody respectable.
with credits.
who you can trust

who'll produce a fake movie.
for free.
hi. i only got a couple of minutes.
i'm getting a lifetime achievement award.
<i>- mazel tov, lester.

i'd rather stay home and count
the wrinkles on my dog's balls.
okay, you got six people hiding out
in a town of, what, 4 million people...
...all of whom chant "death to america"
all the livelong day.
you want to set up a movie in a week.
you want to lie to hollywood,
a town where everybody lies for a living.
then you're gonna sneak 007 over here...
...into a country that wants cia blood
on their breakfast cereal...
...and you're gonna walk the brady bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.
past about a hundred militia
at the airport. that's right.
right.
look, i gotta tell you.
we did suicide missions in the army
that had better odds than this.
sir, the car is here.
you ever think, lester,
how this is all for the cameras?
well, they're getting the ratings,
i'll say that for...
we're gonna need a script.
here, come on, come on, come on.
- no, it's fine.
- stop.
okay.
i love you.
sahar, how are you doing?
fine, thank you.
your friends from canada, ma'am.
all this time. they never go out.
sahar knows.
<i>how about the horses of achilles?</i>
no good. nobody does westerns anymore.
- it's ancient troy.
- if it's got horses in it, it's a western.
hey, kenny, please.
yeah, it's john chambers,
about the office space.
it doesn't matter. it's a fake movie.
if i'm doing a fake movie,
it's gonna be a fake hit.

in this business. $0...

up like a carny ride.
one month, yeah.
- who are you again?
- kevin harkins. studio six films.
he's the money.

you want me to be honest with you, les?
no. i would like you to bullshit me, max.
all right.

they're screaming for sci-fi.
they're offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.
well, what can i say?
congratulations.
but, see, it kind of worries me,
what you said, and let me tell you why.
couple of weeks ago, i was sitting at
trader vic's, i was enjoying a mai tai...
...when my pal warren beatty comes in.
he wishes me well, we had a little chat.
<i>seems he was attached
to star in zulu empire...</i>
...which was gonna anchor that mgm slate.
but warren confided in me
that the picture's gone over budget...
...because the zulu extras wanna unionize.
they may be cannibals,
but they want health and dental...
...so the movie's kaput.
which means that the mgm deal
ain't gonna happen...
...and your script ain't worth
the buffalo shit on a nickel.
so the way it looks to me...
through the cataracts, i grant you.
...is that you can either sign here...
...and take $10,000
for your toilet paper script...
...or you can go fuck yourself.
with all due respect.
you really know warren beatty?
yes, i do. i took a leak next to him
once at the golden globes.
taco?
got any kids, lester?
yeah. i have two daughters.
you see them much?
i talk to them once a year.
- maybe.
- why is that?
i was a terrible father.
the bullshit business,
it's like coal mining.
you come home to your wife and kids,
you can't wash it off.
you?
yeah, i got a son.
he lives in virginia with his mother.
you're divorced?
taking time off.
he needs to be, you know...
...where he is.
kids need the mother.
<i>so tell me what's happening now.</i>
dad, just turn on the tv.
i don't have the same channels
where i am, bud.
you gotta explain it to me.
there are these giant spiders,
and they're attacking all these people.
and these people have to fight
the giant spiders.
they're scared. they can't fight a spider.
<i>the thing about the spiders is,
they're from an inter-dimensional gateway.</i>
what is that? like a black hole?
yes, it is a black hole. i know all about it.
they caught the shah's chief of security
trying to get on a plane to paris.
<i>listen.</i>
since the incident, the number of guards
at the airport has doubled.
thorough background examinations
should be expected.
the movie cover isn't strong enough yet.
i need another week, jack.
you don't have it.
we got an office.
we got business cards.
we got a poster.
if i'm the revolutionary guard,
that's nothing we couldn't have made at home.
six people's lives depend on this.
it's not enough. if we're gonna fool
these people, it has to be big.
and it has to have something
that says it's authentic.
i did a movie with rock hudson one time.
if you wanna sell a lie...
you get the press to sell it for you.
no, no, no. press event and then
they're gonna read through the script.
well, they got a bunch of actors,
they're gonna read from beginning to end.
they have costumes and everything.
no, no, no, i can't.
variety has an exclusive on that.
is there any way to make this
more middle eastern?
mesopotamia? egypt?
iran.
look, i can get you in, but you're
gonna have to promise me at least half a page.
no, no, this thing's an event.
it's gonna be a spectacle.
- lester?
- nina. you look fabulous.
you're doing the reading?
i'm playing serksi, the galactic witch.
great. i'll call you.
keep that fucking space witch
away from me.
- you know her?
- i was married to her.
oh, my god, iraq is amazing.
oh, we're shooting in iran.
iran with an n?
yeah. we're very excited.
you ever watch the news?
what does the title refer to?
the argo. you know, it's the thing.
like jason and the golden fleece,
or what?
no, no. it's the ship. it's the spaceship.
it goes everywhere.
it goes all throughout space.
so it's the argonaut.
no.
- what does "argo" mean?
- i don't know.
you don't know?
it means "argo fuck yourself."
excuse me. may i have
your attention, ladies and gentlemen?
if our artists could settle in.
we're just about ready to begin the reading.
argo, by mary ann boyd.
"fade in on starship landing.
exterior, bazaar.
an exotic, middle eastern vibe."
<i>the people working here are not diplomats.</i>
<i>in fact, as imam khomeini said...</i>
<i>...we have found no evidence that proves
that these people are diplomats.</i>
<i>all evidence proves
that these people are spies.</i>
in the name of god,
the beneficent, the merciful...
...our message to the awakened peoples
of the world:
at this time we want
to expose the hateful acts...
our world has changed.
the fire of hope stopped burning
in this galaxy long ago.
the ship is turning around.
fire the thrusters!
he says a gravitational field
that strong will kill anyone.
<i>- were completely unjustified.</i>
<i>they and all others must know...</i>
<i>...that the united states of america
will not yield...</i>
<i>...to international terrorism or to blackmail.</i>
sir! we'll be crushed!
there's not enough time!
...are controlled by capitalists
and large oil companies.
the united states government considers
revolutionaries as terrorists...
...but itself and its cia are the most
terrorizing organization of all time.
<i>"the story was told,
but there are infinitely more.</i>
<i>three setting suns.

<i>if we find his ship
we will find our chance.</i>
<i>aboard the argo lies
my hope, my hero, my husband.</i>
we will begin the trials
and carry out the sentences.
<i>you wonder where and how this
seemingly endless parade of hatred will end.</i>
embassy basement - january 23. 1980
<i>what do they want? they say the question
should be not "what?" but "who?"</i>
<i>the answer to that is clear.
they want their former shah.</i>
<i>... carter and his administration
shameful to talk about human rights.</i>
carter and his government have given
asylum to the worst criminal of all.
<i>for life?</i>
<i>they will remain until the shah is returned.</i>
<i>but if the exiled shah,
now in a new york city hospital...</i>
<i>...leaves the united states
for any place other than iran...</i>
<i>...harsher decisions will be taken
against the hostages.</i>
<i>"we out outside to the shidoori dome...</i>

- hello.
- hey.
<i>- hi.
- hi.</i>
how you doing?
<i>- good. you sound good.
- i am.</i>
it's like, we might be
doing something good.
you know, we're having his birthday party
at a bowling alley.
so you should come.
- when is it?
- on his birthday.
<i>- i see. nice choice.
- mm-hm. mm-hm.</i>
i just didn't know if it was a weekend, or...
but that's fine.
okay, i might come. i'll try.
don't try, tony. just come.
hey, did you brush your teeth?
i gotta go enforce this.
okay. go enforce. i'll talk to you soon.
huh.
<i>- well, why'd he do it?
- he did it because he did it.</i>
he saw a covert intelligence officer
saying "cheese" with r2-d2.
they're going with the teachers.
it's a fucking death sentence, jack.
well, then it's on engell.
it's done, tony. wash your hands.
listen, i've done 30 movies.
half of them, the pricks upstairs
tried to shut down.
not this one.
my ass is staying right here
and i'm gonna run a movie company.
hey. first shot of the picture.
argo fuck yourself.
argo fuck yourself.
how'd you get around the pricks upstairs?
how'd you get the meeting?
i went over d. op's head.
and i used your name.
you can forget about that time-share

office of the secretary of state
january 25, 1980
<i>brace yourself. it's like talking to
those two old fucks on the muppets.</i>
aliens and robots?
yes, sir.
you're telling me that there is a movie
company in hollywood right now...
...that is funded by the cia?
yes, sir.
- what's wrong with the bikes again?
- we tried to get the message upstairs, sir.
you think this is more plausible
than teachers?
yes, we do.
one, there are no more foreign teachers in iran.
and we think everybody
knows hollywood people.
everybody knows they'd shoot in stalingrad
with pol pot directing if it would sell tickets.
there are only bad options.
it's about finding the best one.
you don't have a better bad idea than this?
this is the best bad idea we have, sir.
by far.
the united states government has just
sanctioned your science-fiction movie.
thank you, sir.
i'm required to remind you that if you are
detained, the agency will not claim you.
barely claim me as it is.
your "in case of's" good?
it's just christine.
i should've brought some books
to read in prison.
no.
they'll kill you long before prison.
- thanks for the ride.
- yeah.
studio six.
we got a green light. keep the office
running until you hear otherwise.
argo fuck yourself.
argo fuck yourself.
it's getting kind of late. is he gonna show?
some people have it worse.
some people have it better.
<i>your attention, please.</i>
<i>this is the final boarding call
for british airways flight 87.</i>
<i>"we are a nation of 35 million.</i>
and many of these people are looking
forward to martyrdom."
- hey.
- hey.
come to bed.
in five minutes.
you know, she pleaded with me.
when it started in the streets
nine months ago...
...she begged for us to leave.
she packed our bags, and i said:
"you know what?
you know, just a little bit longer."
and all i was thinking was:
"stay.
this is good for me.
stay.
show newsom you got the balls."
i can't believe i put kathy in this position.
i think we're gonna die here.
<i>- hello.
- christine, hi. jack o'donnell.</i>
tony wanted me to let you know
that he's gonna...
gonna be away and won't be able
to call you for a while.
where's he going?
jack, is he safe?
yes. of course, he's safe.
you should've stopped after "yes."
istanbul, turkey - january 27, 1980
"iran is 100 percent
not in a prerevolutionary state."
cia brief, november 1st, 1979.
can't be right all the time.
kevin.
when'd you get back?
the shah escaped in a 747...
...so laden with gold bars,
it nearly didn't make it off the runway.
but you kept busy.
ferrying out the torture apparatus
of our friend's fallen dictatorship.
it's getting worse.
everyone who lands at mehrabad
now fills in one of these.
that slip makes a copy to the one underneath.
passenger keeps yellow, airport keeps white.
when you leave, they match them up...
...to verify you came into the country
when you say you did.
so if they look, they'll see i didn't come
into the country with six people.
if they look.
when you land, you should go straight to
the ministry of culture and islamic guidance...
...to kiss the ring.
get on record as having applied
for a film permit.
if they catch you later, at least they'll be
confused while they're torturing you.
iranian consulate - turkey
what will be the purpose
of your visit to iran?
uh, film production. business.
why didn't you get your visa in canada?
i would've loved to, except my boss
didn't send a telex till i got here.
guy had an intelligent thought in his head,
it would die of loneliness.
<i>the times and ap found out six escaped.</i>
they know who they are and they know
they're hiding out with the canadians.
somebody with one of the families talked.
mother of god.
yeah, i just put vance on a plane
to take the editors to le cirque.
he thinks he can
get them to sit on it, for now.
your guy better get them...
...and get the hell out.
the captain has informed
us that we have entered iranian airspace.
<i>we'll be coming through to collect
any remaining alcoholic beverages.</i>
this film crew is just yourself?
no, we have six more from canada
meeting us today.
you like to film at the bazaar?
the bazaar, maybe the palace.
landmark sites.
i see.
the exotic orient.
snake charmers, flying carpets.
you came to us at a complicated time.
before the revolution, 40 percent of the movie
theaters in tehran were showing pornography.
i understand.
the function of this office is purification...
...as well as promotion for the arts.
i'll review this for the minister.
okay. thank you.
lester, you're working late.
till the dawn's early light.
you got stamina, lester. i wanna be you.
well, i'm 150 years old,
so you wouldn't be me for long.
- mr. ambassador.
- ken taylor.
thank you for what you're doing.
i was expecting more of a g-man look.
i think you're thinking of the fbi, sir.
ah. this way.
- these are blank, you know. stamps...
- yeah, i'll take care of this.
how long?
a day, prep their covers.
two if they need it.
and you'll fly outwith them?
yeah.
there's something you should know.
we think our housekeeper
has figured out who they are.
we don't know if we can trust her,
so sooner is better.
hi.
my name's kevin harkins...
...and i'm gonna get you home.
these are the screenplays
for your cover identities.
it's theater of the absurd.
- what are our chances?
- your chances are good.
"good"? well, what's the number value
of "good"?
thirty percent chance
of being publicly executed?
can you tell me what the objection was
to normal cover identities?
there are no canadians in the country
for normal reasons.
- they'll sniff us out regardless.
- the swedish consul?
they accused him of being an american
at the airport. they held him for an hour.
we can't hold up under that.
we don't know what the hell movie people do.
that's why i'm here.
i'm gonna help you. i'll be with you
the whole way. this is what i do.
have you gotten people out
this way before?
this would be a first.
do you know that every day they catch
another friend of the shah at the airport?
kangaroo trials and then firing squads...
...just for having american names
in their phone books.
you've been here an hour.
and you're asking us to trust you
with our lives, mr...?
harkins.
that's your real name?
no.
i know there are risks involved.
serious risks.
but it is time to go.
we've got orders to close the embassy
and go back. there's nowhere for them to stay.
we will never make it through
immigration at the airport. i'm serious.
no, no, no, this is what, the part when
we say this is so crazy it might actually work?
joe, i saw it in burma. they get people out.
snitches in banana republics?
they get them over the border after the coup.
that's your opinion, joe.
you know, his opinion got us out
in the first place.
if we go out there with fake passports,
we are spies, period. that's execution.
- you got a problem lying, joe?
- point is, we can't stay here.
if we get caught, you and pat go on trial
for harboring the enemy, you know that?
pat and i have discussed it.
it's the risk we took.
that man out there
has got bad cards and he is going to lose.
and if he loses, it's our lives.
and his life too.
look, we don't have any alternatives.
we gotta go.
these cover identities were created
specifically for each one of you.
what you need to do is memorize
everything that's inside.
who you are, what you are,
where you've been. complete bio.
and then add to that.
where do you vacation? what are your
allergies? who'd you have an affair with?
the only way this works...
...is if you believe that you're these people
so much that you dream like them.
get started tonight.
i'll be back tomorrow.
we'll get going. good luck.
well, my guy kind of sucks.
what's your name?
mike mcewan, eh? heh.
that was convincing.
kathy, what's your name?
<i>the love boat
will be seen 15 minutes from now.</i>
<i>the state department insisted today
that the crisis in afghanistan...</i>
<i>...will not divert the attention of the
united states from the plight of the hostages.</i>
<i>- -is perceived to be if not impotent,
then at least reluctant...</i>
<i>now the united states finds itself in such
bitter confrontation with the soviet union...</i>
<i>...over that country's invasion
of afghanistan....</i>
<i>the united states
is now moving toward a decision...</i>
<i>...to boycott the summer olympics
in moscow...</i>
bad news, bad news.
even when it's good news, it's bad news.
john wayne's in the ground six months,
this is what's left of america.
<i>"the minister of culture and guidance
has approved your location scout.</i>
he will send his representative to meet
you and your crew...
...at the khayyam entrance
to the grand bazaar tomorrow at 3 p.m."
they called your bluff.
- maybe they're cooperating.
- absolutely not.
seven americans walking the bazaar
is asking for a riot. it's the hive.
seven canadians, jack.
<i>never give them multiple shots at a cover.</i>
are they even ready?
they're getting there.
there's no prize for "most improved."
i don't have a choice.
we say no, they show up at the residence...
...and drag everyone out.
you think their covers are gonna hold up...
...when they're getting their fingernails
pulled out?
you want us to go to the grand bazaar
at 3:00 in the afternoon?
you said a day to learn our covers,
then straight to the airport.
they suspect something?
what i know is,
we need to pretend to be a movie crew.
we go to the bazaar today,
we fly out from the airport tomorrow.
we won't do it.
he told them that there were six of us.
so they're expecting six.
it would be suspicious
not to show up at this point.
what else do we have to do, all right?
he's about to show them
the only cards that we're holding...
- ...which is that they don't know we're here!
- that's the ball game, okay?
look, we don't have any other choice!
who says that we'll know our covers
well enough?
we're not in the cia.
it's suicide.
i'm asking you to trust me.
i don't trust you.
this is the game, joe.
what world are you living in?
the one where they're hanging people
from construction cranes, bob.
it's too dangerous.
i won't bring my wife into the bazaar.
anders joe?
so we'll see you at 2.
so don't be recognizable
but look exactly like your passport photo.
i haven't been this nervous
since our wedding.
only this isn't a huge mistake, hopefully.
sorry. okay.
hello?
hello?
hello?
who was that?
- mark?
- yeah?
i'm scared.
it's okay.
where are they?
in the kitchen.
this is what i do. i get people out.

i wish i could believe you, mr. harkins.
my name is tony mendez.

...but she doesn't understand the language
or the customs...
...and there is misunderstandings
and laughs.
oh, no.
the bazaar in tehran
is one of the largest in the world.
this bazaar has been on this spot
for over 8000 years.
you can find many items
such as paper, spices...
...precious metals, all right here.
right this way, please.
this way.
- uh, mike?
- yeah.
if i was to say you're looking through the
wrong end of that viewfinder, would i be right?
yup.

...those who are with him, rasool of allah,
we are tender among ourselves.
but stern against the kufar.
as god wills it.
but those who sit silently have sinned.
how else may i help, sir?
no, no, just one thing.
how long have they been here?
pardon?
the guests of the ambassador.
the guests of the ambassador.
how long have they been here?
they arrived two days ago.
forgive my intrusion, one must be vigilant.
everyone in this house is a friend of iran.
how'd it go?
what about tomorrow?
tomorrow they'll be ready.
<i>for kennedy, a stunning turnaround...</i>
<i>...one week after humiliation in illinois.</i>
<i>i love new york.</i>
<i>and i love connecticut too.</i>
<i>how did he win here? well, he had help.</i>
<i>i'm responsible for anything

back to front.
you really believe your
little story's gonna make
a difference when there's
a gun to our heads?
i think my story's the only thing
between you and a gun to your head.
okay.
hey, they made it through
the location scout.
you have a call.
what is it?
go to black on green.
go.
<i>- it all just changed.
- what?</i>
<i>- they're calling the game. you gotta come back.
- what?</i>
joint chiefs are planning
a military rescue of the hostages.
<i>delta force has started training
to storm the grounds.</i>
<i>so if the six of them...</i>
...are brought down there,
they won't be held for long.
fuck. goddamn it. i never would have exposed
them if i wasn't authorized to get them out.
- it's over, tony.
- if they stay here, they will be taken.
- probably not alive.
- listen to me. the thinking has changed.
six americans get pulled out
of a canadian diplomat's house and executed...
...it's a world outrage.
six americans get caught playing
movie make-believe...
...with the cia at the airport and executed?
it's a national embarrassment.
they are calling the operation.
we're responsible for these people.
what we are is required to follow orders.
<i>i'm sorry.</i>
fuck!
come in.
ready to try again.
you're ready. you worked hard.

right now would be...
...just to relax.
okay.
you did good.
thanks.
scorched-earth policy tonight.
nothing gets left.
so you know.
extaff wants you to burn the passports
before you leave.
if we tell them now, they'll panic.
i think it's best if you just don't show.
it was always a fucked mission.
you came closer than anybody else.
<i>if it keeps on rainin'
levee's goin' to break</i>
<i>when the levee breaks
i'll have no place to stay</i>
a little closer. keep going.
now. stop.
nope.
- yeah.

somebody's responsible...
...when things happen, jack.
i'm responsible.
- i'm taking them through.
- tony?
alan. alan. we need to confirm those
seven tickets out of tehran on swissair.

- i say it's back on.
- i can't do it. it's backstopped.

jack, you are this close.
am i? am i really that close?
you are this goddamn close to the line
with me.
i am not gonna leave him at the airport
with six people and his dick in his hand.
you tell the director to call the white house.
do your fucking job!
get to your plane, claude.
first time anyone's gonna ask you
a question is at the first checkpoint.
<i>the first checkpoint is just
to get a look at your passports.</i>
<i>passports came straight from ottawa
last week. they're clean.</i>

<i>macdonald:

<i>thank you to pat and ken taylor
and the great nation of canada.</i>
so i'm sitting in jerry's this morning,
i'm having breakfast.
waitress comes over to me,
she's waving a newspaper, and she says:
"you see what those canadians pulled off?
why can't we do something like that?"
and i said to her... do you know what i said?
no, what?
"argo fuck yourself."
all set.
thanks a lot.
ha!
heh. and i left my autograph book at home.
his eminence called me.
he wants to see you.
probably wants to fire me himself.
he wants to give you the intelligence star.
you're getting the highest award of merit...
...of the clandestine services
of these united states.
ceremony's on the 14th.
if they push it a week, i can bring ian.
that's his winter break.
the op was classified,
so the ceremony's classified.
he can't know about it.
nobody can know about it.
so they're just gonna give me an award
and then they're gonna take it back.
that's right.
if we wanted applause,
we would've joined the circus.
- i thought we did.
- ha.
carter said you were a great american.
great american what?
he didn't say.
what happened to your picture?
it's in turnaround.
can i come in?
the iran hostage crisis ended on january 20.
remaining hostages were released.
they spent 444 days in captivity.
the involvement of the c.i.a.
complemented efforts of
the canadian embassy in freeing
the six held in tehran.
to this day, this story
stands as an enduring model
for international cooperation
between governments.
all of the houseguests returned to the u.s.
foreign service after their ordeal in iran.
oscar-winning makeup artist john chambers was
awarded the c.i.a.'s intelligence medal, its
highest civilian honor. he and mendez remained
friends until chambers' death in 2001.
tony mendez's intelligence star
was returned to him in 1997,
when the argo operation was
declassified by president clinton.
he lives in rural maryland with his family.
<i>they went in, as you know, under
the guise of creating a motion-picture film.</i>
<i>but that it had a very high possibility
of failure.</i>
<i>and after it was successful, of course...</i>
<i>...it was a great temptation
to reveal all the stories...</i>
<i>...so maybe i could take a little bit
of credit for it, since i was president...</i>
<i>...but we had to keep it secret.
tony mendez has gone down in cia history...</i>
<i>...after his retirement...</i>
<i>...as one of the 50 most important
cia operatives of all time.</i>
<i>eventually we got every hostage
back home, safe and sound...</i>
<i>...and we upheld the integrity of our country,
and we did it peacefully.</i>
