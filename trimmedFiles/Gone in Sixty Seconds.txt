"?he stranger," huh?

...hands behind your back.
?ou have the right to remain silent.
hey, watch it!
we have a silver porsche,
estimated speed 80 miles per hour,
- heading west on wilshire boulevard.
- ?eah.
this is air one.
we have a visual of the suspect,
southbound on vincent thomas bridge.

?eah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
?hat's right, that's right, that's right!

vin number on that? got it.
what do we got?
all gone. we didn't get a single one of 'em,
and we are talkin' about professionals.
no ?isible damage to locking mechanisms,
steering columns or ignitions,
and, as you can see,
these are not ?onda ci?ics.
?his is one of three brand-new ?ercedes -
a car they say is unstealable.
?eah, unless you get
the laser-cut transponder key
sent directly to the us dealer
from ?amburg.
?hey got somebody working on the inside.
let's find out which dealership sold 'em,
serviced 'em, et cetera, et cetera.
?eah, i'll get on it.
- ?r. drycoff?
- ?eah?
let's impound these cars for one month.
i don't give a damn
if they belong to ?om cruise.
control.
vision.
determination.
?hese are the three
fundamental components
of the new-generation race-car dri?er.
speed is a by-product. goin' fast.
but remember - the car is you.
?ou are the car.
ok? let's ride!
billy, you just shaved one second
off your lap time!
?ommy, i don't know what that was,
but it wasn't dri?ing.
go get 'em!
well, well, well.
what do you pay your pit crews with?
oreos and gummi ?ears?
i folded, atley. ?ou know that.
what are you doing here?
- is there some place we can talk?
- about what?
about your brother
and the deep shit he's in.
frank. would you watch the kids
for a minute?
- ?ell me about kip.
- he took a job and he fumbled it.
now he's jammed up.
he's jammed up bad.
- what kind of job?
- a boost. a big boost.
a boost.
what's kip doin' on a boost?
oh, you're shittin' me, man. ?ip's become
quite the little crew runner since you left.
- ?ou don't talk to your ma?
- she neglected to mention it.
listen, i need somethin'.
i need something cold to drink.
i thought we were goin' someplace to talk.
- who was the job for?
- a new guy named raymond calitri.
?hey call him the carpenter. ?e's runnin'
all the dark ponies down there now.
he's a full-on devil-came-down-
to-long-?each trip.
he's bad.
he's real bad.
and this calitri
is the one who's after my brother?
like stains on a mattress.
and you should know i work for him.
?here weren't a lot of opportunities
for retired car thieves on the gimp.
he put me to work.
but i gotta tell you, ?emphis, this guy,
he scares the shit out of e?en me.
what are you doing, man?
stop!
atley jackson.
right.
- ?hey have kip.
- ?ake me there.
raymond calitri, ?emphis raines.
i try to learn your ways,
understand your obsessions.
but this baseball,
it's so bleedin' boring. innit?
where's my brother?
?emphis raines.
?our legend precedes you.
atley tells me you're the best.
after you left, auto theft
in the south bay area went down 47%.
where's my brother?
i'm proud of these. straddle chair
from the arts and crafts period.
?ahogany table with cloud-lift pattern,
black walnut wine table.
?etal's cold, ugly.
wood's warm, clean.
pro?ided by nature.
?o see a piece of furniture take shape,
it's like watching a child grow.
i asked you a question.
?hey threw us out ?ngland,
threw us out of france, but here we are.
flourishing, really,
except for the minor inconvenience of
despising everything about your country.
on this list, you'll find 50 cars.
fi?e-zero.
i need all 50 delivered
to long ?each harbour, pier 14,
by 8am four days from now.
i'm paying $200,000.
i'm not interested.
i'm just here for my brother.
?our ?ip came to me.
he had street cred.
?he brother of the notorious
?emphis raines.
so two weeks ago i hired him
and ad?anced him $10,000.
atley told me. if it's about the ad?ance,
i can understand your anger.
a debt has to be settled.
?en grand, from me to you.
- i wish it was that easy.
- i don't see the complication.
i have four days to deli?er 50 cars,
and i have no cars.
- well, that's another problem.
- it is another problem, isn't it?
it's about me deli?ering 50 top-end cars
because i said i would,
because if i don't, my south american
friend goes somewhere else from now on.
and that's not good.
it's a humiliation.
because i'm the arsehole
who said i could deliver.
am i an arsehole?
do i look like an arsehole?
?eah.
- i need that paper satisfying.
- i'm retired.
now, where the hell is my brother?
i made this as well.
?y first one.
it takes 80,000 pounds of pressure
to crush a car.
kip?
- who's that?
- ?emphis.
- oh, shit.
- ?ou ok?
- shut it off!
- ?urn it off!
?ou've got 30 seconds
to consider your options.
shut it off!
one. ?ou kill me, they kill you,
your brother dies anyway.
?wo. ?ou lie, you accept the job,
you take your brother, you run.
i hunt you down, i kill you,
i kill your brother
and i kill your mother
for the aggra?ation you'?e caused me.
?hree. ?ou accept the deal, you steal
some cars, you make some money
and you be a big brother.
- ?emphis!
- 8am, friday morning.
?he cars are on the boat,
or your brother's in the coffin.
get me out of here!
somebody get me out of here!
listen, you really
don't ha?e to make me anything.
oh, hey, you come down here,
you save my ass. it's the least i can do.
hey, i heard you were, uh, pumping gas
some place up north, or something, right?
- ?eah, working with kids.
- oh, yeah.
first place.
i remember this.
oh, yeah. ?hat was a...
that was a long time ago.
- what did you put in it?
- i don't know.
it's good.
- does ?om know about any of this?
- no, she doesn't, and...
i don't think she should.
?ou know, she works really hard, and...
she doesn't need to know
about any of this stuff.
look, you know,
i got everything under control.
kitchen's on fire.
uh... ?an!
hey, ?emphis.
it's good to see you.
?aul the cartons over there!
- hey, fuzzy.
- aw, shit. what are you doing here?
- i told you i don't know anything.
- ?eah, but you're a liar.
- ?ou're gonna get me fired, man.
- fired? ?hat's not good.
- ?ou're on parole, right?
- fuzzy. ?ey.
nobody wants to get you fired.
we just need this information, is all.
?wo weeks ago, a call came in
for a lot of top-end cars.
- and who made that call?
- i don't have a clue.
- ok, we should go talk to your boss.
- shh!
?he deli?ery date.
i know the delivery date.
- and when is that?
- ?hursday, friday, end of the week.
well, you get me a name
within 48 hours, or we'll be back.
- good to see you, buddy.
- ?hank you.
- i'm looking for ?elen raines.
- helen, some guy is here for you.
what guy?
what's he look like?
like a firecracker.
like your son.
- ?ou look so good.
- ?hank you, ?om.
- i got a spring bouquet.
- what are you doing here?
well, atley jackson came to see me.
he told me something about kip.
can i help you with one of these?
?ell castlebeck he's not gonna believe
who just walked into the quality cafe.
i can't say i'm surprised.
all his life he looked up to you,
tried to be you.
guess now he is.
so why is this happening?
i send you guys money.
he met some people, and he changed.
he lost that... that sweetness.
?ou know?
ok.
?ell me.
how deep in is he?
deep.
can you get him out?
it means doing things.
?hings i told you i'd never do again.
do what it takes, randall.
- when did you get into town, raines?
- last night.
- last night? what for?
- i thought i'd catch a lakers game.
heard we got shaquille.
?ou guys wanna go?
- guess not.
- randall, randall, randall. come here.
i get this call from this uniform,
you know. axton.
very nice man.
remembers everything.
?his man calls me up, says,
"guess who's back in town."
i say, "who?"
he says, "randall raines."
i say, "randall raines the car thief?"
he says, "?eah."
i say, "impossible."
he says, "no, he's back."
i say, "no, he's not." ?e says, "yes, i will
bet you $200 i just saw randall raines."
- ?ou guys said a lot. look, detecti?e...
- no, whoa, whoa.
what's really, really ironic about this -
two nights ago, we snare these 13
fresh stolens waiting for export, right?
and at the time i'm thinking,
"?his feels like randall raines."
now, it didn't have
your panache, your flash,
but it just felt like randall raines.
and now here you are.
look, i don't know what you boys are
looking for, but i just got back. ok?
it was a family emergency.
now, that's the truth.
"family emergency." ?eah, i got
a family emergency, too, randall.
i gotta go tell my woman
that i just lost $200 on a stupid deal.
- ?m, she's mean.
- what?
she can be mean.
it's not so...
come here.
come here, randall.
and take those glasses off, randall,
please. do me a fa?our.
six years ago you make
a real smart mo?e, you know.
?ou retire from a life that's gonna get
you busted or killed, or maybe even both.
and i'm thinkin' that not putting you away
when i had a chance
is like this big bug up the ass of
this real impressi?e career that i've had.
oh, yeah, well, without disappointment,
you can't appreciate ?ictory.
- ?leanor tell you that?
- well, now, that's hittin' below the belt.
?eah, all right, let me tell you
about "below the belt," randall.
i tell you what - from here on out,
if you walk across the street
outside of a crosswalk,
if you roll through a stop sign,
if you use an aerosol can
in a manner other than directed...
i mean, i don't care. you make one slip,
and i will put you away for good.
- ok.
- by the time you get out, asshole,
there won't even be cars.
we'll all be cruisin' around in,
you know, little spaceships.
?hat's gonna suck.
who's ?leanor?
it's a damn car.
and don't e?er talk about my wife.
?xcuse me.
do you know where otto is?
he's in the back, in the paint shop.
is that you?
it's about time you came to see me.
- i missed you.
- good to see you!
- ?ou look great.
- it's good to see you.
- ?ou remember my junie?
- hey, junie. ?ow are you?
- we're doing good, thank you.
- good. good.
- ?ou look happy.
- well, i am happy. i really am.
- so what happened here?
- what do you mean?
well, it's nice. but the chop shop,
the stripped cars, my education...
what happened? ?ey.
old age happened. that's what happened.
got tired of killin' 'em.
?ou know, i woke up
one morning and thought:
"i'm no longer a destroyer.
i am a means of resurrection."
now we restore, we revive. come here.
remember when we used to do this?
- what?
- ?ou know. come here. ok.
?he ferrari 365 g?b/4 daytona.

- raymond calitri.
uh, excuse us, sweetness.
i'll be right back.
- we can talk right here.
- no, no, no, no. it's all right.
raymond calitri.
he's a jackal tearing at the soft belly
of our... of our fair town.
and he's an asshole to boot,
so be careful.
i heard about kip.
- are you considering a comeback tour?
- do you think it can be done?
don't do this to me, ok? please.
please. not now.
oh, man.
- how many cars?
- 50.
- how many days?
- ?hree.
how many in your crew?
one, but i came here hoping
to negotiate for a second.
no way. it can't be done. i mean, you need
time to prep, time to shop. you know that.
it has to be.
?hey're gonna kill him.
?an.
it was a mistake to come here.
?ou have a great life now.
i don't wanna upset that.
uh, wait a minute.
whoa. hold on.
look around you.
?hese days i'm all about second chances.
so let's make a few phone calls

just like normal people.
shit.
what's the matter with you?
?an, six years does
a lot of different things to people.
?ou know, i don't know where you went,
but, you know, you're in there,
you're talkin' about bein' normal.
i mean, you were always the one
who was goin' after the easy money.
i didn't do it for the money.
i did it for the cars.
gleaming in marina blue...
sunflower yellow... ?arlboro red.
begging to be plucked.
and i'd do it.
i'd boost her...
and just blast to palm springs,
instantly feeling better about being me.
and then, the next day, it seems like,
i'm getting shot at,
my friends are dying,
people are going to jail.
i didn't like what i'd become.
?eah, and then you left,
and then i didn't ha?e
a brother anymore.
and now you wanna give me ad?ice,
and i don't e?en know you.
and, you know, i got my own family now.
i got my own friends.
and, you know, you can say what you want
about them, but they're loyal.
well, when you hit the wall,
the same thing is gonna happen.
?ou and your family
are either gonna get shot
or get a fi?e-year jolt at corcoran.
?hose ?ercedes we impounded,
need those newfangled laser-cut keys?
?ach one's from dressner foreign ?otors,
downtown newport,
where all the employees are clean
except for him.
james lakewood, served a nickel
at folsom for auto insurance fraud.
well, gosh, i bet he just neglected
to mention that
to the people
at dressner foreign ?otors, huh?
it gets better. ?oung james there
places orders for lost keys
to ?ercedes home office in germany.
?he list.
ah, the list.
i guess we gotta start beatin' the bushes
and try to find out where they... whoa.
- 1967 shelby gt 500.

what are you doin' here, kip?
well, actually...
we came to talk about some things.
- about what?
- well, you know.
it seems like you guys need a little help,
and we thought that we should participate.
but i just promised ?om
i was getting you out of this.
listen... no, no, we're talking
about a lot of money here.
- and if you guys think you're gonna be...
- what? ?oney?
...gettin' into our kool-aid...
is that why you think i'm doing this?
?ou inconsiderate little punk!
- if you wanna participate, tell ?om...
- ?ou think three washed-up car thieves...
...why her little pumpkin's gonna get hurt!
...are gonna steal 50 cars in two days?
hey. hey.
?his is why i do not
do business with family.
i think you should consider this.
oh, come on, now, otto, please. no,
his criminal career has come to an end.
well, his life will come to an end
unless we pull this off.
and how can we do it without him?
it can't be done, and you know it.

that you old farts probably ne?er heard of.
?ou know, uh, ?umbler o?er here, he can
pretty much drive anything with wheels,
and, you know,

he does fascinating things with computers.
what exactly can you do
with a computer, ?oby?
i can hack into the d?v mainframe,
i can change vin numbers,
i can change addresses, registrations.
i can do a lot of really tricky stuff, ok?
all right, all right,

i run this show.
?ou take your orders from me.
if you have any problems with that,
you can leave now.
no, that's fine.
who is gilligan here,
and what does he do?
gilligan is actually freb. freb can order
pizzas like nobody's business.
- what?
- it's true.
hey, people gotta eat, right?
?his is outrageous.
i want my lawyer.
- i'm not saying a word till i get a lawyer.
- all right, james, that's an option.
- and, frankly, a reasonable one.
- so you call your lawyer, james.
?ou tell him you've been arrested
on suspicion of grand theft auto.
- we indict you.
- he'll bail you out.
- and we mo?e on to trial.
- ok, ok.
kid came to me, said he'd pay $500 a key.
so i put the order forms through, and
he picked 'em up a couple days later.
- what's the kid's name?
- we kept it anonymous.
he was a well-built kid.
uh, looks like a boxer.

?ou play shadow games and shit.
we're on a truncated timetable.
otto, i'm sorry. can you just listen
to me for one second?
we heard you, kip.
shadow games.
but what you ha?e to understand
is that if you play shadow games,
by the second night,
the heat is onto you.
with a one-night boost, by the time
the first car is reported stolen,
your ship's set sail.
it's a surprise attack.
?his is a complicated list, fellas.
it really is. ok?
?here are 25 that aren't a problem,
but these exotics are tough to find.
and the new ?ercedes,
they require laser-cut keys. ok?
- ?eah, i got that co?ered.
- ?ou have that co?ered?
what'd i just say?
?eah, i got it co?ered.
all right, all right.
well, then, let's get to work.
toby, hack into the insurance database
and find as many cars as you can.
?es! i got addresses on hilary,
natalie and tracy.
donny, check the dmv
for the remaining cars on the list.
i'm sorry, miss, but you'?e missed
fi?e questions. that's failing.

faster when somebody tailgates you!
ah. hello again.
here's your list of the 20 car owners'
names and addresses that you requested.

and saturday night
is the loneliest night of the week for me.
well, a ferrari would certainly change that.
perhaps. but, you know...
?his is the one. ?es, yes, yes.
i saw three of these parked outside
the local starbucks this morning,
which tells me only one thing - there's
too many self-indulgent wieners in this city
with too much bloody money!
now, if i was driving
a 1967275 gtb four-cam...
?ou would not be
a self-indulgent wiener, sir.
- ?ou'd be a connoisseur.
- precisely.
champagne would fall from the heavens.
doors would open.
velvet ropes would part.
i don't have one here.
howe?er, i do ha?e one in the warehouse.
superb. what else do you have
in the warehouse?
?m. all right. uh-huh.
?hat was ?r. lakewood
from the dealership.
he says that boxer-looking punk
is gonna pick up the keys
to three new ?ercedes today.
same make and model as the ones
we already got impounded.
now we talkin'.
the el spirito de graciela
sails friday, 8am sharp.
we'll target all the cars
within 45 minutes of here.
by the time their alarm-tracking systems
are activated,
the cars will already be

teams at those addresses.

and you make your move, man...
and i will be waiting for you.
why do you call 'em girls' names?
?hat's a good question.

?rying to get reacquainted.
?ou know, they had a rough history. she

would be stupid enough
to try to rip this car off.

you were gonna walk his line.
?ou were gonna join his crew.
and she told him to pick up and go.
and he did, thinking it was best for you.
he left all of us... for you.
guess it wasn't that big a deal
for him, though, really.
wasn't that big a sacrifice, lea?ing
e?erything he'd e?er known behind.
and six years later, ain't life grand?
?ou became a car boost anyway.
how about that?
i sedated him. ?e's sleeping.

?hen big brother takes the fall for
the slip-up. doesn't matter much to me.
one raines is as good as another.

??erybody out there pressed

?wenty-one-gun salute and the stars
and stripes draped all o?er your coffin.
it'll be the greatest day of your life.
here i am smack-dab in the middle
of a moral dilemma, randall.
?ou've torn this town to shreds
with that little escapade of yours,
you and your eleanor.
but i understand
what brought you back here.
a brother's lo?e is a brother's love.
?ou sa?ed my life, didn't you?

- damn.
ow. ow.
poor ?oby, man.
sure looks like he's in a lot of pain.
hey, if that's pain,
you can shoot me anytime.
sexy, sassy.
if his unpleasant wounding has in
some way enlightened the rest of you
as to the grim finish below
the glossy veneer of criminal life,
and inspired you to change your ways,
then his injuries carry with it
an inherent nobility
and a supreme glory.
we should all be so fortunate.
?ou say, "poor ?oby."
i say, "poor us."
- he spoke.
- ?eah.
hey, man, i thought
you were from long beach.
?emphis. ?ey.

it's a heap, but gi?e me a couple of weeks
and it'll look like a streamlined butterfly.
- ?ou didn't?
- oh, no, no, no, no.
i parted the chopper out for that.
i'm blown away.
?ou bought me a car.
well, yeah, you know,
it's just a token of my appreciation
for e?erything, you know.

?hat's the way it should be.
