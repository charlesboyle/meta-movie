<i>narrator: once upon a time,</i>
<i>there was a brave little mouse</i>
<i>who loved honor and justice
and always told the truth.</i>
(captain barking orders)
<i>no, that's not him.</i>
(yawning)
<i>that's a rat.</i>
<i>and anyone who knows anything,</i>
<i>knows there's a big difference
between a mouse and a rat.</i>
ohhh.
<i>first of all, rats
hate the light.</i>
(groans)
<i>they spend their
lives in the darkness.</i>
<i>they're also
terrified of people,</i>
<i>which is why they slink
and cower all the time.</i>
ooh!
<i>and as far as telling
the truth is concerned,</i>
<i>well, that's impossible
because, as everyone knows,</i>
(clears throat)
<i>a rat can't talk.</i>
tell me that thing
again, please.
come on.
just once, i promise.
tell me one more time,
and i won't ask you
ever again. i swear.
(sighs)
fine. we are headed to dor,
one of the most magical
places in the whole world.
no, that's not what
you said before.
you know, every place
has something special.
and, in dor, it's the soup!
sailor: land ho!
(sailors cheer)
ohhh.
sailor 1: it's down
below, i tell you.
sailor 2: give it a heave.
i can see it!
ooh, i can smell
it! i can smell it.
roscuro: oh, i can't
wait to taste the soup!
just stay close.
we leave again at 6:00.
you know, we ought to think about
staying here just a little longer.
don't even think about it.
remember shanghai?
yeah, but this
place is different.
i mean, this is special.
<i>narrator: on any given day, just
one whiff from one of the soup shops</i>
<i>was almost like
having a full meal.</i>
<i>but on one very
special day every year,</i>
<i>the kingdom of dor was
magically transformed.</i>
(crowd cheering)
<i>in dor, christmas was nothing.</i>
<i>well, they still
celebrated it,</i>
<i>but it was nothing
compared to soup day.</i>
watch it, watch it.
incoming potatoes!
hurry! hurry! excuse us.
<i>every dorian, young and old,
would flock toward the castle</i>
<i>because they knew that,
at that very moment,</i>
<i>deep within the
royal kitchens,</i>
<i>a masterpiece
was being created.</i>
delivery man:
potatoes coming up!
cook 1: let's go!
cook 2: don't
forget the parsley!
cook 1: make sure it's clean!
<i>narrator: everyone knew
chef andre was a genius,</i>
<i>but they got reminded of it on
the first sunday of every spring.</i>
<i>at exactly 12:00 noon,</i>
<i>he would unveil that
year's royal creation.</i>
more onions!
more onions!
more onions!
more onions!
<i>they would jam
the town square,</i>
<i>and, as the aroma
began to build,</i>
<i>so did their anticipation.</i>
- ohhh!
- ow!
sorry.
(trumpet fanfare playing)
(crowd cheering)
wow.
thank you.
(clears throat)
it's my pleasure to announce
this year's royal creations
from the kitchens
of chef andre.
oh, no, no, no, no, no!
something is wrong.
i need more time!
but we're late already!
this is not right!
everyone out!
out!
<i>narrator: now, it's hard to
be a genius all by yourself.</i>
<i>in fact, sometimes,
it takes a little help.</i>
you changed something.
you're crazy. i
did not touch it.
- i can smell it.
- hmm?
- what's this?
- what?
- this!
- ow! garlic.
- garlic.
- yeah, a little garlic.
- it was already there.
- no.
- yes.
- no.
- yes.
- not this much!
ow!
you ruined my soup!
i save your soup!
those people wait all year, and you
want to give them this dishwater.
dishwater?
dishwater.
dishwater?
ow! cut it out!
(clamoring)
(crowd cheering)
and this year's soup is
a spring tureen
<i>with a mélange of
roasted vegetables...</i>
oh.
...fresh herbs...
- mmm!
...and wild mushrooms.
oh.
roscuro?
roscuro?
oh. evening.
chef andre: i don't have to stand here
and listen to a big talking garbage can!
boldo: ha! and i don't have to
stand here and listen to a coward!
- coward?
- yes, a coward!
- you call me coward?
- yes!
(screams)
(gasps)
oh, no!
(exclaims)
(boldo yelps)
oh, no, no, no, no, no.
(muttering) that did it.
- hmm?
- mmm.
both: mmm!
(chuckles)
<i>- bellissima!
- it's fantastique!</i>
roscuro! roscuro,
where are you?
(trumpet fanfare playing)
ohhh.
(drum rolls)
(all gasp)
(sniffs)
whoa!
(sniffs)
<i>voilà!</i>
this is amazing!
chef andre: wait till
your highness tastes it.
hmm?
queen: this is...
whoa!
...absolutely...
(exclaims)
oh, it moved! my soup moved!
no, it isn't...
it did not move.
oh, your highness.
- ahhh!
- darling?
oh! a rat! there's
a rat in my soup!
madam, i know that
this is unfortunate.
and i know that while on
first glance, i might...
- a rat! in my soup!
- no. please. shh, shh, shh.
- and i ate it!
- your highness, hold on...
(gagging)
- uh-oh. - she's
right! it's a rat!
(gasps)
- please...
- ahhh! it's a rat!
get me that rat!
now, i really believe you're
jumping to conclusions.
and i'm sure that the
rats you met last time
might have caused you
to create a stereotype,
but... but i... but...
it's just... i'm just... i'm
not really from around here.
i'm... i'm from... oh...
oh!
that's very aggressive.
guard: get him!
kitchen...
he's going into the kitchen!
oh!
guard: over there!
stop that rat!
whoa!
guard: i got him!
uh-oh.
he's going near the soup!
guard: there he is!
lf... if i could just tell...
guard: on the kettle!
that's him, right there!
look, up there!
(sighs)
sweetie? darling?
she's... she's...
she's...
blimey, she's dead. get him!
guard: don't let him escape!
we'll get you, you rowdy rat!
oh!
no, no, no!
no, not there!
(sobbing)
you don't need to be afraid.
i know it's dark, but
you'll get used to it.
who... who are you?
just a rat, like you.
come with me.
<i>narrator: when something hurts
this much, there must be a reason.</i>
<i>there must be
someone to blame.</i>
(clears throat)
"from this moment on, soup,
"the making of soup, the selling
of soup, or the eating of soup,
"is hereby outlawed
in the kingdom of dor!
"rats are to be
considered illegal as well
"and are hereby deemed unlawful
creatures in the kingdom of dor!

"anyone harboring, sheltering

"shall face the full

<i>what happens when you make something illegal
that is just a natural part of the world?</i>
<i>you may as well
make flies illegal.</i>
<i>or sweat. or monday morning.</i>
<i>but that's what the king did

oh, sorry, milady!
well, at least i
can still feel that.
louise, do you think
there's a bit of light
somewhere in the world?
don't know, ma'am.
i think there is.
you just need to
know where to find it.

when we told you how,</i>
<i>once upon a time, there
was this brave little mouse?</i>
<i>well, if you know
anything about fairytales,</i>

his eyes are open.
don't worry about it.
sometimes they are.
but he isn't cowering.
he's looking right at us.
don't worry. he'll
learn to cower.
they all do in time.
antoinette: but he isn't!
wow! he's so puny!
and look at those ears!
<i>narrator: and, from
the very beginning,</i>
<i>despereaux tilling heard more,</i>
<i>saw more and even smelled more
than any of the other mice.</i>
despereaux, don't do it.
(gasp)
mouse 1: don't
look. don't look!
mouse 2: i won't, i won't.
(groans)
mmm.
<i>narrator: despereaux tilling
had no idea he was small.</i>
<i>he wasn't just
small in human terms.</i>
<i>he was small even for a mouse.</i>
<i>but, to tell you the truth,
he didn't even notice.</i>
<i>in fact, in his own mind,
despereaux was a giant.</i>
we're worried about him.
he doesn't scurry.
he doesn't cower.
at first, we thought he
would grow out of it, but...
well, he scurries sometimes.
but not when he's scared!
he just does it for fun.
and he never cowers.
we've showed him
how, but he...
well, some kids are
slower than others.
he'll cower in time.
we'll work on it.
- yes, but...
- it'll be fine, i promise.
all right, settle down.
ready, class?
(all gasp)
good.
all: mmm! ah!
good. excellent.
(all scream)
- despereaux!
- yes?
you didn't cower.
looks like a sword.
it's a carving knife.
it's beautiful!
it's dangerous.
do you have anymore?
despereaux, what
are you doing?
we're not even
supposed to be here.
that's the dungeon.
they have rats down there.
and they'll eat you.
and pull your arms off!
how far down is it?
i don't know. no
one's ever come back.
how come?
'cause... 'cause...
'cause that's where
you go when you get...
(stammering) when you get...
banished.
what do you get banished for?
oh, you know.
- rules and...
- breaking.
- we can't even...
- talk about it...
- because...
- that's one of the...
all: rules!
mouse 1: despereaux!
i just want to
have a quick look.
we got to get out of here!
mouse 1: oh, gosh.
mouse 2: oh, no.
all: oh, jeez.
uh-oh.
despereaux! you
can't feed them.
hello?
(echoes)
here you go, whoever you are.
(chuckling) nice.
you are crazy!
what i say? i said nothing!
well, you heard
exactly what i said.
- i say you crazy.
- no, no, no, no!
(playing music)
(alarm bell ringing)
rat: hurry!
(rats chanting)
(crowd cheers)
smudge: ha! they
look hungry, sir.
mmm-hmm.
dinnertime.
(clamoring)
(chuckles)
you're not eating.
uh, i was.
no, you weren't.
well, i'm just watching, sir.
well, that's not
very grateful of you
after i've taken
you under my wing.
(stammering) well, i'm
grateful, really. i am.
you miss something, don't you?
uh, no, i don't.
there's nothing
up there, roscuro.
nothing at all.
oh, no, i know
that! absolutely.
uh, nothing!
nothing. nothing at all.
he's a tough one.
you're not gonna turn
him. nah, you're not.
oh, i don't know.
a rat is a rat.
it doesn't really matter
where you come from.
roscuro: i'm sorry.
mouse: he is so weird.
(laughs) no kidding.
that is so beautiful.
i wonder what's out there.
"february 1: doesn't scurry.
"february 3: didn't cower.
"didn't cower. didn't cower.
"wouldn't scurry."
oh, here's one: "drew pictures
of cats on his notebook."
- no! cats?
- oh! i can't imagine!
i'm afraid so.
named it fluffy.
- oh, i had no idea!
- oh! that's terrible.
- despereaux.
- yes, sir?
come in, please.
despereaux, why do you
think you're in school?
to learn?
- to learn, yes.
- yes.
to learn what?
(hesitating) to learn
how to be a mouse, sir.
that is correct.
and you can't be a mouse if
you don't learn to be afraid.
oh, despereaux, this...
there's so many wonderful
things in life to be afraid of
if you'd just learn
how scary they are.
yes. yes, sir.
how about his brother?
his brother? what about him?
yes, is he, you know, timid?
oh! oh, yes!
- yes, very timid.
- yes. so timid!
as timid as the day is long.
good. good.
sometimes they just need
to see the older ones do it.
no one starts out afraid.
- understood.
- of course.
- you coddle that boy, that's the problem.
- no.
- yes, you do.
- no, no.
- yes, you do. you've been doing it for years.
- he was always...
he's little. i've
had to help him.
he's not going to be afraid
unless you allow him to be afraid.
well, furlough will teach him.
do what he does.
and don't do
anything he doesn't.
and if he's afraid
of something...
then you need to be
afraid of it, too.
oh!
wow.
come on, furlough, hurry up!
whoa...
furlough: all right, now, you start
nibbling right along that edge there.
the glue is all right, but it's
the pages that taste the best.
hmm. "once upon a time."
that's great, isn't it?
"upon a time."
and they don't even tell
you what time that is yet.
it's like you have
to find that out.
you're not supposed to read it,
despereaux. you're supposed to eat it.
good. i'll come
back in an hour.
and no reading! it's a rule.
<i>narrator: once upon a time,
there lived a fair princess,</i>
<i>fairer than any
in any other land.</i>
hmm. fair.
<i>and, as the story goes, she was
locked up in a faraway castle,</i>
<i>where she could see the world
but could never touch it.</i>
<i>she longed for a prince.</i>
<i>a brave knight who would
deliver her from all of this.</i>
<i>someone with courage
and honor and decency.</i>
<i>but in a cruel and
frightened world,</i>
<i>men like this
were scarce indeed.</i>
(dragon roaring)
(grunts)
<i>they lived in a special world</i>
<i>built on courage and
chivalry and honor.</i>
<i>they pledged their
lives to each other.</i>
<i>to fight for truth,
to defend the weak,</i>
<i>to seek justice,
and to always...</i>
lester: how was the library?
fine.
spoil your appetite?
no. helped it, actually.
made me hungrier.
good lad.
ha-hah!
did you see they're putting up
a new front on the crumb shop?
antoinette: oh! but i loved the old
front. lester: quite modern. yes.
<i>narrator: did a book
ever speak to you?</i>
<i>almost like it was
written for you?</i>
<i>despereaux loved it all.</i>
<i>every bit of it.</i>
<i>the truth, the
justice, the bravery,</i>
<i>the sword-fighting.</i>
<i>he even loved things
you wouldn't suspect.</i>
<i>the story said
she was a prisoner,</i>
<i>but that wasn't totally true</i>
<i>because she had hope, and
whenever you have hope,</i>
<i>you're never really
anybody's prisoner.</i>
someday, my prince will come.
<i>but how did she know that?</i>
yeah, how did she know that?
(lute playing)
(sniffles)
(gasps)
(princess pea crying)
despereaux: why
are you crying?
(gasps)
why are you crying?
down here.
(gasps) are you a rat?
no.
what are you? a mouse?
i am a gentleman.
(chuckles)
and how do you do?
you're sad.
yes.
because you have longing.
you're a strange little mouse.
thank you.
come on.
where did you hear that?
about the longing.
in a story.
a story? about what?
about a princess, like
you, in a castle, like this.
oh. you're a smooth
little mouse, aren't you?
bet you tell that to
all the princesses.
i am sworn to tell the truth.
it is a code of honor.
ah. not just a gentleman,
an honorable gentleman.
well, then, how
does this story end
with this princess
who's locked in a castle?
i don't know...
i haven't finished it yet.
i'd love to know.
oh, i wish it would rain.
i wish there was soup again.
i even wish there were rats!
will you promise me that?
will you promise to finish your
story and tell me how it ends?
yes. it will be my quest.
your quest! you are
a very brave mouse.
thank you, my good gentleman.
whoa!
whoa.
(exclaims)
whoa!
(exclaims)
<i>narrator: now, there are
all kinds of princesses.</i>
<i>some are born that way,</i>
<i>some marry into it,</i>
<i>and some are destined
to be princesses</i>

<i>but at one time or another,</i>
<i>every little girl
longs to be a princess.</i>
i'm gonna live right there.
right up there,
near the tippy-top.
quit your daydreaming
and feed those swine!
yes, i know. it's
gonna be all mine.
no, you deaf little urchin.
i said feed those swine!

<i>narrator: miggery sow
had been shoveling slop</i>
<i>for as long as
she could remember.</i>
<i>her uncle ned had put a shovel in her
hand from the minute she could hold one.</i>
<i>but it turned out all right</i>
<i>because she got on quite
nicely with the pigs.</i>
that's right.
i'm gonna have a special
room just for my dresses
and another whole closet
just for my knickers!
<i>in fact, miggery sow could
see her future so clearly.</i>
<i>she could see the tiara, the fancy
dresses, the maids-in-waiting,</i>
<i>and when things got
really bad around the farm,</i>
<i>she could see the moment that she would
finally be delivered from all of this.</i>
not long now.
i promise you that.
the sow, and 12 for the girl.
same as the sow.
i told you! i told you
i'd make it to the castle!
whoa!
<i>so sometimes, it doesn't take
much for your dreams to come true.</i>
<i>you just have to be
able to see it that way.</i>
she was beautiful!
like an angel.
furlough: you are crazy.
and she smelled so amazing.
like a garden.
despereaux!
you can't talk to a human.
that is the worst
thing you can do.
no, it's the best
thing i ever did.
they will throw
you in the dungeon.
you will get eaten by rats!
it would be worth it.
they could tear at my flesh.
oh, this is bad.
oh, and when she held
me in her hand, it was...
it was so soft, like
floating in a pillow.
you know what? i'm
worried about you.
that's the point, furlough.
there's nothing
to be afraid of.
quiet! they will hear you.
come on. just try it.
just for a second,
just try being brave.
- oh!
- and stop cowering!
what's going on in here?
what's all this talk about
princesses and bravery?
furlough, i want to see
you in my study, right now.
lester: are you sure?
furlough: that's what he said.
- a real human?
- a princess.
(sighs)
we need to tell them.
we need to tell
the mouse council.
- but they'ii...
- this is bad. this is very bad.
if they find out... if they find
out that they didn't find out...
oh, then they'll find
out that it was me who...
oh, no.
but they will send
him to the dungeon!
- oh, he'll get eaten by rats!
- oh!
no, not if we beg.
if we really beg and show
them that he's changed.
that he's afraid.
that he's afraid, and he's
turned into a real mouse.
despereaux!
<i>narrator: of course,
destiny is a funny thing.</i>
<i>we go out to meet it, and we
don't always know that we are.</i>

surround him!
mayor: despereaux tilling.

how long have you been
working on this book?
hmm... a week?
a week? you've
hardly cracked it.
well, i was...
i just wanted to
see how it ends.

training as a mouse.
refused to respect the will
and guidance of elder mice.
repeatedly engaged in
bold and un-meek behavior.
triggered willfully not
less than 17 mousetraps.
(crowd gasps)
just shameful!
had personal contact with...
with...
with a human being.
(crowd murmuring)
isn't there
something you can do?
antoinette, stop
right now! stop that.
you have to trust them.
they are the council.
they're the council because...
because they're the council.
they're the council.
is there anything you wish
to say in your defense?
well, it was a
very good story,
and she was a very
beautiful princess.
(crowd murmuring)
despereaux tilling,
our laws are here to protect
us and our way of life.
and when one of our citizens
strays from that way of life,
he becomes a threat to us all.
it's an easy question.
are you a man or
are you a mouse?
and your actions have told us
that you have a great deal
of trouble being a mouse.
it is the judgment
of this court
that you should be banished
from these walls forever.
you shall be remanded into the
custody of hovis, the threadmaster,
who will prepare you for your
descent into the dungeons of dor,
from which no mouse and
no light has ever escaped.
- shh!
- my baby!
quiet. be quiet, my dear.
there's nothing to be done.
come with me.
stand there.
red?
ah, so they tell me.
so you're the brave one.
i guess.
it's good. it'll
carry well down there.
wear it proudly.
there's no shame.
it's time.
it's all right. they're too
scared to come down here.
in there?
i'm afraid so.
courage, right?
and truth.
- and honor.
- good.
but especially courage.
i'm ready.
all right, then you need to...
(exclaims)
(groans)
what? whoa!
(snoring)
(rats chattering)
hello? hello?
(grumbles)
whoa!
(whistles)
lads, let's go, on the double!
(exclaims)
who is that?
who goes there?
who is that?
despereaux tilling.
are you a man or
are you a mouse?
i am a gentleman.
(chuckling) oh.
(rats clamoring)
- it's a mouse.
- i'm hungry.
shh! quiet, lads. patience.
and what makes
you a gentleman?
a code...
a code of honor.
(laughs)
you're a strange little
mouse, aren't you?
and where did you find
this code of honor?
well, in a legend.
a legend that i read.
fine. oh, tell me
this legend of yours.
i could do with a
good story right now.
well,
it's about a
princess and a knight
and his quest to
save her honor.
ah. it was a princess
that took away my soup.
she didn't take it.
in fact, she misses it, too!
(rats murmuring)
how do you know
all this, then?
i've seen her.
- seen her?
- i've talked to her.
- talked to her?
- that's why they sent me down here.
mmm-hmm. and what did
this princess tell you
when you had your
little audience?
(laughing) eh? eh?
oh, you must be a
royal mouse. is that it?
she told me that she
missed the soup and the rain
and, most of
all, the sunlight.
and that she just wanted
it all to come back again.
well, i don't want to
hear your little stories
about princesses and sunshine.
go tell them to the rats!
(grunts)
(rats murmuring)
all right, boys, come on!
(rats shouting)
(crowd cheering)
(grunting)
(laughing)
good crowd, isn't it, sir?
yes, it is, quite.
crowd: (chanting) mouse!
mouse! mouse! mouse!
ah, roscuro! i'm glad
you could make it.
i thought you didn't
like the arena.
huh? oh! no, no. it...
it's an honor, sir.
oh!
- botticelll: good.
- mmm.
well, enjoy.
(stammering) oh,
uh... thank you.
(crowd cheering)
let the games begin!

(crowd grumbling)
what?

one looks tasty.
well, this is progress.
perhaps we're starting to
leave the past behind us, eh?
enjoy, my friend.

(stammering) oh, i won't.
(snaps)

(whimpers)
(crowd grumbling)
(all clamoring)
come on, let's go, buster!
that's it. that's
it. you keep moving!
(whispering) it's
okay. keep walking.
come on, keep moving!
let's go, come on!
(whispering) it's
right up there.
- huh?
- keep walking.
- oh.
- see that?
light. real light.
it's mine, but
you can share it.
it isn't much, but there isn't much
anywhere since everything turned gray.
you're not gonna eat me?
no. i don't eat mice.
then what do you eat?
crumbs.
when i can find them.
so you are a gentleman.
tell me that story.
about the princess.
tell me what she looked like.
well, she was...
was she angry?
no.
no, not at all.
her heart was full of longing.
what's longing?
<i>narrator: and that's
how a friendship is born.</i>
<i>over the next few weeks, he told
roscuro everything he knew about loyalty</i>
<i>and honor and
chivalry and courage.</i>
<i>he told him about the princess,
and where her longing came from.</i>
<i>that she missed the rain and
the soup and even the rats.</i>
even the rats?
<i>narrator: he told him about their
code of honor, about his noble quest,</i>
<i>about duty and loyalty.</i>
<i>and there, in the
darkness of the cellar,</i>
<i>two knights pledged devotion to a
princess who was trapped inside a castle.</i>
<i>trapped in a life full
of pain and longing.</i>
<i>even if no one could tell.</i>
your crown, ma'am.
oh.
i don't want it today.
but it's beautiful, ma'am.
i know, but i don't want it.
you look so pretty
in it, ma'am.
like a princess.
i know. i am the princess.
oh, i know, ma'am,
but such a fine princess, with
a little, pretty, glittery...
i don't want it!
all right, mig?
very well, ma'am.
please, take it away.
mig: princess.
who's the princess?
i'm a princess.
i'm the princess.
my comb, my hat, my gloves
and my pretty powder
on my pretty princess face.
and what do you
think you're doing?
ma'am!
where did you get all this?
i just borrowed it, ma'am.
borrowed it?
i was gonna put them all back.
see that you do!
and you can spend
the whole week
taking slop to the dungeon
for your little escapade.
"princess"!
god! she's the princess.
(scoffs)
and now i have to carry the
sloppy, gloppy, stinky stew
down in the damp,
dark, dingy...
a person could get
lost forever down here.
oh!
(snoring)
din-din.
slop.
no, don't stop! i said "slop"!
(sighs)
how am i supposed
to eat this swill?
oh, stop that! i don't have
to be putting up with all this!
i serve the princess.
(laughing)
right. you serve the princess.
- that's a bit of a laugh, isn't it?
- i do.
- i bring her tea and...
- well, i don't want to hear it!
had me own little
princess once.
and now i don't.
oh. what, you had a princess?
yeah.
every dad's got a princess.
<i>gregory: till he stops
being a dad, of course.</i>
(baby cooing)
sorry. so, so, sorry!
oh, well, i've got a real one.
and she's got a
tiara and fancy robes,
and she's got shiny bits all
over every frock in her closet.
and i get to see
her every single day.
despereaux: what
kind of a quest?
uh...
to right a terrible wrong.
but who did you wrong?
okay.
do you remember when
they banished the rats?
- sure. yes.
- okay.
well, it wasn't all
the rats they banished.
i mean, they did, but it was
all because of one particular rat
in particular.
oh.
mmm-hmm.
if i could just
tell her i'm sorry,
that i'm, you know,
i'm really sorry.
and that i didn't mean
for any of this to happen.
if she could just
hear me say it,
you know, just...
just hear my voice,
(stammering) she would
know how much i meant it.
that is a very noble quest.
roscuro: (stammering)
your highness?
your highness?
is that you?
my little mouse?
oh, i'm not a mouse. i...
(stammering) i'm a...
oh.
i forgot.
you're my little
gentleman, aren't you?
have you come to tell
me how the story ends?
did you finish your quest?
where are you?
i have come to apologize.
oh, you are noble, remember?
you have nothing
to be sorry about.
oh, but i am.
i am sorry.
(gasping) i know you.
- no, no.
- oh, no!
no! please, please
listen. please.
- a rat!
- please. i just want to tell you.
(screaming) someone, please!
listen. it's okay.

a rat in my room!
please get him off!
(screaming)

(princess pea shrieking)

(princess pea shrieking)
oh!
princess pea: it's a rat!
guard 1: quick, rush him!
guard 2: get him!
guard 3: filthy rodent!
uh-oh.
oh!
guard: where'd he go?
(grunting)
(panting)
<i>narrator: what would you do if
your own name was a bad word?</i>
<i>if john or beth or
bill was an insult.</i>
<i>well, that's how roscuro
came to feel about who he was.</i>
<i>when your heart breaks,
it can grow back crooked.</i>
<i>it grows back twisted
and gnarled and hard.</i>
<i>even as he changed,
roscuro still had longing.</i>
<i>but now he just longed for someone
whose heart was as hardened as his was.</i>
pretty princess. pretty,
pretty princess pie.
what a pretty princess!
my gloves.
my comb.
my jewel-y, girly hat,
all sitting on
my princess head.
who's the pretty
princess pumpkin pie?
you are.
right. i am.
you are. and you should be
dressed in those clothes.
quite right. i should.
mmm-hmm. and you should
lounge in that bed.
lounging.
lounging round,
yes, the whole day!
and you should be
wearing that crown.
i should be wearing a frown?
no. no, no, no. not
a frown. a crown.

me own self think.
- ah!
- shh!
- ah!
- shh!
shh!
- ah!
- shh!
who are you?
i'm here to help you.
i can't be caught with
a real rat in my bunk.
i don't think so.
(inhales)
and what if they find you with
a painting of the princess?
you think that's
as bad as a rat?
i want the same thing you do.
(clanking)
<i>allo?</i>
(both exclaiming)
what are you doing?
uh...
i need it for a baby.
no, not a baby!

(stammering) i mean milady.

now turn and leave.
now turn and leave.
no, no! just turn and leave.
oh, right. sorry.
sorry. bye.
oh, i can't hear you,
see, because deaf, but...
a bit deaf.
<i>narrator: you know,
hurt is a funny thing.</i>
<i>the same thing that makes one person
angry can put another person into grief.</i>
here, take care of
me little princess.
i can't no more.
oh, i will. don't worry.
(baby cooing)
i'm sorry.
sorry. so, so sorry!
<i>narrator: gregory always said
that she had too much heart.</i>
<i>and that's why they had to
put some of it on the outside.</i>
<i>but let's face it.</i>
<i>it's hard to see
something on your back.</i>
<i>in fact, you can have a good
heart and not even know it.</i>
you can do this.
you know you can.
i know i can.
she belongs in the dungeon, and you
belong in the palace, like a princess.
(clattering)
what are you doing?
i'm cleaning, ma'am.
(groans)
with rope?
it helps, ma'am.
well, stop it. you
look ridiculous.
sorry, ma'am?
i said you look ridiculous.
<i>(echoing) ridiculous,
ridiculous, ridiculous.</i>

amount of trouble.

<i>narrator: okay, remember
when we said that grief</i>
<i>was the strongest thing
a person could feel?</i>
<i>well, it isn't.</i>
<i>it's forgiveness.</i>
<i>because a single act of
forgiveness can change everything.</i>
no.
what?
no.
you worthless little...
crowd: eat! eat! eat!

i'm so, so sorry. you've
no idea how sorry i am.
that's all right.
(townspeople cheering)
i'm so sorry.
<i>narrator: so, you
could call all of this</i>
<i>a big misunderstanding
if you wanted to.</i>
<i>a king was hurt,
so he hurt a rat.</i>
<i>and a rat was hurt,
so he hurt a princess.</i>
<i>and a princess was hurt,
so she hurt a servant girl,</i>
<i>without even meaning to do it.</i>
<i>and that servant had
been hurting for so long,</i>
<i>that almost nothing could
make her feel better.</i>
<i>but was it a mistake or
was it just good luck?</i>
<i>because the servant girl
went back to her farm.</i>
<i>and the jailer finally
found his princess.</i>
<i>and the king found something
stronger than grief.</i>
<i>and the mice finally
got rid of their fear.</i>
<i>and the people of dor lived
side by side with their rats.</i>
<i>all except one.</i>
<i>who went back to sea</i>
<i>and felt a cool
breeze each morning</i>
<i>and the sun in his
face every afternoon.</i>
<i>and we'd tell you that they all
lived happily ever after, but...</i>
whoa!
<i>narrator: what fun is that?</i>
whoa!
