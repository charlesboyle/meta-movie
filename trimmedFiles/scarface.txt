that is disgusting.
- watch.
- eeew, look at that fucking thing.

like a bug coming out of your mouth.
[chuckles]
that figures you wouldn't understand.
but the women in this country,
when you do that, they know.
- they know what?
- they understand.
they-- they go crazy.
lt'll take a lot of practice,
but you gotta learn, because women love
when you suck the pussy.
look at that.
¡ay, coño!

[manny]

- go ahead. you think
you can do it with her?
- l think l can.

stick his tongue out to that girl.
- look at that. ¡ay, coño!
- you're sick!

- you know, if l wasn't
a nice guy, l'd crack you.
- she's too big for you.
- causing trouble like that. come on.
- bitch!
- what l try to tell you?
- lesbian!
what l try to tell you? this country,
you gotta make the money first.
then when you get the money,
you get the power.
then when you get the power,
then you get the woman.
that's why you gotta
make your own moves.
that's the one l rented.
no, no, no. they-- they--
that's her, man. there she is.
- oh, oh, oh.
- 'bout time.
frank got held up at the golf course.
he told me to pick you up.
uh, he said he'd meet us
at the track later.
he said to bet on lce cream
in the first, by the way.
ln that thing?
you must be kidding.
what you talkin' about?
that's a cadillac.
- l wouldn't be
caught dead in that thing.
- aw, come on.
hey, you know, l mean,
it's got a few years.
- [chuckles]
- but it's a cream puff.
lt looks like
somebody's nightmare.
so, you like this better?
yeah.

from lndia, huh?
- tigers, no?
crazy guy.
you know what he's been doin'?
dragging me to the zoo
to look at tigers.
he says he's gonna buy one now.
you do that, and you're not
gonna have any friends left.
- not that you have any now--
- you're gonna like that tiger, man.
you gonna drive around with a tiger
in your passenger seat?
maybe. some lady tiger.
- how much?
- 43,000, fully equipped.

bullet-proof this, okay?
and this here and here.
- [manny] okay.
- and the windows.
okay.
- and get me one of them phones,
you know, with a scrambler.
- and a scrambler.
and a radio with scanners, to pick out
flying saucers, stuff like that.
- don't forget the fog lights.
- oh!
ln case l get caught in the swamp.
that's a good idea.
[horn blaring]
get out of the way, lady!
l'm tryin' to drive here!
l thought you were
taking me to frank.
we got an hour.
you hungry?
no, but l'm bored.

and pay the guy.
- yeah.
and, uh, you take a taxi.

if you didn't like it.
plannin' on driving the girls crazy,

and what would frank say?
l like frank, you know?
only l like you better.
[snorting]
- you got some for me?
- sure.
- [tapping]
- okay.
[snorting]
- [mutters]
- okay.
don't get confused, tony.
l don't fuck around with the help.
okay.
you wanna play that way with me,
l play with you.

- would you kiss me if l wear the hat?
- no!
playtime is over, okay?
[laughing]
okay.
[knocking]
mamá.
antonio.
long time.
no postcards from jail?
¡coño! gina.
[gasps]
tony?
- oh, man, look at you. [chuckles]
- [laughs]
hey, you're beautiful.
- l didn't--
- mamá, look at those eyes, huh?
- look at that. she looks like me.
- [chuckles]
you know the last time l saw you,
you was like that.
you looked like a little boy.
but now look at you.
uh, l got something for you.
[exhales deeply]
for you.
this no big deal.
oh, tony!
[crying]
- [laughs]
- oooh, tony!
l never thought
l'd see you again, you know?
you think they're gonna keep
a guy like me down?
well, no.
[laughs] no.
[sighs]
you look so good.
look. you open that up.
open it.
- for me?
- l think so.
lt's nothing much,
you know. nothing.
- [sighs]
- see?
do you see what's written
on the back?
on the back?
[sighs]
- ''always.''
- ''always.'' lt's beautiful, tony!
so mamá is still working
in the factory,
and l'm working part-time
in a beauty parlor.
l'm doing hair, tony.
do you remember hiram gonzález?
his father owned that barbershop.
lt's his place.
plus l go to junior college.
miami dade.
and in two more years,
l get my cosmetology license.
- and then l'll be making enough money--
- surprise!
all that's over...
starting today.
- why?
- my kid sister don't have to work
in no beauty parlor,
and mamá, she don't have to sew
in no factory.
your son made it, mamá.
he's a success.
that's why l didn't
come around before.
l want you to see
what a good boy l been.
here's a thousand dollars.
for you, mamá.
[clears throat]
- who did you kill for this, antonio?
- mamá.
l didn't kill nobody, mamá.
- no?
- no.
what are you doing now?
banks, or is it still bodegas,
you and the others?
no! things are different now.
l'm working
with an anti-castro group.
l'm an organizer now, and l get
a lot of political contributions.
sure you do.
a gun sticking
in somebody's face is how.
you know, all we hear about
in the papers...
is animals like you
and the killings.
lt's cubans like you who are giving
a bad name to our people.
people who come here, work hard
and make a good name for themselves.
- people who send
their children to school--
- mamá! what are you saying?
- that's your son!
- [shouts] son?
- l wish l had one. he's a bum.
- no. no.
he was a bum then,
and he's a bum now.
who do you think
you are, hmm?
we haven't heard a word
from you in five years.
cinco años.
you suddenly show up here,
throw some money around...
and think you can get
my respect.
-you think you can buy me with jewelry?
-come on, mamá.
you think you can come into my house
with your hotshot clothes...
and your jail manners
and make fun of us?
- mamá, you don't know
what you're talking about.
- that's not the way l am!
that is not the way
l raised gina to be!
you are not going
to destroy her.
l don't need your money.
gracias.
l work for my living.
l don't want you
in this house anymore!
l don't want you around gina.
so, come on. get out!
okay.
- no. mamá--
- and take this lousy money with you.
- lt stinks.
- tony--
why do you have to spoil it
for everybody, huh?
l'm sorry, tony.
okay, mamá.
oh, no, no.
tony, wait a minute!
- don't go, please!
- gina, stay here!
- [gina] no, no, no, mamá--
- [mamá] he's no good. gina!
- tony, wait, please!
- gina!
l'm sorry. l don't know, mamá--
ever since papá left she's--
forget papá.
we never had one.
l know you did
some bad things back then.
ln the army, l know
you got into some trouble.
the communists, they're always trying
to tell you what to do.
- mamá doesn't understand that.
- l know.
l just-- l don't know. l just want you
to know, you know, l don't care.
lt doesn't matter to me how long
you've been away, five or ten years.
you're my blood, always.
l know. l know.
- come on. come on.
l want you to take this.
- l gotta go back in.
- no, tony. please. tony.
- you need this. come on.
- what am l gonna tell her?
- take that. you don't
tell her anything.
don't tell her l give it to you,
but give her some from time to time.
and listen, you go out yourself,
you know?
go ahead, go out, do some things.
have some fun.
you gotta get some fun
out of life.
you gonna beat yourself to death at 19?
pussycat like you?
- come here.
- mmm.
- l'll talk to you again, all right?
- okay.
- put that money away.
don't let her see it.
- l'll talk to her.
- okay. l'll talk to you.
- [train whistle blowing]
okay.
okay, let's go.
she's beautiful.
- how come you--
- hey!
stay away from her, man.
you hear?
- she not for you.
- okay.
so this and my other factory,
l can guarantee production...
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.
the problem is
l have no steady market.
basically, what l'm looking for
is somebody in the states...
who can share the risk with me,
somebody who can guarantee
to buy from me, say, 150 kilos a month.
oh! that's a big commitment,
mr. sosa.
something like that, uh--
lt's too bad frank's not here.
you should talk to him.
- lt would've been nice
if he could have come.
- he would like to come,
but with his trial coming up, it's hard
for him to get out of the country.
- so he sent you instead?
- yeah, something like that.
we'll talk at my house,
shall we?
you got good stuff here.
class 'a' shit.
so this lópez guarantees to buy from me
he picks it up here.
l can sell it to him for as little as,
uh... 7,000 a key.
you cannot do better than that.
yeah, but then we gotta
take the risk of moving it.
also, we'll be cutting out the
colombians. you know what that means?
that means we have
to go to war with them.
we cut out the colombians,
we take risks on both sides.
why don't we split the risk?
you guarantee your delivery,
say, as far as panama.
we take it from there.
panama is risky.
lt costs me more.
panama l can sell for...
what, are you nuts?
that shit to florida, man.
do you know what that's like
these days? you got the fucking navy.
you got frogmen. you got ec-2s
with the satellite-tracking shit.
you got the fucking
bell 209 assault choppers up the ass.
we're losing one
out of every nine loads.
that's no duck walk anymore, man,
let me tell you.
forget about 13.5.
- [phone ringing]
- well,
what do you suggest
that is reasonable?
[ringing continues]
excuse me one moment.
hey, montana, what the fuck's
the matter with you?
- you negotiating for frank lópez, huh?
- don't worry about it.
- take it easy.
- l'm not worried about it.
you should worry about it. lf he wants
to make a deal, it's up to him, not you.
- we're gonna do
this one deal. that's it.
- fuck you. how's that?
- fuck you.
- fuck you.
[omar] you need to open your eyes
and keep your mouth shut.
- that's it. let it go at that.
- don't worry about it.
your head is in the wrong place.
you got to watch out for yourself.
why don't you talk to him
about it? you think he
wants to give you the money?
- shut the fuck up.
- l'm doing the talking here, not you.
you're here to watch my back.
watch my back.
better than your front, let me tell you.
that's easier to watch.
[omar]
close your mouth.
l can't wait to see what frank's
gonna react to this one.
just shut up.
l'm doing the talking here.
- now where were we?
- panama.
you're looking
for a partner, right?
something like that.
look, mr. sosa,
we're getting ahead of ourselves here.
l am down on frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.
that's my limit.
l got no right--
- nobody got no right
to negotiate for frank--
- let the man finish, okay?
let him propose a proposition;
then we can talk more.
you got no authority here.
l started you in this fucking business,
so shut the fuck up.
- frank is gonna love it.
don't worry about it.
- that's up to frank, not you!
l'm sorry about this, mr. sosa.
no, it is all right.
you're right.
maybe you should talk to frank.
well, good.
l don't think it's something
l wanna do on an overseas phone.
but as soon as l get back to miami,
l will talk to frank personally.
good.
my associates here
can escort you to my chopper.
my chopper can take you
to santa cruz.
l have a jet there,
can have you in miami in five hours.
you should be back here tomorrow
in time for lunch.
good. good. good.
good. good. good.
hasta mañana.
good talking to you.
why don't you leave
your friend here?
while you are gone, maybe he can
tell me how to run my business.
- l think frank would like to see him--
- no, that's okay.
you tell frank l keeping
this guy on ice for him.
- [chuckling]
- [chuckling]
l guess so.
[sosa]
let's finish our lunch.
l have to hand it
to you, mr. sosa.
you got everything
a man could want.
l like you, tony.
there is no lying in you.
unfortunately, l do not feel the same
about the rest of your organization.
[helicopter whirring overhead]
what do you mean
by that, mr. sosa?
l'm talking about omar suárez.
- this garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch...
- [helicopter whirring]
from several years ago
in new york.
he was an informer
for the police.
[omar screaming]
[sosa] he put vito duval
and the ramos brothers, nello and gino,
away for life.
so how do l know you're not
a chivato too, tony?
hey, sosa.
let's get this straight now.
l never fucked anybody over in my life
didn't have it comin' to him.
you got that?
all l have in this life
is my balls and my word,
and l don't break 'em for no one,
you understand?
that piece of shit up there,
l never like him, l never trusted him.
for all l know, he had me set up and had
my friend, ángel fernández, killed.
but that's history.
l'm here, he's not.
you wanna go on with me, say it.
you don't, then you make a move.
l think you speak
from the heart, montana.
but l say to myself,
this lópez, your boss,
he had chivatos like that
working for him.
his judgment stinks.
so l think to myself, how many
other mistakes has this lópez guy made?
how can l trust his organization?
you tell me, tony.
frank is smart, you know?
you can't blame him
for that animal.
lt's a crazy business we're in,
you know?
that could happen to anyone,
even you.
why don't l go back
and talk to frank...
and work it out?
l fix things between us.
you got my word on it.
l think you and me,
we can work this thing out,
we do business together
a long time.
just remember--
l'll only tell you one time--
don't fuck me, tony.
don't you ever try to fuck me.
you what?
you made a deal
for a fucking $18 million...
without even checking with me?
are you crazy, montana?
are you crazy?
- coño, frank. take it easy.
- ¡coño, my ass!
at 10.5 a key, it's puro.
you can't lose money.
no way.
we make 75 million
on this deal, frank.
seventy-five million.
that is serious money.
what the fuck is sosa
going to do when l don't come up
with the first five million?
what is he gonna do?
ls he gonna send me a bill?
he's gonna send
a fucking hit squad up here!
relax! take it easy.
l'm in tight with sosa.
you short a couple of mil,
l go on the street for you.
l make a couple of moves,
a mil here, a mil there,
you got it.
okay?
oh, you've been making moves
on your own, huh?
l got ears, you know?
l hear things.
yeah?
what do you hear about echevierra
and the díaz brothers?
what about gaspar gómez?
what is he gonna do when you
start moving 2,000 keys--
fuck gaspar gómez and fuck
the fucking díaz brothers!
fuck 'em all!
l bury those cockroaches!
what they ever do for us?
look, frank, the time has come.
we gotta expand.
the whole operation.
distribution.
new york, chicago, l.a.
we gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.
we gotta think big now.
think big.
like your friend sosa.
let me tell you something about
that greaseball cocksucker.
he is a snake,
that's what he is.
you turn your back on him,
he'll stick it in.
you don't trust a guy like that.
you want me to believe...
omar was a stoolie
because sosa said so?
you bought that line.
maybe l made a mistake
sending you down there.
maybe you and sosa
know something l don't know.
like what?
like what?
[chuckling]
you tell me like what?
you calling me a liar, frank?
that what you calling me?
let's just say l want things
to stay the way they are for now.
you stall your deal with sosa.
stall him?
okay, boss.
come on.
l am the boss.
- sure, you're the boss.
- hey, tony.
remember l told you
when you started...
the guys who last
in this business...
are the guys who fly straight--
low-key, quiet.
and the guys who want it all--
chicas, champagne, flash--
they don't last.
you finished?
can l go now?
[birds calling]
hi there.
tony.
you just missed frank.
oh, yeah?
too bad.
only l didn't come to see frank.
this is not the time
or the place, tony.
- next time, make an appointment first.
- that's okay.
l got something important
l want to talk to you about.
okay?
so why don't we have
a couple of drinks,
act normal...
and just take it easy, huh?
come on. l like scotch.
- sure. why not?
- okay. l won't bite you.
we're all normal here.
[lce cubes clinking]
l heard you and frank
aren't working together anymore.
that's right.
l think it's easier, don't you?
makes things easier.
well, uh--
thank you.
here's to the land of opportunity.
for you, maybe.
- you like kids?
- kids?
kids. you know, kid.
little kids.
[sighs] sure. why not?
as long as there's a nurse.
good, 'cause l like kids too.
l like 'em. boys, girls.
don't matter to me.
[sighs]
look, frank's gonna be back any minute.
come here.
come on. come on.
sit here.
l want to talk to you. sit down.
l'm not gonna bite you.
okay, here's the story.
l come from the gutter.
l know that.
l got no education,
but that's okay.
l know the street, and l'm making
all the right connections.
with the right woman,
there's no stopping me.
l could go right to the top.
anyway, what l got
to tell you is this:
l like you.
l like you the first time
l laid eyes on you.
l say, ''she's a tiger.
[chuckles]
she belong to me.''
anyway...
l want you to marry me.
l want you to be
the mother of my children.
me? marry you?
that's right.
[sighs]
what about frank, tony?
what are you gonna do about frank?
frank is not gonna last, okay?
he's finished.
just think about it, okay?
l want you
to really think about it.
okay? l go now.
take care.

no, not lately. what about
ancient history, like emilio rebenga?
or a bunch of whacked-out lndians
at the sun ray motel?
mel, who's ever giving you
your information is taking you
for a long ride.
- oh, yeah?
- yeah.

your wise-ass spic balls here and now?
[woman singing]
/ turn out the night /
/ l can be strong //
keep your eye on her.
- l'll do that.
- okay.
- my office.
- good.
the word on the street
is you're bringing in a lot of yeyo.
that means you're not
a small-time punk anymore.
you're public property now.
supreme court says
your privacy can be invaded.
okay. how much?
how much?
well, there's an answer to that too.
here's how much.
can you see it?
- big number.
- yeah!
that's on a monthly basis,
same thing every month.
you know how this works?
no. you tell me.
we tell you
who's moving against you,
and we shake down
who you want shaken down.
let's say that you got
a real problem making a collection.
hmm? and then
we step in for you.
got eight killers with badges working
for me. when they hit, it hurts.
same thing works the other way.
you feed me a bust now and then--
some cowboy setting himself up
in business.
small-fry, you know?
[sighs]
we like snacks.
how do l know you're the last cop
l'm gonna have to grease?
what about fort lauderdale?
metro? d.e.a.?
how do l know what rock
they're gonna crawl out from under?
well, it's not my business, tony,
you know? we don't cross no lines.
[chuckles] listen, you think
l want this conversation...
going any farther
than this table?
my guys got families.
they're legitimate cops.
l don't wanna see them embarrassed.
lf they're embarrassed,
they're gonna suffer.
lf they suffer,
they're gonna make you suffer.
- comprende?
you understand what
l'm talking about? huh?
[crowd chattering]
/ she's on fire, fire, fire /
thank you for the drink.
oh, by the way,
l got a vacation coming up.
l'm gonna take the wife
to london, england.
we've never been there.
so, throw in a couple
of round-trip tickets,
first class, okay?
you oughta smile more, tony.
you gotta enjoy yourself.
every day above ground
is a good day.
hello.
hello.
yeah.
now that's the idea.
okay, mel.
you think about what l said?
about the kids? hmm?
- you know, you are really nuts.
you know that, tony?
- l'm nuts about you.
hey, tony, why don't you
find your own girl?
- my own girl?
- yeah.
- that's what l'm doing.
- go do it somewhere else. get lost.
maybe l don't hear
so good sometime.
- you're not going to be hearing
anything if you go on.

you mixing with those people,
growing up to be like him.
he has this father thing for you.
he feels like he has to protect you.
protect me against what?
against guys like that asshole
that you were dancing with tonight.
hey, l like fernando.
he's a fun guy and he's nice.
and he knows how to treat
a woman. all right?
he knows how to treat
a woman? by taking you
to the toilet to make out?
you've been a great audience. calm down.
l got a special treat for you.
here's a guy l found strolling in the
jungle. he's from caracas, venezuela.

how, with a small law enforcement
budget, can you put a dent...
on an estimated
$100 billion-a-year business?
lt seems at times all you can do
is put your finger in the dike and pray.
put your fingers in a dike?
the only place you can
get your fingers in some dyke.
not by outlawing the substances,
but by legalizing and taxing them.
these voices say that will drive out
the organized crime element.
l am not one of those voices.
l know that.
but you know why, vic?
'cause you got your head
up your culo, that's why.

ah, that's pretty cute. look at that.
he jerk off in front of us, seidelbaum?
l was supposed to meet
this chick at 3:00. you're
a fuckin' pain in the ass.
all right, danny, kill it.
you understand the rights
l've given you?
l know all that bullshit, seidelbaum!
save your breath.
you got nothin' on me.
you know it! l know it!
l'm changin' dollar bills,
that's all.
you wanna waste my time?
okay. l call my lawyer.
he's the best lawyer in miami.
he's such a good lawyer,
that by tomorrow morning,
you gonna be working in alaska.
so dress warm.
[sheffield] give me a check for
a hundred grand, plus 300 in cash,
and l guarantee you walk
on the conspiracy charge.
but they're gonna come back at us
on a tax evasion, and they'll get it.
so... what am l
lookin' at here?
five years.
you'll be out in three.
maybe less, if l can make a deal.
three fuckin' years!
for what?
washing money? the fuckin' country
was built on washed money.
- lt can't be that bad.
lt's not like cuba.
- what the fuck you talking?
- the jails are like hotels.
- you kidding me or what?
- you fuckin' high or what?
- l'll delay the trial.
a year and a half, two years.
you won't even start--
hey, fuck you, man!
l'm not going back in any cage, okay?
no way. l been there.
okay, look.
[clears throat]
l give you $400,000 more.
okay, now that's $800,000.
with that kind of money,
you can buy the supreme court.
tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.
l'm an expert
at raisin' that doubt.
but when you a got
a million-three undeclared dollars...
staring into a videotape camera,
honey, baby, it's hard to convince
a jury you found it in a taxicab.
[lce cubes rattle]
- [sosa] tony.
- alex.
tony, l'm so glad you could
come on such short notice.
l really appreciate it.
- lt's okay.
- how's elvira?
- ah, great. how's your wife?
- three more months.
- oh, yeah? congratulations.
- how 'bout you?
when you gonna have another tony
to take your place?
- l'm working on it.
- you have to work harder. come.
l want you to meet
some of my friends.
this is pedro quinn,
chairman of the andes sugar corporation.
- pleasure meeting you, mr. montana.
- nice to meet you.
general edward strasser, commander of
the first army corps. tony montana.
- mucho gusto, amigo.
- pleasure.
this is ariel bleyer with the ministry
of the lnterior here. tony montana.
bienvenido.
and here is our friend, charles goodson
from washington. this is tony montana.
- how do you do?
- how do you do, mr. montana?
[sosa]
sit here, tony.
gentlemen.
l would like to discuss something
that is of interest to all of us here.
you have a problem, tony.
we... have a problem.
l think together
we can solve all our problems.
we all know that you have
tax troubles in your country...
and that you may have
to do a little time.
but we have some friends
in washington that assure us
these troubles can be taken care of.
you may have to pay
some back taxes, a big fine,
but, uh,
there will be no prison.
okay.
so what's your problem, alex?
l'll show you my problem.
[reporter]
l've heard whispers about financial
support your government receives...
from the drug industry
in bolivia.
well, the irony of this is that
this money, which is in the billions,
is coming from your country.
you are the major purchaser
of our national product,
which is cocaine.
on one hand you're saying
the united states government...
is spending millions of dollars
to eliminate the flow of drugs
onto our streets.
at the same time, we are doing business
with the same government...
that is flooding
our streets with cocaine.
sí. let me show you
a few of the other characters...
that are involved
in this tragicomedy.
my organization just recently
traced a large purchase...
by this man.
this charming face here
belongs to general cucombre.
he is the minister of the defense
of bolivia, my country.
and general cucombre just
a couple of months ago...
bought a $12 million villa
on lake lucerne in switzerland.
now, if cucombre is supposed to be
the bolivian defense minister,
what is he doing living in switzerland,
guarding cash registers?
this man here,
alejandro sosa,
a very interesting character.
he's a wealthy landowner,
educated in england, very good family.
but this man is the business brain
and drug overlord...
of an empire that stretches
across the andes.
he's not your ordinary drug dealer.
[reporter]
well, discussing it openly--
[tape stops]
he is scheduled
for 60 minutes next.
he is going on french,
british, ltalian,
japanese television.
people everywhere
are starting to listen to him.
lt's embarrassing, tony.
- yeah.
- that is our problem.
you remember alberto, don't you?
how could l forget him?
alberto is an expert
in the disposal business.
he's going to help us
fix our problem.
but he doesn't speak english.
he doesn't know his way
around the states too well.
he needs a little help.
ls that a problem, tony?
no problem.
good.
[people chattering]
so what's the big mystery
with the bolivian situation?
you gonna tell me
what happened with sosa or what?
- a lotta bullshit, that what happened.
- [laughs]
politics.
okay. l want you to stay
down here for a while.
run things for me.
l gotta go to new york next week.
okay?
[clears throat]
fuck this, man.
l don't like it, man.
l don't like this at all.
you don't like it?
okay.
you the one that got me into this mess
in the first place, you know that?
- oh, yeah?
- with that fuckin' seidelbaum,
that right?
with seidelbaum? man, what does
seidelbaum have to do with sosa?
how you connect those two?
- [sniffing]
- why don't you eat your food?
what's wrong with it?
- l'm not hungry.
- you're not hungry?
you even know about the trial?
- what did you order it for then?
- l lost my appetite.
do you even know that sheffield said
he can get you a postponement?
- [manny] - eh?
- [sniffing]
ls this it? that's what
it's all about, manny?
eating, drinking,
fucking, sucking?
- come on, man. [snickers]
- snorting?
then what?
tell me.
then what?
you're 50.
you got a bag for a belly.
you got tits; you need a bra.
they got hair on 'em.
you got a liver,
and they got spots on it,
and you're eatin'
this fuckin' shit,
and you're lookin' like
these rich fuckin' mummies in here.
come on. lt's not so bad.
lt could be worse.
- ls this what it's all about?
- forget it.
this what l work for?
tell me.
¡coño!
look at that.
a junkie.
l got a fuckin' junkie for a wife.
she don't eat nothin'.
sleeps all day...
with them black shades on.
- wakes up with a quaalude,
- don't pick on her, man.
and who won't fuck me
'cause she's in a coma.
l can't even have
a kid with her, manny.
her womb is so polluted,
l can't even have
a fuckin' little baby with her!
- don't start that.
- [whispering] you son of a bitch!
- you fuck!
- you shouldn't talk like that.
how dare you talk to me like that!
what makes you
so much better than me?
- what do you do?
- don't worry.
you deal drugs and you kill people.
oh, that's wonderful, tony.
real contribution
to human history.
- go ahead. tell everybody.
- you want a kid?
- tell the world.
- what kind of a father
do you think you'd make!
- [shouting]
- gonna drive him to school
in the mornings?
are you even gonna be alive
by the time the kid goes to school?
- you don't even know
how to be a husband!
- sit down before l--
do we ever go anywhere without having
six thugs hanging around all the time?
- lt's okay.
- l have nick the pig as a friend.
- what kind of life is that?
- come on.
can't you see...
what we're becoming, tony?
we're losers.
we're not winners;
we're losers.
go home. you're stoned.
l'm not stoned; you're stoned.
- hey, get her outta here.
- come on.
no. no.
l'm not going home with you.
[sighs]
l'm not going home with anybody.
l'm going home alone.
l'm leaving you.
[patrons whispering]
l don't need this shit anymore.
okay, but l'll walk you out.
l'll take her home in a cab.
let her go.
let her go, man.
another quaalude,
she gonna love me again.
what you lookin' at?
you all a bunch
of fuckin' assholes.
you know why?
you don't have the guts
to be what you wanna be?
you need people like me.
you need people like me
so you can point your fuckin' fingers...
and say,
''that's the bad guy.''
so... what that make you?
good?
you're not good.
you just know how to hide--
how to lie.
me, l don't have that problem.
me, l always tell the truth.
even when l lie.
so say good night
to the bad guy!
come on.
the last time you gonna see a bad guy
like this again, let me tell you.
come on.
make way for the bad guy.
there's a bad guy comin' through!
better get outta his way!
[tony]
yeah, yeah.
no, no. you tell sheffield
to keep his nose out of it.
there's gonna be no trial.
l got it all under control now.
just tell him to stay out of it!
okay, what about elvira?

yeah, all right.
