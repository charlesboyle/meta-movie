- forced? by who?
- lord farquaad!
he huffed und he puffed

well, not my problem.
now you all need to turn around
and go back where you came from.
go back? we can't go back!
farquaad will turn us
into bratwurst!
oh! the guy's bad news.
hey, maybe
you could talking to him, huh?
yeah, he'd listen to you!
you're big and scary.
i'm also an ogre,
which means i stay on my swamp
and avoid large crowds.
or haven't you read the stories?
ha! you mean those stories that say
that i'm a big, bad wolf?
- oh yeah! that's so funny!
- hey...
and the ones that say
i'm a wicked witch?
or... or the ones that say
that i'm a "wooden boy."
what? i'm not a wooden boy.
i have a glandular condition.
look here, ogre,
i'm gonna spell it out for you.
we don't want us here
any more than you do.

mm... by the order
of lord farquaad,
i am authorized
to place you both under arrest!
under arrest, eh?
i want to go home right now!
this is the part where you run away.
and don't come back!
can i just say? that was incredible.
man, they were trippin' over
themselves to get away from you.
- i like that.
- oh, good, i'm glad.
now, why don't you go celebrate
your narrow escape with your friends.
- but i don't have any friends.
- now there's a shocker.
say, you lost or something?
no, i'm just trying to figure out
the best route to duloc.
oh. duloc?
i know duloc.
you gotta let me show you the way,
because i am like a gps with fur!
- i'll be fine on my own, thanks.
- but nobody's fine on their own!
not when you look like we do!
hey! didn't you hear
what they said?
man, this place is goin' stepford!
we gotta join forces!
otherwise they'll lock me up,
and i cannot go back in a cage!
i don't know if i
mentioned this or not,
but i did six years in solitary
for impersonating a piñata.
oh! that was really scary.
and if that don't work,
if you don't mind my saying,
your breath will
certainly get the job done.
listen, little donkey,
take a look at me. what am i?
- really green?
- no! i'm an ogre!
you know,
grab your torch and pitchforks!
- doesn't that bother you?
- nope.
- really?
- really, really.
- oh.
- damn, i like you. what's your name?
- shrek.
-  shrek?
well, you know
what i like about you, shrek?
you got that whole, "i don't care
what anybody thinks of me" thing.
i like that.
i respect that, shrek.

ah, yes, duloc is a wondrous land,

you are not a king, my liege,

what i mean is, you're not a king yet,

marry a princess.

and now, good people of duloc,
the moment you've all been waiting for.
the raffle drawing to determine who
will have the honor of setting forth
to rescue the lovely princess fiona
from the fiery keep of the dragon!
- spin that barrel!
- excuse me.
- no, come on!
- don't leave me!
- no, no...
-  no, no, no, no!
- hey, are you lord farquaad?
- ah!
maybe.
does the name
strike fear in your heart?
no, but that little hat does.
who let this thing in here?
look, i'll be out of your silky hair
as soon as you give me my swamp back.
- your swamp?
- yes, where you dumped
- those fairy-tale creatures.
- news flash, ogre,
that oozing mud pit is actually
within the province of duloc,
therefore under my jurisdiction.
- now look here, half-pint!
- wait a minute.
wait a minute.
- oh, this is too perfect.
- what is?
you! you're big and hulking
and wonderfully expendable.
people of duloc,
we have a winner!
congratulations, ogre.
you've won the honor of embarking
on a great and noble quest!
- but we're already on a quest.
- to get my swamp back!
yes, and you've nearly
accomplished it!
all you need to do
is one more simple little task,
and i'll hand over
the deed to your swamp.
and what exactly is
this little task?
there's just this package
that i need picked up.
miss duloc, fill them in
and show them out!

little task, my hoof!
rescue a princess? fight a dragon?
man, we got jacked!
we? i don't remember inviting a
donkey on this leg of the journey.
i don't get it, shrek.
why didn't you just make him
give you your swamp back?
ooh! pull some of that
ogre stuff on him.
you know, throttle him,
lay siege to his fortress.
- the whole ogre trip.
- for your information,
there's a lot more to ogres
than people think.
- hm. example?
- example. ok.
ogres are like onions.
- they stink?
- yes. no!
- uh, they make you cry?
- no!
you leave them out in the sun,
they get all brown
and start sprouting
little white hairs.
no! layers.
onions have layers.
ogres have layers.
onions have layers. you get it?
we both have layers!
<i>oh... you both got layers.</i>
but you know,
not everybody likes onions.
parfaits! everybody likes parfaits,
and they have layers!
have you ever met a person that said,
"hey, let's get some parfaits,"
and they be like,
"hell no, i don't like no parfaits!"
- parfaits are delicious.
- i don't care!
ogres are not like parfaits!
parfaits might be the most delicious
thing on the whole damn planet.
this may turn into the longest day
of my entire life.
- i got the perfect remedy for that!
- oh, no, i'm not interested.

- i am eternally in your debt.
- uh...
and where would a brave knight be
without his noble steed?
all right! hope you heard that.
she called me a "noble steed!"
she think i'm a steed.
well, sir shrek, the battle is won.
you may remove your helmet.
- uh... no.
-why not?
i... i have helmet hair.
please, i wouldest look
upon the face of my rescuer.
oh, no, you wouldn't-est.
but how will you kiss me?
what? that wasn't
in the job description.
maybe it's a perk.
no, it's destiny. "a princess
is rescued by a brave knight
and then they share
true love's first kiss."
with shrek? oh!
you think that shrek is your true love?
wah-wah!
- oh, no.
- what's so funny?
well, let's just say
i'm not your type, ok?
of course you are. you're my rescuer!
now remove your helmet.
look, i really don't think
that's a good idea.
- just take off the helmet.
- i'm not going to.
- take it off!
- no!
- now!
- ok! whoa. easy.
as you command,
your highness.
you're an ogre.
oh, you were expecting
prince charming?
well, yes, actually.
oh, no. i'm supposed to be rescued
by my true love.
- not by some ogre and his pet.
- oh...
- well, so much for "noble steed."
- you're not supposed to be an ogre.
princess, i was sent to rescue you
by lord farquaad, ok?
he's the one who
wants to marry you.
then why didn't he
come and rescue me?
good question. you should ask him that
when we get there tomorrow.
tomorrow?
- oh, my gosh, it's almost sunset!
- so?
oh, uh... i didn't realize
it was so late. we need to make camp.
camp?
but you've just escaped!
yes, and i found the whole ordeal
quite exhausting.
i need to rest immediately.
that's unfortunate,
because we're gonna keep going.
i need to find somewhere
to camp right now!
very well.
there's a cave right there.
- that is no place for a princess.
- no, it's perfect.
well, gentlemen,
i bid thee good night!
you want me to read you a bedtime story?
'cause i will.
i said good night!
she seems nice.
<i>"by day one way,
by night another,</i>
<i>this shall be the norm, until
you find true love's first kiss</i>
<i>and then take love's true form."</i>
and this is what i realized,
if we escaped a dragon,
man, we could do anything.
hey, i could be a steed.
ooh! or i could work
the crusades circuit if i wanted to.
i could even be one of those horses
that pulls those wagons full of beer!
i'd have to get some hair extensions
on my ankles, but i could do it.
- who do you wanna be?
- i don't want to be anyone.
just for fun, though,
who would you pick?
- i wouldn't. donkey...
- no, but if you had to.
like, if a guy had a sword
at your throat and he was like,
"look here, you can't be an ogre
anymore, pick something else,"
then who would you pick?
i would pick that guy up
and hurl him into a tree!
man, you are no fun at all,
you know it?
is this what it's gonna be like
when we finish rescuing the princess?
us sitting around our swamp
all day doing nothing?
our swamp? donkey, there is no "our."
there's no "we."
there's just me and my swamp.
and when i do get back,
the first thing i'm going to do is
build a ten-foot wall around my land.
you cut me deep, shrek.
you cut me real deep just now.
what's your problem anyway?
what you got against the whole world?
i'm not the one with
the problem, ok?
it's the world who seems
to have a problem with me.
you saw how that princess reacted.
that's how it always is.
people take one look at me and it's all,
"help! a big, stupid, ugly ogre!"
they judge me
before they even know me.
that's why i'm
better off alone.
but you know what, shrek?
when we met,
i didn't think you <i>was</i> just
a big, stupid, ugly ogre.
yeah, i know.

uh, princess,
did you by any chance eat
a few of those funny little
mushrooms by the stream?
of course not.
i'm just happy that it's a new day,
full of promise and fresh starts.
and the first thing
i would like to do
is to apologize
for my behavior yesterday.
we obviously got off on the wrong foot,
and i would like to make it up to you.
- you would?
- yes.
you did rescue me, after all.
so i've gathered a basket
of berries for the trip,
and i made you each...
oh, wow! look at these!
they're beautiful, princess!
- aren't they beautiful, shrek?
- oh... oh...
oh! you'll grow to love them,
i promise. lead the way!
so, uh...
so, princess,
do you often frolic with rats?
and what if i do?
oh, i don't know, princess,
germ-infested vermin,
not exactly what i expected.
well, maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you get to know them.
ouch!
so, tell me about my groom-to-be,
lord farquaad. what's he like?
well, um,
let me put it this way, princess,
men of farquaad's stature
are in short supply.
- really?
- yeah, but he is a little intimidating.
- well, he must be!
- and yet very good at small talk.
what are you guys doing?
what? just saying you might
want to lower your expectations a bit.
yes, like three feet or so.
all right, all right, yuck it up.
it doesn't bother me. not today.
after a lifetime of misery,
things are finally going my way.
oh...
a lifetime of misery, right. ok.
- you chuckled.
- huh?
when i said "lifetime of misery,"
you chuckled.
- did i?
- yes.
look, i'm sure it was very difficult
living in a dragon-guarded tower.
- it was.
- i'm sure.
all right, then.
although, it must've been nice
to have a roof and a cozy bed.
which is more
than i had when i left home.
you're not actually comparing yourself
to what i endured?
i'm just saying you don't corner
the market on unhappy childhoods.
there are things you
don't know, you know.
about me.
about how rough i had it!
what, you run out of
shampoo a couple of times?
- i mean about my life!

booked the cathedral and the band.

um, although i did wonder if you wanted
to maybe invite your father?
- my what?
- your father, my liege?
you mean that horrible little man who
tried to keep me down my whole life?
that mal-tempered monster?
that vile grunt who abandoned me
in the woods as a child?
well, he did have his reasons.
mirror, please.
my father simply couldn't accept
that i wanted nothing to do
with the family business.
that lowly, dirty family business.

s'nothers?
they're traditional ogre campfire

but instead of
marshmallow and chocolate,
we use squirrel gizzards and mulch.
they just melt in your mouth!
- i need to sit down for a minute.
- no, no sitting down.
- we need to get the princess to duloc.
- no, wait, shrek, i... um...
well, look, i may not get another chance
to try one of those s'nothers.
you eat one, you may not
get a chance to do anything!
- zip it, donkey.
- i was just thinking that maybe
duloc could wait
until morning?
- morning?
- why not?
i've spent my whole life without
true love. what's one more night?
- all right, i'll find us some dinner.
-  i'll get the firewood.
- oh, i'm so sorry.
- oh, my gosh, i'm so...

i guess i'll be dining
a little differently tomorrow night.
maybe you can come
visit me in the swamp sometime.
i'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.
swamp toad soup, fish eye tartar.
you name it.
i'd like that.
shrek, i know you
can't hear me right now.
but if you could,
i'd want to say a few things to you.
i'm in your corner, buddy.
but you have got to tell this girl
what you're really feeling deep down.
you may not get another chance.
so just go on now.
just open your heart and...

- what?
wait a minute.
i see what's going on here.
you're afraid of the
dark, aren't you?
yes, that's it. i'm terrified.
you know what? i'd better go inside.
don't worry, i used to be
afraid of the dark, too, until...
oh! no, wait.
i'm still afraid of the dark!
- i'm so sorry, i have to go.
- oh. all right.
- good night.
- good night.
uh-uh.
no, sir. i'm sorry,
but i did not come this whole way,
putting up with you
and your body odor,
just so you can let her
walk away like that!
- what are you talking about?
- i'm an animal, and i got instincts.
and you two were obviously
digging on each other.
oh, you're crazy.
i'm just bringing her back to farquaad.
so you don't have
any feelings for her at all?
look, even if i did and
i'm not saying i do, because i don't.
she's a princess and i'm...
- an ogre?
- yeah.
- an ogre.
- she needs to know.
- hey, where you going?
- to get more wood,
before your fire dies.
princess.
princess fiona.
princess, where are you?
princess, it's very spooky in here,
i ain't playing no games... oh!
- no! help! shrek!
- oh, no, no, no! it's ok!
- what'd you do with the princess?
- donkey, i am the princess. it's me.
- in this body.
- oh, my god. you ate the princess!
can you hear me? keep breathing!
i'll get you out of there!
donkey!
princess?
what happened to you?
"by day one way,
by night another,
this shall be the norm, until
you find true love's first kiss
and then take love's true form."
that's beautiful.
i didn't know you wrote poetry.
donkey, it's a curse.
i've had it since i was girl.
- a curse?
- a witch cast a spell on me.
now every night, when the sun
goes down i become this...
...this horrible,
ugly beast!
all right, calm down,
you're not that ugly.
ok, i'm not gonna lie,
you are ugly,
but you only look like this at night.
shrek's ugly 24/7.
- wait a second, that's perfect!
- perfect? donkey,
if lord farquaad finds out i look
like this, he'll never marry me!
- so?
- so, i have to kiss my true love!
the kiss is the only thing that will
break the spell and make me beautiful.
but, you know,
you're kind of an ogre, and shrek...
well, you got a lot in common.
- shrek?
- yeah, if he knew all this,
- i think maybe...
- no, wait, wait, wait, he can't know.
and you can't tell him! not a word!
no one must ever know!
- promise you won't tell. promise!
- all right, all right.
i won't tell him.
but you should.
man, i know when
this is all over,
i'm gonna need a whole lot
of serious therapy.
princess, i...
how's it going first of all?
good?
good for me, too. i'm ok.

donkey?
what are you doing?
oh, i would think you of all people
would recognize a wall when you saw one!
well, yeah. but the wall is supposed
to go around my swamp, not through it.
it is around your half. see?
that's your half, this is my half.
- your half?
- yes, my half.
i helped rescue the princess, i did
half the work, i get half the booty.
- back off.
- no, you back off.
- stubborn jackass!
- smelly ogre!
this is my swamp!
there you go, "my, my, my!
me, me, me!" well, guess what?
now it's my turn, so you just shut up
and pay attention.
you are mean to me.
you insult me and you do not
appreciate anything i do.
you're always pushing me around
or pushing me away!
you're so wrapped up in layers, onion
boy, you're afraid of your own feelings!
well, if i treated you so badly,
why did you come back?
because that's what friends do,
they forgive each other!
go away!
there you are doing it again!
just like you did to fiona!
all she ever did was like you.
maybe even love you!
love me?
she said i was ugly!
a hideous creature!
i heard the two of you talking!
she wasn't talking about you!
she was talking about hersel...
...someone else.
she wasn't talking about me?
well then, who was she talking about?
no, sir. i ain't saying nothing.
you don't wanna listen to me, right?
right?
- donkey!
- no.
ok, look, i'm sorry, all right?
i'm sorry.
i guess i am just
a big, stupid, ugly ogre.
can you forgive me?
hey, that's what friends are for,
right?
right.
- friends?
- oh! friends!
so, what did fiona
say about me?
what are you asking me for?
why don't you just go ask her?
donkey!
the wedding!
- we'll never make it in time!
- i know someone who can help!
people of duloc,
we gather here today to bear witness
to the union of our
new king and queen.
and as the warm glow
of this setting sun lifts our heads,
so too does the...
excuse me.
could we just skip to the "i do's"?
- what?
- uh, yeah. go on, go on.
right, well then, do you, lord farquaad,
take princess fiona?
- i do.
- and do you...
- i do.
- yes, i thought you might.
well, then,
by the power vested in me...
- stop the wedding!
- shrek?
what does he want?
really, it's rude enough
being alive when no one wants you,
but showing up uninvited to a wedding?
- fiona, i need to talk to you.
- oh, now you want to talk?
well, it's a little late for that,
so if you'll excuse me...
- but you can't marry him!
- and why not?
because he's just marrying you
so he can be king.
that is outrageous!
- fiona, don't listen to him.
- he's not your true love.
and what do you know
about true love?
well... i...
um...
oh... oh...
aw...
well, this is precious. huh? hm?
the ogre has fallen in love
with the princess. oh, good lord.
mm! guards, take this abomination
out of my sight!
no!
i mean...
let's hear what the monster has to say.
it might be worth a laugh.
oh, you are awful.
well, you heard her, ogre.
express yourself. hm?
with as few grunts as possible.
right. ok.
um...
