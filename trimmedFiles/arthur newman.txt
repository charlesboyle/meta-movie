spur of the moment decision.
you see, i was thinking what
is the most economical
vacation that i--
that we could take--
-on my limited budget and, well,
it dawned on me i used
to be a boy scout leader,
and i had a tent, and a
sleeping bad, and--
well, actually, i didn't think
you'd want to come, what with
the sand, sea creatures, and--
like i said, it was more
or less a spur
of the moment decision.

dog, wallace.
i got to go back to work.

[knock on door]
-i can't sleep in my room.
[tv  in background]

-by the way, that was very
kind of you, mike.
[music playing]
[music playing]
-same guy.
wallace avery.
[music playing]
[music playing]
[jukebox music]
-how's life treatin' you?
-keep the change.
-who are you?
i mean, really?
-i guess i've always
been arthur newman.
wife just forced another
individual on me.
-wallace avery was
such a nothing?
-actually, mike, wallace avery
was manager of a large,
multinational corporation.
-what, like blackwater
or evil empire--
-no, federal express.
-well, i ran a branch
in orlando.
well, i was floor manager.
-oh, jesus!
no wonder you want to
be arthur newman.
why the gold angle?
i just happen to be a
very good golfer.
last spring at diamondback
golf club, i observed a
gentleman taking
practice shots.
he had some serious issues with
his swing, and i offered
him some, quite frankly,
valuable advise.
and the next thing i know, this
gentleman grabs me on the
"sir, you are a godsend.
i'm shooting like my old self
again." and he tells me he
owns a private golf club in
terre haute, indiana, and i am
welcome there any time.
-well, that moment, mike,
i had an epiphany.
"sir," i said, "my name is
arthur newman." it just popped
"and i have recently returned
stateside after 15 years
abroad on asian tours," and
did he need a teaching
pro, i asked him.
he shook my hand, and
he said, "arthur,
consider yourself hired.
i'll see you in terre
haute next summer."
-so you just ditched wallace
avery for a total stranger's
half-baked promise?
-how very good are you?
-see that tractor?
i'm going to hit it.
bystander (offscreen): huh!
cool!
[applause]
-see the truck?
-oh!
[applause]
[mike cheering]
[music playing]
[music playing]
avery (voiceover): can i ask
you a personal question?
mike (voiceover): i don't
know, can you?
[knock on door]
avery (voiceover): where you
going to go after we get to
terre haute?
mike (voiceover): i don't know.
i guess--
avery(voiceover): don't
you have a place?
you know, a--
mike (voiceover): a,
i a home owner?
avery(voiceover): don't you
have, you know, a family?
-no, not really.
-no dad?
-no.
-mom?
-killed herself.
-i'm so sorry.
[mike coughs]
-you have siblings?
-i have a twin sister in
a loony bin, arthur.
i put her there for the fourth
time right before i met you.
so you see, i really don't
have that much family.
-twin sister?
as an identical twin sister?
-good night, arthur.
-by any chance, does your twin
sister have short, blond hair?
lives in durham, and you're
carrying her driver's license?
-you really think you're the
only person walking around
with someone else's id?
-how is this possible?
-i mean, you both--
we're both--
is this why you agreed
to come with me?
-look, don't think this makes
us any closer, ok?
-so--
who are you?
what's your name?
[crying]
-(quietly) hey--
so sorry.
my questions upset you, mike?
-my name is charlotte.
-kevin, over here!
watch me!
over here!
watch me!
[laughter]
-fuck off, jamie!
-nice trip, dumb ass!
there's someone here who'd like
to speak with you about
your father.
this is mina crawley.
she is a friend of wallace's.
i'm a dear, dear friend
of your dad's.
he-- he spoke so
much about you.
it's a genuine pleasure to--
you do resemble him here.
-your father went camping
five days ago
and he hasn't returned.
-at talbot state park at, um--
at the ocean.
the atlantic ocean.
-the police are searching for
him, but so far, they have
found nothing, and they've--
crawley they're very
concerned.
yeah, well, nice to
meet you, i guess.
-hey, charlotte!
charlotte!
-why are you standing in the
middle of the street, arthur?
i thought you'd--
-look
[horn honking]
-[gasping]

let's follow them!
[music playing]
[music playing]
-why don't we just return the
veil and get out of here?
-oh, they're leaving.
let's just give it to them.
-no, no, no.
wait, wait.
[gasps]
they're going on their
honeymoon, arthur!
oh, that's very exciting.
i'm not sure "exciting"
is the--
-shhh.
[rooster crowing]
-mike.
mike, i don't like this.
-mike, what we're doing
is returning the veil.
why don't you just--
just leave it on the porch?
-shh!
-mike?
-mike, just set it on the
kitchen table and-- and get
out of there.

-mike, what are you doing?

-come 'ere, gene.
lie down beside me.
-mike, cut it out, really.
it's-- it's wrong.
-wrong?
is love wrong on our
weddin' day?
-it's not what i--
what i mean is, is pretending
to be--
-we deserve to be
happy, eugene.
-i'm not eugene and
you're not--
-i know.
(whispering) let me be
your joy, eugene.
take my love, all of it.
you'll be my happiness, too.

[music playing]
[music playing]
-can i be myself, please?
-oh, what the hell?

life size picture of you.

the night sky.
[music playing]
[music playing]

him i grew up?
-oh, my goodness.
uh--

-live with me.
you can be michaela.
i can be arthur.
we can both have the
lives we want.
finally.
what do you say?
the water pressure
here is superb.
-my mom was a paranoid
schizophrenic, arthur.
and so was my sister.
you can't understand
how scary that is.
how can i live with anyone?
i'm a genetic time bomb.
[duck quacking]
-i hear that duck quack,
and i know it's a duck.
but sooner or later, it's going
to be ducks sending me
secret messages, telling me--
-when will it be over?
when will i stop being me?
-who says you will?
-statistics.
someone with my family
history--
-you're not a statistic, mike.
you're a person who can't defend
herself against her
worst feelings.
you feel the things most of us
run away from, the things most
of us are just too bottled
up to feel.
-[inaudible]
-now do i have to have
sex with you?
because i really
don't want to.
-it's all right, it's ok.
[music playing]
[music playing]
-i can't get these sons
of bitches out.
will you help me, arthur?
use the brush.
-no, the brush will hurt you.
i need to use my hands.
-ok, go ahead.
just be--
-careful, i know.
-did you have any
kids, arthur?
i mean, did wallace have kids?
-no, none.

-come on, you can go now.
what's the matter?
-i just feel a little dizzy.
i just--
i think i need--
-you need a hot dog.
man (offscreen): a pirate goes
into the bar, and the
bartender says, "hey, buddy,
you got a steering wheel in
-and the pirate says, "aye.
driving me nuts." [laughter]
-did you ever win a trophy
like that, arthur?
how many?
like a few?
a lot?
a lot, a lot, or just a lot.
-a lot, a lot, i guess.
-how come such a hot
shot had to end up
working at a fedex, then?
arthur?
he's choking!
he's choking!
arthur?
he's choking!
he's choking!
first announcer (offscreen):
another rough
day for wallace avery.
he was an outstanding amateur

handle the big time.
right on cue.
man (offscreen): nice
job, larry!

pull this off, mike.
-pull what off?

-times you did that.
-[inaudible]
[laughter]
[talking in background]
[clock ticking]
-ludmilla!
[laughter]
-no.
-no!
-golf.
it's a mental game, a
mental component.
that was lacking.
serious choking problem.
-sorry to hear he's
dead, though.
-yeah, really sorry.
announcer (offscreen): you can
almost see avery's mind hijack
his instincts.
it's hard to watch a guy get in
his own way over and over
again like this.
just a mental train wreck.
welcome to terre haute
country club.
-thank you.
[classical music playing]
-hello there, april.
we're looking for the owner,
chuck willoughby.
-unfortunately, mr. willoughby
has gone home for tonight, but

we'll be back in the morning.
-do you want a dirty martini
with two olives?
-i'll have a martini
with four olives.

teach you to do for me, mike.
golf.
-[laughs]
-this--
this is a putter.
-oh!
-it's for--
putting.
[mike laughing]
-now the most important thing
is a light touch, extremely
light touch on the club, like
you're holding a bird in the
palm of your hand.
-your were--
i mean, wallace avery--
were married, weren't you?
now, just tuck-- tuck your
fingers together like so.
-what was she like, the wife?
-there you go.
good job!
-she a golfer?
did you teach her how to tuck
her fingers in, too?
-bend your knees a little.
-bend your knees.
keep some spring in them.
-did you love her
a lot, arthur?
-why no kids, huh?
is there something
wrong with you?
-will you stick to the
matter in hand?
-what's the big deal?
i told you all about the
insanity in my family, so
what's a little infertility?
-there's nothing wrong
with me, mike.
maybe you have extremely
weak sperm.
-my sperm's fine, thank you.
-you should probably
get it tested.
-i think wallace avery is in
serious denial about his--
-i have a son.
all right?
there's nothing wrong with me.
-arthur, i--
big whoop, you have a son.
why is that such a big secret?
-arthur?
uh--
-chuck.
diamond back.
yes, it's actually me,
arthur newman.
we were told you went home.
we were getting soused at
a bar down the road.

your wonderful bar.
by the way, this is michaela
fitzgerald.
-whore.
[laughing]
-hi.

you about, gary?
the pro?
diamond back?
i'm going to hire him,
work here, remember?
-well, anyway, we're all systems

him and find out there's no such
fucking pro ever worked
the asian circuits called
arthur newman.
and here he is.
with a whore.
[laughing]
-fuckin' beautiful!
what am i going to do, gary?
what am i going to do
with this liar?
call the police?
[laughing]
[laughing]
-i don't feel like talking
right now, mike.
-what are you watching?
-the history channel.
do you want to sit down?
-sure.
-i read that how you rate your
life questionnaire my dad
filled out.
-you did?
-yeah.
you know, he didn't-- he didn't
rate you very high.
-yeah, i know.
but you got a 10.
guess that makes you happy.
-he's full of shit.
you know that, right?
i mean, when i needed
him, i got zero.
and now that i don't give
a shit, i'm a 10?
i mean, fuck him.
[music playing]
[music playing]
-kevin his name's kevin.
he's 13.
he was 6 when my wife left me.
she said i spend more time
with the cat than
i did with my kid.
golf was the excuse.
-if i'm honest, the reason
i stayed away was--
you hear about that overpowering
rush of love a
parent feels for their kid?
well, for me, it was--
-you don't have to
do this, arthur.
i really don't need to know.
-drip, drip, drip.
i couldn't feel the big ones.
the stuff that runs,
i couldn't--
so when you ask is there
something wrong with me, yeah.
-that was then.
arthur, look at you now.
-do you miss michaela?
-no.
-think she misses you?
-no.
-who takes care of her?
-nurses and doctors,
professionals, whatever.
-i mean, who takes
care of her when
she's not in the hospital?
-she's a grown woman.
she can take care of herself.
-so it's obviously not you.
-me?
how am i supposed to take
care of a lunatic?
look at me.
practically certifiable
myself.
just look at me.
-i'm looking at your back.
-it's just an act, isn't it?
to avoid responsibility?
for yourself, for your sister.
for all the selfish
things you do.
-shut the fuck up.
tv (offscreen): the elusive
species that i hope to get was
the oceanic white tip, which is
