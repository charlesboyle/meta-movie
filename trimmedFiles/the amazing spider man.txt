how would a predator
track a reptile?
oh, they don't.
most reptiles are at the top
of their food chain.
kings of their domain.
they gotta have vulnerabilities.
why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?
just asking a question.
i got school stuff.
biology profiles to do.
mm.
so because of the cold blood,
would they react to changes

you'd have to catch one first.

i'm telling you the absolute truth.
this man has worked for his whole

he lost an arm, he tried to grow it
back, but the equation was imbalanced.
he has turned into a lizard.
he's using lizard dna.
he is dangerous, and he is planning
