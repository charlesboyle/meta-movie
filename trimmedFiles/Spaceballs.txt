(breathlng heavlly)
(choklng)
l can't breathe

we're approaching
planet druidia, sir.

l'll call spaceball city and
notify president skroob immediately.

(groanlng)
(sobblng)

there it is.
planet druidia.
and underneath the air shield,
we must get through
that air shield.
we will, sir.
once we kidnap the princess, we
can force her father, king roland,
to give us the combination
to the air shield,
thereby destroying planet druidia
and saving planet spaceball.
everybody got that?
good. when will the
princess be married?
within the hour, sir.
well, l hope
it's a long ceremony,
'cause it's gonna be
a short honeymoon.

take orders, l give them.
this is my dreamboat,
sweetheart.
sweetheart?
oh-oh.
how dare you
speak to me that way?
you will address me in the proper
manner as your royal highness.
l am princess vespa,
daughter of roland,
king of the druids.
that's all we needed.
a druish princess.
funny.
she doesn't look druish.
now we will show her who
is in charge of this galaxy.
hold it. l'll handle
this personally.
jawohl,
lord helmet!
so, princess vespa,
you thought you could outwit the
imperious forces of planet spaceball.
well, you were wrong.
you are now our prisoner.
and you will be held
hostage until such time
as all of the air is
transferred from your planet
to ours.
she's not in there.

uh-oh.
that's it.
you and
your dog are. . .
please.
total humans,
droids, if l may?
lt's going to be
very dark soon.
l suggest we find a place
to camp for the night.
come, darling.
lone starr:
see? lt's lighter.
oh, yeah.
this is the best.
l could have carried
two or three of these.
have you
found them yet?
no, lord helmet.
they're still not
on the scanner.
well, keep looking
for them.
(slurplng)
pardon me, sir.
l have an idea.
corporal, get me the video
cassette of spaceballs: the movie.
corporal: yes, sir.
"the producers, twelve chairs,
blazing saddles, young frankenstein."
colonel sandurz, may l
speak with you, please?
yes, sir.
how can there be a cassette
of spaceballs: the movie?
we're still in the
middle of making it.
true, sir.
there's been a new breakthrough
in home video marketing.
there has?
yes.
lnstant cassettes.
they're out in stores
before the movie is finished.
no.
here it is, sir!
spaceballs.
sandurz: good work,

(chatterlng squeaklly)
(exploslon)
no, go past this.
past this part.
ln fact, never play

try here. stop.
what the hell
am l looking at?
when does this happen
in the movie?
now.
you're looking
at now, sir.
everything that happens now
is happening now.
what happened to then?
we passed then.
when?
just now.
we're at now, now.
go back to then.
when?
now.
l can't. we missed it.
when?
just now.
when will then
be now?
soon.
how soon?
corporal: sir! we've
identified their location !
where?
lt's the moon of vega.
set a course and
prepare for our arrival.
when?
by high noon tomorrow,
they will be our prisoners.
who?
(crlckets chlrplng)
no, thank you.
l'm perfectly all right.
take it,
it's freezing.
lf you insist.
won't you be cold?
no, cold never bothers me.
(slghs)
l can't seem
to find druidia.
lt's right there.
where?
lt's right there. lt's that
bright blue one right there. see?
oh, yeah.
but it's so far away.
don't worry,
l'll get you there.
which one's yours?
who knows?
you don't know
where you're from?
not really. l was found on
the doorstep of a monastery.
monastery? where?
somewhere
in the ford galaxy.
well, didn't the monks tell
you who your parents were?
they couldn't. they
took a vow of silence.
all l got was this.
lt was around my neck.
what is it?
l don't know.
l've taken it to every
wise man in the universe
and nobody could
tell me what it means.
lt's beautiful.
you know, l. . .
lt's beautiful.
so, how come you ran
away from your wedding?
well, if you must know, l
wasn't in love with the groom.
why were you
going to marry him?
because l'm a princess, and
l have to marry a prince.
and he doesn't
do it for you, huh?
no, he doesn't
do it for me.
(slghs)
l really must go back.
l shouldn't have run away.
l realize now that
love is one luxury
you're probably right.
l know now that l must
learn to live without love.
l guess so.
besides, love isn't
that important.
no, it never was.
l could be perfectly happy
the rest of my life without
love.
sure you could.
without physical contact.
yeah.
without being held.
yeah.
or kissed.
(alarm blarlng)
abandon ship!
women and mawgs first!
(blarlng stops) we'll

that was
my virgin alarm.
lt's programmed to
go off before you do.
you get back
to bed, miss.
and as for you,
sex fiend. . .
all right. let's all
just get some sleep.
we gotta get moving

nothing yet, sir.
dark helmet:
how about you?
not a thing, sir.
