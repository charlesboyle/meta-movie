give me the child.
through dangers untold
and hardships unnumbered...
...i have fought my way to the castle
beyond the goblin city...
...to take back the child
that you have stolen.
for my will
is as strong as yours...
...and my kingdom is as great.
for my will is as strong as yours,
my kingdom as great.
damn.
i can never remember that line.
"you have no power over me."
oh, merlin.
oh, no, merlin.
i don't believe it. it's 7:00!
come on. come on!
it's not fair!
oh, really.
- i'm sorry.
- don't stand in the rain. come on.
all right. come on, merlin.
- come on.
- not the dog.
- but it's pouring.
- go on, into the garage.
go on, merlin.
go into the garage.
go.
- sarah, you're an hour late.
- i said i'm sorry!
please let me finish.
- your father and i go out rarely.
- you go out every single weekend.
i ask you to babysit only if it
won't interfere with your plans.
you don't know what my plans are.
you don't even ask me anymore.
i assume you'd tell me you had a date.
i'd like it if you had a date.
- you should have dates at your age.
- sarah, you're home.
- we were worried about you.
- i can't do anything right, can i?
she treats me like a wicked stepmother
in a fairy story no matter what i say.
i'll talk to her.
through dangers untold...
...and hardships unnumbered...
...i have fought my way here
to the castle...
...beyond the goblin city...
...to take back the child...
...that you have stolen.
- sarah? can i talk to you?
- there's nothing to talk about!
hurry. you're gonna be late.
listen, we fed toby
and put him to bed.
we do have to leave now,
but we'll be back around midnight.
you really wanted
to talk to me, didn't you?
practically broke down the door.
lancelot!
someone has been in my room again.
i hate that. i hate it!
i hate you. i hate you!
someone save me, take me away
from this awful place!
what do you want?
you want a story, huh?
okay.
once upon a time
there was a beautiful, young girl...
...whose stepmother always
made her stay home with the baby.
the baby was a spoiled child
and wanted everything for himself...
...and the young girl
was practically a slave.
but what no one knew...
...was that the king of the goblins
had fallen in love with the girl...
...and he had given her
certain powers.
so one night...
...when the baby had been
particularly cruel to her...
...she called on the goblins for help.
listen.
"say your right words,"
the goblins said.
"and we'll take the baby
to the goblin city...
...and you will be free."
but the girl knew
that the king of the goblins...
...would keep the baby in his castle
forever and ever and ever...
...and turn it into a goblin.
so the girl suffered in silence...
...until one night, when she was tired
from a day of housework...
...and she was hurt by the harsh words
of her stepmother...
...and she could no longer
stand it...
all right! all right!
knock it off. come on.
stop it! stop it!
i'll say the words.
no, i mustn't. i mustn't say.
i wish... i wish...
- is she going to say it?
- say what?
- shut up.
- sorry.
you shut up.
listen.
she's going to say the words.
i can bear it no longer!
goblin king, goblin king,
wherever you may be...
...take this child of mine
far away from me!
that's not it.
where'd she learn that rubbish?
it doesn't even start with, "i wish."
toby, stop it!
i wish i did know what to say
to make the goblins take you away.
"i wish the goblins would come
and take you away right now."
that's not hard, is it?
i wish...
- did she say it?
- shut up!
i wish the goblins would come
and take you away.
right now.
toby?
toby, are you all right?
why aren't you crying?
you're him, aren't you?
you're the goblin king.
i want my brother back, please,
if it's all the same.
what's said is said.
but i didn't mean it.
- you didn't?
- please.
where is he?
you know very well where he is.
please bring him back. please.
sarah...
...go back to your room...
...play with your toys
and your costumes.
forget about the baby.
i can't.
i've brought you a gift.
- what is it?
- it's a crystal...
...nothing more.
but if you turn it this way...
...look into it...
...it'll show you your dreams.
but this is not a gift
for an ordinary girl...
...who takes care
of a screaming baby.
do you want it?
then forget the baby.
i can't.
i appreciate what you're trying to do
for me, but i want my brother back.
- he must be so scared.
- sarah.
don't defy me.
you're no match for me.
but i have to
have my brother back.
he's there, in my castle.
do you still
want to look for him?
is that the castle
beyond the goblin city?
turn back, sarah.
turn back before it's too late.
i can't.
don't you understand
that i can't?
what a pity.
it doesn't look that far.
it's further than you think.
time is short.
you have 13 hours in which
to solve the labyrinth...
...before your baby brother...
...becomes one of us...
...forever.
such a pity.
the labyrinth.
it doesn't look that hard.
well, come on, feet.
- excuse me?
- excuse me!
it's you.
excuse me, but i have to get through
this labyrinth. can you help me?
how sweet.
fifty-seven!
- how could you?
- yeah.
poor thing.
you monster.
it bit me!
what did you expect
fairies to do?
i thought they did nice things,
like granting wishes.
shows what you know,
don't it?
- fifty-eight.
- you're horrible.
huh? no, i ain't.
i'm hoggle. who are you?
- sarah.
- that's what i thought.
fifty-nine.
do you know where the door
to the labyrinth is?
- maybe.
- where is it?
you little...
sixty!
- i said, where is it?
- where is what?
- the door.
- what door?
- it's hopeless asking you anything.
- not if you ask the right questions.
how do i get into the labyrinth?
now that's more like it.
you gets in there.
you really going in there,
are you?
yes.
i'm afraid i have to.
cosy, isn't it?
now, would you go left
or right?
- they both look the same.
- well, you're not gonna get very far.
- which way would you go?
- me?
i wouldn't go either way.
if that's all the help you're
gonna be, you can just leave.
you know your problem?
you take too many things for granted.
take this labyrinth...
...even if you get to the centre,
you'll never get out again.
- that's your opinion.
- it's a lot better than yours.
thanks for nothing, hogwart.
it's hoggle!
and don't say i didn't warn you.
what do they mean, "labyrinth"?
there aren't any turns or corners.
it just goes on and on.
maybe it doesn't.
maybe i'm just taking it
for granted that it does.
'allo.
did you say "hello"?
no, i said, "'allo,"
but that's close enough.
- you're a worm, aren't you?
- yeah, that's right.
you don't by any chance
know the way through this labyrinth?
who, me?
no, i'm just a worm.
come inside, meet the missus.
no, thank you, but i have
to solve this labyrinth.
but there aren't any turns
or any openings or anything.
it just goes on and on.
you ain't looking right. it's full
of openings, but you ain't seeing them.
- where are they?
- there's one just across there.
it's right in front of you.
no, there isn't.
come inside and have
a nice cup of tea.
- but there isn't an opening.
- of course there is.
you try walking through it.
you'll see what i mean.
- what?
- go on then.
that's just wall.
there's no way through.
things are not always
what they seem in this place.
so you can't take anything
for granted.
hey!
- hang on.
- thank you.
- that was incredibly helpful.
- don't go that way.
- what was that?
- i said don't go that way.
never go that way.
thanks.
if she had kept on
going down that way...
...she'd had gone straight
to that castle.
toby.
i'm coming, toby.
give me back this!
go on, get off me.
stay out of the way.
what are you talking about?
walk, walk, walk.
- you remind me of the babe.
- what babe?
- the babe with the power.
- what power?
- the power of voodoo.
- who do?
- you do.
- do what?
remind me of the babe.
quiet! a goblin babe.
well?
hey, what goes on?
your mother is an aardvark!
in nine hours and 23 minutes...
...you'll be mine.
- you got it?
- i got it.
good.
oh, no.
someone has been
changing my marks.
what a horrible place this is.
it's not fair!
that's right. it's not fair.
but that's only half of it.
- this was a dead end a minute ago.
- no, that's the dead end behind you.
it keeps changing.
what am i supposed to do?
the only way out of here
is to try one of these doors.
one of them leads to the castle
at the centre of the labyrinth.
and the other one leads to...
...certain death.
which one is which?
- we can't tell you.
- why not?
- we don't know.
- but they do.
then i'll ask them.
no, you can't ask us.
you can only ask one of us.
it's in the rules.
and i should warn you...
...one of us always tells the truth,
and one of us always lies.
that's a rule too.
he always lies.
- i do not. i tell the truth.
- what a lie.
he's the liar.
all right. answer yes or no.
would he tell me that this door
leads to the castle?
- what do you think?
- i don't know.
yes.
then the other door leads
to the castle...
...and this door leads
to certain death.
how do you know?
he could be telling the truth.
but then you wouldn't be.
so if you told me that he said yes,
i know the answer is no.
- but i could be telling the truth.
- but then he would be lying.
so if you told me that he said yes,
i know the answer would still be no.
wait a minute. is that right?
i don't know.
i've never understood it.
no, it's right.
i've figured it out.
i could never do it before.
i think i'm getting smarter.
this is a piece of cake.
help!
stop it! help!
what do you mean, "help"?
we are helping.
we're helping hands.
you're hurting.
would you like us to let go?
no!
well then, come on,
which way?
which way?
up or down?
come on, come on.
we haven't got all day.
well, it's a big decision for her.
which way do you want to go?
yes, which way?
well, since i'm pointed that way,
i guess i'll go down.
she chose down.
she chose down?
- was that wrong?
- too late now.
she's in the oubliette.
shut up! she should not have gotten
as far as the oubliette.
- she should have given up by now.
- she'll never give up.
won't she? the dwarf's about
to lead her back to the beginning.
she'll soon give up when she realises
she has to start all over again.
well, laugh.
who's there?
me.
- it's you.
- yes, well...
...i knew you were gonna get into
trouble as soon as i met you.
so i've come to give you a hand.
you're looking around now,
aren't you?
i suppose you noticed
there ain't no doors.
only the hole.
this is an oubliette.
the labyrinth's full of them.
- really? how do you know that?
- don't sound so smart.
- you don't know what an oubliette is.
- do you?
yes, it's a place you put people
to forget about them.
now, what you've gotta do
is get out of here.
and it so happens
that i know a shortcut...
...out of the whole labyrinth
from here.
no, i'm not giving up now.
i've come too far.
- no, i'm doing okay.
- of course you are.
but it gets a lot worse
from here on in.
why are you so concerned about me?
well, i am, that's all.
nice, young girl.
terrible, black oubliette.
you like jewellery, don't you?
why?
if you help me solve the labyrinth,
i'll give you this.
you like it, don't you?
so-so.
okay.
tell you what...
...give me the bracelet and i'll
show you the way out of the labyrinth.
- you were gonna do that anyway.
- yes, well...
...that would make it a
particularly nice gesture on your part.
no. i'll tell you what...
...if you won't take me to the centre,
take me as far as you can.
- then i'll do it on my own.
- what is that anyway?
plastic.
i don't promise nothing, but...
...l'll take you as far as i can.
then you're on your own, right?
- right.
- right.
plastic!
here we go.
damn.
broom closet.
well, can't be right
all the time.
this is it. come on then.
- this way.
- don't go on.
go back while you still can.
this is not the way.
take heed and go no further.
beware. beware.
soon it will be too late.
don't pay any attention
to them.
they're just false alarms.
you get a lot of them in the labyrinth.
especially when you're
on the right track.
- oh, no, you're not.
- shut up.
- sorry. just doing my job.
- you don't have to do it to us.
- beware for...
- just forget it.
please, i haven't said it
for such a long time.
all right, but don't
expect a big reaction.
no, no, no, of course not.
for the path you will take
will lead to certain destruction.
thank you very much.
oh, no.
what have we here?
- nothing.
- nothing?
nothing? nothing?
nothing, tra-la-la?
your majesty,
what a nice surprise.
- hello, hedgewart.
- hogwart.
hoggle!
hoggle, can it be
that you're helping this girl?
helping? in what sense?
in the sense that you're
leading her towards the castle.
no, i was taking her back
to the beginning, your majesty.
what?
i told her i was gonna help her
solve the labyrinth...
...a little trickery on my part,
but actually...
what is that plastic thing
round your wrist?
oh, this?
my goodness,
where did this come from?
- higgle...
- hoggle.
if i thought for one second
that you were betraying me...
...l'd be forced to suspend you
headfirst in the bog of eternal stench.
no, your majesty!
not the eternal stench!
yes, hoggle!
and you, sarah.
how are you enjoying
my labyrinth?
it's a piece of cake.
really? then how about
upping the stakes.
that's not fair!
you say that so often.
i wonder what your basis
for comparison is.
so the labyrinth's
a piece of cake, is it?
well, let's see how you deal
with this little slice.
no, the cleaners!
- what?
- run!
you okay?
come on!
faster!
oh, no.
the cleaners!
the bog of stench!
you sure got his attention.
this is what we need...
...a ladder. follow me.
how can i trust you now that i know you
were taking me back to the beginning?
i wasn't.
i told him i was taking you back to the
beginning to throw him off the scent.
hoggle, how can i believe
anything you say?
well, let me put it this way.
what choice have you got?
you're right.
you see, you've gotta
understand my position.
i'm a coward,
and jareth scares me.
- what kind of position is that?
- no position. that's my point.
you wouldn't be so brave
if you'd ever smelled...
...the bog of eternal stench.
it's... it's...
is that all it does, is smell?
believe me, that's enough.
but the worst thing is,
if you so much...
...as put a foot
in the bog of stench...
...you'll smell bad
for the rest of your life.
it'll never wash off.
here we are then.
you're on your own from now on.
- what?
- that's it. i quit.
wait a minute. hoggle!
i didn't promise nothing. i said
i'd take you as far as i could go.
you little cheat.
you nasty, little cheat.
don't try to embarrass me.
i've got no pride.
oh, yeah?
but them's my jewels!
you give them back!
give them back. give those back.
give those back to me!
now, there's the castle.
which way should we try?
them's my rightful property.
it's not fair!
no, it isn't.
but that's the way it is.
excuse me, please,
but can you help me?
a young girl!
and who is this?
- my friend.
- well, yes.
and what can i do for you?
please, can you tell...?
that is...
i have to get to the castle
at the centre. do you know the way?
well, yes, now.
you want to get to the castle.
how's that for brainpower, huh?
be quiet!
ah, nuts.
so, young woman...
...the way forward
is sometimes the way back.
will you listen to this crap?
- will you please be quiet?!
- sorry. all right.
- okay?
- okay!
- all right.
- all right!
- what?
- sorry.
finished?
yes.
quite often, young lady...
...it seems like we're not getting
anywhere, when in fact...
- we are.
- we are.
i'm certainly not getting
anywhere at the moment.
join the club.
i think that's your lot.
please leave a contribution
in the little box.
don't you dare! them's mine.
well, i guess i can spare this.
you didn't
have to give him that.
he didn't tell you nothing.
well then,
there go a couple of suckers.
it's so stimulating
being your hat.
why did you say that...
...about my being your friend?
because you are.
you may not be much of a friend...
...but you're the only one i've got
in this place.
do you hear something?
- no, it's all right.
- friend.
i like that.
i ain't never been
no one's friend before.
- goodbye!
- wait a minute.
- keep the stuff.
- are you my friend or not?
no, i'm not.
hoggle ain't no one's friend.
he looks after himself,
like everyone.
hoggle is hoggle's friend.
hoggle, you coward!
well, i'm not afraid.
things aren't always
what they seem in this place.
try on this for size,
you big yeti!
we've got you now,
fuzzball!
all together now.
if only i had something to throw.
sock it to him!
sock it to him!
what happened? who turned out
the light? i can't see!
- why'd you bite me?
- who bite who?
who bite me? who bite me?
- i can't see!
- what is going on?
retreat!
who bit me?
my aching sushi!
now, stop that.
is that any way to treat someone
who's trying to help you?
don't you want me
to help you down?
ludo down.
ludo?
is that your name?
ludo.
you seem like such a nice beast.
well, i certainly hope you
are what you seem to be.
just hang on.
i'll get you down.
just a second.
i'm sorry!
ludo, are you hurt?
ludo?
friend?
that's right, ludo.
i'm sarah.
sarah.
here, let me help you.
are you okay?
sarah. sarah friend.
now, wait. just a second.
- i want to ask you something, ludo.
- what?
i have to get to the castle
at the labyrinth's centre.
do you know the way?
- no.
- you don't know either, huh?
i wonder if anyone knows how
to get through this labyrinth.
get through the labyrinth.
get through the labyrinth.
one thing for sure. she'll never
get through the labyrinth.
hey.
where did they come from?
what do you think?
which shall we choose
out of these two ugly characters?
it's very rude to stare!
i'm sorry. i was just wondering
which door to choose.
- what?
- it's no good asking him.
- he's deaf as a post.
- don't talk with your mouth full.
- i'm not talking with my mouth full!
- wait a second.
- i can't understand you.
- what were you saying?
- it is so good to get that thing out.
- what were you saying?
i said, it's no good talking to him.
he's deaf as a post.
mumble, mumble. you're a wonderful
conversational companion.
you can talk!
all you do is moan!
no good. can't hear you.
- where do these doors lead?
- what?
search me.
we're just the knockers.
- how do i get through?
- huh?
knock, and the door will open.
ludo.
i don't want that thing
back in my mouth.
come on. i want to knock.
doesn't want his ring back in his
mouth, eh? can't say i blame him.
- sorry.
- that's all right. i'm used to it.
come on, ludo.
you're welcome.
he's a lively little chap.
i think i'll call him jareth.
he's got my eyes.
ludo scared.
give me your hand.
come on.
imagine a big thing like you
being scared.
yeah.
see, ludo? there's nothing
to be afraid of.
ludo?
ludo, where are you?
ludo?
hoggle, help!
- i'm coming, sarah.
- well, if it isn't you.
and where are you going?
well, the little lady
gave me the slip...
...but i just hears her now.
so i was about to lead her
back to the beginning...
...like you told me.
- i see.
- ludo!
for one moment i thought
you were running to help her.
but no, not after my warnings.
- that would be stupid.
- you bet it would!
me help her
after your warnings?
- oh, dear. poor hoghead.
- hoggle.
i've just noticed
your lovely jewels are missing.
yes, so they are.
my lovely jewels. let me think.
i better find them, but first
i'm off to take the little lady...
...back to the beginning
of the labyrinth like we planned.
wait.
i've got a much better plan.
give her this.
what is it?
it's a present.
it ain't gonna hurt
the little lady, is it?
why the concern?
- i won't do nothing to harm her.
- come, come, hogbrain.
i'm surprised at you
losing your head over a girl.
i ain't lost my head.
you don't think a young girl
could ever like...
...a repulsive little scab
like you, do you?
- she said we was...
- what?
bosom companions?
friends?
- don't matter.
- you'll give her that...
...or i'll tip you straight
into the bog of eternal stench...
...before you can blink.
yes. right.
and hoggle...
...if she ever kisses you,
i'll turn you into a prince.
you...? you will?
prince of the land of stench.
ludo?
what's going on?
- what do you want?
- what, us?
we just have to
have a good time.
that's right!
like the man said,
don't lose your head.
hey, i'm a wild child.
walk tall.
roll 'em.
snake eyes!
hey, lady!
fore!
bad luck.
hey, listen up.
shake your pretty little head.
tap your pretty little feet.
come on! come on!
hey, hey!
her head don't come off.
of course it doesn't!
- she's right. it's stuck on.
- hey, lady.
where you going
with a head like that?
hey, man, i know what we can do.
take off her head!
yeah, let's take her apart.
lady, that's his head.
- that's my head!
- that's a friend of mine.
what are you doing?
hey, lady...
...it's against the rules
to throw other people's heads.
you're only allowed
to throw your own head.
yeah, that's right.
where's the referee?
now we got to take your head off.
- stop her. somebody stop her.
- come back, little lady.
- play the game.
- yeah, we're going to throw your head.
you can't quit.
the game's not over.
- hey, lady!
- leave me alone!
- we get a free throw.
- don't you want to take your head off?
- sure she does.
- grab it!
- don't you want to look like us?
- leave me alone.
it won't hurt! get a saw!
if you play,
we'll take off your arms!
- take off your ear.
- you don't need two ears.
- game's almost over.
- down's up.
- go away.
- hoggle, you've come to help me.
don't kiss me! don't kiss me!
no, no, no!
hoggle, hold on.
oh, my god.
what is it?
the bog of eternal stench!
i've never smelled anything like it.
it's like...
it doesn't matter what it's like.
it's a bog of eternal stench.
help!
hold on.
what did you have to go
and do a thing like that for?
do what?
- you mean rescue you?
- what? no.
you kissed me.
oh, my gosh.
don't pretend to be so hard.
i know you came back to help me,
and i know that you're my friend.
did not. am not.
i just come
to get me property back.
oh, and...
...give you...

the castle well before day.
look, sarah, is this
what you're trying to find?
so much trouble over such
a little thing, but not for long.
she'll soon forget all about you,
my fine fellow.
just as soon as hoggle
gives her my present...
...then she'll forget everything.
is that my stomach or yours,
ambrosius?
hungry.
yeah. well, we can't stop now.
maybe we can find
some berries or something.
sarah.
yeah?

hoggle. thank you!
you're a lifesaver.
this tastes strange.
- hoggle, what have you done?
- damn you, jareth.
and damn me too.
everything's dancing.
yea, verily.
whoa, ambrosius, whoa!
the castle doth lie yonder,
my lady.
my lady?
my lady? my lady?
she'll never forgive me.
what have i done?
i've lost my only friend.
that's what i've done.
what was i doing?
get off my back!
why don't you look
where you're going...
...young woman?
- i was looking.
- huh? huh?
where were you going?
i don't remember.
you can't look where you're going
if you don't know where you're going.
i was searching for something.

...come in here...
...and see if there's
anything else...
...you'd like.
it was just a dream.
i dreamed it all, lancelot.
but it was so real.

ever cared about is all right here.
there's your little toy candy shop.
"through dangers untold...
...and hardships unnumbered...
...i fought my way here
to the castle...
...beyond the goblin city...
...to take back the child
that you have stolen."
what's the matter, my dear?
don't you like your toys?
it's all junk.
well, what about this?
this is not junk, eh?
yes, it is!
i have to save toby!
my lady!

let's go quickly.
we don't have much time.
- yeah.
- right, ambrosius.

well, let them all wake up!
i shall fight you all
to the death!
please, sir didymus,
for my sake, hush.
but of course.
for thee, anything.
- but i'm not a coward?
- no.
- and my sense of smell is keen?
- oh, yes.
then i shall fight anyone
anywhere, any place, anytime!
we know!
now hush.
quietly.
ambrosius, be quiet now.
i don't see why we
have to be so quiet.
it's only a goblin city.
i smell trouble.
come on, ludo.
oh, no.
what is that?
who goes?
watch out!
ambrosius.
ambrosius, will you come here?
ambrosius, come here right now!
will you please come?
oh, but you're embarrassing me.
ludo.
hoggle!

get out of there.
what are you doing?
bombs away!
that wasn't very nice.
my turn now.
how do you drive this thing?
drop the axe!
i'm trying.
come here at once.
where's reverse?
get out of there, hoggle!
abandon ship.
hoggle!
hoggle, are you all right?
i'm not asking to be forgiven.
i ain't ashamed of nothing i did.
jareth made me give you
that peach.
i don't care what you think of me.
i told you i was a coward.
i ain't interested
in being friends.
i forgive you, hoggle.
you...? you do?
and i commend you.
rarely have i seen such courage.
you are a valiant man,
sir hoggle.
i am?
hoggle and ludo friends.
we are?
here are your things, hoggle.
thanks for your help.
well, what are we waiting for?
let's get the rat
who calls himself jareth.
right. come on.
ambrosius, it's safe now.
nothing to be afraid of.
your highness!
your highness, the girl...
- what?
...who ate the peach...
...and forgot everything...
- what of her?
she's here with the monster,
sir didymus and the dwarf.
- what?
- they're on their way to the castle!
stop her! call out the guards.
take the baby and hide it.
- guards!
- she must be stopped.
do something!
come on, move. move!
- i think we're gonna make it.
- piece of cake.
company, halt.
lances ready!
cannon, fire!
ambrosius, turn around.
turn about.
- quick, this way.
- all right. charge!
no, not that way!
you're going the wrong way!
the battle's behind us!
ambrosius, can we please
talk about this?
sit!
be careful. okay.
through here.
ambrosius, stand still.
okay, come on, guys.
ambrosius, if you don't
turn around this second...
...i will never feed you again.
that's better.
don't worry, ambrosius.
i think we've got them surrounded.
didymus! where's didymus?

i hit something, yes? no?
we've got to find didymus.

surrounded?
get out!
ludo, hold the roof!
- take that!
- hungry? all right.
ludo?
ambrosius, unlock this door.
so had enough, have you?
then throw down your weapons,
and i'll see that you're well-treated.
ludo!
next time, surrender.
good grief!
steady, men.
steady, men. hold your ground.
okay, i take it back.
run for your lives!
i've had enough!
i'm going to bed.
get out of my house!
whoa, nellie! duck!
missed!
okay, come on.

hey, i just fired you.
this way.
now we have you!
and now you don't.
hey, no problem.

hi-ho, silver!
- whoa, boy. whoa, big fella.
- this way.
steady, boy.
yes. up we go. up, up.
come on. good boy.
come on.
no.
good boy. come on.
- that's the only way he could've gone.
- well then, come on.
- i have to face him alone.
- but why?
because that's the way it's done.
well, if that is the way
it is done...
...then that is the way
you must do it.
but should you need us...
yes, should you need us...
i'll call.
thank you, all of you.
toby!
toby.
toby!
give me the child.
sarah, beware.
i have been generous up until now,
and i can be cruel.
generous?
- what have you done that's generous?
- everything!
everything that you wanted,
i have done.
you asked that the child be taken.
i took him.
you cowered before me.
i was frightening.
i have reordered time...
...i have turned the world
upside down...
...and i have done it all for you.
i am exhausted from living up
to your expectations of me.
isn't that generous?
through dangers untold
and hardships unnumbered...
...i have fought my way here to
the castle beyond the goblin city.
for my will
is as strong as yours...
...and my...
- stop. wait.
look, sarah.
look what i'm offering you.
your dreams.
and my kingdom as great.
i ask for so little.
just let me rule you...
...and you can have everything
that you want.
kingdom as great.
damn.
i can never remember that line.
just fear me, love me,
do as i say...
...and i will be your slave.
my kingdom as great.
my kingdom as great.
you have no power over me.
toby.
toby? toby?
toby?
here you are.
i'd like lancelot
to belong to you now.
we're home.
sarah, are you home?
yeah. yes, i'm home.
goodbye, sarah.
remember, fair maiden...
...should you need us...
yes, should you need us...
...for any reason at all...
i need you, hoggle.
you do?
i don't know why, but...
...every now and again
in my life...
...for no reason at all,
i need you.
all of you.
you do?
well, why didn't you say so?
- ludo!
- sarah.
ambrosius,
good boy, good boy.
i say, does anyone here
want to play a game of scrabble?
<i>- you remind me of the babe.</i>
<i>- what babe?</i>
<i>- the babe with the power.</i>
<i>- what power?</i>
<i>- the power of voodoo.</i>
<i>- who do?</i>
<i>- you do.</i>
<i>- do what?</i>
<i>remind me of the babe.</i>
