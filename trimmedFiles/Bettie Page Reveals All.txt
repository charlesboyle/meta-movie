ladies and gentlemen,
here she is now.
let's get together
and meet that very delightful,
that sultry siren of the southland,
the lovely bettie page.
<i>( crowd applauding )</i>
<i>( '50s beach music playing )</i>
who are you?
i'm an illusion.
you're an illusion?
then you're not real?
of course, i'm real.
it is very difficult
to find a parallel for her.
i mean, this combination of...
<i>naughty and nice.</i>
<i>and it is all</i>
<i>in the context of innocence.</i>
she expressed sexual liberation.
bettie is still this subversive,
<i>adventurous, sexual persona</i>
<i>that people are trying to emulate.</i>
i think it's like the confusion
between maybe the real person
and the artwork and the cartoons,
like all of these--
it's sort of confusing even
whether she was a real person or not.
people love bettie page
for her whole being
for the radiance that she exuded,
the sexuality that she showed
without being cheap, ever.
and women gravitated to that concept.
the remarkable thing about her image is
how much it has influenced pop culture
from movies to music
to fashion. it's remarkable.
<i>( "bettie page"</i>
<i>by paul spencer playing )</i>
( people chattering )
perez hilton: <i>one of the things</i>
<i>that i love about her iconography</i>
is that she just portrayed
herself as a very strong woman,
even if she was not
in the position of power.
( women scream )
she's lasted because
she has that rare quality
that's sort of hard to define,
it's that sort of ultimate star quality.
i feel like a lot of girls like me
can identify with bettie
<i>because you can</i>
<i>kind of capture the spirit</i>
<i>of that sexy, sensual, timeless look.</i>
she looks fantastic
and i think that's what men prefer.
i don't think men prefer
the really skinny, bones thin women.
i think bettie page is a real woman.
i mean she have form, boobs,
butt, and that's very beautiful.
i gave her a lot of credit because
she opened the door for a lot of us.
she's the most important glamour icon
that she really
paved the way for all the rest.
and she's beautiful
but yet she's approachable,
<i>she's the girl next door.</i>
bettie page is the good girl
but she's a bad girl.
<i>she's fun, she's playful.</i>
all right, bitch, bring it.
( all cheering )
( screams )
oh, st-- ah!
i mean, she's the reason why
we're all here today
in a sense is because of her,
i mean, she's the original pinup girl,
she's the original.
we're all going to be dust,
they'll be nothing else anymore,
and there'll always be
bettie page no matter what.
she had the magic.
she was deeply religious.
she was willing to do
all kinds of crazy outrageous things.
there's some rather large skeletons
in that woman's closet.
how do you reconcile that behavior
with the image that she projects
in these photographs?
she reached the peak of popularity
in her profession and disappeared.
nobody knew
what happened to bettie page.
<i>( avery parrish's</i>
<i>"after hours" playing )</i>
( "amazing grace" playing on bagpipes )
bettie, if you know what's going on,
i want to tell you this is your friend
robert schuller saying,
"this too is the day that god has made.
let us rejoice and be glad in it."
<i>we all thought we knew her</i>
<i>from different perspectives,</i>
but i'm sure no one
will leave this place today
without having had another glimpse
into the private heart of bettie.
mark mori: <i>okay, bettie,</i>
<i>i'll just ask you some questions.</i>
bettie: <i>okay.</i>
mark: <i>you were born in nashville, right?</i>
bettie: <i>i was born</i>
<i>in nashville, tennessee,</i>
<i>april 22nd, 1923.</i>
<i>we were so poor, we lived on beans,</i>
<i>fried potatoes, and macaroni.</i>
<i>you couldn't talk to mama,</i>
<i>she didn't want</i>
<i>any girls in the first place.</i>
<i>she always wanted only two boys.</i>
<i>my father was</i>
<i>a womanizer of the worst sort.</i>
<i>a sex fiend is the way to put it.</i>
<i>i mean sex with anything that</i>
<i>he could get his "you know what" into.</i>
<i>chickens, and sheep,</i>
<i>and cows, and anything.</i>
<i>and in order to get 10 cents</i>
<i>to go to the movies,</i>
<i>i let him fool around on the outside.</i>
<i>now, he didn't penetrate me inside</i>
<i>like he did my two sisters.</i>
<i>mama left him and hitchhiked</i>
<i>30 miles to nashville</i>
<i>with six children,</i>
<i>and she was uneducated,</i>
<i>only a third grade education,</i>
<i>she had no trade at all,</i>
<i>and she couldn't take care</i>
<i>of all six of us children,</i>
<i>so my two sisters and i were put</i>
<i>in a protestant orphanage for a year.</i>
<i>the orphanage was run</i>
<i>by three old maids.</i>
<i>they would talk to us like dogs,</i>
<i>they were very mean to us,</i>
<i>and they had me</i>
<i>scrubbing floors all the time.</i>
<i>i was only 11 years old then.</i>
<i>we just hated that place.</i>
<i>i was so glad to get out of there.</i>
<i>i learned to pose</i>
<i>from movie star pictures</i>
<i>in magazines and newspapers.</i>
<i>and my sisters and i</i>
<i>would try to mimic their poses.</i>
<i>we'd even get out in the front yard</i>
<i>with our underwear on.</i>
<i>( bettie laughs )</i>
<i>i had several photographers</i>
<i>and amateur photographers</i>
<i>come up</i>
<i>and approach me and ask me</i>
<i>if they could take pictures of me,</i>
<i>i always said yes.</i>
<i>my dream when i was in high school</i>
<i>was to be valedictorian,</i>
<i>and i studied so hard</i>
<i>trying to be valedictorian</i>
<i>because with it was a four year</i>
<i>scholarship to vanderbilt university.</i>
<i>but i was beat out of valedictorian</i>
<i>by one-quarter of a point now,</i>
<i>can you imagine, and i had to settle</i>
<i>for being salutatorian.</i>
<i>and all i got</i>
<i>was a $100 scholarship</i>
<i>to george peabody college</i>
<i>for teachers.</i>
<i>after high school,</i>
<i>i started dating billy neal.</i>
<i>he was a big sports hero around town.</i>
<i>and he taught me to dance,</i>
<i>which i've always loved.</i>
<i>and he taught me</i>
<i>everything about sex too,</i>
<i>which i enjoyed.</i>
<i>well, when the war came on,</i>
<i>he was drafted one day into the army,</i>
<i>and he started bugging me</i>
<i>about marrying him.</i>
<i>we got on the bus and went</i>
<i>30 miles to galliton, tennessee,</i>
<i>and were married in five minutes.</i>
<i>and when i got on the bus</i>
<i>to go back with him,</i>
<i>i said to myself, "what have i done?"</i>
<i>well, we were in san francisco, 1 944.</i>
<i>and this fella,</i>
<i>he took a lot of pictures of me</i>
<i>and sent some of them</i>
<i>down to 20th century fox.</i>
<i>i had a screen test with john russell</i>
<i>who later played</i>
<i>the lawman on a tv series.</i>
<i>but that test was awful.</i>
<i>they tried to make me up</i>
<i>to look like joan crawford.</i>
<i>didn't even look like me.</i>
<i>( 20th century fox theme playing )</i>
<i>while i was at the studio,</i>
- <i>this big car pulled up beside me...</i>
- ( wolf whistles )
<i>...and a big fat guy,</i>
<i>very ugly looking fella,</i>
<i>wanted me to go to dinner with him.</i>
<i>i told him no.</i>
<i>and he said, "you'll be sorry. "</i>
<i>well, he was at the head of the table</i>
<i>when i went to learn</i>
<i>the results of the screen test.</i>
<i>that test was awful.</i>
<i>i was so disappointed and unhappy</i>
<i>over the failure of the screen test,</i>
<i>when i got back to san francisco,</i>
<i>i started eating.</i>
<i>within two months,</i>
<i>i ballooned way up to 162 pounds.</i>
<i>well, my sister came to visit me,</i>
<i>goldie, from nashville.</i>
<i>she said that the landlord,</i>
<i>he had cussed her out</i>
<i>and accused her of causing</i>
<i>the sink in the bathroom</i>
<i>to fall off the wall.</i>
<i>i went to the door,</i>
<i>and boy, he flew in on me,</i>
<i>beating me in the face</i>
<i>with his fist, just a mad man.</i>
<i>and goldie grabbed the milk bottle</i>
<i>and cracked him over the head with it.</i>
<i>and he started bleeding</i>
<i>down the front of his head,</i>
<i>and he thought</i>
<i>he was dying, and we did too.</i>
<i>because goldie was underage,</i>
<i>under 21,</i>
<i>i'm the one who had to testify,</i>
<i>even though i'm not the one</i>
<i>who hit him over the head.</i>
<i>but they gave me a 30-day suspended</i>
<i>sentence and i had to pay 10 dollars,</i>
<i>and it was in the paper,</i>
<i>a great big picture of me</i>
<i>and a big headline,</i>
<i>"tenant bashes landlord".</i>
<i>( bettie chuckles )</i>
<i>well, billy came back</i>
<i>from fighting overseas.</i>
<i>he had battle fatigue,</i>
<i>you know, he was in the hospital,</i>
<i>in the army hospital</i>
<i>in guam for about six months.</i>
<i>when he came home,</i>
<i>he wasn't the same guy.</i>
<i>he was a jealous maniac.</i>
<i>accused me of sleeping</i>
<i>with every sailor in san francisco,</i>
<i>and he went off the deep end.</i>
<i>so i tried so hard to make a go of it</i>
<i>with him but it was impossible.</i>
<i>we were sitting in the kitchen,</i>
<i>and he had a knife right at my throat,</i>
<i>he was gonna cut me with it</i>
<i>if i divorced him.</i>
<i>i went ahead</i>
<i>and divorced him anyhow.</i>
<i>when i went to new york,</i>
<i>i was getting over</i>
<i>my divorce from billy neal</i>
<i>and the miserable marriage.</i>
<i>i liked all the lights on broadway.</i>
<i>and i liked central park.</i>
<i>all i paid for my apartment</i>
<i>on west 46th street,</i>
<i>46 dollars and 29 cents a month.</i>
<i>i used to go</i>
<i>to the roseland ballroom.</i>
<i>and then i went dancing so much.</i>
<i>i was a movie fiend in those days.</i>
<i>didn't cost much of anything,</i>
<i>40 or 50 cents,</i>
<i>something like that,</i>
<i>to see a double feature.</i>
<i>one night, i was very lonely,</i>
<i>and i was walking along broadway,</i>
<i>and a good looking fella came up</i>
<i>and started talking to me,</i>
<i>introduced himself.</i>
<i>he was very polite and courteous,</i>
<i>seemed like a very nice fella.</i>
<i>he asked me,</i>
<i>"would like to go dancing?"</i>
<i>i said, "sure, i'd love to go. "</i>
<i>so we got in the car,</i>
<i>and he and i sat in the back,</i>
<i>and the girlfriend</i>
<i>and the boyfriend driving.</i>
<i>well, we stopped at a red light,</i>
<i>and two guys jumped in the car.</i>
<i>we went farther on,</i>
<i>two more fellas got in the car.</i>
<i>but when it hit me,</i>
<i>a big pain shot through me</i>
<i>as we crossed that bridge and i thought,</i>
<i>"we are not going dancing. "</i>
<i>you can imagine</i>
<i>how you would have felt then</i>
<i>with six men in the car</i>
<i>and the two women.</i>
<i>the guy in front and his girlfriend</i>
<i>got out of the car</i>
<i>and went behind the building.</i>
<i>i thought real fast,</i>
<i>and i said i'm menstruating,</i>
<i>you can't have sex with me.</i>
<i>and all five</i>
<i>of those snakes forced me</i>
<i>to perform oral sex</i>
<i>on every one of them.</i>
<i>they could have killed me or something</i>
<i>and left me dead behind that school.</i>
<i>i went home to mama right away,</i>
<i>i was so frightened.</i>
<i>back in new york,</i>
<i>the first secretarial job i ever had</i>
<i>in new york was</i>
<i>for the american bread company.</i>
<i>i was a secretary</i>
<i>to the office manager.</i>
<i>i had a small room up on the fifth floor</i>
<i>of an old brownstone house.</i>
<i>( knocking on door )</i>
<i>somebody knocked</i>
<i>on the door around midnight.</i>
woman: who is it?
<i>and he said,</i>
<i>"bettie, open the door, it's billy. "</i>
- woman: what do you want?
- bettie: <i>"let me in. "</i>
<i>a friend of mine in the next apartment,</i>
<i>a little fella named jimmy,</i>
<i>a 50-year-old man,</i>
<i>came out to the door</i>
<i>and asked what was going on.</i>
<i>well, billy told him</i>
<i>to mind his own business,</i>
<i>and he cut</i>
<i>little jimmy across the face,</i>
<i>a couple of inches with a knife now.</i>
<i>he was going to kill me with a knife</i>
<i>is what he was going to do.</i>
<i>he must have left.</i>
<i>he didn't come back.</i>
<i>i was working</i>
<i>as secretary, way up high</i>
<i>in the eastern airlines building</i>
<i>on the 12th floor,</i>
<i>overlooking the skating rink</i>
<i>in rockefeller center,</i>
<i>a very nice place to work.</i>
<i>and that's where i met the love</i>
<i>of my life, carlos garcia arrese.</i>
<i>( laughs )</i>
<i>you know i was a nut</i>
<i>over dancing back in those days.</i>
<i>and he taught me the rumba,</i>
<i>and mambo, and cha-cha, and samba.</i>
<i>and he was very good at it.</i>
<i>well, we dated</i>
<i>and we were making mad love,</i>
<i>he was a very good lover.</i>
<i>one night i was up at his apartment,</i>
<i>all of a sudden,</i>
<i>a big loud knocking on the door,</i>
<i>"carlos, open up the door,</i>
<i>l know you're in there. "</i>
<i>and she was really mad,</i>
<i>and i thought, oh gosh, who's that?</i>
<i>and he said, "bettie, that's my wife. "</i>
<i>i said, "your wife!"</i>
<i>i never felt so low in my life,</i>
<i>i felt like two cents.</i>
<i>i didn't want to see him again</i>
<i>because he had deceived me.</i>
<i>but if i had known he was married</i>
<i>i would never have dated him.</i>
<i>i always wanted</i>
<i>to be a fashion model.</i>
<i>and i went to-- let's see, what was</i>
<i>the name of the most famous one?</i>
<i>ford, that's it. she says, "oh, my. "</i>
<i>she says, "you would never do</i>
<i>as a fashion model. "</i>
<i>she says, "in the first place,</i>
<i>you're not tall enough. "</i>
<i>but she says, "more than that, "</i>
<i>she says, "you're too hippy. "</i>
<i>you've got to be</i>
<i>skin and bones, you know.</i>
<i>even back then,</i>
<i>to be a fashion model.</i>
<i>in october 1 950,</i>
<i>i was walking out on coney island.</i>
<i>nobody was on the beach in that area,</i>
<i>except this black fella, jerry tibbs.</i>
<i>he gave me his card and he said,</i>
<i>"i'm a brooklyn policeman. "</i>
<i>he said, "i think you'd make</i>
<i>a good pinup modei. "</i>
<i>he said, "l have a studio,</i>
<i>if you wouid come over there</i>
<i>free of charge,</i>
<i>i'll make you up a portfolio</i>
<i>that you could</i>
<i>take around to the studios. "</i>
<i>i posed in a couple of bikinis of his.</i>
<i>but he said, "bettie, have you ever</i>
<i>tried to wear bangs?"</i>
<i>he said, "you have a very high forehead,</i>
<i>i think you'd look good in bangs. "</i>
<i>so i went home and cut me some.</i>
<i>and i've been wearing them ever since,</i>
<i>its sort of been a trademark of mine,</i>
<i>i'm still wearing them.</i>
mark: <i>that's that</i>
<i>famous bettie page look, isn't it?</i>
<i>( bettie laughs )</i>
bettie: <i>i think i was about 27</i>
<i>when i started modeling,</i>
<i>but i looked much younger.</i>
<i>all of the writers and editors</i>
<i>would say i was 22 years old,</i>
<i>they were saying that</i>
<i>for years that i was 22.</i>
<i>i never refuted it, i never said</i>
<i>anything one way or another,</i>
<i>let them think what they wanted to.</i>
<i>( bettie laughs )</i>
<i>the first modeling i did</i>
<i>was for the camera clubs.</i>
<i>first one was cass carr</i>
<i>who was an orchestra leader.</i>
every sunday we'd say we're going out
to headly farm
in new jersey or some other farm,
or we're going out to fire island
or broad channel bay.
bettie page and four other amateur
models will be with them,
<i>and it would cost</i>
<i>ten dollars or five dollars.</i>
bettie: <i>there would be maybe</i>
<i>30 or 40 camera club members</i>
<i>and three or four models.</i>
<i>we would go</i>
<i>on field trips, on weekends,</i>
<i>upstate new york, over in new jersey,</i>
<i>on the beaches,</i>
<i>especially on fire island.</i>
<i>i got 25 dollars a day.</i>
<i>and we would be gone all afternoon</i>
<i>and they would bring lunches,</i>
<i>and i enjoyed</i>
<i>the outings very much.</i>
<i>they were always polite</i>
<i>and courteous to us.</i>
<i>i enjoyed posing for them.</i>
it was absolutely fun
photographing bettie.
<i>and i could tell, i think</i>
<i>it shows up in the photographs,</i>
<i>that she enjoyed it too.</i>
<i>she was happy.</i>
<i>she was exhilarated.</i>
<i>she projected.</i>
<i>she came right out at you.</i>
<i>whereas others were just pretty.</i>
when she turned,
she didn't just turn and smile,
<i>her hands, her body, her feet,</i>
<i>everything moved, everything moved.</i>
<i>she smiled with her face,</i>
<i>she smiled with her whole body.</i>
<i>and that's something very few girls got.</i>
amsie: <i>the good pinup</i>
<i>involves three things:</i>
<i>pose, clothes, and expression.</i>
she knew just when i said, pert, saucy,
frisky, haughty, angry, sullen,
whereas with many other models
i'd have to tell them,
"well, no, tilt
your head up a little bit,"
"move it up like that,"
"raise your eyes," etcetera.
<i>she would pop up</i>
<i>into that right away.</i>
bettie: <i>i was very happy posing.</i>
<i>and i never had any problem</i>
<i>thinking of what to do with my body.</i>
<i>i could think of a thousand different</i>
<i>poses that just came natural to me.</i>
<i>sometimes i would imagine</i>
<i>the camera was my boyfriend.</i>
<i>and i would play to my boyfriend.</i>
amsie: <i>all i do know is that</i>
<i>when bettie page was announced</i>
<i>as being the feature model</i>
<i>of next sunday's shoot,</i>
<i>there was a big crowd.</i>
mark: <i>did the guys in the camera clubs</i>
<i>ask you out for dates a lot?</i>
bettie: <i>no.</i>
<i>now i wouldn't date anybody</i>
<i>who drank or smoke.</i>
<i>i just don't like the taste</i>
<i>of cigarettes on your breath,</i>
<i>and i hate alcohol.</i>
one of the most interesting
characters in this entire story
was richard arbib,
<i>one of her ex-boyfriends.</i>
<i>he was a top designer of the '50s.</i>
<i>designed cars, watches,</i>
<i>extremely well known designer.</i>
<i>richard had split up with his wife,</i>
<i>and met bettie,</i>
<i>and they had a red hot romance,</i>
<i>they were deeply in love.</i>
<i>he took her</i>
<i>in his two seater down to florida.</i>
arbib:
<i>well, we just decided we'd take off</i>
<i>and go to florida for three weeks.</i>
<i>she wanted to have sex with me</i>
<i>in the car and i said,</i>
<i>"if you're going to do that, i've got</i>
<i>to stop 'cause i'll go off the road. "</i>
<i>so she's going away at me,</i>
<i>and all of a sudden</i>
<i>there's a flashlight in the door,</i>
<i>it was raining cats and dogs,</i>
<i>there's a state trooper there.</i>
<i>and i thought he was going to arrest us</i>
<i>for having sex in the car.</i>
<i>all he said was, "you all know</i>
<i>you've got one tail light out. "</i>
<i>bettie had a very normal sex life.</i>
<i>she wasn't inhibited,</i>
<i>she wasn't hung up in any way at all.</i>
<i>she liked sex</i>
<i>and she was very good at it.</i>
theakson: <i>arbib told me</i>
<i>he designed a watch for bettie.</i>
<i>it was a custom made piece</i>
<i>for bettie page.</i>
<i>he was renowned for his watches.</i>
<i>this was a unique</i>
<i>one of a kind piece.</i>
<i>he presented it to her</i>
<i>and she wore it proudly.</i>
<i>and for some reason,</i>
<i>richard decided that</i>
<i>he was going to give it</i>
<i>one more shot with his wife,</i>
<i>and it didn't work out with his wife,</i>
<i>and when he came back,</i>
<i>bettie was gone.</i>
<i>and that was the regret of his life.</i>
all of the guys that i knew
that met this woman,
had this, "the one that got away"
ennui about them.
she wasn't just a pretty face with
nothing behind it, she was not a facade.
she had a high iq.
<i>and had a great range</i>
<i>of things that interested her.</i>
bettie:
<i>i used to make a lot of my clothes.</i>
<i>i made all my bikinis,</i>
<i>most of my lingerie.</i>
<i>i enjoyed making them.</i>
bettie used to design stuff.
<i>she could have made a fortune.</i>
<i>'cause she had an eye for it,</i>
<i>she knew what was sexy.</i>
bettie: <i>bikinis were never heard of</i>
<i>on the beaches in this country.</i>
<i>( big band music playing )</i>
male announcer: <i>don't know what</i>
<i>the wild waves are saying,</i>
<i>but the gals are talking about</i>
<i>the latest thing in swimming attire.</i>
<i>a suit with a built in girdle.</i>
bettie: <i>i made them real skimpy.</i>
<i>it was considered very risqué.</i>
<i>one of the jobs i had in new york</i>
<i>was with a couple</i>
<i>down in greenwich village.</i>
<i>well, they had me bring</i>
<i>every one of my costumes,</i>
<i>especially all my bikinis.</i>
<i>and i wondered why they had me</i>
<i>change costumes so many times.</i>
<i>and then they had taken my designs</i>
<i>from the pictures they'd took of me</i>
<i>and had them</i>
<i>manufactured under my name</i>
<i>and selling them</i>
<i>as "bettie page's bikinis" now.</i>
<i>i should have sued them or something,</i>
<i>but i didn't do anything about it.</i>
<i>the first bona fide</i>
<i>commercial work i did</i>
<i>was for robert harrison's magazines.</i>
<i>you know,</i>
<i>he had five or six girly books.</i>
<i>wink, titter, flirt, beauty parade.</i>
<i>they had four</i>
<i>or five writers in the back room</i>
<i>that made up all kinds</i>
<i>of crazy things we had to act out.</i>
<i>but one thing i didn't like</i>
<i>and none of the other girls did either,</i>
<i>robert harrison insisted</i>
<i>that our breasts be taped.</i>
<i>he was a nut about the cleavage.</i>
<i>i'd have to hold my breasts together,</i>
<i>and they put a great big thick</i>
<i>two-inches wide tape,</i>
<i>all the way across.</i>
<i>i hated that.</i>
<i>mr. harrison said,</i>
<i>"bettie, i want you to represent</i>
<i>my magazines at the artists ball. "</i>
<i>they have a contest</i>
<i>for the best costume.</i>
<i>and guess what i was wearing?</i>
<i>just two telephone dials,</i>
<i>one over this breast, one over this,</i>
<i>and a suggestion box,</i>
<i>and black net stockings up to the waist,</i>
<i>and that was it, and i won it that year,</i>
<i>and i got a whole set</i>
<i>of revere kitchen ware.</i>
<i>( bettie laughs )</i>
<i>( patriotic classical music playing )</i>
announcer: <i>estes kefauver of the senate</i>
<i>crime investigation fame</i>
<i>brings the democratic</i>
<i>political pot to boil</i>
<i>by announcing his candidacy</i>
<i>for the presidential nomination.</i>
bettie: <i>senator estes kefauver.</i>
<i>he's from my home state, you know.</i>
<i>he was trying to drum up votes,</i>
<i>and get the public on his side,</i>
<i>by going after juvenile delinquency</i>
<i>and pornography.</i>
what i expected,
having served in world war ii,
which i thought was a fight
for democracy and liberation,
<i>what i expected after world war ii was</i>
something like what i perceived
as the "roaring '20s" was like
after world war i, a huge celebration.
<i>and what we actually got</i>
<i>was repression.</i>
repression on several fronts,
it was social and sexual and political.
man: <i>are you now or have you ever been</i>
<i>a member of the communist party?</i>
the thing that
the american people can do
is to be vigilant, day and night.
to make sure
they don't have communists
teaching the sons
and daughters of america.
we have an image of the fifties
as a time when everything was placid
and everybody lived in
a sort of ozzie and harriet life,
<i>but going on</i>
<i>at the same time in the culture</i>
was an enormous amount of fear
of infiltration of new things
<i>that were going</i>
<i>to undermine and infect the culture,</i>
<i>and make</i>
<i>the youth of america delinquents,</i>
<i>as the term that had been invented.</i>
and a lot of it focused on pornography.
male announcer:
<i>the peddling of obscene books,</i>
<i>a furtive and despicable occupation</i>
<i>has become a lucrative sideline</i>
<i>for unscrupulous shopkeepers</i>
<i>in some high school neighborhoods.</i>
smith: <i>people basically,</i>
<i>i think, felt that anything</i>
<i>that got people sexually</i>
<i>excited was a bad thing.</i>
<i>i mean, even to talk about sex</i>
<i>in the 1 950s was a taboo.</i>
the postmaster general
had a very visible campaign
of trying to suppress
the use of the mails
to deliver sexually explicit materials.
<i>postal inspectors could open your mail,</i>
<i>they could confiscate it,</i>
<i>they could come</i>
<i>and do raids on your premises</i>
<i>to keep you from mailing</i>
<i>material at another time.</i>
<i>of course they could</i>
<i>turn you over to the prosecution.</i>
so they had a great deal
of power at their disposal.
anything that would be
perceived as being lewd,
a term pretty broad,
could be treated as a crime
if you circulated it through the mail.
and certainly nudity alone
was considered enough to be obscene
by the standards
of the authorities at the time.
bettie: <i>i don't even believe god</i>
<i>disapproves of nudity,</i>
<i>after all, he put adam and eve</i>
<i>in the garden of eden</i>
<i>naked as jaybirds.</i>
<i>as a part of posing for the camera club,</i>
<i>most of it was in bikinis,</i>
<i>but sometimes there would be</i>
<i>a few shots topless.</i>
theakson: <i>bettie page was very sexual,</i>
<i>but in a very free</i>
<i>and innocent kind of way.</i>
<i>she's gorgeous</i>
<i>and she makes you feel good.</i>
<i>she makes direct eye contact with you,</i>
<i>and it's engaging.</i>
i've seen her work
with some very shy newcomers,
<i>and actually help them out.</i>
<i>bettie would suggest something,</i>
<i>"how 'bout this one,</i>
<i>how 'bout this one,</i>
<i>how 'bout this one?"</i>
<i>and that way she would</i>
<i>get him out of his shell.</i>
theakson:<i>bettie is sexuality</i>
<i>in it's sparkly, cleanest,</i>
<i>most beautiful, charming, smilingest.</i>
theakson: <i>but there was some discussion</i>
<i>about the kind of women</i>
<i>that would do camera club shoots</i>
<i>because primarily they were nude,</i>
<i>totally nude shoots.</i>
<i>and bettie would say,</i>
<i>"whenever there was</i>
<i>a shoot that i was attending,</i>
<i>where things started</i>
<i>getting sketchy, i got out of there. "</i>
amsie: <i>everybody would have</i>
<i>liked to date bettie page,</i>
<i>but nobody made the moves.</i>
mark: <i>are there any boyfriends</i>
<i>of bettie that you know of,</i>
<i>that you've talked to her</i>
<i>that you know of?.</i>
i talked to a lot of guys,
not only photographers, but her lovers.
<i>charles west was one of them.</i>
<i>apparently met her</i>
<i>through a camera club.</i>
<i>he did a notorious series</i>
<i>of photographs with bettie.</i>
charles west: <i>one day, a saturday,</i>
<i>she and i were walking</i>
<i>down 5th ave. at rockefeller center.</i>
<i>she wore that same</i>
<i>tight translucent sweater.</i>
<i>we were on our way to a shooting session</i>
<i>in the time life building.</i>
<i>you should have seen the swiveling</i>
<i>heads, both male and female.</i>
<i>my god, wasn't she beautiful.</i>
<i>gorgeous.</i>
<i>my photos were taken very privately,</i>
<i>i never intended</i>
<i>for any of them to be published.</i>
<i>god gave her a lovely body</i>
<i>and she knew it.</i>
<i>as a model,</i>
<i>she used it to full advantage.</i>
<i>her body was</i>
<i>absolutely without blemish,</i>
<i>and everything</i>
<i>exactly right in proportion.</i>
<i>and that was the same with her face,</i>
<i>and you put the two together,</i>
<i>and you had</i>
<i>just about the perfect woman.</i>
<i>there was also a very sheer</i>
<i>pair of white panties.</i>
<i>also, super long black</i>
<i>opera length gloves.</i>
<i>she was absolutely pure,</i>
<i>plain and natural.</i>
<i>and of course she shows up</i>
<i>that way in her photographs.</i>
<i>and i just think</i>
<i>you see the real girl there.</i>
<i>no one ever dominated betts,</i>
<i>either physically or psychologically.</i>
<i>she was her own person and she never</i>
<i>could have mistreated anyone.</i>
<i>yes, she and i made love.</i>
<i>and she was marvelous.</i>
<i>she's an extraordinary creature.</i>
<i>my memories of betts are ever present.</i>
nudity back then was, was very unusual.
<i>that was '52,</i>
<i>a time of restrictive sexuality.</i>
<i>you talked</i>
<i>to your friends in college even,</i>
<i>and the fellow</i>
<i>who had been sexually active</i>
was the unusual guy.
know when and how
you're going to say "no".
<i>take the case of the girl</i>
<i>who finds herself in this situation.</i>
girl in car:
say, is anybody else hungry?
how about it you two, couldn't we go
someplace for something to eat?
heinlein: <i>i was on my way</i>
<i>into the army at that time,</i>
<i>on my way to korea eventually.</i>
<i>so i thought it was a time</i>
<i>to have a little bit of fun.</i>
bettie:
<i>we were upstate new york on a farm.</i>
mark: <i>but maybe this have been</i>
<i>your first opportunity</i>
<i>to see a woman without</i>
<i>much clothes on?</i>
ah, that's not a bad guess.
( laughter )
heinlein: <i>the photographers</i>
<i>all sort of gravitated to bettie page.</i>
<i>you were drawn as if by a magnet.</i>
<i>she lit up the place.</i>
<i>i don't think</i>
<i>anybody can really explain</i>
<i>why some people</i>
<i>have that kind of charisma.</i>
<i>it was kind of</i>
<i>a revolution for me really</i>
<i>to see that openness.</i>
bettie: <i>somebody went</i>
<i>to the police about it,</i>
<i>some old fogy no doubt,</i>
<i>went to the police and said</i>
<i>we were running around</i>
<i>in the woods nude out there.</i>
<i>and here came a squad car.</i>
man: <i>calling car 6 and 7 eighths,</i>
<i>car 6 and 7 eighths.</i>
heinlein:
<i>here they are coming with drawn guns,</i>
<i>coming on a bunch of photographers.</i>
i mean, what were we going to do?
<i>i mean, this is absolute nonsense.</i>
and they said, "also, take
the pictures out of your cameras."
<i>i opened the back of the camera.</i>
the counter, which may have been,
say on film number 5,
<i>well, i snapped back to zero.</i>
<i>i immediately closed the camera</i>
<i>and thought to myself,</i>
why not try to keep
what films i have in the camera.
and i showed it to one
of the deputies and i said,
<i>"look, you see, the counter's on zero,</i>
<i>but to tell you the truth</i>
<i>i have a new roll in there,</i>
<i>i'd rather not expose it</i>
<i>by opening the back. "</i>
<i>i said, "okay if i keep it that way?"</i>
<i>and he said sure.</i>
<i>but i didn't come upon the idea</i>
<i>of holding onto those photos</i>
<i>until i saw it snap back to zero.</i>
<i>the charming thing was that</i>
<i>a little kitten wandered by.</i>
<i>and she picked it up,</i>
<i>and she held it to her breast.</i>
<i>i found that exquisite.</i>
<i>and i did take a picture of that</i>
<i>but half of it was destroyed.</i>
one of the deputies said something,
which was rather nasty,
but i do remember her saying,
<i>"don't you talk to me like that.</i>
<i>i won't have it. "</i>
<i>and i think she had more courage</i>
<i>than the dozen and a half</i>
<i>photographers that were there.</i>
they decided to charge the guys
for disturbing the peace,
<i>and the girls for indecent exposure.</i>
heinlein:
<i>she was just terribly offended by it.</i>
menning:
<i>bettie says, "i'm not indecent.</i>
<i>i will not plead guilty to that. "</i>
bettie:
<i>and we sat there in the anteroom,</i>
<i>outside the court room for five hours.</i>
<i>( menning speaking )</i>
theakson: <i>bettie demanded</i>
<i>that this release form be rewritten</i>
<i>so that it didn't say</i>
<i>"indecent exposure".</i>
bettie: <i>and the judge warned us</i>
<i>never to come in his county again.</i>
<i>( bettie chuckles )</i>
theakson: <i>her being put in jail</i>
<i>because she was posing,</i>
<i>making a living,</i>
<i>gave her pause for thought.</i>
<i>she really had never considered</i>
<i>that it could happen to her.</i>
<i>and in fact, it was an alarm</i>
<i>to wake her up to the fact</i>
<i>that a lot of people</i>
<i>did not like what she was doing.</i>
<i>( dramatic classical music playing )</i>
on friday, we shall continue
the investigation of the relationship
of pornographic
materials to delinquency.
hefner: <i>in the 1950s,</i>
<i>the repression</i>
<i>was coming from the government.</i>
and it also involved kefauver
and his investigations,
in terms of pornography and crime.
you couldn't sell in many places
a magazine that had the kinds of nudity
that we see in a modern <i>playboy.</i>
<i>that was considered going too far.</i>
bettie: <i>i never had any bad feelings</i>
<i>about posing in the nude</i>
<i>or semi-nude outfits.</i>
<i>i found out i could make</i>
<i>more money posing in two hours</i>
<i>than i'd make all week as a secretary.</i>
<i>all the girls</i>
<i>who worked for robert harrison</i>
<i>would end up posing for lrving klaw.</i>
<i>he had a big business,</i>
<i>he and his sister paula,</i>
<i>selling movie star pictures</i>
<i>before they got into, locally,</i>
<i>shooting models in new york.</i>
and one of the cameramen
brought her in and said,
she's a super model, she works well,
and she's a love, give her a shot.
<i>and we did.</i>
<i>you should have seen her then.</i>
<i>the long black hair</i>
<i>and always smiling,</i>
<i>giggling and whatever,</i>
<i>she was so great to work with.</i>
<i>she loved posing.</i>
bettie: <i>irving klaw,</i>
<i>he was a real sweet fella.</i>
<i>he was a big fat chubby guy.</i>
<i>and he was sort of short</i>
<i>and he was almost bald.</i>
<i>but he was so nice.</i>
<i>he never made any passes</i>
<i>at the women or anything.</i>
<i>they would bring food there,</i>
<i>sandwiches and all for us.</i>
<i>they were always</i>
<i>very generous about that.</i>
paula klaw: <i>he got some of the ideas</i>
<i>from some of the customers.</i>
<i>and he would sort of talk to me about,</i>
<i>"what do you think of this</i>
<i>and what do you think of that",</i>
<i>and between the two of us</i>
<i>we'd figure it out.</i>
in some of her earliest
irving klaw photos,
bettie looked a little gawky.
<i>but klaw would give her</i>
<i>a set of these photos.</i>
<i>she could summarize</i>
<i>what she was doing right</i>
<i>and what she was doing wrong,</i>
<i>and i think she became</i>
<i>a much better model.</i>
paula klaw:
<i>she liked being in front of the camera.</i>
<i>she enjoyed her body.</i>
<i>she liked the way she looked.</i>
<i>she liked her hair.</i>
<i>she enjoyed herself.</i>
<i>she never cried about anything--</i>
<i>"it's too tight, '"'it's too loose, "</i>
<i>"don't do that, " or anything.</i>
<i>she was just a super lady to work with.</i>
bettie: <i>irving said i was</i>
<i>his most famous model that he ever had,</i>
<i>and he had some</i>
<i>1,500 pictures of me going.</i>
<i>a lot of them to service men.</i>
paula klaw: <i>we made this set</i>
<i>of pictures, we'd advertise it,</i>
<i>and we noticed the increase in sales.</i>
bettie: <i>one of the biggest sellers</i>
<i>is a picture of me wearing</i>
<i>my little leopard-skin bikini,</i>
<i>and i'm looking real mean,</i>
<i>holding this whip</i>
<i>with one foot up on a stool</i>
<i>and a cigarette dangling</i>
<i>out the side of my mouth.</i>
<i>and the teenagers.</i>
<i>irving said that's</i>
<i>their favorite picture of me now.</i>
<i>you know, i never smoked.</i>
<i>( bettie laughs )</i>
<i>i hate cigarettes.</i>
well, i shot stills but there was
more money into making films
so we started with the 16mm,
because that was
very popular at that time.

<i>that fitted me just fine</i>
<i>that i could wiggle around,</i>

<i>teaserama is a complete,</i>
<i>all new burlesque show,</i>
<i>filmed in beautiful new eastman color.</i>
<i>teaserama features the world's</i>
<i>most beautiful, exotic girls.</i>

<i>with a 40-plus bust,</i>
<i>who goes 3d two better!</i>
<i>so big, we had to use</i>
<i>wide screen to film teaserama.</i>
<i>bettie page,</i>
<i>the nation's top pinup queen.</i>
<i>there's sexy seconds</i>
<i>to every minute in teaserama.</i>
bettie: <i>in one of them starring</i>
<i>tempest storm, i played her maid.</i>
<i>and i also introduced the acts</i>
<i>wearing my bikinis and other costumes.</i>
<i>and then i did a little dance number.</i>
<i>it was a nothing tap dance i made up</i>
<i>within a half an hour</i>
<i>before the movie was to be shot.</i>
paula klaw: <i>there was no sex</i>
<i>in those movies that we shot.</i>
<i>it was just fun.</i>
bettie: <i>irving klaw would pay me $150</i>
<i>every time i did one of these movies.</i>
<i>and i would take the money</i>
<i>and go to visit my mother in pittsburgh,</i>
<i>or my brothers in nashville,</i>
<i>or my sister in coral gables.</i>
bettie happened to be in miami
on a little vacation.
<i>and she gave me a call.</i>
<i>and she said she was</i>
<i>a new york model.</i>
and i said, "oh,"
and i was very impressed.
bettie: <i>i posed for bunny</i>
<i>in florida in the spring of 1954.</i>
<i>she had just started out</i>
<i>as a photographer,</i>
<i>she used to be a pinup model.</i>
i said, "you do pinup modeling?"
and she says, "i do nudes, too."
and when i heard that
she did nudes, i was really excited
because i had never photographed
<i>a professional nude model before.</i>
<i>so i told her to come on over,</i>
<i>i would use her sight unseen.</i>
<i>bettie was so perfect in every way.</i>
<i>it would be hard for anybody</i>
<i>to take a bad picture of bettie.</i>
bettie: <i>because she was a woman,</i>
<i>i felt more comfortable</i>
<i>posing in the nude for bunny.</i>
<i>and we'd go out there</i>
<i>about 7:00 in the morning</i>
<i>before anybody came on the beaches</i>
<i>and do our shooting then.</i>
<i>( "casbah" by</i>
<i>los straightjackets playing )</i>
bunny: <i>we worked so well together</i>
<i>because she caught on</i>
<i>to what i was trying to get out of her.</i>
<i>and she just played like she was</i>
<i>a teenager in front of the camera,</i>
<i>and followed</i>
<i>every direction i gave her.</i>
<i>and that was a thrill too,</i>
<i>because i had not worked</i>
<i>with somebody that professional before.</i>
<i>you knew she was trying</i>
<i>to look her very best.</i>
<i>she would work on her tan</i>
<i>and sunbathe the nude</i>
<i>for a certain time everyday</i>
<i>so that her skin would be so glorious.</i>
<i>bettie had a different torso</i>
<i>than most girls.</i>
<i>her bone structure there,</i>
<i>close to her waistline,</i>
<i>went way in to a very tiny waist.</i>
<i>and there are very few girls</i>
<i>that are built like that.</i>
bettie: <i>i was 36-24-37.</i>
<i>i worked out</i>
<i>at the health club three times a week.</i>
<i>i've always liked to exercise.</i>
<i>i wanted to keep in shape</i>
<i>for my modeling.</i>
bunny: <i>she lied to me about her age.</i>
<i>she told me she was 24 when she posed</i>
<i>for me but she was much older.</i>
<i>i think that she was 32.</i>
<i>we shot pictures at kiddie land park.</i>
<i>and i put her in a bikini</i>
<i>and shot her on the merry-go-round</i>
<i>and all these stupid rides.</i>
<i>and she, she had a ball, you know.</i>
<i>we had to go</i>
<i>before they opened up at 10:00</i>
<i>because i was getting worried</i>
<i>with the briefness of the bathing suits.</i>
<i>i was a little scared and i thought,</i>
<i>"bettie, we might get arrested.</i>
<i>how do you feel about that?"</i>
<i>and he says, "oh, i wouldn't</i>
<i>want to, but you know.</i>
<i>what are we going to do?"</i>
so we just took our chances.
<i>so they're very sensual pictures.</i>
<i>very sexy.</i>
<i>( boat motor humming )</i>
bunny: <i>we went out on the boat</i>
<i>and it was late in the afternoon,</i>
<i>and the sun was already getting low.</i>
<i>but that made for</i>
<i>good shadowing of bettie's body</i>
<i>for some beautiful nudes on the boat.</i>
<i>and she actually caught a fish</i>
<i>while i was shooting her.</i>
it was unbelievable.
<i>i had never seen anybody</i>
<i>catch a fish so fast.</i>
<i>we must have been in good waters.</i>
<i>but that picture that you see</i>
<i>of bettie holding the fish up.</i>
<i>that was for real.</i>
while we were shooting
some pinups on the beach one day,
i asked bettie,
"are you afraid of wild animals?"
<i>( tribal music playing )</i>
bunny: <i>i had seen</i>
<i>too many tarzan movies, i think.</i>
bettie: <i>she set up a session</i>
<i>for me up in boca raton</i>
<i>at little africa</i>
<i>to pose with the animals.</i>
bunny: <i>when you come into africa usa,</i>
<i>they had a greeter at the gate,</i>
<i>dressed all up like a native.</i>
<i>i said, "would you like to take</i>
<i>some pictures with my model?"</i>
<i>he said, "sure. "</i>
<i>he was happy about that.</i>
bettie: <i>i was very fond</i>
<i>of my one-piece outfit</i>
<i>that i made</i>
<i>with the scallops and high bottoms.</i>
<i>i was dressed just like a cheetah.</i>
<i>there wasn't much to the bottom of it,</i>
<i>but maybe that was</i>
<i>the most alluring part of it.</i>
<i>i was very proud of that design.</i>
<i>( bettie laughs )</i>
bettie: <i>the pictures that sold the most</i>
<i>were with two cheetahs.</i>
<i>beautiful animals.</i>
<i>they had been sick the night before</i>
<i>and they were in a bad temper.</i>
<i>i was afraid to be around 'em.</i>
bunny: <i>the trainer said, "please,</i>
<i>don't let go of that chain, bettie,</i>
<i>because if they run,</i>
<i>they run 55 miles and hour</i>
<i>and they'll be gone. "</i>
<i>she kept control,</i>
<i>and we got great pictures.</i>
<i>all my life i had worshiped</i>
<i>these pinup girls</i>
<i>on the calendars, and i thought,</i>
<i>"i'd love to shoot a calendar</i>
<i>of someone as beautiful as bettie. "</i>
and i thought, the holiday season
will be coming up soon.
<i>and i had</i>
<i>this little white christmas tree.</i>
<i>and i had her pose,</i>
<i>kneeling on a white shag rug.</i>
bettie: <i>i didn't know that bunny yeager</i>
<i>was going to send pictures</i>
<i>to mr. hefner for playboy magazine.</i>
hefner: <i>she was miss january of 1955,</i>
<i>but bettie had a fame</i>
<i>that kind of coincided</i>
<i>and predated</i>
<i>her appearance in playboy.</i>
bettie:
<i>you know, that little santa claus hat</i>
<i>and i'm winking,</i>
<i>and i'm sitting on my knees</i>
<i>with a little christmas tree ball</i>
<i>covering "you know where".</i>
<i>( bettie laughs )</i>
she had a very unique look
and also a very unique attitude.
bettie: <i>back in new york,</i>
<i>you couldn't work for lrving</i>
<i>without doing about an hour</i>
<i>or an hour and a half of bondage,</i>
<i>or you didn't get paid.</i>
<i>bondage, i'm noted for being</i>
<i>the number one</i>
<i>bondage queen, they call me.</i>
<i>( bettie laughs )</i>
<i>most of the work came</i>
<i>from requests he would get in the mail,</i>
<i>from doctors, lawyers,</i>
<i>businessmen,</i>
<i>men up in high society even,</i>
<i>wanted all of these things.</i>
paula klaw: <i>one was a big official</i>
<i>in the government</i>
<i>and one guy was a big lawyer.</i>
mark: <i>are either</i>
<i>of these guys still alive?</i>
no, i don't think so.
<i>so you care to say who they were?</i>
no. promises.
paula klaw: <i>the guy came in</i>
<i>with all the rubber outfits.</i>
<i>and there was leather.</i>
<i>there's a big leather fetish out there.</i>
<i>men wanted her with the boots on.</i>
<i>pay for it,</i>
<i>bring the costumes, we'll do it.</i>
bettie: <i>for some reason,</i>
<i>men like to see girls,</i>
<i>one spanking the other one.</i>
<i>why, i don't know.</i>
<i>and they liked</i>
<i>to see women helpless, tied up.</i>
<i>i never thought it was anything strange.</i>
theakson: <i>bettie had not been exposed</i>
<i>to this type of culture.</i>
she was instructed
that this is what the job was.
to her it was acting.
<i>which she enjoyed doing,</i>
<i>which is why her bondage stuff</i>
<i>is just so terrific,</i>
<i>because she's acting.</i>
<i>she's making believe</i>
<i>that she's terrified.</i>
<i>for the most part,</i>
<i>anybody in a bondage photograph is</i>
<i>just going on</i>
<i>like half-assed, hardly doing it.</i>
<i>bettie was acting.</i>
bettie: <i>paula, she was the only one</i>
<i>that ever tied us up.</i>
<i>she didn't hurt us,</i>
<i>she was very careful about it.</i>
paula klaw:
<i>she felt safe with me being there.</i>
don't hurt the babies, you know.
bettie: <i>some of the pictures</i>
<i>looked like i was really being hurt.</i>
<i>there was only one time</i>
<i>that i was ever frightened.</i>
<i>some guy, some lawyer</i>
<i>i think he was, wanted me tied up.</i>
<i>and my feet were off the ground</i>
<i>about six inches.</i>
<i>i thought my arm holes</i>
<i>were going to pull out of the sockets.</i>
<i>and i said,</i>
<i>"hurry up, it's hurting me. "</i>
<i>and they kept shooting me</i>
<i>from all kinds of angles.</i>
<i>and finally they let me down.</i>
<i>and irving later told me</i>
<i>that those pictures sold more</i>
<i>than any picture that he'd ever sold</i>
<i>of movie stars than anybody else.</i>
<i>( bettie laughs )</i>
<i>about two months later...</i>
<i>i was doing</i>
<i>a little 16mm wrestling movie.</i>
<i>i heard something pop.</i>
<i>i couldn't straighten out</i>
<i>my right knee at all.</i>
<i>finally, i called a doctor.</i>
<i>he said,</i>
<i>"it'll be about a six inch scar. "</i>
<i>he said, "you won't be able</i>
<i>to do your pinup modeling anymore. "</i>
<i>i was lying in bed</i>
<i>feeling very unhappy</i>
<i>at the thought that</i>
<i>i wouldn't be able to model anymore.</i>
<i>and all of a sudden,</i>
<i>i heard a man's voice</i>
<i>just as loud and clear</i>
<i>as you'd hear any human talk.</i>
<i>he said, "bettie, you can</i>
<i>straighten out your knee. try it. "</i>
<i>and within a couple of seconds</i>
<i>i was able to straighten out my knee.</i>
<i>i knew immediately</i>
<i>it was the voice of god.</i>
theakson: <i>she was the girl next door.</i>
just so good,
and went to church on sunday,
that women identified with,
that they liked the idea
that they could exude sexuality
<i>and not be thought of as a tramp,</i>
<i>that she's playing a role,</i>
<i>whether it be dominatrix</i>
<i>or the girl next door,</i>
and it was never demeaning
at any point whatsoever.
bettie: <i>the craziest request i ever had,</i>
<i>this guy wanted me to pose</i>
<i>in a black leather pony outfit</i>
<i>that he sent to irving and paula.</i>
<i>i had to get on all fours like a horse,</i>
<i>and my head covered up</i>
<i>with this hood on.</i>
<i>i said, "well, how would he even know</i>
<i>who was under there at all?"</i>
<i>you couldn't even see my face.</i>
<i>we died laughing about it.</i>
and some we turned away.
<i>well, there were no nudes,</i>
<i>that's number one.</i>
<i>if there were men</i>
<i>in the pictures, it was pornographic.</i>
and we didn't want to sell
anything that was pornographic.
<i>( menning speaking )</i>
<i>( knocking on door )</i>
bettie: <i>these two guys</i>
<i>came to me and said,</i>
<i>"bettie, we want you to testify</i>
<i>against irving klaw as a pornographer. "</i>
<i>i said, "what are you talking about?</i>
<i>irving never even did nudes. "</i>
they'd come in with search warrants.
<i>they took a bunch of stuff.</i>
<i>they took a lot of the photographs</i>
<i>and negatives of the models.</i>
<i>they confiscated our mail</i>
<i>and we were getting bad publicity.</i>
<i>( dramatic classical music playing )</i>
<i>( gavel bangs )</i>
male announcer: <i>repercussions</i>
<i>from the new york hearings</i>
<i>have been nationwide,</i>
<i>with contempt and perjury citations</i>
<i>indicated by the committee.</i>
bettie: <i>now there's supposed</i>
<i>to be a young boy,</i>
<i>i think he was 17 years old,</i>
<i>somewhere in florida.</i>
<i>the kefauver committee was blaming me</i>
<i>for contributing to juvenile delinquency</i>
<i>because this boy killed himself</i>
<i>looking at one of my bondage pictures.</i>
<i>what would i have to do with that?</i>
man: <i>sir, i direct</i>
<i>your attention specifically</i>
<i>to page 3 of this publication,</i>
<i>showing a young lady trussed up.</i>
<i>and ask you to look at that picture,</i>
<i>with her arms tied</i>
<i>behind her back, her mouth gagged.</i>
there is a definite connection
between this sort of thing
and his death.
bettie: <i>they made me</i>
<i>come down to the courthouse,</i>
<i>and they had me</i>
<i>sit outside the courtroom</i>
<i>while they had irving on the stand.</i>
man: <i>mr. chairman,</i>
<i>our investigation reveals</i>
<i>that mr. klaw is one of</i>
<i>the largest distributors</i>
<i>of obscene, lewd,</i>
<i>and fetish photographs</i>
<i>throughout the country by mail.</i>
i decline to answer
under the fifth amendment
of the constitution.
well, mr. klaw, i must warn you that
i'll have you cited for contempt.
do you still refuse to answer?
i decline to answer.
would that be sufficient or should i say
it all the way through, mr. kefauver?
kefauver: <i>we're not asking any quarter</i>
<i>nor giving any quarter, mr. klaw.</i>
bettie: <i>those creeps.</i>
<i>ol' kefauver and his committee.</i>
<i>i told them, "i'm not testifying</i>
<i>and lying about irving klaw. "</i>
<i>i said, "i don't care.</i>
<i>you can't force me to do it. "</i>
<i>i said, "i won't do it. "</i>
but we also went before the judge.
<i>and the judge said,</i>
<i>"you want to keep your freedom,</i>
<i>you have to destroy all the negatives. "</i>
i said that was wrong.
we have every right to do
and print whatever we like.
we're not hurting anybody.
<i>and so i was the one that was</i>
<i>in charge of chucking it away.</i>
<i>but i didn't.</i>
we did hide them,
until we were sure that the courts
would throw it out
and agree that this was not pornography.
<i>i kept the ones i know i could sell,</i>
<i>just the ones with bettie.</i>
<i>i knew one day</i>
<i>these were going to be famous.</i>
bettie: <i>she was able</i>
<i>to sneak a few of mine away</i>
<i>that they didn't know about.</i>
<i>nearly all three-fourths of his pictures</i>
<i>that he had taken</i>
<i>in his movie star photos and all,</i>
<i>they were all burned.</i>
<i>and it just ruined the poor man</i>
<i>and put him in bad health,</i>
<i>and he ended up dying.</i>
<i>i always thought, live and let live.</i>
<i>let anybody do what they want to do</i>
<i>as long as they're</i>
<i>not hurting anybody else.</i>
<i>i still feel that way.</i>
mark: <i>there was</i>
<i>a lot of people in america</i>
<i>that would have considered</i>
<i>what you were doing</i>
<i>to be nasty back in those days.</i>
<i>i never thought</i>
<i>i was doing anything wrong.</i>
<i>i never even thought there was</i>
<i>anything wrong about the bondage.</i>
<i>the only thing i regret</i>
<i>in all of my modeling experience,</i>
<i>one time three</i>
<i>camera clubs got together.</i>
<i>and they got me</i>
<i>to drinking blackberry brandy,</i>
<i>it's very tasty, you know.</i>
<i>and i must have gotten drunk,</i>
<i>the only time in my life i was drunk.</i>
<i>but i don't remember what happened,</i>
<i>i remember starting to pose for them</i>
<i>in my regular poses</i>
<i>but never open poses.</i>
<i>and there were four or five shots.</i>
<i>and i was so disappointed in it.</i>
<i>that's one of the reasons</i>
<i>i left new york,</i>
<i>was because of those pornographic</i>
<i>pictures being sold on me.</i>
<i>i was 34 in 1957,</i>
<i>and i thought</i>
<i>i was getting too old to model.</i>
<i>and that there were</i>
<i>so many pictures of me around,</i>
<i>i thought the photographers</i>
<i>were tired of shooting me.</i>
<i>and then too i'd had all that unhappy</i>
<i>experience with the kefauver committee.</i>
<i>so i just left everything.</i>
she just disappeared
and there was much mystique about her.
nobody knew beyond that,
that their was
a fascinating story about this woman,
who reached the peak of popularity
in her profession and disappeared.
over my years of research,
i heard a lot of crazy rumors.
that she was slinging hash in texas,
<i>that she had married lash larue,</i>
that she had moved to england
and married a duke.
that the mob had rubbed her out
because of a photo shoot gone bad.
that she had passed out literature
in the chicago o'hare airport
for billy graham.
that was the only one that was true.
the whole bettie page phenomenon,
which is separate
from the human being,
<i>developed while</i>
<i>she was simply off the scene,</i>
<i>and she was not really aware of it.</i>
bettie: <i>it still amazes me</i>
<i>after 40 years,</i>
<i>as popular as my pictures are now,</i>
<i>especially with young people.</i>
<i>most of the boys say</i>
<i>they learned about me</i>
<i>from their fathers' girly magazines</i>
<i>that they found in the attic,</i>
<i>or prowling through their fathers'</i>
<i>dresser drawers and things like that.</i>
<i>( bettie chuckles )</i>
<i>and they claim that i opened up</i>
<i>the sexual revolution.</i>
<i>( chuckles )</i>
robert blue: <i>the first time</i>
<i>that i ever saw bettie page</i>
in any of this material, i mean,
i immediately recognized her
<i>as someone that had the visual power</i>
<i>to provoke something inside.</i>
<i>i was thinking</i>
<i>that i was doing something</i>
<i>that was part of</i>
<i>the modernist movement of painting</i>
<i>and that was to take</i>
<i>a taboo photograph,</i>
<i>blow it up bigger than life-size</i>
<i>in a beautiful oil painting,</i>
<i>and put it in a high-end gallery.</i>
<i>bettie page really set the stage</i>
<i>for the vogue photographers</i>
<i>that came in the '7 0s and the '80s.</i>
olivia de berardinis: <i>there's never</i>
<i>been anyone like bettie before.</i>
monroe had harlow and dietrich,
she had all those blond bombshells,
but bettie,
there was nothing like bettie.
she's the first icon of her nature.
<i>and feminism has changed,</i>
so women are actually using sexuality
in a different way,
they're more accepting of it.
i would paint a few pictures
and then i would see them
appear in front of me.
<i>and the girls would start</i>
<i>showing up dressed like her.</i>
<i>either they had purple hair,</i>
but they'd have the bettie page bangs,
they'd be tattooed.
it'd be a form of bettie, but different.
<i>bettie meant something to them.</i>
so i kept painting bettie for them.
<i>the fetishistic outfits that she wore,</i>
<i>i mean, those are dreams to paint.</i>
<i>you know, the seam stockings,</i>
<i>the garter belts,</i>
<i>the snub-nosed stilettos, and that hair.</i>
<i>it's a lot of fun to paint those things.</i>
<i>her attitude, her eyes,</i>
<i>the steam that rises from them.</i>
<i>that's the most important thing to me.</i>
<i>she makes it accessible that</i>
<i>anybody can be having this fun,</i>
<i>you're not going to go to hell for it.</i>
<i>( spank slaps skin )</i>
<i>when aids came out as the huge plague,</i>
<i>and anybody who had sex could get it</i>
<i>and die this horrible death,</i>
<i>i think that people</i>
<i>really identify with bettie as fantasy</i>
<i>instead of the actual sex act,</i>
<i>so it was just a matter of survival.</i>
<i>i could see that bettie</i>
<i>was getting more popular</i>
<i>in so many other directions.</i>
<i>and dave stevens'</i>
<i>the rocketeer happened.</i>
i came across a full page photograph
of her standing in water
<i>in a little bikini that she made</i>
<i>and just was knocked out, totally.</i>
<i>i remember thinking,</i>
<i>this has got to be the most attractive,</i>
<i>she just exuded health</i>
<i>and joy and everything else</i>
<i>that's like so appealing.</i>
dave's foundation
certainly led to the betty pages.
<i>at the time, nobody</i>
<i>had reprinted a picture of bettie page</i>
<i>in two or three decades.</i>
<i>the first issue of the betty pages</i>
<i>sold out in two weeks.</i>
<i>but word filtered back immediately.</i>
<i>can you do a reprint of this?</i>
<i>it sold out instantly</i>
<i>on the newsstands, i had no idea.</i>
<i>and when i say newsstands,</i>
<i>i mean comic book stores,</i>
<i>that was my only</i>
<i>distribution outlet at the time.</i>
<i>but there was an audience waiting.</i>
<i>thank you, dave stevens.</i>
<i>the readers</i>
<i>already knew who she was.</i>
olivia: <i>then bettie</i>
<i>really became bigger</i>
<i>in the fashion world:</i>
<i>gaultier, muggler,</i>
<i>the s&m world, through madonna.</i>

olivia: <i>you just</i>
<i>couldn't get around her,</i>
<i>she was a force to be reckoned with.</i>
<i>she just became part of the culture.</i>
bob shultz and i started this club,
<i>the "bettie scouts"--</i>
<i>tongue and cheek title,</i>
kind of line boy scouts of america,
but bettie scouts of america--
'cause we spent a lot of time
going around the country
scouting for bettie page.
<i>and when we started it,</i>
<i>we did not know</i>
<i>if bettie was still alive.</i>
<i>my gut feeling was</i>
<i>she had probably passed away,</i>
<i>'cause i couldn't understand</i>
<i>how somebody could be under the radar</i>
<i>that many years, when people</i>
<i>were actively looking for her.</i>
<i>i got a call from a reporter</i>
in nashville, tennessee
named thomas goldsmith.
<i>i would give him credit</i>
<i>with finding bettie page.</i>
<i>and he said,</i>
<i>"do you know where bettie's at?"</i>
and i said,
"no, i'm just like all the rest
in the people in the country
trying to figure out
<i>what happened to bettie page. "</i>
<i>he said, "bettie page is alive.</i>
<i>and i'm gonna give you a big clue.</i>
she has a living brother in nashville."
<i>within minutes, i called jack page.</i>
<i>i said, "if i write a letter to bettie,</i>
<i>would you forward it to her?"</i>
and i wrote the letter,
i believe it was, april--
april, may, 1992.
i didn't hear anything
'til december of 1992.
and i could remember that,
that was one of
the most excited days of my life.
i went to the mailbox
and here's a letter,
<i>and it says in the corner,</i>
<i>"bettie page. "</i>
<i>she used to write everything</i>
<i>in this turquoise ink.</i>
<i>very identifiable ink.</i>
<i>it's like her trademark.</i>
<i>and she was so flattered</i>
<i>to have a fan club,</i>
<i>she couldn't believe that people</i>
<i>had any interest in her</i>
<i>after all these years.</i>
<i>for about a year,</i>
<i>we did this little relay of letters.</i>
<i>and then finally in august of 1999,</i>
my wife and i drove out to california
and met bettie face to face.
<i>we spent a lot of time</i>
<i>talking about the bible,</i>
<i>because she loved the bible.</i>
<i>and i enjoy reading the bible too,</i>
<i>so we just had a good old time.</i>
and then to think, you know,
here i'm just a guy
collecting old magazines
and kind of becomes infatuated
with this pinup girl from the '50s,
<i>and to think that this could materialize</i>
<i>to the point that i get to meet her,</i>
<i>her family, her sisters, her brothers.</i>
mark: <i>now, did your family know</i>
<i>that you were a pinup model?</i>
bettie: <i>they never said</i>
<i>a word to me about it,</i>
<i>never commented about it</i>
<i>and nether did my mother.</i>
<i>one time, i was looking in her closet</i>
<i>when she was gone to work,</i>
<i>and i found a whole big stack</i>
<i>of robert harrison's pinup magazines,</i>
<i>with my pictures marked</i>
<i>and the pages turned down in it.</i>
<i>never said a word to me,</i>
<i>one way or another about it,</i>
<i>never even mentioned it</i>
<i>and i didn't either.</i>
theakson: <i>she was living way out</i>
<i>in the fringes of los angeles,</i>
<i>you went any further,</i>
<i>there was no more humanity.</i>
<i>and she explained</i>
<i>that she'd had some difficulties</i>
<i>and that she was</i>
<i>on social security.</i>
mark: <i>now, when you walked away</i>
<i>from the modeling career,</i>
<i>you never really</i>
<i>looked back at it, did you?</i>
bettie: <i>i didn't want to be bothered.</i>
<i>i'd rather be incognito,</i>
<i>like i am nowadays.</i>
<i>( bettie chuckles )</i>
<i>after i left new york,</i>
<i>i went back to florida,</i>
<i>and i just wanted to enjoy</i>
<i>the sunshine and do something else.</i>
<i>i started up</i>
<i>with my old boyfriend armond walterson</i>
<i>that i had dated in 1954</i>
<i>when i was in florida</i>
<i>posing for bunny yeager.</i>
<i>he was going with margaret.</i>
<i>as soon as i called him up</i>
<i>he dropped margaret</i>
<i>like a hot potato</i>
<i>and started dating me.</i>
<i>every saturday night,</i>
<i>we'd go to the drive in</i>
<i>and we would sit</i>
<i>in the car and make love.</i>
<i>we didn't watch</i>
<i>the movies half the time.</i>
<i>( bettie chuckles )</i>
<i>when i met him,</i>
<i>he didn't even know how to kiss.</i>
<i>i taught him everything he knew.</i>
<i>he learned fast though.</i>
<i>two months after the wedding,</i>
<i>i realized that i made a mistake.</i>
<i>all we had in common was movies,</i>
<i>sex, and hamburgers.</i>
<i>if ever i've been stupid</i>
<i>about anything in my life</i>
<i>it's where men</i>
<i>are concerned about marriage.</i>
<i>here's what broke it all up.</i>
<i>this was the beginning</i>
<i>of new year's 1958.</i>
<i>we got into a big argument</i>
<i>because he wanted to go</i>
<i>and get drunk with his buddies,</i>
<i>and i wanted to go dancing</i>
<i>like i'd been in the habit of doing</i>
<i>on new year's eve,</i>
<i>so he left at about 20 minutes to 12.</i>
<i>and i went walking out white street.</i>
<i>and i saw a little church over there,</i>
<i>and heard music, singing.</i>
<i>it had a white neon cross</i>
<i>over the top of it.</i>
<i>and i just had to go,</i>
<i>like somebody had me by the hand,</i>
<i>i had to cross the street</i>
<i>and go in there, i'm telling you.</i>
<i>i knew it was the lord, nobody would</i>
<i>ever convince me it wasn't him.</i>
<i>i stood back there</i>
<i>and cried about all my sins.</i>
<i>i thought god disapproved</i>
<i>of me doing nudes, you know.</i>
<i>i didn't think anything</i>
<i>about the fetish and the bondage</i>
<i>for irving, but i had to do that.</i>
<i>but i thought maybe he looked down</i>
<i>on me for posing in the nude.</i>
<i>that's what i was telling</i>
<i>the pastor, and he said,</i>
<i>"have you ever done anything</i>
<i>as bad as the apostle paul?"</i>
<i>i said, "what did he do?"</i>
<i>i didn't know the bible.</i>
<i>he said, "well, he had</i>
<i>the christians murdered.</i>
<i>have you ever done</i>
<i>anything that bad?"</i>
<i>i said, "no, of course not. "</i>
<i>he said, "well, god forgave him</i>
<i>and made him</i>
<i>the greatest missionary of all time.</i>
<i>he can certainly forgive you for posing</i>
<i>in the nude, don't you think?"</i>
<i>and i received</i>
<i>the lord jesus as my savior</i>
<i>and i turned my life over to the lord,</i>
<i>and went to bible schools</i>
<i>for three years.</i>
<i>they were very strict, you know.</i>
<i>i always loved dancing.</i>
<i>i couldn't even go dancing,</i>
<i>couldn't even go to the movies.</i>
<i>the only movie</i>
<i>i was allowed to attend</i>
<i>during those three years</i>
<i>was</i> the ten commandments.
<i>i wanted to be a missionary.</i>
<i>i thought god</i>
<i>wanted me to be a missionary.</i>
<i>but you know, when i graduated</i>
<i>and i went to a mission board,</i>
<i>they would not take me</i>
<i>because i had been divorced.</i>
<i>to some christians,</i>
<i>especially the fundamentalists,</i>
<i>being divorced is worse</i>
<i>than having committed murder!</i>
<i>they got me to believe</i>
<i>that i would be out of the will of god</i>
<i>if i didn't go back</i>
<i>and lead my first husband</i>
<i>to the lord and marry him again.</i>
<i>well, i led him to the lord</i>
<i>and he prayed with me to receive jesus</i>
<i>and i thought he was sincere</i>
<i>and i married him again.</i>
<i>one month i was in his house.</i>
<i>the man would</i>
<i>not even have sex with me.</i>
<i>and i see him, i said,</i>
<i>"what's the matter, billy?"</i>
<i>he said, "well, you're filthy.</i>
<i>you've still got a venereal disease. "</i>
<i>i said, "where did you ever hear</i>
<i>anything like that?"</i>
<i>he said, "everybody knows it. "</i>
<i>i said, "everybody's a liar, i've never</i>
<i>had a venereal disease in my life. "</i>
<i>well, do you know,</i>
<i>he grabbed me by the throat,</i>
<i>i mean, he was choking me.</i>
<i>i was finally able to get his hands off</i>
<i>enough to scream out loud,</i>
<i>"billy, if you kill me,</i>
<i>god will never forgive you!"</i>
<i>he let go, and he got up</i>
<i>and went in his room.</i>
<i>the man almost choked me to death.</i>
<i>but that was the worst thing</i>
<i>that ever happened to me.</i>
<i>i almost lost my life over it.</i>
<i>i had the thing annulled right away,</i>
<i>since it was never</i>
<i>consummated sexually.</i>
<i>after i spent a year and a half</i>
<i>working on</i>
<i>a masters degree at peabody,</i>
<i>i just lacked four credits now,</i>
<i>getting the masters,</i>
<i>and i just got tired of studying.</i>
<i>so i left nashville.</i>
<i>i went back to miami</i>
<i>and i started going dancing again.</i>
<i>and one night</i>
<i>i saw this handsome fella.</i>
she didn't look like a model
of any kind, you know.
she's just a healthy looking young lady.
well, not so young,
she was in her forties,
<i>but just looked like a nice person.</i>
so i went out on the floor
and asked her to dance,
and she says, "certainly,
i'd love to dance with you."
<i>so we danced and we danced,</i>
<i>we danced all night.</i>
she was the most unpretentious person
that i have ever met.
<i>i called her the next day</i>
<i>and we were inseparable.</i>
bettie: <i>he was divorced.</i>
<i>he says, "i have two boys and a girl. "</i>
<i>i said, "two boys and a girl,</i>
<i>that's what i always wanted. "</i>
<i>well, i couldn't have children,</i>
<i>i tried for years.</i>
<i>but i was attracted</i>
<i>to harry from the word "go".</i>
<i>i just wanted to be with him</i>
<i>and to make love to him.</i>
harry: <i>i didn't know a thing about her.</i>
we went out on this pier,
and i was looking through the post cards
<i>and i saw this post card</i>
<i>and i looked at that post card,</i>
<i>and i looked over at her</i>
<i>and i looked at the card again.</i>
<i>it was bettie.</i>
bettie: <i>it says, "wow! we alligators</i>
<i>have such fun in florida. "</i>
<i>( bettie chuckles )</i>
harry: <i>she told me</i>
<i>that she modeled a lot.</i>
and she told me
she never posed nude.
<i>( harry laughs )</i>
<i>it didn't make any difference to me.</i>
<i>the people on the beach,</i>
their heads would turn and follow us,
not me of course, but they would
follow us walking along the beach.
bettie: <i>we got married</i>
<i>on valentine's day 1967</i>
<i>with his three children</i>
<i>as witnesses to the wedding.</i>
harry: <i>i had a nice new home for bettie</i>
<i>and the children,</i>
<i>everything was set up perfect, you know.</i>
<i>and then we had</i>
<i>an addition put on the house</i>
<i>with a cement roof on top,</i>
<i>and then i had a three foot wall</i>
<i>around the top of it,</i>
<i>she'd sunbathe in the nude</i>
<i>up there sometimes.</i>
bettie: <i>he was a hard worker.</i>
<i>harry was a good provider, a good lover,</i>
<i>now, he was one of the best lovers</i>
<i>i ever had in my life.</i>
<i>and he was very considerate of me,</i>
<i>always thinking</i>
<i>of my pleasure before his own.</i>
i'm not anymore,
but i was a very good lover,
and she was a very good lover.
<i>we enjoyed thrilling each other.</i>
<i>oh, by the way,</i>
<i>that leopard skin robe, you know.</i>
<i>she still had that.</i>
<i>and in the morning she'd put it on,</i>
<i>and in the evening she'd put it on.</i>
<i>it just turned me wild when i saw her</i>
<i>walking around with that thing on.</i>
<i>( mark laughing )</i>
bettie: <i>well, the children were</i>
<i>just as sweet and nice to me</i>
<i>during the months</i>
<i>that i dated harry.</i>
<i>but soon as i moved into the house,</i>
<i>everything changed.</i>
<i>his ex-wife,</i>
<i>she was so jealous of me</i>
<i>with the children,</i>
<i>and she called me up at 4:00</i>
<i>in the morning and cussed me out.</i>
<i>it was getting on my nerves,</i>
<i>i wasn't getting any sleep,</i>
<i>and i was very unhappy.</i>
<i>so i stuck it out for five years.</i>
<i>i started losing my love for harry</i>
<i>when he wouldn't make</i>
<i>those children mind me</i>
<i>or do anything i asked them to do.</i>
harry: <i>she wanted to start</i>
<i>going to church again.</i>
<i>and the whole family</i>
<i>went to church together.</i>
<i>we went sunday morning,</i>
<i>sunday night, wednesday evening.</i>
<i>i mean, it got to be like sort of</i>
<i>a fanatic thing, you know.</i>
i could see it in her eyes.
we'd go to church
and she'd blast out singing,
<i>not boisterous or anything</i>
<i>but real loud voice singing.</i>
tears came down her cheeks,
and she'd get real emotional.
<i>she was so obsessed</i>
<i>with things of the lord.</i>
why should i stop her if...
...if she wanted to go and serve god,
or the lord, or be a missionary.
bettie: <i>i got divorced</i>
<i>on january 17, 1972,</i>
<i>then i went to bible town,</i>
<i>which is 70 miles up</i>
<i>near boca raton, florida.</i>
<i>while i was up there,</i>
<i>i started imagining</i>
<i>that i was hearing somebody</i>
<i>talking to me on my tape recorder,</i>
<i>and i thought i was really listening</i>
<i>to god and the angels and the devil.</i>
<i>i lost a lot of weight then,</i>
<i>i wasn't eating</i>
<i>because they were</i>
<i>keeping me awake talking all night.</i>
<i>it had built up in my mind</i>
<i>so much that my mind snapped.</i>
harry: <i>she had caused</i>
<i>some kind of a disturbance.</i>
the police called me
and asked me
if i could come up and pick her up.
<i>i put her out there in my,</i>
<i>i think it was my bedroom,</i>
<i>and i slept</i>
<i>on the couch at the time.</i>
<i>i thought i owed it to her.</i>
<i>what would happen</i>
<i>if i kicked her out?</i>
<i>and the state of florida</i>
<i>in no way is good to mental illness.</i>
and i tried to get her going in places
and they wouldn't bother with her.
<i>she had lost it,</i>
<i>there's no doubt about it.</i>
bettie called us into the living room,
<i>me and my son larry and brad,</i>
<i>called us over</i>
<i>by this picture of jesus christ,</i>
with a knife in her hand.
she said, "if you take
your eyes off him,
<i>i'm going to cut your guts out. "</i>
whoa, you know, here i was.
<i>i could read bettie pretty good</i>
<i>and i felt safe that</i>
<i>she wasn't going to do it right then.</i>
i said, "bettie,
i've got to go to the bathroom,
i've got to relieve myself real bad."
so i went back into the bedroom,
<i>picked up the phone,</i>
<i>called the hialeah police.</i>
<i>i let the cop in the front door.</i>
<i>bettie went peacefully,</i>
<i>with a blank look on her face.</i>
bettie: <i>i ended up having</i>
<i>a nervous breakdown and hearing voices,</i>
<i>and had to go</i>
<i>to the hospital because of it.</i>
<i>they took me</i>
<i>to jackson memorial hospital.</i>
<i>they have on the fifth floor</i>
<i>a psychiatric ward.</i>
<i>i was just there two months.</i>
<i>they gave me this horrible thorazine.</i>
<i>i felt like i had sparks</i>
<i>and things going in my head,</i>
<i>and you feel like</i>
<i>you're going to die right after,</i>
<i>for an hour or two</i>
<i>after you take the thorazine.</i>
<i>but it knocked the voices</i>
<i>right out of me though.</i>
harry: <i>she was completely</i>
<i>medicated all the time.</i>
mark: <i>now, when she was</i>
<i>getting treatment,</i>
<i>do you know if they gave her</i>
<i>any shock treatment?</i>
harry: <i>i think she had two.</i>
<i>jimmy, one time he came up to the house</i>
<i>after bettie was with me awhile.</i>
he said, "i'm gonna take bettie
back to california with me,
we're gonna get a place,
we're gonna live together,
we're gonna get a house or something."
<i>california, it's a very liberal state,</i>
<i>and their mental facilities</i>
<i>are the best in the world.</i>
bettie: <i>jimmy and i were close</i>
<i>when we were growing up.</i>
<i>i didn't have any money hardly.</i>
<i>i had just enough</i>
<i>to get to california at the time.</i>
jimmy was supposed
to meet her in california,
didn't show up.
<i>that's why she got in trouble.</i>
richard w. bann: <i>she was trying to get</i>
<i>rent receipts from her landlord.</i>
<i>she was hearing voices,</i>
<i>i guess telling her to do</i>
<i>some pretty awful things.</i>
<i>and she thought</i>
<i>it was the devil speaking to her.</i>
<i>and she did tell me,</i>
"i had a knife
and i was upset with my landlady,
and i wrestled her
to the ground and i straddled her,
and i told her that i was
going to cut her up."
the lady did not die.
<i>the lady got cut</i>
<i>pretty severally on her hand.</i>
bleeding, blood everywhere.
obvious that the lady needed stitches.
<i>she was stabbed like 20 or 30 times.</i>
<i>she pleaded insanity to this charge</i>
<i>of "attempt to commit murder"</i>
<i>and this assault</i>
<i>so they then put her away for ten years.</i>
bettie: <i>you talked</i>
<i>to the psychiatrist, i think it was,</i>
<i>three times a week for half an hour.</i>
<i>and you went to groups,</i>
<i>mostly group therapy as they call it.</i>
<i>you just talked about why</i>
<i>or what caused you</i>
<i>to have your breakdown,</i>
<i>and i was put on something</i>
<i>called novane and artane.</i>
she had never hinted
about any of the trouble with the law,
any of the mental
institution years, any of that.
bettie: <i>i didn't think it was something</i>
<i>anybody would want to hear about.</i>
<i>and it was not anybody's business.</i>
<i>a lot of people still look down on you</i>
<i>if you've had a nervous breakdown.</i>
<i>they still thinking like they did</i>
<i>a hundred years ago about it.</i>
bann: <i>bettie's the one</i>
<i>that paid the price,</i>
<i>spending 9 or 10 years at patton state</i>
<i>in a horrible, horrible situation.</i>
i learned that she was
paranoid schizophrenic.
that's an enormous cross to bare.
and whereas she had her parents
<i>to thank for her amazing good looks,</i>
<i>it was a mixed blessing</i>
because her parents
were also responsible
for this genetic predisposition
towards paranoid schizophrenia,
<i>plus her mother didn't want her,</i>
<i>and her father molested her.</i>
those are heavy burdens to deal with.
<i>she was probably</i>
<i>one of the most strong willed people</i>
<i>anyone's ever going to meet.</i>
and she'd admit
that she had fallen down
but she was going to renew,
with great enthusiasm and optimism
<i>that this time she would get it right.</i>
i told her that anytime
there's anything she needs,
that there are thousands of people
who would just do anything for her
if they had the chance.
<i>the one who really did</i>
<i>the most for her was dave stevens,</i>
<i>to the point of</i>
<i>she would call him to go out</i>
<i>and bring her food</i>
<i>or take her to the doctor.</i>
stevens: <i>i took her into tower records</i>
<i>and i steered her around</i>
<i>to the book section,</i>
<i>and there on an end cap</i>
<i>of an aisle of books</i>
<i>was a display</i>
<i>of nothing but bettie page books,</i>
<i>and she just stood there</i>
<i>in amazement.</i>
<i>she gets so tickled</i>
<i>when she sees some new book</i>
with her picture on it
or some... whatever product it is,
even if she's
not getting any money for it.
bann: <i>dave knew that bettie</i>
<i>had been miss january 1955,</i>
<i>and he knew that hef</i>
<i>had never met bettie page</i>
<i>and suggested that they meet.</i>
bettie: <i>and he invited me</i>
<i>to dinner at his home,</i>
<i>the most beautiful home</i>
<i>i've ever been in in my life.</i>
<i>looks like a big castle</i>
<i>up in beverly hills.</i>
so usually at the playboy mansion,
everyone has cameras,
everything is being recorded.
but on this night,
because of bettie being so private,
so discreet, no cameras.
bettie: <i>i liked mr. hefner.</i>
<i>he was a very nice,</i>
<i>down to earth fella.</i>
<i>and he greeted us,</i>
<i>dave stevens and i,</i>
<i>in his pajamas,</i>
<i>now, a smoking jacket</i>
<i>and his purple, satin pajamas.</i>
and hef had arranged for a loan
of a 35mm print of "the rocketeer",
which was dave stevens'
creation, from disney.
and bettie had never seen the film.
she wanted to see this film
that was an homage
to her, inspired by her.
♪ <i>you're a sweet little headache</i> ♪
♪ <i>but you are lots of fun</i> ♪
♪ <i>i've a good mind to spank you...</i> ♪
there was an unauthorized film
made in 2005 called
"the notorious bettie page".
this is quite an elegant knot,
because the more the subject pulls
the tighter the knot becomes.
she didn't like the word
"notorious" in the title.
and do you approve?
i believe in jesus.
well, of course you do, my dear.
of course you do.
bann: <i>but all of a sudden,</i>
<i>here's what you heard</i>
from the back
of the screening room.
"lies, lies, lies!
l-i-e-s, lies!
why don't you tell the truth?"
( woman gasps )
hefner: <i>when she resurfaced</i>
<i>here in california,</i>
<i>she was not being</i>
<i>properly represented by anybody,</i>
and a lot of people were exploiting her
and taking advantage of her.
and i was able to put her in the hands
of more appropriate business people,
legal people,
so that she had
the right kind of representation
and somebody to look after her
and take care of her.
and we've been very close ever since.
and i had a call
from mr. hefner, who asked me
if i would help out a friend of his
<i>and try to see</i>
<i>that anything that was done</i>
<i>with bettie's name and likeness</i>
<i>ultimately had her approval on it</i>
<i>and of course she would receive</i>
<i>some type of compensation for it.</i>
bettie: <i>i made more money</i>
<i>in very recent years</i>
<i>than i ever made during the seven years</i>
<i>i was modeling back in the '50s.</i>
bettie was able to enjoy life more
because of what she could do
in the later part of her life.
( people chattering )
i think she had an incredible charm.
she had an incredible aura,
or how you say it, charisma.
and i think a lot of models
learned from her.
there's nothing
intimidating about bettie.
women can appreciate her,
men can appreciate her.
most of them, you don't
really remember the the person,
<i>but her, you know, you say,</i>
<i>"oh yeah, that's bettie page. "</i>
she's also has had
the keen sense of timing
to know exactly when
not to appear, which is hard.
man #1 : go ahead, bettie.
bettie: <i>hello every one of you.</i>
- <i>( crowd oohs )</i>
- hi, bettie.
bettie: <i>thank you very much.</i>
<i>gee, sounds like a big mob.</i>
man #1 : <i>it is a big mob.</i>
man #2: <i>bettie, you have thrown the</i>
<i>coolest opening in soho that i've seen.</i>
bettie: <i>i hope you like my book,</i>
<i>i'm very pleased with it.</i>
woman: <i>and we're just all super fans</i>
<i>of yours, and we all wanted to say</i>
<i>congratulations,</i>
<i>and three cheers to bettie page.</i>
( cheering and applause )
when i realized it was really big
is when i got the first bettie scouts
of america fan letter from china.
<i>i mean, it's literally</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>
new zealand, australia, all over europe.
<i>she's very very popular in japan.</i>
<i>very popular in england,</i>
<i>france and germany.</i>
chantal thomass: <i>always i had been</i>
<i>inspired by bettie page,</i>
and then the pinups
from the '50s and bettie is the one,
the most extreme and most special one.
chantal thomass (in french):
<i>bettie page was way ahead of her time...</i>
<i>she influenced</i>
<i>[theiry mugler, gauliter].</i>
<i>i mean, she did it with humor,</i>
<i>and i'll always work</i>
<i>on my design in lingerie with humor.</i>
<i>i mean, it has to be sexy,</i>
<i>but it must have</i>
<i>a small part of humor.</i>
<i>bettie page can be</i>
<i>an example for women</i>
<i>to be beautiful, fun, sexy,</i>
<i>and why not, intelligent.</i>
lisa, we got
another postcard from your father.
wish you were her.

bann: <i>it's a tribute to her.</i>
<i>these heartbreaking good looks,</i>
<i>the riveting appeal of her personality,</i>
<i>still to this day</i>
<i>inspires the kind of response</i>
<i>that you get from artists,</i>
fashion designers,
and the fandom,
which we know is incredible.
the bettie page they love is very real.
in other words, i think that
she had this kind of amoral attitude
<i>towards sexuality and nudity,</i>
<i>and even, you know, the bondage things.</i>
she did not disgrace those
who looked more sternly
upon portraits of sexuality.
i think she handled
her phases of life with dignity.
the suggestion back then
that sex was simply a natural,
normal part of life
was very revolutionary,
and helped to change
the values of our time.
<i>i think that in that context</i>
<i>bettie page is truly iconic.</i>
<i>if you think the images</i>
<i>are wonderful, you have no idea.</i>
<i>she's a wonderful human being.</i>
bettie: <i>i never thought of myself</i>
<i>as anything special or important.</i>
<i>i was just doing my job</i>
<i>and enjoyed ever bit of it.</i>
<i>( bettie laughs )</i>
<i>and i'm so thankful</i>
<i>that you like my pictures</i>
<i>and that you care as much</i>
<i>as you do about me,</i>
<i>and i wish you all the best,</i>
<i>every one of you.</i>

i didn't hardly recognize her voice,

i guess in the years your voice changes,
'cause she's got
like a hoarseness to her voice.
but the same bettie.
love her, she sounds so great.
