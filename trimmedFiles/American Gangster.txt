bumpy! we love you!
there you go, darling.
over here! over here!
frank! come on!
come here.
this is the problem.
this is what's wrong with america.
it's gotten so big,
you just can't find your way.
the grocery store
on the corner is now a supermarket.
the candy store is a mcdonald's.
and this place,
a super-fucking discount store.
where's the pride of ownership, huh?
where's the personal service?
you see what i mean? shit.
i mean, what right do they have,
of cutting out the suppliers,
pushing out all the middlemen,
buying direct from the manufacturer?
sony this, toshiba that.
all them chinks
putting americans out of work.
that's the way it is now.
you all right?
you can't find the heart of anything
to stick the knife.
hey!
anybody here?
can i help you?
call an ambulance.
forget it, frank.
there's no one in charge.
call an ambulance!
some say
bumpy johnson was a great man,
according to the eulogies, a giving man,
a man of the people.
no one chose to use in their remembrances
the word most often associated with
ellsworth "bumpy" johnson, "gangster,"
whose passing has brought a who's who
of mourners on this chilly afternoon.
lucchese mob boss dominic cattano,
harlem crime figure nicky barnes.
nicky! nicky!
from the political arena,
the governor has come down,
the mayor of new york,
and chief of police and commissioner,
sports and entertainment luminaries:
bumpy johnson,
age 62 when he passed,
was a folk hero among
harlem locals for over four decades:
regarded by some
as the robin hood of harlem,
by others as a ruthless criminal:::
i don't understand, you know.
i would've thought that bumpy would
put out a better spread, you know?
-you want something?
-no, thanks.
i want chicken wings at my funeral.
all right, nicky barnes.
who is that?
he didn't know what hit him,
you know what i'm saying?
i just kept popping him
in the face 'cause that's what i do.
mmm.
i don't have a lighter. you have a light?
oh.
okay?
that's very good.
hey, frank.
go get me a light while you're at it.
appreciate it.
don cattano.
hey, how you doing, rossi?
good.
would you like a drink, sir?
give him a scotch on the rocks.
come on. come on.
i know you're hurting, frank.
so am i.
i'm all right.
-you gonna be all right?
-yeah.
i'm sure bumpy didn't say
anything to you, but he made me promise
that if anything ever happened to him,
that i should make sure
that you want for nothing.
i appreciate that.
you know, half the people in this room
owed bumpy money when he died.
they think i'm gonna forget to collect,
but i'm gonna get that money.
well, that's the spirit. go get 'em.
mr roberts,
taking the prosecution's side,
mr roberts,
taking the prosecution's side,
give us us v: mead,
subject, issues, what the determination was
and what it means to us today.
class, you'll be critiquing mr roberts,
so pay attention.
i hate hearing my name called,
you know?
it means i gotta get up in front of the class,
i gotta turn around,
and i know every one of those people there,
they know more than i do.
the number one fear of people,
it ain't dying, it's public speaking.
i get physically ill, i wanna throw up.
and that's what you wanna do for a living.
no, i don't wanna be like that, man,
i wanna beat it.
so, should i do this?
no, he'll take it from me, he knows me.
i've known him since high school.
-from high school?
-good morning. yeah.
he doesn't take it, just throw it in.
it's good service.
-throw it in? all right.
-yeah.

asshole!
campizl: i swear to god, richie,
i didn't know it was you.
i would never slam a door
on your hand, knowingly.
you bit my fucking hand.
what are you doing
serving subpoenas, anyway?
we're on loan to county.
-county?
-how's that working out for you?
hey, fuck you.
hey, i'm sorry. consider me served.
can we leave it there?
assault on a police officer? i don't think so.
hey, for old times' sake. what can we do?
what do you want? what can i give you?
what do you get for assault
with a deadly weapon, jay?
-five years minimum.
five years.
guys, come on. no, guys.
what do you want? who do you want?
who do you got?
you want big al's bookie? you want
his accountant? i'll give him to you.
campizl: stop, stop, stop.

campizl: this is... i'd rather not.

so, where are they?
i just called, man.
i called and walked back here
and 10 seconds has gone by.
i saw him with the slips, jay.
you saw policy slips? you saw
grocery bags. you don't know what's in 'em.
yes, i do and so do you.
don't give me that bull.
what's the rush, richie?
half an hour, the warrant will be here.

-guess you're gonna miss it.

-you sure?
yeah, i'm sure. let's go.

wbz, honey bunch,
the show they all love!
it's the groovy sound
of the jefferson kaye saturday night show:
dig, honey, it's coming up time for news:
jumping on the ceiling,
wallpaper peeling on wbz:
stick around, the jace-man's got 10:
back in 10:
it's not just a couple of bucks, all right?
it's the same thing in principle.
oh, are we talking principles?
richie, a cop who turns
in this kind of money, says one thing.
he turns in cops who take money.
we'll be fucking pariahs.
yeah, well, then we're fucked both ways.
not if we keep it. only if we don't,
then you're right, we're fucked.
but not if we keep it.
god damn it, man! did we ask for this?
did we put a gun to someone's head
and say, "give us your money"?
cops kill cops they can't trust.
we can't turn it in, man.
can you believe that?
how much is it?
$987,000.
well, what happened to the rest of it?
what the hell are you doing
counting it out here in front of everybody?
are you nuts?
get it back in the bags, seal them up
and down into the property room.
you fucking boy scout.
what? what?
detective trupo, sign here.
you guys ready to make
a lot of fucking money?
always.
hell, yeah.
fucking a.
oh, look at this.
there you go.
all right, look at this.
fucking beautiful.
there's three more boats.
hey, don't lose any of that shit.
i know.
all right, be careful.
hey! just enough for the reagent test.
a little less.
rossl: this is the french connection dope:
kilos of the same dope
eddie egan and sonny grosso took from us:
the cops seize it, arrest everyone,
then they start taking it out
of the evidence room,
whacking it down to nothing
and selling it back to us:
they basically control the market with it:
mr rossi, i have a surprise for you.
rossl: they've been doing it for years now:
they live off it, our dope:
what do you think?
what the fuck is happening
to the world, frank?
those fucking crooks.
yeah. sad about bumpy.
things are never gonna
be the same in harlem.
you walk down the street, nobody bothers
you 'cause bumpy was making sure of it.
half a key.
how is your day now?
it's chaos. every gorilla for hisself.
motherfucker!
who can live like that?
there has to be order.
that would never happen with italians.
more important than any one man's life,
is order.
frank.
hey. come on in, claude. sit down.
how y'all doing, huh?
-good.
so, you see nate over there? yeah?
yeah, all the time.
-nate is everywhere. he's good.
-yeah.
-he's still over there?
-yeah. he's got himself a club now.
-okay. whereabouts, saigon?
bangkok.
-bangkok?
-i don't think he's ever coming home.
come on.
on the house, for our boys in uniform.
thank you, sugar. that's very kind.
thank frank.
thanks, frank.
just relax.
you have to boot this shit a couple of times.
the cops keep cutting it, selling the shit.
i don't want to say anything,
'cause the price is right,
but that shit in nam is way,
way heavy.
did you ain't seen the jar, frank?
i think you walked right past it.
the money jar, frank.
what do i gotta do, put a fucking sign on it?
hmm?
look at this nigger right here.
you know, frank,
bumpy don't own 116th no more.
bumpy don't own
no real estate in harlem right now.
i'm the landlord and the lease is 20%.
look, don't sell dope then, frank.
get a real job.
you need a fucking job, frank?
hmm? is that what you need?
well, you can come work for me.
okay? you can drive me around, huh?
you can open my doors.
huh? "yes, sir", "no, sir", "right away, sir",
"anything you want, massa johnson".
twenty percent.
twenty percent is my profit, tango.
if i give you that, then what do i got left?
nothing, man.
twenty percent puts me out of business,
and every somebody
you know out of business.
there's legitimate ways of doing things,
tango, and then there's this way.
not even bumpy took 20%.
bumpy's fucking dead.
my man.
twenty percent?
twenty percent.
doc, let's go.
out: good job: sit:
a leader, like a shepherd,
he sends his fastest nimble sheep,
out front:
and the others will follow.
while the shepherd,
he walks quietly behind it.
here, boy! here we go. right here.
bring it here. yeah.
now he's got the stick, and the cane,
he'll use it!
if he has to.
but most times he doesn't have to.
he moves the whole herd quietly.
what right do they have
cutting out the supplier?
the middleman. buying direct.
putting americans out of work.
that's the way it is now, frank.
that's the way it is.
the drug problem
in vietnam is more than marijuana:
at this point, it is estimated that one third
of american troops are experimenting
with opium and heroin:
the authorities say
they have confiscated
large quantities of marijuana,
heroin and pills:
every person and every vehicle
going through the gates
is subject to a thorough shakedown:
soldiers have access to
the drugs at many rest and relaxation spots
in bangkok, saigon and other areas
throughout vietnam and thailand:
officials say the easy availability,
relatively cheap cost
and high purity of heroin
throughout saigon and the far east,
is leading to an epidemic
of heroin addiction among us soldiers:
-operator:
yeah, international.
-what city?
-bangkok.
-you know the country code?
-yeah, 376.
-for the first three minutes, it'll be:::
-i got it, i got it. i got it.

-your sister's? in vegas?
-yeah.

what am i supposed to do with him,

to be here?
oh, come on, girl.
how much you want, frank?
tell him i want 100 keys.
frank, ain't nobody i know
can get you that much personally, all right?
you're gonna have to
piece it together from several sources,
and it's not gonna be 100% pure.
i don't want that.
i know what you don't want, frank,
but look, what you're gonna need is to get
to the chiu-chou syndicate, all right?
cholon, saigon.
if they're gonna deal with you at all.
i understand that,
but by then it's gonna be too late.
it'll be already chopped up.
i wanna go get it where they go get it from.
i wanna go to the source.
-so, you're gonna go get it yourself?
-why not?
huh? i came this far.
you're gonna go
into the motherfucking jungle?
i'm in the jungle. look around.
they're eating these roaches
and whatever that is.
nigga, i'm talking about snakes, all right?
i'm talking about tigers,
i'm talking about vietcong,
i'm talking about mosquitoes
that'll fucking kill your ass.
you wanna go into the jungle?
we're going.
-fuck it. let's go.
-we're going.
why not? let's go.
hey, frank.
this whole spot's locked down
by the kuomintang,
general chiang kai-shek's defeated army.
how would you get it into the states?
you ain't got to worry about that.
who do you work for in there?
you ain't got to worry about that, either.
who are you, really?
frank lucas,
says it right there in my passport.
i mean, who you represent?
me.
you think you're going
to take 100 kilos of heroin into the us,
and you don't work for anyone?
someone is going to allow that?
that's right.
after this first purchase,
if you are not killed by marseille importers,
or their people in the states, then what?
then there will be more,
much more, i guarantee it.
and if it's all the same to you,
i don't wanna have to drag my ass up here
no more.
of course not.
my man.
-soul brother, huh?
-soul brother.

and the pilot and the boys on the other end.
give them a hundred.
fifty is gonna cover it, frank.
give them a hundred,
give them the whole thing. here.
and look,
that's all i got.
so, if that dope don't arrive for any reason...
hey, listen, cousin or no cousin,
i'm a busy man, all right?
i ain't got no time
to be going to nobody's funeral.
i'll let you know when it's in the air.

-you murdered a guy!
-i earned it getting shot at!
you murdered a guy!
you murdered him, you robbed his money,
then you called me to get you out of it.
that makes me an accessory
after the fact, motherfucker.
i'll tell you the facts, man. just write
the report the way i say it happened,
and then that's the way it is,
and that's how it will be.
i can't do that.
i'm a leper because i listened to you
and turned in a million bucks.
no one will work with me after that.
i can get off this shit, richie. that's easy.
just write the report between us,
as partners.
i can't do that.
hey!
stop! stop!
fuck it.
open the trunk.
peace now! peace now! peace now!
lbj, how many kids did you kill today?
get out, get out, get out of vietnam!
get out, get out, get out of vietnam!

and that the best way
to stop it is for the united states
to simply pack up
and get out of vietnam right now:

america's public enemy number one
in the united states is drug abuse:
in order to fight and defeat this enemy,
it is necessary to wage a new,
all-out offensive:
federal authorities
have announced their intention
to establish special narcotics bureaus
in washington, new york,
los ángeles, chicago:::
a detective without
the support of his fellow detectives
really can't do much.
you know why i don't have it.
doesn't matter. you did what you had to do.
greatest city in the world!
and it's turning into an open sewer.
everybody's stealing, dealing.
look at you.
you can't work because you did your job.
good news is,
you're not the only honest cop in town.
the special narcotics bureau
in washington is not a dog and pony show.
they are sincere. i know this
because they want us to orchestrate it.
and i want you to
head up things here on our end.
if it's federal,
who do i answer to, the post office?
no, you answer to me,
me and the us attorney, nobody else.
you never step foot
in a police station again.
you work out of your own place,
you pick your own guys,
guys that you know
would not take a nickel off the sidewalk.
well, we got the lovely transit.
now, look at that. can't you just feel it?
i think it's lovely.
watch your step.
look at these beautiful floors.
at least, i don't know, 200 years old.
and it's hard to get the cracks...
now this was one of my favourite rooms but
we had some problems with the plumbing.
i even fixed it. i know it works.
it's not gonna leak.
here it is.
you know, i used to be a really good
piano player when i was a kid,
but then, i don't know why i forgot.
life goes on. well...
how long are you gonna be?
oh, and do me a favour, please.
mind the doors.
those are beautiful, ornate glass doors,
you know.
here we go, jimmy. come on.
oh, yeah. give it back.
huey's.
huey: what up, boy?
yeah, who this?
who you think it is, boy?
-frank:
-frank who?
-frank your brother, negro:
-frank?
that's right.
hey, melvin! melvin, where's ma?
-what?
-frank's on the phone!
hey, ma!
-how are you doing, frankie?
frank's on the phone!
-say what?
-mama, frank's on the phone!
frank? oh, my lord!
yeah, when?
well, you just say it, man, yeah.
listen, i'm gonna call y'all back
at 6:00. i want you to get
everybody together, all right?
get mama, get everybody.
-all right?
-okay.
hey, frank!
what's happening, frank?
-hey, frankie.
-how you doing, uncle frank?
get out the car.
get the kids, get the kids.
look at this, baby.
oh, my lord!
i'm so glad to see you, boy.
oh, i'm telling you,
this is some piece of land you got here!
i wonder what
the poor people are doing here?
and whose house is that,
frankie?
that is your house, mama.
-mine?
-that's yours.
and who else?
now, there, that's my room
right there, man. right over there.
anybody want some more collard greens?
i wanna tell you how happy
i am to see all my children at the table
and the grandchildren at the same time.
my heart's so happy.
-enjoy yourselves.
-right on, grandma.
i hope you got a job, boy,
the way you're eating over here.
that boy right there, he got a arm on him.
i mean, a major league arm.
oh, yeah?
ain't that right?
right on, pop.
well, we'll see after dinner.
we'll see him throw it around a little bit.
no, no, you can't catch him, man.
i'm talking about... i'm talking about...
this guy throw harder than gibson.
we're talking 95 miles an hour.
-can you catch him?
-he gonna...
he gonna catch the ground.
we might've played catch,
i think, when i was about five years old.
since then, he ain't been able to keep up.
-this is your room.
-it's perfect.
oh. why, it's...
will you look at this?
oh!
it's beautiful. it's beautiful. it's just...
i...
how did you...
i had it made.
from memory.
you were five when they took it away on me.
-that's right.
-how could you remember it?
how could i forget, mama?
i'll just tell you it is perfect.
it's all perfect.
i can't tell you how much i love you.
i love you, too, mama.
it's okay.
both these guys,
good with wires, they got solid informants,
and they're honest and they're fearless.
they're insane, richie, like you.
where are they?
that's jones with the skinny white broad.
best i ever seen on the street.
he knows dope, but he's together, all right?
he's a stand-up guy all round.
and that's abruzzo
with the two fat black ones.
he loves a big ass, man.
he's a bulldog. he don't fuck around,
all right. he's got a bit of a temper,
yeah, but you can trust
this guy with your grandmother.
listen, richie. we work together.
you want me, you gotta take them, too.
when do we start?
the man i worked for,
he had one of the biggest companies
in new york city.
he ran it for more than 50 years.
fifteen years, eight months and nine days,
i was with him every day. i worked for him,
i protected him,
i looked after him, i learnt from him.
bumpy was rich,
but he wasn't white man rich, you see?
he wasn't wealthy.
he didn't own his own company.
he thought he did, but he didn't,
he just managed it.
the white man owned it, so they owned him.
-nobody owns me, though.
-hey.
-how you doing, babe?
-good.
that's 'cause i own my own company,
and my company sells a product
that's better than the competition,
at a price that's lower than the competition.
well, what are we selling here, frank?
how you doing, red?
these are my brothers,
just got here from north carolina.
everybody, this is redtop.
-hello.
-how you doing?
and the ladies.
hey.
what wrong? y'all niggas
ain't never seen hoochie before?
why are they all naked?
so they can't steal nothing.
right.
the most important thing in business
is honesty, integrity, hard work,
family,
never forgetting where we came from.
thank you, charlene.
see, you are what you are in this world,
that's either one of two things.
either you're somebody,
or you're nobody. be right back.
i need these fresh. 'cause
if i have to come back here and get you,
-you know what it is.
tango.
-don't y'all play that.
yes, sir, i hear you.
you won't have to come back.
there won't be no problem.
what about you, frank?
you need anything?
where's my money?
redtop gave you the package.
you're supposed to be
handing me my money.
here's a jar right here. twenty percent.
-you got the jar?
-that's right.
get the fuck out of here...
what you gonna do?
what the fuck you gonna do, frank?
huh? what you doing?
you gonna shoot me in front of everybody?
huh? come on.
shit.
there you go. twenty percent.
so, what was i saying?
jones.
jonesy.
that was nice, man.
-just doing my melodious thing, baby.
-got you.
this is the newly formed
essex county narcotics squad.
our mandate is to make major arrests.
no street guys.
we're looking for
the suppliers and the distributors.
heroin, cocaine, amphetamines.
no grass under 1,000 pounds.
no powder under 40 kilograms.
any less than that,
then somebody else can waste their time.
we gonna be handling the big shipments,
the big money and the big temptation.
i heard a story about you.
that you found a million dollars
in unmarked cash
and gave that shit back. is that true?
yeah, i did.
anybody got a problem with that?
so do i, you know?
i think about it every day.
i should be down in south florida
with a 68-foot cruiser doing fishing charters.
you and me, both.
but you know, i didn't, so here i am,
and we'll be looking to land
other kind of sharks.
-all right?
bingo.
see that, richie?
-yeah.
and this stuff is your everyday stuff.
but this blue magic, twice the potency.
i mean, it's the purest thing i ever seen
in the streets. it's strong enough to smoke.
and that's for those white suburban kids
who are scared of needles.
i paid 10 bucks for that.
and it's everywhere.
i mean, it's on every corner out there.
so, how is that possible?
who can afford to sell
shit twice as good for half as much?
hey, man. frankie, baby, good to see you!
everything's good?
yeah, man, just got back from europe,
over there for two months,
south of france, man.
look right, look right.

you're making too much noise. look at me.
the loudest one in the room is
the weakest one in the room. i told you that.
all right? what,

what's your problem with nicky, man?

i ain't got no problem with nicky.
oh, you like nicky?
-yeah!
-you want to be like nicky?

blue magic, it's coming out of new york.
what do you expect me to do, ignore it?
the cab driver has filed aggravated assault
and grand theft charges
which he may reconsider
depending on how much
the state of new jersey offers to settle.
i showed him my id. i told him i was a cop.
you stole his cab
and you knock him out.
i was chasing the twenty grand, all right?
next time, knock him out
before you show him your badge.
look, i don't want to hear
about you going into new york again.
-well, then this investigation's over.
-you're not listening to me.
i said, "i don't want to hear
about you going into new york again."
you do whatever you have to do.
you go wherever you have to go
to figure out
who's bringing this shit into the country.
just don't tell me about it.

no, that's...
he was just as important
as martin luther king to me.
what did he do?
did a lot of things. he was a friend
and served new york. new york served him.
he was my boss.
my teacher.
what did he teach you?
he taught me a lot of things. he
taught me how to take my time.

do something, to do it with care, with love.
anything else?
he taught me to be a gentleman.
that's what you are?
that's what i try to be. come here.
come here. sit right here.

i took it very seriously.
i know. i know and i appreciate that.
and i said yes,
i would take on this responsibility.
take care of your son,
if god forbid, something happened to you.
joe, the kind of things
she's saying to child social services
made me look really bad, all right.

old friends like you, yeah.
uncle joey, watch me, okay?
okay, i understand.

you know, there's something else
i was gonna ask you.
-something else.

simple simon-ass motherfuckers.
the whole place was imported.
brick by brick.
gloucestershire.
-who?
-great britain.
yours.
here you go.
pull!
come, eva.
i'm sure you're dying
to see the rest of the house.
of course. excuse me.
thank you for a wonderful lunch.
it was delicious.
what do you think of monopolies?
you mean like the game?
no, i just think monopolies
were made illegal in the country, frank,
'cause nobody wants to compete, you know.
nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.
i mean, you let the dairy farmers do that,
half of them would be
out of business tomorrow.
just trying to make a living.
that's your right, i mean,
it's everyone's right. it's america.
we just can't do it
at the unreasonable expense of others.
'cause then it becomes un-american.
that's why the price
we pay for that gallon of milk
could never represent
the true cost of production
'cause it's got to be controlled.
it's gotta be set. it's gotta be fair.
gotta be controlled by who?
i set a price that i think is fair.
-i don't think it's fair.
-you don't?
-i don't think it's fair.
-i think it's fair.
i mean, i know
your customers are happy, frank,
bunch of fucking junkies that they are.
but we fellow dairy farmers out here, frank,
are you thinking of us?
you thinking of them?
-the dairy farmers?
-yeah.
i'm thinking of them, dominic, about
as much as they've ever thought about me.
i'm just thinking out loud now.
if you took some of your inventory, frank,
and you sold it wholesale...
sit.
we could work.
we could do some distribution.
i don't know. i'm pretty good, dominic.
you know, i got 110th, 155th, river to river.
i'm all right.
that's kind of a mom and pop store
next to what i'm talking about.
i mean, let's go at least bigger than kmart.
i'm talking about la, chicago, detroit,
las vegas. let's go nationwide, huh?
i'm gonna guarantee you your peace
of mind here. you don't want that?
you're going to need it.
i don't know how you view me, you know.
i'm kind of a renaissance man, frank.
you know,
the people i deal with on a daily basis,
you know, they're not enlightened, frank.
you talk to them about civil rights,
they don't know, you know.
they're not open to change.
not from the way things
are done and who's doing it.
i talk to them,
there's just no misunderstandings.
and that's what i mean
by your peace of mind.
you're paying, what, $75,000, $80,000 a kilo?
i'm a renaissance man, too.
i'll consider $50,000.
why would you trust these people?
and the way they look at you...
they look at me like
it's christmas and i'm santa claus.
they look at us like we're the help.
they work for me now.
i predict that
when i meet joe frazier,

how'd he get so fucking close to the ring?
the heavyweight champion of the world,
joe frazier!
hey, frank.
you gonna keep that hat on all night?
i'm gonna miss the fight.
you paid for it.
joe, over here!
this guy, he's a supplier
at most: or just a pimp:
otherwise we'd know his name:
his tickets were phenomenal.
better seats than dominic cattano. right?
joe louis shook his hand.
who the fuck is this guy?
what's this?
that's the plate off the limo.
check with the company who rented it.
right there, mr lucas. right there. good.
can i get a shot here, frank? right here.
looking good, frank.
beautiful.
right on, frank!
congratulations!
she's the most beautiful bride
i've ever seen.
that's my sunshine right there, mr williams.
i wish bumpy had met her.
throw it to me!
get a picture.
come here, baby.
-what's happening?
sit tight.
congratulations, frank.
detective.
so, you sure you done the right thing?
i mean, she's a beautiful girl and all...
hey, hey, listen, listen.
before you say anything
about me or about my wife,
understand this is the most important day
of my life, detective.
oh, i understand. i understand.
you know, a man who
walks around in a $50,000 chinchilla coat
and never even bought me a cup of coffee.
there's something wrong there.
pay your bills, frank?
i don't know what you're talking about.
do you pay your bills, i asked you?
if you're not getting your share,
maybe you need
to talk to the chief of police.
what's my share?
'cause you don't even fucking know me.
maybe i'm special.
you are special.
you see that right there?
special investigations unit.
special.
get it?
ten grand. first of each month.
deliver it right here.
-are you done?
-oh, yeah, i'm done.
don't forget your card.
have a nice fucking honeymoon.
let's go.
his name is frank lucas:
originally from greensboro, north carolina:
a couple of arrests years ago.
gambling and unlicensed firearm.
for 15 years, he was bumpy johnson's
driver, bodyguard and collector.
he was with him when he died.
he's got five brothers.
he's the oldest. and a lot of cousins.
they all living up here now,
spread throughout the five boroughs
and jersey.
the brothers are dexter,
-in brooklyn: he's a dry cleaner:
-what can i do for you?
-i'm picking up.
yeah:
melvin in queens has got
a custom furniture and fire doors business:
-that's it right here?
-right there.
terrence in newark,
he has a hardware store:
turner in the bronx has got a tyre shop:
and huey lucas in bergen county
has a body shop:
-is your manager here?
-that's my price.
oh, man, i'm gonna take it
somewhere else, all right?
these businesses are
the distribution and collection points
for frank's dope and frank's money:
everything about frank's life seems
unpretentious, orderly and legitimate.
he starts early, gets up at 5:00 a: m:
has breakfast in a diner
in harlem every morning, usually by himself:
then he starts work:
takes a meeting with the accountant
or with his lawyer:
at nights, he usually stays at home:
and if he does go out,
it's to one of two clubs or
a handful of restaurants with his new wife:
-some ball players:
-that's fucking wilt chamberlain.
friends, musicians:
never, never with organised crime guys:
sundays, he takes his mother to church:
then he drives out and he changes
the flowers on bumpy's grave.
every sunday, no matter what.
not the typical day
in the life of a dope man, richie:
no:
bumpy johnson's life wasn't typical either,
and he ran harlem for years:
so you're saying
that frank lucas replaced bumpy johnson?
yeah:
his driver?
yeah:
sounds a little farfetched:
but is it? is it?
because everything he does:::
he's handing out turkeys, man.
:: he does the same as
bumpy would have done, right?
and who was bumpy most likely to teach?
the guy he sees every day.
it's like a sicilian family:
he's structured his organisation
to protect him in the same way.
and if he was with bumpy for so long,
that means he would have
spent a lot of time with italians.
definitely long enough to learn that much.
but here's the thing. i don't think
it's frank lucas that we're after.
who we want is whoever frank lucas
is working for.
it's whoever's actually
bringing the heroin in.
okay. so what do you have on him
that will stick in court? because this isn't it.
without powder, without informants,
no one's going to jail.
that's understood, sir.
and i don't think we're gonna
get informants, not from inside the family,
and i don't think we're gonna
get informants, not from inside the family,
you know, unless we get very, very lucky.
straight up lab tests suggesting
purity's consistent with asian dope.
the italians, we know,
usually work with other europeans
or with the turks.
we got small blue packets turning up in
neighbourhoods all over the tri-state area.
from chinatown, to harlem,
washington heights
richmond avenue and staten island.
they got north orange, princeton, bayonne,
newark,
syracuse, rochester, buffalo,
and all the way through connecticut.
the same dope.
that's it, down there.
and it's three counts
as they round the turn for home now:
okay, let's all join hands.
lord, we thank you for this
food we're about to receive,
the nourishments of our bodies.
feed our souls with heavenly grace,
in jesus' name and for his sake.
-amen.
amen.
shh. shh.
hey, it's okay. it's okay. come on, now.
it's okay.
-you better get yourself ready, old man.
-come on, big man. throw the ball.
get yourself ready, old man. all right!
come on, now. your pop said
you had an arm on you. come on!
i'm gonna set your ass
in the grass, uncle melvin.
hey! watch your mouth, boy.
throw the ball!
damn, uncle melvin,
i'm a pitcher, not an outfielder!
steve. steve, come here.
come, sit down.
uncle frank. what's happening?
how you doing?
cool.
you want a drink?
you know better than that.
just checking.
why didn't you show up
for that meeting, steve?
i set it up with the yankees and billy martin.
why didn't you show up?
don't lie to me.
i don't want to play ball no more.
-i decided.
-what you talking about?
you decided? decided what?
-that ain't what i want.
-what you talking about?
you've been playing
since you was a little boy.
you were ready to go into the pros.
what you...
frank! we got a problem, man.
what do you want?
i want what you got, uncle frank.
i want to be you.
he's been diluting it so much.
we're down 2%, 3% pure.
and you tested it? you're sure?
yeah.
fuck you looking at?
my man.
-welcome, frank.
-how you doing, nick?
it's all great. welcome.
-i need to talk to you.
-great. come on.
hey, you all, everybody get out! let's go.
come on! hurry up!
sit, my brother.
i take it you talked to charlie.
guess you wanna hear more
about my black coalition.
-let me explain to you...
-no, no, no.
i'm all right.
that's not what i came here for, nick.
yeah, everybody's good, nick.
you know, everybody's happy.
charlie, baz, the italians,
you know, johnny law.
everybody's happy except you.
-i'm happy, frank.
-you happy? really?
well, maybe i'm the one with the problem.
yeah, go on. get one.
all right.
i gotta problem 'cause
i don't understand why you gotta take
something that's perfectly good
and mess it up.
see, brand names.
brand names mean something. understand?
shut the fuck up!
go ahead, frank.
i'm sorry about that bullshit.
blue magic.
that's a brand name.
like pepsi, that's a brand name.
i stand behind it. i guarantee it.
they know that, even if they don't know me
any more than
they know the chairman of general mills.
what the fuck are you talking about, frank?
what i'm talking about is
when you chop my dope down
to one, two, three, four, five percent
and then you call it blue magic,
that is trademark infringement.
you understand what i'm saying?
with all due respect, frank,
if i buy something, i own it.
no, that ain't true. that ain't true.
if i buy a car, and i wanna paint it,
i can paint the motherfucker.
yeah, but you don't have to.
this is what i'm saying to you, nick, you
don't have to. good enough the way it is.
you can make enough money off it
the way it is, just by calling it blue magic.
anything more than that is greed, son.
what you want, frank?
you want me to change the name on it?
i would have to insist
that you change the name.
fine by me, frank. i'll call it red magic,
even though that don't sound as good.
i don't give a fuck what you call it.
put a chokehold on the motherfucker
and call it blue dog shit,
you know what i mean?
i don't care, just don't let me catch you
doing this again.
catch me? infringement? insist?
i don't like these words as much as,
"please, thank you,
i'm sorry to bother you, nicky."
these are better words you use to come
to my motherfucking club
without an invitation! you hear me?
my man.
oh, shit. fuck, is that the cops there, man?
it's all right.
the hell they're gonna do, give us a ticket?
stuff's in the car, frank.
what?
some of it's in the trunk.
-how you doing, frank?
-i'm good. how you doing, detective?
how was your thanksgiving?
not so good, as a matter of fact.
why don't you get out of the car?
come on, give me the fucking keys.
-where's the shelby at?
-the shelby's gone, frank.
-the shelby's gone?
-stay right there.
yes, sir. right here.
you got anything
worth looking at in here?
hey, that's that trupo guy.
is that him?
yeah.
fucking prick.
-come over here a minute, frank.
-yeah.
what are we gonna do about this?
we don't do shit about it.
we close it up, throw it back in the trunk,
everybody go home,
have some pumpkin pie, warm apple cider.
i got a better idea.
or would you rather me throw you
and your brother in the fucking river?
would you rather your house
blows up next time?
-i loved that car.
-i know.
what's he doing? shakedown!
somebody's getting some money
for the benevolent fund.
look at that shit.
sorry, frank.
it's all right. go and get in the car.
all right, you call me back.
ins, irs, fbi.
i can't get a damn thing out of any of them.
because they all think you're on the take.
and you think they are.
you know,
i don't think they want this to stop.
i think it employs too many people.
judges, lawyers, cops, politicians,
prison guards, probation officers.
they stop bringing dope into this country,
about 100,000 people
are going to be out of a job.
spearman.
fbi. here to see detective roberts.
so who took it out? somebody i know?
my wife?
come on, if somebody's taking a contract
out on my life, i'd like to know.
i can't say without compromising
our source. you understand?
no. not when it's my life,
i don't understand.
-if you want we can assign someone to you.
-fbi protection.
you know what? my life
is dangerous enough as it is.
well, we'll let you get back
to your business.
okay. larry, bob.
thanks for visiting the garden state.
take care.
hey, what do you know
about frank lucas?
we know that you keep calling about him.
we believe that peace is at hand:
we believe that an agreement
is within sight:
as i said earlier:::
yeah.
hey, joey. hi.
all right. yeah, tomorrow. why?
what the fuck is a microwave?
it's a scientific force,
like atomic energy.
-yeah?
yeah.
it rearranges the molecules.
of what?
of what? of popcorn.
of your head. stick it in. go on.
i can get you one of those.
brand new, just like this.
i'll have it delivered.
no, thank you.
hey. where is that?
aspen. we just got back.
had a great time. you know who we met?
who?
burt reynolds.
-yeah? yeah?
-yeah. i'm not kidding.
a lot people from hollywood go up
there now. they're buying up everything.
-this is your place?
-mmm.
you know what that's worth?
ski in, ski out. five bedrooms.
sauna. everything. we were guests.
it's your place.
isn't there something we can do,
about leaving the big guy alone?
you know who i mean.
i don't report what you just said,
i can get in a lot of trouble.
i do report it, then the trouble is yours.
i'm hoping you won't do that.
richie, come on. i'm not taping it.
how do you know? because we're friends.
and i'm telling you, this is a real offer.
from who? your uncle?
why would you do this?
why would you risk our friendship?
because
i care what happens to you.
you shouldn't have done this.
i had to, i had no choice.
neither do you. richie!
you don't have a choice.
just leave frank lucas alone.
frank lucas?
yeah.
you tell marie i had to leave. i'm sorry.
tell her why.
-talk! talk!
-don't shoot! don't shoot! don't shoot!
-are you richie roberts?
-yes, so what?
you've been served. i'm sorry.
all right.
laurie.
look, i'm sorry i never gave you
the kind of life you wanted, all right.
i'm sorry it was never enough.
don't punish me for being honest.
don't take my boy away.
what are you saying?
that because you were honest
and you didn't take money
like every other cop, i left you?
no, you don't take money for one reason.
to buy being dishonest
about everything else.
and that's worse than taking money
nobody gives a shit about.
drug money, gambling money
nobody's gonna miss.
you know, i'd rather you took it
and been honest with me.
or don't take it. i don't care.
but then don't go cheat on me.
don't cheat on your kid
by never being around.
don't go out and get laid by your snitches
and your secretaries and strippers!
i can tell by just looking, she's one of them.
you...
you think you're going to heaven
because you're honest, but you're not.
you're going to the same hell
as the crooked cops you can't stand.
all rise.
please be seated.
miss dickerson,
before the court renders its opinion,
is there anything else
you'd like to be heard on?
yes, your honour.
your honour, a lot has been said here today
about how unsavoury
mr roberts' environment is for a child.
how dangerous it is.
we tell him to protect us.
we give him that responsibility,
but then say, "oh, we don't trust you
to raise a child.
"we don't think you're fit for that."
i'm not.
you're right.
being around me is no place for a kid.
you take him to vegas.
i'll come see him when i can.
your honour, i want to apologise
for wasting the court's time.
doc.
i see them.
there he is.
the fuck is this guy doing?
hey!
-champagne.
merry christmas, detectives.
-for us?
yeah. enjoy that.
-you fellas have a good time.
-mmm-hmm.
it's cristal.
south vietnamese troops
called in air strikes
on communist positions inside the city:
paying off johnny law, that's one thing.
there ain't no problem with that.
i've been paying off the police
since i was 10 years old.
put more of their kids through college
than the national merit award.
give me one of them round one... yeah.
this is different, though. these...
special investigative unit. that's
their problem. they think they're special.
fucking crooks. no code of ethics.
what do you think?
looks great. it's beautiful.
good.
the police, that ain't the only somebody
i'm worried about.
i seeing cars where i ain't never seen them
before, people i don't know.
yeah, me, too.
ho, ho, ho.
-merry christmas, charlie.
-thank you.
-merry christmas, charlie.
-thank you.
-i love you.
-i love you, too.
here, take this.
a quick toast, and then i'll be off.
what happened here was an
accident of war: somebody made a mistake:
bumpy ain't hardly ever go out no more.
after a certain point he stayed in the house.
watch tv.
play chess. read the newspaper.
i thought he was just trying to lead the
quiet life, but no, he couldn't go nowhere.
-not without something happening.
-frankie...
-we can still go out.
-with who? where?
-well, with...
-but i know he's under surveillance.
ain't gonna be no christmas time
with my family being here no more.
why don't you just pay
who you have to pay?
i do pay them. i pay thousands and millions
to dope dealers, crooks, cops.
i pay everybody.
i pay more than they should get.
i can't satisfy nobody!
it's like dope! everybody's strung out!
the more you give 'em, the more they want.
they expect more.
give more and they want more.
do you want to go out?
all right, baby.
put something of what you got.
-should i?
-yeah.
that's christmas spirit.
that's what i'm talking about. feliz navidad:
-something nice?
-mmm-hmm.
we're going to have a great time.

i want to wait in the car.
frank, i got it. i got it. i'll wait for it. i got it.
-get that yellow sauce.
-yellow sauce.

-yeah.

let's go.

we'll go right now and fucking kill him
whether it was him or not,
you say the word, frankie.
we got to do something, frank.
we can't just sit here.
we're leaving.
-all right, everybody get out.
you all right, man?
go on home. it's christmas time.
go and be with your families.
i'm all right.
go on. go ahead. be with your kids.

where are we gonna go, huh?
we're gonna go to spain, somewhere?
china?
huh? come on, sit down.
tell me where you want to go.
frank, we can go anywhere we want.
-no, we can't.
-we can live anywhere, frank.

frank lucas don't run from nobody, baby.
we ain't going nowhere.
we're gonna stay right here.
we're gonna stay right here.
this is my home.
this is where my business is,
my wife, my mother, my family.
my country. i ain't going nowhere.
i ain't running from nobody!
this is america.
and you ain't going nowhere, either!
huh?
a ceasefire, internationally supervised,
will begin at 7:00 p: m: this saturday,
january 27th, washington time:
will begin at 7:00 p: m: this saturday,
january 27th, washington time:
i'll call you back.
hey! what are you doing?
richie.
wow.
so, what i hear it was the corsican mob
took a shot at frank.
you know, french connection,
fernando rey,
the exporters that frank
has put out of business.
look, i can take care of him in new york.
i just don't want to have
to worry that every time
he drives across the bridge to jersey,
someone's gonna take another shot at him.
richie, you and i gotta
start working together.
we need to step up our efforts.
next time, their aim could be better.
we need to keep this cash cow alive.
what the fuck are you doing here?
whoa!
were you actually gonna arrest
frank lucas?
what's the matter with you?
-what, you don't know?
-no.
everybody in new jersey's crazy.
you know what we do here?
cops arrest bad guys.
before you get on that bridge again,
you should call me first,
just make sure it's safe.
"i'm more enlightened
than some of my friends.
"i can guarantee you peace of mind."
that's what you told me, dominic.
"i can guarantee you peace of mind!"
i don't feel so peaceful!
huh?
they tried to kill my wife!
who was that? huh?
maybe it was one of your peoples.
-i don't know yet. no.
-you don't know?
you don't know.
i'll tell you what i know.
maybe i should just put 500 guns
out there on the street
and just start shooting up some people,
just to make a point.
frank, it was a junkie. it was a rival.
some dumb-ass kid
trying to make a name for himself.
somebody you forgot to pay off.
someone you slighted
without even realising it.
could be someone you put out of business
from being so successful. look at you.
success, it's got enemies, frank.
lots of enemies.
so your success took a shot at you.
what are you gonna do now?
how you gonna kill it?
you're gonna become unsuccessful?
frank, we can be successful
and have enemies, right?
or we can be unsuccessful, too, you know,
we can have friends.
that's the choice we make.
the final evacuation of military
and diplomatic personnel
continued throughout the night,
as north vietnamese troops
marched on saigon:
the imminent fall of the city has brought
chaos and a growing sense of desperation:
-operator:
-yeah, bangkok, 367, international.
one moment, please:
yeah, nate:
hey, frank. what's up, baby?
what's going on over there?
it's all over:
yeah, i'm watching the news.
what the hell's going on?
the game's over, frank:
-huh?
-it's done.
everybody going home, baby.
give peace a chance.
well, look, i'm not::: listen to me:
i want two...
i want 2,000 keys in the air.
it's impossible, frank:
all our resources are going home: it's over:
i'll tell you what. i'm on my way over there.
-right now? oh, come:::
-yeah.
you stole my shit?
-spearman, wake the fuck up, man.
-what?
where's my shit, darlynn?
don't hurt me, jimmy!
jesus! what the... police!
police!
drop the gun, jimmy!
drop the gun!
let me see your hands!
jimmy, drop the fucking gun!
i'm not playing with you, jimmy!
i'll blast your fucking head off!
don't shoot! don't shoot!
i got your gun and i got your prints.
you know what you got?
you got attempted murder.
fifteen fucking years!
attempted murder is the
same as murder one, that's a grand jury.
now, a grand jury could
come back favourably.
it could be reduced to manslaughter.
all right? maybe even self-defence.
it all just depends
on how we wanna deal with you.
see where this is fucking going, jimmy?
let's say you beat it.
what you think your cousin frank
is gonna think?
right, he is gonna know,
at some point in time,
we sat you down,
and we talked to you like this.
and then you go to court
and you beat attempted murder?
what's he gonna think?
is he stupid? is your cousin frank stupid?
answer him!
no. he's going to assume that you talked.
but right now, frank doesn't know.
you want frank to read
about this in the papers?
or do you just want to walk out of here?
no bail, no trial, no jail,
just walk out of here today:
your choice:
opium plants are hard enough
to outlive any war.
they'll still be here
long after the troops have gone.
what are you going to do for transportation
when the last us plane goes home?
i'll figure something out.
you will see me again, that's for sure.
it is not in my best interest
to say this, frank,
but quitting while you're ahead
is not the same as quitting.
-yeah.
-hey:
go get him.
-whatever you want to do, baby.
-one second.
-it's frank.
-yeah.
yeah.
newark.
short term,
parking lot three.

that's the mustang we talking about, right?
okay, right. what's the plate number?
-k-a...

:: 760:
::: 76:
zero: all right:
there's no short term lot three at newark.
-they got letters. a-b-c-d.
-i know.
maybe he means a time. 3:00?
this isn't no jersey licence plate,
nor new york, for that matter.
-k-a-7-6-0?
-yep.
kilo alpha?
a plane tail number?
kilo alpha 760.
you check commercial planes.
you guys check private planes.
everything, from a little fucking cessna
to the biggest fucking whatever jet.
all right?
i'll check military planes.
where you going, jimmy?
you're not going anywhere. sit... sit down.
-captain?
-yeah?
richie roberts. essex county.
i know you're expecting us.
here's our warrant.
we're looking on the plane.
wait! wait!
scotty, stop all these soldiers!
check their bags. every one of them.
no-knock warrant.
-all right. start upstairs.
-where are they going?
step in, sweetie.
ma'am, please sit down.
what is this?
whoa, whoa, whoa!
all this stops! hey. hey. hey.
nothing leaves this area, all right?
just slow down with this.
-all right. stop these trucks.
hold on, hold on.
everything off the walls!
just pull it all down.
damn thing's a monster, rich.
what is this?
nothing leaves this area
till we've checked it.
all right, captain. nothing.
we got to take the plane down,
we got to look in the trucks.
every man here gets searched.
read the warrant, sir.
your husband's illustrious career is over.
the feds are gonna come in,
gonna take everything.
and then they're gonna take it all.
but not before i get my gratuity.
so where's the money?
what are you talking about? what money?
what am i talking about? what money?
the getaway money that frank and
every other gangster keeps in his house.
if you leave now,
there's a chance frank might not kill you.
shut up! sit down!
sit down!
defence today
announced the planned evacuation
of all remaining us
combat forces from vietnam,
news that comes too late for some,
as here, on a solemn tarmac
at dover air force base:
this c-130,
loaded down with its sorrowful cargo,
a cargo of america's bravest and best,
en route to their final resting places:
you guys. take this coffin down.
-open it.
-i'm not doing that.
great fucking dog, huh?
you stop this, right now.
my warrant gives me permission
to examine this plane,
the plane and its cargo.
well, you don't have my permission.
i don't need it, captain.
easy! easy, boy. come on. hey! easy!
frank, move out of the way.
damn.
that's enough!
stay with these coffins.
do not let them out of your sight.
got it. okay.
hey. help me out with this.
that was a military transport plane.
if there was heroin onboard,
then someone in the military
would have to be involved.
which means that even as it fights a war
that's claimed 50,000 american lives,
the military is smuggling narcotics.
that is how this event today
will be interpreted.
that someone employed by this office
believes that the united states army
is in the drug trafficking business
and is trying to prove it
by desecrating the remains of young men
who have given their lives
in the defence of democracy!
-there is dope on that plane.
-shut the fuck up!
is it any wonder, then,
because of your actions,
the entire federal narcotics programme
is now in jeopardy
of being dismantled as completely
and enthusiastically
as that fucking transport plane?
that is what you've accomplished,
mr roberts, single-handedly.
i had good information.
that the target of my investigation
was bringing dope in on that plane.
-and that target is?
-frank lucas.
-who?
-his name's frank lucas.
who is frank lucas?
who does he work for? which family?
he's not italian. he's black.
is that supposed to be some kind of a joke?
you're this close to the end of your career
in law enforcement
and you're making fucking jokes?
my investigation indicates
that frank lucas is above the mafia
in the dope business.
my investigations also indicate
that frank lucas buys direct
from a source in southeast asia.
he cuts out the middlemen
and uses us military planes
and personnel to transport
pure number 4 heroin into the united states
and he's been doing so
on a regular basis since 1969.
i have cases against
every member of frank's organisation.
frank's organisation?
no fucking nigger has ever accomplished
what the american mafia hasn't in 100 years!
and you would know that how? why?
'cause your head is stuck up
your fucking ass?
hey, lou, do me a favour.
will you get this fucking kike out of here?
kike? kike?
richie, no.
hey, richie!
make it stick.
spearman's with the coffins.
they're about a quarter mile away.
doctor.
what?
fucking trupo came by the house, man.
it's bad.
frankie, i need to speak with you a minute.
please?
-i got to go, ma.
-no, sit down just a minute.
would you please come back a little later?
thank you.
-ma, i got to go. all right?
-just a few words.
listen to me. i got...
please, sit down. just a few words.
i've been thinking about some things.
you know, if you'd been a preacher,
your brothers would have been preachers.
right.
if you'd been a soldier, they'd be soldiers.
you know that.
they came here because of you.
you called and they came running.
right.
that's because they look up to you.
they always expect you
to know what's best.
but even they know
you don't shoot cops.
even i know that.
-eva knows it.
-all right, ma.
the only one who doesn't seem to know
is you!
all right, ma. i got to go.
i promise you, i ain't gonna shoot nobody.
i never asked you where all this came from
because i didn't want to hear you lie.
i didn't want you to worry about it.
now, come on, i got to go.
don't lie to me!
don't do that.
do you want to make things so bad
for your family that they'll leave you?
because they will.
they'll understand.
she will leave you.
all right, mama.
i will leave you!
got coffins on the move, richie.
we want the transport coffins,
not the ceremonial ones.
who are these guys?
what does it say?

bayonne cleaning services?
bayonne? what the fuck is that?

...dead servicemen returning
from defending our country in vietnam...
over there. okay.
ladies and gentlemen,
at this stage of the proceedings
the counsels are ready
for their opening statements.
for the prosecution,
mr roberts will proceed
with his opening statement first.
mr roberts, are you ready to proceed?
yes, your honour.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
the state will show and you will hear
that frank lucas is the most dangerous man
walking the streets of our city.
all right, y'all, get on out.
let me talk to mr richie alone.
come on, come on, come on.
i pay y'all by the hour, not by the minute.
thank you.
you ain't wearing a wire, are you?
no.
all right. i was talking to my lawyers.
they said something to me,
i can't believe it.
did you really find a million dollars
in the trunk of a car
-and then turn it in? did you do that?
-yeah.
you did that for real, huh?
my man. good for you. shit.
you know johnny law got it though, right?
-maybe.
-ain't no maybe about it, mr richie.
you know he got it.
you turned that money in,
he took it and you ain't get nothing for it.
did you?
why did you do that?
-it was the right thing to do.
-that's true.
that's a good answer.
it was the right thing to do.
the question i have,
the question i've been asking myself is,
would you do it again?
i mean, that's a lot of money,
that's a long time ago.
many car payments ago,
many child support payments ago.
so i said to myself,
the onlyest way to find out is to find out.
bribery, extortion, murder,
racketeering...
now, you give me an address,
i'll make sure the car's there,
i'll make sure that money's in that trunk.
no, thanks.
you sure?
come on, now, richie.
what do you think, that impresses me?
you think that you're better than them?
you ain't no better than them other cops.
in fact, you're the same as them.
you are them.
let me ask you this.
do you really think that
putting me behind bars
is going to change anything
on them streets?
them dope fiends is gonna shoot it,
they're gonna steal for it,
they're gonna die for it.
putting me in or out
ain't gonna change one thing.
then that's the way it is.
that's just the way it is.
so what we got, richie?
we got me and you sitting here.
we got that little snitch-ass driver
for my brother:
you got a little bit of powder:
you're going to need more than that, richie:
i got possession, supply,
conspiracy,
bribing a law officer: i got people who'll
attest to seeing you kill in cold blood:
i got your offshore bank accounts,
your real estate, your businesses,
all bought with money from heroin.
and i got hundreds of parents of dead kids.
addicts who od'ed on your product.
and that's my story for the jury.
and that's how i make it all stick.
"this man murdered thousands of people.
"and he did it from a penthouse,
driving a lincoln."
aside from that,
you got nothing to worry about.
that's pretty good. but that's why
we go to court, isn't it, richie?
'cause i got witnesses, too.
i got celebrities.
i got sports figures. i got harlem, richie.
i took care of harlem, so harlem's
gonna take care of me. you can believe that.
-i got more than that, frank.
-what you got?
i've got a line of people
wanting to testify against you,
it stretches out the door
and around the block.
you damaged a lot of lives, frank:
i got the mazzano crime family:
remember those boys?
you put them out of business:
i ain't got nothing to do with no mazzanos.
mazzanos ain't got nothing to do with me.
-they got everything to do with you.
-what, they...
-you know why?
-why?
because apart from the fact
that they hate you personally,
they hate what you represent.
-i don't represent nothing but frank lucas.
-you sure?
a black businessman like you?
you represent progress.
the kind of progress
that's going to see them lose a lot of money.
with you out of the way,
everything can return to normal.
my man.
you know what normal is to me, richie?
i ain't seen normal since i was six years old.
normal is seeing the police
right up to my house
dragging my little 12-year-old cousin out,
tying him to a pole,
shoving a shotgun in his mouth
so hard they bust his teeth.
then they bust two shotgun shells
in his head and knock his fucking head off.
that's what normal is to me.
i didn't give a fuck about no police then.
i don't give a fuck about
no police now. shit.
you know what,
you can do whatever you want to do.
so, it don't mean nothing to me
for you to show up tomorrow morning
with your head blown off.
do you understand what i'm saying?
yeah, frank. get in line.
that one stretches around the block, too.
all right.
what do you want to do?
you know what you got to do.
what do you want me to do? snitch, huh?
i know you don't want me
to give up no cops.
what do you want? you want gangsters?
pick one. jew gangsters?
mick gangsters? guineas?
they've been bleeding harlem dry
since they got off the boat, richie.
i don't give a fuck about no crime figures.
you can have them.
i'll take them, too.
you'll take them, too?
no, you didn't. you're talking about police.
you want police?
you want your own kind?
they're not my kind.
they're in business with you, frank.
they ain't my kind.
they ain't my kind
like the italians are not yours. all right?
huh.
what can you promise me, richie?
i can promise you, you lie about one name,
you'll never get out of prison.
you lie about one dollar,
in one offshore account,
you'll never get out of prison.
now you can live life rich in jail
for the rest of your born days,
or be poor outside for some of them.
that's what i can promise you.
i want them cops, richie.
that's what i want, i want them cops
that took that money out of my pockets.
him, too.
all right. okay.
hey, spearman? spearman.
so these guys are all connected up
to gywnn, all right.

four police officers were arrested today
on charges of taking bribes
from drug traffickers:

have led to the arrest of
more new york city detectives:
convicted of extortion,
members of new york city's
special investigations narcotics unit
will face sentencing today in federal court:
macnamara. vendazzo.
trupo.
you are special.

-caffe latte. yeah.
-latte?
-oh, shit. yeah.
-you all right?
that's a fancy way of saying
coffee with milk.
-yeah.
-$2.50.
so you been talking to your brothers?
no, no, i ain't talked to them in years.
it's probably best for them.
what the hell am i going to do out here,
richie? i don't know how i'm gonna live.
hey, i told ya, i ain't gonna let you starve,
all right?
obviously, you ain't starving.
bagels and blinches. they will catch up
with you, you know?
who's this?
expensive sneakers. about $100 a pair.
frederick douglass boulevard.
this used to be eighth avenue, why do they
call it frederick douglass boulevard now?
this was me richie, right here.
this was all me.
in my day there were so many niggers
out here buying dope
you could've made a tarzan movie.
you know, one phone call, i'll be right back
in business, you know that.
you don't do that, frank.
these days i keep all my promises.
why'd you come and get me, huh?
you're a superstar, frank.
a superstar?
your evidence alone
gave me 150 convictions.
thought the least we could do
is give you a ride home.
yeah, you sure did that.
you gave me a ride home. free ride.
coming to gangsters.
what?
ain't nothin', man. ain't nothin', man.
that's life right there. that's life right there.
even a fool gets to be young once.
