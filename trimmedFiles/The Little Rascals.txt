parked it right there!
was here...
- so where is he?
boy, you just mistakes!
so far, fearful parrot! i want to
have a club that you give out!
you know, dirty and slippery ball?
if would be a club, i would resign!
why do not you go reconcile
with him, alfalfa?
you friends when you were a year.
- he started it!
and you should finish it. you
are a team, as bert and ernie,
superman and clark kent,
millie and vanilla.

problem is that rules are rules.
but hatred for women is
the most important thing?
i mean, can not be a
club we like something?
yes, but without a box,
we can not have a club.
hey, you have burned a box, not the club.
