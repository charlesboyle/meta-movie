elianna the powerful...
sorceress, shifter.
running for her life through a forest she's
never seen until this moment in time.
assassins - nameless and without mercy.
soldiers of fortune,
mercenaries, hit men.
history is rife
with bastards like these.
you've been bested.
elianna the
powerful - sorceress, shifter.
running through a forest
in a world she's never seen,
moving against time itself...
to save my life.
and who am i?
all right.
my name is granger.
these nice gentlemen-
they're after my money.
they're not gonna get it.
there's more where that came
from if you want to keep going.
jesus, glenn, chill out!
the guy's trying to help us!
why'd you go after his nuts like that?
you're right! you're right!
i lost my head a little, major.
i'm sorry, man.
yeah, all's fair in a real fight.
but i'm retired.
help him up.
you all right?
hey, look, sir.
kick to the balls aside,
we really do appreciate you doing
these off-hours for the boys.
you boys are all improving.
and i'm willing to keep it up
as long as you keep feeding the gi fund.
double for you.
all right?
come on. don't be shy.
that's good. some of the kids
can't afford their own uniforms.
you know, one day, one of us
is gonna put you down.
not very likely, captain.
yeah, you're probably
right about that.
good night, sir.
good night, captain.
wanna grab a beer?
all right, kids.
line up.
come on. on the mat.
good. take your position.
good. all right.
we'll see you next week, okay?
have a good night now.
be careful, all right?
get your shoes.
another year.
another 365, guys.
and i couldn't tell you
where the time has gone.
wish i could trade places with you.
to the team.
until next year.
where the hell are
you people coming from?
the passage is open.
the prophecy...
we have but seconds.
the prophecy-
it's all that there is.
you gotta be kidding me.
the king's sorcerer.
we have work to do-
posthaste.
we must not be caught outside
the fortress walls in darkness.
the king requests your presence.
get him up.
open the gate!
close the gate.
close the gate!
i know you can't be here...
alive.
quite right.
i have passed from this world.
remember who you're meant to be.
remember that you must
return to this place.
it was my prophecy to die for you.
it is your destiny...
to be here.
from what i've heard,
you've had quite an adventure.
the king!
you will stand when the king enters.
well, that's not cool.
indeed, it is warm.
i mean, it's...
hardly sanitary.
it is blood, not feces.
the blood of a champion.
the blood of the chosen one!
for the record, it was your...
it was your men-
actually your man...
who did this.
my soldiers were to ensure
that you were not taken...
by the dark one
at the enchanted place.
dark one?
the fellow who followed you
through from the time beyond.
see, one has mere seconds to follow
the enchanted through the blue fire.
had the dark one hesitated,
he would have been
cut in half by its energy.
or left in your world.
instead, he chose to pass
through with you...
and our beloved elianna.
god rest her soul.
all leave save the king's guard.
so, what do people call you
in your time?
granger.
granger?
that is a most unusual name.
well, you'd be surprised
how many times it'd get me laid.
"laid"? what is "laid"?
oh, you mean to lay with a woman?
you will curb your common tongue
in the presence of the king.
it is inconsequential, allard.
we're all the same man
underneath our cloth.
right, granger?
yeah. and what's your name?
other than "the king"?
insolence!
now you're starting
to seriously piss me off!
all right, silence!
there is darkness enough beyond...
without casting stones from within.
take your men, allard.
i wish to speak with
granger in confidence.
aye, my lord.
my noble and trusted guard.
he's a piece of work.
i am afraid...
that i might spend the rest of
my days trying to decipher...
your strange manner
of speech, granger.
and to answer your question,
i was once known as raven.
raven?
from the hunter bird, yes.
now you're, uh, the king?
well, that is a story
for many, many glasses of ale.
i see that you still
harbor disbelief...
on how you've come to be in our time.
yeah, you could say that.
we live in a time of powerful sorcery,
when men, or objects,
may be imbued
with wondrous capabilities.
elianna worked tirelessly to open
the gates between our worlds.
she believed as i do.
she gave her life to find you...
and bring you to our time.
our kingdom, our very existence,
is threatened from without.
you have been brought here,
as the prophecy has decreed.
with all respect
to your beliefs and...
and her sacrifice, i...
i think you got the wrong guy.
selflessness is a trait
common amongst the uncommon.
our journey...
has just begun, granger.
escort our guest to his quarters...
and make sure that the
doctor attends to his wound.
aye, my lord.
come.
why have i been brought here?
at sunrise we shall speak at length.
but rest deep,
granger, for tomorrow...
our adventure begins.
rest deep.
i do not share my king's
devotion to the prophecy,
yet i pledged to honor the crown.
that is why you've not been
hung by the town gallows...
for that reason and that reason alone.
well, that's good to know.
when the time comes-
and the time is nigh...
i shall be the one to draw
my blade across your skin.
well, when the time comes,
we'll see what we see.
but until then,
be a good royal bitch
and show me my room.
i began my day with a protein shake,
and now i'm standing
in a medieval sleeping hut.
acid trips don't get this weird.
or maybe they do.
i wouldn't know.
no water purification to speak of.
geez, there's got to be
everything from e. coli...
to dead sheep
floating around in this stuff.
when in rome.
en garde!
now it's you and me, knave.
sorry.
they must have put me
in the wrong hut.
excellent hardware though.
it is my honor to share your bed.
well, look, there must have
been some kind of mistake.
i'm, uh, just a visitor here.
from the time beyond, yes.
i am honored to share your bed.
oh, you know about that?
as it is written, so shall it pass.
you are the chosen one.
look, um...
will you cover up for a second?
i shall mentally keep the time.
look, i don't really need you
in my bed tonight.
but it is my honor.
i'm a little tired to have
a woman share my bed.
wait. would you
prefer a man?
i can have the guards summon a man.
no, no, no, no.
no men. no.
look, i'm tired
and i need to sleep, okay?
then i will keep your bed
with you for warmth.
for warmth? okay.
if that is all you wish from me.
i suppose tomorrow is another day.
as it is written.
hey, do you happen to know anything...
about that prophecy
everybody's talking about?
if i had any information
and betrayed its meaning,
i would be put to death immediately.
oh. okay.
well, i suppose
that it can wait till...
a wound on his head and his arm.
he will lay with me for warmth,
but not for pleasure.
nor does he require the use of a man.
tired... and straight.
yeah, well, so what are you,
doc, the, uh...
what are you, like
the full-service job, doc?
like, medieval crack and patch, huh?
we both agree this is
a little awkward, right?
a physician for his majesty's royal
court cannot indulge her pride.
keep him limber.
i just want you to know that...
as tired as i am, this is really nice.
but it is my honor.
there is to be a fountain
of blood in your days ahead.
you mustn't sleep any longer.
awaken now.
danger is at hand.
what do you mean?
it is your fear that weakens you.
awaken now!
abomination!
my wound is fatal.
why?
why'd you do this?
he said the holy mother
has thus decreed.
it is not for my understanding.
they will retrieve
this empty shell alone.
- who are you?
- be clear...
i do not ask your forgiveness.
a simple wench.
the gods have been merciful.
the king will need to speak with you.
leave us.
my lord, the dark ones pursue him.
it would be unwise to leave him...
leave us.
my lord.
you are alive.
that is fortuitous.
you could have just sent champagne.
a wench.
like a thief in the night did she
intend to rob you of your life.
my most gifted soldier
would likely have perished.
well, i guess lady luck's
just on my side.
blasphemy!
your life is whole...
because the prophecy
decrees it to be such.
i'm sick of everybody riffing
about that prophecy...
about fate, destiny.
you can take that prophecy
and shove it up your ass!
never have i been spoken to
in such a manner.
i find your insolence
oddly refreshing, granger.
our finest wine! my lord!
we have much to discuss, granger.
you're not gonna rethink
the wine and have me...
dragged around by horses, are you?
were you in contempt, granger.
were you in contempt.
our finest grape.
away.
the throne became mine
after a period of war.
even from the time beyond you must
understand that after chaos comes stability.
and after stability follows chaos.
yes.
even as men of god, we are unable
to cease killing ourselves.
our previous king,
a commoner who rose to the
throne, was a great man.
the people sang his praise,
and the kingdom knew
only prosperity in his time.
he was loved by all.
until?
until the dark ones rose.
the king and his followers
fought valiantly but succumbed.
it was only by divine will
that we managed...
to drive them from
our gates and survive.
well, not to be overly
critical, but your, uh...
fortress is somewhat rustic.
we retreated to this
fortress out of desperation.
the dark ones carried
a plague in their blood,
and our walls were breached.
well, who are the dark ones exactly?
their origins are unknown.
they live in the mountains and
follow the word of their prophet.
the holy mother.
yes.
they follow her word with a
reverence of that of a god.
well, who is she, then?
some say that she is a sorceress
of the black arts.
that her followers spill
their blood on her command.
and others say she demands
of her legions...
to eat one another.
cannibalism?
i do not know this word.
it's to eat human flesh.
yes.
yes, to partake in that
would be unholy.
the meat of a human has become
intoxicating for these savages,
and it is now their way.
there's something wrong about this.
what about me?
why do i matter to them?
and why have they targeted
your kingdom?
because, granger, we are
simply in their midst.
and you matter because
you are the chosen one.
"chosen"? what does that mean?
chosen to do what?
chosen to kill their holy mother.
well, maybe this is just
mental exhaustion talking,
or maybe i'm just sick of people
chasing me down trying to kill me,
but...
tell me where to find
this crazy bitch.
yes.
chickens, my lord.
fantastic.
the king!
on your feet.
i know. i know.
you shall feast like a king...
and fight like the god of war himself.
pray you will remember which cloak
falls first upon your shoulders.
i appreciate this effort, but
i- i don't need all this stuff.
i only need my knife.
you will lower your blade.
i'm just making-
lower your blade.
i'm making a point here.
i don't need an arsenal.
i move much quicker with my knife.
and if you want me to get
into this holy mother's camp,
it sure as hell won't be with a bag of chickens.
haven't you people
ever heard of salmonella?
you have no need to carry additional
weapons or food supplies.
exactly my point.
allard and his men shall carry them.
our doctor shall accompany
you and tend to your wounds.
you shall not be alone
in your quest, dear granger.
that's what i was afraid of.
sons of whores.
i'm unarmed. stand down.
i have no personal quarrel with you.
well, i'm glad to hear it.
would you mind?
may i?
thank you very much.
i have acted hastily.
i shall take my leave.
just for the record, i don't want you
to come tomorrow any more than you do.
it is the king's wish that i secure your
health on this quest, and it shall be done.
well, lets face it.
it's not like you have a trauma team...
to stand by to stitch an arm back on.
in the time beyond, you
can re-affix a man's arm?
if the conditions are right.
this information pleases me.
you must tell me more tales about
your practices from the time beyond.
we'll speak... at night
while we make camp.
so you're coming?
even though you don't want to.
the king has decreed it,
and it shall be done.
but you're not happy about it.
no!
not in the slightest am i content
with my lot in this cursed life!
i will take my leave.
very smooth, my man.
look, i'm sorry. i didn't...
if we shall perish anon,
i will not die unfulfilled.
unfulfilled?
oh, right.
our coupling was imprudent.
i was... rash and only
desired to satisfy my urges.
well, did you?
i pray you will
tell no one of our union.
i will take my leave.
no one.
i'll tell no one. no one will know.
mom's gonna love you.
he and he alone.
do not fail me, thane.
royal affairs.
you have been summoned.
of course.
it's been, what, an hour?
i don't suppose you're gonna tell me
why he wants to see me this time.
it is not the king for whom
you have been summoned.
it is the seer.
oh, "the seer."
aye.
should i ask?
it is the king's wish that you listen to the
seer's words and form none of your own.
why?
best you leave the chicken-fingered
wretch to her games in her tree.
no questions? you will hear her
words and stay your tongue.
and if i don't?
then i shall take your tongue.
allard, do you date a lot?
i mean, do people actually
like hanging out with you?
i mean, female people.
or are you into that whole, uh,
sword-and-sweaty-sandals thing?
and the turkish bath?
huh?
nope.
hey, come on, man.
that's not a judgment, man.
whatever floats your boat.
come on, let's go.
there is to be a fountain of
blood in your days ahead.
a fountain?
my words unsettle you...
you, who has watched legions die,
yet who is the warrior who has
succumbed to the deeds of his past.
to the days ahead, woman.
by your majesty's divine wish.
you must complete
the two remaining trials.
two of the three. yes.
the first trial you passed
through from the time beyond.
the second trial, you-
you must slay the dark mother.
the third trial,
you must find the catalyst.
the catalyst alone...
shall release your restraints
and guide you to your destiny.
pray, do not look to
these men for your salvation,
for they are mere worms
in destiny's eyes,
mere fodder for the winged serpent
of fate, so shiny are they.
worms to the slaughter, you shall
find your end upon the high rocks.
you are alone, chosen one.
you are alone, and there is
much fear upon your path.
the light remains-
the light...
remains only for a time,
and then you shall never be free.
you must cast the fear out of
your heart, or you shall fail.
enough!
it is your fear that weakens you.
it is your fear the loosens
your hold upon this world.
you must leap into the void
to be truly free.
enough, witch.
know your place.
your fear will carry you
to the pits of hell!
the king!
your king commends your bravery.
you shall be honored as heroes.
yeah, well, i hope we don't
get eaten by cannibals.
she's worried too.
you have a strange way
about you, granger.
my lord.
may the gods shine upon you
and bring you home victorious.
over there.
right here?
by the line.
you okay?
yes.
all right.
hide behind that tree.
why don't you guys want to kill me?
because you are he.
so i've been told.
i pass knowing that i was
bested by the chosen one.
i die a valiant death.
talk to me.
tell me what's going on.
only the holy mother...
only the holy mother...
you maniac!
desist!
in the king's decree, desist.
this idiot just stabbed the best
way of getting into their camp!
yeah, i'm talking to you, moron!
i follow the word of my king.
my king's word is law.
desist!
we have wounded!
there are wounded!
i've worked with crazy
bastards like this before.
this is not gonna
end well for anybody.
he follows the word of our king.
leave no dark one alive.
to get in and out of the holy mother's
camp alive, we need information.
harbor no mistruths, granger.
we may reach
the holy mother's sanctum,
but the path shall be
drenched with our blood.
i'll keep that in mind.
if it is to be,
it is to be.
that's an impressive field dressing.
it's not my first.
yeah.
in the time beyond,
would you have the knowledge
to save this man from his wound?
probably.
maybe.
who's to say?
he will die, that soldier.
your words...
"he must be calm."
yeah, look- my anger has
left me since our fight.
i acted in haste.
look, i grabbed you first.
i am my king's servant.
pray, you forgive my actions.
no problem.
listen.
they brought 18 men.
seventeen under our boots, one fled.
now, we're also 18, including
you, me and the doc.
does that seem strange to you?
that they exactly
matched us in numbers?
they followed us to this point.
or we have a spy.
aye.
but why would they not dispatch
a legion to best us?
why did they only match us to the man?
i think that 50 dark ones
raining down on our heads...
would increase the odds
of all of us getting killed,
intentionally or by accident.
their attack, no matter how crude,
was with bloody intent.
for some of us.
now, one of them had a chance
to kill me but didn't.
he was confused, like he wanted
to stab me, but he didn't.
i think the holy mother wants me alive.
for what purpose?
you are her death.
perhaps there's more to this
than we understand.
perhaps.
for now, we need to make ourselves
less conspicuous.
we must dispatch to higher ground.
it is certain.
i have told no one of your plans.
i have uttered not a word.
i'm done with it.
there's some weather moving in.
weather is of no concern.
a bit tougher going
without the horses.
you don't like starting
conversations, do you?
it's not my place.
in the time beyond, are the
expectations of women alike?
no. yes, no...
lt's complicated.
could you tell me about the medicine
from the time beyond?
sure.
well, we have
something called antibiotics.
anti-biotics.
"antibiotics."
like a potion.
of sorts.
you inject it or you swallow it,
usually, and...
from what are they made?
i think it's made from moldy cheese.
cheese?
yeah. you know?
you know that green stuff?
the guy who discovered it,
he realized...
that the moldy cheese
killed the bacteria.
mold. that's all i
remember from biology.
i had too much fun in high school.
i guess i was just, ...
mold.
i guess to you, uh,
high school was just...
was just a school high on a hill.
cheese.
mold.
yep.
cheese mold.
sleep tight, doc.
weapons!
- move!
- come on, let's go!
move!
go, go, go!
go, go, go! now!
take cover!
guess they don't want me alive.
they changed their strategy
after our previous victory.
we have to go over and down.
it's our only chance.
there's too many to fight.
there's no time
for all of us to descend.
they shall rain fire on us
before we reach the bottom.
that's a chance we have to take.
that chance is yours and yours alone.
you will take the woman and flee.
we will defend this ridge
with our lives.
no way.
i'm not leaving you here.
if i believe that you ar
truly the chosen one,
then you must not perish!
go now. complete the journey,
fulfill the prophecy.
are you deaf?
i'm not leaving you here.
i shall never forget you,
granger from a time beyond.
i trust you shall do me the same honor.
i must follow him.
my loyal soldiers,
it has been an honor to have led you.
to the other side,
through a shower of their blood!
coward.
elianna.
you okay?
i'm thoroughly bruised.
let's go.
they have passed from this world.
good-bye, soldier.
come on.
allard saved our lives that morning.
let's face it:
he probably saved the
world as we know it.
come on. let's go.
the poor wretch.
when was this heinous act committed?
perhaps two hours ago, my lord.
the witch was held fast
without guards.
what kind of a man enacts
such brutality on a woman?
what kind of a creature does this?
search the fortress.
comb the grounds.
bring the perpetrator to me by nightfall.
mark me, a dark curtain
has fallen around our kingdom.
honor thy seer, and bury her deep.
yes, my lord.
are there parts of your body
to which i must attend?
sorry?
injuries.
i got lucky.
we got lucky.
perhaps the gods
have seen fit to grant us...
why are you covering your face?
it is cracked.
the liquid, it is poison.
the water corrects its form
and renders it harmless.
poison?
for the holy mother.
or is there something else
i should know?
if we were taken, i was to drink.
you mean like cyanide?
it kills you instantly?
it instantly kills its bearer...
and eradicates all
who come in contact with him.
you mean like a going-away, "don't
get captured" present from the king?
the king is an alchemist.
he has helped many
with his skills since taking the craft.
you sure it's okay there in the creek,
or did we just send a "get stuffed"
message to the people downstream?
the water corrects its form.
it is harmless now.
it is a plague.
oh, great.
i was wondering who was
carrying our biological weapons.
we must reach the dark
mother's cabin by nightfall.
you're not going anywhere, doc.
my flesh is bruised,
but my bones are intact.
you're not going anywhere.
do not trifle with me.
i will accompany you
to the mother's camp.
not on this foot, doc,
and you know it.
sons of whores.
i have failed you.
this spot is secluded enough.
got the woods behind you.
you got a fresh water supply.
- you'll be safe here. do you have a weapon?
- aye.
all right, if i'm not back within two days,
go back to the fortress.
and while you're here,
stab anyone who isn't me.
wait!
if you believe what i do,
it is a protective talisman,
perhaps more.
if you don't believe what i do,
it is still something beautiful
at which to look.
just keep yourself safe.
reconnaissance...
terrestrial foreplay
to successful ground warfare.
get in, get your information...
and get the hell out
with your scalp intact.
dark ones.
stay down.
by the gods, i'm no cook.
leave me alone and i'll poison myself.
undercooked.
my lord.
- speak.
- no news from the search.
the villain eludes our men...
for now.
as they are meant to do.
in your time you will learn
that villains often hide...
in plain sight.
now leave me, soldier.
my thoughts are troubled
and require my utmost attention.
my lord.
i need to believe that you
are capable, chosen one.
she's in there.
no guards, no armaments.
something isn't right,
but she's in there.
i can feel she's in there.
do this thing or let it pass.
he's here.
watch him.
i have been waiting for you.
i have waited a lifetime
to once more set eyes upon you.
have we met before?
sorry. i'm not
that good with faces.
go.
many nights have i dreamed
of this moment.
you are not a man
who has found peace in his dreams.
my agility is not
what it once had been.
i'm afraid this withered shell has
betrayed my purest intention.
it was my hope to bring you
back to our time myself.
it was you.
the warning came in my dreams.
visions of the attempt
on your life in the time beyond.
i myself ventured to your world...
to ensure that your life
was not taken...
before you could come back to us.
alas, your weapon was formidable.
the king before liberated our lands...
from an evil usurper
bent on domination.
we pushed through great darkness
to find peace, however fleeting.
- raven.
- 'twas barely a man.
the cursed snake
poxed the king's troops.
he released a plague...
which ran unrestrained
through the kingdom,
killing most with agonizing cruelty.
its rein slipped
through his fingers...
the moment he gave it life.
the alchemist.
the king before, his family,
all were lost.
heroic to the end, were they.
then raven took the throne.
coup d'etat using biological weapons.
the loyal were driven
to the mountains.
we fled with the clothes
on our backs...
and the sickness in our blood.
how many rotted
before its tide, i cannot say.
we believe raven secrets the remedy...
inside the fortress walls.
then what have i got to do
with all this?
when the castle
looked to fall to raven,
your father entrusted me
to save your life.
my father?
you are the king before's lost son.
you are our king.
we traveled to your time...
to the time beyond...
where i hid you in a place
that welcomes lost children.
the orphanage.
and there you remained.
then why send men to kill me?
why did you send your men?
i tasked one man to
bring you back to me.
the others, the dark ones who
traveled with him through the gate,
were under his command.
he twisted my words...
for his own cause.
it appears we have a
traitor in our midst.
thane abandoned our cause...
for his own vengeful blood-lust.
and this is how you seek
to avenge our fallen?
by making peace
with the tyrant that cast us out?
never!
mark my words, old woman.
we shall have our vengeance.
i have seen your
passing, and it is near.
you presume to weave the
truth, to shift my resolve.
as it is seen, so it shall pass.
to the gods i swear
your death shall be quick.
raven...
butchered his family
before his very eyes.
we must not cast stones.
my lord, don't.
don't, please.
god.
god has left this place.
a fortnight
after the king's sorcerer...
brings you back to our time,
your time beyond is no more.
a carrier travels
back to your world...
and releases the plague.
raven's alchemy.
the lethal snake crawls
across your world without mercy.
a fortnight,
and all are lost in the time beyond.
my lord.
what say you?
our spies tell us the chosen one has
entered the dark mother's camp.
and any word of his plight?
he is alive.
she has him and he lives?
aye. the dark mother lives,
as does the chosen one.
how does this come to pass?
it is the blackest of sorcery!
he was supposed to slay
the witch in her bed!
ready my horse,
and alert the royal guard.
my lord.
we shall flush out this
traitorous wretch from beyond.
i shall flush you out.
i have moments left in this life.
is there a way to get back
to the time beyond?
i have medicine that could save you.
i am too weak,
and it is fate that i pass over
from my own time.
you keep talking
about destiny, about fate.
i don't believe in it.
i believe we make our own
destiny, follow our own plans.
aye, i could see it no other way.
then why do you keep talking about
destiny deciding this or that?
i have dreamt of the
passing of your world,
of the blackened corpses
lining your streets,
but i know not of how the
sickness came to find your time.
and in this uncertainty lies hope,
in this not knowing hides the
dragon that shall slay the tyrant.
you believe i can change my future?
i believe you shall change
all our futures.
i never asked you, why
do they cover their faces?
to honor the dead...
who have been taken
from us by the plague.
- look, i have to get you back to your hut.
- no.
you're too sick.
no.
soon i shall pass,
and until the moment...
that you return to the time beyond,
you are their king.
lead them with your heart.
i hope your dreams bring
you peace, holy mother.
safe home.
i am dunyana, my lord.
what are you going to do with her?
we shall prepare her
for the honorable passage.
our road becomes more
treacherous with her passing.
you shall enter the black forest
and retrieve the catalyst.
which is what?
i know not of its form.
then how am i supposed to find it?
it is said the chosen one
shall seek the catalyst.
so it is written, so it
shall- lt shall pass.
yeah, i know.
i understand.
but we just go
with the flow around here...
and hope not to get screwed, right?
screwed?
yeah.
you know, compromised,
left vulnerable.
your words, yeah, i know.
it is literally black.
thought that was just some medieval...
gloom and doom.
pray you heed my words.
no man has entered the black
forest and lived to tell the tale.
there are dark forces at work
within its woods.
some say sorcery, others speak
knowingly of enchanted beasts.
with the holy mother's passing,
our connection to the beasts
within is severed.
they roam freely without
her spells of containment.
i cannot speak to your safety.
wonderfully cryptic.
we shall accompany you
to its edge and no further.
thus it has been decreed
by the holy mother.
my lord.
can't tell me anything
about this catalyst?
i'm going in with zero intel?
my lord, i know not of its origins.
it is said the catalyst shall bring peace
to our world, yet we know not how.
i've heard many stories how to
bring peace to a place in my time,
but your prophecy
is refreshingly vague.
let's see what we can find in there.
come on!
my lord.
what news have you?
the holy mother has passed.
and the chosen one?
they accompany him
to the black forest.
for what purpose?
it...
is the location of the catalyst.
so the prophecy rings true.
the gods themselves
conspire to make it so.
i shall rule the kingdom united.
you are excused.
my servant.
your loyalty will be remembered.
food for the hours within.
thanks.
so i guess this is it.
aye. we are at the impasse.
follow the signs and the catalyst
shall reveal itself to you.
our people are watched from within...
spies who pledge their
allegiance to the tyrant.
raven.
aye, the serpent himself.
pray you, if you should cross
paths once again,
that you strike at him mercilessly
so that he is screwed.
have i offended you, my lord?
no.
it's just...
you remind me of her.
you speak of the holy mother?
yes.
i see now...
that you're her daughter.
it was my honor.
and when this is over,
when i've returned
with the catalyst...
and raven is screwed,
who takes over the kingdom?
my lord?
the throne.
who sits on the throne if i manage
to return to the time beyond?
as king without son,
you select your rightful heir, my lord.
it is our custom.
and your people will return
to the fortress?
we shall await the catalyst to show us
the way through their fortifications.
then what?
our people have been
on the outside for far too long.
we shall secure the antidote
to our sickness.
if we are able to heal our numbers,
to unite our people once again,
it is my dream that a peace
shall become true.
peace?
aye. it is all that matters.
you should be a righteous queen.
no, my lord,
i cannot accept this honor.
you can and you will.
i've decreed it.
hey, listen, guys.
i've decreed it. my lord.
my lord, perhaps you'd
prefer a larger blade.
i have a feeling in the black forest,
size does matter.
it is forbidden to
touch a king, but i...
your mother advised me
to rule with my heart,
but i'm not much of a poet,
so i can only offer you her words.
oh, my god,
i'm starting to talk like you.
godspeed, my lord.
i can't believe this medieval crap.
pull forward!
is he in there?
halt!
enter these woods
and bring me the chosen one.
the woods are haunted, my lord.
not man nor beast
have escaped its clutches.
my king.
would your insolence betray
the peace of our kingdom?
no, my lord.
then enter these woods...
and show the demons that you
are soldiers of the realm!
retrieve the chosen one,
and bring the catalyst to me!
my lord!
my 10 best, follow me!
move!
yes, my lord!
forward!
for the king!
for king and country.
move!
come here, lads!
all right.
keep your mind fixed on the goal.
find the catalyst and get
your ass out of there...
before something eats you.
doubt a grizzly could do that.
i suddenly wish you were a grizzly.
easy, boy.
here!
- manhattan?
- run!
nice to see you.
how you been?
never thought
i'd be chased by a dragon.
you have aligned yourself
with the dark mother!
change of strategy.
i am confused by your betrayal.
well, we're on a bit of a
schedule, so i'll keep it brief.
my king.
yes.
it seems like he's responsible
for spreading a plague,
orchestrating a coup
against the king before.
now i have to find the catalyst and
save this world and the time beyond...
because i'm the king before's son.
this cannot be.
yeah, what the hell?
exactly, am i right?
son of a bitch. we're still being
chased by a dragon. let's go.
by the way, the holy mother's dead.
what?
whatever you think you're here to do,
we all better
get the hell out of here.
we are the guardians of the realm.
we stand aside not for man,
nor for beast!
good luck with that, custer.
for king! for country!
aaah!
no!
the end of the devilish woods.
i can't go with you.
i haven't recovered the catalyst.
we shall return anon.
up there only death awaits.
i have to go.
do you not value your life?
to ascend is madness!
i'll circle around and
avoid the big nasty.
surround them!
we're screwed, aren't we?
watch her.
yeah, don't let her run.
we're screwed.
i'll take four of you pussies
with me, and you know it.
to resist now
would be pure folly, granger.
you were the one that brought
the plague upon our houses.
you!
curb your tongue, doctor.
i am still your king.
you are the true villain of this tale.
well, granger from the time beyond,
before nightfall...
your entrails will be hanging
from the fortress gate.
bring them both.
yes, sir.
pick him up.
welcome to your final moments
in this world, wretch.
the devil himself awaits your passing.
blasphemy, you cursed witch!
this man is your rightful king...
the king before's son.
on the life of my mother!
lies!
you are the black-tongued
agent of the dark mother.
take them from their steed.
i shall end their life
where they stand!
this one. come on.
bring them here.
i shall cut your guts out myself.
no!
- stop him!
- strike him!
grab him!
he is your rightful king!
this looks bad.
it was an honor to fight by your side
and mate with you as your woman.
run! shit.
incoming.
run!
raven is making way to the portal...
the portal to your world.
the gate! the gate!
quick! lock it!
look out!
our sister has brought down their walls.
the dragon is the catalyst...
the catalyst!
we hold.
our time.
our time!
surprise attack!
look out!
for the holy mother.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
he secrets two vials on
his person at all times.
two. go!
my actions are either that of a fool...
or a conqueror.
go!
only you can save your world!
and i shall save mine.
we may see each other again.
aaah!
i could have brought peace to my time.
peace!
i am your king!
you were never king.
history's full of losers like you.
we did it.
will i ever see you again?
what is it you said?
perhaps in my dreams tonight.
perhaps another time.
perhaps another time.
