[airplane landing]
[wheels touching down]
[chattering]
[footsteps]
[loudspeaker, people chattering]
- you okay?
- i'm fine, mate. don't worry about it.
you all right?
enjoy l.a.
[speaks french]
[men yelling in spanish]
he did it.
[silence]
- [man] everthing's always about you.
- [woman] it's not.
that gearhead was being sarcastic
and you know it.
- i just didn't see it that way.
- bullshit.
what about the dig
about the makeover?
what do you want me to do?
i work with him, for chrissake.
you're capable of taking care
of your own shit.
you know something? last time i checked,
you were sleeping with me.
so unless you want to start fucking him,
i suggest...
[both speaking spanish]
hey, pal. where can i catch a shuttle
to the airport around here?
- right there.
- thanks.
it was him in that gold lexus
with the cell phone.
are they still asking for
a change of venue?
he's enhanceable because
of priors in the early '80s.
- where to?
- downtown. 31 2 north spring street.
downtown.
look, the transcriptions need to be done
by 7 a.m., period, okay?
hold on. take sepulveda
to slauson to la brea.
take la brea north to 6th,
into downtown.
so what? you'll be up late.
i'm pulling an all-nighter too,
so save the tears.
- i'll take 105 east to the 110. it's faster.
- what?
the 105 to the 110
will get you there quicker.
the 110 turns into a parking lot
around usc.
but once you get to la brea
north of santa monica, it's jammed.
the 110 north of the 10, you get people
driving to pasadena and they drive slow.
yeah, they do, but what i do is
i get off on grand and then l...
surface roads is what you want,
that's what we'll do.
are we taking bets?
- are we?
- and what if you're wrong?
i don't think i'll be wrong,
but if i am...
...your ride's free.
okay, you got yourself a deal.
- go ahead, say it.
- say what?
- go ahead.
- i got lucky with the lights.
you weren't lucky.
what you were was right.
i was wrong...
...max.
you mind turning that up?
you like the classics.
- i do. i used to play in high school.
- let me guess. woodwinds.
no. strings. never had the lungs
for wind instruments.
could've fooled me the way you were
unloading on that cell phone.
[woman] different instrument.
if you had just listened to me, we'd be
all bogged down in traffic right now,
and you would've made
an extra five bucks.
yeah, well, you keep that 5 bucks.
buy you something special. go wild.
really, it's not a big deal.
nothing big here.
how many cabbies do you know get you
into an argument to save you money?
there were two of us.
i had to kill the other one.
i don't like competition.
take pride in being good
at what you do?
what, this?
no, this is part-time.
this is a fill-in job.
pay the bills.
but i will be the best at what i do.
but that's something else.
- what else?
- just shaping up some things.
like...?
tell me.
limo company i'm putting together.
island limos.
it'll be like a island on wheels.
a cool groove, like a club experience.
when you get to the airport,
you won't want to get out of my limo.
so i do this part-time
to get my benz off leases...
staff up, get the right client list.
you know, things like that.
how do you like being a lawyer?
- what are you, psychic?
- little bit.
there's the dark pinstripe suit.
elegant, not too flashy.
that rules out advertising.
plus a top-drawer briefcase
that you live out of.
and the purse. a bottega.
anyway, a man gets in my cab with
a sword, i figure he's a sushi chef.
- [laughing]
- you?
clarence darrow.
well, no, not quite. he worked defense.
i'm a prosecutor.
- big case?
- yeah.
[sighs]
- got us here fast.
- of course.
but you didn't answer my question.
you like what you do?
yeah.
but not today.
no, i do. like, i can't wait.
i love standing in that courtroom.
at the same time, i get this...
...clenched up thing
the night before the first days.
clenched up? how?
i think i'm going to lose.
i think the case sucks,
my exhibits aren't in order,
i'm not prepared enough, people will
find out i don't know what i'm doing
and i've been running a charade
all these years.
i represent the department of justice,
and my opening statement will fall flat
at the most important point
and the jury will laugh at me.
and then i cry.
i don't throw up.
a lot of people throw up.
i have a strong stomach.
and then i pull myself together,
i rewrite my opening statement...
work my exhibits and that's what i do
for the rest of the night.
that's my routine.
in the morning it starts and i'm fine.
you need a vacation.
i just had a vacation
on the harbor freeway.
not in a cab.
you need to get your head straight.
get your unified self up.
get harmonic, you know...
- when did you last take a break?
- i go on vacation all the time.
- how often?
- a dozen times a day.
my favorite spot:
maldives lslands.
it's my own private getaway.
things get heavy for me, i take
five minutes out and i just go there.
and i just concentrate
on absolutely nothing.
- here. take it.
- i couldn't do that.
take it because you need it
a lot more than i do.
and it'll help you.
i guarantee it.
thanks, max.
go get 'em.
[tapping]
hey.
i don't know...
in case you ever want to investigate
a fortune 500 company, or...
...argue cab routes.

[electronic beep]
hey.
come on, man, i'm sorry.
i didn't hear you, man. come on.

gotcha.
- [man] how long you think this'll take?
- [max] seven minutes.
seven. not eight? not six?
two minutes from the 110 to normandie.
normandie to venice, three minutes.
over to union is one,
plus one for "shit happens."
- okay if i time you?
- knock yourself out.
what do i get if you're wrong?
a free ride?
an apology.
already offered my free ride today.
- to who?
- some girl.
did you get a date with her?
first time in l.a.?
no. tell you the truth, whenever
i'm here i can't wait to leave.
it's too sprawled out, disconnected.
you know? that's me.
- you like it?
- it's my home.
it's the fifth biggest economy in the world
and nobody knows each other.
i read about this guy
gets on the mta here, dies.
[max] oh.
six hours he rides the subway
before anyone notices his corpse
doing laps around l.a.,
people on and off sitting next to him.
nobody notices.
[man] this is the cleanest cab
i've ever been in.
[man] regular ride?
yeah, i share it
with the day shift guy.
[man] you prefer nights?
people are more relaxed.
less stress, less traffic, better tips.
- [man] how are the benefits?
- it's not that kind of job.
i'm not in this for the long haul.
just filling in.
temporary while i get
some things shaped up.
this is just temporary.
- how long you been driving?
- 12 years.
really?
what other things you putting together?
um...
you know, i don't want to talk about it.
just a little business plan.
- no offense. i just...
- none taken.
you're one of these guys that do
instead of talk.
that's cool.
seven minutes.
man, you're good.
- i got lucky with the lights.
- yeah, sure.
you probably know
the light schedules too.
listen, i'm in town on a real estate deal,
close in one night.
i got five stops to make.
collect signatures, see some friends,
and then i got a 6 a.m. out of lax.
- why don't you hang with me?
- the car's not for hire. against regs.
[scoffing] regulations?
they don't pay you sick leave.
how much you pull down a shift?
- how much?
- 350, 400.
well, let me tell you what,
i'll make it 600.
man, i don't know.
an extra 1 00 you get me to lax
and i don't run for the plane.
- i don't know about this.
- yeah, you do.
- i don't know, man.
- yeah, you do.

[phone ringing]
[on tv],,,where a man wants his wife
back or a boyfriend-girlfriend thing,
we hear, "get your protective order, "
[man] a protective order's
a tool we use,
but often times it's just
a piece of paper to the stalker,
- [man] mr, clarke, there 's a notary here,
- did he identify himself as a notary?
yes, he did,
all right, sure, send him up.
[woman on tv] or shoots them?
that happens too often,
[man on tv] but we use it as a tool,
i say a lot of times,
in this situation
strangers may write or call,
but how often, in fact, are stalkers
people that the recipient
of those affections knows?
[honking]
[max] hey, i'm in the cab!
hey!

but, hey, new news...
we're ahead of schedule.
- like jazz?
- sorry. what?
jazz. you like jazz?

what's your informant's name? ramone?
ramone ayala. supposed to meet him
in bellflower last night.
he doesn't show up,
i roll here, find this.
- how long you been working this guy?
- four months. he's a low-level player.
part of a distribution network
that hooks up to felix.
felix reyes-torrena?
feds are all over him,
don't want us anywhere near it.
since when's lapd
working for the feeb?
they'll just take our stuff,
build their case, take the credit.
- what's the point?
- the point is my guy flew out a window.
so if my cl flies out a window,
he's got felix's handprints on his ass.
that makes it mine.
is there a crime here? a homicide?
you got a body?
- just a bunch of broken glass.
- and blood.
down here, in the glass.
here's some more.
and there's some spatter patterns
over there and over here.
- [woman] richard?
- yeah, it's me.
ramone went through that window...
splat.
glass here, then tires rolled over it.
maybe he jumped.
sure. he's depressed so he jumps four
stories out of a window onto his head.
"that feels better"
picks himself up.
"now i think i'll go on
with the rest of my day"
- come on, man.
- hey, ray!
catch.
- recent?
- you can still smell the cordite.
old guy across the alley watching tv
says he saw a cab earlier tonight
- with two guys walking around the hood.

like coke bottles.
there are 4,000 taxicabs in l.a. county.
you got anything else?
that's it.
okay. keep knocking.
let's keep knocking.
remember that bay area deal? oakland?
cabby drove around all night,
killed three people,
- then put the gun to his head.
- he flipped out. so what?
so that oakland detective
never bought it.
cabby had no criminal record
or history of mental illness.
pops three people, then himself?
anyway, that detective always thought
there was someone else in that cab.
[jazz music plays]
i never learned to listen to jazz.
it's off melody. behind the notes.
not what's expected.
- lmprovising, like tonight.
- like tonight?
most people, ten years from now,
same job, place, routine.
everthhing the same.
just keeping it safe over and over.
ten years from now.
man, you don't know where you'll be
ten minutes from now.
do you?
who is that on the trumpet?
[woman] that's daniel, baby,
he's the owner.
he's terrific. would you be so kind
as to invite him over after his set?
- i got to buy him a drink.
- sure thing, darling.
[daniel] now see, i was about 1 9,
bussing tables right here.
the money wasn't shit,
but that wasn't the point.
it was about being around the music.
and i was.
take this one night. july 22nd, 1 964.
who you think walks through that door?
[woman] bye, baby.
- miles davis. that's right.
- in the flesh?
i'm talking about through those doors,
the coolest man on the planet.
jesus.
anyway, he had been recording a session
up at columbia, up on vine.
so miles comes through that door.
before you know it, he's up on
the bandstand, jamming with the band.
i mean, it had to be...
oh, it was scary.
i mean, the dude was so focused, man.
plus, he was kind of
a scary cat anyway.
everybody and their mama knew you don't
just come up and talk to miles davis.
i mean, he may have looked like
he was chilling, but he was absorbed.
this one young, hip couple, one of them
tried to shake his hand one day.
and the guy says,
"hi, my name is.."
miles said, "get out of my face,
you jive motheefucker.
take your silly bitch with you"
[both laugh]
you know? that was miles, man.
that's the way he was when he was
in his musical headspace. fierce.
- but did you get to talk to him?
- better than that.
i played for about 20 minutes.
[vincent] unbelievable.
- how'd you do?
- how'd i do?
you really ain't shit
playing next to miles davis.
but he carried my ass.
[vincent] what'd he say?
he said one word: cool.
cool?
- that's it?
- yeah.
that meant, "good, but not ready"
it meant, "look me up when you are"
did you?
no. i got drafted
and got into some other things.
and by the time i got back to music,
season had passed.
you know, i was born in 1 945,
but that night was the moment
of my conception.
- right here in this room.
- crowd's not here now.
well, jazz ain't the draw
that it used to be.
what a great story.
i got to tell the people in culiacan
and cartagena that story.
you know the folks
in culiacan and cartagena?
afraid so.
just when i thought
you were a cool guy.
i am a cool guy with a job
i contracted to do.
- come on, give the dude a pass.
- i'm working here.
you're the one talking
about improvisation.
you like the guy, how he plays.
let's just play a little jazz.
improvi...
that's funny coming from you.
how's this?
- i'll ask a question.
- [daniel] what question?
a jazz question.
now, you get it right, we roll.
you disappear tonight.
if i walk out of here tonight,
i will go so far away,
it'll be just like i was dead.
and one more thing: these people
and their rep here, felix...
well, you tell them i'm sorry.
you tell them i had to.
they laid a grant of immunity on me.
it was either play ball
or go back inside.
and i'm not going back inside.
yeah.
lay it on me.
where did miles learn music?
- i know everthhing about miles.
- then let's have it.
music school.
he got into music school, right?
his father was a dentist,
east st. louis.
invested in agriculture,
made plenty of money.
he sent miles to juilliard school
of music, new york, 1 945.
man.
dropped out in less than a year, tracked
down charlie parker on 52nd street
who mentored him
for the next three years.
hey.
- no, i'm done. find you another cab.
- max.
leave me alone.
i'm collateral, anyway.
[grunting]
[max panting]
i am not playing.
you played him, man.
he got the answer right...
...would you have let him go?
[lenny on radio] 102, max,
what is it with this guy?
- you hassling my driver again?
- who are you?
the same guy you talked to last time.
max's mother's driving me crazy,
put him on the line, please,
hang on.
carefully.
yeah?
your mother's calling,
"why didn't you show?
- are you all right? where are you?"
- [vincent] show for what?
t ell her i can't make it tonight.
i'm not related to you,
tell her yourself,
show up for what?
she's in the hospital.
- you visit every night?
- yeah. what's the difference?
- you don't show up, it breaks routine.
- so?
so people start looking for you, this cab.
that's not good.
i'm not taking you to see my mother.
since when was any of this negotiable.
two paces ahead, one to the left.
flowers?
it's a waste of money.
won't mean a thing to her.
she carried you in her womb
for nine months.
people buy flowers. buy flowers.
excuse me.
keep the change.
[bell rings]
[man] hold that elevator, please.
- floor?
- five. thanks.
- having a good night?
- mezzo mezzo,
you?
excuse me.
hey, ma.
i've been calling and calling.
- i got caught up at work.
- why couldn't you call me?
i'm lying here wondering if something
terrible happened to you.
- i brought you flowers.
- what am i gonna do with flowers?
- cheer up.
- how?
by worrying that you spend money
on stuff that's just going to wilt and die?
see what i mean?
i didn't buy you the flowers. he did.
who?
why didn't you tell me we had company?
what's your name?
sorry my son is rude.
no harm done, ma'am.
you paid for my flowers?
they're beautiful.
well, max?
mother, this is vincent.
vincent, this is my mother, lda.
i am very happy to meet you,
mrs. durocher.
[chuckling] oh, just call me lda.
ida. i was with max
when he got the call.
- [lda] you came here to see me?
- [vincent] it's nothing, ma'am.
tell my son.
you have to hold a gun to his head
to make him do anything.
you must be one of
max's important clients.
client? you know, i like to think
of myself as his friend.
[lda] max never had many friends.
always talking to himself in the mirror.
it's unhealthy.
how many times i got to ask
don't do that?
do what?
don't talk about me like
i'm not right here in the room here.
what's he saying?
[vincent] he says he's standing
right here in the room here.
yes, you are.
he's sensitive.
i know. but i'm sure
you're very proud of him.
of course i'm proud.
he started with nothing, you know?
look at him today.
here, vegas...
mom, he is not interested in hearing
about all that, okay?
i came to see you, i saw you,
you look good, let's go.
i am very interested, lda. please.
- limousine companies.
- is that right?
he drives famous people around.
famous people. limousine companies.
now, that's quite an achievement.
- [lda] what did you say your name was?
- my name's vincent, ma'am.
visit again?
[vincent] no, i'm just in town tonight.
- [lda] when you come back.
- [vincent] sure.
max!
don't!
[max screams]
all my prep was in there.
you are screwing with my work.
[ragged breathing]
let's see what else you can do.
[max groans]
well, i've had four come in tonight.
maybe one's your guy.
no, not ramone. let's see this one.
no, next.
there's something funny
about this, though.
these three all came in within
half an hour of each other, right?
the kid and that last guy,
both done by the same shooter, i think.
why do you say that?
wound pattern.
two in the sternum, one in the head.
this guy is shooting tight groups too,
all right? check this out.
double taps are
a couple millimeters apart.
let's see this one.
see what i mean?
holy shit.
can i use your phone?
come on, come on, wake up.
[ringing]
hello.
it's fanning. i'm still down here
at the morgue at sisters of charity.
john does didn't pan out, but you'll
never guess who's in the meat locker.
who?
sylvester clarke, criminal attorney
turned lawyer criminal.
[fanning] including ramone,
who he represented, who's still missing,
both are in
the exotic substances business together.
there's something going on,
and i don't think the feds know about it.
stay on your cell phone.
i got the asac's phone.
i'll hook up with you in 30 minutes.
good.
going to a place called el rodeo.
it's on washington boulevard, pico rivera.
- where at on washington?
- look it up.
limos, huh?
don't start.
i'm not the one lying to my mother.
she hears what she wants to hear.
i don't disillusion her.
right. maybe she hears
what you tell her.
whatever i tell her's never good enough.
it's always been that way.
so, what's at el rodeo?
just drive.
they project onto you their flaws.
what they don't like about themselves,
their lives, whatever.
they rank on you instead.
how do you know?
i had a father like that.
- mothers are worse.
- wouldn't know.
my mother died
before i remember her.
what happened to your father?
hated everthhing i did.
got drunk, beat me up, foster homes.
went back with him. like that.
then what?
i killed him.
i was 1 2.
[laughing]
i'm kidding.
he died of liver disease.
well, i'm sorry.
no, you're not.
so, what is this "driving a cab temporarily"
it's all bullshit?
it is not bullshit.
[vincent] 1 2 years isn't temporary.
got to get the cash together.
insurance, bonds, maintenance, tires.
got to staff up,
get the right client list.
it's not just get the car
and put asses in the seats.
why not?
because lsland limos
is more than just a ride.
it's like a club experience.
cool groove.
don't want it to end.
it's got to be peefect.
peefect.
it's up here. turn right.
give me your wallet. come on.
give me your wallet. come on.
give you my wallet. for what?
i'll hold it for you
in case the people inside search you.
- who's searching?
- the people inside.
go in, ask for felix.
he's expecting you.
- felix. what does he look like?
- i don't know, i never met him.
who is he?
he's connected to the guys
who hired me.
i don't get it.
you destroyed my work-ups.
number four is due.
what'd you think, night's over?
called on account of rain?
go in there, say you're me.
score the backups.
- they'll be on flash drive or cd.
- how come you don't...
i don't meet people. anonymity.
i protect mine.
you're not going to screw that up.
contract's with their bosses.
these guys don't meet me,
or know what i look like.
if i don't pull it off, then...
they will kill you.
you got 1 0 minutes.
at 1 0:01, i execute your mother
on my way out of town.
- don't pretend indifference.
- i can't do this.
- i can't.
- sure you can. come on. hey, hey.
if i do this, i'm just going to end up
getting people killed.
out of options. take comfort in knowing
you never had a choice.
- how long you been doing this?
- why?
just in case they ask me.
- private sector? six years.
- okay. all right. six years.
you get benefits?
or, you know, insurance? pension?
no. no paid sick leave.
quit stalling, get out of the cab.
[max sighing]
[indistinct chatter, music]
hold on, man.
who's this?
mark the time.
all right, he's clean.
what's up, holmes?
i'm here to see felix.
he has something for me.
don't know no felix.
tell him...
say it's vincent.
i'm vincent.
[speaks spanish]
[indistinct, on walkie-talkie]
copy.
let him in. let him in right now.
[door clattering open]
detective richard weidner, lapd,
major narcotics division.
- detective ray fanning...
- ok, how are you? agent frank pedrosa.
- thanks for seeing us.
- how can i help?
why do you want to know
about our case?
- any unusual activity tonight?
- like what?
that relates to a series of murders
in wilshire central or west hollywood?
all quiet on the western front.
various people are asleep.
various people are not.
they come and go in cars,
pickups, taxis.
other than that, we watch air move.
- your interest in our case?
- we got a situation. two bodies.
could be a coincidence,
could not be a coincidence.
it doesn't look like one.
we got an attorney and his client...
roof's all beat to shit.
roof's all beat to shit.
- can you zoom in on this?
- on what?
on that.
- [fanning] look at that right there.
- [weidner] what is it?
yeah.
[jazzy latin music plays]
i thought you'd be taller.
so, vincent...
- what are the two names?
- ramone ayala and clarke.
ramone ayala and clarke
were murdered tonight? both killed?
- clarke for sure. ramone, i don't know.
- i got another d.o.a.
daniel baker out of south central,
leimert park.
that's three.
- three what?
- witnesses.
vincent meets their people
in culiacan or cartagena.
but he don't meet you. ok.
now you're here.
why?
i lost my stuff.
the list.
i want you to listen to me real well.
special groups put together
the list of dedos.
- dedos.
- fingers. informants.
signal interceptions with
voice-recognition software, surveillance.
a very expensive counterintelligence
worked up that list.
an important list. wouldn't you say?
and you lost it?
yeah. i'm sorry.
sorry.
sorry? "sorry" does not put
humpty dumpty back together again.
- do you believe in humpty dumpty?
- no.
- do you believe in santa claus?
- no.
nor do l.
nor do l, but my children do.
they are still small.
but do you know who they like even
better than santa claus? his helper.
pedro el negro. black peter.
there's an old mexican tale
that tells of how santa claus
got so busy looking out
for the good children,
that he had to hire some help
to look out for the bad children.
so he hired pedro.
and santa claus gave him a list
with all the names of all the bad children.
and pedro would come every night
to check them out.
and the people, the little kids
that were misbehaving,
that were not saying their prayers,
pedro would leave a little
toy donkey on their windows.
a little burro,
and he would come back.
if they were still misbehaving,
pedro would take them away
and nobody would ever see them again.
now, if i am being santa claus,
and you are pedro,
how do you think
jolly old santa claus would feel
if one day pedro came into his office
and said, "l lost the list"?
how fucking furious
do you think he will get?
tell me, vincent.
tell me what you think.
- [clears throat]
- what?
i think...
i think you should tell the guy...
behind me...
...to put that gun down.
what did you say?
i said you should tell the guy
behind me to put his gun away
before i take it and beat
his bitch ass to death with it.
i picked up a tail.
- federal?
- i don't know, you tell me.
that's why i tossed the list.
the work-ups, all of that shit.
to protect, in part...
your hermes faconnable ass.
you think i like coming in here?
but, hey...
...shit happens.
got to roll with it. adapt.
darwin. i ching.
the fat man, the penthouse guy,
the jazz man.
that leaves two.
can you finish?
in six years...
...when have i not?
[max, distorted] say it's vincent.
i'm vincent.
- [rewinding]
- say it's vincent.
i'm vincent.
say it's vincent.
i'm vincent.
- [weidner] vincent?
- [woman] that's what i'm hearing.
[max] i'm vincent.
your last two.
and by the way,
as a token of my appreciation
i would like to offer you a discount.
for all my services, 25 percent.
very generous.
hell, make it 35.
and by the way...
daniel said he was sorry.
interesting.
[mumbles in spanish]
[crowd chatters, indistinct]
e-mail me his license.
[fanning] to my cell phone.
no, no, i'll wait.
is there anybody else in that cab?
[vincent] vegas odds would've been
against you walking out of there.
yeah, i'm very impressive.
sixth street by alexandria,
a club called fever. you know it?
locate our witness, peter lim.
get him evacuated and safe.
[pedrosa] l.a. 1 01 to chase units.
african american, medium build.
the assault team will do the takedown.
do not spook him before.
i want air support
to maintain at 1 500 feet.
thank you.
- how long?
- 1 2 minutes.
according to the cab's dispatch unit,
he's been driving that cab for 1 2 years.
so what?
you're telling me the guy
walks into a phone booth
and changes into a meat-eater
super assassin?
what's he do,
squeeze them in between fares?
the real driver is floating down
a storm drain.
[fanning] the guy who walked out
looks like this.
- he picked a driver who looks like him.
- i don't know.
i do. zee?
we see private-sector security companies
hiring out to cartels
in colombia, russia, mexico,
hiring ex-special forces, stasi,
ex-kgb, like that, all the time.
guys with trigger time, skill sets,
tradecraft, look like a cab driver.
what are you going to do?
take his ass down.
save our witness.
what if they're wrong?
the guy's admitting his name is vincent.
he's in there talking to the bad guys.
- there is something else going on.
- there's nothing.
i thought there was, there isn't.
it's their ball, their game.
- there's nothing in it for us.
- nothing for you.
it's late, i'm going home.
you know what time it is?
[tires screeching]
they locate peter lim?
- [zee] the wife thinks he's at fever.
- [pedrosa] sixth and alexandria. move it.
l.a. 1 01 to l.a. 1 03,
l.a. 1 05, l.a. 1 08.
witness is at fever, sixth and alexandria.
that's where vincent is going.
[pedrosa] assault team
and remaining unit, take vincent.
first unit on the scene
will get the witness out.
l.a. 1 05 to l.a. 1 01.
we copy that.
- you going to call her?
- who?
your lady friend.
the one who gave you her business card.
i don't know. maybe, maybe not.
what?
pick up the phone.
life's short. one day it's gone.
you and i make it out of this alive,
you should call her.
that's what i think.
anyway...
[pedrosa] there he is. hit it.
[pedrosa] let's do it.
[throbbing club music plays]
[vincent] the table towards the back
is where he hangs.
wilke, take the right.
brian, hold the door.
clean shots.
watch your backgrounds.
move 1 5 feet ahead, three feet left.
wander, innocent bystanders
get the first rounds. clear?
- [grunting]
- [snapping]
- [crunching]
- [screaming]
[pained groaning]
there's lim. second booth from the left.
get him out.
[clubbers chattering]
middle of the dance floor.
freeze, vincent!
fbl! fbl! get your hands in the air!
get your hands in the air, vincent!
- this is the fbl! hands in the air!
- fbl. where's peter lim?
- [shouting in korean]
- drop it!
[screaming]
freeze!
- i'm not vincent.
- fbl!
yo, put the gun down!

[screaming]
pedrosa's been shot.

wait, wait!
hold on. i'm detective fanning.
i'm max! i'm a goddamn cab driver, man!
i'm a goddamn cab driver.
i know. i'm getting you out of here.
i'm lapd. come on.
[shouting in korean]
- how'd you find me?
- you're okay. just move it.
keep moving.
[fanning] you're ok, you're ok.
you're ok. you're all right.
- [shots, crowd screams]
- let's go!
[car alarm sounding]
let's go.
go! drive! drive!
[metal, glass crunching]
[chopper buzzing]
[sirens]
only thing didn't show up
was the polish cavalry.
you're alive. i saved you.
do i get any thanks?
no. all you can do is clam up.
you want to talk?
tell me to fuck off?
fuck off.
you had to kill fanning?
- who the fuck is fanning?
- fanning, the cop.
why'd you have to kill him?
he's probably got a family.
kids will grow up without him.
he believed me.
i should've saved him
because he believed you.
- not that.
- yeah. that.
what's wrong with that?
- it's what i do for a living.
- some living.
- head downtown.
- what's downtown?
how are you at math?
i was hired for five hits. i did four.
why didn't you just kill me
and get another cab driver?
you're good. we're in this together.
fates intertwined. cosmic coincidence.
- you full of shit.
- i'm full of shit?
you even bullshitted yourself,
if all i am is taking out garbage,
killing bad people.
- that's what you said.
- you believe me?
[exasperated sigh]
- then what'd they do?
- how do i know?
they all got that
"witness for the prosecution" look to me.
probably some major federal indictment
of somebody who majorly
does not want to get indicted.
so that's the reason?
that's the "why."
there's no reason.
there's no good or bad reason
to live or to die.
then what are you?
indifferent.
get with it.
millions of galaxies
of hundreds of millions of stars
and a speck on one in a blink.
that's us. lost in space.
the cop, you, me...
who notices?
what's with you?
as in?
as in if somebody had
a gun to your head and said:
"you got to tell me what's going on
with this person over here or i'll kill you.
what is driving him?
what was he thinking?"
you know, you couldn't do it,
could you, because...
...they'd have to kill your ass
because you don't know
what anyone else is thinking.
i think you're low, my brother.
way low.
like, what were you? one of those
institutionalized raised guys?
anybody home?
the standard parts that are supposed
to be there in people, in you...
...aren't.
and why haven't you killed me yet?
of all the cabbies in l.a. i get max:
sigmund freud meets dr. ruth.
answer the question.
look in the mirror.
paper towels, clean cab,
limo company someday.
- how much you got saved?
- that ain't none of your business.
someday? someday my dream will come?
one night you'll wake up and you'll
discover it never happened.
it's all turned around on you.
it never will. suddenly you are old.
didn't happen. and it never will because
you were never going to do it anyway.
you'll push it into memory,
then zone out in your barcalounger,
being hypnotized by daytime tv
for the rest of your life.
don't you talk to me about murder.
all it ever took was a down payment
on a lincoln town car.
or that girl.
you can't even call that girl.
what the fuck are you still doing
driving a cab?
because i never straightened up
and looked at it, you know?
myself. i should have.
i tried to gamble my way out from under,
but that was just a born-to-lose deal.
- slow down.
- it's got to be perfect.
it's got to be perfect to go.
risk all torqued down.
i could've done it
anytime i wanted to.
red light.
but you know what? new news.
it doesn't matter anyway.
what does it matter anyway?
we're all insignificant out here
in this big-ass nowhere.
twilight zone shit.
says the badass sociopath
in my back seat.
but you know what? that's the one thing
i got to thank you for, bro.
because until now,
i never looked at it that way.
what does it matter?
it don't, so fuck it. fix it.
what do we got to lose anyway, right?
slow down.
why? you going to pull the trigger
and kill us?
- go ahead, shoot my ass.
- slow the hell down.
you going to shoot me now?
you going to kill us?
well, shoot my ass then.
shoot me.
- slow down!
- you're right.
you know what, vincent?
go fuck yourself!
- [coughing]
- [car hissing]
well, that was brilliant.
