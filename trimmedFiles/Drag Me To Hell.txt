i think we can make this work. i'll call
you this afternoon and let you know.
- thank you so much.
- thank you.
- you're welcome.
- thank you.
- thank you.
- have a great day.
- yeah, you, too. have a good day.
- okay.
- thank you.
- bye.
- here you go, mr. jacks.
- thank you.
mr. jacks?
i was wondering if you'd made any decision
regarding the assistant manager's position.
well, i'm still deciding, and right
now, it's between stu and yourself.
stu rubin, the new guy?
well, i know he's new, but he's also
quite aggressive, and we like that.
you know, stu's someone who's not
afraid to crunch the numbers
and make the tough decisions.
i'm perfectly capable of
making the tough decisions.
i'll let you know as
soon as i decide. okay?
in the meantime, take him through
our loan qualifying procedures,
just in case, all right?
okay.
and would you mind taking
your lunch break now?
sure.
and maybe on your way back, you
could pick me up a turkey club?
turkey club, excellent choice! you
mind picking one up for me? thanks.
and spicy mustard.
- what have you got?
- could i get your approval on this?
- this is the loan we talked about before.
- the loan.
exactly.
- good one, huh?
- one-point-five?
absolutely, and it'll
be one of many.
well, professor, congratulations on
making it through your first week.
thank you very much. mmm.
- i thought you'd have a full beard by now.
- so did i. i'm a little disappointed.
man, this thing. that's it.
i'm done. i'm out.
chris, don't even bother.
i gotta get a new one.
i'm telling you, you're gonna drive
yourself nuts. it's completely
broken.
- was broken.
- you are cocky and sexy and unbelievable.
i almost forgot. found
it at the bank.
what is this?
no way! wow. it's a 1929 standing
liberty, and it's almost fully struck.
you found this in regular
circulation at the bank?
i did.
i'm gonna add this to my
nerdy coin collection.
- thank you, baby.
- okay.
thanks for thinking of me.
- all right. bye.
- bye.
- see you later.
- i'll see you later, okay?
- dr dalton.
- <i>hello, dear.</i>
- hi, mom.
- <i>what are you doing?</i>
christine just came over
and brought some lunch,
- and i'm correcting some papers.
- <i>christine? the one from the farm?</i>
yeah, mom, the girl i've been
dating for almost a year,
the girl who's coming for dinner.
we're still on for dinner?
- <i>i'm sure she's a very sweet girl.</i>
- she is. i can't wait for you...
<i>but you know your father and i just
have certain expectations for you</i>.
- i can't really do the expectations...
- <i>i understand amy kulick is looking</i>
- <i>for someone to play tennis with</i>.
- yeah, i...
<i>you know, she graduated
from yale law with honours,</i>
<i>and she's a very
successful attorney now.</i>
- i know. you told me.
- <i>yeah, that's the kind of girl.</i>
- <i>i would love to see you with.</i>
- mother...
<i>she's the kind of woman who
could really help you socially</i>
<i>and, as a result,
in your career.</i>
<i>and that's the kind of thing you
should be thinking about now</i>.
- mother, i don't wanna...
- <i>you can't be playing around</i>
<i>with little girls
off the farm.</i>
i think you're really gonna... i
think you're really gonna like...
<i>it's time to really
find a partner.</i>
christine, you
messed up my order.
- no, i didn't.
- yeah, i said no mayo.
you never said that.
you know what? don't sweat it.
it's okay.
mr. jacks, by the way,
aren't you a laker fan?
i am a laker fan.
my mom is having this thing on sunday.
i can't use these.
- are you serious?
- yeah. absolutely. you want them?
- these are great seats!
- they are great seats.
this is where they bring
the hot dogs right to you.
yes, it is. you are gonna
hobnob with celebs.
- you sure that's okay?
- absolutely, it's okay. yeah.
- well, thank you, stu.
- take them. absolutely.
- wow.
- say hey to kobe for me.
of course.
will you help me?
of course. what
can i do for you?
your trucks are at my house. the
men are packing all my things,
private things. please,
make them stop.
- mrs...
- ganush.
mrs. ganush, the bank
is informing you
of their intent to repossess your
property at 325 brandon street today.
but this is my
home for 30 years.
and i make every payment until
the sickness took my eye.
i hope to have more money soon. i
just need a little more time. you...
i don't think my manager's going
to extend you any more credit.
please. won't you try?
- okay.
- bless you.
bless you!
we have an elderly
woman asking
for an extension on
her mortgage payment.
she's on a fixed income, and
she's had some medical problems.
there's gotta be something
we can do to help her.
well, apparently, we've already
granted her two extensions.
and, you know, on this type of
foreclosure, we seize the trapped equity
and the bank makes a
sizable amount in fees.
we would have to throw
her out of her house.
it's a tough decision.
your call.
i'll take care of it.
mrs. ganush. i'm
sorry, mrs. ganush,
but another extension on the
loan is out of the question.
- what? - i would like to help,
but it is in the bank's...
no, please, this is my home.
where will i live?
you list your granddaughter as a reference.
maybe you could stay with her.
i would not burden her.
and there are several fine assisted
living facilities for the elderly...
a nursing home? no, i would never
live in one of those places.
i'm really sorry.
i am proud woman, miss brown,
and never have i
begged for anything.
but now, i beg for you.
- i humble myself before you.
- mrs. ganush. mrs. ganush, please.
- please stand up.
- i, sylvia ganush, beg.
on my mother's grave, i beg you!
please let go. let go!
security! stop!
- over here, billy! over here!
- we're coming.
you shame me.
i beg you, and you shame me.
i think your business is
finished here, ma'am.
let's go.
mrs. ganush...
get out of here!
- come on, ma'am.
- let's go.
i never saw anything
quite like that before.
are you okay?
you handled that just
right, you know.
- good night. see you tomorrow.
- okay.
you know, i just finished going
over this mcpherson loan.
- this is very impressive work.
- thanks.
would you mind taking this home
tonight and finishing it up?
because i would like to show it to
the regional veep in the morning.
- i would love to.
- great.
thank you.
and as far as that assistant
manager's position goes,
you're at the top of the list.
you shamed me.
i beat you, you old bitch!
no!
lamia.
soon it will be you who
comes begging to me.
- she's right over there.
- thank you, thank you.
hey!
once they send some officers
over to have a talk with her,
she's not gonna be bothering
you any more, okay?
so don't even think about her.
and i'm gonna call mr
jacks and just make sure
he can have somebody walk you
to your car every night, okay?
okay.
i just thank god you're okay.
you are okay, right?
i'm fine.
what? what's the matter?
it's just that maybe i could have gotten
her another extension on her loan.
chris, no, don't do that.
you said the bank granted this woman
two extensions already, right?
i'm sorry, if you don't pay your
mortgage, you lose your house.
what does this woman expect?
it's not your fault.
you can't beat
yourself up over it.
i mean, what'd she expect?
it's not your fault.
and regardless of what you may
or may not have been able to do,
that's still no
justification for her...
what is it? what's wrong?
- did you hear that?
- what?
really? you didn't?
no. what?
i know this is gonna sound weird,
but i wanna get my fortune read.
now? are you kidding?
come on, chris. i'll read
your fortune for you.
in the near future, we are
gonna get in the car,
- go home and relax.
- clay, i really want to do this.
why? because of what happened
with that old woman?
chris, i really think we
should just get you home now.
can you do this for me?
i pray to god none of my
students see me here.
the only class i'll be able to
teach is, like, hypocrisy 101.
yeah, there's so many
things to choose from here.
unfortunately, not what i'm looking for,
which is a weird little dried monkey head.
wait, no, never
mind, he's got one.
i am rham jas, seer.
i'm christine
and this is clay.
but you probably already
knew that, right?
- just kidding.
- how can i help you?
i would like to have my fortune read.
can you do that?
i have the ability to
see certain energies.
sometimes these energies are a
foretoken of things to come.
$60, please.
- seriously?
- yes.
sixty... doesn't that seem a little
steep for this sort of thing?
- if you're not serious, please go.
- all right. come on, chris.
wait, wait! i'll... i'll pay.
no, you know what? you know what?
i got it. i got it.
- there you go.
- platinum card. very good.
thank you.
- here, here, baby.
- thanks.
sure.
uh-uh. please.
okay.
so, you wish to know
something of your destiny.
- yes.
- very good.
let's see what the
fates have in store.
you know, freud said destiny
was not an act of fate,
but rather something created
by our subconscious
to control our
conscious choices.
that's true. but we cannot attempt to
understand the world by intellect alone.
- carl jung.
- yes.
from his treatise
<i>psychological types.</i>
so...
jung, the new agers'
favourite psychologist.
because he wasn't afraid to
bring god into the equation.
well, he wasn't afraid
to bring god into...
clay, clay, come on.
let's do it. i know. come on.
let's start.
- shall we?
- i'm ready.
very well. please,
give me your hand.
okay.
this way. okay.
you work with money.
that's right.
and you've recently
lost something.
- no, i don't think so.
- no. no, you haven't lost anything.
but something's been
taken from you.
no.
- a button.
- oh, my god. yes!
well, anyone can see she's
missing a button! so what?
but, clay, it was
really strange.
the old woman today, she took
a button from my sleeve.
- why would she do that?
- if you would both please just be quiet!
- i think that's enough for tonight.
- what's wrong?
i'm tired, and i see
it's become quite late.
i will, of course,
refund your money.
wait, wait, wait! did
you see something?
a dark spirit has come upon you.
- what do you mean?
- well, he's...
did you blaspheme the dead
while visiting a graveyard?
- no!
- did you play with a ouija board
or consort with those who
practise the black arts?
all right, take it easy, man.
come on.
wait. clay, clay, clay.
no. no, i didn't.
perhaps someone has cursed you.
- then how did he know all that?
- know what? that you lost a button?
and by the way, he didn't
really know that much.
he makes a couple of
good guesses, then he...
he stirs you up, and then he leaves
you with all these questions
and, conveniently,
his business card.
come on, chris,
he's a scam artist.
but he didn't want the money. he
tried to give it back, remember?
well, he sort of tried, but in
the end, he took it, didn't he?
i guess so.
i gotta go meet the guy
that's towing your car,
so you gonna be okay?
- yeah.
- all right. kitty, take care of her.
- i'll see you in about an hour. love you.
- okay.
okay.
damn it.
- here. put that on your lip.
- thank you.
i can't believe she came to the house.
this is so nuts. i'm calling the cops.
- it wasn't her.
- who was it then?
- i don't know. i couldn't see who it was.
- of course it was her. it had to be her.
no, clay, it wasn't anyone!
it was somebody. chris,
it had to be somebody.
the lights were out. you just
couldn't see who it was,
- but i'm guessing it was...
- clay, there wasn't anybody here.
then who did this?
who hit you in the face?
huh?
i think it's just a reaction to her
being attacked earlier in the day.
yeah. classic symptoms of
post-traumatic stress.
yeah, she's showing signs of
panic and paranoia. so...
- do you want me to walk you out, man?
- no, no, no, i'll be fine.
all right.
hey, hey.
how you doing?
- better.
- yeah?
especially after the
doctor explained it to me.
he said that victims
of violence,
- they re-experience.<i>..</i>
- re-experience their trauma.
i misinterpreted it to be
something more than it was.
- happens.
- i just... i feel...
- what?
- kind of embarrassed.
are you kidding? no. you never
have to be embarrassed with me.
okay?
hey, listen, i was thinking maybe we
could take a little trip on saturday,
- get on the train and go to santa barbara.
- your folks' cabin.
yeah, if you're up
for it, the cabin.
- oh, my god, i would love to!
- yeah? good.
- that'd be so exciting.
- baby, you're gonna love it.
- you're gonna love it.
- okay, good.
i'm excited for you to see it.
- there's trees and it's private.
- that would be great.
it'll be great. it'll be good.
i think we need to. and we can just...
we can just talk and stuff.
what?
- what's the matter?
- i couldn't... i couldn't wake up.
it's okay. okay. come here.
it was just a dream.
baby, that's the rental car
they dropped off this morning.
- okay? sure.
- thanks.
- love you.
- love you, too.
hey, baby, try not to piss off
any old ladies today, okay?
hey, christine?
- what, are you just getting here?
- what are you, the hall monitor?
ha, ha. very funny, christine.
what's this?
what do you want?
i need you to finish teaching
me the loan procedures.
i've got a lot on my mind.
can we do this tomorrow?
- sure.
- okay.
i'll just tell mr. jacks that you
don't have the time right now.
- maybe he can tell me.
- no, no! okay, i'll do it.
okay.
we were going over the
asset-based lending guidelines.
right. let's say your client is a company
that can't get traditional bank financing.
- and?
- and.<i>..</i>
and?
and...
and get your filthy pig
knuckle off my desk!
christine blood... brown.
christine. your nose.
sure, can you hold?
- let me help you.
- no, no, i've got it under control.
oh, my god! oh, my god!
god! oh, my god! stop it!
mr. jacks!
- did i get any in my mouth?
- oh, my god!
- did i get any in my mouth?
- let me take you over here to get clean.
i'm so sorry! oh, my god!
- what was that about?
- it's just a nosebleed.
- did i get any in my mouth?
- we'll clean you up. we have antiseptic.
what is it?
hi. i came to see sylvia ganush.
is she here?
who are you?
i'm a friend of hers.
- someone...
- wait.
i know who you are. grandma
told me you would come.
you are the woman from the bank,
the one who took her house.
actually, it was the bank
that took the house.
i mean, i just work there.
in fact, i tried to help your
grandma get the house back,
but my boss wouldn't let me.
are you going to stand here on
my porch and lie to my face?
no.
you used to be a real
fat girl, didn't you?
- yeah.
- i can tell.
you are not welcome here.
wait! wait. i need to see her.
i need her to forgive me. and
i'll get her the house back.
and you are gonna make everything
all right for her, is that it?
yes.
come on.
where is she?
- get her off me! get her off me!
- come! don't look.
- grab her shoulder.
- be a man! lift her up!
- be careful.
- let's roll the dice!
still going to make
everything all right for her?
you deserve everything
that is coming to you.
one more time!
i believe what plagues
you is the lamia.
lamia, that's the word
the old woman used.
the black goat, only summoned by
gypsies for their darkest deeds.
for the first three days, the lamia appears
as a nasty spirit that torments its victim.
after that, it reveals itself
to be a taker of souls,
and it comes for the owner
of the accursed object.
accursed object. what object?
something taken from the
victim, cursed and given back.
this?
what if i just burn it?
i'm afraid no matter what
condition the button is in,
you would still be the owner. the
lamia would still come to take you.
take me where?
- then how do i get rid of this?
- you could attempt to appease the spirit.
the simplest way would
be a blood offering.
a small creature could be
sacrificed, a chicken perhaps.
no way! look, i'm a vegetarian.
i volunteer at the puppy
shelter, for christ's sake.
i don't go around
killing animals.
you will be surprised what
you'll be willing to do
when the lamia comes for you.
this will show you how.
hi!
here, kitty, kitty.
chris! chris?
chris?
hey, there you are. what
are you doing out here?
baby, i called the bank.
they said you left early.
you're not answering my calls.
is that blood?
no. why would there be blood?
yeah, baby, there's... there's
blood on your sleeve.
- are you bleeding?
- no.
it was just tomato juice.
i was cutting a tomato in the kitchen
and it must have gotten on my sleeve.
hey, chris, why don't we do
this dinner another time?
you've had a rough couple of days.
i think it's better.
no, i want to go to the dinner.
i know, but are you sure
you're feeling all right?
honestly, i haven't been.
but i think...
i think that everything
is gonna be okay now.
i really do.
what do you think?
you look beautiful.
- god, it's such a nice day!
- it really is. my god.
it's gonna be nice inside, too.
they're gonna love you.
- clayton.
- hello, mother.
good to see you.
this is christine.
- that's my mom, trudy.
- hello, christine.
hello. it's very
nice to meet you.
- well.
- please, come in. come in.
yes.
- hey, dad, how are you?
- hey, son.
good to see you, sir.
this is christine. christine,
this is my dad, leonard.
- nice to meet you.
- hi, maria. thank you.
- you have a beautiful home.
- well, thank you very much.
- can i get you a drink?
- yeah, wine?
- do you guys want?
- sure.
- okay. come help me.
- i'll be right back.
- i'll take a chardonnay!
- yes, dear.
- i hope you don't mind.
- how thoughtful.
- homemade?
- yes.
and what type of cake
would you call that?
it's called
a harvest cake.
is that something you
would make on a farm?
no.
i mean, not any more. we used to
when we had a gaggle of geese.
- geese?
- well, right around the harvest time,
that's when your goose eggs
will make a real dense yolk.
it makes for a rich cake.
well, just thank you.
- here we are.
- sorry to interrupt the bonding sesh.
- why don't you join us in the dining room?
- good.
- yeah, let's go. it's right in here.
- okay.
- jeez.
- hecuba.
i never did understand that damned animal.
i hate cats.
that is so strange. hecuba
is usually very sweet.
that's okay. i had a cat.
i understand.
you mean... you mean
you have a cat.
what do you mean? did
something happen?
unless something
happened to him.
well, how am i supposed to know?
i mean, you know how cats are.
they come and they go.
that's true.
- well, should...
- well... yes. yes, please.
so, how's the coin
collection, son?
that's my dad's way of saying,
"so, you're still a huge nerd?"
it's good. it's good. in
fact, christine just got me
a 1929 standing liberty
quarter at her bank.
- really?
- isn't that crazy? yeah, it's rare.
i just think the job of a bank
teller must be so difficult,
with all that counting and repetition.
it must get very tedious.
yes, you're right,
- but i'm not a teller.
- oh?
yeah, mom, i told you.
christine's a loan officer.
she handles all the loans for small
businesses and homes for her bank.
and she's up for this big promotion, so...
right, chris?
if i could close this one account that
i'm working on, it would really help.
that must be a very
important loan.
it's the biggest that my
branch has ever handled.
and how did that come to you?
well, i was reading the
<i>wall street journal</i>
and came across this
medical supply company
that was looking to expand but
didn't have the liquidity.
so i met with their cfo
and presented a formula
for restructuring some
of their long-term debt.
sounds like you've got a lot
going for you, christine.
well, your mother must
be very proud of you.
i suppose.
i don't see much of my mother.
why is that?
wow, mom, that's...
it's kind of personal.
i'm speaking to christine.
well, ever since my dad died,
she doesn't talk much.
she just stays on the farm and
keeps to herself because...
because?
because her husband died, mom, and
she just wants to be by herself.
- why don't...
- because my mother's an alcoholic.
oh.
i'm sorry.
it's certainly nothing
to be ashamed of.
i have to say, i find your
honesty very refreshing.
my father had a drinking problem, and
i was always too ashamed to admit it.
you've got backbone.
unlike that last
girl he brought by.
- what was her name?
- alice.
- we don't have to...
- alicia!
- alicia.
- she was dreadful, christine.
she was ill-mannered,
no ambition at all.
- that's not really...
- they met on the internet.
- there you go.
- what is that,
- "they met on the internet"?
- really?
- what does that mean?
- am i being too hard on him?
no, not at all.
- there you go. thank you very much.
- thanks a lot...
you know, i think i will try
some of that cake of yours.
...for tossing me under the bus.
- look at that. it looks great.
- you're gonna like it.
- it looks so interesting.
you only dislike it if you
hate delicious things.
- well, that counts us out.
- not my problem.
lovely.
thank you, christine.
this is wonderful.
it also changed the
subject nicely.
thank you. that looks good!
- harvest cake, huh?
- that's right.
- we'll have to get this recipe.
- it sounds so quaint, doesn't it?
did you hear something?
no. you okay?
tasty!
- i like it a lot.
- i do like it.
you know, mom, when you say we met on
the internet, it's a little misleading.
yes, well you need to do
that to find a good mate.
- she has a facebook...
- you can't even trust
the things you hear or that
people write about themselves.
very nice.
even the pictures are
false half the time.
- isn't that true?
- it's true.
- it doesn't really count.
- i don't think it's a misconception
to think that people
of good breeding
and success should be
able to meet potential
life partners in a
realistic situation.
well, you also have
a thing about bars.
would you, christine?
- no. no, of course not.
- what? what... but we did.
we met at a bar, chris.
what are you talking about?
- oh, my god, that's right!
- she...
- you two better get your stories straight.
- it's not a klan rally, mom. it's a bar.
yeah, we met... we met at a bar, and
we set up the date on the internet.
you okay? you okay?
some water? baby, have some...
went down the wrong pipe.
oh, my god!
i'm sorry, i don't... there
must be a window open.
chris?
okay, i hear you!
- what in the hell?
- leave me alone.
- just leave me the hell alone!
- hey! hey! chris! stop it!
baby! there's no one there.
okay.
- i think i'd better go.
- yes, i think that would be best.
- i know. wait, chris...
- don't follow her! she's a sick girl.
- mom, she needs my help.
- let her go.
wait!
what's the matter?
look, i did what you said! i
killed that little kitty!
you're so full of shit!
these are elusive and powerful
forces we are dealing with.
there are no guarantees.
we must speak directly
to this dark spirit.
we must dissuade it from
taking your soul, and soon.
- i know someone who can help us.
- and i'm supposed to trust you?
tomorrow is the third day. after
that, the lamia will come for you.
we can't let that happen.
but you must understand,
the woman who can help us must
put herself at great risk.
- she will not do that for free.
- what do you need from me?
$10,000 cash
by tomorrow.
- mr. jacks.
- yeah?
this is kind of awkward for me,
and i know it's not official yet,
but i was wondering if i could get
an advance for the new position.
what, the assistant
manager's position?
yes. see, one of my family
members is really sick.
- they're not gonna die, but they could.
- christine. christine.
there's a problem. the mcpherson
deal was cancelled last night.
- what?
- yeah.
right after i informed the regional
office that we had this big loan pending,
i find out that they just made
their deal over at first national.
now, i gotta call in to see
what exactly happened,
but right now, this does not
look too good for you or for me.
so, this assistant manager
promotion has been delayed.
in fact, you know, i think, with
everything that's been happening,
i think i'm gonna have
to give this job to stu.
stu. i see.
i'm sorry. look, if you've
got family problems,
maybe you should take the day
off, sort them out and...
- so, how much?
- $3,800 for everything.
- including my jewellery?
- including.
but this stuff is worth
so much more than that.
please. this is all i have.
i'm begging you.
take it or leave it.
chris? chris?
baby?
i thought you were
lactose intolerant.
i am.
but then i thought, "screw
it, i'm eating ice cream."
i paid rham jas.
what? you're kidding me.
i paid him.
why? i mean, i thought
that you didn't believe.
i don't know what i
believe in any more.
i really don't, but i know
that you believe in this.
i know how important
it is to you,
and i know how much pain
this is causing you.
and, i also remembered...
i remembered a
promise that i made
the night i fell
in love with you.
i told myself that i would...
i would always look out for you.
i'd always take care of you.
so i paid him.
you remember the night that
you fell in love with me?
i remember the second i
fell in love with you.
oh, my god.
you sure you don't want
me to go in with you?
he said i should come alone.
yeah, i know, i know he did.
he told me the same thing.
christine, if you will permit me
the pleasure of an
introduction, shaun san dena.
- welcome.
- how do you do?
shaun san dena is an
experienced medium.
furthermore, she's personally
been touched by the lamia.
i first encountered this spirit
many years ago in this very house.
and what happened?
i lost a young boy's
soul to the beast.
i have waited these long years
for a chance at
redeeming myself,
a chance to destroy
the foul thing.
- and...
- <i>tetièko,</i> please.
tonight, my chance will come.
but to summon it, i
will need your help.
can you be strong?
i'll try.
my late husband, sandor,
was also medium.
he chose this site to
build a house upon
because he sensed certain
forces at work here.
in this place, there
is a particular...
a particular
confluence of forces
which allows a doorway to be opened
through which we may pass...
...and through which others
may pass into our world.
please be seated.
what's going on?
everything we're doing
is for your own good.
please. christine, please.
thank you.
once the spirit has entered me,
put my hand upon the animal.
- do you understand?
- yes.
i force the spirit of the
lamia into the goat.
milos, that's when you strike.
i understand.
we all must be receptive.
- what am i supposed to do?
- you must allow the darkness in.
you must invite the dead to
co-mingle with your spirit.
- i'm scared.
- yes.
now repeat these words, "i
welcome the dead into my soul."
- i welcome the dead into my soul.
- you must believe it!
i welcome the dead into my soul.
- i welcome the dead into my soul.
- i welcome the dead into my soul.
- i welcome the dead into my soul.
...lnto my soul.
i welcome the dead into my soul.
i welcome the dead into my soul.
i welcome the dead into my soul.
i welcome the dead...
i welcome the dead into my soul.
i welcome the dead into...
something else is here with us.
yes.
this is not the lamia.
it is the spirit of some
unsettled soul from years ago.
sometimes the unsettled
ones linger by the door.
there are others here, as well.
begone, foolish spirits! begone!
she is coming.
who now inhabits the
body of shaun san dena?
lamia!
lamia, what is it you desire?
i desire the soul
of christine brown!
we will feast upon it as
she festers in the grave!
no! it was my
manager, jim jacks!
- he was the one! he was...
- silence!
lamia, surely you can be dissuaded
from taking this insignificant woman.
surely she is not worthy
of your greatness.
no!
i come for you, christine.
you're mine!
no!
you tricked me! you
black-hearted whore!
- now, milos, now!
- you bitch.
away, unclean spirit.
lamia!
as one who summoned you to this circle,
i command you to leave this instant.
christine!
i don't want your cat,
you dirty pork queen!
shaun san dena!
you must banish the spirit!
yes!
milos!
- oh, my god. i'm okay.
- thank god!
- i'm okay.
- unbelievable!
- you did it!
- thank god.
i tried.
are you okay?
oh, my god. help me!
call an ambulance.
is she breathing?
no.
oh, my gosh.
- it's so sad.
- yes.
strange how things work out.
she waited 40 years for another
chance to overcome the lamia,
and finally, on the last
night of her life, she did.
no, i'm afraid you
misunderstand.
the lamia cannot be
banished by a medium.
this is our lesson tonight.
i'm sorry.
- but i saw her get rid of the thing.
- no.
you saw her drive it from a séance.
that is all.
it will be back. the goat
was never slaughtered.
when this night is through,
the lamia will come for the
owner of the accursed object.
unless, of course, you
are no longer the owner.
do you have the button?
make a gift of it and you've
given the curse away.
why didn't you tell
me this before?
because the lamia will tear the soul
out of whoever you give that to.
they'll burn in
hell for eternity.
and i would have
sent them there.
and i would be your accomplice.
whatever you decide,
you have till morning.
is it over?
it's over.
clay!
you will burn in hell!
you will burn in hell! you
bitch, you'll burn in hell!
your turn's coming!
- you will burn in hell!
- you okay?
holy shit.
okay, you sure you're still okay
about the santa barbara trip?
- yeah, i'm fine.
- yeah?
- and what time should i get you?
- it's better if i meet you at the station.
there's something i've
gotta do on the way.
i can do it. you want me
to do it on my way to...
no! no. i've got
it under control.
we'll meet at, like, 7:30 at the...
wait! where's my envelope?
- what envelope?
- it was in my purse. i just had it!
- it's just an envelope.
- no, it's gotta be here!
it's here, so we'll
find it eventually.
- oh, my god.
- okay.
i thought i'd lost it. okay.
bye. 7:30. don't be late.
dad, can we go to
the angel game?
what about the dodgers?
we're only gonna be
in town for a few days.
i'm sure if i just tell him
how much i care about you,
i mean, he's gotta understand.
are you sure you don't
want anything else?
no.
so you're just gonna sit here
drinking coffee all night long.
yes. maybe! what's it to you?
honey, i make my money on tips.
coffee drinkers don't tip.
honey, just keep the coffee coming or
i'll give you a tip you won't forget.
oh, my gosh. what a
delightful surprise.
you're the sweetest
person in the world.
never mind what it's about, stu.
just get here in 10 minutes
or i'm gonna tell mr. jacks
something you don't
want me to tell him.
<i>oh, yeah? like what?</i>
well, for starters, that you stole
the mcpherson loan file off my desk
and gave it to first national.
now you got nine minutes!
- give me another.
- seriously?
oh, god, christine,
please don't tell on me.
i mean, if my dad
ever finds out...
- just tell me what you want.
- i need to give something to you.
- a little gift.
- a gift?
but i don't understand. i
thought you called me down here
because i gave that loan
to first national...
look, you don't need to understand.
just shut up!
now, this gift that i'm giving
you, it'll become your property.
you'll be the owner, all right?
okay.
okay.
what?
forget it.
but i thought you wanted to give
it to me 'cause of the loan stuff.
just leave.
okay. thank you so
much, christine.
- but you're not gonna tell my dad, right?
- go!
okay.
who does deserve this?
well? is it possible?
there are gypsy blessings
bestowed upon the dead.
they give gifts
to their departed
to curry favour with the deceased's
soul, for, truly, the soul never dies.
yes. i do believe you can give the
curse to someone who has passed on,
<i>but you must make a formal gift of
the accursed object to the deceased</i>.
i'll do better than that. i'll
shove it down her goddamn throat!
i'm gonna get some...
i'm giving it back to you!
you're gonna take this thing.
are you gonna take this thing?
take it!
that's the last of my
hair you're getting!
i, christine brown, do hereby
make a formal gift of this button
to you, sylvia ganush!
choke on it, bitch!
goodbye.
<i>hi, it's christine. leave a
message and i'll call you back.</i>
<i>christine, it's
jim, jim jacks</i>.
<i>i'm sorry i'm
calling so early,</i>
<i>but last night, i found some troubling
information about our friend stu rubin.</i>
<i>apparently, he stole your
file on the mcpherson loan</i>
<i>and then tried to broker his
own deal at first national.</i>
<i>i guess he thought we
wouldn't find out.</i>
<i>and we wouldn't have either,
except that an hour ago,</i>
<i>he came by my house and tried
to pin the whole thing on you</i>.
<i>after i confronted him about a few
inconsistencies in his story,</i>
<i>he broke down crying and, well, we
won't be seeing him around any more</i>.
<i>so i just wanted you to know
that, come monday morning</i>,
<i>that assistant manager's position
will be waiting for you</i>.
<i>passenger benson,
please meet your party</i>
<i>at the concourse
ticket counter.</i>
- <i>welcome to union station.</i>
- cookie, miss?
- no, thanks.
- <i>we appreciate you choosing</i>
<i>train travel as your
mode of transportation,</i>
<i>and we wish you a
pleasant journey</i>.
hi. good morning.
- i'm sorry, we're not open.
- i just... i just want this coat.
we're not open yet.
my boyfriend and i are taking this
really special trip this morning.
please?
<i>northbound surf liner,
service to van nuys,</i>
<i>simi valley, oxnard,
santa barbara,</i>
- <i>san luis obispo...</i>
- clay?
- hey!
- hey! oh, man! hi.
god, i'm so glad you're here. so
many things i wanna tell you.
wait, there's
something i wanna say
- while i have it straight in my head.
- okay. go ahead.
you never stopped
believing in me.
thank you for that.
and there's something else, something
that i couldn't admit to before.
i could have given mrs. ganush another
extension on her loan, but i didn't.
it was my decision, and
it was wrong of me.
you have such a good heart.
you're so beautiful right now.
- do you like my new coat?
- i do. i really do.
- what happened to the old one, though?
- i threw it out.
- and i never want to see it again.
- oh, no.
that's too bad, because i...
look what i found.
i found this in the car.
i thought...
and i thought maybe you could...
i thought maybe you
could sew it back on.
and i think you might have
my standing liberty quarter,
'cause the envelopes
kind of look the same.
chris, what's wrong?
- oh, my god!
- hey! hey, hey, hey!
- oh, god.
- hey, hey. hey! hey!
stop! chris! oh, god!
hey! hey! hey, hey, no!
hey! oh, god, no!
hey, no!
help me!
help me!
help me!
help me, please!
