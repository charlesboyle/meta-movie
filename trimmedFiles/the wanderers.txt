hey, are you gonna make me,
motherfucker? come on, let's go!
all right, settle down.
you've both have detention.

i can't write that fast.
okay, is that it? that's all?
we ran out of names
pretty fast, didn't we?
okay, what did we learn here today?
mr. sharp, the white boys
forgot a couple of names.
they forgot spades, spooks and jigs.
- yeah, jig is good.
- put that on the board.
how did you guys forget those names?
there must have been a
mental lapse, mr. sharp.
i think it's because they are a bunch of
dumb-ass, grease ball, guinea, wop...
you fucking black bastard!
fuck you, dago motherfucker!
- jigaboo!
- your mama!
- you ain't got one.
- fuck you!

well, richie,
no nigger will face this.
what are you doing with that?
we don't need those, man. put it away.
you kidding me, man?
those guys will show up with pieces.
don't trust them.
you got to go for them first.
man, he got a point, richie.
hey, listen, me and clinton agreed.
no guns or knives.
you gonna trust that nigger?
you don't know where you're living.
you talking last year. we ain't
going with you without these.
then you ain't going with us.
nice knowing you guys.
let's beat it.
have fun.
- motherfucking pussies.
- i don't know, man.
- come on, let's go.
- come on.
hey, look, richie,
i call my friends in the baldies.
- knock it off!
- hands off me, joey!
- come on, left.
- those guys like me.
call 'em, i think they'll come in with us.
with them in, it's all over.
listen, i ain't calling
those guys. i got my pride.
yes, sometimes all you got is pride.
got to hold your head up high.
i seen this movie once where this
guy was being tortured by the japs
but he wouldn't give
them any information.
every time they tortured him he started
singing the star-spangled banner.
wow.
what happened?
- they killed him.
- shut up, you're depressing me.
- what was that?
- none, man, you got the jitters.
- i'm going to take a whiz.
- i thought i heard something.
- you guys hear anything?
- no.
baldies got guys, too.
it's the wongs!
hey, teddy wong. how you doing?
- i thought you was coming earlier.
- we did come earlier, man.
we waited until now to
make ourselves known.
which is been hanging out
in the bushes out here?
- it's pretty spooky.
- we've been listening.
listen, i called you wongs
here tonight for a reason.
- we know your reason.
- gonna join us?
no.
you're gonna join them?
stay back! don't fuck with the wongs.
no, the wongs never
joined with anybody.
yet.
what do you mean by 'yet'?
we'll decide what's right
when the time comes.
the wongs will wait and see.
- when what time comes?
- what do they mean?
- where did they go?
- i don't know.
get back here!
no, get the fuck out of here,
you chink assholes.
- are you nuts?
- no sweat, they can't hear me.
don't fuck with the wongs!
shit.
richie, listen to what i just heard.
it ain't just the del bombers, man.
they're bringing in the pips,
the cavaliers and the mau maus.
shit, we've got a fucking
race war on our heads.
who we gonna get?
maybe we'll bring in some guys
the golden guineas or the dusters.
but one thing: we got to stay cool.
hey, did you notice those spades got
two million cousins all over the country?
we need help, and i'm calling
my friends in, the baldies.
are you nuts, man? forget it.
guess who.
al capone.
no, it's me.
what do you know.
- what are you doing, richie?
- nothing.
what's that list?
you're gonna rumble?
no, it's just some business.
listen, i'll talk to you later, all right?
i thought we were gonna
buy some records.
yeah, maybe a little later, all right?
i love you, baby.
love you, too.
- oh, richie?
- yeah?
my daddy wants to see you.
yo, peppy dio, how you doing?
listen, i heard chubby
is looking for me.
right over there.
over here, richie.
you wanted to see me, mr. galasso?
yeah. me and my brothers wanted
to see you because we heard you...
maybe got some trouble
with the colored.
how did you hear about that?
how did we hear about that?
how do the galasso brothers hear
about anything in this neighborhood?
the reason i'm asking is that
maybe you could use some help.
no, we can handle it.
just remember, richie,
in this day and age, in this
neighborhood, there's lots of ways...
to skin the cat.
you know what i mean?
not exactly.
think about it.
you know where to find us.
these guys wanted joey to come
so he could heal old wounds.
i respect these guys. give 'em
a good rumble, they're happy.
hey, look what's coming.
look what the cat dragged in.
joey, my favorite wanderer, man.
you know, joey, if i had a
dog with a face like yours...
i'd shave its ass and
teach it to walk backwards.
very funny, terror. very funny.
hey, terror, we've come to you because
we've got problems with the niggers.
you guys know roger, don't you?
what do you mothers want?
we've got some personal
business here.
you guys go to
tulley high, don't you?
- yeah.
- yeah, sure.
maybe you know a cousin of mine.
clinton stitch?
- one of the del bombers.
- yeah.
sure, clinton stitch. i know him.
it's a good friend of mine.
- you know clinton, don't you?
- yeah, sure, we know clinton.
- everybody knows clinton.
- you know,
i think we can talk
business better in the park.
- is this a joke?
- sure, it's a joke.
- just like yours about pricks with ears.
- take it easy, will you?
- or was it ears without pricks?
- where are we going?
hey, terror, i knew you
wasn't chickenshit.
turkey, do me a favor, will you?
sure, terror, you know how
i feel about you guys.
hold these.
hey, we're thinking about making you
guys honorary members of the baldies.
that's great, peewee.
and we thought we might
start by shaving your heads.
come on, not my hair, all right?
too good for us?
maybe we won't take your hair off.
we'll just take something else off.
- drop your pants.
- sure, terror, whatever you want.
not you, turkey.
you're gonna help us. hop over.
why don't you guys
just shave our heads?
we got delicate feelings.
you guys seem to think
you're too good for us.
you guys are a bunch of fruits!
now, there you go again,
hurting our feelings.
tie their hands.
turkey, i want you to tie one
end of the rope right there.
jesus, terror
turkey, don't do it.
turkey, it's just a little
test to get in to the baldies.
you know, to see how
brave a guy can be.
i know these guys heard
of rock'n'roll...
but you guys ever
hear of rock'n'cock?
how about cock'n'roll, mothers?
hey, turkey, do a boy scout knot.
turkey, don't do it, man.
don't do it, turkey,
you're a wanderer.
turkey, you fucking homo.
don't get me mad, joey.
okay, turkey, pick up
both of the rocks.
you guys got any last
words to say to your dicks?
say, 'bye-bye, dick,
nice knowing you.'
turkey, throw the rocks over.
sorry, guys.
oh, shit. looks like we
got to get shorter twine.
don't you guys go away.
we'll be right back.
come on, turkey, i got a soft
spot in my heart for you.
what are we gonna do now?
can't get anybody to help us, richie.
they left us here to die of exposure.
don't fuck with the baldies!
this is just a warning.
i'm glad you've come
to us finally, richie.
you've got a good sense of reality.
we're gonna help you with
your problem with the colored.
how are you feeling today?
- the old bowling arm feeling hot?
- sure, we're always hot.
'sure, we're always hot.'
wasn't so hot last week
against those long island guys.
which reminds me, you see who's
bowling out there tonight?
no.
take a look.
shit.
it's those guys from long island.
that's right.
you know what they're
doing here tonight?
- i don't know.
- they've come here for a rematch.
mr. galasso, those guys are too good.
they killed us last week.
you know, richie,
you need some confidence.
the other kid can wait here.
you guys are gonna win big tonight.
are you kidding, peppy dio?
these guys are good enough to be pros.
my instinct is they is pros.
chubby checked up on them.
they go around to the different lanes.
they hustle the house bowlers.
they hustle the hustlers.
- they are greedy boys.
- what's chubby gonna do?
chubby got a way of
creating miracles.
what'll it be?
what's this?
- five big ones?
- we ain't got that much.
no? what do you got?
twenty-five hundred.
- twenty-five hundred.
- i guess, that'll have to do.
we'll leave the money there.
whoa, whoa, whoa, pal.
we get to pick the alley, right?
anything! come on, you guys
gonna play? let's cut the bullshit.
wanna keep score, too? go ahead.
i'm just a dumb ginny.
what do i know?
for all i know,
you guys could be pros.
what are you guys talking about?
your guys are really good,
is what we're talking about.
hey, wait a minute. what's happening?
where's everybody going?
just closing for a while,
for a little privacy.
help!
- where are you going?
- no, wait, please!
what are you doing?
you guy is so good, it wouldn't be
fair unless you bowled handicapped.
- twenty pins.
- twenty pins?
that's not what i was thinking about.
- fifty pins!
- no good.
what i had in mind
was a real handicap.
i seen this in my favorite movie.
you ever seen 'the hustler'?
good enough for paul newman,
good enough for you.
now, where was we?
oh, yeah, you guys come
to us with a problem.
we'll take care of it.
but remember, we're sportsmen.
and we're interested in
making a little bet on you.
nothing wrong with that, is there?
i understand you're playing the coloreds
in north bronx football league soon.
i think it would be to our mutual
benefit if you won one for the galassos.
- don't you?
- yeah.
you know, there's two
kinds of people.
those with common interests
and assholes like those hustlers.
what i like about these
colored sportsmen
is they got common interest.
not all your colored are assholes.
it's a shame to see kids
beating each other's brains out.
especially when there's no
financial advantage. right, albert?
- right.
- how are you?
how are you, man?
- how you doing?
- okay, you?
we're gonna have a
little football game.
a little sporting event.
i'm glad these boys here
brought us into the picture.
it gives these kids a chance to settle
their differences in a beneficial manner.
what do you say we adjourn
to the bar for a little discussion?
it's cool.
what's all this?
i'm making a banner.
our big game with the del bombers
is coming up. you should come, dad.
- both undefeated. could be a good game.
- look at me when you talk to me.
what kind of drawing you doing?
why can't you do something normal?
you know, a mountain
lake, a tree, birds.
that's art.
those aren't normal people
you draw. they're freaks.
- can't you hear me?
- emilio.
- joey, time to eat.
- they're freaks.
hey, good. i got to
drop a few pounds.
i got to get more pressed.
come on, let's eat.
look, guys, it's us against
the world, all right?
i mean, just the wanderers.
we got to stick together.
yeah. we got to stick
it to the del bombers.
joey, i got a game for you.
see who can hit the softest.
- yeah, sure.
- you can go first.
- that's pretty good. it's my turn now.
- yeah, go ahead.
jesus, what did you do that for?
i thought you said the softest.
yeah, i did. you win.
asshole!
i'm in love! look at that.
i'd like to stick it to that.
- i'm in love.
- she carries bombs, man!
hey, you know what, man?

you boys are pigs!
- you have no respect!
- i'm sorry.
lady, i'm sorry!
- you boys are pigs!
- yes, ma'am.
jesus christ, i never realized
how dangerous elbow-titting was.
hey, you win a few,
and you lose a few.
- gone by.
- don't hit me.
- you look alright.
- look at that!
hey, richie, your turn.
- no, come on, it's all over.
- come on, chickenshit.
- what is this?
- hey, come on, let's go.
- come on!
- give it a go!

buddy, come on, babe.
joey, it's so noisy down here.
do you suppose she'd mind
if we went upstairs to talk?

we're gonna go upstairs to talk.
just don't get any jizzy
marks on the galassos' bed.
i'll make you eat it
off with a spoon.
hey, good luck, joey.
richie, my daddy will kill me
if they make a mess upstairs.
they won't, don't worry about it.
you know, i think maybe we
should go upstairs, too.
i swear as a citizen
of the united states.
with this ceremony,
after signing this document,
you'll become marines...
terror, don't do it!
- of the u.s. marine corps.
- marines!
i swear that i have never been
a member of the communist party.
at least you guys don't
need no haircuts.
terror, you know what you've just done?
you've just joined the fucking marines.
you stupid baboon!
you know what i think we just done?
what?
i think we just joined
the fucking marines.
hey, man, i hope you know
what we just done, is just a joke.

come on, mister, give them a break!
them's the rules.
my mother will die without me.

too bad. i got a pair
of queens. i beat you.
ah! not so fast, i said pairs of deuces.

you've got numbers in a row, right?
- yeah.

no, but i got something very close.
four, six, seven, eight and ten.
if only i got a five and a nine.
that's tough luck, baby.
oh, that's too bad. too bad.

it wasn't that bad. not as you think.
i'm gonna miss turkey, man.
here comes the bastard.
hi, richie, man.
richie, i got your homework.
hey, guys, what are you doing?
...the president's
limousine was put away.
mr. haggerty explained, too...
the dome was not off
as you can see here.
there's the president
and mrs. kennedy,
just minutes before he was shot.
this is not confirmed.
we have it on what would
normally be good authority...
that the president has died.
however, we repeat,
this is not confirmed.
at the hospital, admiral
george burkley, u.s.-navy...
went for the emergency...
now, as you can see here,
mrs. kennedy steps into the car.
that's her waving.
that's the president waving.
richie,
- you know what true love means?
- yeah.
that it means standing up by the
person you love, thick and thin?
do you?
- hello, father.
- hello, father.
do you know what else
true love means?
true love for a woman means having
the baby of the man she loves.
and do you know what
true love in a man is?
true love in a man...
is wanting that woman who
loves him to have his baby.
- don't you feel that's what true love is?
- oh, yeah. definitely.
richie,
i really feel true love for you.
i'd like to know if you
feel true love for me.
sure i do.
sure you do what?
no, i really do.
you really do what?
i really feel true
love for you, despie.
because the parents
should be in love.
i mean, when i told my daddy
i thought i was pregnant,
- ...he told me he thought the parents...
- what?!
richie, my daddy wants to see you..
look, i ain't no hard guy.
i was your age once. i used to put
them away like there was no tomorrow,
but one thing i never did
it with nobody's daughter.
not only did you do it with my daughter,
but you knocked her up, you dumb wop!
you ain't got nothing up here.
it's all down here.
all right. i ain't no hard guy. it takes
two to tango and all that bullshit.
she's been banging since junior high
and you're the first jerk to get caught.
- daddy, how could you?
- you should've given her an ankle bracelet.
stop the jerking off.
the thing is, you knocked her up.
and now you gotta pay the
price and do the right thing.
it's the sportsman's way.
hey, what's this?
now you're scared.
get up!
to my new son-in-law.
you'll live in the basement.
we got wood paneling.
gloria! come on down!
come on over here, popsie!
hey, do you like clams?
i'll take us all to city island for
some clams. i ain't no hard guy.
what does it say?
- eighteen inches.
- eighteen inches.
you know what it was in '40, '41?
seventeen and a half.
the greek was eighteen.
did i tell you i seen
him the other day?
he's turned into a tub of lard.
feel it. eighteen inches,
right where it counts.
who do you think the
judges would vote for now?
- i'll be right down! yeah!
- keep it down in there!
why don't you go see
joey play, emilio?
i don't wanna get embarrassed.
i understand he's good. you won't
get embarrassed. go on, emilio.
not today. i'm busy.
we're so great! we're first rate!
shit. looks like them
niggers ain't gonna show.
the chickenshits.
always have been.
hey, what's that?
holy shit! it looks like
they ripped off a circus.
we gotta win, we gotta win,
we gotta really win!
where's that boyfriend?
okay!
you know why they call you
guys the wanderers, man?
because after this game,
you'll wonder what happened.
come on, motherfucker!
hey!
play ball!
come on, break it up. break it up!
all right!
sixteen!
thirty-nine!
twenty-four!
time! time!
- fucking protection!
- stay in your pocket!
you got your hands in my pockets.
you guys block like a bunch of fruits.
hey, screw you, man!
don't talk like that.
i'll talk the way i want, understand?
i'm the quarterback, asshole!
- then be the quarterback!
- shut up, all of you guys!
maybe some of you guys got
a right to hate my guts.
but i think if we had joey at halfback and
me at quarterback, we'd have a chance.
that's the way it was meant to be.
i've been thinking a lot about it
and i just wanna say to joey here,
i'm sorry. i want to apologize.
what do you say?
that's great, man, great.
all i wanna say is that whatever
i've done is in the past, all right?
all is forgotten. okay?
what we gotta do now, is to win
this game for the wanderers.
what do you say?
wanderers forever, right, joey?
let's kill them!
- ready?
- set!
strong right, full house.
wanderers' special on one, ready?
let's go, come on!
going left, full house,
despie special.
tie game, mothers!
throw the goddamn ball!

okay, let's have the ball.
i ain't going over there.
if you want the ball,
brother, you go get it, okay?
hey, clinton,
you guys chickening out?
hell, no. there's some short, runny-ass
sucker over there with a big blade.
- what?
- yeah.
- i don't see nothing?
- oh, you don't nothing?
come on, let's go.

all right!
we look good and we look pride, but
you look like a cow's behind, all right!

- i don't know.
she went out for a while.
it's okay, man, sleep over.

- hey, come on.
- no, really.
it ain't exactly high blood pressure.

she checked in to some
kind of hospital.

i'm sorry, man.
oh, man, no,
there's nothing to be sorry for.

i'm scared.
hey, what's wrong with that?
what do you mean?
hey, joey, do me a favor.
if we gonna travel together,
you gotta promise not to be an asshole.

bachelor party for richie, all right?
