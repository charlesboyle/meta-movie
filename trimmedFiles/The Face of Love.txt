<i>that's what i want to do.</i>
<i>for the weekend, the national weather
service is issuing a high...</i>
- morning.
- morning.
mom, why is roger always
swimming in your pool?
because he's a
neighbor and a friend,
and why shouldn't he?
maybe he should pay the pool boy.
he's the only one that uses it.
well, somebody should enjoy it.
i heard you on the phone all night.
was that josh?
mm-hmm.
oh.
i'm going home today.
what?
back to seattle?
what about our weekend?
oh, honey.
you're obsessed.
i don't want you to
lose yourself in this.
honey, you put so much
into these relationships.
i just don't want to see
you get hurt is all.
well, do you think
that's avoidable?
no, no, it isn't.
hey.
do you ever go there
anymore... the museum?
oh.
no, not since your father.
you used to practically live there.
mm.
well, i don't like to look back.
<i>to the south,</i>
<i>and there's a new exhibition
opening this week</i>
<i>at the los angeles
county museum of art,</i>
<i>going back in time over
the last two millennia</i>
<i>and exploring the roots of
sculptural representation...</i>
(reflective piano music)
(telephone ringing)
(gasps)
mm.
(ringing continues)
hello.
uh, no, he's not.
i'm... let me interrupt you.
excuse me.
he... he's dead.
he died five years ago.
that... that's all right.
yes, you can take
him off your list.
thanks.
(inhales sharply)
(waves crashing)
oh, god, there's nothing like
the smell of fresh bread,
is there?
i'm so glad i hired you.
nikki, you have really put
some life into this place.
thanks. it's what i do.
it's been on the market 18 months.
i had to drop the
price three times.
well, you know what?
i'm not surprised.
it was like a mausoleum
when i got in here.
i kept expecting to see
norma desmond grieving
over her dead chimp.
(both chuckle)
looks good.
flowers.
nice.
uh, that goes up in
the master, please.
yes, ma'am.
oh, good.
(indistinct conversation)
it's four bedrooms.
there's a really huge...
(humming)
(laughs)
elementary schools.
talk to them. and, um...
and you've seen the list of...
(truck beeping)
hmm.
(indistinct conversation)
in pursuit of the past?
what?
special exhibition or
regular collection?
uh, just regular
collection, please.
are you a member?
uh, no, not anymore.
(gasps) oh.
- (hums)
- (chuckles)
i love going here with you.
(uneasy orchestral music)
(engine turns over)
here we are.
went to the cemetery today.
- oh.
- have you been lately?
i mean, wait till you see it. you know
that... that lawn... that big open field
that used to be there? you
know they've swallowed it up.
it's just all headstones and benches
and mausoleums... the whole shebang.
i mean, they have more dead than
they know what to do with them.
no, i don't go too often anymore.
i get it.
you grieved enough.
- well...
- i was always in awe of you.
you did it the right way.
i don't think so.
mm. i made an ass of myself.
- you did not.
- i always did the wrong things.
there's no wrong way.
- you want to hear something funny?
- yes, please.
i thought i saw him today.
- who?
- garrett.
what do you mean? that's...
at the museum. looked
like him, anyway.
he walked right by me...
was a double.
it was... god, it was
almost a perfect double.
oh, christ, that must
have been, like...
- oh, it was.
- wow.
(sighs)
what do you think he
was, like, a projection,
or maybe you're just... you know,
wishful thinking, you know?
- no, i didn't make him up.
- no, no, i didn't mean that.
i mean, it's just that, you know,
you... you saw someone
- who looked similar, and you... you...
- no. no.
it was... it was incredible.
well, you know what they say. we all
have a double somewhere in the world.
that's right.
wow.
i have to look through
shoe boxes of old photos
just to remember what
susan looked like.
oh, you do not.
well, she's a bit chalky.
oh, that's so sad.
(chuckles)
so maybe this guy's your type.
or do you have a type?
no.
i mean yes: garrett.
hmm.
what are you gonna do?
- do?
- yeah.
what do you mean?
i'm not gonna do anything.
really?
are you gonna try
and see him again?
you know...
to say what? "excuse me, sir.
"you happen to be a double
for my dead husband.
can i buy you a drink?"
(both laughing)
yeah, yeah. that's right.
it's a little creepy, yeah.
no.
i have to say it was nice.
it was just nice for a moment,
seeing him today,
believing garrett was still around.
it just felt like it used to.
felt like being alive again.
(glasses clink)
(indistinct conversation)
(sighs)
(rhythmic clinking)
(clinking continues)
(morose orchestral music)
good morning, nikki.
morning, antonio.
oop.
(sprinklers hissing)
(squeaking)
(man speaking indistinctly on radio)
(vehicle door slams)
(engine turns over)
hello!
uh, excuse me!
excuse me!
(tires squeal)
(sighs)
(sighs)
oh, wah-ha...
(horn honks)
(pants)
(solemn orchestral music)
um, excuse me.
do you know where room 200 is?
uh, excuse me.
may i help you?
hi.
hello.
hi.
wh-what can i do for you?
i, uh, was interested in the class.
oh, i'm sorry, but we're in
the middle of a semester.
oh.
did you check with the office?
did you check with admissions?
you know, i... i didn't.
well, i did.
um, i just, um... just
to find the classroom.
i-i... it was just
a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.
well, this is a college.
they're not very spontaneous.
right.
yeah.
(sniffles)
are you all right?
i'm so sorry. i just didn't...
i didn't think this through.
well, no worries. i mean, the next
semester starts in january or...
- a couple months.
- no, i-i... no...
what?
you sure... are you okay?
no, it's just a...
an empty-nest kind of a thing.
i-i just wanted to keep busy.
well, kids, huh?
they're just one long grieving process.
you know, where's my baby?
where's my kindergartner?
where's my little boy?
exactly. well, you know...
it's okay. it's okay.
- i... this is...
- it's okay.
- it's okay.
- i shouldn't have come.
no, it's all right.
no, no. i... this...
this isn't real.
- what?
- it's just not real.
you're not...
wait.
hmm.
mm.
(laughter)
yeah, right.
i understand.
well, i'll see you monday.
you're back.
yeah.
are you gonna run away on me again?
i might.
(chuckles)
understandable.
i mean, look at me.
i'm one scary dude.
listen, i'm sorry.
i think i was a little
strange the other day.
yeah, you were a little emotional.
i was.
well, it's a strange time.
kids leaving home...
it's got to be strange.
mm.
yeah.
are you married?
um... no.
gone.
gone?
yeah. he left me.
just up and left?
(chuckles)
brutal.
- yeah.
- sorry.
you go on, i guess.
i guess.
my wife left me.
oh.
ten years ago.
found somebody else,
tells me he's the love of her life.
ouch.
right?
i mean, it's been a decade,
and i still feel it.
well...
listen, i... um, do you do
anything outside of school...
you know, like, uh,
private students?
what are we talking, lessons?
yes.
exactly. lessons.
well, uh, i-i don't usually.
oh.
um, well, listen,
i-i have taken classes before.
this is... i'm not a
complete amateur.
my studio's not really
set up for that.
oh.
well, wait. you could
come to my house.
right?
okay?
uh, i could, uh,
give you my number,
uh, and i'll write it
down for you here, right?
and then you could, you
know, think about it.
um... i'll write my name down,
and you could, you know,
think about how much
you would charge,
the whole bit, all right?
so anyway, thanks.
thanks.
(chuckles)
(latin music playing over radio)
(sighs)
hi.
hi.
wow. i can't believe you're here.
why wouldn't i be?
(chuckles)
come on in.
thanks.
wow.
beautiful house.
thank you.
who's the architect?
uh, my husband, actually.
and the ruscha?
so are you the art collector?
uh, no, that was him too.
well, good for you.
he splits, you get the
house and all the artwork.
(chuckles)
there's some more in here if
you'd like to have a look.
okay.
come on in.
so you'd consider yourself
a california artist?
no.
no, i'm more of an
all-over kind of guy.
army brat, third generation.
oh.
i signed up before
they could draft me.
well, you made it back okay.
yeah, i did.
took my time.
kind of... kind of walked back.
you walked back?
well, i caught a cargo
plane to kuala lumpur,
got on a boat to pondicherry,
went up india to nepal,
down to karachi,
across the middle east,
north africa, spent a
little time in morocco.
i actually lived in
france for quite a while
and wound up in new
york ten years later.
wow.
so you came back an artist.
yeah, well, i think it was more
i was looking for the one thing
that would piss my
father off the most.
mm. i always envied that
bohemian lifestyle.
i wanted to tramp around
the world and, you know,
drink cheap wine, live in a loft.
wake up and paint?
yes, smoke gauloises.
so what stopped you?
ah. i... fell in love.
tragic.
yeah.
(chuckles)
yes.
so what did you end up
doing with yourself?
oh, this and that.
you know, 9 lives, 14 professions,
and i stage houses now.
you stage houses?
yeah.
when people want to sell their house
but they moved out and it's empty,
i-i dress it.
i-i make it seem lived-in so people
can imagine themselves living there.
oh.
breathe life into the emptiness.
do you have everything?
uh, yeah.
okay.
good.
we'll call that a trial lesson.
what do you mean?
well, i mean, you know, you
can stop now if you want.
no charge.
keep the steak knives.
no, that's really the
nicest afternoon
i've had in a while.
good.
great.
so we'll keep going.
oh, please.
i'll see you, um, thursday.
great.
i look forward to it.
- all right. bye.
- (chuckles)
hi, summer. it's mom.
um, i just was checking
in just to see,
um, how you're doing.
how's josh?
anyway, um, we just
hadn't talked in a while,
and i wanted to tell
you i missed you,
and i love you,
and, um, guess what.
i-i started an art class.
i know i have no skill whatsoever,
but, anyway, i just am
so excited about it.
i wanted to tell you.
so give me a call back
when you get a chance.
bye.
(sighs)
hi, roger. it's me. hi.
what are you doing?
found this lovely gourmet shop around the
corner. i went a little crazy, but, uh...
roger, i invited you.
oh, please. a lot of this stuff
i had just lying around.
i was just waiting for
the right occasion.
besides, any excuse to
break out the kitsch-ware.
very cute.
yeah. it was susan's.
her mother bought her
the complete set...
shellfish butter knives.
stuff made her laugh.
yeah, stuff still makes me smile.
(chuckles)
wow.
i can't have anything
of garrett's around.
really?
no.
i hid most of it or,
you know, chucked it,
boxed it up right when i got back.
i just purged the whole house.
just too painful.
i like thinking about her.
yeah?
roger?
mm?
i think i might have
found somebody.
what do you mean?
i met a man.
that's terrific, nikki.
i'm ecstatic for you.
what? you sound mad.
yeah, yeah, i guess i am.
i am mad.
why?
(sighs)
i've been asking you out for years.
i realize i'm just your neighbor.
roger, you were garrett's friend.
so what? he's dead.
susan's dead.
roger, i-i'm sorry.
(sighs)
so is he, uh, younger?
some boy toy?
- he's my type.
- hmm.
congrats.
so you've fallen in love
with somebody else.
no, i-i think i'm still
very much in love with garrett.
i...
i'm more in love
with him than ever.
you know what i remember
most about him...
i mean, about finding
him when he drowned?
there was sand on his lips...
these little grains,
these little crystals.
isn't that weird
that that's what i would remember?
(somber music)
(sighs)
(sniffles)
(sniffles)
(chuckles)
annie, annie, quite contrary.
how your garden grows.
with silver bells and cockle shells
and one pathetic petunia.
what brings you this
far east, picasso?
i was wondering if you still had
any of my old painting stuff here.
ten years later?
what's the inspiration?
new student?
i'll have you know i graduated
from students years ago.
i moved on to adjunct faculty.
(chuckles)
i saw the sign out front.
are you selling the house?
the price of cancer went up.
- seriously?
- i know.
- i should have told you, but...
- no, no. it's your house now.
it's just...
where are you guys gonna go?
i don't know.
the flats, i guess.
someplace cheaper.
are you okay?
yeah.
clean as a whistle.
good.
- you?
- yes.
so far, so good.
(knocks wood)
(dramatic music)
(hinges creak)
(whispers) wow.
they're beautiful.
we could paint them,
but i thought they'd be
nice just to look at.
our last house had them all over...
that and banana trees.
god, that was a while back.
where was this?
- los feliz.
- oh, yeah?
- i used to live up there.
- yeah?
we had to move because
of the big earthquake.
- remember that?
- '94. i sure do.
it was pretty scary.
yeah. all the power went out.
yeah.
it was early, right?
still dark out.
iran up to the roof,
and i looked up,
and i could see the
entire milky way.
i had run into summer's room
right when it happened.
i was so scared.
oh, her room was just destroyed.
all of the books were on her bed,
and then i remembered
she was at a sleepover.
who's summer?
my daughter.
oh.
nice pool.
thanks. are you a swimmer?
yeah. i like to swim.
as a matter of fact, i was
going to the y after this.
oh.
i used to love to swim.
but not anymore?
no, i... i don't go in the water.
i don't know. i'm not
doing something right.
(chuckles)
i'm terrible. (laughs)
no, you're not.
- i-i can't even think how to start.
- don't think. just look.
i mean, you know, painting is...
it's seeing, so you just take it in
and then... pssh!... put it down.
express yourself.
you don't really care
about painting, do you?
(laughs)
well, not really. no.
so, i mean, wh-what
are we doing here?
well, my husband liked art.
but not you?
no, i like to look at it.
well, maybe we could go to
some galleries together.
oh.
i would like that.
yeah.
you miss him, don't you?
no.
not now.
you know, you actually
could just swim here.
you could use the pool.
really?
i'll make some lunch.
okay.
hoo, boy.
(dramatic music)
hey!
what?
what are you doing?
i was just holding my breath.
god, you scared me.
i'm fine.
okay.
(laughter)
(sighs)
(rushed orchestral music)
(phone beeping)
(telephone rings)
hi.
hi.
um, uh...
i, uh... i'd like to
ask you a question.
will you have dinner with me?
are you asking me on a date?
yeah. dinner.
i'd li... i want to
take you out on a date.
um, well, can i, uh...
can i pick the place?
yeah, sure.
(phone beeping)
do you have to get that?
no, no. it's okay.
so, yeah?
you'll... you'll go with me?
okay. yes.
let's go.
okay, great.
- (laughs)
- i'll talk to you later.
(sighs)
hey.
oh! it's so good to see you again.
it's been such a long time!
- yes, it has.
- please.
thank you.
i was worried about you.
where did you go?
oh,
just all over.
(both chuckle)
well, it's good to see you both.
- thank you.
- i'm glad you're back.
(chuckles)
who does he think i am?
i don't know.
you've been here before.
well, yeah.
not in years, though.
it's just so nice to see
things haven't changed.
- hmm?
- how is your daughter?
all grown up now, yes?
yes.
all grown up.
(chuckles)
so do you know what you like?
i like you.
(softly serious orchestral music)
wow.
could you excuse me for a minute?
what's wrong?
is something wrong?
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
nikki, you in there?
uh, yeah.
did i do something wrong?
i've never had anyone react
that way to a kiss before.
no, no, i...
it's just been a while.
i'm sure a let's going
through your mind.
we could start over.
whatever you want to do.
um...
it's not you.
there's... there's just
something i have to tell you.
(chuckles)
you know what? i'm sorry.
i just think you
better take me home.
all right.
(blinkers clicking)
look, nikki, you've had a life.
i've had a life.
it's selfish, but you look at me
in a way that nobody
ever has before,
and when i'm with you,
i feel something different,
and here you are.
i don't really know you.
you don't really know me.
i guess your heart's broken...
but i don't want to let you go.
so where does that leave us?
(dramatic music)
(water running)
(cell phone ringing)
(cell phone beeps)
hi, summer.
(sighs)
you got what you wanted.
it's over.
what's over? what are
you talking about?
me and josh... it ended.
oh, honey, i'm so sorry.
but you know what? i should give
you credit, 'cause you were right.
you didn't think that
it was real, and...
i guess that it wasn't.
oh, no, i... honey... i was
just trying to protect you.
you know, whatever.
anyway, i was thinking i could come home
for a while and, like, keep you company.
oh, sweetie, um,
i'm not so sure that's a good idea.
i thought you would be
happy to have me home.
happy? no, of course i'd be happy.
i just... it's... maybe
you should just stay,
you know, work it
through, face it all.
i don't know. i...
i can't seem to get away
from him, you know?
i mean, every place
that i look reminds me.
and i see him constantly,
everywhere, you know?
no, i understand. i do. i...
listen, honey, i have to go,
okay? can i call you back?
well, uh... yeah, uh, you can.
are you okay?
no, i'm fine. i'm wonderful. i...
could i... i just need to call you back.
(chuckles)
okay.
bye.
bye.
(cell phone beeping)
you're something else.
i could take a bath in
how you look at me.
(telephone rings)
hey.
hi.
it's early. something must be up.
yeah.
what's her name?
(chuckles)
how did you know?
oh, you really have to ask me that?
anne, um,
i think i'm out of my depth here.
you?
yeah, what does it mean when
i can hardly catch my breath
whenever i'm with her?
and then i get this
pain in my chest.
is your arm numb?
no, it's not that kind of pain.
it isn't that kind of hurt.
it's a... it's a good hurt.
(chuckles)
i've never... i've never
felt like this before.
never?
i thought you were mad about me.
yeah.
but not like this?
you won't hurt my feelings.
we're friends, remember?
it's... it's just different
somehow, you know?
i'm so happy for you.
are you?
oh, are you kidding?
i've been waiting for
this day for ten years.
thank you.
and... and she knows
about the bum ticker?
why do you have to go
and spoil it like that?
you know you're living
a total fantasy.
i'm not dying any
more than you are.
i'm sorry. that...
i'm sorry.
don't be.
you're right.
just thought i'd ask.
(telephone beeps)
(latin music playing)
(food sizzling)
- hi.
- hi.
how are you?
my god, it's just...
it's like a museum.
how long have you been here?
oh, i've had this place
forever, but i just...
i just moved back here,
oh, ten years ago.
remember when a 30-year
mortgage felt like a lifetime?
well, she's all mine,
free and clear.
uh, when my wife and i split up,
i looked through the house, and...
(speaking indistinctly)
here we go.
whoa.
(sighs)
nikki?
- yeah?
- you all right?
i'm fine.
i'm fi... i just got
a little dizzy.
- you're white.
- no, no.
no, it's no big deal.
no, i-i just...
i just need a minute.
(chuckles)
- sure.
- uh, it's... it's just...
just all this life, it's...
all the years gone by.
you sure you're okay?
yeah, i-i'm sure.
don't... don't worry.
(glasses clink)
i'm fine.
so what's in here?
it's my studio.
(whispers) wow.
i just started painting again.
when did you stop?
ten years ago.
when your wife left you?
i lost all desire.
i just didn't have it anymore.
oh.
and the funny thing was i...
i didn't even want to look at art
for the longest time.
so you stopped going to museums?
yeah.
you know, and then a
couple months ago, i...
who knows why...
i woke up in the morning,
and it was... it was
back, you know?
i needed it again.
hmm.
and that's why i
drove over to lacma,
and i spent the whole
afternoon, and...
so what's that?
is that new?
that's not for today.
what does that mean?
it means it's not done yet.
oh. that's okay.
- no.
- i'd like to...
no, no, no.
i-i don't want you looking at it
till it's finished. it's a surprise.
well, is it me?
is it a nude?
(laughs)
you're gonna just
have to wait and see.
am i your muse?
wait and see.
are you looking for something?
um, i guess where
all the years went.
yeah.
i hate getting older.
i know i'm not
supposed to say that.
what are you supposed to say?
(chuckles)
that i've grown into myself,
that i...
enjoy being older, wiser.
but the truth is i don't.
i mean, it's getting
harder and harder
to look in the mirror.
i know.
who is that old fart
staring back at me?
(chuckles)
yeah. right?
(chuckles)
you know, sometimes i
go to bed at night,
and i think, "well...

one, another day."

backwards into the sunset.
oh, waxing sentimental.

about all the good times and bad times.

how happy we were.
