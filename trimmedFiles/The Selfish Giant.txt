in the race for you?
well, are you?

then, eh?
if he wins in race,
he increases in value.

for thousands, isn't it?
- shut the fuck up.

you shouldn't be drinking that
shite anyway.
you're hyper enough as it is.
you need tranquilizers.

- yeah, thought it was gonna be
a bit hard,
but he's easily pulled back,
isn't he?

i've had enough now.
maybe a spell in jail
will do him good,
sort him out.
he can detox and all.
- can still get it inside, mum.
- how do you know that?
- everyone knows that.
- he ain't here.
i've kicked him out.

- it's all sorted now, thanks.
- you should take
your shoes off.
shoes off.
- this is a formal interview
under caution.
do you understand that, fenton?
hey, do you understand?
- yeah.
- a witness saw two youths
burning railway
or communications cable.
- that's nowt to do with him.
- cable theft is a very serious
crime, mrs. fenton.
trespass on the railway
is £1,000 fine.
- i ain't been on railway.
- vandalism.
endangering lives.
maximum penalty
of life imprisonment.
- he's just a kid.
he ain't nicked no cable.
you're looking at wrong place.
- he is, as you say,
mrs. fenton, a minor.
there's unscrupulous people
out there getting kids
to do their dirty work
so they don't get into trouble
with the police themselves.
- i do look out for him.
- is that it?
go on, then.
you can put your shoes back on.
- see ya.
- bye.
- you heard what
that policewoman said.
that kitten is using you.
i don't want you
going down there no more.
- mum, i'm gonna make
a lot of money.
- i said i don't want you
going down there no more.
- for god's sake.
- don't do that.
can't you see it's pulling
on the corner of his mouth?
how would you like it
if someone did it to you?
- fuck off.
you think you know it all, you.
- hey, what are you doing here?
i told you,
i don't trust him near diesel.

big bucks.
