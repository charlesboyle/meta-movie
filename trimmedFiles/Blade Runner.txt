<i>replication center level 9,
we have a b 1 security alert.</i>
<i>stand by for...</i>
care if i talk?
i'm kind of nervous when i take tests.
just please don't move.
oh, sorry.
i already had an iq test this year.
i don't think i've had one of these.
reaction time is a factor, so pay attention.
now answer as quickly as you can.
sure.
that's the hotel.
- what?
- where i live.
- nice place?
- yeah, sure, i guess.
is that part of the test?
no. just warming you up. that's all.
it's not fancy or anything.
you're in a desert, walking
along in the sand, when...
is this the test, now?
yes. you're in a desert,
walking along in the sand...
...when you look down...
- what one?
- what?
- what desert?
doesn't make any difference.
it's completely hypothetical.
- but how come i'd be there?
- maybe you're fed up.
maybe you wanna be by yourself. who knows?
you look down and see a tortoise.
- it's crawling towards you...
- tortoise? what's that?
- you know what a turtle is?
- of course.
same thing.
i've never seen a turtle.
but i understand what you mean.
you reach down, you flip the
tortoise over on its back.
do you make up these questions, mr. holden?
or do they write them down for you?
the tortoise lays on its back,
its belly baking in the sun...
<i>...beating its legs, trying to
turn itself over, but it can't...</i>
...not without your help.
- you're not helping.
- what do you mean i'm not?
i mean, you're not helping.
why is that, leon?
they're just questions, leon.
in answer to your query,
they're written down for me.
it's a test designed to
provoke an emotional response.
shall we continue?
describe in single words only the
good things that come into your mind...
...about your mother.
- my mother?
- yeah.
let me tell you about my mother.
<i>a new life awaits you in
the off-world colonies.</i>
<i>the chance to begin again...</i>
<i>... in a golden land of

<i>... designed especially for your needs.</i>
<i>so come on, america. let's put out...</i>
give me four.
no, four. two, two. four.
and noodles.
hey.
he say you under arrest, mr. deckard.
got the wrong guy, pal.
he say you blade runner.
tell him i'm eating.
captain bryant...
bryant, huh?

<i>over the landing threshold.</i>
hiya, deck.
bryant.
you wouldn't have come if i
just asked you to. sit down, pal.
come on, don't be an asshole, deckard.
i've got four skin-jobs walking the streets.
they jumped a shuttle off-world,
killed the crew and passengers.
they found the shuttle drifting
off the coast two weeks ago...
<i>...so we know they're around.</i>
embarrassing.
no, sir, not embarrassing. no one's
ever gonna find out they're down here.
because you're gonna spot
them and air them out.
i don't work here anymore.
give it to holden.
- he's good.
- i did.
he can breathe okay as
long as nobody unplugs him.
he's not good enough. not good as you.
i need you, deck.
now, this is a bad one, the worst yet.
i need the old blade runner.
i need your magic.
i was quit when i come in here, bryant.
i'm twice as quit now.
stop right where you are.
you know the score, pal?
if you're not cop, you're little people.
no choice, huh?
no choice, pal.
<i>i already had an iq test this year.</i>
<i>i don 't think i've ever had one of these.</i>

<i>- nice place?
- yeah, sure, i guess.</i>
there was an escape from the
off-world colonies two weeks ago.
six replicants: three male, three female.
they slaughtered 23 people
and jumped a shuttle.
an aerial patrol spotted
the ship off the coast.
no crew, no sight of them.
three nights ago they tried to
break into tyrell corporation.
two of them got fried running
through an electrical field.
we lost the others.
on the possibility they might
try to infiltrate as employees...
...i had holden go over and run voight
- kampff tests on the new workers.
looks like he got himself one.
<i>so you look down and you see a
tortoise. it's crawling towards you.</i>
<i>- tortoise?
- that's leon.</i>
ammunition loader on intergalactic runs.
he can lift 400-pound atomic
loads all day and night.
the only way you can hurt him is to kill him.
<i>i don't get it. what do they risk coming
back to earth for? that's unusual. why...?</i>
what do they want out of
the tyrell corporation?
well, you tell me, pal.
that's what you're here for.
- what's this?
- nexus 6. roy batty.
incept date: 2016.
combat model. optimum self-sufficiency.
probably the leader.
this is zhora.
she's trained for an
off-world kick murder squad.
talk about beauty and the beast. she's both.
the fourth skin-job is
pris, a basic pleasure model.
the standard item for military
clubs in the outer colonies.
they were designed to copy human beings
in every way except their emotions.
the designers reckoned after a few years...
...they might develop their
own emotional responses.
oh, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
so they built in a fail-safe device.
- which is what? -
four-year lifespan.
now, there's a nexus 6 over
at the tyrell corporation.
- i want you to go put the machine on it.
- and if the machine doesn't work?
do you like our owl?
it's artificial?
of course it is.
must be expensive.
very. i'm rachael.
deckard.
it seems you feel our work is
not a benefit to the public.
replicants are like any other machine:
they're either a benefit or a hazard.
if they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
may i ask you a personal question?
sure.
have you ever retired a human by mistake?
no.
- but in your position, that is a risk.
- is this to be an empathy test?
capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response?
fluctuation of the pupil.
involuntary dilation of the iris.
we call it voight-kampff for short.
mr. deckard, dr. eldon tyrell.
demonstrate it.
i wanna see it work.
- where's the subject?
- i wanna see it work on a person.
i wanna see a negative before
i provide you with a positive.
what's that gonna prove?
indulge me.
on you?
try her.
it's too bright in here.
do you mind if i smoke?
it won't affect the test.
all right, i'm gonna ask
you a series of questions.
just relax and answer
them as simply as you can.
it's your birthday. someone
gives you a calfskin wallet.
i wouldn't accept it.
also, i'd report the person
who gave it to me to the police.
you've got a little boy. he shows
you his butterfly collection...
...plus the killing jar.
i'd take him to the doctor.
you're watching television.
suddenly you realize there's
a wasp crawling on your arm.
i'd kill it.
you're reading a magazine. you come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.
is this testing whether i'm a
replicant or a lesbian, mr. deckard?
just answer the questions, please.
you show it to your husband.
he likes it so much he hangs
it on your bedroom wall.
- bush outside your window?
i wouldn't let him.
- orange body, green legs?
why not?
i should be enough for him.
one more question.
you're watching a stage play,
a banquet is in progress.
the guests are enjoying an
appetizer of raw oysters.
the entrée consists of boiled dog.
would you step out for
a few moments, rachael?
thank you.
she's a replicant, isn't she?
i'm impressed.
how many questions does it
usually take to spot one?
- i don't get it, tyrell.
- how many questions?
twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
it took more than a hundred
for rachael, didn't it?
she doesn't know.
she's beginning to suspect, i think.
suspect? how can it not know what it is?
commerce is our goal here at tyrell.
"more human than human" is our motto.
rachael is an experiment, nothing more.
we began to recognize in
them a strange obsession.
after all, they are emotionally
inexperienced, with only a few years...
...in which to store up the experiences
which you and i take for granted.
if we gift them with a past, we create a
cushion or a pillow for their emotions...
...then consequently we
can control them better.
memories.
you're talking about memories.
<i>reaction time is a factor,

i don't know such stuff.
i just do eyes.

i design your eyes.

...if only you could see
what i've seen with your eyes.

...questions.
i don't know answers.

- 97. thank you. danke.</i>
i wanted to see you.
so i waited.
let me help you.
what do i need help for?
i don't know why he told you what he did.
talk to him.
he wouldn't see me.
you want a drink?
no?
you think i'm a replicant, don't you?
look.
it's me with my mother.
yeah?
remember when you were 6?
you and your brother snuck into an
empty building through a basement window.
you were gonna play doctor?
he showed you his, and when it got to
be your turn, you chickened and ran.
remember that?
did you ever tell anybody that?
your mother, tyrell, anybody, huh?
you remember the spider that lived
in the bush outside your window?
orange body, green legs?
watched her build a web all summer?
then one day, there's a big egg in it.
the egg hatched...
- the egg hatched...
- and?
...and a hundred baby spiders came out.
and they ate her.
implants.
those aren't your memories,
they're somebody else's.
they're tyrell's niece's.
okay.
bad joke.
i made a bad joke.
you're not a replicant.
go home.
okay?
no, really. i'm sorry.
go home.
want a drink?
i'll get you a drink.
i'll get a glass.
hey!
you forgot your bag.
i'm lost.
don't worry, i won't hurt you.
what's your name?
- pris.
- mine's j.f. sebastian.
- hi.
- hi.
oh, where were you going?
home?
i don't have one.
we scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
we sure did.
i'm hungry, j.f.
i got stuff inside.
you wanna come in?
i was hoping you'd say that.
do you live in this building all by yourself?
yeah, i live here pretty
much alone right now.
no housing shortage around here.
plenty of room for everybody.
watch out for the water.
must get ionely here, j.f.
not really. i make friends.
they're toys. my friends
are toys. i make them.
it's a hobby. i'm a genetic designer.
do you know what that is?
no.
now.
yoo-hoo, home again.
home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.
- good evening, j.f.
- evening, fellas.
they're my friends. i made them.
where are your folks?
i'm sort of an orphan.
what about your friends?
i have some, but i have to find them.
i'll let them know where i am tomorrow.

taffey lewis?
thank you.
- taffey?
- yeah?
i'd like to ask you a few questions.
blow.
you ever buy snakes from
the egyptian, taffey?
all the time, pal.
you ever see this girl, huh?
never seen her. buzz off.
your licenses in order, pal?
hey, louie.
the man is dry. give him
one on the house, okay? see?
hello?
i've had people walk out on
me before, but not when...
...i was being so charming.
i'm in a bar, here now,
down in the fourth sector.
taffey lewis is on the line.
why don't you come on
down here and have a drink?
<i>i don 't think so, mr. deckard.</i>
<i>that's not my kind of place.</i>
go someplace else?
<i>ladies and gentlemen...</i>
<i>... taffey lewis presents
miss salome and the snake.</i>
<i>watch her take the
pleasure from the serpent...</i>
<i>... that once corrupted man.</i>
excuse me, miss salome, can
i talk to you for a minute?
i'm from the american
federation of variety artists.
oh, yeah?
i'm not here to make you join. no,
ma'am. that's not my department.
actually...
<i>...i'm from the confidential
committee on moral abuses.</i>
committee of moral abuses?
there's been reports that the management...
...has been taking
liberties with the artists.
i don't know nothing about it.
have you felt yourself to
be exploited in any way?
how do you mean "exploited"?
well, like to get this job.
<i>i mean, did you do, or were you
asked to do, anything that's...</i>
...lewd or unsavory or...
...otherwise repulsive to your person, huh?
- are you for real?
- oh, yeah.
i'd like to check your
dressing room, if i may.
- for what?
- for holes.
holes?
well, you'd be surprised
what a guy would go through...
...to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
no, i wouldn't.
little...
...dirty holes they drill in the
wall so they can watch a lady undress.
- is this a real snake?
- of course it's not real.
think i'd be working in a place like
this if i could afford a real snake?
so if somebody does try to exploit
me, who do i go to about it?
- me.
- you're a dedicated man. dry me.
the only thing they care about...

christ, deckard, you look almost as bad
as that skin-job you left on the sidewalk.
i'm going home.
could learn from this guy, gaff.
he's a goddamn one-man
slaughterhouse, that's what he is.
four more to go.
- come on, gaff, let's go.
- three.
there's three to go.
there's four.
that skin-job you vk'd at
the tyrell corporation...
...rachael, disappeared, vanished.
didn't even know she was a replicant.
something to do with a
brain implant, says tyrell.
come on, gaff. drink some for me, huh, pal?
leon.
how old am i?
i don't know.
my birthday's april 10,
four years.
more than you.
painful to live in fear, isn't it?
nothing is worse than having
an itch you can never scratch.
i agree.
wake up. time to die.
shakes?
me too.
i get them bad.
it's part of the business.
i'm not in the business.
i am the business.
what if i go north?
disappear.
would you come after me?
hunt me?
no.
no, i wouldn't.
i owe you one.
but somebody would.
deckard...
...you know those files on me?
the incept date. the longevity.
those things.
you saw them?
<i>they're...</i>
...classified.
but you're a policeman.
i...
...didn't look at them.
you know, that voight-kampff
test of yours...
...did you ever take that test yourself?
deckard.
i dreamt music.
i didn't know if i could play.
i remember lessons.
i don't know if it's me or tyrell's niece.
you play beautifully.
now you kiss me.
i can't rely on my...
say, "kiss me."
kiss me.
i want you.
i want you.
again.
i want you.
put your hands on me.
- what you doing?
- i'm sorry. just peeking.
- how do i look?
- you look better.
- just better?
- well...
...you look beautiful.
thanks.
how old are you?
twenty-five.
- what's your problem?
- methuselah syndrome.
what's that?
my glands, they grow old too fast.
- is that why you're still on earth?
- yeah. i couldn't pass the medical.
anyway...
...i kind of like it here.
i like you...
...just the way you are.
hi, roy.
hi.
gosh, you...
...really got some nice toys here.
this is the friend i was telling you about.
this is my savior, j.f. sebastian.
sebastian.
i like a man that stays put.
you live here all by yourself, do you?
yes.
how about some breakfast?
i was just gonna make some.
excuse me.
well?
leon...
what's going on?
there's only two of us now.
then we're stupid and we'll die.
no, we won't.
no.
knight takes queen, see?
won't do.
why are you staring at us, sebastian?
because...
...you're so different.
you're so perfect.
yes.
what generation are you?
nexus 6.
i knew it.
because i do genetic design
work for the tyrell corporation.
there's some of me in you.
show me something.
like what?
like anything.
we're no computers,
sebastian. we're physical.
i think, sebastian...
...therefore, i am.
very good, pris. now show him why.
we've got a lot in common.
- what do you mean?
- similar problems.
accelerated decrepitude.
i don't know much about
bio-mechanics, roy. i wish i did.
<i>if we don't find help soon...</i>
<i>...pris hasn't got long to live.</i>
we can't allow that.
- is he good?
- who?
- your opponent.
- oh, dr. tyrell?
i've only beaten him once
in chess. he's a genius.
he designed you.
maybe he could help.
i'd be happy to mention it to him.
better if i talk to him in person.
but i understand he's a
sort of hard man to get to.
yes.
very.
will you help us?
i can't.
we need you, sebastian.
you're our best and only friend.
we're so happy you found us.
<i>i don't think there's another human being...</i>
...in the whole world who would've helped us.
trade.
<i>- trade at two...
- blue entry.</i>
<i>a mr. j.f. sebastian.</i>
<i>16417.</i>
<i>at this hour?</i>
<i>what can i do for you, sebastian?</i>
queen to bishop six. check.
nonsense.
just a moment.
queen to bishop six, ridiculous.
queen...
...bishop six.
<i>knight...</i>
<i>... takes queen.</i>
what's on your mind, sebastian?
what are you thinking about?
bishop to king seven.
checkmate.
bishop to king seven. checkmate, i think.
got a brainstorm, huh, sebastian?
milk and cookies kept you awake, huh?
<i>let's discuss this.</i>
<i>you better come up, sebastian.</i>
mr. tyrell?
i...
i brought a friend.
i'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
it's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
and what can he do for you?
can the maker repair what he makes?
would you like to be modified?
stay here.
had in mind something a little more radical.
what...?
what seems to be the problem?
- death.
- death.
well, i'm afraid that's a little
out of my jurisdiction. you...
i want more life...
...father.
the facts of life.
to make an alteration in the...
...evolvement of an organic
life system is fatal.
a coding sequence cannot be
revised once it's been established.
why not?
because by the second day of incubation...
...any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations...
...give rise to revertant colonies
like rats leaving a sinking ship.
then the ship sinks.
what about ems recombination?
we've already tried it.
ethyl methane sulfonate is an
alkylating agent and a potent mutagen.
it created a virus so lethal the...
...subject was dead before he left the table.
then a repressor protein that
blocks the operating cells.
wouldn't obstruct replication, but it
does give rise to an error in replication.
so that the newly formed dna
strand carries a mutation...
<i>...and you've got a virus again.</i>
but this, all of this, is...
...academic.
you were made as well as we could make you.
but not to last.
the light that burns twice
as bright burns half as long.
and you have burned so
very, very brightly, roy.
look at you.
you're the prodigal son.
you're quite a prize.
<i>i've done...</i>
...questionable things.
also extraordinary things.
revel in your time.
nothing the god of biomechanics
wouldn't let you in heaven for.
sorry, sebastian.
