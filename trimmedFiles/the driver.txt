i just didn't get that good a look at him.
you?
she saw him better than i did.
- who?
- she did.
- what do you mean, "she"?
- on the end.
in the black?
is that him?
you can take your time, because
there's no way he can ever get to you...
absolutely no way.
it wasn't him.
you sure?
yeah.
you're positive?
it wasn't him.
how about the rest of you?
guide dogs for everyone, is that it? huh?
planning on looking for work soon?
my line of work is kinda hard to come by.
depends on where you look.
it depends on who you are.
i don't know.
some of the criminal types these days...
they, uh, think that
they're real cowboys...
think that they can
just, uh, drive around...
do whatever they want to do...
whenever they wanna do it.
mm.
i respect a man that's
good at what he does.
i'll tell you something else.
i'm very good at what i do.
now, last night...
oh, i forgot.
his memory's not too good
about last night.
- i remember everything.
- alone in your room?
yeah.
you can do better than that.
i don't have to.
go ahead throw it!
it'll cost you two years.
go on.
you wanna throw it?
go on. go on.
go on.
you know what i'm gonna do?
i'm gonna catch the cowboy
that's never been caught.
cowboy desperado.
now get out of here.
open the door!
can't you open the goddamn door?
you asshole!
can't you even open the door?
drive, you son of a bitch! drive!
watch it! watch that damn truck!
watch it! jesus!
well, well, well.
look what the old van drug in.
what kind of piece did he have?
wow!45.
very nice gun.
you know, that supermarket's
gonna cost you 10 years.
i don't know about any supermarket.
yeah, you do.
why don'tcha come on inside?
- how about a beer?
- i'd rather not, if that's okay by you.
well, it's fine by me.
today's your lucky day.
i'm feeling generous.
i'm gonna give you a choice.
you and your bunch are
gonna do one more job...
a bank, nice big one...
for free.
you're gonna hire a new driver, that's all.
a good one.
i don't work with cops.
oh, gosh.
i wish you hadn't said that.
ow! god damn you!
now, about this bank.
cash on hand: 200,000.
that's bait for the man you're gonna hire.
he does know banks.
you set it up in a week or you're...
yeah, i know all about 10 years.
well, that's the choice.
do 10 years wearing a number...
or trust me...
and walk away free.
- you're getting in pretty deep on this
one, aren't you? - that's my business.
setting up bank jobs? i don't remember
that being part of taking the oath.
we're getting the money back, jerk-off.
and we're catching somebody
that's never been caught.
that's a public service.
how many banks in this city...
get hit every month?
oh, 15, on the average.
how many end up with a collar?
on the average?
about eight or nine.
see there?
we're raising the average.
brilliant.
try to sell that downtown.
i sold it to myself, that's enough.
i want the cowboy.
you wanna play this your way?
fine. you're the boss.
but i'm telling you something:
i'm in this for the win.
you blow this thing then you can
say good-bye to your badge.
you know something? maybe i oughta
investigate your background, huh?
did you ever think of that?
some little item there?
maybe there's something we should
know about. maybe you're a fruiter.
- yeah.
- or maybe you took a bribe.
- i wonder how much it was.
- investigate all you want.
- you'd just be disappointed. - i'm not
gonna take your word for it. how's that?
i got a wife and i got a kid and i got
now, if you think i'm gonna
let you blow that for me, you're crazy.
- think about it.
- i already have...
asshole.
i didn't think you'd be the one to pay me.
kind of taking a chance, aren't you?
i'll pay you here if you want.
come on up.
i've been paid to do a few things before...
but i was never paid to be an alibi.
you're going to ask me why i did it?
i have a friend that pays the rent...
lives out of town...
visits me once or twice a month.
lately the checks haven't been so regular.
i need the money.
hello.
no, i don't think...
he's on his way up to see me.
the cop.
guess that means i can come in.
nice place.
terrific view. ahhh.
you didn't come by to tell me that.
you saw the man who was driving the car.
and you saw the man up
against the brick wall.
and you know it's the same man...
yet you didn't identify him.
are you afraid of him?
no.
are you afraid of me?
no.
i just don't like you.
mm.
you got a reason?
must be because i'm such a good cop.
how old are you?
twenty-two.
i did a little checking.
what else did you check?
well, a young girl like yourself...
you sure have been around the track
a few times, honey.
led a real active life.
get out.
no.
we're gonna do a little
business, you and i.
look at it!
you sure that's not him?
it's not him.
really?
maybe you oughta be afraid of me.
i ran a make on you.
you're clean. no problem.
of course, there was that, uh...
one little scrape.
you remember?
the kinda nasty one.
the one that got swept under the rug.
now, when your memory improves, honey...
give me a call.
no guarantees.
- never has been.
- he might still be down there.
- how'd the new girl work out?
- she did her job.
who did you have pay her off?
i did it myself.
that's not like you.
why am i here?
some people wanna meet.
they're from downtown.
they've done a few jobs.
- shooters.
- yeah.
i told you i don't like guns.
i know. but they're looking to move up.
they got their eyes set
on something special.
they know my price?
everybody knows your price.
even paid me $300 just to get to you.
you did.
how you been?
i'm okay.
you two know each other?
couple of years ago,
we worked a two-car job.
you already have a driver.
he don't have the balls
for driving anymore.
you work for a piece, right?
$10,000 up front...
against 15%.
how do we know you're that good?
get in.
all right!
enough, lunatic. enough of this shit!
all right, all right,
all right, all right!
we believe you! we believe you!
enough! enough! stop, will you?
i mean, for christ's sake!
for christ's sakes!
jesus!
easy, easy.
better get new plates
if you plan on taking it out again.
people might be looking for you.
you're crazy.
we'll make you a deal.
i don't work with people like you.
or him.
this plan of yours for our friend...
taking a little long to set up, isn't it?
gotta be patient, pal.
- ah, i see.
- every job has its problems.
couldn't be you just figured it wrong?
you know something?
i think i'm gonna have to help you
with your education.
this is the quiet part of the hunt.
the trap's all set.
cowboy's out there somewhere.
it wouldn't be any fun
if the cowboy walked into it, would it?
that'd be no fun.
you know the best part of our job is?
it's just a game. it's either them or us.
- maybe me and you.
- oh, no way, jose.
you're not even in my league.
i tell you what, though.
i'm a very generous man.
tell you what i'm gonna do.
i'm gonna help you be a better cop.
you know how?
you know what you do
first thing every morning?
read the sports page.
you know why?
best part of the newspaper.
winners, losers, how it happened, score.
now, we've got a better game
than the one they give the players.
they don't retire us after 10 years.
just one thing.
you gotta be a player...
a real player...
not just filling out a position.
i guess you figure you're a winner.
that's it. and you're a loser.
but i think you'd like to be a winner.
and you're gonna show me the way, huh?
unless, of course,
you turn into a complete asshole first.
let's move.
i just wanna talk.
we need you. you're valuable.
i already gave you guys an answer.
we don't like that answer.
be friendly. do things our way.
go ahead and pull the trigger.
you... you do anything else...
i'll come back.
i'll kill you.
i'm just trying to do my job.
so am i.
go home.
i just wanted to talk.
you did.
- let's talk, okay?
- go ahead.
i'm having a very big
problem with your boy.
he's not too thrilled in working with us.
i can understand that.
look, i don't know what to do.
i'm doing the best i can, you know?
you know what to do.
you just did it.
you came in here
and asked me to save your ass.
that's what i'm gonna do...
save your ass.
guess i can't leave you alone, can i?
guess i'm just a real friendly guy.
a friend of yours told me where i could
find you in the middle of the day.
i don't have any friends.
that's right.
no friends.
no steady job.
no girlfriend.
you live real cheap.
you don't ask any questions.
boy, you got it down real tight.
so tight, there's no
room for anything else.
that's a real sad song.
only trouble is,
sad songs ain't selling this year.
maybe i'm your friend.
present. i brought it for you.
found it on the floorboard
of some ford a cowboy boosted.
go ahead, take it.
save you the trouble of making another one.
i really like chasing you.
sounds like you got a problem.
oh-ho.
i'm much better at this game than you are.
you play against me,
pal, you're gonna lose.
you win, you make some money.
i win, you're gonna do 15 years.
how about it, driver?
my price has doubled.
come on. who do you think you're
dealing with? that's 30% of the take.
that's right. special price because
i'm working with second-raters.
we'll make you a deal.
i want him to say it.
yeah.
one more thing. you're not coming.
you don't give many choices, do you, pal?
that's right.
it's a two-man job inside.
uh, you'll get your cut later.
i don't like it.
that's the whole idea.
boy, it's tough to like
that man, i tell you.
we got him. he's doing the job.
look, i gotta tell you something.
it's very important for you to get this.
hold up your end of this deal.
'cause if i should see any cops at all
in front of that bank, any at all...
there's gonna be a lot
of shooting going on.
now listen to me!
i don't want any shooting.
- got that? got it?
- yeah, i got it.
i just need one thing out of you...
and that's the drop point.
understand?
that way, i get my man, i get the money...
and the money gets back
to the people it belongs to.
straighten up your little corduroy jacket.
now piss off. i'm sick of lookin' at you.
- you really do like to lean, don'tcha?
- it's part of the job, pal.
yeah? it doesn't make things too easy,
lemme tell you.
the man's afraid of heights.
goddamn it! you set the alarm off!
come on! now move!
move, move, move, move, move!
let's go.
- no!
- you triggered the alarm!
you're starting to
scare the shit out of me!
all right, let's move.
i covered him out the back. he's okay.
let's move, all right?
i never thought i'd be standing around,
waiting for this cowboy to make it.
well, you are...
and he will.
you don't have any doubts, huh?
about our desperado?
about your badge.
boy. you are really an
asshole, you know that?
can't get over the mistake you made.
you've been set up, you know?
by a cop.
that's right.
he's waiting for you right now
at the wrong place.
me and my friend don't want to show up.
you two hotshots have both been set up,
haven't you?
you know what always amazed me about you?
a guy with your attitude
never carries a gun.
that's stupid. very stupid.
i want a room. one night, maybe two.
five bucks a night.
i'm expecting someone.
if she shows, send her right up.
hey, you want a tv?
it's a dollar extra.
get on over and keep
your eye our little lady.
right.
forget it.
i'll put an a. p. b. out on all of them.
no, you won't.
what the hell are you talking about?
it's tough doing business with lowlifes.
they're unreliable.
but we got a few moves left.
just, uh, makes the game
a little more interesting, that's all.
yeah, well, i've been watching your moves.
i gotta tell you, i'm
not all that impressed.
no shit?
no shit.
we got a mutiny with this man here!
- shit.
- wait a second.
now, you're still on my team,
and i am your manager.
you do exactly what i
tell you to do, got it?
suit yourself.
now you're talking.
what about the other two?
i haven't seen them.
you better stay out of sight for a while.
there's a cop trying to put this one on me.
the money's hot. i wanna trade it in.
the exchange rate's 4-to-1 at best.
i'll take it. the train station, 9:00.
that sandwich counter by the lockers.
i don't like it.
i didn't think you would.
i'll set it up...
but they won't do it if you're there.
tonight you'll be hotter than the cash.
i'll get somebody.
keep your eye out for those other two.
they'll know i have their money.
i told you, i'm not
gonna get killed for you.
room 3004.
i don't know where he is.
i haven't seen him.
just tell me what you want.
i just set things up.
it's his business what happens after that.
if it was jewelry or bonds,
he might come to me.
but with cash, he doesn't need me.
i won't see him till the next one.
in a hotel downtown.
the doran.
the money's in a locker
at the train station.
that's all.
i warned him.
i told him i wouldn't get killed for him.
sure.
you don't have to play.
if everything goes all right...
i'll have your money by tomorrow morning.
i'll see it through.
i think you're crazy.
put the key in a safe-deposit box
for six months...
then go get the money.
i'm on a streak. i'm gonna play it out.
i'm gonna get it tonight.
i know all about streaks.
every player says,
"this time is different."
maybe we are alike.
no.
when i lose, i just go broke.
you go to jail.
if it wasn't for that cop,
i'd tell you to go ahead.
he's the reason i've got the rush on.
you don't care about the money.
might even send it to him.
sucker's game.
you think... maybe...
you could wait for a while?
coffee.
i'll be right back for my change.
ah, he's about 27, 28 years old.
he's a punk.
looks like theyjust switched keys.
yeah. he's going back
to the lockers right now.
he's wearing one of those cowboy suits.
he's got a beard... a real sleaze-o.
he's exchanging the bag.
black attaché case.
yeah, dirty money for clean.
yeah. he's moving...
headed for the platform.
he's coming your way.
right. i'll stick with him.
shit!
- look at your bag, pal? - all right.
there's just some papers in it.
we'll see.
- how about you then?
- yeah. go ahead. take a look.
- yeah?
- police.
- we're checking all the luggage.
- just a minute.
not just a minute. now!
hey. what the hell are you trying to...
- is that yours?
- it's not mine.
yours?
- is that yours?
- look, man, i'm cool.
- is it yours?
- no!
- do you have one?
- yeah. i gotta bag. it's up here.
- where? where?
- it's gone!
- was it light brown?
- yeah, that's right, man.
you okay, lady?
a man took my purse. he's got the key.
he ran to the other side of the station.
there!
all right. we got trouble. go!
go, go!
let's get out of here!
- look out! look out!
- aaah!
give up.
i just did the driving.
i ain't got no part in anything else.
go home.
- you okay?
- yeah.
i'll see you in a couple of minutes.
gotcha.
what happened?
looks like we both got swindled.
looks like we both got ripped off...
by the exchange man.
lot of crooks around these days.
driver?
sure you don't wanna keep this?
here.
come on.
