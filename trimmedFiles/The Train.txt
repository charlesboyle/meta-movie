we, the makers of this film,
wish to pay tribute
to those french aiilway men,
living and dead,
whose magnificent spirit and
couaige inspired this story.
we wish also
to express our thanks
to the french national aiilways
and the french military forces,
whose wholehearted coopeaition
made this production possible.
achtung!
it was in the clouvet collection, wasn`t it?
it was.
- do you like it?
- need you ask?
this is degenerate art, you know.
as a loyal officer of the third reich,
i should detest it.
i`ve often wondered at
the curious conceit that would attempt
to determine tastes and ideas by decree.
many times over the past four years
i have wanted to thank you.
for not being what you`d expected?
for saving all this. protecting it.
do you feel free to thank me now because
the liberation of paris is so close?
perhaps.
- it`s not necessary.
- i could have been sent away.
someone else brought in
to be in charge of the museum.
perhaps i should thank you.
i was foolish.
i knew of books being burned.
other things.
i was terrified that these would be lost.
a book is worth a few francs.
we germans can afford to destroy those.
we all may not appreciate artistic merit,
but cash value is another matter.
you won`t convince me
that you`re cynical.
i know what these paintings mean to you.
you are a perceptive woman.
(door slams)
we`re removing the paintings.
- pack them carefully.
- where are you taking them?
- to a safe place.
- but no place is as safe as paris.
the city has been declared open.
it won`t be bombed or shelled.
captain.
i want these on the station tomorrow,
crated and ready to be put on the train.
- what about my train?
- it has been cancelled, sir.
- who cancelled it?
- i did.
- who are you?
- labiche, colonel. area inspector.
under my supervision, of course.
since when does a frenchman have
the authority to cancel a german train?
we`re making up a special armament
train, colonel. highest priority.
- whose orders?
- von rundstedt.
military commander, western front.
how soon can my train
be cleared to leave?
as soon as i get another order.
it`s your army, colonel, not mine.
you`ll get the order. have the train ready
this afternoon at 3.30.
(shouting in german)
- heil hitler.
- heil hitler.
i`m calling for general von lubitz.
i want the line
for the field command headquarters.
yes, immediately!
field command headquarters?
general von lubitz`s office calling.
colonel muller, please.
the general cancelled all appointments
not dealing with the evacuation of paris.
- is he in?
- yes, colonel,
but i have orders not to let anyone in...
- what is it, colonel?
- a train i ordered was cancelled.
i`ve been advised your personal
authorisation is now required.
signal from general von rundstedt, sir.
the highway between avranches and
mortain has been cut by the americans.
you can make application
through normal channels.
you once said
normal channels were a trap,
in which to snare officers
who lacked initiative.
what`s your cargo?
i don`t share your enthusiasm for art.
even if i did, it would not
be centred on this degenerate trash.
nor would i expect priority
over vitally needed war transport.
good morning, colonel.
the second ss armoured division
has fallen back towards falaise.
report on their remaining
effective strength.
might it not be unwise to leave a billion
gold reichsmarks in the bank of france?
enough money
to equip ten panzer divisions?
make your point, colonel.
money is a weapon.
the contents of that train are as
negotiable as gold, and more valuable.
i feel berlin would prefer it
in the hands of the third reich.
if conditions at the front become more
critical, i will rescind this authorisation.
- when will you be ready?
- tomorrow morning at 9. 15, major.
come in. come in.
this is mademoiselle villard
from the jeu de paume, the museum.
i brought her with me.
(whistle)
mademoiselle villard has a problem.
- i thought your group might help her.
- it`s not to help me.
you understand?
the paintings belong to france.
- paintings?
- the train you are preparing the colonel.
he`s stealing a load of pictures.
you should hear what they`re worth!
- it`s not just the money.
- what does she want us to do?
- she wants us to blow up the train.
- oh, no! no, you misunderstand.
they must not even be damaged.
they could never be replaced.
they`re not just... here, i have the list.
renoirs, cezannes,
degas, matisse.
he chose very carefully.
only the best. the national heritage.
- what do you want us to do, madame?
- mademoiselle.
well, i thought, perhaps,
if you could just stop the train.
stopping the train
is not simple, mademoiselle.
- you can get killed stopping a train.
- especially if you are french,
and the train is german.
i know. i realise.
but soon paris will be free, isn`t that true?
but if the paintings are not here...
our latest report is that the allies
will be in paris within a week.
maybe three or four days.
waldheim is to get
the train out before that.
can we slow it down? delay it?
what do you think?
we can blow it up. maybe.
put some plastique
under the cars and blow it up.
they`d shoot a few hostages,
but that`s the price you pay.
- are your paintings that important?
- she doesn`t want it blown up.
london agrees the art is important.
anything we can do to save it.
but they leave it up to us.
why not? what can they lose?
this morning we had
four men left in this group.
now we are three. one, two, three.
- bernard?
- we started with 18.
like your paintings, mademoiselle,
we couldn`t replace them.
for certain things, we take the risk.
but i won`t waste lives on paintings.
but they wouldn`t be wasted.
excuse me.
i know that`s a terrible thing to say.
but those paintings are part of france.
the germans want to take them away.
they`ve taken our land, our food.
they live in our houses.
and now they`re trying to take our art.
this beauty,
this vision of life born out of france.
our special vision. our trust.
we hold it in trust. don`t you see?
for everyone. this is our pride.
what we create and hold for the world.
there are worse things
to risk your life for than that.
i`m sorry, mademoiselle.
we can`t help you.
the train goes through his section.
it`s up to him.
don`t you have copies of `em?
excuse me for taking your time.
i respect you for what you are doing.
i hope none of you will be harmed.
- she`s a nice lady.
- what happened to bernard?
i had a cup of coffee
with him early this morning.
they came into the yards
and picked him up, with some refugees.
i saw the whole thing.
they just came into the yards
and picked him up.
i thought we came here
to talk about the armament train.
it`s a big one, huh, labiche?
when does it leave?
they must be desperate
to risk a daylight run.
tell me the schedule.
it`ll arrive at the yards at vaires by 9.45.
five minutes to switch on the engine
and pick up the antiaircraft crews.
it should be on its way
by ten minutes of ten, no later.
it would be nice
if it were delayed for ten minutes.
british planes will hit the yard at vaires
tomorrow morning at ten o`clock.
saturation bombing.
if the train was in the yard at that time...
ten minutes? it won`t be easy.
can you do it?
- at the moment, i`m not sure how.
- that`s up to you.
the planes will bomb
at exactly ten o`clock.
will the train be there or not?
we`ll have it waiting.
i wonder where he`ll be at ten o`clock.
where i`d like to be. in his office.
- i don`t like it.
- who does?
i mean the art train. if the germans want it
so much, maybe we should do something.
forget the art train.
we`ll have enough to do tomorrow.
which reminds me, i`ll need
another engineer for the art train.
- i`ll have to give it to papa boule.
- papa boule?
- not papa boule!
- i have no choice. who else is there?
it`s an easy run. the train doesn`t leave
till dark. it`ll be in germany by morning.
see you later.
don`t just slap the oil on anywhere,
damn it!
look where the hell you`re putting it.
this machine was running
before you were born.
she`s like a woman. if you don`t treat her
just right, she`ll make your life miserable.
take this. do it right, for god`s sake.
because i`ll be back to check
after i`ve had my coffee.
now remember.
a grease job is not a bath.
- papa.
- mm-hm.
a cup.
i see labiche is finally giving you a train.
- and all the way to germany.
- some train.
you see any artillery?
a load that a man can feel is important?
that might change the war, huh?
but the important shipment
goes to the front.
boule.
have you read what`s in those crates?
i don`t believe anything they write.
paintings! open a case.
you`ll find champagne, perfume
and everything else they stole from us.
i`ve talked to one of the truck drivers.
these are paintings.
- so what?
- great art. picasso. gauguin. renoir.
renoir. i used to know
a girl who modelled for renoir.
she smelled of paint.
bourges, you are a good engineer,
you have told me so.
but in matters of culture,
you are sadly deficient.
champagne and perfume
can be replaced. not art.
- these paintings are important.
- really?
the glory of france.
glory of france?
and to think, two days, three at the most,
the allies should be here.
the nazis wouldn`t have the train.
maybe even one day...
- are you the engineer?
- does he look like an engineer?
you will not leave the station tonight.
stand by your engine,
ready to leave at a moment`s notice.
ja, mein korporal.
- pig!
- be careful how you talk to them.
i`m too old to be careful.
- the glory of france.
- huh? oh, yes.
the glory of france.
give me the change in franc pieces.
engineer!
start the engine!
(whistle)
(whistle)
(whistle)
heil hitler.
loaded and ready, sir.
very good, schmidt.
- what time do you leave?
- as soon as it`s dark, sir.
colonel von waldheim!
telephone call, sir.
general von lubitz`s headquarters!
the officer says it`s urgent.
colonel von waldheim speaking.
yes, major.
i`m sorry to hear that. let`s hope
the reverses at the front are temporary.
yes, of course i understand.
the general explained
it might be necessary
to rescind the authorisation for my train.
unfortunately, i can`t help you.
the train left over half an hour ago,
and is now on its way to germany.
please express my regrets to the general.
in view of the fact
that you`ve already left, schmidt,
i think perhaps you`d better get aboard
and order the train out immediately, huh?
- yes, sir!
- have a good trip, schmidt.
start the train! start the train!
move the train!
boule! start the train.
start the train!
(whistle)
(whistle)
uncouple that engine! get it out of here!
- is the armoured engine ready?
- the antiaircraft crews are all aboard.
move your engine. get it out of here!
hey, you! you pig!
- what?
- who did that?
the steam is released
or the engine blows up.
- which do you want?
- you did it on purpose.
what is this?
take your assigned position.
back of the cab.
- everything all right?
- move your engines...
- it`s ok.
- i want this train out of here!
ok.
- what`s going on down there, labiche?
- sabotage.
(whistle)
throw five.
(whistle)
(whistle)
throw eight.
(whistle)
throw ten.
- throw ten.
- it`s stuck!
(whistle)
don`t force it.
- stop!
- hey! hey!
hey! stop!
stop! you`re on the wrong track!
don`t play games with me, labiche.
i know sabotage when i...
what is it?
but i...
give me the switch tower.
(phone rings)
dietrich! what the hell
is going on up there?
you idiot!
you get those switches working!
we have got to get this train out of here!
- i`m tired of your inefficiency, dietrich!
- (air-raid siren)
(whistle)
you can`t ride through an air raid!
watch me! fire up that engine!
(whistle)
you old goat!
get out of there and get under cover!
- get off my train!
- you fool! it`ll rain bombs any second!
get off my train!
- you can`t go! the switch is closed!
- open it!
(bomb whistling)
(explosions)
what is it?
what is it?
- what is it?
- the oil line.
can you fix it?
- can we run it back to vaires?
- maybe, but just the engine.
where`s the phone?
start the pump.
(fire-engine sirens)
the repair of my train
is to take top priority, major.
this whole yard needs repair, colonel.
i`ll see to your engine as soon as i can.
- you`ll see to it at once.
- i have my orders. i`ll do what i can.
i`ve given you an order.
i take full responsibility.
- what happened?
- fault in the oil line.
i`ll take care of it. hand me the spanner.
take over the crane engine.
boule!
boule!
come here.
come here!
- take off the oil caps.
- i`ll do it.
he will do it. go on.
- you can settle the blame for this later.
- one moment, please, sir.
turn out your pants pockets.
slick with oil.
sabotage, colonel.
it`s an old trick around here.
they slip in franc pieces
and cut off the oil supply.
- you should have thrown them away.
- four francs are four francs.
major, please. it`s not important. i`ll have
the engine fixed overnight. i`ll do it myself.
take him away.
colonel! stop them.
wait.
colonel. he slowed up your train
for a few hours but he saved it.
he took it through the bombs
at the risk of his own life.
he`s an old man.
he doesn`t know what he`s doing.
i`ll get your train through for you.
he`s just a foolish old man.
his train! his!
it`s my train.
i know what i`m doing.
do you? huh? you`ll help them.
i practically raised you
but you`re no better than they are.
swine!
colonel! what can you gain
by the death of one old man?
- what he did can make no difference.
- achtung! fire!
you can stop...
you will deliver
that engine to me personally.
i`m holding you responsible.
simon!
turn down the forced-draft.
hurry it up! we`re working on
a locomotive, not a pocket watch!
hubert! take down the grate.
didont... what are you doing here?
- where`s hubert?
- i decided to go along as fireman.
you damn fools.
you lookin` to be shot too?
- papa boule wanted it stopped.
- papa boule! papa boule is dead!
- stop acting like children.
- don`t be mad, paul. we want to do this.
listen, you idiots.
the war`ll be over in a few days.
now leave it alone.
you get caught up in something...
you can`t leave it alone.
- you know how it is.
- (didont) we`ll get away with it, paul.
all contacts have been made except
at metz, and you have to call metz.
maurice won`t go along with us
until he talks to you.
oh, you know maurice. he`s stubborn.
to hell with you. to hell with both of you.
you wanna be killed, i can`t stop you.
we will be killed if you don`t call maurice.
labiche! are you taking the night off?
it`ll be ready in a couple of hours,
by morning. i`ll take it through after dark.
when it`s ready get it out of here.
deliver it.
- in broad daylight?
- deliver it.
that engine has blocked work
on four trains for the front.
the colonel gave orders for it
to be given top priority. he`s got it.
for all i care, it could be shot full
of holes, and his precious train with it.
move it!
(aircraft approaches)
spitfire.
(gunfire)
- no! no, didont!
- not us! not us!
not us! not us!
(gunfire)
(brakes screech)
(whistle)
this is the last job. the last one.
when we get to rive-reine,
i`ll make that call to maurice.
- what happened?
- allied aircraft, ten miles back.
any serious damage?
any serious damage?!
not enough to stop you
from getting to germany.
camouflage the engine. schwarz!
- your engine and your crew.
- was it your clever idea
to risk this engine in a daylight run?
major herren was following
your orders to the letter.
i admire your efficiency, labiche,
and your sense of survival.
i don`t suppose you have much trouble
with saboteurs, do you?
tell me, labiche. do you think there
will be sabotage attempts on this train?
i`m a railroad man, not a prophet.
prophecy is not required,
only determination.
this train will get through to germany.
you agree, don`t you, labiche?
what do you want me to do, colonel?
give you a guarantee?
i`ll settle for a partial guarantee.
you, labiche.
you`ll drive the engine.
the engineer`s been assigned.
my orders are to return to vaires.
stay with the engine. keep steam up.
you can go now. you`re not needed.
i`ve worked all night on this engine.
i haven`t slept for two days. i`ll fall asleep.
you`ll leave at seven o`clock.
i think you should rest until then.
take him to the hotel. he is to stay
there until he returns here at seven.
sleep well.
my bicycle.
your transportation to paris.
danke.
a room for this man.
identity card, please.
- 60 francs.
- pay her.
you pay her.
i`m a guest of the german army.
- he is a railroad man.
- 60 francs.
- isn`t there a discount for railroad men?
- 60 francs.
top of the stairs, first door on the right.
the sheets are clean.
labiche!
you heard the colonel - seven o`clock.
get some rest.
would like to tuck me in?
call me at 6.45.
pesquet.
one german in the office with jacques.
give me about two minutes.
where are you going?
back in the engine. use your coal pile.
- what started this?
- we don`t know, sir.
you aren`t all needed.
get back to the train.
- where`s labiche?
- i put him in the hotel, sir.
a few minutes ago.
- sergeant!
- you two, come!
- labiche!
- (knock on door)
break it down.
look in the cellar!
- why are you breaking down my door?
- labiche, where is he?
(woman)
who`s your commanding officer?
captain!
mademoiselle, come here!
how long has he been here?
since soup, cabbage and potatoes.
thank you.
i don`t want your thanks. if they`d caught
me helping you, i would have been shot.
i know. i`m sorry.
you think you can run in here
and make trouble?
i run a hotel, not a madhouse. who`s
going to pay for the door and the lock?
do you think money grows on trees?
- there`s a war.
- you talk about the war.
i`ll talk about what it costs.
i`ll be leaving in a few hours.
you can go back to your good customers.
they pay. that`s what i`m in business for.
you should be paid.
- how much for the damage?
- 100 francs.
how much for saving my life?
who did it?
i`m not sure. i can`t remember.
i was struck!
you`re lying!
enough, pilzer.
if you tell the truth, you`ll live.
now, what does he look like?
colonel, i can`t remember!
a big man.
a grey suit.
a hat, i think.
sir, labiche never left the hotel.
let him go.
do you want some coffee?
it goes with the room.
no extra charge.
what`s your name?
labiche, the colonel is waiting.
christine.
did you get through?
- jacques, is the track all clear up ahead?
- all the way to germany.
(colonel) sleep well, labiche?
like a baby, colonel.
i trust this time
the bearings are well-oiled?
why don`t you check them yourself?
sergeant!
sergeant schwarz will ride with you.
the last town before
entering germany will be st avold.
you will stop there for captain schmidt
to telephone a report to me.
a pleasant trip, captain.
is that clear?
i will stop at st avold.
have you ever been to germany,
labiche?
no, colonel.
you should find
the experience interesting.
a chance to broaden your horizon.
all right, stationmaster.
(blows whistle)
just keep out of my way.
stop at st avold,
we`ll get our heads blown off.
get me commercy, please.
i don`t have a direct line.
this is railroad business!
- what`s the matter?
- your army regulations.
montmirail.
chalons.
hello, metz? it`s on time.
hello, metz? rive-reine.
is that you, maurice?
where is he?
when will he be back?
have him call jacques at rive-reine
as soon as possible.
yes, it`s important.
thank you.
- what time will you be home, uncle?
- when i get home, i`ll be home!
i`m sitting enjoying myself! drinking,
playing cards, having a good time.
you can see that, can`t you?
aunt helene wanted to know.
robert.
i`m a bad-tempered old man.
- why are we slowing down?
- are you blind? there`s been an air raid.
we slow down for switching.
what are you going to do?
i don`t want to stop at st avold.
you wanna go to germany?
jacques will send word.
(whistle)
this is taking us south.
i said this is taking us south!
you saw the main tracks are blown up.
we have to go around
the bend in the river.
- what`s the next town on your map?
- remilly.
keep your eyes open.
your horizon`s about to be broadened.
(phone rings)
rive-reine.
ah, maurice.
you have a direct line to commercy.
right. call them.
my wife`s cousin
has some cheese for me.
could be put on the midnight train
when it stops at commercy.
yes. yes, maurice.
the train will stop, to unload passengers.
good. i`ll save a piece of cheese for you.
railroad business, huh?
(train whistle)
next stop, st avold, sir.
do we run?
sergeant. can we stretch our legs?
all right. get down.
corporal, watch them.
you! where`s the telephone?
sergeant! nobody leaves the train.
we will stop here only for two minutes.
ja, kapitan.
and to save a piece for pierre and raoul.
hello, colonel.
colonel, we are at st avold.
yes, colonel.
what`s it like here in st avold?
well?
i know what you mean.
i`ll be glad to get back to berlin.
- schwarz!
- yes, captain?
- we go.
- get up.
auf wiedersehen.
(whistle)
(whistle)
we are home, tauber.
we are in germany.
(whistle)
- are you all right?
- yes, i`m all right.
you`re crazy! why did you
speed into a curve like that?
- but you told me to go ahead.
- yes, but at full speed?
what do you mean? hey! you should have
signalled to go slow! how should i know?
look at my rails!
how close?
two minutes.
good luck.
if we get separated, meet you
at the old farmhouse above the river.
take the stick.
halt!
(shouting)
(sirens)
pilzer! get labiche!
yes, sir.
get him! kill him, kill him!
kill him! kill him!
kill him! kill him!
kill him! kill him!
(sirens)
no. no, you can`t stay here.
fire!
pilzer!
- how soon will the cranes be here?
- major herren is on his way now, sir.
everything else will be
completed by dark...
put more men to work.
i want it done faster.
but, colonel, till the crane
can move the engine...
yes, colonel.
sir! no sign of labiche, sir.
we searched the woods for hours.
- i`ve had two squads looking...
- i want him!
- he could have gone back to paris.
- no.
he`s around somewhere, i know.
he`ll twist and turn.
he`ll hide and make his plans.
but he won`t leave the train.
i`m beginning to know him.
keep looking for him! search the town.
(door closes)
i`ve brought you some clothes.
- how`s your leg?
- much better, thank you.
(men shouting orders)
- what`s going on out there?
- you should know.
engines and cars all over the tracks.
rails torn.
- any reprisals?
- do you think they`d declare a holiday?
jacques, the stationmaster,
and an engineer shot.
another engineer, the thin one,
was shot trying to escape.
pesquet.
- there`ll be others.
- (door opens)
(banging)
labiche.
have you seen the man labiche?
- labiche?
- yes, labiche!
- he was in room five. he left yesterday!
- yes, he left yesterday.
i know he left yesterday!
i want to know if you`ve seen him today!
labiche, labiche.
yes, i`ve seen labiche.
i see him every day.
and general de gaulle too.
they`re my best customers
and i keep them cool in the wine cellar.
please.
why did you come back here?
do you want everyone killed?
maybe you think you`re a hero.
maybe you don`t care if you live.
what right have you to do this?
leave us alone.
i knew jacques all my life.
helene, his wife, sat with me
when my husband was killed,
the first year of the war.
and now i`ll sit with her.
men are such fools.
men want to be heroes
and their widows mourn.
perhaps men are fools.
there were over a hundred involved
in stopping that train.
switchmen, brakemen,
yard gangs, stationmasters.
god knows how many will be shot,
like jacques.
you know what`s on that train?
paintings. that`s right - paintings. art.
the national heritage.
the pride of france.
crazy, isn`t it?
it`s quiet up there.
where are you going?
perhaps i can leave now.
you can`t go out in daylight.
they`re looking for you.
my friend who was with me on the train,
i have to meet him. he may not be alive.
it won`t help him if you`re killed.
wait until it`s dark.
eat your food.
it`s a sin to waste bread.
ready? take it up.
put it on its side over there.
major!
can`t you move any faster?
this is a hell of a mess you`ve got here,
colonel. we`re doing the best we can.
i asked for two cranes.
it took an order by staff headquarters
to get this one.
with von rundstedt falling back, the army
has other uses for railway equipment.
this train is more valuable.
it`s all right.
(german voices)
at commercy,
they shot the stationmaster.
at metz, they took hostages.
ten of them. shot them on the spot.
kids, mostly.
you know lefevre, the inspector there?
his kid, the one with asthma?
they cured it for him.
at chalons, three dead.
that`s all i know so far.
pesquet was right.
this was his last job.
what about the train?
it`ll be ready to move tomorrow.
where the hell are the allies?
what are they taking,
the tourist route to paris?
i`ll believe them when i see them.
in case they don`t come.
(footsteps)
labiche, it`s me!
- who`s with you?
- robert, jacques` nephew.
come in.
i`m glad to see you`re still alive.
you`re to be complimented.
- that was quite a job you did.
- where are the allies?
what shape is the train in?
it`ll be repaired by morning.
thank you.
- when does it leave rive-reine?
- it won`t move in daylight.
where are the allies?
it has been arranged for a french division
to reach paris first. a gesture.
a gesture?
they can make gestures?
let them make one
for pesquet or jacques.
that kid of lefevre`s,
he`d appreciate a gesture.
what do you intend to do?
this - plastique. what we should
have done in the first place.
tomorrow night - no allies,
we blow the train to hell.
london wants the train saved.
what do they want us to do? stop it with
our hands? lay down across the tracks?
right after dawn, all switching tracks
and trains in the area will be bombed.
the art train is not to be destroyed.
orders are to mark it
so the planes will pass it up.
- mark it?
- white paint...
on the top of the first three cars.
london has decided the paintings
must not be damaged.
save it?
for von waldheim? make him a present?
to hell with london. we started
this whole thing for one reason.
to stop the train
because the allies were going to be here.
where are they?
every day they`ve been due.
every day, a man has died for thinking
they were about to arrive. to hell with it!
now they want us to paint the train?
let `em blow it up!
paul.
it`d be too bad if it got blown up.
that is, if it could be saved.
papa boule, pesquet, the others...
they wanted it saved.
and they`re dead, and they`ll never know.
but we will.
white paint. just the first three cars.
i can find my way back.
you know what it`s like down there?
there are germans all over the place.
you haven`t got a chance!
i`ll figure something.
what do you wanna do? tell the germans
you want to paint the train
so it will look nice
when it gets to germany?
don`t you see? it`s hopeless.
those cars have been needing a coat
of paint ever since the war started.
you crazy bastard.
who are you gonna get to help you?
have you thought of that?
who are you gonna get to help you?
me.
i can fight.
that`s two of us. a small army.
- what do you shoot with this?
- rabbits.
you`re not fighting rabbits.
- how well do you know the station?
- have you got a plan?
- i lived there all my life.
- can you get some men to help?
not in rive-reine. they`re working on
the tracks. even i serve food to the army.
other towns?
montmirail. uncle jacques had friends
there - railroad men. i can get them.
- and paint?
- yes. and brushes too.
see about the men and the paint.
be back an hour before dawn.
with luck...
no one will be hurt.
no one`s ever hurt. just dead.
paul, have you ever seen
any of those paintings on the train?
i haven`t. when it`s over,
i think maybe we should take a look.
(air-raid siren)
pilzer!
herren!
lights!
pilzer!
didont, get out! get out!
(german voices)
(gunfire)
didont! run, run!
(distant rumbling)
not thunder, colonel. artillery.
- how close?
- ten miles, perhaps 15.
our guns falling back, retreating.
- when will you be finished?
- half an hour.
does it matter?
you can`t take the train out in daylight.
the allies could be here before night.
possibly.
but a moving train has no chance.
(air-raid siren)
colonel, get down! get down!
why?
the paint, herren. it`s a signal.
they`re not going to bomb the train.
don`t scrape it off. leave it there.
it`s my ticket to germany.
(whistle)
(train chugs)
(train approaches)
after him! search the woods!
wait! colonel,
while they search the woods,
labiche can blow another section
of the train, and another and another.
do you suggest he will stop
if we let him run free?
he would have blown up the engine. the
hostages you put aboard prevented that.
i can have this repaired
in less than an hour.
keep labiche away from the train
for the next four or five miles,
till we reach montmirail,
then we will leave him behind.
labiche or the train.
which do you want, colonel?
(shouts in german)
stop!
bring over the rails!
(barks orders)
(whistle)
(whistle)
come here.
i think i saw something.
(train chugs)
(whistle)
stop here!
i`ll ride the front to montmirail.
(whistle)
ten miles a hour, no more.
stop! stop! stop!
major!
yes, colonel?
can we get this back on the rails?
the crane is in paris by now.
without a crane, impossible.
nothing is impossible!
get the men to work!
i want this engine back on the rails!
if we had ten times as many men
it couldn`t be done.
i tell you it will!
do you hear me? i tell you it will!
it`s hopeless, colonel.
unload those paintings!
all of you, unload them at once!
go on, now, schwarz.
- get to work! unload the crates!
- stop!
come on, hurry up!
stop!
stop! stop!
- get your men off the trucks, lieutenant.
- we have orders...
orders, i don`t care about your orders.
do as i say!
off the trucks!
off the trucks!
come on!
off the trucks!
move back! move back!
back in the trucks! back in the trucks!
what the hell`s going on here?
i need your trucks, major. i have
an important cargo to deliver to germany.
a french armoured division
is over that hill. what about my men?
i don`t care about your men!
i order you to unload those trucks!
save your orders, colonel.
in this sector the war is over.
- back in the trucks!
- i`ll have you shot!
back in the trucks!
herren! shoot that man!
he is to be executed
for gross insubordination!
unload the trucks!
herren! i gave you an order!
we have lost, colonel.
it`s hopeless.
look at those men.
a defeated army.
lost, herren?
lost?
yes.
come on!
- you want transport?
- thank you.
- i have 50 men.
- tell them to move fast.
schwarz! bring the men on the double!
we are moving out!
grote, get the men in the trucks.
we are moving out.
in the trucks!
drop the paintings
and get in the trucks!
gunther!
stop.
colonel.
- you go on, herren.
- there is nothing to stay for, colonel.
you`re a good officer, herren.
i`ll be along in a few minutes.
there`ll be other trucks.
labiche!
here`s your prize, labiche.
some of the greatest paintings
in the world.
does it please you, labiche?
do you feel a sense of excitement
in just being near them?
a painting means as much to you
as a string of pearls to an ape.
you won by sheer luck.
you stopped me without knowing
what you were doing, or why.
you are nothing, labiche.
a lump of flesh.
the paintings are mine.
they always will be.
beauty belongs to the man
who can appreciate it.
they will always belong to me
or to a man like me.
now, this minute,
you couldn`t tell me
why you did what you did.
