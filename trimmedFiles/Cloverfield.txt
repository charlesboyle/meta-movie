we're going… we're just going
around the corner to the store!
l want you to go around
with your brother's camera
and get testimonials from everyone.
why?
l mean, it's not like this is a wedding.
l know it's not a wedding.
l said like a wedding.
l can't get this.
l don't get… l mean,
l don't understand why l have to do it.
'cause, l mean, l don't…
l don't even know how to work this…
— that's what l think is gonna happen.
— no, l'm not!
— you totally are. you…
— you have no clue!
okay, well, let me ask you a question.
can you see me through the viewfinder?
yeah. got you.

to carry these bags all by myself?
you're doing a great job.
here, practise doing two things at once.
— that's good! that was good.

l'm not lugging this thing around
— all night long.
— he is your brother.
this is important. stop freaking out.
l understand that, lily, but it's a shit job!

l was just kidding! come on!
hud? hud, listen to me.
l got a job for you.
l already have got a job.
— l'm doing the sign, so…
— yeah, no. l see that,
but this is more important than the sign.
you know how, like, at weddings,
people give testimonials
to the camera, right?
no.
all right. you're gonna take the camera
and just, you know, go around the party
and film people wishing rob good luck.
l don't know, man.
— that's a lot of responsibility.
— this is important.
and then you have
to do it the whole night…
and marlena's gonna be here.
— she is?
— oh, yeah. she is.
— so you're gonna take that.
— oh, hold on.
— and you're gonna talk to her…
— l didn't…
— for rob.
— l didn't say l would do it.
— just try it out.
— all right, l'll do a few.
you can, just do mine…
— are you ready?
— yeah, go.
all right.
rob, l don't even know what to say, bro.
best of luck in japan.
l love you so much,
and l'm proud of you.
— that's it.
— that's it?
— yeah. easy enough.
— yeah. lt's actually kind of fun.
— you enjoy it, hud.
— thanks, man.
yeah, l'm doing…
hey, what's up, man?
hey, guys? hey.
— what do we say?
— anything.
bon voyage, rob.
or however you say that in japanese.
yeah, good.
oh, yeah, all right. oh, yeah…
— hud, what are you doing?
— l'm documenting the night.
but l thought l asked jason to do that.
oh, yeah, well, jason asked me to do it,
so l've been doing it.
l've been doing it really well.
well, are you gonna
take it seriously, though?
because it's really important.
no, of course. l've been taking it
really, really seriously.
— very seriously.
— you promise?
yeah, you wanna do
your testimonial now?
— okay.
— yeah, do it right now.
okay.
okay, just open up to him,
'cause this is gonna be
— the last thing he sees you…
— okay, hud, l got it.
robert hawkins,
l can't believe you're leaving me
to look after your brother by myself.
oh! easy, easy. l mean
l'm obviously standing right here…
and l know we're not officially family,
yet, but…
— not fair, 'cause l'm gonna…
— dude.
— okay.
— l'll cut him out later.
but l think of you as my brother,
and l hope you think of me as a sister.
so, you better call us.
now that you have this job,
you can afford to call us, so…
— hud?
— yeah.
yeah, sorry. no, you're good.
you're good. you're good.
— that was good!
— that's it?
l thought that was really, really good.
yeah, but you weren't even paying
attention for…
okay. okay, you can do this.
yeah. you got this, man. you got this.
— what's up, man?
— hey, what's up, dude?
what's up?
excuse me! hey, marlena?
— hey, what's up?
— hi. hi.
hey, did you know that l'm going around
the party and l'm…
do you know rob's leaving?
— like it's his going-away party.
— yeah. yeah.
cool. hey, so we're taping,
l think, people talking about him.
oh, no, thank you.
l barely even know rob.
l'm just coming to say hi to lily,
so it's a little weird,
if l'm even on it, l think, but thanks.
okay, cool,
except l'm supposed to get everybody.
so have you ever been to a wedding?
no, l get what you're doing. l just…
l don't want to do it, but thank you.
okay, cool.
we'll just do a short one real quick.
okay.
hey, rob, marlena.
l think we've met, like,
probably three times before, total,
and every one of those times
l was really drunk,
so l don't really even know what to say.
but you have a cool job!
that's something!
— like you're president of something!
— vice president!
also really cool.
so good luck with that
and we're gonna be here
keeping new york really safe
and fun for you when you come back.
— cool, that was a really good one.
— yeah?
yeah, we can do
another one if you want.
do you actually have,
like a card or something?
well, my agency… we're leaving.
we're going on this stupid retreat
and they like all this video,

no, no, no, hud.
l'm rob and lily's friend.
— we met, like, several times before.
— oh, yeah, yeah.
yeah, you have the camera
in front of your face,
— it's probably why l didn't…
— okay, here. lf l move it?
— oh, yeah. what's going on? totally.
— yeah.
yeah, cool. lt's nice to see you again.
— really good to see you. really good.
— so what have you been up to?
l actually… l'm gonna just go
grab some food,
but good luck with the…
l could still do your
agency's retreat if you wanted…
he's coming up the stairs right now.
everybody get ready. get ready.

yeah. wait, were we supposed
to get presents?
— they did. they had sexual intercourse.
— what?
— lily told me.
— no way.
— no, you are so…

l could talk to him now.
dude, you already talked
to the whole party!
— … have to do something.
— no. everyone needs to just calm down
— and give him space.
— he's just gonna stay
— locked in his room all night?
— lily, look at you.
— lt's fine, trust me.
— lt is not fine.
— lt is fine.
— you are his brother.
you are his best friend.

so, how do you wanna do this?
do you wanna do most of the talking,
or do you want me
to do most of the talking?
— you're not doing any talking.
— okay, cool.
we got to talk.
you don't know
what you're talking about,
— all right?
— okay, well, then tell me.
lt was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.
yeah, well, beth told lori
that after you guys got together,
— you totally blew her off.
— l didn't blow her off!
she said you never called her.
look, l'm leaving, all right?
so what am l supposed to do?
l don't know, man.
she was heartbroken.
look, there's no «together.» lt's just
her and me, two separate things.
lt's better if we just stay friends.
… not that l feel like l'm not
good enough for her!
no, stop, stop!
l didn't say «feel,» rob.
you're not good enough for her.
that's it. that's fact. that's science.
beth mclntyre is, like,
from a whole 'nother planet, man.
she's beautiful. she's charming.
and you… l love you,
but let's face it,
you're kind of a douchebag.
and going to japan is not gonna fix that.
she's crazy about you, bro.
— like, right now, as you are.
— and you're in love with her.
— but you got to go after her.
— lt's not that simple.
— no, it is that simple, rob.
— come on, man. don't be scared.
lt's about moments, man.
that's all that…
you got to learn to say,
«forget the world,»
and hang on to the people
that you care about the most.
oh, god. oh, god. oh, my god.
what the hell was that?
that scared the shit out of me.
lil! lil!
did you feel that?
lt was like an earthquake.
— you guys…
— lil, where are you?
— what was that?
— what was that?
— hey. are you all right?
— oh, my god.
— yeah, that was really scary.
— did you see anything?

all right, here we go. here we go.
here we go. here we go.

— ls this the only lights that went out?
— l think they blew up the trains.
— no, a couple did.
— some stayed on.

of troops and equipment,
and they're trying to get everyone
to ieave the area…
to be honest, tom, your guess
is as good as mine at this point.
there appears to be
something coming off of it.
and the ground seems
to be covered in debris…
lt looks like there's something
falling of it, doesn't it?
yes. yes. yes, it does.
there are pieces falling
aii over the street.

you can't possibly think
that this is a good idea.
rob! rob!

rob, hold up!
look, l'm sorry. hey, listen to me. man.

— okay. okay. oh, god damn.
— oh, shit.
what the hell was that?
— oh, shit. oh, shit.
— did you see that?
— oh, my god. oh, god.
— did you see that?
okay.
hey, look. we can just cross…
we can just cross to the other platform,
then go up the stairs and see
if the other side of the street…
rob, the other side of the street
looks the same as this side!
we can wait for there to be a lull,
and then make a break for it!
rob, the air caught on fire! okay?
there's not gonna be a lull!
but if we wait on the other…
listen to me, man,
l am with you, okay? l really, really am.
l'm just saying, you gotta listen
to what's going on up there.
— we can't…
— rob, he's right, okay?
we have to wait. we have to wait.
this is insane.
shit!
— oh, god.
— what? rob, what?
hey, mom.
yeah, no. l'm okay. okay, yeah, we are.
we're being evacuated right now.
the army's here.
we're being evacuated, so don't worry.
okay, but mom… mom, listen.
we tried to get out of the city,
and we took the brooklyn bridge,
and we were right there when it hit.
jason's dead. jason's dead, mom.
l don't know what to say to him.
you know?
like, l feel like l should say something,
but l don't know what to say.
l'm not even supposed to be here.
you didn't have to be. l mean,
you had your chance in the alley.
you could've left us.
yeah, you were supposed to meet up
with some friends or something, right?
yeah.
l'm sorry.
— this isn't a bad idea.
— just walk.
— wait, so then…
— what's going on?
l don't know.
— … just go across here.
— that's good.
yeah. this is the six.
rob, l don't think the trains
are running right now, man.
— no, we can just walk the track, see?
— yeah.
look. beth lives here, columbus circle.
we can just walk down the six
to lexington and then walk down
— central park south.
— you want us to walk in the tunnels?
lt's either that or stay here.
l'll walk the tunnels.
l can't see.
— lt's kind of freaking me out, you know?
— l think there's a light on the camera.
— let me see.
— there is?
yeah, right here. see?
okay.
ocean is big, dude.
all l'm saying is a couple of years ago,
they found a fish in madagascar
that they thought
— had been extinct for centuries.
— so what?
lt's been down there this whole time,
and nobody noticed?
sure. maybe it erupted
from an ocean trench, you know?
or a crevasse. crevice.
lt's just a theory.
l mean, for all we know,
it's from another planet and it flew here.
— like superman?
— yeah, exactly like…
wait. you know who superman is?
oh, my god.
you know who superman is?
— okay, l'm not…
— l'm, like, feeling something.
— are you aware of garfield?
— a lot of people think
he's from a planet
that he's not actually from.
l just can't stop thinking about how
the last thing l said to her was,
«good luck tonight, travis.»
she knows you didn't mean that.
when l think of some of the things
l said to jason…
— no, that's different.
— why?
jason knew you loved him.
hey, do you guys remember
a couple of years ago, when that guy
was lighting homeless people
on fire in the subways?
— jesus, hud.
— what?
lt's maybe not the best topic
for conversation down here.
right.
l just can't stop thinking how scary
it would be if a flaming homeless guy
— came out of the dark right now.
— hud, seriously.
— seriously.
— l'm just saying. sorry.
— what was that?
— let's just keep moving.
holy shit! oh, god, this is nasty.
this is disgusting.
they're all running
in the same direction.
— yeah, like they're running away.
— from what?
hey, how much farther?
l don't know.
let's get out at the next station.
— okay?
— yeah.
did you guys hear that?
— what is that?
— just listen.
l don't see anything. do you guys?
— oh, man, this is the worst.
— will you be quiet for five seconds?
— oh, turn on the night vision.
— what?
— what do you mean?
— lt's right here.
l got it. lt's right here. there.
ls it on?
— oh, shit.
— what? what?
— run. okay, run. okay, run.
— what?
hey, let's start running! just run!
just run! just start running right now!
start running now! run, run, run! run!
just run!
— lily!
— you guys!
wait.
oh, god! help!
please help! you guys, help!
marlena! here!
come on. let's go!
let's go! let's go! let's go!
hud!
— … there you go.
— totally not what l was thinking…
how are you doing over there, marlena?
you okay?
you tell me.
how does it look?
looks like it hurts.
what do you mean? you're saying
this isn't attractive, like, at all?
a little bit.
— here. here, here. you can wash it off.
— thanks.
here. did it get you, hud?
did it bite you, man?
no, it didn't get me.
okay. okay.
hey. hey.
so those things
came out of nowhere, right?
— yeah.
— oh, man.
that one that grabbed me,
it was trying to drag me away.
what's up with that?
— maybe it liked you, hud.
— yeah.
maybe it was trying
to make me its queen.
hey, thanks for coming back
and helping me out, you know?
what? you think that l'm the kind
of person that wouldn't do that?
no. no. l know you aren't.
l was just saying, like, l'm glad you did.
otherwise,
l would have been totally dead.
right?
lt's okay. you just got bit.
hey.
marlena's hurt pretty bad, you know?
well, we could wait here
for a little bit, l guess,
and just hope those things
don't make it through the door.
— yeah, okay. what's the next option?
— well.
okay, we could see
what's out through this way.
— maybe find another tunnel.
— no, no more tunnels.
then, l don't know.
we try our luck up top.
okay, just to be clear,
so our options are
die here, die in the tunnels,
or die in the streets. ls that…
— yeah, pretty much.
— … pretty much the summing up of it?
but wait, we don't even know
where we are, right?
so, let's just go up and look around.
see if we recognise anything.
do you think you'll be okay to walk?
— no, l'm fine. l'm fine.
— here, l'll help you.
— we're at 59th.
— we're at 59th.
— yeah.
— we're at 59th.
that's weird.
what?
yeah.
hello!
marlena?
— what's wrong?
— are you okay?
l'm really… l'm dizzy.
yeah. do you wanna
sit down for a second?
— no, l'm fine.
— she needs a doctor.
— you sure?
— l'm totally fine.
you know, 'cause we could
sit down if you want to.
no, l'm fine, l'm fine.
we've got civilians!
are there any more of you?
— no, just us four.
— lt's just us.
we got four civilians here.
— okay, bring them in.
— roger.
— let's go, move. move it.
— okay, okay.
— let's go!
— okay, okay.
excuse me, sir? sir? excuse me.
listen, we need your help.
our friend, she's hurt. she's trapped
in her building right by here,
at columbus circle.
that is not
where you wanna be right now.
do you guys know what it is? out there?
do you know what that thing is?
lf they know, they ain't telling me.
whatever it is, it's winning.
— what's up?
— we got another bite here.
don't look at that. gross.
— please, we can't stay here. we have…
— hey, not now.
— copy that.
— sir, we have two f-1 8s
on route from selfridge.
four more are arming up,
— maybe 30 minutes out.
— roger that.
listen up, people.
rack them and pack them.
— we're phantoms in 1 5.
— sir.
— where the hell did you find them?
— they were in the tunnels.
yeah, we had to walk all the way
from spring street.
get them ready for transport,
put them on the evac chopper.
— yes, sir. let's move. move, move.
— no, wait. wait.
— listen, our friend is very badly hurt.
— move it.
— move. move.

just listen for a second, please!
turn that goddamned camera…
— we've been trying to get to her all…
— make our own way.
— no, do you have a…
— l am not jeopardising this operation,
— or my men.
— l don't want your help.
you are getting on that chopper now.
l just need you to listen to me
for one second, sir.
— you have no idea what's out there.
— l don't care what's out there.
listen to me. she's dying.
there is nothing l can do
about that now.
the girl that l love more than anything
is dying and it's my fault.
she should have been with me tonight,
and l let her go and…
and l get it, okay?
you have your hands full. l get that.
l get that, but we're gonna go after her,
and if you wanna stop me,
— then you're gonna have to shoot me.
— hud.
— l don't feel so good.
— oh, shit.
— bite! we've got a bite!
— marlena.
— hold on a second.
— get her moving.
keep moving!
hey, marlena, are you okay?
hey, what are you guys doing?

marlena! hold on a second!
— just wait a… let go of me! stop it!
— no.
god! please, god!
where are you taking marlena?
wait a second.
lt's over. there is nothing you can do.
there is nothing you can do
for her now. lt is over. lt's over.
— rogers, clear out of here.
— you sure?
l'll get them to the choppers from here.
— let's move out.
— oh, my god.
what just happened?
let's go. l shouldn't be doing this shit.
— come on. come on.
— okay.
— let's go. move.
— okay, okay.
let's go, move. come on.
you gotta listen to me.
this girl, her building,
it's at columbus circle?
— yeah?
— lf you wanna go out in this,
l ain't gonna stop you.
but you gotta know something.
the government's considering
the hammer down protocol,
which means they're willing
to let this whole area go.
— you mean midtown?
— no, l mean manhattan.
come on. we're taking
one last shot at this thing.
— oh, god.
— lf that doesn't work,
they're levelling
the whole goddamned city.
— your watch is still working?
— yeah?
all right. the airlifts are leaving
from 40th and park.
last chopper's wheels-up
at exactly 0600.
lf you can make it there,
then they'll get you out.
— okay. okay, thank you.
— 58th street's right there.
— now, go. move, move, move.
— let's go.
— let's go.
— go, go, go.
— this is like a nightmare, you know.
— lt all happened so fast,
l couldn't even really see
what happened to her.
l mean, did you see it?
could you see what happened, hud?
no, her eyes started bleeding, and then
they were screaming she was bitten.
and then she wouldn't stop bleeding.
and then…
hud.
— you okay?
— yeah, l'm okay. l'm okay.
look, guys, l don't mean to be…
but we don't have a lot of time.
okay, so maybe you guys
should just stay here, and l'll go.
all right?
— l'm sorry. l just…
— no, no, we're coming. we're coming.
are you sure?
no, no, man.
no, we have to do this, okay?
we're with you. let's go.
let's go. let's go right now.
— oh, my god. oh, my god.
— what?
— oh, my god.
— what is it? what?
— shit.
— that's not beth's place, is it?
— oh, my god.
— ls that beth's apartment?
— oh, my god.
— rob. ls that her place?
— tell me that's not her place.
— that's her place, yeah.
oh, shit. l don't suppose
she lives on the ground floor.
no, 39th.
— oh, great.
— how do we even get up there?
l don't know. we just go inside
and then see how high we can get.
l don't know if l can do that.
well, maybe we could try going up
the other building,
and then see if there's a place
to cross over onto her roof.
and then we could find some way
down to her place.
wait. no, never mind.
no, that's a bad idea.
hey, that's a bad idea. l take that back.
no one ever listens to me, ever.
and now, of course, they listen to me.
great.
shit. shit.
probably not working.
— what's going on?
— not working.
wait, wait. let's just… maybe…
— no? no?
— shit.
well, why don't you take the stairs?
you guys see that guy's face
when lily asked him what it was?
l mean, they have no idea.
— unless they're, like, in on it.
— jesus, hud.
l don't read the papers.
— maybe our government made this thing.
— oh, yeah.
l mean, you know,
maybe it was an accident,
— or maybe it was on purpose…
— sure, maybe they did.
— does it really matter right now?
— yeah.
lt matters because l need to talk
about something.
otherwise, l'm actually probably
going to shit my pants in this stairwell.
l'm sorry.
hey, wait, wait. you guys hear that?
you guys hear that?
— yes.
— yeah.
yeah, l think we're getting close.
hud, l'm gonna check this floor.

oh, god.
l don't think there's anybody here. no.
— oh, jesus.

— l don't know. l'm sorry.
— lily, lily, it's a straight shot.
look, it's a straight shot.

the air conditioners. okay?
