the morning it all began,
began like any other morning.
oh! oh, bernie.
dad, i need lunch money
and a note for gym.
and you promised to help me
with my book report, remember?
the author devotes a lot of time
to developing the characters,
and he seduces the reader by...
- seduces?
- yeah. he, uh, draws you in, you know?
- you wanna know how it ends.
- but i already knew how it ended.
ok, so write it was predictable.
- no, dad, i mean i've seen the movie.
- oh. right.
come on. you got to eat.
can't you think of another word?
"intrigues."
"intrigues." thanks, mom.
you're smarter than dad, you know that?
yes, god help us if he finds out.
if mom's so smart, maybe she
should help you with your book report.
see what i mean?
- i have a meeting, dee.
- yeah, i have meetings too.
amy, your book report, your call.
me or him?
i choose option c
where you two get me a tutor.

positive.
amy, your bus'll be here soon.
bye.
bernie, you stay here.
you used to kiss each other
goodbye in the mornings.
shut up.
come on.
the author intrigues the reader
by twisting the narrative
so you never know what's coming next.
how's that?
it's all right.
the train on platform two
is the 7:50 red line service
to chicago central.
calling at central street, davis street,
main street, rogers park,
ravenswood, clybourn
and chicago central.

- nine dollars.
- oh, gee. this is embarrassing.
- and it's only monday.
my wife, she, uh, emptied my wallet
when she left for work this morning.
oh, so it's the wife's fault, is it?
- yeah. i'm trying to explain.
- it's nine dollars.
pay up or get off at the next stop.
it's that simple.
- i'll pay for him.
- what?
no, no. you don't have to do that.
don't worry about it.
one lucky guy.
no, really. it's my fault.
it's all right. i paid, didn't i?
here you go. thank you very much.
thank you.
just so you know,
it wasrt an act or anything.

- ok. i don't.
i mean, there's an atm
at union if you're getting off there.
tomorrow is fine.
of course, there is a ten percent
interest charge overnight.

jmd/march. it's a midsize place.
we've got some
semi-decent accounts. you?
avery price. it's a big place.
we don't do semi-decent accounts.
- this your usual train?
- why?
- so i'll know how to pay you back.
- nine dollars. i think i'll survive.
no, i gotta give it back.
i'd feel ethically impugned if i didn't.
impugned?
well, i wouldn't want you
to feel impugned.
so... if you take the same train
tomorrow, i'll pay you back.
it's a date.
morning.

to raise our commission, eh?
we have some issues.
we feel like no matter
how much we talk to you,
we just don't get heard by you people.
this last commercial
is a case in point.
we agreed on a strategy.
we signed off on it.
then what happened?
you went off
in all these other directions.
the cut you sent us, it's nothing
like how we said it should be.
look, susan, the directions
i took were, you know...
i've been doing this for ten years, ok?
i'm sorry.
i'll do it however it is
you want it done.
the time for apologies is over.
what we need now is change.
you don't want me on the account?
uh, susan appreciates all you've done.
you have different visions.
you might have backed me up in there.
backed you up!
susan davis is a $130 million client.
- she's a bitch.
- she's the worst kind of bitch.
she has a point. you're in a rut,
my friend, and you know it.
forget susan davis.
get a new account, get back
on your feet, back to what you do best.
goddamn it.
talk to me, tell me what's going on,
maybe i can help.

i live here. amy, please!
bernie, cut it out.
- you're late.
- sorry.
how was work?
work was...
...fine. you?

to monitor me this week?
- ethan jeffries.

he always throws a fit
when i stray from the lesson plan.
there's a lot of that going around.
so, what did i do?
handed out an english composition
in the math hour today.

the title for the composition
was "why we like principal jeffries."

- rabbinically.

my mom was catholic.
i got all kinds of guilt.
oh. how's that working out for you?
fine. i had a lot of therapy
when i was a kid.
- you're kinda funny, aren't you?
- you're an easy crowd.
- what's your name?
- lucinda.
lucinda harris.
so we came here when i was little,
just me and my mom.
- we were only gonna stay a year.
- mm-hm.
- how about you?
- oh, all over.
i was an army brat.
i grew up everywhere and nowhere.
my address changed every six months,
and so did my best friend.
but, then again, i got to change too.
if i screwed up in fort hood, texas,
they didn't have to know about it
in saratoga, new york.
i could just be this whole other person.
that happen a lot? you screwing up?
mm-hm. yep.
i was the consummate rebel
against authority.
- oh, is that what you called it?
- no, that's what my parents called it.
i called it getting lit.
but then i got my act together
when i got out of school,
and dad really wanted a lawyer.
he settled for a banker.
the next stop
is chicago union station.
this is the end of the red line.
all passengers,
please disembark at this time.
thank you.
busy day?
oh, in finance, every day is a busy day.
oh, i bet you're getting a lot of angry
calls with an economy like this.
well, if you consider
death threats angry.
tell me about it.
clients, they love you
when times are good...
no, no, no, when times are good,
you never make them enough money.
there's always some cousin
or brother or grandmother
whose stock split 64 ways,
and why can't you sell 'em one of those,
like i got some
crystal ball or something.
tell me about it.
i got fired off my biggest account.
my boss didn't even warn me.
supposed to be a good friend of mine.
that bastard.
do you want me to yell at him for you?
give me his number,
i'll crank-call him.
some people just don't know how
to appreciate what they've got.
morning, charles.
yes, sir.
- what up, chaz?
- hey.
you all right?
you look a little sick in the face,
- like you got the bug.
- no.
- it ain't contagious, is it?
- it's nothing.
- that's what dick lembergh said.
- who's dick lembergh?
ain't nobody now.
that motherfucker dead.
winston.
come here. let me ask you something.
- this about the computers?
- no, no.
i appreciate what you did for me.
forget about it. buy me a beer sometime.
this is something else.
go ahead. shoot for it.
say you went to the movies,
but you forgot your money,
and someone offered
to buy your ticket for you.
- in chicago?
- i'm just saying, hypothetically.
it's only right
to talk to them, isn't it?
i mean, thank them.
show you appreciate it somehow, right?
this full price or matinee?
that's the difference
between five or ten bucks, man.
you know what?
never mind.
hey, yo. i asked that cop
about those questions,
and three other players
were national league.
i'm still working on that.
i need those answers
by tomorrow to get that moola, baby.
- we're cool about the computers, right?
- yes, winston. we're cool.
chaz.
we're cool about the computers, right?
avery price.
- lucinda.
- you mean lucinda harris?
yeah. could you tell her
it's charles schine?
i'll put you through to her office.
- charles.
- hey.
we have this beautiful house
in lake forest,
just the kind of house
i dreamed about as a kid.
what's your husband do?
- he golfs.
- for a living?
he wishes.
no, he's a broker. we met at stanford.
he's up at 3am so he can be
in the offices when london opens.
we also have an apartment in the city.
he stays there during the week
to avoid the commute,
and of course,
the weekends are for golf.
so when do you see each other?
the usuals.
birthdays, christmases.
we communicate mainly via hallmark.
but hey, i have a beautiful,
wonderful baby girl, so there.
deanna!
amy. amy!
can you hear me?
can you hear me, sweetheart?
breathe. breathe, amy.
breathe. there you go.
daddy's here. it's ok.
everything's ok. daddy's here.
there you go.
there you go, sweetheart.
stay with me.
there you go. there you go.
it's ok, sweetheart. it's ok.
shh.
amy. there you go.
- it's all right, baby.
- there you go.
- diabetes?
- type 1. worst kind.
we took out
a second mortgage on the house
to get her one of those
mobile dialysis machines
so she doesn't have to go
to the hospital every day.
can't they, um...?
can't they give her a new kidney?
they have. three times.
her body keeps rejecting them.
there's this new anti-rejection drug
coming out, supposed to be amazing.
has to be approved,
but they say it's got a 99 percent rate
- of success in the tests so far.
- expensive?
like you wouldn't believe.
and, of course,
insurance won't cover it.
sure. probably cheaper
to let her suffer, right?
we're ok.
we've been saving for years.
so now we just sit around
and wait for the call.
hi. amy, don't let bernie out.
hey. you home?
yeah, just now. what's wrong?
i just got out of eliot's office.
he slammed me
with some big new account.
i'm gonna be home late,
so, uh, don't wait up.
all right. how come you're
calling from your cell phone?
amy, your bag's in the back.
i don't know.
i'm just down the hall and wanted
to let you know as soon as possible.
thanks.
i'm sorry.
it's been kind of hectic lately.
um, i gotta go.

it's not really gambling
when you never lose.

- really?
i'll bet you $20
that i can kiss you
without ever touching your lips.
- kiss me?
- without touching.
how?

i sold a pure commodity
at a fair market price.
no. prison.
prisors like walkir a tightrope.
you try not to get involved.
actir like you're blind 24 hours a day.
this shit takes
a shitload of concentration.
i mean, when i first got in thatjoint,
man, i was prime meat.
i was what they call unaffiliated.
so, what'd you do?
i got affiliated.
i had to stick a shank up in some kid.
what, you killed him?
your back is up against the wall,
and it's you or him,
you gotta do what you gotta do.
yeah. this is charles.
you ever get
a little sidetracked, charlie?
i need another loan, charlie.
now listen. listen to me.
i've got no more money for you.
ok. ok, man. you win.
you want me
to leave you alone,
i'll leave you alone.
no problemo.
for $100,000, though.
fuck you.
tsk. you ain't that smart.
anybody ever told you that?
how'd you get this number?
that's it. keep thinking like that.
how did i get your cell number?
it isn't listed, is it?
you called my wife.
ah, no. guess again.
ok, i'll give you a clue.
on this phone,
it's speed dial number eight.
hospital one, doctor two.
you're number eight. [laughs]
you don't even rate in the top five.
how does that feel, charlie?
oh, jesus!
oh, yeah.
hey! here's my man.
you ok? you look
like you ran a marathon.
what?
what did you say
to him on the phone?
well, in our business one has to know
how to light a fire under people.
it's the best way to get things done.
do you not agree, charles?
- what's going on here?
- mr. laroche needs you
to sign off on that thing
he called about.
oh, gosh.
- did you think i would not come?
- no, i thought you got the message.
i'm sorry. i'm confused.
but you look so out of shape, charles.
sit down and catch
your breath for a second.
- i'll pour coffee.
- you don't know how many times
- i told him to join my tennis club.
- what?
you know charles. he prefers
to follow sports, not play them.
but one has
to keep fit in today's world
'cause you never know when you'll
need to be at your fighting best.
please.
he's right. you might have
been able to outrun that mugger.
oh. well, from what charles told me,
that thug had a jump on him
from the very start.
this is crazy.
you never had a chance, did you?
i'm gonna get him back.
you're not getting anyone back.
you have a family.
you're so right, deanna, so right.
you wanna protect your family
'cause at the end of the day,
this is the most important thing
in the whole world.
- mom, have you seen my sketchbook?
- get back upstairs.
- go do your homework.
- charles.
amy, this is mr. laroche.
he works with your father.
come here, beauty.
it means, "like a little stone
that's rolling down the river."
so cute.
- may i kiss you?
- mm-hm.
you know,
we were looking at your drawings.
they're lovely. truly beautiful.
thank you.
such a talent.
you know, when i first came
to this beautiful country,
i spent quite a lot
of time in new york.
and if you allow me, of course,
i could show these
to some very prominent art dealers.
that sounds great.
how about we go sign off
on this contract?
oh, yes, business is business,
of course.
- bye-bye.
- bye.
whoop!
she's so cute.
i'll be up soon, honey.
how old is she?
- you get the fuck out of my house.
- what did you say?
- get out.
- i beg your pardon.
what'd you say?
ooh.
you don't like that, huh?
you upper-crust motherfucker. huh?
you got it all, and yet you're ready
to fuck it up forjust a bit of pussy?
- fuck...
- shh, shh, shh, shh.
a hundred...
a hundred thousand dollars,
and i just might
give you back your balls, bitch.
you hear me?
say it. ok? ok?
yeah, nice boy.
ok... ok.
well... au revoir. thanks for having me.
- au revoir.
- i'll see you soon. bye.
he seems like a lovely guy.
why didn't you call me
when this whole thing began?
why didn't you call me
when this whole thing began?
i'm supposed
to be your first call, charles.
i don't need a lecture,
i need to know my options.
look, she's gotta come forward.
i told you, she can't do that.
- we need a statement on the record.
- jerry, he was in my house.
with my family.
he didn't break in.
he didn't touch them.
- he didn't threaten them.
- jerry. he broke my nose.
ok, show me the police report.
did you go to the police
when you got beat?
so...
so you've done nothing
about this for six weeks,
and now suddenly you want me
to file a complaint?
you've got to get her to come forward.
anything else is just...
pissing in the wind.
- what are you doing here?
- i spoke to my lawyer.
- we have to go to the police.
- we can't go to the police.
listen to me.
- we didn't sleep together.
- it's the same thing.
because we didn't fuck
doesn't mean we didn't cross the line.
we went to the hotel.
we started to do it.
and we didn't stop
out of the conscience of our hearts.
exactly. we were attacked.
i had an abortion, charles.
what?
why didn't you tell me?
i... i could have helped.
i could have done something.
done what, charles?
what could you have done?
oh! snap his back, man!
smack him!
referee, that's a penalty!
sorry, you know i get zoned
to this hockey shit, chaz, man.
ok, i'm listening.
so, what do you think i should do?
shit, i don't know, man.
but you see how it works, though, right?
he lures you in with 20 grand. folks
like you could pull together 20 grand
if you had to, right?
you think, 20 grand,
bong, and he's gone, right?
nah. it's not about that.
he wanna see if you're
the kind of asshole who pays.
then after that...
...slap the big dick on you, hit you
for the real cheese, the big bucks.
that's what this game
is all about, chaz.
thanks, winston,
i feel much better now.
you're a wild cowboy, yo.
well, can you pay him?
technically, yeah, i have the money.
shit, yo, so pay him,
man, be done with this.
i can't. it's put away
for something else.
it's years of savings. can't touch it.
i don't know what to do.
i'm going out of my fuckir mind here.
- it's there everywhere i turn.
- calm down, chaz.
look, man, drink your beer.
shit, that ain't even
strong enough right now.
o'malley, let us get
a double scotch and hold the rocks.
let me tell you something.
i spent five years in the joint
with motherfuckers like this.
the first thing you must understand
about a rapist is that they pussies.
they weak. they prey on the weak.
so, what do you think i should do?
listen, man, i like you,
'cause you're different
than the rest of them.
i don't like to see you
in no position like this.
so i'm gonna do you a solid.
i'm gonna scare this pussy
off your back for you.
- no. no, no, no.
- listen, i owe you.
you caught me stealir those computers,
you coulda dropped a dime on me,
i'd have been locked up
for three more years.
- winston, you owe me nothing.
- look at it this way then.
let's make it a business proposition.
instead of you giving
this motherfucker 100k,
you could pay me, say, ten percent?
yeah, $10,000 in cash,
and i'll scare that pepé le pew
motherfucker all the way back to france.
hurry up.
- thank you!
- happy birthday.
look at this one.

i'm sure.
you know, ever since he was a kid,
winston never could
seem to catch a break.

it's the only way out of this.
what happens

my wallet's on the table. take it.
i don't want your money. they do.
they want it all. you're in a scam.
- what?
- a con.
these two were gonna take you
for everything you've got.
i don't know what you're talking about.
who are you, and what do you want?
you met on the train, did you?
by accident. just happened somehow.
and she was fuckir sweet...
...and smart...
...and you couldn't believe
how attracted she was to you.
she was just too good to be true.
she showed you this picture
of her daughter.
everything this bitch
told you was a lie.
not everything was a lie, charles.
he was just about to rob you,
and then rape her.
only it wouldn't have been rape,
would it?
i don't understand.
why would he rape her?
because it makes you feel guilty
you didn't stop it...
...that you didn't protect her.
later on, she may even be as sick
as to tell you she had an abortion.
- so you don't go to the police.
- i don't want any part of this.
- there's a man waiting.
- i have to leave...
no!
boy, you're getting better, charles.
i'm kind of proud of you.
i want... my fucking money back!
i want everything you took from me.
well...
i don't think that's
gonna be possible, charlie.
just give him his money, and let's go.
he's a fuckir mark, for chrissake.
that sweetie pie is worried
about that little girl of yours.
- oh, stop it!
- she didn't look that sick to me.
just stop it!
let me outta here!
i'm gonna get outta here now!
i'm telling you,
move away from the fucking door!
i'm gonna shoot!
get outta my way! i'm leaving
ah!

what the hell is this?
all the years i've known you,
i never figured you
for a thief, charles.
you want to tell me
about the $10,000 for the aspirin spot?
it was an emergency.
i was gonna pay it back.
pay it back?
what am i, a bank?
and now you're stealing from it.
if i were to write a bill for what you
owe me, what should i make it for?
it was just the once, i swear.
well, barry'll be the judge of that.
so...
...tell me what was so important
that you had to do this.
can't.
i can't tell you.
i want to, but i can't. i'm sorry.
fine. you wanna play it that way,
i'll start proceedings.

that's good.
i hate it when people
don't remember your name.

- it's charles, by the way.
- right. charles.
- did i ask you what you're in for yet?
- embezzlement.
that's not a bad deal.
six months teaching cons
for ripping off your boss.
you're puerto rican, right?
what the fuck is that?
puerto rico, how do you spell it?
ok, guys.
guys!
there's a quiz on your desks.
it'll probably take you as long as it
takes me to read your homework, so...
let's go.
how do you spell that?
"the morning it all began,
began like any other morning.
charles was running late,
and as a result,
he missed his regular train.
championship fucking.
twelve rounder.
i need a loan, charlie.
charles had made him kill.
charles was to blame.
he was a murder suspect.
lucinda turned out to be
this whole other person.
charles wiped his prints
and ran away like he was never there,
back to his shitty little life.
but when he finished reading the story,
he went to the laundry room."
- yeah?
- i need to use the bathroom.
i'll alert the media.
you looking for a daddy?
what the fuck
you looking at, homey?
oooh...
i hope you liked my story.
you never checked if i made it out
of that hotel alive, did you?
you're so
predictable, charles.
it takes more
than one bullet to kill me.
much more.
but you took something from me, charlie,
and that ain't right.
it's my money.
fuck the money.
- you killed her.
- you're insane.
i loved her, charlie...
...when you just wanted to fuck her.
what do you want?
i want you, charlie.
i'm gonna fuck
with your life because i can.
by the way...
...is your daughter still a virgin?
you don't know how happy i was
to see your name on those notebooks.
it's like if you begged me to find you.
man, you ended up
in the wrong prison, charlie.
- laroche.
- yeah?
i chose this prison.
oh!
ok, mr. schine. you're free to go.
you take it easy now.
i met him
a few times a while ago.
here he comes.
all right, thank you.
- what did you tell them?
- the truth.
i went to use the bathroom,
and this guy jumped me with a shank.
well, that guy
was the asshole who killed winston.
he killed two people in paris,
one in new york.
you expect me to believe
that you overpowered him?
i guess i got lucky.
you brought that shank in with you,
it's premeditated murder.
law don't care who you kill.
i guess the law didn't care much
for winston, either.
bye. see you guys later.
ok, sweetheart.
