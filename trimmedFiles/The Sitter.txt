<i>come inside, take off your coat</i>
<i>i'll make you feel at home</i>
(girl breathing heavily)
<i>now let's pour a glass of wine</i>
<i>'cause now we're all alone</i>
(girl continues moaning)
oh, my god!
<i>girl you make me feel real good</i>
that's right.
what's up?
oh, my god.
my mom was so right.
nice guys really do
eat the best pussy.
i'm not really sure how to
interpret that. thank you?
(laughs) oh, my god.
how are you so good at that?
i'll let you in
on a trade secret.
i actually write a short story
with my tongue every time i do it.
it follows this young kid
who finds this
alien in the woods
with all these
reese's pieces and stuff.
and he learns that
aliens are just no different.
you just can
connect with anyone.
it's kind of like e.
t., only with a lot more going down on chicks.
cool beans.
yeah, cool beans.
definitely. cool little
frozen beans.
yeah.
all right, so...
thank you for coming.
thank you.
yeah, we should, uh...
we should probably...
yeah, you should probably go.
switch places.
what's that?
(laughs)
i figured...
don't you have to go?
no, no, i just figured because
i made "mouth love" to you
that maybe you could return the favor.
(clicks tongue)
what?
maybe toss a bj my way.
if you have time.
um, my stomach is
super-iffy right now.
i think i got food poisoning.
baby.
so i'm just in no condition
to blow you right now, noah.
no, yeah, that's cool.
okay.
sorry. next time, sweetie.
are you sure you don't
want to come over tonight?
there's this thing called
a geomagnetic storm.
it's really cool
and rare, actually.
it's like
an astronomical explosion
in the sky of all
these beautiful colors.
whoa! (laughs)
kind of like
mother nature's fireworks.
it happens, like, almost never.
like i said,
i'm just not feeling good.
but thank you so much
for going down on me.
oh, yeah. you're really good
at, um, getting going down on,
getting downed on,
so you should be proud
of that as well.
okay, cool. you da man!
you da man.
peace. you're
the best, sweetie.
don't stop believing in
yourself, okay, maris?
<i>uncle ricky, could you
read us a bedtime story?</i>
<i>please, huh, please?</i>
<i>here we go</i>
<i>once upon a time, not long ago</i>
<i>where people wore pajamas
and lived life slow</i>
<i>where laws were stern
and justice stood</i>
<i>and people were behavin'
like they ought to good</i>
<i>there lived a little boy
who was misled</i>
<i>by another little boy
and this is what he said</i>
<i>me and you tike,
we're gonna make some cash</i>
<i>robbin' old folks
and makin' the dash</i>
<i>they did the job,
money came with ease</i>
<i>but one couldn't stop,
it's like he had a disease</i>
<i>he robbed another and another
and a sister and a brother</i>
<i>tried to rob a man
who was a d. t. undercover</i>
<i>the cop grabbed his arm,
he started actin' erratic</i>
<i>he said, "keep still boy,
no need for static"</i>
<i>punched him in his belly
and gave him a slap</i>
<i>but little did he know,
the little boy was strapped</i>
<i>the kid pulled outta gun,
he said, "why'd you hit me?"</i>
<i>the barrel was set straight
for the cop's kidney</i>
<i>ran up the stairs
up to the top floor</i>
<i>opened up a door,
there guess who he saw</i>
<i>dave, the dope fiend
shootin' dope</i>
<i>who don't know the meaning
of water nor soap?</i>
<i>he said, "i need bullets,
hurry up, run "</i>
<i>the dope fiend rolled back
a spankin' shot gun</i>
<i>this ain't funny,
so don't ya dare laugh</i>
<i>just another case
about the wrong path</i>
<i>straight and narrow
or your soul gets cast</i>
<i>good night</i>
yo, mom, what's up?
noah!
where were you?
were you out with that girl again?
yeah, but she's not
"that girl," okay?
we're in a relationship.
it's legit.
so have you started
looking for a job yet?
i can't afford to have you
sitting around all day.
you're in a period of stasis.
just a stage of stasis.
sorry.
<i>you sure you don't
want that beer now?</i>
<i>or maybe something stronger?
i have absinthe.</i>
why can't we hit up dad?
he owes us 10 years of alimony.
oh, look, kiddo.
if you're looking for a handout,
think again times 10.
that guy's a diamond dealer.
he has crazy cash.
why'd you marry
such an a-hole?
that a-hole gave me the
greatest gift in the world.
crabs?
he gave me you.
okay.
(laughs)
so, tell me, what do you think?
do i look okay?
you look amazing.
why are you so
concerned with your outfit?
mrs. pedulla is introducing
me to a surgeon
at the fundraiser at
the historical society.
okay.
she thinks we're going
to hit it off. nice.
well, don't give
it up too easily.
give what up?
what?
give what up?
what did...
what the hell are
you talking about?
i don't know.
have fun. i love you. okay?
i love you.
(kissing)
hey, mom.
yeah.
i think you're going to
have a really great night,
and you look beautiful.
oh. from your lips
to god's ears.
<i>scientists are predicting a giant
storm over the city tonight.</i>
<i>a geomagnetic storm, that is.</i>
<i>caused by ﬂare-ups on the
sun,</i> (phone ringing)
<i>this rare storm affects
the earth's magnetic field...</i>
noah, can you get the phone?
mom, the phone's ringing!
noah, please get the phone!
mom, the phone's ringing!
do you hear it?
noah, can't you think about somebody
else besides yourself for once?
no, i totally was.
that's why i said the phone was ringing.
i was letting you
know that it was ringing.
yeah. i'm thrilled
about tonight.
<i>you flip, but they flop.
you flip, but they flop!</i>
what? oh, is that right?
noah: they perfected
the pancake?
a rain check?
it's a perfect pancake!
no, that's fine.
it's perfect.
mom, tell whoever's
on the phone
that there's a perfect pancake.
thanks.
i'm not going after all.
what? why?
the pedullas' sitter
canceled at the last minute.
what?
do i have shit on my face?
come on. don't tell me
you can't use the money.
are you crazy?
no. i'm not mary poppins.
i'm not gonna be a babysitter.
i'm an adult man.
okay'? babysitting sucks.
adult men don't babysit things.
oh, noah, you're
wonderful with children!
you know, never mind.
who am i kidding?
finding a guy at my age is ridiculous.
i'm going to change
my dress. (exhales)
what are you in
the mood for? chinese?
(sighs) oh, come on.
(rings doorbell)
noah: ding-dong!
noah!
mrs. pedulla.
it's so good to see you!
oh, my gosh.
get over... bring it in for a hug, babe.
what are we doing?
god, i haven't see you since
you were, like, 15.
yeah. so dr. pedulla, he's still alive?
you two are still together?
um...
oh! that's my kind
of tv, right there.
yeah, well, feel free to
watch anything you want.
cool.
yeah.
hey, slater?
anyway, honey, this is noah.
he's going to be babysitting tonight.
what happened to nancy?
honey, we talked about this.
nancy has a urinary
tract infection, okay?
is clayton coming over tonight?
no, mom. his tarantula
died from parasites,
and now he's in mourning.
well, you're in luck, noah.
the two of them
together are just trouble.
hey. that's not true.
why do you say that?
you're always attacking us!
honey, lam not attacking you.
okay? calm down.
(phone ringing)
you know what?
i'll be right back. yeah.
okay? excuse me
just one second.
hello?
noah: hey, what are
you watching?
just watching some gymnastics.
cool.
hey, how old are you, man?
thirteen.
thirteen?
what am i doing here?
why aren't you babysitting yourself?
i'm not a babysitter, okay?
yeah, neither am i.
if you would just
man up and babysit,
i wouldn't have to be here tonight.
i could be out having fun.
i have severe anxiety issues.
and my doctor,
he says that i can't
handle any kind
of responsibility,
or else i could just snap
(snaps fingers)
at any moment.
jesus christ, man. relax.
okay. sorry.
slater, nice to meet you.
all right, should we go upstairs?
bye, honey.
noah: we're gonna have
some fun tonight, pal.
(singing)
<i>roll back nice and easy</i>
<i>keep your breath inside
so you don't get wheezy</i>
honey! what did mommy tell you
about the mascara? put it down.
you said i
could play dress-up.
yeah, i said you
could play dress-up,
not make yourself
look like a hooker.
look at you!
(laughs) my daughter
blithe is going through
this whole "celebutante" phase.
it's kind of unfortunate,
but it's a fad.
that's what they
do in the schools.
it'll <i>pass.</i> i don't know
where they come from.
kids, right?
yeah, kids.
are you the babysitter?
why, in fact, i am.
i'm noah.
noah. that's your name?
yeah.
that's a super-hot name.
what?
honey, it's not hot.
it's just his name.
mom, trust me.
it's a hot name.
it's actually biblical.
the bible's a hot book.
sometimes i like
to get dressed up
and wear my mom's makeup, noah.
that's cool.
i was thinking
we could dress you up
like a princess.
no, i don't think,
uh... (laughs)
no, honey.
maybe not tonight.
slater: mom!
excuse me just one second.
yeah, see you in a sec.
hey, noah. i have
a little surprise for you.
cool. thanks. what is it?
do you like to smell pretty?
do i like to what? (yells)
(coughing) oh, my god!
you got it right in my mouth!
why'd you do that?
(blithe giggling)
you just spit on my carpet!
and you just sprayed perfume
in my mouth!
what's your problem?
my real babysitter, nancy, she
plays with me when she babysits.
she does what i want her
to do, princess noah!
you know what?
(whispering) i'm gonna let
you in on a little secret.
i'm not a real babysitter.
(fake gasps)
(whispering) shocking.
i'm more of a sit-on-the-couch,
eat-a-burrito,
do-whatever-l say-or-i'll-kill-you
type of babysitter.
that's my style, blood.
you understand?
well, i want to
wear sparkly things,
shiny things,
and glittery stuff
to my favorite
hot nightclub, okay?
(mimicking)
motherfuck!
you guys okay in here?
what's up? yeah, no, yeah,
i'm just hanging with this
little angel right here.
yeah, we're just chillin'.
(quietly) that's funny.
your breath is really flowery.
oh, thank you.
thank you so much.
yeah.
okay, should we go downstairs?
yeah, cool.
announcer: <i>tonight's main
event features crowd favorite</i>
<i>ricky fontaine
versus dustin macmillan.</i>
mrs. pedulla: rodrigo!
what did i tell you about
fireworks in the house?
and can you shut off the
kickboxing for one night, please?
say, um, hola to noah.
(hissing)
we just adopted him
from el salvador last year
and, you know, he's going
through some transitions.
noah: okay, cool.
mrs. pedulla: okay, well,
we'll see you later, all right?
<i>besos.</i>
sweet kid.
yeah.
he's a cutie pie.
(ominous cowboy
music playing)
you kind of have to
watch out for rodrigo.
he has a habit of running away.
here, hold on to this.
we sewed a gps chip into his jacket
so we could keep track of him.
it's kind of like
a lojack for kids.
cool. it's just like
a little dot
that follows him,
like a fugitive.
hey, honey, we're running late!
let's go!
so...
dr. pedulla: in a minute.
all of our information is
in here, under the blue tab.
there's some frozen pizzas
and pudding in the fridge,
and we'll be at the historical
society if you need us.
cool.
someone smells wonderful!
i believe that's noah's mouth.
you remember noah.
i understand you
were cited recently
for driving
under the influence.
needless to say, our cars
are off-limits to you.
okay, no cars. got it.
we'll be back
no later than 1:00.
earlier's good for me,
too, so hurry home.
and thank you!
thank you, sweetheart.
what the fuck am i doing here?
<i>i come in peace.</i>
<i>and you go in pieces, asshole.</i>
what's up, little man?
(ominous cowboy
music playing)
what'd you do that for?
you clean it.
you clean it.
fucking weirdo.
blithe: hey, noah!
how's that perfume taste?
rodrigo, what is
your deal? stop!
can we go to a club tonight?
this place is so dead.
no.
don't you just want to
go dancing or something?
rodrigo, seriously,
what is your deal? stop!
i'm trying to watch tv with
jonbenet ramsey over here.
(blowing raspberry)
that's uncomfortable.
do you want to
hear some gossip?
i got some hot gossip.
i'm okay, actually.
i'm trying to watch this, if
you (shushing) could be quiet.
give it.
i'm watching this, so can you
guys just be quiet, please?
thank you.
(whispering) i know
a secret nobody else knows.
(doorbell ringing)
oh, what's up, twins?
ls slater home?
is he here?
yeah, oh, my god!
slater!
you got the two redrum chicks from
<i>the shining</i> here to see you!
slater's a cool guy.
twin 2: we go to
school together.
oh, my god!
take care.
hi, slater!
wendy sapperstein is having
her bat mitzvah tonight,
and she said it was okay if
some boys wanted to crash it.
but we only want
the super-cute boys.
i don't know if
i could make it tonight.
my parents aren't home,
and i'm not really
supposed to go anywhere.
well, if you want to come,
you can text us.
yeah, text us, definitely.
okay.
i'll see you later, guys.
twin 1: okay, cool!
(phone ringing)
what's cooking,
good-looking?
you know what?
i'm at a party.
party? i thought you
had food poisoning.
<i>i did, and then
steph called me,</i>
<i>and she invited
me to this party.</i>
<i>do you want to come?</i>
damn!
i'm doing something
for my mom right now.
i really,
really want to see you.
<i>i'm actually, like,
super-horny for you,</i>
and i was thinking
we could have sex.
like intercourse sex?
yeah, like full-on
vaginal sex.
(noah clearing throat)
yeah, i think i can work something out.
yeah. for sure.
<i>awesome.</i>
listen, will you do me a favor and
pick up some coke on your way?
yeah, sure. do you want anything
else, like beer, mixers?
(laughs) <i>no, i mean, like</i>
(in sing-song) coke!
<i>you mean blow?</i>
i thought you were done with that stuff.
that stuff's bad news.
i am done with it.
it's not for me. it's for steph,
and it's her birthday.
she asked me for it.
i'm just trying to be a
really good friend about it.
i don't even know where i'd
get something like that.
<i>just call karl.</i>
<i>who's karl?</i>
he's just a super-awesome guy
who sells me drugs.
used to sell me drugs.
(exhaling) noah...
i only have 150 bucks.
<i>that's more than enough.</i>
<i>just ask for one ticket,
and he'll hook it up.</i>
<i>leave me alone, asshole!
i'm on the phone with my boyfriend.</i>
<i>did you just call me
your boyfriend?</i>
<i>yeah, i guess i did.
so are you coming or not?</i>
<i>hello? are you there?</i>
yeah. fuck it. i'm in.
holy shit balls.
a minivan.
that car's not hot at all.
noah: as much as
i hate to do this,
we're going on
a little field trip.
(kids shouting)
(kids continue shouting)
what is your deal?
why are you wearing so much makeup?
(singing) <i>looking real fly
on my way to the club</i>
<i>gonna dance all night
and get fucked up</i>
blithe: say whatever you want.
i know i look good.
all right, one of you guys
has to hop up here with me.
i'm not your chauffeur.
what if you hit
somebody or something?
i mean, it's safer for children
to be in the back seat.
you are such a bitch.
grow a set of nuts.
i beat him for you.
get his ass.
guys.
not again.
stop being such children.
hit him in the face, dawg!
go away.
stop it.
one thing about rodrigo.
he's not a bitch,
i'll tell you that much.
(rap music playing)
(laughing) slater, seriously,
tell me you are not
wearing a fanny pack.
tell me i'm imagining that and
that's not what i'm actually seeing.
i need it to carry my pills.
why do you take
those pills anyway?
i already told you,
i have issues.
issues?
you look like a gap model!
when i was your age,
i had a mouth full of braces
and a face like
a papa john's pizza.
those are real issues, my man.
whatever.
blithe: i've got a good idea.
why don't we go to a dance club?
why don't we play a game?
like spin the bottle?
no, not like spin the bottle,
like a little game i invented
called the shut-the-fuck-up game.
first person not to shut the
fuck up loses. ready? go.
(farting)
(groans) come on, rodrigo,
you just lost, buddy.
it was not me.
(giggling)
noah: slater,
that's disgusting.
didn't your parents teach
you not to fart in the car?
you just crop-dusted me.
no, that was not me.
uh-oh.
what's "uh-oh"?
it was me. i pooted.
i don't think it
was just a poot-poot.
i sharted.
(all exclaiming in disgust)
noah: come on!
(singing) <i>when you're shopping
it's super-cool</i>
hey, noah. oh, my god,
isn't this shirt so cute?
oh, it's super-cute!
can you get it for me?
yeah! of course.
i'll get you anything you want
seriously?
no.
here, put these on.
they're green.
i wouldn't be caught dead in these.
don't shit your
pants next time.
dressing room's over there.
clean up, or whatever.
can i help you, sir?
huh?
can i help you?
i'm just waiting for somebody.
(laughs) yeah.
yup!
(fake laughing)
no. i'm just waiting
for somebody.
that's pretty weird, considering
you're a grown-ass man
hanging out in the little
girls' underwear section.
right. i could see
how that could be
misconstrued as strange,
or whatever.
very.
they fit. let's go.
there we go. there she is.
excuse me, young lady,
do you know this person?
no.
yeah.
which is it?
he came into my house
and stole my mom's minivan.
now he's taking me and my
brothers to get some candy.
okay, that sounds way, way
worse than it actually is.
hey, don't i know
you from somewhere?
what? no,
i'm the babysitter.
what?
he's not a real babysitter.
he's a "do-whatever-i-say-
or-i'll-kill-you type of babysitter."
what?
that sounds way...
that's what he said!
blithe, shut the fuck up.
do not tell her to shut up!
thank you.
ooh, shit! i remember you!
i went to high school with your ass!
you came to my
house party one time,
got all wasted, and then you
puked in my grandmama's urn.
and when i asked
you about it, you lied
and ran away like
a little biotch!
i didn't run away
like a little biotch!
i probably just ran
like a normal person.
and now you're hanging out in the
little girls' clothes section.
can you please
lower your voice?
there are numerous
misunderstandings.
no, no, no. i'm not buying none of this.
come on, little girl.
let me go!
i'm not buying it!
(clamoring)
you got some shit to deal with!
security!
why did you say that, blithe?
you were trying to make
me buy green underwear.
green underwear is not hot!
you're the worst
babysitter ever!
(mimicking blithe) "you're
the worst babysitter ever!"
(blows raspberry)
you guys?
where's rodrigo?
i don't know.
i guess he left.
(tires squealing)
that's an incredible observation, slater.
where did he go?
i don't know.
i was talking to my friend clayton.
which way did he go?
i don't know!
(gps tracker beeping)
got you, you little bastard.
hey, what's up?
may i help you, sir?
yeah.
i'm looking for
a small hispanic boy.
about 4'8", leather jacket,
pajamas, cowboy boots.
have you seen him?
no.
"i've not seen
a 4'8" hispanic boy
in a leatherjacket, pajamas,
and cowboy boots.
probably would
have remembered that.
something tells me you have
before, you fucking asshole.
(singing) <i>don't say no
because i insist</i>
<i>somewhere, somehow
someone's got to be kissed</i>
(toilet flushing)
there you are!
what are you doing in here?
i dropped a bomb.
(ominous cowboy music playing)
that's very cute.
come on, wash your hands.
(laughing)
what's so funny?
oh, shit!
oh, shit, what are you doing?
(noah stammering)
(people talking indistinctly)
man: what is
going on back there?
it's all good! just continue
eating your meals. i know him.
he's a friend of mine.
that looks good.
what is that?
you run away again,
and i'll break your legs!
then i bite your ear!
what? i bite your what?
i eat your ear.
i bite it off with my teeth,
then you don't hear nothing.
that's very specific.
(sighing) all right. i've got to pick
up some candy for my girlfriend.
so you guys wait here and watch
little bin laden
back there, okay?
this isn't about
getting candy, is it?
lock the doors, keep your
head between your legs.
don't move or talk to
anybody or look at anybody.
(speaking spanish)
(softly) don't you
fuck with me, rodrigo.
woman: hey, mister!
hey, over here!
i do top shit or bottom,
whatever you want.
noah griffith?
yeah.
are you karl?
(garv giggles and snorts)
no, i fucking wish, <i>papi.</i>
if you want to see karl,
i'm gonna have to, like,
strip-search you.
okay, we're good.
i believed you.
follow me!
what the fuck?
(<i>escape (the pina colada song)</i>
playing)
garv: this way.
hey, eduardo!
(grunts)
he's really cranky.
(indistinct talking on tv)
that's russ.
he's got an attitude.
you're such a slowpoke.
come on.
(operatic music playing)
it's okay. do it again.
do it again.
one more time.
that's good. i like that.
hey, karl!
oh, my god! you scared me!
you scared me, sneaking up on
me like a little squirrel!
you have a visitor.
karl: dude,

you're going to get track marks
all over my mahogany floors.
are you serious?
go get me a smoothie.
get out of my face.
garv: you're no fun.
karl: you're no fun.
oh, my god. hi. hi.
you must be noah griffith.
i've been waiting for you all night.
what's up?
i'm karl with a
sorry about the banging.
we're doing some slight renovations,
as you can see.
we're knocking down some walls
so we can get a little more
square footage in here.
a little more elbow room.
uh, that's awesome.
what's awesome about it?
huh?
why is that awesome?
more room for bodybuilders
and experiments and stuff.
(laughs)
that's funny!
you're funny, noah griffith.
you're really funny.
thank you.
you're very cool as well. so...
you sure we haven't met?
déjà vu.
hey, check this out.
this is an art project.
it's made from the shell of
an ancient baby dinosaur egg.
we like to package our
product artistically.
and prehistorically. bump?
i'm fine, thanks.
(karl snorting)
(laughing)
i like you, noah griffith!
you're so shy.
you're so gorgeous and shy.

she was asian.
are you biracial?
karl! i got shot!
oh, my god.
i got shot, karl.
oh, my god.
don't let me die
on this floor, karl.

he shot me in my tummy.
karl: oh, my god.
please, someone, please!
somebody get me a doctor!
please, someone...
do you know cpr?
what? i don't know.
do you know cpr?
i don't even

particular situation.

(whining)
karl, don't let me die!
i have kids, man.
my god. jesus christ.
fucking hell!
somebody help me.
fine! what?

he's going into shock.

karl: got you!
what's happening right now?
i don't understand. are you okay?
what, is this a joke?
i got him! i got him!
i could smell your breath that time.
you were so close.
what's happening?
you're so adorable.
you just fell
for a little prank.
prank?
around here,
we pull pranks and shit
to make sure people
aren't undercover pigs
'cause we kill
pigs around here.
this is julio,
my business partner.
this is kool-aid, man.
karl: come on over here.
let's get down to business.
(loud music
playing on stereo)
slater: right there,
there are prostitutes
and there are people with guns.
and i don't want
to get shot tonight.
(singing) <i>she ain't nothin' but a hoochie
mama hoodrat, hoodrat hoochie mama</i>
<i>oh, i love those big brown eyes</i>
<i>and the way you
shake your thighs</i>
<i>acting like you're so damn cute</i>
<i>just let your boy
just slide them boots</i>
karl: you got my money?
noah: yeah.
julio: yeah!
karl: put out your hand.
here's one ticket.
trick or treat, smell my feet.
how do you know marisa?
you know marisa?
she is my girlfriend, actually.
(laughing)
come on, man, stop it!
karl.
there's some kid here.
karl: you didn't call
the fuzz, did you, noah?
no. rodrigo.
what are you doing? go back to the car.
how'd you even get in here?
i pee-pee now.
he's with you?
yeah, i'm, uh babysitting.
babysitting?
you need to go back to the car,
because you already
went pee-pee. okay?
i pee-pee.
pee your pants.
what's your problem, man?
let him take a piss!
trying to make a little kid
hold in his pee-pee!
that's right. <i>oye,</i> fonzie.
(speaking spanish)
you go pee-pee
karl: don't make a mess!
come in for a bear hug.
get outta here.
put that handshake away.
better hug this motherfucker if
you know what's good for you.
hug him tight!
swordfight up in this motherfucker!
pull it together!
(groans)
karl: have a great night.
(grunts)
okay, i know we had a few
setbacks, but we're almost done.
i just gotta drop off this
package to my girlfriend,
say a quick hi-ho to her,
then i'm going to turn us
around and take us home.
i know i can be a bit
of a prick sometimes,
so i want to thank you guys
for being patient.
blithe: okay,
so we're gonna go
to my favorite
club in new york city,
and you're gonna come...
hey, buddy, what you got there?
rodrigo: i no know.
i find it in bathroom.
shit!
rodrigo,
give that to me right now.
i'm serious, man.
give it to me right now.
no way. finder keepers.
put it in my hand right now!
no.
rodrigo.
no.
just... just let go!
it's mine.
let it go!
just give it to me!
blithe: you're both such booger faces.
stop fighting!
let go!
okay.
it's snowing!
what the fuck?
(phone ringing)
hello?
<i>noah griffith!</i>
hey!
hey, karl, what's up?
how did you get this number?
i got it off
your facebook page,
as i was trying to friend you
as you were walking out.
anyway, as i was friending
you, julio noticed that
maybe you stole a baby
dinosaur egg from me.
and it's just,
like, i'm confused.
you know what i mean?
because i'm thinking that we're friends,
and then all of a sudden,
i don't know, it's like...
i really liked you, you know?
karl, just relax, please.
i'm sorry, i don't have your drugs.
<i>the kid i'm babysitting,
he took one of your eggs,</i>
<i>and i was trying to get it back</i>
<i>and it accidentally
splashed in my face.</i>
<i>fucking shut the fuck up.</i>
<i>unless i get my drugs back</i>
<i>or my money back,
i'm going to kill you!</i>
<i>i'll fucking kill you!</i>
<i>i want you to meet me
at wing's fish market.</i>
where?
wing's fish market.
it's in chinese town.
<i>you meet me there in one hour with
my 10 grand, or you're dead meat.</i>
um, okay. thanks, bye.
i have to go pee-pee now.
you're holding it in
this time, asshole.
it'll be all right.
i thought he was my friend.
it's all right.
shut up!
i wanna go home.
(speaks spanish) i don't
know what you're saying.
don't. stop it!
stop! no!
blithe: no, my lip gloss!
give it back!
shut up! shut up!
shut the fuck up!
what are you
getting mad at us for?
because rodrigo here is a thief,
and now i'm in deep shit.
and the worst
part of all of this
is that i'm stuck
here with you three.
you, you got more issues
than a magazine stand.
and, you, wipe the makeup
off your face, picasso.
what are you, a mob wife?
and, you, you're the worst.
i know you're a little kid,
and i know i'm not
supposed to say this
kind of stuff to you,
but fuck you.
fuck you so much.
you're a douche.
look, noah,
if you hate us that much,
then just drop us
off with our parents.
you know what?
that's an amazing idea. let's go.
<i>i've seen the way
you look at me</i>
<i>i know the things you say
when i'm not there</i>
<i>but when you're here
alone with me</i>
<i>baby, don't pretend
that you don't care</i>
<i>come on, let the feeling begin</i>
<i>come on, baby come on, yeah</i>
<i>don't stop
when the feeling begins</i>
come on. i've changed my mind.
i need to clean up my mess myself.
all right, ideas,
ideas, ideas, ideas, ideas.
okay. slater,
can you get off the phone?
i need an idea. you can text
your buddy clayton later, okay?
yeah, man, seriously!
slater: it's not clayton.
it's those twins,
and they want me to
go to prospect hall
for wendy sapperstein's
bat mitzvah.
that's, like, a pretty
swanky joint, right?
yeah, the sappersteins
are totally loaded
and she's, like, crazy spoiled.
spoiled.
so lots of gifts, lots of cash.
slater, you're a genius.
you're a genius, dude!
all right, let's go,
let's go, let's go!
let's go, let's go, let's go!
hustle!
all right, come on, kids.
come on.
all right, thank you.
blithe: this place
looks like a party.
noah: keep walking,
keep walking.
wendy: maybe you should
just invite anyone you know,
anyone who's ugly, because
they seem to all be here!
mrs. sapperstein:
that's very nice.
is that what
the rabbis taught you?
mom! this is my night.
it's my celebration,
and i did not invite these
nerds to my bat mitzvah!
what more can i do for you?
rent the taj ma-fucking-hal for you?
there's so much blue cheese
here, it smells like barf, mom!
damn, wendy sapperstein's
a big ol' bitch!
yeah, she scares me.
all right, guys, we're gonna
stay under the radar.
okay? keep it low profile.
did you hear what i just said?
i said low profile!
all right?
stop puncturing balloons!
do you understand me? (shushing)
noah, noah. does this place
have bottle service?
i want a red bull and vodka.
no, you don't.
you don't even know
what that is.
it's bad for you.
slater! you showed up!
we've been looking
all over for you!
oh. hey.
twin 1: we've been
dancing all night.
twin 2: yeah, this bat
mitzvah is the best!
it's like jew city out there,
and we're the fucking mayors.
you ready to go dance?
he's ready to go dance.
this guy was born to dance.
you want to come?
come on. let's go.
you big stud.
time to go make
a slater sandwich!
some of that gingerbread,
my man.
no bathrooms, you understand me, rodrigo?
no <i>baño.</i>
(speaking spanish)
you're a <i>pendejo.</i>
you're a <i>puto.</i>
you're a <i>puta</i>, bitch.
i'm gonna fuck you up, dawg!
noah griffith?
uh, hey.
that's you, right?
yeah. what's up?
how's it going?
it's roxanne.
i lived in the dorms down the
hall from you, freshman year.
that's right.
we were in astronomy, right?
yeah, i sat behind
you in astronomy.
we were, like, the only two
students who seemed to give a shit.
(chuckles)
that's right. yeah.
you made that scale model of
saturn with a cantaloupe, right?
oh, shit, yeah.
that was you.
that thing was fresh.
that was cool. yeah, that was me.
did you know about the
geomagnetic storm tonight?
i did. i'm gonna
check it out. are you?
i'm actually kind
of excited for it.
yeah. for sure.
yeah, it's gonna be cool.
yeah, it's gonna be pretty cool.
bandleader: stay on that dance floor!
it's time for the hora!
(guests cheering) wow!
<i>hava nagila</i>, yeah.
you gonna go on the chair?
i don't think so.
yeah?
no. no chair for me.
i can't believe you're here.
like, i haven't seen you in forever.
yeah, i'm actually
not in school this year.
that sucks.
but i'm working
right now, obviously.
but once i get off work,
i'm going to a pool hall
with some of my co-workers.
would you want to come?
oh, cool.
that would be great,
but i'm actually
in the middle of
a situation currently.
oh, yeah. no worries.
i just thought i'd ask.
no. thank you.
any other time.
oh, my god.
oh, shit.
it was great
running into you again.
(laughing) oh, my god!
put your fucking dick away!
you're getting
piss all over me!
you're getting
piss all over my feet!
watch out. come on.
blithe: happy birthday, wendy!
noah: mazel <i>tov,</i> wendy.
(blithe yelling)
what were you doing?
you do not take a piss in the
middle of a party, okay?
you don't piss in the middle
of a bat mitzvah, you idiot!
clayton?
(softly) oh, shit.
what are you doing here?
what about your tarantula?
oh, i got over that, man
it's just a spider, bro.
since when do you hang out
with benji gillespie?
look, i can hang out with as
many other people as i want.
i don't think you
understand that.
i'm getting kind of sick of going
to your house all the time
and watching tennis.
we do other shit.
no, we don't!
you don't do anything!
i can't just
always hang around you.
i don't get why
you're being mean to me.
he doesn't want to hang out
with you any more, bro.
how hard is it to
understand that?
just stop calling and texting
him all the time. it's weird.
is that true?
see you around.
yo.
hey, man. you all right?
those guys fucking with you?
yeah, i'm fine.
you okay?
yeah, just leave me alone!
hi. i'm so sorry to
have to say this to you.
it's just that i can't
seem to find your car.
what do you mean,
you can't find my car?
well, i think we lost it.
you didn't lose your morrissey box set.
where's my fucking car, dude?
(sobs)
did you lose it or you
taking a shit right now?
a little of both.
there's no "a little
bit" of taking a shit.
you're either shitting
your pants or you're not.
stop crying, all right?
it's not going to solve anything.
let's go find this shit.
all right?
hey, look! there it is!
oh, thank god we found it.
that's not finding it, you idiot.
someone stole it.
oh, poo.
three thousand bucks.
is that good?
no. it's not. we need 7,000 more.
and it's almost 11:00.
hey, noah, i have an idea.
how about you start your own
signature fragrance?
that's a great idea!
i'll just alert
my team of scientists,
have them invent a new perfume.
we'll start
selling it and we'll have
seven grand in
the next 45 minutes!
you're such a jerk.
god damn it, my fucking shin.
i'm just trying to help.
all i know is, is i'm going
to be a famous celebrity
who designs on the side,
and i'm going to be rich.
what the hell are
you talking about?
you do know that just
being a celebrity and
having a good time is
not a real job, right?
yeah, it is!
being a famous celebrity
is the greatest
thing in the world!
it means people
take your picture.
you get to have
birthday parties at
the coolest clubs
and dance on tables.
even for a small child,
you sound like an idiot.
(noah sighs)
what are you walking away for?
what's your problem,
drama queen?
my problem is that
my best friend clayton
doesn't want to hang out
with me any more
because he
doesn't like me back,
and he'd rather hang out with an
asshole named benji gillespie.
that is my problem!
okay, well...
you'll make another friend.
no.
no, i won't.
well, i don't know the inner
workings of your friendship,
but if he doesn't
like you, then screw him.
(horn blaring)
all right, train's coming!
let's go!
<i>if you only knew
what it was like</i>
<i>hoping that you see the light</i>
<i>and you always put up a fight</i>
<i>i get lost within your stare</i>
(inaudible)
<i>when we breathe the same air</i>
<i>i see you everywhere</i>
<i>oh, if you only knew</i>
blithe: whoa.
noah: it's like
actual china.
excuse me.
is this wing's fish market?
you must be noah griffith.
mr. karl is expecting you.
wait here, all right?
so.
did you get my money?
(clears throat) um...
garv, can i get some
chili flakes, please?
(music playing on headphones)
garv, honey.
look at me. look at me!
uh, yes,
i have money right here.
garv? oh, boy.
here you go. i got it.
not listening.
he's got the headphones on.
i got the cash right here for you.
here you go.
so how do you guys
all know each other?
karl: what the fuck
difference does it make?
julio: we got a problem.
what's the problem?
my man! you got $3,000 here.
you are short $7,000!
short?
okay, i have checks.
are you kidding me?
checks, yes.
checks! what's the matter
with you? (laughing)
who the fuck is
wendy sapperstein?
the sappersteins are loaded,
so they're not gonna
miss the money at all.
garv! please, chili flakes!
you don't listen!
so you can sign
the check over to yourself.
karl: i'll count to three.
one.
sign the checks over?
two. yeah, sign the
checks over to yourself.
three. good night.
(garv crying out in pain)
did you hear that?
garv: (sobbing)
why'd you do that?
drop him off at the podiatrist.
make his mom a mix cd
with an apology letter.
(wailing)
julio: i told you, dawg.
now your foot match your asshole.
(speaking cantonese)
hey!
<i>hey, karl!</i>
hey, marisa.
where you at?
i'm at a party!
a party?
what?
i'm always down to party.
all right, text me the address.
all right, baby.
we're gonna meet you at
this party at midnight.
if you don't
have my seven grand,
julio's gonna tickle your
girlfriend's asshole with a feather.
how'd you get that name
"the feather" again?
let me tell the story, man.
my joint got a little curve to it.
so i go up in there, and it
tickles the lady's asshole.
tickle, tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle.
my joint goes in and comes
out at the same time
you know what i'm saying?
tickle, tickle.
tickle, tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle. yeah.
(both laughing)
see, when i'm stoking,
i see the head,
although i'm in it,
my head is popping out.
still, like that.
like a u-turn.
my joint make
a u-turn in that ass.
the feather is in
effect since 1981, son.
my joint be
pop-locking in that ass.
it go in your ass and come
out your ass, like that.
see what i'm saying?
come here. give me a hug.
give him <i>a</i> fucking hug!
don't be shy.
you're so shy. come here.
hug me tight.
it's okay.
it's our little secret.
but i want you to
think about something.
garv was my third
best friend in the world,
and i shot him in the feet
for being a bad listener.
you're my eighth
best friend in the world,
and you stole from me.
from my home!
you're gonna meet me
at that party at midnight.
and if you don't
get my seven grand,
let's just say
it's gonna be bad.
real fucking bad!
now get out of here!
stop staring at me
with those gorgeous eyes.
all right, guys, let's go.
can we go home?
no, i have to see somebody.
i don't want to see anybody.
let's just go home.
believe me, slater, i don't want
to see this person, either.
(doorbell rings)
god damn it.
hey, beth?
noah. what are
you doing here?
i am babysitting
these children.
looks like we finally have
something in common, right?
i'm not your
babysitter any more, noah.
oh, you're not. that's right!
because you fucked my dad
while he was still married to my
mom and ruined my life. i forgot!
is he home, by the way?
seven thousand dollars?
yes.
there is no way in hell i'm
giving you seven grand, so...
dad, you screwed mom and i out
of child support and alimony.
just do this one thing.
we'll call it even. all right?
you know, i have to say, it is
always some justification with you.
you are never gonna grow up
with that attitude.
okay, don't do that.
don't do that. okay?
don't pretend like
you care how i turn out.
let's be very, very
straightforward with one another.
okay?
okay.
i'm in a jam. okay?
that's why i'm here,
because i need your help.
and i'm sorry.
i just need you to be my dad for a day.
that's it.
and i'm sorry.
i can't help you.
you know what, pal?
it's not my problem.
i mean, it's really
not my problem.
okay.
daddy? can we look
at the telescope now?
oh, hey, buddy.
of course.
excuse me a second.
i want you to do me a favor.
i want you to go in the kitchen
and get a little bite to eat
for the two of us.
i'll be right in, okay?
that a boy!
there's a geomagnetic
storm tonight. i forgot.
i got thrown off.
so...
i didn't even know.
yeah, i have to go.
you smell like perfume.
you got a lot of perfume on you.
i know. i know i do.
why?
gotcha, bitch.
blithe: shotgun!
noah: all right, come on, let's go!
let's roll. hustle.
rodrigo, feel free to take a piss in it.
blithe: fancy car.
it smells like hotdogs.
was that woman at the door
your babysitter?
she was, till i found out
my dad was tipping her extra
when he'd drive
her home at night.
slater: where are we going?
noah: just got to
pick up something
from my dad's store real quick.
slater: you're breaking in?
not exactly.
(alarm ringing)
blithe: shouldn't you tell
him about this or something?
slater: what's wrong?
i'm typing in the code,
and it's not working.
you didn't do it right!
yes, i did.
i'm doing it right.
(alarm continues ringing)
maybe your dad
changed the code.
he didn't change the code.
okay? the code's my birthday.
it's always been my birthday.
he didn't change it.
maybe it's
someone else's birthday.
(alarm stops ringing)
sorry, man.
let me guess what it is.
(beeps)
booyah!
can i tell you my gossip now?
oh, shit, yeah. blithe.
not now. i think we should go, okay?
let's go. we gotta go.
i saw my daddy
kissing his assistant, debra.
that's why he always <i>stays</i>
late at the hospital,
'cause he spends
all night kissing debra.
my mom knows.
she pretends like she doesn't
know, but she knows.
that's not gossip, blithe.
you know that, right?
well...
sometimes people do messed-up
stuff to each other, okay?
why?
one time i was
walking down the street,
i punched my best friend darius
in the nut sack for no reason.
just both fists.
just double-punched him.
why would you do that?
i don't know.
you're an idiot.
that's probably true.
i am an idiot.
and so is your dad.
come on.
hey.
where's rodrigo?
he's in the bathroom.
(toilet flushing)
(ominous cowboy music playing)
oh, no.
no, tell me...
tell me you didn't.
(chuckling)
oh, shit!
why the hell did
you do that, rodrigo?
blithe: seriously, dude!
you said you didn't have
any more cherry bombs!
how many more do you have, huh?
you can't just go around blowing
up bathrooms! it's not cool!
why can't you be more like
your brother and sister?
they're at least half crazy.
you're full-on nuts!
they are not my brother and sister!
they are nothing to me!
they are not my family!
she does nothing
all day but paint
her face like a <i>puta.</i>
she is a <i>puta!</i>
and this one is
sick in the head!
he goes to the head doctor
four times a week!
(speaking spanish)
hey! stop acting
crazy, okay?
he is the crazy one.
he has this medicine!
he <i>loco!</i> he <i>muy loco!</i>
hey, relax!
shut up!
you shut up with your stupid fanny pack!
i take your fanny pack!
no! no! no, i need that!
stop it! i need that!
my pills! no! no!
noah: what did
you do that for?
slater: pull over!
pull over!
okay! okay!
slater: right now! right now!
noah: okay! okay!
slater! where are you going?
what the fuck is
your problem, man?
(speaks spanish)
noah: slater.
you're not going to
find it, all right?
i need those pills, okay?
i need them.
no, you don't.
yes, i do, okay?
i have serious issues.
you don't have serious issues.
yes, i do! those pills are the
only thing that keep me normal,
and i need them!
i can't do this any more.
slater, you're gay, all right?
what the fuck are
you talking about?
nothing. never mind.
take that back!
take it back, noah!
you're gay. all right?
you're as queer as a football
bat, and that's fine.
and if your therapist hasn't
clued you into that by now,
then you should ask
for your money back, pal.
you ever think
the reason you're so upset
your buddy clayton doesn't
want to hang out any more
is because you have a lot
of special feelings for him
that maybe
he doesn't feel back?
it breaks your heart, man.
and that breaks my heart.
'cause i know
what that feels like.
i feel it all the time.
i don't want to be gay!
i'm not gay!
tough.
i don't want to be a faggot!
hey! do not say shit like that!
do you understand me?
this is the worst night
of my life.
all right, high school
is going to suck.
coming out to your parents, it's
not gonna be a picnic, either.
but trust me when i tell you
that when you get to college,
nobody will care.
and then,
when you graduate college,
you'll get an awesome job
in the entertainment industry.
you'll be super-organized and dress
really well, you'll smell good.
smell good? what are you
talking about, noah?
relax. listen to me.
my dad hates me. all right?
i got kicked out of college.
(sighing)
before tonight,
this babysitting thing,
i've only ever had one job,
and i was a lifeguard.
i got fired after four days
because i kept falling
asleep in the sun.
i'm a constant
disappointment to my mom,
who's the only
decent person in my life.
i've been arrested
numerous times.
i had a month-long, intense
addiction to robitussin.
there's only
one freak out here.
you're looking at him.
i've never had a gay thought in my
life, so what does that tell you?
that tells me
you're pretty messed up.
i have seen <i>devil wears prada</i>
about 19 times,
but that's because
it's a good movie.
it's a good flick.
<i>devil wears p.</i> you ever seen it?
<i>d wears p?</i>
i think, like, once.
i don't really remember it though.
nothing's wrong with you.
you're normal.
just super gay.
you're a dick.
(laughs) yes, that's true.
enough of the pills, all right?
okay.
you know,
deep down, i think
i always kind of knew.
(sighs) but don't tell
anybody yet, okay?
i won't. i won't.
what do you think
lam, an asshole?
(laughing) yeah, sort of.
come on, ricky martin,
let's get out of here.
slater: that's an example.
hey, slater, are you okay?
yeah, i'm okay.
hey! that's mom's car!
noah: are you sure?
(beeping)
all right.
let's go! let's go!
blithe: rodrigo’s jacket
must be in there!
(people talking indistinctly)
blithe: this is
my kind of club.
slater: let's just go home.
noah: no.
all right? i have a half-hour
to get to this party,
pay off karl,
pick my girlfriend up
off the floor,
get you kids home,
and be home in time for my mom to
tell me how awesome her night was.
i'm not gonna let some bullshit
car thief fuck this up for me.
hey.
what's happening, my man?
how you doing, man?
you know, this ain't
no place for no kids.
these aren't kids,
these are little people.
this woman's 48 years old.
her children have children.
hi. i'm a grandma.
all right.
what's your name, baby?
they call me soul, soul baby.
soul baby?
keep it in control, baby.
i hear you, baby.
my name's
noah j-bird. (caws)
noah j-bird.
oh, you like to fly.
i fly, baby.
fly, fly, fly away, baby.
in the clouds, no frowns.
all right, now, that's
what i'm talking about.
tears, no fears, man.
is that right?
respect it, don't neglect it.
all right. that's what i'm
talking about, baby. my brother.
treat it, don't beat it, my man.
all right, baby.
you're a badass motherfucker.
(music playing)
hey.
(groans)
god, man.
what's up, white boy?
i'm here for my minivan.
what's up?
(laughs) get out of here.
what, are you stalking me now?
you're stealing my car?
i'm serious.
give me the keys.
look, homey, we got beef.
you understand that?
just give me the keys.
step back, homey!
this ain't where you belong!
all right, you're going
to listen to me, okay?
you're right, i threw up in
your grandmother's ashes.
hell, yeah, you did.
it was an accident.
fucked up.
i apologize from
the bottom of my heart.
i have been stuck babysitting
these three kids.
i was talked into buying
cocaine for my girlfriend,
who i realize is not
even my girlfriend.
she's just a girl
who occasionally
lets me stick
my face in her crotch
and who's mean to me all the time.
okay? (all laugh)
and this time, making her happy
is probably
gonna get me killed.
you're acting all gangster, stealing
cars, hanging out with thugs.
well, you know what?
a few years ago we went to the
same lame-ass high school.
the point is, you and i
are two fucked-up kids
meeting on the playground.
i came here for my motherfucking
keys to my motherfucking minivan,
and that's what's up!
(all laughing)
is that supposed to be
a threat, little man?
i ain't giving you shit.
it's not a threat.
i'm going to put both my
hands behind my back,
and you get one punch to my
face as hard as you want.
i can punch you in the face?
you deserve to
punch me in the face.
go on, baby.
punch him in the face.
(whispers) my face
is ready to receive you.
noah, don't!
what?
crowd: oh!
tina: bitch.
blithe: noah!
i fucking love you right now.
you killed my babysitter!
noah?
(groans) that was bad.
blithe: are you okay?
yeah.
(all exclaim in surprise)
oh, shit. i'm all right!
i'm okay!
(all applauding)
i'm okay!
she won this round, right?
oh, shit.
she punched my face, but it's cool!
it's all good.
looks like we're even.
guess you ain't the little pussy
you used to be. huh, noah?
nope, i'm a whole
different pussy now.
all right, boy. respect.
unlock it. what's inside?
oh, shit, it's a bomb.
hell, yeah. i feel that.
noah: let that debris
fall across your face, girl.
look here, little homey.
i like your style, you dig?
i appreciate that.
thank you.
you stand up for yours,
and i can respect that.
if we ever need a crazy-ass white
boy to roll with us one day
and get punched in the face by
motherfuckers, i'm-a call you.
know what i mean?
yeah, man.
yo, listen. listen.
let me holler at you for a second.
i just wanna let you know,
i just want to throw a monster
shout-out back at you, my man.
monster shout-out
back at me, right?
i don't understand
what the fuck that is,
but it sound good, though.
it's all good, baby.
all right, brother.
peace to you.
i fucking love you, dawg.
noah, are you all right?
(hoarsely) i feel
so cool right now.
(laughing)
this place is cool.
i honestly might start dj-ing here.
i don't know.
okay, that's all right,
but do you really think that this is
an appropriate place to bring kids?
i don't know. look, rodrigo's over
there chatting up some prostitutes.
you got slater schooling bell
biv devoe over there in pool.
and blithe's doing the riverdance
over in the bowling alley.
honestly,
this is the first time
i've seen them
having any kind of fun,
so what the hell?
you know what that is?
what is that?
just me being cool.
playing it cool.
no big deal.
you're crazy.
you're crazy
slash beautiful. whatever.
so, did you drive here?
no, i took a cab.
maybe you should
take my dad's car,
because i can't drive
both of them anyways.
are you serious?
yeah, it'd actually
really help me out.
okay. how are
you gonna find me?
do you have a phone?
okay. see you.
yeah. (laughs)
just kidding.
here, this is my phone number,
and then you can call me.
okay.
i'll call you.
hey, uh,
why did you say something to me
when you saw me earlier?
i feel like
you kind of ignored me
all freshman year.
i don't know. i thought you
were really funny and smart
and seemed really sweet.
i guess i was kind of nervous
to talk to you back then.
you were nervous to talk to me?
yeah.
(mobile ringing)
my phone's ringing.
shit, it's my girlfriend.
i'm sorry. i have to take this.
girlfriend.
yeah.
hello?
all right. see you later.
call me about the car.
yeah.
noah.
noah: <i>listen to me you need
to leave that party right now.</i>
noah, this party is breathtaking,
so i'm not gonna leave it.
breathtaking?
marisa, listen to me.
<i>you need to listen to me.
you have been jerking me around all night.</i>
and you wanna know what?
it's disrespectful and it's lame.
just, if karl and julio show
up, stay away from them.
they're dangerous.
<i>they're not dangerous.
you're being an idiot.</i>
i'm very close.
i'm coming for you, marisa, okay?
<i>okay</i>
(siren squawking)
oh, shit.
i can't decide if
this is funny or not.
noah: it's not funny at all.
how you doing tonight, my man?
do you have any idea
why i stopped you?
no.
you ran a red light
and you're not
wearing your seat belt.
all right, why don't you
step out of the car, pal?
do me a favor.
put your hands on the trunk.
officer: easy, cowboy.
what's this?
it's a <i>luchador</i> action figure.
luchadors, i love these guys.
look at this.
frank, what's in there?
what's this, my man?
(sighs)
you got a little
party in your pocket?
it's not mine, i swear to god.
i'm just holding it
for my girlfriend.
i'm just holding it for her.
you're going out
with a cokehead?
bag of fucking
actual diamonds here.
oh. okay. jacob the jeweler.
you're tits in a ditch, my man.
tits in a ditch.
is that good?
sometimes it's good.
sometimes it's real bad.
what is that?
oh, no shit!
is that you?
that's the fucking bathroom guy!
mr. toilet explosion?
that's not me.
i've never actually
been the guy on duty
to catch the fucking
guy in the sketch.
what are they doing to him?
do me a favor.
you got this? yeah.
you got it?
yeah. i like that.
that's one for your wallet.
check it out! check it out!
it's great.
all right, sir, do me a favor,
go stand by your vehicle.
we're going to run
your profile. all right?
this is mine.
i'm gonna take responsibility...
sir! go stand by your vehicle.
please.
hey, so here's the deal.
i think i'm about
to get arrested.
i messed up and i put
your lives in danger.
you's got the diamonds?
noah: things just got out of
hand so quickly... (both grunt)
let's party!
and i'm really, really sorry.
(engine starting)
whoa. are they leaving?
hey! what are
you doing? stop!
please! i need those diamonds!

damn it! (groans)
(dance music playing)
all right, i'm going to
go find my girlfriend.
marisa!
marisa!
stephanie,
have you seen marisa?
i don't know, it's my birthday!
why are you upside down?
why aren't you upside down?
okay.
take care of yourself.
you're not invited any more.
g-bert, sorry to
interrupt, man.
what's up, noah?
have you seen marisa?
who's marisa?
she's my girlfriend.
she's like my height,
blonde hair.
no, sorry.

if i find her, we should all
hang out next week or something.
totally, yeah.
yeah, great.
you have great breasts. thanks.
thank you.
later, noah.
what are you doing?
fuck you.
why are you such
an asshole, rodrigo?
ever since
you moved in with us,
you've been so mean
to everybody!
what's wrong with you?
you want to know
what's wrong with me?
this is my third family
in three years.
when your papas
get tired with me,
they give me to
another families.
that happens every time.
well, maybe if you didn't do
such messed-up stuff
then they would actually feel
like you wanted to be here.
you don't know me.
you look at me
like a crazy that live
in your house.
that's not true.
you never talk to us.
honestly,
you're pretty scary, man.
i no scary.
i just like having fun.
boom, boom, boom. kaboom.
hey, guys, i can't find
marisa anywhere. let's go.
come on. where's blithe?
blithe, get down from there.
we have to go.
these are my friends!
come on, we're having fun.

making fun of you, okay?
you need to get down here right now.

i obviously have to go say hi.
ricky!
noah: you're drunk, marisa.
hey.
marisa.
what's up? how are you?
you haven't responded to any of my
texts in, like, a really long time.
yeah. there's a reason
for that.
marisa, i'm sorry.
i don't know how else i can say it.
we had a great run,
but it's over now,
and i wish you the best
and i pray for you, i do.
is everything okay?

ricky's being kind of a dick.
why don't you defend me, noah?
both: what?
yeah. you're being
a real dick!

you're being mean!
what are you talking about?
i've been nothing but cool to you, man.

(mouthing)
no offense, bro,
but who are you?
i'm noah. we're dating.
marisa: he's my friend.
we're in a relationship, okay?
friendship relationship.
well, good luck with that, bro,
'cause dealing with her
is a pretty big nightmare.
i don't envy you.
that is a terrible thing
to say to somebody!
what?
look, you hurt her feelings.
okay? just be nice.
what are you going
to do about it, bro?
what?
what the hell was that?
a throat jab? i don't know.

rodrigo: go, noah!

into a new friendship!
i just don't want to deal
with a broken heart.
maybe i don't want to be friends!

noah: it's just i've been

marisa, why don't you do me a favor?
take these kids and go home.
i'm going to have an adult
conversation with the babysitter.
look, i know you guys want to
stay with me, it's your instinct,
but you have to
fend for yourself.
karl: oh, you're

yeah. i got a little
boo-boo myself.
you're mean!
noah griffith!

blithe: marisa, wait!

no, i didn't hear anything.
it's your very childlike
and vivid imagination.
noah might be hurt!
that's a <i>pistola.</i>
what if he needs us?
he's not in trouble.
he's hugging it out with karl in the minivan.
i just need to get out of here.

(sobbing) okay, fine!
i'm a terrible person.
okay? i admit it, i could be a
lot better in this situation,
but i'm just feeling really overwhelmed.
i don't know what's going on.
i'm stuck with these three

on people who don't value them.
you're right.
i haven't been cool to you.
i know.
you haven't.
and i'm over it, too.
take care of yourself, marisa.
all right?
blithe:
your girlfriend sucks.
yes, she does.
indeed she does.
blithe, i want to
show you something.
just because you try and
look more grown up,
or try and act
like a celebrity,
or a famous person or whatever,
it's not gonna
get you more friends.
you're a kid.
and a pretty great one.
wipe that shit off your face.
you look insane, okay?
okay.
you know what "blithe" means?
what?
it means "joyous."
slater: you know
what "late" means?

hello.
hey, guys!
hi. what?
hey! welcome back!
what's going on?
it's after 1:00 in the morning.
these kids should be
in bed already, noah.
mom, it's not his fault.
yeah. we told him
our bedtime was 1:30.
i turned the clock back. so sorry.
my deepest apologies.
noah: you darn kids!
played a trick on me,
these little rascals.
i'm not buying it.
everybody, upstairs.
bed! now.
go brush your teeth.
blithe: sorry, mom.
(sighs) and say
good night to noah.
maybe he'll be nice enough to
come back and babysit again.
kids: night, noah.
night, guys.
and peter has your money, okay?
cool, thanks.
oh, noah!
your mom told me to tell you
not to wait up for her.
she and that guy
that i set her up with,
dr. stevens, went out
to have a nightcap.
let me tell you, i think she
was having a really good time.
thanks for hooking that up.
thanks for babysitting.
see you next time.
i trust the kids
weren't too much trouble.
you got three great ones.
hey...
(sighing) you want
a recommendation?
here's my advice.
get your shit together.
you're right.
maybe i do have some stuff
i need to work on.
but the last person on earth
i need to take advice
from is you, sir.
excuse me?
you're banging your assistant,
debra, and you're going to stop.
do you understand me?
i would be very careful
how you talk to me.
you'd better be very careful
how you talk to me.
because i'm going to be at
home with nothing going on.
and i'm going to have one eye
on my three friends up there
and the other eye right on you.
i just want you to get
your act together, doc.
(softly) fucking...
one more thing.
your wife's smoking hot.
you need to get rid of debra
and focus on tapping that ass.
and there may be a scratch
or two on your minivan!
(car honking)
hey, stranger!
need a ride?
hey, roxanne. what's up?
hey.
how'd you find me?
oh, this little gizmo kept beeping,
so i followed it to find you.
which is a little creepy
now that i think about it.
that's okay.
thank you for stalking me.
(both chuckling)
(mobile ringing)
shit.
oh. let me guess.
your girlfriend again?
no.
we broke up.
oh. and you're just fine?
you seem fine.
yeah, no, i'm great.
she's in hysterics, but she'll be
cool, eventually. she'll move on.
