shoot that close to those guys.
oh, hey, hey, hey.

i know how to use
a computer, randall.
yeah, of course you do.
i mean, it's the same old thing we
had when you were on the job.
okay, well, you let
me know how it goes.
good morning.
i'm going to be teaching the class today.
mrs. edwards has had a family emergency.
hey, did you hear what happened?
some illegals killed mrs. mcnary.
- mrs. mcnary?
- she was riding on her ranch,
and they were trying to steal
her horse, and they killed her.
young lady in the front,
please turn around.
i have to use the bathroom.
<i>si.</i>
says he's sure.
roy's here.
hey, hey, hey, hey! come on, now.
come on, back off.
that's not the guy i saw.
you're sure?
yeah, i'm sure.
- well, then, there may have been two.
- why do you say that?
well, we picked him up
in a stolen truck, and...
one of the things we found in the
truck was this. you recognize this?
yeah.
soon as we told him what happened,
he started talkin' pretty fast.
he told us that he and another
guy that he was traveling with...
met up with a woman on a horse,
and she gave him that blanket.
he says that somebody was shooting
at him, and the lady fell off her horse...
- and hit her head.
- that's a bunch of bullshit.
i know, i'm just... just telling
you what the man said,
keeping you in the
loop like i promised.
i should have shot that son of
a bitch when i had the chance.
i saw that you had a firearm
on you when we got there.
- were you shootin' at 'em, roy?
- no.
- you sure?
- yeah, i'm sure.
- there were shots.
- there were shots?
yeah, they were rifle shots. that's why
i went out there in the first place.
well, why the hell didn't you tell me that
before? that's pretty damned important.
i don't know, i...
hell, randall, i mean, we was...
all right, somethin' else.
now, our man in there i.d.'d the
same guy you did in the mugs.
- he did?
- he did.
- hello, matthew.
- how are you, martha?
good, good. got that good
apple wine ready for you.
- that's why i'm here.
- okay.
- there you go.
- thank you.
- you got it.
- all right.
- give my best to your wife.
- i will.
no.
no. oh.
you're sure that's the guy
you standin' over livy, right?
- yeah, that's him.
- well, then i'd say we got our guy.
hmm.
what?
i don't know.
come on, roy. how many times you and
i stood here and watched these boys...
lie through their teeth just so
we'd send 'em back across the line
- with a spanking and a warning?
- a bunch.
i know it's not much for comfort, and
it ain't gonna bring livy back, but...
we got him, and he's
gonna be punished.
did you already have
your boys do a sweep?
yeah, but they didn't find anything,
but now i know you heard those shots too
i'm having 'em do
another broader search.
- yeah, when? i told you that yesterday.
- terrence is doin' a transport,
and matthew and lewis are
pickin' up the slack, so soon.
this afternoon, or early
tomorrow morning, latest.
- i'm gonna go.
- okay.
roy.
we got him.

ashes at your convenience.</i>
uncle roy?
- going for a ride?
- looks that way.
want some company?
no.
no, i don't.
but thank you, kaye.
thanks for offerin'.
you bring that pony back wet,
you'll catch hell from me. understood?
yes, ma'am.
- what are you doin' up here?
- this is where the shooter was.
that's got to be well over 800 yards.
are you sure it was from here?
i saw him from that bluff over there,
above the wash where livy was killed.
that's where i found these.
- roy...
- found the leads down in the wash.
maybe you could match some of those up
with the lead in that body down there.
roy, you know you shouldn't...
you shouldn't have moved these.
hell, you shouldn't even be up here.
this is my land, randall. well,
somebody's got to do your job for you.
check 'em out. they're marked.
shooter must do his own reloads.
did you get a maker on the vehicle?
no. some kind of a
four by four. green.
not many guys around
who can make that shot.
yeah, well, there's plenty of people pretty
angry about what happened to livy, roy.
well, those people got no more business
bein' on my land than the damn mexicans.
randall...
i want to talk to ramirez.
you know i can't allow that.
you're officially a civilian.
besides, you're the spouse of the victim,
and that man is the prime suspect.
- how's it gonna look...
- i spent over 25 years sittin'
in the same chair you park your
butt in now, the chair i put you in.
i know better than anybody that there's
a lot of things you can't do as sheriff,
but lettin' me talk to
ramirez ain't one of 'em.
i have to...
you got five minutes.
jesus, roy.
yeah.
it figures.
no.
<i>- ¿carro?</i>
<i>- si.</i>
no.
oh, hi.
i'm so sorry i'm late.
that's okay. we've just
been here a few minutes.
- i'm marily.
- hi.
how do you like the
front of the house?
- and the neighborhood?
- it's good.
- oh, good.
- good.
i have the code to the garage,
and i can open the front door
and let myself in that way,
and then i can let you in.
ah, there it is.
oh-oh, my...
sean!
sean!
sean louis pat!
what?
your dad wants to see
you in the garage!
why?
why?
- why?
- but he said right now.
those were out on the ground off the
south ridge of roy mcnary's land.
and my .30-06 reloads.
i haven't been out
there huntin', son.
besides, i always pick up my empties.
i even make a mark
on 'em with a sharpie,
just so i can tell
which ones are mine.
those are mine.
any idea how they got out there, son?
what the hell were you thinking?
was this your stupid idea?
don't you turn your back on me!
let me talk. let me talk to him.
well, the boys are tellin'
different stories.
two of 'em are sayin' that they
were shooting at the mexicans...
'cause they were beating on livy
and tryin' to steal her horse.
you know damned well
that's not what happened.
do i?
i mean, you thought those mexicans
were beatin' on livy too.
i sat here and listened to you
tell me when you pulled up,
that mexican was trying
to steal livy's horse.
- randall...
- that's what you said.
what... what do we got here really?
roy, i mean... so now we know that the
boys were shooting at the mexicans.
livy didn't die of a gunshot
wound, roy. that's a fact.
he's my son, for god's sake.
livy was my wife.
who was the shooter?
well, the boys are tellin'
different stories, and they're...
- all trying to back each other...
- randall.
who was the shooter?
sean.
the shooter was sean.
- flora, can it wait?
- just thought both you sheriffs...
might want to know that a lady called
over here just now and said she found
a bunch of illegals hiding
out in a garage in phoenix.
she said one of the illegals asked
her to call over here for her.
she said the woman is
miguel ramirez's wife.
melina ramirez?
<i>si?</i> flora?
jesus. i'll call you
back in a minute.
- roy! roy, you can't take her in there.
- well, flora and i just came by.
- we, uh, both have to pee.
- oh, stop! you can't take her in there!
no, no, don't.
miss flora, she can't be in there.
you can't go in there.
where are the boys at? where's sean?
anybody but ramirez been charged yet?
you know those boys
aren't flight risk.
now, they've been released
to their parents recognizance.
well, that's a dumb idea since it was on
your and their parents recognizance...
that the boys are out there poppin'
off rounds at people in the first place.
- no, you tell them...
- did you talk to the d.a. yet?
you told him what's goin' on here?
you told him about your
boy's involvement? huh?
no, no, no...
you go ahead and you
call him, and you tell him
how you tampered with
the damned evidence!
- hello, señor.
- <i>hola.</i>
thank you for, uh,
bringing <i>mija</i> my house.
<i>gracias.</i>
son-in-law.
oh, <i>si.</i>
<i>bueno.</i>
- evening.
- good evening.
- citizenship?
- american.
- do you have some i.d.?
- i do.
- roy?
- edward.
hi, flora. how are you?
oh, good to see you, edward.
hey, roy, listen. i was really
sorry to hear about livy.
- what are you doing in mexico?
- droppin' off a friend.
- okay.
- okay.
well, it was good to see you both.
same here.
you can't walk in here and tell
me that ramirez is without blame.
i mean, none of this would have happened if
it hadn't been for those goddamn mexicans
- walkin' across your land.
- none of this would have happened...
if you'd changed the combination
on your goddamn gun locker.
okay, but you got to
do one thing for me.
those boys got to pay for what
they did, randall. sean does too.
i know that, and i know he does,
and he's gonna have to live with it...
- for the rest of his life.
- so do i.
all i'm asking you...
is that you say something on
his behalf at the deposition.
i'm asking you as a father,
and as a friend.
it was an accident.
randall...
the only way i will do that is if he tells
the truth about what happened out there.
he will.
you know, being a
dumbass is no excuse.
i know that.
all right.
yours?
mine and my wife's.
- horse man.
- oh, <i>si.</i>
shadow.
yeah.
livy loved her pony.
come on, philly!
advance.
- right.
- okay.
okay.
<i>bueno.</i>
yeah, so you better <i>ándale, señor.</i>
good.
<i>si.</i>
okay.
<i>adios.</i>
