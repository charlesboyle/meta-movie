don't look at anything. it's
just gonna hurt your eyes.
- okay.
- satchel?
come here.
- it's okay. i've got you.
- we need to get off the road and find shelter.
we can't do that on foot.
i need to call our
family, let them know we're okay.
cell phones won't work.
- nothing electronic will.
- why did this happen?
that's not important now.
we only have an hour or so before
the radiation starts coming in.
food, water, supplies, a diesel
vehicle are the priority.
well, what about the interstate?
we could, uh, find someone to help us.
no. we need to stay
away from populated areas
until we know what's going on.
oh, fine.
- come here.
- here, hold this, okay? just stay right here.
all right.
hold this, right there.
all right. oh, shit!
no keys.

no junk food, no empty calories.
no, stay in the car.
stay in the car.
find any kind of batteries you can.
um, baby wipes. we need baby wipes.
- okay... okay. okay, okay.
- okay? let's go.
- where are you headed?
- waco. my car won't start.
how many did you see go off?
there were two to the east,
by the dyess air base in abilene.
one to the north. uh, i don't
know, maybe oklahoma city...
and a whole bunch of huge ones to
the south. probably dallas, fort worth.
they really got us this
time, didn't they?
look, we need to get somewhere
safe. you can hop in the back.
okay.
hello?
hello?
- please go away. go away.
- no, no, no. we just need to find a basement.
oh, my god!
- oh, god! oh, my god! holy shit!
- go, go, go!
are you okay? are you shot?
just go! come on.
we got to get out of here!
- hey!
- i know what you're looking for.
what about this place?
we're running out
of time. it'll have to do.
- where are we?
- it's okay, it's okay. it's gonna be all right.
hello?
hey.
hey.
- don't shoot.
- get the fuck out of here.
i'm a fucking doctor. okay?
come on, mr. franklins.
he said he was a doctor.
now, i've been shot once today
and i'm not gonna be shot again!
now, we have our own food
and we have a lot of water.
we just need a place
to stay. and i'm a doctor.
- i can help you.
- brad, just let him in!
he said he had food.
we got our own water.
we got a water pump!
if you have a water
pump, it's well water.
it will be irradiated soon.
it's not gonna be safe.
look,
i got a sick kid and his sister in the
truck. you have a cellar, right?
yeah, uh-huh.
that's where we've been staying
since the nukes went off.
- get them down there and stay.
- okay.
my name's jonathan.
okay.
is your cellar over there?
look, elizabeth, come here.
all right, we need to cover this with
dirt. pull the truck around back.
anything else around
there, all right?
just get the shovels
out and cover them.
- can you do that?
- yeah.
look, all the food and water
i have is in the truck.
it needs to be in the cellar, now.
- what's your name? angie.
- angie.
i need you to go upstairs,
like, go in the bathrooms,
get all the towels, all the clothes. get
them down into the cellar, all right?
okay. i'll get everything.
- hey.
- yeah.
we need more shovels, all right?
okay, yeah, i have
one in the cellar.
whose house is this?
it's my grandma and
grandpa's house.
- where are they?
- oh, uh, my grandpa has leukemia,
so he's at dallas at the hospital.
grandma's with him, but...
- they're probably dead by now.
- i'm sorry.
i'm just kidding. they're
dead! that's for sure.
could you stop being
an asshole and dig?
bitch.
charming.
who's the moron?
he's our neighbor.
they don't have a cellar, because a lot
of people around here don't have cellars.
but we have a cellar, so...
great.
- angie, right?
- i got all the towels.
i don't think there's
any more up here.
how far along are you?
about seven months.
a little more than that.
like eleven days or so.
hey, hold on.
let me see that.
that's fine.
all right, give the, uh...
give the medicine to the blonde
woman i came with. the calm one.
- hey, do you think he's gonna be okay...
- yeah, he's fine.
is that everything?
truck's empty. what?
relax.
thank god i'm in texas.
this is my granduncle, wendell.
he lives with us now
because we couldn't afford a
home for him after the va cuts.
pleased to meet you, sir.
listen, doc, uh, he's a diabetic.
we have insulin, but we might...
- don't worry about it.
- here.
we got all the food and water down.
you have some more
kerosene lamps upstairs.
we need them down here.
those are grandma's. she's
really into that antique stuff.
but we gotta make sure that
we don't break any of it
- 'cause if she comes back, then, um...
- doc...
doc.
i got a question. you, uh,
took my pistol, remember?
yeah, don't worry
about it. i still got it.
yeah, so do i get a gun?
tell you what, you go a week without shooting
at me again and i'll think about it.
well! that's real nice.
sure good to be able to
see everybody's faces.
yeah, but there's only, uh, three car
batteries, so we have to conserve.
how long do we have
to stay down here?
we are never gettin'
out of here, honey.
at least a month.
depends how widespread all this is.
the, uh, blast radiation isn't good,
but the fallout is a bigger problem.
when a nuclear bomb goes off,
it sucks up dirt and debris into the air
that falls back down like snow.
it's really radioactive,
and it's a particulate.
you... you breathe it in.
oh, my god, dude!
watch out, guys! we can't even
fucking breathe in here now!
i was watching fox news and
it sounded like it was
pretty widespread.
well, i knew about that
magnopulse thing, so i...
i put my mp3 player in the safe so that
we at least have some music to listen to.
i know these things went off all
over asia and north america.
a lot in europe, too, but i don't know
how widespread the radiation is.
i saw at least five of them go off.
but there's no way of knowing how
many megatons the bombs were...
uh, the wind direction
at the time of blast...
i have a shortwave right
here that i'm working on.
but...
it might be broken, though.
grandpa's a pretty big military collector.
i don't know what all's in there.
he never really lets me mess
with any of that stuff.
start nailing up the
cellar doors shut.
and if you have any tape,
seal up the cracks.
god damn it, man!
you haven't gotten this shit all
off the fucking shelf? man, jesus!
- gotta take boxes off it!
- sorry.
fucking poindexter, man!
get this fucking thing off!
fuck!
- what are you doing, man? get a hammer!
- i'm sorry. here.
hey. here.
what is that?
it's a geiger counter.
it measures radiation.
- well, the door's boarded tight.
- shh!
the fallout.
are you fucking crazy?
you're gonna make my wife
piss in a goddamn bucket?
come on, mr. franklins. you
know we can't go upstairs.
hey, professor oppenheimer,
this is the best we can do.
i don't know if you've noticed,
but we don't have a toilet.
kerosene is less dense than water,
urine, or shit, so it'll stay on top.
all right, you can go in.
- and thank you.
- you're welcome.
maybe you should
try fixing the, uh, shortwave radio.
okay.
is he gonna be okay?
his retinas were too badly burned in
the blast. he was looking directly at it.
do you think we should tell him?
i mean, he's been asking me.
i'm gonna go check on angie.
here, baby.
i'm tired. oh, shit.
oh, great.
hey.
- how you doing?
- i'm okay.
- do you mind if i listen for a heartbeat?
- yeah, sure.
okay.
you mind taking a deep breath for me?
there we go.
she's cool, right?
right?
you look a little
young to be a m.d.
what are you doing around here?
i was finishing my residency
at new york university.
wow!
new york!
what?
i'm not doing anything?
i'm just curious.
what are you doing around these parts?
you... i saw your backpack.
you on a walkabout or something?
yeah, something like that.
jesus.
all right, stay...
stay warm, honey.
thank you.
we need to drink a bottle of
water and try to get some sleep.
- and cover up as much as possible.
- that's...
brad, please.
can we just go to sleep?
i don't feel very well.
hey, jonathan. should i be
worried about those two?
i don't know.
sometimes, she'll come over
here to talk to grandma...
and she's always, like, crying.
oh...
oh, um, i got the, um, shortwave
working. well, kind of.
you can use my earphones,
but you can only just listen.
the microphone's not connected yet.
uh, i'm gonna go tuck in grand unc.
- night.
- good night.
- here you go, grand unc.
- hmm...
thank you, jon.
are you gonna be okay, grand unc?
i sure hope my brother's
okay out there.
ah, he'll be all right.
he's a war hero.
you should've seen him.
grandpa, jonathan.
he was the reason i
volunteered for korea.
that was a different war.
- i'm gonna be sleeping behind you, okay?
- hmm... hmm...
so if you need anything...
brad's gonna be a problem.
"we are the hollow men
we are the stuffed men...
you gotta listen to this.
"leaning together
headpiece filled with...
jonathan said we can just hear.
"...over broken glass
in our dry cellar.
"shape without form, shade without...
"...the world ends
"this is the way the world ends
this is the way the world ends
"not with a bang, but a whimper."
this is shenandoah, oklahoma.
is there anybody out there?
this is shenandoah, oklahoma.
is there anybody even out there?
- satchel?
- hmm?
- you okay?
- mmm-hmm. where are we?
what?
- drink some more, okay?
- okay.
it's right here. it's a bottle.
what time is it? does anybody know?
uh, yeah, it's 11:23 a.m.
shit. that's what i have, too.
what do you mean, "shit"?
it's almost completely
dark outside.
what?
it's, like, noon.
yeah. look for yourself.
that doesn't make any sense.
it's the end of the world.
what did you say?
i said, "it's the
end of the world."
you know what?
you shut the fuck
up with that shit!
my fucking pregnant wife is right here.
stop with all this fucking "left
for us" bullshit, all right?
you leave that to your own
psycho head, all right?
- don't talk to my sister like that!
- hey, enough.
all right? we're not gonna
get anywhere like that.
it's not gonna help
this day be any better.
hey, doc.
how you doing, wendell?
you doing all right?
ah, i'm all right.
- just a little tired from all of the excitement.
- let me check something out.
i can't complain.
you're doing all right.
ah...
what have you got there?
um, when this all started, i was
talking to my best friend barry
in minnesota over im.
and he's the one who told me
about the magnetic pulse thing.
he said i might be able
to save some of my stuff
if i put it in a metal
safe or something.
i don't know, man.
maybe if it was lead.
this radio still works.
and, um, i put some of my
grandpa's .38 lead rounds in here.
here's the best part.
still works.
well, that should help
you pass the time.
really, uh...
it just doesn't make any
sense, though. i mean...
it's just dark,
you know? this is...
this is texas, man! it's, like...
it's, like, 55 degrees
in this shit.
you know what i think?
the government, man...
they've gotta have, like...
- there is no government.
- ...something up their sleeve.
there is no government
anymore, brad!
so many of those
things have gone off
that we can't even fucking
see the sun anymore!
look, there's always a
government, all right?
somebody did this to us!
i wanna find out if we did
anything back to them!
who the fuck cares?
hunter and i were on the
shortwave last night,
and everybody is going through the
exact same thing we are, okay?
fucking bitch! i wanna know
what the president did!
i wanna know. i wanna know
what we're doing... fuck! ouch!

by yelling at each other. listen.

you're okay.
astros, huh? i was always
a royals fan, myself.
don't hold it against me.
hey, wendell, you know the best
part about backing a losing team?
what's that?
nowhere to go but up.
you're pretty right, there, doc.
oh, hunter,
the shortwave works now.
i mean, uh... i mean, the microphone's
connected, and the speaker works, too.

for an hour for, like, the past day.
local authorities
are coordinating...
i just figure...
they're just trying to figure out
how to get people into
evacuation centers, you know?

rob...
hey, rob, listen to me, all right?
the bullet went through your wrist.

fuck!
thanks.
here, rob. drink this slowly, okay?
i don't want it.
have they... uh, the town,
have they set up any, um,
evacuation centers or
anything like that?
they tried.
they used the old, uh,
fallout shelter under the library,
but it didn't fit everybody.
there was a lot of fighting.
what about the guard?
the national guard?
they're all overseas.
isn't good out there.
started with a lot of looting.
then the bubbas took over
'cause they had the guns.
second night, there
was a string of rapes.
and they're not letting the
old people have any food.
a lot of people are in
bad shape, all burnt up.
a lot of people
getting really drunk.
others are going crazy looking for
alcohol and drugs because they ran out.
when did the bruises
first appear, rob?
they shot all the migrants.
that's when i ran.
they just lined them
up and shot 'em.
everybody's going crazy and...
that's why i came here.
i was so worried about you, rob.
you know, with grandpa
and grandma and barry...
all dead.
please, you gotta let me stay.
i'm...
all the real sick people, they're...
they're straggling around the town,
looking for food and water, but...
i got my own bottle of water and peanut
butter in my backpack upstairs, okay?
i won't even use your
food, i promise.
please?
i don't wanna go back out there.
this is jonathan's home, and if he
says you can stay, you can stay.
- okay?
- thank you.
"there are wars and rumors of wars,
"but be not troubled for
these things must pass."
oh...
it's okay, it's okay.
shut up!
it's just the radiation setting in.
i'm gonna give you two amoxicillins.
it should help you fight it off.
- hey, brad.
- what?
- is she okay?
- she's... she's fine.
she's just got a little
morning sickness.
- angie, have you been able to eat anything?
- not much.
man, she's fine. it's just harder
for her. she's gotta eat for two.
right, sweetheart?
hey, honey!

jennifer?
jennifer, calm down.
jennifer, breathe. just breathe.
give me your hand.
stay calm. jennifer?
jennifer! get out of the way!
oh, my god!
i'm keeping the gun.
am i gonna die because she bit me?
she was scared, okay?
she was scared of blast burn
and radiation poisoning,
and she was dying and...
she's a refugee of this war.
she's not a movie zombie, okay?
- could have fooled me.
- let me see this.
what are we gonna do about her?
well, brad and i are gonna take
her upstairs to the top floor.
but i'm gonna wait for the
radiation to die down a little bit
before we do that.
"the soldier
now blew upon a green whistle,
"and at once, a young girl, dressed in a
pretty green silk gown, entered the room.
"she had lovely green
hair and green eyes,
"and she bowed low before

"'follow me and i will
show you your room."'
"so dorothy said goodbye to all

a man in an army
uniform came yesterday.
he said it was for the
sake of the nation.
he took my sweet daughter.
i don't really think

spirit for when you meet your maker.
i'll keep that in mind.

hello, this is interim
press secretary collins.
the following is a message that the
president of the united states has written
and requested i deliver to
all citizens of america.
"good morning, my fellow americans.
"the past week has been one
of challenge and tragedy.
"but like all great moments
in our nation's history,
"we have risen to the challenge.
"my friends, i promise you
that i will lead us home.
"now, i assure you that
casualties have been high,
"and our prayers are with those
who grieve, but rest assured...
i cannot believe this bullshit.
"...our enemy casualties
have been higher,
"and we will defeat those
who despise our freedom.
- what about evacuation? my god!
- "there will be further losses
"but in the end, we will prevail.
"and i ask all americans to remain
strong and vigilant, for god is with us."
he isn't saying anything.
he doesn't even have
the courage to say it himself.
he's just having some flunky
read this bullshit statement.
"our military is
still partially functional,
"and will triumph over those
who would destroy us.
"i am honored to be your president,
and i thank you for your prayers.
"thank you all, and
god bless america."
this is the emergency alert system.
local authorities are coordinating
with federal agencies...
he thinks he's a national hero,
and we're all dying here.
presidential legacy!
how did i let her get this far?
i don't know what's wrong with me.
i'm so stupid.
i'm so stupid. dumb.
let me see your hands, brad.
- i'm sorry.
- let me see your feet, brad.
i'm sorry.
"she threw
her arms around the lion's neck
"and kissed him, patting
his big head tenderly.
"then she kissed the tin woodman
"who was weeping in a way
most dangerous to his joints.
"but she hugged the soft, stuffed
body of the scarecrow in her arms
"and instead of kissing his painted
face, she found she was crying herself
"at this sorrowful parting from
all of her loving comrades."
i'm okay.
"glinda the good
stepped down from her ruby throne
"to give the little
girl a goodbye kiss.
"and dorothy thanked her for
all the kindness she had shown
"to her friends and herself.
"dorothy now took up toto
solemnly in her arms,
"and having said one last goodbye,
"she clapped the heels of her shoes
together three times, saying,
"'take me home to aunt em.
take me home to aunt em.
"'take me home to aunt em."'
what's wrong with him, hunter?

gotta cover him up. come here.
jennifer, come here.
- i'm sorry!

jonathan, come here.
i'm sorry. elizabeth.
he didn't even complain.
- he kept saying he was okay.
- hunter, it's all around us.
it's killing us.
yeah, but if we'd had
more antibiotics...
i used most of them on my shoulder.
- on rob's blast burns...
- hunter, this isn't your fault, okay?
we would all be dead
if you weren't here.
look what happened to
those guys in shenandoah.
hey, man, are you all right?
yeah.
i don't know. you're
looking pretty fucked up.
how are we gonna get
his body out of here?
i mean, there's just more and
more of those people out there.
no, we... we can't
take him outside.
we'll just have to bury him
up in the attic with angie.
no.
i'll take him up.
sorry, rob. you don't have the strength
to carry him. i'm not gonna let you.
no, doc, i...
let me do this.
okay, i owe you. i owe all of you.
if someone's gonna risk
themselves, it should be me.
now, you always...
you've always kept us sensible.
this is the sensible thing.
i mean, look at me. i'm not
gonna last much longer.
it should be me.
how's your ear feeling?
i don't know.
can you, like, hear out
of it or anything?
i can't really feel them.
god, it's bleeding, dude.
rob.
all right.
if there's anybody out there,
put the body down and get
back to the basement.
okay.
here. take this.
no.
you need it down there more.
i'll be all right.
- hey, rob.
- what?
good luck.
you, too.
rob's been out there
a long time, you guys.
he hasn't come back. so...
what do you think? think
those guys got to him?
jonathan, i know
you and rob were close.
i'm sorry.
you think they're in the house?
jesus christ!
why do we still listen
to this shit? what...
what is this guy even
broadcasting about?
why can't he just talk to us?
maybe he's just always
accepted what's happened.
let's face it.
we never had a chance.
- this all was over before we even got here.
- great.
so what are we even doing?
why are we even still here?
why don't we just give up?
i ain't killing myself.
are you psychotic?
'cause that's what we do.
we try to survive.
so that we can go home.
like dorothy and toto.
yeah, like dorothy and toto.
can't sleep either, huh?
i hear them, too.
and they'll, uh...
they'll definitely be
coming down here soon.
yep.
god! why do you think
they've waited so long?
so how's your shoulder?
the arm should probably come off.
yeah, well...
you're doing a lot better than
the rest of us right now.
so, you ready for this?
yep.
we should probably let them
sleep as long as they can.
they're coming.
brad.
i'm gonna go get everyone.
elizabeth, wake up. wake up. get the
guns out. give them to everybody.
oh, shit!
- jonathan, come on.
