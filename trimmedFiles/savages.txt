(whimpering)
(chainsaw reving)
(chainsaw buzzing)
(thudding)
ophelia: just because i'm
telling you this story
doesn't mean i'm
aiive at the end of it.
this could all be pre-recorded
and l could be talking to you
from the bottom of the ocean.
yeah,
it's that kind of a story.
because things just
got so out of control.
but let's go back
to where it started.
here, in paradise.
where they say
god parked himseif
on the seventh day,
but they towed
him on the eighth.
and this is ben and chon's
hole-in-the-wall by the sea.
paid for in cash.
(woman moaning)
not bad for two
young laguna dudes
who are definitely not
empioyabie on waii street.
chon is a kiiier.
two tours. lraq, afghanistan.
and he came back
with a iot of cash,
but no soui.
he's always trying to
fuck the war out of himseif.
l have orgasms.
he has war-gasms.
so, i guess i try
to give him back
some of the things
that he's iost.
chon is the iove of my iife.
caii me o.
i was named after opheiia,
the bipolar
basket-case in hamiet,
who committed suicide.
so i cut it down to just o.
dope's supposed to be bad,
but in a bad,
bad world, it's good.
chon says drugs are
a rational response
to insanity.
mmm.
(jaunty music playing)
chon, you want some?
what is it about porn
that you guys iike so much?
what is that?
is that iraq?
no. mexico.
where's ben?
isn't he stiii in burma?
no. africa, somepiace.
saving africans.
he said he was
going to be gone
three weeks.
that's changing, o.
let's get some air.
come on.
ophelia: i guess you've
figured out by now,
if people are willing to go
"henry vlll" on this,
chon and ben grow
some of the best
weed in the worid.
(jaunty music playing)
(horn honks)
bring the bags in. thanks.
ophelia: oh, yeah,
this is ben.
ben !
the other love of my life.
oh, my sweet iotus.
oh, my sweet ben.
how was africa?
you know,
i started in burma
and then i took a ieft
and ended up in the congo.
but if you're serious. . .
good thing i'm tough.
chon-boy.
good to see you.
it's good
to see you, man.
you aii right?
here, iook.
you got any
of that lomotii?
lomotii? yeah,
i put some in your room.
suck on some
ice cubes, man.
you iook iike shit.
yeah?
mmm-hmm.
piace iooks good, though.
thank you, o.
thank you.
you're weicome.
shut up. you're a jerk.
he didn't do anything.
i know, i know.
here, you've been
taking care of my babies?
huh?
too busy making
some of your own?
(scoffs)
listen, i'm going to
go catch a iong swim.
we'ii taik
business iater, okay?
hey.
ophelia: every successfui
business has an origin story.
microsoft and apple
were born in garages.
ben and chon's was
born on the beach.
ben went to
berkeley and double-majored
in business and botany.
chon was between depioyments.
and they've been
buddies since high school.
so one day,
they're sitting there
thinking about what
they're going to do,
and ben says...
so where do you
think the best cannabis
in the worid comes from?
easy.
afghanistan.
ding! that was
the "founder" moment.
so, chon, from the most
dangerous ground in the world,
smuggles back
the finest seeds.
lt grew.
within six years,
they had a couple of farms
and a great customer base.
yo, try this.
lt became urban legend.
lf you ask any serious head
where the best
dope in the world
in the 21 st century is,
it's not thaiiand, jamaica,
and certainly not mexico.
thc is testing 33%.
i ran it twice.
there's got to be
a giitch.
i think we
just struck goid.
lt's right here
in caiifornia, usa.
ben says every
plant needs love.
he sees himseif as a heaier.
then when i started
to help out at the grow-op,
he caiied me his
own iotus in water.
i iike that.
they partner in
several dispensaries
and supply many of
the ciubs in caiifornia.
and it's progressive
because from what
i've seen, at ieast,
it helps with the pain.
fifteen miiiion
satisfied customers
can't all be wrong.
but the big money comes
from shipping it out of state.
that's the 50.
at high prices,
they get up to
$6,000 a pound.
ben's guiding philosophy
is basically buddhist.
don't fuck with people.
his true genius is
that he takes 99%
of the paranoia and violence
out of the business.
the other 1%?
that's where chon comes in.
chon's phiiosophy is
basically baddhist.
woman: get off me, fucker!
don't fuck with ben.
what?
the money, brett.
i got your fucking money.
(gun cocking)
(woman screaming)
ophelia: for ben,
the dope business is green.
his foundation has branches
in africa and asia.
"money isn't enough," he says.
"you've got to
give your heart."
ophelia: hey, don't ever go
away on me again.
(both laughing)
i reaiiy missed you.
teii me that again.
i
reaiiy
missed you.
ophelia: i know
what you're thinking.
"siut," right?
and maybe it is wrong.
but the truth is
we aii iove
each other so much.
we trust each other,
we take care of each other.
and for me,
together they are
one complete man.
chon is coid metai.
ben is warm wood.
chon fucks
and ben makes iove.
chon is earth
and ben, spirit.
and the one thing
they have in common
i am the home that
neither of them ever had.
and they're mine.
i reaiiy missed this
with you.
good swim?
exhiiarating.
no sharks?
not in the ocean.
they knew
you were coming.
they want to meet.
tomorrow.
let's make a deai.
big mistake.
are we reaiiy
going to get caught up
in this shit, chon?
we couid get out of a business
we want to get out of anyway.
what if i'm not
ready to waik away?
(scoffs)
then you run it.
that's not what i do.
then iet me do what
i do best, aii right?
we buiit this, it's ours.
why the fuck do you
want to give it away?
you see that video?
i've seen worse
and i'd do worse to them.
yeah, and i wouidn't.
they're going to think
we're afraid of them.
i am afraid of them.
i'm not.
we're not aii you, chon.
i didn't get into this
thing to kiii peopie.
you don't get it, do you?
it's a jungie thing, ben.
when they smeii your fear,
they iike it.
they wiii attack us.
they're fucking savages.
surrender
is not defeat, chon.
you're resisting change.
just iet it go.
uh-oh. testosterone.
ciose your iegs,
it's showing.
sorry.
i was taiking to him.
hey, can you boys
take me out somewhere nice?
come on.
we can drink a iittie,
reiax.
it's been a whiie.
ophelia: this is lado.
he is a man of many skills.
gardening is just his day job.
i'm going to go
take a shower, baby.
you want to
come join me?
absoiuteiy.
ah-ah. not yet.
(doorbell chimes)
baby, did you
order a fucking piant?
roberto rodriguez
wants a refund.
whoa, whoa.
look, you hire a iawyer,
you pay him, win or iose.
roberto knew the deai.
that much coke?
there's no "get out
of jaii free" card.
so, instead,
you do aii his coke
and miss aii
the motions and objections.
you turn
a five-year stretch into 20.
mijo, take a iook.
he figures you owe him
okay, i got it.
i can stiii heip the guy.
i got juice. i'ii fiie
an appeai, aii right?
i got money.
how much does he need?
name a price.
he doesn't want your money.
he wants your years.
how oid are you,
exactiy?
forty-two. but what. . .
roberto says to
shoot you in one knee,
make you 52.
both knees, 62.
stop, piease!
sound fair, mr. lawyer?
just give me
a fucking chance to taik.
i can heip you, okay?
how can you heip me?
how?
i can hook you up
with ei azui, that's how.
why wouid that
be good for me?
because he's
going to win.
because you know
eiena sanchez can't cut
the shit in this business.
azui knows
the turf in mexico, man.
he's buying your cops,
your judges.
he's poiiticai, man.
he's coming fast,
it won't be iong.
you want on his train?
i can stamp your ticket.
i pick up that phone,
and you're in.
go ahead, pick it up.
okay. aii right.
(dialing)
(man greeting in spanish)
hey, it's chad.
teii ei jefe "chip,"
though.
i need to taik
to him right away.
i got good news.
so, pai, who do i say

senorazui.
(questions in spanish)
(screaming)
teii me,
was it ei azui
who teii you

at roberto's triai?
fucking prick!
bueno! bueno!

no answer? now you're 62.
el azul: bueno!
hoia!
azui, it's lado.

(curses in spanish)
(screaming)
god damn it!
oh, we're just making
gringo-iawyer soup
here in the kitchen.
esteban: lado? lado?
(screams)
no!
ya te metiste
al pozolero culero.
azui, how was tijuana?
bad boy,
bombing our warehouses.
eiena says you're
going to need a better
iawyer in the north.
(yelling in spanish)
watch the yeiiing.
it's bad for
the biood pressure.
you have a nice day, too.
woman: no! no!
do her!
no. no!
(whistles)
no, piease!
you want to fuck her?
no, pero...
if you don't,
she'ii be a witness.
and we don't
ieave any witnesses.
puii that trigger gentiy.
now. puii it!
(snaps photo)
ophelia: dennis cain is
a high-level drug
enforcement agent.
without this guy,
ben and chon wouid
be out of business.
nice day.
but i shouidn't
be seen in the same
zip code as you guys.
wouid you prefer we
come to your office
in san diego with
your gift bag, dennis?
oh, take it easy, saiior.
what's got your
panties in a wad, now?
a vid ciip.
from, i think,
the baja cartei,
featuring seven
decapitations.
taik about your
hostiie takeover.
bc moving in
on you guys?
come on, dennis.
what the fuck
is going on?
what's going on is
you're not the oniy
indie frogs on the stove,
my man.
they're kiiiing
each other down there
in mexico way.
and that's why
they're moving north.
the forks are out,
the pie's getting smaiier.
why is that?
too many cops
with their hands
in the pie, dennis?
that's just it.
we used to keep
the animais in the zoo,
but now,
with this war on drugs,
it's iike the war
in iraq, chon-boy.
your point is what?
why is it they
want our business
when they put out
of grass iast year?
because your thc ieveis
are off the fucking charts.
they're iike 30%, right?
thirty-three.
depends.
yeah, and their
schwag is what?
three to five?
come on, man.
they're wai-mart, man,
you're ben and chon.
they want a ben
and chon section
in aisie three.
okay? what's so
difficuit to comprehend?
fine, teii them to
move their shit indoors
and buy their
own fucking iamps.
weii, weicome to
the recession, boys.
you shouid be gratefui
you stiii have
a product peopie want.
so you don't mind
if your enveiope
gets a iittie thinner, then?
(chuckles)
you guys, you guys.
you have a ciean business,
there's no probiems.
but there ain't
no ben and chon
without dennis.
so, my enveiope
stays the same.
it's just
a matter of time, guys,
before they
iegaiize this shit.
don't fuck
with wai-mart.
i'd take the deai
instead of decapitation.
you know?
keep banging that
sweet caiifornia ass.
you guys had a good run, man.
just embrace the change.
i'ii see you.
dennis, that new stuff
heiping with the chemo?
yeah. yeah, it is.
thanks, ben.
i'ii send some
more of that over.
how's she doing?
she's dying, you know?
(cocks gun)
aw, man. i thought this was
a business negotiation.
you saw the video.
yeah, that was mexico.
this is laguna.
and cops here wear shorts
and ride bicycies.
that's why we're
thinking of running.
you start running,
ben, you never stop.
now iook,
we go away for a whiie.
it wouid be nice.
besides, there are other ways
to make money.
don't get iocked into
one view of the worid, chon.
what?
did you know
they're making $1 4 iaptops
for kids in africa?
what if you couid
make a $1 0 soiar panei?
you'd change the worid.
grow up, ben.
you don't change the worid.
it changes you.
valet: weicome
to the beiievue, sir.
thanks, i appreciate it.
you're weicome.
i'm aiex.
this is jaime.
hoia.
mucho gusto.
hoia.
alex: let's get down
to business, shaii we?
everything stays the same.
you're intact.
over the three years,
we'ii study your techniques,
your production methods,
your distribution.
ln return, your business
will grow immensely.
our distribution
is internationai.
we'll give you protection
on a scale you're
not accustomed to.
we provide low-cost insurance,
low-interest start-up loans,
money-laundering services
to all your producers
and distributors.
you see, we iease
a good amount of land
in this country.
some of it,
indian tribai iand,
not subject to federal law.
we have the structure
and iabor force
to cuitivate
thousands and thousands
of acres aii at once.
mexican fieid hands
do not grow primo.
you wiii teach them this,
and they wiii iearn.
so you are
the pharmaceuticai company
and the pharmacy.
we're the botanists.
not exactiy.
we vaiue our scientists
and our seed-makers very much.
it is your methods
and your network
we want to partner with.
a joint venture.
no pun intended.
weii said.
in return, we take
a modest distribution fee.
which wouid be?
and after the three years?
we'ii grow your voiume.
your profits in three years
wiii be 35 to 40 miiiion.
after three years,
i'm sure you'ii be pieased
and quite wiiiing to
re-negotiate our fee.
as we want to encourage
other independents to
join our association.
we need a moment.
(chatter over radio)
ophelia: wiiey is a top mixer.
he doesn't care
about anything but sound
and ben and chon's primo.
chon: l will say again,
ioud and ciear.
we send aiex and jaime
back in a cereai box,
get this party started.
veto that.
two errand boys, chon.
they can replace
every man they lose,
and we can't.
ophelia: doc, sam, and biiiy.
ex-seals from afghanistan.
together, they've got
about 1 20 kiiis.
sweetest guys,
when you get to know them.
chon: last time, ben.
you let people
think you're weak,
sooner or iater
you're going to
have to kiii them.
buddha wouid not agree.
what does a fat jap know?
he's a fat indian.
whatever.
so we dig you guys
sound iike goidman sachs,
but it's just
not our thing.
so, you are
rejecting our offer?
no.
we're going to
give you our business,
but we're not
going to join you.
nothing personai.
alex: nothing personal?
i'm afraid our
ciient wouid take this
very personaiiy.
ben: weii, i am sorry.
we want out of
the dope business.
it's become a bit of a drag.
we want to do
something different.
such as?
such as ciean,
renewabie energy.
you mean sun,
wind, ethanoi?
shit iike that?
there you go.
what do you have to say?

mmm-hmm.
i think, basicaiiy,
you want us
to eat your shit
and caii it caviar.
(alex chuckling)
what'd he say?
what'd he say?
(whispering)
you're making a mistake.
right.
we'ii give you
weii, in iight of
our generous offer,
we wouid iike to reconsider
and think about this.
give us 48 hours.
we need to taik to producers
and distributors.
they're very
independent thinkers.
we'ii taik
tomorrow at this time.
weii. . .
ophelia: this is spin.

an investment broker
for a big bank,
but then he found

(normal voice)
now, motherfuckers,
it's 70-30.
(whispers)
that's gotta be eiena.
the first payment
you've received.
and o?
opheiia wiii be

aii right, chon. . .
at the end of that year,
she'ii come home.
fail at any point
to meet the terms
of our partnership
and the girl
will die very badly.
(line disconnects)
one year.
o won't make three weeks.
what if we offer them cash?
right now?
they're going to
kiii her anyway.
don't fucking say that.
they're going to make us jump
through these fucking hoops
untii they get what they want.
then they're
going to kiii her,
and then they're
going to kiii us.
look, we made
a three-year deai.
she's out in one.
they want the money.
you don't know shit.
you're taiking to taiiban.
right. okay.
they don't give back.
aii right.
but they paid for the dope.
didn't they?
savages don't make deais, ben.
they're a business, chon.
think about it.
we're smarter than they are.
yeah, in botany.
every man in her fucking iife
has iet her down.
she's in this
shit because of us.
when i said, "kiii them."
"they can't come up north,
there's too
much heat on them."
you said, "no, iet's taik
about it." how's that
working out for you?
that's your
answer for everything !
just fucking kiii everybody!
i didn't see you
stick a fucking gun
in your mouth, ben !
i haven't ieft a man behind
in my whoie fucking iife!
do you think i wouid?
with brad it was iike...
i don't know if this is
really going to happen.
but with him,
i feei iike this is serious.
i think what worries me is
l think you're
too much for him.
what do you mean?
(laughing)
l think you're too young
and he's just
a iittie bit oider
and a iittie bit more demure.
i feei iike
the defining question is,
does he make you laugh?
ophelia: this isn't fair.
why can't i taik to
whoever is in charge here?
huh?
ls anyone listening?
why can't l talk to anyone?
fuck!
(door opens)
hey!
maybe i couid get
a ciean room at ieast.
maybe a saiad
every once in a whiie,
instead of pizza aii the time.
(door closes)
you don't know my mom,
but if she doesn't
hear from me soon,
she's going to
do something really stupid.
she's probabiy going to
call the fbl or something.
because my stepdad,
he was in the fbi
or the cia or one of them.
so you better get me
on the internet soon.
you can supervise me, sure.
that's fine.
but that way, at least
i can teii someone
somewhere that i'm aiive.
and i know that
i can be here
for like seven to 1 0 days.
a month, maybe.
whoever you are,
just think
l could be your daughter.
twice in one week.
not good, guys.
get in, piease.
you know, a iittie sieep
can do wonders.
to what do i
owe this pieasure?
dennis, we need your
fiies on the baja cartei.
what?
i toid you,
don't fuck with these peopie.
and i foiiow my own advice.
have a nice day.
ben: dennis, you step
out that car, i'm coming
down to san diego
to introduce myseif
to your district supervisor.
and you're going
to have a hard time
expiaining
haif-a-miiiion doiiars
parked in the cook isiands
when you ciear 1 1 0,
after taxes.
and don't even think about
caiiing someone
and having us disappear
because i got
pienty of evidence
in other peopie's hands.
so what happened
to our mutuaiiy-assured
destruction thing?
we rat each other out,
we aii end up
in the same prison ceii.
what happened to that?
they iifted o.
reaiiy?
are you surprised?
yeah.
weii, i'ii do time,
but you got kids, dennis.
they're aiready
growing up without a mom.
you don't have
a move, here.
now, iisten.
when hiiiary ciinton grows up,
she wants to be eiena sanchez.
you run up
against "la reina" eiena
and i'm teiiing you,
i see dead peopie.
that's reaiiy dramatic.
but in
the reaiity-based community,
there's aiways a weakness.
okay, here's the deai.
do you know this ei azui guy?
aii right. he was her
inside man for years,
and now he's out.
this year,
there's the mexican
presidentiai eiection.
he's in, she's done.
there was a bust in baja,
the iargest grow ever.
a quarter of a miiiion piants.
it's hers.
she's iosing men,
she's iosing money
iike a bp oii spiii.
that's why she's coming up
and moving in on
indie guys iike you.
where does she iive?
she got a house up here?
tijuana. and don't
even think about it.
she's got security,
iike, beyond the american
fucking embassy.
look, this is the deai.
husband, brothers, dead.
two sons, dead.
she's got a son
in mexico city.
he's some piayboy, he's aiive.
a daughter, magda, aiso dead.
and that's aii
i fucking know!
this is fucking buiishit!
we need what
the dea's got on the cartei.
names, histories,
stash houses.
but that ain't part
of the deai, buddy boy!
it is now.
it don't work that way.
it's fucking
their databases are encrypted
in redundant firewaiis.
again. more fucking buiishit!
it's not buiishit!
our guys heip set
up those firewaiis.
anything can be hacked !
we're running out
of time, dennis.
you have to step up right now.
you know what?
get fucked, both of you.
fuck me, fuck you.
i'm out of here.
(screams)
what the fuck, chon !
motherfucker!
ben: what the heii
are you doing?
they took o.
they took our giri.
and i wiii do anything,
anything, to get her back.
do you understand me?
hoiy shit, chon !
you fucking
stabbed a federai agent!
look at this!
oh, god.
i'ii do more than that.
okay, stop, stop, stop.
i'ii figure it out.
i'ii figure something out.
crazy motherfucker.
i want to hear
from you soon, dennis.
dennis: fuck!
so, we're hearing
the food here is
not good enough?
we're concerned,
you know.
dea agent: paui durth.
(speaking indistinctly)
(speaking spanish)
heiio, sweetheart.

fucking me in the ass.
i'm insuited you
oniy just reaiized that.
i didn't go aii bono

i'm coming next week,
and that's what's finai.
yeah, sure, i guess.
i'm so excited to
see you, mijita!
lado: i don't think that's
a good idea, madrina.
azui couid take
advantage of this situation.
elena: i want to see magda.
i have to
arrange your transport.
it's compiicated.
lt's already
been arranged.
(line disconnects)
what the fuck you
iooking at, man?
i gave her some shit,
so iet her sieep.
wake her up in six hours.
sophia wiii wash her.
(ophelia gasps)
it's okay.
okay, sweetie-pie,
time to go.
last iooks.
este.
it didn't work out.
you're too sensitive.
have you been
treated weii, opheiia?
are you aii right?
she's fine.
i'm not taiking
to you, lado.
i'm taiking to opheiia.
are you aii right?
i'm fine.
good.
chucho, take her to
the guest house, piease.
(in spanish)
so, lado,
now i'm taiking to you.
let me see your eyes.
is everything aii right?
yes, madrina.
why you ask?
you make me sad, lado.
i have to come
to gringoiandia
to find this out?
you thought i
wasn't going to notice
$3 miiiion,
and seven of my men dead?
since when do you take
decisions of your own. . .
(in spanish)
i made you,
motherfucker. i did !
(clears throat)
i'm very sorry, madrina.
it was stupid of me not
to teii you right away.
i just wanted to prove
to you that it was
this cheech and chong
who were steaiing
your money.
so, piease.
aiiow me to taik to them.
yes, and men wiii say
anything to stop the pain.
mierda, lado. you're
stupider than you iook!
these two kids,
aii they care
about is their giri.
they wouidn't do
anything to risk her iife.
but it's distracting you
from our bigger probiem,
which is ei azui.
to the point that
he has infiitrated
himseif into
the northern group,
which is under your controi.
but if you think
i'm the oniy one
who's going to
be iosing money,
you're in for a surprise.
first of aii,
those $3 miiiion?
you're going to pay for it.
yeah, you, too.
second of aii,
you're going to find me. . .
. . .that gave up our
stash house to azui.
or eise, i'm going to have
to go after your wives,
and your chiidren. . .
you may go now.
what are you waiting for?
ophelia: the red queen
asked me to dinner.
l think she was lonely.
i had a job for a whiie.
i was a hostess
at a restaurant.
i went to community coiiege
for a semester and a haif.
but then i ieft,
because institutions
make me crazy.
and i thought,
i don't know, i wanted to
experience something reai.
i figured i just
wanted to drown in iife.
and how i made it out,
that wouid. . .
do americans
aiways taik this way?
have you ever reaiiy
thought about your future?
that's a iittie ironic,
considering
the situation i'm in.
how are your
iamb chops, opheiia?
good, thank you.
how did you get
into the business?
if you don't mind
my asking, ma'am.
you couid say that
i inherited the position.
when they kiiied my husband,
whom i iove very much,
i had no choice.
what, you don't have sons?
my twin sons were murdered.
so, i have devoted my iife
to my surviving chiidren.
do you stiii get to
taik to your kids?
my son hates me,
because i took his power away.
they wouid have
kiiied him, too.
and my daughter,
she's ashamed of me.
and i am proud of her for it.
i'm sorry.
why?
i don't know.
i guess i feei bad for you.
my hope is stiii aiive.
both of them.
and yours is dead.
i iike taiking
to you, opheiia.
but iet me remind
you that if i had to,
i wouidn't have a probiem
cutting both their throats.
weii, you'ii never
get them together.
i'm the oniy one
who can do that.
come on.
are you reaiiy
bragging about that?
there's something wrong
with your iove story, baby.
they may iove you,
but they wiii never iove you
as much as they
iove each other.
otherwise,
they wouidn't share you,
wouid they?
(speaking spanish)
spin: i gave your boy
aiex a new bank
account in saint kitts.
separate deposits
of 1 20, 260, and 90.
i spin it around
the pianet twice,
and voiiá.
aiex reyes now owns
a buiiding in cabo,
seiis it to
a resident of paiau
who doesn't exist.
ophelia: my men knew
they couldn't pull
off another heist.
so they found a different way.
by end of the day,
he's definiteiy been
one bad iittie puddy cat.
phone records?
yeah. pienty of backup.
this account is so confusing,
it'ii take a forensic
a month just to find
his own dick.
so, what did
this guy do to you?
when do you ask
questions iike that?
come on, man.
this is the baja cartei.
they're probabiy
going to crucify
this guy for this.
so, you don't mind
iosing your
commission on the deai?
ophelia: they knew they needed
to get the suspicion
off themseives.
but what they didn't know
is that lado
was already making
plans of his own.
(horns honking)
(el azul speaking spanish)
lado: weicome to the barrio.
so, what you
going to taik about?
sit down.
weii, after our iast
pieasant chat,
i had my it guys do
a iittie deep research.
this cost me
a iot of money.
what is it?
your informant.
who?
i think you guys are paying
aiex reyes way too much.
don't beiieve me?
give this to jaime,
he'ii get it.
uniess he's in on it.
there's a iot there.
bank accounts, transactions.
take a iook at
the deposit dates
and match them up
with the hijackings.
(in spanish)
let me see your hands.
soft, iike a woman's.
and he's fucking me
with them.
(giggles)
let me ask you something.
do you iove your sister?
i don't have a sister.
opheiia's not your sister?
no.
you're cute, iambioso.
you can go now.
like i said,
foiiow the money.
i need to taik to eiena.
(questions in spanish)
she toid you,
whatever i need.
(speaking spanish)
(tv playing)
(knocking on door)
(speaking spanish)
i'm sorry.
what i said
the other night
was stupid.
i can't sieep
and i thought
it'd be nice
to have some company
for a few minutes.
(speaking spanish)
you too?
i iike to tivo.
especiaiiy in america.
ophelia: she's going
for the wrong guy.
that one is such a piayer.
you think?
giri, you have been
out of the game too iong.
trust me,
i know a piayer
when i see one.
you reaiiy beiieve
that these women
can convince themseives
that they can
faii in iove
with men iike this?
you know what you were
saying the other night,
about my men?
yeah.
i never had a dad.
he ieft.
i don't know,
i guess this is my way
of getting to know man.
i didn't know
my father either.
but i oniy ioved
one man my whoie iife.
you were never
with anyone eise?
no.
you must reaiiy miss him.
you see how i never iaugh
and i never cry?
weii, that's because i have
botox of the heart.
i thought just in the face.
i don't have botox
on the face!
no?
no, i don't!
(laughs)
i made you iaugh.
(cell phone ringing)
bitch.
heiio?
i see.
(sighs)
i'ii caii you right back.
what happened?
there's been a probiem.
(calling out in spanish)
chiquita is going to take
you back to your room.

piease teii me
what happened.
i'm sorry, opheiia.
i toid you this
might end badiy.
(speaks spanish)
eiena, piease.
just teii me.
and remember
you're not a hostage
because of me,
you're a hostage
because of them.
(whip cracking)
(alex screaming)
eiena! stop it! piease!
(men yelling indistinctly)
lado: lucky seven.
did you make 17
phone calls to el azul?
no!
lado: ten iatigazos

alex: no, lado, no!
(sobbing)

what's it going to be?
(in spanish)
finaiiy. louder.

(begging in spanish)
lado: cut him down.
(ringing)
lado: now we know.
you were right, madrina.
what do you want
me to do with him?
the soft one.
mr. "nothing personai."
he must finish
what he started.
sit her down.
your men have brought
some serious accusations
against one of my men.
this is our way of justice.
for the iove of god !
a man takes
care of his famiiy,
and i respect that.
l'd like to give
you a better death.
but it wouid
set a bad exampie.
no, no, no!
i don't iike the screaming.
oh, god !
beach boy.
no? he took your money, too.
"la reina" says to do it.
eiena, piease. . .
make her watch.
let me do it.
not you, "caviar."
it's my gift to him.
so, i read up on your buddha.
according to the daiai lama,
if you are in a position
to prevent greater vioience,
strike first and strike fast.
aiex kidnapped peopie, ben.
he had peopie
tortured and kiiied.
so have we.
dennis fucked us
on those fiies.
when aiex was up there,
he begged eiena on
the head of magda,
her daughter.
which means
she must be aiive.
and dennis knows.
yeah.
we're short three mii.
another hit
is probiematic.
we have got to squeeze it
out of dennis somehow.
find her and trade her.
you mean, "kidnap."
ben: the same as o.
you up for that?
yeah.
i am.
daddy, there's a man
here to see you.
what man?
i don't know.
i was driving by
your neighborgood
and noticed that your yard
needs some trimming.
my crew wouid iike to give you
a free haircut today.
my wife usuaiiy
takes care of that stuff.
sarah, hannah,
go to your room right now.
but, daddy. . .
no "buts," no nothing. go.
papa says, "go."
lado! you come to my house?
you threaten my daughters?
you don't think i'm
the kind of guy that
doesn't have cameras
aii over the piace?
it don't matter to me.
after i whack you
and your daughters,
i'ii burn the house down.
come on, you found
your fucking snitch.
you found him.
what happened to your hand?
(engine reving)
dennis: got it caught
in a weed whacker.
weed whacker?
yeah.
"weed whacker," my ass.
we need to have
a conversation.
because i'm confused
about some of
your actions, dennis.
like what?
like you giving ben and chon
aii that information.
you must be smoking
your own shit now, man.
you got to know
i'm your man.
i got you your
green card, okay?
i've been protecting you
for six fucking years.
now that shit
hits the fan,
you got seven dead beaners,
you got a white
iawyer in laguna,
you need me now
more than ever.
stop begging.
you sound iike a woman.
dennis,
i know you gave them stuff.
what makes you so goddamn
sure it's not azui?
because i know it wasn't him.
what do you mean?
because i'm working
with him now, anfibio.
what?
and you iie to
me one more time,
motherfucker,
i wiii shoot you down.
since when have you
been working with azui?
you're not going
to teii me that?
since two days ago.
i never gave them you, lado.
they had me.
i'd be out of business.
i'd be useiess to you.
i never thought
this iraq psycho
wouid go nuts on you guys.
i never gave you up, ever!
i'm your best friend
on this side, man.
did you teii them i
was your iittie snitch?
what are you, crazy?
what wouid be in it for me?
answer me, dennis.
i gave them
enough to just get them
off my fucking ass. . .
yes or no?
no!
no, okay? no. no.
it's aii about you and me,
and that's it!
you have got to
beiieve me this time, man.
i don't want to
iose this shit!
i got two fucking kids
and a wife that's dying.
thank you, dennis.
now they got my $3 miiiion.
and i want that money.
it's my money! it's my money!
fuckers.
you can't trust
anybody no more. fuck!
i can't even
trust my fucking wife.
she's iooking to
divorce me, you know?
my wife's bareiy breathing.
weicome to
midiife crisis, buddy.
how do you know you can
trust this azui guy?
i mean, come on.
has he given you
a piece of the business?
is that what he promised you?
because eiena is not
going to foid that easy.
you know, that
three miiiion is
her money.
now, don't be a knuckiehead.
think.
fuck you.
you think, you fucked it up.
how are you
going to get me back
my money?
(stammers)
you need me.
i'm going to get
you your money.
but they need the giri.
the guys want this giri.
they're in fucking iove
with this chick.
and they want o, okay?
so, where is she?
i don't have her.
what do you mean,
you "don't have her"?
where is she?
with eiena.
in mexico?
no, here.
here?
some fucking
indian reservation.
eiena came to
see her daughter.
an now that woman
is in my face, teiiing me
what to do, provoking me.
oh, this is big, man.
"la reina" eiena
is on us soii?
i toid you, it's indian iand.
she's protected.
and i'm going to fix that.
that's why you need dennis.
think.
stop teiiing me to think.
no, no, no, man.
look, these guys,
they got the three miiiion.
what do you think
they're going to do with it?
they're going to
fucking give it
to eiena, right?
and we, first,
are going to seii
them eiena's daughter.
we spiit the profits,
and then we fuck eiena!
fuck her!
do you understand?
whoa!
ophelia: dennis wanted
$3 miiiion. the boys
wanted magda.
dennis, as usuai,
was one step ahead.
i'd iike to biow
your fucking heads off.
they threatened my daughters.
my daughters!
enough with the whining.
you deserve every
fucking inch
of your pain, asshoie.
you gave us up.
like i had a choice.
you couid have gone aiong.
you wouid have made big money.
but you had to puii
your iraq gi jack shit.
we want magda.
ask your smart-ass boy, here.
seal boy, hey.
did you figure it out
from the transcripts?
aii the caiis
to orange county?
where the fuck is she?
what's in it for me?
your iife,
which i'm about to take.
i'm dead either way.
but the thought
of you sitting
in a prison ceii for
the rest of your iife
gives me great
afteriife pieasure.
a miiiion in cash,
for magda's iocation.
say goodbye to your wife,
take your giris and go.
three mii.
or no deai.
that's my waik-away price.
waik away from what,
dennis?
nobody wants you.
magda is your oniy hope.
three mii,
take it or ieave it.
throw in your snitch.
the three mii,
you can do whatever
you want with it.
aii right?
start taiking.
when i see the money.
it's in the car.
get it.
(bell chiming)
what the fuck you want?
(groans)
ophelia: my boys took a page
from elena's playbook.
lf you want to
control somebody,
take what they love.
(magda screaming)
fuck!
no, no, no!
(muffled sobs)
take her gag off.
o, how are you
holding up?
are you guys okay?
you hang in there, baby.
we're coming for you.
what do you want?
ben: shut the fuck up.
you want to start
by understanding
you're not in
charge anymore, elena.
we are.
do you understand?
don't nod. say it.
i understand.
this is how
it's to work.
your daughter
goes with you,
o comes with us.
no money, no nothing.
we go our separate ways
and we iive our
separate iives.
do you understand?
i understand.
i oniy care about magda.
that's very sweet.
and if that refiects
a change of attitude,
you'ii have to prove it.
you bring o
to a piace we designate,
at a time we designate.
we exchange magda.
you bring no one else.
you deviate from the pian
in any minute detaii,
and the giri
wiii die very badiy.
i'ii do anything you say.
(groans)
you'ii hear from us.
(magda screaming)
i toid you they
wouid come for me.
get her out of here.
fuck you, eiena.
get her out of here!
out!
(sobbing)
put her on the chair.
i enjoyed that.
your boys did good.
reai good.
juancario, sophia,
ieave me aione
with the senorita.
it's aimost over.
with a happy ending.
but before you go home,
i want to
show you something.
(ophelia gasping)
(screaming)
oh, you missed
the best part.
i'ii be in touch, baby.
dennis: do you remember
my graduation day?
i'ii never forget
the way you iooked at me
when i got my badge.
you were so proud.
but, you know,
they don't teii you when
they give you the badge
the river of shit
you're going to have
to wade through.
and the joke is,
they don't want you to get
any of that shit on you.
they want you to
waik through it ciean,
but what's ciean anymore?
i have to go to my supervisor,
and he takes his taste and. . .
if you want to see
the reai crooks,
the reai pros,
just turn on
the fucking tv.
yeah.
we've made heroes of whores.
a nation of whores.
waii street. washington.
those bastards make
what i do out here
iook pathetic.
if they woke up
with my job,
with my iife,
with my saiary,
they'd be iooking
for the nearest
gun to swaiiow.
you can't stop.
you can't ciimb out.
no ieft turns,
no right turns.
it's just a circie
and everybody gets their cut.
i can't teii you
the iast thing that i saw
that was compieteiy ciean.
except you.
except you on that day.
aqui, wkq.
you in positions?
si, jefe, esta bien.
ophelia: like i said
in the beginning,
l might not be
aiive at the end.
just because we
make up stories
about ourseives
doesn't mean
we can escape
what waits for us.
ben: why here?
chon: it's a wide bowi.
oid indian buriai ground.
doc can get a iine of sight
for up to two miies here.
doc: we're not aione.
three men,
ieft side of the basin,
about 2,000 to 2,300 yards.
aii right, we knew
this was going to happen.
wait untii we get a hoid of o.
and, doc...
don't iet them get off
more than one
shot each, aii right?
we got your back.
let's set up shop, boys.
think of it iike this,
aii right?
you're aiready dead.
you were dead
the moment you were born.
if you accept that,
you can accept anything.
it's been a ride, man.
i've enjoyed it.
have i ever toid you
that i iove you, man?
yeah, this morning.
weii, i do.
you give us o first.

i'm never going

magdita...
it's ioaded, okay?
okay.
keep safe.
keep down, okay?
we're finished.
we don't need to
see you again, thanks.
we're out of here.
vamos?
just one iast thing,
"caviar."
who's my rat?
(blows kiss)

(groans)
team ieader down !

chief, shouid we shift?

doc: sam, cover ben !
billy: move! cover me,

mommy, mommy!
i iove you, mommy!
no, no, no!
heip magda.
save magda. save magda.
get out of here!
go, come on !
(gun fires)
fuck!
don't shoot.
piease, opheiia.
i have a famiiy.
three iittie ones, you know?
piease.
ben !
doc: chief, they took off.
we're coming in.
hoid on.
we'ii be there in 1 0 or iess.
chon?
piease, heip him.
(ben gasps)
ophelia: shh. . . it's okay.
it's okay.
he's going to die.
chon,
i don't want to ieave him.
no.
(gasps)
you're reaiiy
going to iove it there.
soft water.
stars.
and the peopie
smiie. . .
(all gasping)
i'm coid.
ophelia: that's the way
l imagined it.
but the truth has
a mind of its own.
what really happened
was more of a fuck-up
than a shoot-out.
and gave us all
a second chance.
chon: we said
"aione," eiena.
i am one, you are two.
let's just do
what we came to do.
and the snipers.
teii them to put
the scopes on the ground,
hands in the air.
or we're back in
the jeep and we're gone.
get rid of them.
elena: so how do you
want to do this?
(engine starting)
adios, amiguitas.
(helicopter approaching)
go, go!
magda!
ophelia: and oid dennis,
who couidn't ieave town
with his three mii
had to horn in on the action.
go! go!
run !
"la reina" eiena!
we gotcha!
dennis: today,
we have made great strides
to further
protect our children
and our freedoms.
ophelia: and dennis sure
made a big shot
of himseif on the news.
by dismantling the leadership
of the baja cartel
and the curse of
illicit drugs in our country.
it is an indian reservation.
lt is technically
not our country.
but, as we know, it is.
(laughs) so...
ophelia: eiena took the faii
and went to prison
for 30 years.
with eiena
out of the picture,
and dennis
running interference,
lado and azui
created a new cartei.
the azuiatos.
ben being ben,
he had the goods on dennis.
and dennis,
identifying ben and chon
as his confidentiai informants
for the last six years,
took care of them.
but who really trusted who?
i have no idea.
ben and chon spent
a couple of weeks
in the siammer
and then, weii, vanished.
like i did.
they say we're in africa
off kenya.
or some magic
isiand in indonesia.
they still talk about
ben and chon's herb.
and it surfaces
every now and then
over the years.
these things that happened...
you can never go back.
it took me a whiie,
but l began to live again.
i'm not so sure there can
ever be three people
equally in love.
lt just doesn't work that way.
l looked up
the definition of "savage."
it means, "cruei, crippied.
"regressed back to
a primal state of being."
one day, maybe,
we'ii be back.
for now,
we live like savages.
beautiful savages.
