man: before my father died,
he said the worst thing about growing old
was that other men stopped
seeing you as dangerous.
i've always remembered that, how being
dangerous was sacred, a badge of honor.
you live your life by a code, an ethos.
every man does. it's your shoreline.
it's what guides you home.
and, trust me,
you 're always trying to get home.
man over radio: authorities say
the ring is centered in costa rica,
with the primary export being...
man over radio:...widely unknown if
the war on drugs is connecting them...
man over radio:...in the region
have been known to retaliate using a...
man over radio:
...25,000 troops...
man over radio:
...flying from the us to control that...
can we get some ice cream?.
- no, we gotta go.
- you always say no.
- well, are you gonna buy?.
- no, you buy.
ok, what are
we getting today?
- passion fruit.
- ok, passion fruit.
man: how about macadamia nut?.
woman over radio:
...claimed responsibility for the attack
at the international school in manila.
man: your father was a reader.
churchill, of course, but also faulkner
and books about tecumseh.
he loved artists who painted people
with bodies that looked like boxes.
i'd give him hell about that.
he 'd just say,
"you gotta look harder. "
ambassador margullies had long
been a strong supporter
of joint counterterrorism operations
conducted within this region.
not one group has yet claimed responsibility
for the attacks on the international school.
- here's your coffee, rorke.
- thank you, ma'am.
- how's it going?.
- hey, you want the usual?.
- sounds good, thank you.
- you're late again, dave.
i didn't say anything.
what do you got
going on over here?.
- are you serious, man?.
- we're not telling anyone yet.
you a little nervous, though, huh?.
last time i checked,
they don't come with directions.
yeah, tell me about it.
- hey.
- hey.
my man here is having a baby.
hey, congratulations.
hey, everybody,
rorke's having a baby.
woman: congratulations, rorke!
whoo!
- what did i just say?.
- ah, don't worry about it, man.
you're gonna be awesome. i'm so excited
for you, man. you're gonna be a good dad.
hey, tomorrow jackie and i
are heading down to the beach.
bring sandy and the kids.
i'll bring an extra board for you.
- you know i don't surf.
- i know you don't surf, but it'll be good
- to get the families together.
- all right.
but now that you've told everyone in the bar,
try and contain yourself tomorrow.
i will try.
dave: "look harder, "
your father would say.
i always knew he wasn't just talking
about those boxy abstract paintings.
there's threats everywhere,
and the world is draped in camouflage.
christo: huh?.
hey, i'll be right down, all right?.
whatever you say, boss.
woman: how was the ride?.
man: i left colombia this morning.
- colombia to here in one day?.
- piece of cake.
anyway, estimates say
that christo is worth
- close to a billion.
- that's with a "b"?.
yeah, and he gives back a lot
to this community over here
with medical clinics,
schools, political donations,
you name it, so this is the deal:
they are extremely
loyal to him over here.
when did the dea hand him over to us?.
when they intercepted a 707 of his
filled with soviet weapons.
listen, langley says that
the boys over at nsa,
they found some interesting
intercepts connecting christo
to a jihadist network
out of southeast asia.
apparently, christo and one
of the guys running the network,
they're childhood friends.
dave: your father's
grandfather gave up his life
flying a b-24 in world war ii.
he kept the liberator aloft
just long enough for everyone to jump,
and then he went down
with the plane.
that's the blood
that courses in your veins.
- daddy, can i come with you?.
- you want to come with me?.
did you feel how cold it is out there?.
i'll tell you what,
go hang out with mommy for a little while,
help out with the baby.
when i come back in, if you still want
to go out, i'll take you out with me.
- promise?.
- i promise. hurry up, go.
- what's going on, sir?.
- what's up, brother?.
- nothing much, man.
- now, i know you got the new york heritage,
but this isn't exactly like
sitting back in staten island.
you got to actually work hard
to get through the surf.
- yeah, i know.
- twelve-plus years on the teams,
and you don't know
how to do this?.
hey, wait till you
have five kids, man.
you'll see how much time
you got to play in the surf.
you ready to get
in the drink or what?.
all right, man, lead the way.
- all right, don't embarrass us.
- all right.
dave: your father was my boss,
and i was his chief.
what we knew about each other
strengthened our bond as operators.
there was a brotherhood between us,
and we depended on each other
more than a family.
tecumseh said,
"although a single twig will break,
a bundle of twigs is strong. "
ok, ok, gracias.
w ow, this is unbelievable.
i still can't believe you
ordered chinese in this place.
it's really good.
double word score,
- "dumb"?.
- read it and weep, sugar.
i'll try not to.
look at this, look at this.
thirty-eight points for me.
"adumbrating,"
that's not even a word.
ok, first of all,
it's pronounced "adumbrating,"
and it means pretending,
foreshadowing.
hm...
guess who's buying dinner
tonight, sugar.
fine.
in most cases,
officers get tactical partners.
langley sets me up
with some sort of scrabble hustler.
woman: scrabble yoda, ok?.
get it right.
- how much do i owe you?.
- nada.
shit.
dave: our platoon
was headed downrange.
we had weimy, our sniper.
he grew up in the middle
of the mojave desert.
most excitement he found
as a kid was bowling frozen turkeys
down the aisle at the grocery store.
ray, our comms guy, our radioman,
he grew up in east la gangland.
he had a silver star for pulling
a wounded teammate out of the fray.
sonny, he was made of granite.
this guy didn 't even do push-ups
'cause he was afraid his chest
was gonna get too big.
ajay joined the teams
late in his 30s.
he 'd been a muay thai fighter
early in life.
before that, he grew up
dirt-poor in trinidad.
mikey had 20 years in the teams.
but as humble as he was,
you 'd never even know it.
he kept a picture of his wife in his helmet
and a lock of her hair in his pocket.
quiet as the breeze.
and finally, senior chief.
i couldn 't really
tell you much about him...
... other than i'd rather
take a knife into a gunfight
than have to be interrogated by him.
that last night at home,
you think about how you could
have been a better dad,
a better husband.
that bedtime story you should have read
or that anniversary you forgot.
you don 't expect your family
to understand what you 're doing,
you just hope they'll accept it.
when you get home, you hope you
can pick up right where you left off.
what up?.
- you putti ng the wild bunch down?.
- y eah, yeah.
hey, senior, you mind giving
us a couple minutes, man?.
- nah, you got 'em, jefe.
- thanks.
hey, fellas, you know
i only got so many speeches
in a given work-up or deployment, but, uh...
...it's like chief and i said right
at the beginning of this platoon:
once we step off on campaign, once this
bird's ready and we're downrange,
everything back home
needs to be in balance.
we're not gonna be worth a damn
to each other or ourselves
if we get over there
and something's out of whack.
i mean, if things
aren't right with the family,
things aren 't right with the finances
or something's off,
it's gonna put us all out of balance, so we
need to have that tight before we launch.
if somebody's got an issue,
bring it up.
chief can take care of it, i can take care
of it. everybody's got each other's back.
let's make sure we lock that down
so when we 're ready to roll,
all our focus is on the mission.
da ve: for all those
who have been downrange,
to us and those like us,
damn few.
- cheers.
- hear, hear.
i still like the name james.
i'll think about it,
if it's a boy.
come here.
- i'm proud of you.
- thanks, baby.
hey, little one, you make sure
you keep mama away from aunt carol.
i don't like that
chain-smoking at all.
i got it, lieutenant.
- ok.
- it's gonna be ok.
- all right.
- it's gonna be fine.
try to keep this as long
as you can for a while, yeah?.
anything else, commander?
yeah. i'd like to be able to look into
your eyes when our first child is born.
you know i'll do my best.
i love you, baby.
love you.
dave: war is a country of will.
there's no room for sympathy.
if you're not willing to give up everything,
you've already lost.
man: tell me, what is it
about you americans that makes
you feel entitled to fuck
with the way i make my living?
i know who you are, miss morales,
and i know who you work for.
so why don't you
save us both some time
and tell me exactly
what you think you know?
christo: how did that feel,
miss morales?
have a great day at the spa.
man on phone: s?, jefe.
- hey, fellas, what's up?.
- hey.
it's hotter than two rats screwing
in a wool sock out there, yeah?.
africa-hot...
tarzan couldn't take this heat.
anyway, here's the deal.
time to get your frogman on.
lights. three days ago,
two cia agents, a walter ross
and a miss lisa morales,
were ambushed inside their
hotel room here in costa rica
by a unknown amount
of heavily armed assholes.
unfortunately, mr. ross was murdered,
and miss morales has been abducted.
we believe that this has been the work
of a guy named mikhail troykavitch,
aka christo.
lt's going to give you
the skinny on him.
thanks, senior.
mikhail troykavitch, aka christo.
this guy is believed to have been
working cocaine-for-weapons deals
between the russian mafia, the farc
guerrillas, and the mexican drug cartels
ever since the late 1 990s.
now, before she was captured,
morales was working a possible link
between our boy christo
and this guy abu shabal.
glory to allah,
lord of the worlds,
who has created us as muslims
and delivered us with the jihad
on his direct path.
peace be upon those who follow his
direct path till the day of judgment.
let me explain this to you americans.
we are not separatists.
we chechens are not
a legal part of anyone,
but you americans are willingly
or unwillingly assisting
in the genocide of our people
by demanding that we obey certain rules,
and by your continued
occupation of all muslim countries.
with the grace of allah,
glorious and exalted is he,
america will never be safe
until safety becomes a reality for us.
allahu akbar.
lt: abu shabal is
a chechen terrorist
who's associated with
the beslan school massacre.
he's been jumping between training camps
in indonesia and the philippines.
now, the connection between christo
and abu shabal is still a little bit fuzzy,
but if this was the lead
that morales was working on,
it could be why
she was abducted. senior?.
all right, this is a personnel
recovery of miss morales.
all right, who's got questions?
senior chief, you got
any updated source intel
on numbers inside the camp,
and what about roving patrols?.
maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't
know anything about roving patrols.
you're just gonna have to assume
that they're out there
walking around, squared away.
they do this for a living, too.
senior, what kind of weapons-on-target
are we looking at?.
heavy weapons.
these guys are narco-traffickers,
so they can have anything
from soviet-bloc dshks.
they could have m2hp,
.50-cals out there, we don't know.
so if there is a weapons' emplacement up
there, i suggest you guys bring rockets.
of course, rockets and foliage don't match,
so make sure you got a clear shot.
- all right, what else?.
- any idea whether she's ambulatory or not?.
there was a ton of blood on the scene,
and a lot of it was mr. ross',
we confirmed that.
miss morales may have bled there, too,
but these guys are savages,
so you're gonna have to assume
that she is non-ambulatory,
so you're gonna have
to bring stuff to carry her out.
man over pa:
two minutes to drop.
hey, lt.
you got to let us know who that guy is,
so when we get back, we can kick his ass.
what guy?.
the guy that gave you
that fucked-up haircut.
- fuck.
- ajay: damn, sonny,
you should be the last guy to talk.
you look like the dominican mr. clean.
sonny: that means my head
shines like your gold teeth, huh?.
don't be like that,
- that's harsh.
- ramp!
mask up.
man, i tell you what. the only thing better
than this right here is being a dad,
except for that whole
changing diaper thing, but...
...sandy does that for me anyway, so...
i'm actually looking forward to it.

you took one to the face, man.
you're a hard motherfucker.
- did we get her?.
- yes.
- oh, my god.
- we're on our way to extract.
ajay, splash it. splash it.
water! water! water!
going in! going in!
i got her! i got her!
it's fucking going under.
out! get the fuck out!
echoing: it wasn't for nothing.
you know, from time to time,
i get to see my old friends
from my old life.
and it's always, always disappointing.
some become assholes,
other boring,
and i can't believe i tried to get them
in bed all those years ago.
hey.
it is nice not to be disappointed, yuri.
- that's not my name.
- i know.
mohammed abu shabal,
the son of shabal.
come on.
your father's name is yevgeny.
things change.
yeah, things have changed.
that's why this is the last time we might
have to see each other for quite some time.
for i might have
to find a hole to hide in.
i don't understand.
i'm being watched by the cia,
and i'm not taking any chances.
as soon as the opportunity presents itself,
i'm taking my family south.
i neither have the energy or the will
to fight the americans.
what about our deal, mikhail?.
my men have been training
for almost a year now.
- i have devoted much of my resources...
- the deal stands, yuri.
just because i've taken
early retirement does not mean
i'm not holding up
my end of the bargain.
there is so much to be done.
and it will be, just without me.
you'll have to use
my trusted associates.
that's not so good for me.
- hey...
- hey! shut up!
shut up!
stop your fucking bullshit!
it's not good. doesn't work.
you can't change it like that.
- nothing changes. nothing.
- you just told me everything's changed.
what... what is that?.
what is that?.
do you know what i do to get here?.!
do you know the men who i've
had to sacrifice to get here?.!
do you have any idea?.!
no, you shit! you live up here
in this ivory tower!
you have no... you don't care!
hey, chief, what's the status on mikey?.
he's definitely gonna lose the eye,
but he's... he's hanging tough.
hey, i'm gonna get right into this.
great job smoke-checking those
assholes and getting morales back.
it's a bum deal for mikey, but i gotta
tell you what, that was solid work.
so, chief, you make sure you get
that down to the boys right away.
- you hear me?.
- check.
all right. now, morales,
morales was one tough chick,
but she should've gotten
the stuff up the chain a lot faster
because this thing is way
bigger than we thought it was.
how is that?. i thought this was
a cut-and-dry amcit recovery.
yeah, it was until we got into that phone
that you guys picked up in that shithole.
it turned me on to something
that just does not look right at all.
- and what's not right about it?.
- christo and shabal are a lot closer
than i thought they were,
and shabal is a wild card, man.
he is an old-school jihadi that couldn't
give a rat's ass about money or drugs.
yeah, and his childhood friend,
christo, the dope dealer?.
he is not a dealer, man.
he's a smuggler.
- you have got to be kidding me.
- that is exactly what i'm thinking.
shabal wants to kill americans.
christo knows how to get
fuckers inside america.
this could be big trouble
in little china, fellas.
they're gonna hit us at home.
i just got done talking to the boss
and the spec ops task force,
and this is what's gonna go down.
i need ajay and ray standing by
to launch for an sr in two hours.
they're gonna get some
frequent flyer miles on the way to africa.
why africa?.
we pinned an airfield there
with that phone that you got,
and i think that shabal is gonna be there
doing a weapons transfer on his way west.
when you say "west," what are
we talking about, mexico west?
yeah, mexico west.
that's worst-case scenario.
you two and the rest of the platoon
are gonna stay here on standby.
you'll be the primary assault force in case
something goes down anywhere near america.
- check.
- check.
you gonna be around for
any questions as they come up?.
no, man. christo... he pulled a roman
polanski on my ass and disappeared.
so i'm gonna link up
with seal team four,
and we're gonna go hunt his ass
down in the south pacific.
so it's straight up mai tais
and palm trees for me, baby.
yeah, brother. go get him.
- you be cool.
- take it easy.
good luck with that baby, lieutenant.
- does everybody know?.
- only the important people.
the important people to who?. you?.
i guess so.
- i'm gonna go brief the boys.
- hey, hold on one second.
hey, brother, i've never
written one of these before.
hey, i'm tracking with you, sir. i am.
but, to be honest with you,
i was thinking of calling the command
and trying to get you home.
but now that work's picked up so much,
i feel like we really need you here.
you remember our
last cruise to al anbar?.
- yeah.
- when you had that final
turnover op, and you said
i didn't need to be there?.
i was laying in bed and i realized the only
thing i needed to do now was go home.
but if something went south on your op,
i would always regret
not being there with you.
i appreciate you taking care
of me big-time, dave,
but i'm working some things
with the brass.
if i can, and things slow down,
i'm gonna get two weeks off.
well, i hope it works out
either way. i really do.
but, if it doesn't,
i'm gonna take this piece of paper,
and i'm gonna make it
into a nice paper airplane.
beat it.
we're good, we're good!
man: chief of the watch,
submerge the ship to one-six-zero feet.
dive. dive.
over radio: scope down.
all doors are green.
- oh, good. hey, guys.
- sir.
- thank you for getting here so fast.
- sure.
- grab a seat, please.
- thank you.
you'll have bulldog overhead.
we need you to get in,
grab the intel
and bounce it back to us.
do you have any questions?.
sir, i have a question.
we have the rally point and time.
what if the meeting
doesn't take place as scheduled?.
how long do you
want us to stay on target?
now, this one counts, so i'd plan
on being out there for a while.
- check.
- are we good?.
- think so, sir.
- yes, sir.
man: ray and ajay are rigged up
and ready to check each other out.
over radio: garage door clear.
- you got a visual?.
- yeah.
got three trucks moving in.
a fuel truck, two jeeps,
some skinnies in the back.
one of them has a.50-cal.
you hear that?.
- yeah, i think that's our plane.
- yeah, we got some inbound.
'bout time these guys showed up.
jesus. let me get my camera.
hey, ray, we got two birds
down at the end of the field,
southeast our pos, no tail ids.
- you got that?.
- check, no tail ids.
ray, last time i checked,
we were in africa, right?
yeah. why, what's up?.
dude, there's, like,
all praying to mecca right now.

like, a one-time deal, man.
after 9/1 1, my uncle sent
a bunch out for the platoon,
but, uh, after this go-round,
i'll give it to you.
no, no, i'm not gonna
take your family crest.
all right, good.
i didn't want to give it to you anyway.
besides, man,
i'm pretty sure i saw you
putting something in your
cargo pocket the other day.
- what's that?.
- i know i've seen you carrying
something in that pocket right there.
what is it?.
that's my grandfather's flag.
- nice.
- my pop gave it to me,
and now i'm gonna
give it to my boy someday.
all right. i like that.
you're sitting on a wonderful boat.
- it's fabulous.
- thank you. yes.
- i believe it's called starship.
- "starship. "
i love the way you say starship.
it's like russian.

oh, no, he was, sorry, scott.
- i wouldn't know.
- yes. you've never seen star trek?.
- no.
- oh, that's insane.
- so here's the problem, pal.

let me tell you
how the world really works.
- please.
- this is no longer your boat.
since i walked through that door,
you're not the same guy you used to be.
you're just not.
there's nothing i can do to stop that,
nothing i can do to help you right now,
unless you let me help you.
we need to do this together, pal.
you and me.
so how is it that you're working
with these jihadi folks, then?
you're jewish, right?.
shabal is what?.
- you got a friend, like, you grew up with?.
- sorry?.
have you ever had a friend
that you grew up with?.
- yes.
- had, like, played interests, played soccer,
or... what would you play?.
baseball, probably, right?.
- probably. yeah.
- yeah.
and then you went
on your separate ways,
and then some years later,
you meet up.
and you totally
didn't recognize the person.
and that's what happened with shabal.
we share a common interest.
so he came up with this incredible idea
because of his beliefs.
i don't necessarily share his beliefs,
but he's a smart guy.
you know, it's almost like...
...you know, it's almost like...
...iike this is me.
- and that's shabal.
- is it?.
- and america is in-between.
- is it?.
yeah.
cool concept, no?.
- right here?.
- yes.
you think this is some kind of game?.
- do you?. do you find this amusing?.
- no. no.
- i'm not finding...
- do you realize what you're doing here?.
man over radio: blackbeard actual,
this is blackbeard main.
post nation counterpart.

- yes, i do.
- and what about your daughter?.
what about my daughter?.
are you looking forward
to seeing her again?.
every minute of my life.
i wanted you to see that so that you'd
think about some things very seriously,
because you're gonna be
sitting in a box somewhere.
you'll be treated properly
and humanely.
that girl is gonna grow up,
and she's gonna get married,
and your wife is gonna find someone else,
and you're gonna miss everything.
if i had done something
that would endanger my family,
i would feel just
like you do right now.
you promise not
to touch my family?.
i would never touch your family.
i would not.
are you familiar with...
...ceramic ball bearings?.
no.
just imagine 1 6 suicide vests
filled with those
ceramic ball bearings,
slipping by every metal detector
and every checkpoint in your country.
you think your economy
is fucked now?.
just think what the media
is gonna do with this. hm?.
it's gonna make 9/1 1 look like
a fucking walk in the park.
the grand central park.
so you're telling me...
...there's 1 6 jihadis
wearing suicide vests.
they're gonna walk
right across the border.
so where are they going?.
san diego, san francisco, houston...
you pick a city, they'll be there.
- and this is happening now?.
- it's happening as we speak.
sorry, what?.
it's happening as we speak.
how can you stop this?
i can't.
blackbeard lead,
containment element is set.
roger.
gun! gun! gun!

- go.
- coming out!
rat pack, this is blackbeard. we're in
contact, midtown, south of the church.

rorke over radio: overwatch.

sir?. sir?.
lt?. you all right?.
damn.
you check that box, huh?.
yeah.
good thing that was a dud.
i might've gotten hurt.
- yeah.
- whoa.
jesus.
this is not some bush-league
vest from an iraqi hut.
this is some high-speed shit.
maybe we should put this
somewhere else, huh?.
hey, sonny, find somewhere
to put this, would you?.
target secure.
set security.
one's to the north, three south.
hey, chief, target's buttoned up.
- everything's secure.
- thanks, man.
woman over radio: actual, mission
not complete. stand by for follow-on.
you only got half that jihadist cell.
- the target's secure, sir.
- this fight isn't over yet.
now, listen, the other half of that cell
is gonna be crossing the border
using a tunnel network
from mexicali at 0700.
we're coordinating with state,
but for now the birds will drop you off
outside the city where your poc
is a commander pedros.
i'll give you more details en route.
- actual, how do you copy?
- roger, main.
ok, we've got a helo
landing on the deck,
we're gonna meet a mexican
sof commander and his team.
they're gonna help infil us to
the target and join us on the assault.
- what the hell are you talking about?.
- we haven't got all of 'em yet, chief.
- and where's the rest of 'em?.
- they're in mexicali on the border.
all right.
and the rest of the boys,
how are they getting
back to the ship?.
bon homme richard
stayed on station.
they're gonna send in a marine
element to help exploit the target.
when they're done, the boys
will pull off with them.
ok. i'm thinking squad one
and myself roll out.
perfect. squad two
stays here, buttons it up,
- pulls out with the marines.
- ok.
we're moving north
of here through town,
and crossing at sunrise.
the other group will get
into texas the following day,
through juarez.
?comprendes?
hey, sir! who the hell cleared us hot
to go to mexicali anyway?.
this one's going all
the way up the flagpole.
state department's on it.
hey, sir. channel two.
hey, this tempo keeps up like this,
jackie's gonna be squeezing
that kid out on her own.
however, we hit this target quick enough,
you jump on a burro and ride that shit home.
hey, i ain't gonna need no burro.
did you get your two weeks?.
all that time i was
spending on the sat phone,
it wasn't to convince them
to let me go home,
it was to convince them
to leave your ass in charge.
- sir.
- lieutenant.
seems our governments have been
very busy to make this possible, huh?.
all the way to the top,
from what i hear.
there is something
that you have to understand.
my superiors, they're very
fearful of a mexican mogadishu.
no black hawk down
is what they're saying,
so we do need
to stay under the radar.
- i understand completely, sir.
- good.
your team's presence here is greatly
appreciated, but we are out of time.
- we need to move.
- tell me where, we go.
help piece this together for me.
- ok.
- our intel says
they're using a tunnel network
that is under a milk factory.
this mean anything to you?.
i know exactly where that is.
it's not far from here.
then that's where we're going.
of all of the places in mexicali
that you could have picked,
this is probably the worst.
the cartels control
that area from all angles.
they have us heavily outgunned.
simply reaching your target
is gonna be very difficult.
sir, we have eight foreign nationals
heading to our country.
needless to say,
they are no big fan of ours.
if they are at that factory,
that's where we're going.
lieutenant, i'll take you
anywhere you need to go,
but prepare your men for a bigger fight
than what you had imagined.
you're not fighting eight men. you're also
fighting the cartel that's protecting them.
if your targets make it
into those tunnels,
they'll disappear like ghosts.
you enter the tunnels right here.
you will walk
seven miles to this fork.
my men will tell you
what tunnel to take.
once you get to this point,
my job is done.
you're on your own.
- lieutenant, we're going now!
- roger that.
chief, we're not stopping.
we're rolling up on target, hard.
roger that, sir.
we're about 30 seconds out.
rorke over radio: one mike out
from the south entrance.
jefe! on the roof!
we gotta go. now.
sir! leave two men here!
weimy!
weimy!
i need you
to lock this shit down!
frag out!
on me.
you guys got the gate!
call! you're going to the front door!
go!
call!
changing!
damn it, sir.
how you gonna explain
that one to my family?.
get back there
so i don't have to, huh?.
clear!
grenade!
lt!
chief, i got him.
keep going. i'll cover you.
chief.
chief!
sonny: assault two,
this is assault one.
be advised, tunnel is secure
and all threats are neutralized.
lt and chief are down.
over radio: i say again,
lt and chief are down.
dave: your father was a good man.
growing up without him
is gonna be hard.
it's gonna hurt.
you'll feel alone, out to sea,
with no shore in sight.
you'll wonder,
"why me? why him? "
remember, you have
warrior's blood in your veins.
the code that made your father
who he was is the same code
that'll make you a man
he would admire, respect.
put your pain in a box.
lock it down.
like those people in the
paintings your father liked,
we are men made up of boxes,
chambers of loss and triumph,
of hurt and hope and love.
- no one is stronger or more dangerous...
- ready!
-... than a man who can harness his emotions.
- aim!
his past.
aim!
aim!
dave: use it as fuel,
as ammunition,
as ink to write the most
important letter of your life.
on behalf of the president
of the united states
and a grateful nation,
i present you this flag
in recognition of your
husband's heroic achievements.
you have my
deepest condolences.
one more flag to present.
this one i think you know.
on every deployment,
rorke carried this with him.
again, my deepest condolences.
lieutenant engel!
all: hoo-yah, lieutenant engel!
dave: before he died, your father asked me
to give you this poem by tecumseh.
i told him i'd fold it
into a paper airplane.
and, in a way,
i guess that's what i'm doing,
sailing it from him to you.
live your life
that the fear of death
can never enter your heart
trouble no one about his religion
respect others and their views
and demand they respect yours
love your life, perfect your life
beautify all things in your life
rorke: seek to make your life long
and of service to your people
when your time comes to die
be not like those whose hearts
are filled with fear of death
so that when their time comes
they weep and pray
for a little more time to live their lives
over again in a different way
sing your death song
and die like a hero going home
