- ahh...
those poor sons of guns. they're
holding them against their will.
they're gonna run them into

bring the rest of it,
i will on my next payday.
ok.

that's bullshit!
goddamn it, rodney.
did you not hear me?
did you not hear me?
motherfucker,
i took a hit in there.
i told you i can't really control
myself in the middle of a fight, man.
it's all a blur.
and don't fucking poke
on me again, either.
no more excuses.
no more iraqi stories.
you just got to learn
how to take a fall
because you owe me
a lot of fucking money.
well, i can't pay you back
your money by taking a dive
in this nickel and dime bullshit.
you'd better figure out something
and figure it out quick.
yeah, let's go fight up in jersey.
up in the ramapos they got fights.
don't talk to me about that.
it's not for you.
why? i heard they're big money.
look, rodney, go work in the mill.
like your father and brother.
this isn't a way for you
to make a living.
you're a good kid
with a good heart.
you can do a lot worse
than living your life
like your brother, believe me.
i don't want to work
at the fucking mill, man.
i want to be just like you, john.
we'll talk later.
hey.
hi.
where you been?
out with the boys.
well, looks like...
your boys play rough.
want a drink?
no. the place looks nice.
put it up!
hey.
let me see your hands.
what?
let me see your hands.
rodney, come here.
let me see your fucking hands.
- come on, man.
- huh?
don't give me no shit.
is that the best you can do?
what do you think i should do?
i don't know.
shovel asphalt for
the highway department.
sell fucking shoes.
come work at the mill.
come work at the mill. i told you
roach would give you a job.
no, man,
i'd rather be fucking dead.
fuck the mill.
fuck the mill.
i work at the mill,
you little fucker.
it's good enough for me.
it was good enough for our dad.
the fucking mill killed our dad!
just don't be... hey.
just don't be too proud
to work for a living.
there's nothing wrong with it.
what'd you say?
nothing wrong with
working for a living.
- working for a living?
- yeah.
what do you call this,
motherfucker?
is that working for a living, huh?
is it working for a living when
i carried my best friend's legs
under this arm, and the rest
of him under this arm?
i saw a fucking baby with
his fucking head cut off!
i saw a fucking pile of feet
in the middle of the street,
and i had to clean it up!
i gave my fucking life
for this country.
that's not work?
and what's it done for me, huh?
what's it fucking done for me?!
fuck you.
get me that fight up in ramapo.
i told you not to
bring that up again.
i need one last
fucking fight, john.
just give me one good fight, please.
one good fucking fight, please!
that's all i'm asking you.
can you please do that for me?
no, you gotta trust
me when i tell you,
you don't want to set foot
in those mountains.
what is the big fucking deal?
the big fucking deal?
the big fucking deal is i've dealt
with these guys for a long time,
and when they don't get what
they want, they get nasty.
they get nasty, do they?
- yeah. you don't know.
- yeah?
well, john, i don't really have
a lot of fucking options, man.
i can't fucking catch up
doing this small-town shit!
- calm the fuck down.
- come the fuck on, man!
- come on, please! i'm sorry!
- i'm trying to protect you!
just fucking call them up,
john. please?
i'm not doing it, rodney.
i'm not gonna call them.
well, i'm not leaving until you do.
- call them up.
- rodney...
just please call them up.
- john, please call them up.
- rodney...
please call them up.
i'm asking you for one fight.
please call them up.
- please call them up.
- fuck, rodney!
you fuck with these inbreds,
you'll come crawling back.
if you're lucky.
i don't really want
to be doing this.
this is not fucking around.
let me talk to them.
let me talk to them.
yeah?
what the fuck you want, petty?
<i>march, march,
where are my soldiers?</i>
<i>where are my soldiers?</i>
no... uh-uh! come on.
hey!
we don't want
to wake up the neighbors.
you know what? let's wake up
the neighbors. one, two, three!
so funny! oh, my gosh!
wait a minute!
ok, go, go, go, go, go!
- we're gonna play nice, right?
- yeah!
what do you want?
you want to race me?
what do you want? what do you want?
- racer? huh?
- i want to go on the horsey.
- where are the horsies? huh?
- over there. over there.
- race you over there.
- yeah.
lily... lily, can you just
watch them for one second?
- you're staying at your dad's?
- yeah.
you know, i'm trying
to give it some life.
i went to his funeral.
i know.
thank you. that was...
important to me.
thank you.
are you back at the mill?
just can't get enough of it,
you know?
i hear they're gonna close it.
yeah, looks like it.
you know, cheaper to...
uh, get steel from china.
god, i've missed you so much.
i've missed you so much.
i was hoping that, uh...
we could work it out.
you know?
the things that were
keeping us apart and...
you know, take that
next step is something
i want to do with you.
because, uh...
i can't be without you, lena.
i can't.
i'm pregnant.
ok.
wow.
wow.
you, uh...
that's, uh...
that's wonderful news.
it is?
yeah. that's wonderful news.
i'm real happy for you, lena.
i really am.
that's wonderful news.
you're gonna be a hell of a mom.
wow!
you're gonna be a hell of a mom!
i'm so sorry.
- i have to go.

<i>ok.</i>
hey, man!
what about it?
goddamn, uncle red.
- look like they fed you pretty good.
- yeah.
you're fit as a racehorse.
how you doing?
still this side
of the grass, you know.
hey, i got something
for your daddy.
i had a feeling that was you.
- you're still raising them?
- isn't that pretty? yeah.
yeah, when the weather permits.
say, do you want to come over
to the cemetery with me?
shit, yeah.
rodney here?
does he want to come?
ah, i don't know where he is.
let me get this shit inside...
run over with you.
- hey, grab your rifle.
maybe we can get
a shot off before dark.
i saw a real nice eight-point
out there the other night.
yup. see if i'm still a
better shot than you.
well...
let's go get us a buck, huh?
we can circle around these.
seen a feral cat.
degroat?
i didn't drive five
and a half hours
to watch you play fucking cards.
well, when you owe as much
as you owe me, petty...
i guess i'm the last
person you want to see.
step into the room, fighter man.
let me get a good look at you.
- and what's your name?
- rodney.
is that it?
just rodney?
rodney baze.
rodney baze.
well...
rodney baze...
i hear you're quite
the crazy fucker in the ring.
makes me want
to jump in there with you...
and see who walks out.
we're standing so close,
i guess we could do it right now.
you gonna be a good boy
and take a dive,
like petty said you would?
or am i gonna have to
teach you a lesson?
no, he's good. he's good.
- teach me a lesson?
- i gave you our word.
yeah, teach you a lesson.
everything's good.
let me hear you say it.
teach me a lesson?
yeah, isn't that
what we talked about?
- is this boy deaf?
- no, no, it's...
you been hit too many times?
listen, we talked,
everything's good.
hey, yeah.
i like this one.
he's tough.
- and angry.
- plenty tough.
four-tours-in-iraq tough.
now, why the hell you want
to come up here and fight,
or, hell, anywhere,
when you've been fighting
over there for so long?
i just need the money, man.
mmm... yeah.
well... we all need money...
don't we, petty?
so...
why don't me and john
discuss this deal
while you go put
your fight face on.
didn't we just discuss the deal?
what, you think i was asking?
hey! don't! keep your
fucking hands off him.
just checking his reflexes.
you step out. step out and we'll...
i'll take care of this.
step out, rodney.
i should've popped
that motherfucker.
well, that would be the last
motherfucker you ever popped.
am i supposed to be scared of him
'cause he sucks on a lollipop?
look at me.
you gotta make this look good.
you can't embarrass degroat
in front of these guys
that he's got coming up.
well...
i can't promise to go down
for that motherfucker.
did you hear me?
did you hear me?!
- yeah. i heard you.
- good.
now get your shit
and let's get going.
come on, get ready.
showtime.
you ain't fighting with
that shit on, are you?
it's bare-knuckle up here.
take 'em off.
be careful out there.
keep it going for a little while
and then you know what to do.
look at that beauty.
clean shot?
yeah, right in the heart.
inch either way, we'd be tracking
the son of a bitch all night,
like the last time, you remember?
- yeah.
- you see anything?
not a goddamn thing.
come on, help me.
give me a hand with this.
aah!
get him! come on!

- yeah. yeah.
impressive stuff.
all heart and fist.
that boy don't look so good.
hey, hey, uh, don't...
don't blow your nose,
your eyes will...
swell up.
hell, mercy, you took a whooping.
you looked angry out there.
i thought maybe...
for a second you
weren't a good listener.
i was just reacting.
i just lost it a little bit.
oh, yeah, well, hell,
i don't blame you.
i'd done the same thing,
guy pounded on me like that.
- yeah.
- so our slate is clean.
mmm...
well, yes, as long as you
brought me the rest of my money.
don't tell me you come all this way
and didn't bring me what you owe.
this was it. now we're even.
that was the deal.
oh. i must've got confused.
whatever.
you need this?
here. wipe your face.
last time i'm coming up here,
i can tell you that.
sorry as hell you had
to go through that, rodney.
it's not your fault.
i asked you to take me up here.
it's both of our faults.
but we're through with
those ramapo fuckers.
that crazy son of a bitch
can kiss my ass
if he thinks i'm doing
business with him again.
strung out fucking tweaker.
oh, what the fuck?
what the fuck is this?
ok.
ok. ok. ok. ok.
what's the game?
yeah?
i think your left rear's gone down.
what?
i said...
i think your left rear's gone down.
what shit you talking?
i ain't talking shit.
and our slate ain't clean,
motherfucker.
get that other one out.
let's go. go get him.
get the fuck out. come on.
get your fucking ass...
<i>"russ...</i>
<i>i'm sorry about the other day.</i>
<i>i know you're looking out for me.</i>
<i>but you gotta understand
that i'm different</i>
<i>than i was before i left.</i>
<i>and i think that i always will be.</i>
<i>i can't explain how exactly.</i>
<i>my head is just full of stuff

oh, man.
you should have kept

morning, russell.
glad you're home.
thanks.
i guess you, uh...
heard that, uh...
i stopped by to see lena.
yeah, i'm aware.
not why i'm here.
<i>i said...</i>
<i>i think your left rear's gone down.</i>
<i>what shit you talking?</i>
<i>i ain't talking shit.</i>
<i>and our slate ain't clean,
motherfucker.</i>
- turn it off.
<i>- get that other one out.</i>
we don't need to hear it again.
i've spoken to jersey state,
bergen county, fish and game.
all of them have dealt with this
harlan degroat before.
the problem is that
the people up in those hills,
they don't cooperate.
getting information from these
people is like pulling teeth.
it's a whole 'nother
world up in there.
generations upon
generations of these people
never even come down
off that mountain.
got their own breed of justice
and it does not include us.
even the local police
sent in several squad cars,
but they haven't been able
to get nothing yet.
so you know that i'm stuck here
with my hands tied.
what the fuck does that mean?
that they aren't gonna...
do anything about this
or look for rodney?
i did not say that, russell.
i said that they're having
a difficult time
and i'm having jurisdiction issues.
but i'm gonna be
on it until it's done.
what the fuck?
- bud.
- i mean, you know...
we know john petty's dead.
i mean, jesus, you know,
damn near hear him dying
on dan's phone.
but rodney might
still be out there.
i know that this is very hard
for you, but...
i do have a procedure
that i have to follow.
it sounds like there's
no procedure at all.
- bud!
- no, no, no, no, no.
it sounds like they're not
doing a goddamn thing.
now, either you're all
afraid to go in there...
or, uh...
you just don't give a shit.
- you walking down the wrong road.
i said i'm into it,
and i said i'll handle it.
don't make this personal.
- you need to stay out of my business.
- stay out of your business.
- knock it off.
- stay out of your business.
you know what?
while i was away, it seems that
all that you was into
was my business.
so that's what this is.
you got a problem with me.
yeah, i got a problem with you.
i'm not the one who was out
drinking and driving.
got locked up and had
to leave his woman alone
'cause of something i did,
a mistake i made.
and i don't know nothing
about what happened to rodney.
nothing at all. i'm just
trying to do my job.
and i'm giving you my word that
i'm gonna be on it until it's done.
until it's done.
mmm. well.
russell. come on.
what is it?
you want me to show you out?
i'll be around.
dan.
- where you going now?
- no, it's good.
- hey, russ, listen, i'm sorry.
- hey.
i know how tough this is,
but i'm here to help anyway i can.
then get me an address for degroat.
an address? how am i
gonna get that address?
don't give me that shit, dan. you know
as well as i do that john petty has one.
well, i don't...
i don't know.
look, i'll see if i
can dig that up.
no, no, no, don't see
if you can dig it up.
- do it.
- russell, listen to me.
if you're smart,
you let these boys handle it.
i know these guys. this degroat
is a nasty son of a bitch.
you let me worry about...
who's a nasty son of a bitch.
we'll follow you.
damn, looks like john still owes
money to these people.
a hell of a lot of money.
i know they had this whole deal,
but i didn't realize
it was this big.
- what deal?
- well, this bare-knuckle deal
up and down the appalachians.
i don't know that much about it,
but my guess is,
rodney went up there to fight.
well, why didn't you just
say something to wesley?
well, i don't... i don't know.
i mean, i didn't...
i didn't know what to say.
john should've known better.
i think he did, red,
but rodney forced his hand.
he thought it was the only way
to pay off that debt.
i don't see degroat's address, but
i do know it's up in the ramapos.
and, russell, please
hear me when i tell you,
you'd be way better off letting
the authorities deal with him.
they're not doing
such a good job, dan.
well, i hear you,
but john hated dealing with them.
i'm surprised they haven't come
down here to get their money.
money and drugs,
that's the only thing
that drove that crazy
son of a bitch.
are you ready for this?
i guess so.
you watch your ass.
gotta say, fellas, that is sharp.
'66 or '67?
man, you don't see
that bolero red much.
you got the tuxedo black
and ash gold everywhere, but...
yeah, this is sweet.
three-ninety-six big block?
yep.
that's a true 138 ss
right there, man.
fucking rocket ship.
well, i don't doubt it with
that muncie four speed.
hmm!
how long to restore it?
a couple years.
a couple years? worth it.
you got nitrous?
nah, nah, just a heavy foot.
yeah.
you know who's got any candy here?
- what do you mean, "candy?"
- you know what i mean.
yeah.
you a fucking cop?
am i a fucking cop?
do i look like a fucking cop?
who's the old man in the truck?
don't worry about him.
he ain't a cop, either.
- what you looking for, man?
- whatever you got. you know...
crank, 20/20's, blue bellies,
crystals or pure.
- it don't matter.
- wow, he knows his shit.
yeah, we got some buzzard dust,
some critty up at the house.
all right.
we'll get you feelin' shitty,
my friend.
good. all right, i'll follow you?
yo, it's tiny.
- you wait right here, all right?
- all right.
all right.
brought them boys out here
looking for some of the train.
yo, if they got their
greenbacks, that's fine.
come on up.
who the fuck are you?
i'm just passing through.
i ain't asked you where you were going.
i asked you who you were.
well, i didn't ask who you were.
we just want to get high,
and our money's green.
well, then you come
to the right place.
but i got to say, you got
some balls coming up in here,
not knowing nobody.
but if your money's green...
then it's all good.
that's pure glass.
fire it up.
looks good to me. how much?
nah, fire that shit up.
it'll blow your balls off, brother.
i told you, i'm good. how much?
you don't know, um...
harlan degroat, do you?
is that a joke?
why would i joke about that?
'cause this is his house.
he around?
i wouldn't know.
i ain't his babysitter.
all right.
hey, red.
not now. we'll come by later.
yo!
you forgot this.
oh, shit.
put your hands where
i can see 'em, gentlemen.
russell baze?
that's right.
chief barnes from
the north braddock police
alerted us early this evening
that you were up here.
you're lucky i got here when i did.
if the locals knew
why you were here,
they'd zip you up and you'd
be leaving in a body bag.
do i need to ask if you're
carrying concealed weapons?
no, sir.
- no, sir.
- all right.
then, given that you're an ex-con,
likely carrying concealed weapons,
you have a choice.
either i arrest you now or
i follow you to the state line.
with respect, officer,
my brother might be up here,
and i ain't leaving without him.
i'll only do chief
barnes a favor once.
you return and i'll
arrest you on the spot.
there's nothing you can do
from inside a jail cell.
am i making myself clear,
gentlemen?
yes, sir, you are.
all right.
then i'll follow you out.
that boy was always troubled.
ever since he was a little kid.
you could see it in his eyes.
especially after your mama died.
hey, russell.
wesley.
i just heard
from the jersey police.
they found your brother.
he's dead.
ok.
a hunter's dog dug him up.
sorry.
they just called me.
the coroner's gonna
examine his body.
i suspect that you'll have
him back by the weekend.
place is really hard to locate.
the roads are all mostly trails.
- let me go talk to him.
- no, no, no. i got it.
- it's ok.
- yeah?
you hardly touched your food.
i ate enough.
i appreciate you coming over.
- i wanted to.
- mmm.
we wanted to.
i'm sorry about rodney.
i'm really sorry.
he was put through a lot, you know?
and so have you.
but please don't do anything.
ok?
you already tried.
you're lucky you
got out of there alive.
let wesley handle this.
let him do his job.
he's a good man, russell.
- you want me to take it?
- no, i got it.
ok.
we may not have the...
the fire and the flame...
but we got something good.
you know?
can we put this behind us?
yeah.
yeah.
- thanks for dinner.
- mm-hmm.
you ready?
let's go.
police!
on the ground!
harlan degroat! police!
get down on the ground!
get down!
the guy was expecting us.
ooh, yeah!
yeah! yeah!
ok.
every time, it's just...
<i>forgive me my sins, o lord.</i>
<i>forgive me my sins.</i>
the sins of my youth...
the sins of my age,
the sins of my soul...
the sins of my body.
my idle sins...
my serious voluntary sins...
the sins i know, the sins
we have concealed for so long...
<i>which are now
hidden from my memory.</i>
<i>my jesus, forget and forgive
what we have been.</i>
<i>amen.</i>
hey! hey, baze!
russell! come back!
russell!
what are you doing here, man?
you can't be back here.
wesley told me not to
let anybody back here.
- give it up, please.
- dan, where's that ledger?
huh?
you can't be here.
where's that ledger, dan?
russell, don't do this.
let him handle it.
- this it?
- russell, don't.
- you can stay if you want.
- i don't want any part of it.
<i>what?</i>
harlan degroat?
who wants to know?
<i>i've taken over
john petty's accounts.</i>
- who's this?
<i>- listen to me.</i>
<i>i'm willing to settle his debt.</i>
<i>and we can keep this deal going.</i>
who the fuck is this?
it don't matter.
you come to braddock...
the money's yours.
how the fuck did you get my number?
<i>who the fuck is this?</i>
hey, we're closed.
uh...
why don't you get your fat
fucking ass in the kitchen,
fix me up a salmon burger?
see what that bitch
has in the register.
what do you say, dan?
- you look fit.
- well, thanks.
- staying out of trouble?
- yeah, trying.
yeah, i know what you mean.
yeah.
so, uh...
i hear you might have
some money for me.
who, me?
you, somebody.
no, not me. no.
well, do you know where
petty keeps his money?
uh, no... petty, you know, he...
he keeps everybody at arm's length.
i just tend bar.
well, you just tend bar
from all the way back here?
- well, i'm just...
- that's a good trick, dan.
so let me get this straight.
you don't know where that money is?
i don't know,
honest to god, i don't.
i swear to god, i don't know.
- you swear to god?
- yeah.
well, if you're invoking
a deity over this,
i guess i'm mistaken.
- yeah.
- mmm.
a long way to drive, dan.
shoot
- i didn't come five hours...
- i don't know!
to not get my fucking money!
show me where that safe is.
ok, ok!
ok, i'll do it.
ok, all right.

the combination.
- julie, call 911.
- wait a sec, i'm trying.

- three.
- ...one more number, wait...
- two.
just give me a second so
i can remember the numbers!
- time's up, dan.
