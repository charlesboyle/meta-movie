i can't wait that long.
<i>what do you mean? tell me where you are

no, it's okay, you don't have to.
<i>martha, i wanna see you. please.</i>
martha?
<i>martha.</i>
i made you some tea.
thanks.
you're dripping everywhere.
ted should be up from the city soon,
make us some dinner.
i'm pretty tired.
is it okay if i just go to bed?
sure.
get a good night's sleep tonight
and you'll be as good as new tomorrow.
- hi.
- hey.
<i>hey'...</i>
- well?
- she seems okay.
what did she say?
not much.
she's really tired.
- yeah?
- yeah.
where's she been?
she had some boyfriend.
they were living in the catskills.
- what?
- it's okay.
heh, it's not really, lucy.
it's fine.
she's here now.
hmm.
- how long is she gonna be staying again?
- ha-ha-ha!
oh, martha.
- welcome.
- hi.
- great to finally meet you.
- yeah.
- did you sleep all right?
- mm-hm.
good.
so how do you like our house?
it's nice.
it's just a rental.
yeah, well, i love it.
mm.
<i>i didn't know there was a lake.
mm. yeah.</i>
do you still like to swim?
- you don't still live in the city?
- heh, heh.
we do. we just like to come up here
on weekends and holidays.
you know. ted is working
on this new building downtown...
and as soon as it's finished...
we're taking one of the apartments.
do you wanna see pictures?
do you think she's excited
to have you back?
this is just the view, and obviously
the interiors aren't finished...
- but it's nice, right?
- mm-hm.
we were supposed to move in
in the spring...
but, uh, construction was halted, so
it's gonna be just a little while longer.
yes, just a little while longer.
okay, sorry, no more work talk.
aren't you hungry?
not really, sorry.
well, you have to eat something.
it's okay,
i can make you something later.
where are we?
connecticut.
well, how far are we?
from what?
yesterday.
you mean from where i picked you up?
about three hours. why?
i was just wondering.
put out your cigarette.
why?
just do it.
is that him?
yeah.
<i>hey'...</i>
is this martha?
hi.
- how you doing?
- great.
oh, you've got a really nice place here.
it's as much yours as it is mine.
- i thought you quit.
- i did.
i worry for you.
i know.
i'm sorry.
don't apologize to me. it's your body.
zoe, look after this girl.
for once in her life,
she deserves some real care.
i will.
she's been great.
everyone's been really great.
good.
martha.
you look like a marcy may.
marcy was my grandmother's name.
wow, there you go.
heh.
i'm going in.
do you wanna join'?
sure.
- you coming?
- in a minute.
martha!
that is an interesting choice
of swim wear.
martha, get out of the water.
- what?
- get out of the water.
why aren't you wearing any clothes?
what is wrong with you?
- you can't do that around here, you know.
- why?
because there are kids around.
people come by.
- so?
- you just can't, ok? get outta the water.
we don't do that kind of thing.
get out.
you could have asked me.
i have a bathing suit you could borrow.
what's wrong with you?
jesus.
hey, hey, marcy.
- max.
- hey.
- where do they go at night?
- uh...
pfft! i don't know. heh.
i never get invited.
you wanna have a drink with me?
they won't be back for a few hours.
i shouldn't.
i'm not gonna drink for a while, actually.
i think it's a good idea for me.
all right.
wake up, everybody.
good morning.
we switch out jobs each day
so we all know how to do different things.
do you knit?
no.
i can learn, though.
oh, no, that's okay.
you'll find your role.
it takes time for people
to find their role in a new family.
mostly, we sell blankets in town
because we still need some money.
but once the farm is up and running,
we'll be self-sufficient...
and we'll never have
to worry about it again.
hey. i'm sorry, patrick. hey.
- what're you sorry for'?
- ahem.
um, here.
how are you, man?
good, you?
feels like...
- it's a really great consistency.
- yeah, and it's sticky.
and it holds together like glue.
- and it can flow around. like...
- you should talk to her.
that's why i need to
figure out how to do it.
yeah.
yeah, you'll figure it out. don't look...
how's everything
going so far, marcy may?
- good.
- do you like it here?
yeah, it's... it's great.
i want you to feel at home.
- i do, thank you.
- mm-hm.
i know people have abandoned you
your whole life.
- your father.
- what?
i don't blame you
for not trusting people.
but if you're ever going to have
a meaningful relationship...
you need to let your guard down.
it's not your fault, but it's there.
and if you feel safe here,
and i hope you do, let us in.
we wanna help you.
yeah. we think you're fucking awesome.
but if you're gonna live here...
you need to be a part of things.
play another song.
do "a patch of land".
it's not a song.
good morning.
good morning.
- how are you feeling today?
- good.
yeah? good.
so, uh, i stopped by the juice place
and i got you a kale with ginseng.
do you mind just putting your feet
off the counter?
i got you a kale and ginseng
because it's just...
i don't know,
i thought it might make you feel better.
if that doesn't appeal to you,
i also got a pineapple orange.
yeah, that might be better. thank you.
okay.
oh, and i also got you protein bars,
just in case you want a snack.
why is the house so big?
the house isn't so big.
it's big for two people.
well, yeah, but we like to entertain.
and sometimes friends come up
for the weekend...
sometimes we have parties.
it's just nice to have space.
so no one else lives here?
of course no one else lives here.
you're married?
yeah.
when?
april.
i tried calling you, but, uh, apparently
you got rid of your cell phone.
i lost it.
you didn't think to get a new one?
i got used to not having one.
- cocktails, anyone?
- no, thank you.
martha?
mm-mm.
was it a big wedding?
about 40 people.
mostly ted's family.
- did aunt dora come?
- ha, yes.
did she smoke like a chimney
and complain about everything?
- she's not that bad.
- you didn't have to live with her.
you lived with dora?
she lived with me after mom died.
- and where were you?
- college.
huh.
- she'd love to know you're okay.
- she hates me.
she does not hate you.
- look at me. come on.
- mm-mm.
- no.
- i don't have any pictures of you.
god, you're gorgeous.
it's really rather irritating.
there you go.
you don't need to shake it.
that's a myth.
- is it true married people don't fuck?
- what?
no, heh.
excuse me.
- put this on.
- you're kidding.
- your clothes are disgusting. try it.
- why does it matter?
because it feels good to put on
something nice and comfortable.
it looks really good on you,
you little shit.
whatever makes you happy, mama bear.
you're making fun of me,
and i think it looks really good on you.
what, ifs not good?
no, no, it's fine.
uh, it's a bit dry.
it's not dry.
it just needs a little bit more salt,
that's all.
she seems better today.
yeah.
i wish i didn't have to go tomorrow.
well, let me take you.
no.
i don't want her to be alone.
you'll be nice to her, right?
i'm always nice.
oh.
i know you feel like something bad
just happened, marcy may.
but you have to trust me,
that wasn't bad.
that was truly good.
we've all been in this situation.
we wouldn't all still be here
if what happened in that room was bad.
we all love each other very much.
we're all together on this.
you have to trust us.
do you believe me?
yeah.
you're so lucky.
i'd give anything
to have my first time again.
really?
yeah.
it's so special.
i can't remember anything.
i just woke up and felt this pain.
that's the cleansing.
it's good. it means it's working
if you can't remember things.
you're cleansing yourself of the past
and the toxins.
you need to share yourself.
don't be selfish.
i'm not.
so smile, then.
enjoy this amazing night.
it only happens once.
thanks.
is that a new one, max?
there's one right there.
<i>yeah. is that a new song?</i>
yeah, i wrote it yesterday.
that was the first half.
great.
that was nice.
thanks, man.
yeah.
all right.
this is called "marcy's song".
well, she's
<i>she's just a picture</i>
<i>who lives</i>
<i>lives on my wall</i>
<i>well, she's</i>
<i>she's just a picture</i>
<i>the reason, reason,
reason it is so small</i>
<i>the smile's so inviting</i>
<i>ana' her body so rah'</i>
<i>well, she's</i>
<i>she's just a picture</i>
<i>just a picture</i>
<i>that's all</i>
<i>well, you stand there</i>
<i>stand there with the nightshade</i>
<i>her dripping</i>
<i>dripping down your hands</i>
<i>you ask me</i>
<i>ask me about the lightning</i>
<i>the lady, lady, lady,
she understands</i>
<i>so dream for the future</i>
<i>water for the sand</i>
<i>and the strangeness is wandering</i>
<i>through many calling lands</i>
you've been saying
the same thing to me for two months...
and i still don't have them.
i'm going into the meeting
in 14 fucking days.
great. no, that's all i wanted to hear.
thank you.
- what're you doing?
- cleaning.
i thought i'd help out more.
all right.
ahh. i'm gonna take the boat out.
do you wanna come'?
is lucy coming?
uh, no, she had to run to the city.
oh.
come on,
i'll teach you how to drive the boat.
it's okay.
come on.
sorry.
it's going, it's going, it's going.
okay. okay.
all right.
okay. all right. okay.
want one?
yeah.
how's it been with lucy?
fine.
is it strange to spend time together?
no. why?
it's been a long time.
i don't know. it's normal, i guess.
where is she?
she's at the doctor.
<i>why?
getting a checkup.</i>
we are trying to have a baby.
what?
i just can'! imagine it.
lucy holding a baby.
why?
well, she wouldn't know
what to do with it.
do you want a baby?
mm-hm.
if she's happy, i'm happy.
so you're unhappy?
what, now? ha-ha-ha.
no, no, no, she's doing well.
she's doing well.
do you want another?
here.
she is, um, relieved to have you back.
you know, you worried her.
why?
because you disappeared.
you hadn't called in two years.
i just lost track, i guess.
well, it's a good thing to let people know
where you are, martha.
people worry.
i didn't think lucy would worry about me.
well, she did.
can i go swimming?
hey, you don't need to ask.
- jesus christ.
- what?
- martha, what are you doing?
- nothing.
jesus.
you can't just come in here like that.
sorry.
goddamn it, what's wrong?
i'm just having a hard time
sleeping alone.
all you do is sleep. christ.
just stay. stay.
why would you think it was okay
to come in here like that?
i don't know. it's a big bed.
you guys were on the other side.
you can't come into our room
when we're having sex.
that's not normal. it's private.
sorry.
you don't need to apologize.
just...
i need you to understand
why it's not okay.
okay.
- do you?
- yeah.
well?
because it's private and not normal.
oh, god.
just lie down, martha.
- oh, this is just brilliant.
- don't go.
just go to sleep.
i'm sorry you slept out here.
thank you for being patient.
i didn't have much choice, did i?
i'm just trying to make sure she's okay.
i have two weeks a year
to come up here...
- and try to relax.
- i know.
- i'm under pressure...
- i know you are.
to get this building up and running
or the bank takes it.
that has nothing to do with martha.
no, i guess my point is,
i just don'! need the extra stress.
i'm her only family.
you know, she needs to know
that she can depend on me right now.
- it's complicated.
- as complicated as it might be...
we can't ignore the fact
that her behavior is fucking insane.
i'm sorry.
hey.
do you ever hear things
hit the roof at night?
no.
maybe it's pinecones?
where did you pick up gardening?
there was a garden where i lived.
you're good.
i'm good at some things.
i know you are.
was he ever physical with you?
who?
your boyfriend.
what do you mean?
did he ever hit you?
no.
you had a bruised ear...
and when you called me,
you were hysterical.
i never noticed.
are you sure he didn't hit you?
yeah.
you can tell me.
he never hit me.
i wish you felt more comfortable
talking to me.
i do.
so talk.
there's nothing to talk about.
i had a boyfriend, he lied to me, i left.
that's it.
not everything has to be a big deal.
- hey, don't stare.
- no.
no.
you okay?
yeah.
he's right.
i don't know why i'm so weak.
you're not.
you'll quit.
who's that?
her name is sarah, i think.
you should handle her.
you think?
yeah, you're ready.
zoe can help, but you'll be great.
jesus.
- hey, guys.
- hi.
- katie, this is sarah.
- hi, sarah.
zoe and marcy may.
- hi.
- hi.
we share all this.
so if it fits, you can wear it.
cool.
and this is where we sleep.
you can take any bed that's open
or, uh... you can sleep downstairs.
- i'm hungry. can we eat?
- we don't eat until the evening.
- really?
- you'll get used to it.
your body doesn't need that much food.
hi. hi.
he's beautiful.
who's the mother?
katie.
but we all help out.
is patrick the father?
uh-huh.
come here. oh, yeah.
looks just like him.
oh, oh.
all the kids here are boys.
he only has boys.
you're good with him.
do you wanna hold him?
no. i don't...
i don't have to take care of them, do i?
no, not if you don't want to.
there are plenty of jobs you can do.
you'll find your role.
it takes time to find your role
in a new family, huh?
yeah.
i called my dad today
to ask for money.
does patrick know?
yeah, he asked me to.
sometimes if there's something
we need, i'll call.
well, how was it?
fine. they're not bad people.
did he give you the money?
yeah. he thinks i'm on drugs.
did you tell him that you're not?
no, that's why he gives it to me.
i guess he'd rather pay for it
than think i'm sucking dick for it.
i've done drugs.
not a lot,
but i tried pretty much everything.
except heroin.
it's good to try everything at least once.
you find out who you are.
what about drinking? do you drink?
no.
i have, but i don't.
good. we don't drink.
it makes you angry and less focused.
don't get the wrong idea, sarah.
we don't really talk to our old families.
- i wouldn't call my dad anyway...
- marcy.
<i>hey.)'...</i>
hey, have you met sarah?
sally, yeah.
that's enough.
half. half is fine.
okay.
excuse me.
i can finish this if you wanna go to bed.
i don't mind.
why don't you get some sleep?
okay.
hi.
what...? what do i have to do?
nothing you don't want to.
drink this, it will help you relax.
thanks.
it's herbal. it starts the cleansing.
we've all done it
so there's nothing to worry about.
why do i have to wear this robe?
heh.
i know it's a bit silly
but it's just part of it.
oh, my god.
you look amazing.
thanks.
you know,
this is your special night with him.
enjoy it.
you'll be great.
yeah.
i don't feel well.
it's okay, just lie down.
shouldn't i start cooking?
well, i just made a salad
and ted is cooking the fish.
- i thought we were going to cook.
- we cooked last night.
oh, yeah.
do you ever have that feeling where
you can't tell if something is a memory...
or if it's something you dreamed?
not really. no.
do you blame me for anything?
no.
like what?
i don't know.
i'm trying to figure out
why we stopped talking.
i don't really think about it.
really?
well, we were far apart.
sometimes i wonder if maybe
i couldn't have taken better care of you.
the past doesn't matter.
it does matter.
well, i took care of myself.
i know you did, but sometimes
i think i could've done more.
stop.
you really never think about it?
no.
you're not angry with me?
god, i know you don't think much of me...
but i knew what i was doing then
and i still do.
no, martha, i think the world of you.
sometimes i just think
i should have come home...
and made sure you went to college.
you had so much potential.
i don't need your guidance now...
and i didn't then.
i am a teacher and a leader.
you just never let me be that.
but now, i am... i know who i am.
a teacher and a leader?
what are you talking about?
- i am always...
- dinner's ready!
i was the one who encouraged you
to push yourself, always.
you were the one who shut me out.
- martha...
- just because we're sisters...
doesn't mean we need to talk about
everything that comes into your head.
ted:
dinner's ready.
come on, don't be rude.
so, what are your plans, martha?
for what?
um, life.
i don't know.
are you thinking about
what you could do for a job?
no.
<i>you're at an age when you need to start
thinking about a proper career.</i>
why?
it is a part of adult life.
there are other ways to live.
- really?
- sure.
like what?
i don't know.
people don't need careers.
people should just exist.
he's just saying we should start talking
about what you are interested in.
we can come up with some ideas
that we can put together...
but there are moments in my life when i
would love to just go to france and exist.
- you can do that if you want to.
- it is not that simple.
you know, it's not your fault,
but you learned to measure success...
<i>by money and possessions.</i>
it's just not the right way to live.
it's not the right way to live?
what is the right way to live exactly?
martha, what is the right way
to live? hm?
is it, um...
vanishing off the face of the earth,
not calling your family
for two years...
or until they're worried sick,
is that the right way to live?
or is it living without possessions
until you need someone...
and then turning up on our doorstep...
where you know you can get some?
is that the right way to live? no, no.
you sit there,
lecturing us about our lives.
and so far, i have not witnessed one sign
that you have any values of your own.
you should remember
that you are living under my roof.
you are eating my food
and you should watch your mouth...
because you are rude.
you don't know anything about it.
hello?
<i>hello?</i>
who's this?
<i>who's this?</i>
<i>zoe?</i>
is she not there?
<i>she's not.</i>
where is she?
<i>who is this?</i>
who's this?
<i>marlene lewis.</i>
<i>who's this?</i>
<i>marcy?</i>
steal.
have you seen my brother?
he's got really red hair
and a bunch of freckles.
good job.
- very nice.
- hey.
- let's mind our own beeswax, huh?
- heh, okay.
i'm seriously the best one at this
and no one will out-fast my hands.
yes. oh, god.
oh, god, you are so hot
when you shoot.
you know that?
this just makes my willy hard.
get off me.
thank you. i'm set.
all right, marcy, let's have fun.
make sure your knees
are smooth and loose...
and your heart is in the right place.
max, is this just an excuse to grape marcy?
i'm teaching her how to shoot, okay?
and then you just squeeze.
hi, patrick.
nice shot.
<i>hey.)'...</i>
focus.
take a deep breath.
feel the tension leaving your stomach
and moving to your hands.
think of someone who hurt you,
who lied to you. feel it.
feel how they made you feel.
let it build.
let it transfer to the gun.
building in the gun.
breathe out.
release.
feels good, right?
yeah.
now try that.
what do you mean?
shoot it.
they're living animals.
so shoot max then.
yeah, go ahead. let's get it up.
breathe.
- go on.
- all right, fuck this.
don't walk away from me, max.
the cat has terminal cancer.
- it's in excruciating pain.
- i can't.
you know, max has no substance.
he's just here to freeload,
be around the girls.
but you're different.
you're a teacher and a leader.
you don't see it
because no one let you believe it.
you're a teacher and a leader, marcy.
now prove it.
that cat reminds you of some fluffy thing
you think you used to love.
you're clinging
to some misguided emotion.
so i could spend my life being selfish,
living alone and using this gift for me...
but i've sacrificed
in order to be what you need me to be.
why don't you trust me?
i do.
then you shouldn't need me
to explain everything.
why...? why did you do that?
you said it was sick.
one of them was sick.
zoe knew which one it was.
sorry.
try again?
my sweetheart
come here.
ready.
aim.
you shouldn't smoke.
what?
i don't smoke.
especially if you're trying to have a kid.
maybe you should
mind your own business.
i can't deal with talking to anybody
right now.
press them together.
i think that's better.
you look really pretty.
thanks.
i see you, see you now
<i>smoking, drinking</i>
<i>never, never thinking</i>
<i>of tomorrow</i>
<i>nonchalant</i>
this guy...
<i>diamonds shining</i>
<i>dancing, dining</i>
hi.
um, everybody, i want you
to meet my sister. this is martha.
<i>- is that all you really want?
- no, no, no</i>
<i>sophisticated lady</i>
<i>i know</i>
<i>you miss the love you lost long ago</i>
<i>and when nobody is nigh</i>
<i>you cry</i>
that was very cool.
what's your name?
i'm sorry?

- uh...
i'm mike.
um, can i get you something to drink?
i used to drink this.
okay. straight?
i thought you're not

i'm not drinking.
you think you're so fucking smart.
<i>and when nobody is nigh</i>
martha.
martha, are you all right?
hey. hey, what is going on?
he's a fucking liar!
who?
we have to leave.
- ok, hey. listen to me. what's going on?
- we all have to leave. i know him.

- what's this?
we have to leave.
you don't wanna live with this.
martha, get into my room.
- let's go into the bedroom.
- please.
what is wrong with you?

do you wanna try to sit up
and drink the tea?
no, i don't need it.
<i>- you okay?
- mm-hm.</i>
you know that death...
is the most beautiful
part of life, right?
death is beautiful
because we all fear death.
and fear is the most amazing emotion of all
because it creates complete awareness.
it brings you to now...
and that makes you truly present.
and when you're truly' present,
that's nirvana.
that's pure love.
so death is pure love.

<i>so lonely</i>

<i>won't you let marlene come in?</i>
<i>the gymnasium door</i>

<i>to tell the truth, marlene</i>
<i>the sound of your tambourine

<i>we were so young then</i>

<i>i would've made marlene let go</i>
<i>my friends in the bars</i>
<i>hell, they only see the scars</i>
