george, come in here, buddy.
come in, come in, come in.
walter, what's going on?
hey, iisten, pull your money out of the bank,
cash in all your stocks and bonds
by 10:00 a.m. monday morning.
why?
well, cnn is doing
one of those investigative reports
about lockwise industries.
that's fantastic.
that'll be great for business.
not really. they're gonna say we've been
running a ponzi scheme for seven years.
well, they can't say that, walter.
that's iibelous.
i mean, this firm's been operating
successfully for over 100 years.
yeah, yeah, they're focusing
on the charity division, helping hands.
helping hands has been going strong
for over eight years.
i should know. i'm cfo.
yeah. yeah, you are.
could you say that again,
the part about the cfo?
i'm cfo. i should know.
right. perfect, perfect. thanks.
walter, are they reporting
that it's our division?
yeah. your division.
but i have all the records.
say that again.
but i have all the records.
perfect. now shred them.
- walter.
- yeah.
what are you saying?
i'm saying that all the monies
that came into lockwise industries'
helping hands charity investment group
are part of a big, old ponzi scheme.
what?
yeah. christ.
it worked for a while.
i almost feel bad for hanging
you out to dry iike this.
you should see your face, dude.
and by the way,
this is not gonna be pretty for you.
i feel awful.
horrible.
what? but...
for me?
you were a iowly accountant, remember?
and then i pull you out of bookkeeping
and make you the cfo.
i mean, you had no experience
whatsoever. none. none at all.
i had worked here five years
prior to that, walter.
- i was working hard. i thought i earned it.
- you did work hard.
nobody earns it around here.
i had to bang my way to the top.
and there's a iot of big women
on the board of directors here.
and that was hard,
and it was hard to stay hard.
so don't talk to me about "hard."
okay? you were paid a seven-figure salary
for exactly this reason.
what reason?
so you could take the fall.
man, you've been paid to be screwed.
kind ofjealous. oh, well.
walter, i knew nothing about this.
yeah, i know. i know. sorry.
would have ruined it if you had, kind of.
well, that explains why i couldn't get
those accounts to balance.
now you're thinking.
what about the charities?
walter, 82 charities.
they think their monies are safe.
i'm handing you over to the feds,
and all you care about
is the stupid charities?
by the way, there's only 12 charities.
there's 82 charities.
no, there's 12. the other 70 companies
were set up by the malone family.
awkward.
the mafia malones?
you've been iaundering money, dude.
yeah, this is gonna be really awful for you.
hey, man, be careful
when you start your car.
this is not happening.
a ponzi scheme? a ponzi scheme?
walter, where are the investors' monies?
walter? walter!
okay, calm down. calm, calm, calm.
calm down.
that's it. that's it.
just calm down.
i'm not calming. i'm not calming.
i'm not calming.
- hey, boss, just the person i wanna see.
- what do you have?
so i've been iooking
into the malone crime family, right?
and the more i iook at them,
i'm finding that they're connected
to this company
that does a iot of charity
investment work, called lockwise.
yes?
i think they may be
iaundering money through them.
- we've been after these guys for years.
- yeah.
why don't you see
what you can find out, okay?
okay.
thanks a iot.
george?
i've been calling you for hours.
yeah, i know. i know.
how is he?
- he was upset, but he'll be fine.
- that's good.
is it true?
what?
come on, george.
don't play games with me.
aii the wives were talking about it
at the field today.
honey,
i swear i had no idea this was going on.
okay? none.
i walked into the office,
and there's walter, and he's saying,
"why don't you shred stuff?
shred whatever you have.
"shred what's in your desk.
just shred everything."
and i'm going, "what's going on?"
and he's saying,
"you're gonna take the fall for this,
"because it's a ponzi scheme.
it's a ponzi scheme, and you're the one.
"you're going down,
'cause you're the cfo."
you know? i mean, they gave
bernie madoff 200 years, honey.
what do you think they're gonna do to me?
what do you think they're gonna do?
and what's gonna happen with the kids?
what's gonna happen?
howie's afraid, you know,
"dad, you missed a game."
i'm gonna miss 38 seasons.
sweetheart, i'm in trouble.
- calm down.
- okay.
- we need to get a iawyer.
- a iawyer.
and then you need to go to your mom's
and go find your mom's valium.
get a valium out of my mom's purse.
- okay. can you do that? like right now.
- okay.
and you need to calm down.
- honey.
- it's gonna be okay.
- it will be. it will be.
- yes.
you know, minimum security.
it's not that bad.
hey, madea.
hey, lorraine, how you doing?
good to see you.
lord, it's a zoo up in there
on the first of the month.

i don't feel iike taking it back.

- you crazy!
oh, my god!
jake!
i'm sorry. take it.
hey, what do you got?
well, just got off the phone with the sec,
and it seems that this lockwise charity
is definitely a ponzi scheme.
coo, one walter burns.
cfo, george needleman.
never heard of him.
let's arrest them both.
well, it turns out
that burns is on a private jet,
according to the faa, to europe.
took off five hours ago.
so i'm sure he's gonna fight extradition.
but our boy, george, now...
boy george? i iove boy george.
karma karma karma karma karma chameleon
you come and go
you come and go
sir?
sorry.
george needleman? our guys should be
knocking at his door at any minute.
great.
well, it'd be great if we could get him
to testify against the malones,
but that may be a tall order.
okay, but no deal for him.
look, i'm tired of these people
sticking it to the poor.
sir, if we don't offer him a deal,
what incentive does he have
to testify against the mob?
it's very simple, brian.
if he testifies,
the malones will probably kill him.
if he doesn't,
he goes to prison for the rest of his iife.
it's a win-win.
sir, i think we should consider...
no, you don't. i want him fried.
now, get our agents there
before the malone family gets to him.
yes, sir.
hi, it's george needleman
calling for jeffrey.
yes, i'll hold.
where are my car keys?
you don't drive anymore, barbara.
i know that.
dad, i wish you could have
been there today.
honey, your dad was very busy.
you suck.
you should probably just give it up.
no, i don't.
yes, you do.
and i just tweeted that.
- dad!
- howie, stop.
your dad's on the phone. eat your dinner.
okay, thank you.
what'd he say?
well, his secretary said
that he would recommend an attorney,
but that he didn't wanna represent me.
after all those years of business with him?
yeah.
what about jeffrey?
nobody's returning my calls.
has anyone seen my car keys?
mom, you don't drive anymore.
is it hanukkah?
no, it's not hanukkah.
yes, it is. that's why that nice young man
asked me to deliver this package to george.
and it's a iong drive,
and so i need my car keys.
mom, who gave you this?
in the backyard,
this man with a shiny, black suit
and black, shiny hair.
george, there's a note.
"you tock from me."
"take," honey. that says "take."
no, i think that's "tock," honey. t-o-c-k.
just read it.
well, the man obviously
needs a spelling iesson,
not to mention his grammar.
can we open the present now?
mom, you know what? let's not open this.
no, this is ridiculous.
oh, my god!
- it's a dead rat.
- i know.
what does this mean?
aii rats die.
oh, my god. george.
don't move. just stay here, okay?
don't move.
stay here.
george needleman?
yes.
fbi. you're under arrest.
no!
i can't believe this.
you can't make bail.
your accounts are frozen, george.
well, here's the thing.
i haven't done anything wrong.
i just wanna go home.
that's not gonna happen.
the malone family
is trying to kill you, george.
we've been given orders
to keep you protected.
what does that mean?
it means you and your family
are coming with us.
we have a problem with needleman.
what happened?
i think malone's boys know
that we're gonna offer him a chance
to testify against them,
so they sent their signature.
is he all right?
yeah, we're getting him out of there now.
good, i'll get on the phone
with the us marshals right away...
no, no. no, no. they can't go
into one of our regular safe houses.
the malones have penetrated
our guys before.
we need to move him some place safe, now
good idea. what do you suggest?
i don't know,
but first thing tomorrow morning,
they're on a plane headed here.
you figure it out and tell no one.
not even me.
sir, i've got kids at my house.
i don't know what i would do
with a whole family of...
i don't know. you've been
a prosecutor for over a year.
this is a big case for you, brian. handle it.
jake.
what you doing here?
you know, i'm just helping your auntie out.
what'd you do?
i tried to rob her.
boy, what is wrong with you?
i thought you gave up the gang banging.
- what the hell?
- i'm in trouble.
my dad put me in charge of
the church's mortgage payoff fundraiser.
i think i may have lost the money.
how?
i invested in some company,
and now they won't return my calls.
jake, come on, man.
i know, and he's gonna kill me!
he just wanted
to pay the church's mortgage off
so that he could retire in peace.
look what i did. and he's so sick.
i mean, those people at the church told him
not to make me trustee of the money.
but you know what my dad did?
"what your dad did, jake?"
my dad went up there and told them
i was a changed man!
you know what else he said?
he said, "everybody deserves
a second chance."
- calm down, man.
- you know? he said, "everybody."
- jake. jake.
- he did that for me.
- and you know what?
- hey, hey, hey.
calm down before madea comes out
and slaps the hell out of you.
look, brian, i need you to help me
get this money back from lockwise.
lockwise industries? new york?
yeah.
that is a ponzi scheme, man.
i don't know how i can help you
get any money back from there.
we're investigating them.
a iot of people invest in these companies,
and those guys live this lavish lifestyle.
they spend all the money,
so there is no money.
and whatever the government can find,
maybe it's pennies on the dollar
that they can get back to the investors.
i don't know how i can help you, man.
brian, i got to get this money back.
how much money you talking?
$114,000.
you were robbing madea? madea doesn't
have that kind of money. what were you...
jake, don't tell me you were gonna rob
a bunch of old women.
how many little old ladies you think
you gonna have to rob to get $114,000?
boy, get your ass off my porch
and go home!
yes, ma'am!
help me get this money back.
oh, man. auntie madea, man.
what am i doing?
hey, hey, madea.
hey, brian. hey, brian.
hey.
i don't know why the hell
you go in the bathroom
and leave the toilet seat up, mabel.
hey, daddy.
do i know you?
i'm past 18 now. you can stop pretending
like you don't know me,
so you don't have to pay child support.
hey, son. how you doing?
i iove you so much. so good to see you.
you want something to eat?
i'm making a sandwich for joe.
i wouldn't eat that, son.
i wouldn't eat that at all.
i believe she be trying to kill me
for my insurance money.
you ain't got no insurance money.
in that case, i'm gonna eat this sandwich
she done made.
i'm not trying to kill you
for no insurance money.
i'm gonna kill you 'cause i want you dead.
i just want you completely dead.
just no iife in you at all. just not breathing.
just maggot food.
here, son, try to taste that for me.
hey, i'm not tasting that. thank you.
what you doing here, son? what you want?
well, i wanted to talk to you, madea. i have...
you want some money or something?
i ain't got no money.
you don't need to be coming over here
asking me for no money.
daddy, i didn't ask you for any money.
good. then ioan me some,
'cause i need a iittle change
for my friday night iights.
what are you talking about?
i be running them hoes, dawg.
i be running them hoes.
shut up, fool.
i ain't got no money either, brian.
what you want? what you come by here for?
well, i came by with a proposition.
i just thought, you know,
you might wanna make a iittle extra money.
you know, the iast time a man told me
he had an opportunity for me
to make a iittle money,
i ended up in mexico,
chained to 20 other women,
walking down the street, just selling myself.
you do need some money, don't you?
yeah, i could always use
a iittle bit of money.
hell, things been tight around here.
i was even thinking about
going back to my old job.
- stripping?
- no.
- hooking?
- no.
- robbing?
- no.
- hit man?
- no.
slinging?
no.
i did have some hustle
back in my day, though.
i was doing a thing.
i was doing a thing back then.
i done got the better now.
good those days are over here,
'cause you too big to be on a pole, mabel.
i'm gonna tell you right now about that pole.
you know, they done switched them.
when you was back there dancing,
they had them telephone poles
you used to swing on.
now, they got them iittle brass poles.
i seen them.
you'd bend or broke one of them.
you'll bend it.
your big ass'll break that brass.
big ass and brass don't mix.
joe, shut up, please. just die.
stop breathing. okay? stop breathing.
i'm talking about going back to work
at an old folks' home where i used to work.
no, no, you don't have to do that.
i got a great idea.
aii right, here's the situation.
i've got five people
that are in a iittle bit of trouble.
one of them is a witness
on a case that i'm working on.
and i was wondering
if they could stay here for a while.
just for a couple of months
until the trial is over, maybe?
here? no.
you better shut that up now.
ain't nobody coming up in here.
hell to the no. ain't nobody...
you better hush that up now.
ain't nobody coming up in here.
- daddy.
- what?
no, that's just crazy.
have some criminal up in this house,
looking all crazy, and police looking...
hell, that's how mabel live every day,
ain't it? that's your iife.
shut up, rectum.
go to hell.
is somebody after them?
yes, ma'am.
but, wait a minute.
i would not ask you to do this.
you're my aunt. i know they'll be safe here.
not one person would know they're here.
this is the safest place for them.
that's some bull.
he's trying to sell you a load of bull.
- what'd they do?
- i can't tell you that.
but i can tell you this. i can tell you this.
you know, you, you pack. you know?
ain't nobody gonna mess with you.
and this is the safest place for them.
you could be like their
witness protector, madea.
look here, don't be trying
to butter me up and all that stuff.
i see what you're trying to butter me up.
yeah, i know i'm packing.
i know i can hold some things down,
but, no, i don't want nobody up in here.
i'm sorry. absolutely not.
i cannot do that. you're gonna have to find
somewhere else for them to go.
the answer's a flat-out no,
and i am not changing my mind.
my no mean "no," my yes mean "yes."
and my "maybe" mean "get the hell out."
i'm sorry.
absolutely not. flat-out no.
ain't gonna happen. get on out of here. no.
too bad, then.
i'll just tell my boss we'll have to find
somewhere else for them to stay.
guess some other lucky person
will make that $4,000 a month.
you know what?
i believe it would be the greatest
christianity thing i could do
to help somebody in need.
so i'm gonna go ahead
and make up these sheets and clean up.
mabel, you know, i believe i'm gonna go
drag that cot out of that garage.
i got a cot back there,
and we can put a sheet up in my room.
we could share, make sure we got
enough room for everybody up in here.
so is that a yes?
ain't nothing wrong with that cot.
ain't nothing wrong with it at all.
got a iittle mold growing in it, but that's
all right. as long as you don't breathe...
where the hell are we?
honey, we are in the south.
yes, ma'am.
and it brings back pretty fond memories.
of what, grams?
a boat and a man, and...
my, he had such a big...
boat.

you do not want none of this.
behave while you're here. if not, you will...
girl, you...

you're supposed to be at home in bed.
i just had to stop by here
to make sure everything's all right.
it's all fine.
i've decided to tell the church
the third sunday i'm retiring.
i thought you were gonna wait
till summer to do that.
no, i can't do that, son. i'm too tired.
it'll sure make the burden so much easier
to know that everything i've worked for
all these years is gonna be iooked after.
i am very proud of you, son.
really proud of you.
don't be proud of me.
are you kidding me?
i have to tell you i'm proud of you.
you know something?
after your mother died,
i wasn't sure you were gonna make it.
you were so far out there in those streets.
but, praise the lord, iook at you now.
helping me run the church,
handling our mortgage payment fund.
no, i am very proud of you, son.
you know, the congregation
is gonna be a iittle bit upset
when i tell them that i'm retiring,
so to ease the pain,
i'm going to tell them that we have raised
the money to pay off the church.
they're gonna rejoice.
well done, son.
yes, sir.
i don't see her out here. y'all come on.
come on. hurry up.
she always nosy as hell,
over there iooking at everything.
hurry up.
- come on. get in the car.
- madea.
madea.
hey, hattie.

and that's all you know?
that's all i know. i swear it.
i don't believe you.
i'm telling you the truth.
you're going to jail for a very iong time.
i can't go to jail. i didn't do anything wrong.
george, calm down, okay?
for what it's worth, i believe you.
oh, boy, somebody believes me.
isn't that wonderful?
let's crack open some champagne,
because somebody believes me.
oh, god, i'm in trouble.
i think they can believe you, too,
but you have to help me make them believe.
just tell me what you want me to do.
what do i need to do here?
okay, that's a good attitude, george.
really good attitude.
everything that wasn't shredded
or destroyed is in these files.
this is your ticket to freedom.
you're the cfo. i'm sure you can find it.
okay, well,
this is the crux of the problem here, brian,
because i can't seem to find anything
in here that will help.
i wanna help you. i really do.
it doesn't make any sense
for me not to wanna help.
now does it? does it? no. no.
i mean, don't you think
i would help if i could?
- are you okay?
- no, i just...
i feel iike i... i wanna hit something.

there ain't never been no evening, iady.
i don't know you.

i'd take people across the water
over there from the bayou to the juke joint,
and i'd charge them a nickel
to get them over there.
and they'd all take the ride and everything.
i'd give them their change.
and somebody gave me a 50-cent tip
that night.
you barbara betty boop.
yes, i was a nurse in company b.
yeah, i was in company c
over there with the colored troops.
me and a couple of my girlfriends followed
you guys all the way to your barracks.

it was blanche, rose, dorothy, and you.
i don't even know
how you remember that, honey.
that was 56, 57 years ago.

because george is 52.
what that got to do with anything?
what day is it?
lady, don't you start...

that child right there. lord, that iittle girl

she has problems.
honey, we all got problems.
that child ain't supposed to be
talking to you all iike that. that is crazy.
what's wrong with that child?
what's she so angry about?
i don't know.
just being here and out of school.
tell that to somebody else, honey.
that child is angry about something else,
and it's deep, whatever it is.
it ain't about no school and nothing else.
this water runs deeper than that.
how do you know?
wisdom. i didn't get this old
by not knowing nothing.
she thinks i'm the reason
that her father divorced her mother.
i wonder where she'd get that from.
are you?
no. what kind of person do you think i am?
a woman.
no, their marriage was over,
her father filed for divorce already,
but she's hated me ever since she met me.
and george just sit there,
don't say nothing?
he just sit there and not say a word?
george doesn't say anything
to anyone these days.
lord, have mercy.
i know. but she needs him.
because her mother, she is so evil.
she filled her head with all these
horrible things about me and about us.
and then, two years ago,
she dropped her off at our doorstep,
hasn't contacted her ever since,
and now she's angry.
and now she's up in my house
and she got me worried.
honey, i'm just worried.
she'll be fine.
i'm not worried about her,
i'm worried about me.
'cause i feel iike i wanna choke her to sleep.
i just wanna grab her
till the iife is out of her sometimes.
she's so flip.
yeah, i get it.
and when she talk back to you,
you just have a iittle argument with her
and you just iet her start her mouth
and say whatever she want to say?
don't do that, honey.
you have to talk to her in a ianguage
that she understand.
you got to iearn
how to start speaking your damn mind.
i speak my mind.
i didn't say, "speak your mind,"
i said, "speak your damn mind."
if somebody do something
you don't iike, you say,
"hey, what the hell is wrong with you?
"you better get your ass together.
this is some straight up bull.
"hell, what is wrong with you?
you heard me? hell."
that's what you got
to say to them sometime.
- okay. i will.
- think about that.
it'll make you feel better.
you'll feel so iiberated.
you're around here doing all that yoda.
honey, you ain't got to do all that yoda.
you ain't got to do not one more yoda.
i'm gonna try that next time.
good. i just gave you some great advice.
you gave me some good advice.
i'm gonna give you some better advice.
white folks ain't supposed to be out here
on this porch
in the middle of the night, honey.
okay.
yep. nope, come on,
iet's go on in the house.
- thank you.
- yeah, you go on first.
any luck?
no, none.
george.
yeah, i know what you're going to say.
you don't think i'm trying.
look at this charity, right here.
okay. i don't really have to iook at it.
hear me out.
listen to what i'm saying to you.
these guys dig wells in africa.
this one, breast cancer.
this one,
they stop sex trafficking of children. okay?
this one, aids research. this one, cancer.
this homeless shelter
is gonna have to close.
george, you got to help me
help these people.
brian, i'm eight years away from retiring,
and now i'm facing jail.
and all these people were hurt
because i wasn't paying attention.
and i was iooking forward to retiring.
spending time with my son.
getting great, big bear hugs
after a good game of catch, you know?
seeing my daughter happy,
content.
i just wanted to iive happily ever after
with my family.
and now, my family's falling apart.
so maybe i deserve all of this, okay?
'cause i can't believe
what's happening to me.
how could i not see this coming?
george, you couldn't see it
because you weren't paying attention.
but now your eyes are wide open.
but none of this makes sense to me.
i mean, i see accounts here and they all start
with a ietter of the alphabet.
"a," "p," "u," "j," "k," "r," "i."
we never use the alphabet
to start accounts, brian.
i don't know what i'm iooking at here.
i really don't.
you can't just keep ietting people
walk all over you.
you were a mark. they set you up.
they thought you were weak.
they did this on purpose to you.
are you just gonna iay down
and iet that happen,
or are you gonna claim your iife back?
prove them wrong.
hit them right between the eyes.
you're stronger than this.
there is a fighter in you, george.
show them. show me.
you can work this out, okay?
just don't give up.
shall we keep digging?
- okay.
- okay.
- okay.
- aii right.

i got something to tell you, honey.
it's awfully bad news.
precious lord...
what?
your daddy died.
what?
he died.
them people that were iooking for him,
they came here and they got him.
and they brought him out there
to the highway,
and they was painting them stripes
on the stone highway, and he tried to run,
and one of them stripe machine
put a iine right down the middle of him.
then the people that was coming
didn't know if it was a passing iane
or high-occupancy vehicle iane.
everybody got confused
and they had a wreck,
and they just ran all over...
about 5,700 cars piled up on top of him.
and kate, she didn't know what to do,
so she went to running.
she just started running as fast as she can.
was running iike wonder woman.
but they had a helichopter
and that helichopter got closer...
and that was it.
no! kate, too?
kate, too. kate, too.
and that helichopter was spinning
and them blades...
where's howie? where's howie?
oh, lord. poor howie.
you know, he tried to run,
but he always have them candy bars
and soda pops in his pockets,
so he kept dropping things and he tripped.
so they put them cement shoes on him
and they throwed him in,
and he's swimming with the fishes.
oh, my god!
my god! i can't believe this is happening.
why you so upset?
what do you mean?
well, you always say, "i hate you. you suck.
shut up. i hate you."
i didn't mean anything that i've said before.
it's too iate now, honey.

- dad!
- honey.
cindy, what's wrong?
she told me you died.

madea, why would you tell her that?
look, this is why i tell her that.
'cause she's sitting around here mad
at everybody and being all nasty and mean.
your parents could be gone at any minute,
then you'll be stuck with somebody iike me.
is that what you want?
to stay here in this hellhole?
i'm sorry.

that's it. that's what she's trying to say,
negro spirituals.
there's a church down on the corner.
they sing negro spirituals on sundays.
why y'all so uptight?
son, will you take me to the negros?
- take you to the negro spiritual, honey.
- spiritual.
right. you can't just say "negros."
them days has passed.
first we were "negros,"
then we was "colored,"
then we were "black,"
now we "african-american."
okay? african-americans.
now singing old negro spirituals.
- spirituals.
- negro spirituals.
- spirituals. spirituals. okay.
- yes, mom. yes, yes.
yes, iet's go.
let's go down to the church.
is it safe?
what you mean, "is it safe," george?
what they gonna do,
stone you with a bible? it's a church.
pretty good.
can i get an "amen" for our choir?
amen!
aii right, well done.
well done.
praise the lord.
praise the lord!
praise the lord. i am so happy, so happy
to be back in the house of the lord
where mercy can be found.
as most of you know, i have
been very sick these past few months.
but by the grace of god, i've recovered.
but i have to tell you something.
i've given a iot of prayer
and i feel it's time for me to retire.
now don't y'all worry, don't worry.
this church will continue,
and its future's guaranteed,
because the church has been paid off.
praise god!
oh, no.
and i was able to pay the church off
because of the investments of my son.
my son.
i'm so proud of him.
son, come on up here
and tell them what you've done.
let us praise jesus
'cause we're all precious in his name.
precious.
precious?
- to all the congregation here...
- precious.
...there's something i need to tell you.
i did invest the money...
precious!
somebody's got the holy ghost.
i know!
- you know?
- i know!
the same know that i know?
i know!
that man knows!
- you know?
- i know!
- how much do you know?
- do you think that he knows now?
- i'm not hot, i just know.
- praise the lord!
yes!
aii right, george, you want to try
to explain this to me?
yeah.
there was a woman
named precious jackson
that walter always told me about. okay?
now i've iooked at these accounts
and they all start with a ietter.
the ietters spell out "precious jackson."
it's all encrypted, right here.
what the hell are you talking about?
the ietters spell out...
okay, i'm a iittle confused
by this, too.
it's the name the account is in.
okay.
just follow this, 'cause it took some doing
to follow the money trail
from the cayman islands and germany.
but the trail goes cold when the money
goes into a swiss account. okay?
now, they were all given a ietter
when they went in and came out.
- right?
- okay.
but every month on this date,
as the funds go into this swiss account,
this account in the us sees a deposit.
now i balance the two, and it's exactly 10 %
that resurfaces in the us
in this account every month
to a iady named precious jackson.
what is 10 % gonna do?
of 600 million?
that's six million!
jake.
it's 60 million.
- sixty.
- sixty.
george.
i can get the church's money back.
- praise god.
- yes, you and all the charities.
- can this really work?
- yes, it can work.
why would walter take this money
and put it in an account with
some woman's name who never touches it?
well, either he didn't tell her about it,
or she doesn't exist.
so what i'll do is i'll get a federal warrant,
we'll get the account seized.
i'm pretty sure once i bring this to the judge,
you'll be able to get probation.
that's a great job.
but, brian, we can get this money
back to the people it belongs to.
it's sitting right here in this account.
you didn't just say that to me.
i'm an officer of the court.
i don't even know what you're thinking.
i didn't hear that.
i don't even want to know
what you're thinking. no. no, no, no.
- brian.
- not having this conversation.
- i'm out of here.
- please. come on.
- i will see you at the office tomorrow...
- brian.
...bright and early, george.
- thank you so much.
- brian. please.
bye.
i've come too close to give up now, okay?
i'm not calling it quits.
i'm gonna get that money
back to the charities.
right? i want my iife back.
and here is where i start to take action.
so you're either with me or you're not,
but i'm not giving up without a fight.
so what's it gonna be,
mr. i'm-a-tough-guy-from-the-hood?
mr. you-going-down-homie?
'cause i'll tell you,
i'm gonna do the damn thing.
so you're with me or what?
i'm with you.
- gucci!
- yeah.
with you.
you okay?
i will be.
george, what's going on?
i screwed up, that's what's going on.
and now there's a big wrong
that i have to right.
and i just have to figure out
how i'm gonna do it.
but i'm gonna do it. i am gonna do it.
george, i haven't seen this much fire in you
since we got married.
well, maybe it's iong overdue, huh?
do you remember
our honeymoon in florence?
- i remember it rained every day.
- it did.
and do you remember, you said,
"what if our marriage is
nothing but full of rainy days?"
i might have been joking.
but i remember
you still got upset, didn't you?
- i did.
- yeah.
and what did you say?
i said,
"rain does make things grow."
exactly.
what if all this happened for a reason?
for you and i
to get to know each other again,
for our family to get closer, for us to grow?
what if it did?
kate, you are amazing.
i swear to you, i'm gonna make things right.
i have no doubt.
honey, you always do the right thing.
i iove you so much.
i iove you, too.
i'm so proud of you, george.
that's good.
i'm closing an account.
rita, it looks like you'll be
withdrawing $4 million from us today.
$4 million?
- is that correct?
- yes.
well, how would you like that?
hey, son. we watching ghost.
she's gonna walk up in a bank
and act iike she somebody else.

and pretend to be precious jackson?
is that right?
yes.
does brian know anything about this?
- no.
- he thinks you both could go to jail.
well, i could be going to jail anyway.
that's all right. just don't drop the soap,
you'll be fine.
i been up in there. you might have to
fight a iittle bit, kick a iittle ass.
but you'll be all right.

i don't feel good about this.
i just don't... i don't know. i don't know.
