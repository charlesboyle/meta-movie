<i>that's my brother, gary.</i>
<i>he's the best friend
you could ever have.</i>
<i>yeah, i know what
you're thinking.</i>
<i>we could be twins.</i>
<i>smalltown...</i>
<i>...the best town you
could ever grow up in.</i>
<i>gary and i did
everything together.</i>
<i>and, as the years passed, my
brother was always there for me.</i>
i got it! gary, throw me!
throw me!
aaah!
<i>we were a great team.</i>
- nice job, walter.
- thanks, gary.
<i>oh, don't get me wrong.
it's not perfect.</i>
<i>- that was so fun!
- nothing is.</i>
sorry, kid.
- i wanna do that again!
- come on. i'll ride with ya!

<i>even the sunniest days can
have a few clouds in them.</i>
ride's bogus, anyway.
hey, wanna rent a video?
yeah. race you home!
<i>and, well, that night sorta
changed everything.</i>
<i>it's the muppet show, with our very
special guest star, mr. steve martin!</i>
<i>i found them...</i>
<i>the muppets.</i>
<i>i guess you could say i was
their number one fan.</i>
oh, gary, it's an entire
map of the muppet studios.
<i>and they made all
the difference.</i>
<i>- trick or treat!
- because from then on...</i>
- hey, guys.
- oh, hey, gary.
- hey.
- hi-ho, guys. yay!
is that kermit the frog?
what is this, 1978?
<i>...even on the worst
days, i knew...</i>
<i>...that as the years passed...</i>
<i>cancel that last remark.</i>
<i>...as long as there are singing
frogs and joking bears...</i>
<i>...swedish chefs and
boomerang fish,</i>
<i>the world can't be such
a bad place after all.</i>
all right, good night, buddy.
oh, good night, gary.
<i>and as long as there
are muppets...</i>
<i>- ...for me...
- ...hair-growing tonic.</i>
<i>...there's still...</i>
<i>- ...hope.</i>
aaah. bye-bye!
<i>somebody get him!</i>
animal. hey, animal, come on.
the show's about to start.
show! show!
<i>hey, walter, why
don't you join us?</i>
<i>come on!</i>
no! wait! i want to be with you guys!
please let me in!
kermit!
whoa!
walter, are you ok, buddy?
you're drenched in sweat.
did you have the dream again?
ummm. no. hey, so when are
you guys leaving today?
oh, um, just a couple hours now.
oh, wow, gary, i think it is so cool
you're taking mary to los angeles.
i can't believe you guys have
been dating for ten years.
i know. yeah, she wanted to do something
special for this anniversary,
and she's always wanted
to see los angeles, so...
hey, don't forget to send me a
postcard from the muppet studios.
oh, yeah, i'm sorry.
- i can't do that, walter.
- but, gary...
because...
you're coming with us!
qh, gary!
- but what about mary?
- she's fine.
- she said the more the merrier.
- <i>i...</i> i don't know what to say!
the muppet studios are there, gary.
i can't believe this!
better get a move on.
we don't want to miss that bus!
no way! who knows?
maybe kermit will be there.
i wouldn't get your
hopes up, buddy.
the muppets haven't put on
a show together in years.
i don't think they use the studios
for anything but tours any more.
nah, i think that's
just an internet rumor.
like there's a country
called turkey.
walter, how many times do
we have to go over this?
- turkey is a very real country.
- wow, muppet studios.
- i can't believe it!

hey, gary, what should we
do first at muppet studio?
cause i was thinking that maybe we
could start at fozzie's joke room...
oh, no, wait, wait, wait.
the lines might be shorter at
honeydew's laboratory of fun
so maybe we should start there instead i just...
i just can't wait!
oh, walter, don't be nervous.
oh, i know.
i just can't believe i'm here.
the home of the muppets!
what...
what happened to this place?
where...?
- where is everyone, gary?
- i don't know, buddy. it's so...
ok, well, i guess you
guys are it for today.
anyway, welcome to the
original muppet studio,
where dreams can come true.
- is this the universal studios?
- yes, it is.
ok, now if you'll just
follow me, please.
ok. this used to be
kermit's office.
- whoa.
- mm-hmm.
it's really the
highlight of the tour.
you should see it sometime.
ok, this next building is
where they kept the rope
and the medium-gauge wire for the productions.
let's go take a look.
- come on, buddy.
wow!
oh, boy.
oh.
whoa.
there. now this here is
kermit the frog's old office.
- or so we've been "toad."
well, as you know, gentlemen, i've
loved the muppets since i was a boy.
and what better way
to honor the muppets
than to make this beautiful
studio a muppet museum.
i think i'll call this room
the "kermit the frog's
old office room."
- oh, that is lovely.
- oh, good one, mr. richman.
now, this here is the standard
"rich and famous" contract
kermit signed 30 years
ago, that contains...
- the deed to this property.
- exactly.
now, this contract is 100 percent
ironclad, with one minor exception.
if the muppets can raise the ten
million dollars it would cost
to buy the building before
this contract expires,
- then they get their studio back.
- you know, if i didn't know better,
i'd say you were reciting some
sort of an important plot point.
well, i hope so. otherwise, i just
bored the audience half to death.
you mean half the
audience is still alive?
it's nice doing
business with you.
- yes, sir. come on.
- goodbye.
i love geriatric humor.
gentlemen, there's oil
under this studio.
- yeah, i can smell it.
and more importantly, the geological
survey says there definitely is.
in two weeks, we tear
this place to the ground
and start drilling.
ah, those muppets
they think they're so funny.
well, it looks like the
joke's about to be on them.
- maniacal laugh.
maniacal laugh.
maniacal laugh. maniacal laugh.
- maniacal laugh.
- walter!
- walter?
- walter!
- walter!
yeah, so then, when he thought
they were alone, he said,
"there's oil under
this studio, see.
i'm gonna tear it
to the ground, see.
- sweet, sweet oil, see!"
- people still talk like that?
maybe that's just how
he sounded in my head.
either way, we've got to find kermit!
he'll know what to do.
how do we find kermit?
nobody's seen him in years.
stop the car! i've got an idea!
mmm.
these are delicious!
- great idea, walter.
- mm-hmm.
we've been doing this
for a long time.
i think maybe we should
call it a night.
guys! - we can't give up, gary.
but it's getting really late.
maybe we should just go back to the motel.
- guys!
- it...
- what?
- what?
- maybe he lives there.
- oh. that's it.
so, what do we do now?
i don't see a doorbell, and
the house looks empty.
- gary, throw me over.
- what?
- gary, just throw me over already!
- ok.
- ok, here we go. <i>ok...</i>
- one, two, three.
- that's good.
- sorry.
- no, it's good.
- guys?
i think that's an
electric fence.
mary, it's kermit the frog.
- ok, buddy, head down.
- one, two, three!
- it's an electric fence.
- yep.
oh, my gosh. walter? walter, buddy?
walter, can you hear me?
throw me again. - no, i don't...
i don't think
that's a good idea.
- what kind of throw was that?
- i think there's somebody coming.
excuse me...
you ok? that was quite a tumble.
oh. look, look. i think...
hey. hey, walter?
- walter, you all right, buddy?
- where am i?
ok, this is awesome.
we're at kermit's house.
- oh, jeez. walter.
- no, no, no, no, no. you ok?
this... this is kermit's house?
- anyhow, how can
i help you guys?
let me just say, this is an honor
for all of us to meet you, sir,
but my brother, walter, has some
really disturbing news for you.
- good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
- not now, 80's robot.
might i offer you a drink? tab?
good grief. - new coke?
listen. not right now,
bummer.
watch out for the...
- gag me with a spoon.
yeah, head for the door.
- grody to the max.
- ow.
ow.
- i'm really sorry about that...
...walter. what were you saying?
- yes. tex richman, the oil baron, <i>is...</i>
- yes, yes, yes.
oil baron tex richman, the
wealthy philanthropist.
you know, he's about to buy
our old muppet show theater
and turn it into a muppet museum.
isn't that great?
- no! i mean...
- what walter's trying to tell you
is that tex richman has a secret plan to
tear down the theater and drill for oil.
- what?
- the only way to save the studio
is to raise ten million dollars.
ten million dollars?
that's impossible.
- but...
- the only way to raise
that kind of money
would be to...
...would be to put on a show.
and i haven't seen the old
gang in a long, long time.
i guess people soft
of forgot about us.

- no, the other gift.
- ice cream?
- no, no. after that.

the third greatest gift ever!
kermit, your fans never left you,

all you need to do
is show 'em again!
hmm.
i don't think so, guys.
don't you see, kermit?
it's time to play the music.

- well, yeah, listen.
if i'm gonna do this, i'm gonna
need some moral support.
well, that's perfect.
we're experts at moral support.
- yeah!
- good. i guess if we're gonna go,
we better get going.
we got a lot of people to find.
oh, great!
but wait, how do we find 'em?
didn't you see our first movie?
we drive.
- so where do we go first?
- i shall take the liberty
of using my modem to
locate the muppets.
- ok.
- great
- oh, stop it!
in the name of all that's
sacred, let it end!

- hi-ho, kermit.
kermit? what are you doing here?
well, <i>i...</i> i just want to
tell you that was a great show.
it was... very informative.
i do my best to keep
it fresh each night.
- oh, yeah.
- oh, i'm fozzie, by the way.
oh, i'm sorry.
this is gary and mary.
and this here is walter.
he's a personal friend.
- yeah.
- so i said, "what are you looking at?"
so i punched him in the face!
i mean...
- let's talk in my dressing room.
- sure.
- ok.
- here we are.
make yourselves at home.
- wow.
this is not quite
what i expected,
- based on your christmas cards.
- oh, yeah. about that...
oh, but it's nice, and...
and airy.
maybe we should give
them some space.
i know, but i wanna hear
what they're gonna say. ok.
sixty-four shows nightly
can get pretty grueling.
fozzie, an evil oil baron wants to
tear down our old muppet studio.
- what? oh, no!
- i mean, that's a shame.
step out of the vehicle!
hey, fozzie...
i'm sorry i haven't
been in touch more.
it's fine, kermit. look at me!
living the dream!
- uh-oh.
oh, no! not this again!
- quick, save the cushions!
- the cushions?
i'm sorry, fozzie.
if i'd known you were
here in this place...
that's all right, kermit.
it's not your fault.
- we had a good run.
- yeah.
yeah, it's just that...
well, we haven't seen each other
in a really long time, and i...
i just thought maybe we could raise
the money to buy the theater back
if we all got together and
put on one last show.
a show? but i've spent years
building a solo career.
i have a whole new show-biz
family that loves me.
fozzie! what the heck are
you doing, hibernating?
next show starts in 30 seconds.
we hired you, and we can fire you,
so get your butt in here now!
- they terrify me. let's go.
- let's go.
- watch out for the forklift, fozzie.
- oh, thanks.
wow! gonzo's doing really well!
according to 80's robot,
he's the richest plumbing
magnate in the rust belt.
you! order 28,000 tons of
plumber's putty from beijing.
right away, sir.
- and, you, send the 28,000 tons
of silly putty back to beijing.
you bet. - oh, and you?
a memo to the waterless
toilet department.
i don't care about the
mess, just keep trying.
- hi, gonzo.
- kermit? fozzie? this is a surprise.
- we need to speak to you.
- all right. have a seat.
ah. thank you!
- i think i'll stand.
- no, really, you should try one! comfy.
it's our executive
line of used toilets.
anyway, i'm very busy.
i've got 30 seconds. go.
uh... gonzo, i'm not quite
sure how to say this, but...
don't forget to mention
the evil oil baron.
yes, fozzie, i was about to.
just give me a moment, ok?
gonzo, it would appear...
remember, evil oil baron.
fozzie, i'm going to get to that.
please!
- as i was trying to say...
- evil oil baron.
- ok, time's up.
thank you, guys.
gonzo, we're trying to get the
old gang back together again.
- we really need you.
- my answer is no. good day!
come on, guys. we should go.
i just want to say, when i was
a kid, i saw you recite hamlet
while jumping your motorbike
through a flaming hoop, and...
...it made me feel like
i could do anything.
thank you. yeah.
- good try, walter.
- hey, guys, up here!
- ya-haa!
- huh?
i've been wearing this under my
suit every single day for years!
look out below!
whoa, where you going?
you threw me off-balance!
i can't see! apollo 13!
citizens of earth, the
great gonzo is back.
i pledge never to
hold a plunger again!
run! run! run for your lives!
run, run, run!
- run, guys!
- run!
oh, my gosh, run everybody!
it's gonna be big!
it's gonna be a big one!
wow! that was an expensive
looking explosion!
i can't believe we had
that in the budget.
so maybe if you look
inside yourself,
the person you should be
most angry at is you.
is you.
how have you been feeling?
any more control issues?
in control.
- good. psst. animal!
excellent. - it's me, kermit.
hey, we're having a meeting here, man.
you're being really rude, frog!
pardon us, please.
animal, i need to talk to you for a second.
we're getting the muppets back together.
we need you to drum again.
- animal drum?
- yes!
- please, sir.
- drum! drum, drum!
- drum, drum, drum!
- ok, ok.
- in control.
- good.
i'm animal's
court-appointed sponsor
we don't use the "d-r-u-m" word.
- it's his trigger word.
- his trigger word?
excuse me, mr. black.
i'm so sorry to interrupt,
but it's very important to these
guys that they get their drummer...
gary!
it's my trigger word, too.
jack, we talked about
this on tuesday.
tuesday's another one
of my trigger words!
oh, i don't think so!
sorry.
- let's go, animal.
- bye-bye!
- animal, heel.
- go, animal! be free, man!
but remember! no drumming!
mr. kermit, may i suggest
we save time and pick up
the rest of the muppets
using a montage?
great idea, 80's robot.
we greatly appreciate
your financial support.
eighty-seven point three miles to go.
eighty-seven point two...
have to do that?
...the secrets of
the universe...
i guess we're in.
<i>welcome to this week's edition
of "everything stinks."</i>
whoa!
bye, lisa.
off to the ted conference.
three, two, one.
think we should've
rented a bigger car?
hey, wait for me!
i wanna help save the studio!
i wanna go with you!
oh, not again.
wow. i can't believe
we're all back together.
even all you guys who
weren't in the montage!
yeah, how come you didn't
use me in the montage?
i thought my story was
pretty interesting.
- rowlf?
wanna get back together?
- ok.
- good.
classic.
anyhow, looks like
we got everybody,
so we can plan our telethon and
raise that ten million dollars.
- well, not everybody.
- no, i think everybody's here.
- where's...?
- all good!
- miss...
- all done here!
- piggy?
kermit, we're going to
get miss piggy, right?
ok, ok, ok, you're right.
we'll go get piggy!
my minitel tells me she
is in paris, france.
oh! well, then we
drive to france.
- you can't drive to france, walter.
- yeah. it's way too far.
then maybe we should
travel by map!
- good idea, fozzie.
- yeah!
to paris!
paris! paris!
look at these ceilings!
yeah.
they must be very tall here.
yeah, very nice.
uh... hi there. excuse me.
miss? pardon me, ma'am?
hi there! we're here to see
miss piggy, and it's urgent.
urgent! urgent!
- is it urgent?
- very. yes.
let's have a look then, shall we?
she has an opening in...
- ...early september.
- early september?
that's like six months from now!
that's nothing.
once i waited a whole year for september.
she is the plus-size editor.
she's a huge deal and extremely busy.
you can't just pop in
without an appointment.
- ok, then.
- thank you.
- all right.
- mean lady.
- close the door on your way out.
- thanks a lot.
- she wasn't very nice.
- yeah.
guys! muppet man!
- yeah!
- that could work!
hello.
i have an appointment.
oh, ok.
<i>um...</i>
will you wait here a moment?
decisions, decisions.
- eeny, meeny, miny, mo.
i choose you.
- mademoiselle cochonnet?
- can't you see i'm busy?
- of course.
there's a...
man here to see you.

- ahahaha.

hello.
- whoa.
- what the...?
- sorry.

- you look familiar.
- so do you!
please, have a seat.
yes, we're going to
have a seat now.
- no, no, no, don't sit down!
- oh, sorry! whoa!
uh-oh.

- ohh!
i can't believe i
fell for muppet man.
- you guys ok?

kermit?
- hello, piggy.
- kermie!
oh, kermie, kermie, kermie, kermie,
kermie, kermie, kermie, kermie, kermie!
mm, mm, mm. kissy-kissy.
mm, mm, mm!
wait! what am i doing?
i promised myself i'd never go back!
i am woman! i am strong!
you must leave at once!
- ok.
- no, no, wait, wait!
miss piggy!
the muppet studios are in danger.
in danger? our studios? kermit!
it's true, piggy. and we need to
do the <i>muppet</i> show again.
we need you.
oh.
before i decide anything, i
need to talk with you, frog.
alone.
piggy? last time we were together,
i said some things i regret.
no. no, kermit.
you were just being honest.
you never intended to marry me.
not even after i
built us a house
where we could raise tadpoles
and grow old together.
well, who do you think's been looking
after that house all these years, huh?
piggy, why do you have to always
be so overdramatic about things?
you know, it leaves me no choice
but to do things that hurt you.
i am who i am.
why can't you accept that about me?
look, this is not
about you and me.
it's never about
you and me, is it?
it's always we.
we this, we that.
"we" need you. you can't even
say, "i need you," can you?
piggy...
i'm sorry, kermit, but
i have a life here.
a life i've made for myself.
piggy!
just remember, kermit,
i cannot be replaced.
kermit? what happened?
where's miss piggy?
- she's not coming, fozzie.
but, kermit, we always
worked together.
we can't do this
without miss piggy.
no one will give us
a show without her.
we'll be fine, fozzie.
we'll be fine.
we just...
we'll just have to come
up with something else.
kermie.
ok, i've got an idea.
we need a pig that can sing.
but, kermit, who could
possibly replace miss piggy?
hey, what's everybody
so quiet about, huh?
- well, she's sorta like miss piggy
- come on, everybody.
let's go pitch our telethon and
get the muppets back on tv, ok?
- no.
- no.
oh, my goodness!
oh, that's wonderful!
that means no.
- come on, guys.
- awkward.
listen, kermit, i like you.
i remember you guys
from when i was a kid.
- so i'm gonna shoot straight.
- you guys aren't
famous any more.
i wish she'd shot a
little more curvy.
take a look at this diagram the
research department drew up.
this circle represents everything
that's currently popular.
and this tiny speck is you guys.
so the answer's no.
it's not gonna happen.
take a look at the shows that are popular now.
<i>punch</i> teacher.
<i>- oh! i love that show.
- it's time to punch teacher!</i>
<i>- finish him!
- it's my favorite.</i>
<i>i just thought i could
make a difference.</i>
i'm sorry, but in this market, you guys
are no longer relevant. have a good day.
before i go, i'd just
like to say something.
i think kids are smarter and better
than all this junk, and if you...
veronica, bad news.
<i>punch</i> teacher has stopped production.
it's being sued by the
teachers society of america.
- what's their problem?
- no idea. i just found out.
what are we supposed to do with
that 120-minute black hole
in the schedule coming
up in two days?
ok, muppets.
you've got yourselves a show.
- all right!
- oh, yes!
thank you so much.
you will not be sorry, i promise, i promise!
ok, enough! one, no more going nuts in my office.
these are new carpets.
- yes, ma'am.
- and two, you need a celebrity host.
ok. whatever, whatever.
come on, guys, let's go. yeah!
- let me wipe that.
- you've missed a spot.
- i don't see it.
- just a little lower!
- oh, i am so sorry. did i get you...
- yes.
well, gentlemen.
it appears we have some competition
on the muppet propel“iy-
the <i>economist</i> says they've
gotten back together again.
- the muppets got back together?
- remember?
<i>♪ together again gee,
it's good to be... ♪</i>
gentlemen, please!
no singing in my office!
- yes, sir.
- but, of course, it was all his fault.
- mostly his fault.
- no matter.
point is, that studio and
that oil belong to me.
yeah, those muppets are gonna be
running home with their
tails between their legs.
some of 'em literally.
because those ones have tails.
maniacal laugh, maniacal laugh.
that's a maniacal laugh moment.
ok, this is it.
<i>it's the muppet show,</i>
<i>with our special guest
star, mr. bob hope!</i>
<i>time once again for
veterinarian's hospital,</i>
<i>the continuing story of...</i>
<i>and now, pigs in space!</i>
gary. can you believe it?
- the muppet theater.
- yeah.
- welcome back, everyone.
- thanks.
well, i know the old place is not
quite at its best right now.
yeah!
who cancelled the maid service?
but don't worry. we'll be fine.
kermit, there's no way we can
rehearse with the place like this.
wait.
kermit, don't say another word.
mary, walter and i, well, we would be
happy to help you rebuild the theater.
honestly, it would be an
honor for all three of us.
- so would.
- ok. well, let's clean this place up!
yeah!
- this is boring.
- but don't you guys remember?
you're the muppets!
you do this to music!
well, all right!
- hey, animal!
- yeah?
look what i found!
- beauregard!
- scooter! good to see you!
where's everybody been?
celebrity... celebrity!
hello! yes. could i speak with
president carter, please?
he moved? well, you don't happen to have
a number where i could reach... hello?
walter, i thought we were
gonna clean the balcony.
- doing a great job, pal.
- you're doing a great job.
- wocka wocka.
- hey, guys!
look at these old
photos i just found.
oooh.
can you believe that 80's
haircut i used to have?
i looked totally ridiculous!
yes, it's kermit. the frog.
could you come to our celebrity
telethon this weekend?
sure. sure, i understand.
- hey, shut the door!
- what is that?
say hello to the little friend.
there goes dinner.
wow! great job, everybody!
oh, hey, kermit.
listen, have a great night,
and i just want you to know, walter
and i are really good sewers,
so we'll have those costumes
ready for you in no time.
- good. you two have a great night.
- ok. thank you!
- bye.
- kermit?
gary, i was kind of hoping that
we could go to the beach tomorrow
- or see the hollywood sign.
- we'll have plenty of time
to do that stuff.
it's just, right now,
i don't wanna leave walter.
you know, he needs me.
i don't know, sweetheart
he seems pretty happy.
- like that.
- oh, ok.
now you.
yeah, that's it!
yeah, yeah, good job!
well, just one more day, ok?
and then i'm all yours.
tell you what. why don't you get a
head start on sightseeing tomorrow
and then i'll be waiting
for you when you get back.
ok. just...
don't forget about me.
never.
well, we're still on for
dinner friday, right?
yeah, of course.
- oh, walter!
- oh, yes, kermit.
hey, listen, walter, i
just wanna tell you
that none of this would have
happened without you, so thank you.
- oh, well...
- and welcome aboard.
night, everybody.
just sleep anywhere you can find a spot.
"welcome aboard"?
hey, kermit. you awake?
- yep.
- what's the weather
- supposed to be like tonight?
- i don't know. why?
i just don't want it to rain
through the hole in the ceiling.
stars sure are pretty, though.
we're gonna be ok, right?
we haven't done this in a long time,
and i really don't
wanna go back to reno.
don't worry, fozzie.
we'll be fine.
look how we cleaned this
place up today, you know?
same old team, all
pulling together.
i guess you're right.
night-night, kermit.
good night, fozzie.
ok, gather round, troops!
everybody, time to get this rehearsal going.
- scooter, is everybody here?
- almost everyone, chief.
- yeah...
- hey, anybody got any kerosene?
i wanna take these old pig
dresses out back and burn 'em.
hold it right there,
sausage snout!
- piggy?
- huh?
well, look what the
cat dragged in.
come on. keep it up, maurice.
sorry, miss piggy, but you've
been replaced... permanently.
- oh, yeah?
- yeah!
i don't think <i>so...</i> sister?
who you calling sister, sister?
- oh, look, an omelet station!
- oh, where?
- hiya!
there's only one miss piggy,
and she is <i>moi.</i>
yeah, well, you ain't seen the last of me!
i'll be back!
yeah, yeah. heard of mouthwash?
- welcome back, miss piggy.
all right, all right,
don't crowd me!
wow, she sure hasn't changed.
piggy? you came back.
i'm not here for you, kermit.
i'm here for them.
and, besides, when
this show's done,
i'm catching the next plane
back to my life in paris.
ok, piggy, ok. places for the
opening number, everybody!
oh, good morning, veronica.
- morning, frog.
- ok, everybody, take it from the top.
- oooh!
- you missed your cue.
- i know!

no drums! no drums!
- jack black said no drums!
- animal, heel! sit!
- who's next? oh.
- in control.
- hey, walter?
- oh. yes, kermit?
you think you might
wanna help us out here?
- maybe do something
in the show?
kermit, you know, you've
been so nice to me,
but i have to face the facts.
see, the muppets are so talented...
hey, guys, check it out!
fart shoes!
- patent pending!
- and...
<i>...l</i> don't have
any talent at all.
the truth <i>is...</i> i
can't perform with you guys.
i feel like a phony
just being here.
walter, just because you
haven't found your talent yet,
doesn't mean you don't have one.
if you look inside yourself,
i'm sure you'll find something
that you're really good at.
ok, kermit. i'll try.
take my picture!

no, it's just me. party of one

- ok, cue 17 is fozzie's intro.
- hey, scooter? what's left?
oh, uh, it's you, chief!
- hm?
- your duet.with piggy.
- miss piggy?
- hm?
we're all out front
practicing our acts
and seems that everybody expects
you and i to do a duet, so...
oh, that's so lovely,
but i'm afraid i can't.
no, no, you see, i'm already doing
a duet with my new dance partner.
hola.
ok, come on, rehearsing, let's go.
we gotta break it up.
- excuse us.
- 'scuse us.
let's try that lift
again, shall we?
the lift again.
ok, on my count this time, ok?
- in three, two... wait for me!
good grief.
kermit! there you are.
i've been looking for you everywhere!
so nice to see you, veronica.
who's hosting?
did you find a celebrity?
yeah, well, i've wanted to talk to
you about that, you see, because...
well, actually, i'm
kind of a celebrity.
you?
no. kermit, listen.
i will not air the show unless
you find a real celebrity host.
i will rerun <i>benson</i>
if i have to.
yeah, you see, the
thing is, veronica,
that's kind of impossible
because the show's in 12 hours!
twelve hours!
i might as well just go and ask tex
richman to give us the studio back!
and the muppets are like a big family.
well... and for us,
that theater <i>is...</i> is like our home.
which is why, in conclusion...
<i>...we</i> humbly ask that
you give us back our studio.
it would certainly
mean a lot to us.
hmmm.
well, mr. the frog, let me see.
correct!
the answer is no.
well, you could've
just said that.
- contract.
- contract.
contract.
- nicely done, sir.
- you see, muppets,
according to this contract,
it's not just this studio you
lose the rights to tonight,
- it's the muppet name itself.
- what?
and all characters
under the muppet name.
wait a second. what possible use
could you have for our names?
told ya i'd be back.
well, now i am...
...back.
and i see you've met mr. richman
our new business partner.
the moopets are a hard, cynical
act for a hard, cynical world.
hey, fozzie!
i want you to meet a friend of mine.
- wocka wocka.
- you're relics, muppets!
the world has moved on,
and no one cares about
your goody-goody, hippy-dippy, julie
andrews and dom deluise hostin',
singin'-and-dancin' act any more!
you're dead!
- and i just come to bury you.
now, get out of my office.
- what?
- what is that supposed to mean?
you said you were gonna
talk to the man!
guys! ok, so maybe kermit
signed away the theater
and the muppet name, but as long
as we have a celebrity host,
we can still pull off a heart-warming,
last-minute triumph, right, kermit?
well, actually i don't
see how we can, fozzie.
- huh?
- what?
guys, the show's in six hours,
and we're barely rehearsed,
and, well, <i>i...</i>
i couldn't get us
a celebrity host.
- oh, no!
- what?
i'm afraid tex richman's right.
the world's moved on.
i'm sorry i dragged you
guys into this mess.
kermit?
all right, listen
up, you freaks!
i didn't come 5,000
miles to not be on tv.
all we need is one stinkin' celebrity,
and by any means necessary.
now, the frog's gone.
we're doing things my way from now on.
let's move!
- hey!
- hi.
- how was your day?
- oh, it was great.
i went to guinness book of
world records... alone.
then ripley's believe it or not...
solo.
and then i ate lunch
unaccompanied,
and then i walked back here...
independently.
listen, i got you these.
you know, to make up for the other ones.
the broken ones.
thanks, sweetie.
listen, gary.
i was just wondering what the
plan was for dinner tonight.
oh, i don't care.
what do you feel like?
ok. that's fine.
that's just fine. that's...
that's perfect.
i'm going to go for a walk.
- individually.
- walter, hey.
- gary.
oh, where have you been?
i need you to help me figure out a talent.
a talent for what?
for the show. kermit asked
me to do an act in the show.
<i>i...</i> i could be a muppet.
wow.
wow, walter, that's amazing.
yeah, but i need to figure
out if i have a talent.
well, you know what?
i'm sure you'll think of something,
but right now i actually...
i need your help.
i'm starting to get the feeling that
mary's upset with me about something,
and i don't know what, and i was hoping
maybe you would talk to her for me.
gary, i'd love to help you out,
but i can't leave the theater now.
this is important.
well, hold on a second.
i mean, my life is important, too
yeah, but the whole reason we
came here was to see the muppets.
no, it wasn't!
the whole reason we came here
was to take a vacation where i
took mary out to a fancy dinner
because it's our tenth
anniversary, and then...
- walter, what day is today?
- friday.
yeah. yeah, that's it.
this is bad. walter, this is really bad.
i have to...
- mary? mary!
- wait.
gary, i need you.
ok, is everybody ready?
commence operation celebri-nap.
masks on!
- masks on!
- except for <i>moi.</i>
nothing covers this
beautiful face.
no maskin'? - no maskin'.
check the door on stage 28.
<i>- i'm going over there now.
- she's done in makeup...</i>
i told you, i'm not done
putting on my balls!
oh, hey, animal.
what are you doin' here?
acting. natural.
now!
whoa!
- hiya!
hiya!
mary, surprise!
i figured out why you're mad... at me.

agreed to do the telethon!
oh, my gosh, that's amazing.
where is he?
- in the trunk.
- get me outta here!
you kidnapped jack black?
that's illegal!
but, kermit, what's more illegal,
briefly inconveniencing jack black,
- or destroying the muppets?
- kidnapping jack black, fozzie!
kermit, listen.
whatever i may think of you right now,
these guys are counting on you.
you inspire them.
- what, to kidnap people?
- to work together.

i don't really know who you guys are
my agent just told me to show up.
- that's great.
- are you one of the
teenage mutant ninja turtles?
yes, i am, and let me show
you how you can help.
and don't worry.
it's just your one shot to go on live tv
before millions of people to
prove you have what it takes
to become one of the muppets.
good luck.
up next, folks, i am proud
to present a brand-new act
to the show. introducing walter.
that's not good.
it appears that walter has
stepped out, so it's...
well, it's back to the days of
yore down at the old barbershop.
oh, no! it's a barbershop quartet!
get me out of here!
wait a minute.
what are you doing?
is that nirvana? stop it! no!
you're ruining one of the
greatest songs of all time!
ow!
careful around the ears!
ah! that was hot!
hey! what's going on here?
why is my body so big?
<i>what'd you do to my voice?
i sound like a chipmunk!</i>
wait a second.
did you guys shrink my head?
ladies and gentlemen,
jack black!
nice work, everybody.
chickens, you're up next!
it's going rather nicely.
we might just make this
and now i am pleased
and proud to present
those princesses of poultry,
camilla and friends!
let's hear it for camilla
and her farmyard friends!
no, i... i don't know why
i'm not hosting this.
so remember, folks, keep on calling
and you'll help us reach our goal
of ten million dollars by midnight.
and if...
oh, dear.
ladies and gentlemen,
don't be alarmed.
we will get this sorted out just
as soon as we can. scooter!
well, that's that.
nice try, muppets!
kermit, how are we going to
raise the rest of the money
with no electricity?
all right, calm down, everybody.
- is everybody ok?
- yeah.
well, we can't do the
show without power.
- anybody got any bright ideas?
- not now, fozzie.
ten-gauge gator grip.
i love it when you talk shop.
oh!
<i>♪ la la la la la la
la ♪ mee mee mee mee</i>
what?
how'd they get the power back?
we're gonna have to
get up on that roof
and shut 'em down for good!
bolt cutters!
bolt cutters.
deadly! you come with me.
that's it.
hm.
to the end of the muppets!
deadly! what are you doing?
enough!
just because i have a terrifying
name and an evil english accent,
does not preclude the
fact that, in my heart,
i am a muppet, not a moopet!
looks like it's i who
will have the last laugh!
- what does that mean?
- it's an idiom, you idiot,
because you cannot laugh! ha ha!
- oopsie.
deadly.
now that's a maniacal
laugh for you!
hey, gary, mary, how'd you
guys get here so fast?
we travelled by map.
we thought it'd be quicker.
hey, i'm sorry i bailed.
i just...
i realized you don't let
the most important person
in your world slip away.
- hey, scooter?
- yeah?
could you do me a favor and
take over hosting duty?
but, chief, i don't go onstage.
well, just do what i do.
pretend that the audience is naked.
<i>yeah, but, i...</i>
<i>ha...</i> ha... ha...
uh, miss piggy?
- you are all naked.
well, sorta.
ok. great!
and now, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome, a real hero...
you saved it?
after all this time?
oh, kermie.
i guess i'm not that good at
saying this kind of stuff.
- yes, kermie?
- well...
...over the last week,
i realized that...
i miss you.
and i need you.
and maybe you don't need the,
the whole world to love you.
maybe you just need one person.
it's time for our song, and if we
don't raise the money tonight,
it might be the last
time we sing together.
and... well, are you ready?
oh, kermie.

ladies and gentlemen,
it's almost midnight and we haven't
quite reached our target yet,
but if you'll all just stick around,
we'll be right back with our final act.
the muppet telethon <i>will</i>
return after these messages.
walter?
walter, where are you, buddy?
listen, everybody, the show ran short,
and we don't have anything else planned.
we need one last act
to bring us home.
i'm gonna go check on jack black
and see if he has any ideas.
you guys see if you can
come up with something.
we have two minutes!
two minutes!
- think, think, think!
- what am i thinking?
walter. walt!
- walter!
- gary?
- wha... you came back.
- walter.
what are you doing down here?
they just need one more act.
you gotta get out there and help those guys.
i can't. what if people laugh at me?
<i>i...</i>
i'd rather go back home to smalltown.
with you.
look, walter, you're my brother,
and i'm always gonna love you, but
you belong here, with these guys.
hey, you're the one who
got kermit to do this.
you're the one who brought
everyone here together.
you always believe in other
people, but that's easy.
sooner or later, you gotta
believe in yourself, too,
because that's what
growing up is.
it's becoming who
you want to be.
you have to try. please, walter.
you're my hero.
ok, jack black's got nothing.
what did you guys come up with?
- bunsen can set beaker on fire.
- no, no, no, we can't do that.
- i could break out the fart shoes.
- no, no, no, that will never work!
<i>we're back in three, two...</i>
oh, no!
it's walter.
thank you.
- he's all grown up.
- oh, that was wonderful!
ladies and gentlemen, walter!
it looks like we're going
to get our studio back!
the muppets are about to
take back their studio.
help! i've been mugged.
alerting authorities.
<i>we're sorry...
- what happened? hello?</i>
- hello?
- guys, my phone is dead.
my phone is also dead.
repeat, my phone is also dead.
ooh...
i did it. i beat you.
game over, kermit. you lost.
chicky!
too late, muppets. i won!
turn that thing off!
- the show is over!
but we were so close!
or not.
it kinda makes me feel
better, honestly.
i mean, we were
nowhere close at all.
you artists formerly
known as the muppets
are standing on
private property.
my private property
and i'm telling you to leave.
now!
he's right, everybody.
he won. we gotta go.
not now, fozzie.
- i can't believe this.
- i know.
well, that's that.
this isn't right.
it can't end like this.
but what can we do?
listen, everybody, we've got nothing
to be ashamed of. and you know why?
well, because thanks to
walter here, we tried.
and if we failed,
we failed together,
and to me, that's
not failing at all.
and i don't care what
anybody <i>says.</i>
and i don't care if no one
believes in us, because i believe.
- i believe in you.
- huh?
- and you.
- me?
- and you.
you know, what's important
isn't this building or a name.
it's each other. so i say, fine,
let's just start at the bottom and
work our way back up to the top.
yeah.
- let's all walk out through these doors
with our heads held high.
as a family.
- because that's what we are.
- yeah. yeah.
muppets, muppets, muppets!
wow.
muppets, muppets, muppets!
all right.
- wow.
- wow.
- hey, where's walter?
see?
your fans, they love you guys!
hey, walter.
aren't you gonna join us?
- yeah! come on!
- come on, walter!
- come on, walter!
- yes. come!
what're you waiting for, buddy?
get over there.
yeah, go ahead.
muppets! muppets! muppets!
muppets! muppets!
hm? oh.
how charming. a finale.
