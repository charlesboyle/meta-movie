<i>and now back to
jim carr's sports talk.</i>
hi, jim carr again.
denis, i know that some in our audience
don't know the finer points of hockey.
could you tell them,
for example, what is icing?
icing happen when the puck
come down, bang, you know,
before the other guys,
nobody there.
my arm go comes up, then the
game stop, then start up.
i see.
what is high-sticking?
high-sticking happen when the guy
take the stick, and he go like that.
you don't do that.
you don't do that?
oh, no, never, never.
why not?
against the rules. you know,
you're stupid when you do that.
just some english pig
with no brains, you know.
what is slashing?
slashing is like that,
you know.
and...there's
a penalty for that?
yeah. and for trip also,
you know, like that.
and for hook like this.
and for spear like that.
all bad.
you do that,
you go to the box, you know.
two minutes by yourself,
and you feel shame, you know.
and then you get free.
the chiefs are at home tonight against
hyannisport at the war memorial at 8:00.
good seats
are still available.
<i>a look at sports.</i>
i think that went well.
<i>at defense for the chiefs,</i>
<i>number 5, billy charlebois!</i>
<i>at center for the chiefs, number
dunlop, you stink!
<i>at left wing,
number 10, ned braden!</i>
i hate you, braden!
<i>playing right wing,
number 14, jean-guy drouin!</i>
frog pussy!
<i>ladies and gentlemen,
our national anthem.</i>
go get them, kid.
hey, denis!
how's it going, nick?
i'm drunk.
nah! i'm not bullshitting ya.
got shitfaced on the bus.
louise left me,
and that son of a bitch
keeps playing me
when he knows i'm shitfaced.
geez, i'm really sorry.
anybody throws me against the boards,
i'm gonna piss all over myself.
take it down
to the other end, ned.
i thought i'd get jerry one of those
"great ideas of the world" sets.
you can look up the ideas alphabetically:
arts, mechanics, philosophy.
yeah. johnny always says you can just
screw so much and drink so much.
he's screening me!
move him out!
we got charlestown
trailing three to nothing
with 10:48 left
in the first period.
oops! correction, folks,
that's two to nothing.
we don't want to make it any tougher
for the chiefs than it already is.
that's what
you're paid for, braden!
try winning a game
for a change.
nice going, kid.
<i>announcer.' number 10, braden,
with his 18th goal of the year.</i>
<i>assisted by number 7, dunlop,
and number 14, drouin.</i>
<i>ned braden is now the leading
scorer in the federal league.</i>
tie it up out there, guys!
come on, defense.
get the puck outta here!
hit him, billy,
hit him!
with us in the press box is injured
chiefs' defenseman dave carlson.
dave, is it tough sitting up here
watching your team lose like this?
definitely, jim.
you injured your knee
in the peterboro game.
no.
no? i thought you had.
no, i have a cold. the runny
nose, sore throat, all that.
i went out in that storm last
week to start my car.
i didn't have my jacket on.
it may have settled
in my kidneys.
we got action here.
hit him with your purse,
ya pussy!
jesus, look at brophy.
he's plastered!
he told me so!
if anybody boards him, he's
gonna piss all over himself.
piss all over himself.
<i>faire "pipi," eh?
no, no, i okay.</i>
clear the puck, billy!
get this guy outta my crease!
joe mcgrath. oh, yes, miss!
get off the ice, nick.
you're gonna kill yourself.
they're on the ice right now
giving their all.
they will be ready.
ensemble number 32,
entitled "omar sharif"
and modeled by chiefs'
defenseman billy charlebois
who hails from, if i can read the
card, moose jaw, saskatchewan.
notice the padded shoulders,
giving the '40s look.
you look nice,
real spiffy.
keep in mind that the perfect
accessory for the man in your life
is a season ticket
to the chiefs games.
i look like some cocksucking faggot!
you seen reg or braden?
joe, enough's enough.
nowhere in my contract does it say
i gotta make a fool outta myself.
have you seen dunlop or braden?
i'm gonna flash them, joe.
i'm gonna walk down
that aisle,
open this bathrobe
and wiggle my dick at them.
you will not. yes, lam, joe.
you know why?
because i want you to have
a heart attack and die
so we never have to
do this again.
you and your fucking fashion show!
it's good publicity.
you fellas have not been drawing them
in the way you have in the past.
i'm gonna wiggle it at them,
you cheap bastard.
you better be prepared
'cause when i yank it out,
everybody in that audience,
with the exception of my wife,
is gonna be running
for the exits.
ensemble number 8
as we watch chiefs'
defenseman johnny upton...
joe mcgrath here.
just checking on dunlop...
we have two generations
of pro hockey with us
for you folks to call in
and question.
player-coach reggie dunlop
and right wing ned braden.
reggie, you represent
the old guard,
one of the iron men
of the federal league.
you've been playing pro hockey
for how many years?
quite a few, jim.
is that right'? and on the other
side of the scale, ned braden
who's a college graduate,
and an american citizen!
you went to princeton
and were all-eastern.
that's what it said in
the yearbook, jim. okay.
our lines are open.
anything you folks wanna know
about the fascinating world
of pro hockey, here we go!
hi, there. jim carr.
what's your question?
<i>dunlop,
you old fan', why don't you
get outta the game and let...</i>
we... we're gonna spin some music while
we're waiting for our next caller.
jim, i know a lot of kids
would enjoy coming to the games
to see a great veteran
like reggie dunlop skate.
while we're waiting
for our next caller,
we'd like to remind
you folks calling in
to keep your questions within
the boundaries of good taste.
what kind of broad is it who calls
up and <i>says</i> something like that?
they're supposed
to be our fans.
just 'cause we're losing...
who cares? it's over.
idiot mcgrath and his shitty p.r. schemes.
i hate that cheap bastard.
what are these poor fuckers gonna
do when they close the mill?
they ain't
closing the mill!
they're just jacking the guys around
so they'll feel happy they got jobs.
it's the old tactic,
the mind-fuck.
announced it this morning.
april 1, they shut it tight.
yeah?
yeah!
that's a big surprise.
ten thousand mill workers
have been placed on waivers.
what the hell are they
gonna do with them?
i don't know.
every sucker for himself.
hey, who's she?
slipped my mind.
oh, yeah? maybe
your wife'll remember her.
you're the best girl in
the whole world. yes, you are.
ruby! how's my ruby?
how's my girl, huh?
you're a sweetheart. i missed you.
you're a sweetheart.
are you my girl?
beginning to like it here, huh?
no, i hate it here!
i'm cracking up.
you know what i mean?
you don't look bad.
i can't figure it out.
i'm slipping fast.
i think you look fine.
slow down.
you're making her nervous.
- jerry, i'd like to cancel the order.
- joe?
and there's another matter that's
come up and is kinda important...
would you hold it a minute?
joe, what happens to us
when the mill closes?
don't worry about it.
in on the 4:15 bus.
i wanna know
what happens...
who are these guys?
i never even heard of them.
son, just pick them up and
take them over to the hotel.
i've done enough shit work.
the fucking fans are calling
in with dirty talk.
nothing in my contract
<i>says</i> i gotta...
do you see this quarter?
it used to be a nickel. now, the
golden years are behind you.
one season, maybe two,
you'll be hanging up the
blades and retiring the ax.
fuck it. then you'll
remember it was joe mcgrath
who trained you
for the front office.
i'm sorry, jerry. like i say,
i'd like to cancel the order.
in fact, i've got some
equipment i'd like to sell.
skate sharpener, massage
table, jacuzzi, our bus.
<i>transways express flyer,</i>
<i>number 83 for pittsburgh,
cleveland...</i>
hey! hey!
hey! you guys the hanson's?
fucking machine took my quarter.
who are you?
reggie dunlop, the coach.
grab your frigging gear
and let's get going.
okay. c'mon, steve. let's go.
took my quarter!
<i>you think they show
speed racer here?</i>
hey, guys!
hey! wait up. hold up.
look what i got!
you guys triplets
or something?
no, i'm in the middle.
steve's 20, jeff's 18.
where are you from?
iron league.
the iron league, huh?
lotta fights?
nah.
hey, i want a soda!
we paid for you here for a week, then
you gotta find a room of your own.
okay, coach. gimme a grape or an orange.
none of that root beer!
we go on the road tomorrow...
- we're on the road in the morning.
- i don't want any...
the bus leaves the war
memorial at 8:00 a.m.
i gave you a quarter
at the bus station.
well, will you give me
another dime?
i'm saving the dime
to call mom.
jesus christ.
you cheap son of a bitch!
are you crazy?
those guys are retards!
i got a good deal
on those boys.
the scout said
they showed a lot of promise.
they brought their
fucking toys with them!
i'd rather have them playing with their
toys than playing with themselves.
they're too dumb
to play with themselves!
every piece of garbage that comes
on the market, you gotta buy it!
reg, that reminds me.
i was coaching
in omaha in 1948,
and eddie shore sends me this guy
who's a terrible masturbator.
couldn't control himself.
he would get
deliberate penalties
so he could get into the
penalty box all by himself,
and damned if he wouldn't,
you know.
oh, joe, jesus.
what was his name?
move back. there you go.
number three.
<i>no one can take your place</i>
<i>if you get hurt

"to see the three chiefs
make a scoring rush,
"the bright colors
of their jerseys
"flashing against the milky ice was
to see a work of art in motion."
that's good writing, dickie.
i was trying to capture
the spirit of the thing.
oh, you did.
want a beer
to go along with that?
it's ridiculous
for us to be here.
we stick out like a couple
of sore thumbs.
i'm doing what i like.
it's making you crazy too.
you're turning into a zombie.
you told me so.
i don't wanna have
a fight again.
"rookie goalie denis lemieux
"continuing his brilliant first
season with the chiefs..."
my father'd give you a job.
your father'd give you a job.
i'm all for that.
always good to have choices.
i just wanna get out
of this goddamn dump!
you take the van.
i'll keep the dog.
hey, lily! come on...
what's the matter with her?
you're bullshit!
you're really bullshit!
you're drunk!
you're right,
he's bullshit.
yeah'? well, he and i are the
only decent items in here.
why should she give a shit what
other people think of her?
she's just scrapping!
my heart goes out to her.
you guys gotta stop losing.
get the power play together.
we're working on it.
is he nice to her?
yes. he love her!
he tell me, "i love her!"
god, maybe braden's a faggot.
ever think of that?
you crazy! he has a big
cock like a horse!
you think that lady in the red
dress will go home with me?
no, she's not your type.
how much?
five dollars she don't
even look at your face.
<i>aha, ha, aha</i>
<i>you've got
a cute way of talking</i>
<i>you've got the better of me</i>
<i>just snap your fingers
and i'm walking</i>
francine, you look terrific.
you're right.
you've been had.
that's his wife.
so, how's your money
holding out?
there's a beer in
the fridge if you want one.
is that a new dress?
sort of.
looks good. kinda tight.
i think i'm gaining
a little weight.
i don't know. maybe
it's better tight. maybe.
is that the first time
you wore that dress?
been going out?
getting around?
been seeing somebody
in that dress?
making out?
that's none of your
business anymore.
jesus christ, francine. i
think about you all the time.
nothing is ever over.
if i wasn't so goddamn busy,
i'd see more of you.
i was gonna come down the
other night and ask if you
wanted to go to the aces.
but, i don't know,
something came up.
what?
you need dough?
save your money, reggie.
you're gonna need it.
who me?
the minute they close the mill,
the chiefs are gonna fold.
that's bullshit.
these people
are gonna be broke.
they're not gonna be going
to hockey games.
and you're not getting
any younger.
i've got nothing
to worry about.
i coach. i got experience.
you're no good at it.
every player on that team
thinks i'm the greatest.
what?
you're a losing coach.
you can't make them win.
ah, geez.
i was thinking about you
the other day.
i was trying to imagine you
when you were through with
hockey, and i couldn't.
there was nobody there.
what are you gonna do?
i'm gonna come back to you!
too little too late.
hey, charlie!
ned? ned!
i underlined
the fuck scenes for ya.
get back in the van. you're
gonna catch pneumonia.
go on back to the van
'cause you're gorgeous
and you're gonna
catch pneumonia!
go get her, billy.
back in the old iron lung.
she underlines
the fuck scenes for ya?
she underlines
the fuck scenes,
she must worship
the ground you walk on.
they teach you how to
underline in college.
not the fuck scenes,
they don't.
braden, you gotta learn
to put out more.
you know what i mean?
holy mother of god! ned, are
you seeing what i'm seeing?
hey, billy.
jesus, it's finally happened.
hi, guys.
how ya doing?
they're horrible looking!
don't look at me. it's
mcgrath's doing, not mine.
what'd the old man trade
for these assholes?

i think
it's a fucking disgrace.

he's gonna do something.

mcgrath's in there trying to
get himself anotherjob.
fucking team's folding.

she had her jugs up
against my suit.
nipples as hard <i>as</i> little rocks.
right, morris.

<i>look into the camera
and say hello to anybody.</i>
<i>i'd like to say hi to all
the guys at work if i can.</i>
put my fucking car back
on the track!
one more lap! hi, coach. hi.
two nothing. two nothing.
brought your cars with you, huh?
we're on the road.
all set to go.
tell us when.
oh, i'm shuffling
lines around.
i'll let you know when i
get it straightened out.
okay, coach.
see you later, coach.
five nothing.
the thing's not working! i quit.
i don't wanna play no more.
you broke the darn car.
how am i supposed to play?
you are the first man i've slept
with since i left hanrahan.
oh, suzanne,
a beautiful woman like you?
i've been sleeping
with women.
are you shocked?
no.
did you ever want to
sleep with a man? no.
never?
no!
i don't blame you though. i mean,
women's bodies are beautiful.
but men's bodies,
i see them everywhere.
in the locker rooms,
cocks all over the place.
do you wanna know how it happened?
no. that's okay.
no, that's all right, 'cause i
have to tell it in court anyway.
every time hanrahan
went out on the road,
i would go over to this wife's
house and we would get drunk.
we would talk about how depressed and
lonely we were without the guys.
every week...
then, one night we were talking
about how we hated the life,
and how we had never done
much of anything ourselves.
i don't know why, really.
we were like kids. we started
playing with one another.
we were drunk as usual.
and the next week
we did it sober,
and it was terrific!
at the end of the day, i think
about women, about women's bodies.
maybe all that will change.
maybe i'll wind up sleeping
with old goalies.
things being what they are,
who knows?
when hanrahan found out
about it, he went crazy!
he said if i was a dyke,
that made him a queer.
and he started slapping me around.
i ended up in the hospital.
jesus! yeah. i'm on the lam.
i'm hiding out.
we play him next week,
you know.
oh, god. i got so sick of those games.
they seem so childish.
the chiefs are folding.
the mill's closing
and the economy and stuff.
i just found out about it. i
don't know what i'm gonna do.
christ, a handsome man
like you, reggie?
it ain't easy.
i don't see myself in one of those
bullshit 9:00 to 5:00 jobs.
you could get traded. suzanne,
i ain't a rookie anymore.
so far <i>as</i> the coaching goes,
the chiefs are...
hey, use your imagination.
that's what i've been doing.
look at me!
here i am a no-good,
runaway hockey wife.
a dyke?
yes.
turn it off!
i hate it!
i hate it. turn it off! don't
touch that television set!
i'm sorry about
the chiefs, reg.
i'm doing a tribute
to the team on sunday.
"chiefs fold. a sad commentary."
somewhat along those lines.
dickie?
huh?
something's afloat. on the q.t.,
i think they're gonna sell us.
it's hush-hush and i can't
name names, but let's say
that there's
a senior citizens' community in
the market for a hockey team.
the chiefs?
actually, it's florida.
they're getting a bunch of old
geezers from the northeast.
and what do you think those old
geezers really miss in florida?
i think there are a lot
of shysters in florida.
hockey. their own team.
a saturday night game.
hell, those poor old people, they
gotta have something to root for.
you're a pussy!
daddy, he called me a pussy, and
then he changed the station.
don't bother your daddy now.
work it out amongst yourselves.
so, now...let me
get this straight.
a retirement community
has bought the chiefs.
oh, no! no.
i said negotiating.
that's not much to go on!
dickie, they've already
built the rink!
they've dumped
a lot of capital into this.
what they're really looking for
is a cheap deal on a team.
and since we ain't exactly
the boston bruins...
how could anybody in his right
mind buy a fifth-place team?
that situation is gonna be
changed, i guarantee you.
come on, watch your wing!
hey, hanrahan!
hanrahan?
cover the point! goddamn
it, cover the point.
come on, mo!
give it to them!
it's along the boards.
nail him! nail him!
hanrahan,
suzanne sucks pussy!
get him the fuck
outta there, will ya?
behind the net!
hanrahan, she's a dyke!
i know! i know!
take it out!

gotta think about retiring.
i know all the other teams
laugh at me.

they're all mine.
don't admit to nothing,
you guys!
dickie, it's me, reg.
they're putting the hansons
away on a trumped-up charge.
someone threw a monkey wrench.
hit jeff in the face.
no, they were defending the honor
of charlestown at the time.
the boosters are behind us
a hundred percent.
dickie, have you
seen francine?
sergeant, you will never meet
a greater champion
of the pure sport of hockey
than me.
sergeant, i knew eddie shore
and toe blake...
you guys back there?
peterboro lost tonight, so <i>as</i> of
right now we're in the play-offs!
i would like to see the bail
just a little more reasonable.
joe, hurry it up. i wanna go home.
sergeant, when is the trial?
you can't leave those guys in there.
they're folk heroes!
they're criminals. most folk
heroes started out as criminals.
you're asking an exorbitant sum.
joe, i got it here.
how much these goons gonna cost?
$250 for each.
this young fella
is in a hurry
because he's got the prettiest
wife waiting at home.
but she ain't happy.
sam, let them out.
i want a receipt.
hey, hey, there!
hey, coach.
we got to keep our bracelets!
thanks a lot, sarge.
let's get on the bus.

the boys and i want you to
have this as a little memento.
it's a chiefs' key ring.
you can't buy these in stores.
guys, we'll party in there!
aren't those hansons
something?
they're sort of funny looking.
real funny looking.
they're probably
real good guys.
underneath. they couldn't
be <i>as</i> dumb as they look.
yes, they could.
they're just goons.
johnny doesn't care
for the fighting.
he told me so.
that's bullshit.
if we weren't so far
below sea level,
the radio reception here
would be much better.
i'm getting tipsy! i've been
shitfaced for the past week.
i only drink
in the afternoon.
or before a game...
or when johnny's away.
me too.
if i'm not tight, i can't stand it.
that's terrible!
<i>it's sad, so sad
so sad</i>
<i>it's a sad, sad situation</i>
<i>and it's gettin'
more and more absurd</i>
<i>it's sad, so sad
so sad</i>
<i>why can't we talk it over?</i>
<i>oh, it seems to me</i>
<i>that sorry seems
to be the hardest word</i>
how ya doing, lil?
hey, johnny.
hey... lil? lil!
hiya! let's go someplace.
ya know the aces?
bully!
can the heavy stuff.
let's start something.
get the fuck out,
i'm going home!
oh, yeah?
where's braden going?
i got a better idea.
let's die in bed.
you're nuts.
jesus. you really married a weirdo.
he don't run with the traffic.
speaking of weirdos!
me? i'm normal.
yeah? well,
then normal is fucked.
how come you talk dirty?
'cause my family has money.
leave him.
my wife left me.
i was driving her crazy!
all she could do
was drink and cry like you.
every time she sees me,
it drives me nuts
'cause i know
she's asking herself,
"how'd i get mixed up
with a bum like him?"
good question!
oh, yeah?
next year you'll be
asking yourself
the same question
about braden!
he treats you like shit.
he told me the only reason
you paid attention to me
was to make him crazy
so he'd fight.
yeah! that's part of it.
but mainly it's because
i think you're a champ.
only you gotta stop
killing yourself.
my place.
that's a coincidence.
get out!
hey, you gotta
roll with it, kid.
use your imagination.
that's what i've been doing.
i can get ya straight.
beat it.
well, i'll see you later.
hi, guys. i'm proud of ya.
they're talking about you
in the streets!
coach, you want a white avenger?
nah. gimme a cup of coffee.
that was a nice tribute
to the guys, dickie.
i tried to capture the
spirit of the thing. yeah.
hey, guys. this is dickie dunn.
he wrote the article on ya.
hi, guys. nice to meet ya.
i was trying to capture
the spirit of the thing.
hi, guys-
hi, guys-
hi, coach.
hey, come out and see
the game tonight.
compliments of the chiefs.
thanks, reggie.
you too.
free tickets! sure,
spread them around, guys.
compliments of the chiefs.
thanks, reggie.
you really taught that guy
a lesson last night.
he was sensational!
i guess that was a big fight.
are you in pain?
no, it hurt like hell!
oh, you poor thing.
look, i'll make you
a double dose of this stuff
and you won't feel anything.
good.
what happened to you? he got
that in the fight last night.
that is a very deep cut.
will you be
at the game?
if i see you in the stands, it
make me feel better... a little.
hey, killer!
get them tonight!
fucking wearing me out.
reggie!
hiya, honey! how are ya?
you look
a thousand years old.
it was along bus ride.
did you listen to the
game last night?
of course not.
we got a whole new attitude.
it's bringing us success!
any fool can fight.
no, i swear to ya.
the chiefs are gonna be
sitting pretty in florida
when this town's
a stinking memory.
i've personally been talking
to the owner,
which is why i've been
too busy to call you.
every waking hour, i'm on
the phone making deals...
reggie, i'm moving.
what?
to long island.
a gal who works in a shop
there has a space open.
<i>business here is just dead.</i>
are you really going?
you know, we have to get
divorced one of these days.
i mean, i could meet somebody.
you could meet somebody.
yeah?
well, don't look so sad.
it's gonna be a big one!
see those guys...
reggie, look, i'm late. i'll
write you when i get settled.
hey, i'll try to call you
before you go.
it sucks! no, son, it looks
nice and it sells hockey.
it ain't mean enough.
put some blood in there.
show somebody getting hurt.
a groin injury!
put the map of florida
in the background.
get some tits in there.
put a "for sale" sign
on the bottom.
i don't want any tits and i
don't want any "for sale" sign.
<i>jesus.</i>
remember that great
peterboro game in '68?
yeah. what about it?
jacky st. pierre's wife
left him.
it was snowing like hell before
we even got to the motel.
yeah.
jacky had a whole keg sent in.
poor jacky. he had a future.
i told him to watch that
drunk driving!
my god, joe,
did we ever get shitfaced!
and jacky was running around
telling everybody
he was gonna get jill back
even if he had to beg her.
i told him not to do that.
oh, i think he should've.
she was a dynamite broad.
god did we get shitfaced.
i liked jacky.
yeah, he could've been great.
yeah.
remember i went
to your room afterwards
and you were dressed
in chick's clothes?
yeah, you had on this
black bra with tassels.
you were dancing in front of a mirror
with this zebra-skinned jock strap.
remember how i screamed at you
when you started coming on to me?
i said, "jesus, stop it. i'm
ashamed of ya." damn you.
i wanted to tell you
i forgot the whole thing.
years have passed now.
i'm sexually liberated.
i don't care
who's a fag no more.
i mean, who cares? it's natural.
it's all around us!
who's the owner, joe?
he's probably
calling florida.
see how the sale is going.
i was in florida once
on a southern tour
where i met
this little redhead
who's an underwater
specialist.
<i>and the
first thing she says to me was,</i>
"come on out by the pool."
so i went out, and she comes
leaping out of this cabana,
wearing nothing but this
little see-through wet suit.
reg, i want a chair
by the pool!
i want some snatch
by the pool.
reg, you want a coke?
no, i can't. i'm taping an
interview at the station.
they're playing it
at 4:00. don't miss it.
that was some road trip.
six straight wins and a whole
new rash of penalty minutes.
we got
a whole new attitude.
what about the hanson brothers?
what about 'em?
they're not just bullies?
what do you mean,
"just bullies"?
they scare the bejesus
outta everybody.
deliberately?
i'd like the folks
to come down
and watch us cream them punks
from syracuse.
anything new on the sale
of the chiefs?
i think the negotiations are,
you know, going pretty good.
i have
a personal announcement.
i'm placing a personal bounty
on the head of tim mccracken.
he's the coach and chief punk
on that syracuse team.
a bounty?
yeah.
a hundred bucks
of my own money
for the first of my men
that nails that creep.
that's 8:00
at the war memorial.
the syracuse and the all-new
charlestown chiefs.
thanks, reg.
not to worry, kid.
<i>i'm placing a personal
bounty on the head of tim mccracken.</i>
<i>he's the coach and chief punk
on that syracuse team.</i>
<i>a bounty?
yeah.</i>
<i>a hundred bucks
of my own money</i>
<i>for the first of my men
that really nails...</i>
yeah?
are you nuts?
<i>bullshit.
a bounty?</i>
we could all end in the
clinker for this!
big deal, joe.
you can't put a bounty on
a man's head! i just did.
yeah?
reg, it's killer.
oh, hi, killer.
i want that $100. well, you
gotta earn it, killer.
my attitude's right.
okay, kid.
in-fucking-credible!
who is it?
yeah?
hi!
oh, hi.
what's up? oh, jesus.
come on in.
well, i did it. you bet you did.
you did, you bet.
the wedding presents my side gave.
fifty-fifty, right?
can you get my clothes?
yeah, sure.
jesus, did you
write him a note?
oh, do you think i should've?
i don't know.
he's gonna think
the worst.
hey, lily, we're gonna have a ball!
we are?
except right now
i gotta take a nap.
i put a bounty on this guy's head.
if i don't get some shut...
if i don't get some shut-eye, i'm gonna
get murdered out there on the ice.
otherwise, you know, i would've
given you a night on the town.
we could've gone
to the aces.
she won't mind.
she's great to sleep with.
ned sleeps with her
before every game.
her breathing makes him
feel more secure.
reg, i'm gonna get
a grip on myself,
start using my imagination,
go with the traffic.
i've been going about this all wrong!
i probably am terrific.
you want some spaghetti?
reg?
run the siren.
what?
run the goddamn siren.
i'm paying for it.
let 'em know there's
gonna be blood in there.
i can circle, but it's
gonna cost you more.
for chrissake!
there.
don't ever play
<i>lady of spain</i> again!
jesus christ.
hey, mccracken!
dunlop, you suck cock.
all i can get.
<i>one hundred dollar bounty</i>
<i>on the head of famed syracuse
stickman, tim mccracken.</i>
<i>mccracken, also known as dr. hook for
his scalp-like prowess with the stick,</i>
<i>has been known to carve a man's eye
out with the flick of the wrist.</i>
<i>there's a carnival-like
atmosphere here tonight.</i>
<i>the crowd has gathered.
you can feel it.
there's an air of expectancy.</i>
<i>syracuse skating out now.</i>
<i>we're looking forward
to a real contest tonight.</i>
<i>we'll be ready to face off
at the middle circle.</i>
the referee <i>is</i> ready to go.
the linesmen for tonight...
go, chiefs, go!
go, chiefs, go!
a hundred bucks says you're
gonna crack my skull, huh?
i wouldn't crack your knuckles
for a hundred bucks.
so he's bluffing?
somebody's gonna kill you,
you dumb son of a bitch.
but it's not gonna be me.
good pass!
come on, ned, hit him!
what's the matter with you?
you're a chief!
come on!
you son of a bitch!
get over here!
you chicken-shit, yellow-belly...
i just scored a goal!
they don't want you
to score goals.
they want blood.
they're booing you.
go get 'em, killer!
come on, you son of a bitch!
come on!
come on, killer. we win
'cause i score goals.
kiss my ass! we win
'cause i make 'em crazy!
come on, nail him!
you don't make me crazy. i
will, 'cause you're benched!
you want ice time, tell me when
you want to play it my way.
you're the biggest pussy in the league.
that's right! i like pussy!
yeah? that's not what i hear
from your wife. i hear...
go get him, killer!
real old-fashioned guts
for dave "killer" carlson
to jump into that fight
with tim "dr. hook" mccracken.
ned braden's come
into the booth.
<i>i noticed a
discussion with reg dun/op.</i>
have you been benched?
yes, a first in my
professional career.
why is that?
i won't fight.
you could play if you fought.
let's just say i'm chicken-shit.
<i>ned, tell me.
why would someone</i>
with your family background
and education
still be playing hockey?
i hate my father.
i'm also having
a lot of problems at home.
you are? i just said
i was, didn't i?
they're sexual problems.
i'm perverse.
<i>i come here to get
away from my wife!
holy shit!</i>
this is jim carr...
we fight day and night.
she wants me to quit hockey.
you may have noticed, she's the only
good-looking piece of ass in charlestown.
she also has
a drinking problem.
at this moment,
i have no idea where she is.
gimme that goddamn mike!
why do you wear that rug?
it's sensationally ugly!
you're going bald!
can't you face up to that? at least
i'm not chicken-shit like you!
what you're hearing is the truth.
jim carr got angry!
joe mcgrath here.
the boys like to horse around.
chicken-shit bastard.
sawed-off old fart!
i may be bald, but i'm not chicken-shit.
i wanna talk about violence.
chick, chick, chick!
gimme that!
son! son! son!
hey. billy!
well, you're gonna
be set, lily.
taking your destiny by the throat.
you're in the driver's seat.
you're not having second
thoughts about this, are you?
sometimes i think i get it, and
sometimes i think it's horseshit!
to doubt is human. you stick with reg.
i'm on a roll.
bye, francine. come back and see us.
i will. thank you.
you're gonna need
another 10 or 15 minutes.
hiya!
hi.
this is lily braden,
ned braden's wife.
actually,
she's on waivers.
she's in the market
for a perm.
i said, "there's no one
better than 0l' francine."
well, i don't think...
the works! i'm buying.
i'll pay you back tomorrow.
no, that's not the problem.
see, the problem is...
i never laid a hand on her.
she's just a kid.
it's a pathetic story.
it's pathetic.
you look terrific.
be careful, girls.
<i>there's tv radio mirror
or modern screen.
you were married to him?</i>
for about a hundred years,
but it's all over.
he's completely
off his rocker.
i left my husband, too.
really?
i'm only halfway out the revolving door.
you know what i mean?
oh, it's lousy at first.
you think you're dying,
but then it's fabulous!
you become a new woman!
yeah.
reggie told me you'd gotten
terrific since you left him.
he said that?
well, you know what you
have to do for yourself?
you have to get out there
and circulate.
you can't sink into it.
you have to get out there
on the firing line.
oh, my god! no, no, no.
really. it's not bad.
look. if you did
your cheekbones better,
you could look like cher.
take this in the house.
can you handle it?
hello there.
i'm reggie dunlop of the chiefs.
i came to see your husband.
yes? i'm anita mccambridge.
how do you do?
think you can help with these?
yeah.
mom, i'm late.
i gotta go.
michael, you're gonna stay
in the yard,
put your jacket on,
and carry one of these in.
where's your husband?
he's in puppy heaven.
i own the chiefs.
this way.
what can i get you to drink?
canadian club and water.
nice place you've got here.
thanks.
to tell the truth,
mrs. mccambridge... anita.
yeah, anita.
you know, we all read about the
possibility of a sale...in florida.
and the guys are getting anxious
to find out what's going on.
i guess
i'm their representative.
we've been doing real good. my
accountant is certainly pleased.
oh. how is the sale going?
fine.
oh. good.
you think you're gonna like florida?
yeah.
oh, you are very clever.
what?
it's been so much fun waiting to
see what you're gonna do next.
the articles in the
paper are very funny.
that sportswriter?
dickie dunn?
dickie dunn.
you've certainly
got his number.
the radio interviews
are fantastic.
and the hanson brothers?
oh, my god!
well, attendance
has quadrupled.
yes. lam in the black for the
first time in four years.
that's great.
i guess i owe that to you.
thank you.
you're welcome. so you can
sell us real easy then, huh?
i could probably get some
interest, yes. oh, boy!
that's great!
that's just great, anita!
you know, for five months i've
been trying to prove to you,
without ever really knowing
who you were,
that you were wrong and we could get
somebody interested in the chiefs.
we could sew that thing
up tonight, you know.
we oughta cream those guys.
that's terrific.
but you have to understand that i
couldn't make enough of a profit
to have a sale
be worthwhile.
my accountant tells me i'm better off
folding the team, taking a tax loss.
you mean you could sell us,
but you won't?
i could probably sell you,
but i can't.
well...
you know...
we're human beings, you know.
i have to confess i've never let
the children watch a hockey game.
i have a theory that children imitate
what they see on a tv screen.
if they see violence,
they'll become violent.
if they see someone stick up a
bank, they'll stick up a bank.
heroin. you name it.
you're fucked!
what?
you are totally fucked!
you're garbage for letting
us go down the drain.
are you serious?
you could sell us. we're hot.
people go nuts for us.
you could find a buyer.
i don't think
you understand finance.
you know, your son
looks like a fag to me.
you better get married again,
'cause he's gonna wind up with
somebody's cock in his mouth
before you can say jack robinson.
how dare you!
how dare you!
our listeners
will be surprised to learn
that you're a very soft-spoken
young man, killer.
yes, i am.
i was watching kids
play hockey the other day.
five and six-year-olds, little mites.
one said, "i'm killer carlson."
he picked up his little stick
and creamed that other kid.
how do you feel about that?
the way i see it, the kid
probably would've done it anyway.
a bad upbringing
in the home or whatever.
that's interesting, dave.
could i be serious
for a minute?
<i>by all means.</i>
<i>i'd like to say that no matter
how the game turns out tonight,</i>
<i>i owe all that i am
to our coach, reg dun/op.</i>
<i>he's had the greatest
influence on me,</i>
<i>aside, of course,
from the swami baha,</i>
<i>whose positive thinking records
have been a tremendous help.</i>
positive thinking records?
yeah, that's right.
you can get them
at any religious record store.
i know that thousands of people
in charlestown have lost jobs
with the mill closing
and all.
i see 'em walking around the
streets depressed all the time.
i want to say to all you
unemployed folks,
you can get a whole new
lease on life
<i>with these records, nothing
will bother you anymore.</i>
<i>you can just go out and clobber the
next guy in your business life.</i>
<i>that's very inspirational, dave.
thanks.</i>
<i>take care of yourself.</i>
jesus christ,
what a fucking nightmare.
braden!
ned!
hey!
kid.
hey, come on back!
you don't have to fight.
you can do whatever you want.
it's up to you!
you know, i've had it with
this show business crap too.
i don't know what hit me.
i'm driving up and i say to
myself, "who cares about florida?
"screw the sale. it's probably
a bunch of crap anyway."
no, that's bullshit.
hey!
the team's history, kid.
there ain't no next year.
i'm tits up after this game,
no matter what happens.
but i'll tell you one thing.
we're gonna win that fucking
championship tonight.
but we're gonna win it
fair and square.
old-time hockey.
none of this wrestling shit.
you know, what the hell?
it's my last game.
i'm gonna go out with style.
play it straight.
i'd like to have you
there with me.
oh, you know, lily's been
staying at my place.
she's a terrific gal.
we've been having
a hell of a time.
hey, reg!
yeah, what do you want?
want me to circle,
run in with stretchers?
get out of here,
you goddamn parasite!
get 'em, baby!
get 'em!
this is jim carr.
jeff hanson,
i can't tell you what
you've done for all of us,
the pleasure you've given us.
i'd like to ask you one question.
win, lose or draw,
this is the chiefs' last game
before you leave charlestown...
we're gonna
kill 'em tonight.
what do you mean,
flood city?
never mind, jeff. i guess
that's before your time.
hey, reg dunlop.
how about a statement?
good game, fella.
good luck tonight.
get outta here.
reg dunlop has
asked us to come back...
come on, girls!
get out of here!
come on.
no hit.
the chiefs are history, guys.
there ain't no florida deal.
come on, reg.
what are you talking about?
i just made that shit up. we're
deader than this stinking town.
hey! dead history!
i conned you guys.
i just lied to you.
we were never anything but a
rich broads tax write-off.
it's never made a fuck's bit of
difference whether we won or lost.
nail 'em!
kill 'em!
we ain't been hockey players.
we've been clowns.
we've been goons!
we've been freaks
in a fucking sideshow.
we're a bunch of criminals.
we oughta be in jail.
that's all there is to it.
i'm ashamed.
not you, coach. yeah. i'm
really ashamed of myself.
see, ned was right.
violence
is killing this sport.
it's dragging it
through the mud.
if things keep up
the way they are,
hockey players will be nothing
but actors, punks.
i'm not playing
my last game that way.
last game?
yeah.
it's my last game,
and i wanna play it straight.
no more "nail 'em!" no more "fuck
with 'em!" that's finished.
i want to win that championship
tonight, but i wanna win it clean.
old-time hockey, like when
i got started. you know?
toe blake, dit clapper, eddie shore.
those guys were the greats.
i don't know what to say.
it's up to you.
reg is our coach.
sure, old-time hockey.
- like eddie shore.
- yeah!
coach, our line starts?
sure.
we got a game to win.
this is the big one, guys!
evening, boys.
wimpy, how are ya?
crash, how are you?
scotty.
better than philadelphia
this time.
you're gonna get an eyeball
of the new charlestown chiefs.
ladies and gentlemen, this has all
the earmarks of a hockey classic.
the championship confrontation between
the syracuse bulldogs and the...
here they come now! the
rags-to-riches cinderella contenders
of the federal league,
the charlestown chiefs!
let's go, chiefs!
let's go, chiefs!
let's go, chiefs!
let's go, chiefs!
let's go, chiefs!
let's go, chiefs!
<i>ladies and gentlemen,
i can't explain this delay.</i>
<i>i don't know why syracuse has
elected to miss the warm-up.</i>
<i>the chiefs have already skated
over to their bench.</i>
<i>it might be syracuse is afraid
to come out and face the chiefs.</i>
<i>oh, thanks, bill.</i>
<i>good heavens!</i>
<i>i've just been handed
the syracuse roster,</i>
<i>and it appears the syracuse
bulldog management</i>
<i>is real thirsty for a big grudge-match
type victory here tonight.</i>
they've brought back
for this one contest...
here they come now, led by
someone we all know very well,
<i>tim "dr. hook" mccracken!</i>
<i>and here's a name from the past.
ross "mad dog" madison.</i>
<i>ross, as you know,</i>
<i>never travels anywhere without his
longtime friend and attorney,</i>
<i>sam "small print" lyman.</i>
<i>and here's a name
for you nostalgia fans.</i>
<i>clarence "screaming buffalo"
swamptown!</i>
<i>i'll never forget an exclusive interview
i did with him many years ago</i>
<i>when buffalo revealed that he
liked to call his hockey stick</i>
<i>the big tomahawk.</i>
<i>he usually refers to the opposing
players as the little scalps.</i>
i thought he'd been
suspended forever.
<i>andre' "poodle" lussier,
defense.</i>
<i>andre' has been living</i>
<i>in semi-seclusion
in northern quebec</i>
<i>since the unfortunate
denny pratt tragedy.</i>
not poodle!
<i>and from mile forty,
saskatchewan,</i>
<i>where he now runs
a doughnut shop, number 15,</i>
<i>former penalty-minute record
holder of the federal league</i>
<i>for the years 1960 to 1968
inclusive, gilmore tuttle.</i>
<i>gilmore tuttle.</i>
<i>oh, gee. hold the phone.</i>
<i>this is
an unscheduled surprise.</i>
it's him!
<i>this young man has had
a very trying rookie season</i>
<i>what with the litigation, the notoriety,
his subsequent deportation to canada</i>
<i>and that country's refusal
to accept him,</i>
<i>that's more than most
<i>ogilthorp.
oggie ogilthorpe.</i>
hi, oggie.
buy you a soda
after the game!
hi. you know
toe blake? no?
we'll straighten you out,
you little prick.
how.
they don't call me dr. hook for nothing.
how ya doing?
all right, no high-sticking,
no tripping, no slashing...
major surgery. open heart.
i'm waiting for quiet.
yeah, you'll have quiet.
give 'em hell!
give 'em
the old-time hockey!
good crowd.
shirley!
teamwork! teamwork! teamwork!
eddie shore!
come on, get up!
one with the universe.
one with the universe.
nothing matters.
this reporter is stunned!
the charlestown chiefs
are not fighting back.
keep the guys off me!
come on!
the chiefs' performance tonight has
got to be a bitter disappointment
to these 4,000
charlestown fans
who have packed
this war memorial,
paying good money
to witness this fiasco.
get oggie!
move away, wanchuk.
you're screening me!
you're screening me!
move away!
give 'em some of that back!
don't let 'em
push you like that.
getup!
get off your ass!
i don't know
what's wrong!
you bums!
you're no damn good!
get up off your <i>ass!</i>
okay, you guys. let's get
some speed out there.
cement heads.
keep your eyes open.
better passing.
we got a big three
coming up out there.
try to come back
with the wingers maybe.
tonight's the night.
who wants an ice pack?
over here, charlie.
we need some more
coordination out there.
keep your eyes open.
better passing.
i'm coming!
it's all right.
mother of god. reggie: i want
a big rally this period.
- we're losing!
- more teamwork, guys.
they're burying us alive!
eddie shore?
piss on eddie shore.
old-time hockey?
piss on old-time hockey!
you're blowing it! boys!
every scout in the nhl
is out there tonight
with contracts
in their pockets,
and they're looking
for talent.
for winners!
all my years of publicity,
all the fashion shows
and radiothons for nothing!
they come here tonight
to scout the chiefs!
the toughest team
in the federal league!
not this
bunch of...pussies!
scouts?
this is more like it.
it makes me feel glad to see the
chiefs on the warpath again,
to coin a phrase.
god, it's been a long time since
this place saw my shadow.
what am i doing here? you look fabulous.
now, come on.
god, i'd forgotten.
<i>everybody is on their feet screaming,
"kill! kill!" this is hockey!</i>
kill! kill! kill!
let's go, chiefs!
all right! kill 'em!
<i>they're pummeling each other.</i>
<i>wait a minute. ned braden
is skating out on the ice.</i>
<i>he's not fighting. no. he's...</i>
<i>ned braden is starting to take
off articles of his uniform.</i>
way to go, ned.
<i>i don't want
any youngsters out there</i>
<i>to get the idea this is
the way to play hockey.</i>
stop that!
that's disgusting.
i protest!
protest? protest my...
<i>i'm certainly glad
mrs. carr isn't here tonight</i>
<i>because this is
a lascivious display...</i>
take it off!
make him stop
or we're leaving!
get your paws off me,
scarf ace!
stop him! this is a serious
game, not a freak show.
what are you talking about?
this is hockey!
you're afraid of these goons, aren't ya?
watch out, punk!
get that pervert off! get your
hands off me or forfeit this game!
forfeit, my ass!
look at that!
all right, that's it.
that's the game.

what the hell are you
talking about'?
come on, dummy. you won the game.
pick up your trophy.
here ya go, ya bum.
<i>the chiefs have won the
championship of the federal league!</i>
he's gonna
catch his death out there!
<i>i said some bad things about the
boy, but we can explain that</i>
<i>to the exuberance
and excitement of youth,</i>
<i>because he's certainly
changed his ways now.</i>
my boy!
hi, francine!
francine!
come on, honey. you got all
the room in the world.

hit anything. come on!
i got good news. i'm paying

somebody's playing
a joke on you.

the chiefs are history.
but the minute
i get up to minnesota,
i'm gonna bring
my guys up there.
we're a solid act, honey. we're
starting out with something big.
oh, jesus!
what?
you don't have my number.
if you want to get
in touch with me,
do it through the team,
the minnesota night hawks.
you're gonna need money
or something.
or maybe things won't work
out the way you expect.
geez, we've got a lot of
years between us, francine.
some hard miles, you know?
i know.
shut up,
you goddamn meathead!
honey, i gotta go.
