forgive me, consul han...
but i believe
we can ill afford...
to lose men
of your high character.
and speaking as a friend...
who's fought side by side
with you for 15 years...
i will sorely miss
the unshakable support...
you've given
the royal hong kong police.
so, on behalf of all brits...
who have ever carried the shield
in hong kong...
we shall miss you.
we wish you nothing
but happiness...
as you take up your new post
in the united states.
ladies and gentlemen,
consul han.
thank you, thomas.
you know thomas is not going
to make this evening easy.
excuse me.
commander griffin...
i am pleased to be able
to leave you and hong kong...
with a special gift tonight.
earlier this evening,
detective inspector lee...
and his special task force
have once and for all...
crushed the juntao
criminal organization...
and reclaimed artifacts...
from 5,000 years
of china's heritage.
thank you.
this is the kind of legacy
i dreamt about.
hong kong forever.
to hong kong forever.

yes, sir. your opening remarks
are scheduled for 7:30.
excuse me, consul han.
i'm warren russ with the
federal bureau of lnvestigation.
this is agent whitney.
we need to speak with you
in private.
excuse me.
i know this is a difficult time
for you, consul...
but be assured
we'll get your daughter back.
but will you get her back alive?
we have the best agents
in the world on those streets.
i would like
one of my people to help.
let me assure you, the fbi
considers this a top priority.
we have plenty of people
on the case.
mr. russ, i am not an american.
my daughter is not an american.
i understand that, sir- - 
he's already on the plane.
i trust you will treat him
with the same courtesy...
as you have shown me.
ten people
jumped out of the trunk.
i started handling all of them.
throwing them everywhere.
then two stupid cops
came out of nowhere...
messed everything up,
but then i regrouped.
i had to save their life.
it ain't in there.
anyway, i save their life.
i start runnin',
trying to get the bomb- - 
i can't believe
you went without me.
i'll talk to y'all later,
all right?
i'll tell you the best part
after work.
this is why nobody
wili work with you...
why you're the only cop in the
department without a partner.
johnson, look, first of all,
if you want a date with me...
you have to wait on the list
like every other woman, ok?
second of all, i work alone.
i don't need no partner
and ain't never gonna have one.
- did kojak have a partner?
- yeah. the fat guy.
he wasn't never with him.
did columbo?
captain diel ordered me
to go with you...
because you needed bomb squad
backup, but once again...
you screwed me and yourself.
look, johnson,
it's dangerous out there.
it's safer for you
to be behind the desk.
we were supposed to be
on the same team.
team?
johnson, this is the lapd...
the most hated cops
in the free world.
my own mama ashamed of me.
she tell everybody
i'm a drug dealer.
this is a pit stop for me.
i'm on the verge of leaving
you suckers behind.
actually, you're on the verge
of being suspended.
have a nice day.
somebody told you
i was being suspended?
quit playin', girl.
i know you playin'.
somebody told you
i was being suspended?
this is a problem.
that's all i need...
some foreigner
getting his head blown off...
and creating
an international incident.
what can we do?
he's on his way.
call the field office.
have them send over a rookie.
we'll have him escort this guy
around a few days...
pretend to follow some leads,
show him some sights...
keep him out of our way.
you want to do that
to one of men?
what do you suggest?
well, as long as we're
gonna humiliate someone...
might as well be lapd.
even if i had an extra man...
who would want
such a bullshit assignment?
well, it's a disgrace to me.
it's a disgrace
to my department.
it's a disgrace to- - 
dan, i'm sending someone
right over.
captain, i know you read
the paper, but they lying.
i wouldn't do nothing like that.
you know how the paper is.
they just want a story.
two officers were shot.
one man lost a pinkie.
but didn't nobody die.
- you destroyed half a block.
- that block was messed up.
- you lost lots of evidence.
- we got a little left.
what you did was dangerous
and completely against policy.
and not only that...
you did a good job.
what?
everyone around here
is so image- conscious.
everybody's so afraid
of their own goddamn shadow.
it's nice to meet
an l.a. detective...
who's willing to lay it
on the line.
captain,
that's the same way i feel.
that's what i've been trying
to tell everybody.
every so often, we have to let
the general public know...
that we can still blow shit up.
you goddamn right.
that's the only way i work.
so that mean
i ain't gettin' suspended?
- are you kidding?
- don't know why i said that.
i just got a call from the fbi.
the 10- year- old daughter
of a chinese diplomat...
was kidnapped this morning,
and they want you on the case.
fbi want me?
that's right.
- stop lying.
- i don't lie.
- tell the truth.
- i'm telling the truth.
thank you, captain.
congratulations, carter.
you are going to the show.
i'll look out for you
when i reach the top.
- i'm gonna make you mayor.
- i'd rather you didn't.
hey, listen up!
if anybody need me...
i'm gonna be workin'
a big, big case for the fbi!
yo. take care of that for me.
i need one of those earpieces
immediately, all right?
hey, how you doing?
i want the consul's personnel
records cross- checked...
with that new list
we received from lnterpol.
see if you can make
any matches or connections.
ok, boys, what have we got?
have we checked the consul
personnel records yet?
i want to know
who's he been talking with.
ok, come on. give me the story.
any demands? any fingerprints?
have we interviewed his staff?
whitney, who is this?
give me a copy of that.
james carter, fbi.
warren, he's here
for the special assignment.
i'm agent- ln- charge warren russ.
it's good to have you onboard.
i waited a long time for this.
you guys sure take a long time
to process an application.
well, carter,
your particular assignment...
is considered g- 14 classified.
why don't you and i take a walk
and i'll fill you in?
ok, warren.
g- 14 classified.
that's good.
you don't understand.
this is my dream.
i'm very excited
about working with the fbi.
i'm glad.
listen, his name is lee.
and the director considers
this a top priority.
no disrespect, but he's only
gonna get in my way.
i'm not used
to having a partner.
if i'm handling the situation,
i'm gonna have to work alone.
carter, he is the situation.
must be a misunderstanding.
i was sent down here for
the kidnapping. little girl?
forget the little girl.
your assignment is lee.
who and what kind of assignment
is that?
lee is a foreign detective
and a friend of the consul's.
it's your job to keep him out
of sight and away from danger.
yeah, you want me to baby- sit,
but i don't do that.
i came down here
for the big assignment.
the truth is,
this is an fbi operation...
and i don't need help from lapd
or some chun- king cop.
you got it?
whoa. hold it.
why not use your men
for this top- priority case?
what am i supposed to do,
take him to the zoo?
i don't give a damn.
i don't want to see him
or you till this is resolved.
now, his plane arrives
in an hour.
we want to make
a good impression, carter.
it's his first trip to america.
this is bullshit!
please tell me
you speak english.
i'm detective carter!

that are coming out of my mouth?
i cannot believe this shit!

captain, i don't think
this is funny.
no, i'm serious, captain.
i ain't playin'.

i can't do that, carter.
i'm sure that you and mr. lee
will have a nice time together.
you better call the fbi or
i drop his ass at panda express.
drop this case, you're suspended
for two months without pay.
well, you can forget
about being mayor then.
congratulations, carter.

we were making the drop.
han was about to get her back...
and you two screwed it up.

didn't you hear what lee said?
mr. lee is on his way
to hong kong.
now get out of here
before i file...
obstruction of justice charges
against you.
we was about to solve the case.
all we need to do- - 
you're no longer
on this assignment, carter.
case closed.
- consul han!
- sorry, sir.
it was all my fault.
lee would never do anything to
jeopardize your daughter's life.
he loves your daughter.
it's a little too late
for apologies.
consul...you have a call.
we're ready.
ok, pick it up.
the ransom is now 70 million.
i will call with instructions.
you deliver the money or pick up
the body of your daughter.
please. you must understand.
what happened tonight was not- - 
soo yung, please tell them
l wili do whatever- - 
sorry, man.
be sorry for soo yung.
no hard leads.
none.
listen, we're doing
all we can here, all right?
tracing everything that's coming
into this compound.
excuse me, consul.
you have a guest.
jack, let me get back to you.
thomas.
i'm sorry, my friend.
i couldn't stand by
and do nothing.
hey! what's up, baby?
man, you got guts calling me.
i'm gonna hang up.
hey, wait a minute.
don't hang up.
look, you know what?
you was right about me,
all right? i'm sorry.
- are you on drugs?
- you was right.
i was egotistic.
i was inconsiderate.
- i was self- centered.
- yeah.
i ain't used to working
with partners...
but it ain't about me.
it's the little girl.
she gonna die without our help.
you understand what i'm saying?
not yet, but keep talking.
i think something big going down
tonight, all right?
i need to know
where the consul's gonna be.
you think you can help me?
i'll see what i can do.
no. i don't need you to see.
i need you to do it.
can you do it?
ok, carter.
- all right, one other thing.
- yeah?
what color panties you got on?
consul han, i want you to go...
to the chinese expo
as you planned.
have the money
in the upstairs control room.
be sure to make no more mistake.
i understand, but i want
to speak with my daughter!
excuse me, miss.
who's the captain on this plane?
look, it don't even matter.
you need to go up there...
tell the captain we got
a problem on the left side.
something wrong with the engine.
you need a new alternator.
my supervisor said,
'willy, go on down there...
"and fix that plane.
put the alternator on.
"don't let it leave
till i come down there."
i suggest you tell
the proper authorities...
not to move this plane
before the faa comes here...
and we all in some shit. go on!
what are you doing here?
now get your ass up.
we got work to do.
go away. i've disgraced myself.
lee, what about the little girl?
leave me alone. a man like you
could never understand.
- a man like me?
- devoted only to yourself.
you're ashamed of being
a police officer.
you dishonor your father's name.
you don't know nothing
about my father.
you say your father is a legend.
my father was a legend.
he was killed making a routine
traffic stop in daylight...
by some punk
who didn't want no ticket...
when his partner supposed
to get out of the car...
and back him up, he didn't.
my father was as devoted as you,
and now he's dead.
and for what?
a traffic ticket and some punk?
you tell me,
what's the honor in that?
you believe your father
wasted his life...
died for nothing?
prove me wrong.
for 15 years until china
resumed control of hong kong...
juntao was the most powerful
crime lord in southeast asia.
the british tried to close down
his operation, but we failed.
but why the consul's daughter?
detective inspector lee
helped me raid...
every known asset
of juntao's operation.
we confiscated millions
in weapons and cash...
and a collection of chinese art
unsurpassed in the world.
then juntao disappeared.
no witnesses.
do you really think
he'll kill the girl?
my advice to you is...
pay the money.
consul, i'm going upstairs
to make the drop.
i want you to remain calm
as if nothing's wrong...
and don't leave agent whitney's
side even for a moment.
i understand.
good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
i'm am consul han.
on behalf of the people's
republic of china...
thank you for coming.
i am pleased to present...
and heritage...
a collection which,
until recently...
was thought to be lost forever.
this some nice shit.
that buddha'd go good
in my bathroom.
hey. this is the history
of my country....
priceless pieces
of chinese culture.
if anything gets damaged...
ain't nothing gonna happen
to none of this stuff.
and now we can pass them on
to our children.
pardon me.
i seen that guy
at that chinese restaurant.
consul han has been fighting flu
for the past few days...
so perhaps i should finish
what he started.
the first thing we gotta do
is clear out this riffraff.
if anybody stay behind,
they got something to lose.
wait right here.
i'll be right back.
...future between
our two countries.
the more we see
the differences...
hey!
and similarities- - 
excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen!
goddamn it.
i'm detective carter
from the lapd!
russ, we got carter down here.
what the hell's going on
down there?
we have just received
a threat on the building.
we ask that you please exit
the building...
as soon as possible,
and please do not panic.
didn't you hear what i said?
get your shit and go out!

there's a bomb in the building!
i don't believe this.

come on, come on!
titty, titty, titty.
get them titties outta here.
will somebody grab carter?
consul han, six blocks of c- 4
are wired to your daughter...
in a car outside.
before the changeover,
most of this exhibition...
was in the hands
of a single private collector...
me.
i worked most of my life
to acquire and catalog...
these priceless pieces
that you see before you.
and then, in one fell swoop...
it was taken away from me.
but tonight,
i shall be paid in full.
don't move!
she dies if i press this button.
just be patient.

this time.
i'm just gonna kick your ass!

from the lapd.
everything is ok now.
i'll take you to your daddy.

is take this vest off you.

i think it'll be safer
if we leave it on, ok?
don't- - don't move.
where are you?

it's ok. she's a professional.
you must take the vest off.
just give me a second.
there's a trigger on this vest.
it'll blow if i take it off.
haven't you done this before?
it's a little different
in the practice room.
everybody take cover.
we need more men down here.
say again. dan, do you read- -
