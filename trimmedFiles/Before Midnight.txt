you know as a child had
a cat named cleopatra

difficult i ever had to do
it was killing those kittens ...

ether plastic bags!

sometimes you win and sometimes
lost in this world

every summer, every christmas and i
i know .. it makes me uncomfortable
- it's so bad
as if we were sending
to boarding school or something
i do not know ... if your mom and i
we got along a little better
i know ... it is as if it
devolviéramos enemy lines
for real this time gave me strong ...
will be his first year in high school
that's the good news
this is crucial, i feel
i should be there for the
it's now or never
no. .. what you mean?
i thought that somehow
could live with us
time goes by so fast and
look, already in secondary
next thing you know will
to be running for college
if you're right, maybe it's time, of
i really think it's time to do all this

is that okay? she never give me something
which is not legally required
want to call that lawyer again?
- i hate that guy

- please do not anymore
the child does not know how
throwing a baseball
who cares ..
lead with your elbow, pulls like a girl
not your fault
- if so, a parent
supposed to teach you that
ok not like baseball
- it's not what you like
is a metaphor for all
turn 14 and have to be with his father
jessy i'm not moving to chicago
i asked you? where did that?
i'm just thinking out loud
that's all that i promised myself i would never do
and i'm doing
- you are a wonderful father
love their relationship, love
the letters i send
do not read the letters ...
- of course you read only
you do not have good lyrics
just know that if i get lost
these years will never return
oh my god
what?
this is where it ends
are you talking about
it's like people start to end
- oh my god
no, no ...
- you just jump off a cliff
no, no ... i'm serious, is the
day is like a bomb
they destroy our lives if
- ok first of all ...
you said he's a time bomb
- oh yeah whatever
you know what? this beginning
if? and that's how this happens
you are unhappy and blame the other person
and end that's all
you say that to scare you?
- no of course not
of course not!
- yeah, if that's what you do
no, actually i'm surprised
we've lasted so long
ok .. so ...
- we parallels a while but now
we are completely opposite
i go west and you east
and believe me this is how it
i've seen it happen ok?
you're kidding right?
- well not
i'm kidding ... and while no

yes!
your apple
truth?

- do not i have
it's in your wallet! and
give me your wallet too
ok i am the general
the overall ok?
and you do not touch anything
where is my team!
red!
ok pepper
actually i read the
two, the first is called
"at that time" and the second "at this time"
the first is "this time"
and the second is "that time"
if ...
- we have a joke in our family
that this was what brought us together again
and that payment for an apartment
- ok
but it must be rare for
a man reading a book
why? i think i got used
- the second is sexy
when you lose the plane
and have sex for days and days
as if there were no tomorrow .. i say
wow, really do those things?
they do that right?
- i hear there's a third book and
which is more bitter than the first two
considering that it took more time
writing the first two together
the third one i have not read, tell my wife
i bought it but it is too long
even the title is long
"temporary members a short but
good production of a play called escape "
well, exactly my point
- you're not alone, all
others thought the same
it is a better book, much more ambitious
what happened?
he said he likes all books
well ...
i say i love this place is
amazing those tomatoes are wonderful
i can smell them, they smell so good
if ... is very proud of them
i know it's stupid but ...
when we were
leaving paris was so
nervous coming here
and now we're about to go do not wanna go
because you were nervous?
- yes, because?
i do not know ... this place is so full
of thousands of years of myths and tragedies
i thought something tragic would happen
you thought someone
going to eat your children
if
exact
all the time i've been here i've been
working on an idea
about a group of people
with brain abnormalities
so the book would
as a day in your life
from every point of view only
as an old lady who has
the condition that makes you feel
like you're in a state of dejavu
i say every experience i have is
feel as if i had had before
i say may be sitting
here with us talking
looking quite functional right?
and in your head thinks ... not i said that?
i mean ... were not here yesterday taking
exactly this same conversation?
so like dejavu?
- yes, but all the time
that's what happens, all it takes
a loaf, a newspaper, a movie
she is convinced
already seen it before
it's true?
- yes, it is called persistent dejav ...
is real but i can not pronounce
ok ... and there are two other personal
with extreme facial recognition
there is a type and can not
recognize his wife for 20 years
he sees it in the mirror and not
feel connected to this man
and the other character is the opposite.
a housewife middle-aged
with a memory of all
faces he has seen in his life
and he lives in a huge city but
for it is a small
as a taxi passes and thinks ... "oh that's the
driver let me in
the mall for 3 christmases "
as an old lady walking down the street,
she recalls that
sat with her on the subway
so all those she
know feels intimate and connected
well i'm like the first type do not feel
connected to most of the time nothing
hey! eckolas! anna! hey guys
look at this guy is having
the best summer of your life
you said on ... this guy right?
no. .. are only three characters
is a group of people
we are working in chapter
now about a young man in macaless
i?
- well it has your name
and this guy is in the middle, all
what you see is a transition from all
as if seeing the sea thinks the
day will be dry and full of pollution
well do not know ... sounds pretentious
- no pretentions
it will be funny
he chooses a book and wondered who
will the last person to read this
and that's funny?
- sometimes i get something like
well then do not get excited
nothing, not with tits, swallow, nothing
just think about it
- well not so much
transformation is only
seeing very far ahead
ok ...
- i like this idea for a novel
but you should add a character
of an old man like me
you can not remember who took breakfast
but even listening to
song that was playing
when mine to campbell dance
topless when she was 14
that official
- ok have these people
lost in time right?
what is the connection? they will have
sex? they're going to know? something like that?
not the time in which they are
lost but in the perception
that's the deal, i put
entire novel on film
where each character gets to have
contacting the other at the front
you see that?
randall oh yeah, yeah
- ok the first chapter of the book
it is a weekend in times square in 1954
that lady with perpetual dejavu
appears on the screen except
all the time thinking
i have not seen this?
if ... and then in another chapter is
in 1979 film study classes
then we have a
retrospective in munich in 1993
it's time .. as
that's not the time?
it's time but is more perception
not like ...
- i think it will be too long!
well ... i like, do not
listen to him, he makes bikes
send it to me in wales
i will!
in france fill the tomatoes with
tomatoes and peppers with peppers
use the same, by
how you react
ok ...
be sure not to fill much
it is then inflated in the oven
ok ...
these well
especially do not listen to stefano here
because never made this dish
before or indeed any dish
stop fighting with knives!
stop stop fighting with knives!
we're not fighting we are negotiating
if ...
- negotiating ok this is how you call it?
it is a system which we have
- so they found something
that works for both
i thought it was called having a "relationship"
but i like the sound system
that's cute
we used to have that system
not so far guys!
ok do not want this food
pass without thanking all
y. .. especially you patrick did not have
idea what we were getting into these weeks
a letter arrived from college
inviting us to paleopaniese in greece
at the home of a great writer
sure! because there!
and then at the airport today
hank told me he has been
the best summer of your life
and i have to say the same
so thanks patrick
and not only so
did for me and my family
but for all that you bring to all
thank you, thank you, when i saw
for the first time at the airport
i thought ... there is no way that a man
well dressed man could be a lawyer
but now ... i think i learned a
secret, we've had many writers
the last few years but no
had more interest in it
i'm telling you
it was so great to have a
you and your wonderful daughters
and i'm so happy you could have
meet my dear friend natalia
that her husband was like my brother elias
sorry for the colonel
no. .. no ...
thanks for including
anna and me this summer
because you know that just pushes me to work
but ... when i bring anna
the supports me in doing other things
welcome to the biggest table
how long go together
- since last summer
we met a year here
in my last days with grandpa
before i had to go back
- yes, i met him at a party
i was doing shakespeare in the theater
what role did?
it was fantastic, remember
patrick went to see her?
when you dance wish
do not do anything more than that
the way you just said
that was better than the type of the work
people still keep talking about it
but the after party was
best is where we met
if ... we were all there
- very cute
so ... were tossing and turning all
night and then had to return it to the theater
to collect your things
and it was the best
- and i'll never forget
we were out and had 12 000 people
and at that time was completely empty
and she was in the back row
so ... i went on stage
and whispered something
- it was amazing
i could see his mouth moving
and then 3 seconds later
i could hear his voice in my ear
he say?
it is private
and then had to return
to paris a few days later
as you kept in touch?
- we talk on skype
every day from here
and we had something, we put
the laptop on the pillow
y. .. slept together
oh that's the new romance
and when i woke up the screen
was usually frozen
and anna's face was
an awkward position so ...
i can ask you a question?
when talking on skype
you know ... become something crazy?
my god! these being so vulgar!
- i'm just a amateur anthropologist
they are interested in the virtual world
now you're an anthropologist
- yes, the sex of the near future
and you will have virtual sex with anyone
you can program all your preferences
you do exactly what you want
maybe even i like that! yes!
i mean .. because there!
one of the best experiences are
to take place in the virtual world
if ...
and you're a writer like
you will feel when you do not
you can write a better
book as above
that will never happen
- i think what you want
that is when it happens
i think probably i
feel better in the same way
in such players such as when
chess felt when they could not
first compete with that huge
computer ...
we thought never a machine
would beat the best
the human machine likes
you know and now we can not compete
i saw a doctor when they made
an experiment in a laboratory
y. .. was wired and pressed
i did have an orgasm
scientists were mocking
of this pathetic creature
while ignoring their food
and water and did nothing more
and eventually died
i think that's the future of mankind
and die!
well maybe
every generation but believed
is seeing the end of the world
but ...
i feel like i'm living it
- ok i have a question for you patrick
i think many people are
feels so ... you know
we are like obsessed with pleasure
adult porn
materialistic seeing our
humanity with technology
at the same time the
computers get old
truth? so my question is
that there is nothing to start
well is written in
the portals of a temple
says ...
which means "anyone but yourself"
yes but we are 99% automatic
not our personality or this thing
we think of as ourselves
it is only a fraction of
what the brain
most have the body
fully functional
so that's what
really seeing?
this notion of self
is a small percentage
as is always
i hear so much about it?
well it's like my penis is not as
large, it is a small part of myself
but you have to avoid
do not call attention
he's jewish!
and as you two meet?
- you do not know?
what?
you have to read his books
- if you especially if you want to know
exactly what it is to have sex with me
sorry!
i'm sorry but i read them
if ...
we met 18 years ago
and as we fell a little
y. .. then lost track of each other
and a decade later, we are
no, no ... we crossed
you wrote a book
inspired by a meeting ...
yes, yes ...
- and i read it and went looking
that romantic
- not so much
he was married again
- details!
if ... that was a disaster
- it was not a disaster was unavoidable
ok and the first time that
had sex without a condom
twin! and change it from there
sorry to say that
- the girls are so beautiful
they are cute
ok ... no, no, they have their ups and downs
ok .. let me tell anna
and keep a man
you have to let them win in
all these little games
oh god!
- when i met jessy
the first night we played
and of course i won
- the foundation of our
relationship is a lie?
and then at the last minute
let the ball hit the middle
and gives them confidence if they
stop winning in all games
we would never have sex
i mean ... say sorry
but it is an almost underground
he dreams of having a whore as a wife
it is my greatest aspiration
well ...
if?
so you're a writer?
if ... insurance
so you write like ... books?
i've written a couple if safe
i've never met a writer before
you must be very smart
you know ... i can even write
my own name when i'm tired
what kind of books do you like?
well i like stories
with a meaning behind them
as a love story
oh sure if
you know ... i read a book once ... romeo and ...
- juliet
yes!
i know
- if it's too good a work of truth
it is not a work book ...
- oh i thought it was a
book based on a movie
no, not a work
- ok it was a work
the truth did not read everything because sometimes
i have to be aware and read magazines
to find out exactly what happens
in the lives of all those people
well it is important
- ok you are very clever
and i bet you have a giant penis
because i feel so attracted to this woman?!
and that's the funny part
the not so funny is just
two days after we left henry
he told me that although i have a
amazing offer for a job
wants us to move to chicago
it's not what i said, i said i missed
hey you stop talking, should not have
been so hard to say goodbye right?
if clear
- and i say a child is so amazing
if ... i did my sidekick
when stefano and i separate
i will ask for full custody
it's okay for a while
because my girlfriend of 20 years and i
we are a little worried
i i love you
- and i love you you
ok ... i have a story that my husband loves
and tell you all you have
to know about male and female
ok ready?
my mom used to be a nurse and was
there when people came out of the coma
listen, it's an interesting story
i'm listening
- so she was telling them ...
hi .. my name is caterina
these out of a coma
you were in a very bad
car accident
you'll be fine
you'll be fine and so
he said the first thing that every human
do or the first reaction with
would be to ask how are my children
as is my husband?
someone else was injured
every man without exception
first thing they did ...
look at your penis
you know what? you have to make
to continue there and keep it running
you have to!
- and it has to be alive
if and only eventually
ask their children
or on someone else who can
they killed accidentally
important things well
- first penis and then the rest of the world
penis! penis!
but if you can explain everything with terms
for all time women lose
bothering to try
change a man?
exactly! what is the problem?
and they are so good giving
back to things
no ... only ... is like that
upset because a frog is green
yes! exactly!
- listening to all this
i wonder if this idea of
love that lasts forever
i say we still relevant
we'll end eventually
your parents are still together?
- no of course not
no and that about yours
- we are but could divorce
i think if they had more
money would not be together even
god is so practical,
born in his generation
the mother of my grandmother
i call the whole family of 26 people and they
gave everyone something from his deathbed
he wrote three pages on a
person he met in a work
and only one paragraph with her husband
- was an actress too?
no. .. was ...
seamstress
and i had some friends
wonderful and my grandfather
she mentioned three things
you went to war, we
moved by this work
and died
his great council was not
be consumed with love
in all her husband gave happiness
i could not agree more
that's what really helps us
that idea of ??the soul mate
or someone who could come
a complete us and save us to take care
with stefano, well, low
bar completely
i know it will not win any money
definitely not
- what about grandma? it was your soul mate?
sounds nice, but the truth
your grandmother was more rational
she cared and asked me to do the same
we had plenty of room
to meet in the middle
if that sounds ideal
what is it?
but it should be obvious that
my wife is not here today
were 2 and we preferred
that is so beautiful
i think my husband
always tries colonizarme
i'll colonized?
yes but i do the same
but at the end of the day
it is the love of one person
that matters but the love of life
that's good to know because
i can handle life's
on the other hand ariadna
hey guys if we can not reach that
hotel tonight may have a refund
no. .. not give us a refund
- they're trying to get out of it?
because they will go
- it is a great gift
but i'm so stressed
trying to pack everything
no, no ...
- we made a deal guys
leave the kids, they will love
it's a fantastic walk to the hotel
and i would be offended if they do not go
ok ...
thanks
iran ...
- well ... when i think of my husband
what i miss most from him, is the
way it was put to me at night
sometimes his arm
stretched across my chest
and i could not move to
sometimes i could not breathe
but i felt safe
complete
y. .. strange how
whistling as he walked down the street
and every time we do something
i think people would say
when it's cold today wearing a scarf
but lately i
forgetting small things
everything is starting to fade
and i'm starting to forget
and it's like that ...
as well lose it again
sometimes i remember
every detail of his face
her eyes her lips her teeth
his hair his skin
but now it is no longer
and sometimes ... sometimes but not always
i can see it
as if a cloud moved and the
is there like you could almost touch it
but then ... enters the real world
and he vanishes again
but i do this every morning when
the sun is not so bright outside
but the sun is as
makes it disappears
and comes and goes as the
sun when it rises and when it gets
whatever ...
it's like life
we appear and disappear
and we are so important to some
but we are just ... passing
passing
we're just going
and eventually sees her face
the reflection of the window
and he realizes that it is not a
and his eyes are with tears
- this sounds sad
at first i thought you were going to tell a
history of the kind that
has an imaginary friend
what?
- when in his years
if that!
- you like that?
remember that letter you left me read
you wrote when you were like 20 years
yourself for 40 years
- yes, i remember the first sentence
dear jessy 40 years
hope you're not divorced
not even remember that part i meant
to all the other things in the letter
you always say the same type
believe that we are evolving
but we can not change much to say
you know i think i've changed a lot
- how so?
when i was younger
wanted time to speed
why?
good to be alone,
to be free from my parents
for school and stuff, i just wanted to close
eyes and wake up as an adult
and now i feel that this step and
i want everything to slow
it's rare i always had the feeling
that no matter where in my life
it is a memory or a dream
- always talk about it
i also like
was happening right now
it's happening
- i know!
every year it seems that i get
more humble and more overwhelmed
these are all things that
ever know or understand
that's what you say you know nothing
- i know, i know! but i'm getting better
but not knowing things is not so bad
i mean ...
the point is to look
keeping the mood
i do not know ... i only wish
make it easier
what do you mean?
- just to maintain a certain level of passion
we used to be so natural
remember when i was younger,
my writer friends and i
we used ... just felt like it
were doing something important
you know? that was our time
- but they were all a lot
arrogant idiots right?
no! okay maybe ... do not know .. single
than where would we get all that energy
all that creativity and
ambition that all people had
you need to be a little crazy
to keep you motivated
young people do that all
time comparing each
are signals for
which are judged each
you used to do that all the time
- what else?
you were talking about more than when you were 17 years
yes but women do not think so
- do not you think?
no. .. that we have much to compare
most women
would do anything in life
the first time
hear of them have 50
years because it is so difficult
have recognition
they fight for 30 years at home raising children
before you can do what you want to do
actually you know what? it's free
we need not spend our lives
comparing us to martin luther king
ghandi ... tolstoy
- what about joan of arc?
i mean ... she was a
teen and except to france
who wants to be her, forget to france
she was burned at the
stake and still a virgin!
ok? nothing i aspire to that great achievement
oh god ... -
what? -do nothing
what?
- this is so weird
what do you mean?
- this, we walk and talk
about something other than food, work
i mean when was the last time
things were out there talking
hear what i hear?
the sea?
- no
what? oh! no small feet
nothing ... things being thrown to the ground
nothing we have
clean any injustice
if ... when was the last time?
when we did not have in
nowhere to be?
if ...
i used to kick your ass in ping
pong in those concrete tables
congrats! you beat a
pregnant woman with twins
it is better to lose a
pregnant woman with twins
if ... o god!
you know i think? i think it's time
we left the house of our fathers
until we have children is the only
once your life is entirely yours
i think i've had as a decade that
one day, a week, a
year there is no big difference
if ... i know, i used to spend
work time watching
and boyfriends and stuff i can now tell you
every detail of the last seven years based
on what happens in the lives of girls
if ... clear
you do the same?
- yes, if
i say the time is now marked
- no, i just feel
surprised you do that too
ok ... rapid test
august 2009
no, come on! it was going fast?
august 2009 were
holiday with your parents
a nía had chickenpox and
quickly spread to ela
i am so impressed
- if you give me a gold star?
perhaps
hey ... i can ask you a question?
- insurance
if we met for the first time
on a train find me attractive?
clear
- no, but now as i am
i really talk to? i would ask
i get off the train with you?
i say this by asking a question
theoretical, what my situation?
technically it would not be cheating?
ok because you can not say that if?
- i wanted to say something
malograste romantic and ok?
ok, ok ... expected if i saw you on a train
ok listen i would be looking at you and say ...
these putting so hot
like an egg in a pot
stop! that's disgusting!
no! the truth is that you failed the test and the
fact is that i
you invite to go on a train
i do not even notaries,
one middle-aged mom
losing hair
- ok ...
yes, that's me
- i put a trap to fail
ok true
but in the real world bald
if you talk on a train i did
and it was the best i could do
really? look at the goats
you know not even
a real question
if you are invited you to get off the train
if ...
- i bajarías me?
of course not, i have people waiting
a man of 41 years
one hormone 15
how horrible! i'm scared now helps!
i can not believe i have 41 years
- yeah, me neither're so old
never thought i would sleep with
someone who has more than 40 years
if ...
- you know what? you are the most
old with whom i slept
that is something
- true
i know i'm the older guy
when you've done oral sex
what!
- the conference in warsaw
that conference?
lech walesa! are you talking about?
- it was before we're together
you can not admit it? i can
remember how you talked
as he opened your heart,
definitely did oral sex
ok ... 're crazy!
that was gorber shoved
ok? american obsessed with football
sorry i got confused
and i did not do oral sex ok? take it back
ok, ok
god!
then went to another?
well guess what?
listen to this .. i was going to wait to tell you this
to later but already enough secrets
what? you have a tumor in
the brain going to die?
no no
nothing like
well the truth is something
my grandmother died
- what! when?
yes, my dad sent me an
text before we eat
oh i'm sorry because
could not you tell me?!
everyone has been waiting for, lived
a long time had a great life
he was 96
- not much later lived
that your grandfather died
no. .. just a year ... the funny
is that this woman was a saint ok?
she was a nurse in the war
we take care of all of us
you know ... never said anything bad about anyone
i wish you have imported
- it's ok
okay, because in the end no
i wanted to meet new people
i say after a lifetime of being the
sweeter once you grandfather died
as you ... i do not know, put something bitter
really? what happens is that he was in mourning
yeah well my dad says
was waiting to die
how long were you married?
shit! how is that possible
how old would be if
we were to be together 74 years
well since when we would start to count?
i guess that since the
first time we had sex
ok ...
if great so ... 1994
ok ... 1994 ...
- we would have 98
you could put up with me for another 56 years more?
i have to know because
i do not know if i can you
it's crazy if you think
all changes you saw
when they met
none had electricity
he used to take her to school on her horse
when he was graduated victorian
what's that?
- it was the first class and her second
i bet it toward some things
evil that he does not feel threatened
no, if you wanted to have sex and had to be
yes, obviously you know who
- anyway, i called my
pope just to say
i was sorry and that but i think
the jodi somewhere said ...
hey pope're an orphan now,
i do not think it was funny
not funny at all
- yeah, i guess not
the following is then your
well ... told me that my grandparents
wanted to have something both together
they wanted to have his ashes
mix and be buried as one
your grandfather did not have a funeral?
- they said they did not want that
oh yeah ... i kind of like the
idea that you come to my funeral
what?
- no, i know ... i imagine your in a suit
clean-shaven holding hands
with the girls, do not know, i like
you are safe to do so
- we'll see
i guess one of the two vera
think i want to go to service me?
a texas?
- not in paris
ok how much you want to go?
i want to go but it is very expensive
with flights ..
- it would be simpler to just go
oh hello!
well you know if i'm not there would
easier lame you your cousins
if ... that's true
- that's not common where you come from?
you did not answer the question
- what question?
well ... could put up
other 56 years more?
i look forward
- shit, i really do it right
the nectar of your years
is like a thin line
my spanish lover hairy back
watch this
this place reminds me of a movie
i saw as a teenager
it is a black and white film of the year
remember a couple walking through pompeii
viewing bodies that had
been lying there for centuries
i remember the bodies
even holding and loving
do not know why, sometimes i have
this picture in my mind
where, you know, i'm asleep and i embrace
well ... be buried under
earth? that's what you think?
yes!
that's not funny!
i do not know .. it is horrible
corpses had children say
that's cute
yeah, i guess i was young and somewhat morbid,
i mean at that age think
to die with someone you love
now you die with me?
- perhaps you know if you ... you know
our first night together
a while but now ... no!
want to go!
because you can not say something romantic?!
oh no!
ok if you want you can ask me again
but no sooner
sorry
ok ... chapel is telling you
has about 1000 years old
you can get in?
- yes, i think
watch this
people come from everywhere and
leave their dedications to the blind
to help restore sight
and these pictures here make me
think about japanese monks
i like to paint with water and rock
for when you finish and will have evaporated
as slanted eyes
that's about blindness?
no. .. not that
but a guy told me that the turks
did that during the occupation
that's it? never eat
turkish food again
oh ok
that will be good for the
international community
ok ... okay then
never suck another cock turkish
ok that will have a global impact
oh that's terrible, forget it's bad
make oral sex jokes in a church
the girls asked me to
again as was our wedding
if? what did you say?
i said i was ... fairly simple
but at least you can still remember
very fast
i do not know because they want to get married
it is important for them
we want to get married in a church?
- no
it's all those tales
fairy that they like both
remember when you were small and
after each drawing they saw
there was a "marry"
even if it was pinocchio and his
potato or duck and his nephews don
so if we are to
spend another 56 years together
if ...
- who else would like to change about me?
what?
- it's another one of your questions
in which i can not win
i will not answer that
- what do you mean?!
there is one thing that
like to change about myself?
i'm perfect?
- ok the truth
if you could change one thing about you is
you let me try to change me
you are a very manipulative man know that?
i know how you operate
- you think?
yeah, everything about you, come on over here
do not think you know the truth
- no?
well ... i know you better
than anyone on the planet
maybe that's not saying much
this is great, i feel close
to you, but sometimes not ...
i feel as if ... were
breathing helium and oxygen
what makes you say that?
see? i try to connect to
truth and make a joke!
no!
- is exactly spoken
let if we know each other
i think we could say
know each other better first
if ...
remember to friend
mine, george of new york?
no ...
oh no, that was before ... no, no, as
he was a friend of mine that when
learned that he had leukemia
and he was dying he confessed that
the first thing that came to mind
is relief
- relief?
if ... well ... before
unknowingly had nine months to live
and always had to worry about money
and now thought ... great!
i have more than enough money
to live the next 9 months
ok
and then he enjoyed everything about the
life even be stuck in traffic
enjoy watching people and seeing their faces
only things
and then what happened?
- what do you mean?
well ... still alive?
no. .. died long ago
last night ... i had a dream where he read a book
but it was a lost classic "the rovers"
if you like ... loitering, was about young people
ok ... is a real book?
- no, but it was great
it was cool, funny,
experimental, had lots of energy
i love that the books in your dreams
and always good!
- i have dreams of hero
as i was flying as
a super hero through walls
and in the end i have an orgasm
i hope your dreams
come true affection
still there
still there
he was

- oh i think the room is already paid
if ...
- if so but the card is for
for accidents

these issues in greece
it's very nice, what is your name?

madeleine, not the truth,
people assume that i am
but not me, he has
a huge imagination

i'd be happy to do
- ok

- hey look at this!
stefano and ariadne us
bought a bottle of wine
and a couple massage
they are so good, we have to
buy something before we go
no, no, we should remember
something for the kids too
if ... i know anyway
i miss girls
- i do not
it's a nice view ...
the only view in which i am interested
what?
this right here
if ...
what?
it's funny never noticed until now
but all the red of your beard is no longer
it used to be one of the
things that i like you
not going to tell me that your love
pigment depends on it?
no?
no, but you know ...
i see that red in our girls
the look and makes me think
to when we met
you're what i'm looking for
if after ...
this weekend
without the twins jumping around?
exact
thinking?
i like waking up with that sound
with your eyes open and close
when you said you could
listen i thought you really think
but they were only my eyelashes
that silly and romantic
that's my favorite
strange to think well and
i hate to think in the morning
i'm anxious now
ok ...
stop talking for picking
henry is ok
- hey baby are you okay?
these in london?
oh ...
ya? ok
oh no, we do not find
i'll send by mail
do not worry about tomorrow
if ...
oh, miss you too,
i'll kiss your hand
if ...
ok ... i will tell
good luck with your mom, if
i love you too, bye
ok ...
ok
he says he will call you
chicago when landing
because i can not talk to
it? i did that twice
come on, you could not spend your phone?
you know you want to talk to the
well i had no time to talk
what did you say?
- the science project
send it tomorrow
he'll be fine
- you should not say that about your mom
what? i said?
- good luck with your mom
no. .. i meant no harm
i know but not good, reminds
everything wrong and would not do that
oh ... as if you believe that you forget?
i mean ... acts like it never happened
do not put it in your head that goes
if you want to think about it now
it means nothing?
ok even made a joke the other day
let your mom and i should
attempt a wrestling show
you said that?
- the river has better
your sense of humor
come on!
i do not know ... i say we just talked about
so you can not say things in his breast
well i said nothing about
his mom made a joke
what it is
only not to contradict all that
i think this big
you know how bad it is
all between her mother and i
your mom and i ...
- i did nothing it all comes from my
ok she hates me, if i caught
her husband a long time ago
or should i say he took me to my
if clear
ok do that
his mother and i do not love
there is the problem is not going to traumatize
that already happened
ok? and now try to eat
your fault and say that i am?
no. ..
unlike if you could know
make a joke about it
maybe you could live better
with it that's what i think
ok ...
you're right, as always
just do not talk about it ok?
it's not anyone's fault that his mother is
one drunk and psychologically abuse
do not say that!
i mean i have to be sick
with her but judges take
that women have a maternal instinct
she has the maternal instinct madea
madea not?
if ... after all it's a greek myth
the truth is on euripides
- a woman who kills her children
to punish her ex-husband
that is physically making
this hurting him to get to you
no, it's making my life
hell through the
that's what she's doing
but sometimes things go too far
ok stop blaming me for everything that
wrong and all this with your wife if?
ex wife! for a long time
- ok you should put things right for
time but do not hate us so much
ok ... ok ... the jodi
not everything is perfect in our life
now put this shit
on me about henry
are you talking about
let me talk about moving to
chicago and give up my life
now you mentioned
henry needs you
how do you think that makes me
feel? i'm miserable right?
as i can take that
work now? tell me, tell me
i feel too guilty
- it's the choice you take seeing him like
is that okay?
it is the nature of
be women that helps
what?
a nurse
ok i can not even say,
i just feel bad about it
and you look at me like it was my fault
- i look?
as i forget to put in
his suitcase science project
i know you blame me
- i said nothing
no. .. had not said nothing to do
yes, always my fault
- yeah right
i saw in the fridge at work, your
know with those letters magnetized
with prayers that make
someone had put "women
explored in all eternity "
in the garden of sacrifice
that is a sign of god
if ... this line is so true ...
and it has been for 10,000 years
but that was not enough
i want to be one of those women
as marriage is
important for gays
or the rights of women is
the same to let my hopes
with millions of women
i had to do it and not do it
this is bigger than me
this means more than i
bravo nobel committee is taking note
wait'll alert sweden
i mean ... must be a work of
full-time load as much pressure
what is
- you suffered both growing
in a middle class
the agony of the post-feminist
i can not imagine
- you're an idiot
you know what honey? when
we're moving to chicago?
i want to make sure i could find
a nice house and can do everything
y choose bed covers
so this is how you spend the night?
this is what i want to do tonight?
- you started
you're the one who never shuts up about
this, but if you want to talk about it
i mean seriously talk rather have
emotionless rational conversation
think we can say
do that? would it be possible?
here we go
- without being emotional and rational
always do the
the one that is rational
and i'm the irrational, hysterical
because i have emotions speak
from your big prospect
this means that all
what you say is true
always i'll do anything
- the world is fucked
for irrational crap
deciding sucks
is that okay?
- politicians offer a reason
the corporate heads decide
destroy the environment
channey, roosevelt, very rational men
if ok
- if you know a solution
very rational
ok so we against the final solution
ok ... let's do it right? let me ask you this
think henry's life would
better for a more consistent
from his father
here we go
- i do not want to leave there
so if you talk about it?
just let me ask you a question
think in the next
life would be better with
a consistent presence of you and me?
yes! i think it would be better
if he lived with us
and i think her mom is a
damn alcoholic motherfucker
i use the time we were
in paris and i was giving birth
and almost dying to get
henry legally new york
to hell with it
- ok i agree with you
ok, unfortunately
we can get him out of america
but we could if we wanted to go where the
now i know that would be a big move
but you think? there are so
you can be happy in america?
or just out of range of possibility?
i mean you could find
comparable work there?
comparable? are you kidding?
- no!
because i'm the one with
to make compromises?
i mean ...
- it's so dramatic ok?
good move to chicago is dramatic
i'm not saying we should move
i just want to talk about it
you can be my friend for 2
seconds so we can talk?
ok 2 seconds
- okay
remember that day you arrived 35 minutes
late to pick up the girls from school
and you were so stressed knowing
who were there at the games
wondering what happened to you? ok well
is how i feel all the time
you know, jodi, it leaves behind
and want to be more with the
you're always like that when you leave
these sad and you start to fight
he's good, is a great guy ok?
but the truth is that you do not
needs as it used to need you
you missed the opportunity
to be with him in his childhood
and you mourn over
but it is growing
you're a great father other
ok these divorced ways other
ideal? no, listen if a
month even want to leave my job
and leave everything you've been
working all these years
just ask me but now i
i feel like i have always felt
i would move back to the united states if
that wife of yours gives custody
to see jessy
less than 30 days per semester
and if you think it is worth to
we change our lives
only by that time
- i know you're right
see? i'm being rational
it's just ... a bad
position he did nothing
but he is the one who has to pay all
now we have him in our lives ms
if it were not for my your marriage
was over something else
absolutely
- or worse have been raised
two miserable parents
sure ...
it is a joke
you mean you fucked to
move to paris to be with me?
no ... not what i meant
stop! you know that's not what i meant
i told you not to do ok?
- stop it!
ok ... i moved to new york
you for two years and leave everything
but i needed to be home
to give birth to the twins
because it was something complicated and wanted to be
with my mother and also wanted that
if
- that's all i ask
the only thing ... and now i
blame you forever?
stop please
stop
if you do not want to move to usa
we will not end of story
is that okay? just trying to find a
way where i can be more consistent
in this life and ideally
i would like to do as a family
as a family or what?
what the fuck does that mean?
i feel a threat passive-aggressive
in everything you say,
i do this or i resentiré
the rest of our lives
i have reason?
you know what? i'm feeling
something ... i think the problem
i just do not want
who has a better job
on some level you feel
i threatened to accomplish something
that would minimize your
been in this relationship
my state? in our relationship?
i teach two courses per semester
in an american school damn ok?
that ... this is a great status
i do not think it's a coincidence that
feel that we are at the same time
and that i have a chance
exciting work
all this is complete shit and you know it
i have a question for you
- if we had the girls
still be together?
what?
you're the mayor of villa-madness
you know? what are
- i think you have to move to chicago
i think henry needs you
and i have to stay
in paris with the girls and take the job
why are you doing this? that's a ridiculous idea,
i will miss you and the girls? not
because you make everything so difficult?
- you're unhappy with me
you blame me for your son away from
that is irrational
something i try to do
listen jessy
we just spent the last
you could write all
days and the weather has been good
but i wanted to come to greece
- what is
it could be a revolution
at any time
people can do something
and act all happy but not
talk about how annoying they are
and i'm confused and do not know what will happen
let me tell you what will happen,
the same thing always happens
nothing
okay, you know what? i have had
zero time for myself
i have 10 000 e-mails
i have not answered answer
think i do not?
- spend all day making dinner
and while you and your
friends urinate outside the toilet
you are a genius! oh blah
blah no! you are a genius!
and the second we said goodbye to henry
suggest that perhaps
should quit my job

walk under the trees oil
oh socrates should get a rope

- for when you leave and when you return
two hours, he could do
that, you are very good taking care
i take care of myself and everything else
if we go somewhere you pack up
your suitcase and i do everything else

- i am happy that you
contemplate the universe
and all existential problems
because i do not, i have hardly time to think
labor'm babysitting job, i'm babysitting
wait a second, i have to do something
you know what? the only time i can think
is when i'm in the bathroom at the office
begin to associate the
thought with the smell of shit
that's a good thing
you should put that in a book someday
yes, i'm sure you will
and will be the best line of the book
and of course you can never
use me or what i say
in one of your damn books
again and that goes for girls too
ok
you should not mess with a writer
you were not in the last book or
in which i am writing now
and finally, write about what you want
as always, we serve
do not give me that shit
we're not in the 50s sorry
for ruining your perfect narrative
with the truth but i'm the one in
home every day dealing with the shit
why are you at work
to the 6:30 to 6:00
take the girls to school and i
pick them up and that's just our deal
we live in paris france
if and i remember every day
i have made my life around you and you know
ok? so sorry if
these are not holidays
for all that i see
do is eat greek salad
ok? but you should not spend your
life in some kind of torture
you know what? what i love about the
is men who still believe in magic
the little fairy collect stockings
the fairies who take the
dishwasher dishes
hadas blocker that put children
little fairies making salad
greek eat like a pig
ok listen if? you're great taking care
what are
i mean ... look after the children you care
your friends, take care to the world
were you this before you were
breast and now is only magnified
but ... i've been saying this
for years have to do a better
job taking care of yourself
ok stop
i am the one at home
every day at 6:30
i am reliable, have you ever
made an appointment with the nanny before?
no, what is the name of your doctor?
stop asking me questions is boring
if .. ok ... know what? i'm home
every night, i made dinner, give baths
and i read bedtime stories sometimes these
there or sometimes in a college event
or a publicity tour
ok? when you are inspired
keep writing
i sometimes am inspired
want to write? ok do
no, but remember we used to sing
and play guitar and play songs
even i'd do it but i have no time
ok ... well first of all
i do not write as a hobby
second, i wish
find the time ... of
somehow find
time to complain
and i say ... i love the way you sing ok?
jodi my life by the way you sing
ok? if you took an eighth of the
energy you spend complaining, crying
and worrying, if you put
that energy into something good
i mean serious django
ok
forgot your shoes
you think you're winning?
very few people know what it is for
active and passionate woman to have a child
some friends tell me that
would jump out the window
ok? but the truth is that you never
i wanted to hurt them even once
but i thought about killing myself over 100 times
i was so confused that always
were in a stupid book tour
holy shit custody
henry and do not want to burden
do not play with words!
it's the same, you know how many times i
been alone with the girls crying?
not knowing what to do? you know the guilt that
a mother feels when you do not know what to do?
think you're still owns that feeling?
do not think you understand ok?
you know what? my fear
secret with men is
we all want me
submissive housewife
ok ... no one could ever do that
i promise it would be easier
fit your head to a toaster
they become submissive
when the girls were born did not know that
do people expect women
let us have an instinct that appears
but i had no idea how to do things
i love them so much and was doing it all wrong
and you were away so often and always
asked me how was my day
i could not even tell you because
i was so ashamed of not knowing what to do
look i think you did well
- no of course not
sure, well, at least you did
one great job faking it right
i remember that the only way
to make you sleep
it was that stupid car pulling the
stairs and walk with them for hours
in the middle of the night
almost once stole the only
why not the guy attacked me
it was because i was so pathetic the only
good to have more than 35 is that you do not violate
i read it, it's true
- oh jesus
one time i remember that
i was watching the twins
and they looked so cute and was
happy because they were happy
and one of them had ... one hulla-hulla
i was using as jump rope
but then the other wanted it so
they began to fight for it
and out of nowhere saw it all
all jealousy and selfishness
and i remember thinking ... this
is the natural state of man
always a little dissatisfied and discontent
i mean ...
look at us
here we are, we are
in ... the garden of eden
and we can not stop fighting
i do not think there is a human state
natural human state is multiple
i mean, if that's what you see
when you see your daughter playing
it means that these depressed
ok ...
perhaps this
- when i see them i see beautiful energy fight
moving forward in life while
that no one would take what they have
i like when they fight gives me hope
well it is because they have
conflicting emotions know
only end up hurting you
and never bother?
- when not bother
i see it as a positive
you know something?
the way you write on
your books people approach me
and i believe that love
a kind of henry miller
you like to have sex just as often
when you have it you have it
- kiss, kiss, boob, tit
vagina ...
i am a man of simple pleasures
if simple
and i wanted to say that lately
're no henry miller
at any level
you know what? this place makes me uncomfortable
expected something like the real greece
this place is real
- what we do here the same?
it is supposed to have a great night
you know ... no place
to be spontaneous
and this is stupid and does not work
ok ... obviously
and stefano curse for doing this

jessy oh you're so right the great
commander is the deepest passage
of all the literary revolution

committed to you, with girls
and the life we ??build
together, the answer is a yes

to your old boyfriend after
his mother died? no, you know why?

and i hurt my children to my
work and to all who love

drink or maybe meet

do not talk to strangers
- well i'm not a stranger
we have known
before, in the summer of 94
you're confusing me with someone else
not
even we fell
- really?
vaguely remember
someone sweet and romantic
that made me feel that she was not alone
someone who was respected
that's me
i'm that guy
- i do not think

really? that thing?
- an important
yes, i know because i've been through this

across the forest
this letter is lighting a candle

if ... young
and it will be your companion
god knows i have many problems
and fought all his life logging
and being present with those he loves
and so so sorry
but you are his only hope
celine
my advice is this
those entering the
best years of your life
looking back from what i said now
these years are sometimes more difficult
and when were 12 mathew and vanessa
they danced all night with the
song "how deep is your love"
do not know
anyway .. celine will be fine, your
girls grow up to be examples
e icons of feminism
- good

to notice there is something below
maybe i should move to end
if the end head over
ok ... sure?
- yes!
well ...
ok ... if
ok .. here, postscript, by the way
certainly the best sex
of my life happened one night
in south palepanise
do not miss
my sexual being was to a new level
brilliant
look jessy can leave this stupid
game? we are not in one of your stories
ok?

i hear you
they no longer want to be with me anymore?
i thought you did not want to say
seriously but if so
fuck it, you're like
girls and other
want to live in a fairy
just trying to improve things here
i told you i love you unconditionally
i told you you're beautiful
i tell you your butt looks great
i try to make you laugh
- ok
hold a lot of your shit and if you think
i'm a dog that always return
then you're wrong but if
want true love then now is
real life is not perfect
if you can not see it then you are blind
i give up
what about this time machine?
what do you mean?
how does it work?
it's complicated
will i have to undress to operate it?
i mean ...
- yes, if it is a problem
i say closed and does not travel well
through time and space
so you're ready
jesus
- time and space?
continued
yes, if
you know sometimes i think about your letter
you know you ... do you live
southern palepanese?
yes, yes and ... we are here
and you think it might be tonight
