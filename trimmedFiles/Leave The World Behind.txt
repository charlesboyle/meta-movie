i can not.
swedish house mafia announced in
june 2012 that it would stop at
they wanted one last time on tour
within a week there were a
million tickets sold...
i like to start the day with music.
you listen, but in a passive way.
this is the best hit.
the best part is where the beat begins with
immediately after a pause.
i mean, it just started.
that's cool.
then it comes back.
it's so much...
the laundry has my stuff delivered.
i came here with only five clean t-shirts.
but now almost all crops.
now i have sixteen t-shirts.
i do not fit in this t-shirt.
i feel fat and bloated.
damn, i do not have a cap
or something with me.

not for anything apart.
how do they keep things
during that whole tour together?
madison square garden was
sold out in nine minutes.
jojo on the radio, sit next to me
members of swedish house mafia.
they are unlike any others.
they have made popular house.
they say two heads are better than one.
and then three?
they put you in a good mood.
their individual styles,
the way they merge.
we love it.
the stage consists of 26 kinesys motors
holding up three video screens.
two in front, one in back.
all energy comes from the front.
that's a lot of laser.
there's about 800 led panels.
what fiercely.
i do not think they've ever had.
complex such fireworks
these are the prg bad boys.
three pieces, one for each man.
it is an attack on all the senses.
it is very important that
we can sit on top of... us
because this is the biggest
we've ever done together.
stockholm home swedish house mafia

house mafia where everyone looked.

this is a dream come true.
i am already on

'partouze."
my father started in '89 a record,
plump house and loop records.
they spent a lot of deep tech
house, techno and acid house.
i fell in love with the energy and intensity.
'what is this?'
something happened to my body,
with the beats and bass...
and tomdrums, and everything was
built into something totally new.
i felt that the public would ever feel.
the audience will love it,
i can not be mistaken.
i had to find other people who did the same
.
i'll tell you how i got to know
steve.
he was a hip-hop dj.
we went on with the same people and
were grown together.
we saw that we had the same interest.
he ​​was the first of two turntables.
you could then nowhere
technic 1210 to come.
i always bought records and listened to him
because i did not record.
he said: you should not
listen to this music.
this is nothing, what inspires you?
i wore orange pants,
hair back, luminous t-shirt.
i was about to jump into his room,
and he was smoking weed... there
in his baggy trousers,
like steve could look like.
he had a lot of energy,
he was always happy and very witty.
he always wanted to do things.
he ​​had spikes and buffalo shoes.
a true raver.
he made hip-hop beats.
i was celebrating, puberde and drank beer.
he just wanted to work.
we went to the office of my father.
i had a cd, homework daft punk.
i saw steve's face that
something was happening.
that was what happened to me as a child
when i listened to techno.
the first time i heard that,
i was in shock.
he said: i do not know what happened,
but i got a musical orgasm from here.
i remember that he and i were in the
same world, from hip hop to techno.
wow.
what is it?
do you smell it?
yes.
have i done it in my pants?
what is it?
- i'm going to vomit.
i smell something?
- i do not know.
does it come out of my mouth?
- no.
what happened to your hat?
is there anything?
you pooped in your hat.
- is that it?
yes, i think so.
no, that's not it.
does anyone eat dog poo?
yes, it comes out of my mouth.
do you eat dog poo?
what?
what is it?
it comes from here.
it's that damn food.
software i discovered that you
could make music at school.
nerds as i got together and made a demo.
a programmer made
super advanced stuff on the screen.
so he left a square rotating.
then there was anyone in music.
then you had a demo.
computer whiz music, demo music, which is
the amateur version of techno and trance.
the better i became, and the computers
were, however how it began to sound.
you can look it up. it is very
fast and quite amateurish.
i remember when i heard that song
in the drum part.
it was funky, it was groovy.
we met in a restaurant.
he ​​was a kid that came within.
'boys' he said, 'boys, hello."
'my god, it's you, i just heard a number
of you. great."
ax looked at me with such a look:
where did that guy talking about?
he was very enthusiastic.
it was clear that he had italian blood.
i said: do you have a studio in stockholm?
i come tomorrow, what's your number?
he is a bit pushy, a little goofy.
- i am to 3 pm.
but you should know that i'm
from the south of sweden.
we are very reserved, very quiet
and swedish.
i pick some music, i take it steve
and go to the studio.
if you meet someone who loves to dance,
you have two dogs in a room.
they sniff each other poeperd
and run laps.
we said, 'you like to dance?"
we had to befriend.
let's get in the mood.
can you rewind something?
always the same hi-hats.
here we go.
say: greyhound.
how are you?
- i do not have it.
come on. would you like a glass of water?
i can not breathe.
we are three ordinary guys from stockholm.
do not break the illusion.
we are not ordinary.
what are you talking about?
one, two, three.
the performers are on stage.
austria
where are we now?
i can not ski.
- i do not.
unbelievable.
netherlands
the more you think about it, the more
you realize how far dance has come.
ten years ago, we had never been
at madison square garden.
suddenly we can play in any
stadium in the world.
czech
it blows your mind on
and open your heart, again and again.
i love russia.
whoever stops at its peak?
- what are we going to do next?
bigger than this is not it.
we would only repeat ourselves.
we realized that the biggest change was
to stop.
it's early and it might
not the best decision ever...
but it's still exciting.
it is obviously sad, but we also just
of: "finally." in a weird way.
it is an end,
but it is also a rousing finale.
the first time i heard greyhound,
i was freakin 'out.
i had rarely heard such a good song.
did you know they opened with greyhound?
yes, i knew that.
what do you do when you hear that?
- then i'll go, i'll scream.
then i'm going insane, as is usually
music.
ready?
start.
the winner of the grand prix, axwell.
hello, darling. with dad.
hello, you talk to dad.
at night, night, night
i sail with my boat
the stormy, turbulent waters
good public.
very good.
damn good audience.
the adrenaline poured through the webs
and we beat on the drums.
and then a quiet,
not very romantic hotel room.
i can not complain,
but i was in a whirlwind.
i get almost panicked.
i need to cool down.
i've thought of something.
would we ever get into that mtv program
one hit wonders?
"what's become of... '
right said fred hit,
and what has happened to them afterwards?
remember that group,
swedish house mafia?
they had a number
do not you worry child.
the three members are now
busy with their own things.
with less success than
do not you worry child.
one of them has become a crack addict.
another bought a lot of houses
he had to sell it later.
after a few years she made a reunion tour
where no audience was coming.
at number 10 one hit wonders,
swedish house mafia.
that could happen.
like i said, you have the feeling...
we got the key to the golden
city and have thrown away.
we could not continue and
may be even greater.
it was very organic.
it is rather the fans who swedish
house mafia made than us.
'swedish house mafia will we be?"
we were boys who made fun
and loved music.
we enjoyed every second.
you had the feedback after the
performances, the comments.
what people wrote about us,
she loved it.
then it was a festival,
then we got fixed locations.
we started it for fun,
not knowing what we put in motion.
we were not thinking about what we put in motion.
we planned anything.
are you ready for swedish house mafia?
we did not see it as a long-term career.
if we all had a dream,
this was our dream:
'are we going to go abroad? this is for the first time.
" so it went with everything.
"it's the first and last performance,
let's make it a party."
it was the right moment in time,
the right time for this music.
the right time for our music at that time.
we had found gold.
it has become a huge machine,
a monster.
this is the official number one in britain,
do not you worry child.
it's a good day today.
we celebrated six years celebration.
- constant, five days a week.
after two days of traveling.
it was not just alcohol that we consumed.
we did pretty much everything.
a few years ago, i woke
up after my birthday.
the ground was littered
with beer bottles, liquor.
there was everything,
everywhere you looked people.
i woke up and i thought, that's enough.
i threw everyone out,
on my friends after.
i said: who wants to stop this,
may join me.
if you want this to go through
delete my number and then not call me.
thus ended it.
since that day i have behaved decently.
it started with a bit of balls,
no responsibilities.
we only had to show up,
drinking and partying.
now we are at this level,
more is expected of us.
otherwise we are seen as failures.
i do not want to.
i feel that there is a difference
in how much we put into.
do you see what's in there?
bitch.
look at the lion.
that's the sound i was afraid of.
i did not want to hear.
they go in there.
do they go to the cheetahs in?
unbelievable.
- are they dangerous?
i hope you like it.
hopefully you are not wimps.
i'm a wimp, i admit it.
thither.
- lovely.
you can leave if you do not like.
- so you can leave.
i'm standing here.
you can watch.
i do not want it.
- if they lash out, i make them dead.
i promise you.
you can get them the best acclimate
by letting them lick your scent on you.
if he snort, then it's okay.
- can i remove my hand?
no, take your hand away.
- now?
now it can.
it's not a problem.
- no? okay.
very good.
you've done it.
- i did not like it.
did not like you?
no, it's not for me. look.
remember when i said two years ago...
we had to concentrate? us
all to swedish house mafia
i do not know whether we then used drugs.
we need to focus our subsequent
and our solo things have to give.
yes, you did.
- but nothing happened.
if we had concentrated our
then that this was not a problem.
we play here twice for 27,000 people.
to achieve that they deserve, the level
we need to focus on this.
a few months go into the studio,
leave our family.
or go back to sweden and
sitting there together in the studio.
you're talking about commitment.
are you just arrived?
- exactly.
many people ask this question:
is it really over?
or is it a beginning? pause as you
to do? your own thing
are you later maybe back together?
would you answer this question?
we all think the same way.
we agree with this decision.
we've just never talked about.
a few hours a week, everything is great.
we are nostalgic about the
music and feel the magic.
but then we fall back into a void.
there is something that is
not being talked about.
the times we tried
there to do... something
that was very laborious.
that has nothing.
instead we
swept under the carpet.
we have an opinion but do
not talk about. so it is.
no one likes to still fight?
axwell, fuck me
philippines, singapore and indonesia
it's stuffy in here.
this tour would be called
one last complaint.
we constantly complain when
everything is perfect.
we are looking for things
to complain about.
it's a mess.
i have never experienced before.
open up the window.
- now you complain again.
i just asked if the window was open.
- it's true.
we are always looking for
things that are wrong.
just enjoy.
we get older, it is different.
we draw less with each other.
we live in different places.
it's not the same.
we each have our own agenda.
we live always somewhere else.
swedish house mafia
we have not given the commitment...
where the group is entitled.
every friendship,
in every relationship-at-a-distance...
it is in the beginning very close,
and then goes out.
mexico 20 more performances to go
what a disgusting view, huh?
okay, just checking. billboard.
number 1, bruno mars.
yes. number 7
in the top 10 insanely
- ..
that's crazy.
- unbelievable.
why stop you as you have so much success?
we are working on a world tour...
and put all other projects aside... even
and say goodbye to our fans.
maybe you can take over from me.
i think... we had a great time.
it's like my father once said:
if the cheetah coming your way,
you need the cheetah floors.
that is, it has become so big...
and we wanted it really, as sebastian said,
close to a perfect level.
so we say: occasionally, cheetah.
they must think we're the president.
"no, three djs from sweden."
i see no crack.
no, i need to vomit.
i want to vomit.
damn it, where is it?
someone runs around with.
we went to australia and rented
a big house on the water.
we said: we're going
do not you worry child making.
damn, it's hot.
so warm is not.
he gives 33 degrees.
they say sharks are here.
you should not be in the water.
we do not do that.
i want to make music that
sounds like this view.
can we make music that sounds?
- yeah.
how does this sound?
i think a few notes higher.
maybe another.
another one.
that's him!
now i'm going to do the beats.
that's tight, man.
let's see if having that effect.
- i will try all three.
you mean...
here's the deal.
i want this meets
with a little angel sitting on my neck.
he did not take on?
he ​​can not record when he is tattooed.
how long does that tattoo?
- that depends on how complicated it is.
this took three hours
because it consists of several layers.
what silly to do that when we
rented a house to make music.
can not you also have a tattoo
in la? if i'm not mistaken.
this will hurt.
no one is involved.
we are here, i have my family
left, steve and his family...
to five days to work here.
i'm sick of it.
nothing comes off the ground,
we never get that cd out on this trip.
we must remain in the room
and be creative and have fun.
when he comes, he will complain
it hurts.
this is worthless.
ax and i talk with steve
if we have time for.
if he does not understand,
then we have a big problem.
there is the prodigal son.
- i did not think it would take so long.
that was a bad idea.
- the tattoo?
you knew that three months ago, al-
we are here to work.
yeah, but still.
- it's worthless.
it was not a great idea.
anyway, let's get to work.
we felt that we were going
in the right direction...
but we did not get very far.
and then we were off again.
at the same time it was not good
with swedish house mafia.
are we set to do tomorrow?
i do not spoil me, but it is tight.
- you play, so you should go.
i can cancel our things going for it.
we can do tomorrow.
you can count on me tomorrow,
i swear.
there are many things which
everyone time and effort into it...
without getting appreciation.
if i have 6000 meetings,
i do not put that on the spreadsheets.
seb has a lot of studio
sessions over beaten...
but i've never thrown him to the feet.
i do not care.
we do this together.
you know, we have had
with swedish house mafia. already well
why not let it at that?
we know we can not go against it.
we do not want a group
that is only half the bet.
no one is busy
it to a higher lift.
we want our friendship not ruin by accusations
that the other is doing too little.
when i have suggested what
i thought for a while:
'shall we stop
with swedish house mafia?"
we would like to announce
that this is our last tour is
we want to thank everyone who join
us in this adventure has entered
we came, and beloved raveden
after the show they wrote on their
website: it's over.
'swedish house mafia, forever in my heart."
'pockets, you have shit on your fans."
"something died in me, fagots."
'with the end of the swedish house mafia
house music dies."
'rewarding you so your fans, " mark.
"my greatest hope and interest has died."
'damn, i'm heartbroken."
'why, why, why?
no, no, no. do not do it."
they called me: we're breaking up,
fuck, this is nothing.
it's gotten so big so fast.
it's just really like you mean
and if everyone loves each other.
but energy is not pure.
it was one last tour on.
that swedish house mafia has successfully
no one can deny.
you have hits, have performed
in sold-out stadiums worldwide.
are not you afraid of a future without shm?
not really. we are now
here and enjoy this moment.
i look forward to what
is to come hereafter.
there is no comprehensive plan.
- exactly.
we have always done this,
brought our own music...
and played without the others
at large events.
we see this as the end of an
incredible journey we made as friends.
it just feels right.
we all saw that there
is an end to the dance.
we said: we have to do this.
we were looking forward to
to keep up with the group.
then we announced...
that milton keynes bowl
our last show in the uk would be.
we said: yes, there goes our last single in
premiere.
result, we had a deadline
to finish this thing.
if you tell 60,000 people that they will hear it...
do not you worry child
then you should finish it.
milton keynes bowl uk, 2012
you have had tremendous performances.
why is it this time so special?
it is the last performance of
swedish house mafia in the uk.

you should take one.
- of course not.
that's rude.
- you need to do him.
why?
- out of courtesy.
who decides?
- their culture.
there i shit on.
did you know that this was a theme park?
- oh?
it's so weird.
i do not see myself more as a dj
occur when i'm 40.
i'll still do it, but
i do not go on tour.
you never know how long this continues.
time will tell.
everything comes to an end.
i've cried myself to sleep tonight.
really?
- i have a hard time.
so it goes sometimes in life.
you should get rid of all the shit.
pity.
- anders comes back later.
i've reached a point...
i want to get things clear.
why can not we talk like adults about
?
what are we doing?
we behave like teenagers.
this is not from the ground.
i can not.
i concentrate completely on shm.
if you do not have everyone
sit in a line... feeling
which is quite annoying.
throw it out. if you have something
to say, say it . what's the problem?
if you do not discuss problems immediately,
let it sit.
it wears you out, you know.
but we want war?
because that would be.
we need to relax, okay?
so stupid.
i think steve left.
- where?
no idea.
curly took him to a car.
it is what it is.
it's over, you know.
this year there are a lot of things
happened which made me realize...
that we are no longer close friends.
that's the truth.
normally we say: "we have achieved
what we wanted to achieve."
this is also called as,
but maybe it should not continue.

i could book him. he said: good.
i also called axwell.
steve introduced me to sebastian.

yes, just listen to.
and who are you?
- steve angello.
okay, fine.

axwell, what have you to say?
in the beginning there was house.
at the end there was house.
and axwell is in the middle.
some of us have made mistakes.
the fact that we do not sit together...
and have said sorry to us,
is very unfortunate.
but i also think that it
had come then not good.
i think happiness is more
important for all of us...
become part of swedish house mafia.
new york
we have here today
members of swedish house mafia...
axwell, steve and sebastian, to help
the empire state building to enlighten us.
hello, new york. this is our first visit
to the empire state building.
how wonderful to visit
while it is lit with the swedish colors.
it is soon over.
the circle is almost complete.
it starts emotional feelings
loosen.
at the beginning it did not feel
like the end, that was so far away.
i did not think it would
be over so quickly.
do you regret it?
- sometimes. sometimes.
here comes sebastian ingrosso.
now look, swedish house mafia.
can we take a picture before it starts?
- with your tough outfit.
you need to chill, you.
according to him, this is the best outfit
i've ever had, especially when i do oil.
why oil?
alex, who am i?
- sebastian.
now?
- swedish house mafia.
we need
ax as the man who was always there.
i deugde itself from any side
in the beginning.
i made lol. i took it for granted that
ax and steve were there.
i could quietly celebrate with a
couple of guys, they expand it right.
four years later, i woke up:
what have i done?
but this year and the year before
i worked myself silly...
to ax and steve show
i wanted to give them something...
for all the years that she
me hand held above the head.
do you want to celebrate?
she says: i'm paris hilton.
i say: so what?
give me a hug.
i'm so hyper.
i'm going to fucking numb nightclub.
you have swag.
i have never seen so many people smile.
who can repeat after me they have
drummed at madison square garden?
i drank my earplugs turned off and
vodka, so beautiful it was.
yes, such a glass. i needed that.
if it continues, we use
at the end of the tour again coke.
and we stoned every time.
i think so too.
look at the last show.
back to the beginning.
why not?
- why not? hell
why have you chosen
miami to join swedish house mafia off?
we come every year in miami
for the conference.
so it was a natural thing...
to scatter our ashes
here so we can see that occasionally.
say hi to the guys.
good luck and thank you for
everything you have done... people
and the fun you people have donated.
we have this before without the others did.
then we go apart from the others.
so strange is not it.
we are all different.
it's hard to...
it's over now, anyway.
this was the end.
there are many among you
what is not spoken.
yes, it will never be pronounced.
maybe later.
you never know.
then we are older. hopefully we
will meet each other in ibiza...
whether we drink a glass of wine
together and talk about it, or not.
in the beginning i suggest us and say:
we are still swedish house mafia.
or: we are again swedish house mafia.
no, you better say...
- this is much better.
the last time you said...
i felt like i was
in the audience and everyone wanted to sew.
yes, this is, bam.
do we need later on?
yes.
are you sure?
very fast.
we should go and warming us,
the drums beat.
we need to get into the rhythm.
- i'm a nervous wreck.
last performance ultra music festival
miami.
i will always be friends with them.
but it is not the same in terms of work.
we had something fantastic.
it's always sad to see things disappear
you loved.
but we held our ground.
we can look back on it.
that's something i want to cherish.
fortunately we have friendship.
we have a happy relationship.
it's sad when you are at a standstill,
but it also has something beautiful.
we have together created something
and we were soul mates.
we have undertaken this adventure together.
it's not from lack of
effort that we're apart.
we just want to stop here, we
want friendship not screw up.
it could have been worse
we can throw... with chairs
and body can go together
with knives.
but we do not want.
sing, miami.
it can be louder.
i think i also speak for the others...
when i thank you for
this great adventure...
and for the love we have received.
words fail.
i'm happy, but sad at the same time.
madison square garden.
barclays, barclays.
i'm going to a certain number of times
to my brothers.
the vibes are strong. energy.
i'll never get over this.
- the most beautiful night of my life.
too bad they stop.
- but it's okay with them.
separately?
yes, but it's nice to see them together.
maybe they'll come back.
they should stay together.
everyone loves them,
it's a great group of people.
they were the best thing that
happened to me in my whole life.
people can not touch me, but
swedish house mafia apparently.
i can die a happy man.
we are still swedish house mafia.
miami, thanks.
you know we came,
we raveden and we loved you.
