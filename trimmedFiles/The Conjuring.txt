<i>it scares us
just thinking about it.</i>
<i>when you hear it, you're gonna
think we 're insane.</i>
<i>try us. please, from the start.</i>
<i>it started out small, like a hand
or a leg was in a different position.</i>
<i>then its head was looking up
instead of down.</i>
a completely different room.
it was moving around by itself.
ever think maybe somebody had a key
to your apartment and was playing a trick?
that's exactly what we thought.
but never once did we find any
sign or evidence of intrusion.
and this all led you to believe
that the doll was possessed?
yes.
camilla got in touch with a medium. we
learned from her that a 7yearold girl..
..named annabelle higgins
had died in this apartment.
she was lonely and took a liking
to my doll.
all she wanted was to be friends.
when we heard this,
we felt really sorry for her.
i mean, we're nurses, we help people.
so..
..we gave her permission
to move into the doll.
wait, you did what?
she wanted to live with us
by inhabiting the doll.
we said yes.
but then things got worse.
god.
<i>when we came home,
she was sitting in the hallway.</i>
<i>but we had left her in the spare room.</i>
debbie!! debbie, wait!!
we are beyond terrified.
we don't know what's going on
or what to do. can you help us?
yes, we can.
now, firstly, there's no such thing
as annabelle, and there never was.
ghosts don't possess such power.
i think what we have here is something
extremely manipulative.
it's something inhuman.
it was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.
and through that,
the inhuman spirit tricked you.
you gave it permission
to infest your lives.
what's an inhuman spirit?
it's something that's never walked
the earth in human form.
it's something demonic.
so the doll was never possessed?
no, no, it was used as a conduit.
it was moved around to give
the impression of possession.
demonic spirits don't possess things,
they possess people.
it wanted to get inside of you.
all right, that's good, drew.
you can shut it down now.
hit the lights.
so we got the church to
send a priest over..
..to bless the house and the occupants.
whatever was oppressing that apartment
was no longer with them. any questions?
yes.
where's the doll now?
someplace safe.
i mean, what do people call you?
uh, well, we've been called demonologists.
that's one name for us.
ghost hunters, paranormal researchers.
wackos.
but we prefer to be known simply
as ed and lorraine warren.
here we are.
wow, hear that?
oh. ha!!
oh, god, we're in the middle of nowhere.
are you so excited?
where's my "yes"? where's my "yes"? yes!!
i'll race you!!
i get my own room!!
are you kidding me?
no dibs on the rooms!!
so do i get to pick my own room?
or do i have no choice in that either?
well, first cute boy she meets,
she'll forget about jersey.
i can't wait.
come on, sadie.
sadie, let's go.
hey, come.
what's the matter with you?
hey, come on, girl.
all right, suit yourself.
<i> what's your name?
<i> who's your daddy?
<i> he rich?
watch your step.
coming through.
whoa, watch out, dad.
thanks. hey, nancy,
have you seen my wind chime?
you're so mean.
hey, mom, can i hang up
my wind chime?
of course. there's a line outside
you can hang it on.
honey, have april come in, okay?
it's gonna be dark soon.
okay.
come on, april!! mom wants us inside!!
look what i found, cindy.
<i>one..</i>
..two..
..three.
come on, come on, come on.
no peeking.
four.
are you guys done with the pizza?
i don't want it going to waste.
seven, eight, nine, ten.
where should i hide?
ready or not, here i come!!
okay, clap.
someone's gonna get hurt.
i'm okay, i'm okay.
second clap.
that's cheating.
clap.
all right, what did we break now?
it was christine's fault.
hey, nancy, can you go get me
the matches, please?
what's going on?
i wanna see, i wanna see.
move, move, move.
here, matches. thank you.
move!!
oh, man.
huh.
roger?
what do you see down there?
just, uh, hard to tell, you know?
it's an old piano
and a whole bunch of garbage.
agh. son of a..
wow.
rog?
come on up.
i don't want you girls going down there.
just relax. okay.
stop it, nancy. it's not funny.
we've got extra square footage anyway.
i'll check it out in the morning.
okay, show's over.
man, i'm fried.
something's up with sadie.
yeah, i don't know what her problem is.
couldn't get her to come inside.
we can't leave her out there.
she's all right.
i got her on a chain.
sadie, hey, be quiet.
thanks for making this work.
i know it was a lot to bite off.
it's gonna be great, isn't it?
i think it's great already.
yeah.
you still too fried to christen
the new house?
who said i'm fried?
mom?
hey. how did you guys sleep?
i'm cold.
it is chilly, isn't it?
you think maybe we could have bought
a house with a toilet that actually works?
tell your father.
and there was a funky smell in my
room last night. like something died.
problem solved.
roger?
roger?
down here, honey.
morning.
ooh. whoa.
this is gonna take some
serious elbow grease.
yeah.
oh, my god.
what are we gonna do
with all this stuff?
well, we probably ought
to go through it, you know?
there might be some antiques down here
worth a lot.
yeah, or just a lot of junk
the previous owner didn't want.
i'm gonna see if i can get
this furnace working.
yeah, that'd be nice. it's freezing.
yeah.
hmm.
sadie!! come here, sadie!!
mommy!!
mommy, where's sadie?
she's outside. you know, i'm sure  she's 
hungry by now.why don't you go and get her.
this clock stopped at 3:07,
and so did the one in the hallway.
that's weird.
maybe it got knocked around in the move.
speaking of knocked around,
what did you do to me last night?
sadie!!
april!! april!!
what's..? april!! what's going on?
oh, sadie.
we keep everything locked in here.
feel free to look around.
just don't touch anything.
wow.
this is crazy.
so all these are taken from cases
you've investigated?
that's right. everything you see
in here is either haunted, cursed..
..or has been used in some kind
of ritualistic practice.
nothing's a toy.
not even the toy monkey.
don't touch it.
oh, ahem. well, isn't it scary,
or doesn't it worry you..
..to have all these items
right in your home?
that's why we have a priest that comes by
once a month to bless the room.
well, the way i see it is:
it's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.
it's kind of like keeping guns
off the street.
why not just throw them
in an incinerator? destroy them.
well, that would only destroy the vessel.
sometimes it's better to keep
the genie in the bottle.
say, is the, uh, annabelle doll here?
right this way.
yeah.
what does that mean?
a very powerful demonic
has latched itself onto her.
so when you guys investigate
these hauntings..
..how do you stop them
from latching onto you?
we have to take great precaution.
but what about your wife?
what about her?
well, father gordon told me that..
well, that was different.
what happened to my wife
happened during an exorcism.
well, what's the difference?
excuse me.
honey, what are you doing?
come here.
you know better. all right?
georgiana?
all right, come on, honey.
you can't go into this room,
no matter what, remember?
let's see if i can find you
a little snack, okay? come on.
hey. what's going on in here?
all right, all done.
go get dressed for dinner.
here you go.
how'd it go?
oh, i think he may write
a positive article.
ooh, a nonskeptic.
that's a pleasant change.
yeah.
stop blaming yourself.
no sugar.
be right back.
not funny, nancy.
what?
stop grabbing my foot.
shut up, i didn't do anything.
yeah, right.
and stop farting.
it really stinks.
don't blame that on me. it's you. pew.
dad?
andrea, what are you doing out of bed?
what's that sound?
it's cindy. she's in my room.
she's sleepwalking again.
i've never seen her do this before.
i remembered you saying not
to wake her if she's like this.
no, we just put her back to bed.
hey, hey. sweetie. shh.
let's go back to bed.
she's okay. good night.
night.
<i>she's sleepwalking again?
she hasn't done that for a while.</i>
she ended up in andrea's room too.
i think kind of freaked her out.
does that hurt?
that's weird.
i don't know. will you do me a favor,
go see a doctor for that?
bye!!
love you!!
yes, i do.
i miss sadie a lot.
she was my best friend.
you're my friend, right?
yeah, let's play.
rory?
with this.
when the music stops, you see him
in the mirror standing behind you.
okay.
but you have to twist the key.
okay.
well, okay, i guess rory
doesn't want to see me, huh?
hmm. oh, well.
can we play hideandclap?
hideandcla..?
oh, honey, i don't want to play.
remember, you get to ask me
for three claps.
okay.
one, two, three.
four, five..
..six, seven..
..eight, nine..
..ten!!
first clap!!
ow. shit.
second clap!!
april.
april.
oh, i know where you're hiding.
give me the third clap.
i'm gonna get you now.
i can hear you breathing.
april.
april.
ha, ha. you took your blindfold off.
you weren't even warm, mom.
i was in christine and nancy's room.
<i>i gotta have some routes here,
or i'm gonna lose the insurance on the rig.</i>
that's like half of my rate, man.
yeah, okay.
i'll, uh.. yeah, i'll take it.
thank you.
it's a week turnaround. i start tomorrow.
we'll get through this.
yeah.
come on, let's go to bed.
stop it, nancy. it's not funny anymore.
i'm trying to sleep,
please stop grabbing my feet.
nancy?
nancy?
what are you doing?
christine?
are you all right?
do you see it?
see what?
there's someone behind the door.
what?
there's someone standing over there.
i don't see anyone.
it's looking right at us.
nancy, don't!! nancy.
no, no. look. look.
look, there's no one here. see?
ugh. it's that smell again.
oh, my god.
it's standing right behind you.
christine?!! christine!! christine!!
god, it won't op..
by the door.
it was behind the door.
honey, there's nothing in here.
there's nobody in here.
there was someone else in here!!
i was just sleeping, and then
i felt somebody grab my feet.
so i thought it was nancy.
well, honey, i'm pretty sure
that it was just a bad dream.
no!! it talked to me!!
it said..
..that it wants my family dead.
<i>mr. winston!!</i>
winston? winston?
get behind him.
where you off to?
i just gotta run to the store
for a few things.
in 15 years have you
ever been able to lie to me?
father gordon called. he's got
a case he wants us to look into.
i said i'd go check it out myself.
lorraine, myself.
i'm going with you.
i know you're worried
it's gonna happen again.
yeah, i am. i really am.
maybe it's just time we take a break.
write that book.
do you remember what you said to me
on our wedding night?
"can we do it again?"
after that.
you said that god brought us together
for a reason. right?
i'm pretty sure it's not to write a book.
i'm gonna get dressed.
<i>we've isolated the
disturbances to the attic.</i>
<i>i want you to listen for a second.</i>
oh, my god, that's it.
do it again, ed.
right now it's just my weight. but you
take the water coming off the pipe..
..combined with the wind coming
through the broken window..
..these boards are gonna expand
and rub against each other.
you heard it all through the house because
of these pipes leading to the radiator.
so this place isn't haunted?
no, it rarely is.
yeah, there's usually always
some kind of rational explanation.
girls, it's way past your bedtime.
who is that?
who's ever down there,
i'm gonna lock you in now!!
aah!! unh.
aah!!
help!!
andrea!! help!!
<i>hey, wanna play hideandclap?</i>
aah!!
cindy?
okay, now..
all right?
all right, come on.
come on.
there you go.
okay, you can just sleep with me tonight,
all right?
there you go.
there.
andrea? andrea!!
in here!!
help, daddy!! help, it's andrea!!
what happened?
somebody, goddamn it,
tell me what's going on here?
<i>fear is defined as a feeling of agitation
and anxiety caused by the presence..</i>
<i>..or imminence of danger.</i>
<i>whether it's a ghost, a spirit
or an entity, they all feed on it.</i>
take maurice here.
a frenchcanadian farmer with
no more than a thirdgrade education..
..yet after he was possessed, spoke
some of the best latin i'd ever heard.
sometimes backwards.
he'd been molested by his father,
who had also tortured him repeatedly.
a dark spirit made its home in this man.
now, if you look into his eyes,
you can see him tearing blood.
and like that..
..an upsidedown cross started
to appear from within his body.
all right, drew, you
can hit the lights.
oh.
did you personally
perform the exorcism?
no, i'm not authorized.
but i've assisted on many.
see, an exorcism
can be very dangerous..
..not only for the victim,
but for anyone in the room.
..but instead shot her in the arm
and then turned the gun on himself.
maurice had a very troubled life
with little to live for..
..and not even an exorcist
could bring him back.
which brings us to the three stages
of demonic activity:
infestation, oppression and possession.
now, infestation:
that's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence..
..which ultimately grows
into oppression, the second stage.
now this is where the victim,
and it's usually the one..
..who's the most
psychologically vulnerable..
..is targeted specifically
by an external force.
breaks the victim down.
crushes their will.
and, once in a weakened state, leads them
to the third and final stage: possession.
there's someone here
that would like to talk to you.
how can we help you?
there's something horrible happening in
my house. could you come and take a look?
you know, uh, it's getting kinda late.
but we do. there's usually some
sort of rational explanation..
i have five daughters who are scared to death.
i'm so afraid this thing wants to hurt us.
you have a daughter. wouldn't you do
anything you could to protect her? please.
please can you come and take a look?
of course,we will.
of course, we will.
<i>come on, jan!! open up!!</i>
<i>jan, what happened?</i>
<i>the top of your head turned black.</i>
you guys straighten up? thanks.
<i>don't be silly, it's a wig.</i>
thanks for coming.
hey, nice to meet you, roger. ed warren.
thank you.
so..
oh, my god. look at you all.
who are these beautiful young women?
this is andrea, the oldest,
nancy, cindy, christine..
..and april.
it's mr. and mrs. warren.
the girls feel safer and it's warmer.
i'm constantly turning up the heat,
but the house is always freezing.
it's not a problem with the furnace.
i mean, not that i can find.
it's gotten a lot
worse the past few nights.
there's this awful smell, like rotting meat.
it moves around the house.
uh..
what? what is it?
well, rancid smells could indicate
some type of demonic activity.
oh, my god.
that's to keep those doors
from banging at night.
otherwise, it's like:
all night long, just like that.
it stops at dawn?
uhhuh.
well, sometimes it's meant
as an insult to the trinity:
the father, the son and the holy spirit.
you know, it's the damndest thing,
but we also get all kinds of birds..
..that will just fly against the side
of the house and break their necks.
hm. really?
and the clocks stop at 3:07 a.m.
oh, we were hanging those
along the stairs.
something just kept knocking them down,
so we stopped hanging them up.
that's what i was talking about.
it was here when we moved in.
there's also a lot of stuff in the cellar.
show me the cellar.
<i>look what she made me do.</i>
you picking up anything in here, hon?
something awful happened here, ed.
those bruises, they from something
that happened here?
oh, it's some iron deficiency thing i have.
you know, with all that's been going on,
why haven't you just moved out?
i don't know where
we'd move to, you know?
we got all our money tied up in this place
and had a lot of repairs on top of that.
and i don't know anybody whose gonna
take in a family of seven indefinitely.
that's why we tracked you down.
we're glad you found us.
all right, let's get started.
my name is ed warren.
it's november 1st, 1971.
i'm sitting here with carolyn perron..
..who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.
okay, go ahead.
where do i start?
from the first occurrence.
i guess it was the clocks.
mom and dad tell me
that you have a friend.
his name's rory.
he lives here too.
why is that?
he won't tell me but i think
something bad happened to him.
do you mind if i try to see rory?
hey.
what is it?
we bought it at auction from the bank, so,
you know, we never knew who lived here.
well, lorraine and i both feel that
what your house needs is a cleansing.
an exorcism.
what, exorcism?
i thought that was something
that you do to people.
no, not necessarily, no.
we have to get out of here.
i'm afraid that's not gonna help.
lorraine saw something, which..
go ahead, hon.
i've been seeing the dark entity
that haunts your house..
<i>..and your land.</i>
i saw it first when i came
through your door.
<i>it was latched to your back.</i>
<i>and then i saw it again with the girls
when we walked into the living room.</i>
and it doesn't matter where you go..
..this dark entity has latched itself
to your family..
..and it's feeding off you.
even if we leave?
sometimes when you get haunted,
it's like stepping on gum.
you take it with you.
look, i gotta tell you,
you have a lot of spirits in here..
..but this is the one that i'm most
worried about, because it is so hateful.
okay, so what do we do?
can we call a priest?
i wish it were that easy.
performing an exorcism is an archaic
procedure. requires years of training.
and even then,
i have seen it go horribly wrong.
but before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.
it means we gotta investigate,
gather evidence and provide proof..
..and that's the hard part.
have your children been baptized?
uh, no, we never got around to that.
we're not really a churchgoing family.
well, you may want to rethink that.
our presence here could make things worse.
why?
because we're a threat.
and whatever you're dealing with here
isn't gonna like us.
so far it hasn't done anything violent,
and that's a good sign.
so we're gonna have our guy
do some homework on the property..
..to see what we're up against.
<i>judy, what are you up to?</i>
me and nanna got these
at the church's yard sale.
..of you and daddy in mine.
nanna said this way
we'll always be together.
you'll be with me and i'll be with you.
i miss you and daddy.
hey, hon.
yup.
you're not gonna believe this.
carolyn's voice didn't record.
what do you mean?
listen.
<i>my name is ed warren.
it's november 1st, 1971.</i>
<i>i'm sitting here with carolyn perron..</i>
<i>..who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.</i>
<i>okay, go ahead.</i>
<i>from the first occurrence.</i>
nothing.
the whole time.
i mean, it's no wonder they're
going through what they are.
that's the original farmhouse.
it was built in 1863 by a man
named jedson sherman..
..who was married to a woman
named bathsheba.
ed, she's related to mary towne estye.
she was one of the women
accused of witchcraft in salem.
after bathsheba married jedson,
they had a baby..
..and when the baby was 7 days old..
..jedson caught her sacrificing it
in front of the fireplace.
she ran out to that tree by the dock..
..climbed up, proclaimed her love
to satan..
..cursed anyone who tried
to take her land, and hung herself.
time of death was pronounced at 3:07
in the morning.
well, that explains a few things.
yeah, so does this.
her last name's walker.
she lived there in the '30s.
she had a boy named rory who
mysteriously disappeared in the woods.
then she killed herself in the cellar.
and that's not all.
so, what was the original 200acre farm
has since been subdivided and sold off.
there was another boy who drowned in
a pond here. he lived in a house over here.
and a woman who worked as a maid in a
neighboring home, she committed suicide too.
people who took her land.
<i>i'm sitting here with carolyn perron..</i>
<i>..who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.</i>
<i>okay, go ahead.</i>
<i>from the first occurrence.</i>
here's brad.
drew, this is officer brad.
officer brad hamilton,
harrisville, rhode island p.d.
hm. nice to meet you, man.
all right, guys,
help me get this stuff unloaded.
you take this.
hi, roger.
all right. when you're finished here, why
don't you hit upstairs, all right, drew?
you got it.
what's wrong with the chevy?
ugh, what's not wrong with her?
kind of put fixing her up
on hold for a while.
yeah. ahem.
hey, brad, hand me a thermostat,
would you?
what's this, uh, do?
when there's an instant drop
in temperature..
..the thermostat
triggers the camera to take a picture.
you've actually caught things on film?
well, yeah, that's, uh, the point.
why, uh..? why out here?
well, this is where the witch
committed suicide.
she hung herself from that branch
right above where you're standing.
<i>how could a
mother kill her own child?</i>
it was never a child to her.
she just used her godgiven gift
as the ultimate offense against him.
witches believe it elevates their status
in the eyes of satan.
mm.
wow.
that's a nice day at the beach, huh?
how did you know?
it's an insight. it's like a peek through
the curtain into another person's life.
mm.
that day meant so much to me.
we were driving along the coast.
nancy pointed out
how pretty the view was.
i thought this is a perfect opportunity
for a photo.
<i>we're gonna start fresh, you know?
a new house, a new beginning.</i>
<i>you should have seen roger and the girls.
i've never seen them so happy.</i>
cheese!!
they mean the world to me.
put your hand flat on the desk.
yeah, and take it off.
here we go.
see?
it just reveals to us what
the naked eye can't see.
pretty far out, isn't it?
yeah, it's groovy.
drew, you got the bolex ready for brad?
yeah, already locked and loaded, sir.
what? i had to go.
all the rooms are
coming in pretty good.
good.
what's in the bottle?
holy water.
presence of religious icons..
..will get a reaction
from anything unholy.
sort of pisses them off.
so i set these throughout the house,
see if i can stir things up a bit.
except i don't believe in vampires.
wasn't me.
brad, get the camera.
okay.
all right, it's 9:18, we're headed down into the
cellar where the door's just opened on its own.
i have lorraine and officer brad hamilton
with me.
let's keep the cellar light off.
give us a sign that you wanna
communicate with us.
hon, you all right?
there's definitely something here.
come on.
no.
it's gone. it's gone.
i got nothing.
okay.
well, like i said, it doesn't
always work when you want it to.
yeah, maybe the camera picked
something up.
watch out!!
<i>for a guy who doesn't believe..</i>
..you looked a little freaked out
when that door slammed shut.
it must have been a draft.
oh, that's funny.
a draft never put that look
on my face before.
i believe the clock.
it's 3:08.
let me see your glasses.
for you.
i think i might take some girls for ice cream later on.
what do you say about that?
i'm exhausted. i'm just gonna take a nap.
the late nights are getting to me.
that's probably a good idea.
why don't you get some rest.
i'm gonna take off.
i have a shift starting in an hour.
the house hasn't felt like this
in a long time.
i think the kids feel a lot safer
with you around.
no, this place.
nice, fresh country air.
they have such a beautiful family,
don't they?
yeah, that little one, april,
did you see her bring me pancakes?
we've gotta help them.
i know.
carolyn!!
are you okay?
carolyn, open the door.
carolyn, open up!!
are you okay?
i hear roger and the girls.
one minute.
thank you, daddy.
let's go inside.
i thought that was you.
hey, i hope you don't mind.
i got a good deal on a rebuild
at that wrecking yard in smithfield.
got a nice place here, roger.
lorraine and i always wanted
a spot in the country.
i'll sell you this one.
hey, hand me a wrench, would you?
hey, uh, it really means a lot
to us to have you here.
i gotta admit, i was a little
bit skeptical going in.
just wanna say thank you, though,
for coming out when you did.
i can't take the credit.
that's, uh.. that's all lorraine.
whatever lorraine sees, feels, touches,
it helps people.
but it also takes a toll on her.
little piece each time.
couple months ago
we were working on a case.
she saw something.
it took a real big piece.
when we got home..
..she went into our room,
locked herself in..
..didn't talk, didn't eat,
didn't come out for eight days.
what'd she see?
get out of here!!
i don't know.
and i won't ask.
i need to reload. you want some?
i'm good, thanks.
all right.
look what she made me do.
look what she made me do.
hey.
ed?
look what she made me do!!
ed!! ed!!
ed!!
dude, you okay?
hold up, brad. what's going on?
i saw someone. there was
a woman dressed as a maid.
ed? ed, we're getting something.
why do we need pictures of cindy?
she didn't trigger it.
who?
cindy!!
cindy!!
cindy!!
hey, over here. it's safe.
there's someone else in there with her.
i'm hearing another voice. here, listen.
follow me. this way.
<i>this is where i hide.</i>
cindy?
cindy?
where'd she go, ed?
windows are locked.
ed, where'd she go?
brad, get the uv light.
here, that's it. go, go, go, go!!
turn off the light.
get out of the way.
okay.
hit the lights!!
found her.
here we go.
that's where rory hides
when he's afraid.
hon? could i have april's
music box, please?
here you go.
thank you.
lorraine!!
no.
lorraine!!
lorraine!!
lorraine!!
lorraine!!
she made me do it.
she made me do it.
she made me do it.
ed!!
come on!! lorraine!!
ed!!
ed, i know what she did.
i know what she did. she possessed
the mother to kill the child.
she visits carolyn every night.
that's what the bruise marks are!!
she's feeding off of her!!
uh..
nancy?
nancy!!
are you okay?
nancy!!
grab her!!
daddy!! help!!
nancy!!
is she okay?
it's okay, i got you.
did you get that?
yeah.
i'll have the footage developed
and get it over to father gordon.
he's our liaison at the church.
i imagine we'll get a pretty fast response.
listen, when we get the exorcist,
i'll be back. but lorraine..
drew's gonna keep an eye on you.
<i>mommy?</i>
that's everything.
<i>mommy?</i>
judy?

what? what do you mean?
what?
oh, thank god.
mom, i'm sorry, i didn't mean
to scare you. i'll explain later, okay?
what the hell happened?
i had a vision of judy in the water.
i know it was some kind of warning.
i know it.
okay.
let's get out of here.
no.
look, ed, this is complicated
because the kids aren't baptized.
the approval would have to come
directly from the vatican.
father, we've never seen nothing like this.
yeah, well, neither have i.
father, they don't have a lot of time.
all right.
i'll push it through myself.
mommy? daddy?
