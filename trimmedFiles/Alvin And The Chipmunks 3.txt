okay. all right, one, two, three...
guys! one...
hold on. guys, freeze!
- where's alvin?
- hey, dave.
- where have you been?
- where have i been?
trying to board the ship.
already done that.
also, checked out our room,
dibbed the side of the bed
closest to the window,
ordered us a round of virgin piña coladas
and signed us up for parasailing.
alvin, you're too young for parasailing.
i thought we were going on vacation
to have fun.
don't worry,
family vacations are all about fun.
but first we're gonna need
to set some rules.
let's start with you can't call dibs
on a bed until everyone's in the room.
- good rule.
- that's right.
that's a good one, simon.
all right, so that's our first rule.
should we go over the rest of them?
dave, come on. "rules" is my middle name.
- hey, dave.
- alvin!
<i>this is your captain speaking.</i>
<i>all kids are now allowed to play</i>
<i>on the adults-only serenity deck.</i>
alvin!
<i>alvin!</i>
- we talked about setting rules, alvin.
- i'm sorry.
i didn't know the agreement meant no fun.
you're allowed to have fun.
when are you going to stop
acting like a child?
when are you going to stop
treating me like a child?
i'll stop treating you like a child
when you start acting like a grown-up!
i'll start acting like a grown-up
when you start...
hey, girls, not now, please, okay?
- lame!
- sorry, dave.
i need to get ready
for dinner with the captain.
we're having dinner with the captain?
no, i am. you're staying here.
i have to go apologize
for everything alvin did.
this is so not fair. not to us, not to dave,
and certainly not to the captain,
who i'm sure was really looking forward
to dining with me.
why don't i go speak with dave?
see if i can smooth things over.
knock-knock.
- what is it, simon?
- well, i would never say this to alvin.
goodness knows
he can be totally irresponsible,
but i actually have a suggestion.
you have a suggestion for me?
he's been driving me crazy a lot longer
than he's been driving you crazy.
all right. so what is it?
imagine alvin is a spirited racehorse.
that's your advice?
no. i'm not done yet, dave.
all right, so alvin is a racehorse...
and you, dave,
are his incredibly helpful jockey
who's there to guide him
down the racetrack of life.
but if you hold the reins too tight,
that racehorse is going to fight and buck,
which is no fun for anyone.
but if you loosen the reins just a little...
he'ii fly right off the track
and crash into the fence.
i know you want to protect alvin,
but, dave, sometimes kids
will rise to the occasion
if you just show them a little trust.
all right, guys, room service is on its way.
lights out by 9:00.
dave, question.
if we're going to be held captive
in this room...
because of alvin!
can we at least watch a movie?
all right, let's see what's on.
you know what,
why don't you guys pick a movie?
you're old enough
to make your own decision.
for real, dave?
absolutely.
- dave looks so elegant.
- have fun!
wait, dave, before you go,
i made something for you.
wow, it's really...
it's soft so you can sleep in it
and i made it with all the colors,
so it will go with everything!
great. i'll put it on after dinner.
you could put it on now, so everyone
at the captain's table could see it.
nice.
a real chick magnet.
all right, guys, have fun.
but not too much fun,
because i'm still very upset.
goodbye, dave.
and, hello, ladies!
i like my tail shaken, not stirred.
- where are you going?
- to the casino. i'm feeling lucky.
oh, no. no, no, no, no. dave said...
dave said, and i quote,
"we're old enough
to make our own decisions."
he meant we were old enough
to choose a film!
well, we're clearly not.
check out what theodore just picked.
what's wrong with this movie?
it's for babies!
which is probably why
dave treats us like babies.
munk up, theodore.
there. that's more like it.
alvin, please!
i say we go to salsa night!
in our pajamas?
i know!
alvin!
alvin! alvin!
and we have a winner.
ellie, i love these dresses!
you're so crafty.
thanks. it's what i do.
- sorry!
- what are you?
- we are the chipettes.
- hi, i'm eleanor!
my sister was just trying to apologize.
what's she sorry for?
stepping on my friend's foot?
or her busted, tired little dance moves?
no, you didn't!
yes, she did!
you better get those lee press-ons
out of my face
unless you want to meet my claws.
and, yeah, baby, they're real.
- do you wanna go?
- hit it!
captain, i'm really sorry
about what happened.
alvin, he's a kid.
he's just trying to have some fun.
there's nothing wrong with fun.
our pelican makes sure
that everybody on the ship has fun.
in fact, in port,
he circles the ship on a hang glider.
it's really quite amusing.
however, my number one priority
is the passengers' safety.
so i simply cannot have alvin put
himself, or anyone else, at risk again.
believe me, i understand.
if alvin breaks any more of our rules,
there will be consequences.
the last thing we want
is anyone getting hurt.
excuse me.
- hot!
- sorry.
hot!
unbelievable. gravy pants.
hey, hey!
- do you have a problem with me?
- you bet i have a problem with you.
- why?
- as if you didn't know.
i don't know.
ian? what are you doing here?
i'm working, dave.
this is your job?
yeah, not too many record labels
are interested in hiring the guy
who blew it with the chipmunks,
blew it with the chipettes
and passed on justin bieber.
twice.
look, ian, i'm sorry you lost your job
and your dignity.
but spilling things, hot things, on me
isn't going to bring any of that stuff back.
you're right, dave.
it's too late for me to get my old life back.
but it's not too late to ruin yours.
you want to ruin my life?
why don't we just start with this vacation?
if i see those chipmunks
break so much as one rule,
i'm going straight to captain correlli.
you're in my house now!
although, technically it's not a house,
it's a ship.
the point is, i'll be watching you.
like a hawk!
- theodore?
- please don't eat my brain!
why are you watching <i>jungle monster 4?</i>
alvin, how could you...
alvin?
simon?
girls?
oh, no. no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
i'll be right back!
it's dark.
you're up for an international music award.
that's fantastic!
yeah, it's pretty cool.
i guess. if you like a lot of adulation.
we fly there right after the cruise.
hoping to take home record of the year.
that would make you
the youngest winner ever.
i'm not that young.
i mean, i'm hanging out in a casino
way past my bedtime.
not that i have a bedtime!
no one tells me what to do.
alvin!
who's alan, i wonder?
anyway.
i'd love to chat more, but i've gotta run.
you're in a lot of trouble, young man!
you can follow me on critter!
alvin! alvin!
simon?
i wasn't betting. honest.
your winnings, sir.
oh, busted!
i didn't sneak out. i mean, i did.
but only to stop alvin.
- right.
- there they are, captain.
captain.
what's he going to do,
make us walk the plank?
there's a plank?
no, there's no plank,
but if you guys disobey me one more time,
you will be off the ship.
and you'ii miss the international
music awards. do you understand?
yes, dave.
absolutely.
what if we need to disobey you?
and why would you need to do that?
well, let's say that you tell me to stay put.
"alvin, if you move from that chair,
you're grounded!"
but then i happen to see pirates
climbing up ropes, ever so stealthy,
from the side of the ship.
now, it would be easy for me
to take my trusty old swiss army knife
and cut the ropes.
but i have to stay put. or do i?
yes, alvin, you do.
and what are you doing
with a pocket knife?
what pocket knife are you referring to?
come on, give it to me.
you could cut yourself.
so, i could have saved the whole ship
from robbage and pilgering
and you'd still ground me?
alvin, there's no such word as robbage.
and it's "pillaging."
but he does have a point, dave.
there's got to be times when you trust us
to take matters into our own hands.
i trusted you tonight
and look where that got me!
that's probably just the hot gravy talking.
you're all lucky captain correlli
has allowed you one more activity.
is it hang gliding, wakeboarding,
or bungee jumping?
no. shuffleboard.
man!
by my calculations,
it appears to be 10% shuffle, 90% bored.
that's funny!
thanks. you really think so?
you know, dave, i think i'd prefer the plank.
sorry, alvin, but this is what you get to do.
and i get to do something
i haven't done in a long time.
absolutely nothing.
brittany approaches her puck,
adjusts her stance,
looks over at me, quite annoyed,
wonders to herself
if i'm ever going to shut my mouth,
realizes i'm not, and makes her move.
and...
it's short!
a costly error, ladies and gentlemen,
that's going to haunt her
the rest of her career.
you can make all the jokes you want, alvin,
but not even you can make this interesting.
really? well,
care to make it interesting
that i can make this interesting?
alvin, what are you up to?
need i remind you dave is watching us.
simon, the poor guy hasn't had
a moment's peace since he met us.
he's exhausted.
check this out. in three, two, one.
lights out.
nap time!
time to turn punishment into funishment.
you get it?
i took the "pun" in punishment,
and turned it into "fun,"
but kept the "ishment." it's word play!
what?
hey, kid!
wanna make a trade?
that's a nice-looking kite.
yeah!
i can see russia from here!
come on, simon, grab on.
forget it. all i ever do is try to save him
and it only gets me in trouble!
this won't end well.
simon, do something!
seriously?
simon, help!
alvin's gotten himself in a bind.
looks like it's simon saving him again!
thanks, bro.
no!
thank you!
hey!
dave! dave!
- dave!
- help us!
guys! guys!
no! no! no, no, no! no! no!
dave! help us!
oh, yeah.
oh, no, no, no, no, no.
you want to go hang gliding,
sign up at the excursion desk
like everyone else.
- ian, you don't understand!
- i think i do.
dave seville is so special
that the rules don't apply to him.
- let go!
- no, you let go.
hey! come on! great!
oh, my god!
i need my pelican head!
help!
- ian!
- you idiot!
oh, no. no, no.
great. way to go, seville.
- me?
- yeah, you!
hey!
save your breath, dave.
they'ii come back for me.
in retrospect, this was a bad idea.
we're losing altitude!
i don't think i can make it much longer.
i'm so hungry. just one bite.
no.
- a nibble?
- no nibbles.
maybe i can just lick the glaze?
the glaze is what's
keeping you alive, theodore!
its high fat content
is creating a waterproof barrier.
i'm gonna starve to death!
actually, there are many other things
that will kill you before starvation.
dehydration, sunstroke...
an island.
no, an island would probably be helpful.
so if you see one,
you should definitely say something.
jeanette?
we're alive! we're alive!
good. because now
i'm going to kill you!
guys, guys, guys!
nobody is killing anyone, okay?
no matter how much he deserves it.
thank you, si. though i could have done
without the passive aggression.
look, we've got nothing to worry about.
dave knows we're gone by now.
he probably has
the whole coast guard looking for us.
meantime, why don't we all just relax
and have some donut?
did you guys want some?
theodore! alvin! simon!
can't you kick any faster?
it's been two hours, dave.
thanks to biannual pilates classes,
i have legs that won't quit,
but they do slow down.
take those feet off, let me kick.
they don't come off. it's one piece.
no quality mascot suit has removable feet.
take the suit off, then.
- i can't.
- why not?
i'm not wearing anything underneath.
look!
no, no, it's okay, i believe you.
no, look!
look, an island!
maybe the chipmunks washed up there.
kick!
faster! come on.
okay, there we go.
it won't be long before
a rescue plane sees our sos
and flies us back to civilization.
i don't hear any planes.
or helicopters.
maybe dave is coming in a hot-air balloon.
because those things are really quiet.
i don't think dave is gonna be
in a hot-air balloon.
but he is coming, right?
of course he is.
just maybe not today.
alvin's right.
we should prepare to stay the night.
what? you guys expect me
to sleep outside?
last i checked, brit, we're chipmunks.
we're used to living in the wild.
no, we used to be used to living in the wild.
come on, brit, it's just one night.
one cold night.
so we'ii make a fire. we're always
setting things on fire accidentally.
how hard can it be
when we put our minds to it?
and how are you intending to do that?
i will create a spark by striking this rock
with my swiss army knife,
which dave took from me.
i suppose you have a better idea,
smart guy?
as a matter of fact, i do, smart guy.
as you can see, the lens concentrates
the energy of the sun,
thus creating fire!
impressive.
thanks. thank you.
thanks for thinking that.
hot, hot, hot!
we have made fire!
so, what do we do now?
alvin! brittany!
we've gotta head inland.
if we climb to the top of that mountain,
we'ii be able to get
a better view of the island,
see if they're here.
all right, got it.
what are you doing?
- building a fire.
- what?
you know, one time in the studio,
snoop ran out of matches,
got a blaze going
with just two carrot sticks.
figure, how hard can it be?
forget the fire. we have to start hiking.
yeah, okay, dave.
look, it's getting dark-ish.
it's gonna be cold. i'm gonna build a fire.
we'ii go in the morning.
no, we'ii go now.
don't take that tone of voice
with me, dave.
i'm not one of your chipmunks
that you can just boss around
and stuff into a cage
whenever you feel like it.
that was you, ian!
calm down.
jeez, no wonder those furballs
would rather fly off the ship
than spend another day with you.
they didn't do it on purpose.
it was an accident. they're just kids.
i don't know how long
they can survive out there.
and you guys were worried. look at us!
we're warm, we got a great fire going,
beautiful night sky
and if a rescue helicopter comes by,
they'ii see us!
everything's gonna be fine.
good night, guys.
- good night.
- good night.
good night.
night.
theodore!
what? dave always turns off the light
after saying good night.
that fire was sort of the only thing
keeping us from freezing to death.
- yeah!
- can't you just relight it?
- how?
- with your glasses. and the sun?
all right! way to keep the spirits up, guys.
doing it, yeah!
- and what is this supposed to be?
- breakfast!
no, it's bark.
yeah, for breakfast!
i bet it's very good.
it's not.
it's been forever
since our last all-you-can-eat buffet.
crazy suggestion, guys,
iet's get off this beach
and let's find some real food.
if i know my horticulture, and i do,
this is a grove of mango trees.
then where are all the mangoes?
maybe the jungle monster 4 ate them all!
you were planning on sharing that, right?
of course.
well, good.
'cause it kind of looked like
you were gonna eat it all by yourself.
what? i would never do that.
i don't believe you!
hey!
yeah! winning!
what?
i'll make sure to save you the pit!
my acorns!
way to go, theodore!
come on, we'ii split it.
don't listen to him, theo.
he's gonna eat it all by himself.
i'll share it with you.
no. she's trying to trick you.
no, you're trying to trick him.
no, you're trying to trick him
by saying i'm trying to trick him.
he's lying, theo!
what?
theodore, i am so sorry!
oh, no!
my precious! my precious!
stop it! stop it! stop it! look at us.
one day on this island
and we've become animals!
did you hear that?
- what was that?
- jungle monster.
positions, everybody.
hold.
hold.
fire!
no! why?
please don't eat us, mr. jungle monster!
i'm not a monster, i'm zoe.
and i'm clearly a girl
who has been on this island for so long
that now she's imagining
that squirrels can talk.
we are chipmunks.
yeah, alvin and the chipmunks.
who and the what now?
i'm sure you've heard of the chipettes.
we're kind of world famous.
who?
maybe this will help.
- okay. stop.
- lame!
i don't know who you are.
awkward!
exactly how long have you been here?
well, i got here on a monday, so...
yeah, like, you know, eight or nine years?
nine years? wait.
you've been here nine years?
well, it could be eight.
what if we're here nine years?
what if we're here forever?
i told you, dave's coming.
i used to think that dave was coming, too.
and he never did.
dave henderson, my supervisor at ups.
i used to fly cargo planes for them,
until one day i crash-landed in the ocean.
- we crash-landed, too.
- really?
but our dave won't rest until he finds us.
right, alvin?
absolutely.
you mean i'm finally gonna get out of here?
i can't wait to go tell the others!
there are others?
i mean, can you guys imagine
being stuck here for all these years
without anybody to talk to?
i think i'd lose my mind!
chipmunks,
i'm pleased to introduce my friends.
this is rawlings, spalding, callaway,
dunlop, and, right there, that's nerf.
hey, girlfriend, you look good.
they survived the crash with me.
okay.
- hi.
- hi.
- hello.
- okay.
i'm theodore.
guys, dave is coming to get us!
no, not dave henderson. i saw your face!
it's another dave.
but, you guys, just get excited.
we're finally gonna get off this island.
she's funny.
in a crazy sort of way.
this totally calls for a party. who's hungry?
- yeah!
- yes, please!
- i'm hungry.
- we are famished.
yeah? let's go to my place.
is it far?
i don't think i could walk another step.
who said anything about walking?
we're gonna die!
oh, man! that was so cool!
i know, i know!
come on. come on in, guys! bring it in.
come on down!
yeah! wasn't that awesome?
no, it was not awesome.
it's a miracle we got here safely.
in fact, the odds of a chipmunk
getting hurt on a zip-line are one out of six.
why do i always have to be right?
ellie, ellie! are you okay?
i think i sprained my ankle!
you know what,
you should put some ice on that.
no, guys, i don't have any ice.
i live there in that tree.
i thought that maybe you did, though.
no, we don't have any ice.
just like we don't have any shelter.
wow, that's a major bummer for you.
- do you guys like bungee jumping?
- yes!
no. we do not.
listen, lady, maybe you
should just leave us alone
so we can focus more on surviving
and less on killing ourselves.
whoa, that is a lot of uptight
in a very little package.
i'm not uptight. i just don't wanna see
anyone else getting hurt.
criminy. what was that?
you know what, that was just a spider
and they live here because this is nature.
it is not just a spider,
it's a <i>phoneutria bahiensis.</i>
its bite contains a neurotoxin.
mr. fancy words. so what?
alvin, toxin? poison? neuro? brain?
that's not good.
side effects include changes in personality,
ioss of inhibition, dry mouth.
okay, calm down. i get bitten probably
twice a day by these little fellows
and i am still completely normal.
yes, normal.
oh, no.
alvin? simon!
chubby one!
girl chubby one!
brittany? jeanette?
i hope they're okay.
who cares if they're okay?
i just need them to be here.
and here i am thinking you've changed
and don't only care about yourself.
nope. and it's a good thing, too.
because right now the rage i'm feeling
for you and those chipmunks
is the only thing keeping me going.
shall we keep going?
ian, just keep an eye out for something
to eat or drink, all right?
all right. right there!
- where?
- that thing around your neck.
you're not gonna eat this.
this was a gift from theodore.
that explains it.
i was gonna say, it's really ugly.
like, really... wow.
- ugly.
- it's not ugly.
it goes with everything
and it's soft enough to sleep in.
yeah, and it's edible.
you will not eat my son's necklace.
he's not your son, dave.
he's just a chipmunk.
dave. where are you?
where are you, alvin?
all right.
i'm gonna crash.
simon. where are you going?
who is this simon you speak of?
you?
no, my name is not simon. it is
simone!
that's pretty close to simon.
and yet completely different.
would you care to join me
on my adventure?
what adventure?
the adventure called life!
okay.
but just until dave shows up.
alvin, alvin!
simon and theodore are gone.
they probably just went
to get stuff for the shelter.
it's all the guy can talk about.
still, it's not like them
to wander off like that.
could you please go look for them?
why can't you?
i have a situation of my own
to deal with, alvin.
right. how is eleanor doing?
she's fine. i'm talking about me.
it's been two days since my last bath
and i am a mess.
i can't get rescued looking like this.
oy.
theo! simon! simon!
theodore! theo!
si! theo!
<i>bonjour,</i> my friend.
simon? are you bungee jumping?
- his name is not simon.
- it is simone.
that's pretty close to simon.
yeah, i thought so, too.
but he's acting totally different.
the spider bite! that's it!
remember the side effects?
personality changes, loss of inhibition?
lies! who are you?
wow! simone is pretty cool.
it's simon, theodore. and, no, he's not.
<i>au revoir,</i> alfred.
alvin. it's alvin!
<i>c'est magnifique,</i> simone!
okay, theo, it's all you.
really? i've never done anything like this.
and you never will.
how can you let him do this?
what are you thinking?
i'm thinking, "when did my dad
wash up on this island?"
- what?
- we were having the best time.
why do you have to show up
and be so uptight?
me? uptight?
i'm not the uptight one, i'm the fun one!
the cool one. ask anybody.
who should i ask?
come on.
theodore, you can't bungee jump.
you get scared just watching a movie.
munk up, alvin.
a little help?
much better.
jeanette, these dresses are, like,
totally adorbs. i die.
thank you.
and i also made these for you, eleanor.
look how handy you are all of a sudden.
and in case you get tired,
i made you a wheelchair.
super.
<i>enchanté, mademoiselles.</i> a kiss.
a kiss. and a...
a kiss.
- what's gotten into him?
- spider venom.
yeah, yeah, he thinks he's some sort
of fun-loving french dude.
- really?
- now he thinks he's...
the most interesting munk in the world.
simon? simon.
simone?
i think we should
get to work on that shelter.
i cannot imagine
a better roof over our heads
than the stars in the sky.
what about the kind of roof
over our head that's actually a roof?
it's going to rain!
what is a little rain?
we cherish the water,
for it is the water that nurtures the flower.
okay. this is crazy!
building a shelter was your idea. yours!
great. great!
all right, guys, we're gonna build a shelter.
i need everyone's help. let's go.
i'll try. but i feel so useless.
- what are you doing?
- what i've wanted to do
since the moment i laid my eyes
all over on you.
what?
hey, you guys
are going to catch pneumonia
dancing in the rain like that.
you ought to be careful
kicking mud around like that.
hello?
someone could lose an eye!
that looks like fun.
- eleanor? would you care to dance?
- i'd love to.
- with me?
- yes, theodore!
i can't believe
jeanette's getting all the attention.
i'm the pretty one.
jeanette's the smart one.
you don't see me running around
trying to be all smart, do you?
i know! i'm the fun one,
- you're the pretty one.
- yeah!
do you know how slippery that dirt is?
this is ridiculous.
are you even listening to me?
simon!
alvin? you're starting to sound like dave.
no!
what are you doing?
building a shelter.
since i'm not the fun one anymore
i figure i may as well be
the responsible one.
really?
well, since i'm not the pretty one anymore,
maybe i should build a shelter, too.
yeah, good luck with that.
what, you don't think i could do it?
hey, i didn't say that, brit.
i thought it, but i didn't say it.
so you wanna play it this way.
he's so french.
be careful, simone!
let's do it.
oh, no.
now, wasn't that a pleasant ride?
good thing we don't wear pants.
okay, you guys, come on, come over.
- are you sure it's safe?
- of course it's safe.
i do this thing every day.
- jeanette!
- jeanette!
hold on, jeanette.
no, no. look into my eyes.
you have nothing to fear.
yes, yes. very good.
you are safe. bravo!
- you made it!
- you're so brave.
pretty.
double rainbow. what does it mean?
alive they're superstars, sure. but dead?
they're legends.
i'm talking about tribute albums,
pay-per-view funerals.
wait a second. you actually think
i'm in this for the money?
well, if you're doing it to pick up chicks,
you're doing a lousy job.
i'm doing this because i love them, okay?
look, if you wanna spend
the rest of your life
running around after a bunch
of spoiled brats, be my guest.
- they're not brats.
- really? even alvin?
you never even bothered
to get to know them, ian.
i mean, sure, alvin can be kind of a handful,
but he means well.
he's sometimes just
a little irresponsible, that's all.
but, come on, simon?
he's probably the most
level-headed kid i know.
if anything, he's a little too uptight.
and then there's little theodore.
dave, i barely cared about what you
had to say about the first two.
i can't imagine the big-boned one
is gonna be any more interesting.
forget it, let's just keep going.
up, <i>poisson,</i> up!
oh, no. this is terrible.
shouldn't he have come up by now?
simone! where are you?
zoe, you've gotta do something.
all right.
callaway, i need you to go in there
and find simone.
i know you can do it, little buddy.
you're kidding, right?
if callaway can't find him, nobody can.
simone!
told you.
i'm sorry if i caused you
any worry, <i>mademoiselle.</i>
but i have something for you.
maybe this will be a way to make it up.
it's beautiful!
where did you find it?
yeah, it is beautiful. where did you find it?
in a cave behind the waterfall.
i thought it would look nice on you.
but now i realize even the most precious
gem cannot compare to your beauty.
yeah. were there any other jewels
or gems or diamonds
or anything else in there?
by the time i found the gold,
i had already been gone
from my jeanette far too long.
what?
you guys, they found it. they found it!
and the best part is,
they don't even know what they found.
they think that it's just one bracelet.
which means that
the rest of the treasure is mine.
all mine!
what the...
what are you?
hey!
yeah, you're one of those honey badgers.
you just take what you want.
drop it. drop it!
you mess with me, <i>ése,</i>
i'll go <i>loco</i> on you.
hey!
give it back!
you can sting like a bee
or strike like a cobra,
but this honey munk don't care!
okay, brit, i'm all done.
if you want, i can help you get started...
this tree house is awesome.
maybe you are kind of the smart one.
thank you, alvin. and yours is...
well,
you did your best.
anyhoo, no reason we can't be
comfortable and stylish
while we wait for dave to show up, right?
brit, i...
i think i know why dave hasn't come.
you do? why?
'cause he's not even looking.
alvin, why wouldn't he be looking for us?
because i drive him crazy.
you know, the way simon's
been driving me crazy?
i mean, that's what i've been doing to dave.
for years.
no wonder he hates me.
don't worry, alvin.
i'm sure dave will come.
i mean, he certainly loves
simon and theodore.
simon? is dave ever gonna find us?
simon? i mean, simone?
i'm so sorry, were you speaking to <i>moi?</i>
yes! about dave!
are we ever going to find him?
i see you are sad, <i>mon ami.</i>
and i hate to see you sad.
i will help you find your friend dave.
you really think you can find him?
i know i can!
and then i will find this simon
you keep speaking of!
as dave and i have never met,
i will need you to describe him for me.
well, he's very kind and a good storyteller.
very helpful.
and he's about this tall.
is he by any chance a big, flightless bird?
i don't think so.
then these footprints must not be his.
jungle monster!
do you hear that?
yeah, it's my stomach grumbling.
no, no, maybe it's a helicopter! listen!
face it, dave,
no one is coming to rescue us, okay?
and my stomach noises are gonna get
louder and louder and louder
until one day they just stop.
because i will have eaten you.
maybe you're right.
maybe no one's coming.
maybe the chipmunks aren't here at all.
maybe they're gone.
i really messed up.
dave, it kills me to say this, kills me, but...
look, man,
you're really good with those kids,
really good.
they love you.
and i should know because i was really
bad with those kids and they hate me.
but, look, you should know
that whatever happens,
you did nothing wrong. nothing.
thanks, ian.
come here.
yeah. yeah.
ian?
ian?
ian!
the jungle monster's real! and it's angry!
or hungry. <i>allons-y!</i>
that means let's go.
great, a volcano.
of course!
that's why the water was so hot!
it's being heated
by the underground magma chamber!
- how do you know that?
- i have no idea!
the place where i get my nails done
always has the science channel on.
maybe i accidentally paid attention.
hey, guys, anyone up for a quick hike?
like, i don't know,
maybe to the waterfall or whatever?
not now, zoe!
the whole island is going to explode!
what?
guys, we've got to get off this island.
we have to build a raft, now.
"right now" iike, right now?
or "right now" iike,
after a hike to the waterfall now?
i've been hit!
by dave's necklace?
tell jeanette i will watch over her
with angel wings.
dave?
theodore!
dave?
told you we'd find him!
simon!
it is simone, but i am often confused
for this simon fellow.
perhaps we look alike?
- simone?
- ian!
hey, you found the chubby one.
don't worry, theodore.
nothing's gonna happen to you. is it?
what was that?
that's an active volcano.
okay, brittany and i will build the deck.
eleanor, you need to start braiding ropes.
jeanette, find as many coconuts
and mangoes as you can.
who knows how long we'ii be out there.
what can i do to help?
- dave!
- dave!
dave!
- you found us!
- hey.
we missed you so much.
i knew you would find us.
eleanor! what happened?
you know, just a zip-line accident.
- a what?
- i'm fine.
it only hurts when i try to explain it.
okay, you know what, never mind.
the important thing is you guys are safe.
alvin?
everything's gonna be okay.
hey, what is it?
i thought you'd never find us.
that you weren't even looking.
why wouldn't i look for you?
because i'm such a pain in the...
alvin.
i know, you don't think i'm a pain.
no, you're a pain.
but i'd come, no matter what.
arc de triomphe, mayonnaise, napoleon.
i get it, frenchie,
you come from a rich history.
well, guess what, we're all gonna be
history if we don't get out of here.
uncle ian!
what's he doing here?
it's kind of a long story.
don't worry, he's cool.
yes, for a pelican man.
yeah, nothing cooler than
a grown man in a pelican suit.
so, dave,
how are we gonna get out of here?
i don't know, alvin,
i think you've got this under control.
theodore,
you and eleanor are on rope duty.
dave and ian, we need oars.
simone, you and jeanette
are in charge of food.
- and, zoe...
- no, i know, i know.
i'm gonna go
and i'm gonna pack up my balls!
who's that?
another long story.
yeah! good work, guys!
let's get off this island.
this raft won't build itself.
go! go! go!
- heave!
- ho!
- heave!
- ho!
it's incredible, you guys.
very impressive.
just seeing everyone
come together to build it...
i just want to say...
it can wait.
wait, where are jeanette and simone?
i hope this is going to be enough.
did you hear something?
who can say?
when i am with you, all i can hear
is the beating of my own heart.
oh, simone!
oh, no!
somebody! help!
jeanette?
guys! guys! over here! come quick, hurry!
- simone, are you okay?
- simone!
why are you calling me simone?
- simon?
- yeah.
you're back! it finally wore off!
what wore off?
you were bitten by a spider.
it, like, messed up your brain.
is that why i think i see dave
and a half-ian, half-bird?
no, it's really me. and really ian.
'sup?
simon, where's jeanette?
she was out here with you.
jeanette? i don't know...
i do.
it's zoe. she took her.
simon, i need to know
where you found that gold bracelet.
what gold bracelet?
the one you gave to jeanette.
what? when did i give jeanette a bracelet?
on your date.
jeanette and i are dating?
okay, he's useless.
theodore, eleanor,
you're gonna have to lead the way.
i don't remember exactly how to get there.
i do!
which way, eleanor?
make a left. no, right. no, left!
i thought you said
you knew where you were going.
i do! sometimes i just forget
my left from my right.
that way!
okay, we just have to cross here.
are you kidding me?
guys, i can't do that.
but, simon, you already did.
no, i didn't.
that was simone, that was not me.
but simone is you.
he's in there somewhere.
you just have to find him, <i>tout de suite.</i>
because jeanette needs you, simon.
no, i'm sorry, i just can't do it.
all right, ian, get everyone to the raft.
if the volcano blows
before i make it out of here,
you have to promise me you'ii...
leave without you. got it.
okay.
dave.
i'm coming with you.
absolutely not, it's too dangerous.
remember i said
someday i may need to disobey you?
sorry, dave, but i gotta disobey you.
let's go.
you're not coming up until you have
every last bit of that treasure.
but the volcano is about to explode!
well, then i guess you better hurry, huh?
run, go, go. in you go.
get down there. that's right.
keep going!
<i>s.o.s.</i>
<i>please someone help me</i>
<i>it's not healthy for me to feel this</i>
<i>y.o.u. are</i>
<i>making it hard</i>
<i>i can't help it</i>
<i>see, it don't feel right</i>
keep moving!
<i>this time, please</i>
<i>someone come and rescue me</i>
okay! pull me up. i can't hold any more.
if you can still talk, it means
you haven't stuffed your cheeks yet!
yes! that sounds very good.
jeanette!
dave!
they're supposed to be
behind that waterfall!
that's right. that's what i'm talking about.
- zoe!
- no, no. not another step.
don't come any closer.
are you all right, jeanette?
i'm pretty freaked out,
and those earrings tasted awful.
zoe, you don't have to do this.
i don't?
i spent 10 years looking for this treasure.
it's the whole reason
why i came to this stinking island!
you mean you didn't crash-land?
they said that i was crazy
and they said that this map was a fake.
and now the treasure is mine!
run!
jeanette, come on, come on.
run!
no, you don't!
jeanette!
oh, no!
help, help!
oh, no, help!
you're going back in that cave,
and you are going to get me more treasure.
jeanette!
- simone!
- it's simon!
alvin!
no!
- hurry!
- come on, guys, go!
go, go!
come on, come on.
look!
come on!
run!
but where's dave?
- help me up!
- help you up?
is that what i'm supposed to do now, dave?
all i had was my treasure,
and now it's gone.
do you get that? my life is ruined.
and now you're gonna know
how that feels.
no, no!
it's tempting to blame dave.
i know. i've been there.
i wish i could get back all those years
i spent plotting my revenge.
all that time and energy, wasted.
all those pizzas
i had delivered to his house, wasted.
that was you?
not now, dave! all right?
you could let dave fall to his death
and i could go back
to the raft with the chipmunks,
become their manager again
and make tons of money.
so, really, i'm good either way.
but let me tell you something.
hate, anger, regret,
those aren't just members
of a girl group i once signed.
they're what consumed me.
and they're consuming you.
it's not too late to do the right thing.
or not. again,
i'm good either way, so...
i don't want to sway you.
what are you guys doing? help me.
please. help me save my dad!
hurry!
i got you, dave.
come on! help me, guys.
wow!
there they are!
come on!
faster!
hurry! hurry!
let's go, go, go!
oh, no!
- get up!
- hurry!
- come on! come on!
- come on!
run!
grab the oar!
come on! come on, guys!
paddle!
come on! paddle!
faster! come on, hurry!
now we'ii never get to perform
at the international music awards.
i guess now we're the losers.
jeanette, i don't know what to say.
i guess i was just so obsessed
with finding that treasure
that i kind of... i lost it.
and i'm...
i'm really sorry.
we both are.
well, apology accepted.
here, i want you to have this.
really?
look, dunlop, this is a new beginning
for both of us.
i hope you don't mind.
simone gave it to me.
i don't mind.
you know, jeanette,
even the most perfect gem
cannot compare to your beauty.
- dave?
- yes, alvin?
i just wanted to say
now that we're not all, you know, dead,
sorry.
sorry.
sorry i was acting like a child on the ship.
and kind of maybe ruined
our family vacation.
sometimes a racehorse
needs a little room to run.
yes. yeah. i like where your head's at.
that is very wise, david.
'sup?
what, no love for uncle ian?
- you put us in cages!
- you put us in cages!
seriously? are we still talking about that?
new subject, i saved dave's life.
okay, but i'll be watching you, mister.
alvin, you still have
that pocket knife i gave you?
knife? right, sorry, i meant to give it back.
i want you to keep it.
really?
maybe you can use it
to signal that helicopter.
what?
- hey!
- down here!
hello!
it's me, ian hawke! jet records!
guys, circle around!
<i>everything's okay. we got you, guys!</i>
it's good to be back, huh?
sure is.
sold zoe's story to hollywood.
huge bidding war.
keira knightley is interested.
i'm thinking fiddy cent for me.
thank you!
- thank you!
- thank you.
- you're a great audience.
- we love you!
i'm sorry, sir, that's full.
we're gonna have to gate-check those.
are you gonna charge me 25 bucks a bag?
of course not, sir.
it's $25 for the first bag
and $40 for each additional bag.
i'm a little chilly.
would you mind adjusting the vent?
but of course.
- you wrinkled my business magazine.
- sorry.
guess i'll have to read this.
she's pretty.
wait, that's me.
all right, head count.
you like my jungle monster costume?
eleanor made it for me.
yeah! out of a barf bag!
nice.
where's alvin?
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is your captain speaking.</i>
<i>we're cleared for an on-time departure</i>
<i>for timbuktu.</i>
<i>if timbuktu is not for you,</i>
<i>please alert the flight attendant</i>
<i>by pressing your call button.</i>
alvin!
<i>thank you for choosing airalvin.</i>
<i>enjoy your flight!</i>

we're about to take off.
