we're giving up on the mom?
- she's 20% at best,
jeff, we gotta move on the boy,
it's the only choice,
this one's getting away from him,
- shrink-wrap, don't talk like i'm not here,
we've been here for 16 hours,

to your bedroom, ok? right now.
mr, talley?
- yes?

<i>i'm sorry, jeff.</i>
<i>joe, listen,</i>

<i>louise? louise, come back,</i>
come on, louise, where's that patch?

<i>dennis, listen, i...</i>

what?
what? what are they doing?
what?
- talk to me, dennis.
yeah, yeah, i'm here,
- listen to me. listen to me carefully.
the sheriff's playbook
is to make you dead.
first they're gonna
shoot out those cameras,
and then they're gonna shoot you.
am i clear?
what are you talking about?
- i'm trying to save your life!
i don't understand what...
- shut up! i'm trying to save your life.
but you said you weren't the guy,
<i>i am the guy, dennis,</i>
<i>i am the guy.</i>
tac sergeant,
pull your people back 50 yards,
hold it, you turned
authority of this situation over,
i'm reassuming command,
what are you waiting for?
disregard,
you don't give orders to my men,
now, ten minutes ago you called and
told me to shoot out the cameras, now...
you shot out the cameras?
i give you great intel like that and you
just piss it away? way to go, big time,
i am not gonna let you step back in
after you stepped out,
this is my town,
- captain shoemaker!
i invited you into my jurisdiction,
dennis says he doesn't trust me anymore,
says he's gonna shoot a hostage
if he doesn't talk to talley,
right now,
the name of the shooter
in the house is mars,
you're gonna want to
run that through your database,
your next question is:
how did i get that information?
the little boy in the house called me
on his sister's cell phone,

what you've been seeing
is footage taken only minutes ago.
we're not yet sure exactly who
the rescued hostage is,
<i>but it appears to be an adult male.</i>
if our sources are correct,
it could be walter smith,
<i>owner of the home...</i>
smith is on his way to the hospital,
<i>smith worries me.</i>
he knows his place in the food chain,
he'll be good,
and so do we.
if we don't deliver that dvd,
<i>we're going to need the accountant alive.</i>
now get somebody over there
and make sure we don't lose him,
<i>visiting hours are now over.</i>
triage,
someone at the information booth
is asking for walter smith,
hello?
i need to ask if you're
a member of the smith family,
i'm sorry, but i'm only
permitted to inform you
that mr, smith was deceased on arrival,
and that all other inquiries
must be made tomorrow morning
through the county coroner's office,
<i>if you'd like, i could give you the...</i>
hello?

yeah,
i know mars killed my cop,
but smith's death is on you, man,
things just got a lot more complicated,
didn't they, dennis?
not to mention the fact
that helicopters are very expensive,
gotta pay for the fuel, the pilot...
chief of police,
you know what cops do
when they retire, dennis?
they play golf,
i don't want to play golf,
i hate fucking golf,
i want a house on the golf course,
i want that,
walter smith talked to me before he died,
i know about the money,
i don't know shit about money, man, i don't
know shit about what you're talking about,
i'm talking about a transaction,
you want a helicopter,
i want a house on the golf course,
fifty thousand,
maybe you can negotiate
with the sheriffs for that,
no, no!
no,
shit,
half,
i'll give you half, ok?
that's, like... two million, ok?
half is good,
all right, sell it to your crew,
jennifer and tommy stay in the house,
the three of you
down here in the courtyard,

how do i know
the pilot's not gonna shoot me?
let me worry about the pilot,
you just make sure he gets that bag,

<i>heaven... can... wait.</i>
i'm the one who did this, i'm
the one who had the balls, i made the deal,
<i>fine, whatever, just get us out,</i>
i'm getting us out, kevin,
what do you think i'm doing?
you're just making it worse,
- look, i always take care of you,
bullshit,
that's the way it is, kevin,
always has been and always will be,
always, ok?
what... what if they just want
to get us outside just to shoot us?
they could have killed us,
like, a million times, kev,
but they didn't,
because talley wants to get paid,
yeah, get paid and then shoot us,
<i>we're leaving,</i>
wait, leaving where?
we're going on a helicopter ride,
no, no, i don't want to,
i'm not your girl,

this indoor pool area, any questions?
it's all there!

- ok, let's go,
where's...
what's this?
this wasn't what we discussed,
this wasn't what we talked about,
three people in the chopper,
that's all it can carry, dennis,
i thought you were the man in charge,
isn't that what you told me?
you said, i'm the man,
- i am the man! i am in charge!
prove it,
- mars, leave her!
jenny and i aren't going nowhere,
dennis, the man that owns
this house is a criminal,
so are his friends,
this money belongs to them,
you want more money?
- they'll come after you and fuckin' kill you,
you want more fucking money?
you just chose
the wrong house on the wrong day,
i'm not lying,
- bullshit,
the only thing
i lied to you about was smith,
he's not dead, you didn't kill anybody,
that means that you and your brother
can still beat the hard shit,
just walk out of here with me,
put those guns down and walk out now,
come on, don't let him fuck this up,
- dennis, it's fucked,
they're gonna shoot us
as soon as we get through the gate,
you're lying to me!
- shoot him,
what the fuck is that?
- i'm sorry, i'm sorry,
shoot him!
i'm gonna turn around,
- you will not,
i'm gonna turn around
and walk out of here,
and i will call you on the phone,
- dennis, come on, come on, den,

so you gotta choose, me or mars,
i choose the money,
oh, you choose the money,
you choose the money?
what do you think of that?
- done?
chief talley,
the situation
has clearly gotten away from you,
your flagrant disregard for protocol
has unnecessarily placed yourself
and my officers in the line of fire,
my opinion? you remain in command,
there's a probability of a negative outcome,
jeff!
what are you doing?
- no, jeff, jeff, jeff, jeff, jeff,
you've just made it easier, chief,
you're done, you're finished,
chief talley? the fbi's here at
the barricade and they're asking for you.
where's chief talley?
laura shoemaker, sheriff's department,
i'm in command,
are you talley?
walter smith and his family are witnesses
under federal protection,
chief, the us government would like to
thank you for your service and cooperation,
chief, move, now,
chief talley is no longer in command here,
this is a federal matter now, ma'am,

all you have to do is stay put
and leave the rest to my men.
when they recover the dvd,
you recover your family.
counterfeit feds,
must be very expensive,
<i>maybe they're real,</i>
<i>and maybe not.</i>
<i>the less you know, the better for you.</i>
