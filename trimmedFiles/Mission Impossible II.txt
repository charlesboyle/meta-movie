<font color="#808080">man :</font> well, dmitri,
every search for a hero...
must begin with something
that every hero requires- -
a villain.
therefore, in the search
for our hero, bellerophon,
we created a monster,
chimera.
i beg you, dmitri,
come to sydney...
and accompany me
to atlanta immediately.
however we travel,
i must arrive at my destination...
within 20 hours of departure.

folks, we're two- and- a- half hours from atlanta.
look out your window now.
we have a great view of the rocky mountains.
you keep staring at that watch as if
your life depended on it, doctor.
oh, yes.
i suppose i'm a bit anxious.
you'll soon be with old friends.
i'm with an old friend now, dmitri.
i'm sorry it couldn't be
under happier circumstances.
i'm sorry too.
you are sorry and i am sorry.
you don't know gradski
thought the world of you.
did he... know...
before the end
that you two had succeeded?
yes, he knew. just- -
not in time to save him.
<font color="#d900d9">(sighs)</font> no.
after you've been infected with chimera
for 20 hours, nothing can save you.
not even bellerophon.
you can carry them
together... safely?
yes.
and you'll get us to safe place
with them in atlanta, thank god.
this is your captain again.
we've experienced a slight...
but abrupt drop in cabin pressure.
as a precaution,
i've released the oxygen masks.
- <font color="#d900d9">(passengers murmuring)</font>
- please put them on and sit back, relax.
there's nothing
to worry about.
are you concerned?
not so far.
just put on your oxygen mask.
i'll see what's going on.
okay.
denver center,
this is trans- pac 2207, 747 heavy.
we're unable to maintain
cabin pressurization.
we've initiated a descent
to one six thousand.
captain- -
it seems we have
a problem, dmitri.
you keep calling me dmitri.
you really shouldn't.
you are not dmitri?
no.

no, no.
no need to apologize.
now, miss hall, my associate has
your necklace in a very safe place.
but obviously we do feel the alarm
should have gone off a little sooner.
- isn't that right, miss hall?
- hmm? oh, absolutely.
much, much too long, i'd say.
under the circumstances,
i think we'd recommend...
resetting the sensors
to respond to a lighter load.
how do you feel
about 40 kilos, miss hall?
perfect.
shall we?
- miss hall.
- hmm?
haven't you forgotten something?
what are you trying to do, señorita?
rob me?

i'm missing something here, aside
from my half- million- pound necklace.

i could've walked out of there

at least you walked.

once again i need your help.
just as in the old days, huh?
when you saved our lives,
saved our very sanity.
dmitri...
we have this little problem.
every search for a hero...
must begin with something
that every hero requires- -
a villain.
therefore, in the search
for our hero, bellerophon,
we created a monster, chimera.
i beg you, dmitri,
come to sydney and accompany me
to atlanta immediately.
however we travel,
i must arrive at my destination...
within 20 hours of departure.
i fear i can entrust this
to no one but you.
dmitri, as we say,
i'm sorry and you're sorry.
do you have any idea
what the hell he's talking about?
- an idea? yeah.
- like?
like it's a good idea
to pick him up in a hurry...
and a bad idea to fly him
on a commercial carrier.
- is he still in sydney?
- dr. vladimir nekhovich is dead.
so is his colleague gradski,
but that happened earlier.
we had nekhovich on a flight from
sydney that crashed in the rockies.
- dead?
- are you listening to me?
if he didn't want
to go anywhere without me,
how did you get him
on that flight?
oh, you were there.
when i couldn't find you,
i had to replace you.
sean ambrose was the obvious choice.
now, he doubled you, what,
two or three times?
- twice.
- what did you think of him?
we had our reservations
about each other.
isn't it a little late
to be asking me that?
no, not necessarily.
airline records...
list a captain harold macintosh
as the pilot of flight 2207.
as far as the media and all
government agencies are concerned,
captain macintosh
died on the flight.
but in fact, he missed it.
he did, however,
make the next flight...
in cargo.
stuffed into a rather small suitcase,
considering his size.
now, someone on that flight
planned an operation...
designed to bring the plane down
and make it look like an accident.
someone skillful enough to bring
the whole thing off without a hitch.
so there's one thing we know
that ambrose doesn't.
you do think it was ambrose?
you're not surprised?
sean feels he hasn't done the job unless
he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
the question is why? what was this,
uh, chimera, nekhovich was carrying?
only ambrose knows that.
in any case, you must recover this- -
whatever- - chimera, and bring it to us.
in order to do that, i have to figure
out how he plans to make money with it.
that is where miss hall comes in.
excuse me?
miss hall and ambrose
had a relationship...
which he took very seriously.
she walked away, and he's been
wanting her back ever since.
we believe she's our surest
and quickest way of locating him.
and then what?
well, make sure
she continues to see him,
gets him to confide in her,
and report to you.
you made it sound as if i was recruiting
her for her skills as a thief.
well, then i misled you,
or you made the wrong assumption.
either way, we're asking her
to resume a prior relationship,
not do anything
she hasn't already done.
voluntarily, i might add.
no, she's got no training
for this kind of thing.
what, to go to bed with a man
and lie to him? she's a woman.
she's got all
the training she needs.
i don't think
i can get her to do it.
- you mean it'll be difficult.
- very.
well, this is not mission difficult,
mr. hunt, it's mission impossible.
difficult should be
a walk in the park for you.
i'm open to suggestion.
if you can think of a quicker way,
you're welcome to try.
by the way, you might take a look at these...
if you have any further qualms
about getting her to do the job.
<font color="#d900d9">(woman vocalizing)</font>
how many people are capable
of something like that?
sean ambrose, for one.
right.
this wasn't what
i had in mind, nyah.
but it is what you'd
like me to do.
what? oh, let my conscience
be my guide, is that it?
something like that.
i don't have a conscience.
i'm a bloody thief.
are you gonna try
and force me to do this?
generally, i don't favor
coercing someone,
not when there's a chance
my life could end up in their hands.
- is that the only reason?
- can you think of a better one?
me? no.
but i was just hoping that you might,
thinking that somewhere, this got
personal as well as physical!
ok, ok would it make you feel any better
if i didn't want you to do this?
- yeah, much.
- then feel better!
you know, sean will never
be anything but suspicious...
if i pitch up saying,
"hey, honey, i'm home. "
what wouldn't
make him suspicious?
that i needed him
in some urgent way.
destitute.
in serious trouble.
the kind i couldn't possibly
sort out myself.
serious trouble, nyah, is something
that i can always arrange.

to get you out.

- so we've got him!

tell me who you've run into
at ambrose's.
near as i can tell, there's about a half
dozen other blokes about the place.
maybe more.
hugh stamp, old friend of sean's.
he's the only one i recognize.
and a bit of a creep and then some.
we know him. he's over your left
shoulder, looking at you right now.
ambrose has photos of newspapers
with money piled on them.
thirty seven million

what's that about?
bids from possible chimera buyers.
ambrose is meeting
some bloke in the bar.
big bloke. ginger hair.
they're into something.

- checking now, ethan.
john mccloy,
ceo biocyte pharmaceuticals.

in a hostile takeover.
<font color="#808080">ethan :</font>
he was nekhovich's boss.
<font color="#808080">luther :</font>right. he worked for him
as a research scientist at biocyte.
ambrose is showing something
to mccloy on a digital camera.
<font color="#808080">ethan :</font> whatever mccloy's
looking at, he's not happy about it.
ambrose just pulled...
the camera's memory card
and put it into an envelope.
put it in his inner left
jacket pocket.

roger that.
nyah. nyah, ambrose
is on his way back to you.
- there's an envelope inside- -
- his left jacket pocket.
that's right.
- where do i meet you?
- betting table 12, off the paddock.
- are you sure you're up to this?
- i'll muddle through.
- there you are!
- see anything you like?
well, yeah.
"naturally vain."
but they're about to close
the betting, and i haven't a bean.
- nyah!
- would you mind terribly?
not at all.
but, um, you are gonna pay for it.

- i have no doubt.
hold on.

- to win?
- what else?
- billy, make sure nyah's not followed.
- no worries, mate.

okay, he's coming up

is the price of health,

- what is this?
- a visit from an old friend.
<font color="#d900d9">(panting)</font> you crashed on the plane.
you're dead.
dead, certainly.
but dead is a little extreme.
on the other hand, when my colleague
gradski had your pulse...
and your blood pressure,
he had less than a day to live.
you are infected with chimera,
my friend.
no use, my friend.
the medical staff
wants no part of this.
doctors don't fancy the idea
of dying any more than anybody else.
how could i possibly be infected?
that's exactly what gradski said
you've got the antidote,
you miserable bastard!
- you stole bellerophon! all of it!
- my, my, my.
i need it! i need it now,
you whacked- out russian gypsy!
and what about gradski, who you
deliberately infected with chimera?
how was i to know they needed...
to be treated with bellerophon
within 20 hours?
- by asking me.
- you still don't get it, do you?
i needed to know just how bad
the disease was in the real world,
not just the lab.
you were genetically splicing
together strains of influenza...
to create a cure for all influenzas.
but you were also creating
a disease so terrible in chimera,
the cure would be priceless.
i needed chimera in order
to peddle bellerophon.
it's not that difficult
to understand, is it?
look, i've got the virus.
you've got the cure.
i need them both.
time was a shot of penicillin
would knock off...
every bloody bug in the zoo.
not anymore.
if i couldn't make money killing
the microscopic little shits out there,
well, you'd help me put one out
there that i could make money on.
well, there it is.
i've confessed.
i, john c. mccloy,
am in business to make money.
now, forget any deal you may have
made with that thug ambrose.
get me treated,
and let's go back to work.
you know,
i think it's a little late for that.
do give my regards to gradski...
if you see him.
well...
i've heard...
<font color="#808080">normal voice :</font>
all i need to hear.
nyah...
it's imperative that we do nothing
to alarm ambrose.
what?
you told me to get out of there
as soon as possible.
- i thought you were here to collect me!
- shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!
listen to me.
there's no time to talk.
it is critical,
absolutely critical,
that you do whatever ambrose asks.
do you understand me?
don't worry.
it will all be over...
very soon.
<font color="#d900d9">(laughs)</font>
that's a promise.
go on.
go on. off you go.
<font color="#d900d9">(sighs)</font>
luther, we know this much.
nekhovich gets on a plane...
to go to the center for
disease control in atlanta.
he's carrying a virus
he created, chimera,
and the cure for that virus,
bellerophon.
ambrose doesn't have the virus.
that's why ambrose needs mccloy.
so we go into biocyte, kill chimera,
ambrose has a cure
without a disease,
and we're home free.
you were right.
hunt stung mccloy tonight.
so he knows.
he'll be going into biocyte.
good. then we'll know
where he'll be, don't we?
well done, hugh.
well done.

- that's not exactly it.
- sorry, but this is a biocyte facility.
their storage structure.
i'll have it up in a minute.
- okay, take a look at this.
- start from the inside out.
all storage and production
of chimera is done here,
in this lab on the 42ndfloor.
hunt's target will be the chimera,
stored and manufactured
at biocyte on the 42nd floor.
if you look at hunt's
operational history, and i have,
he invariably favors
misdirection over confrontation.
he'll never break into biocyte from
the bottom where security is heaviest.
no garage entrances.

on rotating patrol.

show me the atrium.

of the building.

ends in a glass floor which doubles
as part of the lab ceiling.
uh- uh. the atrium roof
closes at sundown.
and if the louvers are up for
more than 40seconds at night,
the civil emergency alarms
are tripped.
those, even i can't stop.
ethan, we have
a total of 40 seconds...
to get you in
and the cables out.
no, hunt will prefer to enter
biocyte somewhere from the top...
where security is minimal.
he'll undoubtedly engage
in some aerobatic insanity...
before he'll risk harming a hair
on a security guard's head.
- check- check. got copy?
- you're five- by- five.

and the rotating guards
make the building vulnerable...
to our break- in from below.
<font color="#808080">luther on earpiece :</font>
ethan, the generator's about to go active.
just a friendly reminder. we'll be
out of contact for eight minutes.
<font color="#808080">ambrose :</font>i'm betting
hunt will destroy chimera...
rather than attempt
to preserve any part of it.
he'll have to do it
in two places.
first, the incubation room
where the growth vials are kept.
and finally,
in the inoculation chamber...
holding the last remaining chimera
virus in three injection guns.
he won't be allowed to destroy
the virus in those guns.

you know, that was the hardest part
of having to portray you- -
grinning like an idiot
every 15 minutes.
i would've thought the hardest part was
curbing that pressing need of yours...
to get your gun off.
you were in such a hurry
to knock off that 747...
you never figured out
where chimera really was.
- i knew where it was.
- oh.
then you knew the only way nekhovich
could smuggle the live virus...
is by injecting himself and using
his own bloodstream as a petri dish.
you knew that...
while you were knocking him off,
destroying the very thing
you came for.
stop!
put a sock in it!
hit that bloody gun, and you'll
spray the virus all over the place!
there it is, guys.

sean, she doesn't belong here.
let her go.
she wouldn't be here...
if it wasn't for you, hunt.
from this moment, you are
responsible for what happens to her.
and if you're looking out
for her well- being,
i suggest you advise her to pick up
the injection gun and bring it to me.

you can't get us both
out of here, can you?
i'm infected with chimera.
you know you don't have a choice.
just do it.
do it now!
we've got 19 hours and 58 minutes!
i'll get bellerophon

how much time does she have left?
not long. but whatever happens,
nyah will take care of nyah.
- what do you mean?
- unless we dose her with bellerophon,
nyah will kill herself.
so first things first.

away from going through the roof.

- where?
- downtown sydney, for a start.
you create the supply, mr. mccloy.
we've just created the demand.
three million people in sydney...
and 17 million people in australia...
are going to need bellerophon
within the next few days,
not to mention
the rest of the world.
now, this is how
it's going to work.
- wallis, the shares outstanding are?
- 93.4 million.
which means, mr. mccloy, we need to
get our hands on 480,000 options.
we'll borrow your 30 million
to buy those options.
your stock has never sold
above $31 a share.
when your stock goes north of 200 which...

to bring back a living sample
of the chimera virus.
i'd be very interested to know how,

by fire.
it's the best way, really.
oh. well, mr. hunt,
as for miss hall,
in light of her efforts,
her criminal record

wiped out.
i'm assuming you approve.
i do.
yeah. where is she now, by the way?
any idea?
i don't know.

<font color="#808080">swan beck :</font>
so, what are your plans?
<font color="#808080">ethan :</font>i don't know.
uh, some sort of vacation.
i'll let you know where i'm going.
<font color="#808080">swan beck :</font>
you don't have to do that.
it wouldn't be a vacation
if you did.
let's get lost.
