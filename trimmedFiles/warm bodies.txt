<i>what am i doing</i>
<i>with my life?</i>
<i>i'm so pale.</i>
<i>i should get out more.</i>
<i>i should eat better.</i>
<i>my posture is terrible.</i>
<i>i should stand up straighter.</i>
<i>people would respect me</i>
<i>if i stood up straighter.</i>
<i>what's wrong with me?</i>
<i>i just want to connect.</i>
<i>why can't i connect</i>
<i>with people?</i>
<i>oh, right.</i>
<i>it's because i'm dead.</i>
<i>i shouldn't be</i>
<i>so hard on myself.</i>
<i>i mean, we're all dead.</i>
<i>this girl is dead.</i>
<i>that guy's dead.</i>
<i>that guy in the corner</i>
<i>is definitely dead.</i>
<i>jesus, these guys look awful.</i>
<i>i wish i could</i>
<i>introduce myself,</i>
<i>but i don't remember</i>
<i>my name anymore.</i>
<i>i mean, i think</i>
<i>it started with an "r,"</i>
<i>but that's all i have left.</i>
<i>i can't remember my name,</i>
<i>or my parents, or my job.</i>
<i>although my hoodie would</i>
<i>suggest i was unemployed.</i>
<i>sometimes i look</i>
<i>at the others</i>
<i>and try to imagine</i>
<i>what they were.</i>
<i>you were a janitor.</i>
<i>you were the rich son</i>
<i>of a corporate ceo.</i>
<i>you were</i>
<i>a personal trainer.</i>
<i>and now you're a corpse.</i>
<i>i have a hard time</i>
<i>piecing together</i>
<i>how this whole</i>
<i>apocalypse thing happened.</i>
<i>could have been</i>
<i>chemical warfare</i>
<i>or an airborne virus,</i>
<i>or a radioactive</i>
<i>outbreak monkey.</i>
<i>but it doesn't really matter.</i>
<i>this is what we are now.</i>
<i>this is a typical day</i>
<i>for me.</i>
<i>i shuffle around,</i>
<i>occasionally</i>
<i>bumping into people,</i>
<i>unable to apologize</i>
<i>or say much of anything.</i>
<i>it must have been</i>
<i>so much better before,</i>
<i>when everyone could</i>
<i>express themselves,</i>
<i>and communicate</i>
<i>their feelings</i>
<i>and just enjoy</i>
<i>each other's company.</i>
<i>a lot of us have</i>
<i>made our home here</i>
<i>at this airport.</i>
<i>i don't know why.</i>
<i>people wait at airports,</i>
<i>i guess,</i>
<i>but i'm not sure</i>
<i>what we're all waiting for.</i>
<i>oh, man. they call</i>
<i>these guys boneys.</i>
<i>they don't bother us much.</i>
<i>but they'll eat anything</i>
<i>with a heartbeat.</i>
<i>i mean, i will too,</i>
<i>but at least</i>
<i>i'm conflicted about it.</i>
<i>we all become them some day.</i>
<i>at some point</i>
<i>you just give up, i guess.</i>
<i>you lose all hope.</i>
<i>after that, there's</i>
<i>no turning back.</i>
<i>oh, man, gross...</i>
<i>stop. stop,</i>
<i>don't pick at it!</i>
<i>you're making it worse!</i>
<i>oh, this is what</i>
<i>i have to look forward to.</i>
<i>it's kind of a bummer.</i>
<i>i don't want to be this way.</i>
<i>i'm lonely. i'm lost.</i>
<i>i mean, i'm literally lost.</i>
<i>i've never been in this part</i>
<i>of the airport before.</i>
<i>wonder if these guys</i>
<i>are lost, too.</i>
<i>wandering around,</i>
<i>but never getting anywhere.</i>
<i>do they feel trapped?</i>
<i>do they want more than this?</i>
<i>am i the only one?</i>
<i>this is my best friend.</i>
<i>by best friend,</i>
<i>i mean we occasionally grunt</i>
<i>and stare awkwardly</i>
<i>at each other.</i>
<i>we even have</i>
<i>almost-conversations</i>
<i>sometimes.</i>
<i>days pass this way.</i>
<i>but sometimes we even find</i>
<i>actual words. words like.</i>
hungry.
<i>and...</i>
city.
uh.
<i>even though</i>
<i>we can't communicate,</i>
<i>we do share</i>
<i>a similar taste in food.</i>
<i>traveling in packs</i>
<i>just kind of makes sense,</i>
<i>especially when everyone</i>
<i>and their grandmother</i>
<i>is trying to shoot you</i>
<i>in the head all the time.</i>
<i>god, we move slow.</i>
<i>this could take a while.</i>
<i>hello, and thank you</i>
<i>for your service today.</i>
<i>in the eight years since this</i>
<i>plague destroyed our world.</i>
you think we're getting
this stuff for the cure?
<i>...since we erected</i>
<i>this wall...</i>
no one believes in a cure
anymore, jules.
<i>...we have counted on</i>
<i>young volunteers like you</i>
<i>to gather resources</i>
<i>from beyond the wall.</i>
<i>but first,</i>
<i>a word of caution.</i>
<i>corpses look human,</i>
<i>they are not.</i>
<i>they do not think.</i>
<i>they do not bleed.</i>
<i>whether they were your mother</i>
<i>or your best friend,</i>
<i>they are beyond your help.</i>
<i>they are uncaring, unfeeling,</i>
<i>incapable of remorse.</i>
sound like anyone
you know, dad?
<i>just picture them as this.</i>
<i>as sons and daughters of</i>
<i>possibly the sole remaining</i>
<i>human settlement on earth,</i>
<i>you are a critical part</i>
<i>of what stands between us</i>
<i>and extinction.</i>
<i>therefore</i>
<i>you have an obligation</i>
<i>to return to us safely.</i>
<i>and if you remember</i>
<i>your training, you will.</i>
<i>good luck, godspeed,</i>
<i>and god bless america.</i>
usa! usa!
let's go.
sweet.
hey, berg, you gonna
help us out or what?
no dice.
almost at level five.
did you hear that?
i did. we should bail.
oh, hey,
we can't just bail.
we have orders.
do you have any idea
how much medicine
the city goes
through a month?
we need pharmacy salvage
to survive.
we can't just
abandon our...
you sound just like my dad.
thank you.
yeah, it wasn't
a compliment.
oh, here, guys.
take some prozac.
maybe that will
cheer you up.
i told you
i heard something.
per, let's bail.
perry?
we have orders, jules.
it was nothing anyway.
you're being
paranoid, tokay?
perry!
aim for their heads!
smile, mother...
<i>nice watch.</i>
<i>now, i'm not</i>
<i>proud of this.</i>
<i>in fact,</i>
<i>i'd appreciate it</i>
<i>if you might look away</i>
<i>for a moment here.</i>
<i>i don't like hurting people,</i>
<i>but this is the world now.</i>
<i>the new hunger</i>
<i>is a very powerful thing.</i>
<i>if i don't eat all of him,</i>
<i>if i spare his brain,</i>
<i>he'll rise up and become</i>
<i>a corpse like me.</i>
<i>but if i do,</i>
<i>i get his memories,</i>
<i>his thoughts,</i>
<i>his feelings.</i>
<i>i'm sorry,</i>
<i>i just can't help it.</i>
<i>the brain's</i>
<i>the best part.</i>
<i>the part that makes me</i>
<i>feel human again.</i>
you like it, perry?
<i>i don't</i>
<i>want to hurt you.</i>
<i>i just want to feel</i>
<i>what you felt.</i>
<i>to feel a little better.</i>
<i>a little less dead.</i>
perry...
i think i love you.
say something.
don't just say nothing.
no, i, um...
i think
i love you too, julie.
i miss airplanes.
my mom used to say that
it looked like
an etch a sketch up there.
i like that you remember
that kind of stuff.
if we don't, then it will
just all be gone.
you know?
yeah.
the world is so messed up.
not all of it.
cheese ball.
perry?
perry!
perry, where are you?
answer me!
julie...
j-julie...
safe.
come...
what?
<i>i don't know</i>
<i>what i'm doing.</i>
<i>what's wrong with me?</i>
<i>these other guys</i>
<i>would never bring</i>
<i>a living person home.</i>
<i>you know why?</i>
<i>because that's crazy!</i>
<i>right now, they think</i>
<i>she's just another</i>
<i>one of us.</i>
<i>a new addition</i>
<i>to the family.</i>
<i>but they would think</i>
<i>i was insane.</i>
<i>why do i have</i>
<i>to be so weird?</i>
<i>what am i doing?</i>
home...
not eat.
keep you safe.
<i>maybe i could have</i>
<i>thought this through</i>
<i>a little more.</i>
<i>but i can tell</i>
<i>when a girl</i>
<i>needs her space.</i>
<i>there's a lot of ways</i>
<i>to get to know a person.</i>
<i>eating her dead</i>
<i>boyfriend's brains</i>
<i>is one of the more</i>
<i>unorthodox methods, but...</i>
it's a special occasion...
a special occasion, sir?
it's mom's birthday.
to diane.
to mom.
yeah.
it's mom's birthday.
so, perry,
julie tells me you've been
working in agriculture.
but tell me you would
never consider
going to work construction
with your father.
you know, on the wall
we need good people.
um...
don't mind him, per.
dad's idea of saving
humanity
is to build a really
big concrete box,
put everyone in it,
and then wait at the door
with guns
until we grow
old and die.
well, julie, without the wall,
we would be eating brains now
instead of rice.
dad...
<i>this is</i>
<i>the only way</i>
<i>past the wall.</i>
<i>otherwise we get stopped.</i>
tokay...
come on. it's not that bad.
come on.
i haven't heard from him
in two days, jules.
he's on construction detail,
perry. he's working.
my dad goes weeks
without checking in.
tokay. this way.
hey.
it's gonna be tokay.
dad.
per.
whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey!
perry! come on!
<i>no wonder</i>
<i>she's so afraid of me.</i>
<i>i need</i>
<i>a different approach.</i>
<i>tokay, here we go.</i>
<i>don't be creepy.</i>
<i>don't be creepy.</i>
<i>don't be creepy.</i>
what are you doing?
please leave me alone.
why me?
why did you save me?
don't
c-cry.
safe.
keep you safe.
what are you?
i'm hungry.
just let me go!
not safe.
not safe?
uh-huh. not safe.
well, then you're just
gonna have to go
and get me some food.
because i'm starved.
please?
i'd be very grateful
for some food.
o-tokay.
god!
shit.
don't r-run.
come. s-safe.
thank you.
be dead.
tokay?
that's too m-much.
told you not s-safe.
yeah, i get that.
i really am hungry, though.
yes!
mm.
my god.
<i>oh, no. stop staring.</i>
<i>you're acting weird again.</i>
thank you.
oh, my god.
mm!
oh, man.
i can't remember
the last time
i had a beer.
i guess you can't be
all that bad, mr. zombie.
my name...
you have a name?
what is your name?
rrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
rr?
<i>this date</i>
<i>is not going well.</i>
<i>i want to die</i>
<i>all over again.</i>
rrrrrrr...
does your name
start with "r"?
um...
robert? richard?
randy?
raphael? ricardo?
why don't i just
call you "r"?
i mean,
that's a start, right?
r...
i want to go home, r.
mm-mm.
it's n-not safe.
i get that.
and look...
i know that
you saved my life.
and i'm grateful for that.
but you walked me
into this place.
so i know that you can
walk me out again.
<i>oh, no.</i>
<i>she can't leave.</i>
<i>she just got here.</i>
<i>tell her she has to wait.</i>
<i>tell her they'll notice.</i>
h-h-have to wait.
they... they'll notice.
<i>huh. not bad.</i>
how long?
f-f-few d-days.
th-they'll f-forget.
y-y-you'll be o-quay.
are there others
like you?
i mean, i've...
i've never ever heard
a corpse talk before.
i mean,
apart from the groaning.
tokay. a few days, huh?
what am i supposed
to do for a few days
around here anyway?
this is awesome!
you wanna try?
oh, god!
oh! you're a lead foot.
tokay. tokay. pick a foot.
you're using two feet.
pick one foot...
there you go. tokay...
there you go.
all right. two hands
on the wheel, buddy.
jesus, r!
this was a beautiful car!
<i>recalculating.</i>
what's with
all the vinyl?
couldn't figure out
how to work an i pod?
better s-sound.
oh, you're a purist, huh?
more
alive.
yeah. that's true.
lot more trouble, though.
there you go again.
shrugging.
stop shrugging, shrugged.
it's a very
non-committal gesture.
really?
these are really cool records.
how did you get all these?
i collect things.
yeah, i can see that.
you, my friend,
are a hoarder.
there's this awesome
record store on main
and ivy.
you would love it.
it's so cool.
was so cool.
almighty...
much better.
r? can i ask you
something?
my boyfriend,
he died back there.
will he come back?
as one of you?
that's good, i guess.
something happened to him.
a lot of things
happened to him.
but i guess there just
came a point where
he couldn't
absorb any more.
it's just, in my world,
people die all the time.
so... you know,
it's not like
i'm not sad
that he's gone.
because i am.
but i think i've been
preparing for it
for a really long time.
what are you?
<i>man, it must be nice</i>
<i>to sleep. i wish i could.</i>
<i>i wish i could dream.</i>
<i>but that's not really</i>
<i>an option for me.</i>
<i>the dead don't dream.</i>
<i>this is as close as we get.</i>
you sure
about this, son?
welcome, then.
sorry for your loss.
me, too.
give him one
and show him
how to use it.
hey, berg, you gonna
help us out or what?
i'm almost at level five.
did you hear that?
i did. we should bail.
we can't just bail.
we have orders.
you sound
just like my dad.
thank you.
yeah, it wasn't
a compliment.
i told you
i heard something.
perry!
aim for their heads.
you said a few days.
it's been a few days, r.
i have to go home.
s-stay t-together.
safe.
what?
j-julie.
living.
eat!
eat!
eat!
oh, my god!
we go.
eat.
r. look.
this way.
come with me.
what?
no!
want to help her.
who the hell asked you?
like her.
it's tokay.
i'm sure it is.
over there, the garage.
hold on.
i'm so happy
to see you right now.
you tokay?
um... r?
you drive.
good idea.
<i>the white zone</i>
<i>is for loading and unloading</i>
<i>of passengers only.</i>
jesus, i'm freezing.
i have to pull over.
this is one of
the last neighborhoods
my dad evacuated.
maybe these houses
have food.
tokay, come on.
oh, man. it's locked.
ooh, god.
oh, cool!
look what they have.
i haven't seen one of these
in forever.
cheese!
it's all right. see?
yeah.
it's important to preserve
memories, you know?
especially now that
the world is on
its way out.
everything you see,
you may be seeing
for the last time.
perry used to say that.
here. take a picture.
i'm exhausted.
the bed actually
isn't too rotten,
so i'm gonna go to sleep.
good night.
um...
r?
y-yeah?
i was...
i was thinking...
you know, you could
sleep in there if you want.
on the floor.
these houses
creep me out, so...
tokay.
do you feel it?
do you feel it?
hey,
look up this street.
holy shit.
that's my dad.
get back!
he would have
killed you.
if he saw you,
he would have just
shot you in the head,
and you'd just be gone.
these clothes
are soaking still.
i'm gonna
lay them out to dry.
oh, relax.
<i>holy shit.</i>
don't look.
tokay.
<i>holy shit!</i>
hey.
do you have
to eat people?
y-yeah.
or you'll die?
yeah.
but you didn't eat me.
you rescued me.
like, a bunch.
it must be hard
being stuck in there.
you know,
i can see you trying.
maybe that's what
people do.
you know,
we try to be better.
sometimes
we kind of suck at it.
but i look at you and
you try so much harder
than any human in my city.
you're a good person, r.
anyway.
it was me.
what was you?
oh.
i mean, i...
i guess
i kind of knew that.
y-you did?
yeah, i...
i guess i hoped
that you didn't.
i'm sorry.
julie...
i'm so s-sorry.
julie...
<i>the dead do not sleep.</i>
if you guys
could pick any job
in the world...
pretend that everything
was totally different,
what would you want to do?
nursing.
yeah?
yeah. healing people and
saving lives and...
i don't know,
finding a cure.
i like that.
i think someday
someone's gonna
figure out
this whole thing and
exhume the whole world.
exhume?
and what does that mean?
um, exhume means
to, like, revive.
it means to dig up.
as in digging up a corpse.
whatever.
what the hell
are you doing here?
are you actually
dreaming right now?
i'm not sure.
you can't dream, corpse.
dreaming is for humans.
chill out, per.
he can dream
if he wants to.
what about you, r?
what do you want to be?
i don't know.
i don't even know
what i am.
well, you can be
whatever you want.
isn't that
what they say?
we can, right?
you and me?
mm-mm.
it's not gonna happen,
lover boy.
not after you told her
you ate her ex.
shrug.
<i>so much for dreaming.</i>
<i>you can't be</i>
<i>whatever you want.</i>
<i>all i'll ever be</i>
<i>is a slow, pale,</i>
<i>hunched-over,</i>
<i>dead-eyed zombie.</i>
<i>that she'd actually</i>
<i>want to stay with me?</i>
<i>it's hopeless.</i>
<i>this is what i get</i>
<i>for wanting more.</i>
<i>i should just be happy</i>
<i>with what i had.</i>
<i>things don't change.</i>
<i>i need to accept that.</i>
<i>it's easier not to feel.</i>
<i>then i wouldn't have to</i>
<i>feel like this.</i>
<i> i've been alone</i>
<i>too many nights</i>
<i> too proud to tell you</i>
<i>when you're right</i>
<i> a little patience</i>
<i>would have helped me then</i>
<i> a lot like the break</i>
<i>has been the common stand</i>
<i> all the angels above</i>
<i>the earth i prayed</i>
<i> send this message</i>
<i>right into her head</i>
<i> there's certain things</i>
<i>in life i cannot take</i>
<i> and i will wait</i>
<i> i hope you know i care</i>
<i> so cold</i>
<i>i know you can't believe it</i>
<i> sometimes</i>
<i>you gotta face the feeling</i>
<i> when you don't care</i>
<i>if you get up again</i>
<i> there's a thousand this</i>
<i>i will not understand</i>
<i> i hope you know i care</i>
<i> now you're dealing with</i>
<i>the hell i put you through</i>
<i> if i had my way i would be</i>
<i>right there next to you</i>
<i> there's certain things</i>
<i>in life you cannot change</i>
<i> there's certain things</i>
identify yourself!
it's just me, kevin.
it's tokay. i'm fine.
just stop right there.
it's tokay.
i'm not infected.
i said stop, julie!
tokay. fine. fine.
let me check you out.
is she tokay?
clear, sir.
hi, dad.
i sent a half a dozen units
out looking for you.
nora said
you were taken into...
yeah, i was.
but i escaped.
i was holed up in a house
in the suburbs
and then i found a car,
so i came here.
julie, are you sure
nothing bit you?
do i look infected
to you, dad?
we have to be safe.
yeah, i know. i know.
i'm fine, though.
i promise.
i thought i lost you.
well, you didn't, dad.
i'm here.
welcome home.
yeah. good to be back.
<i>so i'm just gonna go home.</i>
<i>i'm gonna blend in.</i>
<i>i'm gonna stop</i>
<i>thinking so much.</i>
<i>i'm gonna</i>
<i>forget about her,</i>
<i>just like i forgot</i>
<i>about everything else.</i>
<i>i'm gonna...</i>
<i>oh, shit, am i cold?</i>
<i>is that what this is?</i>
<i>corpses don't get cold.</i>
yo!
what are you
doing here?
boneys.
they chased me out.
came to find you.
where is she?
went home.
you tokay?
no.
bitches, man.
boneys looking for you.
and her.
you started something.
i saw
pictures
last night.
memories.
my mom...
summertime.
cream
of wheat.
a girl.
a dream?
a dream.
we are changing, i think.
we are.
we are.
i-i have to tell her.
w-will you help?
h-help?
ex-hume?
e-exhume.
they said
"fuck, yeah!"
wait here.
be careful. tokay?
so i'll wait here.
it's not that bad.
come on.
<i>julie and i were</i>
<i>giving the others hope.</i>
<i>and it was</i>
<i>spreading fast.</i>
<i>i guess the boneys</i>
<i>didn't like that.</i>
<i>that must be why</i>
<i>they're looking for us.</i>
<i>i have to tell julie.</i>
<i>l have to explain what's happening before it's too late.</i>
<i>i have to...</i>
<i>oh, no. oh, no.</i>
<i>please, go!</i>
<i>go with your friends!</i>
<i>shoo! leave me!</i>
<i>that's it! tokay.</i>
no, i'm serious, nora.
i mean, "corpse" is just...
it's just a stupid name
that we came up with
for a state of being
that we don't understand.
yeah.
oh, my god!
what is wrong with me?
tokay.
i've got to
tell you something.
this is kind of weird.
please do not
freak out.
no.
but i actually miss him.
you... you miss him?
i know, it's so stupid.
like you're
attracted to him?
no, i don't...
like he could be
your boyfriend?
your zombie boyfriend?
i mean, i know it's really
hard to meet guys right now
with the apocalypse
and stuff, trust me.
and look, i know
that you miss perry.
tokay? but, julie,
this is weird.
like, i wish the internet
was still working
so i could just look up
whatever it is
that's wrong with you.
shut up.
all right.
tokay. i'm getting
ready for bed.
hey.
i'm glad you're back.
yeah.
have sweet dreams
about your zombie.
all right.
julie.
julie!
oh, my god.
r!
what are you doing here?
came to see you.
r...
you can't just do that.
it's dangerous.
grigio, shut up!
i'm trying to sleep!
uh, sorry!
jesus, r, are you crazy?
the people here,
they're not like me.
if they see you,
you'll get killed.
do you understand that?
yes.
are you
talking to yourself?
no!
tokay, seriously,
what is going on
out here, julie?
oh, my god!
is that him?
yeah.
'sup?
i'm sorry.
i know.
i'm sorry, too.
i actually missed you.
me, too.
it's funny.
you feel warmer
than i remember.
that's the patrol.
come on, we better
get you inside.
come on.
you're lucky my dad
got pulled into
some emergency thing.
you're safe here
tonight, r.
after that i don't know
what we're gonna do.
how did you die?
i don't remember.
how old are you?
because you could be
twenty-something,
but you could also
be a teenager.
you have one
of those faces.
oh, my god.
and i can't even smell...
you don't smell...
he doesn't smell rotten.
i don't...
amazing.
nora, he didn't come here
for an interview. stop.
why did you come here, r?
to show everyone...
show them what?
that we can change.
r, no one here is
ever gonna buy that.
not that we could
get you even close
enough to tell them.
as soon as they saw you,
they would blow
your head to bits.
wait a minute.
did you say "we"?
lots of us changing.
dreaming.
that's kind of
a big deal.
we have to move fast.
what do you mean?
boneys chasing me.
they're chasing us.
tokay, we have
to go to my dad.
no, that is
a very bad idea.
no, nora, he was
a reasonable guy once.
oh, no,
i think you're confused.
it was your mom that
was the reasonable one.
it was your dad
that grounded you
for a year
for stealing
peach schnapps.
are you serious?
it's your dad
that likes to shoot
corpses in the head.
well, what other choice
do we have, nora?
still, we'd have to
get him through the city.
someone would
definitely see you.
there isn't much time.
we could fix him up.
what?
i have some makeup
that i was saving
for a special occasion
that obviously
isn't gonna happen.
yeah. yeah, we could.
we could put on
a little bit of
foundation,
maybe a little blush.
probably a lot of blush.
no way.
yeah, way.
would you change
the song, please?
what? it's funny.
no, it's not.
fine.
there we go.
oh, yeah.
hold up...
you look hot!
what?
nothing.
it's just, you look nice.
i don't know
how my dad's gonna be.
he gets kind of crazy.
this might not work.
hey.
no matter what,
we stay together.
we're changing everything.
i know.
stay together. promise.
i promise.
come on.
hey, it's game time.
all right, let's do this.
excuse me.
where are you
guys headed?
to see my dad, kevin.
miss grigio,
i can't let you guys in.
we're on high alert
around here.
why? what's going on?
it's classified.
all right, well,
we have our own
classified business,
so come on.
hey.
hey.
<i>say something human.</i>
<i>say something human.</i>
how are you?
<i>nailed it.</i>
over here. he's fine.
tokay, you guys wait here.
what are you doing here?
what is going on?
what is all this?
i'm not sure,
but it's not good.
we've been
getting reports
there are sizable packs
of skeletons and corpses
coming toward us.
we don't know why,
but if they're here
to attack,
there's nothing
we can do about it.
too many of them,
too few of us.
so i want you to get home,
lock down the house.
i have the gun there,
the ruger sr...
this? yeah, tokay.
i need to talk to you.
julie, not now.
dad, it's important.
this is gonna sound
really crazy, but
i think the dead
are coming back to life.
that does sound crazy.
they're changing, dad.
they're...
i don't know.
they're somehow
curing themselves.
you think they're curing
themselves? how is that?
i saw it.
it is really happening.
no. you know what is
happening, julie?
what's happening
is every day
there are more of them
and less of us.
they are not
curing themselves.
we're their food source.
they are not becoming vegan.
tokay? they don't eat broccoli.
they eat brains,
your mother's and
your boyfriend's included.
tokay? so i want you
to wake up!
i'll explain.
tokay?
what do you mean,
"you'll explain"?
explain what?
i got this.
get yourself home.
barricade yourself
in the shelter.
there is enough stuff there
that you can open up...
uh... hi.
who are you?
i didn't ask you.
i asked him.
who are you?
you're a corpse?
he saved my life.
he took care of me.
i triggered
something in him
and that must have sparked
something in all of them...
no...
now it's triggered
something in me.
dad! no! dad!
we want to help.
please, they don't
want to attack us.
they want to help.
we're...
we're getting better.
no. things don't get better.
things get worse.
people get bit,
then they get infected,
then i shoot them
in the head.
no, dad...
that's what happened
to your mother, and that's
what's gonna happen to him.
i'm really sorry,
mr. grigio.
go. get out of here
and be safe,
no matter what. tokay?
julie...
i have to go.
you're not
gonna shoot me.
yes. yeah, i will.
totally.
tokay. that could
have gone better.
i need to warn
my friends.
where?
the stadium...
shit! come on!
get on the subway!
whoa.
excuse me.
excuse me. sorry.
coming through.
r.
julie.
hi.
ready for a fight.
yeah, i can see that.
s-soldiers coming.
boneys closing in.
they're here now.
keep them out.
we will.
run.
this way, come on!
<i>sir, your daughter</i>
<i>is with the corpse.</i>
<i>i've got eyes on them.</i>
thank you.
who the hell
do we shoot?
this asshole.
hi.
hey. hi. hi.
<i>we see corpses</i>
<i>fighting skeletons, sir.</i>
<i>copy that.</i>
<i>we're seeing that</i>
<i>over here, too.</i>
sorry, can you
repeat that?
<i>copy that.</i>
<i>we're seeing</i>
<i>corpses fighting</i>
<i>skeletons, sir.</i>
shit!
it's over.
no. keep you safe.
it will be tokay.
r?
r!
r, please?
you tokay?
yeah.
yeah?
whoa.
next one's the head.
move away from him, julie.
no!
julie, move now.
dad, you have
to listen to me.
i know we lost everybody.
i know you lost mom.
but you and me,
we are still here.
we can fix all this.
we can start over.
they need our help.
please, dad!
look at him.
he's different.
he's...
bleeding.
he's bleeding, dad.
corpses don't bleed!
oh, god.
you're alive. he's alive!
you're alive.
does it hurt?
yeah.
yeah?
sir?
this is colonel grigio.
the situation has changed.
let's get you two
the hell out of here.
are you still bleeding?
yes.
good.
sorry.
<i>on the one hand,</i>
<i>getting shot</i>
<i>in the chest hurt.</i>
<i>like, a lot.</i>
<i>but on the other,</i>
<i>it felt good to bleed,</i>
<i>to feel pain.</i>
<i>to feel love.</i>
<i>i wish i could say</i>
<i>we cured the boneys</i>
<i>with love,</i>
<i>but really we just</i>
<i>straight up killed them .</i>
<i>it sounds</i>
<i>kind of messed up,</i>
<i>but no one felt</i>
<i>too bad about it.</i>
<i>they were too far gone</i>
<i>to change.</i>
<i>it was actually</i>
<i>a really good</i>
<i>bonding experience</i>
<i>for us and the humans.</i>
<i>once we joined forces,</i>
<i>they didn't stand a chance.</i>
<i>the ones we didn't kill</i>
<i>just wasted away.</i>
<i>and the rest of us?</i>
<i>well, we kind of learned</i>
<i>how to live again.</i>
<i>for a while,</i>
<i>it seemed like</i>
<i>a lot of us forgot</i>
<i>what that meant.</i>
<i>the humans</i>
<i>began to accept us,</i>
<i>connect with us,</i>
<i>teach us.</i>
<i>this was the key</i>
<i>to the cure.</i>
<i>it was scary at first, but</i>
<i>every great thing starts out</i>
<i>a little scary, doesn't it?</i>
<i>this is how it happened.</i>
<i>this is how the world was</i>
<i>exhumed.</i>
you need some help?
yeah.
i have, uh,
zombie fingers.
thank you.
here.
oh, it's tokay.
i don't mind the rain.
i insist.
i'm...
mar-marcus.
emily.
you're...
you're very pretty.
thank you, marcus.
now you're supposed
to say i'm pretty, too.
r?
yeah?
do you remember
your name yet?
no.
well, you know,
you could just
give yourself one.
just pick one.
whatever you want.
i like "r."
really?
you don't want to know
what it was?
you don't want
your old life back?
no.
i want this one.
just "r," huh?
just "r."
