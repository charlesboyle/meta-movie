enjoy the movie.
- it's beautiful, right?
- it's great.
hey.
- what's that?
- what?
- check it out.
- hey.
okay.
- hey, there's a note in it.
- get out of here.
yes, there is. it says:
- "will you mar... "
- stephanie?
it's no secret
we've been on a journey together.
an adventure.
and i've done a lot of soul searching
and i know...
this is just right.
so will you marry me?
that's so sweet. no.
sorry?
i can't.
really?
i really didn't wanna
do this right now
but you're kind of forcing my hand.
i'm thinking we've reached
the end of the line.
really?
look, griffin, i know it shouldn't
bother me that you're a zookeeper...
but it kind of does.
and when we first started dating,
i just assumed...
that you would turn into the guy
that i'd always dreamed of being with.
- but...
- not your dream guy, i got it.
you had to see this coming.
i bought a ring and rented a horse.
well, that's not my fault!
don't yell at me on the beach!
- i love...
- stop it!
do not make this harder
than it has to be. god!
you totally set me up.
little heads up.
i may have hired a mariachi band.
oh, there they are.
just ignore them.
ignore it.
thank you, sir. there you go.
good morning, barry.
come on, donald, let's move you
out of the sun. come on.
there you go, buddy. nice and shady.
- cherry.
- thanks, franky.
see you at the party tonight.
come on, shane. what are you doing?
we talked about this.
his food should always be fresh and
placed inside the door out of the sun.
you go down there all you want. i am
not getting jacked up by him again.
it's been 10 years. bernie's cool.
why do you bring
this stuff around here?
you trying to make the rest of us
look bad?
what? no, no.
i feel for him. he's all alone.
oh, he's all alone.
look, it all starts with trust.
sure.
you won't be so cocky when
he's beating you
to death with your own arm.
hey, bern.
got a little something for you.
looks like things
just got fun around here, huh?
what is this, anyway?
is this an old tire
or a gateway to adventure?
it's... it's adventure.
it's an adventure.
hey, tony.
go.
hey. how did it go with
the tire swing?
oh, that good, huh?
don't know if he's gonna come around.
- don't get discouraged.
bernie feels what you're trying to do.
all the animals do.
- you're like the hippo whisperer.
- i don't know.
hey, is that the new release cage?
yep.
- the eagle enclosure's almost done.
- i gotta tell you, it is amazing.
- great job.
- thank you.
it's getting a lot of attention.
in fact, i may be sitting on an offer
to work my magic...
at the nairobi zoo in africa.
oh, man.
wow, that's awesome. congratulations.
i'm thinking about it, but ....
it's great to be wanted.
you know how that feels.
oh, i've been in play.
there was a zoo in new hampshire
that was coming after me pretty hard.
it wasn't so much a zoo.
it was more an animal farm.
but the animals were nice. cool.
not big like here.
we didn't have the...
they had a couple badgers.
a badger and a...
they had a sick raccoon. sick.
his name was peter and he was big.
- hang in there, girl.
- whoa!
- you'll be all right.
- what happened?
- she's having trouble breathing.
- what's happening?
she's stable and she's sedated.
- i'm gonna get a trach tube.
- oh, my god. okay.
- what do we do, kate?
- don't panic, griffin.
- not breathing.
- support her neck.
on my count. one, two, and ....
she's a big girl. she's a big girl.
- griffin, you okay?
- yeah.
there's something blocking her airway.
i need a laryngoscope.
- i don't know what a laryngo...
- it's in the drawer.
okay, i got post-its,
cinnamon tic tacs...
no, no, no. it's silver,
it's curved and has a light on it.
got it.
come on. there's definitely something
in her throat.
hold her jaw open.
i'm putting my hand in.
- it's stuck.
- no, come on.
oh, god. okay.
- i guess i'm up.
- i can't...
- come on.
- okay, i'll hold.
- hold the jaw.
- come on, you can do it.
that's a feeling
i never wanna get used to.
hurry, hurry.
you can do it, you can do it.
i got it.
she's breathing.
good luck getting the deposit back
on that one.
you did it.
no, we did it.
we did it.
she's okay.
oh, god. you're okay.
this place looks amazing, griffin. no.
grif, mom and dad
would have loved this. thank you.
- kate.
- hi, dave.
that's... kate heads up
our eagle program.
- congratulations.
- that's robin.
- this is venom, he's our reptile guy.
- hey.
- how are you?
- oh, you gotta bring it in with him.
now onto the fiancée.
okay, venom, reel it in.
- okay, that feels good.
- yeah.
hey, come on.
no, you're not married yet.
congrats on your big day.
i don't know where you kids are going
for your honeymoon, but omaha...
stupid with underground fight clubs.
okay.
- we're gonna circulate.
- yeah.
all right. congrats on being hot.
i gots to gets my flows on.
all right, folks.
i'd like to bring up the guy
who is responsible...
for putting together
this little party-slash-field trip.
dave's brother, griffin.
griffin.
- are you going with floyd?
- oh, yeah.
- go get them.
- i'm getting them.
let's hear it for him.
love.
we're all here tonight
to celebrate one thing...
and that's love.
you know, finding the perfect mate...
is the most important thing
in the world.
no matter what package they come in.
i mean, you take floyd here.
now, porcupines, they...
they get a bad rap, you know?
and i'm sure you see the sharp quills
and the tough exterior.
but you know what i see?
just a great guy looking for love.
and that's what robin sees
in my brother dave.
- to the couple.
- yeah.
to you guys.
congratulations.
all right.
hi.
god, what was i... ?
sorry, i just lost my train of...
i got a train of... train.
what i'm basically saying is...
i mean, i'm not...
may not be an expert on love,
you know...
per se.
but i do know a lot about animals.
he's an indigenous...
he's a woodland creature.
did i cover burrowing?
did i go over burrow
because i don't know if i got...
i had a whole thing on burrow.
did it get hotter, 10 degrees hotter?
where did that breeze go? it is hot.
my elbows are sweating.
that's weird.
i don't know why
i'm telling you this now. oh, boy.
i had so many beautiful things...
i'm just gonna sum up.
i think sum it up,
what i wanted to say.
dave, robert, good luck.
that's really what it comes down to.
and anybody who wants to learn
more about porcupines...
i'll be off to the side over here.
yeah. food for thought,
ladies and gentlemen.
- you invited stephanie?
- sorry to jump you like that.
i didn't even know robin
was gonna invite her. i'm an idiot.
you still got a thing for her,
don't you?
so, stephanie, i saw the way
that you were looking at griffin.
is something going on?
i don't know.
i guess i feel bad about
the way things ended between us.
i might've been a little rough on him.
- a little?
okay, robin, a lot. i'll own it.
seeing him tonight and
up there in his little uniform and....
so cute.
i don't know, it just reminds me
that he has so much potential.
you deserve a great girl in your life.
but you gotta understand
how the world works.
- what's wrong with being a zookeeper?
- nothing, you're the best, okay?
it's just ....
look.
offer's still on the table
to work at the dealership.
okay? because here's you, the grass,
mine's greener.
- dave.
- no, i'm serious.
you could make
your annual salary in a month.
that is how you get a girl
like stephanie.
come on, this could be
a whole new life for you.
think about it.
yeah.
floyd, right?
i hope my being here
doesn't make you uncomfortable.
i'm not uncomfortable. so comfortable.
oh, my god. oh, my god.
no, it's fine, it's fine. i got it.
oh, god, it's barbed.
okay, so, hey, how you doing?
still in design school?
- no, no, i've been out for a while.
- okay.
- i'm a buyer for saks now.
- oh, that's good.
i see you've been busy.
lead zookeeper.
yes, yeah.
you know, i got the bump last year.
they don't usually do that until you
have been working here like 10 years.
i'm only been here eight.
it's basically like getting a black
belt after only a month of karate.
or mastering a ....
let's see ....
that's all i can think of right now.
- just karate, go with that.
- yeah.
so it's good.
yeah.
that's good.
oh, griffin, you're bleeding.
- no, no.
- yes, yes, you are.
come here.
let me get it, come...
i'm not gonna bite.
there.
there you go. now you're all better.
anyway, robin was talking about...
wanting to see the animals tomorrow...
and were wondering what are the
odds of getting a private tour?
not good. not good at all.
there's a sign-up sheet,
a pretty elaborate waiver.
and you'd have to go
through the main office,
which is closed. they close at 4.
- yeah, doesn't sound good.
- it's not.
okay, so we're on our own.
- well, it was really nice to see you.
- okay.
you know?
bye, floyd.
bye, griffin.
dave's right.
i gotta get out of this zoo.
- closing up shop again, grif?
- yeah, just had to clean up.
meeting.
let's do this. come on.
what? oh, nothing.
i certainly wasn't cleaning
my basement.
okay. here we go.
if this is another eating
intervention, i'm not hearing it.
this is my ideal weight. ask the vet.
come on. pop the latch.
yeah, let's go. we want a good seat.
- what do you think this is about?
- what am i? psychic?
we got the call at the same time.
take it down a peg,
i was just asking question.
bernie.
hey, we having a meeting.
you wanna come?
no, you don't want to come.
forget i don't know why i asked.
come on, everybody. let's go.
we're gonna have a meeting.
i'm excited about this.
- i wonder.
- what's going on?
all right. i got a very busy schedule.
this better be good.
you sleep 20 hours a day, joe.
i think you'll live.
okay, things i didn't want
the group to know.
look, we got a problem.
remember that chick that
broke griffin's heart 5 years ago?
well, she is back.
- what?
- what, stephanie's back?
this is not good.
griffin's thinking of quitting
the zoo. we can't let that happen.
he can't leave.
he's the best zookeeper we ever had.
he keeps my hay fresh and he rubs
lotion on me when i get dry skin.
he makes papier-maché antelopes
for me to attack. and inside? muffins.
oh, i like muffins.
can i get a "hey now"?
plus, he's the only human
who recognizes me as an equal.
yeah, in your dreams.
thumbs, baby.
it's all about the thumbs.
- what do you call this?
- that's a paw.
you can't grab a coffee mug with that.
you can't wear mittens. it's useless.
i'm so blessed.
sorry. one more look.
griffin saved my life.
all right, you know what. i made my
decision. we're not helping griffin.
really? you know, because
i remember a time
when you needed some
help with females.
namely me. remember, you were shy.
you sent your buddy over
to test the waters to make sure.
and then you would, like,
follow me around.
i'd look at you,
you'd look away embarrassed.
okay. we're helping griffin.
- now, how do you propose we do it?
- animals are experts on mating.
we tell him point blank
how to get her back.
no.
nobody's talking to griffin.
you know the code.
we don't ever talk to humans.
you don't break the code, idiot.
besides,
griffin's got no shot at this girl.
that is exactly why you're single,
bruce. you have no sense of romance.
herbivore.
maybe it's possible to help griffin
without talking to him.
the girl's gonna be here tomorrow
and she's interested.
and how do you know that?
she said, and i quote,
"griffin has potential." potential.
all we have to do is make him
look like a hero in front of her.
then zip-zang, griffin gets
the girl, stays at the zoo...
everybody wins.
awesome. we got a plan.
hey, what's this now?
wait. you're not a zoo animal.
excuse me. am i standing in the zoo?
then i'm a zoo animal.
don't get mad at us because no kid
says, "mommy, i wanna see a crow."
okay, that's the captivity talking.
enough. you've all made your point,
we'll help griffin.
but no one breaks the code.
- understood?
- no breaking the code.
okay, we're helping a human.
this is big.
come on, barry.
you started your diet today.
- he's not even chewing.
- hey man! take a breath.
what, i'm stress-eating.
stop looking at me!
much better than the tire we had.
sorry about that, by the way.
you're gonna enjoy this a lot more.
i don't know. i made it, i drilled it
and i put a little ball in there.
get that baby spinning,
have it land in a circle.
what? winner, winner, chicken dinner.
i think you'll like it.
there. there you go.
i'm not sure, kind of like
a disco ball though. look at that.
party at bernie's. it's fun.
it's gonna be good.
it sucks being alone here, buddy.
i know.
all right.
okay.
see you tomorrow, bern.
i don't know.
she just intimidates me, you know?
but you know me.
i don't like to talk about it.
hey, griffin.
- hey, grif.
- hey.
we were gonna go see the rhinos...
and we were wondering
if you could show us the way.
you know what? i can't right now.
i'm feeding the giraffe.
she's eating carrots.
okay.
here they come.
- see the thumb?
- yeah, yeah, i see it.
all right! time to make griffin
look like a hero.
here we go. get it together.
all right, here you go.
anybody looking? no.
- oh, my god.
- joe.
joe, over here.
please. this way.
get them out of there,
i'll distract him.
got it.
joe.
oh, crap.
get in.
oh, god.
joe.
joe? joe.
joe.
joe.
joe.
joe.
what the hell is wrong with you?
oh, i mean:
wait a sec.
griffin, i know this is weird.
- griffin.
- lion secure, going home.
haven 't you learned anything
from being under my tutelage?
no. no.
mommy, look, it's going to eat.
come on.
- yeah, it's on but, like, on reverse.
- yeah, you should definitely go.
he... ?
he didn't... ?
wasn't saying anything, did he?
what's going on?
- he's a good one, yeah.
- how much do they weigh?
what's up?
- good night, griffin.
- good night, manny. heading home?
if by "home"
you mean uncle bosoms...
i'll be there in the back,
purple couch.
okay.
all right.
i know barry, you had your dinner...
but this is just a little reward
for what i like to call
a winning attitude.
you care to comment on that?
yeah, i didn't think so. okay.
have a good one.
you wanna talk? let's talk.
you remember nothing.
i totally think this is working.
relax. calm down, calm down.
breathe. breathe.
take it easy. take it easy.
he's freaking out.
look at him, look at him.
we're sitting in a circle staring at
him. what do you think i'm looking at?
- you can talk.
- yeah, we can talk.
i can sing pretty good.
and i can teach you how to give
yourself a bath with your nose.
how'd you get out of your enclosures?
- you don't wanna know.
- actually, i do.
- okay, but i don't wanna tell you.
how long have you been able to talk?
let's see. today's tuesday, so always.
always.
- then why haven't you?
- humans can't handle it.
any time we talk to humans,
it always ends badly.
except for parrots.
somehow they get away with it.
"i be parrot.
happy birthday."
why did you talk to me?
look! you saved my mate so we tried
to help you connect with yours.
but you blew it.
i appreciate it, but you know what?
i had a really bad experience
and i don't like to talk about it.
"don't like to talk about it."
that's crazy.
we've been hearing about
that breakup on the beach every day...
for the last five years.
okay, i might have mentioned it before
i knew you could understand me.
come on, man, we heard her talking.
she wants you.
so what if you don't have my great
complexion or my thick, wavy hair?
i would tell you this.
you have nice calves.
great calves.
of course i don't have calves.
i basically
have columns with toenails.
so.. i don't know, you think i should
maybe just ask her out?
okay. all right, now,
slow it down, hot shot.
you ask stephanie out,
it's gonna end the same way.
you haven't changed, you don't know
how to trust your instincts.
you listen to us
and we turn you into an alpha male.
i don't know.
personally, i don't think
he's got the size to be enough.
size has nothing to do with it.
i think we both know who
the alpha is between us.
you see right there.
you're giving me attitude.
that's why i do stuff
to your water bowl.
- that was you?
- yeah.
you said it was vitamin drops.
- surprise.
- oh, that's it.
- bring it, come on.
- it's been brought.
oh, boy, here we go again.
it's like watching a fight
between two beanbag chairs.
- i am tired. i'm back in.
- me too.
you're a good man, griffin.
you just need a little help.
yeah. who better than us to help you?
- come on, you honeypot.
- bring it, big boy.
what have i got to lose?
- that's not instilling confidence.
- sorry.
two more licks.
is it on, is it on, is it on? yeah.
hey.
thought we'd mix things up
a little today.
got some organic jambalaya.
you know...
if you ever ....
you want anything, i...
you could always ask me.
hey, how's the...?
how's that ball working out for you?
lot of fun with the...
any disco...
parties'?
all right.
just leave it by the door.
come on.
move. come on, stupid bears.
do something.
what is he doing?
hey. don't do that.
no, no, no. hey.
can we get that?
okay. now, no sudden movements.
i want you to get to your feet. okay,
we're gonna slowly walk to the door.
come on.
they're not gonna hurt you. good.
okay, we're fine, here. here we go.
- he backed you down.
- i didn't see you do anything.
hey, thanks, guys.
i appreciate you showing
some restraint there.
look, any other day,
that kid would've been lunch.
but you showed confidences, and that's
what you're not doing with the girl.
see, when i take down a female, i...
- take down a female, you?
- you don't know me my whole life.
i did three years in vancouver
for your information.
so, you said you got a
chick in canada?
yeah, i was dating a kodiak model.
- kodiak model?
- she's technically a model.
she was on a tobacco can,
she was born with an extra claw.
and let me tell you,
she knew how to use it.
canadian bears are wild.
very wild.
she's wild in your dreams.
you don't know squat, jerome.
were you there, huh?
i didn't think so.
and what's with the "jerome"?
anyway, you need to unlock
your inner bear.
the only way that's gonna happen
is to do as we say.
- and that's how you get your girl.
- we get it.
all right, let's start with your walk.
- my... come on, my walk is fine.
- fine? it's a hot, stinking pile.
this time he's got a point. come on.
- show us your stuff.
- yup.
my... this is stupid.
- my walk?
- wipe that goofy look off your face.
you're a predator. act like it.
get those paws up. that's what we do.
what was that?
- no, no, no.
- this guy's untrainable.
i really think we're wasting
our time here.
give me one more shot.
come on, get your paw up.
yeah, up. come on, reach.
- this is ridiculous.
- we know what we're doing.
- trust it.
- get your paws up.
there you go.
that's what we're talking about.
let's see some movement.
swing your paws
like you're swatting salmon.
- good.
- i don't know, man.
give us a snort. good old bear snort.
not with your nose, with your mouth.
get your lips into it.
- there you go.
- yeah.
- now lead with your pudding cup.
- my pudding cup?
yeah, your pudding cup, man.
get it out front. remove the mystery.
that's good like that.
who... '? how would this ever help me?
- yeah! show them the goods.
- this just feels weird.
that's it, looks good. come on.
add a roar.
the roar.
put some oomph into it.
roar.
- fine.
- bend those knees.
- get low.
- yeah.
- shake that money-maker.
- swing those arms.
- here's a predator.
- dig a hole.
- dig a big old bear hole.
- dig it.
- get dirty.
- stop digging.
- no, keep digging.
- keep digging.
- what, are you too good to dig?
- that's it.
- through the wickets.
- that's good.
kick up those woodchips.
look at him, a natural.
scratch your back.
scratch it on the tree.
- yeah, he's a bear.
- yeah, he's a bear, baby.
- you're the bear.
- you're a big bear.
stop it.
hi, kids.
carry them all?
we'll look at the giraffe now.
i appreciate the grub.
no problem.
i popped it myself, so enjoy.
now, i would have left it in longer.
i like mine burnt a bit.
but i wasn't sure
how you weighed in on that.
this is fine.
hey, shane.
i was supposed to tell you there's
a staff meeting tomorrow at 10.
okay, cool. thanks.
who are you talking to?
no, you know what it is?
i'm in a one-act play...
and i was rehearsing.
i know both parts because
i'm understudying the other guy.
and something.
what's the play about?
steam ships.
i wouldn't do it around him.
that's when they get you, you see?
when you're not focused.
i didn't do it, you know.
- i'm sorry?
- i didn't attack him.
oh, yeah, he says you did though.
he's a liar, okay?
he never treats us with any respect.
to get us to move,
he prods us with a long stick...
with a nail in the end of it.
one day, i guess i wasn't
walking fast as he wanted me to...
so he swung the stick at me, but i
caught it, and he slipped and fell.
he told everyone i attacked him.
wow, i never knew any of that.
and my only mistake was
assuming he would tell the truth.
i guess that's what humans do.
they lie.
not all humans, bernie.
look, now, maybe you got a raw deal...
but sometimes we need
to put the past behind us...
and look towards the future, you know?
i guess sometimes
we all get stuck living in the past.
yeah.
look, is there anything else
i can do for you?
can you get me my view back?
you know, it's not my call.
i miss it, you know? seeing the world.
i used to be able
to climb high enough...
that i could just catch a glimpse
of a few buildings.
now all i see is cement.
i wish i could help you, bernie,
but... i mean, that enclosure's gone.
it's a...
it's where the snack bar is now.
all right.
do you mind if i ask you a question?
anything.
is t.g.i. friday's
as incredible as it looks?
it's pretty good.
all right! your girl's gonna be at
the party. here's how we get her.
first, answer me this, what do you
think attracts a female to a male?
looks, success...
i'm gonna stop you right there.
- it's pee-pee.
- sorry?
pee-pee. smell, scent,
chemistry, pheromones.
which is why you have to learn
to protect your territory.
- turn everything into a home game.
- there's gotta be another way.
there's not.
now, don't be stingy with the magic.
watch and learn.
notice the full extension
of my lift leg.
- the proud, soaring arc of my stream.
- yeah.
you see how i raised the bar
from the last pee mark.
and <i>voilé.</i>
you're up, sunshine.
you know,
i really don't feel like doing this.
the zoo is closed. you're fine.
all right.
not there. that's my spot.
hey, don't give me attitude.
this will help you
at the rehearsal dinner tonight.
right here. fine.
all right, unzip and make it rain.
okay, you gotta look away.
such a delicate flower.
shut it down. shut it down.
- kate's coming.
- what?
- i can't_
- snap it.
be a man. snap it.
hey griffin, rebecca and i are going..
- hey.
hey.
it's gonna be very hard to unsee that.
i'm sorry about that, i...
you know what happened...
the wolf got stung
by one of venom's scorpions.
and i was taking him
to the infirmary...
and then he started limping bad.
oh, and the urine
will neutralize the poison.
exactly, exactly, yes, yes.
and that's why i did it.
i was just peeing on him,
for his health.
okay, when you finish, i'll give him
an antihistamine just to be safe.
- sounds good.
- all right, go ahead.
go ahead. soak it.
make sure you get the whole area.
sorry.
i have to.
lather, rinse, repeat.
excuse me, sir.
you do know that we have
a fully functioning
restroom not 20 feet from here.
oh, look at that... you do, good,
that sounds good. yeah, that's nice.
- have a good evening.
- you too.
- hey, how's it going?
- good.
i've set up my territory, i'm about
to show stephanie my pudding cup.
what?
- yeah, thank you.
- pretty great party, huh?
yeah, dave goes all out.
he really does.
listen, stephanie, i was thinking...
weddings can be weird
if you're alone and you...
oh, god.
no, no, don't. no, it's not you.
it's, it's...
oh, it's my ex, i broke up with him,
but he showed up here anyway.
sweetness. funny story.
so i go to the fridge the other day
to replenish the old electrolytes...
after some cross-training,
and there...
taped to the door, right next to the
picture of that kayak i'm getting...
was the invitation to this wedding
that you wanted me to go to.
so here i be.
no, no, no.
gale, this is an old friend of mine.
griffin.
actually, my ex-boyfriend, griffin.
griffin, this is my ex-boyfriend,
gale.
what's up?
everything.
so listen.
i know we had some stuff,
but i'm making changes.
okay, i sat down with my life coach
and i cleared out everything...
except for you.
so suddenly i'm more important
than learning the banjo?
griffin, you wanted to
ask me something. remember?
- it's very nice meeting you.
- that's what people tell me.
what was i supposed to do?
her ex-boyfriend showed up.
nothing, there's nothing you could do.
fleeing was the right call.
in fact, fleeing is the new fighting.
i know we flee...
but humans are supposed to be
at the top of the food chain...
so i think we should just ask joe.
joe!! why are you so concerned
with what the stupid lion would do?
do you realize that if monkeys'
canine teeth were a little bigger...
we'd hold the title,
king of the jungle?
let me ask you something,
can the king of the jungle do this?
he's behind me. i saw him mid-flip.
cut her from the herd.
cut her from the herd.
that's a good call, joe.
as long as this other guy's in
the picture, you ain't got a chance.
next time you see her, get her alone.
that's how you'll get your girl.
♪ that's how you gonna get your girl
♪ that's how you gonna get your girl
yeah, yeah
♪ that's how you get a girl
that's how you get a, get a girl
just focus on the lyrics.
you know what? it's worth
a shot, i'll try it tomorrow.
i basically had
the same advice joe did...
but he kind of stole my thunder.
- you coming, barry?
- okay, you're not listening.
i gotta be honest, guys,
my legs fell asleep when we sat down.
i think i'm here overnight.
hey. hey, look, my bus was late.
i need a bike.
sorry, but that big wedding party
just cleaned me out.
yeah, that's my group.
please, you got to have something.
that's right.
cut her from the herd.
how weak.
hey, stephanie.
- that's how you're playing it?
- stay away from her.
- share the road.
- i'm not good at sharing.
this is not right.
stop it, this is...
very dangerous out here.
- oh, my gosh.
- get off the road!
move it. coming through.
- taste the heel.
- hey, easy.
- taste it.
- stop it.
i will not get the deposit back
if you do that.
oh, sweet nanny, that is painful.
oh, jesus. that is fiberglas. stop it.
oh, jesus.
- hey.
- oh, grif.
you're like a daredevil.
so listen, i've been thinking...
i was thinking about...
hold on a second.
everything just turned light blue.
my body's starting to shut down.
- oh no! are you okay?
- yeah, yeah, yeah.
- okay, i'm good.
- okay.
i was thinking about the wedding.
i was wondering if maybe you needed
someone to go with you, that i...
oh, look, griffin,
i need to tell you something.
yeah?
i'm gonna go to the wedding with gale.
he was supposed to come with me
before we broke up...
and we had this long talk
and i'm really confused right now.
i hope you understand.
and i hope you understand that, that
is fantastic. it's better this way.
- really?
- yes, yeah. yes, yeah.
- okay.
- all right.
all right. bye.
get ready to experience
the hail of gale.
cherokee style.
you said to cut her from the herd,
i did.
you see this is what happens. i
should've never listened to you guys.
we didn't tell you to back down.
you'd better stick to your
cozy life...
because take it from me,
you would never make it in the wild.
what did you just say?
i'm saying in the wild,
i would never let a
rival dictate the
outcome of a situation.
"in the wild"?
you were born in captivity, joe.
in this very zoo. i bottle-fed you.
"in the wild." you've never been
in the wild a day in your life.
i could walk 25 yards
and buy a balloon on a stick.
- "wild."
- you're missing the point.
whether you're taking out a rival
or taking down prey...
it's not just the attack, it's about
everything leading up to it.
okay, if i'm not mistaken...
the females in the pride,
they do the hunting.
- we do.
- thank you.
and the fighting.
okay, you know what?
are you giving the advice?
if you are, i don't need to be here.
yeah, you heard me, i will walk.
relax, joe.
the best way for a male
to attract a female...
is to be seen with another female.
if he's going to the wedding,
he needs a date.
that's it. good night.
find a date, sweetie.
i'll do that.
so basically you're using me.
not basically, i am.
this is very junior high,
you do realize that.
it is, i admit it, i am not proud.
i don't think you should have to
go through all this to get her back.
- no, i do, i definitely do.
- i don't know.
yeah, you always said ,
you can't remember
the last time we went on a date.
this isn't a real date.
if i'm gonna go on a fake date,
i was hoping i'd fake date a doctor.
or somebody french.
please.
if you do this for me, i will...
give you half my lunch for the
next three years.
you know what?
and this, to sweeten it.
that's a signing bonus, if you do.
take it, look at that.
all right, i'll go.
but i'm calling you francois dubois,
cardiologist.
you can call me betty,
as long as you're going.
hey, buddy.
got a little something for you.
happy birthday...
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
it's out. it's out. i'm sorry.
i was just messing with you.
oh, my god.
yeah, i mean, don't do that to me.
it's a gelatine cake.
kate made it for you.
- she's a good lady.
- oh, my heart's racing, man.
was that on a plate?
- no, you're good.
- thank kate for me.
that's it? you're all birthday-ed out?
i'm sure you got things to do.
actually, we do.
how are we gonna pull this off?
- i don't exactly blend in.
- it's simple.
once we get out, we just tell people
we're going to a costume party.
- no one's gonna believe that.
- maybe not at first.
but when you put on this shirt
and talk, they will.
griffin, i'd hug you, but it's
fifty-fifty i'd crush your spine.
you know what? fist bump works.
- my wrist.
- oh, man, i'm sorry.
payback, baby. come on.
come on, let's go. let's go.
- can i drive?
- no, you cannot.
please?
sorry, bern, not happening.
look at that up there.
i'm so alive.
take it easy, man. no problem.
here it comes, you ready?
shut up.
hi, y'all, welcome to friday's.
can i interest you in... ?
yeah, we were just at a costume party.
- zookeeper.
- gorilla.
preppy gorilla.
and then we noticed there was already
a gorilla so we were like:
<i>you know what? let's put wings on this
loser train and get our friday's on.</i>
- you look so freaking real.
- he does, yeah.
can i try on your head?
yeah, no, l... you know...
it's all hooked on
with wires and what-not.
and stink. this thing hasn't
been washed in years.
i think the last guy who wore it
might have thrown up.
yeah.
can i get your order?
i'm just gonna go with the baby backs
and some fries.
and for you?
thirty oranges.
no, bernie, that's ice.
buddy, that's cold.
should've warned you. oh my god.
it's called a brain freeze
right there.
gonna get worse before it gets better.
ride it. ride it.
gonna subside in about 10 seconds.
yeah, that's ice, but it's deadly.
deadly.
we'd like to send that table of
secretaries a basket
of zucchini fries.
you got it.
yeah.
my eyes.
yeah.
i'm so glad i met you.
penny for your thoughts?
just hanging out,
enjoying your company.
so there's talk
you might leave the zoo.
i was just upset. thought that's what
i needed to do to get stephanie back.
no, bernie,
i'm afraid you're stuck with me.
i wanna thank you.
tonight you gave me
more than i could ever ask for.
you're very welcome, bernie.
you're a good friend.
hell, you're my best friend.
i just made this weird, didn't i?
no, no, not at all.
okay, good.
can i try on your watch?
now it's getting weird.
what are you doing out of
your enclosure? someone can see you.
- no, no one's around.
- we were worried about you.
tell me you're not wearing that
to the wedding.
no, no, no.
i got an outfit all picked out.
all set with the other female?
got it covered, kate's coming with me.
- oh, good choice.
- thanks.
- joe, anything else for griffin?
- what would i know?
- you're the expert on everything.
- god, your mother ruined you.
she did not. your mother ruined you.
has anyone got a game plan
for the ex-boyfriend?
we forgot about him.
look. i couldn't help overhearing.
you wanna intimidate a rival?
you gotta do this.
and if that doesn't work,
assume attack position.
okay, if i was in a pond
that would be my go-to move.
- i respect that.
- maybe you better take me with you.
- bernardo.
- oh, my god, it's bernie.
hey, that's great.
- bernie, you made it.
- all right, all right.
let's not make a big deal out of this.
here's what i'm thinking.
take me along, you know,
just in case you need some backup.
- bern, i gotta do this on my own.
- i'll sit at another table.
you won't even know i'm there.
i've got unbelievable mingling skills.
bernie, you're a gorilla.
i can't believe you just went there.
all right, fine.
but if you get in a jam, call us.
- will do, all right?
- we're gonna need your cell phone.
- what?
- hand it over.
fine. here you go.
thanks. thanks, guys.
all right, everybody back to
your enclosures before the zoo opens.
- where did you get the watch?
- don't you worry about it.
venom?
i got you. i've got you covered.
sure this is gonna help
with the ladies?
hey, venom,
i need to ask you a favor...
franky.
- venom, i need to borrow your car.
- absolutely.
- gonna need your keys.
- oh, yeah, they're in my pocket.
oh, i had a little dust-up
with the copperhead.
yeah, i won't be able to move the arm
for another six hours.
go get yourself some keys, brother.
other pocket.
thanks.
- are you kidding me?
- what?
you look amazing.
- thank you.
- no.
no, you overdid it. don't you see?
you look too good for me.
people are gonna know it's a setup.
oh, my god. oh, my god.
what did you want me to do?
come in my work clothes?
no, no, we don't have time now.
thank you.
yeah, you would know.
here, come here.
she didn't notice us at the church,
now she's gone. she's just gone.
so, we tussle a little bit ....
there she is.
then the sea lion lets me go.
thirty seconds later, i resurface.
and he's killing over there.
it's not happening.
so, what's the game plan here?
'cause this whole clinically depressed
energy is not getting the job done.
- i can't compete with him, all right?
- i don't care.
and to this day, you can't say
my name around jose canseco.
i know.
give me your hand.
what?
come on.
she's looking.
- you positive she saw us?
- yes.
- she just looked over here.
- laugh.
- what?
- laugh like we're really having fun.
okay, take it down.
- i'm gonna throw up.
- no, no, no, it's okay.
just keep... don't look...
turn away...
- oh, god, i just sucked in a fuzz.
- are you okay?
okay, everybody,
i know tonight isn't about me...
but my beautiful girlfriend,
stephanie and i...
recently won
a ballroom dancing competition.
i hardly had any lessons,
but i'm wicked athletic...
and like i said, we won.
now, tonight in honor of
the bride and groom,
we'd like to perform our
winning dance.
get up.
oh my god! this is our song.
this is my song with stephanie.
no, it couldn't be.
- are you sure?
- yes.
no. no.
okay, this is definitely the song,
then.
maybe it's a coincidence.
it's a very popular song.
maybe it means she is really
thinking about you.
i'll wait.
i don't believe this.
this is a clear statement.
it's premeditated, very definitive.
she knew exactly what she was doing.
this is definitely on purpose.
we are...
okay, okay.
can you do any of that?
no.
okay, you're gonna do it.
we're gonna do it.
we're gonna do it.
oh, man, they're good.
he's lifting her.
how did they...? wait.
they practiced, i have a dress on.
wait. i can do this one.
hold me, grab me.
- have you got me?
- you know what? i have you.
no one's looking. get off.
thank you, thank you.
all right, freestyle.
us too, over here.
he did a push-up. he did a push-up.
- well, that was really great.
- they're, like, the perfect couple.
hold on a sec.
this is our song.
come on. come on.
did you know...
that the female eagle...
is attracted to the male...
that can fly the highest?
soar with me.
oh, my gosh.
yeah.
you know what?
i'm gonna go get some air. okay.
thanks.
- madame, please, don't touch that.
- sorry.
okay. all right.
come back here. get down.
this is prohibited.
what's he doing?
griffin.
again, i'm so sorry and i'm gonna
reimburse you for everything.
don't even sweat it, all right.
the ice sculpture was
her mother's idea.
- how is robin's leg?
- oh, she's fine.
- it was more of a pull than a tear.
- i hit her so flush.
- she just went with the fall.
- the legs were:
- agile.
- yeah, she's bendy.
don't worry about it. relax.
all right. thanks, bro.
listen.
i don't know what you're trying
to prove with all your silk ribbons...
and your fancy moves...
but what do you say
you just back the hell off?
and what do you say we drop the
moves and we settle this like men?
okay. come on, let's go.
i haven't beaten anybody
senseless since my birthday.
what's up? we gonna do this?
what are you doing?
- what are you doing?
- it's attack position.
man, it's gotta suck to be you.
attack.
griffin's phone. go for bernie.
<i>- i split my pants.</i>
- i'm putting you on speaker.
so how's it going?
<i>what part of "split my pants”
don't you get? my butt's hanging out.</i>
<i>i took out an ice sculpture,
gale got in my face, it's a mess.</i>
griffin, if you wanna give up,
i get you.
- he's not giving up.
- okay.
don't back down from that guy.
you get in his face,
make him back down.
<i>as far as the girl goes,
you keep her off balance.</i>
you insult her. that's right.
you make her feel bad.
then you compliment her.
you knock her down, you bring her up.
when she seems interested, walk away.
throw poop at her.
that's how i met karen.
you can do this.
- go.
- close the deal, griffin.
<i>throw the poop.</i>
i'm doing this.
- what's up, puppy-breath?
- what?
just saying looking good,
freckle-chest, yeah.
man, i am hungry.
target sighted.
griffin, what's going on?
four words:
i need dessert, go.
god, you're beautiful.
- i am?
- yeah, but you're still here.
oh, dessert, go...
okay, i'm going.
thanks, boss.
whoa, guy, back for more?
does she talk about me?
sorry?
does she mention me?
does the thought of what
steph and i had haunt you?
you know, keep you up at night?
you mean the way you flamed down?
you mean, do we laugh
every time we see
a couple riding a horse on a beach?
- oh, yeah.
- not that specifically.
every time we see
an engagement ring...
a whisky bottle with a note in it, a
mariachi band, horse stables or sand.
we laugh until we can't breathe.
and then we make out...
hard.
- your name's gale.
- what?
- you have a woman's name.
- no.
no, gale like gale sayers,
the football player.
you wish. perfume and teddy bears.
daddy must have wanted a little girl,
so he named you gale.
- watch it.
- oh, sorry, gale, you're a female.
- hey, man, you better back off.
- want me to back off, crystal gayle?
- you got problems, man.
- yeah, yeah, yeah.
hey.
not in the mood, hammer thumbs.
griffin, gone.
- we're leaving.
- okay.
so tell me everything.
- what was with the robot moves?
- i don't know, i panicked.
i also ripped my pants and
cried a little. it's all a blur.
that was so fun.
can we please do this every weekend?
just show up at weddings and trash
the place? because we are good.
you know, forget good, we're great.
and you what?
we're bigger than weddings.
let me tell you that right now.
- we should rob banks.
- i'm in.
if you would say, "let us knock off
a gas station," i'd do it right now.
give me your hand, feel this.
feel my heartbeat, it's like a rabbit.
- all right.
- oh, my god.
actually, that's not good.
- yeah, no, i gotta get that checked.
- yeah.
and kate, you were incredible.
thank you.
i'm really glad that you asked me
to come out tonight.
francois.
i heard what happened.
i'm so sorry.
gale can be such an idiot.
hey, i know you.
- you're that little zoo girl, right?
- kate, yeah.
okay, thank you so much
for saving us from that lion.
oh, my god, i almost passed out.
i was so scared.
grif, do you think maybe we could
go somewhere and talk?
- can we just have a sec?
- sure.
it worked. can you believe it?
yeah.
that's... that's amazing.
- that's what we came here for, right?
- it is, i...
- you need to do this.
- yeah?
- yes, yes.
- you helped so much, thank you.
no, i'm just gonna take a taxi,
or a shuttle or something.
- go, go.
- are you sure?
i can't believe it, thank you.
hey, stephanie.
- hey.
- hi.
<i>okay, let's review your order.</i>
<i>that'll be 64 meat lover's pizzas,
<i>and can i interest you in
our new fudge roll?</i>
yes.
<i>all right, let's see,
that's a total of $1636 74.</i>
<i>will that be cash or credit?</i>
hang it up, hang it up.
so close.
i am so happy right now.
you know that, ever feel that?
all the time, like...
are you happy right now?
because right now i'm so happy.
and it's just like, all of a sudden
it just hits you, like,
bam, i'm happy now.
gosh, you know, i have a fashion show
tomorrow, i want you to come.
tomorrow, i'm supposed to work.
sad face.
- how about instead...
- what?
you come to the zoo.
i give you a private tour.
that's a terrible idea.
i really thought you were different.
but the same old zoo stuff.
you know what?
let someone else zoo-keep tomorrow.
- really?
- yeah.
i don't remember this griffin.
yeah, well, you get used to it
because now it's all about you.
- okay.
- you know what else?
you got a bat in the cave.
yeah, she got a booger.
- no, don't say that.
- gross.
no, other side, nostril.
take care of that.
- i'm going to the bathroom.
- you better.
- don't go anywhere.
- not going anywhere.
- throw out the napkin.
- okay, i'm so sorry.
- dead empty when you get back, woman.
- okay.
jurgen. jurgen.
- stephanie.
- hi.
kiss, kiss.
this is jurgen milraux.
who is this chaotic pile of man?
he's ruining the vibes here.
he is a waste of space.
i'm sorry, what?
you scream, "help me,
i'm worthless and funny-looking."
can l...?
- can i ask you a question?
- yes.
- hey, siegfried, where's roy?
- what?
how's the chocolate factory,
willy wonka?
i'm sorry, but you walked
right into that one, grandma hair.
grandma hair?
<i>♪ he got the grandma hair,
he got the grandma hair.</i>
i don't understand one word.
here's what you have to understand,
your face is a poem.
i feel...
...pleasure.
whoa, let's put the donkey
back in the barn.
gonna mingle.
you were awesome in there.
oh, my god, my friends love you.
you were so great. i gotta say,
you are really getting there.
look, i hope you don't mind
but i talked to your brother...
and you have a job at the dealership
if you want it.
is that pushy?
hey, you know what? fine, i'm pushy.
it's just...
i think that that zoo
is really holding you back.
you deserve better.
we deserve better.
we?
good call, glenn.
an animal like you on this bad boy?
it's top of the food chain. follow.
shana, wanna grab us
an espresso and a montblanc?
- we're having a signing party.
- yes, sir.
enjoy the hunt.
dancing.
- back off, nimer.
- you back off.
- oh, not cool.
- yeah.
what's up?
- welcome to the dream.
- help!
i don't like this thing!
make it stop, make it stop!
- that looks difficult.
- you know what's not difficult?
giving a supermodel the bad news...
that i can't date you because
i'm already dating a supermodel.
yeah.
- i gotta say, this is incredible.
- where have you been?
that's what i wanted
to talk to you about, i...
it's time.
oh, my god, he's calling,
letting her know he's here.
watch this, look, look, look.
- aren't they amazing?
- yeah, no...
they're great.
they're fast and sincere.
- did you know they mate for life?
- i do now.
listen, kate, i wanted you
to be the first to know...
that i took a job working
for my brother at his dealership.
- shut up.
- i'm serious, i figured i'd...
i'd done everything i set out to do
in the zoo game and it was ....
the zoo game? what the hell
are you talking about, griffin?
you love working here, you're great
at it. the animals love you.
yeah, but maybe that's not enough.
yeah, maybe it's time i just start
thinking about myself.
okay, is this coming
from you or stephanie?
no, it's my decision. i mean, she
thinks it's a good idea, but i do too.
not buying it. you can't see
what's happening here?
yeah, i am changing me.
no, she's changing you
into something that you're not.
well, maybe what i was before
wasn't what i was.
and it is now, maybe, that it is
if it is the way it is.
- you're not even making any sense.
- makes enough sense that you get it.
okay, look...
if you wanna quit,
i'm not gonna stand in your way.
but i want you to look me in the eye,
and tell me that this is actually
what you really want.
it is.
there you have it.
hey, bern...
got your favorite.
- hey, listen, i just wanted to...
- save it.
i already heard.
you know, you almost had me
convinced things could be different.
that i could actually trust
someone again.
you can.
oh, i gotta take this. one sec.
yo, go for grif.
no, mohegan blue.
chrome wheel package, buddy.
papers are all ready for you,
make it happen, slam it.
all right, gotta go.
oh, sorry, bern.
all people lie and
i was an idiot to believe you.
hey, shane.
i'm gonna let you in
on a little something.
ten years ago,
you and bernie had an incident.
i know what you did.
i also know you lied about it.
so?
so if you ever do
anything like that again...
i will go to your house and i will
beat you in front of your mother.
i'm telling you, vern, this baby does
zero to 60 in under four seconds.
yeah, i don't know, i...
- i got grandkids.
- that's even better.
you stick them back here.
you tell them it's a secret cave.
i can't take it. i miss griffin.
i know you can't see it
but my lip won't stop quivering.
well, he wouldn't be gone if
you'd listened to me.
you're the one that talk to him first.
- yeah, he's right, you know?
- i can't take it.
- you're killing us with the crying.
- you were sobbing all night.
- i wasn't, i have sleep apnea.
- sounded like baby-crying to me.
- baby-crying.
- what did you say, thumbs?
why don't you come back
here and say it to my face.
i leave this tree,
i'm slapping you silly.
you come down here
and i'll use you as a loofah.
how're you gonna hold me?
you have no thumbs.
oh, yeah?
let's do this. i'll start from
my back. bring it.
that's it, i'm quitting my diet.
you can't quit something
you never started.
- you know what i think we should do?
- not a zoo animal!
hey, kate.
hey, venom.
oh, what are they doing out?
grieving. they miss griffin.
- oh, i know how they feel.
- yeah.
look, venom, i'm sorry,
but i'm leaving the zoo tomorrow.
- you too?
- yeah.
the eagle enclosure is up and running
so i'm taking a job in nairobi.
why?
i was gonna pass because i started
having feelings for someone here...
but he's with somebody else, so....
you know?
i do.
what are you doing?
oh, what are you doing?
don't you play possum.
- what?
- you know?
you started having feelings.
come on, "someone here."
i was talking about griffin.
tragic misread of situation.
<i>feel as though
you're breathing through your eyes.</i>
hey, babe, how was your day?
did you sell a lot of cars?
three, but you know what? one
guy, he didn't feel like he needed it.
- do you love it?
- trying to complete the pose ....
- is that a chair?
- yes, it's a chintoko.
- really?
- there's only five
like it in the entire world.
sit, sit, sit.
- yeah, okay.
- i love it.
- isn't it comfy, cozy?
- yeah.
totally amazing. i just think
this whole place looks so great.
it's really just...
it's coming together.
i'm so happy.
really gives this whole room
a nice zhuzh. you know what i mean?
hey, you know what? i ordered in
dinner tonight from le chereaux.
oh, you know what else?
that just reminds me, we have an
absinthe tasting on mathieu sailboat.
- yeah, mathieu.
- do you remember him?
he's disgustingly rich.
okay, i gotta get my yoga.
hey babe, you think it's bad feng shui
that we have a tv in the living room?
i feel if i do yoga in here...
it will counterbalance
the whole bad juju, you know?
bad juju of the tv.
wait till i show you
this new dress i bought.
what's wrong?
hoping for someone else?
hungry?
guys, see that lady over there?
i just sold her an extended warranty
we don't even have.
nice, guy, nice.
we've got a high roller checking out
the mercedes mclaren.
knock yourself out, nimer.
oh, you got a good eye.
griffin constantine keyes.
the changes i've seen in you...
these past few weeks
have been nothing short of remarkable.
and i've been doing
a little soul-searching.
and i made a mistake five years ago
on that beach.
and i wanna correct it.
- so will you...?
- yeah, not gonna happen.
what?
come on, you had to see this coming.
look, when we first started dating
you assumed i was gonna turn into...
the type of guy
you always dreamed about.
but you know what?
i don't like that guy.
i don't like this job.
i don't, bro, i'm sorry.
it's not... yeah, this i love.
but we'll always have this, you know?
i love you, right? okay, good.
i don't like this suit.
i don't like our chintaki chairs.
- chintoko.
- either one, i don't like them.
i don't like the facts
that i can't understand
stuff you talk about.
but most of all,
i hate who i've become.
i'll ignore them.
shut up.
shut up, he didn't say yes.
i'm not gonna pay you.
come back for your watch?
no, i came back to see if you were
interested in happy hour at friday's.
look, if you're here just to
yank my chain...
i'm not. i wanna tell you i'm sorry.
and i know i let you down.
and that you... you're my best friend.
and, oh, yeah, i...
i dumped stephanie.
- nicely done.
- yeah.
- hey, what happened to your eye?
- it's good to have you back, grif.
hey, griffin, you're back.
oh, everyone's gonna be so happy.
you know what, right now i gotta
go talk to kate, okay?
griffin, kate's gone.
- she's leaving for africa tonight.
- what?
she's on a 9:15 flight.
oh, man, it's my fault.
- i blew it.
- it's my fault.
i was the who told you
to be someone you're not.
no, you know what? it's my fault.
i was so worried you were gonna leave,
i wasn't thinking about you.
it's not my fault. i said
throw poop at her, always works.
who cares whose fault it is?
there's still time. let's get kate.
follow me, everyone.
nothing can stand in our way.
wow, he is really hauling.
oh, he stopped.
he's eating a pretzel.
you know what!
barry is right, i'm going to get her.
wait, it's bumper to bumper from here
to the airport. whoa, almost took off.
my gosh, you're right.
it's rush hour, i'll never make it.
i can get you there.
i'm the fastest animal in the zoo.
plus, i fit in the bike lane. hop on.
hop off, hop off.
new plan. follow me.
griffin, i got your back, baby.
wait, where you going?
hey, griffin, you nut.
what are you doing back there?
nothing, everything is fine.
can't be in that area,
it's unauthorized.
i know but a guy inside said it's
okay. they will allow it this time.
all right! listen, i'm having a party
saturday night, a blowout.
sounds good, i'm there.
i love blowouts.
- it's gonna be wild.
- yeah, yeah... i'll see you saturday.
- where you going, griffin?
- hey, come on... get out.
- i can do this.
- wait, don't leave.
- okay.
- can't you hear what i'm saying?
hey, griffin! i'm saying...
hey.
hang on a second.
where are we going?
you can't leave me here.
i'm out of the zoo without my izod.
griffin, what a surprise.
hi, mrs. d.
hey.
ma!
- take a cookie, sweetie.
- oh, thanks, mrs. d.
ma!
- come on, the road's blocked.
- yeah, oh...
how about this?
i'll go around the back.
come on. what do we do?
oh, you...
you know what?
a heads up would be nice.
go, i'll meet you there.
kate!
wait, stop!
kate!
oh, god, she's gone.
- it's over.
- it's not over.
get in.
- stay in sync.
- i'm trying.
your arms are twice as long as mine.
hurry, we gotta cut her off at the
bridge or she's gone.
row, gorilla, row.
come on, use those big arms, baby.
now we're doing it.
row, row, row.
bernie.
i was kind of hoping we'd
see some steps.
- get on.
- what?
- get on my back.
- okay.
you know what?
i don't think i can do this.
i'm afraid of heights.
- oh, no.
- don't look down.
- that's not helping.
- don't look up.
bernie, i'm looking down.
this is not good, give me your hand.
there she is.
hurry, she's on the move.
what are you stopping for?
just be yourself, griffin.
that's all you need to do.
- now go get your girl.
- how?
- griffin?
- kate, hey.
- oh, my god, are you okay?
- yeah.
- what the hell are you doing?
- i was cartwheeling.
- what?
- i...
oh, you said...
- you said eagles, they mate for life.
- yes.
well, when an eagle finds it's
perfect mate, they cartwheel, right?
that's what they do.
they lock their talons together
and they spin out of control.
and just before they hit the ground,
they break apart.
the only difference
between me and an eagle is...
i will hit the ground as
you've just seen.
you said you were done
with the zoo game.
i thought i had to change
who i was to be happy...
but i was wrong.
kate, it took me five years
to get over someone
i wasn't even in love with.
i can't imagine how long it would 
take to get over you.
and on a side note, i may have
crushed an ostrich getting here.
i don't wanna know.
i don't wanna know.
- he's fine, he's...
- no, no.
yeah, we should get him back,
we should.
wait a sec. what the heck is benihana?
you still got your izod?
get it.
i can't get it off.
i don't know what that was.
share the road. you all right?
- are you okay?
- yeah.
what is he doing?
that's a crazy stance right there.
you don't stay... you...
i mean, you just stay,
don't go anywhere.
yeah, baby.
okay, that...
whoa, man, i feel like i went
through a car wash right then.
all right, all right, be careful.
