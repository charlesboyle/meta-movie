- nothin', nothin' at all.
- send it again.
i've been sendin' it up and down the coast 
from sarasota to the everglades.
it's still getting back
the same day it aired.
there's nothing. there's nobody, 
or at least nobody with a radio.
all right then. let's set down.
we'll use the bullhorn.
set down? wait a minute.
that's not in our contract.
it's the biggest city within 150 miles.
we're gonna give it every chance.
- jesus, mary and joseph.
- set down, john.
i'll set us down, but i won't leave my seat, and
i'll keep the engine running.
now, the first sign
of trouble, i'm going up.
if you ain't on board when that happens,
you're likely to have a lousy afternoon.
calling anybody
on this frequency.
this is helicopter 4-0-alpha.
if you can hear me,
please listen carefully.
hello?
hello?
is anyone there?
hello?
hello?
is anyone there?
hello?
is anyone there?
is anyone there?
hello?
is there anyone there?
hello?
hello?
is there anyone there?
hello?
hello?
is anyone there?
hello?
we can lift you out to safety. please answer
my call if you can hear me.
forget it, billy boy.
it's a dead place.
they got the others, you know.
listen.
you can hear it
over the engine.
jesus, mary and joseph.
hey, you find anything?
yeah. a bunch of real estate for sale
at closeout prices, man.
gas up the machine.
she's down to fumes.
no. wait till it's dark.
there are too many of them out there.
yeah-hey, it's no good
to leave the gas tank empty.
- suppose we need to get out of here in a hurry.
- then we're shit out of luck.
they're getting too riled up.
do it tonight when they can't see you.
they know we're in here even if they can't see us.
what good is it to leave the gas tank emp...
the activity excites them. there are too many
of them. and more and more every day.
if we get a lot more, come out and shoot some.
otherwise, stay inside the building.
stay out of sight. be thankful you live
in the suburbs, johnson.
you oughta see how congested
the city's gettin' to be.
miguel, come on.
let's get below.
- miguel, what can i do? you... you...
- what?
- let me help.
- no. i... i don't need help. i don't need help.
- come on. give me this.
- i'm all right. i'm just tired.
- you're not. you're collapsing from stress. now, let me help...
- collapsing from stress?
we're all collapsing. this whole fucking unit
is collapsing...
everybody except you.
i know you're strong,
all right? so what?
stronger than me. stronger than everyone.
so what?
so fucking what?
- that's a new grave.
- major cooper. he died this morning.
and then there were 12.
a burial this morning.
that's why there are so many of them.
what's gonna bring them tomorrow, sarah?
and the next day and the next day after?
there are hundreds of 'em over there, thousands.
a million of them!
you stick your head in the sun, they're gonna
come up  behind you and bite off your ass!
- this is bullshit. crazy.
- if you've got an alternative, we'd be happy to listen to it.
i got an alternative.
let's get the whirlybirdy good idea.
find us an island someplace, get juiced up...
and spend what time we got left
soakin' up some sunshine.
- how's that?
- you could do that, couldn't you?
with all that's going on, you could do that
without a second thought?
right. i could do that even if all 
this wasn't goin' on.
- another waste of time, right?
- got that right, man.
- what'd you find?
- nothin'.
nothin'? how far up the coast did you go?
a hundred miles each way.
jump in here, soldier. we gotta bring in 
two more dumb fucks. let's go.
- two more? what's logan doing to them in there?
- get in here soldier.
he's been awake for 24 hours.
can't you get anyone else?
what "anyone else"?
there isn't anyone else. we're it.
the two of you can't go in there alone.
it's too dangerous.
christ. i'll go!
- what's the matter with your friend there?
- there's nothing the matter.
all right. let's go.
you got it, steel.
let's kick it out.
come on. step forward.
this shows the 15th as the last time you
took any out.
- that can't be right.
- oh, yeah. we forget to write 'em up sometimes.
you've got to write them up.
it's essential.
can't you get that
through your thick skull?
how the hell are we supposed
to keep track of how many we got left?
let's go, you dumb fucks!
get over here!
hey! here we are!
come on!
come on, you dumb fucks.
come on. come on.
come on, you fish brains. 
what the hell's the matter with ya?
- they're scared.
- huh?
they know what'll happen
when frankenstein gets 'em.
if you're right, rickles, then they're learning.
they're actually learning.
come on!
come and see what i got for you!
come on, you dick faces!
here's a nice one hangin'.
come on. come and get it.
- come and try to bite it off!
- that's it. whip it out. that'll bring 'em on.
fuckin' "a."
biggest piece of meat in the cave.
i don't wanna excite the lady though.
not with her boyfriend around.
you're incapable of exciting me, steel, except
as an anthropological curiosity.
- what the hell's that mean, rickles?
- it means you're a caveman.
you're a fuckin' throwback.
you've been spendin' too much time underground, huh?
it's okay, steel.
throwbacks all got big dicks.
oh!
all right, you dumb fucks!
get over here, you scumbags!
your old pal steel
wants to see ya.
- shit.
- i'm coming up.
you're not strong enough for up here.
send up the pole. i'll watch out for lover boy.
don't worry. i'm not strong enough?
i've done it dozens of times.
i don't want you up here, lady.
send up the pole. they're gettin' closer.
he's clamping. look at 'im.
let go of the pole.
listen to me.
let go of the goddamn pole.
here they come! let's go!
dumb fucks.
pus-breeding bags of shit.
you dumb-fucking bags of shit,
i'll kick your fuckin' asses. come on!
come here, scumbag.
hook her up, will ya? hook her.
hey, nice hat, asshole.
come on!
get the other one out of there!
steel, steel, steel,
cover! cover!
i got it.
- geez.
that's it. that's it.
that's it. i got it. i got it. come on.
come on. come here.
come here.
you almost killed rickles.
yeah. you almost killed rickles.
let 'im go, steel.
- he shouldn't have been
up there in the first place.
steel, stop it!
you dirty son of a bitch!
let him go! let him go,
goddamn it,
or i'll cut you in half.
shut up, you dumb fucks.
i hope they chop you up for dog meat.
come on, rickles.
let's get out of here.
i hope you fuckin' rot!
fuck you!
i am not gonna let you
dope me up.
you need a sedative.
you're behaving dangerously.
- i'm just trying to help you, miguel.
- well, i don't need your help, or anyone else's.
you made me look like an asshole out there.
you made me feel
like a piece of shit.
you stay away from me
with that, sarah.
you stay away from me.
ohh.
you bitch.
we've got to have sterile conditions.
half the work we do...
goes down the toilet
due to contamination.
- you'll work with what you got, fisher.
- but it's madness!
- can't you understand...
- i understand this: you and your playmates,
you're running out of friends
fast around here.
look, major cooper
promised that...
major cooper is dead.
i'm in command now,
and i'm telling you...
that you work
with what you got.
and you'd better
start showing me some results...
or you won't have that
very much longer.
how can we show you results when we don't have
the proper working conditions?
we're in a desperate situation here.
we need each other.
can't we just get along? 
you need us, the way i see it, lady.
i'm not sure we need you at all.
fuckin' "a."
i'm not even sure what the hell it is
you're doin' in there,
just what the hell my men
are riskin' their asses for.
if there was more cooperation, your men wouldn't
have to risk their asses as often.
- miguel salazar's in bad shape.
- no shit.
i want him pulled off active duty for a while
until we can evaluate his condition.
- can't spare 'im.
- he's over the edge. he's turning into jell-o.
- jell-o?
- that's the way the spicks say "yellow": jell-o!
miguel is seriously disturbed. 
he's close to the breaking point,
and that's dangerous
for all of us.
he can't handle
any more stress right now.
well, maybe i should cut off
his extracurricular activities.
maybe you're keepin' him too busy at night.
we're talking about a man's life here,
you son of a bitch.
and the lives of others
he might put in jeopardy.
- maybe i should put him in quarantine.
how about it, steel?
you call it, captain.
i'll build him a cage.
yeah. might not be a bad idea...
give some of the rest of us a shot at some lovin'.
hey, it's gonna
be a long winter.
come on, ted.
let's get out of here.
i'm callin' a meeting
for 7:00 tonight.
i want everybody present.
everybody, lady,
including dr. frankenstein
and including your boyfriend.
- i gave him a sedative. he won't be awake.
- look here, woman.
i'm short on man power.
i won't have you goin' around...
dopin' up any of my men
without orders from me.
- is that clear?
- yes, sir!
fuck you, sir!
out of the frying pan,
into the fire.
i thought cooper was an asshole, but he was 
a sweetheart next to rhodes.
we could be in real trouble.
you'd better watch yourself... i mean, physically watch yourself.
i can handle it.
don't worry. it's not going to come to that.
- we've just gotta pound some logic into their heads.
- impossible.
where's dr. logan?
frankenstein?
he's in his laboratory. where else?
there's a loss of initiative, caution,
many of the human cognitive functions.
apparently the result of decay
in the frontal, parietal,
temporal and occipital lobes.
on revival, the rate of decomposition
slows substantially.
indications are that these beings...
could function over a period of years...
in cases of early revival, 10 to 12 years
before decay would threaten mobility.
the brain is the engine, sarah,
the motor that drives them.
they don't need any blood flow, don't need any
of their internal organs.
now, i've severed all
the vital organs in this one.
there's nothing left of the corpse but brain
and limbs, and still it functions.
oh, look, sarah. look.
see, it wants me.
it wants food, but it has no stomach.
it can take no nourishment
from what it ingests.
it's working on instinct, a deep, dark,
primordial instinct.
decomposition occurs first in the frontal lobes,
the neocortex,
and next in the limbic system,
the middle brain.
but the core... the core is the last thing to be
attacked by the decay.
it's the "r" complex, sarah... that central bit of
prehistoric jelly...
that we inherited
from the reptiles.
here. i've gone into the center here
and attacked the "r" complex discretely.
i've removed it from the equation...
this corpse.
i believe this creature would be benign even 
if it had its eyesight and its other senses.
its primitive instincts
have been erased.
it still has motor function,
probably still has powers of deliberation.
it can be domesticated,
sarah, don't you see?
it can be conditioned to behave the way
we want it to behave.
and all that's required
is 15 hours of fancy surgery...
that only a handful of people
are trained to do.
we were going to stop work on the neurophysical,
concentrate on something more practical.
these finds are central to the condition.
i will not stop work...
that might lead to an answer, let alone
in an area that is central to the condition.
but you're just proving theories
that were advanced months ago.
and you're not even proving them correctly.
you're making a lot of assumptions.
you're wasting time trying
to define what's happening...
instead of looking
for what's making it happen.
and just slicing up too many specimens.
it's extremely dangerous...
to go up on top
and round them up in the wild.
well, we can't control them.
what happened to this one?
it was too unruly.
i couldn't handle it. i had to destroy it.
- we can still get information from it.
- dr. logan,
we are losing
the cooperation of the men.
i'm not even sure they'll go up top when we
run out of the specimens we have.
i'm not sure they won't just try to 
shut us down completely.
well, i'll show them results.
i'll show them results.
i'll show them that these creatures 
can be domesticated even without the surgery.
knowing what they are, we can
begin to approach them properly,
condition them, control them.
we've got to do this, sarah.
it's our only hope.
yes, this is major cooper.
i needed him, sarah. he's helping us more now
than he ever did when he was alive.
- but i saw the grave.
- they buried one of the specimens.
jesus. god, logan.
do you know what they'll do to you
if they find out about this?
- do you know what they'll do to all of us?
- they'll never find out.
he can't be recognized.
not a peep. long-range or short, high-band or low, 
i can't raise anybody.
how can that be, mcdermott?
there must be other groups like us.
- somebody else must be tryin' to radio.
- yeah. what the hell is this?
- maybe we are the only ones left.
- i'm sure there's others.
this is not the best place to be sending from,
and a lot of the equipment i'm using...
has been rotting down here
since the second world war.
well, it's up to you
to get it workin' right.
lay off the fuckin' booze
for a while, why don't ya?
and get somebody
on that fuckin' horn, pronto.
well, if we stay down here long enough,
i'll have to lay off the fuckin' booze, steel,
'cause there won't fuckin'
be any of it fuckin' left.
in the meanwhile, i will continue to indulge myself,
and i will continue doing my best...
in the good fight
against dry rot and rust.
yeah? well, your best
ain't good enough, asshole.
you think i'm not aware of our situation?
you think i want to stay isolated down here?
you know, i'd make a desperate
effort to raise somebody...
just in the hope of gettin' away
from your nasty mouth, steel.
the fact is...
the fact is...
either we are
the only ones left...
or there's nobody within range of my puny little
second world war signals.
we used to talk to washington all the time.
they could hear us then.
we were on relays then.
we weren't over the air.
you know, the power's off on the mainland now,
in case you haven't heard.
- all the shopping malls are closed.
- we don't appreciate your jokes.
keep it up, and i'll shove that bottle of yours
right up your wise ass.
i've got better things to do than listen 
to this kindergarten. are we finished?
no, we ain't
finished here, lady. sit down.
what else do you want?
we've given you the reports for this week.
- we've given you everything you've asked for.
- you've given us greek salad.
formulas, equations, a lot of fancy terms
that don't mean a thing.
i wanna know if you're doin' something that's gonna
help us out of this deep shit we're in,
or if you're all in there
just jerkin' each other off.
she doesn't have to jerk off like the rest of us, captain.
she got an honest-to-god dick...
to get off on, huh?
it may be yellow,
but it's still a dick!
i said we ain't
finished here, lady.
sit down.
sit down, or so help me,
god, i'll have you shot.
- you'll what?
- i said,
"i'll have you shot."
have you lost your mind?
no, ma'am.
have you? i just told you i was willing 
to kill you if you didn't get back in your chair.
you didn't get back
in your chair.
goddamn it!
you can't shove us around like this.
since when did this
become a military operation?
since i took over.
steel, shoot that woman.
bang! you're dead.
shoot that woman
or you're dead.
you think
i'm fuckin' around, steel?
you're wrong.
now, you got till a count of five,
and that's two you wasted.
that's three.
- four.
- sit down, sarah.
what is this?
shut up and sit down.
that's five, steel.
all right.
all right.
no!
anybody else have any questions about the way
things are gonna run around here from now on?
this ain't
a goddamn field trip, people.
this is a fuckin' war!
i'm not down in this cave for my health.
i'm down here on orders.
your orders are to facilitate
the job of this scientific team.
this is a civilian team, and we don't have to be
subjected to your tyranny.
who's being subjected
to what, fisher?
you've lost one man.
yeah. right.
we've lost five.
where does it say we gotta keep those dumb fucks
next door to where we sleep?
where does it say we should do any one thing
but shoot the mothers in the head?
we don't have enough ammunition
to shoot them all in the head.
the time to have done that
would've been at the beginning.
no. we let them overrun us.
they have overrun us, you know.
we're in the minority now.
something like 400,000 to one,
by my calculations.
i haven't eaten.
is there food?
you were supposed to be here at 7:00 sharp,
mister.
i know. sarah told me.
i'm sorry. i couldn't break away. is there food?
- listen, egghead, let me bring you up to date on what's...
- excuse me.
- let me...
- excuse me!
- is there food?
- i'm runnin' this monkey farm now, frankenstein,
and i wanna know what the fuck
you're doin' with my time!
'cause if we're just
jerkin' off here,
i'm gonna have my men
blow the piss...
out of those precious specimens
of yours,
and we're gonna get the hell out of here  and
leave you and your highfalutin asshole friends...
to rot in this stinkin' sewer!
is that food enough for ya?
where will you go, captain?
you can destroy my specimens,
but what about the millions more
that are waiting to greet you outside?
do you really think you can "blow the piss"
out of them?
all of them? they have you
in a hopeless situation, strategically.
you're lost. well,
you're lost unless...
- unless what? unless what, frankenstein?
- unless you can make them behave.
this is a fuckin' loony bin! i ain't bein'
paid enough to work in a fuckin' loony bin!
- i ain't bein' paid at all!
- paid? what the hell are they payin' him for?
all right. shut up!
just shut up!
what the hell are you
talkin' about, frankenstein?
i'll be able to show you soon enough.
sarah knows.
she's seen the progress i've been making.
isn't that right, sarah?
yes. there's been some progress.
what kind of progress?
what are you talkin' about, "make them behave"?
what does that mean?
it means keeping them from wanting to eat us,
for one thing.
it means keeping them in check,
controlling them.
- controlling them.
- when are you gonna show us something we can understand?
very close. very close.
i think in a matter of weeks...
i don't think there's any way you can tell
how long anything is going to take.
it could be months, it could be years
before we know exactly what we're dealing with.
sarah's research...
sarah's research
is more esoteric than mine.
she's looking for a way to reverse the process,
a way to eradicate the problem.
that could take a long time,
a very long time.
she may never find
what she's looking for.
we have a limited supply
of chemical agents.
our equipment
is hopelessly inadequate.
mcdermott doesn't
have decent radio gear.
now you're tellin' me that you don't
have the shit you need?
we're runnin' low on ammunition.
we're runnin' low on men, for chrissakes!
it was very rushed. this operation
was put together in a matter of days.
yeah, well, it can all be taken apart 
in a matter of minutes, lady,
and i'm here to tell you that i'm ready to
do that little thing.
i'm ready to
take the next train outta here!
i ask you again, captain:
where will you go?
you have no choices. you'll have 
to give us the weeks that we've asked for.
you have to give us however long it takes.
look.
- there have to be survivors in washington.
- my ass.
- they have more sophisticated shelters than this one.
- bullshit.
there have to be people in those shelters
who know about us, who know where we are.
with no radio contact,
they'll come looking for us.
i said shut up!
you got a little more time.
a little more.
i ain't sayin' how much.
but you'd better start showin' me some results,
and you'd better not piss me off.
you understand? nothin' happens
around here without my knowin' about it!
and anybody fucks
with my command,
they get court-martialed,
they get executed.
you'd better know
i mean it, too, people.
he wouldn't have done it.
i can't believe he would've.
no, he wouldn't have done it.
- he would've had steel do it.
- he can't be that inhuman.
- no. he's human.
- that's what scares me, you know.
he won't shoot billy 'cause he doesn't have 
anybody else who knows electronics.
he won't shoot me,
'cause i'm his ride.
he probably won't shoot old frankenstein,
'cause the old doc can talk him silly.
but the rest of you...
better start worrying,
you know.
maybe if we tried working together,
we could ease some of the tensions.
- we're all pulling in different directions.
- that's the trouble, sarah.
people got different ideas
concerning what they want out of life.
you are afraid, aren't you?
just as afraid as i am.
why don't you take a sedative,
sarah, so you can sleep?
you're full of shit, sarah, you know that?
you're really full of shit.
i'm through with you.
fine then. get out.
just get out!
- hey, guys! come on, man!
- for goodness sake!
i'm all right.
thanks, bill.
i'm all right.
here.
i've just filled it up.
got a refill as well.
no, thanks.
i'm all right. really.
it's just brandy.
good for the heart.
it's shit for your heart,
and it eats up your liver.
we don't get a lot of visitors out here,
and we like it that way.
here it is: the ritz.
madam.
john's probably out the back.
hey! well,
what do you know.
welcome to civilization, sarah.
the last holdout.
it's pretty nice.
nicer than we got inside.
- not a bad idea.
- it's a little safer where you are.
but we like to live dangerously,
billy boy and me, you know.
that's a laugh. i haven't seen you do
anything dangerous since we got here.
we stickin' around.
that's gettin' a bit dangerous,
as i hope you noticed
this evening.
you're a mystery to me.
you really are.
not like
those other goons in there.
you have a sense of...
of what?
never mind.
no, no, no.
come on. let's talk about it.
i came down here to get drunk.
i don't have the energy.
hey, hey. it takes more energy to keep quiet
than it does to speak the mind.
go ahead.
let go of what you got, now.
you were sent down here
to do a job.
my job is to fly the whirlybird.
i've been doin' that job just fine.
you have the protection of this facility.
you eat our food. you drink our water.
and you don't lift a finger to help.
neither one of you.
we don't believe in what you're doin' here, sarah.
hey, you know what all they keep down here
in this cave?
man, they got the books and the records of
the top 500 companies.
they got the defense department
budget down here.
and they got the negative
for all your favorite movies.
they got microfilm with tax return
and newspaper stories.
they got immigration records,
census reports,
and they got official accounts of all the wars
and plane crashes...
and volcano eruptions and earthquakes and fires
and floods...
and all the other disasters that interrupted
the flow of things...
in the good old u.s. of a.
now, what does it matter,
sarah darling?
all this filing
and record keeping?
we ever gonna give a shit?
we even gonna get a chance to see it all?
this is a great big 14-mile tombstone!
tombstone!
with an epitaph on it
that nobody gonna bother to read.
now, here you come... here you come with
a whole new set of charts...
and graphs and records.
what you gonna do?
bury them down here with all the other relics...
of what once was?
let me tell you what else.
yeah, i'm gonna tell you what else.
you ain't never gonna figure it out.
just like they never figured out...
why the stars are where they're at.
it ain't mankind's job
to figure that stuff out.
so what you're doin'
is a waste of time, sarah.
and time is all we got left, you know.
what i'm doing...
is all there's left to do.
shame on you.
there's plenty to do.
plenty to do. so long as there's you and me 
and maybe some other people,
we could start over, start fresh,
get some babies.
and teach 'em, sarah, teach 'em never to come
over here...
and dig these records out.
hey.
you want to put some kind
of explanation...
down here before you leave?
here's one as good as any 
you're likely to find.
we're being punished by the creator.
he visited a curse on us...
so we man could look at...
what hell was like.
maybe didn't want to see us
blow ourselves up...
and put a big hole in his sky.
maybe he just wanted to show us 
he was still the boss man.
maybe he figure...we was getting too big
for our britches...
trying to figure his shit out.
you son of a bitch!
damn it!
it's no good.
it's no fuckin' good.
what is that stuff?
it's something called beef treats,
which the army provides us with...
so generously.
- he won't touch it.
- shit. i wouldn't either.
sorry. we're fresh out
of filet mignon.
- what is this?
part of logan's plan...
to try
and socialize these things?
he told me himself they don't eat for nourishment.
what are we hoping for here?
hoping to satisfy the urge.
you see, sarah, they're...
... they are us.
they are the extensions of us.
they are the same animal, simply functioning
less perfectly.
they can be fooled, you see?
they can be tricked into being good little girls and boys,
the same way we were tricked into it on 
the promise of some reward to come.
they have to be rewarded.
reward is the key.
i'm convinced of that now.
come. i've got something
to show you.
that wasn't very nice, you know.
that wasn't very nice at all.
let's go.
and you can just sit there in the dark 
and think about what you've done.
think about it.
think.
i call him bub.
that's what the club fellas used to call my father.
can you imagine a surgeon called bub?
nobody seemed to mind,
though. he was rich.
my father was rich.
he used to say
i'd never be rich doing pure research.
i'd never be rich.
uh, bub's been responding so well lately,
i've let him live.
well, is he alive or dead?
well, that's the question these days, isn't it?
well, let's say that i let him
continue to exist.
hello, bub!
here are some toys for you.
some nice things
for you to play with.
you remember them from before?
from before.
well, he's seen the other things before,
but the book is new.
look, look, look.
i thought he'd do that.
open it up.
he remembers.
he remembers everything that he used to.
bub, i'm very pleased.
very pleased.
what's he trying to prove?
i saw one of those things
sittin' in a car in d. c...
tryin' to drive
down independence avenue.
- it didn't make me wanna be its friend.
- no. it's amazing.
it's not what this one does,
but what he doesn't do.
what do you mean?
he doesn't get excited...
and doesn't get agitated when 
logan walks in the room.
he doesn't see logan as...
...lunch.
dinner.
breakfast.
having fun?
what's he doin' in there?
no need for that, captain.
he's quite docile.
come in.
you can all come in.
bub won't mind.
extraordinary, isn't it?
that's right, bub.
say hello.
come on, captain.
give me a break, will ya?
say hello to your aunt alicia.
say, "hello, aunt alicia."
"hello, aunt alicia."
- hel-lo, aunt alicia.
- "hello."
apparently, he was in the military.
return the salute and see what he does.
you want me to salute that pile
of walking pus?
salute my ass.
your ignorance is exceeded only by your charm,
captain.
how are we going to set an example for them
if we behave barbarically?
take the bullets out, please,
and let me have your pistol, sarah.
it's empty, captain.
we saw the bullets come out.
let's see what he does.
let's see what bub does in this situation.
jesus... christ.
what are we supposed to do?
teach 'em tricks?
what the fuck is wrong with you people?
they're dead!
they're fucking dead,
and you wanna teach 'em tricks?
they have to be rewarded, captain.
why else will they do what we want them to do?
i don't want 'em
to do anything but drop over!
yes, well, apparently they're not inclined
to do that for you, captain.
is this your progress?
is this the shit that's supposed
to knock our socks off?
it's the beginning, yes.
it's the bare beginning of social behavior.
of civilized behavior.
civil behavior is what distinguishes us
from the lower forms.
it's what enables us
to communicate,
to go about things in an orderly fashion, 
without attacking each other like beasts.
civility must be rewarded,
captain.
if it isn't rewarded,
there's no use for it.
there's just no use
for it at all.
'possum ready?
come on. grab it.
come on.
you got it?
hey. you got it?
no!
no! no!
miller! miller!
i can't do it.
i can't do it!
i can't do it.
don't let this happen.
don't let this happen to me.
i don't wanna be one of them.
take me. please. take me.
i need fire.
jesus, mary and joseph!
get out of the way, lady.
no. i amputated the infected area.
i think i caught it in time.
yeah?
but what if you didn't?
if i didn't,
i'll shoot him myself.
it's the spick.
the yellow son of a bitch.
it's his fault this happened. it's his yellow fuckin' fault.
get out of the way, bitch,
or i'll go right through you with this.
we're getting to make this a habit, man... 
pointing guns at each other, you know.
we just lost two men
'cause of this motherfucker.
weli... that kinda evens
the odds between us then.
the spick's been bit, captain.
we gotta blast him.
- he's been bit!
- i got the infection in time.
that's bullshit, lady.
i seen a thousand of 'em.
he's gonna die.
if he dies,
i'll destroy him myself.
unless he gets you first.
you may still want to sleep
with him.
i don't want him
inside the complex.
we'll keep him out here,
with us.
we gotta blast him, captain.
that'd be doin' 'im a favor,
steel.
you think he wants
to walk around after he's dead?
you think he wants to be
one of those things?
think about it, lady.
and think about this,
all of ya...
from now on, you ain't gettin' shit
from me and my men.
tomorrow morning, we're going inside that corral,
and we ain't comin' out...
... till every one of those rotten piles 
of garbage has been wasted.
come on, steel.
get out of there, steel!
we got better things to do!
you're on my shit list, flyboy.
thank you.
let's take him inside, clean him up.
think you can move him?
i-i think so.
it's all right.
it's okay.
shh, shh, shh.
shh, shh.
- it's a man's sweater. try it on.
- thanks.
i have to go to the lab.
he's going to need
some morphine...
along with some other supplies.
i'd better go along. i'm sure those boys 
haven't calmed themselves down yet.
i'm sorry i said
those things about you.
i'm sorry too. really.
well, what do you know?
we are heroes after all.
what a relief.
sarah.
he might not make it, you know.
i know it.
at least we gave him a chance.
i'll keep an eye on him.
hey.
you guys be careful. you're not back in half an hour,
i'm coming out to look for you.
they'll leave us alone.
half an hour.
we'll be back.
jesus god almighty.
the resident surgeon has been 
burning the midnight oils.
what the hell has he been doin' down here ?
slaughtering cattle?
in his mind, that's probably
not far from the truth.
grandfather's talking.
his mind's talking.
there. i've put it away. i've put it away, mother.
i've put it away.
- bastard. be civilized!
be civil.
christ! take that off.
take that off! take that off!
five minutes, mother.
just five minutes.
oh, my god.
oh, my god.
no, sarah! don't!
it'll just bring out
rhodes and the men.
leave it be, leave it be.
let's go.
let's get outta here.
i'm beginning to think we should take
that helicopter before somebody else does.
hello, bub.
mother is very proud of you.
very, very proud indeed.
you did quite nicely today.
i don't believe it.
logan's star pupil.
- now, tomorrow, we can play
with these things again.
now it's time for your reward.
i brought you something good.
what is that?
is that...
it can't be.
oh, god. i can't look.
can't...
good night, bub.
- what are you givin' him in there, frankenstein?
- what?
- huuh!
- what is it, huh?
what do you give him?
scum!
no, you... you must listen to me,
captain. you must listen.
listen to this.
hold it, fisher.
torrez, get his gun.
take all the guns.
all of 'em.
all their fucking guns!
take all their guns.
all their guns!
those are my men in there.
my men.
those are my men in there!
hold it right there.
frankenstein's dead.
this scum gets it next unless 
you throw your weapons out right now.
he means it, johnny.
he killed logan in cold blood.
i killed logan
because he was a butcher.
i'll kill the rest of them one at a time, unless 
you get your black ass out here, flyboy.
- let him go, rhodes.
- torrez, get his machete.
we're gettin' outta here
right now.
you give me any shit about it,
i blow his head off.
whirlybird can't hold us all.
"us all" ain't going.
me, my men, you. that's it.
you'll never get me to do that,
rhodes.
no!
hey!
rickles, open the gates.
steel, shove 'em in there.
have a nice visit
with mcdermott, huh?
rhodes...
don't do this, please.
gonna give us a ride, flyboy?
i'll do whatever you say, man.
let her go now.
rhodes. let 'em off.
i'll take you...
wherever you want to go.
like you said,
chopper can't hold us all.
rhodes, don't do it.
you do it, and i won't fly.
i swear, you got to kill me
before i fly.
let 'em out.
that's the deal.
i make the deals around here,
not you.
now you get your shit together,
whatever you need.
isn't there
an old silo back there?
no. we can't go back there
without guns.
- we can't stay here. they'll tear us apart.
- oh, jesus, mary and joseph.
don't shoot 'im!
we need his ass.
steel, kick him around
a little bit.
might knock some sense
into that jungle-bunny head.
- captain!
- that's it.
run, you fuckin' lunatics.
oh!
uuh!
they're gone, flyboy.
let's go.
not a chance.
- jesus christ. that's the elevator.
- check it out.
aw, jesus.
rock slide.
we can't get through.
this way.
we can try and get around.
aah!
oh, it's you.
this way.
let's go, torrez. get up.
uuh!
aw, shit!
somebody took this apart.
the only other control's up on the platform
with a hand box.
stuck.
- rickles, we can't get out of here.
- fix it. can't you fix it?
- it's that fuckin' spick that did this!
- fix it!
- come on, man!
- fix what?
- fix the box, man! come on! fix it!
- they tore the guts out!
- i can't fix it!

he ripped these controls out,
the little yellow bastard.

holy shit.
holy fuckin' shit.
rhodes!
rhodes, you bastard!
oh, shit!
aah! shit!

you son of a bitch!
rhodes!

bag of shit.

i'll teach you how to shoot.
come on, you bag of...
oh!
let's go. follow the red lights.
- it's temporarily out of service.
- the ladder! go ahead. up, up.

to fly us to the promised land.
