just to show you how easy this money is, i'm certain

so, go ahead and make some noise,
but i don't know... why he doin' this...
the butcher of slygo.
<i>i want a clean fight.

<i>come on.</i>
i'm gonna make my favorite...
pasta putanesca.
come, let me show you my favorite part
of the house.
you must have powerful enemies?
he's clear.
you have a statue of guan yu in there.
<i>the god of war.</i>
war is a passionate undertaking
of strategy and will.
just like sex.
so, it belongs beside the bed.
the war has been declared.
<i>and now my favorite part.</i>
unconditional surrender.
<i>take off your stockings and give them to me.</i>
<i>do you like it?</i>
oh, yes.
yeah.
<i>tell me again.</i>
oh! i like it.
no.
i can't have that.
no, no, no, no.
<i>- sorry about that, chief, what's going on?
- we got ourselves a four roses.</i>
<i>four roses? where?</i>
- 414 lake shore drive.
- that's high end.
<i>look, i'm giving this one to you
and tommy kane. high profile.</i>
hey, alex, you're gonna wanna
prepare yourself for this one.
a woman was tortured to death.
you understand.
hold it tight, let's see who it is.
it's alex.
i gotta take this.
come on, tommy, answer the phone.
hey, man, what... what's
goin' on? what do we got?
we got four roses with a torture tracer, man.
where are you?
yeah. no. i'm a... i'm at a
card game, and i'm ahead.
<i>you're playing cards and you're ahead?</i>
before you lose, chip-out and tell me
where to pick you up.
yeah, well, you can get me
at the corner saint albin and mac.
<i>i'll see you in a little bit.</i>
right.
i think we got a multiple, i gotta go.
- okay. you worried?
- no. why?
you're puttin' on your pants kind of angry.
- wow, i'm that much of an open book, huh?
- to me you are.
<i>what do you think i am to him?</i>
we've been best friends since we were little kids,
and now i'm lyin' to him and he knows it.
we've been careful.
careful? what do you think? we can fool him?
this is the guy who can tell you'd had
scrambled eggs breakfast at 100 yards.
besides, i don't like lying to him.
then let's come clean,
tell him what he already knows.
that would not be good
for your future... your career.
i know.
but i'm good at my job.
- and alex knows that.
- yeah, alex also knows the rules.
and this... what we're doing...
- this is not supposed to be, babe.
- but it is.
- and we're here.
- and it's only been two months.
all right, now, listen to me, we gotta give this
a little bit of time to make sure that this is real.
and if it is...
we got some tough decisions ahead of us.
look at you, you're just the kinda guy
my father told me to avoid like the plague.
looking at you and i hate to see
you go in the middle of the night.
someday you'll be looking at me...
dunkin' my donuts, slurpin' my coffee,
- and you'll beg to get rid of me.
- the easy irish charm. save it.
i was thinkin' on my way over
here, man, you know how much you've
changed since junior high school?
since junior high? take a wild guess!
hey, look, i know what
you're talking about
and i don't want you worry, all
right? it's just a thing, okay?
don't tell me not to worry about it.
briana was a thing,
skyler, that was a thing, this is
monica, that is not a thing, man,
that is dangerous. i'm tellin,
you, i'm not kiddin', man.
- look! it's not that simple, all right?
- how you gonna say that to me?
it's not that simple, i mean
i have real feelings for her.
it might be, ya know,
maybe i'm in love with her.
let me simplify it for you in case
you don't understand me, all right?
you and her, that jeopardizes our team, that
jeopardizes me, that jeopardizes you, my family.
i'm not willin' to take that
risk, my friend, so...
you need to end it, or somebody
needs to leave.. cool it.
all right, all right, i'll go.
- you... you'll... you'll go?!
- what's gotten into you do today?
there's gotta be something more
on your mind than my sex life?
i'm takin' a job with the fbi, man.
what! really?
i'm gonna do it, it's a... it's my psych degree
means more pay, they've been callin' a lot, and...
these are by δθστθp⌠ß⌠θ which is greek to me.
and i get to spend more time
with maria and the three kids, so...
you know me, do it.
whoa! wait a second! back up
a sec, did you say three kids.
- don't tell me...
- the detective is on duty, yes, sir!
number three, buddy,
and i'm very happy about it.
that is great news, man!
congratulations, congratulations.
however, a desk job with the fbi,
terrible news. you know you can't take that job.
tommy, i love you, man, i mean, you
know i do, from the bottom of my heart.
well, you do, that's what i'm saying.
but i'd rather take advice
from a ham sandwich.
oh, my god, now you're really insulting me.
all right, well, let me explain something to you.
you don't play the game,
the game plays you.
listen, my mind's made up,
it's done, it's happening, okay?
and you've already discussed
this with maria, i suppose.
i knew it. i knew it.
well, after you discuss it with maria...
then your mind is made up.
- hi, green, how you doin', man?
- fine, sir.
good morning, chief, you're up bright and early.
yep! i got a prayer breakfast over
at the amy zion baptist church in
lafayette park.
it's one of my outreach programs.
you guys... get all this, yes?
- yeah, sure.
- good.
crimes in neighborhoods like this are... ah, hell,
cake eaters don't like it and it's bad for business.
solve it, please.
- he's runnin'.
- no doubt.
this place is heavy, huh?
hey, guys, whaddya say ya clear out,
let gandalf and i have this site.
- gandalf?
- yeah! he was a wizard, what do ya want me to say?
- gandalf.
- oh, man, we got another one, huh?
whatdya think, this is some kind of gang hit?
gotta be at least two or
three guys to pull this off.
no.
- this is one guy.
- one guy did all three? no shot.
one.
- you care to enlighten the muggles, my friend?
- that's two different movies, tom.
<i>jesus, these guys were sick.</i>
- it's one guy.
- one guy.
all right, i got a license here.
it reads: fan yau lee.
looks like maybe she's got eight grand in cash.
the only other item is this very elegant,
but blank swipe card.
yeah, footprints on the glass. that was
a laptop. he must've made off with it.
- maybe he came for.
- i don't know, i'm just...
i don't see how one guy coulda done all this.
he knew her.
tied her up, gonna have sex,
then it goes bad, she doesn't scream or
the bodyguards woulda come running in, so...
he must've drugged her
with some sort of date-rape drug.
i'll run a blood-tox, but
answer me this, all right?
how does he get a gun up
here past the bodyguards?
<i>no doubt they gave him a pat-down
before they left him alone with her.</i>
yeah, you would think.
but, uh...
the entry wounds downstairs are .380s,
or looked like it.
<i>small gun, woman's model.</i>
so, here's what happened.
our guy comes here, we got
<i>manicure-man here, hits him, bam!</i>
<i>he got the shot, he hits him twice.</i>
tough shot, but if it is one guy,
we're probably talking about a professional.
a real professional, 'cause
our asian guy comes runnin' through the door...
<i>so he leaves him to crawl while he goes
to his car, gets his tools, comes back,</i>
<i>and he lays a rose right on him,</i>
and he heads upstairs for the encore.
i'm going to ask you a question.
and you are going to get...
nine chances to get it right.
<i>it hurts, doesn't it?</i>
personally, i'm... i'm fascinated by pain.
but i can make it stop.
your laptop, tell me what the password is.
<i>he would've needed a password, i get that.</i>
there is no way it takes all ten fingers.
the other nine were for fun.
so, he sat here, cuts her fingers
off and he sits here.
<i>he's drawing.</i>
<i>take a look at this.</i>
our killer thinks he's a picasso.
<i>charcoal.
that had to take a while.</i>
all right, well, i'll have the lab check it out,
maybe he used some kind of unique type.
yeah, he's got some formal
training, too, he's pretty good.
all right, we'll follow that as well.
<i>whoa!</i>
- that's four times our salary, buddy, right there.
- if she's got that, there's more.
- safe.
- there is a safe.
whatdya got?
<i>looks like some kind of thumb reader.</i>
- are you thinking what i'm thinkin'?
- i'm always thinkin' what you're thinkin'.
- all right, man, well, i'll let you have the honor.
- no, go ahead.
no, no, you got it. you're...
- you do it.
- no, no, i'm good.
- it's on you.
- no, tom, it's totally cool.
- luck of the irish, you're doin' it.
- c'mon, you're the doctor.
well, here we go.
jackpot!
<i>clever girl.
she had a backup hard drive.</i>
looks like picasso didn't think of everything.
ya know, just once, i would like
it if you got something wrong,
'cause this is really
starting to get annoying.
- here's the copy you asked for.
- thanks.
<i>i've got some background on
fan yau. there's not much here.</i>
talk to me, what is it?
family here but i'm still looking into that.
she attends fudan university
in shanghai, where she earns her m.b.a.
these are by δθστθp⌠ß⌠θ which is greek to me.
then she wins a rhodes scholarship to oxford,
but drops out after three months. that's where
the trail dries up. nada for the last five years.
okay, if you think about the house, the jewelry,
and the cars, that money had to come from somewhere,
so odds are there is
a dude in the picture.
dude? is that your only idea
for how a woman can get money?
<i>well, the easiest way for a woman
who looks like this, all right.</i>
<i>and we're not just talkin' money,
we're talkin' crazy, big money.</i>
stay on track, guys!
what's the coroner sayin'?
cause of death was shock,
plain and simple.
her heart just stopped.
<i>but this is interesting.
there was a hypo</i>
injection mark
in her neck.
blood toxicology report's not in yet, of course.
of course, they're always behind
on... have them rush it, okay?
i think that's important. what
do you guys got back there?
the ide was routed to the bios in a weird way
and the cylinder sector, it was stored in cmos.
yo, yo, yo! geico caveman, what do you say
we break that down in english.
we splunked her email account, most of
her emails came with two names.
- gilles mercier and erich nunemacher.
- mercier, wow, that's hard to cotton.
<i>- this guy's on the forbes' richest list.
- here it is.</i>
<i>malthus corporation. they're based here
in detroit, in the aqua building.</i>
<i>like i said, crazy, big money.</i>
<i>- yeah.
- right.</i>
wait a minute! did you say erich nunemacher,
was that it? erich nunemacher?
<i>yeah.</i>
we got a e, we got an n here. this guy just
gave us his next target, guys. let's get over there.
moni, you ride with us. kleb call ahead
and let 'em know we're coming, all right?
i'm on it!
- we're here to see erich nunemacher.
- i'm sorry, detectives, but
as i already told some woman in the office,
without a warrant this as far as you go.
<i>tell me what this is about and
i will relay it in the morning.</i>
he is a target, he will be dead by morning.
i assure you, detective, a
killer would not be getting
any further than you have. we
are all former german police.
this company is our responsibility.
- has that ever happened before?
- no.
- he's already in the building! move!
- follow me!
i need this weapon.
what is this?
mr. nunemacher, we have reason to
believe your life may be in danger.
- so, we need you to move, sir.
- nonsense, this building is impenetrable.
tell them, sacks. and you, please, sterilize
your hands before you touch my furniture.
yes, sir.
hans, with me!
cover this guy, i'm walkin' the circuit.
is there a door to this office that i'm not seein'?
you idiot, this whole floor
is my office.
look, unless you want to get your ass
shot off, i suggest you take a seat, all right?
- don't touch me, you have dirty hands.
- sit down... sir.
- i'm not now an amateur.
- what in the hell do you think you're doing?
listen to me i want this damn door opened
right now, now open it!
i can't! once it's down it can
only be opened by outside security.
well, then you better figure out another way.
get someone up here
who can open this thing.
don't you listen, fool, huh?
once it's down, we can do nothing.
<i>let me see your hands.</i>
let me see your hands.
<i>put down the gun.</i>
<i>put down the weapon now!
do it now!</i>
is this what you want to die doing?
drop the gun!
<i>do it now.</i>
now put your hands behind your back.
<i>put your hands behind your back</i>
do it now!
now you're gonna open this god
damned door or i'm gonna you myself.
all right, all right! go out!
i hope you get killed! you idiot!
- you okay?
- yeah.
- look at me. you okay?
- yeah.
i think i clipped him.
he's gone.
- you okay?
- yeah.
you don't even see it!
you think you know.
no, the eyes are deeper
set than that, the bridge
of the nose is much stronger,
so it makes it more pronounced.
yeah, and he's older than that, he's gonna
have crow’s feet around the eyes.
ladies and gentlemen, that could
have gone one helluva a lot worse than it did.
alex, excellent effort! you and your team
got close and that is not enough.
yeah! but not close
enough. we were right there,
we almost had him. i almost
had him, i had the shot.
there's blood in the bathroom
so at least we have dna.
fair enough.
what else we got?
kleb?
the charcoal pencil's unremarkable,
same with the paper.
sold every day, everywhere, so...
<i>the drawing gets us nothing.</i>
witnesses.
witnesses? this is detroit.
nobody's sayin' anything.
i just spoke with nunemacher.
he and mercier are on lock-down at the house.
with our patrol officers and mercier's security
detail. we're more than welcome to stop by.
i met mercier, he's a good guy.
he's a french guy, he's very... majestic.
raised about a gazillion dollar fund
to revitalize the city.
but here's what i don't
get... we got the rich french guy,
we got a professional
assassin, now we're takin'
multinational corporations.
what's the connection?
fan yau, cfo,
nunemacher, ceo, this...
this guy just worked his way up the food chain.
- maybe to get to mercier himself.
- it's exactly what he's doin'.
we need to get cleaned up and pay
mercier a visit early this morning, okay.
now listen to me.
i need to control this, this whole thing,
i need to stay ahead of it, and so far
you people have told me exactly bupkis.
<i>now, god damn it, what do
we know about the killer?</i>
chief, you have gotta give my team a break.
this guy's a assassin.
and there's no clear cut profile for him.
<i>i can tell you what i know.</i>
he's ex-military.
somebody’s. i don't know who.
but he feels rouge. stimulus seeking,
sociopathic narcissist.
trying to make somebody hurt.
wants somebody to pay.
wants 'em to suffer.
i don't know who.
maybe his mother,
his father, himself.
the world.
who... who... who the hell knows.
<i>i think we should go with...</i>
we got a good look at this lunatic,
which means he also got a good look at us.
any shot at all we go on his list?
no, it's not his m.o.
this guy, i'm telling ya, he's focusing, and...
fan yau, $500,000 dollars in jewelry?
he didn't even breath on it. he's focused.
he's got a clear path,
he's checkin' off the list.
<i>he won't deviate.</i>
i'll tell you what.
we're going to go with: a sociopathic
killer with a narrow focus.
i think that'll comfort the citizens.
<i>- this is quite the spread.
- yeah, i'd say so.</i>
<i>hi.</i>
hi. hi. i'm peramita megawatti.
mr. mercier's assistant, and...
he's expecting you so, please...
take a seat and i'll tell him you're here.
can i offer you something, 'cause
we have everything?
you like to eat? 'cause i could make some
coffee 'cause i could use some coffee, so...
i'm good.
<i>nothing to eat, coffee?</i>
no, we had mcdonalds.
that's funny.
- that's gotta be some strong coffee they're servin'.
- that ain't coffee. did you see her eyes?
- that chick is coked to the gills.
- yeah, she's been out all night.
c'mon! no woman wears that
get-up at eight in the morning.
i remember your undercover work.
- that was a very special occasion.
- gentlemen, it's good to see you.
under calmer circumstances.
i was going to say the same to you.
ah, detective ash.
i wasn't expecting you.
it was very sexy to be saved
by a beautiful woman.
with a line like that i should
have let him kill you. i'm kidding.
detective, dr. cross,
gilles mercier.
oh, i'm so sorry. my ring.
my only vanity, 14 carat.
it was given to me by the king of cambodia.
thank you all for your courage on eric's behalf,
he and cloche are both like family to me.
working for you seems to be pretty
dangerous these days, yeah?
may i speak with you alone, dr. cross?
<i>malthus corporation presents
a new vision for detroit.</i>
<i>what do you think?</i>
are you like everyone else, dr. cross?
do you see around you only death and decay?
sir, you don't want to ask
me that question, i'm a cop.
this city will be born once again.
a global center
of manufacturing and innovation.
but this time hydrogen engines, nano-technology.
thorium mini-reactors, the future.
mr. mercier, you and i, we both know that your
employees, they're not the target, you are.
have any idea why?
you have done your homework.
please sit down.
- you know, there are many reasons why.
- i understand that, sir, i am not here to judge you.
i'm just looking for leads.
whoever killed poor fan yau
tries to kill erich last night, yes...
- i am quite sure his ultimate target is me.
- have any idea who he may be?
i don't have the slightest idea.
but...
i don't want to die.
forgive me.
the pressure has been immense.
- do you like nature, dr. cross?
- human nature.
- some cognac?
- no.
- oh, yes, your duty. but this is louis thirteen.
- mr. mercier, can we stick to the point here?
you must find it unpalatable being
sworn to protect a man like me.
- someone rich and spoiled.
- don't over think it.
i'm just lookin' for a bad guy.
you know, if you had not called me,
i would have called you.
of course you would have, to have me
drive out here an hour to tell me nothing?
no. so i could see with my own eyes,
if you were up to the task of finding the killer.
if i wasn't up to the task, sir, then your
nunemacher wouldn't be alive now, would he?
no, i think you a very good detective, dr. cross.
make no mistake about it, i think
you are the man i hoped you would be.
if i think of anything else,
i will get in touch.
i have another appointment now, so,
you'll have to excuse me.
cloche, please, show detective
dr. cross to his car.
it's been a long time since we've
been out without a kid between us.
yeah, right.
and here we are with this freeloader.
i'm not paying for his dinner tonight.
i want you to know he's gotta get a job.
- yeah, like his daddy,
- yes.
who has two, right?
it's fbi profiling, 35 percent more money.
great health benefits,
great dental,
regular hours, not as
unpredictable as these.
come on, babe, i think
d.c.'d be a good thing.
yeah, i know, i get it, i get it. that...
here's the other side...
yeah.
i have a career, too, and
it is right here in detroit.
i know that.
the kids like their schools, and i have no idea
what the public school system is like in d.c.
and... how you gonna convince
nana mama to leave detroit?
the national guard and a drink.
oh, honey, come on, these are
the questions that have to be
answered before we can just
put up the for sale sign.
- i understand that, honey, i do.
- we're gonna work through this together.
all right? together!
let's toast to that, come on.
it's bad luck to toast with water, honey.
we don't wanna do that.
- it's superstition, come on, come on..
- all right! fine. toast! to the freeloader.
don't you dare answer that.
baby, if i was fbi profiling,
then maybe i wouldn't have to.
- we're not done here, mister, not by a long shot.
- i know, i know, fine, hold on just a second.
monica this better be damn good.
monica?
<i>this isn't monica.</i>
<i>do you know who this is?</i>
<i>- yes.
- are you surprised to hear from me?</i>
what do you want?
<i>to send you something.</i>
<i>it's coming to you now.</i>
<i>there are so many interesting
things you can do with</i>
fire, and water.
<i>dr. cross, are you there?</i>
come on now!
<i>you can do better than that.
this is your only chance to psychoanalyze me.</i>
<i>why don't you ask me some questions?</i>
<i>i want you to ask me some questions.</i>
are you having fun?
<i>fun? am i having fun?
yeah, yes, i suppose i am.</i>
<i>but i think you'd find my hobby boring.</i>
so your hobby is inflicting pain?
<i>oh! no, no, that's... that's not just a hobby.</i>
<i>inflicting pain is an crucial
part of my true calling.</i>
so it fascinates you?
but in the beginning i'm sure it was
very hard to deal with the guilt.
<i>so where did it start? was it a
neighbor's pet? or was it your own?</i>
you're being disrespectful, very disrespectful,
and i don't like that, not... not at all.
i'm a professional.
<i>well, we're just two professionals
havin' a conversation, right?</i>
señora cross, your table is ready.
follow me please.
i don't consider you a professional.
you are not a professional.
<i>why not? what do you call that
little run-in last night, huh?</i>
ah, yes, yes, you did figure out my embedded
clue in the drawing. that's true,
i suppose i have give you
some credit for that. but...
monica, under duress, told me that
the rest was just lucky timing.
<i>she can handle some pain, that one.</i>
you're one, sick, twisted sonofabitch,
do you know that?
dr. cross, you're taking this personally.
yeah, about as personal
as you took running out
of that building with your
tail tucked between your legs.
<i>that job i can finish on another day.</i>
i bet failing has to be
difficult for a guy like you.
<i>so, how did you punish yourself?
was it wire under your fingernails?</i>
<i>was it zapping your testicles
with a stun gun? did you...</i>
textbook psychology, dr. cross.
<i>seriously.
textbook.</i>
<i>and besides, how could i ever believe you
when you're wearing that... that blue, floral tie?</i>
<i>by the way, you have a very pretty wife.
sitting there...</i>
<i>deciding she's going to have some green tea.</i>
she looks stunning.
- okay, okay, honey, hey...
- the baby.
i need... i need somebody
to call 911 for me, please.
ya hear me, call 911! call 911!
baby! baby, look at me.
no, no, no, no, no, no, you're okay, okay.
<i>look! honey! hi! look! look!</i>
i got it wrong, man.
i got it wrong and look what happened.
thanks.
whatchya got, tommy?
it was just the lab, they found
trace elements of this drug
this sonofabitch is using.
it's got a 24 hour half-life.
it's called ttx, tetra something-or-other.
that means he's getting it right here locally.
somebody knows this guy.
somebody's puttin' it in his hands.
well, here's the thing, man, it paralyzes
the victim but leaves them totally aware.
which means that she was awake, man.
she... she... couldn't do anything...
but she could feel everything
that was happening to her.
we gotta find this guy
and we gotta take him out!
i need you to calm down, man,
you gotta stay with me, you can't fall apart on...
you don't understand, man!
please, tommy, please. we
gotta get this sonofabitch, okay?
<i>excuse me.</i>
janelle's up.. up in her room crying.
she's alone.
she needs you, son.
honey.
babe, listen, you can't sit up here all alone.
we're all worried about you down there.
none of us is gonna get through this alone, okay?
- i want my mom back, i want her back.
- i know.
i want her back, too, honey.
you know, before you were born...
your mom made me buy this piano.
i hate the piano, i hate that thing,
i hate everything, i'm never gonna play it again.
janelle, look at me, honey.
when i was, ah... just about your age...
my dad died.
and nana mama came up and she would say...
all the things i'm trying to say to you, honey.
but out of everything she said,
she said that... that my father loved me.
and i know your mom loved you, honey.
and she loved me and she loved your brother.
and when the person is gone,
that love just doesn't go away from 'em, it stays.
do you understand me?
it stays, okay?
so, we're gonna try to remember the love, okay?
thank you, baby.
cross.
<i>good afternoon, detective.</i>
<i>am i calling at a bad time?</i>
that depends, are you callin'
to tell me where you are,
so i can hunt you down
like a down like a rabid dog.
that's good.
i can feel that.
i mean you looked so... numb
at the funeral today.
<i>but now the pain's really
starting to flow, isn't it?</i>
here is another emotion for you...
it's pleasure.
the pleasure i'm gonna get when i watch your soul
come oozing out of your body, you maggot.
well, confucius said, "when setting off on
the path of revenge, dig two graves"
- that's fine with me, as long as you're in one of them.
- me?
why me?
i mean, you made me do it.
it's all your fault.
<i>i had you in my scope. locked!</i>
<i>then you just had to be so bright.</i>
you had to try and...
and push my buttons.
spouting all your psychobabble.
<i>i decided that death would be just
too easy on you. no, you needed to suffer.</i>
<i>really suffer. and so i
took away your wife instead.</i>
and now you're gonna take this knowledge to
the grave. if you just had kept your mouth shut...
you wouldn't be feelin' any pain at all.
i saw the way how you and tommy
were looking at each other.
i know what you're up to.
i loved her.
like she was my own daughter.
do i need to tell you this?
look at you. self-appointed,
judge, jury and executioner.
mama, either you step aside or you go
back up those stairs, but you're in my way.
you just lost your wife
but you're still here.
your soul is alive in your body.
you can't lose that, you know.
i not losing anything else.
i'm gonna deliver some justice.
liar. liar. liar!
some fool child placatin' me. you're gonna
go out there and get yourself killed.
- that's ain't gonna happen.
- so you gun him down, you do that,
you go home, you get up
the next day and then what?
i have to figure out how to live
another day without maria.
don't you walk out that door!
if you walk outta here tonight,
how you gonna walk back in?
how you gonna look your children in the eye,
what will you say to them?
i know what's going in your heart,
but you can't do this.
he won't stop.
i've seen his face.
i heard his voice.
i will always be a threat
to him, don't you understand that?
but i will meet his soul at
the gates of hell, before i let him.
take another person from me that i love.
<i>look at me.</i>
now, these men are comin' to take
you and my children to someplace safe.
go with them...
and don't you put up a fuss.
<i>hey!</i>
<i>i've got it.</i>
just where i left it.

- it's the police, sir!
- who is this?
- i think you know who it is.
it seems that i have underestimated you,
detective dr. cross.
<i>how did you find me?</i>
your only vanity.
<i>your 14 carat gold ring
from the king of cambodia.</i>
<i>you weren't wearing it
at the courthouse.</i>
<i>but we both knew it wasn't you, right?
it was cloche.</i>
<i>you sent him in there
to take the hit for you.</i>
a hit that you, no doubt,
arranged on yourself.
<i>yes?</i>
i'm at the line.
<i>the transfer is being routed.</i>
<i>you know where to find her.</i>
all of them. do you understand?
my financial problems in
germany were just the beginning.
- everything begins to unravel.
- yeah, 2008 wasn't a good year for you.
i was forced to do something drastic.
i could not go out a loser.
so you've embezzled from you detroit fund?
<i>nunemacher and fan yau, they were</i>
<i>in on it to help you escape...</i>
<i>so you had to do away with them.</i>
they were inside my information loop.
i had no choice.
<i>and this psychopath?</i>
who is he?
<i>i never knew his name.</i>
i contacted him on the open market.
he came highly recommended.
<i>you let that monster loose,</i>
you thought you could control him?
you are an arrogant bastard.
your wife was never,
never part of the equation.
<i>- i am truly sorry.
- i think you should look out of your window.</i>
<i>what is this?</i>
you have nothing on me.
- there is no extradition here.
- it's not extradition that i want.
<i>you are in the perfect place.</i>
but you have no proof, no case.
- i am clean.
- you were...
<i>but your assistant, paramita...</i>
<i>she's an addict. and i knew
it is only a matter of time...</i>
<i>before she got caught using
or selling or something.</i>
<i>she rolled over on ya.
gave you up for immunity.</i>
but i have nothing to do with the drugs.
i don't know nothing about them.
then why are there two kilos of cocaine
in the trunk next to your favorite couch?
do you have any idea what the punishment is
for drug smuggling, where you are?
- it's death by firing squad.
- you framed me with this...
- it is a lie! all dirty lies.
- my wife is dead because of you.
and soon you will be dead because of me.
no! no! no!
i think your days of underestimating
people are over, monsieur mercier.
lies! no! help me.
<i>let me go.</i>
we got him.
yeah, we got him good.
<i>you walk outta here tonight,
how you gonna walk back in?</i>
<i>how ya gonna look your children in the eye,
what will you say them?</i>
well, i guess this is it.
yeah, i guess so.
here, you can save me a stamp.
- what's this?
- my application to the fbi.
d.c.'s lookin' like
a step up right about now.
what do you think?
i think you're worryin'
about getting your ass
shot up if i'm not around
here... to watch your back.
very funny. that was actually
my concern about you.
like the time i had to step in before
charlie mcclinch kicked your ass.
and that was... right... yeah...
the first day in kindergarten... yeah.
- set the tone for our whole relationship.
- do i need to remind you of the winston brothers?
two against one, and i was holdin' my own
and you didn't show up to the very end.
i was standin' behind a tree watchin' you
get your ass kicked. i was enjoyin' it.
- thank you brother.
- no, man, thank you.
- see you in d.c., yeah?
- hell, yeah.
janelle!
the movers will be here in
a little bit, they charge by the hour.
you don't want to...
you don't want to leave behind
anything you love.
