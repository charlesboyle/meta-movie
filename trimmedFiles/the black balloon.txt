we move on to the next module
for this term,
which is the bronze medallion.
yep, some of you might actually
do something useful and
save a life one day.
okay. today we're going to be
hitting the pools for some laps.
now they've had to super-chlorinate
the pools because of the heat...
so just keep your eyes closed and
there shouldn't be too many problems.
where are your swimming trunks?
um...
i um... i've got them on, miss.
how on earth do you expect
to swim in those?
so you brought nothing appropriate
for swimming?
what's your name?
um, thomas.
thomas mollison.
yeah he's new, miss.
well, mollison, never mind.
we have contingencies for
situations like this.
check it out! check it out!
ladies and gentlemen-
the yellow dick stickers!
hey, pin dick!
he's bigger than you, bucko!
you'd be the one to know, sally!
you're just jealous!
you can all take turns wearing them
if they get you that excited!
now take your marks!
oh, shit!
get off the lane ropes, mollison!
on your marks!
watch out!
fuck, you swim like a spastic!
you're not much better, bucko!
jackie just beat you twice.
yeah.
look at you. eh?
ha-ha, you cheeky monkey!
this musical's got to be
the lamest thing i've ever heard of.
i think it's cute.
it's nice they've included charlie.
it's not cute. it's lame.
half of them can't even talk,
let alone sing.
that's not the point, thomas.
all right, now this is ready.
you just heat it up when
your brother and you are hungry
and well be back about eight.
thank you.
no beer for you, charlie. no beer.
monkeys don't drink beer.
hey, mum, with a roundabout,
do you have to pause
or can you drive straight through
if it's clear?
i think you have to stop.
you'd better ask your father.
hey, simon?
have you had a shower yet?
no!
well, hurry up!
rex said i don't need one.
oh, shit.
can you go and talk to rex for me?
go on, thomas.
please.
dad, come on.
it's not me. it's rex.
mum, dad still won't get into the shower.
bloody hell!
rex, why can't simon have a shower?
well, rex reckons because you're
the one giving the talk that
you should go to the meeting...
and i'll stay home and
look after the boys.
oh, but rex,
i think some of the husbands
might be interested in simon's
viewpoint on sex and pregnancy.
no, they wouldn't.
yes, they would.
all right, well rex also reckons that
if i come to the meeting...
i should get some...
how did you put it again, mate?
oh yeah, special attention tonight.
ah, see but rex,
simon gets nothing but
special attention from me.
that's why i'm out here. hop to it.
charlie?
she's already on
two bloody committees.
it's okay. i've just got to
take it easy for a while.
you bloody won't just take it easy.

hey, jackie. um...
sorry i took so long.
it sounded like you were having
a party or something.
ah, no, it's just um...
it's mum. she's just pregnant.
she makes a lot of noise and stuff.
is your dad in the army?
yeah. yeah, he is.
did you have to move around a lot?
well... three primary schools.
this is my second high school. so...
you must miss your friends.

hey, something a bit weird
happened to me this morning.
while i was in the shower,
two boys broke into my house
in their undies.
they used to toilet.
and they left these...
see, it has "c. mollison" on it,
right there.
um... you know, that's not weird.
i've actually, um, i've heard of people
who um, they dress as monkeys and...
and they break into people's houses, you know,
and they use the toilet or something.
oh. well yeah, it was me.
chimp mollison, my alias. oo-ee-ah!
it was exactly like that.
you just have to be in your undies
to get it right.
well, i'm just gonna have to
get to the bottom of this.
i can see through shampoo you know.
thomas patrick mollison!!!!
it's not like i ask for much.
look at you, you little shit!
no, charlie. bad! bad!
you don't rub poo on the carpet!
don't! keep your hand out of it!
arms up! arms up!
for godssake!
stop that! ugh! don't touch me!
i don't know what's got into you,
thomas.
you deal with it. you deal with it.
come on, charlie.
do you want these back?
don't you dare touch anything, charlie!
charlie, no! keep your hands up! up!
mum. it was an accident.
honestly?
i wish you'd grow up a bit.
you're going to be sixteen soon.
now you watch your brother.
oh, charlie. piss off.
mum. stop. you're supposed to
be in bed. okay?
no, it's too late for that.
can't leave you to do anything, can i?
he shat everywhere! yell at him!
well, what was he supposed to do?
don't be so bloody selfish, thomas!
he's not my responsibility!
he's your brother!
he's a freak!
i don't want anything to do with him.
your brother will never be able to
do the things you can, thomas.
he'll never get a job or have a family.
he'll never be able to look after himself.
he will live with us
for the rest of his life.
so if there's anything...
that your father...
and i can do to help make your father,
your brother's life... a little happier...
mum. mum, stop. stop.

dad?
yep?
do you ever wish charlie was normal?
yeah, at the start.
i don't think about it much
any more though.
charlie's charlie.
yeah, but don't you think it's kind
of unfair?
your mum reckons we got charlie
because we're capable...
we're strong enough to deal with him.
do you believe that?
i don't know.
your mum is, that's for sure.
all i know is, he's my own.
and you're weak as piss if
you don't look after you own.
hey, charlie. what do you want for tea?
hey, what's this?
new wheels for your mother.
oh, come on. give us a go.
maybe when you get your licence.
what's in the bag?
it's a surprise.

you're meant to be saving her,
not drowning her.
nice and easy. forty-five seconds.
come on!
are you all right?
one-two-three-four-five-six-seven...
fourteen-fifteen.
one-two-three-four-five-six-seven...
fourteen-fifteen.
everyone waving!
your mum reckons you need more than
one pan to make dinner.
but boys, that's just not true.
good, charlie?
actually, i might go and visit your mother
after dinner
if you boys are all right by yourselves.
dad, would you be able to take me
for a driving lesson later on?
in the valiant?
son, shit in one hand and a wish in the other
and see which one gets full fastest!
hi. i'm janet and this is trevor

- da!
he says it's his hood.
so why aren't there any trees in here?
ah, that would be because it's a rifle range.
bullshit!
wow-ee!
who says "wow-ee"?
i do!
pretty, don't you think?
no, not really.
you're supposed to say,
"not as pretty as you."
well, they make me sneeze.
besides they're noxious weeds.
i don't care. they're beautiful.
they strangle the native plants
and probably poison all the native animals.
what native animals?
exactly.
i like them. do you like them, charlie?
see? me and charlie like them.
and so do the beeezzz.
so you're a loner on this one!
no, no! i will fall!
fraidy cat! fraidy cat! yes you are.
ah-ha-ha!
you show off!
dem are fighting words.
i dare you to come over here and say dem.
come on.
coming...
i shall take it upon myself, boy,
to instruct you in the art of swimming.
since when was swimming an art?
well, it's all about technique.
here...
when you raise your elbow up,
that's when you breathe...
...and then you've got to push your
arm through the water like this.
huh?
okay.
go on. give it a whirl.
kieren perkins watch out!
shit!
charlie? charlie!
charlie. charlie, it's okay.
just hold on. it's all right.
come on, charlie.
i'm knackered.
are you cold?
don't know.
here...
it's beautiful.
thank you.
you're welcome.
close your eyes.
okay.
what do you see?
but my eyes are closed.
yeah, but what do you see?
black?
look harder.
okay,
i can see these little speckles of light...
...they're blue and red, like,
floating around like a lava lamp.
that should go away.
it's going.
it's gone.
now it's black.
hold on, no, it's mainly black. but...
it's kind of fuzzy. like...
...like snow on t.v.
it doesn't go away.
you can wait an hour or a year... but
it'll still be all fuzzy.
i reckon if it went away, i'd be
able to see my mum.
that's what it's like for my brother.
it's not just what he can see.
it's what he hears and what he thinks.
everything.
i think it's all fuzzy.
well i guess we're not going to
scouts tonight.
it could be worse.
thank you.
my dad's going to be home soon.
oh, okay, that's fine.
what?
stop it!
um... well, it's my birthday next week.
and...
well, my family usually do
this dinner type thing.
do you want to come?
yes, hold on...
what?
shut up!!
maggie! sophie needs her nappy changed!
there's nothing stopping you!
it's gone everywhere!
it's up her back and everything!
a bit of poo's not going to hurt you!
i'm dressed for work, maggie. i can't!
bloody hell!
boys, watch this. are you ready? okay...
come on. get'em out. good girl.
yes!
look, thomas. it's the spastic bus!
they've come to pick you up! get on!
bucko's just
saying goodbye to his girlfriend!
oh yeah. no she's your woman, mate.
good morning.
charlie!
hey! the retard's after you!
do you know him, jackie?
what are you doing?
get back on the bus!
no. now, charlie.
it's a spastic!
- charlie, where's the bus?
i think it's his brother.
charlie, please.
charlie...
charlie, please.
you have to get back on the bus.
charlie!
charlie!
thomas's brother's freaking out!
i'm going to get some help.
charlie! i'll buy you an ice cream!
do you want an ice cream, charlie?
stop!
charlie! charlie!
what's going on here? back it up!
back it up! what's going on?
mate, are you all right?
stop that! leave him alone!
leave him! leave him!
you're making it worse!
it's all right! it's all right!
leave him be, all right?
get away!
charlie...
class! stand back, class!
they're all going in.
come on! shoo!
it's all right, charlie... it's okay.
look, we've got your bag;
we've got your monkey ears. yeah?
good boy. good boy. good boy.
we'll go back to the bus. okay?
good boy.
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,
we're off on our way...
the sky and sea together,
you and me every day...
there you are.
i was going to give this to you later,
but i couldn't wait.
happy birthday.
thanks.
i recorded everything especially for you.
go on, play it.
well you can have my heart, have my soul
without you i feel cold.
won't you come with me
and i will make you happy
and then when i'm alone,
i'll dream of you'til the day is done.
don't you know i will be dying
to be by your side...
listen, i know you're upset.
just don't worry what
those stupid kids at school think.
yeah, well it's easy for you to say that.
you have to stop wishing
charlie was normal.
he's never going to change.
howwwazzziiiiitttt?!!
come on-nnnnnnnnn!!!
wassiiiiiiiiitttttt?!
oh, come on, maggie. it was plumb!
yes! i'll retire when i get my century,
mr. mollison, so then you can get a bat!
you'll keep.
this is so yum, mrs. mollison.
i can't remember the last time i had a roast.
oh, really?
we have a roast once a fortnight.
simon just loves his roast vegies,
don't you darls?
my dad doesn't really cook.
and we eat at different times,
so it's just take away really.
you're welcome over here
for dinner anytime.
yeah, just as long as you do the dishes!
what is it, sweetie?
here, pass it to mummy.
i can do it.
sure?
- yeah.
you're being very good.
he'll do any thing for a pretty girl.
won't you, mate?
what do you say?
that's right. good boy.
do you think charlie will ever talk again?
yes.
probably not, actually.
we hoped he might have when
he hit adolescence but...
unfortunately he didn't.
but you get your point across,
don't you sweetie?
yeah, well maybe if we stopped signing,
he'd start talking, mum.
i think that's unlikely, thomas.
are you hungry, too?
she's so tiny.
yeah,
well she didn't feel so tiny coming out.
you know, i wasn't much older than
you when i had charlie.
mum?!
well, she's hungry.
i fed you this way.
you loved it! couldn't get enough!
please...
for he's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly good fell-ow
and so say all of us!
no, charlie! you wait for thomas
and then we'll light them again.
go, tommy.
i'm sorry, sweetie.
charlie! come here to mummy.
i said wait! come here.
just hold on, tommy. i've got that.
just wait. wait, mate.
no.
okay, almost there. okay...
righto. one for the camera.
hip hip! ...hooray!
how about one of those over here,
simon, leave the poor girl alone.
yeah.
um, tommy, now i know we've already
given you your gift,
but i reckon you might like this one.
oh, what could this be?
thank you!
you're officially allowed on the road now.
rex reckons if
i can teach your mother to drive,
i can teach anyone.
all right. who want some cake?
yes please!
this is thomas's favourite, isn't it, sweetie?
it is, mama.
all right, i'll get the ice-cream.
simon, you can start cutting the cake.
yep. all right.
four tiny little pieces for the family,
and one big piece for me.
oh, my god!
charlie... charlie, shit, charlie!
come on, charlie, you know that's private!
you do that in your bedroom!
put your dick back in your shorts, mate!
bad, charlie, bad! no. bad!
don't laugh!
i'm so sorry, jackie.
how many times
do we have to tell you that?
you say sorry to jackie, and go and wash
your hands. all right, mate?
thomas, don't be ridiculous.
you put that down now right now!
thomas!
charlie!
charlie! get off! charlie!

brother's better looking than you.

you'll actually get your bronze medallion.
on your marks!
okay. just ease off nice and easy,
nice and easy.
just get up to a nice cruising speed.
yep.
don't do anything sudden.
all right.
and you've got to drive like
everyone else on the road is an idiot.
no don't look at me.
look at the road.
okay. okay, okay.
just remember everyone else
on the road is an idiot.
it's called defensive driving.
defensive.
just keep an eye on the things that you
might find come running out of the driveway.
all right. or, okay. how far do?
just try not... try not to...
excellent.
you're a natural.
just like your old man.
wow-ee!
climb in, jackie.
thank you.
hopefully, tonight will be the last
time we see those bloody monkey ears.
ladies and gentlemen. roll up,
roll up, for the unbelievable, inconceivable,
"animals afloat"!
oh, it looks so cute!

in the dance with charlie.

charlie! hey!

you know charlie has worked
so hard for this, russell.
are you right? charlie, are you okay?
you've been on stage before, remember?
do it for mum and dad, okay?
look at my face.
charlie won't be able to dance
if you don't.

come on, charlie. come on.
be a good boy. come on.
come on. on stage!
there you go! beautiful!
you remember when we were little?
we used to have baths with dad,
and we'd rub soap into his legs...
...and they were so hairy they'd
always go white?
then he'd fart and we'd start clapping
and you'd go, 'poo-poo noises',
'poo-poo noises'.
i've hated being your brother.
every night i used to close my eyes
and wish that when
i woke up you'd be normal.
but you won't.
you just pissed on my leg, didn't you?
simon, have you mowed the lawn yet?
rex said i didn't need to!
i'm gonna kill that bear!
