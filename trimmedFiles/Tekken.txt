tekken - 2010
sub edit by me [npdv.id@gmail.com]
[classical score playing]
man's voice:
after the terror wars, governments fell.
corporations took control,
fighting over what remained.
[guns firing]
eight companies survived
and divided up the world.
those companies were
collectively known as iron fist.
[people cheers]
the american territories fell
to the mightiest corporation of all,
tekken.
once a year,
they hosted a tournament
which was no game,
kill or be killed.
outside the walls of tekken city,
in the burned-out slums
they call the anvil,
that's where it all started.
[crowd cheering]

[men speak japanese]
- [thunder rumbling)

- [helicopter whirring]
[rock music playing]
<i>[knocking]
# don't seem to do no good... #</i>
<i>open up. come on.
# i think i'li sort it out on my own #</i>
<i># it's your turn to listen, baby #</i>
<i># you'd better leave me alone,
gonna leave you behind... #</i>
- i told you to use the side entrance.
- i knocked, nobody answered.
you can't hear anything
over this old noise.
hey, this is real music,
not that corporate shit
they play in the city.
what was that song you were playing
last week? the roaches?
the beatles.
you see what i'm talking about?
loss of art...
the end of creative thought.
what happened to you?
- it's nothing.
- you're the only one who gets
through the gang zones.
i don't know how you do it.
- i guess i'm motivated.
- what you are, jin,
is a believer in the cause.
you just don't know it.
- i'm not a joiner, bonner.
- come on, man.
play your cards right,
one day this could all be yours.
ahh.
oh.
[chuckles]
[beeps, humming]
get some serious speed with this.
- for what?
- secret internet, new underground,
- off the tekken sub grid.
- i'm sorry i asked.
used to be you had a choice,
free market, justice system,
- now everything's tekken.
- look, would you save the speech
- until after you've paid me?
- whoa.
keep the change.
what's this, bonner?
you said global dollars.
i say a lot of things. i drink.
you said global dollars.
oh.
- we good?
- [clears throat]
now we're good.
when you gonna need another run?
don't know.
iron fist coming up.
the jackhammers are cracking down.
now you tell me.
jin, kick back.
- gotta learn how to relax.
- [laughs]
[man speaking japanese over p.a.]
man #2 over p.a.:
honor through discipline.
peace through grace.
these are the goals
demonstrated each year
at the iron fist tournament.
as reigning champion
for the past four years,
we are honored
to host the iron fist tournament
in tekken city.
strength through order.
that is tekken.
woman over p.a.: thank you for
your loyal listening and appreciation.
- [rock music playing)
- [people chattering]
announcer on tv: there are
just two nights left before the kickoff
- of the iron fist tournament.
- announcer #2: that's right.
just two days left
and the competition begins
back where it started,
here in tekken city.
- how's the iron fist action going?
- ah. too early to tell.
two-time semifinalist marshall law
didn't even make it
through the preliminary rounds
and is forced to fight in an open call
for the wild card spot.
- how's my tab?
- you're up to 350.
tapped out.
- how about now?
- ooh.
that's why
you're my favorite customer.
catch you later.
- hey.
- hey.
you got anything interesting?
everything i got is
interesting to somebody,
you know what i mean?
- how about coffee?
- coffee. [laughs]
yeah, coffee.
- that's 100 an ounce.
- jesus.
hey, man, there's none
of that freeze-fried,
stepped-on instant bullshit,
you know what i mean?
you know what
they used to call colombian?
that's what that is right there.
this is the good shit, my friend.
all right. give me one
of those oranges too.
and a bar of chocolate.
ah. business must be booming.
that'll be 200 tekken red.
how about 100 global blue?
that will work.
- nice doing business with you.
- always.
hey, jin! i haven't
seen you around, man.
- i've been busy.
- thought anymore about our offer?
- no. sorry.
- hey, just wait a minute, man.
now you're tough, man.
i used to watch you street fight.
- that was for money.
- and this is for a cause.
heihachi mishima and his
tekken gestapo treat us like slaves.
i've got my own life,
my own problems.
i told you, man.
this asshole is a waste of time.
no no, he's just another punk
who'd rather die in the anvil
than stand up like a man.
hey. hey, man.
- [helicopter buzzes)
- [drums playing]
[man shouting in japanese]
[jacks shouting in japanese]
is everything prepared?
representative fighters are en route
from their home corporations.
good good.
i'm transferring command
of the tekken jackhammers to you
for the duration of the tournament.
oh, father, i am honored.
tighten security in the anvil
and the outer sectors.
i will send additional units to patrol
for anti-corporate insurgents.
not even minor infringements
will be tolerated.
with respect,
i should've given
the speech today.
a chance to pass the torch
from father to son.
when i think you're ready.
i have been ready for years.
your job is to maintain security.
do not disappoint me.
[helicopter whirring]
woman over p.a.:
the anvil curfew begins in five minutes.
please return to your homes.
the anvil curfew begins
in five minutes.
please return to your homes.
- [door opens]
- the anvil curfew
begins in five minutes.
please return to your homes.
i remember those moves.
you should.
you were my best student.
- i was your only student, mom.
- are you hungry?
i've been rationing protein squares.
- how about an orange?
- very funny.
- coffee?
- you always talked
- about missing it so much.
- this must've cost a fortune.
i can afford it.
runs have been good.
jin, running anti-tekken contraband
will get you killed.
or i could always enter iron fist,
make some real money, huh?
you will have nothing to do
with tekken, do you understand?
i wili not have you waste your talent.
but it wouldn't be a waste.
it pays.
and what difference does it make?
who cares where
the money comes from?
i care. this is not
what i trained you for.
then what the hell
did you train me for?
do you think that life
on the other side of that wall
will bring you happiness?
trust me, it won't.
oh, here we go.
the world burned
because people had to have more.
and this is better?
rationing protein squares?
is that what my father
would've wanted for us?
- don't.
- why won't you ever talk about him?
your father is dead,
that's all you need to know.
you know what? forget it.
i'm out of here.
there's a curfew tonight.
there are jacks everywhere.
- the jacks are always everywhere.
- i am telling you not to go.
[door closes]
- jin?
- hey, hara.
come here.
- where have you been?
- i've been around.
- what is it?
- chocolate.
are you serious?
mmm. [laughs]
sounds like i've been replaced.
- bonner: are we tied in yet?
- another minute.
i'm dropping over
the last firewall here.
we'll be inside
the tekken video sub grid for 60 seconds.
we interrupt this program
to bring you the truth.
no one understands
how you're not dead.
i guess i'm lucky.
about to get lucky.
[jack shouts in japanese]
i missed you.
it wasn't easy back tracing your hack.
you were smart
to use none of tekken's hardware.
well, almost none.
[screams]
now this is an american classic.
the revolution will not be televised.
[gunshot]
[man speaks over p.a.]
[beeping]
- oh shit.
- woman over p.a.: this is
- a tekken security alert.
- the jacks!
woman: please be prepared
for search and seizure.
we've gotta separate.
you'll be fine.
[both speak japanese]
man: sir, we've located
the insurgents in sector 9.
burn everything and everyone.
man:
but, sir, our men are still in there.
hazuya:
i don't care. destroy it!
[both speak japanese]
[beeps]
ah!
[heart beating]
mother's voice: you will have
nothing to do with tekken.
do you understand?
i wili not
have you waste your talent.
hyah!
tekken?
jin.
i should've been here.
she asked me not to go.
it's not your fault.
heihachi mishima killed her.
i know how you feel.
my father was killed in a jackhammer,
and what did anyone
do about it? nothing!
what does anyone
ever do about it? nothing!
he's gonna pay
for what he has done.
[helicopter approaching]
announcer on tv: now has an unknown
ever won a spot in an open call?
announcer #2: no, it's an iron fist
tradition that heihachi mishima started
all the way back in the beginning,
and he continues it to this day.
<i>in other news, terrorist
leader bonner...</i>
man over p.a.:
contestants for open call,
please proceed to tekken east gate.
man #2:
okay, ladies and gentlemen, listen up!
so who's gonna be
the next people's choice
and the next
iron fist champion, huh?
hey, we would never win
this shit anyway.
ain't nothing but a goddamn
meat grinder to pump up the crowd.
- piss off! don't!
- hey.
we all know winter's coming,
so my guess is
you're going to need oil
to keep those kiddies from freezing.
now i've got 100 global dollars.
who can go one round
against marshall law.
one round.
woman:
got it, man?
you're a bunch of wankers...
every last one of you.
except you, white boy. inside.
man #3:
he called him out. did you see that?
- he called him out.
- last call.
going.
- going.
- wait!
[man whistles]
good going! good going!
i wanna sign up.
woman #2:
take his money.
okay. sign there.
leave the bag.
[scattered applause, cheering]
- knock yourself out.
- man: dead man walking!
- [crowd shouting, cheering)
- [grunting]
hey, they're with me.
hey, gentlemen, as you know,
this is a qualifying event.
three-minute rounds,
so please make it entertaining.
hey, big guy, you're up first.
are you scared?
- i'm fine.
- [cracks]
[crowd cheers loudly]
i'm not.
- hey, where you going?
- to hell with this.
wanker.
- [cheering continues]
- yeah! yeah!
[gate buzzes]
[man groaning]
hey, he's up next.
get him in the cage. now.
announcer on tv: here comes
another unknown contestant...
- man: hey, isn't that jin?
- ...to face marshall law.
- law is in peak physical condition.
- man: hey, everyone, it's jin.
announcer: hey, remember
last year's spectacular bout
where he knocked out paul phoenix
in 28 seconds, citizens?
[crowd chants]
fight fight fight fight fight fight!
i'm going to iron fist
and you're in my way.
you need to learn some respect.
[spits]
announcer: any way you cut it,
this kid doesn't have what it takes
- to stand up to marshall law.
- man: he's gonna be road kill.
[cheering]
- fight fight!
- [law shouts]
- announcer: oh my! off the cage!
- yes!
- announcer: what a feat of athleticism!
- crowd: fight fight fight fight fight
fight fight fight
fight fight fight fight
fight fight fight fight!
[cheering]
hyah!
[yells]
announcer #2: he had me going there.
i thought he had a chance.
announcer: he was a big surprise.
i gotta teli ya.
announcer #2:
that's gotta hurt.
- yeah! yeah!
- [crowd cheering loudly]
shit.
hyah!
- break free!
- i can't!
if you can still breathe,
you can still fight.
you're only beaten
when you decide to be.
again!
- [law grunts)
- [crowd cheering]
- yes! come on.
- come on, jin.
announcer: an unknown has
just become the people's choice.
[crowd cheering]
respect. do you hear it?
[crowd chanting]
jin, jin, jin, jin, jin, jin,
jin, jin, jin, jin, jin, jin, jin, jin,
jin, jin, jin, jin,
jin, jin, jin, jin,
jin, jin, jin, jin, jin,
jin, jin, jin, jin, jin.
[helicopter passes overhead]
i've never seen marshall law
beaten by an amateur.
ratings are up.
heihachi:
our viewers love him.
he represents the street.
let's see what
the street has taught him.
- [people chattering]
- man: come on, give him some space.
move! come on.
out of the way. come on.
give him some space.
what's your name?
- jin.
- jin.
do you know what you just did, jin?
you just beat a tekken fighter.
hey, you say
you're from the anvil, yeah?
- right.
- so who taught you to fight?
- my mother.
- [chuckles] your mother?
- no way.
- she's dead.
hey. look, you just won
the only open slot in iron fist.
every other fighter in this
tournament has sponsors,
everyone except you...
taking care of registration, paperwork,
training,
all the silly little details.
i can take care of that for you.
- what's in it for you?
- about, uh, 30%?
- but you'll take 10.
- [laughs]
i like your attitude, but no.
- 20% and we're done.
- fine.
it's a smart choice. let's go.
hey, you don't have
anything to pack, do you?
i didn't think so. come on.
jin's voice:
i remember those moves.
jun's voice: you should.
you were my best student.
you will have nothing to do
with tekken. do you understand?
the world burned because
people had to have more.
tekken was built
on people wanting more!
hi.
what's the old man waiting for?
[kisses]
i'm his son, his heir.
tekken should be mine now.
- heihachi: hazuya.
- father.
[clears throat]
i didn't see you there.
explain yourself.
we wiped out
a pocket of insurgents.
i took a moment to... unwind.
you should be
making preparations for iron fist.
everything's being taken care of.
[bottle shatters]
- after all this time...
- [choking]
...and you still don't understand.
winning iron fist means
power and prestige for tekken
and honor for the mishima name.
winning here means
we win the world.
so you've said.
hey, you stay close to me, okay?
keep your mouth shut.
hey. [chuckles]
you've got to stop checking for jacks.
- why?
- it's not the anvil.
this is civilization, my friend,
the land of opportunity.
- let's go.

raven, g-corp.
former military intelligence,
from technology to wet work.
- lethal ninjitsu expert.
- [crowd cheers]

they have signature.
[chuckles]
i'm not wearing those.
man:
see, things are different now, jin.
this is iron fist.
lron fist, image is key.
you have your signature move
and guess what...
now you have your signature look.
steve fox.
- fury: who is this guy?
- raven: never seen him before.
here's your room. sign in.
- who reps him?
- fury: just another amateur.
- he's nothing.
- [chuckles] someone must love you.
they gave you marshall law's digs.
stick around.
i'll be right back.
what's your problem?
nothing.
you know, it's rude to stare.
i'm sorry.
i was just admiring your toes.
- excuse me?
- i mean bagua zhang requires
very precise foot placement.
the way you spread your toes,
it's... uh
it's impressive.
you studied bagua?
a little.
who are you, anyway?
name's jin.
so you're the people's choice?
you seem surprised.
you don't look like much.
you'll remember you said that
when i win iron fist.
right.
[fox clears throat]
hey, jin, this way.
see you in the arena.
tv announcer: coming to you live
from this year's iron fist tournament
- in tekken city.
- [crowd cheering]
tv announcer #2:
last night history was made
when for the first time
a wildcard open call fight
was won by an unknown.
his name is jin.
this young fighter won
with spectacular style
and will appear next
to the world's greatest fighters.
fight announcer:
raven!
yeah!
announcer:
miguel rojo!
nina williams!
anna williams!
sergei dragonov!
bryan fury!
eddie gordo, valencorp!
staring at my ass is
a good way to get yours kicked.
i'd keep my head
in the game if i were you.
[grunts]
announcer:
christie monteiro, vectrocorp!
hey, jin, you feel okay?
i feel sick.
- think you're gonna puke?
- i already did that.
announcer:
the first anvil fighter ever
- to win an open call...
- go on.
...jin, the people's choice!
[cheering, scattered boos]
he was quite impressive yesterday.
yeah, but not on the same level
as the other fighters.
maybe you should ask marshall law.
he caught law at a weak moment.
why are you
so threatened by this fighter?
i'm not.
i'd just hate to see
tekken embarrassed by a lucky amateur.
[cheering)
[display beeping]
[dings]
announcer: raven versus eddie gordo
in the first round
of the iron fist tournament!
[eddie pants)
[raven shouts]
hyah!
ah!
- bring it on, boy!
- come on!
[crowd cheering loudly]
announcer:
raven is the winner
advancing to the next round.
[beeps]
[bell dings]
[display beeping]
- [dings]
- announcer: miguel rojo!
[beeping]
- [dings]
- announcer: jin, the people's choice!
you're up, kid.
good luck.
[crowd cheering]
this guy's a prick.
he thinks he's the second coming.
- he's egotistical, way overconfident...
- he's damn good.
yeah, he is.
you use that ego against him,
use your speed against him.
tire this guy out, okay?
stick and move.
miguel:
let's go! come on!
come on!
you ready? let's go!
- hey, one last thing, okay?
- miguel: i haven't got all day, jin!
you get rojo to jab,
when he throws his right,
every time he throws his right,
he locks out his left knee, okay?
great. thanks.
miguel: let's go, jin!
what are you waiting for?
use it.
miguel:
let's go! come on!
i'm waiting here. come on!
[cheering continues, scattered booing]
like i said,
not in their league.
you know where you are?
- [pants]
- this is iron fist!
- [cheering]
- come on!
- yes.
- crowd: come on, jin! come on, jin!
- [miguel grunts]
- yes.
hyah!
- wow! whoo!
- get him!
that's it, kid.
get up, jin!
shake it off! get up!
so much for the people's choice.
- shut up.
- what's the matter, monteiro?
the anvil rat got under your skin?
why don't we see what's
under your skin, cyborg?
what did you say?
you heard me.
- [young jin shouts]
- never underestimate your opponent.
watch. adapt.
every strike should be your best.
- [crowd cheering]
- that's it, kid. get up!
- [cracks]
- [screams]
- [crowd cheers]
- do it! do it, jin!
[shouts]
fox: jin!
jin!
stop it, jin! it's over!
[cheering continues]
you were saying?
[cheering continues]
- thanks for the tip.
- well, that's my job.
see, the more fights you win,
the more money l make.
- ah!
- does that hurt?
- it hurts everywhere.
- [chuckles]
nice finish.
very entertaining,
but completely out of control.
you know you don't have time
for that shit, right? huh?
i know why i'm here.
- you do?
- yeah.
good, 'cause you were
damn lucky in there.
next time you've got to get
everyone as quick as you can.
you've gotta hit 'em hard,
you've gotta hit 'em high.
steve fox.
back from the anvil.
well, we both know
tekken city is my home.
of course.
i've heard you've leant
your expertise to our new fighter.
let me introduce you.
this is... this is jin,
the people's choice.
well, congratulations
on a spectacular fight.
you've impressed my father...
not an easy task.
i'd like to thank
mr. mishima in person
for this opportunity.
well, continue winning
and you will.
there's something familiar
about your style.
did your father ever fight
in iron fist?
- didn't know my father.
- [chuckles]
well, not uncommon in the anvil.
work hard, keep training
and someday you could be
an asset to tekken.
i’ll never belong to tekken.
we'll see about that.
- what was that?
- just-just do your job.
[grunting]
jun's voice:
defeat is a choice! so is victory.
you're only beaten
when you decide! again!
[young jin shouting]
[knocks on door]
i gotta get out of here for awhile.
thought that was against the rules.
not if you don't get caught.
[beeping]
christie: come on.
[rock music playing]
man over p.a.: we've got jin,
the people's choice, entering the club!
- let's go! give it up!
- hey, jin.
- you were great today.
- thank you.
three days ago,
i had gangbangers trying to kili me.
and today you're a celebrity.
get used to it.
# decide if i wili #
# have you come home with me #
# love my mind, but you know
you know you don't... #
so what happened
out there with rojo?
i beat him.
that's what happened.
you did more than just beat him.
you almost killed him.
can i give you a little advice?
iron fist isn't about killing
- or getting yourself killed.
- so you brought me here to warn me?
i'm just saying an attitude
like that is gonna get you in trouble.
i guess i should be
more in control... like you.
you don't know anything about me.
you grew up just outside
the american territories.
your grandfather
taught you how to fight,
entered you
into amateur leagues,
made you a champion.
i've seen all the iron fist promos.
well, those promos
don't showcase all my skills.

# sugar hiller,
are you dying for more? #
# to die, so sweet,
so slow, it kills me #
# seek you out,
creeping in your pleasure dome... #
[chuckles softly]
shh shh shh.
okay, he's gone.
- oh, i shouldn't.
- i think you should.
oh, i need sleep.
i may have to kick your ass
tomorrow morning.
you promise?
mmm.
[sighs]
go to bed.
woman: hyah!
[weapons zing]
- [women shout]
- [jin grunting]
[glass shatters]
- [door rattles]
- [whispering] jin!
stand up for christ's sake.
[grunts]
i knew it. they're worried
because they actually believe
you have a shot.
nothing changes.
there's no way...
no way they're gonna let someone
from the anvil win the iron fist.
jin: maybe it has to do
with something else.
where did you get this?
it belonged to my mother.
jun hazama.
i knew her.
- you knew her?
- we were in iron fist together.
that's not possible.
she was a tekken fighter, jin.
she was good.
you don't know
what you're talking about.
everything about
your mother was... unique,
even her fighting style.
why didn't she say anything?
why would she lie to me?
maybe she was trying
to protect you, jin.
listen to me, jin. right now
you need to get out of here.
- go underground.
- she's right.
- i'm not leaving.
- forget iron fist.
i don't give a damn
about iron fist.
i came here to kill
heihachi mishima.
[both grunting]
do you know
what a nightmare this is?
- i think you worry too much.
- don't talk back to me.
you failed me.
he's still alive.
it was a fluke.
it won't happen again.
no.
you underestimated him
and now i have to
clean up your mess.
[man grunts]
- [beeping]
- [crowd cheering]
just stay where
the tv cameras can see you.
they won't try anything
with the world watching.
- [dings]
- announcer: christie monteiro!
- [dings]
- announcer: nina williams!
- i think it was her.
- what?
jin:
nina williams.
she was one of the assassins.
good to know.
out a little late last night?
i like your boyfriend.
he's cute.
sorry. i don't share.
$100,000 global to whoever kills
that kid from the anvil.
what makes you think
i need your money?
hyah!
replacing bone with flex steel
isn't cheap, is it, bryan?
neither is the maintenance.
it's no wonder
you can punch through walls.
i am what the corporations made me.
as i recall
bio-enhancements are
illegal in iron fist.
christ, bryan,
you're half robot.
you'll be banned for life.
hyah!
lock in the fight selector.
heihachi:
what are the jacks doing here?
hazuya:
extra security.
there was an incident
inside the barracks last night.
i read the report, insurgent
forces inside tekken.
there is no reason for concern. i have
dealt with the problem personally.
heihachi: i don't want anything
to happen to this young fighter.
[crowd cheering]
- hey, how you feeling?
- i'm good.
[beeping]
- [dings]
- announcer: jin, the people's choice!
let me see.
oh shit.
- [dings]
- announcer: yoshimitsu!
here, i have something for you.
my old power gloves.
[chuckles]
whoa. it's been a long time.
a little worse for wear now.
give me your hand.
gonna keep these safe.
when you're out there today,
you stay smart, okay?
you've gotta bob. you've gotta weave.
you've gotta fly if you have to.
but you don't let
yoshimitsu touch you...
ever.
take him.
- nice.
- uh-huh.
- [beeping]
- recycle the challenger selection.
- what are you doing?
- this match is better suited
for the semifinal.
- woman: come on, jin!
- [cheering]
no. you can't do that.
these two have to fight now.
are you questioning me?
no, i'm replacing you.
- [grunts]
- jacks!
what are you doing?
stand down!
you put me in charge of security,
remember, father?
the jackhammers answer to me.
hazuya, do not do this.
it's done.
i am through waiting.
tekken is mine.
maintain the original
fight selection.
jesus.
tv announcer: yoshimitsu was
- a past iron fist champion.
- let's go, man! let's go, let's go!
oh, damn it.
- yes!
- yeah!
look at the ratings...
- through the roof.
- [beeping]
you see, the only thing audiences
crave more than blood is death.
you see, father?
i have learned.
[chuckles]
announcer:
yoshimitsu is out for blood!
he's decimating jin!
[jin grunting]
ah. come on.
stop the fight!
there is no honor in this.
you are about to witness
the death of jin hazama.
- hazama?
- hazuya: apparently the byproduct
of one of my youthful indiscretions.
you have a son.
i had a son.
ah!
- man over p.a.: security alert!
- [alarm blaring]
- security alert!
- destroy the mask of death
and you will see there is
nothing behind it to fear.
[shouts]
- [cheering stops]
- man: security alert!
damn you, old man!
you will regret this.
- take him.
- [jack speaks japanese]
- security alert!
- not like this.
[booing]
- jin. take these off.
- man: security alert!
we've gotta get him
out of tekken city.
[jin groaning]
man: iron fist fighters are
to be detained.
- [jack speaks japanese)
- [crowd booing]
[people screaming]
over here.
jesus.
they're arresting mishima.
we need to get out of here now.
come on, let's go. this way.
- oh shoot.
- [jacks speak japanese]
oh shit.
you can't arrest us.
we're iron fist fighters.
now get in there!
[gate shuts]
[jin groaning]
- his shoulder's dislocated.
- get a hand over here?
why the hell are you looking at me?
- you wanna help here?
- just do it!
fox: let's get you up.
it's gonna hurt, okay?
come on.
okay?
okay. on...
- [cracks)
- ...three.
- thanks.
- [groans]
what are you trying to do?
my father always stressed
the importance of iron fist.
frankly, i never saw the value.
it was a brutal, mindless game,
but i finally understand.
in the arena, reception is power.
after the audience thought
jin killed yoshimitsu,
ratings spiked
to their highest level ever,
which is why i've decided
that the remainder
of the tournament's fights
will be to the death.
i am sure you'd all rather die
fighting in the arena.
lron fist continues tomorrow.
i suggest you get some rest.
so what now?
hill or be killed.
jin:
we have a choice.
if there are no fighters,
there is no tournament
- and no one has to die.
- [footsteps approach]
man: all right,
line up against the wall.
hands behind your back.
hands behind your back i said.
i don't think so.
come on! let's move now!
[guns firing]
this way! come on!
[distant gunfire]
damn.
lock us down.
mishima.
- mishima!
- fox: take it easy, jin.
- jin hazama.
- you owe me a life, mishima.
i owe you nothing, young man.
how does it feel to be behind bars?
we've gotta move!
i'm gonna need
those access codes right now.
get me out of here.
i can help.
- [gunshot]
- [grunts]
- hey.
- [gunfire continues]
- [grunts, groans)
- [beeps]
- fox: this way, old man.
- [gunfire continues]
heihachi mishima is with them.
they're heading towards
the workers' access gate.
[helicopter passes overhead]
fox:
move it! come on!
- [jin groaning]
- get in.
- are you okay?
- you'll be okay.
- yes, i'm alive.
- hazuya will be sending
- the jackhammers.
- jin: i know a safe house.
- it's not far.
- so maybe i'm crazy.
- can we go?
- come on.
tear the anvil apart.
i want the fighters found
and recaptured.
- go!
- [jack speaks japanese]
- [whispering] rest. rest.
- [groans] ow.
[distant gunshot]
a moment.
i knew your mother jun hazama.
formidable fighter.
one of tekken's best.
my mother tried to keep me
away from tekken.
- now i know why.
- do not judge ali of tekken
- by hazuya's mistakes.
- mistakes?
- tekken destroys lives.
- i created tekken
not only as a corporation
but as a means to stem the chaos.
we are remaking a world,
raising it from the ashes.
you tell that to the people dying
every day in the anvil.
we brought humanity
back from the brink,
- restored order. tekken is peace.
- tekken is fear!
my mother's blood is
on your hands, mishima.
i saved your mother's life.
what the hell are
you talking about?
many years ago after a tournament,
i found her beaten, violated.
i'm the one that had
her taken from tekken city.
there was always a sadistic part
of him that i could never control.
who?
hazuya, my son,
your father.
you're lying!
until today,
there was only one heir
to the tekken throne.
now there are two.
- [sirens blaring]
- jacks!
ah!
- [helicopter whirring]
- [jack speaking japanese]
get down, jin!
run! run!
[jack speaks]
- [electricity crackling]
- [screams]
what?
you thought i'd do nothing?
tekken belongs to me.
you never understood
the spirit of tekken.
that's why i could not place
tekken in your hands.
tekken is in my hands, old man.
don't you see?
it's over for you now.
it's not about me or you.
it's about the mishima name...
a name that
you have not lived up to.
and that's why, in the end,
you will fail.
take heihachi mishima away.
destroy everything,
including him.
i am mishima heihachi.
[emphatically]
i am tekken.
heihachi mishima is dead.
[crowd cheering]
citizens of tekken and the world,
today iron fist will make history
and you will be history's witness.
the remaining fighters will no longer
fight for the simple glory of victory.
no, they will fight
as we all must fight
every day we draw breath.
they will fight for their lives.
they will fight to the death.
[crowd cheering]
[display beeping]
[dings]
announcer:
sergei dragonov and bryan fury
in the first round
of the iron fist semifinals!
- [shouting)
- [growls]
[both shout]
ah!
- [chain squelches)
- [cheering loudly]
- what, no hug for your old man?
- [yells]
i remember your mother.
she put up quite a fight.
frankly, if i knew
that whore was pregnant,
i would've killed her
right then and there.
you want to kill me,
don't you?
i understand that.
but in order to get to me, you'll have
to kill the champion, bryan fury.
that's how iron fist works.
[yells, groans]
- get off of me!
- imagine what i'll do to her
if you don't fight.
- [grunts]
- [gun cocks]
you will fight,
the world will watch
and my legacy will be written
with your blood.
take her.
[distant cheering]
when the time comes,
i pray you die screaming.
behave yourself.
[groaning]
jin, i saw what you did to rojo.
you let your anger
take control of you.
anger doesn't fuel
the fighter's soul, it incinerates it.
but before that i saw something.
i saw greatness in you.
you're not just fighting
for yourself anymore, jin.
you're fighting for all of us.
you can become champion.
there are a lot of people
depending on it.
[crowd cheering]
- fox: so who taught you to fight?
- jin: my mother.
- attack!
- hyah! hyah! hyah!
- your mother?
- she's dead.
[jun laughs] do you think
that life on the other side of that wall
- will bring you happiness?
- [yelling]
- jun: trust me, it won't.
- i told you, man.
this asshole is a waste of time.
he's just another punk
who'd rather die in the anvil
than stand up like a man.
what you are, jin, is a believer
in the cause. you just don't know it.
christie:
so you're the people's choice?
you don't look like much.
hara: my father was killed
in a jackhammer raid.
and what did anyone
do about it? nothing.
jun: one day we'll have
a chance to make a difference.
- that's why i trained you so hard.
- [shouts]
jun: because one day you won't
just be fighting for you or me.
you'll be fighting for all of us.
i love you, jin.
[crowd cheering]
announcer:
bryan fury versus jin,
the people's choice!
[crowd chants]
jin, jin, jin, jin, jin, jin!
it all comes down to this moment.
two fighters remain... bryan fury
and jin, the people's choice!
[crowd chanting]
fury, fury, fury, fury,
fury, fury, fury, fury, fury,
fury, fury, fury...
[chanting fades]
ain't nothing
gonna save you now, boy.
- [jin yelling]
- [shouts]
[crowd cheering]
[grunts]
announcer: it's been a hell
of a run for this young fighter,
but can he last
against bryan fury?
- [clangs]
- [electricity crackles]
[clangs]
[crowd shouting]
[crowd cheering]
every opponent has its weakness.
[ratchets]
jun:
see it, exploit it and strike.
jin. come on, jin. jin. jin.
[cheers]
- jin, jin...
- both: jin, jin, jin, jin.
[all chanting)
jin, jin, jin, jin, jin.
[shouts]
- yeah! yeah!
- yes! yes!
- yeah!
- announcer: what an impact!
- man: did you see that?
- this kid is full of surprises.
- he just knocked out bryan fury.
- [cheering]
[breathing heavily]
enough. introduce me,
the final match.
- no.
- [grunts]
jin won. he's the champion.
you can't kill him.
watch me.
[door slams]
[beeps]
announcer:
now entering the arena,
fighting for the honor
of the tekken corporation
hazuya mishima!
i should thank you.
your coming here
gave me the opportunity
to take control of tekken.
[hazuya grunting]
[screams]
[cheering]
your mother taught you many styles,
all quite strong.
yes.
there it is.
the lust for vengeance,
the hunger to kill
like fire coursing
through your veins.
you can't deny it, jin.
it's what makes you who you are,
the curse of the mishima blood.
like father, like son.
[scattered boos]
[yells]
[guns firing]
[crowd cheering]
[grunting]
it's your curse, not mine.
you won.
citizens of tekken and the world,
i give you jin hazama,
the winner of iron fist,
the people's choice,
- now the people's champion.
- [cheering]
- yeah!
- hey!
yeah!
i never thought
i'd live to see this day.
you have got to say that that is
the greatest champion ever.
drinks on the house!
- drinks on me!
- both: yeah!
- where you gonna go?
- it's time to go home.
[crowd chanting]
jin, jin, jin, jin, jin,
jin, jin, jin,
jin, jin, jin,
jin, jin, jin, jin, jin, jin,
jin, jin, jin,
jin, jin, jin,
jin, jin, jin, jin!
[crowd cheering]
[grunting]
[door bangs]
christie's voice:
on that day, the house of mishima fell,
tyranny had been
challenged and defeated
and the name hazama
became synonymous
with hope,
strength and freedom.
but freedom comes and goes,
and the world had
no idea or warning
that the true legacy of tekken
was only just beginning.
