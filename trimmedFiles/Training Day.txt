my wife, all right?
yeah, that's my point,
you see?
you're so in love,
the shit is coming
out of your eyes.
the day you bring
your old lady to the office
is the day that you don't
make it back home.
you got to hide that love deep
inside you, you understand?

out here on the street,
they'll find it.

hey...
here's a joke, boy.
a man walks out of his house
on his way to work,
sees this snail
lying on his porch.
so he picks it up,
chucks it over the roof
into the backyard.
snail bounces off a rock,
busts its shell up
all to shit,
lands in the grass.
hmm? snail lies there dying.
but the snail doesn't die.
and then after a while,
it can crawl again.
and one day the snail
up and heads back
to the front of the house.
and finally, after,
oh, about a year,
the little guy crawls
back on the porch.
right then the man
walks out of his house
on his way to work.
he sees this snail again.
so he looks at it,
and he says...
"what the fuck is
your problem?!"
that's not funny.
that's not funny.
what you
laughing for then,
...if it isn't funny?
i don't know, man. i...
hey, hey!

yeah, well, i...
i already
figured them out.
oh, yeah?
oh, really?

you already
figured the streets out?
yeah, well, it's...
it's all about
smiles and cries.

out of his mind.
hey, hold on, alonzo.
hold on, hold on.
smiles and cries.
smiles and cries.
smiles and cries.

captain's riding my ass
the entire time.
sentencing was today.
judge is female.
that's right.
landers.
yeah, i know landers.
she's a sharp lady.
no?
so before
the hearing,
guy gets hold of
some peanut butter,
packs his ass crack
with it...
what?
then he's standing tall
before the bench,
and he's waiting
to give his statement.
so he shoves
his hand down his pants,
comes out with a gob
of extra-chunky jif.
bailiffs won't
come near him.
now he's... now he's looking
the judge right in the eyes
and licks his fingers clean.
holy shit.
so the judge says, uh,
"oh, this poor man's insane.
he can't go to prison."
orders him to psychiatric.
she fell for it.
yeah. that's because
she's so fucking smart.
time she found out
it was sandwich spread,
the order was signed,
the guy's been transferred.
proceedings closed.
yeah, closed.
that prick will do 6 months
in the puzzle factory,
then they'll call him normal
and let him loose.
never, ever do
a day in prison.
yeah, give him
credit, though.
shit, he worked
the system,
deserves
his freedom.
yeah? think so?
or not.
i'll tell you what.
i'm going to find
this guy on the street...
and i'm going to do him.
you better take his
bullets from him, stan.
shit.
ahh...
alonzo...

weekend in vegas.
how did you ever
screw up so bad?
nothing. it's nothing.
forget it.
you know, i didn't know.
it's not my town.
i'm not omniscient.
the russians don't
care if you have a badge.

off the radar, you?
i'm just taxing him,
that's all.
ok?

yeah, i got the picture.
hey, hey, hey!

you pointed a gun at me!
there will not
be a third.
god damn, boy!
that's what i'm
talking about, jake.
my niggah. are you all
watching this? that's it.
it'd be my pleasure to put
a hydra shock in that melon.
hey, hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
no, but i'm
going to be cool.
now drop
the fucking gun now!
you want to shoot me,
paul, go ahead,
but i'm taking
him with me.
i'm going,
alonzo.
this motherfucker is
a fed, man.
no, he is no fed.
he's just a choir boy
with a heart that got
the drop on all you fools.
listen, everybody just
take a deep breath,
and just diffuse this thing.
you hear me, jake?
you can't pull
this shit on me, man.
i didn't
sign up for this.
ok, ok.
i know you're angry.
everybody,
just put your guns down.
hell, no.
no, no, no, no...
choir boy first.
hey, listen to me.
put the guns down!
that's an order.
put them down!
use your ears
and you hear me, jake.
sometime we got to take
this shit all the way.
it's not like we do this
every day, all right?
it's just the nature
of the business.
now, no one will
ever ask you again
to pull the trigger if you
don't want to, all right?
hey, mark, where are
you transferring to?
s.i.s.
s.i.s.
detective.
you give me 18 months,
i give you a career.
we make the big
seizures, jake.
we make
the big arrests.
but if you're
in my unit,
you got to be in it
all the way
or not at all,
you understand me?
i mean, i thought
you were man enough
to handle this shit.
i guess i was wrong.
decorated officers
says that you're
the shooter, ok?
the investigators
are going to want to pull...
... a tube of your blood
to check for intoxicants.
what are they going to find,
jake? do the math.
you been smoking p.c.p.
all day, haven't you?
huh? remember?
you've been
planning this all day.
i've been planning it
all week, son.
you talk that crazy shit,
i'll make sure your blood
gets to the lab.
you want to walk your little
baby nuts around the block,
you won't make it
to the corner,
but if you're cool...
if you're cool...
you're a hero.
you're a virgin shooter
above suspicion.
alonzo,
there's 2 shots left
in that other stinger.
we need to just kill
your boy right now,
and say roger got him
coming through the door.
no, we are
killing nobody.
this is a good man
right here.
he's got the magic eye.
i can feel it.
just had a little
freak out, that's all.
we all been there.
no, i say he's cool.
and i say nobody is
going to hurt him.
but you do have
a decision to make, jake.
because in about
this place is going to be
overrun with blue suits.
so why don't you
please go outside,
clear your head...
or shoot me.
hey, paul.
you're dead,
motherfucker!
you hear me?
you're fucking dead!
yeah. 
ha, that's right.
well, lay off that rice.
all right.
yeah, just make sure that
bathtub is clean, homey.
all right?
all right. later.
you all right?
it behooves you
not to dick around
on this one.
justifiable homicide
in the line of duty, ok?
now what happened...
what happened was murder...
and armed robbery.
oh, wait. we... we had badges,
so it's different?
oh, son, open your eyes.
can't you see? huh?
that man was your friend,
and you killed him
like a fly.
come on.
my friend, huh?
yeah.
tell me why.
because he knows
my first name?
son, this is the game.
i'm playing his ass.
that's my job.
that's your job.
roger sold dope to kids.
the world is a better
place without him.
hey, this man was
the biggest major violator
in los angles.
i watched that cocksucker
operate with impunity
for over 10 years,
and now i got him.
this shit is chess.
it isn't checkers.
what you think we going to do?
we going to... we going to roll up
in a black-and-white, huh?
slap the cuffs on him.
"you're under arrest."
that's a high roller, dog.
take the money.
hey, man, i already told you,
i'm not going to take that.
i'm not going to take that.
ok, don't. just burn it,
barbecue it,
fish fry it.
i don't give a fuck,
but the boys will
feel better about it.
fuck their feelings.
jake, you're
not making them feel
like you're
part of the team.
the team?
you guys are fucking insane.
all right.
i'll go back to the valley.
i'll cut parking tickets,
you know?
god.
it... it can't be like this.
it is this way, man.
i'm sorry i exposed you
to it, but it is.
it's ugly,
but it's necessary.
i became a cop
to put away drug dealers,
the poisoners, the criminals,
not to be one.
you sound just like me,
and i know what
you're going through.
i know what
you're feeling.
you're scared.
i'm not scared.
yes, you are.
you're terrified.
everybody goes through
that the first time.
i went through it.
the sooner you can match
what's in your head
with what's going on
in the real world,
the better
you're going to feel.
in this business,
you got to have
a little dirt on you
for anybody
to trust you,
and when all this
is behind you,
there's going to be
a whole other world
that opens up for you.
i walk a higher path, son.
i can give you the keys
to all the doors.
what are you talking about?
my guys are pretty good,
but they're not leaders.
they're clowns.
you're a leader.
you want my job?
you got it.
you want to lock up
poisoners?
this is the best place
to do it.
but you got to just,
you know, take your time.
you make detective.
you play the game.
you grow wise, and then
you can change things,
but you got to change them
from the inside, son.
let's go downtown
to the station.
you talk to my guy stan,
and he'll walk you through
what you got to say
to the da. guys, ok?
ok.

up in chino.
i promised i'd take care
of his family for him.
