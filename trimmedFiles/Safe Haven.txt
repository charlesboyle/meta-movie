the case is closed.
i've got open cases to work now.

even if there's a slight chance
he's innocent...

or something that you
can go home and irritate?
look... no one's innocent.
no one.
i don't care if he killed her himself.
he was there. he knows what happened.

i don't know.
what do you mean, you don't know?
just one time, could i get
a picture of you with your fish?
why do you always
have to take pictures?
i don't know, josh, because i want to be
able to remember this stuff, that's why.
try to remember without the camera.
<font color="#808080">alex:</font> <i>what do i do about josh?</i>
he's testing me.
do you think it's just a phase?
i hope so. <font color="#d900d9">(sighs)</font>
no, i see the way he pushes your buttons.
josh was young,
but he remembers her, you know?
lexie remembers
the idea of her and...
it's just... there's a difference.
you know?
<font color="#808080">katie:</font> have you talked to him?

<font color="#d900d9">(chuckling)</font>
yeah, a little too sleepy sometimes,
if you ask me.
- well, the grass is always greener, so...
- yeah, but it's nice. you'll like it.
are you staying or... you just passing
through, or what's your story?
so many questions.
just curious.
what about you?
- are you from here?
- i'm from wilmington.
we used to come here quite a bit
when i was a kid.
stayed for a few weeks, i loved it.
my uncle roger,
the guy that i work with at the store...
- yeah.
- ...worked with him for a few weeks
out of the summer...
...then when we got pregnant
it just seemed like...

we'll probably grill that up tonight.
- yeah? well, good.
- mm-hm.
i don't know how to grill flounder,
but i'm sure you do.
- oh, it's pretty simple.
- yeah?

there's plenty of food in the fridge.
as you know, the kids won't be shy
about telling you what they don't like.
- well, it's gonna rain, you know?
- what?
it's not gonna rain.
i checked the weather report.
it said a five percent chance of rain.
yeah, well,
the weather report's wrong.
they have instruments for this.
doppler, super doppler,
all kinds of other crap.
you have an arthritic knee.
it tightens up, it's gonna rain.
- don't need a doppler or super doppler...

did you used to, um...
come here with your wife?
yeah.
does it get better? with time?
<font color="#d900d9">(sighs)</font>
yeah, yeah.
yeah, at first, i tried to avoid
any place that we went together.
i tried to forget, i tried
to put it all behind me.
i tried to, you know...
just look forward.
but it just didn't work.
and i realized that if...
...if i'm not thinking about her, who is?
you know? and she didn't deserve that.
she was an amazing woman
and i loved her
and i want my kids to know that.
i want them to know her.
so... i don't know, i just...
we're just keeping our heads down.
getting to play mom and dad
which is interesting.
just trying to keep it all together, really.
but today with you, this is probably
the first time that i've looked up.
it's a perfect day.
did you feel that?
no.
all right.
it's just a little light shower.
it'll pass in a bit.
- yeah, just a little...
- let's go over here.

coming back from charlotte.
he should be able to pick us up
on his way back through,
but he isn't picking up his phone, so...
well, no rush.
i mean, i'm happy here.
- so...
- yeah?
yeah.
it's a big study. that's
what this whole book is about.
what i always wondered was gorillas,
maybe the strongest animals on the planet.
- primates, anyway.
- yeah. mm-hm.
- don't eat meat.
- fruits and vegetables.
they eat mostly kale.
yes, kale is fantastic for your body.
is there protein in kale
or is that just...?
- i'm sure there is.
- where does the strength come from?
- they have <i>to...</i> it has to be genetic.
- it's genetic, but...
except what are you gonna eat?
fruit, vegetables, nuts...
i'm guessing rhett will be here soon.
i should probably settle the...

- i've gotta get out of here.
i've been here for too long.
whoa, what are you talking about?
you just got here.
it's exactly what i was afraid of, jo.
the things i've done... i can't stay.
ok, katie, let's just calm down, ok?
we can figure this out. all right?
wait, does alex
know that you're leaving?
who do you think was
the one who told me to go?
alex wants nothing
to do with me anymore.
and frankly, i don't blame him.
look, katie, if you run now,
you're taking the easy way out.
the easy way?
you think this is easy for me?
you obviously don't know me.
katie, you have people here
who care about you.
i think that you should stay here
and face whatever this is.
face things the way you face things?
excuse me?
come on, jo. you know you're
stuck here and for no good reason.
at least i know when
it's time for me to leave.
yeah, you're right, katie.
but some of us don't have that choice.
good luck, katie.

we can get the police involved.
i can talk to rhett.
you don't understand, alex,
he is the police.
my husband's a cop in boston.
that's why he could do all that.
i don't care, all right?
i'm not gonna let him hurt you anymore.
i'm not gonna let him hurt you anymore.
it doesn't even matter.
i can't put you through that.
i can't put your family through that.
he's always gonna be there.
- he doesn't quit.
- katie. listen to me.
i'm in love with you.
i'm in love with you.
and if you stay, i promise...
...there's no safer place in the world
than right here with me.
god, i'm so scared.
i know you are,
but you don't have to be.
you don't have to be scared.
i love you.
