<i>of an unprecedented</i>
<i>technological advancement.</i>
we have begun to identify
so-called goldilocks planets.
these are planets that share a
similar relationship with their sun
<i>as we have with ours.</i>
<i>if a planet's too far away</i>
<i>from its sun, it's too cold.</i>
<i>if it's too close to</i>
<i>its sun, it's too hot.</i>
<i>but for an earth-like planet,</i>
<i>the distance is just right.</i>
<i>potentially perfect</i>
<i>for sustaining life.</i>
we have finally managed
to identify one planet
<i>that is the right distance</i>
<i>from its star to hold water</i>
<i>and is the right mass</i>
<i>to sustain an atmosphere.</i>
<i>every 24 hours,</i>
<i>our station in hawaii</i>
<i>will transmit a signal to landsat</i>
<i>7, our deep orbiting satellite,</i>
which will amplify and relay the
signal to our targeted planet
which is, rather grandly,
entitled planet g.
if there is intelligent life
out there, and they come here
it's going to be like
columbus and the indians.
only, we're the indians.
ladies and gentlemen, please prepare to
bear witness to the making of history.
start transmission.

birthday boy.
<i>jackie: ...or anything that</i>

a toast.
happy birthday,
little brother.
i'm wishing you success and
growth, and happiness.
may this be
a great year for you.
it's going to
be a great year.
i love you.
i love you, too.
so, in the great
hopper family tradition,
this year i'm quoting
from coach john wooden.
johnny.
"adversity is
the state in which man
"most easily becomes
acquainted with himself
"being especially free
of admirers then."
cheers.
i'm not cheers-ing that.
it's a very
good quote for you.
"i may be free of admirers right
now but there is still time"?
will you shut up?
light your cupcake
and raise your glass.
did you get me that?
yes, i got you that.
thank you,
that's very sweet.
you're welcome.
you're very welcome.
i got this guy, tony. he said he
can get you a construction job.
all you need to
do is call him.
could i get a beer and a
chicken burrito, please?
sorry, kitchen's closed.
stone: you're not going
to call him, are you'?
give tony my best,
but i don't need you
or tony's help,
for that matter.
you can call him or
join me in the navy.
no.
great. all right.
happy birthday. blow out
your candle and make a wish.
do not waste
a wish on a girl.
wish for a job,
an apartment.
a new alternator belt, so i don't
have to drive you everywhere.
a job, or...
you said "job" twice.
it's my birthday and my wish.
all right?
please don't waste it.
you just wasted
that wish, didn't you?
i'm going in.
you're not going in.
how do i look?
wait, let me
just fix that.
awesome!
all right, princess,
go get 'em.
great start.
ugh.
what seems to
be the problem?
i want a chicken burrito.
johnny, chicken burrito her.
bartender: lt ain't happening.
chicken burrito her.
kitchen's closed, hopper.
what's your name?
i'm hungry-
that's not your name.
if you give me five minutes
i will get you
your chicken burrito.
five minutes,
starting now.
(belches)
chicken burrito time, i'm out.
chicken burrito,
roger that.
hopper: wait! hi!
no! let's just...
just one twist of the key
and we will be good.
how are you, ma'am?
how you doing?
burritos, right there.
it's closed.
too late, pal.
okay.
it's right there. please?
it's too late to eat a burrito.
too many complex carbs.
$3.99...
(grunting) chicken burrito.
(grunts)
(groans)
(grunting)
(sirens wailing in distance)
i got it!
hey! freeze!
(alarm ringing)
(tires screeching)
i got a burrito!
i got it!
freeze!
(gas ps)
stay down!
man: he's getting back up!
(grunting)
stone: i've had it!
look at yourself!
how is it that you
screw everything up?
by the way, that girl you were
trying to impress last night,
do you know who
her father is?
admiral shane!
he runs the whole damn fleet!
so, now you're messing
with my job. my life!
you know that girl?
the burrito girl?
i've always stayed out of
your business, haven't i?
because i was hoping
that maybe one day
you would learn
from your mistakes.
you would grow up,
you would mature a bit!
is my back all right?
(groans)
oh, my god! my back!
you're 26, and what have you got?
you got, what?
sixty-five dollars
to your name?
i got tazed.
a car that doesn't start.
you're living on my couch!
those things work!
man, look at yourself.
oh, my god.
as from now,
as from right this second, there
is a new dynamic at play.
and this dynamic
is the following.
from here on, until i state otherwise,
there will be no more debate,
no more discussion,
no more compromise!
it's me speaking, you listening.
me saying, you doing.
do you understand that?
it's time for
a new course of action.
a new direction.
a game change.
you are joining
me in the navy.

(whistle blowing)
<i>announcer 1: a penalty kick has</i>

stone: you all right?
yeah, i'm fine.
<i>announcer 1: stone hopper</i>
<i>has come up the field.</i>
i'm fine.
i don't need your help.
bronson is going
to take it.
bronson!
what do you mean, "bronson"?
no, negative.
i'm fine. bronson,
you're gonna take this.
bronson, don't move.
bronson, come here.
bronson, you move one
more step, you're dead!
do you want to die today?
do you want to die?
good choice.
he is definitely concussed.
you just threatened
one of my sailors.
<i>announcer 1: looks like it's going to</i>
<i>be his little brother, alex hopper.</i>
<i>announcer 2: if i was stone, i</i>
<i>would have picked another shooter.</i>
<i>i'm skeptical that</i>

engage, engage.
impose will, impose will.
there are two kinds
of idiots, hopper.
one looks where he kicks,
the other looks
where he doesn't kick.
which idiot are you?
i'm the idiot that's going to kick
it through your keeper's face.
get ready for overtime.
<i>announcer 2:</i>

spectators: oh!
(whistle blowing)
<i>announcer 1: hopper sails one miles over</i>

typical.
<i>announcer 2: what a</i>
<i>heartbreak for the u.s.</i>
(all cheering)
<i>announcer 1: lt was a very poor attempt</i>
<i>by the obviously injured alex hopper.</i>
<i>he refused to</i>
<i>come out of the game</i>
<i>and his stubbornness</i>
<i>cost the united states.</i>

<i>the united states, 1.</i>
are you ready for this?
born.
are you sure?
never been more sure
of anything in my life.
what are you going to say?
i'm going to walk up
to him, man to man,
and look him
straight in the eyes.
with what words?
my words.
(chuckles)
okay. (clears throat)
"sir...
"your daughter is the best thing
that has ever happened to me.
"she's smart, kind,
beautiful, funny,
"and i'm madly
in love with her.
"it would be an honor to have
your permission to marry her."
i love you.
i love you, too.
<i>first off, i'd like to welcome you all to</i>
<i>the rimpac international na val war games.</i>
<i>and i'd like to</i>
<i>welcome you on board</i>
<i>the greatest fighting ship</i>
<i>in american naval history.</i>
<i>the “mighty mo,"</i>
<i>the u.s.s. missouri.</i>
(celtic punk music playing)
(tires screeching)
(music stops)
<i>shane: and fought</i>
<i>in world war h---</i>
shit!
hopper, your cover.
i'm keeping you
on your toes.
hopper, let's go, come on.
hopper!
hopper: this way.
no, no, no.
guard: that way, sir.
hopper: yes, yes,
i knew that.
we knew that.
you look good.
<i>the u. s. s. missouri</i>
was the final battleship
to be completed by
the united states
before being de-commissioned
and replaced
with a more modern
fleet of vessels,
like destroyers.
what's the difference between
a battleship and a destroyer?
battleships are great ships.
but they are kind
of like dinosaurs.
they're designed to take hits,
like a floating punching bag.
but then there's destroyers,
which are just awesome.
they're designed to dish it
out like the terminator.
are you a captain?
no, he's not a captain because
he's always late. come on.
<i>l fight the ship.</i>
which is even better.
(applause)
listen, get it done.
get it done.
babe, it's a formality.
okay, go.
i'm all over it.
<i>we have with us today,</i>
<i>veterans from the missouri</i>
<i>who have served on her, some</i>
<i>going back to world war ii.</i>
<i>examples of the finest men to</i>
<i>have ever served in any navy.</i>
lieutenant hopper, what an honor.
thank you for joining us.
good to be here.
<i>and now,</i>
<i>as we prepare to embark</i>
<i>on this</i>
<i>outstanding exercise...</i>
i'm nervous.
shades off.
<i>i would like the commanding</i>
<i>officers to come to the stage.</i>
<i>captain nagata, japan.</i>
(greets in japanese)
<i>captain lou, malaysia.</i>
(greeting in malay)
it's so close to
the way we say it.
he hates me.
he doesn't hate you.
shut up. shut up.
<i>shane: captain jacks,</i>
<i>australia.</i>
g'day.
shut up.
g-'day!
shut up
g'day
<i>a special acknowledgment to commander</i>
<i>stone hopper, united states navy.</i>
go, that's your call.
knock 'em out.
<i>who, along with his</i>
<i>outstanding crew and ship,</i>
<i>had the highest</i>
<i>overall rating last year.</i>
shades off, hopper.
<i>commander.</i>
<i>thank you, admiral.</i>
<i>welcome, everybody. it's really</i>
<i>great to see you all here today.</i>
<i>especially you, gentlemen.</i>
<i>it's a true honor.</i>
<i>me and my crew, we're going to</i>
<i>have to be on our toes this year</i>
<i>because your ships look outstanding</i>
<i>and your men look ready.</i>
<i>so, good luck out there.</i>
<i>be safe and keep charging.</i>
he loves his daughter, she loves you.
he's going to respect that.
hey, mike.
admiral.
you remember sam?
it's an obsolete tradition,
this asking for permission.
tell me where this came from.
stop.
sam's a physical
therapist now.
stop worrying about this and walk
up and do what you got to do.
hello, hopper.
why are you here?
this is going
to be sweet.
i was within the rules.
really?
were you in the rules when
you kicked me in the face?
isn't there something more important
you should be doing right now?
he hates the man.
that seems a bit juvenile,
wouldn't you say'?
go mess with him
and see what happens.
why?
cora: do it.
would it be funny if i
punched you in the face?
would that be funny?
stop it.
chicken.
kentucky fried chicken.
yeah, i love it.
a two-piece meal.
you look like colonel
sanders, actually.
he was a handsome man.
good job out there, dad.
what do you want?
hopper needs five
minutes of your time.
(sighs)
that's enough.
what do you mean?
don't you have something more important
you should be doing right now?
three minutes, tops.
thank you. i love you.
thank you, daddy.
love you, too.
he's going to
smash my face in.
he's not going to
smash your face in.
oh, my god.
sir, it would be an honor.
sir. sir. sir.
give me your permission.
it would be an honor
to have your permission.
sir, give me your permission.
what's your deal?
it would be a thankful honor
to have your permission
to honor your hand.
what?
oh, my god.
sir.
may i please
marry your daughter?
she's everything i have,
and i love her.
talking to yourself,
mr. hopper?
yeah, i was.
i was actually talking
about you, nagata.
mmm-hmm.
(whistling)
(crashing)
(men shouting)
hopper: that's for
kicking me in the face.
eat it! take it!
let go! let go.
what the...
(hopper yells)
sir, it was a fluke accident.
the bathroom floor was wet.
i began to fall.
captain nagata kindly
reached out to help.
yugi: our heads go bang.
we fall back.
bang, again.
just like the great
jerry lewis.
jerry lewis?
did he just say
"jerry lewis"?
yes, sir.
browley: are you kidding me?
<i>the bellboy and original</i>
<i>the nutty professor.</i>
very good movies.
he is a great
humanitarian, sir.
you both think this is a joke
and you are very much mistaken.
this will not happen again.
do i make myself clear?
yes, sir.
yes, sir.
gentlemen, give me a minute
with mr. hopper, here.
what is wrong with you?
you've got skills, but i have never
ever seen a man waste them like you.
"keep the ship out of
the surf and spray..."
"...or you will
plunge to destruction."
homer, sir.
the fact that you know that
infuriates me beyond words.
what my daughter sees in you
is a great mystery to me.
you are a very
smart individual
with very weak character, leadership
and decision-making skills.
do you have anything
to say to me? anything?
negative, sir.
enjoy these naval
exercises, hopper.
they are likely
to be your last.
dismissed.
<i>walter: is there anything</i>
<i>i can do to help?</i>
negative.
if you want to
talk about anything...
i don't.
if you change your mind...
i won't.
roger that.
contact desron one. commence
anti-submarine warfare exercises.
commence air operations.
(sailors shouting)
good afternoon, sampson.
<i>welcome to day one of</i>
<i>the rimpac naval war games.</i>
<i>we are here to sharpen</i>
<i>our skills as a team.</i>
hopper: as your
weapons officer,
let me remind you
that this is a combat vessel
and we will excel
in our command and control.
<i>stone: i want everyone</i>
<i>to stay frosty.</i>
we're going to be close-maneuvering
with 13 nations out here.
we are here to
crush every other ship.
i'm excited to
see what we learn.
we are not here in this
weapons room to learn.
be safe out there, look out for
each other and keep charging.
if we return to pearl
without having outperformed
every other ship on that ocean,
i will personally...
yo, saunders, we've ended
up in a department
run by some kind of donald
trump/mike tyson mutant combo.
what was that,
petty officer raikes?
cora: nothing, sir.
i swear you said, "donald
trump." want to clarify?
i think i heard a "mike
<i>tyson," as well.</i>
if you did, it was only
in reference to the fact
that you both project
great physical intensity, sir.
that's flattering.
hopper! there's a helo
headed for the sampson.
make sure your
ass is on it.
why?
i don't know why!
just make sure
you're on it!
copy, sir.
damn.
<i>pilot: scorpion one four, clear our deck.</i>
<i>en route with parts and techs.</i>
<i>officer: confirm</i>
<i>lieutenant hopper en route.</i>
stone: i just got off
the phone with the jag.
and?
they are probably going to
kick you out of the navy.
when?
the day we get back.
from rimpac?
yeah.
you have got to make some calls.
there has got to be...
who do i call to
teach you humility?
i am sorry,
i don't have that number.
i just don't get it, man.
you have got so
much potential.
i'm sorry you have
to deal with this.
and i am sorry
i let you down.
man: stand up nice and tall.
i want you to focus
on that green marker,
right in the middle
of your back.
mick: what do you think
i'm paying attention to?
man: keep your
feet together.
my feet can't
get any closer.
stand up tall. all right.
i had enough of this.
keep going.
just a little bit more.
turn the damned thing off!
come on.
we're just about there.
turn it off now!
i'm your new
physical therapist.
i am sensing
a lot of anger.
very perceptive of you.
is there anything besides
anger in there, mick?
not much.
your last therapist says that
you lost the will to fight.
is that accurate?
i lost my fight
when i lost my legs.
do you realize you're still the same
man that won the golden gloves at 22?
a bronze star in afghanistan?
the same man.
i am half a man.
and half a man ain't
enough to be a soldier.
that's all i have ever known.
all right. let's go.
we are going
to take a walk.
no, we are not.
legs on.
sam: you're doing pretty good for a
guy who doesn't want to be hiking.
my dog, mustard,
could climb this mountain.
great, you and mustard can go and
make some memories on mauna kea.
sounds like fun.
mustard's dead. mustard
got hit by a dump truck.
i'm sorry.
i'm over it.
hey. i thought you would
be out of range by now.
hopper: i have around
five minutes of left time.
<i>sam: how is it?</i>
it's fine.
i'm sorry. i messed up.
<i>and i'm going to talk to your</i>
<i>father as soon as i get back.</i>
stop messing things up, okay?
copy that. i love you.
i love you.
nogrady: what is it, parker?
take a look at this.
(beeping rapidly)
nice one.
it's a joke, right?
i don't think so.
(alarm beeping)
my god.
<i>(humming) (the blue danube</i>
<i>playing on headphones)</i>
cal.
(continues humming)
cal.
huh? cal!
got some weird activity
on all the radar screens.
weird?
yeah, man. really weird.
mmm-hmm.
oh, uh, dr. nogrady is
on the phone for you, too.
that is weird.
seriously, dr. nogrady?
lead with that next time.
okay, danny?
you got to start
prioritizing your information.
if you have to tell me "1,
you know what i mean?
i mean, i'm not saying
that you are a boob,
but this is
boob-ish behavior.
hi, dr. nogrady.
<i>are you seeing</i>
<i>what i am seeing?</i>
the incoming tracks.
<i>correct.</i>
i've got five
distinct objects...
<i>five distinct objects</i>
<i>that are moving in formation.</i>
they are locked
in on my signal.
they are headed
straight for me.
<i>correct.</i>
maybe we should call nasa.
<i>nasa have called us. they're</i>
<i>on the phone right now.</i>
<i>good morning,</i>
<i>mr. zapata.</i>
<i>nasa?</i>
we are tracking something
splintering off of the main group.
that's not splitting off.
that thing is breaking apart.
has anyone called the chinese?
because this is no meteor.
yes, we have checked. it's not the
russians, it's not the chinese.
maybe we should
call the air force,
because they might want
to fuel up their jets.
<i>nogrady: the air force</i>
<i>is online.</i>
it appears the event
is headed your way.
prepare yourself.
<i>roger that. how would you suggest</i>
<i>that i prepare myself} sir?</i>
brace.
(screams)
(people clamoring)
<i>man 1: let's all be seated.</i>
i am hoping somebody here
can explain this to me.
chairman: mr. secretary, four of the five
objects landed in the pacific ocean.
the fifth one appeared
to have broken apart
making significant
contact with hong kong,
but other places
were also affected.
scotland, germany,
france, even iowa.
so, what is it?
sir, at this point we are working
on a couple of theories.
and you are who, sir?
i am with nasa.
what is nasa present
in this room for?
<i>nasa director: we are looking</i>
<i>at the very real possibility</i>
<i>that this is legitimate</i>
<i>extraterrestrial contact.</i>
<i>it appears that it originated</i>
<i>from the gliese solar system.</i>
<i>home of planet g.</i>
you are saying that
we sent out a signal
and we got back
an alien response?
<i>watch officer: sir, we just</i>
<i>got word from pearl.</i>
<i>they believe whatever made</i>
<i>impact with hong kong,</i>
has also made impact
with the pacific ocean.
where in the pacific?
approximately 150 miles south
of where we are right now, sir.
it should be right there, but
we are not seeing anything.
get me the sampson.
yes, sir.
base course, 2-2-0. speed, 25.
(speaking japanese)
bridge officer:
captain on the bridge!
<i>as casualty reports come in,</i>
<i>it's still unclear exactly what</i>
<i>it was that hit hong kong.</i>
(speaking japanese)
(speaking spanish)
<i>it isn't anything</i>
<i>from this planet.</i>
<i>how do we know that?</i>
because the chinese
have sampled it.
<i>it's made of a material that does</i>
<i>not exist in the periodic table.</i>
it's literally
not of this earth.
the only element they've been
able to identify is lawrencium.
<i>lawrencium?</i>
you got to stop tapping.
you're tapping.
you're the loud one.
<i>nogrady: looking at</i>
<i>the grid patterns,</i>
<i>it's something in</i>
<i>the neighborhood</i>
<i>of solar paneling</i>
<i>or communications paneling.</i>
it may be some kind of
a communication unit.
<i>communications?</i>
<i>who is communicating what?</i>
<i>to who?</i>
(jimmy whistling)
jimmy: what the heck is that?
bridge, starboard lookout. i've
got an unknown surface contact.
bearing is 2-3-2 true,
approximately 8,000 yards.
sir?
stone: yeah.
you may want to come
take a look at this.
i am looking at it,
mr. strodell.
on the radar, sir.
something very peculiar.
stone: that's the
john paul jones, right?
yes, sir.
<i>the myoko?</i>
<i>yes, sir, it is.</i>
so, why don't i see...
see that?
combat, captain. i have a visual on the
track bearing 2-3-7 on the horizon.
<i>what do you hold</i>
<i>in that bearing?</i>
bridge, tao.
i've got nothing at 2-3-7.
i'm looking right at it, mr. hopper.
find me something.

stand by.
that's negative, sir.
scope's clear, i got nothing.
taylor, did you break
this son-of-a-bitch?
no, i didn't do
anything to it, sir.
you know i will throw
your ass off this ship.
i know you will, sir.

what is it?
i don't know.
is this some

probably.

wait, what's going on? why?
the island's under attack.
attack by who?
i don't know. people are
using the word "aliens."
aliens?
we don't know. whatever it is,
it took out the marine base
and all roads leading to this
mountain have been destroyed.
cell phones, radios, internet,
everything is shut down.
the navy's engaged,
just off of the coast.
the navy?
i need you and your friend off

we'll go block the road.

hopper: where did we find it?
jimmy: one of their
transporters must have crashed
on the way to the island.
there was debris everywhere.
thomas and potts fished him right out
of the water with a grappling hook.

idea, but they kept yanking.
i kept telling them "no,"
and they kept...
hmm...
(grunts)

(all exclaim in shock)

my dad said they would come.
he said it my whole life.
he said, "we ain't alone."
he said, "one day
we would find them,
"or they would find us."

he said...
"i hope i ain't around

he's not dead!

sam: mick,
put your gun down.
i told them that something
like this could happen.
i said, it's going to be like
columbus and the indians,
or the conquistadors
and the incans.
they just thought,
"no, they will be sweet."
they killed my grad student.
(gasping)
okay, calm down.
i can't.
slow. sit down.
i can't breathe.
sam: slow breaths,
slow breaths.
you're freaking
him out, mick.
i doubt it takes
much to freak him out.

we need all of them.
<i>nogrady: lt is the strong</i>
<i>belief of the chinese</i>
<i>that what crashed</i>
<i>into hong kong</i>
<i>was some sort of</i>
<i>communications ship.</i>
you're saying that
a flying telephone cratered
and took out 25,000 people?
<i>what i'm saying is that our visitors</i>
<i>seem extraordinarily concerned</i>
<i>with establishing a line</i>
<i>of communication home.</i>
if they have lost their communication
ship, how could they do that?
<i>the same way we did.</i>
<i>our communications station</i>
<i>in hawaii has the ability</i>
<i>to send a message to deep space</i>
<i>via the landsat 7 satellite.</i>
<i>i believe it's for that asset</i>
<i>they have domed the islands.</i>
<i>we're looking at</i>
<i>an extinction-level event.</i>
the most critical part
of any military operation.
establish communications,
reinforcements, follow-on forces.
you're saying e.t.

that would be incredibly,
incredibly bad.
so far, only five ships
have made contact.
if five ships can do this,
what do you think 50 can do,
or 500 or 5,000 or 500,000?
<i>jimmy: sir, if i could</i>
<i>just have a minute.</i>

because this is my pet lizard, sir.
penelope the third.
and? and they have
the exact same eyes.
you have 15 seconds. go.
okay, sir,
i put the helmet on,
and the helmet is, basically,
extreme sunglasses.
and it's some hydration
and some oxygen saturation,
and a bunch of other stuff
i don't understand.
but we took penelope to the beach one
time, which was a terrible idea.
she went absolutely crazy because
she can't handle the sunlight.
you see? i don't think that they
can handle the sunlight either.
you try anything else on?
negative, sir.
just the helmet.
just the helmet.

i'm far from more aware than you
of the need to get inside there.

<i>will not help.</i>
<i>you want me to</i>

i'll do it the second
you come up here
and put your ass in
the co-pilot's seat, sir!
are they transmitting?
they could be, but it
wouldn't do them any good.
there's no satellite
to receive the transmission.
we beam to landsat 7.
what's landsat 7?
it's our deep-space satellite.
it only orbits into range
once every 24 hours.
when is the satellite
in position?
we've got about five hours.
and then they will use it to
slingshot their transmission.
slingshot where?
i don't know.
wherever it is they're from.
hopper: pearl harbor here,
we're approximately here,
and they, whatever they are,
are somewhere in the middle.
we're trapped out here.
what we know right now
is we can't target them
unless we have
a plain line of sight.
without radar, we have no
way to track them, correct?
correct. but i don't think
they can see us, either.
why?
because we are still alive.
okay, so they can't see us
and we can't see them.
and we have no way to hit
them from a safe distance.
there is a way.
a way?
a way of seeing them,
without seeing them.
you're going to reference art
<i>of war right now, aren't you?</i>
what are we supposed to do, fight

it makes no sense.
that book is chinese.
it still makes no sense.
my way is much more simple.
we've been doing it to
america for 20 years.
water displacement.
how do you track
water displacement?
tsunami buoys.
tsunami buoys?
you have them
surrounding your islands,
transmitting
displacement data.
we hack into their
transmissions, form a grid.
you can't track
anything without radar.
i don't need radar.
just the radio frequencies.
turn off aegis radar, please.

<i>cora: what the hell is that?</i>
<i>hopper: it's a buoy.</i>
<i>if it gets hit by a wave,</i>
<i>it transmits a signal.</i>

so we can track

we would practice it

you dirty,
cheating, sneaky...
rough world.
i like it.
captain.
my chair is your chair, sir.
my brother would
have done the same.
i wish we could
get a hold of hopper.
who's hopper?
he's a tactical
actions officer
on an arleigh burke
class destroyer.
it has the resources that could
take this entire mountain out.
great, that makes a lot of sense.
let's call him.
we can't.
everything is jammed.
they're using an electromagnetic
field to block our signals.
it's more like a pulse, it's not a brick wall.
there are gaps, okay?
from inside the barrier we might
just be able to get a call out.
if i could get to my spectrum
analyzer, then, theoretically,
we could find a frequency
we could broadcast on...
do you have a piece of equipment
that can make a call?
yeah.
get it.
i can't because it's down
there, in that nest of aliens.
you're going to go get it.
no.
yes.
sam: yes.
we are looking for patterns
of water displacement.
hopper: that buoy
is underwater.
that's a ship.

yes, sir.
