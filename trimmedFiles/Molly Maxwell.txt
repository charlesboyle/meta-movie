whoa! unidentified flying object
and spin up. woo!
b-girl, you got some sick moves.
yeah, she could probably do something nuts.
- oh, yeah? try this.
everyone knows they've got bigger fish
to fry than breakdancing, okay?
yeah, i've got, like...
tunas to fry.
wow...
i found literally
the best dress at grandma's.
so good, right?
don't worry, molly,
i brought you a dress.
no need. i'm going
for my goihic lifile bo peep.
okay, well, you can't,
'cause that's alicia's thing.
though you would look good
with some cheek piercings.
no one's doing that right now.
uh, molly, a word?
do you wont me to clear out?
- no, it's cool, ben.
we're all stuck on this planet together.
so, alien,
banjo, graphic-novelling
and now breakdance.
you were completely devoted
to each of these.
i was.
and then i wasn't
ben, you should hear
this girl play banjo.
clawhammer?
- i know, i know.
i'm the next matokie slaughte.
come see me monday with a plan.
if you don't like the electives on offer,
you can pick anything in the entire universe.
a parallel universe, even.
but you'd better do it quickly,
because it's frickin' march.
leaf broccoli?
come, you spirits that tend
on mortal thoughts,
unsex me here.
and fill me from the crown
to the toe,
top-full of direst cruelty.
a bold interpretation, alicia.
i can't believe i hooked up with her
during her bi-curious phase.
molly maxwell.
think you can top that?
i have a sore throat.
come on, molly, don't do
the boring slacker thing with me.
she's not a slacker, okay?
she has a genius iq, fyi.
right. i forgot everyone of phoenix
is a precious snowflake.
please just be ready for next time.
i have it in my teeth.
aw. yeah, you actually
drew blood that time,
i promise you.
- well, beauty is pain.
um... okay, it says
to just put it on your tongue.
okay... one for you.
say, "ah!"
molly, are you okay?
hello? genius.
tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
creeps in this petty pace from day to day.
to the last syllable of recorded time,
and all our yesterdays have lighted fools
the way to dusty death. out, out,brief candle.
life’s but a walking shadow,
a poor player, that struts and frets his hour
upon the stage, and then is heard no more.
it is a tale fold by an idiot,
full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
wow.
oh, it's you again.
so, what are you on?
acid, but i'm not a slacker.
kids still do acid?
i kinda came out here
to be alone, so...
all right.
what you need to do is find a safe place
to go and enjoy it.
i know right now it might feel
like you're never gonna be normal again,
that you're gonna spend the rest of your life
trapped in some guest bathroom seeing elves
climbing out the wallpaper,
but... you'll come down eventually.
hi. i'm ben carter.
i'm molly's english teacher.
evan maxwell.
she's not in any trouble, is she?
no, just a little bit
too much red bull, i think.
pleased to meet you,
mr. maxwell.
no sleepover tonight?
- shit!
what if we've been
permanently altered by this?
i think we should just stay
in this fort forever.
yeah, let's never leave.
what's the big deal, raymond?
i have a decent average.
true. but the elective program
is what makes phoenix so special.
have you ever thought
that maybe everyone at this school
is a little too special?
- no, i haven't
you know, molly,
this planet isn't made
for every alien,
but i, for one,
would be very disappointed
if it turned out that regular school
was a better match for you than phoenix.
no! i'll just...
i'll figure something out
by tomorrow, okay?
okay
- okay
that's my favourite star child.
okay.
what did raymond want?
well, you know, i'm just getting
a prodigy of the year award.
you know, tafiana thinks
i have a real shot at this fairfax school.
is's almost impossible
to get on audition.
call me later, okay?
wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
hi.
what are you listening to?
- paint thinners.
you heard of them before?
- yeah.
they're on my dad's label.
maxwell music.
maxwell music.
that's pretty cool.
yeah.
- so?
you solve the great
elective conundrum yet?
no, but raymond has threatened
to kick me out of school
if i don't pick something.
- so pick something.
i can't find the right thing.
- it's just an elective.
all right, well, i saw
you were taking pictures at the dance
before you had that little meltdown.
maybe you could do something
with that.
they were just stupid pictures
of my friends.
lorry wallace got: famous
faking pictures of his friends.
is if any worse
than painting unicorns,
or making paper sculptures
and setting them on fire?
what was that class called?
art therapy.
i like unicorns.
- who doesn't?
that way, next to crack whore alley?
crack whores
are a photographer's dream.
yeah, okay. see you.
- hey, alien.
this whole elective thing doesn't have
to be some big life crisis, all right?
just pick something that you don't hate,
and do it, and get raymond off your back.
but i have to pick something
i can be great at.
for christ's sake, you're 16!
you don't have to have a retrospective
at moma next year.
it's still just high school,
no matter what phoenix says.
good night, molly.
'night.
hey-
i have to meet caitlin
of the studio,
and your dad has a label thing,
with heidi, so...
can you watch aiden for me?
- i can stay by myself!
at school today,
i saw cm owl barf up a skeleton.
why do you have owls
at school?
he's something, isn't he?
he's really something.
what?
- your brother.
oh, yeah.
don't get too carried away.
he'll probably end up on meih
working at the 7-eleven.
ouch.
what is that?
- it's for my new elective.
i was thinking of photography, maybe.
that's great!
observing the world
from behind the lens.
i think your dad
has an old film camera here.
yeah, but everything is
digital now, so...
we can go and see if there are
any workshops at artscape.
okay, don't.
don't ruin it before i start,
so just...
bye.
there's leftover kale
and quinoca soup. bye!
photography! well, well.
i'd need someone to supervise
on independent study.
maybe... ben carter?
he seems to know a lot
about photography.
well, ben's sort of been parachuted
into this madness midyear.
it's a lot to cope with.
but wendy,
maybe wendy could do if.
i can't wait to see your warped photos!
maybe this is the ticket!
don't have a fit or anything.
- i can if i want.
you guys might recall
that this natural versus unnatural stuff
we also discussed
when we were of hamlet last month.
thank you for your undivided attention,
as usual.
so? what makes you think
that teaching photography
to a chronic bailer like you
is how i wcmf to spend my free time?
i've heard you didn't have
anything else to do. it's like charity.
i heard wendy was gonna do it.
- i'd feel really bad
taking her away from art therapy.
it's important work.
i'm sorry, molly.
i just don't think it's for me.
really? i thought you'd be into it.
you know, helping with my conspiracy
to beat the system.
like pirates.
conspiracy pirates.
yep.
your mom's poor local
organic heart will just break.
it's her own fault.
remember that hardcore super vegan kid
anthony at your eighth birthday party?
oh, my god.
he chowed like 10 hotdogs
and then barfed
all over the carpet.
hey, is that the phone ringing?
i think moma's calling.
thank larry wallace
and all his naked people.
woo naked people
hell yeah
you mean you actually looked him up?
- who's larry wallace?
so, were you suggesting i fake
photos of my naked friends as an elective?
because i'm prelly sure that's illegal.
wait, who? the fuck
are you guys talking about?
i didn't even think about that.
well, i gotta go pick up
my teacher of the year award, so...
yeah.
what was that all about?
all right, come with me.
- i'm going to kensington with caitlin and gala.
it'll just take a minute.
right well, raymond
promised me a dark room.
great.
i think it hasn't been used for years.
dark room?
- yes, a dark room.
you know, like for photography
in ancient times?
and what's wrong with digital?
- no, if i'm gonna do this,
then i'm gonna do it properly.
i'm not a slacker.
wow.
well, wasn't the idea
just to get raymond off my back?
i don't recall saying
that you wouldn't have to do any work,
just that you didn't have
to be the next diane arbus.
right. diane arbus.
love her.
look her up.
well, of least we have
a spinning wheel.
no, make your eyes look more dead.
and don't do that with your lips.
just look bored.
if you don't like how i'm doing if,
then fake pictures of gala.
just don't pose so much.
i think you look hot.
ben was telling me
about this really awesome photographer
who takes pictures
of all kinds of freaks.
i heard that ben rides
a motorcycle.
i don't think that's true.
but he is in a band.
- look who's the ben expert.
yep, just like that, gala.
hey... do you ride o motorcycle?
no. why? should i?
i don't know, probably.
maybe we shouldn't look of this batch.
- you're like a boiling tea ketle.
what does that even mean?
i don't know, actually.
okay.
all right.
the moment of truth.
not too shabby.
of course, they'd be better
it they were in focus
and not overexposed,
but it's not like those are
the basic principles
of photography or anything.
not bad.
not one word, mom.
- okay, okay, i just think it's great.
that was seven words.
take my picture.
- can you turn your body info a pretzel?
i can try.
see? you're a natural.
i think it'll be very cool
to have a photographer
in the family.
- mom!
just saying.
- you'll want to cut down
on the practice there, monkey.
your body's starting to look weird.
wanna come see heidi slater?
- yeah!
see ya.
isn't she something?
what are you doing here?
- my dad's over there.
she's gonna be the next feisf, apparently.
- oh, thank god for that.
we need a new one.
do you think your dad
could introduce us?
and you could do your english homework
of the bar while you wait.
i actually have some work to do
in the dark room.
dude, i scored some pot cookies.
it's not exactly how i want
to spend the afternoon either,
but i have to pass.
save me a cookie!
- lame! you're lame!
favourite food?
sushi
very sophisticated.
yeah.
what's your real favourite food?
sushi
what's your real favourite f--
- okay, nachos!
that's what i thought.
keep doing that.
favourite place.
the island, probably.
that's specific.
toronto island.
you don't know?
it's just across the lake,
but it's like another planet.
raymond must love that.
- you know it.
there's a lot of great stuff there, like...
a lame amusement park.
i love lame amusement parks.
- yeah.
we should go there on a field trip.
i'm tired of taking photos of my friends.
i'm tired of your friends.
and there's a lot of little cottages,
and no cars,
and beaches,
and a ferry.
i love ferries.
who doesn't?
we should just go there right now.
yeah... probably not kosher.
it's for the good of my art.
you'd be saving me
from my fated starbucks.
it's not even really a big deal.
i didn't realize
you were such a conformist.
so, what's your favourite band?
- i'm not telling you that.
no, you'll just totally judge me.
as if. come on, who is if?
probably...
the ghost buttons.
that's a mode-up name, isn't it?
so, what happened to your band?
how'd you know i was in a band?
google.
googled me, huh?
boring story.
the industry's just terrible these days.
- that sucks.
yeah, i wish i could import that
to the fabulous students of phoenix.
you can be as wonderful and talented
and unique as you like, but...
if doesn't mean
your dream's gonna come true
just 'cause everybody says
you can do whatever you want.
raymond would spontaneously combust.
maybe you just weren't that good.
- probably.
anyway, teaching is a noble profession.
i guess you could always play
guitar in the subway for change
if that doesn't work out.
yeah, you could drop an elective
so you'll be right there with rne.
not me. haven't you heard?
i have the iq of a genius.
they probably just added up
the scores wrong.
you know, this place...
it's not half bad.
oh, my god, no.
do not bother. waste of film.
okay.
you probably shouldn't develop those.
she's going to parkdale.
there wasn't a phone anywhere.
- well, maybe...
you should've called before you went
to the island alone in the dark.
hey, aiden.
jesus, enough already. go to bed!
it wasn't dark when i went,
and... if i had a cellphone, this...
wouldn't be an issue.
- i expect more from you.
why?
- well, maybe it is time
we got her a cellphone.
- daddy...
molly...
don't make plans for a while.
whoa, what?
since when are you,
like, an authoritarian?
what? when?
- shut the front door.
i'm really sorry. fucking streetcar.
i actually waited for three full ones
to go by, and tell me you haven't read
savage love yet.
we were waiting for you, duh.
where were you yesterday?
gala broke up with andy.
- what? why?
i thought you were obsessed with her.
- she was just such a girl, it was annoying.
so, where were you?
i actually went to the island
to fake some pictures.
but with who?
no one.
- you went by yourself?
okay, well, actually--
- i can't believe
you ditched us to be a loner.
well, i did get grounded.
can you believe that?
marilyn grounded you?
- what about the egg castles show?
you know, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess
if you'd just come over.
come on, sit.
"relax and you'll squirt."
what?
how's ben working out?
- photography?
yeah.
- yeah, i really like it.
oh, beautiful. we need someone
to document the crazy energy
happening around here these days.
that's me.
the media is filled
with negative gender stereotypes.
for example, women are expected
to be small and graceful,
while men are expected
to be fall and broad--
you guys did it here in town?
- hey.
when are we gonna meet again?
i developed two rolls but i don't--
yep, i'll get back to you on that,
molly.
if you'd just fake your seat
you're a little bit late.
yo, who's the babe?
...i'll interduce you, and just...
- yeah.
okay.
all right, so i've got something
really cool for you guys today.
this is jordon dunhill.
she's a filmmaker, here, in toronto,
and she's gonna show us
her ultra-modern take on macbeth.
trust me, you guys
have never seen macbeth quite like this.
thanks, ben.
you're pretty lucky
to have this guy as your teacher.
now, it's a bit shocking in parts.
for example, macbeth is played
by marian smithley, a woman.
hey there. how was your day?
fine.
- just fine?
no, mom, it was the best day of my life!
can i go to this talent night thing?
that sounds like torture.
it's a school... yeah.
it's a s-school activity,
so yeah, yeah, i guess so.
so that means she can come
to the egg castles, huh?
well, no, she's grounded.
but you just said i could go
to talent night.
because that's different;
it's not a concert.
egg castles are way more talented
than anyone at my school.
i gotta go.
i know that you need
your privacy more these days--
mom.
how many of these tolks
do we really have to have?
well, i was prelly clueless
about my own sexuality
for a very long time,
which affected my self-esteem,
which led to bad decisions, and--
- like what?
and that's another conversation.
you may not want to talk to me
about anything.
but"...
we're going to planned parenthood,
and you're going to get the pill,
or the ring... actually,
there's a lot of options out there now,
and you can just talk to the doctor about it.
- i'm no': having sex.
you're acting different.
anything you wont to talk to me about?
- no.
maybe this will help.
dinner's almost ready.
oh, god. really?
you're in for a treat.
just kidding.
it's gonna be really uncomfortable.
so, you want to go on birth control?
my mom wants me to,
even though i'm not!
...you know, having sex.
do you have a boyfriend?
- i like someone.
but... it's compli...
it's complicated.
well, i can prescribe you
birth control,
but if doesn't mean you have to go have sex
all over the place.
i'll try not to have sex
all over the place.
well, i mean, what would you do?
would you fell him you like him,
or what?
well, i'm prefiy straight forward,
so... i'd probably
let him know somehow.
you printed photos.
so, how are you doing?
good.
great.
how's jordan?
jordan?
yeah.
she seems... interesting.
yeah, you would think that, right?
i mean, her parents are actually,
like, carnies from the circus,
but she is extremely dull.
it's the weirdest thing.
you know how to make
your contact sheet yet?
so, caitlin made me...
promise to check out
that ridiculous talent night.
i thought i'd take some photos.
so many precious snowflakes
in one room.
it's like a blizzard.
wow!
so, who's next?
- ben should play something.
no, molly, i think this is
a student talent night,
so maybe you should
demonstrate your skills.
yeah, but photography
doesn't translate to the stage, so...
come on, ben! don't be lame.
- yeah, come on, ben. don't be lame.
go, ben!
okay, well, i should probably
apologize in advance.
here's a song
by some city mates of yours.
okay, now he is sexy.
maybe i should go for it.
i'm not gonna lie to you.
it was a great show.
- this is the worst easter ever.
well, of least your sentence is over.
hey, i had a drink
with your english teacher last night.
you had a drink with ben?
- he's young, huh?
you kids must eat him for breakfast.
what did you guys talk about?
- oh, you know,
how shit the music industry is, the usual.
seems like a good guy, though.
did he mention me?
- yeah.
he said you are super cool.
really?
anything else?
well, i don't remember the entire
conversation verbatim, molly.
oh, your mom wants you downstairs
for the hunt.
seriously?
'morning, honey.
- good morning.
you gonna open up your clues?
don't you think i'm too old for this?
you might wont to look in the tub.
no! an iphone?
ls it for me?
i love you!
i want an iphone!
that's not fair.
who are you gonna call?
mozart?
i don't think he has a cell.
go get your lego. go play.
i'm gonna go meet gala and caitlin.
will you tell mom so she doesn't spaz out?
what about me spazzing out?
i'm gonna go meet gala
and caitlin, okay?
sure. you want a ride?
i'm going to pick up a cellphone for aiden.
yep, and next easter,
we can do firearms all around.
might be tricky to hide, though.
you look really nice.
say hi to the girls for me. okay?
okay
- okay
you look amazing.
wow. all grown up.
a'ight. see ya.
hi.
hey. i, um...
i just wanted to...
drop this off for you.
i didn't... think you'd be home.
was gonna put if in your... mailbox?
i love this guy.
i actually have something for you too.
just wait there one sec.
i was going to give these
to you at school.
i borrowed them
from an artist friend of mine.
wow. was it jordan?
-yeah.
so they're probably boring.
you can probably come in for a sec.
okay.
cool place.
sure, sit down.
okay.
i love these.
so, you're having a good easter?
yes. daddy gave me an iphone.
great. now you're gonna become
one of those texting demons.
i ran into your dad again.
i heard. how was that?
a bit bizarre,
to tell you the truth.
why?
no reason at all.
you know, molly,
i actually have to get going pretty quick.
yeah, me too.
i'm... meeting the girls.
so you were wallowing here in self-pity.
yeah.
drowning in scotch, actually.
so it's good i came by, then.
yeah, you're a real godsend.
hey. i am so sorry.
i got into a huge tight with my mom,
and i got held up.
so...
we talked to your mom.
she said you were with us.
so, where were you?
we were gonna leave without you.
well... i met a guy
at the streetcar...
at the streetcar stop, and...
we got to talking and,
you know... walking around.
i didn't even realize my ringer was off.
who is he?
his name's spencer,
and... he goes to parkdale.
okay, what's he like?
he plays the trumpet
ooh, a musician.
like it?
- yeah.
tell me, tell me.
- he's in the gifted program.
he's gifted?
- yep.
that's really great.
well, you should invite him over.
thai would probably, um...
end things pretty...
pretty quick.
- yeah.
yeah, i see your point.
oh, my god!
breakfast burrito?
no thanks.
- really?
hi.
hello.
oh, no. did i just ruin a print?
it's fine. i think i ruined that myself.
- no, no, you're killing it.
wow.
your brother is a remarkably flexible
young man.
are you okay?
i'm totally okay.
are you okay?
i'm... scared shitless,
to be honest.
rigth...
sorry.
you're something else,
molly maxwell.
is that a good thing?
no.
you're like a hand grenade.
all right, well...
keep up the good work, yeah?
if you want, you can...
come over later.
you're coming over, right?
- i can't. i'm meeting spencer.
when do we get to meet this guy?
soon.
do you have a date with that new girl yet?
yeah, but i'm not sure she's my type.
you should take a photo of him
and send it to us.
i'll try.
i'm pretty sure it's colder
in your apartment than it is outside.
an iglo would be warmer.
- yeah, you're probably right.
iglos are amazing because
the snow insulates them
and then your body heat
warms them up.
is that so?
- yes.
well, it's also a fact people are warmer
without their clothes on,
in a sleeping bag, or...
a duvet.
that's a fact, is it?
you have some photographs
to show me?
what?
- i-i'd love to see some of your photos.
sure.
yeah...
this one's lovely.
did you have to burn in this corner?
yep. dodged a bit there too.
wow. burning and dodging.
- i know.
your mom looks ecstatic.
you don't really want to spend
the afternoon looking ot photos of my mom.
clothing stays on.
okay.
and then i said, "richard,
you can't possibly go in there.
i already gave him
seven bananas!"
not bad.
i don't want to go.
so just...
you should stay.
at least until the search party finds me.
-yeah.
i could build a little dungeon
for you somewhere.
that was too far.
i'd just need a trickle of daylight.
he's not even stopping
to eat anymore?
he did. saves a lot of time
when you don't chew.
sit. come on.
tell me all about your date with spencer.
i'm really tired.
i'm just gonna go to my room.
you want me
to get this developed?
what? no.
don't go through my stuff.
clean your own sheets then.
it could be cool, i guess.
maybe they'll be more inspired
if it's something that they can relate to.
i mean, if you made the assignment
info an iphone app,
then maybe you'd have something.
you turned me into a precious snowflake.
isn't that enough?
right. maybe i should use
that stellar technique
with the rest of the class.
shit, gotta go.
hey. who you talking to?
aunt suzy.
oh. want to go to a secret
joel plasketi concert?
i'm not really
into joel plasketi that much.
no? i thought you were.
we could have a guitar hero marathon.
i kind of have a ton
of homework, so...
okay.
hey-
okay.
today, we're going to be starting
our poetry unit.
so, m, you get a boyfriend,
and you just decide to peace out?
no, i've just been really busy
with photo.
but all of you guys
actually listen to poetry
every single day in a sense...
on your ipods.
so, we're going to start
this unit by looking at songs
as modern-day poetry,
then we're gonna write our own.
what are some of your favourite songs?
- lady gaga.
the wordsworth of pop.
- this is so lame.
great anybody else?
- i like the zombies.
starr?
very nice to see you awake.
any song in particular?
i don't know the names
of the songs.
okay. well...
- so, have you guys done if yet?
no!
told you so.
yeah, pick a song,
write down the lyrics,
we'll meet back here
and discuss it.
okay?
holy shit!
so, did you get out
to the tiger rod show last night?
no. i had a stack of papers to grade.
oh, that's a shame.
it was epic.
dad, you're too old to say "epic".
oh, look who's too cool
for her dad now, huh?
please don't embarrass yourself.
so, ben...
well...
molly's... assignments
and her class attendance
have been much more consistent.
good. that's great.

is going brilliantly.

in the dark room already.

yeah.
molly...
these are so good.
oh, yeah. that one's great.
you should be doing my band photos.
maybe we should just get you
info a summer camp--
- okay, can we please go?
couldn't you have pretended to be sick
or something? i mean, for christ's sake.
i tried. i'd have to be on my deathbed
for her to miss a conference.
all right, right now,
where are you supposed to be?
homework at alice.
seriously?
so, you think your parents
will accept me into the family now?
my dad wants to marry you himself.
you know, 200 years ago,
no one would have any problem
if i took you as my child bride.
cleopatra was, like,
ruling egypt when she was my age.
is that even true?
- yeah.
i think you'd make a great pharaoh.
hey. clothing stays on.
i'm not taking them off.

wh-what?
i don't know what i'm doing!

he's good. i think he's winning
some trumpet awards.
i should...

any day now.
- god, it's excruciating.
hey, ben,
where are your pyjamas?
oh, i forgot all about it.
shit...
by the wow-
hey-
i got the prerelease
of the new ghost buttons.
can you take your seat,
please, molly, so we can start'?
all right, so, i thought we could read
a few of your songs today.
anybody like to go first?
- me!
i dreamt i carved your initials
into my heart.
with each beat, they grew
and warped like a tree over the years.
i dreamed i carved your initials
into my heart.
with each beat--
- molly.
how long have you been in yhis class?
now you're gonna fuck around on your phone?
go see raymond.
- why?
because you're blatantly disrespecfing me--
- well, you're being an asshole.
get out.
what do you want me
to tell him, mr. carter?
you can fell him you're acting
like a spoiled brat.
he's crazy.
are your moons out of orbit today
or something?
ask ben. he just freaked out on me
for no reason.
your call is important to us.
please hold.
well, what do you think you did?
i don't even know.
hey, ben...
hey! i'm drawing here!
- i'm surprised
you're allowed to do anything else
with your precious hands.
mom! mom!
jesus. what?
molly broke my pencil!
- he threw it at me!
could've taken my eye out!
- god, molly. you've been home
for, what, two minutes?
you always take his side!
- you were supposed
to pick up aiden from piano.
he waited an hour
before they called me.
- isn't he old enough to get him a cellphone?
you're really acting
like a spoiled brol lately.
you're becoming a total bitch.
i'm literally gonna punch you
in the face if you don't leave now.
right, i'll show you, i'll start.
hi.
guess what?
alicia cast a sex spell on me today.
left a note on my desk.
is if working?
i don't know yet.
do you think i... seem different?
you're a jerk.
look, just... never wear pigtails
ever again.
promise me.
yeah.
hey, raymond.
- hi.
wow. look of all your photos.
this is interesting.
ben, can i have a word
with you in my office
when you're done here?
- i can come right now.
great work, molly.
raymond was asking questions
about us.
he sent me home.
- what? why?
what did he say?
- he was asking about the fight
and why we're spending
so much time together.
you're my photo advisor.
i could go to jail, molly.
i'm above age in canada.
i looked it up.
not if i'm your teacher.
look...
well, don't be surprised
if raymond wants to talk to you as well.
fuck me, he's gonna call your parents.
i'll just fell them you're my new talent.
- molly...
this is not funny.
but...
i can still come over, right?
i don't think so.
and i'm gonna need you
to clear out your phone as well.
if that's what you want.
i don't want to get you in trouble.
let's do it.
come on.
what if this is our last chance?
would you rather i lose it to some asshole
after a bunch of beer bongs?
is that really the only other option?
probably.
it just feels wrong.
i don't see the difference
between this and the other stuff.
well, you might
when you're a little bit older.
nice.
condescending, or what?
don't be childish.
mommy and daddy
are probably looking for me.
wouldn't want to keep them waiting.
i need you to delete
those text messages now.
you okay?
supposedly,
she got a huge tattoo of a pentagram
on her back right above her ass.
what's up with that?
she is a witch.
her parents are witches foo.
it's like witch pride or something.
yeah, but a big witch tattoo at 16?
isn't that a little nutso?
god, i mean, why do people feel
this constant need
to shove their beliefs
down everyone's throat?
like mine?
you know, at least sierra
wouldn't stop being  witch
'cause some guy came around.
- yeah, she wouldn't, like,
ditch her witches.
i love the violin.
okay.
okay.
okay. okay?
all right? okay.
it's okay.
it's spencer.
you want to tell him you're okay?
don't
okay.
tic-tue.
you need some greasy brunch
to soak up that hangover?
go away.
ben carter has resigned.
what?
this isn't even on school property.
you want to talk about that?
i was practicing making a fake photo.
ben's superimposed.
- molly.
this isn't a fake photo, is it?
well, that doesn't prove anything.
molly, the fact is, leaving school
property with a student, alone,
without the permission of your parents,
is a serious enough offence just on its own.
we were just taking photos.
nothing happened.
what could have happened?
are you gonna bring out
the bad touching doll now?
give me a break.
- molly! show him some respect.
okay, look,
this happens all the time, okay?
in fact, just last week,
i met a girl your age
who was being taken advantage of
by her basketball coach.
she thought she was special,
thought she was the only one
he'd ever break the rules for.
turns out he'd done it four times.
no one took advantage of me.
we need to discuss if you and your parents
want to press charges
against ben carter.
- for-- no!
maybe we just need some time
alone with our... our daughter.
wait, wait, wait, not so fast.
mr. maxwell, we really don't have
any evidence if she doesn't cooperate.
who's spencer?
he's my boyfriend.
no, he isn't
i say we call this spencer
and see who? he knows--
- you know...
i don't think that's necessary.
- why not?
because i don't think
we should get spencer involved.
you know this spencer guy?
he goes to parkdale high.
he plays the trumpet
hey, molly.
so, is it true?
that's so fucking awesome.
totally knew, by the way.
didn't i tell you?
- no.
ben's like, what, 26?
why can't he get a girl his own age?
my parents are, like, 10 years apart.
my mom was, like, 18.
yeah, but she's 16.
i mean, she just got her braces off,
like, what, six months ago?
think he's done it before?
hey, your favourite movie's on.
that's not my favourite movie.
what are you talking about?
of course it is.
no, it isn't.
well, you're grounded,
so don't even think about going out.
okay.
did he take this?
yeah.
you look beautiful.
look...
i don't know this guy like you do.
but i do know that teachers aren't supposed
to mess around with their students.
you're a smart kid.
an amazing young woman,
actually.
you're gonna make your own mistakes.
you'll live.
call me if you need me.
or text me, or...
email me, or...
or write on my wall.
thank you.
okay.
you're here.
here i am.
your parents didn't barricade you
in your room?
my dad's actually probably
taking this opportunity to fit the locks.
how have you been?
you know...
relieved not to be in jail.
thanks for that, by the way.
- welcome.
i think you're gonna like
this first song.
it's called hand grenade.
ben, i just wanted to say
i'm really sorry.
sorry for what?
for developing the rolls.
and everything.
ain't no thing.
maybe we could get
something to eat after.
i don't think so.
yeah.
probably not.
i have to go now.
hi.
this is my first ever solo show.
and this is gonna be the first song
that i have ever written,
so i hope it's not too painful.
id?
- pardon me?
do you have any id?
- oh, i'm not drinking.
seriously?
- sorry.
