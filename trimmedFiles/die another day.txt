hey, murph, how you doing?
nice grouping, grandpa.
yeah, not bad.
is that it?
yep. we found him.
it's not good, john.
hospital or morgue?
worse.
when was the last time
you spoke to this kid?
it's been a while.
maybe a few years, even.
last time i saw him,
it was pretty ugly.
well, there's a few different
versions in there,
but my people are pretty sure he's
being held at a moscow prison
awaiting sentencing.
what's he charged with?
it's a nasty sheet.
he'll be lucky to get life.
he can never get
out of his own way.
he had a lot of problems.
he's still my kid.
i know.
but it's russia. they do
things differently over there.
me, too.
(chuckles)
good luck, poppy.

the 007 of plainfield,
new jersey.
very nice.
mcclane, shut up.
take it easy, oddjob.
i'm on vacation.
your mom will be pleased.
we thought you were
doing drugs or something.
mr. komarov.
or selling drugs,
but that was me, really.
do you have
the file on chagarin?
yes, or no?
it's very simple, yuri.
you give me the file,
and i get you out of russia.
and you're a free man.
what do you say?
it's not about me.
i don't care about my life.
well, that's the deal.
it's the only deal.
come on.
come on, yuri. help yourself.
what's it gonna be?
yes or no?
the clock is ticking, yuri.
come on.
you will get me out of here?
only the three of you?
whoa, nijinsky.
i'm not in the gang.
i just got off the plane.
i'm still jet-lagged.
i'm not involved in this.
huh, jack?
only if i can take
my daughter with me.
chagarin's people
will kill her.
fine. make it quick.
ah.
where's the file?
it's in a vault in prypiat, but
the key is here in moscow.
at hotel ukraina.
shit.
make your call. we're going
to the ukraina, let's go.
(line ringing)
<i>it's papa..</i>.
(daughter speaking russian)
<i>i'm fine, sunshine...</i>
<i>...we'll talk later.</i>
<i>listen.</i>
<i>i'll be waiting for you
where your mother and i shared our first dance.</i>
<i>now.</i>
<i>hurry! hurry! you understand?</i>
(ends call)
mike, listen, i'm sorry
about this morning, man.
it's fine.
okay, let's go.
contact!
down! get down!
go! get down! go, go, go!
(yelling in russian)
jack: john, cover!
come on, buddy!
go! go!
(beeping)
that's right, jerk-off!
all right, let's move, john!
i'm on fucking vacation!
come on, time to hustle.
watch your head.
mcclane, move it.
get down, yuri. stay low!
head down.
come on. go, go!
(rapid gunfire)
safe house, my ass.
he knows how old we are, no?
come on.
here, here, here.
sit down.
you're all right.
let me look at you.
(grunting) it's all right.
you're fine.
what are you doing?
jack.
calm down, yuri, okay?
you're gonna be just fine.
here, put this on, stay warm.
what was that, john? five minutes?
five minutes?
you blew a three-year op
in five minutes!
you're welcome!
what do you want me to do?
unbelievable.
i'm so fucking burned. i got no
friends in this town anymore.
what about your people at langley?
just give them a call.
give me your phone.
(phone shatters)
it's a two-year contract
on that phone.
what are you carrying?
give me that.
all right.
you got any cash on you?
some american money.
what are you talking about?
we need to keep on moving.
we have to get this guy to a doctor.
to medical attention, jack.
the mission stands.
your mission is
bleeding out over there.
the mission continues.
we go to the hotel.
come on, let's move.
let's move.
this is nuts.
what, are you going to go out
and kill somebody else now?
why all this trouble
for just one guy?
he's a political prisoner.
not that you care, john,
but it's a matter of national
security, all right?
he's got the goods to stop viktor
chagarin, and we need that to happen.
well, great, jack.
let's drop him off at the
embassy, and we can go home.
are you kidding me? after what
happened at the safe house?
look, it doesn't work
like that, all right?
it's a huge diplomatic mess,
and i'm a burnable asset.
so, i now need that file
to un-fuck this mission.
any more questions?
yeah, just one.
how come you never called
and told me where you were?
like you'd give a shit.
shit.
well, we're not going in the front door.
all right, hold up, hold up.
okay, yuri, listen to me, all right?
we're almost done.
as soon as we get that key,
we're gonna grab the file,
get you and your daughter
out of russia, all right?
all right.
listen to me, you're doing good.
all right?
i need you to hang here a second.
keep an eye on him, john.
hey, hey.
what is it with all this "john" shit?
whatever happened to "dad?"
good question.
in russia, we have
word for men like him.
<i>"krutoi."</i>
it means "tough,"
"hard."
in america, it means
"juvenile delinquent."
is he your only child?
no. i got a daughter, too.
you?
i have only my <i>solnyschka.</i>
when she was little,
i was working all the time.
i believed work was
all that mattered.
i screwed my
kid's life up, too.
you work all the time
around the clock most of the
time, when you're a cop.
i just thought that working all the
time was a good thing, you know?
i didn't help him at all.
it's never too late,
i hope.
okay, let's go.
all right, yuri, which part of
the building is the ballroom in?
main tower.
main tower.
which floor?
top floor.
what about security?
you remember any guards?
cameras? anything like that?
i don't know.
well, i need you to remember.
i was in prison for five
years, how should i know?
everything could have changed.
i know.
just think, all right?
picture it in your head.
the ballroom was closed in '89.
i think it's under
construction now.
jack: so that floor's
unsecured.
komarov: i don't know! listen!
my daughter is in there.
i'm scared to death, let's go!
(whistles)
just calm down, yuri.
(beeps)
(elevator music playing)
(elevator bell rings)
i guess you have
done that before.
smart.
i could have done it.
(elevator bell rings)
irina?
irina?
irina?
papa.
irina.
papa!
(speaking russian)
that's tender.
really? i wouldn't know.
(speaking russian)
need a hug?
we're not really
a hugging family.
that's right.
<i>we just have to get one thing...</i>
<i>...and then we're leaving moscow for good.</i>
<i>ok?</i>
<i>ok.</i>
<i>who are they?</i>
the young one works for cia.
the old one is his father.
americans.
<i>then thank god for them.</i>
there's something
no good about this.
just shut up, all right?
i'm telling you, jack,
this smells bad.
just stop, okay?
this might seem like a totally
foreign concept, you know?
i know you love to just
run in, making shit up.
but like any professional,
i have a plan.
so let's just
stick to it, okay?
just move your plan along.
all right, yuri, come on. let's
grab the key, get out of here.
yes.
just take a moment.
how you doing?
fine.
how did you get
over here so quick?
well...
i took garden ring.
oh, the garden ring. supposed
to always be bad, right?
(grunts)
hey, john.
did you get stuck in traffic?
i have it! i have it.
welcome, americans.
(gasps)
put your goddamn
guns down, asshole!
(shushing)
<i>papa, what is going on?</i>
give me your weapons.
come and get them.
(laughs)
really?
really.
papa.
yuri.
do it.
i thought you were
a problem child.
this a part of your plan,
mr. professional?
<i>what are you doing?</i>
<i>it's about money, papa...</i>
<i>...millions of dollars.</i>
<i>you think life was easy for me?</i>
<i>while you were sitting in prison being a victim?</i>
but.
i'm your father.
and i am your daughter.
we should kill the old man now.
we still need him.
but then you can kill.
thank you.
hi.
i don't know if i'm
saying this right.
hi.
do you know what i hate
about the americans?
everything.
especially cowboys.
i could have been a dancer.
i swear to god.
but nobody supported me.
you two
have been such a
pain in the ass!
come on, come on!
i prefer dancing, really.
but killing is much, much better
than working in a grocery shop!
jesus christ!
(laughs)
nice one.
(grunts)
you guys. so arrogant.
it's not 1986, you know.
reagan is dead.
(chuckles)
(chuckling continues)
sorry. oh, god.
(chuckles)
what's funny there?
can't tell you.
it's not you.
i love these outfits.
you guys are looking good.
(all laughing)
that was enough, thank you.
(laughing stops)
let's dance.
come on! come on!
(men yelling in russian)
jack!
remember the last time we talked
just before you went away?
oh, no! no, no!
you're not gonna open up
to me right before we die!
no,
that's not your thing, john.
what's my thing?
fucking killing bad guys,
that's your thing!
you're not gonna die today!
go!
shit!
fuck.
we're finished, john.
(chattering in russian
on radio)
<i>i'm taking care of it now.</i>
jack: i can't believe this.
i can't believe this.
this is unbelievable.
jack. hey!
jesus!
come on!
let's get out of this building!
(mcclane coughing)
<i>where are they?</i>
come on.
<i>alik, that's it. we're done!</i>
<i>let's go!</i>
<i>break left!</i>
<i>copy, commander.</i>
(sirens wailing)
(cell phone ringing)
<i>do you have him?</i>
yes.
<i>and the file?</i>
<i>does he have it?</i>
<i>i need that file, alik.</i>
he's taking us to it.
<i>no more mistakes, alik.</i>
<i>and when you have the file...</i>
<i>...kill them both.</i>
yes, sir.
(coughing)
shit.
that was exciting.
yeah. loads of fun.
you wanna go again?
are you shot?
no.
no, i'm fine.
let me take a look at that.
it's fine.
oh, fuck.
i can't believe she betrayed
her father for chagarin.
i don't understand that.
someday you will.
kids.
what's our next move?
i don't know.
you don't know?
i don't know, all right?
i mean, i'm out of moves.
i don't know.
i don't know.
i screwed up.
i blew the mission.
well, then we're done, right?
yeah, we're done.
we're done.
we should just go home.
we'll stop by a little pharmacy
on our way out of moscow,
get you some merthiolate
or mercury
and fix up your
little scratches, here.
get you home.
get a little toy set.
get yourself a nice warm glass of
milk with a little bosco in it.
get your cia slippers.
all right.
what?
i get it.
what the hell are we gonna do?
what's in the file?
evidence on chagarin.
evidence about what?
chernobyl.
look, listen to me.
komarov and
chagarin used to have this
nasty little side-racket
going on back in the day.
they siphoned weapons-grade
uranium, got greedy,
caused the meltdown.
then, you know, they fell out.
former partners, bad break-up.
scumbags.
so, chagarin had
komarov thrown in jail.
you know, put him in a hole,
forget about him.
doesn't have to worry anymore.
so what happened to rescuesque?
well, he grew a conscience.
yeah, well, that figures.
listen, chagarin is bad news.
he's the real deal.
if we see this guy in control, we're
gonna see the whole thing fall apart.
i'm talking terrorism,
wmds,
nukes.
someone has to stop him.
well, that's what we do.
we go out to chiapep
and we do our thing.
our thing?
yeah.
we go out there
and kill a lot of scumbags.
what? you got
something better to do?
all right. pull it.
you're not gonna cry, are you?
just pull it.
everybody needs a good cry
once in a while, jack.
don't be ashamed.
pull it.
you remember that time when
you and ralphie mauser were gonna
have that house-painting job?
got your finger
caught in the ladder,
you cried for
about five, six days.
john, just pull it!
all right.
on three. here you go.
one, two...
(grunts)
good god.
jesus.
when was the last time
you had a tetanus shot?
you all right?
yeah.
we need a car.
atta boy.
back to work.
hey, watergate,
how's that lock coming?
almost there.
here, try these.
come on.
oh, stealing. that's nice.
real nice, john.
yeah, i'm up for the
father of the year award.
whoa.
(jack laughs)
all right.
how'd you know all of these
guns were gonna be here?
it's a chechen hangout.
owner doesn't like
guns in the club,
so these bozos leave
them in their cars.
you learn a lot in three years.
yeah.
you sleeping?
i was.
jet-lag.
jeez, when was the last time
we were in a car together?
drive home from trenton.
i had to bail you out for that
weapons charge.
yeah?
no, it was the fire thing,
right?
when you set south philly
on fire, you mean?
(laughing)
we had to take out a second mortgage
on the house to make your bail.
yeah, i'm sorry about that.
it was funny.
(laughs)
(laughs)
(sighs)
are we really
going to chernobyl?
yeah.
the chernobyl.
the radioactive joint?
meltdown?
that's the one.
it's not the chernobyl
in switzerland, right?
with all the skiing and
the snow and everything?
you mean grenoble?
no, sorry,
we're not going to grenoble.
eddie collins's kid took
him on vacation last year.
they went down to boca.
oh, yeah?
spent four days at the track.
well, that's nice.
that's relaxing.
oh, yeah. sure.
we have to go to chernobyl?
yeah, sorry about that.
but all the radioactive stuff
is out, right?
<i>is it as you remember, papa?</i>
<i>i don't want to remember.</i>
<i>tough.</i>
<i>the file...</i>
<i>...is in the inner vault.</i>
very touching.
let's move.
which one is it?

as soon as they get in that
vault, komarov's a dead man.

partner got killed.

(lock disengages)
(rumbling)
alik: okay,

i'm losing my patience. the

komarov: radiation has been
pooling in this room for decades.
(irina laughs)
irina: you've underestimated
us, daddy dearest.
<i>bring it in!</i>
atta boy.
<i>come on! come on!</i>
irina: compound 27-4. it
neutralizes radiation, trust me.

of enriched uranium.

never was a file,
was there, yuri?
of course there was no file.
it was simply bait.
what i needed
was in this vault.
chagarin was
the only one with enough
power and influence
to get me out of jail.
i used him.
i used you.
it's about money.
when's it not about money?
you want to arrest me?
you're out of your jurisdiction,
detective mcclane, aren't you?
i wouldn't worry too much
about being arrested.

well, that makes you a "senior."
that's right.
try not to forget it.
i'm your father.
have some respect
for your father.
let me ask you something.
do you go looking for trouble
or does it always
just seem to find you?
you know,
after all these years,
i still ask myself
the same question.
(rock music playing)
<i>i had a dream last night
that i was piloting a plane</i>
<i>and all the passengers
were drunk and insane</i>
<i>i crash landed
in a louisiana swamp</i>
<i>shot up a horde of zombies
but i come out on top</i>
<i>what's it all about?</i>
<i>guess it just reflects my mood</i>
<i>sitting in the dirt
feeling kind of hurt</i>
<i>all i hear is doom and gloom</i>
<i>and all is darkness</i>
<i>in my room</i>
<i>through the light,
your face i see</i>
<i>baby, take a chance baby,
won't you dance with me</i>
<i>lost all that treasure
in an overseas war</i>
<i>it just goes to show you
don't get what you paid for</i>
<i>battle to the rich
and you worry about the poor</i>
<i>put my feet up on the couch
and lock all the doors</i>
<i>what's that funky noise?</i>
<i>it's the tightening
of the screws</i>
<i>sitting in the dirt
feeling kind of hurt</i>
<i>all i hear is doom and gloom</i>
<i>but when those drums</i>
<i>go boom, boom, boom</i>
<i>through the night</i>
<i>your face i see</i>
<i>baby, take a chance baby,
won't you dance with me</i>
<i>yeah!</i>
<i>baby, won't you dance with me</i>
<i>ah, yeah</i>
<i>fracking deep for oil but
there's nothing in the sump</i>
<i>there's kids all picking
at the garbage dump</i>
<i>i am running out of water
so i better prime the pump</i>
<i>i am trying to stay sober
but i end up drunk</i>
<i>we'll be eating dirt living
on the side of the road</i>
<i>there's some food for thought</i>
<i>kind of makes your head explode</i>
<i>feeling kind of hurt</i>
<i>yeah!</i>
<i>but all i hear</i>
<i>is doom and gloom</i>
<i>and all is darkness</i>
<i>in my room</i>
<i>through the night</i>
<i>your face i see</i>
<i>baby, take a chance</i>
<i>won't you dance with me</i>
<i>yeah!</i>
<i>come on!</i>
<i>baby, won't you dance with me</i>
<i>i'm feeling kind of hurt</i>
<i>baby, won't you dance with me</i>
<i>oh, yeah!</i>
<i>sitting in the dirt</i>
<i>baby, won't you dance with me</i>
