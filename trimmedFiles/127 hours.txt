[ woman ]
i don't know. i think we go that way.
[ woman #2 ]
but we went that way and had to come back.
- hey!
- whoa.
you're doing blue john too, huh?
uh, no, actually. we're headed for the dome.
- but i think we're lost.
- she's lost.
hang on.
- oh, my god.
- god.
- [ thuds ]
- [ grunts ]
let's see this.
you are... here.
- we are?
- mm-hmm.
- oh, yeah. i knew that. i knew that.
- [ chuckles ]
and the dome is there.
oh.
um, i can take you that way if you like.
uh-
<i>i’m sorry. the, uh- friday the 13th there.</i>

[ all laughing ]
i’m only a psychopath on weekdays.
and today's saturday, so-
can't take this off. it’s my face.
[ laughing ]

[ clears throat ]
- aron.
- kristi.
allow me to introduce
you to my friend megan.
- nice to meet you.
- it’s an honor.
- [ laughs ]
- what do you say?
you're lost. i’m a guide.
i’m good.
- [ megan ] why not?
- sure.
all right. this way.
[ megan ]
you biked from horseshoe, huh?
what is that- like, 20 miles?
[ aron ]
seventeen on the odometer.
- oh. oh. i thought it was 17.2.
- [ laughing ]
uh, 17.3 actually.
[ laughs ]
ah, you're one of those.
i’m not one of those.
do you spend a lot of time out here?
it’s my second home.
ah, see?
there's the fork right there.
aah. okay, totally missed that.
- glad we bumped into you.
- yeah.
[ megan ] what are the odds,
considering we're all the way out here?
exactly. you go to the
one place in america...
you're pretty much guaranteed
not to run into a weirdo...
- and what happens?
- [ laughing ]
- [ sighs ]
- all right.
so the guidebook says
that the route's through here.
but i know a better way- the cool way.
[ laughing ]
guaranteed best time you can have
with your clothes on.
although it's better with your clothes off.
[ murmurs ]
it is a bit of a climb.
[ together ]
we climb.
- and a bit of a squeeze.
- we squeeze.
[ kristi, megan panting ]
[ megan ]
so you get us all the way back in here...
and then you tell us that
you are not a guide.
well, no. i’m an engineer.
but this is what i really want to do.
oh, that's wonderful.
i've always wanted to be a supermodel...
but i don't think that's actually
really gonna work out, you know?
jesus, what if these things move?
they've been here for millions of years.
they're not gonna move.
- oh, sure they will.
- what?
- yeah. everything's moving all the time.
- oh!
let's just hope not today.
oh. great.

is that everything will be okay.

uh.
it’s monday. um.
bummer, all day.
i tried to set up this pulley all morning...
but it didn't work.
it was worth a try.
but there's too much friction.
and it's a climbing rope,
so there's too much stretch.
what i could really use...
is about 20 meters of
static wrap rope, 9.8 mil.
uh, three or four pulleys...
a rack of carabiners, a sling...
power drill... and bolt kit.
oh, and, uh, eight burly men
to do all the hauling.
that should just about do it.
i have, uh...
about 150 milliliters of water left...
which should keep me alive
till tomorrow night...
if i’m lucky.
i peed twice.
almost pissed my pants.
uh, i don't know,
my body's acting really weird.

[ sniffs ]

- smells really bad.</i>
but, uh, i’m sure it'll settle.
it’s got to be chilled like sauvignon blanc.
no number twos.
which should disappoint my insect friends.
they'll just have to wait.
let's see, what else could i tell you?
- um-
- [ raven squawks ]
<i>there's this raven that comes every morning.</i>
hey.
<i>i clocked it at 8:17.</i>
<i>i’ll- i’ll film it for you tomorrow.</i>

<i>i get 15 minutes of sunlight.</i>
<i>it's really nice.</i>
i have been chipping away.

they'll put a 24-hour hold on it...
