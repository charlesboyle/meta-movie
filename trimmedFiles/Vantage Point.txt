<i>good morning, america.</i>
<i>it's now 12 noon
in salamanca, spain.</i>
<i>in a short time, world leaders
from over 150 countries...</i>
<i>...meet here in plaza mayor...</i>
<i>...to sign up to president ashton's
bold new counterterrorist strategy.</i>
<i>since 9/11, more than 4500 people
have been killed...</i>
<i>...in the rising tide of global terror.</i>
<i>those lives will not
soon be forgotten...</i>
<i>...as today, the world comes together
to take a stand against this violence.</i>
<i>we may be on the brink
of a historic agreement...</i>
<i>...between western
and arab leaders.</i>
<i>security services are on high alert
in salamanca...</i>
<i>...where we go live to our news team
and our reporter angie jones.</i>
five, four, three, two...
i am standing inside plaza mayor
in salamanca, spain...
...where crowds have lined up
for the kickoff of...
<i>...what is without question
a landmark summit.</i>
<i>for months,
president ashton's been working...</i>
<i>...with leaders
from five continents...</i>
<i>...to forge a new groundbreaking
alliance in the ongoing war on terror.</i>
<i>and now here, today...</i>
<i>...western and arab leaders
will meet for the first time...</i>
<i>...to formalize this new coalition...</i>
...designed to once and for all...
...put a stranglehold
on international terrorism.
- bring him up.
- cue mark.
<i>- tell us, angie, what's the mood like?
- for the most part, hopeful.</i>
<i>everyone here is very
sympathetic to those...</i>
<i>...who lost loved ones
in the recent bombing.</i>
<i>i did, however, speak to delegates...</i>
what's she doing?
<i>...both of whom took a hard line,
suggesting that u.s. foreign policy...</i>
kevin, shut her down.
<i>...has to bear some responsibility
for the recent events.</i>
<i>thanks, angie.
you'll have to keep us informed.</i>
<i>- what the hell was that?
- not everyone loves us, rex.</i>
why don't you leave the punditry
to someone paid to have an opinion?
<i>i'm cool with censorship.
i know the american people love that.</i>
<i>- come on, angie. lighten up.
- got it.</i>
<i>- gallery.
- pass me over.</i>
- bruce.
- yes.
<i>- what was that? stick to the script.
- i told her. wanna tell her?</i>
<i>- fine.
- that's fine.</i>
- who is the clown on two?
- two is luis.
camera two, are you gonna move?
we're here for the summit,
not the sideshow.
man, it's like training
a freaking dog.
okay, everybody,
the president is about to arrive.
when he does, we're on him.
let's get our ducks in a row.

why didn't we know he was here?
shit, grace. we should've had this.
yeah, i don't...
- kevin, pull the archives.
- pull the archives, please.
the president's approaching
the plaza. all cameras ready.
angie, we're back in 20.
and remember, we're here
for the summit, not the sideshow.
<i>- there are other stories.
- i don't give a shit.</i>
unless the protesters set themselves
on fire, they're not our story.
- kevin, you got it?
- yeah.
check this out.
this was only last year.
i can't believe he's back already.
if we're the only ones
who have this...
he won't talk. a year ago we had hill,
we had that guy who saved reagan.
- mccarthy.
- all of them.
a hero piece.
barnes wanted nothing to do with it.
that was then.
it's a shame. it would've made a great
side story. we've no time to work it in.
that was then, this is now,
okay, guys? we've got our story.
okay, cue graphics.
camera five, give me a single.
- here comes the mayor.
- three, four, ready at the podium.

- two, give me crowds.
- de soto speech ending in one minute.
camera five, give me something else
to work with. that's good.
angie, when this is over,
i want a 15-second fill to wrap it up.
<i>- keep it simple.
- you mean dumb it down?</i>
get off it, angie. come on.
she's unbelievable.
<i>i offer you my city...</i>
the mayor's done in five.
ready with the graphics.
<i>this summit could be the
defining moment of his presidency.</i>
pull out, four, three...
oh, my god.
<i>the president appears
to have been shot.</i>
<i>- shit.
- i heard two shots...</i>
<i>- ... and the president fell.
- who's that guy?</i>
what's he doing?
okay, five, stay with that guy.
everyone else, give me ashton.
three, stick with the president.
just stay with him.
that's good. just stay with him.
stay with him. hold it there.
this is insane.

<i>- camera three, do better.
- they're not letting me through.</i>

<i>okay, you got him?</i>
<i>- what was that?

<i>angie? please, tell us
what you're seeing.</i>
<i>- deep breath. go.
- the president of the united states...</i>
<i>...has been shot.
there have been several gunshots.</i>
<i>it appears there was also a bomb
that went off outside the plaza.</i>
<i>there are people running scared...</i>
oh, shit!
mark?
mark, you gotta fill.
<i>it seems that a huge bomb...</i>
oh, my god. angie! angie!
<i>at the moment,
smoke from the explosion...</i>
<i>...mercifully covers the extent
of the human carnage.</i>
<i>there must be many people dead
and injured.</i>
<i>- angie.
- this truly is terrible.</i>
come on, kiddo, get up.
get up.
kevin, pull the feed.

when do we think
the changes will be ready?
it's not like i have to make
a speech now.
i could just wing it. how much trouble
could i really get myself into?
thanks. nice to know
we both know my limitations.
- we're stopping?
- yes, sir.
rick, i'll call you back.
the nsa's just confirmed the threat.
<i>- control, handoff complete.
- roger, point man.</i>
where's phil?
the hotel.
he's on with the joint chiefs.
he's sending the double, isn't he?
yeah.
we're moving potus to the hotel.
control, we've n.d.'d the car.
potus is returning.
we issue a statement that we're
deferring to prime minister gutierrez...
deferring, that's great.
<i>control, eta to castle
is two minutes.</i>
today of all days.
christ.
sir, we've used doubles
since reagan.
that was for photo ops.
not for anything this big.
<i>control, we have potus
and we are moving to the castle.</i>
<i>eagle has arrived at the plaza.</i>
<i>control, we have potus
and are entering the castle.</i>
- sir.
- talk to me, phil.
nsa called it five minutes ago.
it's real.
and the summit? you're not
thinking of pulling out entirely?
why would we?
do we know who's behind this?
a local group with a vague connection
to the mujahedin brigade.
- why issue the threat now?
- u.s. special forces...
...uncovered a plot to smuggle
a bomb out of morocco.
we took their bomb and their men,
and this may be their retaliation.
you think trying to kill me
is a retaliation.
potus is moving.
<i>safe for eagle to exit vehicle.</i>
<i>copy that.</i>
this is them?
that's benwar suarez. as near
as we can tell, he leads the group.
and what do we know about him?
he's from morocco,
educated in paris.
he went off the map for awhile,
but he surfaced in beirut, darfur.
couple days ago we intercepted an
e-mail between members of his group.
embedded in it were links to maps,
blueprints of the area.
it was this morning
that we received the threat.
the joint chiefs,
what do they recommend?
that we go after their leadership.
here in spain?
morocco.
we have a satellite lock
on one of their camps there.
you want me to call in a strike
on a friendly arab nation?
they're harboring terrorists.
- and this intel, we're certain...?
- absolutely.
control, we're clear on seven.
why not focus on the ones
who are here actually doing this?
this summit is too important.
but we're looking for five people
out of 6 million. we are trying.
try harder.
<i>ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the united states:</i>
<i>president henry ashton.</i>
a wonderful day. some words now.
welcome.
<i>this is a wondrous day.</i>
<i>today, we make history.</i>
<i>- he doesn't even look like me.
- senor presidente...</i>
<i>...fellow members
of the european union...</i>
<i>...president ashton...</i>
<i>...and citizens of the world...</i>
<i>...it is with great pleasure that
i invite you all to our humble city.</i>
is that thomas?
yes, sir.
i thought he was still inactive.
he was.
well, if he's back,
why isn't he with me?
we weren't sure if he was ready.
- you sent him out there.
- we need someone to sell the double.
sell? he took a bullet for me, phil.
and look at him.
he hasn't stopped
punishing himself since.
i liked him every bit
as much as you did.
but we needed to know
we could count on him again.
so you threw him out there
to see if he could?
that's how we treat
our friends now?
<i>therefore...</i>
<i>...i offer you my city,
my heart and my hope.</i>
<i>this summit could very well be the
defining moment of his presidency.</i>
jesus!
<i>the president appears
to have been shot.</i>
<i>i heard two shots,
and the president fell.</i>
get the joint chiefs on the line now.
admiral houston, it's mccullough.
have you seen the situation?
the president is secure.
<i>get him out of here!</i>
how long do we have to get
the birds in the air?
so you're ready to strike now?
mr. president.
sir.
mr. president.
the chiefs have a satellite lock
on their village. they're ready.
sir?
ted?
- there's an issue of when we can go.
- we go now.
you can't give the order.
you've been shot.
we go now, we risk telling the world
that you weren't there.
we weren't there, ted.
get the vice president to do it.
no, we are not going near
the 25th amendment.
tell rick to work up a story

bombing a camp in morocco will
blow this summit out of the water.
that is what the people
behind this want me to do.
mr. president,
we have to act strong.
no, we have to be strong.
they sent us a warning
because they want us to react.
they know our playbook.
they're banking on us doing
what we always do. we will hit back.
we have the world's sympathy
right now.
let's honor that. let's finish
what we came here to do.
okay, copy that.
everything is being prepared
to transport the president.
we need to get the president
to air force one now.
i'm done hiding.
