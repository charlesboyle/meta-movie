the window,
obviously, would be. . .
oh, hey,
principal betcher.
the window would
be the birth canal,
whereas the whole building,
that. . . that's your
mother right there.
you're late, again.
no, l was just. . .
l was just giving a lesson.
l warned you, if you
were late one more time,
l would dock you
a vacation day.
you were serious
about that?
oh, yeah, dead serious.
come on, pal.
l was teacher of the year.
that was 1 0 years ago.
feels like eight,
though, right?
you got bus duty today.
today, l can't,
'cause l, you know,
l volunteer down
at the youth center.
not true.
(students murmurlng)
okay.
everybody,
open up your books
to whatever we were
working on yesterday.
yesterday was sunday.
(students laughlng)
just get to work, okay?
(slghs)
mr. voss?
mr. voss, our textbook
says that
the discovery of penicillin
was the most important
biological discovery
of the 20th century.
but l read online
that this actually encourages
more potent strains
of infection.
yeah, that's some very
advanced, college-y stuff.
look, if you're done
with your work,
just go sit down and draw
on your desk like martinez.
but l want to know.
because if
the textbook is wrong. . .
malia, the chances
of you actually using
anything you learn
in this class,
probably zero.
and l don't know if you
heard mr. betcher or not,
but, technically,
this is my vacation time now.
so l'm going to shut
her down for a few.
(slghs)
(students laughlng)
(school bell rlnglng)
(lndlstlnct conversatlons)
oh, no, no, no, not today.
not today. come on.

marty: now, remember,
please, listen to each other.
help each other.
lnspire me.
this never happened.
we clear?
(orchestral muslc playlng)
marty: join in.
be together now.
here we go!
second violins,
don't overpower
the first violins.
that's why you're
called "second."
l hear improvement
coming in the door.
nice and subtle.
and you're done.
thank you.
mr. streb.
oh, right,
the quote of the day.
l forgot the quote
of the day. all right.
l think l'm going to go
with a rock star
of philosophers,
friedrich nietzsche.
and he said. . .
dan, drumroll, please.
(drumroll ends)
(students laughlng)
"without music,
life would be a mistake."
boy: nice.
(students murmurlng)
who's going to practice?
who's going to. . .
l don't believe one of you.
get out of here.
(school bell rlnglng)
you were great today.
mr. voss.
and what do l owe
the pleasure of this visit?
oh, the music.
l heard the music.
sounds great.
yeah.
they really bring the heat,
these kids, huh?
listen, l have
a huge favor to ask.
l have bus duty, and l was. . .
(cell phone chlmes)
okay, hold that thought.
l'm expecting this.
this. . .
see, the thing is,
my aunt cora,
she threw
her hip out again.
l'm so sorry.
yeah, it's nasty.
lt's a nasty
hip-out thing.
and these pins and rods,
they're not even
connected to anything,
they're just loose.
and l wouldn't
just ask anybody,
but l've seen how you are
with the whole
bus safety situation.
you handle it like. . .
l'm not going to. . .
yeah, l'm going to
say it, you have a gift.
and. . .
ls everything all right?
you teach biology.
you know the body.
what are the chances
of a 48-year-old woman
being pregnant?
well, it depends
what she looks like.
l'm just kidding.
that's more of
a fertility question.
my wife is pregnant.
no one knows.
lt's still very early.
please, please keep this
between you and me.
are you kidding me? that. . .
lt goes right in the vault.
that is locked.
locked away. wow.
thank you. thank you.
how old are you?
old.
oh. congrats, right? l mean. . .
well, yeah.
lt's beautiful.
l mean, my son is 22.
he just finished college.
l thought l was
done writing checks.
yeah.
l'm going to have a baby.
yeah.
(sobblng) l'm going
to have a baby.
oh, you went low.
okay. all right.
wow. and thanks
for the bus duty, doing that.
l really appreciate it.
you want the vest
on the chair
or just go with the. . .
l'm going to go
with the desk.
l'm just going to put
it on the desk, okay?
baby! we're having a baby!
baby!
can we take our seats,
people?
come on in.
we're about to begin.
please take your seats.
you believe this guy?
all right, we're sitting.
plenty of seats.
come on in.
how much food do you think
is stuck in that beard?
l don't know,
but l can see corn
from here.
oh, yeah. you dip that beard
in hot water, you got ramen.
hey, bella.
you know, l waited for you
for like three hours.
you waited? where?
the bowling alley.
we had a date.
no, we didn't.
you asked me,
and l said no.
no, it went. . . l said,
"lf you want to go,
just say no,
"and we'll both know
it's code for yes."
you didn't really go,
did you?
l did.
l waited for two hours.
you said three.
yeah, but, you know,
actually, it's pretty hard
to see your watch
when you've been crying.
okay, giving you
one last chance here.
you've already given me
how about this?
l swing by. . .
no.
(clears throat) heiio?
thank you, everyone.
as several of you
already know,
wilkinson high school
has been operating
at a budget deficit
for several years.
assistant principal elkins
and l have already conferred
with your union to try
to minimize the impact
on the classrooms,
but, unfortunately,
l have to make
some serious cuts.
starting immediately,
we'll be freezing
all supplies,
and, unfortunately,
we have to roll back to
last year's pay scales.
(teachers groanlng)
joke's on him. l didn't get
a raise this year anyway.
me, either.
(both chuckllng)
also,
despite best efforts,
we are cutting all
extracurricular activities,
which includes
the debate club,
the music program,
the annual senior
class field trip...
excuse me?
you're talking about cutting
the music program?
you're actually
going to cut music?
l'm sorry. we simply
don't have the funds.
no, wait a minute,
mr. betcher.
we're talking
about marty's job here.
how about all
the money we raised
in the car wash or
the silent auction?
miss flores, after expenses,
we only netted $750.
lt's a drop in the bucket.
"verbis defectis
musica incipit."
that's latin for,
"music takes us
where word cannot."
l mean, what about
the athletic program?
those football players, they
get new jerseys every year.
wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
are you trying to equate
your music program
with the football team?
are you aware that
the booster club alone
accounts for one-third
of our charitable donations?
this is a budget question.
and l just need
a little bit of that budget.
l've got 60 kids
with dented instruments.
marty, what's your point?
marty: music helps
the kids with. . .
with math.
the kids...
the kids don't raise money.
this is about a budget.
well, l. . .
l know how important. . .
you don't know.
take a seat.
come on. why don't you just
take it easy on the guy?
excuse me?
let it go. let it go.
just back off him,
and let's move on already.
why don't you not
tell me how to do my job?
okay, and then why don't
you tell him the truth?
this is how we got
thrown out of softball.
oh, and what would that be?
that you're cutting
the music program
so he loses tenure.
(scofflng)
that is ridiculous.
you are wasting
everyone's time.
really? you know what?
you're wasting my time.
okay, how does
a day without pay sound?
bring it.
really?
that's how you
show your power?
you already docked me
a vacation day.
oh! oh, so... so that's
what this is all about? hmm?
the decision's been made.
yeah, well, every time
you make a decision,
you know what,
you mess
with somebody's life.
you know what? you have
just crossed the line.
no, l'll tell you
what's crossing the line,
firing a man
who's having a baby.
(whlmpers)
(teachers murmurlng)
they don't know that
l'm talking about
you necessarily.
woman: congratulations.
stop looking at me.
they know it's you now.
he's having a baby.
scott, you're talking
about a lot of money.
money the school
just doesn't have.
a lot of money? really?
how much could
it possibly cost?
$48,000.
(teachers murmurlng)
so, as l was saying,
we have no choice
but to make these cuts.
yeah, or raise the money.
oh, and who's going
to do that?
we will.
(mouthlng) thank you.
l couldn't sleep
a wink last night.
my mind was racing.
and l bought you a coffee.
oh, and l spoke to elkins,
and he said we have to have
the money in by the end
of the school year, okay?
but then l made
some fliers,
and l thought
we would all meet. . .
all the teachers at
and you can give us
your game plan.
game plan?
yeah.
l'm still kind of
sorting through everything.
that's great.
so, what do you think
about this?
l thought l would
start out talking
about how important
music really is,
and then l would
tell some stories.
like, did you know that ravel
liked to dress up like a lady?
(laughs)
(stammers)
ls that too risqué?
you know, l think we should
probably just wing it.
okay, but you know what?
l have to thank you again.
l was driving in
this morning.
l heard i won't back down
by tom petty, and l said,
"yes, that is a sign."
wow, are you solid.
(school bell rlnglng)
okay.
okay. okay. 5:00.
what's going on?
where is everybody?
well, the meeting
doesn't start till 5:00.
lt's 5: 1 5.
well, then you're late,
like everybody else.
where do you think they are?
am l at the right place?
marty: yes.
you are, absolutely.
thank you so much
for coming, miss flores.
are you kidding me?
of course, marty.
you know
what l'm going to do?
l think l'm going to go
round up the other teachers.
they got to be somewhere.
maybe they thought
it was in the cafeteria.
l think l saw
some people there.
yes. l'm going to
try the cafeteria.
l'm feeling good
about this.
(door opens)
there's no one in
the cafeteria, is there?
just that janitor
that talks to himself.
l guess it was unrealistic
to think that
anybody would show up
when everybody has
their own problems.
you showed up.
you shut up.
l said, "you showed up."
oh. l guess
l'm unrealistic.
but l got to say,
it's really nice
what you're doing
for marty.
well, we tried, you know.
l mean, what are you
going to do?
what are you
talking about?
you can't give up
on him now.
he's so passionate
about what he does.
this school needs more
people like him, not less.
yeah, no, no,
l know, that's what. . .
no, l'm saying
that's what we got to do.
we got to find a way
to make this thing work,
and we got to stick at it.
so, what exactly
is the plan?
(slghs) well, first off,
we got to get $48,000.
that's a definite.
then we should probably help
save marty's job after that.
wow. l can see that you put
a lot of thought into it.
well, how about this?
how about we work out a plan,
but we do it in
a controlled area,
which is my apartment,
and we put up charts and. . .
with the graphs and
the colored pencils.
but we have a plan, we go,
"we got to get
to here by then."
not a chance.
okay, you're
making me work at this.
l understand. l get it.
what if l dunk this ball
in that hoop,
then you have dinner with me
at my house friday night?
what do you say?
(chuckles)
you dunk a basketball?
please.
fine. then take the bet.
deal.
where are you going?
oh, no, no, no, no, no.
come on,
that's cheating.
oh, no, it's not.
that's. . .
no, that's not what l. . .
your dreams are
about to come true.
nightmares.
(thud echolng)
(ball bounclng)
(groanlng) 0 for 1 7.

lt's got
an incredible kick.

eight.
you made this?
wait till you see
what kind of dreams
you have tonight.
so, listen,
you really have
no extra work?
l mean, power-washing,
painting, anything.
l'll take anything.
no, no one's hiring
right now.
l had to lay off
two guys myself.
bobby denisi
just lost his house.
lauren:
eric, tell mary shannon
to get off
the freaking phone!
mary shannon,
get off the freaking phone!
lauren:
l could have done that!
well, then why didn't you?
man, she's so lazy.
yeah.

but. . . hey, buddy?

to accomplish here?

lauren: and where

(slren walllng)
hey.
lf you need me to front you
a couple hunnies,
l can do that.
l got some money stacked away
that she don't know about.
look, l appreciate it,
but l need a lot more
than that.
you know what we could do?
we could bet
a five-game parlay
and take those winnings
right to the lndian casino.
mom, dad's betting again !
all right, guess who's
not getting a hamster.
what about that
citizenship class you
used to teach at night?
nah, that was so brutal.
l don't even know
if they're hiring.
no, no, you just relax,
you know.

announcer:
now, 1 0-car pileup.
(tlres squeal and loud crash)
okay, question number three,
"women such as
susan b. anthony
"fought for suffrage and were
finally successful in 1 920."
what does "suffrage" mean?
(group talklng ln unlson)
what's that?
group: . . .to accept
the things l cannot change. . .
okay, you know what?
that's the aa meeting
next door.
you know what,
let's let them
finish up
the serenity prayer.
(clears throat)
group: . . .accepting hardship
as a pathway to peace.
he will make all things right
if l surrender to his will.
that l may be
reasonably happy
in this life
and supremely happy
in the next.
living one day at a time. . .
scott: right,
one day at a time.
good for them.
okay, so "suffrage",
what does it mean?
miguel.
to be in pain?
no. okay, you know what,
that's "suffering."
"no, that's 'suffering."'
okay, no, you know what?
no, we're not
repeating today, muba.
thank you.
sorry.
lt's fine.
we're just not
doing it today.
we're just gonna do it
a couple times as a study aid.
sorry.
lt's okay, it's fine.
no, "suffrage" is
the right to do something.
the right to
not feel pain.
no.
okay, look, we covered this
for, like, 45 minutes.
you guys remember monday?
you guys remember monday?
when we went over
this for, like, 45. . .
the whole class dedicated
to this. you don't. . .
"suffrage" has nothing
to do with pain. no pain.
no pain, no gain?
okay, we're off track.
we are
definitely off track here.
the right to vote?
scott: l'm sorry,
you got something to say?
niko. but forget it.
l'm sure it's wrong.
please, look, there are
no wrong answers here,
people. you know what?
l'm gonna stop right there
'cause there are obviously
a lot of wrong answers,
but there are a couple
wrong answers, but. . .
lt's okay, there are.
but let's give
it a shot anyway.
the right to vote?
there you go. okay?
yes!
you know what, "suffrage" is
the right to elect leaders.
you understand,
right, miguel?
l do, l do.
okay, good.
mr. voss! mr. voss.
can l talk to you?
sure, what's up?
l always try to
be a good student.
but when it comes
to taking tests,
l get all clenched
in the tight spot.
lf l fail this
citizenship test,
they'll send me
back to holland.
and things here are
just starting to twist.
l'm sorry, is that good?
l don't even. . .
oh, yeah, yeah.
twisting is good.
so, l was wondering,
is there any way you can
give me a little extra help?
extra help?
yeah, you know what,
l kind of got,
like, a full plate
right now.
l can't, l'm sorry.
yeah.
all right.
thank you. thank you.
niko!
l'll move some things around
and maybe we can sit down

(laughs)

(on tv) hi, again, everybody.
l'm mike goldberg.
welcome once again
to the ultimate
fighting championship.
since the first day
he entered the octagon,
we knew ken dietrich
was something special.
my partner as always,
joe rogan.
man, what
an exciting matchup this is.
lncredible matchup, you know,
for a bunch of reasons.
(both speaklng dutch)
(speaklng dutch)
you hold for bets.
(speaklng dutch)
mlke on tv: ken dietrich,
brian stann, here we go!
(men speaklng excltedly
ln dutch)
joe:
straight left by dietrich.
he's jumping
all over stann.
he should just
double-leg him,
take him down.
did you ever fight?
no, no,
l wrestled in college.
that guy's a wrestler.
wrestlers make great fighters.
joe: and dietrich
jumps all over him again.
he's got the takedown!
all: oh !
you called it!
ooh, twisty!
twisty!
twisty!
twisty.
joe: and he has that
nasty shoulder-lock.
mike: and it is all over!
(crowd cheerlng)
ken dietrich,
the executioner!
sorry, koen.
ah ! he took his 1 0 grand
and ran off like
a shetland pony!
ten grand. . . he made
yep.
but he lost.
yeah, if he won,
it would've been 50.
okay, next fight.
(both speaklng dutch)
mixed martial arts?
do you even know
how to do that?
no. no, l do not.
this is crazy.
look, l saw this
ufc event last night,
and the guy got paid 1 0 grand
to fight, and he lost.
l was a really good
wrestler in college.
l think l can do this.
do what?
lose.
you cannot do this.
marty, look,
we only have until the end
of the school year
to save your job.
come on ! night school.
oh, great, yeah,
between what l make there
and what you make
with your private lessons,
we'll save the music
program in 1 8 years.
this is the best
chance you got.
okay.
okay, if you're gonna lose,
then l'm gonna help you lose.
deal?
deal.
let's do this.
let's lose.
scott: unfortunately,
today is gonna be my last day.
but don't worry,
next week,
you're gonna be
in great hands
with a new teacher,
and he's gonna be. . .
but you are new?
yes, l am new.
but this guy,
he's even newer.
understand?
so, you are not new?
no, l am new, okay. . .
l'm so confused.
l don't. . .
okay, we're going
off the rails again here.
okay, listen, everybody.
here's the point.
next week,
l am not gonna be here.
l will be gone.
but l wanted to say
to you guys good luck and. . .
you know what?
welcome to america
in advance.
yeah, that's how
confident l am in you.
live the dream.
make it happen.
so, thank you
and good night.
okay?
(class murmurlng)
so, l'm citizen?
man, l can't believe you
would quit on me like this.
l'm citizen.
you know how
important this is to me.
niko, relax.
l got it all worked out.
but l need to
ask you something.
okay!
here's the thing.
l need money
to save a friend's job,
a lot of money.
okay,
and as crazy as it sounds,
l want to fight
mixed martial arts,
but l need your help.
l want you to train me.
you're kidding?
no, l can do this.
you're too old !
and on top of that,
you have no experience.
but there are guys
that run marathons
well into their 80s.
not when they're
being punched in the face.
come on, you said it yourself,
wrestlers make great fighters.
and you know,
when l was younger,
l took judo.
l mean, it was only for
three and a half weeks.
l had to stop 'cause
my sensei got accepted
into dental school.
but he said l had
wicked potential, man.
there's no way
you can fight.
and that's the end of it.
okay, great.
what time are we
studying tonight?
you just quit!
look, you don't want to
train me, that's fine.
but we started this thing
and we're not gonna stop
until you're a citizen,
okay?
(slghs)
okay.
you want to be a fighter?
you start in the cage.
there's a small-time show
this weekend.
l'll get you in.
wait a second, no.
fight right away?
shouldn't we train first?
no! trial by fire, baby!
l'm a citizen.
you made my dream
come true.
miguel. . .
l'm going to name
my boy after you.
his name is sergio,
but l'm going
to switch it up.
that's nice, miguel.
let's slow things
down a second, okay?
and let's take
a little walk and talk.
something wrong?
maybe.
marty: ow!
ow!
come on,
l got to do this.
l know. okay, okay.
oh !
okay, hold it for a minute.
this is a terrible mattress.
l'm feeling everything.
this is ridiculous.
l'm not gonna learn
any of this stuff.
l'm telling you,
l'm just gonna wrestle.
l'm gonna take it
to the ground.
lt's my world.
your world?
your world is
gonna be destroyed
by people who know
multiple disciplines.
the fight's in two days.
what am l gonna learn?
lt is what it is.
l got it.
l know exactly
what you have to do.
you're gonna
beat your opponent
before the match
ever starts.
you're gonna learn
the ancient art
of intimidation.
you ever actually
been in a fight?
no. well, none with a boy,
anyway.
but l know
this is gonna work.
okay, so based on
your limited experience
fighting girls,
how?
music.
you're gonna be
inspired by music.
that's why
all the gladiators
entered the colosseum
with all that
thundering music.
actually,
they do that in the ufc.
exactly.
and you're gonna
follow in the footsteps
of all those
great warriors.
every one of them had
a distinctive musical theme
that put fear in the hearts
of their opponents,
which rendered
them defeated
even before
their match began.
l got it.
you could enter
with pachelbel.
no, l know
what l'm doing.
with bach.
l don't need that.
lt's gonna be. . .
l have it.
don't. . .
mozart's 35th in d major.
listen to me.
l'm picking the song !
of course you are.
(crowd cheerlng)
(men gruntlng)
good evening, sir.

that there would be
some place private,
you know, where he could
have a modicum of privacy. . .
(scott stammers)
no, no, no,
l'm doing this for you.
l appreciate it. . .
lt's embarrassing.
yes, it is. we're gonna move.

(chlcken clucklng)

(men speaklng lndlstlnctly)

a civil war hospital.
lookie, look who showed up.
you're not as smart
as l thought you were.
look, l knew this
wasn't gonna be the ufc,
but l'm 80 % sure
l saw a chick. . .
l think it was a chicken.
was it a chicken?
chicken.
lt's 1 00 %. . .

but he should be home
any minute.
here. please, come in.
thanks so much.
yeah.
you're welcome.
oh, it is such a mess.
l am so embarrassed.
marty's instruments

l can't believe
l just said that.
l'm expecting.
no one knows yet.

and it's like a,
it's like a vault,
locked down, fort knox
or some sort of prison.
great. thank you.
wow, does he play
all these?
oh, no.
he buys them off
the lnternet
and garage sales,
and he fixes them up
for students who
can't afford them.
oh, man.
just sucks what's happening
at school, doesn't it?
what do you mean?
what's happening
at the school?
he didn't tell you?
no. ls there something wrong
that's going on at the school?
no, no, nothing bad at all.
last week, they installed
a metal detector
in the teachers' lounge,
'cause. . .

flashed a piece, you know?
oh.

well, is there a message
l can give him for you?
you know what? no.
thank you. okay.
great.
lt was nice meeting you.

no, that was
disco street fighting.
don't worry, with you,
we're gonna do
the real stuff.
(popplng tongue)
(lmltates choklng)
that's what
we're gonna try.
let's go. l have

let's work on some
takedown defense.
l wrestled, l think l know
how to stop a shot.
ding, ding, boom, boom,
elbow, elbow, boom !
liver shot,
bang, bang, bang !
oh ! knockout blow.
you got the point.
we need to keep you out
of dangerous situations.
now, to escape
the rear-naked choke,
you want to
break the grip,
pull the arm down
and move to the side.
escape.
no, don't squirm.
that just helps me
sink it in tighter.
(groanlng)
arm bar. escape.
(exhales)
escape!
wrong way, wrong way.
too late.
(groanlng)
okay, you're vulnerable
like a puppy.
yeah, that's 'cause l
let you get into position.
lt's easy. l could do
the same thing to you
if l got you in a hold.
good point. yeah.
l'm out.
l'm free.
(groans)
l'm bored.
l'm late for my class.
we're just gonna

(women cheerlng)
(dance muslc playlng)
announcer:
ladies and gentlemen,
introducing the principals.

(cheerlng)
man: romero!
no helmet?
hey, it's okay
to be afraid.
don't worry. use it.
try to channel it
into focus.
that last knockout,

three migraines a week
say you're wrong.
hey, you got to. . .
you got to stop this.
why?
either dig in
or call it a day.
no, no,
l'm loosening you up.
no, you're not.
you're rubbing me like
you're putting on sunscreen.
get off!
lt is weird.
okay. l thought l was
doing the right thing.
and now, my friends,
let's meet his opponent
here at the pier.
this young man
is from boston,
massachusetts.

(boom playlng)
block those knees, scott!
block them ! block them !

(horn blows)
(crowd groanlng)
wait! he kicked him
in the bells!
ref, take a point!
(groanlng)
would you come on?
man, are you okay?
he just kicked my
left nut into my throat.
(groans)
where's my stool?
what stool?
you're in charge
of the stool.
we didn't have
a stool last fight.
l didn't make it out
of the first round last fight.
l'm a little confused about
my job description.
l'm a music teacher.
l don't know the rules.
l can't do this.
what are you doing?
you can't lay down. get up.
l'm exhausted.
yeah, that's
exactly the message
you're sending him.
hey, you can't
lay down, man.
can you continue?
he's fine.
hey, l'm talking to him.
all right,
let's go, fella.
get up, scott.

(gruntlng)
nice job!
okay, there you go.
pull him in close.
okay, that's right,
push him away.
don't look at me.
look at him !
(crowd groanlng)
(horn blows)
listen to me. you're giving
him too much space.
to take away his power, you
have to keep it in a clinch.
got it?
l'm trying.
defense.
stay strong, scott.
one more round.
(thunder rumbllng)
(raln patterlng)
(crowd groanlng)
(crowd murmurlng)
okay, it's raining.
lt's over.
no, it's not.
this isn't baseball.
you fight!
this is stupid.
(horn blows)
fighter, are you ready?
are you ready, chief?
l got to be honest,
l'm really not.
l'm out. l'm out.
yeah, yeah, he's ready.
(scott mumbles)
lt'll blow over.
referee: all right!

(sobblng)
hey, what's the. . .
what's the matter?
my father is
making me quit music.
what?
but why?
he said l have to
work in his restaurant.
l mean,
he doesn't understand.
when l moved here,
l didn't know english.
l had to learn everything
all over again, you know?
so l used songs
and stuff to learn.
besides filipino,
the only language
l knew was music.
lt helps me remember.
lf that makes sense.
malia, it makes perfect sense.
l don't want to quit it.
then you got to
tell him that.
look, you know what you do?
you tell him your teacher
won't let you quit.
he thinks school is
just a waste of time.
but it's not.
come on, mr. voss.
you said it yourself.
learning this stuff
doesn't matter.
l got to go.
scott: okay, what are
the three branches
of government?
three branches?
all right, three branches.
yeah.
l got this. don't tell me.
oh, hey, you got to eat.

everybody in

(students laughlng)
mr. streb told us that
you were doing this for us.
and l got to say,
you're a hero.
hero?
(slghs)
bella: lt's not sprained.
lt's just a bruise.
good, 'cause l
gotta fight tomorrow.
l'm going to have to
start charging you.
so,
how much money
have you made so far?
three grand.
l'm definitely going to
have to start charging you.
speaking of which. . .
what's this?
$72 from my bake sale.
l had to do something.
this is amazing. thank you.
l got to give it to you.
lt's been a long time
since l felt any kind
of energy in this school.
yeah?
yeah. l don't understand
how we got so far off track.
we?
lt's not our fault.
lt's the system.
(groans) go easy.
oh, so it's the system
that's creating teachers
who just don't care.
oh, come on.
you know the deal.
you can't speed up to
help the gifted kids.
you can't slow down to
help the slower ones.
lt's about moving
cattle through, you know?
lt's a numbers game.
that's what they want,
but what about you?
yeah, look,
there was a time
l couldn't wait for
the school year to start.
l was like a. . . a freshman
decorating my dorm.
you know, l'd put posters
up all over the place
and l'd set up
these plastic models.
no, you didn't.
l did ! l would jump up
on the desk just to
get the kids into it.
lt was so stupid.
no, it's not.
l think l would have
liked you better when
you were that stupid.
all right, well, look,
l need to repay you
for all this right here,
and l think this equals dinner
at my house on friday.
no, l don't think so.
why do you
always turn me down?
do you know there's
a lunch lady who's
got the hots for me?
and l'm just telling you,
l can only hold her off
for so long.
do you even know
that every time
you've asked me out,
you've done it from
a seated position?
you don't even make
an effort to get up.
that's because we're
so comfortable together.
l think, when it's easy,
it's right, you know?
good-bye, scott.
all right.
(groans)
how about
a little jambalaya?
what do you think?
oh, l get nothing?
all right.
okay, push now.
blocking fast, like, lower.
here, over here.
that's good. see?
there. little lower.
just block lower, man.
all right, hey.
all right, come on, man.
this is still defense.
l want to start working
on my offense.
lt's too dangerous.
l won !
you landed a lucky shot.
all right, look.
l know you don't want me
getting hurt. l get that.
but l made twice as much
money my last fight.
l don't think my body
can take 30 more fights.
yeah.
l'm just saying, if l could
actually win a few more,
l could fight less.
yeah. yeah, you're right.
okay. well, then you need
to get good at striking.
fast.
yes.
l know the best guy
for that, but. . .
he probably won't take you.
man: this isn't you
learning anything.
this isn't me
teaching you anything.
this is me seeing if
you're worth my time.
ls it hot in here?
l cranked the heat to 90.
this way,
you get a nice sweat going.

oh, yeah, no.
really brings out
the smell of the place.
oh, yeah. good.
which guy am l fighting?
both.
come on,
l can't fight two guys.
that's perfect.
l can't train a 42-year-old
biology teacher.
your boy is good,
but he's got no offense, man.
you know,
he's a wrestler,
and he picks up fast,
and he's tough.
they're all smiling.
everybody's smiling
and happy.
(groans)
(both laughlng)
(groanlng)
mel, time to eat.
go have some fun.
whoa.
this is going
to be funny.
boom !
three? really?
hey, am l good outside?
l'm parked outside here.
yeah, you got two hours.
yeah? all right.
(gruntlng)
yeah, those are hits.
(pantlng)
come on,
give him a break.
all right, boys,
that's good.
(pantlng)
l'm good, man.
let's go.
come on.
nlko: boom, there we go.
(laughter)
guys.
hey, guys, guys,
listen up.
listen up.
l got something to say.
from genesis 32:24.
"and when he saw,
he prevailed
"not against him."
jacob was tough, man.
he wrestled all night
with god at peniel.
he was tired,
he was beaten.
he had a dislocated hip.
but he refused to submit.
by sunrise, he had
won the lord's respect.
well, tonight, scott. . .
oh, yeah.
. . .you earned our respect.
and then some.
l just want you to
know l got your back.
nlko: whoop, whoop,
whoop! saiud.
(speaklng dutch)
let's eat, boys.
that superman punch, mel,
that was awesome.
yeah, that was crazy.
what's the matter? you don't
like my wife's cooking?
l can't lift my arms.
(laughter)
can you move it?
not much.
l can go, like,
to right about there.
that's it?
yeah, that's it.
right there, yeah.
you're sure?
l can't even
move it past that.
you dislocated
your shoulder.
you have to go
to the hospital.
last time l went
to the hospital,
it actually cost me more
than l made in the fight,
so you got to help me.
but l would have
to reset it.
look, whatever you got to do,
then make it happen.
all right. all right.
okay, you got to go
easy first. no, no, no.
okay.
foot not going there.
all right, all right.
no, you're right.
you're right.
l just got to find
the right angle over here.
(scott groanlng)
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.
come on.
okay, okay,
you're going to
be all right.
you're going to be all right.
you can't go above.
okay, okay,
that's past the level
that l just said
l can't go, though, okay?
geez!
l'm sorry. don't worry.
you're going to
be all right.
okay.
you're going to be okay. okay.
okay.
now, l just got
to get in here.
easy, okay?
l have to get in there.
(groans) that hurts.
all right?
you ready?
yeah.
always wanted to try this.
try this? what do you mean?
you've never done this. . .
(screamlng)
are you okay?
oh, my. . .
are you okay?
lt's back in, l think.
(laughlng) oh !
l did it! l did it!
l was a little worried,
but l did it.
oh, l'm good, l'm good.
that was fun, no?
no.
a little jambalaya
for mama? no?
no, get away. . . get away
from me, you crazy woman.
good night, scott.
(lndlstlnct conversatlons)
voss.
my office. now.
betcher: come on in.
close the door.
sit down.
l'd like you to meet
malia's father,
mr. de la cruz.
how are you?
who the hell do you
think you are, mr. voss?
telling my daughter
to disobey me?
(stammerlng)
l didn't say that.
l said. . . l said that. . .
betcher: and is it true
you're getting paid to fight?
lt's mixed martial arts.
what's this all about?
lt's about our teachers
not promoting
dangerous situations.
look, it's a sport.
lt's no more dangerous
than boxing or auto racing.
and believe me,
l wouldn't be doing it
if you'd been
doing your job.
did you really think
that you could save
the music program
by doing this?
l'm just trying to
make things better.
you know what?
you're not making
things better, scott.
you're putting on a show.
you're getting beat up
in your bathing suit.
you are embarrassing
this school.
you know why l did this
in the first place?
because a wise man
once said,
"without music,
life would be a mistake."
yeah, and do you know
who that wise man is?
marty streb, the teacher
you're trying to get rid of.
scott. . .
there's nothing here anymore.
we're failing your daughter.
we need good teachers.
yeah, well, fighting in a cage
is not going to make you
a good teacher, scott.
you know, maybe you're right.
l'm not even that good
of a fighter.
l'm out there
getting my ass kicked.
believe me,
this wasn't plan a,
but l don't know
what else to do.
look, you're having
a tough time
with your business.
l get it.
but you can't
take it out on malia.
mr. de la cruz,
l'm sorry that you had to
listen to any of this.
no, no, no.
lt's all right. what do you
suggest l do, mr. voss?
my chef left.
that means l'm in
the back cooking.
so l need my daughter
up front.
lt sucks, okay?
nobody's saying it doesn't.
but it's not your
daughter's problem.
lt's yours.
betcher: no.
you're the problem, scott.
this is none of your business.
none of your business.
l've had it with you !
you know what?
we should be working
as hard in here as
you do out there.
and l'm sorry,
but we're not.
and that is the problem.
now, if you'll excuse me,
l have a class to teach.
and then
l got to roll around
with a sweaty guy
from holland.
(lndlstlnct conversatlons)
whoa. what's going on,
mr. voss?
biology, derrick.
fair enough.
can someone tell me
what happens when
a cell stagnates?
(conversatlon contlnues)
okay,
no one is listening to me.
l will try again.
anyone know what happens
to a stagnant cell?
what's he doing
on the table?
l don't know,
something about cells.
malia.
lt's not good.
(conversatlon stops)
did you hear that?
lt ain't good.
people, a cell
that is not in motion
is not a productive member
of the system.
lt ends up assuming
all the other cells
are gonna pick up
the slack somewhere.
but they don't.
ln fact,
they imitate the stray cell
until basically the whole
organism begins to die.
(students chuckle)
yeah.
but you know what?
biology is
an amazing thing.
and here's the good news,
all that decays
can be restored.
ls this hitting anybody?
like how a cut heals.
brian, my man.
look, you got one!
(students murmur)
and once that
cell's back on track,
it creates energy
amongst the other cells.
that's what happens.
lt starts getting
a little movement going.
lt gets a little rumble.
can l get a little rumble
from everybody?
everybody just rumble
in your seats
right now for me.
just rumble a little bit.
okay, no rumble,
that's fine.
(laughter)
l'll be the lone
rumbler up here.
that's what l am.
l'm a lone rumbler.
but then the cell
starts banging
into the other cells.
and the cells
push back and go,
"hey,
what are you doing to me?"
they hit into another one.
"hey, don't do that!"
"hey, that's my friend."
"you don't even know him !"
"you don't know me either!"
(laughter contlnues)
and they're
rumbling everything around.
and once that happens,
it's like a mosh pit!
they're goin' crazy. . .
"l know you,
we work together!"
because then,
they hit a rhythm.
they all hit a rhythm.
and this is the beginning
of the restorative process.
so now,
even if the entire system
is close to dead,
what happens?
martinez, come on.
give me something.
oh, no, not today.
oh, no, not in my house.
no, no, no, no.
(laughter)
look out, here we come.
don't look up
my pant leg, derrick.
you're better than that.
l'm right over you.
come on, man.
what do you say?
lf all the cells
work together,
what will happen?
the entire system
is healed.
exactly.
that is a sick dragon.
(cheerlng)
yeah !
nlko: move it!
come on, scott,
keep working.
hey, you know what?
you look as good going
as you do coming.
and you,
my friend, sat in gum.
please be gum.
okay, so how many years
is a term of the president?
a president serves a term
of two years?
ah, come on.
l can't remember
this stuff.
okay,
what's your favorite song?
my favorite song?
mmm-hmm.
faithfully.
the journey song?
yes.
♪ highway run
♪ lnto the midnight sun
♪ wheels go
round and round... ♪
niko. l know it.
♪ you're on my mind ♪
that's a great song.
they don't make them
like that anymore, right?
(laughs)
well, this is good.
okay, let's try this.
♪ america
♪ has a president
♪ he serves
a four-year term
♪ before he's done ♪
ah, that's beautiful.
thank you.
and it goes
with the lyrics.
l know.
you try it.
yeah, right. (laughs)
okay.
♪ america
♪ has a president
yes.
♪ he serves...
♪ a four-year term
♪ he serves
a four-year term
♪ before he's done ♪
nice! (laughs)
aha!
♪ a four-year term
♪ he serves
a four-year term
♪ unless he is impeached
because then he's gone ♪
(laughs) oh, my friend !
she is unbelievable!
you are unbelievable.
l told you.
more later.
now put him down,
'cause we have
a fight to go to.
let's do this.
(crowd cheerlng)
(holly holy nsfw remlx
playlng)
(crowd cheerlng)
lt wasn't a tap.
lt wasn't a tap.
l was just fooling around.
l was just fooling around.
(crowd cheerlng)
obey my commands
at all times.
the corner of
the ring's broken,
so l'd avoid it.
(crowd cheerlng)
(crowd groans)
the carbon dioxide
molecules
get excited through
a collision with
the nitrogen molecules,
and then there's a whole
bunch of excitement.
derrick?
scott: and 1 5, 1 6,
(crowd cheerlng)
oh, nice head movement, yeah !
cover up, just cover up!
l think you're
wearing him down !
watch out, watch out.
back him up, back him up!
do not lose that grip!
(stralnlng)
you know what to do.
put your weight on him.
don't lose your grip!
don't lose your grip!
don't lose your grip!
he lost the grip.
thank you, mr. voss.

(crowd cheerlng)
don't let him lock
your arm in place!
scotty, pound him !
use your elbow.
got it!
use your elbow!
hey!
l'm giving
the instructions here.
marty: no, l'm just saying
he should use his elbow.
l'm trying to help.
one voice.
no, you shush !
the other gentleman
is using his elbow
and it seems to be working.
can we have this argument
on the car ride home?
(headphones muslc lnaudlble)
yeah !
here's what happens.
okay, you know what?
we should all. . .
marty: use your elbow!
use your elbow!
yes! yes! yes!
(crowd cheerlng)
referee: voss is a winner!
wow.
(students gasp)
all right, everybody,
let's get our story straight.
derrick did it.
"derrick did it"?
(laughter)
hi.
hey.
lnspiring your students,
l see.
yeah, with a touch
of vandalism, yeah.
(laughs)
hey, listen,
in case you haven't noticed,
l'm standing and l just. . .
that offer for dinner is. . .
lt's still out there, so. . .
okay.
so if l was to
let you cook for me,
and l'm not saying l am,
what would you cook?
l'll tell you what.
you name it, l'm cooking it.
really?
yeah.
scott: hey, which one of
these should l go with?
volcano or enigma?
hey, what are you doing?
this is coq au vin.
the sauce is
extremely delicate.
you know what, l'm just
gonna go with both,
let 'em fight it out.
fight, boys!
(chuckles) l haven't
seen you like this in years.
what are you talking about?
l'm jealous.
you're passionate
about something.
someone.
what do you mean?
you got the kids,
you got lauren,
you got your business.
yeah, l know,
but every night l come home,
and at least one kid's
locked in a cabinet.
last night,
lauren says good night to me
by throwing a yogurt at me.
and my business
is killing me.
pepper.
l thought you loved painting.
yeah.
but when dad died,
l just kept going with
the business, you know?
lt wasn't my dream.
okay, we are done.
lt's perfect.
you got to go after
your dreams, eric.
l mean,
if you don't make an effort,
nothing's ever gonna change.
you think?
absolutely.
you got to find your passion
and then let it guide you,
let it envelop. . .
(doorbell rlngs)
she's here.
you're out of here.
already?
oh, yeah.
just two minutes,
stir the sauce!
scott: here you go.
wow, this is beautiful.
you know, you picked
a very delicate dish.
the sauce there
is extremely,
it's delicate.
hope you like it.
well, let's see.
how do you like it?
lt's incredible.
you made this?
yes, l made it.
l told you l made it.
(stammerlng) l made it.
of course l did.
okay.
where does coq
au vin come from?
(clears throat) coq au vin
is of turkish descent.
lt's from. . .
(laughs)
no. lt's french.
no, the name is french.
coq au vin is of, obviously. . .
oui, oui.
but, no, where do you think
they get their poultry?
they get it
all out of turkey.
hence the name, turkey.
lt's all fowl. . .
(laughs)
no, it's all. . .
lt's a bird country.
lt's honestly. . .
okay.
whatever restaurant
you ordered this from,
it's amazing, so make sure
you thank the chef.
and you just did.
the chef, me.
to the chef.
to the chef.
to me.
whoever it is.
lt's me. l did it.
so, l saw one of your
fights on the lnternet.
checking me out.
all right. l see where
you're going with this.
how'd l do?
l don't understand.
when you are asking me out,
you are as
stubborn as a badger.
and then with this guy?
he grabbed your
hand and you're like,
"l give up,
l give up" in two seconds.
okay. first of all,
it's "stubborn as a mule",
it's a mule.
second of all, he had me
in an arm bar, okay?
do you know
what an arm bar is?
lf l didn't tap out,
he's gonna break my arm,
so that's what you do.
that's what you do
when you give up.
you know what?
do me a favor, stand up.
please, stand up.
okay? l'm gonna
put you in an arm bar.
here,
this is a kimura,
right here.
see? feel this?
now what would you do
if l got you here, huh?
what would you. . .
what are you doing?
take it easy.
my father told
me to strike first
and to strike fast
and to always
be the aggressor!
all right, stop it!
what you gonna do now, huh?
you're gonna quit?
you're a quitter!
you're hitting me
with closed fists!
of course l'm hitting you
with a closed fist!
this is a fight!
no, it's not.
lt's, like,
the weirdest date ever.
(slghs) you know what?
you're sort of right.
yeah, yeah, you are right.
'cause l don't know
what l was thinking.
hey!
(bella yelllng)
(both laughlng)
okay. this is definitely
the weirdest date ever.
yeah.
good night, scott.
yep, okay.
(slghs)
well, this was a nice dinner.
sorry about the lamp.
l wouldn't worry about it.
l wouldn't worry
about it at all.
you can just leave that there.
you're good. all right.
by the way, a little
cologne goes a long way.
yeah, no, l know.
l felt it.
my eyes were burning.
l hear you.
boy: give it to me!
(klds clamorlng)
hey.
hey.
can you get away
for an hour?
l got something for you.
l can't, guy.
this is a bad time.
this one thought
the ex-lax was chocolate.
l'm up to my eyes in it.
lauren thinks it's my fault.
lauren: lt is!
erlc: says you !
who keeps ex-lax in
their back pocket?
l had a situation !
you're a situation !
whatever!
where do you want to go?
you got to wash
your face first.
okay, got you.
boy: (ln dlstance)
ow! stop kicking me!
scott: yeah,
and change your clothes.
hey, what's up?
what are you doing here?
we training today?
nah, nah, we're good.
look, l told you
when you joined my team
l had your back, right?
yeah.
l just thought
you should know
joe rogan called.
they want you to
fight in the ufc.
lt's 1 0 grand.
to lose?
yup.
yes! yes!
niko turned it down.
he what?
nlko: relax.
om. . .
let your tailbone be heavy.
om. . .
(laughs) hey!
relax. relax.
back to the peaceful meadow.
(makes chlrplng nolse)
(laughs quletly)
hey, why would
you pass on the ufc?
you're not ready
for a fight like this.
you realize
we're six grand away and
the semester's almost over?
lt's too dangerous.
yeah. but this
could be one and done.
hey, the ufc's the real deal,
all right?
lt's big-time.
there's no broken cages or
chickens running around.
okay, you know what?
l got to be honest here.
l don't see what
the problem is.
oh, yeah, okay.
you know the problem?
the problem is
we're the same age,
and l can kick your ass!
(grunts)
you know, maybe we should. . .
you know what?
he's up, he's okay.
you're a schoolteacher,
scott!
l devoted my whole life
to fighting.
and you should've
been given this shot.
l was good, scott.
when l was fighting, man,
l was beating everybody.
l was unstoppable.
and then when l got
my big break to
fight for the ufc,
l thought to step it up.
and during training,
l just destroyed my neck.
that was it.
over.
l'm so sorry.
l didn't know that.
look, if you don't think
l deserve this fight,
you know what,
l'm not gonna take it.
no, you deserve it.
lt's just me. lt's. . .
l'll set this up.
l'm sorry, bud.
yeah.
lt's just. . .
yoga makes me emotional.
mr. voss, welcome.
come, this way.
l want to thank you
for your help.
business has
never been better.
oh, that's great.
l'm so glad.
your table.
joe. what's up?
what's up, niko?
how are you, brother?
scott, nice to meet you.
l am such a big fan.
oh, thank you.
thanks, man.
joe rogan, wow.
l showed dana white
some of your fights,
and l was there
at the romero fight.
great job when
you put him down.
that is a tough guy.
that's a serious win.
yeah, thanks. thanks so much.
erlc: good evening, gentlemen.
l have created some
delicious lettuce wraps,
prepared with very little oil
and a hint of ginger.
thanks.
actually, best eaten
while hot, so. . .
yeah, we're gonna. . .
erlc: enjoy.
yep, yeah.
(quletly) get out of here.
okay.
thanks.
so, here's the deal.
the ufc had a fighter
fall out last minute
in an undercard fight
against ken dietrich
in las vegas next week.
dana's a little worried
you might throw up on him.
no, no, that was
a one-time deal.
l'm telling you,
it was some bad applesauce
that got away from me.
lt won't happen again.
good to hear.
look, my daughter got
into music in middle school.
lt changed her life.
and l think what
you're doing is awesome,
and the ufc agrees.
we'd like to
give you a shot.
now, niko,
you had some concerns?
he's ready.
joe: okay, good.
l'm gonna grab one of
these lettuce things,
and l'll see
you boys in vegas.
all right, joe, thanks.
good luck, sir.
wow. thank you.
you got yourself a fight!
fight!
marty: okay. l can't believe
that we're doing this.
nlko: ding, ding, ding, ding.
oh, my god,
l love you guys!
l really do.
take it easy, marty.
oh ! listen,
l have a window seat
and l pee a lot.
do you mind if l. . .
okay, we're switching seats.
thank you very much.
l'll be right back, honey.
okay.
hey, scott.
can l talk to you
for a second?
sure.
l just want to tell you
how grateful we are
for everything you've been
doing for my family.
lt's been an honor.
he's my hero.
(man slnglng)
mine, too.
thank you.
all right, you gonna
wish me luck or what?
please be careful.
niko says this guy
you're fighting
is really dangerous.
look, l'm going in there,
l'm gonna lose the fight,
get my 1 0 grand,
and l'm getting out.
(clears throat)
l know you really want
to kiss me right now.
but l think we have
something special here,
and l don't want
to rush the magic.
okay, first of all,
do you know
anything about magic?
'cause magic
has to be rushed,
otherwise you can see
how the trick is done.
so, bring it in.

(pantlng) l'm sorry, buddy.
l don't think l'm going
to be able to do this.
you've already done it.
to hell with my job.
look up there.
look at those kids.
l got to be honest,
it's a little blurry
right now.
then let me tell you
what you would see.
you would see
a bunch of our students
witnessing complete resolve
in the face of
an unbearable obstacle.
they are invested.
scott, they're inspired.
that's what
we're supposed to do
as teachers, right?
lnspire.
