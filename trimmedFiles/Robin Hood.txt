can somebody tell me 
what's going on?
don't be foolish, walter.
get him back to bed.
- bar the door. 
- i'm still the master of this house.
richard, up.
who is there?
wake up, thomas.
open the gates!
bastards.
arrow.
the lantern.
i see you, you little bastards.
i see you!
thieving maggots.
they've taken all our seed grain.
what are we going
to do for planting?
pray.
hello, there!
here you go, lad.
thank you, robin.
robin.
the archers been called to ranks.
bloody typical. i'm starving.
hide these well.
we'll have them for supper instead.
sire.
your bath, sire.
for the love of christ, loxley, 
would you stop them doing that!
they love you, sire.
my head. it's going
like the bells of hell.
is that it?
one more castle to sack,
then we're home to england.
hail king richard!
release!
push!
hey, archer!
stay alive!
i'll see you tonight.
don't forget your money
this time, little man.
it will be my pleasure
to take it off you.
push!
move up!
cover the king! cover the king!
barricades prepare!
let us put these french to bed!
raise the barricades!
jimmy.
calm and careful. make it count.
go!
help!
cover!
now.
go!
move back!
blood for france!
go!
it'll make a fine pin cushion!
king philip's arse!
look what they do
for the lion heart!
push!
push!
that'll burn all night, lads.
don't let them put it out.
these pricks will smash through 
in the morning, take all the credit.
well done, jimmy boy.
john ...
your majesty.
an english princess shut out 
of her husband's bedchamber ...
by a piece of french pastry!
aren't you ashamed?
the shame is surely his.
then go in and tell him.
mewling at his keyhole is neither 
one thing nor the other.
john.
oh, god! what in heaven ...
mademoiselle, you will excuse me.
my son has need of my advice.
no, i don't. ask her.
mother, please,
have you no decency?
i happen to be in a condition that 
no mother should see her son in.
yes, i know, but it's my mother.
that's enough.
on second thoughts,
i think it better that you 
do hear what i have to say.
though i will not have
you in my presence.
mother.
the purpose of my being in this 
room is to save the realm ...
from the consequences
of this unsuitable amusement.
her uncle is the
bloody king of france.
- my uncle is ...
- get down.
her uncle wants her back.
philip wants an excuse to cross ...
the channel with an army.
and you have given 
him that excuse.
take up your lawful wife
and save england.
my lawful wife is as barren
as a brick.
is that truly the wife
you want for me?
hmm?
you, who honored your husband
with eight children ...
so that even now when death has
taken the rest ...
you have a king and the runt of 
the litter to call you "mother."
better the bastard
of a servant girl ...
than bed the niece
of england's jealous enemy.
or bed her and wed her, mother.
i've asked the pope's men
to arrange an annulment.
and do you think the pope ...
will favor england's royal runt 
over the king of france?
he might see his way for the 
son of eleanor of aquitaine.
and for the future
king of england.
richard the lion heart
is 40 years old, if not more.
and no babies.
i am a queen in the making.
yes. yes.
you see?
she is my eleanor.
now, you do understand, 
this game is not about luck.
it's about the science of memory
and a quick hand.
who'd like to take
a bit of fresh meat home?
caught this morning.
we have a pheasant.
three choices.
right, left or middle?
middle.
"the middle," he says.
the middle.
i'm sorry about those onions, 
young man. you lose.
robin! over here, 
they're needed for the pot.
feisty one!
aye, what else we got,
what else we got?
the fire will do its work.
we break through at first light.
with a fair wind,
we can be home in three days.
you return to nottingham?
i have a wife who waits for me.
i have a mother that won't die,
and a brother who wishes me dead.
first thing i'm going to do
is lock them up.
your people will rejoice 
to see you return home.
and that is a condition
i would like to keep them in.
to be remembered as i was.
my army knows better.
lion heart is mangy.
every man in that army
idolizes you, your majesty.
don't mollycoddle me.
i understand how difficult it 
must be to befriend a king.
come on, loxley. let us find 
some ruffians, drink and laugh.
let us see if we can
find an honest man.
yes.
let's do that.
well, that's the thing, little man.
this is not a game of luck.
it's about the science of memory
and a quick hand.
i've got a quick eye.
i'll be watching you.
three choices.
right, left, or middle.
i think i'll take a fourth choice.
- a fourth?
- hmm.
i've been watching you for a 
while now, longstride.
there is no pea.
this game is a trick!
you take out the pea when you're doing 
your slidings and your turnings.
i got you.
don't touch it again.
i'll do it!
you lose.
you're doing better than you think.
get in there, robin.
kneel, you ignorant bastards!
kneel before the king!
all of you, move back, now.
no, no, loxley.
these men are soldiers at play.
sinners after mine own heart.
which one of you
started the fight?
i did, sire.
i threw the first punch.
ah, honest man.
and who're you fighting?
he was fighting me,
your majesty.
i thought him to be
a lesser man.
he was showing me different.
an enemy that shows his respect.
stand up, the pair of you.
not you.
brave and honest.
are you honest enough to tell a king 
something that he does not want to hear?
what is your opinion
on my crusade?
will god be pleased
with my sacrifice?
no, he won't.
why do you say that?
the massacre at acre, sire.
speak up!
when you had us herd 2,500 muslim 
men, women, and children together,
the young woman at my feet, with her 
hands bound, she looked up at me.
there wasn't fear in her eyes.
there wasn't anger.
there was only pity.
for she knew that
when you gave the order ...
and our blades would descend
upon their heads,
that, in that moment,
we would be godless.
all of us.
godless.
honest,
brave ...
and naïve.
there is your englishman.
right there.
well done, robin. you showed him.
the whipping will
be the worst of it.
the branding iron,
that will be the worst.
unless they hang us.
no. no, this will be
the worst of it.
and this will be the end of it.
as soon as i get out
of here, i'm gone.
i don't owe god or any other man 
here one more minute of service.
we go all the way back
to the same breast.
wet nurse.
indeed.
we've been close ever since.
good.
because england,
under your friend john,
is a country with
no fighting spirit.
i can take london
with an army of cooks.
but richard is on his way home.
and under richard, england is 
a different animal altogether.
richard will return home through 
the forest of broceliande.
we know the exact place.
he always travels ahead of his army with 
only a few trusted knights around him.
with richard dead,
it will be easy for you to 
turn the country against john.
there'll never be a better 
moment to invade.
even dying animals
can be obstinate.
kill the lion heart and you 
will be richly rewarded.
heave!
heave!
heave!
for england!
for england!
i need a physician here!
a physician! quickly!
give us cover!
give us cover, now!
cover him!
cover the king.
physician!
why, loxley?
are you not feeling well?
physician!
wine.
what's this?
- the king is dead!
- dead?
dead.
all right, then, jimmy.
knock the pegs out.
we make our own fate
from now on!
i'll come with you.
no, you're not.
we don't take strays.
the more the merrier.
the road will be dangerous.
he might be useful.
where we going?
to the coast and to a boat before 
and the price for a channel 
crossing goes up a hundredfold.
what about our wages?
if you thought it was hard 
getting wages while he was alive,
try getting paid by a dead king.
all right, boys, collect your 
gear as quick as you can.
i like the new church.
lady marion.
i would have been sorry to leave 
without your farewell. thank you.
i'm glad to speed you
on your way, father tancred,
but it was to seek out
our new shepherd.
you have lately been missed at 
sunday worship and my sermons.
i like a quiet church, father,
when i pray for a miracle.
your new flock is women,
children and old folk.
our men have gone to war
or returned broken.
their orphans run wild
in the greenwood.
our fields are ready for planting
but we've no seed corn.
and the church barn
is full of grain.
surely, you do not
expect the church ...
to let its corn be used
to plant your fields?
that grain is bound for york.
i am friar tuck.
father tancred is
elevated to york ...
where i know he will remind the bishop 
that the people of nottingham ...
the bishop does not need reminding 
that the people of nottingham ...
should reap what they sow
and repent of their sins.
the miracle i pray for is that the 
bishop show some christian charity.
as i said, father, i like a 
quiet church when i pray.
you will have trouble from 
the loxleys of peper harow.
you keep bees, tuck?
i keep them and they keep me.
stop!
ambush!
you're a knight?
where is king richard?
oh, god.
where is the king?
- dead.
- dead?
really?
if the king's dead,
where are you going?
deliver the crown.
richard's crown.
how do we assassinate a king
who's already dead?
bring back the crown!
kill the horse!
you are english.
when it suits me.
who are you?
robert loxley.
whoa! whoa! whoa!
that's the king's horse.
jimmy! move!
jimmy!
robin, they're french.
ambush.
go.
john.
no.
he's dead.
help.
my sword.
its value to me is great.
it belonged to my father,
sir walter loxley ...
of nottingham.
do you know it?
aye, i've heard of nottingham.
then the fate ...
the fates have smiled on me.
you must take the sword
to my father.
it will bring me peace.
i took it in anger
and without his consent.
you must understand
the bond of love ...
between a father
and his son.
my father abandoned me to the world 
of men when i was six years old.
i know little of the love
between father and son.
i beg you.
longstride,
say you will.
i will.
it's a pact sworn
in blood, robin.
it's a scratch, allan,
and that's all it is.
robin!
loxley was making for the 
coast to meet the ship.
that crown could be
our passage home.
we're common archers, robin.
if we arrive at the king's ship with 
his crown, we'll be accused of murder.
how do you know ...
that the knights you see walking 
about are actually knights at all?
there is no difference
between a knight ...
and any other man
aside from what he wears.
all we need is about us.
armor, helmets, swords,
and we make england wealthy men ...
with horses and gold.
fate has smiled upon us at last.
and i, for one, shall not turn
my back on her.
take that crown
off your head, will,
and fill it to the brim.
we commit the soul of this boy
to your keeping, lord.
we would ask, when he arrives
at the gates of eternity,
if you could let him in.
goliath's got the soil turning 
nicely. but for what?
nettles?
nettle soup and dandelion salad,
that'll keep us alive.
come, goliath. this way.
until we get a miracle.
this way.
marion, sheriff.
marion, i've been at peper harow,
waiting in vain ...
for sir walter to receive me.
kindly tell him i have better things 
to do than haunt his threshold.
that you have, while robbers 
are roaming free in sherwood.
that's sheriff's business.
why don't you look to it?
tell the old fool that next time,
i'll break his door down.
and if he's too proud to pay ...
no, no, no, no.
he's not too proud.
he's too poor.
in the name of king richard,
you have stripped our wealth ...
to pay for foreign adventures.
whilst at home, the church, in 
the name of the merciful god,
has reaped, without mercy,
the largest share of what we 
had set aside to feed ourselves.
between a sheriff and a bishop,
i wouldn't care to judge ...
who's the greater curse
on honest english folk.
marion,
why, oh, why do you
make an enemy of me
when you have the means
to make me your protector?
what means?
if you leave now,
i will lengthen your life
by not telling my husband ...
of your visit when
he returns home.
your husband? after 10 years?
if he's not dead, he's rutting his way 
through the brothels of the barbary coast.
so speaks a man of experience.
well, think on it, marion.
sir walter is dying
without an heir.
peper harow will fall to the crown, 
and you will be living in the hedgerow.
you'll be glad to come to me then.
captain, there.
sir, we were told to expect 
our beloved king is dead.
long live the king.
and you are, sir?
sir robert loxley of nottingham.
and you?
i'm the king's equerry, sir.
come aboard, gentlemen, before the 
tide floats her. it's coming in fast.

then we'll be riding

jesus, mary and joseph.
peter and paul and mary!
i knew it! i knew it!
good morning, my lord.
some words of advice
on this tragic occasion.
you appreciate everything must
be done correctly,
so you will present
the crown to lady eleanor.
you will go down
on the right knee.
do not look in her eyes when you 
tell her the king is no more.
and do not rise until all 
others rise. do you understand?
yes.
agnes.
my blue and gold brocade.
yes, my lady.
part for the queen.
part for the queen.
cease.
what's this?
what's happening?
king richard returns
from france, my lord.
did loxley deceive us?
kneel.
long life, my son.
rise now.
a king is dead.
long live the king.
long live the king!
long live the king!
rise.
you ...
i don't know you.
robert loxley, sire, of nottingham.
welcome then.
and how did my brother die?
in battle, your majesty,
as was his way.
as was his way.
you deserve a reward ...
let's get the horses.
for bringing home the news.
kneel.
did you say you were
from nottingham?
yes.
your father, sir walter,
owes tax to the crown.
my crown.
tell him it's bloody expensive
running a country ...
and everyone's got 
to pay their way.
we'll start with this.
make way for the king!
make way!
your majesty.
make way for the king!
- make way!
- godfrey.
godfrey, my friend.
it's so good to see you.
- how were your travels?
- good, sire.
what happened to your face?
a hunting accident.
it's nothing.
- frightening.
- your majesty.
call it a dueling scar. the ladies 
will love you all the more.
i bow to your knowledge
of the ladies, sire.
you can get up now.
sir robert.
you will know of me, perhaps.
i'm william marshal.
your father and i were
young men together.
tell him i'm coming
to visit him soon,
on spring's first black night.
i may have need of him.
i will. i'll tell him.
whoever he is and whatever he is,
he knows too much.
get rid of him.
come on, let's follow.
forfeit what you got.
victuals, coin, clothing ...
or your life.
thomas cooper.
is that you?
are you sick, thomas?
we're all sick.
- where are the rest of you?
- don't ... don't tell her.
loop will be angry.
no, it's your mother
who's going to be angry.
now, either you come with me,
or i come with you.
you choose.
well, come on then.
where are they?
answer me.
four men, five horses,
one gray.
have you seen them?
that way.

and so should we be.
where will you go?
i think something is owed
for this good fortune,
and i mean to pay it back.
how so?
the inscription on the sword,
it taunts my memory.
maybe it's just my imagination,
i don't know.
but i intend to take that sword
back to its owner ...
and fulfill the request
of his dying son.
are you mad?
you just said
we were in danger, robin.
now you choose to step back
in to harm's way?
they're bound to go
there and find you.
we can't repay our good luck with 
bad grace. it invites darkness.
- i'm going with you.

- yes.
- no.
tonight is our last in company.
tomorrow,
we go our separate ways.
pack up your share.
we eat and sleep.
will, you're on first watch.
will.
watch your step!
one of them got away.
bastards!
they've stolen my fortune.
richard's army is coming home.
it costs money to keep it together.
marshal, you speak for the money.
i do, sire.
but to disband the army could 
cost more than to keep it.
king richard's campaigns were 
costly. and the expected returns...
what is that to me, marshal?
my brother's troubles are over!
they're over!
clear the room.
so ... taxation.
taxation?
milking a dry udder gets you nothing 
but kicked off the milking stool.
mother, spare me
your farmyard memories.
you have none,
and i don't understand them.
these are difficult times.
we can buy time.
i can send envoys to secure loans.
there are money chests from sicily 
to normandy if you know where to look.
cap-in-hand to moneylenders?
your master's a king.
the crown is owed money at home.
the northern barons plead poverty, but 
that's always been the song of rich men.
so, what's to be done?
give me leave, sire, to go north 
with a company of mounted men.
i'll have the merchants and 
landowners fill your coffers ...
or their coffins.
englishmen killing englishmen.
no man loyal to the crown
has anything to fear.
and loyalty means paying your 
share in the defense of the realm.
that's well said.
hmm? don't you think, marshal?
mother?
richard commanded loyalty not 
by threats but by example.
mother, your sainted
son was an imbecile.
and you supported his every folly 
from here to jerusalem and back.
yes, you worshipped him ...
when the warrior lost territories
hard won by his father.
you kissed his picture ...
while england had to pay
four years' revenue ...
to ransom him
when he was captured.
you are just as much
to blame as anyone ...
for the wreckage
which is my inheritance.
i broke her skin
more than she did mine.
chancellor.
marshal,
you served my brother faithfully
and my father before him.
i think you've spent enough 
time with my family ...
and, no doubt, would like to 
spend more with your own.
therefore, and with regret,
i accept your resignation of all 
your offices and matters of state.
the ring.
your majesty.
choose carefully, godfrey, the spot 
where you would place your dagger.
for i will choose
carefully, as well.
open the gates!
nottingham.
is this your people, robin?
i don't know. might be.
they don't look much,
these middle englanders.
well, they've been keeping your lot 
in place easy enough, haven't they?
i hear that you welsh boys,
you live on leeks.
you co-habit with sheep.
bloody scottish mule.
you wouldn't want to annoy a bee 
hive with your noise, would you?
your swords would be
no good then, gentlemen.
you're the town beekeeper?
bless you, no. i'm the friar.
tuck's the name.
well, friar tuck,
can you tell me where i might 
find sir walter loxley?
if he's not up at peper harow ...
how long will your business take?
stay safe.
god be with you all.
that's it?
after 10 years?
good friar,
where can a man get, well,
moderately insensible
on a drink around here?
allan,
he's a man of the cloth.
i'm sorry, friar.
have you coin?
i have coin.
two pieces.
each.
have you tried the honey liquor
we call mead?
come with me.
gives a man a halo, does mead.
girl.
girl?
either you're going blind or 
you're looking for charity.
are you the keeper of this house?
in a manner of speaking, yes.
i wish to see sir walter loxley.
and you are?
robin longstride.
plain robin longstride?
no sir?
no, ma'am. no sir.
are you here about the tax?
no, i'm here to bring him 
his sword. his son's dead.
this way.
he'll take your horse.
marion!
marion!
maggie, where is she?
ma'am, sir walter calls for you.
i know, margaret.
i can hear him.
tell him we have a guest.
i'm marion loxley.
robert's wife.
my lady, i owe you an apology.
if i'd have known ...
bad news is bad news
no matter how it comes.
indeed, i owe you thanks for taking 
the time to deliver it here yourself.
did you fight alongside
my husband?
yes.
did he die well?
in an ambush, ma'am.
he was the man chosen to bring 
home richard's crown.
marion, who is here?
a traveler, walter.
this news will go
very hard on him.
bring him in.
yes, yes.
tell him robert
is in the holy land,
sends his love
and will return soon.
marion, our traveler
will be thirsty.
travelers are always thirsty.
is that not so?
your name, sir?
longstride. robin longstride.
do you mock me?
sir?
your son,
he asked me to bring you this.
and how does robert defend 
himself if he has no sword?
hmm?
the prodigal son will
not return after all.
so, no tears, no forgiveness
from his father.
no amends to be made.
did you see him die?
i was with him when he passed.
his final words were for the love 
and bond between a father and son.
forgive my rudeness.
my grief has been
waiting for this day.
so come, so that i may see you.
robin longstride.
a common enough
but noble saxon name.
so, you will dine with us.
but first, you must bathe, sir.
you stink.
i've laid out some of
my husband's clothes.
i hope you don't find
that too discomforting.
my lady,
i'll need some help
with the chain mail.
winifred.
the coif has a clasp
at the nape of the neck.
if you take off the coif, you'll find 
lacings in the back of the tabard.
thank you.
i'll have it washed.
marion, more wine.
you've taken a long road
to bring this to me.
i cannot decide whether that 
makes you trustworthy ...
or manipulative.
marion, i'm merely
trying to gauge ...
the quality of the man
we have as our guest.
is he handsome?
- yes.
- mmm-hmm.
in the way that yeomen sometimes 
are when they are sober.
entertain us with a tale
of your life, sir.
we don't get many visitors anymore.
except tax collectors
and other beggars.
i don't know where i'm from.
only know where i've been.
so, marion,
what color are his eyes?
hmm?
i don't yet know.
i have a proposal
for you, young man.
you brought me this sword,
which has great meaning.
if you give me your time,
it is yours.
i could stay for a day, or more.
i have a question to ask you.
and what is your question?
the words on the hilt of 
the sword, what do they mean?
well, i think i have much to tell 
you about history. about your history.
that's very kind.
well, you haven't heard the 
other half of my proposal yet.
i want you to stay in nottingham 
and, for the time being,
become my returned son,
and therefore marion's spouse.
oh, that's enough!
- you've had too much to drink.
- listen. listen. listen.
we both know that without a husband 
you will lose this land when i die.
do you dispute that? hmm?
- no.
- no, so if i say this is my son,
he will be seen as that.
and, so, as your husband. huh?
it is a fair contract.
it is not as if i expect you 
to have children or ...
no, the sword for your time,
longstride.
are you in agreement? hmm?
yes.
marion, go tell the staff ...
that my son has arrived and 
our home is now whole again.
tell them to ring the church 
bells in celebration.
and more wine, please.

what did i tell you?
it seems we are 
to share my chamber.
a ruse to convince the servants.
well, if the aim is deception,
should you not be addressing me 
as "my husband," or, "my dear"?
don't be ridiculous.
well, are you coming or not?
ask me nicely.
please, dear husband,
will you share my chamber?
here.
i sleep with a dagger.
if you so much as move to touch 
me, i will sever your manhood.
you understand?
thanks for the warning.
hello, dogs.
godfrey.
where are your men?
they're dead, my lord.
and loxley?
alive.
then fate has left him to me.
i hear a man's steps.
good morning, my son.
morning, walter.
father.
father.
so what is it that
you know of my history?
patience.
you must show yourself today.
wear your sword.
marion.
i'm here, walter.
reacquaint your husband with 
his village and his people.
i'll see to the horses.
i feel invigorated.
i woke this morning
with a tumescent glow.
eighty-four.
a miracle.
i've always wondered at the 
private conversations of men.
husband.
this is rich country.
where's your cattle
and your sheep?
sold, eaten, stolen, traded.
we've had seven lean years.
our meat now is rabbit ...
or wild pig on a lucky day.
and deer?
if you're willing to risk your 
neck to the king's executioner.
every deer in the land
belongs to his majesty.
these things are god's gifts first 
before the king's possessions.
if it's illegal for a man
to fend for himself ...
how then can he be a man
in his own right?
welcome home, sir.
sir robert.
good morning, joseph. emma.
sir walter is our lord, and you are 
robert returned and you should act so.
sir robert. you remember me?
tom chamberlain. pig farmer.
you don't look a day older, tom.
sir robert.
when will our young lads
come back to us?
will you find my jamie,
tell him to come home?
with no work and little food,
the village boys have gone.
to be soldiers?
poachers.
look at that, mate.
still here then?
for the time being, refer to me 
as sir robert. i'll explain later.
my men-at-arms.
this is about as courtly as they get.
allan a'dayle, will scarlet
and little john.
lady marion.
i trust you had
an historic evening.
for sure.
lady marion loxley. my wife.
well played.
a bit rash but well played
nonetheless.
right you are, robin.
sir robert.
- sir robert.
- sir ...
- sir.
- sir.
- sir bob.
- sir robert.
friar.
ah, marion. good news travels 
from peper harow this morning.
sir robert,
nice to see you again.
you should've made yourself known when 
we met in the field. welcome home.
yes, i should've.
forgive me, friar.
what happens here?
we're moving the church's grain
to york.
politics out of london,
i hear.
this is our grain.
it belongs in this soil.
lady marion, i but follow 
the orders of my superiors ...
and abide by their
saying and rule.
does his holiness know about 
your wealth of honey?
there are wolves in york, 
sir robert. voracious wolves.
the bees are my family.
i'm a procreator by design.
i'm not a churchy friar.
never was.
my bees give life.
they are my life, sir robert.
should not the bishop be told ...
so the clergy can spread nottingham 
honey on nottingham bread?
what if the grain were
not to reach york?
then the bees need
not be spoken of.
i was an old maid
when robert courted me.
i was a daughter of a respectable 
widow with a thimbleful of noble blood.
we were wed,
and then a week later ...
he left to join ship
for france and the holy lands.
and that was my married life
to a man ...
i hardly knew.
- a good knight.
- short, but sweet.
i mean, he was a good knight.
a good knight-at-arms, a soldier.
oh, yes,
my knight-in-arms, even so.
and i in his.
stop! you'll break its neck.
marion.
easy.
i'm all right.
i can't move me legs.
thank you.
my lord?
oh, is it my turn now?
thank you.
nicely done, sir.
and to see lady marion loxley's legs, 
beyond my wildest hopes this morning.
i don't believe
you know my husband,
sir robert.
allow me to introduce
the sheriff of nottingham.
welcome home, sir robert.
you make your mark quickly by rescuing
the king's ram from drowning.
what's this?
what's mine in coin i have the 
right to take in goods or livestock.
if it's god's will.
here's a ram's worth of tax
for the exchequer.
your insolence to lady marion,
i'll consider a debt between us.
mead and grain alcohol?
i thought as much.
there's something
that we need to do.
at your service.
all right, lads.
should've left while you had the 
chance. something's afoot. off we go.
you there! move aside!
we're on church business!
none shall pass ...
unless they can answer the riddle.
moon-mad!
and what is the riddle,
you insolent wretch?
what has 18 legs and
isn't going anywhere?
your next move will be your last.
evening, friend.
i demand to know who you are.
we are men of the hood.
merry now, at your expense.
"the lord taketh ..."
and we shall giveth back.
my advice is to plant it now,
by moonlight.
why is that, good friar?
when it sprouts, i can claim 
it as a miracle from god.
the church in york would
never deny a miracle.
how much further?
about 11 miles.
i thought you had left.
the fields have been planted.
i didn't want to wake you.
how did you find the seed?
if you have to ask,
it's not a gift.
thank you.
pikemen, at the ready!
arms to ready!
prepare!
this king john
is no king of mine!
you! are you baldwin?
open these gates!
in whose name do you
come against us?
in the name of king john.
pay or burn.
we have paid in money and men 
for king richard's wars!
and we have no more to give!
- burn it. 
- archers!
come on.
my lord, this way!
in the name of john,
by the grace of god,
king of england,
let it be known to all who abide 
here that a tax is warranted!
those persons refusing 
to abide by the law ...
will hereby be subject
to severe punishment.
by order
of his majesty, king john.
father tancred!
your majesty.
your majesty.
i have lost the confidence
of king john,
but he may still listen to you.
allow me to know better, william.
you are much wiser than your owl.
i dare say. i've lived longer.
edward, take him.
your majesty.
john is no richard,
alas, your majesty.
but i serve the throne,
and the throne will endure.
speak plainly, marshal.
what's troubling you?
the crown is in peril.
godfrey has been plotting
with philip of france.
french troops have already 
landed on our shores,
and they are murdering englishmen 
in the name of king john.
the northern barons will make 
civil war against the throne.
leaving our coast defenseless
against the invasion ...
which is certainly coming.
so it's left to john's mother to scold 
him like a child and point him to his duty.
my son has an enemy in his court 
closer to him than any friend.
an english traitor.
a paid agent of france.
why are you telling me
when you must tell the king?
isabella!
it is you who must do that.
tell king john that you've had
word from france,
from philip himself, if you like.
why not tell him the truth?
that william marshal ...
ah, a mother he mistrusts bearing 
the word of a man in dishonor?
no.
if you wish to be queen,
you must save john.
and england.
no!
no! no!
godfrey! the bloody judas!
by the bowels of christ,
it's a lie.
you lie!
i'm sorry, my love.
- sheriff.
- up there.
man won't give his name.
demands audience with the sheriff.
demands?
go away.
my lord.
tax collections proceed apace.
nottingham's turn is coming.
good. good.
tell sir godfrey that the sheriff 
of nottingham is his man.
may he put his stamp
on my authority.
i see trouble coming from loxley
of peper harow.
a blind old man gives you trouble?
aye, and his son will give more.
the crusader, robert loxley,
has returned this past week.
marion.
go on! go on.
has he spoken yet?
he was spying, loop.
spying?
robert, i'm ashamed of you.
hello, marion.
i've come to save you.
know him?
boys, this is sir robert loxley,
my husband.
sir robert, the runaways
of sherwood.
untie him.
no, i don't think spies should 
be let off so easily.
that was unkind.
you were a crusader?
yes.
did you hear that, boys?
you bested a crusader.
my men are good fighters.
i don't know about that.
i think the weight of numbers 
might have been in their favor.
but they do move silently like 
the creatures of the forest.
but that's only a skill
if you stay as a man.
you don't become
the creatures you hunt.
we're soldiers.
no, you're not.
soldiers fight for a cause.
what's yours?
you don't have one.
that makes you poachers.
common thieves with a lot to learn.
like what?
i could teach you how to tie knots.
i could teach you which wood 
to get to make your bows stronger.
i could teach you how to make 
arrows that fly more than 20 feet.
and i can help marion to teach 
you how to stay clean ...
so you won't get sick.
i don't know who you're fighting,
son, but it's not me.
i'm not your enemy.
if you want to chat,
you know where to find me.
wife?
marshal.
stand aside!
make way for the king!
your majesty.
what the devil
are you doing here? hmm?
sire?
will you keep that animal still?
what's it got, palsy?
do you think i haven't noticed
how you've deserted me?
if your majesty recalls,
our last conversation ...
at our last conversation,
philip of france wasn't coming 
our way with an invasion fleet.
was he, marshal?
my friend godfrey ...
is not the friend i thought he was.
he's stirred up the northern 
barons against me.
they come south with an army.
marshal, how dare they?
how dare they?
sire, forgotten men
are dangerous men.
the barons need to be told ...
that when the french come,
we are all englishmen.
fitzrobert.
baldwin.
we'll make an army of the 
north and march on london.
the barons need leadership.
wiser kings know they must 
let men look them in the eye,
hear their voice.
together, let us ride
north to meet them.
they march against
their king, marshal.
their king.
we will meet them with the pikes 
of our militia in their gizzards.
you have lost your touch, marshal.
perhaps we'll look to
the barons without you.
saddle up with a spare horse.
i leave immediately.
i want to know
where to find godfrey.
my lord.
i found him, my lord.
where?
nottingham. in plain sight, 
living as walter loxley's son.
then we go to nottingham.
take no prisoners.
leave no stone un-scorched.
take two men, four horses.
ride hard for the coast, then on to 
paris and give a message to the king.
i'll make the place famous.
come, allan!
i'll get them drinking.
you get them dancing!
all right.
music, laughter, the crackle
of a bonfire and a roasting pig.
life has returned.
you have returned it, robin.
how did you know it was me?
who else would sit
by me uninvited ...
like a friend from the old days?
how are you, william?
i'm well and troubled.
ah. and what brings you?
i'm riding on to
barnsdale tonight.
i've heard something of the barons' 
anger against the crown's tax collector ...
the anger has turned into action.
they assemble to march
against the king.
you think you can persuade 
the barons to turn back?
turn back, no.
to join king john
against a french invasion.
- a what?
- help me, walter.
i cannot go with you.
i cannot speak for this king.
he is the only king we have.
but not the only hope.
explain.
marion.
i'm here, walter.
this is my old friend,
william marshal.
lady marion loxley, my son's wife.
lady, i was glad to see sir robert 
when he disembarked in london.
i think you know better, marshal.
sir william, i know, would like 
to meet robin longstride again.
we've met before.
yes, sir, i know. in london.
no, when you were a child.
hobby-horse age.
sir walter and i returned from 
the holy land to fetch you home.
but you'd gone.
we had lost
thomas longstride's son.
it was a wound that never healed.
you need to know what i know.
your father was a stonemason.
is that pleasing to you?
yes. it is.
but he was more than that.
he was a visionary.
what did he see?
that kings have a need
of their subjects ...
no less than their subjects
have need of kings.
a dangerous idea.
your father was a philosopher.
he had a way of speaking ...
that took you by the ears
and by the heart.
none of these things
can be written down, robin.
you must commit them
to your very soul.
this is the science of memory.
"rise and rise again
until lambs become lions."
finally, hundreds listened, 
thousands, who took up his call ...
for the rights of all ranks
from baron to serf.
"rise and rise again ...
until lambs become lions."
what happened to him?
close your eyes.
foundation is set on the rights 
of liberty for all people!
longstride, give up the charter
and their names!
you were there.
you saw it.
i will not.
not dead.
not now.
here is my copy
of the main contract.
this charter of rights
was written by your father.
and here are ... there are the names 
of all the barons that signed the charter.
fitzrobert, baldwin,
marshal and myself.
what he wanted was a charter
for every man ...
wait there.
to have the same rights.
- sir walter?
- huh?
a messenger for you.
bring him in.
step forward, sir.
my lord.
i'm listening.
peterborough's been burned
by the king's men.
fitzrobert gathers an army
to slay king john in london.
marshal requests your presence 
at counsel in barnsdale.
wait outside, will you?
cometh the hour, cometh the man.
the time for pretense is over.
now, hold me like a son.
go.
maggie. where's my lady?
i could not find her, sir.
whether we fight for our lives, 
our family and our honor,
we must fight till the death.
you've spent too long
in the palace, william.
spending time in the palace
gives me perspective.
as we speak,
king philip sails for our coast.
godfrey and his
marauders are french!
every minute that
we waste in disunity ...
brings closer the destruction
of our country!
we have been bled ...
by the king long before godfrey.
go back to london 
and tell the king ...
that we will meet him
on a field of his choice.
make way!
we will not fight
to save john's crown.
rather let him
bend the knee to us.
i'll give you more, sir baldwin.
my breast for your sword point.
use mine.
go on.
no?
oh. this is what you want, 
isn't it? this is what he wants.
fine, i'd rather give it to you 
than have it taken by the french.
you mistake me, sire.
i have no right and no ambition
to wear the crown.
but let the rightful
wearer beware.
from now we will be subject only to 
laws that we have a hand in making.
we are not sheep to be made 
mutton of by your butchers.
godfrey set himself
to turn you against me.
then he did more than was needed
to accomplish that.
a very important decision.
don't you think that we've paid 
too much taxes for far too long...
this is where i was born.
what does it mean?
it means never give up.
we will not be loyal to a crown
that robs and starves us!
the king must listen
to what we have to say!
a king does not bargain for the 
loyalty that every subject owes him.
without loyalty there is no 
kingdom. there is nothing.
i'm here to speak
for sir walter loxley.
- let the man speak.
- let him speak!
- speak!
- speak!
speak, if you must.
if you're trying to
build for the future,
you must set your 
foundation strong.
the laws of this land
enslave people to its king,
a king who demands loyalty
but offers nothing in return.
i have marched from france ...
to palestine and back.
and i know ...
in tyranny lies only failure.
you build a country
like you build a cathedral,
from the ground up.
empower every man ...
and you will gain strength.
hmm.
well, who could object
to such reasonable words?
if your majesty
were to offer justice,
justice in the form of
a charter of liberties,
allowing every man to
forage for his hearth,
to be safe from
conviction without cause ...
or prison without charge,
to work, eat and live on the 
sweat of his own brow ...
and be as merry as he can...
sir, godfrey's men
are on to nottingham.
... then that king would be great.
not only would he receive
the loyalty of his people ...
but their love, as well.
so what would you have? hmm?
castle for every man?
every englishman's
home is his castle.
what we would ask, your majesty,
is liberty.
liberty by law!
your majesty, my lords,
the french fleet
is in the channel.
sire, you have a chance to unify 
your subjects high and low.
it falls on your nod.
i only have to nod?
i can do better than that.
i give my word ...
that such a charter
will be written.
on my mother's life,
i swear it.
godfrey makes for nottingham.
i must stay with the king.
i will send baldwin
and fitzrobert with you.
we will meet again at the white 
horse when you are finished.
robin, your father was a great man.
and you are your father's son.
maggie, who's at the house?
long live the king!
gentlemen.
i'm the sheriff of nottingham.
i'm french on my mother's side.
sir walter! sir walter!
loxley!
show yourself!
loxley!
who calls here?
i call for robert loxley.
my son is not here
to answer you.
that is the truth.
because he's dead
in a french ditch.
and who are you, sir,
to say so?
who am i?
i'm the one who killed him.
fight me if you dare.
lord have mercy.
leave it on the table.
leave it! next!
next! come on!
- name?
- loxley.
christian name?
marion.
land?
lady marion loxley?
i am.
gentlemen, enjoy!
no one should have 4,000 acres.
baldwin! fitzrobert!
take the southern flank
and circle in from the west.
will and allan, get on the 
rooftops and pick your targets.
lady marion.
quickly.
follow me.
somebody, please take the baby!
save the baby, please!
john, down!
it's all right.
go around.
stand back!
make way!
hurry. it's all right. it's all 
right. please, hurry! hurry!
sword!
get down, you bastard french dogs!
where will king philip
land and when?
this is my last arrow.
dungeness! dungeness. two days.
there we have it. we have two days.
once before i said goodbye to
a man going to war.
he never came back.
ask me nicely.
i love you, marion.
longstride!
what news of walter
and nottingham?
sir walter is dead.
godfrey's hand.
gentlemen, we go to war.
it is my first time.
i shall lead.
forward!
that's a lot of french.
what's to be done?
archers to the cliff top.
cavalry to the beach.
we'll await you there.
with me!
archers!
excellent plan.
cavalry!
ready!
raise arrows!
raise arrows!
ready!
raise arrows!
- release!
- release!
release!
for the love of god, marion!
loxley,
circle your troops
and then join the charge.
with me!
release!
release!
forward!
archers, forward!
let's go, marshal.
we're close enough, sire.
this was not close
enough for richard.
and look what happened to him.
forward!
protect the king!
this is for you, walter.
no!
marion!
marion!
surrender!
sire! sire!
they've surrendered, sire!
yes! to whom?
to him.
longstride!
longstride!
i did not make myself king.
god did.
king by divine right.
now you come to me
with this document,
seeking to limit the authority
given to me by god!
sire, you gave your word!
no.
sire, you give us our word, sire!
did i command you to speak, sir?
john ...
or you, madam?
sire, we looked to you!
look to your estates, instead.
archers!
you are fortunate that i am in
a merciful mood.
but as for robin longstride,
that mason's son,
for the crimes of theft and 
incitement to cause unrest,
who pretended to be a knight of the 
realm, a crime punishable by death,
i declare him, from this day 
forth, to be an outlaw!
to be hunted all the days
of his life ...
we will not stand for this!
until his corpse, unburied, 
is carrion ...
for foxes and crows!
hear me! hear me!
by royal decree,
robin longstride, also known as
robin of the hood,
and all who shelter him
or aid him ...
are declared outlaws
of the realm,
their properties forfeit,
and their lives shall be taken 
by any englishman on sight.
a nail please?
and a hammer.
a nail!
off you go. come on.
hey, boys.
you've been practicing 
tying your knots?
have you been shooting
your bow and arrows?
who hit something? anyone?
the greenwood is the 
outlaw's friend.
now, the orphan boys
make us welcome.
no tax, no tithe.
nobody rich, nobody poor. fair 
shares for all at nature's table.
many wrongs to be righted
in the country of king john.
watch over us, walter.
for the lion heart!
