he never even stopped
to grieve properly.
just, give it some time.
how's connor?
president's son, misses his mom.
hell of a gig.

around the white house,
making everybody crazy?
oh, i wonder who taught him that.

minister lee
is going to want you to issue
a joint statement, mr. president...
threatening military action
to get the north koreans...
to stand down from the border
and stop their missile tests.
which i think we should give them.
ruth?
provided that the
north koreans are rational...
which is dicey, at best.
we bluff. they call it. then what?
well, who says we'd be bluffing?
personally,
i like to try to avoid a war.
charlie?
i think i agree with ruth on this one,
mr. president.

so far, the perimeter's been set.
we're waiting on more intel to come
in right now, and once we do...
bravo team's gonna breach.
- wait for my command to execute.
- yes, sir.
not since the british burned down
the white house in the war of 1812...
has an enemy force occupied
the center of american power.
the white house,
the most protected building on earth,
has fallen.
sir,
we have a hot feed from the p.e.o.c.
mr. lee. sir, are you safe?
are you with the president?
sir, can you hear m...?
oh, my god.
don't negotiate.
sir?
i have your commander-in-chief.
now, stand down.

i am the man in control
of your white house.
now, stand your men down.
- stand down!
- sir.
all units, stand down!
ladies and gentlemen we are at defcon 4.
how could you?
- put your hands up.
- fuck you.
no!
there is a reason i never voted for you.
don't do it, forbes!
it takes 15 minutes
for your armed forces
to reach the white house.
we took it down in 13.
hurry, we need a wheelchair.
in triage, do you want me
to color code them or number code them?
color code 'em.
okay, pam,
we still need to take the vitals.
call, mike. mike.
the cellular service in the area
you are calling
has been suspended temporarily.
i got head trauma,
six-year-old girl, she's fading!
bring mr. asher here.
what are you doing, for christ's sake?
oh, sir!
i have no interest
in your nuclear launch codes.
by now your pentagon
has changed then, no?
sit.
you from the north?
you sure as hell are not from the south.
i'm working for justice.
to give millions of starving
men, women and children
a chance at more than just subsistence.
to end the civil war your country
interrupted so long ago.
and yes...
for a united, prosperous korea.
it's a whole new world, baby.
what's the going rate for souls
these days?
what'd you say to me?
i never would have taken you
for a traitor.
me?
what about you?
you sold this country out long
before i ever did.
globalization and fucking wall street.
what's it cost to buy
a presidency nowadays anyway?
$500 million?
i'm a fucking rookie compared to you!
gotta keep your gloves up, forbes.
enough!
what about connor?
what the fuck are you gonna do
with my son?
mr. speaker.
as both the president
and the vice president
of the united states
are unable to discharge
the duties of their offices
i'm officially placing you
under secret service protection.
you are the acting president
of the united states.
are they alive?
they are.
sir, north korea is denying
any involvement in the attack.
we've secured the perimeter
of the white house...
and cleared a 10-block radius.
sir, they've also assassinated
the south korean prime minister.
we have contact
from inside the white house.
trace confirms
it's the president's sat phone.
put it through!
mr. president?
negative.
- identify yourself.
- echelon four.
that's one of yours?
- designator?
- oscar zulu 309.
jesus. banning? where are you?
i'm in the oval office.
is the president in the bunker?
- he...
- can we trust him?
banning was one of our best agents.
mr. speaker, i just have to say,
this is mike banning.
this is the same guy that was removed
from the president's detail...
- after the accident
- whoa, whoa,
- when we lost the first lady?
- ray! ray! ray!
- you wanna add something?
- well, what's he doing
- i suggest you get your facts straight.
- in the white house right now?
- how do we know we can trust this guy?
banning is ex-special forces,
ranger battalion
he will move mountains or die try.
i know him.
does anyone else in this room
have any intelligence
coming out of the white house?
then we have no choice.
yes. the president's in the bunker.
he's being held hostage.
what do they want?
we're trying to find out.
who's in charge?
trumbull.
- are there any survivors with you?
- negative, sir.
they wiped us out.
they have commandos roaming
the hallways...
with enough explosives
to take out an army.
looks like the doors and windows
are rigged with c-4 explosives.
who knows what other tricks
they have up their sleeves?
any team coming in is gonna be ringing
the front doorbell pretty loud.
they shut the power down.
lights off.
and i assume they closed the air vents.
i killed the surveillance,
but i don't know
how long that's gonna last.
where's connor?
oh, we have no status of his location,
but he's presumed to still be inside.
well, they're looking for him.
they have his photo.
sir...
i'm here. use me.
okay, banning. sit tight.
we'll get back with you.
sir, we have a hot feed
from the p.e.o.c.
- mr. speaker.
- what is it you want?
recall the seventh fleet
from the sea of japan.
and withdraw all 28,500 american troops
from the demilitarized zone.
if you do not comply.
if you attempt any operation
to take this building...
- if you deviate from my instructions...
- wait a minute.
we can't just recall the seventh fleet.
then i will execute your officials
one by one...
and their blood will be on your hands.
you have until dawn.
i suggest you move quickly.
who is that guy?
well, sir, we're running facial
recognition on him right now.
well, he cleared as part of
the south korean security detail.
if we recall the fleet,
and leave the dmz...
seoul, all of south korea could fall
within 72 hours, sir.
but if we do nothing, they kill asher,
the vice president...
and his entire national security team.
and connor, if he's in there.
mary, get me some coffee
half-and-half, three sweet 'n lows.
in a real cup.
not one of those paper
or styrofoam things.
all right.
let's secure all nuclear sites.
get me our expert on north korea.
then i want to speak with the premiere
of north korea on a secure line.
after that,
i wanna speak with the russians,
the chinese,
the british and the french.
and set up a press conference.
in that order.
the united states of america
doesn't negotiate with terrorists.
who said anything about negotiating?
admiral hoenig, your cerberus code.
you kill him, you won't get the code.
i will not ask again.
- give it to him, joe.
- mr. president.
you'll never get mine.
tango-juliet-1-9-3-3-4.
louder.
tango-juliet-1-9-3-3-4.
what the hell?
get me homeland security.
no, now!
sir. norad reports a cerberus code
has been entered.
jesus.
jacobs, i got something coming your way.
i got a clean commando in front of me.
- what is that?
- is he alive?
ask me a serious question.
anybody around the table?
we don't recognize it.
well, whoever they are,
they're fucking good.
they're well-trained
and they're well-organized.
but i guess you know that already.
get that over to langley.
so, what have you got? talk to me.
they want us to recall the seventh fleet
and pull our troops out.
oh, is that all?
a cerberus code has been entered.
what's cerberus?
that's classified.
classified? really?
well, right now i think i have
the proverbial need-to-fucking-know.
cerberus is a
highly-classified military protocol.
a 3-pronged fail-safe in the case of
an inadvertent nuclear launch.
it allows us to access
the self-destruct mechanism
in our icbm's in-flight.
so even if one of our nuclear warheads
was launched and we wanted to abort.
cerberus is the only way to stop it
from reaching its target.
no one person has all three codes.
it's parceled out to the president,
secretary of defense...
and the chairman of the joint chiefs.
all of whom are
in the president's bunker right now.
with those codes they can destroy
any long-reach nuke that we fire.
and that would make america vulnerable
to a nuclear strike.
so, change the codes.
we can't.
cerberus was designed
as a self-contained
total-isolation system.
the only way to change the codes
is physically on the computer itself.
which is located
in the president's bunker.
so, now we know why
they wanted the president's son.
the president will hold out
as long as he can.
but if they get his son...
if they hurt him...
well...
nobody could hold out
under those circumstances.
so, find connor
get him the hell out of there.
yes, sir.
mr. forbes.
who is that?
mike banning.
and who might that be?
he was on the president's protection
detail for a few years.
are we worried about him?
hell no.
no.
he should be.
did truman gut the white house interior
in 1948 or '49?
i believe it was '49.
steel frame over
the old stone walls. yes?
connor!
- how're you doing? okay?
- yeah, i'm all right.
i see this is still
your favorite hiding place, huh?
i've got sparkplug
finally, some good news.
he's safe. i'm bringing him out.
what about my dad?
your dad's gonna be fine, okay?
nothing bad's gonna happen.
we can get him outta here.
- okay?
- yeah.
all right. let's get outta here.
- you ready to haul ass?
- yeah.
okay, stay close.
okay.
come on.
okay, come on.
all right, kiddo.
keep an eye out, okay? watch my six.
jacobs.
okay, i have sparkplug.
he's coming out in a ventilation shaft
in the northwest corner, ground floor.
have the green party waiting.
we'll be there.
how are you gonna fit through that?
you're coming with me, right?
i gotta go get your dad.
all right. now, listen, you can do this.
now, you remember chimney climbing
i taught you on the rose garden wall?
yeah? so, that's all it is. okay?
it's one foot against the front wall,
one foot against the back.
now, all the way to the top.
- mike?
- yeah.
i'm scared.
yeah, me too.
but you're gonna get through it.
you're one of us now.
this is yours. put that on.
now, i'm counting on you, kiddo.
okay...
good man. all right. let's go.
there you go, kiddo.
i'm gonna push you on up, okay?
i'll see you on the other side.
now, keep movin'.
sparkplug is on his way up.
oh, jacobs, hold on. connor, wait up.
- false alarm. go.
- okay.
he's coming out, jacobs.
hold your position.
hostiles in the area.
go, go, go! it's clear.
cib-1. going in.
you okay?
coming out.
hostile moving toward the ledge.
hustle up.
sparkplug received.
good job, banning.
now, let's see
if we can get the president out.
roger that.
i want to reassure all americans
and everyone around the world
that despite today's events
our government remains 100% functional.
we know that the president is alive.
to our friends, we are grateful
for your loyalty and support.
as a nation,
we are never stronger than when tested.
we will remain united and strong.
god bless you all
and god bless
these united states of america.
okay, asshole.
yo. hey. who's running the show?
oh, you speak english?
they teach you that where you come from?
'cause you know what they teach me?
is how to extract information
from people like you.
that's funny, huh?
no, it's funny. i know. i get it.
yeah. i guess i'm a little rusty.
i liked your friend though.
he seems like a funny guy.
what's your leader's name?
oh, i'm sorry. here.
how many men do you have?
in english.
his name is yeonsak kang.
he's the head of the kuf.
the paramilitary organization?
no surprises there.
and 28 are left.
how do we know
we can trust the information?
i just asked them nicely.
kang yeonsak?
sir, this is one of the most
wanted terrorists in the world.
he was brought across the dmz as a child
after his father was executed
for crimes against
the north korean state.
while they were crossing the border,
his mother was killed
by an american landmine.
this guy masterminded the 2004 bombing
of the british embassy in seoul.
and he funneled pyongyang uranium
enrichment technology from pakistan.
he's never before been
photographed or identified
by any western intelligence agency.
well, jesus christ,
nobody ever thought to look for him
inside the south korean government.
look, i don't care who he is.
with a force that size
i have men who can sweep
him up in short order.
sir, this is not going to be a cakewalk.
these sons of bitches
are pretty fucking tough.
i've got the toughest fuckin' guys
in the world.
what we need to know is
how to get into that bunker.
once those blast doors close, you don't.
it's nuclear hardened.
now, there used to be some old tunnels,
but they were sealed up years ago.
sir, your men need to know
what the hell they're dropping into.
do not launch anything
until i do some recon.
agent banning. yes, i know who you are.
welcome to my house.
hey, asshole. what took you so long?
you're the one that
let the first lady die, no?
and soon, the president.
failure seems to be a habit with you.
yeah, well...
maybe i owe you for giving me the chance
for making up for that today.
i admire you
for acknowledging your failure.
but there's no going back.
nothing you try and do here
tonight can atone.
yeah, maybe not.
but i reckon fucking your shit up
will be a pretty good start.
you may wanna take a headcount.
the bodies are piling up.
i have more than enough men
to finish the mission.
oh, and by the way,
if you're looking for connor...
he's on his way to the baseball game.
how's your wife, michael?
leah. she's a nurse.
saves lives.
too bad she will not save yours.
you know what?
why don't you and i
play a game of fuck off?
you go first.
go kill him.
enough!
enough!
madam secretary.
your cerberus code.
no!
ruth!
your code!
you'll have to kill me.
as you wish.
there's a saying...
in korea.
seeing something a 100 times...
is not as good as living it once.
fuck you.
stop!
enough!
enough! stop!
enough!
give it to him, ruth.
it doesn't matter.
and he won't get mine.
ruth.
give it to him!
that's an order, ruth.
sir...
give it him, ruth.
yes, sir.
echo-mike...
get your fucking hands off of me!
sir, norad reports that the second
cerberus code has been entered.
my god.
- mike! mike, mike, it's me.

you scared the shit out of me.
jesus, what the fuck?
yeah, just put that thing down.
i almost blew your
fucking brains out, man.
what are you doing here?
i was with the south korean delegation.
what the fuck are you doing here?
i thought you were working
at the treasury.
yeah, i am.
believe it or not,
i came in through the front door.
oh, fuck, mike.
i saw my life flash in front of me.
look at my hand. fucker's shakin'.
jesus christ.
it's good to see you, buddy.
you got a funny way of showing it.

he's alive for now.
they got him in the bunker.
it's a fucking shit show, huh?
yeah, that's for sure.
roma make it?
fuck.
we gotta keep movin'.
- you got a plan, mike?
- yeah.
but it hasn't worked out so far.
fuckin' mike. you always were a hardass.
you never change.
hey, dave.
this place is getting me rattled, man.
i can't think straight.
you okay?
no. not for real.
this fucking kang, man. he's crazy.
how do you know his name?
hey, mike, do you remember that time
in new york?
dave.
why'd you do it?
fuck, mike.
fuck.
i lost my way.
you can make up for it now.
tell kang i'm dead.
you'll help me save the president.
kang. it's forbes.
i got him. all clear.

ruth.
mr. president, sir?
rough day.
could be worse.
how's my hair?
not a strand out of place.
any regrets?
none.
you?
a few.
like running for president.
the office is lucky to have you, sir.
we all may meet our maker today...
but the one thing
i do not want on my tombstone...
"she went down without a fight."
no danger of that.
pull up your satellite feed.
give me eyes on.
looks like there's only four sentries
on the roof.
with the air defense grid gone,
they're vulnerable
to an aerial insertion.
wait. let me get there first
and check it out.
we're not waiting.
we have to secure cerberus.
oh, fuck.
send in the seals, general.
we're going through the roof.

what other surprises
they could have for us.
return to base. return to base. over.
roger that.
banning, are you there? banning!
half the white house is just gone.
the residence, the roof,
all destroyed...
and the remainder of
the historic building now trashed.
speaker trumbull,
that was a very foolish undertaking.
your president is next.
you now have one hour
to recall the seventh fleet
and your troops.
once you do so,
i want a helicopter on the north lawn
fueled and ready.
fuck.
it's banning.
patch him through.
- mike?
- yeah.
we've been trying to reach you, son.
are you okay?
mr. speaker, sir,
if we ever get out of this shit storm...
you can hold me for insubordination.
but your team needs
some serious fucking help.
this is general clegg,
army chief of staff.
i am ordering you to stand down.
remove your only eyes and ears
from the ground.
that's fucking brilliant.
we need to pull you out of there
before we lose another hostage!
i am giving you a direct order.
newsflash, asshole.
i don't work for you.
general clegg.
i'm the commander-in-chief.
if i didn't absolutely need you,
i would relieve you right now.
- i will not let this asshole
- general.
- blow up america, sir!
- i don't wanna here another word...
out of you unless i ask you a question!
sir.
mr. banning.
mr. banning, are you there?
yes, sir. what's the plan?
we're recalling the seventh fleet
pulling our troops back from the dmz
and giving them the helicopter.
sir, you cannot do that.
you cannot give this guy what he wants.
i've dealt with
these types of men before.
give me some time. let me flush him out.
we are talking about the safety
of the president of the united states!
we're talking about a hell of
a lot more than that, sir.
with all due respect,
you're acting president now.
and i'm the best hope you've got.
okay, mike. you've got 30 minutes.
leah, call for you on the landline.
the emergency line.
can you make sure he gets some morphine?
yes.
mike?
hey. i was just checking in.
babe. how's your day been?
yeah, it's been busy.
it's good, you know.
how 'bout you?
yeah. busy.
hey, you okay?
yeah, i just, i've, i've had to stay
a little later than i expected.
yeah, me too.
you're gonna come home tonight, right?
yeah. sure.
we got a date, remember?
hey, i gotta go.
you know, this, uh,
paperwork's piling up.
okay.
i love you.
what's the matter, kang?
you look like you've seen a ghost.
i guess you don't know
who you can trust, huh?
it's over.
no more televised executions.
no chopper.
no more negotiating with you
and the united people's front
of who gives a fuck.
i will send the president out...
one piece at a time.
it won't matter.
because whatever you think
you accomplished
you won't be alive to see it.
shut him down.
ah, you're not shutting me down, kang.
i'm here to stay.
i underestimated you.
it will not happen again.
there is no again.
you're gonna die down there alone
cut off from the rest of the world.
my advice?
save the last bullet for yourself.
'cause if you don't...
i'm gonna stick my knife
through your brain.
but don't worry.
i'm gonna leak the photos
of your body to the press.
you know, 'cause i know you
like that kind of shit.
her!
i pledge allegiance to the flag...
of the united states of america!
your leader is out of his mind.
you fucking idiot!
go.
walk.
move!
sir, there's movement
in front of the white house.
ours or theirs?
looks like secretary mcmillan, sir.
- any bulges, wires?
- negative.
sir, ground reports activity
at the white house.
- is that?
- mcmillan.
get a team out there now.
and another to cover! go!
it looks like secretary mcmillan.
yeah, yes, it is.
yes!
mike?
hey.
he got away. he's back in the bunker.
you gave it a good shot, mike.
you saved mcmillan.
north and south korean military
forces are on high alert
in response to rumors
of an impending american
pull-out from the dmz.
india, china and russia
have declared a state of emergency
and have mobilized military forces.
in the middle east though,
the response to the attack
on the white house is jubilant.
crowds of thousands
are celebrating in the streets
and american flags are burning.
created by a u.s. departure
could spark
an immediate and full-scale conflict
and that any conventional war
in this heavily-armed corner
of the world
could easily escalate
into nuclear confrontation.
the hour's up.
send the helicopter.
le's recall the seventh fleet.
pull the troops out of the dmz.
we just lost south korea.
our pentagon sources are now saying
that u.s. ground troops
have been given the order
to withdraw from korea
for the first time in 60 years.
we're also hearing reports
that the u.s.'s seventh fleet
has been directed to pull back
in the region.
although unconfirmed,
this historic turn of events
seems to be motivated
by today's attack on the white house
which began
as the prime minister of korea
was meeting with president asher.
what are they doing?
mike. we have to get kang
and the president out
in the open and take out our best shot.
copy that, sir.
bravo team is in position.
sir, we are ready.
all units are in position.
here come the hostages.
we count 11 targets, sir.
one of them's gotta be the president.
that's their ticket out.
hercules six in position.
can you i.d. the president?
negative.
can you i.d. kang?
negative.
targets unclear.
sir, all ground units are in position.
do we have the go-ahead to take them?
if we're gonna go, we gotta go now, sir.
do we have the go-ahead, sir?
no. too risky.
they could kill the president.
yes, sir.
it's okay.
we have a tracking device on the chopper.
holy shit. what was that? was that us?
negative, negative. that wasn't us.
though it is not confirmed yet,
president asher
is believed to have been
among those killed
when the blackhawk helicopter went down
in flames on the white house north lawn.
and certainly, today's events
will be recorded in history
- as one of this country's darkest hours.
- oh, my god.
the president's gone.
mike?
what the hell just happened?
i'm sorry to report...
the president was on that helicopter.
and kang?
kang killed himself.
and all the other hostages.
wait. this doesn't add up.
it doesn't make sense.
what doesn't make sense?
kang would not go out like that, sir.
that's not who he is.
i think he's still in the bunker.
and he has the president.
he's gonna try and slip away.
if kang is still on the premises
with the president,
you can't let him leave.
he won't.
huh? who the hell does that?
enough!
i read your bible, mr. president.
it says, the wages of sin is death.
you better keep that in mind.
what are you doing?
cerberus has been activated.
we haven't launched any missiles yet.
i don't need to launch them.
the explosive force
within each hardened silo
will detonate the missiles.
tens of millions of americans
will perish.
your country will be a
cold, dark nuclear wasteland.
now, too, america shall know
suffering and famine.
south korean officials are saying
now that they've pulled out the reserves
and they're mobilizing additional
armored units in response...
sir? cerberus has been activated.
- what?
- norad confirms.
how did it come to this?
we lost korea and now our nukes?
- they couldn't have broken the code.
- that would be impossible.
they'd be on the bunker computer
for days to break three codes.
no, he only need to break one code.
but we haven't launched any missiles.
they're gonna detonate them
in their silos.
how many?
all of 'em.
he's just opened the gates of hell.
time to go, mr. president!
you really think you're gonna
get out of here alive?
the world thinks we're both dead.
and with you as insurance...
come on, mike.
looks like you failed again, mike.
sir?
sir, sir, look at me. sir...
sir.
okay. it's gone through
and you've lost a little blood.
but i'm gonna get you outta here, okay?
now, you know what to do.
ben, ben, come on!
- cerberus.
- what?
cerberus activated.
cerberus.
keep that pressed in.
sir! ben!
you're gonna be okay.
all right.
this is banning.
i have the president.
he's hurt, but alive.
how do i switch this fucking thing off?
- hang on.
- deactivation code!
find a control panel marked,
"countermand."
countermand.
got it!
flip a blue-white switch marked,
"initiate recall."
initiate recall.
okay.
deactivation sequence initiated.
please enter abort command.
come on, come on, come on, come on!
november. india.

- wait, wait. yep.

- foxtrot.
is that it?
that's it.
cerberus has been deactivated.
sir. norad confirms...
cerberus has been shut down.
good.
now get me seoul and pyongyang
on the line.
are you ready, mr. president?
all right.
sorry about the house, sir.
it's okay. i believe it's insured.
we've lost good friends.
family.
all good people.
- heroes, every one of them.
- dad!
our hearts and prayers
go out to their families.
and they will be remembered.
nor will we forget...
those who serve out of the spotlight
to whom we owe our highest gratitude.
our foe did not come only to destroy
our things or our people.
they came to desecrate a way of life.
to foul our beliefs,
trample our freedom.
and in this, not only did they fail...
they granted us the greatest gift.
a chance at our rebirth.
we will rise. renewed.
stronger and united.
this is our time...
our chance to get back
to the best of who we are.
to lead by example with the dignity,
integrity and honor
that built this country
and which will build it once again.
may god bless you.
and may god bless
the united states of america.
