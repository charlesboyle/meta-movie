[whistles then speaks in spanish]
maria:

every christmas we use a tree
that dad grew.

mr. perez: twelve-fact fraser fir.
lock at the branch distribution.
oh, i see.
hey, hey!
she's very delicate.
i've been growing her for eight years.
eight years, wow. i never knew
christmas trees were such a big deal.
oh, god.
not a big deal?
let me tell you a story, harold.
growing up in medellin...
...my family was too poor
to celebrate christmas properly.
every year i would pray to god:
"please, let me wake up and find a big,
beautiful christmas tree."
and every christmas...
...i was heartbroken.
when my mother finally
moved me to america...
...she promised me we would have...
...a christmas tree every christmas
from then on.
but one week before that first christmas,
while walking home from work...
...she was violently attacked...
...by a gang cf korean punks.
[grunts]
they stabbed her multiple times.
she bled to death.
so i guess...
...you could say, yes,
a christmas tree is a big deal.
oh, my god.
-[whispers] why didn't you tell me?
-[mouths] pm sorry.
pepe! where are the ornaments?
i don't know.
my eyes are all fucked up.
you can't celebrate christmas
with a naked tree! it's indecent!
maria, forget about midnight mass.
tonight, we're decorating the tree.
oh, daddy, i wanted
to spend tonight in the city...
...with you guys.

[maria chuckles]
adrian: oh, b-t-dub, the girl tonight?

...the life cut cf you...
...this afternoon?

...name in vain. secondly...
...i was baptized, bitch!
the second the priest...

...all my jewish neurosis and self-hatred
just washed right off.
kumar: sounds like you're enjoying
your new religion.

these dirty jew bastards have...
...no idea what they're missing.
fishing! hunting!
i tie knots on a sailboat.

the last chance we've got.
here's what we do.
first, we need to steal some tickets.
then i slip off to the side
and take out the archbishop.
i head down
to the nuns' shower room.
harold: i didn't know the nuns
all showered in the same room.
how do you think they stay so clean?
while the nuns are lezzing it out,
i'm gonna snag the key to the back room.
harold:
what back room?
the back room that the priests
are guarding. am i going too fast?
- no.
- okay, good.
you're in charge cf distracting them.
how the hell do i do that?
kumar: that's easy, you'll just use
our secret weapon.
pillow fight in the altar boys' room.
last one there's a rotten egg.
kumar: once the coast is clear, we use
the key to get into the back room.
i guard while you kill the power.
while everyone's trying
to turn the power on...
...you and i will get the tree.
we take it to your place,
and when maria's dad comes home...
...and sees this beautiful tree...
...in your living room,
he'll jizz all over it.

i'm supposed to be at home with the tree.
but why are you making
such a big deal about this?
because it is a big deal.
who gives a shit what
your father-in-law thinks?
i give a shit what my father-in-law thinks.
you wouldn't understand.
no, dude, i don't understand.
you got a great job, you make good money,
you don't beat your wife.
what more could a latino
father-in-law ask for?
- well ...
- if i were you...
...i'd tell him to eat
a cockmeat sandwich.
you should not go through...
...all this just to make him happy.
you're right, i don't have to.
i want to.
i want him to be happy
because i want maria to be happy.

kumar: mission accomplished.
- all right, put down the tree. put it dawn.
- unh!
harold: all right.
- waffle break?
all right. oh, god.
oh, my god. wafflebot.
dude, seriously...
...these are incredible waffles.
kumar and wafflebot friends forever.
ha, ha. no doubt, wafflebot.
i love you...
...kumar.
- ha, ha.
i love you too, little guy.
harold:
what the fuck?
that is the weirdest fucking toy.
you're happy.
see? you're laughing.
you're having fun. admit it:
i'm more fun to hang cut with than todd.
todd and ava.
i totally forgot about them.
i'm sure they're fine, right?
it's going to voicemail.
i think they're fine.
todd's a big boy.
he's probably putting her
to bed or something.
yeah. they're probably fine, right?
madea [on tv]:
look at me, look at me!
why wasn't you at school today?
i went to the park.
she lying.
madea: what was you doing?
you supposed to be at school.
[bag rustling]
little girl, i'm not gonna
ask you no more.
nikki: i'm not smart like the other kids.
i can't do that stuff.
madea:
who told you that?
nikki:
my last foster mother.
she told me that the only thing i'm gonna
be smart enough to do is lay on my back.
madea: the best revenge you can have
on somebody that told you that...
[crunching]
...is to prove them wrong. l went to
that school and i got your homework.
todd [whispers]:
are you fucking kidding me?
["deck the halls"
plays as ringtone]
- oh.
- oh.
maybe that's todd.
whoa, why is vanessa calling you?
oh, that's because maria is--
- hello?
vanessa: kumar?
- is that you?
- yeah.
why are you calling harold?
[sighs]
can i just speak to him, please?
what? no.
i've been texting you.
i haven 't heard back.
what's going on?
tell him i'm not gonna...
...make it to his party tomorrow.
oh. oh, you're not gonna make it--
she won't make it to your party.
too bad.
what else have you been
doing behind my back?
has she seen your dick?
is it bigger than mine?
kumar, you're acting ridiculous, okay?
goodbye.
no, don't hang up the phone on me.
hello?
here's your phone.
what is that?
that's vanessa, todd,
rosenberg, uncle yoav.
does everybody know
about this party?
listen, if you want you can come.
i don't wanna came to your
shitty-ass party, dude.
i can't believe you'd invite
vanessa and not tell me.
am i supposed to feel bad?
maybe if you acted more like an adult,
you'd get invited to adult parties.
maybe you should go back
to your fancy house...
...with your douchey friends
and gay-ass sconces.
i don't need to be part cf this.
i love those sconces.
you know, i was really happy
till you showed up today.
okay. well, then, fuck it, dude.
- i'm cut.
- fine with me.
fine.
- cool.
- all right.
- are we having lovers' quarrel?
-oh, shim.
[muffled grunting]
kumar, my friend.
oh, lock.

gustav:
mary would...
...love one cf these.
- uh-huh.
gustav:
grab it.
oh, crap.
gustav:
wake up!
wake up! wake up!
wake up.
- wake up.
- oh.
oh, sun.
please, i don't know what we've done,
but please let us go.
after you made eiffel tower on mary?
that was a misunderstanding.
i'm freezing!
give us back cur clothes.
yuri, warm them up.
wafflebot:
kumar.
kumar:
please don't do that.
please, please, please.
there is a very serious gas crisis...
...in the world. let's discuss.
- came on, man!
as they say in my country:
[speaks in russian]
no, don't say "do svidaniya."
come on.
you didn't get the lighter.
you said gasoline, orbits and coffee.
nothing about lighter.
gustav:
you stupid...
...fucking moron!
you're such a fuck-up!
oh, sun.
[speaking in russian]
[gustav speaking in russian]
hey, guys, stop!
stop! guys, guys, stop it, stop it.
now, look, i understand that you guys
have your issues, okay?
but wasn't there a time you actually
used to get along? you might be in...
...a different time and place,
but that doesn't change the fact that you...
...have along and probably
beautiful history together.
yeah, maybe one cf you fucks up
every new and again.
happens.
maybe he fucks up all the time.
doesn't mean the other should
forget about the good times.
right.
right.
yeah, and maybe just
because the other one...
...is trying to act like an adult...
...and be responsible
doesn't necessarily mean...
...that he's being a fucking chode.
maybe he's been a chode,
caring more about bay windows...
...and sconces
than a lifetime cf friendship.
what do you say, guys?
[sobbing]
- yeah, hug it cut.
- all right.
hey, guys.
how about you cut us cut?
we'll go get ourselves
a christmas beer.
- a beer sounds great.
harold: awesome.
[chuckles]
gustav:
but first...
...we have some killing to do.
come on!
after we just had that breakthrough?
sorry. say your goodbyes.
it'll all be over quick.
- is this haw we die?
- i think so, dude.
bye, kumar.
bye, harold.
wafflebot:
kumar.

...are ready.
- wafflebot?
these guys think pancakes
are better than waffles.
i hate...
...pancakes.
[gun clicking]
they serve pancakes...
...in hell.
[scream s]

...unsafe, but it did save our lives.

- oh, my god.
holy shit!
this is like that...
...scene from a christmas story.

oh, god, i ruined your dick!

...killing machine leaves.

[in russian]
i don't know russian,

adrian:
