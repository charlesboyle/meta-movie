<i>hey, i've been doing some homework</i>
<i>on this kid tobey marshall
from mount kisco.</i>
<i>this kid was a phenom.
used to tear up the local circuits.</i>
<i>him and his dad, man,
they campaigned like champions.</i>
<i>of course, mount kisco
had another great, dino brewster.</i>
<i>you all know dino.</i>
<i>he went on to race
in the big leagues at indy</i>
<i>and tobey just kind of
fell through the cracks.</i>
<i>well, here's some news' cretins.</i>
<i>tobeys been running again,
and running fast,.</i>
<i>real fast, fast as
that "grim taquito" will take him.</i>
<i>tobey, you wanna ﬂy with the eagles,</i>
<i>you need bigger wings, son.</i>
<i>i'm just telling you right now</i>
<i>that if tobey marshall
ever got a car worthy of his talents,</i>
<i>he could be toeing the line at de leon.</i>
give me four clicks of compression.
all right.
actually, make it three.
no, two. two is perfect.
you wanna make up your mind?
what is it, two, three, or four'?
- exactly.
- yo, guys!
you know i'm gonna hurt you, right?
- two.
- thank you.
guys. joe, you gotta
check this out, man.
- yo.
- monarch's on fire.
<i>cretin, go ahead.</i>
<i>monarch, this is darryl
from east orange.</i>
<i>why would you let</i> a <i>redneck
trust fund baby into the de leon?</i>
<i>he doesn't deserve to</i> be
<i>in a winner-takes-all</i> race
<i>with multi-million-dollar cars!</i>
- come on, monarch!
- caller?
do i get to talk?
darryl, have your parents
ever smacked you upside the head?
see, this is a case where sometimes
you just need to beat kids.
darryl, darryl, it's my show. i get...
shut up! listen to me!
darryl, one important question.
have you ever even driven a race car?
that's what i thought.
let me explain to all
of you people out there
how this works one more time.
it's my race.
it's the de leon. i created it.
it's rarefied air, kids. it's beautiful.
i decide who gets in,
and who does not
get in to the race, okay?
i loved your dad.
he was a customer of
the bank for 30 years.
thirty.
what y'all talking about?
<i>the flyin' hawaiian just took down
steve heavy chevy</i>
<i>-in the arizona desert.
- what?</i>
<i>man invitation as</i> a <i>wild card.
okay? that's important.</i>
<i>wild card. maybe.</i>
<i>i'm not saying he's in,
i'm saying he might be.</i>
who was that?
he's just an old customer of my dads.
i didn't recognize him.
yeah, he might bring
his car in on friday.
what's wrong with it?
our job to find out.
i was thinking about the race tonight.
we should get there early.
five cars, the race is full.
pot should be, like, what?
five grand.
- tobey.
- pete.
- you good?
- good.
- are you ready?
- yeah.
you know,
monarch gave you a shout-out.
- then he shit on your car.
- yeah, i know. i heard.
never mind that.
while monarch was talking about you,
i had a vision.
all right, here we go.
quiet, okay?
i happen to like his visions.
pete, proceed, please.
i see water, and the sun, and...
- your sister in a bikini.
- shut it.
i see tobey looking at a lighthouse.
i see you,
and you're gonna win de leon.
- really?
- hey.
thanks for the vote
of confidence, petey,
but i got my hands full
trying to beat jimmy macintosh
and you tonight, so...
oh, man.
my sister and dino are here.
she didn't tell me
she was coming home, tobe.
i'm sorry.
no, it's fine.
coming with dino isn't.
what's this fool
even doing back here, man?
maybe he just came to watch
how a real racer drives.
the guy raced indy.
it doesn't get more real than that, finn.
let's go, tobey.
you don't need that distraction.
no, it's fine.
all right, boys,
the race is gonna start soon.
ben, you should head up.
i just wanna let
you know i'm going because i want to
and not because you told me to.
- j ust know that.
- okay.
way to put your foot down, benny.
nice pleather jacket, homie.
- hey.
- hi, guys. hi, petey.
how are you?
-i'm good. how are you?
- good.
- are you racing tonight?
- yeah.
- you be careful.
- okay.
<i>okay.</i>
hi, tobey.
anita.
i'm really sorry to hear about your dad.
did you get my flowers?
yeah.
good.
and thank you for watching out for pete.
he's like a little brother to me.
how's the shop?
the shop is... it's good.
it's good.
yeah?
how's the city?
it's different than i expected,
but it's not here.
are you still allergic to mount kisco?
actually, dino has something
he wants to talk to you about.
i doubt that.
after the race, though.
i don't wanna distract you.
then you should have
stayed in manhattan.
you look beautiful.
- how are you feeling?
- good.
<i>have you got the roads looked dawn?</i>
the road is clear.
we are at the finish line
and benny is in the cessna.
<i>liar one, you standing by?</i>
<i>here we go with this again.</i>
i wouldn't have to use that handle
if you stopped telling people you
flew apache helicopters.
i took an apache for a joyride, okay?
that's all i said.
i know that's what you said.
we just don't believe you.
hey, man, look,
just because i'm a crew chief
doesn't mean i don't know how to fly.
you gotta have balls
of titanium alloy to do what i do.
<i>so i need a little respect.
a little r-e-s-p-e-c-t.</i>
all right, enough messing around.
what's the status,
liar one?
<i>clear, and this is "maverick."</i>
call me maverick,
or i will kamikaze this
into your nut sack.
mind if i watch?
<i>okay, gentlemen, please be advised,</i>
<i>i got traffic ahead.</i>
repeat' i got traffic ahead.
that was close. he got lucky.
it's not luck. he's patient.
sorry, little buddy.
my house!
benny!
you bodied that guy's grocery cart.
what's wrong with you?
yeah!
yeah!
sweet!
<i>hey, yo, father joseph,
make sure you save me a beer, buddy.</i>
<i>hello?</i>
that's what we do. that's right.
benny, my man.
i thought you had him, brother.
nah, i had him in the turns.
where were you? we missed you,
brother, we missed you.
what do you mean?
i was ﬂying, watching your butts.
- you were flying?
- flying?
- i didn't see him flying.
- y'all gonna play me like that?
- i didn't see him flying.
- did you see him flying?
maybe you should ask
the shopping cart guy
if he saw you ﬂying up there.
shots fired! boom, boom!
so i'm supposed to watch out for cops,
fly the plane,
make sure you got a clear lane
and look out for homeless people
coming out of the shadows?
i didn't get that memo, i'm sorry.
nice driving.
i'm impressed.
<i>tobey marshall.</i>
the man to beat in mount kisco.
sorry about your old man.
i know you were close.
you lost, dino?
what?
i mean, i haven't seen you
around for a long time.
i figured, you know, you must be lost.
so, nothing has changed.
after 10 years, you wanna
just pick up some locker room fight.
what do you want?
i wanna see you build a real car.
i got plenty of cars to build, dino.
yeah.
how's that going for you?
i didn't come to insult you.
i came to make a business proposition.
it could be a game-changer for you.
are you handing out
dreams now, dino'?
i've seen a hundred custom racing
shops since i left this town.
i still haven't seen
work <i>as</i> good as yours.
that's these guys. not me.
i have a very special car
that needs to be finished.
what kind of car are we talking about?
ford mustang.
a mustang?
it's the one ford
and carroll shelby were building
when carroll died.
how did you get it?
mr. shelby and my uncle,
they were close.
you finish building my mustang
like you rebuilt that gran torino,
i'll give you a quarter
of what we get for the car.
a quarter'?
the car is worth 2 million.
minimum.
that's $500,000 in your pocket.
forget about the past, tobey.
it's history.
i'm hereto make peace.
and money.
don't answer me now.
just think about it.
i don't need to think about it.
i'll do it.
i'll get the car here tomorrow.
okay, i just wanna be the first
to take the ﬂoor here and ask you...
have you lost your mind?
you're gonna have us
work for dino brewster?
word?
what are you thinking, tobey?
you don't wanna have anything
to do with that piece of shit.
and, look, if this is about anita,
trying to get her back or something...
do it another way, homie.
write a poem or some shit. okay?
i'll help you out.
"dear anita,
nothing is sweeter than anita
"i really aneeda... anita"
and ijust came up with thatjust now.
just now!
yo, forget about
that fool and his turtleneck.
all right? just tell him you're out.
we're doing fine without him.
we're not.
okay. we're not doing fine.
look...
i'm behind on the loan.
that guy from earlier...
that guy is from the bank.
and he's just gonna keep coming back.
tobey, if you say we need him,
then i'm with you.
wait. we made five grand tonight.
it's gotta be enough
to make the payment.
what about next month?
we'll figure it out.
we always do.
this time it's different, okay?
if you guys don't show up tomorrow
to work on that car,
we're gonna lose this place.
hey, come on, guys.
this is carroll shelby.
this is an opportunity of a lifetime.
we're doing this. all right? for tobey.
you're cheating, man. quit cheating!
you just can't keep up.
shit!
here we go.
yeah.
all right, all right, all right.
where is the rest of it?
we got a lot of work to do.
yeah.
do you like that car over there?
- yeah, it's nice.
- yeah.
we built that.
so, you're a mechanic.
that was real smooth, bro.
hey. do you like that car over there?
okay. excuse me.
we built that.
we're mechanics.
we're not afraid to get our hands dirty.
do you know what i mean?
do you like that car over there?
how fast does it go?
<i>fast.</i>
very fast. pete.
aren't all mustangs fast?
well, this one was built by ford
and reimagined by carroll shelby,
the greatest performance car
builder in american history.
she's not from around here, petey,
so she probably
has no idea who carroll shelby is.
but why is it so fast?
it's 900 horsepower, baby.
is that a lot?
- are you kidding me?
- petey.
look, miss, this isn't the kind of car
you can just go to the mall and buy.
trust me when i say, it's one of a kind.
can i see the engine?
sure.
svt supercharger and racing headers.
yeah, it's quite nice, actually.
i wasn't expecting that.
nor was i.
why?
because i'm a woman?
or because i'm from england?
mr. shelby's first cobra was built
using an ac body made in england.
it had a ford 260 cid v8 engine.
of course, you already knew that.
life can be full of surprises.
i find life to be full of
people who think they're smart
because they have a fancy accent.
no offense.
some taken.
i really love piers morgan.
so, this is how it goes, is it?
you're very quiet, very tough,
and then you're just constantly
cracking these hilarious jokes.
hey, jules.
three million is way too much
for this car, dino.
well, that's what it costs.
- let's see what ingram thinks.
- i am what ingram thinks,
and he thinks two at the most.
well, three is the number.
three is absurd.
that's why nobody has bid on it.
that's the best car
i've driven since indy.
you haven't driven it, dino.
tobey's had the keys the whole time.
do you want me to turn around
and plug my ears
while you all gel on the same page?
what's the top speed?
-180.
-230.
he's talking about
a theoretical top speed.
i know that you don't really talk,
but maybe mr. strong and silent
could be a little less silent.
she'll go 230.
top nascar speed ever was 228.
this car is faster.
you get anything close
to 230 out of this car,
ingram is going to buy it on the spot.
for 3 million.
give or take a million.
mostly take.
good night, lads.
bye.
are you crazy?
what if i can't get the car there?
well, maybe you can't,
but i can.
i'll drive.
don't even think about driving that car.
yeah, tobey!
what are you guys doing?
stop! stop!
what the hell are you doing?
you don't own this car!
you don't get to joyride it!
top speed just over 230.
according to this.
he'!-
that was some driving, son.
and that is one hell of a car.
it's going to cost me $3 million?
that's the price.
what the hell were you thinking?
we sold the car, dino.
you never could've got that car to 230.
even on our track.
you think you're
a better driver than me?
everyone knows he's a better driver.
you know, i'm just about
done with you, pete.
hey! back off, dino.
i'll beat you on a track, the dirt,
a road, anywhere else you wanna race.
hey, you're the man, okay?
you're the pro.
you got nothing to prove to me.
let's move on.
no.
no, let's race.
if you win, i'll give you
my 75% of the mustang deal.
if you lose,
you give me your 25%.
well, that makes it interesting.
this is the biggest house
i've ever seen.
it's my uncle's place.
don't worry, he's in monaco.
these aren't even legal
in the united states.
they're all euro-spec cars,
so technically,
they don't even exist here.
are they some kind of ferrari?
koenigsegg agera r.
top speed, 270 miles an hour.
but, dino, i thought
you didn't go faster than 180.
you got a big mouth for a fan.
yeah, well, then let me race.
i'll be happy to have you, pete.
- awesome. i'm in.
- whoa, whoa, whoa.
hey. sit this one out.
no. lei him be a big boy.
three identical ageras.
after you.
the finish line is at the end
of the bridge, over the 684.
the first car to get
to the other side wins.
<i>tow!-.</i>
this is my vision.
this is how i saw you winning de leon.
you beat dino, take his car and win.
wow.
whoa!
thanks, little buddy!
you got it' man!
yeah, pete.
come on!
we got him, pete.
no!
no, no, no, no, no.
pete!
no!
no!
"fear not, for i am with you.
"be not dismayed, for i am your god.
"behold, all those who
were incensed against you
"shall be ashamed and disgraced.
"they shall be nothing.
"those who war against you
shall be as nothing.
"for i shall hold your right hand,
saying to you,
"'fear not, i will help you."'
let's go through this again,
mr. marshall.
a couple witnesses say
they may have seen three cars,
but we can't find the third car.
why don't you use
that diagram there to show us
where you claim
the third car to have been.
my car was about
two car lengths ahead.
this is where pete was,
and dino was right behind him.
he tapped his back bumper hard,
and at an angle.
dino has two witnesses who say they
were with him the whole day.
and the owner of brewster motors
reported two koenigseggs
stolen last week.
just seven minutes before police
arrived at the scene of the crash.
that's his uncle, okay?
they're lying.
all right? he was there.
dino was there.
mr. marshall,
you're the only one
that can place dino at the scene.
no way is this happening.
this isn't happening.
pete... this isn't happening.
<i>- bill ingram speaking.</i>
- sign <i>here.</i>
<i>mr. ingram, tobey marshall.</i>
<i>1 need to borrow your mustang
to race de leon.</i>
<i>excuse me, son?</i>
<i>you want to race
my mustang in de leon?</i>
<i>what's in it for me?</i>
<i>when i win, i will give you half the cars.</i>
<i>that's around $4 million for you.</i>
<i>i'll think about it.</i>
<i>i'll call julia.</i>
all right. step forward. go. everybody.
come on. come to me.
that's my boy.
is joe in?
already on the road with the beast.
if this thing works,
we're gonna need that head start.
what about finn?
we haven't convinced him yet,
but we will. it's finn.
but more importantly'
do we even have a vehicle?
i'll know in an hour.
hey, thanks for dropping it off.
and thank ingram for me, please.
so, what do you think?
first american car to win de leon?
definitely.
you don't even have an invite.
monarch is gonna want
this car in the race.
nobody knows where
the race is until you get the invite,
so exactly where would you
be driving off to?
well, on the low,
we know it's in california,
we just don't know where.
and we also know
that one of the drivers is...
- benny.
- okay, i'll shut up.
california is quite a big state
and you might remember
that i'm a numbers girl.
okay, so what are
your numbers telling you?
there's a drivers' meeting
the night before the race.
and that means you
have 45 hours or less
to get from new york
to somewhere in california.
and your problem is...
we better get going.
it's 45 hours and counting.
whoa, whoa, whoa! hey, wait, wait!
you're not going anywhere.
you need a right-seater.
and ingram is not going
to leave this car
in the hands of an ex-con
who is about to leave
the state and break parole.
let's go.
<i>okay.</i>
maybe we can just
ditch her at a gas station or something.
hey, man. look, you want her gone?
i'll broom her ass out. okay?
just follow me, dude.
i'll have you driving like a bat out of hell.
she'll be screaming
to get out of this car.
she's just crazy, you know?
she talks too much.
okay, so you've never
been a right-seater.
well, if you see something
i'm doing wrong,
just point it out.
first of all, you're wearing high heels.
wejust call them heels.
but if it's a real problem,
then i can always...
i've got a change of
shoes in my overnight bag.
yep, okay-
so, is there anything else
that right-seaters are supposed to do?
be quiet.
<i>hello, beauty.
this is maverick speaking,</i>
<i>the most awesome pilot
in the universe.</i>
just wanted to give you a heads-up
and tell you about a little
stop-and-go traffic up ahead.
nothing too serious.
we got traffic up ahead.
we're gonna need to reroute.
i don't see any traffic.
well, benny does,
and he sees everything.
<i>al! right. now, give me
a dollar on the next exit.</i>
what's a dollar?
<i>hard right for lane three.</i>
<i>in three,</i>
two,
-one.
- uh, no.
<i>now.</i>
<i>you're looking a little
filthy down there, beauty.</i>
-lt's time to get you clean.
what?
<i>hard left u in three, two, one.</i>
oh. my god!
<i>go</i> three...
<i>now.</i>
<i>you are moving, baby!</i>
you do at least see the suv
that we are about to slam into?
you meant that one? the green one?
tobey!
- you see the bus, right?
what's that?
the bus!
the bus! the bus! the bus!
go two, now.
looks like a scene
out of speed down there.
<i>hard left in three, keanu.</i>
you mean that bus, bus, bus.
just so you know,
your friend benny sucks.
<i>hard left in one.</i>
<i>my man!</i>
<i>you got some skills, boy.
you know you bad.</i>
<i>you know you bad!</i>
beauty, it looks to me like you're
all clear from here, my friend.
that's right.
<i>i'm just gonna keep
doing my thing, and...</i>
<i>fly like an eagle, to the sea</i>
<i>fly like an eagle
let my spirit carry me</i>
<i>go on and ﬂy!</i>
you know, i get that driving fast
is going to be necessary,
but driving like a complete maniac
in order to scare me out of the car
is not going to work.
are you sure about that?
is that what you think?
whatever you think about me,
i'm sure it's wrong.
educate me.
so you think just because
i make a living buying cars
designed to triple the speed limit,
and because i drive a maserati,
and by the way, i'm an awesome driver,
that you have the right
to condescend to me?
well, this is going to be the longest
i'm not trying to be an asshole.
you don't have to try that hard.
the sound of a guy called the monarch
who hosts a secret race
is hard to believe.
he's supposedly from
an old wealthy family
that made their money
in the industrial revolution.
- and no one knows who he is?
- no one'
legend is he sponsored
a few formula one teams
but always campaigned
under other names.
a man of mystery.
mystery and a bad heart.
he had a dalliance <i>as</i> a driver,
but his head stopped
like a watch one day.
so he quit.
so what's the prize for this de leon'?
well,
big risks come with big rewards.
maybe that's why i walked away
with $6 million worth of cars.
- that sounds like a good day's work.
- yes, it was.
look, i don't mean to push you,
but i have another interested party.
i'm not 100% sure about them.
you know that feeling?
i liked what i saw at your dealership.
the problem i have is,
you haven't shown a hard profit yet.
but i thought you said the dealership
was in profits last year.
let me be blunt.
what do i have to do to get
a real commitment from you?
i'll be blunt back.
what's a real commitment?
five million.
okay, but
you have to win this
secret de leon again.
and all those cars that come with it.
yo.
<i>checking in.</i>
mile marker 417. we're on schedule.
i know we're on schedule.
i'm checking on you, bro.
i was just sitting here thinking,
pete would have loved this trip.
yeah.
he loved the impossible, huh?
perfect for petey.
<i>where's your head at, brother?</i>
i'll never forget what i saw that day.
<i>listen, don't you wow.</i>
<i>dino's gonna get what's coming to him.</i>
just don't forget why we're doing this.
i'll see you in detroit, brother. beast out.
i'm sorry about pete.
he just left him there.
that's what i can't forgive.
that's what this is really
about then, isn't it'?

- officer, i am so sorry.
-it's insane! insane.

i'm sure you could've

<i>not talking to you, beast.</i>

all of a sudden go to college, fool?
wow. what a really
ignorant thing to say.
<i>god, are you ignorant.</i>
ls it gonna be like this the entire way?
<i>a reminder, the motown marathon

this is gonna sound insane,
but i need a two-lane grasshopper
in order to get these guys off your back.

beauty will go bingo on that route,
so we're gonna have
to hot fuel and top off.
hot fuel, coming up!

"bingo" and "hot fuel"...

<i>dispatch, this is arrow one.
<i>no visual at this time.</i>
bear in the air is fangs-out down i-94.
<i>beauty, you are safe and sound.</i>

<i>all units be advised,</i>
<i>ford mustang, new york plate
adam-david-tom 4-&1-9,</i>
<i>last seen headed westbound on 94.</i>
<i>possible named suspect.</i>
<i>tobey marshall, wanted
on parole violation and gta.</i>
<i>passenger described
as a blonde, white female,</i>
<i>identity still unknown.</i>
it was just a matter of time.
yeah, well, you sped it up
with your little stunt in detroit.
it had to be done.
to get finn?
no, not just that.
kids, i'm looking at something
that i can't quite believe.
i mean, my inbox is white hot.
i got a bunch of trolls
sending me footage
of something that is mind-blowing.
i'm looking at footage
of a car that supposedly disappeared.
that's the same car
that ford and shelby were building
when carroll died.
<i>fm looking at a gorgeous ghost.</i>
<i>and i think that's
tobey marshall inside there,</i>
<i>driving a chariot of the gods.</i>
so i bow down to tobey marshall.
<i>dino brewster is
on the line right now. dino!</i>
<i>dino, dino bambino in san francisco.</i>
<i>you need to see what fm looking at.</i>
<i>i'm looking at some aerial footage
of tobey marshal!</i>
<i>ﬂying across {he country
with the cops in tow,</i>
in a phantom ford that
will make your bowels loose.
tobey marshall doing something
stupid and reckless again?
didn't that guyjust get out
of prison for manslaughter?
whoa! dino, dino' bambino.
hey, accidents happen in racing.
<i>nobody knows that better
than you, dino, remember?</i>
i just don't wanna
see him race at de leon.
you know, in fact,
i'm willing to give up my...
i'm willing to give up my elemento
to anyone that puts a stop
to tobey marshall.
wait a minute.
wait a minute,
did you just say what i think you said?
that car is one of three in the world.
<i>you're willing to give away
your lamborghini</i>
<i>to stop tobey marshall?</i>
yes, lam. and i'm gonna
post some pictures online
so everybody knows
exactly what they're looking for.
<i>this is too good.</i>
<i>1' got star-crossed lovers
hauling ass across the country.</i>
<i>i got dino brewster, who just painted</i>
a <i>huge bull's-eye on their ass.</i>
<i>man. christmas came early, wing nuts.</i>
the thing you gotta understand is,
racing is an art.
douchebag is out here,
he wants to talk to you.
racing with passion...
dude, that's high art.
<i>man, i can feel love and vengeance</i>
<i>and smell motor oil
all swirling together out there.</i>
<i>we got supernatural mustangs,
we got personal vendettas.</i>
<i>i have no idea where this is going.
i just know i like it. i like it</i> a <i>lot!</i>
call in, defend yourself.
everyone knows my story.
<i>go ahead.</i>
monarch, this is the blonde female
sitting right next to tobey marshall.
really? okay.
we got a girl with a fake british accent,
claiming she's sitting
next to tobey marshall.
<i>having a spot of tea, are you, dove?</i>
there were three cars in the race
the day that pete died, that's a fact.
and anyone that says
that tobey is responsible
for pete's death, answer this.
why jump parole in new york
knowing that you are going to be
re-arrested and do serious time,
unless you are innocent
and hell-bent to right a wrong?
he did the time, he paid the debts,
why would he risk it'?
<i>next time you talk to dino,
you can ask him that question.</i>
thank you.
you're welcome.
<i>i like this girl.</i>
<i>yeah! yeah!</i>
yeah, the british are coming.
i gotta tell you, i'm moved. lam.
the whole thing just went
right here to the old ticker.
i gotta pop one of these.
yeah.
this is getting good.
i believe you, you crazy little tart.
<i>tobey marshall versus dino brewster.</i>
that's a deep rivalry right there.
yeah. i hear you, honey. i hear you.
the two of you out there,
flying across the country
at killer speeds to prove something
while you're tearing up
the american asphalt.
born to run, baby. born to run.
<i>t obey marsha“,</i>
<i>welcome to the de leon.</i>
that's it, cretins,
de leon is full.
but if you want
dino brewsteﬂs lamborghini,
you're gonna have to
chase down that mustang to get it.
wow.
the race before the race.
i love it.
<i>beauty!</i>
congrats on the wild card
to the rodeo, my friend.
<i>your mute is clear
to the nebraska border.</i>
<i>darkness is upon us,</i>
<i>so the eyes in the sky
