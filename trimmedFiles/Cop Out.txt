here and you bullshitting on the ground.
man:
monroe and hodges.
monroe and hodges.
you know, there's a right way
of doing police work.
there's a wrong way of doing it.
then there's a way
that you two idiots do it.
thank you, captain.
romans:
what happened, jimmy?
it just went south.
right away.
the whole thing went south, jack.
these new mexican gangs,
they got no style, they got no class.
- they shoot first and run second.
- you should've coordinated with anti-gang.
you kidding?
the guy says it's happening right now.
- we had to make a right-now move.
- anti-gang and occb...
...have been sitting on that neighborhood.
one call would have told you.
- details never matter.
- they don't return calls.
i've got waves
of mexican gang members moving in...
...bringing shipments of dope
to that neighborhood from canada.
the mexicans fly the dope to canada
and bring it through toronto.
because of the heightened security
along the southern border.
really?
that's how they get it done, huh?
- you looked confused about it.
- i am.
that neighborhood is dead to me.
good job.
the good news, captain? we're fine.
the good news is you're suspended.
thirty days without pay.
what? suspended without pay?
what the fuck, jack?
- dead informant, neighborhood shot up...
- you kidding?
- i got you two burning a sting.
- we didn't...
i got nitwit here being filmed beating
up a kid and then stealing his bike.
nitwit here almost got his ass shot off.
you beat up a kid?
- i needed the bike.
- you can see it on youtube if you want.
- really? what, the youtube?
- good job.
- how many hits i get?
romans: well, there's at least two:
the chief of police and the deputy chief.
your suspensions are effective
immediately. get out.
jack. jack, you remember ava, right?
- my daughter, ava? right?
- i know her, jimmy.
you came to her christening?
guess what,
she's gonna get married in six weeks.
i'm counting on this money
to pay for the wedding.
- i don't care.
- you don't care?
do what you gotta do.
badges and guns, give them up.
- jack.
romans: badges and guns, i said.
- if you're gonna make me beg, i'll beg.
romans: give them up.
you heard what i said, jimmy.
jesus christ, jack.
nice. nice.
- captain, your heart, it's a icebox.
- get out.
[glass shatters]
- should've ripped off that gumby suit.
- maybe i was getting mauled by a pit bull.
since when is it possible for a man
to outrun a car?
- you are not the six million dollar man.
- i got hit by a geo metro.
it's gas on the right,
brakes on the left, miss daisy.
who gets hit by a geo metro?
so don't blame me for this bullshit.
- fuck you.
- fuck you.
you.
- you guys are fantastic.
- gifted, even.
to destroy a whole month
of our undercover work in mere minutes...
...takes genius-level stupid.
hunsaker:
every player we got eyes on disappears...
...when you start your
bang-bang shoot-shoot, huh?
mangold: now, here's an idea.
you check an assignment board.
[phone ringing]
you make a call.
you do not scramble another cop's eggs.
- ever.
jimmy: i hate these calls at work.
i gotta take this. excuse me. hello?
- hey, jimmy, what's up?
- hey.
- it's me, paul.
- what's going on?
paul:
you see who's standing in front of us?
jimmy:
mangold and hunsaker.
you ever notice that hunsaker smells like
you gotta see their wives, man.
hunsaker, his wife got three teeth
and two of those is in her pocket.
- oh!
paul: she got one titty missing a nipple.
they made a movie about these two.
- kevin costner and robert de niro.
- what was it called?
- the unfuckables.
- the unfuckables. i love that movie.
i'm not gonna lie, i like the idea of kevin
costner and robert de niro playing us.
- [imitating de niro] little bit.
- mangold's wife is very unhappy.
she said he's all foreskin.
- hey.
- that's actually clever.
i'd love to talk about these guys
but i gotta run.
- cool stuff. later.
- i'll see you at the house.
i'm sorry, unrelated business.
what were you saying?
you were right to kill that snitch.
and i'm glad you're okay.
you remember sister theresa
who taught fifth grade?
yeah, she was way too fine to be a nun.
[in spanish]
poh boy:
she was cool, though.
taught me how to throw
a sick breaking slider.
those putos are late
with my mercedes, homes.
once that mercedes
is delivered to me...
...and i get that dead motherfucker's
supply chain and bank accounts...
...we gonna expand our drug trade
out of brooklyn.
take it across the whole east coast.
and after that...
...we buying a farm team, juan.
i'm sorry, poh boy.
hector and tapas stopped to get gas
after driving all night.
and when they came out...
...the mercedes was stolen.
you told me to hire those guys.
you told me the car would be safe
in their hands.
[julio speaks in spanish]
i will deal with tapas and hector myself,
right away.
[speaking in spanish]
bless me, father...
...for i'm about to sin.
[gunshot]
[body thuds]
paul:
can i put the cherry on top of the car?
jimmy: no.
paul: you just made me sad.
shit.
i can't go in there
and tell them i got suspended.
you don't have to.
it's my favorite gun, jimmy.
take care of her.
thanks, paul.
- what are you doing with all these badges?
- i lose them a lot.
uncle paul!
[both laughing]
hey, baby. what's up?
you're doing it, huh? you're doing it.
- pam! mama bear. looking good.
- hello, paul.
ava: hi, daddy.
paul: god, you look good, girl.
- you look good, girl.
- why, thank you, sir.
- i don't know who you are. getting married.
ava: i'm getting married.
oh, man, i can't believe it. i gotta go.
i'm sorry. poof. disappear.
but i love you like the fat kid love cake.
if it comes to it, i got it. okay?
paul: see you later.
- i love you.
- i love you.
- okay.
well, let's go.
tell me everything. i'm excited.
- hey. things going well?
- yeah.
- you excited?
- yes.
- still getting married?
- yeah.
- remember what we talked about. okay?
- he's gonna rain on the parade...
...like he always does.
- amazing band.
- what's the name of the band?
- the virgins.
they're a little edgy for the ceremony.
so we just need the deposit checks
to send out to hold everything.
- let me see the list.
ava: it's pretty cheap, actually.
yeah.
ava: it's not much if you look
at everything we're getting.
cheap.
jimmy, um...
...i know 48,000 seems like a lot, but...
...as dream weddings go,
it's actually pretty modest.
and if you're okay with it...
...l'd really love to do this for ava.
do what, exactly, roy?
pay for the wedding, jimmy.
well, that's generous.
- would you guys give us a second?
- daddy.
- jimmy.
jimmy: we just wanna talk.
- we hardly ever get to talk.
- it's okay.
- go get a drink at the bar.
- be nice.
get your mom a drink.
look at her, stressed out.
- what are you drinking?
- scotch.
rum? nice.
- rum on the rocks for your stepfather.
- it's fine.
- and i'm just gonna have some water.
- okay, daddy.
- you look beautiful. you really do.
- thank you.
you both look great.
you know i'm a cop, right?
that i work for the n.y.p. d?
they give me a gun with bullets.
i gotta go out every day,
chase bad guys, try and catch them.
all kinds of bad guys:
rapists, drug dealers, burglars.
but you know what the worst kind
of bad guy is in my book?
it's somebody that would try to
humiliate a father...
...in front of his own daughter.
his little girl.
- that it?
- yeah, that's it.
- it was good.
- thanks.
listen, jimmy.
ava's like a daughter to me.
she's not your daughter.
she's my daughter.
well, that's why i said "like a daughter."
and it's my job...
...to make sure she and pam
get anything they want.
i'm the second husband.
[laughs]
and $50,000 for ava's happiness...
...that's nothing to me.
you know, that's a weekend in vegas.
now, if you can't afford
to pay for your daughter's wedding...
...i will.
because a deadbeat ex-husband...
...who never had to pay any alimony...
...you're welcome, by the way...
...and can't pay
for his only daughter's wedding?
ooh. to me? that's a bad guy.
so why don't you go ahead...
...and keep your little promise
to the great city of new york.
take that gun of yours...
...and shoot yourself, serpico.
- daddy? can i talk to you?
- of course. of course.
excuse me, roy.
prick.
i don't have to have the big wedding
if it's too much.
we can just have something small
with a few friends.
oh, baby, come here.
are you kidding me?
you are gonna have the wedding
that you always wanted.
big, all your friends, everybody.
even your mom's gonna be happy.
stop worrying, all right?
- really?
- really.
- are you sure?
- yes.
because i really want a big wedding.
you're gonna get a big wedding.
what'd i tell you?
gotta stop listening to this
knucklehead.
- is he looking at me right now?
- mm-hm.
fuck him.
what the fuck?
what the...?
mother...
hey, big al, how you doing?
jimmy monroe.
listen, i gotta sell the pafko.
see if you can find a buyer for me,
all right?
good morning, deborah.
good morning, paul.
is this yours from last night?
you got me, paul.
i was celebrating
because i finally closed the ramen account.
i forgot.
noodles every day, every hour of the day,
and you just forgot?
don't change the subject.
did you drink this bottle of champagne
by yourself?
no, i didn't. i had some help.
- who?
- henry.
- henry?
- henry.
- our neighbor, next door?
- henry, the next door neighbor.
how he get involved in our celebration?
our celebration? you weren't even here.
i'm doing that thing again, right?
- paul.
- but, baby, you my tenderoni.
- and i get insecure.
- i know that i'm lucky to have you.
i love you and i married you because
you're funny, and you're smart.
and i'm orally fixated.
that's going too far.
you have no need to be jealous
of henry or anybody else, okay?
i'm yours. you have to believe that.
you know you got me open
like a research monkey?
- i don't know what that means.
- can i get some?
i love you, booby. give me some of that.
hi.
hi, henry.
i'm gonna go take a shower.
i'll see you tonight.
you gonna be my eyes, little bear.
what's with the box?
gotta sell the pafko.
i heard that. i know that's right.
- i'm lying. what's a pafko?
- it's a baseball card.
baseball card?
- jim, listen, if you need 20 bucks, i got...
- asshole, i don't need 20 bucks.
i'm selling it
to cover my daughter's wedding.
so how much is that thing worth?
jimmy:
well, it's a gem mint 10 andy pafko.
in 1952, when the topps gum company
came out with the first baseball cards...
...andy pafko was number one,
the first card in that set.
kids would collect the cards, right?
then they'd stack them up,
wrap rubber bands around them.
my pop...
...never wrapped rubber bands
around his cards.
loved andy pafko.
always took good care of him.
about four or five years ago, they sold one
of these at auction for about $83,000.
eighty-three thousand grand?
yeah. my daughter's wedding's gonna
cost 48,000.
you're about to come off like a fat rat
in a cheese factory, jim.
yeah, that's if we get 80.
i'd rather chew my own arm off than to
have that guy roy...
...stand up and take credit for it all.
- i hear you.
i'm gonna stay out here
and i'm gonna call debbie.
oh, good.
big al.
mr. monroe.
- is that it? is that the pafko?
- yeah. that's it.
just got off the phone with a buyer
and he's gotta have it.
and i just have to appraise it.
can i take it out?
- you're talking about the card, right?
- for the next four weeks, fuck this job.
i'm coming home to you. it's gonna be
me and you. we gonna get freaky.
careful with the edge.
you're not gonna take it out...
[grunts]
- open up the register. open it.
- but l...
dave. you want me to grab the cards?
put your mask back on.
dave: he's calling me dave
because it's not my real name.
just grab anything that looks old.
he pays big for old shit like this.
paul. paul.
- paul. jesus.
- i just wanna get you pregnant.
you know, my daughter come out,
she be like 11 pounds, 20 ounces.
you know, running around the house
with the doo-doo pamper on.
- this guy's got a gun.
- what?
i'm a cop.
[taser buzzes]
jimmy: ah!
- now i'm a cop.
now, i need to see you.
i just wanna be home with you. you know?
i'll start everything right now, you know?
hey!
- hey!
- jimmy, i'm on the phone.
mangold:
mr. monroe...
...we are the police. we're here to help.
now, you've been the victim of a crime,
do you understand?
i don't have time for this shit.
whoa. whoa, guy.
based on the emotional state, how should
we proceed? what do you think?
we get him a psych evaluation.
we're gonna take you to bellevue...
...just to make sure you're okay.
hunsaker:
now, for the record...
...how long, actually, have you been a...
...hobbyist?
mangold: now, were there
any identifying marks on the suspects?
nope.
paul: okay, seven robberies,
all with similar m.o.s.
all in queens, five in far rockaway.
it just got me to thinking
maybe our guy...
...got his tattoo from a local parlor
in the neighborhood.
now, here comes the genius.
check it out. bust it, it might blind you.
this is the stuff my mother used
to tell her friends about.
"my son is a genius.
my son is a genius. he's a genius."
i called all the local parlors,
using the robberies as a radius...
...and i think i got one guy that says
he might have given somebody...
...a wiener dog surfer tattoo
on his forearm.
ah! what the fuck, man?
it's a cartoon dog surfing on his forearm.
why don't you tell my partner
who dave is...
...before he draws two unicorns
fucking on your face.
- give it up.
- dave owes me money.
says he's gonna pay
after he hits this house tonight.
he's been casing one on the beach.
in rockaway.
that's all i know, man. that's all i know.
paul: it just keeps ringing and ringing and
ringing. i mean, where the hell is she?
jimmy:
just relax.
paul: four fifteen in the morning
and she doesn't pick up?
ask any cop, his wife is sleeping
with the phone next to the pillow...
...just in case something happens.
she's probably with that henry.
i am not doing this shit again.
jesus.
- who's this henry guy?
- he's our neighbor.
every morning when debbie
takes the trash out...
...this henry guy
happens to take his trash out.
"oh, debbie, debbie, debbie,
you look wonderful.
how about you come over.
really? he's working all night?"
"why don't you come over around 11.
while he's putting his life on the line,
i could dickey-do you from behind."
- dickey-do?
- fucking monocle-wearing motherfucker.
- know what? i'm calling debbie.
- give me that. give me the phone.
- give it back, jim. give me my phone.
- i'm not giving it back.
sick of this paranoid,
"my wife is fucking around on me" bullshit.
- it's driving me fucking crazy.
- i promise i won't call her.
if you're not gonna call,
then you don't need the phone, do you?
- give me my phone, jim.
- i'm not gonna... man, what...?
get off. i swear to god...
- you better get off of me.
- give me the phone.
- give me my phone.
- head down, i said.
get your head... what, you happy now?
jesus christ. you're a fucking child.
oh, man.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
paul: what? what's going on?
- yo, what is that? look at this.
- unbelievable.
- let me see.
they're on the roof.
what the fuck is that?
paul:
that's called parkour.
it's a french martial art
to get you around and over stuff.
what are you, wikipedia?
- got sand in the binoculars.
- that's because you put it on my face.
jimmy:
we lost him now. wait a minute.
- oh, man.
- what?
jimmy: are you kidding me?
- what?
he's taking a shit in the house.
look. upstairs. where the light is.
oh, shit. he's taking a shit in the house.
what kind of guy takes a shit
in the same house that he's robbing?
i don't know. what kind of guy takes a
shit in a high-pressure situation like this?
i'm not shitting nowhere
except for my house.
i will pinch it in my ass for hours
before i let it go.
but when i let it go, here, she blows.
here, she blows.
the big brown shark is gonna come.
i set records with my shit turds.
i move my bowels all over my toilet.

"warriors, come out and play."
jimmy:

how can i be of service to you, officers?
i want my baseball card.
- what card might that be?
- don't play cute with us.
and don't you raise your voice
in my house.
because if such a card exists, then...
...you know,
it might easily get destroyed.
- so you do have it.
poh boy: i ain't say that.
what if someone did?
are we still playing what-ifs?
all right, what if you had to
make some sort of deal to get it back?
what if we arrest your ass?
what if your house caught on fire?
what if your andy pafko card...
...accidentally falls
into a running garbage disposal?
i think i just had the scariest
"what if," homes.
what kind of deal you talking about?
deal. man. let's call it a favor.
- nothing illegal.
poh boy: no.
no, someone stole my vehicle, officer.
this car has tremendous
sentimental value to me.
all i want is for you to do
what cops are supposed to do...
...and find my fucking car.
- so the car for the card.
poh boy: if you could get me my car back...
...then perhaps señor pafko makes his
way back to you.
- and safe at home.
- oh, fuck this.
give us the card, or i'm gonna go
berserk in this motherfucker.
watch this, man. boys.
you like that?
yeah, we practiced that shit for an hour.
so shoot. go ahead.
you might get me.
jimmy:
so...
...what kind of car are we talking about?
poh boy:
those the two from the phone store?
juan [in spanish]:
calculated risk, baby brother.
i need that car.
so you follow them.
paul:
you know the bonobo chimpanzee...
...is the only non-human primate
that has oral sex?
jimmy: where do you find the time
to watch the animal planet?
i'm with you 25 hours a day.
i have to feed this.
i have to feed this, okay?
well, you're a compendium
of fucking useless information.
well, i don't wanna look at reality tv
because that's the bowels of hollywood.
i fucking hate reality tv.
you're right, it fucking blows.
and i like to see chimpanzees
getting head.
you got a point.
[car alarm beeping]

i'm gonna throw you in the river.
- sick of this. let's go.

broke-ass bitch. yo.
whoa. tongues are cut out.
hunsaker: yeah, that's a big thing
with the latin gangs.
they like to remove the tongues
so you can't repent your sins...
...to jesus in the afterlife.
so, what are these boys?
salvadoran? honduran?
rudels. that makes them
mexican nationals.
intricate stitching, higher heel,
skin usually of an endangered species.

i know boots.
mangold: those are great.
hunsaker: thank you.
mangold:
i might be thinking about getting a pair.
- no, sir. these boots would wear you.
- you don't mean that.
let me ask you a question, cop-to-cop.
what size do you think those are?
i'm a 10.
you might wanna...
[spits]
never wear a dead man's boots.
that is a world of bad luck
you do not want a part of.
sorry. and thank you.
so, maybe we should find out what got
these hombres in so much hot salsa.
hunsaker:
gentlemen.
paul: still don't understand how he got
the rooster to play the piano.
jimmy: he just puts a little chicken feed on
the keys that he wants the chicken to peck...
...so he can play a song.
- it's not that complicated.
paul: i'm gonna be the bad guy.
no, you're not. you fucked up
your whole performance last time.
bullshit. i was totally believable.
[in spanish]
paul: i've been working on my acting.
jimmy: that's not acting.
paul:

manuel: she went to the police...
...and they tried to kill her in her home.
they killed her sister.
her brother, he paid a man
to get her across the border.
when she was going across,
that coyote sold her out.
some men put her in a plane.
then they put her in the trunk in a car
for two days.
and you know the rest.
i'll be right back.
jimmy:
get me a shirt, will you?
so my daughter's getting married.
it's a guy named ronald.
he's nice to her,
he's nice to my daughter.
when my daughter was born, the first thing
that she did, the moment she was born...
...she winked at me.
can you imagine that?
a little infant doing that?
she was trying to tell me
everything was gonna be all right.
always made it easy for me.
even in divorce.
always made it easy. easy-going kid.
really...
i just want her to be happy, that's all.
her mother thinks i'm a jerk-off.
she hates me.
that's why i gotta get this card back.
you know, i just gotta...
one time, i gotta do the right thing...
...and give my daughter this wedding
that she wants.
and then i won't look like such a jerk.
you know what i mean?
jimmy.
okay.
jimmy:
how many guns did you get?
this is the hidden nanny cam
that i had in my bedroom.
and i can't watch what's on here
so i need you to press play.
no.
no fucking way.
- come on, jimmy.
- i am not looking at that.
you are insane, paul.
you have a wife in that house
that loves you.
and you put a camera in her bedroom.
you have actually gone nuts.
but i'll tell you something right now,
i'm not looking at it.
no.
- please?
jimmy: no.
please?
don't show me the bear.
hey, honey.

- you don't even know what she said.
- neither do you. put the fucking bear down.
you know what she said?
she said, "please, jimbo.
please look at what's on there,
on this tape.
my master's hurting so bad in his heart.
- please?"
- you've lost your mind.
you are insane.
i'm gonna regret this, i know it.
- there's nothing on here.
- yes.
- yes. yes, you mother...
- here.
take your bear, take your bear.
put it in the bag.
- can we go now?
- yeah.
paul:
yeah. hey, thanks a lot, buddy. okay.
that was my guy at the fbi.
he says he can help,
but he can't be here for another 24 hours.
so until then,
we watch the girl and wait.
so i guess i just
kiss my card goodbye, huh?
- jimmy, forget about the card for now.
- think i'm gonna forget ava's wedding?
you know i want ava to have the wedding
that she wants. but right now...
...my focus is on keeping gabriela alive.
- think i'm not?
not when every word coming out of your
mouth is, "my card, my card, my card."
[phone ringing]
jimmy, we're not done yet.
- yeah.
- jimmy, it's hunsak...
- it's barry mangold. i'm here too, brother.
- nice. you know what time it is?
hunsaker: listen, we found a gun
on a known murderer.
way to go, sherlocks.
it's registered to your partner.
we know paul's dirty.
meet us at the ladder in 20 minutes.
yeah.
all right.
going after the card, aren't you?
- i'm not gonna do this with you now, paul.
paul: chrissakes, jim.
ava will be just as happy
if you let roy and pam pay for the wedding.
- just stay here and watch the girl.
- what if poh boy put a tail on you?
i'm not gonna let you
jeopardize gabriela's safety.
you stay here or you stay away.
- don't know what you're talking about, paul.
- hey, jim.
- he came.
hunsaker: he had to.
up past your bedtime, huh, mangold?
- zing.
- all right. thanks for coming, jimmy.
we need your help on something.
i need to know if you're aware...
...that your partner's piece
was used on a hit of a mexican national.
he's playing coy.
paul's gun was found...
...in the dead hand of one juan diaz.
juan was the shooter from
the cell phone store, you may remember.
- got himself an older brother.
mangold: poh boy.
which is fun to say.
his name is poh boy and
he's looking to expand his drug business.
mangold:
he's looking for any help he can get.
including cops.
just wanna know if you're aware
of the situation...
...that your partner has gotten you into.
help us help you.
think of us like your diary.
you guys are just out here
playing cops and robbers, aren't you?
got your guns, your badges...
...your cute little boots.
but really you don't have any idea
what's going on.
if you ever try to play me
against my partner again, i will fuck you up.
you first.
you should know better.
[paul snoring]
hi.
[in english]
i think i should tell you something.
this is real nice,
but nothing is gonna happen between us.
see, i'm married. and i love her.
[in spanish]
i have feelings for you too.
not that i don't want anything
to happen between us.
i think you're beautiful and sexy.
and you probably even got a bit of a nasty
streak when it comes to the bang-bang.
[in english]
bang-bang.
yeah. but nothing is gonna happen.
[in spanish]
i hope you can respect that.
hey. hey, wait a minute. what? what?
i didn't mean anything about the whole
bang-bang thing.
no, i can't get in the shower with you.

i've been where you are.
roy?
yeah.

- look like you need a hug.
- whoa, you really read that one wrong.
- it's just that i'm vulnerable.
- how long's she been in there?
i don't know. does this mean
that we're not broken up anymore?
what are you, in the fifth grade?
you're my partner.
how long's she been in here?

bandit gave poh boy my gun? that blows.
jimmy:
hey.
police. we need to use your computer.
well, i don't know.
i'm just a night manager...
...and for something like that,
i'd probably have to call...
...and get an okay from the general manager

paul: know what i'm thinking?
poh boy never wanted gabriela.

she's very afraid for you. the note says:
"i have put you in danger.
you should not die because of me.
thank you for your help.
you were sweet like chocolate."
i think she's talking...
...to you.
jimmy:
okay. i got an apb out on gabriela.
we got one hour
while poh boy's at his brother's funeral...
...to break into his house and get my card.
paul: how?
dave: you're not very chatty, darnell.

i'm just, like,
a social butterfly by nature, you know?

poopsie. the window you're gonna break in
in this house is on the second floor.
yeah, second-story window. no problem.
we're only gonna have about 30 to 40
minutes with the house empty.
i need you to get in there and get up to the
second floor where his diamond vault is.
probably where he keeps the card.
it's gonna be easier
than giving paul's wife an atm.
ass to mouth.
he said ass to mouth.
yo, that shit's not funny, man.
- his wife really is cheating on him.
- wait, what?

oh! i feel terrible now.
how are you gonna deal with this,
paul, emotionally?
i don't know. i'm not sure.
hey.
don't you give up on love, paul,
you hear me?
- don't you give up on love. okay?
- i almost gave up.

paul: no, i ain't giving up.

paul: oh, shit. he ain't moving.
- hop in there and check his pulse.
i'm not hopping in there
and doing nothing.
- you're not gonna help?
- it was your baseball card.
he was your friend.
you were making out in the car.
but that don't mean
i need to hop over there.
jimmy:
you're no help at all, paul, really.
- i can't feel a pulse.
- are you doing it right?
- yes, i'm doing it right. he must be dead.
- he can't be dead.
- goddamn it. i was counting on this kid.
- he looks like a little angel.
what are we gonna do with him?
- let's just throw him in a dumpster.
- what? no.
he's not a piece of trash that you just
throw in a dumpster. he was my friend.
- be right back.
- where are you going?
- to get my card.
- are you crazy?
we gotta get out of here before these
people get back...
...and we still gotta find gabriela.
we got 20 minutes.
i'll be in and out. give me a boost.
boost? with all due respect, jimmy,

jimmy:

paul: what?

you stepped on my forehead, jimmy.

mangold: you know, i've been thinking.
hunsaker: uh-huh.
poh boy? we only have his dead brother
as a connection to the killings.
you know, we don't actually have
anything that implicates poh boy directly.
more importantly, nothing that ties
jimmy and paul to poh boy.
- that's the balls.
- why don't we go directly to the source.
why don't we put the squeeze on this
poh boy son of a bitch...
...until he makes us

hunsaker:

from killing all your friends?
you should have quit
while you was ahead, homey.

[in spanish]
on three.
poh boy [in english]:
man, you ain't gonna shoot nobody, man.
that's right, you ain't got the fucking balls.
that's one, two, shoot on three?
or one, two, three, then shoot?
- one, two, three, then shoot.
paul: there you go getting mad.
- always one, two, three, then shoot.
- i'm not good at math.
[in spanish]
- [in english] come on, man.

mangold:

hunsaker: it's all right, kid.

mangold: want me to ride with you
in case you die?
i want you to stay here
and finish the job.

go check it out.
coroner: be quick about it, huh?
i got a week's worth of dead.

for five seconds.

el poh boy.
"corazón" means "heart."
gabriela hipped me to that.

you didn't shoot him in the
corazón, okay?
- you must have shot him in the shoulder.
- i shot him in the heart. you crazy?
excellent shot, right there.
so i got shot too, you know?
only reason why i ain't passed out yet
is because i wanted...
that ain't my shot.
no, that ain't my shot.
there's muscle memory at the academy.
they teach you, better aim for the arteries
and stuff like that. that ain't my shot.
i'm sorry, jim. jimmy, i'm sorry.
i didn't mean it.
[paul sobbing]

if god created anything better than you,
he keeping it for his mother-loving self.
jimmy: nice seeing you.
- take care, pam.

- i'm glad you're in a really good mood.
- yeah, i'm in a great mood.
- i wanna ask you a little favor.
- okay.
i want you to let roy give ava away
with you.
when the priest says,
"who gives this woman away?"
you and roy both stand up and you say
together, "we do."
come on, that's fair.
he's paying for the wedding.
are you high?
you're gonna do this for me, jimmy,
because you owe me.
because if you don't...
...if you ruin my daughter's wedding day
for me, the way you did everything else...
...i will rip your fucking balls off.
- hey, you.
- hey.
- you need anything, baby?
- no, thanks, i'm fine.
oh, you sure are.
- you like your necklace?
- oh, yeah, i love it.

where that came from.

me things.
i love you and i forgive you.
you just need to pull that jealousy thing
way back.
thank you. and i love you.
and you look so pretty and sweet,
like bambi.
priest: "the lord is my shepherd,
i shall not want.
he maketh me lie down
in green pastures.
he leadeth me beside still waters.
he leadeth me in the path of
righteousness for his namesake.
when i was a child,
i spoke as a child...
...i understood as a child,
i thought as a child.
but when i became man,
i put away childish things.
faith, hope, and love...
...these three.
but the greatest of these is love."
and who gives this bride away?
hey, hey, hey. sit down. sit down.
stand up and i'll blow
your fucking kidneys out. all right?
he should probably do it.
priest:
and who gives this bride away?
i do.
i love you.
[phone rings]
hello?
- hey, sweetie.
man: hi, sweetie.
so, um...
...i was thinking we could go out to dinner.
man: oh, dinner. where are we going?
could you hang on
for just a sec, hon? thanks.
- hello?
man [in high-pitched voice]: hello?

man [in deep voice]:
