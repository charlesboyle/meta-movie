a bit rough, if you know what i mean.
- ibiza.
- yeah.
thanks.
when i was a kid,
my father used to take me fishing.
never could figure out how he knew
where the fish were.
they were always exactly
where he said they would be.
security check.
do i look like a security risk?
please step out of the car and bring
your documents to the office.
my documents are right here, sir.
the computer is in the office.

i have been fishing these waters
since before you were born.
you were close, inspector.
you were close.
good thing that we french have such
a highly developed sense of humor.
with all due respect, the french
think jerry lewis is a genius.
- jerry lewis is a genius.
- dean was the genius.
no, dean just stood there
with a drink and a cigarette.
my point exactly.
anyone can fall down and get a laugh.
how many people can do it standing
still with a drink and a cigarette?
i am afraid our day of leisure
is cut short.
there is a mess in marseilles.
some madman driving an audi
at impossible speeds.
don't look at me.
that is the first place
the chief told me to look.
but i will tell him
you have the perfect alibi.
as usual.
tarconi!
- please!
- i am sorry, frank.
- it's our first bite!
- yeah, yeah.
- please.
- yeah.
stop the boat. come on.
- no. no, frank.
- come on, please.
purpose of your visit, mr. johnson?
business.
what kind of business?
environmental protection.
thank you.
mr. minister, you're giving the opening
address at an eu conference...
...on environmental impact of industry
in odessa tomorrow.
- what is top on your list of priorities?
- it's a short list.
there's one item: the environment
and how to protect it.
in the face of increasing pressure...
...for industries to compete
successfully in a global economy...
...that goal can sometimes come up
against some very harsh realities.
well, not as harsh as
a polluted and uninhabitable planet.
gentlemen, if you'll excuse me now...
...i have trees to save
and industrialists to disappoint.
- your speech for tomorrow.
- any good?
- it's going to piss off a lot of people.
- excellent.
hello?
mr. minister?
who is this?
my name is not important.
i've been put in charge of
the negotiations...
...you are engaged in with ecocorp...
...for issuance of their license
to do business in the ukraine.
you must be misinformed,
mr. whatever-your-name-is.
i've terminated negotiations
permanently.
i think you will reconsider
that position...
...once you have a chance to study
the documents in the envelope.
i'll be in touch.
yeah, there's been an accident.
send an ambulance,
malcolm.
malcolm. malcolm.
i asked you for your price.
what is this?
a man who might be interested
in taking the job. this man will.
my boss said you're the man
for the job.
your boss got his facts wrong.
two things you should know
about my boss:
he never gets his facts wrong,
he never takes no for an answer.
well, there's a first time
for everything.
well, not this time.
you don't wanna do this.
i don't think you're in a position to
tell me what i do and don't wanna do.
you have 10 seconds
to change your mind.
i'll give you five seconds
to remove your hand.
malcolm. malcolm.
you hear me?
mal, i said drop in anytime,
but i didn't mean...
- nowhere else to go.
- just take it easy, okay?
don't move me from the car.
- it's just till the ambulance arrives.
- no ambulance.
you need a doctor, you've been shot.
i can't take care of this.
not far from car.
relax.
just try to stay calm.
we'll have you fixed up in no time.
he's inside. quick, it's serious.
sir?
- you wanna be careful moving him.
- we know our job, okay?
sir, can you hear me?
this car... no...
if you hear me, press my hand.
the car...
am i in heaven?
actually, you're in a bit of the shit.
you'll help me out of it?
that depends on
how deep you're in.
- don't trust anyone.
- couldn't agree with you more.
- come on.
- no! don't leave the car!
- what's so special about the car?
- not the car.
wait!
i told you.
<i>don't trust anyone.</i>
<i>i told you.</i>
i took the liberty
of bringing your suit.
it's what you wear when
you're working, correct?
correct. but i'm not working.
- you see, boss? i told you.
- please, joseph.
your approach was not very effective in
presenting our proposal the first time.
thank you.
as i was saying...
...we came to you in good faith.
you said you were unavailable.
we contracted with the man
whose number you gave us.
he proved to be ineffective.
and now i am left
with unfinished business.
the way i see it, you're responsible.
i understand your point of view.
but i'm still unavailable.
boss, can i say something?
anyone else wanna say something?
good.
find me a smarter one.
you have three seconds
to change your mind...
...or you're gonna
be permanently unavailable.
one.
two.
one condition.
i'm listening.
i drive my own car.
deal.
in anticipation of your answer, we took
the liberty of bringing your car.
changed the oil, gave it a tune-up,
took out all the non-essential material.
left the switch-over license plates.
love that.
replaced the gps
with one of our own.
preprogrammed.
more efficient that way.
why i was so insistent on using only
the best man for this assignment?
we're playing
in a much larger game here.
don't think of this as just another job.
think of it as a mission.
i'm so pleased to find we share
the same approach to our work.
i make a deal, that's the deal.
just like you.
you don't like names. neither do i.
we're both precise.
neither one of us has any interest
in what we're paid to do...
...beyond what we are paid to do.
those are your rules, right?
you forgot one.
- i work alone.
- i thought you might like the company.
thought you wanted me
to complete a mission.
you're right. i do.
wait.
what, you wanna change the rules?
every rule has an exception.
let's make one for today.
you're the boss.
anything else?
the jewelry.
anything i should know?
you remember those jokers
trying to blow up airliners...
...by sneaking liquids through
and combining them onboard?
same principle, just refined.
twenty-five feet from the car...
...yellow light comes on,
signaling the first liquid is ready.
fifty feet, orange.
second liquid
flows into the chamber.
seventy-five feet,
you're gonna see red.
time to go.
this phone is programmed
to call only one number, mine.
when you pass the first toll on the
road going north, call me, all right?
money for gas and food.
any other questions?
would you mind
buckling your seat belt?
don't suppose you wanna tell me
what this is all about?
great.
ocean pearl
requesting cargo clearance.
the papers are with
the environmental agency.
drop anchor and wait to dock.
- we'll inform you when they're signed.
- okay.
i know what happened to you.
but what happened to frank?
colonel medved over at intelligence
has been given all the information.
he knows it's top priority.
he wants you to know
he has his best men on it.
he'll keep it out of official channels.
he suggests you buy
as much time as you can.
look, i don't know what your part in all
this is or isn't. and i don't really care.
you were here first,
you know more than i do...
...download me on what you know.
i know nothing.
how did you know malcolm?
i didn't.
you just happened to end up in a car
with a man you don't know?
i'm now in a car
with man i don't know.
aren't you supposed to make a call?
<i>nice to hear from you.</i>
you can skip the pleasantries.
just give me the code.
<i>1- 1- 2-6.</i>
<i>call me when you arrive.</i>
what's in budapest?
goulash. beer.
all right.
let's rewind here,
start with the proper introductions.
what happened
to the rule of no names?
i'm suspending that rule
for the moment.
i'm frank martin.
and your name is?
what matters, my name?
well, we're in this situation together.
no.
we're sitting here with two exploding
bracelets on, going to the same place.
i'd call that being
in the same situation.
it's not. they are going to kill you.
i'm aware of that.
in all probability, after they kill me,
you're next on the list.
now, if i'm gonna keep that from
happening, i'm gonna need a little help.
from the top. we have this problem.
you think i don't know
it's a problem?
i look stupid to you?
i didn't say you were stupid.
but we have a problem...
...and you're not being very helpful
in participating in the solution of it.
i don't want to talk anymore.
fine.
what did you say your name was?
frank. frank martin.
frank martin.
valentina.
pleased to meet you.
<i>the gentlemen
from ecocorp are here.</i>
show them in.
gentlemen.
mr. minister.
we'd like to thank you for
reconsidering our proposal...
...on such short notice.
- you make it very hard not to.
well, yes. we do have a reputation
of not taking no for an answer.
here are the contracts.
all in order.
we were told the ships
couldn't be cleared...
...unless you personally
signed off on them.
ships?
i thought there was only one.
oh, well, here's the thing.
in order to make the venture
more profitable...
...we need to process the material
in a volume that makes sense.
how many ships
are we talking about?
plus the one in the port
waiting on clearance, eight.
eight.
this year.
protecting the environment
is a long-term commitment.
you've said so yourself, haven't you?
and i will do again tomorrow
in odessa...
...where i will sign these.
we were really hoping to
settle this today.
i want to review them, now that
there are some addendums.
twenty-four hours
doesn't make a difference...
...on such a long-term
commitment, will it?
no, of course not.
then i will see you tomorrow
in odessa. let's say 9 a.m.
<i>yes.</i>
okay, i'll stay.
- but the material is leaking.
- and?
- we won't be able to hide it.
- i'll take care of it.
if ever they check...
<i>easy. the deal will be closed
very soon.</i>
twenty-four hours. no more.
- yes?
- i've bought you another 24 hours.
you have until tomorrow, 9 a.m.
that should be
more than enough time.
<i>do you have a lead?</i>
better than a lead.
a location.
i'm hungry.
we're 100 kilometers
from beer and sausage.
i don't like sausage.
what would you like?
veal.
roast, with carrots...
...and beets.
in gravy, with madeira in stock.
nothing to start?
a salad.
greens tossed with balsamic.
from modena.
aged?
of course, aged.
and for dessert?
sachertorte.
with whipped cream or without?
with.
to drink?
wine.
tokaj, perhaps?
ice wine.
of course.
- what are you doing?
- seeing a man about some jewelry.
he's gone off the reservation.
send someone to get him back on.
don't kill him.
frank. it's so good to see you,
'mein freund'.
good to see you too, otto.
you didn't mention
you bring company.
it's not really company.
it's...
...complicated.
with you, it's always complicated.
you can tell me about it...
...over a nice schnitzel
with 'kartoffelsalat' i have prepared.
hey, otto, you know
i love your schnitzel...
...but we need to get rid of this first.
binary free-form
magnetic-resolution technology.
english, please, otto.
there's a program the
pentagon has funded...
...through one of their
subsidiary front companies...
...that's been experimenting with
this new kind of weaponry...
...based on the theory
of magnetic attraction.
very hush-hush stuff.
i didn't realize you were in the loop
on the pentagon hush-hush.
you wouldn't believe
what you can discover...
...walking through the internet.
you wanna see the
invasion plans for iran?
maybe some other time.
right now we need to get this thing off
without blowing myself to iran.
i don't wanna bother you
with the details...
...but usually there's
a transmitter plate close by.
you should not be doing this.
first you don't talk,
now you offer advice.
not advice. a warning.
well, a little late for warnings,
don't you think?
i agree with you.
you're off course.
- should i?
- yeah, you should.
look, fellas...
...some things in the car
were a bit off, needed checking.
in my profession,
a man is only as good as the car.
you take care of the car,
the car will take care of you.
the boss says, "back on the road."
frank?
keep at it.
back in the car, frank.
no.
- find it?
- not yet.
you're the smart one?
no. i'm the big one.
not so big anymore, are you?
found it.
- the transmitter.
- can you remove it?
it's wired.
if i do:
you fight good.
but you tie bad.
where are you going?
tired.
that's why i prefer to deal with cars.
that makes two of us.
what do you want me to do
when they...? when they wake up?
probably best to take
the rest of the day off.
i'm not amused.
you'd be less amused
if you ended up dead.
<i>if you wanted me dead, i'd be dead.
you need me.</i>
you want me to complete the job,
i need some clarification.
i'm listening.
in person.
we've already done in person.
<i>well, not to my satisfaction,
apparently.</i>
right now, my satisfaction
should be your main concern.
same place. one hour.
wait for my call.
hello?
you've disappointed me.
you won't be the first
and you won't be the last.
- i told you i wanted to do this in person.
- that won't be necessary. you see...
...since our little chat
at the beginning...
...i've been thinking i don't need
the best for this mundane assignment.
any idiot with
a driver's license will do.
so in the words of the
great american, donald trump:
i'm sorry, but you're fired.
who are you?
- your new chauffeur.
- i want the old one back.
he's about to go to pieces.
you're fired.
how was your nap?
restful. how was your phone call?
brief. fasten your seat belt.
tarconi.
it's me.
i was wondering
when you would call.
i've been busy.
let me guess. in budapest?
you've been busy too.
never a problem keeping that way
with a friend like you.
so i don't have to be redundant,
tell me what you know.
there is a black mercedes
also in budapest.
<i>probably not occupied
by friends of yours.</i>
that is what i know.
now tell me what you know.
i have two bags in the back
and a girl in the front.
russian, i think.
i don't know what she
has to do with anything.
have you tried asking her?
now, why didn't i think of that?
sorry. of course you've asked.
and she says?
i'm going to die.
typical. russians.
they are so dark.
i remember, in school,
reading dostoyevsky and thinking...
...when do these people laugh?
one page after the other...
...misery and suffering
like you wouldn't believe, frank.
inspector, can we save the
literature lesson? i'm blinking here.
is that code?
no, it's some bracelet
they accessorized us with.
wired to explode
if we get too far from the car.
<i>they?</i>
some american.
<i>can you be more specific?
a name? a number?</i>
nothing.
why do you always
make it so easy, frank?
it's my nature.
<i>where are you? i will come there.</i>
that's not a good idea.
they have me on a short leash.
i can't be of much help
if you do not give me something.
how close are you to a computer?
yes, frank?
<i>that wasn't very nice,
back there in the market.</i>
you were the one
who broke the rules, not me.
<i>point well taken.</i>
that makes us even. what say
we start with a clean slate?
so this call is about
kiss-and-make-up, then?
<i>more or less.</i>
you have what i need
to get the bracelet off...
...i have the packages
you need delivered.
here are the new coordinates,
then: 2-6-12.
<i>that'll take you to the place...</i>
<i>...where we can have a
conclusion to this business.</i>
i look forward to it.
frank.
<i>did you get it?</i>
got the signal. give us a little time...
<i>...and we should have his number
and location.</i>
your new phone, sir.
- anything else?
- no.
<i>frank, do you know where
the signal is taking you?</i>
i know restaurant there.
fish like you never had.
roasted with small carrots
and black pepper.
romanian wine, not so good.
but for the last meal,
could be worse.
you really should begin
to think more positive.
i'm realist.
my friend was right when he said
you were doom and gloom.
what means "doom and gloom"?
you know, you only see
the horrible and the terrible.
your friend, where does he get this?
he doesn't know me.
he was talking about you in general.
russians, as a people.
i'm not russian. i'm ukrainian.
excuse me.
not excused. we're different people.
we're different here...
...and here.
me, personally, i think there's
a little bit of an optimist in you.
how you can make such a statement?
you don't know me.
well, i see
you're putting makeup on.
if you were so convinced
we was gonna die, why bother?
what does looking good
have to do with dying?
hello.
what's that?
souvenirs from ibiza.
do you want one?
no, thank you. and neither do you.
we need to stay sharp.
okay.
you stay sharp.
i stay, how you say? optimist?
give me that.
give me that thing. give me the pill!
give me that...
jesus.
great.
- just great.
- come on, frank martin, lighten up.
i should?
how about when those pills hit?
you're gonna be lighting up
like a goddamn christmas tree.
that would be nice.
boring. boring. boring?
oh, yeah.
you should stay in the car.
you want me to pee in car?
okay. go on.
you remember.
don't.
don't.
<i>don't.</i>
oh, no.
- stop, all right?
- why? i don't drive.
i want to have fun.
i want to be happy. you should
try happy instead of so serious.
it's important to stay positive,
like you say, yeah?
- drink with me, frankie.
- i don't want a drink.
now who is all gloomy and doomy?
i say it right? gloomy doomy?
come on, get in the car.
i am free, like a bird.
the girl! come on! faster!
- i have lost my friend!
- i'll buy you a new one.
have any idea
why we have a car on our ass?
i don't know. i don't care.
- you mind?
- first you say i'm doom and gloom...
...and now you tell me do not
be happy? make up your mind.
- yes, frank?
- i thought we had an agreement.
we do.
it had nothing to do
with a car on my ass.
i don't have anything to do with that.
someone else has issues with you?
likely.
what i think is that there are
other forces at work here.
let me check into it,
see what i can find out.
what do i do in the meantime?
drive faster.
what the hell is he doing?
there!
he's down there!
i'm hungry.
should have thought
about a sandwich, not vodka.
look!
i wasn't hungry then, i was thirsty.
why you are so mean to me?
- i'm not being mean. i'm preoccupied.
- what means "preoccupied"?
that means preoccupied.
shoot the tires! come on! get him!
- get down!
- shoot him!
bloody hell!
faster!
stop the car!
oh, shit!
what are you doing?
you're so tense.
you don't say.
i make you relax, okay?
- yeah.
- i'm good at this.
making tense go away.
what are you doing?
i want to feel sex
one more time before i die.
don't you?
what is it with you and dying?
there is something wrong with me?
am i not sexy?
yeah, you're sexy.
you're the gay.
nope, i am not the gay.
i don't mind.
i'm not, okay?
then what's the problem?
did it ever occur to you
that maybe i'm not in the mood?
- i thought rule is don't open package.
- it is.
why you have rules
if you break them?
i keep asking myself the same thing.
phone books.
- you're the package.
- yes.
could have said something.
- would it make a difference?
- yes.
now what are you doing?
you know, back in garage...
...it was very turn-on to me
when you take off your clothes.
i was trying to keep five cretins
from caving my head in.
i don't see the turn-on in that.
you think it's only man
gets turned on by striptease?
i don't like where this
is going, valentina.
would you striptease for me again?
give me the keys. this is not funny.
you want keys?
i want you to stop playing around,
is what i want.
maybe it's last chance to
play around for you and for me.
this is not the time
or the place for playing.
why do i get feeling with you
it's never time or place?
if i wanna get analyzed,
i'll see a psychiatrist.
now, give me the keys.
come on, frank martin.
make playtime for me.
all right? that enough?
not enough.
that is not a striptease, frank.
striptease is sexy.
you know, move your ass a little.
come on, frank martin.
you want keys?
i want strip.
you know what i'm gonna do to you
for making me do this?
spank me?
for starters.
- tie me up?
- you'd like that, wouldn't you?
i like the rough stuff.
really?
oh, but not too rough.
deal was a striptease for the keys.
new deal. kiss me for the keys.
like you mean it.
do you ever kiss
like you mean it, frank?
i'm thinking maybe not.
i'm thinking you live alone.
inside and outside.
thinking it is not dying
you're afraid of.
it's living.
live with me.
just this once.
just this moment. live with me.
- what's his position?
- we lost him.
he headed into the mountains.
we can't get reception up there.
hack into one of the
military satellites.
yes.
you think we're playing games here,
mr. minister?
i don't know what
you're talking about.
i'm talking about a black car full of
your incompetent operatives.
<i>one more move like that and you will
never see your daughter again.</i>
i want to hear her voice.
when the contract
is signed and delivered.
i will not sign until i hear her voice.
you are in no position
to play hardball, mr. minister.
well, neither are you, mr. johnson.
<i>yes, i know who you are.</i>
and i can assure you, if anything
happens to my daughter...
...i will use all the power i have.
i will hunt you down and make you pay
in a most hideous way for this.
we have to move now.
pick up, frank. pick up.
i'm in ibiza. making holiday.
<i>someone hands me
glass of champagne.</i>
<i>i drink.</i>
<i>then i don't feel so good.</i>
<i>i go to bathroom, and next thing,
i'm awake in the car.</i>
i ask him, "where is this?"
he tells me he's just a transporter.
he's pretty good driver.
not like you good.
i tell him, "please.
my father a really powerful man.
big influence. knows a lot of people.
let me call him."
<i>he's afraid.
he's never done this before.</i>
it's supposed to be simple.
pick up, drop off. easy money.
he's been told no calls,
never leave car.
but i convince him.
<i>i call.</i>
<i>but before i say to my father
where we are...</i>
inside the car. come on!
<i>we get away, but...</i>
there's people shooting at us. why?
why they shooting at us?
he says they shoot because
we didn't go according to plan.
i said, "okay, that's the old plan.
what's new plan?"
he says he has a friend.
and then i met you.
and then i feel it's gonna be okay.
you didn't even know me.
of course i don't know you.
i talk about feelings, not knowing.
well, if you was feeling that way, you
sure had a funny way of showing it.
better for a woman
to have a little mystery to her.
no?
no.
yes. just a little.
he's back on the radar, sir.
- yeah.
- where the hell are you?
on the way to bucharest.
not any longer.
new coordinates: 3-7-13.
excuse me, mr. minister.
sorry, just a minute.
inspector tarconi, from marseilles.
well, not exactly marseilles...
...but a small town to the east...
- what do you want, inspector?

this happily ever after?
by tonight, this is all
gonna be a fading memory.
it's gonna be you and me,
laughing over chicken kiev.
liar.
<i>mr. minister, an update, please.</i>
i am ready to sign the contract
once i speak to my daughter.
hello? hello?

i'll call you back.
we are closing the noose, frank.
well, when it closes, make sure
no one tries to drag me out of the car.
you know what this is about yet?
the girl. her father.
large amounts of toxic waste.
it is a trade.
his signature for her life.
i have a reputation
to uphold here, inspector.
one hundred percent
successful delivery rate.
am i detecting a little attachment?
that is not the frank i know. with his
rules, no names, no attachment.
why is everyone so concerned
about my rules?
frank, i always suspected
you are a romantic at heart.
anything else?
<i>where is the rendezvous?</i>
<i>i'll call you back.</i>
- yeah.
- we're almost at the end, frank.
- just give me the coordinates.
- no more coordinates.
the road you're on.
make your first left.
i'd like to know where i'm going.
you'll know when you get there.
don't worry. we got them
right where we want them.
my compliments, frank.
our trust in your abilities
was well deserved.
<i>if you could please
send the girl out.</i>
she's coming.
i'm not coming.
they need you. they won't kill you.
but they will kill you.
do i look like a man who came halfway
across europe to die on a bridge?
do i?
we don't have all day, frank.
look how many of them.
they have all the guns.
how it's gonna be okay?
tell you over dinner.
now, go.
go.
kiss me.
go.
you're gonna get me killed. now, go.
get to her, you bastard.
better now, darling?
finish him.
no! frank!
his beloved car will be his grave.
leaves it, he blows. stays, he drowns.
let's get out of here.
- tarconi.
- they have the girl.
frank, we are trying to track him
through the phone signal.
- where are you?
- in a lake.
a lake?
can you be more specific?
there's a dam.
- a dam?
- i know the place, sir.
- how far?
- ten minutes at least.
frank, we'll be there in 10 minutes.
can you make it any faster?
- we'll do our best.
- thank you.
buy tickets for all of us.
where to?
anywhere this train is going. we need
to keep moving for half an hour.
why don't we just keep
driving around?
another day.
sir! there!
- out. out!
- everybody out!
- come on.
- move!
move, quick!
- mr. minister?
- yes.
someone wants to talk to you.
- papa.
- are you all right?
don't sign.
what you have is 15 minutes.
- you ever find out what this is about?
- garbage.
how much garbage are we talking?
enough to pollute half the country
for a hundred years.
try it again.
for a modern woman,
you are very uninformed.
this is the new world.
there are no more countries.
that's old think.
there are just economic realities.
profit and loss.
efficiency and waste.
think global, not local.
think this.
- yes?
- where are we?
we're almost there.
where?
here. he is on a train.
- and where are we?
- here.
we can get units there.
that's a good idea. do that.
oh, frank, come on.
mr. minister, i assure you,
everything is in order.
i'm sure it is.
- if there are any problems...
- i know you will solve them.
now, if you don't mind...
you might not believe this,
but i am, at heart, a pacifist.
i hate violence.
it creates more problems
than it solves.
you know, i never wanted
to do any of this.
a client asked me to obtain a result...
...so i went about creating
an environment...
...with the least amount
of bloodshed.
no one wanted to cooperate.
not you, not the first driver...
...not your father, not the
recently deceased frank martin.
everyone wanted to fight.
what's so funny?
hearing a dead man talking.
one more step, frank.
come on. one more.
look.
it's over.
two minutes to 9. he signed.
oh, my god.
no, frank. no, no.
it's over, frank. it's over.
mission accomplished.
you and the girl are free to go.
matter of fact,
i'm so impressed by your talent...
...i'd like to offer you a position.
i'd like to offer you one.
permanently disabled.
i hate to waste talent.
but i really don't think
we'd make a very good fit.
that's right.
no!
we wouldn't fit, but you and the
bracelet were made for each other.
no, no.
no!
no!
you're doing the right thing.
valentina.
valentina.
am i in heaven?
looks more like we're in hell.
i don't care.
as long as we're there together.
yes?
mr. minister,
your daughter is in good hands.
thank you.
- what are you doing?
- what you said, the right thing.
and now, if you'll excuse me,
i have a conference to address...
...on the dangers of doing business
with people like you.
thank you very much.
is the launch ready?
- it's on the water, sir, waiting.
- time to leave.
- grab the log.
- okay.
i just don't understand it.
when i was a boy, my father and i...
...used to pull fish out of
this very spot all day long.
times change, inspector.
as do people.
you referring to me?
i don't think that's
a very accurate statement.
i drive the same car,
live in the same house.
oh, i was not referring
to your car or your house.
the sea is so restful.
is lunch ready yet?
mademoiselle, there is
a certain progression to things.
in order to eat the lunch,
you first have to catch the lunch.
and if we keep talking
instead of concentrating...
...we're gonna catch nothing.
i have better idea. why we
don't skip catching of lunch...
...and go right to eating of lunch?
i know wonderful place
just up coast from here...
...where they make fish stew.
incredible.
they use tomatoes and onions,
and little amount of wild lavender.
what kind of wine?
pink. from south.
a châteauneuf, perhaps.
- chilled.
- of course, chilled.
and for dessert?
