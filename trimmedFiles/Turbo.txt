<i>and we're back at the final stretch...</i>
<i>...of the indianapolis 500.</i>
<i>guy gagné is
gaining on the pack.</i>
<i>the young french canadian
is making quite an impression</i>
<i>in his debut
here at the motor speedway.</i>
<i>in all my years of racing,</i>
<i>i've never seen a driver
with this much raw talent.</i>
but what's this?
out of nowhere, a dark horse
is challenging gagné.
he's gaining on the pack.
<i>and
down the front stretch.</i>
moving into fourth position...
third... now, second!
<i>going to the outside
as they cross the bricks!</i>
and it looks like
the winner is turbo!
amazing! unbelievable!
instant replay.
again, in super slo-mo.
vvhoo! hoo!
<i>welcome back, race fans.</i>
<i>we're here with indy's
brightest new star, guy gagné.</i>
<i>tell us, guy, what inspired
you to become a race driver?</i>
you know, dan, everybody's got that
one thing that makes them happy.
and for me, it's terrifying,
terrifying blazing speed.
<i>guy!</i>
- one at a time, please.
- theo!
yes, the handsome
fellow in the back.
what are you doing?
what i've always done. stay
focused, try to run my race.
that's all any driver can do.
next question.
can you please
go to sleep?
we've got work tomorrow.
sleep? are you kidding me?
it takes hours to come down
after a big race like this.
yeah, i bet. okay.
<i>they are the fuel
that keeps me running!</i>
<i>guy, when you were just a rookie
starting out in the indy lights,</i>
<i>did you ever dream that you'd
be standing here today?</i>
<i>well, as my dear father
always told me,</i>
<i>"no dream is too big,
and no dreamer</i>
<i>"too small. "
too small.</i>
sleep!
head in the game. head in the game.
yes! seventeen minutes!
that's a new record!
whoo-hoo! theo!
good morning.
let's go, people!
pick it up!
turbo, ready to make his move.
did you see that?
she cut me off!
ah! the joys of racing.
how could anyone not see the appeal
of watching a bunch of cars,
drive around in circles
for hours on end?
left turn!
left turn! left turn!
your ignorance
saddens me to no end.
left turn!
"what do i do here?
"oh, no, wait a minute.
left turn!"
'morning, chet!
how's it going,
sally?
'morning, chet.
'morning, phil.
well, that's a shame.
and so begins another wonderful
work week at the plant.
all right, people, we got a lot
of tomatoes to harvest today.
we got to pick them, we got to
sort them, we got to eat them.
but most importantly,
we got to be...
safe.
yes! music to my ears.
look at her.
nice curves.
oh! you are one giant,
juicy temptress.
mmm. big red.
any day now.
any day now.
overripe!
overripe!
overripe!
oh, no.
here we go.
bring it on.
whoa! not this time.
and the cars are
at the starting line.
gagné's in
the top pole position,
driving his trademark
number one overripe tomato.
next to him is that feisty
young upstart, turbo.
gentlemen,
start your engines.
gagné rolls into the lead
around the first turn
with turbo hot on his tail
into the straightaway.
hey, there he goes again.
and down the homestretch,
the crowd goes wild!
go, turbo!
they're neck and neck!
gagné, turbo! turbo, gagné!
- and it looks like the winner is...
- turbo!
oh! so close!
it's a photo finish!
overripe!
all right, all right,
knock it off.
talk to your brother, chet.
or i will.
i'm on it, carl.
this will not
happen again.
uh-huh.
heard that before.
okay.
that's lunch!
you do this to yourself,
you know.
i mean, look at you.
how could they
not make fun of you?
it's like you're
almost forcing them.
if you'd just quit
it with the speed stuff...
i can't help it.
it's in me.
mmm, no.
it is not "in" you.
says who?
nature. mother nature.
maybe you've heard of her?
we all have
our limitations, theo.
and the sooner
you accept the dull,
miserable reality
of your existence,
the happier you'll be.
wow. aren't you just a
little ray of sunshine?
heads up! shell
crusher, two o'clock!
all right, people,
you know the drill.
tuck and roll!
can't tuck.
i can't tuck!
theo, tuck and roll!
we've been over this.
i don't tuck and roll.
you have a shell
for a reason. use it.
you use it.
i mean, come on, he's not
even looking this way.
hey, juice box,
nice tricycle!
you see what i'm saying?
all right,
good hustle.
good hustle, everybody!
almost everybody.
quitting time!
good night, jim!
night, sally!
night, steve!
i don't know your name.
i'm out of here! bye!
you're watching fast!

oh!
that tastes awesome.
<i>welcome back to
the road to indianapolis.</i>
<i>i'm here with five-time indy
champ, the legendary guy gagné!</i>
i love you, guy!
<i>tell us, guy, do you have any advice
for the future racers out there</i>
<i>who might be watching
at home right now?</i>
oh, my gosh.
that's me, that's me.
<i>well, there comes a time

<i>fall behind, or push ahead.</i>
push ahead!
<i>to take a chance
and risk it all,</i>
<i>or play it safe

risk it all, guy!
<i>but what really separates the
racers from the champions...</i>
yes!
<i>...that one thing
that separates</i>
<i>the ordinary from
the extraordinary...</i>
what is it?
<i>that one thing is...</i>
no!
no, you didn't!
no! no! no! no! no!
come back to me, tv!
whoa.
only you have your finger on the...
it's working!
'morning, bob.
'morning, sally.
'morning, steve.
'morning...
you know,
this is good.
yes, this is good.
i daresay we've had
a breakthrough, here.
with that tv gone, you can
finally get out of that garage
and put all that racing
nonsense behind you.
and do what?
start living your life.
i have a life?
big red?
big red!
i can't tuck.
i can't tuck!
- yes!
- finally!
all right,
let's chow down!
whoa, whoa, whoa!
hit the brakes, people.
it's gardener day.
you're quitting?
just like that?
hey, nothing ventured,
nothing gained.
that's a bad thing.
"there comes a time
in every race
"when a driver
is forced to make
"that one, key,
split-second decision."
what did he just say?
"take a chance
and risk it all,
"or play it safe
and suffer defeat."
okay, enough
with the crazy talk, theo.
just step away from the
grass and get back to work.
theo!
and the cars are
at the starting line.
gentlemen,
start your engines.
and once again,
it's turbo out front.
no dream is too big.
in the high lane!
at the stripe!
and it looks like
the winner is...
tuck and roll, theo!
tuck and roll!
no!
aw.
are you insane?
you could've
gotten yourself killed!
theo, what were you thinking?
i thought
i could get there.
when are you gonna wake up?
i wish...
i wish i was...
that was close.
oh, no.
yeah!
no, no, no!
come on! faster!
no, no, no!
what happened?
hey, hey, hey!
get out of here!
not dead! not dead!
ugh! it reeks in here.
it's like wearing a hat
made out of feet.
home.
aah! aah!
all right.
i'm okay.
oh.
that's peculiar.
okay, what's happening to me?
on! what? that's me!
oh, come on! stop it!
shh! shh! quiet, quiet!
stop it! stop it! stop it!
welcome, everyone, to this
monthly safety meeting.
well, there goes jerry.
i'm going to hand things
over to chet, now,
who has some important
new policies to go over.
thank you very much, carl.
good afternoon, everyone.
i'm happy to "poli-see"
you all here today.
okay. i would like to begin
with some very exciting news.
the latest figures are in.
accidental smushes
were down 15 percent.
well done, team.
<i>it's tricky to rock a rhyme</i>

and so, in preparation
for crow awareness week,
i'd just like to say...
tuck and roll!
no, i'm not kidding!
tuck and roll!
look out!
granted, yes,
i admit that there's been a wee
bit of damage to inventory, here,
but if you'd just
let me explain...
you're fired!
whoa, okay, carl, if you just
give him one more chance,
i promise that this
will never, ever...
you don't understand.
you're fired.
"you," plural. youse.
y'all. both of you!
chet. i'm so sorry.
you have to believe me,
i didn't mean for this to...
all my life.
all my life, i've defended
you, covered for you,
stood up for you,
apologized for you,
and this is what
i get in return.
dragged down with you
on your sinking ship.
a nice, comfy deck chair
on the s.s. theo!
aye-aye, captain!
i'm really sorry.
what is wrong with you?
i don't know. all i
know is, the other night,
i'm standing above the 101,
and all of a sudden...
it was
a rhetorical question!
chet!
help! the world is moving!
coming through!
okay, i'm gonna
wake up any minute now.
wake up! wake up!
chet?
easy now, fellas. you
really don't wanna do this.
chet!
am i dead?
is this heaven?
i pictured it cleaner.
come on, get up.
theo. whoa.
the crows got you, too.
what? no, chet, it wasn't the crows.
it was...
look at this place.
broken glass, rusty nails.
breathe.
discarded salt packets!
a few, yeah.
it's like a minefield
out here.
oh! oh, no. i've got tetanus.
i've got tetanus.
my jaw is locking up.
chet, will you calm down?
there is no reason to panic.
everything's
gonna be just fine.
<i>well, well, well. buenas noches,
little amigos.</i>
this must be
my lucky day.
<i>hola. it's tito.</i>
hey, tell everyone
i'm bringing it.
what is this place?
well, well, well.
somebody better
call the cops,
because i'm about to
make a killing.
killing?
what'd he drag in
this time?
ha! whiplash is
going to eat them up.
it's gonna
be a slaughter.
mm-hmm, dead meat.
we're gonna die.
we're gonna die.
on! on!
come on, come on.
now, hurry up.
a little far from home
aren't you, garden snail?
hey, i
think we got a crier here.
let's do this!
i got this one!
oh, i got this one!
yeah. yeah, yeah!
come on! this is me!
time to go, theo.
ready...
set...
go!
look. he dead.
taco man
found dead snail.
what?
run!
santa maria!
what did you say
your name was again?
my name is turbo.
aw! i wish i could
rename myself.
where did you find him?
how did he do that?
where did you
come from?
hey, how'd you do that?
theo. a word, please.
okay, that was...
um...
amazing, right?
if you think that's something,
check this out. ooh!
ahhh! turn it off!
sorry. high beams. sorry.
ooh, that's a new one.
it's okay, it's okay, theo.
just hang in there.
as soon as we get home,
we're gonna get you fixed.
what? i don't need to be fixed.
there's nothing
wrong with me, chet.
nothing wrong with you?
well, you're...
you're a freak of nature.
i know, i know!
isn't it great?
theo!
you know what?
i prefer "turbo."
i don't know what crazy
lab you escaped from
but you're amazing,
little amigo. amazing!
tito!
mmm?
um, one second, please.
do you see that sign?
what does it say?
angelo...
it says,
"dos bros tacos."
<i>"dos" bros, tito.
not "lino" bro.</i>
you're supposed to be out
there, selling tacos,
not racing snails.
i know, but this little
guy is something special.
i'm telling you, angelo,
the customers are gonna be
lining up around the block.
i can see it already.
"come for the snail racing, stay
for the chimichangas." huh?
get your head out
of the clouds, tito.
it's enough with
your crazy schemes.
no! you're a taco
genius, angelo.
and it is my mission in life to
share your gift with the world.
great. then first
thing in the morning,
get in that truck
and go sell some tacos.
tito.
you sure you had enough to eat?
are you tired?
here, i made up
your bed.
now, it might get
a little chilly tonight.
so, i warmed up
your blanket.
there you go.
all comfy and cozy.
sweet dreams, little amigo.
i'll see you in the morning.
did he really just
kiss you goodnight?
he did. jealous?
question. what gives
with the super-speed?
hey, hey,
you a robot?
are you
radioactive, homie?
is it contagious?
give the kid
some space.
i'm whiplash. and
this here is my crew.
i'm skidmark!
ah. yeah!
and i'm burn.
sizzle, sizzle, uh-uh.
the name is smoove move. i set
the tone around here, you dig?
now check this.
right about now,
i'm moving so fast, the whole
world's going in slow motion, baby.
whoa...
here one second,
gone the next.
they call me
the white shadow!
because i'm so fast,
all you see is my shadow.
i don't get it.
i'm fast,
like a shadow!
yeah, but shadows,
they're not inherently fast.
white shadow...
i can still see you.
listen, garden snail,
you clearly
got the skills
to pay the bills.
if snails had to
pay bills, that is.
you would be
able to pay them.
yeah, bills.
paid in full, son.
so, i'm here to invite
you to join our crew.
join your crew?
did i say
something humorous?
i'm sorry. it's just that
you guys are, you know,
kind of slow-ish.
oh! really? to our faces?
theo, what are you doing?
now, i'm gonna pretend i didn't
hear what i clearly just heard.
heard what?
i didn't hear anything.
nothing out of order,
did you, theo?
oh, i meant
what i said.
then you better put your
money where your mouth is.
snails don't have money.
otherwise, we'd be able to
pay the bills. remember?
your trash talk is
needlessly complicated.
is it? or is it that your
unpaid bills are overdue?
enough talk.
it's time for action.
it's simple. first one to the
top of that shooting star
wins.
you guys? way up there, huh?
awesome.
let me get my calendar
so i can time you.
oh, you got jokes, rookie?
laugh it up,
garden snail.
on your mark...
get yourself set...
prepare to be
white shadowed!
whoa!
yeah!
whoo!
yeah! barn!
coming through!
oh! those guys
are crazy!
those guys are awesome.
hey, player!
the party up here!
whoo!
how do i
get up there?
later!
on!
coming through!
yeah!
who's "slow-ish" now, garden snail?
today,
everything changes!
tito,
what are you doing?
planning a "taco-volution"!
it's a little concept that i came up with.
when you combine the words...
"taco" and "revolution."
i get it.
but how is that supposed
to help us sell tacos?
patience, bro. taco-volutions
don't happen in a day.
<i>tacos, i say</i>
<i>talking about a taco-volution</i>
<i>sauce and chips
mmm...</i>
<i>and next up
on our tour is the l.a. river.</i>
oh, oh, oh!
<i>famous for its appearance...</i>
get! get out!
sorry, paz. can
you throw that up here?
coming to getcha!
i'm coming to getcha!
bye.
hey!
valley hobby, this is
bobby, how can i help you?
no, you got the wrong number.
yeah, okay.
that's what
i'm talking about!
you want jackson five on your feet?
one jackson per toe.
sure, knock yourself out.
can't get no better.
mmm!
okay. so,
what's your plan, huh?
stay here in this
rundown strip mall?
with a bunch of
lunatic snails,
and a nutso taco man who is
using you to sell mexican food?
because if that's your plan, then
whoopty-skippy-do, sign me up!
my ears are burning. i hope
you're not talking about me.
you two seem to have a special
connection, little amigo,
and snail who seems to be
friends with little amigo.
is this your mother?
your sister?
oh! say no more.
it's your girlfriend.
ah, she's a cutie.
ow!
hmm.
women.
i have to admit,
i was kind of hoping the taco-volution
would've started by now.
it doesn't make sense.
with my brains
and your speed,
we should be destined
for greatness, right?
we need to think big,
little amigo.
i'm talking commercials,
talk shows, county fairs.
flea markets. no, farmers' markets.
no, supermarkets.
we'll cover
all the markets.
quinceañeras,
confirmations, graduations.
the indy 500.
ooh, i got it. we can have
our very own telenovela!
what? no.
oh...
whoo!
this is it, chet. i knew we
ended up here for a reason.
will you just
slow down for a second?
slow down? are you kidding?
i'm never going slow again!
theo, stop. oh!
what are you
trying to say?
i wanna enter him
in the indy 500.
the indy 500?
what are you talking about?
what is he talking about?
now, look, i know it may
sound a little crazy...
no, no, no, tito,
that doesn't sound crazy.
dos bros tacos and sushi.
that was crazy.
what? people love sushi.
dos bros tacos and monkey petting zoo.
that was crazy.
the babies were cute.
the adults were just so mean.
taco man and his sidekick,
the churro.
oh, that was
off-the-hook crazy!
crazy awesome.
but this, tito? this is in
a category all by itself.
angelo, please.
come on, chet.
just hear me out.
theo, a snail cannot race in a
competition meant for cars.
there are rules.
actually, i've been doing
a lot of research,
and there's
nothing in the rules
that says a snail
can't enter the race.
there's nothing that says this
sponge can't enter the race either,
but that doesn't mean
it's ever gonna happen.
millions of people watch that race.
uh-huh.
this could put us
on the map, bro.
trying to work, here.
oh, come on, angelo.
all we have to do is raise the
$20,000 registration fee.
what?
i figured, once we sell the truck...
sell the...
are you even listening
to yourself, tito?
you want to invest our entire
life savings in a snail!
i'm telling you, this snail crawled
into our lives for a reason.
i think he could be
our little shooting star.
did you hear that, chet?
this guy believes in me.
that guy is as
crazy as you are.
they'll never let
you into that race.
and even if they did,
you wouldn't survive one lap.
yeah, but...
angelo, listen...
tito!
theo!
not every dream is
meant to come true.
yeah, what he said.
a snail in
the indy 500.
what will you
think of next?
don't worry, little amigo.
we'll get that entrance fee somehow.
hmm.
now, i know
some people may say
$20,000 sounds
like a lot of money.
it is
a lot of money.
and i know some people
may say i'm crazy.
but i say, when a snail crawls into
your life at 200 miles an hour,
then you'd have to be crazy
not to grab onto that shell,
and take a ride
of a lifetime.
now, in case you're
still not convinced...
boom! check out my well-designed
endorsement poster.
<i>...are the
champions, my friends...</i>
what's your point, tito?
my point is, we got a chance to
change our lives for the better.
to make starlight plaza the great
place we all know it could be.
now, come on.
who's ready to sponsor
the next indy 500 champion?
sorry, tito, but
i've got work to do.
no, you don't.
none of you do.
i don't get it.
that poster was awesome.
oh, well, good try, you did your best.
time to go home, theo.
oh, we're going
to indianapolis, chet.
don't you worry your chubby
little face about that.
all right, team.
snail up!
<i>and next up
on our tour is the l.a. river.</i>
famous for its appearance
in such movies as...
you've just been
white shadowed!
oh!
whoo!
next stop is
the starlight plaza.
yes!
burn. let's get
this party started.
you know it.
snailed it.
skidmark. you bringing
the beverages?
oh, i got a beverage for you.
and a beverage for you.
light her up, turbo.
do your thing, baby.
hey, angelo!
we got customers.
whoa!
okay, you ready?
go!
huh?
all right.
you're good to go.
okay, everybody.
back on the bus.
oh, mama,
you look good!
bye. come again. i do
weddings, bar mitzvahs.
thank you.
come back soon.
tomorrow, later on today.
i'll be here.
good luck with
that snail of yours.
thank you, my friend.
i gotta hand it
to you, tito.
for once, one of your
crazy schemes worked.
i know!
and, hey, if we did better
because of that billboard,
just imagine what
the indy 500 could do.
hey, don't go
crazy on me.
we had a good day.
we sold a few extra tacos.
it's good enough.
you better not mess this up, tito.
mmm-hmm.
oh, no.
oh, yes. we're going to
indianapolis, chet!
"i" to the "n" to the "dizzy"
to the "wizzah." you dig?
yes, sir.
one breakfast burrito, please.
that's it. i'm sorry, honey.
today is the day.
tito!
are you ready,
big man?
on three. one, two...
indy, baby!
oh, oh!
i got it! "fasty"!
are you kidding me?
huh?
oh!
"turbo"!
all right, as the kids say,
"time to plump your ride."
oh, heck, no!
let's do this.
now, that's
more like it.
no twitching. voila'!
ooh-wee!
suited and booted, gooted and
looted, dipped and whipped!
we've got
a contender, baby!
oh, look at him go!
ah.
fresh air, baby.
we ain't in
van nuys no more.
uh-uh.
hi, chet.
you're gonna be
my boyfriend!
i'm gonna
call you "boo."
"boo"? what does
that even mean?
sure beats the view
from the garden, huh?
i can't believe
you're doing this.
"we." we are doing this.
you. i'm just a hostage.
theo, what happens
if you wake up tomorrow,
and your powers
are gone, hmm?
what then?
then i better make
the most of today.
this is even bigger
than hobby-con.
wow. now,
that's a car.
whoa. shiny.
gagné.
whoa!
and guy gagné
wins the pole,
with a four-lap average
of 230 miles per hour.
that's gagné's
best time yet.
turbo has never
gone that fast.
i mean, yet.
so, you got
a plan, taco man?
of course i do.
please tell me those phony
glasses are not your plan.
uh, no.
that would be ridiculous.
come on, phony
glasses, do your thing.
oh, this great. i'm gonna
go have heart attack.
<i>qué pasa, my friend?</i>
i have a driver that i'd
like to enter into the race.
what team does
your driver race for?
dos bros tacos
and company.
has he passed
the rookie test?
hey, come here. let's
cut to the chase, okay?
you have glasses,
i have glasses.
what do we gotta do
to get this done, bro?
hey, let go.
come on, man, let go!
this is no way to treat a guy with glasses.
i have astigmatism and stuff.
yeah, yeah.
guy, how do you do it,
shattering your own
records year after year?
well, when a cheetah
chases after a gazelle,
does he ever stop to think, "maybe
i've caught enough gazelles.
"maybe i should just settle
down, try the vegan thing."

indy 500 champion!

welcome, given the situation.

white shadow!
<i>bonzai!</i>

i'm talking about!
<i>whoa!
that snail is fast!</i>
oh, man, wait until
people see this!
<i>whoa! that snail is fast!
what? are you seeing this?</i>
- hello?
- have you heard?
yes, i've heard.
<i>that snail is fast.</i>
forget about it. this
will blow over by noon.
<i>whoa!
that snail is fast!</i>
<i>- hello?
- have you seen it?</i>
yes, i've seen it!
<i>whoa!
that snail is fast!</i>
<i>what?</i>
<i>snail is fast!</i>
<i>you see
the snail moving fast</i>
<i>you slow,
you gonna get passed</i>
<i>you see him
gaining position for first</i>
<i>he won't be last</i>
<i>he's ready to make a dash</i>
<i>snail quicker
than a lightning flash</i>
<i>his engine's roaring,
he's flooring</i>
<i>he won't run out of gas</i>
<i>whoa!
that snail is fast!</i>
<i>that snail is fast,
fast, fast, fast, fast</i>
whoa! are you
seeing this?
whoa!
<i>you cannot have
a snail in the indy 500.</i>
<i>whoa!
it's a miracle of nature!</i>
<i>will the snail
be crushed by the giant race cars?</i>
whoa!
<i>that snail is fast,
fast, fast fast, fast, fast, fast</i>
whoa. that snail is fast.
we've just received
word that the ceo
of indy car is about
to make a statement.
and so, after careful
consideration and...
<i>that
snail is fast that snail is fast</i>
sorry. my bad.
i've decided...
please, say yes.
please, say yes.
please, say no.
please, say no.
white shadow.
i've decided that i simply cannot
permit a snail to enter...
please, sir,
give my snail a shot,
and i swear,
you won't regret it.
mr. lopez, while i appreciate your
enthusiasm, my decision is...
let him race!
let him race!
let him race!
let him race! let him race!
let him race!
now, now. order.
sir, if i may.
you might want to
get a two-shot here.
i, like this passionate gentleman
here, came from humble beginnings.
in the words of
my dear father,
"no dream is too big,
and no dreamer, too small."
and that is why
i, for one,
believe that if the indy 500 isn't
going to put a limit on speed,
then it shouldn't
put a limit on spirit!
give the people
what they want.
let him race!
let him race! let him race!
let him race!
just me.
whole frame, my face.
all right!
"all right," what?
your snail can compete
in the indianapolis 500.
yeah!
has the world
lost its mind?
to turbo!
starlight plaza! hey!
he ain't slow no more.
that's for sure.
shut the door.
get on the floor.
barbeque sauce!
<i>and we're back
with more from indianapolis.</i>
check it out.
we're on tv.
<i>mr. lopez,
how do you feel about</i>
<i>getting to compete
in the indy 500?</i>
<i>i'm just so happy.</i>
<i>and we'd all be
happy to see you</i>
<i>come on down to
the starlight plaza.</i>
<i>just north of the 101
in van nuys, california.</i>
<i>kim ly nail salon. where we
put the "nail" in "snail. "</i>
taco man cried in front of
millions of people. ow!
here you go, paz.
nice and warm.
goodnight, tito.
you comfy enough, bobby?
uh... no.
okay, let me know
if you need anything.
hey! no touching!
smooth,
smooth, smooth.
sleep tight, little amigo.
we got a big day tomorrow.
yep.
big day, indeed.
hmm, i'm detecting a refreshing
note of disapproval.
i'm worried.
and you should be, too.
i'll be fine.
you are delusional,
you know that?
it's big red
all over again.
only this time, instead
of one lawn mower,
it'll be 32 giant,
fire-breathing cars!
and i won't be
able to save you.
you won't have to, because
this time, i have speed.
you're not a car.
you're a snail.
i got a shot here, chet.
i can do this. you'll see.
no, i won't.
i will not stand by and watch
the only brother i've got
risk his life chasing
some impossible dream.
i'm sorry, theo.
all of these people,
they believe in me.
guy gagné
believes in me.
why won't you?
and by the way,
my name is turbo.
<i>all right.
tout suite, let's go.</i>
whoa.
quad-overhead cam.
fastest open-wheel, single-seat
machine on the planet.
i think i'm in love.
no way.
you're not trying to steal
my trophy from me, are you?
because if you want one for yourself,
you may have a long wait.
espresso?
so, you are my
little competition, eh?
the underdog
versus the champion.
the world loves the
underdogs, you know.
the dreamers out there,
they need them.
need to believe
that one day, maybe
they could achieve
the impossible, too.
well, the sad truth is,
underdogs seldom win.
and dreamers?
let's just say, eventually,
they have to wake up.
i've never talked to a snail before.
so small, so amusing.
no wonder they want
to see you race, eh?
vroom! vroom!
look at him go.
thank you, plucky snail.
because of you, the whole world
will be watching this race.
and when the checkered flag drops,
they'll be watching me win.
crawl home, garden snail,
while you still can.
<i>good

<i>good afternoon
and welcome</i>
<i>to what has become the most
anticipated and unprecedented</i>
<i>running of
the indianapolis 500.</i>
<i>so, without further ado,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,
and snail,</i>
<i>start your engines!</i>
it's like an earthquake!
i love it. is it weird
that i love it?
everyone,
off the track, please.
see you in the winner's
circle, garden snail.
easy to the peasy, baby.
everything's gonna be fine, okay?
we can do this, right?
oh, i wish i was tiny,
so i can give you a hug.
get off the track!
okay, okay, i'm going!
good luck out there, turbo!
did anybody
bring earplugs?
what?
oh, i can't watch this.
the pace car is off and the
parade laps are underway.
<i>only moments until
the green flag drops,</i>
<i>and history is made
here at indianapolis.</i>
let's do this.
<i>and the race is on!</i>
you go, turbo!
<i>turbo,
struggling out there.</i>
looks like the party is over
for the motoring mollusk.
he's getting killed
out there.
what have we done?
whoa.
that snail is history.
oh! i think
i'm gonna be sick.
come on, garden snail.
get your head in the game!
go, go, go!
all right, go, go, go!
come on! we're supposed
to be a team, here!
we're trying.
it's a snail. there's
not that much to do.
that's it. this pit crew is
officially under new management.
now, this is how it's done.
air jack.
jack-tivate.
lube.
applied liberally.
detailing.
wax on, wax off.
ow!
fuel!
down the hatch.
chug!chug!chug!
foot massage.
you know it.
relaxing vibes.
own it, brother.
now, de-lax those vibes!
ahhh! are you crazy?
ow! yeah, i'm crazy! what
made you think i was sane?
i don't
know how to... ow!
are you a car?
no.
are you a car?
no!
then stop
driving like one!
now get out there.
snail up, baby!
go, t-boogie, go!
gagné with
a commanding lead now.
followed by claudio cruz,
shelby stone and takao noguchi.
go!
come on.
snail up.
snail up.
yes!
i don't believe it!
turbo just went under a car!
whoa!
did you see that?
<i>despite a rocky start, it
looks like turbo is gaining some ground.</i>
yeah! now we're talking!
where is he?
where is he?
oh! he passed another one!
<i>yeah!</i>
that's my brother, right there.
that's the back of his head!
go, go, go!
left turn! left turn!
yeah! left turn!
<i>turbo maneuvers past
shelby stone and into second place!</i>
he is hot
on gagné's heels!
the snail's not
going away, guy.
all right,
i know, i know!
<i>these racers better
watch it coming into turn four.</i>
this late in the race, that
outside edge is full of marbles.
and you don't want to play
with these marbles, kids.
that rubber
peeling off the tires
can be a minefield
for these drivers.
here we go.
whoa!
turbo!
oh, no.
oh, man.
what are we gonna do? if he takes
another hit like that last one...
you gotta
pull him, tito.
i'm sorry, little amigo.
it's over.
hey.
we got this far.
it's good enough.
no, it's not.
<i>with the green
flag about to be waved,</i>
<i>it looks like a mere
formality at this point.</i>
<i>gagné, just five laps
away from victory.</i>
wait a minute! turbo is
still in this thing!
huh?
what?
whoa!
what happened there?
come on, come on!
whoa!
no!
theo!
no!
- not this time.
- come on!
come on, turbo.
come on, turbo.
come on, just hold in
there a little longer.
no!
no!
farewell, little snail.
<i>unbelievable!
turbo takes the lead.</i>
snail-style, baby!
bad idea. bad idea.
and the white flag is in the air as
we enter the 200th and final lap.
<i>turbo weaving between
lapped cars like a snail possessed.</i>
<i>he is determined to
hold onto his lead.</i>
no!
i will not
lose to a snail!
gagné is
in the marbles!
guy, what are you doing?
oh!
ah...
theo!
turbo!
<i>the track is backed up
all the way down the front straight.</i>
<i>it's complete
gridlock down there.</i>
i can't see him.
i can't see him.
guy, are you okay?
where am i?
there he is.
theo.
let's finish this.
oh, no.
oh...
turbo.
no, no, no. theo, what are you doing?
don't give up.
oh!
oh!
hey! where are you going?
no, no!
get back here! no, wait!
no! little snail!
theo!

now, i'm gonna pretend i didn't
hear what i clearly just heard.
ugh!
salt!
crows?
are you kidding me?
long time no see, chet!
hey!
don't test me, crow.
white shadow!
nice moves
back there, boo.
is this
really necessary?
no, man.
but it's fun.
whoo!
theo!
theo!
chet?
finish this!
i can't.
oh, yes, you can.
you're right, you know.
it is in you.
it's always been in you.
now, i did not just face every
fear known to snail-kind
to come down here and watch
you hide in your shell.
i'm sitting on a crow,
for crying out loud!
don't even
think about it.
and my little brother
never gives up.
that's the best
thing about you.
so, you get out there
and you win this...
turbo.
he's still going.
son of a gun.
come on, come on!
unbelievable!
the race is back on!
- excuse me.
- excuse me.
little amigo!
hey, snail! he's gradually
gaining on you!
come on! come on!
turbo! tuck and roll!
and turbo wins it
by a shell!
that's what
i'm talking about!
chet! chet!
turbo!
chet!
we won, right?
we just won?

hey, everybody! my brother
won the indy 5,000!
wow. that's so romantic.
<i>hey, angelo. we did it!</i>

hey, gagné! why don't you pick
on someone your own size?
you big bad boy!
security!
i step on you!
do you like that?
sleeper hold!
all right.
let go of me!
i'm just an old lady!
kim ly nail salon!
that's our snail!
it's like i always said,
little amigo, you are amazing!
okay, wait.
