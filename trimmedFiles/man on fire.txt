<i>- sí. bueno.
- family is everything.</i>
<i>no?</i>
<i>now, do you love your son?</i>
sí.
<i>now... do you understand?</i>
<i>you have a $10 million insurance policy.
i know that.</i>
georgina!
obey me, i will love you.
come on.
that's how it works, huh?
<i>- simple.
- that's right.</i>
mwah.
she got a sister?
how's business?
the japanese are here in a big way.
cheap labor, factory space.
but they feel a lot safer living
over the border in el paso.
i ferry them back and forth.
they think i'm john wayne.
- ah.
- come on.
- i live like a king down here.
- yes, you do.
- you been workin'?
- yeah. no.
nah. been movin' around,
you know.
colombia, couple of places i can't name.
nothing catches my fancy.
oh.
you think god will forgive us
for what we've done?
- no.
- you don't?
me either.
- how long you staying?
- i don't know. i just... you know.
i wanted to see you, ray,
see how you're doin'.
you know, i came by on impulse.
well, i could do with some impulse.
what happened?
family paid the ransom...
then they sent the kid home
after a couple of days...
minus an ear, of course.
now every mother in mexico city
with a little bit of money wants
bigger and better bodyguards...
my own wife included.
i hate to break it to you,
but she's right. she's right.
look, sammy, all my clients have, uh,
kidnap and ransom insurance.
i have a policy. a.i.g.
my dad gave it to me.
yeah, i know.
i got it for your dad.
<i>but what are you gonna do in 60 days
when you can't renew it?</i>
- you can't because
you don't have a bodyguard.
- i had to let emilio go.
you gotta please lisa.
i mean, hey, ass like that's hard to find.
look, a bodyguard's
like anything else.
you get what you pay for, okay?
you could do this.
you get one that's got a decent résumé.
we're not looking for
goddamn superman here, right?
get someone cheap
till you renew the policy...
and then, uh...
then fire the prick for whatever.
incompetence.
all kidding aside, the most important thing
is that your daughter goes back to school...
and that your wife gets to save face.
this way, you won't be the only
unprotected family in the neighborhood.
<i>that's right. a bodyguard.
your spanish is good enough.</i>
- you're crazy.
- you even look the part.
in my state,
i couldn't guard a corpse.
<i>it's rich guys flashing their cash.
it's all for show.</i>
<i>- nothing's gonna happen.
- yeah? you think they'd hire
a drunk, a has-been?</i>
you have to keep it under control.
what if there was, you know, say,
a kidnapping attempt? what do i do then?
<i>you do your best. they're not gonna be
paying you enough to perform miracles.</i>
<i>- i don't know.
- it's not exactly a scam, crease.</i>
- even at half speed, you're pretty damn good.
- yeah.
bodyguard's gotta be close
to people though.
he gotta talk all the time,
and i'm no good at that.
you'll be the silent type.
people are gonna appreciate that.
bodyguard. so who's the guy?
samuel ramos. he's a young guy.
<i>he owns one of the plants in juárez.</i>
<i>yeah?</i>
the jap car industry is in the toilet.
he's trying to persuade ford
to partner with him.
i think he's in trouble.
his family lives in mexico city.
he asked me if i knew
anybody he could trust.
- and you thought of me.
- yeah.
take a job, crease.
breathe some air.
<i>then decide if you want
to stick around or not.</i>
<i>besides, i'm glad to see you.
i got nobody to talk to down here.</i>
listen, my wife wants someone
presentable and polite.
you'll be the fifth candidate
she sees this week.
your résumé's quite impressive.
<i>sixteen years of military experience,
extensive counterterrorism work.</i>
i'm surprised anybody could afford you.
what's the catch?
i drink.
how does that affect you?
well...
coordination, reaction time.
if top professionals try to kidnap
your daughter, i'll do the best i can...
but the service will be
on par with the pay.
what if amateurs tried?
i'd probably kill 'em.
is that likely?
no.
no one is to know about your drinking.
that includes my wife.
<i>lisa!</i>
lisa!
my wife, lisa.
and this is john creasy.
- you're an american.
- so are you.
it's all in there.
would you like a drink?
yes, uh, jack and water'd be good.
<i>- have you done much
of this kind of work before?
- no, ma'am.</i>
but he has a lot of experience
in related fields.
- you have a family, mr. creasy?
- no.
pita.
<i>pita.</i>
<i>- thank you.
- yes, mom?</i>
honey, this is, uh, mr. creasy.
in english, honey.
um, do you wanna show
mr. creasy to his room?
- this way, mr. creasy.
- okay.
thank you.
just like that?
i think it's nice...
that he's an american.
i think it's terrific. you sure?
thank you.
thank you.
i feel better now.
<i>- ¡hola, bruno!
- ¡buenas tardes!</i>
that's bruno, the gardener.
and, um, that's maria, the cook.
<i>- ¡hola, maria!
- hola, pita.</i>
we fixed the room up two weeks ago.
it's nicer than before.
<i>you've got a tv and c.d. player.
what kind of music do you like, mr. creasy?</i>
i don't know.
- you don't know?
- i don't know.
that's bird.
emilio forgot to take him
when he left.
emilio was my last bodyguard.
have you protected a lot of children
before, mr. creasy?
creasy. you can call me creasy.
and no, you're the first.
creasy.
bye, creasy.
so long.
bye, bird.
ow.
- school tomorrow, peeps.
- does that mean we can get a dog?
<i>dad promised me one
when i went back to school.</i>
yeah, we'll see.
if you get a dog,
will you give up your bear?
you're getting too old for him.
<i>- how'd you like mr. creasy?
- creasy.</i>
he said to call him just creasy.
- uh-huh.
- that isn't disrespectful, is it?
no, not if he asked you.
here. there you go.
- he's like a bear too.
- yeah?
a big, sad bear.
- is he sad?
- i think. or something.
- good night, honey.
- night.
- oh, can you get me
some floss in the morning?
- floss?
- yeah, the strawberry kind.
- oh, sure.
good night, bear.
creasy bear.
what's that one for?
<i>la virgin de guadalupe.</i>
business. for toyota, for ford.
if one dies, maybe she can
resurrect the other one.
i don't know.
she likes him.
- what are you talking about?
- creasy.
pita likes him.
pita loves school.
<i>pita would love count dracula
if he took her back there, honey.</i>
okay?
<i>- hey. are you okay?
- i don't know.</i>
okay?
i don't know, lisa.
i'm trying.
come on, bird.
that's right.
that's right. come on.
all right. home to emilio.
you're home free, baby.
- where are you from, creasy?
- the u.s.
<i>- i know, but which state?
- no state in particular.</i>
you can drive and talk
at the same time.
no, i can't, pita, so, please,
let me just do my job.
are you going to stay?
my last bodyguard left.
somebody gave him
more money than we could.
i guess that makes me
a bargain then, huh?
being black... is that a positive or negative
for a bodyguard in mexico?
time will tell.
there were 24 kidnappings
in mexico city in the last six days.
- four a day.
- yeah?
- twenty-four?
- twenty-four. what do you
think about that, creasy?
- i think that you know
entirely more than you should.
- well, thank you.
<i>hola, miguel.</i>
- see you later.
- you have to sign.
- what?
- you have to sign in, show them your i.d.
<i>buenos días. come on.</i>
right there.
<i>- hola, manuel.
- hola, pita.</i>
<i>- ¡hola, pita!
- ¡hola!</i>
pita! it's so good to have you back.
sister anna, this is
my new bodyguard, creasy.
sister anna, the headmistress.
<i>señor creasy.</i>
hurry. class is about to begin.
- go, go.
- bye, creasy.
<i>- madre.
- you must look after our pita.</i>
it is not good that she's late today.
i'm very sorry. i, uh... i'll have to get
used to the rules. it won't happen again.
no offense, but i regret
that your profession needs to exist.
<i>so do i, madre. so do i.</i>
do you ever see the hand of god
in what you do?
no, not for a long time.
the bible says,
"be not overcome of evil, but overcome..."
"overcome evil with good."
<i>i'm the sheep that got lost, madre.</i>
when you were a kid, creasy,
did you like school?
- i don't remember.
- you don't remember?
no, i don't remember.
it, uh... nah, i didn't like it.
why not?
because it wasn't a school like yours.
there was no, uh... no sister anna.
were you unhappy?
being unhappy, pita, that's a state of mind.
i really don't remember.
what happened to your hand?
- it's a birth defect.
- no, it's not.
look, no more questions, okay?
- it really wasn't a question.
- it sounded like a question.
<i>look, i got a job to do. hey!</i>
<i>no. gracias. gracias. no. no.</i>
listen to me.
i'm being paid to protect you, okay?
no, no, no. i'm being paid
to be your bodyguard.
<i>look at me.
i'm not being paid to be your friend.</i>
<i>i'm being paid to protect you,
so no more questions. that's it. period.</i>
<i>- you hear me?
- yes.</i>
- and no crying.
- i'm not crying.
well, don't start.
you gotta understand, this is a job.
in order for me to do...
in order for... wait a minute.
yeah, come in.
mr. creasy.
i just wanted to make sure
you have everything you need.
i'm fine, thanks.
is the food all right?
'cause, uh, maria told me you didn't eat.
uh... yeah, the food is great.
i just wasn't that hungry tonight.
so you, uh, read the bible?
yeah, sometimes.
- does it help?
- yeah, sometimes.
- can i talk to you for a minute?
- sure.
how are you doing with pita?
fine. fine.
soon as she figures out that i'm
not her new toy, we'll be fine.
- yeah, she told me about that.
- okay.
- you don't have children, do you?
- i told you i didn't.
well, they can be tenacious
when they want something.
<i>- and pita just wants to be friends.
- okay.</i>
but you're paying me to protect her,
right? not to be her friend.
right?
so, uh...
look, maybe this isn't
gonna work out.
maybe your husband should find
somebody who's a little more sociable.
no, you're right.
you're being paid to protect her...
and i'm confident that you'll do that.
i'll be coming with you tomorrow.
i hope that's all right.
<i> you think god
will forgive us for what we've done?</i>
<i>i'm tired of killin', ray.</i>
<i>you think god will forgive us
for what we've done?</i>
<i>in my state, i couldn't...
i couldn't guard a corpse.</i>
<i>talk all the time.</i>
<i>you know, i'm no good at that.</i>
<i>you know, i'm no good at that.</i>
<i>you know how they say...</i>
<i>a bullet always tells the truth?</i>
yeah.
- hey.
- crease.
what's wrong?
hey, listen, you-you ever have a...
a nine-millimeter round
that didn't go off?
well, yeah. failure to fire.
i know.
failure to fire and-and-and, uh...
you know, i pulled the trigger
and... and... and...
click, nothing.
you're talking about a bad primer.
yeah, i... yeah. yeah, yeah.
but i... you know, right, dimple.
dimple on the primer.
that may be.
well, like we used to say...
a bullet always tells the truth.
crease?
- you all right?
- yeah.
what were you shooting at?
yeah, i'm sorry, ray.
i'm sorry i woke you.
no, i-it's okay. nothin'.
i was watchin' tv.
okay.
all right.
pita, you have a pencil?
thank you.
it's hard to get used to
the traffic down here.
yeah. i'm very sorry.
- see you, baby.
- all right. see you later.
- hey. don't forget your towel.
- oh, thank you.
<i>bye. buenas días.</i>
- you're a strong swimmer.
- i never win.
thanks.
<i>- so what do i do?
- what do you think you should do?</i>
you're the fastest one in the water,
the slowest one off the blocks.
- what do you think that means?
what do you gotta do?
- get faster off the blocks.
get faster off the blocks.
- our big swim meet is in three weeks.
- yeah?
<i>- i was gonna enter the 150 freestyle.
- yeah, you'll be fine.</i>
you'll be okay.
- i'll still be slow.
- you're not slow.
i never finish better than third.
all right.
maybe you are slow then.
<i>go! ¡vamos!</i>
<i>¡vamos, bird!</i>
¡vamos!
<i>how do you think he got out?</i>
- i let him go.
- it's better to be free, right?
it's better for him.
<i>actually, he was driving me crazy.</i>
good night.
good night.
- see you in a couple of days. i love you.
- all right. love you.
be good. come on, lise.
- all right, sweetheart.
we'll call you from detroit.
- okay.

- love you.
<i>- okay. bye, honey.

<i>- bye.
- oh. gracias.</i>
<i>- okay. bye, honey!
- bye.</i>
- i love you.

that sets you free.
you are a prisoner on this block
until that sound sets you free.
- are you ready? are you ready?
- yes. yes.
- are you set?
- uh-huh.
- creasy?
- hmm?
- what's a concubine?
- why do you ask?
it's in my history book.
- oh.
- it's like a wife, right?
yeah. yes, uh... can i see that?
- kind of a wife.
- right there.
but the emperor of china
had 1,000 of them.
um...
okay, like nowadays in-in the west,
they have one husband for one wife.
but in the olden time cultures,
they had, uh...
you know, different...
uh, different rules.
- why, you feel sorry for the husband?
- yeah.
can you imagine my mom
multiplied by a thousand?
creasy. you're smiling.
- what?
- you were smiling.
- no, i'm not. no, i was not.
- you were.
- you're not now, but you were.
- you were smiling. i wasn't.
- you were.
- when?
- like five seconds ago.
- i'm not smiling.
- a second ago you were.
- you said five seconds ago. now that's six.

ten seconds ago i was smiling. okay, in
the next 10 seconds, let's see who smiles first.
- you smiled already. see? you did.
- mmm!
- no, that wasn't a... that was a smirk.

"i'm in love! i'm in love!
<i>and i'm moving to mexico. "</i>
<i>and... i said...</i>

don't be a crybaby.
you're tougher than that.
<i>sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.</i>
- remember the day you wanted the pencil?

<i>during your daughter's abduction.</i>
<i>i have a written order

authorizing our participation
ex-officio.
if you want to speak to

the kidnapper will tell you

<i>por favor, don't do that...</i>
or you will find yourself
in a real mexican hell.
no mariachi.
no tequila... and no pita.
<i>crease.</i>

<i> when i heard it was

- it's, uh...
it's been two days.
they're negotiating a ransom.
these things take time, mr. creasy.
crease.
don't fuck with me, all right?
do you have the 10 million?
do you have the money?
- yes, we have the money.
- now if you do as i say...
the girl will be returned

<i>but if you deviate from
the process in any way...</i>
i swear,
you will never see her again.
<i>i understand. listen, i-i too worship

i ask you if you understand.
hello, sir.
this is, uh, mr. ramos's attorney.
<i>he's going through a very difficult

<i>okay, the money, 10 million,

<i>no. why?</i>
he's got a bad ticker.
he's got a heart condition.
look, he's a nervous kid
who doesn't respond well to stress.
all right.
but the car will not be powerful.
remove the trunk lid.
use the maid's valiant acapulco.
<i>you will arrive at

you will drive around
the circle two times.
<i>samuel will remove his shirt

<i>the phone will ring.
he will answer and wait for instructions.</i>
<i>there is a map on the top of the phone.

<i>perfecto.</i>
- what are you doing? he said no phones!
- relax. relax.
- i'm just trying to protect your daughter.
- just get me there, please.
- what's going on?
- hospitals can be very dangerous places.
