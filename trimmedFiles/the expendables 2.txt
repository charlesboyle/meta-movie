hello, my dear!
sure i think about you.
what else to think about?
are you without hope.
have you served in the military, right?
i figured it out.
yes, ma'am. for three years.
last time i was in afghanistan.
- and do not you also love the army?
- it's a long story.
he'd like to hear it.
all right.
i was trained to be
and sniper instructor,
but i wanted to mix them,
to have part of the action.
once i stayed block
in a valley infection.
went out about 30 taliban
houses on hills.
we încolþiserã good on eight of us.
i called for help,
but the captain never wanted to hear.
he did not want to put them natives in danger.
so do we scattered.
some were dragged through the anþuri, some went
the riverbeds and the rest fled.
but everything in the attack was.
we stayed there for about three hours.
until, finally, came
a helicopter to get us out of there.
i drove the taliban...
when he went dust, i saw
that four of my team
were dead in ditch,
and two lay on the river bed.
i was angry and disgusted.
all died in vain.
and most miserable thing of all
is that when i returned to base,
i learned that my cashier shot
stray dog? ?that we adopted.
the commander gave the order to eliminate
all animals in the base.
i had come atâþia dead for a day.
was time to move on.
i heard that this gang looking people
and here i am.
- find out location?
- yes. apparently it's 15 km n-v.
all right.

five tonnes of plutonium-based weapons.
mine was abandoned after the cold war.
no one knows it's there.
