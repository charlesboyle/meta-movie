- what are you gonna cook?
- your favorite.
what, again?
- well, this is the last one.
- what, you mean no more tomatoes?
you can never have
enough tins of tomatoes, eh?
instead...
we've got five tins of chickpeas.
that should last at least five year, eh?
- fancy a glass of wine?
- yeah, that'd be great.
we're in luck.
drinkable.
- you all right, sweetheart?
- yeah, i'm fine.
well, i'm not fine, it's all fucked, but...
- our children are safe, aren't they?
- totally. yeah.
thank god we paid for that school trip.
imagine if we hadn't!
i can't. i can't imagine. i can't imagine.
and i don't want to imagine. i don't...
listen, they're far, far away.
and they're safe and sound.
ok?
- yeah.
- yeah.
ok.
don't worry...
gorgeous.

i'd forgotten all about it.
i thought we could have them after dinner.

he'll want something to eat.

since your boyfriend ran out on us.
if he's still breathing,
he won't be interested in pasta.
jacob!
- it'll be your fucking neck!
- don't say that!
- out of order, jacob.
- why?
we all know it's true.
the sooner she faces it, the better.
there are no survivors.
it's just us in here and them out there.
- sam?
- quiet!
- god, it's a boy.
- wait, wait. you don't know who's out there.

sandford's upriver a few miles.
- how did you get here?
- they were chasing me. screaming.
i was scared. i ran.
i tried other houses.
they were empty.
i came through the woods
and i followed the river until i got here.
- who were chasing you?
- my mum.
my dad.
they're trying to kill me.
- there's others, too.

welcome to london.
hey, doyle, you having fun down there?
you can kiss my ass.
this is the worst combat i ever saw.
where's the combat?
i hear you.
- give me something to shoot.
- too easy.
north-east of med centre,
- fat guy jerking off in the toilet.
- oh, bug-nuts. him again.
i don't see him.
where is fester fucknut?
his dick in his hand on the 20th floor.
next to the fire exit.
i think he needs ajerk-off extender.
doyle, you're the expert
in hand-to-hand combat.
- man-to-man combat.
- shut up.
- think it might be your dad, doyle.
- you got me.
shit.
- colonel phillips here. what is your status?
- good morning, colonel.
- morning.
- i'm watching the new arrivals disembark.
yes, major?
- it'll take all morning to process them.
- copy.
no one told me that
we're now admitting children.
just follow around to your right.
green and brown. interesting iris variation.
it's usually hereditary.
do one of your parents have the same?
my mother. she did.
- how old are you, andy?
- 12.
i think that makes you
the youngest person in the country.
well, your blood pressure is a-ok
and you're negative
on any serious diseases or afflictions.
i think you're ok to come in.
welcome back to britain.
we are headed for our area
of security and reconstruction
designated as district one.
district one is located on the isle of dogs.
although the isle of dogs is completely safe,
the surrounding area of london is not.
large numbers of bodies are still not cleared
from the original outbreak of infection.
rats and wild dogs are prevalent,
as is disease.
new arrivals are reminded
for their own safety
it is absolutely forbidden to cross the river
and leave the security zone.
you will be joining 15,000 civilians
who are already resident in district one.
as we approach your new home, you'll notice
a dramatically increased military presence.
the us army is responsible for your safety.
we will do everything we can do
to make your repatriation as easy as possible.
inside district one, however,
we believe you'll be pleasantly surprised.
we have hot and cold running water,
a medical centre,
a supermarket and even a pub.
we're nearly home.
- dad! dad!
- it's dad! come on.
- are you excited?
- yeah.
i missed you so much.
are you all right? are you all right?
guys. i never thought
i'd see you again, you know that?
let's get something to eat.
i should have been notified
before children were brought in.
we've not established
the protocol for minors.
we have issues of disease and sanitation.
we don't fully understand the virus yet.
we understand that it did not manage
to go cross-species,
that it did not manage to go airborne and that
the last infected human died six months ago.
- we weren't here six months ago.
- major.
- what are you afraid of?
- what if it comes back?
- it won't come back.
- what if it does?
if it comes back, we kill it.
code red.
come on, guys.
what about this place, then, andy?
yeah, it's pretty good, dad.
look at the camera.
this way. come through.
it's 25 floors. we've got the penthouse
up there. believe me.
id, sir. thank you.
- so, what do you do here, dad?
- what do i do? i'm a section officer.
i keep the lights on, the water running,
the heat running. see this? look.
that says triple a - "access all areas."
that's me. i basically run the place, you know.
no. you're the caretaker really, aren't you?
no, i run the place.
like it?
- it's amazing!
- even better than sunny spain?
you ought to have seen the camps. there
were 20 in each tent and chemical toilets.
- everything smelled of piss.
- nice.
we'll be moving to a new house soon.
a couple of months, in fact.
a new house?
yeah.
listen, i hope you guys understand.
we're not gonna be able
to go back to our old house.
it's outside the security zone and i don't think
i'd want to go back there, even if i could.
what happened, dad? to mum?
yeah.
yeah.
do you wanna sit down
and i'll tell you all about it?
your mum and i were hiding in a house.
a wee cottage.
it was an old couple that owned it
and they were there, too.
three other people.
and we were...
just trying to stay alive, i suppose.
we were doing ok for a while.
and then we were attacked.
they came in through the kitchen window.
they were really fast, you know.
chased us.
chased your mum.
and we were trapped.
trapped in the bedroom.
don!
and i see...
i see them...
biting her.
i couldn't do anything.
i tried to go back.
she was already gone.
she was already gone.
was there nothing you could do?
no, there was nothing i could do.
i managed to get away.
just running, running, running...
i got to this military camp.
and you know the rest. you know i've been
in quarantine waiting for you to come back.
we're just happy you're still alive.
i'm sorry.
doyle...
- doyle, you bastard.
- boy, i've never seen you get so white.
- fuck you.
- good morning.
yeah, fuck outta here, man.
i'm having all good dreams.
sunday afternoon, clear blue skies,
i'm laying in bed with my wife...
and now i'm back in this shithole.
- i know.
- yeah?
i had that same dream about your wife.
- quit fucking with me.
- get outta here.
- all right. next time i'm gonna shoot you.
- all right. see you later, family man.
i told you, i'm gonna shoot you.
what's on the tv tonight?
are you ok? bad dream?
i get worried i'm gonna forget
what she looks like.
you won't forget.
i don't even have a picture of her.
you won't forget.
promise?
yeah.
andy, we agreed.
you heard what they said.
it's only dogs and rats out there.
we'll get what we want and come back again.
- we should've told dad.
- it's fine. trust me.
they won't even know we're gone.
where are you going?
base, come in. we have two strays
who slipped out the north gate.
- stray dogs?
- no, puppies.
- yeah!
- yeah!
yes! yeah!
london's mine!
that's what we need.
yeah, if it had keys.
wait here.
let's go.
there you go.
tam!
tam!
tam?
tammy, are you there?
tam?
tammy!
tammy!
tammy, this is stupid.
you're not being funny.
i knew it.
you're hurting me!
no! no! no! no!
no, don't go! no!
no!
no!
doyle.
i got your puppies.
no!
get off me! get off me!
i apologize for these precautions.
it's standard protocol with any survivors,
though we haven't had to do it for a while.
the last survivor we came across
was over two months ago.
can you tell me anything
about how you managed to keep alive
while you were gone so long?
do you know of any other survivors?
ok.
i'm just going to take a blood sample.
it won't hurt.
have you come into direct contact
with the infected?
ok.
i want to see my children.
of course. of course.
- mr. harris.
- yeah.
- we've found your kids.
- oh, thank god. thank you so much.
we found your wife, too.
can they hear me?
- so, what do you two think you're playing at?
- you said you saw her die.
- what?
- you said you saw her die!
- i didn't say that.
- you did. you did.
baby, i didn't use those words.
this is... i don't know.
i mean, it's confusing, you know.
it's... it's very hard
for you to imagine, you know?
- i... it's too hard to explain.
- well, try to explain it, dad! try!
try? what do you want me to say?
i thought i saw mum... die.
or i wouldn't have told you that.
i was sure.
look, guys, i'm not sure
what's happening here...
but it's good. ok?
that's the point. mum's alive.
i want to see her!
there's no question, sir.
she has the virus. she's infected.
why isn't she showing any symptoms?
- i don't know.
- speculate.
a genetic abnormality which acts
as some sort of natural immunity?
but the virus is still in her blood and saliva,
so technically she's not immune.
she's a carrier.
she has the ability to infect others?
yes, sir. absolutely.
if this woman has natural immunity
she is incredibly valuable.
her blood could contain
the key to a vaccine, even a cure.
alice.
hey, baby.
oh, i'm so sorry. i was scared.
i shouldn't have run away.
i was scared.
please forgive me.
please, sir. we need time to study her.
we need to run some tests.
you can run tests on her corpse, major.
i love you, don.
yeah.
oh, god, i love you, too.
don!

- it's probably nothing.
- tam, it didn't sound like nothing.
he said he'd be back in a moment.

- andy, keep hold of my hand.

come on, people. come on.
- don't push.
- sir, all civilians into the containment area.

- i know what it is. my name is...
- andy!
- scarlet!
andy!
- tammy!

- andy, wait!
- scarlet!
- just wait, andy! we're coming!
- calm down. calm down, now.
move down. move down the room.
keep moving. go, go, go. come on.
- you think it's a drill?
- of course not. someone saw an infected.
keep moving. that's it.
good, good. let's go.
- why are you sealing us inside?
- for your protection.
- just guard the door. don't lock it.
- it's for your own protection.
- we've got to find andy.
- we'll find him.
- shut down civilian areas.
- sector one, lockdown.
- sector eight, lockdown.
- sector three, lockdown.
switch to emergency lighting.

sector one covered.
everyone, stay calm.
dad.
no! my dad... my dad!
he's in here!
no!
containment area, containment area,
move into position.
no!
i confirm, only target infected.
roger that. only target infected.
targeting right. i've had two down.
watch out for the friendlies.
i can't get a shot.
oh, man, this is fubar.
we got a group there at 12 o'clock.
- we've got one at three o'clock.
- on the ground, got four.
i got two by the jeep.
- jesus.
- i don't see who's a target.
on the move! on the move!
moving right! moving right!
i can't find
the designated target here.
i cannot be target-specific.
whiskey three, why have you stopped firing?
come in.
abandon selective targeting.
shoot everything. targets are now free.
we've lost control.
all units, all units, this is medical
commanding officer sierra lima.
please be on the lookout for a young boy,
age 12, name, andy.
if he is located he must be immediately
evacuated from the containment zone.
we have to find andy.
- we have to find him!
- it's ok. it's ok.

- i got him.
- well, take him out. take him out.
doyle, i got two fuckers on me!
fuck.
fuck.
fuck!
tam?
this is madness.
- what's happening?
- they're shooting everybody.
- why? it makes no sense.
- it makes perfect sense.
it's code red.
i saw dad.
where?
he's one of them.
step one, kill the infected.
step two, containment.
if containment fails...
step three, extermination.
now they won't stop until everyone is dead.
so what do we do?
i mean, i'm not sitting around here
to get exterminated.
we've gotta get outta here.
if we take one step out of that door,
if the infected don't get us, the snipers will.
well, you don't have a choice, my friend.
right now it's dark out there. the snipers
can see you through their night scopes,
but at least you have
some limited cover from the infected.
but, you know, if you wanna wait till sun-up
then you're as good as dead.
who are you?
sergeant doyle. delta rooftop unit.
why aren't you at your post?
why aren't you?
look, you guys do what you want,
but i'm gonna get the fuck outta here.
you coming?
all right, come on.
- less shooting.
- maybe it's under control.
or there are less shooters.
all right, listen. i need you guys
to look at me and only me, ok?
you run when i run.
be my shadow. that's it, all right?
get around back. watch her.
ready? let's go.
stay.
doyle, come in.
- flynn, go.
- doyle, where the fuck are you, man?
- ground level, district one.
- shit. close frequency.
copy that.
what the fuck are you doing there?
you got some serious shit coming your way.
- we already got some serious shit.
- i'm not playing. this is worse.
the air cav just got their orders.
they're firebombing all of district one.
- that was fast.
- outbreak is out of control.
they're taking no chances. so unless you are
out of the target zone, you are getting cooked.
- how long we got?
- they're on their way. four minutes, tops.
but listen. i got some clear landing ground
at regent's park. that's the pick-up point.
- i'll be back in touch.
- doyle, you fucking better be.
all right, look, guys, we gotta run.
just stay low and stay fast, ok?
after me. let's go.
- snipers! get down! snipers!
- back! back! back!
get back! get back!
andy, get back!
- back!
- andy, get in!
- shit.
- fuck!
it's ok. it's just a flesh wound.
multiple shots, one hit.
he's a panicker, no marksman.
ok.
- what's your name?
- sam.
ok, sam. come here. get closer.
do you see that doorway?
i need you to run as fast as you can in a
zigzag like this, ok? don't stop for anything.
- you want me to be bait?
- he'll take shots at you, but he'll miss.
he's gonna expose his position.
means i get a shot at him. i won't miss.
- you're out of your fucking mind.
- stay back.
two minutes, we're all gonna die.
you want that?
no!
andy!
fuck!
good work, kid.
- the fence!
- watch it, watch it. behind me.
go! go! go!
come on. come on, come on.
jump!
this is red fox one pouring whiskey.
keep going!
we'll be safe under the river.
go! go!
come on. come on!
run! run!
bring in biological units.
fan out from predesignated positions.
bio units, copy.
use of chemical weapons authorized.
repeat, chemical weapons are authorized.
stay close.
they left us again.
do you think mum's still alive?
not this time.
- you look a little pale.
- blood makes me nauseous.
you never answered my question.
about why you left your post.
when i got that boy in my sights.
that's not a target anymore.
when we were separated...
i thought i'd lost you, too.
we won't get separated again.
we'll stay together, whatever happens.
whatever happens.
it was all fucked.
you could hear it all over the radios. fucked.
anyway, what about you?
- why the hell are you here?
- their mother had very special blood.
a natural kind of immunity to the virus.
not all genetic traits are passed on, you know.
they can skip a generation
or vanish altogether, but...
but they might have it.
it's a possibility.
so their lives are far more valuable than mine.
or yours.
i got it.
doyle!
doyle!
- flynn, go.
- you made it!
i knew you'd do it. listen. i'm coming
to you right now, but keep a lookout.
there's sightings of infected
that have escaped the firebombing.
- give me an eta.
- about 60.
- minutes?
- no. seconds.
kids, come on.
get down. down! down!
i see you. i'm coming in.
jesus, doyle, you got people with you.
who the fuck are those people?
doyle! who the fuck are those people?
i can't take 'em. we will be shot out of the sky
if i try to land at the base.
no, no, don't take 'em to base!
take 'em over the channel!
- what?
- we gotta get these kids outta here.
get the fuck in, doyle!
i'm not taking 'em!
- get me out of here!
- sam, come back!
hey, get the fuck off there!
get that fucker off my ski!
- ok, you wanna fly with me, asshole?
