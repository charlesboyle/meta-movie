look! over there! enemy's aircraft!
over there! look!
alert! be prepared!
hiroshima will be attacked!
find shelter!
find shelter!
where are you going?
help me!
over here!
stop! stop the fire!
hey, you!
go!
go!
that was a b-29, bub.
there's no outrunning what's coming.
yashida!
yashida, what are you doing?!
come here!
yashida, come here!
you're better off down here.
<i>- yashida!</i>
- yes, i'll be right there!
i'd hurry if i were you.
run. now!
stay down!
no, wait!
no, no. wait.
no. it's not safe.
wake up, wake up, wake up.
wake up.
where were you?
nagasaki.
that far back?
you're here.
of course.
can you stay?
you know i can't.
jean, i'm so sorry.
i know.
i'll never hurt you
or anyone ever again.
i made a vow.
a solemn vow?
you're making fun of me.
it's too late.
no! no, jean!
no, no, no! please!
you can't hide.
no, no, no! please!
you can't hide!
no, jean! no!
no.
whack all of that on store credit.
thanks, honey.
- got the arrows?
- yeah.
remember the arrows?
yeah, yeah, eddie,
we got them!
yeah!
hey!
what are you doing?
man, you almost
blew his foot off!
you're not a hunter,
are you?
not anymore.
what the hell?
don't make me do this.
it must have been
damn near 12 feet tall.
we didn't hear
nothing except twigs.
then it just came upon us.
it got riley, just gutted him.
it got eddie.
ripped through the tent, knocked
over the snowcat like it was a toy.
you the one was attacked
by the grizzly?
i'm the one that survived.
i'd like to buy this man a drink.
what's your name, mister?
it's logan.
and that's a poison broadhead,
which, last i heard, was illegal.
go ahead,
ask me where i found it.
ask me.
where did you find it?
well,
funny you should ask.
i pulled it out of
the back of a grizzly.
whoever shot it, didn't
have the wind or the balls
to track the animal properly...
and put it out of its misery.
instead of dropping a lethal
dose of the poison...
it bled into the bear, made him
crazy, killed five people.
i don't know what
you're talking about.
because i don't dip
my arrows in anything.
in that case, you got
nothing to worry about.
damn.
that hurt.
sorry, jean.
i wouldn't bother with them.
most of them will die soon
anyway, without your help.
three of them, a week from
now in the same truck.
this sword is
hundreds of years old...
and was named danzan by the
first samurai who used it.
danzan means "separator"
in japanese.
the ideal weapon for separating
head and limb from body.
whoa!
like so.
i'm parked in back.
get in.
sorry, it's a rental.
who are you?
me? i'm yukio.
and?
i've been trying to find
you for over a year.
why?
to give you that.
my employer
wanted you to have it.
who's your employer?
master yashida.
he said it belongs to you, and
that he's paying all debts.
master yashida is dying.
he wants to say thank you for saving
his life all those years ago.
he knows that you are a...
busy man.
but he very much wants to
say his goodbye in person.
all right, where is he?
tokyo.
wait...
i'm not going to japan.
it would be dishonorable for
you to refuse his request.
well, apologize to mr. yashida,
i'm not going to tokyo.
all right?
i've got things to do.
do not apologize.
it's been an honor just
to meet the wolverine.
that's not who i am
anymore, you understand?
interesting.
why did you go into that bar,
if not to seek justice?
- i don't know.
- you don't know.
- no!
- i think you know.
- pull over.
- you are a soldier.
no, i'm not. pull over.
you are a soldier.
pull over, now!
now.
you are a soldier, and you
seek what all soldiers do.
and what's that?
an honorable death.
an end to your pain.
who says i'm in pain?
a man who has nightmares every
night of his life is in pain.
one day.
i say goodbye to mr. yashida
and i come right back.
okay.
fifteen hours.
depending on the wind.
fifteen hours?
you don't like to fly?
i love it.
<i>kuzuri.</i>
<i>kuzuri.</i>
<i>kuzuri.</i>
<i>kuzuri.</i>
what does that mean?
monster.
no pain?
- you have no...
- oh, yeah. pain.
plenty of pain.
how old are you?
it's been a long time.
many wars.
understand?
too many fuckin' wars.
we are almost there.
so, you can see the future?
i can read a map.
you said you knew the future
of those assholes in the bar.
i know
they are going to die.
we are all going to die.
you said they would die in
the same truck, in a week.
if you're right,
that's quite a talent.
we don't all have claws.
so, do i die on this plane?
no.
not on this plane.
don't let the lights fool you.
these are dark days
in japan.
some believe when
master yashida got sick,
a shadow fell upon us.
do you think he's a god?
no. a man.
but a great one.
after the war, he helped
rebuild the nation.
and the family business
became japan's largest.
wow. did they give you a
little card to memorize?
i owe master yashida
my life.
don't be a dick.
a lot of guns.
there have been attacks.
attempted kidnappings.
attempted assassinations.
by who?
the japanese mob,
the yakuza.
they've grown strong as the
government has grown weak.
- hi has a gun.
- he's alright.
- miss yukio, he has a gun.
- i told you he's alright.
hip replacement.
uh, too small.
too small.
hey.
this way.
who's that?
shingen,
master yashida's son.
he's good.
he's all right.
so, what happened
to the badass in boots?
master yashida is traditional.
one eye on the past
and the other on the future.
that's mariko,
his granddaughter.
mariko.
what's wrong with you?
you haven't
answered my emails.
i can't tell you now.
yes, you can.
who is the caveman?
the man grandfather
wanted me to find.
you can't bring him in
like that.
shizu and saki are going
to disinfect you.
give you a shave.
like hell they are.
get in the tub.
whoa.
get in the tub.
really?
all right.
okay. okay.
all right, all right, all right.
i can do that bit.
what?
what?
you look nice.
i feel violated.
prepare two more suppressors f
or master yashida.
and check his blood pressure.
yashida-sama.
oh...
<i>kuzuri.</i>
you look the same.
but, then,
that is no surprise.
dr. green.
leave us, please.
five minutes, no more.
my oncologist.
well done.
oh, forget the etiquette.
i'm past such precautions.
for many years i have wanted to
thank you for saving my life.
yeah, well...
you were kind to me.
and you were kind
to many people.
i saw that even
from that well.
the painting is from
the village of my birth.
it depicts the bravery and
skill of the black clan.
ninja warriors.
they served my family
for seven centuries.
i didn't send for you
only to thank you, logan.
i wanted to repay you.
to offer you something
no one else can.
a gift to equal
the life you gave to me.
i don't need anything.
not a thing.
eternity can be a curse.
it hasn't been easyforyou,
living without time.
the losses you
have had to suffer.
a man can run out
of things to live for.
lose his purpose.
become a ronin.
a samurai without a master.
i can end your eternity.
make you mortal.
what they did to me,
what i am, can't be undone.
yashida industries
can do anything.
we have reason to believe your
ability to heal can be passed.
passed?
from you to another.
you have struggled
long enough, logan.
i'm confused.
i came here to say goodbye
to a man i once knew.
i am the same man.
i was not ready to die then.
i am not ready to die now.
but you are...
aren't you?
are you offering to kill me?
no.
not right away.
you can live a long
and ordinary life.
fall in love,
have a family...
grow old.
and one day,
die an ordinary death.
it can be done.
yeah, look, nice to see you again.
sorry you got sick.
please, logan-san.
i need you again.
i fear for my family.
i fear for everything
i have built.
- enough.
- please, logan-san.
- you should leave.
- they're going to kill her.
who?
mariko,
my grand daughter.
she is my treasure.
she must be protected.
you don't want
what i've got.
<i>kuzuri.</i>
<i>kuzuri!</i>
lord shingen,
your father is asking for you.
it is time.
father! father, father..
i need to speak with my father...
before he speaks to grandfather.
he'll talk to you later, mariko.
father! i need to see you now!
not now, mariko!
<i>- please, father!
- quiet! </i>
<i>wait, father.
plesase,  listen to me.</i>
not now, mariko.
- plese, listen to me, dad.
- stop bothering me!
- please, listen to me.
- i have no time for this.
- just because grandfather choosen me...
- i told you, shut up!
you just don't care,
that's why grandfather..
careful, careful.
it's slippery out here.
let go.
you about done?
let go of me.
he just wanted
to say goodbye, huh?
you two
grew up together.
yes.
but you're not her sister.
no.
master yashida found me
on a trip to the south.
he brought mariko to see a
factory he was building.
i was digging through the
garbage for something to eat.
so they just took
you home with them?
it was always difficult for
mariko to make friends.
i'll see to it the plane
is ready in the morning.
sleep here.
don't look so sad, shingen.
i'm still dying.
i'll be in my office
if you need me.
there is no easy way to say this.
but then, it's never been
easy for us, has it?
i have tried, father.
you've done the best you can.
you have always been
my assumed successor.
so the past few years,
as a test,
i allowed you
more control.
it has been an honor.
and i now realize
that was a mistake.
you have brought this
company close to ruin.
when i die, someone else will
take my place as chairman.
father, i'm sorry if i
have disappointed you...
let's not insult
one another.
you are not the man
to lead yashida.
you cannot bring in
someone from the outside.
in that,
you are correct.
that will never happen.
<i>eternity
can be a curse...</i>
<i>kuzuri.</i>
<i>you have no pain, kuzuri?</i>
how old are you?
interesting offer.
what are you doing
turning the old man down?
i thought you
wanted to be with me.
come here.
he's dead.
i didn't foresee it.
who's that?
with mariko.
his name is noburo mori.
minister of justice,
a rising star.
he's mariko's fiancé.
you need to bow.
bow.
lord shingen,
this is mr. logan.
i know who he is.
your father
was a good man.
he would often say
the same about you.
but then, he was always
fascinated with your kind.
tell me, why do you think he sent
our little yukio to fetch you?
to say goodbye.
and now you have.
time for you to go
back to your cave.
anyone else
you want me to meet?
i pledge to you...
master yashida...
to be vigilant...
and to dedicate my life...
to protect mariko.
that armor belonged
to shiruba-samurai...
the silver samurai.
it will stand watch
over the old man forever.
logan?
hey.
something's not right.
let go.
logan!
logan!
logan!
<i>kuzuri.</i>
let's go.
come on, let's go!
- yukio!
- mariko!
mariko!
come on.
let's go, let's go.
here, here! here!
move!
in here! move!
keep moving,
keep moving.
move!
you're bleeding.
you need help.
just keep moving.
thank you for
what you did back there.
- those were yakuza.
- i'm fine.
why are they after you?
i'm fine. i can make
my way from here.
you should go.
get yourself a doctor.
whoa!
that's nice.
this is one of those
bullet trains, right?
i told you i don't
need your help.
so what do they do,
like, 300 miles an hour?
this cowardly attack was...
the work of yakuza thugs.
a violent
response to my efforts...
to crack down on
organized crime.
they exited the north gate.
she was with the stranger...
your gaijin friend,
where is he?
last i saw, he was
protecting your daughter.
you are a toy doll.
a companion for a child
who has outgrown you.
keep that in mind.
so, where are we headed,
mariko?
where are we going?
i'm going to the end
of the line.
my family has a home
in the south.
that's stupid.
no offense, but they're gonna
know to look for you there.
not this place.
- but you want to be left alone.
- yes.
- i understand.
- do you?
oh, yeah. trust me.
problem is, if i do that...
i don't think you're gonna live
to see the end of the day.
you can't pretend shit isn't
happening when it is, princess.
unless you want to die. ln that case,
you're playing this perfectly.
oh... what the hell?
oh...
what the hell is happening?
what happened to you?
we get off here.
let's go.
just listen to me, will you?
we need to find someplace safe.
i don't understand. how do
you know they were yakuza?
they were the same guys
from the temple.
how do you know
they were after me?
look, we need to find
someplace safe.
we need to get off
the streets.
- i don't understand.
- shut up! listen.
do you know this place?
where's downtown?
straight ahead.
so, where's the nice part of town?
another eight blocks
that way.
good.
we're staying here.
let's go.
this is a love hotel.
a what?
a love hotel.
for couples,
understand?
uh... right.
hey.
uh, two rooms. adjoining rooms,
on the same floor.
right next to each other.
very close.
same floor. same floor.
what did she say?
she has no rooms available
next to each other.
she's asking if we prefer
"the dungeon", "the nurse's office..."
or the "mission to mars."
this'll do.
<i>lift off! we have a lift off!</i>
kind of homey, actually.
where do you plan
on sleeping?
i don't.
that's a lot of blood.
i thought you were
done being the hero.
but these guys were...
trying to kill her.
just let it go.
it's not hard to die.
come to me.
eh!
oh.
logan...
you're slipping.
logan...
kill him already!
wanna say something
before you die, gaijin?
this is mieko from the hotel
and her grandson, hitoshi.
is he a doctor?
in a manner of speaking, yes.
he's a veterinarian...
student.
large animal.
uh... thanks.
whoa.
you may have cut him once or twice
while he was stitching you.
okay, okay, okay.
hey.
thank you.
i never needed this before.
what? help?
that doctor, the one who helped
your grandfather, the blonde.
who is she?
he met her last year when
he was in america for treatment.
your grandfather told me my
healing could be taken from me,
passed on.
i'm not getting better,
not like before.
she did this to me.
blondie!
blondie!
how much? how much, yeah?
how much?
you kept me waiting two hours.
you have no respect.
so you haven't found them?
don't play with me, bitch.
i could kill you.
if you could make me feel something,
harada, that would be sublime.
i can slit your
pretty mouth open,
before you open it to
say one more stupid...
ah...
i asked you to do
one thing, little man.
bring me the mutant.
i don't work for you.
i work for the house of...
you work for yashida,
i get it.
yet you cannot
fulfill his dying wish.
my god, if you had any idea
how much you have failed him.
where is logan?
i am not done with him.
the mutant has powers.
he's just a man now.
his flesh is weak now.
i did that.
i suppressed his power
so he could be taken.
you see, it's me
you should respect.
just find them,
before the yakuza.
we get off here.
where are we?
just outside nagasaki.
this way.
this is the guy from
the funeral, the archer.
he was your boyfriend.
that's harada.
we were village
champions that summer.
he with the bow
and me with the knives.
harada and i were
planning to get married.
what stopped you?
grandfather.
he said we had to wait
until we were at least 15.
from the mountain,
from the sea.
chopsticks upright
are a bad omen.
it resembles incense
at a funeral.
nothing is without meaning.
so, the other night
at the house,
when you ran out
in the rain...
what did that mean?
my grandfather was dying.
you knew he was gonna die.
he'd been sick
for a long time.
it wasn't
his death i feared.
so, what, then?
what did he tell you
that night?
mariko, why did your father
hit you?
i was trying to warn him.
about what?
what did your grandfather
tell you?
he told me that...
in three days, when
they read his will...
i will become the most
powerful person in japan.
he gave it all to me.
the company?
i didn't want it.
he knew that.
i don't understand
why he gave it to me.
it was all my father
dreamed of.
well, that's why.
what about this fiancé of yours?
nostromo.
noburo.
does he know about this?
no.
why are you
marrying him?
he seems like
kind of an asshole.
my father arranged it
last year.
what?
it gives him a better access
to the political theater.
to disobey my father
would be to dishonor him.
i don't expect
you to understand.
you're not japanese.
our island is long and thin.
trains only run
in two directions.
i assure you
lord shingen...
my officers are
making every effort...
then they're idiots.
you've wasted
enough of my time.
i have my father's affairs
to attend to.
get out and find her!
tell me you have more promising
news from your contacts.
they open the will
in three days.
we are running
out of time.
soon, i hope.
i'm sending men
to the south.
that's where
we found the bodies.
<i>if the yakuza got
into the funeral...</i>
<i>they had someone inside.</i>
they'll never find me here.
you're not safe.
i'm coming down there.
they'll follow you.
please.
wait a few days.
please. i'm fine.
logan's here.
he's wounded, mariko.
someone's here.
mariko?
- i got to go.
<i>- hallo?</i>
mariko?
a tree fell on the road.
the men could use some help.
are you okay?
tired.
do you need something?
no.
this will help.
it's time.
what?
please. take it.
thank you.
no.
two hands.
japanese sword
require two hands.
- like that?
- that's it.
it's beautiful, yashida.
but i can't take it.
please.
thank you.
keep it safe.
keep it safe for me.
someday,
i'll come get it.
it's time.
i was here
when it happened.
it's how i met
your grandfather.
we hid in there.
i heard the stories.
my grandfather would say...
"what happened here was proof that
everything in the world finds peace".
eventually.
that man can
recover from anything.
maybe you, too.
you don't sleep very well.
you call out in the night.
who's jean?
we should go back.
there's rain coming.
i'll make tea.
for you.
this isn't right.
you need this tied
like a proper samurai.
your grandfather
called me a ronin.
a samurai
without a master.
he said i was destined
to live forever...
with no reason to live.
was he right?
yes.
still?
hey.
what are you doing?
this isn't going
to end well.
everyone you love dies.
<i>kuzuri.</i>
do you know
what that means?
an animal.
a fierce creature with long
claws and sharp teeth.
it fears nothing.
when i was a girl,
i had nightmares.
i'd wake up and
run to my parents.
my father
would get angry.
"go back to sleep.
face your fears."
my grandfather
was different.
he told me stories
about <i>kuzuri,</i> his friend.
who he met at the bottom
of a well.
he said the <i>kuzuri</i> was
magical and saved his life.
he said <i>kuzuri</i> would
protect me, too, as i slept in my bed.
who's jean?
is she like you?
what happened to her?
she died.
i killed her.
along with the kuzuri.
logan.
mariko?
logan!
logan!
mariko?
mariko!
no! logan!
no!
logan!
no!
mariko!
logan!
no!
logan!
mariko! mariko!
logan!
where are they
taking her?
where are they
taking her?
where, you piece of shit?
i no talk, <i>gaijin.</i>
i never talk.
who hired you?
uh-oh.
take me to noburo.
- logan.
- take me to him.
i need to tell you
something.
do it. now.
you wait in the car.
- logan.
- what?
i saw you die.
what?
i saw you die.
when? just now?
a while ago.
but it's not like
i get a complete picture.
more like looking
through a keyhole.
but i'm always right.
all i can see is one part
of a person's life...
their death.
and i saw yours.
so, what did you see?
i see you on your back.
there's blood everywhere.
you're holding your own
heart in your hand.
it's not beating.
i don't have time
for this shit.
when i was five, i knew how
my own parents would die.
then i watched it happen
from the back seat.
look at me.
a lot of people have tried to
kill me, and i'm still here.
yeah...
but you're different now,
aren't you?
they can hurt you.
they can kill you.
just wait in the car.
- i said, wait in the car.
- you need backup.
you're not safe,
not in your condition.
just think of me
as your bodyguard.
<i>sexy.</i>
- come on!
- i'm coming.
okay, round four.
here we go.
drink for you, my lady.
get out.
not you.
now call me old-fashioned...
but i thought
being engaged meant
you were done with
this kind of bullshit.
i am the minister of justice.
do you have any idea
what i could do to you?
really? you're gonna
try and talk tough,
standing there in
your red underwear?
you have ten words...
ten words...
to explain to me why you,
the minister of justice...
would want your fiancé
killed by the yakuza.
and if i don't like
what you say,
you are going through
that fucking window.
you don't have the faintest
idea what's going on...
- how many words was that?
- nine.
nine.
you have one word left.
really?
really?
shingen. shingen!
keep going.
since he got sick...
old man yashida spent billions
on doctors, healers.
stockpiling adamantium
at his lab in the north...
secretly trying
to prolong his life.
he brought the company
to the edge of bankruptcy.
he was obsessed
with you.
english!
shingen lied,
protected the old man...
concealed the debt from
stockholders and the board.
he tried to be a good son
and thought he'd be rewarded.
and then the old man left
everything to his granddaughter.
if mariko got all that power,
she would dump his ass.
it's true.
mariko would have never gone
through with the wedding...
not once the will
was revealed.
she never took to me.
oh, really?
a class act like you.
shingen promised me
a fortune for my help.
so, you put a hit on his daughter.
is that it?
political careers
don't last forever.
that's right.
wait! wait! no!
you wanted the truth.
i told you the truth!
i didn't like it.
wow.
how did you know there's
a pool down there?
i didn't.
did you know i studied
biology in college?
genetics.
there are genes
that skip generations.
recessive genes.
eyes.
hair.
talent.
temperament.
not every child
gets the same.
my father saw
little of himself in me.
but in you...
he faced a mirror.
how did you
convince my father...
to award you control...
of asia's largest
corporation?
you've gone insane.
i'm just waking up.
if you kill me,
you will lose...
what little
honor you have left.
fear not marko.
i don't want to hurt you.
i want to help you.
help you end your pain...
what that
mutant stopped you...
from doing last week.
i never wanted
to die, father.
it's alright, mariko.
come with me.
what is happening?!
more than
you can imagine.
you.
me.
sorry to interrupt, but i need
your daughter alive.
what are you?
a chemist, a nihilist...
a capitalist,
a mutation.
a viper.
where is the security?
yakuza.
shingen?
logan.
this. this here.
where is this?
master yashida's birthplace.
the company built a facility
into the mountainside.
how far?
i gotta get that
thing out of me.
how?
no, stop, logan.
i saw you die.
i'm never wrong.
- i'm never wrong.
- you're not always right.
you didn't know the old man
was gonna bite it.
i saw you die in a room like this
with your heart in your hand.
i can't leave her with
those freaks and killers.
i'm the only chance she's got,
but not with that thing inside me.
you're going to die, logan.
maybe that's okay.
no, listen to me, logan!
no, stop. logan!
you're not gonna want
to watch this part.
no! listen to me!
please, no!
no, stop.
listen to me.
logan!
move!
stay away from him.
he killed your master.
put hands on your sister.
and now you want him?
oh, no.
i can't see.
you'll always be a beggar.
you're crazy.
oh, no.
yukio.
logan!
logan! logan!
logan!
don't hit my friends.
where's mariko?
she's gone.
that viper bitch took her.
it was my father's
obsession...
with mutation,
with god's mistakes...
like you and her,
that ruined this house.
you tried to kill
your daughter.
live with that.
what kind
of monster are you?
the wolverine.
hey, come here,
come here. that's it.
i was wrong.
i told you.
let me have a look at you.
it's nothing.
hey, thank you.
it's a trap, logan.
why have you brought me here?
what are you hiding?
you will soon find out.
welcome, mariko.
it's all right, mariko. she also
serves the house of yashida.
she serves herself.
she infected logan.
hmm...
and what about grandfather?
what did you infect him with?
i granted
his dying wish.
i helped him rest.
now, it's your turn.
listen to me, mutant.
she will not be harmed.
she will be fine.
so long as you do your job.
logan will be here soon,
you should prepare.
it was easy
to lure him here.
it's another thing
to capture him.
we're ready.
he's never faced the black clan.
yes, well...
dip your arrows in this.
it won't kill him,
but it will slow him down.
keep your potions.
he's no challenge for us now.
he's weak.
okay.
but when you fail...
you have this.
did you have a nice rest?
i don't know
what you said or did
to deceive harada
or my grandfather...
now, now, calm down.
your grandfather
sought me out.
i am the head
of this family now.
and why do you
suppose that is?
why do you think
the old man chose you?
because you are strong?
or because you are weak?
i see you've come to fight.
it's pointless.
you're weak.
you're out numbered.
the black clan has protected the
house of yashida for 700 years.
is that all the men
you brought?
i'm gonna get her.
we are grateful for your
protection of mariko.
but there is one more sacrifice
you must make for her family.
go fuck yourself,
pretty boy.
yukio, run!
logan.
<i>logan.</i>
<i>kayla.</i>
<i>- i love you.
- kayla!</i>
<i>logan.</i>
<i>- logan!
- mariko!</i>
jean.
<i>save me.</i>
stand back.
there is no need.
where is she?
where's mariko?
where is she?
"where is mariko?"
still pining away?
that's so sweet.
impressive, no?
he is made of adamantium,
just like you.
oh, logan, you know what, i get it.
you're frustrated.
i know she's here.
i want to see her.
you want answers.
yes, i want answers!
i'm sorry,
i wish i could say more,
but i was hired in
part for my discretion.
i'm sure you were.
that...
and a certain talent for combining
biochemistry and metaphysics.
high-grade toxins
are my specialty.
it helps to be
genetically immune
to every poison
known to man, as i am.
and immune to the toxin
that is man himself...
as i am.
i'll tell you what,
you twisted mutant bitch...
why don't you
open these bracelets
and we'll see
who's made of what?
the claws.
now we can begin.
i know you care for him.
you need to let go of that.
you are a yashida.
she betrayed
my grandfather...
and so have you.
no mariko.
we grew up together.
you need to trust me.
let me go to him!
he saved my life!
let him go, mariko!
this isn't easy
for me but...
i'm following
grandfather's wishes.
the suppressant bug you found
inside of you was mine.
you took it out
on your own.
i didn't see that coming.
the viper woman is evil...
we both know that.
but she's a means
to an end...
where is she?
an end your
grandfather wanted.
you are strong.
you have courage.
real courage.
but that won't
help much now.
what the...?
you need to trust me.
is that hard?
we were meant
to be together.
we still can be.
perhaps.
stop!
this is madness.
let's go.
go!
run!
come on.
mariko, come!
go! run!
mariko, get out!
ahhh!
come on.
this is not the way.
two hands.
master...
hey! bub!
harada.
i'm sorry.
now, you die.
today is not my day.
hey!
logan-san.
don't look so shocked.
with you at my side,
i survived nagasaki.
surely,
i could survive this.
it's all right.
it won't take long.
dr. green and i have been waiting.
it's only this armor
that's kept me alive.
we built it to make me strong, so i
can take what you would not give.
and transfer your
unwanted healing...
to my body.
my legacy must
be preserved.
your mistake was to believe
that a life without end...
can have no meaning.
it is the only life that can.
hold on.
we are almost there.
the peace,
the peace you've wanted.
your reward.
you know, i'm giving
you the very death...
you longed for.
this feeling...
to be invincible...
like you.
you are a monster.
mariko.
it's me.
your grandfather.
i buried my grandfather.
you asked me to
come say goodbye.
sayonara.
are you all right?
logan.
logan.
logan.
you're here.
of course.
can you stay?
i can't.
yes, you can.
this is what you wanted.
not anymore.
i'm all alone here.
you put me here.
you were hurting
people, jean.
i had to.
i love you, jean.
i always will.
you are my only family.
be well, sister.
am i wrong to think
you might visit me soon?
stay.
i can't, princess.
i'm a soldier,
and i've been
hiding too long.
<i>in our business
profile tonight, mariko yashida.</i></i>
<i>a two-generation passing of the
torch in the yashida family...</i>
<i>as mariko yashida takes the
helm from her grandfather,</i>
<i>who built this tech giant.</i>
<i>i know it will always be
the purpose</i>

to make a profit...</i>
<i>but yashida industries believes
we can also work with our community.</i>
so, have you decided?
what?
mariko says we can
go wherever we want.
just say where.
what are you doing?
i'm your bodyguard.
so, where do you
want to go?
uh...
let's just start with up.
and then?
we'll see.

i'll take the pat-down.
opt out.
you can go ahead, sir.
i'll wait.
what do you want?
there are dark forces,
wolverine.
human forces
building a weapon...
that could bring about
the end of our kind.
what do i want?
i want your help.
why would i trust you?
you wouldn't.
hello, logan.
how is this possible?
as i told you
a long time ago...
you are not
the only one with gifts.
