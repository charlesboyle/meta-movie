<i>hello, darling. it's your mother.</i>
<i>thank you for showing me
your new apartment. um...</i>
<i>i'm worried about you.</i>
<i>i mean, how can you live like that?</i>
<i>anyway, would you call me back?
let's get together again.</i>
<i>i love you.</i>
(woman moaning)
<i>adam: control.</i>
<i>it's all about control.</i>
<i>every dictatorship
has one obsession.</i>
and that's it.
so, in ancient rome,
they gave the people
bread and circuses.
they kept the populace
busy with entertainment.
but other dictatorships use other
strategies to control ideas.
the knowledge.
how do they do that?
lower education.
they limit culture.
censor information.
they censor any means of
individual expression.
and it's important to remember
this, that this is a pattern
that repeats itself
throughout history.
okay.
see you next week.
(intercom buzzes)
(breathes deeply)
<i>- mary: hi.
- adam: hi.</i>
how are you?
i'm good.
(moaning)
(door slams)
<i>adam: see, every dictatorship,</i>
there's only one obsession
and that's control,
they want to have control
over the people.
in ancient rome, they
gave bread and circuses,
<i>they kept the populace
busy with entertainment.</i>
<i>in other dictatorships,
they have other strategies.</i>
<i>to limit information,
to limit ideas and knowledge.</i>
(moaning)
<i>how do they do that?</i>

(sighs)
(door slams)
man:
you don't go to the movies, do you?
movies?
yeah, are you a movie guy?
in your free time, i mean?
i don't know,
i don't go out that much,
i don't really like movies.
oh.
(both chuckle)
you don't have to go out to
enjoy a good flick at home.
that's true.
i usually just rent them.
most people don't these days,
but it's what i do.
is there a reason why
you're asking me this?
no.
'cause you brought it up and
i thought, you know, maybe
you had a recommendation, or
you saw a movie that you liked
and you want to tell me about it.
oh, sure, i mean,
there's always something.
- i could go for something cheerful.
- hmm.
<i>where there's a will there's a way.</i>
it's true.
no, it's a movie, i saw it a
little while ago, but, um...
i remember, i liked it.
hmm. <i>where there's a
will there's a way.</i>
yeah, that's it.
local film, if you...
i'll keep it in mind.
(pop music playing)
(scoffs)
i think i'm drunk.
you wanna go to bed?
hmm?
you wanna go to bed?
no, i'm gonna finish
grading these papers
and then i'll come join you, okay?
<i>woman: mr. henderson,
my husband will be back.</i>
<i>man: your husband just won a
heck lot of money from me.</i>
<i>by the look in his eye he
didn't have an intention to...</i>
(continues indistinctly)
(end theme music playing)
(sighs)
(sighs)
ow!
(grunts)
(adam moaning)
mary: stop!
stop!
okay, okay, okay.
(both panting)
what's wrong?
i'll call you tomorrow.
(door slams)
(dings)
(inaudible)
(gasps)
(chuckles)
sorry i'm late.
uh...
all right.
last class we talked
about dictatorship,
so today we'll start with hegel.
it was hegel who said that all the
greatest world events happen twice.
and then, karl marx added,
the first time it was a tragedy,
and the second time it was a farce.
<i>(stammering)
it's strange to think...</i>
<i>a lot of the world's
thinkers are worried</i>
<i>that this century will be a
repetition of the last one.</i>
<i>and there's an interesting
observation, a creative act of memory</i>
<i>to remember something,
to remember somebody...</i>
(continues indistinctly)
(chuckles)
(chuckles)
(paper rustling)
(rips)
i'm looking for <i>call me l8r or

(both chuckle)
yeah, so how's everything?

'cause there's no one around.

that we should meet.
anthony: hey, hey, hey, okay. okay.

was a fan of mine.
that he wanted to, uh,
meet up or something.
(laughing)
- what?
- mmm-hmm.
- no.

we need to get something to eat.
let's go get something
to eat and then...

<i>anthony: yeah, it's me, man.</i>
that's so strange. i had a feeling
that you were gonna call.

(stammering) it's a, you know,
just a figure of speech. it's not...
<i>right. all right. well, look,

(line ringing)
<i>anthony: what's up, honey?</i>
<i>hello?</i>
<i>hello?</i>
anthony: (panting) hi.

the last 10 minutes of my run,
this 22-year-old kid or
something like that, he was...
he was following me the whole time.
never gonna beat this kid.
and he dropped.
do you think that i should cut my
beard off 'cause it's fucking hot?
wait, why did you call me earlier?
did you call me for a reason?
(sighs deeply)
honey, where are the blueberries?
where are the blueberries?
i told you, like, two days ago.
the organic blueberries. not
the conventional blueberries.
i can't use 'em in the shake.
what's wrong?
<i>anthony: i wasn't... only i
was saying 'cause i read it</i>
<i>in a magazine that blueberries,</i>
<i>the organic ones are better
than conventional ones...</i>
are you gonna tell me what's wrong?
i...
i went to...
(sighs)
i went to see that guy.
who? what're you talking about?
the guy on the phone.
i went to his work.
why did you do that?
that's dangerous, honey.
i wanted to know.
(sobs)
are you okay?
he had the same voice.
he looks exactly like you.
what do you mean,
"exactly like me"?
(voice breaking) what's happening?
i don't... really don't know
what you're talking about.
i think you know.
(sobs)
i think you know.
(gasps)
hello?
(footsteps approaching)
(lock beeps)
(door opens)
(chuckles)
i told you.
(door closes)
(chuckles)
- show me your hands, man.
- why?
come on, show me your hands.
(chuckles)
maybe we're brothers.
we're not... we're not
brothers. we're not brothers.
how do you know?
do you have a...
do you have a scar on your chest?
this one?
you do, don't you?
i, uh...
- when's your birthday?
- this was a bad idea.
i think i made a mistake here.
um...
i have a...
i have this. i went to...
the company that represents you,
they gave that to me... to you.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
(breathing heavily)
(keys jingling)
anthony: don't worry, honey.
that guy won't be
calling here again.
fuck.
(sighs)
(speaking indistinctly)
mother:
there must be some difference.
there isn't.
it cannot be exactly the same.
we are.
did you take your clothes
off in front of him?
no.
okay, then.
you didn't eat.
the last thing you need is to be
meeting strange men in hotel rooms.
you have enough trouble sticking
with one woman, don't you?
here.
i don't like blueberries.
of course you do,
and they're good for you.
i am going to pretend i never heard
a word of what you just told me.
i just wanted your advice.
you don't want advice. i don't
want to hear any more about this.
you are my only son.
i am your only mother.
you have a respectable job,
you have a nice apartment,
and since we're being frank here,
i think you should
quit that fantasy
of being a third-rate movie actor.
eat those. you want some coffee?
<i>anthony: i have a question for you.</i>
did you fuck my wife?
did you fuck my wife?
did you sleep with my wife?
you fucked my wife!

(chuckles)

giving me your clothes and your car.
i'm gonna take your girlfriend
on a little romantic getaway.
<i>tomorrow, i bring her home.</i>
<i>and i'm gonna come back here,</i>
<i>bring back all your things, and i'm
gonna disappear from your life forever.</i>
<i>and then i'll be gone.</i>
what are you doing here?
what the fuck is this
place, man? you live here?
i have some questions for you.

(snickers)

i don't know.
i don't know. i just...
i needed to know.
you need to know. yeah. okay.
but when you called my house,
you talked to my wife.
why'd you do that?
she happened to pick up the phone.

(chuckles)

just man to man?
um...

i don't know what
you're talking about.

(shouting) i'm fuckin' crazy?
i'm fuckin' crazy?

clothes and your car.
i'm gonna take your girlfriend
on a little romantic getaway.
i'm gonna bring her back home tomorrow,
and i'm gonna come back here,
and i'm gonna bring

(lock beeps)
(sighs)

been there for a long time,
and you had to walk home or
whatever and you must be...
ls everything okay?

so i didn't know. (chuckles)
no, i'm fine.
