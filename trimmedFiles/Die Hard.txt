you don't like flying, do you?
what gives you that idea?
you want to know the secret...
to surviving air travel?
after you get

take off your shoes and socks.

fists with your toes?
<i>[ laughs ]</i>
it sounds crazy,
but i've been doing it

<i>[ laughs ]</i>
okay.
it's okay.
i'm a cop.

i've been doing this

[speaking japanese]

ladies and gentlemen.
ladies and gentlemen!
i want to congratulate
each and every one of you...
for making this
one of the greatest years...
in the history
of the nakatomi corporation.
[applause]
on behalf of
the chief executive officer,
mr. ozu,
and the board of directors,
we wish you
a merry christmas...
and a happy new year!
[crowd]
merry christmas!
happy new year!
hey, holly,
what about
dinner tonight, huh?
harry, it's christmas eve.
families, stockings...
chestnuts...
rudolph and frosty.
any of these things
ring a bell?
actually, i was
thinking more...
of mulled wine,
a nice aged brie,
and a roaring fireplace.
you know what i'm saying?
ginny, it's 5:40.
go join the party.
have some champagne.
you're making me feel
like ebenezer scrooge.
can the baby
handle a little sip?
that baby's ready
to tend bar.
last chance.
bye.
mcclane residence.
lucy mcclane speaking.
hello, lucy mcclane.
this is
your mother speaking.
mommy!
when are you
coming home?
pretty soon.
pretty soon.
you'll be in bed
when i get there, though.
let me talk to paulina.
and no snooping
around the house,
looking for presents.
is daddy coming home
with you?
well, we'll see what...
santa and mommy
can do, okay?
put paulina on.
bye, honey.
paulina!
<i>hola,</i> mrs. holly.
um, did mr. mcclane call?
no, mrs. holly.
no <i>telefono.</i>
well, he probably just
didn't have time...
before his flight.
um, make up
the spare bedroom...
just in case.
<i>si,</i> mrs. holly.
i do that already.
what would i do
without you, paulina?
oh!
california.
hey, i'm john mcclane.
argyle.
i'm your limo driver.
nice bear.
okay... argyle.
what do we do now?
you tell me.
it's my first time
driving a limo.
this is my first time
riding in one.
relax. we got everything
in this mug, man.
look at this--
cd, cb, tv,
telephone, full bar, vhs.
[ laughs ]
if your friend's
hot to trot,
i know a few
mama bears.
or is he married?
he's married.
okay.
oh, sorry about that.
it's the girl's day off.
i didn't know
you were gonna sit up front.
so, uh, your lady
live out here?
about the past
six months.
meaning you still
live in new york?
you always ask
this many questions, argyle?
sorry, man.
i used to drive a cab.
people would expect
a little chitchat.
so you divorced?
just drive the car, man.
come on.
you divorced?
you separated?
she beat you up?
<i>[ laughing ]</i>
she had a good job.
it turned into
a great career.
<i>that meant</i>
<i>she had to move here.</i>
you're very fast, argyle.
<i>so why didn't you come?</i>
<i>well?</i>
what's up?
because i'm
a new york cop.
i got a six-month backlog
of new york scumbags.
i can't just pick up
and go that easy.
you thought
she wouldn't make it out here,
so why bother
to pack, right?
like i said,
you're very fast, argyle.
you mind if we
hear some tunes?
[ funky r&b intro ]
hey, that will work.
don't you got
any christmas music?
this <i>is</i> christmas music.
<i># it was december 24th
on hollis ave. after dark #</i>
<i># when i seen a man chillin'
with his dog in the park #</i>
<i># i approached them
very slowly #</i>
<i># with my heart full of fear
looked at his dog #</i>
<i># oh, my god,
a ill reindeer#</i>
<i># but then i was illin'
'cause the man had a beard #</i>
<i># and a bag full of goodies
<i># so i turned my head a second #</i>
<i># and the man was gone #</i>
<i># but he must have
dropped his wallet #</i>
<i># smack dead on the lawn #</i>
<i># i picked the wallet up,
and then i took a pause #</i>
<i># took out the
license and it cold said ''santa claus''#</i>
<i># a million dollars in it
cold hundreds of g's #</i>
so your lady sees you,
the music comes up,
and you live happily
ever after, right?
i can live with that.
if it doesn't work out,
you got a place to stay?
i'll find a place.
tell you what.
i'll wait
in the parking garage.
you score, you call
on the car phone.
you strike out,
i'll get you a hotel.
you're all right, argyle.
just remember that
when you sign for the tip.
hi.
good evening.
i'm here to see
holly mcclane.
just type it in there.
cute toy.
if you have to
take a leak,
it finds
your zipper.

they're the only ones
left in the building.

until you hear the noise.

<i>[crowd noise]</i>

oh, i'm sorry.
hey, merry christmas!

hi.
i'm looking for--
holly gennero.
yeah.
you must be
john mcclane.
joe takagi.
how was your ride in?
i have you to thank?
seemed the least
we could do.
quite a place
you have here.
it will be.
several floors are
under construction.
holly went to fax
some documents.
in the meanwhile,
her office is
right back here.
<i>- [sniff]</i>
- ellis.
[sniff]
i was just making a call.
i want you to meet
john mcclane,
holly's husband--
holly's policeman.
ellis is in charge of
international development.
heard a heck of a lot
about you.
missed some.
[sniff]
can i get you anything?
food? cake?
some watered-down
champagne?
no, thank you.
i'm fine.
you throw quite a party.
i didn't realize...
they celebrated
christmas in japan.
pearl harbor
didn't work out,
so we got you
with tape decks.
actually, it's sort of
a double celebration.
holly helped us close
a big deal today.
<i>i'll be out in</i>
<i>a couple of minutes.</i>
john.
have you met everyone?
we've been
sticking him with spears.
of course, he has.
she was made
for the business.
tough as nails.
i was hoping...
you made that flight.
show him the watch.
later.
go on.
show him.
what, are you
embarrassed?
<i>a token of appreciation</i>
<i>for her hard work.</i>
it's a rolex.
i'm sure
i'll see it later.
is there a place
where i could wash up?
sure.
ellis gets very depressed...
this time of year.
he thought he was
god's greatest gift.
yeah.
i know the type.
think he's got
his eye on you.
that's okay...
i have my eye...
on his private bathroom.
where you staying?
things happened so fast,
i didn't get
a chance to ask you.
cappy roberts
retired out here.
he told me
i could bunk with him.
cappy retired, huh?
where's he live?
ramona.
[ laughs ]
pomona.
huh?
<i>pomona.</i>
pomona.
yeah.
[ laughs ]
you'll be in the car
half the time.
why don't we make it easy?
i have a spare bedroom.
it's not huge
or anything, but...
the kids would love
to have you at the house.
they would, huh?
i would, too.
[ laughing ]
ooh!
sorry.
i missed you.
i guess you didn't
miss my name, though, huh?
except maybe when
you're signing checks?
since when are you
'' ms. gennero''?
this is
a japanese company.
- they figure
a married woman's got-- - you are a married woman.
- you're married to me.
- are we going to have this conversation again?
- we never finished
this conversation in july. <i>- i had an opportunity--</i>
- i had to take it.
- right, no matter what the consequences.
- no matter what it did
to our marriage. - it didn't do anything...
except change your idea
of what our marriage should be.
- you don't have a clue what my
idea of our marriage should be. - i know exactly...
what your idea
of our marriage should be.
ms. gennero, i--
excuse me.
hi.
um, mr. takagi
is looking for you.
<i>he wants you</i>
<i>to say something to the troops.</i>
speech time.
be back in
a few minutes.
that was great,john.
good job.

that's beautiful.
i always enjoyed

when i was a boy.
the exactness,
the attention to every

it's beautiful.
is this what this is all about?
our project in indonesia?
<i>contrary to what</i>
<i>you people may think,</i>
<i>we're going to</i>
<i>develop that region,</i>
<i>not exploit it.</i>
i believe you.
i read the article
in <i>forbes.</i>
mr. takagi,
i could talk about industrialization
and men's fashions all day,
but i'm afraid
work must intrude,
and my associate here
has some questions for you.
sort of fill-in-the-blanks
questions, actually.
[beeping]
i don't have that code!
you broke in here
to access our computer?
any information you could get,
when they wake up in tokyo, they'll change it.
<i>you won't be able to blackmail</i>
<i>our executives, threaten our pro--</i>
sit... down!
mr. takagi,
i'm really not interested...
in your computer.
but i need the code key...
because i <i>am</i> interested
in the $640 million...
in negotiable bearer bonds...
that you have
locked in your vault.
and the computer
controls the vault.
you want money?
what kind
of terrorists are you?
[ chuckling ]
who said
we were terrorists?
<i>the bonds represent</i>
<i>at most ten days'...</i>
<i>operating capital</i>
<i>for your parent organization.</i>
the code, please.
it's useless to you.
there are seven vault safeguards,
and the code key's only one of them.
you'll never get it open.
then there's no reason
not to tell us.
i told you.
it's not over yet.
it's a very nice suit...
mr. takagi.
it would be a shame
to ruin it.
i'm going to
count to three.
<i>there will not be a four.</i>
give me...
the code.
one...
<i>two...</i>
- three.
- i don't know it. i'm telling you!
get on the jet to tokyo
and ask the chairman.
i'm telling you.
you're just gonna have to kill me.
okay.
we'll do it
the hard way.
tony, see if you
can dispose of that.
karl, better check
on heinrich's work.
<i>[ grunting ]</i>
nothing.
see to heinrich.
now...
you can
break the code?
you didn't
bring me along...
for my charming
personality.
argyle, tell me
you heard the shots.
you're callin'
the police right now.
<i>[ loud music ]</i>
of course
i'm coming by later.
have i ever lied to you?
my boss?
thinks i'm on my way to vegas.
uli, get up on the pipes.
marco, you go
through here.
i'll throw you the cord.
hans, we're on the roof.
here.
thirty minutes
to break the code,
two hours, two and a half hours
for the five mechanicals...
at the minimum.
the seventh lock,
however, is out of my hands.
i'm sorry--
the seventh lock--
the electromagnetic seal.
you do understand...
the circuits cannot
be cut locally.
trust me.
why the fuck
didn't you stop him,john?
'cause then
you'd be dead, too, asshole!
think, goddamn it!
think!
[beeping]
we've got a fire alarm.
call 91 1 .
give them the guard's name
and the building code number,
and cancel the alarm.
then disable the system.
on what floor
did the alarm go off?
now, shall we go?
<i>nein.</i>
[sirens]
oh, baby, come to papa.
come on.

<i>i'll kiss</i>

you stupid motherfuckers!
no!

the fire has been
called off, my friend.
no one is coming to help you.
you might as well
come out and join the others.
i promise
i won't hurt you.
<i>[whirring]</i>
drop it, dickhead.
it's the police.
you won't hurt me.
yeah? why not?
because
you're a policeman.
there are rules
for policemen.
yeah. that's what
my captain keeps telling me.
aah!
you bet your ass
i wish to proceed.
nine million terrorists
in the world,
and i got to kill one
with feet smaller than my sister.
i wanted this
to be professional,
efficient, and cooperative.
not a lot to ask.
alas, mr. takagi
did not see it that way,
so he won't be joining us
for the rest of his life.
<i>we can go</i>
<i>any way you want it.</i>
<i>you can walk out</i>
<i>or be carried out,</i>
but have no illusions--
we are in charge.
<i>- so... decide now, each of you,</i>
<i>- [ elevator bell dings ]</i>
<i>and please remember...</i>
<i>we have left nothing</i>
<i>to chance.</i>
- [speaking german]
<i>- [ screaming continues ]</i>
get them back!

'' now i have
a machine gun.
<i>ho-ho-ho. ''</i>
a security guard
we missed?
they're usually
just growing fat on a pension.
this is
something else.
[speaking german]
we have to do
something, hans.
yes, we do.
tell karl his brother is dead.
tell him
to come down.
<i>karl...</i>
<i>komm sofort.</i>
<i>franco,you and fritz take</i>
<i>the body upstairs and out of sight.</i>
<i>i don't want the hostages</i>
<i>to think too much.</i>
<i>[speaking german]</i>
aah!
i want blood!
but let heinrich
plant the detonators.
the police will waste hours
trying to negotiate.
then you can
tear the building apart.
but until then,
do not alter the plan.
and if he alters it?
[ellis]
what do you think?
something's wrong.
cops?
john.
<i>john--aw, christ!</i>
<i>he can fuck this whole thing up!</i>
<i>what does</i>
<i>he think he's doing?</i>
his job.
bullshit. his job's
without him, we might
be able to get out of here.
tell that to takagi.
mayday. mayday,

terrorists have seized
the nakatomi building...
<i>and are holding</i>

all of you relax.
this is a matter

and, as it happens,
necessary.
let them fumble about outside,
and stay calm.
this is simply the beginning.
[static]
i thought i told all of you
i want radio silence.
i didn't get
that message, hans.
you should have put it
on the bulletin board.
since i waxed tony and marco
and his friend,
i figured you and karl
and franco might be lonely.
how does he know
so much--
that's very kind of you.
i assume you are
our mysterious party crasher.
you are most troublesome
for a security guard.
eeeh! sorry, hans.
wrong guess.
want to go
for doublejeopardy,
where the scores
can really change?
mm, these are
very bad for you.
who are you, then?
the fly in
the ointment, hans.
the monkey
in the wrench,
the pain in the ass.
whoa!
don't use the radio.
see if he's lying about marco.
find out who's missing.
mr. mystery guest,
are you still there?
yeah, i'm still here,
unless you want to open
the front door for me.
i'm afraid not,
but you have me
at a loss.
you know my name,
but who are you?
just another american...
who saw too many movies
as a child?
another orphan

a chance, mr. cowboy?
yippee-kai-yay,

<i>- the leader's name is hans.</i>
- we have to find him and shut him up.
- he's telling them everything!
- let him. i'm waiting for the fbi.
until then, he can waste
as much time as he likes,
but we must find
the bag, fritz.
we must have
the detonators.
<i>[john] they got</i>
<i>missiles, automatic weapons,</i>
<i>and enough explosives</i>
<i>to orbit arnold schwarzenegger.</i>
they're down to nine now.
these guys
are mostly european,
judging by
their clothing labels and...
cigarettes.
they're well-financed
and very slick.
how do you
know that?
i've seen
enough phony i.d.s...
to recognize that the ones
they got must have cost a fortune.
add all that up,
i don't know
what the fuck it means,
but you got some bad-ass
perpetrators here to stay.
i hear you, partner.
l.a.'s finest are on it.
light 'em
if you got 'em.
way ahead of you, partner.
so, what do i call you?
call me...
roy.
if you think of
anything else,
don't you be shy, okay?
in the meantime,
let us do our job.
<i>they're all yours, al.</i>
all right,
who's talking to him?
i am, sir. sergeant powell.
al powell.
dwayne robinson, powell.
what's the deal here?
what do
these pricks want?
well, we don't exactly know.
we haven't heard from them.
who have you been talking to?
we don't know.
he won't give us his name.
he appears to be
the one who phoned.
he's killed
one terrorist,
and he claims two others.
claims? powell,
has it occurred to you...
he could be one
of the terrorists...
<i>or some nutcase in there?</i>
no. in fact,
i think he's a cop--
maybe not l.a.p.d.,
but he's a badge.
why?
a hunch,
things he said,
like being able
to spot a phony i.d.
jesus christ, powell.
he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
tv's here.
oh, shit.
[horn honks]
<i>[music playing]</i>
i have a request.
what idiot
put you in charge?
you did...
when you murdered
my boss.
now everybody's
looking to me.
personally,
i'd pass on the job.
i don't enjoy being
this close to you.
go on.
we have
a pregnant woman.
relax. she's not due
for a couple weeks,
but sitting on that rock isn't
doing her back any good.
so, i would like permission
to move her to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
i'll have a sofa
brought out. good enough?
good enough.
unless you
like it messy,
start bringing us
in groups to the bathroom.
yes. you're right.
<i>it will be done.</i>
<i>was there</i>
<i>something else?</i>
no, thank you.

man, that's crazy!
there could be
over 30 hostages!

how come there were

somebody shot your car.
it's probably the same

<i>you've been</i>

probably some stockbroker--

we've had
an update on the takeover of the nakatomi building--
sources say
the terrorist leader, '' hans,''
may be this man--
hans gruber,
a member of the radical
west german <i>volksfrei</i> movement.
strangely,
the <i>volksfrei</i> leadership...
issued a communique
an hour ago...
stating gruber had been expelled
from that organization--
[john]
al? al? do you copy?
are you all right?
yeah, i'm fine.
[coughing]
what was that?
remember that plastic
explosive i told you about?
there you go.
is the building on fire?
no, but it's going to
need a paint job.
our spotter said
you got two that time.
is that him?
yes, sir.
i don't know
who you think you are,
but you just destroyed
a building.
we do not want your help.
is that clear?
i've got 1 00 people
down here,
and they're covered
with glass.
who gives a shit
about glass?
who the fuck is this?
this is deputy chief of police,
dwayne t. robinson,
and i am in charge
of this situation.
oh, you're in charge?
i got bad news
for you, dwayne.
it doesn't look like you're
in charge of jack shit.
- listen to me, you little asshole--
- asshole?
i'm not the one who just got
buttfucked on national tv, dwayne!
<i>listen to me,jerkoff,</i>
quit being part
of the fucking problem...
and put the other guy
back on!
hey, roy, how are
you feeling?
pretty fucking
unappreciated, al.
hey, look.
i love you.
so do a lot
of the other guys.
you hang in there.
you hear me?
you hang in there.
yeah, thanks, partner.
what are you doing?
i'm tired
of waiting to see...
who gets us killed first--
them or your husband.
what are you
going to do?
hey, babe, i negotiate
million-dollar deals for breakfast.
i think i can
handle this '' euro-trash.''
hey,
<i>sprechen sie,</i> talk?
if you'd listened to me,
he'd be neutralized.
- i don't want neutral. i want dead.
<i>- [ knocking ]</i>
hope i'm not
interrupting.
what does he want?
it's not
what i want.
it's what
i can give you.
<i>oy, let's be</i>
<i>straight, okay?</i>
it's obvious you're not
some dumb schmuck up here...
to snatch a few purses,
am i right?
very perceptive.
i watch
<i>60 minutes.</i>
i say to myself,
''these guys are professional,
''they're motivated,
they're happening,
i.e., they want
something,'' huh?
<i>i couldn't care less</i>
<i>about your politics.</i>
maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys,
maybe it's the hebes,
northern ireland--
it's none
of my business.
i figure you're here to negotiate.
am i right?
you're amazing.
you figured this
all out already?
hey, business
is business.
you use a gun.
i use a fountain pen. what's the difference?
let's put it
in my terms.
you're here on a hostile takeover.
you grab us for some greenmail,
<i>but you didn't expect</i>
<i>some poison pill running around.</i>
am i right?
hans, bubby, i'm
your white knight.
i must have missed
<i>60 minutes.</i>
what are you saying?
the guy upstairs is
fucking things up, huh?
i can give him to you.
<i>[john]</i>
<i>oh, god...</i>
uhh...
roy?
roy,
you all right?
just trying to fire down
a 1 ,000-year-old twinkie.
what do they put
in these things anyway?
sugar, enriched flour,
partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil,
polysorbate 60...
and yellow dye
number five--
just everything
a growing boy needs.
how many kids
you got, al?
my wife is working
on our first.
how about you,
cowboy?
you got any kids?
yeah... two.
hope i can see 'em
swingin' on a jungle gym with aljr. someday.
[ chuckling ]
well, now,
that's a date,
but you bring
the ice cream.
<i>[hans]</i>
<i>touching, cowboy. touching.</i>
<i>or should i call you...</i>
mr. mcclane.?
mr. officerjohn mcclane...
<i>of the new york</i>
<i>police department?</i>
- get on the phone to harry
in new york. come on, baby. move.! - got it.
better get a hold
of somebody at dispatch.
sister theresa called me
mr. mcclane in the third grade,
my friends call mejohn,
and you're neither,
shithead.
i have someone
who wants to talk to you--
a very special friend...
<i>who was with you</i>
<i>at the party tonight.</i>
hey,john boy.
ellis?
yeah.
now, listen,john.
they're giving me
a few minutes...
to try to talk
some sense into you.
i know you think
you're doin' your job,
but you're just
draggin' this thing out.
<i>no one gets out of here</i>
<i>until these guys can talk...</i>
to the l.a. police, and that
just ain't gonna happen...
till you stop messing up
the works, <i>capisci?</i>
ellis, what have
you told them?
i told them
we were old friends,
and you were
my guest.
you shouldn't
be doing this.
tell me about it.
all right,john,
listen.
they want you to tell them
where the detonators are.
they know people
are listening.
they want
the detonators,
or they're
going to kill me.
john, didn't you
hear me?
yeah, i hear you.
john, get
with the program.
tell these guys...
where
the detonators are...
so no one else
gets hurt!
i'm putting my life
on the line, pal!
[john] ellis,
listen to me carefully.
john--
shut up, ellis!
just shut your mouth!
put hans back on!
hans, this shithead doesn't
know you, but i do--
good. then you'll
give us what we want.
you're not part
of this equation.
what am i,
a method actor?
[ellis]
put away the gun.
this is radio,
not television.
hans, he's not my friend!
i don't know him!
jesus, ellis!
they'll kill you!
tell them
you don't know me!
how can you say that
after all these years?
john? john?
[ laughs ]
[gunshot]
[screaming]
do you hear that?
talk to me! where
are my detonators?
where are they,
or shall i shoot
another one?
sooner or later,
i'll get to someone
you care about.
go fuck
yourself, hans.
did you hear that?
he just let
the guy die, man.
man, can't you see
what's happening?
can't you read
between the lines?
he did everything
he could...
to save him.
if he gave up,
they'd both be dead!
no. they'd be
talking to us.
you tell your partner
to stay out of this.
if he doesn't,
i'm going to
nail his ass.
the man is hurting.
he is alone, tired,
and he hasn't seen
diddly-squat...
from anybody here!
you think
he'll give a damn...
about what you do
<i>if</i> he makes it?
wake up and smell
what you shoveling.
anytime you want
to go home,
you consider
yourself dismissed.
no, sir.
you couldn't drag me away.
<i>[hans]</i>
<i>attention, police.</i>
<i>[hans]</i>
<i>attention, police.</i>
attention, police.
this is sergeant
al powell--
this is deputy chief
dwayne robinson.
who is this?
this is hans gruber.
i assume you realize
the futility of direct action.
we have no wish
for further loss of life.
well, what is it
you do wish for?
i have comrades
around the world...
languishing
in prison.
the american
state department...
enjoys rattling its saber
for itself.
now it can rattle it
for me.
the following are to be
released from their captors--
the seven members
of the new provo front,
in canada, the five imprisoned
leaders of <i>liberté du quebec,</i>
in sri lanka, the nine members
of the asian dawn.
what the fuck?
i read about them
in <i>time</i> magazine.
when these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,
the hostages will be
taken to the roof...
and will accompany us
in helicopters...
to the los angeles
international airport...
where they'll be given
further instructions.
you have two hours
to comply.
wait a minute,
mr. gruber.
this is crazy.
i don't have
the authority.
two hours
is not enough.
hello? hello!
did you get
all that?
we got to make
some calls.
do you think
they'll try?
who cares?
theo, are we
on schedule?
one more. then
it's up to you.
this one will
take a miracle.
it's christmas, theo.
it's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer.
call me when you hit
the last lock.
hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.
fritz is checking
the explosives.
i'll check
the explosives.
hey, powell,
you out there?
i'm here,john.
i'm here.
believe me, there was
nothing i could do.
it's gonna be
both our asses...
if you're wrong.
i hear you.
did you catch that bullshit
hans was running?
it doesn't
make sense, man.
i'm just
a desk jockey...
who was on my way
home when you rang.
the way you drove,
i figured you
for the street.
in my youth.
in my youth.
<i>...author of</i> hostage terrorist,

a study in duality.
<i>what can we expect</i>
<i>in the next few hours?</i>
the hostages
are probably experiencing...
the early stages
of the helsinki syndrome.
as in helsinki,
sweden.
finland.
basically, it's when
the hostages...
and the terrorists...
go through a sort of
psychological transference...
and a projection
of dependency.
<i>a strange sort of trust</i>
<i>and bond develops.</i>
<i>we've had situations</i>
<i>where the hostages...</i>
<i>embraced their captors</i>
<i>after release...</i>
<i>and even corresponded</i>
<i>with them in prison.</i>

i won't hurt you!

what the fuck are
you doing up here?
what were you
looking for?
i managed to get
out of there.
i was trying to get
up on the roof...
and see if i could
signal for help.
why don't you
come and help?
hold it. hold it.
forget the roof.
forget the roof.
they got people
all over it.
you want to stay alive,
you stay with me.
the best
we can figure it,
we've got maybe 30 or 3 5
hostages up there,
probably
on the 30th floor,
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.
sounds like
an a-7 scenario.
we'll handle it
from here.
when we
commandeer your men,
we'll let you know.
aren't you...
forgetting something?
such as?
what about
john mcclane?
he's the reason...
we have
any information.
he's also the reason...
you're only facing
seven terrorists.
he's inside?

he might be a cop.
we're checking.
one of yours?
no way.
you smoke?
yeah.

my detonators.

put it down now.
that's pretty tricky

i already used

i'm going to
count to three.

get you off the street.
you don't think
jockeying papers...
is a noble effort?
<i>no.</i>
i had an accident.
<i>the way you drive,</i>
<i>i can see why.</i>
you run over
your captain's foot?
i shot a kid.
<i>he was 1 3 years old.</i>

we let them sweat,

right up the ass.

no, the other one.

yeah!
i wish to talk to the fbi.
this is

the state department
has arranged...
for the return
of your comrades.
helicopters are en route
as you requested.
we'll be ready.
when he realizes
what hit him,
he'll be dead.
when they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.
by the time
they figure out...
what went wrong,
we'll be sitting
on a beach...
earning 20%.
ah!jeez!
powell?
yo, powell, you got a minute?
i'm here,john.
i'm starting to get
a bad feeling up here.
i want you to do
something for me.
um...
i want you
to find my wife.
don't ask me how.
i want you
to tell her something.
i want you
to tell her that...
um...
mmm...
tell her it took me
a while to figure out...
what a jerk i'd been,
but, um...that...
that when things started
to pan out for her,
i should have been
more supportive,
and, uh...
i just should have
been behind her more.
oh, shit.
tell her that, um...
that she's the best thing
that ever happened...
to a bum like me.
she's heard me say
''i love you''
a thousand times.
she never heard me
say ''i'm sorry.''

tell her that, al.
i want you
to tell her...
thatjohn said
that he was sorry.
okay?
you got that, man?
yeah, i got it,john,
but you can
tell her that yourself.
just watch your ass
and make it out.
you hear me?
i guess that's up to
the man upstairs.
[al]
john? john?
what the fuck...
were you doing
upstairs, hans?
john?
al, listen.
just lay off
for a while.
<i>i got to go</i>
<i>check on something.</i>

speeches,
you're nothing
but a common thief.

mrs. mcclane,
and since i'm moving
up to kidnapping,
you should be
more polite.

eat you!

like this, sarge.

so that's what this
is all about?

why'd you have to nuke
the whole building, hans?
well, when
you steal $600,
you can disappear.

they'll find you...
unless they think
you're already dead.
put down the gun.

a good cowboy
yourself, hans.
