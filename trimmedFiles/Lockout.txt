again.
what happened in
that motel room?
it was coupon night and i
was trampolining your wife.
you're a real comedian,
aren't you, snow?
well, i guess that's why
they call it the punch line.
you don't like me, do you?
don't flatter yourself.
i don't like anybody.
with that attitude i can
see why nobody likes you.
come on.
people love me.
just ask your wife.
what happened in that
room in new york?
what? what was the question?
what happened in that room?
- <i>mace?</i> - <i>why do you
never answer your phone?</i>
what the hell's going on?
<i>listen. you have
to get out, okay?</i>
<i>it's a double cross. they're coming
for you. you have to get out now!</i>
yeah. yeah, okay.
who was the mystery
man on the phone?
his name was fuck you.
- really? - yeah,
he was asian.
i don't like hurting you, snow.
is that why you're
having him do it?
i can have rupert
bludgeon you all night.
i'm being beaten up by
a guy called rupert?
what happened with the colonel?
shit.
hey, buddy.
no, no, no, frank.
you're gonna be fine.
don't let them take this.
yeah, okay.
stay with me.
come on, you're gonna be okay.
frank.
returning fire.
god, i hate heights.
watch out!
- <i>mace!</i>
- <i>where are you?</i>
<i>get to the subway,
wilson platform 10.</i>
<i>and dump the phone! they're
using it to track you!</i>
we have him now!
don't move!
and that's when you showed up.
we had the colonel
under surveillance.
he was selling secrets
about our space programs.
well, that's interesting
because frank told me
he was protecting them.
did he tell you this before
or after you killed him?
why would i kill him? he
was a friend of mine.
you're right.
- that's not what happened.
- i saw it with my own eyes.
running out of jokes, are we?
you setting me up? is
that what this is?
all we know is that the colonel
arranged for a meeting in that motel
and somehow,
you showed up and killed him.
pop.
you know, this may come
as a surprise to you,
but frank didn't trust
you guys anymore,
so he asked me to back him up.
he wanted someone from outside the agency.
you know, to protect the package.
who was your backup guy?
why do i get the feeling
not telling you
is the only thing
keeping him alive?
hey, hey, hey, hey. come on.
come on, guys.
play nice.
- you mind? - no.
he's all yours.
get those off of him, please.
i can't tell if he's stupid
or a really good liar.
either way, m.s. one would
have been good for him.
guy's a tool. nut?
nah, i'm trying to give them up.
i was sorry to hear about frank.
he was one of the good guys.
snow, you gotta
give me something.
otherwise, i can't help you.
tell me what i can
do to help, snow.
shoot langral?
- anything else? - can you
pick me up something?
i can. what and where?
i don't know.
last time i saw it,
it was on a train.
hey, buddy. hey!
tell me who the backup guy was.
you think i'm gonna
tell you that?
you'll go straight to your boss.
well, i guess this
conversation's over.
it's good to see you.
i need a polcom tag and a
trace on a name. mace.
- mr. president.
- scott, come in.
this is just routine.
won't take two seconds.
thank you.
they check this damn
thing five times a year.
so, what have we got?
he claims he was set up.
was he?
i saw him shoot armstrong
with my own eyes, sir.
what a mess!
so what do you want
us to do about him?
i don't even want to know.
just fix it.
we're pretty much done here. i just
need to see the first daughter.
emilie has had a change in schedule.
she's on a humanitarian errand.
is she even in washington?
<i>well, not exactly.</i>
<i>ground control to
lm22, do you copy?</i>
- <i>loud and clear.</i>
- <i>it's amazing.</i>
- is this your first
time in orbit? - no.
my father took me up in the hilton
orbital after my mother passed.
would you like a quick
briefing before we arrive?
please.
m.s. one has been a very
successful experiment
with the first 500 test cases
serving time without incident.
once we open for
business properly,
we'll be able to rent space
to 500,000 prisoners and counting,
with all countries signed up.
all overseen by the
united states of america.
which is why i'm here.
m.s. one is the only supermax
facility in existence
where there is no
physical or sexual abuse,
breakouts or riots.
because you put the
prisoners to sleep?
it's called stasis.
of course, but there are a few
issues with stasis, are there not?
aggression due to
damage of the cortex,
dementia, psychosis.
well, you know the press.
good news doesn't sell.
those were early
teething problems.
the u.s. has absolutely
nothing to worry about.
<i>you are entering united
states airspace.</i>
- we're approaching. would you
like to see it? - i'd love to.
<i>this is penal area m. s. one.</i>
<i>446 requesting
identification code.</i>
<i>lm22, we need your
coordinates...</i>
the defense system is
automatic and solar assisted,
oxygen-fed, auto lock,
made by milland aerospace.
<i>lm22, please
transmit clearance.</i>
what are they doing?
parts of m.s. one are still under
construction and need constant maintenance.
<i>lm22, you are on
final approach.</i>
<i>maintain your current
speed and heading.</i>
- can everyone please sign in?
- how are you, sir?
there are just a few basic
precautions here. won't take long.
- thanks, sam. can i get my
holster? - there you go, sir.
please, keep your radiation
tags on you at all times.
in the event of a problem, they
will beep and flash yellow.
would you please take the
elevator to the third floor?
mr. barnes, isn't m.s.
one's true purpose
to test the effects of deep
space exploration on humans?
who better than guinea
pigs with no rights?
i've heard that urban legend.
look, ms. warnock, these men
aren't traffic offenders.
they've done some pretty
awful things to get in here.
of course.
but is it purely coincidental that
one of the main sources of funding
is a deep space
exploration company?
surely you don't think they're paying out
millions of dollars to be civically minded?
ms. warnock, i'm just
an old prison warden.
i couldn't speculate on the
motives of global corporations.
anyway, isn't milland aerospace
the largest contributor
to your charity group?
but one thing doesn't have
to do with the other.
right?
sure it doesn't.
we're going to put
on a little show.
you'll get to meet a couple of convicts and
have a scary story to tell your friends.
and let's just hope
that when you sign
off on this place,
we can all get back to making
the world a better place.
after you, ma'am.
this is general population.
<i>all employees in sector
jesus.
pretty impressive?
- yes, it is.
- now,
we've prepared an
interview room for you.
we're going to need to
have a look at that room.
well, that's fine.
one thing, on the prisoners'
side of the room,
we don't allow weapons.
thank you.
thanks.
- okay?
- yeah, all set.
there you are.
yeah. i thought i could
smell you coming.
i'm here to tell you
the good news, snow.
you're finally getting spayed?
congratulations.
you've been convicted.
first degree murder
and conspiracy to commit espionage
against the united states.
that's the setup. do you
want to hear the punch line?
yeah, i'm dying to.
m.s. one. 30-year stasis.
no parole. effective
immediately.
and nothing about a constitutional
right to a fair hearing?
i think you waived that right
when you shot armstrong.
yeah, of course. i forgot
that part. i'm sorry.
you know what they say
about being put under?
that some minds
just can't take it.
i'm looking forward to it.
sweet dreams.
i don't know about you,
but i can't drive home.
mr. hydell.
how are you feeling?
are you experiencing
any disorientation?
i can't see out of
that eye anymore.
and what happened to your
face, did you burn it?
yeah, it's a love bite.
- i see.
- yeah.
i'm going to ask you a few questions about
your experience and treatment here.
do you dream while you're under?
well, i'm gonna dream about you.
aren't i?
i'd appreciate it if you'd
take it seriously, though.
it's very serious. very serious.
so, it says here you were convicted
of aggravated physical assault.
no,
i'm innocent. that wasn't me.
that's a case of mistaken identity.
fifty-three counts?
i've a very familiar face.
it's not like your face.
you've a very kind face.
it's lovely. you're perfect, you
are. i bet you got a nice smile.
do a little smile for me.
oh, smile.
you've got a lovely smile!
easy.
- hock.
- answer the question.
stay out of this, please.
what's that smell in here?
calm down.
you're wearing
perfume, aren't you?
- mr. hydell. - answer
the question.
- hock! - you're a
filthy article, man.
you are a bad man!
what's wrong with you?
you wanna test me?
- sit down!
- hock!
- okay. you wanna test me?
- hock!
do you know what i was before i
was convicted of rape, cock?
- surprise me, shithead.
- hock! stop!
i was a pickpocket.
he's got a gun!
<i>m. s. one control, we are...</i>
sir? there seems to be a
fire alarm on m.s. one.
- hide.
- what?
- hide.
- what?
hide?
hello.
- where is she? - who?
who? what? what?
"who? who? what? what?" don't lie
to me, man. i'll eat your brain.
- i'm not lying to you, man.
- control room active.
stay there.
hairdo!
are you all right, man?
have i hurt your nose?
come here. get up, man.
come here.
sit down.
open them all up right now.
every single one.
no, i don't think
that's a good...
think? you should think?
okay. okay. okay.
- <i>okay, okay, okay, okay. get
it done.</i> - <i>canisters open.</i>
good. that's a good job, man.
<i>remember, safety is
our first priority.</i>
<i>it has been 364 days
since our last incident.</i>
<i>good work, team.</i>
- go! go! go!
- come on.
no.
damn.
hit the sleeping gas. hit it!
easy!
- get up. get up!
- no! no!
in less than an hour,
all these people,
including young
emilie warnock here,
will be the only thing
keeping us alive.
you don't mess with
your poker chips.
<i>m. s. one, this is l.o.p.d.
do you copy? over.</i>
what's going on?
company.
<i>smoke leakage on the starboard
hull, possibly halon.</i>
look who i found, man!
get off the door, man.
found you a proper egghead.
turn on the guns. here.
calm down.
there you go.
that's clever, isn't it?
okey-dokey.
leave it.
why leave it, man? come on.
i said, leave it.
<i>copy that.</i>
<i>keep all eyes open.
full recon mission.</i>
- <i>establish m. s. one status...</i>
- <i>moving out.</i>
serious.
sorry!
- <i>we're taking fire.
</i> - <i>they have opened fire.</i>
you think you're
running the show?
get this into your thick skull.
- you're not running the show.
- sorry.
- mr. president.
- everybody out.
now! get out!
sir, within the last hour,
there has been a
massive infraction
on supermax m.s. one.
- it's a takeover.
- oh, god.
emilie. is she...
she's fine, according
to her telemetry,
but the situation is critical.
we can have special forces up
there on site within six hours.
to do what exactly?
i just mean, what order do
we give, mr. president?
- what are you saying?
- i'm asking,
are we talking about
saving all the hostages?
or are we talking about saving
just one in particular?
now we can send in the marines,
but we have no real
idea of the whereabouts
of your daughter on board.
as soon as we launch this
large-scale offensive,
my guess is...
well, she's as
good as dead, sir.
or...
what?
we can send in one man.
one man with one
very specific order.
to get emilie warnock out.
who?
i'd rather castrate
myself with blunt rocks.
why don't you get
rupert to do it?
hey. how's it going?
this is the best
offer you'll get.
don't get me wrong.
it's a dream vacation.
i mean, i load up,
i go into space,
i get inside the
maximum-security nuthouse,
save the president's daughter
if she's not dead already,
get past all the psychos
who've just woken up.
i'm thrilled that you
would think of me.
see you in 30 years.
wait.
snow, you should really
think about this.
because it could
benefit all of us.
okay, i'm joking. i'll do it.
frank's lighter.
here, put this on.
<i>please proceed to the
shuttle immediately.</i>
<i>lm23, you are clear
for takeoff.</i>
so, how many prisoners exactly?
mainly rapists and murderers.
you'll fit right in.
how do we know she's
not dead already?
she's wearing a telemetry
medical transmitter.
all the first family have them.
- nice to live in the big white
house? - so we know she's alive.
and she has had some blood loss, but
it's nothing life-threatening. so far.
so, if i actually find
her and she is alive,
how do we get off the ship?
easy. hitch a ride, man.
there's an escape
pod on level five.
it's not on any of
the schematics,
but you can find it on this map.
it'll guide you to the pod
and give you the access code.
the pod will take the two
of you off m.s. one.
is that clear?
yeah, clear as mud.
- here.
- what's that for?
climbing down off sidewalks?
no, no, no.
it's explosives. you join those two
ends, you got a nine-second charge.
it's grade two, for opening heavy
secure panels or bulkheads.
bulkheads?
- i gotta get out of here.
- that's enough!
i gotta get out of here.
that's okay.
you go to sleep now.
anyone else?
i'm gonna need a doctor
to get this stitched up.
thank you.
hey, lab coat.
you, move! doc, let's go.
- hey, wait, she's not a doctor.
- easy there, tough guy. easy.
- okay. - let's go. get your
ass up. - get your ass up.
stitch it up.
hey, wait a second. what
the hell is going on here?
we're taking over.
and who are you?
secret service.
i didn't hear
anything about this.
that will be why they
call it secret, right?
what's happening?
they demanded a negotiator.
he's prepping now. they've
been leaving a live feed open.
this is special
agent scott langral
and i'm in charge
of this situation.
<i>in charge?</i>
<i>that's where you're
very much mistaken.</i>
so there she is. right
in the hornet's nest.
let me know when you've
picked up on it, won't you?
when i want your opinion,
i'm gonna give it to you.
okay.
hey.
picked up on what?
oh, nothing. you know,
just that they don't know they've got
the president's daughter, that's all.
so,
- do you like working in space?
- yeah, i like it.
- you do? do you get dizzy?
- yeah, sometimes.
sometimes? yeah, i would.
hey, snow. how do you
figure that out?
far be it from me to teach
you how to suck eggs,
but you'd think they might
have said something.
and they've got her playing
doctor. i'm just saying.
<i>ladies and gentlemen, can
i have your attention?</i>
<i>we've prepared a
little demonstration.</i>
barnes? hello, barnes?
gotta make sure, man.
let me find...
listen, if you're gonna shit yourself, now
would be the perfect time, wouldn't it?
go on, boys.
no. no!
here we go.
reality tv.
- no! no!
- oh, no!
no, no, no, no.
- i can help you!
- can you help me?
- i can help you! - you're
gonna need the help, boyo.
it's a bit chilly
out there tonight.
don't do this.
don't do this. wait! wait!
i can help you!
wait!
bye-bye, barnes.
bye-bye, barnes.
no, i can help. wait! the girl!
what about her?
the girl! the girl!
- she's the president's...
- yep.
man! did you see the
look on his face?
he was about to say something.
he was about to say
something like...
okay.
<i>the clock is reset.</i>
<i>one hour and counting
until the next show,</i>
<i>so i'd get my skates
on if i were you.</i>
hey, tell me you are not still thinking
of negotiating with these psychos.
this is all over the
news in six hours.
then they're going
to know who she is.
we should just
stick to the plan.
the plan? you can send
your boy in if you want.
i'm just doing what's best
for the situation right now.
right?
thank you.
- i'm happy not to go.
- you're going.
- okay.
- go now.
all right.
hey, easy, easy, big guy.
it's all right. it's okay.
it's okay, easy.
things you asked for
are on the way.
is everybody okay?
for the time being, sure.
we're doing our bit. i was wondering,
what are you going to do for us?
don't tell me, you're
looking for a hostage.
that certainly would
be a good start.
hey, four eyes.
ain't no one leaving, man.
no. you hear me? no.
can i talk to you
privately for a minute?
if this works i'll wear a
tutu and pink pantyhose.
<i>snow, let's be ready, okay?</i>
<i>okay.</i>
this thing is
contained right now.
but you keep blasting
people out the airlock,
the press gets involved and all bets
are off and nobody goes anywhere.
now, you look like a smart guy, so i'm
gonna let you in on a little secret.
they're going to let you go.
but you really think they're
gonna let 500 convicts go?
you, maybe five or six
others, can get out of here.
it's what we call breakage.
why should i give up a hostage?
you know why they really ask
for a hostage, don%you?
<i>because it tells them one important
thing. this guy is in charge here.</i>
maybe you're not the guy who
makes decisions around here.
don't go there.
<i>i'm definitely the man you
should be talking to.</i>
okay, all right. show me
you're in charge then.
give me a hostage.
- can i trust you?
- you can trust me.
let's hold on.
this stuffed shirt may
well pull this off.
<i>jesus! coming, going.
make up your minds.</i>
- one hostage?
- one.
- who do you want? - whoever.
usually one of the wounded,
or, i don't know, maybe a woman.
a wounded woman's
always popular.
okay, we got eight principals,
four low-vel riot shotguns,
three berettas, low-vel semis.
you choose.
up. get up.
- why me?
- get up.
honey, you'll be fine.
looks like my plan is working.
sorry.
what's going on here?
not her. not her. no,
no, no, no. not her.
a decision's been made.
please, man. not her. not that
one, no. pick another one.
crawl back under your stone.
don't say that.
this woman needs medical
assistance. come on.
i didn't realize. i forget. i just let
myself run away with myself, you know.
you want a wounded hostage?
- no!
- back off.
go see to your friends, cock.
no.
you wanted a wounded hostage and
now you have one, don't you?
everybody's happy.
everybody wins.
- you're happy. yeah?
- kathryn, it's gonna be okay.
snow, it's gone bad.
<i>you gotta get in there, man.
get in there.</i>
kathryn, we're gonna
get you home, okay?
kathryn.
<i>it's a setup. there's some guy
outside climbing on board.</i>
kathryn, i just need you
to breathe with me.
listen, i was just doing
what i was supposed...
kathryn.
kathryn, look at me.
i really... i... please...
you said i could trust you.
listen, i was just gonna...
please.
<i>bring them back inside.</i>
come on, emilie, let's go.
come on now.
do something useful.
go find that man and kill him.
i don't wanna see
you till it's done.
why don't we just
kill that lunatic?
because he's my brother.
okay. hold on, nearly there.
okay, got it.
you need to look around and
you should see a sealed port.
- <i>you got it?
</i> - <i>yeah, i see it.</i>
<i>okay. i need you to pull back
on the small quick release.</i>
<i>right.</i>
<i>are you in?</i>
<i>snow.</i>
snow?
snow, can you hear me?
warnock?
there you are.
come on.
wait, wait, wait. this way.
we'll be safe here. nothing
getting through that.
- so what now?
- we wait.
they're sending the marines.
it won't be long.
snow, what's going on?
you know, global warming,
<i>some celebrity is
getting a boob-job,</i>
congress is screwing
the pooch again.
- you know, same old.
- snow.
come on, man. i mean,
what's going on there?
oh, yeah. well,
<i>your wildcat smacked me in the
head with a fire extinguisher</i>
<i>and locked herself
in some room.</i>
so she's safe. send the cavalry.
listen, snow. you stick to the
plan. you better do your job
<i>or i'll hit you with a
sherman tank. got that?</i>
a sherman tank? yeah, right.
toss my caber, langral.
- i've got other things to do.
- hey, snow...
the answer to all our problems
lies behind this door.
get me a security engineer.
actually,
bring me two.
snow, can you hear me?
<i>snow.</i>
<i>come on, snow.</i>
snow, can you hear me?
it's langral.
<i>i want you to go in and get her.
now.</i>
actually, that's a little
inconvenient right now.
<i>i don't care.</i>
she's losing oxygen.
she's suffocating.
<i>you understand?</i>
- you're making this up, right?
- <i>snow, it's harry here.</i>
this is for real. at the current
rate of nitrogen buildup,
she will be dead in... how long?
five minutes, man.
yeah. well, contrary
to popular belief,
i'm not actually houdini and those
things are designed to be impregnable.
so, i'm not sure what
you're asking me to do.
you all right?
yeah.
no.
hopefully, this will short-circuit me the
inevitable "it can't be done" discussion.
i need this door open.
<i>you should see a ladder in
front of you. do you see it?</i>
yeah.
okay, i need you to take it.
<i>and then, when you're over,
you gotta go straight ahead.</i>
<i>and here's where it gets
a little bit tricky.</i>
<i>i need you to get to the
other side. correct?</i>
what do you want me to do, fly?
'cause i think i left
my cape at home.
i need you to listen
to this, buddy. go.
the gravity generated by the
torsion system will hold you up.
<i>you gotta trust me on this. you
should just glide right over.</i>
really?
<i>snow?</i>
<i>snow!</i>
<i>snow, there is no time
for hanging around.</i>
what is that?
all channels.
snow, can you hear me?
reactivate the torsion.
what is that?
- they're trying to get it
open. - can they do that?
this may take a bit longer.
that really is unfortunate.
we're gonna need a new engineer.
this one's sprung a leak.
<i>okay, so that was easy, right?</i>
<i>are you at the hatch? snow?</i>
your two minutes start now.
shoot me if you want, but i can guarantee
this open if you give me five minutes.
good sales pitch.
<i>oxygen levels depleted.</i>
oh, god, no.
<i>please seek medical
assistance.</i>
<i>please seek medical
assistance.</i>
okay, emilie, listen
to me very carefully.
nitrogen is lighter than oxygen, so
there will be more at floor level.
breathe shallow but steady.
keep your heart rate low.
i'm sorry.
something happened. somehow
she found more oxygen,
but that will only give
us a minute or so.
<i>snow, you gotta get in there.</i>
<i>eeg activity declining.
brain death in 20 seconds.</i>
- twenty seconds.
- lost him.
twenty seconds and
then this is all over.
yeah. i should've
stayed in college.
okay.
hot girl on the floor,
big hole in her leg.
okay, first let's get
the motor going.
<i>open the medi-pack. you
need to get the defib kit.</i>
fifteen seconds.
you know the counting thing?
it's not very relaxing.
gel them, place them on the chest,
center under the right arm.
- make sure they stay on her.
- ten seconds.
and...
bingo! got an induced-pulse.
<i>seven, six...</i>
- so why is there still
counting? - not done yet.
<i>find the vidadermic
labeled "20 ccs."</i>
- serotonin nor epinephrine.
- what the hell do i do with this?
<i>it's a neurotransmitter
stimulant.</i>
you've got to push the needle through the
center of her right eye into the brain.
come on, you're
kidding me, right?
move it around until it
locates the thalamus.
<i>it's self-guiding.
then fire it.</i>
okay.
i'm gonna be sick.
<i>okay. we've got some activity.</i>
yeah, we've got activity all right.
she's doing the lambada in here.
- <i>get some air in there.</i>
- <i>what, mouth to mouth?</i>
<i>mouth to mouth.</i>
here we go.
hey!
it's okay, it's okay.
- what the hell are you doing? - i'm
bringing you back from the dead.
- i was dead? - yeah, and so far
i think i prefer you that way.
come on, that's enough foreplay.
we gotta get out of here.
you! let's go. come on.
back to the kennel!
shit.
watch your head.
take the next left.
okay, this way.
<i>then go about 50 feet.</i>
<i>but watch your back, man.
remember kiev.</i>
hold it, her bp is dropping.
<i>she's losing too much blood.</i>
<i>hey, snow, docs say
check emilie's leg.</i>
yeah. i'll put it
on the to-do list.
you're almost there, buddy.
i understand you're the
prison's communications expert.
i've a job for you.
bollocks.
<i>now it is vitally important
that you go the right way.</i>
<i>whatever you do, for christ's
sake, don't go down the...</i>
harry? harry.
hey, snow. can you hear me?
shit!
they've cut transmission.
who did?
the little transmission fairies.
who do you think?
greg, what the hell
is happening here?
- this way.
- are you sure?
- yeah. - you
don't sound sure.
well, lam.
it's electromagnetic lockout.
christ.
find a way to get me back in
because we're flying blind here.
i thought you said
you were sure.
you're really a lot of
fun, you know that?
come on, don't worry.
it's perfectly safe.
you don't have to do that!
a simple "thank you" is enough.
asshole.
so,
well, we lost them, huh?
right.
sorry.
up you get.
thank you.
yuck.
who are you?
who sent you?
your old man did.
my dad.
what did he say?
well, i didn't get to meet him personally.
he kind of delegated your rescue.
he had a big conference
on the corn surplus.
you're kidding me?
no. no, apparently, we should
all be eating more corn.
about my father.
oh, yeah, i made
that other bit up.
- did he have a message for me?
- yes, you are adopted.
are you the only type of jerk they
found for this kind of mission?
the only one stupid
enough to say yes.
so, what's the plan?
surely you have a plan
to rescue the hostages?
- what hostages? - the hostages.
the staff, the guards.
should i write it out in crayon?
i came here to rescue you
and mission accomplished.
and quite well, i might add.
are you just thrilled being yourself
all day or is it a part-time job?
i'm not kidding. we
can't just leave them.
- leave who?
- the hostages!
- what is that? - that's
to stop the bleeding.
and hopefully, the talking.
they will die if we leave them.
listen, we're not going back
to rescue any hostages, okay?
we're getting out of here,
after i do one thing.
there. that's the plan.
are you always this obnoxious?
did you hear something?
no, i'm just enjoying
the silence.
you asshole.
we are not leaving them.
listen, it's really
very sweet of you,
but there's not a lot of
room for anybody else, okay?
it's kind of a vip deal, get it?
what i get is, you're
a selfish dick...
that'll freeze the nerves
in this spot for 24 hours.
you want some on your mouth?
no?
- okay, see here on the map?
- yeah.
that's where the pod is.
you get in it,
you fly away and the good guys
will come and get you. okay?
on my own?
you're a big girl, right?
here's an apple. and a gun.
don't talk to strangers.
shoot them.
this is the plan you
agreed on with my father?
yeah, he said it'll toughen you
up. apparently, you need that.
well, i'm sure i'll be
fine. where are you going?
i've got a hot date.
it's been a real slice, so good luck.
and good luck with the leg thing.
okay.
okay, the map.
you gotta flip it.
it's upside down.
no, no. so you can
see the screen.
which way's north?
okay, we're in space now. so it's
not north, it's port and starboard.
thanks.
you're doing great.
<i>can i have your attention?</i>
<i>you want to get out of here?
our meal ticket is a woman.</i>
<i>and she's been on the
run for some time now.</i>
<i>we need her alive</i>
<i>and we need her as
soon as possible.</i>
<i>now, they're going to try
and leave the station.</i>
<i>watch everywhere.</i>
yeah, okay, you can tag
along, but maybe don't talk.
just keep it zipped.
here, give me the map.
okay, we go this way.
north.
<i>smiler!</i>
<i>are you there?</i>
<i>sweetheart, i miss you.
smiler!</i>
hey, why do they do that?
do what?
the marking on the face.
other prisoners do it to them.
lets everyone know you're a rat.
here, put these on.
- no. - they don't
come in pink.
you can't walk past 500 whack
jobs dressed like a chick.
oh, so this is
part of your plan.
so kind of you to clue me in.
you can't smoke in here.
all evidence to the contrary.
so...
so, what do i call you?
you know what? don't call me.
- what's your name?
- snow.
- snow?
- yeah.
or sir. you can decide.
what's your first name?
snow.
your name is snow snow?
well, that's just ridiculous.
- why won't you tell me
your name? - i just did.
no, you didn't.
what is that?
engine oil, coffee, some water
i just got out of the toilet.
and just what do you
plan on doing with it?
i plan on putting
it in your hair.
if you would like to play witness
protection and shampoo in toilet water,
be my guest. not me.
come on. it'll be fun.
not on your life.
god, stop!
it stinks!
- enough!
- there you go.
wasn't that fun?
- you're a pig.
- thank you.
you always treat women this way?
always. well, only
if i like them.
you have any idea what my
father would do to you?
jeez! not raise taxes again?
here.
yeah, you look good.
though, something's missing.
what?
it's okay, it's okay. it's only cosmetic.
it's only cosmetic. it's nothing personal.
here, look, look. it'll
probably save your life.
you look tough now, see?
you really are a naughty
boy, special agent.
<i>what, you thought we
wouldn't find out?</i>
don't know what
you're talking about.
you tell warnock that
we have his daughter.
<i>and unless we get
what we want,</i>
you tell your boss that i've
got 500 pent-up convicts
<i>all too eager to educate
his little girl.</i>
okay.
what do you want?
what's happened?
is emilie okay?
what's going on here, man?
what's it look like? we're
going on a hunting trip.
you're going to get her?
i mean, let me come.
- no. - don't leave
me behind, man.
what am i gonna do here?
nothing.
and don't do anything stupid
when i'm gone. all right?
okay. this is main containment, so
don't draw attention to yourself.
and what if this doesn't work?
well, then we're
probably gonna die.
is that your idea
of encouragement?
what can i say? i'm sorry it's not one of
your fancy presidential society functions.
where do you get these
ideas about me?
i don't know. you know, you just don't seem
like the kind of girl who'd go bowling.
excuse me? bowling? i happen
to be great at bowling.
really? you go bowling?
yeah. every tuesday. there's
a lane at the white house.
yeah. that's what
i'm talking about.
that is hardly my fault.
careful, you're starting to
sound like your old man.
here. not even loaded.
dude, you're a dude, okay?
hey, you! yeah, you.
you know who we're talking to.
what are you looking for?
mace.
like the spray?
no, not like the spray.
mace!
shit!
can i help you?
no. well, you could
get out of the way.
no problem.
just give me the password.
yeah.
i like your pretty boy buddy.
does he like to party?
yeah. like it's 1999.
don't you?
you don't know the password.
then there's a penalty.
get them!
the door's jammed!
here, shoot them, will you?
jesus, i thought you
were a democrat.
mace! come on.
mace! you son of a bitch.
you okay?
okay. okay.
bitch, son of a bitch.
what the hell's wrong
with you, buddy?
buddy? buddy, you.
buddy, you be. no.
no. not to be. no. wrong!
what's going on, man?
i know what this is.
it's dementia.
come on, he's like 35.
it's from the stasis.
some people just unravel.
gravel.
- so, it is true. - true,
true, true, true.
true blue. union stew.
to do or not to do. right?
no, wrong.
wrong. lullaby, lullaby,
lullaby, lullaby...
shit.
i need you to get me something.
now you're asking a crazy man
where he hid a briefcase
that you threw away in a
crowded subway station?
mace? remember the case?
the package?
in the train station. i threw
it to you on the train.
where'd you put it?
right.
yeah, no, i put it...
yeah?
in my pants.
- in your pants? - yeah.
sister mary said it was bad
to take it out in church in
front of the other kids.
when you do bad things, the angels,
they cry. that's what sister mary says.
it's a disruption in his cortical
circuitry. it's why i'm here.
it's just bad news.
that's what it is.
come on, buddy. let's go.
wait a minute. why are
you bringing him?
- he's one of them. he's safer
without us. - i need him.
for what? this
phantom briefcase?
you'd be lucky to get a recipe
for mud pies out of this guy.
he's coming with us, okay?
end of story.
i know exactly what i'm doing.
don't let them get away!
come on. god damn it!
get them! over here!
okay, this way! this way!
come on.
- put a light down there.
- gotta go.
go, go:
gotta go!
- go, go.
- go, go. okay. go.
porn horn.
okay, come on.
man.
- oh, god! - come on, mace!
mace!
hit the panic button!
- come on, buddy. hit the panic
button. - button, button. mutton.
the button. hit
the panic button.
- hit the panic button,
mace. come on! - button.
son of a bitch.

son of a bitch.
shit! hold on, buddy.
wait there!
oh, dear. locked.
lock. locker. locker.

mace, case.
i foresee you.
- i see you.
- what?
i see you.
i foresee you. lullaby.
- i foresee you. - hold
on, buddy. come on.
come on.
god damn it!
if you want something done...
we need a change of
plan 'round here.
well, that's that then.
i'm sorry.
yeah, right. i'm sure you are.
i know he was your friend.
i don't need your sympathy,
okay? neither does he.
no.
no, he needed a friend who
wouldn't hang him out to dry.
yeah, i'm taking the rap for something i
didn't do, okay? i didn't put him here.
who cares? people die all
the time. it's no big deal.
how many people have died
for you since you got here?
but you're the president's daughter,
so you're worth it, right?
looks like your little pr
trip got all screwed up.
i came here to ensure that people were being
treated fairly and decently, unlike yourself.
you know, it's easy to be a
saint with nothing on the line.
you wait till you've got a
serious sacrifice to make
and then you'll find out
who you really are.
most people run for cover.
but not you, right?
- no.
- no.
you just sacrifice your friends.
<i>sorry, hold on.</i>
you're saying that the international
space station ran into m.s. one?
no, i'm saying the opposite.
m.s. one ran into the
international space station.
i thought it was
locked in orbit.
it was controlled by a
geo-orbital technician.
and where is this technician?
they blew him out an airlock.
look, m.s. one is essentially
a big fly-by-wire system.
without constant monitoring, it's
basically falling out of the sky.
what's the bottom line?
- best guess?
- please.
impact with the eastern
seaboard in eight hours.
can you get me a secure line
to jack tallis at justice?
bingo.
it's a rescue mission!
that's not a rescue mission.
come on.
i thought you said
there were two seats.
no, two pods! you take this one
and i'll jump in the other one.
- where's the other one? - we
don't have time for this, okay?
just get in.
- you are going in the other pod, right?
- i'll be right behind you, don't worry.
promise me.
yeah, okay, i promise.
what is your first name?
i'll tell you when we get there.
i'll race you down.
i'll buy you an ice cream.
sir? we have pod launch on m.s.
one.
what do you know! your
deadbeat friend did it.
this your idea of
keeping a promise?
what the hell is wrong with you?
why'd you get out of the pod?
i realized i might be the only
thing keeping the hostages alive.
really? how do you figure that?
my father won't authorize an
attack with me still here.
have you actually
met your father?
- don't start that. we have to
help them. - look, i can't, okay?
i would love to, but i can't.
mace told me where the case is.
- bullshit. - it was the
last thing he said.
really?
so where is it?
you help me, i help you.
come on!
or are you all
mouth, no trousers?
fine. you'll believe
what you want.
i wasn't going to tell you, but your
standards of sainthood crap won me over.
okay, wait. wait.
i'm a lot of trousers, okay?
<i>smiler!</i>
there's been a change of plan.
<i>we're going to have a
sing-song instead. okay?</i>
<i>all right, then.</i>
<i>come back to me.</i>
<i>my sweet, my little emilie</i>
god.
i've not told you the plan, man.
i didn't tell you the plan.
<i>for every three seconds you're
not here, i'm gonna kill a man.</i>
<i>do you understand me now?</i>
<i>so...</i>
<i>come back to me, my
sweet, my little emilie.</i>
<i>where have you gone?</i>
- <i>stop!</i> - <i>tell
me where you are</i>
<i>or i kill another one.</i>
- please stop!
- emilie.
<i>hello, sweetheart. i can
hear you're upset there.</i>
<i>i'm bloody upset as well. i'm
sweating like a pig here.</i>
just stop. i'll do
anything you want.
<i>well, now, you're being silly.</i>
<i>i think you're being silly now.
let me come and get you.</i>
<i>tell me where you are
and don't lie. ever.</i>
emilie, don't.
stop killing people.
<i>you tell me the truth now and i'll
stop shooting your friends. okay?</i>
level three.
<i>thank you.</i>
no! god!
no!
is anybody hiding?
'cause i'll find you!
<i>it's left.</i>
he was gonna kill
them all anyway.
i don't really know
where the case is.
i just needed you to help me.
okay.
yeah.
this is what i was afraid of.
they've been using the
prisoners as guinea pigs.
yeah, looks like your hostage buddies
are not exactly the innocent victims
you thought they were, huh?
liars everywhere
these days it seems.
don't move.
god, i hate that.
hello, you two.
do you know what you've done?
turn on the comms.
sir, comms are live.
all channels.
snowfall? this is home fire.
<i>come in.</i>
<i>snowfall, this is home fire.</i>
<i>come in.</i>
can we make this a
secure channel, please?
- snow? snow, are you there?
- harry, is that you?
yeah, man. live and direct.
for one night only. you?
yeah. put me on the guest list.
<i>did we manage to make
contact with our friend?</i>
affirmative.
and what about the
thing that you lost?
- did our friend come through
for us? - negative, harry.
okay, don't sweat it. look, things
have kind of gone sideways here.
- <i>you gotta get out.</i> - <i>i
didn't get the girl.</i>
- <i>ain't that the story
of your life?</i> - <i>yeah.</i>
<i>from what i'm reading on her
vitals here, it don't look good.</i>
there's no way for you to get back to
her even if she's not already dead.
<i>m. s. one is falling out of the
sky, snow. you gotta get out.</i>
- <i>okay.</i>
- <i>get to dock 9.</i>
<i>there's an oram
engineering suit there.</i>
<i>put it on and get outside.</i>
you'll need to float
around a bit,
but i'm sending someone
by to pick you up. okay?
i think i'm just gonna
lie here for a while,
- <i>and see if it all goes away.</i>
- <i>no.</i>
all right.
the m.s. one is destabilized.
<i>let us on board, or we'll
be forced to attack.</i>
now. you want to save your skin?
tell your daddy to
call off the assault.
or i will set my
brother onto you.
<i>dad?</i>
<i>emilie, i'm here.</i>
<i>emilie?</i>
are you okay?
<i>can you hear me?</i>
<i>sweetheart?</i>
everyone's dead.
blow this dump out of the sky.
well, shit.
you get them back.
you hear me? you call them off!
promises are promises, smiler!
so be it.
promises, sweetheart.
leave her be.
that's it, then.
sir,
you need to authorize
an assault.
emilie's still on the station.
i know this might be difficult,
sir, but she's just one hostage.
she is my daughter.
i know that, sir.
then you know that i
cannot authorize that.
then i'm sorry, jeff.
sorry?
under section 4 of
the 25th amendment,
i am temporarily relieving you of
all your duties as the president
of the united states due to the
fact that you are incapable
of placing national security
above personal concerns.
you can't do that. you need vice-presidential
and congressional approval.
already signed.
you son of a bitch!
thank you, sir.
scott! please.
don't do this.
you'll kill her.
go. full breach.

oh, shit!
you said that was
your promise to me!
quiet, we can salvage this.
shut up for a second!
- you said that was a promise
to me, man. - not now.
you choose him over me.
you leave me behind.
we've a serious problem and
you're shouting about this?
you made me look stupid.
every time i dig us out...
mommy said you speak too much.
who's gonna look after you now?
families!
hey, now then, where
were we, smiler?
<i>target will be

i really hate heights.
emilie!
emilie!
emilie. come on. emilie.
come on, buddy. get up!
- okay.
- let's go.
the briefcase. the
train station.
i threw you the case.
where'd you put it?
<i>where'd you put it? mace?
you remember the package?</i>
<i>in the train station.</i>
<i>true blue, union... union...</i>
<i>true blue, union... no.</i>
<i>true blue. union stew.</i>
some people just unravel.
<i>now you're asking a crazy man
where he hid a briefcase.</i>
<i>green. beans.</i>
- <i>mace?</i> - lock,
lockers, locker.
<i>green. green gloppy,
stocker, stocker.</i>
- mace. mace.
- yeah.
<i>remember the case?</i>
<i>where'd you put it? i threw
it to you on the train.</i>
case.
- <i>where'd you put it?</i>
- <i>green.</i>
<i>well, locked, clock.</i>
lullaby, lullaby, lullaby.
<i>green, gloppy, lullaby)'.</i>
<i>what briefcase?</i>
i see you.
i see you.
i foresee you.
<i>i foresee you.</i>
<i>i see you.</i>
<i>i foresee you.</i>
<i>what happened in that room?</i>
what happened in that room?
- that's not what happened.
- i saw it with my own eyes.
<i>running out of jokes, are we?</i>
<i>that's not what happened.</i>
<i>i saw it with my own eyes.</i>
there's something
that we need to do.
- thanks, charlie.
- hey, buddy.
how you doing?
i'm good.
how's the girl?
as far as they'll tell me she's
fine. you did a good job.
sorry about mace.
and that you didn't get
the thing you needed.
no, no, i got it.
no, i mean the briefcase.
yeah. yeah, i got the briefcase.
- you got the briefcase?
- yeah.
- i thought that you...
- no, it's here.
- the case is here? - yeah.
you want to see it?
- yeah. - charlie?
can you grab it?
you know frank was undercover
when he was killed, right?
he wasn't selling secrets.
he was returning them.
yeah.
i don't understand.
what i don't understand is how
you knew the combination.
that's what i don't understand.
right.
well...
well, this is awkward.
- they pay you well?
- matter of fact, they did.
no, they really did.
how much was that exactly? how
much was frank's life worth?
does the number
even matter, snow?
i hope they put you
away for a long time.
you know, i don't
think they will.
you of all people know that they like to keep
all these kind of things on the down-low.
my guess, i'll do three years
tops at minimum security,
and you want to know why?
because they need
people like me.
i know all of their dirty little
secrets. ain't that right?
i am sorry about frank,
but in the big scheme of things,
he'll go down as an innocent bystander.
he won't even make the balance sheet.
just like you. because
he's a relic.
i mean, god, look at you.
nobody smokes anymore, snow!
you know, for all your
bluster and your bullshit,
you're nothing but
cannon-fodder.
you're cannon-fodder and
they don't need you
like they need me, okay?
<i>ignem feram.</i>
that was from frank.
so,
all this trouble for
an empty briefcase.
don't let it keep you up
at night. thanks, charlie.
hey, snow!
good job.
take this,
don't let them take this.
frank.
what's it gonna be, buddy?
i know something about you.
amazing what you can find out as first
daughter in old army documents.
last name, snow.
first name,
marion.
my old man was a big
john wayne fan.
must have been tough
on the playground.
that's why i'm so lovable.
looks like you're a free man.
thanks to you.
what kind of robin
hood would i be
if i didn't stop to rescue
maid marion once in a while?
okay, you can stop that.
snow's just fine.
no, i'm getting used to marion.
i really like it.
makes me see your feminine side.
- great. - i've got
something for you.
what the hell was that for?
i owed you that.
i really feel we need to continue
this on an equitable basis.
you know, for a minute there, i
thought you were going to kiss me.
where's the entourage?
gave them the slip.
- have you to thank for
teaching me that. - nice work.
you're still bleeding, marion.
and you wonder why i didn't
tell you my first name?
all right, how about "sally"?
it has a nice ring to it.
yes, it does, but i prefer snow.
i can't call you that. it
sounds like an ice cream.
speaking of which, i
believe you owe me one.
you know, i've got this feeling your old
man's not going to approve of this.
i mean, i can't really see
this going anywhere, can you?
depends on how good
