of being badass motherfuckers.

i really thought this job would have
more car chases and explosions,
and less homeless people
doo-dooing everywhere.

this is a police matter?
to get your frisbee back?
get your own fucking frisbee.

- don't. stop it.
don't. you did it. you fed the ducks.
you feel like a big shot?
no fucking way.
one percenters?
these guys are, like, big-time drug dealers.
if we could take them down as our first bust,
we'd be off park duty for sure.

you want to beat my dick off?
i'll beat your dick off with both hands.
what's up'? let's go.

he's going to punch you so many times
around the genital area
that your dick's just going to fall off.

- that's actual drugs.
- oh, my god.

- what up, park?
- what's up? what's up'?
- what up, park? who wants one?
congratulations on the bust, boys.
it sounds great.
- thank you, cinnamon.
- are those new?
the department was forced
to drop the charges
because you forgot to read him
his miranda rights.
what possible reason is there
for not doing the only thing
you have to do when arresting someone?
i did read him his right...
i did a version of that.
- do you even know the miranda rights?
- yes.
let's hear them, then.
you got a lot of stuff to do.
no, go ahead.
you going anywhere, schmidt?
we got time.
i had a thing, but i can probably push it back.
go ahead. it's four declamatory sentences,
followed by a question,
for a total of 57 words.
okay. look, it obviously starts with,
"you have the right to remain silent."
i know you've heard this before. and then,
i think it sounds something like...
-"you have the right to an attorney."
- well, the thing... yeah, right.
"you have the right to remain an attorney."
did you say
that you have the right to be an attorney?
you do have the right to be an attorney,
if you want to.
where were you?
i was chasing my perp, sir.
and how did that go for you?
honestly, he did get away,
and he threw me down pretty hard.
actually fucked up my elbow pretty bad.
can i see that?
yeah, actually, it hurts
'cause the dirt gets mushed into it.
wow.
fortunately for you two,
we're reviving a canceled
undercover police program from the '80s
and revamping it for modern times.
you see, the guys in charge of this stuff
lack creativity
and are completely out of ideas,
so all they do now
is recycle shit from the past
and expect us all not to notice.
one of these programs
involves the use of young,
immature-seeming officers.
sir, are you saying
that you're going to send us into, like,
a child sex slavery ring or something?
sir, if i have to suck somebody's dick, i will.
it's just... i'd prefer not to.
i think you idiots are perfect.
you're officially transferred.
- all right. yeah.
- that's great.
where should we report to?
down on jump street.
no, that doesn't sound right.
is it...
this has got to be a joke.
this is it.
aroma of christ church?
how's it going?
this place is weird.
everybody comfortable?
yeah.
get your motherfucking ass up
when i'm talking!
you will be going undercover
as high school students.
you are here simply because you look young.
you some justin beaver,
miley cyrus-looking motherfuckers.
captain sassy.
i know what you're thinking,
"angry black captain."
it ain't nothing but a stupid stereotype.
well, guess what, motherfuckers.
i'm black.
and i worked my ass off to be the captain!
and sometimes i get angry.
so suck a dick!
what i'm trying to show you is,
embrace your stereotypes.
like this guy right here. handsome.
and he's probably a dummy.
and then this guy.
he's short and insecure.
and he's probably good with money.
- you are good with money.
- what the fuck?
didn't somebody tell you guys
this was an undercover unit?
i don't... i actually didn't...
i didn't get a letter or anything.
- yeah, like, a start time...
- with a dress code or anything like that.
teenage the fuck up!
rule number one at jump street. fugazy.
do not get expelled.
nobody in the system knows you're here.
all right? nobody.
you get kicked out of school,
your monkey ass is getting kicked out
of jump street.
rule number two. burns.
do not have sexual relations
with students or teachers, sir.
you hear that? that's you.
- don't do it, man.
- why...
- keep that dirty dick in your pants.
- dirty?
don't fuck no students.
don't fuck no teachers.
sir, i know we come off
<i>as</i> a couple of lady-killers,
but i promise you
we will be super professional on the job.
clearly, i wasn't talking to you, big titties.
you cherub-looking motherfucker.
i was talking to your partner over here.
fake-ass handsome mcgee.
when i'm talking to him, i'm talking to him.
when i say, "shut the fuck up,"
- i'm talking to you.
- cool.
now, you two sons of bitches,
in my office now.
right now!
<i>hi. i am billiam willingham.</i>
<i>so i bought these,</i>
<i>which is all anybody seems
to be talking about right now.</i>
<i>cheers.</i>
it's a new synthetic drug.
goes by the street name h.f.s.
<i>holy fucking shit.</i>
<i>holy...</i>
they put this on the internet
for everybody to see?
they're teenagers, man.
they're really stupid.
so you should blend right in.
<i>jessica, will you go to prom with me?
but i already know the answer. it's yes.</i>
i could watch this kid all day.
man, this kid rules.
ruled.
his parents found him od'd
in his room a few days ago.
he's dead.
whatever he took,
the lab has never seen it before.
and <i>as</i> you can see, this kid is white.
that means people actually give a shit.
sir, i just want to throw out to you
that i would give a shit if he was black.
right now, h.f.s.
is contained right there at sagan high.
now, once this drug breaks containment,
it goes viral in a few days.
jenko, i looked at your old transcript.
i enrolled you in a bunch of bullshit courses
like photography and drama.
get in with the burnouts and the cool kids.
find out who's slinging this shit.
schmidt, <i>says</i> you were a virgin
-through high school.
- it <i>says</i> that?
no. i just assumed it,
due to your many years on the honor roll
and your membership to the juggling squad.
it's the juggling society,
but it's fine. it's fine.
they're stealing equipment
from the chemistry lab.
that's what we think
they're cooking the dope with.
i enrolled you into honors chemistry.
here's your new identities, all right?
brad and doug mcquaid.
the mission is this.
infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.
we get to be brothers?
infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.
but if we find the supplier first,
we don't have to worry about the dealers.
god damn.
infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.
hey, korean jesus.
i don't know if you only cater
to korean christians
or if you even exist. no offense.
i just...
i'm really freaked out
about going back to high school.
it was just so fucking hard the first time.
i know we haven't made our first arrest,
or maybe i'm not the best cop.
korean jesus,
i just really don't want to fuck this up.
i'm sorry for swearing so much.
the end?
i don't really know how to end a prayer.
the end?
yeah.
hey! hey!
stop fucking with korean jesus!
he ain't got time for your problems. he busy!
with korean shit.
- you two get to your mama house asap.
- what?
you're teenagers now, all right?
you two are staying
at schmidt's parents' house
for the duration of this assignment.
fuck me.
this house is adorable.
my baby's home! come here.
you will always be
my infant angel baby child.
there's my qw-
it's great to see you guys.
- hey.
- schmidt family! up top, papa schmidt.
oh, my god.
mama schmidt, did you do all this yourself?
- this is unbelievable.
- well, yeah.
- i guess i did.
- it's gorgeous!
so are you.
honey, listen, i want to tell you,
we did blow up the air mattress in your room
'cause we're kind of using that
<i>as</i> a workout area,
so i hope you don't mind the elliptical.
no, no! jenko, jenko, oh, my god, please.
no, no.
don't touch that.
we just brought it back from sedona.
guys, can we get rid of this stuff?
i mean, it looks like i died in a car crash
-and you guys haven't moved on.
- rid of it?
if we take it down,
we have to stop bragging about you.
i look like fred savage
from the wonder years,
but completely naked,
wearing indian friendship bracelets.
that is a great picture, morton.
you look like a young jay leno.
am i even wearing underwear in this picture?
no.
i remember. you know why?
because i've told it to a therapist
about 8,000 times.
i mean, this is a fourth grade
participation medal for soccer.
it's literally a medal for sucking.
- no, that is a medal for trying.
- yes.
let me tell you something.
this guy was always a great tryer.
that must be phyllis.
she is just dying to see you.
what? mom, you told phyllis i was here?
she's going to tell the whole neighborhood.
i told you, it's an undercover assignment.
it's super secretive.
"undercover." that's so cute.
- i'm going upstairs.
- okay, honey. i want you to know
-we are so glad you're here.
- okay.
that's great. thank you.
- all right. where is he?
- he's upstairs.
he just needs to take a little rest,
and then he's dying to see you, too.
- bye-bye.
- i baked muffins!
if you don't know your identity,
we're screwed tomorrow.
you got to study this stuff.
forget those identities. they're bullshit.
they said i was held back a year.
you were. you were held back two years.
just 'cause it's a fake backstory
doesn't mean it doesn't hurt my feelings.
fuck! socks don't match.
i got to start all over.
it's the first day of school, dude.
i got to look awesome.
you know, back in the day,
you were super popular,
and i wasn't as much.
we didn't really get along in high school.
you don't think that's going to happen again,
do you'?
no. come on, man. we're adults now.
we're best buds.
it's definitely not going to happen again.
- we're good.
- cool.
beautiful day out there, boys.
just shut up.
"anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.
"you have the right to an attorney.
"if you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed..."
dude, do you still not know
the miranda rights? you're a cop.
come on, man. they always cut away on tv
before they finish them.
all right, let's do it.
- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- what?
what are you doing?
- what? what are you talking about?
- are you two-strapping?
- my backpack? yeah.
- yeah, i got to be seen with you.
you got to one-strap it.
seriously, i would no-strap it
if that would even be possible.
okay, what makes you the expert?
i was cool in high school, and you weren't.
okay, that makes sense. continue.
the three keys of coolness in high school,
by jenko.
one, don't try hard at anything.
okay? two, make fun of people who do try.
three, be handsome.
four, if anyone steps to you
on the first day of school,
you punch them directly in the face.
five, drive a kick-ass car.
shit.
all right, but just don't be driving it
like teenagers,
revving up the engine and shit, okay?
we would never.
come on, hoffs. give us a little credit.
- hey' you ready?
- go! '
that was awesome! that was amazing.
- was i flying'?
- that was amazing.
all right, do mine, do mine.
- okay, ready? here i go.
- yeah, yeah.
you okay?
i think i shit my pants.
hey, park in that handicapped spot.
- it'll make us look cool.
- that's awesome.
dude?
- everybody's two-strapping it.
- just stay with the one-strap.
i can't. i can't. i can't right now.
what are you doing? what are you doing?
don't succumb to the peer pressure.
- what are you doing?
- you're supposed to use two straps.
- one strap is peer pressure.
- no. no. you're fucking up right now.
okay, those are goths.
those are nerds.
i don't know what they are.
what the fuck are those things?
i'm so confused right now.
whoa.
- hi.
- hey.
- hey.
- good morning.
hey, yo. hey-
- is that your car?
- yeah.
what's that thing get, 10 miles to the gallon?
no, try, like, seven.
- what about you?
- biodiesel, dawg.
smells like egg rolls.
yeah, it does.
runs on leftover fry oil from hunan palace.
but we try to ride bikes when we can.
global crisis and whatnot.
whatever, man. i don't care about anything.
you don't care about the environment?
that's kind of fucked up, man.
hey, hey, will y'all shut the hell up?
i'm trying to study. thanks.
look at him. he's trying.
he's actually trying. what a nerd.
look at the nerd. look at the nerd.
- look at him. look at the nerd.
- who you calling a nerd, man?
i'm sorry. what...
- shit!
- shit, dude.
are you okay, man'? hey, what the hell?
are you serious?
well, turn that gay-ass music off.
- you punched me because i'm gay?
- what?
no. come on.
that's not cool, man.
that is really insensitive.
i didn't punch him because he's gay.
i punched him, and then he happened
to turn out to be gay afterwards.
- i was gay when you punched me!
- in a weird way,
it might have been
homophobic not to punch you
-just because you were gay.
- right.
you punched a little gay
black kid in the face,
and it's not even second period.
how do you explain that?
mr. dadier, i'm so sorry about that. i just...
look, guys, i'm going to relate to you, okay?
a kid died the other day from drugs,
and nobody, including me,
is doing anything about it.
that's weird, guys.
and then you two show up, with 30 days left,
causing trouble in my school.
i am one more black gay kid
getting punched in the face
away from a nervous breakdown.
do i make myself clear?
you guys cross my line again,
and you walk into this office,
i'm going to expel you. you got me?
all right, let's do this.
which one of you is doug?
let's do that again
and pretend you guys aren't weird.
which one of you is named doug?
- no, dude, i'm brad.
- okay, good.
so that means your name is doug, son.
- yeah, i'm doug.
- great.
here are your class schedules.
funny, i wouldn't have taken you
for the brainy type.
i wouldn't.
but you <i>as</i> a drama geek, far less surprising.
thank you.
now we have the wrong identities,
you dumb-ass.
i'm in drama. i suck at drama.
it's girly and embarrassing.
oh, my god. relax, dude. who cares?
i can fake my way through band practice
and app chemistry for a few weeks.
ap chemistry. ap chemistry.
and, no, you can't,
because you don't even know
what it's actually fucking called!
it's going to be fine. you go to my classes,
and i'm going to go to yours.
okay, now, chemistry's
the one with the shapes and shit, right?
fuck.
so, we are going to hold auditions
for the peter pan part today.
billiam would've wanted the show to go on.
when i was a young actorjust starting out
in new york state,
albany, to be exact,
- i booked a local television commercial...
- hey.
...in which i had to play a young man...
it's really sad about that kid. he was talented.
so are you saying if he wasn't talented,
it would be less sad?
no. no, no, no, that's not what i meant.
i was just busting your balls.
okay. good.
i remember, one time,
doing cocaine with willie nelson's horse,
and we were having so much fun.
and then i realized that she was dead.
i remember one summer...
do kids still do this stuff?
even after what happened to him?
everyone's saying
that billiam had a heart murmur.
pretty much everyone i know does it,
but it's not my thing.
it's not really my thing, either,
but a buddy of mine really wants it.
who would he call if he wanted it?
well, you can tell your friend
that if he really wanted it,
it's not so hard to find.
when to take it.
he shouldn't have been taking it at all.
drugs are bad.
but they can have their place
in the life of a professional actor.
- thank you.
- you're welcome.
notice the distinction.
i said "professional actor."
new person. mr. texty texty.
since you have so much to say to molly,
let's see if you can be peter to our wendy.
you look like you might have
a little peter inside of you.
i can't.
i'm fine just being a tree or something
doug, you never won't know
what you can't achieve
before you don't achieve it.
my point is,
you have to. everyone auditions for peter.
yeah, sure.
my favorite molecule is water.
i'd marry it, unless it was my daughter
its solid form floats on its liquid form,
which makes it far outside the norm.
it allowed life to form on ancient mars,
and we use it to wash our cars.
h2o.
h2o. h2o.
- h20
- it's okay. thank you.
thank you, zack. so good.
all right, anybody else
for molecule mondays? anyone?
okay. time for a pop quiznos.
a what?
i'm sorry.
what is your name? brad?
- brad. yes, ma'am.
- wow. look at you,
brad. big.
what is a pop quiznos?
it's a quiz, and the first person who finishes
gets a $10 gift certificate to quiznos.
- today's quiz is on...
- you look really old.
- were you held back or something or...
- no. you look super young.
were you held forward?
i went to school in france, so
and they do, like, two extra years
of middle school there. it's so lame.
french, the language of love.
that's cool, man. it's nice to meet you also.
hey.
good luck.
<i>i've gotta crow</i>
<i>i'm just the cleverest...</i>
okay.
maybe try one cooler.
and faster.
and louder. and better.
and less insecure and more just cool.
okay, yeah, those are great notes.
i'm going to run outside,
and i'm going to utilize those,
and i'm going to come back.
it's such bullshit.
wow. you're fast.
not like that. just, let me check you out.
let me check out your chest.
check out your test... let me...
let me grade your quiz.
can i go take a dump?
yeah, okay. that's cool.
we have this "hurry back" rule,
so if you're not back in six minutes,
i have to send you to the principal.
rules are rules, so,
i guess this will have to be a quickie.
- which way is yearbook?
- i don't know.
- is it this way?
- i don't know!
- yo.
- hey.
you guys, huh?
that was a total mix-up,
what happened earlier.
- yeah.
- he feels awful. he feels...
totally, very nervous.
you're the dealer?
- you're the dealer guy?
- is that you?
yep.
so do you make the stuff or...
do i look like a fucking scientist?
no, i just sell it.
- yeah, he just sells it. come on
- yeah, no, i'm sorry.
- i meant i just...
- how many you guys want?
one each? one pop each of drugs.
you guys aren't narcs, are you?
whoa!
- dude, come on.
- no! maybe you're a narc.
you know who calls people narcs?
narcs, narc.
first of all, your argument
kind of just collapsed on itself,
because if you call us narcs,
if narcs call people narcs,
and you call us narcs, then that's kind of...
-'cause you just said that.
- they call people...
look, i don't have time for this shit.
you guys want to do this or not?
- jesus.
- yes.
- yes, yes.
- no problem.
all right, take it here so i know you're cool.
i'm sorry. what?
- we were going to take it home.
- i gotta go back to class,
-is the only thing.
- i was thinking that i was going to go home,
maybe turn down the lights,
getting snuggy, get a little weird.
i was going to take it,
and then masturbate later.
okay, i'm not asking.
take it now or get the fuck out.
i got to finish the girls' volleyball page
by lunch.
yeah?
yeah, no, it's all good.
- i love doing drugs at school.
- i'll just take the drugs right here,
in our mouths.
there you go. that's it.
what is that? barbecue? cool ranch?
have fun.
- you got to pull the trigger!
- okay.
you got to pull the trigger!
- we got to throw up, man.
- i can't.
we gotta throw up. that kid, billiam, died.
we got to throw up.
just think of something gross.
think of something gross.
- you fucking think of something.
- okay, all right, all right.
your grandma's vagina,
and there's a dick going into it.
- what the fuck are you saying?
- i don't know! i'm just trying!
- i'm trying my best! i'm just trying!
- fuck! come on, man!

i don't feel anything.
me, neither.
hey! whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
you got a pass for running around
the hallways like a couple of ding-a-lings?
<i>pass,</i> in your hand.

now i'm going to have to take you
to the principal's office.
- no, no, no, man. come on, please. sorry.
- come on, please.
you have exceptional muscle tone there,
young man.
when'd you go through puberty?
like, at seven or something?
you look like you're in your mid-20s,
for crying out loud.
mcquaid, huh? doug mcquaid.
i read your file.
you got a lot of something special
going on there, young man.
what the hell was that? god damn it, son!
don't ever raise your hand to me like that
again, all right?
i consider that a threat.
i was just saying that i'm doug.
i'm doug mcquaid. see, that's brad.
that's brad.
you're the new kid who's all county in track?
yes, i'm doug mcquaid,
the track star, and this is brad,
the science prodigy.
he's really fast.
is this funny to you guys?
so you're doug. you're doug. you're doug.
you're doug. you're doug.
here's the deal.
my track team is full
of physically incapable rejects.
i mean, if i wasn't the coach,
i'd be laughing my ass off
at how spastic they are, but i am the coach,
so i need you.
i need me some doug mcquaid.
understand?
i need you to run anchor on the 4 x 400
at today's track meet.
you do that, and i'll sign this pass.
don't blow on me, son.
i haven't trained.
guys, don't make me take you
to the principal's office.
do we have a deal?
yes.
nice.
i don't like that.
put your tongue back in your mouth.
put your tongue in your mouth, and close it
what are you doing? stop it.
actually, that's not bad.
all right, here you go.
are you guys on drugs?
okay.
one particle of unobtainium has
a nuclear reaction with a flux capacitor.

into a radioactive spider.

<i>i've gotta</i>
<i>crow!</i>
christoph, did you feel that?

i like it! i like the confidence, son!
i know y'all seen this shit before.
i know you've seen this shit before.
huge lead! huge lead! we got this. all right.
you're looking amped!

here we go! here we go!
hey, pick it up!
hey, no, mcquaid, pick it up.

oh, my god.
no, no.
no, stop.
come here. come here.
don't make a...
that is a baton penis.
speak of the devil!
dude, that was awesome
how you sabotaged that track meet, man.
organized sports are so fascist.
it makes me sick.
that's just what i do.
okay. shit, man. see you around, all right?
i don't get this school.
that was awesome.
okay, so we stayed up all night making this.
it's awesome. you're really going to like it.
all yarn work was done by jenko.
okay, captain, look,
the dealers are the popular kids,
but they're not normal popular.
they're these crunchy granola dudes
that have convinced everyone
that they're cool, and they're not cool.
it's backwards and unnatural,
and it's got to be stopped.
lead dealer, eric molson. alpha dog.
sick chicks, killer steeze.
did the aids run this year.
he's getting into berkeley, early admish,
and he totally gets me.
who put this together'? are you autistic?
it is artistic, sir, because the thing is,
-the yarn actually indicates...
- we're compiling a list
of suspicious types at school.
the users are here.
this kid was actually talking
to a tree this morning.
cut the bullshit!
i want to know who's the supplier.
we don't know. that's why
there's a question mark on his face.
that's not the way his face looks.
that's just a question mark.
infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.
simple.
sounds like you guys
really cracked the whole case.
great job. you guys are on fire
- so proud.
- like you could do any better?
we just brought down a group
of wannabe thugs
stripping down cars
in the garfield high metal shop.
- what?
- meanwhile, you two were standing around
finger-popping each other's assholes.
we're not finger-popping
each other's assholes.
what we're doing is getting shit done.
<i>yeah, as a matter of fact,</i>
<i>i'm about to infiltrate a super high-tech</i>
<i>drug manufacturing ring
in the chemistry classroom.</i>
- password!
- open the door!
- you have to say the password.
- i'm sorry. what?
what are you...
geez.
what are y'all doing?
how'd you get a key in here?
ms. griggs gave us one
so we could work, tutor, deal bakugan.
bakugan? you dealing drugs?
- let me see. you dealing drugs?
- no.
it's just a card game.
it's, like, a hybrid card game.
- see? they open up.
- battle brawlers.
- you're not doing anything illegal?
- no.
- what are you doing in here?
- i'm here to study.
good. you could use it.
you're pretty far behind, so...
you're behind. i'm ahead.
- i know everything.
- really'?
what's a covalent bond?
fuck you, man. i don't need to tell you.
i wasn't trying to be rude. sorry
i just... i don't think you know everything.
i know everything.
okay.
what kind of bullshit do they say
about a covalent bond in this school?
they say it's when two atoms
share both their electrons.
it helps them to stick together.
i could help you out if you want,
tutor you for the test.
what are you doing
with all those phones anyway?
i crack and jailbreak kids' phones
to try and save for college.
you know, i switch their wireless carriers,
get them restricted apps.
can you listen in on phone calls and stuff?
no, no, i can't install a spyvvare
to remotely monitor calls
or anything that the mic picks up.
- i can't do that at all.
- wait, you can't do it?
no, i can't.
- is he being sarcastic?
- i don't know.
so you can.
liking comic books is popular.
environmental awareness, being tolerant.
if i was just born 10 years later,
i would have been the coolest person ever.
i know. it's bullshit.
you know what?
i totally know the cause.
<i>glee. fuck you, glee.</i>
man, i got to say, this is kind of awesome.
i might become popular.
i might get in with the popular kids.
we just have to do something
wildly irresponsible to earn their trust.
you saying we should throw a party?
i'll invite molly,
and then molly will invite eric,
and that'll be the quickest way for me
to bro down with him.
wouldn't it be better if we both infiltrated
the cool kids' group?
i think it would be better if you get in
with the nerdy kids
and see what's going on over there.
that'd be the best thing for the case.
yeah. i mean, i guess that makes sense.
- hello?
- hey. is this molly?
speaking.
hey. it's schmidt.
it's doug schmug mcquaid.
hey, man.
it's so weird that you're calling me.
i pretty much text
except for when a random old relative calls.
i was just calling 'cause we're costarring
in this play together,
<i>-and.</i> . .
<i>- hello ?</i>
mom, get off the phone!
<i>sorry, do!-iq,</i>
<i>-my teen son.
- mom!</i>
<i>i love you, honey, dougie,
doug, douglas mcquaid.</i>
mom, so serious right now! stop!
<i>i'm sorry. my mom's such a dick.</i>
she just, like, smothers me with affection
and makes me feel like i'm five years old.
wow. you're a sharer. i dig that.
<i>well, i'm 18 years old, and my mom
still packs a lunch for me every day.</i>
there was this one month
where she bought me 43 stuffed animals.
<i>the doctor thought
i was gonna spontaneously grow a vagina.</i>
i didn't, though, just to be clear.
yeah, because you already had one.
exactly. i already had one.
and you don't need two vaginae.
you just don't.
<i>although you could use one as a coin purse.</i>
i never got any stuffed animals growing up.
wait, actually, that's not true. i did.
my dad gave me a stuffed puppy
the day he bailed on us.
i'm just fucking with you.
that is a weird joke.
i thought your dad abandoned your family.
no, he did walk out on us, though.
but he didn't even leave me a stuffed puppy.
just broken dreams.
oh, man. well, i guess, to that, i would say
well,
that there are some good guys out there,
and i wouldn't let, you know, one experience
taint your memory.
<i>oh, my god.</i>
are you getting choked up?
i'm sorry if i made you upset.
<i>no, it's just, you know,
i don't like when guys are mean to girls.</i>
yeah. well, thanks.
normal transition here.
actually, i'm having a party next weekend.
you should come!
you and eric and juario, whatever.
do you mind if i just put, like,
a posting on facebook?
okay. yeah, yeah!
<i>i should call you back.</i>
well, all right, i'll see you at school.
you're a great person.
-5ye-bye. <i>b</i> ye_
- bye.
<i>what the fuck are you...</i>
are y'all throwing a party?
- what?
- there's rumors in the twittersphere.
and if any of my officers
are caught giving alcohol to minors,
they'll find theyself in prison
with a snorkel duct-taped to they mouth
and me shitting down that snorkel.
that's extremely vivid. thank you.
you're the best. you are the best.
- oh, my god.
- we love you.
- enjoy the vineyard.
- you boys be good, now.
yeah, i can't believe you guys did this for us.
bye!
"we love you"? what are you doing'?
why you saying "i love you" to my mom?
- i'm in character. shut up.
- it's weird.
look, dude, it's kind of like we're brothers.
wait, how are we going to buy alcohol?
dude, i don't have a fake id.
how are we going to get drugs for the party?
oh, no.
we got a pound of coke.
we're trying to show them a good time,
not ruin their fucking lives.
pound of marijuana?
- best party ever.
- boo-yah!
to a brilliant idea
from my brilliant brother
that i love so very much.
and this is going to fucking rock.
- cheers, man.
- cheers.
- who invited you guys?
- i did!
the party's here!
- what's up, zack?
- hey, buddy.
what's up, roman?
this is crazy. this is, like,
the craziest thing i've ever been a part of.
where is eric, man? he said he'd be here.
do we have enough chips?
is this playlist too dance-y?
- feels too dance-y.
- too dance-y?
- what are you talking about?
- i don't know, it just feels dance-y.
what are you doing?
- that's my mom's kokopelli vase.
- i got it, i got it.
doug, doug, hey!
<i>hey, paul blart: molly cop.</i>
such a bad joke.
terrible, terrible.
- you guys know each other, right?
- yeah.
get ready, get ready, there's eric.
wait for the signal.
and then you come in here
looking like a rock-solid 10.
what?
what's up, man, how you doing?
eco suave.
whoa.
wow, so i'm really digging this decor.
very native american.
yeah, our parents are actually
-really into native american...
- let's rock and roll.
- sorry.
- what are y'all doing?
- come on.
- did you guys even see eric?
seriously, did you not see eric?
no offense, man, but your brother sucks.
yo, this is butt.
there's, like, no hot dudes here.
- man, let's bounce.
- we're out of here, man.
no, no, no, come on, you guys just got here
you just got here.
come on, let me at least give you a tour.
okay, boys, come on, we did it,
we can do this, just go,
just go as fast as you possibly can.
taking out the sim card.
<i>taking down eric
with the sim card information</i>
come on, csi the shit out of this thing.
- are you drunk?
- no.
have you even been drunk before?
- no, but...
- give me this.
- what?
- can we get some bitches up in here?
'cause it's just boys right now.
no, you can't get any bitches up here.
this is my parents' bedroom.
- what the fuck, bro? some privacy!
- shit, shit, shit!
and that is a really gross three-way.
but what was the girl in the back doing?
warehouse rave in ellsworth.
cool, yeah.
hey, man, thank you for the hospitality,
but we got to get going.
you know how it is, yeah?
dude, tell me about it.
is it ready? he's gonna leave right now.
it's extracting right now.
dude, it's now or never! is it ready or not?
read this.
"please wait. extracting data from sim card."
shit! it's a bust.
- keep it casual.
- yeah.
- go with the flow, dude.
- cool, man.
- i don't like to make plans or whatever.
- you got it.
- thank you again, though, man.
- all right.
eric, eric, eric. hey, man, what's up?
hey, why you here, scott?
what, kennedy high
isn't having any parties tonight?
no, i heard you guys were partying
with some new stuff.
wanted to know your hookup
so me and my boys can get in on it.
got other commitments on that front,
so, you know...
i wasn't asking.
whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
take five, take five, man, let me get this.
i got this.
- yeah? you sure?
- i got this one.
hey, big player, i don't know who you are.
- don't worry about who i am.
- i'm worried about it.
- why?
-'cause you're at my party right now, dude.
this is my temple,
this is where i come to find peace, dawg,
and you're coming in here
like an emotional bull in a china shop,
metaphorically knocking over vases,
messing with my crew,
and i'm like, "what, scott, what, scott,
what, what, what, what, scott?"
- it's that kind of party?
- yeah, dude.
matter of fact, it's getting hot in here, huh?
- no, it's getting real.
- it's getting very real.
yeah. it's like seven strangers
living in one house. true story.
- you want <i>real</i> world?
- yeah, let's do it, man.
- come on. what's your real...
- here's real world.
what was that? did you hear that?
real enough for you?
schmidt. doug.

shit! that hurt worse than when he hit me!
fight normal.
yo, i'm serious.
sorry.
- i'll fucking kill you!
- i'm sorry! i'm very sorry!
seriously, use your words, use your words!
i kicked him in the nuts.
fight's over, dude! fight's over! fight's over!
no, watch my mom's shit, man!
- i'm gonna fucking kill you!
- you'll knock over my mom's vase!
- fuck your mom's vase!
- fuck this!
oh, shit!
yeah!
that's my brother!
- that was insane!
- you're so cool!
did you see that shit? that was crazy.
oh, shit.
when did i get stabbed?
that's awesome.
yeah!
is that a cop?
where?
no, it's not. here.
i'm so glad we're going back
to get my phone.
i just hope we don't wake up schmidty.
oh, my god, he's a policeman now.
it's like we're living with a narc.
the boy is an angel.
pull it out!
pull it out! pull it out! pull it out!
sorry!
okay, let's take some shots.
shots, shots!
that's like us fucking mother earth
without a condom.
what the fuck is going on?
annie, hang on.
are you fucking kidding me?
get out of my house. i said get out!
the party's over!
i'm sorry, mom, i'm sorry!
the mom is coming!
- listen to me!
- chill out! chill out!
- let go of me!
- you're embarrassing me
-in front of my friends!
- get back here, you shit!
dude, that was so crazy, man.
i swear, best party i've been to in years.
dude, i'm doing crazy stuff like that,
-like, all the time, man.
- i bet you are.
dude, i'm so amped right now, god!
you, dude, i like you, man.
how do you feel about making
a little extra money?
whatever it is, i'm in.
all right, here's the deal.
okay, i can't sell all this shit on my own,
but i only bring in people i like.
okay, you do good,
maybe we bring you in on what we're doing,
i introduce you to my hookup.
how's that sound?
- cool with me.
- my man.
that is my man...
that was nuts. i lost you guys.
hey, thank you again for the party, man.
yo, yo.
come on!
"i love dick"?
you think that's funny?
<i>"wonder years douche"?</i>
what kind of a sick animal draws
an ejaculating penis
into an 8-year-old's mouth?
it's arguably, like, an airplane throwing up.
you think i don't know
that's a dick and balls?
i know all about dick and balls!
i partied with robert downey jr.
before he got sober,
when he was really fucked up
and a lot of fun!
you know what?
from now on, you're gonna do some chores.
you're gonna wash the laundry,
you're gonna fold it,
you're gonna do the dishes,
you're gonna mow the lawn...
dude, i have a surprise for you.
last night at the party, i took eric's phone
and i had zack put
this monitoring device in it,
so we're gonna get to hear every single thing
that little prick is up to.
dude, i don't know if that was a good idea.
what?
- what if you had gotten found out?
- but it worked.
this is, like,
the smartest move i've ever pulled,
so, i'm sorry,
what are you getting mad at me for?
i'm not getting mad at you.
i'm glad you have something to do.
good.
what's up?
great job, schmidt
- password!
- kneel before zod!
you may enter.
thank you, zod.
let's tap that wire, huh?
we were just about to go outside
with a bunch of chemicals.
we were going to test what blows up.
there's no reason the wiretap
is super urgent, right'?
not that i can think of
that would make sense.
go for it, go for it.
- look out.
- go, go, go!
yes!
yes, that's what i'm talking about!
that's what i'm talking about!
i love this science shit!
this is what you guys do all day?
let's do it again.
are you texting molly?
what?
i don't... molly...
maybe. is that...
whoa, it's cool, man, come on.
i'm not some, like,
'50s letterman who pins a girl.
i mean, yeah, we blow each other sometimes,
but it's not a thing.
i just, like... i don't know,
i don't believe in possessions, ja feel?
ja feel, ja definitely feel.
- yeah.
- schmidty?
schmidty.
phyllis.
- i'll be right back, dude.
- okay.
hey. how are you?
- how is my favorite police officer?
- okay.
your mother told me that you are undercover.
listen, now is not a really good time.
are you undercover right now?
yes, it means i'm undercover right now.
are those the bad guys over there?
do they have guns? oh, my god.
oh, god, this is so exciting.
i have got to call annie. she is gonna die.
i heard that that jenko boy is your partner.
- where is my phone?
- okay, okay.
shut your fucking mouth.
shut your fucking mouth,
you understand me?
let's go check this out.
i will straight-up punch you in the face
if you do not shut up.
- there is no...
- a straight-up face punch.
i swear to god, you're gonna get me killed.
- hey, yo.
- that is...
shit! she just tried to grab my dick, dude!
- what? you tried to grab his...
- she tried to grab myjunk.
she was like, "oh, my god, i have arthritis,
"it hurts my hand,
i need to grab a handful of that dick."
i was like, "get the fuck off me!"
she said, "i need to grab
a handful of that dick"?
and it felt good,
but then it felt weird for a second,
so i pushed her. we got to get out of here.
all right, cool, let's get the...
so your parents are just cool
with having people over whenever?
yeah, you know, they're out most nights.
pretty laissez-faire about the whole thing.
you're so lucky your parents
don't give a shit about you.
right?
- this place is awesome.
- yeah.
hey.
hey, what's up?
how's it going?
wow, that's a bigger hug
than i was expecting.
sorry. i'm happy to see you.
yeah. yeah, me, too.
- h6y-
- hey-
good?
- all right, come on.
- yeah, let's...
i brought tacos, so that's cool.
<i>try to turn it, try to turn it, spoiler alert</i>

is going down today.
<i>take down eco-pussy</i>
<i>take down eco-pussy!</i>
<i>mother earth, mother earth is dying</i>

- it used to be a planet.
- it's ready.
- not any more.
<i>reduce, reuse</i>
<i>recycle</i>
i'm embarrassed.

- do not feel exposed.
i got to use the bathroom.
- is it in there?
- yeah, yeah, right up there, dude.
all right, all right, all right, all right.
god damn that.
the mic is live and we can
hear how the other half lives.
what are you doing?
i heard something.
<i>hey, can i ask you something? sit down.</i>
<i>okay.</i>
i just want to make sure
that you and eric are going to be careful
with whatever it is
that you're getting involved in.
yeah, i promise we will.
it would just suck
if something bad happened,
because you're a good guy.
yeah, no, i feel the same way about you,
except girl version.
you're a girl.
- i am.
- yeah.
that's why i put this dress on,
-to remind you.
- exactly.
- are you excited about the play?
- yes.
yeah, you were just
-right in there with excitement.
- yes.
- no hesitash.
- i'm very excited.
yeah.
does that make me a super nerd?
no, not at all.
<i>we get to act together:</i>
what a vagina. he has no chance with her.
so...
- shit.
- sorry.
you're on the prom committee.
do you think it's going to be fun?
did shejust bring up prom on her own?
- she did, she just brought up prom.
- what is she doing?
i think it's going to be awesome.
- prom eats a dong.
- multiple dongs.
all right, anyone who says
they don't care about prom
actually secretly does.
who we gonna take to the prom?
no one's going to prom with us.
come on, picture it.
you pull up in a white stallion of a limo.
you got fine-ass honeys with you.
you're dressed to the nines
with your best buds.
doves fly out behind you, slow motion.
doves. why doves?
'cause doves make you look
like a badass, that's why.
i am pretty skeptical,
but maybe, if someone fun asked me,
i would go.
aren't... isn't... aren't you and eric...
wouldn't you and eric go together?
not that i know of.
would you...
he's going to choke.
he always chokes.
he's going to choke, wait for it.
so would...
so would...
would you...
mayb...
- oh, my god. are you okay?
- yeah.
that is the actual sound of choking.
i was wondering if you...
would you
maybe want to go
with me to prom?
would you want to go to me...
maybe with me to prom?
yes.
i would love to go to prom with you.
what? she just said yes!
- whoa.
- wow.
good for you, doug.
thank you for asking.
put her there, man.
just put... put it right there.
i'm putting it right there.
<i>yeah. there you guys are.</i>
<i>what's up, my man?</i>
- hi.
- how you doing?
- whazzup?
- yeah.
doug... okay, settle an argument.
you and your brother aren't related, right?
'cause you look totally different.
he's adopted.
<i>we all suspect from a very lame family.</i>
<i>where is he tonight?</i>
<i>probably at home with those lame tools
he hangs out with. i don't know.</i>
you know how tom cruise is
always pissed off at rain man?
that's like my life,
except brad is really shitty at math.
your brother's kind of a dick.
well, yeah.
he kind of is, isn't he?
don't listen to that.
i don't give a fuck.
dude, eric is the funniest im-er.
oh, fuck.
hey, guys. it's so funny seeing you here.
how are you? guess what, i don't care.
we just closed our third
high school operation.
and check what we found at kennedy.
looks like we're going to have to do
your job for you.
your drugs is spreading
to different schools now, sucker.
you failed to stop the outbreak,
and you have no leads!
we are running out of time!
you either find the supplier,
or i'm gonna jump your <i>asses</i>
off jump street!
i totally understand
where you're coming from, sir,
but, look, i heard eric
talking on the phone yesterday
with somebody that sounded very suspect
about meeting up with a stuffed pifiata.
is that a code for sex?
- pifiata? really?
- yep.
remember that wiretap
i put on eric's phone?
while you were having the time of your life
last night, i was listening.
i overheard a phone call between eric
and some dude about a pifiata.
that's all you heard?
yep.
<i>i am so nervous.</i>
we are about to premiere
in front of the whole school.
i apologize in advance
if i throw up on you onstage.
serious question, though.
how do i look?
ravishing.
is it too sexy of an outfit?
bend the knee a little bit.
yep, it is.
it's going to be so much easier
having you onstage with me.
i am so happy that i met you.
you're, like, the only guy
that i can really trust.
yep. that's me.
doug.
potassium nitrate.
don't hate. it's great.
it can act as an oxidizer.
i didn't know that, but now i'm wiser.
it has a crystalline structure.
if you can't respect that,
you're a butt muncher.
it's a key ingredient in gunpowder.
k-no-three, don't give no grief.
it can be used to make corned beef.
it's also known <i>as</i> saltpeter.
- brad?
- shit.
where are you going?
i don't want to look like
it's like i'm wearing makeup.
- right.
- doug! hi.
brad!
whoa. what are you wearing?
potassium nitrate. thanks for noticing.
i need to borrow you.
now's not a good time, brad.
it's a really good time.
'cause my pifiata is killing me.
is that code for a sex thing?
it's leaving the parking lot.
pifiata?
molly.
i will be right back.
i need to help brad with something, okay?
i just need to help brad
with something real quick.
- what? no. what?
- i promise you...
do you understand how soon
the show is starting?
i swear to you
i will be back in time for curtain.
- i swear. i swear to you.
- tell me you understand how soon...
what? are you kidding me?
what did i say? what did i say?
see? whose wiretap is
working for him now, huh?
shit.
fuck!
you told me not to worry about the tickets!
i thought they made us look cool.
- cones, cones...
- driver's ed car.
- i'm driving.
- no, you're not.
- i never get to drive. i'm driving this time.
- fine! drive!
- hey, guys.
- just borrowing this for one sec.
- sure.
- go. go, go, go, go.
guys, hey, wait. guys, you're not on the list.
hey, guys, wait! who cares?
- holy fucking shit.
- no fucking way.
those are the guys from the park.
that's just too crazy.
what do you think's in that thing?
i don't know, money, drugs.
they could be a new buyer,
or they could be the supplier.
if it's good, you'll hear from me.
if it's not good, you'll hear from me
about telling you how it's not good.
makes sense.
- get the fuck out of here.
- yeah, no worries, man.
i'll see you guys.
we definitely got to follow
them and find out, though.
- get down! get down!
- get down! get down!
- what are you doing?
- if they see us,
just pretend like you're sucking my dick.
- what? no!
- yes. stop.
you pretend like you're sucking my dick.
no, just pretend like you're sucking my dick.
why am i automatically blowing you?
'cause you're in
a fucking peter pan costume!
okay.
okay, let's go. let's go, let's go.
- go, go, go.
- okay, fine, we'll follow them.
but we need to be back in
dude, did you just hit the teacher brake?
yeah, you're following too close, dude.
- they're going to make us.
- well, if i go too far back,
it's going to look even
more suspicious, so just stop.
god, just let me do my thing.
i know what i'm doing.
seriously, if you do that again,
i'm going to whac-a-mole you in the balls.
just stay back.
- i could not be more serious.
- take your foot off the brake.
- no. i'm not... no.
- take your foot off the brake!
oh, shit! oh, shit!
- look what you did!
- look what you did!
what the fuck?

oh, my god! oh, my god!

you just got head-butted, motherfucker!
- go, go, go, go, go, go!
- shit.
check around for a gun or something,
all right?
where? where?
there's no glove compartment
in this shitty-ass car!
there's golf balls and this.
- what am i supposed to do with this?
- i don't know, man!
i've never been in a freeway chase before!
watch out! it's going to explode!
it's going to go!
- what happened?
- i don't know.
- it just didn't explode.
- that's weird.
can anybody tell me where my peter is?
french! you're not my first choice,
but i need you to go on as peter.
oh, gosh. and i've been in character
for months now.
great. nobody cares.
come on! another traffic jam?
i'm sorry i didn't check the traffic report
-before we got in a car chase!
- let's go! come on!

- yes, you are! you're texting!
- no, i'm not!
okay, almost done.
<i>iilol.ll</i>

why do you always jump
over the car like that?
hi. hi. how are you?
- hi.
- god damn, you are beautiful.
- oh. hi.
- you are fine as shit.
don't worry. someone will pick you up.
- wow.
- hurry. just drive.
wait. pick me up?
- they're coming! they're coming!
- i got an idea.
why don't you text them
and ask them to stop chasing us?
oh, shit!
he's got a gun!
i'm going to throw this thing at him!
okay, you don't have to narrate everything!
- just throw it!
- okay! okay, okay!
- it's going to explode!
- oh, my god! roll up the windows!
- what the fuck is that going to do?
- roll it up!
- i don't fucking care! just do it!
- oh, god!
i really thought that one
was going to explode.
oh, shit!

why did you shoot for me?
you weren't shooting, you were choking,
-so i had to save us.
- i was going to shoot.
- you always do this, every single time.
- what?
seriously, just take me back to school, man.
if i miss this play, molly's going to freak out
and she's not going to go to prom with me.
- are you fucking serious right now?
- fuck, yes, i'm serious!
can't believe you made me late.
you're so selfish.
- i'm selfish?
- yes, you're selfish!
are you fucking kidding me?
look at yourself!
you're in too deep, man.
yesterday, i found
a college application on your desk!
i don't know how long this case
is going to last.
and eric's going to get into berkeley,
and, honestly, i can get in, too.
who knows? i could ride this thing out.
i could be a doctor or something.
have you lost your fucking mind?
you screwed this investigation all up.
at least i know my miranda rights, you idiot.
you are a very silly man indeed.
boys, squaws, come quickly.
hey! sorry! it's okay. i'm here.
i know i missed the first few scenes.
i want to thank...
give it up to french samuels
-for ably backing me up.
- fuck you, doug! what?
i say we just roll right into this thing, huh?
this is my twin. we're together in...
get the fuck out of here.
what are you doing?
have you completely lost your mind?
what is this?
i don't know, but it's already more exciting.
you're embarrassing me.
it's okay. i'll make it up to you.
and... let's fly!
- such bullshit!
- get off of me!
i'm not dumb! i'm smart!
you think i'm stupid? you're stupid!
- go, doug!
- i guess i should do something.
i should probably not
just stand here watching.
i should take action.
worst best friend ever!
m°iiy, i'm sorry!
i don't want to talk to you ever again.
i'm sorry.
you stupid idiot!
- come here!
- come on!

principal dadier sucks dick!
you're supposed to be my friend!
stop! stop it. you're expelled.
both of you are expelled.
and that's the end of act two.
is that it? you're not going to scream at us?
nope.
i'm gonna just fire you.
moving out?
yep.
you know what's crazy to me
is that i think that i actually
thought that we were brothers.
i would've tooken a bullet for you.
get in now. both of you.
why should i?
just get in the car, man.
get in the fucking car.
nope, not until you ask nicely.
please get in the car.
come on, you guys. come on. please. jesus.
some messed up shit went down yesterday.
yeah, after we made the exchange,
our potential business partners
got followed by some fucking cops.
that's insane, man.
are you serious?
okay, it's just i don't want to go to jail!
you know what happens to
a handsome guy like me in jail?
it rhymes with "grape"!
it rhymes with "grape."
i can't let that happen.
so i got these from my dad's gun cabinet.
- eric, eric, eric, eric.
- whoa. come on. whoa.
springfield .45s, police issue.
very powerful guns.
you ever use one?
- we're not really gun people, man. no.
- no?
a lot of things
have made me wonder about you.
come on.
your taste in music
the fact that you look
like a fucking 40-year-old man.
then after that shit at the play, i realized
there's no way you guys could be cops.
yeah, i got this deal going down.
the supplier's going to be there.
i need people i can trust.
all right. all right, come on.
okay, right over here,
we're going to shoot these bottles.
- we're going to practice, okay?
- okay.
that was... that was actually
really fuckin' awesome.
beginner's luck.
all right.
the supplier wants the deal
to go down at prom.
all right, there's going to be
all these heavies there,
but as long as you guys have my back...
yeah? yeah? shit.
i always got your back.
time to get our jobs back.
let's get ready for prom.
schmidty! chore time!
mom, we don't have time
for chores right now!

there you go.
thanks.
your shotgun's hanging too low.
they're gonna see it.
thanks.
jenko...
will you go to prom with me?
i guess.
are we really going to take down
a whole drug operation by ourselves?
i got some contacts that'll help us.
brad, what are you doing here?
you can't be here.
what if the principal sees you?
- this is wrong, yet so right.
- what?
i am so happy you're willing
to get in trouble for me.
you have to go. please, don't leave me ever.
ms. griggs, stop. stop.
- stay! stay.

and i don't want you to get hurt.
i've already been hurt, doug. i don't care.
you need to leave. you need to leave.

what are you gonna do?
oh, yeah.
you boys are so good at this.
oh, yeah, cinnamon!
oh, my god,
we're getting such good evidence.
<i>i stole some of that bunsen burner crap</i>
from the chem lab,
threw in some of my cool deets,
<i>and it was muy deliciosol</i>
then one day i catch
eco butt-munch over here
smoking a j.j. behind the field house,
and i'm like,
"hey, you want to make some coin?"
what a green penis that guy is, huh?
there's my quesadilla.
i hurt my hands!

nah, nah, it's cool, man,
they're my boys, so...
- are they?
- yeah.
i don't like strangers.

to make any new friends with that attitude?
it's, like, everyone's a stranger
till you give them a chance, man.
what the fuck are you talking about?
i don't even...
just fuckin' around.
do your thing, man. proceed
hey, kid, come here.
you, you look familiar.
- me?
- yeah.
i was in a french fry commercial
when i was a kid,
so people are like, you know, often say,
"oh, i think i know you,"
but i don't think we've ever met before.
do i look like i eat french fries?
i don't know, you look like
you're in great shape,
but maybe you have, like, one cheat day,
like a carb blowout, you know'? i don't know.
nah.
yeah, the theme song was, like...
<i>come to andrew's french fry emporium</i>
<i>where friendship and french fries</i>
<i>go hand in hand</i>
that's my quesadilla!
who wants a piece? huh?
i know you're in there, doug,
or whatever your name is!
you lied to me!
i'm gonna kill you, you stupid fucking cop!
hey, you guys, shejust called me

- i don't give a damn!
you're fucking cops?
but we partied together, man.

oh, come on, that's unfair!
we put our guns down in good faith.
you're a liar, and you're mean!

i know sometimes i was a jerk to you
when we were undercover.
it's just... i didn't feel good about myself.
all that stuff i wore, like the bracelets,
the rings, the tight pants,

the only approval
that i ever needed
was my best friend.

we're fucked.
give me my money!
i got an idea.
- you still got those shotgun shells?
- yeah.
pop quiznos.
what do you get when lithium batteries
react to potassium nitrate?
that would be a covalent bond, brother.
that's when two atoms, they share electrons.
you see, they both need
what the other one has.
that makes them stick together.
are you saying we're covalent bonds?
what? no.
we're not atoms, dude.
- what's this?
- tequila?
i don't know, it was supposed to explode.
oh, shit!
where'd you learn how to do that, man?
app chemistry, bitch.
come on, blondie.

i didn't mean to shoot you!
i meant to shoot him!
are you alive, buddy? you okay?

yeah, i'm feeling a little ambivalent
about that right now.

- you have the right to remain silent!
anything you say can
and will be used against you
in a court of law!
you have the right to an attorney!
