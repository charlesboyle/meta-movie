<i>the only thing
i ever knew was cotton.</i>
<i>it was hard work.</i>
now, you know cotton is ready
when the bud splits,
and the boll is star-shaped,
like a big ol' star in the sky.
or like your big ol' head.
hold on, is that some cotton?
is that cotton?
<i>but i didn't mind, </i>
<i>'cause i got to spend all day
working with my daddy.</i>

- yes'm.
and quiet when you're serving.
i don't even want
to hear you breathe.

<i>the room should feel
empty when you're in it.</i>
<i>it was much nicer working
in the house than in the field.</i>
crazy nigger, from the left.
give me more.
hmm.
<i>when i got older, i knew
i had to go before he killed me, too.</i>
<i>part of me was scared to leave.</i>
<i>it was the only world i ever knew.</i>
ma, i took pa's watch.
ma?
ma, i'm leaving.
<i>my mama never
spoke much after that.</i>
<i>i knew she'd miss me, </i>
<i>but i also knew she wanted me
to leave that place.</i>
<i>and even though
miss annabeth never said it, </i>
<i>i knew she'd miss me, too.</i>
<i>i don't think god meant
for people to not have a family.</i>
<i>outside the cotton fields was even worse
than i thought it would be.</i>
<i>no one would give me a job
nor food nor a place to sleep.</i>
<i>any white man could kill
any of us at any time</i>
<i>and not be punished for it.</i>
<i>the law wasn't on our side.</i>
<i>the law was against us.</i>
<i>i was hungry all the time.</i>
you know what can happen
to you, son?
get up.
i said, get up.
i'm gonna have to lie
to the boss man about that window.
the good lord say
we ain't supposed to lie.
sorry, sir.
where's your ma and your pa?
my ma crazy in the head,
and my pa got killed.
i'll make you
some ham sandwiches
and send you on your way.
the boss will be here
in a minute.
sunday's our busiest morning.
you looking for some help?
i know how to serve.
you done broke our window,
you done stole our food,
and now you asking for a job?
back in macon,
i'm a house nigger, a good one.
don't you ever use that word, son.
that's the white man's word.
it's filled with hate.
didn't your father
ever teach you any better?
- slow down.
- yes, sir.
you got to look through their eyes.
see what it is they want.
- got it?
- strokes.
- yeah, i got it.
- here.
see what it is they need.
right this way.
anticipate.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry, ma'am.
bring a smile to the eyes...
<i>...of your principal.</i>
perfect. perfect.
don't forget to save me them chitlins.
- why you like chitlins so much?
- 'cause they're good eating.
the manager of excelsior, in dc,
he came by yesterday.
he offered me a job as a butler.
he must be paying you
top dollar, huh, boss?
yeah.
i was thinking about taking it,
but i don't know.
i'm too old to be leaving
north carolina.
i'm just fine right here.
i told him to hire you.
i'm just now finding my way
around this hotel.
ain't ready for all them
highfalutin white people,
all their fancy words.
ours,
and the ones that we got
to show the white folks.
now, to get up in the world,
you have to make
them feel nonthreatened.
use that, them fancy words
that i've taught you.
white folks up north,
they like some uppity coloreds.
yeah.
<i>i took that job
up in washington, dc.</i>
<i>it was the most beautiful hotel
i'd ever seen.</i>
i hope it wasn't
too presumptuous of me
to have prepared a few spirits
after your long journey here
from buffalo.
the best decision that court ever
made was to slow this whole mess down.
nigger boys in school with white girls.
who ever heard of such a thing?
next thing you know,
they'd be fornicating.
gentlemen, this here is different.
we could start another civil war.
cecil, what do you think about niggers
going to school with white children?
to be honest with you,
mr. jenkins,
i tend to not be too concerned
with american or european politics.
nor should you, cecil.
they're all criminals.
earl warren should be shot
and hanged.
that dumb son-of-a-bitch judge
is trying to integrate our schools.
i think judge warren is going to find
that quite challenging.
damn right, cecil. damn right.
<i>never in my life did i dream
i'd work in a place as fancy as this.</i>
<i>i never dreamed my life
could be so good.</i>
<i>gloria and i met working
at the excelsior.</i>
<i>she was a maid at the hotel, </i>
<i>but now her only job
was raising our two boys.</i>
<i>i made sure that they
never laid eyes on a cotton field.</i>
- i got to pee.
- not today. don't try that.
- finish that homework.
- where louis at?
- he's taking the trash out.
- working late again?
- how was your shift?
- beats working for a living.
i miss you at night, honey.
didn't you say you got to pee?
go on, then.
wash your hands when you come
out of that bathroom, boy.
- good morning.
- good morning.
good morning, sir.
mm-hm.
- hey, dad.
- hey, louis.
- you all right?
- yeah, i'm fine.
- good.
- that woman whose son got killed,
she's around doing speeches now.
what's her name, honey?
- mamie till.
- mamie...
mamie till. mm.
i remember that story just
like it was yesterday,
even though it was three years ago.
it was a dis-damn-grace
what they did to that boy.
just for looking at a white woman.
beat him up,
threw his body in the river,
killed him.
he wasn't no older than louis.
he was 14 at the time.
- crazy white folks down south.
- thanks, ma.
at least we got it
a little better in dc, huh?
still treating us bad, too.
get on down here, charlie!
wash your hands.
louis said we should stop
taking the white man's shit.
- hey.
- shut up.
- watch your mouth.
- watch your mouth.
hello, gaines' residence.
uh, yeah. hold on, mr. kidgan.
- it's the boss man, dad.
- what's he calling for?
<i>when the white man call,
i always assume the worst.</i>
yes, sir?
<i>i would have put money on it</i>
<i>that i was getting laid off
or something that day.</i>
- would you follow me, please?
- yes, sir.
i'm cecil gaines.
- it's a pleasure to meet you.
- you, as well.
have a seat.
are you political, mr. gaines?
- no, sir.
- good.
we have no tolerance
for politics at the white house.
- how'd you find me?
- i didn't.
you served r.d. warner
at the excelsior hotel.
he oversees operations
for the entire white house.
- you made quite an impression.
- i don't recall.
mr. warner and myself make note
of potential staff around town.
butler positions rarely open,
as most stay on for 30 years or more.
i know i was quite surprised
when i got the call.
it was a surprise
for me, as well.
as the white house maître d',
i normally hire the butler.
forgive me for saying this,
mr. fallows.
i certainly wouldn't want to
be hired under circumstances
that would make you
feel uncomfortable.
oh, really?
you need butlers
that you've handpicked,
men to your liking
that will fulfill your vision
of a proper white house staff.
hmm.
is that... louis xiii?
these decanters are replicas
of metal flasks that were found
on the battlefield in jarnac.
correct?
the italians, they
know their wines,
and the irish, they certainly know
how to make a great whiskey.
but i believe the french
have a distinct advantage
when it comes to cognac.
<i>c'est vrai?</i>
yeah, you'll make
a good house nigger.
would you care
for a demitasse?
sometimes it just be
me and faye up in here.
me, faye
and a little scotch.
have a good time.
that's how you do it.
you know how to throw
a bash, girl.
what did you do
to this potato salad?
i'll tell you what i did.
i put some dill in it,
because i read in woman's day,
where pickles drown out the flavor
and dill bring up the flavor.
- that's what you tasting right now.
- ok. yeah.
- i like it.
- make a difference, don't it?
it really does.
girl, you must be so proud of cecil.
you know he got that job hisself.
the white house called him,
- he didn't call the white house.
- he's a good man.
- you got a good man.
- she's fun, man!
not like this one right here.
oi' sourpuss.
- you still mad at me?
- i got reason.
no, you don't. i told you,
i went down to the numbers spot,
played my little numbers,
got me some barbecue,
and then i went down...
i didn't even get nothing to drink!
i am so... i'm so sick of these
numbers spot stories, howard.
how you expect me to believe you
was down at the numbers spot?
whether you believe it
or not don't mean it ain't true.
- come on, stop this mess.
- you want to do this right now?
come on, y'all.
come on, come on, come on.
you don't believe it, you don't
have to believe it, but...
- come on, y'all.
- such a shuckster.
- you really want to do this right now?
- stop this right now.
you need to pick on
somebody your own size.
we are here to celebrate,
so y'all could be nice just one time.
you heard the lady.
come on, get over here, let's celebrate!
celebrate.
that's why i was out,
trying to make you happy.
- y'all need to get a room.
- what? what?
ain't that the truth?
or something.
he drives me crazy. he just... ugh!
you ain't, uh...
you want to come to the room with us?
no.
- hey, where the boys at?
- they upstairs in the back room.
boys! get on down here!
i need to see your face now!
- what y'all doing up there?
- yes, congratulations.
honey, when you gonna take me
to the white house?
you want to go
to the white house, baby?
you know i want to go
to the white house.
when you want to go?
- don't play with me now...
- when you want to go?
the white house,
now that's a big step up.
- ooh!
- yeah, it's exciting.
girl, you up in that house now!
i want to hear all the stories.
i don't know how many stories
you gonna hear,
'cause they done swore him
to some kind of secret code,
- and he can't tell me nothing.
- no. girl, you give it to him right.
- mm-hm! he'll tell you everything.
- that's the key right there.
you listening?
- did you hear her?
- who you been giving it to?
well, if you was at home,
i could be giving it to you.
i don't know
what you talking about.
boys, y'all better bring
y'all little narrow butts down here!
- here they come.
- called y'all 19 times.
boys, stop running through this house.
you know better than that.
elroy! get over here.
come here.
give me some money.
nah. tell them... tell them what
you gonna be when you grow up.
i want to work at the white
house just like mr. gaines.
- ah, that's my boy.
- right there.
all right, man.
louis! what you gonna be
when you grow up?
you gonna work at
the white house like your daddy?
- i don't know.
- i'll tell you one thing.
i knew exactly what i wanted
to be when i was 13.
yeah, a number runner.

<i>there are 16 full-time maids.</i>
<i>we have six butlers,

for the opportunity
to work in the white house...
come on. here we go.
ma'am, i'm cecil gaines.
i'll be working with you here.
mr. gaines,
please don't do that.
- come on.
- yes, sir.
now, when lifting a plate,
never scrape the bottom.
never listen
or react to conversation.
- the room should feel as...
- empty when i'm in it.
so then she says...
then she says, "stick..."
"ok."
then she starts
screaming and yells,
"stick your whole hand in!"
so i put my whole hand in.
then she yells out,
"put both hands in!"
"ok!"
then she screams,
"now clap!"
i say, "i can't."
she looks up, smiles and says,
"see, i told you my..."
that ain't funny.
hey, there he is!
heard you were coming.
- what's your name?
- cecil.
- cecil gaines.
- that ain't funny.
i'm carter wilson, head butler.
don't worry about big mo behind you.
that brother will steal your wallet
before you even knew it.
this brother in the mirror over here,
his name's james holloway.
- he's my second in command.
- james.
jackie robinson or willie mays?
why don't you shake
the man's hand first
before you start asking difficult
questions like that?
i just want to know
where the man's coming from.
look like the jury's still
out on that one, right?
welcome.
fancy freddie give you the tour yet?
he did.
is the dodgers still... still losing?
i might be able to answer that question
if carter over here
stop running his nasty mouth.
cut the shit
and let's get to work.
- ready.
- lord, help us.
don't be nervous, man.
just go on and get to it.
you hear nothing,
you see nothing.
you only serve.
send federal troops to little rock?
if it comes to it, yes.
i can't see any situation where
i'd send federal troops to the south.
ever. could cause another civil war.
sir, if the federal government
doesn't enforce brown, then who will?
the south must comply with the law.
it's just gonna take some time
to adjust, that's all.
i understand, mr. president,
but if faubus continues to block the
negro children, then what do we do?
we must enforce
the constitution.
give faubus more time.
with a little persuading,
he'll back down.
we just want to move slowly.
- how'd it go?
- i almost shit myself.
i dated a girl once. every time
i hit her, she shit herself.
- what?
- got no sense.
- shut up.
- you shut up.
i put a towel down.
<i>you know, marcella said
the very same thing last night</i>
<i>just before i put her to sleep.</i>
<i>- wow. you put her...
- just like i did ed.</i>
<i>i'd do it real quick.</i>
<i>- see you!
- why?</i>
dang...

your dad's gonna kill...
hey, dad.
- hi, mr. gaines.
- hey, dad.
hey, elroy.
louis, i told you about letting these
kids watch that show.
it's too scary.
they're too young for it.
turn it off.
<i>all you got to do is smile pretty, </i>
<i>and a man will forget
everything he ever learned.</i>
where your mama at?
miss gloria tried staying up,
but she went to sleep.
elroy, ain't nobody
asked you nothing.
take your butt home before
your mama come up in here
and whup the both of us.
- come on, dad.
- go on.
- bye.
- turn it off.

- i want to go to this.
- absolutely not.
how come?
ain't no good can come of that.
dad, you heard what mama said?
that mess right there
happened down south.
- this could have been me.
- it happened down south.
i got out of there so we
could have us a better life.
right now, i'm working for the white
man, make things better for us.
and not just any white man, either.
put the lights off.
go to bed.
i have your chicken soup,
mr. president.
just set it on the table, cecil.
yes, sir.
did you ever complete school, cecil?
i didn't go to school,
mr. president.
i grew up on a cotton farm.
i grew up on a farm.
do you have any children?
yes, sir, i have two sons.
do they go
to an all-colored school?
yes, sir, they do.
what is it?
state guard just blocked
all the colored kids again.
faubus promised me the guards
would escort the kids in.
governor of arkansas lied,
mr. president.
what is wrong with him?
why is he forcing me to do this?
yes, sir.
our next move
needs to be bold and swift.
<i>i have today
issued an executive order</i>
<i>directing the use of troops
under federal authority</i>
<i>to aid in the execution
of federal law</i>
<i>at little rock, arkansas.</i>
<i>this became necessary...</i>
<i>when the president
sent those troops down to little rock, </i>
<i>it was the first time i ever seen a
white man stick his neck out for us.</i>
<i>i told louis that the president was
gonna make things better for us.</i>
all graduations are long.
she was so nosy.
i'm gonna make
some potato salad.
<i>now he could see that i knew
what i was talking about.</i>
that was wonderful.
i'm so proud of you.
- thanks, mama.
- that hat looks stupid.
your face looks stupid.
- proud of you, too.
- dad, did you see...
don't start something in there.
did you see one white kid
in my school?
<i>why couldn't louis see that
the president made things better for us?</i>
- thank you.
- cookie?
- cookies.
- thanks.
thank you.
boy, i told you
we was gonna be late!
you cannot miss this bus!
- oh, lord have mercy.
- wait, a sec. wait, wait, wait.

- got to say good-bye.
bus can wait.
tennessee is
a long ways away, pop.
fisk is a really
good school, dad.
you can change your mind
and go to howard.
i cannot believe you are still
talking about howard university.
- he's going to fisk.
- i know, i know. it's just...
it's just so far away, that's all.
- that's the point.
- what's the point?
give me a cigarette, and don't
tell me you don't smoke.
- i don't have one.
- come here.
- you know you want to cry, punk.
- not for you.
look under your mattress.
i left you something.
- i can't protect him down south.
- the south has changed, cecil.
i'm too young for playboy.
the south ain't what it
was when you was there.
ma, louis is leaving me
his filthy magazines.
- stop lying on your brother.
- why you slapping him?
he's the one with the magazines.
- i love you, mama.
- i love you, son.
- i love you, louis.
- i love you.
- i made you ham sandwiches.
- thanks, mama.
come on, dad.
ok.
you're the first.
i know.
i'm really proud of you.
i got to go, dad.
i got to go.
if you need anything, you call me.
- all right.
- all right?
bye, mama.
bye, louis.
it's all right.
remind me again why
we're doing this, please.
somebody? tell me?
that look like a mugging to me,
- that's what that looks like.
- this is the art of french baking.
negro, please.
"art of french baking."
this is absolutely nothing.
that's what this is.
- i don't...
- boy's always so simple.
you want me to play with it?
i'll play with it.
play with it like this.
it'd be good if it had a little...
a little nipple on it.
come on, man.
that's how you play. you jiggle it.
you shake it, you know.
this fool.
good evening,
mr. vice president.
that looks like a tasty treat.
yes, sir.
i brought you all something.
thank you, mr. vice president.
i don't want to say anything negative
about that kennedy boy.
i'm sure he's a real nice fellow.
but do you really want that
spoiled rich son-of-a-bitch fuck
to be your next president?
think about it.
we'll cheer for you,
mr. vice president.
thank you, cecil.
let me ask you something,
in all candor,
as members of the negro community,
what are your biggest concerns?
now, come on now, boys.
don't be shy.
holloway, come on.
- well, since you asked, sir...
- i did.
the colored help gets paid almost
- is that right?
- yes, sir.
and it's very difficult for
the colored staff to be promoted.
i'll tell you what. when i'm president,
i'm gonna look into getting you boys
the raises and
the promotions you deserve.
that... that would be swell, sir.
- you got my word on that.
- thank you, sir.
now, you tell your people
to vote for me,
and that's exactly
what's gonna happen.
give that to somebody.
what do you mean, you don't
want to date nobody?
after all these guys
that come after you?
- girl, please. i'm just...
- like that one?
i'm talking about you and isaac.
now, come on,
tell me what happened.
y'all seemed happy.
see, i can't even have a normal
conversation with you, because...
- hey.
- you looking for love, boy?
that's what we call the lawson workshop,
the love school.
- is that what you're looking for?
- that's why i came to fisk.
me, too.
- i'm carol hammie.
- louis gaines.
come on. follow me.
you a country boy, ain't you?
he's a doctor.
what does your dad do?
he's in politics.
you were gonna need help
finding this place anyway.
...nor can you sustain it
over a month.
- really?
- this requires time, commitment,
dedication, discipline and focus.
and we are measuring our
accomplishments in waves, right?
this is not a fly-by-night affair.
this doesn't happen over a week.
this requires a fierce discipline,
which is what we've been discussing.
how do you measure these things?
we go back, and we look
at somebody like gandhi.
together, we are gonna study
and examine gandhi's techniques.
what has been so effective
in south africa, so effective in india,
for his own people and others,
and we're gonna employ it
right here, in nashville.
so we're gonna form an army.
you and i.
this army has one weapon.
that weapon is love.
now, i am of the... yes.
if our only weapon is love,
and then their weapons
are weapons,
- i mean, isn't that dangerous?
- oh, you can be killed.
if anybody's uncomfortable with that,
you know where the door is.
i understand that sounds
provocative, but it's true.
all right, kids.
it's show time.
gandhi has demonstrated for us
that the brown man,
in his native land, or anywhere
that he's being oppressed...
<i>...can pull himself out
of segregation</i>
with patience, with persistence,
with intelligence and thought,
with discipline...
<i>...and a bit
of a sense of humor.</i>
<i>you know y'all can't sit here.</i>
we would like to be served, please.
<i>this is unprecedented,
what we're talking about, </i>
<i>but it needs a patience
that none of us have ever seen.</i>
you can order food
in the colored section,
but i'm not gonna be
serving you here.
we are organized.
we have a leader with every group.
<i>we have lookouts
with pocket change</i>
<i>and the local phone numbers
for ambulances ready, </i>
<i>and when one wave comes
off that lunch counter, what follows?</i>
<i>a whole 'nother wave
of negro students</i>
<i>sitting at that lunch counter,
blowing their mind.</i>
we would like
to be served, please.
<i>now, who wants to role-play?</i>
jim, i need your help over here.
now, y'all know you're
not supposed to sit there.
- attack.
- get up, nigger! get up!
this is an experiment.
so do whatever it takes
to break their spirits.
- come on, get up, nigger.
- use the language.
i need to hear "nigger" coming
out of your mouth.
- i need to hear "coon."
- i don't feel comfortable saying that.
you came here to get yourself prepared
and to get her prepared.
so let me hear it now.
- nigger.
- louder.
say the words like you mean it.
- nigger.
- louder.
you are a nigger!
you need to be sitting
in the colored seating.
this is not for you,
you cannot be served here.
you need to do as you're told
and sit in your place.
- you are a nigger.
- make her believe it.
- i don't believe you.
- you're a nigger.
you know that's where
the colored people sit.
you see these people over here?
they're in their section over here.
you coon ass!
get up, you nigger!
if you want us to shop
in this establishment, make them go.
come on, robert, let's go.
nigger lover, get out!
- get up, monkey. get up!
- what is this?
are you listening to us?
this says "whites only."
get up, nigger. get up!
- coons here?
- what are you doing here?
- does it say "coons?"
- "whites only."
<i>you don't belong here with them.

a little too smooth for my money.

- out of jail, says he's back in school,
but i think he's doing
that freedom riding thing.
how's gloria doing
with that drinking?
she's hanging.

your direction that you move in.
- what you doing with my hangers?
- this is you, and this is me.
now, we seem like we don't fit at all.
we just crash into each other.

you align things properly,

everything kind of works out.

i got you.

he's in prison right now in birmingham

james told me
that dr. king told the president
that we would be going to the streets
down south for our right to vote.
- didn't you, baby?
- what?
didn't you tell me
that dr. king told the president
that we was going down south
for our right to vote?

got killed down there, trying to get
colored folks registered to vote.

louis to go down there.
that's what i was
trying to tell you.
you shouldn't have
sent him down there.
- i know.
- he is down there now,
and there ain't nothing
we can do about it.
the only reason
the president sent the fbi
is 'cause two of them were white.
- now who told you that?
- yeah, who told her that?
it was in one of them colored newspapers
from baltimore. that all right with you?
see, she getting smart now.
honey, you think the president
ought to do something
- about the voting rights bill?
- that ain't the trump.
president johnson
just passed the greatest piece
of civil rights legislation
since lincoln freed the slaves.
it's gonna be very difficult to
pass another bill anytime soon.
- that's it.
- you see how my wife quizzes me?
- i get it every day.
- only, you got to know
how much to say,
when you cross the line.
you deal with your woman,
i'll deal with mine.

what's going on over there.

seriously, how many of
your parents support the war?
well, my lord.
why do your parents support it?
we haven't spoken about it specifically,
i just know they do.
well, what do your daddy do?
he's a butler.
the black domestic play an
important role in our history.
i didn't tell you that
to make fun of me.
young brother, the black
domestic defy racial stereotypes
by being hardworking and trustworthy.
<i>he slowly
tears down racial hatred</i>
<i>with his example of a strong work ethic
and dignified character.</i>
now, while we perceive the butler
or the maid to be subservient,
in many ways, they are subversive,
without even knowing it.
- come in, cecil.
- afternoon, mr. warner.
thank you for seeing me.
since the colored...
...the black staff
does just as much work
as the white staff,
i believe that our salaries
should reflect our service, sir.
"black" staff?
i also feel
that we should have...
...opportunities of advancement.
no black houseman
has ever been promoted
to the engineer's office.
you're very well liked here, cecil.
but if you're unhappy
with your salary or position,
then i suggest you seek
employment elsewhere.
- with all due respect...
- don't let that martin luther king shit
fill your britches out.
just remember where i found you.
yes, sir.
excuse me.

the next step, which is politics.
so y'all going
to the white house now?
daddy, louis going
to the white house.
you know they ain't gonna
let you in there
with them nipples out.
maybe one, but not both of 'em.
shut up. nah, we're...
we're more grass roots.
one-on-one with the community.
although we have started
our own political party.
what's your party?
you like to party?
i like to party.
what's your party called?
the black panther party.
what kind of name is that?
what's that stand for?
we... provide free breakfast
for children,
free medical clinics, free clothing,
self-defense classes.
and why y'all need self-defense?
we ain't gettin' beat no more.
me and your daddy saw a
wonderful movie the other night.
reminded me so much of you.
oh, yeah?
what was the name
of that movie, honey?
<i>in the heat of the night.</i>
<i>in the heat... of the night,
with sidney poitier.</i>
lord, sidney poitier.
i love sidney poitier.
sidney poitier's a white man's fantasy
of what he wants us to be.
but his movies have him
fighting for equal rights.
only in a way that's acceptable
to the white status quo.
- ah.
- the brother can't act.
what are you talking about?
he just won the academy award.
he's breaking down barriers
for all of us.
by being white.
by acting white.
sidney poitier is nothing but
a rich uncle tom.
look at you.
all puffed up.
with your hat on your head.
coming in here,
saying whatever you want.
girlfriend belching at the table.
you don't even feel
you gotta go to school,
even though i gave you the money.
you need to go.
yeah, louis.
i need you to get out of my house.
- what?
- get the hell out of my house!
- what are you doing?
- get on out!
- he's gotta go!
- no, cecil, no!
- i can't take this no more!
- we ain't seen this boy!
we ain't seen this boy!
i'm gonna snatch the life
out of you, boy!
- now, everybody just sit down.
- i'm sorry, mr. butler,
i didn't mean to make
fun of your hero.
everything you are and
everything you have is...
...'cause of that butler.
now you take that trifling
low-class bitch...
...and get out of this house.
i like sidney poitier, daddy.
<i>what's that movie he did?
look who's coming to dinner?</i>
everything ain't a joke.
- carol came to dinner.
- hush, charlie.
<i>police took louis the next day.</i>
y'all gonna make me late for work.
unc, i'm sorry.
who else i'm supposed to call
to bail him out?
what they got him in for this time?
sit up!
louis said they
stopped him just because.
just because.
he said he wasn't going
to get beat no more, so...
...he got out the car
and he hit 'em back.
what about that little gal of his?
they put her in the hospital.
the hospital.
charlie.
this shit's gotta stop, man.
i'm late for work.
you tell louis i'm not his mama.
i want my money back.
you all right?
yeah, i'm all right.
thanks, uncle carter.
you need to take all this black
panther shit somewhere else.
now, i'm not them.
i want my money back, hear me?
- yes, sir.
- every dime.
- yes, sir.
- hey, unc... don't tell daddy.
how you avoid all that sex
in prison?
do they teach you that
with the panthers?
they teach you how to... to sit...
- she been drinking again?
- no. she's sober.
she ain't doing nothing but sewing
and feeding them damn fishes.
feed them more than she feed me.
you excited about
going back to howard?
excited about not going back.
- what?
- yeah.
i'm going to vietnam.
charlie, don't do this.
don't do this.
- this country treats us like dogs!
- and do what? don't do this?
you fight your country.
i want to fight for my country.
- i won't go to your funeral.
- good.
'cause i don't want you there
with all of that...
...black leather and latex,
shining and taking away the attention
off of my pretty face in my casket.
what do they call you now, louise?
- shut up.
- louise gaines.
charlie, shut up.
i want to know every goddamn
domestic policy decision right now,
and i want it on the table right now.
- ok.
- ok.
did you get
the memos we sent last week?
john and i strongly agree
that the time calls for...
a goddamn fly,
a goddamn fly in here.
- jesus christ.
- john and i both think
that the time calls for
a period of benign neglect.
- benign neglect.
- yes.
i like that. i like that.
<i>you know, the pigs in the
media describe us as terrorists.</i>
a terrorist is one who
terrorizes and frightens others.
we the ones getting terrorized.
how can we exist in, in peace,
when we scared to walk
down the street to the store?
all right, there's this whole black
power movement going on, right?
- right.
- what if we, um...
what if nixon promotes black power
to mean "black businesses"
and we find ways to support
black entrepreneurs, pass the buck
on desegregation to the courts.
push black enterprise
to win the 20 percent
of the votes it could swing our way.
- excellent, sir.
- absolutely.
you don't know if your ceiling gonna
cave in 'cause your slum lord
too busy running around
collecting rent checks.
but he won't fix your roof.
it's time we take a stand
against these injustices
that have plagued our community.
they take one of ours,
we taking two of theirs.
- that's right.
- it's been time.
we just need to make sure
that nixon black power
doesn't equate nixon
with the black panthers.
have you lost your mind, man?
did you read hoover's last memo on that?
- that's my point.
- goddamn terrifying.
no, no, no. i gave him the green light
to gut those sons of bitches.
- good.
- good. absolutely.
no, round 'em all up and
throw 'em down an elevator shaft.
i don't proclaim to know everything.
but i promise you...
...they'll always beware
of the nigger with a gun.
will there be anything else,
mr. president?
how many kids we got coming
to the breakfast tomorrow morning?
got about 25 to 30 coming.
twenty-five to 30 kids
will be able to go to school
and focus on their lessons.
'cause they don't want us
to be able to feed our kids.
they don't want us
to be able to protect ourselves.
what are we doing here?
thought this was going to be
our community service.
this is community service.
"someone kills one of ours,
we kill two of theirs?"
community protection.
are you ready to kill somebody, carol?
'cause i ain't.
i am.
did you ever love me, baby?
<i>today, a day after police
shot it out with the black panthers, </i>
<i>killing two of them,
they raided the apartment...</i>
<i>...the shooting of 26
panthers in the past year, </i>
<i>may represent a national campaign
by police to wipe out the panthers...</i>
<i>...the criminal reaction
of the occupants in shooting</i>
<i>at announced police officers, </i>
<i>emphasizes the extreme viciousness
of the black panther party.</i>
- hey, baby.
- hey.
- happy birthday.
- happy birthday to me, huh?
happy birthday to you.
right now, this is the present
i want, right here.
well, you want it right here?
mm-mm, you know right...
- right here?
- kids up... kids down...?
ain't no kids in the house no more.
hey, i made you a birthday cake.
i got all the cake
i want right here.
no, you crazy.
i got some champagne
cooling in the icebox.
and some ice cream, too.
get some ice cream.
you gonna be drinking with me?
you know i don't drink.
i don't drink.
just playing with you.
i just want to see you move
a little bit. go ahead.
<i>oh, my god!</i>
we get any mail
from charlie today?
no.
- no?
- haven't heard from charlie.
i know. i got an idea.
i think we should go
to shantay's tonight.
oh, no.
no, i'm too old for disco.
we not old. come on. we ain't old.
i just don't feel like
doing no disco.
our boys are gone.
it's just you and me.
you and me, we are free.
i forgot this. i forgot this.
now, look at us.
little happy birthday present.
i want you to go put it on, upstairs.
- put it on?
- yeah. go put it on.
- all right.
- make it snappy.
bring down my sewing kit,
'cause i need to do some alterations.
make it snappy!
hello.
hi. where are you?
where?
you should call me back,
because this is not a good time.
- he's home again.
- it fit!
- we gonna go on out tonight.
- where?
- he's home and...
- boy, you good, aren't you?
- you all right?
- who that?
call me back.
- ok?
- oh, it's louis.
he asking for some money?
hey, louis.
i didn't expect to hear
from you on my birthday.
you should feel
ashamed of yourself.
you're a grown-ass man calling
your mama, asking for money.
and guess what?
it's the butler's money.
it's uncle tom's money.
and he ain't giving
none out today.
bye.
i got it.
you got the wrong house.
it's the wrong house.
<i>vietnam took my boy, </i>
<i>and i didn't understand why we
were there in the first place.</i>
your father still alive, cecil?
no, sir.
my father died when i was a child.
is there anything else that you
would like, mr. president?
yeah. come sit.
sit down, you know?
there's been a lot of talk
of me resigning and...
...things of that nature,
but i just want you to know
it's never gonna happen.
i'm gonna come out of this thing
stronger than ever.
is there anything else
that you would like...
...mr. president?
louis is here, looking for you.
- got everybody all worried.
- well, i finished school.
i got my master's
in political science.
hey! that's what i'm talking about.
get that education.
there he is!
well, i'm gonna let you all to it.
ain't no need for that, carter.
- hey, dad.
- get out of here, louis.
- dad...
- i said leave.
keep doing what you doing.
thank you, uncle carter.
why you do that? huh?
that was wrong.
that boy's hurting, too. he's just
trying to get his act together.
he should be hurting, carter.
boy didn't even go
to his own brother's funeral.
he's full of shit is what he is.
he ain't doing nothing right.
he just got his master's!
what more you want him to do?
every gray hair i have
is 'cause of that boy.
<i>the years started to drift by, </i>
<i>but the pain in my heart
never went away.</i>
<i>through it all,
louis and i never spoke.</i>
<i>as we are a nation under god,
so i am sworn...</i>
<i>half of our
oil is now imported...</i>
<i>it is a crisis that strikes
at the very hear':</i>
<i>and soul and spirit
of our national will.</i>
<i>- i feel one coming now.
- not to worry.</i>
<i>two of you,
stay home until you feel better.</i>
<i>ok, barn, i'll stay.
but i ain't never gonna feel no better.</i>
<i>in our district alone,
we have nine percent unemployment.</i>
<i>in the country at large, 14 percent
are living below the poverty line.</i>
<i>sixty percent of those
are either black or hispanic.</i>
<i>now, if i'm voted to congress,
reducing those figures is gonna be</i>
one of my primary objectives.
yeah?
oh, hey.
thanks for getting back to me.
how much did he lose by?
really?
all right, then.
i appreciate it.
no, he didn't win.
i think you should call him.
right after charlie passed,
louis came over
and paid me a visit.
hmm.
he found me on the kitchen floor.
i had passed out.
drunk.
i'd gone to the bathroom
all over myself.
he's the one that cleaned me up.
and then he told me
i was the best mother
anybody could ever want.
i think, about now...
...he'd want to hear from his daddy.
i think you ought to call him.
mm-hm.
cecil?
cecil?
yes, sir, mr. president.
you stay there, i'm coming to you.
i... have a...
...secret mission for you.
yes, sir.
i like to send people
money when they write me
about their financial problems,
but my staff has been
trying to get me to stop.
you think you could
help me to keep this going?
absolutely, mr. president.
well, i appreciate
your help with this.
and, please, don't tell nancy.
of course not.
- morning, cecil.
- morning, mr. warner.
may i sit down?
i've been here
for over 20 years now.
for all that time,
the black help
has been paid a smaller salary
than the white help.
and i just don't think
that's right, mr. warner.
there are black housemen
who should be engineers by now.
they should've been promoted
years ago.
you think so?
i'm gonna have to be paid
the same as the white help,
or i'm gonna have to move on.
i guess you'll be moving on then.
i told the president
that you'd say that.
he told me to tell you
to take this up with him, personally.
excuse me.
i'm not comfortable
with all the foreign policy hawks
surrounding ronnie, jim.
we need more moderates on his staff.
and a summit with the russians.
ronnie has to meet
with them face to face
if we're ever
going to thaw this ice.
- cecil.
- yes, mrs. reagan?
we will talk, jim. yes.
yes, ma'am?
you're very popular around here.
everyone says you're the man
that got them raises and promotions.
- i had no idea.
- i wish i could take credit for that.
i'd like to invite you
to the state dinner next week.
- i'm gonna be there, mrs. reagan.
- no.
not as a... not as a butler, cecil.
i'm inviting you as a guest.
but the president prefers
for me to serve him personally.
don't you worry about, ronnie.
i'll take care of that.
so we'll see you next week.
you and your wife.
my wife?
it's... it's gloria, yes?
- yes, ma'am.
- yes.
hmm.
here's the entrance hall.
beautiful.
can i get you a glass
of champagne, mr. gaines?
- shut up.
- right.
ladies and gentlemen,
the president and first lady
of the united states.
<i>it was different sitting
at the table instead of serving it.</i>
<i>real different.</i>
<i>i could see the two faces
the butlers wore to survive.</i>
<i>and i knew i'd lived my life
with those same two faces.</i>
<i>gloria looked so happy,
but i didn't feel the same way.</i>
<i>i guess i wished we were there
for real instead of for show.</i>
i think that's bon appétit, everybody.
you black mother...
i want to make myself clear
on this issue.
if congress passes sanctions
against south africa,
i will be forced to
veto those sanctions.
well, mr. president, we feel
that that would be a major mistake.
the brutal repression
of south african black citizens
makes this no longer
a foreign policy issue,
but a united states racial issue.
we're senators
from your own party.
that's why we feel so comfortable
in letting you know
that south africa
is a human rights disaster.
black people are
being beaten, tortured,
gunned down
in the middle of the street.
americans see all this on tv,
they're horrified by apartheid.
i've made my decision.
mr. president, your reputation
as a world leader is at stake.
united states of america needs to be
on the right side of history
on the race issue.
i say again.
if congress passes this bill,
i will veto it.
period.
what? you reading now?
get up and do the dishes
'fore i shoot your little ass.
<i>nothing seemed right to me
after that state dinner.</i>
<i>got all confused.</i>
<i>they had started writing books</i>
<i>about everything louis
and his friends had done.</i>
<i>louis was never a criminal.</i>
<i>he was a hero, </i>
<i>fighting to save
the soul of our country.</i>
- would you like a cookie?
- thank you, sir.
- cookies.
- thank you.
cookie?
- thank you.
- thank you.
thank you.
cookie?
<i>i had always loved sewing.
but just felt different now.</i>
<i>i didn't know that an old man
could feel so lost.</i>
<i>that's how i felt.</i>
<i>that's how i felt.</i>
<i>americans always turned</i>
<i>a blind eye to what we'd done
to our own.</i>
<i>we look out to the world
and judge.</i>
<i>we hear about
the concentration camps, </i>
<i>but these camps went on
for 200 years</i>
<i>right here in america.</i>
buried my daddy right over there.
my mama would've been
right proud of me,
being with a man like you's.
taking such good care of me
all of these years.
i love you, cecil gaines.
i love you more, gloria.
are you sure about this?
yes, sir.
i just want to be the one
to tell you first, that's all.
but you're the best butler here.
you're like family, cecil.
been an honor serving you.
well, not just for me,
i'm sure i speak for all the presidents
when i say that you've
served your country well.
thank you, mr. president.
cecil?
this whole civil rights issue...
i sometimes fear i'm...
on the wrong side of it,
that i'm...
...just wrong.
sometimes i think i'm just
scared of what it really means.
but i'm trying not to be
so scared anymore.
<i>- who do we want to free?!
- mandela!</i>
when do we want him free?
- now!
- free mandela!
twenty years ago, we marched
in this country for our rights.
today, we march to free
the people of south africa.
yeah!
ronald reagan has attacked or dismantled
every civil rights program
that has ever been put in place.
- yeah!
- right!
aiding the oppression of black south
africans is absolutely consistent
with his policies on race issues.
am i right?
- am i right?
- yes!
hold on, hold on.
excuse me. steven?
where's steven?
- free mandela!
- free mandela, y'all!
free mandela!
free mandela!
free mandela! free mandela!
hi, dad.
hi, louis.
what are you doing here?
i came here to protest with you.
you'll get arrested, dad.
you'll lose your job.
i lost you.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry, son.
don't worry, dad, we'll be
out of here in a few hours.
who said i was worried?
<i>after going to jail,
i thought i'd seen it all.</i>
- you ok, daddy?
- yeah, no, no, no. i'm good.
<i>but i never imagined i'd see...</i>
<i>...a black man</i>
<i>be a real contender for
the president of the united states.</i>
here we go.
- it's that sweet corn.
- that corn look good.
<i>gloria and i would walk
to our polling place</i>
<i>every night to see where
we'd be voting for barack obama.</i>
<i>we'd just... stare at it, smile.</i>
- you done?
- pretty much.
good. time to go.
you done pretty good there.
thanks, honey.
how come louis' wife
named that child...
- ...shaquanda?
- now, don't start that again.
i ain't starting it, i just don't know
what kind of name that is.
i mean, really! shaquanda?
i think she done that just to spite me.
ain't nobody
done nothing to spite you.
yes, she did.
she a ugly little old girl, too.
that little pug nose.
- i hope she grow out of it.
- now, you need to stop that.
- you know that ain't right.
- don't you think
she look a little like
louis around the mouth?
i think... she look just like you.
- like me?
- yeah, so you need to...
...you need
to stop talking about her.
let me look at her again,
then, real good.
she do look a little bit like me.
she a pretty little thing.
i guess i can put up
with the name shaquanda.
i forgot where i put my bible.
- you know i need my bible.
- mm-hm.
- i think i left it in the bathroom.
- why is louis late?
boy gets elected to congress...
...and he ain't been on time
getting us to church ever since.
- i can't believe you still... fussing.
- he gonna be late to his own funeral.
are you still fussing
about louis?
he said he's gonna be here for us.
- go ahead, call him.
- i ain't calling louis.
i'm gonna get my purse and...
what'd you say? isaiah?
i see you got... your mark here.
i'm gonna fall all over myself.
baby, you need...
to move that to the other side.
baby?
honey?
you sleeping?
baby?
are you all right?
<i>...states will be closing, </i>
<i>and there are some big ones,
especially california, </i>
<i>the largest state
in the united states, </i>
<i>with 55 electoral votes.</i>
<i>hawaii, that's where
barack obama was born.</i>
<i>will be closing its polls.</i>
<i>idaho, oregon
and washington state, </i>
<i>and those states
have been going democratic</i>
<i>in presidential contests

louis!
<i>...a major projection at that point.</i>
<i>this is a moment that a lot of

mr. gaines.
i'm admiral rochon, the chief usher.
- nice to meet you, admiral.
- pleasure's all mine, sir.
i just wanted to tell you
what an honor it is to meet you, sir.
the honor is mine.
the president's so excited
to meet with you.
well...
...that's just fine, isn't it?
let me show
you the way.
i know the way.
<i>the heart of the question is, </i>
<i>whether all americans

<i>and equal opportunities.</i>
<i>it is the effort of american
negroes to secure for themselves</i>
<i>the full blessings of american life.</i>
<i>we will respond

<i>yes, we can.</i>
