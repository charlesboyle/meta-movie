<font color="#808080">(twig snaps)</font>
oh, whoa.
easy.
<font color="#808080">(breathing heavily)</font>
saw some turkeys
on the way here.
crossed right in front of me
like i wasn't even there.
- how rude of them.
- that's what happens.
you spend six days a week
working in the mines
and stupid birds start to
think they own these woods.
when's the tour leave?
couple hours.
well, let's go.
<font color="#808080">(turkeys gobbling)</font>
<font color="#808080">(gasps)</font>
<font color="#808080">(breathing heavily)</font>
hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- hey, whoa. you're okay.
- <font color="#808080">(screaming)</font>
<font color="#808080">(turkeys gobbling)</font>
you're okay. you're safe.
you're safe.
it's okay. you're here with me.
you're with me.
<font color="#808080">(panting)</font>
okay, okay.
i'm sorry.
oh, we... we should...
we should go.
<font color="#804040">katniss:</font> are you coming
to the train station?
i think you have enough people
saying goodbye without me there.
only a few i
actually care about.
it might be easier if i didn't.
it's only a few weeks.
i'll be back before
the snow melts.
yeah, a lot can happen
in a few weeks.
are we gonna do this again?
gale, it was an act.
yeah, it was a good one.
i did what i had
to do to survive.
if i didn't, i'd be dead.
i had to do that.
at least once.
<font color="#808080">(hisses)</font>
haymitch!
<font color="#808080">(bottles clinking)</font>
haymitch!
haymitch, wake up.
it's tour day.
haymitch.
<font color="#808080">(yelling)</font>
what are you doing?
cameras are gonna
be here in an hour.
if you wanted to be babied,
you should've asked peeta.
<font color="#804040">peeta:</font> asked me what?
<font color="#804040">haymitch:</font> asked you to wake me
without giving me pneumonia.
you are a strangely
dislikeable person.
but you do have your virtues.
would you like some
bread, katniss?
no, i ate at the
hob, but thank you.
you're welcome.
brr.
you two have a lot of warming
up to do before show time.
which is in an hour, so
take a bath, haymitch.
i just did.
did you have a good walk, dear?
- walk? i was just out...
- we have visitors.
miss everdeen. this way, please.
<font color="#808080">(door closes)</font>
such bravery.
such spirit.
such...
contempt.
president snow.
what an honor.
my dear, i think we can
make this so much simpler
if we agree not to
lie to each other.
what do you think?
yes, i think that
would save time.
sit down, please.
i have a problem, miss everdeen.
a problem that began the
moment you revealed
those poison berries
in the arena.
if that head gamemaker,
seneca crane,
had had any brains at all,
he would have blown you
to bits then and there.
but here you are.
i expect you can
guess where he is.
yes, i think so.
after that fiasco, there
was nothing left to do
but to let you play out
your little scenario.
and you were very good.
that whole love-crazed,
besotted schoolgirl routine.
impressive. truly.
you convinced the
people in the capitol.
unfortunately, not everyone
in the districts fell for it.
i mean, you can't know this,
but in several of them,
people viewed your little
trick with the berries
as an act of defiance.
not as an act of love.
and if a girl from
district 12 of all places
can defy the capitol and
walk away unharmed,
what is to prevent them
from doing the same?
what is to prevent, say,
an uprising?
that can lead to revolution.
and then, in a fraction of time,
the whole system collapses.
it must be a fragile system,
if it can be brought down
by just a few berries.
yes, it is, indeed.
but not in the way
you imagine it.
how should i imagine?
you should imagine thousands upon
thousands of your people dead.
this town of yours reduced
to ashes. imagine it gone.
made radioactive.
buried under dirt
as if it had never
existed, like district 13.
you fought very hard in
the games, miss everdeen.
but they were games.
would you like to
be in a real war?
no.
good. neither would i.
did your mother make these?
peeta.
oh. he's a lovely boy.
tell me.
at what point did he
realize the depth of your
indifference towards him?
- i'm not indifferent.
- don't lie!
you promised.
why don't you just kill me now?
i don't want to kill you.
i want us to be friends.
but if not friends, then allies.
what do i need to do?
when you and peeta are on tour,
you need to smile. you
need to be grateful.
but, above all,
you need to be madly,
prepared-to-end-it-all in love.
you think you can manage that?
yes.
yes, what?
i'll convince them.
no.
convince me.
for you, miss everdeen.
<font color="#808080">(monitor switches on)</font>
do convince me.
for the sake of your loved ones.
<font color="#808080">(door opens)</font>
<font color="#808080">(door closes)</font>
<font color="#804040">effie:</font> stop.
take it all in.
this is sacred ground.
history was made here.
oh.
you'll get used to the smell.
- hmm.
- <font color="#808080">(sighs)</font>
hello!
<font color="#808080">(gasps)</font> oh!
there she is. my
greatest triumph!
<font color="#804040">flavius:</font> our little superstar.
<font color="#808080">(all cooing)</font>
sweetie, we've missed you.
<font color="#804040">effie:</font> what a cute little house.
so quaint, isn't it?
of course, you've
heard about cinna?
what happened to cinna?
oh, dear, he's a fashion star.
you're his muse.
everyone in the capitol's
wearing him. everyone.
- everyone.
- well, not everyone.
oh!
<font color="#804040">katniss:</font> cinna!
<font color="#804040">prim:</font> katniss?
<font color="#804040">octavia:</font> katniss, is
this your sister?
oh, sweetie!
are you okay?
<font color="#804040">octavia:</font> oh, just adorable!
- yeah.
- ready to work?
- yeah.
- all right. good.
<font color="#808080">(show theme playing)</font>
welcome!
<font color="#808080">(audience cheering)</font>
last year, the 74th hunger games
brought us the greatest
love story of our time.
two brave young people,
against all odds
chose to die rather than
to lose each other.
as a nation, we
shared their agony.
but we had so little time
to revel in their joy.
<font color="#808080">(gasps)</font> it's time!
she's done, she's lovely.
we must feed the monster.
all right now.
<font color="#804040">caesar:</font> let's go to district 12
and find our
star-crossed lovers!
you're excited. you're in love.
big smiles for the camera
in three, two, one.
<font color="#804040">caesar:</font> there she is!
katniss everdeen!
the girl on fire.
<font color="#808080">(caesar chuckles)</font>
<font color="#808080">(audience cheering)</font>
and there he is! peeta mellark!
the baker's boy.
<font color="#808080">(caesar chuckles)</font>
<font color="#808080">(audience cheering)</font>
- ooh.
- <font color="#808080">(grunts)</font>
<font color="#804040">caesar:</font> uh-oh. whoa, oh.
trouble in paradise.
<font color="#808080">(chuckles)</font>
i hope they're all right.
um...
<font color="#808080">(clears throat)</font> ahem.
anyone at home?
<font color="#808080">(chuckles)</font> should we come back later?
sorry, caesar.
<font color="#808080">(chuckles)</font>
oh, please. it's all right.
it's your day.
it's your day. so
how's it going?
we're good.
that's it? that's all we get?
"we're good"?
so taciturn all of a sudden.
peeta, give me some details!
<font color="#808080">(audience cheering)</font>
yeah, things are, uh...
things are great here in 12.
thanks to the generosity
of the capitol,
we've never been closer.
- 25 yards, to be exact.
- <font color="#808080">(chuckles)</font>
<font color="#808080">(caesar laughs)</font>
fantastic!
we'll be checking
in with both of you
throughout the victory tour.
thank you so much,
katniss everdeen
and peeta mellark!
<font color="#808080">(audience cheering)</font>
- <font color="#808080">(cameras power down)</font>
- effie: wonderful!
everybody in motion. we
are out of here in 10.
that was nice acting.
you, too.
almost thought that
kiss was real.
<font color="#804040">effie:</font> come along, children,
we are on a schedule.
the train awaits!
fabulous food, fabulous wine,
the massages, spa treatments.
i told them
nothing but the best
for my two victors.
it all needs to be, uh...
fabulous?
exactly.
now, the schedule
is a bit of a bear.
but it's mostly
parties, celebrations,
adoring fans to greet you at
every stop along the way,
and then we wrap it
up in the capitol.
all you need to do is
give a few speeches,
wave to the crowds,
and enjoy your time
in the spotlight.
you've earned it.
what did you say?
katniss.
i said, "enjoy it, katniss,
you've earned it."
by killing people.
young lady...

- <font color="#808080">(computer beeps)</font>
<font color="#808080">(door locks)</font>
<font color="#808080">(door opens)</font>
i'm really not in the
mood for a lecture.
i'll apologize to effie later.
i thought you were haymitch.
you don't have to
apologize to anybody.
including me.
i know it's not fair of me
to hold you to things
you said in the games.
you saved us. i know that.
but i can't go on
acting for the cameras,
and then just ignoring
each other in real life.
so if you can stop looking
at me like i'm wounded,
then i can quit acting like it.
and then maybe we have a
shot at being friends.
i've never been very
good at friends.
for starters, it does help
when you know the person.
i hardly know anything about you
except that you're stubborn
and good with a bow.
that about sums me up.
no, there's more than that, you
just don't want to tell me.
it's like i said, i'm...
see, katniss, the way the whole
friend thing works is you have to
tell each other the deep stuff.
- the deep stuff?
- yeah.
uh-oh. like what?
like, uh...
what's your favorite color?
well, now you've
stepped over the line.
<font color="#808080">(chuckles)</font>
seriously, though, what is it?
green.
what's yours?
orange.
like effie's hair?
no.
<font color="#808080">(chuckles)</font> not that orange.
more, uh... more like a
sunset kind of orange.
<font color="#808080">(electricity crackling)</font>
did you see that?
what?
whoa.
<font color="#808080">(scoffs)</font> well, i never.
this is not very festive.
the mayor will make some
introductory remarks.
and then you just have
to say a few words.
it's customary, of course,
to give a brief eulogy
to the district's
fallen tributes.
for 11, that's thresh and rue.
here are the speeches.
i can do the talking
if you want.
thank you.
<font color="#804040">mayor:</font> ladies and gentlemen,
the victors of the
katniss everdeen
and peeta mellark!
<font color="#804040">effie:</font> smile, smile,
smile, smile.
stand up straight.
you're on camera.
<font color="#808080">(mild applause)</font>
<font color="#808080">(indistinct chattering on radio)</font>
thank you.
we're honored to be
here with you today.
and to be with the families
of your fallen tributes.
<font color="#804040">effie:</font> <font color="#808080">(gasps)</font> he put down the cards.
-<font color="#804040">peeta:</font> though they fought...
- <font color="#808080">(shushes)</font>
- ...and lived with honor...
- why do i bother?
and dignity until the end,
both thresh and rue
were so young.
but our lives aren't
just measured in years.
they're measured in the lives
of people we touch around us.
for myself,
for katniss,
we know that without rue
and without thresh,
we wouldn't be
standing here today.
so in recognition of that,
knowing that it in no way
can make up for your loss,
we'd like to donate one
month of our winnings
to the families of the
tributes, every year,
for the rest of our lives.
- <font color="#808080">(applause)</font>
- oh, shit.
<font color="#808080">(stutters)</font> can he do that?
he can't. but he did.
<font color="#808080">(sighs)</font> why doesn't
he just stick to the cards?
<font color="#804040">peeta:</font> thank you.
i just wanted to say that
i didn't know thresh. i
only spoke to him once.
he could have killed me,
but instead he showed me mercy.
that's a debt i'll never
be able to repay.
i did know rue.
she wasn't just my ally,
she was my friend.
i see her in the flowers that
grow in the meadow by my house.
i hear her in a mockingjay song.
i see her in my sister prim.
she was too young,
too gentle.
<font color="#808080">(sniffling)</font>
and i couldn't save her.
i'm sorry.

no! leave him alone!

you! no, no, no!
- come here! stop it!
- <font color="#808080">(shouting indistinctly)</font>
stop it! stop!
- what did i do?
- <font color="#808080">(shushes)</font>
come on.
shut up.
<font color="#804040">effie:</font> in all my years,
i've never seen...
<font color="#808080">(clamoring outside continues)</font>
you two have a very simple task.
i never meant for
anyone to get killed.
he has to know that.
what are you talking about?
who has to know what?
snow. he came to see me.
he's worried about rebellion
in the districts.
he thinks that they don't
believe our love story.
<font color="#804040">haymitch:</font> so he wants you
to make them believe it?
- to calm things down.
- peeta: you know, katniss,
you shoulda told me that
before i went out there,
and tried to give these
people the money.
i'm sorry. i didn't
know what to do.
he threatened to kill my family.
well, i have family, too.
okay? people that i
need to protect.
what about them?
who protects them?
katniss, what were you thinking?
i was thinking about rue.
haymitch, please...
please, just help me
get through this trip.
please, just help us
get through this.
this trip? girl, wake up.
<font color="#808080">(snaps fingers)</font>
this trip doesn't end
when you get back home.
you never get off this train.
you two are mentors now.
that means that every year,
they're gonna drag you out,
and broadcast the details
of your romance.
every year, your private
life becomes theirs.
from now on, your job
is to be a distraction.
so people forget what
the real problems are.
- so what do we do?
- haymitch: you're gonna smile.
you're gonna read the cards
that effie gives you.
and you're gonna live
happily ever after.
think you can do that?
huh?
yeah?
come here.
you're gonna be okay. i promise.
<font color="#804040">peeta:</font> katniss and i want to
share with you our victory.
and our gratitude to the capitol
for bringing us together.
it was the bond of love,
forged in the
crucible of the games
that was our greatest prize.
for it is love and true love
that allows us all to
bear our hardships.
that mends the heart
and banishes loneliness and
gives meaning to our lives.
<font color="#804040">katniss:</font> we also want to share with
you the sorrows of your losses.
the tributes of this...
the tributes of this district
were brave and noble warriors.
they brought honor
to their families
and pride to their people.
we are all of us united,
both victors and vanquished,
in serving a common purpose.
<font color="#808080">(cheering and applause)</font>
thank you.
one day, i'm gonna volunteer.
just like you did.
<font color="#808080">(screaming)</font>
<font color="#808080">(gasping)</font>
it was just a dream. i'm sorry.
it's okay. i get 'em, too.
goodnight.
peeta.
will you stay with me?
yeah.
always.
<font color="#804040">katniss:</font> we are
all of us united,
both victors and vanquished,
in serving a common purpose.
the power and glory
- of the capitol.
- man: put down the cards!
tell us what you really think!
panem today. panem tomorrow.
panem forever.
<font color="#808080">(crowd clamoring)</font>
your hair looks lovely, darling.
when did you start
wearing it like that?
everyone at school wears
it like this now, grandpa.
snow is watching us.
if he wants you to
pacify the districts,
i promise you, he's not happy.
instead of being in love,
you two sound like
you're reciting
from a drilling manual.
you try reading that stuff
that effie writes us.
tell that to president snow when
you see him two days from now.
i'm open to suggestions.
we could get married.
that's not helping.
i'm serious.
if, like you said, we're
on this train forever,
it's gonna happen eventually.
why not now?
<font color="#808080">(chuckles)</font>
it does make a statement.
i'll give you that.
yeah, sure. let's do it.
<font color="#804040">caesar:</font> just when you thought
things couldn't get more exciting
going into a very
special quarter quell,
our two lethal lovers...

- <font color="#808080">(laughing)</font>
- <font color="#808080">(audience laughs)</font>
from district 12
have surprised us with a new
twist in their love affair.
let's take a look.
-<font color="#804040">audience:</font> aw...
- <font color="#808080">(applause)</font>
a fairy tale ending for
two star-crossed lovers.
that's beautiful. beautiful.
and then tonight,
the tour that began in the
hollows of district 12
will end where?
the presidential palace.
the party of the year.
eyes bright. chins up.
smiles on.
i'm talking to you, katniss.
now, there'll be photographers.
interviews.
everyone will be here
to celebrate you.
my victors.
<font color="#808080">(sighs)</font>
breathe it all in, children.
this is all for you.
it's cozy.
attitude.
<font color="#808080">(exhales)</font>
come, come.
<font color="#808080">(all cheering)</font>
come along.
excuse us, excuse us.
come, come.
hold hands.
and the library. all mahogany.
hello, hello!
not yet, not yet. no, no, no.
<font color="#808080">(giggles)</font>
ooh, curtains!
everybody who's anybody is here.
and they all want to meet you.
flavius! octavia!
<font color="#808080">(regal music playing)</font>
try one of these.
they are divine.
no, i can't eat another thing.
- here.
- peeta: what's this?
<font color="#804040">flavius:</font> it's for
when you're full.
it makes you sick.
so you can go on eating.
how else could you
taste everything?
i think it's time for a dance.
katniss?
<font color="#808080">(waltz playing)</font>
people are starving in 12.
here, they're just throwing
it up to stuff more in.
katniss? peeta.
this is plutarch heavensbee.
head gamemaker.
successor to seneca crane.
that's a tough act to follow.
peeta!
<font color="#808080">(both laugh)</font>
may i?
please.
so how do you like the party?
it's a little overwhelming.
it's appalling.
still, if you abandon your
moral judgment, it can be fun.
so are you having fun?
i'm the head gamemaker.
fun is my job.
thought that was what happened
to seneca crane. too much fun.
seneca decided to
quit breathing.
decided.
it was that or poison berries.
being head gamemaker
has never been
the most secure
job in the world.
then why are you here?
same reason as you.
i volunteered.
why?
ambition.
the chance to make the
games mean something.
the games don't mean anything.
they only mean to scare us.
well, maybe it was you who
inspired me to come back.
<font color="#808080">(orchestral music playing)</font>
- <font color="#808080">(guests cheering)</font>
- ah!
the presidential welcome.
i'm sure we'll meet again.
katniss, come. the
president awaits.
you think we convinced him?
i'm not sure what
else we can do.
<font color="#808080">(crowd cheering)</font>
tonight,
on this, the last
day of their tour,
i want to welcome
our two victors.
two young people who
embody our ideals
of strength and valor.
and i, personally, want
to congratulate them
on the announcement
of their engagement.
<font color="#808080">(all cheering)</font>
your love has inspired us.
and i know it will
go on inspiring us
every day
for as long as you may live.
<font color="#808080">(crowd cheering)</font>
<font color="#808080">(explosions)</font>
<font color="#808080">(people clamoring on monitor)</font>
<font color="#804040">snow:</font> look at them.
she's not who they think she is.
she's not a leader.
she just wants to save her own
skin. it's as simple as that.
i think that's true.
but she's become a beacon
of hope for the rebellion.
and she has to be eliminated.
i agree she should die.
but in the right way.
at the right time.
it's moves and countermoves.
and it's all we gotta look at.
katniss everdeen is a symbol.
their mockingjay.
they think she's one of them.
we need to show that
she's one of us.
we don't need to destroy her.
just the image.
then we let the
people do the rest.
what do you propose?
shut down the black markets.
take away what little they have.
then double the amount of
floggings and executions.
put them on tv.
broadcast them live.
sow fear. more fear.
it won't work. fear does not
work as long as they have hope.
and katniss everdeen
is giving them hope.
she's engaged.
make everything about that.
what kinda dress is she
gonna wear? floggings.
what's the cake gonna look like?
executions.
who's gonna be there? fear.
blanket coverage. shove
it in their faces.
show them that she
is one of us now.
<font color="#808080">(chuckles)</font> they're gonna
hate her so much,
they might just
kill her for you.
brilliant.
when did you...
we need to talk.
<font color="#808080">(sighs)</font>
where are we gonna run away?
into the woods. like we
always talked about.
if we leave right now,
we can be far away
from here by tonight.
yeah, who's "we"?
you, me and your fiance?
it's not just me
and peeta anymore.
snow threatened to
have you killed.
anyone else?
well, he didn't exactly
give me a copy of the list
but a good guess, it includes
both of our families.
unless what? you and
peeta get married?
unless nothing now.
gale, we can do it.
you said yourself that we could
do it the morning of the reaping.
<font color="#808080">(sighs)</font>
what do you say now?
do you love me?
gale, you know how
i feel about you.
but i can't think about
anyone that way right now.
the only thing that
i can think about
every day, every waking moment
since the reaping,
is how afraid i am.
there's no room for
anything else.
but maybe, if we got
away from here,
if we went somewhere safe,
it could be different.
i could be different.
you think maybe the
president's bluffing?
he's not bluffing.
not with what's going
on in the districts.
what do you mean?
what did you see?
there were people fighting
in the streets, and fires,
and peacekeepers were

but the people were...
what? the people were what?
they were fighting back.
it's happening.
it's finally happening.
i should've just eaten
the berries in the arena
and died like i was supposed to.
then everything would be back to
normal and everyone would be safe.
safe for what?
to starve? work like slaves?
send their kids to the reaping?
you haven't hurt
people, katniss.
you've given them
an opportunity.
they just have to be
brave enough to take it.
there's already talk in the
mines. people wanna fight.
we have to go, gale,
before they kill us.
they will kill us.
what about the other families?
huh?
the ones who stay.
what happens to them?
people are looking
to you, katniss.
i don't want anyone
looking to me.
i can't help them.
<font color="#808080">(vehicles approaching)</font>
you do what you want.
i'm staying here.

no, you don't want to shoot her.
how about i shoot both of you?
look, commander,
you're new here.
trust me, i'm
trying to help you.
i'm haymitch.
you recognize her?
katniss everdeen.
darling of the capitol.
<font color="#808080">(breathing heavily)</font>
she interfered with
a peacekeeper.
i never said she was smart.
<font color="#808080">(chuckles)</font>
look, you already got a
couple of lashes in, right?
that's not good enough.
she's an agitator.
easy, easy.
look...
you're sure snow wants
three dead victors here?
because that's what
we're looking at.
it's bad enough that
you marked up her face
on the eve of the big wedding.
let it go. and we will, too.
all right.
okay.
but next time, it's
the firing squad.
excellent idea.
i don't care who she is.
clear the square!
you're all under curfew.
anyone out after dark
will be shot on sight.
get 'em outta here.
it's gale.
get him here.

<font color="#804040">mrs. everdeen:</font> make a snow coat.
peeta, get the snow.
i'll grind the herbs.
<font color="#808080">(groaning loudly)</font>
what is that?
that's hurting him.
he needs morphling.
<font color="#804040">katniss:</font> it's okay.

oh, god.

<font color="#808080">(sighs)</font>
hey, catnip.
hey.
thought you'd be gone by now.
i'm not going anywhere.
i'm gonna stay right here.
'cause all kinds of trouble.
me, too.
hey.
you wanna get some rest?
i can look after
him for a while.
i'm gonna go get him more snow.
<font color="#808080">(door closes)</font>
hey.
how's your eye?
it's not my eye
that's bothering me.
how can we live like this?
how can anybody live like this?
it's not living, but...
since the last games,
something is different.
i can see it.
what can you see?
hope.
you understand that whatever i
do comes back to you and mom.
i don't want you to get hurt.
you don't have to protect me.
or mom.
we're with you.
i love you.
i love you, too.
<font color="#804040">plutarch:</font> the broadcast
cut out here.
before any of the
excitement happened.
how many people saw it?
hard to say. there was
a five second delay,
but it happened fast.
if you cannot contain
katniss everdeen,
then i will have
to terminate her.
i understand that.
and not just her.
her entire species has
to be eliminated.
her species, sir?
the other victors.
now, because of her,
they all pose a threat.
because of her,
they all think
they're invincible.
whatever game you
think you're playing,
those out there are not
playing it with you.
there's a way we can still win.
it's what we gamemakers
like to call "a wrinkle."
<font color="#808080">(crowd cheering)</font>
ladies and gentlemen,
this is the 75th year
of the hunger games.
and it was written in the
charter of the games
that every 25 years, there
would be a quarter quell
to keep fresh for
each new generation
the memory of those who died
in the uprising
against the capitol.
each quarter quell
is distinguished
by games of a special
significance.
and now on this,
the 75th anniversary of our
defeat of the rebellion,
we celebrate the
<font color="#808080">(crowd cheering)</font>
as a reminder that
even the strongest
cannot overcome the
power of the capitol.
on this, the 3rd
quarter quell games,
the male and female tributes
are to be reaped
from the existing pool of
victors in each district.
<font color="#808080">(audience clamoring)</font>
<font color="#804040">mrs. everdeen:</font> no!
who does he mean?
<font color="#804040">snow:</font> victors shall present
themselves on reaping day
- regardless of age...
- prim: katniss...
- <font color="#808080">(mrs. everdeen sobbing)</font>
- ...state of health

- <font color="#808080">(yells)</font>
<font color="#808080">(panting)</font>
no.
peeta.
<font color="#808080">(bottles clinking)</font>
ah. there she is.
finally did the math, huh?
and you've come to, what?
ask me to... die?
i'm here to drink.
oh.
finally, something i
can help you with.
what's it say that peeta
was here 45 minutes ago
begging to save your life and
you only just now show up?
it means we have to save him.
you could live 100 lifetimes
and never deserve that boy.
come on, haymitch.
nobody decent ever
wins the games.
nobody ever wins the games.
period.
there are survivors.
there's no winners.
peeta has to survive.
we have to do whatever
it takes to save him.
<font color="#808080">(sighs)</font>
all right, if...
if they call his name, i'll
volunteer in his place.
haymitch, thank you.
but they call my name
and peeta volunteers,
there's nothing i can do.
you can help him in the arena.
like you did for me.
ah...
i think these games are
gonna be different.
i don't care. do
whatever you can.
peeta lives. not me.
promise me.
okay.
<font color="#808080">(softly)</font> we should've
gone when you said.
<font color="#804040">effie:</font> welcome.
welcome.
as we celebrate the
and 3rd quarter quell
of the hunger games.
as always,
ladies first.
the female tribute
from district 12,
katniss everdeen.
wonderful.
<font color="#808080">(clears throat)</font>
and now for the men.
the male tribute
from district 12.
<font color="#808080">(sighs)</font> haymitch abernathy.
i volunteer as tribute.
i can't let you do that.
you can't stop me.
- peeta.
- let go.
very well.
the tributes from district 12.
katniss everdeen
and peeta mellark.
well, all that remains is...
oh, no. but, but, but...
katniss!
- i get to say goodbye.
- katniss!
new plan. straight to the train.
no, i have to say goodbye.
katniss!
no.
goodbye!
<font color="#804040">effie:</font> all right.
<font color="#808080">(clears throat)</font>
before we begin,
i've had a thought.
you don't say?
katniss has her gold
mockingjay pin.
i have my hair.
i'm going to get you two
boys something gold.
uh... why is that?
a token.
show them we are a team.
and they can't just...
thank you.
all right. now...
<font color="#808080">(exhales)</font>
everything will be different,
because it's a quarter quell.
the capitol has
spared no expense.
a new training center.
new tribute living quarters.
and of course, a
very special arena.
but this year you'll be
facing other victors.
capitol favorites.
smart, cunning, skilled.
and they all know one another.
you two are the outsiders.
i want you guys to forget
everything you think you
know about the games.
last year was child's play.
this year, you're dealing
with all experienced killers.
all right. what does
that mean for us?
that means you're gonna
have to have some allies.
okay. i think that if...
whoop. you're not the problem.
no.
look, you're starting
at a disadvantage.
most of these people have
been friends for years.
that just puts us higher
on their kill list.
do it your own way, but
i know these people.
you go it alone,
their first move is gonna
be to hunt you down.
both of you.
katniss, come on.
how could any of us
even trust each other?
it's not about trust.
it's about staying alive.
cashmere and gloss.
brother and sister.
district 1.
they won back-to-back games.
capitol favorites.
lots of sponsors.
they will be lethal.
and the other half
of the career pack,
brutus and enobaria.
what's with her teeth?
she had them filed into fangs so she
could rip people's throats out.
she's committed.
i'll give her that.
wiress and beetee. not
fighters, but brilliant.
and weird. real tech-savvy.
he won his games
by electrocuting
six tributes at once.
the morphlings. masters
of camouflage.
basically, won their games by hiding
until everyone else was dead.
self-medicating ever since.
which i applaud.
not a threat.
finnick odair, right?
yes. he won his games at 14.
youngest ever.
- extremely humble.
- you're kidding.
yes, i'm kidding.
he's a peacock.
a total preener.
but he's the capitol darling.
they love him here.
charming, smart,
and very skilled at combat.
especially in water.
what about weaknesses?
one. mags.
she volunteered for annie.
mags was his mentor and
basically raised him.
if he's trying to protect her
in any way, it exposes him.
a guy like that has to know
she's not gonna make it.
i bet when it really comes down
to it, he won't protect her.
well, katniss, i just hope when
she goes, she goes quickly.
she's actually a wonderful lady.
<font color="#808080">(crowd cheering in distance)</font>
how'd we get here, huh?
<font color="#804040">finnick:</font> katniss.
hello, finnick.
do you want a sugar cube?
i mean, it's supposed to
be for the horses, but...
i mean, who cares
about them, right?
they got years to eat
sugar, whereas you and i...
well, if we see something
sweet, we better grab it.
no thanks. but i would love to
borrow that outfit someday.
you look pretty
terrifying in that getup.
what happened to the pretty
little girl dresses?
i outgrew them.
you certainly did.
shame about this quell thing.
now, you...
you could've made out like
a bandit in the capitol.
jewels, money,
anything you wanted.
well, i don't like jewels and i
have more money than i need, so...
what did you do with all
your wealth, anyway?
i haven't dealt in anything
as common as money in years.
then how do people pay for the
pleasure of your company?
with secrets.
what about you, girl on fire?
any secrets worth my time?
i'm an open book.
everybody always seems
to know my secrets
before i know them myself.
unfortunately, i
think that's true.
i'm sorry you had to
cancel your wedding.
i know how devastating
that must be for you.
have a good day.
<font color="#808080">(snickers)</font>
- peeta.
- finnick.
what'd he want?
to know all my secrets.
<font color="#808080">(chuckles)</font>
hmm. he'll have to get in line.
<font color="#804040">male announcer:</font> <font color="#808080">(over pa)</font>

no waving and
smiling, this time.
i want you to look
straight ahead

that should be easy.

special friends of mine.
this is seeder. and chaff.
from district 11.
<font color="#804040">haymitch:</font> uh...
<font color="#808080">(both chuckle)</font>
he's very friendly.
don't invite him over. he'll
drink up your liquor.
i'll see you guys soon.
let's get some of
that makeup off you
and talk about these
other tributes.
these tributes are crazy.
no, not all of 'em.
he's a good guy.
carry on.
<font color="#808080">(door opens)</font>
you guys look amazing.
thank you.
my stylist is such an idiot.
district 7. lumber. trees. ugh!
i'd love to put my
ax in her face.
so what do you think?
now that the whole world
wants to sleep with you?
<font color="#808080">(scoffs)</font> i don't think
that the whole world...
i wasn't talking to you.
okay.
will you unzip?
yeah.
<font color="#808080">(unzipping)</font>
<font color="#808080">(sighs)</font>
thanks. let's do
it again sometime.
thank you.
johanna mason, district 7.
remember, katniss, today's
about making allies.
<font color="#808080">(man retching)</font>
so far i'm not overwhelmed
by our choices.
i guess we just try to figure
out who we trust least
and work our way
backwards from there.

you see it?
looks like glass.
to separate us and them.
probably my fault.
i shot an arrow at
them last year.
uh-huh... electromagnetic.
how can you tell?
<font color="#808080">(both chuckling)</font>
is it... is it obvious
or something?
<font color="#808080">(continues chuckling)</font>
"is it obvious?"
they might as well have a sign.
look around you.
all the holograms, the lights,
every now and then they flicker.
why?
because the force field is
taking up too much energy.
there's always a
flaw in the system.
<font color="#804040">katniss:</font> that's beautiful.
i saw you volunteer
for that young girl.
it was really brave.
prim is my sister.
if you, um...
if you teach me how to make a fishhook
like that i could teach you how to hunt.
yes, yes.
<font color="#804040">katniss:</font> do you
wanna try with me?
- okay.

"nuts" and "volts."

i made a few alterations.
<font color="#804040">caesar:</font> you two made the

we will miss more.
you or your brain.

- finnick...
i understand that
you have a message
for somebody out there.
a special somebody.
<font color="#808080">(chuckles)</font>
can we hear it?
my love,
you have my heart
for all eternity
and if...
if i die in that arena,
my last thought will
be of your lips.
we have seen a lot of
tears here tonight.
but i see no tears
in johanna's eyes.
johanna, you are angry.
- tell me why.
- <font color="#808080">(scoffs)</font>
well, yes, i'm angry.
you know, i'm getting
totally screwed over here.
- uh-huh. - the deal was that
if i win the hunger games,
i get to live the rest
of my life in peace.
- mmm-hmm. - but now you
want to kill me again.
<font color="#808080">(chuckles humorlessly)</font>

you look fabulous. doesn't she?
<font color="#808080">(laughs)</font>

whoo, whoo, whoo.
now, katniss,
this is
a very big and very
emotional night
for all of us. wouldn't you say?
oh, don't go crying
on me now, caesar.
i can't make any promises.
you know me.
<font color="#808080">(chuckles)</font> you know i wouldn't
believe you, even if you did.
<font color="#808080">(laughs)</font> i love her!
the girl on fire is so cheeky.
<font color="#808080">(laughs)</font>
but, katniss,
on a more serious note.
i think we're all here
a little disappointed,
more than a little disappointed,
that a certain wedding
did not take place.
aren't we, folks?
<font color="#804040">audience:</font> aw...
alas. but am i
correct in assuming
that this is the gown
that you would have worn
on that day, yes or no?
yes, president snow thought
everyone would want to see it.

usual, was right.

<font color="#808080">(stammers)</font>
it's got feathers. it's like a bird.
it's like a, um...
like a mockingjay.
your stylist certainly has
outdone himself this time,
hasn't he? what theatricality!
cinna!
take a bow.
<font color="#808080">(caesar chuckles)</font>
but, peeta,
the wedding, the
marriage, never to be?
well, actually, we got married.
- <font color="#808080">(audience gasps)</font>
- in secret.
<font color="#804040">caesar:</font> a secret wedding?
all right. do tell.
we... we want our
love to be eternal.
- of course.
- <font color="#808080">(audience sighing)</font>
<font color="#804040">peeta:</font> you know, katniss and i,
we've been luckier than most.
and i wouldn't have
any regrets at all
if it weren't...
if...
if it weren't for what? what?
<font color="#808080">(audience murmuring)</font>
if it weren't for the baby.
<font color="#808080">(audience clamoring excitedly)</font>
<font color="#804040">caesar:</font> all right. this is news!

<font color="#808080">(shouting indistinctly)</font>

news to all of us.
<font color="#804040">man 1:</font> call off the games!
all right.
<font color="#808080">(whispering indistinctly)</font>
- let's, uh...
- man 2: stop the games!
everybody, calm down.
it's a great night.
a great night.
this is news to all of us.
all right, all right, all right.
we're going to find out
what we do about this.
<font color="#808080">(caesar chuckles)</font>
<font color="#808080">(audience clamoring)</font>
<font color="#804040">woman:</font> cancel the games!
<font color="#804040">man 3:</font> stop the games!
<font color="#808080">(audience clamoring)</font>
there's no way they'll cancel.
they can't.
baby bomb was a
stroke of genius.
unfortunately, games
are still on.
this is goodbye, for now.
presents for the boys.
what is this?
your token. remember?
hair for me. pin for katniss.
gold bangle for you.
and for peeta, the medallion
that we talked about.
thank you, effie.
we're a team. aren't we?
and i'm so proud of my victors.
so proud.
you're so...
well, you both deserved
so much better.
thank you, effie.
i am truly sorry.
<font color="#808080">(sobbing)</font>
thank you, haymitch.
for everything.
any last advice?
stay alive.
haymitch, wait.
<font color="#808080">(whispers)</font> remember our deal.
do whatever it takes
to keep him alive.
promise me.
okay.
katniss, when you're
in the arena,
remember who the real enemy is.
i don't want to be with
anyone else in there.
just you.
if that's what you want.
that's what i want.
<font color="#808080">(knocking on door)</font>
i'll see you soon.
<font color="#808080">(door opens)</font>
<font color="#804040">man:</font> your tracker.
<font color="#808080">(whirring)</font>
look at this. they're
holding hands.
i want them dead.
be patient.
they're holding hands now,
but the minute the gun goes
off, it'll be a bloodbath.
and the whole idea of
revolution will be discredited.
and the idea of her?
the idea of the mockingjay?
the more allies she betrays,
the more friends she kills,
the more she reveals
her true self.
as long as it ends with
her picture in the sky
and the sound of cannon.
and it shall.
it better.
let's watch her get her
hands dirty first.
hmm.
excuse me.
let's start.

<font color="#808080">(chuckles)</font>
you think that's funny?
every time that cannon goes
off, it's music to my ears.
i don't care about any of them.
good to hear.
want to face the

what would haymitch say?
haymitch isn't here.
let's keep moving.

can take first watch.

honey, that thing i did
back there for peeta?
that was called
"saving his life."
if i wanted to kill either of
you, i would've done it by now.
why don't you get some rest?
i'll take the first watch.
just for a little bit.

<font color="#804040">johanna:</font> well...
i got 'em out.
we were all the way
deep into the jungle
where i thought it
was gonna be safe.
that's when the rain started.
i thought it was water.
it turned out to be blood.
- tick tock.
- hot, thick blood.
- it was coming down.
- tick tock.
<font color="#804040">johanna:</font> it was choking us.
<font color="#808080">(scoffs)</font>
we were stumbling around,
gagging on it, blind.
<font color="#804040">wiress:</font> tick tock.
that's when blight
hit the force field.
- <font color="#808080">(exhales)</font>
- wiress: tick tock. tick tock.
he wasn't much, but
he was from home.
tick tock.
-<font color="#804040">wiress:</font> tick tock.
- what's wrong with her?
- she's in shock.
- wiress: tick tock.
dehydration isn't helping.
do you have fresh water?
-<font color="#804040">katniss:</font> we can get some.
- just...
tick tock.
listen. stop it!
- hey! lay off her!
- just sit down!
<font color="#804040">johanna:</font> hey! what
are you doing?
- hey, hey, hey!
- i got them out for you!
<font color="#804040">finnick:</font> it's okay. it's okay.

come on, let's get
you cleaned up.
tick tock.
- tick tock.
- tick tock!
tick tock, okay.
<font color="#804040">katniss:</font> what does
beetee have there?
the coil? it's
some kind of wire.
did he get it from
the cornucopia?
took a knife in the
back to get it.
<font color="#808080">(gasps)</font>
- tick tock! tick tock!
- johanna: all right.
i can't.
just... have fun with "nuts."
<font color="#808080">(electricity crackling)</font>
<font color="#808080">(thunder rumbling)</font>
tick tock.
it's a clock.
my god, it's a clock!
wiress, you're a genius.
you're a genius!
<font color="#804040">katniss:</font> this entire arena seems
to be laid out like a clock
with a new threat every hour,
but they stay only
within their wedge.
it all starts with
the lightning.
then the blood rain,
fog, monkeys.
that's the first four hours.
at 10:00, that big wave
hits from over there.
wiress, you're a genius.
look, the tail points to 12.
that's where the lightning
strikes at noon and midnight.
strikes where?
that big tree.
good.
"hickory dickory dock. the
mouse ran up the clock."
"the clock struck one,
the mouse ran down."
"hickory dickory dock."
<font color="#808080">(wiress continues reciting rhyme)</font>
so 12:00 to 1:00, lightning.
then 1:00 to 2:00 is blood.
then fog. and then monkeys.
"hickory dickory dock. the
dog barked at the clock."
"the clock struck 3:00..."
<font color="#804040">katniss:</font> and then 10:00
to 11:00, the wave.
what about everything else?
did you guys see anything?
"hickory dickory dock."
- nothing but blood.
- it doesn't matter.
as long as we steer clear of whichever
sector is active, we'll be safe.
<font color="#804040">finnick:</font> yeah.

need and get off the bloody island.
so besides brutus and
enobaria, who's left?
maybe chaff. just those three.
they know they're outnumbered.
i doubt they'll attack again.
we're safe here on the beach.

we hunt 'em down?

- no, no. prim's okay.
are you okay?
yeah, i'm fine. i'm fine.
okay? they won't touch prim.
all right?
<font color="#804040">johanna:</font> your fiance's right. the
whole country loves your sister.
if they tortured her or
did anything to her,
forget the districts,
there would be riots
in the damn capitol.
<font color="#808080">(loudly)</font> hey, how does
that sound, snow?
what if we... what if we
set your backyard on fire?
you know, you can't put
everybody in here.
what?
they can't hurt me.
there's no one left that i love.
<font color="#808080">(sighs)</font>
i'll get you some water.
<font color="#808080">(arrows clatter)</font>
thank you.
who's annie?
annie cresta. the girl
mags volunteered for.
she won, like, four years...
five years ago.
is she the one that
went a little...
mmm-hmm.
love is weird.
<font color="#804040">beetee:</font> i have a plan.
<font color="#804040">johanna:</font> finnick!
i have a plan.
where do the careers
feel safest? the jungle?
the jungle's a nightmare.
probably here on the beach.
then why are they not here?
because we are. we claimed it.
and if we left, they would come.
or stay hidden in the tree line.
which in just over four hours
will be soaked with water
from the 10:00 wave.
and what happens at midnight?
lightning strikes that tree.
here's what i propose.
we leave the beach at dusk. we
head to the lightning tree.
that should draw them
back to the beach.
prior to midnight we then run this
wire from the tree to the water.
anyone in the water
or on the damp sand
will be electrocuted.
how do we know the wire's
not gonna burn up?
because i invented it.
i assure you, it won't burn up.
well, it's better than
hunting them down.
yeah, why not?
if it fails, no harm
done anyway, right?
all right, i say we try it.
so what can we do to help?
keep me alive for
the next six hours.
that would be extremely helpful.
<font color="#808080">(inaudible)</font>
i think we need to go.
this plan's gonna work.
i think so, too.
and once the careers are dead,
we both know what happens next.
i don't want to be the
one that shoots first.
what if they don't either?
what if all of us
refuse to shoot first?
we might still end up dead.
maybe not. i mean, it
worked for us last time.
they're not gonna make
that same mistake again.
you know and i know that there's
only one person walking out of here.
and it's gonna be one of us.
the careers are still out there.
we should stick with these
guys till midnight.
and if we hear a cannon, we go.

katniss, i don't...
i don't know what kinda deals
you made with haymitch
but he made me promises, too.
if you die
and i live,
i'd have nothing.
nobody else that i care about.
peeta.
it's different for you.
your family needs you.
you have to live.
for them.
what about you?
nobody needs me.
i do.
i need you.
<font color="#804040">johanna:</font> all right, lovebirds!
<font color="#804040">snow:</font> she is preparing to fight.
that's our girl.
this is what you predicted.
moves and countermoves.
indeed.
we'll toast when it's done?
in the meantime, make
yourself comfortable.

minimal charring.
it's an impressive conductor.
let's get started.
typically a lightning strike
contains five billion
joules of energy.
we don't want to be anywhere in
the vicinity when this hits.
you two girls, go together now.
take this. unspool it carefully.
make sure the entire coil is
in the water. you understand?
then head to the tree
at the 2:00 sector.
we'll meet you there.
i'm gonna go with
them as a guard.
no, no, no. you're staying
here to protect me.
and the tree.
no, i need to go with her.
<font color="#804040">beetee:</font> there are two careers
out there. i need two guards.
finnick can protect you
just fine on his own.
why can't finnick and
johanna stay with you
and peeta and i'll
take the coil?
you all agreed to keep me
alive till midnight, correct?
it's his plan. we
all agreed to it.
is there a problem here?
excellent question.
no. there's no problem.
i'll see you at midnight.
<font color="#804040">johanna:</font> all right, let's go!
come on.
i want to put as much distance between
me and this beach as possible.
frying is not how i want to go.

<font color="#808080">(whispers)</font> johanna?

- peeta!
peeta!
katniss, where are you?

there's no guarantee.
<font color="#804040">finnick:</font> just tell
her her win...
morning, sweetheart.
<font color="#808080">(grunts)</font>
what are you doing with them?
<font color="#808080">(breathing heavily)</font>
you and a syringe
against the capitol?
see, this is why no one
lets you make the plans.
what the hell are
you doing in here?
stop. stop. just listen.
we couldn't tell you with snow
watching. it was too risky.
better for you to know nothing.
<font color="#808080">(grunts)</font>
where's peeta?
now, katniss...
you have been our mission
from the beginning.
the plan was always
to get you out.
half the tributes were in on it.
this is the revolution.
and you are the mockingjay.
and we're on our way to
district 13 right now.
<font color="#804040">katniss:</font> 13?
<font color="#804040">plutarch:</font> 13. yes.
where's peeta?
he still has his
tracker in his arm.
johanna cut yours out.
where is he?
in the capitol.
they got him and johanna.
you son of a bitch!
you son of a...
you promised me that you
would save him over me!
you promised me! you're a liar.
you're a liar.
<font color="#808080">(sobbing)</font>
hey, catnip.
you're okay.
you've just been
asleep for a few days.
are we home?
gale?
where's prim?
she's alive.
so is your mother. i
got 'em out in time.
got them out?
after the games,
they sent in hovercrafts.
and they started
dropping firebombs.
they're not in 12?
there is no district 12.
it's all gone.
