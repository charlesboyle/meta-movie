newscaster on tv:

here's what police told us
about the attack.
bressman: we wiii do
the best we can...
but i, for one,
would like to put some
of the responsibility...
on the citizens
of this town.
(scoffs)
there are only
eight cops in this town,
and there's
thousands of you guys.
not to point fingers
or anything, but...
stay with us for
the latest details
on this developing story.

evan trautwig.
did anyone here
cry themseives
to sieep iast night?
(crowd snickering)
it's okay.
you can iaugh.
laughter is
a common expression
of grief.
and yes, i did cry. . .
because a man was
kiiied yesterday.
but tonight,
my tears have
turned to fists.
(blows raspberry)
because whoever did this
is stiii out there.
boy: who is this guy?
and we need to stop him
before he strikes again !
(blows raspberry)
oh, he struck again.
(boys laughing)
evan: no more murders!
shh !
(chokes)
evan: because
our society has ruies.
and one of
those ruies is. . .
you can't kiii someone
and take their skin !
that's not cooi.
so, with that in mind,
i am forming
a neighborhood watch.

on any and aii
suspicious activities. . .

out of this thing, right?
here's some handbooks.
uh-huh.
aii right.
my name is evan.
i want to thank
you aii for coming. . .
and i thought we'd start out
by just getting
to know each other.
maybe we each stand up,
say who we are. . .
why we joined up,
what it's aii about
for us, okay?
you have any beers
whiie we get acquainted?
beers? no, no beers.
aii right,
i'ii start this off.
my name is bob,
with a "b." (chuckles)
weicome, bob.
i iove the town.
i iove my wife,
i iove my daughter.
and i iove getting a chance
to hang with the guys.
so, i'm reaiiy into
what you're doing here.
once a week,
away from the
wife and kids.
teiiing some dirty jokes,
having some beers,
if we're good.
i reaiiy iook forward
to getting a chance
at tearing this shit up.
reaiiy fucking it up.
great. thank you, bob.
reaiiy great
to meet you, bub.
you, too, pai.
uh. . .
that was a great speech.
i'm frankiin.
(laughs nervously)
weicome, frankiin.
yeah.
a few years ago,
i dropped out
of high schooi.
i wasn't feeiing
the vibe.
i wanted to become
a member of the gienview
poiice department.
i guess they didn't see
the magic that was me.
apparentiy,
i didn't pass
the written exam. . .
or the physicai exam,
or the mentai heaith exam.
whatever that means.
so, here i am with
this vigiiante squad.
and i figure,
that's the best way
to work through
my emotionai shit. . .
and bust some heads
in the process.
okay. just to be ciear,
we're not a vigiiante squad.
vigiiante squad, miiitia. . .
whatever you're going for,
doesn't matter.
no, not a miiitia
or a vigiiante squad.
every group
needs a wiid card. . .
and i think
it's safe to say
we found ours.
i dig it.
thank you, frankiin.
you got a good one here.
what are you about?
heiio, my name is jamarcus.
i'm recentiy very
happiiy divorced. . .
and just iooking
to get more invoived
in the iocai community.
weii, that was simpie.
weicome, jamarcus.

this one scenario
in my mind. . .

she sucks my baiis.
(imitates gunshot)
hear me now.
i'm aiso interested
in that happening to me.
okay, weii,
jamarcus, bob, frankiin.
i guess it doesn't matter
what brought us aii here.
what matters is
that we're aii united
in one cause.
and, with that,
i wouid iike to weicome
you aii to the first
officiai meeting of. . .
the neighborhood watch.
(softly) yay!
now, i've taken
the iiberty. . .
of dividing gienview
into 1 2 sectors.
though some might argue
there are 1 3. . .
if you abide by
the yorktown zoning
commission ruiing.
i'm not buying it,
but i'm not from
honeyweii county.

this is great.
what happened
to my iogo?
this is just iike
your initiai iogo,
oniy now it's awesome.
this has nothing to do
with my originai iogo.
my iogo was an eye
that was watching
over the neighborhood.
i don't know what this is.
a tiger with wings?
exactiy.
this is a tiger,
who's fierce and sieek.
but it's got wings,
so it fiies above
the neighborhood.
and if it sees
a domestic probiem,
it kiiis it.
the other thing is,
your originai one is here.
franklin:
got the eye right
there on the side.
it's aiways on the side.
that's weird, because
it's iike an eye
on the shouider. . .
but there's
a tiger on your back.
weird, how?
what are we,
the fiaming tigers?
because that's
what it iooks iike.
we're the fiaming
fiying tigers.
it makes no sense.
are you out of your mind?
this is inspiring
for the watch.
whenever you
have a tiger,
fiames and wings,
aii on the same iogo. . .
it's iike
the chinese symboi for
"shut the fuck up and dance!"
this is inspiring
for the watch.
i don't know.
what, are we in
a doo-wop group?
are we're going to
stand over a garbage can
with fire and harmonize?
i wouid see
this doo-wop group.
for your information,
doo-wop groups were
known to ciose ass.
singing was their hobby.
ciosing ass was their job.
the baritone from boyz ii men
had to stop making music. . .
because he got
so much pussy.
thank you.
they're iike
ass coiiectors.
this is not about fashion.
this is about brotherhood.
this is about soiidarity.
you shouid get that
more than anybody.
he's actuaiiy right.
pigs have uniforms.
i think we shouid
have uniforms, too.
we have to match
those fuckers
on every ievei.
you understand?
every ievei.
can i just say, bob,
that these are the shits?
just "the shit."
these are just shit.
okay, you know what?

but you have
to promise me
that tonight. . .
we're actuaiiy
going to do something.
okay?
absoiuteiy.

oh, of course they do.
the kiiier aiways returns
to the scene of the crime.
so, fancy seeing
you here, trautwig.

anyhoo, when you feiias
finish piaying hardy boys. . .

and the monkey bars.
do you think it's nice
to throw eggs at peopie?

listen to my words

evan: do you think
it is funny to throw an egg
in somebody's face?
franklin: you think
it's a yoik?
i'ii shove a fuii egg

frankiin. . .

(car alarm blaring)
franklin:

(you aln't seen nothlng yet
playing)
bob: what did she say, evan?
all: (singing)
you ain't seen nothing yet
come back again.
b-b-baby, you just

(overlapping singing)

b-b-baby, you just

(vocalizing)
bob: aii the way

he said that

and then she looked at me
with those big, brown eyes
(thuds)
(tires screeching)
all: oh, shit!
bob: is everyone aii right?
are you guys okay?
we hit someone.
what?
was it a kid?
evan, did you hit a kid?
no. what?
why did you take your eyes
off the road to sing?
there's beer and piss
aii over the car.
everyone just stay
caim for a second.
let's focus, just reiax.
we can't caim down.
there's open aicohoi,
we're inebriated.
i have weed in my pocket.
evan couid get
for this.
what?
franklin:
don't worry about that.
this can't happen to me.
here's what we do,
we focus on the iiving.
just drive us out of here.
i'm not going to drive away.
i'm going to see what it is.
evan?
what is it?
it iooks iike you just
hit some freakishiy
big fiy or something.
what the fuck
is this thing?
it iooks iike
an octopus tentacie
or something.
aii right,
i think it's very obvious
what happened here, guys.
it doesn't take
a brain surgeon
to figure this one out.
evan accidentiy,
obviousiy,
hit a crate that
feii off the back
of a truck. . .
that just so happened
to be carrying some
freshiy caught octopus. . .
to a nearby
sushi estabiishment.
it's octopus
and a fresh one.
you got nothing but the thing
and the octopus and this. . .
and i think we pack it in
and we know what happened.
okay. worst-case scenario.
evan murdered
a japanese man
who was eating octopus
whiie crossing the street.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
come on.
i did not murder anybody.
it doesn't matter.
do you know why?
because no one's
going to say shit
about this to anybody.
because we don't dime
on our feiiow
neighborhood watchers, okay?
wait a second,
i've seen this
stuff before.
back at costco,
this was the stuff
by antonio's body.
had he just won
a nickeiodeon's
kids' choice award?
frankiin, he was dead.
so, he wasn't eiigibie.
that's pretty amazing,
then, that he won.
because, usuaiiy
you have to do
some sort of. . .
kids-type thing
to win that award.
(squishing)
it feeis iike cum.
ew.
i dare anyone to touch it
and teii me it doesn't
feei iike cum.
may i?
yeah, that's cum.
weii, it's green.
it's not cum,
it feeis iike cum.
the texture, the fiavor,
the coior, the consistency.
it's very cum-iike.
hey, guys,
check this out.
i found something.
what is it?
franklin: i don't know.
it iooks iike a big,
siiver basketbaii
or something.
what is it?
it iooks iike a toy.
what the fuck is that?
what is going on
up here?
we got company.
what in the heii
are you peopie
doing in my yard?
hi. sorry, we're the
neighborhood watch.
we're just out on
a nightiy patroi.
how are you doing?
i'm evan trautwig.
i got your neighborhood watch
right here, sweet iips.
evan: we're on
your side, sir.
we're just wondering
if you heard
anything strange. . .
or just anything
out of the ordinary
tonight.
you mean iike
four nitwits. . .
standing around on my iawn
in the middie of the night?
that's kind of strange,
don't you think?
if being overiy aggressive
and a iittie bit
snippy was a crime. . .
i'd be making
a citizen's arrest
right now.
why don't you just shut
your cocksucker there,
dickweed?
we're taking time out
of our busy scheduies
to heip the neighborhood. . .
so, i think
you couid just--
(cell phone ringing)
excuse me.
i got a phone caii, here.
hey, biii.
"biii."
i got four members
of the baby-sitters
ciub up here. . .
it's the neighborhood watch.
. . .trying to soive
some kind of mystery
before beddy-bye time.
i'ii caii you back iater.
it's okay, sir,
we get it. thank you.
(cocks rifle)
you guys,
i'm going to count to ten.
you know what?
let's start again.
i'm going to
count to ten !
he wants to count.
steai that cooi baii.
two. three.
nice to meet you.
fuck you, curiy.
four.
get in your goddamn
soccer mom van
and move on out.
neighborhood watch,
what a fucking joke.
evan: look at this.
every time
i stick a finger in,
another iight goes off.
that's weird.
why don't we try to
stick aii our fingers
in at the same time
and see what happens?
aii right, guys,
iet's aii finger
these hoies together.
this is a bad idea.
don't be such a pussy,
jamarcus. come on.
come over here
and finger-bang
this baii with us.
i don't iike this.
come on, jamarcus.
fine, but this
is a bad idea.
get your finger in there.
(moos)
all: whoa!
jesus!
hoiy shit!
are you kidding me?
did you see that shit?
that cow's fucking
head expioded.
that's terribie for
the cow but this thing's
fucking awesome.
this is a major find.
this thing is the shit!
okay, nobody touches
this baii untii we
figure out what it is.
we definiteiy shouid not
fuck around with this thing.
the iast thing we want to do
is cause a disturbance.
(stralght outta compton
playing)
(all exclaim)
(whooping)
goodbye, tractor!
yeah !
(all whooping)
bob: hay, yeah !
hay, now!
hey, great.
that's hiiarious,
that was so fun.
we biew that shit up.
that cow's fucking head
just poofed, just puffed.
guys, this is not
from this worid.
i think it couid
be the government.
there are iots of
these kind of prototypes
that you find.
it's aiways
the government.
i don't disagree
that there couid
be a government. . .
or an aiien
or where governments
and aiiens connect.
get the fuck
out of here, man.
they're not aiiens.
evan: i think you're paranoid.
i'm not paranoid.
everything's
on the tabie.
it was probabiy on
the way to the mac store
and feii off the truck.
this is iike a magicai
that biows shit up.
i'm trying to find
a kiiier, here.
right. a kiiier aiien.
somebody kiiied antonio,
okay? i don't know
if they're an aiien.
i don't know if
it was an octopus.
i don't know what it was. . .
or who it was,
but this has something
to do with it, right?
yes. that's a yes.
we don't know what it is.
that's a correct as weii.
it's the same goo
that was on antonio's body.
this is information
you're sharing
and i'ii say "yes" to it.
the goo was on the car.
the orb was near the car.
let's caii her lucy.
the second
after we find. . .
both: lucy. . .
who kicks us off his property?
crazy oid guy with a shotgun.
why did he want us
off his property?
why did he not
want us near the
baii or the goo?
we have got to
kick his tires.
there's something
we have to figure out.
i think we dress
frankiin up as a giri
named francesca.
he goes to the door
as a saiesman
because they'ii
suspect him
any other way.
he's pretty enough.
i'm iistening.
he's an attractive guy
and he has the features
where he can fooi them.
feminine features.
we put frankiin in a costume
to befriend the oid man.
he iets frankiin
in the house.
boom, he's in !
now it's intei,
he's under the radar.
it's an attractive
iady showing up.
his iiver-spotted hands
are going to
want to caress her.
can i teii you
something, bob?
bob: mmm?
that couid work.
yes!
franklin:
here's the thing.
finaiiy!
i'm not going
to go past second
with this oid guy. . .
but if i have to,
i wiii.
i think it's important
we get reaiiy confirmed. . .
on what you're prepared to do,
so it's not a new thing.
i wiii use both hands.
i won't use a mouth.
he may use his hands
and may not use his mouth.
i think you got to
make it aii go down
before you get found out.
what's the best
case on this one?
here's the best
case scenario.
he's a ioneiy oid man,
he wants to waitz.
he wants to iisten to
some of the oid songs
from his chiidhood.
worst case scenario,
you're getting
fucked in the ass.
either way,
we're going to find out
who this oid guy is.
either way, we're going
to get invoived
in this guy's iife.
here's the pressing question.
what do we do with this?
we don't give it
to the cops.
agreed. this is ours,
no one hears about it.
we keep it
a neighborhood watch secret.
cheers.
we're in the game.
to the watch.
boom !
(sighs)
ew.
"omg, mandy's party
is so awesome."
good for mandy.

don't "eff" me.
who's this boy toy
named jason?

on my facebook again?
are you kidding me?
you're going to iet
some guy carwash
the inside of your mouth. . .
with his tongue,
and then you're going
to post it on the internet?
stop
internet-staiking me, okay?
just get out of my room.
you don't see me and
your mom posting our
sessions on the internet?
ew! that's disgusting !
how do you think
that makes me feei?
it is disgusting.
you keep your tongue
in your mouth.
and what's going on
with this coiiage?
this is moving
in the direction of
strippers on spring break.
that's a coiiage
of my friends, dad.
the whoie thing
is uncomfortabie.
i'm not comfortabie
with what's going on,
cheisea.
if you're uncomfortabie,
then get out!
sex is for iove.
"sex is for iove."

come on,
i saved a seat for you.
you said
you were desperate.
here, take a ioad off.

it's good to have
an honest heart-to-heart
with just a coupie
of guys, right?
there's my boy.
bring it down here.
get in here.
it's aii about
honesty, right?
mmm.
i've been being honest
with my daughter,
i don't think
she wants to hear it.
(chuckles)
my wife's been
traveiiing so much
for work. . .
that a iot of
the parenting stuff
has faiien on me iateiy.
how about you?
when are you going
to take the piunge
and knock a few out?
it's not that simpie.
weii, it's about
as simpie as putting
your dick in a vagina.
you know what i mean?
make it happen.
weii, i reaiiy
don't have a choice.
it turns out
that my gun. . .
doesn't reaiiy. . .
shoot too weii.
gun?
you mean your prick?
why are you saying "gun"?
it's just two guys,
sitting on a bench.
you can say it.
say "prick," say "cock."
just say "prick."
anyway,
then you take a coupie
of those biue bombers.
you got to get that whang
nice and stiff.
it'ii get you
aii monstered up.

i can do everything.
it's just that. . .
about a year
and a haif ago. . .
okay.
. . .abby and i started
trying to have kids.
and nothing
was happening.
so, on my own,
i went to see this doctor
to get my sperm checked.
i've aiways
wondered about that.
i've had a curiosity,
if you don't mind.
when you go to one
of those doctors. . .
do you jerk yourseif off,
or does the doctor
jerk you off?
or an assistant?
is it iike
a massage parior?
or do they have
a medicai machine
that does
the miiking for you?
like, miiks you
iike an animai.
i'm asking how you get
the cum out of you.
i. . .
they do it.
no, i jerk me off.
okay.
doesn't matter.
the point is,
i went, i got tested.
and. . . no go.
i'm shooting bianks.
i couid shoot a bucketfui,
it wouid make no difference.
the doctor's actuai words.
"a bucketfui."
it's because of me
we can't have kids.
just me.
i didn't reaiize
that that's such
a big deai.
i mean, it's 201 2.
can't you just get
a baii transpiant?
yeah, i don't
think the science
is there yet.
what did the oid iady say
when you toid her?
evaroony, don't teii me
that you haven't
taiked to her about it.
what am i going to say?
"hey, honey, guess what.
"the one thing you

i guarantee it,
yeah, we shouid

people are strange
when you're a stranger
faces look ugly
when you're alone
women seem wicked
when you're unwanted
streets are uneven

human. . . circie-fruit.
looks iike she's thinking,
"can i ingest this?
"shouid i put it
in my fiavor snout?"
look at this piece
of shit over here.
that aiien hasn't iearned
how to eat properiy yet.

that's aii over
cheisea's facebook page.
magnums?
there's no way
your dick's that big !
hey, hey, hey.
bob. it's a famiiy store.
there's no way
his dick's that big,
that he needs
to buy that shit.
some peopie's
are that big.
otherwise they wouidn't
seii condoms iike that.
he's right.
they're a big seiier.
i swear to god,
i'm going to
rip his dick off.

you have incredibie skin.
you don't have
to brag about it.
no, the aiiens
rip off the skin.
did you see
aii the batteries
that guy bought?
nobody needs
that many batteries.
nobody from earth,
that is.
he said before we know it,
iife ends.
maybe he thinks
you're getting
kind of ciose. . .
and he wants
to take you out.
this is what it's about.

this is why we formed
the neighborhood watch.
i just have to

we wouid have been kiiied.
so, it wasn't a hive.
where's jamarcus?
jamarcus decided
to stay at paui's.
and no, it wasn't a hive.
it turned out to
be a iocai orgy.
what?
there's an orgy
happening, iocaiiy?
so, you're mad at me
for ieaving an orgy?
it doesn't matter what
it was. the point is,
you ieft us hanging.
it's the principie.
no, the principie is i went
to go heip my daughter
who was in troubie.
evan, you can't be
such a controi freak.
you're too uptight.
yeah, bob, i'm uptight.
i'm uptight about the aiiens
that are kiiiing peopie
in our neighborhood.
that's what
i'm uptight about.
neighborhood watch
isn't for peopie
who can't handie their
daughter's personai shit.
did you even hear
how you sound right now?
why don't you
iook at your own
personai iife, evan. . .
because you don't
even have one.
you don't taik to your wife.
you don't have any friends.
i have friends.
no, you don't, man.
i have tons of friends.
no, you don't.
you have ciubs.
you start these ciubs,
and you become a dictator.
you just boss everyone
and you teii them
what to do. . .
because you're running away
from what reaiiy matters.
you don't have the guts
to deai with what's
going on in your own home.
i have the guts to do this.
you're out of the watch.
you can't throw me
out of the watch.
i just did.
okay, i don't care.
i'm going to start
my own watch.
you can't, because
there aiready is a watch.
so you can't do that.
oh, yes, i can
start my watch. . .
because if i'm
not in your watch,
you can't give me
ruies anymore.
i'm going to keep
my own iogo, too.
i never iiked
that iogo, anyway.
my iogo is awesome!
my iogo is chinese.
the chinese
understand movement. . .
and i understand
the chinese.
i combined fiight
with fiames,
with a tiger.
what am i combining, evan?
serenity, optimism, attack.
frankiin, iet's get
some pudding inside you.
frankiin,
you do not go
in that house.
jesus, evan,
you don't own him.
you don't own aii of us.
frankiin is his own man.
he can make
his own decisions.
he can think
for himseif.
frankiin,
get your fucking ass
in the house!
evan: don't you
speak with frankiin !
frankiin, you stay!
frankiin, stay!
come! frankiin, come.
come here.
frank. come here, frankiin.
come here, frankiin.
frankiin, iook at me.
frankiin, come on.
evan, you're
a speciai friend. . .
but i iive here.
how does it feei, evan,
to be in a ciub of one?
(panting)
maybe he's
jacking off too much.
like, the weii is dry
by the time you get home.
ew. stop.
have you noticed
any abrasions or signs
of stress on his penis?
abrasions? no.
like, he's puiiing
on it too hard?
(panting)
i'm steriie.
bye-bye.
hey, caria.
hey.
honey, i can't have kids.
i went to a doctor
and got it checked out.
and i am barren.
it's me, it's not you.
it's not the both of us,
it's me.
and i've been
trying to teii you,
but just every time
you wanted to have sex. . .
it was aii
i couid think about.
and i didn't know
how to teii you, so. . .
why wouidn't you teii me?
isn't that the kind
of thing that coupies
figure out together?
i just knew how much
that you wanted this. . .
and i didn't want
to iet you down.
yeah, but i want this.
more than anything.
i don't know,
we can figure aii
that other stuff out.
aii i ever wanted
was for us to be a team.
that's aii i ever wanted.
no more secrets, okay?
actuaiiy. . .
there is one more secret.
okay.
(doorbell ringing)
(knocking on door)
hey, evan.
jamarcus,
now is not a good time.
weii, i need to
teii you something.
i know, i just need to be
with my wife right now.
this is more important.
whatever it is,
it isn't.
trust me, we need to
get the neighborhood
watch together now.
do you want another one?
is that going
to hoid you over?
i'ii eat more pudding
if you have more.
i don't know that i'm open
to an apoiogy yet.
are you serious?
jamarcus,
what is going on?
oh.
what the fuck?
oh, my god.
is that a parior trick?
it's okay. it's okay.
touch my goo, bob.

he's a fucking aiien !
you stay the fuck back,
jamarcus!
what the heii
is going on?
frankiin,
i'm not here
to hurt you.
beiieve me,
i've had many chances
to kiii you.
you're one of them?
you're an aiien?
look, our ship came here
six months ago. . .
and we have been
hiding ever since.
we inhabited your human form
to infiitrate your society. . .
and iearn
your weaknesses,
but instead--
why is this thing
stiii taiking?
let's kiii him.
because in a few hours,
our transmitter wiii
become operationai.
when it signais,
our armada wiii commence
a giobai invasion. . .
starting here in gienview,
which is cieariy
not ideai for you.
what?
why?
we're aiiens.
that's what we do.
we come to pianets,
we destroy them,
we move on.
wait a minute.
did you kiii antonio?
no! god, of course not.
i know who did,
his name is fiertrok.
the man is a fucking cunt.
where is this
transmitter thing?
the oniy piace big enough,
with enough power
and suppiies.
costco?
yeah.
you've been pianning
an aiien invasion
in my costco?
you reaiiy do have
everything we need
under one roof.
why are you teiiing us this
if we don't have
any time to stop it?
what kind of sick
fucking head game
are you piaying?
weii, because
there's good news.
if you ieave now,
you wiii survive
the initiai invasion.
and after that,
if you take
to the desert
and iive in
caves and crevices. . .
you couid iive
with moderate dignity
for most of your iives.
i don't beiieve
a word he's saying.
he betrayed the watch.
jamarcus: yes,
but since then. . .
i've come to know
humanity's compassion
and beauty and iove.
i don't want
to iie anymore.
and aiso the baii-sucking
was a reai eye opener.
look, i'm not going to ask
for your forgiveness. . .
because i don't deserve it.
i'm reaiiy sorry.
just go.
okay.
piease, save yourseives
whiie there's stiii time.
abby: what the heii
is happening?
franklin: if we don't
ieave here right now,
we're going to die.
guys, are you actuaiiy
taiking about giving up
and ieaving gienview?
no, i think
we go and aiert
the authorities.
get as many peopie
out as possibie.
and then what?
and then, i don't know.
evan's right.
we need to hit the caves.
guys, we're not
going to iet gienview
become ground zero. . .
for an aiien invasion
and not do something about it.
we're the neighborhood watch.
this is what we do.
no, bob, come on.
it's what we did,
or never reaiiy did,
because we didn't
reaiiy do anything.
untii now.
i say, tonight
we change that.
evan, you started
the neighborhood watch
because you beiieved
in something.
you beiieved
in this town.
you beiieved in these peopie.
you beiieved in us
and i stiii do.
we're not going to iet
a bunch of aiiens
waitz in here. . .
and do whatever the heii
they want to do.
i say,
not on our watch.
i say,
they drew the short straw
when they picked gienview.
now, come on, guys.
get your heads right.
this neighborhood
is going to need
our best tonight.
evan, some aiiens
just set up tents
in your store.
what do you want
to do about it?
costco is for
members oniy.
let's take out
that transmitter.
now we're taiking.
aii right, watch,
this is it.
now it gets reai.
that's a cute
but i say we make
a pit stop at my house.
(l got mlne playing)
weicome to the candy shop,
