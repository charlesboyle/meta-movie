woman 1 [over pa]: once again,
for passengers traveling on flight 1457...
[man coughing]
...to orlando, please take advantage
of the boarding bag-check announcement.
[woman 1 speaks indistinctly
over pa]
[cell phone rings]
you'll pick it up at baggage claim
in orlando.
it's a really full flight today.
- hey.
jon [over phone]: yeah, jon neal here.
you just had sex with me in a hotel
and left without saying goodbye.
yeah, it ended up being delayed, so...
sorry, i was panicking.
well, if i don't get to see you again...
...i just wanted to say
it was nice to see you again.
yeah, it was nice to see you too.
heh.
um, and listen,
use that other e-mail i gave you...
...because that's the only secure one,
okay?
okay.
[coughs]
you all right?
yeah, i'm just...
i'm just jet-lagged. i'm tired.
you should go home and get some rest.
hong kong's a long way.
woman 2 [over pa]:
attention passengers on flight 5228...
- oh, wait.
...to minneapolis.
jon:
is that you?
yep, that's me. they're calling my flight.
all right.
well, look, i'm really glad you called.
- thanks. bye.
- bye.
woman 2: please have your
boarding passes out and ready.
thanks.
[inaudible dialogue]
[coughs]
[chickens clucking]
[horn honks]
- good morning, roger.
roger: hey.
so you really kicked ass
in that football pool, huh?
you need to give up on your lions.
pick with your head, not your heart.
yeah, thank you for the tip.
- yeah. hey, hey. hey, doc, uh...
- yeah?
i know you're busy. uh... i, uh...
- you got a second?
- sure.
- i got a medical question.
- mm-hm.
uh, my kid's been, uh,
having problems at school.
- uh, attention deficit thing.
- adhd?
- yeah.
- he been diagnosed yet?
that's the thing.
they want him to see someone.
i was wondering
if you could take a look at him.
- i'm not really that kind of doctor.
- oh. ha, ha. i didn't know. i just thought...
maybe i can refer someone, though.
- yeah?
- yeah. it's treatable.
- okay.
- we'll find someone, have them take a look.
- shouldn't be a problem.
- okay.
- all right.
- yup.
- thanks, doc.
- you're welcome.
[chattering and coughing
on monitor]
lorraine: why doesn't anybody
help him? is he okay?
alan:
read the posts.
some say it was staged. an art project.
some say the authorities
wouldn't do an autopsy.
covered it up.
- covered what up?
- we don't know.
maybe minamata disease.
you know, from mercury in the fish.
there have been outbreaks in the past.
fishing industry suppresses it.
- "industrial disease."
- yeah, but it's just one man.
- we don't know what happened.
- just one man on video.
not everyone has the foresight
to die in front of a camera.
the ones we don't see worry me.
fish is shipped all over the world
from there.
how many people read your paper
over a plate of sushi?
alan, we have almost no freelance budget
anymore, and after h1...
you wait. a few days, this will be tweeted
and youtubed all over the planet.
we don't wanna be the paper
that cries wolf.
i'll show it to hobart.
he does our health stuff.
you're gonna give him my story?
you're gonna give him my story, aren't you?
no, alan, i'm trying to help you.
it's just one man on a bus.
- i taped this meeting.
- we need more information than that.
this story runs in the chronicle,
i will sue your ass.
great. okay, bye, alan.
don't call me anymore.
print media is dying, lorraine.
it's dying. i'll save you a seat on the bus.
hi, i'm mitch emhoff.
i'm clark's stepdad. clark morrow.
secretary:
all right, i'll let him know you're here.
okay.
he said he was feeling very warm
in mrs. tatum's class.
[coughing]
i took his temperature again since i called.
it was a touch over a hundred.
mitch: okay. well, first his mom
and now the mighty clark, huh?
all right, let's go get some soup
for you and mom.
school nurse:
hope you feel better, clark, okay?
okay. thank you.
mitch:
thattaboy.
we're gonna beat this thing down
by turkey day.
woman [on tv]:
i'm in texas. i'll try it. i'll try anything once.
man:
ha, ha. that's not true.
mitch: jory's going straight from
the band trip to her mom's place.
and my job interview got pushed
to next week.
i'm not really sure what that means.
hopefully nothing.
[glass shatters]
[sighing]
hey.
my arm.
come here, sit down, sit down, sit down.
watch your feet. come on.
come on. come on, honey.
okay, what happened?
did you take too much of that flu shit?
honey? beth, beth.
hey, hey, hey. honey, honey.
beth. jesus. jesus.
sweetheart. sweetheart. hey, beth.
clark: mom?
- no, no, no. uh... stay there, clark. don't...
just go... go up to your room, honey.
uh...
honey, honey.
mitch: beth.
doctor: beth, can you hear me?
my name's dr. arrington.
you're in the hospital.
you had a seizure this morning, beth.
nurse: she have a history of seizures?
- no, no, no.
nurse: allergies?
- uh, i think she's allergic to penicillin.
doctor: she fall recently? hit her head?
- no, she came back from a trip...
doctor:
what about drugs? mdma? ecstasy?
no. no, we don't do that.
doctor: okay, let's get some help in here.
mitch: jesus. beth. beth.
nurse:
sir, you have to go. you have to go.
doctor:
let's get a line in her.
and give me 2 milligrams of ativan,
please.
[ekg beeping rapidly]
so, um, despite all our efforts,
she failed to respond.
- okay.
- and her heart stopped...
...and unfortunately, she did die.
right.
- i'm sorry, mr. emhoff.
- i know this is hard to accept.
okay. i mean, so can i go talk to her?
mr. emhoff, i'm sorry. your wife is dead.
i mean, i just saw her.
we were just at home.
is there somebody that we can call?
someone who you think should be here
with you?
i mean, we had dinner. we had pizza.
she said she was jet-lagged.
you mentioned that she was away.
hong kong?
we checked the latest bulletins.
the only things there were measles
and h1 n1...
...and this was not that.
then what was it?
we don't always know.
i mean, some people get a disease and live,
some get sicker and die.
we're gonna have to notify
the medical examiner...
...and they may request an autopsy.
or if you wish, we can order one.
but i can't guarantee
it's gonna tell you any more than i can.
i mean, my best guess is that this
was either meningitis or encephalitis...
...and with encephalitis,
we're in the dark a lot of the time.
if it was summer, i might say a bug bite,
you know, west nile.
- i don't know...
- herpes can cause encephalitis.
she didn't have herpes.
- what are you talking about?
- okay.
what happened to her?
- what happened to her?
- okay, okay.
mr. emhoff, there are grief counselors...
...who are very helpful
with this sort of passing, okay?
you might find some resolution there.
now, i am sorry.
[cell phone ringing]
hello?
hang up the phone and call 911 right now.
right now. 911.
carrie anne: he said he had a headache,
so i put him to bed.
i don't think he's breathing.
clark. clark.
oh, my god, is he dead?
leopold: what we are hearing from
beijing is that the outbreak is contained...
...to the chrysanthemum complex
in hong kong.
two deaths and 10 suspected cases.
who official:
how are we defining "contained?"
leopold: they're using the same protocols
established for sars.
they're quarantining the complex
and screening for symptoms.
orantes: kowloon is the most densely
populated area in the world...
...and hong kong is a harbor.
it's going to spread.
leopold:
hong kong is sending us blood samples.
we're also looking at samples
from london.
two clusters: one at a hotel,
the other at a health club.
five dead, encephalitis.
and there's the man on the bus in tokyo.
- three dead in that cluster.
- any of them travel to china or london?
we're checking.
paramedic:
mr. neal, i want you to stay with me here.
can you hear me?
have you had seizures before? mr. neal?
- i want you to open your eyes if you can.
mrs. neal: he's breathing, right?
[sobbing] i couldn't wake him.
i got home, i couldn't wake him.
we both woke up sick this morning.
paramedic:
watch your head.
[saw buzzing]
medical examiner:
hmm...
well, the sulci are obliterated.
let's look at the base.
oh, my god.
you want me to take a sample, or?
i want you to move away from the table.
- should i call someone, or?
- call everyone.
cheever: well, these things happen
up there from time to time.
meningitis in a college dorm
after a swim meet...
...or west nile in some summer camp
near a lake.
i was reading that last summer they had
an outbreak of enterovirus encephalitis.
a hundred and three cases,
mainly children.
well, it's probably too cold up there
for that right now.
as of last night,
there were five deaths and 32 cases.
there's a cluster
in an elementary school.
that's the kind of thing
you have to be prepared for.
it's gonna be all over the news.
what's your single overriding
communications objective?
we're isolating the sick and quarantining
those who we believe were exposed.
okay, good.
as of this moment,
you and i are attached at the cell phone.
if you need resources, call me.
if you get into a political dogfight, call me.
if you find yourself wide awake,
staring at the walls at 3 a. m...
...wondering why you took the job,
call me.
dave: i sure hope you packed something
warmer than that.
we're looking at around zero
with the windchill.
don't want you to catch cold.
do you wanna go to the hotel first,
get situated?
mears:
i'd prefer to get started, if that's possible.
dave: okay.
mears: how far is the office?
about a half-hour from here.
doctor:
your dad's in isolation.
you can go up to the window,
pick up the phone, and you can talk to him.
mitch: hey.
- dad.
- hey.
- are you sick?
no, no, no. i'm... uh...
this is all just, you know, a precaution.
they're, you know, just making sure.
but you were with them.
you could still get it.
no, i won't. um,
they said this happens really, really fast.
and, uh, i'm fine.
there's nothing wrong with me.
there's nothing wrong with me.
we're okay. we're okay.
and clark?
yeah, you know, i, um...
i wasn't there.
i went, uh, in the ambulance with, uh, beth.
and, uh, i just didn't... i...
i left him with, uh, carrie anne.
i should have been there.
- i could have helped.
- no, no, no. honey, no, no.
it's good that you weren't there.
i'm happy.
if something had happened to you,
i mean, i'd...
honey, you're here now, you know.
i'm happy about that.
i'm happy about that.
when are you coming home?
soon. very soon. they, you know...
- why don't you go, uh, to your mom's?
- no.
- just stay in wisconsin.
- no. she doesn't need me.
she's got dan. i live here.
you don't have anybody.
i'm not leaving you.
official 1: we have 47 cases
and eight deaths as of 5 this afternoon.
it's a weekend.
these numbers might be low.
people are staying home for a couple days,
see if they get better.
at this point, i think
we have to believe this is respiratory.
- maybe fomites too.
- what's that, fomites?
uh, it refers to transmission
from surfaces.
the average person touches their face
- two- or 3000 times a day?
- three to five times every waking minute.
in between, we're touching doorknobs...
...water fountains,
elevator buttons and each other.
those things become fomites.
is this something we wanna release
to the press? respiratory and fomites?
- how's the public gonna react?
- hard to say. a plastic shark in a movie...
...will keep people from getting
in the ocean, but a warning on cigarettes...
we need to walk the governor through this
before we freak everybody out.
i mean, heh, we can't even tell people
right now what they should be afraid of.
we tried that with swine flu.
all we did was get healthy people scared.
it's the biggest shopping weekend
of the year.
official 2:
we need to consider closing schools.
and who stays home with the kids?
people that work at stores.
government workers.
people that work at hospitals.
when will we know what this is?
what causes it, what cures it?
things that keep people calm.
what we need to determine is this:
for every person who gets sick...
...how many other people
are they likely to infect?
so for seasonal flu,
that's usually about one.
smallpox, on the other hand,
it's over three.
now, before we had a vaccine...
...polio spread at a rate
between four and six.
now, we call that number...
...the r-nought.
r stands for the reproductive rate
of the virus.
any ideas what that might be for this?
how fast it multiplies depends
on a variety of factors.
the incubation period,
how long a person is contagious.
sometimes people can be contagious
without even having symptoms.
we need to know that too.
we need to know how big the population
of people susceptible to the virus might be.
so far that appears to be everyone
with hands, a mouth and a nose.
once we know the r-nought, we'll be able
to get a handle on the scale of the epidemic.
so it's an epidemic now.
an epidemic of what?
we sent samples to the cdc.
in 72 hours, we'll know what it is,
if we're lucky.
clearly, we're not lucky.
eisenberg:
what do we got?
a young woman in minnesota,
recently traveled to china.
son also died.
as of this morning, 87 cases, 15 deaths.
- did you have a good thanksgiving?
- i worked.
you? really?
texas. salmonella. pretty limited.
- mine was great, thanks.
- oh.
it's pleomorphic,
but tends toward ovoid in shape.
i see structures on the surface
that look like glycoproteins...
...but there's nothing
morphologically pathognomonic.
we tested all her antibodies.
i didn't see much cross-reactivity.
her body had no idea what to do with it.
it just kept amplifying.
hextall:
send it to sussman in san francisco.
if he doesn't know what it is,
nobody does.
it shows novel characteristics
and appears to be chimeric in origin.
virus is 15 to 19 kilobases in length
and containing six to 10 genes.
typical of a paramyxovirus.
it's godzilla, king kong
and frankenstein all in one.
sussman: hold on. shit, i'll call you back.
- you've got it in there.
- get away from here.
- where'd it come from? military?
you're not a doctor
and you're not a writer.
yes, i am a writer. yes, i am.
blogging is not writing.
it's graffiti with punctuation.
i am a journalist, and there's
informed discussion on the blogosphere...
...that this is a biological weapon.
you wanna talk to me,
call my office and make an appointment.
french: dr. cheever?
- yes.
- do you have a moment?
- sure.
we found him. tell the unit
on the way to his house to come in.
excuse me. who are you?
my name is dennis french
with the department of homeland security.
and what's this all about?
rear admiral haggerty's expecting us
in the emergency operations center.
we can discuss it there.
french:
this happened in kowloon.
today we've got workers at a casino
in macao striking over conditions.
three have died in one bunkhouse.
cia thinks there may be a connection.
casinos are of particular concern
to homeland security.
someone's ready to blow themselves up
at a pizzeria or the local market...
...the thought of getting themselves sick
with smallpox...
...and walking through a crowded casino
must have crossed their mind.
what did they die of, the three?
reports are vague. seizures, comas.
we've reached out to the who,
see what they know.
if you were gonna plan it,
can't think of a better time.
- plan what?
- an attack.
is there any way
someone could weaponize the bird flu?
someone doesn't have to weaponize
the bird flu.
the birds are doing that.
newscaster: officials are reporting
the closing of mondale elementary school...
...in suburban minneapolis...
...in response to the recent outbreak
of a still-unknown disease...
...that has so far taken the life
of a school nurse and three students.
other schools in district 281
will remain open...
...but parents have been notified
to keep home any children with symptoms.
the department of health
is awaiting confirmation...
...but sources say these new cases
may be connected to the sudden death...
...of a 34-year-old
aimm alderson executive...
...and her 6-year-old son
this holiday weekend.
hello. i'm dr. mears.
i'm an epidemic intelligence service
officer...
...and i'm here from atlanta to find out
what happened to beth emhoff.
okay, i'm gonna ask you some questions
and see if...
there was a package she messengered
from hong kong.
- i opened it with scissors. i'm not sure if...
- no. it shouldn't be an issue.
virus can't live for days on a box.
we did pilates together.
i called her after she got back.
i never heard from her.
- so you had no contact with her?
- no.
- did she go to the class?
- i didn't see her there.
we had coffee the day she left.
i think she might have moved my cup
because it was on some papers.
- i can't remember.
- how many days ago?
about 10 days.
that's okay.
the incubation period is less than that.
is there anyone else
who might have had contact with her?
- this was everyone.
man 1: aaron barnes did.
man 2:
barnes? he worked on another floor.
man 1: there were documents she needed.
he picked her up from the airport.
[cell phone ringing]
mears: he picked her up from the airport?
where is he?
hello?
- hello? mr. barnes?
barnes: hello? yes.
this is dr. mears
from the centers for disease control.
- i believe...
- hi.
hi. i believe you may have had contact
with beth emhoff last week.
yeah, i picked her up at the airport.
what's this about?
[barnes coughs]
- and how are you feeling today?
- uh, pretty cruddy, to be honest.
my head is pounding.
i probably picked up some bug.
- where are you right now?
- i'm on the bus, heading to work.
- i'd like you to get off immediately.
- what?
- he's on a bus.
dave: where?
- where? where's the bus, aaron?
- um... uh...
- lake and lyndale. what's going on?
- lake and lyndale.
i really need you to get off that bus.
it's possible you've come in contact
with an infectious disease...
...and you're highly contagious.
do you understand?
i want you to get off now.
and stay away from other people.
now what do i do?
don't talk to anyone, don't touch anyone.
that's the most important thing.
- we'll send somebody to meet the bus.
- okay.
i'm on my way to you now, aaron.
[coughing]
what about my kids? i touched them.
it was a groundbreaking ceremony
for a new factory.
she traveled a lot for work.
did her work involve contact with livestock
in any way?
- did you keep any pets at home?
- no.
no.
did she mention seeing anyone
who was sick?
anyone on a plane?
no.
she went through customs in chicago
at 11:15 a. m...
...and then took a flight to minneapolis
at 6 p.m.
any idea what she did in chicago
during that layover?
did she have meetings?
is there any reason
she might have left the airport?
why? i mean, is there
someone sick in chicago?
uh, before we were married,
my wife had a relationship...
...with a man in chicago named jon neal.
is jon neal sick?
did we get this from him?
- we're investigating all the possibilities.
- no. i think i have a right to know.
look at where i am here.
look at where i am here.
- i can't disclose that information. i'm sorry.
- no, i'm just... i'm just trying to understand.
i know.
hextall:
we're getting the same results as sussman.
we've sequenced the virus,
determined its origin...
...and we've modeled the way
it enters the cells of the lung and the brain.
the virus contains
both bat and pig sequences.
the dark green is pig,
and the light green is bat.
and here you can see
the crossover event.
uh, bat, bat, and pig, bat.
and here is a model of the virus
and how it attaches to its host.
the blue is virus, and the gold is human,
and the red is the viral attachment protein...
...and the green is its receptor
in the human cells.
these receptors are found in the cells
of both the respiratory tract...
...and the central nervous system.
and the virus attaches to the cell
like a key slipping into a lock.
somewhere in the world,
the wrong pig met up with the wrong bat.
- you ever seen anything like this before?
- no. and it's still changing.
it's figuring us out
faster than we're figuring it out.
it doesn't have anything else to do.
so we have a novel virus
with a mortality rate in the low 20s...
...no treatment protocol,
and no vaccine at this time.
that is correct.
[cheever sighs]
from here on out, i want no one working
on this except at bsl-4.
last thing we need is for this to walk out of
the lab on the bottom of someone's shoe.
[cell phone ringing]
dr. sussman's office.
hextall:
ian, hi. ally hextall.
we need to shut you down.
this thing's too hot. uh...
- bsl-4 only at this point.
- i think that's a mistake.
cook your samples.
uh, destroy everything.
- we can't risk it.
- we're making progress.
you limit this to government-run bsl-4s,
it'll take forever.
i can do this.
i'm sorry.
[sighs]
yeah.
sure, ally.
reporter 1 [on tv]:
can you repeat the affected cities so far?
cheever:
again, the affected cities are...
...minneapolis, chicago, los angeles,
boston and salt lake.
we expect that list to grow...
...as people return home
from their holidays.
yes?
reporter 2: dr. cheever,
how many people are infected...
...and how many have died?
cheever:
those numbers are changing as we speak...
...so any figure i give you
is likely to be low.
we're still calculating the mortality rate
at this time.
reporter 3:
uh, dr. cheever, are you concerned...
...that the cdc faces
a credibility issue here...
...after the perceived overreaction
to h1 n1?
i'd rather the story be
that we overreacted...
...than that many people lost their lives
because we didn't do enough.
that's why we're here.
it's also why the world health organization
is sending an epidemiologist to hong kong.
hard to know what it is
without where it came from.
our first job with these things
is to find ground zero.
figure out how it jumped
into the population.
we do know that a patient in minnesota...
...traveled to that part of the world.
[inaudible dialogue]
we believe that there are
approximately 89,000 cases at this point...
...and that we are heading
toward 267,000.
and from there, using our model,
based on an r-nought of two...
...here is where we expect to be
in 48 hours.
dr. cheever, perhaps you can update us
on the research.
as of right now, no one has found
a good way to grow the virus in cells.
orantes [over monitor]:
why is that?
because it kills every cell we put it in.
a pig, a chicken, everything.
until we can grow it, and a great deal of it,
we can't experiment with it.
and until then,
we can't vaccinate against it.
have you found any treatment at all?
any antivirus? anything?
no.
orantes: beth emhoff used an atm
at a casino in macao.
citibank released her records.
we have her using the machine at 10:43
just off the casino floor.
i wanna see the casino security footage
for two hours on either side of that.
[both speaking in chinese]
is there a problem?
oh, they're from my village.
they found a new cluster there.
oh.
- is your family still there?
- my mother has symptoms.
i'll get you the footage you require.
excuse me.
[chattering]
[woman coughing]
[phone rings]
dr. sussman, i heard that they were
shutting us down.
yeah, i just have to deal
with the samples.
if it's just a matter of destroying them,
i can do it.
no, i'll take care of it. you go on home.
i'll do that,
and then i just want to recheck some data.
cheever:
he grew it.
hextall: he tried antibodies
and immunological mac outlines...
...but the key was a fetal-bat cell line
from geelong.
- we didn't have it.
- he grew it in a bsl-3.
ally, what the hell was he doing
working with it in a bsl-3?
ignoring me.
[cheever sighs]
he's gonna publish.
shit. what does he want?
a box of cigars. he had a choice, ellis.
he could have gone into business
for himself.
there's no doubt he was approached,
but he gave it to us.
- and we're supposed to trust him?
- we don't have a choice.
newscaster: the centers for disease
control and prevention in the united states...
...and the world health organization
in switzerland...
...confirmed today that dr. ian sussman
of san francisco...
...has succeeded in growing
the mev-1 virus in a laboratory setting.
officials at the cdc cautioned that
the breakthrough is only the first step...
...toward developing a vaccine...
...which is likely still months away
from human trials.
the who estimates the number of people
infected worldwide to be over 8 million.
alan:
now it all changes.
sussman gets anointed
by the national academy of sciences...
...and every pharmaceutical executive
gets a hard-on.
they'll be growing the virus
in every lab on earth.
it's a bad day to be a rhesus monkey.
crikey, first we shoot them into space,
now we'll be shooting them full of virus.
so this is where we need your expertise.
pharmaceutical stocks
are already through the roof.
what's next? where's the opportunity?
now, you saw that shinko bus thing
day one.
that's why we wanted this meeting.
when i turned on my computer
this morning...
...i had over 2 million unique visitors,
all looking for the truth.
you think they wanna see me
talking to some hedge-fund guy?
mr. krumwiede,
we don't invent need here.
we just analyze it, predict it.
you tell me what it costs
to look into your crystal ball.
you're familiar with forsythia?
- no, i'm not.
- what i'm about to tell you is backed up...
...by testimonials that will appear shortly
in the media.
i'll be talking about it extensively
in the days ahead.
what does forsythia do?
it's the cure.
mitch: if i'm immune,
can't you use my blood to cure this?
mears: blood serums can take a long time
to make, and are very expensive.
but the good news here
is that you're not going to get sick.
okay. um...
then that would mean that
my daughter can't get it either, right?
i can't promise you that.
but isn't that something
that she would inherit from me?
well, half her immune system
came from you...
...but the other half
came from her mother.
[clamoring and coughing]
man:
- almost three hours.
i need to see a doctor
or a supervisor or something.
i wanna know if he has this thing
on the news.
nurse: i'm sorry, sir,
we're doing the best we can.
man: can i just speak to an administrator
or something? anybody.
nurse:
sir, please be patient. we'll get you in...
man:
he's sick!
dave: my wife makes me take off
my clothes in the garage.
then she leaves out a bucket of warm water
and some soap.
and then she douses everything
in hand sanitizer after i leave.
i mean, she's overreacting, right?
not really.
and stop touching your face, dave.
okay, we'll put the air lock here.
i want 25 rows of 10 beds apiece.
the most febrile cases at this end.
we'll set up triage outside,
fema can handle food in the basement...
...and we'll need to be operational
within the next 24 to 48 hours.
gotcha.
[mears sighs]
- nice job, dave. this will work.
- thanks.
now find me three more just like it.
[footsteps approaching]
excuse me, dr. mears.
is this coming out of your budget or ours?
[sighs]
who has confirmed
that the hong kong sample...
...matches london,
tokyo and abu dhabi...
...and we're seeing large clusters in
from frankfurt and cairo.
mears [over speaker]:
are we any closer to an index patient?
could be your beth emhoff
or the guy on the bus in japan.
someone else who crawled off the grid.
how you doing?
yeah, good.
i'm going into a meeting with...
no, i didn't ask what you were doing,
i asked how you were doing.
how are you doing?
i'm, uh...
i'm fine.
fine?
you know, i was in the field for 15 years.
i've seen a lot of shit.
if you're not doing fine, you can tell me.
you ever have to tell a man
who just lost his wife and stepson...
...that his wife was cheating on him
before she died?
no, i haven't.
i'm sure you did the best you could.
- uh-uh.
- you sound tired.
you gotta try to remember to sleep
once in a while.
[sighs]
when was the last time you had something
that didn't come out of a vending machine?
taco bell.
local officials are now saying
over 3000 cases have been confirmed...
...in the western suburbs...
...as well as the first cases reported in
ramsey, carlton and saint louis counties...
...as the virus continues to spread.
[doorbell rings]
jory: got it!
- a state health department spokesperson...
...at this hour is appealing to hospitals
as far away as lowa for medicine.
mitch: no, don't open that door.
don't open the door.
- it's andrew.
- uh, sorry, andrew, i can't let you in.
i just came to give my condolences,
mr. emhoff.
i understand. thank you.
uh, but i can't let you in.
i'll just leave them, then.
no, actually, you should take them.
uh, thank you, though.
- i'll call you later.
mitch: bye.
we just, you know,
aren't gonna take any chances.
[chattering over monitor]
woman: do you know how to play this?
- no, i have no idea what's going on.
[chuckling]
but it looks fun.
woman:
you wanna try?
okay.
[women chuckling]
we'll see.
hello. hi.
oh, yeah, my turn, okay.
this one. crab. okay.
man: hey.
- oh! aah!
women:
oh...
oh, my god.
i'll do... what is that? which one is this?
woman: coin.
man: it's a coin.
[speaks indistinctly]
oh, okay, okay, okay.
orantes: it's transmission.
so we just need to know which direction.
[speaks in chinese]
but we don't know where it comes from.
i would like to suggest
that the virus started before macao...
...and maybe here in hong kong.
[in chinese]
man [in chinese]:
[in english] you're considering
pronouncements with serious implications.
a virus is too small to be seen
on video camera.
[mears coughing]
[panting]
[thermometer beeps]
please, god.
no, no, no.
[sobbing]
hello?
this is dr. erin mears in room 821.
i need you to get me the names of everyone
who serviced this room in the last 24 hours.
also, you need to get in touch
with the waiter...
...who brought me my room service
last night.
i need all of their numbers.
home, cell, everything, yes.
[helicopter whirring]
cheever [over phone]:
mears?
dr. cheever...
...i think i'm sick.
what? what's going on?
what kind of symptoms do you have?
can't swallow. severe headache. ahem.
what's your temperature?
- 101.8.
- uh, listen, you can't... you just...
- you can't panic now, okay?
- i know.
- are you alone?
- i've definitely infected other people.
you don't know that.
[sighs]
- so, what should i do?
- well, i want you to stay in your room.
i'll call the health department,
tell them you're there.
- erin, just... you're gonna be okay.
- no, i know. i know.
- okay.
- you gotta send somebody else.
yes, but you don't worry
about that right now, okay?
- hey, i'm...
- you take care of yourself.
i'm sorry i couldn't finish.
that's... never mind that. let me see
what i can do about getting you back here.
- i'm gonna get you home if i can, healthy.
- thank you.
- now, you hang in there.
- bye.
- bye.
- bye.
funeral director: the problem is,
we just can't take delivery of the bodies.
[mitch sighs]
we have insurance issues
with our own employees...
...with our union, not to mention the health
of the mourners, to consider.
i just...
i wanna bury my wife and my stepson...
...and have a service where our friends
and our family can come...
...and pay their respects and grieve.
i understand,
and i am truly sorry about your loss.
have you considered other options?
sarah: how can they do that?
we have a family plot here.
mitch:
they want us to think about cremation.
they just say that it's the safest thing
in a situation like this.
sarah: i wanna be buried
with my daughter and grandson...
...with jack and my parents.
i want us all together.
they're not gonna take them, sarah.
they're not gonna take the bodies.
i'll figure something out.
i'll figure something out.
[sarah sighs]
she made mistakes, mitch...
...but i know she loved you very much.
i'm gonna use some of these
to get us some drinks, okay?
[chattering]
jon [on recording]:
you have not reached jon neal...
...but you will if you leave a message.
[phone beeps]
hi. it's me. um...
i checked the flights,
and i can actually get an earlier flight...
...that would give me a five-hour layover
in chicago...
...so let me know if that's something
that you'd like me to do.
- that's for you, okay?
bartender: oh, thank you.
beth:
thank you very much. thank you.
irina: excuse me.
beth: oh, my god.
[beth chuckles]
thank...
orantes: emhoff gave it to the ukrainian.
sun feng: that just shows contact.
maybe it went the other way.
what about li fai?
- he was on the casino floor.
orantes: watch this.
whoa. oh, good. okay, come on.
let's get one together. ready?
man 1 & man 2:
cheers.
beth:
mm.
man 1:
let's go.
[chattering]
that's him with emhoff at 12:08.
i can show you the ukrainian woman
on the security camera in the elevator...
...going back to her room
she was gone before li fai started work.
it came from here.
emhoff is the index patient.
we need to know everywhere she went
before the casino.
i want to see her itinerary again.
they say the french and americans
have a cure.
they're manufacturing it in secret.
who knows,
but they're in bed with the americans.
- who says?
- the internet.
- the internet? and you believe it?
- i don't know.
how's your mother?
we tried forsythia, but she wasn't strong.
there's a mass grave in lan tau.
i'm sorry.
i'm taking this to the ministry.
we need to send this to geneva.
[in chinese]
sun feng [in english]:
i need you to come with me.
- what are you doing?
- please.
orantes:
no.
what's going on? sun feng.
what's going on? what are you doing?
[door slams]
- what are you doing?
- i'm sorry.
we couldn't wait any longer.
while they cure each other, we're here...
...at the end of the line.
this is what is left of my village.
orantes: are they sick?
sun feng: not yet.
and we're gonna keep it that way.
you'll stay here with us
until they find a cure.
orantes:
how is that gonna help?
you're gonna get us
to the front of the line.
[people coughing]
dave:
dr. mears.
[coughing]
dr. cheever called again.
we're just having a hard time
with the logistics of evacuating you.
finding a plane and all.
i got your phone.
dr. cheever, he asked you to call
if you feel up to it.
now, we're setting up a special ward...
...for medical personnel
and first responders at the university.
i wanna move you there...
...but the nurses' union
is calling a work stoppage...
...until protocols are in place.
there are volunteers, but it's just...
it's hard right now to know
where's the right place.
you're asking me to spend
a lot of resources on one person...
...and right now, i can't do that.
dr. mears would agree with me.
she's one of our own, lyle.
we sent her up there.
okay, i sent her up there.
i would like to go get her back.
we have a plane with an isolation pod...
...to bring our people in the field home
when they're sick, right?
what's going on, lyle?
there's a sick congressman
from illinois in d.c.
he was in chicago over the holiday.
they're using the pod to fly him home.
then they're closing down midway
and o'hare.
the governor is calling the national guard.
they're setting up roadblocks.
they're shutting down trade,
public transportation.
the teamsters are pulling drivers
off the road.
- people are still gonna slip through.
- yes, they will.
the secret service
is moving the president underground.
congress is figuring out
how to work online.
when the word goes out...
...there will be a run on the banks,
gas stations, grocery stores, you name it.
people will panic.
the virus will be the least of our worries.
it will tip over now.
we just need to make sure
that nobody knows until everybody knows.
alan:
my temperature's 101.
higher than it was earlier.
my head hurts...
...and my throat feels like it's closing.
this is forsythia.
i've been taking it
since the onset of the symptoms.
if i'm here tomorrow,
you'll know it works.
truth serum now. i'm alan krumwiede.
aubrey [over phone]:
how many people are gonna die?
well, in 1918...
...1 percent of the population died
from spanish flu.
it was novel, like this,
no one had ever seen it before.
- one percent of america?
- one percent of the world.
as many as 70 million people could die,
baby, maybe more.
- so, what do we do?
- i don't know. we try to figure it out.
this is why i sent mears up there,
to minnesota.
and now i can't get her back.
she's sick, aubrey,
and i can't do anything for her...
...because there are no nurses.
- why not?
- because they're on strike.
- how can they do that?
- because there's nothing they can do.
we're putting healthy people
next to sick people...
...and hoping the healthy people
don't get sick.
- i'm sorry, ellis, but that's not your fault.
- i sent her up there, aubrey.
if one in four are dying, that means
three out of four are living, right?
so the odds are in her favor.
i want you to get in your car
and drive down here to atlanta now.
you hear me, aubrey?
[sighs]
what are you talking about?
i want you to get in your car
and leave chicago.
i want you to drive here to atlanta.
drive by yourself.
you do it. you do it now.
don't tell anyone and don't stop.
stay away from other people, understand?
keep your distance from other people.
call me when you're on the road, aubrey.
roger.
did you hear?
i got people too, dr. cheever.
we all do.
aubrey:
hello?
nygaard [over phone]: hey, friend,
what's up with blowing off dinner?
- i'm sorry, liz.
- why you so flaky? you feeling okay?
this flu sh...
stuff is really spooky.
what does ellis say?
he says it's... he says it's serious.
what do you mean, serious?
where are you?
- i'm getting out of town.
- what?
[sighs]
i'm gonna tell you something...
...and you're not gonna repeat it.
[man coughing]
- cover your mouth, please.
man: fuck off, lady.
pharmacist: we will only be able
to give out 50 doses today.
woman: what?
pharmacist: that's our allotment.
[crowd clamoring]
man:
this is bullshit.
hey. there... excuse me, there's a line here.
excuse me!
[all shouting]
mitch:
jesus.
where's the fire department?
jory:
is anyone even working here?
just get the cereal.
- jory, don't touch anything.
- help me.
mitch:
okay, take your gloves off.
here, give me your hands.
okay. i want you to really rub this in.
okay, okay, come on.
- come on, come on.
man: unh.
mitch:
hey, get away from there. get away.
[helicopter whirring]
lock the door.
guard: get back in your car, sir.
get back in your car.
mitch: no, no, i'm not... i'm immune.
- stay back.
mitch:
i've already had it.
- and my daughter's not sick.
- she's sick?
mitch: she's not, no.
we're just trying to get to wisconsin.
guard: the border is sealed.
the governor has declared a quarantine.
get back in your car.
no, we don't wanna go back there.
we wanna go across.
- there is no way across. get in your car.
- we're not sick.
get back in your car or i will detain you.
where?
get in the car!
[horns honking]
- what happened?
- we have to go home.
[woman coughing]
alan:
what are you doing here?
i think i had a seizure.
oh.
i can't... i can't find any in the stores.
i tried.
look, i don't have any here.
people broke in.
i'm... i'm pregnant, alan.
and i have... i have money.
i can give you some money.
lorraine, you shouldn't be out.
- please, alan.
- go home.
i'll bring it to you when i get it.
[people coughing]
man [shivering]: i was wondering
if i could get another blanket.
this one's very damp now.
nun:
i'm truly sorry, sir. we're out of blankets.
we're hoping for more to be donated.
we put the word out.
what about the heat?
can we turn that up?
i'll find out.
- when did we run out of body bags?
- two days ago.
we're trying to get more in from canada,
but they just wanna wait and see.
crowd [chanting]:
no more lies! no more lies! no more lies!
[thudding on windows]
gupta: there are stories on the internet
that in india and elsewhere...
...the drug ribavirin has been shown
to be effective against this virus.
yet homeland security is telling the cdc
not to make any announcements...
...until stockpiles of the drug
could be secured.
well, dr. gupta, there continue
to be evaluations of several drugs.
ribavirin is among them.
but right now, our best defense
has been social distancing.
no hand-shaking,
staying home when you're sick...
...washing your hands frequently.
can you tell us, to date, how many people
have died from this virus?
very difficult. we're still working
on, uh, confirming that number.
there are 50 different states
in this country...
...which means there are 50 different
health departments...
...followed by 50 different protocols.
let me bring alan krumwiede
into this debate as well.
uh, alan's a freelance journalist.
uh, he was the first
to track the "shinko bus man" video.
uh, alan, today on twitter...
...you wrote that the truth about this virus
is being kept from the world...
...by the cdc,
by the world health organization...
...to allow friends of the administration
to benefit from it...
...both financially and physically.
uh, there are therapies we know
are effective right now, like forsythia...
...and they don't even appear
on the cdc website.
gupta:
on your blog, you also wrote...
...that the world health organization
is in bed with pharmaceutical companies?
because they are.
that's who stands to gain from this.
they're working hand in glove.
and the hand is reaching
into our pockets.
the cdc is exploring forsythia
and other homeopathic treatments.
but right now, there's no science
to back any of these claims.
or no way dr. cheever or the people
who put him into power can profit from it.
we're not ruling anything out.
there are people who are sick,
people who are dying, and we are doing...
they're not keeping us safe from this
any more than...
we're concerned
about every american citizen.
dr. cheever is being a bit disingenuous
when he says "every american citizen."
we're working very hard to find out
where this virus came from, treat it...
...and vaccinate against it if we can.
we don't know all of that yet,
we just don't.
what we do know
is that in order to become sick...
...you have to first come in contact with
a sick person or something they touched.
in order to get scared, all you have to do
is come in contact with a rumor...
...television or the internet.
i think what mr. krumwiede is spreading
is far more dangerous than the disease.
- oh, really?
- yes.
- that's funny.
- what's funny?
you're funny,
because if you check on facebook...
...you'll find a communiqué attributed
to dr. cheever by elizabeth nygaard...
...about the quarantine of chicago hours
before it was announced to the public.
that's why i think
he's a bit disingenuous...
...when he says equal care for all
and not just his friends.
some pretty wild allegations here,
dr. cheever.
can you tell us what communication
appeared and when?
what is the nature of your relationship
with nygaard?
i'm not aware of anything attributed to me
on any social network.
i'm sure you're not. it is there. it is there.
tell them what an r-nought of two
really means, dr. cheever.
teach them some math. hm?
no? i'll do it.
on day 1, there were two people with it,
and then there were four.
and then it was 16,
and you think you've got it in front of you...
...but next it's 256, and then it's 65,000...
...and it's behind you, above you,
and all around you.
in 30 steps, it's a billion sick.
three months.
it's a math problem you can do on a napkin.
and that's where we're headed.
and that's why you won't even tell us
the number of the dead...
...will you, dr. cheever?
but you'll tell your friends
when to get out of chicago...
...before anyone else has a chance.
haggerty:
they're looking for a scapegoat.
you just made it easy.
the only reason we're not taking this
to the attorney general...
...is because we can't replace you
right now.
but there's gonna be an investigation.
do you understand that?
and we don't wanna see you
in front of the cameras anymore.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
where did you come from?
- it's mutated.
cheever: which way, better or worse?
hextall: it's moved into
an african hiv aids population.
the durban cluster is highly divergent.
we have a new r-nought, ellis.
it's not two anymore.
cheever: i thought you said once we could
grow it, we could vaccinate against it.
we tried using dead virus combined
with atrophins to boost immune response.
cheever:
and?
no protective antibodies,
a lot of dead monkeys.
- can you get to the good news?
- now we have to try a live attenuated virus.
- like with polio?
- exactly.
the only danger with a live virus...
...is the possibility that it will revert
to wild type and kill the host.
and when will we know about that?
i'll ask the monkeys.
cheever: as of right now,
the mortality rate is fluctuating...
...between 25 and 30 percent...
...depending upon
underlying medical conditions...
...socioeconomic factors, nutrition,
fresh water.
with the new mutation...
...we are predicting an r-nought
of no less than four.
and without a vaccine,
we can anticipate...
...that approximately one in 12 people
on the planet will contract the disease.
fema worker:
folks, attention.
we appreciate your patience
and we're doing the best we can.
we have exhausted our supply
of meals ready-to-eat for today.
all:
what?
please remain calm. we'll be sending...
please... hey.
can we get some help over here?
[woman grunts]
fema worker:
leave the park in an orderly fashion.
woman:
help me!
- you okay?
woman: thank you.
- sorry, they got one of them.
man: get the trucks!
get the trucks!
[all shouting]
there's... there's nothing in there!
newscaster [on tv]: as the death toll
in the united states is now believed...
...to have reached 2.5 million...
...the president issued a statement today
from an undisclosed location...
...implementing mandatory curfews
in major metropolitan areas...
...after a second consecutive day of riots
in dallas, miami, cleveland and phoenix.
absenteeism in law enforcement
is nearing 25 percent...
...according to reports...
[bang nearby]
[gunshots]
operator [on recording]:
because of the high volume of 911 calls...
...please use the following directory:
if you have symptoms,
please hang up and call 612-188-6336.
to report a death
or for the removal of a body, please press 1.
[sirens wailing]
[knocking on door]
hello? anybody home?
hey, mark?
hey, jor?
jor?
i can't feel my hands.
that messed up my snow angel.
i'm fine, jory.
if neither of us have it,
then we can't give it to each other.
[mitch grunts]
mitch: get away from her.
- dad!
- get away. get away.
- dad!
- what are you doing?
- stay there.
go home, andrew.
get up.
cheever [over phone]:
are we even close?
if we even had a viable vaccine
right now...
...we would still have to do human trials,
and that would take weeks.
and then we would have to
get clearance and approval...
...figure out manufacturing
and distribution.
that would take months.
and then training survivors
to give inoculations.
more months, more deaths.
well, homeland security wants to know...
...if we can put a vaccination
in the water supply, like fluoride.
cure everyone all at once.
[sighs]
i'm going home now, ellis.
it's getting late.
merry christmas.
[line disconnects]
merry christmas.
[chattering]
[man coughing]
mr. hextall: what are you doing?
- it's okay, dad.
- no, it's not okay.
- do you remember dr. barry marshall?
thought that bacteria caused ulcers,
not stress.
gave himself the bug
and then cured himself.
you taught me about him.
i'm testing my vaccine.
no, this is different.
i don't want to get you sick.
ally, you can't take that chance.
oh, dad, you're here
because you stayed in your practice...
...treating sick people
after everyone else went home.
you took that chance.
you took that chance every day.
[whimpers then sobbing]
what?
he won a nobel prize.
- yes, i know, dad. ha, ha.
- barry marshall.
[gasps then whimpers]
newscaster: the food and drug
administration is accelerating approval...
...of the mev-1 vaccine...
...currently in production at five
secret locations in the u.s. and europe...
...saying the first doses could be available
for human use within 90 days.
the who estimates
that it could take nearly a year...
...to manufacture and distribute
the necessary amount of the vaccine...
...to stop the spread of the virus...
...which so far has taken
over 26 million lives worldwide.
but as labs work around the clock
to produce the life-saving formula...
...the question remains: who gets it first?
- don't touch me.
burglar: where is it?
- we don't have it.
- bullshit. he works there. he gets it first.
we don't have it. we have to wait...
[inaudible dialogue]
cheever: aubrey?
aubrey: ellis?
where are you?
aubrey: it's because they saw you on the
news and they heard about what happened.
- you all right?
- they knew where you worked.
they waited for you to leave.
[sighs]
- get up here. come on. let me look at you.
- i tried to stop them.
i tried.
- did they touch you? did they look sick?
- they had masks on, ellis, and gloves.
don't tell me that...
aubrey, we get the vaccine tomorrow.
you have to trust me, ellis.
they didn't touch me.
alan: after the spanish flu in 1918,
you know, people got rich.
the vicks vaporub people,
the lysol people, look it up.
one man dies,
another man makes money off his coffin.
one country culls all their chickens,
red meat goes into higher demand.
i'm not the first person to make money...
...off the fact that our immune system
is a work in progress.
the pharmaceutical industry
do it every quarter.
i don't think anyone is immune
to opportunity, alan.
it's just that studies show
that there is no proof that forsythia works.
who conducted the studies?
what defines "works"?
against what strain of the virus?
did you know about the studies
when we met the last time?
we can get in a lot of trouble...
do you really think this dr. hextall
cdc person is jesus in a lab coat?
the government rushed the trials.
the lawyers indemnified
the drug companies.
maybe it causes autism or narcolepsy
or cancer 10 years from now.
who knows?
you... the...
the swine flu vaccine killed people
back in 1976.
nerve disease.
so we're all guinea pigs,
starting from today.
just wait, they'll start listing side effects
like the credits at the end of a movie.
people trust you, alan.
if you tell them not to take it...
that's right.
they trust me.
all 12 million unique visitors.
i'm a trusted man
stepping up to a microphone...
...in front of a very large crowd.
that's who i am. that's the brand.
i say the right thing,
nobody shows up for their shot.
maybe they'd rather roll the dice
with forsythia.
i can make that happen.
i just wanna know
i'm in the best position possible when i do.
what does that mean, exactly?
if i'm gonna step into the crosshairs,
i wanna know what's in...
- is he with you?
- what? who?
are you wearing a wire?
alan, i didn't have a choice.
they've seen your blog.
agent 1:
get him.
[agent 2 speaks indistinctly]
agent 3: far enough, far enough.
- for what? tell me, for what?
securities fraud, conspiracy,
and most likely manslaughter.
alan: it cured me. forsythia cured me.
- we'll see, alan.
this is entrapment.
you can't take my blood.
you can't, that's my property.
we may never know
where this disease came from.
but we do know
that this vaccine is the result...
...of the courage and perseverance
of a remarkable few.
we shall now begin the drawing. john.
the first mev-1 vaccination...
...are those people born on march 10th.
march 10th.
we remind all of you
to stay 10 feet apart from each other...
...while on line.
[typing on keyboard]
shouldn't you be downstairs?
hextall:
i'm tracking vaccine batch numbers.
this is what you have to be doing
right this minute?
this is what i want to do
right this minute.
[cheever sighs]
take a bow, ally.
people have for a lot less.
it's not that hard
to give yourself an injection.
what about mears or my father or you?
i'm gonna take a bow
while you get hauled in front of congress?
what do i say when they ask about that?
you tell them that i told a loved one
who told a loved one...
...and that i'd do it again.
without you...
ally, you have saved millions of lives.
that's a great story.
it also happens to be true.
now, how often can you say that?
the next citizens to receive
the mev-1 vaccination...
...are those born on the date...
what is that? january 11th.
okay. all right, 144.
that's... ahem. there's still, uh, 200...
more than 200 birthdays, hon,
that haven't been called, so that's good.
that's a good number.
- what if they run out?
- they're not gonna run out.
they have enough to keep up with demand.
they said that already.
maybe i'm immune like you
and i don't even need it.
that's not a chance we're gonna take.
so instead we lose spring,
we lose summer...
...we lose another 144 days
that don't happen again.
why can't they invent a shot
that keeps time from passing?
mitch: it's gonna start
getting normal again, jory.
[sighing]
[chattering]
how do you call this, "fish," in chinese?
this is yú.
[speaks in chinese]
- this is beautiful.
- thank you.
sun feng:
it's time. we have to run. he just landed.
i want you to keep drawing...
...and assand will come
and finish the class, all right?
i'll see you soon.
- see you.
- see you.
sun feng: tsuen wan cemetery
off the number 3 expressway.
it's close to where you are now.
in 15 minutes.
one hundred doses.
nobody from the ministry, no police.
if we see anybody else, any other vehicles,
you'll never see her again.
yes?
yes, i'm fine.
please give them what they ask.
i just wanna go home.
sun feng: once we have the vaccine,
we'll tell you where to find her.
- is it french or american?
- we could not get enough from the french.
it's been made here.
the same formula, though.
it is effective, i promise.
there, be careful.
wait, where is she?
sun feng: we don't know what it is.
- well, we have no choice.
where is dr. orantes?
[sniffing]
[in chinese]
now, wait, this is not what we agreed on.
are you okay?
yes, i'm fine.
i'm good.
leopold:
oh, i almost forgot.
- what's that?
- your vaccine.
the one you took was a placebo.
what?
the chinese insisted. there have been
many abductions, not just here.
in russia, mexico, all over.
government officials, scientists,
or westerners with great wealth.
mostly perpetrated by organized crime
or revolutionary groups...
...trying to extort medicines.
the chinese don't negotiate
with kidnappers. it wasn't up to us.
we've got a limited supply,
just like everyone else.
leo... leonora.
where are you going?
[scanner beeps]
[easy listening music
playing over speakers]
[beeps]
french:
blood results came back, mr. krumwiede.
you never had the virus.
you have no antibodies. you lied.
of course that's what your labs say.
forsythia is a lie.
it's a lie,
and you made $4.5 million for telling it.
you wanna blog about that?
you are going to go away, mr. krumwiede,
and so is all your money.
i can't even imagine all the civil suits
people are gonna file against you...
...and i have a pretty good imagination.
now you wanna tell people
not to get vaccinated...
...when that's the best chance
they've got.
if i could throw your computer in jail,
i would.
[whispers]
made bail.
are we done here?
evidently, there are 12 million other people
as crazy as you are.
you made bail. congratulations.
cheever and wife.
congratulate aubrey for me.
i'd shake your hand,
but i don't wanna set a bad example.
um, we're gonna have an official reception
when we can get everybody in one place...
...and we really hope you can be with us.
sure. so are you ready for yours?
i've got mine.
no, i think she's gonna
wanna do these together.
- i know she sprang for some champagne.
- hm.
they have scheduled the hearings.
we'll both be expected to testify.
right.
good luck.
head back, anthony.
there you go.
[sniffing]
good job.
i can't give him the bracelet,
but at least you know he'll be safe.
yeah, beats waiting
another seven months.
okay, what do you say?
- thank you.
- you're welcome, anthony.
you know where this comes from,
shaking hands?
no.
it was a way of showing a stranger you
weren't carrying a weapon in the old days.
- good job. now go finish your homework.
- okay.
yeah.
you offered your empty right hand
to show that you meant no harm.
- oh, i didn't know that.
- i wonder if the virus does.
well, dr. cheever, thanks.
take care, roger.
you too.
aubrey: you're not gonna
get in trouble for this, are you?
cheever:
will you be quiet?
aubrey:
my number is 287, ellis.
if we weren't married,
i'd have to wait almost a year.
then it's a good thing we're married.
hold your head back.
i don't wanna give them another reason
to go after you.
will you please be quiet
and hold your head back?
okay, go.
[sniffing]
- good.
- mm.
and go.
good.
[sighing]
all right.
like you said, baby...
...just taking care of everybody
that's in my lifeboat.
[inaudible dialogue]
[u2's "all i want is you" playing]
[doorbell rings]
you say you want
diamonds on a ring of gold
you say you want
your story to remain untold
but all the promises we make
from the cradle to the grave
jory:
dad, are you coming?
mitch:
yep.
i'm just looking for the camera.
[sighs]
you say you'll give me
a highway with no one on it
[sobs]
treasure just to look upon it
all the riches in the night
you say you'll give me
eyes in a moon of blindness
a river in a time of dryness
a harbor in the tempest
but all the promises we make
from the cradle to the grave
when all i want is you
[inaudible dialogue]
