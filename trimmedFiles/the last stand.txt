is doing out here firing
rockets at a slab of beef?
afternoon, ray.
do you have a permit for that monster?
yeah. right here.
why don't you get him a towel or something?
he's messing up his uniform.
and you. clean that
chunk of beef off your hat.
i got a chunk of beef? oh!

sorry.
- there you go.
- thank you.
ray, i'm really sorry.
ray?
we were just having a little fun.
not much to do in town.
it's pretty dead over there and...
you know, we need something to do.
- oh, really?
- yeah.
i got something for you.
okay.
a couple of truckers that stopped in town.
weren't too happy to see me.
there's something off about them.
run those plates for me.
i'm on it, sheriff.
if you get a hit, pass
it on to the troopers.
wow, you're looking jacked, ray.
you've been working out?
i warned him about the recoil.
give me that damn thing.
and let me have a go.
before i change my mind
and write you a citation.
we've secured the location.
okay. are we all ready?
- game on, boss.
- love it.
- yeah, boss?
- huh?
we had some trouble with the farmer.
what? can't handle one farmer?
tell you what, go.
let's get started!
i'll talk to him.
i'm great when it comes to farmers.
howdy.
how's it going?
be going a lot better if you tell me
what the hell you're doing on my property.
my name's burrell.
you see, i'm shooting a commercial.
i'm sure you've seen one on tv.
and your property would be just perfect...
hey.
get the hell off of my property.
the company i'm working for
is gonna pay you a lotta money.
you don't have to do a damn thing.
did you hear what i said?
huh?
don't you at least wanna hear
what i have to offer?
no.
you wanna hear my offer?
you clear out now
and i won't fill your ass full of buckshot.
old man, you better put that piece away
before you blow your toes off.
- we just talkin' here.
now we finished talkin'.
you get the hell outta here!
okay.
that's your decision.
you don't want to take the silver?
better take the lead.
what i'm trying to say
is, it's embarrassing
to have to lock up
your ex-boyfriend.
whose fault is that?
the person who stole. you.
i mean, whose fault is it we're exes?
we're not talking about that right now.
- yes, we are.
- mmm-mmm.
i mean, we're talking about something else,
but we're really talking about that.
you have an aspirin?
this isn't the nurse's office.
i mean, what is wrong with you?
- oh, my god.
- you had everything.
you were smart. you were popular.
uh, you were a great athlete.
i mean, hell, you had
a full ride through college
had you not gotten yourself
kicked off the track team.
you really wanna do this? okay.
i've sewed my country in
fuckin' iraq and afghanistan.
no, we're not talking
about the war, okay?
we're talking about you being locked up
for "drunk and disorderly."
what do you care, if we're not together?
hey, sarah.
what's up, frank?
what's up, buddy.
ow. okay.
that was awkward.
hey, are you two dating again?
- maybe.
- no.
do we really have to
keep him locked up in here?
yes!
why?
because the boss said
i gotta keep you locked up
for the weekend.
that's why.
uh...
could you show me
how to run these plates?
here, gimme that.
okay.
i'm just doing this once, okay?
- i know.
- pay attention.
hi, ray...
damn.
the plates on that truck checked out.
nevada registry.
driver is one burrell thomas.
clean record.
great.
- good work.
- thanks.
i'm sure you didn't come
all the way over here
to just tell me that.
i need to make a move.
go someplace where there's some action.
where i can make a difference.
like when you worked narcotics in l.a.
i just don't understand
how you ever gave it up
to come to this place.
most exciting thing i've done
in the past four days is
rescue a cat out of a tree.
sommerton has its charms.
maybe. i...
i've just never been out of it
and i'm going stir crazy here.
do you think you could
help me get a job in l.a.?
l.a. is not all you think it is.
look...
i understand that you want to move on.
you're young.
you want to experience adventure.
when i was your age,
all i wanted to do
was to move to los angeles.
i wanted to be part of the action.
but now,
thinking back, i feel differently.
but if that's what you really want...
of course, i'll help you.
morning.
thank you for coming on such short notice
at such an early hour.
this is a top-secret operation.
in 45 seconds we'll move a prisoner
to federal death row.
that prisoner is gabriel cortez.
cortez is the most vicious cartel boss
since pablo escobar.
let's make sure this guy
never sees the light of day again.
we will travel underneath the radar.
let's do this.
<i>convoy is
holding at position alpha.</i>
<i>awaiting clearance to proceed.
please advise.</i>
what the hell? jesus christ! shit!
watch your mark! on me!
alpha team!
- spread out!

john! i'll cover the alley!
good. mckay, you go with her.
hrt, you take the stairwells.
you two guys, come with me.
shut down the elevators.
the rest of you, secure this place.
nobody gets in or out.
- ready.
- let's do it.
seven more flights!
move! move! move!
pick it up, gentlemen! pick it up!
here!
i need backup and air support.
medic!
let's go!
<i>hrt, report.</i>
we got two agents down. cortez is gone.
hey!
stop! fbi!
cut him off! cut him off!
stop!
show me your hands!
don't fucking move!
check him.
- it's not him.
- oh, my god.
it's not him.
stop! fbi!
son of a bitch!
mckay!
<i>richards,
what do you see? tell me.</i>
all quiet in the rear entrance.
we're checking the alley now.
john!
<i>richards?</i>
<i>- richards!</i>
<i>do you copy?</i>
<i>richards?</i>
don't.
it's mckay, isn't it?
baby on the way, right?
put the gun down.
richards? richards?
- man down! man down!
- i got it!
shit!
yeah? yeah?
no.
<i>i want you to shut down every</i>
private airfield and landing strip
in a 100-mile radius.
i don't care how small.
that's gonna take some doing.
then get doing.
you need to check every building
that has a camera facing the street.
i want you to check that and see
if we can get an id or a license plate.
how much did he pay you?
he doesn't know what you're talking about.
oh, you think i'm an idiot?
do i look like an idiot to you?
you want me to ask him that?
no, i want you
to ask him why he's wearing that.
why is he dressed that way?
why are you dressed like that?
he says he supports
the national dutch football team.
what the fuck
is that supposed to mean?
the soccer team.
he's wearing their team colors.
you guys fucking with me or what?
all right, i'll play this game.
what country do dutch people come from?
he says that his arm hurts
from where you grabbed him.
he was reaching for something.
i was worried for my life.
so i tried to hit you.
i shoulda hit you the fuck harder.
that's such bullshit.
oh, so now you speak english?
if you knew any spanish,
you'd know i was barely
speaking it a minute ago.
all right, smartass,
what were you doing out at 4:00 a.m.?
it's vegas, man!
sir? we have something.
owens here. what's up?
<i>hi, sheriff. it's christie.</i>
did i wake you up?
oh, no, no, no.
<i>i was already busy.
what can i do for you?</i>
well, i just came in to open up the diner
and the milk hasn't been delivered yet.
is this really a police matter?
mr. parsons always delivers
fresh milk first thing.
<i>he's a very early riser, you know.</i>
<i>i don't care about the milk.</i>
<i>nobody's even around this weekend,</i>
<i>but that man hasn't missed a delivery</i>
<i>ever since i can remember.</i>
<i>and i'm worried about him.</i>
have you ever thought
about calling him?
<i>stubborn old bastard
doesn't have a phone out there.</i>
oh, that's right.
i forgot.
i'm just afraid he had
a heart attack or something.
sorry to wake you. i...
there's just nobody else around
<i>and i didn't know who else to call.</i>
no, you did the right thing, christie.
i'm gonna send a deputy out there.
and i'm gonna have 'em
check up on him. all right?
- thanks, sheriff.
- all right. bye-bye.
cortez and his crew,
they dumped the white sedan
and they got into two separate cars.
and as of right now
we think that cortez is in this one.
hold that right there.
what is that?
where's mitchell? he knows cars.
mitchell! come here.
sir.
blow that up.
aaron. aaron, what kind of car is this?
uh, i think it's a zr1.
what the hell is a zr1?
a corvette zr1.
this one is a specially modified show car.
it's a monster on wheels.
it was all over the news,
like, two days ago.
got stolen from the la auto show.
normally, something around,
you know, 700 horsepower.
but this has upwards of 1,000.
i got a psychopath in the batmobile.
how am i supposed to stop that?
uh, blow it up?
what if there's a hostage inside?
uh...
all right. let's get this
out to everybody in intel.
this is the car we're
looking for right here.
<i>the car we 're looking for
is a modified version</i>
<i>of a corvette zr1.</i>
yeah, i'm looking at a picture now.
i'll let you know
when he reaches our position.
<i>be prepared to show</i>
<i>your vehicle registration
and identification.</i>
officer.
license and registration.
yes, sir.
here's my license.
registration.
go, go, go! all units, calling in!
hey! hey! hold up, cowboy.
you don't sneak up on old man parsons.
you know what he's like.
okay?
hey, mr. parsons!
it's jerry bailey!
we just come by to check up on you,
so please don't take
any shots at us, okay? oh!
shit.
all right. let's check around back.
yeah.
damn it.
come on.
psst!
hamburglar!
you wanna try the door first?
mr. parsons?
i'll check upstairs.
you check the ground floor.
okay.
cortez just blew
through their checkpoint.
but all airfields are closed,
so he won't be flying out.
i want a roadblock here. bullhead city.
nothing gets through.
what the hell is he trying to do?
southbound on 95?
he thinks he's getting to mexico,
but that's not gonna happen.
why doesn't he just take a chopper?
uh, the zr1 is faster than any chopper.
it's more than that.
cortez, he's third generation cartel boss.
he thinks he's untouchable.
that's how his mind works.
he wants to be behind the wheel. literally.
what do you mean?
cortez has been racing cars
since he was a teenager.
his father built him
his own track in sinaloa.
he's been racing on the pro circuit
in south america under a pseudonym.
i saw him drive. he's good.
quiet!
quiet!
bannister.
<i>are you having a nice day?</i>
it's gonna be.
this can only end one of two ways.
and you know what?
i'm fine with either one of them.
<i>with your pretty little
agent dead or alive?</i>
<i>i can cut her up in 100 pieces</i>
<i>and mail them back to you one by one.</i>
<i>is that what you want?</i>
you've already killed
one federal agent, gabriel.
you kill another one and i guarantee you
this world is not big enough
for you to hide in.
<i>how are you gonna explain to her parents</i>
<i>why their daughter is returning home</i>
<i>in plastic bags?</i>
<i>here's how it's gonna go, john.</i>
<i>you pull your men back
and stay the fuck out of my way</i>
<i>or your agent is roadkill.</i>
<i>i'm good either way.</i>
just let me talk to her.
<i>i'm sorry, john.</i>
<i>i really screwed this up. i'm so sorry.</i>
i'm gonna get you outta this.
all right? don't worry.
<i>i'm gonna get you outta this.</i>
if you try to stop me,
a lot of people who don't have to
<i>are gonna die.
it's your choice how to play this.</i>
right now, i'm just a guy
out for a nice drive.
so much for blowing him up.
shut the fuck up!
yeah?
<i>ray, we're here at parsons'.
we found his body.</i>
<i>he's been murdered.</i>
we've got a positive id.
a cyber gray metallic zr1
headed southbound on us 95.
<i>hostage is visible inside the vehicle.</i>
- he's almost on you, chief.
<i>- copy that.</i>
don't worry. we're ready for this guy.
<i>lot of people have said that.</i>
<i>cortez has a way of proving 'em wrong.</i>
<i>i need you to be alert.</i>
and you need to remind your men
that there's a hostage in that vehicle.
<i>coming up on the arizona border.</i>
he'll be on top of you soon.
copy that.
<i>everything is in place.</i>
five minutes. move.
get comfy.
i want you to have a good view of the show.
what?
oh!
fall back!
let's go! get back now!
fall back! back!
back up!
good god.
the barricade's
been completely destroyed.
<i>looks like a warzone down there.</i>
<i>we've got several officers down.</i>
fuck!
i'm on my way.
now remember, this is a crime scene.
don't touch anything.
uh, 10-4 on that.
okay, so the way i see it,
we got a busted window.
all right. it looks like
a burglary gone bad to me.
i figure what parsons did was came in
and he surprised 'em maybe.
yeah. coulda been that.
did anyone check for tire tracks yet?
they were here first.
um... i'll go check.
stay together.
yes, sir.
show me the body.
right over here.
oh, jesus.
no burn mark on the entry wound.
bullet passed clean through.
pistol round didn't do this.
can you tell which way they went?
towards the canyon.
let's go.
three million dollars in swiss accounts
per our agreement.
you know, in my country,
the police say "gracias"
after being paid off.
if you're gonna continue
to drive like a maniac,
can i stop playing hostage now?
oops. sorry.
what is that?
excitement.
- what?
shit! i just lost visual.
<i>we just lost visual.</i>
how? how? get it back!
we're going around.
he's gone.
what do you mean, "he's gone"?
just... just keep looking.
you gotta keep looking!
keep looking! find him!
<i>we lost him. we'll stay on it.</i>
what the fuck?
he was killed outside.
his body was moved inside, after the fact.
how quickly can cortez make the border?
at the speed he's going, 65, 75 minutes.
little patch of border he's headed towards
is mostly deep canyon.
can you bring that up for me? please?
only crossing point is here. los algodones.
i know the cbp agent in charge down there.
he's a hard ass.
and the border crossing
was just rebuilt last year.
concrete blast walls.
in-ground retractable steel barriers.
it's a fortress.
cortez isn't racing towards a target
without a strategy to get through.
so whatever he's planning,
we gotta be ready for it.
start moving assets to algodones.
reinforce that crossing, all right?
all right. what about this town?
sommerton junction.
there's no official crossing
but it's the closest point in his path.
hang on.
ravine is too deep to cross.
it's a long shot.
let's not ignore it though.
i'll give the sheriff a call.
tell him to keep outta the way.
yeah?
<i>sheriff owens?</i>
that's me. who am i talking to?
john bannister with the fbi.
we have a situation.
well, talk to me.
<i>i have a violent fugitive</i>
making a run for the mexican border.
now there's a small chance
<i>that he may try to cross in sommerton.</i>
it's unlikely that
he'll be coming your way,
but i'm gonna send over
a swat team from ei centro
just in case.
no offense, but i want them handling this.
<i>listen, i can't talk now. i got to go.</i>
what's up?
well, i don't know.
the fbi says there's an escaped fugitive
that might be heading our way.
shit. when it rains it pours.
this is no coincidence.
first the guys at the diner. now this.
it's all connected.
we got to reach bailey and torrance.
shit.
what's that light over there?
- huh.
- do you think it's them?
do you think the killer is stupid enough
to hang around here?
damn it. give me the glock.
stop the car. stop the car.
what the hell is that?
<i>bailey, torrance, where are you?</i>
we followed some tire tracks
to the canyon edge
at the south side of town.
there's someone out here.
we're checking it out on foot.
negative. you're to fall back immediately.
<i>do you copy?</i>
give me this.
ray, we got work lights.
something big is going on here.
ray, do you copy?
ray, do you copy?
stop!
oh, god!
jerry, move!
- cover!
- go!
<i>what the hell
is going on out there?</i>
shit!
we're taking fire. multiple shooters.
i'm almost there.
nvgs on.
kill the lights. now.
what?
what?
you okay, jerry?
can you make it to me?
yeah.
yeah.
no.
no.
shit!
bailey's over there. he's been hit.
- i'll cover you.
- all right.
bring me the gun!
bailey, come here, you gotta get up.
get up. bailey, you gotta get up.
shit.
shit!
go! go, go, go, go, go!
is anyone following us?
<i>that's a negative.
i didn't see any headlights.</i>
good.
are you both okay?
oh, my god, jerry, you're still bleeding.
this is nothing.
- ray?
- find the wound
and apply pressure.
okay.
ah!
- i'm sorry.
it's okay. it's okay.
careful.
i hear uniform bloodstains
take forever to scrub out.
yeah, well, what do i care?
you're the one that's
gonna be cleaning it for me anyway
as soon as we get you patched up.
you think frank would be jealous
if he saw the two of us like this?
you know,
you can just tell your buddy that, um,
he's wasting his time. you know?
i don't date prisoners.
he likes you, too.
okay.
hang on, jerry. please hang on.
jerry? hang on, jerry!
ray, hurry!
i got you.
come on, jerry.
it's okay. you're gonna be okay.
jerry?
come on.
oh, ray.
oh, jerry.
sarah!
sarah!
can't believe he's gone.
he was talking about you
only minutes before he died.
what did he say?
he told me to go easy on you.
that you're not all that bad.
what do you mean, "cops gave you trouble"?
<i>- what kind of trouble?</i>
- listen...
are you gonna be ready on time?
yes.
not gonna be a problem.
i expect you to complete your mission.
i don't wanna hear any excuses.
oh, shit.
<i>bannister here.</i>
how far out is the swat team?
<i>because i need your help.</i>
your fugitive is trying to cross the border
right around here.
what are you talking about?
there's no crossing in sommerton.
<i>they're going to build one.</i>
because the canyon
south of town here is very narrow.
there's a whole team out there.
military background. heavy weapons.
they're building a mobile assault bridge
across that canyon.
oh, really? you think so?
<i>i know so. i've seen them.</i>
we even engaged
in a firefight with those guys.
<i>now, who the hell is this fugitive anyway?</i>
gabriel cortez.
what?
<i>now, why the fuck didn't you
tell me that earlier?</i>
my deputy would still
be alive if i would have known that!
you know what? i don't have time
to explain every little detail to you.
why don't you go out there
and patrol or something like that?
look, i don't know you.
and i don't answer to you.
that son of a bitch.
hung up on me again.
piss-ant country sheriff.
phil? get me the swat captain, all right?
got it.
and throw up
a map of sommerton up here for me.
i wanna check something out.
- sir?
<i>- captain,</i>
there's a chance cortez may actually
try to cross in sommerton.
<i>when you get there,
if you find a bridge, destroy it.</i>
yes, sir.
mobile assault bridge.
that's swat up ahead.
what are you gonna do?
death doesn't come when you expect it.
driving a racecar.
or in a gunfight.
death is waiting in the kitchen
when you get up at night
for a glass of milk.
my niece.
my sister's oldest. she was a good girl.
i practically raised her.
then one night i find her
pointing a glock at me in the kitchen.
if she hadn't hesitated,
it would have been my brains
splattered all over
the marble floor instead of hers.
shit!
shit!
don't try to see death coming. you won't.
swat's not coming.
so we're on our own?
well, then who's gonna
stop this guy cortez?
this is on the feds.
he was in their custody. they lost him.
he should have never been our problem.
maybe not.
but if he comes through our town,
he will be our problem.
okay, so.
we could turn our back for a half hour.
we could do that.
if we do that
we might as well throw these in the trash.
ray, let it go.
i can't.
jerry's dead because of that guy.
ray.
you know me. i'm not a coward.
look, i would
more than happily draw down
on those guys with you for jerry.
but cortez, he's out of our league.
he's got an army.
look,
if you guys want to just step aside,
that's fine with me.
i'm not gonna fault you for doing so.
but i'm not gonna
let that guy come through our town
without a fight.
i took the same oath as you, ray.
ray...
looks like you're a little short-handed.
you need my help.
are you still as good a shot
as you used to be?
muscle memory lasts a long time.
frank, i've seen you start
a lotta things you didn't finish.
jerry was my friend.
i've never quit on my friends.
set him free.
consider yourself deputized.
i won't let you down.
okay, okay.
that makes four of us.
you happy?
phil...
i want you to pull
financials on everybody in this division.
including me. no exceptions.
cortez has somebody on the inside.
somebody who tipped him off
when we we're about to move him.
and i wanna know who it is.
all right?
ray, i, um...
i gotta tell you,
when jerry and i were being shot at,
i was scared shitless.
i mean, i could barely
keep my hands from shaking.
that's quite normal.
i mean, everyone feels like
that during a firefight.
i'll tell you a secret.
i'm probably more afraid
than you are right now.
whoa... what?
how can that be?
because i've seen enough blood and death.
i know what's coming.
i want you to ask washington to get us
real time satellite imagery
of the area surrounding sommerton.
you know, if the sheriff is right,
then we got 100 federal agents
standing around los algodones crossing
with their dicks in their
hands for no reason.
what's the fastest way to get there?
uh, we can charter a jet out of mccarren.
do it.
ready?
yeah, but how are we gonna go up
against all that firepower
with a bunch of shotguns and knives?
i got an idea.
i got two conditions that need to be met
before we do anything.
well, name it.
i want to be deputized like frank here
so any damage caused to or by me
will be official business of
the sommerton junction sheriff's office.
put your hand on it.
i do hereby instate one lewis dinkum
to serve as deputy from this day forward.
or until his services
are no longer required
by the people of sommerton junction.
- witness?
- witness.
what else? huh?
second condition.
oh! i wanna hang on to old georgietta here
seeing as i'm the only
one fit to handle her.
all right. let's go.
i mean, you can handle her too, ray.
you too, frank.
you might be able to handle her.
- well, thanks, lewis.
- okay, let's go.
<i>voila!</i>
- jesus christ, lewis!
- holy shit!
what a beauty!
where the hell did you get this?
vicki? she's my little nazi killer.
my little crazy bitch.
course, she can't really
fire in the legal sense, though.
but i did run down
all the missing parts for her
so she could function theoretically.
course, that's between us and jesus.
uncle sam don't need
to know nothin' about that.
you have more ammo?
few rounds.
well, bring everything you got.
what, do you think
we're fighting in a crusade?
you never know.
we meet on main street in five.
we need as many vehicles as possible.
for the blockade.
i'll drive old henrietta here.
do you have stupid names
for all your shit?
only the shit i love.
let's go.
all right, i'll brief
you when we touch down.
update me.
border patrol's putting a team together
but they won't be there for over an hour.
- national guard?
- longer.
what about the military?
takes a presidential order.
we're not gonna get that
in the next 45 minutes.
now cortez has to come through main street
in order to get to the canyon.
the only other option is alzamora.
torrance, you take
frank and lewis and block that off.
and figgy and i,
we're gonna warn the civilians.
- got it.
- ha!
hey, ray.
listen, guys.
there's an escaped fugitive
coming through town.
it's too dangerous for you to stay here.
i want everyone to go home.
did you hear what i just said?
we just ordered breakfast.
it's for your own safety.
you're talking to a 72-year-old man
with high cholesterol,
eating a bacon and cheddar
omelet with extra cheddar.
do i look like i'm afraid of death?
don't look at me.
i ordered the same thing.
i just started cooking.
where's christie?
went to get milk.
just stay away from the windows, okay?
stay away from the windows.
okay.
we can do that.
all right. how do you wanna do this?
all right.
let's put your truck on the far side
and then find some more cars to use.
i got a better idea.
we might need something bigger.
yeah. maybe three on this side.
that should be enough to fill it in.
hey!
what are you planning to do?
just stay back.
no, dinkum, what about the lines?
this is the phone and cable.
electricity's over there.
no, that's not what i mean.
if you cut the pole,
the lines will keep it from falling!
whoo!
geronimo! geronimo!
- get back! get back!
- oh, shit!
oops.
fucking perfect.
let's get some cars in place.
well, shit!
jesus.
john, better take a look at this.
what is it?
the satellite feed from homeland security.
this is a live view of the canyon
just south of sommerton junction.
look at that.
- that's a bridge.
- yeah.
i don't believe it.
sheriff was right.
who is this guy?
in 1988, owens joined the lapd.
he trained under their
elite tactical division.
worked narcotics for five
years, then he quit.
why?
he crashed a party on some bad guys
moving a half-ton of coke.
took home the medal of valor
and five bullet holes for his trouble.
owens lived but seven other cops didn't.
so that was it for owens.
guess he'd seen enough bloodshed,
so he walked away
and went to sommerton to play sheriff.
uh-huh.
thanks.
yeah, we need two more.
oh, my god!
what are you doing, dinkum?
have you lost your mind, you idiot?
settle down. i almost got it.
- dinkum!
- don't do that!
dinkum! dinkum! are you okay?
oh, my god! are you all right?
henrietta!
it worked!
nice job, deputy. nice job.
ray, we're gonna need
something bigger than this.
i got an idea.
torrance.
<i>alzamora's blocked off.</i>
good. have dinkum and martinez
meet me at the schoolyard.
and i need you to be on top of the roof
of the old hotel to be my spotter.
figgy, you go to the south side and check
if the buildings are cleared, okay?
- i'll be right back.
- on my way.
time for a turkey shoot.
oh, shit.
i got guys on main street
approaching from the south.
<i>do not engage.
wait for us to get there.</i>
copy that, ray.
what the hell is that?
this is gonna be a lotta fun!
i'll need two guys on the left.
and two take the right.
you can shoot anything that moves.
if it doesn't move, shoot it anyway.
once our work is done here
we're gonna burn this place to the ground!
oh, man!
christie! christie!
jesus, figgy!
christie, you gotta get outta here now!
what the hell is going on?
what are these cars parked for?
look at that ass.
christie, you gotta get
off the street, baby!
why are you hiding behind a car?
i could kill for that ass.
oh, shit!
come on! come on!
go! go!
go! get down! get down!
come on! come on! go!
get to the diner! get to the diner!
fuck!
that's the best you got?
oh, no!
look at that squirrel
in that big motherfucker hat.
this is getting boring. get the big gun!
oh, shit, oh, shit.
yeah. give him something to remember.
oh, shit!
whoa.
huh?
take him out!
get him!
figgy!
all clear. barricade...
what the fuck happened?
<i>torrance, are you okay?</i>
i'm okay, ray!
but figgy's down.
now, what the hell is that?
oh, shit!
welcome to sommerton.
nice shootin', sheriff.
get this bus into position!
ow!
- i got it! i'm on it!
- let's go! let's go!
we're in place!
get down, ray!
fuck!
torrance, where is the fire coming from?
behind you. roof next to the diner.
cover me, guys.
yes, sir!
how are you, sheriff?
old.
nah, you got a ways to go yet.
oh, my god, sheriff, you've been shot.
somebody help him.
- i see it. hold on.
- don't worry. it's just glass.
where are the stairs to the roof?
there.
he's going after sarah.
we have to warn her. give me the radio.
- huh?
- the radio.
- we don't got no damn radio.
- what?
we got numchucks though.
- just cover me.
- me cover you?
what the hell?
sarah!
does this mean i'm forgiven?
probably.
ah, shit! oh, fuck.
oh, shit!
georgietta!
god damn cowbell!
fuck!
oh, jesus.
motherfucker.
no trespassing.
- quiet, granny.
- ah!
mrs. salazar!
sheriff!
obliged.
put the hurt on 'em, ray!
okay.
- figgy.
- lewis! what are you doing?
figgy's over here!
fuck!
ray!
you get dinkum. i'll cover you.
gotcha.
come on.
come on.
- oh, jesus.
what are you doing out there?
- i'm a deputy.
- shh!
lewis...
hey!
here i am!
you little motherfucker.
come on! shoot!
where the fuck are you?
little rat. you wanna play?
i love to play.
okay.
oh, shit!
drop the weapon.
who the hell are you?
i am the sheriff.
<i>i'm here.</i>
<i>do you copy?</i>
<i>are you ready for me?</i>
we will be.
oh!
you're very good
in close quarters, aren't you?
you're very beautiful, agent richards.
and nothing would
give me greater pleasure
than to demonstrate
how good i really am.
but since you're still gonna need
to look the part of an escaped hostage,
consider this a goodbye gift.
what do you mean?
what the fuck?
oh, shit!
so you wanna play? let's play.
yeah!
now what?
fuck!
shit!
son of a bitch!
fuck!
i'm gonna kill you!
no!
shit!
you fucked up my car.
you fucked up my day off.
you know what, sheriff?
all you have to do is
just let me walk across that border.
hell, 12,000 mexicans
come across every day.
you shouldn't mind if one goes back.
huh?
what do you say?
you make us immigrants look bad.
well, then let's discuss
my deportation, shall we?
this is my personal banker.
simply tell him your account number.
you will be $5 million richer.
and we will part as friends.
ten million.
put those on, or i will.
maybe once upon a time.
your time is over, <i>abuelito.</i>
my time is just starting.
game on.
you should have taken the money, old man.
okay, okay!
twenty million!
$20 million just to look the other way.
my honor is not for sale.
fuck your honor!
you are under arrest.
here comes the cavalry.
john bannister, fbi.
glad you could make it.
so what happened here? where's cortez?
the sheriff went after him.
i'm more concerned about him right now
than i am about cortez.
looks like you're both in luck.
well, look at that.
- good for him.
good for him.
for the last time.
only this time, surprise is on you.
let's go, guys.
john! john!
richards.
you okay?
yeah. i'm okay. i'm so sorry, john.
he was gonna kill me.
it's so good to see you.
yeah. i'm glad he didn't.
i'm really glad he didn't.
'cause that would have
cost me the satisfaction
of being able to arrest you myself.
i believe the two of you
are already used to
being driving buddies.
and for your information,
swiss bank accounts
are not as secret as they used to be.
let's go.
shit.
that's why i shot him!
i can walk!
just because a man gets
wounded in the line of duty
don't mean he can't walk.
i don't want that.
way to go, ray, martinez, torrance.
i can walk.
well, maybe if christie
wants to help me, she could.
- thanks, li'i one.
- any time, lewis.
figgy!
- figgy!
- whoa, sorry. sorry!
- ow!
- let me see, let me see!
- ah... ooh!
that's a .50 caliber!
that's a painful .50 caliber.
- oh, man!
- look at that. yeah.
- what about you?
- i'm fine. see?
oh, please, come on. that's a bb gun.
let's finish our report and get outta here.
okay.
i'll say it.
i completely underestimated you, sheriff.
it's okay.
you're a hell of a lawman.
and you don't give up too easy.
you're right. this is my home.
impressive.
impressive.
sheriff.
keep it.
you earned it.
thanks, ray.
jerry would want you to have it.
thanks.
ray? ray!
what in god's name happened to my car?
well, next time don't
park it in the fire zone.
schmuck.
come on.
