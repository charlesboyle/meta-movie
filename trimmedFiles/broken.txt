-well, you never know, jed.
-mike.
-by nature is what?
-well, it's adversarial.

-(jed, sarcasticaiiy) aw.
-lt's 'cause you're in love with him.
-no, l'm not!
(mike) guys, guys.
ln my experience, the person
who brings up the subject of love
is more often than not
the person who is in love.
-really?
-shut up.
-you're blushing, jed.
-(laughing)
what about you two? are you in love?
mike and l? of course.

oh, yes, but he says, uh,
he can't act in any way
without rick's permission.
-which he won't give.
-this is what l'm saying.
he won't come out
of his bedroom, archie.
(mr buckiey) janet sits outside
his door aii day
trying to taik to him, and nothing.
(sighs) l'm sorry to drop in on you
like this, out of the blue,
but l just. . .
you know, l just thought. . .
l thought, "well, archie, he's a. . .
a solicitor and. . ."
so you want. . .
you want to take this matter further?
you want to make this a legal matter?
bloody legal action?
no, no, no. forget it. uh. . .
l don't want anything more
to do with the bastard.
-oswald?
-yes.
why not?
because l'm scared of him.
l'm just really bloody scared of him.
(mrs buckiey) and you went
under the water.
five years old.
and your father ran so fast
across those stones to get you.
and he got you.
he saved you.
-and then. . .
-(doorbell chiming)
hello, mrs buckley. ls rick in?
why?
don't know.
just thought he might like
to hang out or something.
he's ill, love. he can't come out.
oh. . .
-okay, well. . .
-goodbye now, love.
bye.
(door closes)
(keys jangling)
(footsteps approaching)
(mrs buckley) and anyway. . .
then we bought you
that matchbox tank.
do you remember?
for being so brave.
and you tried to give it
to your dad
because he'd cut his feet up
running over those stones.
so kind, you were, so. . .
l mean,
what five-year-old in the world. . .
would have done that, huh?
um. . .
(mumbling) stupid.
-hello, archie.
-bob.
what can l do for you?
l was wondering
if we could have a little chat.
-chat?
-yeah.
yeah, absolutely.
okay, well, um. . .
l know things have been. . .tough for you
since barbara passed away, you know?
for you and for the girls, you know?
and what with. . .
everything that's
been happening lately. . .
l just. . . l wanted you to know that,
you know, if ever you wanted to talk. . .
-talk?
-yeah.
fuck off, archie, will you?
all right. um. . .
well, what l wanted
to ask you was, uh. . .
if you could ask your girls
to give the buckleys a break.
they've been having
a tough time of it lately.
-have they?
-yeah.
that's really awful. (sniffs)
when was the last time
you cried, archie?
-cried?
-yeah.
-l don't know. why?
-'cause the next time you will
is the next time that you criticise
my girls. . . no, hang on.
. . . in any fucking way
whatsoever, all right?
they're out of bounds.
and if buckley can't take
a little friendly fucking ribbing,
then he's more of a pathetic prick
than l thought he was.
now, l'm having my dinner, mate,
so if you don't mind fucking off.
thanks.
(jed) you know what'd make it better?
a blu-ray player.
yeah, well,
you can't have everything, jed.
no, l'm just saying.
l got you that ashtray, didn't l?
that's what l'm saying, skunk.
lt's brilliant.

-and they'll just start. . .
(sighs) you need to know
about this stuff, skunk.
the better prepared you are,
the better you'll do.
so, what they do
is they grab your hair from behind
and they just start snipping away
with a pair of scissors.
-so you pick your moment.
-yeah.
and you let them know
the arrangement.
yeah. . . what?
-the deal.

(laughing)
-lt's funnier later on.

(kasia) what about rachel?
what about her?
(kasia) lf she walked in right now,

of her walking out again
whenever she felt like it?

who she was.
poor archie.
poor kasia.

dumpy little turd.
(vikram) does he die?
(mike)
l can't tell you if he dies or not
because that's why we read,
to find out, okay?
but let's just all agree
there is a chance
that he may die, all right?
-(vikram) l don't want him to.
-all right.
(clears throat) now, why do we think
he goes on? kevin?
well, his life was rubbish, weren't it?
and boring.
whereas through the doors
there could be wicked shit.
-like dragons.
-like dragons and shit.
-trolls.
-yeah, like teachers.
(overlapping chatter)
(mike) everyone, just wait, wait.
that, what kevin said,
is the definition of courage. right?
being afraid. . .
but doing it anyway.
(vikram) l still would not go.
(boy) 'course you wouldn't go.
(vikram) l wouldn't want to die.
-he doesn't die, vikram.

when you're in the middle of something,
how things can be
so, uh, confusing, you know?
-unclear.
-what are you talking about?
no. whereas, you know,
what l'm saying is,
whereas with a bit of time
and a bit of distance and perspective,
things kind of. . .
look, whatever you want. . .
sorry?
a house, a baby,
whatever you want, l'll give you.
-that's very kind of you, mike.
-that's what l'm saying.
lt took me, l don't know,
stepping away. . .
(kasia) to get a perspective.
yes, and to realise
that the things that you want, kasia,
the things that you want are,
are the things that l want.

uh. . . mr kiernan's solicitor's here.
-so this is alleged?
-(dc carson) yes.
you haven't arrested my client?
(dc carson) for the moment,
he's helping us with our inquiries.
-get your jacket on.
-wait a minute.
(archie) no. she's a liar.
(dc jenks) what?
(archie)
she's done this type of thing before.
another man,
another accusation, essentially of rape.
another lie.
look it up, detective.
so you have a decision to make.
either you release my client or. . .
you arrest him.
and then we'll take this matter further
as her story falls apart.
(mike) thank you.
you can thank kasia.
she's the one that asked me to. . .
(clears throat) right.
-. . .come in for you.
-yeah. how are you two doing?
well, l don't really
want to talk about that.
-oh. don't you?
-no.
(laughs) why is that, archie?
ls that because what you have
is so fucking special
it can't be articulated, huh?
no, it's because
it's none of your business.
fuck you.
you know what? fuck you.
the last thing l need
beyond losing the woman that l love
is to be obliged to the man
who fucking stole her.
-well, l didn't steal her. . .
-yeah, well, you fuck. . .
and there's no obligation.
oh, fuck off, archie!
man, you couldn't be
more fucking patronising if you tried.
(skunk) then what?
(archie) l don't know, love.
they'll probably give him
some kind of dna test.
-right.
-right.
-you know what that is, do you?
-yes.
-no.
-lt's a test
-that'll show he isn't the father.
-but he isn't the father!
-we know that, love.
-she's a liar.
everyone knows she's done it with. . .
lots of boys.
-lt doesn't matter, skunk.
-why not?
because they're boys.
mike is an adult. you understand?
a teacher. ln this kind of situation,
they have to be absolutely sure
of his innocence.
(doorbell ringing)
and until they are, they just can't
allow him to work with children.
-so he's not coming back?
-(archie) not at the moment, no.
sorry, love.
skunk, it's your boyfriend.
birmingham?
but l thought. . . l thought you and me
were gonna go to florida
-and see. . . see the lizards and stuff.
-yeah, l know, but. . .
that was when we were older.
why not now, though?
because my aunt says
l have to go to birmingham, skunk.
what am l gonna do without you?
-here.
-(sighs)
-will you take this?
-why should l?
to remember me by.
when do you go?

gonna get to see you again.

how long did you know, dillon? !
-skunk.
-you're only telling me now!
-why haven't you told me? !

(mrs buckley) oh, it's lopsided.

-l was trying to find the right moment.
-are you gonna marry her?
-l don't know.
-kasia, l know you're there!
-are you?
-l don't know, love.
because she'll leave us, dad,
the way she left mike.
like mum left us. like everyone does.
-no, l won't.
-yes, you will ! don't lie.
lt'll all go wrong, dad.
everything always goes wrong.

♫ biue is where i want to be
♫ when i'm down i'm in the sea
♫ looking up at monsters in the clouds
♫ red's the colour when you're dead
♫ lf you find me gone, l'm just in bed
♫ reading up on fairy tales instead
♫ now l know so many things
♫ got feet and l got wings
♫ to carry me back home
♫ to my house just made of bricks
♫ well that's just such a fix
♫ to ever hoid me down
♫ white is what i was to start
♫ broken by my open heart
♫ falling down and falling up again
♫ black is white the other way
♫ paradise is in the grey
♫ all my colours mixing up again
♫ now l know so many things
♫ got feet and l got wings
♫ to carry me back home
♫ to my house just made of bricks
♫ well, that's just such a fix
♫ to ever hoid me down
(scatting)
♫ now l know so many things
♫ got feet and l got wings
♫ to carry me back home
♫ to my house just made of bricks
♫ well, that's just such a fix
♫ to ever hoid me down ♫
