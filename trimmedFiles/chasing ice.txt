john coleman: the ice
caps, the poles, are not going
to melt, the oceans are not
going to flood the coast --
i promise you, 20 years from today,
i'll be the one that's laughing.
james balog: the worst
that would happen is
that i'd just get really wet
if i just stood in place.
svav jonatansson: no.
you fall, you try to run,
you bang your knee on a piece
of ice, and you bust your knee.
james balog: ah, i just--
i have to get this picture.
svav jonatansson: the first
time i worked with james,
it was obvious how he goes
about things, you know?
james balog: alright quickly!
cause this light won't last forever.
svav jonatansson: he pushes
it-- he's looking for something.
james balog: you do
have rope in the car?
svav jonatansson: yeah.
james balog: go back
and get whatever you have.
svav jonatansson: okay.
james balog: alright, i'm,
i'm almost certain to get wet, okay?
in fact, i think i'm so certain to get wet,
i'll take my boots off.
svav jonatansson: and
it was very interesting
because it was his first real encounter
at looking at ice in that way.
he really did fall in love with it.
james balog: there's
this limitless universe
of forms out there...
that is just, surreal, other worldly.
sculptural, architectural...
insanely, ridiculously beautiful.
and that's when i though,
okay, the story is in the ice.
somehow.
i was umm, about 25 or so, i guess.
and i was finishing my master's
degree in geomorphology.
and um, i loved the science,
but i wasn't interested in being a scientist.
the modern world of science
was all about statistics
and computer modeling and that just wasn't me.
i had no contacts in the photo world,
i had no knowledge of the photo world.
but, youthful brashness can take you a long way,
make things happen, so, that's how it worked.
i had this idea that the most powerful issue
of our time was the interaction
of humans and nature.
one of the subjects i started to
look at involved people hunting.
but they were bloody, gory,
horrific pictures, hard to look
at-- hard for me to
look at even today.
and so, when i had this idea
to look at endangered wildlife,
i realized that i needed to show these things
in a more seductive fashion.
i had to look at it in ways
that would engage
people-- pull them in.
louis psihoyos: he's
always taken the big view.
you know? he's not looking
at this little micro slice.
he's really looking at what humanity is doing
from a very large perspective.
his books-- they force you
to regard nature in a way
that you're not accustomed to looking at em.
he's forcing you to think.
he's forcing me to think.
and that's what i love about james' work.
kitty boone: you know,
ansel adams was the father
of all landscape photography
and he created a movement
around wilderness that only images could do.
and now you have james
with that same kind of eye.
but being able to do more with the technology.
dr. sylia earle:
it's not just the drive
to climb mountains and hang off cliffs.
he has the ability to capture
it in a way and communicate it.
observing it and knowing it
is one thing, but sharing it
and sharing it effectively can change the world.
james balog: i did a
couple years of research
on the climate change story,
trying to find what you could
photograph about climate change
that would make interesting photographs.
and i eventually realized that
the only thing that-- to me--
sounded right, was ice.
dennis dimick: he came
with us with a proposal
to do a profile of one glacier in iceland.
we essentially countered
to him, we said, well look,
why don't we just do a bigger story.
it was on the cover of the magazine.
most popular, most wellread
story in the last five years.
james balog: as i
was shooting that story,
i started to get the very strong sense
that this was a scouting mission
for something much bigger,
and much longer-term
that was about to unfold.
the solheim glacier, the
sunhouse glacier in translation,
is where i really first got it.
that glacier had been receding
several hundred feet a year;
which is a lot.
you normally have a little bit
of advance in the winter time,
a little bit of retreat in the summer time;
but when you see huge amounts of change,
that's outside of normal behavior.
there was a real sense of the
glacier just coming to an end;
and like this old, decrepit man, just, you know,
falling into the earth and dying.
it was very evocative, very emotional.
as a guy who's been mountaineering
for basically my whole adult
life, uh, someone whose trained
in the earth sciences, i never imagined
that you could see features
this big disappearing
in such a short period of time.
but when i did-- when i saw
that-- and i realized, my god,
there's a powerful piece
of history that's unfolding
in these pictures and i have
to go back to those same spots.
so, i set up a whole bunch of camera positions
around that glacier where i would just go back
and shoot a single frame.
you know, one in april, one in october,
and we would just see how the
glacier changed in six months.
james balog: (vo):
right there where svav is.
right there.
that's exactly where the ice was.
right there.
right? over.
jeff orlowski: uhh,
correct, this is where...
james balog: that glacier
had changed so much, that,
i'm not kidding, for like
three hours, we stood there,
looking at the prints of six months ago,
looking at the glacier going, we must be wrong,
we can't be in the right places.
they appear to be from over there.
james balog: and when i
saw those, the lights when off
for me, i realized, the
public doesn't wanna hear
about more statistical
studies, more computer models,
more projections-- what
they need is a believable,
understandable piece
of visual evidence--
something that grabs them in the gut.
so i created this project called
the extreme ice survey-- or eis.
the initial goal was to put
out twenty five cameras for three years.
and they would shoot every hour
as long as it was daylight.
we would download those cameras every so often
and turn those individual
frames into video clips
that would show you how
the landscape was changing.
i thought that basically,
you could just buy all this time
lapse equipment off the shelf,
slam it together and put it out there.
i was so naive about that.
uh, there was a custom
computer that needed to be built
and there were a thousand little
engineering details that needed
to be worked out and a lot of trial and error,
because people hadn't built this stuff before.
and it was clear to me, it
would have to be a team effort.
adam lewinter: i wasn't
that into photography,
but i talked him into me coming
up here and having a look.
cause i was curious and i really
wanted to do whatever i could
to get my foot in the door.
james balog: svav is the
field assistant in iceland.
you ready?
svav jonatansson:
as ready as i can be.
dr. jason box: these
are more attractive
because i think they're more pictureeqse,
and they're still big glaciers.
james balog: jason has a
deep, deep well of experience
about greenland's glaciers,
about greenland logistics,
about what the glaciers were doing.
tad's a glaciologist he's
really the grandfather,
the godfather the knowledge base
about those glaciers in alaska.
suzanne balog: the scope
and the scale of eis is bigger
than any other project since i've known him.
they would work all day, in our little,
what used to be our garage,
turned into a workshop--
until sometimes, 11, 12 o'clock at night.
jeff orlowski: james sent
me a gear list of things
that i had never heard-- i
mean ice axes and crampons--
all of this technical climbing gear
that i had never used before.
i remember thinking that i
never want to do ice climbing
or ice related stuff, it's
dangerous, i'm gonna die,
but of course, i still
went with james to iceland.
jeez...
james balog: what?
svav jonatansson: i'm
just saying jesus christ.
svav jonatansson: i'm
just emphasizing how bad the
weather is.
james balog: yeah,
i don't need it.
i get it.
jeff orlowski: the essence
of the camera systems is based
on putting really delicate electronics
in the harshest conditions on the planet.
adam lewinter: they have to
withstand hurricane force winds.
jeff orlowski: negative
adam lewinter: it's
not the nicest environment
for technology to be sitting out in.
james balog: whatever the
dangers of that boulder are,
that's a better spot than this is.
well we found a place to hide the camera;
that's the good news.
the bad news is we've got a
major engineering project to try
and get that thing anchored and supported.
this thing is loose.
look how soft this stuff is.
yeah it's gotta be this section right here.
uh... the other way around.
rock! this is fantastic.
look at this.
it's exactly what we wanted.
okay.. well, here we go.
the first eyeballs on
the glacier-- finally.
let's uh, see what a couple years brings to us.
jeff orlowski: we
installed five cameras
in total on that trip.
after that, we went on to greenland.
james balog: when glaciers
break these gigantic icebergs
off into the ocean it's
called calving c-a-l-v-i-n-g.
ever since glaciers have entered
the ocean, hundreds of thousands
of years ago, ice has always calved off.
but what we're seeing now is the
greenland ice sheet thinning out
and dumping out ever more
ice and water into the ocean.
okay good.
yep. right up here.
james balog (cont'd):
it's sort of like doing a portrait of people.
you know, uh, richard avendan
and irving penn spent their
entire careers doing portraits
of faces essential, and found endless variation
and endless beauty and endless
magic in those faces and for me,
that's the same thing as what's going on here.
you know you feel this
tension between this huge,
enduring power of these
glaciers and their fragility.
you know, they came from
a great, impassive place,
and they're just, they're crumbling
into these tiny little blocks
of ice going off into the ocean.
it's crazy.
jeff orlowski: my first trip
to greenland, we were setting
up one of the cameras at store glacier.
we got there, we saw this really,
bizarre looking peninsula.
just kind of perched out at the
front of this-- the calving face
of the glacier, where the glacier ends.
james balog: this thing is gonna
break off all summer long man.
look at this.
those peninsulas are, are
just a matter of days--
at most, a couple weeks.
jeff orlowski: it was huge.
it was five football fields
long-- 1,500 feet long.
and about 300 feet above
the surface of the water.
as we're setting up the cameras,
we also set up a video camera,
and had it pointed right
there, at that peninsula,
and we just had it rolling.
just in case.
jason box (vo): oh my god,
a giant crack just formed.
see that whole island, it's going away.
there it goes man.
jeff orlowski: we were there
for just a one hour period of time.
and, absurdly, somehow
fortunately captured an event
that seldom is caught on film.
james balog: there is this
really big stuff happening right
under our noses, happening right now.
but i feel like time is clicking, you know.
and we need to get these cameras out here.
james balog: okay.
onward.
svav jonatansson:
the logistics
of things are just like, crazy.
it reminds you how far he's
willing to take an idea.
james balog: heads up!
heads up!
tight, tight tight.
james balog: this
is tonight's dinner,
i just found out.
dr. jason box: eight.
seven. six, five.
james balog: ah!
this is the way to travel, my friend.
we ended up installing about
a dozen cameras in greenland,
five in iceland, five in
alaska and two in montana.
frankly, i can't believe we actually managed
to pull this off.
you know, about 20 years ago,
i was a skeptic about climate change.
i thought is was based on computer models,
i thought maybe there was a lot of hyperbole
that was turning this into an activist cause.
but most importantly, i didn't
think that humans were capable
of changing the basic physics and chemistry
of this entire huge planet.
it didn't seem probable,
it didn't seem possible.
and then i learned about the
record that's in the ice cores.
the history of ancient climate
that was embedded in those cores.
and the story that the glaciers were telling.
dr. tad pfeffer:
the greenland
and antarctic ice sheets
are these giant domes of ice
that preserve climate records,
very much like tree rings.
snow is added to the top, turns into ice,
and ice core scientist can drill
holes through the ice sheets
and pull out a core and
examine, not only the ice,
but also bubbles of ancient air
that are trapped in the ice.
by looking at the chemistry
of the ice, we can learn
about past temperature,
and by looking at the air,
we can actually measure
the carbon dioxide content.
one of the things that we
learn, is that past temperature
and carbon dioxide vary together.
they go up together, they go down together.
and over the last 800,000 years or so,
atmospheric carbon dioxide was never higher
that about 280 parts per million.
until we started adding carbon
dioxide to the atmosphere.
and now it's about 390 parts per million.
and that's about 40 percent higher than it was
when carbon dioxide was only
varying for natural reasons.
but now we're heading for 500
parts per million or more.
dr. synte peacock: that pace
is a 100 to 1000 times greater
than the pace at which things have changed
by themselves, naturally.
the amazing thing to me is that
we're already seeing impacts
because the change already
has been so small, right?
it's been .8 degrees c,
about 1.5 degrees
farenheit since 1850 or so.
and yet we've seen so much stuff...
crazy stuff going on already.
james balog: what counts
to me more than the notion
of the climate changing, is
that the air is changing.
the air that we live in,
the air that sustains us,
the basic physics and chemistry
of that air is changing.
this is about the stuff that you and i breath.
and that effects everything in the agriculture
and the water supply of all the
plants and animals around us.
dr. terry root: plants
and animals are already going extinct.
they're going extinct a 100 times faster now
than they did 1000 years ago.
and as the climate continues to
warm, we're going to loose more
and more, and more species because we're going
to have more suppresses happening.
we're going to have a mass extinction event
that could happen within
the next 200 to 300 years.
mass extinction event means that we loose half,
or maybe three quarters of the number of species
that we have on the planet.
are we going to be loosing the
plants that clean our water?
the plants that clean our air?
if there's no pollinators
out there to pollinate,
then we're going to have to do it by hand.
and they're already doing that
in china-- having to go out
and pollinate their crops by hand.
dr. thomas swetnam: in the
last 20 years, we have lost,
close to 20 percent of the forest area
in arizona-new mexico.
and that's a high mortality
in those forest areas.
we have seen an increasing in
the length of the fire season
by more than two
months; larger fires
in the western united
states in the last 20 years;
and we've seen hotter fires
- more extreme fires burning.
it's not just by chance that
i'm seeing many rare events
happening all in sequence, you know.
there's a reason for that.
we're seeing extraordinary
changes in our environment.
dr. peter hoeppe: munich
re is the world's largest
re-insurance company and
our business model is
to provide insurance for
the insurance companies.
as munich re is a major
reinsurer for natural perils,
natural catastrophes; we need
to know the risks as best as we can.
we have discovered some trends in the number
and in the losses natural perils have caused.
and, interestingly, for
the weather related events,
our activities-- primarily
greenhouse gas emissions--
are contributing to more
intense and more events.
it cannot be acclaimed by just better reporting,
it has to be explained by changes
in the atmospheric conditions.
dr. gerald meehl: imagine
a base ball player on steroids
who steps up to the plate and hits a home run.
can you attribute that home
run to his taking steroids?
well steroids occur naturally
in very small amounts
in your system, but by adding just a little bit
of those steroids, you can
change your background physical
state and increase your
chances for enhanced performance
and that's exactly what
happens in the climate system.
greenhouse gases occur in very
small amounts but by increasing
that just a little bit, you
change the background state
of the system and make it much more susceptible
to increased extremes.
james balog: if you had
an abcess in your tooth,
would you keep going to dentist after dentist
until you found a dentist that said,
ahhh, don't worry about it.
leave that rotten tooth in.
or would you pull it out because more
of the other dentists told
you you had a problem?
that's sort of what we're
doing with climate change.
we'll be arguing about this for centuries.
we're still arguing about a
minor thing called evolution,
a minor thing about whether man
actually walked on the moon.
we don't have time.
helicopter pilot: we
have low oil pressure
in engine number two.
so i've shut down engine number two.
we cannot hover with one engine.
james balog: you look out
that window at that sea water
with icebergs floating around in
there and you realize if we go
in that, we'll have five
minutes of physical function
and in 10 minutes we're dead.
dr. jason box: the fire
brigade will be on standby
in case we need their help.
radio chatter
suzanne balog: he needs
to do his adventures.
that's what makes him who he is.
that's who the man is, that's who i married.
do i wish sometimes that it was closer
and he would come home at five o'clock?
as a wife, yes.
as a human being, it needs to continue, so.
simone balog: he's on
this never ending quest
for something.
he's just going and hoping that something
that he's doing is taking
him in the right direction
and i think that eis is it.
he's looking to make a global, worldwide impact.
i've never seen him so passionate
about a project before.
svav jonatansson:
alright, this way.
it's my job to go out there every couple
of months to visit the cameras.
to go over is everything is okay.
there was always a possibility
that this would happen.
this just-- this whole
piece must have cracked off
in one part; flew off
into whoever knows where.
the rock obviously did not read our warning.
james balog: it's
only shot eight pictures
in the past 24 hours which is somewhat weird.
in fact it's very weird.
dr. jason box: it--
it could still shoot.
james balog: come on, please.
please work.
it's dead.
it has to be dead.
jason box: okay, so...
james balog: everything we're
trying is getting thwarted.
adam lewinter: again.
zebras again.
james balog: ohhhhh.
jeff orlowski:
we've had numerous,
numerous timer failures.
we've had cameras buried
under 15 or 20 feet of snow.
james balog: ewwww.
oh my.
jeff orlowski: we've had
plexiglas windows sand blasted.
we've had batteries explode
inside the camera boxes.
adam lewinter: i think
it's a bird just kind
of pecking away at it.
adam lewinter: this is
what a fox does to your cables
when you're not looking.
adam lewinter: he had
spent a lot of many-- grants,
personal money, getting to
alaska, getting to greenland
and when you go out there, you want it to work,
and when something doesn't work,
you feel so far from anything
and anyone that can help you.
james balog: i think it's
in that voltage regulator.
all of that obsession means absolutely nothing
if a little electronic
piece that big doesn't work.
if i don't have pictures, i don't have anything.
you know, everything is a failure.
no, it's dead, it's not working.
period, flat out, just dead.
it's dead.
god, after all this!
after all this, it just
- it makes me insane!
it makes me fucking insane!
it's so disappointing.
simone balog: it's hard to
see somebody that you love chase
after something that...
might not ever happen.
james balog: see that
white dot down there...
there's a white dot on the...
something's happening inside the timer.
after months of trouble shooting,
we realized that the core problem was
in the voltage regulator and
in this little computer timer--
this custom made computer that
told the cameras when to fire.
adam lewinter: we
worked with these guys
at national geographic, and we sat down
and re-designed the controllers.
james balog: we switched
to an entirely different kind
of a circuit that used less
power and is a lot more reliable
because it has a simpler
electronic circuitry inside it.
adam lewinter: that
was the turning point
for the whole system.
james balog: we had to
replace all the old timers.
and had to wait for a whole
season to check on them again
and make sure they were working.
adam lewinter: we
gotta be getting close.
james balog: we are.
we'll be able to see it from up here.
adam lewinter: yeah.
james balog: okay.
alright. this is
the big one; okay.
here it goes.
playback.
james balog: march.
it's been working all winter!
ahhh man. hello!
i can't believe that worked.
do you know how cold it's
been out here, for how long?
adam lewinter: i'm
unbelievably surprised.
adam lewinter (cont'd):
we have over 2,300 frames.
james balog: since june?
let me see.
adam lewinter: and
everything's working.
james balog: it's been
shooting the entire time...
fantastic.
here's the memory of the
camera and this is-- actually,
that's an interesting thought.
this is the memory of the landscape.
that landscape is gone.
it may never be seen again in
the history of civilization
and it's stored right here.
in 1984, the glacier was
down there, 11 miles away.
and today, it's back here.
it receded 11 miles.
the glacier's retreating,
but it's also thinning at the same time.
it's like the air being let out of a balloon.
you can see what's
called the trim line--
it's the high water mark of the glacier in 1984.
that vertical change is the height
of the empire state building.
you know, we're really in the
midst of geologic scale change.
you know our brains are programed to think
that geology is something
that happened a long time ago
or it will happen a long time in the future.
and we don't think that can
happen during these little years
that we each live on this planet.
but the reality is that it does.
that things can happen very, very very quickly.
we're living through one of those moments
of epochal geologic change right now.
and we humans are causing it.
james balog: up and down
the edges of the ice sheet,
there's this zone called the melt zone.
this is where the sheet is
melting and that stored water
from the ice sheet is running out to sea.
i have to wrap my knees
for the day's festivities.
this knee has had two surgeries on it already
and it really could use a third.
it's like the surface of the moon.
look at those holes.
oh my gosh, look at this stuff!
i had no idea it was so thick in here.
this stuff, this cryoconite,
it's made from a combination
of natural dust that blows in from the deserts
of central asia, mixed with
little flakes of carbon,
fine particles of soot that come
from wildfires, diesel exhaust
and coal-fired power plants.
and on top of it, there's algae
that grows out here and all
of that stuff accumulates in these little holes,
and because it's black, it
absorbs the sun's heat more
than the surrounding ice does.
and all over the surface of the ice sheet,
there's literally billions
of these little cryoconite holes melting away
and filling up with water.
and when you look down at those holes,
what you can actually see
is these little bubbles
of ancient air being released
as the ice sheet melts.
the part of greenland that's melting,
is out on the edges of the ice sheet.
and that area is growing, and it's moving higher
up onto the ice sheet.
as the climate changes in
that part of the world.
you see, all this water, melting
down through these swiss cheese
holes, you see it melting
down through the channels,
from little channels into big channels.
and eventually, everything drops vertically,
down through these big moulin caverns.
goes down to the bottom of the ice sheet
and out into the ocean.
dr. tad pfeffer: ordinarily,
if you make climate a little warmer,
the glacier shrinks a little bit.
if you make the climate a little colder,
the glacier grows a little bit.
and those two things kind
of work to maintain balance.
but if it gets too warm,
and the ice gets too thin,
it doesn't just respond just a
little bit, the volume drops.
you cross that tipping point,
climate no longer matters.
it's irreversible-- it's
just gonna keep going.
james balog: the sea
level rise that will happen
in my daughter's lifetimes,
will be somewhere between a foot
in a half and a half and three feet.
minimum. that doesn't sound
like a lot if you live
in the rocky mountains, but if
you live down in chesapeake bay,
along the gulf coast of the united states,
in the ganges flood plane
- that matters a lot.
it matters in china, it matters in indonesia.
a minimum of 150 million
people will be displaced--
that's like approximately half
the size of the united states.
and all of those people are
going to be flushed out and have
to move somewhere else.
it also intensifies the impact
of hurricanes and typhoons.
it means that there's a lot
more high water along the coast
lines, so when these big storms come,
it pushes that much more water
that much further inland.
that's where our story
of greenland climate change is expressed,
it's in that melt water,
rushing out to the ocean.
that's what we're photographing;
that's what i've been
up there trying to document.
adam lewinter: you know, i've
seen this thing from your photos
and sat pictures, but to
be here, it's incredible.
it's all becoming a little more real.
while we're heading over, why don't i walk over
and give you some scale?
james balog: sure.
just be careful, don't get too
close to the edge, alright?
stay up where it's flat.
this is really something.
adam lewinter:
this is terrifying.
: this isn't a 10 foot
little hole in the ground,
it's 100 feet deep into an abyss.
if you don't have that,
that little dot of a person
for scale, then it's lost.
james balog: that
is fabulous.
this is a reasonable route right here.
look at that.
adam lewinter: oh yeah.
james balog: that's
like a gift.
adam lewinter: this
is the danger spot.
james balog: yeah.
adam lewinter: for sure.
james balog: well,
and the other danger is
that the whole thing suddenly implodes
and the entire thing collapses,
but i don't think that's very likely.
adam lewinter: this moulin is
one of thousands of moulins all
over the melt zone in greenland and everyday,
the ice is cooking down,
and water is pouring into the ice sheet.
it's enormous, you can't wrap your head
around how much water is coming off this place.
adam lewinter
(cont'd): you got it.
jeff orlowski: adam,
have you ever done something
like this before?
adam lewinter: no.
not at all.
adam lewinter: it's
all calculated risks.
it's not like we're just going out there
and playing russian roulette.
james balog: piece o'cake.
ohhh, there's all sorts of curios crinkling
and crunching effects in my knee.
just not what the doctor ordered.
alright. look down!
adam lewinter: look down?
james balog: look!
down!
adam lewinter: it's
just bottomless...
oh my god.
i do not want to go any lower than this.
james balog: i'm going
out here on this broken fin.
okay? and i don't, i
assume it won't collapse.
james balog (cont'd): okay.
all done!
adam lewinter: oh thank god!
james balog: fantastic!
there were audible chunks
of gravel like substances
that i could feel rolling around in there.
the bionic man.
i was covering up the soreness
with anti-inflammatories
and pain killers so that i
could function in the field
and i would think, ah, that's
pretty good-- not so bad.
not realizing that the drugs
were masking the symptoms way
more than i had realized.
james balog (cont'd):
bye babe.
i love you.
suzanne balog:
i love you too.
female newscaster: more
and more people are becoming
increasingly skeptical
about the existence of climate change.
hannity: these so called
climate scientists are
hoodwinking the entire world community.
brian sussman: there is
no consensus, this is a myth.
senator inhofe: the
notion that man made gas,
this anthropogenic gas, this c02
cause global warming is probably
the greatest hoax ever perpetrated
on the american people.
rush limbaugh (vo):
all of this garbage science has
been a total fraud and a fake!
suzanne balog: jim was
told after his surgery
that hiking is not a form of exercise
that they want him to pursue anymore.
i'm not sure that's sunken in quite yet.
james balog: i think,
when we started out,
the glacier was approximately right here.
it might of been there, it might of been here;
but it's in this zone somewhere.
look. look at this.
in '05, you couldn't even look
into the canyon back there,
look, it was all filled up to that point.
and look how, look how low it is now.
james balog: beautiful.
and that's 2007--
that isn't even 2005.
in 2007, just two years
ago, you couldn't see any
of that mountain ridge over there.
the thing has deflated tremendously, i mean,
i don't know what the number
of feet is, but, it's a lot.
if i hadn't seen it in the pictures,
i wouldn't believe it at all.
james balog: when i saw that
glacier dying, it was like, wow.
you know we, uh...
if a glacier that's been here for 30,000 years,
or 100,000 years is literally
dying in front of my eyes,
you're very aware of the fact that...
you know, sometime you um...
sometime you go out over the
horizon and you don't come back.
jeff orlowski: james is now
doing exactly what his doctors
said he shouldn't be doing.
adam lewinter: lower.
james balog: oh, man.
adam lewinter:
a little more...
okay...
yes...there you go.
james balog: it
feels worse this morning
than it has any day since the surgery.
it felt better the three days after the surgery
than it feels right now.
i think that the best that
can be said about this is,
ah i'm a safety liability.
adam lewinter: well, you can
maybe limp your way up, but...
you can't go down that.
svav jonatansson: unless
you're in a wheelchair.
adam lewinter: i mean,
we need to go up there--
check on the camera, and all of that, but...
but you don't necessarily need to do it.
i mean, that's more of a climb
than we did in the past two days.
james balog: i have a hard
time letting ideas go, you know?
svar jonatansson: well
here's another thing.
adam lewinter: that's
why your knee's like this.
james balog: okay.
i'm inclined to think that you
guys should at least go and look
at one of the cameras
- get it downloaded,
get the computer changed today.
okay?
adam lewinter: yep.
james balog: enough
adam lewinter: see the route?
adam lewinter (cont'd): okay.
hold on. see if you
can get in there.
that's it!
let's get out of here.
adam lewinter (cont'd):
every once in a while,
i get this thing in the back of my head saying,
what were you thinking?
maybe that office job wasn't so bad.
but...
svav jonatansson: the
sandwiches are better here.
adam lewinter: the
- after the sandwich,
i'm totally happy to be here.
this project is...
now we're two years in.
we have like, hundreds of thousands of images.
svav jonatansson:
it feels like, yeah,
he goes to that point where he can't anymore
and sometimes you even feel
he's going even further.
yeah and he speaks about it, he says, well,
so i'll just do a fourth knee surgery, you know?
like, however many it takes to keep him going.
like most people say, i'm
going to get knee surgery
to fix me, kind of, you know?
it's to make it better.
but for him, it's to make
it better so he can keep
on pushing it, destroying it, basically,
and then maybe he'll just have to do it again.
james balog: okay svav, you
ready for another exposure?
do it exactly as you just did it, okay?
you ready?
svav jonatansson: so as
quick as i can, i, i cover it.
james balog: that's right.
james balog (cont'd): way
back, early in my career,
i discovered that there was
really something special
about photographing at
night, that places your mind
on the surface of a planet.
you're no longer just a human being walking
around in the regular world.
you are a human animal,
striding around on the surface
of the planet that's out in
the middle of the galaxy.
we as a culture--
we're forgetting
that we are actually natural organisms
and that we have this very, very deep connection
and contact with, and contact with nature.
you can't divorce civilization from nature.
we totally depend on it.
adam lewinter:
shortly after that,
he sent us on this month long, massive trip,
to a place that's really hard to get to,
to get a shot that's is just--
it was such a shot in the dark.
the idea sprung from this
one glacier called store.
that event was so spectacular, we decided,
okay we got to go back,
and go to the big glacier,
ilulissat glacier and sit.
and wait. we're going
to try to catch some...
some big calving events.
you know, kilometer wide pieces of ice coming
of this massive, massive, glacier.
jeff orlowski: the ilulissat
glacier in greenland is kind
of-- like the mother
of all glaciers.
it is the most productive glacier
in the norther hemisphere.
it's rumored that this is the
glacier that put out the iceberg
that sank the titanic.
it flows at 130 feet every day.
this is a really, really huge fjord of ice,
and it's about five miles wide.
adam lewinter:
that is massive.
jeff orlowski:
i totally lost him.
you see him still?
adam lewinter: he's going--
he's, he's about to turn on go
in front of the peninsula
that we think's going to go.
jeff orlowski: oh, i see him.
adam lewinter: he's
at the base of it.
jeff orlowski: what's up?
adam lewinter:
my boots are frozen.
and i'm really tired.
and nothing happens.
for days and days and days.
we called it glacier watching.
jeff orlowski: because
literally, it was just,
me and adam, for three weeks, watching ice.
james balog: photography
for me has been--
as much as anything-- about
a raising of awareness.
through that camera, you
know, we become vehicles
to raise awareness outside my own experience.
and in this case, we're the messengers.
presentor: he is a visionary,
and his works are like sacred objects.
i present james balog.
james balog: thank
you so much.
can we dim the house lights a little bit more?
that's it, better.
okay. what i'm here
to do tonight is bring
to you tangible, visual
evidence of the immediacy
of climate change itself.
glaciers matter because they're the canary
in the global coal mine.
it's the place where you can
see climate change happening.
and without further adieu,
let me tell you what we've
been seeing out there.
this is a glacier called the solheim glacier,
we're looking down on it.
now we turn on our time lapse.
you can see the terminus retreating,
you can see this river being formed,
you can see it deflating.
you go back a couple years, in time...
that's where it started.
that's where it ended a few months ago.
now down onto the side of the glacier,
looking across the terminus.
this is what we see.
look at this.
you'll see deflation happening here
as heat takes away the surface
of the glacier, the surface drops.
at the same time, a stream is undercutting it
from a glacier that's melting faster up valley,
washing this thing away.
the vast majority of glaciers
in the world are retreating.
glacier national park
montana will need a new name.
we'll be calling it glacier-less
national park by the middle
of the century because all
the glaciers will be gone.
there's such a strange, bizarre fascination
in seeing these things you don't normally get
to see-- - come alive.
we're up at the columbia glacier
in alaska, this is a view
of what's called a calving face.
this is what one of our cameras saw
over a course of a few months.
the action at columbia is in part,
due to local glacier dynamics
and in part due to climate change.
here's another time-laps
shot of columbia.
and everybody says well don't
they advance in the wintertime?
no, it was retreating through the winter
because it's an unhealthy glacier.
we realized it was retreating
so far we had to turn the camera
up stream to follow the retreat.
then, we had to pivot it again.
and then, when we went back
this past august, it was so far
out of frame we had to turn
the camera one more time
so that we could still see the glacier.
so that's where we started three
years ago way out on the left,
that's where we were a few
months ago last time we were
into columbia.
adam lewinter:
we're going to have
to collapse it ---
put rocks over it.
it's ripping too.
we got to collapse it now.
female reporter (vo): james
balog is documenting the melting
of glaciers around the world.
the most visible manifestations
of climate change on the planet.
and he's making it possible
for scientists to watch too.
cnn female reporter
(vo): james balog is founder
and director of the extreme
ice survey he's joining us now
from denver, james, thanks for being with us.
james balog: my
pleasure, thank you.
brian williams we'll also have
more on our special report
on a man who lets his pictures do the talking
james balog: as a
photographer, it's exciting
to see this stuff, but as
a citizen of the world,
you go, this is horrible.
male reporter (vo): and
consider who nasa is sending
as a delegate to the climate
change summit in copenhagen.
jim balog, a photographer with
the group extreme ice survey.
james balog: prior to '06--
this glacier had retreated 10, 11 miles.
and, now we've added just in the past few years,
another two and a half miles.
dr. martin sharp: one of
the things you often hear
in the debate about glacier change is
that there are glaciers around the world
which are also getting bigger
and advancing, so, how can that be?
how can that be a response
to a global warming signal?
what we've done recently on the
yukon territory in canada ---
where we looked at the change in
glacier area from 1958 to 2008.
and what we found was, of the
in 1958, four got bigger.
over 300 disappeared completely, and almost all
of the rest got smaller.
yes, there is a component of natural variability
in the climate change we
observe, but, it's not enough
to explain the full signal.
so there has to be a
greenhouse gas element to it.
james balog: up to the
ilulissat glacier calving face.
a little helicopter is shown for scale.
the atlantic ocean is on
the left side of the frame,
covered with icebergs so thick,
that you could walk across the ocean...
adam lewinter: i'm
on the phone with jim,
on one of our regular check-ins,
jim, just, nothing's happening.
adam lewinter
(cont'd): hey jim!
uh... it's going well.
we had some serious bouts of wind.
but other than that, things
are fairly well set up here.
we've got some continuous time lapse going.
jeff orlowski: it's
starting adam, i think.
adam it's starting.
adam lewinter:
oh wait, jim, jim...
the big piece is starting to calve.
let me call you back.
jeff orlowski: call him back.
adam lewinter: okay.
bye.
james balog: is
it still going?
jeff orlowski: yeah.
in that v-section right there.
holy shit, look at that big berg rolling.
all four are running, right?
adam lewinter: yeah...
look at that!
do you see how...
look at the whole thing!
adam lewinter (cont'd):
the calving face was 300
sometimes 400 feet tall.
pieces of ice were shooting
out of the ocean 600 feet and then falling.
the only way you can try to put it into scale
with human reference is
if you imagine manhattan.
all the sudden, all those
buildings just start to rumble
and quake and peel off and just fall over,
fall over and roll around.
this whole massive city, just breaking apart
in front of your eyes.
we're just observers.
these two little dots on
the side of the mountain
and we watched and recorded the largest,
witnessed calving event ever caught on tape.
james balog: so how
big was this calving event
that we just looked at?
we'll resort to some illustrations again
to give you a sense of scale.
it's as if the entire lower
tip of manhattan broke off,
except that, the thickness--
the height of it-- is equivalent
to buildings that are two and a half
or three times higher than they are.
that's a magical, miraculous,
horrible, scary thing.
i don't know that anybody's
really seen the miracle
and horror of that.
it took a hundred years for it
to retreat eight miles
- from 1900 to 2000.
from 2000 to 2010, it retreated nine miles.
so in 10 years, it retreated more
than it had in the previous 100.
it's real.
the changes are happening;
they're very visible,
they're photographable, they're measurable.
there's no significant
scientific dispute about that.
and the great irony and tragedy
of our time is that a lot
of the general public thinks
that science is still arguing about that.
science is not arguing about that.
james woolsey: one of
the really troubling things
about climate change is that almost all
of the world's prestigious
climatologist are much more
frightened about all this than the public is.
dennis dimick: people have
a hard time understanding
when we talk about climate change.
what for me is so powerful
and actually unprecedented
in the work that he is doing,
is visualizing the change
that allows us to actually see
what was and what is become.
richard ward: i actually
saw his work last spring
and that kind of changed my
life in the sense that i had
to quit what i was doing,
which was working for shell,
and get involved in this debate
in a much more profound way.
louis psihoyos: the
extreme ice survey will go
down in history as this is the evidence
that we knew what was going on.
you can't deny it!
james balog: we don't have
a problem with economics,
technology and public policy.
we have a problem with perception.
because not enough people really get it yet.
i believe we really have
an opportunity right now.
we are nearly on the edge of a crisis,
but we still have an opportunity
to face the greatest challenge
of our generation, and in fact, of our century.
thank you.
when my daughters, simone and
emily, look at me 25 or 30 years
from now and say, what were
you doing when, when...
global warming was happening
and you guys knew what was coming down the road.
i want to be able to say, guys,
i was doing everything i knew how to do.
