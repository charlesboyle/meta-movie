from the ashes of the ruin,
the communities were built.
protected by the boundary.
all memories of
the past were erased.
after the ruin, we started over.
creating a new society.
one of true a quality.
rules were the building
blocks of that qualities.
we learned them as a new children.
rules like:
"use precise language",
"wear your assigned clothing",
- "take your morning medication."
- injected.
"obey the curfew."
"never lie."
the giver
my name is jonas. i don't have
a last name, none of us did.
that day, the day
before graduation,
i admitted, i was scared.
tomorrow we'd be assigned our jobs.
our purpose.
seemed everyone knew their already.
not me. i was last.
i always felt that i saw things...
differently.
saw things other people didn't.
i never said anything. i
didn't wanna be different.
who would?
jonas!
i apologize, we're late, like god actually
to come say goodbye the teacher.
i accept your apology.
asher and fiona, we've been
friends our whole life.
asher was the boy who
made everyone laugh.
fiona... well.
she was the girl who
made everybody smile.
if we're listening:
please, please!
do not make me vise jeff
where matt has been. please.
we lived in a world where
differences were not allowed.
there was no "popular", no "fame",
no "looser" and no "winners".
our elders eliminated all of that, so
that there is no conflict between us.
fear, pain, envy, hate...
there were words, so much as sounds.
their echoes were gone to
the other side of history.
i wonder if i should
apologize for what i did.
i let you decide.
i'm going to miss volunteering here.
oh no! if ever there is a person
boring to work in a nurturing center.
i could be surprise, right?
jonas, if you had to guess, of all
positions the elders picked for me...
nurturing center.
welcome to the nurturing center.
- i got this. i got this. think heaven.
- come on. come on. - think heaven.
we win! or you
might be the champion!
- which one is the heavier?
- mine.
asher!
- i rather think fiona put her
finger on the scale! - i did not!
oh, this little guy didn't
qualify for tomorrow's ceremony.
it's just not strong enough to
be assigned to a family here.
he looks so unhappy...
it's okay, jonas,
you can open it.
oh. hey! it's jonas.
here let me.
there you go, there you go...
- some people laugh at it.
- laugh is not fair!
be strong, gabriel!
dad, you looked at his name?
is not it against the rules?
yeah, it is...
i just thought having a
name would help him grow.
i whispered to him so no one can hear.
sometimes i say "gabe".
it's usually anxious,
i thought that if i hear...
- are you okay?
- hmm...
yeah, i'm fine.
so the old man turns to elder and says,
"do you know who i am?"
and the elder says,
"sir, i know you're old,
but that is not
the excuse for being prideful."
then the old man says, "no,
really, i am asking: who am i"?
i don't get it...
"who am i".
like he forgot who he was.
okay, but what if the joke it's
better than the old man said...
so: one... two...
three!
- aren't we graduates now?
- we do it every time, come on!
one, two, three...!
there you go...
so... i guess this is it.
last night of our childhood.
i guess everything is
gonna be different.
no, tomorrow, the only thing
that changes is what we do.
does not change what we are.
- good question. who are we?
- friends.
- friends forever.
- yes.
even when you both
designed be birth mothers.
i guess, we'll find out tomorrow, right?
citizens are reminded that the evening
creation will ending in 13 minutes.
thank you.
well did need to be rehabilitated.
i know he was lily's teacher,
but what was i supposed to do?
i feel...
disappointment.
- what was elder's decision?
- released to elsewhere.
can i released elsewhere, mother?
even just for one day...?
no you are to young, lily-billy.
jonas... your turn for feelings.
well, i guess some sort of...
terrified.
precision of language.
i mean anxious.
when you are about to graduate
you, did you ever feel...
that there was no
position meant for you?
they have been watching you
since you were even a child.
the elders are never wrong.
you will find your place.
welcome, citizens, to the
annual ceremony of advancement.
please, standby for a transmission.
- good morning, community.
- good morning, chief elder...
i apologize for my remote attendance.
we accept your apology.
i can't be at every
ceremony - in person.
but here's the secret: you
are my favorite community.
however, because we do not lie, i readly
admit i said that to every community.
beginnings...
from disorder and chaos, from
great suffering, great pain...
from confusion, and envy and hatred...
came a solution: communities.
beautiful places,
where disorder became harmony.
thank you. let me get through it.
oh, fine...
it begins the ceremony.
ceremony of the release to elsewhere.
honoring elderly citizens
who have devoted their work
to the beauty and harmony
of our beloved community.
and now ready for a joys
retirement elsewhere.

the symbol of their developing
independence and responsibility.
celebrating the graduates,
who today will be assigned
positions in our community.

jonas has not been assigned a
position, jonas has been selected.
we are not hasty this time, and we
could not afford another failure.
jonas posses all four attributes.
intelligence, integrity,
courage and one i name, but...
i can not describe: the
capacity to see beyond.
but i must warn you: your
training involves pain.
pain far beyond anything we known.
are you strong enough?
do we think jonas is brave enough?
jonas, you have been selected as
our next receiver of memories.
thank you for your childhood.
jonas...
jonas, jonas...
- help me up, please. - okay.
this leg, yup. that one. you got it.
- sit back, sit back...
- is jonas now more powerful than you?
what is the chief elder mean,
when she said:
"we can not afford
another failure"?
- well, ten years ago, the receiver...
- we can not speak of it.
you've been greatly honored.
- you got it. go, go!
- i can do it.
we should probably catch lily.
- good! good, lily!
- i can ride!
receiver of memory. five rules.
one: report directly to the
receiver of memory for training.
after training, return
immediately to your dwelling.
two, from this moment, you are exempt
from all rules governing rudeness.
you may ask any questions.
three, beside from your daily injection,
you may not receive other medicines.
especially those for pain.
injectat. s752.
four, you may not discuss
your training with anyone.
ever.
- your look so important...
- i don't know...?
- stick out? - oh, yeah,
there is only one receiver of memory.
two.
what have they said? that "you
have the capacity to see beyond"?
the...
can't wait to hear every single detail!
five: you may lie.
asher and i, we used to dare each
other to get closed to his place.
it was built right on the edge.
we all heard of people
getting lost on edge.
never to be seen again.
and yet... here i was.
being told that i have to
get close to it every day.
for the rest of my life.
welcome.
uhm, hi. i'm jonas...
please raise at the sensor.
welcome, receiver of memories.
they're called books.
your books.
- my name is...
- i know who you are.
of course, i apologize.
"i apologized"...?
stop saying that.
"i apologized"... don't apologize to me.
never again, not here.
we haven't time to "apologize".
that's an automatic pleasantry.
it does not mean anything.
i apologise... i'm sorry. i mean...
we are here for only one purpose.
simply stated...
although the words are
really simple at all...
i'll transmits you all the
memories that hold within me.
memories of the past.
i'd be very interested to
learn about your life.
no, no. not..
my life.
you'll learn the secret
history of the world!
before me, before you, the
generations back and back and back.
when things were different:
when there is more.
"more"...?
get... chair.
you see, no one in our community
has any memory of the past.
only me.
when elders need a guide
beyond there experience,
i provide wisdom, that is now your role.
to provide guidance in the present,
using the memories of the past.
come closer.
where to begin...?
come closer.
closer.
there is no way for me to prepare
you for what i'm going to do now.
it's gonna take
comfort to knowing...
you're completely helpless.
if any of this proof too much
for you, tell me immediately.
i just have...
silent night...
holy time...
all sleep...
that was... that...
- how that happened?
- what you mean 'how'? it happened.
- but that's impossible!
- and yet, it happened.
but... why?
why don't we have...
that...
thing...
come on... the memories gave
you the words, not "thing"...
- "sledge"!
- sledge.
and the...
- snow.
- snow...
- but my parents haven't been... did
you...? - no... it's a distinct memory.
simply stated...
there is no snow because
of climate control.
but why all people do
not know about them?
what's so dangerous in
the memory of a sledge?
what's so dangerous...?
for sledge you need snow,
snow is cold, cold destroys crops...
which means farmers could not farm.
unpredictable weather, the
hills, the mountains...
made it difficult to transport of food.
and we had hunger, starvation, famine...
everything is connected,
everything is balance.
where there is good,
there is always bad.
- the two...
- show me more!
let's go for a walk.
a real one, with our legs.
at the bottom of hill...
i saw something.
like a place.
- "home".
- home. yes.
"home"? like a dwelling?
- mr. receiver...
- good morning!
no... it's different.
a dwelling is not a "home".
"home" means more.
your instructions said
i can lie, do you lie?
a, all the time! mostly
for personal amusement.
but i won't lie to you.
how do i know that's not a lie?
there was someone else before me.
what happened to them?
one more question!
if i am now the receiver,
what is that make you?
well. that must make me...
the giver.
so how was it?
- it was good.
- what you do?
- we just talked.
- what else?
that's it.
- you seem different.
- how do you mean?
- i see him tomorrow.
- he cancel them, no matter what i do.
- and you said that you look
after it. - i know, i said.
- i apologize.
- i accept your apology.
- thank you, dinah.
- thank you.
- gabriel! - how did jonas
know the child's name?
- jonas met gabriel the other day.
- it's so cute!
would you like to issue me a
warning, director of justice?
just for a while, mother,
till little guy catch up us.
i think we all agree that
you will sleep in my room.
- only if the elders says it's okay.
- they will.
yeah...
lily, give me a comfort object.
come on, lily, it's time for bed.
- look at this...
- bye, baby!
this is a mythical
creature called "hippo."
and it's incredibly fast, because
it has two, three, four, five legs!
we had the same mark.
and it's very strong...
they almost did not have
to see his to know.
i felt that.
felt that one day gabriel
will be chosen too.
...hippo!
yeah...!
- that's the pain i talked about.
- no... not even close.
- did you...
- how to face!
- why was that thing alive...?
- don't skip your head.
- did you notice anything about them?
- yes: it hurt.
no, any quality.
well maybe...
i think i saw it in friend fiona's hair.
my twist is yellow.
if you thought the slab special...
it's...
"red"!
- just like her hair...
- yes.
there are red, green, blue...
many different colours.
you'll see them all in time.
when our people have chose to...
to away with all of them...
color, race, religion...
they created sameness.
if we were different,
we could be envious...
angry, reasonful...
consumed of hatred.
we need sameness.
- not you think?
- oh, i completely agree!
and still...
also...
it's beautiful.
we always said that
elsewhere is so far-away.
but it wasn't.
it was right there.
close enough to touch.
jonas, have you fallen...?
- do you need immediate help?
- no, i.. i was just...
what's going on with you?
nothing's going on with me.
no you are right, it's totally normal to
lie in the grass and stare at the sky.
no, i was just...
you are seeing something,
aren't you?
can you tell me?
give me your hands.
what do you see?
- oh my goodness...
- you see it?
yes.
it's water.
come on, concentrate.
uhm hi!
jonas was just teaching
me about his training.
as you can see,
it's "incredibly interesting".
it can't be as great as mine.
can't have your minds blow...?
- whoa! do you know how to fly those?
- absolutely!
short off... i'm learning.
when i'm flying, looking
down at everything...
- it's like i'm seeing things for the first
time. - you get to fly into elsewhere?
oh, yeah!
once, when i was
looking at that myst...
even they told us that there
is nothing close to the edge,
i thought i saw a tree
out there somewhere.
don't get too excited, i've
actually seen elsewhere.
just mostly our farm rocks
that kind of stuff.
what's weird about them?
there is these two huge rocks
leaning against each other
making a kind of... triangle.
hey, it's kind like our triangle!
- what's past their?
- don't know.
and now lot of fly past there.
so many secrets...
so what are your secrets?
a... nothing.
what do you mean, "oh, nothing"?
you are receiver of memories.
maybe i can show you.
- okay. grab a tray.
- what...?
bring it over the solar plate, come on!
hey this might seem little
funny, but you gotta trust me.
okay. sit down on the tray.
careful...
- whoa! you're not gonna...
- what are you scared?
i'm scared of anything. i was just..
- it's against the rules, jonas.
- since do you care about the rules?
actually i have auxiliary training.
i'll see you guys.
look who grew up...
lucky for you i haven't.
okay...? now go!
put your heels down, slow down!
i think your training may
be more funnier than mine.
please, standby for a
community announcement.
citizens are reminded that it is rude
to touch community members
outside of your family unit.
thank you.
he is punctual. he is inquisitive.
- how inquisitive?
- he's interested in his position.
then why is he breaking the rules?
he has been observed trying to share his
training with his former classmate.
that always happens.
but it's an impossible experiment.
even i tried to share of the memories
back when i was in training.
if you remember...
so... forget about it.
i don't tell you what to do in
your position, so don't tell me.
i apologise, but...
- isn't that is happening now?
- your apology is accepted, but...
you're being careless.
you are moving too fast,
we both know what happened
ten years ago with the girl.
that girl had a name.
you think i do not
remember her name?
i know i feel the loss.
the boy must hold in the pain.
don't fail us again.
want me to read all these?
uh, what's this...?
"one day you should meet a boy who
answers to the name of jonas."
"he should be the most
powerful of all receivers".
- wait: that says...?
- do not be gullible.
"plan for sameness."
- another trick?
- actually, no.
it's some kind of... map.
triangle of rocks! it's true,
my friend asher actually saw it!
look at all this towers...
what are they for?
how could your friend saw
the triangle of rocks?
he is a pilot, he told me, he saw it.
what's past that? past the "outer
edge, boundary of memories"?
a mystery.
"boundary memories",
that have they built
so the memories only
stay within you and me?
- let's move on.
- wait!
that boundary is meant
to keep the memories in.
so, if a receiver crosses it, is that
means the memories get set free?
perhaps... perhaps
if you and i crossed it,
everyone could feel
those memories again.
so what am i seeing today?
nothing.
you are seeing nothing today.
we already covered "seeing beyond".
there is also such a
thing "hearing beyond".
a table...? all the food
would slip on the floor.
now don't judge me...
i'm not very good.
even though i had a very good teacher.
music...
well... the music when i
press the right keys.
just like music, there's something
else you can see with your eyes.
something lies deep inside you.
something...
this morning injections take away.
i thought injections are for our health.
not, they remove something.
what?
emotions!
you mean my feelings...?
feelings are just fleeded
on the surface.
but emotions they are very deep...
primal... they linger
and join us...
you might not understand where
you are or what's happening.
but don't think about
what you are seeing.
listen!
listen to what's calling from inside.
antonio!
what beautiful wedding!
why would anyone want
to get rid of this?
good question...
- what are you doing...?
- take my hands!
ready?
are you ready for the fast part?
come back!
- spin!
- what are you doing with her?
jonas says it's called dancing.
please, standby for a transmission.
- i apologize for my intervention.
- we accept your apology.
- i just wanted to say hello.
- hello.
- i am lily.
- yes, i know.
you are nine now, isn't it right?
lily, i think it's... time for school.
now we are going.
hello, jonas.
- hello.
- how's your training?
injected.
- fine.
- i'm concerned about the receiver.
- many years ago there was an incident.
- what kind of incident?
living alone in a building at
the edge can isolate a person.
i am concerned that the receiver...
is being reckless.
are you being properly prepared?
- i think so.
- you are focused?
perhaps you are spending too much time
with friends from your childhood?
- i'm focused. - jonas! what do
you in the receiver, actually do?
- my rules say not allow to share.
- she is the elder-chief.
jonas she only wants to help.
you are right.
but you can't tell the
receiver i told you.
you have my word.
we sit on chairs and
don't talk all day long.
and when the time is up, i came back
here and in the morning do all it again.
i apologize, but i'm late.
your apology is accepted.
goodbye mother.
injected.
he is not usually like this.
i'm surprised you're not
more worried about him.
were he my responsibility...
i would be.
we had been told that elder-chief knew
everything. things no buddy else did.
but i had learned that knowing
of what something is...
it's not the same as knowing
how something feel.
you could be the best, the last
one at top of the mountain...
gasping for air, having survived...
and be alone.
be curious.
i got lost... to good king=d of lost!
i saw sites and heard sounds,
i had no words to describe.
faces with different colored skins.
i feel so alive...
is this forbidden?
i did not know what to
think, what to believe.
"have faith", the giver told me.
he said: "faith, that
was seeing beyond."
he compared it to the wind:
something felt but not seen.
don't accept.
what is the truth just because it's
coming from someone you respect.
i feel completely stupid,
a weird feeling.
- fucking weird...
- thing goes in your hand.
memories are not just about the
past, they determine our future.
you can change things,
you can make things better.
it was life..
it just seemed more complete.
the more i experienced,
the more i wanted.
once there were and other living beings.
but unlike us
they knew who their
mothers and fathers were.
they had joy...
and they had pain.
i can't prepare you for whats going...
no need to warn me every single time...
no, jonas. you do not understand:
there are tremendous cruelty...
giver! i'm not a kid anymore. show me.
that's $ 250,000 ivory.
come on. come on!
- put in!
- again, again.
no, stop!
stop!
stop...
hey!
hey, gabe? okay, gabe...
if i tell you a secret, you
promise not to tell anyone?
i'll take that as a "yes."
this comfort object...
is not hippo.
it's an elephant,
and once it was real.
and it was beautiful...
citizens are reminded that sleep
period commences in 15 minutes.
thank you.
it was like a memory,
but fiona was there.
a wait of dream.
- a what?
- a "dream".
a combination of reality, fantasy,
emotions and what you ate for dinner.
you've stopped taking your
injections, isn't you?
emotion was so strong...
and it was the wedding! everyone all
together laughing and dancing...
the older and the young, the bride and
the groom, there was something there.
but different from what we have.
yes...
we don't have that anymore.
what do you mean by that?
i'm talking about what you
feel for someone else.
and mind can not explain it and
you can't make it go away.
- what is it?
- love.
its called "love".
love...
oh hi!
hi!
so what's new?
- what's new with you?
- what's ever new?
- why are you being weird?
- i'm not.
i'm just...
just...
lad the hippo game!
hold on!
father, do you love me?
jonas.
precision of language. please!
what does "love" mean?
i got him, lily.
jonas uses the word so inappropriate
that it no longer has any application.
if you ask, "do you enjoy me"...
the answer is certainly "yes".
or do mother and i take proud
in your accomplishment...
of course we do. do you understand?
yes. i think i finally do.
hey! hey.. gabe...!
i love you, gabriel...
giver! you were right, i asked
my family about love and...
get down... get down!
giver!
they are in the trees! there
are in the trees, robbie!
get down! robbie, get down!
robbie, get down!
robbie, get down! stay down!
i didn't see you, man!
you are in the trees!
stay down!
may day!
we are under intense shooting!
send help!
robbie... robbie!
no...
jonas...
what...?
- i'm sorry jonas...
- how do people do that?
i didn't mean you to receive that.
not for years.
don't.. don't let this
come back to your way.
- i'm not strong enough.
- of course, not yet. but jonas...
this what we need to
know, so we can advise!
i can't... i'm sorry, i can't...
- i just can't.
- jonas!
jonas!
jonas, come back!
please!
come back inside, let me explain it!
when you see something like that...
there is no explanation.
rosemary... promise me
you come back tomorrow!
rosemary!
hey, jonas! come on. you are...
just in time.
i did never wanna go back...
i didn't want the wisdom.
i didn't want the pain.
i just wanted my childhood again.
scrap knees and ball games...
back then we had played "war".
but the war was real.
the elders understood that.
they erased it from our world.
maybe they were right.
- could you watch over harry for me?
- of course.
hey, what's wrong?
- nothing.
- i know you.
- you do, do you?
- yes...
what do you think would happen if
you skip the morning injection?
if you skipped it?
then the sensors would blink and
remind me that i forgot it.
no i don't mean if you forgot, i mean...
what do you think would happen if
you choose not to be injected?
jonas, i thought something is wrong.
there is something wrong.
everything is wrong.
i quit. fiona, i done
being the receiver.
- this morning, i skip the injection.
- wait: "you quit"...?
cut your finger and put
a little blood on this apple.
no, you can't quit, if you quit your
position, you get sent to elsewhere.
leave in the morning,
put the apple over the sensor,
- it will find your blood and think it's
your hand. - stop, you're scaring me.
fiona, you need you to do this,
i need you to feel what i know.
jonas.
an apple wouldn't even work.
i've been doing it for months,
since worked every single time.
don't quit, you can't leave.
i don't think i can go
back to that place.
- you will, if you want me to do this.
- okay, fine.
but tomorrow, after work,
meet me in the triangle.
i wanted to share with her.
not all of it, but good things.
was i wrong to one that?
i thought about her now. all the time.
hello...? i have something to show you.
come here!
who are you?
come over here and try this.
- me...?
- me?
yeah, i wanna teach you.
you've come back.
- where did you learn that?
- from the memories you gave me.
and you can done it quit?
it's beautiful.
who's that?
this...
is rosemary.
the previous receiver.
she is the one that all talk about.
it no longer exists...
except here.
and in my memories.
she was in training
only two short months.
look how the fingers move...
unlike you.
she wanted to experience...
well, everything!
i've only give her pleasant
beautiful memories.
she fought me...
- don't protect me!
- no!
don't show me a map and then
not give me all the memories.
- i thought we're gonna help.
- we will.
- but must move slow.
- show it to me!
you gave her war?
i gave her the memory of child.
a child taken from her mother.
i gave her loss...
too soon!
you need to gonna hang on this.
the light went from her eyes...
next morning, without telling me...
she went to elder-chief
and asked to be released.
so she was released. and
now lives in elsewhere.
yes, receiver.
i'd like to see this morning's release.
thank you for your instructions.
okay...
that's my father!
this one is heavier.
- more twins! great!
- watch!
oh, good...
for a moment i thought
that was exactly the same.
- here we go...
- then we have a problem!
- okay...
- thank you, dinah.
- hey new...
- ... possessed stand.
only one unit less.
oh, i know it hurts, i know...
but you put into a vein, and
the your arms are too tiny.
almost there...
okay! it wasn't so bad, was it?
that's death.
- he doesn't know what he is doing.
- "doesn't know what he is doing"...?
- he killed him!
- but he doesn't know what it means.
just like you did,
neither did rosemary.
how can he not see the baby isn't moving?
doesn't that tell him something is wrong?
the young and the older killed.
your friend, fiona, she will soon
be trained to release as well.
that's a lie. she would never do that.
- if fiona understood...
- we are the only one who understand it.
then it's our fault.
you, me and all the receivers
back and back and back and back.
perhaps to be a way to show them.
give them memories so
they can understand!
- yes...
- because if you can't feel...
- what's the point?
- what... what can you do?
did it work? i don't know how long it
takes for the injection to leave you,
- but there a day was long enough...
- why i do this, jonas?
on the walk here i was thinking
of how was i scold you.
how i was say always,
fine for you to break the rules,
because you are chosen...
when i thought about
telling you, i just i...
i began to think about you.
was this okay?
do you feel anything?
- it feels like...
- fiona.
- what do you feel?
- i do not know, i don't...
have words to describe it.
warm...? does it feel warm?
- warm...?
- does it feel nice?
no, i'm on the night shift, i need to...
i don't feel right, jonas.
i need to go and get my
injection, i need to go to work.
- what was that?
- fiona, there is more.
so much more.
i remember it now. i dreamed it.
when i was younger.
i told my parents...
"it was the sturning" they said.
"everyone had them."
"medication would stop them.
nothing be couldn't we fixed."
"precision of language"
and the teacher said:
- "that's right, lily".
- very good!
jonas... just in time for feelings.
- lily telling us how...
- where's gabe?
uncertain was returned
to the nurturing center.
- what happened?
- he failed his test of maturity.
again. i couldn't ask
for another extension,
so i have to release
into elsewhere.
- released him...? - i certainly
gave best choice, didn't we?
- but he is family.
- precision of language, please!
sit down. eat with us.
i just need to rest for a while.
i hadn't been wrong, this was wrong.
i hadn't eliminated murder,
they brought it home!
they just called it by a different name.
father, he didn't know any better.
i did.
jonas, what are you doing?
it's against the rules to leave
your community this late.
asher, there is something
i have to do,
it's right, but it's
sort of against the rules.
if it's right thing to do...
how can it be against the rules?
there are things i've learned that
you don't know, that you can't know,
- not because it's your fault... - jonas
you need to go back to your family unit!
but that's the point!
it isn't my family!
and neither is yours!
- asher, i gotta go. - jonas, listen!
- get out of my way. - jonas, listen!
what are you...?
giver!
giver! wake up.
- i don't do sleeping to wake up.
- something can be done.
- something can be done!
- what do you purpose?
all the memories back and back and
back and back can be returned.
i need to leave the community, i need
to find the boundary of memories.
- and then?
- and then cross it!
- no more discussion.
- a slowly...
- gabe is in danger.
- slowly.
i can't wait anymore!
something must be done!
if you had that map, then why
you didn't try to leave?
i was waiting, for someone like you.
you're the reason we
have a chance, so...
the plan will be for you
to go and for me to stay.
if you did cross this boundary...
and if the memories are set free, all
of the pain that you felt all the...
confusion, chaos, it would all return!
- so you have to stay to help them?
- yes.
and for my daughter.
that's what you would have wanted.
- your daughter...?
- rosemary.
now: your friend if he truly
saw the triangle of rocks...
bring up jonas activity for
the past year as well.
- so asher came directly to you?
- yes.
what was jonas's disposition
at the evening meal?
dissatisfied. anxious. indignant.
setup a communication with
the receiver's memory.
we're not permitted to see
into the receiver's residence.
- we can only transmit.
- well then we shall only transmit.
if you go, head towards the triangle,
away from the other communities.
that will lead to boundary of memories.
please, standby for a transmission.
- i apologize for your intrusion.
- i accept your apology.
we have a problem: receiver
in training is missing,
and he physically attacked
his friend, asher.
- he did? that's serious.
- do you know where jonas is?
i do not.
well thank you very much for...
helping us to narrow
down the possibilities.
- i'll contact you if he comes here.
- only if it not in the imposition.
thank you.
he is lying...
- talk!
- they are going to kill gabe.
i'm leaving, i'm leaving tonight
and i'm going to take him with me.
jonas not yet, you're not ready.
when they decided to kill gabe,
they decided i was ready.
i like this map, don't mess it
up, i'll be wanting it back.
do you mind if i accelerate
your training a bit?
you'd think that someone who
is the keeper of emotions,
then i would be better...
well...
i love you, jonas.
look... here it is.
you have the courage...
let me give you the strength.
can i just...
attention all community residents.
receiver in training has been
reported missing from his dwelling.
please be alert,
you may be in danger.
group 1, from the inside edge.
then group 2, from the center.
no i think like this.
welcome to the nurturing center.
- shall i convey the others?
- yes.
jonas! i heard an alert.
what's going on?
hey, where's gabe? is he here?
- is any of this? - if he is back then,
he be with youngsters in
- restricted floor.
- show me where.
fiona! please.
they are down stairs, come on.
jonas was chosen for the most
important position in our community.
he was asked if he was strong enough.
it turned out he was not.
instead, he's a rebel.
will must be stopped.
by you.
when you find him...
take him.
- gabe is in danger.
- jonas, he is fine, i'll show you.
no, he is not fine.
he should be here.
- fiona: i'm leaving, tonight.
- "leaving"?
- what do you mean?
- i'm taking gabe.
we are leaving the community.
i want you to come with us.
i don't have the words to describe it.
fiona there is more. so much more.
what are they doing?
- fiona: what do you feel?
- i don't have the words to describe it.
attention nurturers.
please secure your work area
and immediately report to
the newborn's nursery,
to allow for security
search procedures.
promptly report all sightings
at the nearest security kiosk.
thank you.
fiona, we gotta go now!
you, me and gabe!
jonas, i can't what about my family
unit the other new children?
i can't leave them.
this the only way, this is the
only way to make everything okay.
i can't go.
when i get there, you'll understand.
- i'll come back for you.
- jonas!
come back!
now go, jonas!
hey freeze, freeze!
subject lost to the edge.
search terminated.
and i asked him why he was out so late.
he seemed angry.
i didn't understand why,
but i wanted to help him.
then it hit me,
and at first time...
i can tell why you've
been acting this way,
your injections levels
are extremely low.
i can correct that.
"friends forever" right...?
then we will addressed what's happened.
when i went over the edge,
we shouldn't have made it.
this was a miracle.
the giver had talked about them.
he told me that i could draw
strength from the memories.
i knew, by giving them to gabe,
i could protect them.
cut your finger and put a
little blood on this apple.
when you leave in the morning,
put the apple over on the sensor.
i've been doing it for months,
since worked every single time.
what has he taught...?
a dwelling is not a "home".
this the only way to
make everything okay.
gabe is in danger. what they are
gonna do him is really bad.
i want you to come with us.
when i get there, you'll understand.
i'll come back for you.
yes...
careful...
careful.
i apologize...
for failing again.
i don't think you failed.
i think you succeeded.
with your plan...
ever since the girl was released
you haven't been the same.
i genuinely hoped jonas would help you.
it would have fresh start, if
you two have work together...
which is seems you have.
we will find jonas.
jonas, our receiver of
memories, lost to the edge.
jonas...! jonas...!
- how did they know jonas is gone?
- we must not says his names anymore.
- i will.
- you must keep quiet now, lily.
and hippo is really "an elephant".
what i'm about to tell you, you
must never repeat to anyone.
- i don't believe jonas is lost.
- but the ceremony of loss...
i'm not sure of it.
i don't expect you
to understand,
but you must know that
jonas has become dangerous.
he must be stopped.he must not get
beyond the triangle of rocks.
what you want me to do?
you know, jonas,
i want you to find him.
and then...
i want you to lose him.
power depleted.
jonas...
- what are you doing...?
- asher please, let us go.
i can't. i supposed to...
to what?
to loose you.
asher... if you're my friend...
if you were ever my friend... can
you please somehow trust me?
trust me now.
i do trust you, jonas.
come on, please...
jonas...!
you found him!
i did.
for the good of all of us...
i beg you, to finish this.
its finished.
hey. it's okay...
nothing the giver had shown me, had
prepared me for the voices in my head.
screaming me to stop.
but i knew that fiona will
be punished for helping me.
asher, for let me go.
the only way to help them,
to keep them alive...
was to get to the boundary.
if it even existed.
i strengthened gabe with memories
of having enough and knowing joy.
it was in memory of fiona
for kept me going.
fiona?
i have taken care of everything.
we've arranged for your release.
it will be a nice ceremony.
now you get some rest.
- i felt things.
- what?
- i know that there is something more.
- fiona...
something missing from our lives.
no, not "missing", something
that has been stolen
from me and from you.
i do not know what it is exactly.
but jonas does.
i had felt things. and they were warm...
and they were nice.
and they were beautiful.
i have felt things. i have felt things!
i have felt things...!
where is the tower, gabe?
tower should be here...
you can stop this...
stop what?
if you don't wanna see it, sit
down with the other elders.
or close your eyes!
ceremony of release to elsewhere.
come on, fiona.
you're comfortable?
i'm not uncomfortable, i'm afraid.
you don't have to be afraid.
you know me.
i will be very gentle, i promise.
okay...?
her name was rosemary.
she was my daughter.
- i loved her...
- precision of language.
i could not be more precise.
do you know what that's like?
to love someone?
i do.
i cried.
i felt sorrow...
i've sang, danced...
i felt real joy...
then you should know better then anyone.
you have seen children starv...
da.
you have seen people stabbing
on each other's neck...
just for the view.
you know what it is peoples like
when men blow each others up.
yes.
- over a simple land, sand...
- i do, i do.
- but...
- and yet...
and yet! you and jonas want
to open that door again.
- bring all that back.
- if you only could see possibilities...
- but why?
- of love!
with love comes faith,
with comes hope...
love is just passion that can turn.
it turns into contempt! and murder!
we could choose better!
people are weak. people are selfish.
when people have freedom to choose...
they choose wrong.
every single time.
that's a sledge...
loss... and the pain...
music, joy...
these all are impossible,
beautiful feeling of love.
your son, he felt it.
the girl...
- she is felted.
- that's enough.
we are living a life of shadows.
of echoes, of fake distant
whispers of once made is real.
excuse me for one second, fiona.
we must continue.
i wish i would have been there
when the memories returned.
they were the truth.
the elders and their rules were lie.
so i do not apologize.
i knew fiona was safe.
that i'd see her again.
and that i held the
future there in my arms.
the giver had led us here.
to this house...
it was real.
from far behind me, from
the place i had left...
i thought i heard music too.
perhaps it was only an echo.
but it was enough.
it will lead us all home.
