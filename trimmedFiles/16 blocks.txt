i know you been
working all night, jack...
...but who's the detective
and who's the lieutenant here?
i mean, jack, i got nobody else.
it's a nothing thing.
one hundred and eighteen minutes
to get a little hemorrhoid 16 blocks.
i'll let you come in
to work late tomorrow.
yeah, yeah.
edward bunker.
yeah, that's me, officer.
eddie bunker, right here.
down here, the last cell.
- come back in an hour.
- what do you mean, come back?
he's supposed to wear a suit
when he leaves.
- and?
- it's not here yet.
just get him out here, all right?
they said he'd wear a suit.
no, yeah, i'm supposed to get a suit.
it's a three-piece suit. it's gray.
it's got... wait. yeah.
it's a three-button, it's gray,
it's got cuffs on the pants.
they brought the catalogue down.
i picked it out of the catalogue.
i'm not supposed
to leave without it. wait.
i'm not supposed to leave
without that suit.
- you tell it to him.
- no, that's why you brought my shoelaces.
- come on, come on.
- i'm not supposed to.
- yo, yo, you take the old lady, right?
- yeah, you sure?
the old lady goes into the car,
otherwise she dies.
- you think so?
- yeah, man.
that's what... i don't know. you gotta
figure out the answer for yourself.
everybody just calm down.
officer, i'm going to court.
- i'm supposed to have a suit.
- hey.
shut up. here's your property.
- it's not a good sign.
- hands behind your back.
- hold on, i'm trying...
- hands behind your back.
i don't even have my...
all my prop... wait one minute.
it's not right.
they promised me the suit.
i picked it out of the catalogue...
wait, my book.
i can't leave without my book.
my book is very important to me.
why are we rushing like this?
it's not a good sign.
- hey.
- what's the damn answer?
- hey!
- shut up.
- i hate police.
- half a tank.
you could have had
a little more patience.
this suit don't mean nothing to you.
you probably got a bunch of suits.
but it's a whole different thing to me.
these cars don't ever change, huh?
traditional cruisers.
and the same retarded hump
in the middle.
smell the same way,
like lysol and vomit.
i hope nobody vomited back here.
they probably did.
hey, man, let me ask you something.
i'm trying to figure this out.
you driving along
in your hurricane, right?
there's three people at the bus stop.
yeah, one is an old lady.
she's sick, she about to die.
the second one is your best friend.
he saved your life, right?
and the third is the girl of your dreams.
right, but check it out...
...you only got space in the car
for one person.
right? who you take?
it's a riddle that's supposed to tell
what type of person you are...
...like where you at in your life.
it's a hypothetical question, man, damn.
it's just a hypothetical...
well, good. fine, good.
i guess that's my answer.
why don't you get
on the loudspeaker?
put the hawaii five - 0 light on
or something.
use your police power.
put on a little siren.
make room, make a hole.
isn't that the saying,
"make a hole, make a hole"?
go on, make a hole.
signs. everywhere, signs, signs, signs.
all over, man.
i used to not even see
nothing like that, man.
and then i start seeing them.
and i start looking for them.
and everything just start falling in place.
i'm gonna be all right,
where i'm supposed to be.
i ain't got my suit,
but once they get my testimony...
...they drop my charges, i'm free.
it's making sense to me.
i believe in that.
being in the right place.
being where you supposed to be.
you believe in that?
i believe life's too long
and guys like you make it even longer.
life's too long?
damn.
that's some cold shit, man. i ain't never
heard nobody say no shit like that.
usually you hear about people
trying to make their life longer, you know?
trying to stay alive a little longer.
you sound a little...
...depressed or something, you all right?
you stopping?
this ain't the courthouse, man.
what you doing?
yo.
yo, why you stopping?
you gonna rush me out to court,
and now you stopping? what are you...?
hey. hey, man.
hey, man. listen, man, i got an important
appointment after my court date, man.
that shit ain't funny, man.
come on, man. it's not a game, man.
yo.
some bullshit, man.
hey. hey!
no, man. it ain't miller time, man.
<i>the weather will be clear early morning,
but the rest of the day...</i>
sam. hey, angela.
<i>so we are looking at a hot, humid day.</i>
<i>looks like temperature
might reach 100 degrees...</i>
<i>...so don't forget
to pack your sunscreen.</i>

i know this dude smelled funny.
i got the wrong dude, man.
- 17,50.
- what?
hey, don't open it. come over here.
what time is it, man?
it's 8:11.
that's a good sign. that's a good sign.
i'm on my way. i'm gonna get there.
- want change?
- no, you keep the change.
keep the change.
all right, you have a good day.
- i don't want the peanuts.
- bye.
no, man. can't do nothing for you,
understand?
hey, you better give me that change.
i'm gonna need that.

- you having fun?
- no.
- no? oh, well.
gotta have fun.
- what's up, jack?
- hey, man. hi.
you did a really great, great job, man.
you got yourself a bad guy.
been a while, huh? yeah.
we got the second shooter
half a block from here, so it's done.
- sure you're okay?
- yeah.
i'm just getting my wind. i was running.
why don't you let us take it from here.
oh, yeah.
we'll get the kid where he belongs,
and you don't have to worry about a thing.
- we'll get you home.
- yes, please.
please, please, officer.
that's a very good idea...
...because, honestly, i don't think
this dude is doing too good.
i told him not to stop.
i asked him not to stop.
he just had to stop.
that's when everything happened.
dude came to the window.
i have a very important
appointment aft...
jack.
hey, shue.
come on. here.
why don't you take this. come on.
we'll get you out of here.
got a car waiting. all right?
get some sleep.
jack?
the kid was gonna testify against jerry.
he saw jerry doing some business.
now, we both know that jerry has never
been a standup guy like you and me.
he'll roll over, they indict him.
we can't have that.
no. it's gonna hurt a lot of us.
come on.
see, this whole thing caught us...
it caught us completely unaware.
it was supposed to be
teach's nephew driving him.
but he got stuck out there in traffic,
who knows where...
...so then your lieutenant, he pegged you.
you know, just the wrong time
and the wrong place for you today.
all right. now, you know that i would never
put you in a position like this, right?
you know that, huh?
and i never figured
you'd cap one of those guys.
- that's what i get for hiring drug addicts.
- grab the gun.
grab the gun. there you go.
come on. frank?
- here we go.
- all right, here we go. jack.
squeeze the trigger.
all right. let go of the gun.
let go of the gun.
i figure it like this.
you... you pop the guys
trying to spring the kid.
the kid, well, he gets your gun.
and he takes you hostage.
so we came in and saved the day.
he died, you lived.
now, this could be a good thing
for you, jack.
get you back where you belong.
- are you still with?
- stand up.
- you still with what's-her-name?
- come on, stand up.
- what are you waiting for?
- what's her name?
caroline.
it's caroline.
this changes everything, jack.
over here.
come on, frank.
kid, get up. come on.
shit. man, shit.
all right, jack, it's 8:25.
- you stay there.
- listen to me, the jury's tenure ends at 10.
all right? the kid gets there
one minute past, all this...
...it doesn't matter.
and all you gotta do
is look the other way.
all right? we still got options here.
okay?
we just want the kid.
jack, jack, jack,
just let me help you.
all right?
back up.
jack, once you go out that door...
...i can't help you.
please just back up, frank.
just back up.
he shot a cop.
what the hell did you see?
what did you see?
that cop back there.
i seen him around my way...
...holding a gun in this
little puerto rican kid's mouth.
come on. let's go.
he said he'd kill his mother
if he testified.
what you doing that for?
we need that.
the shell in that gun was over 20 years old.
lucky it went off at all.
- they didn't tell you shue was a cop?
- no, they didn't tell me he was a cop.
they showed me a picture, that was it.
they didn't say nothin'.
well, congratulations, because you're about
to testify against one of new york's worst.
- what?
- fellas, look, the clock's ticking.
he's gotta be at the courthouse by 10.
we know where he's going.
mulvey, you're coming with me.
- know where you're going?
- take the north side.
- you got it, let's go.
- come on.
- captain.
- where are we, frank?
well, we're putting descriptions out
over precinct channels.
no names, or that one's a cop.
it'll help to have some eyes.
- how long can you sit on this?
- he shot a cop.
you're the precinct captain, dan.
how long?
i don't know.
hour, maybe a little more.
- who's on this with you?
- my guys.
ortiz and maldonado from the 66.
touhey and kaller from the 111.
a couple others
you don't wanna know about.
the guy was your partner for 20 years.
what the hell happened in there?
- is he drunk?
- i don't know.
i don't know. we woke him up.
hopefully he'll do what he always does,
and we can go back to work.
if he doesn't?
we gotta quash this thing
before he gets his legs back.
these are his streets.
this could get ugly for all of us
if that kid talks.
- he can't talk.
- he won't talk.
look, i appreciate
what you did for me back there...
...but i'm starting to think
you're not the dude for this.
i mean, you're out of breath,
you're hung-over.
your leg is gonna give out on you
any second, man.
i got someplace i need to be at 12,
you understand?
i need to be finished at court by 10...
...or i'm not gonna get
where i'm supposed to get.
- you understand what i'm saying?
- all right, i understand.
- you're not listening to what i'm saying.
- wait, come here. come here.
come on.
hung-over.
a bad leg.
no gun.
- bobby?
- yeah?
<i>- you thinking what i'm thinking?</i>
- i'm already there.
oh, god.
come on, let's go.
listen, just stay put right here.
i'll be right back.
come on, man, don't take long.
we gotta go.
hurry up.
- hey, man, where your bathroom?
- what?
your bathroom. where your bathroom at?
down at the end of the hall.
yeah.
that's what you look like
when you smile, huh?
you was probably drinking then too.
there's the lady.
redhead. she cute. that ain't bad.
hey, man. come on, don't be stopping
to get high or nothing like that.
man, we gotta go.
make sure you lift the seat up
before you go.
it's up already.
maybe you left it like that, huh?
i'm coming.
hey, jack.
jack mosley.
why did you do that?
do what?
shoot that cop.
cops...
...they don't shoot other cops.
especially over nobody like me.
it's a long way to go for a stranger,
you know.
thank you.
i never had nobody...
hell, man, you know.
i don't rock with the police,
you know what i'm saying?
- finger off the trigger.
- they never been my friend.

let's go.
- jack...
- put your arms around the pole.
i don't know what to think anymore.

you should have done
what you always do, jack.
- where's your phone?

if i don't answer it...
- jack?
- let's go, kid. come on.
- bob.
<i>- bob's a little tied up right now, frank.</i>
<i>all right, i'm impressed, jack.</i>
did you shoot him too?
send someone to check on bobby.
<i>jack, you're not up to this.</i>
<i>all right? it's gonna end bad for you.</i>
you lost the kid, didn't you?
<i>he bailed on you.
well, you know what?</i>
<i>that is the best thing
that could have happened.</i>
<i>so why don't you go home.</i>
forget about what happened.
we'll take it from here.
are you looking for him?
<i>and you can't find him.</i>
<i>we're gonna find him, all right?</i>
<i>we're gonna find him.</i>
all right, jack, now you can hang up.
where are you, kid?
all right. now, let's see
which way he went.
did he go up? did he go down?
in or out, jackie.
which way did he go?
let's see if he went down.

...being a motorman.

- pull me in! help me in!
- come on, come on, come on.

- yeah.
jack, what are we doing?
where are we going?
- come on.
- where we going, jack?

courthouse is in this direction, jack?
jack? we gotta know...
down! head down!
go!
come on!
kaller!

you all right, jack?
i was aiming for the kid,
if that makes you feel better.
well, you missed!
that kid is gonna get you killed.
he worth that?
well, i got all day.
how about you, you got all day?
- jack, you still there?
- yeah.
still here.
well, this is awkward.
when i started this day...
...i never figured on trading
i think we stopped being friends
right around 8:25, in that bar.
no.
no, that's not gonna erase
we're still friends.
look...
...a lot i'd take back, but i can't.
well, so you move forward.
next day, next case.
- lines were crossed.
- what lines?
- you hear me? lines were crossed, frank.
- what lines? there are no lines!
there's getting it done
and not getting it done, period!
you put the bad guys away
no matter what it takes.
now, you're gonna ruin the lives...
...of six cops.
good cops.
good men.
are you ready to sacrifice
their lives for that kid?
hey, frank.
- frank.
- yeah?
this is not about me
ruining anybody's life.
okay? this is about you.
you hear me?
yeah.
you look at that kid's jacket?
i did.
- armed robbery, assault, beats old women...
- i never had no armed robbery!
beats old women over the heads,
steals their social security checks.
- one time, i used...
- shut up. shut up.
oh, no, don't tell him to shut up.
no, jack, listen to him.
no, that kid, he's sharp.
yeah, he's playing you.
he's sharper than you are.
he's telling you stories, right?
he wants to be a good citizen.
go to church.
buy his mother a house.
but he has spent
more than half his life in prison.
two hours ago, he was sitting in a cell
for weapons possession.
- he's always gonna do what he has done.
- i wasn't...
he is a career criminal.
that's who you're protecting.
- you all right?
- yeah. frank's got him on the other side.
he's got my gun too.
now, if you can't see
how wrong this is...
...i promise you
i will speak from my heart...
...when i give the eulogy at your funeral.
so...
...do you believe the kid?
or do you believe your ex-partner?
frank, we're right
on the other side of the door.
because...
...if you believe the kid...
...you got a choice to make.
do you go through your ex-partner?
or do you choose door number two...

that you're a self-medicating,
depressed individual.
and you don't care
about anything or anyone.
oh, she's honest, straightforward.
that's sexy. i like that.
what'd you do this time, jack?
he saved my life a couple times.
hey, he's a good dude.
you gotta give him another chance.
i don't know what he did,
but you gotta give him another chance.
he gotta have somebody to talk to.
i'm not gonna be around.

nothing's gonna make me feel better.
then why?

when we cleared the tough cases.
it didn't bother you
doing any of that until...

okay, jack? really listen.
whatever you think
that you are gonna do up there...
...it is never gonna happen.
you are not gonna make it.

you're gonna shoot me down here?
nobody knows?
like the ling family, huh?

who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.

in some guy's mouth.

look, if it hadn't happened
the way that it did, if he hadn't died...

on the back, saying, "good job."
collateral damage,
it is a fact of life in this business.

wiping the fingerprints off the room.
