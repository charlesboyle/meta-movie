mr evans alone in his car.
- here you go.
thank you.
they've been putting it all day. a
who cares , it was just a dealer.

among youth and traffickers.
mr evans was arrested 3 years ago
to organize and operate a gang
east london . he also admitted
distributing cocaine and heroin.
how do you know this caleb?
out there. you know these people
waste time on introductions.

what do you have ?
this is then . this is
's going to be things.
i 'm a blind eye while
are you killing people all over london .
you know as well as i , that this
it is the only way to solve this.
what really happens if you catch one ?
would you take the declaration, you process ...
while laughing at you, i spit in the face .
i get in a comfortable cell ...
resting her fucking ass
playing video games.
this country has changed. the
protests are just hunger .
there was a time that would have bled
to maintain the union, jack.
but those days passed .
we have a generation of attackers
those who do not know what to do, griff.
and you know as well as i do
there is nothing stopping them from doing it again.
i am .
revenge never
give a close .
revenge?
this is not vengeance. it is necessity.
get me an address.
- how many?
- two .
we do not know how they were mrs.
guilbert . you can describe them.
one had a black and white hat, the
i do not remember the other . it happened very fast.

- one second.

an appointment at 1 pm with the superintendent ,
and do not want to lose me .
if i'm not shit.
assault with a deadly weapon , two
suspects like 40.
mr oliver tried to remove one
gun and shot him in the chest.
a mrs guilbert they targeted him
as he stole .
cruel. it seems quite work.
- any surveillance camera ?
yes, but nothing .
what was trying to disarm it?
i do not know . protecting ?
your business ?
well, what a way to
finish . no?
- listen agent. what's your name ?
-griffin .
this is probably a robbery
any . do not take it so personal.
she will bill insurance and
everyone will be happy.
and the suspects?
send a team to investigate the area.
you may delay , but ... so is justice.
it is enough for me. thank you.
- a little dry tonight.
- no, i am a lousy drinker .
yeah? define shocking.
put it this way :
the last time i got drunk , i ended
a wet t-shirt contest .
- oh , yeah?
- i won, of course.
course.
what kind of drunk are you?
i am quiet and quite let go .
unlike others
i assume the effects of alcohol.
i try to have a good time .
and that's your analysis
my character ?
no, but realize
you are cautious , timid .
and i can recognize that you die
afraid that if you take that cup ...
that dress is going to end up on the floor of
my room. and your panties in my collection .
i do not wear any .
sorry for the delay, guys.
thirsty , baby?
then . where were we?

have you ever stabbed
someone?
that's a 6op ...
yes , it takes 9 bullets in the chamber .
effective in a range of 50 meters.

you should get another
silencer for that.
jimmy , you should know that i am no
in this. i did it to help but ...
i appreciate that.
jimmy ... see you in a
time, and you know well.
the look in your eyes no

-no! no! ...

because you talk on the phone?
what am i scared?

pliers of mouth , i think
that dentists use .
it seems some kind
sex toy .

he should have swallowed, and
eventually die suffocated .
dried cement all
internal organs together .
if you hit the body with a
object , possibly break .

in 2003 he was in new york in
missing area .
at the time i was there , do not
can you imagine the smell that was there.
which city ! in addition also
was in august.
listen, people are not interested
whether there is a puncher .
not interested in talking newspapers
violations ...
but the kicker grows itself is a
problem . the city will begin to stink.
do you understand where i'm going with this?
what role do you play in the story?
i am the one who cleans the shit
to keep the streets safe .
if you do you 're an idiot.
the cleaning the streets is a
great fool .
do not pull the boat without knowing what
first : it's your own city.
- it would be good to be a superintendent is not it?
'yes, sir
quick grab this guy. you grab and
you get off the streets and keep the media out .
if the commissioner finds that
this is out of control , you are
far from here before
you know it . do you understand ?
yes , sir.
- anything else ?
- no, just coffee . please.
- can i get you anything sir ?
- a tea , please.
yes in a moment.
- is it cold enough . no?
- yes .
have we met?
i will need all
you got it.
well, that will not happen friend.
he belongs to us
us, not you.
i belong , if you take the law in
his hands in my city.
let me explain something .
in september 2009 , we detected a
attempted attack on british soil
a magnitude that would seem 11
september as the teddy bear picnic .
we made it to the man
he planned the attack.
the taliban fell us
up as rain .
it was a struggle as the
has ever been .
we could not get what
needed at that time.
it took 10 minutes to type vickers ,
spit to make all information.
while we were fighting ,
after vickers
execute the prisoner .
you realize that these people ...
not afraid of death.
they welcome .
so i must ask ...
where i get the value.
we were in danger so
we had to go there.
there was no sign of vickers .
it appeared three days after
the bastion , without a scratch .
no one knows how.
if you do not want to
are, they will not.
it ends with these types
and then ...
... disappear.
well, i'll find ,
because it's what i do .
if you touch a finger to my boy ,
i will come so hard ...
who painted the streets with you.
commissioner shield guess.
superintendent walsh.
- who do we see ?
-carter .
and who would that mr. carter?
it would be the chief carter.
thank you gentlemen for coming so quickly .
we apologize but the details
should go straight to the point .
this man is the subject of
an investigation.
under no circumstances will
taken into custody .
understood?
maybe we should meet
formalities and start again.
i am the commissioner shields london.
and you are ?
the man who makes sure you
and the rest of this exquisite country
you are safe every second of
each day .
although we ashamed to speak. this
individual belongs to us .
the directed research report
units to you and to us.
is that clear?
could you tell me who you work for ?
you can tell who works within a
military, which benefits us
his character profile .
the csis .
it is a problem that does not
in the streets.
a problem that only
we can deal with.
and i need it back,
where it belongs.
what caraj ... !
open your mouth , open
touch the door,
play it now .

i do not know what your fucking problem .
who pays you ?

great coincidence that the last official to have
access to the files of these men was you.
before their deaths, i might add.

currently serving service
in his majesty 's forces .
mid not mince words , we know that
would you believe it ?
i want to know when
catch him.
already finished or miss more ?
i need to know who's next .
you do not need to know anything .
all you have to do is
out of the way .
i 'm not gonna get out of the way of anyone .
i'll find the lock you and
the last thing i would do is leave
ud that it encloses .
i 'll sweep , or die
the attempt.
" dying to " not
enough for me.
every time you see a " vigilante"
in my streets , will have an answer .
he does not care ud .
he does not care law.
only interested in one thing:
revenge .
will do more justice in a week
what we do in a year.
do we ?
sr griffih , i think we can say
he stopped being a cop at the time
that began
help his friend .
well, good luck finding it .
it may take a while.
but justice is slow
better than no justice.

austerities until 2018 . "
