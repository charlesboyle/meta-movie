this hancock's latest act
of so-called heroics...
took a hefty financial toll.
initial damage estimates are
said to top $9 million...
which if accurate...
represents a
personal record...
for the notoriously
publicity-shy hancock...
who as usual can't be
reached for comment.
with all the cracks to the concrete
all the bullets water damage fires...
l.a. would be better off
if this guy would leave...
and let us get on
with our jobs..

looked everywhere for you.

viper room and jumbo's...

- no what? - i ain't
gonna fly you.
i got a cousin narelle. she's my
best friend in the entire world...
and i swear to god she would not be
here today if it wasn't for you.
she crashed her car up in malibu
when you flew her to the hospital.

i will break my foot
off in your ass woman.

so your face doesn't tear off.
what do you think?
sir? ray embrey.
- ray.
- pleasure.
- so... - ray's like
the bono of p.r.
well actually i think bono is
the bono of p.r. but i do try.
well let's see it.
okay. i'll get right into it.
good morning everyone.
i'm here to talk to you
about charitable giving.
okay? and we all know
the way that works.
you give one maybe two
percent of your net cash...
and you get an armband or a ribbon or
whatever. it's nowhere near enough.
and that's why we at embrey publicity
would like to offer you...
the allheart symbol.
now you would be among a very
select group of corporate giants...
to bear this logo
on your product.
and what this would
say to the public...
is that your company
pharmatopsis...
has made a radical contribution
to helping our world.
here's all you need
to do to qualify.
your new tb drug mycodin?
we would like for you to give
that product away for free.
- did you say "free"?
- i did.
only to those who need it.
only to those who without
it would otherwise die.
as a concept free is kind of up there
with you know lethal side effects.
- mandatory product recall.
- get indicted go to jail.
get out work at ihop for
the rest of your career.
understandable reaction.
it's a radical concept.
but it is the brand that represents
a fairer and better world.
the brand...
that everyone is talking about.
who is "everyone"?
we do already have a
sports franchise.
- nfl? nba? mlb?
- soccer.
mls? which team?
well it's a local team.
encino hurricanes.
it's my son's team.
anyway we can save the world.
all right? someone's
just gotta go first.
what do you say?
are you a crackpot?
hey hon. you're probably at
the store. i am on my way.
i think i made a connection.
not really.
listen tell aaron that i'm
coming and i... damn it.
and i want some meatballs okay?
i need some spaghetti madness.
i'll see you in about 20 minutes.
hey! what is it
national horn day?

get him out of there!
will you look at that?
- ah shit. - i'm all right.
- i'm okay.
all of you people...
blocking the intersection...
you're all idiots.
you threw the dude's car at her.
and what's with the train?
why didn't you just go straight
up in the air with the car?
you've obviously injured
that poor woman.
- she's right. she should sue you.
- yeah she should sue you.
well you should sue mcdonald's
because they fucked you up.
you're an asshole.
and i can smell that
liquor on your breath.
- because i've been drinking bitch.
- you're a drunk asshole!
- you think you're such a hero.
- asshole!
- you're nothing but an asshole.
- we don't need you in this city.
some superhero you are! fly off!

train. if it wasn't for that guy...

eagle on your hat?

this guy's like a little
talking machine huh?
we don't have a lot
of guests over here.

we started spaghetti madness
about two years ago.
we do it every thursday and we
have not missed a thursday in...

some good meatballs boy.

yeah? no more problems
with that bully michael?
- michel. but not like a girl's name.
- michel. no no i know.
- it's french. - yeah.
- michel hancock is this...
hancock? michel is this
neighbourhood bully.
we've been trying to
teach aaron a little...
about conflict resolution.
you know what i mean?
- yeah. turn the other cheek all that?
- that's exactly right.
well just never turn
that one all right?
never let them punk you.
- got it mr. hancock.
- aaron eat.
the way you deal with bullies
you take your right foot...
bring it right up and catch
him in his little piss pump.
you don't have to do that
honey okay? seriously.
it's a good idea.
you aim straight and make sure
he can't use that thing...
for nothing but a flap to keep
the dust out of his butt crack.
okay please just stop.
michel is not a man okay?
he's a little boy.
and his parents...
happen to be going through a bad
divorce. that's why he's acting up.
maybe you don't know this...
but not everything in this world
gets resolved with force.
- not everything has to be bang...
- i'm set.
- ...scream blood more blood. - baby
i got plenty. angel! we're okay.
she watches so much news...
that sometimes it gets
to be a little too much.
- you got a toilet? - yep.
- yeah just past the fridge.

did he just take the whisky
bottle to the bathroom?
do you want him to kill us all?
thanks for coming on in.

say goodbye to him?
- bye hancock. - hey all
right little buddy.
- are you okay?
- it was a joke.

he got it. she didn't get it.
i owe you. you gave me
my life back today.

to return the favour.

i'm in public relations.
you know what that is? of course
you do. we're image consultants.
we change the way people see products
companies people that stuff.
listen i see you on the news and
i see you out there today...
and it can't feel good that
people you know hate you.
- it's good to meet you ray.
- no i'm sorry.
but hear me out.
people... don't get me wrong they
should love you. they really should.
i wanna deliver that for you.
it's the least that i can do.
you know you're a superhero.
kids should ask you
for your autograph.
people should cheer
you on the streets.
what the hell are you
pricks looking at?
no no they're not...
it's all right.
they're not pricks
they're just people.
but i want you to give me
one short pitch you know?
that's all i ask. okay?
you use...
put it under here?
put it right there. perfect.
e-mail me or whatever. you
just fly on over i don't know.
i want you to think about it.
just be careful when you go.
sleep on it all right?
you get back to me?
i'll be right here. all right.
please don't stare you guys.
he's kind of one of us.
what about allheart?
it's a nonstarter babe you know?
i'm chasing windmills with that.
maybe i can't change the world but
i can change this guy's life.
- think about all the good he can do.
- i think you're wasting your time.
you really hate him.
hate? i don't hate him ray.
i don't even know the guy.
just look at the news. you
can see what he does.
i think he just needs
people to care you know?
you see the good
in everybody ray.
even sometimes when
it's not there.
i have a feeling about this.
don't work with this guy.
i know this kind of guy.
he breaks things.
my bad. everybody all right?
i'll go and get my mommy.
he is an asshole.
- what's your name boy?
- michel.
- you know who i am? - my
papa says you are an asshole.
well that's not really a nice
word to call a person is it?
- asshole?
- yeah.
because that could make
someone very angry...
and you know maybe
hurt their feelings.
you behave like an asshole.
all right...
do you know aaron?
well seems to be a
pretty good kid.
just wanna ask you to lay
off of him a little bit.
why asshole?
- you're gonna stop calling me that.
- asshole.
- that's not my name.
- asshole.
call me a asshole...
one more time.
asshole.
how about you thickness?
goggles?
hancock! you son of a
gun i knew you'd come.
ask mary. i had a feeling.
i said he heard me and
he's ready for a change.
this is great. did you do this?
you come in a little hot?
i'll meet you in the house.
- i know you don't drive but...
- oh damn it ray.
all right. you're all right. you're
all right. you're all right.
oh stop crying punk-ass.
go ahead.
- not okay. okay?
- he all right.
really not okay. this is some of
the stuff we're gonna work on.
how do you think that conversation's
gonna go down with his mom?
landing like that in the street's
also on the uncool side.
no that was already like
that when i got here ray.
i live here. i know
what the street's like.
we'll make those
problems of the past.
i'm gonna teach you how to
interface with the public.
- where's the wife? - mary
took aaron to his soccer game.
hancock pulled some
stuff up on youtube.
surprisingly large amount of not-great
stuff on you that's gonna be helpful.
what is this?
that's me trying to
change the world.
unfortunately not
doing real well.
come on. let's get to you.
this stuff was on youtube.
everybody loves a nutty buddy i
get it but this doesn't work sir.
hey give me a nutty buddy.
back up back up.
hey give me a nutty buddy.
back up back up.
mom! mom! mom!
those are children.
- we've been waiting a long time...
- get that camera out of my face..
you ever put out an
apartment fire ray?
- no i haven't done that. i'm in p.r.
- no. my ass was hot.
all right. how about this?
this is walter the grey whale.
everybody remembers him stuck
on the beach north of zuma.
along comes hancock.
hancock!
- i don't even remember that.
- yeah.
greenpeace does. walter does.
this gets redundant
after a while...
but my basic diagnosis of your
fundamental problem is...
- do you wanna hear it?
- no.
you're an asshole.
i know. i call it
like i see it though.
it's not a crime to be an asshole
but it's counterproductive.
but you are an asshole
don't you think?
be careful.
all right how about this? i've
been thinking about something.
this kind of goes to how
you present yourself.
come on. really? it's the middle of
the day. what springs to mind...
when you see this?
homo.
- what about that?
- homo in red.
- norwegian homo.
- i'll give you that.
let's move past the comics. let's
get into something a little deeper.
i think that deep down you behave
badly because you're lonely.
i think deep down you
want people's acceptance.
come on now. you save
people's lives...
and they reject you and
so you reject them back.
and it's a... and we're
gonna switch that cycle.
we're gonna start
fresh start anew.
this is outstanding. if you turn
some of this power into willpower...
- almost. - and then
he kicked it in.
hey hancock! we almost won.
yeah we did. okay upstairs.
i'm making lunch. go change.
hey sweetheart.
have you been watching the news?
- no we've been working on...
- interfacing with the public.
- this has been on all day.
- that's very good.
the law is the law mr. hancock
and you are not above it.
felony destruction
of property...
amounting to tens of millions
of dollars theft and now this.
from where i sit i see a
selfish self-absorbed man...
with a lot of muscle but no
regard for anyone but yourself.
mr. hancock let me remind you.
you are not above the law.
you have failed to show at over
anybody else would be held in
contempt. but oh no. not you.
you may be a superhero but
let me tell you this.
you're not nearly as strong
as the u.s. constitution.
bank on it buddy.
we do not condone the t...
genius.
things just got real. this
is exactly what we need.
there's a da trying to figure
out how to put you in jail.
- bitch can try.
- i say you go.
people take you for granted.
make people miss you.
- people don't like you hancock.
- i do.
two weeks you know? the public
will be clamouring for you.
when they do we'll be ready.
worst-case scenario is i'm wrong and
you just you know fly out of there.
what do you got to lose?
"i apologise to the
people of los angeles."
my behaviour has been improper
and i accept the consequences.
i ask my fellow angelenos...
for their patience
and understanding...
you're an asshole hancock!
asshole!
"life here can be
difficult for me."
after all i'm the
only one of my kind.
during my incarceration i
will be participating...
in alcohol-and
anger-management treatment...
you're a drunk bum!
"you deserve better from me. i can
be better. i will be better."
all right.
good morning ladies. welcome
to your new home...
it is the duty of each of you...
to remember your
inmate serial number..
turn to your right.
turn to your left.
okay scumbags. let's go.
give me the hand playboy.
i see you punk!
oh i get it.
i put some... most
of you in here.
yes you did.
i can understand you feeling
some kind of way about that.
what?
so i'm gonna do me and i'm
gonna let you do you.
i don't want no trouble.
all right?
i just wanna go to my cell.
- that ain't gonna happen.
- nope.
excuse me.
excuse me please.
deadly.
if you don't move your
head is going up his ass.
y'all fellas sure you
wanna ride this train?
choo choo asshole.
get him out! get him out!
did you shove a man's head
up another man's ass?
we're gonna... we're gonna
circle back to that.
the da's office wants your
sentence to run eight years.
it's a big number but not
something we didn't anticipate.
you know our plan is...
what are you doing?
hey hey hey!
it sounded like you said they want me
to spend eight years in this shithole.
eight is more like four and
a half with good behaviour.
but it's irrelevant because
with you out of the picture...
and with the crime rate going
up through the roof...
the da and the cops they're all gonna
call for your immediate release.
they're gonna demand it. where
are you going? sit down.
hey. hey. stop right there.
- stop it. hancock.
- move.
- hancock!
- get back!
you're being a coward!
- who you talking to?
- i'm talking to you.
- who are you talking to ray? - stop
pretending that you do not care.
you have a calling.
you're a hero hancock.
you're gonna be miserable the rest
of your life until you accept that.
trust me. trust this plan this
process. just stay in here.
when they call a hero's
what we're gonna give them.
how we gonna do that ray?
all right guys let's
start sharing.
- don? you had something?
- yeah.
yeah i think i might've had a
little bit of a breakthrough.
good for you.
yeah i mean i realised that
breaking necks is... it's easy.
but i'm sitting there and i'm
staring at myself in the mirror...
and i thought "this is
tough." - yeah it sounds tough.
why do you always laugh?
picturing you looking at the mirror.
it would scare the shit out of me.
every time i'm talking he
completely ruins the cycle.
now let's watch the crosstalk.
i'm not gonna share anymore
if he keeps doing that.
no no no.
- keep sharing.
- let's move on.
mr. hancock do you
wanna share today?
pass.
your landing is your first impression.
it's your superhero handshake.
don't come in too hot okay?
don't come in too boozy.

mercedes. all right?
people have to be happy
that you've arrived.

so you've used the door and
the building's still intact.
people are happy that you've
arrived. they feel safe.

"i see you don't wear a bulletproof
vest security officer."
i respect your courage...
"...because bullets don't bounce
off you they bounce off me."
this city is being run by
gangs and drug dealers.
hancock makes them
shake in their boots.

around it but he gets the job done.

of detonator-type deal.
there's 8 pounds of c-4 strapped
to each and every one of them.
this is a spring-loaded
dead man's switch.
if my thumb comes off it.
and now since we've had a
little change of plan...
between the police showing up and you
sucking out all of my associates...
i want you to break
into the vault.
you'll find three quarter-ton
pallets of small bills inside.
thirty million dollars.
and you're gonna
carry it for me.
you are gonna get me safely away
from here with the money...
or else they'll be cleaning
up these hostages with a mop.
i'm gonna have to
say no to that.
i'm really trying to
turn over a new leaf.
i will blow up this entire
building you asshole.
i really don't like that word.

first wife...
she died giving birth to aaron.
it's another dinner.
but... but...
so there i am i'm with this
beautiful little baby.
i don't know what
the hell to do.
and i was in the supermarket...
and i'm in the baby aisle...
and i've got a brand of
diapers in each hand.
i'm staring at them but i don't know
how i'm gonna get through the day.
an angel...
sees me.
she knew. she was...
she gave me this look.
and even in the trance i was in i
knew that somebody somewhere...
was throwing me a little rope.
you know?
starting that day you really put
my life back together. right?
- you're drunk.
- so? come here.
what about you buddy?
you're from another
planet aren't you?
no man i'm from miami.
you didn't come in on
like a meteor or...?
nope. woke up in a hospital
first thing i remember.
government hospital yes?
experimenting on you and...
no ray. regular old
miami emergency room.
- come on. - my skull
was fractured.
they told me i tried
to stop a mugging.
- somebody knocked you out. - i
guess i was a regular guy before...
and when i woke
up i was changed.
the hospital nurse tried to
put a needle in my arm...
and it just broke
against my skin.
and then my skull
healed in like an hour.
the doctors were astounded...
and they wanted
to know my story.
just like you. but i couldn't
tell them. i don't know who i am.
amnesia.
- you know the blow to the head.
- yeah well that's what they figured.
- you don't remember anything?
- no.
only thing i had in
my pocket was...
bubble-gum...
two movie tickets.
boris karloff frankenstein..
but no ld nothing.
i went to sign out the nurse
asked me for my john hancock.
i actually thought
that's who i was.
how come i didn't
hear any of this...
didn't read about it
in any newspapers?
it was probably in the
papers 80 years ago.
eighty years ago?
oh i don't age. this is it.
- that's nice. - gotta
wonder though.
what kind of bastard
must i have been...
that nobody was
there to claim me?
i mean i'm not the most
charming guy in the world...
so i've been told but...
nobody?
whoever it was they'd
be dead by now anyway.

okay? we're drawn to each other.
no matter how far i run
he's always there.
he finds me. it's physics.
are you saying that you two
are fated to be together?
i've lived for a
very long time ray.
and the one thing i learned...
fate doesn't decide everything.
people get to choose.
and you chose...
to let me think i
was here alone.
i didn't think you'd miss
what you didn't remember.
great. now what?
i didn't plan for this.

do you know if special ammunition
was used in the gun that shot him?
not that i'm aware of.

the better you're gonna feel.
you'll start getting
your powers back...
and be flying and
breaking things...
and saving people

we were built in pairs.
and when we get close to our
opposites we lose our power.

what happened to us?
summer of 4 b.c.
we were becoming
mortal like now.
they came after me with swords.
but you saved me.
they set our house on fire.
you pulled me out of the flames.
eighty years ago.
what happened then?
we were living in miami...
and a new movie was
playing in town.
frankenstein..
and after...
we walked down flagler street...
and you took my hand and
you held it so tight.
and they attacked
us in an alley.
they hit you so hard.
there was so much blood.
they wouldn't let me ride
in the ambulance with you.
and by the time i got to the
hospital you were awake.
but you didn't know me.
so i left.
every time we're together...
they come after you through me.
you're built to save people
more than the rest of us.
