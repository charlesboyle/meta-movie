- fuck!
- it's not there.
it's in the kitchen
where you left it.
how'd you get in?
you have a nice family.
they're fine. alive.
asleep.
- are you gonna kill me?
- if i was, i'd have done it
when you walked to the car this morning and
been gone by the time you hit the sidewalk.
- then why are you here?
- to talk.
but, mike, if you make me kill
you, you will not go alone.
sit.
are you a good man, inspector?
- i think.
- and yet you've killed men.
- yes.
- i'm gonna ask you a question.
how you answer it will
determine how this night ends.
how does a good man
decide when to kill?
the man you've been chasing
is a killer, a ghost.
rumour has it that he works for a
group known only as the organisation.
it's so secret no one
knows it exists.
it takes no sides, yet it has
ties to every government.
it's sole purpose is the training and
conditioning of professional killers.
these men are
selected at birth -
rejects, orphans.
all of them unwanted
and disposable.
they are made experts in every aspect of
combat and programmed for one purpose -
to kill.
the man you have been chasing for
the last three years, inspector,
is the very best of them.
put him there.
you shouldn't have
stolen from me, brother.
now you must pay.
where is the document?
- say it!
- i'm sorry...
- what happened to his voice?
- he made me swallow...
what did you do to his voice?
nothing, ovie. exactly
as he was delivered.
delivered?
- you didn't find him?
- no. a contractor. an american.
swallow what?
swallow what?
run!
we have all heard your
theories, inspector.
this isn't a theory.
this is our guy.
no motive, no forensic evidence, no
witnesses. he's... he's a ghost.
- how long have you chased this "ghost"?
- three years.
well, thank goodness you have interpol
to finance your persistence, huh?
despite being the anus
of the third world, we
are in attempt of competent
police work here,
and it is our belief that bwana
ovie was killed by his own brother.
oh, so he choked down a pound of
c4 and knocked on ovie's door?
probably.
general, this man truly is
the best at what he does.
he is likely responsible for
over one hundred deaths.
let me show you what i mean.
this is ovie.
and these are just the
ones we know about.
are you beginning
to get the picture?
they might kill you for that.
for what you're doing to that
whisky - brutalising it with ice.
never more than two cubes.
it waters down the scotch.
i'm sorry. aftermath of my
pretentious ex-husband, i'm afraid.
no.
i'm june. and you are?
this is where you
tell me your name.
excuse me.
africajob complete. the money has been
wired to your account. nice work.
regrettably, the next target date has
been moved up at the client's request.
and the client wishes
it to be public.
i've planned something more
subtle. i've made preparations.
incumbent russian president mikhail
belicoff's recent political shift
is in direct conflict with
our client's interests,
and threatens their control
of the russian government.
the client needs it to be public.
do you accept the new parameters?
yes.
we appreciate you
breaking normal protocol.
the specifics are
being uploaded.
i, for one, will not let
cowardice deter me.
mr belicoff? in light of
your political positions,
will the hardliners continue
to support your re-election?
one only needs to be...
we have a problem. there was
a witness in st petersburg.
- how reliable are your sources?
- impeccable, as always.
interpol has arranged the
pickup. will you intercept?
- yes.
- uploading data.
i can't be sure.
he never works again so quickly.
but the russians say
that belicoff was grazed
by a single bullet
from over 4km away.
but it definitely
sounds like him.
yes, sir.
well, what bothers me
is that he missed.
yes, sir. i know what this
investigation has cost. i...
i understand. i just
need a little more time.
sir, you need to see this.
sorry, sir. i'm gonna
have to call you back.
ok. he shoots the bodyguard to
get a clean shot at belicoff.
he splits these two civilians
by inches. keep watching.
keep an eye on the bodyguard.
see that?
back it up. back it up again.
an awful lot of arterial
spray for a miss.
sir. you have a call.
- whittier.
- they found belicoff's shooter.
- they found him?
- tip from a hotel concierge.
- concierge where?
- grand hotel. he recognised his picture.
a picture? where the hell
did they get a picture?
- i don't know, sir.
- all right. i'm on my way.
they found him.
contact the russian secret police,
tell them interpol has jurisdiction.
they are to keep him
under surveillance only.
no one moves until we get there.
no one!
was the target not
at the location?
the girl was there, but she was no
witness. she'd never seen me before.
we will be unable to transmit
payment for the belicoff assignment
as the task was not completed.
no. he took a direct hit through the
nasal cavity. i watched it myself.
please wait. uploading
live news feed.
so afraid of my message that cowardly
violence is their only response.
that was the scene outside...
who was the client?
answer me! who ordered
the hit on belicoff?
if you set me up, i will
find you and i will
burn that building to
the ground around you.
mike whittier, interpol. what's
the status of my suspect?
i was told you were coming, inspector. i am
captain gudnayev, st petersburg militsiya.
please make yourself
comfortable.
- my men are almost in position.
- for what?
we were informed the suspect
intends to flee. my orders are...
whoa, whoa. orders from who?
interpol has jurisdiction here.
militsiya's only responsible
for the extraction.
gudnayev is not directing
the operation, i am.
i'm chief agent yuri
marklov of the fsb.
the fsb? why the hell is the russian
secret police involved in this?
- sir, they're going in.
- get your men out.
- you have no idea who you're dealing with.
- these men are capable of handling this.
shoot on sight.
do not give that order!
<i>47</i>, it's diana. i could be retired
for contacting you directly.
the client was... belicoff.
your location has
been compromised.
come on.
stay here, cover the elevator. call me
on my cell and tell me where it stops.
yeah?
five dead in the lift.
none of them our boy.
he's on the third floor. he must've
opened the doors from inside the shaft.
freeze!
get down.
get down!
fuck!
sir!
we had him.
- how many men did you lose?
- 16 dead.
no! no, no! wait, wait, wait,
wait! don't touch that!
- where'd you get your fucking licence?
- i need the room, captain.
- where does he get all this stuff?
- can you make it work?
probably. why?
i've been looking
for you, inspector.
i think we started off
on the wrong foot.
who informed you of the
whereabouts of my guy?
i believe it's time we
had a chat, you and i.
jenkins.
yes, sir.
this assassin...
my associates tell me you
believe him to be freelance.
your associates tell you that?
you do not believe he is connected
with central intelligence agency?
- why do you ask?
- no reason. itjust seems a bit naive.
well, it's a theory.
yes, a theory. but a
theory shared by moscow.
in accordance with article
any state matters which deal
directly with intelligence
shall be the sole jurisdiction
of the host country.
ah, and the light bulb comes on. took
me a minute. must be the jet lag.
- you're telling me to fuck off?
- no, no, of course not.
you are a good man, michael.
one of interpol's best.
but leave this intelligence
work to the fsb.
and belicoff?
i'm sorry?
there's two things wrong with this photo.
one: the footage has been tampered with.
someone inserted that civilian to
cover up what actually happened.
- and the second thing?
- my boy doesn't miss.
delivery.
you're supposed to leave
this at the desk.
mr belicoff sent them.
make a sound, i'll end
your life. understand?
who else is inside?
i know you, from the
street earlier today.
- you're coming with me.
- i can't.
ok, ok! i'll get my coat.
- where are you taking me?
- somewhere safe.
- get in.
- fuck you! i'm not getting in there!
there's a dead man in there!
get me out of this car!
are you going to kill me?
i'm gonna ask you
some questions.
before today on the street,
have you ever seen me?
- why were you there?
- my boyfriend.
he told me to meet his
driver on the corner.
belicoff?
how, after i put a bullet
through his head, was
he able to give that
speech this afternoon?
then you're of no use to me.
wait! wait! there is something.
doubles. mikhail has doubles,
just like saddam hussein.
the man i shot was not an
impostor. belicoff is dead.
why'd you tattoo your face?
because it's the only place i
knew belicoff wouldn't hit.
tell me about udre belicoff.
mikhail's brother?
he runs slave girls,
drugs, weapons.
both the cia and fsb want him dead.
mikhail's been protecting him.
get up. get up. you're
coming with me.
i can't. he'll kill me if he
finds out i left the apartment.
belicoff hired me to kill
him, used you to set me up.
the dead man in the
trunk was your driver.
he was gonna use it on you.
you're as good as
dead without me.
where are you going?
i'm gonna finish the job i was hired
to do and find out who's behind this.
i need to talk to you.
i need coffee. follow me.
- we have three roadblocks.
- here, here, here.
we completely shut down
international airport.
all border security has been
tripled. he cannot get out of city.
- train stations?
- temporarily closed.
- and st petersburg station?
- no trains leave russia from this station.
only commuter trains
headed towards interior.
what makes you think he
go further into russia?
because i know him
better than anyone.
thanks for the coffee.
go to the last
platform and wait.
- why?
- now.
- jenkins, anything?
- nothing.
stay sharp.
i don't know, sir. it seems
odd for him to come here.
trust me. this is
where he'll be.
jenkins, bench. shaved head.
got him, boss.
fuck!
jenkins.
i'm still on him, boss.
platform... number nine.
boss?
you've gotten slow.
tell me why.
why is there a hit on me?
stay here.
how about dying with
a little dignity?
you think it's done?
it's just beginning.
i told you to wait.
i know.
i'm sorry.
i... i know...
freeze!
you're the one who's
been tracking me.
the russian militsiya have got
the terminal locked down.
you need a hostage, take me.
come on.
he hasn't seen your face.
he doesn't have to die.
take me instead.
please...
stop.
she saved your life.
he said your ribs are broken.
unlucky.
- you seem awfully calm, considering.
- your assassin is dead.
why are you covering this up?
you know that's not our killer.
i told you before, inspector.
this is no longer your affair.
now, there are two ways we may proceed.
one: my men accompany you to the hospital,
and when you and your associate can travel,
they will escort you to the airport.
then i will write a report
extolling interpol for it's help.
- medals will probably be involved.
- or?
i report your incompetence and disregard
for my nation's laws to your superiors.
this will find it's way to the
state prosecutor in moscow.
so how do you think we
should proceed, huh?
how about...
go fuck yourself.
- i was running out of oxygen!
- don't be dramatic.
- dramatic!
- i got rid of the body!
- i've been there for hours!
- i brought you breakfast.
i'd thank you if i
wasn't so mad at you.
look at me.
back at the station,
you interfered.
i'm sorry. i can't allow that.
- i swear i'll never...
- stop talking.
if you're looking for a reason not
to kill me, i don't really have one.
i'm not a whore by choice.
belicoff owns me.
i'm his property.
would you like to know how much
he paid for me? 300. american.
i've tried to escape.
the last time...
it is a strange thing
to wish to die.
so are you?
going to kill me?
no.
you don't want to fuck me and
you don't want to kill me.
i've never felt so much
indifference in my entire life.
if you ever again interfere
with me like that...
i won't.
- are we clear?
- yeah.
eat your sandwich. i
need to get some sleep.
- you know...
- nika?
yes?
stop talking or i'll put
you back in the trunk.
i gotta give it to you, sir.
pretty slick.
go fuck yourself.
it was a pretty stupid
idea, actually.
if we get caught, we'll be making snow
cones in siberia for the next 20 years.
yet here we sit...
belicoff?
shit! hide that thing.
we came to see chief agent yuri.
what's up?
he is very busy man. he asks you
to go directly to the airport.
we will escort you
there immediately.
ok.
it's for you.
after all these years, i'd
think you'd trust me.
tell me what you know.
officially, nothing.
unofficially, it appears your employer
is throwing you to the wolves.
- why?
- belicoff's softening political stance
and his refusal to cooperate with
hardliners upset a lot of people.
so they ordered the
hit and replaced him.
seems you and your friend are the only
ones who know belicoff is a double.
what's the cia's position?
company usually likes to be
on the side of whoever wins.
take the envelope from the girl.
ah, udre belicoff,
mikhail's younger brother.
- rumour is you'd like him to disappear.
- that is the rumour.
i'd like to help.
how's killing udre
belicoff gonna help you?
let me worry about that.
- what do you want for your trouble?
- small favour.
this is a small favour? i can't
do this, not in your time frame.
keep reading.
jesus christ. tell me it
isn't what i think it is.
ok. it's not what
you think it is.
but i'd expect the last thing you'd want
is for me to be arrested with that file.
ok. i'll try.
- thank you.
- yeah, you're welcome.
we know udre's been planning something
with a german arms dealer named price.
the two have never met.
that's your way in.
intercept price and you
get a shot at udre.
i'll get you his file. they're
meeting in istanbul in two days.
good morning. have
you slept at all?
some.
you know, you can sleep in
the bed. i won't bite you.
unless you pay me.
it's not polite to stare.
so when are you gonna
tell me your name?
- get dressed.
- what for?
we're going to dinner.
we need to buy you a new dress.
you're really quite charming
when you aren't killing people.
- this place looks nice.
- yeah.
don't you think?
wait here.
hey! what did you do?
eat without me?
- how did you know i wouldn't take off?
- i didn't. we have reservations at eight.
jenks, how do you feel?
my pride hurts worse than
my arm, sir. any word?
the sketch is out to all
interpol substations in
europe, stations, airports,
border crossings...
- what's that?
- this is what i wanted to show you.
it's every appearance belicoff has
made within the last 12 months.
this is from a speech he
made in london on may 7th.
and this is from some shitty political
luncheon in northern georgia.
someone took a photo
from a mobile phone.
look at the date.
may 7th. how is that possible?
i can't be sure, but unless he's figured
out how to be in two places at once...
- he has a double.
- he's paranoid enough.
- it explains the arterial spray.
- i hope he had health benefits.
when i was little i had this squirrel, you
know, with black stripes on the back?
- chipmunk.
- right, chipmunk. his name was tishka.
i'm sorry, sir, but this
is for another gentleman.
- table 26?
- that's right.
my mistake.
you know what table that is?
i saw the layout
when we came in.
- do you remember everything you see?
- no.
- what's the soup of the day?
- lentil with sautéed onions and tomatoes.
the woman behind you,
what's she wearing?
- with the red hair and the silk dress?
- yeah.
that's not a woman.
what colour underwear
am i wearing?
you're not wearing
any underwear.
come with us, sir. here we go.
it'll be all right...
nika, ask for the check.
- but i'm not done!
- then hurry.
you scratch what i said
about you being charming.
sorry, sir.
mr price.
thank you for the introduction
to udre belicoff.
little help, please.
- what the fuck?
- let's go.
what?
now.
well, that was lovely.
right up to the time you
dragged me out by my hair.
undress me.
so we are good with firearms. not
so good with ladies undergarments.
careful. i'm not
wearing any panties.
nika, you're drunk.
and?
and this is a very bad idea.
you mean this?
yes, that.
how about this?
definitely that.
then...
this must be really bad.
- the briefcase.
- mr price!
so you took it upon yourself to change
our appointment. how forward of you.
as i told your men, i was attacked earlier
by some lunatic. common sense dictated...
common sense should have dictated
you not abuse my good nature.
sit.
i was just going over a few of my
lines with some of your competitors.
lines.
my lines. you get it?
where was i?
he's not price.
this is the... the
kedr 9mm compact.
it's less than two kilograms, select
fire single or fully automatic.
empty... and safe.
or if you're looking for
an assault rifle, i have
the m203 with under-barrel
grenade launcher.
a lot of third world dictators
got a lot of 7.62s stockpiled.
saves them from
having to buy ammo.
everything here is available
in bulk, of course.
prices not negotiable.
any questions, mr price?
yeah.
what about the little one there?
here. i show you.
this is a makarov.22.
a favourite of the kgb.
particularly effective
in the right hands.
but for a real target, you
need to find a soft spot.
whoa, hold up. hey, wait.
this is not a kedr.
it's a chinese copy.
i don't know if it's the
drugs or you're usually
this inept, but you're
wrong about these guns.
if the gun you're holding
is as cheap as this
one, even if you could
shoot her in the eye,
and i'm not saying you could,
you wouldn't kill her.
- why are you doing this to me?
- i need you to help me with your brother.
mikhail? fine. fuck him!
i do whatever you want! what
the fuck do you want me to do?
just this.
it says here that when the male
penguin meets the female penguin,
he knows in the first ten seconds
whether he's gonna like her or not.
- are you listening?
- i'm listening.
i read that.
these articles are full of shit.
- why do you buy these magazines?
- for the advertisements.
what do you need
luggage like this for?
that perfectly holds my
sniper rifle and 245,
and a gag for irritating
talkative little girls
like you. you want me
to stop and get it out?
i don't know. you think we
have time for foreplay?
you know, when i was a little
girl, my father raised grapes.
and i told him that one day
i'd own my own vineyard.
it looks nice.
we need to get off the road.
jenks.
is that his suitcase?
how did we get that?
as a consolation prize,
captain gudnayev sent
me our boy's stuff from
the hotel in st pete
in case it might help.
- anything?
- not much.
there is... this.
what do you make of this?
"trust unto god and he shall
direct your path." it's...
that's psalms. i never figured
our boy as the religious type.
that's strange.
nika...
i have to go.
so much for happy endings.
i don't want you to do this.
belicoff needs to die.
i don't care about that.
not any more.
as long as he is alive, they
will never stop looking for you.
take this.
at the next station, get off the train as
soon as it stops. move with the crowd.
but i don't even know your name.
the place i was raised, they didn't
give us names. they gave us numbers.
mine was <i>47.</i>
well, that explains a lot.
- how will i find you?
- don't worry. i'll find you.
what are you going to do?
what i do.
you're drunk!
you don't want to drink with
your new president, <i>tovarishch</i>?
we are celebrating, yes?
all the evidence is erased.
mikhail belicoff.
and his pathetic brother udre.
now i'm the one and only, and the
one man i have asked you to kill -
the only one who can expose us -
is the one man not in this room!
so... tell me, <i>tovarishch,</i>
what exactly have you
done to find him?
it seems if we wait long
enough, he will find you.
us, <i>tovarishch</i> yuri.
he will find us.
the organisation has sent
in their best operatives.
i know. don't let your
incompetence hinder
them. we won't have this
conversation again.
belicoff's brother was
found dead in istanbul.
they're waiting for
the body in moscow.
- heads up.
- michael, how's things going?
belicoff's brother has been found murdered.
it's our guy. he's setting belicoff up.
we're getting pressure from the ministry
and the eu to drop this investigation.
- the russians will confirm...
- they're the ones leading the eu on this.
they deny your ghost exists
and filed papers with the minister's office
claiming you've overstepped your authority.
who did?
the fsb. specifically chief agent
yuri marklov. i need you to stop!
no, you don't understand. the
fsb is covering this up.
he killed belicoff's brother.
now, why? unless...
mikhail belicoff will attend funeral
services tomorrow morning...
the funeral. he's trying to take
belicoff at udre's funeral.
this generator produces
over 3,000 amps.
much more than is
necessary, but i wanted you
to understand the gravity
of the situation.
at 2:30, that radio taped
to your hand will activate.
you'll have 30 seconds to order the
shooting of your friend belicoff.
if you don't, the
generator will start.
your skin will melt, your
blood will vaporise.
there won't be enough
left of you to identify.
you have gone to a
great deal of trouble.
i am just a bureaucrat.
there is nothing i can
do for you, i'm afraid.
i disagree.
this is not a request.
this situation is fixed, and you
know both possible outcomes.
live or die. your choice.
here's something to keep
things in perspective.
i picked it up last night
when i was in your house.
- you bastard!
- if i were you, i'd keep that radio dry.
yell all you like.
the lord himself won't hear.
there are over 100 highly trained alpha
special forces soldiers in this cathedral.
it would be foolish to attempt any type of
violence. your assassin would realise this.
but what if he does?
look around you.
how much civilian
blood will be shed?
we are prepared for that as well.
gas canisters are being deployed.
if anything occurs, the civilians
will be rendered unconscious.
now, if you will excuse me...
one minute, 50 seconds.
my brother, he was a troubled man,
but he was not always like that.
one minute, 25 seconds.
one minute, 20 seconds.
should we choose to be kind and let
her die, much like my brother?
or should we do what is necessary,
what is hard, to save what we love?
one minute.
i, for one, will not fail
again, not with this country.
not with our children's future,
not with you - my countrymen.
hurry, come in!
change target! shoot belicoff!
do it!
just fucking do it now!
do not let the assassin escape.
release the gas.
lock down the doors. i suggest
you and your men follow me.
let's go!
your man has made a mistake.
there is no exit. he's trapped.
it doesn't make sense.
why would he?
"trust unto god..."
"and he shall direct your path."
shit. he set this up
from the beginning.
- where does this key fit?
- the archbishop's personal chambers.
the third tower over the moskva.
he's going into the
river, like in st pete.
jenks, get our men. let's go.
he is in the southwest tower.
call in the gun ships.
do not let him escape!
seems i underestimated you.
consistently.
a miscalculation on my part.
who are you?
- answer me.
- let me help you.
how? by having me killed?
ah, no. for that i'm sorry.
it was a mistake.
was nika a mistake? or did you
destroy her life for your amusement?
what? you think you can take what has
cost millions, years of planning,
for the good of this
country, and destroy that?
then what? walk away?
you don't think they
will let you do that?
if you kill me, they
will never let you go.
they will hunt you for
the rest of your life.
you did yourjob, and
you did it very well.
and for that, my boy,
you should be proud.
that's it?
yes. i'm offering
you your life back.
that is why you are here, yes?
that is what you want.
- no?
- no.
- interpol! drop your weapons!
- we have an arrest warrant for that man.
don't move! hands on your head!
on your head! on your knees!
don't do anything stupid.
just one thing.
knowing how this ends,
was it worth it?
killing belicoff?
knowing how this ends...
definitely.
what do you make of that?
hell.
- who the hell are you?
- agent smith, central intelligence agency.
- all you men, to the rear of that vehicle.
- you don't have jurisdiction!
we aren't here. which means when
we shred you with automatic fire,
then this will never
have happened.
we believe you're involved
in terrorist activities.
we're interpol. in
accordance with section 3...
we're transporting an
international criminal.
what criminal?
- oh, jesus christ!
- you know what? i'm sorry, man.
my mistake. i thought
you were someone else.
you prick!
on behalf of the us government, i'd like
to extend to you our sincerest apologies.
load up, boys.
- so now what?
- now you have to answer my question.
are you a good man, inspector?
- i think.
- and yet you've killed men.
so, inspector, how does a
good man decide when to kill?
if i think a man means
to do me or my family
harm, then i'll do whatever
i can to stop him.
but beyond that...
it's a crapshoot.
the key.
you knew i had jurisdiction and would walk
you right out through the front door.
i wanna be left alone.
- just like that?
- yeah. just like that.
this is the man you've
been looking for.
ballistics will confirm he
was shot by your weapon.
the magazine is in the
nightstand next to your bed.
don't forget it when you
call your superiors.
did you kill him here?
it's five. if you wait
till the girls go to
school, you won't have
to expose them to this.
explains why you waited
so long to call it in.
i can't go along with this.
i hope you can.
for both our sakes.
goodbye, michael.
i hope i never see you again.
i told you to leave her alone.
you should've listened.
