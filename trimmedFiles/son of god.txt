those who spoke out-

we got a new roman governor.
[ horse whinnies ]
pant/us p/yate.
ho!
[ man in distance]
what's going on?
[woman ] what are you doing?
- i can't lift it.
it's too heavy.

we need to be quick.

[ exhales sharply]
[ soldier]

it's a broken cart, sir.
well, what are you waiting for?

yeah, you're right.
give me a helping hand.
oh-
[ panting ]
what do you think

we're going fishing.
there are no fish out there

in fact, there are no fish

[john narrating ]
when jesus spoke to me,
<i>i fol/o wed.</i>
others joined us.
soon our numbers grew,
and all who heard him...
felt his power.
[child ]
no, no, it's my turn!
[chattering ]
- [ bleating ]
- [ man] ...put the lord
your god to the test.
you should untiringly...
keep the commandments
of the lord your god...
and his statutes,
which he has commanded you.
you shall do what is right
and what is good...
in sight of the lord.
[child ]
look! can you see him?
over there.
[chattering ]
so the lord commanded us
to observe all these statutes.
it's jesus!
no. god makes
the law.
[chattering ]
[chattering ]
this way, john.
keep everyone moving.
[chattering ]
oh, jesus.
[shouting ]
[ murmuring ]
[ murmuring continues]
how shall we picture
the kingdom of god?
it is like a mustard seed...
which a man took
and sowed in his field.
[ people murmuring ]
the smallest seed
in the world.
yet, when planted-
[ rafters creaking ]
[ grunts 1
it grows up-
rabbi.
[ crowd murmuring ]
[ boy ]
he's paralyzed.
your sins are forgiven,
my son.
[ ragged breathing ]
did you hear that?
he has forgiven his sins.
i thought only god
could do that.
isn't that blasphemy?
he knows.
it is blasphemy.
is that your wish,
my friend?
well, answer me.
tell me which is easier-
to say his sins are forgiven,
orsay...
get up and walk?
[ murmuring ]
[ ululating ]
[ ululating continues]
wait.
the son of man
has authority
to forgive sin.
[ crowd exclaiming ]
[ ululating ]
fﬂends!
what is this about?
not even moses himself
would have thought
he could forgive sin.
you heard
what our teacher said.
on what authority
does he think he can do this?
on his authority.
that is blasphemy.
only god can forgive sin.
and your friend...
could be stoned
for a false claim like this.
this is just the beginning.
let's go!
[crowd chattering ]
greetings, prefect.
welcome to judaea.
i hope your time here
will be prosperous...
and peaceful.
i intend to make sure it is.
from caesar.
disorder will not be tolerated.
[chattering ]
next.
[chattering ]
[ man ]
all taxes must
be paid in full!
- i'm not doing it.
- it's all i have.
[ clucking ]
get it out of here.
take it away.
no!
[ screams ]
[ thomas ]
they're all jews.
our own people
working for rome.
makes me sick.
collaborators.
let's move on.
[chattering ]
they're stinking vermin.
you should keep
your distance from them.
two men...
went to the temple to pray.
one a pharisee,
and the other one...
a tax collector.
the pharisee prayed,
“god, i thank you that
i'm not like other men-
thieves, adulterers...
or this tax collector.”
but the tax collector...
didn't even
look up to heaven.
he said,
- “god, have mercy on me.”
- have mercy on me.
i'm a sinner.
[whimpers ]
god blessed
the tax collector,
not the pharisee.
anyone who praises himself
will be humbled.
and anyone who humbles himself
will be praised.
matthew,
come.
see! now he even calls
the sinners to follow him!
one has to wonder
of the sins committed
by his other followers.
[ muttering ]
[ man ]
come.
come along.
tax collectors.
[ sighs ]
there's not a thread
of good in any of them.
[john]
thomas, jesus has not
come for the good,
but for the sinners.
[ mary magdalene ]
he gives people
a second chance.
we should too.
[jesus ]
blessed are the poor,
for theirs is
the kingdom of hea ven.
blessed are the meek,
for they shall
inherit the earth.
blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see god.
pray to him,
and he will listen.
and how should we pray?
like this.
our father,
who is in heaven,
hallowed be your name.
your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth
as it is in heaven.
give us this day
our daily bread,
and forgive us
our trespasses,
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
[ people shouting ]
no!
leave her alone!
[ man ]
stone her!
she's a whore!
- [woman ]
no!
- [ man ] here!
mother!
mother!
- please!
- adulteress!
come away.
[ peter]
mary, over here.
the law commands us
to stone such a woman.
what do you say?
[snifﬂes, crying 1
i'll give my stone...
to the first man
who tells me...
that he has never sinned.
[ snifﬂing ]
go...
and sin no more.
thank you. thank you.
[ pharisee ]
this cannot continue.
he ridicules our laws,
insults the traditions
of our fathers.
everything we've fought
so hard for-
our faith,
our communities,
everything
god has given.
you have heard it said,
“do not commit adultery.”
why don't you join us?
[ jesus ] but i tell you
that any man who even looks
at a woman with lust-
you're welcome, brother.
[jesus]
...has already
committed adultery.
why do you follow him?
he is leading us
to something greater.
open your eyes.
this is a dangerous man.
[ crowd murmuring ]
[ footsteps approaching ]
high priest,
nicodemus is here to see you.
[gates clatter]
- caiaphas.
- nicodemus.
i've had reports
of a young prophet,
a jesus of nazareth.
he has a big following
in galilee.
it's rumored
he'll come to jerusalem.
galilee?
he works miracles.
- they all do.
- [others laugh ]
nicodemus, don't worry.
nothing important
ever came from galilee.
[laughs]
a miracle worker
from galilee.
[laughs]
[children shouting ]
[shouting continues]
jesus!jesus!
looks like a quiet place.
rope. that's it.
take the rope.
lock it off.
rabbi, let me help you.
[ chuckles ]
[crowd chattering ]
[ man ]
it's jesus!
there he is!
[ clamoring ]
[ mary magdalene ]
they've come a long way.
they're hungry.
- give them food.
- but how?
we have nothing.
just a few fish
and some bread.
[cheering ]
bring them to me.
thank you, father,
for what you bring us.
our father in heaven
feeds the birds of the air.
how much more
will he give to you?
[crowd gasping ]
[ murmuring ]
[ laughing 1
[ murmuring ]
[jesus]
don't worry about daily needs.
god will provide.
put god first,
and everything else will follow.
[ people exclaim ]
if you hunger for righteousness,
you will be filled...
through me.
[john]
he said, “ask-
[ chuckles ]
and it will be given.”
[ cheering ]
[laughs]
[jesus]
john, we can feed them all.
[crowd exclaiming, shouting ]
from god.
it's from god!
[crowd chanting ]
messiah! messiah!
messiah!
messiah!
messiah! messiah!
messiah! messiah!
messiah! messiah! messiah!

they want you to be their king.
king of the jews!
you can lead us like an army.
we're strong enough
to beat the romans.
no. no, this is not the way.
not by force.
- messiah! messiah!
- [woman ] our king!
messiah! messiah!
[ mary magdalene ]
peter, where is he going?
what's wrong?
messiah!
now they shout “messiah.”
the people today-
they called you king.
they think
you are a messiah.
but you seem
to ignore them.
aren't you
going to be our king?
who do you think i am?
you are the son of god.
you can't have known this
by what you know of me, peter.
it has been revealed
to you by god.
you are peter,
and on this rock...
i will build my church.
tomorrow i will meet you
on the other shore.
[ wind whistling]
why did he walk away
just when we're getting strong?
surely a messiah
wouldn't leave us like this.
a messiah should be a-a warrior,
a conqueror like david.
judas,
force is not the way.
so tell me what the way
of the messiah is.
he's different.
[thomas] but, mary,
what if he's not the one?
we're risking our lives.
for what?
thomas!
he has shown us his power.
we must have faith in him.
[ peter]
he said he'd meet us
on the other side. let's go!
[ thunder rumbles ]
take the sail down!
tie everything down!
[ thunderclap]
this is too dangerous!
we should turn back
while we still can!
you heard what he said.
he wants us to cross.
what is that?
there!
[ gas-ps ]
[ thunder rumb/ing ]
it's a ghost.
[john]
no, thomas. it's jesus!
he is the messiah.
peter.

peter, what are you doing?
don't be afraid.
come.
[ thunder rumbles ]
peter!

you of little faith,
why did you doubt?
who do you think lam?

for the high priest!
[children shouting ]
papa! they're coming!
- [ people shouting ]
- malchus.
malchus!
malchus, what's happening?
it's another protest,
high priest.
we need to get you
out of here.
it's turning into a riot.
get the master
back to his residence
quick as you can.
[shouting in distance]
what is all this
about?
the aqueduct.
the people are furious
that the romans used
the temple funds to build it.
hundreds are heading
to complain to pilate.
what?
he'll have them cut down
before they can get
anywhere near him.
[shouting ]
- thieves!
- scum!
filthy roman scum!
just give it back!
[crowd quiets]
[ pilate]
jerusalem needs water.
you think
your god brings it?
no, he does not.
rome does.
it's time you understood
what your masters do for you.

to keep control.

martha, what's wrong?
my brother is dead.
show me the tomb.
[ martha]
he's been dead four days.

he will still have life.

my brother.
whoever believes in me...
shall never die.
believe in me,
and you will see
the glory of god.
[john narrating ]
i knew that word of such
a m/'rac/e would spread fast
no one could ignore it,
least of all the authorities.
caiaphas.
they say this jesus
has raised a man
from the dead.
what?
he- he could come here,
to jerusalem, for passover.
no.
but if he comes
with thousands
of supporters-
the city will already be
breaking at the seams
with those arriving for the festival.
nicodemus,
you are right.
the romans will step in.
we must not allow
this miracle man, this fraud,
to disrupt passover.
does pilate know?
hmm.
where's my wife?
it's late.
[woman sobbing ]
claudia, what?
e sobbing ]
i saw a man...
in a dream.
a man being beaten...
and killed.
an innocent man!
a holy man.
a good man.
help your lady
back to bed.
no!
it was a warning.
it was you who killed him.
[sobbing ]
[crowd clamoring ]
n [ humming ]
[ man ]
come on. quick. hurry.
mary! he's here.
who?
jesus!
he's back, at last.
lady, i believe your son is
the promised king of his people.
what is his name?

his name is jesus.
[ people clamoring ]

♪ amen n
[all ]
amen.
[ man ]
jesus will now
read from isaiah.
“the spirit of the lord...
is upon me,
because he has anointed me...
to preach good news
to the poor.
he has sent me...
to declare freedom
for the captives...
and recovery of sight
for the blind,
to set free
those who are oppressed.”
today,
this scripture...
is fulfilled.
[ people gasping ]
- [ people chattering ]
- what are you saying?
[chattering ]
what are you saying-
that you have achieved
all this?
that you are the messiah,
the chosen one?
sent by god? no!
i'm saying you must
accept god's word.
how dare you!
that is sacrilege!
he has never studied the law!
this man knows nothing!
his healing
is the work of demons.
it has begun.
he undermines our faith!
he recruits adulterers!
peter,
turn the other cheek.
you'll pay the price
for this.
like your friend
john the baptist.
you haven't heard, have you?
he was executed.
beheaded!
[crowd shouting ]
he was a good man.
[ jesus' voice ]
baptize me.
john was the greatest teacher
i ever knew.
he was more than a prophet.
our work goes on.
soon we go to jerusalem.
jerusalem.
it's too soon.
it's too dangerous!
we're not ready.
judas, why are we all here?
to take the easy path?
we must take the message
to jerusalem.
right to the heart of power.
[john narrating ]
we set out for jerusalem.
thousands were heading there
for the festival of passo ver.
[ chattering, laughing ]
the messiah! bring your palms.
messiah! messiah!
bring your palm leaves!
there he is! there he is!
hosanna!
[crowd cheering ]
this way. this way.
look at this.
messiah! hosanna!
messiah!
[crowd chanting ]
hosanna! hosanna!
where is he now?
he's just entered
the city.
on a donkey.
“see, your king comes to you,
righteous and victorious,
humble...
and riding on a donkey.”
where is he headed?
- towards the temple.
- [ grunts ]
he must not interfere
with passover.
god will bring his wrath
down upon all of us.
and... who knows
what pilate will do...
if the crowds
run out of control.
nicodemus,
go with malchus.
if he enters the temple,
watch him.
do not blink.
go.

get out of the way.
get back.
[woman ]
it's jesus.
[ man ]
he's going into the temple.
[chattering ]
[goats bleating ]
you exchange money here?
yes.
[ man ]
change your money here!
two and a five.
i give you one.
[ no audible dialogue ]

exchange here!
don't like the look of this.
jesus.
[w0
no! man]
jesus, please.
please.
is it not written-
wait.
is it not written-
“my house”-
“my house shall be called
a house of prayer”?
but you-
you have made it
a den of thieves.
[ nicodemus]
who are you
to tell us this?
we teach the law, not you.
you pray lofty prayers...
and love your shows
of piety in the temple.
hypocrites.
[crowd chattering,
murmuring ]
this is outrageous.
and you were
little help.
he's clever.
the crowd worship him.
there is something
unusual about him.
there is nothing
unusual about him,
apart from his ability
to cause havoc.
if he returns, challenge him.
make his supporters
see their messiah...
for the simpleminded peasant
that he is.
sir.
we're eating.
sir, a jew has been
causing trouble in the temple.
so?
he has a large number
of supporters.
what's his name?
they call him
jesus of nazareth.
my servants
talk about him.
he's caiaphas's business.
but you keep an eye
on the crowds.
if they start to get out of hand,
i'll shut the temple.
festival or no festival.
[john]
thank you very much.
[jesus chuckles]
you're very kind.
where's judas?
have you seen him?
no.
[ breathing heavily]
[judas ] i'm worried.
things are getting
out of control.
come to me
when you need... assistance.
[ birds calling ]
[chattering ]
alms for the poor.
oh, bless you.
[crowd chattering ]
[ man ]
be quiet. quiet.
it is much harder
for a rich person
to enter the kingdom of god...
than it is...
for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle.
the most important thing...
is that you should
love your neighbor...
as you love yourself.
[ nicodemus]
teacheﬂ
they say you are learned.
so tell us.
should we pay taxes
to the romans?
[ a
noll' 1
well, teacher,
should we...
pay the romans taxes...
or-
[ barabbas]
not pay!
kaii ]
day! not pay!
not pay!
[ chanting ]
israel! israel!
israel! israel!
tell him!
whose face is on the coin?
caesar's.
[ crowd murmuring ]
then give to caesar...
what is caesar's...
and give to god...
what is god's.
[shouting ]
[shouting continues]
high priest,
that man there with jesus,
he wants to help us.
really?
that could be useful.
[crowd shouting ]
israel! israel!
you let him get
the better of you.
yet i may have found
a way to deal with him.
[chattering ]
[crowd quiets]
do you see all these
great buildings?
not one stone
of this place-
not one stone
will be left standing.
[ giggling ]
[ man ]
did he say
he'd destroy the temple?
[ man #2 ]
what does he mean?
- he said what?
- not one stone
will be left standing.
he threatens
to destroy the temple.
we must move swiftly,
but softly.
we cannot arrest him openly,
or his supporters
will run riot.
no, not at passover, no!
no.
we must bring him in
quietly...
at night,
before passover.
malchus, what was the name
of that follower of his...
that you pointed out to me?
judas, high priest.
judas. yes.
bring him to me... here.
[ grunting ]
[ screams, groans ]
prefect, you're needed.
there's trouble.
roman scum!
roman thieves!
let's show them!
- roman thieves!
- [ man ] they're scum!
roman thieves!
roman scum!
since i've been prefect,
you jews have
tested my patience
to breaking point.
- now i'm beyond it.
- yes, but, prefect-
i'm speaking.
if the disturbances
that took place today
are repeated tomorrow,
i will shut the temple
immediately.
there will be
no passover.
i will put this city
under curfew.
i will crush
any rebellion.
do i make myself
absolutely clear?
[chattering ]
what are you preparing,
mary?
rabbi?
welcome.
i come here
of my own accord.
the high priest
knows nothing of this.
what's he doing here?
[ caiaphas ]
judas.
your friend from galilee
has caused quite a stir.
one cannot deny
that he has followers,
especially amongst
the less well-educated element.
but you, judas-
i'm intrigued.
he-
he has a power.
it's hard for me
to put into words.
a power to cause trouble,
to stir things up.
attacking money changers.
threatening
to destroy the temple-
the holy of holies.
if he were...
the son of god-
if.
would he abuse
the house of god?
the true messiah...
will unite israel,
not divide it.
what do you want
with him?
just to talk.
if the romans step in,
can you imagine the slaughter?
it will mean
the end of the temple,
the end of our faith,
the end of our nation.
is that what you want, judas?
judas,
you are his friend.
bring him here... discreetly.
let us try to stop this...
while we still can.
and what's in it for me?
good.
we shall expect to hear
from you presently.
they say you can
perform miracles,
that you have seen
the kingdom of god.
you can see
the kingdom of god.
but you must be born again.
born again?
how can you be... born again?
you must be reborn.
not in the ﬂesh,
but in a spirit.
[ wind rushing]
the wind blows
where it wishes.
you don't know
where it comes from...
or where it goes.
and so it is
when the spirit enters you.
god...
so loved the world...
that he gave
his one and only son.
believe in him,
and you will have eternal life.
malchus,
any word from judas?
nothing,
high priest.
i won't wait any longer.
we arrest this false prophet
tonight.
how do we know
he is a false prophet?
has he fulfilled...
any of the signs
of a true messiah
as written in our scriptures?
he will be tried
according to our law.
we remove this man,
or the romans
destroy everything.
remove?
yes, nicodemus.
the life of one peasant...
for the future of god's nation.

and condemned to death.

as you will it.
father, take this from me.

[caiaphas]

come on, mary.
quickly!
keep him moving.
[ men shouting ]
[ groans ]
- tell caiaphas we have jesus.
- [ soldier] yes, sir.
not you.
you cannot
go through with this.
it is not legal.
our scholars say
it must be in court,
in daylight, in public.
it is necessary.
why the rush?
you know why.
pilate will close the temple.
we must be rid of this jesus.
but what if he really is
who they say he is?
we are to decide
precisely that...
now, with god's guidance.
god demands
we obey the law.
let me remind you
what the law says.
anyone who shows contempt
for the judge
or for the priest...
shall be put to death.
anyone.
brothers.
thank you for coming
at this hour.
you know i would not
have asked you...
if it were not so serious.
[chains rattling ]
ah.
get him up.
[ caiaphas ]
jesus of nazareth,
you are charged
with blasphemy.
n [ people singing,
lndistinct ]
[ mary magdalene ]
mary?
[ sighs 1
mary.
what has happened?
where is my son?
jesus has been arrested.
arrested?
but we don't know
where they have taken him.
arrested?
at night?
they want
to keep it secret.
they don't want
any protests.
he has employed demons...
to heal.
he has threatened...
to destroy the temple
of our lord.
but, brothers,
we must listen...
before we judge.
and so i invite
the prophet...
to speak.
tell us the message
you bring from god.
nothing?
nothing to say?
surely-
tell us this.
are you... the chosen one?
are you the son of god?
i am.
and you will
see me coming...
with the clouds of heaven,
sitting
at the right hand of god.
this is repulsive!
with god? lmpostor!
fool! blasphemer!
we have heard enough.
there is only
one verdict.
guilty?
[ priest]
this is wrong.
this brings shame
on our council.
does it not?
[crowd chattering ]
let it be known
jesus of nazareth
has been tried...
by the supreme court
of elders.
and he has been found guilty
of blasphemy...
and of threatening
to destroy the temple.
the sentence...
is death.
[ crowd exclaiming ]
you! take back your money!
you.
i've seen you before.
you know him.
no.
i don't know him.
you called him rabbi.
he has nothing to do
with me.
[woman ]
you know him.
i've seen you with him.
i don't know him.
[ grunts, groans ]
[jesus ]
peter,
you w/7/ deny me
three times.
[ crying ]
don 'z' be afraid.
[ malchus]
take him to pilate.
[ cock crowing ]
sir, the high priest caiaphas
and his elders are here
to see you.
[ sighs ]
[ caiaphas ]
prefect, good morning.
prefect,
we need your help.
we have convicted
a dangerous criminal.
so? execute him.
we cannot.
this is a tense time...
when my people
celebrate...
their deliverance
from past oppressors.
he claims to be our king...
and is whipping up
the crowds into a rebellion,
a rebellion that could
tear jerusalem apart.
caesar would not
be pleased.
his name.
jesus of nazareth.
you better not
be wasting my time.
i'll see the prisoner.
[ chains jangling ]
so,
tell me who you are.
are you the king
of the jews?
are you asking,
or is it a question
coming from others?
are you a king?
that's what your own people
and chief priest...
tell me you claim to be.
my kingdom...
is not of this world.
if it were,
my servants would
fight my arrest.
my kingdom
is from another place.
[water splashing ]
you are a king then.
you say
that i am a king.
i have been born...
and come into the world...
to testify to the truth.
everyone
on the side of truth...
listens to me.
truth?
what is truth?
[ door slams ]
that's him.
the man i saw in the dream.
that's him!
they want him
executed.
you can't.
they say he could start
a revolution.
you mustn't!
if i don't, caiaphas will blame
any rebellion on me.
caesar will see it
as my failure.
he's warned me once.
he's not going to warn me again.
i'll be finished.
we'// be finished.
he's guilty of nothing more
than being deluded.
he has broken the law.
your law, not caesar's.
prefect,
we cannot be held
responsible...
for what the people
may do today...
with their eyes on god...
if you release a man...
who has broken
our sacred laws.
the people?
caesar decrees...
i can release a prisoner
at passover.
let the people decide
which of the prisoners i hold...
will be executed.
get him out
and teach him some respect.
forty lashes.
[john]
peter.
peter! what's happened?
where's jesus?
peter.
peter, where's my son?
they've condemned him.
peter, stop.
where are you going?
i denied him.

the king of the jews.”
he was never our king.
it must read,
“this man said...
'i am the king
of the jews.”'
