open range
think she'll get over thisaway?
might.
best bed them down.
come on, tig.
there she goes.
looks like we're in for it.
you see them?
can't see them.
can't hear them.
you ever seen one this bad?
not since noah and the flood.
well, you should know, boss,
since you was there.
what did you say?
he said, "you should know
since you was there. "
well, even that
wasn't this damn wet.
one thing's certain.
noah never shoveled as much bull
from them he had aboard.
let's rustle up some grub.
mose?
hey!
- that hurt?
- yeah.
mose, still got them cards?
yeah, i got them.
get them out, and let's have us
a game after breakfast.
button!
pull them plates under here.
you gonna play them cards, mose,
or stare a hole through them?
don't rush me.
i'll take four.
oh, for pity's sakes.
"take four. "
all right, that's it.
i'm out.
me too.
a man's trust
is a valuable thing, button.
you don't want to lose it
for a handful of cards.
well, at least it ain't raining.
get yourself dressed, button.
help mose get things cleaned up.
then you walk out
and look for them horses.
looks like you could use
a little muscle there, charley.
you just keep on like you are.
you'll get your chance
soon enough.
no need to ask
for more chores, mose.
every man's got to pull
his weight.
yeah, but my weight
is half of yours.
you know, it's hard to figure
charley sometimes.
i ain't even sure
if he likes me.
he likes you.
you know, boss had some pause
about hiring me on.
too big to get around on horses
and work them cows.
afraid i'd eat too much.
it was charley
that talked him into it,
and i ain't one to take
a man's confidence lightly.
you know i ain't, either.
i know you ain't, but it's best
to keep remembering it
if you want respect
when you're riding with men
like charley and boss.
button, pull.
pull it.
button!
button!
quit playing with that dog
and pull the wagon!
pull it!
- pull!
- oh, yeah!
yeah.
that's it.
hey, hey!
look at that!
old boss sure can cowboy,
can't he?
yeah.
broke the mold after him.
main bunch is working
towards water.
we'll go up-country,
find the rest,
and we'll push them there.
look at that.
a couple of damn kids.
anyway, once we get them,
we can start driving them back
closer to camp.
it'll be a while
before we see another town.
could use supplies,
coffee and such.
mose!
ow!
mose!
you'll have to ride back
to that town we passed.
when you want me to go?
tonight.
i'll go.
i can go.
how long you figure, charley?
without cows slowing things,
maybe one day there, one back.
sounds about right.
come on, boss.
i can do it.
sure you can, boy.
just don't know
if that town's ready
to have you
turned loose on it just yet.
english!
damn! shit!
bullshit!
by god, if you're gonna pick
your feet like a monkey,
you do it downwind.
swear to god, old tig
takes better care of herself.
starting to think
it was a mistake
not getting you on in some town
to learn a trade.
i don't like towns.
never liked them.
oh, you're just saying that
'cause you heard me say it.
get yourself a trade
and set up in a town.
you'll always have
a roof over your head,
a bed up off the ground,
and food no further away
than a café.
ain't that so, charley?
that was a big help.
might as well be talking
to this horse.
put your boot on, button.
let's go to work.
course, if you was to live
in a town...
you'd have to clean up some.
otherwise, no one
could stand the stink.
what you do that for?!
cheating at cards.
cheating.
i apologized to you for that!
eh, boss?
i apologized to him for that.
evidently he ain't over it yet.
it's getting dark, boss.
he could have got hurt
between that town and the camp.
probably just taking his time.
don't suppose he got into
a poker game, do you?
wouldn't gamble
your money, boss.
what if he's lying out there
waiting for us to come along?
we'd never find him tonight.
now, come on down from there.
he's worried.
- you worried?
- yeah, i'm worried.
been worried since yesterday.
should have sent me.
mose can look out for himself.
then why ain't he here with us?
well, you never was
wanting to go to towns.
well, i don't want to go now
neither.
but we better find him,
wherever he is.
all right.
you and me strike out early.
button can watch the outfit.
button, come on down from there
and get supper a-working.
most likely be back
before suppertime.
but three sets of eyes,
it's better than two.
- you stay with the wagon.
- come on, boss.
no one is gonna bother it.
we haven't seen a single person
since we set up the camp.
i always feel better
if someone's close around.
you been working hard,
deserve a little loafing time.
stay right here.
stay, tig.
wants to go.
she acts like she does,
but she don't.
still got the heart,
not the legs.
you keep that rifle close.
always liked me a sidearm
with some heft.
took this off a man who couldn't
pay all he owed for some cows.
damn fine weapon.
always noticed you favor
something light, don't you?
set it right down.
thank you.
hello!
- howdy.
- howdy.
like to feed and water them,
curry them down with saddles on.
okay, that'll be four bits each.
- there you go.
- thank you.
not planning on staying long?
long as it takes to find
who we're looking for.
maybe i can help you gents.
i been here since harmonville
was fort harmon
and we still had soldiers
to chase off indians.
i know everybody in town
and for miles beyond.
big man needing a haircut,
about 30.
that's his rig right there.
oh, yeah.
know who you're talking about.
very friendly young fella.
looks like he's been living out
of saddlebags most of his life.
got his horse in the corral.
ride with you, does he?
know where we can find him?
yeah.
yeah, he's up in the jailhouse.
he got into it
with some cattlemen
over at the general store.
- some cattlemen.
- yeah.
busted them up pretty bad, too,
before marshal poole came up
and hit him over the head
with his gun barrel.
yeah, he's lucky he
didn't get shot in the back.
you might want to keep that
in mind
when you're talking
to marshal poole.
saddle his horse.
that cover what he owes?
oh, yeah.
name's percy if you should need
anything else.
much obliged.
hold on.
how long you had him here?
i brought him in here
yesterday afternoon.
it wasn't easy
getting him into the cell.
why is that?
goddamn bear.
size of it.
evening.
name's boss spearman.
this here's charley waite.
evening.
believe you have
a friend of ours.
name's mose harrison.
yeah, i got him here.
he started a fight
in the general store.
mose don't start fights,
just finishes them.
i just said he started it.
you said he didn't.
maybe you're calling me a liar.
you got a charge against him?
i got plenty.
inciting a fight.
disturbing the peace.
creating a public nuisance.
take your pick.
hear tell he got hit
over the head.
he'll be fine.
well, i come to get him.
well, you pay the fines,
and you can have him.
how does $50 each offense sound?
like robbery.
lot of money.
oh, yes, a lot of money.
i been waiting for you,
mr. spearman.
my name's denton baxter.
be your men mose tussled with.
that's right.
you know, folks
in fort harmon country
don't take to free grazers
or free grazing.
they hate them more than they
used to hate the indians.
i expect by "folks,"
you mean ranchers like yourself.
i got the biggest spread around.
bigger than any three or four
put together.
built it up with me own
two hands,
piece by piece,
along with this town.
and there ain't no
free-graze cattle
gonna take the feed
off my cattle on this range.
free graze is legal.
times change, mr. spearman.
most folks change with them.
a few holdouts never do.
you know, a few years back,
a free-graze outfit
came through.
one night,
the cattle got stampeded,
the wagons caught on fire,
and one of those boys
was shot off his horse
in the middle of it all.
shot in the back, was he?
your man's horse and rig
are at the livery barn.
you can take him with you
when you leave tonight.
and come sunrise,
you hitch up your wagon
and get your damn
free-graze cattle moving
and keep them moving till you're
out of fort harmon country!
now, you let mr. spearman
fetch his man
so he can be on his way.
charley.
- mose.
mose.
looks like someone's put the
boots to him after he was down.
does it?
mose, you gotta get up.
charley, i'm glad to see you.
i don't much like this town.
here you go.
boy, they really lit into him.
you got a doctor in this town?
yeah.
doc barlow.
it's the house up behind
the barn by the church.
look for a picket fence.
he's got a sign out front.
oh, my.
bring him right in.
lay him down in there.
i'll fetch the doctor.
get his legs, boss.
easy, easy.
good.
i'm dr. barlow.
boss spearman.
charley waite.
patient there's mose harrison.
he works for me.
these wounds are old.
easier to treat
if you bring him in right away.
your marshal had him, and he
don't keep a friendly jail.
this is the man who was in the
fight with dent baxter's men?
he certainly gave
as good as he got.
broke the arm of one.
knowing them,
they had it coming, i expect.
let's see what we got here.
- aah!
- easy.
- easy, mose.
- easy, mr. harrison.
nobody's trying to hurt you
on purpose.
i'd say you got a couple
of broken ribs.
gonna need to get
this shirt off.
sue, i am gonna need some soap,
some water, and some alcohol.
i want you to drink this,
mr. harrison.
- that's it.
let's clean up these cuts
on his face.
he's got a nice gash
in his scalp there.
i'd say to good health,
but then i'd probably be out
of business.
we'll drink to good health
for them that have it coming.
the two of you
can wait in the parlor.
be better he didn't travel.
well, he'll have to.
how much i owe you, doctor?
we're even.
i figured i made enough off the
damage he did to baxter's men.
wish he'd have made you wealthy.
ma'am.
doc barlow's got him
a pretty wife.
notice that, did you?
well, i ain't dead.
glad to hear it.
sweet, too.
treated us as good as anybody.
that's a real lady.
a woman like that makes a man
think about
setting down roots, eh?
doc looks like a real
hardworking feller.
probably working away on making
some little ones, too.
creates quite a picture,
now, don't it?
yeah.
heard they're worth
a thousand words.
hey, tig.
now, where do you suppose he is?
goddamn kid.
button's all right, boss.
anyone done him harm, they'd
have gone through the wagon.
reckon you're right.
here he is.
if you're awake,
you might want to see this.
- where you been?!
- i seen it before.
out with the herd.
i thought i told you
to stay with the wagon.
- what happened to mose?
- did you hear what i said?!
yeah, but what happened?
run into a little trouble
in that town.
looks like more than a little.
are we moving on?
we always do, don't we,
once we've grazed off a place?
did i do something wrong?
just leave him be for a while.
here.
have some coffee.
made fresh, for a change.
there was three riders scouting
up the herd this morning.
where?
maybe half a mile out.
just sitting there,
looking at the cattle.
same ones?
four this time.
country's filling up.
maybe we should push on.
do no good, button.
i seen them like baxter before.
he means to have this herd
or scatter it to the wind.
if he was gonna take the herd,
why not just keep you in town?
marshal already had mose.
wants us all in one place.
far from there when it happens.
don't make no sense, him telling
us to move on and all.
weren't the only thing he said.
most time, a man will tell you
his bad intentions
if you listen,
let yourself hear.
a few years back, a free-graze
outfit come through.
that weren't no idle story.
let's find out for certain.
beautiful country.
a man can get lost out here,
forget there's people and things
that ain't so simple as this.
how long we been
riding together, charley?
nigh on 10 years.
mm-hmm.
you know what they call that,
call it a decade.
long time.
been a lot of change since then.
what's on your mind, boss?
way i figure it, we can leave
the cattle and run,
or you and me can go in the dark
and stop them
before they scatter the herd.
you reckon them cows are worth
getting killed over?
the cows is one thing.
but one man telling another
where he can go in this
country's something else.
that rancher sat
in that jailhouse,
sneering and letting
his lawman lay down the law
till he figured
it was time to show us
that he gave the orders
around here.
ooh, sticks in my craw.
well, we sure as hell owe them
for what they done to mose.
yeah.
i'll saddle the horses.
you two keep a sharp eye out.
got the scatter-gun.
we'll be watching for them.
you'll want to douse that fire.
button, keep to the wagon.
i don't want to see you
out in the open.
okay?
i got some sugar in that town.
it's in the wagon.
i wouldn't want to have him
coming down on me
like these cowboys.
what the hell's the matter
with you, gus?
you're twitching all damn night.
damn back's so sore from being
flung into that stove.
feel like i been humped
by a 300-pound whore.
well, gus, i'd say
you got off easy.
look at my face.
well, you can bet butler will
square things with that big man
for breaking his arm and all.
did you hear it snap?
i heard it snap.
lucky for him he shoots
with either hand.
one twitch, and you're in hell!
now, get on your feet,
all of you!
now, throw them guns
on the ground.
i ain't a-gonna say it again.
and kick them away.
which one of you's got
a sore back?
which one?
him.
- you're gus?
- yeah.
ought not gang up on a man
three-to-one.
ohh!
wait a minute, mister.
- it wasn't our idea to jump him.
- shut up, wylie.
get up, you son of a bitch.
- what's your name?
- vince.
mighty nice tie-down you got.
you're a gunhand, are you?
- you fast?
- no.
uh-huh.
how many riders does he have?
i said, how many riders?
the rest are on their way
to your wagon.
uhh! aah!
you want to smile now, go ahead.
be a while before he's of use.
charley, throw me
them saddlebags.
put your spook hats on.
the ones in your belt,
put them on.
now get your britches off.
not taking my britches off
for nobody.
you listen out
of your good ear now.
now, get them off!
pretty scary bunch, eh, charley?
get belly-down, flat-out!
uhh!
get your peckers in the dirt.
- hyah! hah!
hah!
if i hear so much
as a twig break...
i'll come back
and kill you all.
charley.
charley!
no tig come to meet us.
ooh.
the bastards.
they shot the boy,
but he's alive.
is that mose?
he's dead.
shot him in the head.
charley?
charley?
charley, get the lantern
and the whiskey.
yeah.
come on, wake up.
charley.
they shot him here and
cracked him in the head here.
we'll have to dig
that bullet out.
you done good, boss.
him going in and out like that.
i don't know.
he lost a lot of blood.
a whack on the head
can make a man strange
for the rest of his days.
well, you done all you can.
he needs a doctor now.
if button lives through morning,
you take him in the wagon
and move on.
you just gonna sit out here
waiting with them cows?
that's right.
and i'm gonna kill
every son of a bitch
that comes to take them.
for one man on open ground,
you sure got a lot
of killing in mind.
you know i never
gone against you, boss.
always let you do
most of the talking.
but he needs that doctor
back in that town,
and i aim to take him.
if you want to come,
we'll go together.
otherwise, you do what you
have to do, i'll do the same.
you think they'll let you waltz
in there and waltz out?
i don't figure into it.
button deserves every chance
we can give him.
all right.
but i aim to kill baxter
and those that done this.
and if that marshal gets in the
way, i'm gonna kill him, too.
so you best get your mind right
about what's got to be done.
i got no problem
with killing, boss.
never have.
looks real nice, charley.
yeah, a man ought to have
something to show he was here.
be gone in another big storm.
don't matter none.
he's got your dog for company.
he'd like it you put
old tig with him.
yeah, he was more
mose's dog in the end
than he was mine.
be right to say some words.
you want to speak
with the man upstairs, do it.
i'll stand right here
and listen,
but i ain't talking
to that son of a bitch.
and i'll be holding a grudge
for him letting this befall
a sweet kid like mose.
well, he sure as hell
wasn't one to complain.
woke with a smile.
seemed like he could keep it
there all day.
kind of man that'd say
"good morning" and mean it,
whether it was or not.
to tell you the truth, lord,
if there was two gentler souls,
i never seen them.
seemed like old tig wouldn't
even kill birds in the end.
well, you got yourself
a good man and a good dog,
and i'm inclined to agree
with boss
about holding a grudge
against you for it.
i guess that means "amen. "
god.
charley, you all right?
i'm fine.
seems like you was, you know...
i said i'm fine.
just got some old feelings
coming up.
you know, we never asked
each other much.
that's always been okay with me.
i figured it was okay with you.
but you said some things
the last couple of days.
things that seemed like they had
kind of a history to them.
hey, charley?
don't stand behind me, boss.
when i was a kid, a bunch of us
would go into the woods
with our peashooters.
nothing fancy, just enough
to kill a bird or a squirrel,
maybe something larger
if we was lucky.
killed my first man
in them woods.
held the paper on our farm,
and after my pa died,
he'd come around to get payment
from my mom in any way he could.
weren't much older than button
when i shot him in the throat.
knew there'd be more killing, so
i run off and joined the army.
war was on.
they was only too happy
to have me.
my first skirmish was like
hunting with my friends.
we just sat up in some trees,
and they came marching at us.
must have been a hundred of them
dead after the smoke cleared.
went around and shot the rest
who weren't.
those of us with the knack
was made into a special squad
so we could travel light
and on our own
into enemy territory.
orders were pretty simple.
make trouble wherever we could.
with room like that, it wasn't
long before we was killing men
that weren't even in uniform.
seemed like that went on
the rest of the war.
after that, i come west.
lot of call for a man
with them skills.
and i put them to work
for men just like baxter.
every once in a while,
i almost get through a day
without thinking
about who i am, what i'd done.
he drifted off again.
no better, but no worse, either.
you're a real honest man,
charley.
well, i ain't gonna lie
about button.
not button i'm talking about.
- mr. spearman.
- the doctor in?
no, he's not here.
we got a boy that's hurt bad.
here, put him
in the examining room.
it's not his hearing, ma'am.
he hears real well
when he's awake.
mr. spearman, i'm checking
if there's blood in his ears.
it could mean a fractured skull.
are you the boy's father?
no, ma'am.
his name's button,
and he works for me.
it appears that's
not very healthy.
you know the way to the parlor.
sit down.
i'll be a while.
well, i don't think
it's a fracture.
concussion's more likely,
but it's bad.
i have to admit, we don't see
a lot of people shot.
i cleaned and dressed the wound.
doesn't look infected.
what about the fever?
he needs to lay still
and let his body do its work.
no offense, ma'am,
but we come a long way
to see that the boy gets looked
after proper by dr. barlow.
now, where's he at?
one of dent baxter's hands
came and fetched him
out to the ranch.
some men there had an accident
night before last.
you must tell me what happened,
mr. spearman.
baxter sent his men
to stampede the herd,
and i figured me and charley
to stop them.
surprised them where they was
hiding, and we had at them.
them's the one dr. barlow's
putting back together.
we got back to camp, others
had shot mose in the head,
shot button, left him for dead.
oh.
shot our dog.
i'll be getting money.
it's not necessary.
we pay our way, ma'am.
please, sit, mr. waite.
button.
is that his real name?
please, sit.
yeah, it's the only one
we've known.
he's just a boy.
yeah.
picked him up in a texas town
a few years back,
living off café garbage.
couldn't speak a word
of english.
thought we was doing him
a favor.
what about you?
hmm?
you know that the marshal
works for baxter.
people saw you ride in.
there's payment to be made
by them that done this.
don't intend to run.
we could wire
for the federal marshal.
if he started riding today,
he wouldn't make it for a week.
with the storm coming,
maybe longer.
we're obliged to deal with the
marshal and baxter ourselves.
what about button?
well, he's fighting
for his life.
we're gonna do the same.
whatever's needed for button,
you do it.
if he wakes, he's gonna need
to stay here a couple days
so we can watch him.
whatever's best for him.
can't stay away from
my little paradise, gents?!
believe satan says the same at
the gates of hell, old-timer!
we'd like to put the horses up.
had a tough trail.
i'd like to set
the wagon yonder.
help yourself!
hurry up, though!
i seen it like this before!
big one's coming!
hyah, hyah, hyah!
son of a bitch.
sorry, charley.
yeah.
jesus christ.
ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo!
maybe you should have built it
in another spot.
ah, mercy.
get the dog!
get the dog!
get the dog!
it's a dog there, charley.
take this.
there he is.
back here, charley!
to your left!
to your left!
get him!
get him!
you all right, charley?
yeah, considering
i've just been swimming.
i owe you, mister.
that's a sweet pup
you got there.
remind you of anyone, charley?
small version.
too small to be let out
in this weather.
belongs to my daughter.
i tried to grab him, but
the water was too fast for me.
if you're going into the café,
i'd be proud to buy you both
a cup of coffee.
coffee would be good about now.
this is like the storm
that washed away gunnison
the water come down
from the mountains.
nowhere to go
but straight into town.
- killed a lot of folks.
- it's okay, bill.
town's been here
a long time, mack.
it'll be here a lot longer.
that's right, papa.
every once in a while,
a good storm washes through
and leaves her as clean
as a baby's bottom.
got to look
on the bright side, gents.
marshal.
meat and spuds, les, as always.
that should cover our meal.
worth a man's life to walk
across that road tonight.
thanks for the coffee.
well, appreciate what you done.
that'll be two bits.
two bits.
i'll be having words
with you two.
and we'll be having more
than that with you, marshal.
no need to make
the café messy... with folks.
i've got a warrant sworn out
for your arrest
for assaulting baxter's men.
we got a warrant sworn
for attempted murder
for them that tried
to kill the boy
who's laying over there
at the doc's.
swore out another one
for them that murdered the big
fellow you had in your cell.
only ours ain't writ
by no tin star
bought and paid for, marshal.
it's writ by us.
and we aim to enforce it.
is that so?
we got no quarrel
with none of you folks.
baxter's men bushwhacked
our friend and shot him dead.
shot a 16-year-old boy, too.
and clubbed him so hard...
he might not live.
tried to take our cattle.
your marshal here ain't gonna do
nothing about it.
you don't like free grazers
in this town.
we don't much like being here.
but a man's got a right
to protect his property
and his life.
and we ain't letting no rancher
or his lawman take either.
we got no intention
of harming bystanders.
anyone who helps or comforts
these goddamn lawbreaking
free grazers
is gonna have to deal with me.
your call, marshal.
we don't have to settle this
here and now.
you ain't going nowhere
in this weather.
but i'll be seeing you gents
real soon.
you can count on that.
that marshal ain't gonna wait.
that son of a bitch is gonna get
some men, come looking for us.
he's gonna need us locked up
tight in that jail
by the time baxter hits town,
'cause if we ain't,
baxter's gonna start to think
that maybe marshal poole ain't
worth what he's paying him.
you got something on your mind,
just spit it out.
well, i say we take him
right at the jail.
lock him up, wait for baxter
to come riding in.
hell, charley, why don't we
just ride out to baxter's ranch
and go straight at him, too?
well, i'll fight
wherever you want, boss.
you just make the call.
god damn it.
now, hold on, charley.
hold on.
well, you asked me.
i told you.
charley, come on in
out of the rain, would you?
come on.
come on.
just getting testy
in my old age.
sounds like it's not
such a bad idea.
just roll it around
is all i ask.
all right.
what'd you think of my speech
in there?
liked it.
maybe i ought to run
for mayor.
well, i believe officeholders
got to be living, boss.
come to see about the boy.
he's asleep.
but, please, come in.
are you sure, ma'am?
we're a mite rank.
we don't want to mess
your house.
no, no.
no, please, it's all right.
come on in.
thank you, ma'am.
there you are.
i can't get my fingers in.
we can't get our big fat fingers
in these holes.
- too many broke knuckles.
oh, let me get you
something bigger.
- no, ma'am, we can make do.
- no, no. it's all right.
it's just nice to be sitting
at a table set with fine china.
those were my mother's.
they were the only things
of hers
that survived the trip
out here.
i don't know why
i bring them out.
i can't hold them, either.
guess it just makes me
feel good.
i say what's
on my mind, good or bad.
i admire that.
try living with it.
see that?
no need for a wife or home.
we're just like a...
an old married couple.
so, is it marriage
that scares you two
- or putting down roots?
- no. who'd have him?
all rangy and mangy
like a rough old dog.
how about i hold
your head underwater
for just a little while?
i married once.
never knowed that,
did you, charley?
had a wife and child.
sweet little spread, too.
it was nothing fancy,
but we was young.
loved each other.
never had a cross word.
they caught the typhus
and died.
and after that, home didn't seem
a place to spend time.
believe i've changed
my mind on that
now that i'm getting on
in years.
if button lives
and we survive baxter,
i swear i aim to see to it
there's a home he's sleeping in
instead of the cold prairie.
have yourself a last cup
of tea, charley.
i'd like to see button again,
miss barlow.
of course.
i know the way.
whew.
been riding with him 10 years.
never said nothing
about being married.
where are you and mr. spearman
spending the night?
don't rightly know.
it... depends on circumstances.
you mean marshal poole?
we have a spare room.
it's yours if you want it.
couldn't do that, ma'am.
we'd be putting you in a spot
with the marshal and baxter.
besides, it's a small town.
wouldn't look right,
particularly with the doc away.
i'll take those.
you know where they go?
i saw.
thank you.
been raining like hell
ever since we got here.
water washing right down
main street.
charley saved a pup
from being washed away.
looked a little like old tig.
now, if you can, you got to
listen and pay attention.
'cause i got something
important to say.
i ain't been looking after you
for you to go out this way.
the world ain't
a perfect place, button.
but you got
unfinished business here.
so you come back,
you hear me, now?
you come back.
kind of dumb talking to him
like that.
no.
no, it's good.
you all right, mr. spearman?
believe i'm as right as a man
can be under the circumstances.
circumstances? that's just what
mr. waite called them.
i asked him to reconsider,
and i'm asking you.
by "reconsider,"
you mean tuck tail and run?
i mean save your life and his.
he'll listen to you.
charley thinks for hisself,
miss barlow.
he's a good man, and he knows
what has to be done.
i'll be paying you now
for whatever else button needs.
in case it goes bad
for charley and me,
maybe you and the doc will see
we're taken care of properly.
i'd like to put pen to paper
if you have them.
yes. of course.
mr. waite?
look at my face.
- oh! sorry!
i'm sorry.
it's all right, charley.
okay?
it just be us.
it's all right, charley.
it's all right, charley.
it's all right.
i'll get it.
jumpy is all.
she ought not to sneak up
like that.
she weren't sneaking.
i scared that woman
half to death.
yeah.
scared me a little bit, too.
well, that's how it is, boss.
ain't a pretty picture.
got your wits about you now?
yeah.
yeah.
it weren't as bad as it looked.
i'll bet.
go! hyah!
two whiskeys, barkeep.
barkeep!
two whiskeys.
you see that sign?
around these parts,
free grazers is the first.
now, he asked you twice.
ain't gonna ask again.
hey, bill, it's all right.
these are the fellows
that saved my dog.
i couldn't serve them
if they saved jesus himself.
mr. baxter would have my job.
baxter the owner?
that's right.
give me a bottle.
i'll serve them myself.
you know i can't do that.
now we'll have our drinks.
believe i'll have me another.
yes.
well, looks like the rain's
let up a bit.
well, if it don't,
there'll be trout fishing
right on main street.
i'd like you to meet my boys.
ray and cory.
we run a freight outfit
when the weather cooperates.
boss spearman.
and the marksman here
is charley waite.
is all that true,
what you said in the café?
yeah.
there's a kid at the doc's house
put on death's doorstep
by baxter.
doc's wife's caring for him
until he comes back
after the storm.
doc's wife?
yeah.
miss barlow.
you mean sue?
that's right.
well, she'd make somebody
a fine wife.
but she ain't the doc's.
that's his sister.
his sister?
ain't his wife.
good evening, mack.
ralph.
ray, cory.
whiskey.
this is ralph peterson.
he runs the general store.
that's where i was
when the dog got free.
you fellers the free grazers,
i expect.
no offense.
personally, i don't stand
with others around here
about free grazers.
there was a fight in your store
about a week or so back.
some of baxter's men
jumped our friend.
he was a big feller.
yeah.
i saw the whole thing.
that big feller drubbed the hell
out of them other three.
broke one's arm.
be a gunhand named butler,
would it?
that's what they say.
felt bad about your friend.
is he all right?
he's dead.
that's too bad.
seemed like
a nice young feller.
it's a shame what this town
has come to.
you could do something
about it.
what?
we're freighters.
ralph here's a shopkeeper.
you're men, ain't you?
i didn't raise my boys
just to see them killed.
well, you may not know this,
but there's things that gnaw
on a man worse than dying.
hey!
evening, gents.
evening.
better get out of this weather,
or your bones are gonna be
even stiffer than mine.
heading into the saloon
to do just that.
come looking for you boys.
i'd have bought you a drink
if you was earlier.
then turn around
and do it now.
marshal's got men waiting to
waylay you back at the livery.
another one's in your wagon.
and then there's another
in the shed across from it.
marshal with them?
no.
he's sitting up there
all by his lonesome
in that warm, dry jailhouse
with his feet up
waiting for them
to bring you in.
or kill you.
well, thanks for the warning.
like i told you, never been
partial to the marshal's ways.
dent baxter's either.
you're near the only friend
we got in this town.
i'll be buying a drink or two.
you keep it quiet, all right?
time's come.
how you want to play it?
well, i work for you, boss.
i'll play it however you want.
nobody works for anybody here,
charley.
now, the name butler mean
anything to you?
you hear names when you're on
the other side of things.
he as fast as they say?
he's a killer.
know him if you saw him?
he ain't hard to recognize
if you know
what you're looking for.
yeah.
too bad if we get
shot up tonight
before we get a chance
at him and baxter.
sure as hell is.
tell you what,
i'd like to sit someplace dry
while the marshal's men
sit out in this rain.
won't be so steady
come morning.
small town.
it's hard to hide even at night
in this weather.
what do you want to do?
yep.
heard me an idea
sounded pretty good.
you did, did you?
well, all right.
he's alone.
get your hands up.
you must be plumb crazy.
shut up.
you're dead men.
didn't he tell you to shut up?
what's that?
chloroform.
stole it from the doc's.
you gonna arrest me
for that, marshal?
jesus.
well, looky here.
he's asleep.
no.
looky here.
put 'em down.
this way.
what do you think?
do you like it?
you like it,
you son of a buck, you?
- huh?
a little bit more?
a bit more?
a bit more.
wasn't no call to leave me
setting out like that.
- there wasn't a lot of time.
- i ain't bait, charley.
i hear you.
best you remember it.
well, i guess you ain't gonna
let me forget, are you?
starting to enjoy that part,
aren't you?
sorry if we woke you.
no, no.
you didn't.
- come to see if...
- go see for yourself.
hey.
- hey, boss.
- hey.
you gave us a fright, pard.
thought we was gonna lose you.
just taking a little nap,
that's all.
it's good to have you back.
we owe you, miss barlow,
and we thank you.
you best thank god instead.
yes, ma'am.
we'll... give that a try.
well, i expect you men
are hungry.
button just ate.
i thought i'd make myself
some breakfast.
two more mouths wouldn't be
any bother.
i'm just gonna change.
you.
you should try to sleep.
he will.
now, you do as she says now.
yes, boss.
okay.
boss?
yeah?
mose?
i'll be along in a minute,
charley.
be seeing you, button.
aah.
if you don't mind my saying,
ma'am, you look...
tired.
oh.
it's been a long night.
why don't you sit?
let an old cowpoke cook up
some breakfast.
no, i couldn't let you.
sure, you could.
thank you.
i want to apologize
for earlier.
oh, no, no.
there's no need.
you were startled.
no, it was more than that.
i've been trying to put
some bad times behind me.
but sometimes
they don't stay put.
always makes me feel better
to let things breathe a little.
not bury them.
i'm learning that.
trying, anyway.
well, that's all
any of us can do.
just glad button's
getting better.
don't believe i've ever seen
boss so worried.
well, the doctor will be
on his way home
as soon as the storm's passed.
by the doctor,
you mean your brother?
it's just we've been thinking
that you and the doc was...
husband and wife.
oh.
you did?
didn't find out
till last night.
thought you was married, sue.
why, no.
i'm...
i'm not, charley.
well, that's good.
i mean that's good to know.
otherwise,
we'd been thinking wrong.
we wouldn't want to do that.
no.
no, of course not.
much obliged to you, ma'am.
you're very welcome,
mr. spearman.
thank you, sue.
take care of yourself,
charley.
are you just gonna go off like
that without saying nothing?
ain't nothing to say.
i seen how you look at that gal
and the way she looks at you.
it ain't right to walk away
without a word.
what do you want me
to tell her, boss?
we probably ain't gonna make it?
be a big fat comfort.
i don't know what you should
tell her, charley.
i wish i'd have said more
to my wife before she passed.
this may be the last time she
sees you in this world, charley.
or you her.
so tell her whatever you can.
'cause she's entitled to more
than just your backside
walking away.
charley.
i'm not sure
what's worth saying or not.
well, you don't have to
say anything.
yeah, i do.
boss is right about that.
he's right
about a lot of things.
it's just...
i'm not who you think
i am, sue.
i've... been places.
i've done things.
most of them, i'm not proud of.
you know, i always hoped
somebody gentle and caring
might come along.
years pass.
a small town and all.
and your hopes begin to fade
a little every day
until you hardly remember
what they were.
i've seen who you are, charley.
the way you looked after
that boy
and the respect you give boss.
it might be little bits.
but they're enough
for a woman who looks.
men are gonna get killed
here today, sue.
and i'm gonna kill them.
you understand that?
yes.
i want you to have this.
it's always brought me luck.
i... can't take your locket.
it's not your choice
when it's a gift.
it's a good likeness of you.
it's my mother
when she was young.
she's beautiful.
i want you to know that
if i don't ever see you again
that i meant everything
i said to you
and i appreciate everything
you said to me.
ain't nothing that happened in
this old town been a surprise.
except you.
i'll be seeing you,
charley waite.
happy?
yeah.
if you are.
morning, boys.
brung you breakfast.
hey, you kids.
come away from there.
come on.
you get along.
what do you suppose
this looks like?
it don't matter.
whole town knows
there's a fight coming.
they just hope it don't
spill over to them.
well, if i'm gonna get killed,
i got a hankering to soothe
my sweet tooth.
morning.
morning.
what can i do for you fellers?
thinking about some candy.
- candy?
- yeah.
yes, sir.
candy.
got anything you want.
- got jawbreakers.
- yeah.
gumdrops, candy canes,
licorice, caramel, honey crisp.
jujubes, lollipops,
milk chocolate...
looking for something special.
now, what's the most expensive
you've got?
well...
ooh.
i got just the thing.
- this is dark chocolate.
- yeah.
it comes all the way
from switzerland, europe.
that's near france, see.
they call it bittersweet.
melts in your mouth.
- you tried it?
- no.
how do you know
it melts in your mouth?
well, truth is
we can't afford it ourselves.
mm-hmm.
i'll take two.
don't you want to know how much?
nope.
yes, sir.
and three of your finest cigars.
my friend and me got a hankering
for switzerland chocolate
and a good smoke.
now, these come all the way
from havana, cuba.
thank you.
- anything else?
- no. that'll do it.
how much i owe you?
it's... $5.
charley.
here you are.
believe i'll enjoy
these later, boss.
yep.
you ought to do yourselves
a favor and ride on
while you still got time.
tried minding
our own business.
this is good.
worth every penny.
you're gonna
get yourselves killed.
try that, ralph.
go on.
sitting right here
in front of you.
never even tried it.
shame to go forever without
taking a taste of something.
charley, let's go.
percy!
up here!
brought you a cigar.
all the way from havana, cuba.
you don't say?
i've heard about them,
but i never had one.
much obliged to you.
what do you think?
better than them crappers
i usually smoke.
so, you're gonna make
your stand down here?
yeah.
but out there around our wagon.
not much choice without getting
a lot of innocent folks shot up.
like to place some guns and ammo
where we can get to it
on a short run.
help yourself.
we'll try to stay
out of your barn.
might not be able to.
best bring in your livestock.
be wishing you good luck now.
thank you.
it's a pretty day
for making things right.
well, enjoy it.
because once it starts,
it's gonna be messy
like nothing you ever seen.
i ain't survived my years
without being in
some fights, charley.
i ain't doubting
your grit, boss.
you got more than any man
i ever known.
it's just that...
i don't mean to be hard.
it's just the other night,
them fellows
back in them trees we let go.
it was my call, charley.
i can see now
it was probably a mistake.
it's not what i meant.
i mean, maybe it was.
but the fact is it's what i
always respected about you.
what i always appreciated.
how you treated other people
and how you treated me.
how you never look
for no trouble.
that kept me from trouble.
but it's found us here, boss.
and if we're to have
any chance, you'll...
you go on and talk, charley.
i'll hear you.
i'm almost certain
they'll be overly confident
in their numbers.
especially if we're standing
right out here in front of them.
it's not like we'll have
any advantage.
but if they're out there
with us,
then they won't have as much
as they might have otherwise.
i don't figure all of them
to be killers.
only two or three like butler
will have done much of it.
i'll be looking to him.
the others will be hired men.
probably saddle tramps.
maybe ex-army.
the rest will be cowpunchers.
they won't want to line up
in front of us.
it'll happen fast
once i start.
so just keep yourself
moving forward.
and they'll either move or root.
maybe even freeze up.
it don't matter which.
you just start right in on them
with that scatter-gun.
when you've done both barrels,
drop it, pull your pistol,
and make a run for that building
where we stashed them others.
i'll be trying to do the same
if i can.
right.
sounds like you got it
all worked out.
yeah.
except the part
where we don't get killed.
best smoke these
while we got the chance.
yeah.
i'm thinking about getting out
of the damn cattle business.
you never said nothing
except nag me and button
about getting ourselves out.
well, maybe my own words
struck a chord.
thought maybe
i'd sell off the cattle
and have enough to start up
a saloon somewhere.
man could stay cool
in the summer
and dry in the winter.
some dancing girls might be
nice, you know?
have to get me some.
yeah.
"if i die,
please sell my good horse
and my good saddle and my guns
to buy a tea set
for miss barlow. "
"charley waite. "
"postscript...
i like this one.
but i don't know. "
"princess pattern. "
oh, hell.
what's the matter?
oh.
looks like you waited too long.
kind of like us
and free grazing.
well, good is good.
melted or not.
looks like you're plumb chained,
to your work, marshal.
get up, poole.
he ain't worth a damn.
get them all up!
sobered up!
ooh.
i got a feeling there's gonna be
a new marshal in town.
all right!
it's time to settle
these free grazers.
oh, you leave your horses.
we're walking down
to their wagon.
when we get there, you better
empty your guns in them.
or i'll damn well
shoot you myself.
now, you three skirt
the buildings.
get into the alleys
on the side.
- come on.
hayley!
come away from there.
finish these later.
okay.
i'm not going to my maker
without knowing your given name.
mine ain't waite.
it's postelwaite.
charles travis postelwaite.
what's yours?
sure ain't boss.
i mean it, boss.
i'm asking you straight up.
it's bluebonnet.
bluebonnet?
bluebonnet, yeah.
no middle name?
no, just bluebonnet spearman.
and don't you tell no one.
i want to hear you swear
an oath. now, go on.
i swear it.
all right.
okay.
just in case.
said eight.
count five.
you should have run when you
had the chance, spearman.
not much for running
from cowards.
i see the marshal ain't
with you.
you won't find it so funny
when you're all shot to hell
and dying.
- you the one killed our friend?
- that's right.
i shot the boy, too,
and i enjoyed it.
hayley!
back up!
where's the back door?
- back door!
- right this way.
it's locked.
you hit?
i'm good.
you.
you get out of this house!
you pull that trigger, baxter,
and you can forget about me
patching you up.
you get your bag.
you're with me.
go on.
get the hell up, poole!
on your feet, god damn it!
yeah!
you're... going out there.
we ain't ourselves yet!
i see they hobbled you.
it's been a while
since i was in a fight.
i panicked. fell back.
like to have broke my foot.
ornery old fool.
well, or that damn cuban cigar
got me riled up.
charley.
you two wait here.
hold on, there, charley.
hold on.
i ain't looking over my shoulder
the rest of my days.
charley.
you said we was gonna
kill them all.
i aim to do just that.
i meant kill them.
not murder them.
splitting hairs,
ain't you, boss?
mister, i heard what you said.
i won't come after you.
i promise.
no, i expect you won't.
i ain't gonna let you
do it, charley.
you do this, you ain't no
different than poole or baxter
or that gunhand of his
that murdered mose.
him killing mose
is how this started.
we come for justice,
not vengeance.
them is two different things.
not today, they ain't.
step aside!
listen to him, son.
you done what you had to here
because they give you no choice.
don't go making this
into something bad.
this ain't the way, pard.
mister, thank you.
thank you.
didn't do it for you, boy.
just make peace
with your bad deeds.
sue!
get in here!
oh, my god.
get out of the way.
button!
- put it down.
- let the lady be!
we got your boy, spearman!
you better drop them guns
and come walking down the street
or i shoot him.
you've got ten seconds!
we ain't giving up our guns.
he's gonna kill button anyway.
one!
the only chance for him or us
when we walk up is these guns.
two!
three!
sue!
stop!
stop it!
stop it right now!
four!
sue.
you're a disgrace,
marshal poole.
you always have been.
i know it.
that's just the way it is.
five!
six!
have a nice rest,
did you, marshal?
you'll be having a long one
yourself in a minute.
been enough killing for you?
be enough when you're
both dead and buried.
let the woman and boy go.
they ain't a part of this.
if you want considerations,
you drop them guns
on the ground.
let her take him to the doc's.
the doc's in jail,
and he ain't leaving
unless your guns
are in the dirt.
i'll crush any man
who stands with them!
when i finish that,
i'll torch your homes and drive
your wives and children
out into the cold prairie.
so you women, you better
take hold of your men.
if you don't, you'll be raising
orphans by winter.
mack langly!
it doesn't matter
whether you run or stay!
you and your boys
are already dead!
mack langly is our friend!
i didn't come all the way
from ireland
to see my land pissed on
by free grazers.
now, i want them guns
in the dirt.
him first.
the gunhand.
looks like you're losing
your army, marshal.
get down!
it went through?
yeah.
is he hit, sue?
- sue, is he hit?
- no! no!
but he's bleeding bad again!
god damn it.
can you stop it?
i'm trying.
i'm gonna kill you, baxter!
well, come on, if you're coming!
can you cover me?
might be best to wait him out.
probably bleed to death.
i ain't waiting.
button needs that doctor
right now.
well, you know,
that door's locked.
well, it won't be
when the scatter-gun hits it.
i'm waiting for you, spearman!
i'm coming for you,
you son of a bitch.
okay, charley?
yeah.
you ready?
yeah.
i'm dying.
and for what?
more cows?
killed a good man.
and maybe that boy
out there out yonder.
you get no sympathy
for your death.
get!
you're... nothing.
yeah? maybe so.
but i'll still be breathing
in another minute.
well, kill me, then.
no.
i ain't wasting a good bullet
to ease your pain,
you son of a bitch.
your man's in the saloon.
ordered everybody out.
asked to see your sister
iffen she's willing.
he'd like to speak with you,
miss barlow,
iffen you ain't offended
by entering a saloon.
sue.
doc.
bring him on up.
put him in there.
we'll make room.
baxter got any kin?
daughter is all he has left.
it'd be right if somebody
explained things to her.
there never was
any love lost between 'em.
even so, she's his daughter.
and kin is funny
about such things.
come on.
come on.
i didn't mean for you
to have to...
walk into this place
in front of those people.
i don't care what anyone
out there thinks, charley.
you don't have to
stand up for me.
well, just the same,
i wanted to tell you that i'll
be leaving in a day or two.
i'd like you to stay.
i think others would, too.
i can't say i haven't
thought about it.
truth is, there wouldn't be
a corner here
that don't have
a bad memory for me.
i've been holding my love
a long time, charley.
i know you feel something
for me, too.
i do.
but i ain't no more
than those who come to kill us.
you seen that yourself.
maybe you've done
some bad things.
maybe worse than bad.
but what happened here today
wasn't one of 'em.
and those killings,
they don't give you pause?
i'm not afraid of you, charley.
it brought me luck.
just like you said.
it's yours now.
you keep it.
i don't have the answers,
charley.
but i know that people
get confused in this life
about what they want
and what they've done
and what they think they
should have because of it.
everything they think they are
or did takes hold so hard
that it won't let them see
what they can be.
i've got a big idea
about us, charley.
and i'm not gonna wait forever.
but i am gonna wait.
and when you're far away,
i want you to think about that.
and... come back to me.
i'm in love with you, sue.
been that way since
i first laid eyes on you.
just took me a while
to see things clear.
i know i'm not the kind of man
you expected to walk up
your front walk.
if i was your brother,
i wouldn't choose me for you.
charley...
do you know how old i am?
don't care how old you are.
i'm not a girl anymore.
you're the handsomest woman
i ever saw.
i've had my disappointments,
charley.
well, i'm not gonna be
one of them.
i never thought i'd live
as long as i have, sue.
i guess living the way i have,
it never really mattered.
but thinking i was never gonna
see you again was maybe...
was maybe the most awful feeling
i ever had in my life.
i know i can be
a good husband to you.
and i know i ain't
asked you proper.
but i'm asking you now.
will you marry me, sue?
charley.
yes.
i'll marry you.
and can i kiss you?
i'm gonna give you a thousand
of these before i'm done.
hey, charley!
looks like the doc
changed his mind about you.
something wrong?
no.
everything's fine.
i forgot to tell you
i'll have word about the saloon
by the time you get back.
sounds good.
you take care, now.
charley.
sue.
i'll be along.
saloon?
told you i was wanting out
of the cattle business.
there's a saloon right back
there just had its owner die.
hoping you'd be my partner.
i cant afford something like that.
not even half.
well let the brains of the outfith
do the thinking.
sue!
you are coming back, aren't you?
and i will be waiting for you charles!
keep nothing private.
have to go back know.
i don't want to loose side of the roof tops.
i mean it sue.
got to go!
how this gonna work if
you don't do what i say.
i told you, i gonna get 8000
before i die!
you make sure you do.
