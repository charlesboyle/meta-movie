i've-i've done
my mid-life crisis.

look, i won.
come on, maisie,
you didn't let me play.
look at me.
you're cheating.
maisie,
do you ever wonder what
margo thinks of us
behind that
hauntingly calm exterior.
okay. enjoy-
do you want to be"xes"or"os"?
um, i want
to be"os".
the ants go marching one by one.
hurrah, hurrah.
the ants go marching one by one.
the little one stops
to suck his thumb.
you're a
liar and a thief.
this is a colossal
waste of time. fine, go.
hey.
hi.
susanna.
is that daddy?
shh, go back to sleep.
open the door.
open the damn door.
damn.

that fucking noise.
they hate me
in this building.
oh, there you are.
at last.
open the door.
susanna.

open the door.
no.
open the fucking door.
not this time. i told you it
would happen if you left.
what?
are you serious?
yes, i'm serious.
it's my apartment.
open the goddamn door.
no.
you're a fucking headcase.
fuck you!
now, remember
your soil should be damp,
not soaked.
you father's here.
maybe your dog died.
i don't have a dog.
you're never
going to lose money
on art
unless you overpay.
this is a good price.
i need to know if you
want the paintings,
i need to know asap. let me
just get rid of this call.
one second.
here is this
month's schedule.
we would prefer if you'd
wait the few extra minutes
until the end
of the school day
so that we don't have
to interrupt class.
okay. okay,
i'll make sure
that absolutely
doesn't happen again.
listen, why don't you and me go and
get ourselves a nice double espresso?
with mommy?
no, no, just you and me this time.
eh? fun, huh?
hey, so they're
exemplary pieces--
are you kidding me? what were you going to do?
take her to argentina?
i'll call you back. people, just
do i need to get some help?
no. this is not a game, beale.
come on, baby.
daddy's not going
to pick you up anymore.
i'm just going to pick you up, okay?
are you okay?
it's okay.
i'm only her father.
wow, pooh, you have
your own tv?
yeah, we can
watch it later.
hey, cool.

before i go?
no, i'm all set, thanks.

"with your hook and
line i still blow away"
"with your hook and line
i still blow away"
zoey.

the heart line.

a very interesting man.

to be in bed.
zoey's crying.
oh.
i'm really sorry.

um, all right.
thanks for coming.
goodnight.

bye, zoey.
bye.
bye, zoey.
go back to bed,
baby,okay?
so much for
them testifying for me.
fuck it.
the mom's
a total nazi anyway.
okay, maisie,
come on, which one?
that one.
you dressed yet?
we don't have time for that.
we're late.
here.
put these on.
okay.
you can definitely mention
the time he threw you.
he did?
oh, my god, yeah.
he threw you
across the room
onto the couch
yelling in your face.
jesus.
don't you remember?
it was like your most
earth-shattering moment.
maisie?
do you and your mom
sing together sometimes?
sometimes.
is it fun?
i hope you get
what a farce this is.
it's ridiculous.
we're not even married.
and listen, you know,
whatever he says--
be sure to factor in thirty
years of substance abuse.
do you want the chicken?
uh-huh.
okay. might be
a little bit spicy.
how does that happen?
here you go.
hello?
if you think
it's all right.
your dad's coming up.
hey.
oh, my sixth
favorite girl.
who's your other girls?
oh, i can't tell you
about those.
why not?
it's a secret.
do you want
some mandarin chicken?
mm, that sounds good.
hi.
i think she's coming back soon.
i know.
i'm going to grab a few
things and then we'll, uh,
we'll keep this
our little secret.
don't want to get margo
decapitated, no?
uh-uh.
okay.
okay, i got to dash.
but don't worry.
i'm fixing things, okay?
and, uh,
thank you.
you're one
in a million.
hey.
okay, thanks.
you're a prince.
that's byron downstairs.
she's on her way up.
hey, up, up, up.
come on.
the doors don't open
until ten after eight.
i've got to be at court
in 15 minutes.
all right, i guess she can come in.
thanks.
love you.
my mum says you're
supposed to come with me.
to your house? no, we're
going to walk you home.
bye.
bye.
hi, maisie.
hi, byron.
you're not capable
of taking care of a child.
you know better.
no, i know you.
really?
yes, yes.
i know you.
susanna, you don't know
anyone except yourself.
you breathe pain wherever you go.
shut up, shut up.
that's why the judge and
the expert, they saw that.
they saw you.
no.
then why are they not
giving you sole custody?
because you got a female
judge, that's why.
if that's what you want to
tell yourself, then fine.
don't take her, man.
i'm not taking her.
don't take her. i'm not taking her.
they gave her to me.
hey.
hey, baby.
just the person
we want to see.
honey, why don't you get
some clothes and things
and stuff
to take with us?
just do it.
it's okay.
it's okay.
she doesn't need you telling her
what i say is okay, asshole!
temper, temper.
there you go.
i'm right behind you.
hi, maisie.
hi.
can i take
your bag?
you want to see
your room?
so, what do you think?
you know, you have
margo to thank
for...most
of the stuff.
why don't i let you two catch
up on the world events?
so,
you surprised
to see me?
it's kind
of funny, huh?
hello. hello.
hello. hello.
how much?
that's academic. look, no one
in america has heard of him.
i don't know why but--
fine, okay,
let's see.
okay, bye.
you can write
in straight lines.
you got it.
i may need to take off to
italy in the next few weeks.
oh.
so, you think you could,
uh, keep an eye on maisie?
okay, sure.
go on, start again. you know you're only
supposed to do the first letter, right?
your passport
is in order, right?
mine?
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
good. yeah.
because this work should
only take a few days.
i thought after that maybe we
could go on a little cruise
in the aeolian islands,
you know, say
something like that.
yeah. i've never been to italy.
oh.
or on a boat.
right, great. well,
then, that's good.
we'll do that. we're
going on a boat? when?
well, don't start
packing just yet, okay?
it's all depending.
what's all this?
i got a flower
delivery for maisie beale.
maisie? oh.
that's just-- this is
totally inappropriate.
get them back
to the delivery guy.
the guy
already left.
okay, i'll take it.
ten minutes and then
homework, okay?
okay.
sweetie?
what are these?
i don't know.
but, i mean, did you
put them in there?
maisie?
mommy sent them.
oh.
well, we should put them
in some water.
can't i just keep them
in the closet?
why?
'cause daddy
threw them out.
oh.
he's allergic.
really?
i'll tell you what.
why don't we press a few, and
then you can keep them forever?
that'll be our
little secret, okay?
okay. why don't you pick
some of your favorites?
okay.
i like this one.
this one. okay, here's our book.
and this one.
when we go back to mommy's, can
we bring starbrite's corral?
um, sweetie, i'm not
going with you.
oh.
i'll be here
when you get back.
okay-
so, where do we put the flowers?
in the middle?
you put them
in this side.
gently.
you now, your daddy's sad
when you're not here, right?
so, um.
it's nice for him
to have someone around
to...cheer him up.
and do the shopping
and everything, too.
so, since
we like each other,
we thought that maybe
i could do that.
how does that sound?
good.
let's do another.
okay.
i think the roses
would be too big.
yeah.
that one's nice.
try that one.
oh, my baby,
i missed you so much.
i missed you, too.
look.
jesus.
jesus, how
did that happen?
i touched my arm
on the stove
and i got burned
and i cried.
i bet you did.
i bet that hurt.
how did it happen? did daddy let
you cook by yourself or something?
oh, god.
okay.
the court says that i'm not
supposed to say anything,
but i would be, like, totally
negligent if i didn't tell you
that you really
have to watch yourself
when you're alone
with daddy, okay?
margo was there.
margo?
you mean,
you mean our margo?
margo who was at our house?
that margo?
you have a nice
room at daddy's?
uh-huh, i have
a canopy bed.
oh, that's nice.
does margo have
a nice room?
it's tiny, and when you look out
the window, there's a wall.
ooh, daddy must not like her very much
if he gives her a room like that.
he likes her.
yeah?
does he-- does he
give her a kiss?
anything like that? show
her how much he likes her?
i don't know.
no?
no, huh?
yes, yes, i'm sure. she just told me.
hang on a second.
hey, baby, go play in your
room for a little bit.
i'm going to finish
this phone call, okay?
no, he's got her
living with him.
what do you think i want? i want you
to take that asshole back to court
and get me
sole custody.
maisie?
careful, maisie.
why would you be
afraid of her?
i mean, fine, maybe she
looks a little funny,
but that's, like,
really narrow minded.
i don't want you to grow up
to be one of those people
'cause it's just
not cool.
and you know what? she's the kind
of nanny you're supposed to have.
i mean, she's not some tramp
with a daddy fixation.
she smells funny. she
does not smell funny.
that's the way a nanny
is supposed to smell.
come on.
okay, let's go.
come on, maisie,
let's go.
get your stuff, sweetie.
hey, turn around.
you're going to see him soon enough.
i will?
you're going to be a flower girl.
i am?
yeah, there's nothing
he won't do.
here comes
the fucking bride.
the collar is sticking
up a little bit there.
yeah, good.

fairchild- tettenbaum.
this is my third message. i
would appreciate a call back.
thank you.
maisie, are you sure
your mother knows
she's supposed
to pick you up?
i don't know.
all right.
i'll figure
something out.
oh, mais.
i thought that maisie's mother was
supposed to be doing pick up today.
she is. if my husband hadn't checked
his messages at the airport,
we'd be on a plane. i'm
supposed to be on my honeymoon.
hey, excuse me.
is this, uh--
susanna nun. she sent
me to get her daughter.
who are you?
uh, i'm her, uh,
sort of like
maisie's stepfather.
you're what? yeah, i'm
married to susanna.
hey.
how-how are you, maisie?
i'm lincoln.
do you remember me ? we met
before a few weeks ago.
remember that?
this is--
we don't just release children to
anyone walking into the office.
um, no, of course, no.
so, i've got maisie, and
i don't know what to do,
so can you please
call me back?
i can't get
hold of him.
would you want
to call susanna?
just if you want to make
sure i'm not some random--
i'm not going
to call susanna.
why don't you call her?
yeah. yeah, sure. i can call.
hey, it's me.
yeah,no,
it's good.
i'm outside the school
here with maisie,
and margo is here.
i understand.
yeah, well, she doesn't
really know who i am.
yeah, all right.
just one second.
uh, it's susanna.
hello?
yes.
i heard you.
okay, so i'll just
take maisie--
he-hello?
susanna?
hello?
okay.
uh, i guess
that's done.
yeah, i guess.
i've got to go.
you need a cab?
yeah.
i'll get you one.
hey, taxi.
hi.
okay, maisie, i'll
see you in ten days.
i don't want you to go.
it'll be okay, okay?
i promise.
i have to go.
i don't want
to go with him.
oh, maisie.
i really, really love you. okay?
okay.
see you
in ten days, okay?
bye, sweetie.
have a nice honeymoon.
bye, maisie.
please say bye.
jfk, please.
yeah, we should
probably wait.
she's lost it.
no, we need some more.
oh, i'll be back.
baby just came home.
i have to kiss you.
mommy?
yeah?
did you really
get married?
uh-huh. but i still
love you the best.
and i'm still
your mommy, right?
and, you know, he's just-he's
just like a friend.
you don't have to call
him daddy or anything.
just like-just like you don't
call margo mommy, right?
you can just
call him lincoln.
did you have
a flower girl?
oh, you know what? if we
did, it would've been you.
but we kept it
really low key,
and, um, it was just like with a
justice of the peace kind of thing.
we didn't even
have a cake.
no cake?
no cake.
sad but true.
here, want
to see something?
you want to see what he gave me?
look at this.
look at that.
it's tiny.
it is tiny, isn't it?
tiny, tiny,
little one.
hey.
hey.
sorry.
it's okay.
come on in.
i-i got to go
to work actually.
okay.
it was nice
seeing you again, maisie.
say goodbye
to lincoln.
bye.
bye.
how tall he is.
he's so tall.
doe she always work at night?
yeah.
he's pretty much just a bartender,
but you know, whatever.
it's good, so when i'm
working, he can watch you.
it's going to be good.
can i tell you
a secret?
i married him for you.
i married him for you.
"sleep tight
on the night train"
"no pain"
"i don't remember"
"oh a couple
of years"
"did some
good for you"
"no your eyes"
hey, it's too thin.
i want to do
a couple more,
and then i want to
hear it doubled, okay?
you go it.
what are you making?
is it a palace?
it's a castle.
oh, yeah.
yeah, of course.
it's beautiful.
you're really good.
i don't know how to make
one of those...bridges.
like a drawbridge?
well, just, um,
if you make
the doorway here
and then like the bridge going
down and then some chains.
that's it.
with a moat.
i can't do it.
you do it.
but it's your drawing.
really? okay.
maybe you can draw
some animals in the moat,
some dangerous animals so
people can't swim across.
crocodiles and some
polar bears
and stuff
that will eat you.
okay.
i haven't used a crayon in a
really, really long time.
when i was a kid, i read
this story about a family,
and their car
broke down in the desert.
and do-do you know how
they survived? how?
they ate crayons
and paste.
ew.
it sounded
pretty good to me.
i used to sneak paste to eat
when i was a kid. you did?
"i don't remember"
"ooh a couple"
the stuff we had
was really good.
delicious. you should try it.
no.
no?
hey.
you want to come in the
booth with me while i sing?
okay.
come on.
hey. you didn't
say goodbye.
yes, i did.
no, you didn't.
i'm going to miss you.
i'm going to miss you so much.
okay.
all right.
i'll see you in ten days, okay?
bye, baby.
you cannot tell him, so that
you really can't show him.
excuse me.
excuse me.
who's that?
hey. what are you
still doing here?
um, ok-- le-let's go.
let's go and check.
no, no, he didn't forget.
he knows it's his pick up day.
honeymoon my ass.
he's messing with me.
look, it's a violation
of the court order,
and he agreed to those
dates before he left.
you got
to be kidding me.
great, okay.
so, he says it's a violation
of the court order
for them to not
let us pick her up.
but if they don't pick her up,
it's not a violation, okay?
he knows it's
his pick up day.
maybe--
what, what, what?
we could go back to the court again.
no, no.
i'm not subjecting
myself to that bullshit.
where are
my cigarettes?
jesus.
a witch hunt,
that's what it is.
hey, are you hungry?
do you get to make all
the food for everyone?
uh, no.
i'm just-i'm just
a bartender.
do you get
lots of money?
well, i get tips.
but not lots of money.
i wouldn't say that, no.
do you think it's important
to make lots of money?
uh-huh.
how come?
so you can be rich. oh, of
course, so you can be rich.
what if you like doing something
where you don't make lots of money?
like what?
like being a teacher.
or maybe you want
to be a nurse.
or a fireman.
or a bartender.
yeah, or a bartender.
for now.
here we go.
bon appetit.
i-i thought you said
you liked eggs.
i don't want
to ruin it.
okay, see you later.
you're supposed
to walk me in.
are you sure
we don't say bye here?
really?
okay.
maisie has something she'd
like to share with the class.
this is my new
stepfather.
hi.
my father
married my nanny,
so court made my mommy
get married, too.
tyler.
i've two stepfathers.
but one
is almost dead.
"and most castles had 50
rooms and were in england.
"if someone hurt your
animal or tried to be rich,
"they would be killed
and put in jail.
"a lot of people in jail
hurt their-selves
"so that they could go to
the hospital and have food.
"they ate stale bread, and then
gave the bread to the homeless.
the end. life in a castle
by maisie elizabeth beale."
wow.
that's amazing.
what am i, invisible?
you know, you don't get a bonus for
making her fall in love with you.
hey, baby, why don't you go to
your room for a little while
so lincoln and i
can talk, okay?
dude, how am i supposed to go away
on to work and leave her with you
when you're full
of shit?
what are you talking about?
and when did this tour come?
you deliberately
undermine me.
why does everything have
to be such a nightmare ?
you know, i've turned
into this like petty--
i don't recognize
myself anymore.
you know, baby, all i wanted was for
him to make things easier for us.
your story
is very cool.
thank you.
hey.
what are you
thinking about?
nothing.
no?
you want to come to
work with me tomorrow?
maybe you could help me pick
out my costumes for the tour.
would you like that?
your dad's an asshole.
he really is.
first he disappears, and then
he shows up out of nowhere.
i don't know
how to deal with this.
i really don't.
baby, i got
to lie down.
lincoln,
beale's downstairs.
hey.
come here.
whoa. you missed me? uh-huh.
yeah, we were wondering when we
were going to see you again.
you're the husband?
yeah.
it's-it's
the new husband.
my name is lincoln. it's beale.
pleased to meet you.
nice to meet you.
i'd give you a couple of pointers
but i doubt that the, uh,
jacoby and tragedy
that was our relationship
would apply to the farce that
you two guys are playing out.
okay. okay.
anyway, good luck
yeah.
bye, maisie.
whoa.
bye.
thank you.
tall and young. ha.
it's funny.
he's so not her type.
hilarious.
how's your mom?
fine.
happy?
uh-huh.
a word that
sounds like owl?
tyler.
clown.
clown. excellent.
victor.
town.
town.
maisie.
sound.
sound. good.
which is
your favorite?
i like the blue one.
it's getting late, mais.
we should go.
are we still going
on a boat with daddy?
what boat, sweetie?
in italy,
like he said.
um, i don't know.
maybe.
are you and daddy
still married?
of course.
it's not like pretend?
no. why would you ask that?
i don't know.
oh, mais.
come on, beale,
you didn't even tell us
you were leaving.
first, we were going
to be coming with you,
and then it was only going
to be for a few days.
when are you
coming back?
what do you mean
you don't know?
hold on.
what are you
doing up?
does your throat
still hurt?
it's not time
for your medicine, yet.
i'm talking to your
father in london.
can i talk to him?
here's maisie.
daddy?
i don't feel good.
no.
i miss you, too.
it's me.
i don't know.
i told you.

want me to do?
susanna is going

but you know i love you
more than anything, right?
okay?
i do.
okay, go.
watch out.
okay.
okay, bye.
...hotel room.
she's in the bathroom
for like 15 minutes.
i'm watching television...
and she comes out
of the bathroom buck naked.
i'm like, okay, fine...
i push her up
against the glass--
your order, sir.
do you want to come sit over
here instead, by the cherries?
it's more fun
over there.
is it okay
if she sits here?
it's fine.
check this out.
hello?
ooh!
i can't hear you!
it's like
you're a monkey.
oh.
you got
an eye on that?
don't.
i that it?
again?
yeah, i'll try.
i'll call you back.
hey, maisie?
come here a minute.
they called
from-from work,
and someone
is sick today,
so i'm going to have to
go in and work probably.
i could go
with you again.
no.
no, we--
we can't do that.
it's not
a good idea.
don't bite
your nails.
you ate glue.
yeah.
all right, wise guy,
come on, let's go.
i'm not a guy.
i'm a girl.
yeah, come on,
wise girl.
what if she's not here?
i don't know.
maybe caroline
can come.
no, caroline's
got a boyfriend.
come on.
can i go to work with you then?
no, you can't.
oh, we'll-we'll figure
something out.
i know it's
late over there, beale.
i've been stuck in this
hallway for an hour.
just tell the guy at the door
to come up here and let me in.
hi.
what are you
doing here?
well, i-i know it hasn't
been ten days, yet.
but i-- he has to go to work.
yeah. yeah, it's, uh, you know,
things have been a little rough
with her mother gone
and-and all.
right.
you know, i was just thinking
like we're both in--
you thought what?
that i feel
sorry for you?
that i've got
nothing else to do?
that i'm just
that sort of person?
well, i'm not,
so you deal with it.
it's your problem,
not mine.
i didn't-i didn't
say that.
i am locked out
of my own apartment
because my husband didn't
bother putting me on the lease.
like i don't exist.
i have done everything
i was supposed to.
he can't use
people like this.
i-i didn't
realize that--
i'm really sorry.
just go.
please.
yeah.
come on, maisie.
i'm sorry.
you know i didn't
mean you, don't you?
thank you.
none of this
is your fault.
i'll see you
later, maisie.
it's not
lincoln's fault, either.
he's just
mixed up, too.
you really
like him, don't you?
i love him.
i'm sorry
i got mad at him.
he must think
i'm awful.
mommy gets mad
at him all the time.
there he is.
hey, maisie.
hey.
hi.
i did the icing
but it's from her
'cause she's sorry
she got mad at you.
oh.
a cake.
i told her that
you like chocolate.
i do like chocolate.
thank you.
thank you both.
uh, you guys hungry?
yeah? i know someone
who works here
so i might be able
to get you a table.
you work here.
yeah, i guess you're right.
i do work here.
uh, come on.
you know what some
people eat here ?
what? raw hamburger
with raw eggs on it.
ew.
these
are from lincoln.
would you eat a raw hamburger
with a raw egg on it?
never.
would you?
glasgow has got such
a vibe and a lot of culture.
it's so funny
'cause, like, to me
you don't have a very
thick scottish accent
when you say glasgow, glasgow.
that's nice.
yeah, it is, it is.
yeah, i always wonder
if i'll be now.
thank you for the
cake and tonight.
yeah.
okay.
goodnight.
morning.
morning.
how did you sleep?
good.
what do you want
for breakfast?
mm, i don't know.
pancakes.
okay.
pancakes it is.
lincoln.
sorry i'm late.
the wolf
is scaring her grandma.
oh, bummer.
she's chasing
the wolf there.
okay, higher.
higher.
don't get too close.
there are so many.
this is really cool.
i can't believe
i haven't been here before.
look, see, there's
a baby turtle.
whoa.
look at that guy.
he's checking you out.
so many of them.
this is great.
yeah, i like it here.
you know what?
what.
you could buy turtles
in the street.
they keep them in buckets,
and they're only $1.
really? wow. i was
bitten by a turtle once.
were you really?
yeah, yeah.
it even left
a scar if you--
big?
it could've left
a scar.
it's that bad. it could've left a scar.
right, yeah.
so, is it quite traumatic for you
being here with the turtles?
this is kind like therapy for me.
oh, it is? okay.
meeting the beast again.
that's the last one
until after dinner, okay?
daddy.
we'll do this. daddy!
hey, my favorite girl.
hey, you got heavy.
what a surprise. yeah, i
had a change of schedule.
i can smell candy.
we went to go see a puppet show.
did you now?
red riding hood.
oh, that's scary.
i was just about
to make some dinner.
ah, not for me, thanks.
i ate on the plane.
yuck.
i got a couple
of calls to make,
but i'll join you
guys later.
come on, maisie, we
should get washed up.

oh, hey, sweetie.
where is margo?
pff.
maybe she went
for along walk.
let's go get breakfast.
i, uh.
i don't need to tell you
things are a bit of a mess
since your mom
ran off.
she's on a big tour.
not so big
from what i hear.
but, uh, be that
as it may,
um, i may have
to go back to england.
um, couple of, you know,
business opportunities,
and your grandmother is
not getting any younger.
you...you understand?
can i come? we can-we
can get the coins.
coins?
what coins?
like your daddy found in the
ground when you were little.
you remember me
telling you that?
maybe we can find
some more.
would you like that?
yeah? just the two of us?
you and your old man
digging for coins?
i could do
with a few.
why not? your mother
would have a fit.
but i don't think i'd have a
problem squaring it with the judge
after she ditched
with that bartender.
sure i could settle with margo
without any legal nonsense.
why not?
why not?
why not?
will i get back
in time?
for what?
to go to mommy's.
this wouldn't be a day
excursion, you know that.
this would be
like a permanent thing.
all the time?
all the time.
maybe mommy would like
to live there, too.
no, there's
no mommy in england.
you can't--
there's a whole ocean.
it's--
you know,
england is, um--
england is pretty
cold, actually.
it rains a lot.
and, um.
and we need to have
to rethink, you know.
and you're on the fence,
i can see that.
i think you'd be
happier here.
all the same.
um, the good news
is that when i visit
america for work,
i can see you, too.
does your nose still make that
squeaky noise when you press it?
okay. you would have laughed at
that when you were four years old.
don't deny it.
take care, mr. beale.
sure.
bye.
okay, bye.
have a safe trip now.

i thought your father was a way.
well, he was here when we
came from the puppets.
well, i can't really
watch you now.
i got to be in chinatown
in half an hour,
and i'm sort
of late already.
is it still
margo's week?
she and daddy had a fight, and
this morning she was gone.
gone?
where did she go?
i don't know.
but daddy's
going to england,
and he said that
i could go with him
and then he said
that i couldn't.
and then we came in a
taxi and he left me here.
well, that's a lot.
okay, i'll--
why don't--
i'll call margo.
see if i can find her.
it'll be okay.
oh, there she is.
hey.
hey.
thanks.
thanks for coming.
yeah, of course
i came.
what if they
don't have a turtle?
i'm sure we'll find
one somewhere.
okay, well, actually
i have to go this way.
but i'll see your turtle
when i get home, okay?
thanks for your help.
okay, well, just call me.
mommy!
oh, my god, baby.
i'm so happy
to see you.
we're going
to get a turtle.
a turtle?
a turtle?
so, what are you two
doing with my daughter?
what are you talking about? looking
after her while you're on tour.

to our house, turtle?

laryngitis or something
or mercury poisoning,
all right?

out of it.
no, i'm not
leaving her.

supposed to do?

we got to go.
it really sucks but we got to go.
come on.
okay, baby.
i am so sorry but i
have-- i got to go.
i just can't miss
another show right now
because i'll have
a massive loss
and i just can't
handle that right now.
okay? but you know
what i'm going to do?
i'm going to have you full
now for a couple of shows
and then we can hang
out for a while
and then maybe we could
sing a duet together.
is that too phony?
okay, uh, you can hang out here with
lincoln until he's finished work
and then he's going
to take you home, okay?
i love you so much.
i got to go, baby.
maisie.
i'm going to wait
till you go inside, okay?
it's all right.
hey, hon.
remember me?
where's lincoln?
he's not on tonight.
who are you with?
my mom put me here so that
i could stay with him.
well, let me talk to your mom.
she left.
hi, still serving ?
absolutely.
um...stay
right here, okay?
i'll be right back.
right this way.
i'll keep making calls and

let's go back to bed.
i want to go home. i want to go home.
come here.
please, i want
to go home.
it's okay.
it's going to be fine.
just a couple of things,
okay, sweetie? okay.
what about
my turtle?
we'll get the turtle.
and you know what?
what? my cousin told
me where the key is.
guess where it is? where?
it's under the mat
on the back door.
you're going to be okay
with your bag?
uh-huh.
oh, god.
god, don't do this.
there's an upstairs.
yeah, you want
to go see?
it's cold.
feels good.
look.
what if someone buys the house?
where would we go?
it doesn't happen
that fast.
what if we had
to go somewhere else?
how would people know
where we are?
we tell them. what if
we couldn't find them?
we'd find them
and we'd tell hem.
anyway, i told them where we were
so they wouldn't be worried.
dinner's ready.
what do you think
this should be?
probably a window.
a window?
hey, maisie.
come on.
okay, let's go
to the beach.
can you hear the ocean? shh.
yes.
you can?
wow.
okay. two pails.
two pails?
let's trade.

where we can get worms.
and we can go on the boat
next door whenever we want.
oh,wow.
perfect.
we can go tomorrow if you want to.
lincoln just got here.
how long are you staying? well,
definitely long enough to go on the boat.
it's beautiful here.
uh, i brought you something from
the city i thought you might like.
wait, i'll
show you something.
there's a picture that i
thought might be interesting.
look at that.
look.
you know why?
why?
i was thinking we might
want this guy.
we can put him
in our moat.
in our moat, that was what
i was thinking. perfect.
you guys have a moat? of course.
okay-
what's that?
look at that.
do you want to pick it up?
look at that, maisie.
gently, gently. it's
holding onto the rock.
look, he's moving.
he's moving.
he's waving at you.
you're going to hold my hand?
yeah.
okay. don't stand on him.
could we go
on the boat tomorrow?
why don't you ask the
fishermen when they get back?
hold on. hold on.
he said we
could go tomorrow!
one, two three, four,
five, six, seven.
i want to buy it.
you already have it.
i want to buy a hotel.
can i have two?
yeah.
fifty?
are you kidding me?
you can't even buy a hostel.
you got to do better than that.
give me a little more.
two hotels you got to pay.
give me, uh--
oh, how generous of you. you don't
even get a sleeping bag for that.
we weren't allowed to play
monopoly when i was a kid.
what did you play instead? this
swiss doctor made some games.
they're supposed to instill
cooperation and pacifism.
that's probably why you're losing.
yeah. ha, ha, ha.
in my house, it was
every man for himself.
oh, thanks
for the warning.
what's funny?
you are.
yeah, you are. you are so funny.
you are so funny.
thank you.
okay.
no.
go to jail.
oh, come on.
i need some luck now.
it's not fair.
surprise.
ah, oh.
oh, my little
beach bunny.
hey, guess what? i'm playing
virginia beach tomorrow night.
i found this really
nice girl with a dog
who can watch you
during the show.
and then after that we go to
north carolina and tennessee.
why kind of a dog? i don't know.
but, um, it's kind
of a long drive,
so if you want to say goodbye to
these guys, you'd better hurry up.
okay, go ahead.
go on.
or you can just come back to
the bus and we can take off
and you can open all the
presents i got you.
you want to do that?
i want to meet the dog
but maybe the day after.
well, baby, the day after i'm
playing raleigh, so i got to go.
okay, come on. come on, let's go, babe.
come on, come on.
what's up? what's the matter?
come on.
we're supposed to go
on a boat tomorrow.
baby, we can go on a boat any day, okay?
it's not a big deal.
we got to go.
come on, let's go.
come on.
come on.
maisie, come on.
don't you want to come?
fine.
why did i
fucking bother?
god, what is if? you just decided
you don't like me anymore?
is that it?
what, are you
scared of me?
oh, shit.
i'm sorry, baby.
i'm so sorry.
i don't want you
to be scared.
i'm an idiot,
you know.
i'm, um--
hey, maisie, maisie,
baby, you know what?
i really love you.
i really do.
before you where born, i-i didn't
know it was possible to love somebody
as much
as i love you.
you're just like my,
my little baby.
can i tell you something?
along time
ago i was just like you.
i was just like you.
you want to go
on a boat tomorrow?
you want...to stay
with them for a while?
you know who
your mother is, right?

let's go open
your presents.
come on.

me how big you want it.
that's good.
that's good?
that's good.
do you know
where the filters are?
um, on the table.
look at that
little baby pancake.
that's tiny.
i want a big pancake.

another one?
