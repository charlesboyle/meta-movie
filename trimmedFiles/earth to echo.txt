hey, hey, tuck, dude.
- okay, we're rolling.
- okay, hold on.
b-before you go,
look-look at my coat.
- it's cool, huh?
- what is that?
can we do another take
with it on, though?
no.
okay.
ready when you are.
okay. how do i smell?
or i mean, look, or you know?
yeah, you can't smell a video.
okay.
ruckus, dude, you got
to get out of here.
hi, i'm reginald.
i don't really get friends much,
but it's probably
because i'm a bit of...
an acquired taste.
that's what my mom says.
and i'm sure whatever
school i'm forced to go to
no one will acquire it.
so...
thanks for paving
a road over, really,
the only place i've ever
had any real friends.
okay, we good?
- uh, say your name.
- i thought you knew my name.
you know what i mean; for the video.
dude, we've been
hanging out for years.
- come on.
- dude, stop fronting. just tell the camera.
you're upset, right?
you don't want to move.
i've never gone a day
without seeing my friends.
they're, like, the only people
in the world who get me.
and now it's just all over, you know?
good luck finding that again.
so wherever-wherever
munch is going, man...
look, you people listen
to me, all right?
he's-he's a really good kid.
so don't just assume
that he's weird and that's it.
and alex,
man...
he's a foster kid.
he's been moved all over.
i mean, it's like, why do you have
to build a freeway right through?
you know, can't you just
go around or something?
you're going along
feeling like
your own person
with your own friends,
and then something
like this comes along...
that you have no power to stop...
because you're just a kid.
you're just a kid.
yeah, hey, man.
yeah, yeah, i'm up, i'm up.
whoa, whoa, man, slow down.
what's the problem?
yeah, my-my phone's good. why?
what happened?
wait, what?
this is when everything
started to change.
so, being me,
i kept filming.
i'm tuck.
what you're about to
see happened to me
and my best friends one year ago.
this is the story of our
last week together.
phones all over
our neighborhood are freaking out.
we've done everything we could
possibly do with this phone.
we threw it at the wall,
we took it to the phone guy,
we took it to the store
where we got it from,
and they say it's a problem.
so you know it's serious.
it looks like your phone
basically barfed on the screen.
- what happened?
- i don't know.
i was just eating dinner,
and all of a sudden,
all the phones in the
house just did this.
at exactly the same time.
dude.
what? it's freaky.
- de hello?
- hey, alex.
oh, munch, you're outside.
get over here, over here,
down the street.
ask him if his phone barfed yet.
did your phone barf yet?
- phones are still working.
- cool.
keep going, and we'll
meet you in the backyard.
okay, copy that.
i'll take swift steps.
when i look back at that day,
i realize the clues
were all around us.
we had no idea.
dude, they all still work.
see?
dude, you know if this
whole thing works,
- these phones are done.
- no, i know.
i have 14 spares; it's okay.
- i bet you do.
- okay.
all right, anyways, let's spread out.
- okay.
- alex, go by the gate.
munch, go on the far end,
- yeah, i got it.
- and i'll stay right here by my camera.
- just watch out!
- okay, okay.
okay, it's good.
it's good...
it's good...
whoa, okay, it went out.
whoa, whoa, it barfed!
all right, people,
if you go to alex's house,
your phones will spew
chunks all over his screen.
my mom said the murphys' phones
and the churleys' changed, too.
so what do you think this is?
whoa!
these dudes.
hi.
- is that on?
- i don't know.
- maybe.
- oh.
we had an electrical
short over at the site,
and it may be disrupting
people's phone service,
and we're wondering if that happened
- to anybody in this house?
- oh, no, my phone is good.
- 'cause we're offering new phone vouchers
- uh-huh.
in exchange for any
device in this area here
- that may be displaying
- that's weird, that's weird.
- faulty messages or images?
- i don't know. see you.
no, listen, i...
okay, so you-you really don't think
this is a little bit weird?
these dudes come here
to build a freeway
- and now they want our phones?
- well, i think it's gonna work.
no. clean your room.
oh, my... i'm not gonna have
a room if we don't do something.
- right, i think...
- no, mom, seriously.
these guys want our houses.
maybe if we expose them
for illegal property, then...
- yo!
- aw, you don't like how things are, do you?
what are you gonna do about it, huh?
dude, it's a map to the desert.
like, what is that?
what do we do with this?
i guess most maps are
made to be followed.
exactly. it could go to, like,
some crazy headquarters,
and we find out
that these construction
clowns are spies
and we expose them to the world.
it's 20 miles away. what...
no, we're not... we're not gonna go.
no, obviously not.
look, whatever it is,
this saturday, we're going to sneak
behind our parents'
backs and find out.
i'm moving saturday.
all right, all right,
so friday night.
our last night together?
it doesn't have to be;
that's what i'm saying.
like, i don't want to move,
and these clowns are making us do it.
maybe we can stop them.
now, are you in?
yeah, all right.
- a ll right.
- i'm in.
munch, don't you bail out on us now.
dude, i'm not. me?
no... pfft! i'm in.
yeah! all right!
that's what i'm talking about,
that's what i'm talking
about, all right.
bring it in.
- oh, oops!
- munch!
so, why would you be
organizing your ketchups?
- because.
- who does that?
so i can get to them easier,
and then it's more organized,
- and it's better.
- and you are my friend.
guys, guys, it's time
to practice the big lie.
hey, mom, i'm spending
the night at alex's house
so we can play a neat,
brand-new video game.
and i'm sleeping over at tuck's house
so we can play a new video game.
and i'm sleeping in your mom's bed,
- not playing a video game.
- oh, my god, all right, dude.
stop talking about my
mother, thank you.
all right, the camera's
are gonna be on
dude, can you stop touching, please?
it attaches to my bike,
and it's also a pretty good way
to get footage on the fly.
spy glasses.
i love these; i love them.
and last, camera,
but definitely not least...
what up, camcorder?
keeping it tight.
looking pretty good these days.
tuck, these are the ugliest
things i've ever seen.
dude, what? what are you...
what are you talking about?
those are... they're sweet.
- the camera's undetectable,
- wow.
- and the ladies love them.
- prove it.
prove it?
this guy, all right?
give me my glasses, man.
those are stealth.
now i'm gonna prove to you guys
spy glasses get you girls.
oh, my gosh, he's going over there.
- i can't see who he's talking to.
- shut up, munch.
uh, hi, uh...
hey, um, em-emma, right?
emma?
i was just...
okay, uh, can i borrow a
piece of paper, please?
he has something.
- i can't see who he got it from.
- we're about to see right now.
look, look, look, look.
he has a paper.
you did not get her number.
totally got her number. right there.
you doubted me,
and my spy glasses worked.
you, too, you're a sellout.
no, uh-uh, you didn't
get emma's number.
yes, i did.
mannequin girl?
what kind of name is that?
what? that's what i call her.
i think mannequins are hot.
i'll leave my house at 6:00.
- munch, we'll get you at 6:30.
- yeah.
okay? tonight, we're no longer boys.
we're men.
- dude, what the...?
- i didn't see you, man.
tuck, you all right? let's go.
our whole lives
we've been nobodies.
in visible.
the good kids.
not anymore.
all right, ma.
i'm leaving.
spending the night at alex's house
so we can play a new video game.
have whatever you want, honey.
you know what, i lied, actually.
we're gonna ride our
bikes out into the desert
at night alone.
without supervision.
we got that; we're going to state.
okay, see you then, sweetie.
- we could go.
- also rob a bank.
- all the way. state.
- what?
go to mexico.
maybe even start a new life.
- right, i know.
- wrestling!
you're trying to act
like i don't know
what i'm talking about.
what's up, stumpy?
yo, man, i told you to
stop to calling me that.
you know what, man, look,
my girl's throwing this
huge party later tonight,
if you want to come by.
you serious?
yes, i'm serious.
because not a lady in
the world can resist
a natty old bmx bike.
what's the zero to 60
on that bad boy, huh?
two, three days?
come on, come on, dude, you ready?
let's go.
i can't even tell a difference.
this looks exactly the way
it looked before you packed.
all your stuff fitting in one box?
what are you, a drifter?
who told you?
look, all i'm saying is,
when you get to your
new house, put a poster up,
put some shelves on the
wall, frame a photo.
look, there's a painting right there.
put something on a shelf...
that's not a painting.
that looks like somebody just took
a bunch of dirt, smudged
it and called it art.
i'm going to munch's house to
play a video game, all right?
- okay.
- yeah, sure, buddy.
- bye, dylan.
- have fun with your friends.
- hey, hey, tuck.
- how are you?
uh, good luck with the
move to new york, buddy.
- maybe we'll come see you.
- all right, cool.
the moving truck is coming at 10:00.
make sure you're back, okay?
i-i don't get it.
if your foster parents already
have a baby of their own,
why do they need you?
there's no sense in
having two babies.
- shut up, dude.
- one baby cries all the time,
the other one listens to indie rock.
let's go.
yeow!
guys, would you please help my son
with his room, before i go crazy?
- yeah, yeah, sure.
- i don't think he's started...
honey, have you even
started packing your room?
i told you a thousand times,
i'm alphabetizing!
yo, let's scare him, let's scare him.
shh.
...they're flexible,
they're "dynamical,"
they can be curved, they can bend,
and this opens up a
whole new universe
of possibilities, and one
of the possibilities
is that there can be shortcuts
through space and through time.
so that's really just
what a wormhole is.
it's taking advantage...
what are you... aah!
- why don't you stop doing that?!
- i'm sorry!
you guys are gonna give me
a heart attack one day.
- i'm sorry.
- turn that off, dude.
i created a substation
for each of our parents' phones
that's wired to the router,
which is wired to the transmitter,
which transmits to the
receiver, which is...
- my phone.
- okay, so basically,
no matter who our parents
call, it goes to your phone.
yeah. my mom's friends always say
that i sound just like
my mom, you know,
- when i pick up the phone...
- yeah.
so i figured, i can be betty.
bye, betty. thank you.
um, i'm going to alex's...
or munch's... or tuck's house,
and we're gonna play a
video game and sleep over.
wait, what's all that stuff?
honey?
good job, munch. you did it.
here we come.
<i>going to the desert...</i>
munch, what are you doing?
guys, guys, just hold on,
hold on, hold on.
- dude...
- i'm not backing out or anything,
- he wants to quit right when we
- ...just-just hear me out.
- been waiting for this forever.
- dude, listen, come on, okay.
this is crazy what we're doing.
dude, i don't want to punk out
or back out or anything...
it's just, my mom, you know,
she just got divorced.
- munch...
- she's already had
enough guys lying to her.
if you didn't want to come,
then why didn't you tell us earlier?
you do understand this is
our last night together.
yeah, i know, i know.
look, munch, if we don't
go now, we'll never go.
we won't even be here.
this is our last chance
to try and do something.
even-even if it is stupid.
- yeah.
- you know what,
i say we put a vote to it.
all in favor raise your hand.
well, now i have to raise my hand.
munch, just...
fine, fine.
okay, whatever.
i'll go.
but only under one condition.
- i call the black!
- mine! no, no, give it!
it's so weird, no one's gonna be
in these houses next week.
dude, you're so full of it.
- when did you kiss her?
- dude, trust me.
after pre-algebra,
she pulled me into the bathroom.
wait, wait, wait, wait...
mannequin girl?
- yeah!
- was she good at it?
uh, eh, b minus.
you know, i've kissed
better in better locations.
no, how do i know you're not lying?
trust me. i don't even
have to reply to you.
- you're last!
- hey, you got a head start!
that's not fair!
oh, so what, there's a wing stop?
i never been to a wing stop.
we followed a map
out in the middle of nowhere.
it might be, like, a cia prison.
we were miles from home.
no one in the world knew it.
no one said it...
but we were scared.
we haven't seen a car
in, like, half an hour.
we were on our own.
this-this is the way, right?
you have the map, right?
- can i see the map?
- left.
left? are you sure?
because right looks a
little bit more promising.
did you guys hear that?
just a couple more miles.
hold on. what is that?
it's the map.
are we close?
i never understood why
people like the outdoors.
will you stop freaking out?
yo, this is too steep, man.
let's go, man.
we're getting pretty far
from the road, guys.
almost there.
is it this thing?
i don't think so.
wait, what was that?
- i don't know.
- well, hold on.
what'd you see, dude?
over here!
we're almost there. come on.
oh.
what?
what do you think it is?
how would i know?
why does it look all burnt?
hey, just be careful.
- careful!
- yeah, don't touch that thing. could be...
c-could be...
i don't know, i don't know.
a part of a satellite?
all right, all right, um,
munch, film me while i'm...
- while i'm touching this thing.
- yeah, yeah, absolutely.
let me try it. thank you.
it's dusty.
it's a piece of crap.
what?
forget about it.
just turn off the camera.
well, it's not a national treasure,
but it could be used for something.
it's crap.
what happened to filming
'cause it's our last night, huh?
um, in case you haven't
noticed, obviously,
the map led to squat.
got it. so all you cared about
was getting your stupid
hits on your stupid video?
- dude, why don't you just...
- whoa, guys, guys, guys.
come on! i know
we're all frustrated...
it's alex's mom.
- are you serious?
- um, it'll be fine.
just, um, be betty, okay?
- oh, man.
- oh, crap.
yo, i thought i could
do this, but i can't.
maybe you can answer it.
she just likes to check
up on things, okay?
all right.
betty, are you there?
go.
this is betty.
i was thinking maybe
i could bring over
some pizzas?
dude, go.
no, no, no, no, no.
no, no, no. no coming over.
- just hang up.
- no way.
no, it's really no trouble.
we have a coupon.
- i said no! no pizzas!
- what?
- no, uh...
- don't yell at her, man.
maybe you and your
husband should go to bed.
stop saying words!
are you sure everything's okay?
have a good night. go to sleep.
that could've gone better.
that was horrible.
"your husband should go to sleep"?
was that really
something smart to say?
munch.
don't look at me like i'm a hoarder.
that's rude.
who are they?
i don't... i don't know.
i'm picking up some
spikes in the readings...
get down, get down.
turn your flashlight off, dummy.
let's go.
why would they be out this far?
who cares?
the night's blown.
- aah! whoa, whoa, whoa!
- whoa, whoa.
munch?
- you're a character.
- there's something in there!
what?
dude, are you kidding me right now?
something is in that bag.
it-it touched me.
go check.
be-be careful.
- what?
- did it poke you, too?
what, dude? say something!
what did you see?
there-there's something in there.
yeah, a bunch of crap munch brought.
- you guys are funny.
- all i know is it beeped.
you know, why don't you
go in there and just see.
beeped? what are you talking about?
babies. i'll do it myself.
dang, how much stuff do you
have in your bag, dude?
geez.
oh, boy, are you guys
talking about this?
it's garbage. it's nothing.
what are you talking about,
you heard something?
it made a noise.
hey, hey, do something!
see, it's not doing anything.
what are you talking about?
beep.
do that again, do that again.
do what again?
do what you just did.
beep.
whoa, hold on. let me...
let me try this for myself.
beep.
beep?
why is it making noise
only for you and not me?
make it beep again.
beep.
whoa!
this is it! it's a bomb!
no, no, oh, god, no!
no, no, no!
guys, i think... i think
it might have defused.
i don't know.
man, nothing's happening.
all right, hold on, hold on.
i got an idea.
tuck!
what?
okay, it didn't do anything,
but j-just don't do it again.
are you insane, tuck?!
are you sure you guys
know what you're doing?
yes, trust me.
when it's a bomb,
you have to act quick.
i seen it on some tv show
or some movie or something.
- saw what?
- check it out.
what are you doing?!
disarming it.
are you crazy?!
it's a bomb; that's what
you're supposed to do.
that's not what you do with a bomb!
are you insane?!
what was that?
it's not my phone.
it's the thing, whatever that is.
- what are you talking about?
- it's that.
that's what just made that noise.
i, uh... it, like,
imitated my ringtone.
this is what made our phones barf?
did you hear that?
all right, so, a couple
of seconds ago,
our phones went crazy.
bananas, insane.
i don't know what to call it. look.
you see that?
it's a new map,
but on my phone this time.
to me? all right, him, or...
dude, munch's phone got
all weird hieroglyphics
and, ugh, i don't even
know what that is.
alex's phone, it just
turned on by itself
and started filming.
we can't even turn them off.
oh, don't try to act
like it's not cool.
that is weird.
it's showing us where we are.
and you don't find that creepy?
what do you think that is?
you think that's a road?
we should follow the map.
how about no.
how about yes?
we wanted a last night together,
so what do you call this?
a trap?
didn't you guys see the
"no trespassing" sign?
oops. i didn't see anything.
this is where the map says to go.
stop stepping on leaves.
there's leaves everywhere.
shh.
what was that?
where do you think it's taking us to?
maybe another one of
those beepy things.
what was that?
i don't know.
- whoa! whoa!
- get down!
oh, geez!
munch, watch out!
aah! aah!
aah!
what's going on?
dude, munch, what was that?
where is it?
is it over?
oh, geez.
dude!
tuck, stay back.
- whoa.
- stay back.
what's...
dude!
wait, wait, be careful.
your phone just got a new map.
what?
- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- wait, why is it opening?
hold on, hold on.
did you see that just now?
what is that?
- whoa! what is that?
- what is that?
- what is that?
- oh, my...
dude, move, you're blocking my shot.
it-it's moving.
there's something in there right now.
what's in there?
oh, don't tell me.
are those... eyes?
dude, dude, it's looking
dead at us right now.
oh, god, oh, god, oh, god.
it's trembling like it's hurt.
good.
my heart's beating so fast right now.
wow.
almost got us killed, like,
three times already.
yeah, but it was worth it, dude.
incredible.
all right, so...
i just figured out why alex's
camera was on this whole time.
so this thing, whatever it is,
it's eyes are, like,
all screwed up, completely.
you see?
so, basically, it uses
his phone to see.
that's insane.
you think he can see us right now?
munch, you have to check this out.
this is amazing.
is it?
is it amazing?
'cause i think it's scary as balls.
i mean, obviously people
are looking for it.
- munch...
- it has access to our voicemails
and our texts and our ringtones.
how do you even know it's a he?
are you a dude?
wait...
you understood us.
whoa.
all right, here's how it goes.
one beep is yes, two beeps are no.
watch.
is one beep yes?
yo, that's so tight.
are we in a barn?
is munch really a woman?
oh, come on, man,
this thing is broken.
everybody knows munch is a woman.
okay, i have a question.
are we gonna die tonight?
why isn't it answering?
what...
well, that's not good, right?
tuck simms exclusive.
- let's do this.
- check it out.
all right, um, are you from space?
ooh!
are you a robot?
do you eat humans?
do you like earth?
why? why doesn't he like earth?
do you like us?
you see? i told you.
we're cool like that.
come on.
are you hurt?
- oh.
- he's hurt.
well, his lights seem brighter, so...
did that piece help you?
oh.
can we help fix you or something?
or... like, what is this?
are-are you trying
to build something?
oh, he's trying to build...
building something. right there.
- what could he be building?
- yeah.
so, wait, what are,
what are you building?
lasers?
a portal?
minions?
a cloaking device?
it's an army.
ignore him.
spaceship?
oh, my god!
hold up, hold up.
so let me get this right.
so you're building a spaceship,
- he's building a spaceship.
- and you need our help
building the spaceship?
oh, man.
this guy is building a spaceship.
hold up, hold up, hold up.
let me make sure i
don't have any plans.
nope! we're building a spaceship!
he's building a spaceship.
we asked him questions
for almost two hours.
where he came from.
if there were others here like him.
we found out he was lost...
and alone.
he was out in the middle of nowhere,
on his own,
like us.
all we really knew
was that he crashed,
and now he needed us to rebuild him.
the map says up ahead.
are we going the right way?
look, look, look, look,
whatever that is,
the map goes to it.
all right, so wait-wait a minute.
let me get this right.
dude comes from a million
light-years away,
and he wants to come here?
i don't know, the map said so.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
you got to look both ways
before you cross the street.
munch.
so are you... snoopy.
ten dollars?
- i said no deal.
- $7.50.
i don't want it.
it's tchotchke trash.
if you give it to me as a gift,
i'd still throw it away.
- it's trash.
- no, it's vintage.
no. you don't get to say
the word "vintage."
i'm the one who gets to
say when what is vintage.
excuse me, sir, you have
a very, very lovely shop.
come on, you sure?
hey.
oh, man, look at the hand painting.
it's all crafted right there.
- one of a kind.
- it's trash.
uh, uh...
what was that?
f-sharp?
no, no, no! come on!
watch out! watch out!
what was it?
whoa. is everybody okay?
hey, nichols, are you alive?
they broke my girlfriend's lamp!
wait, what is he doing?
- oh. whoa, whoa.
- is-is that...
sweet babushka.
you want to sell it?
- tuck, let's go! come on!
- run! what are you waiting for?
dude, that place was wrecked!
sorry again, sir!
go! go! down here!
let's get somewhere
so we can look at him.
he's shaking.
whoa, he's letting you touch him.
- i wouldn't, guys.
- hey, what about here?
here, set him on here.
he looks scared.
yeah, why is he all balled up?
can't you stand?
you all right?
maybe he's...
maybe he's just shy.
- ooh, can you fly?
- can you do x-ray vision?
how? he can't see.
he doesn't even know where to look.
all right, all right,
i think the question is,
what can you do?
okay, so dr. nichols is
doing a surgical procedure
with very sophisticated technology.
pen caps.
clear.
wait, i don't get it.
how is that sophisticated?
it's kind of just, like, pen caps.
i got it.
be careful. his legs are fragile.
get this. are you getting this?
oh, that's crazy!
so you can't fly,
but you can float.
that is so crazy!
i saw you. i saw you grinning, man.
stop trying to pretend
like that wasn't cool.
- that was hot.
- this is crazy.
i mean, it's-it's just crazy.
whoa. don't drop it.
huh.
can you see me?
huh, i think he likes you.
will you show us where you live?
all right.
beep faster if i'm getting close.
is that it, right there?
why don't i go first.
hi. um, my name's alex, and...
you're-you're in... munch, no...
you're in my hand right now.
you know my ringtone, which is,
like, insane and awesome.
okay, um...
hi.
i'm tuck.
what's up?
i don't even know what
to say, but, uh...
but, uh, i'm from...
i'm from new york.
uh, this is nevada.
i don't even know,
like, i like donuts,
- um...
- donuts? really?
okay, can somebody else do this?
i know, i'm going. my name's m...
my real name is reginald,
but my friends call me munch.
i hope we can be friends, too.
do you have a name?
oh, we could call him beep.
dude, what-what kind of name is beep?
word. we got to give him a
name that's powerful, like...
like master blaster.
he doesn't blast anything.
peter. peter. what about peter?
something cool, like space
ninja or something.
well, how is there a ninja in space?
he wouldn't be able to breathe.
- all right, all right...
- dude, you don't know that.
have you ever been to space?
which name do you like?
uh, beep. why?
there it is.
- hello. watch this. watch this.
- you can't echo...
watch this. just...
beep.
see?
echo.
that's what we should call it. echo.
- oh, 'cause it echoes.
- wait, i don't get it.
- echo, echo, echo.
- echo.
your name...
is echo.
echo... echo...
i don't think he's supposed
to come out of that cylinder thing.
he looks... dead.
echo?
so then we didn't know
how broken he was.
the crash hurt him
worse than we thought.
okay, little guy...
where do you want us to go?
guys?
you know this is considered
being a burglar, right?
with each new piece,
he got strong.
and that's what we were
gonna do... make him stronger.
- which way?
- around.
- in the house?!
- dude!
maybe we should just
knock on the door and...
we just need you to
listen, sweetheart.
- oh, man.
- you're grounding me?
tuck, what are you doing? munch, go.
it's the man... the man should
choose his dance partner.
it's a stupid tradition.
really, it's about
meeting new people,
and many of those were
our friends' sons.
and it's embarrassing
when you ignore them.
and these are life skills
that we are teaching you.
- tuck, get back.
- putting on this dress for you
doesn't change me into some
perfect little homecoming queen!
okay, no one's asking you to
act like a homecoming queen.
it's at least three years away.
now. go, go, go.
...by the company you keep.
it's a cliché for a reason.
i'm sure this all seems...
guys, what are we doing?
we're gonna be trapped up here.
everybody be quiet.
yeah, everyone!
you got to be kidding me.
aw, you know what?
everyone just follow me, all right?
don't look at anything. just hurry.
- hey, tuck, did you see this?
- no, don't...
dude, tuck, this is
mannequin girl's house.
now we can ask for
permission to steal stuff,
'cause, you know,
you guys are kissing buddies.
aw, man...
it was a couple of days ago.
she probably forgot about
it by now, you know?
like, yeah, it's... yeah,
she probably forgot.
- how would she forget about it?
- i almost forgot about it...
- oh, boy, get ready.
- uh-oh.
close the door. close the door.
dude, we just got to keep it
from going crazy.
it's gonna get loud.
we'll catch it in a blanket.
- what?
- whoa!
- get down! whoa! whoa! whoa!
- stop letting it move!
oh, god, oh, god, oh, god!
how to unfold a napkin?!
- who cares!
- fine!
and in no time in my life
am i gonna be somewhere
- that even plays the foxtrot!
- close the door.
yo, put it away, man.
shh. be quiet.
what the...?
wait, i know you.
hey. it's okay.
hey, hey, hey, we're with tuck.
tuck simms. you know?
remember you guys kissed?
- we what?
- yeah, what are you talking about, huh?
why is my room destroyed?
why are you filming this?
- and what is that?
- um, it's a...
it's a-a car muffler.
no. i want to know what that is.
it's actually a spaceship.
- munch!
- sorry. uh, well,
we-we were following maps,
and it just happened
to lead here, so we were trying
to help our friend echo...
well, he's an alien
- oh, god...
- ...that we're trying to get him on a ship.
see, look, it used to have six symbols,
but now it has three, so that means
we're almost there. crazy, right?
munch, will you shut up?
an alien came to earth
to give you guys maps?
- nope.
- no, no.
- you did not just see that.
- yeah, i did.
yeah, she definitely saw it.
- wait.
- whoa, whoa.
- hey, i want to go.
- really? sounds great.
what? no.
- dude...
- you're not part of our group,
so why don't you just go play
with your super rich friends...
that's kind of harsh...
and your ball gowns and just
go eat steak or something.
- what the hell?
- go, go, go.
dang, dude, what was that upstairs?
- what are you talking about?
- i've never seen you so mad.
yeah, dude, you did kind of snap.
all right, let's just...
don't talk about...
nothing happened in there, all right?
you know, they say the
girls you argue with
are the ones you like.
don't go there, bro.
tuck, it's over there.
wait, it wants us to go to a bar?
man, i say we climb in a
window or find a door.
there's got to be another way.
um, before-before we go...
i really need to get
the pee out of my body.
let's just hope the
next place isn't a bank.
i can't believe you told
that girl to get lost.
- you're so dramatic.
- what about you?
you invented a whole
kiss, didn't you?
uh, first of all, for your info,
it's called aspirational thinking.
you're thinking it one moment,
you're living it the next.
- how's that working out?
- oh, excuse me.
go to the bikes.
oh, god, oh, god.
- why is the construction man...
- shut...
- excuse me.
- aw...
hey.
i know you guys.
you're the guys... you're from
the construction site, right?
uh, with the, uh, with the camera?
whoa-ho, wait, wait.
why aren't you guys
at home right now?
you guys weren't riding your bikes
out around the desert, were you?
- no, of course not.
- yes.
uh, no.
that doesn't sound too... clear.
- uh...
- thank god. there you are.
- what?
- who-who are you?
who am i?
who am i? exactly!
it's like i don't even know anymore.
my mom had to drag my
dad from the bar... again!
- what?
- he likes to go there
more than he likes to tuck
in his own kids at night.
at least that's what my mom says.
what's she talking about?
that's her.
eating a burrito.
she east when she's stressed.
i ask myself if that's
gonna be me one day.
what do you think? is it?
we make mistakes and we get married
and we go to bars.
and these... these are my
only friends in the world,
- 'cause they see me
- uh...
for who i really am.
that's your mom over there?
- do you want to meet her?
- no. no. no, no.
just get home safe!
told you guys i wanted to go.
what the...?
okay, so this girl, man,
she'd been tailing us
since her house,
spying on us like
some creepy stalker.
- she'd overheard our whole plan.
- she... she's crazy.
- i need the bag!
- i think i like it.
oh, boy, get ready.
all right, try to blend in. look old.
that must've been
some good fake i.d.'s.
what's up, baby face?
what are you doing
in here, little man?
oh, uh, i, uh...
- are you randy's kid?
- uh,
- yes, he is.
- um, y-yeah, yeah,
yeah, he's my dad... or mom.
- you know, dad. mom.
- okay, dude, just go.
hurry up.
emma? emma?
i was hanging out with
this really pretty chick.
she's almost as pretty
as you. i mean...
you're not pretty.
i mean, you are pretty.
come over here. hop up on that stool.
get him a shirley temple.
oh, and one for his buddy here, too.
no, no, i'm all right.
seriously, i'm all right.
- sure, you'll like it.
- sorry, i'm a... i'm allergic.
oh, you're gonna love it.
- uh, no, no.
- you're gonna get one.
so, what happens next?
- just give me back my bag.
- no.
give it. i'm serious.
give me the bag.
why are you being mean to me?
- here, honey.
- thank you.
- you're welcome.
- yeah.
wow, a lot of people with beards
and mustaches in here, you know?
you don't understand.
whenever you get close
to the next piece, it goes crazy.
oh, my god!
whoa! aah!
- uh...
- are you kidding me?
do you guys just go around
town breaking stuff?
just keep running! go, go!
what was that?
i think the ship's
trying to take off!
are you seeing this?
this thing is flying a ship...
in your backpack?
i think he's getting better.
oh.
so, you don't know how
he crashed, or when,
or why he came here with a
spaceship in the first place?
look, he only answers yes
or no... it's not that simple.
is this how i talk to him?
so, you crashed.
did someone cause you to crash?
dude, what's she doing?
- i don't know.
- someone on earth?
do you think they're looking for you?
it's not those guys in trucks
from the convenience store, is it?
the construction man?
those are the guys
that shot you down?
wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.
we got to take a step back.
this is way bigger and
shadier than before, okay?
this is not good.
if those dudes are looking for echo,
they're looking for us, you know?
echo?
you need some help there, buddy?
hey, it's okay. shh.
breathe like me, okay?
it's okay.
dude, h-he'll be fine.
no. we're not leaving him.
my whole life, i've been left.
i know how it feels.
we're all he's got.
- uh, left?
- we could find a shortcut.
the map says up ahead.
this map's confusing.
i was a mind ninja back there...
- so, what was it like kissing me?
- give me my camera.
did your legs get all wobbly?
was there soft music playing?
please remind me, tuck.
i totally forgot.
- what was it like?
- you're close.
is this your first imaginary kiss?
the map says for us to go inside.
i'm confused.
- huh?
- didn't you guys kiss?
anyway, the point is,
emma was being annoying...
she kept walking off
with echo like she owned him,
and talking to him about
i don't know what, i don't even know.
you know what? delete.
man, are we sure there's
no security guards or...
you know, that door
wasn't even locked.
hey, uh, guys, i was
just thinking, you know,
i... haven't got to actually
hold the, you know, the ship,
before we did the
thing, so can i do it?
- you know, before it gets crazy?
- sure, but...
it's not a ship.
what? what are you talking about?
he told us it was a ship.
it's a key to your ship, right?
well, if this is just the key,
where's the spaceship?
all right, munch, put it down.
okay, dude, no, i got it, i got it.
okay, i'm not asking you,
i'm telling you to put it down
- before you hurt both of us.
- i need this, man.
that's weird.
- does it know her?
- i don't know. munch!
whoa!
whoa!
you okay?
- yeah.
- what are you guys doing?
- wow.
- um, she was gonna get hit
by the piece, so i-i saved her.
hey! you four! freeze!
- run!
- which way?
- tuck!
- stop right there! stop!
go, go! hurry up!
hold up, hold up! did alex get out?
uh, i d... i don't know.
- we have to go back.
- uh...
- come on, you guys.
- okay.
look. whoa, whoa. she's being stupid.
there's a guard in there, you know?
you can't just go
running in, acting crazy.
we need a-a plan, or...
s... right?
breaking and entering,
destruction of property.
those are felonies, kid.
okay, echo, i need your help.
um, i need you to... do something.
i have a minor here; he's 13.
caught him breaking
in with his friends.
if you could send an officer down.
stay put.
hello?
anybody there?
hello?
hello?
is anybody there?
...there...
is anybody there... there...
whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa!
alex. alex.
- wh-where's tuck?
- we got to go.
- we should've gone back.
- all right, you know what?
calm down, because if people
would've listened to me,
then alex never would
have gotten caught.
didn't i say there would
be security guards?
alex! dude!
you're all right! are you all right?
hey, alex, we're good,
man. all right?
- buddy?
- we're good, man?
alex.
come on, dude.
alex!
we could've gone home, but we didn't.
- we were outside.
- turn off the camera.
not till you admit you're
acting mopey for no reason.
you're always freaking out if
anyone's gonna leave you behind.
do you know how expensive that is?
i'm glad i'm moving.
you were never my friend.
- is that right? is that right?
- guys, guys,
- come on, just-just chill out.
- come on!
have you lost your mind?
i acted like i didn't
know what i'd done.
but i knew exactly.
i know we're all tired
and stuff, and hungry.
i saw this awesome diner.
we can totally just go grab
- a bite to eat or something.
- real awesome, guys.
real macho.
so, that's it?
the night's over?
doesn't have to be.
right?
well, i mean, if it is,
uh, we could...
i don't know, i guess we can
keep the mood going, yeah?
or we can do it another time, right?
good times,
the continuation, part two.
right?
hmm.
you know what?
i'm gonna talk about sandra.
man, that girl used to
beat the crap out of you.
me, too.
we were both little,
small and scrawny.
she was a big girl, and she knew it.
but then i had a growth spurt,
and you didn't, and i
finally did something.
you remember that?
you told her i had polio.
yeah, i told her that, and did
she beat you up after that?
she still beat me up.
'cause i-i always get your back, man.
i never let you down;
i always get your back.
most of the time.
just when i'm not freaked out
about security guards, all right?
i'm sorry, man.
are we good?
yeah.
dude.
faster.
sure are doing some
traveling tonight.
my parents are in the bathroom.
uh-huh.
let it go.
what are you doing?
- dude! hey, what are you doing?!
- oh, god!
don't grab our stuff like that!
- stop!
- hey, give me the backpack!
- who do you think you are?
- the police have been instructed
to come and pick up these
kids and take them home.
he can't just walk away.
what was it?
- the phone.
- no, no, no!
- munch!
- munch!
- munch! munch!
- munch!
munch!
oh, my... munch!
this is not real, this is not real,
this is not real right now.
don't let them see you.
now!
munch!
do you see the truck?
munch!
munch!
that guy is not a
construction worker.
- it's munch.
- i need help, guys.
i really didn't think this through.
we're here, we're here. are you hurt?
can you guys hear me...?
- are you okay?
- where are you, munch?
we'll find you, all right? i promise.
i think i'm at the construction site.
- come on, buddy.
- munch!
i can see the big lights
and up at those...
the white trucks...
how far is your neighborhood?
it's way over an hour.
all right, i think i
got a faster way.
who wants to go to a party?
are you sure he'll even be here?
better be.
his girlfriend's throwing it.
i can't believe we're doing this.
sophomores.
hey, sweet party. sweet jams.
guys, what are we
doing here? we can't be...
just look for my brother.
look for his keys.
- oh, my gosh, it's the cops.
- okay.
oh, god, the keys, the keys.
i lost my keys.
i have a porsche.
marcus! oh, not you, sorry.
i wasn't trying to stop
the fun... i like it.
whoa...!

cops take the footage.

cops are gone.
- uh, tuck, tuck?
- i have no idea where marcus is.
yeah.

my name is reginald "munch" barrett.
this is my... kind of
my final message.
to my best friends...
i love you, guys.
you're googling it? really?
oh, come on, this is what
the internet is for.
um, "step one,
get a driver's license."
- do we have one of those?
- oh, wow.
all right, am i good?
stop! stop!
all right, all right.
dude, do you even know
what you're doing?
no, i don't.
"step two, be calm."
what are you doing?!
- sorry, sorry.
- be calm is step two?
all right, all right, all right.
i got it, i got it.
hold on a sec..
- stop!
- tuck, tuck, turn!
- whoa!
- oh, i'm sorry about that.
- uh...
- oh, my god.
we're good, we're good.
all right, i'm excited.
should i gun it?
- no, no, no, don't.
- no, tuck.
i need, i need music.
somebody just play some music.
all right.
- oh, my!
- oh, my god.
change it.
everywhere we'd been that night,
shot by us like a rocket.
all we wanted was our friends back.
i'm gonna miss it here, man.
yeah, me too.
here we go.
i don't know about this.
did you hear that?
yeah.
that does not look like a freeway.
get down.
shh, shh.
all right, so what's the plan?
i don't know. get him out?
so, in other words,
we don't have a plan.
go, go, go.
i'm just gonna call munch's phone
and see if his phone rings.
wait a minute.
dude, my camera's not a doorstop.
i hear his voice.
shh.
i-i knew it was you guys
'cause i saw the same truck
from my neighborhood.
tell us the truth.
i-i had a lot of adrenaline rush,
and... i...
i didn't want the night to end.
and i... and it was the
last night with alex.
oh, shit, munch.
stop crying and talk to us.
this is not good.
i'm not... i'm not crying!
what? where is that?
we got to find him and
get him out of there, man.
just don't kill me!
did he access your phones at all?
were there others like it or was
this the only one you found?
what are they doing?
dude, they're breaking him!
guys?
guys, someone's coming. we should go.
go, go.
- hey, hey, hey!
- hey, construction man!
- give me the camera.
- listen...
this is not your camera.
hey, guys, go!
- and find munch!
- let go of me!
get off of us, man, this isn't...
- my camera!
- let go.
is that thing still on?
okay, no more lies.
no more sneaking around.
no more cameras, understand?
son, look at me.
look at me.
oh, i-i see better
with my glasses on,
you know?
this signal has been transmitting
for a very long time,
from a ship that we believe
is located right here
in your neighborhood.
- what?
- wait, what's he talking about?
six days ago,
an object entered our atmosphere
at 20,000 miles an hour,
on a direct course for that ship.
we shot it down.
what you found activates the ship,
and if that ship takes off,
it could kill everyone.
he just wants to go home.
okay, that will not happen.
he is far too valuable.
this is crazy, this is crazy.
so...
we are gonna follow this map
and you are gonna help us
get that thing operational,
and it will lead us back to its ship,
and we will disable it permanently.
am i clear?
am i clear?
y-yeah.
good.
check the doors, check the doors.
it's locked; it's not just locked.
they don't have a handle on it.
- someone help!
- where are they taking us?
hey, yo!
let us out, man!
someone!
well, the sun's up.
our parents are gonna find out.
i think we got bigger
problems than our parents.
where are we?
let's go!
all right, everybody knows the drill.
let's set it up.
- he's not moving.
- stop!
can you see me?
beep?
we're all here.
we're gonna get you home, all right?
we'll find a way.
nichols, man, it's not there.
no.
please, you have to work.
just try.
echo?
don't!
echo!
you can't go; you can't!
it's over.
let's keep them quiet.
come on, man. it's...
it's time to go.
what's happening?
what is that?
here he goes.
back up. get ready.
whoa.
okay, now!
where are we going?
home! his ship's in mulberry woods.
dude, go!
how do i drive?
will you drive?!
please drive! just hurry up!
alex, dude, you don't
have your seat belt on!
- just speed up!
- just go!
go, go, go, go, go!
they're right there!
you have to speed!
- i'm trying!
- you're driving...!
- oh, god, oh, god, oh, god!
- tuck, you're gonna
get us killed!
- where do i go?
- just go around them.
- no, hold on.
- don't go on the wrong side!
dude, stop, stop!
- oh!
- what the...?
- oh, my gosh.
- whoa, whoa!
are you... are you seeing this?
thanks, buddy.
i need an advil.
we can't afford this right now.
we really can't afford
this right now.
dude, look, there's a new map.
a what?
here, here, give me the phones back.
i think that's his ship.
whoa, that's a big ship.
alex, i don't want to
stress you out or anything,
but they're right there!

- munch, it's your mom.
- what?!
look, look, look, look. dude.

had this conversation?
uh, uh, just come over this wall.
are you up?
- guys, they're here.
- jump.
- move!
- faster!
they can't catch us
in our own backyard.
let's cut them off.
munch, hurry up!
- okay, okay.
- munch!
well, i don't jump
walls very much, man!
here, hold my camera.
dude, come on, come on, come on.
- no, no, no, no, no!
- tuck, wait!
they're right behind us!
come on, guys, we got
to go, we got to go.
let's go, right now.
it's down the hill.
come on, let's go!
shh.
go, go, go.
it says the ship is up ahead.
this is the way to your house, man.
- go, go, go, guys!
- are your parents awake?
i think we...
i think we lost them.
okay.
i don't... i don't get it.

dude, what? whoa, whoa.
whoa! whoa, whoa, whoa!
- whoa, whoa...
- oh.
everybody good?
what's down there?
be careful, man.
what?
that's it.
dude, it-it's underneath.
so this whole time...
that's why they want all our houses.
they were digging.
yo, alex, i know
what you're thinking.
alex!
alex, man!
th-the only way that
thing can take off
is to come up out of
the ground through us.
that's a really bad idea.
dude, what are you doing?
this is not just about us anymore.
it's about other people now,
a whole community still
asleep in their beds.
let's just think this through first.
- i trust him.
- listen to us.
alex! alex! alex!
is this where we're supposed to be?
make up a plan.
- no, we got to run.
- what are you talking about?
- if the ship's right under...
- we can't leave.
- i know we can't leave him.
- what about alex?
what about everyone up
here that's gonna die?
alex!
dude, say something!
oh, my god.
i left you behind once.
i'm not doing it again.
hi, guys.
whoa.
whoa.
this...
this is in-insane.
so, um, beep.
uh, um,
i don't really know
how to say good-bye...
so i'm not gonna.
and, um...
um...
you're my friend, you know?
even when i'm old,
even when... even when
you think i've forgotten...
i'm always gonna be there.
do you feel that?
whoa, whoa, whoa!
guys, we need to go now!
we have to go.
bye.
go, go, go!
wait, wait, wait, my camera!
are you okay?
- yeah, yeah.
- dude, are you all right?
- everybody good?
- are you all right? okay.
that was so close.
what the heck?
- oh, my...
- what the...?
yeah!
oh, my god.
dude, this is amazing.
i think you're gonna
want to get this.
oh!
we did it, dude.
we did it.
dude!
did you see that?
did you see...
- wow. we did that!
- you're like...
that's insane. we just did that!
that's... look, come on.
look, look, people want
to know what happened.
if we told them what happened,
they wouldn't believe us.
guys,
it's morning.
oh, crap, i gotta get home.
- my dad is gonna kill me.
- i think i need a ride.
we should go because people,
they'll start asking...
hey, buddy... did you guys
feel that earthquake?
- were you okay?
- no, mom, i'm fine.
- let me see.
- he's fine. honey, he's fine.
did no one just see
the giant spaceship?!
- oh, my god!
- yeah, a spaceship.
what just happened?!
oh, oh, okay, okay.
i know it's been really hard lately,
- and we've all been really overwhelmed.
- just...
why don't we... why don't
we just go in and relax.
maybe we can, um, go get
that-that pizza we talked about.
- all right? yeah.
- pizza?
- if we don't play along,
- yeah, his mom saw the ship.
- nobody's gonna get it okay?
- how could i play along?
- so just...
- yes, i'm sure.
i found them here at alex's.
yeah, yeah.
uh, no, no.
actually, uh, we found him here.
i thought he was staying with you.
no, i was told they were at munch's.
i'll call you back, babe.
yeah, yeah, they were at my house.
we-we played this game
where you play as a guy
with the soul of a dragon,
and it had really good voices.
the voices were great, so...
who's this?
that's emma.
i'm, uh, he's my boyfriend.
i mean, friend who's a boy.
- um...
- awkward.
she's hot, right?
knock it off, you.
six hours later, alex moved.
i just got grounded for, like, life.
me, too.
might as well move now.
not gonna be seeing
anyone for a while.
yeah.
but this...
what really happened tonight...
no one knows but us.
hey, alex!
time to go, buddy.
i'm gonna miss you guys.
you guys smell really bad.
our last night together,
we did a lot.
a whole lot.
but there's some
things we couldn't do.
alex's parents had already
bought a new home.
most of the neighborhood had.
munch's, too.
so, one by one,
people started to move.
my parents hadn't,
so we got to stay.
new people started moving in,
and mulberry wood started again,
but not the one that
had my friends in it.
when you're a kid,
you think you're invisible.
you think you can't
make a difference.
we're not kids anymore.
we know now...
that we can do anything.
having a friend light-years
away taught us
that distance is just
a state of mind.
if you're best friends,
then you always will be...
no matter where you
are in the universe.
