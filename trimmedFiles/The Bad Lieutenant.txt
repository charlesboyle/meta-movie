aggravated assault,
narcotics, and possession of automatic weapons.
we believe he's also behind

possible witnesses.
godshaw has two flunkies
that he runs with.
deshaun hackett,

maybe we'll get
lucky he'll turn up.

if his laying low
chances are, that's where we'll find him.
let's bring him in.

we don't need you no
more. there's gonna be five homicides
and donald's gonna
hand them on you.
he gets eight to ten.
you get for life.
i don't know nobody
named "midget".
i don't know nobody
named "big fate."
renaldo hayes!
oh. man!
that's bad luck.
i keep hope that once
in a while this kid throws to somebody on his own team.
i love the guy. by the end
of the fucking game, i'm starting to hate him.
what do you want
for the weekend?
what's the spread on
louisiana-arkansas?
four.
louisiana.
minus to four
for a dime.
you got it. i got
a favor to ask.
my kid got
a speeding ticket.
i'll take care if you
give me half a point.
you're gonna grind me
for helping out my kid?
grind you?
you're funny guy, you know that?
there's guys getting half
a point on the street for nothing. grind you.
all right.
but you take care of it.
hello. hello!
i'm lieutenant mcdonagh,
new orleans homicide.
what can i do for you?
a friend of mine's daughter
got written up for speeding.
she was doing 75
on the way to the hospital to visit her grandmother.
has a couple of minor,
minor violations in the past.
she's in danger
of losing her license.
what do you
want me to do?
i'd like you to take
care of it for me.
you come to the scene
of an accident to ask me that?
there shouldn't
be a problem.
are you asking me to break
the law? is that what you're doing here?
i'm asking you
one cop to another to do me a favor.
the answer's no.
just like that?
just like that.
is this the same police
department my father was in?
you'll excuse me.
great.
guardian of the flame,
right? fucking ass.
get back in you
car, lieutenant.
or else what?
hey there.
hey, what are
you doing here?
you know the lieutenant?
yeah. we used
to work together.
why don't you walk him
back to his car?
i could've told you
not to bother with that asshole.
you needed a ticket
fixed, why didn't you come to me?
i didn't know
you worked here.
they only let me out
on patrol when they're short handed.
mostly they got me
in the property room.
property room?
what are you
doing tonight?
you asking me out?
yes, i am.
[laughs]
hey.
you like these
boots, don't you?
only on you,
you know that.
yeah?
you're horny?
oh, yeah.
no, you're not.
you're high on dope.
not true.
whatever i take
is prescription.
except for the heroin.
hey! wake up, mcdonagh.
yeah, there's times
i can't get what i need with the prescription.
really?
yeah. when my back
hurts sometimes.
well, maybe there's
something i can do to make that pain go away.
you definitely can.
what's that, baby?
what do you want me to do for you?
check out your
property room
and see if there's
any oxycontin
or morphine
you can sneak
outta there.
just make sure
you get rid of the voucher copy.
you're nuts.
hey.
the ticket's gonna be a
little more complicated than i thought.
you're kidding me.
the best thing to do
is to have her plead not guilty.
by the time a court day
comes around, i'll talk to the cop who wrote her up.
i thought that's what
you were gonna do.
i went straight
to the lieutenant.
he wound up being
a hard on.
it'll work out.
it's just gonna take a little longer. come on.
kinda calls into question the
half-a-point-for-nothing concept, don't you think?
you're some cheap
prick, you know that?
you say you're gonna
do something and you don't do it.
good! charge me
for the half point.
and after last weekend,
you're down $3,000.
you might,
i mean, might
have thought to bring me
a little something.
two dimes!
on louisiana
against georgia.
okay, you got it.
[flushes toilet]
how long has he
been in there?
about 20 minutes.
who else?
his girlfriend.
at least one. that's as far as we know.
what are these fucking
iguanas doing on my coffee table?
there ain't no iguana.
yeah, there are.
there ain't no iguana.
what the fuck is that?
fucking iguana.
are we set up?
swat's around
the corner.
no! no, just,
just no swat. let them stay there.
the duty captain said
he wanted to coordinate with us when we--
is that what you're fucking
doing now? reporting back to the duty captain?
i'm telling you
what he said.
if we need swat,
we'll call 'em.
let's go.
who else is in here?
nobody.
we're gonna come back
every day, you understand?
more times we come back,
more chances that child getting shot.
ain't nobody here.
[whispers]
he's hiding back there in the armoire.
you all stay
with her. armand.
get up.
i said get up!
damn, man.
it's always nice to see
an intact family.
a father who honors
his obligations
as far as his
children are a concern.
you're here.
that's important thing.
you may be hiding in
an armoire, but your child knows you're here.
are you tripping, man?
armand, give us
a minute.
you're tripping.
you want that shit.
shut the door.
shut up. shut the door.
sit down.
sit down, sit down.
[exhales]
now we can talk.
you don't mind
if i light one up, do you?
fuck, man.
i find it relaxes me.
what the fuck, man?
you know we got
your boy, "g." right?
man, i don't know no "g."
he knows you.
it's amazing how much
you can get done
when you've got
a simple purpose guiding through life.
my purpose is
to find out
who shot up this
apartment on josephine.
i know the guy who
was living there was from senegal.
i know he was
selling heroin.
i know whose territory
he was stepping on.
and i know who went
over to the apartment to straighten him out.
i found out all that
in the past few days.
where is
"big fate," son?
i don't know
no "big fate."
you see, i know
that's not true.
'cause everybody who comes
from where you come, knows who "big fate" is.
the fact that you're lying
to me, tells me you're hiding something.
you know my only reason for
being here is to find out who shot up the apartment.
i know that's what
you're hiding. see? it all,
all comes back
to that same simple purpose.
man, i ain't
telling you shit.
[dog barks]
[dog barks]
hey.
what's wrong?
your father's mad at me
'cause i can't take care of his fucking dog.
why does he need you
to take care of it?
'cause he's going
back into aa.
he says he can't
do with any more responsibilities.
besides that he,

he's a witness
to a homicide.

to five homicides.
let's go.
where are we going?
to find him.

binnie, call security.
nobody's calling anybody.
where's your
grandson, binnie?
i don't have
to tell you anything.
yeah, you do.
i haven't done anything.
my grandson hasn't done anything.
if he doesn't wanna be
a witness, he doesn't have to be a witness.
this is bigger
than one, two.
this was a massacre.
children
were executed.
maybe you should've
thought of that before.
i need to know
where he is.
young man, i would like
to know the name of your superior.
right now i'm working
on about an hour and a half sleep
over the past
three days.
and i'm still trying
to remain courteous.
and i'm beginning to think
that that's getting in the way of my being effective.
what are you doing?
what--what
are you doing?
i wanna know
where daryl is.
my god.
nobody saw me
come in. nobody knows i'm here.
this old woman's
gonna run out of air,
and you're gonna have
a tough time convincing people that it wasn't you
who did it to her.
and even if, and even if you do convince them
that you didn't
kill her on purpose,
you're still gonna have
a tough time selling them that you
took care of her
with a fuck!
now, listen to me.
where the fuck is he?
i said where
the fuck is he?
he's on an airplane.
miss antoinette
bought him a ticket
and send him to live
with her family in england.
[whimpers]
all right, it's okay.
that's okay. that's a good girl. suck it up.
there you go. that's it.
take it in. that's a good girl. take it in.
good! good.
good.
that's it. breathe.
maybe you should drop
dead, you selfish cunt.
you ever think
about your kids or your grandkids? huh?
sucking up their inheritance
through that fucked oxygen tube?
and binnie's fucked
intensive care?
you fucks, i hate you.
i hate you both.
i should, i should
fucking both, right now,
i should fucking
kill you fucking both.
you're the fucking reason
this country's going down the drain.
watch out. he's not
in a good mood.
come in.
have a seat.
scotland yard called.
the kid's in england.
make him a material witness.
maybe scotland yard will hold him.
can't do that. he had no
involvement with the crime.
he don't want testify,
we can't compel him.
well, we could still
try flipping one of the three.
you can try
all what you want.
nobody flipping
on godshaw. they're scared to death of him.
as of now, all are
persons of interest.
you gotta let him go.
oh, come on!
five homicides and you're letting him go?
you weren't supposed to let
the kid out of your sight.
be glad he didn't
turn out dead.
this is bullshit.
get the hell outta here.
you're not the one
on the street--
get out of my office.
risking our lives
on the street!
you know what's
involved, right?
maybe if we get a prosecutor
worry about something, we could stand a fucking chance.
what happened when
you went to see the grandmother?
i told you.
she said the woman she takes
care of, bought a plane ticket. he was on his way to england
to stay with
her relatives.
any incidents took
place over there?

waiting for you back at the house.
oh, come on. public
integrity into this?

her son is a united states congressman.
i asked where
daryl was.
his grandmother told me.
you didn't, at any time,
threaten his grandmother?
no, i did not.
you didn't, at
any time, threaten antoinette fahringer?
no, i did not.
you should know a formal
complaint's been filed alleging you cut off
mrs. fahringer's
oxygen supply.
who's saying that?
mrs. fahringer?
is it true?
i think she might
be suffering from a little dementia.
lieutenant, we're
asking if it's true.

and, uh, and
before she died,
she bought me a metal
detector. come on, let me show you something.

i thought that pirates
came up the mississippi
and that they buried
a treasure right there by that tree next to the house.

metal detector my mom gave me
and i went out there
waiting it would start beeping.
it was like beep-beep,
beep, beep, beep.
and i started digging,
and l-l-i dug and i dug and i dug,
and i found a, a
sterling silver spoon, and i was so happy.
i started screaming
and jumping and laughing.
and i went, "hey, man,
this is treasure.
this is pirate treasure."
and i came back in here with it.
and i hid it somewhere,
this sterling silver spoon.
i still can't find it.
it could be anywhere.
i-i know it's here.

third party beneficiary.
your friend here
can fill you in on the details.
i'm working on getting
your money, dave. that's what i'm doing here.
i don't know about you,
but the hardest part of collecting debts
is having to listen
to the stories.
terence owes you
some money?
$50,000. plus my two
young friends here
were supposed to have
a sexual experience of their choosing
with an attractive woman.
nothing. he came across with none of it.
that's wrong. that's wrong
you don't do what you say you're gonna do, terence.
the dope's worth
more than 50,000.
take it.
why don't i take
all the dope?
why are you gonna take
what belongs to me?
well, there was a time
when i wouldn't have.
i would've taken what
was mine and left the rest on the table.
but, you see,
i never got rich enough to retire.
i'm stuck
doing this shit.
and i'm not
young anymore.
so now i don't leave
nothing on the table.
pick it up.
shoot him again.
what for?
his soul's still dancing.
(terence)
shoot him again.
[gunshot]
good night, lieutenant.

doing tonight?
i'm getting outta
here and go to bed.
just for fun, why don't
you stop by the apartment on josephine?
for fun?
you might find something
interesting there.
like what?
these bushwhackers
might've hit a crack pipe while they were there.
you know? the odd chance is
he dropped it under the bed where the kids were.
and we missed it.
the dna'd place
them at the scene.
you had a vision, right?
deoxyribonucleic acid.
(terence)
frankie? frankie.

way to rehab.

bring her her clothes.

our poison.

he scrambles.
hobbs builds his
way to another--

the nature of his injury.
just that he's taken
himself out of the line.
i'll kill him.
renaldo hayes being out,
the freshman johnson has really stepped up
for this football team.
you're in the land of miracles, my boy.
i'm looking right there
at hayes, and i'll tell you what.

like a happy guy. he's on the sideline.
he's obviously suffering
from some sort of injury.

thing between us,
it's gotten way
out of hand. got way outta hand.
