fo shan's citizens were well off and practiced kung fu as a hobby.
martial clubs became popular,
turning fo shan into a province renowned for martial arts.

another competitor
okay, let's start practicing
come on, ready...
one...
two...
one... two...
sir, a master liu is looking for you
may l know who you are?
i'm  the patriarch of the liu fist sect
l just started a martial club in fo shan
congratulations
l hear that master ip is a wing chun expert
l'd love to practice with you today
can we do it some other day?
it's not convenient right now
since i'm  already here,
let's just play around for a bit
it's all private. no one else shall know who wins
it's not a matter of winning. i'm  having dinner
in that case... i'll wait for you
master liu
have you eaten yet?
please join me
you want one?
no, thanks
ls the food all right tonight?
very good indeed
that's good
very quick
leave it, uncle
master liu
please!
please!
are you okay?
i'm  fine...
let's start again!
okay, here l come
touch
touch
all touch
thanks for being lenient, master liu
thanks for teaching me. i've learnt a lot
the pleasure was all mine
regarding this private duel, master lp...
l won't tell anyone. don't worry
thanks so much. i'm  totally grateful
goodbye
farewell
so long
lp pushed master liu's whole body away
isn't "move 1000 catties with 4 taels" tai chi?
l thought master ip practiced
anyway, he pushed him away with one hand
liu refused to admit de
lp kept chasing after him fiercely!
but liu remained indignant after being hit
he jumped at ip like a hungry dog
these tea leaves are pretty good and cheap
thank you
got to go farewell
goodbye goodbye, see you next time
who put these here, uncle ping?
your brother
l thought liu was good but he's so bad at defense
and was beaten up like a pighead
he co-owns his dad's restaurant. he's always idle
ask that kid to serve the customers
good morning
brother lp!
morning, master lp
ls quan here yet?
he's waiting for you upstairs
been here long, quan?
you're always late
i'm  busy
busy with what?
drinking tea, eating, practicing
what else?
this tea smells nice
i'm  talking about you
have you ordered yet?
l got something to discuss with you
let's eat first and then we'll talk
this just came out of the oven! try it...
heard that you had a duel with master liu
and had beaten him quickly. ls that true?
who told you that, lin?
my brother
should've told me earlier. i'm  his disciple now!
but you've been a disciple of every master
was the duel private, brother lp?
we have things to discuss. leave us for now
then l won't disturb your private conversation
good!
morning, master! morning
morning
master
heard that you were beaten by ip man
everyone in fo shan knows about it now
nonsense!
yuan at the restaurant
everything is costly in fo shan these days
so what?
that means the economy is good in fo shan
everybody can afford to spend money
ls that so?
clothing is the most important in our daily lives
there will be lots of demand forfuture clothing
i'll open a cotton mill to provide cotton for them
l want you to be my partner
l don't know anything about business
but l do
i'm  not in need of money
who's yuan? show yourself!
l am
you rascal. you ruined my reputation
l must teach you a lesson!
master...
he's my brother. let's talk
calm down. okay, master?
your brother? he ruined my reputation
he said l was beaten by ip man
what's gonna happen to my martial club?
who will want to be my disciples?
apologize!
l didn't do anything wrong. l told the truth!
you're bullshitting again! you... master...
master ip is upstairs. seek him out if you have guts!
what? go!
take it easy, master...
master...
don't be angry, master
i've been wronged, master lp
master...
please tell everybody
you've defeated master liu in a duel
master lp...
you got to clear my name
you liar, why're you bothering brother lp?
i'm  no liar
l sawthe duel when l was picking up my kite
your kite was cut and fell into brother ip's house
you saw the whole duel between the two masters
lsn't that too much of a coincidence?
that's exactly what happened
even if it's true, you shouldn't have told everyone
you're not supposed to admit to certain things
what's wrong with admitting to the truth?
that might cause embarrassment for others
what embarrassment? i don't know so much
this is embarrassment!
you don't need to do that, lin
why're you laughing? you think i'm invisible?
captain... it's no big deal
what no big deal?
leave! don't you leave!
captain, it's no big deal
l saw everything. i'm  warning you...
i'll nab whoever that causes trouble on my turf
l didn't cause any trouble
someone ruined my name. i'm  here to claim justice
what justice? i am justice
you hooligans are fighting all the time
what age are we in now.
still talking about martial arts?
we're talking about arms and guns!
guns. got it?
you know, captain li...
we martial artists are energetic
sometimes we might be a bit too loud
but that doesn't mean we're not civilized
we're civilized folks. please don't pull the gun
cut me some slack
lin, set a table for captain li. it's on me
yes... captain li, this way please
what you looking at? get lost
don't look don't look... get out of the way
please
master liu
as you please
why so secretive?
i'm  really not good at business
take this to set up the mill.
pay me back if you make a profit
lt'll be a while before l can repay you
take your time
another request: take my son as your disciple
there're so many martial club masters. ask them
none of them is better than you
we're similar
brother lp
lin
brother quan

let's try
dad, did uncle ip agree?
let's go watch over there
you draw very well, zhun
what new moves have you learnt? let's see
brother lp, my master says
this move is offense and defense all in one
attack while defending. defend while attacking
aren't they the same?
go away, ignorant kid
here l come
this move attacks the midrib
stop reciting mantra. hit your target
mom, i'm  done with my drawing
so beautiful. show it to dad
hit to disperse. disperse while hitting
my last move was "disperse while hitting"...
dad, look
wait. i'm not free at the moment
you don't get it? no
come again if you don't get it
try again
dad doesn't want to see it
there you go what?

l couldn't see clearly

that suits you just right
are you afraid of your wife, lp?
no men are afraid of their wives
there're only men who respect their wives
don't worry, mrs lp. l won't beat him to death
if you fear he'll lose, i'll use only one hand
lf that's not enough, l can use no hands at all

on july 7, 1937, the marco polo incident broke out.
japan invaded china
robbing its people of their livelihood and causing
rampant starvation all over the country.
in october, 193
fo shan was occupied by the japanese army
...who destroyed factories, infrastructures and
buildings.
the population of fo shan shrunk
from more than 300,000 to just over 70,000.
only a dozen factories in the whole city
remained in operation still.

all my money is invested in this mill
l can't pay you back for now
don't worry. l almost forgot

you should have ten percent shares
it's really unnecessary

everyone will be lively under your leadership
and l can watch you practice
lp, stay for lunch. it's lunchtime for the workers

dad, why didn't you ask uncle ip to stay?
he doesn't like to owe people favors
dad, you used to practice martial arts, right?
why did you stop?
l get hungry when l exercise
so l need to exercise less, okay?
got it. l won't play outside from now on
you'll only stop playing today. go eat
hurry up and eat
this congee is a bit too thick
but you need to eat some
be careful it's hot

don't worry
i've pawned everything worth pawning
l am strong. l can look for a job
it's not the end of the world

he took the rice even though he's lost
so... l wanted to teach him a lesson
this place is for tournaments only

their deaths got nothing to do with me.
i'm  just an interpreter
l need to scrape a living too!
scrape a living?
you watch your countrymen get beaten to death.
l don't have any
you do. you have lots of it
lf you have the guts, go beat them up!

i'm  back
daddy

have you been good?
yes
good boy
are you tired today?
go wash your face first
you're so good
l realize today i'm  useless
l can't do anything
l practiced marital arts before
but so what?
this world...
is minuscule
i'm  so useless
l don't care what the world is like
l only know i'm  very happy now
as long as you, me, and zhun...
can stay together, everything will be okay
it's essential for a family to stay together

master lp
dad, are you okay?

so thatwe can defend myself
master lp
you're such an expert. please teach us
yes, master lp. please teach us
i'm  a businessman
l know nothing other than running a business
l can't protect them, but you can
in peaceful days, it's okay if you refused to teach
but in bad times now, shouldn't you do something?
teaching martial arts is very costly
are you paying their fees? you owe me again?
uncle lp, i'll be your first disciple
dad, l wanna be taller
taller?
why hasn't ip man come back?
l... l don't know...
find him
l don't know where he is

i'll let you know when the meal is ready
li...
i'm  fine
l really don't know what to say
thank you
it's okay
we better leave fo shan as soon as possible
quan is trying to find a solution for us
where shall we go?
hong kong
in fact, it doesn't matter where
l still have some friends in hong fong
lf something happens to me...
what can happen to you?
nothing will happen to you
they are here again! let's scram!
they are here! they are here!
ls the money ready?
we won't give you money!
what did you say?
i'm  not afraid of you! you can't bully us!
you want me to beat you up?
damn it!
just beat him up!
stop it!
no wonder they dare to resist
they've found a bodyguard
you spurned me for opening a club in fo shan
and today, you wanna mess with me again?
you wanna chase me away?
no one wanna chase you away
lp, have you ever been hungry every day?
everybody is hungry nowadays
the first day l came to fo shan, l told myself...
l would never be hungry again
l will never be hungry again!
feep beating!
beat them!
yuan, why you still idling here? go!
fill them!
fill them!
go
how can we get near him?
let's go!
master, you were so good!
yuan
stop there!
you know what you're doing?
l know. i'm  a robber
you're robbing the chinese
l'd rather be the bully than the bullied
l want everyone to be scared of me!
your brother asked me to give this...
don't talk about him!
you know your brother is dead?
he's beaten to death by the japanese
he looked for you everywhere but couldn't find you
everyone needs to choose his own path
master
that guy told miura you're at the cotton mill
don't go back, ok?
l gotta go. remember, don't go back
scram! hurry up!
don't say a word
you, come here
where's ip man?
tell me!
i'm  asking you!
hang in there. i'll figure out something
speak!
speak! speak up...
i'm  here! i'm  ip man...
i'm  here... li!
wait! wait!
please wait!
li, tell miura the workers are innocent
ask miura to release them
l told you not to come back.
tell him!
shit!
sato!
he dares to hit me... can't we put him to death?
l know what i'm  doing
li yes
since the day you resisted the japanese army
you've already been a dead man
but you're talented, you can be useful to us
so i'll give you one chance to be loyal
to the japanese emperor
teach our army chinese kung fu
that way, we might still spare your life
he wanted you to teach the japanese kung fu
l won't teach the japanese
you wanna see me fight? i'll fight with you
he said he would think about it
he wants to have a duel with general miura
take him away!
take him away!
quan, take my wife and kid away from fo shan
master lp...
general, you really wanna fight with lp?
of course
he's an expert
but he doesn't look like...
he wants to teach the imperial army
he must have other motives trying to fight with you
general, don't fight with him
let me simply shoot him dead
he challenges me to a fight
because he thinks he's better than me
lf l refuse to accept the challenge
but shoot him instead...
isn't that the same as admitting defeat?
fighting with a chinese
is not just a matter of personal honor for you
lt has to do with the national honor of our empire
are you saying l will lose?
l only fear for the worst
l will win for sure
i'll let the whole china know i've won
yes! l understand!
l want you to teach us instead of killing you
because l appreciate your talent
but l don't think chinese kung fu
is better than japanese
we will fight in front of everybody
that's why we need a fair tournament
you invaded our country and killed our people
stop being hypocritical
excuse me
let go of me! let me go back! let go of my mom...
l promised ip nothing would happen to you
it's too dangerous to go back
i heard the japanese are fighting the chinese
who's fighting? lp man
look, the whole place is sealed up now
in the past...
l wished he could be with me every day
so l always complained about his practice
every time he had a duel with someone...
l would throw a tantrum
l never truly supported him
doing what he liked
