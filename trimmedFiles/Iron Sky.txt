one moment we receive conformation
that the ship has landed successfully on the moon
the next, all communication stop

the senators spend
hundred-of-million of campaigns
to get her elected the dog-shit-post
but mr secretary, the expenses
involve this time only makes
sense if it were a military test

the united state has no
military activity on the moon
what about natural resources activity?
we know how the us sometimes
mixes the two up
- is there any chance that you are
looking for helium 3 up there?
helium 3? you just made that up didn't you?
that's so silly
