i think that's mine,
but i didn't order fries.

the barbecued beef.
mine's the chili

aah!
oh, i'm so sorry.
oh, lord.
this isn't real
leather, is it?
this special sucks.
nice going, kid.
ought to
give you the tip.
look at it this way--
in 100 years,
who's going to care?
the 12-gauge
auto-loader.
that's italian.
you can go pump
or auto.
the .45 long slide,
with laser sighting.
these are brand-new.
we just got them in.
that's a good gun.
just touch the trigger,
the beam comes on,
and you put the red dot
where you want
the bullet to go.
you can't miss.
anything else?
a phased plasma rifle
in the 40-watt range.
just what you see, pal.
the uzi 9mm.
you know your weapons,
buddy.
any one of these is
ideal for home defense.
so, uh...
which will it be?
all.
i may close early today.
there's a 15-day wait
on the handguns,
but the rifles
you can take now.
you can't do that.

the name of the victim
in the second of 2
execution-style murders
which took place today.
incredibly, the names
of the 2 victims
are virtually identical.
sarah ann connor
was pronounced dead at the scene
in her santa monica apartment...
can we change this?
sure.
sarah louise connor
was slain...
sarah: don't touch it!
...in her home.
now, police
are refusing to speculate
on the apparent similarity
between these
shooting deaths,

this is 1-l19.
i got a hit-and-run felony.
suspect vehicle--
late model gray ford,
headed westbound on 7th.
he's really moving,
punching lights all the way.
i'm going to need
an ambulance
at 7th and broadway
right now.
hold it!
aah!

for a late-model gray ford,
last seen westbound
on 7th and broadway.
hold on.
are you injured?
are you shot?
no!
do exactly
what i say.
exactly.
don't move
unless i say.
don't make a sound
unless i say.
do you understand?
do you understand?!
yes! yes!
please, don't hurt me.
[honks horn]
i'm here to
help you.
i'm reese,
sergeant techcom,
bn38416,
assigned
to protect you.
you've been targeted
for termination.
police dispatcher:
attempt to intercept, 1-l19.
[imitating policeman]
this is 1-l19.
westbound on olympic
approaching overland.
this is a mistake.
i didn't do anything.
no, but you will.
it's very important
that you live.
this isn't true.
how could that man
just get up after you--
he's not a man.
a machine.
a terminator.
a cyberdine
systems model 101.
a machine?
like a robot?
not a robot. a cyborg.
a cybernetic organism.
no. he was bleeding.
just a second.
get your head down!
all right, listen.
the terminator's
an infiltration unit--
part man, part machine.
underneath,
it's a hyperalloy
combat chassis--
microprocessor
controlled,
fully armored,
very tough.
but outside, it's
living human tissue.
flesh, skin, hair, blood--
grown for the cyborgs.
look, reese, i don't know
what you want from me--
pay attention!
i got to ditch
this car.
the 600 series
had rubber skin.
we spotted them easy.
but these are new.
they look human--
sweat, bad breath,
everything.
very hard to spot.
i had to wait
till he moved on you
before i could zero him.
look...
i am not stupid,
you know.
they cannot make things
like that yet.
not yet.
not for about 40 years.
are you saying
it's from the future?
one possible future.
from your point
of view--
i don't know
tech stuff.
then you're from the future,
too, is that right?
right.
right.
cyborgs don't feel pain.
i do.
don't do that again.
just let me go.
listen!
and understand.
that terminator
is out there.
it can't
be bargained with.
it can't
be reasoned with.
it doesn't feel pity
or remorse
or fear.
and it absolutely
will not stop.
ever!
until you are dead.
can you stop it?
i don't know.
with these weapons,
i don't know.
police radio:
all units. all units.
gray ford suspect
vehicle's been found
in a parking structure
at 4th and beaudry.
reese.
why me?
why does it want me?
there was
a nuclear war...
a few years
from now.
all this...
this whole place.
everything.
it's gone.
just gone.
there
were survivors.
here.
there.
nobody even knew
who started it.
it was
the machines, sarah.
i don't understand.
defense network
computers.
new...
powerful...
hooked
into everything.
trusted
to run it all.
they say
it got smart--
a new order
of intelligence.
<i>then it saw all
people as a threat,</i>
not just the ones
on the other side.
decided our fate
in a microsecond--
extermination.
did you see this war?
[tires screech]
no.
i grew up
after it...
in the ruins.
starving...
hiding from hks.
hks?
hunter-killers.
patrol machines built
in automated factories.
most of us
were rounded up,
put in camps
for orderly disposal.
this was burned in
by laser scanner.
some of us
were kept alive...
to work...
loading bodies.
the disposal units
ran night and day.
we were that close
to going out forever.
there was one man
who taught us to fight,
to storm the wire
of the camps,
to smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk.
he turned it around.
he brought us
back from the brink.
his name is connor.
john connor.
your son, sarah.
your unborn son.
[engine won't turn over]
[engine starts]
[gunshot]
drive!
reese!
reese!
no, reese! no! no!
no! they'll kill you.
policeman:
you in the cadillac!
let me see
your hands now!
get out of the car!
drop to your knees!
out of the car.
drop to the ground.
sarah...
sarah, try to drink
some of this.
are you sure it's them?
maybe i should look
at the bodies.
no. they've
been identified,
and there's
no doubt.
oh, god.
god!
ginger!
sarah.
sarah, this is dr. silberman.
hi, sarah.
i want you to tell him
everything
that reese told you.
do you feel up to that?
yeah. i guess so.
you're a doctor?
criminal
psychologist.
is reese crazy?
well, that's what
we're gonna find out.
[distant siren]
[whirring]
so, you're a soldier,
fighting for whom?
with the 132nd,
under perry.
from 21 to 27.
that's the year 2027?
that's right.
and i was assigned...
this is
fucking great.
...the last 2 years
under john connor.
who was the enemy again?
a computer defense system
built for--
[beep beep beep]
oh, damn. sorry.
built for sac-norad
by cyberdine systems.
i see.
and this, uh, computer
thinks it can win
by killing the mother
of its enemy,
killing him, in effect,
before
he's even conceived,
a sort of
retroactive abortion?
that guy silberman
cracks me up.
last week, he had this guy
in here that burned his afghan.
he screwed it first,
then he set it on fire.
hey, shut up.
why didn't the computer
just kill connor then?
why this elaborate scheme
with the terminator?
it had no choice.
their defense grid
was smashed.
we'd won.
taking out connor then
would make no difference.
skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.
is that when you
captured the lab complex
and found that--
uh, what is it called?
the time displacement
equipment?
that's right. the terminator
had already gone through.
connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.
how are you
supposed get back?
i can't.
nobody goes home.
nobody else comes through.
it's just him...and me.
[cocks rifle]
it's just him...and me.
why didn't you
bring any weapons,
something
more advanced?
don't you have
ray guns?
ray guns.
show me a piece of
future technology.
you go naked.
something about the field
generated by a living organism.
nothing dead will go.
why?
i didn't build
the fucking thing!
ok, ok.
but this...
[sighs] cyborg,
if it's metal--
surrounded
by living tissue!
oh. right,
right--
this is great stuff.
i could make a career
out of this guy.
you see how clever
this part is?
how it doesn't require
a shred of proof?
most paranoid delusions
are intricate,
but this is brilliant.
why were the other
most of the records
were lost in the war.
skynet knew almost nothing
about connor's mother.
her full name, where she lived.
they just knew the city.
the terminator was
just being systematic.
uh-huh. well,
let's go back to--
look, you have heard enough!
i have answered your questions!
now i have to see
sarah connor!
i'm afraid
that's not up to me.
then why am i
talking to you?
because
i can help you.
who is in
authority here? reese--
shut up!
you still don't
get it, do you?
he'll find her.
that's what he does!
that's all he does!
you can't stop him!
he'll wade through you,
reach down her throat,
and pull
her fucking heart out!
doc.
let go of me--
sorry.
so, reese is crazy?
in technical
terminology--
he's a loon.
sarah, this is what
they call body armor.
our tac guys wear these.
it'll stop
a 12-gauge round.
this other individual
must have been wearing one
under his coat.
feel that. go ahead.
what about when he punched
through the windshield?
he was probably
on pcp.
broke every bone
in his hand
and wouldn't feel it
for hours.
there was this guy once--
you see this scar?
here.
thank you.
there's a couch
in this other room.
why don't you stretch out
and try to get some sleep?
it'll be at least an hour
before your mother gets here
from big bear.
i can't sleep.
try.
well,
it may not look it,
but that couch
is very comfortable.
you'll be
perfectly safe.
we got 30 cops
in this building.
thank you.
good night.
good night.

if you want to wait,
there's a bench over there.

what do you mean, forget it?
are you crazy?
take this off.
jesus.
see, it passed
right through the meat.
oh, this is going

would you just
talk about something?
what?
i don't know.
anything. just talk.
tell me about my son.
he's about my height.
aah!
he has your eyes.
what's he like?
you trust him.
he's got a strength.
i'd die for john connor.
well...at least now i know
what to name him.
i don't suppose
you know who the father is,
so i won't tell him
to get lost when i meet him.
john never said
much about him.
i know he dies
before the war--
wait!
i don't want to know.
so, was it john
that sent you here?
i volunteered.
why?
it was a chance
to meet the legend--
sarah connor.
taught her son
to fight, organize,
prepare from
when he was a kid.
when you were in hiding
before the war...
you're talking about things
that i haven't done yet
in the past tense.
it's driving me crazy.
aah!
are you sure
you have the right person?
i'm sure.
come on.
do i look like
the mother of the future?
i mean, am i tough,
organized?
i can't even
balance my checkbook.
look, reese, i didn't
ask for this honor,
and i don't want it!
any of it!
your son gave me a message
to give to you.
made me memorize it.
thank you, sarah,
for your courage
through the dark years.
i can't help you with
what you must soon face
except to say that
the future is not set.
you must be stronger
than you imagine you can be.
you must survive,
or i will never exist.
that's all.
that's a good
field dressing.
you like it?
it's my first.
[car passes]
get some sleep.
it will be light
soon.
ok.
talk to me some more.
about what?
tell me about
where you're from.
all right.
you stay down by day,
but at night
you can move around.
you still
have to be careful
because the hks
use infrared.
but they're
not too bright.
john taught us ways
to dust them.
that's when
the infiltrators
started to appear.
the terminators
were the newest...
the worst.

a little sad.
i used to always wonder
what you were thinking
at that moment.
i memorized every line,
every curve.
i came across time
for you, sarah.
i love you.
i always have.
i shouldn't
have said that.

police radio: 6450
bellingham avenue, super trader.
[radio indistinguishable]
tape 7, november 10.
where was i?
what's most difficult for me
is trying to decide
what to tell you
and what not to.
but i guess
i have a while yet
before you're old enough
to even understand these tapes.
they're more for me
at this point,
just so that
i can get it straight.
<i>gasolina, por favor.</i>
<i>¿cuanto?</i>
<i>llena el tanque.</i>
<i>fill her up, sí.</i>
should i tell you
about your father?
boy, that's a tough one.
will it affect your decision
to send him here,
knowing that he is
your father?
if you don't send kyle,
you can never be.
god, a person
could go crazy
thinking about this.
i suppose
i will tell you.
i owe him that.
maybe it'll help if...
you know that in the few hours
that we had together...
we loved a lifetime's worth.
<i>usted es muy hermosa,
señora,</i>
<i>y tengo que decirle</i>
<i>que necesito
cinco dolares americanos,</i>
<i>pero si no,
mi padre me va a pegar.</i>
what did he just say?
he says you're very
beautiful, señora,
and he's ashamed
to ask you
for 5 american dollars
for his picture,
but if he doesn't,
his father
will beat him.
pretty good hustle, kid.
<i>cuatro.</i>
<i>sí, sí.</i>
<i>gracias.</i>
<i>¡miren, miren!</i>
<i>¡allá!
iviene la tormenta!</i>
what did he just say?
he said there's
a storm coming in.
i know.
