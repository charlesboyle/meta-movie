time...</i>
<i>- rules over us without mercy,
- [man translating
from english to russian]</i>
<i>not caring if we're healthy or ill,
hungry or drunk,</i>
<i>russian, american,
beings from mars.</i>
it's like a fire. it could either
destroy us or keep us warm.
that's why every fedex office
has a clock.
because we live or we die
by the clock.
we never turn our back
on it.
and we never, ever
allow ourselves...
the sin of losing track
of time!
locally, it's 1:56.
that means we've got
three hours and four minutes...
before the end-of-the-day's
package sort.
<i>- that's how long we have.
that's how much time we have...
- [translating]</i>
before this pulsating, accursed,
relentless taskmaster...
tries to put us
out of business.
hey, nicolai. hey.
nicolai, good to see you.
how are you, kid?
look what you did.
you just delivered
your very first fedex package.
that deserves something special,
like a snickers bar...
and a c.d. player.
and something to listen to...
a c.d. there.
elvis presley.
fifty million fans can't be wrong.
you all recognize this,
don't you?
i took the liberty
of sending this to myself.
i fedex'd it
before i left memphis.
you're probably wondering
what could be in here.
what could it possibly be?
is it architectural plans?
maybe technical drawings?
is this the new wallpaper
for the... for the bathroom?
<i>[translator continues]</i>
it is... a clock,
which i started
at absolute zero...
and is now at 87 hours,
from memphis, america
to nicolai in russia, 87 hours.
eighty-seven hours
is a shameful outrage.
this is just an egg timer!
what if it had been something else?
like your paycheck?
<i>- or fresh boysenberries?
or adoption papers?
- [translating]</i>
eighty-seven hours
is an eternity.
the cosmos was created
in less time!
wars have been fought and
nations toppled in 87 hours!
fortunes made and squandered.
[translating]
<i>what?</i>
what are you saying
about me?
i tell them,
what do they expect?
this man, when his truck broke down,
he stole a boy's bicycle
to do his delivery.
i borrowed it!
i borrowed a kid's bike.
and i got my packages delivered,
and that is what you people
are gonna have to start doing.
you have to start doing
whatever it takes, because
in three hours and two minutes...
every one of these packages
has to be on the big truck...
and on its way
to the airport.
<i>- [bell rings]
- fifteen minutes!</i>
- crunch time! crunch time!
- crunch time!
let's go! every package
on the airport truck.
go!
crunch, crunch, crunch!
- we have a big problem.
- what?
- the truck in red square is stuck.
- what do you mean?
- it's stuck.
- stuck how? in snow? in ice?
it's stuck! the most important truck...
the kremlin truck! many packages.
all right, all right, all right.
let's put the table right here.
we'll just do the sort.
ah, yeah, a clamp.
that would make us stuck.
let's go. unload...
get him out of there.
right here.
two lines, two lines.
one to the airport truck,
one to the moscow truck.
got it?
c.d.g., f.e., m. e,
memphis on the airport truck.
everything else right there.
nicolai! tick-tock, tick-tock.
four minutes.
[ringing]
[answering machine] hi, this is kelly.
if you're calling for chuck, press one.
otherwise leave a message
after the tone. thanks.
- [beeps]
- [chuck]
hello, kelly. are you there?
pick up, pick up, pick up,
pick up. you're not there.
<i>you're not gonna believe this. i'm doin'
the sorts in the middle of red square...</i>

<i> i miss you  </i>
i miss you
i really wanna kiss you
i'm outta here in two minutes and
i'm pickin' up the sweep through paris,
so i should be back in memphis
about 18 hours or so.
that's the good news.
the bad news is...
i gotta go to
the dentist this week.
i got something in there
that's hurtin'.
i love you and i'm gonna see you soon,
and you know what that means.
bye-bye. nicolai! tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock!
[speaking french]
- [knocking]
- i absolutely, positively
have to get to memphis tonight.
can't help you.
try u.p.s.
with this extra head wind, are we gonna
be able to push it and make the sort?
- we'll do our best.
- "our best," huh?
gwen, is there something wrong
with our doctors thatjack
keeps getting certified to fly?
- aren't you concerned?
- i'm terrified.
but a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.
that's the spirit.
relentless is our goal. relentless!
what do you expect from the guy
who stole a crippled kid's bicycle...
- when his truck broke down?
- i borrowed it.
but i love that
the kid's now crippled.
so you missed the last truck
by two minutes?
two minutes.
actually, it was less than that.
the plane wasn't that heavy.
you could've added some fuel,
picked up the speed
and made up the time.
it's about the trucks.
today's truck was two minutes late.
tomorrow's will be four minutes late,
and then six minutes
and eight minutes late.
- next thing you know,
we're the u.s. mail.
- yeah, well...
all i'm sayin' is, if you'd
gotten all those trucks on the plane,
those russkies would be
walking on water right now.
hey, don't...
don't gimme that look.
- it's just grape juice. right, chuck?
- yeah.
it's like a 1992
full-bodied grape juice.
i see no evil, hear no evil,
speak no evil.
we'd offer you some but, you know,
somebody's got to fly the plane.
yeah, well,
i "just say no," right?
listen, stan,
i've been meaning to ask you.
how's mary?
oh. uh, well,
- we really don't know anything yet.
- mm-hmm.
uh, she went to
the doctor yesterday, and, uh,
it hasn't meta...
metastasized...
as far as they
can tell right now.
it's just kind of
wait and see.
i'm so sorry.
tell her i'm gonna come by
and see her on my next layover.
i want you to know, stan,
we are all thinking about her and you.
<i>- and just blessings.
- thank you, gwen.</i>
<i>[answering machine] hi, this is kelly.
if you're calling for chuck, press one.</i>
otherwise, leave a message
after the tone. thanks.
stan.
listen.
uh, i heard about this...
i heard about this doctor
down in emory, in atlanta.
uh, he's supposed to be
the absolute best.
he worked on
frank toretta's wife.
frank toretta is
a systems analyst.
he played center field for us.
you know him.
in the softball tournament
last labor day.
anyway, beside the point.
uh, what i was thinking is,
is that i could get his number...
the doctor...
and, uh,
you know,
put you all together and...
you know, you could
get this thing fixed.
you could beat it.
thanks, chuck.
[sighs]
so, i'll get his number.
<i>[elevator bell dings]</i>

- [all] no.
- the turkey is perfect.
[indistinct chattering]
- how many did you do last night?
- last night? 2.9 million.
now you've got to be in the market
for more of these candied yams.
here you go.
the record.
look at those marshmallows.
when i was there,
we did two million.
- we thought that was a big deal.
- the glory days.
- what'd they do the first night?
- the very first night?
<i>- [man #1] twelve.
- [man #2] twelve thousand?</i>
<i>- hell, no. twelve.
- [chuck] that's right.</i>
and they did the sort
right there on a card table.
and fred smith had
that card table bronzed.
i've been hearing that
for five years.
<i>- it's in his office today.
- they go from that to
the new hub up in anchorage.</i>
it's state of the art...
a perfect marriage...
between technology
and systems management.
speaking of marriage, chuck,
when are you gonna make
an honest woman out of kelly?
<i>[excited chattering]</i>
- how long?
- fourteen minutes into the meal.
- you won. i owe you $5.
- so i win.
- way before the pie.
- i told him on the way up.
right about the time
the pie came out, the marriage...
kelly is still recovering from her
failed relationship with that parolee.
he was a lawyer.
i knew it had something to do
with raising your right hand...
and swearing
to tell the truth.
<i>remember when he fell on the sidewalk
and broke his shoulder
at the wedding reception?</i>
he tripped on a curb
holding a door open for me.
<i>- aunt kelly was married before?
- [kelly]
it's not even worth remembering.</i>
so since her failed marriage
to the parolee...
- oh, my god.
- kelly can't see being with a man
who wears a pager to bed.
what're you gonna
attach it to, hoss?
<i>when you wear it to bed, i hope
you got one of those things...</i>
that go vibratin'.
watch it.
i'm not touching that.
<i>oh, did you
hit an olive pit?</i>
<i>- i thought i took all of them out.
- no, no, it's not that.</i>
<i>[guests chattering]</i>
- okay, i'll cancel saturday.
- no, don't.
if i'm not here, i'm not.
but if i am, well,
- then i am.
- it's cancelled.
but you gotta be here
new year's eve.
malaysia can't be that bad.
i'll be here new year's eve.
when are you defending
your dissertation?
january 12.
[sighs] i'm gonna have to
switch over the south america thing.
if i do that
on the third or fourth,
i'm gonna have to head
back out on the 13th.
so long as you're here
new year's eve.
i will be here new year's eve.
i promise.

i got a gift for you.
we have to do it

hmm.
you haven't said anything about
your presents. is there a problem?
i'm sorry, no!
i love 'em.
look at my journal.
ah!
- what about the pager?
- real leather.
the pages have gold on 'em.
<i>- did you like the pager or not?
- yes.</i>
i love it. look at him in
his little blue russian house.
<i>- it's from russia.
- my god.</i>
<i>- it's not one of those loud ones?
- no. you can program it
so it vibrates...</i>
and lights up
and see it in the dark.
it seems like
a real nice pager.
<i>- sorry about the hand towels.
you're hard to shop for.
- no, no. i love 'em.</i>
<i>- every time i wash my hands,
i will think of you.
- all right, i gotta go.</i>

- i love you too.
<i>chuck! keys!</i>
- thank you.
- that reminds me. i almost forgot.
i have one more present
for you.
only this isn't an "open in the car"
kind of present...
like, say, hand towels.
which were a joke,
by the way.
i'm terrified.
just take it and hold onto it,

pretty well-made fire,
huh, wilson?
<i>[thunderclap]</i>
so... wilson.
we were en route...

for 11 and a half hours.
about 475 miles an hour.
so they think that
we are right here.
but...
we went out
of radio contact...
and flew around that storm
for about an hour.
so that's a distance
of what, 400 miles?
four hundred miles squared.
that's 160,000...
times pi... 3.14.
[mumbling]
five hundred and two thousand,
four...
that's a search area

that's twice the size

<i>this tooth is just killing me.</i>

not much to eat around here,</i>
<i>because i don't think
i could chew it.</i>
<i>just keep sucking on all

<i>and just think,</i>
<i>i used to avoid

this could work.

this could work.
twenty-two...
forty-four lashings.
forty-four lashings.
so...
we have to make rope again.
wilson, we're gonna have to make
a hell of a lot of rope.
eight lashings
of these structurals.
that's 24 apiece.
that'll be 100... 160.
<i>here we are today.</i>
that gives us another month and a half
until we're into march and april,
which is our best chances for
the high tides and the offshore breezes.
we need...
we need 424 feet...
of good rope, plus another 50 feet,
say, for miscellaneous.
round that off to
now, if we average
plus, we have to build it,
we have to stock it,
we have to launch it.
that's gonna be tight.
that is not much time.
but we...
we live and we die by time,
don't we?
now, let's not commit the sin
of turning our back on time.
[laughs]
i know.
i know.
this is it.
that's all that's left.
i checked over the whole island,
and that is all that's left.
so we're gonna be short.
short.
we'll just have to make some more
out of the videotape.
yes.
no, we have time.
we do. we have time.
look!
the wind's still blowing in
from the west.
i know!
yeah, i know... i know where
there's 30 feet of extra rope!
but... but i'm not
going back up there.
there, there.
there, you see? huh?
there.
are you happy?
do you have to keep bringing that up?
can't you just forget it?
huh? you were right.
you were right.
it was a good thing that we did a test,
'cause it wasn't gonna be
just a quick little snap.
i would have landed
on the rocks.
broken my leg or my back or my neck.
bled to death.
but it was the only option i had
at the time though, okay?
it was what, a year ago?
so let's just forget it.
and what is your point?
well...
we might just make it.
did that thought
ever cross your brain?
well, regardless, i would rather take
my chance out there on the ocean...
than to stay here and die
on this shithole island,
spending the rest of my life
talking to a goddamn volleyball!

stan, i'm so sorry
i wasn't around when mary died.
i should've been there for you,
and i wasn't.
i'm so sorry.
four years ago,
the fedex family lost
five of our sons.
that was a terrible
and tragic day.
but today,
one of those sons,
chuck noland,
has been returned to us.
chuck, welcome home.
[applause]
<i>[male newscaster]
just moments ago, fred smith
welcomed home chuck noland.</i>
<i>- how about it, michelle?
- it's such an incredible
and amazing story...</i>
<i>- to come back from the dead.
- well, it's so amazing that
smith himself welcomed him back.</i>
<i>and fred acknowledged that,
"while time waits for no man,</i>
<i>we take time to pause
to honor one of our own. "</i>
<i>now, that's an expensive pause.</i>
<i>[tvcontinues]</i>
i'm-i'm sorry.
i must be in the wrong place.
no, you're in
the right place.
you probably don't remember me.
i actually did root canal on you
about five years ago.
jim spaulding referred you.
oh, yeah, yeah.
i'm kelly's husband.
<i>jerry lovett.</i>
<i>kelly wanted...</i>
<i>kelly wanted to be here...</i>
<i>look, this is very hard
for everyone.</i>
<i>i can't even imagine
how hard it is for you.</i>
kelly, uh...
she's had it rough.
first when she thought
she lost you,
and now dealing
with all of this.
it's-it's confusing.
it's very emotional for her.
<i>she's...</i>
<i>she's... sort of lost.</i>
maybe you could just
give her a little more time.
anyway, uh,
i'm sorry that...
[inaudible]
okay, people, let's go.
party's over. let's go home.
let's go home.
<i>[maynard] you're definitely
gonna have to go down to the dmv.</i>
okay, maynard, let's go.
chuck's had a big day.
- i have to brief this man
on his meetings tomorrow...
- i know.
with the accountants
and the attorneys, all right?
i will see you
bright and early in the morning.
- hey, chuck, welcome home. we love you.
- becca, i need to speak to you.
you know, chuck, we gotta catch up
on some of that fishin', now.
take care.
- good night.
- good night.
you got everything
you need? okay.
well, if you need anything,
just sign for it,
and i'll see you
in the morning.
get some sleep, okay?
we got another big day tomorrow.
it takes a lot of paperwork
to bring back a man.
<i>- bring you back to life, man.
- [becca] bye, chuck.</i>
- take care, now.
- tomorrow.
tomorrow we're gonna
bring you back to life.
how long are you
gonna be, man?
well...
- how long will that buy me?
- about ten minutes.
i'm awake.
i saw your taxi drive up.
get in here
out of the rain.
i saw you
down at the hub today,
so i know you were down there.
let me get you a towel.
they're sleeping.
if you come in,
i'll make you some coffee.
it's a nice house.
yeah, we got
a nice mortgage too.
what's your daughter's name?
<i>katie.</i>
katie.
<i>- she's a beautiful little girl.
- she's a handful.</i>
just let me get
one thing straight here.
we have a pro football team now,
but they're in nashville?
[sighs, chuckles]
um, yeah. oh, my god. okay.
they used to be in houston.
<i>first they were the oilers,
and now they're the titans.</i>
the houston oilers
are the tennessee titans?
yeah.
but that's not all.
they went to the super bowl
last year.
<i>- and i missed that.
- you would've died. it was so exciting.</i>
they almost won by one yard.
one lousy yard right at the end.
i got whole milk,
<i>i don't have any half-and-half,
and that's what you like.</i>
that'll do fine.
what happened to you
becoming a professor?
you're not
dr. kelly frears-lovett?
when you, um...
when your plane went down,
everything just sort of
got put on hold.
i think about
taking it up again, though.
i came out here
to give you this.
oh, my god.
i'm sorry it doesn't work.
and i, uh,
i kept the picture.
it was all faded anyway.
i want you to have it.
i gave it to you.
that's a family heirloom,
and it should stay in your family.
<i>that's everything i have
from when you went down to now.</i>
they said they never figured out
what caused the crash.
probably some mislabeled
hazardous material caught fire.
so here's where
that ship found you.
you drifted about 500 miles.
this is where
your island was,
about 600 miles
south of the cook islands.
and these are
the search grids.
ships went back and forth
for weeks looking for you.
i never should've
gotten on that plane.
i never should've
gotten out of the car.
i wanna show you something.
come here.
this is...
this is our car.
you kept our car.
all right, now,
this is weird.
it's a good car.
had a lot of memories
in this car.
two very nice memories.
oh, that trip
down to the gulf, yeah.
so, can i drive it?
it's your car.
that's good, 'cause my...
my taxi's gone.
um...
let me get some stuff
out of the back.
you think you're gonna
have more kids?
i don't know.
it's kind of confusing
right now.
well, you should.
i mean, really,
you should.
i would.
so, what now?
i don't know.
i really don't know.
[starts engine]
you said
you'd be right back.
i'm so sorry.
me too.
chuck!
chuck!
chuck!
i always knew you were alive.
i knew it.
but everybody said
i had to stop saying that...
that i had to let you go.
i love you.
you're the love of my life.
i love you too, kelly.
more than you'll ever know.
chuck?
you have to go home.
we both had done
the math, and...
kelly added it all up.
she knew she had
to let me go.
i added it up,
knew that i'd...
i'd lost her.
'cause i was never gonna
get off that island.
i was gonna die there,
totally alone.
i mean, i was gonna get sick or
i was gonna get injured or something.
the only choice i had,
the only thing
i could control...
was when and how...
and where
that was gonna happen.
so... i made a rope.
and i went up to the summit
to hang myself.
but i had to test it,
you know?
of course.
you know me.
and the weight of the log...
snapped the limb
of the tree.
so l-l...
i couldn't even kill myself
the way i wanted to.
i had power over nothing.
and that's when this feeling
came over me like a warm blanket.
i knew...
somehow...
that i had to stay alive.
somehow.
i had to keep breathing,
even though there was
no reason to hope.
and all my logic said that
i would never see this place again.
so that's what i did.
i stayed alive.
i kept breathing.
and then one day
that logic was proven all wrong,
because the tide...
came in,
gave me a sail.
and now, here i am.
i'm back...
in memphis, talking to you.
i have ice in my glass.
and i've lost her
all over again.
i'm so sad that
i don't have kelly.
but i'm so grateful that
she was with me on that island.
and i know
what i have to do now.
i gotta keep breathing.
because tomorrow,
the sun will rise.
who knows what the tide
could bring?
<i>[elvis presley]

hello!

[whistles]
fedex!
[door alarm beeping]
- you look lost.
- i do?
where are you headed?
well, i was just about
to figure that out.
well, that's 83 south.
<i>and this road here will
hook you up with l-40 east.</i>
if you turn right,
that'll take you to
amarillo, flagstaff,
california.
and if you head back
that direction,
<i>you'll find a whole lotta nothin'
all the way to canada.</i>
i got it.
all right, then.
good luck, cowboy.
<i>- [starts engine]
- thank you.</i>
