or obsolete future
my paws love to maul an mc
'cause he's faker than a psychic
with caller id

and she can just dream
and not have to be
in a stinky trailer with me
so when i feel blue

(imitates roaring)
good night, baby. go to sleep.
if you're going to live here,
you have to get along with greg.
he started it.

where's your car?
i left it for janeane.
you're going to let me borrow your car?

i know.
but you're still my little rabbit, right?
i need to get to sleep.
bunny! what up, doe?

i'm living back here, man.
wink: what happened last night?
i heard you got caught out.

there's nobody there but clowns
who ain't got deals and never will.
you need to stay at home.
you know wink's got you.
- whatever, man.

look, i was just on the horn
with my man roy darucher.
- the promo guy?
- yeah.
roy's all hooked up at 98.
so what's he need you for?
what's he need me for? talent, dawg.
you know that's my specialty.
i'm the one that tipped him on big o,
and got that fat man out of
flipping burgers at mickey d's.
roy liked what he heard,
paid for the nigga's demo,
and boom, just like that,
big o got a deal, all because of me.
- roy paid for big o's demo?
- every penny.
if they thought big o was hot,
wait till they hear b-rabbit.
i'm building an empire
and i'm taking you with me.
you're next.

but i need some extra shifts.

manny: you just started working here.
hey, dutton.

living with my fucking mom.

(singing) well, jimmy moved in
with his mother
'cause he ain't got no place to go
(singing) now i'm right back in the gutter
with a garbage bag
that's full of clothes

'cause i'm back in the 810 now
(singing) 'cause i live at home in a trailer

with you and me as the anchors.
did you hear that wink
has been talking to that promo guy?
yeah, i heard that bullshit.
wink is scandalous, dawg.
could be a shot.
you know i'm trying to get straight
with the lord,
so i don't like bringing too much
negative into my positive world,
but wink is just talking shit.
there'll be no action, just talk.
(singing) sweet home alabama

sol: you were scared!
dj iz: you were scared!
future: no, you were scared, motherfucker!
do you know how many abandoned
buildings we have in detroit?
how can you have pride
in your neighborhood
with shit like that next door?
does the city tear them down?
they're too busy building casinos
and taking money from people.
shut your preaching ass up.
nobody care about that shit.
did you care
when the crackhead raped that girl?
you think it would've happened
without an abandoned house?
- they caught him, didn't they?
- future: yeah.
dumb motherfucker went back to the house.
how stupid could a nigga be.
- what's happening under that hood?
- it's a just a short. chill out.
i ain't getting back in that piece of shit.

(dj iz beat-boxing)
(rapping) you forced to listen to
the individual, the metaphysical
the mac mitten rhyme ritual
heterosexual
syllables sound complex to you
lines perplexing you
with words that put a hex on you

leadaz of tha free world.
hip-hop shop, wednesday night.
come on down.
sol: lt'll be your only opportunity
to blow both of us.
after we go platinum,
you won't be able to get to me and future.
why do they call you future?
i had a lot of names,
the most conceited kind.
i was maximum, brimstone,
godfather d, devastatin' d.
big d, that has a double meaning.
but none of them worked,
till i started hosting the battles
at the shelter.
one day somebody said, "you know what?
you are the future of hip-hop in detroit."
so you see, baby,
sometimes you got to find your name
and other times,
your name finds you.
want to smoke some ganja?
that's our problem.
if we don't respect our sisters, who will?
we're doing it to ourselves.
he's my brother. he don't like pussy.
rabbit, teach me to write rhymes.
that's how to get the ladies, right?
let me out.
hold on. yo, i'm sorry, dawg.
i didn't know papa and lc were
on their bullshit until tonight.
i wouldn't be with them,
except i'm promoting a show
with them at hip-hop shop.
those free world bitches?
see what i'm talking about?
look, they're just one of the acts.
if you want, i'll step out.
you're my friend. i don't want you mad.
man, do what you want to do.
yeah, do what you want to do.
respect yourself, sister.
god damn. don't you ever shut up?
why you got to push me?
damn, future.
what the hell is his problem?
- future?
- wink: yeah.
he thinks sometimes you talk shit.
who's he to say what's real?
'cause he hosts the battles?
ain't that janeane?
cheddar: i thought she was pregnant.
sol: pregnant?
i'm out. i'll be outside.
by myself.
(romantic hip-hop music playing)
here's your chance, girl. go ahead.
you're jimmy smith, jr.
my name's alex.

- at the plant.
that was my brother. i was borrowing a car.
i hear you're a real dope rapper.
- a "dope" rapper?
- yeah.
who told you that?
you know, it's around.
if you're so dope,
why are you at dead end stamping?
- your brother works there.
- my brother's a loser.
and you?
i work at intermezzo,
saving enough to get out of here.
bussin' dishes is much better
than pressing bumpers.
i won't be there long.
- where are you going?
- new york.
i won a modeling contest.
a judge said he'd help me out.
i just have to get a book together.
what if he ain't for real?
all i'm looking for is a ticket.
rabbit! you and your friend want
to bounce to an after-hours spot?
"rabbit."
let me ask my friends.
where are we going?
my house.
- what about your mom?
- working nights.
that's the after-hours spot?
heck, yeah.
can some of us ride with you?
(sexy hip-hop song playing)
- why do they call you rabbit?
- he's fast and likes to fuck a lot.
get your hand off my balls!
why are you being so ignorant?
wink: jimmy!
- what's wrong with you?
- my bad, you guys.

not yet, but i'm working on
something for him.
he'll record a demo at mca.

future: you can't catch me

jimmy: out of my way, freaky girl!
wink: wipe your feet. hey, wipe your feet!
(hip-hop music playing)
future: you like?
she's getting out of the d, though.
negro, please. that's what they all say.

hey.
i saw you talking to papa doc
in the chin tiki.
- how do you know him?
- you mean clarence?
he went to cranbrook
with christine's brother.
cheddar: you want to dance?
kyla: not right now.
fucking wink. trying to keep us in division
with that fake-ass big willie wannabe talk.
- nothing wrong with a free demo.
- free comes with a dick up your ass.
three one third is real.
what wink is talking about is wack.
dj iz: another example of people's needs
being denied by the city.
the media should be all over this.
it'll happen again. the city don't give a fuck.
both: what is he talking about?
the abandoned house
where the girl got raped.
dj iz: it's called an "attractive nuisance."
it wouldn't still be standing if
it were on the other side of 8 mile.
it could have been lily.
future: burn this shit down to the ground.
that's what i mean.
jimmy: fuck, yeah, man!
burn this fucking thing down!
dj iz: this is the definition
of an attractive nuisance.
cheddar: come on, let's burn this bitch.
rocky: right behind you.
dj iz: that's what i mean.
future: i thought i had matches.
sol: you got my lighter?
- i gave it back to you.
- cheddar: i got one.
future: wait, what are you doing?
all: no!
jimmy: what the fuck, you guys!
sol: i'm gonna fuck you up, cheddar!
(laughing)
burn!
hey! i burned the house down!

the roof is on fire
we don't need no water

burn, motherfucker, burn!
it's almost beautiful.
when i was little,
i wanted to live in a house like this.
you know, how it used to be.
you live with your family?
i got out of there as quick as i could.
i left home when i was 17.
what about you?
(sirens wail)
sort of the same.
when you record your demo,
i'd really love to be there.
wink: hey, girl! is it hot enough for you?
you're going to be great.
i got a feeling about you.
kyla: let's go, alex.
i'll see you.

future: cheddar, bring your ass on!

lyrical motherfucker out there!

like the time you said
your cousin worked for dr. dre?
or the time you were real tight
with the intern in russell simmons' office?
- or how about...
- shut the fuck up!
why are you always giving me shit?
is it because i'm making moves?
or because your ass is stuck
hosting battles for two years.
you're a fucking loser.
future: who are you calling...
jimmy: yo, chill!
what the fuck?
how can you fight about this shit now?
i know what you're trying to do

(rapping) i'm getting so sick and tired
of fucking with this steel
they only give us 30 minutes
to eat lunch and chill
my body aching
just to get a buck
i'm sick of eating shit
off this fucking lunch truck
nasty-ass food
i'm in a nasty-ass mood
should have called in sick
shit, i had somethin' to do!
(rapping) i can't believe i'm hearin'
all this ravin' and rantin'
from vanessa up here
at new detroit stampin'
need to get your food
and take your ass back to work
you're dreamin' if you think
them corny-ass raps'll work
look at y'all standin' here
freezing like dumb-fucks
rappin' and waitin' for food
off this raggedy lunch truck
who want what?
who pumped up to get rolled up?
i spit venom in every direction
soak some up
look at this fat-ass nigga
sloppy sucka
you a ugly motherfucker
your pops should've wore a rubber
stop rhyming
keep your day job, vanessa
next time leave that bullshit
home on the dresser
speakin' of dresses
take a look at paul the fruitcake
when you travel
you pack panties in your suitcase
made out of lace
from victoria's secret
if 10 men came in a cup,
you'd probably drink it
(rapping) okay, folks
enough with the gay jokes
especially from a gay,
broke bitch yourself
eh, loc?
his style's doo-doo
you've worked here longer than me
and i get paid more than you do
dawg, take a seat
why's this guy standing in line?
he ain't got money to eat
check this out
yo, yo
he cashed his whole check
and bought one ho ho
fucking homo, little maggot
you can't hack it
paul's gay
you're a faggot
least he admits it,
don't even risk it
this guy's starving to death
someone get him a biscuit
i don't know
what they told you, mike
you musta had them cornrows
rolled too tight
this job
you want to quit, but you can't
you've worked at this plant so long
you're a plant!
look at your god damn boots
for christ sakes
they're starting to grow roots!
on this mic, you get faded
you look like a pissed-off rapper
who never made it
hey, why you fuckin'
with the gay guy, g?
when really you're the one
who's got the hiv
man, i'm done with this clown
he's soft

the medical establishment will fuck you.
jimmy: where else would he be?
just thank god he's alive.

that's why brothers need to get a deal.
record labels supply niggas with benefits.

not blue cross.
i don't give a fuck about that.
i just want to hear three one third

future: one of them songs on jlb.
we need to save, put it into savings bonds,
and build our own studio.
- savings bonds?
- sol: let me ask you something.
how are we brothers?
we need fine bitches and phat rides,
not savings bonds.
all we ever do is talk shit!
"we need fine bitches and phat rides."
"we need to invest in savings bonds."
"we need to get our songs on jlb."
shut the fuck up! and we never do shit.
we're still broke
and live at home with our moms.
