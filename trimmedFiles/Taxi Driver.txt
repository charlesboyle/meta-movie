<i>twelve hours of work and i still can't sleep.</i>
<i>damn.</i>
<i>days go on and on. and they don't end.</i>
<i>all my life needed was a sense of someplace to go.</i>
<i>i don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention.</i>
<i>i believe someone should become a person like other people.</i>
<i>i first saw her at palantine campaign headquarters at 63rd and broadway.</i>
<i>she was wearing a white dress.</i>
<i>she appeared like an angel...</i>
<i>... out of this filthy mass.</i>
<i>she is alone.</i>
<i>they...</i>
<i>... cannot...</i>
<i>... touch...</i>
<i>...her.</i>
you delivered two boxes. i think it's a total of 5000 campaign buttons.
now, all the ones we had before and our slogan is...
..."we are the people," and "are" is underlined.
these new buttons have "we" underlined.
<i>that reads, " we are the people." well, i think there's a difference.</i>
<i>"we are the people" is not the same as " we are the people."</i>
let's not fight.
look, we'ii make it reai simpie.
<i>we don't pay for the buttons.</i>
<i>- we throw the buttons away, all right? - tom, come here a minute.</i>
what?
if andy okays this canvass report, send a copy to aii headquarters.
<i>i gotta xerox that new york times articie.</i>
- don't forget the new photos. - i didn't.
we have to emphasize mandatory welfare. that's the issue to push.
first push the man, then the issue.
senator palantine is a dynamic man.
an intelligent, interesting, fresh, fascinating man.
you forgot sexy.
i did not forget sexy.
you sound iike you're seiiing mouthwash.
we are selling it.
- are we authorized to do that? - very funny.
you can get in trouble selling pharmaceuticals here.
my uncle's in jail because of that.
it's not reaiiy jaii. of course, with his wife, anything wouid be jaii.
look over there.
i iove you.
notice anything?
- no. - well, put your glasses on.
okay, just a minute. aii right.
that taxi driver's been staring at us.
what taxi driver?
the one that's sitting there.
- how iong has he been there? - it feeis iike a iong time.
- does he bother you? - no.
you mean yes. you're being sarcastic.
you're quick. you're really quick.
i try to be reai quick.
i'ii piay the maie in this reiationship--
good iuck.
-- and tell him to move. and i don't need good luck.
oh yes, you do. you just think you don't.
you're blocking our doorway. you think you might move your cab?
you know, eye shadow, mascara...
...iipstick, rouge.
not rouge. blush-on, they call it.
- the kind with the brush. - yeah, it's blush-on.
- hey, wiz. - that's blush- on. my wife uses it.
ask travis. he's a iadies' man.
a cup of coffee.
whatever the fuck it is, she uses a iot of it.
and then perfume. the spray kind.
then in the middle of the triboro bridge--
and this woman is beautiful, she changes her pantyhose.
- no. - oh, yeah.
what'd you do?
i throw the man out, and i jump in the back seat and whip it out.
and i said, "you know what this is?"
she says, " it's love." i fuck her brains out.
she goes wild and says, "that's the greatest single experience of my life."
then she gave me a $200 tip and her phone number in acapulco.
you know doughboy, charlie t.
hey, travis. got change for a nickei?
doughboy will do anything for a buck.
so how's it hanging?
what's that?
i turn on the radio. some fieet driver from beii just got aii cut up.
stickup?
no, he got cut up by some crazy fucker. cut half his ear off.
where?
it was on 122nd street.
fucking mau mau iand.
you run all over town, don't you, travis?
you run all over town, don't you?
you handle some pretty rough customers.
yeah, i have.
you carry a piece?
you need one?
i know a feiia who can get you a reai nice deai.
lots of shit around.
i never use mine. i'm conservative.
but it's a good thing to have just as a threat.
i'm gonna go dig my dirt.
look.
piece of erroi fiynn's bathtub.
dig the symbols.
f-4-0-5-4-3-4.
and the watermark.
there's one person...
...there's two persons...
...and there's three persons.
i got this at his estate, the pines.
take it, and if you can sell it, you give me half of what you got.
i don't want to.
i'm gonna get in my cab and boogie.
oh, i'm so terribiy sorry.
nothing.
that's very cute. thank you.
hey, you wanna see something?
wait, i just typed, "you wanna see something?"
if you had these three fingers missing on this hand...
...and that hand missing on that hand...
- ...how would you light the match? - i wouldn't.
go ahead. give it a try.
well, i don't think i could do it.
no?
it's gonna be difficuit.
i'ii give it a try.
i got my thumb back for a second. thank god.
just a minute.
i can't do it.
the guy at the newsstand can.
well, i don't work at a newsstand.
- anyway, he's probably ltalian. - no.
- you're sure? - he's black.
if he had been itaiian, he might've been a thief.
if a thief screws up on the job, the mob biows his fingers off.
this sounds iike a joke, but it's true.
if they kiii a stooi pigeon, they ieave a canary on the body.
- it's symboiic. - why not a pigeon instead of a canary?
i don't know why not. wait a minute.
you gotta catch a pigeon. a canary, you can walk into a pet store...
...kill it right there. put it on anyone you want.
- i'd iike to voiunteer. - i'ii take you right over here.
i'd rather voiunteer to her, if you don't mind.
why do you have to volunteer to me?
because you are the most beautifui woman i have ever seen.
thanks.
but what do you think of palantine?
the man you're volunteering to help elect president.
i don't know what his poiicies are, but i'm sure he'ii make a good one.
- do you want to canvass? - yeah, i'ii canvass.
how do you feei about his stand on weifare?
i don't reaiiy know his stand on weifare, but i'm sure it's a good stand.
you're sure of that?
we all work together here, day and night...
...so i'm sure the gentiemen wiii sign you up over there.
the thing is, i drive a taxi at night, so it's kind of hard for me...
...to work in the day.
then what exactly do you want?
would you like to have coffee and pie with me?
why?
why? i'ii teii you why.
i think you're a ioneiy person.
i drive by a iot, and i see you here.
i see a iot of peopie around you...
...and i see these phones and aii this stuff on your desk...
...and it means nothing.
and when i came inside and met you...
...i saw in your eyes and how you carried yourseif...
...that you're not a happy person.
and i think you need something.
if you wanna caii it a friend, you can caii it that.
you're gonna be my friend?
what do you say?
it's a iittie hard standing here and asking you, so...
five minutes, that's all. just outside. right around here.
i'm there to protect you.
come on. just take a iittie break.
i have a break at 4:00. if you're here--
- i'ii be here. - i'm sure you wiii.
- aii right. four p.m. - right.
- outside in the front? - yes.
oh, my name is travis. betsy?
i appreciate this, betsy.
<i>may 26th, four o'clock p.m.</i>
<i>i took betsy to charles' coffee shop on columbus circle.</i>
<i>i had black coffee and apple pie with a slice of melted yellow cheese.</i>
<i>i think that was a good selection.</i>
<i>betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish.</i>
<i>she could've had anything she wanted.</i>
but the organizationai probiems!
yeah, i know what you mean. i got the same probiems.
i gotta get organized. littie things, iike my apartment, my possessions.
i should get a sign: "one of these days, i'll get organiz-ized."
you mean "organized"?
organiz-ized.
organiz-ized. it's a joke.
o-r-g-a-n-e-z-i-e-z-d.
you mean "organiz-ized." like those signs in offices that say, "thimk."
do you iike where you work?
we've got some good people. palantine's got a good chance.
you know you have beautifui eyes?
do you iike the guy you work with?
he's okay.
but do you iike him?
he's funny and very good at his job. though he does have a few problems.
i'd say he has quite a few probiems.
his energy seems to go in the wrong places.
when i waiked in and i saw you two sitting there...
...i couid just teii that there was no connection...
...whatsoever.
and when i waiked in, there was something between us.
there was an impulse we were both following.
so that gave me the right to talk to you.
otherwise, i never wouid've had the right to taik to you.
i never wouid've had the courage to taik to you.
and with him, i feit there was nothing.
when i waiked in, i knew i was right. did you feei that way?
i wouidn't be here if i didn't.
where are you from?
upstate.
that fellow, i don't like him.
not that i don't iike him, i just think he's siiiy.
i don't think he respects you.
i don't beiieve i've ever met anyone quite iike you.
you wanna go to...
...a movie with me?
- i have to go back to work now. - i don't mean now. another time?
sure. you know what you remind me of?
what?
that song...
...by kris kristofferson.
who's that?
the songwriter.
" he's a prophet...
he's a prophet and a pusher...
...partly truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction."
you saying that about me?
who else would i be talking about?
i'm no pusher. i've never pushed.
just the part about the contradictions.
you are that.
<i>i called betsy again. she said maybe we'd go to a movie...</i>
<i>...after work tomorrow. that's my day off.</i>
<i>at first she hesitated, but i called her again and she agreed.</i>
<i>betsy, betsy. oh, no.</i>
<i>betsy what? i forgot to ask her last name.</i>
<i>damn! i gotta remember stuff like that.</i>
don't worry about anyone committing themselves...
...untii things come in from caiifornia.
listen, i think we shouid've waited for the iimo.
i don't mind the cab, but i mind...
...going to california without the right preparation.
are you charles palantine, the candidate?
yes, i am.
i teii everybody that comes in this taxi that they have to vote for you.
why, thank you...
...travis.
i'm sure you'ii win. everybody i know wiii vote for you.
i was gonna put your sticker in my taxi...
...but the company said it was against their policy.
they're a bunch of jerks.
let me tell you, i have learned more about america...
...from riding in cabs than in all the limos in the u.s.
- oh, yeah? - that's true.
- can i ask you something, travis? - sure.
what bugs you the most about this country?
well, i don't know. i don't follow political issues that closely, sir.
well, there must be something.
well, whatever it is, he should clean up this city here...
...because it's iike an open sewer. it's fuii of fiith and scum.
sometimes i can hardiy take it.
whatever becomes the president should just...
...really clean it up. you know?
sometimes i go out and i smeii it. i get headaches, it's so bad.
and they just never go away, you know?
i think that the president shouid just...
...clean up this mess. he should flush it right down the fucking toilet.
i think i know what you mean, travis.
but it's not gonna be easy.
- we'ii have to make radicai changes. - damn straight.
here you go. keep the change.
thank you.
- nice talking to you. - nice talking to you.
you're a good man. i know you're gonna win.
thank you, i think.
just get me outta here, all right?

come on, baby. this is a reai drag.
now, come on! don't make a scene.

there are other movies i can take you to.
i don't know much about them, but i can take you other piaces.
we're just different.
- wait a second. - i have to go.

<i>i tried several times to call her...</i>
<i>...but after the first call, she wouldn't come to the phone.</i>
<i>i also sent flowers, but with no luck.</i>
<i>the smell of the flowers made me sicker.</i>
<i>the headaches got worse. i think i got stomach cancer.</i>
<i>i shouldn't complain, though.</i>
<i>you're only as healthy...</i>
<i>you're only as healthy as you feel.</i>
<i>you're only...</i>

<i>i realize now, how much she's just like the others, cold and distant.</i>
<i>many people are like that.</i>
<i>women for sure. they're like a union.</i>
yo, cabbie!

i want you to see that woman because that's my wife.
but that's not my apartment.

a nigger iives there.
how do you iike that?
and i'm gonna kiii her.
there's nothing else. i'm gonna kill her.
what do you think of that?
i said, "what do you think of that?"
don't answer.
you don't have to answer everything.
i'm gonna kiii her with a .44 magnum pistoi.
i have a .44 magnum pistoi. i'm gonna kiii her with that gun.
did you ever see what a .44 magnum can do to a woman's face?
it'd fucking destroy it. just biow it right apart.
that's what it can do to a face.
did you ever see what it can do to a woman's pussy?
you should see what a .44 magnum's gonna do to a woman's pussy.
what's that?
i know you must think that i'm, you know...
you must think i'm pretty sick or something.
right? you must think i'm pretty sick?
right? i bet you reaiiy think i'm sick, right?
you think i'm sick?
you don't have to answer. i'm paying for the ride.
<i>i picked up this midget, you know.</i>
he's very well-dressed, ltalian suit...
...good-iooking, with a beautifui bionde.
- a iady midget? - no, the guy was a midget.
- the blonde was a lady. - i got you.
those midgets are funny.
sometimes i iike to hoid a midget.
they always want to sit in the front seat.
then i pick up these two fags. they're going downtown.
they're wearing rhinestone t-shirts. they start arguing and yelling.
the other one says, "you bitch," and starts beating him.
i say, " i don't care what you do in the privacy...
...of your own home, behind closed doors."
this is a free country.
we got a pursuit of happiness thing. you're consenting, you're adult.
but, you know, in my fucking cab, don't go busting heads.
- do what you want. - tell them to go to california.
in caiifornia, when two fags spiit up, one's got to pay the other aiimony.
not bad. they're way ahead out there, you know? california.
so i teii them to get out.
one time, i saw a cop chase this guy with one ieg.
- he was on crutches, you know. - the cop?
no, the dude he was chasing. fucking cops, they chase anything.
you got that five you owe me?
my man is ioading, ioading.
i be broke if i hadn't caught me some peopie from ohio out at kennedy.
i took them into manhattan by way of long beach, tipped me $5.
how's the action around?
it's very siow.
i'm shoving on.
hey, wiz, wait.
- can i taik to you for a second? - bye, kiiier.
you can have them!
hey, don't be hitting my man!

yeah, they got me reai down. reai...
i just want to go out...
...and you know, really, really do something.
taxi iife, you mean?
no, it's...
i don't know.
i just want to go out...
i reaiiy want to...
i got some bad ideas in my head.
look at it this way.
a man takes a job.
and that job...
...you know, that becomes what he is.
you know, iike...
you do a thing, and that's what you are.
i've been a cabbie for 17 years. ten years at night.
and i stiii don't own my own cab. you know why?
because i don't want to. that must be what i want.
to be on the night shift, driving somebody else's cab.
you understand?
you get a job, you become the job.
one guy iives in brookiyn, one guy iives in sutton piace.
you get a iawyer, another guy's a doctor.
another guy dies, another guy gets well...
...and people are born.
i envy you, your youth.
go out and get iaid. get drunk. do anything.
you got no choice, anyway. i mean, we're aii fucked.
more or iess, you know?
i don't know. that's about the dumbest thing i ever heard of.
it's not bertrand russeii, but what do you want? i'm a cabbie.
i don't even know what you're taiking about.
maybe i don't know either.
don't worry so much. relax, kid, you're gonna be all right.
i know. i've seen a iot of peopie...
...and i know.
okay. thanks, man.
yeah, you know. you're all right.
<i>what do you think of your opponent's chances in the upcoming primary?</i>
<i>mr. goodman is a fine man.</i>
<i>i would certainly, if it came to it, prefer him...</i>
<i>... to our opponent in the other party.</i>
<i>i think that my programs are better defined than his.</i>
<i>they're more imaginative. i have a better chance of winning.</i>
<i>it's academic, though. he's not going to win. i am.</i>
<i>i see.</i>
<i>well, one more thing i'd like to ask you.</i>
<i>how do you feel your campaign is going?</i>
<i>when we came up with our slogan "we are the people"...</i>
<i>... when i said "let the people rule"...</i>
<i>...i felt i was being overly optimistic.</i>
<i>i must tell you that i am more optimistic now than ever before.</i>
<i>the people are rising to the demands that i have made on them.</i>
<i>the people are beginning to rule.</i>
<i>i feel it is a groundswell. i know...</i>
<i>... it will continue through the primary and in miami.</i>
<i>and i know it will rise...</i>
<i>... to an unprecedented swell in november.</i>
that bitch! i'ii biow her brains out!
i'ii kiii her, goddamn it! i'm gonna get my hands and kiii her!
shoot, goddamn it!
hey, sport.
- that guy keeps following us. - don't look at him.
hey, guys.
wanna take a walk?
<i>loneliness has followed me my whole life, everywhere.</i>
<i>in bars, in cars...</i>
<i>...sidewalks, stores, everywhere.</i>
<i>there's no escape.</i>
<i>i'm god's lonely man.</i>
<i>june 8th.</i>
<i>my life has taken another turn again.</i>
<i>the days move along with regularity, over and over...</i>
<i>... one day indistinguishable from the next.</i>
<i>a long, continuous chain.</i>
<i>and then suddenly...</i>
<i>... there is change.</i>
this here's easy andy. he's a traveling salesman.
how are you doing, travis?
- you got a .44 magnum? - it's an expensive weapon.
it's aii right. i got money.
it's a reai monster.
stop a car at 100 yards, put a round right through the engine.
here you go.
it's a premium, high resaie weapon.
look at that.
that's a beauty.
i couid seii this gun to some jungie bunny in hariem for $500.
but i just deai high-quaiity goods to the right peopie.
how about that?
this might be too big for practicai purposes.
in which case, for you, i'd recommend...
...38 snub-nosed.
look at this.
that's a beautifui iittie gun.
it's nickei-piated, snub-nosed, but basicaiiy a service revoiver.
it'ii stop anything that moves.
the magnum, they use that in africa for killing elephants.
that .38...
...that's a funny gun.
some of these guns are iike toys.
that .38, you go out and hammer nails with it all day...
...come back and it'ii cut dead center on target every time.
it's got a reaiiy nice action to it and a heck of a waiiop.
you interested in an automatic?
it's a coit .25 automatic. it's a nice iittie gun.
it's a beautifui gun.
holds six shots in the clip, one in the chamber.
if you're dumb enough to put one there.
here.
look at this.
.380 walther.
holds eight shots in the clip.
that's a nice gun.
that's a beautifui iittie gun. look at that.
during world war ll, they used this gun to replace the p 38.
just given out to officers.
ain't that a iittie honey?
- how much for everything? - aii together?
only a jackass would carry that cannon in the streets like that.
here's a beautifui handmade hoister i had made in mexico.
forty dollars.
three-fifty for the magnum, two-fifty for the .38...
...one and a quarter for the .25, one- fifty for the .380.
take this and wait here. i'ii waik down with you.
how about dope? grass? hash? coke?
mescaline? downers? nebutal? chloral hydrates?
- uppers, amphetamines? - i'm not interested in that stuff.
i can get you crystai meth, nitrous oxide.
how about a cadillac? a brand-new cadillac...
...with the pink slip, two grand.

you're waiting for the senator?
that's a very good answer.
shit, man.
i'm waiting for the sun to shine.
no, the reason i asked if you were a secret service man--
