seeking justice

bourdette?
are you wasting my time?
if they find out
i'm talking to you, they'll
they'll kill me.

no, this is...
- this is wrong. this is insane.
- whoa, whoa.
you're doing the right thing
the brave thing.

rabbit jumps mean?

- happy anniversary.
so where are we five years from now?
right here at the lafitte hotel except
we have a babysitter at home.
i like that.
- me too.
- a babysitter
blond, about 19 swedish
and he's very handsome.
don't fuck with me.
plunge to his death today off the roof
of a parking structure on burgundy street.
- we're going live to the scene.
- it's where i parked my car.
joining me is lieutenant durgan
with the nopd.
you think we have a murder victim here?
i'm not gonna comment at this time
but i will tell you that nopd
is gonna do everything in its power
- to get to the bottom of this.
- yeah, right, another unsolved case.
- i know what's happening.
- it's new orleans.
- the city's going in hell.
- oh, come on, we love new orleans.
who dat?
well, the city may be going to hell
but we are going dancing.
that's right.
- hey, can i ask you something?
- yeah.
how did you two meet?
i'll bet it was really juicy and romantic.
- no, not really.
- i thought it was.
well...
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
stop. it's a "well"?
i know it's a "well".
oh, he was sitting with all these kids
like, 14-15 year olds.
their first time at symphony
you could tell.
- and they were actually listening.
- one or two of them.
you know i just thought it was incredible
what he was doing for those kids.
bullshit! those, no, listen,
those kids were juvenile delinquents.
they were supposed to be in detention
and will was supposed
to supervise but instead
this son of a bitch uses his own
hard-earned cash
to take them to a concert.
- they are my students.
- of course, you do.
some bad ass kids.
oh, it's not "ow!". it's aaaw!
- what? ...what?
- close your eyes.
where are you going?
don't look at me.
- come back.
- close your eyes.
close your eyes.
tight.
okay.
put out your hands.
what are you going to do?
unspeakable things.
happy anniversary.
oh...
it's beautiful.
i didn't think
you've gotten me anything.
of course, i got you something.
they're little rubies.
thank you.
i love you.
one at a time, please.
one at a time.
phone, beepers, knives, guns.
if it rings hand it.
hand over the phone, edwin.
- what phone? i'm clean.
- and the beeping is?
- thank you. mr. will.
- mr. jimmy.
- hey, are we still on for tonight?
- you're going down.
keep dreaming.
remember if your phone to school,
your parents...
the expense of spirit in a waste
of shame is lust in action.
and till action, lust is perjured
murderous, bloody, full of blame
savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust.
you see what shakespeare's doing here?
he's using words to create emotions.
what kind of words are these?
they're violent words.
and why is this important?
because when you feel angry, when you
wanna punch somebody in the face
you put it on paper instead.
you find words that evoke emotions in you
and you do something positive with it.
edwin.
i could have sworn i saw the principal
take the phone from you this morning.
guess what?
if you applied yourself half as much to
class as you do to scamming the school
you could accomplish anything.
ready to suffer?
bring it on.
- thank you.
- i'll see you. / i'll see you.
i'm this way.
- goodnight.
- bye. / bye.
bitch, huh?
get in!
really.
check mate and mate, mate.
i didn't see that coming.
yo, your problem,
my man, is you play it too safe.
you gotta take some chances,
you know, play not to lose.
pretty much ensures defeat.
set 'em up, asshole.
- all right, good play.
- all right.
- goodnight, jimmy.
- goodnight.
i'm here to see laura gerard.
i'm her husband.
mr. gerard, if you would follow me.
i've been caring for your wife
ever since she came in.
we've be keeping her pretty
sedated on pain medication.
she has several deep lacerations,
internal bleeding.
we're keeping a close watch on her.
lieutenant richards, nopd.
she gave us description.
we're working up a composite likeness.
we're gonna get there.
could you all give me a moment
with my wife? please?
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
i wanted to her to come out with us.
hey, will.
i'm so sorry.
the son of the bitch
who did this to laura
they're gonna find him.
go home, jimmy. it's late.
- i'll be all right.
- anything you need, man, okay?
- anything. you just call me.
- thanks.
close your own eyes. tight.
thank you.
i'm sorry to hear about your wife.
sounds terrible.
laura, right?
is she okay?
- are you with the police?
- no.
no, but i, um...
a couple of years ago,
i experienced something similar.
so it's probably
what you're going through right now.
- you did?
- yeah.
the man who raped your wife,
he was, uh...
he was paroled three weeks ago.
you know who did this?
he's done it before, he'll do it again.
if you want...
we can take care of him for you.
take care of who?
what do you mean arrest him?
uh, well, if we hand him
over to the police
it'll take at least six months
for dna tests to be completed.
ultimately there would be a trial
which your wife
assuming she didn't drop
the charges would be...
dragged through
this nightmare over and over.
she'll be in court.
she'll be questioned by the lawyers.
and even if the da gets a conviction
which is not guaranteed
the rapist can serve
as little as 11 months
you know which is half the time
you get for tax evasion.
who are you?
i'm simon.
i represent an organization that, uh...
that deals with people.
like the man that raped your wife
we would very much like
to take care of him for you.
i really don't know
what you're talking about.
you know what i'm talking about.
this wouldn't cost you
anything financially.
i mean if you did want us
to deal with this, uh
we may ask a favor of you
at some point in the future.
look after somebody
for a couple of hours
or break a security camera,
make a phone call or just
something that would help us out.
you...
you know where he is?
we do but we have a time issue
so, uh, we would have to...
get an answer from you pretty quickly.
listen.
we're just a few citizens
who are seeking justice.
you know we love the city.
we're tired of watching it go to hell.
no.
no.
okay. that's okay.
you take care.
wait.
there's a row of vending machines
in the oncology department cafeteria.
if you want this to happen,
select the forever bar.
buy two of them, okay?
two of them.
and, mr. gerard, we never spoke.
you never met me. okay?
you do not repeat
this conversation to anybody.
- so, you got the healthy ones, huh?
- excuse me?
i just figured
if you're going to have a treat
you should have
something that's worth it, huh?
hey. cool, man.
it's all right.
what the fuck...?
what do you want?
you raped a woman tonight.
your wife?
i have no wife.
i don't know who she is.
my wife was murdered three months ago
by some scumbag just like you.
yeah. yeah.
kirksey funeral homes.
the hungry rabbit jumps.
mr. gerard?
- mr. gerard?
- yes.
we need you to sign a few more
insurance forms, please.
i talked to the police this morning.
they found the rapist.
he's dead.
committed suicide.
we'll find a way to get over this
together.
i know.
- i'm sorry.
- no.
don't say that.
it's just hard.
sweetheart, that man is gone.
- i want a new lock on the door.
- okay.
and bars on the windows.
will?
yeah, just me.
- did you lock the door?
- doors locked.
i sound like a crazy person.
no, you sound like a person
who's getting over something difficult.
i wanna buy a gun.
we're not keeping a gun in this house.
no guns.
all right. if your stance is not stable
you're not gonna be stable.
remember feet shoulder-width apart
knees slightly bent.
lean forward at the waist.
bring the gun to your eyesight.
you got that front sight, rear sight.
squeeze the trigger.
there's your pepper spray.
remember, squeeze the trigger.
- take care.
- thanks.
oh, on you i missed.
- well, you still have to make it.
- all right,
- side pocket.
- oh, no. a lot of green, laura.
a lot of green.
- oh, good game, honey.
- you're a pool shark.
you noticed.
all right, let's go again.
i'll give you a chance to even the score.
- all right, i'll rack 'em, you grab drinks.
- fine. good idea.
hello?
will? come outside.
i need to talk to you.
- who is this?
- it's simon. i have to talk to you.
come outside.
just tell laura, it's your sister.
- hello?

what do you think?
there is a, uh, mailbox
at the entrance of the zoo.
and we would like you
to go there tomorrow after work
and mail this at exactly 4:15.
what is it?
it's a letter to santa claus.
santa claus?
- and then i'm even?
- well, that's not up to me.
well, who's it up to?
all i know is i need you to mail that
where did you go?
well, my sister called. it was too noisy
in here so i had to step outside.
- are you okay?
- yeah, everything's fine.
- fine.
- play again? double or nothing?
no. i'm real tired. let's go.
- okay?
- okay.
yes?
- you're in the mailbox?
- i am.
open the letter.
okay. hold on.
- okay.
- go to the zoo.
pay for the ticket with cash
and wait by the entrance.
if the woman and the girls show up,
you follow them. if that man appears,
and say, "the hungry rabbit jumps."
- you got it?
- the hungry rabbit jumps.
that's right.
- what does it mean?
- it means what it means.
now, memorize the number
and their pictures
and tear up that sheet
until it's confetti.
you got it?
okay, good luck.
i wanna welcome you to the zoo
and to our elephant show.
we have two elephants here
in the audobon zoo both asian females.
this is jean.
she is 36 years old
and she weighs 7600 pounds.
anya is 45
and she's 10,400 pounds.
what we're gonna show you today
are a few behaviors
that the elephants know
and things that we need
to do daily to take a look at 'em
to make sure they're healthy
and doing well.
what you're looking at?
i've seen bitch.
all right! all right.
nobody's looking at anybody.
- settle down. come on.

- why? i don't get this.
- no need to shout, will. i'm right here.
i've done everything you asked
- the santa claus letter, the zoo...
- the man didn't show up?
no, i don't think so but,
look, i'm finished.
will, you've been very helpful
and we appreciate it.
but what you've done
is only part of it, okay?
- we just need you to do one more thing.
- i think you made a mistake here.
i'm not cut out to the kind of activity.
- yeah?
- i hope you're right.
will, a promise is a promise, okay?
i'll be in touch.
- oh.
- excuse me. hey, now, my bad, brother.

we finished rehearsal early today.
you wanna go out for dinner?

- i assume you got the package.
yes.
okay, tomorrow morning
you'll have an issue with your car
and take the number 7
broad street bus to school
get off at the earhart boulevard stop.
you'll see a pedestrian ramp that
goes down to the ground level.
walczak takes the bus to work.
he arrives about 8:15.
wait for him on the ramp.
as he passes
you're gonna bump him and knock him
over the edge. it'll be easy.
there's a low rail.
it's gonna look like a suicide.
now, there's two security cameras
that cover that spot.
but don't worry about them,
they're both disabled.
- when it's done, you call me.
- no, i am done.
- will...
- i followed that woman, those girls.
i'm done.
all you have to say is
"the hungry rabbit jumps."
you got it?
the hungry rabbit jumps.
- what are you doing out here?
- i can't get reception inside.
what is it?
does it have something to do with me?
i read that sometimes
the partner of the victim
has trouble readjusting.
oh, god, no, no.
we're fine.
then what is it?
- will, whatever it is, you can tell me.
- it's nothing. i love you.
so take the number 7
broad street bus to school
get off at the earhart boulevard.
walczak takes the bus to work.
he arrives about 8:15.
you'll see a pedestrian ramp
that goes down to the ground level.
it'll be easy. there's a low rail.
it's gonna look like a suicide.
- hey, you're late.
- i'm sorry.
but you're never late.
okay, i get it.
how many times
do you want me to apologize?
and i wished that i had died
and far into the night
he crooned that tune.
the stars went out
and so did the moon.
the singer stopped playing
and went to bed
while the weary blues echoed
through his head.
he slept like a rock
or man that's dead.
what happened?
you backed out?
i told you i couldn't do it.
will, you know
what a child pornographer does.
he arranges for adult men to
have sex with children in videotapes it.
i get it. he's the scum of the earth.
needs to get what's coming to him.
but i'm not the guy to do it.
i am not a killer.
- will, let's not forget what we did for you.
- i wasn't myself that night.
nobody said anything in the agreement
about killing anybody.
so get the hell out of my life.
why would someone slash our tires?
but how did they even get
into the garage area?
it wouldn't be all that difficult.
what's the matter?
nothing.
but why are you acting so weird?
- why does somehow...
- will?
will gerard?
i thought it was you.
simon adams.
we taught over bartram together.
- remember?
- right.
- hey, simon.

i got out. i moved to seattle.
i'm just back consoling a friend. his, uh...
his wife got murdered.

it really shouldn't have happened.
well, would you like to join us,
simon, have a drink?

i, uh,
i don't wanna intrude.
- don't tell me you're a teacher too, laura?
- i'm a musician.
- nice. love to hear you play.
- simon.
not to be rude but laura and i were
actually having a private meal together.
of course.
yeah, i understand.
nice to meet laura.
it's funny how people come in
and out of each others' lives.
don't you think?
call me, will.

it's terrible about his friend's
about his friend's wife being murdered.
what the hell are you doing?

yeah, i'm a little tense, detective.
in my situation, should i be relaxed?
i have rehearsal.
- marshy!
- marshy!
- marshy!
- marshy!
nobody takes a story like you.
you were the best.
but jesus, marshy, you could have picked
a more dignified way to go out.
you escaped from a chechen jail.
you survived your own divorce,
for crying out loud.
just barely.
and that piece you wrote about
the music industry that was beautiful.
gorgeous story.
marshy, here's to you.
- you're the real deal.
- amen, brother.
you redheaded, asshole!
- here, here!
- here's a little music for marshy.
- we're having a toast to marshy.
- marshy!
and to our new best friend
as long as he keeps buying.
- will.
- will.
- marshy was a great guy, huh?
- he was one hell of a journalist.
a couple of weeks ago
we had lunch and, uh
- weirdest thing happened.
- what's that, he paid?
no, he, uh, he tells me
about the secret organization. some...
group that claims to hand out justice
you know,
when the justice system fails and...
- he told you that?
- oh, it's true.
they killed him,
made it look like a suicide.
you better watch your back there, will.
because anybody associated
with marshy is a marked man.
- and why do they want him dead?
- because...
joe, you tell him.
because alan marsh...
was an alien.
he was sent here as a scout
to prepare for the invasion of earth.
so, will you... you are now obligated
to buy us another round.
absolutely.
augie!
don't worry about it, will.
he's been telling that crazy story to everybody.
he went so far as even hiding
his own research.
where'd he hide it?
well, that would be the $64-million
question, wouldn't it?
cheers.
well, he was obsessed.
i mean he said he was about to
make that all stuff public.
the truth is, i mean, alan...
- he had some issues.
- yeah, it got worse.
one of the sources got bumped off.
and after that, i don't know, man.
he just he became like, uh...
- different man.
- yeah.
jumpy, paranoid, lying son of a bitch.
just sort of like you, will.
so what are you, a cop?
next time you wanna come snooping
around show your badge
and don't pretend to be his friend.
will.
- stop him!
- hey, will!
will, come back. i wanna talk to you.
go after him. get in the car.
go, get him.
he went over himself.
get down. get down below.
will?
no need to run, will.
i have something that
i think you may want.
it's the tape from the security camera.
i just wanna show you.
i have it right here.
why don't you come out?
i'll show it to you.
come on, will.
will, come on out.
it's very clear you didn't kill anybody.
i just want to sell it to you.
will?
hey!
goddammit!
mrs. gerard...
i'm detective sims of the new orleans
police department.
would you come with me, please?
- now what?
- your husband, mrs. gerard.
we just found out some new information
that indicates he's innocent.
you do?
we need your help to get him out
of this mess. come with me, please.
of course.
so what's this new evidence?
- excuse me?
- you said there was new evidence.
we'll show you
when we get down the station.
man, mother fucker!
the wireless customer
you are calling is not available.
please try again later.
hey!
in a hyphenated compound situation
do you capitalize the second word?
only if it's a noun and the words
have equal weight
like, "homeland security".
if it's a participle modifying the first word then
you better,
uh... you better keep it lower case.
huh, yeah, it makes sense.
thanks.
edmund burke.
"a philosophical enquiry."
it is not what a lawyer tells me
i may do but what
humanity, reason,
and justice tell me i ought to do.
there's a guy in the news room
going through alan marsh's desk.
i've never seen him before.
look.
where'd he go?
i'm telling you he was right there.
eight sixty five, eight sixty five.
eight sixty five,
here we go 865.
be right back, sir.
thank you, sir.
by the way, this is a nice car.
thank you.
paris truck stop.
paris truck stop.
paris truck stop.
paris truck stop.
twenty one and one paris road.
all right, let's try that.
i wonder if you could help me.
i worked for the new orleans post.
and i'm looking a missing colleague.
i know he would come here
to get gas and supplies.
do you recognize him?
i've seen him.
he goes fishing on the weekends.
he keeps his boat in one of those
units over there.
which unit?
but i haven't seen him in a few days.
the truth is, uh
well, he owes me quite a bit of money.
is there any way to get in that unit?
well, uh, no, i don't have the keys.
i mean those storage units
have nothing to do with me.
so there's no other possible way
i can in there and get what's owed me?
well, it looks like they're made out
of some pretty cheap shit.
i saw some guy accidentally
backed into one.
it went right through the door.
really?
- so he went right through it?
- right through.
i really appreciate your understanding
of my situation.
well, we're all god's children.
hey, good morning.
you know if they find out
i'm talking to you, they're gonna kill me.
what does the hungry
rabbit jumps mean?
it's not what a lawyer tells me
i must do
but it's what humanity,
reason and justice tell me i ought to do.
edmund burke said it.
hungry-humanity.
rabbit-reason.
jumps-justice.
humanity, reason, justice.
well, it was just supposed to be the worst.
you know rapists, murderers
child molesters. but then...
simon he started widening the net.
anybody he designated as
"unworthy of living"
who's simon?
he runs my cell.
i don't know his real name.
- tell me about how your cell works.
- uh, it's just handful of men.
uh, simon gives us our orders.
he gets his from higher up. i mean
the idea is that if complications arise
then the cell can be cut off
without a threat to the organization.
we also use people
who have made a deal with us
who owes us a favor.
hey, look
i got into this because i was sick
of seeing the city rot.
i wanted to help. i wanted to
make it a livable place for my family
my two little girls.
okay? but now it's... it's wrong.
simon's out of control
and i have no way
for talking anybody higher
in the organization.
oh, god.
- what is it, mr. bourdette?
- i can't. this is wrong.
whoa!
mr. bourdette?
november 3rd, this is alan marsh.
will, jesus, man,
everybody's looking...
- christ, what the hell is going on?
- i know, jimmy.
- what the fuck do you know?
- i saw the pictures.
you and simon.
- you're part of this.
- look, okay. will,
okay, listen to me, okay?
i'm a part of the organization, okay?
i joined 15 years ago
when my brother got killed.
they didn't even test the bastard.
i had to do something so i'm sorry.
the fucking scumbag that raped laura
i wanted him crucified.
who set me up for the murder
of that reporter, huh?
- was it you, you fuck?
- i called durgan
told him to let you go.
that was me.
what's simon's real name?
will, i can't tell you that.
you have no idea
what this guy is capable of.
his name.
- i'm your fucking friend.
- no!
you're simon's friend.
you tell me his fucking name.
what's his name?
get out of the car!
get out of the car now!
- open the seatbelt.
- get out of the car!
okay.
fuck you pedophile.
the hungry rabbit jumps.
- the hungry rabbit jumps.
- the hungry rabbit jumps.
how long have you been following me?
answer me!
not long. just from that house
on seaborne street.
i was just told to wait for you there.
and if you turned up
and i was to follow you and...
why did you agree to kill me?
i owed him.
he killed the man
who murdered my sister.
simon?
- what's his mobile number?
- it's in my cellphone.
get up.
- get up!
- don't kill me, please. please don't kill...
get up! give me the phone.
get outta here, go!
what does hungry rabbit jumps mean?
"it's not what a lawyer tells me
i must do..."
yeah?
eugene cook
head of the rj allen group.
- will?
- you framed me.
you framed me for the murder
of alan marsh.
i also know that
you had bourdette killed.
watch.
the hungry rabbit jumps mean...
"it's not what a lawyer tells me
i must do but it's what..."
and there's more.
very resourceful.
i want the security tape
from the overpass.
the one that shows i didn't kill marsh.
so i've got something you want
and now it looks like
you've got something i want.
we should trade.
here's what's going to happen.
you're going to meet me
at the super dome
five o'clock tonight.
you bring the tape.
- eugene cook.
- there'll be a prepaid ticket in your name.
go to your assigned seat
and wait for me there.
hey, trudy, i need to talk to you.
can i come in?
yeah, sure.
by hiding out, she is not helping will.
and she may be charged with aiding
and abetting a fugitive
or even as an accessory to murder.
- do you...
- i'm sorry, jimmy. i don't know.
she's not answering her cell.
she's not returning my calls.
you're her best friend, right?
you know her better than
maybe anyone else in the whole world.
if you were in her shoes,
where would you go?
will?
- who is it?
- laura? where's jimmy?
- how did you...?
- can i come in?
where's will?
will?
i'm here.
- where are you?
- get up on your seat
and head towards the concourse.
- what?
- get up and head toward the concourse.
- yeah?
- go out on to the concourse.
you'll see a men's room.
go in.
yeah?
take a leak.
- yeah?
- go to the hot-dog stand
and buy yourself a hot-dog.
having fun?
look at you
- trying not to kill a child pornographer.
- he wasn't a child pornographer.
oh, but you didn't know that.
you must be a good man, will.
an endangered species.
- but where is the actual security tape?
- yeah?
good.
sent me a picture.
it's with your wife.
this time jimmy's done a good job.
now where's my dvd?
i don't have it on me.
i'll tell you where it is
when i get my wife.
well, she's in the abandoned mall
next door.
let's go see her.
you believe they
haven't fixed this place up
all these years after the hurricane?
laura.
sorry, buddy.
you left me no choice.
let her go.
did you make copies of this thing?
- no.
- now that's good.
'cause if you did, i'm gonna fly to philly
and find your sister and her two little kids
- and tell them a really scary bedtime story.
- you have what you want.
please let her go.
what i do is so important
to jeopardize. i'm sorry.
so you and laura are not gonna
walk outta here today.
you're insane.
what did you say?
i said i think you're sick.
on the contrary, i am very well.
you don't see it, do you?
the city and how close
we are to absolute chaos?
jimmy sees it.
don't you, jimmy?
sick, i'm not sick.
the sick ones are sitting on their fat,
fucking asses eating and
drinking and fucking themselves
into a stupor.
polluting the world without a second
thought while it goes down the toilet.
nobody wants
to do the nasty work, will.
you know the shit that
we all just think about.
most good citizens
are just along for the ride
and they fucking bitch and moan
and complain about everything
when it doesn't work out.
but not me.
get it done.
will!
what the fuck, jimmy?
you promised not to hurt them!
we didn't get into this organization
to kill innocent people.
laura, run!
you're happy now?
will!
will!
so jimmy's dead, huh?
eugene cook killed him.
who killed eugene cook?
i did.
i don't think so.
here's what happened.
eugene cook
and jimmy killed each other.
i don't even think you two were here.
simple case of a dead man
killing a dead man.
you don't suppose i could interest you
in joining our organization.
- no.
- you sure?
well, if you have a change of heart
you know where to find me, right?
now, i think you two better
get the hell outta here.
lieutenant.
the story you just told us
is that how it's going to be?
this is new orleans.
yeah, that's how it's gonna be.
go on.
breaking news, we're going live
to catherine james
on the scene.
detective, the bodies of four males were
found shot in that abandoned mall.
can you tell us what happened?
i'm not gonna comment in the middle
of an ongoing investigation.
but i can tell you
nopd is gonna do everything
in its power to get to the bottom of it.
in other news, prosecutors have dropped all
charges against school teacher will gerard
who was accused of murdering
the new orleans post reporter alan marsh.
a security tape uncovered by the nopd
clearly proves that gerard
did not kill alan marsh
and, in fact, was trying to defend himself
when marsh attacked him on the walkway
under the broad street overpass.
this is for you.
it's marsh's research. it's just a start.
thanks, will.
he just scratched the surface
and i thought someone should finish it.
i'll give it a look.
the hungry rabbit jumps, eh?
