so there we are.
a good company, you think?
modestly successful.
i know nothing about

i was just the accountant.

wouldn't you think?
change the machines around,
whatever you do...
you could make other things,
couldn't you?
field kits, mess kits.
army contracts.

it, but for now it's great.
you can make a fortune,

i think most people right now
have other priorities.

i'm sure you'll do just fine
once you get the contracts.
in fact, the worse things get,
the better you'll do.
well, i can get the signatures i need.
that's the easy part.
finding the money to buy
the company, that's hard.
you don't have any money?
not that kind of money.
you know anybody?
jews, yeah. investors.
you must have contacts in
the jewish business community,
working here.
what community? jews can
no longer own businesses.
that's why this
one's in receivership.
but they wouldn't own it.
i'd own it. i'd pay them back
in product, pots and pans.
pots and pans.
something they can use.
something they can
feel in their hands.
they can trade it
on the black market,
do whatever they want.
everybody's happy.
if you want, you could
run the company for me.
let me understand.
they'd put up
all the money,
i'd do all the work.
what, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do?
i'd make sure it's known
the company's in business.
i'd see that it had
a certain panache.
that's what i'm good at, not the work.
not the work.

the standard ss rate for jewish skilled

this is what you pay
the reich economic office.
the jews themselves
receive nothing.
poles you pay wages. generally,
they get a little more.
are you listening?
what was that about the ss?
the rate? the what?
the jewish worker's salary.
you pay it
directly to the ss,
not to the worker.
he gets nothing.
but it's less.
it's less than what
i would pay a pole.
it's less.
that's the point i'm trying to make.
poles cost more.

why should i hire poles?
an enamelware factory

it's owned by a german.

"everybody remembers him."
"he did something
extraordinary."
"he did something
no one else did."
"he came here with nothing,
a suitcase,
and built a bankrupt company
into a major manufactory."
"and left with
a steamer trunk."
"two steamer
trunks full of money."
"all the riches
of the world."
hmm.
it's comforting to see
that nothing's changed.
you're wrong, emilie.
there's no way i could
have known this before,
but there was
always something missing.
in every business i tried, i can
see now, it wasn't me that failed.
something was missing.
even if i'd known what it was, there's
nothing i could have done about it,
because you can't
create this thing.
and it makes all the difference in the
world between success and failure.

<i>hauptscharführer, this gentleman
thinks a mistake's been made.</i>
my plant manager is
somewhere on this train.
if it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production
and the armaments board
will want to know why.
<i>man on loudspeaker: achtung,
dieser zug fährt jetzt ab.</i>
is he on the list?
yes, sir. itzhak stern.
well, the list is correct, sir.
there is nothing i can do.
what is your name?
<i>soldier on pa:
close and secure all doors.</i>
<i>my name? my name is kunder.
this train is now leaving.</i>
kunder.
hauptscharführer kunder.
k-u-n-d-e-r.
and what's yours?
schindler.
s-c-h-i-n-d-l-e-r.
gentlemen, thank you very much.
i think i can guarantee you
you'll both be
in southern russia before the
end of the month. good day.
<i>conductor: zamykac dokladnie drzwi.

(coughing)
my apologies.

he's here!
i apologize.
stop the train!
stop the train! stop it!
sign here.
initial there.
(whistle blowing)
makes no difference to us, you understand.
this one, that one.
(train whistle blowing) it's
the inconvenience to the list.
it's the paperwork.
i somehow left my
work card at home.
i tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but...
i'm sorry, it was stupid!
what if i got here
five minutes later?
then where would i be?
<i>sacrean, sacrean end tzukeer.</i>
<i>tzukeer end sacrean.</i>
i woke up from
a dream this morning.
i was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people i didn't know,
only to discover i
was broke and sharing
a room with 12
people i didn't know.
(chuckling) you laugh about it?
i have to laugh.
you are living behind walls.
the walls i can deal with. it's the
restrictions to my life i'm tired of.
those walls keep them out.
that's all i care about.
i like it here. there's
a kind of, i don't know,
ancestral squalor to it all.
you are a slave to these people.
no one envies us anymore.
i'm smart.
oh, yes, you're smart.
you're a real genius.
you had your chance.
today, today i actually found
time to organize a thought.
i can't remember
the last time i did that.
when's the last
time we did this?
when's the last time
we stood around and talked?
no one ordered me
onto a truck today.
no one took my
business away from me.
you don't really
have a business to take.
there's nowhere down from here.
this is it.
this is the bottom.
the ghetto is liberty.
this street divides the ghetto
just about in half.
right side, ghetto a, civil employees,
industrial workers, and so on.
left side,
ghetto b, surplus labor,
the elderly and infirm, mostly.
which is where you
will want to start.
do you have any questions, sir?
<i>ja, why is the top down?
i'm fucking freezing.</i>
kunde: we expect a labor
force of 25,000 to 30,000.
segregated, of course. the men
in the barracks near the quarry.
the women on
the other side of the wire.
goeth: my place is where?
there, sir.
there?
yes, the villa.
you call that a villa?
their synagogue,
can you see it?
that's not a villa.
we're planning to turn it
into the camp stables.
it's a house.
goeth: what's that over there?
kunde: kindergarten.
fifty-one.
and we have a dentist,
shoemaker, practical physicians.
there they are, sir.
(sniffs) hmm.
one of you is
a very lucky girl.
there is an opening
for a job away from all
this backbreaking
work at my new villa.
(sniffs)
uh...
which of you has
domestic experience?
<i>ja, on second thought, i don't
really want someone else's maid.</i>
all those annoying
habits i have to undo.
(chuckles) i don't want
to give you my cold.
what's your name?
helen hirsch.
what?
helen hirsch.
(coughing)
what? i can't hear.
helen hirsch.
<i>ja.</i>
woman: take it all down!
(officer blows whistle)
officer: to work!
woman: take it down!
it is not safe!
she says the foundation was poured wrong.
she's got to take it down.
i told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking hotel europa.
fucking jew bitch engineer.
you fucking bitch!
<i>herr kommandant.
the entire foundation</i>
has to be torn
down and re-poured.
if not, there will be
at least a subsidence
at the southern
end of the barracks.
subsidence, and then collapse.
and you are an engineer?
yes.
my name is diana reiter.
i'm a graduate of civil engineering
from the university of milan.
an educated jew,
like karl marx himself.
<i>unterscharführer!
jawohl?</i>
shoot her.
what?
(gasps)
<i>herr kommandant,
i'm only trying to do my job.</i>
<i>ja, i'm doing mine.</i>
but, sir, she's
foreman of construction.
we are not going to have
arguments with these people.
okay.
no. shoot her here,
on my authority.
it will take more than that.
goeth: i'm sure you're right.
take it down, re-pour it, rebuild it.
like she said.
we have more to see, but we have
only one more hour of light.
(humming)
<i>goeth: today is history.</i>
<i>today will be remembered.</i>
years from now, the young will
ask with wonder about this day.
today is history,
and you are part of it.
six hundred years ago,
<i>(singing morning prayer) when
elsewhere they were footing the blame</i>
<i>for the black death,
kazimierz the great...</i>
<i>ke laolam chasedo</i>
<i>...so-called, told the jews
they could come to krakow.</i>
<i>they came.</i>
not that fat. no, less.
<i>they trundled their
belongings into the city.</i>
yes, a bit less.
<i>they settled.</i>
<i>they took hold.</i>
<i>they prospered in business,
science, education, the arts.</i>
<i>they came here with nothing.</i>
(praying continues)
<i>nothing.</i>
<i>and they flourished.</i>
<i>for six centuries there
has been a jewish krakow.</i>
<i>think about that.</i>
<i>by this evening,</i>
<i>those six
centuries are a rumor.</i>
they never happened.
today is history.

please, everybody, sit down.
how are you doing?
oskar schindler.
we started without you.
fine. i miss anything good?
<i>i was explaining to herr bosch
and herr madritsch</i>
some of the benefits of moving
their factories into plaszow.
i meant the food.
(chuckles)
since your labor
is housed on-site,
it's available to
you at all times.
you can work them
all night if you want.
your factory policies,
whatever they've
been in the past,
they'll continue to be.
they'll be respected.
i have to know,
where do you get a suit
like that?
what is that? is that silk?
of course.
<i>ja.</i>
it has a nice sheen about it.

very nice.
i'd say i'd get you one, but the

no.
they're not gone.
they're here.
they're mine! every day that
goes by, i'm losing money.
every worker that is
shot costs me money.
i have to find somebody else.
i have to train them.
we are going to be
making so much money
that none of this
is going to matter.
it's bad business.
(sniffs)
thank you.
leave the bottle.
take that.
lena, thank you.
scherner told me
something else about you.
yeah? what's that?
that you know the meaning
of the word "gratitude."
that it's not some
vague thing with you
like it is with others.
you want to stay where you are.
you've got things
going on the side.
things are good.
you don't want anybody
telling you what to do.
i can understand all that, you know.
i know you.
what you want is
your own sub-camp.
do you have any idea what is involved?
the paperwork alone,
and then you've got to
build the fucking thing.
getting the fucking permits is
enough to drive you crazy.
then the engineers show up,
they stand around, they argue
about drainage, foundations,
codes, exact specifications,
parallel fences
four kilometers long,
barbed wire, (chuckling)
fences, ceramic insulators,
three cubic meters of
air space per prisoner.
i'm telling you, you want to shoot somebody.
i've been through it,
you know? i know.
well, you know. you've
been through it. (spits)

<i>yugoslavia, herr kommandant.</i>
i've got to make room.
make me a hinge.
yes, sir.
(guards muttering)
keep going, you're doing well.
oh, that's very good.
but i'm a bit confused,
and perhaps you can help me.
what i don't understand
is that you've been working
since i think, what,
about 6:00 this morning?
yet, such a small pile
of hinges.
(train whistle blows)
(gun clicks)
(gun clicks) oh, christ.
may i try that, sir?
check the angle lever.
maybe it's bent.
no, no. you wouldn't hear a click
if it was the angle lever.
maybe it's the pin.
maybe the pin shaft is greasy.
ja, come on.
what did i just say? here.
(gun clicks)
<i>herr kommandant.</i>
i beg to report that my heap of
hinges was so unsatisfactory
because the machines were being
recalibrated this morning.
(gun clicks)
i was put on to shoveling coal.
(gun clicking)
(grunts)
(yells)
(sobbing)
strange, huh?
yeah.
thank you, muek.
ah, lisiek. don't touch the
leather, it's just been oiled.
<i>rottenführer.
oh, for me?</i>
<i>oh, thank you very much,
herr direktor.</i>
<i>stern: herr direktor!</i>
<i>herr direktor!</i>
<i>herr direktor.</i>
he was making hinges slowly.
so the man can
turn out a hinge in
less than a minute.
why the long story?
hmm?
(machines whirring)
thank you, sir.
you're welcome.
nobody knows who
stole the chicken, hmm?
tell him about the chicken.
a man walks around with a chicken
and nobody notices this.
save yourselves.
tell him about the chicken.
still nobody knows.
(sobbing)
it was you.
you committed this crime.
no, sir.
but you know who, though.
yes.
who?
him!
he's very gifted.
yeah, sure.
bring him over.
sir. thank you.
<i>thank you again, herr direktor.</i>
you're welcome again.
it's an honor to work
for such a great company.
it's great to have you.
i promise to learn everything there is
to know about enamelware production.
that's great.
hello? miss elsa krause is here.
i only need five minutes.
<i>she wants to speak
to the herr direktor.</i>
yes.
he won't see you.
please, sit down.
pernod? cognac?
no. no, thank you.
so, what can i do for you?
they say that no one dies here.
they say your
factory is a haven.
they say you are good.
who says that?
everyone.
my name is regina perlman,
not elsa krause.
i've been living in krakow on false
papers since the ghetto massacre.
my parents are in plaszow.
their names are
chana and jakob perlman.
they are older people. they are
killing older people now in plaszow.
they bury them up
in the forest. look,
i don't have any money.
i borrowed these clothes.
i'm begging you. please.
please bring them here.
i don't do that.
you've been misled.
i ask one thing.
whether or not the worker
has certain skills.
that's what i ask
and that's what i care about.
my father is an importer,
not a metalworker.
such activities are illegal. you will
not entrap me! (continues arguing)
cry, and i will have you arrested.
i swear to god!
(sobbing)
people die.
it's a fact of life.
he wants to kill everybody?
great!
what am i
supposed to do about it?
bring everybody over?
is that what you think?
send them over to schindler.
send them all!
his place is a haven, didn't you know?
it's not a factory.
it's not an enterprise
of any kind.
it's a haven for
rabbis and orphans
and people with no
skills whatsoever!
(sighs)
you think i don't
know what you're doing?
you're so quiet all the time.
i know, i know!
are you losing money?
that's not the point!
so the point is?
it's dangerous!
it's dangerous to me!
you have to understand. goeth
is under enormous pressure.
you have to think of
it in his situation.
he's got this
whole place to run.
he's responsible for everything
here, all these people.
he's got a lot of
things to worry about.
and he's got the war which
brings out the worst in people.
never the good, always the bad.
always the bad.
but in normal circumstances he wouldn't
be like this. he'd be all right.
there'd just be the good
aspects of him, which...
(chuckles)
he's a wonderful crook.
a man who loves good food, good
wine, the ladies, making money...
killing.
he can't enjoy it.
bejski told me the other day,
somebody escaped
from a work detail
outside the wire.
<i>goeth lined up everybody from
the missing man's barracks.</i>
<i>he shot the man to the left of
bejski, the man to the right of him.</i>
<i>he walked down the line shooting
every other man with a pistol.</i>
twenty-five.
what do you want
me to do about it?
nothing, nothing.
we're just talking.
"perlman."
perlman!
husband and wife.
jakob and chana perlman!
have goldberg bring them over.
<i>soldier: mützen ab!</i>
<i>appell abtreten!</i>
(guests singing drunkenly
in german)
i'm sure this will be better
than those rags, lisiek.
<i>herr direktor, i was just helping
lisiek to find something</i>
<i>to clean the stains from the
herr kommandant's bathtub.</i>
go clean it.
<i>pardon me, herr direktor.</i>
(schindler chuckles)
you don't have to
report to me, helen.
you know who i am? hmm?
(whispering) i'm schindler.
of course.
i have heard, and
you have been here before.
here, why don't you
keep this someplace?
go on, take it.
i get extra food here.
well, if you don't want to eat it, trade it.
or give it to lisiek.
why not build yourself up?
my first day here, he beat me
because i threw out
the bones from dinner.
he came down to the basement
at midnight, and he...
he asked me where they were.
for his dogs, you understand.
i said to him,
i don't know how i say this.
i never could say it now,
i said to him,
"why are you beating me?"
he said, "the reason
i beat you now
is because you
ask why i beat you."
i know your sufferings, helen.
it doesn't matter.
i have accepted them.
accepted them?
one day he will shoot me.
no, no, no, he won't shoot you.
i know. i see things.
we were on the roof on monday,
young lisiek and i,
<i>and we saw the herr kommandant
come out of the from door</i>
and down the steps by the
patio, right there below us,
and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he
shot a woman who
was passing by.
a woman carrying a bundle.
through the throat.
just a woman on her way
somewhere, you know?
she was no fatter or thinner
or slower or faster
than anyone else,
and i couldn't
guess what had she done.
<i>the more you see of
the herr kommandant,</i>
the more you see there is no set
rules that you can live by.
you can't say to yourself, "if i
follow these rules, i will be safe."
he won't shoot you because
he enjoys you too much.
he enjoys you so much he won't
even let you wear the star.
he doesn't want
anyone else to know
it's a jew he's enjoying.
he shot the woman
from the steps
because she meant
nothing to him.
she was one of a series,
neither offending
or pleasing him.
but you, helen.
it's all right. it's not
that kind of a kiss.
(sobbing)
thank you.
shh.
here.
right. the wine.
wonderful party, amon.
thank you.
(groans)
why do you drink
that motor oil?
hmm? i send you good
stuff all the time.
your liver's going to explode
like a hand grenade.
you know, i look at you.
(sniffs)
i watch you.
(sighs)
you're never drunk.
(sniffs) oh, that's...
that's real control.
control is power.
that's power.
schindler:
is that why they fear us?
we have the fucking power to
kill, that's why they fear us.
they fear us because we have
the power to kill arbitrarily.
a man commits a crime,
he should know better.
we have him killed, and we
feel pretty good about it.
or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.
that's not power, though.
that's justice.
it's different than power.
power is when we have
everyjustification to kill,
and we don't.
you think that's power?
that's what the emperors had.
a man stole something,
he's brought in
before the emperor,
he throws himself down on the
ground, he begs for mercy.
he knows he's going to die.
and the emperor pardons him.
this worthless man.
he lets him go.
i think you are drunk.
that's power, amon.
that is power.
amon the good.
i pardon you. (laughs)
<i>goeth: what do they want?</i>
<i>stern: i don't know, but they're in

you needn't be alarmed.
i needn't be alarmed.

that you really
are a wonderful cook
and a well-trained servant.

i'd be happy to give you one.
it must get lonely down here
when you're listening to everyone
upstairs having such a good time.
does it?
you can answer.
but what's the right answer?
that's what you're thinking.
what does he want to hear?
the truth, helen,
is always the right answer.
yes, you're right.
sometimes we're both lonely.
yes. i...
(sighs)
i mean,
i would like so much to
reach out and touch
you in your loneliness.
what would that be like,
i wonder? i mean...
what would be wrong with that?

no, you make a good point.
you make a very good point.

the trains arrived and the people
were driven out with clubs.
they were lined up in front
of two big warehouses.
one was marked "cloak room,"
and the other "valuables."
and there they
were made to undress.
a jewish boy handed them pieces of
string to tie their shoes together.
they shaved their hair.
they told them it was needed to
make something
special for u-boat crews.
and then they were herded
down a big corridor
to bunkers with stars
of david on the doors
and signs that said
"bath and inhalation room."
ss gave them soap.
they told them to
breathe all the time
because it's good
for disinfecting.
and then they gassed them.
mila, why soaps?
so that they would
agree to go in, i think.
come on, mila, stop it. your bedtime
stories are scaring everyone.
yeah. you know
it's ridiculous.
i cannot believe it.
i didn't say i believed it.
i said i heard it.
from who?
from somebody who heard it
from someone who was there.
you know, if they were there,
they would have been gassed.
yes.
it doesn't make any sense.
we're their workforce.
what sense does it make
to kill your own workforce?
to go to all this trouble of
assembling a workforce only to...
no, it can't be true.

very important for them.

you should be aware of that.
we will have to risk regret.
all right, sure. it's a nice day.
i'll go for a drive with you.
what about you?
i violated the race
and resettlement act.
though i doubt anyone can point
out the actual provision to me.
i kissed a jewish girl.
(chuckling)
did your prick fall off?
(both laughing)
(continues laughing)
goeth: he likes women.
he likes good-looking women.
he sees a beautiful woman,
he doesn't think.

i mean...
he has so many women.
and they love him.
<i>ja, they love him. i mean, he
is married, ja, but he's...</i>
all right, no. she was jewish.
he shouldn't have done it.
but you didn't see this girl.
i saw this girl.
this girl was, woof...
she was very good-looking.
they cast a spell on you,
you know, the jews.
when you work closely with
them, like i do, you see this.
they have this power.
it's like a virus.
some of my men are
infected with this virus.
they should be pitied, not punished.
they should receive treatment.
this is as real as typhus.
i see this all the time.
it's a matter of money? hmm?
you're offering me a bribe?
a bribe? no.
no, please. it's a gratuity.
<i>heil hitler!</i>
hello, amon.
sit down.
we give you jewish girls
at five marks a day, oskar.
you should kiss us, not them.
god forbid you ever get
a real taste for jewish skirt.
there's no future in it.
they don't have a future.
that's not just good,
old-fashioned, jew-hating talk.

do, they come up with this?
i have to find every rag
buried up here and burn it.
the party's over, oskar.
they're closing
us down, sending
everybody to auschwitz.
when?
i don't know. as soon as
i can arrange the shipments.
maybe 30, 40 days.
that ought to be fun.
schindler:
i've been talking to goeth.
i know the destination.
these are
the evacuation orders.
i'm to help organize the shipments,
put myself on the last train.
that's not what i
was going to say.
i made goeth promise me he'll
put in a good word for you.
nothing bad is going
to happen to you there.
you'll receive
special treatment.
the directives
coming in from berlin
mention "special treatment"
more and more often.
i'd like to think
that's not what you mean.
preferential treatment,
all right?
do we have to invent
a whole new language?
i think so.
you're staying, i take it.
in krakow? what on earth for?
what for? you have
a business to run.
of course, you'll have to hire new workers.
poles, i guess.
they cost a little more, but...
what are you going to do?
you ran my business.
no, i'm going home.
i've done what i came here for.
i've got more money than any
man can spend in a lifetime.
some day, this is all
going to end, you know.
i was going to say
we'll have a drink then.
i think i better have it now.

man: how old are you, mother?
woman: sixty-eight.
cough for me, mother.
they say to fall against
the fence is a kindness.
don't kill yourself
against the fence, clara.
if you do, you'll never know
what happened to you.
how old are you, mother?
sixty-six, sir.
sir?
good morning.
a mistake has been made. we
are not supposed to be here.
we work for oskar schindler.
we are schindler jews.
who is oskar schindler?
he had a factory in krakow.
enamelware.
a pot maker.
how old are you, mother?
you are not the only
industrialist who needs labor,
<i>herr schindler.</i>
i remember earlier this year,
ig farben ordered
a trainload of hungarians
for its chemical factory.
the train came in
through the archway
and the officer in charge of the
selection went immediately to work
and sent 2,000 of them
straight away to
special treatment.
it is not my task
to interfere with
the processes that
take place down here.
why do you think i can help you
if i can't help ig farben?
allow me to express the reason.
i'm not making any
judgment about you.
it's just that i know
that in the coming months,
we're all going to
need portable wealth.
i could have you arrested.
i'm protected by powerful friends.
you should know that.
i do not say i
am accepting them.
all i say is, i'm not comfortable
with them on the table.
i have a shipment
coming in tomorrow.
i'll cut you 300 units from it.
new ones.
these are fresh.
the train comes,
we turn it around.
mmm, yes, yes.
it's yours.
i understand.
i want these.
you shouldn't
get stuck on names.
that's right. it creates
a lot of paperwork.

you tell me.

(train whistle blowing)
under department "w" provisions
it is unlawful to kill a
worker without just cause.
under the businesses
compensation fund
lam entitled to file
damage claims for such deaths.
if you shoot without thinking,
you go to prison, i get paid.
that's how it works.
so, there will be
no summary executions here.
there will be no interference
of any kind with production.
in hopes of ensuring
that, guards will
no longer be allowed
on the factory floor
without my authorization.
for your cooperation,
you have my gratitude.
come on, come.

this is itzhak stern,
my accountant. itzhak...
you must be
mrs. schindler.
it's a pleasure to meet you.
emilie has volunteered
to work in the clinic.
very generous of you.
i know.
we need to talk
when you have a moment.
this is my wife, stern. i don't
keep any secrets from my spouse.
oskar, please, attend to business.
it's much more attractive.
madam.
hello.
what is it? we've received
an angry complaint
from the armaments board.
the artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings,
apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests.
that's to be expected.
start-up problems.
this isn't pots and pans.
this is a precise business.
i'll write them a letter.
they're withholding payment.
sure, so would i, so would you.
i wouldn't worry about it. we'll
get it right one of these days.
there's a rumor you've been going
around miscalibrating the machines.
they could shut us down,
send us back to auschwitz.
i'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.
pass them off as ours.
i don't see the difference.
whether they're made here
or somewhere else...
you don't see a difference?
i see a difference.
you'll lose a lot of money.
fewer shells will be made.
stern, if this factory
ever produces
a shell that can
actually be fired,
i'll be very unhappy-
woman: hello, madam.
how do you do?
(machine grinding)
how are you doing, rabbi?
rabbi!
<i>good, herr direktor.</i>
sun's going down.
yes, it is.
what day is this? friday?
it is friday, isn't it?
is it?
what's the matter with you? you
should be preparing for the sabbath.
shouldn't you?
i've got some wine.
in my office. come.

<i>winston churchill on radio:
yesterday morning, at 2:41 a.m.,</i>
<i>at general eisenhower's
headquarters,</i>
<i>general jodl signed the act
of unconditional surrender</i>
<i>of all german land,
sea and air forces in europe</i>
<i>to the allied
expeditionary force</i>
<i>and simultaneously
to the soviet high command.</i>
<i>the german war is,
therefore, at an end.</i>
(footsteps approaching)
<i>(knocking at door) but let us
not forget for a moment...</i>
i think it's time the guards
came into the factory.
<i>japan,
with all her treachery...</i>
the unconditional surrender of
germany has just been announced.
at midnight tonight,
the war is over.
tomorrow you'll
begin the process
of looking for survivors
of your families.
in most cases,
you won't find them.
after six long years of murder,
victims are being mourned
throughout the world.
we've survived.
many of you have come up to me
and thanked me.
thank yourselves.
thank your fearless stern
and others among you
who worried about you
and faced death
at every moment.
i'm a member of the nazi party.
i'm a munitions manufacturer.
i'm a profiteer of slave labor.
i am a criminal.
at midnight you'll be free,
and i'll be hunted.
i shall remain with you until
five minutes after midnight,
after which time,
and i hope you'll forgive me,
i have to flee.
i know you have received
orders from our commandant,
which he has received
from his superiors,
to dispose of the population
of this camp.
now would be the time to do it.
here they are, they're all here.
this is your opportunity.
(people murmuring)
or you could leave
and return to
your families as men
instead of murderers.
in memory of the countless
victims among your people,
i ask us to observe
three minutes of silence.

as soon as peace occurs,
i want...
i want that cloth
distributed to the workers.
two and a half meters each.
also, each person is to
get a bottle of vodka.
they won't drink it.
they know its value.
likewise those egipshi
cigarettes we organized.
it'll be done.
everything you ask.
we've written a letter,

every worker has signed it.

i could have got more out.
i could have got more.
i don't know.

i could have got more.
oskar, there are 1,100 people who are
alive because of you. look at them.
if i'd made more money.
(laughs)
i threw away so much money.
(sobbing) you have no idea.
if i had just...
there will be generations
because of what you did.
i didn't do enough.
you did so much.
this car.
goeth would've bought this car.
why did i keep the car?
ten people right there.
ten people.
ten more people.
this pin...
two people.
this is gold.
two more people.
he would have given me
two for it, at least one.
he would have
given me one, one more.
one more person.
a person, stern.
for this.
(sobbing) i could have gotten
one more person, and i didn't.
and i didn't!
(loud sobbing)
you have been liberated
by the soviet army!
have you been in poland?
i just came from poland.
are there any jews left?
where should we go?
russian officer: don't go
east, that's for sure.
they hate you there.
i wouldn't go west either,
if i were you.
we could use some food.
isn't there a town over there?
