he's also irish, which again, weirdly,
a plus point, if you like swearing.
"feckin' dis" and "feckin' dat".
some irish people say “feck off"

so here's the situation.
pat is refusing to speak to us directly.
he's willing to give us three hostages but
only if he can talk to us through you.
now, we need to know why pat has done this so
we can draw things to a peaceful conclusion.
yeah, sure, i'll talk to him. deal.

so what do you say, al?
will you help us?
yep.
guys, none of us choose
the hand we're dealt..
- you know..
- we do need an answer, i'm afraid.
do you have another siege to go to?
it's my understanding that if you say
yes, you're allowed a few words.
- so you are saying yes?
- i was leaving that to the end.
- if you'd like to come with me.
- sure.

if i had my way, all police
officers would carry firearms.
i think that firearms should remain
in the hands of specialists.
i was going to say that only specialists
should be allowed to fire them.

you can call my assistant.
alan!! read my lips.

right, well, dom will fill you in.
he has to say all that
shit for the insurance.
- right.
- tell me this much, mate.
- what's your favourite siege?
- iranian embassy.
same. why?
they used the sound of a pneumatic drill
to disguise the noise of them removing
bricks from a neighbouring wall.
- so they could smash through and..
- take them out the game.
it's just a great siege.
right.
do you want to see my gun?
does erm.. yes, please.
let's clock the glock.
you'll have to move quicker than that.
- any last messages for your kids?
- oh.. er..
no, they don't speak to me any more.
yeah, "why don't you
speak to me any more?"
i wouldn't know the answer, would i?
<b>so just um.. just..

i bought you some cake,
not that you deserve it after that.

oh, i already have.
- how the devil are you?
- yeah, not bad, not bad.
how are you feeling?
- great!!
- good.
oh, er.. the police told
me to bring you this.
it's just a standard field phone,
should you feel the inclination
to communicate with ze authorities.
good thing about these things, they're
immune to the problems and glitches
you get with satellite phones.
but, like i say, it's
just an option, really.
i just realised, when you asked me
now how i was feeling, you meant..
yes, i did.
- does this answer your question?
- yes, it does.
oh, hello.
didn't see you there.
someone's been in the wars.
- that's just simon.
- can he breathe through that?
of course. it's just
like wearing a mask.
at least when someone puts you in
a mask, you've got a safe word,
like "airbag", or "crayfish".
what's the er..
that thing?
oh, we made that. it's a head holster.
- never heard of one of those.
- yeah, i'll show you. simon?
you insert the shotgun.
place on stand.
and.. voilá.
hands free. i can move around

i don't even have to look.
boom. hit the target.

you don't need an accomplice.
well, i've got you now.
yeah.
thank you.
so you're with the police now?
<b>oh, this.. no, this is just..</b>
i think it's velcro.
there you go.
feck the police.
i think they thought that
if they did take a pot shot at you -
it's a siege, you've got a gun -
that the bullet might pass through you
and hit me.
unless they use dum-dums,
which explode inside the body.
i said, do not use dum-dums on
pat ferrell, farrell, ferrell.
just use a high-velocity round
that passes through his body
because he's a friend of mine.
and i suppose if i want to shoot you,
i can always aim for the head.
exactly. exactly.
um.. i don't even
know why i'm wearing it.
- so take it off.
- i'll happily take it off.
go on, then.
- if you want me to, i'll take it off.
- fucking take it off!!
oh, pat, now you're making
me want to wear it.
this is not my bag.

oh, my god!!
that's like some son of zoo
from planet of the apes.
danny looks a bit.. bruised.
i lost my temper a couple of times.
- three times.
- yeah. yeah, yeah, it was three.
go and say hello.
- give him a slap yourself, if you want.
- oh, no..
no, i'll just..
i'll just say hello.
- alan..
- look, do the police know we're here?
alan!! what the hell's going on?
hey!! hey, hey, hey!!
cool it with the cross-talk,
you're professional broadcasters.
- i'm not, i'm a writer.
- we'll get through this with each other.
i want everyone to shake hands with everyone else.
now!! whether you want to or not.
this is ridiculous.
ow.
hello, er.. connor.
- paper.
- hi.
ok. pat will not communicate
directly with the police.
only through me.
so as of now, i am bullhorn.
- but i think we're gonna be ok.
- ok? he hit me!!
let's not get into who hit who or,
you know, who may have deserved it.
you need to keep him away from me.
understand?
what i need to do, danny,
in conjunction with jason,
is crisis management.
i'm sure he'll agree
there has been plenty of crisis..
<b>- but no management.
- cowabunga. walk with me.</b>
alan, you do realise
you're in the box seat here?
you've got the guy's confidence.
yeah. i don't know why.
i go for a curry with him once a year,
and even then i don't have a starter.
trouble is, he does.
all i need to know is can
you handle it?
well, er..
would you ask that of a man
who'd gone paint-balling,
realised he'd left his goggles at
reception but carried on anyway?
- why?
- you're looking at him.
ok, guys,
quick wa-wa.
just had a pow-wow with jase,
upshot is..
i'm gonna be his right-hand
man on this one.
he'll be um.. my left-hand man.
<b>- er..
- sorry.</b>
the point is,
pat has not gone mad.
he has a grievance.
he needs some son of outlet.
this is pat farrell, welcoming you to roll
out the farrell on north norfolk digital.
ok. pat may have..
may have gone mad.
he may have gone mad.
<b>and now we have a text from
cynthia in holt, who writes,</b>
<b>dear pat, we are sending you a bottle..</b>
<b>- ma'am, you'd better listen to this.
- ..of our homemade plum brandy.</b>
<b>we use it to make brandy butter..</b>
- why am i listening to shit radio?
- that's pat farrell, ma'am.
he's broadcasting from the siege.
<b>mm, yum, cynthia.
can't wait.</b>
can you gently remind pat
that we had an agreement?
you are there to communicate with us.
listen, i don't know what it says
in your police operation manual..
- ..or in psycho-babble weekly.
- penguin book of sieges.
or the penguin book of sieges,
but out here in the field,
it's plenty different.
i've got a guy with a gun and a gripe
to grind, and he say, "no speaky."
i would really like to establish
a dialogue here, alan.
a simple tri-lateral exchange,
from pat, to you, to me, to you, to pat.
- do you understand?
- no more interruptions or else!!
you think i don't have balls?
i've got plenty of balls!!
i've got balls coming
out of my arse!!
- er.. did you hear that?
- yes.
<b>well, that's.. that's the
end of the call. bye.</b>

- jason wanted them deleted.
- he won't have deleted them all.
- he did delete them all.
- he did delete them all, pat.
- what?
- it was jingle genocide.
- that's not helping, simon.
the bastard. alan, take over for me.
<b>- no.
- i'm gonna straighten him out.</b>
oh, and.. keep it light.
right, um.. ok.
you're listening to the
pat and alan show.
- mainly pat.
- you, jason. yeah, you.
we'll be asking.. w-what time..
does mike paper slider
switch to.. to..
to mouse his chocolate cups?
- it doesn't make sense.
- it doesn't make sense
but if you can rearrange to make sense
then you could win.. bins..

- alan, help me!!
- so that's our win a bin and window,
re-arrange the sentence,

oh, shit.
this is the theme from ski sunday.
sorry for swearing.
♪ theme tune
i've put up with shits like
you for most of my life..
one hour.
and if that jingle isn't word for word
what i just said,
i am going to shoot you in the feet,
then the knees, then the hands.
and basically anything you've
got two of, like your face.
oh, yeah. two-faced.
one hour.
one hour? this is impossible.
i'm gonna fucking die.
what are we gonna do?
you can't do a top-quality
jingle in an hour.
we can do this. let me
tell you a story, um..
back in the day, i was mc-ing a
conference for reynard pharmaceuticals.
some of the marketing guys
were doing karaoke.
i didn't join in,
i tended to shun japanese culture.
this was the mid-90s,
it was more acceptable.
but high on a cocktail of champagne
and cheap fosters lager,
i lunged at the microphone.
a few minutes later,
i was making grown men cry
with my rendition of summer of '69
by bryan adams.
thing is, i twisted the
lyrics to the summer of '29,
evoking memories of the wall street
crash and german hyperinﬂation.
- remember, these guys were in sales.
- alan, where are you going with this?
the point is, he didn't think
he was any good at singing,
and it turns out he was quite good.
- yeah, that.
- and that if you really, really try
- you can do anything.
- and that.
i don't care!! i'm going to fucking die!!
hey, hey, i'm trying to save your head,
shoulders, knees and toes.
- knees and toes.
- ok, man up, musos.
- i played synth in a jazz funk band.
- great, who else?
i used to be the drummer
in marillion.
really? there's no time for that.
<b>- but wow and great.
- what are you gonna do first?</b>
i'm gonna lay down a rhythm track.
oh.
lynn benfield?
<b>- i am she.
- do you know mr alan partridge?</b>
ok.
he wasn't stealing crisps.
he just gets ﬂustered at
self-service checkouts
- and takes things without scanning them.
- miss benfield..
he doesn't like being told to put things
in bagging areas by automated women.
no, miss benfield, we're here
because mr partridge is
currently involved in an armed siege.
- oh.
- we're informing you as his next of kin.
take me to him.

we're speaking to anyone who can
help us build a picture of pat farrell.
- you said you know him?
- ah, well..
i made three cakes for
him over the last year.
but there was nothing in them
that would have led him to do this.
- they were very plain.
- that's not one of our lines of investigation.
just tell us what you know about pat.
irish. shock of brown, curly hair.
he's a strong man, with strong arms
and a good walk. moves well.
- that's very helpful, lynn.
- oh.
- thank you.
- now, how about some coffee?
oh, of course. how do you take it?
no, no, we'll get it for you.
just sit there, i'll be back.

i hate all this shit.
telling us how to speak.
they think they're giving us
an identity but they're..
turning us into nobodies.
we're just unit-shifters
for the money men.
sounds quite good.
alan, did you ever imagine
what life would be like in your 50s?
i had hopes and dreams.
i think we all did.
penny for them.
keep the penny,
you've got a gun.
but, yeah, i used to dream that one day
i'd drive a brand-new range rover
towing a speed boat.
i used to dream about growing old
with someone i love.
hm. both valid.
it's not gonna happen now, is it?
i miss my molly so much.
- who's this chap?
- that's molly.
yes, of course.
she's got such.. brown hair.
a year after that was
taken, the angels took her.
must have been a few of them.
now i've nobody.
no wife.
no family. no kids.
i've gotta say, pat, kids
don't make you happy.
some of the unhappiest times of my life
have been with my kids.
i remember..
a holiday on the
beach in prestatyn.
the kids came over to me and said,
"papa, papa!! follow me,"
and.. you know..
i followed them about 200 yards
across the sand dunes.
when i got there, finally,
all they'd done was dug a big hole.
miserable.
sounds lovely.

aw.

that's not in the system.
we are only allowed
play-approved tracks.
<b>but, pat, you've got a gun.
you can play whatever you like.</b>
leave it with me
and i'll see what i can do, ok?
remember we used to choose
our own records?
yeah. or put on a compilation album if
you were tired or couldn't be bothered.
yeah.
you like country music, alan?
can't say i do, pat.
it's just jilted spouses
complaining whilst drunk.
also known as a date, if you're over 40.
when a listener asks for a song
and i don't have it,
i feel like i've let them down.
and willie nelson
was molly's favourite too.
and always on my mind
was her favourite song.
do you remember that?
the old road show bus.
remember it? i took my
family camping in that.
- yeah?
- that was a tough nine days.
you see, this bus brought
joy to hundreds.
i wonder where it is now.
probably impounded

no, no, it's in the basement.

i've got pat on the end of
the line in both senses.
i'm tethered to the building via
this rope and relaying messages
from pat via this state-of-the-art
sennheiser 1,000 head set.
nice bit of kit. yeah, i'm
telling them that now.

know i'm telling them.
- pat says “hi".

this can all end well. ok?
<b>- i give him my word.
- ok, just.. yep.</b>
ok. pat, you've got to..
you're rambling.
you've got to be more concise.
what do you want? “i want a helicopter."
that's just an example, by the way.
yeah, ok. he wants a helicopter.
<b>that might not
be possible, alan.</b>
<b>but let's dialogue.
what else can we do for him?</b>
pat says, "fucking stupid pigs.
what the hell's going on?"
pat, listen to me. that
was not an attack, ok?
we just had to dispose of a box around
the corner in a controlled manner.
pat would prefer it if you
spoke through me, as would i.
marlin says they deployed
a remote rv fitted with a disruptor
to neutralise a suspected ied. he doesn't know
what you're talking about. he's quite angry.
he's honking in my ear
like a mad irish goose.
- aha!!
- we love you, alan!!
um.. do you mind? it's
not a radio road show.
<b>- i'm trying to host a siege here.
- we love you, alan!!</b>
get away. who said that?
what's it like in there?
ah.. scary, stressful, lots of shouting.
a bit like being married again.
and there's a crazy person
running around with a gun.
so it's a lot like being married again.
and er.. when i saw a guy with a shotgun
in his mouth begging for mercy then..
you're ahead of me.
you're ahead of me. a lot of you are.
he's still got his hand on his gun.
he thinks i don't know. yeah, you.

- get your hands above your head!!</b>
- i want to get those trousers.
- do it!! hands above your head.
- they're my trousers.
- get your hands above your head now!!
what are you doing? it's weird.
there are paparazzi all over the place
and i do not want them
to get a photograph of my genitals.
- oh, come on!!
- that's it, look at me.
and how were the hostages when you left?
- crouched.
- i mean, what's their state of mind?
oh. er.. if i'm honest, a bit moany.
yeah. is someone writing this down?
<b>- yeah.
- sorry. i thought you were some clothes.</b>
thanks for the forensic
trousers, by the way.
- could you just um..?
- crikey. yeah, sorry.
i was actually going to fashion a
sort of make-shift modesty sporran
from the vacant arm flaps.
ok, i think we're done here.
any chance of freshening up? i just need
to wipe my face with a big hot towel.
presumably you wanna use me
as part of your media strat?
no.
- do you agree?
- 100 per cent.
gotcha.
the police said you could do media
interviews when the siege is over.
it will be too late then, lynn. people
move on. goredale media will move on.
but you're still being talked about.
only cos every time i look at the telly,
they're showing a picture of my arse.
it's all right for you. every other time i
look, they show a picture of your face.
and then the next time -
surprise, surprise, my arse again.
i was only telling people about you.
you know, i was goredale's golden goose,
and now i'm just partridge pie, with peas.
but why do you want to work
for people like that?
- goredale are bullies.
- yeah. and what do you do with a bully?
you make friends with the bully
so they bully someone else.
- "what doth it profit a man.."
- doth?
"..if he gains the whole world yet loses
his soul?" matthew, chapter eight..
yeah, i know who wrote it.
i'm not going to sell my soul, lynn.
i want to, if you like,
lend my soul to goredale media
on a long-term basis for cash.
it's a very different thing.
i don't know how
you can look yourself in the eye.
i can't, lynn. my nose is in the way.
you can talk,
prattling away on every news bulletin.
i mean, who the heck
do you think you are?
- i'm lynn benfield.
- you don't look like lynn benfield.
i mean, what has happened to you,
with your attitude and your hair?
you've literally become a big head.
- i like it.
- i take no pleasure in saying this, lynn,
but a lot of people think it looks
like a photograph of an explosion.
i don't know if i want to
work for a man like you.
i don't know that i want to employ
someone who looks like a madam.
and i don't mean a parisian one -
i mean, one who lives in a terraced
house behind a train station.
- doors opening!!
- armed police!! armed police!!
oh, shut up, will you?
stop shouting.
- easy, pat. mind the steps.
- i'm able to walk down steps, all right?
he means because the gun's
against my head.
- everybody has an opinion, huh?
- hear, hear. well said.
- on.
- hi, pat.
hey, alan. what happened?
we were in the middle of a show,
and then your arse is all
over the internet.
looked like you had a turkey's head
between your legs.
no, it didn't. no, it didn't.
it doesn't have a beak.
and, yeah, i took an executive decision
to stow my cock and balls up
against my backside.
i can't believe you left
me with this nutcase.
hang on a minute, you're
the one with the gun.
- see? he's hilarious.
- he's solid. he's solid.
- pizzas coming through now, pat.
- hey. hey, hey. hold on. helmet off.
oh, hello.
actually, i want alan to bring them in.
that might not be possible, pat.
alan's not prepared to do that.
no.. i am prepared to do that.
<b>- it's not that simple.
- do you want me to release some people?</b>
sure. let's talk about that.
alan, what do you reckon
if i let the women go?
yeah, let a couple of the women go.
maybe keep angela.
<b>- but her kids will be worried sick.
- she's got kids?</b>
yeah. two boys, 14 and 15.
i believe they're a real handful.
yeah, what was i thinking?
let all the women go.
pat, give me five minutes
with head office.
he's bringing them in now.
alan, come on.
- top one.
- top one.
- yeah, yeah, cheers, guys. top one.
- ok, come on, son.
oh, shit.
why did you say hello
to that delivery guy?
oh, him? no, he just reminded me
of a man i know called mike cable,
who did my accounts from '97 to '98.
actually, no. '99.
till he stopped
because his daughter was very ill.
yeah, it was touch and go, actually.
he and sandra were in bits,
they had to cancel their holiday.
- it was a ﬂy-drive to tuscany.
- hm.
i must tell him, actually, that there's
a policeman that looks just like him.
what's that?
must tell mike that there's a pizza man
who looks just like him.
i'm famished.
- ladies, you're free to go.
- what?
- yep.
- god bless you, pat.
see you. bye.
i'll make you a home-made pizza
when you get out.
yeah, these pizzas are pretty good.
- cinderella.
- yeah, well..
no, hers was.. that was
a glass one, wasn't it?
here comes the tin man.
- just trying to find your pizza.
- well, just give me that one.
- hm?
- that one.
- which one?
- the top one.
oh..
- i'll take the pizzas.
- oh, yeah. yeah.
woo-ho, stuffed crust!!
- thanks for coming back, alan.
- what are you doing?
- i'm just seeing how you'll look
on the billboard for when you start
on the breakfast show.
- the breakfast show?
- alan, can i have a word?
yeah, sure.
just bringing the pizza cutter.
right, how many do you want.
six or eight?
oh, my god, that's a taser!!
this is no use, it's a pizza cutter.
and that is not a pizza.
thing is, how did it get there?
erm..
unless the pizza company are running
a competition in which you win a taser.
that doesn't make sense, does it?
do you realise, it's the police?
<b>the ruddy po.. do you know.. they've got
some brass neck for a bunch of coppers.</b>

you should keep that as an extra weapon.

- no, i'm talking to him.
- oh, for fuck's sake.
<b>- yeah, go ahead.
- thank you.</b>
are you all right?
well, i was worried about the old head
but i think i've got a handle on it.
- very witty.
- alan's a smart cookie, pat.
he's treated this whole crisis
like a business opportunity.
he's taken a look around him and he's
thought, "how can i make this work for me?"
- well done, alan.
