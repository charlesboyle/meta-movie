you left everything you had
out there on that court.
so that when the final buzzer
went off--
[imitates buzzer]
--you were champions.
now, i want you
to promise me something.
i want you to play life just like
you played that game today.
so when that final buzzer of life
goes off--

hey.
greggie, keithie.
[people screaming
on video game]
you guys ever hear of a game
called chutes and ladders?
pretty awesome game.
i used to play it when i was a kid.
okay, what it is,
is they give you a spinner.
and you spin. if you land on a ladder,
you get to climb up the ladder.
if you land on a chute, you slide
down the chute and start over again.
yeah, and what happens?
the winner gets a training bra?
yeah, dad, that game
sounds like it sucks.
i'm telling you,
this was the greatest game.
me and my buddies would play it.
we'd go down in the basement,
drink hot chocolate.
i wouldn't mind
a hot chocolate right now.
hey, rita.
rita.
dude, you gotta text her.
she's doing laundry.
[phone ringing]
hey, dad, we were at
the spielbergs' house yesterday.
they have a 1 50-inch tv.
can we get one of those?
<i>when you direct e. t.
i'll get you one of those.</i>
<i>man 1 :

what is the object here?
i don't get it.
you're on a cruise ship and you chop
people's heads off with a chain saw?
oh, and you can
drown them.
oh, you can drown them.
now i get it.
[woman screams
on video game]
can somebody answer
the phone?
maybe i should get some
chamomile for my throat too.
stop texting the nanny.
you know how gross that is
for a kid to text his nanny?
just go down the hallway.
why? you text everybody.
i text people for my job so i can
make money to pay for your texting.
okay, i got everything
for you, boys.
who was that on the phone, rita?
i'm sorry, mr. feder, i don't know.

oh, my god.
becky:
i didn't mean to. lt was an accident.
i don't care. are you all right?
what the heck were you doing?
i was trying to use the navy.

the navy in the car
to ask it a question.

the navigation system, idiot.
shh. keithie, relax.
some man called.
he said your friend,
coach buzzer, went to heaven.
i was trying to find heaven for you
on the navy station
so you could go visit him.
[sighs]
yikes.

pfft! my daughter's gotta bust
her hump all day to pay the bills
while dummy here stays home

when you look like idi amin
with a propeller on your head.
that's nice that he could--
roxanne, this is my mother.
hello, mama ronzoni, i'm so pleased
to meet you. i'm little lenny's wife.
ooh. what a spicy quesadilla

my wife brought her into the house.
oh, your wife's into chicks.

on me, man. are you a b-cup now?
[both laughing]

that's true.
he's got wilt, pistol pete, dr. j.
yeah, dr. j's alive still.
well, those type of guys.
yeah, yeah.
you look good, though, man.
it's like if elvis
was an oompa loompa,
he's right in front of me.
well, i don't make jokes at funerals
because it's disrespectful.
but if that's part of your
healing process, i'm cool with it.
ah, that's nice. thanks.
are you cool with
a finger in you? woo-hoo!
[rob chuckles]
hey, uh, roxanne.

[all chuckling]
he's not kidding.
oh, grody.
oh, those are long,
long tongues.
we'll see you in there.
see you in there.
hi, guys.
right over there? yep.
sit right here, sit right here.
i'm gonna go say hi to lenny.
no, honey.
oh, hi. lenny.
how you doing?
oh, oh, oh.
i heard through a little bird
that you guys rented
the earnshaw lake house for us
for the entire weekend.
that's like a dream
come true for us.
we had to rent it
for the whole weekend be--
we don't get to stay the whole weekend.
we have to go to milan.
for roxanne's
fashion show.
oh. oh, my god, that's a shame.
oh, but you're gonna have
so much fun in milan.
you know, j lo and marc anthony
vacationed there last year.
it's up the street from lake como,
where george clooney has a villa.
i read too many of those magazines.
no.
come on. i'm sorry.
he hates when i talk about this.
we'll just--
we are backing away.
ashamed, right?
oh, and tom cruise
got married there too.
thanks for letting me know.
what?
well, i don't understand why you had
to rent it for a whole weekend.
because it's a holiday. they won't
rent it to you for one night.
so your friends are partying all
weekend while you're stuck in milan.
yeah.
that was nice of you.
lt was nice of us.
it's your money too, isn't it?
yeah, it's your money,
it's his money, it's my money.
let's put all our cash
in a pile and split it. heh, heh.
that's a nice hat, it brings out
the death in the room.
i'm sorry, i'm nervous.
and it's a funeral, i get weird.
there he is, joe hollywood.
robideaux:
mr. big shot agent.
you think he represents
hulk hogan?
no way.
then he ain't that big, is he?
by the way, if anyone asks,
rita is an exchange student.
andre. heh.
i think i just sat
on your adding machine.
now i know what happened
to the fish tank.
pastor: coach robert
''the buzzer'' ferdinando
was a caretaker by profession.
what a wonderful word to describe
his devotion to his fellow man.
he truly took care.
when robert knew
that his time was short,
he told me there was
one specific man he wanted
to say a few words
to memorialize him.
so i'd like to ask lenny feder
to come up now.
i'm sorry, i'm not prepared at all.
i feel very honored
that coach asked me
to do this, but, uh--
i also feel terrible because
i haven't seen the coach in so long.
and he always wanted me to come
to town and see him
and i got caught up in what i've
been doing and i regret it.
i understand that the
st. mark's team of 1 9 7 8
was the only championship team
that the coach ever had, and, uh,
that's very impressive,
i gotta say,
judging from the talent
we had to offer.
i mean, believe it or not,
robbie and marcus were actually
shorter back in 1 9 7 8.
but those guys had a skill
you never mastered.
they knew how to pass the ball.
looks like somebody has to learn how
to pass the kentucky fried chicken.
i'm kidding, i'm kidding.
we're saying goodbye to
a big part of our lives. all of us.
you affected everybody
in this room.
and, um, i hope we get
to live our lives like you.
have no regrets
when life's final buzzer sounds.
so, uh, let's all bow
our heads in silence.
[rob singing ''ave marla'']
they should have
just ended it right after you.
this is insanity.
yeah.
five bucks it takes him down
on one knee.
you're on.
okay.
[chuckles]
<i>[mouths]
stop it.</i>
[eric & lenny chuckling]
[laughing]
[imitates buzzer]
[crowd laughing]
grow up, will you?
oh, look at him now.
don't get so mad there, robbie.
[band playing jazz music]
lenny:
so how we feeling about rob's girl?
we're happy for him, or--?
oh, my god. the st. pauli grandma?
she seems all right.
eric:
she's pretty.
you know, in a ''me in
a wig'' sort of way.
yeah. yeah, exactly.
when ben franklin was flying that
kite and it had the key on it,
that was to her apartment.
oh, that
was good, man.
eric: you know, but i gotta say,
he seems like he's in love, you know?
he was in love
with the first three wives.
the cheater, the beater
and the eater.
you know, his problem is he's always
so overly in love so quick, you know?
and then one day he snaps
and then it gets ugly in a hurry.
coffee, mr. feder?
no, no, no.
i'm good, i'm good.
i mean, thank you. that's cool of you
to voluntarily wanna give me coffee.
just, you drink it, you know, while
you're studying inside the church.
but you texted me
you want coffee.
i texted you that i wanted you
to drink the coffee and study.
so study your books
in the church.
go ahead.
all right, rita.
fast food?
you guys eat the fast--?
mommy, i want some milk.
oh, sure, angel. you come here.
i'll give you a little something.
slow down, honey.
not such big gulps.
you're gonna get a tummy ache.
your son is so cute.
eric: yeah.
how old is he?
oh, he's, uh, 48 months.
that's 4.
yeah.
we meant to stop last year,
but he likes it so much
and we don't like to say no.
hey, sweetheart?
could you use a fork,
please?
no.
no, no, no!
looks like she
didn't get the memo.
[laughs]
[aerosmith's ''last child''
playing]
kurt: hey. let me get that spot.
eric: hey, gotta respect the caddy.
it's nice you drove
your piggy bank here.
hey.
hey.
hey. hi, gloria.
wow.
sally: look at this.
come on.
lenny:
yeah.
marcus: hey, rob's car
is an oompa loompa too.
eric: okay, watch the edge.
it's cute. it'll do for one night.
yeah? you can handle it?
[electricity crackling]
daddy, what is that machine doing?
it's getting rid of the moths, honey.
where's it taking them?
hell.
lenny: don't say that, higgins.
i'm sorry. not hell, mexico.
no, it's giving them
electricity
so the moths fall asleep
electrically.
it's electrocuting them?
no, no, no.
but, daddy, they're dying.
both: it's killing them?
no.
daddy, no.
no, no, it's not.
okay? let me adjust it.
look, they're all all right,
i promise you.
see? look at this guy. whee.
he's still sleeping.
it's dead, dad. ow!
ooh! a porch swing.
i know what i'm doing this weekend.
now he's dead.
rob: welcome back to 1 9 7 8,
everybody. the lake house.
nothing's changed,
it's unbelievable.
marcus:
i don't remember this big.
this is my kitchen.
this is it, right now.
oh, please,
enough with the kitchen.
why you so mean?
eric: we could've done this.
ooh, an organ.
sally:
oh, my god, look at this kitchen.
deanne: that's enough, already.
could you at least humor me?
ls this like
an outward bound thing?
<i>i mean, it's like
an episode of lost.</i>
[organ playing]
hon, you might not
wanna bang on that.
but i like playing it like this.
okay. okay.
so listen, guys,
who's getting what room?
actually, i made a map
of who gets which room.
i took the liberty of reserving
the room with the waterbed
for gloria and myself.
gloria: ooh!
you're gonna do
the backstroke tonight.
ooh, ooh.
i wanna go swimming
with you guys tonight.
oh, honey, we're not really going
swimming. what i meant was--
that's okay. she doesn't
need to know what you mean.
i don't even know what you mean.
oh, i know what she meant.
[feigns vomiting]
anyway, let's get back
to the room picking.
rob, would you like
to take us on a tour?
i'd love to show you a tour.
gloria was just trying to be cool.
i need someplace near a bathroom.
why does the grandma
get to go swimming and i don't?
lenny:
let's go, let's go.
okay, here's the big daddy.
the master bedroom.
you know what? lenny should have that.
lenny should have that.
oh, no, no, no.
i agree.
honey. honey.
come on, let the kids have it.
it's a fun time for the kids to be
together and they can do kids' things.
come on, go share it.
share the master bedroom.
kids win.
yeah. yeah.
don't you think?
sally:
yeah, okay.
cool.
cool.
greg:
hey, dad.
what's the big box attached
to the back of the tv?
um, that's the rest of the tv.
they didn't always have
flat screens there, sport.
wow, that is some
stone age shiznit.
yeah, that's wack.
i need a room with heat.
it's summer.
it's like 95 degrees in here.
there he goes again.
i got bunions.
you know, i actually have a poultice
i make, using maize and herbs.
just say corn. maize
is corn, everybody.
yeah, he says maize
because it sounds more mystical.
well, i like the way
he said it. ''maize.''
''maize.''
''maize.''
''maize.''
both: ''maize.''
it's fantastic, okay?
it's a-maize-ing.
i just spread it on cloth
and i moisten and heat it,
and then i apply it directly
to the affected area.
okay. well, my affected area
is pretty big.
oh, no.
aah!
mama, i didn't know the elephant
man lived in your shoe.
how in the world's anybody
supposed to get some sleep
knowing they under the same roof
as toe-be bryant over here?
you're stepping over the line,
woman.
[rasping]
so, what's with that labradoodle?
lt sounds like stephen hawking.
curly, he had
his vocal cords clipped.
a neighbor filed a complaint,
so it was either clip the cords
or put curly down.
wrong choice.
come on, he's part
of the family, you know?
imagine when a burglar
comes over and hears that.
he must run in terror.
''wow, what's that turkey
doing in the house?''
[all laughing]
marcus: by the way,
lamonsoff, your son.
what's with the boob thing?
isn't the kid a little old?
he'll be rubbing her boob
with his beard soon.
he's gonna get a milk
mustache on a real mustache.
that won't look right.
that kid, when he's 1 0,
on his bike,
the mom's gonna be in the
basket, he's gonna be like:
greg: come on.
keithie: okay, wait, i got this one.
<i>man [on video game]:
chain saw pedicure, 50 points.</i>
why are they inside
right now, anyways?
why would they not come out
here and enjoy the lake
or do something
in the woods?
there wasn't a time of day
that i wasn't outside.
you know, we weren't. we were
always-- we were never in.
<i>all heads on deck!</i>
keithie: look, there's blood
squirting everywhere!
i can't take it anymore.
greg: chop his arms off.
marcus:
oh, he's being a dad. look at this.
greg:
dad. don't, dad. my high score.
that's it.
no more video games.
no more cell phones.
no more texting.
just from now on, while we're
here, stay outside and play.
what are we
supposed to do?
just play like normal kids.
come on, move it. where's becky?
let's go. let me show you
how the pilgrims used to hang.
when we were kids, your dad used to
talk us into doing the craziest stuff.
that's right.
yeah, i remember one time,
we got our shower curtains,
put them in shopping carts
and went shopping cart sailing.
wait, how did you steer?
well, we didn't.
how'd you stop?
you just smashed into something.
that was the fun part.
we used to shoot
bottle rockets at each other.
you go for the guy's face
because you wanna blind him.
lenny: okay, no,
that's a little much, pal.
no. no, i know.
kids, don't do that.
you know what, erase, reboot.
okay. look, look. make a tree fort.
i'll get you started.
rob lived in one
of those for a year.
why?
my dad took away
my roller skates.
uh-oh. vietnam flashback.
wait a minute.
are you kidding me?
what?
what?
lenny: whoa!
marcus: nice.
rope on a tree, baby.
you know what that means.
we get to hang ourselves?
you see a rope and a lake and that
doesn't make you wanna go nuts?
lt makes me--
you know what?
you know what,
let me show them.
lammy, yeah.
yeah, baby.
dude, get up on the top rock.
yeah, you're right.
you gotta back it up,
back it up. go, baby.
the class
is in session.
who wants to see
a double flip?
whee! too high.
now drop.
this was a mistake.
i can't let go, i'm too scared.
[screams]
all:
oh!
oh! oh!
that was awesome.
oh, god. oh, god,
my leg's snapped.
oh, my god, the bone's
sticking out. i need help.
it's a stick. i got you.
very good.
daddy, that bird is hurt.
[chirps]
oh, my god. i'll go get a shoebox.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
here you go.
hey, did you really land
on that bird, man?
um, i'm not sure.
i did hear a chirp and a crunch-like
noise, but that could've been anything.
okay.
[the romantics'
''a night like this'' playing]
lenny:
keith. sit down. sit down.
donna:
dad, i wanna sit next to you.
daddy's gonna be down here with
his friends first and then--
lenny, remember we used to come here
late night after we got wasted?
shh.
what's ''wasted''?
nice one, higgie.
''wasted,'' uh, kids,
is something that happens
when you have a hankering
for ice cream.
i wanna get wasted.
i wanna get wasted.
i wanna get wasted
every day.
i wanna get
chocolate wasted.
no, you don't need
to get wasted, it's okay.
all right, you know what,
let me make this easy.
seventeen burgers

or whatever you got.

but, mama, they do have
bunion rings if you want some.
that was good, lenny.
how about some drinks?
i said i'm paying,
so take it easy with that, okay?
i'm kidding, everybody. i'm kidding.
we can drink all we want.
i'll start it off.
i'm gonna have a coke.

sprite, correct, sweetie? and, uh...

[speaking in chinese]
[speaks in chinese]
i'm sorry, what now?
he says they have
the best burger in town here.
really? since when did you
learn to speak chinese?
it's just something i picked up
watching a cooking show.
that's great. maybe you should
focus a little less on the talking
and a little more on the cooking.
marcus:
burn.
you got told.
you got toe.
he comes back.
mommy, can i have
some of her milk?
there he is.
joe hollywood.
who's that? dickie bailey?
oh, my god.
hey, long time no see.
how you doing, man?
you know, that game
had some bad calls.
now, what game are we
talking about? the game?
what, when we were kids
that last shot?
your foot was on the line.
shouldn't have counted.
wow. i don't know.
i don't remember it quite like that.
you got the rest
of the fugly five over there, huh?
yes. yes. they are.
the boys are here.
boys?
they don't look like they can make it
up and down the court anymore.
what about you?
you put on a few pounds?
from when i was 1 2?
yes, i think so.
you don't know how
to come at me, do you?
rematch. i dare you.
wow.
ln basketball? you don't look like
you're in the greatest shape either.
i could see having
a getting-off-the-couch contest, but--
anytime, anywhere.
i was just kidding.
i really don't wanna do that.
next time you come to town, i'll have
plenty of that boss water for your kid.
all right.
wouldn't want him to go thirsty.
all right, well, just for the record,
it's voss water, by the way, with a v.
ooh.
okay.
[the del fuegos'
''i still want you'' playing]

spreading the buzzer's ashes.
oh, my god.
the coach requested that we scatter
his remains on mclntyre island.
i got a beautiful ceremony planned.
lenny, you gonna be able to do that?
what time do you leave?
what are you talking about?
what do you mean, leave?
i forgot to tell you, fellas.
we gotta take off in the morning.
you're leaving?
you can't leave.
we got the ceremony tomorrow.
lenny's just playing, everybody.
no, he's not.
are you joking?
i wanna be there. i mean, we all wanna be there.
we gotta go to milan.
milan, what? italy?
what's in milan?
it's pretty cool. roxanne's
got her fall line coming out.
fashion week.
three nights at the four seasons.
eggs benedict by the pool,
playstation 3 in every room,
and they show boobies
on italian tv.
[chuckles]
i'm going to italy.
no, we all-- i didn't tell you guys,
we're probably gonna go to italy as a--
thanks for ruining the surprise.
lenny, it's not gonna
be the same without you.
yeah, come on.
roxanne was cool enough to let us
come tonight. this is a big deal.
can't roxanne go without you
and you can meet her there?
no, we are a team, me and my lady,
and we do everything together.
last year, we had to skip
becky's school play for milan.
roxanne.
roxanne.
i thought we were
gonna get wasted.
sweetie. what was i supposed
to do, lie to them?
roxanne: it's not what you said.
it's how you said it.
i am not some insensitive
work-crazy dragon lady.
and i'm not gonna let you
depict me as one.
we are skipping the dinner
in milan,
spreading the ashes,
and we're leaving first thing
sunday morning.
[dog rasping]
[dog rasping]
lenny: lamonsoff, it's 5 in the morning.

eric:
thinking about it.
go ahead.
birdy coming through, everybody.
hey, morning.
morning.
take it right over to the table.
how we doing?
something stinks in here.
rob: gloria and i are making
breakfast for everybody.
using a dehydrator, which never
cooks anything above 1 1 5 degrees.
those are pancakes?
ocean pancakes.
they're gray. they look like you
cut them off an elephant's legs.
i'm not eating that.
it's good for you.
what is this?
''what is this?''
a scab?
it's dehydrated banana.
what happened to a normal banana?
peel a banana and eat it.
the kids'll love it. it's fun, man.
lt doesn't go bad.
you slice it thin--
i see what you do.
maybe you're right.
this is good.
ls that what it's meant for?
you could.
well, i'd rather be hit by
dehydrated fruit than processed--
processed food.
i'm just kidding around.
you think you can just slap people.
i don't think that.
don't say that. come on.
roxanne:
morning.
honey, how is the birdy?
ooh-la-la.
those are the christian
louboutin shoes.
i know i'm overdressed.
but, sorry, i packed
for milan, not the lake.
made from acorns.
so, dude, i'm not eating any of this.
you got any normal food? cereal?
would you like me to make you
egg-white frittata, mr. feder?
uh, oh...
i mean, is that what you're
doing in science class now?
making frittatas?
no. we're okay. you can go practice
that in your room, though.
i know you got
the big test coming.
you know, honey, i think
you're overwhelming lenny.
here, i got
a present for you.
bacon.
knock yourself out.
bacon. hey.
she gets it.
she gets it. she gets it.
hey, she gets it.
thank god she gets it.
lenny:
all right, so...
hey, what are you doing?
cooking the bacon.
rob: not in here. that's
dead animal flesh.
it's not going near
the vegan food.
murderer.
fine. what do i do
with it? oh, i know.
i'm sorry, buddy.
i'm sorry.
[farts]
curly. shame on you.
that crazy dog.
must have got into some
of my leftover pasta fasul.
yeah, mama, i'm sure
that's exactly what happened.
mama:
lt did.
we should get a dog.
heh. we should get
a water buffalo. whoo!
[kids laughing]
higgins, what are you doing?
marcus: i don't wear
pants at my house,
i'm not wearing them in your house.
sorry.
that was a man's ass?
all right.
[electricity crackling]
yeah.
let's see this. look at that.
ooh. ooh.
that's it, buddy.
okay, throw the rock.
skim it.
throw it at a tree.
throw it at the lake.
throw it at your brother.
hit your head with it.
just do something.
<i>[♪]</i>
[sighs]
come on.
what are you doing dressed like that?
you hanging out with jiminy cricket?
we were supposed to be going
to milan, remember?
that's what i packed for.
just cut those into shorts.
we'll play some hoop later.
pass, dude.
you don't want revenge
for the time i whupped you?
that was four years ago, homey.
all i want is to fly to milan
and have some fresh-made gelato.
ouch.
wow. what would your father
have done on that one?
that one would've been a
backhand to the side of the head
and possible bleeding
from the ear.
my father would've thrown me down the
stairs for using the word ''gelato.''
ah, you got the new foreman.
lenny: yeah.
hilliard was trying to make me
some tofu grape-nuts in there.
lenny:
try it out.
you cleaned this?
yeah, i cleaned this thing.
take it.
thanks a lot.
lenny: by the way,
mclntyre island ain't close.
eat as much as you can,
we got a big row ahead of us.
you didn't clean that well.
come on, man. what are you
doing to me? seriously.
you don't want your breath to smell
like your grandmother's closet?
[bob seger & the silver bullet band's
''rock and roll never forgets'' playing]
lenny:
slow down for robbie, guys.
rob:
you're gonna lap me.
beautiful. you gotta respect
going to mclntyre island.
haven't done that since we're 1 2.
marcus:
got my first boob there.
i know. tracy thornhill.
marcus: tracy thorn--
yes.
lenny: absolutely.
a little flat,
but i was a fan.
all right, higgins. ls that all
you think about is chicks?
lenny: we got daughters.
that's all you guys think about.
difference is, i can do something.
not true. all right, that's true.
you wanna know
what i fantasize about?
candy bars.
kurt:
candy bars?
no, i had a bad blood-sugar test at
my last checkup and sally cut me off.
you're a grown man,
how do you deal with that?
oh, i got my own hidden stash,
i'm not stupid.
seriously, i got it all.
i got reese's, butterfingers,
i hide them under my clothes
in the bottom of the hamper.
it's great because the smell in my
sweat socks mask the chocolate smell.
and the looks of your underwear
masks the chocolate stains.
hey, hey, hey, hang on, guys.
i gotta make a sissy.
no, no, no.
i gotta make a sissy.
you made three already.
lt must be just oozing out
at this point.
shut up, i'm trying to concentrate.
it's taking a piss, not the sats.
[urinating intermittently]
are you peeing or is a diesel truck
turning off? what the hell is that?
marcus:
listen to hamper bottom.
i think he's sending a message
in morse code.
getting old. stop.
can't pee. stop.
reeks like asparagus. stop.
even though i didn't even
have any. stop.
the good news is these girls
are gonna say hi to it.
lenny: what's up, ladies?
rob: hey, girls.
girl 1 : that is so gross-looking.
girl 2: did you see that?
they don't all look like that, ladies.
you gave that thing 300 pounds--
aah! come on.
[triumph's ''lay it on the line''
playing over radio]
lenny:
sick mix tape you made, robbie.
eric:
oh, yeah.
hey, guys, i brought
something too.
get out of here.
it's the net, yeah.
championship game.
let me see that.
i thought the coach should have it.
robbie, you gotta put this
on the urn, buddy.
eric:
that's cool.
lenny: ''your foot was on the line.''
marcus: ugh. bailey.
what do you think the coach would've
said if he heard that trash-talking?
he'd kick our ass
for not kicking his.
yeah.
or we do it the old-school way.
have eric beat his ass for us.
i know, we should.
no, no, no. i got about eight seconds
of fighting, total, left in my life.
and i'm saving that in case
i get mugged,
or, you know, someone cuts
in front of me at burger king.
lenny: that's my hamper bottom.
we can't delay it anymore, guys.
he just bit his chicken. all right.
are we going? okay.
kurt:
let's do it.
you know, i think the coach
is here with us.
i think he's proud to be here
with us in ash form.
right here on this island,
where we hid from our parents
and where we're hiding
from our wives and children.
yes, we are.
goodbye to you,
friend...
wise-advice giver...
buzzer-noise maker.
[sobbing]
rob, come on.
i really messed up
my marriages.
all of them.
lt was my fault, man.
i just couldn't hang on.
you know,
my own daughters,
i don't even
hardly know them.
the buzzer would be ashamed of me.
lenny: no.
come on, now.
you got time to patch things up
with your daughters.
you just call them
when you get back.
actually, they're gonna be here
in about 20 minutes.
wait, what?
i can use a piece of chicken.
lenny: no, not with those hands.
coach hands. all right.
finish the bucket.
actually, i'm still gonna eat it.
this is pretty sick, but i'm hungry.

[car approaching]
piece of crap car.
what?
hey, dad.
all:
me?
what?
kurt: how do you get that
hey.
from that?
ninety-five percent of that's
gotta be from the mother.
and i am lowballing.
hey, jasmine.
eric:
how is that possible?
marcus: oh, no. the elvis
hairs are going up her nose.
she doesn't know what to do.
that's sweet.
ls this your car?
my old man lent me this turd.
because he doesn't care if i break
down in the middle of nowhere
and get eaten by a bear.
your old man?
yeah, my boyfriend.
forty-seven years old.
you know, i wish i liked
guys my own age,
but i'm just chasing the dad
that ran out on me.
hoochie mama.
what does
that mean?
i don't know, but it feels right.
mmm. i hope that car
never gets fixed.
marcus:
i don't think it will.
i took the spark plugs out.
nice.
we're all looking at the same time.
let's at least take shifts.
lamonsoff, you and me
look at the tree.
mckenzie, we're gonna look
at her butt for a little bit.
all right. good plan.
and, shift.
shift.
shift.
shift.
shift.
shift.
lenny:
and shift.
what are we doing?
wait, are we all looking
at the tree right now?
yeah. let's go back
to the ass.
hey, jasmine.
this is gloria.
gloria, this is jasmine.
hi.
oh, look, here comes
grandma gloria to the rescue.
let me take a look.
oh, honey.
you've blown your gasket.
[''escape (the piña colada
song )'' playing]
no good.
wow.
lenny:
that was rough.
eric: if you guys thought seeing
them at the car was gross,
you should have heard
that waterbed action.
sounded like two grizzlies
fighting over a salmon.
there was a lot happening.
at least he's getting something.
i've been shut out since deanne
found out she was pregnant.
that'll happen.
marcus:
you have sex when they're pregnant?
does that hurt the baby?
mckenzie can.
the baby thinks he's
getting a tootsie roll.
that's good.
snickers. snickers.
a little bigger.
a little bigger.
i got lucky on saint paddy's day,
but she was half-asleep.
and by half-asleep,
i mean she was asleep.
yeah, she was out. yeah.
lenny:
you're allowed to do that.
eric:
she'd rather not be awake.
hey, how'd it go
with the daughter?
awkward.
i guess the first 20 years of a kid's
life is more important than i realized.
yeah. it's always the kids who pay.
kids pay.
they pay.
they pay.
they always pay.
but they pay with maize.
was good hanging with you guys.
no, no, no. we're catching up.
come on, man.
i'm glad my family turmoil can
provide entertainment for you guys.
let's cheer him up. how did we
cheer robbie up in the old days?
a little arrow roulette?
whoa, whoa, whoa.
arrow roulette.
did we really do that?
single stupidest thing we ever did.
lt was the craziest.
moronic.
asinine.
all right, fellas.
i can't believe we're doing this.
how do we always let lenny
talk us into the stupidest stuff?
remember, whoever stays
in the circle the longest wins.
i don't like that part.
whoever stays longest.
okay, guys, here we go.
and a one. and a two...
why are we doing this?
lenny:
go.
hold.
i don't see it.

kurt: nobody touch him.
shh! shh!
we're gonna be all right here.
all we need is a poultice with
some maize that will draw--

i do.
now, see that, buddy?
i did the old bank shot.
bank's open. pick a spot. aim for it.
oh, yeah. your dad'll go

the bank shot never works.

it and get a wii-fund.

i'm having this many.
cheers.
sally:
i'm breast-feeding, i don't drink.
i'm just having metamucil tonight.
what's wrong with you guys?
we used to come up here
and party, man, and get wasted.
you losers.
don't worry, you'll grow up one day.
you just have to meet the right girl.
oh, my older sister
would be perfect for you.
what?
she's legally blind,
but she can see shapes.
mmm.
anyways, roxanne,
how did you and lenny meet?
that's a good question.
how did this blob of crap,
no offense,
meet this lovely señorita?
oh, he came into the department
store where i was working.
i helped him.
he wanted me
to try this skirt on.
oh, the old
''try on the skirt'' trick.
i got you. very sneaky, sis.
yeah, he did trick me. afterwards
he made me try on a bra and--
hey, i was just trying to help.
deanne: exactly.
okay, okay. i did like him a little.
lt was a good day.
oh, god! oh, my water.
my water's breaking.
the baby's coming!
are you serious?
oh, yeah.
sally:
oh, you.
oh, my god.
i got you, i got you, i got you.

i'm just playing.
[bob welch's ''sentimental

oh, my god, it's...
do you know this song?
oh, this song's the best.
this song is the best.
oh, this song gets me so horny.
deanne: you know, i was thinking
that, but now not so much.
i'd like to claim credit for that.
because that's all part of my
''get some nookie'' playlist.
get the ladies on the dance floor,
and i got my lady right here.
come on, honey.
that was a really good move.
let's do this.
marcus:
yeah, you guys dance.
eric: lt has been a while.
sally: a long while.
i know how much
you love to dance.
oh, you know me,
i'm a regular shabba-doo.
look at you.
all sexy. deanne.
you should change your name
to deyoncé.
oh, god.
yeah, so now he thinks
i'm sexy, huh?
can i just enjoy a dance
with my fine-ass wife?
yes. to the whitest
song ever. yes.
yes, this is the whitest song
i've ever heard.
you know, lenny, you were right
about bringing us here.
this place is really special.
lt is, right?
nothing's going on here,
and i love it.
roxanne, i have made out with about
and i want you
to be number 26.
as long as i'm the last one.
oh, that's a guarantee.
marcus:
i'm horny too.
hey, what are you doing?
you idiot.
[whispering] lamonsoff.
what are you doing up?
[both laughing]
[whispering]
i gotta tell you, it was crazy.
what?
sally. she just attacked me.
like never before.
lt was insane.
i just did the same thing
with my woman.
really? wow.
hey, where's saskatchetoon?
yeah. i don't know.
gloria: what am i?
rob: a hoseteaser.
gloria: and where are you from?
rob: saskatchetoon.
look at this.
gloria: and what am i?
rob: a hoseteaser.
gloria: and where are you from?
rob: saskatchetoon.
what are we gonna do
with higgins?
yeah, and you know what?
this is what pisses me off:
you can't be passed-out drunk, single,
with no responsibility and not pay.
you have to be hurt for that.
yeah.
[whistles]
[in high-pitched voice]
sweetheart?
you fell asleep on the couch again.
[in high-pitched voice] you know
you supposed to go to your room.
you're bad.
marcus:
no.
marcus, the bird is all better.
marcus. he wants
to talk to you.
[marcus groans]
marcus, you're gonna be the best
lifeguard at the whole pool.
hold your breath, honey.
hold your breath, honey.
[snorts]
lenny:
shh.
who's that?
oh, it's mommy's boyfriend.
the one who touches you.
[whistling]
[sobbing]
he's crying, he's crying.
all right, quiet.
marcus: hi, mama.
all right. it's all right.
mama?
okay, baby. it's okay, precious.
mama?
i'm gonna take you upstairs.
go and put your pj's on, okay?
you can't fall asleep--
you can't just sleep anywhere,
you know that.
you go to your room.
marcus: go to sleep.
you go to your room.
eric: what you doing?
shh. come here.
this isn't a closet.
this is your bedroom.
okay? it's also your bathroom.
you can make a pee-pee.
[bod y thuds]

donna: bye, birdy.
eric: she's flying.
lenny: she's gonna be a veterinarian.
ls this girl incredible or what?
[fleetwood mac's
''monday morning'' playing]
[speaking in spanish]
that's so sexy.
what did you say?
oh, i think that she said:
[imitates spanish]
--milan.
you know, these guys at the store
were talking so much smack
about this basketball rematch
that's supposed to go on.
roxanne: well, i'm glad we're
getting these uniforms ready.
no more drinkie. ahh.
did you really sleep
in the closet, you drunk?
[groans]
think so.
no. ow.
oh, god, higgins.
amber: that's disgusting.
deanne: you slob.
oh, i had the sexiest dream about a
little blond girl, though. hey-yi.
i think it was a dream.
oh, nice. classy.
sick.
[vibrating]
mama: these deviled eggs would really
be good if you had some marinara sauce.
oh, it's lenny's phone.
hello?
all right, here we go.
oh, that's a three.
that's one, two, three,
ladder. ladder.
oh, that's it.
the rich keep getting richer.
lenny: all right. all right.
schniggly is here.
so, come on, robbie,
tell the man what's going on.
he doesn't care.
tell him.
what are you talking about? tell him.
gloria and i are thinking
about having a baby.
how great is that?
wow. that's great.
you know, the good news is she
can't get any more stretch marks.
wow. boy, that's a good one.
come on.
you know, the good thing also is
gloria and the kid can share diapers.
man. you see,
that's just ugly.
he doesn't get it. he's not
in a committed relationship.
he can't, because he can't stay
in a committed relationship.
oh, look. he's just mad
because all the girls i go out with
are 70 to 80 years younger
than his wife.
can't stop.
the last one i was with, she's blond,
she's tall, super hot. not your type.
me and blondie, we start going at it
and we're shaking the bed--
shaking the bed?
what does shaking the bed mean?
i don't know, i just know wetting
the bed. i don't know...
and then, right at the ''good part,''
you know?
this picture behind,
right on the wall, falls and goes:
hits her on the forehead.
she cut her head.
lt cuts her. i didn't slow down.
i just throw her two aspirins,
she yaps on them like a frisbee dog.
i am tired. marcus, your snoring
kept me up all night long.
<i>[♪]</i>
[lenny imitates buzzer]
you're a dead man.
get back here.
come back here. that's my baby girl.
i thought you were my friend.
marcus:
leave me alone. drink your maize.
rob:
you're gonna pay this time.
you bastard.
i'll show you how to be nice.
bad turtles.
you evil pig.
robbie, wait.
marcus: he's psycho.
eric:
stop. stop.
hey, break it up, man.
jeez, guys.
all right.
calm down.
buddy. buddy.
what's the problem?
[screams]
ah! ah!
oh, yeah. arrow foot.
come here, baby. whee!
come on. why are you fighting?
good to see midget
wrestling again.
how could you do that?
that's my daughter.
do what?
shake the bed with her.
you think i would
do that to you?
out of any of us
you'd be the one to do that.
you did sleep
with stimpson's mother.
i didn't even know that guy.
he was your friend.
i barely knew him.
she grabbed my wiener,
i told you guys.
that's his daughter. it's different.
me and him?
okay. maybe i flirted with him,
but that was just to get your attention.
well, what about his snoring?
i heard it too.
[imitates buzzer]
aah!
ah!
oh, no. twice?
we heard it from
three rooms away.
he's off the hook. you know marcus
wouldn't be with your daughter.
i mean, not that she's--
you know what i'm saying.
well, what happened
to your head?
when i was changing
into my pjs,
i got the feeling that some perv
was looking through my window,
so i went to go close the shade
and i tripped and hit my head.
yeah, dude,
that's your daughter.
i'd never be with her.
you're my best friend, man.
and jasmine'd never be
with me, because i'm me.
look, sorry i don't have my whole
life together, like lenny.
oh, together,
like lenny.
please.
<i>i answered your phone,
hipócrita.</i>
lt was your assistant.
i asked him if he canceled the
flight to milan. he said he did.
before we even
came here.
he said that? why would
he say that? i mean...
so he just made that up, huh?
i'm not saying he made it up.
i'm think--
ln his head he believes it's true.
don't you agent me, lenny.
stop trying to handle
everybody and everything,
and start taking a little
responsibility for once.
i'll take responsibility.
okay? you're right.
i thought it would be better for our
family to be here with normal people
instead of going to milan.
we're normal?
i was scared to tell you. lt was
easier for me to keep it a secret.
you peel back any marriage,
there are secrets.
mine is i love you.
i love you very much.
roxanne, i just-- i--
our kids are becoming nutty,
snotty, spoiled...
we got a nanny, we got--
so she is a nanny.
no, no, no. she's not a nanny.
of course she's a nanny.
when does the lying stop?
lt stops right after this.
she's more of an au pair.
not a nanny.
lenny.
all right. that's it.
the lying stops now.
i won't lie to you ever again.
i swear to god.
i love you.
men lie.
they can't help themselves.
kurt sure as hell lies.
what do i lie about,
toe-j simpson?
oh, please.
the nanny.
kurt:
what about the nanny?
you have a thing for her.
i do not have a thing for the nanny.
i'm a married man. period.
but did i enjoy a nice conversation
with a woman that wasn't going,
''where's this?'' and
''did you pick up that?'' yeah.
what, you can have
nice conversations with me.
when? you're always working.
and when you come home,
you're just tired all the time.
you barely even touch me
or look at me.
mama:
he sounds like an old woman.
deanne, you should have married
umberto denunzio like i told you.
and if i had stayed with him you'd be
the one that's pregnant now, mama.
you probably right,
sweetheart.
i'll just butt out.
thank you.
look, maybe i do take you
for granted, and i'm sorry.
how's about i take you out every
thursday night for date night.
<i>no, thursday's grey's anatomy,
but any other night would be beautiful.</i>
<i>[♪]</i>
and as long as
we're all being honest,
i think i should be honest too.
i'm actually not a part owner
of the lawn furniture store.
i don't even work there
anymore.
i got laid off in april.
but i rented the caddy
and i acted like a big shot because
i didn't want you guys to know.
lamonsoff.
you don't have to hide
anything from us. i'm sorry.
yeah. since we're getting
things off our chests here,
i got a confession to make.
i'm wearing a toup.
no shit.
[both laughing]
i have a confession to make.
i'm really a man.
no.
i said that.
sally: are you kidding?
no, i'm just kidding. i'm just kidding.
i'm really a little hurt that so many
of you believed it.
we were just saying that--
eric: you're very womanly.
nevertheless. i know
it's not my place, but, uh...
well, after all,
i am older than anyone here.
hell, yeah, you are.
well, despite the joking and
the razzing, i see a lot of love here.
and with love comes hostility.
like rob when he snapped
at me the other day.
that was scary.
and you all thought that
i was so calm, but inside?
inside i was saying,
''gloria noonan,
do not call him a bug-eyed sociopath
with a little-man complex.
do not say that his hair makes him
look like a dirty q-tip.''
i like that.
''or that he resembles an elder gay
jonas brother.''
they get it. they get the point
of where you're going.
''or a midget filipino fonzie.''
i didn't say those things.
that's my favorite one.
lenny: hey.
toupee.
life can be difficult sometimes.
lt gets bumpy,
what with family and kids
and things not going
exactly like you planned.
but that's what
makes it interesting.
ln life, the first act, always exciting.
the second act,
that's where the depth comes in.
<i>[♪]</i>
why didn't you ever tell us
that she gets it?
yeah, you were holding out.
that's what i've been
trying to tell you guys.
that was beautiful, honey.
that was beautiful.

investment for me, man.

it's gonna be a goldmine.
i don't wanna take your money.
you're making me more.
i want in, okay?
i know the owner of the celtics.
and i can get us that account.
those guys all drive
bentleys and ferraris.
how do you know
the owner of the celtics?
hey, i'm the leader of his
daughter's girl scout troop.
if he wants to make sure
she gets her cookie biz badge,
he will give us that account.
i love you guys.
i love it. i love it.
rob:

yeah. hit it.
[engine accelerating]
okay.
go. go. you gotta get it in high.

i don't know.
[laughs]
look, we just wanna eat watermelon and
relax, if you're all right with that.

oh, hey, wiley.

yeah. first time
i ever heard that one.

heard that one a lot too.
seriously, dickie, let us just hang out
with our families. we wanna relax.
yeah. they're afraid of us.
that's what it is.
we're afraid you might eat the ball
before we even start the game.
same old higgins.
he can talk the talk but he can't...
i forget the rest.
booyah!
we got rob here with the bad foot.
you can't do it, right, buddy?
i think if the buzzer was here,
he'd want me to try.
i think he'd want us all to try.
