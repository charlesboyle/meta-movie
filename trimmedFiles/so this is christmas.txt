¶
( sirens blaring )
( indistinct chattering )
( sobbing )
( woman speaking
indistinctly over p.a. )
we have an 18-year-old male
with gunshot wounds
to the leg and shoulder.
one, two, three.
yep. he's on something.
jason. i need to talk to jason.
soon. just not now.
get her into pre-op.
how did you get in?
i...i heard the gunshots,
and i rushed to the back door.
( sniffling )
what'd you do to jason?
huh?
can i see a doctor?
baby, the police are outside.
and if you're up to it,
they want to talk to you.
i'll take care of ashley,
mr. lane.
thank you, brother.
( machine beeps )
so...
how did you end up
at your brother's girlfriend's
house last night?
we were working on...
christmas costumes for my play.
where'd you get the money
we found in your possession?
we were raising that money
at the garage sale yesterday.
see, this past fall,
things had gotten pretty bad...
at school,
at home.
man: this year's production,
<i>holiday cheer,</i> has been penned
by yours truly.
( scattered applause )
all right,
so when i call your name,
just come up to the stage
and state the part
you'll be reading.
uh, monica tishauer.
( clears throat )
i'll be reading for betty,
the garbage girl.
just look at what
i found in my garbage truck.
i'll have the best-decorated
house in town.
( snickering )
this is garbage.
( sighs ) man: ashley lane?
ashley lane?
people, time is of the essence.
last call for ashley lane.
right.
karen snow?
( sighs )
( sighs )
idiot.
how will you know
if you will ever do anything
if you can never do anything?
( sighs )
( gasps )
how'd it go?
it went.
i decided that
i didn't have time. so...
should at least try.
yeah? you didn't.
it's gonna be stupid anyway.
( affecting accent )
oh, but ms. lane,
you'd be missing out
on such a wonderful
high school experience.
nicki, drop dead.
( sighs )
¶ listen closely
¶ or you'll never
hear me whisper ¶
¶ all the pretty things.
¶ i'm scared to say out loud ¶
¶ in my mind i know
¶ all i can do is kiss you
( dog barking )
¶ but i'm caught between the
curtain and the crowd ¶
forgot to pick up jason. ah.
he's been waiting a half an hour.
( sighs )
well, he's 17.
he'll get over it.
would it bother you so much
if it was ashley i forgot?
forget about it. i'm going.
i'm going.
thank you, bill.
( sighs )
how about let's just have an
early dinner tonight, huh, baby?
uh, tonight's no good.
i already made plans
with phyllis and claire.
maybe next time.
okey-dokey.
i know...
( music playing indistinctly )
drive you home?
no, it's okay, mr. lane.
i gotta meet someone.
but, uh, catch y'all later.
( sniffing )
fasten your seatbelt.
it wasn't me. it was nicki.
mm-hmm.
( seatbelt clicks )
( music stops )
( sighs )
i think your mother...
you mean your wife? ( sighs )
you've got to stop
hanging out with nicole.
when we get home,
i want you to put those
clothes in the laundry.
they smell like smoke.
i saw that.
( jason coughing ) geez!
who reeks in here?
this must be you,
ashtray lane, right?
( no audible dialogue )
so jason, how was practice?
( sighs ) brutal.
captain hit the hurdle full-on.
he's probably
out for the season.
but hopefully i get my shot
at being captain now.
really?
it could happen. right?
i mean, who else
would coach pick, anyway?
someone with better grades.
¶ father, lay your hand
upon my head ¶
¶ i said it's
only consolation ¶
¶ although we
have the same disease ¶
¶ i'm afraid we may
need different medication ¶
where's mom?
at some committee thing.
right.
yo. think fast, brainless.
( laughs ) ( groans )
¶ sit down
¶ and...
hey, where you going?
uh...
just gonna go meet up
and study with angel tonight.
look, uh...
if i don't get off probation
this semester,
then i can't run track.
and we both know how disappointed
that would make mom, right?
( whispers ) yeah. sorry.
where're your books?
¶ so relax
¶ sit down
¶ and talk to...
i'm gonna go get some chicken.
anybody...
wanna come?
nicki, big surprise...
sharon is out. ( sighs )
and all i have to do
is homework and laundry.
dad's picking up dinner.
so you're alone?
cain's club time.
uh, i don't...
( scoffs ) he's gonna be back.
so?
just leave him a note.
okay, meet me in 15.
( exhales deeply )
( motorcycle engine idling )
hey, there.
hey.
what's your name?
they all go off and leave you?
willy, huh?
( making clicking noises )
thank you very much.
we just met.
wanna come out and play?
huh?
come on.
( whistling )
billy.
( whistling ) come on.
( sniffs ) you...
you really stink.
we have to work on that.
( groans )
( groans )
nice.
( grunts )
i've got to go.
but i'll be back.
see you later.
( dance music playing )
so this beats
doing laundry, huh?
i mean, just a little?
i can't find my cigarettes.
you and your dad
not so disney these days.
sharon and me...
like a total train wreck.
( clatters )
you got a light?
man: have we met before?
trust me...
if we had, you'd remember.
dance?
boy: hey, jason!
( laughing and chattering )
first-timers.
hey. keep it down.
( chuckling )
( lilting voice ) i got money.
( chuckles ) um...
i was just going
down to angel's.
you could drop me off there.
( singsong voice ) i am...
superman.
i can do anything.
man, you... you blew me away
at practice today.
you think maybe, uh...
you could teach me
to do distance?
( laughing )
i'm not a miracle worker, baby.
( sighs )
just superman.
go ahead, jazz.
i'll advance you...
again.
hey, hey, hey. ( laughs )
that's... that's mine.
rich boy's good for it.
nobody gets deep into me.
( grunts )
( sighs ) i still owe you?
you jocks aren't very good
with numbers, are you?
$120.
what?! i-i just
gave you a hundred.
you haven't give me jack.
your parties are never
gonna be on me.
i'll get it to you, g.
tomorrow, jazz.
and forget about angel.
she doesn't own you.
( grunts )
hello?
( slurring speech )
wait a minute.
( laughs )
this isn't...
this isn't the washroom.
( groans )
hello?
you know, this isn't exactly the best
neighborhood to be passing out in.
where's your date?
( slurring speech )
i'm not allowed to date.
i am a princess. ( chuckling )
shh.
shh.
( laughing )
oh...
( whimpers )
all right, let's get you home.
( laughing )
( laughing ) ( grunts )
what... great... hair.
( laughing )
( sighs )
whoo.
yay.
( sighs )
well, princess,
where do you live?
at home.
( slurring speech )
would you like to kiss me?
definitely not. ( grunts )
why not?
am i ugly?
( gasps ) no.
your breath stinks.
i like you, too.
look, i've got to be at work
early tomorrow,
and if you want a ride home,
just tell me where you live.
otherwise, out of the van.
( singsong voice ) 5...3...3...
parkwood drive.
you know...
you're not very nice.
i am <i>not</i>
going to dance with you.
hey, baby.
sharon: hey.
how was dinner?
didn't go too well.
i missed you.
did you have a good time?
( sighs )
we were trying to motivate
the denby company
to conform to green standards.
mm-hmm.
i have been working,
and i am tired.
i'm green.
did you feed that dog?
ah...
i told jason to do it.
the dog is not jason's
little brother.
and it's not gonna make up
for the fact
that we don't
have a child together.
wow.
( sighs )
( sighs )
what are you doing?
( laughing )
( breathing heavily )
bill: i thought you were
in your room not feeling well.
i am not.
sharon: where have you been?
and what are you wearing?!
( slurring speech )
that's too many questions.
i only do one at a time, okay?
it is not okay.
are you drunk?
you been drinking?
oh, give it a rest, sharon.
i seem to remember you
getting hammered
a time or two
when you were younger.
bill: come here, baby.
okay, daddy.
put your hand around daddy.
oh... real neat.
i love you. i know.
( groans ) can i have
some cookies and milk?
you know you're
better than this.
i wish i had a real mom.
<i>( thunder crashing )</i>
( indistinct chattering
over police radio )
you remind me so much
of amanda.
my little princess.
sharon hates me.
oh, no she doesn't.
she does not hate you.
she just gets disappointed
when you do things
like tonight.
i'm disappointed, too.
( whispers )
but i still love you.
good night, princess.
why do you
disappoint sharon, daddy?
( breathes deeply )
( sighs )
whoa. ( coughs )
who beat you up last night?
( sighs )
( sighs ) you look like trash.
no response?
okay. cool. ( sniffles )
oh, yeah. here you go.
want some breakfast?
you can have as much
as you want.
i made enough for everybody.
( retching ) what?
( retching continues )
okay.
more for me.
( sniffles )
( sniffles )
i actually feel better.
i bet you do.
( chuckles )
just wanna die now.
well, here's a little
trick i learned.
( sniffles )
( coughs )
peppermint schnapps.
( sighs ) drink some of this.
you'll feel better. come on.
( sniffles )
ooh. oh, that's good.
( chuckles )
( breathing deeply )
i owe you.
ah, actually,
funny that you say that.
i, uh...
could use some money right now.
hmm. hmm.
you and everybody else.
y... what?
what am i supposed
to do with $5?
i can't... sharon: good morning.
jay,
haven't seen you in a while.
what's been keeping <i>you</i> busy?
that was your fault
last night, mom.
what are you talking about?
while you were at your
meeting thing,
i was hittin' the books.
all right, um,
i happen to be free tonight
if you wanna go grab dinner
or something,
just the two of us. you're on.
i'll pick you up after practice.
all right.
bye, baby.
( whispers ) feel better.
sharon.
about last night...
i'm sorry.
i guess i just...
makin' a play
for your father's attention?
again?
i'm just trying to...
well i'm trying to keep peace
for your father's sake.
can't you at least do that?
keep peace? mm-hmm.
yeah.
yeah, i can... i can do that.
good. ( phone ringing )
( sighs )
"good morning, dad."
hello, kids.
( clears throat )
( sighs )
"i'll make you coffee, dad."
thank you, honey.
"i'll do the dishes, dad."
thank you, jason.
( groans )
make it strong, bill.
make it strong.
( mutters )
what is that?
here you go. thank you, baby.
you're welcome.
sharon? yeah.
could we agree
to cut down on some things?
i'm not spending
anything extra.
no, but your lunches and your
dinners with your friends
really add up.
maybe if you did something
with a future.?
lane publishing
was daddy's baby.
but not ours.
your lobbying job
pays practically nothing.
well, at least i'm
contributing to society.
i'd like you to contribute
more to our finances.
this house is worth
less than half
of what we paid for it.
were are serious
underwater, baby.
you're not thinking
of selling it, are you?
we can't.
we don't have enough equity
to pay off the mortgage.
( doorbell rings )
i'll get it.
i was on my way out, anyway.
have a nice day.
hi, there. i noticed you might
need some maintenance
work done.
bill!
hi.
uh, what can i do for you?
i hope i can help you.
i just finished several jobs
for you neighbors.
uh, the alexanders, proudfoots,
and mr. wilson.
they can all tell you
about my work. mmm.
thanks, but i really...
if i may. uh...
some areas...
( sighs )
need serious repair.
i know. believe me.
uh, look, thanks, but i can't...
i can't really "afford" any...
extra help right now.
i'm a good worker
and i'm open to barter.
uh... what do you
have in trade?
( squeaks )
( sighs )
nicki,
how did i get home last night?
nicki: <i>i don't know, but...</i>
<i>i got home in a '65 mustang.</i>
<i>are you home now?</i>
( sighs ) and hung over.
<i>( chuckling ) you lush.</i>
<i>meet me at "hooker
on a stump."</i> okay.
( gasps ) whoa.
nice shoes.
school let out early today?
and you are?
mac.
dad hired me
to work on the house.
brilliant.
i'm just on my way
to audition
for a christmas play.
when you see my dad,
will you tell him that?
and that i'll be a little late.
okay?
( squeaking )
( child shouting indistinctly )
ashley: hey. oh.
hey.
do you wanna go
to a house party tonight?
sharon's too burned.
i have to be back home
before she and jason
get back from dinner.
just come for a little while.
but you're, uh,
gonna have to wear something
a <i>little</i> better than that.
no money.
( scoffs )
you know... come here.
you don't have to always
pay for everything.
nicki,
you shoplift?
( snickers )
where do you think
i get all my stuff?
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>
( knocking )
hello, angelina.
( exhales sharply )
hi, mr. i.
um, i made this shirt
for jason.
i hand-embroidered it.
you don't think it's
too feminine, do you?
no. it reminds me
of what i used to wear.
jason's having dinner
with his mother.
really? yeah.
you don't have to lie
if he's with another girl.
oh. come in.
so,
what makes you think
he wouldn't be having dinner
with his mother?
i never see him anymore.
saw him last night.
or doesn't studying
count anymore?
no, i haven't seen jason
in two weeks.
new friends are such scumbags.
what new friends
you talking about?
did jason make this?
yes, he did.
that was his christmas present
to me last year.
he made me a beautiful
jewelry box.
you know we plan to have
our own business someday?
me doing the whole
clothes-design thing,
and jason doing his woodwork.
( chuckles )
nice.
so maybe he's been
spending more time at the shop.
nice try.
but they haven't seen him
in over a month.
he even left a rocker
he was working on half-finished.
i don't know what
to tell you, baby.
well, just give him this.
i'll have a talk with him.
no. i'm the one that needs
to have a talk with im.
you're really okay, mr. i.
( chuckles ) thank you.
sometimes i wonder.
( laughs )
okay, well, i'm gonna go.
have a good day, baby. thanks.
so, what's been
keeping my track star
away from home so much?
it's not a girl, is it?
no, uh-uh.
( sniffles )
as a matter of fact,
i stood up angel last night
so i could study.
you're still seeing her?
( sighs )
does her mother
still work at wal-mart?
whoa! mom, for real?
come on... her mom's cool,
all right?
i mean, besides, i might need
to get a job there, myself.
you get an allowance.
yeah, but dad's cutting back
till i get my grades up.
i need money <i>now.</i>
for what?
something wrong?
nuh-uh.
my cross-trainers
just gettin' old.
( both chuckling ) i forgot.
at your age, things get old five
minutes ago, right? mmm? ( chuckles )
how much you need, baby?
for cross-trainers?
well, i mean,
the whole team's gettin'
these leather jackets, right?
( stammering ) i guess i could
settle for a nylon jacket,
but i know you don't want your boy
rocking no nylon jacket at school.
( chuckles )
i only got 150, jay.
no, that's cool. that's cool.
that's enough for the shoes.
but we can go shopping together
for that jacket, right?
i mean, you...
you can charge it, right?
( chuckles ) right.
( both chuckling )
you're the best, mom.
( paper tearing )
i love you, too, baby.
so, baby, i <i>know</i> i haven't
been to the track meets lately,
and i'm sorry, but you know i've been
working hard with this committee.
you know? go green. yeah.
but i really wanna
talk to you about that angel.
what? i don't like her.
huh? ( stammering )
i just don't.
i-i just feel like she's...
in the way of your future.
she's needy. she didn't
even do anything to you.
she's needy. just saying.
( chuckles )
okay, okay.
you need to try something new.
new like what? what's new?
keep it movin'.com.
what is that?
did you just make that up?
well, maybe. ( chuckles )
okay. might be a site with
some new booty on it.
mom! ( laughing )
ahh. ( jason chuckling )
the jacket looks nice on you.
right?
thank you. thank you to my mom.
( chuckles )
why are you
sitting in the dark?
where were you last night?
uh... i-i was studying
like i told you.
you haven seen angelina
in weeks.
i just figured that
studying with angel would...
um, just distract me
a little bit.
he already told me.
just where have you been going?
bill... i asked you a question.
the library. what... a guy
tries to do the right thing,
and i get jumped for it?
are you trying
to do the right thing?
yes... ( stammering )
your father's finished
with his questions.
go on upstairs and study, baby.
well,
you've managed to ruin
a perfectly lovely evening.
bill: <i>just trying to make him
live up to his responsibilities.</i>
<i>he only comes home</i>
<i>long enough to eat</i>
and to ask for more money.
sharon: like your daughter's
home more?
my son's an athlete,
and one day he's
going to be important.
he's important now, sharon.
has it ever occurred to you
that jason
doesn't even
wanna be an athlete?
then why is he trying so hard
to make captain?
he's not. if you'd come to any
of his track meets, you'd know.
he... he'll never be captain.
your daughter's the loser.
and she dresses
like trailer trash.
( sobbing )
bill: <i>if ashley's mother</i>
<i>was home once in a while...</i>
oh, please. i'm up in this
dump more than i care to be.
charming.
if a... maybe,
<i>maybe if we</i>
<i>got this place together...</i>
let's get you back.
( sighs )
no life, huh?
this is gross.
it may not look like
much now, but, uh,
wait till i get the drapes up.
this place is a hole.
it just... needs a little love.
( sighs )
yeah.
well, don't we all?
why don't you put this on?
it's...
warmer.
( sighs )
( sniffles ) ( sighing )
and why don't you
take care of willy?
bill: what, did you guys
buy out the entire store?
sneaking in again?
i just fed willy.
thank you, baby.
what was she wearing?
( chuckles ) looked like it
was from a thrift store.
( sighs )
( sniffing )
jason, i need to talk to you!
are you sure you wouldn't
rather talk to my father?
i came to see <i>you.</i>
you weren't home.
why'd you tell him we haven't
been studying together?
i didn't know you told him we were.
look, i...
i just can't have any more
hassles right now.
don't shut me out.
mmm.
let's go somewhere.
is your mom home?
she leaves for work
in about an hour.
i don't think
i can wait that long.
promise me you'll come over
this time.
i love you.
promise.
believe it.
( sniffling )
that is one hot
little piece of ass.
you shut up about her.
you hear me?
( grunting )
that's not how you talk to me.
( breathing heavily )
thanks.
you, too, willy.
you're welcome.
you'll make a terrific
virgin mary.
shut up.
( stammering )
who said i was a virgin?
i was talking about the play.
and being a virgin is bad
because... why?
'cause nobody else is.
there may be one or two.
and what play are you
talking about?
hello? the christmas play.
mary, baby jesus,
wise men.
you auditioned for it.
( laughs ) remember?
no one does that kind
of play anymore.
it's not politically correct.
( chuckles )
oh.
i ran across this
when i was cleaning.
wait.
sharon was in the band
with my mom and dad?
evidently. she was pregnant
and depressed.
her boyfriend left her.
she didn't want the baby.
the plan was for your mother
to watch after both kids
while sharon filled in
with the band.
how do you know all this?
your father asked me
to look over things
so i wouldn't throw out
anything important.
this seemed important.
and... kinda personal.
so i stopped reading.
thanks.
would you be willing
to do me a favor?
that depends.
there's a bunch of kids
down at the shelter
who don't know it's not politically
correct to have a christmas play.
they'd really like to have one,
and i could really
use a good acting coach.
i can't act. ( grunts )
huh.
i...
what makes you think that's mine?
( chuckles )
you see?
you can give
quite a performance.
so, i have no choice.
no.
but i think you'll like it.
it's three days a week,
and a half-day saturdays.
( sniffling )
come back to bed and hold me.
you could at least
help me with the bed.
you helped mess it up.
( sighs )
don't be mad, angel.
do you still love me, jason?
( sighs )
you're the only girl i dated
since the 7th grade.
you never say it.
uh...
you've been my lady
since i first saw you
at the halloween party
rolling around on the floor
in that stupid pumpkin costume.
( chuckles )
( sighs )
i'm pregnant.
you're kidding, right?
no.
i did the test.
three times.
what are you going to do?
we could get married in kentucky
on account of i'm pregnant.
kentucky?
are you out of your gourd?
we can't keep it.
what do you mean?
give me a break.
what do you want me to do?
what we always talked about.
you should've
been more careful.
"careful" works both ways.
what... what about all your talk
about us being together
forever?
i didn't mean like this week!
and besides, we have no money.
you can make good money
as a carpenter.
you're great at it.
angel, baby...
this... just isn't a good time
to get married.
you can see that, can't you?
( sighs )
all right,
i'll get the money for the abortion.
( sighs )
geez, all anybody ever
wants out of me is money.
that is not true!
i love you, jason.
( sighs )
this is our child. how can you
even think of destroying it?
well, you better think of it.
'cause i'm not
gonna be trapped by you
or anyone else.
don't say a word about this
to anyone.
jason!
now, not everybody
will have a speaking part.
but everyone will
have a very important role.
you all have special talents.
kevin doesn't. he's lame.
kevin, kevin, kevin, kevin.
kids, i'd like you all
to meet ms. lane.
children: hi, ms. lane.
are you lois lane,
superman's wife?
no, duck-brain.
superman's wife is old.
all right. kids,
i'll be right back.
everyone just
behave yourselves.
you're not scared of a few
second-graders?
no.
it's the sixth-graders
that i'm worried about.
look, if you're
having second thoughts,
this is the time to decide.
uh... you're the one
who asked me to do this.
and i think you'll
be great at it.
but that doesn't mean
you can quit if you go down
and change your mind later.
give me your word.
yeah. you have my word.
good.
the second chapter of luke
is the theme for the script
we're gonna need.
wait, you want me
to help write the script?
no.
i want you to write it.
oh, and by the way,
we need 17 speaking parts.
( whispering ) seventeen?
everyone that wants
to work on scenery,
come this way.
( cheering )
go, jason! whoo!
oh, no.
( cheering )
( indistinct cheering )
oh, buddy.
( sniffing )
( shouting in distance )
( shouting continues )
( shouting )
i warned you about that
superstar stuff, lane!
but coach, if hank had just been
there for me when i reached back,
none of this would've happened.
bullshit!
you started too soon.
and when hank was closing in
on you, you sped up,
crossed lanes,
disqualified the whole team.
this sport isn't all about you.
get it
i can change, coach.
i can.
show me.
( sighs )
( sighs )
( coughs )
( sighs )
( dance music playing )

( sighs )

to enjoy life.

with some of the guys.
i'm already running late. so...
( snaps fingers )
oh, by the way.

( chuckles )
mmm.

on a project together.

to a go green benefit tonight.
you'll be okay by yourself?
yeah. have a good time.
i like those shoes.
hmm.
( door squeaks )
( knocking )
wow.
look at this place.
how's the play coming?
do you own a dress coat?
yes.
why do you ask?
i couldn't find luke.
there's a table of contents
in the front of the book.
or you could just google it.
( sighs )
( grunts )
don't you look handsome?
so do you, honey.
i love that dress. thank you.
( clears throat )
can you believe that ashley
and i had a conversation today?
you did? oh, yeah.
about what?
well, she's working on, uh,
some new project,
and i encouraged her.
oh, baby. mm-hmm.
thank you. ooh ooh.
( giggling )
uh... watch out, now.
( laughs )
actually i should
be thanking you.
for what?
well, for the garden,
the bushes, the new flowers.
mm-hmm.
i can actually park the car
in the garage again.
who knew?
you're the best. mwah.
mm-hmm.
oh, do you have a 20?
here you go.
bill, you only have a 20.
nah, i've got a 20 and a 50.
mmm, no. look.
only a 20.
don't worry about it.
i-i'll go to the bank
tomorrow, okay?
grab an arm. fo' sho'.
here we go. ( chuckles )
( train horn blowing )
( grunts )
i just need some stuff.
and?
i, uh...
i brought... i brought money.
what's wrong?
huh?
wait! please, please, i'm sick.
( grunting )
( gasping )
( coughing )
please, please, please, guys.
( jason coughing )
please.
i'll do whatever you want!
i'm begging you, geo.
please.
please!
then you're working with roach.
ashley, you okay?
where'd you go the other night?
i gotta write a play.
did you just say,
"write a play"?
i gotta go.
it's just not as much fun
without you.
then go home for a change.
i'll talk to you tomorrow.
( softly ) okay.
¶
( no audible dialogue )
i've never read that before.
that's good.
you'll write
with a fresh perspective.
( toy squeaks )
( sighs ) i still don't know
how i'm gonna
get 17 parts out of it.
put yourself
in their positions.
what would you think?
yeah, but 17 parts?
when was the last time
you saw a bunch of people
get together and <i>not</i>
have a lot to say?
( toy squeaks )
all the time at my house.
( chuckles )
bring it back.
come here.
good boy.
( sighs ) good boy.
nick. what happened?
did ken do this?
i just went home
like you said.
my old man was drunk again.
i should've known better.
it's not your fault.
( sniffles ) you're safe now.
( crying ) let's get
you to a hospital.
no.
don't be afraid.
let me help you.
i'll... get a first aid kit.
let's get you inside.
trust me.
( sighs )
( sniffles )
okay, all right.
( sighs )
( grunts ) ( whimpers )
all right.
( sighs )
( groans )
( sighs )
( sighs )
( sighs )
why does he hate me?
he hates himself.
why does he do this to me?
he doesn't know love.
that makes him dangerous.
no shit.
he's a monster.
how do i make him stop?
you can't.
so i just let him
keep beating me?
i definitely
don't recommend that.
then what?
do you want things to change?
that's an insane question.
then you need to report this
to the police.
what he did was criminal.
he'll kill me.
look, i know you're scared.
it's a difficult decision.
i understand.
but it's one
you've got to make.
he won't stop.
ever consider leaving home?
only every day.
i'm 17.
i don't got a place to go.
i don't want to end up
sleeping on the streets.
you can stay with me.
it's the first place he'd look.
this is the number
for a friend of mine.
her father had a lot
in common with yours.
she can give you
a place to stay
right now, if you want it.
yeah, okay.
okay.
good.
and if you're up for riding a bike,
i'll take you there tonight.
( whimpers ) sorry.
it's gonna burn a little.
thank god you're home.
where else would i be?
<i>( voicemail beeps )</i>
it's me, nick.
where are you?
i've left tons
of messages and texts.
call me.
why won't you just tell me
where you took nicki?
i promise i won't tell anybody.
i gave her my word.
she's okay.
she'll be in touch
when she's ready.
okay, guys.
um, there are 17 parts
and we need some singers.
so, who can sing?
oh, mr. blackman?
i'm working on a play
down at the shelter,
and we need to find costumes
and props...
young lady, our department
is grossly underfunded
and understaffed.
we need those things ourselves.
i wasn't asking for things.
just advice.
well, i'm sorry
i can't help you.
mr. evans,
you've been told before
we cannot have that
horrible smell in here.
they're sanding
down in the shop.
and if you don't want your backdrop
covered in sawdust, i can't do it there.
yeah, well, you can't
do it here, either.
there's nowhere else.
maybe you'd rather i quit.
fine,
as long as you
return the paint and supplies
you were advanced
for your personal use.
good-bye.
( sighs )
do i know you?
you look familiar.
you don't.
are you always this friendly?
only when i've just been fired.
oh, let me give you a hand.
i'm ashley.
jonathan.
oh. ( chuckles )
thanks.
jonathan: i know it's a mess,
but can i give you a lift?
are you kidding?
it's a real car!
is it yours?
actually, it's a van.
it's not completely
paid for yet,
but it's more or less mine.
( van doors shut )
i'll get that for you. oh.
thank you.
( clicks tongue )
you're, um...
different.
i'll... take that
as a compliment.
so, you do, like, what?
stage painting?
um, well, you know,
blackman needed
some cheap labor,
and i needed some supplies
and a space to work.
course, now i
don't have either.
i have an idea.
i'll alert the media.
( chuckles )
( engine starts )
your line.
hey. hey.
uh, guys, do you mind helping me
out a little bit? yeah, yeah.
thank you.
( indistinct chattering )
uh, mac,
this is jonathan.
jonathan, this is the guy that
i was telling you about. hey.
don't tell me.
ashley offered you
a place to work
if you do a simple
backdrop for our play.
yeah.
uh, so are you in charge here?
allegedly.
i'm just a volunteer.
uh, what do you need?
( sighs )
an area that's off-limits
would be <i>really</i> helpful.
yeah. this way.
okay, good job, everybody.
i'll be right back.
memorize your lines.
ms. lane, kevin took my script
to the bathroom
and flushed it,
but it wouldn't go down.
we'll see about that.
jonathan?
would you mind going
to the little boys' room
and retrieving darlene's
script back, please?
( chuckles )
hey, um,
m-maybe after we're
finished today,
i could give you a ride home?
unless you have,
like, other plans
or something.
no!
i mean, yes.
i never have plans.
i-i mean i don't
have plans today.
i... that is...
plans to rehearse,
but nothing after that.
( sighs )
i'd love a ride.
okay.
( mouthing silently )
has jason left already?
i couldn't wake him.
he's still upstairs.
don't talk with your
mouth full.
have you seen my
diamond earrings?
you didn't borrow them
or anything, did you?
no, i haven't.
you've been looking nice
recently.
well, i have been...
i've been talking
to this guy, and...
ahh.
yeah, he's... oh, just a sec.
hello?
are you serious?
what?!
i needed those boards,
like, yesterday.
how else are we gonna motivate
these people to go green?
yes! motivation, okay?
what a concept.
( squeals )
where have you been, girl?
you haven't answered
any of my calls.
i've been worried.
i'm not living at home
anymore, so i just...
left my phone there.
where are you staying?
are you all right?
you look fabulous.
thanks.
you do, too. uh...
do you wanna
do something tonight?
i have to figure out how
to costume 17 kids
with no money.
wanna help?
no, i don't think so.
really gotten carried away
with this whole
volunteering thing, huh?
yeah, the kids love doing it.
it'll be fun.
besides, we need to talk.
not really.
just... at least not yet.
see you around, though.
okay.
i've... really missed you.
yeah, me too.
hit the showers, men.
hank.
yeah, coach?
what's up with lane?
where is he?
i... you'll have to ask him,
coach.
i'm asking you.
( knocking )
hi, princess.
hey.
what's up?
so, you know that junk
that mac has been
cleaning out of the garage?
can i have it?
why do you want it?
to sell.
you know that mack and i
have been working on this
christmas play.
mac is too old for you.
dad. give me some credit.
ew.
( chuckling ) okay.
ah, whatever you can make
off the stuff in the garage
is yours to keep.
something else?
well, i...
found this poster of your band
in the garage.
you guys used to rock.
you were hot.
( chuckling ) ashley.
how would you like to perform again?
i wouldn't.
dad, please?
( scoffs ) our play would
be so huge with music.
it's just so... <i>almost</i> now.
this production
needs to be big.
bill: you want me to sing?
and play keyboard.
hmm.
well, sharon and i
used to do duets.
that's the deal.
me and your mom,
'kay?
wow.
well, i...
i guess that could work.
okay, well, i gotta go.
i have a date.
i'd like to meet him.
this date.
so i, uh,
used to sneak
into people's back yards
and steal charcoal
from the barbeques
so i could draw my murals
on buildings and sidewalks.
i was just a kid.
wow.
your neighbors
must've loved you.
we were never
around long enough
for anyone to notice
one way or the other.
( chuckles )
but you didn't quit.
jonathan: there was one person
who said i had potential.
it was the cop that caught me.
made me whitewash the entire side
of the building i'd just finished.
( groans ) that sucks.
turns out the owner had rented it out
to a billboard company for big bucks.
that cop got me my first job.
priming building sides
for advertising.
i've had way worse
jobs, though.
a way to make money.
what made you keep at it?
( sighs )
would've been pretty hard
to stop me.
until recently,
i only lived
and breathed painting.
( grunts )
( knocking on door )
hey.
jason's not here.
it's nice to see you, too.
can i come in?
yeah, sure.
i need to have 17 costumes
made for my christmas play.
how much are you paying?
well, actually... nothing.
but it's for a good cause.
well, please?
we're practically family.
( chuckles ) i barely know you.
and your mother won't even
stay in the same room with me.
eh... <i>step-mother,</i>
and consider yourself lucky.
five minutes with her
and you're late for the door.
whatever. i still need
to earn some cash now.
um, we're having a garage
sale next week.
whatever we make,
over our expenses,
is yours.
please say you'll help.
i'm desperate.
okay, i'll tell you what.
if you'll help me
with these alterations,
that'll give me some time
to help you make costumes.
i can't sew.
i'll teach you.
otherwise, no deal.
but i don't have time
for anything else.
( chuckles )
welcome to my world.
well, if you really think old
"brainless" can help. ( sighs )
wow.
what do you think?
it's great.
so you wanna try it?
um, sure.
( softly ) i don't...
know what i'm doing.
( chuckles ) just try it.
okay. stick it in.
mm-hmm.
does it matter what this...
mm-mmm. is this...
we're worried
about the longer one.
¶ lift me up
oop.
yeah, just... i don't know.
okay. i don't know.
you almost had it. look...
¶ from the shallows.
¶ i am stumblin' a... ¶
¶ lonely grave
¶ lift me up
¶ from your shallows.
¶ i am destined to...
¶ live ashamed
got more clothes.
got some clothes for ya.
oh. okay, wait.
wait. before you put them down.
right there.
yeah. just dump 'em.
( sighs )
it's a little big.
( mutters )
¶ oh, i been sold out
( retching )
¶ by my best friend.
¶ i've been knocked down ¶
¶ and thrown away
( retching )
¶ oh oh i've been sold out ¶
¶ and mistreated.
¶ i've ignited ¶
¶ a dying flame
that looks good.
ready? okay.
you're my mannequin.
okay. fits really well...
obviously
for a smaller person...
have a good day. you, too.
peace out.
okay.
you know what?
( indistinct chattering )
have a good day.
thank you very much.
let it go for seven bucks.
what do you say?
ashley: nicki!
hey.
you changed your mind.
uh, we could really
use your help.
yeah.
( bill conversing indistinctly )
i'm just here to see what's
been keeping you so busy.
or should i say "who"?
i'm so over
spending time at bars,
and i'm glad you are, too.
this is much more fun.
yeah, spare me the pep talk.
i know you.
peace offering.
( gagging )
( whispers ) that's vodka.
yeah, i know. it's your fave.
i don't do that anymore.
look, neither you or my dad have
ever gone too long without a drink.
i never knew that you
thought i was like your dad.
i'm sorry. i don't.
look, it's been a bad week.
w-what's going on?
you've obviously
been too busy to care.
i care. you're my best friend!
but nicki, i'm finally
doing something that i like.
( stammers ) do it with me.
i don't belong here.
i don't belong anywhere.
that's not true.
i... i want you to meet someone.
you never used to argue
with me before.
look, go back to your friends.
like your biker buddy said,
i got a lot of heavy decisions
to make right now.
i'll see you later.
( sighs )
( indistinct chattering )
( sighs )
you've met ashley's
friend before?
maybe.
look, it was over
three years ago.
ashley know about that?
it's nobody else's
business but mine.
bill!
can i have a word with you?
all right.
( no audible dialogue )
( sighs )
all right.
you okay. come on.
it's okay.
( grunts )
it's all right.
it's all right.
she'll be all right.
she just shouldn't lift
anything with her condition.
jason will never speak to me
if he thinks i've told anyone.
this isn't the sort of thing
you can hide for very long.
what, you're...
you're having jason's baby?
what's you plans?
i'll go to school
until christmas break,
and then...
i don't know.
it's not the most complete
set of plans i've ever heard.
it needs work.
what does jason propose to do?
i don't know. okay, i know
jason can be a real...
weiner at times,
but deep down,
he really does care.
i don't think he
wants either of us.
he's changed so much.
man: hey, could i
get some help over here?
how long are those people
gonna be in our yard?
looks like a garage sale.
( bill chuckling )
oh, sharon.
baby, it is a garage sale.
well it makes us look poor.
what is this all about?
( sighs )
seeing you selling off
all of amanda's old things.
it's just... i...
i didn't think you'd
mind if we sold them.
( sighs ) oh, baby.
so nice to see you
and ashley getting along
since she's been doing the play.
( chuckles )
you must be very proud that she's
doing something creative, huh?
i am.
she's certainly
home a lot more.
mm-hmm.
i just wish jason were.
and i wish i knew
why our things
keep disappearing.
my jewelry,
money from our wallets.
and now my mother's silver.
yeah.
oh, baby.
( groans )
has it ever occurred to you
that it might be jason?
he's lost a lot of weight.
he does not look good.
bill, i'm tired.
could you just get rid
of those people soon?
you betcha. thanks.
hey, mac. hey.
let's wrap this up, huh?
you got it.
been a long day, huh?
yes, sir.
we did really well... so, we
have a few more things to sell.
( sighs )
show some mercy!
i'm beat.
we've made 247
and 63 cents.
that means we have enough
to buy the rest of the supplies
and pay me something.
maybe a little left over
for some paint and canvas?
ashley: you're just in it
for the paint.
yeah... and just for that,
i am not letting you take me
to pizza tonight. ( chuckles )
um, actually,
can i take a rain check?
something sorta came up.
what?
just some personal stuff.
okay. ( scoffs )
don't let me interfere, then.
don't be that way.
here, just take the keys
and get all the rest
of this... to shelter,
and i'll come by
and pick it up later, okay?
see you later.
bye.
you know what?
let's just do the shelter thing
another day.
you take the truck,
get some rest,
go home, and...
i'll call you later.
uh... ashley! tell me you
are not going to follow him.
don't worry.
i know what i'm doing.
i heard coach let you go.
sorry, buddy.
yeah, well you
could've covered for me.
i've been sick.
i tried to cover.
he didn't buy it.
everybody knows you
got a problem.
( grunting )
hey. you're my friend!
but you're whacked out, man.
you need help.
screw you.
( bell dinging )
hey.
hi.
nice shirt.
had these made for everyone
in the play.
long time, no see.
i didn't think you'd
even remember me.
i mean, it's been
over three years.
and that was a pretty
wild night.
and now you're
dating my best friend.
( chuckles )
small world.
yeah. thing is,
i didn't even know you two
knew each other.
is that a problem for you?
well, i mean, ashley's just
been so busy with the play,
and she's just beginning
to have confidence in herself,
and... and you?
and me?
and, well...
that subject just
hasn't come up yet.
you know me.
i'm not gonna say anything.
but...
she's bound to find out
sooner or later.
later would be better.
i'd just rather
tell her myself.
so this a real thing?
( chuckles )
looks like you've been taking
pretty good care of yourself.
had to.
yeah.
you had to do it alone.
i just couldn't handle
any relationships at the time.
but... i'm here for you now.
don't make any promises
you can't keep.
this is where i'm staying.
nobody knows but mac.
you're pretty great, nicole.
what's the matter, nick?
ken and the bar boys
not enough action for you?
you have to steal my boyfriend?
( chuckling )
this is too funny.
i know what this
must look like,
but it's...
( laughing )
i'm laughing.
jonathan: wha...
( grunts )
have a little faith in me.
i do. very little.
wanna reconsider that promise?

what are you doing in my room?
"sharon's had it so tough.
i'm going to take care
of jason until she's ready."
your mother never really
loved the band like i did.
but she loved me and bill.
we thought we were
doing what she wanted.
what are you talking about?
you're a lot like her.
you're both so pretty.
are you okay?
i watched you
sell amanda's things.
have you been stealing my things
and selling them, too?
honestly, sharon, i haven't.
no... why would i?
( sighs )
i don't know how
to be a good mother.
you're starting
to freak me out.
why doesn't my son like me?
i'm gonna go get daddy.
i've pushed bill away.
is he gonna leave me, too?
( sighs ) why don't you just...
give me the diary?
no!
no, no.
sharon!
what is going on?
( sighs )
hey, sorry to come by so late.
your mom's not home, right?
no, night shift again.
what's wrong?
everything. just take this...
most of it's yours, anyway.
okay, well, come in.
well, where's jonathan?
with my ex-best friend.
and sharon's freaking out
about something.
i don't know.
will you help me with this?
yeah.
( sighs )
men are pond scum. ( chuckles )
but... what are you gonna do?
( sighs )
honestly, i have no idea.
but i've talked to god
about it,
and i know that
he's forgiven me,
which is definitely
more than i can
say for my mom at the moment.
so you talk to god directly?
of course. don't you?
oh, yeah, all the time.
( sighs )
all i know is jason
needs to get off the drugs.
himself.
he has to decide.
have you decided
if you're gonna
keep the baby, or...
go to school?
both.
you can't be anything
if you haven't finished school.
w-what are you gonna
do when the baby comes?
well my mom won't kick me out,
and since she works nights,
she'll be able to watch
the baby during the day.
i'm gonna try to work
for a store doing alterations
so i can be with her at night.
i see you've
decided it's a girl.
( chuckles )
have you named her yet?
shut up. ( chuckles )
( knocking on door )
i'm popular tonight. ( sighs )
you must be the angel.
i'm a friend of jazz.
i know who you are,
and you're not welcome here.
who are you?! leave her alone!
( phone ringing )
angelina's mom
has already called the cops.
your brother's an idiot.
geo: i'm not.
whore's mom works nights.
that's when he gets
his free piece of ass.
ain't that right?
( breathing heavily )
jazz...
is a very disappointing boy.
but... you already knew that,
didn't you?
jason's too good for you.
( gasping )
( grunts )
let her go, geo.
( whimpering )
everybody's here.
nice.
i said, "let her go"!
( whimpering )
( groaning )
the money, jazz!
i don't have it.
search him.
( grunting )
i don't have it!
girl: what?!
( choking ) nothin'.
then this is our lucky night.
( angelina gasps )
( whimpering )
( clothing rips )
bitch!
( grunts )
( yells )
( gun cocks )
we're gonna try this again.
this time
i want a better answer.
the money is where?
( grunting )
it's outside.
under the doormat.
( yelps )
i-i brought it...
for the baby.
money.
you give that back! ( groans )
money.
geo: easy.
you're okay.
( groans )
( yells )
just chill.
( gasping )
( groans )
( sobbing )
( cries )
ah! ( sobbing )
the lord is my shepherd.
i shall not want.
he maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.
oh...
he leadeth me
beside still waters.
he restores my soul.
shut up with that religious shit.
yea, though i walk
though the valley of the shadow of death...
geo: get the money.
i will fear no evil, for you are...
( sobbing ) where's the money?
( gasps )
no.
( yells )
angelina:
thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me. ( sobbing )
o lord, please!
( cries ) ( grunts )
( geo screaming )
( angelina praying )
angelina: though the valley
of the shadow of death.
thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.
you prepareth a table
in the presence of my enemies.
stop!!!
he anointeth my head with oil.
get geo. let's get out of here.
surely goodness and...
and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life.
take it easy.
you don't wanna hurt anybody.
( siren blaring )
that everything?
pretty much.
okay.
then, um,
we're done with you for now.
in the morning, i'll need you
to come down, and, uh,
identify the accused.
officer,
do you think we could
have our costume money back?
the play is only
a few days away.
mmm, right now,
it's still evidence
confiscated at the scene
of the crime.
i have to have that money.
those kids are counting on me.
i-i gave them my word.
i'm sorry.
there's nothing i can do.
so what made you come tonight?
i needed to see you.
but when you weren't home, i
figured you were at angelina's.
after your date with nicole?
it wasn't a date.
i mean, i wish you would
just listen to me so i could...
( jason screaming )
let me go!
give him the sedative now.
let me go! let me go!
jason: <i>let me go!</i>
is jason gonna be all right?
the gunshot wounds
were superficial.
he had so many drugs
in his system
that he's actually doing better
now with the transfusions
we've given him.
can you help him?
i mean, with the addiction?
we can monitor and assist
with withdrawal now.
but ultimately,
whether he stays clean,
it's up to him. right.
h-how soon can he come home?
he could go to jail.
but i am recommending
that he sign himself
into a rehab center.
oh, thank you so much.
no, jason... jason... oh.
is not going to jail.
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
that's <i>our</i> son
lying back there.
and that's <i>our</i> daughter
that almost got shot.
god!
oh, my god. oh, baby.
oh, god. ( sobbing )
sharon.
( sobbing )
i haven't always
done what's right in the past.
i know that. but...
bill!
our whole world
is falling apart.
let me finish.
what i want to tell you, baby...
( sighs )
( crying )
nothing in our lives
has worked out
the way we wanted.
but believe it or not,
baby, i love you,
( whispers ) and i want
our family to work.
it's up to us
to work things out.
look at me.
( sighs )
( sobbing ) oh, oh, come here.
come here, baby.
( sobbing ) my girl.
who's my girl?
i am.
i really enjoyed practicing
with you the other day.
( chuckles )
me too.
more than you know.
( sighs )
( whispers ) i love you.
i love you, too.
( gasps )
i'm caught.
i'm caught. stand still.
stand still.
you're making it worse.
stand still.
get it loose, bill!
baby, you're gonna make it...
get it loose!
why'd you come
get me anyway, huh?
friends don't let friends
drive drunk.
sharon: you can be a real
pain in the butt sometimes.
but i love you, girl.
( groans )
i love you... ( mutters )
okay, sharon...
oh, oh, it's caught!
( yelling )
wait, sharon...
sharon: amanda, look out!
( horn honking )
( screaming )
calm down.
i'm here.
( sobbing ) oh, baby.
what is the matter?
( sobbing )
( whispers )
what is the matter?
i was just trying to hug her.
( sniffles )
all my fault.
it was all my fault. no.
it was an accident.
i forgive you.
you've got to forgive yourself.
( whimpers )
okay?
i can't.
i loved her so much.
oh, baby.
we both did.
but that was another life.
you're not leaving? now?
what about me?
you're off to a good start.
i lost the money for the play,
my best friend and my boyfriend
are cheating on me,
and angelina and jason
are in the hospital.
( chuckles )
and now you're leaving.
see you at the shelter.
won't be the same.
nothing ever is.
but you've got 17 kids
counting on you.
( sighs )
i'm gonna go
see angelina right now.
i'll catch up with you later.
mac?
will you check on jason for me?
um, make sure that he's okay?
if he needs anything.
i'll do better than that.
( chuckles )
you think visiting hours
apply to chairs?
where'd you get that?
from your friends
down at the shop.
it's a piece of trash.
no. like you,
it's a real piece of work.
and, like you,
it's just not finished yet.
although, it looks considerably
better than you at the moment.
you think they'll
let me work on it?
at the rehab center?
sure. they're...
bound to need better chairs
down there.
so what's next?
none of your business.
who are you, anyway?
a friend of angelina's.
how is she?
nobody tells me anything
around here.
they treat me like a criminal.
( chuckles )
what's so funny?
you <i>are</i> a criminal.
i did it for angel.
so she could keep the baby.
they didn't tell you?
she lost the baby.
she said you didn't want it.
look, uh...
thanks for the rocker.
( sighs )
just, please...
just leave me alone.
this is between angel and me.
we'll work it out.
maybe.
maybe not.
she hasn't
regained consciousness yet.
the doctors don't
expect her to make it.
( sighs )
please! wait, wait, wait.
wait.
just please...
just help me.
help you do what?
just gotta see angel.
and please just
talk to somebody.
if you're really her friend,
you know she'll want me
to be there.
she's all alone.
just please let me see her.
she doesn't
need your guilt right now.
she needs your love,
your faith,
and your prayers.
look...
i know that i am not
worth her little finger...
but she's the only person
that i really loved.
( gasps )
she always wanted me
to say that to her,
but i never did.
i'll see what i can do.
you know you can make a difference
if you're willing to change.
the greatest man in the universe
was a simple carpenter.
and his life...
changed this planet.
( sighs )
( door shuts )
another volunteer.
( sighs )
hi, i'm nicki.
watch the sticky fingers.
i got a heavy date tonight.
what is this <i>sack</i>
you are wearing?
i'm mary, the virgin.
and this is my costume.
well, no wonder.
you're never gonna
get a guy looking like that.
hey, makeovers are what i do.
come on.
( sighs )
i'd prefer you
didn't bring her here.
has anyone ever told you how
extremely irritating you can be?
( sighs ) it wasn't a date!
in two weeks, nicole
is going to have to testify
against her own father
in court.
what does that
have to do with you?
my mom left us
when i was a kid.
my dad turned into a lush.
i used to go by the bars after
school to help work off his bill.
nicole used to come by
and pick up her old man.
he was usually passed out
in a corner somewhere.
it was kind of
a regular routine.
we never really talked much.
well,
one day, my old man
started a fight.
i tried stopping him
and ended up getting hammered
between him and nicole's dad.
bartender called the police,
and all of us
were hauled off to jail.
nicole and i
were given a choice.
could go back home,
or we could press charges
and have to live as a ward
of the state.
nicole was younger,
so she went back home.
i left and... ( chuckles )
i never looked back
when i was old enough,
i left the state home,
and i've been
supporting myself ever since.
her dad turned
into a mean drunk.
she's been living
on his unemployment,
getting meals from guys,
shoplifting, whatever.
well if it was that bad
for nicole,
then why did she
take me to bars?
it's what she knows.
it was way better than staying
at home with her old man.
can you help her?
be easier if...
she had a few friends around.
( sighs )
i will be.
sorry.
( footsteps )
look, am i gonna have to fix
all these costumes by myself?
i mean, look at them.
without me, you would
have <i>no</i> fashion sense.
zip. nada.
i mean, really?
come on... oh... okay.
i get it.
do you think you could help
with makeup, too?
duh.
and can we get, like,
little halos or something?
i mean, you can't really
be an angel without them.
don't see why not.
just give me tin foil
and <i>lots</i> of glitter.
( grunting )
i'll be right outside.
( ventilator pumping )
( gasping )
i'm so sorry, angel.
( sniffles )
i know... i know
i screwed up big-time.
yeah.
yeah.
( sighs )
( sobbing )
you never did anything
in your entire life
to deserve this.
i-i love you so much, baby.
( sobs ) i'd give anything...
anything to have things
back the way they were.
i would.
( sniffles )
( gasps ) angel's god...
( sniffles )
i need to talk to you.
i need to talk to you.
( sniffles )
she would...
she would always talk to you
like you were her friend.
she told me that
she prayed for me.
it...
it must've worked
because i'm still here, right?
( sobs )
i never prayed for her.
never.
and i know that's wrong...
on account that
she's in real trouble now,
and it's all my fault.
( sobs ) she told me that...
that jesus...
( sniffles )
jesus went to hell for me...
to pay for what i did.
( voice breaking ) to pay for...
to pay for what i did.
he must've been
tough as shit, because...
i can't handle
this hell i'm in.
i understand that, uh...
that you rose yourself
from the dead.
i get it.
i believe it. i do.
i believe it.
believe it.
so it's not like...
it's not like it's a big deal for you
to get her out of this coma, right?
right?
( sniffles )
i know...
i know that i fucked up.
she told me
that you forgive everybody.
even shits like me.
if you can...
if you can do anything,
anything with my life...
you can have it.
just, please,
please,
don't let angel die.
don't let her die on me.
( sobbing ) she's my best friend.
i'm so sorry.
i love you, baby.
i love you.
thank you. all right.
that's for the animals.
slow down.
you're going too fast.
can i please have all my angels
on the steps over here?
i forgot what i'm
supposed to say.
just remember
why you need the room,
and you'll say the right thing.
hey, nicole,
where's that glittery
star you made?
i mean, i've got a rig
and a slot, but no star.
shepherds, pay attention.
when watching
over your flock at night,
do not... repeat, do not
step on the electrical cords.
okay, here we go. and a five, six,
seven, eight. ( plays chord )
girl: hey, you didn't say, "and
a one, and a two, and a three."
all right, i'll give you
a one and a two.
kevin, stop
picking your nose, buddy.
( piano playing )
who's there?
what do you want?
fear not. you're extremely
flavored of the lord.
what's that mean?
god loves you,
and he picked <i>you</i>
to be the mother of his kid.
you know, the son of god.
uh-uh! i'm a virgin.
uh-huh. so what do i do?
nothing. god will
take care of everything,
including talking to joseph
about it.
okay. if you say so.
hey, joe, wake up.
mary's with child. say what?
she's pregnant.
i didn't <i>do</i> anything.
we know, we know.
she really is a virgin.
what do you want <i>meto do?</i>
first, marry her.
but don't touch her.
then, name the baby jesus.
anything else?
yeah, take good care of them.
i'll be bringing
more instructions later.
kevin: <i>caesar was disgusted and
sent everyone home to be taxed.</i>
my wife's having a baby.
let me it. child: <i>no!</i>
you're supposed to say,
"there's no room at the inn!"
<i>i said "no," didn't i?</i>
what do we do?
<i>you can sleep in the barn if you want.
</i> thanks.
( piano playing )
the star stopped.
look! there's the castle
over there.
well, the lights are on.
so they must still be up.
boy: hi, we're very wise men.
<i>and</i> wise woman. i'm horrid.
we've been following his star
for a very long time.
then you must be hungry.
come enjoy some twinkies
while i check it out
with my wise guys.
( audience laughing )
my boys say <i>if</i> it's true,
he's supposed to be born
in bethlehem.
boy: where's that?
not too far from here.
i'll show you on my g.p.s.
thanks.
just a minute.
you owe me now.
so when you find out
where he is, you let me know.
do <i>you</i> want
to worship him, too?
yeah. me and the boys
are gonna pay him
a little visit.
( piano plays )
( audience laughing )
hey, how your sheep doing?
they're okay.
but i'm bored.
nothing <i>ever</i> happens
in bethlehem.
when i'm old enough,
i'm going to jerusalem,
be a tax collector.
they make <i>big</i> money. <i>¶ angels
we have heard on high ¶</i>
hark! herald angels
are singing!
<i>¶ sweetly singing</i>
<i>o'er the plains ¶</i>
¶ gloria
<i>¶ in excelsis</i>
¶ deo ¶
fear not.
behold, i bring you
good tidings
of great joy which shall be
to all people.
which means?
good news for everybody.
unto you is born,
this day, in the city of david,
a savior,
which is christ the lord.
this shall be a sign to you:
you shall find a babe
wrapped in swaddling clothes,
lying in a manger.
what are swaddling clothes?
kevin: pampers, dummy.
let's check it out.
what about our sheep?
bring 'em with.
( girl mutters )
glory to god in the highest.
and on earth, peace.
goodwill to all men.
