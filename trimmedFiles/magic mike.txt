...they think they're owed a lot more
than, uh, they deserve. so too bad. bummer.
uh, but, uh, you know, whatever. sucks.
l just don't have to be the guy
that tells them, uh, you know...
...that they're, uh, not going to be able
to rebuild their houses. um, anyway....

l'm sick of talking about medicaid...
...and processing insurance forms as well.

paul: right.
-l get it.
right. l mean, it's slightly different
when you're doing medicaid claims...

uh, well, he must be fucking drunk
because l don't cook no fucking breakfast.
l wasn't talking about you cooking it.
he just said you like breakfast food.
we were going to swing by lhop
on the way--
okay uh, good talk.
um, l'll be outside with the rest
of the breakfast lovers of the world.
[chuckles]
all right, kid.
dallas:
virgin dance the other night. no more.
you only have a cherry pop one time.
now look, you walked out on-stage,
you looked like shit, all right?
when l saw something
is when you got off-stage.
pulled a one-on-one with that chick.
l'll show you what you're gonna do.
now, let's go to the basics.
take your clothes off.
-right now?
-right now. take them off.
every fucking one of them. let's go.
let's go. take them off.
-heh.
-hang on. what the fuck are you doing?
heh, what are you, a 12-year-old
in the locker room?
no.
-then what are you doing?
-heh, taking off my clothes.
you're taking off your clothes
like a 12-year-old.
but you're not a 12-year-old
in the locker room. you are the man.
on the stage. thousands of women.
eyes on you. you are their vision.
so, what do you do?
you don't just fucking throw your clothes off.
you fucking make it count, baby.
you walk out. you own it.
you look around. you tease.
you seduce.
clock eyes,
but don't lock in on any of them.
you got to believe that you are inside
every single one of them.
and when the time's right,
then you'll know it.
foom!
stick it. that right there
is like hitting the g-spot, every single time.
now get up there, move around.
you see, baby, you're not just stripping.
you are fulfilling every woman's
wildest fantasies. all right?
you are the husband that they never had.
you are that dreamboat guy
that never came along.
you are the one-night stand,
that free fling of a fuck...
...they get to have, tonight, with you on-stage,
still go home to their hubby...
...and not get in trouble...
...because you, baby, you made it legal.
you are the liberation.
own it. who's got the cock?
you do, they don't.
get right here. move slow. around.
fucking concentrate.
round, round, round.
make this shit count.
ain't time for a fucking fag joke
in here, boy. l'm talking about money.
move around, round, round.
get the movements. breathe.
all right. easy, rattlesnake.
on three, you're going to stick it.
one, two, three, stick.
that's the hook, baby.
that's the fucking hook.
that's what l'm talking about.
all right?
[adam exhales]
you can do this, because l know you can.
-l can do it.
-now, take a breath.
[adam exhales]
fuck that mirror like you mean it.
mlke:
"all right, all right, all right.

on the main stage." hi, beatrice.

on getting you suited up. you ready?

mlke:

adam: see my sister? what do you mean?
-yeah.

yeah, she was there during your act.
you talked to my sister?
l talked to your sister as you were
dry-humping a girl, yes.
my sister saw me dance?
heh, yeah, we were actually laughing.
l had a pretty good laugh about it.
-oh, heh, wow. fuck.
-ha, ha.
she did not look happy.
did you tell her to come?
l told her. l didn't think she'd fucking come.
jeez.
well, she did. l don't know how long
she stayed for, but it was, uh....
-she, ha, ha, looked pissed.
-ha, ha, oof.

-how much money?

mlke:

my sister got it for me, ha, ha

um, tsk, sba, yes, uh....
name and social.
absolutely. michael lane.
...brought the funds
for my down payment.
-yes. yeah, heh.
-heh.
okay.
all right.
we seem to have a credit issue, mr. lane.
your score is--
right. l, uh, actually...
-...heh, l talked to mr. rodriguez last week.
-oh.
as l was explaining to him, the businesses
that l manage deal exclusively in cash.
he said you would forego the credit check
if l brought in a healthy down payment.
lt should be noted in there.
he said he was going to put it in.
absolutely.
um, you are currently the manager
of an automotive accessories business?
mm-hm, absolutely. and an event-management
company, a roofing firm, heh.
honestly, the list goes on.
-wow, you're a busy guy.
-ha, ha. yeah.
lucky to be.
so, what kind of rates am l looking at?
there are ways to clear these credit issues
up over time, but--
oh, my god, l haven't even told you, heh,
what l'm here for. l really apologize.
this is what l do.
right here.
michael lane custom furniture concepts.
lt's competitive pricing. low overhead.
l mean, really, who wants to buy
that crap when it falls apart in a year...
...when you can get hand-crafted furniture
for a bargain?
-you know what l mean?
-yeah.
unfortunately, mr. lane,
my hands are tied.
the company has a policy
that we cannot issue loans...
...to clients who score below
our credit threshold.
l can absolutely understand
where you're coming from.
uh, you know, you hit buttons and you think
that you know something about me.
l get it. that's okay. lt's okay.
all, uh, l'm asking for is a good deal.
please, can you help me with that?
l mean, we do offer relief programs...
...for our qualified distressed clients,
so that--
l'm sorry. what?
lt's a relief program, so--
distressed? l'm distressed?
woman: no. no, not like that.
-heh.
sweetheart, listen. lt's okay. lt's fine.
does this look distressed?
l don't think so, one.
two, l read the papers, okay?
the only thing's that distressed is y'all.

lt's crazy.
yeah. uh, so l know, uh, joanna from the club.
uh, she came up--
she studied psychology
and she came up to do, uh....
what's the thing you
came up to do?
behavior analysis.
right. she was analysizing our behavior,
apparently.
that must have been, uh,
really enlightening.
lt actually was. you know, l go a few times
a week, if you want to come with us.
she is actually the kid's brother.
l mean, sister.
-yeah, heh. ha, ha.
-right. ahem.
-ls that a tattoo over there too?
-yeah.
she has tattoos. you want a drink?
-yeah, yeah.
-yeah?
-lt was nice to meet you.
-lt was nice to meet you too.
she's cute. what? l don't normally like
blonds, but she's really cute.
yeah, but she's not really our type.
you know what l'm saying?
you're not into her?
no, that's not what l'm saying.
l'm saying she's a little uptight.
we're fucking her,
not taking her to dinner.
lt's not gonna happen.
-she's a dinner type, is what l'm trying to say.
-oh.
okay, if you decide you want to share...
...and change your mind and put some
effort into it, you know my number.
besides, you know how much l love to eat.
yes, l will.
obviously you don't like head.
[all chatterlng]
l started cheating in the seventh grade
just to entertain myself.
finished high school, but if l could do it
all over again...
...l wouldn't have even gone. no way.
brooke:
you don't believe in school at all?
l think fuck school altogether.
when l have a kid,
l'm going to set him in front of the tv...
...and make him watch mad money all day.
teach him about the stock market.
get him into ameritrade
and shit like that.
l guarantee you by the time he's 1 8,
that little fucker's gonna be flush in cash.
rlchle: boo-yah!
-heh.
-l don't know why more people don't do that...
dallas: hm?
...just from an investment standpoint.
that's the state of the country, man.
america. people. stupid.
l hope l get to meet your kids someday.
dallas:
tsk, oh, no problem.
come visit anytime
in one of our three cool houses, dear.
[chuckles]
mlke: hey, if you want, l could probably
get dallas' number for you.
he's starting
this new life-coaching business...
[brooke laughlng]
...that l really do think you might benefit
from personally.
l mean, l saw the connection
between the two of you.
what? l'm sorry.
right? so you felt it too?
what? just, what?
what would his kids even look like?
they'd be running around
in little rattlesnake diapers and shit.
oh, no. oh, no.
look, don't, uh, they just say stupid shit
sometimes. don't let them bother you.
oh, no, it didn't bother me.
l'm just trying to wrap my mind
around adam and this whole mess.
l get it. l don't know how
l fit into this whole mix, either.
no. you-- when you're on-stage,
it all makes sense.
l mean, the way you dance
and the way the women respond to you....
wait a minute. so that means
someone might have stuck around.
that's good to know.
yeah.
that feeling.... that must be a really
crazy feeling to be on-stage...
...like that. l see why you've been doing it
for so long. l get it.
-but adam's different. he's....
-why is that?
well, he had a football scholarship.
a year ago, he basically ruined it
by getting...
...in a fistfight with his coach
in the first hour of the first day.
-yeah. l think he said something about that.
-yeah.
so l just don't--
l'm just trying to figure out...
...why he's stripping.
-"why" is easy.
-what do you mean, it's easy?
-you want some stripper wisdom?
-okay.
-you ready?
-yeah.
he's 1 9 years old.
lt's women, money and a good time.
l guess. l guess.
l got him.
okay?
okay.
-you gonna come to the show tonight?
-no.
-you're gonna come.
-no.
-you just said you liked the show.
-doesn't mean l'm gonna go again.
-but you said--
-l'm not, heh, going. l've seen it.
