territory of nebraska
come on girls!
hello, bob.
afternoon, miss cuddy.
c'mon inside. i got supper ready.
the pie is made out of peaches...
from a can!
they had four of those cans.
i don't know who got the other three.
i don't know who could afford em!
it's good pie.
if it pleases you, we might
have a postprandial recital.
say what?
a bit of music.
i like music.
# on the distant prairie where...#
# they had a while #
# in its quiet beauty lives and smiles #
# stands a little cottage and a creeping whine #
# loves around his porch to twine #
# in that peaceful dwelling was a lovely child #
# with her blue eyes beaming soft and mild #
# and the weaving wing lets of her flaxen hair #
# floating in the summer air #
# fair as a lily, joyous and free #
# light of that prairie, home was she #
# everyone who knew her felt the gentle prowl #
# rosalie "the prairie" round #
that sure was pretty singing, miss cuddy.
i got some cheese.
cheese?
yes ma'am. you know i've a few sheep out.
i know.
i made some cheese outta their milk.
wonder if you'd like to have some?
i got some here in my pocket.
cheese would be a fine finish to our
fried chicken dinner and peach pie...
this evening.
well then,
here it is.
this is fine cheese,bob.
so why not marry?
do what?
why not throw in together.
lands, animals and women's lives...
the whole bowl of wax!
we could use my capital and know
how to improve your claimant mine.
and if the union produces children,
then so much the better.
look that from any angle,
it works.
so why not marry?
i reckon, i go back east to find me a wife.
please, mr.giffen.
i won't take no for an answer.
miss cuddy...
i appreciate the offer and supper...
and concert and all...
but i cannot marry you.
will not.
won't.
i ain't perfect...
but you are too bossy...
and plum damn plain.
ain't no medicine for it.
this one's here is breathing a little bit momma.
mother is dead!
she is dead.
i'll take care of it.
no! we must bury her properly!
i'll prepare.
she will smell soon.
no!
you wanted her to die!
you hated her.
you hate me.
i hate you!
you can't leave mom outside!
you can't leave mom outside!
stop!
you can't leave mom outside!
the freezing...
cold...
father!
oh my jesus!
do what do i owe this pleasure, reverend?
springtime miss cuddy!
are clydene and kids getting along alright?
meaner never gone by the minute.
put your mule up and come
on inside the house.
there has been some trouble
amongst the women hereabouts.
i've heard about it.
it's bad.
guess what i'm ordering?
i couldn't...
a melodeon.
you are not!
yeap
i don't trust shipping a piano, so...
soon as i get in the loop, i'm going
to order a mason and hamlin melodeon.
you'll have the only melodeon in the territory.
back home, i used to play the piano by the hour.
i cannot live without real music much longer.
i could help you with them dishes.
i don't want any help with the dishes. 
so, how you getting along that giffen boy?
he uses my mules when i don't need them.
he helps me with my corn.
we planted some potatoes together
and we keep the fences up.
how you getting along?
when my bulls have finished their work here,
i let him turn it turn up on his heifers.
well...
seems like you are getting
together along alright.
feed him a meal every now and then...
like you do me.
you're a good citizen, mary bee
the bed up on the loft has
for a sleigh and i.
take the slop out to the hogs
before you go to sleep.
you're gonna give me a son.
you're gonna give me a son.
hell no!
this here is a goddamn free country, dowd!
can't nobody make me do it.
thou shalt not take the lord's
name in vain, vester.
specially not in his own house.
no i won't go. i can't.
why not?
in the name of our savior, vester.
i ask you, why not?
i can't take no time away from my crops
and i got the girls to look after...
and i can't afford to pay for no wagon.
i ain't in on this deal.
then what are we gonna do about theoline?
pitch a hole out on the dowd house.
you are a poor specimen of a man,
vester belknap!
i came here for the drawing.
me too.
let's get it over with.
what about vester?
i will draw for vester.
what do you mean?
i said i'll draw for him.
what did she say?
i said i'll draw for vester belknap.
can we proceed?
this is a painful occasion for you and
your families and i grieve for you.
your wives are fine and godly women.
but life gave them more than they could bear.
now we'll draw lots.
whoever draws the black bean
will draw the women home
to where they come from.
shall we defer the lady?
i will draw the last.
i'll go first.
keep your hands closed until
everybody has drawn.
thor.
miss cuddy.
put your hands in the circle here.
on the count of three...one...
felt bean in my hand is black. i dunno...
two.
three.
does that mean vester has to go?
he said he wouldn't.
he has to, he is one of us.
i baptized him.
i don't trust vester.
me neither.
it's true, reverend.
vester is a brute with no conscience.
i'll go.
you can't.
yes i will.
a woman?
i can ride as well as anybody.
i can handle a team and shoot.
you all know that.
and i can cook and care for...
those women better than any of you can.
oh! she's right.
she sure as hell right!
that's my connie, miss cuddy.
you tell us what you need
and we'll see to it.
when will you leave?
as soon as i can.
today is may 5.
she could be back in time to
celebrate 4 of july with us.
reverend dowd, we cannot allow this.
it is not a lone woman's place to
draw a wagon across this country.
much less when it carries three of
the lord's least capable children.
so why not come with me come, miss linens?
we can do it together.
you too, miss polhemus.
better still.
not. you husbands and family to care for.
you should.
but i do not. i live uncommonly, alone.
enough!
please. be seated.
i'm afraid y'all are right about mr.belknap.
he is untrustworthy. with the
task of this gravity...
and we need a homesman.
we will do everything we can to equip and...
accommodate for this journey, miss cuddy.
if you gentlemen will excuse me for a minute.
come look after your wagon?
i did.
my lord...what is that?
it's train wagon. trade for it last year.
since then been sitting out here in the snow.
when svendsen and sours came
around here for a wagon,
i gave a hell of a deal on it.
i give it to him!
i cut the windows, a bit bigger...
greased it pretty good.
set some new spokes and fellows.
that's the just the right
thing for them women.
i put a sliding bolt on the door.
what for?
lock them ladies in.
why would i do that?
stop and think about it.
what's that?
you might wanna tie something down...
put up ten of 'em.
oh my!
i'm not sure i'm ready.
are you scared?
a little...listen here, mary bee...
you got a passable rig...
mules.
and you're as good a man
as any man here abouts.
and you're doing a hell of a fine thing..
so go ahead on...
get to it...
and do it.
does everybody know?
yeap.
what are they say?
don't say nothing.
people don't like to talk death and taxes
only when comes to crazy...
they stay hushed up.
miss cuddy!
mary bee!
mary bee! 
i tried to catch you in town,
but you was already gone.
what do you want, reverend?
to give you these. letters to
the women's closest kin...
around hebron, iowa and going back east.
your journey will be long,
difficult and dangerous.
i expect it will.
god bless you woman.
rest will keep you. you know i believe
in you, don't you? you truly do.
i know it.
i go in your place, if i could.
now let us pray.
heavenly father, look down upon my daughter.
bless her in this undertaking.
grant her thy strength and
guide her with thy grace. .
she may carry home these poor souls.
we beg of thee.
in the name of jesus christ,
thy only begotten son
who gave his life
for the sins of man.
amen.
come on out outta there! you clay-job...
son of a bitch!
cmon down in here,
and you'll be a sad bastard long to live. 
and that won't be there long.
then you'll about understand, you baffle!

don't want to see crazy people.
you gonna meet traders
who will surely rape you...
and you gonna meet the indians,
who will kill you and then rape you.
after they kill me, no!

and if you think on it,
i'm sure you will see the wisdom in it.
after you have turned
them over to mrs carter...
why don't we marry and come back together.
i'm 31 years old and if i'll
ever marry, it better be soon. 
you are not getting any younger.
you see my house, my stock...
i've cut two fine claims
and money in the bank...
i am in good health and
capable of child bearing.
i plan to buy shoats next spring
and fattens them on corn...
and come next april... 
i'll have 60 acres into wheat.
i plan to put in pumpkins too.
we make a good team you and i.
if we pull together, we are bound
to prosper. do you agree?
i'm no farmer.
well you could try...
you could try.
i've tried it one time,
when we were...
north of wamego.
cutting 'em god dammed rows,
daylight to dark.
these prettier to look at
than ass end of an ox.
one morning i just rode off.
you deserted her.
when i left her, i was sorry.
but i never did look back.
i see.
so you won't marry me?
no.
i won't.
i know, i am plain as an old tin pail...
but would you think about it from here to
hebron and talk to me about it again?
talks cheap.
mr.briggs
perhaps you don't realize what a
grand thing you are doing taking....
these poor helpless women home.
if you don't, i assure you the
good lord does and i do.
might be the most fine generous act of your life.
it might be $300.
you won't marry me?
no
then i am plain...
i wish you say one kind word to me.
like what?
that i'm a good woman...
i helped you.
fair enough. you are a damn good woman
and you helped me.
i deserted from the dragoons.
that's right, company c 1st u.s
fort kearney. stole a horse and way i run.
ain't attached to nothing.
just me.
no
i want
to lay with you.
no
you must.
i saved your life.
well...
please,
spare me my dignity, sir.
raise your knees.
take me in your hand.
just remember cuddy, i didn't force you.
i will.
if it hurt you, you can't help it.
i know.
you asked me. i didn't ask you.
i know.
so let me in you.

hadn't been for you, mary bee wouldn't be dead.
she wouldn't leave me out here!
if you hadn't going crazy,
she wouldn't have made this trip
if you had stayed steady and
strong, she did be alive...
and at her home. in her own house.
and so would you, but no.
you went crazy and drove her crazy. that
killed her. you do you gotta say about that?
well i'll be...

come along and attend to you.
