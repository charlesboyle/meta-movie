i feel like you're driving
me to a court-martial.
this is crazy.
what did i do?
i feel like you're going
to pull over and snuff me.
what, you're not allowed
to talk? hey, forrest!
we can talk, sir.
oh, i see.
so it's personal?
no, you intimidate them.
good god, you're a woman.
i honestly...
i couldn't have called that.
i mean, i'd apologize, but isn't
that what we're going for here?
i thought of you as
a soldier first.
i'm an airman.
you have, actually, excellent
bone structure, there.
i'm kind of having a hard
time not looking at you now.
is that weird?
come on, it's okay, laugh.
sir, i have a question to ask.
yes, please.
<i>is it true you went 12 for 12 with
last year's maxim cover models?</i>
that is an excellent question.
yes and no.
march and i had a
scheduling conflict,
but fortunately, the
christmas cover was twins.
anything else? you're kidding
me with the hand up, right?
is it cool if i take
a picture with you?
yes.
it's very cool.
all right.
i don't want to see this
on your myspace page.
please, no gang signs.
no, throw it up.
i'm kidding.
yeah, peace.
i love peace.
i'd be out of a
job with peace.
come on. hurry up.
just click it. don't change any settings.
(all screaming)
- what's going on?
- woman: contact left!
what have we got?
(guns firing)
jimmy, stay with stark!
- stay down!
- yeah.
(groaning)
son of a bitch!
wait, wait, wait!
give me a gun!
stay here!
(groaning)
(powering up)
whoa!
(man speaking in urdu)
narrator: <i>tony stark.</i>
<i>visionary. genius.</i>
<i>american patriot.</i>
<i>even from an early age,</i>
<i>the son of legendary weapons
developer howard stark</i>
<i>quickly stole the spotlight with
his brilliant and unique mind.</i>
<i>at age four, he built his
first circuit board.</i>
<i>at age six, his first engine.</i>
<i>and at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from mit.</i>
<i>then, the passing of a titan.</i>
<i>howard stark's lifelong friend
and ally, obadiah stane,</i>
<i>steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,</i>
<i>until, at age 21, the
prodigal son returns</i>
<i>and is anointed the new
ceo of stark industries.</i>
<i>with the keys to the kingdom,</i>
<i>tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,</i>
<i>creating smarter weapons, advanced
robotics, satellite targeting.</i>
<i>today, tony stark has changed the
face of the weapons industry</i>
<i>by ensuring freedom and
protecting america</i>
<i>and her interests
around the globe.</i>
<i>as liaison to
stark industries,</i>
<i>i've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.</i>
<i>he is my friend and he
is my great mentor.</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor</i>
<i>to present this year's apogee
award to mr. tony stark.</i>
<i>tony?</i>
- thank you, colonel.
- thanks for the save.
<i>this is beautiful. thank you.
thank you all very much.</i>
<i>this is wonderful.</i>
<i>well, i'm not tony stark.</i>
(all laughing)
<i>but if i were tony, i would
tell you how honored i feel</i>
<i>and what a joy it is to receive
this very prestigious award.</i>
<i>tony, you know...</i>
<i>the best thing about tony
is also the worst thing.</i>
<i>he's always working.</i>
(all whooping) work it!
come on!
we should just stay
till the morning.
you are unbelievable.
oh, no!
did they rope you into this?
nobody roped me into anything!
- i'm so sorry.
- but they told me that
if i presented you with an
award, you'd be deeply honored.
of course i'd be deeply honored.
and it's you, that's great.
- so when do we do it?
- it's right here.
- here you go.
- there it is. that was easy.
- i'm so sorry.
- yeah, it's okay.
wow! would you look at that?
that's something else.
i don't have any of
those floating around.
we're gonna let it ride!
give me a hand, will you?
give me a little something-something.
okay, you, too.
- i don't blow on a man's dice.
- come on, honey bear.
there it is.
lieutenant colonel rhodes rolls! and...
dealer: two craps. line away.
that's what happens.
worse things have happened.
i think we're gonna be fine.
color me up, william.
- this is where i exit.
- all right.
tomorrow, don't be late.
- yeah, you can count on it.
- i'm serious!
i know, i know.
render unto caesar that which is caesar's.
there you go.
mr. stark!
excuse me, mr. stark!
<i>christine everhart,
vanity fair magazine.</i>
can i ask you a
couple of questions?
- she's cute.
- she's all right?
- hi.
- hi.
- yeah. okay, go.
- it's okay?
you've been called the
da vinci of our time.
- what do you say to that?
- absolutely ridiculous. i don't paint.
and what do you say to
your other nickname?
"the merchant of death"?
that's not bad.
let me guess.
berkeley?
brown, actually.
well, ms. brown,
it's an imperfect world, but
it's the only one we've got.
i guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,
i'll start making bricks and
beams for baby hospitals.
rehearse that much?
every night in front of the
mirror before bedtime.
i can see that.
i'd like to show
you first-hand.
all i want is a
serious answer.
okay, here's serious.
my old man had a philosophy,
"peace means having a bigger
stick than the other guy."
that's a great line coming from
the guy selling the sticks.
my father helped
defeat the nazis.
he worked on the
manhattan project.
a lot of people, including
your professors at brown,
would call that being a hero.
and a lot of people would also
call that war profiteering.
tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved
by advancing
medical technology
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?
all those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.
you ever lose an hour of
sleep your whole life?
i'd be prepared to
lose a few with you.
(christine exclaims)
(tony laughing)
jarvis on speaker: <i>good morning.
it's 7:00 a.m.</i>
<i>the weather in malibu is 72
degrees with scattered clouds.</i>
<i>the surf conditions are fair with
waist-to-shoulder high lines.</i>
<i>high tide will be at 10:52 a.m.</i>
tony?
hey, tony?
<i>(beeping)</i>
jarvis: <i>you are not authorized
to access this area.</i>
- jesus.
- that's jarvis. he runs the house.
i've got your clothes here.
they've been dry-cleaned and pressed,
and there's a car
waiting for you outside
that will take you
anywhere you'd like to go.
you must be the
famous pepper potts.
indeed i am.
after all these years, tony still has
you picking up the dry-cleaning.
i do anything and everything
that mr. stark requires,
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.
will that be all?
<i>(institutionalized playing)</i>
<i>sometimes i try to do things</i>
<i>but it just doesn't work
out the way i want it to,</i>
<i>and i get real frustrated</i>
<i>and then, like, i
try hard to do it</i>
<i>and i, like, take my time</i>
<i>but it just doesn't work
out the way i want it to.</i>
<i>it's like i concentrate
on it real hard</i>
<i>but it just doesn't work out.</i>
give me an exploded view.
jarvis: <i>the compression in
cylinder three appears to be low.</i>
log that.
(music stops)
i'm gonna try
again, right now.
please don't turn
down my music.
i'll keep you posted.
you are supposed to be halfway
around the world right now.
how'd she take it?
like a champ.
why are you trying to
hustle me out of here?
your flight was scheduled to
leave an hour and a half ago.
that's funny, i thought with
it being my plane and all,
that it would just wait
for me to get there.
tony, i need to speak to
you about a couple things
before i get you
out of the door.
doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane
if it departs
before you arrive?
larry called. he's got another buyer
for the jackson pollock in the wings.
do you want it?
yes or no.
is it a good representation
of his spring period?
no. the springs was actually the
neighborhood in east hampton
where he lived and worked,
- not "spring" like the season.
- so?
i think it's a fair example.
i think it's
incredibly overpriced.
i need it. buy it. store it.
okay. the mit
commencement speech...
is in june. please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...
they're haranguing me,
so i'm gonna say yes.
deflect it and absorb it.
don't transmit it back to me.
i need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.
what are you trying to get rid of me for?
what, you got plans?
as a matter of fact, i do.
i don't like it when
you have plans.
i'm allowed to have
plans on my birthday.
- it's your birthday?
- yes.
i knew that. already?
yeah. isn't that strange?
it's the same day as last year.
get yourself something
nice from me.
i already did.
and?
oh, it was very nice.
- yeah.
- very tasteful. thank you, mr. stark.
you're welcome, miss potts.
okay.
you're good. oh, i thought
i lost you back there.
you did, sir. i had to
cut across mulholland.
i got you. i got you.
rhodes: what's wrong with you?
- what?
- three hours.
<i>i got caught doing a
piece for vanity fair.</i>
for three hours. for three hours
you got me standing here.
waiting on you now. let's go.
come on.
wheels up! rock and roll!
- what you reading, platypus?
- nothing.
come on, sour patch.
don't be mad.
i told you, i'm not mad.
i'm indifferent, okay?
- i said i was sorry.
- good morning, mr. stark.
you don't need to apologize
to me. i'm your man.
hi. i told him i was
sorry, but he...
- i'm just indifferent right now.
- hot towel?
you don't respect yourself,
- so i know you don't respect me.
- i respect you.
i'm just your babysitter.
so, when you need your
diaper changed... thank you.
let me know and i'll get
you a bottle, okay?
hey! heat up the
sake, will you?
- thanks for reminding me.
- no, i'm not talking...
we're not drinking.
we're working right now.
- you can't have sashimi without sake.
- you are constitutionally
incapable of being
responsible.
it would be irresponsible
not to drink.
i'm just talking
about a nightcap.
hot sake?
- yes, two, please.
- no.
i'm not drinking.
i don't want any.
that's what i'm talking about.
when i get up in the morning
and i'm putting on my uniform,
you know what i recognize?
i see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!
hey, you know what?
i'm not like you. i'm not cut out...
no, no. you don't
have to be like me!
but you're more
than what you are.
can you excuse me if i'm
a bit distracted here?
no! you can't be distracted right now!
listen to me!
(helicopter whirring)
general.
welcome, mr. stark. we look forward
to your weapons presentation.
thanks.
(chattering in foreign language)
is it better to be
feared or respected?
i say, is it too much
to ask for both?
with that in mind, i humbly
present the crown jewel
of stark industries'
freedom line.
it's the first missile system
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.
they say the best weapon is
one you never have to fire.
i respectfully disagree.
i prefer the weapon you
only have to fire once.
that's how dad did it.
that's how america does it.
and it's worked out
pretty well so far.
find an excuse
to let one of these off the chain,
and i personally guarantee you
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.
for your consideration,
the jericho.
i'll be throwing
one of these in
with every purchase of
to peace!
- <i>tony.
- obie, what are you doing up?</i>
<i>i couldn't sleep till i found
out how it went. how'd it go?</i>
it went great.
looks like it's gonna be an early christmas.
<i>hey! way to go, my boy!
i'll see you tomorrow, yeah?</i>
why aren't you wearing
those pajamas i got you?
<i>good night, tony.</i>
(sighs)
- hey, tony.
- i'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."
the "hum-drum-vee"
is back there.
nice job.
see you back at base.
<i>(back in black playing)</i>
<i>(screaming echoing)</i>
(exhales)
(groans)
(vessel clattering)
(coughing)
(humming)
i wouldn't do that
if i were you.
(groans)
(whistling)
what the hell did
you do to me?
(chuckles)
what i did?
what i did is to
save your life.
i removed all the shrapnel i
could, but there's a lot left,
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.
here, want to see?
i have a souvenir.
take a look.
i've seen many wounds
like that in my village.
we call them the walking dead
because it takes about a week for the
barbs to reach the vital organs.
- what is this?
- that is an electromagnet,
hooked up to a car battery,
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart. hmm?
that's right. smile.
we met once, you know, at a
technical conference in bern.
- i don't remember.
- no, you wouldn't.
if i had been that drunk, i
wouldn't have been able to stand,
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.
where are we?
(man speaking in arabic)
(softly) come on, stand up.
stand up!
just do as i do.
come on, put your hands up.
those are my guns.
how did they get my guns?
do you understand me?
do as i do.
(speaking in arabic)
he says, "welcome, tony stark,
the most famous mass murderer"
"in the history of america."
he is honored.
he wants you to
build the missile.
the jericho missile
that you demonstrated.
this one.
i refuse.
(groaning)
pepper: <i>tony!</i>
(clamoring)
he wants to know
what you think.
i think you got a
lot of my weapons.
he says they have everything you
need to build the jericho missile.
he wants you to make
the list of materials.
he says for you to start
working immediately,
and when you're done,
he will set you free.
no, he won't.
no, he won't.
i'm sure they're looking
for you, stark.
but they will never find
you in these mountains.
look, what you just saw,
that is your legacy, stark.
your life's work, in the
hands of those murderers.
is that how you
want to go out?
is this the last act of defiance
of the great tony stark?
or are you going to do
something about it?
why should i do anything?
they're going to kill me, you, either way.
and if they don't, i'll
probably be dead in a week.
well, then,
this is a very important
week for you, isn't it?
hmm?
tony: if this is going
to be my work station,
(yinsen translating) i want
it well-lit. i want these up.
i need welding gear. i don't care
if it's acetylene or propane.
i need a soldering station. i need
helmets. i'm gonna need goggles.
i would like a smelting cup.
i need two sets of
precision tools.
how many languages
do you speak?
a lot.
but apparently, not
enough for this place.
they speak arabic, urdu,
dari, pashto, mongolian,
farsi, russian.
who are these people?
they are your loyal
customers, sir.
they call themselves
the ten rings.
(chattering in foreign language)
you know, we might
be more productive
if you include me in
the planning process.
uh-huh.
okay, we don't need this.
what is that?
that's palladium, 0.15 grams.
we need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?
(speaking in arabic)
(speaking in foreign language)
careful. careful, we only
get one shot at this.
relax. i have steady hands.
why do you think you're still alive?
huh?
what do i call you?
my name is yinsen.
yinsen. nice to meet you.
nice to meet you, too.
(exclaims)
that doesn't look like
a jericho missile.
that's because it's a
miniaturized arc reactor.
i got a big one powering
my factory at home.
it should keep the
shrapnel out of my heart.
but what could it generate?
if my math is right, and it always
is, three gigajoules per second.
that could run your
heart for 50 lifetimes.
yeah. or something
big for 15 minutes.
this is our ticket
out of here.
what is it?
flatten them out and look.
oh, wow.
impressive.
(speaking in foreign language)
yensin: (chuckling) good.
good roll. good roll.
you still haven't told
me where you're from.
i'm from a small
town called gulmira.
it's actually a nice place.
got a family?
yes, and i will see
them when i leave here.
and you, stark?
no.
no?
so you're a man who
has everything
and nothing.
(speaking in arabic)
(speaking in arabic)
(shouts in arabic)
relax.
the bow and arrow
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.
it allowed the
great genghis khan
to rule from the pacific
to the ukraine.
an empire twice the size
of alexander the great
and four times the size
of the roman empire.
but today,
whoever holds the
latest stark weapons
rules these lands.
and soon,
it will be my turn.
(speaking in urdu)
(chuckling)
what does he want?
what do you want?
a delivery date?
i need him.
good assistant.
you have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.
(raza speaking in urdu)
okay?
can you move?
okay, say it again.
then 16 steps,
that's from the door, fork
right, 33 steps, turn right.
(speaking in arabic)
yinsen! yinsen! stark!
say something.
say something back to him.
- he's speaking hungarian. i don't...
- then speak hungarian.
okay. i know.
what do you know?
(speaking in hungarian)
(man shouting in foreign language)
(shouting in arabic)
- how'd that work?
- oh, my goodness.
- it worked all right.
- that's what i do.
- let me finish this.
- initialize the power sequence.
okay.
- now!
- tell me. tell me.
function 11.
tell me when you see
a progress bar.
- it should be up right now.
- yes.
talk to me. tell me
when you see it.
- i have it.
- press control "i".
- i. got it.
- i. enter. i and "enter."
come over here and
button me up.
(speaking in arabic)
okay. all right.
every other hex bolt.
- they're coming!
- nothing pretty, just get it done.
- just get it done.
- they're coming.
make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?
we need more time.
hey,
i'm gonna go buy
you some time.
stick to the plan!
stick to the plan!
yinsen!
(clamoring)
(screaming)
(guns cocking)
(beeping)
(powering up)
(suit clattering)
(speaking in arabic)
(screaming)
(man screaming)
(screaming stops)
(man shouts in urdu)
(coughing)
yinsen!
watch out!
stark.
come on. we got to go.
move for me, come on. we got a
plan. we're gonna stick to it.
this was always
the plan, stark.
come on, you're gonna go
see your family. get up.
my family is dead.
i'm going to see
them now, stark.
it's okay.
i want this. i want this.
(sighs)
thank you for saving me.
don't waste it.
don't waste your life.
(footsteps echoing)
(men shouting)
my turn.
(clamoring)
(screaming)
(sighs)
not bad.
hey!
(exclaiming)
how was the "fun-vee"?
next time, you ride
with me, okay?
watch it, coming up here.
tony: are you kidding me with this?
get rid of them.
hmm.
your eyes are red. a few tears
for your long-lost boss?
tears of joy.
i hate job hunting.
yeah, vacation's over.
where to, sir?
- take us to the hospital, please, happy.
- no.
no?
tony, you have to
- go to the hospital.
- no is a complete answer.
- the doctor has to look at you.
- i don't have to do anything.
i've been in captivity
for three months.
there are two things i want to do.
i want an american cheeseburger,
- and the other...
- that's enough of that.
is not what you think. i want you
to call for a press conference now.
- call for a press conference?
- yeah.
- what on earth for?
- hogan, drive. cheeseburger first.
(people chattering)
look at this!
tony.
we were going to meet
at the hospital.
no, i'm fine.
look at you!
- you had to have a burger, yeah?
- well, come on.
you get me one of those?
there's only one left.
i need it.
hey, look who's here!
yeah!
- miss potts?
- yes.
can i speak to you
for a moment?
i'm not part of the
press conference,
but it's about to
begin right now.
i'm not a reporter.
i'm agent phil coulson,
with the strategic homeland
intervention, enforcement
and logistics division.
that's quite a mouthful.
i know. we're working on it.
you know, we've been approached already
by the dod, the fbi, the cia...
we're a separate division
with a more specific focus.
we need to debrief mr. stark about
the circumstances of his escape.
i'll put something in
the book, shall i?
thank you.
<i>uh...</i>
hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?
why don't you just sit down?
that way you can see me, and i can...
a little less formal and...
what's up with the love-in?
don't look at me.
i don't know what he's up to.
good to see you.
good to see you.
i never got to say
goodbye to dad.
i never got to say
goodbye to my father.
there's questions that i
would have asked him.
i would have asked him how he
felt about what this company did.
if he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.
or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.
i saw young americans killed
by the very weapons i created to
defend them and protect them.
and i saw
that i had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.
- mr. stark!
- hey, ben.
what happened over there?
i had my eyes opened. i came
to realize that i have more
to offer this world than just
making things that blow up.
<i>and that is why, effective
immediately, i am shutting down</i>
<i>the weapons manufacturing
division of stark international</i>
<i>until such a time as i can decide what
the future of the company will be.</i>
<i>i think we're gonna be
selling a lot of newspapers.</i>
<i>what direction it should take,
one that i'm comfortable with</i>
<i>and is consistent with the highest
good for this country, as well.</i>
(reporters clamoring)
<i>what we should take away from
this is that tony's back!</i>
<i>and he's healthier than ever.</i>
<i>we're going to have a
little internal discussion</i>
<i>and we'll get back to
you with the follow-up.</i>
- where is he?
- he's inside.
well, that... that went well.
did i just paint a target
on the back of my head?
your head?
what about my head?
what do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?
tony: uh, optimistically, 40 points.
at minimum.
yep.
tony, we're a weapons
manufacturer.
obie, i just don't want a body
count to be our only legacy.
that's what we do. we're iron
mongers. we make weapons.
it's my name on the
side of the building.
and what we do keeps the world
from falling into chaos.
not based on what i saw.
we're not doing a
good enough job.
we can do better.
we're gonna do something else.
like what?
you want us to
make baby bottles?
i think we should take another
look into arc reactor technology.
ah, come on. the arc reactor,
that's a publicity stunt!
tony, come on. we built that
thing to shut the hippies up!
- it works.
- yeah, as a science project.
the arc was never
cost effective.
we knew that before
we built it.
arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?
maybe.
huh? am i right? we haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?
- 30 years.
- that's what they say.
could you have a lousier poker face?
just tell me, who told you?
- never mind who told me. show me.
- it's rhodey or pepper.
- i want to see it.
- okay, rhodey.
- okay.
- okay?
it works.
listen to me, tony. we're a
team. do you understand?
there's nothing we can't
do if we stick together,
like your father and i.
i'm sorry i didn't give
you a heads-up, okay?
- but if i had...
- tony.
tony, no more of this "ready,
fire, aim" business.
- you understand me?
- that was dad's line.
you gotta let me handle this.
we're gonna have to play a whole
different kind of ball now.
we're going to have to
take a lot of heat.
i want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.
<i>stark industries!</i>
<i>i've got one recommendation!
ready? ready?</i>
<i>sell, sell, sell!</i>
<i>abandon ship!</i>
<i>does the hindenburg
ring any bells?</i>
<i>(screaming on tv)</i>
<i>let me show you the new stark
industries business plan!</i>
<i>look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!</i>
<i>(toy gun firing)</i>
tony: <i>pepper.
how big are your hands?</i>
- <i>what?
- how big are your hands?</i>
- <i>i don't understand why...
- get down here. i need you.</i>
hey.
let's see them.
show me your hands.
let's see them.
oh, wow. they are small.
very petite, indeed.
i just need your
help for a sec.
oh, my god, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?
it was. it is now an antique.
this is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.
i'm swapping it up for
an upgraded unit,
and i just ran into a
little speed bump.
speed bump, what
does that mean?
it's nothing.
it's just a little snag.
there's an exposed wire
under this device.
and it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.
it's fine.
- what do you want me to do?
- put that on the table over there.
- that is irrelevant.
- oh, my god!
i want you to reach in, and you're
just gonna gently lift the wire out.
- is it safe?
- yeah, it should be fine.
it's like operation.
you just don't let it touch
the socket wall or
it goes "beep."
what do you mean, "operation"?
it's just a game, never mind.
- just gently lift the wire. okay? great.
- okay.
you know, i don't think that
i'm qualified to do this.
no, you're fine. you're the
most capable, qualified,
trustworthy person i've ever
met. you're gonna do great.
is it too much of a problem to ask?
'cause i'm...
- okay, okay.
- i really need your help here.
okay.
oh, there's pus!
it's not pus. it's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,
- not from my body.
- it smells!
yeah, it does.
the copper wire.
the copper wire, you got it?
- okay, i got it! i got it!
- okay, you got it?
now, don't let it.
(buzzing) touch the sides
when you're coming out!
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
that's what i was trying
to tell you before.
okay, now make sure that when
you pull it out, you don't...
there's a magnet at the end of it!
that was it.
(rapid beeping) you
just pulled it out.
- oh, god!
- okay, i was not expecting...
- don't put it back in! don't put it back in!
- okay, what do i do?
what's wrong?
nothing, i'm just going into cardiac arrest
'cause you yanked it out like a trout...
- what? you said it was safe!
- we gotta hurry. take this. take this.
- you gotta switch it out really quick.
- okay. okay.
- tony? it's going to be okay.
- what?
- is it?
- it's gonna be okay.
- i'm gonna make this okay.
- let's hope.
okay, you're gonna attach that to
the base plate. make sure you...
(screams)
was that so hard?
that was fun, right?
here, i got it. i got it.
here.
nice.
- are you okay?
- yeah, i feel great.
you okay?
(laughing)
don't ever, ever, ever,
ever ask me to do anything
like that ever again.
i don't have anyone but you.
anyway...
what do you want me
to do with this?
that?
destroy it.
incinerate it.
you don't want to keep it?
pepper, i've been called many things.
"nostalgic" is not one of them.
will that be all, mr. stark?
that will be all, miss potts.
hey, butterfingers, come here.
what's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?
that's my phone, that's a
picture of me and my dad.
right there. in the garbage.
all that stuff.
rhodes: the future of air combat.
is it manned or unmanned?
i'll tell you, in
my experience,
no unmanned aerial vehicle will
ever trump a pilot's instinct,
his insight,
that ability to look into a
situation beyond the obvious
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.
colonel?
why not a pilot
without the plane?
look who fell out of the sky.
mr. tony stark.
- hello, sir.
- speaking of manned or unmanned,
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong
at spring break. just remember
that, spring break, 1987.
- that lovely lady you woke up with.
- don't do that!
- what was his name?
- don't do that.
- was it ivan?
- don't do that.
they'll believe it.
don't do that.
- okay.
- don't do that.
- pleasure meeting you.
- give us a couple minutes, you guys.
(chattering)
- i'm surprised.
- why?
i swear, i didn't expect to see
you walking around so soon.
i'm doing a little
better than walking.
- really?
- yeah.
rhodey, i'm working
on something big.
i came to talk to you.
i want you to be a part of it.
you're about to make a whole lot
of people around here real happy,
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,
that was a doozy.
this is not for the military.
i'm not... it's different.
what? you're a humanitarian
now or something?
- i need you to listen to me.
- no.
what you need is time
to get your mind right.
- i'm serious.
- okay.
it's nice seeing you, tony.
thanks.
jarvis, you up?
<i>for you, sir, always.</i>
i'd like to open a new project
file, index as mark two.
<i>shall i store this on the stark
industries central database?</i>
actually, i don't know
who to trust right now.
till further notice, why don't
we just keep everything
on my private server?
<i>working on a secret
project, are we, sir?</i>
i don't want this winding
up in the wrong hands.
maybe in mine, it can
actually do some good.
(speaking in foreign language)
next. up.
not in the boot, dummy.
right here. you got me?
stay put. nice.
you're of no benefit at all.
move down to the toe. i got this.
okay, i'm sorry,
am i in your way?
up.
screw it. don't even move.
you are a tragedy.
<i>okay, let's do this right.</i>
<i>start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.</i>
<i>dummy, look alive.
you're on standby for fire safety.</i>
you, roll it.
<i>okay. activate hand controls.</i>
<i>(powering up)</i>
<i>we're gonna start
off nice and easy.</i>
<i>we're gonna see if 10% thrust
capacity achieves lift.</i>
<i>and three,</i>
<i>two,</i>
<i>one.</i>
<i>(groaning)</i>
up two. all right, set that.
i've been buzzing you.
did you hear the intercom?
yeah, everything's... what?
- obadiah's upstairs.
- great!
- what would you like me to tell him?
- great. i'll be right up.
okay.
i thought you said you
were done making weapons.
it is.
this is a flight stabilizer.
it's completely harmless.
i didn't expect that.
(obadiah playing piano)
how'd it go?
it went that bad, huh?
just because i brought
pizza back from new york
- doesn't mean it went bad.
- uh-huh. sure doesn't. oh, boy.
- it would have gone better if you were there.
- uh-uh.
you told me to lay low.
that's what i've been doing.
- i lay low, and you take care of all...
- hey, come on.
in public. the press.
this was a board of
directors meeting.
this was a board of
directors meeting?
the board is claiming you
have posttraumatic stress.
they're filing an injunction.
- a what?
- they want to lock you out.
why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?
we knew that was gonna happen.
- fifty-six and a half.
- it doesn't matter.
we own the controlling
interest in the company.
tony, the board
has rights, too.
they're making the case that
you and your new direction
- isn't in the company's best interest.
- i'm being responsible!
that's a new direction
for me, for the company.
i mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...
this is great.
- oh, come on. tony. tony.
- i'll be in the shop.
hey, hey!
hey, tony. listen.
i'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.
something to pitch them.
let me have the engineers analyze
that. you know, draw up some specs.
- no. no, absolutely not.
- it'll give me a bone to throw the boys
- in new york!
- this one stays with me.
that's it, obie. forget it.
all right, well, this
stays with me, then.
go on, here, you
can have a piece.
- take two.
- thank you.
you mind if i come down there
and see what you're doing?
good night, obie.
day 11, test 37, configuration
dummy is still on fire safety.
if you douse me again,
and i'm not on fire, i'm
donating you to a city college.
<i>all right, nice and easy.</i>
<i>seriously, just gonna start
off with 1% thrust capacity.</i>
<i>and three, two, one.</i>
okay.
please don't follow me
around with it, either,
'cause i feel like i'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.
just stand down!
if something happens, then come in.
and again, let's
bring it up to 2.5.
three, two, one.
(grunting)
okay, this is where
i don't want to be!
oh, not the car, not the car!
(exclaims)
table!
<i>(laughing nervously)</i>
could be worse! could be worse!
we're fine! okay.
no! uh-uh! uh-uh! uh!
yeah, i can fly.
- <i>jarvis, are you there?
- at your service, sir.</i>
engage heads up display.
<i>check.</i>
import all preferences
from home interface.
<i>will do, sir.</i>
all right, what do you say?
<i>i have indeed been uploaded,
sir. we're online and ready.</i>
can we start the
virtual walk-around?
<i>importing preferences and
calibrating virtual environment.</i>
do a check on
control surfaces.
<i>as you wish.</i>
<i>test complete. preparing to power
down and begin diagnostics.</i>
uh, yeah. tell you what.
do a weather and atc check.
start listening in
on ground control.
<i>sir, there are still terabytes</i>
<i>of calculations needed before
an actual flight is...</i>
jarvis! sometimes you got
to run before you can walk.
ready?
in three, two, one.
(exclaiming)
(whooping)
handles like a dream.
all right, let's see
what this thing can do.
what's sr-71's record?
<i>the altitude record for fixed
wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.</i>
records are made to be broken!
come on!
<i>sir, there is a potentially
fatal buildup of ice occurring.</i>
keep going!
higher!
(gasps)
(screaming)
we iced up, jarvis!
deploy flaps! jarvis!
come on, we got
to break the ice!
(honking)
(exclaiming)
kill power.
(chattering in foreign language)
notes. main transducer feels
sluggish at plus 40 altitude.
hull pressurization
is problematic.
i'm thinking icing is
the probable factor.
jarvis: <i>a very astute
observation, sir.</i>
<i>perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,</i>
<i>we should improve
the exosystems.</i>
connect to the sys. co. have it
reconfigure the shell metals.
use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.
that should ensure a
fuselage integrity
while maintaining
power-to-weight ratio.
- <i>got it?
- yes.</i>
<i>shall i render using
proposed specifications?</i>
thrill me.
reporter on tv: <i>tonight's
red-hot red carpet</i>
<i>is right here at the
disney concert hall,</i>
<i>where tony stark's
third annual benefit</i>
<i>for the firefighter's
family fund</i>
<i>has become the place to be
for l.a.'s high society.</i>
jarvis, we get an
invite for that?
jarvis: <i>i have no record
of an invitation, sir.</i>
woman on tv: <i>hasn't
been seen in public</i>
<i>since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.</i>
<i>some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress</i>
<i>and has been bedridden for
weeks. whatever the case may be,</i>
<i>no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.</i>
jarvis: <i>the render is complete.</i>
a little ostentatious,
don't you think?
<i>what was i thinking?
you're usually so discreet.</i>
tell you what. throw a
little hot-rod red in there.
<i>yes, that should help
you keep a low profile.</i>
<i>the render is complete.</i>
hey, i like it. fabricate it.
paint it.
<i>commencing automated assembly.</i>
<i>estimated completion
time is five hours.</i>
don't wait up for me, honey.
(people chattering)
weapons manufacturing is only one
small part of what stark industries
is all about, and
our partnership.
(people exclaiming) with the
fire and rescue community...
hey, tony, remember me?
sure don't.
you look great, hef.
we're going to have
a great quarter.
what's the world coming to when a
guy's got to crash his own party?
look at you. hey,
what a surprise.
i'll see you inside.
hey. listen, take
it slow, all right?
i think i got the board
right where we want them.
you got it. just cabin fever.
i'll just be a minute.
give me a scotch.
i'm starving.
mr. stark?
- yeah?
- agent coulson.
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
the guy from the...
strategic homeland intervention,
enforcement and logistics division.
(sighs) god, you need
a new name for that.
yeah, i hear that a lot.
listen, i know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.
there's still a lot of
unanswered questions,
and time can be a factor
with these things.
let's just put something
on the books.
how about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
at stark industries?
tell you what. you got it.
you're absolutely right.
well, i'm going to go to my
assistant, and we'll make a date.
you look fantastic!
i didn't recognize you.
- what are you doing here?
- just avoiding government agents.
- are you by yourself?
- yes. where'd you get that dress?
- oh, it was a birthday present.
- that's great.
- from you, actually.
- well, i got great taste.
yes.
- you want to dance?
- oh, no.
- all right, come on.
- thank you. no.
am i making you uncomfortable?
no. no. i always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss
in front of everyone that i work
with in a dress with no back.
you look great and
you smell great.
oh, god.
but i could fire you if that
would take the edge off.
i actually don't think that you
could tie your shoes without me.
- i'd make it a week. sure.
- really?
what's your social
security number?
- five.
- five?
- right.
- right.
you're missing just a
couple of digits there.
the other eight?
so i got you for the other eight.
- how about a little air?
- yes, i need some air.
(clears throat)
- that was totally weird.
- totally harmless.
it was totally not
harmless, by the way.
we're dancing.
no one's even watching.
everybody who i work with...
no, you know why?
i think you lost objectivity. i think
they just... people... we just danced.
no, it was not just a dance.
you don't understand because you're you.
and everybody knows
exactly who you are
and how you are with girls and all
of that, which is completely fine.
but, you know, then
me, you're my boss,
- and i'm dancing with you.
- i don't think it was taken that way.
because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...
- i just think you're overstating it.
- you know, and we're here,
and then i'm wearing
this ridiculous
dress, and then we were
dancing like that and...
i would like a drink, please.
got it, okay.
- i would like a vodka martini, please.
- okay.
very dry with olives, a lot of
olives. like, at least three olives.
two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.
make one of them
dirty, will you?
wow. tony stark.
oh, hey.
fancy seeing you here.
- carrie.
- christine.
that's right.
you have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.
can i at least get a
reaction from you?
panic. i would say
panic is my reaction.
'cause i was referring
to your company's
involvement in this
latest atrocity.
yeah. they just put my
name on the invitation.
i don't know what to tell you.
i actually almost bought
it, hook, line and sinker.
i was out of town for a couple
months, in case you didn't hear.
is this what you
call accountability?
it's a town called gulmira.
heard of it?
when were these taken?
yesterday.
- i didn't approve any shipment.
- well, your company did.
well, i'm not my company.
please, do you mind?
have you seen these pictures?
huh?
- what's going on in gulmira?
- tony, tony.
you can't afford
to be this naive.
you know what?
i was naive before,
when they said, "here's the
line. we don't cross it."
"this is how we do business."
if we're double-dealing
under the table... are we?
man: tony, your picture, please!
let's take a picture. come on.
picture time!
(reporters clamoring)
tony. who do you think
locked you out?
i was the one who filed the
injunction against you.
it was the only way i
could protect you.
no. no.
<i>the 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of gulmira can only be described</i>
<i>as a descent into hell, into a
modern day heart of darkness.</i>
<i>simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages</i>
<i>have been driven
from their homes,</i>
<i>displaced from their
lands by warlords</i>
<i>emboldened by a
new-found power.</i>
<i>villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings</i>
<i>they can find in the
ruins of other villages,</i>
<i>or here in the remnants of an
old soviet smelting plant.</i>
<i>recent violence has been attributed
to a group of foreign fighters</i>
<i>referred to by locals
as the ten rings.</i>
<i>as you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.</i>
<i>a mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.</i>
<i>with no political will or
international pressure,</i>
<i>there's very little hope
for these refugees.</i>
<i>around me, a woman begging
for news on her husband,</i>
<i>who was kidnapped
by insurgents,</i>
<i>either forced to join
their militia...</i>
<i>desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,</i>
<i>holding them up to
anyone who will stop.</i>
<i>a child's simple question, "where
are my mother and father?"</i>
<i>there's very little hope
for these refugees,</i>
<i>refugees who can only wonder
who, if anyone, will help.</i>
(people screaming)
(speaking in arabic)
(woman screaming)
(shouts in foreign language)
(rumbling)
(speaking in foreign language)
<i>he's all yours.</i>
what the hell was that?
were we cleared to go in there?
no, they were using human shields.
we never got the green light.
put me through to state.
they're going to be all over this.
man 1: get those monitors up!
we got a bogey!
man 2: wasn't air force!
we got the cia on the line?
i've got langley on the line.
they want to know if it's us.
no, it definitely
is not us, sir!
- it wasn't navy.
- wasn't marines.
i need answers!
can i please get eyes on target?
- man 3: negative, negative.
- man 4: cannot identify.
get me colonel rhodes from weapons
development down here now!
we ran an id check
and cross-referenced
with all known databases.
we have nothing.
any high altitude
surveillance in the region?
we got an awac and a
global hawk in the area.
so this thing just
appeared out of nowhere?
how come it didn't
show up on the radar?
got a minimal radar
cross-section, sir.
- is it stealth?
- no, sir, it's tiny.
we think it's an
unmanned aerial vehicle.
colonel, what are we
dealing with here?
- let me make a call.
- sergeant, clear a hole.
<i>(cell phone ringing)</i>
- hello?
- tony?
- <i>who's this?
- it's rhodes.</i>
- <i>sorry, hello?
- i said it's rhodes.</i>
- speak up, please.
- what in the hell is that noise?
oh, yeah, i'm driving
with the top down.
yeah, well, i need
your help right now.
<i>it's funny how
that works, huh?</i>
yeah. speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up
a few clicks from where you
were being held captive.
<i>well, that's a hot spot.</i>
<i>sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?</i>
why do you sound out
of breath, tony?
<i>i'm not, i was just
jogging in the canyon.</i>
<i>i thought you were driving.
right, i was driving</i>
<i>to the canyon, where
i'm going to jog.</i>
you sure you don't have any tech
in that area i should know about?
- <i>nope!</i>
- man: <i>bogey spotted!</i>
major allen: whiplash,
come in hot.
okay, good, 'cause
i'm staring at one
right now, and it's about to
be blown to kingdom come.
that's my exit.
<i>ballroom, this is whiplash one.
i've got the bogey in my sights.</i>
whiplash one, what is it?
<i>i've got no idea.</i>
major allen: you have radio contact?
<i>non responsive, sir.</i>
then you are clear to engage.
tony: <i>hit it.</i>
<i>that bogey just went supersonic.
i got a lock!</i>
- jarvis: <i>inbound missile.</i>
- tony: <i>flares!</i>
<i>wait a second.
bogey deployed flares!</i>
(exclaims)
(shouts)
(grunting)
deploy flaps!
holy!
that thing just jumped
off the radar, sir.
the sat visual has been lost.
<i>no way that's a uav.</i>
what is it?
i can't see anything.
<i>whatever it was, it
just bought the farm.</i>
<i>i think bogey's
been handled, sir.</i>
(cell phone ringing)
- <i>hello?</i>
- tony: <i>hi, rhodey, it's me.</i>
- <i>it's who?
- i'm sorry, it is me.</i>
<i>you asked. what you were
asking about is me.</i>
no, see, this isn't a game.
you do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.
- you understand that?
- this is not a piece of equipment.
i'm in it. it's a suit. it's me!
rhodey, you got
anything for me?
major allen: <i>mark your
position and return to base.</i>
<i>roger that, ballroom.</i>
<i>on your belly!</i>
<i>it looks like a man!</i>
<i>shake him off!
roll! roll!</i>
<i>i'm hit! i'm hit!</i>
man 4: it's confirmed.
he has been hit.
whiplash two: <i>punch out!
punch out!</i>
<i>whiplash one down.</i>
whiplash two, do
you see a chute?
<i>negative!
no chute, no chute!</i>
<i>(whiplash one groaning)</i>
<i>my chute's jammed!</i>
<i>sir, i've got a
visual on the bogey.</i>
whiplash two, reengage. if you
get a clear shot, you take it.
major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.
call off the raptors.
that thing just took out an f-22
inside a legal no fly zone!
whiplash two, if you have
a clear shot, take it!
jarvis: <i>you've been reengaged.
execute evasive maneuver.</i>
keep going!
whiplash one: <i>good chute!
good chute!</i>
(all cheering)
tony, you still there?
<i>hey, thanks.</i>
oh, my god, you crazy
son of a bitch.
you owe me a plane.
you know that, right?
(chuckling)
yeah, well,
technically, he hit me.
<i>now are you going to come by
and see what i'm working on?</i>
no, no, no, no, no, no, the
less i know, the better.
now, what am i supposed
to tell the press?
tony: <i>training exercise.
isn't that the usual bs?</i>
rhodes: <i>it's not that simple.</i>
an unfortunate
training exercise
involving an f-22 raptor
occurred yesterday.
i am pleased to report that
the pilot was not injured.
<i>as for the unexpected turn of
events on the ground in gulmira,</i>
<i>it is still unclear who
or what intervened,</i>
<i>but i can assure you that the united
states government was not involved.</i>
tony: hey!
(groaning)
jarvis: <i>it is a
tight fit, sir.</i>
<i>sir, the more you struggle, the
more this is going to hurt.</i>
be gentle.
this is my first time.
i designed this to
come off, so...
(groans)
hey.
i really should be able to...
jarvis: <i>please, try
not to move, sir.</i>
what's going on here?
let's face it. this is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.
are those bullet holes?
(chattering in foreign language)
welcome.
compliments of tony stark.
if you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.
you paid us trinkets
to kill a prince.
show me the weapon.
come. leave your
guards outside.
his escape bore
unexpected fruit.
so this is how he did it.
this is only a
first, crude effort.
stark has perfected
his design.
he has made a
masterpiece of death.
a man with a dozen of these
can rule all of asia.
and you dream of
stark's throne.
we have a common enemy.
if we are still in business,
i will give you these designs
as a gift.
and in turn,
i hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.
(high-pitched buzzing)
(gasping)
(speaking in urdu)
technology.
it's always been your achilles'
heel in this part of the world.
don't worry. it'll only
last for 15 minutes.
that's the least
of your problems.
crate up the armor
and the rest of it.
all right, let's
finish up here.
(guns firing)
set up sector 16 underneath
the arc reactor,
and i'm going to want
this data masked.
recruit our top engineers.
i want a prototype right away.
hey. you busy?
you mind if i send you on an errand?
i need you to go to my office.
you're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all
the recent shipping manifests.
this is a lock chip.
this'll get you in.
it's probably under
executive files.
if not, they put it on a ghost
drive, in which case you need
to look for the lowest
numeric heading.
and what do you plan to do with this
information if i bring it back here?
same drill.
they've been dealing under the
table, and i'm going to stop them.
i'm going to find my
weapons and destroy them.
tony,
you know that i would
help you with anything,
but i cannot help you if you're
going to start all of this again.
there is nothing except this.
there's no art opening.
there is no benefit.
there is nothing to sign.
there is the next mission
and nothing else.
is that so?
well, then, i quit.
you stood by my side
all these years
while i reaped the
benefits of destruction.
and now that i'm trying
to protect the people
that i put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?
you're going to kill
yourself, tony.
i'm not going to
be a part of it.
i shouldn't be alive,
unless it was for a reason.
i'm not crazy, pepper.
i just finally know
what i have to do.
and i know in my heart
that it's right.
(exhales)
you're all i have,
too, you know.
sector 16?
what are you up to, obadiah?
<i>(speaking in urdu)</i>
<i>you did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great tony stark.</i>
- <i>as you can see, obadiah stane...
- oh, my god.</i>
<i>your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.</i>
<i>the price to kill tony
stark has just gone up.</i>
so, what are we going
to do about this?
hmm?
i know what you're
going through, pepper.
tony. he always gets the
good stuff, doesn't he?
i was so happy
when he came home.
it was like we got him
back from the dead.
now i realize,
well, tony never really
did come home, did he?
he left a part of
himself in that cave.
breaks my heart.
well, he's a
complicated person.
he's been through a lot.
i think he'll be all right.
you are a very rare woman.
tony doesn't know
how lucky he is.
thank you. thanks.
i'd better get back there.
is that today's paper?
yes.
do you mind?
- not at all.
- puzzle.
of course.
take care.
(exclaims)
ms. potts?
we had an appointment.
did you forget about
our appointment?
nope, right now. come with me.
- 3right now?
- we're going to have it right now.
- yeah, walk with me.
- okay.
i'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. your office.
yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.
absolutely, we're... i'm going
to have to call you back.
mr. stane?
sir, we've explored
what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.
- actually...
- a hiccup?
yes, to power the suit, sir, the
technology actually doesn't exist.
- so it's...
- wait, wait, wait. the technology?
william, here is
the technology.
i've asked you to
simply make it smaller.
okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.
tony stark was able to build this in a cave!
with a box of scraps!
well, i'm sorry.
i'm not tony stark.
(cell phone ringing)
- <i>(high-pitched buzzing)</i>
- pepper: <i>tony?</i>
<i>tony, are you there?
hello?</i>
breathe.
easy, easy.
you remember this one, right?
it's a shame the government
didn't approve it.
there's so many applications for
causing short-term paralysis.
ah, tony.
when i ordered the hit on you,
i worried that i was
killing the golden goose.
but, you see, it was just
(gasping)
fate that you survived that.
you had one last
golden egg to give.
do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?
your father, he helped
give us the atomic bomb.
now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?
oh, it's beautiful.
oh, tony, this is
your ninth symphony.
ah. what a masterpiece.
look at that.
this is your legacy.
a new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.
weapons that will help steer
the world back on course,
put the balance of
power in our hands.
the right hands.
i wish you could've
seen my prototype.
it's not as...
well, not as
conservative as yours.
too bad you had to
involve pepper in this.
i would have preferred
that she lived.
what do you mean, he paid
to have tony killed?
pepper, slow down.
why would obadiah...
okay, where's tony now?
i don't know. he's not
answering his phone.
please go over there and
make sure everything's okay.
thank you, rhodey.
i know a shortcut.
<i>(heart beating rhythmically)</i>
(dummy approaching)
good boy.
tony?
tony?
tony?
tony?
tony!
tony! you okay?
where's pepper?
she's fine.
she's with five agents.
they're about to
arrest obadiah.
that's not going to be enough.
section 16. section 16.
there it is.
<i>(beeps)</i>
my key's not working.
it's not opening the door.
oh, wow! what's that?
it's, like, a little device?
it's, like, a thing that's
going to pick the lock?
you might want to take
a few steps back.
that's the coolest
thing i've ever seen.
not bad, huh?
let's do it.
you need me to do
anything else?
<i>keep the skies clear.</i>
damn!
next time, baby.
looks like you were right.
he was building a suit.
i thought it'd be bigger.
(jingling)
(screams)
how do you think the mark one
chest piece is going to hold up?
jarvis: <i>the suit's at 48%
power and falling, sir.</i>
<i>that chest piece was never
designed for sustained flight.</i>
keep me posted.
tony: <i>pepper!</i>
tony! tony, are you okay?
<i>i'm fine. how are...</i>
- <i>obadiah, he's gone insane!
- i know.</i>
- <i>listen, you'd better get out of there.
- he built a suit.</i>
<i>(rumbling) get out
of there right now!</i>
<i>where do you think
you're going?</i>
(shouts)
<i>your services are
no longer required.</i>
tony: <i>stane!</i>
(screaming)
(honks)
<i>i love this suit!</i>
<i>put them down!</i>
<i>collateral damage, tony.</i>
divert power to chest rt.
jarvis: <i>power reduced to 19%.</i>
<i>lady!</i>
<i>no, no, no, no, no, no!</i>
(people clamoring)
<i>for 30 years, i've
been holding you up!</i>
<i>i built this company
from nothing!</i>
<i>nothing is going to
stand in my way.</i>
<i>least of all you!</i>
<i>impressive!
you've upgraded your armor!</i>
<i>i've made some
upgrades of my own!</i>
jarvis: <i>sir, it appears
that his suit can fly.</i>
duly noted. take me
to maximum altitude.
jarvis: <i>with only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...</i>
tony: i know the math!
do it!
sir, you're not going to believe
this. that thing is back.
get me major allen.
scramble the jets!
not necessary, people.
just a training exercise.
yes, sir.
- jarvis: <i>thirteen percent power, sir.
- climb!</i>
- <i>eleven percent.
- keep going!</i>
- <i>seven percent power.
- just leave it on the screen!</i>
stop telling me!
<i>you had a great idea, tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!</i>
<i>how'd you solve the
icing problem?</i>
<i>icing problem?</i>
<i>might want to look into it.</i>
jarvis: <i>two percent.</i>
<i>we are now running on
emergency backup power.</i>
whoa!
- potts!
- tony! oh, my god, are you okay?
i'm almost out of power. i've got to get
out of this thing. i'll be right there.
<i>nice try!</i>
(grunts)
tony: weapons status?
jarvis: <i>repulsors offline.
missiles offline.</i>
flares!
(groaning)
<i>very clever, tony.</i>
- potts?
- tony!
this isn't working.
we're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.
well, how are you
going to do that?
you're going to do it.
go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.
when i get clear of the
roof, i'll let you know.
you're going to hit the
master bypass button.
it's going to fry
everything up here.
okay. i'm going in now.
make sure you wait till i clear
the roof. i'll buy you some time.
tony: <i>this looks important!</i>
i never had a taste for
this sort of thing,
but i must admit, i'm
deeply enjoying the suit!
you finally outdid
yourself, tony!
you'd have made
your father proud!
it's ready, tony!
get off the roof!
(groaning)
(screams)
pepper: tony!
how ironic, tony!
trying to rid the
world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!
- pepper!
- and now i'm going to kill you with it!
you ripped out my
targeting system!
time to hit the button!
you told me not to!
hold still, you little prick!
just do it!
you'll die!
push it!
(screaming)
pepper: tony!
<i>you've all received the official
statement of what occurred</i>
<i>at stark industries
last night.</i>
<i>there have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned</i>
<i>and caused damage
to the arc reactor.</i>
<i>fortunately, a member of tony
stark's personal security staff...</i>
"iron man." that's kind of catchy.
it's got a nice ring to it.
i mean, it's not
technically accurate.
the suit's a
gold-titanium alloy,
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.
here's your alibi.
okay.
- you were on your yacht.
- yeah.
we have port papers that put
you in avalon all night,
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.
see, i was thinking maybe we should
say it was just pepper and me
alone on the island.
- that's what happened.
- all right.
just read it, word for word.
there's nothing
about stane here.
that's being handled.
he's on vacation.
small aircraft have such
a poor safety record.
but what about the whole cover
story that it's a bodyguard?
he's my... i mean, is that...
that's kind of flimsy, don't you think?
this isn't my first rodeo, mr.
stark.
just stick to the
official statement,
and soon, this will
all be behind you.
you've got 90 seconds.
oh, agent coulson?
i just wanted to say thank you
very much for all of your help.
that's what we do.
you'll be hearing from us.
from the strategic homeland...
just call us s.h.i.e.l.d.
right.
let's get this
show on the road.
you know, it's
actually not that bad.
even i don't think
i'm iron man.
- you're not iron man.
- am so.
- you're not.
- all right, suit yourself.
you know, if i were iron man, i'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.
she'd be a wreck, 'cause
she'd always be worrying
that i was going to die,
yet so proud of the
man i'd become.
she'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more
(clears throat)
crazy about me.
tell me you never think
about that night.
- what night?
- you know.
are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,
and you left me
there, by myself?
is that the night
you're talking about?
mmm-hmm.
thought so.
- will that be all, mr. stark?
- yes, that will be all, miss potts.
<i>and now, mr. stark has
prepared a statement.</i>
<i>he will not be taking any
questions. thank you.</i>
<i>been a while since i
was in front of you.</i>
<i>i figure i'll stick to
the cards this time.</i>
(all laughing)
(clears throat)
<i>there's been speculation that i was
involved in the events that occurred</i>
<i>on the freeway and
the rooftop...</i>
i'm sorry, mr. stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that
that was a bodyguard in a suit
that conveniently appeared,
<i>despite the fact that you...
i know that it's confusing.</i>
<i>it is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely</i>
<i>to make wild accusations, or
insinuate that i'm a superhero.</i>
i never said you
were a superhero.
- <i>didn't?
- mmm-mmm.</i>
<i>well, good, because that would
be outlandish and fantastic.</i>
(tony sighs)
<i>i'm just not the hero type.
clearly.</i>
<i>with this laundry list
of character defects,</i>
<i>all the mistakes i've made,</i>
<i>largely public.</i>
(softly) just stick
to the cards, man.
yeah, okay. yeah.
<i>the truth is.</i>
<i>i am iron man.</i>
(all clamoring)
(door opens)
jarvis!
<i>welcome home, sir.</i>
"i am iron man." you think you're
the only superhero in the world?
mr. stark, you've become
part of a bigger universe.
you just don't know it yet.
who the hell are you?
nick fury, director
of s.h.i.e.l.d.
ah.
i'm here to talk to you about
the avenger initiative.
