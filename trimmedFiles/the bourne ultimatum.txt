(train whistle blowing)
(police siren blaring)
(bourne groaning)
(grunting)
(breathing heavily)
<i>send him in.</i>
(speaking in russian)
<i>will you commit to this program?</i>
<i>i can't.</i>
(grunting)
<i>will you commit to this program?</i>
<i>will you commit to this program?</i>
<i>i can't.</i>
<i>abbott: there's no place
it won't catch up to you.</i>
<i>it's how every story ends.</i>
<i>it's what you are,
jason, a killer.</i>
<i>you always will be.</i>
<i>go ahead. go on.
go on! do it! do it!</i>
(bourne breathing heavily)
<i>bourne: she wouldn't want me to.</i>
<i>that's the only
reason you're alive.</i>
kramer: who is "she"?
marie kreutz, his girlfriend.
she was killed in india.
director of operations
ward abbott arranged it.
so we have a dirty section
chief who kills bourne's girl.
bourne comes back for revenge,
tapes abbott's confession
and abbott commits suicide.
now bourne's gunning for us.
you couldn't
make this stuff up.
bourne's last confirmed location
was moscow, six weeks ago.
- right.
- sir.
he's on the run.
he's dangerous.
well, sir, with respect, i think
something else could be going on here.
what? what's he after?
the reason bourne went to moscow was
to see the daughter of his first target.
what's your point, pam?
maybe he was
retracing his steps.
he's looking for something.
something in his past.
maybe he hasn't found it yet
and we need to know what it is.
are you telling me he's not
a threat to this agency?
i think if he wanted to hurt us,
he could have sent the tape to cnn.
maybe he still will.
my number one rule is hope for
the best, plan for the worst.
as far as i'm concerned, bourne is still
a serious threat until proven otherwise.
let's keep looking.
- yes, sir.
- yes, sir.
ross: this one's three years ago.
they had half of interpol after him.
turned up in naples,
berlin, moscow...
disappeared again.
the girl that he
was on the run with.
marie kreutz. she was found dead
in a river halfway round the world.
she'd been shot in the head.
what connects the dots?
turn off the tape recorder.
(door closing)
where's my sister?
why don't you sit down?
where is she?
she's dead.
she was killed.
i'm sorry.
i knew this could
end this way.
it was always
gonna end this way.
i didn't believe that.
and how did she die?
she was shot.
we were together in india.
he came for me.
you killed him?
yes.
and now what?
someone started all of this
and i'm gonna find them.
hey. it's me.
yeah. he knows
the whole story.
bourne's just the
tip of the iceberg.
have you heard
of an operation blackbriar?
i'm gonna get my head
around this and type it up.
i'll see you first thing.
okay.
(monitor beeping)
woman: scanning. gosat 21.
i have a hit on echelon. blackbriar.
i repeat, blackbriar.
looks like it's coming
from a european signal.
nsa, please confirm
your receipt.
woman: i'll bring up the
frequency and the coordinates
...intercept of our principal...
- sir!
- what you got?
we intercepted a call in london.
keyword, "blackbriar."
okay, send it to
new york right away.
track the phone?
registered to a london
reporter named simon ross.
works at the
guardian newspaper.
- you're tracking him?
- sir. yeah.
thanks, mike.
we have a survey team
covering him at work
and a sneak and peek's
on their way to his apartment.
well, who talked to him? how
did he find out about blackbriar?
i don't know.
we pulled his background
and ran a cross-check
on any known anomalies.
we've come up with nothing. but i think
if we follow ross, we're gonna be able...
ray, ross is easy.
we want the source.
ross: have you heard of
an operation blackbriar?
man: you have details?
ross: i'm gonna get my head
around this and type it up.
i'll see you first thing.
- is that all?
- yeah.
i want rendition protocols and put
the asset on standby, just in case.
people, listen up!
this is a full priority situation.
jimmy, give me
ross' profile on one.
yes, sir.
our target is a british national,
simon ross. a reporter.
i want all his phones, his
blackberry, his apartment, his car,
bank accounts, credit cards,
travel patterns.
i want to know what he's
gonna think before he does.
every dirty little
secret he has.
and most of all, we want the name
and real-time location of his source.
this is nsa priority level four.
any questions?
all right, let's get to it.
what?
<i>will you commit to this program?</i>
<i>i can't.</i>
copy that. mr. wills, the
subject is entering his office.

wills: jimmy, how you
doing with the phone line?
jimmy: yeah, we have an office line.
we're working on his cell.
- wills: how long?
- an hour, sir.
that's too long.
so how do we know he's not
spinning for someone?
there was more. he was scared.
- scared about what?
- blackbriar.
(knocking)
- sorry. call for you.
- ross: who is it?
won't give his name.
excuse me.
- he's on my line.
- thanks.
simon ross.
man: camera three, screen.

jimmy, i need that phone.
bourne: i want you to listen very
carefully to what i'm about to tell you.
what the hell's going on?
ten o'clock, to your left, across the
street, there's a silver chrysler voyager.
there's a surveillance team inside.
directly across the street,
twelve noon,
there's a man on the
second story, static post.
he's watching you.
now, there's a bus stop
i want you to walk towards it.
wills: jimmy, i need that
phone! i need it yesterday.
he's on the move.
he's on the move.
jimmy: that's not his phone, sir.
say again?
that's not his phone, sir.

where the hell did
he get another phone?
man: well, no, you just have to...
brian: grab team b, stand by.
grab team b.
we're in position.

wills: jimmy, we need the call.
i need that cell phone.
brian: do not let him get out of sight.
all right, turn around.
okay, who's the guy
in the blue hood?
is that his contact?
all right, there's a bus coming.
it'll be there in ten seconds.
when it stops, i want you
to walk directly to your left.

stairs. stop at the newsstand.
you'll get
further instructions.

(man groaning)

communication with mobile one.
to the right! heading west. let
us know when you get a visual!
what was the last
known position, please?
jimmy: on the walkway, heading
towards the concourse, sir.
it's a surveillance nightmare.
it's the busiest terminal in london.
give me all of cctv's eyes.
woman: on it, sir.
man: sir, asset's on scene.
(tires screeching)
who's your source?
what's his name?
what's your source's name?
look, what's going on?
why are these people after me?
because you found something.
you talked to someone
inside treadstone.
someone who was there at
the beginning. who is it?
you know i can't tell you that.
you have no idea what you're into here.
these people will kill you, if they have to.
was it blackbriar?
is that what this is?
what's blackbriar?
treadstone upgrade. my source
told me it all started with you.
he said that you were square
one, the dirty little secret.
he said he knows
who you are.
aii right, we have to move.
answer your phone.
- coming online.
- man: you got visual?
where the hell is he, people?
do exactly as i say. i need
you to move up to your right.
first escalator on the right.
tie your shoe. tie your shoe
right now. tie your shoe.
wait.
wait.
i'm gonna walk by you. i want
you to move along the far wall
to your left in four,
three, two, one.
stand up.
that's it.
where the hell is he?
we cannot afford
to lose this guy, people.
aii right, that line you're on is good.
stay on that line. stay on that line.
woman: i've gotta go and pick up the
kids. can you go and get the shopping done?
oh, the bin man,
i think he's one of them.
the garbage man? negative.
oh, jesus. jesus!
he's reaching for something.
- oh, god, he's got a gun.
- bourne: stay on the line.
he's got a gun.
he's got a gun.
stay on the line you're on.
do not deviate.
okay, there he is!
here he goes.
grab team a. go!
he's still talking
to somebody.
he's getting instructions.
jimmy, get me the conversation.
- mobile two, i want...
- man: come on, lock the box.
lock the box.
move in, grab team c.
hurry, ross. we gotta move.
okay, move through this crowd.
move through this crowd.
get undercover right now.
move through this crowd.
get in the store.
there's someone on your tail.
get in the store.
you're gonna proceed
out the east exit.
that's to your right
as you come into the store.
(man groaning)
head into the liquor
store in front of you.
go into the back
and lock the door.
mobile four is down.
this guy's got help. tell me
when the asset's in the nest.
get me a feed in there!
i want grab team c in there.
tell me what's going on.
team four is mobile.
(grunting)
(gasping)
jesus christ.
that's jason bourne.
he's picking us apart.
do you think he's the source?
he's gotta be.
block all the exits.
give the asset a green light.
take them both out.
stay there.
i'm gonna get us out of here.
you gotta do exactly what i say.
listen to me! this isn't
some story in a newspaper.
this is real.
you understand me?
okay.
call all agents back.
give bourne's location at the
back of the store to the asset.
yes, sir.
kill the cameras.
ross: bourne.
wait. something's not right.
i can see the entrance from
here. if i go now, i can make it.
bourne?
just stay where you are.
ross: i don't think we should wait!
i think someone's coming.
i'm going for it.
no, no, no, no, no!
(woman screaming)
(ambulance siren blaring)
we have a situation.
pamela: yeah.
director kramer
would like to see you.
we need to get
those warrants...
he said it's urgent.
reporter: what the police will tell me is
that they believe the victim is 35-year-old
simon ross, a well-known
journalist based here in london
with the guardian newspaper.
it appears that
he was gunned down
right in the middle of the
waterloo station concourse
around 3:45 this afternoon
in full view of
hundreds of commuters.
over the years,
he's uncovered a lot of
unsavory stories about terror
that have upset certain
western governments and...
- hi, how are you?
- right over there?
all right.
- good morning, sir. can i take your order?
- yes.
i'll have the heart-healthy omelet
with goat cheese and peppers, please.
- anything for you, ma'am?
- just coffee, please.
are you sure?
i'm buying.
i'm good.
so, when the director called and it
was suggested that we bring you on...
suggested? you sure it
was just a suggestion?
you know, it's funny
how different things look
depending on where
you sit, right?
i look at this as
a favor for you, pam,
giving you an opportunity to
complete some unfinished business.
meaning?
bourne. he's here.
he's a threat.
and we both want
the same thing.
but we both go about it
in two very different ways.
the past is past, pam. aii right?
we were careless
in stockholm.
so what was waterloo?
just careless again?
we had a leak. a serious
national security situation.
bourne showed up on our surveillance
and we had very little time to react.
and a reporter got killed.
bourne saw us coming. the question
is what was he doing there?
no, the real question
is how you managed
to get into a firefight
at a public train station.
you know as well as i do decisions
made in real time are never perfect.
don't second-guess an
operation from an armchair.
i'll see you at the office.
enjoy your egg whites.
(man chattering on pa)
vosen: people!
this is pamela landy
and her associate, tom cronin.
she's gonna be quarterbacking
the search effort.
say your names.
state your specs, please.
well, let’s do names later, okay?
what's bourne's last fixed position?
jimmy: london, 1200 zulu.
status. what is he?
armed? wounded?
jimmy: alive, mobile and unknown.
do we have an echelon package?
woman: yes.
why isn't it on?
we were waiting.
waiting? for what?
what... listen,
people, do you have any idea
who you're dealing with?
this is jason bourne.
you are nine hours behind the
toughest target you have ever tracked.
now, i want everyone to sit down,
strap in and turn on all you've got.
that would mean now!
thank you.
give me a team
deployment plan.
i want everything you got
on ross on screen one.
(calling bell sounding)
brian: sir, i think we have something.
we just hacked ross' e-mail
account at the guardian.
found a round-trip ticket
to turin, italy, yesterday.
i think we can be pretty certain
that bourne's not your source, then.
how?
ross's call to his editor where
he said he'd just met the source
took place just after
his turin flight landed.
- he met his source in turin.
- so?
what? so, what? bourne met
ross in turin for breakfast
and then at noon the same day bourne
calls ross to demand a meet at waterloo?
maybe they were even
on the same flight.
pull up everything you've got.
cross-check the secure cell phone
usage of everyone with sci clearance
against all calls going in and out of
turin, italy, the morning ross was there.
this guy you're after is a cia operative
with clearance above top secret.
he's committing treason
by talking to ross.
do you really think
while doing that
he's gonna use a cell phone
that he knows we can track?
zero results
on the cross-check.
so, you got any better ideas?
yeah, look at all the people
whose cell phones were switched off
the entire period
ross was in turin.
i mean, if your people are on
their phones as much as mine,
the list should
be pretty small.
three names. tom brewster,
jack boulin and neal daniels.
okay, now check everything in
ross' apartment against those names.
check for common patterns.
look for anything that
indicates who ross met.
pull up his socials.
pull it up.
see those documents?
cronin: break it.
over here. what is that?
all right. right there. initials.
pull that up.
bring that up on main.
neal daniels.
he's station chief
in madrid, isn't he?
yeah.
all right, call the rso at the embassy.
have them take daniels
into custody, if he is there.
anna, get grab teams
to the calle norte safe house.
send them in heavy. tell them
we'll assist with the entry.
heavy? daniels isn't
really that much of a...
i'm worried about bourne.
if he is not the source,
then he is after the source,
the same as we are.
(beeping)
eta, team two.
three minutes
to destination, sir.
<i>your mission will save american lives.</i>
(bourne panting)
<i>really give yourself
to this program.</i>
<i>i can't.</i>
<i>you can.</i>
(breathing heavily)
(helicopter flying overhead)
(dog barking)
sir, they're at
the front door.
five seconds.
put it up live.
kiley: we're in.
the alarm's down.
that's gotta be bourne.
the safe is empty.
shit.
looks like he left in a hurry.
track daniels' passports.
stand by.
(whispering) hammond.
god damn it!
get a backup team in there!
(grunting)
(door buzzing)
(helicopter flying overhead)
get me a secure line in there.
get the second team over there now!
(panting)
what are you doing here?
i was posted
here after berlin.
where's daniels?
where is he?
(phone ringing)
(phone continues ringing)
hello?
who is this?
this is nicky parsons.
she was treadstone. logistics.
she was with us when
we hunted bourne in berlin.
nicky, i need to
do an id challenge.
code in, sparrow.
response, everest.
nicky, this is noah vosen.
how long have you been on-site?
i just walked in.
we have two officers on-site.
are you in contact with them?
they're down.
unconscious but alive.
any sign of neal daniels?
no.
nicky, this is pam landy.
we have reason to believe
there's a connection between
neal daniels and jason bourne.
bourne? you're still looking for bourne?
i thought that case was closed.
no, some people are convinced
he's still a threat.
i disagree, but to find out
i need to talk to him.
hold on, nicky.
what the hell are you doing?
i'm trying to send him a message.
you don't think bourne is a threat?
he just took out two more of my men.
the only way this has
a happy ending, noah,
is if we bring him in alive.
he is going after daniels.
he wants revenge, pam,
and the only realistic way
to end this is to
eliminate the threat.
how long until backup?
nicky, i need you to stay put
and secure the premises.
backup will be arriving in
approximately one hour. do you copy?
nicky: copy, sir.
(phone beeping)
how long do i have?
three minutes.
my car's outside.
i know where daniels is.
(operator speaking in spanish)
(speaking spanish)
come on.
two minutes
to destination, sir.
wills: grab teams a and b...
where was daniels headed?
at 8:00 this morning, he wired
$100,000 to a bank account in tangier.
right, that's 300 miles away. if we
hurry, we can make the morning ferry.
where are you parked?
to the right, 20 meters,
north side of the street.
(police sirens blaring)
they're coming.
keep moving.
man: two subjects seen
exiting safe house.
(sirens blaring)
what the hell is this?
man: wait, wait, wait!
no, no, no!
what the hell just happened?
we've lost visual contact
with the subjects, sir.
christ!
issue a standing kill order on
jason bourne, effective immediately.
send out a system one alert
to all spanish contacts.
i want all air and ground
border exits locked down.
what's going on?
what's daniels got?
what's operation blackbriar?
do you want to tell me, or
should i call kramer and ask him?
for christ's sake, pam, we're
in the middle of an operation.
bullshit.
you want jason bourne,
level with me.
operation blackbriar started
as an neat surveillance program.
and what is it now?
it is now the umbrella program
for all our black ops.
full envelope intrusion, rendition,
experimental interrogation
is all run out of this office.
we are the sharp end
of the stick now, pam.
lethal action?
if we have to, sure.
that's what makes us special.
no more red tape.
no more getting the bad guys
caught in our sights,
then watching them escape
while we wait for someone in
washington to issue the order.
oh, come on.
you've seen the raw intel, pam.
you know how real the danger is.
we need these programs now.
what's the connection
to daniels?
he ran all of our operations in
southern europe and north africa,
so he has everything.
names, dates, ghost sites,
who's cooperating with us abroad.
every operation.
you want that stuff in bourne's hands,
out on the market to the highest bidder?
i don't think so.
bourne's not after money.
he's after daniels for a reason.
well, what does it matter
what bourne is after?
when we find daniels, and,
believe me, we’ll find him,
if you're right,
we get bourne, too.
(door closing)
(thunder rumbling)
why did you come back?
why are you looking for daniels?
do you know who that is?
that's daniels.
i don't know who that is.
who is he?
he was there
at the beginning.
i remember meeting him.
the first day.
daniels brought me to him.
that's where it all
started for me.
something happened to me
and i need to know what it was
or i'll never be free of this.
daniels said the training
was experimental.
behavior modification.
they had to break down the agents
before they became operational.
he said you
were the first one.
why are you helping me?
it was difficult for me
with you.
you really don't
remember anything.
no.
(door opening)
we have to move.
(computer beeping)
sir? mr. wills? you're gonna
want to look at this.
(dialing)
wills: he's in tangier.
noah vosen.
we have found daniels.
they've just tracked daniels'
passport to a hotel in tangier.
they're holding up a bank transfer
he made to keep him in place
while they bring an asset
up from casablanca.
they're gonna take him out.
(intercom beeping)
yeah.
woman: it's pam landy.
she says it's urgent.
tell her i'm unavailable.
yes, sir.
brian: sir, asset has
arrived at the airport.
(speaking in arabic)
give me the
subject's location.
man: subject is now on foot
and entering hotel velasquez.
hotel is 2.2 kilometers
from the bank.
aii right, get an elevation
and a floor plan, tic-tac-toe.
locate the room.
give the asset
subject location
and the route between the
subject's hotel and the bank.
(phone ringing)
vosen: do we have that room yet?
man: yes, sir. it's room 117.
aii right, get a hold
of the hotel trunk line.
run all calls through here
with an iso on room 117.
his location's being
blocked by the firewall.
no, they found daniels.
they know where he is.
they'll get one of the
operatives to terminate him.
find out who.
nicky: desh.
tell him you're gonna meet him
and you have a new phone for him.
if you stop desh,
they'll just get someone else.
no, we're not gonna stop him,
we're gonna follow him.
he'll take us
right to daniels.
(phone ringing)
sir, the asset is
deviating off course.
let it play.
(cars honking)
asset unscheduled stop.
sir, asset is on the move
en route to subject.
wills: sir, we have
an unauthorized breach.
someone with active system
knowledge penetrated our protocol.
instructions were sent to
the asset at 1411 local time.
trace is confirmed and valid.
it came from a computer
belonging to nicky parsons.
where did the
course deviation occur?
south to rue de belgique,
stationary place de france.
that's where parsons is.
when we're finished with
daniels, send the asset after her.
man: yes, sir.
we find parsons,
we find bourne.
noah, what are you doing?
not now.
i wanna know what's going on.
i said not now!
what basis are you continuing
this operation on?
on the basis that nicky parsons
has compromised a covert operation.
she is up to her neck in this!
this is about daniels,
not nicky!
she has betrayed us.
you don't know
the circumstances, noah.
she's in league with jason
bourne, for christ's sakes!
you do not have the
authority to kill her!
oh, yes, i do. and you
had better get on board.
noah, she's one of us.
you start down this path,
where does it end?
it ends when we've won.
when we're finished with daniels,
send the asset after them.
yes, sir.
man 1: okay, come on.
man 2: stand by...
(phone ringing)
two minutes, sir.

tell the bank
to release the funds.
(phone ringing)

(woman speaking french)

(tires screeching)
woman: on it, sir.
man 1: two hundred meters.

sir? asset confirms
both targets are down.
(telephone beeping)
i want to be sure
about this.
ask the station chief from
rabat to confirm the deaths
and do a sub-rosa
collection of the bodies.
i want to tie this thing off completely.
and keep an eye on landy.
(beeping)
yeah?
vosen:
bourne and nicky parsons are dead.
you sure about that?
our station chief
in rabat is confirming.
i can't afford to have this
come back to me.
don't worry.
you're protected.
just remember
why we put landy there.
if blackbriar goes south,
we'll roll it up, hang it
around her neck and start over.
(people chattering in arabic)
i can see their faces.
everyone i ever killed.
i just don't know
their names.
marie used to try to
help me remember the names.
i've tried to
apologize for...
for what i've done.
for what i am.
none of it
makes it any better.
they're gonna
come for you again.
you're gonna
have to run now.
we should go.
it gets easier.
(speaking french)
(speaking french)
(knocking)
station chief in rabat just called.
they found a body.
- bourne?
- desh.
pam. you need to see this.
a passport for gilberto de
piento just cleared immigration.
it's an early treadstone identity
registered to jason bourne,
but he never used it, and
it never went to the grid.
bourne's alive.
they don't know?
well, if they knew, vosen wouldn't
be in his office right now.
it's a hell of a risk.
maybe bourne wants
us to know.
just like naples.
maybe he's communicating.
maybe he's trying to
communicate with you.
then we should
communicate back.
i think i know what
bourne's looking for.
(woman chattering on pa)
man on pa:
gilberto de piento.
gilberto de piento.
your party
is waiting for you.
(cell phone vibrating)
pamela landy.
i hear you're still
looking for me.
bourne?
what do you want?
(telephone beeping)
yeah?
wills over intercom:
better get in here.
we got a situation.
i...
i wanted to thank you
for the tape.
landy on speaker:
it's all tied off. it's over.
i guess i owe you
an apology.
is that official?
no. off the record.
you know how it is.
you tracing this?
man: fifty seconds to trace.
goodbye.
wait. wait.
david webb.
that's your real name.
you were born 4/15/71
in nixa, missouri.
why don't you come in
and we'll talk about it?
something is very wrong here.
bourne?
get some rest, pam.
you look tired.
he's looking right at her.
people, listen up!
this is a national security emergency.
we have an imminent threat.
i'm going out there.
if i show myself,
he'll find me.
jason bourne is alive and
is at large in new york city,
and, we believe, within
i want an immediate 12-block
lockdown of the area.
send a flash message
to langley.
prep for local backup
assistance.
landy just left
the building!
stay with her phone.
she's using her cell.
there's an incoming text.
- get it.
- man: working on it, sir.
how many do we have
on landy?
six men.
more on the way.
i've got it, sir! coming
up on the screen now.
anybody not on landy goes
directly to tudor city.
get the vehicles.
we're going mobile.
team two. team two.
all teams, call in.
(cell phone ringing)
there's only one way out of
there. why would he do that?
he's trapping himself.
it's a bad place to meet.
it's too exposed.
he wouldn't have chosen it
if he didn't have a reason.
subject is en route.
man: roof 43, let me
know when you have visual.
roof 43, standing by.
standing by.
okay, folks, here we go.
box 200 meters.
visual on leader.
as soon as you have eyes
on landy, i wanna know.
okay, here we go.
copy that. i see her.
any sign of bourne?
man: negative.
man 2: no sign of target.
(cell phone beeping)
noah vosen.
this is jason bourne.
i was wondering when you
were going to make this call.
how did you
get this number?
you didn't actually think i was
coming to tudor city, did you?
no, i guess not.
but if it's me
you want to talk to,
perhaps we can
arrange a meet.
where are you now?
i'm sitting in my office.
i doubt that.
and why would
you doubt that?
if you were
in your office right now,
we'd be having this
conversation face to face.
(on recorder) noah vosen.
this is a code ten abort.
i want everyone back in the
vehicles. this is a code ten abort.
man: let's go! let's go!
(phone rings)
yeah?
wills, check my office.
(people chattering)
damn it!
vosen: what's going on?
we need building security
up here.
he's got everything.
god damn it!
all right, set a four-block
perimeter around the building.
man: somebody give me a visual.
i want the entire building
searched.
every room, every hallway, every
closet, every goddamn air duct.
you understand?
i want him found!
(tires screeching)
what just happened?
bourne just broke into cri.
he got into vosen's safe.
(sighs)
where to?
four-fifteen-seventy-one?
jesus, pam.
target in sight.
north on eighth.
he's headed east
in the port authority.
all agents have shoot-on-sight authorization.
(man chattering on pa)
right there!
(car alarm blaring)
sir, he drove off the roof.
what?
he drove off the roof!
he's on foot.
he's running.
(alarm sounding)
police! freeze!
put your hands
in the air!
call for backup!
sir, sir, take a look at this!
bourne's birthday, sir.
- what about it?
- check that out.
sir, landy told bourne that
his birthday was 4/15/71.
oh, my god. it's a code.
everything stops.
everything stops! listen up!
new assignment, numbers.
what does it mean?
give me encryption codes!
sir, if you plug them in as
variables of longitude and latitude
you get cameroon.
for varney, kentucky.
what date did she give him?
wills: 4/15/71.
i don't believe it.
srd is at 415
east 71st street.
she just gave him
the training facility.
oh, christ.
bring all the teams
in behind us.
(siren wailing)
hurry up!
somebody call 911!
woman: help him!
(sirens wailing)
wills:
the asset lost bourne.
we lost him.
(telephone ringing)
hello?
albert, it's vosen.
bourne knows everything and
he's on his way to you right now.
he's coming home, noah.
how long do i have?
i don't know.
just get the hell
out of there.
no, i'm gonna stay.
he'll head for the training wing.
that's what he knows.
i'll keep him in play
till you get there.
they'll kill you for giving me this.
much of a code.
my guess is vosen
is on his way already.
why'd you do it?
because this isn't
what i signed up for,
what they did to you, blackbriar.
this isn't us.
then do something about it.
everything you need is in there.
everything.
david. why don't
you come in with me?
it'll be better
if we do this together.
no.
this is where
it started for me.
this is where it ends.
that's landy.
woman on pa: mandy aaron,
dial extension 200, please.
mandy aaron,
dial extension 200.
all right,
lock this building down.
set a secure perimeter
of one block.
hello. this is pamela landy.
i have to send a classified document.
get a team to srd
after bourne.
and put someone in every
public area of this hospital.
okay. elevator shafts,
service entrances, go!
(alarm sounding)
damn it! south bay! go!
gentlemen, this is
a priority one situation!
you will give us
your full cooperation.
give me playback for the entire
building for the last three minutes.
yes, sir.
move! move!
this one, here!
where is this?
first floor.
i'll take landy on my own.
(fax machine whirring)
(fax machine beeps)
you better get yourself
a good lawyer.
(beeps)
dr. hirsch: a republic
lives on the knife's edge.
when we are finished with you,
you will no longer be david webb.
you may not even
remember who he was.
(voice echoing)
you know why we're
treating you like this?
hello, jason.
(gun cocking)
i believe you've been
having some problems.
put the gun down.
i wouldn't be here
if i didn't want to talk.
i've spent three years
running.
three years trying
to find out who i am.
you've still not got it
all back, have you?
still not filled in
the pieces.
it was always you.
i'm unarmed, jason.
why me? why did you pick me?
your really don't remember,
do you?
we didn't pick you.
you picked us.
you volunteered.
right here.
even after you were warned.
(lock clicking)
<i>captain webb.</i>
<i>good morning, captain.</i>
you came in here.
you didn't even blink, jason.
you just handed me these.
<i>dr. hirsch: has everything
been explained to you?</i>
<i>yes, sir.</i>
you said you wanted to serve.
<i>your missions will save
american lives.</i>
<i>webb: i understand, sir.</i>
you said i'd be
saving american lives.
you were.
i was killing for you.
for them.
you knew exactly what it meant
for you if you chose to stay.
<i>when we are finished with you,
you will no longer be david webb.</i>
<i>i'll be whoever
you need me to be, sir.</i>
you can't outrun
what you did, jason.
you made yourself
into who you are.
eventually you're gonna
have to face the fact
you chose right here
to become jason bourne.
<i>dr. hirsch: you haven't
slept for a long time.</i>
<i>have you made a decision?</i>
<i>this can't go on.</i>
<i>you have to decide.</i>
<i>who is he?</i>
<i>we've been through that.</i>
<i>what did he do?</i>
<i>it doesn't matter.</i>
<i>you came to us.</i>
<i>you volunteered.</i>
<i>you said you'd do anything it takes to</i>
<i>save american lives.</i>
<i>you're not a liar, are you?</i>
<i>or too weak</i>
<i>to see this through?</i>
<i>this is it.</i>
<i>let go of david webb.</i>
<i>really give yourself
to this program.</i>
(shells clinking)
<i>you're no longer</i>
<i>david webb.</i>
<i>from now on, you'll be
known as jason bourne.</i>
<i>welcome to the program.</i>
do you remember now?
i remember.
i remember everything.
i'm no longer jason bourne.
so now you're gonna kill me.
no.
you don't deserve the star they'd
give you on the wall at langley.
(banging)
man: he's headed for the roof!
(clanging)
(sirens wailing)
(gun cocking)
why didn't
you take the shot?
do you even know why
you're supposed to kill me?
look at us.
look at what
they make you give.
