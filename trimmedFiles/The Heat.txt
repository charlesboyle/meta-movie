okay...
huh?
oh, my god, it means:
"cover me, go left. "
read the manual,
why don't you?
wait for my three count.
and one, two...
unbelievable.
don't move! get 'em up!
on your head!
surprise.
we've checked everywhere.
there's nothing.
well, place is clean, ashburn.
looks like your theory
has a few holes in it.
let's roll, boys.
so you think it's clean, huh?
oh, here we go.
that's what they said last year
right before i arrested
the red falls killer.
what are those?
barbecue spareribs?
is that what that is?
i don't know. maybe i'm wrong.
or...
...maybe i'm not.
yeah. airtight.
dipped in wax.
i respect that.
i especially like the meat
to distract the dog.
and while that may have fooled
the loudest breather
in the world,
it did not fool me.
and, unfortunately,
it's not what i'm looking for.
so why don't we
just cut to the chase?
are there guns
in this house?
i don't know anything
about any guns.
interesting.
maybe i'm wrong. you know?
mm, wait for it.
maybe these guys are...
are right for a change.
stranger things have
happened, right, guys?
mm, that's a trap.
meteors, comets.
somebody married pete,
and he can't even
count to three.
see? right there?
so frustrating.
you know,
they loved these houses
during the prohibition era.
you guys know what
prohibition is, don't you?
yeah, selling
your ass for money?
really?
no. no, it was, uh, alcohol.
people loved to drink it, even
though they weren't supposed to,
and these houses
had all these little
nooks and crannies
where they could hide it.
like this one.
is there something behind me?
there is, isn't there?
fuck.
now you can roll.
gentlemen.
nice work, dick.
jesus.
let's go. ooh...
hard to believe she's single.
oh!
immediately below that,
you feel a little crease...
wow, that's pretty
impressive, huh?
do you see that?
look at that.
we'd want to make an incision
right through there.
that's pretty amazing, huh?
pretty amazing.
pumpkin!
here, kitty, kitty.
are you at the
neighbor's again?
pumpkin!
here, kitty, kitty.
go on home.
i'll see you tomorrow.
there you go.
pumpkin, i told you
to stay away from
that weird lady.
yo, taxi!
mmhmm.
<i>no, no, no,
o  lo  lo... lo siento.</i>
<i>no, hay a poder
llegar temprano,</i>
<i>llamar de los vecinos
y diles que...</i>
<i>lo siento. perdã³n.</i>
oh, boy.
wife doesn't like you
working late, huh?
what do you want?
oh, just, uh, letting you know
that i have been
observing the agents,
overseeing what
they've been up to,
you know,
keeping an eye on them.
yeah. supervising.
supervising. yes, sir.
look, ashburn...
i haven't made
any decisions yet.
oh... of course not.
every...
everyone deserves a shot.
i don't know if you are the
right person for this position.
i'm s... i'm sorry, what?
what? i'm confused.
walk with me.
sir, i don't...
i don't understand.
i've closed more cases
than any agent here.
should i not have
done that?
you are a solid agent.
there are many other
solid agents.
well, none of them
have closed
the red falls killer case.
ashburn, it's no secret
that none of the other agents
like you.
what?
i've gotten countless
complaints of arrogance
and competitiveness,
showmanship.
just give it a rest.
all right.
we've got a situation in boston.
the feds picked up chatter
on a guy moving in.
simon larkin.
we don't know
what he looks like,
where he comes
from, nothing.
we believe this guy is doing
the legwork for him.
julian vincent,
nasty son of a bitch.
murder, extortion.
this is his m.o.
the problem with guys
like that is that
everyone's too scared to talk.
pack your bags.
i'm sending you to boston.
you know how to get
inside people's heads.
you want to find larkin,
get to julian.
you do well with this,
we can talk about the job.
? whoo!
? she's got stickers
on her locker ?
? and the boy's number's there
in magic marker ?
? i'm hungry
and the hunger will linger ?
? i eat 16 saltine crackers
? then i lick my fingers
? well, every morning
i deliver the news ?
? black hat, white shoes...
hey, rojas sent me over.
he said you were really nice.
yeah, baby,
what are you looking for?
what's your name?
champaz?
did your mom give you that name?
not exactly.
hey, mullins.
captain wants to know
when you're coming in.
hey, you know what?
tell him i'll be there
sharply at, uh,
gofuckyourself o'clock.
okay? if there's no traffic.
thank you.
that seems kind of expensive.
can you break a hundred?
i got a hundred right here.
no, baby, i'm not
going to break a hundred.
all right, let me see.
i don't think i have that.
wow.
my god, do you have,
like, a discount?
hey, what's going on here?
okay, i don't want
any drugs, all right?
oh.
no. hi. how you doing?
are you trying to get a...
a deal on my girl here?
are you her pimp?
no, we're just friends.
isn't that right?
okay, well, it's... i think
this is just kind of...
between her and i, so let's...
am i kind of invading
your space here?
kind of.
let me see if this
will help you.
all right, look,
i... i just wanted to...
oh.
well, it... it's, uh...
it's a good thing i didn't
get the drugs from you.
yeah, can you imagine that?
that would have been...
that would have been bad.
yeah, right?
whew!
you'd better wipe that brow.
listen, um...
i got to ask,
you know, whatever...
what was... what was
actually going on here?
oh, we were just, um...
she looked kind of sad,
so i just...
i kind of thought i'd help her
out and give her a ride home.
that's nice, like
a good samaritan.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
was he giving you
a ride home?
yeah, i was kind of
cheering you up.
yeah, good for you.
you know who else is pretty
sad? frank over here.
right, frank, you get sad 'cause
you shit and piss yourself?
you having a sad day,
frank?
hey, maybe you can put him
in the back of your car...
you want to shit and piss
all over this guys car?
you know what,
let's open up the...
frank, you want to shit your
pants and get in the...
oh, good, it's open.
i can put, uh, frank in there.
he can shit and piss himself...
...until he's happy.
i got some towels.
i can put some towels...

why don't you let me see your i.d. there?
um...  yeah, hey, let me just
take the whole thing.
i don't...  yeah, it's good.
it's... i got it.
oh, good.
you know what?
i got nervous that maybe
you didn't have
a wife and a whole bunch
of kids, but...
but luckily, you do.
what's your wife's name?
her name is bella.
oh, bella. good.
hey, can i borrow
your phone for a minute?
my... yeah, my...
my battery's out.
why do you want
to borrow my phone?
because i asked you
for your phone.

shut your mouth.
can't you just, like,
g  give me one chance here?
yeah, i'll give you one chance.
hello?
yeah, who's this?

no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!
that's... don't do that.

ow! my god!
yes, this is officer mullins.
i'm here with your husband.
god, what are you, spock?
no.
no, he's not been in
an accident, unfortunately.
i just, uh... ii do have him
here with a known prostitute.
god! she's lying!
bella, she's lying!
oh, that's not
the first time, huh?
god.
he's crying 'cause i'm
breaking his fucking hand.
god.
all right, bella.
ow! god!
well, you got to go with
your instincts, bella.
yep, you're welcome.
yep, she's probably going to
burn your shit today, so...
come on, look, you don't
understand, all right?
she just had a baby. there's
a lot going on down there.
i'm not going to touch that.
seat belt off for a minute?
oh, come on, please... come on.
no, you seem like
a reasonable guy.
you look like you got...
take your fucking belt off.
and you look like
you got some compassion.
listen, i love... i love
the sound of a guy that,
after his wife gives him
his fifth fucking child,
complains about
her messy vagina.
and then you don't want
to fucking touch her!
get out of the fucking car.
what the fuck, man?
get out of the fucking car!
come on!
what is your problem?
you asked for my phone...
turn around.
you want to do that?
do you want to do that?
good! i hope it burns
your fucking dick off!
hey, it's rojas,
my favorite asshole.
yeah, look what i found.
oh, no, did i take some
of your business away?
that's a real shame.

what you're talking about.
i just stand on this corner,
and i just do
my "sodukas," okay?
oh, is that right? first of all,
it's "soduko," dumbass.
and you want to tell me
that you're
just here coincidentally,
right in the...
right in the middle
of all the prostitutes?
lady, tell me this...
why are you so obsessed with me?
you should be ashamed
of yourself,
trying to break down
a successful black man.
you racist?
and don't play that race
bullshit card with me!
nine out of ten guys i fuck
are black guys.
lady, what i think
you need to do...
you need to go down the road,

special agent sarah ashburn.
we got intel recently
that you brought in
a dealer by the name
of terrell rojas.
uh, yeah, but detective mullins
isn't back from lunch yet.
i'm sure he won't mind.
well, he's a she, and we're not
really allowed to go
near her collars.
let me tell you what i think.
i think that every second
we're standing here
is interfering with
the federal investigation.
so, if you'd be so kind
as to show mr. rojas
to an interrogation room.
thank you.
special agent?
this way.
special agent?
special agent?
shit.
you are looking at
possession with intent,
which is a class d drug charge,
chapter 94c, section 32a.
i had a joint and a few
little bags of coke.
since when is that shit illegal?
the answer to your question
is always.
and with your priors,
you are looking at 25 years
and some pretty stiff fines.
who the hell cares about fines?
that's 25 years!
never mind.
let's see what
you make of these.
huh? what do you
make of these?
what i make of them is
that somebody doesn't want
somebody else selling
on their turf.
but you're still here.
and you're alive.
why is that?
who you working for?
who you working for?
who you working for?  nobody.
nobody! if i tell you,
that's my ass
chopped up into a million
motherfucking pieces!
goddamn it.
fucker.
god.

everybody's got to fucking park
in my spot.
goddamn it!
shit!
suitwearing, god...
ow! fuck!
god.
yeah, i said i'm...
fucking parking there.
that doesn't...
steal my goddamn fucking space.
i don't want you to do time.
i don't want you to get
chopped up into little, tiny,
mothereffin' pieces.
oh.
i can protect you.
i can.
but you got,
you got to help me.
i can help you.
you're gonna help me?
tell me where i can find julian.
i don't deal with him like that.
i get my stuff from this bitch
named tatiana on newkirk avenue.
can you describe her to me?
well, she got brown eyes.
mm, she got some
bigass "breastses. "
big breastses.
can you maybe be a
little bit more specific?
uh... like...
her breastses is like this.
okay. thank you.
that's a shame.
don't.
oh, haha, oh, yeah!
we're at a comedy party, yeah.
move the fuck
out of my way.

tim, you still owe me 40.
yeah, tomorrow it's 60.
fucking dickweed.
why is the cage empty?
what have i told you
about moving my prisoners?
he's in interrogation.
why would he be in interrogation
when i'm standing right here?
theythey came and got him.
who's "they"?
better be two of me.
is it two of me?
it was a lady. she was...
i'm a lady.
did i come and get him?
no, no, it was a different lady;
she was nice.
i'm fuckin' nice.
why was she nice to you?
she made me give her the keys.
i'm gonna make you
fucking bend over,
and i'm gonna reach up your ass
into your pocket and get
the keys to your house.
and then i'm gonna
drive there,
come in your front fucking door
and kill you in your sleep.
i think i have a clear idea
of what we're looking for,
and i appreciate
your time.
wow, lady, you're on
a real fuckin' roll.
excuse me? i...
yeah, no, i won't excuse you.
i just spent the last 30 minutes
thinking of different ways
to kill you.
i... i'm... i'm sorry,
when did we meet?
what is this, your lawyer?
i'm...  what are you,
insurance salesman?
do you sell those shitty suits?
i'm special agent sarah ashburn.
how can i help you?
you can get all of that,
get it up,
and get it the fuck out of here,
'cause this is my room.
were you, were you about to be,
uh, questioned by a detective?
i am a detective,
and that's my perp.
ah, i... i understand now.
well, um, detective,
mr. rojas will be continuing on
with me at this point.
no.
it's a jurisdictional issue.
no, not gonna happen.
areare duly noted. thank
you so much.  oh, great.
and if you're okay
with everything,
could you justjust
maybe close the door
on the way out?
i'll shut the door on you.
will you lay down here
and put your head in the door?
and i'll slam it about
aw, shit, girl, you better run.
you need to shut your mouth.
run like you on fire.
you need to be quiet.
you're gonna get up,
and we're gonna
settle this outside.
okay, now i'm...
i won't be going outside.
you're gonna get up and
you're gonna come outside.
no, ma'am. not going outside.
fine. we'll do this inside.
can somebody please
remove this person
from the interrogation room?
mental illness is
nothing to be ashamed of.
it runs in many families.
i'm gonna hit you.
you're not gonna hit me.
please don't.
i'm gonna hit you and knock
all your little buttons.
do not point your finger...
i'm gonna hit you there...
no, do not put your
finger in my...
stop touching my buttons,
stop touching...
well, stop wearing buttons.
don't you...  don't you move
those fucking hands again.
i'll get that stupid barrette.
h  hey, hey!
i'll take that barrette
right out of your fucking hair!
hey, stop!
oh, stop, stop, stop!
hey, both of you, my office now.
nope. not in there.
there is nothing
i can do, mullins.
the fbi has jurisdiction.
maybe they're in here. maybe
they're in here.  aw, come on.
nope.
nope, they're not in
there. let me see.
what is she doing?
she's looking for my balls.
oh.
hey, if anyone sees
the captain's balls,
let me know!
they're about this big,
but a lot tinier.
they're like a pea,
or like a, like a ball bearing,
or like, if you've ever
seen a mouse ball,
about half that size.
incredibly tiny.
they're like really, really
tiny, little girl balls,
if little girls had balls.
so if you find
little, tiny, girl balls
that are so fucking tiny
and shriveled up, let me know,
'cause i'll put them
right back up his scrotum!
knock it off, mullins.
how about you
do something for once?
what do you want me to do?!
uh, i'd like you to have my back
and stop being so goddamn
disappointing like
everybody else.
oh, well, that was professional.
oh, is that not professional?
here.
let me, let me be professional.
let me help you
pick up your bag.
that's very mature.
let me just
straighten that shit up.
oh, wait, hey, hey!
good news! good news!
i found his balls!
yeah, in a clear sack!
yeah, enjoy that.
shove those
back up there.
cop of the year!

uh, uh, 58?
i'm 43 years old.
mmhmm, mmhmm.
well, i always,
see, i always round up.
i have a fiveyearold son
who calls me grandpa.
so, uh, anywho,
uh, sir, if, um...
if you could just, you know,
keep her away from me,
that would be...
be very helpful.
she stole your keys, didn't she?
yes, she did. do you know
where i can find her?
she's probably at o'flanagan's.
it's a bar down the street.
now, it's a little divey.
you might want to wear a vest.
? okay, i'm rambo, i ramshack

you are so concerned about
taking down a guy like rojas
when we have just wasted
all this time, when i could
have stopped a drug lord
who is far more dangerous and
supplies to people like rojas.
bullshit.
who?
okay, you want to
see some bull feces?
i think i said bullshit,
is what i said.
here you go. here's

sorry, very sorry.
wait a minute,
this is a bar.
this is a b...
no, absolutely not.
nononononono.
nonononono.
why do i not know
who simon larkin is?
uh, that would
probably be because
the fbi knows
more than you do.
uh, anything that's happening
in my neighborhood,
i have a right to know.
uh, no, you actually don't.
you want to know.
and you do not have the
clearance that would allow you
to read everything
that is on this file, okay?
okay, all right!
you know,
when bad shit happens
in my neighborhood, i get
a little passionate about it.
i shouldn't have
read your files.
i went too far.
well, i... i accept
your apology.
but you need to understand
that this is a highly
important case
and the information is
highly, highly sensitive.
therefore, we have these
clearances that mean...
i don't have the clearances.
i don't have the
clearances, right?
i mean, you're...
you are, wow, fbi.
yes.
you're a goddamn
angel of the law.
well, i... that's a little...
you know, i want you to spread
those wings out and just soar.
while i appreciate
the sentiment...
hey!
...it's certainly not...
watch it.
you watch it.
i'm a federal agent.
oh, yeah?
well, guess what, you dick.
i'm a federal agent, too.
i work at the post office.

you're my goddamn brother;
i know when you're lying.
i'm just a lowlevel guy.
okay? i heard of larkin, but,
you know, i never met him.
yeah, well,
he's a goddamn animal,
and i'm trying to keep him
from meeting you.

yeah, i might.

oh, okay, that's hilarious.
yeah, okay,
you know what's not funny?
that you stole
a confidential fbi case file.
oh, that's funny,
i don't remember any of that.
i'm gonna say this
one more time.
stand down, officer.
fuck off, officer.
oh, okay, guess what?
now you've really done it.
i'm gonna call my boss.
yeah, you do that,
tattle tits!
fucking narc!
unbelievable.
unbelievable.
hale.
it's ashburn, sir.
i'm gonna need authorization
to suspend a police officer
from my investigation, sir.
ashburn, why is working
with local authorities
a problem for you?
i understand how this might
sound coming from me,
but i... i think this individual
might actually be
mentally unstable.
according to her captain,
she grew up on those streets
and she knows them
better than anyone.
that seems like an asset
to our investigation.
nonono.
just work with her.
just show me you can do this
or forget the promotion.
well, sir, no need, no need
to take someone's badge.
i think i can, uh...
i think i can work
something out, sir.
all right.
thank you.
byebye.
you know, uh...
i just, i think just...
i think you and i
got off on the wrong foot.
oh.
and you obviously have
a  a lot of resources
and a lot of knowledge about
the area thatthat could be,
you know, could be useful.
probably very.
so, uh, maybe we can
work together on this.
yeah, i don't need your help
to take down larkin.
you know, you wouldn't even
have known about larkin
if it wasn't for me,
so obviously the fbi can
get information
that you can't, okay?
and there's a lot more
where that comes from... a lot.
maybe i just need
to hear a little
"i need your help, mullins. "
no, i won't be doing that.
okay, well, get your ass
back in your car.
okay, this is ridiculous, okay?
i'm an fbi agent,
you're a police officer.
it's not...
"i need your help,
mullins. "
i need your help, mullins.
oh, god, what is...
is this a whisper party?
i want that third floor
to hear it.
"i need your help, mullins. "
and then maybe give me
a little echo on that "mullins. "
i need your help, mullins!
mullins, mullins...
just move, move, move!
god.
even in that,
you're annoying.
i will work with you,
as long as we're clear
that this is my case.
that's actually not correct.
this isn't your...  awesome.
glad you see it my way.
careful of the car.
goddamn it.
stand down.
if you just, if you just let go.
i think i have it, just...
just let me...
i got it.
oh, shit.
ma'am, you, uh...
just go. just go.
okay, now let me
take the lead on this.
i'm a trained interviewer.
what are you,
fucking barbara walters?
i just thought we were
gonna go in there
and bring in some heat on her.
i'm sorry, w  what is...
what does that even mean?
what does that mean?
me and you, we're the heat.
we go in there,
we interrogate her,
we scare the shit
out of her...
see, we don't say
"interrogation. "
it's, it's much
too aggressive.
rule number one: catch more
with sugar than a stick.
that's a horrible
fucking saying.
okay, well, what we like to
do isis create aa genuine
personal interest
in the subject,
allowing them to open up.
but from then, i'm going to...
oh, god.  ... uh, perform instant
personality assessments
based on the
myersbriggs theory, uh,
thematic apperception
tests, and a few...
well, a few others i won't,
i won't bore you with.
oh, my god, well, that's...
i am balls deep in boredom.
all right,
as long as you don't do
that whole goddamn
long explanation again,
we'll try it your way first.
only 'cause you're older.
oh, my god.
tatiana krumova.
i'm special agent
sarah ashburn,
and this is detective mullins.
detective mullins.
and we'd like to ask
you a few questions,
if you could give us a moment.
oh, shoot, you know, now is bad.
oh.
oh. oh, that's...
how about other time?
well, if you could...
how's that? how's that?
right fucking now.
well, tatiana, thank you.
this is,
this is very kind of you.
so...
how long have you lived here?
i've lived here
since i moved in.
shit.
okay, that's very,
very helpful.
okay, we'll get a
little more specific.
uh, what do you do
for a living?
i know what this asshole
does for a living.
what you know, asshole?
okay, sugar, no stick.
it is bulgarian, is it not?
no, i'm fucking french.
oh, jesus.
tatiana...
i don't understand
what you're saying.
nice bullshit bulgarian.
okay, you know what?
that was perfect bulgarian.
i mean, i don't understand
what you're talking about.
why i go to jail
when i don't do shits?
ah, okay.
so she did understand
what i was saying,
she just didn't understand
the context
in which i said it to her.
okay, okay, all right,
rosetta stone, you're done.
god.
oh, jesus.
how many porns have been
made on this couch?
oh, this couch
not of your satisfaction?
you're not comfy?
i'll get comfy.
when my foot's up your ass.
wow.
that'll make me really comfy.
don't poke me.
don't poke me.
listen, tatiana,
i want to get really real.
you ready to get
real, tatiana?
let's get real.
okay, we both
know you've been
blowing shit
up your nose all day.
man, i get it.
there's nothing more
i'd love to do than
slip into my camisole, put
my feet up, have a little smack.
real good time,
maybe a couple cold ones,
a little chip and dip,
watch some cartoons.
i'd get a big bowl
of fucking coke, i'd just
put my face right in it,
cut it with a little ritalin.
heaven on fucking earth, right?
sure.
for tickets to that show.
<i>whwhatwhat is this,
training day?</i>
all fucking week,
i'd camp out for that.
but you, you piece of shit,
you've been rolling
deep for a long time,
and now it's time
you open up that goddamn mouth
and tell us what
we want to know.
you got good point.
i tell you what.
i open my mouth.
you get the fuck
out my house now!
how's that
for open mouth?
fuck out!
get fuck out!
yeah. i'll get
the fuck out.
all right.
you should really stop smoking,
'cause, uh...
it's an awfully bad habit.
you're leaving half your
lipstick in the ashtray.
i had a, uh,
great aunt that lost
most of her teeth
to, uh, smoking.
good to know.
but, uh, mostly smoking.
you know what?
we're gonna get
out of your hair.
so we're just gonna...
what? that is not front door.

to take a shit?!

what the fuck's wrong with you?!
wow, you are just
all stick and no sugar.

the cigarette or not?
uh, uh, yeah, yeah,
ofofof course i did.

i snagged these matches, too.
i think our guy likes
to go to club ekko.
okay, hold on.
come on.
yes, yes, really.
let's find out, shall we?
all right, hang on.
that couch was disgusting;
i need to wash my hands.

that's what i said.
oh.
wow, your windows are all...
all boarded up.
yeah, i've got the glass,
i just don't have the, you know,
the window blankets.
the curtains?
you mean, you mean the curtains?
whatever. okay?
that's just my family.
that's...
oh.
yeah, it's sweet.
you want something to eat?
i didn't finish my submarine
sandwich from the other day.
oh, god, no, thank you.
thank you.
well, i'm sorry i don't have
poached eggs in rubies for you.
no, i... i don't,
i don't mean to be rude,
but one could catch aa mrsa
infection in here, that's all.
yeah, what part of that
wasn't rude?
just for your,
for your own wellbeing.
i mean, for example, that door.
that door has absolutely
no way of locking.
someone could barge in
at any moment.
it's not safe.
no one's coming in here,
'cause they know i keep this
fully stocked.
oh, my god.
yeah, i know.
a marlin 1894 cb?
yeah.
is that a fnps 90?
yeah. nice one.
you have all this
in your house?
yeah. you didn't even
mention my baby.
look at this.
oh, oh. wow, wow.
my little pride and joy.
okay.
this little beauty could
vaporize an aboveground pool,
if you didn't want the
pool anymore, you know?
no kidding.
yeah, how do you, how do you
refuse that sales pitch, huh?
you don't,
unless you're an asshole.
wow.
haven't seen one of these
since, what, world war ii?
no, god, that's...
occasionally ticks.
put it back slowly.
okay, okay.
i'm sorry.
like, half that speed.
that's... god, okay.
half that speed.
stop sha...
put your pinky down.
i got it on ebay.
it was supposed to be
bigger and different.
it doesn't matter.
i'm gonna "bad feedback"
his ass though.
all right, ladies.
here's the dna results
from the book of matches
and the cigarette butt
you got from tatiana's.
we pulled two sets of prints.
first one's a real nut job.
look at this:
reckless driving,
assault, arson.
oh, god.
who the fuck is this guy?
he's my assistant.
what...
uh, you know
i'm an agent, right?
arson?
god, i... i really feel the need
to finish reading your files,
because this is just, um...
i feel the need for you
to stay out of my business
so i don't punch you in the teeth.
all right, what did you find
out about the cigarette?
okay. hank lesoire.
local businessman.
got tons of ties to
the drug world, black market,
as well as prostitution rings.
coowner of club ekko.
well, it looks like we
found our distributor.
can you, can you
back that up, please?
back up to which one?
hey! i'm not into you.
your breast is invading
my space. it's just...
well, keep your finger
out of my areola.
well, contain your areola.
there. now we're even.
well, he looks like
a real chatty cathy.
did you tap the phone?
i haven't been able to.
guy gets a new prepaid
every other week.  yeah.
by the time i can
get his phone number
and hack in,
he's got a new one.
well, let's get a bug into
the phone this guy does have.
i want to know
what he's saying this week.
yeah, just get
a court order and a bug,
and we'll just do it ourselves.
if you're gonna
boss me around,
you can at least
buy me dinner first.
no.
i'll get that to you asap.
you gotta work on
your game.
that was weak.
what? i thought i
was being charming.
i don't know
what to say to that.
now i just feel bad for you.
okay, so lesoire
coowns club ekko.
let's get over there
and start surveilling it
and figure out how to get
a bug in his phone.
tell me everything
you know about it.
it's just a shitty
club downtown.
i've never been inside of it,
but there's always a line
of awful people
around the corner,
and they've called pd a couple
of times to break up fights...
oh, shit.
what's wrong?
justjust don't look,
don't look... don't look!
just act like we're talking.
hey, robin.
i really enjoyed our
night together, shannon.
you just disappeared on me.
yeah, i know.
i was there.
well, can i take you to dinner
or a movie or something?
god, buddy, do you not
hear how pathetic
everything out of
your mouth sounds?
i mean, there's a girl
out there for you,
but it's not, it's not me.
maybe it's her.
her lady business is
like an old dirty attic.
it's full of broken christmas lights
and, like, doll shoes and shit.
why don't you
clean that out for her.
uh, that's a,
that's a misrepresentation
of my vagina.
oh, wow, what
was that about?
you sleep with a guy
one time,
and he wants to get
married to you.
jesus christ.
yeah, i know
what you mean.
? more than a feeling
? more than a feeling ?
? when i hear that old song...
who is, who is that?
my mom.
ortiz settles into
the batter's box.
verlander with the pitch
and a ground ball
right side through the legs
of cabrera into right field.
pedroia is headed
for second base.
he slides and he is...
how about i tell you
a little something about myself?
oh, god.
i went to undergrad at yale.
i have been with the
bureau for about 12 years.
um, up for a promotion.
see, i... i caught the,
um, i caught the red...
the red falls killer.
yeah, i remember thinking
that guy was innocent.
yeah, he's been in jail
for 11 months.
that would make me
a horrible person,
if any of what you said
was actually factual, so...
well, you can just tell
the judge you fucked up.
i w... i... i... i didn't,
eh, i did not "f" up.
listen, don't get
your panties in a wad.
just...  they're not wadded,
i'm just... my...
i'm intuitive,
i say what i feel.
i'm usually right.
take it or leave it.
okay.
hey, say hi to tommy.
it's tommy.
all right,
there's our guy.
i... i see him as well.
? daft punk is playing
at my house, my house ?
? i'll show you the ropes, kid,
show you the ropes ?
? got a bus and a trailer
at my house, my house ?
there he is, it...
over there.
? i'll show you the ropes,
kid... ?
we got to get past
those bodyguards.
we're not gonna have to,
'cause he's
gonna come to us.
come on.
excuse me!
step aside, please.
all right.
this is, this is
gonna go fast.
when i, when i pull
the alarm,
the crowds are gonna head
towards the two exits.
he's gonna head
towards the nearest one,
which is northeast; i will
bump into him in the crowd.
i will grab the cell,
place the bug within the phone,
tell him he dropped his phone.
it's, it's, uh, something i like
to call a "cop drop. "
yeah. got it.
my god, there are absolutely
no wires attached to this thing.
now, what is that?
what, is that gum or is that...?
no, that's silly putty?
i mean, why is it...?
all right, he's on the move.
okay, we got to get
out there and shake
our asses like the
rest of the foxes.
ah, oh, yes, yes, yes,
dancing to get close to him...
that is a fantastic idea.
okay, here we go.
don't, don't.
what, why are we...?
but, but he's over that way.
just... let's go
find a bathroom.
i told you, i don't have
to use the bathroom.
did i ask you about
your bathroom habits?
you are killing us
out there.
you don't fit in.
take off that
fucking jacket.
well, this is a, this is
a good jacket. this is...
really? 'cause you look like
you're gonna set up a table
and do their fucking taxes.
take off your jacket.
my god, this is
ridiculous... why...?
your shitty jacket? my god.
okay, jacket's off,
okay, jacket's off.
no, no, i can't watch whatever
process is about to happen.
now unbutton
your buttons.
i'm a federal agent.
i don't...  yeah, i know,
and you look like one.
oh, god.  you think you're
gonna bump into him
and he's not going to
think something's up?
fine, fine, how's that?
is that good, is that good?
can we go? can we please go?
i don't know how it's happening.
i think it's getting worse.
i... my fear is that i'm
gonna put you in a bikini
and you'll still look like
a fucking bank teller.
okay, do you have to use
that language, do you?
i'm trying to
make a point.
i'm saying your face
and whatever is underneath
this shitty outfit is maybe
not terrible.  oh, okay.
i'll have you know
i dress appropriately.
i, i, i like to...
i got it, i got it.
it's when this...
your big flapping mouth...
starts running,
and then you put
th  this getup on top of it,
and it's, it's just a...
it's a boner killer,
and i'm gonna help you.
what are you doing, what are
you doing, what are you doing,
what are you doing?
oh, my god, just...
oh, my god.
i, i only brought five
of these to boston.
then, i'll, i'll
cut the other four.
god, that's
terrible fabric.
this was...
this was one
of my favorite ones.
well...
god, just take it off,
take it off!
just give me a second,
i'll take it off!
okay, i, i look like
i've been attacked.
that's not my fault.
what, oh, it's my fault?
let me even out the bottom.
okay, would you just stop
carving up my clothes?!  stop!
i'm making shorts!
everybody likes shorts.
oh, my word.
oh, please, just...
w... hey.
just don't touch that area.
well, don't duck down.
you're gonna suck
my hand up there.
it's... will you pull...?
stop pulling my pants off.
jesus.
what are those?
what?
stop, stop it.
they're my spanx, they hold
everything together.
why, what's gonna f...
come fucking popping out?
nothing! it just keeps
everything
where it's supposed
to be, like in...
shit, like medically?
no, no, not medically,
just to...
uh, just keeps it right
where it's supposed to be.
you got to, you got
to vent that furnace.
okay.  that's a lot of
compression and heat.
it gets plenty of ventilation,
thank you.
my hand's a foot off and it's on fire.
why don't you cut
these shorts shorter
because no one can see
my cervix yet?
go ahead.
no, i'm... stop it, we're finished.
okay, let's
just do you now.
come on, let's just...
i don't need that to...
i put out my sexuality
through motion.
when this starts
going, it's all...
you'll get it.
so i have to look like this
and you get to look like that?
i know, it's not fair.
oh, my god.
we got to tackle
the helmet.
it's got a real...
style memory, huh?
shit, you got to... you
got to flip that shit over.
bend over.
you look like darth vader.
just flip it over.
god almighty.
i gotta just finger tease
the shit out of this.
you're doing what?
you're finger...?
i'm going to
finger tease it.
what is that?
what does that mean?
not what you want it to mean.
? now i lay me down
to sleep... ?
hit it!
? i just can't find
the beat... ?
what are you looking at?
i like how your friend's shorts
make me feel in my shorts.
i am sorry, that was much cruder
than i meant it to be.
i stand corrected
on the shorts.
let's proceed.
oh, god, we're dead.
ah, one o'clock, one o'clock.

'cause of your weapon.

i'm an albino, so i look
like a bad guy, right?
no, no, that's not...
that's not what we were...
yeah, well, i'm dea.
hmm.
and let me tell
you something.
two months we been
sitting on that club,
and then you two come
in here one night
like a couple of
fucking amateurs,
and you almost blow the whole thing!
obviously you have no idea
who you're speaking with.
i'm federal agent
sarah ashburn...
yes, i am sure your
credentials are
quite impressive, as is your
choice of wardrobe there.
nice hot pants.
you might want to try
shshaving above the knee
next time.
are you giving
beauty tips?
do you own a
fucking mirror?
listen to me, all right?
this whole "female
professionals
in the workplace" thing, man,
i'm fine with it, all right?
but here's the problem, all
due respect, with you people...
is that you get
all excited,
you let your emotions
take over,
your hormones kick in,
you're riding the cotton pony.
the next thing you know,
you're complimenting the bad guy
on his fucking couch!
oh, well, all due respect
to you, who's your wife,
a fivepound bag of
flour with a hole in it?
hey, hey, hey,
hey, listen, ma'ams,
we've been cramped inside this
van for two months, all right,
and we're not gonna let you
swoop in from out of nowhere
and take all the credit.
i don't want to see you two
anywhere near this case.
we have got informants
everywhere.
we've got surveillance
everywhere.
we do not need
the two of you
coming in with your estrogen
flying at full speed,
sticking out in the middle
of broad daylight,
fucking things
up for us.
'cause the two of
us are gonna bring
these guys in.
fuck you,
chalk balls.
not even on your
birthday, sweetheart.
that's right, keep walking.
this isn't over.
okay?
and fyi, women were b...
we were born
with hair on our legs.
you don't have to stop.
well, what are you doing?
whoawhoawhoawhoa
whoawhoawhoa!
get...
okay, do you want to tell me
what was wrong back there?
nothing.  i saw your face when
you were looking at the footage.
it looked like you
saw someone you knew.
possibly your brother?
you did not read that
from my fucking face.
you read my file,
didn't you?
god, you're an asshole.
i read your file, but
it is my job to know
everything about a case,
including who i work with.
i don't like that.
we should talk
to him tomorrow.
where is he?
probably at my parents'.
well, then, let's go
to your parents'.
i can't... no, i can't go
to my parents'.  why?
i'm the one that put him in jail.
okay, never mind.
it's not like
i liked doing it.
you know, he got mixed up with
a lot of really bad people
and then he started...
he started using that shit,
and i just had
to get him out of there.
you know, iironically, a lot
of people become addicted
when they're in...
in prison.
i think it's like 80,
require treatment.
i hate you.
yeah, i know;
i'm sorry.
but i... you know,
i actually wasn't finished.
i was going to say...
why can't you just be quiet?
what the "f"?
these are cloth, they're nice.
i could have shot you.
do you not like
someone invading your privacy?
oh, come on.
i, i glanced at your file.
you broke into my home.
i care about who
i'm working with, too,
and it's a little
uncomfortable
that you feel the need
to travel with trophies.
okay, well, it's,
it's not what you think.
they moved me up here, they
rented this apartment, and,
and this is all my stuff.
these four shitty,
sad boxes... this is it?
this is your life?
yes.
oh, god.
i don't think that could be
any sadder if you threw it all
in the trash bag and started
dragging it behind you.
oh, my word, you,
you use coffee filters
for toilet paper at your house.
i'm buying 'em anyway;
they have a dual purpose.
that's not what they're for.
i see it; i see it in here.
looks like you were pretty cool
in high school, huh?
yes, yes, iii was,
but what...?
because you weren't.
you know what that girl's not?
that girl's not cool.
my favorite part is,
you only have two signatures,
both by teachers.
mrs. burke said,
"have a good summer. "
that's a personal touch.
and then my real favorite
is this one.
"it'll get better. "
yes, fine.
okay, now we're even.
okay.
i see you have a cat.
yep.
is he around?
'cause i'd kind of like to,
you know, pet him and stuff.
he ran away, uh,
when i was in new york.
oh, god,
that kind of tears me up.
yeah, it was, um, it was a loss.
that cat got one look
at your shitty life
and said,
"no fucking thanks, man.
i am out of here. "
i'm still
kind of just grieving
a little bit about it.
that fucking tabby is
an asshole, that's what he is.
fuck you.
fuck you...
that's what i say to that cat.
goddamn it.
oh.
even the... you can't
even keep a cat.
ah, you know, that just
hurts a little bit.
that's just the grief.
it's just the, the pounding
a little bit, just...
oh.
all right, well, don't be
a dick about it, but...
well, thank you for that.
that was...
all right, let's
hit the road, okay?
i gotta change.
what's the matter
with your pantsuit?
it's, it's pajamas.
well, excuse
the shit out of me.
i didn't realize you slept
in a fucking tux.
w...
you could get a girlfriend
and get a job.
you don't swear at me.
this is the place
where you're supposed
to be civilized.
okay, stop yelling at everybody.
be a mother.
is jealous of me, then.
in your life, just...
oh, great, this asshole.
all right, just take it easy.
hey, pop.
hey, pork chop.
ah, well, well, well,
look who it is.
yeah, the rat's back in the house.
what, did you come back
to arrest somebody else?
hey, you know, i saw ma threw
a can of, uh, diet coke
in the garbage the other day.
she didn't even recycle it.
dad here... he's splicing cable
off the neighbors next door.
maybe you should start
fingerprinting him, huh?
that'd be a good call, and
maybe get yourself some stripes?
petey over here,
how many, how many songs
you download illegally
off the internet... 5,000?
ten, 20,000.
mikey stole a laptop
from his work
the other day.
stole? i fucking worked
there for six weeks.
i deserved
to fucking take it.
exactly... no health insurance.
that balances out, but not you.
you'll probably call in the
fucking swat team, won't you?
uh, actually she could,
'cause these are
horrible examples.
here are the nuggies.
what kind of an animal throws
her own brother in jail?
this kind of animal,
right here.
shut up, shut up.
how about keeps him
from killing himself?
i was the only one
that got him off the street.
none of you fucks did.
you should never
arrest your family.
who the fuck are you?
well, tell gina i'm going to
strangle her at the table.
hey, she is
my best friend.
you touch her, you got
to go through me first.
who the fuck are you?
i'll kill you and kill her
with your fucking dead body!
okay, everybody calm down.
shannon's right.
this one has no business
chiming in on a family matter.
"this one"?
what, why are you talking
about my girlfriend like that?
she wears sweatpants
to your mother's dinner,
that's why.
those are
her classy sweatpants.
they don't say
"insert here" on the ass.
her ass is hanging out!
look at her, look at her breasts
at the table!
welcome home.
hey.
what, you here to arrest me?
you selling bibles?
no, she's... ashburn.
let's go, let's go.
we need to talk. go.
sit down.
really?
okay, enough,
enough, all right?
get your hands off me.
uh, that is, uh,
that's one of the,
uh, better jesus sportsthemed
paintings i've seen.
that's very good, nice.
what are you doing
at club ekko?
what are you, my mother?
what, were you following me?
how do you know i was there?
'cause i know everything,
that's why.
are you already working
for those guys again?
no, no, this guy julian...
he sent for me
because he wants me to
start working for him,
but i told him, "no,
i'm getting a straight
job," and it's fine.
we're... everybody's cool now.
wewe... parted amicably.
are you a "knock"?
i'm sorry?
a knock. i d... i'm sorry,
i don't know what that is.
a knock.
am i speaking fucking japanese?
yeah, listen to him.
i'm gonna sound
it out for you.
are you or are you not...
a knock?
a fucking knock.
<i>like johnny depp
in 21 jump street.</i>
ah, i see, i see,
okay, aa narc.
a knock, yes.
what are you...
what was i saying?
i was missing the "r"
when you were saying...
i heard "knock",
but apparently there's a "c. "
he said, he said "knock. "
i said fucking "knock," right?
why are you wearing
a longsleeved flannel?
it's hot out.
eh, i'm, i'm a little
fluey, i was...
it's nothing.
to break that thumb?
want me to break that thumb?
mercy, mercy, mercy.
straighten that arm.
uh, it looks worse
than it is.
itit's not a big deal.
this guy julian,
you know,
they don't want me to stop
working, they like me.
you tell me where i can find
julian right now.
no, just stay out of it.
they're fucking maniacs.
they'll chop you up oor
gun you down or worse.
okay, we're...
i don't know anything.
i, i... ouch!
d  d  ddon't.
okay, sal, sal natale.
okay, you know sal natale?
of course i know sal natale.
he was going to steal
this huge shipment
they got coming in,
so they popped him.
he's in the trunk
of his caddy
under the charles
river bridge.
i want you to stay
in this house.
if i catch you
out of this house,
i'm gonna hurt you
worse than them.
what are you, what,
what are you doing here?
what are you doing?
i'm a special agent, and i...
special, like retarded?
well, we don't use that word.
we say "special needs,"
but ii have a very high iq.
are you a boy or a girl?
that's a fair question.
uh, i'm, i'm female.
no kidding.
all woman.
from the getgo?
um...
um...
from birth, yes.
how you get that close
a shave on your face?
i need to go,
but i'll be back to, um...
get back to the airport?
...to... uh, yeah, thank you.
yep, that's sal natale,
all right. hmm.
bullet hole
through the head.
that's unusually
civilized for them.
oh, they cut out
his tongue, too.
ah, there you have it.
they like to send
a message.
did you find the tongue?
shoved it up his anal cavity.
mmm.
yeah.
the tip of the tongue
was sticking out of the rectum,
so it made it appear as if
his buttocks were giving
the police the raspberry.
did they draw googly eyes
or anything on his butt cheeks?
no.
seems like kind of
an opportunity missed.
that would have been funny.
well, ii feel that they were
just trying to be
tongueincheek.
god, don't do that.
uh, where are his belongings?
any clues as to where
the body was killed?
no.  we're still looking
for their base camp.
well, if there's anything on him
that will tell us,
i will find it.
i don't think so.
it's more like a coating.
same traces found
on all the victims' shoes.
all of them had...
epoxy powder coating.
right?
that's right.
and each sample was made up
of the same ingredient,
which probably means
that they...
they were all killed,
same place.
exactly.
i checked it out.
there are three places
that have this kind of powder.
paint factory. yes.
i think we all know that.
take a look at this.
this one right here is centered
in the location...
where all four...
right.
that's what i thought.
this one shut down years ago,
owned by a man by the name
of leif sa...
saggle... sagglemint.
samber...
santino.
santino. santino.
is that a derivative
of sagglemint?
get me the address
to that paint factory asap.
excuse me, ashburn? um, i was
wondering if you would...
okay, this is a little awkward.
uh, it's nothing personal,
but as a rule,
i... i make it a point
not to date my coworkers,
so... thank you.
i was wondering if you would not
talk to me in that tone.
oh. oh! yes, of course.
that's a little different.
no, i... i wouldn't.
why would i?
why would you, really?
just, we should go
to the paint factory.
well, are we clear here?
'cause i don't...
it got real awkward
between you guys.
no, it's... i think
we're all good, right?
uh, we're...
same page.
'cause i don't want any bad...
we're all good, right?
okay, here we go.
let's go to the paint factory.
she doesn't want
to date coworkers,
so spread the word.
shut up.

the west side ?

what your problem is,
but we told you...

i don't know what it is.
are you, uh... you deaf?
shh.
do you not, uh...

i got to do something
with you, man.
look, julian.
i'm sorry.
i'll sell for you guys,
whatever you want me to do.
i'm just trying to make
some extra money.
okay? you can't blame me
for that, right?
relax. i totally get it.
thank you, man.
i'm not going to shoot you.
okay.
it's cool, man. thanks.
wait, wait, hold on,
hold on, hold on!
shit.
all right, if...
if we grab julian,
i can get into his head
and we'll have larkin
by tonight.
two against two.
i like those odds.
i'm going to call
for backup.
it's already here.
oh, hey.
i was looking for you.
um, i forgot to get
your number.
cool. yeah.
uh, it's 1800
givemeyourfuckingguns.
that's... that's, uh...
that's... that's too many numbers.
met these disasters
at the club the other night.
now they're both here.
you think you might
have been bugged?
give me a break.
what the fuck?
think you're hot shit?
guess what?
you guys look
even older in this lighting.
come on.
fuck you!
it's not "fuck me. "
it's "fuck you. "
you know why?
because i'm about
to fuck you up.
pick it up.
do it.
give me a reason
to shoot you in the face.
how long is this going to take?
i don't know.
maybe 12 hours, hopefully less.
i have... i have to find out
what drives him.
we could just go in there
and beat him with a phone book.
no, no, no.
for so many reasons, no, okay?
you just need to be patient,
all right?
it is crucial... crucial
that you remain patient.
it's also crucial
that you stop wearing
that stupid barrette.
don't... just leave it.
i mean, you have one
on your head.
yeah, on top of my head,
like a normal person.
what is the difference?
okay, if you enter that room,
you could break the bond
that we have created, okay?
just please, please,
trust me on this one.
okay, do you understand
how important this is?
yeah, i do.
and you will be patient?
i will.
okay. all right.
hello.
coffee?
i drink a little more coffee
than i probably should.
i... aah!
oh, my...
where's larkin?
you couldn't wait ten seconds?
ten seconds?
you thinking you're
going to make me talk.
yeah, you're talking
right now, dumbass.
you know, you look like one
of the campbell's soup kids
who grew up and
became an alcoholic.
oh, surprisingly catty.
you're a fucking genius.
i asked you to stay outside.
i need to go tough on him.
oh, uh, are you not
already doing that?
no.
i'm doing good cop/bad cop.
you know,
i can hear you.
shut up.
just, please,
don't do anything crazy.
i'm not going to do
anything crazy.
what am i going to do
that's crazy?
i'm a police officer.
huh? i mean, what, am i
going to shoot you in the dick?
you said nothing crazy,
and that is a nono.
nono!
turn around. i need you
to pass a polygraph.
put it away.
no!  don't worry.
she's not going to do it.
she's not going
to do anything.
oh, okay, so you want
to just...
you just want to go
and gamble
with your scrotum
and your testicles?
okay, gamble away.
just go to the corner.
i'll tell you what
we're going to do.
we're going to play
a little game.
okay? i'm going to
take out these bullets.
except for this one,
'cause this is my favorite.
i'm going to keep that in there.
and then you're going to tell me
where larkin is,
and you're going to tell me
where and when
that shipment
is coming in, okay?
right now.
i'm going to kill you
and everyone you know.
aah! god, no.
yeah, that's not what i
fucking asked you, is it?
hey, straight arrow, take the
gun out of this one's hand.
oh, now you want me
to save your scrotum?
when is the shipment coming in?
hey, hey, all right!
ththere's a shipment
on wednesday.
where?
i swear to god, i don't know!
tell her! just tell her where it is!
i don't know! jesus christ,
don't shoot me in the dick!
it's going to be on wednesday!
that's four shots!
don't take any more shots!
don't shoot my dick off!
no! just tell her
where it's coming in!
honest to god, i don't
know where the drop is!
don't shoot me in the dick!
hey! enough! stop it!
you brought julian
and lesoire in?
what are you, out of
your fucking minds?
wasn't too smart.
oh, okay, so you're
not supposed
to arrest someone
when they commit murder
and then turn around
and try and kill you
at the same time?
yeah, you wanted us
to keep them on the street?
you shouldn't even
have been there!
larkin is the big catch here,
not those two.
now we're never going to be able
to bring these fucking guy...
enough. craig, calm the hell
down. we can all hear you.
yeah, dogs can hear you.
yeah, of course
dogs can hear me.
yep.
'cause you...
you look really pale.
it's a genetic condition!
ashburn, come here.
fucking snow cone.
oh, i get it.
that's a good one,
'cause i'm really white.
can i have a moment
with my agent, please?
i'm good.
all right. i'm going to be
right over there.
right there.
thank you.
ashburn, why didn't you
alert anyone
once you found evidence
on julian's whereabouts?
sir, it was an unconfirmed lead.
i wasn't going to waste anyone's
time until i knew it was real.
just give it a rest.
i want you to stand down
while i figure out
how to repair
all this shit with the dea.
sir, no, please.
i... i swear, i've...
i've been doing everything
that you sent me out here to do.
i... we've been doing
such good work.
i know. i know you are.
it's just...
i don't know, it's...
never easy
when you are involved.
fuck that guy.
yeah, yeah.
right? if you're not in trouble,
you're not doing your job.
yeah.
we should go get a drink.
right? what's the point
of being a cop if you can't
get one drink
at the end of the night?
that's what i'm talking about.
oh, ii said just...
i just want one.
yeah, oh, no, no. here.
it is one. it is one.
sometimes he just...
he likes to do this thing,
he pours them
in three little glasses,
but it's one.
all right. here we go.
fair enough.
let's loosen that up.
okeydokey.
there you go.
there you go.
keep a pace.
okay.
don't spit that shit out.
it's not free.
let's go.
keep that in.
hey.
yeah.
i haven't heard
from you.
shit.
no. yeah, you haven't.
well, then, i mean, did i
do something wrong or...?
okay, here we go.
it's not you; it's me.
uh, i'm still working on myself,
so i can't be a part of two
until i'm a better one.
okay, don't.
you don't have to do that.
uh, wait, i still...
my favorite's coming.
oh. you make me want
to be a better woman.
okay, you know what?
i thought we had a good time.
yeah, i... we did have
a lot of fun.
and now we're
going to move on.
let it go.
all right. cool.
hey. hey, no hard feelings,
all right?
oh...
okay.
okay, hit it.
hit it.
bye.
i don't know how
else to say it.
it's pretty clear.
that's why you don't...
you don't feed strays.
yeah.
can we get two more?
shots?
six.
we should just get
one more of these, right?
i don't know, mullins.
it's hard.
i know we're not
supposed to say this,
but being a woman
in this field is hard.
well...
men are just so intimidated
by me, which is, like, why?
and then you put your
personality on top of that,
and it is...
...it is offputting.
you know, i was, uh...
i was actually married for...
for six some years... same guy.
was he a hearing man?
yeah, he didn't, uh...
he didn't understand
how much the job meant to me,
so i thought it'd
probably be best
to just be alone
rather than to, you know,
compromise the work.
i get that.
it's kind of weird that it does
get lonely a little bit.
you know, and it's...
it's hard to make
female friends.
yeah.
i hung out, you know...
really just with my...
my brothers and stuff
growing up, and...
they just kind of all turned out
to be terrible people.
so that's kind of a bummer.
your f... your family loves you.
i mean, in their own
unique... unique way,
but they... you know,
theythey love you,
and that's a wonderful...
very unique.
that sounds like
it's coming from...
somebody
that's an only child.
no, i...
i was actually raised with
a lot of children, so i had...
with the children?
what, in a circus?
uh, no, just in...
in the houses.
oh, my god.
you're a foster kid.
yes, i was.
oh, my god.
no...  jesus, that
clears up a lot.
foster... foster kid.
that makes sense.
that's a tough go of it.
no, it was totally fine.
there was a lot
of benefits
toto being a foster kid.
yeah?
on christmases, there was
thisthis local drug store
it would sponsor...
sponsor us
and give us little baggies of,
you know, toiletries, and stuff.
on thanksgiving...
we would... we would hit
these different
puttputt golf courses.
it was, you know,
you'd meet all kinds of
other kids.
yeah, no. no, no, no.
that is the saddest series
of images i've ever heard.
no, i don't think it
affected me...
i mean, in the long run,
at all; at all.
you're probably fine.
it was, you know,
like, a little bit,
but not anything that's...
maybe it has?
may...? oh, god.
oh, god, my life.
ugh. oh, god.
all right. yep.
all right. let it out.
that's it.
good for you to start
working through it.
i don't feel well.
oh, jesus.
i... wow.  well, you're
not making me feel great.
all right.
blow it out.
really let it go.
you've got more than that.
you've got more than...
oh!
good job. hey.
oh, god, i don't feel well.
good job.
do you want some jã£ger?
oh, god.
oh, god, i feel sick.
can we have two jã£gers?
let's hear it!
? dig
this is for you.
? the chills that you spill
up my back ?
? keep me filled with satisfaction when
we're done ?  oh, yeah, pump it.
? satisfaction of what's to come
sex walk.
? i couldn't ask for another
look at it,
look at it, look at it!
look at it.
? your groove, i do deeply dig
? no walls, only the bridge
? my supper dish,
my succotash wish ?
"my name...
? i couldn't ask for another
you'd better lay
your ass down. "
i smell bacon. i smell bacon.
i smell bacon.
? no, i couldn't ask
for another ?
ooh, ooh.
? groove is in the heart
biscuits are done.
? groove is in the heart
big finish. big finish.
yes!
yeah!  let's do it again.
let's do it again.
no!
stop playing this song.
because you played it
she's a foster kid.
she got, like, q  tips and...
tampons and shit
for christmas.
yeah.
yeah. yeah!
look at her!
all right.

oh, crap.
oh, f...
hey. hey.
how long have we been here?
hey.
hey. hey.
oh, crap.
okay, focus.
uh, you know what?
here's this.
this counts as something.
that's it.
i'm all in.
hey, how's it going?
jesus, you've got to get
a mint in that dumpster.
oh, god.
was i smoking cigarettes
last night?
yeah, you kept
taking them out
of people's mouths
and smoking them.
oh, god, that's so nasty.
it was pretty gross.
oh, yeah, don't worry about it.
i'll get it right back.
all right,
let's see what you got.
oh, shit.
that's great.
that's great.
there you go.
i didn't think you were
going to care that much
about your jacket.
you didn't care at all
when you gave away your car.
who did i give it to?
to wayne.
wayne.
he just walked out of here.
you were sitting
on his lap all night.
you had your tongue
down his throat.
what?!
oh, god.
feels like we've been
hibernating.
didn't bother you
last night.
oh, jesus,
ten missed messages.
will you just...
will you get him, please?
hey, wayne! ashburn wants
her underwear back!
i do not!
you cannot take that car.
it's government property.
oh, yeah?
well, i pay taxes,
so fuck the government!
let's not, okay?
wayne, get out of
the car, you asshole.
oh, god.
oh, my god.
oh, shit, wayne.
oh, my god.
god, your first boyfriend.
you two were electric.
how did julian escape?
federal marshals transferring
him got ambushed.
we're not sure whether larkin's
men followed the marshals
or if they got information
from the inside.
yeah, you don't think
it's a little obvious?
oh, fuck you!
i know when i smell
a fucking albino rat.
if you want to be pointing
a finger around here,
why don't you point it
right back at yourself?!
all right, yeah.
you two hadn't
brought julian in,
then larkin would've never even
known that we were onto him.
and then this whole case
wouldn't be
the giant mixedup bucket
of shit that it is right now.
so fuck you
and your albino prejudice!
now larkin knows who you are,
and julian's angry as shit.
if i were you, i would
get out of town.
you'd like that,
wouldn't you?
ashburn, he's right.
this isn't a choice.
no! no way!
you're not my boss,
puss in boots.
and even if you were my boss,
you still couldn't stop me.
i have more invested in this
case than any of you assholes.
and now you fucked it up, didn't you?
yep, thanks.
that's another
fuckedup area of my life.
thanks for bringing it up.
no, this was
just emailed to me.
okay, fine.
i guess i'm out of line, huh?
yeah, i'm gonna step back and
see what you assholes can do.
yeah, go usa. let's go.
we got to get my
family out of there.
they're gonna kill them.
you know, let me
just talk to hale.
the fbi can
arrange everything.
no! are you kidding? we got
a mole in there somewhere.
and i'm assuming it's
the fucking albino,
but we don't know.
could be levy.
it could be somebody
from my own precinct.
it could be your boss,
puss in boots.
we are going in there by
ourselves and doing it now.
are you with me or not?
okay, okay.
this is bullshit.
why should we uproot our lives
'cause you're an asshole?
go.
it's not her fault.
are you sure you want
to bring everyone?
<i>no, but it'd be like
schindler's list. dad! come on!</i>
we cannot
fit that in the car!
i don't want them to take
my treasures.  jesus.
oh, no, no, no, no, no.
i thought you were outside.
say byebye.
'cause i'll get my boobs
done if we go there.
say byebye. say byebye.
say byebye.  no, no, no, no.
i'll call you when
i get there.  ow.
you are so rude.
this is my house.
no, where are you going?
outside.
i'll be right there.
holy shit, i can see through
your shirt.
oh, god, are you serious?
oh, my god.
what are you doing
with the bat?
just let 'em try to come over
here, shan. just let 'em try.
they're not going to throw softballs at
you... they're going to shoot you, moron.
get your bag.  oh, would you
get over yourself, for christ sake.
bring it on, motherfuckers!
not you, mrs. amendola.
hi. can i drive?
no, but if you could
make your way around...
why don't you get
out and i'll drive.
but if you could make your...
mullins!
your mom, your mom.
our lives are in danger.
i may have to change my name.
what are you doing?
from someone named carla, it's me.
when did you become
such a fucking princess?
you make it impossible.
all right, seat
belts, everyone.
come on, buddy.
come on, buddy.
right in here, buddy.
what the fuck is this?!
that's my puppy. i got him four months ago.
i named him kevin garnett.
you're an asshole.
we're going to a motel.
we're not bring... move.
we're not bringing this
fucking horse to a motel.
we got to get gina.
because you put
her fucking life in danger!
nobody gives a
shit about her.
if i'm going, gina's going.
get in there.
just get in.
move your feet!
i'll chop them off.
thank you.
we're going to gina's!
everyone put your seat belt on.
<i>god, i hope a truck hits us
and we all die.</i>
oh, god.
what the fuck
is this girl doing?
could she go any slower?
could she physically
go slower?
go get your girlfriend,
for god's sake.
she's fine, ma!
i forgot my curling iron,
mrs. mullins!
come on, gina!
get in the car!
what the fuck?
i got you the rollie
so you could roll the bag,
so get over here!
you kidding?
you bought me a bag
for christmas so that i could
carry my own luggage?
gina, come on.
let's go.
i'm gonna get you
a dicksucker for christmas,
so i don't have to do it
no more.
go get her!
jesus christ!
you really...
you didn't say that.
oh, that got
your attention.
go on, go get her.
just break up with this girl,
for fuck sakes.
this'll help.
let's go, let's go!
let's go, you assholes. okay?
let's go, mark!
come on!
knock it off!
just knock it off!
i got this, i got this!
hey, assholes!
you animals!
get in the car!
get in the car!
did she just pull out a gun?
you know what happens now?!
you don't get this one!
so, uh, jason, your
family seemsseems nice.
yeah, we, uh, we have
our good days.
but my makeup is in that one!
i'll rip
your fucking pants off!
<i>if we just knew
where that shipment was</i>
coming into, we would have,
we would have larkin and
we would have julian,
they would both be there,
and we could get them.
i'm just happy that jason, you
know, is out of there for now.
yeah.
it's a shame, though.
having your brother
on the inside
would be a, would
be a coup for us.
that's what you want to say?
'cause you're saying that
out loud.
okay, you know what, mullins?
you would say exactly the same
thing if it wasn't your brother.
we're done talking about this.
so, if it was just
some random drug dealer,
you wouldn't send him back in?
if it was
someone like,
i don't know, rojas,
you wouldn't...
we're not talking
about rojas, are we?  okay.
we're talking about jason,
my brother, you fuckwit.
okay, you know what?
we all have
a lot to lose
if we don't catch larkin.
yeah, what do you have to lose?
i have a lot.
some bullshit promotion?
you don't give a shit
about my family
or if jason gets out there
and gets killed.
i feel that you're not
being honest.
because nobody,
nobody forced your brother
to get involved with drugs.
you're an asshole for that.
okay, you know what?
that's not helping either.
see, i'm trying to
create a dialogue.
note that i am starting my
statements with "i feel. "
i feel...
you know what i feel?
i feel that you have
worn that shirt
every single day this week,
and i feel that you turning it
inside out does not
make it a new shirt.
well, i feel like it does.
oh, really? okay, well,
i feel i disagree.
must be nice.
what? what?
for you to just know everything.
to be so much smarter
than everybody else.
i... i don't profess
to know everything,
but i do know quite a bit.
and what i know is accurate
and scientifically proven,
and i just share
that information with you.
if you have a problem with that,
tune me out
like you always do.
help! he's choking!
okay, i've got it, i've got it.
sir.
okay, i got it. i got it.
check his mouth,
check his mouth!
nothing in there!
let's lay him down.
sir, just relax.
everything will be just fine.
let me get his head back.
okay?
he's choking.
i need a, i need a knife
and a straw please!
i need a knife
and a straw please!
why do you need
a knife and a straw?
why?
perform an emergency
tracheotomy.
what?!
vodka! it's a denny's!
uh, for sterilization...
hot water.
do you know what you're doing?
have you done this before?
technically, technically,
no, but i've been,
i've been doing some
research, and i feel
fairly confident i know how.
jesus! he's still choking,
you know. it isn't time to stop.
okay, sir, what i'm gonna do
is i'm gonna find your...
oh, god, don't, please don't
put that in there.  shh.
stop touching me... so, the
cricothyroid membrane...
i think, i think
it's right here.
i'm gonna make a small incision.
let go of my hand, let go of
my hand, let go of my hand.
i'm gonna make
a small incision.
the reason i'm
doing this... oh!
oh, god.
...is because
you're choking.
i'm gonna cut in...
wow, okay,
just a little bigger.
wow, okay, that goes in
deeper than i thought.
i'm gonna insert my fingers in
here because what's happening is...
don't put your
finger in there.
don't put your finger in there.
there's the membrane, okay?
it's a fucking horror show!
don't put your fingers
in there!
sir, what i'm gonna do
is i'm going to insert
the straw in the hole.
and it's gonna allow the
oxygen to get to your brain.
now if you give
it one moment,
you're gonna feel the oxygen
flow into your brain.
there we go.
jesus christ, that's not oxygen!
that's a lot of blood.
oh, my god, ah!
oh, my god, there's
so much blood!
i don't know
what i'm doing!
stop crying! you did this!
is the ambulance coming?!
i'm so sorry!
i'm so sorry!
what are you doing?
so much blood!
you asshole!
you probably could have just
pulled the piece of pancake
out of his throat.
he's alive, isn't he?
you know what? i have a cut
on my arm from earlier.
do you think
i should amputate it?
you know you're not
a real doctor, right?
yeah, neither are you.
okay.
yeah, byebye.
see you later. yeah, thank you.
byebye.
oh, my god.
ashburn.
why don't you have
your own phone?
who am i, the queen of england?
i don't know, does the queen
of england only wear sweatpants?
fuck you.
this is mullins.
hey, shan, i left, all right?
i couldn't sit there anymore.
where the hell are you?
look, i talked to them,
and everything's fine,
all right?
nothing's weird, we're good.
nonono, nonono!
it doesn't work that way, jason.
they know you're my brother.
you arrested me,
and i made it seem
like i hated you.
that's good, right?
itit doesn't work that way.
shut up for a minute.
look, i know where the
shipment's going to, all right?
okay, i don't give a shit
about the shipment!
what shipment?
let me talk...
and work it or they're
gonna know something's weird.
get off me.
please trust me... i... i'm trying
to do the right thing here.
jason, jason. ow.
jesus christ. jason!
shan.
what the fuck is going on?
give it to me.
don't talk to her!

at 11:00.
okay.  it's a big freighter,
tons of guys, all right?
no, i got it, i got...
so you got to be careful,
you hear me?
okay, okay.
the ship is called the, uh,
"s.s. tank" or something
like that, all right?
i promise we'll be there.
all right, ii got to go.
i'll break
your fucking arm!
god!
just take, just take it
easy, just take it easy.
just...
jason? jason?
shit!
you just made
my brother a dead man!
no, no, he's
gonna be fine.
mullins, i swear,
he'll be fine.
we'll... we're gonna
have thethe full power
of the, uh,
the boston fbi
down on that terminal tonight,
i promise you.
he's gonna be fine.

let's see them!
boat's clean.
it'sit's not clean.
we found a joint in
that girl's purse. if...
oh, now,
this is really a mess.
sir, we just, we just have
to hit the streets again.
we hit the streets,
a  and if the shipment came in...
ashburn, enough.
it's over. i'm sending you
back to new york.
sir, sir, nononono,
please, please.
i'mi'm telling you,
i'm so close.
i'm so close, and this was
just a little hiccup.
no, it wasn't a hiccup.
<i>lo siento.</i>
don't...
don't even... oh, god.
uh, um, sorry.
uh, detective mullins...
have you seen her?
oh, hospital.
some kind of family emergency.
oh, god.
he's in an induced coma.
they shot him and left him
out in the street.
i'm so sorry, mullins.
i'm sorry.
yeah, he was trying
to move on.
he had a job interview.
i... i saw the résumé.
it was a terrible résumé.
he... mentioned prison,
and in "special skills,"
he said, "keeping it real,"
but he...
he was trying.
how'show's your family
holding up?
well, they're not talking to me.
blame me more now than ever.
it's not your fault.
yes, it is.
damn it, i should have
handled it by myself.
so that's it?
i'm not your, i'm not
your partner anymore?
no, you're not.
you're another
fucking disappointment.
i just want you to know
that i'm gonna find
the man responsible for this.
hey, shan.
uh, that was wicked rude.
? you can live your life
? in a crowded city
? you can walk along
? a crowded street
? but the city really
? ain't no bigger
? than the friendly people
? friendly people that you meet ?
ugh, god.
? but it don't do
? too much good to be talkin'
? brother, when there ain't no
? ain't nobody listenin'.
hi.
hey.
i'll give these back to you.
thank you so much for your help.
anytime.
hey...
we're gonna miss you
around here.
oh, i don't think so.
i might.
oh...
you did a good
job out there.
just keep your fingers
out of guys' necks.
it's nasty.
bye.
bye.
all right, if anybody
has any questions,
you come to adam or myself.
that's all we got.
all right.
we sent out alerts to airports,
train stations.
dea's gonna take the lead
on this one, all right?
now, although this is
a joint task force, we're also
working with the boston pd.
right. adam and i are gonna be
handpicking all the officers
so we don't wind up with this.
ooh, ooh.
all right,
any questions?
hey.
hey, that's not right.
no, it's not.
no, that officer
that you're making fun of,
the one that you're all
laughing at, has more integrity,
more commitment, more courage
and more guts
than anybody in this room.
yeah.
but less mental stability.
okay, okay, so, um,
justjust to be clear,
what does mental instability
look like?
keeping people safe?
protecting the community?
getting the job done?
is that what it looks like?
well, then great.
if that's what
mental instability looks like,
sign me up for the crazy house.
that officer right there
is a better
law enforcement officer
than anybody in this room.
myself included.
she is better than you,
she is better than you,
and she's definitely
better than you.
what are you doing?!
are you texting?
are you playing
a game? what?
what is it? put it away.
put it away.
god, you guys are just...
what is, what is
the matter with you?
you're such,
you're just such jerks!
you're just such...
you're just a shitjerk!
you're just a shitjerk
dickfucker!
you're a shitjerk
dickfucker assholer!

get on the ground!
you are under arrest! put your
hands where i can see them,
and tell me
where the fuck larkin is!
hey.
i think it'd be much more better
if you put your hands up.
"much more better"?
drop the gun and take
a grammar course, you idiot.
who the fuck are you?
me and her?
we're the fuckin' heat.
all right.
we've got some scumbags
to visit, huh?
yeah, we do.
