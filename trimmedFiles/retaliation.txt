enough for a battle.
not a war.
we're fighting uphill here.
i came here when i was 14
with a life expectancy of 13.
i was bounced around
from home to home, until this
became my home.
guys were lined up
outside that door to fight me.
they whooped my skinny ass so much
i started to enjoy it.
till one winter,
i grew 8 inches and gained 60 pounds.
i punched a guy so hard
he couldn't move his arm to tap out.
then when the joes
came recruiting to the hood,
i'd already beaten down half of it.
i became a joe to serve. in the field.
so if we're fighting uphill,
we take the hill.
<font color="#808080">jaye:</font> hey, i got something
you'll want to see.
during my check of the president,
look what i found.
this is the president on august 9th.
<font color="#808080">president:</font> <i>...an addiction
to offshore energy,</i>
<i>where we 're forced to be
kind of embroiled</i>

these are conversational fillers.

we spit out to give our brain
a chance to catch up
with our mouth. like...
- like.
- yes.
<font color="#808080">roadblock:</font> and our president?
between august 9th and august 19th,
he stopped using
"you know" and "kind of"
and started using "i mean" and "sort of."
but that's not all.
"supper" became "dinner."
"soda" became "pop."
one president, two fingerprints.
but it's a few words, right?
i mean, how much can...
check this out.

july 31st, september 1st.
see his fingers clasped?
left thumb on top
versus right thumb on top.
the same person
never does this differently,
it feels wrong.
what if the president
isn't the president?
look, if the commander-in-chief
is an imposter
and he's the one that ordered the attack,
we have to assume
that there's no one we can trust.
there is one man.
he's the reason we call ourselves joes.

one final piece of the puzzle.
<font color="#808080">firefly:</font> well done. <font color="#d900d9">(chuckles)</font>
history will stand in judgment.
not of me. of you.
<font color="#d900d9">(laughs)</font>
what do we got, jaye?
zartan's entire focus
has been this nuclear summit.
it has to be the key
to whatever he's planning.
all right. well, then that's our target.
yeah.
guys, move.
<font color="#d900d9">(cocking gun)</font>
<font color="#d900d9">(grunting)</font>
i think i'm faster than you, snake eyes.

good to see you, brother.
jaye.
jinx.
<font color="#808080">flint:</font> back up.
he's with us.
i am not with you.
but for this once,
i am not against you.
how many of our men has he killed?
we're supposed to fight with him?
the leaders of the world
will gather tomorrow. it's a trap.
storm is the only one
who knows cobra's plan
inside and out.
he can help us find a way to stop it.
but we have to work together.
<font color="#808080">roadblock:</font> all right.
let's move.
merry christmas.
makes you wonder
about your neighbours.
nice.
open up that couch.
anything?
i brought my own.
nice.
yeah, that'll work.
hey.
that one's mine.
this really is patton's gun, isn't it?
gift from his family.
what an honour.
you bet.
i was actually thinking about
something a little more your size.
try not to scratch her up.
idles a little rough in neutral.
i ain't gonna be in neutral.
hoo-ah.
what about you?
dod says
i can't come out of retirement.
they didn't say anything
about reenlisting.
reporting for duty, sergeant major.
i'd like to bring a couple friends of mine.
<font color="#808080">roadblock:</font> colton's team,
it's our honour.
you guys take the perimeter.
flint, jaye, snake,
you guys take the flank.
jinx and storm, trojan horse.
zartan will be holding the briefcase.
storm will be the closest man to him.
but he can't move
until we're all in position.
everyone keep your eye on the prize.
we secure the football,
we secure the world.
snake, how's all that sound?
that's what i thought.
<font color="#808080">flint:</font> okay, wait. hold on a second.
we still have enemy armour
here, here, and here.
right?
these tanks survive, we don't.
leave the tanks to me.
general?
call me joe.
- anything i missed?
- no.
rock solid. my orders?
the president.
- brenda's with my team.
- roger that.
does brenda get a vote?
<font color="#808080">roadblock:</font> negative.
you need a pen?
i need your help.
<font color="#808080">roadblock:</font> all right.

gentlemen.
welcome to a nuclear-free world.
i want to direct your attention
to live images of your homelands.
now, you're looking
at an advanced weapons system
we call project zeus.
there are seven zeus satellites
orbiting earth.
<i>each satellite contains
<i>filled with a tungsten rod.</i>
zeus satellite 1-a approaching london.
ordnance live and loaded.
awaiting drop authorisation.
now, to direct a rod to its target,
we don't launch it or fire it.
<font color="#808080">cobra commander:</font> we drop it!
gravity does the rest.
observe.
satellite 1-a.
we have remote launch authorisation.
<font color="#808080">man:</font> three, two, one,
drop.
a rod touches down
eight times faster than a bullet.
and with a force significantly greater
than a nuclear warhead.
none of the fallout.
all of the fun.
<font color="#d900d9">(all gasping)</font>
<font color="#d900d9">(exclaims in hindi)</font>
<font color="#808080">french leader:</font> you will have to
answer for this.
to your congress, your courts.
correction,
they will have to answer to me.
what is it you want?
i want it all.
the cobra revolution has begun.
by pressing that button,
zartan initiated an auto-drop sequence.
my zeus satellites
are moving into position
over your six remaining countries.
satellites 2-a through 7-a
en route to targets.
the same button that begins this
can end it.
