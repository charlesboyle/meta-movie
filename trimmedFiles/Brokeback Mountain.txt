shit.
you pair of deuces
lookin' for work...
i suggest you get your
scrawny asses in here pronto.
up on brokeback...
the forest service has got
designated campsites...
on the allotments.
them camps can be 3, 4 miles from
where we pasture the woollies.
bad predator loss if there's
nobody lookin' after 'em at night.
now, what i want
is a camp tender...
to stay in the main camp, where
the forest service says.
but the herder...
he's gonna pitch a pup tent
on the qt with the sheep...
and he's gonna sleep there.
you eat your supper
and breakfast in camp...
but you sleep
with the sheep 100%.
no fire, don't leave no sign.
you roll up that tent
every mornin'...
in case forest service
snoops around.
yeah?
no.
[man chattering on phone)
no!
not on your fuckin' life.
you got your dogs,
your .30-30, you sleep there.
last summer i had goddamn near 25% loss.
i don't want that again.
you.
fridays at noon,
be down at the bridge...
with your grocery list
and mules...
and somebody with supplies
will be there at the pick-up.
tomorrow mornin' we'll
truck you up to the jump-off.
- jack twist.
- ennis.
- your folks just stop at ennis?
- del mar.
well, nice to know you,
ennis del mar.
[man chattering on tv)
my second year up here.
last year, one storm, the
lightnin' killed 42 sheep.
thought i'd asphyxiate
from the smell.
aguirre got all over my ass, like i
was supposed to control the weather.
but beats workin' for my old man.
can't please my old man, no way.
that's why i took
to rodeoin'. you ever rodeo?
you know, i mean,
once in a while.
when i got the entry fee
in my pocket.
yeah.
are you from ranch people?
yeah, i was.
your folks run you off?
no, they run themselves off.
there was...
one curve in the road in
so the bank took the ranch...
and my brother and sister,
they raised me, mostly.
shit, that's hard.
can i? thank you.
don't let them stray.
joe will have your ass
if you do.
only thing,
don't never order soup.
them soup boxes
are hard to pack.
well, i don't eat soup.
you wanna watch it there. that
horse has a low startle point.
doubt there's a filly
that could throw me.
let's git, unless you wanna sit
around tyin' knots all day.
oh, shit.
can't wait till i get
my own spread...
and i won't have to put up with
joe aguirre's crap no more.
i'm savin' for a place myself.
alma and me, we're gonna get married
when i come down off this mountain.
shit, that stay with the
sheep, no fire bullshit.
aguirre got no right makin' us
do somethin' against the rules.
no more beans.
damn. shit!
- i don't know.
- something wrong?
yeah, so what...
why didn't we get the
powdered milk and the spuds?
that's all we got.
well...
here's next week's.
- thought you didn't eat soup.
- yeah, well, i'm sick of beans.
too early in the summer
to be sick of beans.
come on.
come on. come on.
hold on.
shit.
come back here!
there...
all right. fuck it.
okay, you bastard.
where the hell you been?
been up with the sheep all day, i
get down here hungry as hell...
and all i find is beans.
what in the hell happened,
ennis?
i come on a bear
is what happened.
goddamn horse spooked
and the mules took off...
and scattered food everywhere.
beans is about all we got left.
got whiskey or somethin'?
dumb-ass mule.
i can't believe that. god damn.
let me see.
shit.
well, we gotta do somethin'
about this food situation.
maybe i'll shoot
one of the sheep.
yeah, what if
aguirre finds out, huh?
we're supposed to guard
the sheep, not eat 'em.
what's the matter with you?
there are a thousand of 'em.
i'll stick with beans.
well, i won't.
yeah!
gettin' tired
of your dumb-ass missin'.
let's get a move on.
don't want the game and fish
to catch us with no elk.
come on. shit.
yeah, i'm commutin'
four hours a day.
i come in for breakfast,
i go back to the sheep.
evenin', get 'em bedded down.
come in for supper,
go back to the sheep.
spend half the night
checkin' for damn coyotes.
aguirre got no right
to make me do this.
you wanna switch? i wouldn't
mind sleepin' out there.
that ain't the point. the point is,
we both ought to be in this camp.
goddamn pup tent smells
like cat piss or worse.
i wouldn't mind
bein' out there.
well, i'm happy
to switch with you...
but i warn you,
i can't cook worth a damn.
i am pretty good
with a can opener, though.
you can't be no worse
than me, then.
here you go.
you won't get much sleep,
i'll tell you that.
yup. come on.
shot a coyote up there.
it's a big son of a bitch. he had
balls on him the size of apples.
he looked like
he could eat himself a camel.
you want
some of this hot water?
it's all yours.
i don't rodeo much myself.
i mean, what's the point...
of ridin' some piece of stock
for eight seconds?
money's a good point.
true enough.
if you don't get stomped
winnin' it, huh?
yeah.
well, my old man,
he was a bull rider.
thank you.
pretty well-known in his day.
though he kept his secrets
to himself.
never taught me a thing, never
once come to see me ride.
your brother and sister
do right by you?
they did the best they could
after my folks was gone.
considerin' they didn't
leave us nothin'...
but $24 in a coffee can.
i got me a year of high school.
that was before the transmission
went on the pickup.
and then my sis left. she married
a roughneck, moved to casper.
and me and my brother...
we went and got ourselves some
work on a ranch up near worland.
till i was 10.
then he got married.
and no more room for me.
that's how come me end up here.
what?
man, that's more words than you've
spoke in the past two weeks.
hell, that's the most
i've spoke in a year.
but my dad,
he was a fine roper.
didn't rodeo much, though.
he thought rodeo cowboys
was all fuck-ups.
the hell they are.
well...
there you go.
i'm spurrin' his guts out! wavin'
to the girls in the stands!
he's kickin' me to high heaven,
but he don't jackboard me! no!
i think my dad was right.
tent don't look right.
well, it ain't
goin' nowhere. let it be.
that harmonica don't sound
quite right either.
that's 'cause it got kind of
flattened when that mare threw me.
- oh, yeah?
- yeah.
i thought you said
that mare couldn't throw you.
she got lucky.
yeah, well, if i got lucky, that
harmonica would've broke in two.
♪ i know i shall meet you
on that final day ♪
♪ water-walking jesus,
take me away! ♫
- very good.
- oh, yeah.
my mama, she believes
in the pentecost.
oh, yeah?
what exactly is the pentecost?
i mean, my folks,
they was methodist.
the pentecost.
i don't know, i don't know
what the pentecost is.
mom never explained it to me. i
guess it's when the world ends...
and fellas like you and me,
we march off to hell.
speak for yourself.
you may be a sinner, but i
ain't yet had the opportunity.
thank you.
shit!
i'm gonna go up
to the sheep now.
give 'em hell.
no, i'm...
you can hardly stand. it's too
late to go to them sheep.
well, you got an extra blanket?
i'll just roll up out here,
grab 40 winks...
and i'll ride out
at first light.
you'll freeze your ass off
when that fire dies down.
oh, that's good.
you're better off
sleepin' in the tent.
yeah.
all right.
- ennis!
- what?
just quit your yammerin'
and get in here!
come on, come on.
what are you doin'?
see you for supper.
yeah. come on.
come on.
this is a one-shot thing
we got goin' on here.
it's nobody's business
but ours.
you know i ain't queer.
me, neither.
i'm sorry.
it's all right.
it's all right.
lie back. come on.
twist.
your uncle harold's in
the hospital with pneumonia.
docs don't expect
he'll make it.
your ma sent me to tell you,
so here i am.
bad news.
there ain't nothin' i can do
about it up here, i guess.
there's not much you can do
about it down there, neither.
not unless you can
cure pneumonia.
god damn! jesus!
them sheep will drift if i don't
get back up there tonight!
you'll get pitched off your
mount in a storm like this.
you'll wish
you hadn't tried it!
it's too cold! close it up!
what are we
supposed to do now, huh?
get on in there and untangle 'em
chilean sheep out of ours, i guess.
oh, where is it? shit!
god, half the goddamn
paint brands have wore off!
we gotta try. the least we can do
is get the count right for aguirre.
fuck aguirre!
oh, yeah, fuck aguirre.
what if we need to work for him again?
you think of that?
we gotta stick this out, jack.
you'll run them sheep off again
if you don't quiet down.
what are you doing?
aguirre came by again.
says my uncle didn't die
after all.
says bring 'em down.
bring 'em down, why?
it's the middle of august.
says there's a storm comin',
movin' in from the pacific.
worse than this one.
that snow barely stuck an hour.
besides, that son of a bitch, he's
cuttin' us out a whole month's pay.
it ain't right.
well...
i can spare you a loan, bud,
if you're short on cash.
give it to you
when we get to signal.
i don't need your money, huh?
you know, i ain't in
the poorhouse. shit!
all right.
time to get goin', cowboy.
come here!
this ain't no rodeo, cowboy!
oh, shit!
ennis. ennis.
come here. you okay?
- you okay?
- yeah.
some of these never went
up there with you.
count ain't what
i'd hoped for, neither.
you ranch stiffs,
you ain't never no good.
wanna give it some gas?
i can't believe i left
my damn shirt up there.
yeah.
you gonna do this again
next summer?
well, maybe not.
like i said, me and alma is
gettin' married in november.
so...
i'll try to get somethin'
on a ranch, i guess.
and you?
might go up to my daddy's place and
give him a hand through the winter.
i might be back.
if the army don't get me.
well, i guess
i'll see you around, huh?
right.
what the fuck
are you lookin' at?
"and forgive us
our trespasses..."
"as we forgive those
who trespass against us."
"lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil."
"for thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, forever. amen."
under the powers
vested in me...
i now pronounce you
man and wife.
you may kiss the bride.
and if you don't, i will.
- you all right?
- no.
stop!
no, please don't!
my old lady's tryin' to
get me to quit this job.
she says i'm gettin' too old to be
breakin' my back shovelin' asphalt.
i told her strong backs and
weak minds runs in the family.
she didn't think
that was too funny.
i told her it keeps me fit.
- mornin'.
- mornin'.
pulled in last night.
didn't want to wake you up.
oh, no, i was just...
i thought i'd tell you before
the sergeant showed up.
parking this trailer
on the beach is illegal.
yeah!
well,
look what the wind blew in.
hi, mr. aguirre.
i was wonderin' if you was
needin' any help this summer.
you're wastin' your time here.
what, you ain't got nothin'?
nothin' up on brokeback?
i ain't got no work for you.
ennis del mar
ain't been around, has he?
you boys sure found a way to
make the time pass up there.
twist...
you guys wasn't gettin' paid to leave
the dogs baby-sit the sheep...
while you stemmed the rose.

out of my trailer.
[man chattering on tv)

got a runny nose.
ennis, could you wipe
alma jr.'s nose?
if i had three hands, i could.

yeah.
jenny stopped her coughin'.
i think i should take the
girls into town this weekend.
get 'em an ice cream.
somethin'.
can't we move to town?
i'm tired of these
lonesome old ranches.
no one's around
for junior to play with.
besides,
i'm scared for jenny...
scared if she has another one
of 'em bad asthma spells.
no, rent in town is too high.
there's a cheap place in
riverton, over the laundromat.
i bet i could
fix it up real nice.
i bet you could fix this place
up real nice if you wanted to.
ennis.
i know you'd like it, too.
real home, other kids
for the girls to play with.
not so lonely
like you were raised.
you don't want 'em
to be so lonely, do you?
yeah.
come here.
it ain't so lonely now, is it?
- are you sure the girls are asleep?
- yeah.
come here.
ennis.

our very own rodeo clowns!
give us a beer, doug.
i'd like to buy
jimbo here a beer.
best damn rodeo clown
i've ever worked with.
no thanks, cowboy.
if i was to let every rodeo
hand i pulled a bull off of...
buy me liquor, i'd have
been a alcoholic long ago.
pullin' bulls off of you
buckaroos is just my job.
so save your money for
your next entry fee, cowboy.
you ever try calf ropin'?
do i look like i can afford
a fuckin' ropin' horse?
shouldn't we move
a little closer?
no. come on, let's don't.
jenny'll get scared.
look at this crowd!
bound to be a lot of pussy on
the hoof in a crowd like this.
all swelled up
with patriotic feeling...
and ready to be
humped like a frog.
so, where do you figure
the most pussy is at?
las vegas or california?
hell, i don't know...
but if you make it between montana
and wyoming, i'd take wyoming...
hey! you might want to keep it

wife after his kids was born.
- you know what that's like.
- yeah.
ennis, let's move.
let's just move, okay?
now, i don't want
any trouble from you.

mouths, you hear me?

my boss called and, well, he
wants me to go up to the ranch.
mama.
i guess all the heifers
must've decided...
to calve at the same time.
i figured i could
drop the girls off with you.
ennis, well...
i got a million things i gotta
do here before i can leave.
i don't get off
for another three hours.
mama, i need crayons.
not now, alma.
ennis, please, you promised
you'd take them tonight.
alma, i can't afford not to be
there when the heifers calve.
right, it'd be my job
if i lose any of 'em.
what about my job?
okay, all right,
i'll call my sister.
i'll see if she can take 'em.
all right. all right.
you be a good girl
for your mama, all right?
i'll be half the night.
bring home some ground steaks
if you think of it.
come here. oh, alma, please!
oh, boy.
- okay.
- monroe, i'm so sorry.
it's okay. it's okay, alma.
i'll clean this up just as
soon as i call my sister...
to come get the girls.
really, alma, it's okay.
i'll get it.
alma, come with me.
watch your feet.
alma.
it's just like my hand.
honey, got a surprise for you.
hey.
i got two whole boxes
of formula for you.
you did?
- 120 cans.
- 120?
l.d., where did you put 'em?
oh, hell, back seat of the
car, where i left 'em.
rodeo can get 'em.
l.d., i can already see
who little bobby looks like.
good job, little girl.
he's the spittin' image
of his grandpa.
isn't he just the spittin'
image of his grandpa?
yeah.
look at those eyes.
hey.
hey, honey.
hey, ennis, you know
somebody, name of jack?
maybe. why?
'cause you got a postcard.
it come general delivery.
is he somebody
you cowboyed with, or what?
no, jack, he rodeos, mostly.
we was fishin' buddies.
you can color that one, too.
i'll color the beach.
maybe we could
get a baby-sitter.
take your friend
to the knife and fork?
no, jack ain't
the restaurant type.
we'll more likely
just go out and get drunk.
that's if he shows.
okay, we take one more bite, and
then you're finished with dinner.
there, that's a good bite.
all right, you're excused.
please. thank you.
jack fuckin' twist.
son of a bitch.
come here.
alma, this is jack twist.
and, jack,
this is my wife, alma.
- howdy.
- hello.
you got a kid.
yeah, i got two little girls.
alma jr. and jenny.
- i got a boy.
- yeah?
eight months old. smiles a lot.
i married the prettiest little
gal in childress, texas.
- yeah?
- lureen.
so me and jack, we're gonna head out
and get ourselves a drink. yeah?
sure enough.
pleased to meet you, ma'am.
we might not
get back tonight...
when we get to drinkin'
and talkin' and all.
ennis?
would you get me
a pack of smokes?
if you need smokes, alma, they're
in the top pocket of my blue shirt.
there in the bedroom.
four years. damn!
yeah, four years.
didn't think
i'd hear from you again.
i figured you were sore
from that punch.
right next summer,
i drove back up to brokeback.
talked to aguirre
about a job, and...
he told me you hadn't
been back, so i left.
went down to texas
for rodeoin'.
that's how i met lureen.
made $2,000 that year,
bull ridin'. nearly starved.
lureen's old man makes serious
money, farm machine business.
of course, he hates my guts.
and the army didn't get you?
no, too busted up.
and rodeoin' ain't what
it was in my daddy's day.
got out
while i could still walk.
swear to god, i didn't know we was
goin' to get into this again.
yes i did.
i red-lined it all the way.
i couldn't get here
fast enough.
what about you?
me? i don't know.
i don't know.
old brokeback got us good,
don't it?
what are we gonna do now?
i doubt there's nothin'
we can do.
so now i'm stuck
with what i got here.
makin' a livin' is
about all i got time for now.
hey.
well, me and jack is headed up
the mountain for a day or two.
do ourselves a little fishin'.
you know, your friend could come
inside, have a cup of coffee.
well, he's from texas.
texans don't drink coffee?
you sure that foreman won't
fire you for takin' off?
you know, that foreman,
he owes me.
i worked through a blizzard last christmas.
you remember that?
besides, i'll only be
a couple of days.
bring fish, daddy.
a big, big one!
come here. come here.
come here.
see you sunday, latest.
i'm starvin'. want to
get somethin' to eat?
yup.
last one in!
is there anything interestin'
up there in heaven?
well, i was just sending up
a prayer of thanks.
for what?
for you forgettin'
to bring that harmonica.
i'm enjoying
the peace and quiet.
you know it could be like
this, just like this, always.
yeah? how do you figure that?
what if you and me had
a little ranch somewhere...
a little cow-and-calf operation?
it'd be a sweet life.
i mean, hell,
lureen's old man...
you bet he'd give me
a down payment to get lost.
i mean, he more or less
already said it.
no, i...
i told you
it ain't gonna be that way.
you know...
you got your wife
and baby in texas.
you know,
i got my life in riverton.
is that so?
you and alma, that's a life?
now you shut up about alma.
this ain't her fault.
the bottom line is...
we're around each other...
and this thing grabs hold
of us again...
in the wrong place...
in the wrong time...
and we're dead.
i tell you...
there were these two old guys
ranched up together down home.
earl and rich.
and they was a joke in town...
even though they were
pretty tough old birds.
anyway, they found earl dead...
in an irrigation ditch.
they took a tire iron to him,
spurred him up...
and drug him around by
his dick till it pulled off.
- you seen this?
- yeah, i was what? nine years old.
my daddy, he made sure
me and my brother seen it.
hell, for all i know,
he done the job.
two guys living together?
no way.
now, we can get together
once in a while...
way the hell out in the
middle of nowhere, but...
"once in a while."
every four fucking years?
well, if you can't fix it,
jack, you gotta stand it.
for how long?
as long as we can ride it.
there ain't no reins
on this one.
it's nearly suppertime.
where the hell
do you think you're going?
to work!
i thought you had the day off!
well, you thought wrong!
the girls need to be fed.
well, you take care of it!
alma! alma!
supper's on the stove!
no one's eatin'
unless you're servin' it!
i already promised
i'd take the extra shift!
fucking tell 'em
you made a mistake, then!
god damn it, alma! alma!
you girls need
a push or somethin'?
no.
listen to her purr, gentlemen!
you ain't gonna get that
with your caddy!
i told you what she could do,
and now let me show you.
say, didn't that pissant
used to ride the bulls?
he used to try.
honey, have you seen
my blue parka?
last time i seen it,
you was in it...
day we had that big ice storm.
well, could have sworn
i seen it in here.
you know...
you've been going up
to wyoming all these years.
why can't your buddy come
down here to texas and fish?
because the bighorn mountains
ain't in texas.
and i don't think that his pickup
could make it down here, anyway.
new model comin' in this week,
remember?
you're the best
combine salesman we got.
you're the only
combine salesman, in fact.
yeah, i'll be back in a week. that
is, unless i freeze to death...
and i'll freeze
if i don't find that parka.
well, i don't have
your goddamn parka.
you know, you're worse than bobby
when it comes to losin' stuff.
well, speakin' of bobby,
did you call his school...
about gettin' him a tutor?
i thought you were gonna call.
- i complain too much. that teacher don't like me.
- right.
- now it's your turn.
- okay, fine, so i'll call later.
right. fine.
goodbye.
got 14 hours of
driving ahead of me.
see now, it don't seem fair...
you goin' up there
two, three times a year...
with him never
comin' down here.
[man on tv chattering)
ennis, they got an opening
over at the power company.
might be good pay.
well, as clumsy as i am,
i'd probably get electrocuted.
daddy, the church picnic's
next weekend.
will you be back from fishing
by next weekend?
please, daddy? please!
well, all right, as long as
i don't have to sing.
daddy. thank you.

[tv chattering)

it's all yours, buddy!
it's all yours.
come on, come on.
[tv chattering)
come on in, alvin.
i've been trying to call you
for hours.
it's saturday night, you know,
we could still smarten up...
and head on over
to the church social.
that fire and brimstone crowd?
i think it'd be nice.
ennis.
as far behind as we are
on the bills...
it makes me nervous
not to take no precaution.
if you don't want
no more of my kids...
i'll be happy
to leave you alone.
i'd have 'em,
if you'd support 'em.

♪ king of the road! ♫
in you go.
[radio chattering)
what are you doin' here, huh?
i got your message
about the divorce.
come here.
well, this here's jack. jack,
these are my little girls.
- there's alma jr. and jenny.
- hi.
- say hi, girls.
- hi.
i got your card
that the divorce came through.
- yeah.
- so here i am.
i had to ask about 10 different
people in riverton...
where you had moved to.
i guess, i thought that
this means you...
no, jack,
i don't know what to say.
see, i got the girls
this weekend and...
jeez, i...
i'm sure as hell sorry.
you know i am.
see, i only get them once a
month, and i missed last month.
so i just...
because of the roundup.
so...
- well...
- yeah, all right.
jack.
i'll see you next month, then.
[radio chattering)
[tv chattering)
comin' up.
here we go. here we are!
there, rodeo.
the stud duck do the carvin'
around here.
you bet, id. i was just
saving you the trouble.
bobby, if you don't
eat your dinner...
i'm gonna have to
turn off that television.
why, mama?
i'm gonna be eating this food
for the next two weeks.
hey, you heard your mama.
you finish your meal, and
then you can watch the game.
daddy?
daddy.
hell, we don't eat
with our eyes.
you want your boy to grow up...
to be a man,
don't you, daughter?
boys should watch football.
not until he finishes
eating the meal...
that his mama took
three hours to fix.
now you sit down,
you old son of a bitch!
this is my house,
this is my child...
and you are my guest.
now you sit down...
before i knock your
ignorant ass into next week.
daddy, tell about when you
rode broncs in the rodeo.
well,
that's a short story, honey.
it was only about three
seconds i was on that bronc.
the next thing i knew, i was
flying through the air...
only i was no angel
like you and jenny here.
i didn't have no wings.
and that's the story
of my saddle bronc career.
[tv chattering)
there you go.
you ought to get
married again, ennis.
me and the girls worry
about you bein' alone so much.
well, once burned...
you still go fishing
with jack twist?
not often.
you know, i used to wonder how come
you never brought any trouts home.
you always said
you caught plenty...
and you know how
me and the girls like fish.
so, one night,
i got your creel case open...
night before you went
on one of your little trips.
price tag still on it
after five years.
and i tied a note
to the end of the line.
it said, "hello, ennis, bring
some fish home. love, alma."
and then you come back
lookin' all perky...
and said you caught a bunch of
brownies and you ate them up.
do you remember?
i looked in that case
first chance i got...
and there was my note
still tied there.
that line hadn't touched water
in its life.
that don't mean nothing, alma.
don't try and fool me
no more, ennis.
i know what that means.
jack twist.
- alma.
- jack "nasty"!
you didn't go up there
to fish. you and him...
now you listen to me, you
don't know nothing about it.
i'm going to yell for monroe.
you do it and i'll make you
eat the fucking floor.
get out!
- and you, too!
- get out! get out!
get out of my house, ennis del mar!
you hear me? you get out!
daddy?
alma?
bye, daddy!
bye.
hey, asshole,
watch where you're goin'!
jesus. what...
jesus...
you stupid fuck!
god damn!
god. god damn.
oh, fuck!
damn it!
all i'm sayin' is,
what's the point of making it?
if the taxes don't get it, the
inflation will eat it all up.
you should see lureen punchin'
numbers in her adding machine.
hunting for extra zeros, her eyes
gettin' smaller and smaller.
it's like watchin' a rabbit
tryin' to...
squeeze into a snake hole
with a coyote on its tail.
that's some high class
entertainment, if you ask me.
for what it's worth.
you and lureen,
it's normal and all?
sure.
she don't ever suspect?
you ever get the feelin'...
i don't know...
when you're in town...
and someone looks at you...
suspicious, like he knows.
then you go out on the pavement
and everyone's lookin' at you...
like they all know, too?
well, maybe you ought to
get out of there, you know?
find yourself someplace
different, maybe texas.
texas?
sure, and maybe
you can convince alma...
to let you and lureen
adopt the girls.
then we could just
live together, herdin' sheep.
and it'll rain money
from l.d. newsome...
and whiskey will flow in the streams.
jack, that's real smart.
go to hell, ennis del mar.
you wanna live your miserable fucking life?
then go right ahead.
fine.
i was just thinkin' out loud.
yup, you're a real
thinker there. god damn...
jack fucking twist.
got it all figured out,
ain't he?
all right, hon.
just finished my shift.
wanna dance?
- i was on my way to the...
- i'm cassie. cassie cartwright.
ennis. del mar.
no more dancin' for me, i hope.
- you're safe.
- yeah?
- my feet hurt.
- hard work, is it?
yeah, drunks like you
demanding beer after beer...
smokin'. gets tiresome.
what do you do, ennis del mar?
well, earlier today,
i was castrating calves.
what are you doing?
trying to get
a foot rub, dummy.
all right.
that good?
and then i pledged
tri delt at smu.
and i sure never thought...
i'd end up in a poky
little place like childress.
then i met old randall here
at an aggie game...
and he was an animal
husbandry major.
so we've been here for a month
and he got the foreman job...
over at roy taylor's ranch.
like it or not, here i am!
was you tri delt?
i was kappa phi myself.
well, even though we ain't
quite sorority sisters...
we just may have to dance
with ourselves, lureen.
our husbands ain't the least
bit interested in dancin'.
they ain't got a smidgen
of rhythm between them.
it's funny, isn't it?
husbands don't never seem to
wanna dance with their wives.
why do you think that is, jack?
i don't know,
i never give it any thought.
wanna dance?
- yes, thank you.
- do you mind?
no, it's all right. go ahead.
all right.
pardon us.
thank you for asking me
to dance with you.
i really appreciate that.
randall never does.
last time i did,
i think it was our wedding.
it's a good thing you and lureen
happened along when you did...
or else we'd still be stuck
on the side of the road...
in that darn pickup.
i told randall
we ought to take the car.
of course,
he'd never listen to me.
he wouldn't listen to me
if he was goin' deaf tomorrow.
i told him it'd take more than
chewing gum and baling wire...
to fix that pickup.
well, he's never been
very mechanical, though.
come over here and ask...
you ever notice how a woman
will powder her nose...
before she goes to a party?
and then she'll powder it
again once the party's over.
i mean, why powder your nose
just to go home and go to bed?
don't know.
even if i wanted to know...
i couldn't get a word in with
lashawn long enough to ask.
woman talks a blue streak.
lively little gal.
you'll like working
for roy taylor.
- he's solid, roy.
- yeah, roy. he's a good old boy.
he's got a little cabin
down on lake kemp.
got a crappie house,
little boat.
said i could use it
whenever i want.
we ought to go down there
some weekend.
drink a little whiskey,
fish some.
get away, you know?
that was right out of smu.
i could've had my pick of pretty
much any job in north dallas.
so my pick was neiman marcus,
which was a disaster...
because, honey, where clothes is
concerned, i got no resistance.
i was spending more than i made.
more than randall ever will make.
we come out here...
thinkin' that ranchin' was
still big hats and marlboros.
boy, were we behind the times.
hey there, junior. you ready?
what do you think?
your daddy ever gonna see
fit to settle down again?
don't know. maybe he's not
the marrying kind.
you don't think so?
or you don't think
i'm the one for him?
you're good enough.
you don't say much,
but you get your point across.
sorry.
i didn't mean to be rude.
all right.
you're stayin'
on your feet, cowboy.
excuse me, darling.
so i'll pick you and jenny up
next weekend, after church.
fine.
you all right?
yes.
are you sure?
daddy, i was thinking, what
with the new baby and all...
ma and monroe have been
awful strict on me.
more on me than jenny even.
i was thinkin',
maybe i could...
maybe i could come
stay with you.
i'd be an awful good help,
i know i would.
now, you know
i ain't set up for that.
with the roundup comin'...
i won't ever be home.
it's all right, daddy.
i'm not sayin' that i wouldn't...
it's all right, i understand.
well, see you on sunday, then.
bye.
bye, sweetheart.
going to snow tonight for sure.
yup.
all this time and you ain't
found nobody else to marry?
i been puttin' the blocks...
to a good-lookin' little gal
over in riverton.
she's a waitress. wants to go
to nursing school or somethin'.
i don't know.
what about you and lureen?
lureen's good at making hard deals
in the machinery business...
but as far as
our marriage goes...
we could do it over the phone.
i kind of got this thing
going with...
a ranch foreman's wife
over in rutters.
- what?
- i'm bound to get shot...
by lureen or her husband each
time i slip off to see her.
you probably deserve it.
tell you what.
the truth is...
sometimes i miss you so much,
i can hardly stand it.
i guess i'll head up
on to lightning flat.
see the folks for a day or two.
there's somethin' i been
meanin' to tell you, bud.
well, it's likely november before
i can come out here again.
after we ship stock and before
winter feedin' starts again.
november.
what in the hell ever happened
to august?
well...
christ, ennis.
you know, you had a fucking week to
say some little word about this.
why is it we're always
in the friggin' cold?
we ought to go south
where it's warm, you know!
we ought to go to mexico.
mexico?
hell, jack, you know me. about
all the travelin' i ever done...
is around a coffee pot,
looking for the handle.
come on, jack.
lighten up on me.
we can hunt in november.
kill us a nice elk.
i'll try if i can get
don wroe's cabin again.
we had a good time that year,
didn't we?
there's never enough time,
never enough.
you know, friend...
this is a goddamn bitch of
an unsatisfactory situation.
you used to come away easy.
now it's like seein' the pope.
jack, i got to work.
in them earlier days,
i'd just quit the job.
you...
you forget what it's like
bein' broke all the time.
you ever hear of child support?
i'll tell you this,
i can't quit this one...
and i can't get the time off.
it was hard enough
gettin' this time.
the trade-off was august.
well, you got a better idea?
i did, once.
you did, once.
well, have you been to mexico,
jack twist?
'cause i hear what they got
in mexico for boys like you.
hell, yes, i've been to mexico.
is that a fucking problem?
i'm going to tell you this
one time, jack fucking twist.
and i ain't foolin'.
what i don't know, all them
things that i don't know...
could get you killed
if i come to know them.
i ain't jokin'.
yeah, well try this one,
and i'll say it just once.
- go ahead!
- i'll tell you what.
we could have had
a good life together.
fucking real good life.
had us a place of our own!
but you didn't want it, ennis.
so what we got now
is brokeback mountain!
everything's built on that! that's
all we got, boy. fucking all.
so i hope you know that, if you
don't never know the rest!
you count the damn few times...
that we have been together
in nearly 20 years...
and you measure the short
fucking leash you keep me on...
and then you ask me about mexico
and you tell me you'll kill me...
for needin' somethin'
i don't hardly never get!
you have no idea
how bad it gets!
and i'm not you!
i can't make it...
on a couple of high-altitude
fucks once or twice a year!
you are too much for me, ennis.
you son of a whoreson bitch!
i wish i knew how to quit you!
then why don't you?
why don't you just
let me be, huh?
it's because of you, jack,
that i'm like this.
i'm nothin'.
i'm nowhere.
- it's okay.
- get the fuck off me!
it's all right. it's all right.
damn you, ennis.
i just can't stand
this any more, jack.
come on now, you're sleepin'
on your feet like a horse.
my mama used to say that to me
when i was little.
and sing to me.
i got to go.
see you in the morning.
excuse me.
hey.
ennis del mar.
where you been?
here and there.
i left word for you
with steve at the ranch.
and you must've got those
notes i left at your place.
looks like i got the message,
in any case.
carl?
yeah, carl's nice.
he even talks.
good for you.
yeah.
good for me.
i don't get you, ennis del mar.
i'm sorry.
i was probably
no fun anyways, was i?
ennis, girls don't
fall in love with fun.
hello.
hello, this is ennis del mar.
who? who is this?
ennis del mar.
i'm an old buddy of jack's.
jack used to mention you.
you're the fishing buddy or the
hunting buddy, i know that.
would have let you know
what happened...
but i wasn't sure
about your name or address.
jack kept his friends'
addresses in his head.
that's why i'm callin',
to see what happened.
oh, yeah.
jack was pumpin' up a flat
on the truck...
out on a back road,
when the tire blew up.
the rim of the tire slammed
into his face...
broke his nose and jaw and knocked
him unconscious on his back.
by the time somebody come along,
he'd drowned in his own blood.
he was only 39 years old.
hello? hello?
hello.
was he buried down there?
we put a stone up.
he was cremated,
like he wanted.
half his ashes was interred here, the
rest was sent up with his folks.
he use to say he wanted his ashes
scattered on brokeback mountain...
but i wasn't sure
where that was.
i thought brokeback mountain might
be around where he grew up.
knowing jack...
it might be some
pretend place...
where bluebirds sing
and there's a whiskey spring.
no, ma'am...
we was herdin' sheep
on brokeback one summer...
back in '63.
well, he said
it was his favorite place.
i thought he meant to
get drunk. he drank a lot.
is his folks still up
in lightning flat?
they'll be there
till the day they die.
thank you for your time.
i sure am sorry.
we was good friends.
get in touch with his folks.
i suppose they'd appreciate it
if his wishes was carried out.
about the ashes, i mean.
want a cup of coffee, don't you?
piece of cherry cake?
yes, ma'am,
i'll have a cup of coffee...
but i can't eat no cake
just now. thank you.
i feel awful bad about jack.
thank you.
i can't begin to tell you
how bad i feel.
i knew him a long time.
i come by to say that...
if you want me to take his
ashes up there on brokeback...
like his wife said
he wanted to...
then i'll be happy to.
i'll tell you what.
i know where
brokeback mountain is.
thought he was too goddamn special
to be buried in the family plot.
jack used to say...
"ennis del mar,"
he used to say.
"i'm gonna bring him up here
one of these days..."
"and we'll lick this
damn ranch into shape."
he had some
half-baked notion...
the two of you was gonna
move up here...
build a cabin...
help run the place.
then, this spring...
he got another fella
gonna come up here with him...
build the place,
help run the ranch.
some ranch neighbor of his
from down in texas.
gonna split up with his wife
and come back here...
so he says.
but, like most of
jack's ideas...
never come to pass.
i kept his room
like it was when he was a boy.
i think he appreciated that.
you are welcome to go up
to his room, if you want.
yeah, i'd like that. thank you.
tell you what.
we got a family plot.
he's goin' in it.
yes, sir.
you come back and see us again.
thank you, ma'am.
- hey there, junior.
- hey, daddy.
come here.
like the car?
- yeah. is it yours?
- it's kurt's.
- i thought you were seein' troy.
- troy?
daddy, that was two years ago.
troy still playing baseball?
i don't know what he's doing.
i'm seein' kurt now.
- well, what does kurt do?
- works out in the oil fields.
- so he's a roughneck?
- yeah.
i guess you're 10, you can do whatever you want.
isn't that right?
sure.
- daddy, you need more furniture.
- yeah, well...
if you got nothin',
you don't need nothin'.
so, what's the occasion?
me and kurt...
we're getting married.
well...
so how long have you
known this guy for?
about a year.
our wedding will be june 5,
at the methodist church.
jenny will be singing and monroe
is gonna cater the reception.
now this kurt fella...
he loves you?
yeah, daddy.
he loves me.
was hopin' you'd be there.
yeah.
i think i'm supposed to be on a
roundup down near the tetons.
you know what?
i reckon they can find
themselves a new cowboy.
my little girl,
getting married.
to alma and kurt.
jack, i swear...
