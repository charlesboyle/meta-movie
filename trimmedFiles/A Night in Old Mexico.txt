dynamite, i could ride the son of a bitch.
is that what he told you?
no, sir.
just said you used to ride rodeo.
he didn't talk about you very much.
well, i don't spend a whole lot of my
time, wondering about him either.
but he wanted you to come down
here though and work for me.
wanted you to to reach back to your roots,
get to know the old man.   is that it?
find out where you come from?
this more of my idea, than his.
yeah, but he let you.
your daddy, him know where you are?
oh damn! you run out from home,
didn't you?  am i right or am i rilla?
no, i didn't.
i didn't run out from home.

well, you run off from
college, same damn thing, eh?
- no, no, it's not.

are you all going
down south to mexico?
no, we're shut here
buying gasoline, alright.

'cause our car broke down, so we thought
maybe we catch a ride with you all.
no sir.

- wind it up. we gotta go.
why you a damn parrot?
- $ 55.80.
- $ 55.80?
for you damn parrot.
- hey, i'll gladly buy the gas.
- alright.  okay.
perry the old thief!
so where are you guys from?
aw, you know, here and there.
well, right now just thought we head
down to mexico to see the sights.
i see you got some
beer right there too.
yeah, drink it up, no need to ask.
i like that hat.
slick.
thanks.
yeah, they had something.
all the bull-riders are wearing
fancy buckets like at this season.
you riding bulls, huh?
well, man's gotta eat, i reckon.
i don't know that i even
have nerve to get on one.
does take nerve,
i admit it.
you ain't short on nerve,
i'll say that for you.
say buddy, i don't remember saying
that beer was community property.
never mind.
you got plenty.
so what's the meanest
bull you ever rode?
the meanest?
the meanest...  tell us about it.
i'd like to hear it myself.
oh, that would be...
one by name of midnight.
big black bull.  somebody cut
his tail off when he was just a baby.
well, he never forgot it, you know.
maybe embarrassed him
or something, i don't know.
i tell you this.
yeah, he was a mean one...
oh yes sir. you put hair and horn on
a stick of dynamite, you get the idea.
christ sakes.
you rode him now, huh?
yeah, a buckaroo like him, had a rode
and pick in his nose in one hand
and scratches his little
red hiney with the other.
say, old man, pull over.
who you calling old man?
i'm saying, come on man.
pull over cause i gotta take a leak.
good idea.
the son of bitches
were drinking all my beer.
you see, that wasn't part of the deal.
- you're too much, you know that?
- hey, you're the one who's too much.
trying to pass yourself
off for a cowboy.
hell, you ain't no cowboy.  you ain't
never rode no damn bull, have you?
- now, have you by god?  huh?
- i could go off, if i had the chance.
no, i think you have better
luck selling pipe dreams,
than shuffling papers
like your damn daddy.
stop talking about my father, alright?
you maybe think you
ready to ride a bull,
but hell, you ain't
ready ride no damn bull.
and i'll tell you another thing too.
you ought to throw that goddamn
counterfeit hat after winter
cause there ain't a cowboy
alive go out in public
wearing something
like that on his head.
you know, i won't be
criticizing somebody's hat
if all i own in the world is
this gas guzzling junker.
that's low.  that's really low.
trying to hurt a poor old man's feelings
when he's down on his luck, eh.
just don't criticize my hat, and
we'll get along just fine, okay?
- okay.
- okay.
i would say this for your hat though.
it damn sure goes good with them
dull pack of red boots you wear.
give me another one, eh.
how old is the music, ain't it?
okay.  will do.
now watch it like it's yours, hombre.
remember it ain't.
el día de los muertos.
day of the dead.
it is where they go down
to the grave in order
to have supper with
their dead kin folks.
yeah, the same, all the same.
nothing's changed.
- mattheus, nice to see you.
- hey.
nice thing.
good to see you.
hey, look at this.
careful there amigo!
marriage ain't ....
speak english, i can't
understand that gibberish.
give me a dollar,
watch me cut myself.
i'll give you a five,
go cut your damn throat.
man, that was cold.  how could you
tell him to go cut his own throat?
i gave the poor bastard five bucks,
how much did you give him?
you know that, i gave your daddy a
little pony when he was a little boy
he would have circled all
over the place.  yeah he did.
hey, you alright?

somebody spoon feed me oatmeal
than anything else in the world.
and neither one of you know a damn
thing about that, now would you?
now would you, oh help, oh god!
you know you're going
to get yourself killed?

curse him since i got here!
i told you he left...
little pack of wood ran out on me.
no, no... he didn't run out on you.
no.  you drove him out.
red, you fucking drove him out.
what... because, he
didn't like cow or horses?
no, he didn't like cow
and horses, didn't like rain,
didn't like green grass, didn't
like sunshine, blue skies.
he didn't like a goddamn
thing in this world worth liking.
- well, he like you red.

live with you but...
oh god, do you even know?
i mean, you're all he ever talked about.

he is just a pompous and self-
centered old fucking son of a bitch!
are you fucking blind?
don't you hear nothing?
don't you think he knows
he made some mistakes.
he knows he made some mistakes.
he's just trying to hide a broken
heart behind all that shit!
no, he doesn't have a heart!
no, you're the one who have no heart.
you meant to hurt him!
- you know that.
- what?
you in love with him or something?
i don't know.
maybe.
well, i guess even red
will be a step up for you.
who do you think you
are to talk to me like that?
you know something?
i am like that.
i got nothing and nobody,
and nowhere to go.
but when i'm singing, i'm not
hearing all this shit no more.
i am dreaming that i am somebody else,
and i am dreaming i'm somewhere else.
and red is the first person
that made me happy...
that i am just me!
yes, just me for myself.
and i thought you
were different too, gally,
but you're just another fucking gringo
looking down on me like all them others.

years since i last seen him.
but you loved him
so much, didn't you?
i always thought i'd see him again,
you know, somewhere down the road.
yeah.  imagine dying
on a commuter train.

the goddamn wall street journal.
we've had our differences, but i wouldn't
wish that on nobody, truly i wouldn't.

that damn boy was right.
i did run jimmy off.
and now i'd come run gally off too.
hey, panama.
