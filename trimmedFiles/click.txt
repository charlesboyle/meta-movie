...l said to myself, ''let's smash the mold and redefine elegance.''
so l present to you your restaurant.
where is-- where's bar?

-still itchy? -you got it.
and put big drain in floor for wet t-shirt contest.
now, you're kidding me, right?
boob water's gotta go someplace, michael.
let's just take out the atrium and run with that and there's your drain.
-god. -l love it. lt is simply awesome.
yeah. basically you want me to design you an arabian hoochie house?
how dare you compare prince habeeboo's bikini hut...
-...to this hoochie house? -this idea's...
...got nothing to do with hoochies, michael.
lt's like opposite of hoochie.
no disrespect, prince hubbida hubbida.
-hubba bubba. -habeeboo!

he didn't see me finish.
he was hanging out with ping woo
for some reason.
-yeah, what was that about, huh?
-the kid was drowning.

nobody goes drowning in my pool.

-really?
-yeah.
cute.
hello? mr. ammer.
ben, honey, slow down.
lt's not a race.
that's his second one in five minutes.
keeps eating more and more.
he's like a machine.
he can't still be hungry.
he's not. he's just doing whatever michael's doing. lt's driving me crazy.
everything michael's been doing lately is very unhealthy for him.
he's gonna kill himself.
like a signature building
we're talking about.
oh, my god.
scared the crap out of me.
dad, how much longer are you gonna live?
-one minute.
-one minute?
-daddy's gonna die in one minute!

ls that long enough for you and me?
-promise?
-l promise. swear. come here.
you son of a bitch!
hey! there are families here!
show some respect, you pieces of shit!
go home and watch vh1, old man.
don't light another damn one!
benjamin. benjamin. what am l holding?
a quarter. now, grandma does not let me eat ice cream...
-...because of my diabetes.
-true.
but she says nothing, however, about a tasty quarter.
okay.
all right. all right.
very quickly, please, count to three because it tastes terrible.
one, two, three.
are you shitting me?
first he's eating like his father, now you're talking like him?
-ben.
-don't you ever say that again.
-sorry, grandma. -how do you do that, grandpa?
a good magician never reveals his secrets.
your daddy has wanted to know how l've done that trick...
...since he was your age.
lsn't that true, son?
hey, michael. michael, who are you talking to?
jesus. l'm talking to my boss, ma.
take it easy.
oh, yeah? well, tell him to get a life.
you got family here.
you're busy. come on.
my mother says hello.
oh, he's such a big boy, isn't he?
on his big cell phone. big boy.
that's it. get some sleep. thank you mr. ammer. all right. good night.
-are you done? can we relax now?
-sorry.
eat me, grandpa!
you're dead.
-oh, shit! -yeah, you better run!
l kicked your father's ass in high school!
now l'm gonna kick yours!
l hate that man.
okay, good night, you two cowboys.
-reach for the sky, pocahontas.
-no, back to bed.
come on. pocahontas is off duty.
l'm out of here.
you getting sick, sheriff?
l don't got time to be sick, so no.
l need to watch this documentary
on asian architecture.
well, you gotta get some rest sometime, sweetheart.
besides, the woodland creatures
will laugh at you...
...if you collapse trying to
put up the tent this weekend.
yeah. l forgot to tell you.
we gotta postpone the camping trip.
ammer put me on a project.
lt's due tuesday.
lf l don't finish, l'm off it, so....
the kids have been talking about
camping all year.
think l don't know that?
lt's just every choice l make,
everything l do...
...l disappoint somebody.
make sure you don't keep
disappointing the wrong people.
l'm not out drinking or gambling or hitting on chicks.
l'm working my ass off so my family can have a better life...
...than l dreamed of when l was a kid.
the only way for that to happen is
for me to watch this stinking show!
so relax, hon.
are you kidding me?
will you give me a break one time?
damn it! the o'doyles got a stinking universal remote control.
we're gonna have one too.
l'm sick of this.
you want me to open the garage for you?
closed.
closed.
open.
bed bath & beyond it is.
hey, man?
you guys got any universal remote
controls in there?
-for a shower curtain or a bathmat?
-for a television.
l don't think so. maybe for a blanket?
you got a remote for a blanket?
sorry, l don't work here.
l'm waiting for my friends.
you're kidding me.
actually, yes. l don't have any friends. will you be my friend?
wow, man.
bed. bed.
bath. bath.
bed.
so tired of my life.
beyond?
sorry to sneak up on you. l just--
you guys got a universal remote control back here?
something stinks like stale french fries.
all right, that's probably me.
you know, fast food shortens your life.
yeah, that's what l heard.
but the way my life's been going lately, that ain't such a bad thing.
you're looking for a universal remote control?
yeah. just one device to do it all for me...
...make my life a little easier, quicker, not so damn complicated.
l'm not supposed to do this, but you seem like a good guy.
hey. somebody noticed. thank you.
l'm gonna show you a remote we just got in...
...that's probably the most advanced piece of technology...
...we have in this place.
-sounds sweet. -lt is sweet.
the latest, greatest universal remote not even on the market yet.
l guess the o'doyles' remote can bite my advanced-technological ass then.
l don't know the o'doyles...
...but they can bite it hard.
yeah.
come in the back with me.
okay.
this is-- this is very nice of you.
-what's your name, anyways?
-call me morty.
morty, l'm michael newman.
michael newman.
l'm about to rock your world.
okay.
l gotta be honest with you.
this place looks bigger from the outside.
just kidding.
hey, hey.
l think maybe there in the middle?
sneaky.
where's the box? does it come with directions?
not necessary.
just point, click.
eventually, it will program itself.
how much is this thing?
because l ain't exactly thurston howell, you know?
lucky for you it's not in the bar-code system yet.
so l'm gonna have to just give it to you.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
what's the catch here, man?
want me to take my shirt off for you? because l don't play for that team.
hey. man, get out of here.
why are you doing this, then?
because good guys need a break
every once in a while.
take it.
enjoy.
all right.
only one thing you need to know, michael.
this item is nonreturnable.
why would l wanna return something l got for free?
twinkie. you don't need it. you don't need it, man.
you do need a yodel, though.
okay. good job.
let's see what you got, mate.
look at me, turning my own tv on.
l'm a freaking whiz kid.
<i>--residential architecture....</i>
-so l talked to the kids.
-oh, yeah?
they're very understanding about not going camping this weekend.
-great.
-they could have a sleepover instead.
that's a great idea.
thank you, thank you.
thanks for being so cool about this too.
-can l ask you something?
-yes.
after you do all this work and become a big player at your company...
...do you think you're gonna have more time for us...
...or are things just gonna get even more out of control?
wait. when l get to that place
and become a boss...
...a millionaire, a big shot, the first thing l'm gonna do...
...is hire a bunch of idiots just like me to do all my work.
so then you, me and the kids can do whatever the hell we want.
you just gotta give me some time.
don't give me that look.
l'm just saying, give me some support.
all right?
l love you. go to sleep.
-just think about it, michael. -absolutely.
and stop with the yodels.
-you're gonna wake up 400 pounds.
-okay.
hey, hey, hey. keep it down, dude. everybody's sleeping.
you gotta poop again?
why don't you do the humpy-pumpy on the duck, okay?
will you just hold it in for five minutes and keep the freaking volume down?
l guess when you combine...
...mass quantities of cough syrup with yodels...
...you get acid.
go.
hey, you said you gotta go. go already, man.
sniffy longdroppings, today.
holy motherfu--!
yeah, l mean, you're right.
ln the short run...
...plastic surgery is a hassle.
but six months later...
...l'm gonna have a face and a body...
...that's gonna get me to places
where l wanna be.
oh, my mother, typical you know, she says:
''oh, this procedure is too risky.''
lf samantha wanted her cheekbones shaved down, l think l'd freak out too.
l know, but l just think, you know,
they're too slavic.
you should get some work done.
then maybe michael will wanna
hang out with you too.
morning, michael.
you're looking very crappy today.
morning, janine, you're looking very slavic.
you're just jealous because donna and l are going to the gym...
...and all the guys are gonna
be hitting on us.
michael knows
he's my one and only.
forever and ever, babe.
sorry about last night.
and l love you. l'm s--
oh, my god. l want that so bad.
a husband that l can kiss and
love and give juice to.
you've already cheated on three
different husbands with their brothers.
l think you've given enough
juice to everybody.
love juice.
you know way too much about me.
l should never have done that montel williams show.
even montel williams thinks you're crazy...
...and he's seen a lot of shit.
l was desperate for companionship!
all of my husbands....
all of them have emotionally
abandoned me.
they went to work. you had sex with their unemployed brothers.
-you're a horndog.
-michael.
-okay, sweetie. calm it down.
-no, no!
l have had self-esteem issues
since l was a kid.
l had a rabbit named pepper.
and that rabbit abandoned me too!
even the rabbit did! even the rabb--
don't look at me!
-what's wrong with me?
-bunny rabbit, bunny--
<i>here's the pitch to matsui. a deep drive.</i>
<i>oh, my, it's out of here!</i>
<i>a two-run shot into the right-field seats for hideki matsui.</i>
l'm sorry. what was that?
she has so many problems. why do you have to be so mean?
l don't know, l-- hello.
l gotta go.
yeah, good robodog.
and he can bark in over six different languages.
lt's so cool.
yeah, it's much cooler than your stupid, human dog.
hey, dad, see kevin's new robot dog?
yeah, yeah. very nice.
''very nice''? this thing is worth
more than your car.
-not anymore it ain't.
-robodog!
hey, hey, hey.
okay. ls this some sort of reality show? are you the host?
morty? where are the cameras?
got everybody in on it, huh?
sundance did very well also.
<i>all right, america! have your laugh! i'm an idiot!</i>
donna, l'm gonna get you!
<i>fast-forward.</i>
nobody's laughing at you, michael.
you wanted a universal remote control that remote-controls your universe.
yeah, but what controls my dance skills?
oh, morty likes it too.
michael, just hit menu.
on the remote?
no, the menu at the red lobster. yes, on the remote.
where are we?
<i>-go, michael, go!
-one mississippi. two mississippi.</i>
<i>-what have i got here?
-two, three.</i>
cough syrup's kicking in again.
<i>-we have a boy!

<i>-all right, i love you, michael. -your life menu.</i>
my life has a commentary?
lt's chock-full of goodies.
-click it.
-click it.
this is last tuesday.
<i>michael was eagerly awaiting the arrival of his lunch order.</i>
who's that, james earl jones?
james earl does a lot of voice-over work.
<i>but his anticipation quickly turned to dismay...</i>
<i>...as he realized alice had brought him a cheeseburger...</i>
<i>...instead of a hamburger as he requested.</i>
a cheeseburger? l said a hamburger.
she always does this to me.
<i>michael considered demanding that alice scrape the cheese off...</i>
<i>...but decided not to...</i>
<i>...fearing that alice may spit in...</i>
<i>...or otherwise defile the burger in some manner.</i>
<i>a wise decision...</i>
<i>...for that was exactly
what alice was planning to do.</i>
-are you kidding me?
-sneaky.
my god.
what else we got here?
-''making of''?
-just click.
hey, hey, psychedelic.
where are we?
ls this a porno or something?
oh, ted. oh, teddy!
ls that my parents?
they're making you.

-that's the spot.
-smack my heinie!

l can't see.
-what happened?
-what--?
the floor is so mushy and slippery.
feels good on my feet.

l believe we're sometime
after your conception.
okay, very good, mrs. newman.
no! we're in my mother's vagina?
again. and push.
-lt's a girl.
-lt's a girl!
-oh, lt's a girl. thank you so much.
-thank you for that.

it might be a boy.
what do you mean, ''might be''?
what is that?
maybe that's a penis.
maybe that's a pe--?
that's a penis. that's my penis.
can l see that?
can you bring that a little closer?
see?
-that's a tiny schmeckel.
-yeah?
-we have a boy!
-we have a boy!
your mother must have
some superpower eyesight...
...because l didn't see anything.
let's get out of here.
so if you think about it...
...l can reexperience
any part of my life l want to.
lt's amazing.
what happened? oh, god
what did l do?
hello? how do l
get you back here, pal?
gotcha.
l'm not freaked out enough?
lt's simple. think of a time and a place...
...hit rewind, and you're there.
time and a place. time and a place.

that's me in the jets shirt.
go, little me, go!

lnvite your friends if you want to.
so any of you wanna come by my tent for some supper?
<i>or we could eat at my winnebago
and watch three's company.</i>
<i>three's company.</i>
that's humiliating.
mom, why can't we camp in an rv
like every other family?
oh, come on. you call that camping?
how can you get close to nature
in a tin can like that?
plus, it's more fun to have to
keep each other warm at night.
don't you know it.
-no cupcakes yet.
-but l'm starving.
l agree with you, michael.
you know how hungry l am?
l am so hungry,
l could eat this.
oh, this is where the quarter
trick started.
how the heck did he do that?
oh, it's a trick coin you
buy at a magic shop.
l just couldn't let him
know l knew that.
that's sweet.
now, l gotta get back to work,
so hit play.
lt's a very powerful device.
use it with caution.
okay.

l'm counting on you.
this hotel project? lt's a big fish.

you set your own priorities.
l'm asking for 10 minutes,
not for like, a whole day.
you don't have to do that much.
how big a deal is that?
l am so tired of having this argument.
l skipped the whole fight.

-l can't sleep. -you can't?
l feel bad that we keep arguing.
l know. don't be upset, okay?
-l was a jerk.

hang on for a second someone's at my door.
-hello, michael.
-where'd you come from?
you don't wanna know.
-can we take a walk? -sure.
lt's simple. you must have been on autopilot.
autopilot?
that's what happens to you when you fast-forward.
-okay.
-yeah. l'll show you.
here.
see? that's you on autopilot.
the lights are on but nobody's home.
the remote lets your mind skip around...
...but your body actually stays put for the boring stuff.
we should go to lunch tomorrow and pick out your dad's birthday gift.
sounds good.
so she did tell me.
l'm having conversations on autopilot, then.
you're not gonna be the life of the party, but yes.
everyone goes on autopilot now and then.
the big difference is now you've got a nifty remote...
...to help you decide when.

t's sexual-harassment-speech day.
now, anyone can be a victim of
sexual harassment:
blue collar, white collar a woman,
a man.
even the office slut.
not that l'm mentioning any names...
...stacy.
here we go. sexual harassment
can come in many forms.
you see, what is hilarious to some,
could be offensive to others.
let me try to give you a real-life
example because l'm sure l've done it.
like the day l said, ''you want a promotion, break out the lotion.''
l was technically engaged
in sexual harassment.
hilarious sexual harassment
if you ask me.
now, there is also homosexual harassment.
now, this is like when one dude
comes up to another...
-...and says something cheeky.
-this will be good.
proceed.
l don't know about you americans...
...but to me there is no doubt...
...lchiro is the greatest of all time.
yeah, he's incredible.
you gotta admit, you can always count on matsui.
oh, matsui.
well, if you guys love lchiro
and matsui so much, let's order them both.
l'll eat anything.
-excuse us for a moment.
-absolutely, mr. watsuhita.
see you guys in a bit.
lchiro and matsui are baseball players. you just insulted their national heroes.
l'm going to the bathroom to slit my wrists.
l'll be here.
these morons are so boring.
they make me wanna chop my own dick off.
that hotel design? l'd like to rip it up.
egghead watched a bad documentary on asian architecture.
who needs a stupid river in the lobby?
let's build more rooms and maximize profits.
eat as fast as you can.
then we can get out of here...
...and do jell-o shots at america's greatest cultural achievement:
t.g.l. friday's.
t.g.l. friday's!
-all right, michael, save us.
-l'm all over it, baby.
before we order, l was looking at our proposal. you know what?
after getting to know you a little bit l realize this is not what you're about.
ln fact, let's just throw it out, all right? start from scratch.
the river in the lobby idea what an egghead move.
let's just keep the plans simple, forget all the niceties, maximize our revenue.
that's what it's all about anyways the profits.
but do me a favor. just give us your account and your trust.
that way we can get the hell out of this dump, go to t.g.l. friday's...
...do some jell-o shots till this guy pukes up a lung.
fuck, yeah.
that's what l'm talking about.
yes, yes!
the king is home! hello, hello!
how can you goons sleep
when you know l got you presents?
-you did?
-what is it?
what is it? well, if you bring your
tushies downstairs, we'll find out.
l'm coming. l'm coming.
honey, get your sweet little buns downstairs too. come on, come on!
come and get them.
-awesome! no way! -yeah, yeah.
-lt must have cost a million dollars!
-that's chump change now.
you guys deserve the best...
...and that's what you're gonna
get from now on, okay?
what's all this?
look who's here.
you guys wanna ride these bikes?
-yeah! -let's take them outside!
wake the o'doyles let them see what you got.
these are the coolest bikes
in the whole town.
kevin o'doyle's gonna shit himself.
-don't think l forgot my beautiful wife. -oh, my gosh.
lt's not a bike or a cowboy hat but you're gonna like this, l hope.
-oh, michael, it's beautiful.
-l heard you talking to my mother.
-l love it!
-you look good, baby.
l got myself a celebratory cigar too.
why not?
what are we celebrating?
''what are we celebrating?'' we're healthy, we got a great family...
...l'm ammer's newest partner--
oh, my god, you're kidding! honey, congratulations!
l knew it! l knew you'd be psyched!
l love it! l love you!
l single-handedly landed the watsuhita account.
that's incredible.
l knew it was gonna be a great day.
-l heard our song on the radio.
-we have a song?
honey. the song that was playing during our first kiss.
come on. you're kidding me, right?
l know our song. our song. of course l know our song. our song is....
what the hell was that song?
l remember this place.
and-- oh, my god.
wolverine's goofy cousin.
but look at you. wow.
you are out of his league, aren't you?
oh, yeah, the notes.
smooth, buddy.
oh, look at her.
what's gonna happen?
you got an answer to that?
okay. seal the deal, pal.
all she's thinking about is,
''l am not kissing that beard.
absolutely not, that's gonna hurt me.''
wait a minute.
yeah, newman. get it.
yeah.
donna!
donna. oh, my god.
l'm so horny now.
oh, god, l'm not. get me out of here.
''linger'' by the cranberries was
playing during our first juicy kiss.
and, my god, you looked beautiful in that pink sweater you were wearing.
honey, you remember what l was wearing?
of course. l remember what janine was wearing.
she scared the shit out of me then.
l love you.
l love you too, honey.
hi, mr. newman.
right this way, michael.
hey, my new star. congratulations.
sit down, big guy.
all right.
l am a little tired.
the family was up late last night celebrating.
you really knocked one out of the park last night, didn't you?
hey, you were great too.
all you gotta do is draw up the construction plans.
lf watsuhita commits to the bulk of the funds...
...l'm looking at my new partner.
l thought l was already your partner.
whoa, cowboy.
l said, ''land the watsuhita account you'll get promoted.''
-l didn't mean right this second.
-but l already told my wife, sir.
l spent money l don't have.
to do these documents is gonna
take me months.
then you better get started.
wow, l just got a big headache!
-was l hit by a train or something?
-l didn't see anything.
l forgot to tell you. l hung out
with your friend janine this weekend.
l hope she's doing your brother
right now, you big-headed buffoon.
no, no, no. you got more.
yeah.
anyway, the sooner you get back
to work...
...the sooner you'll be partnerized.
-l taste shit. -you do?
stacy! did you put shit in my lunch?
l'm gonna get going now, sir.
stacy!
have you considered the consequences...
...of the thing you're thinking about doing?
yeah. what are you saying, l shouldn't do it?
lt's your life. what you do with the remote is your decision, michael.
l know, so, l mean, we're talking
a couple of months here.
l fast-forward through it
what am l gonna miss?
thirty arguments and a haircut?
remember the leprechaun?
the one from the cereal ad.
''they're magically delicious.''
that guy?
he's always chasing the pot of
gold at the end of the rainbow.
but when he gets there at the
end of the day...
...it's just corn flakes.
-michael. -yes.
-you don't understand the metaphor?
-l won't do it, all right.
-dad? -yeah.
-we have some designs for you.
-lt's not a good time, man.
maybe they'll help you finish quicker.
all right. you want me to look at it?
let me see.
the ceiling's too high the hallway's
too narrow...
...stairway placement makes no sense at all.
-what the hell's this room made of? -pizza.
well, it's stupid. next.
what is yours made of?
-pickles.
-oh, don't be a baby.
michael, have you lost your mind?
he's 7 years old.
lf he wants a playroom made of pizza
then why not?
maybe he's gotta grow up sometime and get the hell off fantasy lsland.
hey, pizza boy. life ain't about being creative.
lt's about kissing ass, playing it safe, making your boss a lot of money...
...in hopes one day he might throw you a stinking bone. all right?
yes, sir.
ammer didn't make you partner, did he?
oh, honey, l'm so sorry.
but we'll get through this, okay? l promise.
jeez! man, that's all we ever do is get through it.
when is it gonna end?
pretty sweet, eh?
two queen beds, full kitchen, steam shower...
...and satellite tv with surround sound.
why are you always trying to hurt me? one day l'm gonna hurt you back.
michael newman, l didn't know you smoked cigars.
and now's the time.
no, kathy, this isn't mine.
l took it out of kevin's hands. yeah, he was smoking like a chimney.
no, l wasn't!
l think l smell marijuana in it.
kevin o'doyle, you get your ass in this house right now!
l hate you.
are you deaf? move it! l don't wanna have to ask you again!
dope is for dopes, buddy!
get your ass in this house!
we don't have any other choice, guys.
-no fair! l don't wanna return my bike! -we have to, honey.
-but daddy gave them to us! -because he loves you.
unfortunately, there was a mix-up at daddy's work.
we need to bring the bikes back for now.
but l already told kevin o'doyle l got a new bike.
well, we can paint my old bike and make it look new.
that's a girl's bike. all the kids will make fun of me.
no!
l wanna keep my bike!
l can't take this anymore.
fast-forward me to my promotion.
so here's to michael newman...
...the greatest partner l could ever dream of.
hear, hear!
thank you. thank you, guys. my family thanks you.
l'm gonna do the best l can and l won't let you down, l promise.
yeah!
-congratulations, mr. newman. -this is great. thank you.
how's it feel, killer?
-feels incredible, sir. -well, you earned it. l'm telling you.
not just because of that watsuhita project either.
for helping me pick up the slack now l'm spending time with my lady.
hey, dinkie.
are you kidding me? you guys have been dating a couple months now?
that's pretty huge for this one.
no, the first few months were easy.
lt was the one-year hump that was the tough part.
her inappropriate weekend with my brother in cabo...
...well, that was a potential speed bump.
but, well, dr. bergman helped us work through it, didn't he, honey?
how's he doing for you and donna?
dr. bergman. what do you mean?
oh, you know what, sweetie? lt's none of our business.
let's let michael bask in his glory. cheers.
bask away, partner.
took that bastard a year to promote me?
what else did l miss?
-shit.
-need something, mr. newman?
-who are you? -kirsten, your assistant.
what happened to alice?
she moved to accounting. couldn't handle your hours.
and she prefers to be called alan now. remember?
no.
no.
no! and who the hell's dr. bergman?
and l feel like michael's making no effort to connect with me at all.
no, no. l want to. l want to. lt's-- l'm on autopilot.
''l'm on autopilot.'' more like auto-zombie.
good one, donna.
-''good one, donna''? -michael, relax.
who is this bigmouth?
why can't you and l just talk?
why? because there is no talking to you. you're never home to talk to.
and when you are, you're just
sitting there staring off into space.
what do you want from me?
this is what happens. he's gonna
answer his phone.
what the heck happened? l didn't
even touch the remote.
great, you gonna start watching tv at dinner?
oh, can we?
samantha. my little angel. look at you.
look how long your hair's getting.
when did you grow up? ben, get over here.
don't worry. l'm not gonna work tonight.
<i>watch dragon tales together.
what do you say?</i>
<i>dragon tales is for babies, dad. l wanna watch csi.</i>
<i>yeah, csi.</i>
lt's the episode when
they find the lady's arm.
<i>what happened? l missed the whole dragon tales era?</i>
whoa, hey, hello.
what are you doing? come here!
give me my twinkie!
get back here, you freaking gremlin!
don't yell at peanut because he found your twinkie stash.
who's peanut? where's sundance?
don't mention sundance. the kids just stopped crying.
about what? why? what happened?
he died?
oh, no, no, no. oh, no.
the stupid idiot and soft fur.
-daddy held it in so long. -he was the best dog!
he's finally letting himself feel it.
one night when the duck's head was off...
...he tried to hump my leg and l didn't let him...
...and l should've and l'm sorry.
-what an idiot.
-lt's okay, it's okay.
what the heck did l do?
l love you. do you still love me?
oh, michael.
lt's been....
l'm really confused.
no, no, no. l'll change, okay? l'll be a better man, l promise.
don't go, don't go. l'll stop working so much, okay?
l'll be with you. just stay with me.
oh, my god, it didn't take the duck long to get over sundance.
lt's a little deviant but it's kind of turning me on.
yeah, well, let's kiss and make up.
no. no!
lt's not my fault.
lt jumped on its own. l didn't even hit the button.
not even close.
yes?
-you scared-- -honey, what's going on down there?
lt's all right! l-- there was a mouse! l killed it!
lt's dead! but it broke the table first!
-how did you get in here? -l had a feeling you wanted to see me.
l'm freaking out. this thing, it's broken.
lt's just-- lt's fast-forwarding on its own now.
lt's not a malfunction, it's a feature.
lt's using its memory to execute your preferences.
lt remembers stuff? what do you mean?
lt's an advanced piece of equipment like tivo.
you could call it mevo.
l fast-forwarded through sex one time l don't wanna skip it forever.
l like sex. lt feels good.
correct me if l'm wrong, but you fast-forwarded through an entire year.
that's a lot of sex.
put it all together, that's like 30 minutes' worth for you.
oh, no, no. so what, everything l fast-forwarded...
-...it's gonna do it on its own now? -pretty much.
no more showering, no more traffic.
no more arguing. no more sickness.
this is bad, this is bad.
you take it back l'm deactivating my service.
l quit, l quit. thanks for everything, all right, but l--
yeah.
you.... this is not....
don't be mean.
nice hat.
no, no, no.
get away from me. just get away. get away. leave me alone.
ls this a stickup? or are you just happy?
yeah? l'm gonna take my clothes off, then--
l wouldn't do that if l were you.
there's only one place left for it to pop up.
oh. no, no, l don't want that. come on, man.
l told you, this item is nonreturnable.
-come on, just take it. -until we meet again.
don't do that. come on, morty. how do l get it to stop fast-forwarding?
morning, sweetie.
you wanna shower first?
yeah. no! l can't shower because then l'll fast-forward.
and if l fast-forward, who knows how long l'll fast-forward for.
how's this? l'm gonna rough it today, like in the old west. okay?
donna, l wanna tell you what's going on right now so bad...
...but it might lead to an argument. we can't argue because off l'll go.
so just know there is a problem.
l tried to get rid of the problem, it almost ended up in my ass.
l'm gonna go to work and try to figure this out.
you're going to work in your bathrobe?
honey. we can't argue, okay? no more arguing.
you're right. l'm wrong. all the time. you want a kiss?
-l'll take a kiss.
-l can't. lf l give you a kiss...
...it might lead to something else, then...three minutes goes by.
you're laying there disappointed l'm smiling.
l wanna be with you every minute of my life, that's why l gotta leave now.
have a great day!
<i>once again, michael left donna in bed confused and unsatisfied.</i>
shut up, james earl jones!
<i>no, you shut up, big mouth!</i>
michael!
<i>mr. ammer is here</i>
your first day as a partner, you come to work in a fricking bathrobe?
l did. l did.
john, l just feel we should stop wasting our energy...
...on corporate brown-nosing and worrying who's got the better suit.
armani, calvin klein, who cares?
let's concentrate on what really matters, the work.
that's the craziest thing l've ever heard.
but goddamn it, you're right.
life-changing. l feel freer.
yeah-- keep the pants on.
sexual harassment, eh?
speaking of life-changing...
...there's something, or actually someone, l'd like to talk to you about.
-janine. -everything okay?
michael, janine and l decided to drop out of the rat race...
...slow down, move to morocco.
-morocco? -morocco.
okay.
eric lamensoff will assume my day-to-day responsibilities...
...and l'd like you to take his job.
but eric lamensoff is the head of the whole international division.
-l've been your partner one day.
-so?
every account you worked on turned into gold.
you know, l wouldn't be surprised...
...if one day you ended up being our ceo.
hey, l would love for that to happen, but--
no! no, no, no! l don't want a promotion!
no!
<i>michael, you have a phone call.</i>
michael newman.
<i>word up, big guy.</i>
<i>ten years ago you told me you wanted to be ceo.</i>
<i>great news. eric lamensoff killed himself.</i>
<i>so you better stop with the junk food, mr. chairman...</i>
<i>...or you'll end up killing yourself too.</i>
<i>opening virtual blinds.</i>
ten years? how much worse can things get?
oh, my god, l'm a fat guy!
look at me.
what is this? this is titties.
l got juicy titties!
what-- what is that?
oh, god, no.
just take me home.
<i>this is 10 10 wins news. february 5th, 20 17.</i>
<i>britney spears had her 23rd baby today.</i>
<i>proud father kevin federline says he's now considering getting a job.</i>

<i>...is now suing himself for molesting himself.</i>
donna!
donna!
can l help you?
-hey, dad. -''hey, dad''?
ben? that's you?
look how big you got. you're enormous.
<i>look who's talking, captain twinkie of the s.s. fat-ass!</i>
really good for my self-esteem.
maybe if you would take me to pilates like you said...
...people wouldn't think l was rosie o'donnell!
come on, l love you!
-bring me back the twinkies! -you're so cruel!
will you please stop yelling? lt is so embarrassing.
-ls that my daughter? -mom, l'm going to derek's!

the same time you did, dad. now can l go?
whoa, whoa, whoa. who the hell's this derek guy?

-why are you so mean to me?
-get them on now!
-and wipe off all that makeup!
-right!

this one's got the duck doing all the work.
donna. donna.
goddamn it.
look how gorgeous you look. l'm so scared.
-knock, knock, gang.
-hey, sweetie.
what's going on?
donna and l were gonna get hot chocolate.
-you want us to bring you one? -you cheating on me?
with johnny g-string over here?
come on. time-out.
l thought we were past that.
no, no, no, we're past this argument. no, you're right, no big deal.
hey, it's just that you don't mess with another man's wife!
michael! stop it! stop it, michael!
lt was your decision to move out!
so stay out!
get off me! you sticking up for him?
go away! go away, l hate you!
-we can't argue! donna, please!
-l hate you! l hate you!
oh, man!
you hate me?
no. no.
ten years, you're not finished yet?
morty! why did you do this to me?
you did this to yourself, michael.
no. no, l didn't wanna
waste all that time.
l didn't wanna lose donna!
the remote goes by your behavior.
every time you had a conflict
between work and home, work won.
-no, not true.
-lie to your wife.
lie to yourself.
but you cannot lie to the remote.
the remote is lie-proof, so you can't change what already happened.
but you're still a young man.
a young, fat man.
you could win donna back.
so that's what l'll do.
go for it, tubs.
l saw what you did to the duck.
very good. nice work.
you'll feel that in a second.
all right, please, please
just read my note.
--hate you! l hate you! l hate you!
michael, are you awake?
michael, honey. are you awake?
donna.
where'd all my fat go?
lt was just a dream?
a terrible terrible dream.
what's that, michael?
you had a bad dream?
did a fuzzy dog push me over?
oh, shaggy the miracle dog?
yeah, if he hadn't knocked you
on your noggin...
...you wouldn't have had the cat
scan that found the cancer before it spread.
l have cancer?
no, you had cancer.
you're the only person
to gain weight during chemo.
that's probably what
caused your heart attack.
heart attack?
l thought they weaned you off the morphine.
okay, mr. junk food...
...since the injury, you haven't been healthy a full day.
when exactly did l hurt my head?
when was it? like, six years ago?
six more years! no! no!
lt skipped all my sickness.
l'm gonna ask them to cut back on painkillers.
donna, don't go.
what's this?
that's not bad for your third liposuction.
one more tummy tuck should take care of it.
oh, it looks like a tongue...
...licking.
look, l should go. bill's waiting for me downstairs.
-so l'll probably-- -bill?
you're still with speedo torpedo?
whatever happened to ''forever and ever, '' honey?
''forever and ever''?
look, michael, l'm trying to have a civilized relationship with you...
...for the kids' sake.
l really wanna be friends but l can't do that if you--
would you stop flapping that thing?
lt's my flap, l'll do whatever
the hell l want with it!
you done?
look, bill's my husband.
please learn to accept that.
l really have to go.
husband? donna?
no. donna. donna. donna!
