dumb, useless whore!

down on the ground!
- down on the ground!
- no!
down! down!
- get off me!
- easy!
nah!
this is a girl, not a boy.
all right, let's get her up.
no!
what is this?
do you know the people
that live here?
what's going on?
we're sorry to disturb
you, mr. fitzpatrick,
but we received a call
from your housekeeper.
- who the hell is that?
- we don't know.
we found this on her, and
she says she knows you.
- she said she knows me?
- that's what she said.
- where was she?
- in the back, trying to break in.
she was trying to break into the house?
that's right.
did you pat her down?
did she say anything?
she has nothing on her.
nothing else. no id.
- inside, guys.
- a police car.
i know. let's just go in the house.
- but who is it?
- i don't know.
show me.
do you know her?
yes.
let her out.
come on.
how old are you now? fourteen?
fifteen?
- sixteen.
- sixteen.
it's a nice place.
you work in real
estate or something?
no. wall street.
hows your mother, agnes?
it's apple,
remember?
you gave the name to me.
he re's what's up.
i need a place to stay
for a little bit.
that's why i'm here.
i ain't asking you to feel
guilty and stuff like that,
so let's not even go there.
i just need a place to
stay for a little bit.
i'll get a job.
i'll get my own place,
and then i'll be gone.
here.
i knew i couldn't count on you.
have a nice life.
nice to finally meet you.
wait. where you going?
you just showed up.
the police said you tried to break in.
i didn't try and break in. they're lying.
all right, look, maybe there's
something we can work out.
i'm going to have a
word with my wife.
were you in jail?
no, dusty, she wasn't in jail.
it's just a misunderstanding.
we figured it out.
what kind of misunderstanding?
alex, it's not a problem.
it's all better now.
uh, agnes, where are you from?
a lot of places.
and it's apple, not agnes.
hmm?
you can call me apple, not agnes.
oh.
i thought you said it was agnes,
but apple is a beautiful name.
apple? that's a funny name.
and alex is a boy's name.
no, it's not. yours is stupid.
- she smells, and she's weird, mom...
- dusty.
- and why does she have to stay with us?
- shh.
tom?
all right, you guys, time for bed.
cece? bath time.
good night.
good night.
oh, honey, can you please wait?
i think maybe now
would be a good time
for us to have a
little talk together.
why don't you stop
calling me honey?
hey, apple.
you're in my house.
now, look, we want to help you,
but we don't know how to.
we're going to have to get in
touch with your social worker
or someone assigned to your case and
let them know that you're here.
when i was eight, i was
taken away from my mother
when she was arrested for drugs.
i was dropped off at
a mental hospital,
where they kept me in a
steel room all by myself
because i didn't fit in
with the other kids.
from there, i was put into
another temporary shelter.
apple...
every few months, i'd be
assigned some new case worker,
- and we'd start all over again.
- apple, look...
by the time i was twelve,
i was in my tenth foster home.
seemed like good people this time,
until the husband would
come into my room at night
and start touching me and
feeling all up on me.
i told my case worker, and
she got the police involved.
he told them that i
was making it all up,
because that's what troubled
kids do, and they believed him.
i was too scared to even
open up my own mouth.
i ran away and went
to find my mother
and tried to stay
with her for a while.
things got real bad,
and i had to go.
in all that time,
that letter was the only
thing i ever got from you,
now, i'm just asking
you for a little time,
because i am done being passed
off as someone's case number.
i want out of the system!
so are you going to help me out
so i can get back on my feet?
or do you and joanna still
have to talk about it?
- you happy with this?
- yeah.

oh!
ow! damn it!
apple!
where you going?
come here! wait!
hey! i'm talking to you!
wait!
where you going?
it was a stupid idea
for me to come here.
okay? it's never going
to work between us!
never! so why don't
you just turn around
and go back to your life.
and leave me and mine's alone!
where you going to go, huh?
look at you.
you don't even have your shoes on.
who cares?
here. here.
come inside.
are you pregnant?
what?
what are you talking about?
- what am i talking about?
- she's just not feeling well.
why don't you let her answer that?
she's not going to answer anything.
i'm going to ask you again.
are you pregnant?
- i knew it.
- you knew what?
i don't know.
see? she doesn't know.
she doesn't know anything.
- oh, i know.
- you don't know.
- i know, and i'm not-ooh!
- calm down, will you?
we are not having this
baby in our house.
- what baby?
- what baby?
where's the dad?
is he in jail?
i don't know.
we only did it once.
i need to talk to you
right now alone, please.
you want her in our life?
i don't know what you're thinking here!
i will take care of it,
and we need to find...
i want her out!
please, no.
no. come on, no.
no.
hi. we're here to check in.
apple bailey.
thank you.
hear that?
that's the heartbeat.
we almost done here?
just a few more images.
here you go. these are for you.
good luck.
yo.
you see the woman i came in with?
where have you been?
you're all wet.
where you going? where were you?
hey! wait! where did
you disappear to?
look, i didn't disappear anywhere!
she left me there!
she left me!
nobody left you anywhere!
stop! stop!
i left you there?
- you're a liar! you're a liar!
- whoa! whoa whoa!
i waited for her.
she's trying to get in
between us. shes...
you see? do you see
what i mean? a liar!
hey! cool it! maybe you should
give us a minute... now!
hey!
hey, hey, hey, look at me.
look at me! look at me!
apple! what are...
hey. hey.
hey, apple, apple?
well, it's about time.
how are you feeling today?
hungry.
shouldn't you be at
work or something?
i took the morning off.
i had a few things to do with
the construction and all,
and i wanted to check in with you.
yeah, well, i'm fine,
so i guess you can go.
you know...
today is an important
day for my firm,
and especially for me.
one of our biggest clients
asked to meet with me
personally to sign a deal.
do you know why?
mutual respect, trust,
and confidence.
this is what i've
earned from my peers.
it's taken me years to build this.
these are the same words that
i want to speak about with you.
mutual respect,
such as i respect you,
you respect me.
that means when i tell you
something, you stop ignoring me.
trust, such as when this
conversation is over,
i'm going to leave here,
and i'm going to trust
that you are not going to get
into a street brawl with my wife.
and confidence.
these are the positive
results of our relationship
that can begin to happen once the
first two things start to happen.
now, joanna and i had a long
talk last night, and...
it's clear that you are not ready
to assume the responsibility
of motherhood.
think about it.
you have no means of support
you have nowhere to live,
and you have no one willing
to help you except me.
apple?
it's time that you
turn the page on this.
put it all behind you so
that you can move forward.
just turn the page,
and before you know it,
you'll have forgotten
that it ever happened.
mmm.
just... just turn the page.
yes.
and forget about it.
that's right.
like you did with me.
thank you, cece.
ahem.
apple?
look, i know that you must hate me,
and i just wanted to say i'm sorry
about the misunderstandings.
hmm?
no one's perfect, right?
how did your talk go
with your father?
did he tell you?
tell me what?
i made an appointment for you
tomorrow morning at a clinic.
wait, what?
you're not going to be able to take
care of this child by yourself.
we're not going to deal with this,
and if you don't cooperate,
we're going to have no choice
but to ask you to leave.
no.
no, look, i don't want to do that.
it's not about what
you want, honey,
unless you want to end up
just like your mother.
you don't have to worry about anything.
i will be with you to hold your hand.
hi, tom.
not yet.
okay.
i'm sorry. no cell phones, please.
okay. okay, i have to hang up.
honey, i think i'm going to
wait in the waiting room.
can you hurry up, please?
the doctor's on his way.

i'm okay.
i'm okay.
i'm okay. i'm not scared.
i'm not scared.
it's okay.
aah!
please, god.
protect me.
yo, shorty.
shorty, we got some business
we need to discuss.
yo, shorty, let me holler at you.
you going to make me come over there?
i said get in the car. come on.
don't you hear me?
i said get in the car.
we got some business to discuss.
come on, get your ass in the car.
that's what i'm talking about.
get out! i'm going to
kill you, you little bitch!
aah! no!
aah!
aah!
rest easy.
you're in the security ward,
newark city hospital.
i'm father frank mccarthy,
chaplain here at the hospital.
do i have your permission to
be in this room with you?
no, no.
i'm not here about that.
your baby's all right.
the doctors had this taken
when they found the
one in your shoe.
can you try talking?
look, i don't need a priest.
god don't care about me.
don't waste your time.
you're mistaken.
god is ever near and
with us always.
last time i asked for his
help, he put me here.
he's a tough c.o.
at times, but maybe...
you're exactly where
you were meant to be.
"lord, make me an
instrument of thy peace;"
"where there's hatred,
let me sow lave;"
"where there's injury, pardon;"
"where there's doubt, faith."
you still here?
this is still here,
i'm still here.
you were sleeping, so i didn't think
you'd mind if i used your john.
i found out that, uh,
the authorities will probably
drop all charges against you,
but they're going to keep you here
until they can get in
touch with your family
or find you a temporary home.
i didn't ask you to
talk to anyone for me.
why do you want to help me?
it's my job.
you're a priest.
if you were a good one at that, you'd be
at your own church right now, not here.
this is my church.
and i'm not just
thinking about you.
what will happen if you
leave here by yourself?
where will you go?
here.
i want you to have this.
being young and pregnant
is like being a pinwheel.
whenever the weather changes,
you have no idea what way
your life is going to go.
you know, the pinwheel is
supposed to bring good fortune.
go ahead.
blow it.
i did some research for you.
it led me to a special
shelter for teens
who want to have their
babies, like your baby.
don't try and tell me this.
do you think i'm stupid?
i've been in shelters and
foster cares my whole life.
i ain't going back to no shelter!
don't make your child suffer
because you're suffering.
god put you here for a reason.
leave! now!
you talk about suffering!
where was god when
i was getting abused
and suffering all these years, huh?
you can't help me!
you think you know me.
you don't know anything!
now get out!
leave!
just press the nurse's
station on the phone
when you want me to
come and get you, okay?
agnes, i was so worried
about you, baby.
what are you doing here?
agnes, i'm marie abeanni,
your social worker.
i will be handling your
discharge when the time comes.
i had a long talk with your mother.
she's very concerned
about your well-being
and assured me that this
was an isolated incident,
that things at home are
okay between you and her.
is this true?
yo, i already told you we good.
why you asking again?
excuse me.
i need to talk with agnes
now and hear it from her.
agnes, look at me.
your mother has custody,
so it is better if we
work this out together.
if you run away again, we may have
to place you back in foster care.
going home is the best
solution for you.
your mother wants to talk with you
now to settle your differences.
do you think you can do this?
yeah, whatever.
good.
i'll be sitting right outside the
room if you have any other questions.
now, you got people asking
all types of questions,
coming around my place
looking around.
you crazy?
huh?
she said you carrying a baby?
and i got to hear about
it from a stranger.
that's nice. that's real nice.
humiliate me like that!
what's wrong with you?
no, come on.
why you think i'm here, huh?
state's going to take care of us.
you, me, and baby, that makes three.
that means when that baby comes out,
they're going to be
paying us more money.
yo.
we got another chance, all right?
we're going to be a real
family now, sweetie, for real.
come on.
look at you.
taking me back.
you know, i wasn't that
much older than you.
you know, seventeen.
don't look at me like that,
like you all high and mighty.
you know, i didn't have no
social worker caring about me.
nobody wanted me to have you!
come on, wait, wait, wait.
you think i always
looked like this, huh?
like i born in the streets?
you don't know what
i wanted out of life.
you don't know who i was,
who i could have been.
you're so stuck up.
you think you're so
much better than me.
like you're so different.
baby, you are me.
oh, you'll see, you know?
when you're fighting for your baby,
and you're so young,
and you ain't got nobody
to take care of it,
you can't even take
care of yourself.
and all you want to do
is protect your baby.
you know, that's all
i wanted to do.
hold my baby.
my little baby girl.
you don't know.
you don't know, but i did.
i did everything
that i could, agnes.
i did.
and i messed up, okay?
that's right, i did. i messed up.
and then when they
took you away from me,
that was the worst day of my life.
i hurt so much right here.
i just...
i just wanted the pain
to go away, baby.
i didn't want to feel nothing.
i didn't want to feel anything.
look at me.
look at me now.
look at me now.
i deserve a second chance.
a second chance.
please, baby?
please just give me
one more chance.
- um...
- please?
i don't know.
baby, i'm your mother.
i'm your mother
i just can't do this anymore.
- just one more chance, baby.
- i can't do this anymore.
oh, please, baby.
- you got to let me go.
- just...
- you ready?
- yeah. we're done here.
agnes!
"but we will build"
"with hewn stones."
"and the sycamores..."
"...as men rejoice when
they divide the spoil."
"for thou hast broken the
yoke of thy burden..."
father?
i...i just...
i just wanted to...
to come here and... and...
to tell you that...
i probably shouldn't
have yelled at you.
i mean, i know... i know why i did.
i just...
i just... i didn't think that...
that you would...
are you apologizing to me?
no. not really.
seems like it to me.
never apologize for
your true feelings.
now that you're here, grab a book.
make yourself useful.
page seventy-two.
we'll talk later.
go on.
and?
"for i know the plans
i have for you,"
"declares the lord,"
"plans for your welfare
and not for evil,"
"to give you..."
"give you a future"
"and hope."
"then you will call upon me,"
"and... and come and pray to me,"
"and i will hear you."
father mccarthy.
hi, i'm afra, one of
the housemothers here.
welcome to our shelter.
i'll let kathy know you're here.
that's kathy right there
with mother teresa.
and that's her in that
one there with, uh...
at the white house
with ronald reagan.
oh, hello, father. good to see you.
please bear with me.
we were having a little incident.
everything okay?
yeah, everything
worked out just fine.
well, thank you for
meeting my friend, apple.
hello, apple.
kathy's the founder.
she started this shelter,
what, twenty years ago...
mm-hmm.
taking young mothers
into her own home.
this is your home?
well, it's... it's
grown quite a bit.
afra will give you a tour.
i'm going to wrap some things up, and
then you and i will meet in the morning
and we'll have a chat
about the rules, okay?
- yeah.
- okay.
see you suddenly, apple.
hey, everybody, this is apple.
she's staying with us.
her name is really apple?
you all will get to
know her better later.
you'll be sharing a
room with tawana.
uh-oh.
and she'll show you to your room.
and i'll be on duty if
you need something.
apple, huh?
goes well with caramel.
carmel, caramel.
nah, i'm just saying.
we just playing.
she can't... she can't take a joke?
i told you, whatever.
another one?
oh, my god.
- it's about time.
- shut your mouth.
for real.
you can put your stuff in here.
i don't have any stuff.
well, don't worry. you will.
would you mind holding
her for a second?
uh...
thanks.
okay, isaiah.
i hear you.
shh.
i hear you.
- what's your name?
- what the...?
- where you from?
- get that out of my face!
what is going on in here?
i like your pjs.
cassandra, you missed
curfew again tonight,
and you didn't tell anybody
where you were going.
i'm writing you up, and it's
not going to be good for you.
who is responsible for letting
her in here after curfew!
was it you, apple?
look, i don't even know
her, okay? she's crazy.
apple?
this is not going to look
good for your first night.
that's a really nice name.
we will deal with this tomorrow.
but, you know, you shouldn't
call people crazy around here.
i actually prefer cassie.
it's five a.m.,
and i want everybody
back in their rooms now.
what happened with
you two last night?
cassie, why were you
late for curfew?
i went for a walk.
i got locked out.
i'm sorry? you got...
i went for a walk.
i got locked out.
it was nothing, really.
good, because i'm going to put you
both in the same room temporarily.
you're going to be roommates.
- with her?
- mm-hmm.
why?
it'll to give you a chance to
work out your differences.
we have a twenty-four-hour
rule in this house.
whenever two girls are disputing,
they need to work
it out right away.
do you have a problem with that?
no.
it's exciting.
good.
cassie, would you
excuse us, please?
i have something to
talk to apple about.
apple, we have a serious problem.
your mother will not give her
consent for you to be here.
- no.
- i'm very sorry.
- no.
- i tried everything i could.
how could you call her?
she will never let me go.
not as long as welfare
keeps sending her money.
why would you do this to me?
because she threatened
to call the police
and charge us with kidnapping.
what do you have
against your mother?
did she ever abuse you?
i don't want to talk about it.
you can tell me what it is.
i can't.
well, then i can't help you.
as much as i like you and
care about you and your baby,
i won't go to jail for you.
because you're a minor,
i need the support of the state
or consent from your family,
- or some legal...
- and i'm supposed to believe that?
stop talking and listen to me.
or some legal reason why
you have to stay here.
you said you was going
to help me out.
you're a liar.
apple, here you become a mother,
and that means you
take responsibility.
don't cast your immaturity on me,
and then ask me to risk everything,
including the future of this
shelter, on your foolishness.
stop dancing with your demons!
look at me.
learn to cooperate.
shine the light on the lock.
- shh shh shh.
- it won't open.
get lotion.
look at all this.
this is like the shopping mall.
shh! shut up!
check this out. hey.
i don't think he's going to be
able to fit in that any time soon.
you calling my son fat?
you're a huge jerk.
- wow.
- shh, guys.
wow, kathy needs to
clean up her office.
there's a lot in here.
- i know.
- gosh.
hurry up. close the door.
look. what's that?
who's that?

"apple bailey."
"jasmine colon."

this says "compulsive, anxiety,

many questions.

- don't call me pink friday.
- ooh! meow, girl.
"drugs, prostitution,
criminal record,"
"personality disorder."
"no family on record."

physical abuse as a child."

must overcome fear."

no fear?
what about you, apple?
um...
it says, "severe physical
abuse, runaway",
"parental drug/alcohol abuse,"
"multiple shelters
and foster care,"
"aggressive behavior,"
"lack of trust."
don't worry. you can
trust us, though.
you can trust us.
yeah, you're not aggressive.
that's what it says.

how many more of these
do we have to do?
kathy says the more
envelopes we send out,
the more donations we can get.
i got it!
i got it!
it's going to be four black
babies and four white babies now.
um... carmel, you can't count.
you forgot yourself.
just sit down, dum-dum. sit down.
and tina and jaz are
hispanic, not white,
so that's another category.
besides, you don't even
know what apple's baby is.
for all you know, it may be
a caramel color like you.
yet another category.
okay, well, i tried.
well, uh, my baby's father's black.
ooh!
i bet he's fine.
see? i told you.
i bet you guys were getting it on.

very good.
can you get the door?
need help?
i would like to call up kathy
defiore, who many of us know,
to talk about her very special
work that she is doing.
thank you, father marks.
thank you.
good morning, everybody.
or should i say good afternoon?
- good afternoon.
- i have been... thank you...
here eight or nine times
at our lady of sorrows,
and i thought to myself,
"what can i say to you all"
"that i haven't said before?"
twenty years ago, i was homeless.
and i'm not sure
i can really explain
what it was like being
without a home,
frightened and alone,
and all the while trying to hold
onto my dignity as a woman.
and then my life began
to turn around.
i found a job
and a home.
and then i had the most
wonderful inspiration.
i opened my home as a shelter
for teenage pregnant girls,
because, you see, i understand
that this may be the
only chance they have.
so please open your hearts;.
take a look at your envelopes, so
that we can give them shelter,
we can give them guidance, we
can give them an education.
so that we can give them a future.
thank you, and god bless.
thank you.
hi. thank you for coming.
good to see you.
thank you so much.
what a beautiful sermon.
now you're not only a whore, but
you're a frickin' beggar too?
let's see how much they
give an ugly beggar!
give me a kiss!
- give me a kiss!
- stop!
cass!
get off me!
hey.
why don't you come inside?
it is freezing out here.
you can come and help
with the decorations.
we're having a party.
a party for what?
destiny went to the
hospital to have leticia.
we're going to surprise her.
she's going to be
back in a few days.
it's going to be okay.
- okay?
- mm-hmm.
aren't you sick of this?
of what?
what? being exploited?
the way we're marched around here.
the way we're told what
to wear, when to smile,
who to be nice to?
it all makes me sick.
i'm tired of it, aren't you?
look, we ain't got
much of a choice.
well, i know i don't want
anyone feeling any pity for me
except for me.
wait, do you want me to
feel bad for you, apple?
because you know that you're not the only
girl around here who never really had a mom.
why can't she just leave me alone?
i suffered my whole life
because of my mother,
and now that she's gone,
i suffer even more.
you hate her for what she's done to
you, but deep down, you love her,
and that hurts you even more.
yeah.
so what about it?
i'm getting my own place.
you should come with me.
think about it.
and what about your baby?
my baby's all right.
ain't nothing happening to my baby.
you sound like them.
look, i'm just saying that maybe...
everything's set up
for after christmas.
we're going to go
make our own money.
no more of this begging stuff.
are you coming with
me or not, apple?
my beautiful, healthy baby.
you're probably going to need
a little more than that.
father mccarthy.
apple.
thought i'd drop by and
see how you're managing.
i'm okay.
i heard about your mother.
i'm very sorry that happened.
she needs help.
but you have to think about
yourself now and your child.
i caused all this.
it's my fault.
there's a saying in the bible...
"all of us, like sheep,
have gone astray."
"each of us has turned
to his own way."
and that's her way, not yours.
look, i'm leaving here.
one of the girls found a place.
she wants me to come with her.
does kathy know about this?
no.
no, she wouldn't understand.
not until there's an
empty bed to fill.
if you leave the
safety of the shelter,
you put yourself and
your child in jeopardy.
i got to go.
i'll pray for you.
don't bother.

what you trying to do?
the baby needs to turn over.
oh.
they can be very stubborn.

or he gets that, huh?

the sex of the baby?
uh, yeah.
you're having a girl.

no, she kicked me.
cassie, i'm not going.
fine. don't go.
cassie, don't go.
if you leave,
i'll never see you again.
i know it.
don't you get it, apple?
i'm no good here.
it's time to go.
good-bye, apple.
go ahead, loves.
what's the matter, honey?
is he hungry?
okay, i need a... hello?
here's dino, everybody.
- hi, girls.
- hi!
here's dino.
dino has generously donated
this very special meal for us.
oh, come on, it's nothing.
it's nothing for you girls.
come on now!
he's letting us eat here for free?
that's nothing. come on.
enjoy it, girls.
just enjoy it.
all right, everyone, let's eat.
- what is that?
- salad... onions.
- this looks delicious.
- i don't want that.
who needs a plate?
passing down.
oh, that's so good.
ladies, i have a special
announcement to make.
in just a few weeks,
it's going to be a unique
anniversary for all of us.
it was twenty years ago
that i first opened my
home to start our shelter,
and it's because of the
courage of all of you
and all the young mothers
that we have survived.
and i would like to say thank you to you.
and the way i'm going to do that is
i'm planning an amazing
trip to the jersey shore...
for all of us to
celebrate together.
can we bring...
can we bring our babies?
of course, you can
bring your babies.
- oh, my god.
- what?
i think my water just broke.
oh, all right.
there you are.
that-a-girl. that's it.
that's it. that's it.
come on. good, good,
good, good, good, good.
yes, there it is!

need you to relax.

there you are. okay, that-a-girl.
- that's it.
- yes!
good, good, good, good,
good, good, good.
that's it. now stop pushing.
look down, look down.
here's your baby.
my baby, my baby.
what's her name?
- her name is hope.

it's hope.
that's my baby.
oh, my baby. my baby.
shh. you did it, sweetheart.
my baby.
my baby. my baby.
we'll take her right there.
apple, your dad is
in the waiting room,
and he needs to be
part of this moment.
can you do this?
he can come see the baby, but
i don't want to talk to him.
okay. okay.
"i'm sorry it worked out this way."
"i never really meant
for this to happen."
"my name is tom."
"i'm your father, but we'll
probably never know each other."
"i just found out you're
going to be a girl."
"june and i barely
know each other."
"we just went out a few times."
"it's not like we planned this."
"you just happened."
"you showed up unexpectedly."
"i'm living at home
with my parents."
"i'm about to start college."
"i can't disappoint them."
"i have no choice."
"june is stubborn."
"i can't talk to her."
"i'll never see her again,"
"so i guess i'll never see you."
"that hurts."
"i would have liked
to be your father,"
"but i'm just not ready."
"i guess i'm hoping that you
may someday understand"
"and forgive me..."
"and that maybe"
"you would be apple of my eye."
"i'm sorry. tom."
