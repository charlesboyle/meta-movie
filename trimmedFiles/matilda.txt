everyone is born,</i>

is born the same.</i>

every human being is unique,</i>
<i>for better or for worse.</i>
[growls]
<i>most parents believe their children are the most

harry: what a waste of time.
zinnia: and painful.
and expensive.
$9.25 for a bar of soap?
well, i had to take a shower, harry.
$5000?
i'm not paying it. what are they
gonna do, repossess the kid?
[tires screech]
harry: there's no way out.
make a u-turn.
all right.
zinnia: harry!
harry: all right.
zinnia: harry!
kid:
the wormwood guy's back!
narrator:
<i>harry and zinnia wormwood</i>
<i>lived in a very nice neighborhood,
in a very nice house.</i>
<i>but they were not really
very nice people.</i>
harry:
get out of the street, you little dodos!
<i>narrator: the wormwoods were so
wrapped up in their own silly lives</i>
<i>that they barely noticed
they had a daughter.</i>
<i>had they paid any attention
to her at all,</i>
<i>they'd have realized
she was a rather extraordinary child.</i>
oh, my gosh, matilda,
now look what you did!
<i>they named her matilda.</i>
zinnia: you're supposed
to eat the spinach. ooh!
ew, ew, ew.
ew, ew, ew!
babies!
you're better off raising tomatoes.
<i>narrator:
by the time she was 2,</i>
<i>matilda had learned what most
people learn in their early 30s:</i>
<i>how to take care of herself.</i>
<i>as time went by,
she developed a sense of style.</i>
<i>every morning, matilda's brother,
michael, went to school.</i>
bye, mom.
get out of here.
<i>her father worked selling used cars
make money.</i>
<i>for unfair prices.
and her mother took off to play bingo.</i>
soup's on the stove.
heat it up if you get hungry.
<i>matilda was left alone.</i>
[door closes]
<i>that was how she liked it.</i>
[rusted root's "send me on my way" playing]

<i>♪ you know what they say

<i>♪ well, pick me up with golden hand ♪</i>
<i>♪ i may see you ♪</i>
<i>narrator: by the time she was 4, matilda
had read every magazine in the house.</i>
<i>one night,
she got up her courage</i>
<i>and asked her father for something
she desperately wanted.</i>
a book?
what do you want a book for?
to read.
to read? why would you wanna read
when you got the television set
sitting right in front of you?
there's nothing you can get from a book that
you can't get from a television faster.
get out of the way!
<i>narrator: matilda already knew that she
was somewhat different from her family.</i>
[harry burps]
<i>she saw that whatever
she needed in this world,</i>
<i>she'd have to get herself.</i>
<i>bye.
ciao.</i>
there's fish fingers
in the microwave.
narrator: <i>the next morning,
after her parents left,</i>
<i>matilda set off
in search of a book.</i>
<i>[♪♪♪]</i>
where are the
children's books, please?
in that room right over there.
would you like me to pick you out
one with lots of pictures in it?
no, thank you.
i'm sure i can manage.
<i>narrator: from then on, every day,
as soon as her mother went to bingo,</i>
<i>matilda walked
the 10 blocks to the library</i>
<i>and devoured
one book after another.</i>
[laughing]
<i>when she finished
all the children's books,</i>
<i>she started wandering around
in search of something else.</i>
<i>mrs. phelps, who had been
watching her with fascination</i>
<i>for the past few weeks,</i>
<i>offered matilda some valuable
library information.</i>
you know, you could have
your very own library card.
and then you could
take books home
and you wouldn't have
to walk here every day.
you could take
as many as you like.
that would be wonderful.
<i>narrator: so matilda's strong,
young mind continued to grow,</i>
<i>nurtured by the voices
of all those authors</i>
<i>who had sent their books
out into the world</i>
<i>like ships onto the sea.</i>
<i>these books gave matilda
a hopeful and comforting message:</i>
<i>you are not alone.</i>
[children chattering]
any packages come today?
mm-mm.
where did
all this come from?
the library.
the library? you've never set foot in a library.
you're only 4 years old.
six and a half.
you're 4.
six and a half.
if you were 6 and a half,
you'd be in school already.
i want to be in school.
i told you
i was supposed to start school
in september. you wouldn't listen.
get up. get up!
get out here.
give me that book.
dearest pie, how old is matilda?
four
i'm 6 and a half, mommy.
five, then.
i was 6 in august.
you're a liar.
i wanna go to school.
school!
out of the question. who would be
here to sign for the packages?
we can't leave valuable packages
sitting out on the doorstep.
now, go watch tv
like a good kid.
you know, sometimes i think there's
something wrong with that girl.
hm. tell me about it.
mm.
hey, dip-face,
have a marshmallow.
have another marshmallow, dip-face!
dip-face!
[sobbing quietly]
<i>narrator: sometimes matilda
longed for a friend.</i>
<i>someone like the kind,
courageous people in her books.</i>
<i>it occurred to her that
like talking dragons and princesses</i>
<i>with hair long enough to climb, such
people might exist only in storybooks.</i>
<i>but matilda was about to discover
that she could be her own friend.</i>
<i>that she had a kind of strength
she wasn't even aware of.</i>
i'm great! i'm incredible!
michael, pencil and paper,
in the kitchen.
did we sell some cars today,
honeydew?
did we!
does that mean
i can get that new tv?
yeah. son, one day you're gonna
have to earn your own living.
it's time you learned
the family business.
sit down. write this down.
all right. the first car your
brilliant father sold cost $320.
i sold it for $1158.
the second one cost $512.
mm-hm.
i sold it for $2269.
wait, dad, you're going too fast.
just write.
the third cost $68.
i sold it for $999.
and the fourth cost $1100.
i sold it for 7839
big american boffos.
harry!
what was my profit for the day?
could you repeat the last one--?
$10,265.
check it if you don't believe me.
you're a little cheat.
you saw the paper.
from all the way over here?
are you being smart with me?
if you're being smart with me, young
lady, you're gonna be punished.
punished for being smart?
for being a smart aleck.
when a person is bad, that person
has to be taught a lesson.
person?
get up!
get up.
narrator: harry wormwood
<i>had unintentionally
given his daughter</i>
<i>the first practical advice
she could use.</i>
<i>he meant to say,
"when a child is bad."</i>
<i>instead he said,
"when a person is bad."</i>
<i>and thereby introduced
a revolutionary idea</i>
<i>that children could
punish their parents.</i>
<i>only when they deserved it,
of course.</i>

what do you say?
i don't know.
what do you say, dad?
i say appearance

people don't buy a car,
they buy me.
which is why i personally
take such pride in my appearance.
well-oiled hair,

i paid $100 for it.
she's got 120,000 miles on her.
transmission shot,
bumpers have fallen off.
what do i do with her? hm?
i sell her.
we really should weld
these bumpers on,
but that takes time,
equipment, money.
so we use
super super glue instead.
go ahead, put it on there.
won't it fall off?
definitely.
isn't that dangerous?
not to me, okay?

i'm taking you all to café le ritz.

double bingo, huh? ooh.
god, your hair looks awful.
i hope they let you in.
they'll let me in.
matilda: here's your hat, daddy.
get in the car.
go on, get in.
how much?
it's for me to know
and you to find out.
[blows raspberry]
it's nice to go out sometimes.
yeah.
you never take us out.
of course i do.
i took you to the flipper.
i don't remember any of the flipper.
harry: the fish joint.
you found that comb
in the bouillabaisse.
zinnia:
oh, yeah. i like that joint.

i can't get it off. i can't get it off.
just a minute. i'm gonna yank

fibers are fused?
what is that supposed to mean?

harry:
i will not be the figure of ridicule!
i want respect, and i want it now!
[groaning]
i still don't see how you
glued your hat on, harry.
i mean, i know you say you didn't,
but obviously you did.
i did not glue my hat to my head.
the hat shrunk,
the fibers fused to my hair. ow.
zinnia: baby, wait a minute.
i'm getting it now.
i'm getting it. one more.
oh, my god.

moby what?
this is filth! trash! here.
it's not mine! it's a library book.

i'm fed up with all this reading! you're

<i>man: producers are not liable for any skin

[harry & zinnia laughing]
<i>[♪♪♪]</i>
[zinnia screaming]
i didn't do it.
of course you didn't do it,

i told you that was

it's not a cheap set,
it's a stolen set.
put your light on!
bummer.
<i>narrator:
was it magic or coincidence?</i>
<i>she didn't know.</i>
<i>it is said that we humans use
only a tiny portion of our brains.</i>
<i>matilda might never have discovered

<i>were it not for the events

trunchbull: i need a car,
inexpensive but reliable.
can you service me?
harry: in a manner of speaking, yes.
welcome to wormwood motors.
harry wormwood,
owner, founder, whatever.
agatha trunchbull, principal,
crunchem hall elementary school.
i warn you, sir, i want a tight
car, because i run a tight ship.
oh, yeah, huh? well, uh--
my school is a model of discipline.
“use the rod, beat the child,"
that's my motto.
terrific motto.
you have brats yourself?
yeah, i got a boy, mikey,
and one mistake, matilda.
they're all mistakes, children. filthy,
nasty things. glad i never was one.
uh-huh. well, since you're an educator,
i'm gonna make you a great deal.
you had better.
let's do business.
thank you.
enjoy it.
hey, you, you're going to school.
i am?
first thing tomorrow.
yeah, yeah, okay, okay. you'll get
a real education at this place.
<i>[♪♪♪]</i>
<i>narrator: matilda had always wanted to
go to school because she loved to learn.</i>
<i>she tried to imagine
what her new school would be like.</i>
go ahead.
go ahead.
<i>narrator: she pictured a lovely
building surrounded by trees</i>
<i>and flowers and swings.</i>
<i>well, there was a building</i>
<i>and children.</i>
<i>so regardless of what
crunchem hall looked like,</i>
<i>she was happy to be there.</i>
hey, wait up!
<i>narrator: after all, any school
is better than no school at all.</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>
[children shriek]
<i>[♪♪♪]</i>
trunchbull:
you, detention.
you're too small.
grow up quicker!
heads up! shoulders back!
stomachs in! stand straight.
hey-
sorry-
trunchbull:
detention for you.
that's okay. it's much better
than being out there.
is that my teacher?
no, that's the principal,
miss trunchbull.
you've gotta be kidding.
uh-uh.
you squirts better skedaddle.
i'm not kidding.
the trunchbull likes to snap a whip
in there to see who's trying to hide.
trunchbull:
stomach in!
change those socks! too pink.
i'm matilda.
lavender.
i'm hortensia.
matilda & lavender: hi.
she doesn't really hit children
with that riding crop, does she?
no, it's mostly for scare.
what she does is worse.
like yesterday, in the second grade,
the trunchbull makes a weekly visit
to every classroom to show the teachers
a thing or two about handling kids.
and julius rottwinkle ate
<i>two m&m's during her lesson.
matilda: and she caught him?</i>
<i>hortensia:
of course.</i>
[all gasp]
[screaming]
was julius okay?
after being thrown out the window?
of course he wasn't okay.
he lived, if that's what you mean.
the trunchbull used
to be in the olympics.
shot put, javelin, hammer throw.
hortensia:
the hammer throw is her specialty.
so she does this all the time?
better than being put in the choky.
choky?
hortensia: yeah, the choky.
it's a tall, narrow hole
in the wall behind a door.
<i>you have to stand
in a drippy pipe with jagged edges.</i>
<i>and the walls have broken glass
and nails sticking out.</i>
trunchbull: get inside, you
festering ball of pus!
<i>matilda: she puts kids in there?
hortensia: i've been in twice.</i>
<i>sometimes she leaves you
in there all day.</i>
didn't you tell your parents?
hortensia: they didn't believe me.
i mean, would your parents
believe it?
trunchbull: sixty lines after school:
“i must obey miss trunchbull."
no.
trunchbull: out of my way.
here she comes.
ahh, fresh meat.
amanda thripp.
yes, miss trunchbull.
what are those?
what's what, miss trunchbull?
trunchbull:
hanging down by your ears.
you mean my pigtails?
are you a pig, amanda?
no, miss trunchbull.
do i allow pigs in my school?
my mommy thinks they're sweet.
your mommy is a twit!
you'll chop those off
before school tomorrow or i will--
but--
but?!
i don't--
but? did you say "but"?
what? hammer throw.
definitely.
i'll give you "but"!
child 1: good loft!
child 2: and excellent release.
[screaming]
think she'll make the fence?
gonna be a close one.
<i>[♪♪♪]</i>
[all cheering]
quiet! get to class
before i throw you all in the choky.
lavender.
what's my teacher like?
trunchbull:
run, run, run. faster! get in.
quickly!
narrator:
<i>but matilda's teacher, miss honey,</i>
<i>was one of those
remarkable people</i>
<i>who appreciates every single child
for who she or he is.</i>
i scooped these up for you,
miss honey.
oh, how lovely.
thank you, amanda.
okay, listen up, everybody.
we have a new student with us today.
this is matilda wormwood. i'd like
you to sit over here with lavender.
now, you all remember how scary
your first days at school were.
so i'd like you to be especially nice to
matilda and make her feel welcome, all right?
could you get her
workbook for her, please?
yes, miss honey.
you can sit down.
<i>narrator: miss honey was a wonderful
teacher and a friend to everyone.</i>
<i>but her life was not as simple
and beautiful as it seemed.</i>
<i>miss honey had a deep,
dark secret.</i>
<i>though it caused her great pain,</i>
<i>she did not let it interfere
with her teaching.</i>
well, matilda, you've come
on a very good day,
because we're going to review
everything that we've learned so far.
now, it's all right if you don't understand
any of this because you're brand-new.
but if you do know an answer,
just raise your hand. okay?
all right. we've been working
on our two-times tables.
would anyone like
to demonstrate?
okay.
let's do some together.
two times four is?
children: eight.
two times six is?
children: twelve.
two times nine is?
children: eighteen.
excellent! you've been practicing.
pretty soon you'll be able to do
any multiplication,
whether it's two times seven...
children: fourteen.
very good. or 13 times 379.
i beg your pardon?
i think that's the answer.
<i>[♪♪♪]</i>
it is.
wow.
matilda, you know how
to multiply big numbers?
i read this book last year
on mathematics at the library.
you like to read?
oh, yes, i love to read.
what do you like to read?
everything, but lately i've
been reading darles chickens.
charles dickens.
i could read him every day.
so could i.
all right, everyone,
take out your workbooks
and let's start with section three.
i'll be back in a moment.
trunchbull: yippee! gotcha right in the neck!
and you. woo-hoo!
yes! you-- come in, come in,
whoever you are.
[gasps]
almost got you.
good to see you, jen.
good, good, good.
time for one of our
little heart-to-hearts?
[both chuckle]
actually, it's about the new girl
in my class, miss trunchbull,
matilda wormwood.
her father says she's a real wart.
a what?
a carbuncle, a blister, a festering
pustule of malignant ooze.
oh, no, matilda wormwood
is a very sweet girl, and very bright.
a bright child?
yes. she can multiply
large sums in her head.
so can a calculator.
well, i think she might be happier
in an older and more advanced class.
ah, i knew it!
you can't handle the little viper, so you're trying
to foist her off on one of the other teachers.
no, no, no, miss trunchbull.
yes!
typical, slothful cowardice.
listen to me, jen.
the distance the shot put goes depends
upon the effort you put into it.
perspiration!
if you can't handle the little brat,
i'll lock her in the choky!
get it?
yes, ma'am.
one day, jen, you'll see that
everything i do is for your own good,
and the good of those
putrescent little children!
<i>[♪♪♪]</i>
[indistinct radio chatter]
zinnia:
get back at tiffany. before.
when she was having that--
mom, i'm home.
zinnia: how was school?
school was great.
my teacher lets me do
sixth-grade work. look.
algebra and geography.
hold on a minute.
can't you see i'm in the middle
of an important phone call?
well, you just asked me
how school was.
quiet.
what else was she supposed
to do? the baby wasn't his.
well, it was really great.
no way. they gotta be implants.
the principal is insane. she threw
a girl over the fence by her hair.
it would change your life too if
you waxed yours, i'm positive.
i have the most
wonderful teacher.
mine are driving me crazy.
i'm telling you, six hours a day
at school is not enough.
i'll say.
hiyah. whack to the belly! a smack to the face.
another smack to the face!
burns is hurt. he's on the
ropes, ladies and gentlemen.
[doorbell rings]
saved by the bell.
packages at this hour?

what?
okay.
hello.
we don't give money. we don't like charities.
we don't buy raffle tickets.
mr. wormwood.
i'm jennifer honey.
i'm matilda's teacher.
what has she done now?
you! go to your room
right now! right now. beat it!
look, whatever it is,
she's your problem now.
no, there is no problem.
then beat it. we're watching tv.
mr. wormwood, if you think
watching some rotten tv show
is more important than your daughter,
then maybe you shouldn't be a parent.
now, why don't you turn that
darn thing off and listen to me?
[groans]
all right, come in.
get this over with.
mrs. wormwood's not gonna
like this. come on, get in.
close the door.
who is it?
some teacher.
says she's gotta talk
to you about matilda.
what did you do that for?
he had velasquez on the ropes.
what do you want?
i'm sure you're aware by now that
matilda has a brilliant mind.
yeah, right.
mikey, get me a beer.
her math skills
are simply extraordinary.
she's reading material that i--
want one?
oh, no, thank you, dear.
material that i didn't see
until my second year of college.
oh, college.
great, college.
i really feel,
with private instruction
that she'd be ready for college
in just a few short years.
look, miss snit.
a girl does not get anywhere
by acting intelligent.
i mean, take a look
at you and me.
you chose books.
i chose looks.
i have a nice house,
a wonderful husband,
and you are slaving away teaching
snot-nosed children their abc's.
you want matilda to go to college?
ha-ha-ha.
college! i didn't go to college.
i don't know anybody who did.
bunch of hippies and cesspool salesmen.
ha-ha-ha.
don't sneer at educated people,
mr. wormwood.
if you became ill,
heaven forbid,
your doctor would be
a college graduate.
or say you were sued
for selling a faulty car.
the lawyer who defended you
would've gone to college too.
what car? sued by who?
who you been talking to?
nobody.
oh, dear, i can see
we're not going to agree, are we?
no. i'm sorry i burst in
on you like this.
sorry.
zinnia: we ought to sue her
for interrupting our show.
tell me about it.
why's he in the middle of the ring?
zinnia: he's standing in the middle
of the ring because it's over.
[whispering]
thank you.
harry: we missed it?
[whispering] tomorrow.
zinnia: great, it's over.
who won?
how do i know?
you shut it off!
harry: was it my fault that she
came in the middle of the fight?
trunchbull:
<i>hop to. hippity-hop.</i>
<i>the entire school will go

i don't know what
you're talking about.
cake. chocolate cake.
you slithered like a serpent
into the school kitchen
and ate my personal snack!
do you deny it?
confess!
well, it's hard for me
to remember a specific cake.
this one
was mine.
and it was the most scrumptious
cake in the entire world.
my mom's is better.
[children gasp]
it is, is it?
how can you be sure
unless you have another piece?
sit down, bog.
[gulps]
[all gasp]
here we go.
smells chocolaty, eh?
now, eat it!
i don't want any, thank you.

mm. mm-hm. yeah.

you look like you enjoyed that,
brucey.
yes, ma'am.
you must have some more.
oh, no, thanks.
but you'll hurt cook's feelings.
huh?
cookie.
[children gasp]
she made this cake just for you
to have on your very own.
her sweat and blood
went into this cake
and you will not leave this platform until
you have consumed the entire confection!
entire confection.
see you at lunch.
thank you, cookie.
rotten kids.
you wanted cake, you got cake.
now, eat it!

any children who object
will go straight into the choky

young lady, where were you?
miss trunchbull kept the whole school late
because this boy ate some chocolate cake.
that's the biggest lie i ever heard.
you see those packages over there?
they were left out for the world to see
because you weren't here to take them in.
i don't think it's fair, bumpkins.
what?
you get all this stuff from
catalogs, and i don't get anything.
it's not catalogs, it's car parts, sweetness.
it's business.
oh, if it's business, why don't
you have it sent to the office?
because the cops may
be watching the office.
the cops are watching
the house.
what?
they're parked outside right now.
you are such an ignoramus.
those are speedboat salesmen.
really nice guys.
cops.
speedboats? there are
no lakes around here.
yeah, but some people like
to go away on the weekends.
some people have fun.

they are not cops.

they are not. i ought to know

a frog!
lavender:
it's a salamander.
it's a chameleon.
matilda: it's a newt.

salamanders from the genus triturus."
“some are brightly colored and

lavender:
miss honey!
miss trunchbull teaches
our class today, lavender.
please get a water pitcher.
but miss honey--
shh, shh. quickly. she'll be
here any second. come on.
make sure the water's cold, lavender.
hurry. vinnie, cover the fish.
put away the art projects.
put away anything colorful.
oh, charlie, won't you get
those crayons for me.
<i>narrator: most great ideas come from
hard work and careful planning.</i>
<i>of course, once in a while,

honey: raina, cover the birds and beetles.
hurry! hurry!
i hear her coming.
okay, now,
last time, some of you
forgot yourselves.
don't speak unless you're spoken to.
don't laugh. don't smile.
don't even breathe loudly.
trunchbull:
don't breathe at all.
morning, miss trunchbull.
children:
good morning, miss trunchbull.
sit!
shoo!
trunchbull: i have never been able to understand
why small children are so disgusting.
they're the bane of my life.
they're like insects.
[mouthing] where's <i>matilda?</i>
trunchbull: they should be got
rid of as early as possible.
fsht!
my idea of a perfect school
is one in which there
are no children at all.
do you agree, miss honey?
now,
you, front of the class!
<i>[♪♪♪]</i>
are you okay?
trunchbull: next time i tell you to empty
your pockets, you'll do it faster, won't you?
boy: yes, miss trunchbull.
trunchbull: miss honey.
this could be the most interesting
thing you've ever done.
sit down, you squirming
worm of vomit!
thank you, miss trunchbull.
get up!
can you spell?
miss honey taught us how
to spell a long word yesterday.
we can spell "difficulty."
you couldn't spell "difficulty"
if your life depended on it.
she taught us with a poem.
[in high-pitched voice]
a poem, how sweet.
<i>what poem would that be?
mrs. d, mrs. i</i>
children:
mrs. f-f-i
<i>mrs. c, mrs. u
mrs. l-t-y</i>
[in normal voice] why are
all these women married?
mrs. d? mrs. i? you're supposed
to be teaching spelling, not poetry!
i cannot, for the life of me, understand why
small children take so long to grow up.
i think they do it deliberately
just to annoy me.
[murmuring]
shh, shh, shh, shh.
[children laughing]
what's funny? hm?
come on, spit it out.
speak up.
i like a joke as well
as the next fat person.
ah! it's a snake. it's a snake!
it's a snake! uch!
one of you tried
to poison me. who?
matilda.
i knew it!
i just thought you'd like to know,
it's not a snake. it's a newt.
what did you say?
it's a newt.
stand up, you villainous sack
of goat slime! you did this.
no, miss trunchbull.
did you act alone,
or did you have accomplices?
i didn't do it.
you didn't like
the choky, did you?
thought you'd
pay me back, didn't you?
well, i'll pay you back,
young lady.
for what, miss trunchbull?
for this newt, you piss-worm!
i'm telling you, i didn't do it!
besides, even if you didn't
do it, i'm gonna punish you
because i'm big and you're small,
and i'm right and you're wrong.
and there's nothing
you can do about it.
you're a liar and a scoundrel,
and your father's a liar and a cheat.
you're the most corrupt lowlifes
in the history of civilization.
am i wrong'? i'm never wrong.
in this classroom,
in this school, i am god!
[grunting]
[children laughing]
<i>[♪♪♪]</i>
you!
i didn't move.
you did this!
how could she possibly have done it
when she was sitting way over here?
i'll be watching you,
each and every one.
when you turn the corner,
when you go to your cubbies
to get your smelly coats,
when you skip merrily to lunch,
i'll be watching you, all of you,
and especially you.
oh, sweetheart, i'm sorry.
thanks for not telling.
best friends don't tell.
she can really dance.
i'm gonna clean up this mess, and then i'll
come and help you fill the bird feeder, okay?
i'll be out there in a minute.
miss honey?
yes, matilda?
miss honey, i did it.
did what?
i made the glass tip over.
oh, sweetheart, don't let miss
trunchbull make you feel that way.
nobody did it.
it was an accident.
i did it with my eyes.
watch, i'll prove it to you.
it's wonderful you feel
so powerful.
many people don't feel
powerful at all.
[whispering] come on, tip over, you glass.
glass, tip over. tip over.
come on, tip over.
tip over, glass.
it's all right, matilda.
[sighs]
[in normal voice]
i really did do it, miss honey.
one of the odd things about life
is sometimes you can do something
until you wanna show someone,
and then you can't.
or sometimes you think something's broken
and then you take it to be fixed--
this isn't like that.
oh.
i don't know.
maybe i made myself tired.
matilda, would you like to come
over to my house this afternoon?
i'd like that very much,
miss honey.
good.
<i>[♪♪♪]</i>
matilda: i just stare very hard,
and then my eyes get all hot,
and i can feel the strongness.
i feel like i can move
almost anything in the world.
you do believe me,
don't you?
oh, i believe that you should
believe in whatever power
you think you have inside of you.
believe it with all your heart.
that's where
miss trunchbull lives.
matilda:
why is there a swing?
a girl i know used to live in that house.
her life was good and happy.
<i>when she was just 2 years old,
her mother died.</i>
<i>her father was a doctor,</i>
<i>and he needed someone
to look after things at home,</i>
<i>so he invited the mother's stepsister
to come and live with him.</i>
<i>but the girl's aunt was a mean person
who treated the girl very badly.</i>
<i>matilda: the trunchbull.
honey: yes.</i>
<i>and worst of all,
when the girl was 5, her father died.</i>
<i>matilda:
how did her father die?</i>
<i>honey: the police decided
he'd killed himself.</i>
<i>matilda:
why would he do such a thing?</i>
<i>honey:
no one knows.</i>
the end is happier.
she found a small cottage.
she rented it from this lovely
rhubarb farmer for just $50 a month
and she covered it in honeysuckle, and
she planted hundreds of wildflowers
and she moved out of her wicked aunt's
house and she finally got her freedom.
good for her.
do you know why i told you this?
no.
you were born into a family that
doesn't always appreciate you,
but one day, things are
gonna be very different.
should we go inside
and have tea and cookies?
yes, please.
okay.
this is the cottage from your story.
yes.
the young woman is you.
but then--
no.
yes.
aunt trunchbull.
when i left my home,
aunt trunchbull's home,
i had to leave
all my treasures behind.
treasures?
photographs of my mother and father,
and a beautiful doll my mother
gave me with a china face.
lissy doll, i called her.
would you like some milk?
yes, please.
why don't you run away?
i've often thought about it,
but i can't abandon my children.
and if i couldn't teach,
i'd have nothing at all.
you're very brave, miss honey.
not as brave as you.
i thought grownups
weren't afraid of anything.
quite the contrary.
all grownups get scared,
just like children.
i wonder what
miss trunchbull is afraid of.
<i>[♪♪♪]</i>
matilda:
there she is.
shot put.
honey:
hammer throw.
honey & matilda:
javelin.
[cat meowing]
back, back, back, back!
she's afraid of a cat?
black cats.
she's very superstitious.
trunchbull:
go!
[mimics dog barking]
go!
[yells]
oh.
matilda:
poor kitty.
oh, he's all right.
hopefully.
let's go get your treasures.
no, matilda.
well, she's gone. come on.
matilda!
miss honey.
trunchbull: come on, move, you
piece of junkyard fodder.
shift, you-- no, no.
honey:
my house.
oh, my.
my father's portrait
used to hang there.
matilda: whoever painted the trunchbull
must have had a strong stomach.
a really strong stomach.
[grunting]
[yells]
we should go.
father's chocolate box.
after supper, he'd take
a chocolate, cut it in half,
and he'd always
give me the bigger half.
when he died, trunchbull would count
them so i couldn't even sneak one.
she'd take a chocolate,
bring it to her lips and say:
much too good for children.
have one.
no, she'd notice.
where's lissy doll?
upstairs.
[gasps]
matilda.
<i>[♪♪♪]</i>

[honey shrieks
then matilda chuckles]
honey:
matilda.
[trunchbull
muttering indistinctly]
you filthy--
crush the little weasel!
honey:
this is my room.
that's my dad.
matilda: what's his name?
magnus.
i used to call him king magnus
and he called me bumblebee.
i don't think magnus
killed himself.
neither do i.
is that lissy doll?
trunchbull: wormwood, you
useless, used-car-salesman scum!
i want you around here now
with another car!
yes, i know what caveat emptor
means, you lowlife liar!
i'm gonna sue you. i'm gonna
burn down your showroom!
i'm gonna take that no-good jalopy you
sold me and shove it up your bazooga!
when i'm finished with you,
you're gonna look like roadkill!

yeah. yeah, go.

[grunts then yelling]
oh, my goodness.
feel my heart.
weren't you the most scared
you've ever been in your whole life?
[door closes]
come on, let's go.
she shouldn't be allowed
to treat people like that.
somebody's gotta teach her a lesson.
i know.
we'll wait until she leaves again,
then we'll go get your doll.
