i heard you interfering little bastards
rummage around my yard.
i'll thank you for keeping the owls off of my cats.
you sleep ok?
sorta.
i, uh...
god, jean, i don't know what happened.
it's like a red mist or...
something comes over me and i...
but i feel like you backed me up in a corner and i...
you do that, and uh...
i hate it when i'm like that.
i'm sorry.
can you forgive me?
what?!
fuck!
you promised...
if it happened again...
you promised.
ok, this is last week and up to yesterday.
- all right?
- ok.
- i stuck an extra 50 bucks in there.
- kitty, i can't...
- you can. listen...
- here, just take it.
i don't wanna see you coming around here
anymore looking like this.
you take care.
take care of that girl. get going. ok.
we have a reciprocity agreement with kansas.
if you can stay in this shelter for a week.
- i could find you a place in wichita.
- no.
every man in town who beats a woman
knows where this shelter is.
do you have someone you can stay with?
i don't think you really understand
just how worried i am.
i don't know.
maybe they went shopping.
i wish someone in this goddamn place would just...
would just give me the truth.
then we could find jean pretty damn quick.
tribune, kansas.
do you wanna go there?
sure. maybe. i mean,
we can go anywhere we want.
how about loving, new mexico?
- i like that.
- me too.
topeka.
santa cruz.
oh, my gosh.
there's a butt, montana.
it's pronounced "bute."
- mom?
- oh, no. no!
hey!
she's not going anywhere.
there's a rod sticking through the block.
i'm heading to sioux falls.
yeah.
just take what you need.
so one inch is 83 miles.
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
aloha, oregon.
it's only ten inches away.
so that's 830 miles and we've already gone 300 miles...
we're going to wyoming.
what's in wyoming?
it's where your grandfather lives.
i have a grandfather?
not much of one.
when were you going to tell me?
oh, i'm fine.
smells like rain.
it's not gonna rain today.
you haven't been right about the weather since 1972.
i know what rain looks like.
you got something on your mind this morning?
the goddamn bear's back.
well, what do you think you're gonna do about it?
what i should have done a year ago.
did anyone notice if he had cubs?
did you see cubs with him?
ok.
- it's under control, einar.
- you get out of the way and it will be.
come on, let's let the fish and game take care of this.
this isn't some pet dog they're after.
i think they can tell the difference, all right?
that says what a college education gets you.
here we go.
mom.
welcome to wyoming.
mom, this is us.
so is my grandpa nice?
why didn't you tell me about him?
einar!
i don't want you here.
at least we agree on something.
i don't wanna be here either.
we need a place to stay for about a month or so.
looks like you need every part of your head examined.
is this yours?
she's yours too.
you telling me i have a grandchild i don't know about?
i'm telling you i was pregnant at griffin's funeral.
where you been till now?
we've been on the road for two days.
we lived in iowa.
now this suddenly seems like home?
what's her name?
my name's griff.
griff gilkyson.
that's an unusual name for a girl.
einar, please.
just till i can earn enough to get us out of here.
there's a room in the basement.
i'm sorry.
hey. i'm gonna go into town
and look for a job.
you think you'll be all right here?
all right, well, just... be good.
love you.
i used the bathroom.
i heard you.
- are you hungry?
- not yet.
is there a mcdonald's in town?
- you got five dollars?
- no, i don't.
well, then i don't think going into town
for a meal would be a very good idea.
how was your night?
all right, i guess.
left or right?
let's do the right.
left could use a rest.
pain bad all the time now?
gets my full attention.
yep.
what happened with my bear?
it's his own damn bear.
you telling me he's still alive?
he's fine.
he's in that zoo angie built.
dreaming about the sea last night.
did you get wet?
i walked right in.
felt like falling in love.
smelled like a woman.
tasted like one too.
your memory's not that good.
hey.
down there.
see jean kept her looks.
said she brought her daughter with her.
she says it's griffin's.
granddaughter.
that's a nice thing for a man to have.
i might go into town for breakfast.
all right.
taking the girl with you?
anything else you need?
yeah, look in on the bear.
- what?
- check on the bear.
check on the...?
why the hell would i do that?
'cause i asked you to.
are those my dad's things?
yeah, they are.
where does he live now?
he's dead.
didn't your mother tell you that?
yeah. but she said you were dead too.
are you confused about why they call
a room with a table in it a dining room?
no, sir.
since it looks like you didn't have
any trouble making that sandwich,
i'd like you to make another one at 11:30.
will you do that?
- yes, sir.
- and take it to that man in the little house.
and a glass of milk.
yes, sir.
bear? goddammit.
"go check on the bear."
goddammit.
nice wheels, einar!
where did you get the rig?
nancy sidwell had this shipped up from
that retirement village where ernie died.
maybe it was the bike killed ernie.
what killed ernie was a lifetime of nancy's cooking.
- your pickup broke down again?
- oh, hell, no. pickup's fine.
i'm just out here training for a goddamn marathon.
i like the flag. without an orange flag
like that, you might look ridiculous.
- hello, ken, catherine.
- einar.
what have i got? bills.
- morning, einar.
- morning yourself, nina.
do you believe they're still sending junk mail to my boy?
well, maybe the dead are flattered
to get a letter. ever think about that?
i'll let you know when i'm gone.
maybe i'll send you a postcard from the other side.
hey, how's mitch doing?
mitch - he's dreaming about the sea.
oh, yeah?
i used to live by the ocean.
up in oregon for about a year.
yeah, too much rain if you ask me.
but i sure like the sound it makes.
- grandma.
- what's up?
if you get depressed, pull up a chair
to your kitchen sink and turn on the tap.
if i ever get depressed,
remind me not to come to you for advice.
hey!
i wonder if it's hard being that drunk
this early in the morning.
oh, it's easy if you don't stop drinking all night.
- you'd know. how do you want your eggs?
- scrambled.
hey, there, boys.
what can i get you this morning?
get down on this table and i can see if
i can stay on you till the buzzer sounds.
ugh! i hope you're
having a lot of fun, chris,
'cause soon as i get one arm free,
i'm gonna kick your sorry ass.
oh, now look what you went and did!
good morning, fellas.
i'm gonna be your new waiter.
want some coffee?
- why don't you screw off, you old bastard?
- what?
son, now i don't wanna work myself short of breath.
you wanna continue this?
it can be over all at once.
because that's how goddamn fast your life can change.
you believe me?
sorry for the mess.
- hi.
- hi.
my name's griff.
my name is mitch.
that for me?
thank you.
yeah, i know.
i almost threw up first time i looked at it.
you feeling a little queasy?
i'm fine.
ok.
i got queasy first time i saw a man eat a snail.
- you ever eat a snail?
- no.
me neither.
this looks good.
- what happened to you?
- i was mauled by a bear.
i saw a bear in a cage yesterday.
yeah. that was my bear.
about a year ago, he was eating
one of your grandfather's calves
and... well, we sort of
interrupted his dinner, you know.
he thought we were gonna take it away from him.
you know bears -
they don't like to share.
did the bear bite einar?
no, i was closer.
- i didn't know anyone ate snails.
- oh, yeah, sure.
in those fancy restaurants up in cheyenne,
they eat 'em all the time like there's nothing to it.
once i saw this kid eat a moth.
- you could hear the crunch.
- oh, no, no!
oh, my gosh! look at that!
einar.
hey, angie.
i didn't expect to see you in this crowd.
i guess at my age it's good
to be seen just about anywhere.
well, fish and game said he'd settle down in a few days.
of course, they also said
he'd eat anything, which he doesn't.
i don't get it. nobody would pay five dollars
for the mountain lion i used to keep in here.
how's mitch?
he's dreaming about the sea.
i always wanted a boat.
my dad used to take us out.
it was so great.
what happened to the lion?
he died.
lucky lion.
hello, griffin.
well, it says here you might have
already won $15 million.
probably ought to send it in for you, though.
probably the same damn odds as losing a kid early.
you got that done.
you should know your wife came back.
you could have steered her someplace else.
just 'cause you're dead doesn't mean you can't be useful.
see you tomorrow, boy.
kid sure looks a whole lot like you, though.
top to bottom.
mom!
- hey!
- i missed you.
- guess what. i got a job.
- really?
i start tomorrow.
so how was your day?
not so great, huh?
man, i'm tired.
i think half the people we served
this morning came in just to look at you.
here you go.
- what's this?
- your half of the tips.
i thought you said you were used to being on your feet.
i'm not used to telling everyone i meet
where i've been the last ten years.
well...
tell 'em you went crazy.
tell 'em you've been locked up.
that's what i've been telling 'em.
looks like we did real good today.
guess i got you to thank for that.
maybe i'll have some music on saturday night.
of course, then again,
you'd have to dance with billy and wayne.
oh, that'd be a sight.
can i help you?
i'm einar gilkyson's daughter-in-law.
yes, i know.
did you want to come in?
thank you.
- any calls?
- nothing.
homemade lunch, you know.
you got something there you want me to see?
it's a police report.
but i didn't press charges.
a shelter worker in iowa thought i ought to
check in with authorities when i got settled.
he was my boyfriend.
but, um...
the report's not for this time.
it was for another time.
i'll make a copy.
that's it.
what are their names?
- who?
- your cats.
they don't have any names.
how do you tell 'em apart?
i don't tell 'em apart.
goddamn cheap-ass, mickey mouse,
foreign goddamn part...
oscar and charlie.
hi, charlie.
is that there a water-pump belt?
why don't you use the one out on the tractor?
why don't i use the one out on the tractor?
hey, are you mumbling over there or something?
the tractor belt's twice this size.
- really?
- yeah.
oh.
don't we have some spare belts in the barn?
i got a great idea.
why don't you go back in the house?
well, uh, damn. i was...
just trying to be helpful.
if you don't want my help,
i'll just sit over here and shut up.
pulling that out, it don't look like
you know what you're doing.
just shut up! ok?
shut up. you don't know what i'm doing.
- you don't know about the truck.
- who you talking to?
- stop being a philosopher...
- doggone second-generation immigrant,
i bet i come over there and hang my bad foot in your ass.
- thanks.
- anytime.
- see you tomorrow?
- yep. see ya.
- hey, kiddo.
- hey.
- how was it?
- all right.
- see ya, einar.
- got some groceries for dinner.
ok.
- do you wanna take these inside, sweetie?
- sure.
- got it?
- yep.
- hey, mitch.
- hey, there.
what happened here?
why did you stop running cows?
when griffin died, i ran out of help.
then i got older, mitch got mauled,
and i sold the stock to stay on the place.
dinner will be ready in an hour.
come here, sarah.
nope, stay here.
- you finished?
- yeah.
tell your kid to come down out of that tree.
come on, charlie.
come on.
don't be a fraidy-cat.
oh, jesus.
i'm sorry.
you're sorry, huh?
well, that's just fine, then.
- i'll buy you a new one.
- oh. just that easy?
maybe i liked that plate. in fact, maybe
that was my favorite goddamn plate!
- it's just a plate.
- that's it, huh?
did it ever occur to you
that not everything can be replaced?
come down out of that tree!
- you want this on the table?
- no, over here. thank you.
i'm so glad you're back, jean.
what happened to nellie?
nellie left.
about a year after we buried griffin.
einar just never got a handle on it.
and then, when he hardly
even noticed nellie anymore, why...
she found another man.
who wouldn't?
think they live in colorado.
do you think he blames me for losing his wife too?
i imagine he does.
i don't want to stay here.
what's wrong with him?
well, it's not you.
he just never got over it.
he really loved your dad.
you should know that.
- did you?
- of course.
you do have a plan, though, right?
i mean, we don't have to stay here forever?
sure, i do.
soon as i earn enough money,
i'm gonna get us right out of here.
you know what?
what do you think about...
butt, montana?
come on, let's play.
you don't know how to read anymore?
where'd the bottle come from?
the granary.
it's been there for a while.
sometimes i just like to look at it.
you gonna open it?
i'm not sure yet. 25.
- did you check on the bear?
- eight.
yeah, you asked me to, didn't you?
here's a pair for two.
i want you to feed him.
- what?
- i want you to feed the bear.
i don't trust angie to feed anything much past herself.
"feed the bear." "please feed the bear."
"bear, do you like bear shoes?"
"what kind of food do you like, bear?
steak, chicken?"
- einar.
- what?
is her being here gonna ruin you?
- the woman killed my son.
- oh, come on.
it was a car accident. they call them
accidents because it's nobody's fault.
no, they call them accidents
to make the guilty feel better.
- is that so?
- i don't give a damn what they call them.
my son's dead.
your granddaughter's not.
and neither were you.
have you thought about how she's gonna remember you?
you know, come to think of it,
i don't feel like playing cards tonight.
put that bottle someplace
where i don't have to look at it.
you know anything about pickup trucks?
aw, shit.
hand me that half-inch
socket wrench, would you?
no, no, no.
shiny one on the top.
yep.
do you wanna see what i'm doing?
that's it.
- ok, see these screws here?
- mm-hm.
this one i'm tightening, this holds
this thing up which holds the pan up.
if this thing comes loose when you're
driving, you'll be sitting on the road.
and that's not what you want to be doing...
how come you and einar don't get along?
you're practically his daughter.
what i am is his dead son's wife.
he's always been really good to me.
he's the first friend i met here.
i am not in the mood for their crap.
i'll take 'em.
- the special today is the enchilada plate.
- thank you.
they're good enchiladas.
served by good people.
i'm a good person.
i'm also a woman who's taken more
than her fair share of shit off men.
don't push me.
i mean, i couldn't even take a pinch of crap
from two little cheesedicks like you.
ok, crank it.
again.
again.
take your foot off the gas.
take your foot off the gas!
is that for lunch?
it's for a bear.
who the hell knows what a bear eats anyway?
did i ask you to do that?
don't bears like honey?
winnie the pooh does.
- oh, hey.
- thought you were sick.
haven't seen you for a few days.
it's only a two-restaurant town, so i try
to spread the county's money around.
meatloaf. can i have onion rings
instead of mashed potatoes?
onion... sure, i'll ask.
could you give me a ride home after work?
sure.
he looks like he's dancing.
well, maybe just happy to see a girl with a sack of meat.
i'll give you some here.
why don't you toss this in?
- he likes the honey.
- i think he does.
is that really the bear
that hurt mr. bradley?
he's the one.
i don't wanna go right home.
- not just yet.
- you don't?
can't we just drive a little?
here's the thing.
i'm gonna be here about three more weeks.
i'm afraid i'm not gonna get through it.
three weeks, huh?
i don't wanna be in love, crane.
don't start without me.
- what's that?
- a flower.
that's not a flower - it's a weed.
it's pretty, though.
- don't you think it's pretty?
- yeah, i think it's lovely.
you want to wait a little longer for your mother?
- just a little bit.
- ok.
i had a music teacher who was a lesbian.
you guys are gay, right?
i'd think after 40 years of working together,
one of us would notice, don't you?
well, einar, i always thought
you had really lovely hands.
you did? you never told me that.
i mean, it's cool.
everybody needs love.
you got that part right, little girl.
jeez, what's next?
hey!
- hey, yourself. how you doing?
- good. how are you?
good. there's somebody
i want you to meet.
griff, this is sheriff curtis.
nice to meet you, griff.
- are you hungry?
- there isn't enough.
i gotta swing back
through town anyway. so i'll see ya.
- thanks for the ride home.
- take care of yourself, crane.
- i don't like him.
- i don't remember asking.
i don't remember you ever asking me.
hey, i don't need your permission.
you confused about how to treat a guest in my house?
it's just some guy my mom brought home.
i expect you to be pleasant to whoever comes to my door.
yes, sir.
unless it's some guy looking to sell his angle on god.
there's no excuse for that bullshit.
well, all right, then. let's give a try
at these good-looking sandwiches.
there you go.
hold it right about here.
ok.
- his foot's not gonna go anywhere.
- oh, yes, it is. look at that calf run.
he's off and gone.
oops. that's a little bit low.
- yeah!
- i got it!
- look at that!
- oh, yeah.
go on, try it again.
there you go.
you got any more improvements you wanna make around here?
i thought i'd straighten some of this mess.
thought mitch might want to work on something.
- did you ask him about it?
- well, of course she did.
now that we've got interesting company around here, i...
i feel inspired.
excuse me.
i gotta go to work.
you wanna know what i dreamed last night?
what?
i dreamed you weren't such a miserable son of a bitch.
that's not dreaming.
that's wishful thinking.
did you hear anything unusual last night?
yeah. somebody poking around
down by the river.
i found some footprints.
this.
i sure do miss smoking.
so do i.
hey.
hey! what are you doing here?
- we're going to angie's zoo.
- really?
what kind of pies you got today, nina?
hey! i got three kinds of berry
and chocolate pecan.
guaranteed to make your teeth ache.
chocolate pecan, please.
with ice cream.
two chocolate pecan, one with ice cream.
kid's got young teeth.
coming right up.
be right back.
crane.
einar.
she capture your interest?
have you thought about the girl?
they're a set.
can i get you anything else, crane?
no. just the check.
ok.
how does the law stand on shooting
somebody on your property?
well, if you didn't want to go to prison,
they'd have to be in your house.
- that's what i thought.
- you think you got a problem?
i'll let you know.
hey.
you wanna hand me that rasp?
no, those are pliers.
the rasp, next to...
- this?
- that's it. yep.
are there really cowgirls?
haven't you ever ridden a horse before?
no. there weren't any horses
around gary's apartment.
he was my mom's boyfriend.
we lived with him for two years.
my mom had another boyfriend before gary.
his name was hank.
he didn't have any horses either.
hank didn't hit my mom like gary did.
he was just mean with his words.
like you.
i can see where not learning to ride a horse
would be a disadvantage for a cowgirl.
- you wanna try?
- yeah.
here, grab that blanket.
what's that?
wanna have a look?
good afternoon, boy.
your father was sure first-rate.
i miss him.
i wish i missed him.
you would if you'd known him.
stay.
your mom's boyfriend in iowa, he smoke?
yeah, a lot.
did he hit you?
mostly my mom.
jimmy. jimmy, no, no.
my parents scraped and saved to get us out of el paso.
to get a quiet place, far away from everything.
then they put an interstate through it.
this would have killed them.
- i remember your parents.
- you do?
- yeah, they were good people.
- what a mess. did you know griffin?
yeah.
he was two years behind me in high school.
do you know how he died?
yeah, it was, uh...
up in calgary at the stampede.
a car accident.
guess everybody in town knows that.
well, it was a long time ago.
i was driving, you know.
guess everybody in town knows that too.
- well, hello.
- hello.
well, i'm not so sure i'm happy
to see you in here, einar.
how about a club soda, eileen?
i can do that for you.
- i hear you have a granddaughter.
- yeah. by god, i do.
how old is she?
she's still shiny. she still expects
everything's gonna turn out all right.
- shit!
- that's a good age.
here, buy yourself a fucking drink.
you're one lucky son of a bitch.
you know those guys?
the one in the hat is jed spear's boy, josh.
and the other guy?
some dude from the midwest.
einar.
- her ex-boyfriend's in town.
- yeah, i know he is.
he's staying down at the sage creek motel.
why in the hell didn't you arrest him?
'cause i can't do anything, except keep
an eye on him. unless he bothers her.
does she know he's here?
i haven't told her yet.
look, if he'd been out at your place,
i could make that enough.
you'd let me know if he'd been out there bothering you?
oh, he doesn't bother me one little bit.
jesus.
here.
bad news.
bad news.
that's 15-2,
that's two runs of three and a pair which puts me out.
- i haven't had a decent hand all night.
- well, don't growl. you dealt half of them.
i'm not growling.
give it here.
- you want some help getting to bed?
- no, i'll manage that.
i always thought this was one of your best.
why, thank you.
ever wish you'd lived a different life rather
than living up here and working with me?
no.
i was always happy that i found work that suited me.
since i was a kid, all i ever wanted to be was a cowboy.
shit.
- how about now?
- now too.
mind if i leave griff here with you
for a while till her mother comes home?
there's an errand in town i'd like to run.
be all right with me if she stayed up here all the time.
hey.
be careful with that errand.
yeah?
take it easy, buddy.
what do you want?
i'm helping you pack.
you don't know how much i love her.
your love was written all over her face
when she got here.
there's nothing more useless than running
after a woman that doesn't want you.
she wanted me to find her. if she didn't,
she wouldn't have come back here.
pull over. here.
keep going.
i see you back here again, i'll kill you.
you've seen too many westerns, old man.
that doesn't exactly work in your favor.
- you need a ride?
- a ride would be fine.
- that man threaten you?
- yeah, he sure as hell did.
jean gilkyson's a friend of mine.
she doesn't want you here.
- you don't know her like i do.
- no, you're right. i don't.
i'll make this simple for you -
i don't want you here.
now, get going.
is this something we're gonna have to talk a lot about?
no, einar.
we never have to talk about this again.
jean?
jean?
- what?
- get dressed. i wanna talk to you.
what is it?
just had a chat with your ex-boyfriend.
thought you oughta know he was in town.
- you mean gary's here?
- he was.
- gary's in town?
- he left.
well, we should call crane.
crane knows all about it.
- i'm sorry.
- tell me something. i'm a little confused.
by bachelor number one and bachelor number two.
are you screwing crane curtis for protection or sport?
would you like to ask your daughter
how she feels about it?
don't bring griff into this.
you don't know anything about her.
- and whose fault is that?
- oh, it's my fault, einar. right?
isn't it my fault?
isn't everything my fault?
griffin flipped a coin.
what are you talking about?
griffin flipped a coin and i lost.
so i was the one driving.
it was three o'clock in the morning
and we were both tired.
we wanted to make it down to the rodeo in great falls.
it was a flipped coin?
what was it - a quarter?
was it a nickel?
- i don't remember what it was.
- i wanna know what killed my boy!
i killed him, einar.
is that what you wanna hear?
it wasn't the change in our pockets
or the weak-ass coffee or the rain.
it was me.
i fell asleep and i flipped the car six times.
i killed griffin.
you got no argument from me.
you think it's something i forget?
you think i'm not sick with it every day of my life?
but i tried to keep living and you haven't.
is that why you hate me so much?
you know, you act like i killed you the day griffin died.
well, great.
lie all the way down and we'll bury you.
what's the matter? you're afraid
no one will come to the funeral?
- we'll talk about your leaving tomorrow.
- we're done talking.
just so you know,
i have been trying.
but forgiving...
just isn't easy for me.
son of a bitch.
what the hell did he call it?
what - does he think he's a preacher
or some goddamn thing?
know-it-all.
i'm sorry we woke you up so early.
that's ok. i'm not
a great sleeper anyway.
hey, i got a regular mattress out in the storage shed.
maybe you and i can wrestle it in here after work.
did you drink the whole bottle?
she left. she walked out of here
and took the kid.
that her idea or yours?
i didn't drink the whole thing.
which side of your ass you want
the needle in this morning?
left.
well, what'd you dream about last night?
i didn't dream at all.
i lay awake all night, wondering if you'd
ever stop blaming the world for whatever.
wondering if you'd be able
to hold on to the family you've got.
i managed to hang on to you, didn't i?
have you ever wondered why i'm the only one left?
well, i have my boy.
i have his memories.
yeah.
maybe he'll remember how desperately
he wanted to get out of here.
how bad he wanted a life of his own.
if you weren't a cripple,
i'd jerk you out and kick your ass.
oh, talk sense.
i never saw the day you thought
you could kick my ass, einar.
- einar!
- what?
i wanna go see the bear.
you've seen the bear.
- i want you to take me to angie's.
- you're not up to it.
i'm not asking permission, goddammit!
i want a ride!
well, then call a taxi.
- i'm going back.
- what?
i'm staying with my grandpa
and mr. bradley.
- the hell you are, griff.
- yes, i am.
no, you're not!
you're not going anywhere.
you're staying right here.
i'm going back, ok?
you make decisions like they don't matter
for anybody else but you!
that is not true.
i always think about you first.
then it should start to show.
griff! get back here!
i'm not gonna say it again.
let her go.
let her go be with her grandfather for a while.
do you think i'm a shitty mother?
i think you're doing the best you can.
that's her second-grade picture.
of your daughter?
yeah.
we were having a picnic at the river
and she went for a swim.
she wanted to practice.
she was a great swimmer.
and i, uh...
i looked away for a minute.
and she was... gone.
she was...
i would do anything to have that minute back.
but i'm never gonna.
- nina, i'm...
- we're not supposed to outlive our children.
you have to understand that about einar.
- where's your mother?
- she's staying with nina.
you walked all the way out here by yourself?
i got hungry.
want one egg or two?
we got a lot to do today.
how about two?
what are we gonna do with that?
you spread it around so we don't have to walk in it.
here, slide on over here and take the wheel.
- come on.
- i can't drive.
you're not gonna be driving.
you're gonna be steering.
come on. you can do it.
turn before you get to that fence.
don't touch anything else.
yeah.
ok.
- set.
- yeah.
six o'clock in the morning, i wake up to gunfire.
and i look out the window
and everything's shot to hell in the yard.
- jonesy, it's pottery.
- still, man.
shouldn't you be catching people
who are shooting the neighborhood up?
why the hell didn't you tell me gary was in town?
excuse me.
- i didn't think you'd want to see him.
- well, i had a right to know.
i just... i would have thought
you'd had enough of him.
come on, crane. why don't you ask me
what you really wanna know?
why didn't i just walk away the first time he hit me?
why didn't i just call the police? right?
it's so simple.
- crane, are you gonna deal with this?
- just give me a second here.
jean.
i couldn't care less about his personal problems.
there's a buffalo over there.
his name is ronnie.
and then there's two wolves.
tom and jerry.
come on. look.
food.
come on.
aren't you hungry?
you had enough?
yeah.
yeah, i've had all i need.
no, no, no, that's ok.
i gotta run to the feed store for a minute.
you think you can fix mitch some lunch?
sure.
ok, then.
einar?
einar!
- mitch?
- griff.
- get einar for me.
- he went to town.
oh, no.
do you know where he keeps my medicine?
- in the refrigerator?
- go get it for me.
- right now?
- quick as you can.
ok.
- ok.
- ok. good girl.
do you... you know how to load it?
yeah, just... that's it.
ok.
pull the pants down,
stick it in me and push the plunger down.
was that ok?
it was so smooth, i thought my mom had done it.
thank you.
hey.
jean.
as it turns out, you're right.
i'm a complete asshole.
i never judged you for being with him, though.
you're wrong about that.
you made it stop.
you left him.
you wanna know the ugly little truth?
you stay because you don't think you deserve any better.
'cause you think it's the best you can do.
it's mr. bradley.
how you doing?
we can't just leave him there, einar.
we walked into his business.
hell, he was just doing what bears do.
we can't punish him for that.
you got to let him go, einar.
get him out of that cage.
don't you lie here and think i can do that.
you know, i can get myself shaved in the morning.
- all the way dressed too.
- ok.
could probably manage to stick myself
in the butt with one of those syringes.
but what i can't do is continue
to lie here every day and watch you mourn
for a life you think you should have had.
there are people everywhere
who think they got dealt a bad hand, einar.
hey.
did i give him too much?
no.
you did great today.
goddamn bear.
i don't know what i'm gonna do.
i never do anything right.
well, what do you think?
attagirl.
- right, let's try third. let the clutch out.
- third?
now, let's go to the left.
not too hard.
ok, that's good.
you're getting the hang of it.
there you go. i think we're
gonna get this thing done.
hey, griff.
how's life on the ranch?
it's good.
jean, you got two customers out here.
hey.
- we're just visiting, ok?
- ok.
i miss you.
what you been doing?
einar's been teaching me how to drive.
why don't you go look to see
what nina's got in the kitchen for special?
- ok?
- ok.
would you care if i took her camping?
thanks for bringing her in, einar.
- did she say driving?
- it's a ranch.
- she's 11.
- i know, i know. she...
but she's a good girl.
good kids don't get that way by accident.
- is that a compliment?
- it's just the way it is.
what else you been teaching her?
i don't know enough
to know what to teach a girl.
what i'm saying...
is if you wanna come back to the ranch, that's...
that's gonna be ok.
maybe tomorrow then, when you get back.
tomorrow would be fine.
i think camping would be great.
she'll love that.
- do you want all of these?
- yep, all of 'em. hold on to those.
what's the medicine for?
when we get that bear in the cage,
i'm gonna give him a shot.
that way, he can sleep all the way up to the mountain.
i'm sorry.
i didn't mean to scare you.
- jesus christ, gary.
- how are ya?
god, you look great.
i thought you left town.
well, i wanted to see you.
you know i miss you.
i don't want you here, gary.
can't you understand that?
must be nice for griff,
living up here with her grandfather.
country living and all.
of course, it's not for you.
just give it up, gary.
i'm not coming back to you.
can we just at least sit down?
have a drink or some kind of...
offer me a coffee or some...
it's pretty country up here.
might stick around a while.
we're gonna get caught.
these are government guys we're stealing this from.
they went home to dinner a long time ago.
i thought you said we're just borrowing it.
as long as i pay my taxes,
it's the same thing. let's go.
ok, now scoot on over and get ready to back up.
come on ahead. easy.
come on.
whoa.
ok.
here.
hold that still.
- when i tell you, you start cranking.
- ok.
- i'm a little bit scared.
- that makes two of us.
start cranking.
ok, now get in the truck.
ok.
come on.
einar!
- get behind me. get behind me.
- einar, i'm sorry.
get in the truck.
walk slowly and don't look right at him.
get in the truck!
go on.
look here.
- einar!
- wait a minute. oh, shit.
are you ok?
i think that he went through an artery.
i think you'd better get me to a hospital.
- oh!
- sorry.
hello?
what?
i was just trying to pull... oh!
pull the, uh, loft door down.
you know, to keep the bats out.
'cause once those bats get in the rafters,
then you can't hardly get 'em out.
and that's when he fell.
right. that's when i fell.
it was just dumb.
i didn't know what the hell i was doing.
- let's try this again, einar.
- hmm? oh, jesus, no...
i hit the gearshift.
- i didn't mean to.
- it wasn't your fault.
it was an accident.
you did everything just right tonight.
as well as your dad could have done.
i guess god kept me alive to bring her into the world.
but every day, i wish...
i wish it was me that died
in that car instead of griffin.
i wish you both had lived.
i was fallen-down drunk
the night that mitch got mauled.
that's why i couldn't get the bear off him before i did.
he never said anything about it.
he never would.
you.
i'm not just gonna lie down here.
just keep going.
heard you made a hell of a fall, einar.
you're lucky you only cracked two ribs.
it was the soft part of the yard.
- am i finished?
- not yet.
i'm going to keep you here for a little bit,
make sure your spleen's ok.
ah, i'm fine.
well, i'll check back on you this afternoon.
so you can double-bill me?
seems fair to me.
you are twice the trouble.
let's give it a day or two, ok?
hmm.
couple of days.
that's bullshit.
einar?
ok?
yeah, i'm fine. got clumsy.
mitch.
mitch, we set the bear free.
i know.
thank you.
you want me to run some breakfast out to mitch?
no. usually coffee's enough
for him in the morning.
you know,
she could go to school here.
not a bad school.
whoa, jimmy.
stay there.
- what do you want, gary?
- it's time to come home, baby.
i love you, jean.
you love me?
- that's what your love feels like.
- you bitch!
- mom!
- don't you ever hit me!
- mom!
- don't you hit me!
- mom, are you ok? mom! mom!
- come on.
- mom! mom!
- let her go, gary!
- let go of me.
- are you coming or staying?
hey! take your hands off her!
what the hell?
get in the car.
get in there!
griff, get out of the car.
- griff! griff, goddammit!
- griff!
mom!
mom!
come on.
mom.
- come on.
- mom.
- it's enough, einar.
- mom.
you leave her alone.
now, come on here. come on, get.
get out of here. get away,
you greedy little bugger.
- she didn't do anything to you.
- that's mitchell. he's a boy.
yep.
come on.
get outta... goddamn...
loma.
loma, nebraska.
so what about you, mitch?
you know anything about this?
about what?
so you don't know anything about it?
i just drove him home from the hospital.
mm-hm. of course. right.
hello, officer curtis.
good afternoon there, griff.
einar.
would you stay for lunch today?
yeah, i might.
i gotta speak to your grandfather
for a second, though, first.
ah, heck. it can wait.
here, let me grab that for you.
so, how was she today?
looks good, huh?
- yeah? did you do the milking?
- yeah.
think it might rain today.
no, it's gonna stay warm.
i didn't say anything about the
temperature. i said it might rain.
would you bury me next to griffin?
don't you think you oughta die first?
it's gonna happen, you know.
where the hell else do you think
i'd bury you? it's where my family lies.
you think the dead really care about our lives?
yeah, i think they do.
i think they forgive us our sins.
i even think it's easy for them.
griff said you had a dream about flying.
yeah.
i got so high, einar,
i could see where the blue turns to black.
from up there, you could see all there is.
and it looked like there was a reason for everything.
