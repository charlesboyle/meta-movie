<i>he is testing us.</i>
<i>our lord is testing us.</i>
<i>especially now...</i>
<i>...when we are consumed with despair.</i>
<i>when we are asking our god
why this had to happen.</i>
no parent should ever have to
know the horror
of burying their own child.
and yet...
...five of bomont's brightest
have lost their lives.
among them, my only son.
my boy. bobby.
we have other children
to raise here in bomont.
and one day, they will
no longer be in our...
...embrace and in our care.
they will belong to the world.
a world filled
with evil and temptation...
...and danger.
but until that day,
they are ours to protect.
that is the lesson to be taken
from this tragedy. that is our test.
we cannot be missing
from our children's lives.

your great grandma esther,
who you didn't know.
this is her secret recipe.
yeah, you know what
the secret ingredient is?
bourbon.
it's not bourbon. it's a ton of butter.
- that's code for bourbon.

i didn't know if you were a vegetarian,
or a vegan or something?

we ask you to bless this food,
nourishment of our body and
greater strength for thy good.

of the needs of others.

this used to be my office,
but lulu fixed her up for you.
it's got all the essentials...
water, power, bed.
look, i appreciate what you've
done here. taking me in and all.
there, at the end, the money
you sent us... it really helped.
i wish i could have done more.
now, look... there's rules in my house.
they're not written down,
they're just common sense.
do your schoolwork. don't stay out late,
that's not just my rule, that's the law.
and don't give people attitude.
this ain't boston.
i really want to
pull my own weight around here...
cooking meals, getting work,
helping out.
my buddy, andy beamis runs
a cotton gin up on chulahoma.
he said you can start
in the middle of next week.
couldn't i work at the car lot with you?
i'm good with engines, oil changes.
that's how i made money back home.
in this economy, that's the best i got.
i suggest you learn to love it.
come on.
how am i supposed to
get to work and school?
you got subways out here in mayberry?
there's that yankee sarcasm
i've been hearing about.
wish it were funnier. ok.
you say you're good with engines?
i'll make you a deal.
if you can get this baby running,
she's all yours.
- this?
- that's a bad-ass car, boy.
ok, ok. the door sticks.
and the gas pedal's missing.
a couple of the, uh...
hey, it's a fixer-upper.
he did it! he did it!
have a safe trip!
oh, shit!
step out of your vehicle, son.
- is there a problem, officer?
- driver's license.
massachusetts, huh?
you got that music cranked
pretty loud, mr. maccormack.
you gonna throw me in jail
for playing quiet riot?
let's watch that attitude, son.
- yankee sarcasm.
- what was that?
nothing. sir.
- you'll have to appear in court.
- for what?
disturbing the peace.
peaceful out here, isn't it?
<i>progress.
what does progress mean to you?</i>
<i>we have computers in our pockets,</i>
<i>telephones in our automobiles,
and money on a plastic card.</i>
who here today remembers a time
when you had to go
inside the bank to get your money?
remember old mr. rucker
down at bomont state bank?
every time you made a deposit, he'd
give you a piece of bazooka gum.
now, i haven't yet met an atm machine
that would give me a piece
of bazooka chewing gum,
let alone make me feel special,
like mr. rucker did.
now, is that progress?
today...
...more and more, as families,
we are tuning each other out.
we're either surfing on the internet,
texting on our cell phones, or
staring mindlessly at a television set.
now, if that is a portal to the world,
i want no part of it.
these are the people
that we need to tune in to.
everyone in this church.
- thanks for coming today.
- nice preaching today, reverend.
- good to see you.
- yes, sir, you, too.
this is my sister's son, the one
i was telling you about. ren maccormack.
- ren, ren, welcome to bomont.
- how you doing?
- we are so happy to have you with us.
- thank you.
i think you're gonna like
bomont high school.
in fact, if i'm not mistaken,
the graduating class this year
is the biggest in the school's history.
hey, roger! come on over here!
how many seniors
we have at bomont high this year?
- about 220, give or take a dropout.
- roger's the school principal there.
- hello.
- wait... do you play football?
- 'cause we really need a good kicker.
- ain't that a fact!
but, remember, if you're gonna play
for us, you gonna have to stay clean,
keep out of trouble. i heard you
already had a run-in with the law.
you what?
i don't know how it is up in boston,
but down here we have rules
against playing music too loud.
you're kidding me.
he got popped for playing music?
ariel! i want you to meet my daughter,
she goes to bomont.
you're going to need a friend
on your first day.
this is ren maccormack. he'll be
attending school with you tomorrow.
- hey.
- hey.

- yes, honey?
rusty and i have that
science project due tomorrow,
we're going to be working on it pretty
late. i was thinking i'd stay over.
- is that ok?
- on a school night? is that necessary?
rusty! don't you think
it's gonna take us all night?
sure. at least.
- i guess it's fine, right...
- thanks, daddy. bye, mom.
come on, let's go.
<i>and with two laps to go,
the leader is car number 44,</i>

get yourself killed out there!
<i>once again, ladies and gentlemen, your
late-model division two-time champion.</i>
<i>let's give it up for chuck cranston!</i>
<i>thanks for coming out to the
cranston motor speedway.</i>
<i>- rusty!
- we hope you had a good time.</i>
rusty, i'm talking to you!
you know when you're watching
the news, and you see someone
- get killed doing something stupid?
- god, this again?
i don't want to be that stupid friend
who just stands around watching.
- he should never let you do that!
- so you're just going to leave me?
me?
leave you?
i don't know what's going on
with you any more.
ever since bobby...
- i guess i'll get my own ride back.
- i guess you will.
yellow flag.
baby, why we got to go so fast?
you want some choirboy
to put a promise ring on your finger?
you're not gonna find that with me,
preacher's daughter.
stop. i get that from everybody else.
i don't need that from you.
i thought it was real simple
with you and me.
yeah?
i'm your man.
you're... you're my rebel child.
i'm not a child.
prove it.
shut the door.
go on.
are you going to pout all day?
look, i already said i was sorry.
it's monday. everybody gets a do-over.
- you love me!
- i know i do!
isn't that that new kid
my mom introduced me to at church?
sure is. he's cute.
- you think everybody's cute.
- i know, but i think he's cute.
he dressed up for his first day
of school. that's so cute!
oh, my god, rusty. come on, let's go.
did you see his tie?
i like it and i'm going to tell him.
- that's a nice tie.
- rusty.
hey, i mean it!
don't let anyone tell you different.
thanks, uh...
- rusty.
- it's ahriel, right?
it's ariel.
- ariel.
- very good.
hey. watch where
you're going, little guy.
- sorry, man. i didn't see you.
- it's like driving.
stick with the
flow of traffic, numbnuts.
maybe if you weren't wearing
all that camouflage, i could see you.
you should get one of them orange
vests so hunters don't shoot you.
an orange vest? i don't wear orange.
i'm not a tennessee fan.
i'm a georgia bulldog.
where you from? you talk funny.
i talk funny? i talk funny?
you should hear you from my end.
i'm from boston.
massachusetts?
- it's in the united states?
- yeah, i read that somewhere.
what's up, man? i'm willard.
- i'm ren. maccormack.
- nice to meet you. let me see this.
literature and composition.
that's this way. follow me.
people give you shit
about that tie yet?
- nah, but the dayjust started.
- first group, on your mark...
keep that head down! head down!
i'm gonna smoke your butt, man.
- you think so?
- i know so. your butt's getting smoked.
come on, willard!
go get your water.
don't gulp it down!
warm it up in your mouth.
two swallows, hit them monkey bars.
- you're looking flushed, willard.
- my cheeks are naturally ruddy, man.
ren, this is woody, our team captain.
you don't gotta salute him.
- what's up, man? nice to meet you.
- how's it going?
last year, varsity made it to regional.
they bussed us down to alabama.
the excitement never stops.
- you haven't been overseas?
- i've been to alabama, if that counts.
no. it doesn't.
i went to russia two years ago
with my gymnastics team.
it's kind of a sister city
thing with moscow.
yeah, russia... i don't know if i
dig that. it sounds kind of boring.
do you know anything
about russian girls?
i know they range from
bearded to drop-dead beautiful.
yeah? well, i can vouch
for the beautiful ones.
two girls from the russian team
snuck me out of my dorm room
late night. they didn't have beards.
- they were smoking.
- what were they smoking?
oh, you mean, like, smokin' hot.
i'm sorry. continue.
so we go to this club.
the music's banging. it's pitch black.
i couldn't see shit, just hot two girls
drenched in sweat all over me.
- we danced all night.
- great. what'd you guys do after?
oh, come on. look, down in the south,
you can't start a story
about a threesome and not finish it.
come on.
it goes without saying,
these girls are flexible.
they take me into a bathroom stall.
one shoves her tongue down my throat,
the other one's on top. this girl's
a champion pommel horse gymnast.
i'm talking killer
upper body strength. banging.
she's scratching my back,
she's tearing my clothes off.
<i>and her friend's whispering
in my ear, "hernnya".</i>
<i>- her...
- hernnya.</i>
<i>- hernnya.
- yeah.</i>
- what does that mean?
- it's russian for "bullshit".
why would she say that?
- 'cause you're bullshitting me?
- yup. yeah.
but we did dance, man.
we danced our asses off.
that ain't right.
you ever work at a gin before?
you know about a bale press?
i don't know. i've never seen one.
- where are you from?
- boston, mass.
did they teach you
anything useful up north?
just enough to get by. i'm hoping y'all
can teach me the three r's.
three r's?
yeah, you know...
reading, writing, redneckery.
people are giving you
a hard time, i can see that.
you're young, you're from out of town
and you're a smart aleck.
can you start thursday?
yeah. yes, sir!
i'll teach you to read and write,
but you're on your own
when it comes to redneckery.
yeah. give it a little bit of gas.
yeah, that sounds good. cut it.
what's the deal with the preacher's
daughter? she worth all that attitude?
i hear, back in the day,
she used to be a goody two-shoes.
now she fronts like she some hellraiser.
wearing her jeans tight and everything.
you could put a quarter
in that girl's back pocket
and tell if it's heads or tails.
why? you're trying to knock boots
with her, aren't you?
- no.
- yes, you are. he is.
i'm just curious. i ain't trying to
bang her or take her ballroom dancing.
well, that'd be pretty hard,
being that that's against the law.
what? banging a preacher's daughter?
no, public dancing's against the law
if you're under 18.
shut up.
wait, wait, wait. jump back.
are you kidding me?
dancing is against the law?
yeah, man. we got laws
up the poop chute around here.
i can't even bring a bandana to school,
because they think i'm in a gang.
if my face gets sweaty,
i gotta use the back of my hand.
let me tell you something,
this country was built on bandanas.
so you're telling me bomont high
doesn't have a prom.
well, you know...
they got the fall ball, right?
ok. so, all the churches
get together and put it on.
the whole town shows up
and everybody's eyes are on you
to make sure you're dancing
at least six inches away from your girl.
you gotta add
another two inches for me.
and, for one song, they make you...
they make you dance with your mother.
i mean, talk about a boner killer.
and the schools don't wanna
have dances on their property.
they... they say they
don't want to be held liable.
they don't want to be held
liable for what?
five seniors died in a car crash
coming home from a dance,
and that's when
the whole town went crazy.
they started blaming it on the liquor,
the music, the dancing.
after a while everybody
started thinking dancing was a sin.
but we're talking about the law, right?
not heaven and hell?
yeah, take that up with reverend moore.
i'm a machine, i'm a machine.
hey, what's up, dude?
hey, woody, what's up, man?
hey, how you doing?
- maccormack.
- how you doing, buddy?
- good, man. you hungry?
- yeah. what's good here?
we got nachos, hot dogs, hamburgers.
frito pie, all the way.
and if you're a real man?
you'll eat that jalapeño.
- get your fingers out of my pie!
- what about that guy?
you don't know where his finger's been.
woody! check the door, man.
cop still here?
five-o getting his move on.
- what you got for me, uncle claude?
- david banner.
bootleg. don't get too krunk out there.
first sign of the police,
i'm gonna pull the plug.
i don't wanna get a fine,
and you don't wanna get another ticket.
- wait. you got a ticket for dancing?
- he got two tickets for dancing.
one more and he's off the team.
all right. let's get
this party started! it's on!
- no cops. let's get it, come on!
- let's get it started!
yo! it's showtime!
- it's clear!
- let's go!
back it up, back it up, move out.
whoa.
- woody!
- woody!
whoa!
now that's what i'm talkin' about.
that's a beautiful thing!
does that turn you on?
girls acting like hussies?
it don't suck.
oh, now, come on.
yeah, dude. they... they get into it.
hey, you. let's go.
come on, let's dance.
- come on!
- i'm good. i don't dance.
you go have fun.
me and my boys are going
to push everybody back.
let me see you do that city boy thing.
c'mon! get it!
oh, dang. oh, dang.
claude! reverend moore's
out front, man.
oh, shit.
you want me to step in on this?
what, you can't keep up?
you can put on a show for that guy.
doesn't mean i'm gonna.
<i>attention, attention. ariel moore,</i>
<i>will you please come up
to the front of the diner.</i>
<i>your daddy is here for you.</i>
she's busted!
show's over.
you mother was afraid you didn't
have any money. she said you'd be here.
daddy, it's not a big deal.
we were just messing around.
i think it would be best
if you came home with me.
right now.
daddy gonna
take her out to the woodshed.
what the hell does that mean?
it means she's in deep shit.
- hey, honey. you're home early.
- yeah.
did you have fun?
- just breaking the law, momma.
- ariel. we have not finished talking.
ariel!
why do you think you're above serving
your penalty in saturday school?
i don't think i'm above anyone, sir.
i was just unaware that...
hey, eddie? eddie?
he has a job on saturdays
over at andy's cotton gin.
wes. call me "judge", would you?
- and take your hat off.
- ok, judge eddie.
could you show a little mercy here?
he was playing his music too loud.
about as loud as you used to
play lynyrd skynyrd
in that old impala
me and you used to roll in.
remember that... judge?
you'll have andy verify his employment?
- now hold on...
- yes i will!
- can i go back to the car lot now?
- sentence suspended.
oh, man. son, you're lucky.
not everyone's got this town
on lockdown like i do.
oh, yeah? since you and the judge
are so buddy-buddy,
maybe you can have him explain this
whole ban-on-dance thing to me.
whatever happened to separation
of church and state?
what's church got to do with it?
it seems to have everything
to do with everything around here.
let me ask you a question.
if there's a football game sunday
and you want to buy a beer, can you?
- you can't buy beer on sundays.
- and why not?
'cause of church.
you can in boston, why not in bomont?
look. sunday is god's day.
if you want to drink beer on god's day,
you need to buy it on beer's day,
which is saturday.
it's right there in the bible,
if you don't believe me.
separation of god and beer.
and if god said it, i believe it.
that settles it! now shut up.
hey, maccormack.
hey, what's up... ariel?
chuck cranston wants to see you
at his daddy's racetrack tomorrow.
- be there at two o'clock.
- ok. what happens at two o'clock?
- show up and find out.
- and what if i don't?
- you're gonna miss all the fun.
- how come he sent you to tell me?
i volunteered.
if that shithog tries anything,
i'm gonna pound him.
- no fighting, willard.
- no promises, rusty.
you guys, keep the smoke away
from her now. her daddy smells that,
- he'll never let her hang out again.
- high school field trip's here.
twinkle toes.
watching you the other night,
that was real entertaining.
we thought we'd invite you out here.
maybe you could put on a show for us.
chuck, didn't you hear?
he's real into gymnastics.
gymnastics.
well... i thought only fags
were into gymnastics.
i thought only assholes
still used the word "fag".
touché.
why don't you...
...try dancing with this?
now... we race these buses
every weekend at the derby mash-up.
we race them in a figure eight,
just like this.
two things you gotta worry about.
your corners, and your intersection.
you fall behind, you're gonna
get hit by the leader.
you pull ahead, you just might
get slammed by the guy in last place.
what do you say, city boy?
ready to race?
i drove one of these at a pep rally
one time... it ain't easy.
all right? if she flips over,
crawl out the side window.
if it catches on fire, jump out of it.
- keep loose.
- pump your brakes with your foot.
pump the brakes. tell him.
- i just told him.
- cool. pump them brakes.
- all right, man. good luck.
- whoa, whoa! guys, guys.
this is pretty dangerous, right?
we could get killed?
we? what's this "we", white boy? crazy.
we? like i'd get my black ass up there.
what'd i get myself into?
how do, all you pissants? welcome
to the cranston motor speedway!
whoa, baby! you ok?
you kinda had a lot to smoke.
don't be tellin' me
when i've had enough.
looks like a lovely day for a bus...
i didn't say you had enough.
i just said you had a lot.
if you want to lecture somebody,
go tell sweet buns to start his engine.
we got one practise lap
before the green flag drops, folks.
it's a three-lap race to the
finish line, or the last man standing.
gentlemen, start your engines!
let's go!
we've got home-grown hero
chuck cranston in burn in hell.

door, they're battling for third place!
you want a little smooch?
she is tearing him up!
coming out of turn four.

headed straight for the intersection!

somebody better do something!
- watch out, baby!

- sorry, girl.
russell! you damn son of a bitch!
russell and maccormack
are duking it out for second place.
shit!
we got fireworks! god bless america!
and i'm on fire.
chuck cranston holds the lead
with one lap to go!
getting lonely up here!
oh, we've got us a regular
mexican standoff, folks.
don't you play chicken with me, boy.
who's gonna back down?
who's gonna back down?
somebody's got to back down.
- oh, what the hell.
- no, no, no! damn it!
chuck is down!
maccormack takes the lead!
yeah!

- abandon bus!
abandon bus!
we need to get off this bus!
ren, you gotta get off, man!
yes, sir! get some! fire it up!
- you ok, baby?
- oh, my god!
get some!
that was awesome!
let's do that again! yes!
hey, man. chuck's pretty sore
about losing that race.
i mean, you blew up
the man's bus, dude.
yeah... bomont blows, dude.
i don't have to tell you, though, do i?
yeah. i've been to chicago. st. louis.
been up to some of them clubs
in new york city. i been around.
- just like you, man.
- oh, yeah?
yeah.
hey.
you get high?
'cause i do... every damn day.
if you want, you and i
can go burn one right after school.
you know, city mouse, country mouse...
blazing!
what makes you think
i'm anything like you?
hold on a second.
this is what we call a take-homer.
you need anything else?
- i don't want this.
- it's cool. it's cool.
no, it's not cool. take this...
we can go down to the
railroad tracks and chief one now.
- no, seriously, take this.
- hey!
- what is that?
- what's what?
in your hand. let me see it.
young man. hey!
hey! stop! hey! stop, stop!
hey! stop!
open the door!
open!
i will not tolerate it, ren.
not in my school.
so what have you gotta say for yourself?
what do i have to say? i was on
the gymnastics team for three years.
got drug tested all the time.
if i smoked weed, i'd be off the team.
- he had a joint...
- you know what one looks like?
were you going to smoke it or sell it?
mr. parker says you were with
rich sawyer when this went down.
- i don't even know that prick.
- hey! language.
ren, level with me.
was it rich's joint? you can tell me.
i don't do drugs.
you can test me.
and when it comes out clean,
i want this guy investigated for
barging into the bathroom stall with me.
that's gross.
well. since we don't have the evidence,
i'm going to let you off
with a warning this time.
but ren, listen to me,
you have to understand something.
you see, life is not some big party.
i don't care what the rap music
people say, marijuana is just wrong.
son, listen to me.
ren, i knew your momma.
that's right. i knew sandy.
she had a wild spark, just like you.
running off up north, trying to live
the high life might have been fun,
but it also led her into getting
into some kind of...
- ... unexpected trouble.
- unexpected trouble.
i'm thinking when you say "unexpected
trouble", you're talking about me.
right? right?
look, believe me, don't believe me.
suspend me, arrest me. i don't care.
but you do me one favour, all right?
never talk to me about my mother again.
you understand?
hey!
let him go.
hey, maccormack.
what's the rush?
dude, you trying to
ignore me or something?
i'm doing the best that i can!
<i>massachusetts, huh?</i>
you got that music's cranked
pretty loud, mr. maccormack.
"you got that music
cranked pretty loud, mr. maccormack. "
yeah! no shit, barney fife!
watch that attitude, son.
try being a cop in boston,
you huckleberry!
- i will not tolerate it, ren.
- shut up! i'm talking!
not in my school.
mr. dunbar.
mr. douchebag! mr. dumb-ass.
with your righteousness
and your little vest.
stop trying to act like you know me!
don't act like you know me. don't try
and act like you know my mother!
you don't know the pain
she went through every day.
you don't know shit!
you don't know shit!
- what are you doing here?
- what are you doing here?
- well, i thought i was alone.
- not in this town, you're not.
there are eyes everywhere.
- so what was all that?
- what was all what?
all that.
i was just letting off some steam,
i'm sure you got your own wicked ways.
you think i'm a slut or something?
i think you've been kissed a lot.
- where's lugnut?
- you mean chuck?
he doesn't own me. i know
he acts like he does, but he doesn't.
you want to see something?
everybody calls it the yearbook.
i don't know when it started,
maybe 10 years ago or so.
- what is all this?
- some are songs. lyrics.
quotes from books.
poems. music we're not
supposed to listen to.
- what do people do? just hang out?
- yeah.
and other stuff.
you think i'm small town, huh?
i think bomont is a small town.
you think?
try living here your whole life.
but that's all gonna change.
i've applied to colleges.
hell, i've applied to colleges
my daddy don't even know about.
nobody wants to see bomont
in their rear-view more than me.
you want to kiss me?
someday.
what's this "someday" shit?
you want to drop down
and tumble right here? ok.
you know that sweat's gonna dry
and you're still gonna feel like shit.
that's for chuck.
not me.
did you hear that?
come on, hurry!
where are you going?
sometimes, after football games...
...we all come out here
and when the train passes,
we just make out like crazy.
or...
...we just play chicken.
so, you're just going to let
the train hit you?
maybe.
all right, stop fooling around.
ok, get off the track.
ariel! get off the track!
how can i impose a curfew on
the young people of my congregation
if i can't enforce it in my own home?
have you been drinking?
i haven't been smoking,
drinking, dancing,
reading books i'm not supposed to.
i'm just late.
who brought you home just now?
ren maccormack.
i don't want you to see that boy again.
- why?
- because i've heard he's trouble.
trouble? well, man born of woman
is of few days and full of trouble.
job 14:1. you know, from the bible?
your behaviour
has been atrocious, young lady,
and it seems to have started
when ren maccormack came to town.
trust me, daddy.
ren's the least of your worries.
let's get some city life in you.
good night! this place is gigantic!
yeah. it's bigger than bomont.
hey. i'm gonna get something to drink.
you go out there and shake it.
- let go!
- i wanna shake it with you.
- dance with me.
- nah, i'm good. i'll watch you guys.
- you do this to me every time.
- i'm fine. i'm gonna drink.
go out there and dance. have fun.
- hey. just go dance with her.
- willard!
what's the matter with you, huh?
we drove two hours to get here. you're
just gonna stand around and mope?
i don't dance. all right? i don't dance.
i can't dance.
at all.
but it's country line dancing.
it's a white man's wet dream.
come on.
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
- excuse me, miss?
- y'all need to learn some new moves?
shit-howdy! you drop me at day care
while you go dance with them girls!
just learn a box step or two
and meet us out there.
- i got faith in you.
- yeah.
- just fall on in.
- all right.
maybe i should get my drink on first.
you got girls walking around
with jäger shots between their boobies?
no sir, we don't have that here.
well, you should.
one, two, three. good, guys.
- one, two, three...
- stupid.
- come on, willard! it's fun!
- i don't drink and dance.
so you're gonna stand around
like a dork the whole night?
i'd rather be a dork
than a dancing dork. yeah.
whoa.
hey, i got hat hair. come on.
hey!
she likes to dance.
yeah!
hey, shitkicker,
that's my girl you're groping!
willard, we're just dancing.
why are you dancing with another man
when you're wearing my hat?
ok, that is disrespectful.
look, nelly, why don't you go babysit
this girl's purse and fetch me a beer.
got a better idea. why don't i kick your
teeth in and grin while i'm doing it?
willard, no fighting.
you don't even know this guy.
i'll tell you what.
if he can count this high,
i'll give you to the count of three
to get out of my face, man! one!
willard!
come on, darlin'. party with
a real man and ditch this hayseed.
animal!
- it just happened so fast...
- you got knocked out.
i just remember politely asking him,
"hey, get off of my girl. "
this bridge gives me the creeps.
- willard!
- sorry.
- what?
- this is crosby bridge.
you know that photo in school?
the one with the teenagers
that all got killed.
this is where it happened.
my brother was driving them home.
they lost control
and they went head on into a truck.
they were seniors. two of them were
all-state, ronnie jamison and...
and my brother. bobby.
you would've liked him.
i looked up to him.
he was my hero.
but now every time i think about him,
i just think about this bridge.
four doors, you got a mazda,
a nissan, a cadillac.
low mileage, really good shape.
excuse me for one moment.
hey, reverend!
good afternoon.
hey, you need
your oil changed on that crown vic?
no, wes. i'm not here about my car.
i'm here about my daughter.
ok.
charlie, i need you to show
katelin the cadillac, buddy.
- all right.
- all right?
- right this way.
- you want to sit down?
wes, i know your nephew is new in town.
now i understand that
everybody needs a friend,
but i am not comfortable
with ren pursuing ariel.
pursuing?
yeah. you have two
little girls of your own,
and i think you should understand
where i'm coming from here, wes.
- i mean, as a father.
- no, i don't believe that i do.
why don't you tell me what
ren did exactly?
well, i hear he's been
having trouble at school.
trouble with drugs.
drugs.
where'd you hear that?
from roger? that guy's a bully.
and i'm not just saying that 'cause
he wants me to take down my sign.
it doesn't matter where i heard it, wes.
i don't want that kind of
influence around my daughter.
influence, huh?
reverend, have you ever
seen anybody die from leukaemia?
it's slow and ugly,
and that boy had to watch his momma
go all the way through it. alone.
his daddy was a deadbeat.
never lifted a finger to help.
when she got sick, he bolted.
it was ren who took care of her.
now, you may think that ren
isn't good enough for your daughter,
but, reverend, i could argue
it's the other way around.
well...
i just wanted to make myself clear.
see you in church.
i don't believe this town.
i bring ariel home past her curfew,
and reverend moore is all up in
my uncle's grill, making threats.
yeah. well, you know what it is?
you got an attitude problem.
- i got an attitude problem?
- yeah, you got an attitude problem.
every chance you get,
you're bad-mouthing this town.
we're small-time, but we got satellites
and cell phones like everyone else.
- we're making some progress.
- don't talk to me about progress.
i've been here two months and
haven't seen one wet t-shirt contest.
oh, i know. i don't know
what's up with that.
- that's not me.
- probably some stupid law against it.
i tell you what. you get
a petition for that, i'd sign it.
because if we can't have braless,
wet women here in bomont,
- the terrorists win.
- that's not a bad idea.
we could start our own petition.
challenge the law
against public dancing.
why not? then we can just
organise our own dance.
i'm not talking about some
drunken kegger or free-for-all orgy.
that right there? that's an idea!
i'm talking about a formal,
respectable dance.
one that's not held in the church,
with everyone's eyes on you.
you could have it in the bomont lockup.
'cause what you're talking about
is against the law.
let me tell you something about the law.
it's meant to be challenged.
- nothing's set in stone.
- ten commandments were.
- what's your smart-aleck reply to that?
- my smart-aleck reply?
hey! c'mon, man! hey!
stop! you want that wet t-shirt contest,
come and get it!
the price of a dog license
will go from 10 dollars to 15 dollars.
a licensed pet is a happy one.
all right. well, theyjust finished.
if you was gonna make your move,
this is when you do it.
it is at this time we will take
any new business or concerns.
come down to the podium,
state your name and address. anyone?
this meeting is adjourned!
so anyway, elinor was saying
we hadn't had you and vi over
for sunday brunch in quite a while.
- if you wanna get together...
- that'd be great.
reverend moore!
it's ren maccormack. wesley's nephew?
yes, ren. i know who you are.
yeah, well i figured you did.
wes told me you two had a talk.
there was a conversation
between your uncle and myself,
but it wasn't meant for your ears.
there's a lot of that going on
in this town. it's like that saying.
- the one about children? how's it go?
- that they're better seen than heard?
yeah. well, i just wanted to
let you know i'm starting a petition
to challenge the ordinance
prohibiting public dancing.
i just wanted to make sure
my intentions were clear.
well... good day, ren.
- showdown with the preacher man!
- you got balls the size of coconuts.
listen to me, you corn-fed hick.
if i got to stand up in front of
the city council and make my case,
y'all gonna learn how to dance.
you're not gonna tell anyone about this?
no, i'm not gonna tell.
- i'm serious.
- i promise. just follow the girls.
they know what they're doing,
and you don't.
- woody, anyone on the football team?
- nobody will know.
everybody will know.
...three, four.
one, two, three, four.
come on, man, you got to commit.
- come on, commit to the move.
- don't mess around. focus.
- just do it.
- shake it.
there you go, there you go.
- feel it.
- show me what you got.
good, good. more hips.
- less hips. less hips.
- a little less.
and we're jumping. and we're jumping.
yeah!
he's getting it a little bit.
jump, jump.
c'mon, just bounce, willard.
get gangsta with it. just bounce.
gangsters don't dance, we bounce.
come on, willard, get gangsta.
hey, hey, hey. hey, hey, hey.
hey! what's up, man?
you want some?! come get some!
hey, we were just dancing, man.
- can i help you with something?
- you guys got city records down here?
like local ordinances?
anything like that?
what do you want with those?
i wanna read them. isn't that what you
do in libraries other than get stoned?
let's move that ball
down the field! now!
two! forty-two!
willard!
what the hell are you doing, boy?
give me two laps right now.
you move it! now!
yeah! c'mon!
go, willard! go, willard!
go, willard! go willard!
nice.
hey. was that a three-pointer or a two?
that was a no-pointer.
getting names
on this petition is one thing,
but trying to write this speech...
i'm just having a hard time with it.
i saw you enlisted my daughters
in your campaign.
- i'm sorry about that.
- no. no need to apologise.
i think this family could use
a little activism.
what about uncky wes?
he seems a little worried.
well...
wesley, he is a car salesman trying to
sell cars in the middle of a recession.
so he's all about worry.
why is this dance so important?
when my dad left...
i wasn't really surprised. you know?
i never really felt like
i could depend on the guy anyways.
it was just me and mom, you know?
she was the strong one.
and then she got sick,
and it was my turn to be strong.
i thought if i worked really hard,
and listened to the doctors
and did everything they told me to do,
maybe we could turn it around.
maybe she'd get better.
but she didn't.
all that hard work,
i couldn't change anything.
but with this...
i'm thinking i could do something.
i could do something
for myself this time,
and maybe have a shot
at making a change.
you know?
that's all i want... is a shot.
otherwise, i'm just going to disappear,
like everyone else.
can i see that petition, please?
you got my vote, ren maccormack.
your momma would be proud.
aren't you gonna say anything?
well, you ain't telling me anything
i don't already know.
i got eyes and ears. yeah.
well, i thought
i should tell you myself.
yeah.
first you're into racecar drivers,
now you're into dancing gymnasts?
you crack me up.
you know, i seen the way
you've been looking at him.
just waiting for the
right moment to dumb down,
and wrap those skinny little
legs around him.
i'm so sick of you
treating me like dirt!
hey.
is that what i've been doing?
just treating you like another pit-row
hussy, we screw on the weekends?
i thought that's what you
came here to be.
you know what?
being a preacher's daughter don't give
you a free pass on acting like a slut.
ariel...
you walk your ass back home to daddy!
i treated you decent!
better than you deserve!
i don't need this shit.
i was about done with you anyway!
you son of a bitch!
stop! stop! what are...
crazy bitch!
don't touch me!
vi's in there with her.
you're ok, baby.
just don't worry, my angel.
that son of a bitch.
careful, daddy, you're in church.
look at me. look at me.
look at me.
did ren maccormack do this to you?
- answer me!
- let's keep calm.
- we don't even know what happened.
- our daughter has been assaulted, vi.
i'm calling the police.
i want him in handcuffs.
i can see how that works for you,
just blame everything on ren.
just like you blamed
everything on bobby.
what?
bobby spent his whole life
trying to make you proud.
he made good grades.
he went to church every sunday,
and god help him
because he made one mistake?
now nobody remembers
the good things about bobby,
all they remember is that damn accident!
why don't we have a school dance?
it's because of bobby!
why do we have this stupid curfew?
because of bobby!
bobby's to blame for all this bullshit!
lower your voice, talk in a civil tone.
- let's not do this here.
- why? isn't this my church? isn't it?!
isn't this where we're supposed to
talk about our problems?
it's been three damn years,
so why don't we start talking?!
i have been so lost.
i've been losing my mind.
and you don't even see it!
you don't even care.
of course i care.
of course we care.
we don't expect you
to understand everything we do
that's intended to keep you safe.
stop it! i hate it when you
treat me like i'm a child.
well, whether you like it or not,
you are my child!
i'm not even a virgin!
please...
please don't talk like that in here.
what are you going to do?
pass another law?
'cause that sure as hell
didn't keep him out of my panties!
shaw!
well, let's go get that guy
that blackened my eye,
'cause we don't hit girls in bomont,
do we daddy?
ariel, please.
- please, i didn't mean to!
- no, you stay here.
you've done enough.
- where is she?
- she's staying at rusty's.
i don't know what came over me.
i've never hit anybody in my life...
that's where you two are alike.
you deal with your pain in extremes.
i understand what you were trying to do.
you were trying to hold this town
together and protect our children.
but these laws, they were
too much, too soon.
there were other kids
who lost their lives.
- i felt like i had an obligation to...
- your obligation was to our daughter.
i have been a minister's wife
for 21 years now.
i have been supportive.
i've been silent.
i still think you are
a wonderful preacher.
but it is the one-on-one
where you could use a little work.
your old man's wrong about a lot, but
tossing chuck in jail sounds good to me.
i just want this whole thing behind me.
i got you something.
a bible?
it's not just any bible. it's mine.
i've had it since i was seven.
i marked a few pages. thought it might
help going up against the city council.
this is great.
really.
you said that
you might kiss me someday.
i did.
you think that someday could be today?
hey. what's your secret plan?
get up there and boogie?
yeah, i wish it were that easy.
this meeting will now come to order.
but, before we begin,
i would like to remind all you kids that
we are conducting an official meeting.
official town business. that means
no disturbances will be tolerated.
the floor is now open.
my name is ren maccormack.
and i want to move, on behalf of most
of the senior class of bomont high,
that the law against public dancing
within the town limits of bomont
- be abolished.
- yeah!
you will not be warned again.
roger, if i may address
mr. maccormack on this matter.
please do.
ren, besides the liquor, and the drugs
and the lewd behaviour that
seems to always accompany
these types of unsupervised events,
the thing that really
distresses me the most,
more than any of that,
is the spiritual corruption.
these dances, this music,
it does distort
young people's attitudes.
you might find it funny,
but i firmly believe that
dancing can be destructive.
and celebrating certain types of music
can be destructive.
and i think you're going to find that
most of the people in this community
are going to agree with me.
i believe a vote
is in order on this motion.
- all those opposed, please...
- excuse me.
i still got something to say
on this issue...
- i thought ren had the floor here.
- this meeting will come to order.
- that's not right!
- mr. maccormack.
i have been more than patient
with your intrusions.
i would like to remind you that we speak
for this town because we are from here.
excuse me, mr. dunbar.
for you to come into this council
chamber and question our motives...
roger! stop it!
i think mr. maccormack
has a right to be heard.
i wasn't here three years ago,
when tragedy struck this town.
and i know it's not my place to mourn
the lives that were lost
because i didn't know them.
but it doesn't mean that
i don't think about them every day.
like a lot of students at bomont,
i see those pictures
every day at school.
and each time i see their faces,
i think of how precious life is
and how quickly it can be taken from us.
i know this firsthand...
in my own way.
and three years ago,
nearly a dozen laws were introduced
to this council in order to
protect the children of bomont.
and most of these laws, i can see, as
a parent, how they make sense to you.
but my right to dance...
...when i want, where i want,
and how i want is a right
that you cannot take away.
it is mine.
see, we don't have that much time left.
all us teenagers, pretty soon
we're gonna be just like you.
we're gonna have jobs
and bills and families.
and we're gonna have to worry
about our own children
because that is the job of a parent.
to worry. i get that.
but ours, as teenagers, is to live.
to play our music way too loud
and to act like idiots.
and to make mistakes.
aren't we told in psalm 149...
..."praise the lord.
sing unto the lord a new song.
and let them praise
his name in the dance. "
now if anybody else brought
their bible, like i did,
will you please turn it to the
book of samuel, 6:14.
"david... david danced before the lord
with all his might, leaping
and dancing before the lord. "
celebrating his love of god
and celebrating his love of life.
with what? with dancing!
that's all we're doing here.
ecclesiastes assures us, "there is a
time for each purpose under heaven.
there's a time to weep.
there's a time to mourn.
and there is a time to dance. "
and this is our time.
there was once a time for that law,
but not any more.
thank you.
thanks, chris.
you know you was railroaded.
shaw moore walked into that meeting
with those votes already in his pocket.
you didn't have a prayer.
- so what happens now?
- nothing. it's over.
what if it's not?
what if you had your dance in bayson?
the point was to have it in bomont.
what's bayson, like 30 miles away?
no. you're standing in it. come here.
you see that water tower? that's in
bomont. everything east is in bayson.
that means the cotton gin.
now, i figure that if the
bomont fire trucks can't come
this far east, neither can
the long arm of the law.
what about the long arm
of reverend moore?
well, try to convince him
it won't be a spiritual corruption.
maybe he'll think about it.
and the disciples
came to jesus and said,
"master, why is it that
we can't do such things?"
and jesus said,
"it's because you have little faith.
if you even had the faith
of a tiny mustard seed,
you can say to the tallest mountain,
'move from here to there'
and it will move.
for with faith, anything... "
who's there?
it's me. it's ren maccormack.
ren.
i thought you were someone else.
my son used to sit there
when i would practise my sermons,
- and i...
- yeah, with me it's grocery stores.
excuse me?
there's always so many mothers
at grocery stores.
you get enough of them calling
after their kids and pretty soon,
you know, one of them starts
to sound like your own mom.
sometimes i think i can really hear her.
sit down.
my boy, bobby, was taken from us
so suddenly, and...
i can't remember
the last thing i said to him.
well, it ain't so easy
with time, either.
with my mother, i always thought
there'd be this day where we got to
say our good-byes.
but, you know, death...
...death is on its own clock.
yes... it is.
look, i know you and the council
voted against us having this dance,
but it's not gonna
stop it from happening.
andy beamis gave us
permission to use his place.
and with your permission...
...sir.
i would like to take ariel to the dance.
now i promise you,
i would never, ever do anything
to hurt her or disrespect her.
and i sure as hell
won't let anybody else.
i didn't mean to swear
in your church. i'm sorry.
wouldn't be the first time.
the dance means a lot to me.
i mean, you know that.
but your daughter... she means more.
and if you don't let her go,
i'm not gonna go.
i know you got to do what you got to do.
well, thank you for...
thank you.
i'm standing before you today
with a troubled heart.
i've insisted on taking
responsibility for your lives.
but i'm really...
...just like a first-time parent
who makes mistakes,
and learns as he goes along.
and, like that parent,
i find myself at that moment
when i have to decide...
...do i hold on
or do i trust you to yourselves?
do i let go and hope that
you've understood my lessons?
if we don't start
trusting our children...
...how will they
ever become trustworthy?
i'm told that the senior class
at bomont high school
has secured the use of a warehouse
in nearby bayson for a senior dance.
please join me
in keeping them in our prayers...
...that our lord will guide them
in their endeavours.
now, if you will turn to your hymnals...
- ... page 472.
- see? who said there's no miracles?
"just as i am thine own to be. "
- willard, look in there.
- what is this?
- grab hold.
- grab hold. all right, let's lift!
c'mon, c'mon...
you look stunning!
really? is it ok, though?
i mean, it's not too simple, right?
oh, baby, simple elegance
is something to strive for.
well, you can't go to a prom
without a corsage.
oh, my gosh. mom! it's beautiful.
- you didn't have to do that.
- i didn't.
no red boots?
not tonight.
- can you help me pin this?
- sure.
it's not that kind of corsage.
it goes on your wrist.
you have no idea how hard it is for me
to let you walk out that door.
i just want what every parent wants.
i want my kids to come home safe.
i know it's been hard on you.
and i know i haven't made it any easier.
i just don't want you to be
disappointed in me any more.
no. you are my angel.
and i will always love you.
hey, daddy, guess what?
we're dancing.
i was going to come up and...
what? what's the matter?
you look beautiful.
- yeah?
- yeah.
come here.
shaw, come over here. you've got
to see them. they look wonderful!
- they're gonna think that we're spying.
- we are spying. come here!
let me get the door for you.
ren, it's ok.
i can go through your door.
hold on, i gotta kick it
from the other side.
ren, stop.
come here.
- won't you give me a hand?
- yes.
- you ok?
- i'm good.
ok.
that was smooth.
good job, ariel.
hey. c'mon.
hey, woody. by the looks of it, i'd say
our offensive line has no backbone.
you should move your team
down the field, captain. come on.
come on.
huddle up. come on.
y'all see them women over there?
they ain't looking for
a first down, or a touchdown.
they're looking for some men to
take charge and ask them to dance.
y'all gonna ride the bench
or are you gonna man up?
come on, now. hands in.
- break!
- straighten up, boy!
- here you go, my lady.
- thank you.
when you said you were
gonna wear a cowboy hat,
i didn't know how i'd feel about it.
now that you've seen me in it,
what's the verdict?
you're sexier than socks on a rooster.
that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.
i mean it, stud.
cute.
remember, you promised.
no fighting.
- willard. don't you look pretty.
- what can i do for you tonight, chuck?
we got some business to take care
of with our friend maccormack.
let's be cool,
no fights tonight, all right?
i get it. no fighting.
willard! are you ok? let go of me!
shut him up.
- maccormack! get on out here, boy!
- willard!
what do you want me to do?
they started this!
then kill the sons of bitches!
russell, handle that now! come on!
hey, chuck!
hey, yankee doodle. why don't you
come on down and get your ass kicked.
you're real tough when it's four to one.
rusty! get your hands off of her!
you freak, don't you
ever touch her like that! ever!
you like that?
you want some more!
yeah! go, dogs!
you want to take me?
yeah, run away like a little bitch!
you wanna dance, boy?
the race is over, chuck.
- ren, ren, watch out!
- play fair, punk!
thanks to mr. beamis.
how about a little less boxing
and a little more boogie?
- it feels like a morgue in there!
- i'm on it.
- you ok?
- yeah. are you ok?
yeah. my little brawler.
you look beautiful, come on!
thank you. i kicked his ass!
hey! i thought this was a party!
let's dance!
- i need you to hold myjacket.
- what are you doing?
back up, sweetheart.
i don't know how big
this is going to get.
