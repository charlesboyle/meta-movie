man: <i>13th of july, 4:50 p.m.</i>
<i>i'm sorry.</i>
<i>i know that means</i>
<i>little at this point.</i>
<i>but i am.</i>
<i>i tried.</i>
<i>i think you would</i>
<i>all agree that i tried</i>
<i>to be true.</i>
<i>to be strong.</i>
<i>to be kind.</i>
<i>to love.</i>
<i>to be right.</i>
<i>but i wasn't.</i>
<i>and i know you knew this.</i>
<i>in each of your ways.</i>
<i>and i am sorry.</i>
<i>all is lost here.</i>
<i>except for soul and body,</i>
<i>that is, what's left of them,</i>
<i>and a half day's ration.</i>
<i>it's inexcusable really,</i>
<i>i know that now.</i>
<i>how it could have taken this long
to admit that, i'm not sure,</i>
<i>but it did.</i>
<i>i fought till the end.</i>
<i>i'm not sure</i>
<i>what that is worth,</i>
<i>but know that i did.</i>
<i>i have always hoped</i>
<i>for more for you all.</i>
<i>i will miss you.</i>
<i>i'm sorry.</i>
