my sweet love.
at last.
my hope.
how i loved you.
how long have you been here?
- a couple of months.
- oh.
how do you like it so far?
i like it.
- and do you have any children?
- i have a daughter.
she's ten.
i bet it's hard being a single mum.
i know my daughter's a little younger,
but it would be fun for them
to get together maybe.
it's kind of a hard age to move away.
- what's going on here?
- we're doing a little remedial work.
remedial work?
we're looking to make sure
there's no toxins.
i got stuff on my house.
kids acting strange.
sometimes we see tar
coming out of the cracks in the patio.
the neighbours here,
they had their house in escrow.
they pulled out.
- the buyers pulled out.
- yeah.
that's too bad.
the reports from the lab came in.
it showed the presence of lead
and cadmium in the surface soil
and in the dust in the school-yards.
i've had it blonde
and brown and pink and red.
me, i could never dye my hair,
unless my mum says i can.
my mum doesn't care.
my mum's pretty cool.
of course.
there is a love
that's like a stream that goes dry
when rain no longer feeds it.
but there is a love
that is like a spring
coming up from the earth.
the first is human love,
the second is divine love
and has its source above.
the husband is to love his wife
as christ loved the church,
and give his life for her.
he does not <i>find</i> her lovely,
he <i>makes</i> her lovely.
but there is a grace
that comes in such a marriage.
i got married when i was 17.
i had a child.
but my husband
started running after other women.
he left us and went
to the canary islands.
other priests have told me
that in the eyes of the church
i'm still married to that man.
they said i couldn't have
the sacraments.
i want to be a wife.
i don't even know
why i was with him in the first place.
and then it sunk in.
i didn't really want to tell my dad,
because i knew he would start yelling,
yelling very loudly, and...
i'd never give her up.
ever.
you see that red band
in the sky right there?
and you see that blue down below it?
that's the earth's shadow
on the atmosphere.
look. you see
what i'm talking about?
stop for a second.
you see?
tatiana...
father,
i'm going to pray for you.
thank you very much.
so you will receive the gift of joy.
me?
because you're so unhappy.
do you get lonely all the time,
or most of the time
when there ain't nobody around?
so, what you got to say about it?
you gotta have a little more excitement.
just like when me and you are around,
and there ain't nobody around.
hey! the power hits you, brother.
it always hits me. you can just say,
hey, power, and it hits me.
hits me before i can get it out.
see, the devil don't know what i'm saying.
and you won't know, and i won't know.
i can feel the warmth of the light, brother.
that's spiritual.
i'm feeling more than just natural light.
feeling the spiritual light, see?
i can almost touch that light,
coming right from the sky.
the parish has grown a lot,
and we really need more room
for the community to get together.
we have plays, we have dinners,
we have parties.
we have ccd in the parish hall.
if i would have known it was there...
thank you.
everything that's happening...
man is in revolt against god.
the prophet hosea saw
in the breakdown of his marriage
the spiritual infidelity of his people.
in that broken marriage,
we see the pattern of our world.
we wish to live
inside the safety of the laws.
we fear to choose.
jesus insists on choice.
the one thing he condemns utterly
is avoiding the choice.
to choose is to commit yourself,
and to commit yourself
is to run the risk of failure,
the risk of sin, the risk of betrayal,
but jesus can deal with all of those.
forgiveness he never denies us.
the man who makes a mistake
can repent.
but the man who hesitates,
who does nothing,
who buries his talent
in the earth with him,
he can do nothing.
these guys who live around here,
they're perfectly happy
until somebody comes around
asking questions,
and it makes everybody nervous,
because...
ain't this is our property?
can't we do what we want with it?
i tell my husband to get us out of here,
but where we gonna go?
they got all these big time lawyers,
and we can't get no help.
even the dog is acting funny.
we've been on this house
for a long time.
you're out at the ranch up there?
i've been there for some time.
i have to look at
some of these creeks and rivers.
you talk to my sister, right?
i'm going over
to the tall grass prairie now.
the ranch is going into receivership.
it's going bankrupt.
and he claimed he didn't want
to have kids while he was in school.
she hadn't changed.
so many student loans,
gambling debts,
and this ranch that's falling apart.
i caught you on the right day.
kind.
i had a child.
a little girl.
she died.
my father...
he said to read romans.
all things work together for good.
he believed that.
will you pray with me?
i had no faith.
you knew.
were you afraid?
my mother says
i'm chasing moonbeams.
- is that what she said?
- mm-hmm.
i told her i'd rather have a moonbeam
than the life i had before.
do you want this?
do you know what you want?
i can't afford to make mistakes
with men any more.
i want you to come more often.
can you?
i've been waiting for you.
i felt wild.
- what?
- i don't know. what are you laughing at?
you.
- me?
- you make me laugh.
you make me happy.
you took me.
no.
girl.
little girl.
fool.
here i am.
yes.
tell her.
i trust you.
i want to be your wife.
i love you.
walk away.
i thought i knew you.
now i don't think you ever were.
what we had was nothing.
you made it into nothing.
pleasure.
lust.
ma'am, if you'll come over here.
sir, if you'll be on this side, please.
y'all have rings for each other?
ok.
to love, honour and cherish you.
be faithful only to you.
as long as we both shall live.
and i do promise
before these witnesses...
and i do promise
before these witnesses...
to love,
honour, and cherish you.
to love, honour
and cherish you.
be faithful only to you.
be faithful only to you.
as long as we both shall live.
as long as we both shall live.
awaken the love.
the divine presence...
...which sleeps in each man,
each woman.
you say,
christ said this, christ said that.
what do you say?
and what you say,
does it come from god within?
answer that which is of god,
in every woman, every man.
know each other in that love
that never changes.
i'd like to show you
here on the monitor...
this is the area of your uterus
and the iud that you have in place there.
we feel like one of the less risky
procedures that we can do
is to remove this device,
and see if those symptoms
don't resolve.
i think something that you
and your husband need to consider
is with the absence of the iud,
is this a time that you might want
to think about children?
or is there another means
for contraception?
so, i don't need to have
a hysterectomy?
that's the good news.
thank you.
so,
would you like to have children?
someday.
god gave us marriage
as a holy mystery,
in which a man and woman
are joined together
and become one.
and with affection and tenderness
freely give themselves to each other.
this ring i give you...
is a sign of our constant faith.
...is a sign
of our constant faith.
and abiding love.
and abiding love.
go.
we pray thy blessings
upon them,
and upon this food
which we are about to eat.
would you like one?
come on.
come on, baby.
things have gotten worse.
i don't understand it.
i don't know what happened. i was drunk.
if i had done this, i'm not saying i did,
i might've, i could've.
i'm asking for forgiveness, father.
i can't... i can't help...
i can't help myself. if you need me
to kneel down, i'll kneel down.
i want to be free.
that sun is just right in my eyes.
i can fight, i will fight.
i can fight with my feet and hands.
they think they're really
about something, but they ain't.
you gonna open that bible
and preach to me now?
lover boy! where are you?
love is not only a feeling.
love is a duty.
you <i>shall</i> love.
love is a command.
and you say,
i can't command my emotions.
they come and go like clouds.
to that, christ says: you shall love.
whether you like it or not.
you fear your love has died.
it perhaps is waiting to be transformed
into something higher.
he's killing me!
i'm sorry.
you want me to die? here!
why don't you have them?
i'm frightened.
ok.
give me your blessing, father.
i've hurt people.
i know what i am.
- the body of christ.
- amen.
the blood of christ.
i thought you went away.
forgive me.
please.
don't take up with anybody
during the first six months.
don't stop talking to people.
that's the first mistake that i see
people make in my practice.
sometimes you eat the bear,
and sometimes the bear eats you.
you can't feel sorry for yourself.
like i explained earlier,
once we get her served
that'll start the process.
because there's no children involved,
this could be a fairly rapid process,
if that's what you want.
i don't want you to lose hope...
it's very hard to be the...
the one who loves less,
the one who's stronger.
you have to struggle with yourself.
you have to struggle
with your own... strength.
why?
i saw you.
again.
they are sending me away.
i won't be here for long.
they're sending me
to western kansas.
western kansas? what are you
gonna do in western kansas?
a lot of people around here
are going to be missing you.
i think we need people like you
here in bartlesville.
to preach the gospel.
that's why we have churches.
i feel a lot of burning, you know.
i have a spot here.
i pray, but sometimes i don't hear him.
i don't think he hears me.
