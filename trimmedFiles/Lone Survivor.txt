six times three.
hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
hurry up.
it's eighteen. ooh!
ring the bell three times,
put your helmet on the ground.
you're done.
commence! you don't make
it, you do it again!
you ever been tested this
hard ever in your life?
never.
winning here is a
conscious decision.
make up your mind
if you want to pass
or choose to fail.
all right now, gentlemen,
i'm gonna introduce y'all
to something called "not
being able to breathe."
andrew! come back.
come back to the light.
all this shaking and all
this cold. harness it.
turn it into aggression.
you just proved to your
bodies, through your mind,
that you can push yourself further
than you thought possible.
go get wet! run!
i'm at my limit, so...
...that's it.
you sure you want to be here?
yes, i do.
are you absolutely sure?
i'm positive!
whatever you have to do!
just find an excuse to win.
keep going.
it pays to be a winner!
i like having my buddies
that i can depend on.
and i would like for them
to be able to depend on me.
these guys are our
band of brothers.
there's a storm inside of us.
i've heard many team
guys speak of this.
a burning.
a river.
a drive.
an unrelenting desire
to push yourself
harder and further than
anyone could think possible.
pushing ourselves into
those cold, dark corners.
where the bad things live.
where the bad things fight.
we wanted that fight
at the highest volume.
aloud fight.
the loudest, coldest, darkest,
most unpleasant of the
unpleasant fights.
is this doable?
it's expensive.
how much?
it's an arabian horse, man.
she got good taste.
i know.
how much?
i'll find out. expensive.
you're fucked, man.
i know.
i'm up.
going down.
murphy by 1.1.
more than that. more
than that, marcus.
fucking dude, i was being
generous. trust me.
who won?
murph. murph, barely.
by one second.
barely.
barely. head shave?
head shave or what? i don't know, you
know? it's something to think about.
if i shave his head, i
have to focus on his face.
face, ears. oddly-shaped head.
well, i don't wanna be looking
at him that close, either,
but he has been running his mouth
about beating you. really?
fuck, a head shave is fair.
axe? better shave him.
make him go eat with the e-3s, work
in the chow hall until it grows back.
frankie, what do you think?
why the fuck wouldn't
we shave him?
that's valid.
patton, not that we care,
but what do you think?
let me see you make a
tactical decision right now.
well, i could go
both ways on this.
he did lose, but he was close.
and you're mike murphy.
you are mike murphy.
the mike murphy.
i would've expected a
bigger separation.
that is a good point.
backhanded compliment.
patton. grab my razor.
razor, copy that.
listen up.
red wings' a go.
tonight, 1800.
beautiful.
am i going?
plo in an hour.
maybe i'll go.
it's a maybe. i'll give you
a maybe. stay optimistic.
boys. hey, what's up?
what the fuck am
i doing wrong?
oh, come on.
i'll tell you what, shane,
here's your first op.
you ready?
clean all this up.
the objective of this mission is
to capture and kill ahmad shah.
bad guy. senior
taliban commander
responsible for killing marines
in eastern afghanistan.
a tier i target.
if you want a positive i.d.,
note that shah has no earlobes.
taraq.
his right-hand man. seems to do
most of his chief shit for him.
we're going in with a
four-man recon team.
axelson, you'll be point.
myself, i'll be second.
dietz, comms.
marcus, rear, med.
axe, give us our route.
we're gonna be moving up the
back side of this mountain here,
which is gonna offer great
concealment from the village.
i'm estimating that it's
gonna take us between
three and four hours, depending
upon the gradient of the terrain
which is that crappy shale.
so please lace up.
first things first. you're
gonna win the fight.
no medicine in a gun fight.
two weeks ago, team 8 was
near where we're gonna be.
capelli got bit
by a rattlesnake.
contrary to popular belief,
there is poison oak,
so watch your cock and balls,
'cause that will suck.
murph's got the sat phone.
the angle of this region is very
steep. expect typical comms problems.
we're gonna be on
two-hour comms windows.
if we miss two windows, i'd say wake
somebody up. if not, don't sweat it.
way point one is budweiser.
way point two is miller.
three is corona.
four is heineken.
and for our o.p. 1,
schlitz malt liquor.
and if and when we i.d.
shah, pass rick james.
gentlemen, these are your rules of
engagement. us forces will comply
with the law of armed
conflict at all times.
use of deadly force
is authorized.
allahu akbar!
if you do come under attack,
use the appropriate force necessary
to deter or defeat that threat.
leaving here at 1800. two
chinooks and two apaches.
we fly here to the l.z., insert
the four-man team right here.
then we fly 30
minutes to j-bad.
here, we'll have 15 team guys
and about a dozen marines
standing by all night.
when we hear "schlitz malt
liquor", we're heading back
to ba-gram for phase two.
the qrf will stay
here at j-bad.
now the apaches stay
with the black hawks.
the movement is so we can
get the 47's back here
ready to bring up to phrase
two, once you get eyes on shah.
oh,
i bringing up tomorrow night's new
guy presentation to 1400 today,
so that all may
revel and partake.
you better be good, napoleon.
fuck.
a lot of moving parts.
we were going to wait and then
she gets her head into it
and when she gets her head
into something, that's it.
there's no stopping her, man.
she's going all out.
you know, you should
just let her do it.
you got a handyman woman.
that's a good thing.
he's afraid of losing
control over his castle.
he's having control issues
'cause he's the one
who's always made the taste
decisions in the family, right?
no, she's got great taste.
i... i trust her.
well, what does she like?
rose honeydew.
oh. is that a color?
mm-mmm.
you better control
that situation.
it's very ongoing.
new grass leads to new
bushes by the windows,
leads to new curtains,
leads to new sofa,
leads to new carpet,
leads to new floor.
new baby.
dude, she's pregnant?
how far along is she?
you know if it's
a boy or a girl?
no, she's not pregnant. she's
just on a weird journey,
moving through the house,
one room to the next.
sounds expensive.
sounds pregnant.
congratulations.
you're fucking late.
sir, i'm good to go.
no.
you should introduce yourself
and tell us something
about you we don't know.
all right. petty officer...
oh, shut up!
get out!
shut the fuck up!
hey. settle down.
give the kid a chance. remember
what it was like for you.
petty officer...
who gives a shit!
shut the fuck up!
mr. patton, please.
there we go.
more neck.
come on, dude, you got to
get into it. lose yourself.
yeah!
whoa!
whoo!
really, really bad.
dude, that was traumatizing.
can we vote to
push him through?
because i can't see
that ever again.
hands up. push him through!
i don't know. can he say it?
can you say it? prove it!
i don't want to watch you
dance again. i really don't.
can you say it, mr. patton?
i can say it, i can say it.
uh... don't fuck it up.
come on. no more fucking around.
come on.
been around the world twice.
talked to everyone once.
seen two whales fuck. been
to three world fairs.
i even know a man in
thailand with a wooden cock.
i push more peter more
sweeter and more completer
than any other peter
pusher around.
i'm a hard-bodied,
hairy-chested,
rooting tooting shooting,
parac' hutting
demolition double-cap
crimping frogman.
there ain't nothing
i can't do.
no sky too high, no sea too
rough, no muff too tough.
learned a lot of
lessons in my life.
never shoot a large-caliber man
with a small-caliber bullet.
drive all kinds of trucks.
two-bys, four-bys, six-bys.
and those big motherfuckers
that bend and go, "ssh-ssh"
when you step on the brakes.
anything in life worth doing is worth
overdoing. moderation is for cowards.
i'm a lover, i'm a fighter,
i'm a udt navy seal diver.
i'll wine, dine, intertwine,
and sneak out the back door
when the refueling is done.
so if you're feeling froggy,
then you better jump,
because this frogman's been there,
done that and is going back for more.
cheers, boys.
she does not need
an arabian horse!
how the fuck do you
know about that?
i know everything, murphy.

walker cross stallion.

lone ranger's horse.

i am calling on an
unsecured line.
i need to speak to the c.o.
immediately.
the c.o.? that's correct.
which c.o., sir?
commander kristensen.
commander kristensen
isn't here, sir.
ah, he's at ba-gram.

i need you to transfer me

mike murphy? yeah.
that's mike murphy?
well, go get him.
commander kristensen?
commander kristensen?
sir, sorry, sir.
i got lieutenant murphy on the
phone for you in the toc.
he says he needs to
talk to you now.
which one?
right there.
mike? mike?
oh, it dropped.
mike?
it's dead. what did he say?
uh, just that he
needed to talk to you.
why is murphy calling
on a sat phone?
no idea.
are we having comms
problems with spartan o-1?
we were good for a while, but we've
missed two windows now, sir.
two.
try him back! for fuck's sake.
fuck! worst fucking comms.
well, we could light
the goats on fire,
smoke signal our
way out of here.
yeah, i could walk down to the
village, ask to borrow a phone.
you'd get some interesting
tile ideas down there, bro.
afghan dirt brown,
goat skin blond.
shit, she'll dig that a
hell of a lot more than,
what is it, fucking
honey cream?
sit down. sit down!
way i see it, we
got three options.
one, we let them go, hike up.
we'll probably be found
in less than an hour.
two, we tie them up,
hike out, roll the dice.
they'll probably be eaten by fucking
wolves, or freeze to death.
three?
we terminate the compromise.
shah's down there. we let them go,
we're letting him go. mission fails.
no, mikey.
i don't like it. i don't
fucking like it at all.
what are we gonna do? we
gonna kill them? huh?
okay, we kill them, right? what,
then what? fucking bury 'em?
they get found, then what?
then what?
what do you mean, then what?
and then what?
you know then what.
what do you think? this
shit's gonna be private?
huh? it's gonna be out there
for the whole fucking world.
cnn, okay? "seals kill kids."
that's the fucking
story forever.
it's nobody's fucking
business what we do up here.
we do what we do.
what we have to do.
this is the fucking navy and
you're the fucking boss,
so you make the
fucking call, sir.
shah killed 20
marines last week.
twenty.
we let him go, 20 more
will die next week.
forty more the week after that.
our job is to stop shah.
why do these men have the right
to dictate how we do our job?
rules of engagement says
we cannot touch them.
i understand.
and i don't care.
i care about you.
i care about you.
i care about you.
i care about you.
i don't want your mom
seeing your head,
your decapitated
head on al jazeera.
that is shah.
i don't see it that way.
where do you think he's running
to? 200 friends down there.
got guys in leavenworth doing
what do you think
they're gonna do
for two fucking kids and
an old fucking man?
fucking look at them, man.
they fucking hate us.
look, at him. that's not a kid, that's a
soldier. that's death. look at death.
we can't do it. look
at that soldier.
they are unarmed prisoners.
and the second they run down there,
we got 200 hajis on our backs.
tie 'em up.
tie 'em up. let's get
the fuck out of here.
we can't just fucking
leave 'em, let 'em go!
i thought you were standing by
waiting for your fucking orders?
i am standing by waiting
for my fucking orders.
what do you think
that radio's for?
they're not calling
domino's pizza.
i know what the
fucking radio's for.
that radio's fucking tali.
it's a cell phone
to the taliban.
so you just think it'll just
be our little secret? huh?
that's a warrior.
schwack them.
we cannot do that.
this is a soft compromise.
you want to go to leavenworth?
you don't know how many hajis
they have down there, man.
don't let him influence you.
marcus, i'm just saying,
you can't just say...
look at that child.
make up your fucking mind and
don't let him influence you.
schwack them.
mikey, it's your fucking call.
i ain't fucking voting.
this is not a vote.
this is what we're gonna do.
this op is compromised.
so we're going to
pack up everything.
we're gonna cut them loose and
we're gonna make this peak.
when we make this peak,
you're gonna get comms up.
when we get these comms up, we're gonna
call for extract and we're going home.
roger that, sir.
roger that. roger.

brave men have fought and died
building the proud tradition
and fear of reputation
that i am bound to uphold.
i died up on that mountain.
no pulse. okay, start cpr.

there is no question
a part of me will forever be
up on that mountain, dead...

because of them, i
am still alive.
and i can never forget that
no matter how much it hurts,
how dark it gets, or
how far you fall...
hey, luttrell. luttrell!
