look, we could use the shipment to parade
in front of the media,
get a few hundred pounds of heroin
off the street,
but braga's just gonna send another shipment next week and the week after that.
let's use the shipment
to lure braga out
and lop the head off
a multi-billion dollar cartel.
and how do you
suggest we do that?
a hand-to-hand
exchange with braga.
he'll never show.
he can't afford not to.
you got a plan?
there's a price.
we bag braga,
you let toretto walk.

it's dom.
i was just

what circumstances?
me being alive?
don't take it personaiiy.
lt's just business.
i got some business
of my own.
get campos.
lt's them.
uh-huh.
was that how braga inspires loyalty?
killing his drivers?
one can always
find more drivers.
it's just good business.
l want to trade.
braga doesn't negotiate.
<font color="#d900d9">(scoffs)</font> fine.
you explain to him how all of a sudden $60 million worth of product disappears.
l know that can't
be good for business.
what do you want?
six million cash,
delivered by braga himself.
<font color="#d900d9">(laughlng)</font>
i don't iike being shot at.
l ain't gonna put my neck out again unless he's got something to lose, too.
he'll never go for it.

you helped escape the law's grasp.
as of now,
you're being taken off active duty,
until this house can
mount a formal inquiry.
what about braga?
that's no longer
your concern.
we now know where braga is,
right?
customs tracked him via satellite to his home base in tecali, mexico.
mexico is out

the fact is
