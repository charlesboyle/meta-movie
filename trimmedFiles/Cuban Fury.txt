it's their time up there,
but it's our time down here.
you can do this, bruce.
you can win this mother-funky
and you can show the world
what you're really made of.
think about it. what
have we go to lose?
yeah, i mean, i suppose i could.
bruce, we persians have a saying.
<font color="#808080">(speaks farsi)</font>
- i... i don't really speak farsi.
- if you want to do something do it.
if you don't want to do it,
don't do it.
<font color="#808080">(bleeping)</font>
i'm going to be late for my
ball wax. i'll call you later.
- yeah, sure.

<font color="#804040">bruce</font>: i can still see you there.
- <font color="#804040">bajen</font>: see you.
- see you later.
hello. one, two, three,
four, five. yes.
- you win.
- finally. finally.
now, you know what you get
for first prize, you lucky prick.
- i dread to think.
- you get one of these.
- and there it is.
- and...
two of these.
i just thought you might want an old
pair of shitty shoes from the '80s.
one careful owner.
thanks, ron.
you're not going to try and
finger me now, are you?
- you want me to try and finger you?
- you're ready.
you... are free.
i'm going to ask her to
this thing tomorrow night
and i would be honoured if
you would come and watch us.
ah, i'll have to check my diary.
thank you.
look at them.
- they're so soft.
- mm.
<font color="#808080">(breaths out and sniffs)</font>
don't... don't do that.

come on.
she's not at work today.
<font color="#804040">sam</font>: 'fine, so do it tomorrow.'
no, i can't. it is tonight, all right?
i have to do it tonight.
in that case, you are
a tiny bit fucked.
sam, please, i really
need you to just help me.
ok, do exactly as i say
and do not deviate.
you go home, you shower, you
shave, you put on something nice.
i'm thinking powder blue,
shirt not trousers.
do not put on powder blue trousers.
then you get a taxi to her house.
someone will know where she lives.
you knock on her door.
you knock her off her feet
with your confident
suggestion of a night out.
she immediately says yes, then
you whisk her off to the club.
you dance the competition.
you win the competition.
we all get shit-faced,
then we all go home, got it?
<font color="#808080">(chuckles)</font>

ooh, by the way, thanks
for that mixed tape.
that was a hit.
- you gave it to her?
- oh, yeah, she bloody loved it.
thought it was very sweet.
i think i'm going to put it on when
we seal the deal for the first time.
you know, a bit of
sex-muzak, set the mood.
don't be jealous, big lad.
i'm sure she'll still have room in
her life for a fat best friend.
you don't know about me.
what don't i know?

wait, did you not tell bruce
about tonight, or helen?
- did i tell bruce and helen?
- was this all part of your plan?
i can't... i might have.
i don't think i mentioned it.
all right, this conversation
is definitely over.
just please take your
little italian shoes
and your pudding and just get out.
can i just say i think that
you are making a big mistake?
i'm going to have you transferred
to plastic mouldings on monday.
oh, that's bullshit! that's
just a bad managerial...
you know what? fyi i didn't
make that shitty mix tape.

may now seem foolish.

still there in 15 seconds,
