{1286}{1357}what's happening right now|is important only in the context...
{1359}{1411}of our continuing evolution|as a species.
{1414}{1493}roger, all i'm saying is that i wish my|sister would learn to read a subway map.
{1495}{1546}by saying that, you disregard|the primary importance...
{1549}{1608}of utility in human relationships.
{1611}{1687}our ability--|men's ability to read maps...
{1689}{1723}to navigate, makes us useful.
{1726}{1795}you should discourage your sister|from even looking at a map.
{1797}{1897}are you saying that we women|have an inferior sense of direction?.
{1915}{1967}which way is north,joyce,|without looking around?.
{1970}{2003}what?.
{2006}{2051}you heard me. point north.|quick. north.
{2054}{2085}quick. north.
{2087}{2123}north. north.
{2178}{2231}- you're right.|- is he right?.
{2234}{2275}- he's right.|- very impressive.
{2278}{2329}as she has throughout history...
{2331}{2416}the female responds to the male|who displays the most utility.
{2419}{2487}by honing those skills|which make me useful...
{2490}{2568}i stave off|my inevitable obsolescence.
{2571}{2635}you stay home honing your ability|to program a vcr?.
{2637}{2711}my vcr's been flashing 1 2:00|for three years.
{2743}{2789}what else, roger?.
{2791}{2885}oh, driving a standard shift.|lifting heavy things.
{2887}{2937}- air guitar.|- yes, yes.
{2939}{2983}go ahead and chuckle, okay?.
{2986}{3065}but until women evolve the ability|to move objects telepathically--
{3067}{3103}and they will--
{3105}{3156}physical strength|remains a primary utility.
{3159}{3203}here's to brute strength then.
{3253}{3362}roger, you're forgetting|a very important male utility.
{3364}{3395}what's that?. barbecuing?.
{3471}{3495}sex.
{3498}{3603}yeah. i want a guy to do more|than just program my vcr.
{3605}{3699}oh, i'll program your vcr, baby,|like you never had it.
{3702}{3756}it's a top-loader.|you thinkyou can handle that?.
{3759}{3818}interestingly, a group of scientists|in england...
{3821}{3889}just announced their intention|to fertilize an egg...
{3891}{3939}without the use of sperm cells.
{3979}{4011}i don't understand that.
{4013}{4108}every cell in the human body|contains a copy of the genome pattern.
{4111}{4182}the only reason sperm cells|have all the fun is that up until now...
{4185}{4231}they were the only ones with access.
{4233}{4287}within christopher's lifetime,|artificial insemination...
{4290}{4373}will render sperm as useless|as an assembly line worker in detroit.
{4375}{4455}luckily, my accountant set up a golden|parachute for my sperm years ago.
{4458}{4511}in case they were downsized.
{4545}{4629}just so you know, roger,|you know that we women...
{4659}{4719}make love because we like it.
{4722}{4771}- not just to procreate.|- yes.
{4774}{4868}- but are men absolutely necessary?.|- i don't know that.
{4871}{4916}think of the structure|of the female genitalia.
{4919}{4982}wait. wait.|okay, got it.
{5011}{5071}what is the most sensitive part|of the vagina?.
{5074}{5165}-i can't believe we've gotten into this.|-i thinkyou know this, donovan.
{5167}{5262}it's the clitoris, first discovered|by renaldus columbus in 1 559.
{5265}{5297}he thought it was india.
{5347}{5396}oh, no!. no!.
{5399}{5475}the crown of the clitoris|contains 8,000 nerve fibers.
{5477}{5547}it's a far great concentration|than in any part of the male body...
{5549}{5579}even our fingertips.
{5581}{5655}it is the most efficient,|pleasure-delivery system...
{5658}{5699}ever devised by nature.
{5701}{5740}now, ask yourself...
{5743}{5819}why didn't the clitoris end up|inside the vagina...
{5821}{5881}so that intercourse|would be naturally...
{5883}{5948}compellingly, constantly pleasurable|for a woman?.
{5951}{6003}- i know the answer.|- yes, ms. maynard.
{6006}{6121}because in primitive time,|women died of childbirth.
{6123}{6192}so for intercourse to be|too pleasurable...
{6195}{6257}wouldn't make sense|from a darwinian standpoint.
{6259}{6331}- i'm impressed.|- absolutely right.
{6333}{6407}- what does that tell us?.|- evolution is looking out for us girls?.
{6410}{6452}- exactly.|- that for women...
{6455}{6545}intercourse and sexual fulfillment|were never intended to intersect.
{6581}{6633}new technology|just makes it official.
{6635}{6752}future generations ofwomen will evolve|clitorises-- "clitori, clitorati"--
{6755}{6785}"clitorissimo."
{6878}{6963}that are larger, longer,|even more sensitive.
{6966}{7040}and a woman's ability, as well as|her desire to self-stimulate...
{7043}{7088}will increase exponentially...
{7091}{7148}as intercourse is robbed|of its procreative utility.
{7179}{7223}- i'm confused and frightened.|- you should be.
{7225}{7316}the species is not static.|we're in a constant state of flux.
{7319}{7390}two genders has been|the default setting for one reason only:
{7393}{7447}so far it's been the only way|to propagate the race.
{7450}{7495}is there any species|that just has one gender...
{7498}{7558}that doesn't have male/female?.
{7561}{7595}starfish, for one.
{7597}{7672}next time i see a starfish,|i'm gonna tell him to go fuck himself.
{7713}{7745}come on. you love it.
{7775}{7817}no, we don't.
{7851}{7895}so where are we headed?.
{7898}{7949}equality?.|equality, what is that?.
{7991}{8023}is that a principle of nature?.
{8025}{8091}we all sit around|reading subway maps together.
{8094}{8145}no. of course not.|natural selection.
{8147}{8208}now that is a principle of nature.
{8211}{8272}selection. something has to lose.|something has to be defeated...
{8275}{8329}in order for something else|to be selected.
{8331}{8379}so, what does this mean?.
{8454}{8516}we have to take orders from joyce|for the rest of lives.
{8539}{8579}that's right. i like that.
{8582}{8650}it means that 1 0 or 1 5 generations|from now...
{8652}{8701}men will be reduced to servitude.
{8748}{8799}technology and evolution|will have combined...
{8802}{8867}to exclude sperm from procreation...
{8870}{8963}and our final destiny will be|to lift couches...
{8966}{9046}and wait for that day|when telepathy overcomes gravity...
{9048}{9163}and our gender's last remaining utility|is lost forever.
{9166}{9197}forever.
{9214}{9255}oh, my god, roger.
{9327}{9409}- what?. i'm done.|- then i rest my case.
{9522}{9557}thank you.
{9601}{9640}love you people.
{9829}{9864}yeah, this is good.
{11180}{11247}-jesus!.|- no, just me.
{11287}{11332}how did you get in here?.
{11399}{11468}- where did you get those?.|- copied them from yours.
{11471}{11562}- when?.|- last week when you sent me for bagels.
{11621}{11651}give them to me.
{11653}{11712}aren't you tired of constantly|having to buzz me in here?.
{11715}{11801}see how your brain works?. how does|once a week turn into "constantly"?.
{11803}{11901}actually, last week was two times,|including, i believe, friday...
{11903}{12008}when you woke me out of a dead, pleasant|sleep and demanded the use of my body.
{12011}{12062}- you could have said no.|- what?. are you kidding me?.
{12065}{12105}that was a call to action.
{12107}{12160}i dressed in 30 seconds|like a volunteer fireman.
{12163}{12186}i was insane--
{12188}{12271}you should stop talking and listen|to me. i got something to say to you.
{12274}{12307}oh, yeah?.
{12309}{12387}- words are my stock-in-trade,joyce.|- i know.
{12389}{12455}you can't just|stop up the floodgate.
{12457}{12504}- put that down.|- what?.
{12540}{12581}- we need to stop this.|- stop what?.
{12583}{12648}god, i love watching you|in the bathroom.
{12651}{12757}you're like an athlete after the game,|scraping off the war paint.
{12759}{12815}i meant, we need to stop|seeing each other.
{12818}{12857}oh, really?.
{12901}{12947}this whole thing was a bad idea.
{12949}{13024}generally, i have good judgment,|but this time, right out the window.
{13027}{13108}this whole thing is a great idea.|nobody knows about us.
{13111}{13163}we all go out, i sit there and...
{13166}{13207}you know, a few hours later...
{13210}{13257}i know i'm going to be|the traveling salesman...
{13259}{13315}and you're going to be|the lonely housewife.
{13318}{13434}i need you to be an adult about this.|no scenes.
{13436}{13514}joyce, i am your boy.|i'm your thoroughbred.
{13516}{13579}adult. understand?.
{13619}{13694}forget about the keys, okay?.|just keep the keys with--
{13906}{14019}tonight is our last night,|so let's make it a good one.
{14118}{14157}good-bye sex is never good.
{14159}{14207}next week, we'll have|"get back together" sex--
{14399}{14460}- can i stay the night?.|- roger, no.
{16561}{16592}right.
{16897}{16984}hi. can i have a cosmo and|a maker's mark on the rocks?. thanks.
{16987}{17070}- let's have a talk.|- i'm sorry. i'm with some people.
{17073}{17101}let me guess.
{17159}{17202}you're relatively new at the company.
{17204}{17299}maybe you moved to new york from|somewhere else. somewhere friendly.
{17358}{17411}first you took pride in being alone.
{17413}{17480}wanna make a name foryourself|in the big city.
{17483}{17570}after a while, you started thinking|how it might be nice to meet somebody.
{17572}{17659}winter's not far off,|and it gets lonely sometimes.
{17689}{17747}okay. and?.
{17766}{17838}and so you develop a crush|on your supervisor...
{17885}{17943}even though the other women|in the office tell you...
{17946}{17994}" keep clear. he's bad news."
{17997}{18051}- why is he bad news?.|- because he's a player.
{18071}{18132}he's a guy who collects trophies.
{18135}{18198}every woman who takes a job there|ends up in bed with him.
{18233}{18279}and ifyou give in to temptation...
{18281}{18363}you'll end up the punch line|to a sordid joke by the water cooler.
{18366}{18401}am i hot or cold?.
{18469}{18539}- it's a good story.|- it's a cliche.
{18542}{18589}so what do you do|when you're not reducing the world?.
{18591}{18655}what's wrong with reduction,|boiling things down to their essence?.
{18658}{18751}what's wrong with...|seeing what's really going on?.
{18754}{18827}and what's really going on?.|what's the big revelation?.
{18850}{18892}why should i tell you?.
{18895}{18950}telling you|isn't going to change anything.
{18952}{19059}for instance, i could tell you that|what you think of as your personality...
{19061}{19127}is nothing but a collection|of van aarticles.
{19130}{19236}i could tell you your choice|of sexual partners this evening...
{19239}{19307}was decided months ago by some|account executive at young  rubicam.
{19310}{19387}i could tell you that|given a week to study your father...
{19389}{19440}and the ways|in which he ignores you...
{19443}{19523}i could come up with a schtick|you'd be helpless to resist. helpless.
{19635}{19704}i could tell you all that, but what|would you do with the information?.
{19707}{19766}are there women|who fall for this stuff?.
{19798}{19837}i'm telling the truth as i see it.
{19839}{19906}you wanna go fuckyour boss?.|what business is it of mine.
{20009}{20090}he's not daddy.|he's just a guy in a suit.
{20204}{20297}you feel compelled to contribute|to the pathetic...
{20299}{20370}heartbreaking predictability of it all,|by all means--
{20871}{20907}- hi.|- hi.
{21015}{21108}- you waiting for someone?.|- yeah, my fiance.
{21111}{21192}- hey, congratulations.|- thanks.
{21255}{21325}all right. congratulations.
{21439}{21475}is he a kind man,|your fiance?.
{21478}{21525}does he treat you with respect?.
{21552}{21618}not that it's any ofyour business,|but, yes, he does.
{21650}{21740}- that must make you nervous.|- why would that make me nervous?.
{21743}{21802}oh, come on.
{21804}{21873}look at the time.|let's do the math together.
{21875}{21916}what are you talking about?.
{21919}{21995}let me guess, low self-esteem...
{21998}{22120}and premenopausal... concern|led you to pursue a series of--
{22166}{22199}semiabusive relationships?.
{22201}{22307}but a recent dose of therapy|has convinced you...
{22310}{22362}that inner-beauty|is what really matters, and...
{22407}{22531}you really deserve that perfect partner|who treats you with such respect.
{22534}{22580}do you want me to call|the bartender?.
{22583}{22629}unless you're an idiot--|which i don't thinkyou are--
{22631}{22677}unless you're some kind|of pathetic, self-help junkie...
{22679}{22742}you and i know your guy's gonna|wake up one morning, and--
{22773}{22829}he's gonna look around,|figure out how old you are...
{22831}{22907}and what you're really like,|and that's the day he's gonna go out...
{22910}{22957}for a pack of smokes|and never come back.
{22975}{23019}by that time--|how you doing?.
{23050}{23121}if she doesn't see what's coming,|i fucking weep for her.
{23442}{23496}- can i help you, sir?.|- hey. no, thanks. i'm good.
{23499}{23541}i said, "can i help you, sir?'
{23586}{23679}- where's that other guy?. the--|- he's home sleeping.
{23681}{23771}okay. well, it's very important that|i see joyce maynard right away, so--
{23774}{23837}okay. i understand.|why don't i just leave her a note?.
{23898}{23939}it's important|that i see her in person.
{23942}{24004}that's not gonna work,|so why don't i...
{24007}{24063}call you a cab and you go home|and sleep it off?.
{24066}{24116}why don't you go fucking home?.
{24119}{24181}okay. you know what?.|we don't understand each other.
{24183}{24277}i'm her boy. i'm her boy, okay?.|who are you?. who are you?.

{28195}{28265}- bye, donna.|- i'll call you back in five minutes.
{28267}{28358}"five minutes"?.|this is a five-minute situation?.
{28360}{28400}sit down.
{28403}{28452}i don't wish to sit down.|i wish to stand.
{28476}{28523}did you try to get|into my building last night?.
{28579}{28642}why am i not invited tonight?.|everyone will be there except me.
{28644}{28692}what is that going to look like?.
{28747}{28817}- let's reestablish some boundaries.|- let's not.
{28863}{28936}i'm your boss.|you work for me.
{28939}{28991}you write very good copy.
{29027}{29153}but i have a hundred resumes|on my files for guys just like you.
{29155}{29220}but do those guys|do that thing that i do?.
{29223}{29265}the thing that you like?.
{29286}{29402}i have explained to you that i do not|wish to see you socially any longer.
{29600}{29647}find a way to deal with it.
{29916}{29967}what's that supposed to do?.
{30737}{30765}nick?.
{30819}{30863}uncle roger.|how's it going?.
{30904}{30947}what are you doing here?.
{30970}{31035}what?. oh.|i wanted to see where you work.
{31063}{31152}- yes. no. what are you doing here?.|- what?.
{31155}{31220}- you mean here in new york here?.|- yes.
{31223}{31307}i had an interview at columbia,|so mom said i should lookyou up.
{31310}{31380}- sit down.|- okay.
{31383}{31428}that's what all the phone calls|were about.
{31431}{31487}- the phone calls?.|- yeah. your mom's been calling me.
{31490}{31577}- did you speak to her?.|- we're playing phone tag.
{31579}{31633}she said you could|show me what you do here.
{31635}{31683}she did?.
{31685}{31761}well, there's not a whole lot|to show you, nick.
{31763}{31841}really?. like, what do you do all day?.
{31843}{31891}what do i do all day?.
{31914}{31979}i sit here and think ofways|to make people feel bad.
{32018}{32083}- i thought you wrote for commercials.|- i do...
{32086}{32157}but you can't sell a product|without first making people feel bad.
{32176}{32207}why not?.
{32273}{32320}because it's a substitution game.
{32347}{32409}you have to remind them that they're|missing something from their lives.
{32411}{32455}everyone's missing something, right?.
{32458}{32504}- well, yeah. i guess.|- trust me.
{32507}{32569}and when they're feeling|sufficiently incomplete...
{32571}{32646}you convince them that your product is|the only thing that can fill the void.
{32648}{32702}so, instead of taking steps|to deal with their lives...
{32704}{32794}instead ofworking to root out|the real reason for their misery...
{32796}{32866}they run out and buy|a stupid-looking pair of cargo pants.
{33069}{33159}- so... is it fun?.|- it can be.
{33162}{33229}look, i actually was about|to call it a day.
{33231}{33279}that's cool.|we can go get something to eat.
{33343}{33428}- fine. let's get out of here.|- great.
{34019}{34087}you gave me a scare. i thought you|were having a narcoleptic episode.
{34090}{34175}- what?. when?.|- back at the office, you know?.
{34211}{34271}that's standing meditation.|it calms me down. thanks.
{34274}{34331}why should you calm down?.|you're a teenager. thankyou.
{34334}{34381}my brain gets all sloppy|when i'm stressed...
{34383}{34447}so the meditation helps me focus|and block out the bad stuff.
{34450}{34516}- bad stuff?.|- like fear and pain, you know?.
{34519}{34608}it's a visualization. i picture|a blue triangle, and that's me.
{34611}{34697}i put all the other stuff outside|the triangle in a red field. it works.
{34755}{34798}so, how's your folks?.
{34919}{34992}- they got divorced.|- what?.
{34995}{35043}yeah. my dad moved out.
{35046}{35103}- you're kidding. when did this happen?.|- a while ago.
{35106}{35163}i haven't seen you|since grandma's funeral.
{35309}{35360}- jesus, nick. i'm sorry to hear that.|- it's no big deal.
{35363}{35422}i still talk to my dad.|he calls from the road.
{35425}{35461}how's your mom doing?.
{35463}{35496}she's fine. you know.
{35545}{35600}- surprised she didn't come with you.|- maybe she was afraid to see you...
{35603}{35647}after what happened at the funeral.
{35650}{35723}that happened because|your grandfather's a king-size prick.
{35783}{35821}all right?.
{36042}{36084}so when's your interview?.
{36117}{36178}- it was today.|- how'd it go?.
{36180}{36237}fine, i guess. i did the interviews|'cause mom wants me to.
{36239}{36305}- you're not interested in college?.|- why keep going to school...
{36307}{36369}when anything i need to find out about|i can look up myself?.
{36371}{36437}dad didn't go to college. by the time|he was my age, he was on the road.
{36439}{36495}- how is everything here?.|- first-rate. thanks.
{36535}{36659}but... the good thing about college|is you get to hang out a lot.
{36662}{36719}- it's good for the social skills.|- yeah.
{36819}{36944}so... my mom says you're kind of,|you know, like a ladies' man.
{36947}{37024}- she said that?.|- but she says it like it's a bad thing.
{37027}{37074}that sounds like her.
{37093}{37175}- is it true?.|- what about you?. you have a girlfriend?.
{37218}{37313}no. i mean, you know, not yet.
{37350}{37461}look. i'm getting older, and there's|a lot of stuff that i wish i could--
{37547}{37651}there's a lot of stuff that i haven't--|there's certain things i need to--
{37654}{37701}yeah. i thought you said|you could look that stuff up.
{37703}{37751}no. i mean, not this.
{37754}{37820}you don't understand. i need|someone who knows what to say--
{37823}{37889}i'm kidding you, nick.|that's what college is for.
{37891}{38011}you find some football player who needs|tutoring, and he helps you get girls.
{38014}{38085}- you don't get it.|- i get it. i was 1  once, all right?.
{38107}{38164}what are you going to do|ifyou don't go to college?.
{38167}{38223}design software.|maybe work on simulation games.
{38226}{38285}that's right. you're the computer whiz.|there is money in that.
{38287}{38335}i already make money|setting up systems for people.
{38337}{38395}i'm working on a web page|for granddad for his research.
{38397}{38458}what, the old man?.|he's actually spending money?.
{38460}{38489}yeah, good money too.
{38491}{38548}it's funny, 'cause he yells|at his computer like it's a person.
{38551}{38600}he's always going,|"that bitch ate my file."
{38603}{38687}- or, "she's playing hard to get."|- you spend a lot of time there?.
{38690}{38713}yeah, nowadays.
{38715}{38792}i go over after school, and he|comes over and eats dinner with us.
{38795}{38887}wait a minute.|he eats dinner with you and susan?.
{38890}{38983}sure. since grandma died,|there's no one taking care ofhim.
{38986}{39055}even after they split up,|she went over every day to cook dinner.
{39058}{39145}i mean, every single day.|she was nuts.
{39257}{39304}yeah, she was nuts.
{39399}{39431}so, nick.
{39479}{39530}you need some help with the ladies?.
{39612}{39666}all right. here we go.|get this straight.
{39667}{39768}sex is everywhere, okay?.|it is all around us.
{39771}{39841}it's not some distant destination.|it's not everest.
{39843}{39929}it is right here.|you have to attune yourself to it.
{39931}{39977}you have to bring yourself|into alignment.
{39979}{40025}you have to find|the zone, nick. okay?.
{40027}{40114}do that, and i promise you|a whole world will open up.
{40142}{40223}look at me. i walk around|in a state of total receptivity.
{40225}{40304}- i'm like a fucking lightning rod.|- all right. fine. what do i do?.
{40335}{40407}for starters, let's get rid of that|little meditation. the blue triangle.
{40410}{40494}we don't block things out, nicholas.|we let them in.
{40497}{40530}let what in?.
{40532}{40588}there are millions ofwomen|in this city.
{40591}{40668}millions. most ofthem are blessedly|unaware of the countless ways...
{40671}{40736}in which their bodies|are exposed to our eyes.
{40739}{40803}so, first, learn to read the sun,|where it sits.
{40806}{40943}you'll notice... correlation between|backlighting and transparency.
{40945}{41018}they wear light-colored clothing,|underwear shows right through.
{41020}{41091}bra straps, panty lines.|no need to stretch or squint.
{41093}{41192}it is there for us, okay?.|for example--
{41375}{41400}what?.
{41403}{41460}are you blowing my cover|like some construction worker?.
{41463}{41535}- no. i was just--|- use your head.
{41557}{41659}step back. let her pass.|okay?. give it a few seconds.
{41662}{41743}watch this, and then camouflage|the move. pay attention.
{41845}{41909}checking of the watch is good.|or of the pager.
{41911}{41973}or looking for|a street sign like you're lost.
{41975}{42038}you saw me do a combination.|whatever it is, don't get caught.
{42040}{42103}do you think women have a clue|what goes on up here?.
{42106}{42191}what do they think,|it's just stock quotes, drill bit sizes?.
{42194}{42258}they don't know shit!|let's keep it that way.
{42261}{42351}- all right.|- watch. what about your eyes?.
{42354}{42415}- what?. my eyes?.|- your eyes. how's your vision?.
{42418}{42479}- no, it's good. it's 20-20.|- okay. peripheral?.
{42482}{42547}- i don't know. it's fine, i guess.|- fine's not gonna cut it.
{42550}{42633}you gotta workyour muscles like you're|training for the fucking olympics.
{42635}{42702}- yeah.|- up, down, left, right, et cetera.
{42773}{42814}- here. follow my finger.|- okay.
{42816}{42855}- tell me when it's gone.|- all right.
{42876}{42933}- okay. stop.|- that's it?.
{42935}{42986}you need a hundred,|a hundred and ten degrees...
{42989}{43043}before you're ready for the street.
{43046}{43093}i see behind me on a good day.
{43111}{43147}- you play video games?.|- sure.
{43150}{43195}good. that stuff is training|for the eyes.
{43198}{43221}registering images|in a split second.
{43223}{43274}it's invaluable.|oh. right there.
{43277}{43338}blue sweater. blue sweater.|median. blue sweater. blue sweater.
{43432}{43498}that young lady just--|and you missed it.
{43500}{43549}- i know.|- in just a fraction of a second.
{43551}{43640}that's all. but a trained eye|can get in there for a look.
{43643}{43704}you have to learn to anticipate|your opportunities, okay?.
{43707}{43754}getting out of a cab,|wind from a subway grate...
{43757}{43855}or as you so sadly missed there,|bending over to pick something up.
{43858}{43927}these are situations which require|lightning reflexes.
{43930}{44010}- i tell you, i can do that.|- your a step slow right now, nick.
{44012}{44098}hey, no wonder.|i remember what it's like out there.
{44100}{44135}no interaction. no face time.
{44138}{44214}look at me. every day i have|the street, the subway, the atm line...
{44216}{44266}the office, the gym, the--
{44269}{44309}what have you got?.
{44311}{44373}young people sitting in cars in ohio.
{44375}{44423}wistful glances at the stoplight.
{44425}{44469}no, i go to school.|that's interaction.
{44471}{44510}okay. let's work with that.
{44512}{44569}the high school building|is four stories, if memory serves.
{44571}{44616}- it's five stories now.|- whatever.
{44619}{44696}it's multistory, and that means stairs,|which is good.
{44699}{44782}free yourself from the tyranny|of eye level. come here.
{44784}{44833}use the angles.|high for cleavage.
{44874}{44957}- low for the skirts.|- all right.
{44959}{45046}remember, there's no shame|in calling on an old standby, right?.
{45049}{45115}dropping of the pencil. tying of|the shoe.just don't telegraph it.
{45117}{45178}what about reflective surfaces?.|mirrors, windows?.
{45181}{45231}what, in school?.|no, there's no mirrors.
{45234}{45291}what about that ugly|glass trophy case that--
{45294}{45340}- yeah, that's there.|- well, use it. it's perfect.
{45343}{45422}go stand over there for a second.|keep going. keep going. stop.
{45455}{45535}ifyou can't stare directly,|turn your back and use the glass.
{45537}{45566}hi, gorgeous.
{45569}{45651}remember, angle of incidence|equals angle of reflectives.
{45654}{45739}in other words, ifyou can see them,|they can see you. so be alert.
{45742}{45795}- this is really complicated.|- it's rocket science.
{45798}{45859}- you were smart to ask for help.|- i have a good one.
{45862}{45903}when they're wearing short sleeves...
{45906}{45979}and they raise their arms to fix their|hair, you can see in that gap there.
{45982}{46060}now, see?. that shows me|you're using your faculties.
{46063}{46127}- don't they know we can see in there?.|- of course they do.
{46130}{46196}breasts are very sensitive.|they know when they're exposed to air.
{46239}{46325}are women gonna walk around with|their hands clamped to their sides?. no.
{46327}{46380}their hair has to be|dealt with eventually...
{46383}{46479}and it is our job,|it is ourvocation to be ready.
{46482}{46566}all right. so all this looking is fine,|but how do you take the next step?.
{46569}{46616}i need to meet someone.
{46722}{46771}ifyou can't see|how the two things are related...
{46774}{46815}there's nothing i can do foryou.
{46818}{46875}- wait. relax. come on.|- you think we are kidding around here?.
{46878}{46930}- do you think this is a joke?.|- no. why do you think i'm here?.
{46932}{47022}- you have got to make sex a presence...|- i'm sorry.
{47024}{47071}- in your mind, in your life...|- all right.
{47073}{47116}- in your spirit.|- i'm sorry.
{47217}{47300}- all right.|- what?. no. i don't smoke.
{47303}{47342}better learn.
{47419}{47488}- okay.|- come on.
{47697}{47744}here. wait here.
{48200}{48256}okay. stay on this side of me.
{48403}{48439}excuse us.
{48563}{48622}in, in, in.|go, go, go. hurry.
{48700}{48735}oh, yeah.
{48823}{48865}okay. we're in.
{48891}{48920}good.
{48923}{48999}so, first, a survey of the terrain.
{49125}{49174}technically, it's still happy hour.
{49199}{49278}your casual drinkers have yet|to pack it in. lots of groups.
{49280}{49356}not exactly ideal for our purposes,|but not impossible.
{49359}{49420}so, we need to make an impression.
{49423}{49506}send out a signal that back here|is the place to be.
{49508}{49565}all right. what do you do?.|what do you say?.
{49567}{49616}who cares?.|you're overcomplicating it.
{49619}{49686}you spend the whole night sitting here|thinking of the perfect line...
{49688}{49725}what good is that?.
{49727}{49847}just make contact. separate yourself|from the rabble. watch this.
{49932}{50003}hey! roses. rosebud.
{50043}{50085}hi. come here.
{50087}{50131}come here. come here. come here.

{50741}{50777}good question. nick?.
{50878}{50969}- because he's my uncle?.|- how awful foryou.
{51051}{51087}and so on.|no big deal, right?.

{51155}{51238}i'm gonna get us some drinks.|while i'm there, think of a hook.
{51261}{51347}- what?. a hook?.|- a hook. a line. an opening salvo.
{51350}{51444}any minute now, rosebud|is going to be standing right here...
{51447}{51507}iooking down at you,|and you're going to have one chance...
{51510}{51597}to either hit it out of the park|or strike out miserably.

{54418}{54461}i'm confident we can.
{54502}{54535}a thousand dollars?.
{54537}{54586}that's not exactly mind-blowing...

{54767}{54828}yeah. good job, nick.

{57538}{57595}so, the time. 70.
{57598}{57682}we've got nine hours|until closing time. an eternity.
{57702}{57752}look at me, nick,|and answer me this question.

{58041}{58087}- michael jordan?.|- michael jordan.
{58089}{58144}why was he the greatest?.|because he paced himself.

{58350}{58416}yeah. those guys think|they're kicking ass.
{58419}{58460}believe me, it is early.

{58518}{58567}- okay.|- you say you want it.
{58570}{58609}ifyou really wanted it...
{58632}{58718}you'd be in here, suffering the tortures|of the damned with those guys.

{58777}{58859}being horny and being willing|to put in the time night after night--
{58861}{58945}i want it. okay?. i go to high school.|you don't think that's torture?.
{58947}{58999}this is a lot of information.

{59086}{59138}how many boys your age|get an opportunity like this?.

{59235}{59322}i don't care what you do. be ready|to dive in at the moment of truth.
{59383}{59482}so... how often do you, like...
{59510}{59569}you know, like, get somebody|to go home with you?.
{59635}{59673}every night.
{59691}{59716}bullshit.
{59719}{59783}just because you're not having sex,|doesn't mean the rest of us...
{59786}{59829}are sitting around playing cribbage.
{59887}{59923}what's cribbage?.

{60462}{60509}how'd you get in here, nick?.
{60511}{60601}it's funny you should... ask me that.

{60727}{60754}neveryou mind.
{60756}{60818}i'm enjoying the air of intrigue|nick brings to our booth.
{60820}{60881}- cheers, everyone.|- i told sophie about your little bet.
{60883}{60919}she thinks you're full of it.
{60921}{60958}there's nothing little|about a thousand dollars.

{61026}{61087}- a woman.|- a woman?.
{61090}{61166}does it have to be a woman?.|what if some guy takes a shine to you?.
{61203}{61263}i guess that would count, 'cause we|never discussed what gender--
{61265}{61355}if nick is willing to exploit that|little loophole, he can have the money.
{61358}{61418}- what were you guys talking about?.|- i don't know.
{61421}{61515}- what were we talking about?.|- we were talking about women.
{61518}{61601}specifically, the pleasure to be derived|from admiring the female form.
{61642}{61702}imagine what it feels like|to be admired all day long.
{61704}{61771}- really.|- you'd rather be completely anonymous?.
{61774}{61818}- not completely anonymous.|- not anonymous.
{61820}{61893}i myselfwould welcome the sensation|of a hundred pair of eyes...
{61895}{61953}caressing my... booty|as i walk down the street.
{61955}{61990}guys always say that.
{61992}{62048}yeah. "we'd love it ifwomen|were always staring."
{62051}{62078}we would.
{62081}{62155}you would love it if no woman ever|listened to a word you were saying...
{62158}{62247}and just kept her eyes locked on|your chest oryour crotch?.
{62250}{62304}if it led to having sex all the time,|i would not mind.
{62307}{62381}you could deal with never being heard,|never being taken seriously?.
{62383}{62455}if i had something that needed saying,|i would wait until right after sex.
{62495}{62571}seriously, for a second,|just stop saying the obvious thing.
{62574}{62641}think what it would be like|if on every bus...
{62643}{62725}there were huge pictures|ofyour naked body.
{62727}{62802}- and on every billboard--|- magazine.
{62805}{62859}that's right--|it was just about your body.
{62862}{62958}there was so much time and money and|energy spent obsessing and analyzing...
{62961}{63037}trying to get a glimpse ofyour body,|that soon it felt like...
{63039}{63085}the world had forgotten|about everything else...
{63087}{63137}and you end up feeling...
{63139}{63204}disconnected from your own body,|like it's not even yours.
{63243}{63317}ifyou're really serious about|avoiding the male gaze--
{63319}{63402}- if the goal is anonymity--|- i never said the goal was anonymity.
{63405}{63446}here's a little suggestion, okay?.
{63449}{63502}putting on makeup.|styling your hair.
{63505}{63602}wearing a killer outfit and coming to|a place like this on a friday night.
{63604}{63679}that's when it gets interesting,|because at a certain point...
{63682}{63749}- you start internalizing the male gaze.|- not the best course of action.
{63751}{63813}male gaze. madison avenue.|fucking patriarchy.
{63815}{63861}whatever it is,|it's done its number on you.
{63863}{63943}do you thinkyou have any control|over who you find attractive?.
{63946}{64010}- of course we do.|- i think not, and i'll prove it to you.
{64013}{64140}ask any woman, "what's the single most|attractive quality a man can possess?'
{64143}{64201}- and what do they invariably answer?.|- sense of humor.
{64203}{64263}- sense of humor.|- sense of humor is huge. definitely.
{64265}{64372}and yet, if two lean, mean,|play-by-their-own-rules...
{64375}{64482}motorcycle-riding men|strolled up to this booth...
{64484}{64578}and beat the shit out of us|two humorous guys, right...
{64598}{64657}and asked you out for a ride,|you would be weak at the knees.
{64659}{64715}- no way.|- weak at the knees.
{64718}{64781}well, actually, guys who ride cycles|are pretty sexy.
{64783}{64834}- thank you. you see?.|- sorry.
{64837}{64938}the fact is that touchy-feely, weepy,|in-touch-with-their-feelings guys...
{64941}{64987}make you sick--|you're repulsed by them.
{64990}{65053}give me the ice age, okay?.|survival of the fittest.
{65055}{65141}no mixed signals. no bullshit.
{65143}{65221}just the meanest, hairiest bastard|wins all the time.
{65223}{65267}let's change the subject right now.
{65269}{65383}you know, it's interesting.|all this looking is so masculine.
{65386}{65451}i mean, you guys|are just about the visuals.
{65454}{65519}really. why is it that when|i'm going down on a guy--
{65522}{65588}- sophie!|- no, really.
{65591}{65647}why is it|that when i'm doing my thing...
{65649}{65695}why is it that men|always insist on watching?.
{65697}{65767}why can't you just close your eyes|and concentrate on the feeling?.
{65770}{65822}it's not the most flattering activity|for a woman.
{65825}{65890}i'm not sure that that's a--|maybe we can help.
{65893}{65984}nick, jump in here.|a woman is doing her thing.
{66015}{66062}why do we have to watch?.
{66145}{66216}well, maybe to make sure|that it's actually happening?.
{66243}{66302}i'll buy that.|make sure we're not hallucinating.
{66304}{66393}and maybe to file it away, in case|it's a long time before the next one.
{66395}{66478}two excellent answers. perhaps you'd|elaborate on the filing it away part?.
{66481}{66517}file it away for what?.
{66563}{66622}- oh. i don't know.|- come on, nick.
{66625}{66684}we're finally treading on|some familiar territory here.
{66687}{66767}mom's in the kitchen|making jell-o with fruit.
{66770}{66821}- you lockyourself in the bathroom--|- don't sweat it, nick.
{66823}{66869}i grew up with three brothers.
{66871}{66939}the closets were pornography museums.|more visuals.
{66959}{67007}you're right about the visual thing.
{67009}{67055}it always drives me nuts|when i hear a guy...
{67057}{67127}going on about something a girl does|that's supposed to be so sexy.
{67129}{67211}- like what kind of thing?.|- like how she flips her hair.
{67214}{67269}how she stands with one foot|to the side. it could be anything.
{67271}{67329}- what's wrong with that?.|- because that's nothing.
{67331}{67376}that's just something she does.
{67379}{67451}and she probably only does it|because she saw it in a movie.
{67454}{67502}it's not their real stuff.
{67505}{67580}all that stuff-- the hair flips,|the mannerisms, the catch phrases.
{67583}{67672}they add up to the personality.|so they are what's real.
{67675}{67755}yeah, but it's all the outside stuff.|that's fine in the beginning.
{67757}{67798}you need the outside stuff.
{67801}{67847}you need, like,|the reasons to be in love.
{67849}{67895}but you can get past that|to the part...
{67897}{67936}where the little tricks|don't mean anything.
{67939}{68013}i say you are attracted to|what is in front ofyou. end of story.
{68015}{68045}how romantic.
{68083}{68136}it takes years and years together.
{68139}{68178}- yeah?.|- i can't describe it exactly...
{68180}{68232}but it's like there's nothing|she can do.
{68235}{68304}all her usual ways of hooking you in|have no effect...
{68307}{68354}and yet you're still in love.
{68357}{68403}it's like the act is over...
{68405}{68451}and you get to the part|she's been hiding.
{68454}{68545}and she's been hiding it|because she thinks that's the part...
{68547}{68627}that's gonna blow it|or make you leave or get bored...
{68629}{68714}but you get to that part,|and you're still there.
{68739}{68800}and you're even more in love.
{68914}{68943}wow.
{68946}{69023}have you met my nephew?.|his name is jesus.
{69026}{69069}how old are you, nick?.
{69071}{69103}i'm 1 6.
{69105}{69190}stay strong, sophie. there's|a thousand of my dollars at stake here.
{69192}{69255}are we still on a one-drink limit?.
{69258}{69330}- i think we can have one more.|- yeah, i'm in.
{69333}{69386}great.|scootch out of there, sophie.
{69389}{69438}- who wants what?.|- sophie knows what i like.
{69441}{69503}- just some ice water, please.|- okay, that's charming.
{69506}{69533}nick?.
{69535}{69629}a player might consider taking advantage|of this time alone with andrea.
{69631}{69696}andrea. yeah.|you can take your time.
{69937}{69984}- hi.|- hey.
{70022}{70074}- what's the deal with your uncle?.|- i don't know.
{70077}{70155}this is really the first time|i've hung out with him socially.
{70176}{70250}- do you live in the city?.|- i live in ohio with my mom.
{70273}{70320}she and roger|don't really speak anymore.
{70340}{70370}ohio?.
{70395}{70446}do you have a girlfriend back home?.
{70473}{70520}no. not right now.
{70729}{70817}nick, can you do me a favor?.
{70819}{70855}okay.
{71103}{71145}pick that up.
{71225}{71288}- protein for stamina.|- let's switch, andrea.
{71291}{71353}- okay. i suppose it's your turn.|- yeah, good idea.
{71355}{71457}keep things fresh|and help us fight that second-round lag.
{71459}{71521}- what's that?.|- that's a conversational lag...
{71523}{71603}that often occurs after the ordering|of the second round.
{71606}{71694}actually, nick was telling me about you|and your relationship with his mother.
{71697}{71785}- no secret there. she's my sister.|- your relationship with her.
{71787}{71860}not your relationship to her.|nick says they don't speak.
{71863}{71937}that's terrible.|i mean, you need your family.
{71939}{72016}- yeah.|- what do you think happened, nick?.
{72041}{72119}my mom's a lot older than roger.|like nine years.
{72122}{72176}you must have been quite|the little surprise, roger.
{72179}{72243}a nine-year gap doesn't necessarily mean|an unplanned pregnancy.
{72282}{72351}but, apparently, i did come|as a bit of a surprise.
{72353}{72400}really?. i didn't know that.
{72403}{72460}that doesn't explain why you|and your sister don't get along.
{72463}{72527}let's just say|we don't have much in common.
{72546}{72628}my mom says that when roger was little,|he could talk himself out of anything.
{72631}{72682}he never got in trouble,|even when he got caught.
{72684}{72787}- she called him "roger dodger."|- that's perfect foryou.
{72789}{72868}there's nothing wrong with a high|verbal ability. nick's got it too.
{72871}{72922}i wanna be like granddad.|he almost never talks.
{72924}{72985}but when he does,|everyone kind of leans forward.
{72987}{73035}you know, my dad's like that.
{73037}{73100}the difference being that what|my father has to say is usually...
{73103}{73151}some variation on,|"get me another scotch."
{73154}{73208}- like father, like son?.|- no, like daughter.
{73211}{73250}- i get my--|- whose daughter?.
{73252}{73313}- what do you mean, "like daughter?'|- no joke.
{73315}{73400}mom keeps a bottle in the|laundry basket. she has foryears.
{73451}{73487}- oh, god, nick.|- that's awful.
{73490}{73578}she's not a wreck or anything.|she's just-- what do you call it?.
{73581}{73627}- high-functioning.|- yeah. that's susan all right.
{73630}{73677}she's always functioned|at a high level.
{73679}{73770}- she's just really high, you know?.|- how can you joke about that?.
{73772}{73833}you can joke about anything|that has to do with yourself.
{73835}{73883}it's a basic human right.|isn't that right, nick?.
{73915}{73979}i think that's constitutional|or something.
{73982}{74061}freedom of speech.|freedom to joke.
{74063}{74118}you know what?.|i need the ladies' room.
{74120}{74176}let's let the boys discuss|these new revelations.
{74179}{74216}- good idea.|- i don't-- all right.
{74219}{74254}all right.
{74308}{74355}be careful.|we'll be waiting.
{74399}{74444}are you sure you want|to get laid tonight?.
{74447}{74486}i thought you would|like to know that.
{74488}{74534}i am not the one|who is here to learn.
{74536}{74582}for most of us,|this is a forgetting place.
{74584}{74628}- all right?.|- we were talking about granddad.
{74631}{74676}- i figured--|- you felt qualified to jump in...
{74679}{74724}and expound|on that particular topic?.
{74727}{74760}that's right. i'm sorry.
{74763}{74836}you're an expert on that subject now.|you guys are joined at the fucking hip.
{74839}{74884}i wanted to keep|the conversation going.
{74887}{74941}there are four of us|in this booth.
{74943}{74993}think of it|as a game of bridge.
{75043}{75122}in bridge, you have|two sets of partners, okay?.
{75124}{75170}ifyou hope to become|the kind of man...
{75172}{75218}that other men|choose to go into battle with...
{75220}{75277}you have to learn|to read your partner.
{75279}{75351}it should have been obvious i don't want|to talk about the family tonight.
{75375}{75405}a little while ago...
{75407}{75475}we were listening to sophie|describe herself giving a blow job.
{75478}{75523}don't you think that's|slightly more fertile ground...
{75526}{75589}than what's at the bottom|ofyour mother's laundry basket?.
{75635}{75702}pull your weight and steer|the conversation back...
{75704}{75762}to something|in the same universe as sex.
{75764}{75847}remember, the thing that was supposed|to be the primary focus this evening?.
{75850}{75890}don't make me resort|to the fail-safe.
{75936}{76003}- where are you going?.|- excuse me.
{76006}{76054}no. bad idea.
{76056}{76090}ah,jesus.
{76811}{76862}everything okay over there?.
{76864}{76910}no. i can't go|with you standing there.
{76912}{76982}- why not?.|- i just can't. get out of here.
{76984}{77049}can't go through life|with a shy bladder, nick.
{77051}{77099}you're gonna be spending|a lot of time in bars.
{77101}{77148}most of them will have restrooms|just like this one.
{77181}{77236}fine. then you go.|you go first.
{77239}{77310}i don't have to.|just came in to rinse my hands.
{77351}{77385}forget it.
{77495}{77561}- let's go, kid.|- no, look. i'm with somebody.
{77589}{77647}uncle roger, could you|please tell him?. he doesn't--
{77650}{77707}- how you doing?.|- no, i don't know him.
{77709}{77755}- bedtime, kid. let's go.|- uncle roger.
{77757}{77804}- come on, kid. out.|- could you please--
{77825}{77892}he's my-- uncle roger!|really, go back in there.
{77931}{77975}look, i'm an actor.|i'm researching a role.
{77978}{78025}- good luck with that.|- okay.
{78752}{78791}- you okay?.|- oh, hey.
{78794}{78865}i guess i should've waited|to use the bathroom.
{78867}{78956}okay. unless the novelty of hanging out|with prom king here has worn off...
{78959}{79022}i suggest we get a bottle|and find someplace with a view.
{79115}{79194}- all right. let's find a view.|- let's find a view. ladies.
{79667}{79722}- that was close.|- that's good. thank you.
{79725}{79779}- this is the finest.|- that's good.just a little bit.
{79782}{79809}thankyou.
{79811}{79874}just a little. that's good.|that's good.
{79922}{79965}- how do you like the wine?.|- i like it.
{79967}{80015}it makes my chest feel warm.
{80018}{80080}- roger, you're a bad influence.|- yes, i am.
{80083}{80140}- alcohol, women of loose morals.|- and gambling.
{80143}{80178}that's right. gambling.
{80180}{80233}i don't see nick complaining.
{80235}{80291}although i have to say,|forwomen ofloose morals...
{80316}{80390}conversation has been|pretty tame so far tonight.
{80414}{80495}with the notable exception|of sophie's oral presentation.
{80497}{80523}shut up.
{80526}{80616}it'd be helpful for nick to hear more of|the female perspective of the sex act.
{80619}{80667}- do you agree?.|- god.
{80686}{80726}where to begin?.
{80728}{80775}nick will get us started. nick?.
{80882}{80917}go ahead.
{80934}{80979}ask away.|any question you like.
{80982}{81010}keep it interesting.
{81013}{81044}all right.
{81118}{81176}i guess i'd like to know|what your first time was like.
{81201}{81259}- that's what you come up with?.|- that is a great question.
{81261}{81292}thankyou.
{81323}{81359}i'll go first.
{81437}{81513}- it was my junioryear.|- high school or college?.
{81546}{81583}high school.
{81586}{81652}his name was bobby rushton,|and we weren't even dating.
{81655}{81738}i just picked him out one day|and decided he was gonna be the one.
{81741}{81796}- why did you pick him?.|- sense of humor?.
{81821}{81891}ha-ha. he was funny,|as i remember, but...
{81893}{81960}it was something more than that.
{81963}{82042}it was like this vibe.
{82044}{82091}i knew he would be nice.
{82094}{82180}he wasn't very popular, and i didn't|think he'd brag about me to his friends.
{82183}{82248}- that's half the fun.|- well, he didn't.
{82251}{82298}he was just as nervous as i was.
{82327}{82377}which is part of the reason|that i picked him...
{82379}{82456}because i think|i wanted to have some control.
{82459}{82530}- you know?.|- you were his first as well then?.
{82532}{82608}yeah. in fact, i went with him|to go get the condoms.
{82611}{82659}we biked all the way across town...
{82662}{82722}because we were so afraid|someone might see us.
{82724}{82783}- we planned the thing for a month.|- i love this story.
{82803}{82885}- yes.|- so, where did you, you know?.
{82925}{82986}it was in my house,|in my room.
{83006}{83053}my parents were away|for the weekend.
{83055}{83143}- did you bleed?.|- the usual. not too bad.
{83146}{83193}wait. so it hurts the first time?.
{83236}{83292}well, it really hurts...
{83329}{83376}that first second.
{83404}{83471}and then after that,|it's just new.
{83474}{83571}you know?. it's like this|new feeling foryour body.
{83574}{83608}so how was he?.
{83638}{83710}- matter of seconds?.|- no way! he kept going like a champ.
{83713}{83766}i had to ask him|to hurry up, actually.
{83768}{83799}- ow!|- yeah.
{83802}{83903}he did admit to masturbating like crazy|beforehand so he wouldn't just--
{83906}{83983}- like he wasn't doing that already.|- no, he sounds like a nice guy.
{83986}{84040}- he sounds like a dream come true.|- he was a nice guy.
{84043}{84101}he's a cop now.|he's got four kids.
{84103}{84162}early sex|is an absolute humiliation.
{84164}{84259}oh. speak foryourself.|my first time was wonderful.
{84262}{84302}oh, yeah?.
{84305}{84352}let me take a wild guess.
{84381}{84434}- an older gentleman.|- right you are.
{84436}{84471}- married?.|- right again.
{84500}{84535}how old were you?.
{84537}{84595}i was 1 9.|freshman in college.
{84597}{84664}guess you didn't spend a lot of time|getting to know your roommates.
{84667}{84759}no. no, i don't even remember|what they look like.
{84786}{84829}so what happened?.
{84861}{84953}well, believe it or not,|he ended up staying with his wife.
{84979}{85017}what are the odds?.
{85019}{85067}what did you do when you realized|he wasn't going to leave her?.
{85069}{85146}well, nick,|i got over it eventually...
{85149}{85196}and vowed|not to repeat the mistake.
{85199}{85271}- and how's that going?.|- some months are better than others.
{85274}{85308}- uh-huh.|- sophie--
{85311}{85364}- i didn't say anything.|- what can i do?. they're all married.
{85367}{85418}i promised i would not be a nag.|it's okay.
{85421}{85475}you, hotshot.|tell us about your first time.
{85548}{85639}actually, i think nick's story|is much more interesting. nick?.
{85663}{85719}- this i want to hear.|- yeah.
{85781}{85822}nicholas?.
{85825}{85900}well, this is hard to admit, but...

{97899}{97955}nick. do you know|where we are?.
{97986}{98050}- i thinkyou said greenwich street.|- we're in winning time.
{98053}{98109}- okay. winning time.|- right. okay?.
{98111}{98173}it's a little harder to recognize|than when you're in a bar...
{98175}{98223}but the concept is the same.
{98266}{98320}there's an incredible moment|that happens when a party...
{98323}{98395}passes its apex, its peak.
{98421}{98494}as if by magic,|suddenly every person in the room...
{98497}{98544}is acutely aware of the time.
{98547}{98622}it is at that moment|that the fear hits.
{98647}{98721}- what fear?.|- the fear of the empty apartment.
{98746}{98774}oh. yeah.
{98777}{98830}that is more|than most people can stand.
{98853}{98930}desperation creeps into the room|like a fog.
{98933}{99001}eyes begin|to search the crowd anxiously.
{99003}{99083}standards are drastically lowered.|i mean, it's palpable.
{99105}{99156}- you know what i'm saying?.|- not really.
{99234}{99317}what i'm saying is,|you have a real shot here, nick.
{99395}{99486}this is the moment|that separates a true champion.
{99488}{99539}you remember the reason|you first asked for my help?.
{99559}{99589}the primary goal?.
{99591}{99639}- yes.|- then let me help you...
{99641}{99684}to achieve it.
{99967}{100021}all right. so.
{100023}{100096}we need to scope out|who the drinkers are.
{100099}{100167}every party needs a pace car,|a rabbit.
{100192}{100267}always look for the girls who are|two drinks ahead of everybody else.
{100270}{100307}how do you do that?.
{100310}{100367}listen for inappropriately loud|bursts of laughter...
{100370}{100423}or scan the crowd|for somebody spilling a drink.
{100426}{100514}check the dance floor for somebody|working out of their zone.
{100517}{100564}how about them?.|they seem pretty drunk.
{100663}{100694}good afternoon.
{100731}{100825}god, this is so embarrassing.|i don't know how this happened.

{103950}{104022}and nick is at|his absolute peak sexually.
{104024}{104070}so, i figure,|the two ofyou go at it...

{107282}{107313}love you.
{107409}{107444}don't go.
{107767}{107802}oh, let me introduce you.
{107804}{107851}this is donovan lehman,|christopher weland...
{107854}{107895}our two collaborators.
{107898}{107943}i think they're gonna be|perfect foryou.
{107946}{108020}you told me you wanted something|a little bit magic, a bit surreal.
{108023}{108083}hey, hey, donovan.|how are you, man?.
{108086}{108142}- roger. hey, man.|- how are you?.

{113122}{113163}i think we got sidetracked there.
{113166}{113219}seriously, donovan, with all|the pressure facing men today...
{113222}{113270}it's got to be tough|to maintain a relationship.
{113273}{113319}i don't know.|let's ask a man. chris?.
{113321}{113369}traditional male roles|are being tossed aside...
{113371}{113434}before we have any chance to make|an internal shift, don't you think?.
{113437}{113522}our culture seems designed|to emasculate and infantilize.
{113547}{113598}- that's a strong statement.|- why don't you go and...
{113601}{113640}help yourself to some food?.
{113643}{113698}it's particularly true|in a situation when the woman is...
{113700}{113757}two decades older than the man.
{113780}{113836}- roger!|- approximately.
{113917}{113964}we were having|this discussion the other day--

{114133}{114183}you want me to leave|and go where?.
{114208}{114274}think very hard|about what you're doing.
