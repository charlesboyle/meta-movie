(woman) alan, every
ten-year-old is afraid
of something.
(alan) the kid's afraid
of tuna-fish sandwiches.
mercury levels
in the tuna.
whatever.
alan, the world is
a frightening place
to him right now.
i think we could be
a little more supportive.
supportive? i'm the most
supportive father on earth,
but i'm running out of
supportive things to do.
i signed him up
for little league,
he drove everybody crazy
with statistics about how you
can develop tumors from being
hit in the head with a ball.
did you know that shin splints
can lead to blood clots
in the legs?
claire, he brought in
a medical journal. nobody
wanted to play after that.
and now i'm building him
a tree house, in a tree
he refuses to climb.
you know he hates heights.
i don't know. i just
want to be a good father.
but you are
a good father.
(thunder rumbles)
(gasps) i'm ok! i'm ok!
(thunder crashes)
aah! no, i'm not!
hey, rich!
(laughs) well?
you like it?
uh, yeah, it's great, dad.
hey, how about bringing
me up that bag of nails?
no, come on up!
look. solid as a rock.
dad, 8% of all household
accidents involve ladders.
another 3% involve trees.
we're looking at
fine. just put the bag
in the bucket, ok?
(resumes hammering)
rich.
huh?
ow! (yells)
oh! oh!
dad! do you have feeling
in your toes?
yes, i have feeling
in my toes.
oh, alan, honey,
are you ok?
yeah, i'm fine.
fine. oh!
can't argue with
statistics, dad.
statistics. here's
something you can do:
go down to
gutman's hardware store,
buy a pound of these.
but, dad --
son, you can't
live your life
based on statistics.
you've gotta
take some chances.
now come on, buddy.
you can do this.
this is not good.
definitely not good.
(lights chirp)
(warning device beeps)

(gasps)
(squeaking)
(wind howling)
welcome to the library,
young man.
don't tell me. you're here
for a special book.
mister --
stop, stop, stop.
allow me to guess.
i have a talent for
guessing what people need.
you're in need of...
a fantasy.
brave knights,
mythical fairies,
ferocious dragons.
look, all i want is --
adventure!
of course. you're a boy
who loves adventure!
brimming with
wicked demons,
cutthroat pirates --
no, no, that's not it.
horror!
ah, horror! evil demons!
wretched monsters!
haunted houses!
graveyards!
yes.
it's horror for you, boy.
i'm sure of it.
your library card, please.
i don't have one.
you do now.
sign here.
richard tyler.
consider this your passport
to the wonderful,
quite unpredictable
world of books.
but i don't
want any books.
hmm?
that's what i'm
trying to tell you.
i only came in here
'cause of the storm.
you mean you don't need...
oh.
i see.
is there a phone where
i can call my parents?
through there.
proceed in a
northeasterly direction
until you get to the rotunda,
and from there head west
through the fiction section.
and you'll find it.
a public telephone.
you can't miss it.
(wind blows eerily)
don't be afraid, boy.
if you lose your way,
merely direct yourself
back to the exit sign.
(thunder)
(shoes squeak)
wow!
jeez!
(thunder)
whoa! oh!
hello?!
(voice echoing)
(swordplay)
(horse gallops/neighs)
uh-oh.
(falling droplets)

oh! uhh!
(yells)
(roars)
(yells)
uhh!
(yelling) help!
mister, mister,
where's the exit?!
(screams)
help!
(yells)
(gasps)
wha...? (gasps)
huh?
i'm... i'm a cartoon!
you... are an illustration.
who... who are you?
i am the pagemaster,
keeper of the books
and guardian of
the written word.
(gasps) you're the guy
from up there!
where are the others?
why, they're here, of course!
and all around.
maybe you can show me
the way out?
follow me.
i-is that the way?
oh, the only way.
fiction, a to z!
where all is possible!
where a boy's imagination
can take root and grow
to incredible heights!
(grunting)
where a boy's courage
is a wind that moves
him to discovery!
(men continue grunting)
and where
your journey begins!
uhh! whoa!
to find your way home,
you must face three tests:
horror, adventure
and fantasy.
and remember this:
when in doubt,
look to the books!
aah! how do you
stop this thing?!
(man #1) i am the ghost
of christmas past...
(man #2) all the pirates
shared a grave.
(crashing)
(phone off hook)
(moans)
(operator) due to the storm,
all lines have been
temporarily disconnected.
please try your
call again later.
(moaning) oh! ow!
(sighs) this is not good.
definitely not good at all.
(grunts)
(yells)
where's the son of a sea biscuit
knocked me from me crow's nest?
where's he be?! where's he be?
so here be the lubber who
knocked me on me poop deck
and with no apologies, too!
(growls)

the way out?
i know these waters like
the back of me hook!
(mutters)
uh... uh. this way.
i gotta get home.
my parents are probably
worried sick about me.
well, i'm afeard i've been
dry-docked in this library
far longer than
i'd like to remember.
as i sees it, you with
your library card are
me ticket out of here!

ooh, i'm naked.
uh, yeah, i guess so.

(grumpily) i'm fantasy. oh!
(clears throat)

hmm.

(clears throat)
now tell me,
what's the one thing
you wish for more than
anything in the world?
anything in the world?
i-i'd like to get out of here.
i'll grant your wish, child.
but you must do me one small
kindness in return.
you gotta check me
outta here!
that's it? ok, let's go!

or something?
(laughs) honey,

hmm.
(adventure yells)
oops! (laughs) i forgot.
my wand doesn't always work
outside the fantasy section.
you mean you can't
wish us to the exit?
(groans) that overdue shrew's
never even seen the exit.
more than you have, shorty!
in fact, the exit's just beyond
my fantasy section. hmph!
then what are ye doing
in these parts?
there a witches' convention
around here, maybe?
look, i was misshelved. (laughs)
but that's over, now that
young prince charming here
has come to check me out.
my good eye, he is.
the lad's checking me out!
come on, boy, we're
wasting time chumming off
this dinghy.
it's on to
the exit for us!
if he thinks the exit's in
that direction, you know
it's got to be in this one!
don't listen to her,
mate. she's not sailing
with a full crew!
ah-ah-ah! (sneezes)
fantasy!
she's a bloody nightmare.
let's leave him. he doesn't

just stay close to me and...
and you got nothing
to worry about.
(sarcastically) mm-hmm.
there it is! the exit! (pants)
(sighs)
looks like the only way
to reach the exit is
through that there house.
no way i'm going in there.
it's your only chance, boy.
it's just a house.
yeah, but 70%
of all accidents
are household-related.
dr. jekyll. mr. hyde.
must be a duplex.
whoa!
go ahead, matey. i'm...
i'm right behind ye.
(gasps)
well? ring the bell.
(pants)

(makes kissing sounds)
oh, i scared you.
i'm sorry!

by its cover.
look, he's smiling!
(laughing)
that's a smile?
all right, teatime's over.
let's start
navigating this house.
huh? no, wait!

it's scary inside!
ha! i ain't afeared of nothing!
i'm afraid.
of what?
of, of... (yells)
and... aah!
and... (makes creepy noise)
and... (imitates
woman screaming)
uh, i know how you feel.
horror always has sad endings.
i come from a world
of happy endings.

help us through the house.

i was trying to help them
find their way to
the other side of the house.
the other side?
my boy, i derive no pleasure
in telling you that
you are in extreme danger.
danger?
even as we speak.
lurking in this very room,
waiting to strike,
are forces of evil.
(gasps)
(screams) wait for me!
wait for me!
every man is possessed of
both good... and evil.
(suavely) oh, yes.

the pagemaster.

he's the guy who did
all this to me!

i was nearly torn apart
by a crazy doctor.
i was made a slave by
a bunch of mangy pirates
and eaten -- got that?
eaten by
a fire-breathing dragon.
he don't mean it,
my pagemaster.
he don't mean it.
not to mention being
tossed, squashed and scared
practically to death.
yet you stand before me.
well... yeah.
think, boy! what kind of
an adventure would you have had
if i brought you here
with a turn of a page?
(cackling)
(all gasp)
(laughing)
you prevailed over evil.
ah, you looked moby dick
in the eye, boy.
ah, you had pirates tough,
me lad, and don't no one
speak any different.
if i had brought you
here from the start,
you never would have
found the courage
to face your own fears.
(roars)
and in doing so,
you triumph here and always.
hey, is that... that's me!
that was you.
i'm ready to go home now.
(sighs)
i mean, we're ready.
the world awaits.
whoa!
godspeed to you, boy!

(pagemaster's voice)

young man.
huh?
are you all right?

you'll slip again!
hey, wait a minute!
wait a minute!

a talent for guessing
what people need.
just this once.

(claire) i can't imagine
where he could be.
maybe we should
call the police.
(gasps) alan!
he's home.
alan.

(owl hooting)
rich?
we probably should
put him in his bed.
let's let him sleep
up here tonight.

(horror) it's dark out here.
i wish there was a night-light.
(fantasy) honey,
