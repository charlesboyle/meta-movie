his parents didn't have

yeah, well, things ain't easy
at the moment, jay, you're right.
but there's a lot of people
worse off than what we are.
and just 'cause
things ain't easy...
that don't give you the excuse
to take what's not yours, does it?
that's stealing, right?
and we don't steal.
no matter what happens,
we don't steal.
not ever. you got me?
are you giving me your word?
yes.
go on.
i promise.
and i promise you...
we will never send you away.
[crying]
it's okay, kid.
you got a little scared.
i understand.
it's okay.
[people screaming]
[grunting]
[men chattering]
(joe)
jim, he's a very slow guy.
just plants himself there.
so you just keep him steady.
keep him trapped in the middle.
keep dancing around him, okay?
you know what to do.
you know this type.
that guy's a bum.
[sighing]
two bits will
get a guy a seat.
and that guy gets to watch
you bleed and call you a bum.
and i know i gotta take it from
him, 'cause he's a paying customer.
i see.
well, well, well.
pardon me, miss. allow
me to restate my position.
mr. abraham feldman
is a novice fighter...
whose ass you should
gently kick...
until it is humped up
between his shoulder blades.
that is, if it doesn't offend
your overly sensitive nature.
god knows.
[moans]
now, you see, that break's
still a few weeks away.
i know.
yeah.
and you were gonna tell me
about this when?
it's gonna be fine. it's
not fine. no, it's not.
what the hell?
you don't tell me?

i can't get any shifts.
we ain't got any cash.

<i>(announcer)
and here comes braddock</i>
<i>with his long-time manager,
joe gould. </i>
(man)
you're washed up, braddock.
<i>(announcer)
and now for our main event. </i>
(joe)
hey, which one's us, pal?
<i>jersey veteran
james j. braddock... </i>
<i>is up against hymie caplin's
latest charge... </i>
<i>young abe feldman
from schenectady, new york. </i>
(joe)
six rounder.
<i>(announcer) some might recall
that braddock was once... </i>
<i>a light heavyweight
title challenger. </i>
<i>his golden-boy peak ended
when tommy loughran... </i>
<i>handled jim over 15 rounds
back in '29.</i>
<i>since then,
the oft-injured braddock... </i>
<i>has shown only a glimmer
of his early promise. </i>
<i>and the losses have started
to pile up. </i>
<i>but braddock continues
to battle. </i>
<i>and here comes
the popular abe feldman. </i>
<i>feldman looks to be
the real thing... </i>
<i>and showed some real moxie in his recent win
over hans birkie. </i>
[people screaming]
hey, who whipped latzo?
i did.
goddamn right.
who ko'ed slattery
in the ninth...
when everybody said he didn't
have a rainmaker's chance in hell?
that'd have to be me, too.
right.
and we're supposed to pucker our
assholes over this abe feldman?
the guy couldn't break wind.
no.
hey, jimmy.
anyplace else you'd rather be?
no.
good.
now, what are you
gonna do about it?
<i>(announcer) here we are halfway
through the fifth</i>
<i>[men screaming]
and it's more of the same. </i>
<i>the boys clinch again. </i>
break it up.
(joe) he's crushing my guy. get him off!
[crowd booing]
break!
<i>(announcer) the boo-birds
have started flying here. </i>
<i>they want action
from these fighters. </i>
<i>feldman sticks a left
in braddock's face. </i>
<i>braddock's right hand
is his best and only weapon. </i>
<i>he'll show the left, but it lacks snap
and feldman knows it. </i>
come on, give these yokels
a shot in the ass!
<i>feldman ducks a haymaker
but fails to follow up. </i>
[booing]
[men chattering]
<i>(announcer) and another big right
by braddock. </i>
<i>now, there's the braddock
we all recall. </i>
<i>but it's one at a time.
it may not be enough. </i>
come on!
[men screaming]
[bell ringing]
<i>(announcer) the referee pulls
the boys apart. </i>
<i>and there's the bell
to end the fifth. </i>
(joe)
easy now. easy.
i saw that.
you bust it again?
i'm calling it, jim.
you gonna use the left?
okay, good.
you get in there but you
don't let him crowd you.
you work his belly, you
hammer his belly with the left.
last round. come on,
you got to show me something.
give me a good one. you're
giving me an ulcer, harry!
shut up.
work his belly with the left.
you got it?
give him the flapdoodle with
the right because he don't know.
right?
'cause he's kind of stupid.
okay? last round.
last round! go get him!
(joe)
the left!
[crowd screaming]
damn it, i wish he could find
his goddamn left.
(joe)
that's it! change it up!
southpaw, that's it!
<i>(announcer) feldman prancing around,
looking for an opening... </i>
<i>but still few clean punches
by the fighters. </i>
<i>braddock still pawing away
with the left. </i>
<i>another ineffectual left
from feldman. </i>
<i>braddock can hardly lift his arms.
he's slow on his feet. </i>
<i>at least gould in his corner
is still throwing punches... </i>
<i>trying to urge his man on. </i>
[crowd screaming]
[yelling]
go home!
[crowd booing]
(man)
go home, braddock!
no holding, braddock!
<i>(announcer) cavanaugh's working harder
than the fighters. </i>
dry up!
<i>(announcer)
another clinch. </i>
<i>it's as if 80 tough fights have finally jumped
on braddock's back. </i>
you're a bum!
that's it!
<i>cavanaugh pulls them apart,
and he's called the fight. </i>
<i>he's called the fight. </i>
<i>it's a "no contest. "</i>
<i>and the popcorn and the peanuts
are raining down. </i>
<i>and i'm afraid to say that's all these
fighters deserve... </i>
<i>for the show
they put on tonight. </i>
[crowd booing]
<i>i'm telling you, it's sad to see
a fighter that was once... </i>
<i>the caliber of james braddock
reduced to this. </i>
it's all right, jimmy.
an embarrassment,
that's what it was.
an embarrassment!
where the hell's the purse?
you wouldn't have
to be asking that...
if you gave a shit
about your fighter.
okay. he's fighting hurt.
maybe you got a bunch of fat
and happy fighters at home...
can afford to rest a month between
bouts. i don't know. lucky you!
christ, he hardly gets
a punch in anymore!
fights being stopped by
referees? he's pathetic!
(johnston) fights like
that keep people away.
we're revoking his license,
joe.
whatever braddock was gonna do
in boxing, i guess he's done it.
wait a minute.
that's all.
[whispering]
oh, boy.
mr. johnston!
(johnston)
jim.
what's going on?
you didn't tell him?
yeah, of course i told him.
he wanted to
hear it from you.
come on, mr. johnston,
no contest?
i broke my hand.
okay? it's legit.
you don't see me
crying about it.
i don't see what you got
to complain about.
i still went out there, i still put
on a show. i did what i could do.
you know, we did that
boondock circuit for you...
me and joe. remember?
i didn't quit on you.
and i didn't quit tonight.
i didn't always lose.
i won't always lose again.
i can still fight.
go home.
i can still fight. go home
to mae and the kids, jim.
go home? go home with what?
go home with what? a broken
hand from mount vernon?
mr. johnston!
[door opening]
baby?
what happened?
i didn't get the dough.
they didn't pay up.
they called it a "no contest,"
said the fight was an embarrassment.
they decommissioned me.
jimmy,
what happened to your hand?
it's broke again
in three places.
(braddock)
they said i'm through, mae.
they said
i can't be a boxer no more.
mercy.
okay.
jimmy, if you can't work...
we're not gonna be able to pay
the electric, or the heat.
and we're out of credit
at the grocery.
so i think we need
to pack the kids.
they could stay at my sister's
for a little while...
and i'll take in more sewing.
that way we could make
two, three breadlines a day.
i'll get doubles, triples,
whatever i can find.
jimmy, you can't work.
mae, i can still work.
jimmy, you can't work.
your hand's broken.
they see me
lugging this around,
you're right,
they won't pick me.
not down the docks,
not anywhere.
so we're gonna cover it up...
with the shoe polish.
okay?
i'm sorry.
no.
no.
[sighing]
no.
(jake)
i need five and only five!
come on, jake!
[men screaming]
one.
two.
three.
four.
five. that's it!
[ship's horn blowing]
[men chattering]
(mike) what the hell
happened to your face?
i got in a fight.
yeah?
what'd you go do that for?
that's a good question.
mike wilson.
jim braddock.
i used to follow a pretty good
fighter with that name.
and there's some other guy
going around using that name now.
can't fight for shit.
gambling man will lose
a lot of money on him. twice.
[braddock moaning]
(mike)
that hand ain't gonna work.
you can't slow me down.
i need this job.
i need the job, too.
[whistle blowing]
what's wrong with
the goddamn hand?
[panting]
you see us
falling behind, jake?
he's all right.
appreciate it.
i'll get a cold beer.
just a water for me, quincy.
all i got today
are big spenders.
beer for him, too. i'm buying.
don't hurt my feelings.
it's been a while, but... you
don't have to twist my arm.
(mike) yeah, i used to be a
broker. still lost it all in '29.
yeah, me, too.
i had just about everything
i ever earned in stocks.
even had a little
taxi company.
i mean, who loses their dough
on cabs in new york city, right?
well, i thought that one
was gold for the grandkiddies.
you know, there's people living
in shacks in central park.
call it the hooverville.
this government's
dropped us flat.
we need to organize, you know?
unionize. fight back.
fight? fight what?
bad luck? greed? drought?
no point punching things
you can't see.
no, we'll work
a way through this.
fdr, he's gonna handle it.
screw fdr.
fdr, hoover,
they're all the same.
you know, i come home one day.
i stand in my living room.
and between the mortgage and the
market and the goddamn lawyer...
that was supposed
to be working for me...
it stopped being mine.
it all stopped being mine.
fdr ain't given me
my house back yet.
mama, why can't i
go to school?
is it because i'm a girl?
(mae) maybe. hadn't thought of that.
who's that man
at our house?
(mae)
excuse me!
can i help you?
i'm sorry, lady,
you're past due.
[panting]
no, you can't.
you can't.
there's kids.
(electrician) if i
don't, they let me go.
they already let two guys go.
please.
this apartment, it's what we got
left that keeps us hanging on.
lady, i got kids, too.
$6.74.
how much to turn it back on?
four months. $44.12.
if i work 26 hours out of
every 24, it still won't add up.
we ain't got nothing.
nothing left to sell.
all the guys
you could've married, huh?
yeah.
what happened to those guys?
[sighing]
[howard coughing]
it's howard.
since this afternoon.
"bless us, o lord...
"and these thy gifts which
we are about to receive...
from thy bounty. "
i'm all prayed out.
(jay)
here's more firewood.
[grunting]
(woman) where are you going?
i said where are you going?
go to hell,
you no-good bastard!
go on, then!
we don't need you!
all right. help me,
pick up some of that wood.
(rosemarie) i got it, mama.
all right, let's go, sweetheart.
all right, honey.
(mae)
nice and warm, huh?
baby?
baby?
look at mommy.
[whimpering]
sweetheart.
[coughs]
[howard shivering]
(jay)
mommy?
what's wrong?
nothing, sweetheart.
mommy will be right back,
okay?
[sobbing]
[footsteps approaching]
[panting]
howard's fever was getting worse
and then rosy started to sneeze.
where are they, mae? jim,
we can't even keep 'em warm.
where are the kids?
the boys will sleep on the
sofa at my father's in brooklyn.
and rosy'll stay
at my sister's.
jimmy, we can't keep 'em!
you don't make decisions
about our children without me.
what if they get really sick?
we already owe dr. mcdonald...
if you send them away, then
all this has been for nothing!
it's just until we get back...
what else was it for?
if we can't stay together,
that means we lost!
that means we've given up!
i am not giving up!
i'm trying to protect our
children. mae, i promised him.
outside the butcher's.
i looked him in the eyes...
and i promised him
with all of my heart...
i would never ever
send him away.
you can't do this.
you weren't here.
you can't break my promise.
jim, you didn't see.
you weren't here.
(mae)
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry, jimmy.
what are you doing?
jim?
jimmy! where you going?
where you going, jimmy?
(clerk) that doesn't qualify you,
sir. what else can you tell me?
(man) the problem is my wife
is losing all of her teeth.
i got a relief order
for her.
the doctor says
it's due to insufficient diet.
she's still nursing the baby
on account of...
we can't afford milk
for the family.
(clerk)
okay.
i never thought
i'd see you here, jim.
[woman chattering]
[men chattering]
(promoter)
he jumped up...
kicked his stool
out of the ring...
and he was just,
he was furious.
i grabbed the mike...
there's jimmy braddock.
the thing is,
i can't afford to...
i can't afford
to pay the heat.
i've had to
farm out my kids.
you know, they keep cutting
shifts down at the docks...
and you just don't get picked
every day.
i sold everything i've got
that anybody would buy.
i went on public assistance. i
signed on at the relief office.
they gave me $19.
i need another $18.38...
so i can pay the bill
and get the kids back.
you know me well enough to know
if i had anywhere else to go...
i wouldn't be here.
if you could help me through this
time, i sure would be grateful.
sure, jim. sure.
good luck.
(promoter #1)
jim.
(promoter #2)
hey, jimmy.
(promoter #3)
here you go, jim.
good luck, jim.
i'm sorry, joe, i didn't...
i'm sorry.
what in the hell do you have
to be sorry about?
jesus christ, jimmy.
how short are you?
about $1.50.
okay.
(jay) we're home! hooray, we're home!
(rosemarie)
we're glad to be home!

[howard laughing]
(mae)

howard, don't jump on
the bed. sorry, mama.

good girl. you got a
better jab than your dad.
[chuckling]
boy, you are a brave man. not
really. mae's at the store.
that's a good one, kiddo!
you want to go play with the other
kids while i talk to uncle joe?
joe gould,
still looking dapper, i see.
certainly. gotta keep up
appearances, right?
good to see you, jimmy.
nice to see you, joe.
nice day, huh?
yeah.
you drove all the way out here
to talk about the weather?
maybe i was in the neighborhood.
did you ever think of that?
little fresh air.
joe, this is jersey.
yeah. good point.
[both laughing]
i got you a fight.
go to hell. come on.
you want it, don't you?
what, we gonna bring this up with
the boxing commission, or not?
yes, and they'll sanction it.
this one fight, and one fight only.
it's not a comeback, right?
it's just one fight.
why?
'cause of who you're fighting.
how much?
just once, ask me who
it is you're fighting.
how much?
$250.
you're on at the big show
at the garden, tomorrow night.
you fight corn griffin, jimmy.
number two heavyweight
contender in the world.
prelim before
the championship bout.
you know, joe, this
ain't funny. no, it's not.
and it ain't no favor,
either.
griffin's opponent got cut,
and he couldn't fight.
so they had to find somebody they
could throw in at a day's notice.
nobody legit would...
nobody would take a fight
with griffin without training.
so i told them use the angle
griffin's gonna knock out a guy...
never been knocked out.
you're meat, jimmy.
are you on the level, joe?
come on. always.
for $250,
i would fight your wife.
now you're dreaming.
and your grandmother.
at the same time.
teeth in or teeth out?
take them out.
then you're dead.
you're down, you're gone.
no chance.
$250?
[people chattering]
(vendor)
get your programs here!
programs here! 25 cents!
i mean, for christ's sake,
you never been knocked out.
who the hell goes
and sells his gear?
how soon they forget!
i'm so sorry.
borrowed gear, borrowed robe.
knock yourself out.
[chuckling]
joe.
i might as well get an aooga horn
and chase him around the ring.
that's good.
you been drinking?
are you trying to
hurt my feelings?
you're just too loose. you're
spooking me. sharpen up.
come on, joe, we both
know what this is, right?
i get to put a little more distance
between my kids and the street...
and i get to say good-bye
at the garden.
full house,
night of a big fight.
thank you very much.
right. come on, hurry up.
let's get the lead
out of here.
what the hell was that?
they ran out of soup
on the line this morning.

seven men, and seven only!
one. two. three.
four. five.
thanks.
(jake)
braddock!
listened in last night.
was that really you?
yeah.
didn't think
i'd be seeing you back here.
it came up at the last minute,
you know?
it was a one-fight deal.
the purse was $250.
my end of that was a little less
than half. it was, like, $123.
we owed $118.
left me with $5.
makes you a rich man, huh?
around here.
good fight.
thanks.
dock seven.
seven.
hey, jim.
hey, mike.
good fight.
thanks.
i wouldn't have hit sara.
i know, mike.
i couldn't live with myself
if i'd have hit her.
just get so angry
with all this shit.
you know, if you were gonna
win, you could've told me.
if i knew i was gonna win,
i would've bet on myself.
why can't you ever listen
to me? i don't know.
<i>(man on radio) ...to determine whether
the strikers were willing...</i>
<i>to submit to
an arbitration situation. </i>
<i>tension pervaded the new york
waterfront yesterday. </i>
(mae) why don't you go play
with the boys, sweetheart?
be careful.
hey, rosy.
hi, daddy!
[kids chattering]
you know,
joe gould was just here.
yeah, i saw.
you did?
he thinks the commission
might be willing to...
reverse their ruling.
he thinks he can get me
another fight.
he wants me to stop working
and get back in shape.
i thought it was
just the one fight.
well, yeah.
he fronted us $175
so i can train.
you know what that is
right there?
that's a second chance.
that's what that is.
it's not that
i'm not grateful...
or proud, honey.
i'm so proud of you.
but we got off easy
when you broke that hand.
we're back to even now.
right. and nine months from
now, we're back in the same boat.
baby, please.
we just don't have anything
left to risk.
mae.
there's still some juice in these
legs, and i can still take a few.
baby, please.
just let me take them
in the ring.
at least i know
who's hitting me.
i'm gonna go
and tell the kids.
jay! guess what.
what?
i got another fight!
who with?
i don't know, but he's
going down. hey, howard.
jesus.
joe, open the door.
(mae)
joe! open the damn door!
don't hide in your fancy
apartment. i want to talk to you.
you are not gonna make my husband
your punching bag all over again.
we are just getting by, and
you're taking him from his work...
like some bloodsucking
little leech!
and i will not let you get
him hurt again like that...
do you hear me?
i will not let you!
guess you better come in.
(joe)
how is it?
too sweet per usual.
really? go figure.
(joe) yours? nice, thanks.
sorry about that.
you just don't want folks
to see you down is all.
i didn't know.
i mean, i thought that...
yeah, no. that's the idea.
always keep your hands up.
[clears throat]
sold the last of it
two days ago.
so jimmy could train.
why?
sometimes you have
an instinct, mae.
you see something
in a fighter.
you don't even know if it's real,
you're looking for it so bad.
can't have no hope at all.
but this is crazy.
i mean, you don't even know
if you can get him a fight.
i'll get him a fight.
believe me, if it's the last
thing i do, i'll get him a fight.
honey. go get us some
of those crackers, would you?
she looks good
wearing the pants.
can you ever stop yours?
when he sets his mind
to a thing?
i wish i could.
see, i never know
who it's harder on...
them or us.
we have to wait for them
to fix everything.
and every day...
they feel like
they're failing us.
and really, it's just the
world that's failed, you know?
[sighing]
this is a lovely apartment. thank you.
(johnston) now, what am i
gonna go and do that for?
you saw the papers.
<i>news had to print extra
copies the day after braddock's fight.</i>
people are sentimental, you
know. some people are sentimental.
yeah, so tell me why i care.
you're still sore over the way
braddock took down griffin, fine.
i can understand that. it was a
heartbreak for a lot of people.
yes. but look.
you got guys fighting
an elimination series...
over who gets a shot at max baer
for the championship in june.
john henry lewis,
he's your number two in line.
now, he already defeated
braddock once in frisco, correct?
say you put braddock back
in the game against lewis.
lewis wins, you get your
revenge on braddock...
and your boy has gotten
a topflight tune-up...
with full publicity before
lasky, and what happens?
you make more money.
now, say on the other hand, by
some minute, infinitesimal chance...
god forbid,
braddock beats lewis.
now you got a sentimental
favorite go up...
and lose against lasky,
and what happens?
you'll make more money.
james, either way...
you're a richer man with braddock
back in the ring than if he's not.
come on, don't be foolish. we
both know the name of this game.
and it sure as hell
ain't "pugilism. "
they ought to put your mouth
in a circus.
what do you say?
don't chase him.
go around, cut him off.
time! (joe) james!
i got you a fight.
yeah?
you're gonna fight
john henry lewis again.
yeah!
joey! i could kiss you!
no, please,
not in front of the fellas.
isn't john henry
one of johnston's boys?
you let me worry about that,
please.
now i know why you won't kiss me.
you're all puckered out already.
brother, you have no idea.
lewis?
kicked our ass in frisco.
yeah. hey, mike.
who's "our ass" up there?
joe gould, mike wilson.
mike wilson, joe gould.
hi.
that guy ain't been beat
in ten fights.
but you win on a long shot, and
that's a great payday for me.
that's great.
i'll keep that in mind, mike!
you got more important things
to think about. come here.
now, i ain't gonna
bullshit you, all right?
now, you win one,
i can get you another.
win again and then things maybe
start getting serious around here.
jimmy?
win.
[grunting]
(jeanette)
look good.
leverage.
(jeanette)
that's it, james!
be a bully, james!
aggression, that's it.
thanks.
i know this isn't
what you wanted...
but i can't win
without you behind me.
i'm always behind you.
thank you, baby.
i got a great idea.
you want to come along?
come on, just this one time.
all right. okay.
okay, i'll make that
a rain check then.
[sighing]
<i>lewis, still moving well here
in the fourth. </i>
<i>he dances in and out
before braddock can react. </i>
[crowd cheering]
don't let him
set the pace, jimmy!
[grunting]
there you go.
<i>braddock slides to his right,
tries cutting down the ring. </i>
john, get off the ropes.
move out of there.
<i>(bond) lewis spins his way
off the ropes... </i>
<i>[bell rings] and looks to resume control
at the bell!</i>
there we go. suck it up.
deep breath.
deep breath, deep.
all right. that ain't bad. he's
even faster than i remember.
yeah. he's fast. big deal.
you're not so bad yourself.
what are you doing? you
beat this guy easy last time.
he ain't the same guy.
you got to use your speed.
keep that jab in his face
and keep sliding to his right.
you see that.
keep him in front of you.
cut him off, all right?
and let go with the punches.
hit him! he ain't gonna like it.
i guarantee you, the more
you hit this bastard...
the slower he's gonna get.
he's an old man. he's too
slow. he can't keep up with you.
come on. use that jab.
how's that cut?
he's all right.
knock the legs out
from under him.
trap him in the corner,
and really work him.
(joe) do not fight this fight his way.
you make him fight
this fight your way!
let's go. you got him.

why isn't he sitting down?
pay attention.
yeah, now he's gonna wonder:
"if braddock is such an old
man, why is he still standing?
why is he still
coming at me?"
you're stronger than this guy.

<i>frank essex, daily news. </i>
you got a lot of reporters
here today.
a lot of people are interested
in this fight.
what do you got to say
to your fans today, jimmy?
i guess i'm grateful
for the opportunity.
i know that these days not
everybody gets a second chance.
you know, i have a lot
to be grateful for.
you know, i have three beautiful,
healthy, troublemaking kids.
[reporters laughing]
you know, i have the prettiest
wife a man could wish for...
<i>bob johnson, boston globe. </i>
two days ago, we ran a story about
you giving your relief money back.
can you tell our readers why?
i believe we live
in a great country.
a country that's great enough
to help a man financially...
when he's in trouble.
but lately i have had some good
fortune and i'm back in the black.
and i just thought
i should return it.
(pete)
wilson, you're up.
yeah, over here.
listen, what's the first thing
you're gonna do...
if you make world champion?
first thing, i'm gonna have
to go and buy some turtles.
(reporters)
what's that? turtles?
yeah, well,
i said to the kids when...
i was leaving the house
this morning...
that i was gonna
bring back the title...
and they thought
i said "turtle. "
[all laughing]
yeah.
so naturally,
i don't want to let them down.
but if i could bring home
the title and a turtle...
they sure would be tickled.
you got that?
"title, turtle," right?
<i>jake greenblatt
from chicago trib. </i>
hello, jake. (greenblatt)
it's been a while.
what's changed, jimmy?
i mean, you couldn't win a
fight for love or money, right?
how do you explain
your comeback?
(braddock) well, you
know, the truth is, jake...
for a number of years there
we was fighting injured.
i broke my hand
more than once.
i got in a car accident one
time, we was on the road...
and i had to get that fixed.
i had a run of bad luck.
and, this time around,
i know what i'm fighting for.
yeah? what's that, jimmy?
milk.
(greenblatt)
milk?
<i>sporty lewis,
new york herald. </i>
sporty.
actually, my question's
for mrs. braddock.
mrs. braddock, my readers
would love to know...
how do you feel
about the fact that...
max baer's killed two men
in the ring?
so how do you feel
about that, ma'am?
are you scared
for your husband's life?
she's scared for max baer, is
who she's scared for, mr. lewis.
(joe) okay, how about
one more question, folks?
[reporters screaming]
said downstairs you wanted
to see us.
joe, jim, come on in.
have a seat.
right here.
editorial says
this fight is good as murder.
and everybody associated with
it should be hauled into court...
and prosecuted afterwards.
they say the paper's getting
all sorts of letters...
from people saying
you're their inspiration.
like you saved their lives
or something.
if you ask me,
it's a lot of crap.
but if i'm gonna
promote this fight...
i'm not getting hung out to
dry if something happens to you.
you're all heart.
my heart's for my family, joe.
my brains and my balls
are for business...
and this is business.
you got me?
gotcha.
you will know exactly
what you're up against.
and my attorney,
mr. mills...
will witness that i've done
everything in my power to warn you.
you know,
i seen the carnera fight.
carnera's height saved him.
he was knocked down 12 times.
exactly. would've been worse
if he was shorter.
baer had to punch up to hit
him. took a little something off.
[projector whirring]
(johnston)
that's frankie campbell.
stand-up fighter,
knows how to take a punch.
his style familiar, jim?
like looking in a mirror, huh?
hey, he don't need to see this.
he'll see it
or i'll call off the fight.
[johnston exclaiming]
(johnston)
you see that combination?
campbell didn't go down
on the first punch.
he was a tough guy.
second one killed him
on the spot.
just cut it off, will you?
the autopsy said that his
brain was knocked loose...
from the connecting tissue.
(joe) consider your
ass fully covered, okay?
run it again.
[projector whirring]
[sighing]
remember ernie schaaf?
(johnston) nice guy. you
lost one to him in '31.
ernie took one of those
on the chin from baer.
he was dead
and didn't know it.
next fight, first little nothing
jab put him to sleep forever.
detached brain, they said.
joe?
no snappy comeback?
it ain't my skull the guy's
gonna try and stove in.
you want to think about it?
you think
you're telling me something?
what, like, boxing's
dangerous, something like that?
you don't think triple shifts or
working nights on the scaffolds...
is just as likely
to get a guy killed?
how many guys died the other
night living in cardboard shacks...
trying to save on rent money?
guys who were trying to feed their
family. 'cause men like you...
have not yet quite figured out
a way to make money...
out of watching that guy die.
in my profession,
and it's my profession...
i'm a little more fortunate.
[scoffs]
all righty then. you guys
have dinner here tonight.
take your wives. it's on me.
we'll snap some pics
on your way out.
if you change your
mind tomorrow...
at least we got some
good press out of it.
(joe)
good. come on.
[people chattering]
it's gorgeous!
jimmy, can we get silver
faucets? of course.
(braddock) how many you
want? a dozen? right.
listen. a little bird told me
to check the evening edition.
so let's see what we got.
"boxer jim braddock
has come back from the dead...
to change the face of courage
in our nation. "
oh, that's nice.
yeah.
sporty lewis wrote that.
sporty lewis?
yeah. and get this.
"in a land that's
downtrodden...
"braddock's comeback is
giving hope to every american.
"people who were ready
to throw in the towel...
"are finding inspiration in
their new hero, jim braddock.
"as damon runyon
has already written...
he's truly
the cinderella man. "
cinderella man?
yeah.
oh, i like it. it's kind of
girly. yeah, kind of. yeah.
oh, brother.
yeah, this is gonna be fun.
excuse me.
jim.
i'm not quite finished yet.
beg your pardon, sir.
(braddock)
thank you.
you know what?
i got the bill here. yeah.
johnston. he's a big spender.
he's gonna leave a big, big tip.
(lucille) yeah. he's a real peach.
gotta love the guy.
right, sweetie?
look at this.
this is me?
i know it is.
jimmy.
(joe)
oh, boy.
you think johnston set that
up? oh, yeah. i think. maybe.

from the gentleman
who just arrived.
<i>mr. baer said
to wish you bon voyage. </i>
don't open it. put it in a
bag. we'll take it with us.
hey, joey?
yeah?
get the coats.
jim.
well,
if it ain't cinderella man.
thanks for the champagne,
mr. baer.
you're doing a great job publicizing
the fight. i really appreciate it.
i hope it's gonna be a very
successful night for both of us.
you keep telling people you're
gonna kill me in the ring.
i got three kids at home.
you're upsetting my family,
particularly my wife.
listen, braddock.
i'm asking you sincerely
not to take this fight.
now, you seem like a decent
fellow. people admire you.
i really don't
want to hurt you.
[snickers]
it's no joke, pal.
people die in fairy tales
all the time.
(man #1)
hey, max, how about a picture?
(man #2)
hey, jim! how about a shot?
there you go. take it easy. just smile.
one more!
yeah. i think the smart thing
would be for you to take a fall.
circus act's over, old man.
[baer laughing]
right here, max.
there you go.
i think i'll go a few rounds
with the dancing baer.
yeah, there you go.
come on, jim.
very good. okay.
come on.
okay.
hey, we'll see you in the
ring. how about that, champ?
come on. let's go, jim.
max, my wife, mae.
you ought to talk to him, mae.
you are far too pretty
to be a widow.
that's not nice, max.
not nice. come on.
on second thought, maybe i can
comfort you after he's gone.
hey, i said shut your
goddamn mouth, you punk!
[all gasping]
sorry.
send me the cleaning bill.
get that, boys?
now he's got his wife
doing his fighting for him.
yeah. ain't she something?
[all laughing]
all right. get me a drink.
[braddock grunting]
(braddock) all right.
three-punch combo, okay?
pop, pop, bang. come on.
yeah.
oh, that's good.
one more time.
keep your thumbs tucked in.
keep your elbows in.
all right.
that's enough, now.
there's some sting in that.
that's enough, please.
(braddock)
good. yeah, that's good. bang!
(howard) i want a turn, dad. all right.
hey, where's your defense?
come on, get your hand up.
i want a turn.
[metallic clanking]
(braddock) left, right,
left. pop, pop, bang.
[kids laughing]
come on, howie.
all right, that's enough!
no boxing in the house!
no boxing out of the house.
all right?
no boxing. period!
you're gonna stay in school.
then you're gonna go
to college...
and you're gonna have
professions.
because you're not gonna have
your skulls smashed in, too!
do you understand me?
is that clear?
hey, why don't you boys go and
get ready for bed, all right?
[crying]
i used to pray...
for you to get hurt
just enough...
so you couldn't fight anymore.
and when they took your license
away, even scared as i was...
i went to the church
and i thanked god for it.
'cause i always knew...
a day might come
when it could kill you.
i just knew it, jimmy.
and now it's here.
you just got the jitters,
that's all.
he's killed two men, jimmy!
what's worth it?
i have to believe i got some
kind of say over our lives. okay?
you know, that if things are
bad, that we can change them...
we can make things better
for our family.
but i need you to be safe...
nothing's safe anymore, mae.
... so much.
and without that...
i need you to be safe!
... nothing's safe at all.
all right.
i have stood by for all of it.
until now.
not for this, jimmy.
i just can't.
so you train all you want.
make a show of it
for yourself, for the papers.
but you find a way
out of that fight.
break your hand again
if you have to.
[coughing]
(man)
is he all right?
so, how's he doing?
he's old. he's arthritic.
and his ribs haven't been
right since the lasky fight.
what's the bad news,
sunshine?
joe!
what?
the reporters are here.
jesus.
right. get rid of that
goddamn rib protector.
jimmy!
press is here, boy-o!

in that ring!

that jim's fighting for them.
[joe whistling]
[sighing]
hey.

john henry lewis?
that braddock guy.

art lasky punk?
james j. braddock.
correct again.
now, refresh me
on this one.
who was it took that corn griffin
and turned him inside out...
with no questions asked?
who was that?
i used to think it was me...
but now i'm kinda thinking
it was you.
no, don't you
sell yourself short.
at some stage, you think maybe
you're gonna do some taping here?
why not?
all right, let's see.
how's that?
[knocking on door]
what?
excuse me, ma'am.
you can't win
without me behind you.
that's what i've been trying
to tell you.
maybe i understand some.
about having to fight.
so you just remember
who you are.
you're the
bulldog of bergen...
and the pride of new jersey.
you're everybody's hope.
and you're your kids' hero.
and you are
the champion of my heart...
james j. braddock.

places like this...
and you don't want to get tangled
up with that kind of crowd.
nice girl like you.
yeah, okay.

i'll see you at home?
see you at home, baby.

<i>james j. braddock,

<i>(braddock) we understand max baer

<i>the table's been set.

yeah? your clock's
about ticked out, asshole.
i'm here to enforce them.
i want clean breaks.
tell laughing boy here,
no backhanding.
i don't want any backhanding
and hitting on the breakaway.
no low blows!
i'll take care of this, joe.
you understand? you tell this
bohunk no grabbing, no manhandling.
watch your goddamn language,
you nasty little shit.
look at this! no low
blows means no low blows.
you gonna let this little
prick talk to me like that?
no hitting on the
breaks. (joe) it talks!
holy mackerel, it talks!
look at that!
keep your hands up at all
times to protect yourselves.
now, touch gloves
and come out fighting.
good luck. go to your corners.
i'm gonna kick his mick balls
up to the roof of his mouth.
that ought to be
a familiar taste for him, huh?
come on, jimmy boy!
(joe) yeah, boys, get some
pictures here! come on!
you can do this.
this guy is made for you.

that's it!
take it right to him, jimmy!
now, now.
<i>baer snaps braddock's head
back with two right uppercuts. </i>
<i>it's always a question of which max will show up
in the first round... </i>
<i>the killer or the clown?</i>
<i>maxie doing well. </i>
<i>it looks like he's enjoying himself,
mugging for the crowd. </i>
(joe)
take it into him!
<i>a big flurry by braddock!
a vicious right to the head!</i>
take it easy, pal. i'll let
it go a couple of rounds.
<i>madcap maxie is heavily favored to put
the long snore on braddock... </i>
<i>in the first round. </i>
<i>that big right hand of his
has dynamite in it... </i>
<i>especially when he traps
his man on the ropes. </i>
he's gonna carry him
for a couple of rounds.
[both grunting]
(referee)
braddock! break it up!
[bell rings]
break it up, i said!
go on, jimmy!
<i>(bond) jim survived the round and
looked pretty good doing it. </i>
<i>braddock will not be bullied.
not tonight. </i>
when he does this horseshit,
knock it off.
he's trying to thumb you.
all right?
and then slip inside of there
and shorten up the punches.
all right? shorten them up.
that's your turf!
(joe)
inside is yours!
(man #1)
good job, braddock!
(man #2)
come on, braddock!
<i>well, no one expected braddock
to go past the first round. </i>
shorten them up.
stay inside of him.
<i>the experts at ringside
were wrong again. </i>
<i>shorten them up! (bond)
there's the bell!</i>
<i>and here we are
in the second round. </i>
(joe)
that had some salt on it!
<i>braddock lands a hard right
to the head. </i>
<i>max swats him away
with cool contempt!</i>
<i>he appears to be
toying with braddock. </i>
<i>there's no other word for it. </i>
<i>max struts around the ring
without a care in the world. </i>
(joe) sharp, efficient,
tough, and short! good.
[crowd screaming]
knock that on out.
<i>(bond on radio) and max responds with
swinging rights and lefts. </i>
<i>all power punches from maxie. </i>
break him!
<i>and braddock punches
right to the head!</i>
cover up!
is that the right spot, jimmy?
[bell rings] all right. break it up!

[crowd whistling]
[groaning]
how are those ribs?
okay. all right. take it easy.
(jeanette) good pace. good pace,

you're looking great
out there, jimmy.
yeah.

hey, jim?
if he goes for your body...
drop the elbows on him.
teach him a lesson.
break his goddamn hand.
<i>(bond)
that round was tough to score. </i>
<i>braddock landed several surprising
right hands. </i>
<i>and those thunderous
body punches by the champ... </i>
<i>should pay dividends
in the later rounds. </i>
<i>in the fifth,
baer's smile is gone. </i>
(joe)
yeah, that's it!
<i>jimmy comes in
with a hard right... </i>
<i>then neatly slides off
to baer's left. </i>
<i>avoiding the counterpunch,
jimmy sticks a jab. </i>
<i>and now the crowd is jeering and even laughing
at the champ. </i>
<i>and maxie's none too pleased. </i>
(referee)
all right, break it.
break!
<i>[crowd booing] baer backhands braddock
across the face!</i>

<i>(bond) max salutes the crowd.

<i>braddock keeps punching. they hammer each other,
