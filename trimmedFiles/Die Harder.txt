false alarm! hold it!
it's o.k.! i'm here.
here we are!
it's all right.

yeah, sure,
at the impound.
next time,
read the sign.
hey, you don't
understand.
look, i'm just here
to meet my wife's plane.
you got to let me
have this car.
yeah, sure, tomorrow,
you pay 40 bucks,
we give it back.
don't write it up.
don't write it up.
come on, man. this is
my mother-in-law's car.
she's already mad at me
'cause i'm not a dentist.
look, i'm a cop--
l.a.p.d.
oh, i was in l.a. once.
hated it.
well, i can understand.
i don't like it
much myself--hey!
that's a plastic fender up there!
take it easy!
cut me some slack,
will you?
look, i used to be
a cop in new york city.
i only moved to l.a.
because my wife took a job there.
come on.
what do you say?
here we are--
washington, d.c.,
the heart of democracy.
one hand
washes the other.
come on, man.
it's christmas.
so ask santa claus
to give you another car.
merry christmas, pal.
it's all yours, murray.
son of a bitch.

[children singing

yeah, i know that,
larry.
<i>snow flurries along</i>
<i>the northeastern seaboard...</i>
hi. where are
the telephones?
right over there.
thank you very much.
<i>thank you. leonard adkins</i>
<i>is in a warmer clime</i>
<i>with a story that grows</i>
<i>hotter by the minute.</i>
<i>security was tight today</i>
<i>at escalan airport</i>
<i>in the republic</i>
<i>of valverde</i>
<i>where government</i>
<i>authorities report</i>
<i>that deposed general</i>
<i>ramon esperanza</i>
<i>will be delivered</i>
<i>for immediate extradition</i>
<i>to the united states.</i>
<i>only two years ago,</i>
<i>general esperanza</i>
<i>led his country's army</i>
<i>in a campaign against</i>
<i>communist insurgents,</i>
<i>a campaign fought with</i>
<i>american money and advisers.</i>
<i>esperanza's fall from power</i>
<i>caused ripples</i>
<i>not only in his country's</i>
<i>recent election,</i>
<i>but closer to home,</i>
<i>as well,</i>
<i>when high-ranking</i>
<i>pentagon officials were charged</i>
<i>with supplying him with weapons</i>
<i>despite the congressional ban.</i>
<i>but mounting evidence</i>
<i>that esperanza's forces</i>
<i>violated the neutrality</i>
<i>of neighboring countries</i>
<i>made congress</i>
<i>withhold funds,</i>
<i>funds which esperanza</i>
<i>is accused of replacing</i>
<i>by going into</i>
<i>the lucrative business</i>
<i>of cocaine smuggling.</i>
[beeping]
<i>although esperanza was removed</i>
<i>as commander in chief</i>
<i>earlier this year,</i>
<i>the agreement to extradite him</i>
<i>was only reached yesterday,</i>
<i>and washington</i>
<i>insiders say</i>
<i>it was a phone call</i>
<i>that made it happen,</i>
<i>a phone call</i>
<i>from a--</i>
[beeper]
all right, all right.
if i could find a phone,
i'd call you,
whoever you are.
bye.
excuse me.
thank you.
yeah, this is
lieutenant mcclane.
somebody there
just beep me?
i'd like to think
i'm somebody.
honey,
where are you?
did you land yet?
it's the nineties,
remember?
microchips, microwaves,
faxes, airphones.
yeah, well, as far
as i'm concerned,
progress peaked
with frozen pizza.
listen, um,
we're going to be
about half an hour
late landing, o.k.?
i just wanted
to let you know.
the kids o.k.?
yeah, well, they're about
to lose their minds
from all the sugar
your parents are giving them.
did mom give you
a hard time
about borrowing
her new car?
no. not yet.
listen, honey,
when you land,
can we just, like,
you know, rent a car,
check into a hotel,
leave the kids
with your parents,
order some room service?
a bottle of champagne,
what do you say?
you're on, lieutenant.
i'll see you in about
a half an hour, honey.
i love you. bye.
isn't technology
wonderful?
my husband
doesn't think so.
well, i do.
i used to carry around
those awful mace things.
now...
i zap any bastard
that screws with me.
i tried it
on my little dog.
poor thing
limped for a week.
heh.
excuse me.
well, you look really
familiar to me.
i get that a lot.
i've been on tv.
yeah. me, too.
grab the tools,
will you?
you got it.
<i>this is amy nichole</i>
<i>reporting live</i>
<i>from escalan airport</i>
<i>where deposed general</i>
<i>ramon esperanza</i>
<i>has just arrived</i>
<i>under heavy guard.</i>
<i>strangely, the deposed</i>
<i>dictator's mood seems jubilant.</i>
<i>he is smiling and waving</i>
<i>to the crowd</i>
<i>like a man</i>
<i>running for political office.</i>
<i>...thousands of political</i>
<i>prisoners in the past decade,</i>
<i>including</i>
<i>the new president,</i>
<i>and there's no doubt</i>
<i>that he still has</i>
<i>some ardent supporters</i>
<i>both here and abroad.</i>
<i>rumors abound on capitol hill</i>
<i>that there were other...</i>
yeah?
sorry to
bother you, sir.
we're checking
our equipment.
any problems with
the conduit line?
gee, i don't know
anything about that.
would you mind
if we take a look?
help yourself.
it just don't seem
right somehow--
closing down
this church.
the parish is going to
keep on using it,
but it won't
be the same.
been here
a lot of years,
and i've been
right here with it.
yeah, i kind of
feel like
a piece of me is dying
along with this church.
well, you're right
about that.
<i>...cocaine smuggling,</i>
<i>racketeering, and bribing</i>
<i>government officials.</i>
<i>he certainly</i>
<i>doesn't show it,</i>
<i>but no matter</i>
<i>how high his spirits,</i>
<i>they can't hide the fact</i>
<i>that america's</i>
<i>war on drugs</i>
<i>has finally taken</i>
<i>its first prisoner.</i>
this is buckwheat.
the clubhouse is open.
<i>here at dulles, the quiet men</i>
<i>from the justice department</i>
<i>wait to handcuff the man</i>
<i>who has come to symbolize</i>
<i>the enemy in america's</i>
<i>fight against cocaine.</i>
<i>that battle may be</i>
<i>almost won,</i>
<i>but the war</i>
<i>is still in doubt.</i>
<i>samantha coleman, wntw,</i>
<i>for night-time news.</i>
roger that,
colonel. out.
[beep]
that was the colonel.
everyone's in position.
how's the weather?
we got flurries all along
the virginia coast.
new storm front coming in
from the northeast.
heh heh.
god loves
the infantry.
amen.
carry out
your assignments.
check.
later.
adios.
hey, it's cold
out there, man!
i stomped my feet
for five minutes.
yeah, yeah.
two cappuccinos.
make it fast.
scotch straight up,
please.
excuse me, officers.
this may sound like
a wild-goose chase,
but i think
i just saw--
saw what?
elvis. elvis presley.
fuckin' tourists.
ought to be a law.
excuse me. there's
a large number of you
from the justice department
here this evening.
is there any particular
reason for that?
just routine.
just routine?
yes.
any comment, sir?
not now.
thank you, sir.
thanks.
hey, that's
colonel stuart over there.
got a little problem
with personnel.
last-minute replacement.
how's the security
around this place?
like we figured--
a joke.
colonel stuart, could we have
a few words, please?
you can have two--
''fuck'' and ''you.''
no pictures,
you pinko bitch.
old news.
oh!
damn it!
excuse me.
hey, man.
what is it?
you got a key
for this door?
yeah. why?
because i want you to
open it up, that's why.
is there a cop on duty
around here?
the airport police.
go get them.
ha ha ha!
hand me the wrench.
going to work
overtime.
good idea.
o.k., hold that end.
watch it, man.
all right.
perfect. perfect.
good to go.
hey!
it's a restricted area.
what's the matter?
couldn't wait
for the skycap?
we work here.
let's see some i.d.
ha ha.
sure. no problem.
oh,jeez. fuck!
hiyah!
what is this--
a tag team?
aah!
aah!
- aah!
- aah!
you say he came in here
and flashed a badge?
yeah. he said to bring
you guys back here.
uh! ah!
aah! aah!
aah! aah!
oh!
christ.
[glass breaks]
[bicycle bell rings]
fucker!
freeze!
nice guess, asshole.
i'm a cop.
that was
the bad guy.
where's your i.d.?
on its way
to cleveland?
no, you did not
explain anything.
all you did was
shove me back here
into this
cattle car.
sir, you were told
when you boarded
that we were
overbooked.
fine. done.
i accept that.
but why can't i get
the first-class meal?
my network paid for it.
do you know who i am?
yes. we've all
seen your program.
your episode
'' flying junkyards''
was a very objective look
at air traffic safety.
it wasn't nearly
as edifying
as '' bimbos ofthe sky,''
was it, connie?
you think
you're funny.
you think you're funny.
fine.
i've got
your number.
and i've got yours.
so park it, sir.
fine.
stewardess.
mr. thornberg,
you cannot
monopolize my time.
you cannot put me
near that woman.
excuse me?
he means he's filed
a restraining order
against me.
i'm not allowed
within 50 feet of him.
so by keeping me
in this section,
you are violating
a court order.
i can sue you
and this airline.
that woman assaulted me,
and she humiliated me
in public.
what did you do?
knocked out
two of his teeth.
would you like
some champagne?
sorry, officer mcclane.
i had to check.
here's your piece
and shield back.
thanks.
over here, officer!
we understand that
there was a shooting.
the presence ofjustice
department officials...
jesus!
hey, come on.
just a word, o.k.?
what the fuck
are you people--
what are you
doing here, man?
this is a crime scene.
you got to seal
this area off.
that's
up to the captain.
maybe you better take me
up to the captain,
then, huh?
where's cochrane?
he didn't make it.
you're late.
we ran into trouble,
colonel.
some cop...
killed cochrane.
i barely got away,
sir.
did you accomplish
your mission?
yes, sir, but...
cochrane, sir.
well, then
the damage is minimal.
the penalty
could be severe.
you fail me again,
and the chamber
won't be empty.
dismissed.
miss. miss.
i can't find my dog.
miss. my dog.
one minute, ma'am.
i want you
to fill out this form.
[knock on door]
who is it?
come in.
captain lorenzo?
yeah.
i'm john mcclane--
yeah, yeah.
i know who you are.
you're the asshole
that just broke seven faa
and five district
of columbia regulations
running around
my airport
with a gun,
shooting at people.
what do you call
that shit?
self-defense.
well, what, you think
that l.a. badge
is going to get you
a free lunch or something
around here?
well...maybe a little
professional courtesy.
huh! in an airport
on christmas week?
you've got to be
kidding.
o.k. fuck courtesy.
how about just
being professional?
your boys just walked away
from a crime scene, captain.
you can't wrap this thing
up in 1 0 minutes.
you got to
seal the area off,
take pictures,
dust for prints.
hey, don't
lecture me, hotshot.
i know
what i'm doing.
we're going
to dust it down.
we'll take all the pictures.
we'll sweep for fibers.
when are you
going to do this?
after 300 or 400
people go through?
you'd be lucky
to get a print
from one
of your own people.
just shut down
that area and--
oh,just
shut the area down.
it's that simple, huh?
just shut the area down?
yeah, and i got everybody
from the shriners'
convention
to goddamn boy scouts
traipsing through here!
i got lost kids,
lost dogs--
not now! later!
i got international
diplomats.
i got a fuckin' reindeer
flying in here
from the fuckin'
petting zoo!
butjohn mcclane,
he's got a little problem.
hell, let's shut down
the whole fuckin' airport!
what do you think
they're going to say upstairs
when i tell them that?
pick up the phone
and find out.
i don't need
fuckin' forensics
to tell me
all this was
was some punk
stealing luggage!
luggage? that punk
pulled a glock 7 on me.
you know what that is?
it's a porcelain gun
made in germany.
it doesn't show up
on your airport x-ray machines
and costs more than
you make in a month.
you'd be surprised
what i make in a month.
if it's more than $1 .98,
i'd be very surprised.
hey, mcclane,
don't start believing
your own press, huh?
yeah, yeah,
i know all about you
and that nakatomi thing
in l.a.,
but just because the tv
thinks you're hot shit,
that don't make it so.
look, you are
in my little pond now,
and i am the big fish
that runs it.
so you capped
some lowlife.
fine.
i'll send your
fuckin' captain in l.a.
a fuckin' commendation!
in the meantime,
get the hell out of my office
before i have you
thrown out of my goddamn airport!
hey, carmine, let me
ask you something.
what sets off the metal
detectors first--
the lead in your ass or
the shit in your brains?
fat fuck.
any i.d. on this guy?
that's somebody else's
problem.
your car's ready.
sign right here.
i need to borrow
this and this.
i'll bring it
right back.
hey! yo!
hold up!
yo!
hold up, boys.
hold up. hold up.
we got to check
something.
what are you doing?
pretty gruesome
fuckin'job.
all the confusion
in there,
forgot to get
this clown's prints.
ew! christ.
hey, you're supposed
to do that at the morgue.
not anymore.
got a new s.o.p.
for doas from the faa.
ha ha! i don't think
this one's going to make it, boys.
thanks a lot.
[speaking spanish]
ahh.
[ring]
powell here.
take that twinkie
out of your mouth
and grab a pencil,
will ya?
ha ha! hey,john,
how are you doing?
holly stood me up
a day,
and i'm here alone
in d.c.
with my in-laws.
eh, the old in-laws, huh?
they do love their
policemen son-in-laws.
listen, al,
what is the fax machine
telephone number
there at the station?
uh...
all right?
i want to send you
something.
excuse me.
[al] you and faxes?
this is a first.
yeah, well,
holly told me
i should wake up
and smell the nineties.
this way?
no. that way.
wait.
it's upside down.
it doesn't matter.
o.k. here it comes.
i'm sending you
something right now.
hold on a second,
cowboy.
[beep]
fingerprints?
we've got an unidentified
stiff here.
i've circled
the whirls in pen
in case the transmission's
a little fuzzy.
listen, run it
through state and federal,
and if you can,
run it through interpol.
will do.
well, what's this about?
oh,just a feeling
i have.
ouch. when you get
those feelings,
insurance companies
start to go bankrupt.
listen, the, uh,
fax number is...
is on the top edge
of the transmission...
is on the top edge
of the transmission
you just got.
oh, an airport, huh?
listen, you're not pissing
in somebody's pool, are you?
ha ha. yeah.
and i'm fresh
out of chlorine.
just as this storm
starts breaking,
the satellite will feed up
and drop the other shoe.
look at this new front
moving in.
makes its baby brother
look like chicken shit.
well, i can sand down
all the runways
and keep the plows going
between landings,
but you got to
downshift them up there,
give me time to work.
you got it.
all right, everyone.
let's call all our birds
and slow them down
before we get a parking lot
over our heads.
the line starts
at the mississippi,
and they better start
taking numbers.
can i get you another?
no, thank you.
i only have to
look at his face
for another 1 5
or 20 minutes.
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is the captain speaking.</i>
i've just been informed
by dulles traffic control
that there's a weather front
moving in ahead of us.
we may be up here
a little while longer.
thank you.
on second
thought...
[ring]
al?
hey, i'm right here,
partner.
your stiff's dossier is
coming through right now.
what can you
tell me about him?
he's dead.
you needed a computer
to figure that one out?
no, no. you don't
follow me.
according to
the department of defense,
he's been dead
for two years.
what?
that's right. sergeant
oswald cochrane.
american adviser
in honduras.
killed in a helicopter
accident 5-1 1 -88.
officer.
read between the lines,
and i'd say it looks
like a lot of black-bag
stuff to me.
yeah, i see it.
all right, al.
thanks a lot.
hey, anytime.
o.k.
say, i close
in about an hour.
maybe we can go
get a drink?
just the fax, ma'am.
just the fax.
hey, wait a second.
wait. i see somebody.
i'll call you back.
the ghost
of christmas past.
nakatomi? l.a.? you're
john mcclane, right?
who are you?
sam coleman.
wntw news.
excuse me.
give me a break.
i saw the stiff.
word is that was
your handiwork.
no. i only do
needlepoint.
great. national
just shut down.
totally iced.
they're going to
be sending us their planes.
happy, happy holiday.
the worst part,
mr. trudeau,
was the press.
oh, they were
here anyways,
crawling all over
the esperanza story,
so they got it right
on the fucking news.
you know,
bloodstains and all.
personally, i'd like
to lock every damn reporter
out of the airport,
but then they'd just pull
that freedom-of-speech
crap on us.
then the aclu would be
all over us.
murder on television.
hell of a start
for christmas weekend.
what is it? a gang thing
like last time?
only if your gangs get
their training at fort bragg.
who the hell
is this?
uh-uh,
mcclane.
i'm a police officer.
in an unauthorized area.
l.a., mr. trudeau,
don't mean shit.
that's what i said
about my last
cholesterol test.
so what's your problem,
lieutenant mcclane?
i'm sure captain lorenzo
has explained to you
the minor little fracas
with the minor little thieves.
maybe he can explain this.
all systems
tapped, colonel.
fire it up.
'' h'' minus five minutes.
stand by.
all right. we've got
a body in the morgue
that seems
to have died twice.
assuming it's not
a computer error,
what do we assume?
that somebody's about
to seriously fuck
with this airport.
what is that
supposed to mean?
i mean, i know we're dummies
up here, mcclane,
so give us a taste
of your genius.
this a hijacking?
a robbery? what?
look, i'm not sure.
oh, he's not sure.
well, i'm stunned.
i got to lie down.
the only people that go
to this much trouble
are professionals--
not luggage thieves and not punks.
professional at what?
what the fuck do you
think this is, huh,
the safety patrol here?
this is the resume
of a professional mercenary.
you got the world's
biggest drug dealer on his way here.
you need a slide rule
to figure this out,
or maybe another
body in a zipper bag
before you start
asking questions?
you're the one that gave us
that fucking body.
remember that.
yeah, i remember that.
lorenzo, have all your
shift commanders report in. now.
what? you're not
buying into this?
i want them to report
anything out of the ordinary,
no matter how trivial.
you got that?
yeah, i got it.
oh, my god!
what?
the runways.
what the hell?
they're shutting down.
jesus christ.
go to emergency
lighting now.
emergency. we are
in a code yellow.
backup systems
won't come up.
shunt to another
terminal.
bobby, what
do you got?
nothing.
the whole network is down.
maybe we should call
the power company, huh?
we're on the same goddamn grid.
we're hot.
<i>dulles, what's going on?</i>
<i>i'm on approach.</i>
maintain position. repeat.
<i>what's going on down there?</i>
roger. we're on it.
we're unable right now.
please delay.
fuji 604. execute published
missed-approach procedure
and hold.
twa 23, unable to clear you
for approach at this time.
climb to and maintain
one zero thousand.
i've checked all systems.
it ain't happening.
yeah, yeah, yeah...
what's it
look like?
approach control--
it's gone.
jesus. instrument
landing system is down.
confirmed.
i ls is dead.
every goddamn
system's dead.
and inmac monitors
are down.
attention all controllers.
attention.
we have a code-red alert.
every aircraft
approaching our sector
who are not already
in our landing pattern
gets diverted
to their alternate airport now.
everyone already on approach
or inside our pattern
holds at the outer markers.
stack 'em, pack 'em,
and rack 'em.
move.
get someone on it!
[beeping]
all right. not a word
of this leaves this room.
there must be 1 5,000 people
in this airport,
and we don't need panic
on our hands.
we just bought ourselves
maybe two hours.
after that,
those planes low on fuel
aren't going to
be circling.
they're going to be dropping
on the white house lawn.
mcclane, this
what you expected?
no.
this is just
the beginning.
[beeping]
faa hot line.
how could they
know already?
they can't.
maybe it's the boys
that pulled all your plugs.
put it on speaker.
<i>attention, dulles tower.</i>
<i>attention.</i>
<i>they say that blind men</i>
<i>become very attentive</i>
<i>by way of compensation.</i>
<i>now that you're both</i>
<i>blind and deaf,</i>
<i>i think i've got</i>
<i>your attention.</i>
<i>i'm aware your recorders</i>
<i>are active,</i>
<i>so i'll be quick.</i>
<i>you can play me back later</i>
<i>to your heart's content.</i>
how did you get on this line?
who is this?
<i>who i am is unimportant.</i>
<i>what i want...</i>
well, if you don't want
those planes
to start splashing
into the potomac
as they run out
of fuel,
what i want is
very important.
<i>aplane will be landing</i>
<i>at this airport</i>
<i>in 58 minutes.</i>
<i>it is fm-1,</i>
<i>foreign military one.</i>
<i>now, i'm sure you gentlemen</i>
<i>are well aware</i>
<i>of the unique nature...</i>
esperanza?
<i>of this flight,</i>
<i>the importance</i>
<i>of its cargo.</i>
this plane will not
be met by anyone.
it will land on a runway
of my designation,
where it will remain
isolated and unapproached.
that will conclude my interest
in this aircraft
and your responsibility
for it.
at the same time, i want
a 7 47 cargo conversion
fully fueled
and placed at my disposal.
<i>you have two more minutes</i>
<i>to advise your inbound aircraft</i>
<i>to hold at their</i>
<i>outer radio marker.</i>
<i>after that,you will be</i>
<i>able to receive only.</i>
<i>any attempt to restore</i>
<i>your systems</i>
<i>will be met</i>
<i>by severe penalties.</i>
he's bluffing.
damn it,
you can't do this.
i am doing this.
o.k., you guys,
listen up.
i need you to punch up
a code 1 5.
i got an idea,
and i need your help.
if esperanza gets
on that plane
and makes it to a country
with no extradition treaties,
we're fucked.
they're talking to us
on our own system.
they got to be close.
i'll have my men tear
this airport apart.
just in the nick
of time, huh?
hey, mcclane, i got
a first-class unit here,
s.w.a.t. team and all.
we don't need
any monday-morning quarterbacks.
my wife's on one
of the goddamn planes
these guys
are fucking with.
that puts me
on the playing field.
if you'd have moved your fat ass
when i told you to,
we wouldn't be hip deep
in shit right now.
that's it. security.
you're out of here.
mr. trudeau, do i
have to remind you
about faa regulations
regarding
unauthorized personnel
in the control tower?
all we have to do is find
a way to transmit.
yeah, right. somebody want
to run down to radio shack
and get a transmitter?
we already have one.
the new terminal wing
they're building--
when it's done,
all with their own
reservation computers,
all tied in to a nice
big antenna arrangement.
you'd better see
mr. mcclane out.
you got no business
being up here.
i'm telling you guys.
everything we need
is over
by the annex skywalk
just sitting there,
waiting to go on line.
the annex skywalk?
goddamn it, trudeau.
you're dealing
with pros here.
you can't fuck
with these people.
sam coleman.
wntw news.
mr. trudeau, there
are a lot of rumors
flying around here
today.
no way. no way, lady.
hell, no. no.
this is off limits,
coleman.
get them
out of here.
anything you can think of,
they'll think of, too!
get your fucking hands
off me.
for shit's sake.
just get them both out of here.
lobby security,
come in.
tomalson here.
this is
captain lorenzo here
with two unauthorized personnel
in the fucking tower.
now, would you get your thumb
out of your ass,
get them
out of the elevator,
or you're going to find
a goddamn pink slip
in your christmas
stocking.
goddamn!
anything who
can think of?
can't fuck
with what guy?
shit. hang on
over there.
just hang on.
big drug dealer on
his way to prison,
gunfight at airport,
every controller
in the coffee shop
getting beeped
and hauling ass,
and you rocking
the boat.
connection?
come on, mcclane.
just a few words.
o.k.,just a few words.
fuck off.
thanks, but i already got
that from colonel stuart.
stuart. the guy that got
canned by congress.
that's who he was.
huh? who he who?
what? hey!
shh! it's o.k.
i've done this before.
hi.
where's the other one?
claustrophobic,
i guess.
it's a vhf system,
but the planes are so close
it doesn't matter.
i can rig our frequency
in 30 minutes,
wire in a crossover,
and we're hot.
even the planes wouldn't
know the difference.
get what you need.
borrow. steal. kill.
i want my s.w.a.t. team
to go with him as cover.
whatever we can think of,
they can think of, too.
oh, man. i can't
fucking believe this.
another basement.
another elevator.
how can the same shit happen
to the same guy twice?
[singing]
what the fuck?

this is dulles approach
to all aircraft
<i>holding at potomac vortex.</i>
<i>we are experiencing</i>
<i>some technical problems here.</i>
<i>weather conditions, which have</i>
<i>been deteriorating all day,</i>
<i>have now been complicated</i>
<i>by an unforeseen human factor.</i>
<i>this has affected all</i>
<i>of our electronic equipment</i>
<i>and their redundant backups,</i>
<i>as well.</i>
<i>as a result, our nav</i>
<i>and approach systems are down,</i>
<i>and we expect to lose voice</i>
<i>in another minute.</i>
<i>we want you to continue</i>
<i>holding at the outer marker</i>
<i>as directed</i>
<i>and wait</i>
<i>for further instructions.</i>
<i>as soon as we're</i>
<i>back on line,</i>
<i>we'll expedite your landings</i>
<i>on a fuel-emergency basis.</i>
good luck.
god bless.
all right.
change the boards.
[grumbling]
[telephone ringing]
hey, stand back.
the skywalk
annex.
no, goddamn it.
the annex skywalk.
it's the last thing
i heard
before they
kicked me out.
well, let me
see here, now.
well, this must be it
right there.
see? that's
the raised platform,
and there's
the new terminal.
there's your skywalk.
goddamn bottleneck.
nice place
for an ambush.
what's
the fastest way
you can get me
out to that spot?
this kind of thing wasn't
in my job description.
don't worry, mr. barnes.
we'll watch your back.
yeah? who watches yours?
main ventilation duct.
main ventilation duct.
and bingo.
just once,
i'd like a regular,
normal christmas...
eggnog, a fucking
christmas tree,
a little turkey...
but, no, i got
to crawl around
in this
motherfucking tin can.
we're in the annex skywalk.
i can see the array.
i'll give you a call
for a protocol test
as soon as it's hot.
that's all for now.
sergeant, we need
some more equipment.
i'd like to send one
of your guys back for it.
right, sir.
you got it.
what the hell's
going on?
hey! put that
back on!
hey, asshole,
what do i look like to you?
a sitting duck.
take him!
shit!
damn it.
i hate it when i'm right.
look out!
get down!
aah!
aah!
stay down!
fuck!
come on.
fucking son
of a bitch.
aah!
shit.
ah. oh.
i'm going to kick
your fucking ass.
jeez.
you all right?
yeah. yeah.
but the antenna array--
i got to get to it
and set it up.
get down!
goddamn.
bait.
jerk us off,
make lorenzo sacrifice
his best men.
make you waste
your time...
time we don't have.
i think you're closer
than 50 yards.
so's that airplane.
practically.
yeah. there's quite
a few of them out there.
it looks like
a regular traffic jam.
there's nothing
regular about it.
see? you're intrigued.
that's my gift,
mrs. mcclane.
i notice things--
things other people
wouldn't see.
that's how i make
people curious.
don't you mean
nauseous?
look. the people have
a right to know
everything about everybody.
you got
in the way of that.
listen, buster, you
endangered my children,
and you didn't do it
for anything as noble
as the people.
the only time you even
see the people
is when you look down
to see what it is
you're stepping on.
me? yeah, i'll live,
but lorenzo's
s.w.a.t. team is dead,
and the antenna array
is gone.
[beeping]
didn't you see it?
it's hard looking
for a new miracle.
just hold
for a minute.
i'll be
right back.
just hold
for a second.
something's
going on here.
yeah.just hold on
for a minute.
i say again, annex team,
give us a sit rep.
annex team, come in.
do you copy?
it's got some kind
of scrambler on it.
can you do anything
with it?
no.
this scramble mode
must activate
on this code panel.
even if we scan
their frequency,
we can't listen in.
these guys are pros.
so are you.
break the code.
i want to hear
what these bastards are
saying to each other.
this is a 1 0-digit
control panel.
six-digit read-out.
hell, there could be
a million combinations.
next time you kill one
of these guys,
get him to enter
the code first.
yeah.
sir, we just
monitored a call
from their
chief engineer.
our people took out
their s.w.a.t. team completely.
you were right.
they went for the antenna array.
we're right
on schedule.
losing our own team
wasn't part of the plan.
attention, dulles tower.
<i>attention,</i>
<i>dulles control tower.</i>
<i>mr. trudeau,</i>
<i>i know you're listening.</i>
<i>unfortunately,</i>
<i>you're not obeying.</i>
try me face to face,
and we'll see.
you were warned not to try
to restore your systems.
<i>you've wasted lives</i>
<i>and precious time</i>
<i>on a futile</i>
<i>and obvious target.</i>
now you're going
to pay the penalty.
i've got five dead officers
down here, colonel stuart.
isn't that penalty enough?
mcclane,
you keep out of this.
you've been
nothing but a pain--
<i>oh, mcclane.</i>
<i>john mcclane.</i>
the policeman hero who saved
the nakatomi hostages.
<i>i read about you</i>
<i>in</i> people <i>magazine.</i>
<i>you seemed out of your league</i>
<i>on</i> nightline, <i>i thought.</i>
hey, colonel,
blow me.
how much drug money
is esperanza paying you
to turn traitor?
cardinal richelieu
said it best.
treason is merely
a matter of dates.
<i>this country's got to learn</i>
<i>that it can't keep</i>
<i>cutting the legs off</i>
of men like
general esperanza,
men who have the guts
to stand up
against
communist aggression.
and lesson one starts
with killing policemen?
<i>what's lesson two--</i>
<i>the neutron bomb?</i>
no. i think we can find
something in between.
watch this.
give me
a flight number,
one that's
low on fuel.
windsor 1 1 4.
transatlantic from london.
fuel tank's
dry as a martini.
activate the i ls
landing system,
but recalibrate
sea level
minus 200 feet.
oh,jesus!
they've reset ground level
minus 200 feet.
<i>windsor flight 1 1 4.</i>
this is dulles approach.

<i>dulles approach,</i>
<i>this is windsor 1 1 4.</i>

have you been?
<i>windsor 1 1 4.</i>
<i>dulles approach.</i>
<i>we've been right here</i>
<i>all along, old buddy.</i>
<i>our systems only came back</i>
<i>on line just this very second.</i>
windsor 1 1 4, you are cleared
for i ls approach,
<i>runway two-niner.</i>
<i>contact dulles tower frequency</i>
<i>at the outer marker.</i>
jesus christ,
he's going to crash
the fucking plane!
<i>roger, approach,</i>
<i>and about time.</i>
i've got 230 people up here
flying on petrol fumes.
<i>roger, 1 1 4. understand.</i>
<i>calibrate dulles</i>
<i>altimeter...</i>
oh,jesus.
they'll fly
right into the concrete.
son of a bitch!
why are they

it's our frequency!
why shouldn't they?
<i>dulles,</i>
<i>this is windsor 1 1 4.</i>
barnes!
<i>this is dulles tower.</i>
<i>we have radar contact...</i>
give me your coat!
<i>windsor 1 1 4, stand by...</i>
what are you
going to do?
whatever i can.
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>
as you've probably noticed,
we've started our descent.
<i>we're sorry</i>
<i>for the inconvenience,</i>
<i>but we'll all be on the ground</i>
<i>in a few minutes. thank you.</i>
please keep
your seat belts on.
oh, not to worry.
we've made arrangements
for your next flight,
so you won't
miss it, o.k.?
in your seat, please.
come on, in your seat.
oh, hey.
we're just like
british rail, love.
we may be late,
but we get you there.
don't worry.
good luck, mcclane!
[beep beep]
dulles, this is windsor 1 1 4,
<i>inside the outer marker.</i>
roger, 1 1 4.
this is dulles tower.
we have radar contact
and show you on i ls.
you're in the glide path,

there's somebody

it's mcclane.

that concludes
our object lesson
for this evening.
if the 7 47 we requested
is ready on time
and general esperanza's plane
arrives unmolested,
further lessons
can be avoided.
out.
[woman crying]
we got no sign
of survivors down here.
it's a goddamn nightmare.
hey, nelson!
come here.
barnes!
we've got to
warn those planes
there's a lunatic
down here.
get up to the cabin.
get me on the air.
how?
you figure it out!
here's the manifest.
mcclane, i know
how you must feel.
i wanted to help
those people.
i was pretty
goddamn useless.
we called
the government for help.
they're going to send in
a special army unit,
a counterterrorist team.
your wife's plane?
well, they're
still broadcasting
even though
we can't answer them.
they're going to run out of fuel
in 90 minutes.
listen, dick.
that is your name?
dick.
if you're going to continue
to get this close,
do you think
you might consider
switching
after-shaves?
anything else?
stronger mouthwash
might be nice.
<i>and here's sam coleman</i>
<i>reporting live</i>
<i>from the site of the accident.</i>
well, colonel,
they've done everything
we've anticipated...
so far.
<i>but still there has been</i>
<i>no official word.</i>
<i>meanwhile, despite the fact</i>
<i>only one runway has been</i>
<i>closed due to the tragedy,</i>
<i>several dozen airliners are</i>
<i>visible from where i stand,</i>
<i>endlessly</i>
<i>circling the field.</i>
<i>other reports say that</i>
<i>there was trouble in the tower</i>
<i>before the crash</i>
<i>and that that may have even</i>
<i>contributed to it.</i>
<i>one thing is certain.</i>
<i>with weather conditions</i>
<i>worsening,</i>
<i>the problem here</i>
<i>and in the sky above us</i>
<i>will continue to grow.</i>
<i>i'm samantha coleman at dulles</i>
<i>international airport.</i>
victor. victor.
victor.
yeah, what's up?
did you pack the radio mikes
from the shoot,
or did you put them
in your carry-on?
are you crazy?
i wouldn't let those assholes
check them in.
i love you.
give me one
of the receivers.
can you tune in
to the cockpit frequency?
yeah. why?
i want to hear
what's going on.
should be right here
on our band.
nothing.
you just told me
it would work.
is it working
or not working?
it is working,
but it's--
all i'm getting
is some kind
of airport beacon.
it's weird.
it's like the tower
isn't there.
stay on it.
let me know when there is
something there.
o.k.
major grant.
we're blue light.
rollins, department
ofjustice.
trudeau, chief
of air operations.
lorenzo,
terminal police.
you want something,
you got it.
this is it?
one fucking platoon?
one crisis-1 platoon.
who are you?
john mcclane.
mcclane, you showed
some balls out there, man.
yeah.
now show some
good sense.
let the pros
handle this.
yeah, well,
it looks like
the pros are on
the wrong team tonight.
isn't colonel stuart
one of your men?
no, not anymore,
he's not.
now we're here
to take colonel
stuart down.
and we will
take him down.
you see,
i served with him.
i taught him
everything he knows.
well, maybe
he's learned
a few more things
since then.
let's hustle!
the command post
will be set up
in the airport
police station.
i want to be
tied in to the tower
in 1 5 minutes.
all right,
let's do it!
hey, trudeau.
did things just get
better or worse?
lights--
big, portable lights.
we set up the field,
and then we--
we wait for those lunatics
to shoot them out.
and where do we get
those big, portable lights--
borrow them
from batman?
what about
the airphone idea?
there's 1 8 planes
up there.
only five of them
have those phones.
we got through
to three of them.
we're still trying
on the others.
that leaves 1 3 accidents
waiting to happen.
are they still
bucking head winds?
i just checked
the weather.
head winds are
slamming everybody
over the outer marker.
the planes
with enough fuel
have already been
shunted to atlanta,
memphis, and nashville.
outer marker.
damn!
the outer marker!
it's a beacon, right?
it sends out this
''beep beep beep''
so they know they're
over it, right?
so?
so who says
that radio signal
has to just beep?
right.
we switch the frequency
from the tower
over to the one in the beacon.
we pump up the wattage.
and we can talk
to our planes,
and those bastards
who did this
will never know!
traced the signal.
found it in
the luggage area.
they've been tapped in
to your tower chatter
all night.
punks stealing luggage,
huh, carmine?
how you doing,
telford?
no good.
i called lang.
they're rigging
a portable decoder.
it'll be here
in two hours.
my wife doesn't
have two hours.
i was only transferred
to grant's team yesterday.
the regular guy
got appendicitis.
word is, nobody's better
at this than major grant.
attention!
except maybe
colonel stuart.
i want to hear about
the plane
those bastards asked for.
then i'll fill you in
on my orders.
pilots' briefing room.
now.
keep working.
albertson.

no civilians.
what the fuck?
what is it?
the outer marker beeper.
it isn't beeping.
it's talking.

i'll find it.
you'll mess up my whole

pilots' briefing room.
i think that's
in the main terminal,
so would that be under
'' p'' for pilots' briefing room?
or maybe it would be
under '' m''

i know he's
about to go on.
that's why i need him.
you'll have to hold on--
put me through, celia,
or start typing
your resume.
esperanza's down--
esperanza's down--
but he's hurt.
he took a round
in his shoulder.
plus i got
one more of their guys.
that's six
they lost altogether.
maybe if we knew how many
they had to start with,
we could get excited,
but if they got 50 guys,
it's a little early
to break out the champagne!
now, we appreciate
your effort, mcclane,
but we don't need
a loose cannon on this deck!
what if they decide
to crash another plane
in retaliation
for your little stunt?
they can't do that
anymore, right, barnes?
besides, if i
grabbed esperanza,
this would
all be over by now.
well, maybe they're just
a little bit more creative
than you think!
well, at least
i'm thinking, goddamn it!
listen, you wise-ass,
we're here to jerk off
that cocksucker
until he tries
to take off.
period!
now, you're the wrong guy
in the wrong place
at the wrong time!
the story of my life.
major,
pentagon situation room,
sir!
pentagon.
i'll take it
in here.
thank you, telford.
you men
come with me.
mcclane.
yeah, barnes.
you said those guys
showed up out there
right away?
yeah.
that means they're
on the field or close,
and i think
i know where.
come here. let me
show you something.
these are the old plans
when the longer
runways went in.
that's 1 2 years ago.
looks like they've done
some modifications on site--
moved tra con phones, i ls,
all the underground stuff
so they could
handle drainage.
if i'm right,
all of it would run
right along the airport property
and go right past
this neighborhood.
we should have been
on the ground two hours ago!
i understand,
but if you just relax...
it's hopeless.
somebody ought to get
their ass kicked for this mess,
that's for sure.
well, unfortunately,
there really isn't anyone
we can blame for the weather.
oh, yeah? what about
that porker willard scott?
i should have
taken the bus.
at least they can pull over
for food and gas.
excuse me.
yes?
i was just wondering.
this flight originally
was supposed to be
mm-hmm.
do we have
enough fuel
to keep circling
like this?
oh, of course.
they anticipate
little problems like this.
barnes, we looked
at 1 2 fucking houses,
and we're nowhere.
this is
our last possibility.
over here there's
an old church.
let's go.
wait.
there's the church
over there.
could be a sentry.
and he could just be
out for a walk.
then why is he going over
his own footsteps?
come on.
all right.
just stay here and get ready
to call the marines.
i thought
they were the army.
who gives a fuck?
just be ready.
[beeping]
oh, shit.
not now.
aah!
lorenzo, it's barnes.
barnes, where the hell
did you go?
where's mcclane?
he's with me.
we're at the hidey lake
community church
on the west side
of the airport.
you're where?
goddamn it!
you crazy idiot,
why didn't--
this must be their
base of operations.
shut up and get
your ass over here!
move it!
code red! sit rep.
we got positive i.d.
on stuart's location.
let's move.
yo!
our escape plane
will be ready
within 30 minutes,
general.
if there are
no more surprises.
gentlemen, we have
a situation here.
aah!
oh!
[whistle]
over here.
jeez, mcclane, you all right?
you want a medic?
what the hell you think
you're doing out there,
playing john wayne?
how would you like
to spend the night in a cell?
lorenzo, shut the fuck up
and do something useful.
go seal off the street.
hey, you can't
talk to me like that.
oh, no, carmine?
sergeant, get this bureaucrat
out of mr. mcclane's
face now.
with pleasure, sir.
major...
the men are
in position, sir.
close up the back.
then we go in.
fire only on my order.
roger that, sir.
guess i was
wrong about you.
you're not such
an asshole after all.
no, you were right.
i'm just your kind
of asshole.
[beeping]
garber, sit rep!
army special forces
on three sides,
closing in fast
around the back!
another problem,
colonel?
no problem, general.
gentlemen,
you know what to do.
down!
get down! get down!
[beeping]
[beeping]
general...it's time.
[power cuts off]
[beeping]
come on, let's move it!
they're pulling out
out the back!
move it!
albertson, take your men
around the back.
aah!
aah!
this equipment,
it could land our planes.
there were trip wires outside.
they could have booby-trapped--
they did.
got one here, too.
looks like c-4.
the motherfucker is armed.
clear the area!
everybody, now!
they booby-trapped
all the equipment.
seal off
the building!
shit!
post sentries.
no civilians allowed.
hey, where the fuck
is mcclane?
miller, take him!
i'll cover you!
aah!
so much
for the element of chance.
let's move out.
ohh...
i had the bastard
in my sights.
i know i did.
oh,jesus christ.
<i>attention, tower.</i>
<i>attention, dulles tower.</i>
<i>this is colonel stuart.</i>
<i>is our plane prepared?</i>
it is.
it's in hangar 1 1 .
it's the most
remote building we've got.
we're on our way.
<i>have a ground crew there</i>
<i>to confirm the condition</i>
<i>of the plane.</i>
do you believe the balls
on this son of a bitch?
colonel, you're quite capable of
confirming it yourself.
now, please, don't ask us
to gift-wrap potential
hostages for you.
major grant,
isn't it?
if you remember me,
colonel,
then you remember i know
the drill as well as you do.
check out
your own fucking plane.
we move out
in five minutes.
flak jackets
for everybody.
body armor for
the assault team.
night scopes
for the snipers.
we will take them
in the hangar,
and i will
pull that detonator
out of stuart's
dead fucking hand myself.
take all your men
back to the airport.
seal off every exit
in case they try
to slip past us
to break out
onto the ground.
you got it.
all right,
here we go.
dick, this is nuts.
every station in town
has people out at the airport,
and none of them has
heard even a whisper
of this shit
you're running now!
well,
none of them is me.
you want proof,
try this.
<i>repeat. terrorists</i>
<i>have murdered civilians</i>
<i>and cut off the two systems</i>
<i>that can allow you to land.</i>
<i>a special u.s. army unit</i>
<i>is already here</i>
<i>and preparing</i>
<i>to take out the terrorists.</i>
jesus christ.
i want you
to go live now.
get me in from the files--
a publicity shot.
connie's got one.
the maps--get one from weather.
we're on it.
we're cutting in five minutes!
tell the affiliates
if they want in,
they got three minutes
to shout.
let's do this.
network, here i come.
hey, telford,
what was your
chicken shit outfit doing
while we
were taking grenada?
- ha ha ha!
- ha ha ha!
grenada-- five minutes
of fire fight,
five weeks of surfing.
i wish i was
with you guys for that.
yeah. me, too, kid.
really, sir?
sure.
then we wouldn't
have to do this.
[beeping]
eagle nest,
this is hatchling.
on schedule...
and in position.
roger, hatchling.
we are secure here.
you have
a green light.
i repeat, a green light.
[whistling]
oh!
jesus, officer,
where did you come from,
pearl harbor?
uh!
all right,
let's clear it out, please.
stand by.
<i>this is a special bulletin</i>
<i>from wzdc news.</i>
<i>there was a plane crash</i>

<i>and now,</i>
<i>with an exclusive wzdc report,</i>

[thornberg]
<i>i'm one of the thousand people</i>
<i>who has been circling</i>

look out!
lady, look out!
look out! look out!
look out! look out!
get out of the way!
ho!
get out of the way!
get out
of the way, lady!
go, go, go!
hey, hey, look out!
this is a recording
of a conversation
between dulles tower
and a captive aircraft overhead.
get out of the way!
lorenzo!
mcclane, are you out
of your fucking mind?
the blue light team--
where are they?
stuart's got explosives
in the church rigged with a remote.
where's grant?
they're going to kill
that son of a bitch
and get it from them!
they're not
going to do that!
they're going to
get on the same plane with him
and take off
with him!
get the fuck
out of here!
when the army
canned stuart,
he loaded that unit
with his own men!
are you nuts?
that fire fight--
sideshow to buy
them some time.
mcclane, you are
completely around the fucking bend.
you're under arrest,
you motherfucker.
here! these
are the bullets
they used
out there tonight!
blanks!
jesus christ.
this is chief lorenzo.
i want
every officer recalled
and assembled in body armor
and full weaponry
in the motor pool
in five minutes.
it's time to kick ass.
just like iwojima!
<i>this reporter has learned</i>
<i>that the terrorists</i>

<i>the terrorists</i>

and now that
the special army commandos
have arrived at the airport,
the likelihood
of a full-scale, deadly battle
is dangerously close.
that stupid, arrogant
son of a bitch.
it's all over the airport.

when are we
going to land?
<i>...and unfortunately</i>
<i>they may not be the last.</i>

all right, listen up!
all units, i want you
to converge on hangar 1 1 ,
all sides!
this car, mcclane!
get in!
when the city blue

they'll pick up
the pieces!
now, move out!
mcclane, say hi
to my brother vito.
merry christmas.
hi.
goddamn it
to hell!

right now!
right there.
right there. get that.
hey, coleman!

colonel, if i may say so,
you are some piece of work.
thank you, major.
you're not
so bad yourself.
congratulations
on your escape, sir.
thank you, major.

should save them
until we
are all safe, hmm?
sir.
my congratulations,
gentlemen.
you've won a victory
for our way of life,
my pride, my admiration,
and a kick-ass vacation.
now, get on board.

cowboy, ride too rough?
i don't
like to fly.

are you doing here?
i don't like
to lose, either.
o.k. whoo! here we go!
i don't know
about you guys,

enough fucking snow
to last me
a lifetime.
you don't get much of that
in the tropics, major.
for you, gentlemen,
we'll import it.
shit!
they left the hangar!
right there.
right there.
