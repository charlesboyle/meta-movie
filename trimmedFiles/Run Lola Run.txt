and the end of all our exploring

<i>man...</i>
<i>... probably the most mysterlous
specles on our planet.</i>
<i>a mystery of unanswered questlons...</i>
<i>who are we? where do we come from?</i>
<i>where are we golng? how do we
know. what we thlnk we know?</i>
<i>why do we belleve anythlng at all?</i>
<i>countless questlons
in search of an answer.</i>
<i>an answer that wlll glve
rlse to a new questlon...</i>
<i>... and the next answer wlll glve
rlse to the next questlon and so on...</i>
<i>... and so on.</i>
<i>but, in the end, isn 't it
always the same questlon?</i>
<i>and always the same answer?</i>
the ball is round.
the game lasts 90 minutes.
that's a fact. everything
else is pure theory.

when ronnie gets here in 20 minutes
i'll be a goner.

i'll be there in 20 minutes.
<i>- okay?

it's worst at night.
i wake up and can't fall asleep again.
and then i'm afraid.
me! afraid of the dark!
i've never been afraid of the dark.
i've never even been afraid before.
but i think about us...
...and i just think
it'll keep going on like this.
that you wouldn't dare...
and then i ask myself
what i'm doing here.
how long will this go on?
the secrecy, all this damned lying?
should i grow old, waiting for a man
who won't stand by me?
hey, you need a bike?
no!
and then
hey man! i know that!
it's not my fault it's so much money!
with 500 marks?
thanks.
your phone card!
i have to go. meyer will be
here in a minute.
ca n we nm eet ate r on?

- what?
do you love me?
why are you asking me now?
do you love me?
yes, damn it!
then decide.
not now.
you have to decide sometime.
but why now, here, at once?
because i'm pregnant.
look who's here!
our little princess, lola!
what a rare pleasure.
- why the rush?
- please, let me in.
little miss wants to see big daddy?

have a baby with me?
yes.
lola?
dad.
your daughter?
i'm jutta hansen
from the board of directors.
- sorry to interrupt. it's urgent.
- it's okay. i was just about to...

...more than i ever have before and
you're the only one who can help me...
...would you help me?

i can't explain now.
would you help me?
with what, damn it?!
i need 100.000 marks immediately.

the next five minutes or else...
- or else what?
- something terrible will happen!
i don't understand.
what's going on here today?
please, dad! you've got to help me! please!
- i don't have 100.000 marks.
- what about my life insurance?
what about it?
it isn't worth 100.000
please, dad, i'm serious.
this isn't a joke!
yes, it is, lola!
you can't be serious!
- if you don't help me, he'll die!
- who'll die?

i don't even know him.
why will he die?
it doesn't matter!
okay. come with me.

i'm leaving you guys
and i'm marrying another woman.
we're going to have kids. i'll try to be
happy because she only wants me.
<i>i'm so sick of hearing
''all you do is work.''</i>
<i>''you always play the boss!''</i>
maybe i do, but so what!
you guys have no idea!
i'm so tired of being
blamed for everything!
sure, daddy's money is good enough
right? well, not anymore!
not anymore.
besides, i'd never have
fathered a freak like you.
- but you did, you jerk!
- no, i didn't!
you're not mine.
now you know.
the guy who sired you left
before you were even born.
throw her out, please.

hurry, before the cops come.
don't move!
do you love me?

how can you be sure?
i don't know. i just am.
i could be some other girl.
why not?
- because you're the best.
- the best what?
the best girl.
in the whole world?
sure.
how do you know?
i just know.
you think so.
okay, i think so.
- you see?
- what?
you aren't sure.
are you nuts, or what?
what if you never met me?
what do you mean?
you'd be saying the same
thing to someone else.
- okay, if you don't want to hear it...
- i don't want to hear anything.
i want to know how you feel.
okay.
my feelings say...
...you're the best.
<i>your feelings?
who is ''your feelings'' anyway?</i>
it's me.
my heart.
<i>your heart says
'' hi, manni. she's the one. ''</i>
exactly.
<i>and you say, '' thanks for the info.
talk to you soon. ''</i>
exactly.
and you do whatever your heart says?
<i>well, it doesn't really ''say'' anything.</i>
i don't know...
...it just feels.
so what does it feel now?
that someone's asking
rather stupid questions.
you aren't taking me seriously.
lola, what's wrong?
do you want to...
...leave me?
i don't know.
i think i have to make a decision.
but i don't want to...
i don't want to leave.
stop!
lola, are you going shopping?
i need shampoo.
of course, i knew that
sagittariuswas your ascendant.
sure, the more i think about it.
i don't know.
yes, but you're married too.
excuse me!
watch it, you stupid cow!
fucking bitch!
and then
hey, you need a bike?
no.
- 50 marks, as good as new.
- but it's stolen!
with 500 marks?
tell me, do you want to
have a baby with me?
yes.
even if it isn't yours?
look who's here! lola, our...
i'm in a hurry, please!
please let me in!
courtesy and composureare
the queen's jewels.
let me in, please.
a little anger is good for the heart...
...the circulation, the skin.
what kind of love is that?!
- if you hadn't neglected me...
- i have a family!
i can't leave a sick wife and three
kids just to please her highness.
your wife is drunk
from morning to night!
so what!
what do you know?
can't you see you're interrupting?
hi, dad.
why didn't you knock?
what's going on?
what do you want?
is she your daughter?
shut the door.
what do you want?
i need your help.
- you see that i'm busy.
- there's no other way.
damn it! why did you
have to show up here now?!
i have a problem.
do you understand?
who's that slut?
that's none of your business!
lola, leave.
go home.
leave me alone.
i can't!
why not?
i need money.
then get a job.
i will, but i need the money now!
okay, just so you get out of here.
how much?
no, i need lots more.
<i>what do you mean, ''lots more''?</i>
a whole lot more!
aren't you ashamed barging in like
this? can't you see we're busy?
i don't give a shit, you stupid cow!
i have other problems.
don't you dare...
what?
what's going on?
it just isn't your day today.
doesn't matter.
you can't have everything.
you're coming with me.
have you lost your mind?
- you think you can do anything you like?
- shut up! you go first.
kid...
...you don't know how to
use that thing.
let me make a suggestion.
stay back.
- listen, we can talk this over.
- fuck off!
and then
shit!
the combination.
quiet!
what the heck are you doing?
lola, there are cameras everywhere.
you'll never get out of here.
the police will be here in a second.
you said they always come too late.
bag it. 100.000
come on, kid.
leave your daddy alone.
you don't want to
hurt anyone, do you?
i don't know.
- i don't have it.
- why not?
there's only 88.000
i'll have to get the
rest from downstairs.
okay, get going!
go, go!
hurry up, man!
in there.
bye, dad.
i don't believe it.
you want to get killed, kid?
attention! this is the police!
the building is surrounded.
come out with your hands up.
what a ruckus!
do you have the time?
get out of the way!
give me a lift, will you?
- are you nuts?
- wait!
<i>walt, mannl! i'm comlng.</i>
<i>i'm almost there...</i>
<i>walt!</i>
<i>i'm gonna make lt!</i>
what would you do if i died?
- i wouldn't let you die.
- yeah, but...
...what if i were fatally ill?
- i'd find a way.
- what if i were in a coma...
<i>...and the doctor said
''one more day''?</i>
i'd throw you into the ocean.
shock therapy.
okay, but what if i died anyway?
- what do you want to hear?
- come on, tell me.
i'd go to the isle of rügen
and cast your ashes to the wind.
and then?
i don't know. it's a stupid question.
i know what you'd do.
- you'd forget me.
- no!
sure, you would.
what else could you do?
sure, you'd mourn for a few weeks.
it wouldn't be so bad.
everybody's real compassionate.
and everything's so incredibly sad,
and everyone feels sorry for you.
you can show everyonehow strong you are.
<i>''what a great woman, '' they'll say.</i>
<i>''she's pulling herself together
instead of crying all day. ''</i>
and suddenly, this really nice
guy with green eyes shows up.
and he's super sensitive
and listens to you all day.
and you can talk his ear off.
and you can tell him how tough
things are for you...
...that you have to look after yourself
and you don't know what'll happen...
then you'd hop onto his lap and cross me
off your list. that's how it goes.
what?
you're not dead yet.
no?
lola, are you going shopping?
i need shampoo.
of course, i knew that
sagittariuswas your ascendant.
sure, the more i think about it.
i don't know.
yes, but you're married too.
and then
- watch out!
- sorry.
i bet you're sorry!
fries and a sausage.
give me another one.
i'll be damned.
life's really crazy
sometimes isn't it?
come on, kid.
i'll buy you a drink.
you need a bike?
a special price. 70 marks.
mr. meyer?
is everything okay?
tell me, do you want to
have a baby with me?
yes.
<i>mr. meyer is here.</i>
- there's something else.
- not now.
<i>mr. meyer asked if he should
parkor if you're comlng out?</i>
i'm coming.
this is the nicest present
you could give me.
i'll see you later?
hi there.
- hi there, ms. jäger.
- hello.
- nice to see you.
- hello, mr. meyer.
wait!
you know what?
i just had a strange encounter.
yes, with your daughter!
- with whom?
- your daughter.
shit! shit!
you've come at last, dear.
thanks.
wait.
so i decided, it'd be best
for me not to have kids.
i work so muchthat
they'd never see me.
watch out!
<i>what can i do?</i>
<i>what can i do?</i>
