it'd be all right.
but it has to be in your mind.
what?
one shot?
two is pussy.
i don't think about one shot
that much any more, mike.
you have to think about
one shot.
one shot is what
it's all about.
a deer has to be taken
with one shot.
i try to tell people that,
they don't listen.
you really think
about vietnam?
yeah.
i don't know.
i guess i'm thinking
about the deer.
going to nam.
i like the trees, you know?
i like the way the trees are
in the mountains,
it's all different.

i sound like
some asshole, right?
i'll tell you, nick, you're the
only guy i go hunting with, you know?
i like a guy
with quick moves and speed.
i ain't gonna hunt
with no assholes.
who's an asshole?
who do you think's
an asshole?
they're all
a bunch of assholes.
i mean, i love them.
they're great guys.
but, you know,
without you, i'd hunt alone.
seriously,
that's what i'd do.
but you're a fucking nut.
you know that, mike?
you're a maniac.
control freak.
i just don't like
no surprises.
