we're talking about humor.
yes, you asked me about
my mother-in-law.
do you have a joke about her?
no, why make a joke on a mother-in-law?
do you ever laugh on people
with a retardation?
here in america we try not to make fun of
or be funny with things
that people don't choose.
but perhaps you have not seen
someone with a very funny retardation.
my brother, bilo,
have a very funny retardation.
mental retardation causes a lot of pain
and hardship for a lot of families.
sometime my sister, she show her
vagina to my brother, bilo, and say,
"you will never get this!
you will never get this!"
he behind his cage, crazy, crazy.
everybody laugh.
she go, "you never get this!"
but one time,
he break cage and he get this.
and then we all laugh.
high five!
now...
no, that would not be funny
in america, okay?
what is "not" jokes?
a "not" joke is when we're trying
to make fun of something
and what we do is we make
a statement that we pretend is true
but, at the end, we say, "not,"
which means it's not true.
so teach me how to make one.
- all right, what color is your suit?
- this suit is gray.
gray, i would call it blue, okay?

but it's certainly not black, right?
- let's say it's gray, but...
- it is gray.
okay, so a "not" joke, i would say
"that suit is black. not!"
this suit is not black.
- no, no, "not" has to be the end.
- oh, okay.
this suit is black not.
this suit is black, pause...
you know what a pause is?
- yes.
- this suit is black. not!
this suit is black. pause. not.
no, you don't say "pause."
this suit is black.
that's a pause. not!
this suit is black.

i love you.
- do you believe in magic, miss...
- parker, c.j.
it's a pleasure to meet you, c.j.
be careful! be careful, c.j.!
this c.j. was like no
kazakh woman i had ever seen.
she had golden hairs,
teeth as white as pearls
and the asshole of a 7-year-old.
for the first time in my lifes,
l was in love.
(choir chanting)
(horn blows)
get up! get up!
why aren't you ready!
we have people to interview today.
i understand.
learn what you can from
this women's group.
- my hair?
- it's beautiful. don't worry.
in kazakhstan it is illegal for more than
five woman to be in the same place
except for in brothel or in grave.
in the u.s. and a., many womens meet
in groups called feminists.
i find more.
veteran feminists
of america
so, what means this feminism?
it's the theory that women
should be equal to men
in matters economic, social...
- now you are laughing.
- yes.
well, that is the problem.
do you think a woman should be educate?
definitely.
but is it not a problem that a woman
have a smaller brain than a man?
that is wrong.
but the government scientist,
dr. yamak, prove it's the size of squirrel.
your government's scientist?
- yes, dr. yamak.
- he's wrong. he's wrong.
give me a smile, baby. why angry face?
well, what you're saying
is very demeaning.
- do you know the word "demeaning"?
- no.
we are saying to you...
l could not concentrate on what
this old man was saying.
all i could think about was this
lovely woman in her red water-panties.
who was this c.j.?
last night i see in my hotel room
a woman called c.j. on the television.
- do you know her?
- no.
she from a town called baywatches.
- she's just on television.
- her name is pamela.
- do she live here in new york city?
- she lives in california.
- in the california.
- he's gonna look her up.
okay, can we finish now?
listen, pussycat, smile a bit.
- all right. that's it. i'm done.
- we're finished. we have to leave.
although i was obsessed
by this c.j., i could not pursue her
or else my wife would snap off my cock.
mr. sagdiyev?
- yes?
- i have a telegram for you.
- you can read?
- yes, i can.
"dear borat sagdiyev,
"your wife, oxna,
"was walking your retarded bilo
in the woods
"when a bear attacked
and violated and break her.
"she is now dead."
you say my wife is dead?
this is what it's...
yes, sir. i'm sorry to inform you,
but that's what the telegram says.
high five! great!
what do you mean, california?
i have arranged all our filming
for new york.
but we need to leave new york
to find the real america:
rodeos, cowboys...
it will be better for our documentary.
but why california?
what's there?
pearl harbor is there...
and so is texas.
eventually, i persuade azamat
that we would travel to california
and make our reportings along the way.
he insists we not fly in case the jews
repeated their attack of 9/11.
okay, i'll find another way
for us to get there.

- do this have a pussy magnet?
- no.
the vehicle itself will be a magnet.

in this country as a magnet.

"pamela is a fairly simple girl,
she recently explained.
"'there's not a whole lot of logic
in the way i live my life.
"'i am very spontaneous."'
i'm very spontaneous too.
i needed a gift to give to pamela
so that she would grant me
entry into her vagina.
therefore, i convinced azamat to let me
film a report in an american store.
don't spend more than $3.
we're low on money.
this your shops?
right, this is my antique shop.
why do you have
so many things with a flag?
we're honoring our heritage.
now, what in here? what is this?
these are a number of collectibles.
i mean, this is a lamp that, you know,
you would use in your home.
this is a chinese cloisonné bell.
and this is a little decorative duck.
and do you think, you know, when they...
(vase crashing)
i'm sorry. wait, wait, wait.
- we need help, baby.
- no, it's okay.
i sorry.
sorry. i will repair all of this.
don't worry.
my friend, he can make glue and...
i don't think you're gonna be able to glue
it. you're gonna have to pay for it.
okay, i have a digital watch
from the future.
i will give you.
is worth more than all of this.
you broke $425 worth of stuff.
- that's not enough.
- do you want hair...
no, i don't want any damn hair.
this is best hair in kazakhstan.
feel the quality.
i don't want your damn hair.
this is hair from pubis.
i can get 2,000 bags by next friday.
we don't use that stuff in this country.
have you offered them pubic hair?
yes!
just give me another 20.
it was a mistake.
you screwed up again.
i didn't see the truck.
- i slipped on it and that was it.
- only an idiot could do this.
would you have believed this
if i had told you? all right. go. go. go.
(azamat shouting)
(shouting continues)
you've ruined this documentary
and almost bankrupt us.
so call the ministry
and get more money.
what? if i did that,
they would kill us!
california had better be as good
as you say, or we're finished.
you bastard.
what's the matter with you?
how dare you make
hand-party over pamela.
why do you care who i
pleasure myself to?
because i love this woman.
she's the reason
we travel to california!
