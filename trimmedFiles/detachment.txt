"and never have i felt so
deeply at one and the same time
so detached from myself
and so present in the world"
(albert camus)
french philosopher and writer
"for henry"
i wasn't good in school.
i didn't care for school.
uhm ... it was nice socially,
my own experience, but
i kinda just went along...
i started off as a music major.
i was gonna be
a rock 'n' roll star.
but that didn't quite
work out.
in 1985,
during a hurricane,
hurricane gloria,
i was walk... i was taking
a train into the city to work.
i'd gotten to work and i was on
the phone with my brother-in-law,
who had just
started teaching,
and he said that he was
off from school.
now, now,
wait a second,
you're off from school
for hurricane
and i'm goin' into the city
to work in an office building?
i said: "whoa, that's a
pretty good gig, right."
my mom was a teacher and i knew
without a shadow of a doubt
from early childhood that
the one job i would never do
was become a teacher.
never ever i would take
toll cards on a turnpike.
i'd be a shepard, anything,
rather than become a teacher.
i decided to become a teacher
because i wanted to do
something with my life besides
what i was doing
which was driving a truck,
for a company and,
i decided i wanted to do
a little bit better for myself
so i got into teaching
a little bit.
i went back to school
at the age of 37.
a friend of mine from college...
his aunt was the...
principal of an all-girls
inner city school
in newark, new jersey, and
they were desperate for teachers
so, i thought "great,
i can do this for a year,
it'll keep my father from making
me get a job at prudential,
and then i'll figure out
what i wanna do."
well, they called me up
asking me to go to an interview,
and i happened to get an job
in a junior high school,
in queens,
and i ended up...
starting it at my...
what's now?... my 30th year.
most of the teachers here,
at one point...
...they believed...,
that they could
make a difference
you know, i know
how important it is to
have guidance and to have
someone help understand
the complexities
of the world
that we live in.
i didn't really have that
growing up.

and cried loudly, with volume.
but the tears were
all for myself.
and that's where it
all went wrong.
uh hi, lupe, dean vargas here.
uh i'm sick and uh..won't be
coming in today, allright?
get to the point, dr. hart.
i've got a school to run.
your state scores have gone
down in the last three years.
- you're not delivering... - don't pretend
like you don't know the game.
you earmarked my school
as a transfer dump
for the worst kids in
the district.
well, kids deserve an education,
don't you agree?
i agree you're jerking of
and wasting my time.
- get to the point, dr. hart...
- we need consensus builders.
- new methodology.
- you're corporatizing the system.
no, we're cleaning house.
the superintendent feels that
it's time your stepped down.
babe, you got some fuckin'
nerve coming into my yard
with the hard fuckin' sell.
carol, there was a time
when you were an educator.
you were very well respected.
why don't you go
out on top?
oi!
everybody sit down
and shut up,
or i start pulling out
the referrals.
sit!
sit down!
i am starting the dvd.
i am starting the dvd.
- barth or barthes
- barth. mr. barth.
mr. henry barthes
so you've taken long term
assignments at ah..
"lock and mcarthur"?
"the fringe."
well, that's... that's...where the work's at.
this a month-long assignment,
until i can fill it permanently.
i asked to meet with you
because you come
highly recommended as the
best sub on the call sheet.
hmmph....that's a somewhat
dubious endorsement.
i agree, mr. barth.
you'll find many of your
students functioning
well below grade level.
teach the curriculum,
most importantly.
understood?
- good morning
- good morning
i'm mr. barthes.
those of you who haven't
heard, this is english 11 a.
- yes
- yeah
listen up, i have one rule.
just one.
if you don't wish to be here
don't come.
dude, what does that mean?
it's not dude, it's mr. barthes.
the s is silent.
- you're fuckin' gay.
- marcus, shut up!
no, you shut up!
you dyke bitch!
hey, marcus.
guess what.
what?
you're free to leave.
- like right now?
- like right now.
- aight yo..
- catch you later, man.
- what the fuck? you want me
to go to the dean's office?
- i don't care where you go.
everyone pull out
a sheet of paper.
i'd like to assess what your
individual writing skills are.
what if we aint got no paper?
okay here is the situation.
you're dead.
- alright, write an brief
but detailed essay about...
- hey jackass! i asked you
a fucking question!
...about what a friend
or a parent
might say about you
during your funeral. ok?
- you have 30 minutes.
- oh, shit...
i asked you a motherfuckin'
question, didn't i?
anything else?
you'd better back the fuck up
before i fuckin' rock ya shit.
that bag,
it doesn't have any feelings.
it's empty.
i don't have any feelings
you can hurt either. ok?
i understand you're angry.
i used to be very
angry too, ok. i get it.
you have no reason to be
angry with me, because
i am one of the few people that's
here trying to give you an opportunity.
now i am going to ask you,
to just sit down,
and do your best,
and i'll give you a piece
of paper. how's that?
can i get a fuckin' pen too?
kids don't have any
attention span. they're bored.
so how are you supposed to
reel them in with classic literature
if they don't...if they don't believe
that you
have something meaningful
to share.
thank you.
why'd you throw marcus
out of class but not jerry?
well i had to make an
example out of somebody.
anyway, marcus verbally
assaulted you,
that's not allowed
in my classroom.
and, what they say to me
is immaterial.
what's your name?
meredith.
nice to meet you, meredith.
so you really don't care
what the kids say to you?
perhaps i've gotten
used to it.
i wish i could be
that strong.
it doesn't take strength,
meredith. you gotta...
understand that unfortunately
most people lack self-awareness.
you should really keep that
in mind as you head into
the trenches of
second period.
you'll meet them again
at every age.
- i want to see the principal.
- that's her, mom.
you the bitch that expelled
my baby? --excuse me.  -and for what?
- excuse me, maybe you'd like...
- because you can't handle it?
and bitch, why are you here?
you wanna be at home with her everyday.
i don't have time for this bullshit!do you understand me?
- keep your voice down!
- why are you here?
hey maam, clam down.
we'll go talk about this
in the dean's office.
- i ain't goin' nowhere with you.
look, miss, i know
you're angry
but they won't listen to you,

hi guys.
thanks for staying late,
all 15 or 20 of you.
today we'll be presented
with a new course work
engineered to boost
state exam performance,
as mandated by
"no child left behind".
good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure to be here.
i've come today with some
edifying materials
to help your matriculating and
non matric students
to better prepare for the
upcoming state exams this may.
let me start by stating
i love teachers.
i love what you do,
what you stand for.
you guys are the real heroes.
now, the  one thing i've learned
in all my years in the private sector,
is that
real estate generates revenue
and burgeoning property values
will be this school's saving grades.
but your school's
low test scores
are bringing down the home resale
value in this neighborhood
during a market already in decline.
we gotta get scores up -
new families in our district
and more motivated
kids in your school.
and i'm not placing any blame
excuse me, are you here
to sell some test materials
or to air your concerns
as a property owner?
listen, umm ... i'm curious..
are you givin' away popcorn with
this crap that you're pushing?
this faculty has spent their lives
on the boards, and
you tell us
that our careers are
about re-sale value?
- bullshit !
- give him hell eadie ...
- storm the gate.
- don't oversimplify it, ma'am.
that's a hazard you
can't afford.
that sounds like a threat.
- could you please sit down?
that's enough.
could you please sit down?
can we have some
order here, please.
dr. hart was right.
- your school's the pride of
the district. - yeah, you bet pal.
could you finish your pitch,
we'd like to go home?
what's you hurry, hon?
i hear they putting you out to pasture.
so enjoy running this relic
for a few more months.
you're a fossil and
you're fucking done.
you ever dread going home?
lately, i don't know what to do
with myself when i'm not in the classroom.
so, friday afternoons
i am afraid to go home.
afraid of all that time alone.
yeah.
- my mother hates
my father passionately...

...on a permanent basis
...the only time that i don't feel
- i teach for selfish reasons...
- my mother was in mac madisson
...i need a control
- i need those kids more than...
- its the moments in school...
it must be like
...best teacher i ever had...
so what's your story?
my story?
i'm just.. .um.. i'm just taking it
one thing at a time.
why are you wasting your life?
you know subbing's a dodge.
i teach every day, i mean...whaddya mean?
i mean you don't really know me.
so what happened to you?
-......uh..happened
you don't want something
more permanent?
- hi
- where have you been?
what? i was out.
- with a colleague.
- boy or a girl?
a woman.
you make me feel so stupid.
why do you treat me like a kid?
- well you are a kid.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
i wasn't expecting this.
all you had to do was tell me
you were gonna be home later.
look back up, alright?
i'm not beholden to you, okay?
i mean, you're welcome
to stay here, but
you know, you don't get to
have expectations of me, alright?
this is a temporary thing, you ...
you're able to stay here, but ...
eventually you're gonna
have to go, you understand thst?
- i think it is important...
- it's clear.
i get it, you want
me to go now?
i got better things to do
than clean up this dump.
i can't believe you made dinner.
with what?
groceries, from the grocery store.
wow, it's ah..  it's really nice kid.
it's been long time since
somebody's cooked me a home cooked meal.
thank you erica.
we all have problems, we all
have things that we're dealing with.
and we all ...umm
take them home with us at night,
take them to work
with us in the morning.
i think that helplessness, that
realization, that foreboding of
being adrift in the sea,
with no
no buoy, no safety net, when you
thought you'd be the one.
throwing the buoy.
hi...
- anything for dinner?
- tell me all about it from the beginning -
- you don't care.
- oh now ...
..that's so untrue my love.
you are so condescending.
give me a kiss.  hmm?
come on.
no more talking..will solve everything.
- come on
- stop it.
do you remember when
i bought you this?
that beautiful summer in venice
before our travels were
resigned to reviving old passions.
- is that me?
- yeah
- grandpa, you doing any writing
of your journal? - no...
i don't remember much.
i lost the habit. you
can't think in this place.
you can't make new memories.
thank you.
- you alright?
- what?
- you see me?
- you see me standing here?
yeah, i see you, yeah
oh god, its so relentless.
thank you. thank ..thank you.
"carol, there's no nice way
for me to do this."
"i spoke with the superintendent"
"he's agreed to let you ride
out the rest of the year "
" it is what it is."
"take your pension..go to that beautiful house of yours."
haven't you ever had enough.
haven't you ever just wanted
to tell someone to fuck off.
i think i'm sick.
- huh?
-  i crossed the line today.
i mean the whole...
the whole thing is fucked.
whole thing is fucked,
is it not?
what up, dr.parker?
can we get this over with?
i got shit to do.
ok, so what are your plans after high school missy
since you're not going to college?
i don't know.
hang out with my boyfriend.
do some modeling shit...
- be in my friend's band.
- well i have your 10-week grade report
you know what it says?
f, f, f, f, f.
- f, f, f yah.
you know what that means?
it mean you don't care.
you're brilliant.
can i go now?
oh god, you are a shallow
disgusting creature.
you want to know the truth?
one, you're not gonna be in a band
or an model missy,
because you have no ambition.
with no skills, you'll be competing
with the 80% of the u.s. workforce
for a minimum wage job
til you're replaced by a computer.
- i don't care
- two...
the only talent you'll ever have
is getting men to fuck you.
your life will basically
become a carnival of pain.
now, when you can't stand it
not one more day,
not one more hour,
it will get worse,
much worse!
every day i come into this office and
i listen to you kids shit all over yourselves!
it is so easy to be callous. it takes
courage and character to care.
not that you have any
of those qualities.
- get out! just get out!
get out! - fuck you!!!
- i am a total burn out.
- you are not.
- i am. - i mean i don't know how
you make it through the day.
come on, listen, seriously why do you
think i take these pills for?
i mean, that's a rubber room in there.
if i didn't take these things i'd be
committing mass murder on half of these parents.
and i'll be helping throwing their
fucking kids out of the window.
come on, you're the best.
i'll tell you my opinion, the worst
thing about this job
is that nobody says thank you.
- no.
- no.
well i am here to say thank you.
you're doing the job,
that none of us can do.
none of us.
- grace? - have i ever i told you
that you're the only person
i have to talk to.
- hi henry
- what happened?
they called to your house.
- your grandfather felt
some chest pains. - yeah?
the doctor says he's stable.
he doesn't have a lot of time.
- i am so sorry henry
- how long ...
...have you been here?
since this morning, i didn't know
how to get ahold of you?
i don't know where you work.
you've been here
all day with him?
hi, grandpa.
you're still hanging
in there, i see.
oh, hi sweetheart. your mother
was with me today.
did you see her?
- no. - i told her i was
afraid to leave you.
...but she promised
that she'd look after you.
- well, i'm sure she meant it.
- patricia, darling...
you've forgiven me, haven't you?
- what do you need to be
forgiven for, daddy?
- well, those things.
you know, the things i did.
- all you ever did
was take care of me.
- always looked after me.
- weren't you afraid of me?
no, daddy, not.
i know how you get sometimes
you get little mixed up.
you feel responsible for the
things that you didn't do.
so i wasn't the one
that hurt you?
no sir, that wasn't you.
i'd hoped it wasn't true.
patricia, darling.
i've always loved you.
daddy, you can feel free to leave,
whenever you're ready.
you know that?
it's okay.
there's nothing to fear.
come on.
let's get outa here.
is patricia your mom?
what happened to her?
she left a while ago.
you mean she died?
how did she die?
my father left when i was a kid.
i don't really remember him.
it was always the three of us,
mother and grandpa and i together
in his house.
i found her... on the floor.
she'd taken enough pills...so ahh
and grandpa on the moment,
kinda of lost it...
i sat with grandpa
on the porch, and
and we watched as they
came and took her away.
how old were you?
seven.
i don't know for sure,
but i...
think my mother was young
when something happened.
with her and grandpa.
- were you afraid of him?
no.
did she ever say
anything to you?
no.
but looking back on it, i think she
protected me in her own way.
how?
she made me lock
my door at night.
the park is now empty and bare,
with an abandoned chain about it
the jungle jim, the slide and
swing  have rusted together.
they're all so terribly alone now.
where did all the children go?
didn't they know that
the park needed them?
a child's intelligent heart can fathom
the depth of many dark places.
but can it fathom
the delicate
moment of its own detachment?
- hi mr. barthes.
- hi meredith.
- how's it going?
- fine, i..
- i made a picture for you.
come here.
- you did?
- yeah
wow, it's beautiful, and it's a...
you're really talented.
- thanks. have you been
doing this for a long time?
yeah, i've been doing it
since i was a kid.
a faceless man in an empty room.
is that how you see me, meredith?
i don't know how i see you.
it's just how thought
of you in a situation.
do you ever think about who
your teachers are on the outside?
- in real life?
- i guess so, yeah
- does this place seem unreal to you?
- i watch you around the school,
you always seem so sad
like..maybe you have a hard time with things
and you need someone to talk to
- meredith
- yes sir
- do you need someone to talk to?
- yes, will you talk to me?
when you talk to me, when you look
at me, it's like you really see me.
i do see you meredith
- do you wanna go
see dr. parker?
- oh come on, don't blow me off with the guidance counselor
i am not, i am not ...
what can i do?
it's like you said, we're...
there is nothing left. nothing but
to realize how fucked up things are...
it's not enough. i won't last.
listen to me. just listen.
we're all the same.
we all feel pain.
we all have chaos
in our lives.
life is very, very
confusing, i know.
i don't have the answers,
but i know if you ride it out
it'll all be okay.
- mr. barthes, do you like me?
- of course i do.
- meredith, please don't.
you know i'd like to help you.
- please, please.
- no, no.
- you don't ...
- you said you liked me, please...
please, please...
oh please,
don't push me away.
please, just hold on to me, and tell
me that everything's gonna be o.k.
everything is...
it is okay, please.
- please... no, no...
- meredith, wait a second.
- what's going on?
- what?
- meredith, meredith
- what were you just doing?
meredith, i am sorry.
- what were you doing?
- what?
what are you doing?
- excuse me?!
- you were just touching her.
what do you ... what are
you insinuating?
it is inappropriate to be in here
alone with that young girl.
it is inappropriate?!
she needed someone to talk to.
- what do you think i'm doing, huh lady?
- i don't know what you're doing.
"just hold me close."
what do you think i'm a fucking pervert?
is that what you're insinuating?
she needed someone
to talk to her.
- well, then why were you touching her?
- i wasn't touching her.  you fucking....
"i'm sorry my dear."
"patricia?"
i'm not ... not some sick old man!
is that what you
think of me?
is that what you think?
i just wanted to help her!
- get out! excuse me! excuse me!
- what am i supposed to think?
you're supposed to...
fucking so.. fucking judgemental!
hello, no he's not home.
hello mr. barthes.
ahh, whenever you feel like you're ready
we do uhh have some paperwork downstairs
that we need you to
take care of.
i'm sorry.
i wish things were different.
i tried, huh you know... fuck..fucked up thing
thing is..that.. we all...
we all have problems. we all
have things that we're dealing with right?
some days were better than others.
somedays were not so great.
some days we have uhh...
limited space
for others.
hey. don't be impressed. i made breakfast.

something else.
they don't need me.
- you ok?
- yeah, i'm not hungry.
- you know, you can't...you can't
keep living on the street.
i am not. i mean, i'm staying
here with you.
well you..you can't continue
to stay here with me.
- i mean, i'm not good for you.
- that's not true.
you're the only family
i've ever had.
why, i can't be your family.
i can't give you what you need.
- you have to understand,
you should be... - you are good...
and gentle ...
you're the most kind.
i love you henry.

- you gonna be okay.
- no! no! no!
no! ...
well ... i feel
just awful for her.
- for who?
-  our school.
it may sound baroque, but i have always
felt that the school had a spirit.
it's not just an bunch of old buildings,
but they're alive.
i..i just don't understand it.
where are all the parents? hmm?
i don't know.
i was in my room for two
hours and saw one parent.
where are they?
where is everybody?
- we don't know.
- it's uncanny.
no air raid sirensl
no bombs.
it doesn't happen that way.
it starts in a whisper,
then nothing.
we had our music once,
didn't we?
yes, we did.
-ahh
hey, do you remember those nights
when we had two parents at a time?
and then there were more,
there were many more
waiting in the waiting rooms. -um hmmm.
and halls were full of joy and
celebration. now, it's nothing.    -ummm
rememberance. the things passed.
i actually felt quite at home.
but there were no parents.
heheh
i thought how appropriate.
it was like, a moment of insight
into the reality of the fucking
problem in the first place.
some of us... believe that
we can make a difference.
and then sometimes we wake up
and we realize we've failed.
hi, this is gretchen
calling from the free clinic,
erica louis' test results are back.
please give us a call
at your earliest convenience.
thank you.
" - you have good parents "
" - bitch you shut up. "
"a mother of mine gave her ... "
" ya dyke bitch! "
" ha ha...ha ha ... ha ha"
" what is all this supposed to be?
your tortured soul?"
" - i won't last!"
".....fucked up things are...."
"are you picking a fight?"
" - paint something more cheerful ..."
" we have to pay us our lives ..."
" grow like your hair, lost some weight"
" it'll all be okay "
- good morning!
- good morning.
before we take roll,
i want to tell you that umm.. today
will be my last day with you.

announcement from the principals office.

by ten minutes, thank you.
ahem......i invited you here today
to discuss the state of things.
i know that there wasn't a...
i know that there isn't ...
- i'm sorry ...
- we all need something,
to distract us from....
complexity and reality.
no one wants to think about
where that came from?
no one wants to think about
the struggle that it takes
to become somebody
to get out of
... to get out of the ...
the sea of pain that,
we all have to get out of.
- hi meredith.
- hi.
haven't seen you
in class lately?
well, where have you been?
- baking.
- i see.
-yep
- i am happy i get to see you.
today is my last day.
how ironic.
listen, i umm..i was thinking,
i bought this for myself, but
maybe you could umm.. make
better use of it.
- i like that one the best.
- you can't have that one.
it's mine.
but, you can have this one?
- it's better for you anyway.
- thanks.
i'm sorry.
if i hurt you
in any way, i um ...
i know....... that its tough
right now, for you,
but it's not always gonna be this...

they say that suicide is a permanent
solution to a temporary problem.
i'll let you know.
my name is meredith and
i wanted to kill myself.
meredith!
no!
henry!
it was gonna be o.k.
it's gonna be o.k.
it was gonna be o.k.
we have such a responsibility to.... guide
our young so that they don't end up
falling apart.
falling by the wayside.
becoming insignificant.
i realized something today.
i'm a non-person, sarah.
you shouldn't be here.
i'm not here.
you may see me,
but i'm hollow.
we're failing.
we're failing.
we failed in a sense that we
have let everyone down.
including ourselves.
when you're walking down
the hallway, or in your class,
how many of you
have ever felt the weight
pressing down on you?
hmm?   i have.
everyone?
wow!
poe wrote about these
things over a 100 years ago.
so, as we read
we can see that
"the house of usher"
is not merely an old
decrepit castle in disrepair.
it's also a state of being.
" during the whole of a dull, dark and soundless day "
" in the autumn of that year, when the clouds
hung oppressively low in the heavens, "
" i had been passing alone, on horseback, "
" through a singularly dreary tract of country, "
" and at length found myself as
the shades of evening drew on, "
"  within view of the melancholy house of usher "
" i know not how it was "
" but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of
insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit "
" i looked upon the simple landscape of the domain "
" upon the bleak walls, upon the
white trunks of decayed trees "
" with an utter depression of soul "
" there was an iciness "
" a sinking,....."
" sickening of the heart. "
" detachment "
