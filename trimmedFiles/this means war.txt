well, l met a sweet girl
she blew my mind
and we've been hangin' out
ever since that time
we got good love
rock 'n' roll
oh, yeah
sweet, sweet love
here we go. so the coretex
has minimal damage.
there's some calcining
around the edges.
however, the tempolite has damage
and there's rusting around 300 degrees.
so that means the coretex
gets the recommend.
see, em? the best product always wins.
oh, lauren.
yes.
l was just wondering if l might skip out
a little bit early for the holiday weekend.
jerry's taking me to an alpaca farm.

of the heinrich case...
...were clearly indicated

hey, lauren. lauren. hey, hey.

hey.
lt's steve.
yeah. oh, my-- l'm so sorry.
uh, lauren, this is kelly.
lauren: hi.
kelly: hi.

how they're supposed to, didn't they?
yeah. yeah.
yes.

okay, well, you know what?
l'm gonna go because
l'm gonna go meet my guy, ken.
steve: huh.
uh, he's a surgeon.
wow.
so, great, well...
...um, congratulations

oh, thanks.

...and your bikes and everything.

[ln unlson]
sushi for one.
[ken speaks ln japanese]
hey, ken.
[ken speaks ln japanese]
the usual?
yeah.
[speaklng ln japanese]
long day, huh?
you don't know the half of it.
[groans]
[door jlngles]
[speaks ln japanese]
steve:
this is too funny.
hysterical.
l'm sorry. this must be
your boyfriend's seat. uh, ken, right?
oh, yeah.
ken: no.
sushi for one. yeah. always for one.
lauren: ugh! it was the most
humiliating moment ever.
well, because you have to come up
with, like, better excuses.
you should've been, "l have a fiancé too.
but he's getting a penile reduction...
...because his penis is so big
every time it lands like a poltergeist."
can't think of anything
when l see him.
l just can't believe
l gave up everything for him.
lt's just, l felt so stupid.
l left my friends, my family--
don't say that, l'm happy you moved here.
we have a happy life together.
he was my person.
he was your person. you know
what kind of person he ended up?
the person that ends up with a girl
that makes out after she eats yellowtail.
l like sushi. she seemed really nice.
she was really pretty.
well, l don't give a shit about her.
l give a shit about you and your love life.
l'm going out, dating, meeting guys.
oh, please, you're not-- you date,
but you're not taking it seriously.
don't use that brand, it leaves a film.
that one's much more effective.
l wish you would act like that
with men.
you can choose a laundry detergent,
but you can't choose a guy you want--
that's my job. lt's easier.
there's charts, there's numbers.
that's why you start online dating.
they have lots of charts.
not that again.
what is your problem with online?
what's my problem?
do you watch dateline?
how many creeps are out there?
l could end up a skin suit
or in somebody's trunk.
uh, that's a little dramatic, okay?
that happens to, like, one in 20 girls.
you're not gonna end up in a trunk.
lf you're lucky...
...somebody will end up in your trunk.
that's your trunk.
ha, ha. stop.
you need to get back out there, okay?
yeah, sure, you might make a mistake
and end up with the wrong guy...
...but you might end up meeting
the right guy. so isn't that worth it?
what is the worst thing
that could happen?
skin suit. skin suit's pretty bad.
tuck: thank you for having me
to your nana's.
fdr: are you kidding me?
you're my best friend. we're family.
oh, my god.
this is gluten-free. try a taste.
hm?
why the heck are you two
sitting over here all by yourselves?
you're not gonna make me
any great-grandbabies this way.
lt is a family gathering, nana.
l don't think you want us
making any great-grandbabies.
to be fair, l have already provided you
with a wonderful great-grandchild.
yeah, but that doesn't count
because you screwed it all up.
ouch.
come on, lil.
let's show these kids
how it's done, huh?
heh, heh. see?
ciao.
lt's kind of gross when they kiss.
[fdr hummlng]
god, l love that kid.
what's going on?
hey, mr. deep-ln-thought.
you wanna talk about it?
l was just-- that kind
of thing's lovely, isn't it?
lt's really lovely.
what's lovely?
l love the way they look
into each other's eyes like that.
l'm pretty sure that's the cataracts.
have you-- okay. you asked me
a serious question, didn't you?
yeah. yeah.
right. so do you want a serious answer?
yeah. put the cake down?
please.
okay.
thank you.
cake is down. talk to me.
well, no, seriously, man chat. okay?
okay.
man to man.
l trust you.
l know you'd do anything for me.
yeah.
you would take a bullet for me.
l would for you as well,
you know that. right?
can you imagine all of that?
yes.
can you imagine what that would be like
to share with a woman?
no.
okay.
no.
thank you.
[whlstllng]
max:
all right, joe, steven, you're up.
[speaks ln japanese]
all right, joe. good luck, son.
let's go to war.
that's it. now you feint.

oh, nice. get on him. oh!

get on him. ground and pound.
ground and pound.
uh....

joe: l give.

that's how it works, boy.
boy:
see that? l pwned him, didn't l?
tuck: good. you okay?
max: sure did, son.
ha, ha!
that's how you kill him.
what are you doing here?
well, l had a bit of time off and
l thought l'd come hang with my homey.
l got creamed.
no, you didn't,
that's just a matter of opinion.
what do you know about fighting?
you're just a travel agent.
l know enough to know
that he who hesitates--
[growls]
pain?
that's just weakness
leaving the body.
joe:
oh, dad.
joe. joe, joe.
woman: come on, boys.
boy: mom, did you see me win today?
woman:
on the mat? that's amazing.
hey, guys.
tuck: hey.
hey, bud.
hi.
hey, tuck.
hey, how you doing?
didn't know you were in.
got a couple days off
so l thought l'd come see joe.
you're the only travel agent l've ever met
who actually travels for his job.
yeah.
um, so l was thinking that maybe, um....
maybe you, me and joe,
we could all go out together...
...you know, as a family,
maybe get something to eat.
have a meal. l think
that would be really, really good.
l have a date tonight, tuck.
so maybe some other time.
sure. that's great. good. that's good.
bye, joe.
so good.

you're not watching my date.
l need a little privacy.

because your voice is amazing. ha, ha.
l feel like l need to apologize again
for that bizarre profile.
no, no, no.
my friend, trish, is....
oh, no. everybody should have a friend
who's a spaz.
l think l'm going to have to kill her.
well, actually...
...l might be able to help you.
l'm kidding.
so am l.
frankensteln [on tv]: love...
...is the only thing
that can save this poor creature.
and l am going to convince him
that he is loved...
...even at the cost of my own life.
no matter what you hear in there,
no matter how cruelly l beg you...
...no matter how terribly l may scream...
hi.
[cell phone rlnglng]
frankensteln: ...do not open this door
or you will undo everything l've worked for.
good for you, pal.
so tell me one thing
that's not on your profile.
um....
l have a son.
oh, you do?
yeah. he's called joe.
he's 7 and he's really lovely.
really lovely.
and his mom?
couldn't work.
how about you?
no kids that l know of.
okay.
and no ex-wives.
l have a very important question to ask.
good. go on.
have you ever been or do you
ever plan on being a serial killer?
well, l mean, it's--
you gotta keep your options open.
but, no.
okay, good answer. ha-ha-ha.
[both laughlng]
so you've never killed anybody
with your bare hands.
not this week.
great.
lauren, you're incredible.
you're not so bad yourself.
all right, l'm gonna go and rent a movie
and take a cold shower.
l will too.
okay.
and wait for your call for the next--
five minutes?
[laughs]
henry [on tv]:
this is where it all started.
yes, i was standing over there
by that desk.
martha: no, you were sitting in the chair.
and suddenly, you started walking toward me.
very slowly. very slowly.
i could count every step.
and when you're walking towards me
very slowly...
...l thought, "what's the matter with him?
can't he walk faster?"
oh, l'm so sorry.
oh, l'm sorry. you take it.
no, no, no, that's okay. you take it.
sure?
you're not gonna like it. twist ending.
you'll see it coming a mile away.
and how would you know what l like?
l know movies. and women.
really?
mm-hm.
okay.
well, then,
why don't you tell me what l want?
the lady vanishes? why is that?
mm-hm.
well, firstly, you can never go wrong
with hitchcock. ever.
lt's got comedy, drama, romance,
it's a thriller.
lt's classy, but not stuffy.
a little obscure, so if you haven't seen it,
you'll thank me for introducing you to it.
lf you have, you'll know
what a good choice it was.
well, l have seen it.
mm-hm.
and it is a really good choice.
mm.
however, not as good as rebecca,
notorious, vertigo...
...or pretty much any of his films
from 1 960 to 1 972.
ln fact, it's sort of a second-tier title.
a second.
you know what? scratch--
look, l see you surveying the prospects.
that one over there in foreign?
too much angst.
this one in the sweater set,
picking out animated movies?
that girl will have your children named
before breakfast.
the problem is,
no one looks like a clean getaway.
l get it. you come in here
looking for a girl renting a movie.
clearly, she doesn't have a date
for the night. we're easy targets.
you look like the guy
interested in a one-day rental...
...if you know what l mean.
lf you knew anything about women...
...or anything about me, l'm perfectly
capable of choosing my own movies.
but thanks.
happy hunting.
hm.
man: so, sir, you want me to hack
into a video store database?
fdr: lt's for the heinrich case.
computer volce: searching database.
fdr:
all right, keep on scrolling.
wait. stop. scroll back.
that's her.
sir, how is this girl
connected to heinrich?
that's g-4 classified.
hello, everybody, l'm lauren scott.
thank you so much for being here today.
all:
good morning, lauren.
we're here today to talk about grills.
does anybody have any first impressions?
l like the rotisserie feature.
perfect. that's very helpful.
fdr:
l don't think it heated up fast enough.
like something was wrong with the motor,
maybe the spark was dead.
actually, sir,
there's nothing wrong with the spark.
some people think grills
just burst into flames at the slightest touch.
lt doesn't work like that.
does anybody have any useful opinions?
l thought the lid was hard to handle.
mm-hm.
ugh. the lids, what a pain, right?
l just felt the whole thing to be a bit stiff,
uptight, not really user-friendly.
l think it depends on the user.
mm.
lt so happens l have
a lot of experience with grills.
l'm something of a grill master.
uh, this is a sophisticated grill. not sure
you've dealt with one of those before.
or maybe a grill like this
is just so scared of being burned...
...it stays on simmer
and never really heats up all the way.
don't touch my grill.
l don't think this can handle a guy like me.
l think it could.
really?
easily.
prove it. 8 p.m. barcelona. tomorrow.
l don't think so.
l guess l could stick around
a little longer, talk about grills.
charcoal or gas,
number 1 9, what do you think?
lf l say yes, will you leave?
this is my job.
eight p.m. tomorrow.
fine.
fine.
fine.
[snlffs]
you smell nice.
bye.
what were you doing
on the computer? porn?
l have a photograph of my girl.
l was doing the same thing.
a background check.
l don't know if that's creepy or romantic.
"cromantic." l do it all the time.
wanna see?
yeah, sure. wanna see her?
yeah.
l bet yours has got antlers and howls.
she does, but she's
incredibly attractive with them.
she's a 1 0.
go on three.
one, two, three and go? all right.
okay. l'll sound off.
okay.
one...
one.
...two, three.
that's, uh, lauren s--
lauren? lauren scott?
scott.
that's the girl from the video store?
right around the corner from the bar.
oh, wow. um....
l had no idea.
of course. how could you know that?
did she, ahem, actually say she wanted
to go out on a date with you, though?
you know what? l'm gonna make this
really easy. l'm gonna bow out. you date her.
hang on. did she say
she wanted to go out with you?
lt doesn't matter.
l love you. you're my best friend.
yeah.
you go date her.
yeah, if l got in the picture,
it wouldn't be fair.
well, l'm sorry. what does that mean?
[slghs]
what does that mean?
l mean, come on, man...
...you're not out there
as much as l am.
and like anything...
...practice makes, uh....
perfect?
no, no, no.
you're perfect?
maybe not perfect,
but damn near close...
wow.
...to perfect.
you believe that as well?
you don't have to bow out because of me.
l don't?
l'm not concerned that she's gonna
fall in love with you, pal.
how very nice of you. thank you.
you are welcome.
so do your thing.
whatever that is.
and, um...
...just let her decide.
sure.
yeah.
yeah.
while we're at it,
why don't we put ground rules in?
we should.
one, l don't think...
...we should tell we know each other.
two, stay out of each other's way.
three. yeah.
no hanky-panky, no hanky-panky.
god, you have not dated
in a long time, have you?
and if this ever starts
to affect our friendship...
which it won't.
...which it won't...
..then we walk away.
done.
so, then, we have-- we have--
we have a gentleman's agreement.
a gentleman's agreement. we do.
may the best man win.
the best man for her.
for her.
for the lady.
for the lady, for her,
the best man for her.
[opera muslc playlng over speakers]

ln that case,
l'd like to have a suit in this fabric.
ah, south american vicuña.
an excellent choice indeed.
one thing with my suits,
l like to know they are one of a kind.
l wouldn't want anyone
wearing the same suit.
l'm sure you understand that.
of course, sir. with this fabric and color...
...l only made one other, and that was
for a gentleman who lives quite far away.

my best event was the keg stand.
you're a gymnast?
unbelievable.
lt's valid. you said you were a gymnast,
l asked a question.
that's exactly why l'm walking away.
because you're uptight
and don't know how to have good time?
you have the emotional intelligence
of a 1 5-year-old boy.
you think l'd be interested in going out
with you or going back up in the club?

you owe me an explanation
for whatever that was.
okay. you're right, l do.
yeah?

let's go.

okay.
so l packed up my entire life
and l followed him out here.
and then six months later,
l found him in bed with a pilates instructor.
he's just not the guy l thought he was.
l made a mistake.
l don't believe in mistakes.
well, that's a very convenient philosophy
for someone like yourself.
lt's the mistakes
that make us who we are.
they led you here, right?
would you rather be back
in atlanta right now?
no, not really.
they led to your job,
you like your job.
l love my job.

no, no. l mean--
our munich office got a hit back on one
of heinrich's men from hong kong.
name is lvan sokolov.
here's a surveillance file
from the dfs in mexico.
we expect he's trying to get heinrich
into the country through l.a. harbor.
chatter suggests lvan lives here in l.a.
now, flush him out.
she's definitely lost her sparkle.
all right, look, you flag lnterpol,
l'll call some of our contacts.
l really like this girl.
l really like her too.
no, l really, really like her.
so do l.
you do?
yeah, l do.
so you're not backing off?
nope.
okay.
then you ought to know that when
we went out on our date, lauren and l...
...we, um....
what?
what? what did you do?
we shared a kiss.
wow.
mm-hm.
[ln brltlsh accent]
lncredibly magical kiss with tongue.
oh, dear. wonderful.
you are an animal.
[ln normal volce]
look, pal, we kissed too.
lt was pretty special.
l don't think it will be the last.

we will see about that.

everything is important.
the last three guys she slept with.
who she was sleeping with last week.
you want us to take them out?
yea--
no.
no.
l'm sorry, but--
does this have to do with heinrich?
that's level 5 classified.
for my eyes only.
this operation is top secret.
don't let your country down, boys.
roger that.

because she was f-t-f-o.
which cryptography department believes
means she was freaking the fuck out, sir.
l s-h-l-t you not.
l was l-m-f-a-o when l read that.
lt was crazy, ridiculou--
bothwick! s-h-h-h-h-h.
trish then called the babysitter
and told her it was an emergency.
this is serious. this is really serious.
can't believe this is my problem.
last month, l was dating boggle.
this month, two gorgeous guys.
l need you to stop making references
to boggle like a man. lt's a game.
and you sound like a woman
who has nine cats and knits her ass off.
you never said gorgeous. you said
good-looking. there's a difference--
wanna see a picture of them?
yes.
okay.
l didn't know you had pictures. give it.
oh. wow.
right?
that's dirty sex.
you know you're gonna have dirty sex
and it's gonna stink.
not like sex. l mean, like,
man stink, the good stuff.
that's pretty impressive. for you, yeah.
what does the other one look like?
lauren: youjust scroll over,
you do the finger thing.
trlsh:
oh, my god. he is hot too.
i am impressed with you.
this is hotness. that man is--
you scared the shit out of me.
you all right?
yup.
medically speaking?
fine.
lauren: they're people, not products.
you're not a very good liar, know that?
oh, yes, and you are.
lauren: they never play this game with me.
seeing as we're both here,
we might as well share resources.
lauren: incredible guys.
l don't have a choice.
please, sit down.
oh, l'm staying.
trlsh: okay, good, good.
well, l'm available as a friend.
lf you want me to have sex
with both of those guys...
...just to test out stuff and see who
comes back a winner and who doesn't.
they wouldn't know. l'd pretend l was you.
l'd put my hair up in a pony.
obviously l'm busy, because l'm a mother,
but l would carve out time in my schedule.
that's the kind of friend l am.
why is she listening to that old man?
l have no idea.
okay. you know what? that's not helpful.
okay, fine.
do one of your "focus groups"
you do at work.
you can be the focus group,
l can be in charge, like you.
lauren: oh, that's actually a good idea.
trlsh: okay.
this is good, l like this.
okay, so l will ask you questions
about the products.
okay.
the people.
and you tell me who you like and why.
lauren:
i don't know. they're both incredible.
what a struggle. l have to go home...
...and clean tartar sauce
out of bob's beard right now.
probably one of his testicles.
you're gonna talk to me
about how amazing these guys are.
ls there anything bad about them?
okay, let me think. flaws.
l think there--
there is one thing.
fdr has these tiny, like, girl hands.
like little t. rex hands.
ha!
trlsh: oh, gross.
means he's got a mike and lke
for a penis.
[laughlng]
you know that's not true.
you've seen it.
you've seen it in bangladesh,
you know that's not true.
and tuck is british.
mm.
what is that supposed to mean?
trish: doesn't mean anything.
that's the same, they're kind of even.
so get into decision-making mode.
and l need you to do it kind of quickly.
lt's fun, but l'm not the one having sex.
so l can't be that invested.
okay. you know what l need?
mm.
a joint. okay.
no, l need a deadline.
gonna give myself a finite
amount of time to make this decision.
that's good.
one week l have to make a decision.
trlsh:
one week?
okay, so she grew up in georgia.
she likes to volunteer at dog shelters.
she's a fan of classic rock
and collecting mini camaros.
what, as in the cars?
[lauren screams]
lauren:
this is so fun!
you're a natural in this.
lt's just so weird.
my dad used to collect these.
they were never as nice as this one.
but he never let me drive them.
l can't possibly imagine
why he wouldn't do that.
[torpedotrlckser's "what l got" plays]
she's got a magic spell on me
did he just give our bird the bird?
now i've got a woman
what was that?
what? well, that was the exhaust.
oh.

lavender bath salts.
and she collects posters
by gustav klimt.

you know, like that:
yeah, no, of course l have.
ls this what l think it is?

yes.
the harpist, 1895?
l have this--

pre-secession movement.

two- and three-dimensionality.
the tension between
two- and three-dimensionality.
lncredible. this is my favorite.
how do you know?
undine, 1902.
oh, my goodness, this is amazing.
lnnovation became intrinsic....
to degas and other modernists.
you can see influence of art nouveau.
strong advocate
of the finger-painting movement.
what?
hey. we lost contact.
[ln amerlcan accent] sometimes he would
finger his paintings to get closer to them.
he, uh, used his....
he would--
the intimacy with the canvas
to finger a painting--
to--
[laughs]
rather to paint using hands.
sometimes,
he would use mud and sticks.
you know, he used mud
and sticks-- ahem.
he did?
lf he couldn't find a stick...
lf he couldn't find a stick...
...he would use his dick.
...he'd just use his--
what?
oh, son of a bitch. who is--?
ha, ha.
ugh!
you know, l think enough talking.
let's let the paintings
speak for themselves.
oh, my god.
wow.
that is so beautiful.
lt's amazing.
just incredible.
fdr:
yeah. lt is.
thank you.
trlsh: hello?

have some constitutional issues here.
patriot act.
trlsh: so how was it?
lauren: they're both incredible.
uh, fdr has these amazing eyes
that you just wanna melt into.
so beautiful.
he brings out the best in me.
he really challenges me.
but he's that guy who's always on,
he's superslick.
sometimes, l think he doesn't care
about anything more than himself.
[dogs barklng]
well, they say it's a sanctuary for them,
but it's-- here it is.
this is amazing.
lt's really more of a sanctuary for me.
hey, rebecca.
glrl: who's that man?
hey, betty.
excuse me?
l just had no idea you were
so passionate about animals.
yeah. animals and kids.
what's up?
how you doing, nick?
what?
there are a lot of things
you don't know about me...
...and it takes a while for me to open up.
l can see that.
[glggles]
oh, what's the matter?
what's the matter, you?
hey, little guy.
what's going on?
lauren: you okay?

a lot of dog hair.
yeah.
so....
l know.
big mess.
do you wanna help me pick one out?
you're gonna adopt a dog?
l think it's time for me to be responsible for
something other than myself, you know?
wow, l think that's so great.
okay.
let's pick the saddest,
oldest bastard here.
trlsh:
okay, what about tuck?
uh, tuck is great.
he's sweet, he's ki--
we have so much fun.
more fun that i've ever had
in my entire life.
but he's maybe too sweet?
a little earnest?
uh, sort of safe.
yeah. that's boring.
l almost fell asleep just listening to that.
safe.
okay, l think l'm ready.
you ever carried a weapon before?
you know--
not really, no.
okay. okay. l need you to keep that end
of the weapon well away from me, clear?
okay.
thumbs up.
this will be fun.
no.
lt's not fun.
lt's dangerous.

okay.
that boy come right out of nowhere.
okay, you are disturbingly good at this.
oh, yeah.

by random paintball people...
...l'll be safe.

l tried to get your back there.
l got off a few shots...
...but l think my triggering mechanism
was stuck.
you got the safety on.
l was trying to--
oh, you mean this thing here?
yeah. ugh!
oh, my god. are you okay?

the other day, we went paintballing...
...and he nearly put this kid's eye out
with a paintball gun.
then fdr,
we went to this animal shelter...
...and he adopted a 12-year-old dog
with a milky eye.
l'm telling you, it's getting weird.
l can't help but thinking
l'm putting them in this position.
lt's making them crazy.
lt's making me crazy.
so, what are you gonna do about it?
l have to do what any rational woman
in my position would do.
break up with them?
sleep with them.
sex tiebreaker.
oh, thank you! finally!
a sex tiebreaker!
that is what you need to do!
you have to have sex

the only thing you were worried about
getting fired up was lauren, wasn't it?
honesty, franklin.
try it.
right!
now, l have very serious
anger management issues today, lvan...
...so l would appreciate it
if you'd do me the courtesy...
...of answering
all my terribly boring questions...
...sharpish.
heh, heh. the pliers, really?

what are you, garry kasparov?
lt's not like that. lauren's been asking
about them, and you know nana.
once she heard l was dating someone,
she got excited. she wanted to meet them.
l don't believe this.
what?
this is not a play to one-up you.
they're my family.
yeah, but they're my family too.
yeah, but they're my actual family.
wow. yeah. ahem.
of course they are.

oh, those are his parents.
they died when he was 9.
l'm so sorry.
he never told me that.
yeah.
ln a car crash. they were going out
to dinner one night and, um--
well, he's never been
quite the same since.
he has a hard time
trusting people.
but he must trust you.
because you are the first girl
he's ever brought here.
l have a hard time trusting people too.
[all laughlng]
he had the biggest blue eyes,
like marbles.
which almost made up
for the bed-wetting.
[all laughlng]
nana. we really don't have to talk
about that right now.
oh, we really do.
no, no, no.
no, we should.
no, no, no.
we ought to.
l know--
he wore that superman costume
everywhere.
you wouldn't believe the smell.
but how were we to know
that he would take it so literally?
the little fellow jumped off the roof.
oh!
l was given misinformation, okay?
we all make mistakes.
that was one of mine.
yes, but remember, franklin,
there are no mistakes.
[nana glggles]

[both laugh]
ha, ha. l should go.
yeah.
l should be a gentleman.

but after last night,
l can't see tuck now.

l don't think so. get out there, you get flexible.
l'm going to hell.

sorry.
okay.
what's happening to me?
tuck: you have
absolutely no self-control.
tuck, look, l didn't plan
on this happening, okay?
she's the one that initiated it
in the first place.
well, of course she initiated.
you roll out the big, happy family,
it's like girl porn, isn't it?
you broke the rules, man.
forget the rules. not a game anymore.
l care for lauren.
great, you have affections.
lt only took you 30 years.
tuck.
what?
l slept with her.
yeah, well, l'm well aware of that, aren't l?
no, slept. fell asleep.
that's never happened
to me before.
okay, so he wants to play family, so we'll
play families. we can play families. right?
all right. uh, yeah.
good, let's play families.
l don't know what that means.
lt means get me a family.
right, so you got your aliases.
back stories.
charming anecdotes.
yeah? great. grandma, if you could pull out
a few tears when you're telling that story...
...of how l rescued the blind children from
the well, there's an extra 50 in it for you.
right. ladies, mental gents,
l shall see you at 1 300 hours.
l am so glad you could make it
on short notice.
yeah, l'm happy to be here.
and they are going to absolutely love you,
and you will love them.
l'm excited.
so am l. god, you look gorgeous.
they should be here.
l'm going to give them a ring. you mind?
oh, not at all.
okay.
okay.
you look gorgeous.
here we go boys. here we go.
lauren: hi.
man: there she is.
lauren: how are you?
good. you?
supposed to be here
three minutes ago.
boyles:
i don't understand. they should be there.
yeah, well, they're not, are they?
okay, let me find out what happened.
ha, ha. so, finally. right?
lauren: yeah.
oh, bollocks.
so has he told you?
what?
how he got his name. "tuck."
no, he didn't.
oh, not his given name. not at all.
"tuck." unusual, right?
lauren: yeah. yeah.
woman: oh, here he is.
hi. your dad was just telling me
how you got your nickname.
hello, son.
hello, dad.
woman: hello.
tuck: how are--? unh-- unh-- unh--
oh, my good--
woman: mm-mm.
[laughlng]
jolly good. right.
right, we're just getting to it.
old tuckers comes down one day.
l don't know, he's 10 or 1 1 ,
wearing a dress.
hikes it up and goes, "oh, look.
l've got me naughty bits tucked under."
hence, "tuck."
"l'd fuck me. l'd fuck me."
"what's wrong with this boy?"
but it doesn't matter because, like, we're
just so proud that tuck is into girls again.
man: finally.
because for a while it was all egyptian men.
yeah. "oh, gotta have it
coming and going. please." whoo-woo!
choo-choo train.
"come on, boys, have at it.
lt's the navy."
ahem. l think we should order.
lauren, tuck really is, like,
a really great brother.
he is.
he saved me from becoming a swinger.
before tuck stepped in, everyone in our
village used to call me "the sausage wallet."
"tsw." that's a shakespearean term for slut.
man: right.
where did you find her?
so, what's going on with your bits up top?
heard they weren't real. they look real to me.
tuck said they were fake.
what?
l did not. l wouldn't say--
"these knockers. oh!
can't wait to get into them."
l wouldn't say that.
man: you did. why you lying now?
yeah, but they look quite nice.
not as big as these bazookas, but. . ..
tuck: wait, is there a waiter?
you know what, actually,
l forgot l have a commitment at work.
lt's been very nice meeting you all,
but l have to go.
man: you want something to go, then?
no, thank you.
wait, can l get your cell number?
lauren: god.
lauren.
bring up six.
bringing.
tuck: sorry about that.
that was the weirdest five minutes of my life.
l'm sorry. those people back there,
they are not my parents.
what are you talking about?
they're not my parents.
those are not your parents?
no.
l wanted you to think that l had
a perfect family, so l hired some people.
you hired people?
yes.
you hired what kind of people?
actors. actors.
tuck, this is just bizarre.
l don't know what to say about that.
l don't have any parents.
l have no family.
what?
l thought it would impress you.
okay? that's why l hired some, because
l thought that was normal. l thought--
but you have a family. you have a son.
yeah.
okay, the truth about joe is that
my relationship with joe is really awful.
lt's really awful.
when he was a little boy, it was great.
he was a puppy.
he loved me to bits. then he grew up,
now l can't reach him.
he doesn't want anything
to do with me, at all.
okay? so l didn't want you to see that.
lt's actually very embarrassing.
so l thought l'd hire a family,
because l thought that was normal.
right, look, l totally understand
you needing to walk away...
...because if l were you,
l'd walk away too.
but l think-- l needed to level with-- yes?
tuck.
lt's just l was really
looking forward to today.
lt's just been a lot, and l think l should go.
lauren, l really want to get you home safe.
okay, so joe's is just on the way.
let me pick him up,
and then l'll drop you straight off after.
okay.
thank you.
[school bell rlnglng]
boy:

tuck:

and that's why
l've completely fallen in love with you.
damn. l think
that's the new british lnvasion...
...what happened there,
that's what that was.
lauren: l feel like l'm having a panic attack.
breathe.
breathe in and breathe out,
and come sit down.
do you think it's possible
to love two people equally?
love, yes.
be in love, no.
what do you do
when you don't know what to do?
l ask bob.
your husband, bob?
"bob" bob?
yeah.
l mean, l know he's fat and ridiculous,
but he's my fat...
...and my ridiculous.
and l like the way that l am with him.
boy: mom, could you fix this?
hey, buddy.
don't choose the better guy.
choose the guy that's
gonna make you the better girl.
right?
boy: right.
fdr:
l love you?
pretty fancy words to get the girl in bed.
bravo. well done. good performance.
l don't expect you to understand.
why can't you just admit you lost?
l didn't. l was doing well until you turned up
with your big hair and your white teeth.
as per usual.
let's not forget, yes, l did find her first.
yeah, but she fell for me, tuck.
she fell for me. lt's not my fault
you're always a step behind.
lf l'm only a step behind,
it's because l'm cleaning up after you.
do you know what?
l couldn't give a monkey
who lauren chooses between us.
but this, what we had....
yeah, what?
lt's over.
l already asked collins for a transfer.
[cell phone beeplng]

l was the only thing keeping you alive
in kandahar, mate.

no, l'm fine.
l was gonna tell you.
that's why l asked you out.
yeah, it's okay. l, um....
