[typing]
[typing continues]
[thud]
[wind whistling]
oh, my god. stuart.
what is it?
tom's grades finally posted.
- [typing continues]
- look.
[stuart]
wonderful. not one "a."
no.
ora "b."
mm-mmm.
- not even in health.
- [typing continues]
what the...
that was just a "d."
- [woman]
how are these changing?
- [typing continues]
[thud]
one word, and you're dead.
[grunts]
are you crazy?
if dad catches you,
he's gonna kill you.
dad's not gonna catch me.
[kisses fingers]
- mwah!
- i don't get it.
what do you see in that guy?
bye, babe!
you mean, other than the fact
that he's good-looking, sweet,
sensitive, romantic, funny
and ridiculously athletic?
- dad's coming, and he's mad.
- at who?
tom.
[stuart]
tom!
- what?
- if you're smart enough to
hack into the school web site,
then you are smart enough
to pass math.
do you think bethany
got accepted to michigan
by screwing around all the time?
of course not.
she got in 'cause she's perfect.
no. your sister worked
her tail off, and that's
exactly what i expect from you.
yeah. you're right, dad.
l-l-i don't deserve a family vacation.
i should stay home tomorrow,
learn my lesson.
oh, no, no. i am not
taking that bait, kiddo.
this isn't you.
the bad attitude, the grades.
what is going on?
nothing.
i blame all this
for coming between this
right here.
some good old-fashioned
no-tech—
[equipment powering down]
uh—
family togetherness
is exactly what we need.
so get some sleep.
we're hitting the road
at sunup.
oh, and you guys too.
[grunts]
[laughs]
hannah. please, next time,
you ride the hump, okay?
i barf in the middle.
remember?
[man on radio]
and that's the farm report.
in other news, it looks like...
there will be more
than just fireworks
in the sky tonight...
as an unexpected meteor shower
adds a little excitement to our area
this holiday weekend.
- very exciting. we're in
for a little bit of a show.
- that'll be beautiful, guys.
better wear hats tonight.
we don't want our heads
catching on fire.
[phone beeps]
wow.
- hey.
- your boy toy
is a complete idiot.
ricky is not a boy toy.
- we're in a mature,
loving relationship.
- [groans]
why don't we talk
in a few years when you have
a clue what dating's all about?
- like ricky has a clue?
- one more word about ricky,
and i swear to god i'll kill you.
- [horn honks]
- okay. that is enough.
knock it off, you guys.
we're almost there.
[animal chittering]
[birds tweeting]
and there's the pool.
see ya!
we beat uncle nate!
oh, yeah! ha-ha!
ah.
i got it, tom. don't worry.
nice, huh?
great, yes. i'll grab that.
i hope there was a discount
for booking us into the most
boring spot in the whole country.
we're only a stone's throw away
from at least a half dozen
top-notch fishing lakes.
are we near a time machine
so we can go back five years
to when i thought fishing was cool?
hey, i bought us all
new sidestab reels.
anti-reverse technology.
lame.
[door squeaks]
[groans]
so lame.
[sighs]
[radio: rock]
nice landing, nate.
[stops]
told you i could
fishtail this thing.
nice try, nate,
but you just missed my kids.
but he did almost give
your mother a heart attack.
- again.
- nana!
hi, mom.
oh, hi, darling.
nana!
yes, sweetheart!
ooh!
[kissing]
i got you a little treat.
you did?
yes, i did. here we go.
[laughs]
thank you.
[games bleeping]
[nana] oh, it's so good
to see you. i missed you.
hey. we're here.
[bleeping continues]
well, one of the pearson
brothers came to party.
are those
even legal here?
no. [laughing]
here! come on, stu!
let's get him!
- nate, stop it! i'll tell mom.
- tickle him! tickle your uncle!
spin him faster, nate!
[nate laughing]
get his shirt off!
[stuart]
mom!
[cell phone beeps]
[nate]
aw, stuey's crying for mommy!
twins, in here.
hey, guys.
put my bags on the bed.
sir, yes, sir.
- trying to be a wise guy?
- no. no. definitely not.
don't provoke him.
good. now, get these
out of here.
whoa, whoa, whoa. wait a minute.
why do you get the best room?
i was here first.
- i'm here now.
- i'm older.
and i'm bigger.
did you... grow
since christmas?
two inches, cuz.
i can tag a stop sign
without even having to jump.
[chuckles]
how's mathletes?
i don't do
mathletes anymore.
- you tired of getting beat up?
- [stuart] tom!
get down here
and help us unload! now!
close my door
on the way out.
[radio: dance]
[continues]
- surprise, surprise, princess.
- ricky, what are you doing here?
oh, i'm just stopping by
for the afternoon...
or maybe the night.
[tires squeal]
[stops]
- what's that?
- what's what?
- ricky!
- hey! mmm!
whoa. watch out
for the car.
i can't believe you're here.
well, you're
my girlfriend now,
so there's nothing
i wouldn't do for you.
[laughing]
now, give papa
some sugar.
bethany. please
don't give papa sugar.
mr. and mrs. p!
- ricky, wow!
- hey, ricky! what a surprise.
i got you a little
housewarming gift.
oh, that is so sweet.
isn't he sweet?
yes. they're beautiful.
those are gorgeous.
yeah. very patriotic
too, huh?
let's stick the flags
in some water,
see if they grow.
i know. we can do that.
do you want anything
to eat or drink?
oh, that is so sweet of you.
i really wish i could.
but my parents have
a lake house in oakstown,
and i gotta get back before dark
in case my car breaks down again.
uh-oh. car trouble. hmm.
dad, why don't you take
a look at it for ricky?
yeah, i don't mind
getting my hands dirty.
try it again, ricky.
[engine grinding]
[tom]
it's gotta be
something obvious, dad.
i got to be honest with you.
auto mechanics isn't really
my thing.
now, if this were
a spreadsheet or a ledger,
i would be all over it, but—
- [chuckles]
- i'll tell you what, ricky.
stay here tonight,
and then we'll take your car
to the shop in the morning.
mr. p, that's really
considerate of you.
well—
really?
he can stay the night?
- [stuart] yeah,
in the den, on the couch.
- [bethany] of course.
no fooling around.
[bethany]
dad.
what a gas pipe.
i know.
why can't they see that?
well, dude, parents
are wired differently.
their brains are old, mushy,
fried from bad '80s music.
that's why it's up to you, thomas.
you gotta defend
your family honor, like a man.
i call it the punisher.
your dad bought you this?
perks of divorce.
never underestimate the power
of a grown man's guilt.
if we even mention mom,
nate drives us straight
to the mall. [chuckles]
she's all yours.
don't be a wuss all your life.
uh— i don't know, man.
take a look at that guy.
do you really want ricky
as your brother-in-law?
waah, waah, waah.
heck, no.
then let's go prune
the family tree.
i had so much fun last night, ricky.
oh, yeah? well, you know,
that's just the beginning.
[chuckles]
man, the sun off the water and...
this lightweight cotton...
is... so... constricting.
i hate cotton.
[chuckles]
mind helping me
with the lotion, babe?
i'm thinking shooting
my sister's boyfriend isn't the best idea.
this isn't about ideas.
this is about action.
don't think. do.
i can't believe
i'm even listening to you.
you're dressed like a shrub.
- just a little on my chest.
- target is on the move.
- take him out before
he reaches second base.
- nah. i don't think that—
[screaming]
[yelling]
[screams]
[yelling]
- why did you do that?
- shut up. you'll
compromise our position.
[yelling continues]
oh, my god. she saw us.
what do we do?
what do we do?
camo mode.
hunker down and blend.
[grunts]
- i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
- you shot my boyfriend.
"sorry" doesn't
even touch that.
when, tom?
when are you gonna
grow up and stop being
a total embarrassment?
and that's
why we use camo.
shut up, jake.
[thunder rumbling]
ooh!
are you
gonna be okay?
[stuart] i don't know
what you were thinking.
i really don't.
yeah, i'm gonna be all right.
a paintball gun.
this was a good idea though,
miss smarty-pants.
that's a gateway gun.
[laughs]
how about what's next?
b. b? pellet?
stun? what am i gonna do?
what do you think i should do?
i don't know what to do.
can't you
keep him in his room
for the rest of the week?
- but it wasn't even me.
- okay, you boys are just lucky
that ricky wasn't badly hurt.
it's okay, mr. p.
i was a little kid once too.
oh, that's nice, ricky.
thank you.
he's a good guy.
he's a good guy.
but, no, i'm not okay with this.
look, we're up here to fish,
not to hunt your sister's
boyfriend, all right?
you could have put his eye out.
would that have been funny?
i don't think so.
all right, let's start over
with a clean slate.
tomorrow, we fish.
- you're kidding.
- pass. nate?
yeah, stu. don't you think
that's a little early?
how about this?
no questions asked.
way to crack the whip, nate.
way to crack the whip.
[thunderclap]
[objects crashing]
oh, stu. stu.
natey, the tv's gone haywire.
stu, tv's gone haywire!
- [cane banging tv]
- mom. mom, stop it.
it's probably the dish.
after the storm,
i'll climb up on the roof
and fix it.
hey, wait a second, mr. p.
let me fix the dish, man.
that's the least i can do
for your hospitality.
- no, ricky. you're hurt.
- oh, no. it was just a graze.
oh, no, honey. he's fine.
go ahead, richard.
show some hustle.
yes, indeedy.
but i will be needing
a helping hand.
so what do you say, brother?
give us a chance
to bury the old hatchet.
make things right with ricky,
or don't come off that roof.
uh, ladies first.
whoa.
whoa.
total creepshow.
all right. here we go.
listen, about
that paintball thing—
oh, hey.
don't even worry about it.
firecracker! too slow.
[laughs]
you know what?
thanks to your little,
uh, sharpshooting stunt,
i racked up pity points
with your parents,
and big sis is just itching
to be my private nurse.
so thanks a ton, ace.
that was a textbook
wingman move.
come on.
quit stalling.
get your butt up there
and make me nana's hero.
but you told my dad
you'd fix it.
aw, well, i told your dad
a lot of things.
like my car broke down,
my parents own a lake house,
i'm 18.
you-you're not a senior?
not in high school.
- now go.
- [scoffs]
go.
there you go.
[laughs]
[wind whistling]
[object clatters]
hello?
[wind whistling]
[laughs]
dude, you make it too easy.
it's not funny.
what the heck
happened to the dish?
i can't do a week here
without tv.
i can't do
a week here, period.
[gasps]
whoa.
- [gasps]
- hello, hu-mans.
please tell me
you see that too.
not sure i want to.
but, yeah.
we come from upstairs!
whoa, whoa, whoa! whoa.
i handle human contact.
yes, sir. noted.
it's understood.
hello, humans.
[mumbling]
no need to notification army.
we come in pieces.
in peace.
what?
say it with me. "peace."
what are you talking about?
read the book. peace.
forget the book!
attack the humans!
attack!
with pleasure.
humans, submit.
[whirring]
- hey, what is taking
you girls so long?
- no, don't. no. no.
[thud]
[squeals]
- ricky!
- [alien chuckling]
- [tom]
what's happening to him?
- now the fun begins.
testing. testing. testing.
[distorted voice]
testing. testing. testing.
testing.
[laughs]
humanoid subjects,
we are the zirkonian species.
and we hereby claim
your luscious planet
as our own.
- [tom] wha— wha—
- you have the choice
of eternal enslavement or...
whoa!
whoa!
instantaneous death.
- run?
- i'm good with run.
- [jake, tom grunt]
- you have chosen
instantaneous death.
[alien]
the human grubs
are escaping.
- it's locked.
- not from me.
- we're trapped.
- duck!
- [grunts]
- unbelievable.
- razor, go!
- yes, sir.
[razor yelling]
- hey, can i play too?
- oh, hannah, thank god. open. hurry.
hurry.
[screams]
creepy-crawly!
no, no, no, no.
come back. come back!
- take them down!
- look out!
hey, frog-face!
what's with
all the noise?
- open the window!
- open it.
you open it.
no, you open it.
hurry! get them!
help!
someone, open it!
come on. right there.
- charge!
- hurry up!
move, twin!
everybody, downstairs now!
why?
just move!
[grunting]
- [grunts]
- creepy-crawlies.
- creepy.
- go, go, go, go, go!
get down! down!
- [grunts]
- [grunts]
- pull! pull! pull!
- i am! hurry!
- [grunts]
stupid remote control.
glorious commander,
be careful.
what's wrong with it?
fix it.
be careful!
[panting]
you a zombie?
no. you?
no.
prove it.
- what do you mean?
- i mean prove it!
you-you wet the bed until you were 10.
a zombie wouldn't know that.
- [lee] here they come!
- look out!
- ugly humans, submit.
get the rope.
[grunting]
- tie it off!
- i'm trying. push harder.
- oh, my god! oh, my god!
- [screams]
she scratched me
with her claws!
sorry, sucker.
[lee]
whoa. he cut off her nails.
we gotta call 911.
- i can't get a signal.
- neither can i.
mine's dead too.
- those midget martians
must be jamming us.
- never a good sign.
[dial tone]
it's working!
there's no buttons.
what is this thing?
it's a rotary phone.
you spin it.
[dialing slowly]
what happened up there?
was "get them"
not clear enough?
someone was
obviously distracted.
i was following
the plan.
you were playing
with your little toy.
this is a deadly weapon! it is.
no. these are
deadly weapons.
listen on yourselves.
this is why we lost success
on our mission previous.
not looking to blame throw,
but that one was razor's fault.
- what? you were the one—
- if we lose success this time,
i lose my command.
now, you're going to learn
to work together...
or we will together
end up shoveling manure
back in sector 7.
we won't
let you down, sir.
let's go enslave
some humans!
actually, uh, about that,
i'm sure enslaving is plenty of fun.
but why the hu-mans?
what?
they don't seem
that bad.
aw. rookie.
oh, "they don't
seem that bad."
funny. that's what
our engineer previous said.
engineer previous?
right before the creature
that was "not that bad" ate him!
[groans]
the humans are vicious.
peace is not an option.
[ringing]
[slurping]
[ringing continues]
sheriff here.
uh, th-there's an alien invasion
at our rental house.
- knee-high beings. very violent.
- knee-high. like a hobbit?
no. real. look,
i know this sounds crazy,
but you gotta understand—
okay, yeah, listen, son.
you do know making a fraudulent
complaint is a federal offense.
it's punishable—
[line clicks]
hello?
[electricity zaps]
hmm.
decent technique...
for a female.
[groans]
[grunts]
how's that technique?
[chuckles]
- hello?
- [dial tone]
we gotta tell our parents.
[thud]
[thumping]
[hannah screams]
think he's still
an alien zombie?
- you are useless.
- [hannah whimpers]
why aren't the mind-control
plugs working?
you're the engineer.
figure it out.
hurry up. hurry up.
hurry up. hurry up.
fix it!
[grunts]
fix it.
fix it now, you idiot.
he's not talking to us, right?
i think he's picking up
their conversation.
they had, like, a bluetooth.
what do you mean
their hormone levels
are too unstable?
are you telling me
the plugs only work
on mature subjects?
why did we not
plan for this?
you have failed me,
you incompetent piece of...
- deck.
- translation not available.
these humans will pay!
[body hits ground]
did you hear that?
yeah. sounds like ricky
landed on his face.
no. those things they shot at us,
they-re-they're mind-control plugs.
they won't work on kids.
it's like you said.
we're wired differently.
wha-what about ricky?
it tagged him
and he's bethany's age.
no. he lied. the tool's in college.
so if their plugs
don't work on kids—
that means we're safe.
it means we can fight 'em.
it means they'll
go after our parents.
they're walking targets.
we got
to tell 'em. now.
whoa, whoa.
wait. think.
if our parents even go
near those things, they'll
get zapped and end up zombies.
our own parents will attack us.
we need the police and
their hard-core firepower.
oh, armed zombies. even better.
- we're done. game over.
- game over for the grown-ups.
but we can still fight back.
so you expect us to stop
an alien invasion on our own?
he's right.
we're the only option.
but we can't tell anyone.
no police, no parents,
no exceptions.
got it?
hannah?
they're up in the attic
right now, little aliens.
they're loud and scary
and really mean.
- han, there's
no such things as aliens.
- yes, there is. i saw them.
they smashed the skylight
and tried to break the attic stairs.
well, let's hope not for your sake.
we put a huge deposit on this place.
so you boys better
keep it in one piece.
- you heard her, tom.
no more trouble.
- it was just a video game.
we shouldn't have let her watch.
it's rated "t" for "teen."
it's teen violence.
tommy, i'm scared.
i don't like the mean aliens.
don't worry, han.
just pretend it's a big game,
a game that we're gonna win.
- just think about
how little they are.
- little and deadly.
- [art]
what do we do now?
- we figure out their weakness.
they flew here from another galaxy.
you really think they have a weakness?
first rule
of the warrior code—
all enemies have a weakness.
sparks, why isn't
my locator map up and running?
i told you.
i need parts to repair it.
you're not helping—
[electrical surge]
[yells]
- aha! even on earth,
the male is dominant.
- ah.
[grunting]
[tazer]
aha. oh.
- wait.
- ah. but the female
always wins.
what the...
by the rings of zirkon.
huh? that makes no sense.
they were fighting.
now their lips are hugging?
i would never.
never.
ne-ver.
oh, i'm sorry.
can i get you anything?
a cold drink?
some snacks? hmm?
or would you rather
help me invade a planet?
[grunts]
all right,
recon's my specialty.
i'm going up.
- i'm coming with you.
- tom, be careful.
[squeaking]
enemy... apprehended.
- [clears throat]
i'll interrogate.
- ah!
[crunching]
[rat squeaks]
- [belches]
- [both groan]
ah. disgusting.
what? seriously, what?
locator activated, sir.
excellent.
target the objective.
zoom in. zoom.
zoom.
zoom, zoom, zoom.
- [sparks] you don't have
to keep saying "zoom."
- zoom. zoom.
and... rotate.
[tom]
i think they're after
something in the house.
let me get a better look.
stop.
- [yells, grunts]
- rotate. ah.
the basement.
- tom, help me!
- ah.
[both yelling]
- that must have hurt.
- [groans]
basement.
we gotta get to the basement.
ricky?
ricky!
oh. hey, guys, wait.
have you guys seen ricky?
uh, pretty sure he's still
hanging around here
somewhere.
actually, beth, uh—
he didn't leave, did he?
no, no. he, um—
he told us he was
heading back to the lake,
uh, to, bronze up
his rock-hard abs.
yeah, he wants you
to meet him there.
wait.
what did you guys
talk about on the roof?
did he say anything about me?
no. no, no. he—
he talked about his car.
and, um—
but pre-pretty much
just his car.
um, but you should hit
the lake so he doesn't think
you're blowing him off.
yeah, the lake.
over there.
it's probably good there.
i'm telling you,
their map led down here.
you positive?
shh. you hear that?
rice krispies.
[popping, crackling]
[popping, crackling continue]
[crackling]
what is that?
[crackling continues]
it's them.
something down here's
setting it off.
well, whatever it is,
we can't let 'em
get to it.
everyone, gear up.
we move on my command.
now, just hold on.
if we run up there
with a bunch of random junk,
we're gonna get creamed.
we can make something better.
we're in the middle of a battle,
and you wanna play science fair?
no way.
we're going back in now...
before our parents
end up as alien zombies.
you're not thinking.
we need a plan.
i already have
a great idea for a weapon.
really?
[chuckles]
let's go.
now.
hannah,
hand me that tape.
what's up, nate?
[lee]
hey, guys!
[art]
hey, nana!
who wants a treat?
[laughs] whoo.
that's a lot of tools
to try to fix the tv.
[thumping]
they're busting through.
the warrior code says
strike first.
art, cover me.
with the rake?
[yelling]
how do you feel now?
suckers!
mission accomplished.
oh, god.
- oh—
- crud.
[laughs]
it's a dud.
[whirring]
what the— whoa!
- whoa! what's happening?
- why are we floating?
they turned off the gravity,
like in halo.
this isn't xbox, lee.
it's real. like wii.
[lee]
now what are we gonna do?
[art] i don't know.
stay behind me.
- no! don't! don't!
- [lee] there's no gravity.
hello, hu-mans.
[laughs]
enjoying the ride?
[grunts, yells]
[art]
they have gravity boots.
- [lee] why don't
we have gravity boots?
- "they have gravity boots."
[jake]
the door! stop 'em!
use your weapon, tom!
- bring it, meat sack.
- [jake] today!
a potato gun?
that's your big idea?
- my plan is working.
- my plan. you mean my plan.
hurry, tommy!
oh!
[grunts, coughing]
[coughing continues]
ooh.
[yelps]
- [coughing]
you okay?
- i'm fine. the door.

jake, get the grenade!
- ah.
- hurry!
quick! toss it here!

[screams]
sock monkey.
oh! ha!

[grunts]

shoot him! shoot him!
- [lee] go, go, go!
- [art]
shoot him!
- ouch! ow! ouch again!
- buttocks on fire!
- [panting]
whoa. that's the thing
they used to control ricky.
- whoa!
- [beeps]
oh, cool. let me see it.
oh, nice action
on the toggles.
wait. what are these?
give it back. let me see.
- i picked it up first.
- [back cracks]
- give it back.
it's mine.
hey, hey, hey, guys.
this is not a toy. it's real.
[thud]
- [jake] ricky?
- yep.
get him before
somebody finds him.
i'll stand alien watch.
i'm sure that'll
buff right out.
[laughs]
wonder where he went.
oh, i'll find him.
[beeps, whirring]
whoa.
[chuckling]
cool. so these move him.
and these...
operate the arms.
- talk about the ultimate game boy.
- [slapping]
- [laughing]
- what does that big button do?
whoa! what the—
my car!
[beeps]
that would be
the on-and-off button.
- press it again.
- [beeps]
car!
who did this to my car?
you did,
you giant idiot.
[beeps]
[bethany]
ricky!
- where have you been?
- [beeps]
oh, shut up,
you little b— bethany.
- what?
- ah!
- why are you hitting me?
- why are you being such a jerk?
- huh?
- revenge is so sweet.
i just spent the last hour
walking around the lake.
where were you?
- uh— l—
- that's what i thought.
no. l-i don't know.
[laughs]
want me to bring him back?
babe, please don't
be mad at me.
[bethany] did your brain
fall out of your head?
let him suffer.
where's ricky?
taken prisoner
by the aliens?
no. worse. my sister.
any action up here?
it's been quiet.
too quiet.
[thumping]
[skip]
no talking in here. got it?
what are they doing
in the vents?
their map. that's how
they'll get to the basement.
what do we do?
i hope this works,
einstein.
i didn't get to thank you
for pulling me to safety back there,
because i didn't need you to.
uh, that doesn't
make sense.
i don't like you.
shh. stop talking.
good to know.
okay.
[grunts]
hmm?
hmm. sweating?
[sizzles]
[grunts]
hot! ah!
hot! hot! hotter! run!
[all yelling]
fall back! fall back!
ouch! ouch!
[all yelling]
sounds like they're mad.
[yelling]
nice job.
i think it's working.
[stuart]
kids, get down here right now!
who turned
on the heat?
i did.
um, we need that on.
are you crazy? it's july.
yeah, but it's...
it's freezing in here.
ooh, yeah. ooh, arctic.
yeah. i think hannah's
coming down with something.
[coughing]
what's going on?
we're fighting aliens.
i'm pretending it's pretend.
i mean, it is pretend.
okay, but i'm not pretending,
so don't touch the thermostat.
tom, i'm not
playing around.
neither am i.
tom, i'm not kidding.
you wanna spend the rest
of the week in your room?
why can't you at least trust
there's a reason i'm doing this?
a reason why you're
blasting the furnace
on summer vacation?
yes.
a reason why you shot
your sister's boyfriend?
- yes.
- a reason why you're talking
back, giving me attitude?
failing your classes?
so that's what this is about?
i failed them on purpose.
yeah, i tanked my grades, okay?
i'm tired of getting picked on
because i'm a brainiac.
i was a brainiac.
it worked for me.
i don't wanna be like you.
i wanna be cool.
don't touch
the thermostat.
is that true?
you really fail
on purpose?
nobody likes a mathlete.
man, we can't fight these things
with our parents around.
we can’t just get
rid of 'em.
maybe we can.
here's what i want you to do.
send it.
i hate it when we fight.
aw, i can't fight
someone as cute as you.
well, i'm glad we made up.
well, it's not an official make-up
without the make-up kiss.
easy. my family's up there.
and your family's crazy about me.
what about you?
well, you know i like you.
and we have
the whole summer
ahead of us.
maybe we don't have
to go so fast.
what? what?
[screams]
is that a "no"?
ricky!
careful.
don't break him.
ricky!
better grab his shirt.
ricky!
[lee]
still no sign of 'em.
where are they?
two options.
we're dealing with a retreat
or a surprise attack.
[laughs, snarls]
- [gasps]
- surprise attack.
hey, where's tom?
i thought he was
gonna help you.
so did i.
[ricky]
bad news.
the leasing office called.
they need you to go back there
before they close for the holidays.
- really?
- problem with the contract.
they insisted.
ricky, are you okay?
oh, um— um—
- just allergies, mr. p.
- just allergies, mr. p.
but they did say it's urgent.
urgent?
ah. okay, i'll call
and i'll sort this out.
that's so weird.
oh, this is weird, stu.
i think the phone's dead.
did they just
cut off our power?
oh, they are gonna
hear about it from me.
let's go. we are
going down there right now.
hey, guys, uh, we can use
some more beer, some chips.
why don't you run
to the grocery store?
i'll fire up the grill.
- and watch the kids?
- okay, whatever.
[chuckles]
- no.
- no.
i mean,
you all have to go.
they said all your names
are on the lease.
[ricky repeating tom]
- i'll look after the kids.
- i don't know if that’s
a good idea.
[nina] no. that'd be...
well, l— i guess
i could drive.
oh. um— okay.
- okay.
- oh, and, mr. p,
while you're out,
can you get me
some adult diapers?
mine are almost full.
mine are almost full.
that is a bad allergy.
oof.
[ricky]
super absorbent.
look. alien death mist.
don't breathe.
- put him on "pause."
- [beeps]
[grunts]
happy fourth of july,
space maggots.
jake, there's
smoke in the vents.
it's me.
we have unfriendlies on the move.
i tracked them down and held 'em off.
- nice.
- parents?
- gone.
- nice.
now we can take it
up a notch.
[firecracker lands]
[explosion]
[aliens screaming, shouting]
this could get ugly.
hannah, go hide.
yeah. seek safety.
not you.
incoming!
duck!
[all shouting]
[jake]
sayonara, suckers!
oh—
crud.
[screaming, shouting]
my arm! my head!
they got me!
[footsteps running]
go, go, go, go!
[groaning]
i'm starting to see
why the last engineer...
[screams]
[thud]
- [screaming]
- [screaming]
- [groans]
- [panting]
i see you've booby-trapped
your room.
got it. got it.
ooh! don't got it!
ingenious human snare.
[grunts]
ow.
[grunts]
[laughs]
- [slams drum]
- oh, wow. i thought i was clumsy.
it's okay. don't worry.
i come in peace.
it's okay. i'll help you.
don't worry. trust me.
it's okay.
[sighs]
oh. ow.
oh.
you've got a boo-boo.
don't move.
oh.
okay?
thank you.
tazer. razor.
sparks. sparks!
[groans]
he's critical to mission.
[tones sounding]
nice sounds.
it's music.
[slides over all keys]
ooh, music. i try?
sure.
[rock and roll]
yeah!
we've definitely slowed 'em down,
but those buggers adapt fast.
we need to pull out
the big guns.
black cat whistler
or fire dragon?
how about not
burning down the house?
[hannah, sparks laughing]
[sparks chattering, gasps]
[jake]
he's armed! enemy armed!
hannah,
step away from the alien.
no! leave him alone!
he's my friend.
he was just holding a ray gun
to your head.
it's my bubble blower.
he fixed it for me.
he's not like the others. look.
first sign of aggression,
i'm taking him out...
with extreme prejudice.
i don't have training for this.
no training.
- it's okay, mr. snuggle lump.
- snuggle lump?
yeah, that's what
i named him.
my name sparks.
- he's not your pet, hannah.
he's a freakin' alien.
- [shudders]
he's my alien.
hi.
[gasps]
aw.
i mean—
[groans]
maybe she's right.
i mean, look at his belt.
i think those are tools.
hey, it's okay, buddy.
we just want to talk to you.
come on, snugs.
back up.
uh— oh.
watch.
[hum resonating]
[laughs]
- [lee] awesome.
- [art] how does he do that?
[laughter continues]
[groaning]
what the heck was that?
talking about feelings
comes with the territory
when you have a girlfriend.
there is no loophole
for that one!
okay. okay, i get it.
you're not gonna talk
when i'm yelling. i'm sorry.
it's not mature of me to shout.
look, i am so, so happy
being your girlfriend.
but if you really care about me
the way that i care about you,
then it shouldn't be a problem
to give me the time that i need.
maybe you need to think about it.
and i can respect that. okay?
take all the time that you want.
[exhales]
i'll be here, ready to talk.
with you.
[scoffs]
so-so that's how it is?
i'm getting the silent treatment?
who is in high school now?
[slams]
- whoa. whoa.
- why are you trying to kill us?
- what's the invasion plan?
- [jake]
what's your weakness?
water?
earth germs?
- women?
- are there more of you coming?
- [jake]
we need the information.
- l—
guys, don't be mean.
han, we have
to interrogate him.
do you want the world
to end? do ya?
no.
[blows]
[all]
whoa.
house here.
mission objective here.
what you're after
isn't in the basement.
it's under the basement.
- [sparks] yes.
- what are you trying
to steal from our planet?
who says it's from our planet?
look at that thing.
it looks alien to me.
it must be from their planet.
- mmm. [gulps]
- yeah. planet fruitcake.
- [sparks groans]
- [art]
whatever it is, it's huge.
[humming]
almost done.
[tom] so, that's
what's in the capsule?
ah.
some kind of giant machine?
oh, great. a giant
alien death machine.
no one said anything
about death.
i doubt it's a photocopier.
come on! we can't trust
this four-armed freak.
he's one of them.
he's not.
this guy doesn't fit in
with the others.
he's... different.
- mmm.
- great. a geek alien.
jake, he's not a geek.
it's better than
a killer alien.
[bubbling]
mm-hmm.
[beeping]
buenas noches, wrinkles.
[stuart]
oh, this is ridiculous.
[sighs]
well, this sucks.
- modified.
- whoa.
sweet.
sweet.
[siren chirps]
[sparks imitating chirps]
[chirping]
sorry. huh?
[siren wails]
- it's the po-po. be cool.
- be cool?
[nana knocking]
open up!
oh, crap.
we forgot about nana.
open the door!
hold on. hannah, quick.
hide your alien.
open the door now!
snugs.
get in!
hold on a second.
children of my children,
i request entry.
i have candied sweets.
don't open it.
that's not nana.
are you sure?
- [growls]
- yeah, i'm sure.
surrender
engineer sparks now.
- nana— nana—
- out of my way, earth children!
move!
nana, don't make me
hurt you.
nana, uh—
[screams]
ew!
return him to me.
[jake]
tom, do something!
[skip gasps, screams]
[gasps]
- ew. gross human.
- [doorbell ringing]
someone's gotta
get the door.
- we can't let the cops in here.
it's too dangerous.
- here's nana!
hey! leave my nana alone!
silence, squeaky-voiced
human child!
[gasps]
i got nana's controller!
free me! free me,
or face the consequence!
in here.
you don't trap me!
i trap you! why, you—
shake all you want.
we own you.
[grunting]
the suitcase! go!
[karate yell]
ha! you missed me.
stand still, earth burgers!
[gasping]
ha! got him!
[hannah]
don't let 'em take
snuggle lump!
[lee]
art, wait!
- [tazer]
shoot him! shoot the humans!
- [jake] incoming!
- [tazer] shoot 'em up!
- [jake] hit the deck!
- you lose.
- [razor] zirkon forever!
i'm sorry, hannah.
i'm sorry. they got him.
- sweet, huh?
- very nice.
this is the creek landing
sheriff's department.
open this door at once,
or i will begin forcible entry...
in 10, nine,
eight, seven, six...
you guys get rid of the cop.
i'm going after the aliens.
five, four—
- we can't leave him up here.
- two, one.
i don't know how much you kids
know about penal codes,
but making phone calls
with the intent to annoy
or harass is a serious offense.
it's called criminal mischief.
and it could mean six months in jail.
emergency calls only.
- any misuse of this system
compromises this county's...
- oh, weapons.
only line of defense,
and that's me.
around here, i am the law.
literally, i'm the only one.
my deputy's on maternity leave.
look, sheriff, we told you we're sorry.
it won't happen again.
so, really,
you can leave now.
we'll be good.
oh, i can leave? okay, we got
the whole problem solved.
hey, what's that there?
[device beeping]
squadron, come in. come in.
do you have sparks?
no.
ah! is there any job
you two can't screw up?
[groans]
come in!
i'm sorry. i apologize.
that was uncalled for.
you're still trapped
in that box, aren't you?
yes, i am.
- step aside, young man.
- no need for that.
it's just my sister's robot dog.
it's sound activated. right, han?
right. it's not an alien.
mm-hmm.
you know what? i'm gonna take
a look inside that chest,
so please step aside.
[horn honking]
it's the po-po. be cool.
one hour. we're gone one hour.
what happened?
what'd you kids do?
hi. nina pearson.
are you kids okay?
is everything okay?
[sheriff]
no, ma'am.
i'd say making a fraudulent call
to 911 about an alien invasion
is most definitely not okay.
- you called 911?
- [nate] come on, buddy.
i'm sure you can let
these kids off with a warning.
look at 'em.
one, not your buddy.
two, notice that your vehicle
is missing a front license plate.
- three, how about
i write you up a ticket?
- how about you don't?
nate, stop talking.
you people usually leave
your children unsupervised
like this?
no. no, not at all.
we had to go into town
to the leasing office.
they shut our power off.
[sheriff]
looks all right to me.
[nina] sheriff, i know
this isn't something
to be taken lightly,
but honestly,
they are really good kids.
why don't you stay
and see for yourself?
we're barbecuing.
- join us.
- mom—
thank you, ma'am.
i'd like to, but i am on duty.
look. the kids made a big
mistake. and i assure you,
tom will be punished.
but my wife is right.
we got plenty of great food.
why don't you stick around?
i know you're on the job,
but there's no law against
a home-cooked meal.
got lots of hot dogs,
hamburgers, steaks and—
[tazer]
hmm.
okay.
[growls]
[neck muscles crack]
i have to admit,
it has been a while.
- all right.
arm successfully twisted.
- [stuart] great.
i guess an hour off
won't kill anyone.
- no.
- [laughs]
gotcha.
hey!
huh?
[grunts]
[laughs]
oh.
what was that?
- what was what?
- i don't know. i felt something.
- come on, everyone. dinner.
- let me help you with the bags.
inside.
i've got the desserts.
[grunting]
- you're going down, punk!
- you're going down, punk.
i just said that.
i just said that.
- stop that.
- stop that.
[laughs]
you've been punked.
[laughs]
hail zirkonia.
[grunts]
ow!
okay, now hold on, mom.
i'm not following.
now, what happened?
one moment
i'm cleaning my chompers,
and then the next thing
you know, i'm down here.
[nina] you know,
you're entitled to a few
senior moments at your age.
i'm sorry, sweetie. i forgot.
did you want cheese on your burger?
no. i want to find whoever invented love
and hack him apart with a machete.
boy trouble.
that makes two of us.
- i don't know what to do
about this tom situation.
- we have a guest. happy face.
- hey, nate, where's jake?
- i have no idea.
[stuart]
well, dinner's almost ready.
how about you track him down?
jake's an adult.
if he wants to eat,
he'll come down and get it.
oh, sorry.
that will raise welts.
excuse us.
no. pardon me. oops.
watch your head.
mmm-mmm-mm.
i tell you, there's nothing
more american than
a charred chunk of meat...
hittin' your stomach.
[all chuckle]
i bought the pickles.
oh, really?
if you think a dill spear
is gonna get you out
of that ticket, it's a no-go, mister.
[skip growling]
[grunting]
uh—
my stomach. i'm starving.
- [art] any word from jake?
- still no signal.
- where is he?
- hey, boys. none of that at the table.
right, nate?
they're playing
with their phones.
[stuart]
oh, yeah. slap it on.
hey, hannah, did you
eat all the hot dogs?
no.
[sparks belches]
i mean, yes.
[sheriff] gotta tell ya,
this sure beats eating
ramen noodles in my squad car...
every day by myself.
[growls]
[tazer]
comfortable up there, earth boy?
[razor]
hope so.
enjoy some dirt in your face.
[muffled]
help!
attention, all.
resistance is futile.
give me what i need.
oh, baby.
i knew you'd come back.
step aside,
hormonal female.
wait.
you're calling me hormonal?
back away.
you are irrelevant
to my mission.
irrelevant?
i don't care how old you are.
you can't talk to me like that!
what is going on?
teen drama. l-i think.
it is teen drama,
right, ricky?
- snuggles!
- [lee] turn him off.
- it's not me.
- [hannah] snuggles!
- let's move. bring nana.
- whoa, whoa. freeze.
- you kids have not been excused.
- [beeps]
let them go!
we're playin' a game,
uncle stu— i mean, stu.
we're on vacation.
am i aging backwards?
yeah, i don't think so.
you really want to deny me
my time with the kids?
[sighs]
wow. guilt never gets old.
well, go ahead.
i think we oughta keep mom
out of the pinot grigio.
[gulps]
you have lost. and now
the invasion shall begin.
invasion? you mean there's
more of you guys coming?
many more. and we
will crush you like bugs.
- not if we crush you first.
- i will not be beaten by children.
any more signs of resistance,
and the one you call jake
will be eliminated.
- i want snuggle lump back!
- that's it.
time to die.
- [whirs, beeps]
- richard?
you remember nana.
game on.
game over.
[knuckles cracking]
wow.
- whoa! what was that move?
- double right-thumb click
with a left-panel twist.
chinese get up!
- [growls]
- [object rattling]
he's on the light!
send nana after him!
- nana!
- lee! flying's your specialty.
[gasps]
ooh. take him out, lee.
- thumb cramp. thumb cramp!
- give it to me.
[glass shatters]
[ricky screams]
- ricky?
- what the—
nana?
[gasps]
[screams]
yes, scream, human,
for your species ends tonight.
[laughs]
what the heck was that thing?
space alien.
too much to explain.
we think they're probably here
to destroy the world
as we know it.
if we don't get down there,
we're gonna be in real trouble.
[nina] i'd say that's
the understatement
of the century.
- mom? are you okay?
- [remote beeps]
what— what happened?
how— how did i get—
oh, i need a glass of water.
uh—
okay. somebody better
start talking.
it looks like you guys had
a battle royal in here.
- we did. nana versus ricky.
- not now, hannah.
- dad, it's not what it looks like.
- all of you, upstairs, now.
- but, uncle stu, it wasn't our fault.
- now.
get up.
okay, unless
you wanna join them,
you better spill it.
what the heck happened
in here?
i haven't got a clue
as to what happened,
but my back hasn't
felt this good in ages.
[stuart]
mom? mom? where you goin'?
aliens.
build machine... now.
no.
[grunts]
[screams]
[laughs]
[tom]
i'm sorry, guys.
it's over.
over?
it better not be over.
ricky is down in the basement
with that... space rodent.
you don't get it.
an entire fleet of those guys
are about to invade.
well, man up and deal with it.
i have been... all day.
well, if he's too scared,
maybe you guys can help me.
- not without tom.
- why?
'cause he's our leader.
come on. it's not just ricky.
jake needs your help too.
and snuggles.
and, like,
everyone on earth,
including our parents.
all right.
let's go save the planet.
and your dumb old boyfriend.
you want monkey?
he's good luck.
i'm fine.
[banging]
[tom]
stay close.
they could be anywhere.
[gasps]
[screams]
[grunts]
it's jake!
those zirkonians...
they tied me up
and dragged snuggles outside.
this vacation really sucks.
you see the machine?
yeah. you were right.
it was sent here years ago.
some idiot built this place
smack on top of it.
guys? guys, i found ricky.
he's waking up.
where in the heck am i?
oh, baby, i'm so glad
you're okay.
whoa! don't touch me!
[mutters]
stop.
okay, okay.
i know it's been a really weird day,
but you have to let me explain.
okay. okay.
explain to me why i keep blacking out,
why i'm bleeding...
and why your grandma
did a flying ninja kick
on my face down the stairs.
okay.
we're fighting,
um, space aliens.
yeah. yeah.
okay, they're small,
but dangerous and—
and really scary.
oh, no. of course. i believe you.
why wouldn't they be?
why do you want to waste
our time playing hide-and-seek
and kill the aliens...
with your stupid brother
and your dumb little cousins?
don't talk about
my family like that.
well, you don't have to worry
about it anymore 'cause we're done.
i knew i should have stayed home
and hooked up with annie filkins.
she's smokin' hot,
and she doesn't like talking
about feelings all the time.
i'm goin' straight to annie's.
ow.
i'm really sorry.
don't be.
you were right all along.
if it's any consolation,
he's not going straight to annie's.
or anywhere for a while.
wow.
guys? enough of
this sibling bonding.
we're at defcon 1 here.
[whirring, beeping]
go. go! rookie.
[art]
oh, my god.
they're forcing him to build it.
build what?
how do you take over
the world with that thing?
i really don't want
to find out. we gotta stop
them before their fleet arrives.
- fleet?
- this is just the advance team.
- we have to rescue
snuggle lump.
- snuggle what?
lump. the foreign fella.
he's on our side.
the other three...
not so much.
- this is so not happening.
- we gotta get out there.
let's move.
not so fast. i have a plan.
work with me here.
did nana give anyone mentos?
why?
hand 'em over!
- what, we're gonna
throw candy at them?
- no.
my own little
science project.
mentos bomb.
you're a genius.
you shouldn't do this.
humans friendly.
whoa!
[skip] incoming!
[tazer]
in my eyes!
- [jake] let's get 'em!
- [tom] move!
[grunting]
- snuggles!
- traitor.
release me.
never mess with a girl
who just got dumped.

and switch back to my world
you're out of this world
i'm sure of it
a little more than different
and you keep lacking
lacking concern for it
it's you that i am missing
and then you switch right over
it's weird
yeah, i know
but just can't get a hold of myself
hey, so strange
you switched in front of me

how can i find you
staring at the stars falling behind you
across the universe
hope you'll be back soon
i gotta find a planet for me
i'll rearrange it

you switched in front of me
