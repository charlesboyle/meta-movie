he was an irritation
before he took power...
<i>he was a problem when
he was in power and he's been
a disaster for us in exile.</i>
he's writing a book about
the agency's history in africa.
he's going to name names.
<i>it's basically a shakedown.
he's demanding the agency's help.</i>
he wants us to put him back
in power in six months or else.
this interview, and i'll
make the tape available
to anyone who wants it...
he goes on to claim
that he's just survived
an assassination attempt.
<i>he says it's us.
he says he's got proof.</i>
the director wants to know
if there's any possible shred of truth
in this accusation.
<i>i've already assured him
there's nobody that reckless
on my senior staff.</i>

i said i was mr. kane's
personal assistant.
oh.

wombosi was assassinated
in his house in the middle of paris.
yeah, we just heard.
<i>it's him. it's bourne.
we're almost positive.</i>
he had an assignment.
he failed.
he obviously felt compelled
to finish the task.
<i>shit. jesus.
we think he'll
come back in now.</i>
i mean, it's routine.
it's like behavioral software.
he's following a protocol.
now that he's completed the mission,
we think he'll come back in.
<i>they always do.
when?</i>
how long
till he checks in?
twenty-four hours.
twenty-four hours?
yeah. it's usually
something like that.
then what?

we're past that now.
marie, listen to me!
the police will find us,

that picture in the embassy...
the people who killed wombosi...
they are gonna kill us.

we took her family's

the international calls.
<i>they were in paris
at 2:00 a.m.</i>

<i># too much can make me blind #</i>
<i>#i've seen so much in so many places #</i>
<i>#so many heartaches, so many faces #</i>
<i>#so many dirty things #</i>
<i># you couldn't even believe #</i>
<i>#i would stand in line for this #</i>
<i>#it's always good in life for this #</i>
<i># oh, baby #</i>
<i># oh, baby #</i>
<i># then it fell apart #</i>
<i>#it fell apart #</i>
<i># oh, baby #</i>
<i># oh, baby #</i>
<i># then it fell apart #</i>
<i>#it fell apart #</i>
<i># oh, baby #</i>
<i># oh, baby #</i>
<i># then it fell apart #</i>
<i>#it fell apart #</i>
<i># oh, baby #</i>
<i># oh, baby
like it always does #</i>
<i>#always does ##</i>
