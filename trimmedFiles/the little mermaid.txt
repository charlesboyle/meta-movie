a fine strong wind
and a following sea.
king triton must be
in a friendly-type mood.
- king triton?
- why, ruler of the merpeople, lad.
thought every good sailor
knew about him.
merpeople.
eric, pay no attention to this nautical nonsense.
but it ain't nonsense.
it's the truth.
<i>i'm tellin' ya'
down in the depths of the ocean they live' oh'</i>
<i>- aah'
- in mysterious fathoms below</i>
his royal highness,
king triton!
and presenting the
distinguished court composer...
horatio felonious ignacious
crustaceous sebastian.
i'm really looking forward
to this performance, sebastian.
your majesty.
this will be the finest concert
i have ever conducted.
your daughters--
they will be spectacular.
yes.
- and especially my little ariel.
- yes, yes.
she has the most
beautiful voice. hmm?
if only she'd show up
for rehearsals once in a while.
<i>ah, we are the daughters
of triton</i>
<i>great father who loves us
and named us well</i>
<i>aquata</i>
<i>andrina</i>
<i>arista, attina</i>
<i>adella, alana</i>
<i>and then there is the youngest

<i>she's our sister ari--</i>
ariel!
ariel, wait for me.
flounder, hurry up.
you know i can't swim that fast.
there it is.
isn't it fantastic?
yeah, sure.
i-it's great.
now let's get outta here.
you're not getting
cold fins now, are you?
who, me? no way.
it's just-- it, uh--
it looks damp in there. yeah.
and i think i may be
coming down with something.
yeah, i got this cough.
all right.
i'm going inside.
you can just stay here
and watch for sharks.
okay. yeah, you go.
i'll stay and--
what? sharks? ariel!
ariel, i can't-- i mean--
ariel, help!
- oh, flounder.
- ariel.
do you really think there
might be sharks around here?
- flounder, don't be such a guppy.
- i'm not a guppy.
this is great.
i mean, i really love this.
excitement, adventure, danger
lurking around every corner--
ariel!
oh, are you okay?
yeah, sure.
no problem. i'm okay.
oh, my gosh.
oh, my gosh!
have you ever seen anything so
wonderful in your entire life?
wow! cool!
but, uh, what is it?
- i don't know, but i bet scuttle will.
- what was that?
- did you hear something?
- mmm? i wonder what this one is.
- ariel?
- flounder, will you relax?
nothing is going to happen.
shark! shark!
we're gonna die!
oh, no!
you big bully!
- flounder, you really are a guppy.
- i am not.
<i>hmm-hmm, fourteen hundred
and ninety-two</i>
<i>dum-de-dum
do-do-do</i>
<i>rum-dim-dim
do-do-dee-do</i>
- scuttle!
- whoa!
mermaid off the port bow!
ariel, how you doin', kid?
- whoa, what a swim.
- scuttle, look what we found.
yeah, we were in this sunken
ship, and it was really creepy--
human stuff, huh?
hey, let me see.
oh! oh!
look at this.
wow. this is special.
this is very, very unusual.
- what? what is it?
- it's a dinglehopper.
humans use these little babies
to straighten their hair out.
see? just a little twirl here
and a yank there and viola--
ya got an aesthetically pleasing
configuration of hair...
that humans go nuts over.
a dinglehopper.
- what about that one?
- ah!
this i haven't seen in years.
this is wonderful.
a banded, bulbous...
- snarfblatt.
- oh!
now, the snarfblatt dates back
to prehistorical times...
when humans used to sit around
and stare at each other all day.
got very boring.
so, they invented this
snarfblatt to make fine music.
allow me.
music!
- it's stuck!
- oh, the concert!
- oh, my gosh! my father's gonna kill me!
- the concert was today?
- maybe you could make a little planter
out of it or something. - i'm sorry.
i've gotta go!
thank you, scuttle!
anytime, sweetie. anytime.
yes, hurry home,
princess.
we wouldn't want to miss
old daddy's celebration, now, would we?
ha! celebration, indeed.
oh, bah!
in my day, we had
fantastical feasts...
when i lived in the palace.
and, now, look at me.
wasted away to
practically nothing.
banished and exiled
and practically starving...
while he and his flimsy
fish folk celebrate.
well, i'll give 'em something
to celebrate soon enough.
flotsam! jetsam!
i want you to keep an extra close watch
on this pretty little daughter of his.
she may be the key
to triton's undoing.
i just don't know what we're going
to do with you, young lady.
daddy, i'm sorry.
i just forgot.
- as a result of your careless behavior--
- careless and reckless behavior--
the entire celebration
was, uh--
well, it was ruined! that's all!
completely destroyed!
this concert was to be the pinnacle
of my distinguished career.
now, thanks to you, i am
the laughing stock of the entire kingdom!
but it wasn't her fault--
uh, oh, first, uh, the shark chased us.
yeah, yeah. and we tried to--
but we couldn't, and he--
and-- and we--
whoa!
and then we were safe.
but then this seagull came, and it was,
"this is this, and that is that". and--
seagull?
what? oh.
you went up to the surface
again, didn't you? didn't you?
- nothing happened.
- oh, ariel, how many times must we go through this?
you could have been seen by one of those
barbarians, by-by one of those humans.
- daddy, they're not barbarians.
- they are dangerous.
do you think i want to see
my youngest daughter...
snared by some fish-eater's hook?
i'm 16 years old.
i'm not a child anymore.
don't you take that tone
of voice with me, young lady.
as long as you live under my ocean,
you'll obey my rules.
- but if you would just listen--
- not another word!
and i am never, never to hear
of you going to the surface again!
is that clear?
hmph! teenagers.
they think they know everything.
you give them an inch,
they swim all over you.
do you think
i was too hard on her?
definitely not.
why, if ariel was my daughter,
i'd show her who was boss.
none of this flitting to the
surface and other such nonsense.
no, sir. i'd keep her
under tight control.
- you're absolutely right, sebastian.
- of course.
- ariel needs constant supervision.
- constant.
someone to watch over her,
to keep her out of trouble.
- all the time.
- and you are just the crab to do it.
how do i get myself
into these situations?
i should be writing symphonies...
not tagging along after
some headstrong teenager.
hmm? what is that girl up to?
huh?
ariel, are you okay?
if only i could
make him understand.
i just don't see things
the way he does.
i don't see how a world that
makes such wonderful things...
could be bad.
<i>look at this stuff
isn't it neat?</i>
<i>wouldn't you think
my collection's complete?</i>
<i>wouldn't you think
i'm the giri</i>
<i>the girl who has
everything?</i>

sebastian!
ariel, what are you--
how could you-- what is all this?
it's, uh--
it's just my collection.
oh, i see.
your collection, hmm. if your
father knew about this place--
you're not gonna tell him,
are you?
oh, please, sebastian,
he would never understand.
ariel, you're under
a lot of pressure down here.
come with me.
i'll take you home...

we're bein' intrepidaceous.
we're out to discover!
i've never seen a human
this close before.
oh. he's very handsome, isn't he?
i don't know. he looks kind of
hairy and slobbery to me.
not that one.
the one playing the snarfblatt.
silence, silence.
it is now my honor and privilege...
to present our esteemed
prince eric...
with a very special,
very expensive...
very large birthday present.
ah, grimsby, ya old beanpole,
you shouldn't have.
i know.
happy birthday, eric.
uh, gee, grim-- ha'
it's, uh--
it's-it's really somethin'.
yes, i commissioned it myself.
of course, i had hoped
it would be a wedding present.

look, you're not still sore
because i didn't fall for...
the princess of glowehaven,
are you?
oh, my! oh, eric,
it isn't me alone.
the entire kingdom wants
to see you happily settled down...
with the right girl.
oh, she's out there somewhere.
i just--
i just haven't found her yet.
well, perhaps you haven't
been looking hard enough.
believe me, grim,
when i find her, i'll know.
without a doubt, it'll just--
bam-- hit me like lightning.
hurricane a-comin'!
stand fast!
secure the riggin'!
whoa! the wind's all ofa sudden
on the move here! yo!
ariel!
look out!
grim! ha-hang on!

it's hard to say.
oh, i-- i can't
make out a heartbeat.

he's breathing.
he's so beautiful.
<i>what would i give
to live where you are</i>
<i>what would i pay
to stay here beside you</i>
<i>what would i do to see you
smiling at me</i>
<i>where would we walk
where would we run</i>
<i>if we could stay all day
in the sun</i>
<i>just you and me
and i could be</i>
<i>part of your world</i>
eric? eric!
you really delight in
these sadistic strains...
on my blood pressure, don't you?
a-a girl... rescued me.
she-- she was singing.
she had the most
beautiful voice.
ah, eric, i think you've swallowed
a bit too much seawater.
off we go.
come on, max.
we just gonna forget
this whole thing ever happened.
the sea king will never know.
you won't tell him. i won't tell him.
i will stay in one piece.
<i>i don't know when
i don't know how</i>
<i>but i know something's
starting right now</i>
<i>watch and you'll see</i>
<i>someday i'll be</i>
<i>part of your</i>
<i>world</i>
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
i can't stand it. it's too easy.
the child is in love
with a human.
and not just any human.
a prince'
her daddy will love that.
king triton's headstrong,
lovesick girl...
would make a charming addition
to my little garden.
ariel, dear, time to come out.
you've been in there
all morning.
what is with her lately?
- oh. morning, daddy.
- well.
- oh, she's got it bad.
- what? what has she got?
isn't it obvious, daddy?
ariel's in love.
ariel? in love?
okay. so far, so good.
i don't think the king knows.
but it will not be easy keeping
something like this a secret for long.
he loves me.
mmm. he loves me not.
he loves me!
i knew it!
ariel, stop talking crazy!
i gotta see him again...
tonight.
- scuttle knows where he lives.
- ariel, please!
will you get your head out of the clouds
and back in the water where it belongs?
i'll swim up to his castle, then flounder
will splash around to get his attention.
- and then we'll go--
- down here is your home!
ariel, listen to me.

sebastian!
sebastian, i've been
looking all over for you.
- i've got an urgent message from the sea king.
- the sea king?
he wants to see you right away.
something about ariel.
- he knows.
- hey, let's see now.
oh, who could
the lucky merman be?
come in, sebastian.
i mustn't overreact.
i must remain calm.
yes?
- yes, your majesty?
- yes, sebastian.
i'm concerned about ariel.
have you noticed
she's been acting peculiar lately?
- oh! uh, peculiar?
- you know, mooning about.
daydreaming, singing to herself.
you haven't noticed, hmm?
oh, well, i--
- sebastian?
- hmm?
i know you've been keeping
something from me.
keeping something?
about ariel?
- ariel?
- in love, hmm?
i tried to stop her, sir!
she wouldn't listen!
i told her to stay away
from humans! they are bad!
- they are trouble!
- humans? what about humans?
humans?
who said anything about humans?
flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?
you'll see.
it's a surprise.
oh, flounder.
flounder, you're the best!
it looks just like him.
it even has his eyes.
why, eric, run away with you?
oh, this is all so-- so sudden.
daddy?
i consider myself
a reasonable merman.
i set certain rules, and i expect
those rules to be obeyed.
- but, dad, i--
- is it true you rescued a human from drowning?
- daddy, i had to--
- contact between the human world and the mer world is strictly forbidden.
ariel, you know that!
everyone knows that.
- he would have died.
- one less human to worry about.
- you don't even know him.
- know him?
i don't have to know him!
they're all the same.
spineless, savage, harpooning
fish-eaters incapable of any feeling--
daddy, i love him!
no!
have you lost
your senses completely?
- he's a human. you're a mermaid.
- i don't care.
so help me, ariel,
i am going to get through to you.
and if this is the
only way, so be it!
daddy! no!
no! please!
daddy, stop!
daddy, stop it!
daddy, no!
ariel, i--
just go away.
- poor child.
- poor, sweet child.
she has a very serious problem.
if only there were
something we could do.
but there is something.
who-- who are you?
don't be scared.
we represent someone
who can help you.
someone who can make
all your dreams come true.
just imagine--
you and your prince--
together forever.
- i don't understand.
- ursula has great powers.
the sea witch?
why, that's--
i couldn't possibly.
no! get out of here.
leave me alone!
suit yourself.
that was only a suggestion.
- wait.
- yes?
- poor ariel.
- i didn't mean to tell.
it was an accident.
ariel?
where are you going?
ariel, what are you doing
here with this riffraff?
i'm going to see ursula.
ariel, no! no!
she's a demon. she's a monster.
why don't you go tell my father?
you're good at that.
but-- but, i--
come on!
this way.
come in.
come in, my child.
we mustn't lurk in doorways.
it's rude.
one might question
your upbringing.
now, then, you're here...
because you have a thing for this human,
this, uh, prince fellow.
not that i blame you.
he is quite a catch, isn't he?
well, angelfish...
the solution to
your problem is simple.
the only way to get what you want
is to become a human yourself.
can you do that?
my dear, sweet child.
that's what i do.
it's what i live for:
to help unfortunate merfolk
like yourself...
poor souls with
no one else to turn to.
<i>i admit that in the past
i've been a nasty</i>
<i>they weren't kidding when
they called me well, a witch</i>
<i>but you'll find that nowadays
i've mended all my ways</i>
<i>repented, seen the light
and made a switch</i>
<i>true? yes.</i>
<i>and i fortunately know
a little magic</i>
<i>it's a talent that
i aiways have possessed</i>
<i>and here lateiy, please don't laugh,
i use it on behalf</i>
<i>of the miserable
lonely and depressed</i>
pathetic.
<i>poor unfortunate souls</i>
<i>in pain, in need</i>
<i>this one longing to be thinner
that one wants to get the girl</i>
<i>and do i help them
yes, indeed</i>
<i>those poor, unfortunate souls
so sad, so true</i>
<i>they come flocking to my cauldron,
crying spells, ursula, please</i>
<i>and i help them
yes, i do</i>
<i>now it's happened
once or twice</i>
<i>someone couldn't
pay the price</i>
<i>and i'm afraid i had to
rake 'em across the coals</i>
<i>yes, i've had
the odd complaint</i>
<i>but on the whole
i've been a saint</i>
<i>to those poor
unfortunate souls</i>
now, here's the deal.
i will make you a potion that will
turn you into a human for three days.
got that? three days.
now, listen,
this is important.
before the sun sets
on the third day...
you've got to get dear old princie
to fall in love with you.
that is,
he's got to kiss you.
not just any kiss--
the kiss of true love.
if he does kiss you before
the sun sets on the third day...
you'll remain human
permanently.
but if he doesn't,
you'll turn back into a mermaid...
and... you belong to me!
no, ariel!
have we got a deal?
if i become human, i'll never be
with my father or sisters again.
that's right.
but you'll have your man.
life's full of
tough choices, isn't it?
oh! and there is
one more thing.
we haven't discussed
the subject of payment.
you can't get something
for nothing, you know.
- but i don't have any--
- i'm not asking much.
just a token really, a trifle.
you'll never even miss it.
what i want from you
is your voice.
- my voice?
- you've got it, sweetcakes.
no more talking, singing.
zip!
but without my voice,
how can i--
you'll have your looks,
your pretty face.
and don't underestimate the importance
of body language! ha!
<i>the men up there
don't like a lot of blabber</i>
<i>they think a girl
who gossips is a bore</i>
<i>yes, on land it's much preferred
for ladies not to say a word</i>
<i>and, after all, dear what is idle prattle for
come on, then!</i>
<i>they're not all that
impressed with conversation</i>
<i>true gentlemen avoid it
when they can</i>
<i>but they dote and swoon and fawn
on a lady who's with drawn</i>
<i>it's she who holds her tongue
who gets her man</i>
<i>come on, you poor
unfortunate soul</i>
<i>go ahead
make your choice</i>
<i>i'm a very busy woman
and i haven't got all day</i>
<i>it won't cost much
just your voice</i>
<i>ya poor, unfortunate soul</i>
<i>it's sad, but true</i>
<i>if you want to cross a bridge
my sweet, you've got to pay the toll</i>
<i>take a gulp and take a breath
and go ahead and sign the scroll</i>
<i>flotsam, jetsam
now i've got her, boys</i>
<i>the boss is on a roll</i>
<i>this poor, unfortunate</i>
<i>soul</i>
<i>beluga, sevruga</i>
<i>come winds of the caspian sea</i>
<i>larynxis, glossitis
et maxlaryngitis</i>
<i>la voce to me</i>
now, sing!
keep singing!
that voice.
i can't get it out of my head.
i've looked everywhere, max.
where could she be?
well, look at what
the catfish dragged in.
look at ya. look at ya.
there's somethin' different.
don't tell me.
i got it.
it's your hairdo, right?
you've been usin'
the dinglehopper, right?
no? no, huh?
well, let me see.
new seashells?
no new seashells. i gotta admit
i can't put my foot on it right now.
- but if i just stand here long enough--
- she's got legs, you idiot!
she traded her voice to the sea witch
and got legs. geez, man!
i knew that.
ariel's been
turned into a human.
she's gotta make the prince fall
in love with her, and he's gotta k--
- he's gotta kiss her.
- and she's only got three days!
just look at her!
on legs! on human legs!
my nerves are shot!
this is a catastrophe!
what would her father say? i'll
tell you what her father'd say.
he'd say he's gonna kill himself
a crab! that's what her father'd say!
i'm gonna march meself
straight home right now...
and tell him just like i
should have done the minute--
and don't you shake
your head at me, young lady.
maybe there's still time.
if we could get that witch...
to give you back your voice...
you could go home with all
the normal fish and just be--
just be--
just be miserable
for the rest of your life.
all right, all right.
i'll try to help ya
find that prince.
boy, what a soft shell
i'm turning out to be.
now, ariel, i'm tellin' ya.
if you wanna be a human...
the first thing ya gotta do is
dress like one. now, let me see.
max? what?
huh? what?
max!
ya look great, kid.
ya look sensational.
max!
max!
quiet, max.
what's gotten
into you, fella? oh.
oh, i see.
are you okay, miss?
i'm sorry if this
knuckle head scared you.
he's harmless really, uh--
you seem very familiar to me.
have we met?
we have met. i knew it. you're the one,
the one i've been looking for.
what's your name?
w-what's wrong?
what is it?
you can't speak? oh!
oh, then you couldn't be
who i thought.
w-what is it?
y-you're hurt?
no, no. you need help?
whoa, whoa, careful!
careful, easy.
gee, you must have really
been through something.
don't worry. don't worry.
i'll help you.
come on. come on.
you'll be okay.
washed up from a shipwreck.
oh, the poor thing.
we'll have you feeling better
in no time.
i'll just-- i'll just
get this washed for you.
well, you must have at least
heard about this girl.
- no!
- gertrude says--
when has gertrude ever
gotten anything right?
- i mean, really.
- madam, please--
this girl shows up in rags and doesn't
speak. not my idea of a princess.
if eric's looking for a girl,
i know a couple of...
highly available ones right here.
oh, eric, be reasonable.
nice young ladies just don't
swim around rescuing people...
in the middle of the ocean, and then
flitter off into oblivion like some--
i'm tellin' ya, grim.
she was real.
i'm gonna find that girl,
and i'm gonna marry her.
come on, honey.
don't be shy.
oh, eric,
isn't she a vision?
uh, you look wonderful.
come, come, come.
you must be famished.
let me help you, my dear.
there-- oh, there we go. eh,
that's better. now, quite comfy, hmm?
ha, ha. good.
it's, uh--
it's, uh, not often that we have
such a lovely dinner guest, eh, eric?
uh, do you like it?
it-it is rather a fine one.
- oh, my.
- s-sorry, grim.
why, eric, that's the first time
i've seen you smile in weeks.
ah, very amusing.
carlotta, my dear,
what's for dinner?
oh, you're gonna love it! chef's been
fixing his speciality: stuffed crab.
<i>maurice chevalier</i>
<i>how i love les poissons</i>
<i>love to chop
and to serve little fish</i>
<i>first i cut off their heads
then i pull out their bones</i>
<i>with the cleaver
i hack them in two</i>
<i>i pull out what's inside
and i serve it up fried</i>
<i>god, i love little fishes
don't you?</i>
<i>here's something for
tempting the palate</i>
<i>prepared in
the classic technique</i>
<i>first you pound the fish
flat with the mallet</i>
<i>then you slash through the skin
give the belly a slice</i>
<i>then you rub some salt in
'cause that makes it taste nice</i>
- oh.
- zut alors! i have missed one.
<i>sacre bleu
what is this?</i>
<i>how on earth could i miss such
a sweet little succulent crab</i>
<i>quelle dommage, what a loss
here we go in the sauce</i>
<i>now some flour
i think just a dab</i>
<i>now i'll stuff you with bread
it don't hurt 'cause you're dead</i>
<i>and you're certainiy
lucky you are</i>
<i>'cause it's gonna be hot
in my big silver pot</i>
eh?
what is this? ow!
yeow!
oh, ow, ow, oh!
i think i'd better go see
what louie is up to.
come out, you little pipsqueak,
and fight like a man!
- louie!
- ow.
- what are you doing?
- well, i-i-i was just, uh, uh, uh--
i'm sorry, madame.
you know, eric, perhaps
our young guest might enjoy...
seeing some of the sights
of the kingdom.
something in the way
of a tour.
i'm sorry, grim.
what was that?
you can't spend all your time
moping about. you need to get out.
do something. have a life.
get your mind off--
easy, grim, easy. it's not
a bad idea, if she's interested.
well, what do ya say?
would you like to join me...
on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?
wonderful! now, let's eat before
this crab wanders off my plate.
come here, boy.
this has got to be,
without a doubt...
the single most
humiliating day of my life.
i hope that you appreciate what
i go through for you, young lady.
now, we got to make a plan
to get that boy to kiss you.
tomorrow, when he takes you
for that ride, you gotta look your best.
you gotta bat your eyes,
like this.
you gotta pucker up
your lips, like this.
you are hopeless, child.
you know that?
completely hopeless.
- any sign of them?
- no, your majesty.
we've searched everywhere.
we've found no trace of
your daughter or sebastian.
well, keep looking. leave no shell
unturned, no coral unexplored.
let no one in this kingdom sleep
until she's safe at home.
yes, sire.
oh, what have i done?
what have i done?
- has he kissed her yet?
- not yet.
oh!
oh, judy!
yo! flounder!
any kissing?
no, not yet.
hmm. well, they'd--
they'd better get crackin'!
move over.
move your big feathers.
- i can't see a thing.
- nothing is happening.
only one day left, and that boy
ain't puckered up once.
okay, all right,
this calls for...
a little vocal
romantic stimulation.
stand back!
wow. somebody should find that poor
animal and put it out of its misery.
oh! geez, man.
i'm surrounded by amateurs.
you want something done,
you've got to do it yourself.
first we got to
create the mood.
percussion.
strings. winds.
words.
<i>there you see her</i>
<i>sitting there across the way</i>
<i>she don't got a lot to say
but there's something about her</i>
<i>and you don't know why
but you're dyin' to try</i>
<i>you wanna kiss the girl</i>
d-did you hear something?
<i>- yes
- you want her</i>
<i>look at her
you know you do</i>
<i>possible
she wants you too</i>
<i>there is one way
to ask her</i>
<i>it don't take a word</i>
<i>not a single word
go on and kiss the girl</i>
sing with me now.
<i>sha-la-la-la-la-la
my, oh, my</i>
<i>look like the boy too shy
he ain't gonna kiss the girl</i>
<i>sha-la-la-la-la-la
ain't that sad, ain't it a shame</i>
<i>too bad
he gonna miss the girl</i>
you know, i feel really bad
not knowing your name.
maybe i can guess.
is it, uh, mildred?
okay, no.
how about diana?
rachel?
- ariel. her name is ariel.
- ariel?
ariel? oh.
that's kind of pretty.
okay. ariel.
<i>now's your moment</i>
<i>floating in a blue lagoon</i>
<i>boy, you better do it soon</i>
<i>- no time will be better
- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>
<i>she don't say a word
and she won't say a word</i>
<i>until ya kiss the girl</i>
<i>sha-la-la-la-la-la
don't be scared</i>
<i>you got the mood prepared
go on and kiss the girl</i>
<i>sha-la-la-la-la-la
don't stop now</i>
<i>don't try to hide it how
you wanna kiss the girl</i>
<i>whoa, whoa</i>
<i>sha-la-la-la-la-la

<i>and listen to the song</i>
<i>the song say kiss the girl</i>
<i>sha-la-la-la-la-la

whoa!

nice work, boys.
that was a close one.
too close.
the little tramp!
ah, she's better
than i thought.
well, at this rate, he'll be
kissing her by sunset for sure.
well, it's time ursula took
matters into her own tentacles.
triton's daughter will be mine!
and then i'll make him writhe.
i'll see him wriggle
like a worm on a hook!
eric?
if i may say...
far better than any dream girl
is one of flesh and blood...
one warm and caring
and right before your eyes.
ariel!
ariel, wake up! wake up!
i just heard the news!
congratulations, kiddo,
we did it!
ooh. what is this idiot
babbling about?
right, as if you two
didn't know, huh?
the whole town's buzzin'
about the prince...
gettin' himself hitched
this afternoon!
you know,
he's getting married.
you silly side-walker.
i just wanted to wish ya luck.
i'll catch ya later.
i wouldn't miss it!
well, now, eric.
it appears that
i was mistaken.
this mystery maiden of yours
does, in fact, exist.
a-and she is lovely.
congratulations, my dear.
we wish to be married
as soon as possible.
oh, yes, of course, eric, but,
these things do take time, you know.
this afternoon, grimsby.
the wedding ship departs at sunset.
oh. oh. very well, eric,
uh, as you wish.
<i>what a lovely little
bride i'll make</i>
<i>my dear
i'll look divine</i>
<i>things are working out
according to my ultimate design</i>
<i>soon i'll have that little mermaid
and the ocean will be mine</i>
the sea witch! oh, no!
she's gonna-- i gotta--
ariel!
ariel!
ariel, i was flying--
i was--
of course i was flying,
and i-i saw the-- the watch--
the witch was watchin'
the mirror...
and she was singing
with a stolen set of pipes.
do you hear what
i'm tellin' you?
the prince is marrying
the sea witch in disguise!
- are you sure about this?
- have i ever been wrong?
i mean,
when it's important?
what are we gonna do?
before the sun sets
on the third day.
ariel, grab onto that.
flounder, get her to that boat
as fast as your fins can carry you.
i'll try!
i gotta get to the sea king.
he must know about this.
- wh-what about me? what about me?
- you!
find a way to
stall that wedding!
stall the wedding.
w-what am i...?
what...? that's it!
move it! let's go!
we got an emergency here.
dearly beloved--
don't worry, ariel.
we-we're gonna make it.
we're--
we're almost there.
yes, um, do you, eric,
take vanessa...
to be your lawfully
wedded wife...
for as long as
you both shall live?
i do.
it being--
and do you--
oh!
then by the power--
get away from me,
you slimy little--
oh, why, you little--
huh? ahh. huh?
- ariel?
- eric!
you-- you can talk?
- you're the one.
- eric, get away from her.
- it-it was you all the time.
- oh, eric, i-i wanted to tell you.
eric, no!
you're too late!
you're too late!
- so long, lover boy.
- ariel!
poor little princess.
it's not you i'm after.
i've a much bigger fish to--
- ursula, stop!
- hmph!
why, king triton!
how are you?
- let her go!
- not a chance, triton! she's mine now!
- we made a deal.
- daddy, i'm sorry! i-i--
i didn't mean to!
i didn't know!
you see? the contract's legal,
binding and completely unbreakable...
even for you.
of course, i always was a girl
with an eye for a bargain.
the daughter of the great sea king
is a very precious commodity.
but i might be willing
to make an exchange...
for someone even better.
- eric, what are you doing?
- grim, i lost her once.
i'm not gonna lose her again!
now, do we have a deal?
ha! it's done then!
no! oh, no!
your majesty.
daddy.
- at last... it's mine.
- no.
you!
- you monster!
- don't fool with me, ya little brat!
contract or no,
i'll blast-- ow!
- why, you little fool.
- eric! eric, look out!
after him!
come on!
ow!
say good-bye
to your sweetheart.
aah!
babies! my poor
little poopsies.
eric, you've gotta
get away from here.
no, i won't leave you.
you pitiful,
insignificant fools!
look out!
now i am the ruler
of all the ocean!
the waves obey
my every whim!
eric!
the sea and all its spoils
bow to my power!
eric!
so much for true love!
she really does love him,
doesn't she, sebastian?
well, it's like
i always say, your majesty.
children got to be free
to lead their own lives.
you always say that?
then i guess there's
just one problem left.
and what's that,
your majesty?
how much i'm going
to miss her.
aha!
yes! thank you. thank you.
i love you, daddy.
