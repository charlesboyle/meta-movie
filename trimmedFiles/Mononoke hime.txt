<i>[man narrating]</i>
<i>in ancient times, the land</i>
<i>lay covered in forests,</i>
<i>where, from ages long past,</i>
<i>dwelt the spirits of the gods.</i>
<i>back then, man and beast</i>
<i>lived in harmony,</i>
<i>but as time went by, most</i>
<i>of the great forests were destroyed.</i>
<i>those that remained were guarded</i>
<i>by gigantic beasts...</i>
<i>who owed their allegiance</i>
<i>to the great forest spirit,</i>
<i>for those were the days</i>
<i>of gods and demons.</i>
<i>[rustling, growling]</i>
<b><u><i>princess mononoke</i></u></b>
yakul! come on, boy.
[grunts]
- girls!
- ashitaka!
there's something strange going on.
you have to hurry.
the wise woman wants everybody back
to the village at once.
- we just came from ji-san.
- did he see something?
yes, in the forest.
something's wrong.
- the birds have gone.
- the animals too.
i'll go to the watchtower
and check with ji-san.
you three hurry back home
and be quick about it.
all right.
be careful!
huh?
<i>[rumbling]</i>
something's there.
-ji-san, did you see it too?
- i did. it isn't human.
the wise woman's calling everybody
back to the village.
there. look.
- it's some kind of demon!
- a demon?
[roaring]
run, yakul! run!
[screaming]
it's headed for the village.
i've got to stop it.
<i>prince ashitaka, wait!</i>
<i>be careful!</i>
that thing is cursed!
don't let it touch you!
here, yakul!
[whistles]
calm your fury, o mighty lord!
whatever you may be, god or demon,
please leave us in peace!
[shouting]
- the monster!
- come on!
go back! please!
leave our village alone!
stop! please! stop!
[panting]
- [groaning]
- get up!
- run!
- come on! hurry!
[grunting]
[shrieking]
[groaning]
- he killed it!
- ashitaka!
- fetch the wise woman!
- don't put the fire out yet.
- [groaning]
- ashitaka!
are you all right?
- kaya, don't touch it.
this wound is evil.
- the prince has been hurt.
- where is the wise woman?
-<i>[man] here she comes!</i>
you must keep away from him, all of you.
everyone, stay back.
- what shall we do?
- take this and pour it
over his wound, child, slowly.
- all right.
- [groans]
[labored breathing]
o nameless god
of rage and hate,
i bow before you.
a mound will be raised and
funeral rites performed on this
ground where you have fallen.
pass on in peace
and bear us no hatred.
disgusting little creatures,
soon all of you
will feel my hate...
and suffer
as i have suffered.
[gasps]
<i>[wind howling]</i>
[rattling]
<i>[rattling continues]</i>
i'm afraid this is very bad.
the stones tell me the boar god
came from far to the west.
he had some kind of poison inside him,
driving him mad,
a poisonous hatred that consumed
his heart and flesh...
and turned him
into a demon monster.
- prince ashitaka?
- yes?
- prince ashitaka?
- yes?
<i>show everyone</i>
<i>your right arm.</i>
- [gasping]
- what's it mean?
my prince, are you
prepared to learn...
what fate the stones
have foretold you?
yes, i was prepared
the very moment that
i let my arrow fly.
mmm.
the infection will spread
throughout your whole body,
bone and flesh alike.
<i>it will cause you great pain</i>
<i>and then kill you.</i>
is there no way
we can stop it?
the prince got that wound
by defending our village
and saving our lives!
do we just sit here
and watch him die?
you cannot alter
your fate, my prince.
however, you can rise
to meet it, if you choose.
look at this.
this iron ball was found
in the boar's body.
<i>this is what hurt him so.</i>
<i>it shattered his bones and</i>
<i>burned its way deep inside him.</i>
<i>this is what turned him</i>
<i>into a demon.</i>
there is evil at work in the land
to the west, prince ashitaka.
it's your fate to go there
and see what you can see
with eyes unclouded by hate.
<i>you may fjnd a way</i>
<i>to lift the curse.</i>
- <i>you understand?</i>
- yes.
we are the last
of the emishi.
it's 500 years since the emperor
destroyed our tribe...
and drove the remnants
of our people to the east.
some managed to survive here
for all these years,
but the blood of our tribe
has grown thinner and weaker
with each generation.
now our last prince must
cut his hair and leave us,
never to return?
<i>sometimes i think the gods</i>
<i>are laughing at us.</i>
our laws forbid us from watching you go,
ashitaka.
whatever comes to pass now,
you are dead to us forever.
farewell.
- ashitaka!
- kaya, what are you doing here?
you know it's forbidden.
do you think
i care about that?
i came to give you this so you won't
forget your little sister.
your crystal dagger.
kaya, i can't take this.
please, keep it with you,
brother, to protect you.
you must take it with you.
please, i want you to have it,
so you won't... forget.
kaya, you know i could
never forget you.
[twitters]
<i>[chirping]</i>
<i>[hoofbeats galloping]</i>
a battle?
<i>no. a massacre.</i>
where are you going?
come back here, you coward!
- [laughs]
- they're unarmed! move in!
<i>[man]</i>
<i>look! up there, on the hill!</i>
- it's a warrior!
- good! his head is mine!
- [shouting]
- [screams]
you! stop!
[groans]
- my arm! what's happening to me?
-<i>stop him!</i>
hurry! stop him
before he gets away!
let me pass!
i'm warning you!
a demon.
<i>[water running]</i>
the mark is
getting bigger.
- [chattering]
- [horse whinnying]
-<i>[man] who's that?</i>
-<i>[man #2] i've never seen him.</i>
are you selling soup
or donkey piss?
<i>[child]</i>
<i>mommy! look!</i>
there he is now.
<i>[man]</i>
<i>i wouldn't get too close to him.</i>
- will this be enough?
- hey! what are you trying to pull?
this isn't money.
give me back my rice, you little thief.
- excuse me, but might i inspect that?
- go ahead.
mmm? my god!
but this is a lump of pure gold,
you silly woman!
however, if it's money you want,
i'll pay for the rice and take
this nugget off your hands.
what do ya say?
my good people, is there
a money changer who could
tell us how much this is worth?
no? all right.
now, i'm just a monk,
but i'd say three bags
of rice at least.
that's right, maybe even more.
hey, wait a minute.
where are you going?
where are you going?
give me my gold!
hey! you can't
just rush off now.
we've only just met.
we have got your rice,
and everything's fine.
you're a man of few words.
i understand.
don't you even think of thanking me.
it was my pleasure.
in fact, i should be
thanking you, really.
<i>you see, i was caught in that battle.</i>
<i>i saw what you did to those samurai.</i>
<i>you fjght like a demon.</i>
<i>where'd you learn to fjght like that?</i>
i see you noticed
we're being followed.
that's what we get for waving that
gold nugget around.
<i>they'll wait till we're asleep,</i>
<i>then slit our throats.</i>
what to you say we give 'em
a little demonstration
of how fast we can run, huh?
so the demon monster turned out to be
a giant boar.
i followed its trail westward through
the mountains...
to where the samurai were attacking
those villagers.
- but then--
- you lost it. that's life.
see this place here?
when i came here last, a few years back,
this was a lovely little village.
<i>but then there must have been</i>
<i>a flood or a landslide or a fjre.</i>
<i>the only sure thing</i>
<i>is that everybody's dead.</i>
these days, there are
angry ghosts all around us,
dead from wars,
sickness, starvation.
and nobody cares.
so you say you're under a curse?
so what? so's the whole damn world.
[blows] mmm! ahh!
i was wrong to fight in that village.
two men are dead because of me.
<i>samurai thugs.</i>
<i>you win some,you lose some.</i>
hand me your bowl.
my point is, everybody dies.
some now, some later.
from brothel girl
to emperor.
i've heard them say that the emperor
has promised...
an entire hill of gold to anyone
who can help him live forever.
beautiful bowl.
i've seen one other like it.
have you ever heard
of the emishi people?
they're said to ride red elks.
<i>they also use stone arrowheads</i>
<i>just like you.</i>
of course, they were all
wiped out 500 years ago.
don't worry.
i won't tell anyone where you're from.
anyway, i've got
much bigger fish to fry.
have you ever come across
anything like this before?
never have.
it came from the giant boar.
it was inside him.
i'm sure it was that little ball of iron
that killed him.
[grunts]
there's a place high in the mountains
far to the west of here.
it's where the spirit of the
forest dwells, and it's a very
dangerous place for humans.
- to enter there is certain death.
- the spirit of the forest?
i've been told the beasts there
are all giants,
just as they were in the dawn of time.
see ya there, my friend. mmm.
[oxen mooing]
hyah! move! hyah!
hyah! come on!
watch the load!
push him!
hyah! ha!
the sooner we get this rice
home, the sooner we eat.
let's move!
coming this way! wolves!
<i>[thunder rumbling]</i>
don't let the oxen panic! stay calm!
take up your positions!
keep your powder dry.
<i>[man]</i>
<i>make sure you wait for them</i>
<i>to come within range!</i>
- ready! and fire!
- fire!
- they're getting away!
- fire!
<i>[gunfjre]</i>
-<i>[woman] second round! fire!</i>
- fire!
that was it?
they weren't so big.
they're just pups.
wait till you see their mother.
[mooing]
where are they?
it's moro!
[screaming]
come on.
[screaming]
<i>ha, ha!</i>
<i>we killed her!</i>
you forget she is a god.
it will take more than that.
[groaning]
- she certainly did some damage.
- we move out now.
what about the men
she pushed over the cliff?
<i>they're dead.</i>
<i>let's get the living home.</i>
<i>[water running,</i>
<i>birds twittering]</i>
[gasps]
he's still breathing.
hang on.
huh?
[gasps]
[growling]
[ringing]
my name is ashitaka!
i have traveled far
from lands to the east.
are you ancient gods,
and have i come at last to the realm
of the spirit of the forest?
go away.
[gasps]
<i>[man screams]</i>
[grunting]
[whimpering]
<i>[man whimpering]</i>
a kodama! i never thought
i'd see one of them here.
<i>[whimpering]</i>
<i>oh, no, no, no, no!</i>
easy there. you don't want
to make your injuries worse, do you?
-<i>[man grunts] oh, no!</i>
- [clicking]
he's a tree spirit.
he brings good luck.
it's a sign
this forest is healthy.
but they'll lead their lord
and master right to us.
who do you mean?
you mean those wolves i just saw?
- <i>no, i mean a real monster,</i>
<i>like a huge enormous deer,</i>
- [clicking]
<i>except they say it's got</i>
<i>a human face sometimes,</i>
<i>and then at night they say it</i>--
[screams]
where'd it go?
- <i>look! reinforcements! we're doomed!</i>
- [clicking]
oh, no!
if yakul's not afraid, then we have
nothing to worry about here.
would you be kind enough
to grant us passage through
your forest, little one?
[clicking]
sir, i really think
we should turn around now.
i wonder, did i mention
that no humans have ever made it
through these woods alive?
there's a lovely trail
back across the river.
the current's too swift
for us to get across,
and your friend's injuries
are very bad.
if we don't get him back soon,
he doesn't have a chance.
hey, little fellow,
are you showing us the way
or just getting us more lost?
[panting]
please, sir, i'm really
pretty sure they're not
trying to help us get home.
oh, my god!
there's thousands of them.
[grunts]
look at that.
that must be their mother,
a fine old tree.
[whimpers]
[clicking]
oh. this place is magical.
the tracks of those wolves
and the girl with them.
this place must be where
the four of them live.
sir, i think maybe we took
a wrong turn somewhere.
this is a place
for gods and demons.
i think we're safe.
we'll rest a bit.
more tracks?
whatever made these
made them recently.
[gasps]
<i>[squishing sound]</i>
[grunting]
sir! what's going on?
are you all right?
[grunting]
<i>[heart beating]</i>
<i>[beating continues]</i>
<i>[beating fades]</i>
[grunts, pants]
uh, sir, what
just happened there?
you went white as a sheet
all of a sudden.
- <i>i warned you about this place.</i>
- here.
- did you see anything just then?
- <i>like what?</i>
forget it.
hang on just a little longer.
you're almost home.
i failed her.
<i>it's gone,</i>
whatever it was.
<i>[birds twittering]</i>
that's strange.
suddenly he doesn't feel heavy at all.
my arm!
it doesn't hurt!
it's healed!
[groans] no, it's still broken.
<i>[birds twittering]</i>
[laughing]
sir, you were right. we made it
back home just like you said!
<i>[metal clanging]</i>
[mooing]
it's a fortress.
<i>it's lady eboshi's irontown. we make</i>
<i>iron here from the ore in the sand.</i>
<i>hey, there!</i>
<i>hello, it's me!</i>
- look there!
- hello!
- someone's come out of the woods.
- is it the wolf girl?
look! it's me!
kohroku, the ox driver!
- it's kohroku! he's alive!
- kohroku's alive!
- it's true! kohroku's still alive!
- let's go see!
quiet! stop that noise!
i'm trying to tally these accounts here,
so shut up!
- haven't you heard? kohroku's
come back from the dead!
- what?
[chattering]
- there they are!
- there he is!
- that's it.
- [nickers]
- this is unbelievable.
- where are the others, kohroku?
- yes, is my son with you?
- i'm afraid we're the only ones
who made it.
[groans]
<i>it's never the guards that die.</i>
stand aside.
that man in the weird costume, sir?
who do you think it could be?
he's obviously an outsider.
- be careful.
- listen to me, everyone!
this stranger saved our lives.
he carried the rifleman
all the way back here.
you should be grateful to him.
ow! hey, watch the arm.
- [whimpering]
- sir.
[grunts]
hold it right there.
i'm very grateful for you bringing
these men back to us, stranger,
but something
doesn't smell right.
you got back almost as fast as we did
and through the forbidden forest.
on top of that, you did it
with two badly injured men,
- and you want me
to believe that you--
- kohroku! kohroku!
- you're alive!
- <i>toki, my love!</i>
- [gasps]
- huh?
that's just great!
how are you gonna drive the ox
now all banged up and mangled?
- <i>but, my little flower</i>--
- you scared me half to death.
don't you "little flower" me.
i wish the wolves <i>had</i> eaten you.
<i>then maybe i could have</i>
<i>found a real husband!</i>
sweetness, can we
discuss this later?
toki, save your sweet nothings
for some other time.
and as for you, gonza, a fine
captain of the guard you are,
and as for you, gonza, a fine
captain of the guard you are,
always strutting and
throwing your weight around
once the danger's over.
you never do a lick
of work around here.
that's unfair and untrue.
thanks, stranger.
my husband's an idiot,
but i'm glad he's safe and sound.
that's a relief. i was starting
to think i'd done something
wrong by bringing him back home.
[laughing]
say, why don't you take the mask off?
i bet you're really handsome.
<i>[woman] gonza?</i>
bring the stranger
to me later.
i would like
to thank him personally.
- kohroku.
- uh, yes?
-<i>i'm happy you're back, and i apologize.</i>
-uh, okay.
uh-oh, milady, you really shouldn't
tell him things like that.
if you're too nice to him,
he'll walk all over you.
i hope you'll forgive me, too, toki.
i was responsible.
i should never have let it happen.
oh, that's all right. milady,
if you hadn't been there,
the wolves would have eaten
everyone, and then we'd all have
to find ourselves new husbands.
get some rest, traveler.
i will see you this evening.
oh, hey! you're not handsome,
you're gorgeous!
[pounding]
<i>[pounding continues]</i>
- pull!
- [grunting]
[chattering]
here! you know, they had to fight off
wolves to get this rice through.
just dish it out!
- [chattering]
- there he is!
- where is he?
- over there in the back.
toki was right.
he is handsome.
- yeah, not bad.
- but he's so young!
- <i>that never stopped you before.</i>
-<i>[women laughing]</i>
quiet out there!
we lost some good men today.
yeah, there's lots of
gorgeous men in here, honey!
i've seen cattle
that looked better.
listen, stranger.
why don't you come over to our place?
you don't want to stay
in this stinking old barn.
look, woman! we risked our lives
to bring you the rice...
you're all eating tonight,
so watch your mouth.
and who made the iron that paid
for that rice, huh? tell me that.
yeah, we're pumping those bellows
while you pigs are in bed.
actually, if it's not too much
trouble, ladies, i would like
to see where you work.
- you would?
- we'll have to work in makeup tonight.
lend me your lipstick.
- don't be a stranger.
- don't forget now.
we'll be waiting for you.
it's best not to pay them
any mind, you know.
lady eboshi spoils them rotten.
that's why they're like that.
they say that happy women
make a happy village.
happy? ha!
those kind of women workin' here?
women like that-- it's a disgrace.
they defile the iron.
lady eboshi goes around
buying the contract of
every brothel girl she can find.
milady has a kind heart,
that's all.
you got rice
on your chin, old man.
it's true. everything here has turned
upside-down since she showed up.
that's right. she's not even afraid
of the gods, that woman.
you should have seen the way she dealt
with nago. am i right?
- who's nago?
- "who's nago?" the gigantic boar god.
he used to rule
this whole forest.
we couldn't even get near the mountains
with him around.
nothing to do but sit around
on our backsides for months,
starin' at a bunch
of angry boars.
mm-hmm. see, the iron in the sand
under this town had all been dug out.
then we tried to get at the iron
under the mountain, but nago
wasn't gonna stand for that.
the problem was, before
we could dig for the iron,
we had to clear away the forest,
and that's what
made the boar angry.
[screaming]
[screaming]
[laughing]
he's feeling no pain.
then one day lady eboshi came along
with her warriors and her rifles.
[shrieking]
young man, what's wrong?
is something
hurting your arm?
no, i was just thinking
about the boar god.
i was thinking how he must
have died filled with hate.
<i>[hammering continues]</i>
forgive me for keeping you
waiting, stranger.
that's good iron.
we were running behind
with tomorrow's shipment.
let's have a rest.
- you may tell the others.
- yes, ma'am.
some think you're either a spy
for the wolf girl or for lord asano
and his samurai.
there are a lot of people out there
with their eyes on this iron.
why are you here,
if you don't mind my asking?
i believe
you'll recognize this.
it shattered the bones
of a giant boar,
rotted his flesh and
turned him into a monster.
i fought with him,
and for that i was cursed
with this mark on my arm,
and soon it will kill me.
where is it you come from?
i've never seen a red elk
like that before.
i have come a very long way.
i can't tell you more than that.
[growls] answer milady's question
or i'll cut you in half!.
what do you plan to do?
what exactly are you here for?
to see with eyes
unclouded by hate.
"eyes unclouded?"
[laughing]
that explains it.
come. i'll show you all my secrets.
- is that wise, milady?
- gonza, take over for me.
oh. [grunts]
[chattering]
[grunting]
this is my garden. none
of the townspeople dare to come here.
<i>follow me if you wish</i>
<i>to learn my secret.</i>
- [clucking]
- good evening.
<i>[chattering, laughing]</i>
<i>[woman] we've only just</i>
<i>fjnished it, milady.</i>
it's still too heavy.
perhaps if you didn't
hold it so delicately?
milady, if we make them
any lighter, they'll fall apart.
i trust you to figure it out.
they're not for me.
they're for the other women here.
<i>[woman]</i>
<i>that'll be something to see.</i>
this is the latest rifle
that i've asked these people to design.
the ones we brought here
have turned out to be too heavy.
<i>these will kill</i>
<i>forest monsters and pierce</i>
<i>the thickest samurai armor.</i>
you better watch out there, young man.
lady eboshi wants to rule the world.
i'm sorry to have
to push you all so hard.
- i'll have wine sent down later.
- oh, that'll be nice.
first you steal
the boar's forest from him and
then transform him into a demon.
now you're making
even deadlier weapons!
how much more hatred and pain
do you think we need?
yes, i'm the one who shot the boar,
and i'm sorry that you suffer.
i truly am.
that brainless pig.
i'm the one he should have
put a curse on, not you.
[grunting]
- no!
- [gasping]
does that right hand of yours
wish to kill me now, ashitaka?
if it would lift the curse,
i'd let it tear you apart,
but even that wouldn't end
the killing now, would it?
no, it wouldn't. it would have to kill
all of us to be at peace.
milady, osa has
something to say.
forgive me, milady.
you must not make light
of the boy's strength.
young man, like you,
i know what rage feels like...
and grief and helplessness.
but you must not take
your revenge on lady eboshi.
she is the only one
who saw us as human beings.
we are lepers.
the world hates and fears us,
but she took us in and washed
our rotting flesh and bandaged us.
- [coughing]
- osa?
life is suffering.
it is hard.
the world is cursed,
but still, you find reasons
to keep living.
i'm sorry.
i'm making no sense.
<i>[wolf howling]</i>
oh, they just keep coming back.
every night they're
out there planting trees,
trying to turn the mountain
into a forest again.
stay here. help me kill
the forest spirit, ashitaka.
you would do that?
kill the very heart of the forest?
without that ancient god the
animals here would be nothing
but dumb beasts once more.
when the forest has been cleared
and the wolves wiped out,
this desolate place will be
the richest land in the world,
and princess mononoke
will become human.
princess mononoke?
princess of the spirits of ghouls,
beasts and ancient gods.
the wolf stole her soul,
and now she lives to kill me.
[ringing]
the legends say the blood
of the great forest's spirit
can heal anything.
perhaps it could cure
my poor lepers.
might even be able to lift
your curse, ashitaka.
<i>milady! how does the action feel to you?</i>
<i>better?</i>
smooth as silk, the perfect
thing for ruling the world.
-<i>ah!</i>
- it's still too heavy for the girls.
<i>all right.</i>
-<i>[metal clanging]</i>
-<i>♪♪ [women singing]</i>
<i>♫ [singing continues]</i>
♪♪ [singing continues]
- [gasping]
- well, look who's here.
evening. all right if i work
the bellows for a while?
- well, i guess so.
- [grunts]
- excuse me. may i try it?
- huh?
it's okay.
might as well let him try.
[stammering, laughs]
[laughing]
when you get tired,
i'll take over for you.
well, that won't be long.
oops! better keep
that kimono shut tight, girl.
i'm impressed, but you'll
never keep that pace up.
- it's hard work, isn't it?
- mm-hmm.
you bet, and our shifts
are four days long.
you must lead hard lives here.
yeah, i suppose. but it sure beats
working a brothel in the city, huh?
here we get to eat as much as we want,
and the men don't bother us!
- <i>unless we want 'em to!</i>
-<i>[laughing]</i>
<i>[wind howling]</i>
[squeaking]
[growling]
- no!
- but you can't leave tomorrow.
- can't you stay a little longer?
- you can stay and work here.
thank you all, but there's
someone i have to find
out there in the forest.
[gasps]
[murmuring]
- she's here.
- oh!
the wolves are coming.
it's the wolf princess!

[grunts, pants]
[grunting]
[screaming]
- [gasps]
- [panting]

i'm a friend.
<i>here! she's here!</i>
-<i>she's on the roof!.</i>
- hurry! she's after lady eboshi!
-<i>somebody cut her off!.</i>
-<i>she's headed for the forge!</i>
<i>[poles clattering]</i>
keep stoking those fires!
riflemen to the stockade.
we've got her right where we want her.
a weapon for every man!
everyone defends irontown!
- toki, she's on the roof.
- [gasping]
now, don't get excited.
keep those bellows working.
whatever happens, we can't
let those fires go out.
- is she alone?
- yes.
she can't escape.
we have her cornered.
you know she means
to kill you this time.
we'll see about that.
come on.
-<i>[man] get a weapon!</i>
-<i>[man #2] move! move!</i>
make room for milady!
can you hear me,
princess of beasts?
if it's me you want,
here i am.
<i>if you seek revenge for</i>
<i>all the animals we've killed,</i>
well, there are two women down
here whom i'd like you to meet.
they want revenge as well for
husbands killed by your wolves.
come on out, you little witch!
my husband's dead because of you!
huh?
<i>[man] there she is!</i>
- it's her!
- there she is!
[gonza]
everybody out of the way!
riflemen, get ready to fire!
it's a trap. no! wait!
princess of the wolf gods!
don't go down there!
go back to the forest!
listen to me, please!
don't throw your life away!
- shall i stop him?
- leave him be.
let him do what he likes.
<i>[wolf howling]</i>
[grunts]
<i>[groaning]</i>
[gasps]
she's down! we got her!
[laughs]
stay back.
cut off a wolf s head,
and it still has the power to bite.
what?
- take aim where she falls.
- right.
[grunting]
open fire.
[ringing]
- yeah!
- [shouting]
no! stay back!
oh! what the devil was that?
[grunts]
wake up.
-<i>[shouts]</i>
- no!
- [growling]
- [murmuring]
[gasping]
[shouting]
[murmuring]
[shouts]
- skin her!
- kill her, milady! kill her!
[grunting]
- are you all right, sir?
can i help you?
- i'm fine. fine.
<i>[crowd shouting]</i>
- [grunts] get away from me!
- [whimpers]
- begone!
- yes, sir!
<i>huh?</i>
traitor! you're a spy
for the wolves, aren't you?
stay back!
oh! halt!
step aside.
[whimpering]
- [shouting]
- [man screams]
[screams]
[grunting]
[grunting]
- what do you think you're doing, boy?
- stay your hand.
the girl's life is now mine.
[growling]
i'm sure she'll make
a lovely wife for you.
there's a demon inside of you.
it's inside both of you.
[growls, gasps]
[gasping]
look, everyone!
this is what hatred looks like.
this is what it does
when it catches hold of you.
it's eating me alive,
and very soon now it will kill me!
fear and anger only
make it grow faster.
i'm getting a little bored of
this curse of yours, ashitaka.
let me just cut
the damn thing off!.
- [gasps]
- [crowd murmurs]
[grunting, gasps]
lady eboshi!
someone come here
and take her from me.
- [gasping]
- milady!
don't worry.
she's just stunned.
she'll be all right.
<i>[woman]</i>
<i>lady eboshi?</i>
as for me, i'm leaving,
and i'm taking the wolf girl!
oh, no, you're not!
nobody treats my lady eboshi like that!
move and i fire!
kiyo, what are you doing?
how can he
still be walking?
[whimpers]
- is she all right?
- yes, milady's safe, sir.
someone bring me my gun!
riflemen to the square now,
on the double!
they're not getting
out of here alive!
toki, come here.
[gasps]
what? what's happened?
sir, i can't let you pass.
the gate's been ordered shut.
it can't be opened.
turn back, please.
we're grateful to you for bringing
those men back to us.
- we don't want to hurt you.
- please!
i walked in through this gate
this morning. now i'm going
to leave the same way.
don't be a fool.
it takes ten men to open this gate.
[gasps]
stop it! you'll kill yourself.
- [creaking]
- huh?
[gasping]
out of the way!
[gasps]
the wolves are attacking!
flint!
she's all right!
your princess is safe with me!
[growling]
stay and i will bring her!
come on, yakul.
you have my thanks.
good luck, stranger.
[gasping]
[growling]
<i>stop it!</i>
leave him!
he's mine!
oof!.
his own people shot him.
he's dying.
[groans]
why did you stop me from killing her?
tell me while you're still alive.
i didn't want them to kill you.
that's why.
i'm not afraid to die. i'd do anything
to get you humans out of my forest.
i knew that from
the first moment i saw you.
and i'm not afraid of you!
i should kill you for saving her!
<i>[grunts]</i>
that woman is evil, and there's no one
who can stop me from killing her.
no. live.
that's enough! i'm not
listening to you anymore!
you're beautiful.
[gasps]
what is it, san?
want me to crunch his face off?
- [gasps]
- [growls]
<i>[san]</i>
<i>the ape tribe.</i>
all right!
what do you want here?
apes, how dare you show such
disrespect to the wolf clan.
this is our forest.
the human--
give him to us.
give us the human and go.
you go before
my fangs find you.
- we will not go.
- we will eat the human.
yes, let us eat
the man creature.
are you crazy?
just what happened to make
the ape tribe change this way?
since when do apes
eat the flesh of a man?
if we eat the human,
we will steal his strength,
and we will drive
the other humans away.
give us
the man creature.
stop this. you know you can't possess
the humans' strength by eating them.
all that'll do is make you
into something else,
something even worse
than human.
we plant trees. humans tear them up.
the forest does not come back.
if we kill the humans,
we will save the forest.
you mustn't give up. we'll find a way.
the forest spirit is with us.
go on planting your trees
and someday we'll beat them.
the forest spirit will not fight.
we will all die.
wolf girl does not care.
she is human.
- [ringing]
- enough!
i'll bite your head off,
you chattering ape.
<i>[san]</i>
<i>stop! wait! come back!</i>
leave them alone!
<i>[footfalls approaching]</i>
don't worry about them.
it's all right.
you two go on ahead now.
i'll stay here and deal with the human.
- what about the elk?
- yes.
<i>can we eat him?</i>
<i>[pants]</i>
no, you may not.
go home!
[growls]
come over here.
don't worry. i'm a friend.
don't be shy. i won't hurt you.
i need you to help me carry him.
- <i>please?</i>
- [snorts]
<i>[chirping]</i>
[snorts, lows]
you are very wise.
you know better than to set foot
on this island, don't you?
ugh! i smell like a human.
you can go wherever you want to.
you're free now.
[clicking]
[clicking]
<i>[clicking continues]</i>
[gasps]
finally.
there he is.
come and see. hurry.
quick, you idiots.
it's the nightwalker.
he's the reason we've
been sitting around in these
stinking animal skins, you know.
but sir, we can't.
it's a sin to look at it.
ha. and you call yourself
the greatest hunter in the west.
look. we've got a letter
of pardon from the emperor,
forgiving us for cutting off the head
of the great forest spirit.
<i>[clicking]</i>
the legends tell us that
when day becomes night,
the forest spirit turns
into the nightwalker,
and at sunrise,
it changes back.
look! see there?
it's happening.
<i>[clicking continues]</i>
- take a look, masterjigo.
- what is it?
- over there.
- hmph.
[birds twittering]
look. there must be hundreds of them.
those boars are not
from this region.
they must have been traveling for months
to get all the way up here.
- that one's okkoto!
- can't be.
they say he died
it's him, all right.
i know those old tusks.
<i>and it looks like he brought</i>
<i>along his whole tribe.</i>
[whimpers] he's seen us!
let's get out of here!
[squeals]
[squealing]
come on, you cowards!
move! quickly!
<i>[birds twittering]</i>
[groans]
[gasps]
the bullet wound's gone.
[grunts]
yakul.
[lows]
the mark's still there.
finally you're awake.
you really should thank yakul. he hasn't
left your side this whole time.
[grunts]
how'd you know his name's yakul?
he told me,
and he told me about you--
about your village,
your people and your forest.
the forest spirit
brought you back to life again.
he wants you to live.
i had the strangest dream.
- there was a golden creature.
- eat this.
[coughs]
chew.
[coughs]
[grunts]
<i>[rustling]</i>
<i>[rumbling]</i>
[squealing]
we are here to <i>kill</i> the humans
and save the forest.
why are there
humans here, moro?
humans are everywhere
these days.
go back to your own mountain.
kill them there.
the girl is san, my daughter.
we will kill them <i>here.</i>
we will save <i>this</i> forest.
what is that other human
doing here?
he was shot, and then the great spirit
healed his wound.
this man is not our enemy!
the forest spirit saved <i>him</i> ?
saved the life
of that loathsome runt?
<i>why didn't he save nago?</i>
<i>is he not the guardian</i>
<i>of the forest? why?</i>
the forest spirit gives life
and takes life away.
life and death are his alone,
or have you boars forgotten that?
you lie! you must have begged
the forest spirit to spare his life!
but you did not beg
for nago, did you?
<i>[moro]</i>
<i>nago was afraid to die.</i>
<i>now i, too, carry within my breast</i>
<i>a poisoned human bullet.</i>
nago fled,
and the darkness took him.
i remain and contemplate my death.
mother! please ask
the forest spirit to save you.
i have lived long enough, san.
soon the forest spirit
will let me rest forever.
all these years you
defended the forest spirit!
he must save you!
you are not fooling us.
nago was beautiful and strong.
he would not have run from anything.
you wolves must have eaten him!
quiet! watch what you say,
you filthy pig!
<i>[ashitaka] gods of the mountain,</i>
<i>please listen to me.</i>
nago died far from here,
and i was the one who killed him.
he had become
some kind of demon.
one day he attacked
our village.
if you want proof,
look at my hand where he touched me.
i came here to beg the forest spirit
to lift nago's curse from me.
he healed the bullet wound in my side,
but the demon mark remains.
first it will tear my soul apart,
and then it will kill me.
[squealing]
okkoto, finally,
a boar who will listen to reason.
no, lord okkoto, wait!
please, you mustn't eat him.
ah, you are moro's
human child, aren't you?
i have heard of you.
[gasps] you're blind.
stand back.
i will not eat him.
<i>it's all right, san.</i>
my lord okkoto, what i said about
nago's death was the truth.
[grunts]
i believe you,
and i thank you for it, young one.
i am only grieved and ashamed that such
a demon has come from our tribe.
[whimpers]
o mighty lord, is there a way
to lift nago's curse from me?
leave this forest...
for the next time we meet
i will have to kill you.
you cannot win against the humans.
their guns will destroy you all.
look on my tribe, moro.
we grow small,
and we grow stupid.
we will soon be nothing
but squealing game...
that the humans
hunt for their meat.
you'd risk everything
on one last battle?
that's just
what the humans want.
i do not ask for the help
of the wolf tribe.
even if every one of us dies,
it will be a battle
the humans will never forget.
<i>[squealing]</i>
[squealing continues]
<i>[squealing fades]</i>
the forest spirit.
- [mooing]
- hyah! hyah!
come on! keep your oxen together!
hurry!
[shouting]
get ready now.
little bit closer. fire!
[shouting]
reload! fire!
attack--
ready--
well, i see somebody
is going to have to go
play the peacemaker.
take our riflemen
and hide behind the cliffs.
yes, sir.
- let's go.
-<i>and stay there</i>
<i>till i send for you.</i>
come on! let's keep the oxen moving!
we have to get back to irontown!
- there they are!
- where?
coming around the pass.
the hunters are ready, sir.
excellent.
well done, my boy.
go and spread the word.
we'll be moving out presently.
yes, sir.
greetings,jigo.
well, i've got the emperor
breathing down my neck,
and you're busy playing war
with lord asano.
and you would have nothing to do
with lord asano being here,
now, would you?
of course not.
whatever made you think that?
he'll call a truce
if i give him half my iron.
is that right?
well, he's a greedy bastard, isn't he?
but all the same, you might as well
let him have his iron.
listen, eboshi, the boars
are gathering for battle.
and you know what that means.
<i>you made me a promise.</i>
<i>now, once you get me</i>
<i>the head of the forest spirit,</i>
<i>then we can come back</i>
<i>and destroy lord asano together, huh?</i>
watch out, milady!
there's a horseman coming! get in!
well, speak of the devil,
a messenger from lord asano.
- we have guests.
mind your manners, ladies.
- yes, ma'am.
- welcome back, milady!
-<i>[creaking]</i>
whoa! wait!
won't you even talk to the man?
[whinnying]
lady eboshi,
mistress of irontown!
i bring a message to you
from my lord asano.
<i>you have fought valiantly and well.</i>
<i>now, open your gates</i>
<i>that we may speak with you.</i>
hmph! we can hear you
just fine from down there.
milady took this mountain away
from the gods, the boars and beasts!
and now that it's worth
something, you want it!
- <i>well,you won't get it!</i>
- the brazen impudence!
you ladies need to be
taught some respect!
respect? what's that?
we haven't had any respect
since the day we were born!
[all blowing raspberries]
you want some of our iron?
here ya go!
- [shouts]
- [whinnies]
[laughing]
[laughs]
they are really something.
they'll fight forest gods or samurai.
it doesn't matter to them.
they're an amazing bunch, your girls.
they were wasted in the brothels.
impressive for
a piece of paper.
well, you know, it's gotten me all
the best hunters and trappers around.
remember, my dear lady,
we're after a god, not just a beast.
<i>girls, come here.</i>
yes, milady, what is it?
do you have any idea
who this paper has come from?
from the emperor himself.
- that's nice. who's he?
- is he supposed to be important?
- <i>i'm serious. who's he? should we know?</i>
- yes! they're really something.
- [chuckles]
- thank you.
yes, milady.
every day that we cut trees
and dig for iron, the forest
and its creatures grow weaker.
my way, there is
no loss of life,jigo.
listen, you owe me
and i've come to collect.
when you needed riflemen,
i sent them, and without those riflemen,
you lose irontown.
oh, i'm sorry.
did that sound like a threat?
don't tell me
the emperor believes...
that wives' tale about
the great spirit's head
granting immortality.
i'm sure i don't know
what the emperor believes.
i'm just a humble monk.
i'm just trying to get by.
i keep my promises.
anyway, we have fought the boars before.
they're much easier to kill
than moro and her wolf cubs,
so you can call out
that shady bunch you've got
hidden under the cliff,jigo.
[laughs]
so i've been found out.
oh,just one more thing, milady.
<i>did a stranger come through here,</i>
<i>by any chance?</i>
he's a young man
riding a great big red elk.
came and went.
a bad-looking bunch,
if you ask me.
those men are
no ordinary hunters.
- they're killers.
- killers?
milady, at least let
some of us go with you.
yes, you can't trust these men.
they're strangers.
what if something goes wrong
and we're stuck here?
we can't help you.
you said yourself we're better shots
than the men are.
that's precisely why i want
you all here in irontown.
i can deal with forest gods.
it's humans i'm worried about.
once the forest spirit is dead,
we don't know what will happen.
willjigo be satisfied
with the creature's head...
or will he be after
my ironworks as well?
jigo's riflemen
may turn on us.
if that happens, i'll need
every one of you here to fight them.
<i>remember,</i>
<i>you can't trust men.</i>
don't worry
about her ladyship.
i'll be right at her side,
protecting her.
- that's what we're afraid of.
- what?
even if you were a woman,
you'd still be an idiot!

as soon as your strength returns,
the mark will spread and destroy you.
it feels like i must
have been asleep for weeks.
i had a dream that san
was by my side, nursing me.
i was hoping you'd cry out
in your sleep.
then i would have bitten
your head off to silence you.
it's a beautiful forest. are okkoto
and the boars on the move yet?
yes, the boars are marching.
the trees cry out as they die,
but you cannot hear them.
i lie here.
i listen to the pain of the forest...
and feel the ache
of the bullet in my chest...
and dream of the day when i will
finally crunch that gun woman's
head in my jaws.
moro, why can't the humans
and the forest live together?
why can't we stop
this fighting now?
the humans are gathering
for the final battle.
the flames of their guns
will burn us all.
and what happens to san?
what's your plan,
to let her die with you?
typical. selfish.
you think like a human.
san is my daughter.
she is of the wolf tribe.
when the forest dies,
so does she.
you must set her free!
she's not a wolf!. she's human!
silence, boy.
how dare you speak
to a god like that.
i caught her human parents
defiling my forest.
they threw their baby
at my feet as they ran away.
<i>instead of eating her,</i>
<i>i raised her as my own.</i>
<i>now, my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter</i>
<i>is neither human nor wolf.</i>
how could you help her?
i don't know, but at least
we might find a way to live.
[laughing] how?
will you join forces with san
and fight the humans?
no. all that would do
is cause more hatred.
there is nothing
you can do, boy.
soon the demon mark
will spread and kill you.
leave this place at sunrise.
return and i shall kill you.

i have another favor to ask!
will you please give this

it's that damn woman again.
<i>[pounding continues]</i>
she knows we're out here.
- it's a trap and a stupid one.
- what?
they're trying to lure
the boars out of the forest.
- no.
- the humans are planning something.
then we have to find okkoto
while there's still time to stop
him or else they'll be killed!
okkoto is too stubborn.
he won't listen. none of them will.
they may even know it's a trap.
the boars are a proud race.
the last one left alive will still
be charging blindly forward.
[squeals]
- why chop the trees down?
- <i>to make them angry,</i>
<i>which makes them stupid.</i>
mother, i have to go.
okkoto's blind.
i must be his eyes.
you understand?
do as you must.
you know that boy wanted to share
his life with you.
i hate him!
i hate all humans!
from ashitaka for me?
- [ringing]
- pretty.

- are you all right?
- <i>we're all right.</i>
lord asano's samurai thought
they'd try and ambush us
while our men were away.
- thought we'd just roll over.
- <i>but we showed them!</i>
- <i>we sure did!</i>
- where's lady eboshi?
she took every able-bodied man
and went to kill the forest spirit.
we're cut off here. we can't even
get a message to lady eboshi.
the forest spirit.
that explains the explosions.
hey, sir, i've still
got your bow and arrows!
aren't you gonna tell him
you've got his cloak and saddle too?
- oh, i do?
- oh, you're useless.
many thanks, kohroku!

can you hold out?
don't worry! we can always pour
hot iron on them.
- bring back lady eboshi!
- and don't take too long!

- oh, it was horrible, horrible.
- irontown has come under attack.
- what?
the women and the lepers
have fallen back to the inner wall.
- we haven't got a lot of time.
- those samurai bastards.
asano must have just been waiting
for us to leave irontown.
now i must find lady eboshi.
she's off hunting down
the forest spirit.
then someone's got
to stop her, call her back.
if you're all done,
i want you out of here.
the rest of you, keep digging!
- wait! what about irontown?
- that's right! it's our home!
what do they expect us to do,
just abandon irontown?
you heard the boy!
we haven't a moment to lose.
- send a message to lady eboshi!
- the forest is too big!
no messenger would have
a chance of finding her!
then send out a hunter!
what else are they good for?
lady eboshi
is just being used byjigo.
tell me something.
when you fought with the boars,
were there any wolves with them?
did you see san,
the wolf girl?
i have no idea. it was pitch black
when the animals came at us.
she was there.
i saw her.
i was right in the front line.
i saw everything, everything.
- what happened?
- i'm not sure!
everything started happening so fast.
it was like a nightmare.
jigo's troops put us in front
as bait to lure the boars in.
they didn't tell us
about the land mines under our feet...
or the grenades
coming in on top of us.
- [screaming]
- [squealing]
[screaming]
[gasps]
[growling]
huh?
<i>[growling]</i>
where is she?
where's san?
take it easy.
i'm trying to get you out.
-<i>[growling continues]</i>
- there's a wolf over here!
hey! hurry!
young master, what are you doing?
[growling]
- what's going on?
- no! what do you think you're doing?
i have got to find lady eboshi.
this wolf s gonna help me find her.
you're on their side,
aren't you, boy?
stand aside!
what's more important
to all of you?
the head of the forest spirit
or saving your town?
- those darts are poison.
- [grunts]
[growling]
- that's enough now!
- [grunts]
i'm not gonna
slave any longer!
[shouting]
come on!
let's get this thing off of him!
all together now!
- [grunts]
- <i>heave! heave!</i>
- [grunting continues]
- <i>heave!</i>
- <i>heave!</i>
- [growling]
look out!
after you've come through the swamp,
take cover by the lake
until we get there.
- [together] right!
- be careful.
those riflemen with milady
belong tojigo.
here. take these. where i'm going,
they won't be of any use.
you go with them, yakul.
look after him!
find san!
that's where we'll find eboshi!
come on. keep moving.
straight ahead. today we finish this.
- sir.
- yes? ah, have you spotted them?
okkoto's badly wounded.
he and the wolf girl
are making their way to
the realm of the forest spirit.
so they're going to beg him
for his help, are they?
keep after them,
<i>but stay out of sight or you'll</i>
<i>frighten the forest spirit away.</i>
yes, sir. i understand.
that was boar's blood
painted on his face, wasn't it?
uh-huh, a little trade secret.
don't want to smell human.
[labored breathing]
we're almost at the pool
of the forest spirit.
just a little farther.
keep going.
[gasps, groans]
-<i>[rustling]</i>
- what was that?
lord okkoto, something's wrong.
we have to keep moving.
- something's out there.
- what? with so much blood
in the air, i can't smell it.
-<i>[rustling]</i>
- [gasps]
[gasps, grunts]
i should have known it was you!
- you did this!
- because of you, the forest will die!
you're wrong!
we've all been fighting to save it!
this is the thanks you give us?
- you bring bad things!
- bad things coming,
neither human or animal.
- what do you mean,
"neither human or animal?"
-<i>[squeaking]</i>
[squeaking]
- they're coming!
- it's the end for us!
[gasps]
- they're warriors.
- [sniffing]
they've come back.
- [gasps]
- my warriors!
they have come back to me
from the land of the dead.
[roars]
- forward, my warriors!
- okkoto, listen!
- forward to the pool
of the forest spirit!
- okkoto, no, wait!
- [gasps]
- [growling]
no, lord okkoto!
your warriors haven't come back to you.
those are humans wearing
the skins of your warriors
to hide their scent!
<i>it's a trick!</i>
don't you understand?
it's just a human trick to get us
to lead them to the forest spirit!
<i>[san gasps]</i>
come out, forest spirit!
if you are truly master here,
give my warriors the power to slay
the humans and be victorious!
stop, lord okkoto, please!
you've got to listen!
san, they're all around us.
okkoto's done for. leave him!
no! i won't let him turn
into a demon like nago did!
tell mother that the humans are setting
a trap for the forest spirit.
<i>she'll know what to do.</i>
you'll have to hurry,
or it could mean the end of all of us!
go on now.
[grunts]
- [grunts]
- [labored breathing]
stay back or you die!
and then this whole forest
will see just what you are!
<i>[wolf howling]</i>
[howling]
-<i>[howling continues]</i>
- ashitaka?
- [shrieking]
- get back!
[grunting]
i burn!
there are flames growing inside of me.
[screams]
you must fight it!
don't let yourself become a demon!
lord okkoto!
[groans]
what is it?
<i>[wolf howling]</i>
- is it san?
- she's in danger.
let's go.
[roaring]
[roaring]
[gasping]
i'm on fire.
[grunting]
[grunts, screams]
[gasping]
no! i don't want
to become a demon!
please stop, okkoto!
[roaring]
you're too slow! get on!
- [grunts]
- [shouting]
- a wolf!.
- hey!
- eboshi!
- [grunts]
[grunts]
[grunts]
you keep going!
eboshi!
i have something to say!
- hold your fire!
- what is it you want?
lord asano's samurai
have attacked irontown!
the women are outnumbered!
they can't hold them off for long!
<i>forget about</i>
<i>the forest spirit!</i>
your men are already
heading back to irontown,
but they need you to lead them!
what proof is there
this isn't a lie?
lie? don't be ridiculous!
what reason do i have to lie?
so it's don't kill the forest gods.
now you want us to kill samurai instead.
no! what i want is for the humans
and the forest to live in peace!
-just whose side is he on anyway?
- shouldn't we go back?
the women are on their own now.
i've done all i can for them.
they can take care
of themselves.
there's the pool.
the creature must be somewhere nearby.
it's the moment of truth, boys,
so keep your eyes peeled.
why do we need
that woman, sir?
when you're going to kill a god,
let someone else do your dirty work.
[grunts]
moro, what happened to you?
san! it's me, ashitaka!
san!
[roaring]
-<i>san!</i>
- [gasps]
ashitaka!
[gasps]
okkoto?
turned into a demon.
[roaring]
[man] leave, boy.
fight me and the forest spirit
will never come.
<i>[okkoto roaring]</i>
lord okkoto, calm your fury!
o mighty lord, let me have the girl!
i beg of you! please, let her go!
san! are you there?
it's me! ashitaka!
[roaring]
- san!
- [roaring]
[screams]
kill him!
san!
[grunting]
stop him!
he'll ruin everything!
- [growling]
- [screaming]
san!
[grunting]
[roaring]
- [grunting]
- [grunting]
[shouting]
san!
[grunting]
san!
oh, ashitaka!
[roaring]
- san!
- ashitaka!
and here i was saving
the last of my strength...
to bite off that damn woman's head.
but i must save san.
close ranks!
use your grenades!
[roaring]
[roaring continues]
don't touch him.
he's no longer a god.
[roaring]
[roaring]
you can't even speak,
can you?
well done, men. now, fall back
and get the wounded out of here.
go on.
ooh, what a revolting spectacle.
hmm.
it's him.
[roaring]
[roaring continues]
give me back my daughter, demon.
- [growling]
- [roaring]
<i>[roaring continues]</i>
ashitaka,
can you save the girl you love?
[gasps]
the forest spirit.
[gasps]
eboshi! hold your fire!
huh?
eboshi! your enemy's
not the forest spirit.
- but that should have killed it.
- he's a god.
it'll take more than one shot.
san! [grunts]
[grunts]
don't die.
[moaning]
i don't get it.
the great forest spirit
took their lives away.
huh?
- quick! he's starting to change.
- now watch closely, everyone.
i'm going to show you
how to kill a god,
<i>a god of life and death.</i>
the trick is not to fear him.
no! stop!
- [grunts]
- eboshi!
- [clicks]
- [gasps]
you will die!
[gasps]
[grunting]
she did it! quickly!
go get the head!
[screaming]
quick,jigo!
bring me that box of yours!
the porters are all dead!
hurry! hurry!
be careful not
to touch the spirit's body!
it'll suck the life out of you!
here it is!
one head, as promised!
- [gasps, grunts]
- watch out!
[screams]
milady!
i told you.
a wolf s head can still bite.
come on!
we got to get out of here.
- hurry!
- it's coming, sir!
- run!
- run!
[gonza whimpers]
[gasps] gonza, we've got
to get to the island!
- island? i can't swim!
- then walk along the bottom.
[inhales deeply]
[gasps]
[gasps]
give her to me!
i'll cut her throat!
your claim has been avenged.
your mother saw to that. here.
- lady eboshi.
- help me. [grunts]
don't waste your sympathy.
ow!
- i promised toki that
i'd bring you back to irontown.
-<i>[crashing]</i>
[growling]
he's searching for his head.
we can't stay here.
san, you have got to help us.
no! you're on their side!
you always were!
take that damn woman
and just go away!
san?
never!
i hate all of you humans!
yes, i'm human, san,
and so are you.
stop it!
i'm a wolf, you hear?
- san?
- stay back!
[gasps] oh.
i'm sorry.
i tried to stop it.
[growling]
it's over. everything's over.
the forest is dead.
nothing is over.
the two of us are still alive.
now, will you help me, san?
<i>[jigo] hey, wait!</i>
<i>come back! help us!</i>
a little crisis
and they panic. whoa!
whoa! what are you doing?
this way!
[screaming]
[groans]
look! the head is moving!
- it's calling him to us!
- [grunting]
<i>[tapping]</i>
-<i>[tapping continues]</i>
- <i>there you go.</i>
- it shouldn't jam anymore.
- thanks.
- it's awfully quiet.
- asano is waiting for sunrise.
i wonder if that young man
ever found lady eboshi.
don't worry about him.
he found her, all right.
they'll be marching
over that hill any minute now.
- [snores, yawns]
- big dope. don't ask me why i love him.
- hey, kohroku!
- let him sleep, toki, while he can.
-<i>[rumbling]</i>
- huh?
- what's that?
- i don't know, but i don't like it.
it's the nightwalker!
[shouting]
- [shouting]
- [crashing]
[whinnying]
everybody, hold your positions!
- toki, it's coming right at us.
- run! we've gotta go!
<i>[toki] no! we promised lady eboshi</i>
<i>we would defend irontown!</i>
look! over there!
he's come back!
get everyone out!
the great spirit's head's been cut off,
and he wants it back!
<i>if that black ooze touches you,</i>
<i>you're dead!</i>
<i>run for the lake!</i>
<i>the water will slow it down!</i>
lady eboshi and the men
are on their way from the other side.
i'm gonna try to return his head
before he kills us all. hurry!
- what are we gonna do now?
- it'll kill us all!
- we'll never get out now!
- that's enough!
get everyone down to the lake
and stay calm. we can carry
the sick and the wounded.
[screaming]
- not that way! stop!
- [screaming]
[whimpering]
oh! there it goes!
we're done for!
once the forge burns, that's it.
that'll be the end of irontown.
we're still alive, kohroku.
we'll manage somehow. now, let's go.
there they are!
go!
stop right there!
whoa! oh, you're both alive.
oh, how nice.
i'm giving the creature back its head.
put the box down and back away.
give the head back now?
come on, boy. don't be silly.
now, when the sun's
about to come up?
look! he's a brainless,
swollen, life-sucking god of death.
<i>at sunrise he'll vanish.</i>
sir, it's coming!
we've gotta get out of here!
look, everybody wants everything.
that's the way the world is.
but i might
actually get it.
don't force me to kill you.
oh, dear, you make it sound
so very easy.
you really
ought to... relax!
- [growls]
- [both grunting]
get going!
[grunting]
- [groans]
- [panting]
[whimpering]
- [whimpering]
- oh!
ashitaka!
i got it! whoa! ooh!
everything's-- oof!.
under control! oof!.
this is bad.
master, we're surrounded!
[screams]
- come on, sun! rise!
- open the box!
don't you see?
it's too late for that now!
why are you wasting
your breath talking to <i>him</i> ?
- human hands must return it!
- [groans]
[grunts]
don't say i didn't warn you.
[gasps]
forest spirit!
we give you back your head!
take it and be at peace!
uh, well, that got
his attention, all right.
[gasping]
well, i think it's over.
-<i>[man] hello!</i>
- it's the men.
- [shouting]
- <i>the men! the men are back!</i>
i really can't believe we made it.
i never thought i'd live
to see home again.
<i>[wind howling]</i>
- milady! you're here!
- her ladyship has been injured.
look! it's falling on irontown!
[toki] hang on tight, everybody!
don't let go!
huh? i didn't know the forest spirit
made the flowers grow.
[moans]
[gasps] san. san, look.
even if all the trees return,
it won't be his forest anymore.
the great forest spirit is dead now.
never. he's life itself.
he's not dead, san.
he's here right now,
trying to tell us something,
that it's time
for us both to live.
ashitaka, you mean so much to me,
but i can't forgive the humans
for what they've done.
i understand. you'll live in the forest,
and i'll go help them rebuild irontown.
i'll always be near.
yakul and i will come and visit you...
<i>whenever we can, all right?</i>
amazing. the wolves and
that crazy little wolf girl
helped save us all.
ashitaka. can someone find him?
i need to thank him.
we're going to start all over again.
this time we'll build a better town.
well, i give up!
you can't win against fools!!
