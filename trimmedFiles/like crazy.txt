<i>[woman]
publications like rolling stone and spare rib</i>
were created to feed the need
for alternative narratives from the
established newspapers of the day.
in much the same way, the pauper <i>press</i>
of the 1790s in england was developed
out of a need for mass representation
for the popular classes.
those magazines and fanzines
of the '60s and '70s also provided
a means of reaching
beyond the official
and thus, ultimately,
beyond the ruling classes.
the internet, in contrast,
no longer requires there to be
any notion of the group.
its concern is wholly
with the individual.
it is with lucrative serendipity,
or perhaps just good branding,
that myspace is so called.
the juxtaposition suggests
that the act of the individual
in defining their cyberspace
borders is more important
than what it is filled with.
it is simply 'your space.'.
for the end of monetized
mass communication
is the end of the press baron
champagne baths.
[man] thank you, anna.
very provocative. well done.
does anyone else
have a presentation to make?
[students chattering]
[man] all right, make sure you turn
in your final packet to jacob.
and thank you very much.
hi.
i don't need to give you mine,
because i've already done it.
[jacob] cool.
- cool.
[chuckles]
if she comes to invite
wearing the same dress as me,
- i will completely freak out!
- hey, yeah... yeah.
no, it was ok.
it was fine.
<i>[woman] sweetheart,
i really miss you so much.</i>
mum, can you just...
i'll speak to you in a minute. i have
someone waiting on the other line.
<i>all right, darling. i miss you.</i>
- <i>i love you.</i>
- <i>ok, ok, ok, bye</i>
[phone beeps]
- hello?
[man] hi, anna?
<i>- it's jacob.
- hi.</i>
[anna] it didn't freak you out?
i guess you wouldn't
be here if it had.
no, it was nice.
and it was funny.
it was kind of great. i don't think
you're a nutcase, by the way, at all.
i thought i'd better
put that, just in case.
- that was a good disclaimer.
- yeah, i just wanted to set that out.
- "no nutcases here."
- yeah.
[laughs]
- whoa.
these cups are huge.
they're like reservoirs.
it's almost bigger
than my face. [giggles]
yeah, so what do you...
what's your major?
furniture design.
that's why you're always drawing.
yeah. you like to write then?
yeah, yeah. i mean,
journalism is probably what i
would want to kind of go into
when i graduate. i don't know.
who knows what we're going
to do when we leave.
you mean permanently when we leave?
like when we're dead? we'll be dead.
[laughs] when we leave.
when we depart this planet.
[both laugh]
so are you going to
stay in la after school?
yeah, i'd like to,
if i can sort out my visa stuff.
so you grew up with
your mum and dad?
- my mom.
- and your dad?
he passed away when i was ten.
[anna] now, that's shitty.
- yeah. it's quite shitty.
and what about you?
yeah, my parents,
i'm very close to them.
it's only ever been...
i'm an only child, so...
me, too.
yeah, so i'm quite close to them.
but it's nice being away.
i think it's important to...
to get away from where you've
grown up for some of your life.
i was thinking about
leaving right now, actually.
[laughs]
let's go.
where do you want to go?
um, do you want to come up?
[whispering] she likes
to go to bed early.
oh, no, that's terrible!
so i try not to make too much noise.
do you want a drink?
i only have whiskey.
yeah.
- i don't drink much... actually.
[liquid pours]
cheers.
[exhales deeply] [chuckles]
- it's strong. [laughs]
- mm.
- is that the chair where you write?
- yeah.
it's not very comfortable.
[laughs] it does the job.
- you like paul simon?
- yeah.
- do you?
- yeah, i love paul simon.
- really?
- yeah, i love graceland.
[laughs] oh!
- it's so good.
- that's my favorite album.
[♪ paul simon: "crazy love, vol. ll"]
would you mind reading me something?
what do you want me to read?
something you wrote.
ok.
- you're not allowed to laugh.
- i'm not gonna laugh.
i haven't read it out loud yet.
so you'll be the first person.
- you sure you want to hear it?
- mmmm.
"i thought i understood it."
that i could grasp it.
but i didn't.
not really.
only the 'smudgeness' of it.
the pink-slippered, all-containered,
semi-precious eagerness of it.
i didn't realize it would
sometimes be more than whole.
that the wholeness
was a rather luxurious idea.
because it's the halves
that halve you in half.
didn't know. don't know
about the in-between bits.
"the gory bits of you
and gory bits of me."
i like "the halves
that halve you in half."
[giggles] it's a bit childish.
- no.
no.

bernard, stop it. this is something
i just have to ask. i'm sorry.
- we're very open in our house.
- you don't have to answer.
- we're not that open. we are not.
- we are!
we talk... you may not be open,
but anna and i are.
we talk about everything. i'm sorry.
i have to tell you this right now.
so don't be embarrassed.
you are being grown up?
- you are being adults?
[laughs]
[bernard] you do not have to answer.
[anna] yes.
thank you. that's all i needed
to know. that's perfect.
jacob, do you like whiskey?
just to change the subject completely.
- that is a very good idea.
- i'm learning. anna's been teaching me.
she's an expert. of course,
she learned from the master.
what's your favorite
that we've tried?
- la... laphroaig.
[bernard] laphroaig!
- i love laphroaig. it's my favorite.
- she does.
- it's great.
[bernard] that's very sophisticated.
- drive safe. bye-bye.
- bye-bye.

<i>[jacob] ok. close your eyes.
[anna] why?</i>
because. close your eyes.
[laughs]
- close your eyes.
close them. count to 60.

i can sense you've
brought something.
thank you. thank you.
- it's my chair.
- mmmm.
look underneath.
it's your first one.
i love you...
like crazy.
[whispering] what are we going
to do after we graduate?
we... we'll sort something out.
don't think about it now.
i'll come back
and i'll get a work visa.
i hate thinking about it.
i'm not gonna leave.
- promise.
- ok.
yeah. yeah.
<i>[mother] sweetheart, you all packed?
[anna] yeah, pretty much.</i>
i just can't believe it's tomorrow.
the time's gone so quickly.
<i>you certainly left it
to the last minute.</i>
well, it's difficult,
because i won't see jacob
- for the whole summer, so...
- how's he doing?
he's good.
he's just in the shower.
he's got his website up and running,
so he's pleased about that.
<i>darling, i know
you're going to miss him.</i>
yeah, i just wish i could
stay a bit longer, that's all.
<i>anna, darling, dad told you what the
lawyer said about overstaying the visa.</i>
<i>this is important.
you know that.</i>
yeah, i know.
those are the rules.
<i>we'll get things sorted
over the summer.</i>
<i>then you can go back to la
after sarah's wedding.</i>
yeah, i know. so, um...
i'll see you tomorrow, mum.
i'd better get going.
<i>yeah, we can't wait.
we can't wait!</i>
yeah. bye, mum.
are they excited
that you're coming back?
[anna] yeah, they can't wait.
my mum is very excited.
mm. i'm glad that we're
getting away for a...
for a night.
but we'll come back here
on the way back,
- before i go to the airport?
- yeah.
- what time is the boat?
- 10:30.
- we haven't got that much time.
- don't worry. it's ok.
i'm not worried.
[♪ soft piano music]
[jacob] wow.
ow!
- what happened? you ok?
- ow! yeah.
- i just caught my finger.
- let me see.
- it's ok. it's fine.

there's nothing to see!
i just hit it.
- i caught it in there.

[jacob] so, uh...
what are you doing on catalina?
you look like a fisherman.
are you a fisherman?
no?
do you fish?
i love to fish.
i'm just trying to read, jacob.
mm. that's fine.
fine with me.
it's a fine island.
it's a fine island for reading.
<i>that's my yacht, the ahi.</i>
yeah, i like tuna.
i like tuna a lot.
i like tuna enough
to name my boat the ahi.
i saved a cat from a tree once.
[♪ soft music]
i love you.
i'm sorry.
it's ok.
you have nothing
to be sorry for.
in 24 hours, i will be home...
with my parents.
i wish i could come with you.
- it would be fun.
- yeah.
well... my parents could always...
- no.
- ...help out.
it's fine. in two and a half months,
you'll be back.
yeah, i know, i know, i know.
i was just thinking...
as an option.
but it will go so quickly, actually,
that we won't even notice it.
- we won't even notice.
[chuckles] no.
[both laugh]
ooh.
it's so nice.
thank you.
[♪ soft piano music]
[music continues]
[soft groan]
jacob.
i've made a decision.
i'm gonna stay.
i'm gonna stay for the summer.
and i'll just go back for the wedding
and come back after that.
as much as i'd like that,
you can't do that.
- why?
- your visa.
i can't go back.
then we don't have to be sad.
and we have so much fun.
and nothing to do. and we
can stay in bed all summer.
- ok.

and how's business?

it's been good, actually.
very, very lucky, um... we...
[mother] how many more days
has he got here?
[anna] um... not many.
so, what are you going to do?
i mean, is this how it's going to be?
i don't know.
don't ask questions like that.
- i don't know, we'll see.
- it's expensive. you can't just keep
- flying back and forth.
- i know that. we're just making it work
how we can at the moment.
and then we'll see what happens.
we're just taking it each...
day as it comes.
- i've just moved in to a loft space.
but we're very lucky because things
have been going really well.
- good. yeah.
- yeah.
ideally, it'd be
great to work out here.
it's just i am so
set up in los angeles.
[bernard] no, i understand.
[all laughing]
[mother] stop it!
- all right. this is a blended whiskey.
- oh, no, here we go!
and all i want you to do
is just try it. ok?
and then we'll move on
to something much nicer.
- you have to close your eyes.
- you don't have to close your eyes.
- you do have to close your eyes!
- all right, close your eyes.
[bernard] all right.
just a flavor of whiskey
that you know. this...
is a single malt, and it's
been in casks for 12 years.
and i know that because it
<i>says</i> so right on the bottle!
- oh! that's so good!
[mother] you can share it.
[bernard] and there is vodka
in it, but not that much.
- although...
- what else do we need?
i'm not a big...
i have to admit to you all...
- you had the tiniest, tiniest sip!
- ...that i'm not a big fan.
[bernard] what, of tomato juice?
[mother] of the bloody mary?
it's such a pity
you have to go back.
yeah, i wish, i wish i could
stay longer. i really do.
well, it would be so much easier if the
whole immigration thing was sorted out.
- i asked you...
[bernard] because i know harry
has been a bit of a slowpoke
handling this stuff,
but once you've annoyed them,
you have to play by the book.
and it takes much more time and,
i tell you, a lot more money.
i realize all you did,
darling, was overstay
- for a couple of months.
[anna] do we have to go over it again?
[bernard] no, we don't, but...
- we've been through it so many times.
[bernard] but why not go
for an easier solution?
- bernard.
- if you two got married,
it'd save me a lot of money.
[mother] bernard!
[bernard] what?
- well, it would be.
[mother] sorry.
i think you've had enough
of the whiskey, all right?
[bernard] i don't
think i've had enough.
[mother] i don't want
to embarrass them.
"tantony." it's the
runty pig of the litter.
[all laughing]
[mother] you're so stupid!
- oh, god, i've got to stop it.
[bernard] this is far more disciplined
- than we normally are, i might say.
[mother] right.
who's dasher now?
[anna] you, mum.
[mother] oh, no, no. really?
[♪ soft piano music]
i just feel weird.
why do you feel weird?
i just feel kind of...
you feel weird...
i hate it when you
say you feel weird.
why?

i'm actually part of your life.
i feel like i'm on vacation.
i don't know. that's not
how it feels. it just...
i don't know.
it just feels weird...
sometimes.
well, would it be easier
if you felt like...
you could see other people...
when we're not together?
is that what you want to do?
then why would you bring it up?
because...
i don't want you to feel like...
you're not
living your life properly...
when we're not together.
are you attracted to other people?
- no, i'm not attracted to other people.
- why did you have to think about that?
because it's a silly question.
no, it's obviously
not a silly question
if you have to think about it.
i don't mean it like that.
i don't mean...
that i'm attracted to other people.
i just mean it's hard
to keep stopping and starting.

this is samantha.
hi, how are you?
no. no later than three weeks.
ok. all right.
just let me know.
ok, bye.
did they say they could
do it in three weeks?
yeah.
- well, they always do.
- i know.
- oh, hi, anna.
- hey.
you fancy a cup of tea?
yeah. ok.
i actually might stop off
and go to topshop after work.
oh, yes.
- do you want to come with?
- oh, yes, let's, let's.
so i read your thing.
it's good.
so who is this person?
um... it's...
it's someone that is...
is very close to me.
and, um,
he's been quite an
inspiration in my life,
and i almost...
through my writing, i wanted to, um...
give something back.
yeah. when i was reading it,
it made me think about the fact that
when... when i was...
i was working in new york at nylon mag,
and my husband was in los angeles
so he was driving across country.
so on the way over, he would take all
these pictures of himself and the dog
at various places.
so i sent photos of me.
and then we put them all together, and
they were like this moment in time.
being separate, but yet we were
together in these photographs.
well, i was going to say that it's a way
of even kind of keeping you together.
- connecting.
- yeah.
now, there's the challenge.
yeah, it's hard.
it made me miss him more.
so, um...
you know we have this blog.
i would like you
to take over the blog
and start writing for the magazine.
wow, uh... that's great.
- yeah, that would be...
- we need a really nice young voice,
and i think that you are that.
- i don't feel very young.
- well, you are.
no, i would...
it would be a privilege.
good.
- yellow, red, maybe an orange.
[telephone rings]
some different shades of orange.
whatever kind of orange you think.
hey, anna, could you get the phone?
jacob helm. this is samantha.
if i tried...
if i tried orange...
- thank you.
- ...it doesn't have to stay on.
as long as they don't
put a veneer on it.
if she likes that and
you like that, great.
are you mad at me
for some reason?
what? no.
you sure?
yes. why would i be mad?
what happened earlier today
didn't upset you?
it was a mistake.
i'm sorry.
[whispers] it's all right.
[kisses] [laughs]
- are we gonna go out tonight?
- yes. do you want to?
- yeah.
- good.
[♪ figurine: "impossible"]
[people chattering]
[people cheering]
[music continues]
hey, i'm gonna go
to the bathroom, ok?
- anna, i...
- i just have to say one thing,
and it's really important
that you just listen to me.
i just... it doesn't feel like
this thing is going to go away.
it's always there. i can't...
- i can't get on with my life.
- we agreed.
i know, jacob, but the things
that we have with each other,
i don't have with any other person.
with any other human being
apart from you.
we should be with each other.
and i feel it so strongly.
and i feel like... it's right
for us to get married...
<i>that's our only option now.
i don't want to have regrets about us.</i>
<i>and we can make this work
if we do that.</i>
i spoke to harry, and he said
it'll only take six months,
and then i can come back.
and then we can be together.
so will you just
think about it for us?
<i>just come for a few days,</i>
<i>and then we can make this work.</i>
[♪ soft piano music]
i know you talked to her.
[whispers] yeah.
[whispers] yeah.
come here.
sam...
you're such a nice,
giving, caring human being.
and...
it's not fair for you to have to...
experience things...
and be with someone
that isn't fully there for you.
and i'm sorry,
because i have to go to london.
i'm so sorry, sam.
i love you.
[whispers] ok.
i'm sorry, sam.
yeah.
[sniffles]
<i>[man] i do solemnly declare...
[jacob] i do solemnly declare...</i>
<i>[man] ...that i know not
of any lawful impediment...</i>
<i>[jacob] ...that i know not
of any lawful impediment...</i>
<i>[man]

why i, jacob matthew helm...

to anna maria gardner.
- ...to anna maria gardner.
[man] they now wish
to affirm publicly
their relationship
and to offer each other
the security that
comes from vows sincerely made.
jacob, place the ring on anna's finger.
- i give you this ring...
[jacob] i give you this ring...
[man] ...as a token of my love
and affection.
[anna] as a token
of my love and affection.
[both giggling]
[man] and, remembering this day,
never allow anything...
and, remembering this day,
never allow anything...
[man] ...to destroy the feeling
that we share for each other.
to destroy the feeling
that we share for each other.
wear it with a feeling
of love and joy...
always.
[man] you have made a solemn
and binding contract with each other
here in the presence
of your witnesses this morning.
it gives me great pleasure to tell you
that you are now husband and wife.
[applause] [bernard] yay!
[man] you'll need the witnesses.
[man, indistinct]
- be careful.
[all laugh]
[anna laughs]
i'£'s huge!
[both laughing]
i should have grabbed glasses.
- i'm an idiot.
- no!
- should we just drink it that way?
- hm-hm.
that's very classy.
[laughs]

[♪ electronic music]
[♪ fool's gold: "surprise hotel"]

[anna] i hate six months.
it's all gonna be ok.
six months.
[♪ soft piano music continues]
[man over p.a., indistinct]
oh, you're killing me.
all right.
[♪ soft piano music]
[♪ soft music continues]
[kissing sounds]
[woman] all right.
jacob and... is it anna?
- anna.
[woman] anna.
i see a lot of good
documentation here,
and i have looked
through some of it.
sorry, i forgot to... they're...
[woman] books?
- ...just books and a record
of our relationship
since we first met,
- that, um... that i produced each year.
<i>- </i> uh-huh.
let's see.
what are these tickets from?
we both really like paul simon.
and one of our first dates,
when we'd met,
we went to see him in concert.
- when was that, jacob?
[jacob] uh, two months after we met.
- mm-hm. how was the concert?
[jacob] it was great.
[woman] yeah.
- he's great live.
[laughs] yeah.
- and here's your marriage certificate.
i know you got
married here in london
- just a few months ago, yes?
[anna] yes.
well, i want to tell you
that i don't doubt the authenticity
of your relationship. however, what is
at issue... i see here...
four, is it, appeals.
these are the official documents dealing
with the violation of the student visa.
and this imposed a ban.
and that, unfortunately is the...
comes down to the reason
that i can't process your application
for marriage visa, nor lift the ban.
it has to come from
the student visa office.
yeah, but we've already applied several
times throughout the last couple years,
as you can see. so i don't know how
many times you expect us to do it.
i mean, i don't know how...
we were told...
i was told by my lawyer
that this would be dealt
with separately
from the visa violation,
which is why we're here.
- we've appealed four times.
[woman] he was misinformed.
- that is what is in the way.
- this is a separate situation.
then i want to know who he spoke to,
because we speak to someone different
- every single time.
[anna] should there not be one person
who's dealing
with our particular application?
[woman] i wish i could
process this right now,
but it is not up to me,
and i will handle it as soon
as i get a lift on the ban.
i'm sorry.
[people chattering]
[live band playing]
[chattering continues]
[anna] where did you go?
- where did you go?
- why did you just walk off?
i didn't. i went to look at something,
and then i turned around
and you were gone.
- you should have just said.
- whatever. what do you want to do?
- i don't know. i'm really tired.
- yeah, so am i.
so do you want to go or what?
or do you want
to get something to eat?
sure.
- i'm not really that hungry any more.
- well, we don't have to.
do you want to eat?
what does that mean?
do you want to eat?
[car alarm blares]
[children shouting]
so is it worth talking about
you moving to london...
again?
[jacob] maybe.
i mean...
you could design furniture here.
yeah. absolutely.
uh...
it would be difficult, but yeah.
- who are you texting?
[jacob] just work.
an order.
[toilet flushes]
[anna] so you're very close
to your work colleagues.
well... what does that mean?
[anna] why didn't you tell me
that there was still something
between you and her?
- why are you reading my phone?
- i didn't go through your phone.
i walked over there
and your messages are out.
- it's not that hard to...
- my messages were out?
yeah. i could see them. it's not...
you don't have to be einstein.
just tell me what's happening
with you and her.
- there is nothing happening.
- why didn't you just tell me, jacob?
i told you.
there's nothing happening.
you're obviously involved in
something with this person.
i am not involved in anything.
you're not involved in anything
with this person?
there's nothing
between you whatsoever?
- absolutely not.
- that's a lie.
please don't go through my phone.
it's just going to make you paranoid.
why didn't you tell me
that it was still...
there was still, like,
a thing between you and her?
- there is no thing between me and her!
- there obviously is a thing
- between you and her. there is!
- no, there is no thing!
- i just read your text message!
- she works with me!
- you shouldn't read my messages!
- don't shout. don't shout.
- you shouldn't read my text messages.
- why did you just shout at me?
- i'm sorry that i shouted.
- don't raise your voice at me.
people are gonna come around
if you keep shouting.
oh, my god.
it's really important
if people come around.
who's gonna come around? simon?
did you sleep with him?
- did you? tell me.
- don't touch me.
- jacob, don't touch me!
- did you sleep with him, yes or no?!
- did you?
- jacob, don't.
"jacob, don't" what?! did you,
yes or no? it's very simple.
very simple question,
very simple answer, yes or no. did you?
i'm not answering your questions.
why can't you look at me and tell me?
- look at me and tell me!
- don't shout!
- i'll shout if i want to shout.
- no, you won't shout in my house.
all right then!
i'll go back to my house!
- yeah.
- i'd love to go back to my house!
- i'd go right now if i could!
- why are you shouting at me?!
i don't understand why
you can say things like that!
- don't shout!
- yes, i'd rather fucking be there!

- uh-huh.
thank you very much.

[jacob] who said i was
terrified of heights?
- it was just that one time. one time.
- i've seen you on a ferris wheel.
that ferris wheel was shaking
in a way that ferris
wheels aren't supposed to shake.
[anna] did you want to see me?
- yes.
i wanted to know how my new
junior editor was doing.
[laughing]

commend you two on producing
such a wonderful young woman?
