- that's the third false alarm this week.
allright show's over...
break it up, break it up!
- oh i see someone else who has a bun in the oven?
- i'm not pregnant!
too bad, you'd make
a wonderful mother.
manny i know your excited, i am too,
but your getting a little carried away.
okay, okay, boy, your
starting to sound like diego.
wait a second... where is diego?
my hooves are burning, baby!
they are burning!
oh, look at this, i got to tip-toe!
i got to tip-toe! eat my dust, dingo!
- huh, can i look now?
- easy, don't freak out the baby.

out daddy i'm worried about.
ah-uh-uh, no peeking.
<i>- voila! playground for junior...
- ohh wow!</i>
it's amazing.
- ohh manny...
- i made it myself, our family.
hey why aren't i up there?
- you can be on ours.
- you'd fit right in.
of course it's still work in progress.
few rough edges, here and there.
- i don't believe it, your trying to baby proof nature.
- baby proof nature? get outta here.
that's ridiculous.
manny, this is the world our baby's
gonna grow up in. you can't change that.
of course i can, i'm the
biggest thing on earth.
okay big daddy, i can't wait to see,
how you handle the teen years.
come on, sid. i don't want you
touching anything. this place is for kids.
are you a kid?
don't answer that.
diego, there you are.
you missed the big surprise.
- i'll check it out later.
- okay, see ya.
- you know, i think there's something bothering, diego.
- no, i'm sure everything's fine.
- you should talk to him.
- guys don't talk to guys, about guy problems.
- we just punch each other on the shoulders.
- that's stupid!
to a girl, but for a guy, that's
like six months of therapy.
okay, okay i'm going.
- hey.
- oww!
- why'd you do that?
- i don't know.
so listen, ellie thinks theres
something bothering you...
actually, i've been thinking, that soon,
it might be time for me to head out.
okay, so i'll just tell her that
your fine. it was nothing.
look, who are we kidding, manny? i'm losing my edge.
i'm not really built for chaperoning play-dates.
what do you talking about?
having a family, that's huge.
and i'm happy for you, but...
- it's your adventure, not mine.
- so you don't want to be around my kid?
no, no, no, t-thats...
your taking this the wrong way.
no go, go find some adventure.
mr. adventure guy!
don't let my boring domestic life
hit you on the bottom, on your way out.
isn't ellie supposed to be the
one with the hormonal imbalance?
manny, wait! no one has to leave.
- so?
- that's why guys don't talk to guys.
- why what happened.
- diego's leaving.
whoa, whoa, this should be the best
time of our lives. we're having a baby.
- no, sid. they're havin' a baby
- yeah but, we're a herd. we're a family
look things have changed.
manny has other priority's now.
face  it, sid. we had a great run,
but... now it's time to move on.
- so it's just the two of us.
- no, sid. it's not the two of us.
crash and eddie, are coming with us?
just, crash?
just, eddie?
goodbye, sid.
okay, calm down. calm down.
i'm good at making friends.
i'll make my own herd.
that's what i'll do!
<i>hey! "me amigo's. que pasa?"</i>
well, at least you still got your looks.
ohh great!!
anybody here?
hello?
oh poor guys, i know what
it's like to feel abandoned
don't worry,
you're not alone anymore.
there you go.
stay here! you take care of your brother
now, momma's coming right back.
momma's coming, baby!
i got you.
what did i just tell you kids?
ohh, thank you, thank you,
thank you!
bad eggs, rotten eggs. a heart
attack you almost gave me.
ohh i'm sorry darling, it's
just that i love you so much.
hello!
i'd like to present, eggbert,
shelly and yoko.
sid, whatever you're doing.
it's a bad idea!
- shh! my kids will hear you.
- they're not your kids, sid. take them back.
- you're not meant to be a parent.
- why not?
first sign: stealing
someone else's eggs.
second sign: one of them
almost became an omelet.
- sid, someone must be worried sick looking for them.
- no, they were underground, in ice.
if it wasn't for me they'd be...
egg sickles.
sid, i know what your going through.
you're gonna have a family too someday.
you gonna meet a nice girl, with... with low
standards, no real options, or sense of smell...
- what manny means to say is...
- no, i get it. i'll take them back.
you have your family and i'm
better off alone. by myself.
a fortress of solitude.
in the ice, for ever!
alone, lonely loner..
- that's a lot of aloners.
- precisely!
- sid, wait.
- no, no, it's ok.
he'll bounce back, it's one of
the advantages of being sid.
why should i take you back.
i love kids.
i'm responsible, loving, nurturing.
what do you think?
i knew you would agree.
oh oh, don't cry!
i'll find a dry place.
let me just dry you off.
i don't know, being
a parents, a lot of work.
maybe i'm not ready.
mamma, mama, mama!
i'm a mommy.
where's mommy?
here i am!
there you go, nice clean faces.
i got it! i got it!
stop it, no.
hey, no biting!
i'm sorry, no, it's okay, it's okay.
don't cry! why you still crying?
are you hungry? maybe your hungry.
i know just the thing.
<i>...this is animal</ i>
i am your baby and this is my milk </ i></i>
ahhhh!!!
i thought you were a female!
i'm sorry, but you can't go in.
manny says, it's just for kids.

- the sloth says the playground's open!
- no, wait. not for everyone!!
no, no. don't touch that!
- what are they?
- who cares? their fun!
- mommy, his not sharing.
- aren't you gonna do something. - why my kid had it first.
- did not!

- what is the matter with you?
- i'm a single mother with 3 kids.
i could use a little compassion.
- no don't!
- no, don't! stop.
- ronald!
- whoa! that's insane.
stop! stop! stop!
- hold on,  little johnny!
- i'm trying!

let the kids eat whatever they want.
- do you think my ankles look fat?
- ankles. what ankles?

oh no!!
okay come on spit him out!
if you don't spit out, little johnny,

- little johnny!
oh wait... no! no!
oh i'm really sorry.

the important thing is that no
one got hurt. except for that guy.
and, and those three... and her.
i told you to take them back, and
you kept them! now look what they've done.
- okay granted, we do have some discipline issues.
- eating kids is not a discipline issue.
- but he spit them out!
- well that's super, lets give him a gold star!
they don't belong here, sid. whatever they are
wherever you found them, take them back.
manny, i'm not getting rid of my kids!

- i thought those guys were extinct.
- well then, that is one *angry* fossil. sid!

no, no, no, don't cry.
we are poor little lambs
who have lost our way.
baah, baaah!

hmm. how about, "aaah! the
baby's coming!" how's that?
nah, too long. we need something
short and punchy, like, uh... "peaches"!
- peaches?
- i love peaches, they're sweet and round and fuzzy.
- just like you.
- you think i'm round?
uhh... round is good.
round is, foxy!

- not without, sid.
ellie wait, maybe the
deranged hermit has a point.
- manny! we came this far, we're gonna find him.
- i got tracks.
let's go.
if you go in there, you'll find
your friend... in the after-life!
how do you know? oh
great and wisely, weasely one.
mummy dinosaur carrying three babies,
and some floppy green thing?
- yeah, we're friends with the floppy green thing.
- you got all that from the tracks?
no, not really. i saw 'em come through here earlier.
she's headed for lava falls.
that's where they care, for the newborns.
to get there! you got to go
through the jungle of misery.
across the chasm of death.
- to the plates of wow.
- wow!!!
okay! good luck with the slow decadence
to madness, we're gonna go now.
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! whoa!
what, you-you think this is some sort of tropical getaway?
you can't protect your mate! mate!.
what are you gonna do
with those-those flimsy tusks..?
when you run into the beast?
i call him "rudy".
oh good. good. i was worried it was
something intimidating, like, sheldon or tim.
wait! you mean there's something
*bigger* than mommy dinosaur..?
aye!
- aye?
- aye! aye!
- he's the one that gave me *this*
- whoa. he gave you that patch?
- for free? that's so cool.
- yeah, maybe he'll give *us* one, too!
welcome to my world.
- abandon all hope, he who enters there!
- alright we get it.
doom and despair.
yadda, yadda, yadda.
sounds like a jungle of misery to me.
- hold on.
- why, what's wrong? peaches?
- no, it's just i got a funny feeling.
- you're hungry. low blood sugar!
- there's some fruit. - no, manny!
- i wouldn't do that, if i were you.
- this isn't exactly your playground.
- like i'm going to be afraid of a pretty flower.
- bet you didn't see that coming?
- manny?
for the record, i blame you for this.
stop eating our friends, plant!
- that's it, i'm tearing it up, from the roots.
- do that and it'll clamp-shut forever.
alright, preggers.
don't get your trunk in a knot.
- i'll have them out of there before they're digested.
- digested?
they'll be nothing
but bones in 3 minutes.
- well maybe 5 for the fat one!
- i'm not fat!
- i feel tingly.
- don't say that, when your pressed up against me.
- not that kind of tingly.
- i can feel it too.
- help, someone help us!
- hurry!
it's time to get... buck wild.
who's fat now?
no!
- tourists.
- puked on by a plant. awesome!
- say something.
- thank's for saving us.
- will you help us find the floppy green thing?
- that's not necessary. - yes it is.
alright i'll help ya. but i got
rules. rule number one:
always listen to buck.
rule number two:
stay in the middle of the trail.
rule number three:
he who has gas, travels
at the back of the pack.
- come on then, chop, chop!
- we should all have our heads examined.
that's rule number four.
now, let's go find your friend.
oh it's okay, it's okay. don't
worry, we're gonna be fine.
please swing a little more to...?
see, she's putting us down...
no! i'm too young to be eaten.
wow! nice mucus. and i
don't care for, everyone.
listen these things get complicated.
maybe we can work something out.
i can have them on sundays to tuesdays?
wednesdays to fridays? weekends!
it's okay, mommas okay!
if you eat me, it will send a bad message.
ha! score one for the sloth!
and the scores all tied up.
- do you think the beast will find, sid?
- or more importantly, us?
rudy? are you joking? he's relentless.
he knows all, sees all eats all.
so that's a, yes.
hey, get off my lawn! go on shoo!!
i knew that guy when he was a caterpillar.
you know, before he came out.
so your just living down here by your wits!
all on your own, no responsibilities?
not one! it's incredible. no dependence,
no limits, the greatest life a single guy can have.
did you hear that?
this is my kind of place.
hello? no... no i can't really talk right now...
i'm trying to recover a dead sloth.
now, they're following me!
i know! they think i'm crazy.
o-okay... we're going into the chasm of death,
i'm gonna lose you. i love you too.
- alright, goodbye. goodbye, bye.
- okay, follow me!
that's you in three weeks.
- so, why do they call it the chasm of death?
- well we tried, 'big smelly crack',
- but... uhh, that just made everybody giggle.
- well now what?
- madam...
- she is not doing that.
rule number one.
come on, mammoth.
you supposed to have a good memory.
always listen to buck.
now! eyes forward.
back straight... and uh, yes,
- breathe in the toxic fumes and you'll probably die.
- toxic fumes.
- just another day in paradise.
- wait!
geronimo!
- ellie! you okay? - you have to try this.
- alright now pile on everyone, couldn't be easier.
don't panic! just some, technical
difficulties. keep holding it in boys.
- i can't take it anymore.
- he breathe it. and now i'm breathing it.
- hey we're not dead.
- you sound ridiculous.
me? you should hear you.
alright, alright.
and one, and two...
<i> - christmas, christmas time is here...</ i>
- are you crazy?</i>
it's not poison.
it's so disturbing.
- stop laughing, all of you!
- "stop laughing, all of you!"
what's rule number one?
- they're just laughing, what's so bad about that?
- they died laughing.
- stop laughing!
- do you know what's funny though?
we're trying to save sid
and now we're all gonna die!
- and i don't even like sid.
- who does? he's an idiot!
thank's for getting me into this mess.
it's the most fun i've had in years.
thank you, for deserting the herd.
that was totally super.
stop that! don't you see?
we're all gonna die.
we gotta do everything, huh?
- sometimes i wet my bed.
- that's alright. sometimes i wet your bed.
- i'm not sure how much of that you could hear?
- oh i heard all of it.
- you wet my bed?
- that was, gas talk dude!.
- well, we better get moving.
- aren't we forgetting something?
i'm so lonely.
okay. here you go guys...
muncher, muncher.
what! your not gonna eat your vegetables?
how you going to become big and strong, dinosaurs?
no... i raised them vegetarian.
it's a healthier lifestyle i mean look at me.
excuse me. i'm trying to
have a conversation here.
no, no, no! that's not for us kids.
way to feathery and fleshy and.
...and alive!
no, no, no, we do not
eat live animals, period.
now go, fly. be free.
little, flightless bird.
- my bad.
- hey, where you going?
this is how you resolve a conflict?
no wonder your single.
oh come on. am i talking to myself here?
i say they're vegetarian, you say, 'grrrr' .
i say can we talk about this? you say,
grrrr. i don't call that communication.
see, that's your answer to everything.
what are you afraid of?
you're the biggest thing on, earth.
aren't you?
- they'll never survive, it's dangerous by day!
- but it's even worse at night.
- plus the guide is a lunatic! what
you mean, buck? oh his whack-o.
i am not. totally bonkers! and his
feet smell. shut up! you shut up!
oh you little...
- he's strangling his own foot.
- shouldn't we get moving?
- and give, rudy a midnight snack? not likely.
- the skulls right, take a load of mammals.
we'll camp here. now, who's hungry?
i am. you don't need the calories!
there i was... my back
against the wall. no way out.
perched on a razor's edge of oblivion.
staring into the eye, of the great white beast.
- were you killed?
- sadly, yes. but i lived!
never had i felt so alive, than
when i was so close... to death.
just before, rudy could
suck me down his gullet.
i grabbed hold of that, roast pink fleshy thing
that dangles at the back of the throat.
i hung on to that sucker,
and i swung back and forth, back and forth.
back... and forth and back. until finally
i let go and shot right out of his mouth.
i may have lost an eye that day.
but i got this.
rudy's tooth...
it's like the old saying: "an eye for
a tooth". a nose for a chin. a butt for a"...
- it's an old saying. but uh, it's not a very good one.
- you are super weasel.
- ultra weasel.
- diesel weasel.
what? he is.
now let me tell you about the time i used
to sharpen, clam-shell to turn a t-rex,
- into a t-rachel
- yes master.
wow, that's enough
fairy-tales for one night.
- come on, ellie. you should rest now...
- pff..life at the party.
- alright, you guys get some shut-eye, i'll keep watch.
- don't worry, buck, we got this.
- night time is possum time.
- yeah, we own the night baby.
good night, rudy.
wait, wait. what about me?
sleep well, kids. we have a busy
day tomorrow. forging, hunting...
missing my friends.
probably are not missing me.
what..?
your a real softie.
you know that?
manny?
crash? eddie?
manny?
what's going on? are you okay?
i'm sorry. i just wanted
to keep you safe, and
now you're in the most
dangerous place in the world.
this isn't your fault. it's bigger than
both of us. we have to get, sid.
yeah, but if i had been a better friend
to him... we wouldn't be here.
better friend?
are you plucking my whiskers?
you risked your life, your mate
and your baby to save your buddy!
not the best husband or father,
but... a damn good friend.
everybody stop!
i smell something.
hmm, it smells like
a buzzard's butt fell off.
- and then got sprayed on by a bunch of, skunks.
- that's, sid.
mammal's, we have ourselves a crime scene.
half eaten carcass! hunk of...oh, no!
broccoli!
here's what i think happened: dinosaur attacked sid,
sid, fights back with piece of broccoli.
- leaving dinosaur, a vegetable.
- are you nuts?
sid's not violent,
or co-ordinated.
- yeah and where's the dinosaur?
- alright, alright. good point.
theory two:
sid's eating broccoli. dinosaur eats sid.
dinosaur steps on broccoli.
- leaving broccoli, a vegetable.
- buck, when exactly did you lose your mind?
umm... 3 months ago. i woke up
one morning married to a pineapple.
an *ugly* pineapple.
- but i loved her.
- uh, buck! i think you missed a little clue over here.
your friend might be alive.
but not for long. rudy's closing in.
wow...
you got it. the plates of, wow.
or whatever's left of them.
single file everyone.
head for, lava falls.
- what's that sound?
- it's the wind. it's speaking to us.
