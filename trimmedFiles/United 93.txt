somewhere over the city.

we're getting reports
this morning, that a plane
has crashed into one of the towers
of the world trade center.
cnn center right now is just beginning
to work on this story.
obviously calling our sources and
trying to figure out exactly what happened.
but clearly something relatively devastating
happening this morning there
in the south end of
the island... i don't know.
i'll tell you what, that
is not a small plane. no way.
it's huge.
a cessna would have bounced off that.
look at the size of that hole!
look at all them people sitting...
i got a bad feeling about this.
i'll tell you right now.
is that american 11? is that
who they were tracking?
nobody's telling us
anything. no info. i have no info.
well, which way are we
looking here? if we're looking...
it looks like the sun's on that side of
the building, so we're looking north.
he came from our left. he
had to come from the west.
that aircraft came in from
the west into that building.
who could it be?
now where's american 11?
you know what i want you to do?
get in touch with the nypd.
see if they have any information on
what caused that in the trade center.
look at the size of that explosion.
sean, you're on the air right now.
what can you tell us about...
and, folks, captain dahl.
we've reached our
cruising altitude of 35,000 feet
and i'm going ahead and turn the
"fasten seat belts" sign off.
that is your signal you are
safe to move about the cabin.
we got the seatbelt sign off.
however, when you are in your seats
i'll ask you to keep your
seatbelts loosely fastened,
as you never know when we'll
get some bumps we're not expecting.
our flying time today again
is 5 hours and 25 minutes,
and in spite of that
short delay back there in newark
i'm still projecting an
on-time arrival in san francisco.
i'll update you on the weather
as we get a little closer.
in the interim now, i'll ask
you to sit back and enjoy
the outstanding service of
our fine flight attendants.
if there's anything we in the cockpit can
do to make your ride more enjoyable,
please don't hesitate to ask.
thank you.

tell me anything.
they didn't tell you anything at all?
it was just the maintenance department.
i got through to united. i got
through on the maintenance line.
i told them that the plane was
hijacked. i mean, i don't know what else to say.
i don't know what to do.
he didn't tell us anything!
he's a maintenance guy!
no, no, no! you back!
you back! you back!
okay. sit! you!
ziad!

roger. we heard that also. just wanted
to confirm it wasn't from interference.
victor, 956. victor, 956, go.
i wanted to answer your call.
we did hear that yelling, too.
copy that.
i think we're turning.
wait. we're turning. are we turning?
that means it's all right. it's okay...
we're gonna go back to the airport.
they're going to ask for ransom. what?
i hope so.
in 1977 in mogadishu, they
asked, you know, for money.
they will ask for ransom.
they will let us go.
we're going back to the
airport, all right?
we're going back to the airport.
they're trained to deal
with this situation. okay?
and they'll get us down on
the ground, all right? okay?
i'm a pilot. i've been flying all
my life. but it's... i just...
what? something's wrong here.
we're okay.
anybody know where 77 is?
cleveland center was the
last one to talk to united 93.
cleveland center is the
last one who spoke to united 93.
but what about the military
response on this?
i'm talking to them now. i'm
letting them know where we are with this.
listen, you got to get somebody...
where are they when we need them?
...down the hallway to talk to them.
they are supposed to be
liaisoning with the military.
and i've got this colonel here,
he's not giving me the answers i need.
we're giving you the best we can,
sir. the best information i've got.
we're trying to get this
cap established over new york.
i don't give a shit about the cap!
listen to me. i've got
a board full of planes.
american 77's missing!
united 93 another suspected hijack.
where are those fighter
jets? are they...
you've got to get them into position
to do something about these aircraft.
we've got selfridge on
the command post right now.
they've got two jets that can
fly from alpena right now.
get them on frequency. hand
them off to that. copy that.
what do you got, foxy? what do you got?
we got two f-16s out of selfridge,
chevy flight, airborne,
coming to our freq now.
they're unarmed, but
that's all we've got. copy that.
we're gonna need more support
and i've got to know, sir.
when they get there, what can they do?
...for a real world military mission.
i understand it's a commercial
airliner, sir.
there will be casualties. but what...
think about what happens
if they hit the ground.
think of what... if they
hit the capitol, sir.
go ahead, mcc. go ahead, go ahead.
we got two f-16s coming out of
selfridge, but they're unarmed.
but how many more are out
there? that's the question.
we've got a report of at least
one more. may we engage?
i think we shouldn't provoke them.
just do what they want.
and then they'll land and let
us go and let the authorities...
shouldn't somebody try to talk to them?
the police, they'll take care of them.
give them what they want.
maybe we can negotiate with them.
quiet.
just listen to me, sweetie, i want
you to call the authorities...
i'm calling from the airfone.
you believe me, don't you, mom?
did he stab him?
we got to go up there.
just take us back to the airport...
it's all right. it's just us.
let us see the passenger.
just the passenger.
richard, it's jeremy.
i'm on the plane. let me talk to lyzzie.
okay... you.
there's the passenger he stabbed.
okay. okay.
okay. we're just checking the passenger.
did you contact the pilot?
no, nobody said anything. we can't
get through to the cockpit.
we can't get through.
okay, okay, okay.
sir, okay. okay, sir.
we're united flight 93. we've been hijacked.
there's three men with knives.
one of them has a bomb
strapped around his waist.

oh, my god. come on. come on. come on.
oh, my god.
oh, my god. oh, my god. oh, my god.
stewardess, what's happening
up there? what is happening?
this is awful. listen...
what is happening?
just... we're going back to the airport.
everything's gonna be fine.
call the pilot. listen...
i don't know.
we're just finding out
what we can find out.
get back here. get back here.
listen, listen, listen.
listen! the pilots are on the ground.
that was the pilots. they're
on the ground outside the cockpit.
they're on the floor.
she saw the pilot what?
what? what did she say?
the stewardess just said the pilots
aren't flying the plane.
she saw two bodies in front
of the cockpit on the floor.
they said they saw the pilot
and the co-pilot on the floor.
oh, jesus.
flight united 93, call in.
mcc? cleveland is saying that delta
they're considering delta 1989 a hijack.
we got delta 1989,
suspected hijack, heading west.
hit me up every track.
did you copy that, sir?
two planes? yes.
this is a second plane, sir, coming in.
we got the one going west out of
boston, and american 11 coming into washington.
we still got the selfridge planes, sir.
yes, sir. these guys are not armed.
these fighters are not
armed, and we could ram...
if we ram them and eject, sir. do
we have the authority, though?
just spoke to cleveland, they said
that us air 2619 was headed towards chicago.
they've just evacuated the sears tower.
jesus christ!
united 93 is now reported as nordo.
no transponder, and now
heading eastbound, over cleveland.
let me know what the hell is going on.
six miles southwest of the white house,
boston center's tracking
a primary moving fast.
call dulles tower.
give me this again. give me this again.
can you get me some
verification on that?
sir, we have a vfr aircraft
southwest of washington,
headed straight in now.
sir, i got another flight
coming up south.
we have a plane headed
toward the capitol.
i got an unidentified plane...
yes. i need to know about
the roe. can we engage?
i want you to give me a
right now, you hit me up
every track on every aircraft.
do we have any communication
with the president at all?
where are the fighters?
how long can that take?
air force one's taken off.
they don't know anything about
it. they don't know where he's going.
ben, they're evacuating the white house!
all right, thanks, carol.
they're evacuating it right now.
hey, are we gonna get an
intercept on this, though?
okay. good!
go get yourself out of
your chair and go down...
there's no coordination between
what norad has and what we have.
you know where they're headed.
just get the fighters up there!
how about the vice president, sir? do we
have a location on the vice president?
well, then the vice president
can make the call.
the vice president can make
the call. we can engage.
holy shit.
yes, sir. yes, sir. what's the
eta on those langley birds?
foxy!
spiders are airborne at 0930,
but they brought them out on an
eastbound heading rather than our northbound.
we're gonna get them turned
as soon as possible.
what the fuck? they're what?
they're heading east?
what the hell is wrong out
there? why are those planes off-course?
it looks like they came out on a standard
scramble heading instead of the one i gave.
we're trying to get clearance
to turn them now.
how the fuck did they get out there?
i don't know, sir.
what the fuck are they doing
out over the water?
i don't care, god damn it, if they
break windows, you turn them back over land!
roll quad sevens. turn them
towards washington now.
keep looking for him.
keep looking for him.
it was a plane that crashed
at the pentagon.
and the pentagon is being evacuated.
there is a large fire there,
and that is the smoke you see
in the shot that you are looking at now.
whether that fire is in
the building itself or outside,
we have not yet confirmed.
there is a fire on the
mall in washington.
the cause of the fire in the mall
in washington, we cannot yet tell you.
oh, my gosh!
foxy! sir.
i want those langley
birds over washington.
...that two planes have
crashed into the world trade center.
surveillance, i want you to
hit up tracks west of cleveland...
get back into position.
...heading towards las vegas. hit up.
light me up every track
you've got. let's go.
let's go, let's go! let's keep
going here! let's keep working!
id, what do you got? all right,
he's off-course, he's deviated,
and we don't know why.
confirmed. yes, sir. yes, sir.
confirmed hijackings.
that's the question.
what are we going to do now?
there's a lot of confusion here
at the pentagon. it appears that
something hit the pentagon on the
outside of the fifth corridor,
on the army corridor.
several army officers i talked
to reported hearing a big explosion.
listen, i'm not taking any more chances.
we got stuff flying around
we have no control over.
and i don't want a board full of these
planes hitting every building on the east coast.
this is a national emergency.
everyone lands, regardless of destination.
that's gonna cost billions.
just do it!
we have hundreds of international
flights coming in.
they're already in the air.
no. no, i don't want any more international
flights crossing the borders.
they'll have to go back
where they came from.
nobody's coming into
the country from now on.
everyone? everyone.
shut off the east coast. shut off
all the internationals from europe.
shut off south america,
shut off the west coast,
nothing over the top, either.
we're gonna call canada on that?
yeah, canada, too.
we're gonna shut down the airspace.
no, i can't exempt anybody.
nobody comes in, and nobody takes off.
land them all. take a moment.
think about this.
we're gonna shut down
the entire country right now?
that's right. listen, we're
at war with someone,
and until we figure out what to
do about it, we're shutting down.
that's it. we're finished.
...can handle the emergency situation.
i don't know.
i don't know what to do.
does anybody know about the pilot yet?
they don't know.
no. they don't know.

center. two planes.

other option we have.
if we're gonna die, we're gonna die.
they're flying us into a
building. we're gonna die.
we should not interfere with them.
