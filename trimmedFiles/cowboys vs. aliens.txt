(panting)
(wincing grunt)
(flies buzzing)
we're riding
towards absolution.

is there a reason
you're not answering
my question?
look here, pa.
he's got iron
on his wrist.
he's been shot.

of the hoosegow.

bounty money.

your lucky day,
stranger.

(dismayed grunt)
(sniffing)
(gun cocks)
palms to heaven,
friend.
easy now.
all right.
turn around,
nice and slow.
i've been shot.
only two kinds
of men get shot,
criminals and victims.
which one are you?
i don't know.
you got a name,
friend?
i don't know
that either.
just what do you know?
english.

the west.

as talkative as you?
there we go.
come on into
the light here, son.
take a pull
of that whiskey,
then lay down here
and make yourself
comfortable.
(grunts)
well, that is a right
odd-looking wound there.
looks almost cauterized.
all right, this
might sting a bit.
(grunts)
is this a mining town?
yeah. well, that
was the notion.
people moved on,
though. no gold.
all right now,
try and hold still.
(winces)
there we go.
this is no gunshot.
where'd you
get this, son?
i don't know.
i can't rightly
absolve you
of your sins
if you don't
recall 'em,
can i?
that being said,
i've seen good men
do bad things
and bad men do
good things.
whether you're gonna
end up in heaven or hell,
it's not god's plan,
it's your own.
you just got to
remember what it was.
all right,
put me a finger
right here.
come on.
there you go.

shoot up the place?
what was that, doc?
nothing.
he didn't say anything.
everything's okay.
please, please,
go back inside.
shut up.
i want to hear
what you said.
"it's bad enough" what?
you ungrateful
for our business?
'cause if it wasn't
for my pa's cattle,
there'd be no money
going through this town !
there'd be no meat
on your tables!
and your doors
would be closed !
i don't mean no disrespect
to your father, percy.
you know that.
of course not.
but you're asking me
to pay.

he tried to make me
look like a fool.
it wasn't my fault,
sheriff.
damn it, percy.
you crossed
the line this time.

(sobbing)
they took my wife.

greavy:

(electricity crackles)

bible stuff? demons?
i'm not talking
about anything.

are you talking about?

you're telling me
to calm down !
(woman screaming)
(man yelling)
(crashing)
(loud growling)
(gun firing)
(people exclaiming)
nat: boss!
boss!
it went this way.
i don't know what it is,
but it's bleeding.
that's the same direction
those machines went
with our kin.
we ain't gonna be able
to track it in the dark.
round up the horses,
get some supplies!
we set off
at first light!
you.
you're going with us.
i need that weapon.
it's the only thing
that counts.
and i figure you owe me.
i don't see it that way.
meacham: recall
the book of numbers,
wherein god
commanded moses into
the promised land of canaan.
but moses was unsure,
so he sent his spies
into that land to survey it.
and they came back
with terrible stories.
stories of evil beings,
monsters the likes
of which they had
never seen before.
"giants," they said.
"and they were
as grasshoppers in
their eyes," they said.
and the people of
israel became afraid.
"how can we survive
against them?"
they lost their faith.
they forgot that
there is nothing to fear
under heaven and earth
as long as we walk
in the path of
righteousness.
man: hold him still.
hold him still !
meacham: that he created
man by blowing his breath
into the mud,
and so there is
in each of us a little
breath of god.
see if you can
stop the bleeding.
use this.
meacham:
"thou shalt not be afraid
of the terrors of the night,
"nor the arrow
that flieth by day,
"nor the pestilence
that walketh in darkness."
god is testing us, friends.
he's testing our faith.
so we're goin'
after our kin.
(grunts)
what do you want?
you come clean
right now,
or i'll kill you.
they took my people, too.
i've been looking
for them a long time.
i know you can
help me find them.
you stay away from me.
i can help you !
you know, some of these
boys think they might
already all be dead, boss.
if they wanted 'em dead,
they'd be dead.
they was ropin' people.
that was a round-up.
where do you think
you're goin'?
i'm comin' with you.
you're dead weight.
they took my wife,
i'm comin'.
besides, i'm a doctor.
you need me.
suit yourself.
meacham:
you stop right there.
i'm sorry, son,
you can't go.
it's too dangerous.
i'll watch him
on the ride.
he can water
the horses.
he ain't got nobody.
all right, then.
make sure your
canteen's full.
it's heading north.
its tracks
are still fresh.
if it's all the same,
i'd like to ride along, too.
yes, ma'am.
got a kid and a dog,
why not a woman?
you're back.
what's that?
you have to
take it back.
like hell i will.
that's blood money.
well, i goddamned
earned it.
by robbing and killing.
that's gonna get
us what we need !
(coins rattling)
(shrieks)
jake!
stay there!
jake!
(screaming)
i don't even know
why we're doing this.
you know they're all dead.
well, i think if they
wanted to kill them,
i think they would have.
only if the boss is right
and they was roping them.
bet it's to eat them.
if it was me,
i'd start with your wife.
(chuckles irritably)
you gonna be like
this the whole trip?
'cause if you are,
we ain't gonna have too many
long conversations, are we?
why don't you sing
a song or something?
cook some beans.
do something useful.
take some friendly advice?
get yourself a gun
and learn how to use it.
well, well, well.
look who's back.
i see you, but
i don't see my gold.
let's say we find
those people first,
and then you can
take your best shot
at collecting.
maybe that reward
on your head
would be a more
attractive proposition.
or i could just shoot you
in the chest and cut
that thing off your arm.
can't we
just be happy the guy
with the big gun's back?
much obliged to you,
mr. lonergan.
yeah, well,
i ain't done
nothin' yet.
i appreciate it,
all the same.
(barking)
nat: the tracks
are washed away.
i don't know
much about boats,
but i'd say that
one's upside-down.
woodrow: we're 500 miles
from any river
big enough to hold it.
well, let's get inside,
get out of the rain !
i'm not going anywhere
near that thing.
suit yourself.
sleep in the rain.
(owl hooting)
(thudding)
how you gentlemen doin'?
all right. how are you?
good.
i'm gonna take first watch.
thank you, deputy.
(grunts) you want
a seat, preacher?
no, no, no.
make yourself
comfortable.
you know, doc,
this here is
a spencer 56-50.
you ever shot
one of these?
no.
no time like
the present.
how's that feel?
it's heavy.
it's a heavy gun, yeah.
i swear to god,
it's raining harder
in here than it is outside.
i'm soaked through.
what in the hell are we
sittin' around here for?
we need to be
five miles and a long trot
headin' in the opposite
direction of those things.
(chuckles) if we tried that,
the old man would
shoot us himself.
ain't that right, wes?
yeah, he would.
you fixin' to
say something?
maybe. . .
maybe we should have
called in the army?
i ain't gonna
turn this over to
no west pointers
who got to get
on the telegraph
to ask washington
which hand to wipe with.
i waited around
at antietam for 'em
to tell me what to do.
and lost 328 men
over a cornfield.
i remember
those stories.
i don't recollect
telling you any stories.
i'd listen when you'd
tell them to percy.
you get this through
your thick indian skull.
them stories
weren't for you.
they were for my son.
get out of here.
go look after the horses.
do your job.
you've been looking
at this knife.
you like this knife?
you look after that.
don't lose it.
all right.
just align your sights,
and when that target
peeks up over the top,
just squeeze the trigger.
(gun fires)
don't yank on it,
it's not your pecker.
now, here.
you're holding onto
this thing like
you're hanging from it.
(yells)
what the hell
am i doing?
it's my fault
she got took.
i never should have
taken her to that town.
no, no, no.
not your fault.
you'll get her back.
you're setting things right.
just got to have faith.
that's all.
faith. yeah.
mmm-hmm.
god's been
real swell to me.
i don't mean no
disrespect, preacher,
but either he ain't up there,
or he don't like me very much.
surely you don't
expect the lord
to do everything for you,
do you, doc?
you got to earn
his presence.
then you got to
recognize it,
and then you have
to act on it.
now, keep your eye
on the target.
and shoot.
that's better. better.
come on. let's reload.
you been there long?
yes.
there something
you need?
who is she?
she's the only one
who knows who i am.
no, you know
who you are.
you just have
to remember.
well, i can't.
yes, you can.
(sighs)
does it hurt?
it's fine.
(beeping)
it's here.
(dog barking)
(rats squeaking)
jesus!
goddamn it!
sit down ! ain't nothin'
but a bunch of damn rats.
damn it!
i ain't getting' paid enough
to chase dolarhyde's idiot son
halfway across the country.
(creaking)
(roaring)
(groans)
(dog continues barking)
easy, hey! easy!
what's wrong, boy?
hello?
(dog whimpering)
(low growling)
(dog whining)
(footsteps approaching)
(relieved sighing)
(growls)

(screeching)

(screams in pain)
(painful gurgle)
the boy. the boy.
he's fine. he's fine.
it's okay.
it's okay.
you got to go get
our people back.
god don't care
who you were, son.
only who you are.
(coughs)
emmett: dog?
come on, boy!
where are you?
come on, boy!
tracks are good.
it's headed north.
i can't find the dog.
we ain't waiting for him.
he's run off or dead.
let's go.
hey. hey. wait.
aren't we gonna say
some words over him?
only one who knows
what to say
is in the ground.
ain't it enough
we took the time
to put him there?
no. no,
it's not enough.
you go ahead.
uh. . .
lord. . .
if there is
such a thing as a soul
this man had a good one.
please protect it.
made me feel better.
world was a better
place for having him.
dust to dust, amen.
how was that?
good words.
what are you all
choked up about?
i'm worried about
my grandpa.
look. when i was only
just a little bit older
than you are now
all this was mexico.
word come that the apaches
was riding towards
a settlement called arivaca.
my father wanted me
to be a man,
so he made me ride
out with the garrison,
banging on a drum.
boy, was i scared.
well, we got there,
it was too late.
they were all dead
and the place
was all burnt down.
this one settler fella
came crawling out
of a burning cabin.
he was bad.
he knew he was gonna die.
burnt bad.
he rolled over,
looked up into my eyes,
and he said,
"kill me."
what did you do?
i took this knife
off his belt
and i slit his throat.
take it.
be a man.
that's a little rough,
isn't it?
he means well.
whoa.
i got him. the tracks
are closer together.
he's slowing down,
headed to that canyon.
put your hands
up in the air!
that means you,
too, pretty lady.
this is what
they call a hold-up.
welcome,
everybody.
welcome.
boss?
boss, is that you?
lonergan?
what the hell
are you doing here?
(speaks spanish)
(awkward chuckle)
who are your amigos?

new gang, jake?
(softly) i never thought
i'd see you again, jake.
you were always
my favorite.
shut up.
(painful breaths)
damn it.
jake? did you

if he so much
as twitches,
blow her brains
out of her ear.
he said the whore.

a whore again,
it'll be the last word
you ever say.
you ain't in no position
to make threats, boyo.
hunt, take his gun.
take his gun !
sorry, jake.
(groans)
where's our gold, jake?
i don't remember.
well, i do remember
you telling us
you was leaving us
high and dry
because of some woman.
i guess you just
left out the part
about taking all our gold
from that last job, huh?
so i'm gonna ask you
one last time.
where is it, jake?
demons.
what's that?
demons took your gold.
when you get to hell
you can ask
for it back.

(beeping)
i told you not
to call her that.
everybody!
drop 'em !
i said drop 'em !
not fun, is it?
you know, that
wasn't very nice.
(grunts in pain)

you'll always
be my favorite.

(screams)
(frightened shrieks)
okay. i got you !
i got you !
can you swim?
oh, god.
turn your head !
you all right?
let's get in.
(panting)
we were flying.
yeah !
i don't want to
do that again.
no.
(groans)
(gasping)
(dress ripping)
(groaning)
hey.
hey, you stay with me.
keep talking.
you remember now,
don't you?
what?
the woman.
did you love her?
you can tell me.
i can't remember.
i must've.
all i know is
i owe it to her
to find her.
(grunts)
watch out.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
i got you.
it's not far now.
you and me,
we're gonna
be just fine.
doc: is that them?
boss?
i got her.
give her to me, nat.
bring her here.
(panting)
here. drink.
no. give it to her.
give it to her.
doc?
how is she?
she's gone, pal.
no. no, she's not gone.
she's not.
she's not gone!
jake.
she's gone.
(whooping)
doc!
don't touch him !
doc!
(speaks in apache)
this is black knife.
the last of his people.
there's no reasoning
with them.
we're all gonna
die anyway.
this is what's left
of the chiricahuas.
good riddance to 'em !
he's saying
the white people,
they brought all this
evil to his people.
we brought evil?
evil was here!
you're the evil one!
he's saying we brought
the monsters.
we didn't bring the monsters.
tell him they took
our people, too!
tell him
they took my wife!
shut up! there's no
reasoning with them !
tell him what
i said, nat!
kill us now!
(fire roaring)
(whooping stops)
i'm sorry, but
i couldn't tell you.
are you one of them?
no. i'm from
a different place.
i took this form so
i could walk among you.
you should
have told me.
i didn't know if
i could heal this body,
if i would wake up.
(speaking in apache)
he wants to know
where you're from.
(speaking in apache)
what'd she say?
she says she came
from a place
above the stars.
what does that mean?
another world?
what do you mean?
what does that mean?
what?
he says
you shouldn't talk.
what do you mean
i shouldn't talk?
i got questions. . .
(speaks sternly)
you're a guest
of the chief.
now i'm a guest?
i thought
i was a prisoner!
enough ! all right.
you're both big men !
great warriors!
can we listen
to the woman
tell her story?
or whatever she is?
what are they doing here?
they want gold.
well, that's
just ridiculous.
what are they gonna do,
buy something?
it's as rare to them
as it is to you.
what about my grandpa?
what about my wife?
what about the other people?
are they still alive?
if they are,
they won't be
for long.
they're studying
your weaknesses.
these are just scouts.
if we let them leave,
they'll come back with more
and there will be
no survivors.
that's what they did
to my people.
i came here to make sure
it would not happen again,
but we have to
work together.
nat: he says his people
will join her.
join her?
what's she going to do?
where you going to go?
we can find them.
he knows where they are.
no, i don't.
i can't remember anything.
i couldn't even
remember my own name.
he says they will
take care of that.
(men chanting in apache)
(drums beating)
(retching)
(coughing)
(grunts)
(chants echoing)
(exhales)
(whimpers)
(gasps)
i brought the gold.
into the house.
that's why she died.
it's not your fault.
(panting)
(screaming)
(screeching)
(panting)
i know where they are.
jesus, mary and joseph.
how did they build
something like that?
they arrived in it.
it's their vessel.
that's only the top.
the rest is underground.
it's how they mine
for gold.
so there is gold here.
can they see
out of there?
they don't see
well in daylight.
they stay underground
in caverns where it's dark.
we'll never
even get close.
those flying machines will
just pick us off before
we get anywhere near it.
there is another way in.
down there.
the way i came out.
we got to get those
creatures out of there
and out in the open,
where we can get at them.
so you can go in
with that arm gun,
get our people out.
we have one advantage,
they underestimate you.
you're like
insects to them.
they're not planning on
defending themselves,
so they'll be vulnerable.
we haven't got
enough men.
this ain't gonna work.
he says he wants
to use your spyglass.
(black knife speaking
in apache)
the apaches are
mountain warriors.
he says it's better to
fight from high ground.
tell him he's a fool.
there is no high ground
while they got
those flying machines.
jake's leaving !
that's just dandy.
the son of a bitch.
quit stalling.
how much gold
we had left?
(speaking spanish)
it's about $1 ,000.
maybe more.
well, i'm just
gonna need to know
how much gold is mine,
so i can best
be on my way.
on your way?
dolan's dead.
i run this gang now.
now, you might be
in charge,
but some of that
gold's mine, fair.
after what
we saw yesterday,
i'm gonna need every
little bit of it i can
to get as far away
from here as i can.
the gold goes
where i go.
(speaking spanish)
what's fair is fair.
red?
i got 'em, bull.
you ain't goin'
anywhere.
(dog barks)
hey, there, dog.
i had one hell of
a job finding you boys.
you planning a trip?
we're going as far
away as we can go.
you remember la playa
in puerto vallarta?
hunt:
they got good fishing.
good tequila. you want
to come with us?
don't make
no difference.
it's not far enough.
what the hell were
those things, jake?
jake: it doesn't matter.
they're gonna find us and
they're gonna wipe us out.
what in the hell
are you saying?
what i'm saying
is you got a choice.
you can drink your last
few hours away on a beach,
which by the way,
is not a bad idea
or you can follow me
one last time.
why the hell
would we do that?
same reason you
always have, bull.
i'll make you rich.
woodrow:
we got to make the best
use of our resources.
we got to have a strict. . .
listen to me, damn it!
he doesn't understand tactics.
you got to explain to him.
look, we can't just
run around hollering
and throwing spears
and shooting arrows
at the damn thing.
we got to draw them
out of there
onto open ground
where we can surround them,
attack them on all sides.
flank them.
explain to him.
he said he's not
going to let you
lead his people.
(nat speaking apache)
what's he saying?
he's saying they need to
open their hearts and see
in you what he has seen.
that his parents died
in the mexican war
and you took him in
when he was only a boy.
that you gave him purpose.
taught him how to
take care of himself
even though you were
not blood.
that you despise battle
but would never run from it.
that you're a fierce warrior
worthy of any fight.
he says if you're such
a great warrior,
why do you only have
a man and a boy to
follow you into battle?
(low rumbling)
dog ! dog !
boy!
how are you?
woodrow.
hot damn.
(chanting)
(whispering) emmett.
(gasps)
you shouldn't be here.
let's go.
(speaking apache)
(chanting)
do you have a woman?
a lady, a wife?
no. i'm always working.
i see.
you work. . .
you work hard?
(chuckles)
yeah.
lot of killing?
huh?
killing?
a little bit.
sí, sí.
yeah.
my wife, you know,
she's a mexicano.
mexicana.
(both speaking spanish)
you should know. . .
i'm not gonna be
here very long.
none of us
are here very long.
don't ever do
that to me again.
give me that. okay.
matches.
i don't have any more matches.
we're gonna have to go down.
i don't know what
we're going to do.
go. go!
(speaks spanish)
go. go!
i think
we destroyed it.
(shouting)
woodrow:
demons are coming out.

where i showed you.
you see our people,
wave your arms.
yes, sir.
move out!
good job.
if your people are in there,
i'll get them out.
godspeed.
let's get them !
(horse whinnying)
(grunts in pain)
this is how they
get the gold out.
bronc: doc!
doc!
(speaking spanish)
what do we got?
i'm hurt. (groans)
you'll be all right.
how bad is it, doc?
just a flesh wound.
you'll be all right.
compadre, you'll be all right.
maybe not point the gun at me.
put some weight
and see how it feels.
get on out there.
they're not going down !

we get our people out!
(urging horse)
(screeching)
(screaming)
(clicks)
doc!

yeah, we got one.
i always dreamed of
riding into battle with you.
i always dreamed of
having a son like you.
go.

get your son.
(whooping)
don't look
into the light.
i told you not to
look into the light.
yeah, right.
how long are they
gonna be like this?
each one's different.
(screeching in the distance)
hold them off.
you'd better hurry.
there's more of
them coming !
(screeching)
ella: go!
everybody's out.

hey! where are
you going?

(screams)
(screaming)
(dog barking)

(shrieks)
(whimpering)
(grunting)
(yells)
(whispering)
what the hell are you doing?
we have to get out of here!
no!
i came here to
destroy that thing.
how?
with the bracelet.
take it off.
wait, i can't
take it off.
yes, you can.
you can control it.
how?
same way you shoot it.
with your mind.
you have to
stop thinking.
this isn't working.
it fell off.
if i can get it
to its core,
i can stop them.
let's go.
take this.

good-bye, jake.

around here.
yes, you could.
jake.

(whines)
