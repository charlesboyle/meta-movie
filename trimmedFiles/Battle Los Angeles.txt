at 1 930 hours,

we're leveling santa monica, sir?
we got an infestation
of god knows what,
not of this earth
and we gotta hit them with everything
and we gotta hit them hard.
they are a ground-force enemy only.
they have no aircraft,
so the air force
will tear them a new asshole
and we will rule the air.
you said ''most civilians,'' sir?
affirmed.
getting distress calls,
sending squads out.
golf, you take santa monica
to olympic.
foxtrot, olympic to pico.

we don't know how many.
just gather survivors,
then you radio in.
we'll have helicopters
in the area to evacuate you out.

three hours before our bombs drop.
and make no mistake, they will drop,
with or without you.

you're gonna marry cherise.

man [over radlo]:
<i>all stations, this net.</i>
<i>sitrep as follow:</i>
<i>enemy aircraft</i>
<i>number four fleets at this time.</i>
<i>be advised,</i>
<i>more entering battle space</i>
<i>los angeles from ocean</i>
<i>on bearing 2-niner-7-5-0.</i>
they got air support too.
knocked our bird
right out of the sky.
so much for ruling the air.
there's no time for that,
lieutenant.
those bombs are gonna drop.
and we're in
the blast radius.
top of my goddamn class.
and l get out in combat
in the middle of that shit?
goddamn it!
l already lost four
of my goddamn men!
four good men.
who would go
to hell and back for you, sir.
have you?
yes.
you're not the first to lose men.
you won't be the last.
now, put that away.
you understand me?
right now your men
are awaiting orders.
now, you can go left,
you can go right.
l don't give a damn.
just make a decision.
mottola:
lieutenant.
lt's a no-go on the helo, sir.
enemy aircraft is lighting it up.
command says it's like nothing
they ever seen.
we gotta find a way out.
we gotta get to that f.o.b.
you're right. we gotta move.
let's get these people safe.
lockett, kerns!
l need you to set up
an observation post on the roof.
<i>we're gonna move by foot,</i>
<i>so we gotta move fast.</i>
<i>scan for hostiles,</i>
<i>find the best route out of here.</i>
kerns:
<i>all right, sir.</i>
lieutenant.
<i>officials are now saying any civilian</i>
<i>within 1 0 miles of the coast</i>
<i>should try to make their way</i>
<i>to a military forward</i>
<i>operating base, or f. o.b.</i>
<i>this is the safest place</i>
<i>that you can be right now.</i>
<i>now, the military has set up</i>
<i>a line of defense to try</i>
<i>to protect civilians.</i>
take a look at you, make sure
you're okay, all right? good. okay.
just look at this.
there you go.
harrls:
water fountain is just there,
mr. rincon.
rlncon:
okay, thank you.
harrls: no problem.
hector: thank you.
uh, joe rincon.
staff sergeant nantz.
this is my son, hector.
we all wanted to thank you
for coming to get us.
yeah.
hey, hector.
we leave no man behind.
so you here
when the police got overrun?
right. well, long as
you're both okay.
hey, you all right, man?
yeah. yeah, l'm good.
okay.
lf you--
lf you need him to do anything,
you know.
l'll let you know.
aye-aye, sir.
aye.
thank you.
kerns:
we got two dozen hostiles
about 300 meters out.
lieutenant, we got
two dozen hostiles
kerns: lt's like
those things are on
overwatch, just like us.
that one out front
looks like the leader.
now they got leadership.
lockett:
so do ants, kerns.
kerns:
you think those things
get scared too?
probably just like us.
they're probably just grunts that
get told to go fight.
come on. just find us
a way out of here, marine,
because we're sitting ducks.
man 1 [on tv]:
<i>they dragged them out of the house,</i>
<i>into the street,</i>
<i>put them in perfect order</i>
<i>before they shot them.</i>
<i>they shot them right in the head.</i>
<i>chief, do we have any idea</i>
<i>why this is happening?</i>
man 2: <i>well, it's clear</i>
<i>there has been no attempt</i>
<i>at any kind of communication.</i>
<i>no demands, nothing like that.</i>
<i>so, obviously,</i>
<i>they are here for our resources.</i>
<i>when you invade a place</i>
<i>for its resources, you wipe out</i>
<i>the indigenous population.</i>
<i>those are the rules</i>
<i>of any colonization.</i>
<i>and, right now,</i>
<i>we are being colonized.</i>
nantz:
brave kids.
they're my nieces.
my sister and her husband
are away on vacation.
thing is, they live in arizona.
l see them once or twice a year.
and now l may be
all they have left.
you have kids?
no.
neither do l.
l used to regret that,
but maybe it was for the best.
man 3:
<i>of course, our planet's surface</i>
<i>is 7 0 percent water.</i>
<i>so again, and l have to stress this,</i>
<i>without certainty,</i>
<i>the leading hypothesis remains</i>
<i>that their objective, their target,</i>
<i>is our water.</i>
shit.
there ain't gonna be nothing left.
l think l got a way out of here.
what'd you say?
right here, look.
what's right behind that backside?
lockett: bus.
lieutenant, we got a bus.
martlnez: roger that.
so the men on the roof
saw a bus. they think
it could be operational.
maybe we'd be
better off on foot.
lt's miles to
the operating base,
and those bombs
are gonna drop in an hour.
we gotta move fast.
bus is a big target.
l made the call.
lt's my responsibility.
nantz:
<i>stavrou, harris.</i>
lieutenant needs recon on a bus.
lf it runs, get it back here.
martlnez:
either of you know
how to hotwire a bus?
stavrou can.
he's from jersey, sir.
ladies first.
[<i>¶¶¶</i>]
lockett:
two hundred meters.
go down, there's the cars burnt out,
there's a pickup truck.
<i>right back behind there.</i>
uh... we have a situation.
y'all need to follow me.
harris found it out here.
y'all gotta see this thing.
[<i>¶¶¶</i>]
martlnez:
weapon looks like it's been
surgically attached.
nantz:
talk about commitment to cause.
[allen cllcklng]
lmlay:
shit.
you gotta be kidding!
corporal. corporal, hold it.
lmlay: let me shoot
this thing, staff sergeant.
that weapon's hot.
let me just shoot it.
nantz: doc.
adukwu: yes, staff sergeant.
oh, lord, have mercy.
nantz: we need to know
exactly where to hit this thing
so we don't waste all our ammo.
maybe l can help.
l'm a veterinarian.
[<i>¶¶¶</i>]
sure you wanna do this?
l was more sure when
l was standing over there.
nantz:
we gotta figure out
how to kill these things.
otherwise, we won't last another
five minutes out there, okay?
let's peel this back.
mlchele:
look at this,
we got a organ right here.
nantz:
jesus christ, look at that.
l got another one.
mlchele: me too.
santos:
does it have some sort of
cognitive mechanism? anything?
adukwu: there's no
frontal lobe, no temporal lobe,
no parietal lobe.
the cranial vault is unlike anything.
oh, shit.
what?
kerns: you see what l'm seeing?
lockett: what?
the ones that were just
on the roof aren't on it.
there's about two dozen
coming out the door.
they're on the street
heading this way.
lieutenant, we got movement up here.
martlnez: <i>roger that.</i>
we have contact 300 meters out.
we gotta cut quick.
lockett:
<i>lieutenant, we gotta move!</i>
<i>what do we do?</i>
shit's hitting the fan. gotta move.
santos: staff sergeant.
nantz:
come on, how do you kill this thing?
[<i>¶¶¶</i>]
[englne struggllng]
goddamn it, stavs.
l lost them.
you lost them?
lieutenant, they're gone.
lieutenant, l don't see anything.
[glass shatterlng]
kerns:
we got a breach.
lockett:
<i>we got a breach</i>
<i>on the north entrance!</i>
they're inside. l'm gonna
gather everyone by the doors
on the south side.
we're right behind you.
[glass shatterlng]
klrsten:

adukwu, you go with her.
adukwu: yes, staff sergeant.
lmlay, got an he grenade round?
never leave home without it.
you cover that hall to the rear.

<i>they start coming,</i>
<i>you blast the hell out of them.</i>

martlnez:

martlnez: <i>lmlay, give me</i>
<i>a sitrep. l need an update</i>
<i>on the breach. report back, over.</i>

[screams]
martlnez:

[allen cllcklng]
lmlay:

they've breached.
nantz:
this is our last shot.

santos:
that's gotta be it. lt's dying.
that's how we kill this thing,
to the right of where
the heart would be.

lmlay: l got three more!
let's get out of here.
martlnez:
get them on the bus! get them
on that bus! let's go, let's go!
rlncon: get on.
mlchele: get underneath.
you okay?
nantz:
heads up. cover your sectors of fire.
heads up!
marines, concentrate firepower to
the right of where the heart would be.
lmlay:
yes, staff sergeant.
nantz:
that's how we kill these things.
all right, remember your training.
we got a hostile warbird,
thousand meters out.
everybody keep your eyes up.
all buckled up
back there, lieutenant.
roger that.
lt should be about
six miles to the f.o.b.
l don't know,
lf we stay
on these side streets.
air force is gonna level
this area in 40 minutes.
get us to the forward operating base.
fast.
[<i>¶¶¶</i>]
[allens cllcklng]
nantz:
what the hell is that?
stavrou, stop the bus.
everyone, get down.
any station, this is
foxtrot-two-november.

man:
<i>go ahead, foxtrot-two-november.</i>
mottola:

downtown los angeles.
man:
<i>copy that.</i>
they're tracking our signals.
mottola, turn off that radio!
they're tracking our signals!
all radios off!

that's retreat, hell!
that's right.
who the hell's john wayne?
harrls:
everybody, eyes open!
martlnez:
stay alert!
thank you for that.
lt's nothing.
what's that mean, ''retreat, hell''?
during world war l,
an officer from our regiment
was ordered to retreat.
he said, ''retreat, hell.
we just got here.''
you should have the doc
take a look at that.
l thought you were a doctor.
animals and aliens only.
l'll put it on my to-do list.
thank you.
excuse me, staff sergeant.
did you say that was
an unmanned drone?
correct.
they must have one hell of
a command-and-control system.
lf northcom
didn't agree with you,
l wouldn't be here.
why?
my mission was
to provide als
with a strike package.
a strike package?
yeah, the coordinates
for a missile strike on a
command-and-control center.
but the asset fell off
the grid and we lost them.
all side streets are blocked.
our only choice is
to take the freeway.
all right.
well, it's your call.
martlnez:
stavrou, get us on a freeway.
we don't wanna be in this area
when these bombs start to fall.
[<i>¶¶¶</i>]
try to miss at least
one of the cars, stavrou.
just keep driving.
off ramp is one mile ahead.
jesus.
martlnez:
look out.
uh, the ramp, it's gone, lieutenant.

now, my son's
an optimist.
when this first happened,
he said, ''you know, why don't
we go try to talk to them?
huh?
maybe they wanna be friends.''
mlchele:
hector? hey.
we're gonna go get some food
and water for your dad, okay?
rlncon:
lt's okay.
and what'd you tell him?
l said:
''you know, if they're chasing
and shooting us,
they're probably not
good friends.''
l should've followed directions
and gone to the f.o.b.
l should've never stayed at the police
station, but l was scared, man.
l made all the wrong decisions.
you trusted your gut,
mr. rincon.
you made a call.
l'd do the same thing
to protect my marines.
l had a situation my last tour.
yeah?
there was no right call. you went left
or you go right, it didn't matter.
but you're alive.
yeah, l survived.
but l wasn't supposed to.
staff sergeant nantz...
you promise to save my son?
santos:
staff sergeant, we have
a hardwired connection!
nantz:
doc, keep him warm.
sun is going down.
this will
keep you warm.
man [on computer]:
<i>we're estimating that 20 cities in 1 7</i>
<i>countries are now under full attack.</i>
<i>lt's obvious the enemy is attempting</i>
<i>to cut us off from one another.</i>
<i>ls there any more information</i>
<i>at this time, professor stavert?</i>
<i>new data shows that they're using</i>
<i>our water as their fuel</i>
<i>and our ocean levels</i>
<i>are already decreasing.</i>
<i>they are using it to power</i>
<i>their ships, their machinery,</i>
<i>possibly even their own bodies.</i>
<i>lt's the composition of</i>
<i>our water that's unique.</i>
<i>lt's in a liquid state.</i>
<i>no other locations</i>
<i>in our known universe</i>
<i>have liquid h2o</i>
<i>anywhere near their surface.</i>
<i>l just saw a field report that said</i>
<i>they will use our sewage systems</i>
<i>to follow our water</i>
<i>back to their ships.</i>
how'd you get that to work?
these things are everywhere.
there's one off the coast
of 20 countries.
they're calling it
the command-and-control
center.
that's the thing you were tracking?
yeah.
so you're saying that's the thing
that's controlling the drones?
yeah. and if we wipe it out,
we take out their air power.
these bombs better work.
lockett: let's move it.
adukwu: bring him through here.
set him down.
lockett: how much time we got?
nantz:
one minute.
air force about to lay some pain
on those extraterritorial bastards.
nantz: all right, two-five, retreat...
men: hell!
retreat...
hell!
nantz:
here we go.
lmlay:
come on. let's fry
these sons of bitches.
we get to the f.o.b.
after these bombs drop,
get ammo.
and some goddamn reinforcements.
some goddamn tanks.
ten.
mlchele: gotta be strong, okay?
nantz:
nine.
eight.
seven.
six.
five.
four.
three...
shit. everybody, brace!
[beeps]
kerns: they should've dropped.
lockett: what the hell?
wouldn't we have felt that
from here if they'd dropped?
we would've felt them.
would've felt it in nevada
with that ordnance.
that clock right?
that's what l got.
maybe it's a good thing.
maybe we turned the tide.
that's a good thing.
lockett:
you damn straight, lmlay.
we was kicking some ass.
could they have taken out
the whole air force?
this isn't happening.
nantz:
let's move.
everybody, up, up.
let's move. come on.
lmlay:
we're in the home stretch, everybody.
we in the home stretch.
[<i>¶¶¶</i>]
kerns:
now we know why
those bombs didn't drop.
lmlay: they wiped
our forward operating base
right off the map.
all clear, staff sergeant!
nantz:
all right, let's bring him back here.
hang in there, buddy.
million-and-one odds
we'd get here in the first place,
and we get here and
there ain't nothing. l knew
nantz would never get us out.
there were thousands
of marines here.
now it's just seven
of us, lmlay.
you remind me
of my older brother.
how's that?
he never smiles either.
secure the front with harris.
lmlay, anything?
nothing. we only
got maps of santa monica.
we need something farther east.
they're all burned.
nantz:
follow me, lmlay.
all right, here's the
battalion commander's
hooch.
looking for maps,
anything with an extraction point.
staff sergeant.
adukwu:
l'll be right back.
found a tactical map,
staff sergeant. shows where
all the units were deployed.
what the hell
are all these red marks here?
means they're gone.
you mean the units got moved?
wiped out.
all of them?
all of them.
oh, shit.
all right.
one alternate extraction site
is still operational.
lmlay:
that's eight klicks.
staff sergeant? staff sergeant.
adukwu, plenty
of weapons around.
find yourself an m-1 6.
mr. rincon is dead.
wake up, dad.
[hector sobblng]
please help me right now.
don't leave me.
l'm so sorry, hector.
l'm sorry.
hector:
no.
your dad tried so hard
to stay with you.
l'm sorr--
l don't wanna be here.
nantz:
lt's okay, bud.
your father was
a brave man, hector.
hector, l'm sorry.
l'm sorry, buddy.
lt's okay to cry.
he loved you very much.
listen to me, hector.
l need you to be brave
for me. l need you
to be my little marine.
okay?
we gotta be brave
for the others.
do you know why?
why?
because marines don't quit.
do you believe that?
say it for me.
marines don't quit.
good.
l'm gonna get you out of here,
hector. l promise.
let's go see the girls, okay?
come on.
we are not losing one more
of those civilians. understand?
you getting us out too,
staff sergeant?
or are we expendable?
hm?
all right, lockett.
you wanna go there,
let's go there.
l commanded men
and men died.
kids. 1 9 years old.
the best men l ever led.
do you think for one second
that l wouldn't rather
trade places with them?
l know you think
l got my men killed.
they're dead.
l'm here.
like the punchline
to some bad joke.
you think l like that?
do you think a minute goes by
that those faces aren't right here,
seared into my brain?
dante, thomas t. corporal.
ambruster, william r. private.
wharton, jeffrey h.
lance corporal. 8-7-4-2-7-3-9-9-3.
lockett,
duane g.
corporal.
five-five.
your brother
was an outstanding marine.
he was my friend.
and l miss him every day.
and you remind me of him.
none of that matters right now.
because our duty is
to keep moving forwards,
to keep fighting.
that's how we honor your brother
and lieutenant martinez,
corporal stavrou,
lance corporal mottola,
hector's father,
who picked up a rifle
and did what needed
to be done. a civilian.
so we better damn well
step it up.
discard any lingering doubt.
work fast, work as a unit,
and we will prevail.
let's figure out
how we're gonna get out of this.
lmlay, you come with me.
get to higher ground.
the rest of you, find some ammo
and some vehicles.
<i>gotta be a few la v's or armored</i>
<i>humvees still operational.</i>
sorry, bro. you didn't deserve this.
you went down fighting.
lmlay:
holy shit.
l wasn't expecting to see all this.
that don't look good.
reinforcements.
harrls:
holy shit.
they already set up a beachhead.
all right.
lf that evac site is still operational,
l think we can get behind the line.
that's gonna be
one hell of a ride.
yeah, well,
that's what we get paid for.
lmlay:
everybody move to the lav now! go!
any station, this net.
this is foxtrot-two-november.
we have 1 1 passengers.
requesting evacuation at alternate
extraction point charlie.
are there any birds in the air? over.

<i>this is sierra 2-5.</i>
<i>orders are to pull back.</i>
<i>get to extraction point</i>
<i>charlie by 0300</i>
<i>or we'll be gone. over.</i>
roger that.
lmlay, ever see what
a bushmaster chain gun can do?
lmlay: oh, shit, yes, staff sergeant.
nantz: get on it, son.
lockett:
let's do this!
nantz: no lights, kerns.
kerns: roger that.
nantz:
let's move.
bushmaster is locked and loaded.
nantz:
give them hell.
damn right.
[<i>¶¶¶</i>]
two minutes till the helo drops.
everybody okay?
all right, kerns, take a left.
l want you to go over three blocks,
then you go about five blocks,
hang a right, and straight.
that should get us to the evac site.
yes, staff sergeant.
l'd hold on if l were you, lockett!
copy that!
we got hostiles.
mlchele: what's going on?
well, let's not
wait around and find out.
lt's gonna be okay.
got about 250 rounds, staff sergeant.
know what they say
if you hit a deer?
speed up!
nantz: damn straight!
come on!
y'all hold on!
we're gonna have to go
right through them!
whoa! ha-ha-ha!
you saw that?
they're going down like bowling pins!
[yells]
harrls:
kick it out!
run that sucker over, man!
santos, you okay?
l got that nasty stuff
all over my mouth, man!
[laughlng]

[hellcopter blades
whlrrlng]
everyone okay?
mlchele: yes!
let's get us home.

cease fire!
mlchele: stay close, stay close!
harrls: what are we doing?
man:
load them up! our flight path
won't be clear much longer!
you're in the middle
of the shit, sergeant.

pulled back to save our assets!
they were blowing us out!
we're abandoning los angeles!
let's go, lmlay!
man:

[rattllng]
[screamlng]
nantz:

lmlay: everybody all good?
mlchele: girls?
man: everybody okay?
nantz:
hold on tight!
what happened?
pilot said something
was playing hell with our power!
staff sergeant! nine o'clock!
[<i>¶¶¶</i>]
santos, you said you were
tracking massive rf signals?
could a concentration of them
knock out power?
yes, definitely! why?
could be their
command-and-control center!
get me down there!
what?
l gotta recon that area!
no way! lt's a suicide!
damn it, we're the only ones left!
all the other forces have fallen back!
we can't land!
may not have power
to take off again!
this is a letter
for martinez's wife.
will you get it to her?
yeah.
hover at 40 feet!
twenty seconds!
roger that!
come on, adukwu, let's get this off.
staff sergeant, what the hell
are you doing?
we're in the clear!
we're almost home, lmlay!
you're in charge now!
you get
these civilians home safe!
you're the bravest marine
l ever seen, hector!
no!
nantz [whlsperlng]:
everybody, take cover.
l told you
to stay in that helo.
civilians are free and clear.
we were worried about your ass.
l think the command-and-control
asset is nearby.
kerns, how many klicks
to that blackout?
lt's about five klicks, staff sergeant.
five klicks. all right.
we're gonna use this overpass
for cover.
lf we take out those drones,
our military might have a chance
to get back into this fight.
santos,
where would you put
a command-and-control asset
if you wanted to protect it?
underground.
nantz: let's go.
everybody, let's move. come on.
move, move, move.
move.
[allen cllcklng ln dlstance]
[<i>¶¶¶</i>]
they must've gone back up.

to the command-and-control center.
[ln normal volce]

[thuddlng]
[whlsperlng]
let's go. back.
santos:

we're right over
their command asset.
that's it, all right. okay.
let's move the concrete slab,
fire in the hole!
that should give us
a couple minutes.
laser target, staff sergeant?
we don't have any more jets, though.
nantz: they can
fire ground-to-ground missiles
from edwards air force base.
we radio in a strike,
paint the target with the laser.
aye-aye, staff sergeant.
hoorah.
nantz: our best chance at radio
reception is on top of that building,
but it's the most exposed.
l'll do it, staff sergeant.
l'll make the call.
nantz:
santos, you got those codes?
air force strike package
coming up.
you get to high ground.
once you radio in,
they'll track that signal.
things are gonna get real hot.
so once you make that call,
you get the hell out of there,
all right?
you know what that means?
we're gonna have to hold those
things off till the strike gets here.
nantz:
bingo. marines,
we make our stand here.
let those bastards know
who they're fucking with.
retreat...
hell!
