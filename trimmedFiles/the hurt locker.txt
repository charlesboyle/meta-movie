eldridge: oh, i got that.
i figured four blocks, that'll give us
about 20 pounds of bang, total.
that blast is going to roll straight out there.
the shell will probably kick out there,
and most of the shrapnel
is going to shoot straight up
in a beautiful umbrella pattern.
yeah.
we're gonna get some smaller pieces
and shell fragments this way,
but we'll be okay
if we're behind the humvee.
- bring the bot back. we'll load it up.
- no problem.
bot is moving.
sanborn:
let me know what you got, eldridge.
- good to go.

when i get down there,
i'm just going to set it up and we'll bip it.
give these people
something to think about.

- yeah.
- well, while you're here, can you
- help me move this thing real quick?

you know, we get a lot of mortars at night.
you know, the plywood on the windows
help with the lateral fray coming through.
- that's why it's up there.
- yeah, well,
it's not going to stop a mortar round
from coming in through the roof, you know.
besides, i like the sunshine.
hey, uh, i'm sorry to hear about thompson.
- i know he was a good tech.
- yeah, he was.
he was a great team leader, too.
yeah, i'm not trying to
fill his shoes or anything.
you know, i'm just going to do my best.
appreciate it.
all right. cool.
well, home sweet home, right?
[ heavy metal music playing ]
eldridge: aren't you glad the army has
all these tanks parked here?
just in case the russians come,
we have to have a big tank battle.
i'd rather be on the side with the tanks,
just in case, than not have them.
yeah, but they don't do anything.
i mean, anyone comes alongside a humvee,
we're dead.
anybody even looks at you funny,
we're dead.
pretty much the bottom line is,
if you're in iraq, you're dead.
how's a fucking tank
supposed to stop that?
would you shut the fuck up,
owen? please?
sorry. just trying to scare the new guy.
i saw a little bit in afghanistan, too.
should get your eyes on the road, eldridge.

sanborn: hey, james, can you hear me?
what's going on with the smoke
on the side of the road? over.
- james: creating a diversion.
- from what? is there a threat?
eldridge, get up on the wall. move!

when i'm standing over it, cowboy.
[ car horn honking ]

- not much. how are you?
i'm good.
got a question about that song, though,
be all you can be.
what if all i can be is dead
on the side of an iraqi road?
i mean, i think it's logical. this is a war.
people die all the time. why not me?
you got to change the record in your head.
you gotta start thinking about other things.
okay. stop obsessing.
right now, what are you thinking about?
you want to know

you'll get it.
- so, you're a ranger, huh?
- yeah.
i was in intelligence seven years
before i joined eod.
we ran missions in every shithole
that you could possibly imagine.
so, i'm pretty sure i can figure out
a redneck piece of trailer trash like you.
looks like you're on the right track.
see you out there, man.
[ shouting in arabic ]: "get out of the building.."
come on, let's go. move it. move it.
[ speaking arabic over loudspeaker, repeating the warning ]
sanborn: shit. get out of the way. move.

- all right. see any wires? any smoke?
- no. i didn't look.
- all right, so how do you know it's a bomb?
- the car has been parked illegally.
the suspension is sagging.
there's definitely something heavy
in the trunk.
right. so, why don't you walk over there
and peek inside
and tell me what you see?
you want me to go close to it?
[ in arabic ]: "you bull shit!"
yeah. no. i don't. no, i'm kidding.

[ clearing throat ]
sanborn: you know, these detonators
misfire all the time.
what are you doing?
i'm just saying shit happens, they misfire.
he'd be obliterated to nothing.
sanborn: his helmet would be left.
you could have that.
little specks of hair charred on the inside.
eldridge: yeah. there'd be
half a helmet somewhere, bits of hair.
have to ask for a change
in technique and protocol,
and make sure this type of accident
never happen again, you know?
you'd have to write the report.
- are you serious?
- i can't write it.
no. i mean,
are you serious about killing him?
eldridge: twelve o'clock, i see an suv.
sanborn: roger that.
eldridge: i got four armed men.
they're in haji gear.
james: all right. go slow and easy, man.
we're in it now.

- what are you guys doing here?
- we have a flat tire. can you help us?
sure, yeah. you got any spares?
we have spares,
but we used up our wrench.
how do you use up a wrench?
well, the guy over there with the red thing
on his head, he threw it at someone.
[ laughing ]
- all right.
- thank you.
- this is chris. this is the wrench man.
- hello, wrench man.
- that's jimmy.
- you know, you can shoot people here.
- you don't have to throw a wrench.

i picked these guys up in najaf.
nine of hearts, that's one.
and the other, al rawi, jack of clubs.

- team leader: yeah. that's them.
does he need a little help there?
what's the problem with the tire? come on.
no good, boss. this wrench is too small.
all right, solutions? anyone?
i think there's another wrench in the back
of the humvee, if you wanna check.
- i'll give it a try.
- all right. let's do it.
team leader: how long you guys out here?

he says, "i don't wish to die. i have a family.

where...
some guy drove his truck
to the middle of an iraqi market,
starts passing out free candies.
all the kids come running up,
the families and stuff.
he detonates.
they're saying 59 are dead.
you know they need more bomb techs.
you want to chop those up for me?
boing! boing!
[ baby laughing ]
[ music box chiming ]
[ laughing ]
[ baby murmuring ]
yeah.
you love playing with that.
you love playing
with all your stuffed animals.
you love your mommy, your daddy,
your nature pajamas.
you love everything, don't you?
yeah.
[ baby murmuring ]
but you know what, buddy?
as you get older,
some of the things that you love might
not seem so special anymore, you know.
like your jack-in-the-box.
maybe you realize
it's just a piece of tin and a stuffed animal.
as you get older,
there are fewer things you really love.
and by the time you get to my age,
maybe it's only one or two things.
with me, i think it's one.
- welcome to delta company.
- sergeant.
