(by mohammedelsawaf)
show yourself!
i know
you're out there.
(exclaims)
(roars)
(gasps)
help!
help me!
(grunting)
somebody help me!
help!
alas! poor yorick.
i knew him, horatio.
a fellow of infinite jest,
of most excellent fancy.
he hath borne me on his back
a thousand times,
and now, how abhorred
in my imagination it is!
my gorge rises at it.
here hung those lips...
(people laughing)
excuse me.
this is
a private party, miss.
my name is gwen conliffe,
and i'm engaged to your brother, ben.
is ben here?
no.
i'm afraid no one knows where ben is,
which is why i'm here.
clive.
well, boys and girls,
let's repair to the tavern!
good night, sweet prince.
i seem to recall,
miss conliffe...
i seem to recall he mentioned
you in one of his letters.
and it's quite uncharacteristic of my brother
to treat a lady
in such a way,
but the character of man
is such a shiftable thing.
you misapprehend me.
benjamin is missing from blackmoor.
he's gone.
did my father send you?
no, i'm here on my own.
it's been nearly a month
since anyone has seen ben,
and we knew that
you were in london.
i'd hoped you had
received some word.
why do you think
he's in trouble?
because the night he went missing,
two villagers were killed.
would you help us?
miss conliffe,
i am under contract
for the next 30 performances.
if this is about your father,
i know how you feel.
do you?
my company leaves
for america tomorrow.
i simply can't help.
he is your brother.
good night.
it must be
a wonderful luxury,
doing battle with imaginary demons,
mr. talbot.
mine right now are very real.
your mother?
yes.
my oldest memories
of my mother,
we are gathering grapes
in her father's vineyard.
it is my garden of eden.
you're paying yours a visit?
no, my mother died not long
after this was made.
my father and my brother,
they live near blackmoor.
a man needs
a good stick on the moor.
i purchased this one
in gévaudan lifetimes ago.
it's the work of
a master silversmith.
would you do me the honor?
it's beautiful.
it will give me
great pleasure to know that
it was the keeping
of a civilized man.
its heft is somewhat
too much for me these days.
you're overly kind.
but i'm afraid
i must refuse it.
as you wish.
(door creaking)
hello?
(birds twittering)
(wings fluttering)
(snarling)
samson!
lawrence?
hello, father.
ah.
lo and behold,
the prodigal son returns.
i hope you're not expecting the fatted calf.
(samson growls)
stay!
we don't have
many visitors.
you seem well.
i've often wondered
what you look like.
you've come about your brother,
have you?
stay.
yes.
miss conliffe learned
that i was in london...
(samson continues growling)
samson.
...and sent me
a letter
saying that ben
has disappeared.
i thought i'd offer my help
in any which way i can.
yes, what a splendid idea, lawrence.
a splendid idea.
too late,
i'm afraid.
unfortunately,
your brother's body
was found in a ditch by the
priory road yesterday morning.
i assume you have something
to wear for the funeral.
sir john.
you remember my son, lawrence?
singh,
my servant.
master lawrence.
it's nice to
see you, lawrence.
it's good
that you're here.
has miss conliffe
been notified?
mmm-hmm.
she's upstairs in her bedroom, asleep.
(piano playing)
where are they
keeping ben's body?
your father instructed me to bury
your brother's effects with him.
it seems a shame.
thank you.
i wouldn't,
sir. it's...
i missed his whole life.
(people laughing)
montford: what if it wasn't a beast at all,
but a cunning murderer?
someone who bore a grudge
against one of these men.
to misdirect the authorities,
he kills the men,
and then he
tears up the bodies
to make it look like a wild
beast was responsible.
ridiculous!
who would go to such lengths?
what about that gypsy dancing bear?
it could have done it.
(scoffs)
that mangy thing?
kill three men?
i doubt it.
i saw the bodies
with my own eyes.
unnatural wounds.
most unnatural.
made by a fell creature,
i say.
damn gypsies wandering
the countryside,
bringing their woe and deviltry with them.
they show up,
and two weeks later this happens!
my guess is ben talbot
went to their camp
to have it off
with a gypsy whore.
the bear gets
hold of him,
and they dump what's left of him in the ditch!
got nothing to do
with the gypsies.
twenty-five
years ago now,
me pa found him.
quinn noddy
and all his flock.
brains and guts
and god-knows-what
lying all over the moor
for a quarter mile.
and, quinn,
the look on his face.
like he'd been
eaten alive.
whatever did it
was big, had claws,
and didn't mind
a load of buckshot.
after that, me pa went home and
melted down me ma's wedding spoons
and cast silver bullets
on them.
wouldn't leave the house
on a full moon from then on.
he thought it was a werewolf.
i still say
that bear's to blame.
you'd think the talbots would've
learned their lesson, eh?
consorting with the romas.
right. remember that black-eyed
salome the old man married?
went crazy up there
in the ward, killed herself.
she was a gypo whore queen
or some such, wasn't she?
lawrence: yes.
she was crazy
for coming to this
shithole you call a town.
what did he say?
you're in your drink, boy.
get him out of my tavern, nye!
come on, lad.
if you want to do
something about it,
i'll be outside.
my mother wasn't a whore.
lawrence talbot?
(indistinct chattering)
good evening.
please join us.
it's good to see you up and about.
refreshed, recovered
and as enchanting as ever.
please, join us.
good evening, miss conliffe.
good evening.
what a pleasant surprise.
may i recommend
the baked eel?
singh has outdone himself this evening,
haven't you, singh?
something plainer.
thank you.
i was a moment ago
telling my son
that the telegraph system does reach
us here in ionely old blackmoor.
do you find your home
much changed, mr. talbot?
blackmoor does seem
rather the same as i left it.
how so?
the villagers,
they still have the same wild ideas.
yes, well, they're a provincial lot,
i must say,
ignorant and superstitious to a
worldly man such as yourself.
we're savages
at the ends of the earth.
i didn't intend
to start a squabble.
all i'm saying is that you dismiss
the natural man at your peril.
that's all.
i find your insecurities
quite strange, father.
no, you mistake that
for my self-awareness.
and how comfortable are you in your skin,
may i ask?
one can get
used to anything.
excuse me.
you know, lawrence,
i've never understood what it is that you do,
pretending to be
other people.
but i understand you're highly
celebrated and famous for it.
perhaps one day i'll see for
myself what all the fuss is about.
i think your mother
would've liked that.
she loved you and your
brother with all her heart.
why did she do it?
she struggled with life,
as we all do.
she lost.
does that answer
your question?
i saw ben's body today.
what kind of animal
could have done such a thing?
i've seen the work of a kodiak
bear and a bengal tiger,
nature at its most vicious,
but i must say,
i've never seen anything like this.
people in town say
it was a man.
(chuckles)
you mean a raving lunatic
at loose on the moor?
yes, it's possible, but i think i would
have run him down with my dogs.
on the other hand,
the wounds are so terrible
that only something human
would seem capable
of such wanton malevolence.
i found a strange medallion
among ben's belongings.
yes, saint columbanus.
he was an eastern saint.
he was also a gypsy.
so did ben have dealings
with the gypsies?
yes, he was our negotiator.
the local gentry
would pay a fee,
and the gypsies would keep their
criminal activities to a minimum.
and they would move on once they'd
sold the local lads all the wine
and dark-haired ladies
they could stand.
"that orbèd maiden with white fire laden,
whom mortals call the moon,
"glides glimmering o'er
my fleece-like floor..."
"by the midnight
breezes strewn."
she exerts enormous power,
doesn't she?
i wish things were different.
never look back, lawrence.
never look back.
the past is
a wilderness of horrors.
lawrence,
i'm glad you're home.
(soft knocking on door)
can i help you, sir?
i was hoping to have a word with miss conliffe.
just a moment, sir.
(door opening)
miss conliffe.
my behavior was unacceptable.
these were ben's.
he'd want you
to have them.
if there's anything you need,
anything at all, please let me know.
i want to know
what happened to him.
i'll do everything i can.
thank you.
thank you for coming.
(children whispering)
(children giggling)
(laughing)
mother!
mother!
<i>young ben: (whispering)
lawrence.</i>
<i>lawrence.</i>
(distant screaming)
(whispering)
lawrence, wake up.
i heard something.
(whispering)
lawrence.
<i>lawrence, i'm scared.</i>
go back to bed.
(growling)
(growling)
mother?
<i>mother!</i>
(thunder rumbling)
hello.
hello.
ben said that you played here as children.
it was our refuge.
from what?
you mean from whom.
your father,
he has a way
with being distant.
ben told me it was because i
reminded him of your mother.
he said you did,
as well.
which is why he put me in
an asylum for a whole year,
then shipped me off
to my aunt in america.
sir john:
you sure you won't stay one more night?
my father has
lodgings at the inn,
and that's more convenient for the train, so...
when do you
return to london?
not till i find out
what happened to my brother.
(whip cracks)
(horse neighs)
lawrence, that's all
well and good,
but i think your inquiry
could wait until tomorrow.
the moon is full tonight,
and i'd prefer that you stay inside
in the event that your raving
lunatic theory is correct.
i don't want
to lose you, too.
(people chattering)
(dog barking)
take your horse, sir?
good evening.
(speaking romanl)
he says you must stay in the camp.
the woods are not safe.
ask him if he knows anyone who sells these.
boy: you want to
talk to maleva.
to who?
maleva.
it was found on
my brother's body.
your caravan shows up,
three men are killed.
i don't think
it's a coincidence.
there is
no coincidence.
only fate.
but she plays
a hidden hand.
tell me about my brother.
(men clamoring)
(whistling)
man: run
round the back!
(roars)
(people clamoring)
(man shouting
indistinctly)
give us the bloody bear,
you old snake handler.
we know what's
been going on.
nonsense.
he dances, that's all.
(police whistle blowing)
come on! get off!
what's going on here?
we've come
for the bear, nye.
it done
all the killing.
<i>(sighs) for goodness' sake!
he's harmless.</i>
(roaring)
(man screaming)
(gurgling)
(people screaming)
(screaming)
what happened?
it's the devil!
the devil!
(horse neighing)
(roars)
(screams)
mama! mama!
maria!
maria! where are you, maria?
maria!
man: over there!
maria!
maria!
(growling)
(screaming)
mama!
mama!
my baby.
take the girl.
stay in the camp.
lawrence: boy!
boy!
(wings fluttering)
(rock clatters)
(growling)
(lawrence screaming)
(gunshots)
go back, get help!
(gasping)
get maleva!
woman: once he is bitten by the beast,
there is no cure.
you should let him die.
you would
make me a sinner.
there is no sin
in killing a beast.
is there not?
(panting)
(speaking romanl)
sometimes the way of fate is a cruel one.
he can only be released
by someone who loves him.
(groaning)
(speaking romanl)
whoa!
lawrence.
holy mother of god.
help me
with him, singh.
(coughing)
(growling)
(gasping)
"do thou but thine
and be not diffident of wisdom
"she deserts thee not
if thou dismiss not her"
is everything all right?
(clanking)
lawrence?
get dr. lloyd.
are you all right?
yes, i feel better.
(water dripping)
i thought
you were leaving.
well, this place is
impossible to escape.
besides, it's the least i could do.
what did
the gypsies say?
some nonsense about the
devil being at blackmoor.
it's remarkable.
a week ago, i would have said
you'd never use that arm again.
and now?
it seems to have
healed itself.
i'll be back to check on
you at the end of the week.
thank you, doctor.
miss conliffe.
yes?
i want to thank you.
for?
for prolonging your stay here at
blackmoor with us during this difficult time.
had there been some sense
of filial obedience,
well, you would not have been inconvenienced.
well, lawrence was trying to
find out what happened to ben.
and now we know
it's still out there.
nevertheless,
i thank you.
not at all.
you should be
asleep, lawrence.
so should you.
is there anything
i can get for you?
are you
expecting a war?
a sikh is a warrior of god.
he must always arm himself against evil.
do you believe
in curses?
this house has seen more
than its share of suffering.
your mother. your brother.
yes, i believe in curses.
how could you stand it here all these years?
you didn't have
to stay.
silver.
i didn't know
you hunted monsters.
sometimes monsters
hunt you.
yes, he's been quite
seriously injured, inspector,
and he's suffering
from a loss of memory.
i don't think he could be of any use to you now.
well, i think,
at some point,
he is going to want to talk about...
no.
i do understand.
only if i could have
just a few words with him.
no.
a completely unofficial interview.
even the briefest exchange
could be infinitely helpful to me.
(samson barks)
francis aberline,
scotland yard.
honored to meet you, mr.
talbot. i'm a huge admirer.
i'm sorry to hear
of your troubles.
i do hope they won't impede
your return to the stage.
thank you.
shall we?
please.
lawrence: it was an animal.
aberline: you're quite sure?
what else
could it have been?
there are other witnesses, no doubt,
that had a better look than i did.
well...
not too good a look,
i'm afraid.
none of the locals
survived to tell of it,
and the gypsies only talk of demons and devils.
i understood your injury
was quite savage.
yes.
i hope you don't
find this prurient,
but would it be
possible for me
to arrange for a specialist to examine you?
it's amazing what we can discern
by scientific means these days.
and at your convenience,
of course.
of course.
no, a great mystery,
it is,
given that there are no natural
predators left in england
capable of inflicting
such horrific injuries.
well, the savagery of the attack would
suggest the action of an animal.
or a lunatic, perhaps.
someone with a history
of mental disturbance,
who'd spent time
inside an asylum
and who may have suffered
injuries at the hands of his victims.
i get
your implication
and resent it.
you're clearly aware
of my personal history,
as i believe
i am aware of yours.
weren't you in charge of the ripper
case a couple of years back?
well, you're a direct man,
so i'll be equally direct with you.
i'm not your enemy,
mr. talbot.
but you've been seen as hamlet, macbeth,
richard iii,
all with that same face.
now a prudent man would ask who else
might be living inside that head of yours.
good day, inspector.
so you won't mind if i
establish your whereabouts
on the nights in question?
feel free.
good day, mr. talbot.
i'll be sending my specialists to examine you
at your convenience,
of course.
(roars)
lawrence?
yeah.
you all right?
yes.
what did
the inspector say?
well, he asked
a lot of questions.
i'm sorry.
i feel so responsible for what's happened to you.
if i hadn't sent that letter,
you'd be back in new york.
no. no. it was right
that i came back.
you mustn't feel like that.
no.
(giggling)
try it.
well, i can't make it skip like you.
you have to flick it.
may i?
yes.
when you throw it,
turn your wrist up and whip it.
wrist up and whip it.
and make sure
you swing your hips.
(laughing)
what's it like
in new york?
(horses neighing loudly)
(giggling)
did you hear that?
what?
horses.
hello, doctor.
i thought our appointment wasn't till friday.
come with us. it's nearly the full moon.
you were bitten by the beast.
you bear his mark now.
strickland: mr. talbot.
there are many of us here who are
looking for a natural explanation.
help us.
come on, talbot.
show us your wound.
we are told it heals
in an unnatural way.
(horse snorting)
(neighing)
get your hands
off of me.
will you let him murder
your wives and children?
(gunshot)
(neighs)
(exclaims)
(groaning)
montford: my eyes!
damn you, talbot!
sorry, colonel.
i meant to shoot you.
sadly, i'm not the marksman i used to be.
i must be getting old.
he's cursed. god
has forsaken him.
let us deal
with him.
you know you're
trespassing on my land,
and i could shoot you
on the spot right now.
my sikh manservant,
he's on the roof,
and he happens to be a crack
shot with a repeating rifle.
and he will kill you.
he'll kill the next eight of
you before he has to reload,
so please take yourself
off my land.
and if i see any of you
trespassing this way again,
i won't be so civil,
if you take my meaning.
good day to you,
colonel.
lawrence.
you're bleeding.
how could they possibly
think he's a threat to them?
well, he's a stranger here in blackmoor,
miss conliffe,
and that makes him
very dangerous.
thank you.
yes. you can also thank singh
when he returns from the village.
you're not the only one
in the family who can act.
samson!
(samson grunts)
let's get something
to clean that.
did they hurt
your shoulder?
no.
on the contrary,
it feels much stronger than before.
that's good.
i was able
to hold them...
all three of them back.
you know, you mustn't listen to them.
the villagers.
they're backward
and foolish.
everything i hate
about this place.
(heart beating)
(whispering)
this might sting a bit.
lawrence.
excuse me.
(banging on door)
what's happened?
you have to leave.
please pack
your things.
did i do something?
it's not safe here.
you must return
to london tonight.
i'll be out here waiting.
lawrence, wait.
what are you afraid of?
if anything
ever happened to you,
i'd never forgive myself.
(driver urges horse)
(whip cracks)
<i>reverend fisk:
there are those who doubtthe power of satan.</i>
<i>the power of satan
to change men into beasts!</i>
but the ancient pagans
did not doubt.
nor did the prophets.
did not daniel warn nebuchadnezzar?
<i>but the proud king
did not heed daniel.</i>
and so, as the bible says, "he was made
as unto a wolf and cast out from men."
a beast has come among us.
but god will defend
his faithful.
<i>with his right hand,
he will smite the foul demon.</i>
<i>i say to you,

(chattering stops)
pint of bitter,
please.
mrs. kirk.
why aren't you out with macqueen,
trying to catch that thing
what killed my husband?
as i don't know where
the lunatic will strike,
it seems the practical thing to
do is to stay as near as possible
to the potential victims.
(man spitting out drink)
(coughing)
and seeing that 214 of the 309
residents of blackmoor and its environs
live within, what,
i was planning
to spend the evening here.
not talbot hall?
why would you say that?
they're cursed,
all of them.
unfortunately, "cursed"
does not give me a warrant
to wander about sir john's estate at night.
rules, mrs. kirk.
they're all that keep us from a
dog-eat-dog world, you know.
pint of bitter, please.
(humphs)
lawrence,
miss conliffe
has left blackmoor.
yes, i sent her away.
she's probably
in london by now.
why would you
do that, lawrence?
because this place is cursed.
father.
it is a shrine
to your beloved mother.
she was truly
a beautiful woman.
i know that losing her
wounded you deeply.
and it is monstrous,
a young boy seeing his mother like that.
and i would have
given my life, lawrence,
that you hadn't
found us that night.
you must believe me when
i tell you this, lawrence.
you do believe me,
don't you?
i loved your mother with a passion
like the burning of the sun.
her death finished me.
i was devastated.
i still prowl the house
at night,
searching for her.
i'm dead all the same.
look into
my eyes, lawrence.
you see,
i'm quite dead.
my dear fellow,
i wish i could tell you
that the tragedy that has
beset your life was over.
but i'm afraid the darkest
hours of hell lie before you.
i don't think they'll
kill you, lawrence,
but they will blame you.
the beast
will have its day.
the beast will out.

i am sorry to see you back

in the treatment of delusions such as yours.

sir john: lycanthropy.
yeah, lycanthropy.
(inhales deeply)
i contracted the disease, if that's what it is,
in india in the hindu kush.
the natives directed me to a
cave high up in the mountains,
where, according to legend,
lived a strange creature. a very strange creature.
and after a great many days
of climbing and searching,
finally, i came
upon it. i found it.
i found the cave,
and the strange creature that lived there.
<i>it was a little boy,</i>
<i>a little wild feral boy,
powerfully strong,</i>
(snarling)
(chuckles)
who suddenly
attacked me and bit me.
so i returned to my hunting
companions in the valley below
thinking i'd been
made the butt of a joke.
(chuckles)
i soon discovered
otherwise.
(snarls)
you killed my mother.
yeah, i suppose i did.
you should kill yourself.
oh, i cannot tell you how
often i've considered that.
but life is far too glorious, lawrence,
especially to the cursed and the damned
like myself.
yeah.
every night of the full moon,
for many years,
i've been locked away in that crypt
by singh,
my faithful servant.
twenty-five years.
(sighs)
then she came, didn't she?
hot and burning like the face of the moon.
gwen?
yeah, she would have taken
your brother away from me,
and they would have both
vanished into the night forever.
and although i was resigned to it,
the beast in me was not.
and, ben, you understand,
had come to tell me
that he was quite resolute in his
decision to leave talbot hall for good
and to take gwen
away from me.
i became drunk and violent,
and extremely violent.
and i struck out at singh,
who was trying to restrain me,
(laughs)
and i knocked
him out cold.
poor...
poor old singh.
yeah.
you know, i never
told you this, lawrence,
but i used to be
a bare-knuckle prize fighter
when i was a young man
in the ports of boston,
san francisco, new york.
back in the good old days,
before you were born.
long time ago.
bam!
yeah.
anyway, as a consequence, i was unable
to lock myself in the crypt that night.
and i found your brother's body in a ditch
not far from the house.
he'd been torn to pieces.
i know now it was a mistake
to lock up the beast.
don't you think so,
lawrence?
i should have
let it run free.
kill or be killed.
i'll kill you!
(grunts)
you have a long way to go
yet, my young pup.
i'll kill you.
oh your chance is coming
soon enough.
she'll be full tonight,
the moon.
i have a small gift
for you, lawrence,
in the event
you don't find life
as glorious as
i find it to be.
or not to be.
i'm deeply sorry about this, lawrence.
i do love you, dear boy.
you may find that
hard to believe,
in the light
of what has happened.
i'll kill you.
sleep now.
i'll kill you.
rest.
guard?
i'll kill you!
lawrence:
i'll kill you!
(playing harmonica)
(church bell dinging)
dr. hoenegger: i attempted to
remove these mental fabrications,
but now, 25 years later, i find that young
lawrence's harmless hallucinations
have manifested themselves into
delusions of a horrific nature.
ah!
mr. talbot.
(groaning) we are here
tonight to illustrate conclusively
that mr. talbot's fears
are quite irrational.
so we will remain
in this room together,
and once mr. talbot
has witnessed
that the full moon
holds no sway over him,
that he remains a perfectly
ordinary human being,
he will have taken
his first small step
down the long road
to mental recovery.
(audience murmuring)
now, we are all aware
that mr. talbot
has suffered quite traumatic
personal experiences.
he witnessed his mother's
self-mutilations.
his young mind, unable to accept it,
created a fantastical truth,
that his father is to blame.
that his father
is literally
a monster.
(audience murmuring)
but your father
is not a werewolf.
you were not bitten
by a werewolf.
you will not become
a werewolf
any more than i will sprout
wings and fly out of that window.
(all laughing)
(muffled) please, please,
help me.
i think that mr. talbot
has something to say to us.
(coughing)
(softly) stop it.
speak up, mr. talbot.
forgive me,
but we can't hear you.
you moron.
tonight, i will kill
all of you!
(all laughing)
i will kill
all of you!
yes, well, as you
can see, lycanthropy
please do something about it!
is a disease of the mind
existing somewhere in the
deep recesses kill me.
kill me!
of mr. talbot's thoughts.
(groaning)
to him, it seems very real.
(joints cracking)
the subject before you has,
for the past month,
undergone both pharmaceutical
and physical desensitizing
(groaning) in order to reduce
the nervous exaggerations.
(grunting)
(gasping)
(continues chattering
indistinctly)
(growling)
dr. hoenegger?
this malady derives from...
(growling)
man: doctor!

(soft moaning)
(thudding)
(soft gasp)
(wood creaking)
who's there?
lawrence?
(gasping) what are you doing here?
(grunts)
what have they done
to you?
i am what they say i am.
i'm a monster.
and so is my father.
he killed ben.
and my mother, too.
i can help you.
there's no help for me.
if such things exist,
if they are possible,
then everything is.
magic.
and god.
i can find a way to stop it.
i must confess,
i envy my brother for the days he had with you.
what joy
he must have felt.
i would have given
anything i own
to have known you
in another life.
i must get back to talbot hall and end this.
lawrence.
please let me help you.
you already have.
lawrence, don't.
just stay here with me.
stay here with me!

(knocking insistently)

enough the mortal peril you're in
should you find yourself
in his presence.

at a disadvantage.
it makes me happy.

lawrence?
do you feel her presence?
her power?
she'll be here soon.
