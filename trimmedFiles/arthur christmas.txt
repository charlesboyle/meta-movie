gwen:
dear santa, are you real?
if you live at the north pole,
how come i can't see your house
when i look on google earth?
are you saint nicholas?
because you'd be incredibly old.
how do you have time
to read all the letters
from all the children in the world?
and how many cookies and mince pies
have you eaten in all of history?
how do you get all the presents
in the sack?
does your sack have to
get bigger every year
because of exponential
population growth?
and how do you get down
the chimneys?
i put my head in ours
and it's really small.
even if you could squeeze down it
in one minute,
there's nine houses in my road
so that's nearly 10 minutes.
and there are millions of roads
in the world.
it must be so hard being santa
these days.
i mean, what if after all of that,
i'm staying at grandma's?
santa, how can you get round
the whole world in just one night?
my friend said
that you'd have to go so fast,
it would make you and the sleigh
and the reindeer all burn up.
i think you are real.
but how do you do it?
for christmas i would love
a pink twinkle bike with stabilizers.
but please don't bring it
if it makes you and the reindeer burn.
love, gwen hines. 23 mimosa avenue,
trelew, cornwall, england.
arthur:
dear gwen, thank you for your letter
and, heh, brilliant picture.
your request for a pink twinkle bike
will be passed on to santa.
and, yes, do believe in santa.
he is real.
he's the greatest man ever.
and he can get around the world
to every child
without a single reindeer
being roasted ali...
hurt.
by the time the sun comes up
on christmas day, he'll get to you too
using his
special magic.

oh! um...
well, uh, here's to me doing
an even better job next year.
mrs. santa: next year.
arthur: but you're
already perfect, dad.
ha! that turkey did more than him.
ha, ha! aah!

you wouldn't understand, father.
i've rather moved things on
since your day. eh, steve?
forget techno tommy. he's texting

i'm enacting mission closure.

don't matter what you come up with.
you may be next in line, but you'll never

after all the hard work, i wanted
everyone to have some christmas fun.
ta-da!

grandsanta: i'm santa!
steve: no, no, i'm santa. it's ridiculous.
you just took the piece out of my hand.
well, i am actually santa
so i think i should have it.
yes. you're the nonexecutive figurehead.
santa: exactly.
figurehead.
grandsanta: it means
a fatty with a beard who fits the suit.
the other pieces are good too.
or i can make extra santas
for everyone.
why don't you be the candle, steve?
all those bright ideas, eh?
fine. i'm the candle,
arthur's the turkey
and you, father,
are, of course, santa.
grandsanta, you can be
this charming relic.
"relic"? "relic"?
i did the whole of christmas
in one of these, arthur.
oh, yes. i didn't need
a trillion elves in bleepy hats.
we don't fly about
throwing lead-painted toys
down chimneys anymore.
that space sends you back
to lapland.
malcolm, where did you get those?
just moving things along.
do i win?
cheats, the pair of you!
arthur:
mum, are you okay?
polar bear, dear. attacked me on the ice.
good i did that online survival course
or there'd be one less for turkey.
grandsanta: christmas has
gone right down the rodney hole.
you're a postman with a spaceship.
my s-1 festivized the world
at 1860 times the speed of sound.
christmas 1941, world war ii,
did the whole thing with
six reindeer and a drunken elf!
i was shot at, arthur.
took 12 direct hits.
lost three reindeer.
arthur:
what happened
to the elf?
fell out of the sleigh over lake geneva.
never saw him again.
goodness. now...
"christmas crackers.
sing 'silent night' backwards."
who'd know that?
(bell rings)
(singing gibberish)
i went on alone.
i could still do it now, arthur.
just give me a go!
in a heap of sticks.
"heap of... "?
let me up and at him!
i'll show you, robby the robot!
oh, dear. oh, dear.
i'll have that back.
(hoho chimes)
grandsanta: would've won anyway.
what?
oh, yeah. run away
now you're losing!

arthur:
steve!
whoa! unh!
steve.
don't be upset. look.
you keep this.
then you can be santa next time.
that'll be you there, steve.
next year,
i bet.
you'll be great.
how many times, arthur?
it's the north pole. shut the doors.
(door slams)
bryony:
i secured the gift.
gift secured!
just can't be.
the system is foolproof.
it has to be an error, sir.
"error"?
i spotted the ribbon
glinting in the shadows.
i am actually
trained in wrapping.
and i said to myself, "bryony, the
wrapping looks okay. thank goodness.
but that present should not
be lying in the..."
thank you, soldier.
arthur: has someone
got the wrong present?
that's awful.
whose is it?
no one
gets the wrong
present. 47785
bxk.
"gift undelivered"?
they got nothing?
mm-mm?
arthur: a child's
been missed!
not necessarily.
(arthur gasps)
a child's been missed!
wanna wake up the north pole?
good idea. a child's
been missed!
steve: arthur!
(santa yawns)
everything all right?
there's been a glitch.
"a glitch"? we've missed a child!
really? dear, oh, dear.
that's awful.
how did you let it happen,
steven?
how did i...?
i thought it was your mission.
no. this is your department.
what'll we do?
we must, um... we must, uh...
what must we do, steven?
steve: there's nothing to do.
the mission was a success.
we can't leave a child
out of christmas.
(sighs)
sunrise at destination

to get there in time.
except, of course, for the s-1.
the s-1 . right-o.
steve: no! the s-1
has just traveled 7 million miles.
we could damage it.
oh, dear. um...
and risk the lives of the elves.
santa: oh, my. no.
i'll go, sir!
bryony shelfley,
wrapping division. grade 3, sir.
who asked you?
i wasn't called up for field duty.
i served out my mission
in gift wrap support.
i wrapped 264,000 presents
in three days, sir.
if you want that bike delivered
in a perfect state
of enwrapment, then i'm your elf.
steve:
no one is going.
it's impossible.
but this child...
peter: it's a
margin of error
of 0.00000001514834 percent,
i mean, hello?
where's the champagne?
my department has delivered
the most outstanding christmas ever.
oh, uh... ha, ha.
well done, us.
but there's a child without a present.
arthur, christmas is not a time
for emotion.
we will get 47785bxk a present
within the window of christmas.
we'll messenger the item.
it'll be there in five days.
but that'll ruin the magic.
(scoffs)
if there was any way at all
to make the drop tonight.
but it can't be done.
santa:
your brother
knows about these things.
i won't sleep easy after this,
arthur, but there it is.
can't be done.

i can't fly a sleigh. i can't even
ride a bike without stabilizers.
i know, let's wake steve. he'll...
no.
he's a worrier, arthur. what if
he stops us? gwen's forgotten.
you really care.
well, of course
i do. i was santa too.
think of your dad

beard off with worry over this girl.
don't you want to help for once?
make him proud?
i can't.

no! not ye...!
aah! aah!
oh, where's the seat belt?
(arthur grunting)
whoa!
whoo-hoo!
(grunts)
could dad do that? did he
make a snowman for steve?
robot roy?
ha! i should cocoa.
the next santa, and he's
never even sat in a sleigh.
oi!
is that...?
the map of the clauses.
used every christmas night
in history.
whatever your brother says,
arthur,
it's the same old world.
(both scream)
arthur:
what is it?!
no idea. i've never
seen it before.
arthur: it's a city!
a new one?
ruddy cheek.
they're always putting
these things up.
i remember the first time
i ran into chicago.
ha, ha.
chicago wasn't on the map?
grandsanta:
whoa!
now, where are we?
ah. here we are, see?
oh, no, that's peking.
ahead, there's a...!
grandsanta:
whoa!
arthur:
they can see us.
well, pull the camouflage lever.
now, then, we'd better
draw in a few
sky scratchers. just, uh...
not that one.
that's a steam train, you ninny.
arthur:
do this one.
grandsanta: so, what do
they call this place?
"toronto."
toronto's in canada.
the santas always
come through canada.
nobody lives here.
it's nice and quiet.
till your brother came with
his "you can't cut through saigon,
there's a war" rubbish.
don't need him to tell me
what's ahead.
i got eyes.
grandsanta!
ye baubles, an elf.
bryony shelfley. oh!
there's
a small trauma to your giftwrap,
but i can fix it.
a stowaway!
i can wrap anything,
sir, with three bits of sticky tape.
three!
good. wrap yourself a parachute.
aah!
grandsanta!
bryony: aah!
grandsanta: whoops.
(radar beeping)
toronto. present and correct.
not quite, sir. you've lost
one of the reindeer.
(♪♪♪)
quantitative...
(hoho chimes)
hello?
what elf?
peter: bryony shelfley, sir.
the crazy wrapping elf, you know?
security tracked her to sector 19.
and we think arthur was here.
arthur?
who else leaves the door open,
huh, sir?
the old sleigh barn?
that was sealed up
decades ago
after that terrible night
grandsanta sneaked out and...
thank goodness he's too old these days
to get into trouble.
(arthur grunting)
(thudding)
bash it with a brick, arthur. go on.
arthur:
it just won't...
grab its antlers and tug.
i may just be a wrapping operative,
sir, but this contravenes.
man (on hoho): seventeen.
specific mission regulations.
i'm in charge here,
not billy the bureaucrat.
arthur:
it's stuck.
grandsanta:
shh!
eighteen.
elf, wrap your head.
sir!
come on, lad. you're as much use
as a cheese chopstick.
got it!
(gasps)
oh, no.
(bryony mumbling
indistinctly)
oh, my big aunt betty.
it'll have to do. pass it down.
what?
permission to breathe, sir. i have about
nine seconds left before i black out.
one breath.
(gasps)
bryony:
sir?
i said one. hurry up, arthur.
but don't we need a whole one?
you know,
to balance the sleigh?
oh, it won't balance the sleigh. no, no.
if anything, it'll slow us down.
(bryony mumbling
indistinctly)
so why are we taking it?
it's for gwen. eight beautiful reindeer.
that's what she's dreaming of.
the jingly bells, the sleigh on the roof.
yeah, but...
that's what the kids want,
not some spaceship.
we're giving her the star treatment.
what now?
we have a waker, sir.
with a gun!
(gunshot)
grandsanta:
that's it, lad.
you distract him!
arthur: grandsanta!
man: who's there?
arthur:
uh... uh... uh...
we come in peace.
our craft has to
travel around the world
in less than an hour!
(gunshot)
we need a sign for our slei...
craft.
sorry i can't pay you. where i
come from, we don't have
money!
(♪♪♪)
grandsanta:
christmas 1923,
had a heart attack at the reins.
left ventricle popped out me mouth.
pushed it back down and carried on!
(grandsanta &
arthur chuckle)
it's big, isn't it, the atlantic?
think we should stop and ask someone?
pishywibble, we're nearly there!
see, i take the north star there
as a fixed point.
then i plot my bearings from, um...
that's a plane, sir.
insubordination.
i'll have you harpooned, elf.
arthur: i thought it would
be chillier near england.
grandsanta:
globular warming.
ha! land ahoy! there it is.
told you!
arthur:
whoa, whoa, whoa!
grandsanta: there you are. down.
arthur: watch that rock!
grandsanta:
there you go.
ah.
(dasher whimpers)
arthur:
wow.
england.
(yells)
maybe we pulled to the right a bit.
we're a reindeer short.
france.
(speaking in french)
(elephant trumpets)
they have elephants in france?
the odd stray. they breed
in the drains. this way.
(grandsanta speaking
in spanish)
paris zoo.
bryony:
then this is
where they keep the lions!
grandsanta:
they won't eat me.
i'm santa!
lie down!
oh, right.
call the keeper!
arthur:
how old is this?
"atlantis"?
"here be cannibals"?
watch out for cannibals.
(all yell)
(bryony whimpers)
this isn't france, is it?
technically, it's known as africa.
aah!
serengeti national park, tanzania.
how can you possibly be sure?
the gps on my hoho.
take her!
take the elf!
gps? why didn't you say?
i'm a wrapping elf. i don't navigate,
i wrap. i use it to store pictures of bows.
she's right. you brought us to africa!
i've seen it on a stamp.
(roaring)
i'm too young to die, arthur.
do something. arthur!
steve: the old sleigh.
what is happening here?
was supposed to be chopped up
for firewood decades ago.
how did that devious...?
old people, sir.
shall i get you your stress ball?
we have finer
comms than the pentagon,
and you say
we can't contact him
except by some ancient...
ernie:
toodle-loo!
here comes the cavalry!
ernie clicker, sir.
head of polar communications
for 46 missions!
oh, crikey blikey,
me and your granddad
saw some times!
i remember once...
wow, must catch up soon. now...
oh, you're in a hurry. i can tell.
(both cough)
oh, this is ridiculous.
could we hurry this?
ooh... you can't rush the signalator.
got to play her gentle.
so, what do you wish to say?
i wouldn't worry. it's not like
they're facing man-eating lions.

grandsanta:

whoa!
grandsanta:
what's so funny?
look what they've done to my evie.
and the map.
but it's okay.
we've got this. look!
mimosa avenue, trelew.
man (on hoho):
proceed to the highlighted route.
what's the point? look at us.
and my camera, totally banjaxed.
how do i get my picture now?
what picture?
the sleigh on the roof,
the eight beautiful reindeer
and santa... me!
...going down the "chimbley."
that's what i wanted them to see.
they missed the kid, but i got there.
my way.
that's why you came. not for gwen.
for the love of lulu,
bossed about by tinpot tom.
dash!
try them again.
keep trying.
all this for one child.
in 600 million.
we should turn her off a mo.
don't worry, sir. children are
stupid. either it won't know
it got missed
or it'll think it's been bad.
it's a win-win.
you missed one?
a nipper? cor!
ha, ha. what's all this here for
if you miss one?
could you please type faster?
all right.
computer:
systems critical.
lead in christmas.
ernie:
oops-a-daisy.
steve:
peter,
let go of my hand, please.
peter:
yes, sir. sorry, sir.
and get me it.
(♪♪♪)
man (on hoho):
descend 1000 feet.
you are at your destination.
arthur: yes!
we did it, we did it!
we did it! hooray!
whoopee-doo.
in 100 yards,
turn left.
straight ahead, left, right.
you are at your client's dwelling.
whoa, whoa!
hey, steady!
we made it. i survived!
i'll walk home, i'll get a boat,
but i am never getting back
in that crazy flying death trap
ever again!
(bicycle bell rings)
grandsanta:
go on.
get it over.
i want my bed.
what, you're not coming?
you have to deliver the present.
you've got your special coat on.
you're our santa.
i said me and evie could get here,
and we did.
the rest is just elf work.
go on, festive freddie,
sling your hook.
it doesn't matter
how we got here.
the sleigh on the roof,
the jingle bells, the eight reindeer.
gwen would never have seen that.
(♪♪♪)
(arthur sighs)
arthur (whispers):
i wish dad could see this.
it would take such a load off his mind.
(whispers)
so, what are your orders?
hmm?
you're a claus.
you give the orders.
do i? oh! um... heh.
i'm just happy being an elf, really.
you know, just part of it all.
(sighs)
you want to order me
to go through the cat flap?
oh! um... yes, that's a great idea.
do you want to tell me to let you in?
brilliant. thank you, bryony.
(alarm beeps)
bryony:
and do you want to...?
quick!
the alarm? definitely, yes.
(♪♪♪)
is this
your first time?
(bryony gasps)
(gasps)
but...
(♪♪♪)
bryony?
(alarm wailing)
(barking)
sorry.
he likes these slippers
even more than you do!
happy christmas.
bryony (in normal voice):
when you put the address into
the hoho, what did you see?
(in normal voice) a list of trelews.
i just clicked on the first one!
which was not trelew, england.
we're in the wrong trelew!
(police sirens wailing)
(♪♪♪)
what's going on?!
they've been watching us.
they've seen evie.
it's just like last time.
reporter: governments tonight
are waking to news of a ufo
traveling the globe at incredible speed.
bryony: that's us!
the clearest
sighting was at
this tractor dealership
in idaho.
had eyeballs on its feet
and a pointy little head.
it asked me for a sign.
bryony: we're on the news.
reporter: from the trail in toronto,
these beings do not appear friendly.
computer: rebooting.
we are online, sir.
woman 1: this is
charlotte. mexican
police found a furry thing
trying to mate with a dog.
man 1: i have calls
reporting a steam train flying around.
man 2:
steam train? been on the eggnog?
man 3: it's gone black over mexico.
this thing's going faster
than anything we know of.
steve: no.
the herd is now in
mozambique's airspace,
threatening the fragile peace
between the two nations.
two billion items delivered, and we
didn't leave a footprint in the snow.
and now...
doug: sir?
we have lost 80 percent of our data.
no, no. we have 18 pulse
data reservoirs of a trillion terabytes!
sorry, autosave was off.
shall i slap him, sir?
quite hard?
deborah:
sir,
there's a polar bear on level 6.
sir? why is
arthur out there?
ernie:
he missed one.
a nipper.
i mean,
(all gasp)
(barking)
sir, we've got something.
bryony shelfley, it's her hoho.
we can still get there.
we just have to go faster, higher!
you've changed your tune.
i'm not going anywhere.
i'm not here!
arthur:
i've taped myself in! grandsanta!
leave me. it's that
terrible night all over again.
what night?
last time i took evie for a spin.
i didn't know
it was the cuban missile crisis!
i nearly started world war iii.
bryony:
hold still. someone has to drive.
whoopsie!
arthur:
oh, no!
fencer!
mincer! come back!
(sirens wailing)
bryony!
bryony:
hi-yah!
(arthur screams)
arthur:
grandsanta,
get here!
oi! that's me new hip.
please, i'll read you gwen's letter.
grandsanta:
stone-deaf. i'm 136.
(hoho chimes)
what's that?
it's steve.
steve!
grandsanta: tell him
i'm not here!
grandsanta says he's not here.
hi. i'm looking for a missing relic.
steve, three words.
is the first one "help"?
arthur: yes.
you can help us, steve!
it was him!
frosty the madman.
he forced me to come.
elf, back me up
if you want a career.
i forced you?
you see? look.
what did you want, grandsanta?
let me guess. hm.
a picture of you in the sleigh
delivering the gift
to show me how it's really done?
no.
you know the picture
they'll have tomorrow?
you, led away in handcuffs!
the santa who was seen.
by everybody on earth.
the santa who ruined christmas.
ruined it!
we'll fix this, steve. we'll be back home
in the wobble of a reindeer's buttocks.
and evie can go back in mothballs.
you can forget she ever existed.
you can't just go home.
what about gwen?
gwen. for that, you'd threaten
my whole operation?
steve, you said if there was any way
to get there, you would.
well, this is it. look.
the old sleigh is perfect!
uh, right. well, anyway, it goes
really fast, even with bits missing.
and we've got quite a few
reindeer left.
and, if i'm sick again,
i could be sick in a bag.
i'll wrap him one.
we can help them.
no one missed, sir!
all correct presents,
present and correct.
arthur:
if you help us, steve,
we can do it!
thomas:
grandsanta and arthur would be
the heroes of the night, sir!
come home now!
if we all just gave in
to christmas spirit, there'd be chaos.
unh! we're on our way, steve.
no!
santa will want us to get to gwen.
ask him. please.
steve:
arthur,
this is dad we're talking about.
there was a time when he cared about
every last gift tag, but now
he just wants to be loved
and get some rest.
no. he's lying awake,
worrying his beard off about gwen.
(line rings)
santa:
ho-ho-ho. off to the land of nod.
please do not disturb
until december 26th.
is that it, dear?
mrs. santa: yes.
press the red...
(machine beeps)
no.
santa's the most caring man
in the world.
so why are you here,
not him?
(grandsanta grunts)
(all screaming)
(all grunt)
don't leave me, arthur!
poor old man and his reindeer,
on our own at christmas?
at least have the decency
to finish us off with a rock!
(♪♪♪)
poor evie.
sun'll be up soon.
it's christmas!
christmas is for kids.
you grow out of it.
what, in the last six minutes?
i know what you all say about me,
you know.
(scoffs)
(in high-pitched voice)
"he belongs in the south pole."
(imitating santa)
"dear arthur, what a puzzle."
(♪♪♪)
(in normal voice)
well, you were right.
all that fuss over one kid.
i was being ridiculous.
(sighs)
this is nice.
it's good to get away from it all,
you know.
all the christmas fuss.
(grunts)
i'm sorry i messed things up, lad.
you see,
the night i last took evie out
when there was all that fuss,
your father came to me.
i'll never forget it.
couldn't look me in the eye.
"dad," he says.
"steve thinks it best
you don't fly again.
we're scrapping the sleigh."
me own son
who used to sit where you sat,
looking up at me.
i just wanted them to remember
who i used to be.
i was a bit like you, lad.
keen as cranberry.
so was your dad.
you get old, that's all.
everything changes.
does it?
how can i ever write another letter
saying that santa cares?
(♪♪♪)
(wavering squeal)
good night, dad.
sleep well.
(santa snores)
(knock on door)
oh!
sir, we know you shouldn't
believe rumors, but we do.
is it true you missed a child?
me? no, no, no.
well, uh, in a way, yes.
(all gasp)
it was just one.
in fact, not even that.
naught point lots more naughts,
then a number
and some sort of percent at the end.
not really an error, just a one.
one child doesn't matter?
which one?
well, i... it's not that...
seb:
i did nine ones in greece.
did those matter?
fergus: what about my ones
in germany? one of them was twins!
they don't matter half each.
um... why don't you ask steve?
he can explain. fiendishly clever.
but aren't you in charge, sir?
of course. i'm santa.
thomas:
sir,
if the one that got missed
doesn't matter,
why have arthur and grandsanta
gone to take it?
what?
malcolm, what's this about arthur?
(elves clamoring)
elf 1:
he's crazy.
deborah: is there a list of
children who don't matter?
santa said they don't matter
elf 2: is it true children aren't
real, they're just antimatter?
shh, shh! do not... look. look!
i festivized every single country
in the world. you see?
this one, this one, this one.
all of them.
i mean, who cares about
one single tiny child?
(all gasp)
uh... i do.
arthur.
my poor boy.
why on earth would he...?
you're his brother, steve.
how could you let him?
and about this child you missed,
i'm really not sure
you made the right decision.
is that bird doo
on your shoulder?
right.
over there is satellite
tracking, navigation, data analysis.
coffee machine's by the door.
good night, santa.

i've seen this before.
sleigh fever, they call it.
pressure of christmas
sends a man doolally-tap.
santa claus xvi got it, 1802.
every child that year got a sausage
nailed to a piece of bark.
unh! whoa!
arthur, do you really think you can
row the atlantic ocean in the next
it's not,
unh, too late yet.
i just have to keep,
unh, going.
we need a blunt instrument.
knock him out and regroup.
man (on hoho): make a legal u-turn,
then slight right in 4228 miles.
you do know
we're going round in circles?
you know, we're not the only ones.
maybe i will see evie again.
what do you mean?
grandsanta: reindeer are
brave, powerful beasts
but they're also dappled cretins
with twigs on their heads.
they'll just keep going in a
straight line right round the world.
they'll be way up in the sky, flying
at unimaginable speed,
but they'll pass
right over our heads.
great!
we can get the sleigh back!
(♪♪♪)
chief de silva.
where is this ufo?
it's circling the earth, ma'am.
nineteen minutes ago,
it went into orbit.
you? up there?
catch that with this?
magic dust.
you crack it over your head.
you'll have to focus. the sleigh'll be
coming at you at 45,000 miles an hour.
grandsanta: you'll be torn
in half!
depends on the angle the sleigh hits.
you might just get beheaded.
i've got a phobia of being beheaded,
and heights and speed and reindeer
and buttons.
buttons?
yeah, i'm pretty much scared
of everything.
gwen thinks you're coming. ah!
you can't do this. yes, you can!
no, you can't. yes, you can!
come on, arthur!
don't worry. only a raving lunatic...
i have to worry!
it's the only thing i'm good at!
(gasps)
worry me.
the sleigh'll be back
any minute.
come on. worry me, quickly!
imagine gwen, all alone,
nothing under the tree.
here we go. unh.
(yells)
no! don't like this! stop! stop! stop!
get me down!
the tears as she finds
she's been left out.
screaming, "santa didn't come!"
oh, gwen.
no! it's just
too high!
bryony: gwen in the street
surrounded by kids
on new bikes, pointing:
"that's the girl
that santa hates!"
she runs away, alcoholic by the age of 9.
dead before she's even...!
she may never build
a snowman again!
(arthur yells)
what if there are buttons on the sleigh
i don't know about?!
here it is!
um...

how do you think he's, uh...?
fine, fine. probably just, uh...
(♪♪♪)
(screaming

(whistling
"good king wenceslas")
so how come they didn't
scrap the sleigh, sir?
i threatened the elves.
said i'd feed them to the polar bears.
(clears throat)
whoa!
(grunting)
elf, how do you fancy being the one
to tell his parents about all this?
(yelling)
(grunts then
whimpering and yelling)
whoa! whoa!
whoa!
(arthur screaming)
(bryony coughing)
(wheezing)
yay! arthur!
you did it!
i did it with worry!
oh, i was sure you'd die.
it was great!
man (on hoho):
proceed to the highlighted route.
(in wavering voice)
proceed to the highlighted.
just keep worrying
about gwen.
i'll find a way there, boy.
whatever it takes.
to trelew!
margaret.
hand me my me suit.
all sorted. steve's, uh...
holding the fort
while i deliver the present, yes,
and find arthur and father.
well done, dear.
trelew's on a course of 187.7 degrees
from the geographic pole
but as it's the old sleigh,
allow a drift margin
of 1000 miles either side
of the meridian.
got a sweater for arthur,
your father's pills,
and some nice sweet tea.
hm.

malcolm,
there's no harm in using a manual.

margaret, i order you to disembark.
it's not safe. unh!
piffle. i did a microlight flying course
on the internet.
it can't be that different.
oh! steve.
you've dented it!
you take it out without asking?
malcolm, you told me
he knew.
you know how steve feels
about his s-1.
it's my s-1 . s for "santa."
i'm flying to this child.
of course she's all that matters.
not me, your son.
not the 2 billion things
i did right tonight.
no!
this is about that pool table,

i was 8. you're my dad!
for goodness sake!
arthur and grandsanta are out there
probably not wearing
nearly enough layers
and you two are bickering over
a big red toy?!
i'm not bickering.
if steven could just
stand back... ooh!
computer:
air bag.
you drive, steven.
thank you.
so since gift delivery
to child 47785bxk
is all that seems
to matter,
i'll do it myself.
then we'll pick up arthur and grandsanta
from whatever ditch they ended up in.
maximum thrust.
um, when santa
said he'd be right back,
what do you think he...?
he's not coming back!
the santas are leaving!
children don't matter?
christmas doesn't matter!
nothing matters!
it's like 1816!
(all gasp)
abandon the north pole!
deborah: everybody, panic!
computer: are you sure you want
to delete christmas?
meltdown: 10 minutes.
elf 1: head south!
elf 2: it's all south from here, you fool!
(♪♪♪)
i know where we can find
a map, lad!
a bit
risky, this.
breaking the rules,
even in the old days.
(♪♪♪)
there!
biggest map in the world!
dash!
de silva: friends, on this night
of peace, we stand confronted
by an unknown danger.
aliens. aliens from space.
man 1: blast them from the skies!
woman 1: let us do an autopsy.
but maybe the aliens come in peace?
they burst an inflatable
santa claus in toronto.
on christmas night!
woman 2: what a terrible thing.
de silva: let us attempt contact,
but be ready to save our planet.
grandsanta:
hold tight, lad. this is where it gets
really rough.
(grunting)
(all yell)
not now,
you sack of antlers.
(all cheering)
man (over pa):
alert level six.
it's coming down through
the atmosphere.
we'll see it.
forty-six, 45,
they'll be waiting for us, sir.
we were on the news.
all their technology
against my evie.
oh, come on. let's do it with worry!
santa mustn't be seen, eh, lad?
let's give them
something to shoot at.
we have visual.
here it comes.
(all gasp)
grandsanta:
take us to your leader. ha-ha-ha!
arthur:
england!
grandsanta:
no sign of anyone.
arthur: the sun's coming up!
come on, lad! you can
do it! move your hooves!
mankind greets you. do you copy?
season's greetings from mankind.
good morning, do you copy?
the hull is some kind of
woody substance, ma'am.
like wood.
coated in lead paint.
the engine
seems to be alive.
and furry.
grandsanta:
come on, lad!
put your back
into it!

arthur:

we made it!
yay!
not quite.
dash!
(♪♪♪)
it's right up me steam pipe!
it's tracking
something electronic!
we haven't got
any "electrickery."
just wood
and brass and...
oh, dear.
bryony & grandsanta:
your slipper!
we have lock.
we got to get you
down there, lad.
they'll see us! we'll be stopped!
give me that.
what are you doing?
it's evie they're after.
she doesn't fit this world, arthur.
she's a relic.
evie?
i always knew she'd be needed
one more time.
you go on. we'll let them have her.
you're coming too.
you were right, arthur. it doesn't matter
how santa's gift gets there.
doesn't even matter if it's
mr. postman in his spaceship.
as long as it gets there.
you made it happen, lad.
no one got left out.
get off.
now, do as i say.
man:
they're firing on us!
a death ray!
made of chocolate
and oranges.
woman: unidentified
varnished object,
turn back or we shoot.
go!
turn back.
happy christmas!
in santa we believe!
go on, elf.
you too.
hi-yah!
de silva:
fire missiles.
this is it, old fella.
maybe the next
santa never sat in my evie,
but arthur did.
and he's as good a man
as any santa there's ever been.
(♪♪♪)
yah!
goodbye, evie.
(all sigh)
thank you, everyone.
you just saved christmas.
(both yell)
(♪♪♪)
steve:
trelew.
out with the old, in with the new.
well done, dear.
poor arthur.
he tried so hard.
he's flunked again.
of course
he hasn't, dear.
we're here. the little girl
will get her present.
i think he's done rather splendidly.
my margaret.
(doorbell rings
over monitor)
good morning, gwen.
ho, ho, et cetera.
apologies for the minor delay.
i'm sure that even a child
can understand
that in an operation
as complex as christmas,
there's always an insignificant
margin of error,
which is you. as a gesture,
i've upgraded you
to the glamorfast ultra x-3
which retails at 9.99 more
than your requested gift.
bigger ergo better.
if you wouldn't mind
just signing a legal waiver?
(speaking in spanish)
pedro? a boy?
a spanish boy?
this is an error.
(speaks in spanish)
now get off the bike.
(boy cries)
will you get...?
no, no, no. please don't cry.
no cry-o.
(dog barking over monitor)
no, uh, "sob-idad."
uh...
it's over a mile.
we've got no sleigh,
no reindeer,
and you can't even walk.
what are you doing?
(♪♪♪)
i can cycle!
oi! come back!
what about
the wrapping?!
arthur:
the church. she lives by the church!
happy christmas, cows!
computer: meltdown. ten seconds
to figgy flensburg. snowman.
german, leave out the carrot.
is santa on shoe?
what the...?!
look, everyone! it's arthur!
he's delivering the present.
it's arthur.
elf: hooray for arthur!
computer:
meltdown paused.
bryony:
come back!
(grandsanta coughs)
oh, my head.
ye baubles,
a beautiful young reindeer.
ah. so who am i, then?
(grunts)
okay, so i'm not great
with children.
does that make me a bad santa?
you're hardly perfect.
let me guess. you put in the address,
you saw a list of trelews
and just clicked
on the first one?
you're just like arthur.
am i?
computer: north pole,
deborah:
but, sir,
it's arthur. he's still going.
elves (chanting):
arthur! arthur! arthur!
arthur?
(♪♪♪)
yah!
no one gets an unwrapped present
on my watch.
three bits of sticky tape.
three.
stand up!
finger!
arthur:

there's always time for a bow.
(♪♪♪)
no, we can't be too late.
(♪♪♪)
(arthur grunting)
(♪♪♪)
unh. it's so unfair.
(grunts)
ho, ho, ho!

elves:

(grunts
then chuckles)
(♪♪♪)
(whispers)
dad!
you came! i knew you would.
you wouldn't just go to bed
and forget gwen.
you're santa!
steve (whispering):
give me that.
i'm santa! i'm delivering it!
(whispering) don't be silly, i'm santa.
can't you see from me suit?
(whispering) i am actually santa,
and i think it would be best...
i'm santa! you handed over!
i didn't, in fact, technically...
you said i could drive!
i'm santa, you naughty boys.
here, have a bonbon.

gwen:

arthur:

from santa.

steve: unh!

(♪♪♪)
too busy.
i'm not good at...
in my day, a pat on the back
and a walnut went a long way.
gwen: mummy, daddy, come on!
look, a ribbon to downstairs!
dad: come on, then.
gwen: i think it's under the tree!
oh, look!
what is it?
i can see pink!
it's a bike!
oh! heh.
santa brought me
the bike i wanted!
mom:
did he?
gwen: oh. can i have a go? please,
please, please? ha-ha-ha.
steve,
you deserve to be santa.
but, steve,
i wonder if gwen is right.
(bicycle bell ringing)
(gwen giggling)
gwen:
watch out. beep, beep. careful,
i'm gonna bump into you.
oh, no.
(♪♪♪)
i'll be the candle, eh?
whoopee!
you're better men than...
(sniffles)
both of you.
gwen:
oh! a bike and
a squirrel!
huh?
gwen: oh!
dad: whoa!
