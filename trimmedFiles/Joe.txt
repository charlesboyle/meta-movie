hey, old man, you look at me.
i got something to say to you.
every time we land someplace new,
you say it's gonna be
different, but it ain't.
you mess up a lot,

for me and mama and
dorothy to clean up
and that ain't right.
that's all i'm saying.
hell, i do what i gotta do.
you do whatever the hell you want,
whatever you can get away with.
you're just a selfish old drunk.

i'm talking at you.
what you done this time,
they'll beat your ass to shit.
that's what they're gonna do.
you can count on it.
<i>service but was looking at some

<i>with a little
thunderstorm complex...</i>

out of mexico and also
out into the gulf of mexico,
meeting up
with this frontal system,
which is slowly being...
been sagging southward.
as we look at temperatures
with the cloud cover,
<i>not as hot as what
we've been seeing,</i>
<i>but the cool-down isn't
related to canadian air.</i>
<i>here's some canadian air over the
northeastern part of the country.</i>
<i>very high dew points.</i>
<i>this represents a whole lot
of moisture available to us</i>
<i>and to those tall clouds
producing the heavy rains.</i>
<i>so the showers and thunderstorms

nedermeyer land.
the owner hires us to
get rid of what's on it
so they can come in
and put strong pines on it.
<i>nobody wants these trees.</i>
<i>these trees are weak.</i>
<i>they're not good for anything.</i>
these boys will sit down if
i don't stay on their asses.
- hey, mister.
- yeah?
<i>i got a question for you.</i>
you see, me and my daddy
just got into town.
i was wondering if
you'd give us a job.
we're looking for work.
- how old are you?
- 15.
well, you got 45 seconds to
tell me why i should hire you.
i baled hay before,
i worked on a truck.
i picked tomatoes,
zucchini, cucumbers.
uh, okra. squash.
all right. you're not
afraid of work. good.
- what's your name?
- gary jones.
i'm joe.
i pay a day's pay for a day's work.
i pay on fridays, so you get
a little something today.
- okay.
- <i>but your first real payday is next friday.</i>
we start about 6:00 in the morning,
<i>quit at 1:00 or 2:00.</i>
and if we work till dinner or get
rained out, i pay for the whole day.
- does that sound fair enough?
- yes, sir.
<i>all right. follow
this line of trees...</i>
- yes, sir.
- close to a half mile back to my truck.
- juice hatchets are in the back.
- <i>yes, sir.</i>
you get yourself one,
fill it up with poison,
come on back same way you went out.
- yes, sir.
- and don't get lost.
- i won't.
- hey!
don't you want to know how
much you're getting paid?
- how you doing?
- good.
doing all right?
you ready to work today?
- yes, sir.
- i'm junior.
- gary.
- well, gary, i'm gonna be over you today.
raise your right hand. you're gonna have
to swear you're gonna work hard for me.
not that hand, your right hand.
your other right.
your right hand. there you go.
<i>put your hand up. you got
to swear on something.</i>
now you on the all-star team.
- you promise to work hard?
- yes, sir.
i don't know why joe chose you.
you must be a good man.
first thing we do
is fill these containers up,
so we just gonna
put it in there like that.
once we get it filled up
real good, then we on.
- what's in the poison?
- shit.
shorty's grandmas
make this in they basement.
i don't know what's in it, but
we ain't gonna worry about it.
i know it works real good.
you thought that was easy
pumping that thing, didn't you?
i made it look easy
'cause i'm a man.
you're a little boy... you got to figure
it out. you see what i'm saying?
there you go. see how
you figured that out?
when you become a man, you gonna
have everything figured out too.
be careful. now this
stuff is real poisonous
and if it gets in your eyes,
man, you're out of there.
just ask junior.
now... now here you go.
- which hand you use?
- uh, the right.
okay.
prime it up a little
bit, keep striking it.
if you hit it hard enough, you only
have to hit it three or four times.
gotta get angry at the tree,
man. get mad at it.
yeah, i like that. get mad at it.
keep on working it.
mad. work with it, work with it!
yes, sir. get it!
keep on with it, youngster.
i like that, man.
joe's been around, he's been
around a little bit, man.
he's got some things
up under his belt, man.
so i advise you,
when you do go to joe,
keep it real with joe. don't
lie to him about nothing.
and one thing joe is real
particular about, man...
don't never look down at the
ground. look him in the face.
he likes to see a man's eyes.
you... one-on-one.
- that's how joe is, man.
- where you from?
- everywhere.
- everywhere?
being a little bitty boy,
you been everywhere, huh?
was your daddy in the
military or something?
oh, yeah? all right. you got
a family? all right, then.
you know we ain't gonna cut you
no slack out here, don't you?
just 'cause you're young now,
you know we ain't
gonna cut no slack.
<i>everybody pull their
own load, baby.</i>
once we get this filled up here,
we can kill us about a hundred
trees with this here.
is killing trees against the law?
well, the lumber company
can't cut 'em down
unless they dead,
and so the lumber company hire us
to come in and poison the trees
so we can kill 'em and they'll
come in and die theyself.
yeah, i've been doing this
for a little minute now.
- welcome to the program.
- thanks.
it's hard work out here.
the machete crew is the one that
comes through and clears it out.
chop down at the angles.
try to get as low as you can.
you gotta clear the path
for your teammates.
without you, none of
this is gonna happen.
just keep hammering at it.
nothing's stopping you.
you have to start out...
you'll probably be
the water man for
a little while, you know?
it's gonna look like you're
doing everything for everybody,
bringing 'em water. at the end,
you'll become a machete vet.
samurai king, right here.
- waa-ah!
- waa-ah!
welcome to the crew.

there's nothing i can do,
and i hate it.
that's not true.

<i>you look at me like
i can make a move.</i>
<i>what are you thinking when</i>
<i>you look at me like that?</i>
<i>don't you care?</i>
<i>i don't know who i am.</i>
<i>but i know what keeps
me alive is restraint.</i>
<i>it keeps me out of jail.</i>
<i>keeps me from hurting people.</i>
hey.
<i>the mark of some fucked-up
faith that there is a reason.</i>
thank you.
<i>a reason for all of this.</i>
<i>a reason in most moments
i shouldn't do what i want to do.</i>
<i>i do as i'm told.</i>
<i>these men who bust their asses</i>
<i>work like dogs.</i>
<i>i believe in them,</i>
<i>but every day, they hurt.</i>
<i>they get old, they peel back.</i>
<i>there's no frontier anymore.</i>
allan.
clark.
gary.
<i>and i watch that boy,</i>
<i>and i see someone</i>
<i>who's nothing like me,</i>
<i>but he's a child</i>
<i>folks left behind...</i>
<i>with no defense.</i>
<i>balanced right there.</i>
what do you want?
<i>- what is it you want?</i>
<i>- nothing.</i>
<i>just tell me what i can do.</i>
<i>i like you.</i>
<i>i like you too, but what's
the point in any of it?</i>
<i>fuck to this day.</i>
<i>i mean, fuck to this day.</i>
<i>it's all just gonna boil up</i>
<i>and wash us away.</i>
<i>and he'll still be here.</i>
<i>or maybe he won't.</i>
damn, joe, why do you keep loading all
these fools in this little truck?
good to have you
with us again, sammy.
you drop down any more,
we're gonna have to
get out and push,
and i ain't pushing shit.
i thought you had your
eye on a new truck, joe.
i ain't getting no new truck.
- you need one.
- no, i don't.
if you get a new truck, how
much you want for this old one?
you mean this old piece of junk?
smell like somebody done
died up in there. it's nasty.
i don't mind the smell. i like it.
it smells good to me.
yeah, but this thing...
i spend as much time working
on it as i do driving it.
'course there ain't
nothing major wrong with it.
just little shit. you know,
it needs some brakes.
it needs a new...
joe, come on.
i'll buy it from you.
i'll work my butt off.
i love the truck. you have
to give it to me now.
well, i mean, it's got
a lot of miles on it.
you'd be better finding
one in town somewhere.
i don't want one in town.
i like that one.
come on, joe.
all right. i'll take $900 for it...
if i get a new truck.
all right. shake hands.
that's what i'm talking about.
heck, yeah.
<i>all right, hey, y'all, let's go!</i>
hey, what you got there?
hey.
i was wondering if maybe
you could tell me
how to get down to water valley.
<i>my wife, she's in</i>
<i>the hospital down there.</i>
<i>i just now got here.</i>
<i>you know how far it is?</i>
is that the highway
that goes to it?
<i>is it?</i>
what you drinking?
- nothing.
- nothing?
you ain't drinking
some wine, are you?
i may.
yeah, nothing wrong with that.
some folks think a feller
ought not drink at all,
but a little drink
never hurt nobody.
that's right.
i get me a little drink every now and
then when i'm down at the house,
but the old lady, she raises
so much sand about it,
i don't do a lot
of drinking down there.
i usually wait till i get
uptown like i am now.
grab me a drink.
she all right?
yeah, yeah. she is today.
that's why i'm trying to get down there
to water valley, go see about her.
i was supposed
to have got paid today,
but the old fella,
he never showed up,
you know, so i think i'll
go get me a little drink,
go down to water valley
and go see how she's doing.
she in the hospital?
yeah, she's in the hospital.
she got cancer.
just eat up with it all over.
you know.
damn thing, you know,
a person just don't know
from one day to the next
which one's gonna be their last.
well, it's a beautiful
day out there.
feeling a little chill in my bones.
i think it's fixing to rain.
<i>it's probably fixing to rain some.</i>
<i>three african painted dogs...</i>

i thought
maybe you and i
could go out to dinner.
you know?
get all dressed up.
maybe you could...
hold the door open for me.
i think that would be nice.
you pretend to be asleep, but...
i know you'd cry if
i said the wrong thing.
<i>you know this place
is condemned, right?</i>
<i>you can't just take</i>
<i>the boards off windows</i>
<i>and call a place home.</i>
gary, why do you
stick around like this?
you're old enough, smart
enough to do your own thing.
what's most important right now
is me taking care of
dorothy and mama,
'cause... we kind of got a
family problem right now.
<i>hey there.</i>
hey now.
don't talk much, does she?
- she don't talk at all.
- what do you mean?

it's periwinkle blue. i like it.
i hope so.
well, you got plenty
of gas to get home.
you might want to stop at coleman's
and put a little more in it
if you plan to ride around.
- here.
- what's that?
it's the money for the truck.
oh, hell, i ain't worried about that.
you just stick it back in your pocket.
you're gonna need it for insurance.
- what's insurance?
- well, yeah, it's the law.
you can't drive without insurance.
you're covered now, but when i sign it
over, you gotta pick up the insurance.

<i>i'll have his ass shuffling
papers for a while</i>
till he learns to
cool down a little bit.
but that ain't what
i'm worried about.
can you pass the hot sauce?
let me ask you a question, joe,
'cause i really want to know.
why do you want to go back?
why do you want to go back to
the damn penitentiary, man?
<i>'cause you can't keep</i>
<i>going to folks' houses,</i>
<i>killing their dogs, no matter
what else is going on.</i>
and you can't keep
fistfighting the law.
judge won't put up with it.
he don't have to put up with it.
that's why they built prisons.
now you done got me back
to smoking, damn it.
<i>i been quit for three weeks.</i>
i haven't mistreated you, joe.
have i? tell the truth.
no, earl. you stuck up
for me when you could.
and i used to be as bad as you.
at one time, you were worse.
yeah, but i'm cool now.

<i>yo presiento que joe está aqui.</i>

<i>¿estás aqui?</i>

i should have given you
a boxing lesson.
i don't need no
goddamn boxing lesson.
i know what to do. i'll
pop him right in the eye.
he whupped my ass and
threw me out of the truck
'cause he knew that
i were gonna kill him!
i can kill his ass.
i can kill him just
as good as you could.
i know you could, i know you could.
i know it.
but you don't have to do that.

i heard him talking about it.

scarred-up face...

<i>she don't know shit</i>
<i>about shit, man.</i>

and she's gonna be

i'm telling you.
i'm telling you, man.

god damn it!
<i>oh, shit! ah, fuck this shit!</i>
if you want to shoot me,
go ahead and shoot me.
i went through a windshield
and i don't give...
are you my friend?
what have you done, joe?
<i>here's what we do.</i>
<i>we start a little late,
around 8:00 in the morning,</i>
<i>and we go till 4:00.</i>
i pay by the week on fridays.
some days we go long and we
run past 40 hours a week.
i pay time and a half.
it's hard work.
i don't like a whole lot
of standing around.
we'll probably bust our ass
and get this spread out
by the end of april,
get out all
the bare root seedlings,
and sometimes we stake 'em
if we gotta keep
the little ones stable.
most of the time,
we don't need to mess
with them little piney
seedlings like that.
i'm gonna have you join
donnell and his crew
on the west end of the farm.
then, if everything goes
good on that acreage,
i'll have you help me supervise
the monea project next summer.
bastards can be hard
to work for sometimes.
but, hell, if you worked for joe,
i think you'll do just fine.
you got any questions?
no, sir. when can i start?
right now if you're ready.
yes, sir.
- so you knew joe?
- yeah, i sure did.
joe was a good man.
good man to me, anyways.
he was a good man to me, too.
