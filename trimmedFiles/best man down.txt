hi. it's me.
um...
i know you're in arizona for
the wedding, but i really need...
i just wanna talk to you.
okay? so can you please
call me back?
okay, everybody.
let's get on the dance floor
for the minnesota bride and groom,
mr. and mrs. scott thomas.
what do you think?
- this is my best day ever.
- no. best day?
- mm-hmm.
- it's pretty good.
yeah. how about you?
- is it my best day ever?
- yeah.
excluding the bachelor party, right?
- whoa.
- whoa.
of course it was.
i gotta be honest though.
i'm pretty open-minded about
talking about the honeymoon.
- really?
- yeah, i am.
you and me and a bottle of red.
deserted beach in cabo.
- i like the sound of that.
- me too.
let's say good-bye to our closest
who wants a shot, baby?
come on. little tequila
for the bride and groom?
i'm still good
with champagne, lumpy.
yeah, maybe when this dance
is over. okay?
- uh-oh.
- yeah.
- it's over.
- it sure is.
come on. come on.
you gotta celebrate, right?
come on.
you only get married once.
you know, until you turn 40
and you trade in
for the newer, sleeker,
better-looking models.
- i'm kidding.
- he's kidding.
- okay, one time.
- all right!
oh, shit.
i thought you had...
- my dress.
- i'm so sorry.
it's okay. it's okay.
it's not a big deal.
kristin, i'm really sorry.
i didn't...
i thought she was...
kristin insisted on
this destination wedding.
i would have loved
a christmas wedding in minneapolis.
that would have been lovely, too.
but, you know, i told her
that it was gonna cost
everybody a fortune
to fly down to phoenix.
honestly, you can't even tell.
will you button
the little buttons on the back?
be careful.
you don't wanna rip
a $2,000 dress.
it was 3,000.
- does scott know that?
- mm-mmm.
man, i really, really hope
i didn't ruin her dress.
oh, my god.
would you stop it?
and even if you did, when is she
gonna wear the thing again?
- i like the way you think.
- that is good.
- oh.
- hey, man.
thanks again for that loan.
- yeah. sure, sure.
- no, i... i mean it.
that was too much.
well, consider it
a wedding gift, okay?
oh, what are you talking about?
no. i'm paying you back for that.
it was way too much.
no, i'm serious.
i didn't get you a wedding gift.
- take the cash.
- i can't.
- take it.
- well...
- did you just kiss your tie?
- no, i'm...
i've got drool.
- oh, that's charming.
- thank you.
you know the thing is...
i need it.
i'll be honest with you.
it's embarrassing,
but i had no idea
the honeymoon
was gonna cost so much
and rick screwed me so hard
on that commission.
scotty, scotty, scotty.
just stop.
- i love you, man.
- oh, boy.
- i do.
- okay.
yeah, i do.
i wanna touch you.
- oh, come on.
- i wanna get my hands on you.
- okay.
- okay. is it too much?
- that is too much.
- all right. i got carried away.
just man up and drink,
would you?
what is this?
- i'm not even sure what it is.
- oh, my god.
you know, i didn't say anything
when lumpy gargled champagne
during his toast,
or he decided to helicopter
a six-month-old
during the groom's dinner.
he kept referring to himself
as "the baby whisperer."
no. it's not funny.
the kid vomited mashed peas
all over the lobby.
we have to pay for that.
barkeep, another one.
how about a kiss? come on.
all right, i'm up.
all right. all right.
yeah. yeah.
i... i'm all right.
set 'em up!
let's go.
- lumpy, man.
- hey.
- all right. all right.
- yeah.
hey, buddy, i...
why don't you call it a night, man?
- hmm. what? what?
- time to pack it in.
- what?
- yeah.
- you're cutting off...
- dude.
you're cutting off
the best man?
dude, come on.
you threw up in the women's bathroom.
- no, i didn't. did i?
- you did.
- one more drink.
- no, no, no. please. come on.
aw! you're so lame.
you're just...
you're just lame.
no, all right.
y-y-you're lame. you're lame-o.
- all right. i know.
- you're the lamest...
ooh. oh!
you okay?
yes! yeah!
i'm good. yep.
okay.
thanks a lot,
captain lame. captain lame-o.
- is he okay?
- yeah, he's great now.
tomorrow morning
it's gonna be another story.
livin' in a lamish community,
churnin' up that lame butter.
sorry.
look out, everybody!
- shut up in there!
- you shut up!
hmm.
come on. get up.
ramsey, i'm not kidding.
you can't be late again.
get up.
i'm up.
what is your problem?
give me one second.
and don't hassle your mother.
what's going on?
nothing.
i'm going to bed.
i don't know a dave.
david? no.
danny?
my boss's name is danny.
he might be a gemini.
what kind of danger?
hey, um, you're gonna have to
try harder with winston.
- where is he?
- he went back to bed.
oh.
i should go too.
okay.
i'll call you tomorrow.
bye.
ms. shirley?
she says that dan's in danger.
you know, dan from work.
i'm gonna tell him.
you should call her sometime.
by the way,
you never told me where you slept
the other night.
why don't you ask ms. shirley?
god, if you were
with some guy...
i was at a friend's house.
what friend?
hey! aren't you gonna
eat something?
i'm not hungry.
that's it?
sorry. i have to
get my day started.
yeah, me too.
what?
i drove all the way up here
to see you.
couldn't we at least
have breakfast?
hang out a little?
it's a small town.
hey.
maybe i can arrange
a day off next week.
you know what?
forget it.
jesus!
hot date?
what are you doing here?
you know i like to watch.
i hate it when
you pull the blinds, dad.
i'm not your dad.
dad, father, father, dad...
whatever.
i need 50 bucks.
i don't have 50 bucks.
this is really your best option?
blackmailing a priest?
think of it
as community welfare.
isn't there a doctor or a lawyer
you can hustle?
if you want me to go back to
taking it out of the offering tray,
i will.
they just found him
lying there?
yeah. i don't know
what he was doing.
- how...
- i don't know.
a security camera caught him going
out the back door at, like, 1:30.
there's blood
all over his room.
i... i don't know.
hi, honey.
everyone is just devastated.
is there anything that roger and i
could do for you?
no, i don't think so, gail.
thanks though.
well, i don't mean
to upset you,
but this might be
a liability here.
mom, i don't think
that this is a good time.
you know, sweetheart,
you cannot be too careful.
the hotel should
take responsibility.
we could blame the bartenders.
have you two eaten anything yet?
uh, thank you, dad.
we're not hungry.
the resort has a complimentary
continental breakfast.
could you guys go say good-bye
to some of the guests?
- yes, we could, honey.
- that would be really helpful.
all right. yeah.
- i'm sorry.
- wow.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry i don't have a referral
to another provider.
so there's only one company
that can ship a body?
you could keep the deceased
in arizona, have the services here.
no, no, no. the funeral and
the burial have to be in minnesota.
um...
then i guess you're
out of options.
really, mr. huxley?
there's nothing else?
'cause i'm in
a tight spot here.
- oh!
- oh!
oh, god! what the hell
are you doing?
oh. oh, uh... he, um...
jesus christ.
can we go, please?
oh, my god.
there are so many questions
i have for you.
there are so many things i'm
curious about, but you know what?
i think it would be best if we just
never talked about that again.
- okay? ever.
- i think that's fine.
- great.
- great.
let's go back to the hotel, we'll
pack our stuff and call the airline.
see if they can get us on a redeye
back to minneapolis.
what...
minneapolis? no.
- uh, we're going home now?
- yeah.
why?
i assumed that the funeral
would be after the honeymoon.
you... you wanna
postpone the funeral?
who postpones a funeral?
this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
i mean, our honeymoon...
i've been dreaming about it
since i was a little girl.
i'm supposed to be
in a caftan under a palm tree.
what's a caftan?
you don't know
what a caftan is?
i know you never got lumpy.
okay? let's just be honest.
you didn't want him
to be my best man.
i didn't say that.
what i said was,
you two didn't spend
much time together anymore.
what does that mean?
we're men.
men don't spend
a lot of time together.
we have to go home
because i have to take care
of my friend's
funeral arrangement, okay?
i can't believe this happened
on our wedding night.
hey, will you hold this?
it's lumpy's.
then we can make some calls,
just let people know what happened.
there are only six numbers stored.
two of them
are for pizza delivery.
it's not a joke.
it's true.
- who's ramsey anderson?
- no idea.
probably a friend from law school
or the restaurant maybe.
so, after the autopsy they're gonna
ship the body back to minnesota
- by budget courier.
- budget courier?
- is that a normal thing?
- i don't know.
i've, weirdly, never had to ship
a friend's body anywhere before.
it's still gonna be $2,000.
we don't have it.
not after the open bar and
the welcome baskets for the guests.
and a $2,000 dress.
- so, it wasn't worth it?
- come on, i didn't say that.
we're gonna have to use the honeymoon
money for the funeral though.
what choice do i have, kristin?
he was my best man.
hi.
aren't you supposed
to be in school?
someone's gotta shop for food.
yeah. well, you don't have a job.
neither do you.
why you gotta be like that?
i'm trying to make things work,
you know?
i thought we had a deal here.
i don't like that deal.
i didn't ask if you liked it.
hey. i'm not finished.
i'm not finished.
this is your family, ramsey.
whether you like it or not,
we're family.
you're welcome?
can we just go?
- i have to tell your mother.
- no!
i know what i promised, but i
could get in serious trouble here.
it was just cold medicine.
you don't look
like you have a cold.
you're lucky i was able
to talk the sheriff
into releasing you into my custody.
yeah, really lucky.
ramsey.
ramsey, wait.
ramsey.
look, it's seriously decent of you
to spring me from my incarceration.
but i'm fine, okay?
i know why people buy cold medicine.
it's to make crystal meth.
why'd you steal it anyway?
i just gave you money.
- i spent it.
- on drugs?
don't you have candles to light,
or, like, wine and crackers
to hand out?
that's what you think i do?
mood lighting and catering?
i don't do drugs, okay?
you only have
a couple of more months of this.
don't blow it!
welcome aboard
valdez flight 896,
redeye to minneapolis, minnesota.
it's gonna be a full flight tonight,
folks, so we ask you
to find your seat and stow
your luggage as quickly as possible
for an on-time departure.
- oh, my god.
- what? what's wrong?
i think i packed the ambien
in my suitcase.
- okay, are...
- i can't believe this.
- are you sure?
- oh, my god.
well, look...
look in that guy.
jesus.
kris, it's only
a four-hour flight.
but i need to sleep.
i need a xanax.
jesus. how many pills
are you taking?
my god.
you're like a pharmacy in there.
these ones are the white ones,
not the orange ones.
they're like half as strong.
and the blue ones, those are the ones
that are for crazies.
okay, elvis, when did chronic
anxiety take over your life?
am i missing something?
why are... you're like announcing this
to the entire plane.
oh, relax. he's the one guy
that's eavesdropping.
we don't even know him.
who cares?
hi.
i'm neil.
your mom's cousin's son?
we met at the reception.
- right.
- hi, neil.
- i'm really sorry about your friend.
- thank you, neil.
i don't have anxiety issues.
- oh, i wasn't even paying attention.
- he wasn't listening.
i have a slight fear of flying.
xanax helps take the edge off
during takeoff.
- okay.
- but don't need 'em.
not like i'm addicted.
kris, he doesn't care.
how are you at flying?
do you want one?
they're the white ones.
they're not the orange ones.
no. thank you though.
i appreciate that.
um, gosh, you know,
that is a "d" on my ticket,
which means i have the wrong seat.
so i'm gonna scooch on over.
rick going to be
at the funeral?
oh, well, yeah, probably.
we've both known lumpy
since junior high, so guessing.
such a real estate crook.
yeah, and his dad's my boss,
so please remember that, kris.
i thought you didn't have to
pay a referral fee
if it was within the office.
you do sometimes.
it depends.
he fails.
ethan risks everything to be with
the woman that he loves,
but he fails.
why?
why would wharton
have ethan and mattie fail?
anna? what do you think?
i didn't read it.
did anybody read it?
no. see, that's the thing
about literature...
you have to read it.
okay. for tomorrow...
i want everyone
to finish ethan frome.
- lunch?
- sure.
i was talking to her.
all i'm saying is
that i can't think of a time
when lumpy wasn't either drunk
or naked or both.
yeah, everyone lets loose
on vacation.
clearly you've forgotten the hairy
bead rack incident on bourbon st.
oh, yeah.
i mean, new orleans was struggling
through a post-katrina holocaust,
and lumpy thinks he can
brighten everyone's day
by hanging beads from...
what did he call it?
his hairy button.
- hairy button.
- that was hilarious.
- oh, scott.
- okay, listen. you know what?
i agree, in the last year the
drinking got a little out of control.
but i don't know
what you want me to say, kris.
i mean, he was my best friend.
but he wasn't your best friend.
he was your oldest friend.
there's a difference.
i don't care what you call him.
i knew lumpy
better than anyone.
i'm very sorry for your loss,
but lawrence is no longer
a law student here.
what? n... no.
that must be a mistake.
well, he hasn't been enrolled
for almost a year.
a year?
did he transfer
to another school?
i don't have any record
of a transcript request.
he flunked out of law school?
actually, his grades
were quite strong.
- he left for personal reasons.
- what does that mean?
i... i'm sorry. i don't have
any further information.
but i'd be happy to put his funeral
announcement on our website.
uh, thank you... actually, could you
search for one more student for us?
it's a friend of lumpy's.
- lumpy?
- lawrence. sorry.
of course.
uh, what's the name?
- uh, ra...
- ramsey anderson.
i'll check.
sorry. lots of andersons.
no ramsey.
yeah. this is it.
- hi.
- hi.
- two?
- no, we're actually not here to eat.
um, we're friends of lumpy's.
last time i saw lumps
we were totally wasted,
and we ended up...
n-never mind.
how old are you?
i'm afraid we have
some really bad news.
uh, l-lumpy passed away
- over the weekend.
- what?
it was an accident. it was
a very unfortunate accident.
we just wanted
to tell his manager
and let everyone know
about the funeral.
oh, my god. he o.d.'d.
no. no, no, no.
why would you think he o.d.'d?
he died on a cactus.
can you tell your manager
that we're here
to talk to him or her?
uh, sure. lumpy hasn't worked here
in a couple of months though.
he hasn't?
no, he was...
he was fired.
what?
how could he fire lumpy?
lumpy loved this job.
- is he in there?
- you can't go in there!
scott, don't do that.
i swear to god.
bruce doesn't like
to be interrupted.
oh, eureka.
- what?
- oh. god, sorry.
- um...
- you can't just barge in here.
i just wanted to talk to you,
but i-i'll wait outside.
i think he needs a minute.
he was stealing?
uh, we caught him on camera.
no. there's no way.
not lumpy.
look, bartending
is a cash business.
it happens, you know.
sooner or later, temptation wins out.
did you call the police? is there
a report that was filed or something?
the owners wanted to,
but i never did.
- why?
- i think he was in a bad place.
what do you mean?
there was a lot of booze
and, uh,
some girl up north
in, uh, lutsen.
do you remember her name,
by any chance?
oh, man. uh...
was it ramsey?
it... maybe. yeah.
that sounds right.
okay. thank you for your time.
and sorry about barging in again.
i'm real sorry
about your friend.
- everyone liked lumpy.
- yeah.
- good luck.
- thank you.
don't touch it!
thank you.
hey.
aren't you going to work?
i called dan.
i told him i wasn't feeling well.
- is he okay?
- hmm?
wasn't he in danger?
you don't believe
in ms. shirley, do you?
she's from
thief river falls, mom.
it is a gift.
she has a real gift.
yeah.
for taking your money.
the first time i talked to her,
she knew everything about me.
names.
she knew names.
have you ever heard
of caller i.d. and google?
- hey, baby.
- hey.
can i talk to you?
did you get it?
tried.
what happened?
one of the security thingies went off
and i got busted for shoplifting.
but i told you to take
the security tags off.
i did.
must have missed one.
it's okay.
did you, uh...
did you say anything about me?
- no.
- you sure? you sure?
'cause you can tell me.
just tell me.
i didn't.
ramsey, we need this money.
your mom won't ask, but we need it.
how bad does she need it?
i told you, it ain't for us.
look at me.
i come back from two back-to-back
tours in iraq last year,
and i got shit.
no job, no degree,
no money... nothin'.
all i have is respect,
and from you i'm gonna get respect.
i asked you to do one thing,
one stupid little thing...
and you messed it up.
what's this?
where'd you get this?
- a friend.
- nice friend?
yeah.
i wonder what you have to do for
a friend to get a phone like this.
don't mess up again.
your call has been forwarded
to an automatic
voice-message system.
six-1-2-8-4-5-4.
would anyone like some more wine?
- yeah.
- i would.
your uncle and i are very happy
to have a belated christmas dinner
with the newlyweds.
we're all glad you're here.
too bad your brother had to fly
straight back to wilmington
from phoenix.
helen, you should see
the house he bought.
oh, john's work
is just going so well.
his company
is exploiting chinese children
into making automotive paint.
here we go
with all the green talk again.
we are proud of you too,
being a teacher.
why would...
that's not what i'm...
could somebody
please pass the mrs. dash?
she might be hiding
with mr. dash.
oh, we don't know if there
is a mr. dash, dad.
maybe things didn't go well
after their wedding or something.
well, maybe mr. dash
had some things on his mind,
and things he had
to take care of.
i just wonder if mr. and mrs. dash
didn't go on a honeymoon
and then after that
stopped communicating.
maybe mrs. dash should stop
feeling sorry for herself.
i think that mrs. dash
is trying really hard
- and maybe feels underappreciated.
- maybe mrs. dash should remember
she's not the only spice
in the spice rack.
i'm not saying that mrs. dash
is the only spice.
mrs. dash has gotten very arrogant
lately. little one-sided.
- arrogant?
- mm-hmm.
there's paprika, there's thyme,
there's rosem... lot of other spices.
i think maybe it's time
to clear the table.
- i'll help you.
- no, no, helen. now, you sit.
i only get to wash
the christmas dishes once a year.
okay, this is it.
we couldn't believe all those
strange-looking plants in phoenix.
what were they called again?
cactus, helen.
they were cactus.
they weren't cactus.
i know what cactus look like.
they're succulents.
too bad about your...
your friend, scott.
yeah. i'm sorry.
that's too bad.
it was an unfortunate lesson
for all of us.
boy looked like
he was a lot of fun.
he was a lot of fun, roger.
he wasn't a boy though.
- he was a man.
- of course he was a man.
no, no, no.
he was a real man.
just because he drank
a little too much
and quit law school
and he got fired from his job,
it doesn't make him less of a man.
'cause he was a man, kris.
okay. we understand
and we know you're upset...
you asked me to pee
sitting down!
i thought it would be
a nice compromise.
you wanted me to carry a purse,
for christ's sake.
- why would he carry a purse?
- it was a man bag!
and i was only pointing out that
some men have found it efficient.
- they are in europe, mostly...
- we don't live in europe.
this is what i'm talking about.
lumpy kept it real.
he was a man.
i'm going to help mom
in the kitchen.
good idea.
come on, terry. this isn't even
gonna get me through new years.
man, terry! hey.
what?
nothing.
your aunt had to bring up lumpy.
mom, someone died.
people are gonna talk about it.
but that's all they talk about.
oh, your best man got drunk
and died at the wedding.
do you know that he hit
on your cousin lindsay?
she's 14.
they were just dancing.
i think it's inappropriate.
i don't like it.
well, don't tell me
that you don't wish
that it didn't happen
on your wedding night.
actually, i just wish
that it didn't happen.
- oh. hey.
- i'm sorry. you're not a smoker.
should we leave tomorrow morning
after traffic?
- leave for where?
- lutsen.
what are you talking about?
why would we drive to lutsen?
'cause we have to
find ramsey anderson
and tell her that
her boyfriend died.
kris, that's like five hours away.
it's near canada.
why don't we just
call ramsey anderson?
i tried. the phone's
been disconnected or something.
i googled. i facebooked.
there's nothing.
what about a home number?
do you know how many andersons
there are in northern minnesota?
so we're gonna drive to lutsen
and just ask around
for ramsey anderson?
- yeah.
- why would we do that?
because lumpy
was your best friend.
kris, can you take
your legs down, please?
'cause we get in an accident,
you're gonna get paralyzed.
but we've passed, like, two cars
in the last 20 minutes.
can you just work with me, please?
come on.
we're newlyweds.
thank you.
i need to pee again.
really?
yeah.
mom.
there's someone at the door.
mom!
- hey.
- hi.
hi. uh, i'm sorry
to bother you.
are your parents at home?
yeah.
great.
can i talk to them?
why?
okay.
uh, yeah, because i normally
cut through your neighbor's property
to get down to the lake,
but they have it plowed so...
yeah, i think they took their
winnebago to florida for the winter.
do you think it would be okay
if i just cut through
your property really quick?
- yeah. sure.
- really?
- rock it out.
- all right. rock it out.
you like these guys, huh?
you know these guys?
yeah, i do.
a lot of people do.
not in this town.
oh, no, maybe not.
yeah. probably right.
okay, i'll get out of your hair.
thank you.
careful on the ice.
global warming.
thanks.
who was that at the door?
- who was that?
- some guy.
- what guy?
- i don't know. he's gone.
have you seen my cigarettes?
finished the pack at school.
don't be a smart-ass.
so, uh, how was school anyway?
i asked you a question.
what are you doing?
- i asked you how school was.
- how do you think it was? it sucks.
- why?
- why do you think?
i don't know, ramsey.
that's why i'm asking.
i hate it here.
you never gave it a chance.
no one makes new friends
in high school.
oh, you're so smart though.
yeah, and everyone's
just dying to be friends
with that freak girl who does math
two years ahead of everybody else.
well, if you try,
it'll get better.
you sure about that, mom?
is it gonna get better
like milwaukee,
where i got beat up every week?
or is it gonna get better
like rockford,
where you got beat up every week?
stop it.
i did the best that i could.
or is it like brooklyn park,
where i had to watch my dad o.d.
- stop it!
- so tell me, mom,
when does it get better,
because i wouldn't want to miss it.
ramsey.
- where are you going?
- anywhere but here.
- hey.
- hey.
sorry. i didn't mean
to scare you.
you didn't.
good.
- how's it going?
- good.
just, uh, you know,
gettin' started.
i just wanted to make sure
you found it.
the lake?
yeah.
yeah. found it.
it's right there.
cool.
- see ya.
- see ya.
oh.
oh, yeah. okay.
oh... oh!
oh!
oh, look at you!
ohh! oh!
oh.
oh, shit.
oh, shit.
oh, god!
help! help!
hold on!
come on!
you're almost there!
i told you.
global warming.
oh, shit.
it's a wintry mess here...
i still think you should've
gone to the hospital.
mm-mmm. no, no.
no, duluth is, like,
two hours away from here.
i took a hot shower.
i'll be fine.
well, you look purple
and bloated.
i always look bloated.
it's okay, it's okay.
i work really hard
to look this bloated.
it's a point of pride for me.
good evening.
i'm michelle lee.
mother nature is once again
trying to put a damper on...
do you mind if i shower?
- you want to take a shower here?
- i was on the ice too.
- remember?
- i do. i do. yeah. yeah.
uh, yeah.
knock yourself out.
um...
i think i should probably take you
home after that though. okay?
are you sure?
uh, what would, uh...
what would your family say
if they saw you here with me?
we're not doing anything wrong.
i just think that it would
probably be the right choice.
okay?
like it was the right choice
for me to risk my life
saving a total stranger?
i thanked you for that, like,
a hundred times. didn't i? i mean...
i just, uh...
you want me to get out of here
'cause you got what you needed.
- what?
- that's real fuckin' nice.
hey, you don't even know me, okay?
a-and watch your mouth,
young lady.
i know you. i know men.
you want money.
you want sex. you want drugs.
whoa... what?
wh-what are you talking... hold on.
i was just simply saying that
i think maybe you should...
get the hell out of here!
i heard you.
maybe if i get home in time, i can
still score some pharmaceuticals
for my mom's boyfriend
and we can all do some meth together
and watch cartoons.
from the direction
of eau claire city...
hey, stop! stop!
hey, hey, hey!
god bless america!
stop!
- you're gonna get pneumonia.
- i-i-i'm really sorry.
i'm really, really sorry.
i didn't mean it like that.
okay? genuinely.
all right, listen. just, uh,
you know, come back inside.
let me at least put some clothes on
and i will drive you home.
i can walk.
get your butt back in the hotel
room, or i'm gonna drop this towel!
you'll be scarred for life.
good choice.
smart choice. oh!
let me in.
now, the state patrol, as well as
local law enforcement agencies,
are stepping up their...
and, uh, you know,
i was gonna be a big-shot lawyer.
i was gonna be,
you know, rich, have a...
a house on the lake,
and a different car for the winter,
a different one for the summer.
but everything just... fell apart.
rough.
yeah.
anyway, uh...
so, you, uh... you guys
just moved here, yeah?
me and my mom move around a lot.
i'm gettin' out of here though.
you are? on your own?
i'm filing for emancipation
this summer.
- i'm gonna get my g.e.d., and...
- whoa.
i got a 1990
on my s.a.t.'s.
no, you didn't.
they only go up to 1600.
they changed it.
they changed it.
nobody ever tells me anything.
so, um...
what college you gonna go to?
- i don't know.
- you don't know?
you gotta go to college.
it's sort of expensive.
yeah.
- open up. cook county sheriff.
- what? no. no way.
- oh, my god. put your shoes on.
- wait...
- ho! whoa!
- on the floor.
okay, okay. okay.
okay.
we should stop and ask.
this is why we should have gotten
a g.p.s. take you right there.
hey.
"lutsen, 25 miles."
all right.
yeah?
- hi. miss anderson?
- maybe.
i'm scott thomas.
this is my wife kristin.
we're friends of lumpy's.
hi.
w-we have bad news, i'm afraid.
who's lumpy?
aren't you ramsey anderson?
no, that's my daughter.
your daughter?
- is she home?
- how old is your daughter?
um, look, i don't know
who you people are, but...
- you're friends of lumpy's?
- who is lumpy?
mom, it's cool.
you know these people?
sort of, yes.
fine.
i gotta go to work.
i'm sorry about that.
she's tired.
- you guys can come in.
- thanks.
um...
i'm afraid we have
some bad news, ramsey.
lumpy passed away this week.
there was an accident
at our wedding, and it was...
it was very sudden for everyone.
so we wanted to tell you.
what happened?
well, he, uh...
he fell in the desert.
he fell and he hit his head.
and he... he died.
we don't know what, exactly,
your relationship was with lumpy.
it's none of our business, so...
no, but we want you to know
that you can talk to us.
i should probably get going
actually, if that's cool.
- oh.
- sorry.
okay.
well, would you like the details
for the funeral service?
'cause it's gonna be monday
in minneapolis and...
that's okay.
- okay.
- okay.
okay.
um...
sorry you guys had to
drive all the way up here.
i'm just glad we were able
to tell you.
nice to meet you.
- what was that?
- i don't know.
she acted like
she didn't even know him.
they're gone?
yeah. it was just
a misunderstanding.
danny gets all bent out of shape
if i'm five minutes late.
if you see winston,
tell him i'll be off at 1:00.
is everything all right?
yeah, i'm fine.
smile.
hmm?
you never smile.
can't we just
drive back tonight?
oh, come on.
please, no.
it's so cold.
i'm tired.
let's just order a pizza
and crash here.
it just seems like
a waste of money.
waste of money?
it's, like, 39 bucks a night.
think we can still swing that.
mmm.
what are you doing?
i'm gonna check for bedbugs.
um...
i quit my job.
- what?
- yeah.
quit. done.
quit my job.
rick wouldn't give me
the commission yet again,
so i finally called his dad...
please tell me
that you're joking.
nope.
and, uh, rick senior tells me
that i'm not a team player.
you quit your job now?
why are you saying it like that?
you're the one
that said they were crooks.
yeah, they are, but i didn't
say "quit your job."
we have a wedding to pay for!
well, you're the one
that bought a $2,000 dress.
it was 3,000.
oh, jesus, kris.
- oh, my god.
- you have to get your job back.
i can't get my job back!
i don't want to get my job back!
keep shafting me
on commissions, and i'm done.
that's what lumpy
would have done.
oh, well, by all means
let's follow lumpy's example.
what has he done?
he dropped out of law school.
he got fired for embezzlement.
now i think he's committed
statutory rape!
stop it! please don't.
just don't.
you know how we could
afford mexico?
lumpy gave me the money.
he got us a honeymoon,
and i can't even
get his funeral right.
you never told me that.
he asked me not to tell you.
- wh-where are you going?
- i'm gonna find us some food.
i don't care.
get away!
stop!
ow. ow!
my hand's burning.
ow!
what'd you do? oh!
ramsey. no.
not in front of her, no.
i'm... hey!
it's okay, baby.
- not in front of my little girl!
- calm down.
why... get out of here!
get out!
i don't want her
to see. i don't want her to see.
it's all right.
where'd you get muffins in lutsen?
they're just hostess cupcakes.
well, it's still
a pretty good effort.
i'm sorry. i am so sorry
about the honeymoon and the job.
no. no.
i should be apologizing to you.
you did the right thing.
i promise you
we're gonna have a honeymoon.
we're gonna have a...
a great honeymoon.
i know.
i need a ride.
to the funeral.
can i go with you guys?
uh, sure.
yeah, we can drive you
to minneapolis.
but how you gonna get back home?
i don't know.
i'd take the bus or something?
i think we should
figure that out before...
- yeah...
- i'm pregnant.
it's lumpy's.
i knew it.
i have to go to the funeral.
lumpy would have wanted me...
i mean, us to be there.
- why can't we just leave?
- because that would be kidnapping.
- so we're gonna ask your mom.
- remember our deal.
yeah, i won't say anything about
the pregnancy to your mom.
and i won't mention it
at the funeral.
perfect.
- mom.
- hi again.
- they shouldn't be here.
- mom, it's okay.
we just came to ask if we could
take ramsey to minneapolis.
- what's he talking about?
- it's for the funeral.
no one is taking
my daughter anywhere.
it's for lumpy.
i don't care what it's for.
i don't even know you.
we're friends of...
friends of a mutual friend, lumpy.
yeah? lumpy?
you were going, uh...
going off with some lumpy guy?
- where did you find those?
- doesn't matter.
you went through my room
and dug through my stuff.
i'm your mother! i can go through
what the... the hell i want to!
who'd you bring in this house?
this about last night?
no, listen,
everything's totally cool.
we just came here to ask you guys
if we could take ramsey
to a funeral for our friend lumpy.
who?
- let's just... we should go.
- no. i'm coming with you.
yeah, listen. i'm just trying
to respect the wishes
- of a friend who passed away.
- i don't care what you're doing.
- get the hell out of here.
- whoa! whoa! whoa!
- we gotta go.
- baby, what are you doing?
social services.
that what this is?
no! oh, no, no, no.
he's in real estate.
i'm a third grade teacher.
yeah.
wh-where did you get that?
i promise you, there's no reason
for that, okay? e-everything's fine.
we just... we have a mutual friend
who passed away.
we're just going to a funeral.
that's it.
- i told you to leave!
- okay.
okay. we'll go.
baby, it's okay.
maybe they're right. maybe ramsey
should go to the funeral.
ms. shirley said that it was okay.
- ms. shirley?
- yeah.
she said that maybe it's a good time
for you to start traveling.
you know, seeing other pl...
hold on.
- how long you gonna be gone?
- i don't know.
um, the funeral is tomorrow,
so we can put her on a bus
by monday night, tuesday morning.
here.
i want you to have it.
i want you to know we're gonna
take really good care of her.
it's only for a couple days.
we'll have her back.
- make sure.
- yeah, we will.
- we should go.
- okay.
i'm sorry again about
all the confusion and, um...
i-i-i didn't catch your name.
um, you know what?
i-i'm just gonna leave you
a business card there.
that's me and my cell number, if you
need to get in touch, check in.
okay.
i love you.
jesus.
it's only gonna be two days.
s-so, how often would lumpy
come and visit you, ramsey?
almost every weekend.
really?
and, um, your mom
never met him?
we hung out
at the motel mostly.
huh.
so, you guys just got married
four days ago?
- mmm.
- yeah.
aren't you supposed to be
on your honeymoon or something?
mmm.
yeah, supposed to be...
lying under a palm tree
in a caftan, sipping a mojito.
what's a caftan?
never mind.
so...
no honeymoon.
- nope.
- hmm.
waste of a perfectly good
boob job.
you got a boob job?
- no, i did not, ramsey.
- i was just kidding.
i didn't think so.
i need a xanax.
- again?
- what do you mean? "again"?
what do you mean, "again"?
- you took one earlier.
- yeah.
- did i?
- you did.
my mom says taking drugs
for fun is okay,
but taking them for problems is not.
'cause once the drugs wear off,
you still have the problem.
yeah.
why'd you quit your job?
wh... huh?
why'd i qui...
oh.
it's a long story, ramsey.
hmm.
we got two hours
till minneapolis.
yeah.
pop'll kill you.
we have green tea.
ever had goji berries?
oh.
well, they're filled
with antioxidants.
well, i'm 15.
i don't need antioxidants.
that's lumpy's
ultimate fighting phase.
- lumpy fought?
- mmm.
only with jim beam.
hey, is this picture
from the wisconsin dells truck?
yeah.
how'd you know that?
he talked about you guys
all the time.
- what's wrong?
- that was the coroner.
uh, apparently lumpy
didn't bleed to death.
- he had a heart failure.
- what?
yeah. it had nothing
to do with the cactus.
- he had a heart attack?
- he had a heart attack.
the coroner said
it was like, um,
you know, when young athletes
just collapse on the field.
did you know that lumpy
had a heart condition?
i don't think lumpy knew
he had a heart condition.
he knew.
he knew about his heart.
he had i.h.s.s.
how do you know?
he told me.
what's i.h.s.s.?
uh, idiopathic hyper...
something-something.
it's pretty rare, probably genetic.
so lumpy told you
he had a heart defect?
i just said that.
what else did he tell you?
- lots of things.
- yeah? like what?
- like, why do you care?
- i-i-i'll tell you why.
because i don't know what he's doing,
where he's working, who he's dating.
i don't really know anything
about the guy, as it turns out.
- neither do i.
- oh, n...
i think you knew him
pretty well, actually.
did lumpy know about the baby?
- scott...
- no, no, no. did he?
- did lumpy know about the baby?
- i don't know!
you don't know if you told your
own boyfriend you were pregnant?
i mean, what the hell?
what if she got pregnant on purpose?
she's just a girl.
what if that made
his heart thing worse?
- it doesn't matter.
- of course it matters!
- what are you talking about?
- he's gone, scott.
i know that. i just...
he told a 15-year-old girl
he was dying. he didn't tell me.
i just wish he'd told me.
oh, i wish he had told me.
you told me you would never
involve her in the drugs.
you promised.
we all make our sacrifices.
yeah.
you know what i think?
i think she got caught on purpose.
and i'm gonna have a little talk
with her when she gets back.
- scott.
- hi, gail.
i am so sorry.
so sorry.
- he was just way too young.
- he was.
- hey, roger.
- hi, scott.
uh, i gotta...
so, don't you look pretty.
i like your hair like that.
- have you taken any pills today?
- what?
well, your father and i
are very worried about you and drugs.
oh, my god.
- honey, we love you very much.
- yes, we do.
my god.
this is about neil on the plane?
yes, neil did say something to his
mother, and he's only trying to help.
this is so ridiculous.
i thank the lord
that he did say something.
because otherwise i wouldn't know
that you have a problem.
- i don't have a problem!
- honey, a-all right.
- don't get excited.
- we're gonna talk about this later.
- yeah, that's good.
- that's right.
- we'll talk about it later.
- please go sit down.
- just no drugs today.
-  mother!
honey.
what is going on?
i... i can't talk about it.
i'm gonna go to the bathroom.
okay.
my name is ramsey anderson.
i know a lot of you probably don't
know who i am or how i knew lumpy.
oh, god.
it's sort of a long story.
lumpy had a minor heart attack
a year and a half ago.
and the doctors told him
there was no way to know for sure,
but they didn't think he would live
more than a year or two.
he had i.h.s.s.
it's a heart defect,
which means the walls of his heart
were hard and thick.
and knowing lumpy,
that's difficult for me to believe.
he didn't tell anyone
about his heart
because he didn't want
his friends or family to worry.
and if he only had
a little time left to live,
the last thing he wanted to be
was a lawyer.
he just wanted to fish
and have fun.
but then he met me.
what's this?
my last rites already?
we're dropping the charges.
the girl told us what happened.
we went out to the lake,
saw where you fell through.
you're lucky.
lumpy started visiting me,
um, twice a month,
and then every week.
and he'd come up and i'd do
my homework in his motel room,
or we'd go fishing.
it was fun.
it was always fun with lumpy.
i know this sounds weird,
but he was the first real friend
i ever had.
but when things got worse
for me at home,
he decided he had to do something.
so you want ramsey
to move to minneapolis with you?
yeah. why not?
she could start at the "u"
a year early.
she aced her s.a.t.,
and she gets good grades.
she's also 15 years old.
yeah. and you know
what's going on inside that house.
she's gotta get out.
you might be right,
but you're not her parent.
then help us convince her mother
that it's the best thing for ramsey.
what if something happens to you?
nothing's gonna happen to me.
you sure this is what you want?
yeah.
i want to leave.
but we never got to
that part of the plan.
there are a lot of moments in life,
and i didn't know lumpy
very long.
most of you probably had more time
with him than i did,
but just because dying on a cactus
was lumpy's last moment
doesn't mean it was
his most important one.
i loved my friend
and the moments we had.
i loved lumpy.
that was really good,
what you said in there.
and i know lumpy
would have liked it.
when i yelled at you yesterday,
that wasn't about you.
but i had no right to do that,
and i'm... i'm very sorry.
i've been yelled at
a lot worse.
that doesn't really
make me feel better.
i'm not pregnant.
yeah, i kinda figured that out.
lumpy was a great guy.
he never would have...
i know. i know.
what's he doing here?
rick?
you know rick?
that's rick?
rick the realtor rick?
the one that took your commission?
yeah. but...
- hey, what are you doing?
- i'll be right back.
hey.
- hey.
- hey.
can i talk to you
about a friend of mine?
he's like a father to me.
jaime!
i had to wait
jaime?
i wanted to tell you
i'm really sorry about your son.
thank you.
i have something for you.
when i went to
lumpy's apartment,
i found this with your name on it.
this is your money.
it's an advance to help
with your transition to minneapolis.
i put the rest
in a safe deposit box.
why are you doing this?
if lumpy wanted you to start college
early, that's what you should do.
you'll probably have to get
a part-time job,
but that should go a long way
towards tuition.
i don't know what to say.
you know, i always felt bad
my son never met anyone to love,
someone to love him back.
it's really good to know
that i was wrong.
- hon.
- oh.
what is this?
looks like a wedding gift?
i don't know.
just came today.
open it.
"knew you always wanted one of these.
love, lumpy."
it's a robe.
he knew you always wanted a robe?
it's not a robe.
- looks like a robe.
- what is it?
it's a caftan.
it's... it's a caftan.
- is she okay?
- yeah, she's good.
uh, i guess i should
find my way home.
is there a bus station
around here somewhere?
uh, your mom
called this morning.
she did?
yeah. she left lutsen.
she's left a lot of towns.
you know, i...
i-i honestly think
this is good for her.
i-i think it's good for you too.
anyway, i know
she wants to get help.
where is she?
i don't know.
we're gonna figure this out.
- where am i supposed to go?
- you stay here for now.
- with you?
- yeah.
you guys just got married.
you don't want me here.
we talked about it, okay?
stay here.
- for how long?
- for as long as it takes.
lumpy had good taste in friends.
besides, i think i owe you one.
i don't know what you said to rick.
- nothing.
- nothing?
"nothing" got me my job back?
i just promised
i'd help him out with something.
oh, god. what?
you know what?
i don't want to know, do i?
- probably not.
-  okay.
well, we'll table it.
- you hungry?
- starving.
come on.
- hello.
- hi.
