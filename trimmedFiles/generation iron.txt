i'm fragile.
i feel pain, i hurt.
i open my eyes.
i create.
i conquer.
i hold power.
i'm a thinker.
i crave victory.
i do not give up.
i feel no fear.
i fear no man.
i'm an athlete, a warrior.
an artist.
if it was easy, everybody
would be good at it.
i was told that long
time ago by a coach.
if you want something
you never had before,
you gotta be willing
to do something
you've never done before.
that's what i live by.
i want to be two-time mr. olympia.
i have to be willing
to do whatever it takes.
you know, the record is
eight mr. olympia titles
held by lee haney
and ronnie colman.
arnold schwarzenegger won seven,
jay cutler won four.
i think for me it's just, i'm
already the best at what i do.
i had to ask myself a serious
question, which was, can i get better
than what i just did?
and it was like, the next
day at a photo shoot, i knew.
i don't like the way
i look right there.
people would say, "are you
crazy? you just beat everybody!
you won with a perfect score."
but in my heart,
i knew, i was like,
"phil, this is just the beginning."
your legacy is not gonna to be
dictated on winning one olympia,
it's going to be
dictated on how many.
for all bodybuilders,
the experience is similar.
they are an oddity,
stares, pointed fingers.
they're in a freak show
with no circus tent
to hide away in.
for the 32-year-old
champ, it's an honor,
an honor that fuels his
drive to secure position
as the greatest
bodybuilder of his day,
to prove that his win was no fluke.
- all right, take care.
- thank you!
there's a lot of people out there
wondering, "can he do it again?"
so it's my job to remind them
and the world that
i am the champion.
and i'm gonna be here for awhile.

phil heath!
bodybuilding falls into
this unique category
of, you know, being a sport,
being entertainment,
being a way of life,
and being also art.
so you have to really have a sense
of a sculptor to really
sculpt, to mold your body.
the only difference is
that we in bodybuilding
use a certain machine to
train the front deltoid,
if it's missing, or a
certain machines to train
the serratus or the intercostals,
and an artist or a sculptor
uses a chisel and a hammer.
but it's all about what
is your vision about
the way you should look
like as a finished product
and how do you get it there.
you're trying to take your body
and sculpt it to where
everything is in proportion,
everything from right side
to the left side is equal,
and just being a true work of art.
i think the main motivation for me
with this whole
bodybuilding experience is
knowing that there's no such
thing as "the perfect body."
but i'm gonna chase
it as hard as i can.
joe weider was really
the father of fitness.
he created the mr. olympia
contest, and created
the international
federation of bodybuilders,
and the mr. olympia became
the super bowl of bodybuilding.
what does it mean
to be mr. olympia?
it means to be the
best of the best.
a great champion
is a lot of things.
you have to be a role
model to a lot of people.
you have to carry yourself as
a professional all the time.
you have to go in and have
to train at 100 percent.
you have to go to bed
every night and say,
"am i fulfilling the task
of being the best at what i do?"
like in any sport,
you can win it and
relax a little bit,
or you can win it and stay hungry.
do you really want to, you
know, win it more that once?
but there's never a guarantee.
it comes down to the mind,
the will, the determination,
the discipline and the motivation.
and you have that fierce drive
that nothing's gonna stop you.
that's what makes you a champion.
when you are a champion, you
never think you're gonna lose.
this is you life,
and this is your job.
this is your number-one
responsibility,
your number-one priority in life.
all you gotta do is continue
to do what you done before.
let them follow you.
you don't have to follow them.
so, if i try to change
up my training system...
why?
why would i change?
i am who i am.
they are who they are.
they may try to change
to do what i'm doing,
because i have
proven that it worked.
i'm the leader, i'm the man.
not you, me, and it's
okay, because i look good.
i think that phil has the look,
the physique, the mindset.
i think he has the fire in
the belly to be a champion,
which is something he wants to
do for the next several years.
so i think we'll have
the next ronnie coleman.
phil heath, also
known as "the gift,"
is the image of confidence.
the olympia competition
is still weeks away.
some of his contenders
have yet to qualify,
yet he has no qualms about
having a suit tailored
for his victory.
i'm not gonna lie, i
mean, i kinda like knowing
that when i win,
not only i outshine them on stage,
but then off stage.
because i know that
i'm covering every angle
to be better than them.
if i go out on the
town with the missus,
or if i'm going out with the guys,
i'm wearing
button-downs, you know,
i'm wearing the same stuff,
the guy would be like,
"how did you fit in that?"
i say, "well i got a tailor, bro."
there are always
contenders waiting to rise.
waiting for the perfect moment
to take advantage of a misstep...
an unseen weakness.
this is kai greene, his nemesis,
his enemy, studying every pose.
he has 11 weeks to prepare.
for me, winning the olympia
is a celebration
for a lot of people
that at least can share in the idea
that well, you know,
maybe i wasn't born
with the best genetics,
or maybe i wasn't born
with the most dashing good looks,
but there's something
to be said for hard work.
so, you know, we can
say, "keep your gifts."
i work hard.
i know how to work real hard.
even if i tear a bicep,
i'm still gonna stay
on my discipline.
look at me from every angle,
and you're not gonna
see one piece of my body
that's undeveloped.
i'm gonna develop
symmetry, conditioning,
and i am going to
whup the ass of anyone
that stands there believing
that all it takes is genetics.
hard work beats
talent all the time.
well, that's what he's thinking.
he thinks that hard work
is gonna beat talent.
when talent actually
works hard, it's over.
there's nothing that that
other person can do about it.
that confidence has led
phil to achieve a greatness
few can dream of.
but pride and arrogance
have been the downfall
of many great men.
kai never had a family.
his mother abandoned him
when he was a teenager.
and from that point
on, he was raised
by various foster parents,
moving from home to home.
kai grew angry and
aggressive over time.
before long, he found himself
in a juvenile detention facility.
his story would have ended there
if he hadn't
discovered bodybuilding.
the feelings of being
unsafe, feeling unsafe,
constantly under threat.
i remember i was in the process
of being restrained while fighting,
my shirt had gotten torn
in the midst of the
whole demonstration,
i'm taking the rest of the
shirt and throwin' it off.
"fuck that, what?"
you know, you go through
this whole display
of "i'm powerful, i'm
angry, i don't care!"
you do this thing, and it
was some time after that
the teacher, i had bumped
into him again maybe
a week or so, back in population.
he had said, "hey, you know,
you got a physique on you!
how you'd like to
think about competing
against teenagers your own age?"
i thought it was a joke.
back then, i never even
used to think that i would
probably ever even get out of being
in institutional placement.
it's a lot easier for me
to have been
identified as an animal.
going to the gym and
training, it was probably
the single most important
therapeutic choice
i could make on my own.
and the people that were in my life
have long since moved on.
the one thing that's
remained consistent
is still, you know, your focus
towards achieving
this ultimate goal.
texas.
wide plains.
open spaces.
scorching heat.
branch warren leads a simple life
away from the hustle
and bustle of the city.
i tore my quadriceps tendon,
and it completely detached.
no one's ever come
back from injury,
you know, that injury,
especially that fast.
most people, it ends their career.
i did it in six months.
and that was an accident, right?
i was walking in the parking lot...
in a thunderstorm.
and...
i slipped and fell.
so, you never know
what kind of curve ball
life's gonna throw at you, right?
some people cry and bitch
about it like little girls,
you know, and be babies about it.
a man, he has issues.
he sets it aside, he
focuses on what he...
what his job is and gets it done.
i put my faith in god.
you know, i learned
from a very young age
that no one owes you anything,
and there ain't nobody
gonna give you a damn thing.
but you can have anything you want
if you work hard enough for it.
what's up?
gotta take care of
business in the gym.
you're with the boys, so you
gotta do what you gotta do.
and when you come home, you don't
bring that home to your family.
metroflex gym.
built inside an old warehouse.
produced many of texas'
greatest bodybuilders,
including the great ronnie coleman,
eight-time mr. olympia.
now it serves as a training
camp for branch warren
and his training
partner, johnnie jackson.
yeah, baby!
one more, go!
yeah!
come on, get some.
nobody beats you.
huh?
i grew up in that gym.
i mean, from learning how to
fight, to learn how to train,
to learn how to be a man.
i don't think there's one bodybuilder
on this planet that's competed...
or even dreamed of competing
that hasn't dreamed
of being mr. olympia.
for 20 years, man,
i go to bed at night
thinkin' about it, and i wake up
in the morning thinkin' about it.
i think about it when i train.
i've accomplished everything in
this sport i set out to accomplish.
i've got one contest left to win.
i'll eat dirt if i have to
eat dirt to win this, so...
i don't care.
you know, you're
goin' against the 15-20
best bodybuilders on the planet.
we all wanna win.
and i'm doing
everything in my power
to make sure i win.
get out, move.
out of my face.
let's go.
branch is one of
those guys who just,
i've never seen him
do anything right,
or efficiently, he just
works hard at everything.
you look at him train, you're like,
"man, i don't know how you
still have any joints left."
and that's why it's
easy to pick on him.
there's just no intelligence.
there's no, like, it's pure work
ethic, man, which is great.
and that's probably nine of the
top tens of guys in the ifbb,
is they're doing the same
crap, day in, day out,
year in, year out, not gettin' any
better, but then they think the result
is gonna be better.
well, news flash for ya,
it's not gonna happen.
take a smarter approach,
take a different approach,
you know, get better at
it, which is why i need...
if i wanna compete with these guys
and beat these guys, i need to take
the most precise,
educated, scientific
approach possible.
the great thing about this machine
it's gonna give us, you know,
any ounce of fat that he loses,
any ounce of muscle that he gains,
it's gonna track it.
it's extremely sensitive.
ben's faith in his scientific
approach to bodybuilding
is complete and unquestioning.
he has no shame in
comparing the failure
of his opponents'
training philosophies
to the efficiency of his own.
you ask him to push
himself to a certain level,
and he finds a way
to push past that.
and we're tryin' to
kill him in the gym,
you know, we're really
trying to push him mentally.
that's perfect.
that's perfect, right there.
squeeze harder.
that's it, squeeze harder.
that's it, perfect!
that's exactly what we want, man.
that... those last
three, four reps,
you were activating
maximal amount of muscle.
that's exactly what
we need for growth.
bodybuilding is the
most fascinating sport
there is in the world.
and in fact, this whole
laboratory is dedicated
to studying bodybuilding.
even nfl linemen, they get big.
and they get a lot of muscle.
but how in the world
can you get massive
and get shredded at the same time?
this is completely counterintuitive
to even science.
so, to study how do you do that
is phenomenal.
i remember it clear
as day, flex magazine,
i was 15 years old at
the ymca in toronto.
and the guy sitting at the
front desk brought one in.
i looked at the cover
of it, and i was like,
"man, that's
disgusting, that's gross.
man, i never wanna look like that."
for me, it was more
along the lines of,
well, i achieved my
goal, now, what's next?
and i achieved my
goal, and what's next?
so, first i wanna be
did it.
wanna be 210 with abs, did it.
and i just keep pushin',
and pushin', and pushin' it.
i guess i was just never content,
never happy with my body.
that's really, you know,
where it started for me.
myself as a bodybuilder,
should be someone
constantly striving to be
one percent better every day,
you know, whether it
be in your workouts,
in your approach to life,
in your mentality,
in your nutrition,
how meticulous you
are with nutrition.
just being better and better.
pushing your... every
aspect of your life.
like, i've always
known that mr. olympia
was something i could do.
if i want it, and
i set my mind to it,
there's nothing that
can stand in my way.
there you go, man, no pain.
come on, hit it, there you go!
drive it!
you think this is fancy,
let's go, hurry up!
man, there's always somebody
trying to reinvent the wheel.
i don't care what kind
of scientific formulas,
or whatever it is you come up with,
or nutrition or whatever.
there's no substitute
for hard, hard work.
and the pain and the
sacrifice, the sweat,
all the hard work, man,
when they announce you winner,
it's all worth it.
heavy clouds loom
over tampa, florida.
roelly winklaar arrives
from rotterdam, holland,
with his trainer, sibil peeters.
in the industry,
she's known as grandma.
but those who've trained with her
know her as the trainer from hell.
ah, rattlesnakes.
i like snakes because i like
how they eat the food, you know?
kill them.
and then eat them, you know?
the body's like this and
they eat like this, you know?
that's the way i like it.
they ask, "where do you come from?"
and i say, curaçao.
in the face, you can see that
they don't know where
that is, you know?
and i say, the caribbean.
then everybody knows the caribbean.
the two always share a
bedroom during their travels,
the mobile kitchen
and key ingredients
traveling along with
them everywhere they go.
sibil herself used to be
a professional bodybuilder.
put the fish on it.
but after the tragic
death of her husband,
she dedicated her life
to training others.
grandma, is my food finished?
is my food finished?
your food is finished.
in the netherlands,
i trained like a week
with the guys.
my body grows fast, you know?
the owner asked me if
i want to do a contest...
i say, "no, i don't
want to do that because
i don't like the
string in your ass!
it's not my style.
and he says,
"it's not string in your ass.
the name is posing
trunks, you know?"
i say, "no, i don't like it."
and he says, "i got
one option for you.
you go on stage, and you win,
you can train for
nothing, and i'll give you
food and supplements."
i say, "but i got one problem.
i got nobody, you know?"
everybody told me to go
to that woman over there.
grandma.
i say "grandma?
are you crazy, man?
don't let me train
with a woman, man!"
"really, she's good, she's good.
"she's one of the best, you know?"
i give her hand, but i say,
"wow, you're a trainer?"
i say, "hey come on,
you can talk to me
straight away, come on."
and then, i find out that
he was very, very shy.
in holland, there was
an ugly word for him.
"look out, he's lazy.
lazy negro."
i say, "come on, guys!"
i trained with him, he's
not lazy, the guy is...
go, go, go, go!
he's like a machine.
in the gym, he's a machine,
nobody can stop him.
he is "the beast."
my dream is to make
a house for my mother.
before my father died,
my father wanted to buy
a big house for her.
but that's not happened.
what my father promised
her, i make her.
tomorrow, in accordance
with the ifbb point system,
roelly must place first or second
in order to qualify
for the olympia stage.
so winklaar...
are you nervous
for the competition?
no.
you're always nervous
before a contest.
it has to be you're nervous,
otherwise on stage, you're...
no, i'm not nervous because...
i know i'm gonna win, you know?
okay.
put down the telephone.
you want to put it down?
put it down.
you sure?
come on, we have to go to sleep!
for a long time, i
have been tired, ok?
hidetada yamagishi has
also yet to qualify.
hide must place in the top two
in order to advance.
if he didn't have a
tan, you wouldn't see
his definition on stage,
you wouldn't see his striations,
his vascularity, anything.
he would just wash out
under the bright lights.
you really gotta be dark
when you get on that stage.
when the guys have to go on stage,
and they go white on stage,
their muscles look small.
when you're painting up,
you can see
the muscles look very, very good.
ok, bend over.
when we are finished,
we are all brown.
seven.
i got nine, jason.
ten, todd's here.
i got 11, i got 12, i got 13.
i got 14, i got 15.
i'm missing 16, shawn?
the bodybuilder
takes the human form
to its utmost visual extreme.
the development of muscles
isn't just a game of measurements.
perfect symmetry is
equally important.

please take the

the check for $1,000...
to our fourth-place finisher.
roelly winklaar!
the road to success
isn't always straight
or clear in this sport.
another loss like tampa
would mean months and years
of training have been wasted.
this means the loss of prize money
and perhaps even a sponsor,
the support line
for any bodybuilder.
lonely nights,
familiar hotel rooms,
long-distance calls
are the only way
to keep in touch with loved ones.
at times when the
family can't be reached,
the trainer is the
only person to talk to.
hey, bro, congratulations!
second place, and
olympia qualification.
i'm happy, and i'm
relieved, you know?
yeah, me too.
i knew you were gonna do
it, but now it's official.
so, we got six weeks to train hard.
alright.
okay, bro, keep in touch,
and thanks for calling.
roelly has trouble
sleeping most nights.
moments ago, he was told that he
has one more chance to qualify,
but he'll have to travel back to
europe to compete at the nordic pro.
winklaar.
you ok?
yeah, grandma.
it's time for your food.
yes.
unless he places first,
his journey will end
before it begins.
victor martinez wasn't
always an inmate.
he was a star,
a star bodybuilder on his way
to conquer the olympia title.
he was incarcerated for
an immigration charge
as a result of his arrest
for a controlled
substance years ago.
to actually be in
jail and want to live
or think of outside, it
just makes it all difficult.
i had to shut down,
there's no making up,
it's lost time, that's it.
i was disappearing.
his stint in jail has left
him far behind his competitors.
and mounting emotional
and financial problems
won't make his return any easier.
a six-month sentence is a
lifetime for a bodybuilder.
you're at war right now,
with other competitors.
and when you do what you have to do
from now to the mr. olympia,
you do what you have to do to win.
and as long as you know you
did what you had to do to win,
nobody can ever say anything
bad about you ever, ever.
because you know in your heart,
you gave it your all.
coming back now, preparing
for the olympia is...
i don't have that
feeling like i'm ready.
i can't say i walked in
and had the best workout.
the first time i went
in, it was horrible.
i'm touching the
weights, and it's...
there's no connection, i
didn't really eat in there.
seven, 800 calories, most
of it was through bread
and you know, junk
food, snickers bars.
i'd say right now,
every workout i do is important.
between meals and training,
between court-ordered
appointments,
between his separation
from his girlfriend,
between all these things, he
tries to maintain his sanity.
he tries to find time to be
a father to his four children.
two boys, which are
autistic, and two young girls,
all from different mothers
i'm backed up on child support,
i still take care of my kids,
but, they freeze your bank account,
they suspend your license
and yes, i'm driving
illegally right now.
so what, what can you do, you know?
let's warm up, after
this, we gotta pick it up.
i'm not mentally ready, it's...
it's bothersome every single day.
it's bothering because i'm
working on it every day,
you know, preparing myself.
pick up your spirit, let's go.
come on, man!
we gotta do this.
come on!
great set.
i can't keep going like this.
i gotta try to pick it up, man.
i'm playing with the big boys, man.
that's why we gotta push.
you'll get back there again.
push it.
that's it.
come on!
you can do this.
you're gonna do this, man.
you gotta stay focused.
i mean...
you want to be on that
stage again, right?
yeah, of course.
i strive on fear.
if something scares
me, if i'm afraid of it,
i always want to face it.
my entire life is the
fricking stock market, man!
right now, i'm in a recession.

dennis wolf wanders through
the halls of nbc networks.
this is a dream come
true for the bodybuilder
from germany.
a moment of classic
american celebrity,
an interview on the
nationalized television show.
this is his time,
his moment to grasp a hold of fame.
welcome back to
"the morning blend."
they're fit, they're strong,
but there can only be one!
the world's top
bodybuilders are competing
to bring home the coveted
title of mr. olympia.
i was a big fan of
arnold schwarzenegger,
and bodybuilding, i
fell in love right away,
when i walk out... you know,
walk in for the first
time into the gym
and that was my thing.
people are going to
america to have success,
the first six months was
hard because people are,
"oh, look at this
guy, he's probably just
lifting weights and that's it.
dumb, stupid," because
people have no idea
what is bodybuilding.
you need someone who can push you,
and it's not easy to find
someone who can push me,
that's why i have dennis.
your know, every time
we train together,
he finish me, he's finishing me,
and, you know, i'm sore for days.
come on, one more, come on!
- too big pump!
- come on!
that's what we're here for!
we gonna pump the iron, come on!
slow, dennis, slow, slow, slow.
slow!
that's good and three...
let's go!
hup, hup, hup!
stand up and move around a little.
you have to lose that
one, i'm really dizzy.
anybody ready to break dance?
almost drowned!
germany, with its cold
and oppressive rain
stands in stark contrast
to vegas' glaring sunshine.
to him, america is the chance
to become one of the greats.
to become an arnold.
to become a star.
wolf's stepdaughter visits
him as often as she can.
their relationship
is as strong as iron,
despite the lack of blood ties.
i saw him every day.
it's... yeah.
i didn't think he's
big, it's normal for me,
every day i saw him.
everybody should place
where they deserve.
it's hard when you
have so many judges
and you have so
many great athletes,
where the standard is so close,
you could throw a coin.
you know, apples or
oranges, what do you like?
you know, it is
that close sometimes,
"he was great, wow, wow, wow."
how do you judge?
he has a better smile,
he has green eyes,
he has blue eyes,
he has brown eyes.
you know what i mean...
it's hard, it's not easy.
every muscle part must
be completely perfect.
no weak points, we get
judged by weak points.
if you don't have
the better symmetry,
the better muscle
maturity, muscle quality,
as mr. olympia, you don't win.
do the double biceps.
try to open up, pull up, pull up...
and bend the wrists
back a little bit.
"oh, his hairstyle.
he's gotta be gay,
there's something wrong.
i just... somethings
wrong with that guy,
he's just so different!
you'll never be a champion.
you might win a show but...
you'll never be mr. olympia!"
while others will
celebrate, you know,
achieving master's and ph.d.s...
i won bodybuilding competitions.
and now i stand here, at
the top of this experience,
looking at winning the highest...
title in the bodybuilding world.
turn your wrist in, pull it tight!
flex your hamstrings, pull tight!
pull.
pull.
pull it.
pull it!
roll it over a little more, kai.
there we go, pop
your hamstring out.
squeeze... all the way down!
bring this up... pull
tight, hamstring up a little.
posing is a very valuable
tool to build a physique,
to build a physique
that is historically
the physique that is bodybuilding.
it's not just enough
to go to the gym,
and just train, and lift weights.
there's an internal connection
with the contractions
that your muscles make.
what i'm really talking about
is the presence of
the artistic mind
that ultimately
sculpts the physique.
lower your shoulders,
you're doing it wrong.
let's do it again.
no, do it again.
suck it in...
legs, legs, legs.
you're forgetting about your legs.
people always tell me,
"hey, he's looking tired.
you let him do too much."
but he's always up
late on the internet,
coming in the gym
with a face like this.
that makes me angry!
it's not allowed.
i respect you, you
have to respect me.
don't come with a face like this
because you didn't sleep.
go to your bed, you have to rest.
let me know when you're finished.
you need your energy on the stage,
when you don't have
it on the stage,
you can lose everything.
- i know.
- in the off-season,
do what you want, don't
do it in the competition!
- what's up, champ?
- dennis james,
a retired bodybuilder, and mentor
in the eyes of most athletes,
doesn't sugarcoat criticism.
from posing, to diet, to training,
his astute eye can
identify any problem.
so this time you have to
really, really go out there,
and you have to nail it...
and i talked to a judge
who said that you lose
two spots on his sheets
because of the way you
pose, you know what i mean?
so this is something
you can control.
you can work on that.
- you can show him.
- yeah, of course.
you're here, please help.
now pull it down, like
you do a lat pulldown,
and now open up... there you go.
see, now he has some
movement going on.
the judge told me this
was not coming out,
and that's why.
you know how you bring that out?
just try this one time.
instead of going right
into something like this,
try to go up, pull it down,
then open up, 'cause
you create music.
this is again what i'm saying,
you move, eyes on you.
always start from the bottom,
legs, hamstrings, glutes.
now arms, all the way, straight up.
just like... that's
it, just like that!
that's what i want him
to do, see the difference?
- you see that?
- yeah.
our third-place finalist,
representing germany, number two,
ronny rockel.
let's take the
first runner-up award
and present that to...
by way of poland, number eight,
robert piotrkowicz.
the first-place prize,
and moving on to the
mr. olympia contest...
roelly winklaar!
- finally!
- finally!
nice job!
this what we worked so hard for!
hey, finally...
finally, we made it through.
yes, finally.
we are...
up to the...
- mr. o.
- o, nice!
the martinez family moved
to washington heights, new york,
from the dominican republic
when victor was six years old.
he grew up in a house
with seven sisters,
two brothers, an
overbearing mother,
and a strict, unsupportive father.
that lack of support
and understanding
has plagued victor's
ambitions his entire career.
getting smaller, man!
what's up... you're
not working out, man!
trying to, i'm gonna
get to the gym, man.
good, good, good.
get me a ticket or
something, i'll go!
yeah, all right.
in 2009, victor's sister,
iridania, was murdered.
iridania always
cooked meals for victor
before his competitions.
her absence affects
him to this day.
you say "daddy"?
no... so you want ice cream?
no?
i know you want...
oh!
what was that kiss for?
that was all for me?
victor loves returning
to his old neighborhood,
where everything seems so familiar.
familiar faces, familiar places.
this is a place he will
always call home in his heart,
mostly because of his daughter,
who still resides
here with her mother.
quitting has not been a choice,
only because i cannot see myself
explaining this to my kids.
right now, i have to
provide for my family.
i need bodybuilding to survive.
- goddamn!
- all right, bro.
how are you doin', bro?
fast!
killing yourself
down here, already?
yeah, i have to, man.
- the only way to go, bro!
- no doubt!
i'm very proud of you, you hear me?
god bless you, bro!
my judgment day will be
seeing steve weinberger.
seeing the judge,
and him telling me
if i'm ready for the
olympia stage or not.
yeah, look at your hamstrings.
i'm telling you, victor,
you have a lot of work to
do before you see steve.
can i get two pounds?
- two pounds?
- yes, sir.
it's pretty intense.
it's always intense.
somebody may ask you,
"is it that serious?"
it's always that serious.
i'm a professional at what i do.
i'm not a fan, i'm not a spectator,
i'm not the person at home,
i'm the man living this.
if i don't eat like this,
i don't make conscious food choices
when it's time to make them,
every day, all day,
then the goods won't be
there when i need them to be.
this is the easy part.
if you can't do the easy stuff,
then what do you do
when life happens?
things will come and test you.
a loved one goes to the hospital.
it's abrupt.
you feel obligated or compelled
to want to be there.
you still gotta be in the gym
at six o'clock in the morning.
you still gotta start your meals,
so for you to stay focused,
it's not a sacrifice,
it has to be a lifestyle.
when you're training
for the competition,
it consumes your whole day...
bodybuilders, by
definition, most of 'em
will tell you are very
self-centered and selfish.
even if you're not that type of person,
you become that kind of person,
because you never get away from it,
because your nutrition,
when you're dieting,
for mr. olympia, you can't eat out,
because you have
to weigh your food,
you have to have so many carbs,
so much protein, so much water...
you have to control
what's in the food.
- what you got?
- we got beef, chicken,
turkey, beans,
potato salad and coleslaw.
like a bunch of marinade
and things on it?
not it's just...
salt.
cool, man.
damn, ain't gonna be
getting none of that today.
you can eat seven, eight
times a day, like some people.
i'm like, "yeah, you gotta
eat a lot of clean food."
and then the mom will
say, "yeah, my son eats,
he eats everything..."
yeah, he's eating everything.
that's why he's not lean.
suppose to mix this in a drink,
but goes down fine just
like this, so why not?
most other people,
they go to the store,
they'll buy some product.
they just...
and hoping for the best.
they don't know how
that actually works.
they don't know the science
behind those supplements.
they don't care, and
they're not supposed to,
i get that... but, yeah,
we're the dumb-dumbs.
we're the people that
don't know anything,
but just bein' a box
of rocks with weights,
and all this other stuff,
we're the meatheads,
we're the idiots...
we're able to do something
that 99.8 percent of the
people on the earth can do,
which is lose fat
and gain muscle, at the same time.
they don't know that
we eat seven, eight,
nine thousand calories a day.
they don't know
that we're in the gym
two, three times a
day, six days a week.
right away, they want to
just diminish your work.
by going to that one little
thing and brush it off,
they're saying, "you know what, it's
because they're taking steroids."
the overall perception
of steroids, obviously,
is something that
cheaters only use.
we are realizing now that
the truth of the matter
is any athlete at the professional
or world-class level...
is likely using some form
of performance-enhancing drugs.
anabolic steroids don't make
what professional
bodybuilders do easier.
it simply allows them to
take it to that extreme level.
anabolic steroids are
basically testosterone,
or testosterone derivatives.
so in the body, when you
take a synthetic form,
it basically gets
into the muscle cell,
attaches to receptors
that are in that cell,
and then that turns on
genes in the muscle cell
that produce more protein.
that's the way it
enhances muscle size.
many of the athletes simply
refuse to talk on the subject.
it's taboo.
others are willing to
engage in the conversation.
because people...
take too much of this stuff,
and don't know how to use it,
that gives bodybuilding
a bad, bad name.
the media likes to portray
it as being very sensational
but steroids aren't addictive,
steroids never killed anybody.
there's no physiological
proof, it's never been shown,
it's all what the
media wants you to see.
society's reaction to steroids
is often hypocritical
and judgmental.
i think it's a
contradiction, to be honest,
'cause most
bodybuilders that i know
and that i've met are on steroids,
or have done steroids,
and for somebody who wants
to portray themselves as
a fit and healthy person,
that's not at all healthy.
people go, "ahh, steroids," man...
nobody can do that.
like, it's not easy to do.
people don't respect it,
they go, "oh, i can do that
with steroids," no, you couldn't.
you couldn't do what i do!
they come to the gym,
never did a workout,
and then they find
on the internet...
steroids... they sell
steroids on the internet.
children, 15, 16 years
old, they order it...
that's what i hate... it's
dangerous, very dangerous.
if you do something extreme,
you can't be healthy,
you gotta take some risks.
so it's like, you
know, like racing...
if you go formula
one, you take the risk.
any time that you're using
performance enhancers,
particularly when we haven't
studied them in the lab,
to the level that they can be used,
certainly, there can be
negative side effects.
there is issues with kidney damage,
there is, what we do know,
is that the heart size increases
because the heart is a
muscle, there's liver issues,
it's quite toxic,
especially the oral drugs,
that's why injectables are
one of the preferred drugs
for minimizing health risks.
i think the best answer
is to allow the athletes
to use the drugs, but
provide medical treatment.
get a group of very
competitive athletes together,
everyone wants to win,
you've got large sums of money
up for grabs, guys are going to do
whatever it takes to win.
the bodybuilders and
the professional sport
of bodybuilding has
gone the next step.
where all of a sudden,
the body does not look
as acceptable, simply
because it's too big,
and it doesn't have
any talent behind it.
and the neck is 23 inches
and the calves are 18.
the proportion is gone.
the audience wants
to see a spectacle.
when they go to see a
show, they don't want to see
someone that looks like them,
they want to see something extreme.
so we have to get huge.
we have to go to the next level.
you know, is there
a limit to growth?
certainly, there's a limit,
but i don't know that we found it.
they ask the olympic athletes,
if you could take a drug,
right now, that would
kill you in five years,
but guarantee you a gold
medal, would you take it?
more than 50 percent said "yes!"
they would take it, even knowing it
would kill them five years later.
this is what these athletes do.
this this their lives.
this is their livelihood,
this is how they make money.
this is everything they know.
do you really think you're
gonna convince them to stop?
as time progresses, the
science of bodybuilding
advances faster and
faster, and with it,
the size of the muscles.
one more major title this year.
one down.
one to go!
three, four, five, six...
come on, one way!
eight, nine...
ten!
every rep count!
every rep, come on!
bring the pain!
- six, seven, eight, nine...
- fight it!
my physique that i bring
to the olympia this year...
it's not the product of
three months of hard work,
it's the product of over
i thought i'd be retired
by now, originally.
i thought by 36, 35-36, i'd be...
i'd be retired, but...
you know, i think i've
had so many injuries,
i've had four significant injuries,
since i've been pro,
and i think that set me back.
when you work out, do you
feel sore the next day?
you rebuild pretty
quickly, right, i mean...
yeah, man, i get sore as fuck.
i think when people say
they don't get sore, man,
that's 'cause they're
not continually
pushing their limits, you know?
if you push it as hard as
you can push it every day,
and you don't go to failure
and go beyond what you've done,
then you're gonna get sore.
guys like ronnie, they
got bigger every year.
dorian, you know, all
those guys that are trained
to annihilate the muscle, you know,
they came in bigger
and better every year.
so, that's the difference.
due to injuries, branch had to skip
the 2010 and 2011 olympias.
despite this, he continues to
live his life to the fullest.
branch, a few competitors said
that, "if you're gonna keep
working out the way
you're doing at the gym,
you're going to get injured
before the big competition."
what do you think about that?
they're entitled to their opinion.
but, you know, i can
imagine who that was,
and they ain't gonna
beat me anyway, so...
they don't really matter.
and the thing is, the
past two injuries i've had
weren't in the gym, they
were outside the gym.
so, i haven't been
hurt in the gym since...
c'mon.
let's go!
oh!
goddamn!
ouch!
son of a bitch!
goddamn, guys.
the filming stops.
branch's hamstring is injured.
his future at the
olympia is now uncertain.
i just know that the end
of a bodybuilding career
is one injury away... one
major injury and you're toast.
no matter how hard you work,
and how perfect you are,
one injury and you're done.
the days of being in the dungeon,
training with your hoodie on,
you know, "grunt and
cuss" bodybuilder,
that eats, sleeps and trains...
that's all he does... are over.
you have to be able
to do other things.
i'm more focused now on my career,
but of course i think
about the years after it
because, i don't want to be like,
"okay, now it is over,
so let's think about
what i can do now."
of course, it would be
nice if i could get some
roles in the movies,
things like this.
i just got a call
for a casting tomorrow
for an action film, so we'll see...
they're gonna fly me in...
the movie star!
...with a private jet.
i don't want to waste my time
trying to be an actor or something,
if i don't have
the talent for this.
there some that
have the personality.
when i started doing
interviews in the '70s,
the media always said,
"finally there's someone
that loves to talk
about the sport,"
because for years we
tried to get interviews
and everyone just said,
"no, i'm not going to talk,"
because they were
always shy characters,
and they'd rather live
in a dungeon and work out,
and were very impressive,
but they didn't want to talk,
they felt too shy about it.
all these guys say they
want to be like arnold,
and be in the movies,
and stuff like that.
sometimes, it's like pulling teeth
to get these guys to talk.
so, imagine giving them a script
they actually have to read.
- hi.
- hi.
how you doing... oh!
dennis, nice to meet you.
so, emilio ferrari is
directing this movie,
and we're gonna start
shooting it in october,
but it is a comedy,
and it's kinda like
"private benjamin"
meets "legally blonde."
so we can have fun with this,
and if you want to
try something new,
or have improv or anything,
don't feel that you
can't do that, okay?
- so, you are reading for robert.
- robert, right.
hello, i'm robert...
hello, i'm robert starkey.
wow, you really love this country.
- so, here's what...
- uh... the united states.
yeah, i'm sorry.
let's try it again,
now there are some parts
where you are
coughing and mumbling,
you know like, you're...
so play that a little bit.
hello, i'm robert starkey.
if you sign this right
now, i can't guarantee it...
i can't guarantee,
by this time tomorrow
you will be in sunny puerto rico.
that was really good and
we're probably gonna have
callbacks, which i'm
gonna bring you back
to the director,
and that was funny.
so just take it and work on it,
and we'll see each other later.
thank you very much, it was great.
- it was nice meeting you.
- nice meeting you, too.
- thank you.
- all right, take care.
while playing
basketball in college,
phil realized that he would
never play professionally,
but there was
potential in his genes,
potential that led
him to another sport.
that's right.
i would say quitting
basketball, i mean...
it wasn't really
quitting, i'll be honest,
i just wasn't good enough
to play at the next level.
those dreams, as far as
like, playing in the nba,
were just... they were squashed.
- this is phil heath.
- hi, nice to meet you.
good to meet you.
at times, nostalgia kicks in.
he loved to play ball just as much
as he loves bodybuilding now.
when the opportunity
presents itself,
phil enjoys to return to the court
to shoot some hoops.
when i decided to be a
bodybuilder and quit basketball,
i actually marked down the date,
it was october 8th, 2002,
and then the rest is history...
i got bit by that bug,
and it was an amazing
feeling to know that,
coming from a team sport...
you know, you're
being more concerned
with not just yourself, but
your teammates all the time,
and going against a
different type of opposition.
playing basketball, as
opposed to bodybuilding,
where it's really
all about my effort.
pittsburgh, a city
with more than blood
running through its veins.
sweat, steel, and hard work
pulse at its heart as well.
it's home to jim
manion, the president
of the international federation
of bodybuilding & fitness pro.
the chairman of the
national physique committee,
jim acts as a father
of sorts to many
of the greatest bodybuilders,
phil heath among them.
you're on the road so much
because you're so popular,
where the other guys
that are chasing you,
they're not getting as
many guest appearances,
store appearances from
the sponsors, et cetera.
so they're at home training
where they're comfortable.
different priorities take
over in your life too.
your family, you want to spend
more time with your family.
you know, they're ticked off.
i don't have any children
of my own, you know,
but like, my wife and i, we talk about
it and it's like, what's gonna happen?
you know, i have a
stepson, but he's old enough
to fend for himself.
but i can already tell,
just by having two dogs
that the minute i'm gone,
they tear everything up.
see this?
touch this.
whoa!
say, "i'm bigger than you."
show him yours.
all right, phil, i'm not gonna give you
any advice you don't already know.
we talked already about bringing the
same condition you did last year.
everybody's gonna be chasing you
so you don't have to
worry about getting bigger
than this guy or
smaller than that guy.
so, just kinda go back
and do what you do.
yeah, i don't have
to reinvent the wheel.
bring it again and
hope for the best.
for me, as mr. olympia,
it's not about beating
your competition, it's
about crushing those dreams
of those other guys... and
that's what i've got to do,
i've gotta crush their dreams.
it's a gloomy afternoon.
victor travels to the
bev francis powerhouse gym
in syosset, new
york, to see a legend,
his mentor, steve weinberger.
today is his judgment day.
- hey, what's goin' on, brother?
- 'sup, steve?
- how you doin'?
- good, good, how you doin'?
i'm okay, how you feel?
i'm okay, i've felt better.
yeah... how's it coming along?
i don't feel confident.
let me close the door...
too much noise out there.
as soon as i got out,
i started training,
and getting back on my regimen...
the training's been good,
everything's been good, no
injuries, you know, and, uh...
everything's good, it's
just, is it "olympia good"?
is it "olympia ready"?
- let's see what you look like.
- all right.
for rikers island,
you look great, vic,
but for the olympia...
i don't think you'll have enough
time, honestly, i'm sorry.
if i was you, i would shut it down,
and just concentrate on next year.
i don't think there's
enough time, i'm sorry.
how you feelin', victor?
i just don't want
to talk, right now.
please, c'mon.
hey, v.
yeah, i just saw steve.
yeah, i decided i'm
not doing the show.
he's a guy that's gotten no breaks, with
his sister getting murdered, and...
this is his second
time in jail, and...
just all these problems,
it just seems that...
you never know why some good people
never get breaks,
and some bad people get breaks.
and victor is one of those good
guys that never get a break,
and i feel bad for
him, i really do.
hide lives a solitary
life in venice, california,
near the beach.
when he looks across the water,
he sometimes imagines
he can see home.
though he is married, he
spends most of his time
separate from his wife,
who often travels to japan
to take care of his family...
a family that has never fully
accepted his life path,
nor fully understood it.
they don't watch my shows,
but they call me and i call them.
it's a really hard sport.
for me, my thinking is that
they can't enjoy their life.
i was born, born to be bodybuilder.
i'm a bodybuilder until i die.
i hope that one day
my family understands.
people thought that
it's just impossible
for japanese or asian people
to step on olympia stage...
because of their structure
or genetics, i don't know...
i wouldn't say i'm
small 'cause i'm 5'5".
but i weigh 220,
which is pretty heavy.
olympia.
nice... are you gonna win?
- say yes.
- yeah, i will.
yeah, say "i'm gonna
win the olympia!"
yes i will.
come on.
- you do a couple negative?
do a couple negative,
hold it, resist me, resist.
resist, let's go.
let's go, come on, man!
good job, hide, come on, come on!
all the way down, all the way down.
all the way down, and up.
one more.
hold it. resist me.
resist!
come on!
let's go.
all the way down.
i mean, the whole
game is about quality.
this is the way you are.
most of them, no
disrespect, but some of 'em,
they don't follow that elegance.
i see your moves
are really artistic
and i think that's what
bodybuilding is all about,
being an artist.
let's see.
unreal, just keep it like...
careful.
beautiful.
exhale.
when you hit it, exhale.
then all that detail
right in the middle.
right, good.
see?
looks like the base is good
and everything flows.
if you don't see
it in your mind eye,
you can just forget it.
you got to believe.
i know for sure that
hide does believe.
and i mean, we're not pretending.
i mean, look at this guy.
he's just amazing.
so, i really used
to dream about this.
when i came out here, i mean,
i had some people saying,
like, "you're not gonna win
the olympia, are you crazy?
no way, this is impossible."
it's not impossible.
everything is possible.
here you got a guy from
the middle east region,
and not to brag about
it, i'm the only one
from that part of the
world to win the title,
and you got hide from the far east.
i tell you, he's this
close, he's this close.
i challenge you to
win the olympia, man.
come on.
i'm still, you know,
challenging the title.
if i'm a champion, i would say
there will be a lot of pressure.
there's always that pressure...
you gotta be your best,
'cause you're only as good as your
last contest, in our sport...
no matter how well you placed at the
last show, if you do poorly at this one,
this is the one
everybody remembers...
i think that's why
a lot of guys fail,
is because there's
so much pressure.
sponsors drop you.
i better be ready, you know.
i better be ready to bring it.
here we go!
fight!
perfect!
make 'em grow!
here we go.
no pain, no pain.
fight!
that's it!
you got this, man, no pain!
as a competition looms
in the near future,
the pressure builds.
training and rigorous routines
take a toll on the body,
as well on the mind.
each bodybuilder seeks
out different ways
to alleviate the stress.
you know what you're getting?
i'm gonna get a sushi
and sashimi combo.
i need no avocado,
and no fake crab.
i'm gonna do the
spicy teriyaki chicken.
and can i add extra chicken
to that, or double chicken?
and then i wanna do the twt roll
and plus the titty roll.
okay, thank you very much.
the what roll?
titty.
- titi.
- oh, titi, sorry.
i'll take this outta your way.
so how clean you... we gotta
keep it real tight tonight.
oh yeah, oh yeah, man.
that's one of the
things i find separates
the good bodybuilders from the
great bodybuilders is an appetite.
i'm not sure why, i
haven't figured it out,
maybe it's just the sheer
amount of calories they get in,
but the best
bodybuilders in the world
eat a lot of food.
right now, i'm about 4,000,
off season i try to get in 7,000.
like, if you wanna just
grow, you can go up eight
to ten thousand, as long as
you're training hard enough.
i think a lot of bodybuilders
are apt to getting discouraged
and what not 'cause i
think a lot of us have
a little bit of muscle dysmorphia.
you know, never big enough,
you're never lean enough.
think about the people that
are drawn to bodybuilding.
you always got some type of...
either you're really skinny
as a kid or you got picked on.
you got some type
of body image issues.
yeah, great point.
what day you coming to vegas?
thursday.
if you need me to bring anything out
there, if you need anything on my end,
you know, especially during
the two days before the show
or the day of the show.
i'm actually expecting
to probably have
at least 50, probably 70 of
my close friends at the show.
like, people who have
been my biggest supports
since i even started competing.
i think the place is gonna go nuts for me,
man, and that just lifts you on stage.
just stay relentless, bro, rig ht?
stay hungry.
as long as you keep focused.
like, right now, never
been so focused in my life.
if i can continue with
this for the next...
until the olympia, i'm
gonna be, by far, my best.
and then if i can continue
with this type of focus
until next year, i'll
be unbeatable, man.
i really believe that
i'll bring a package
that nobody can touch.
is there anybody
that you're worried
about competing against?
there's probably two guys
in the world who, i think,
if they bring their best, and i
bring my best, they can beat me.
other than that,
nobody's gonna beat me,
so i just gotta come with my best.
i want everybody to
bring their a game,
and if somebody beats
me, i'll shake his hand,
'cause he outworked me, but
i don't see it happening.
i met phil at a mutual
friend's restaurant
after his second
bodybuilding competition,
that he won his class, but
he didn't take the overall.
and i just knew,
like, i just saw the...
what he was working for, that
he was gonna become great,
and that everything
was gonna go for him.
and he's like "really...
you really think i'm gonna
make it that big?" and
i said, "absolutely,
i think you're gonna
go all the way."
i'm glad i have a
family that can go
on this journey with me, i'm not going at
this separate, and them just watching.
they're there.
they'll be there.
i'll have the list for
tickets for you by tomorrow.
did you spell my name right?
i'm just kidding.
so here's the thing
with phil and i,
we always got along, man...
i've never had a problem
with him... i was
in denver last year,
we went out to dinner,
and then i leave,
and i hear he was talking
shit... and i was like,
"okay, you're a scumbag...
you say one thing in my face
and something else to
my back," that's fine.
and to me, that says he's
insecure and he's scared.
i don't respect his work ethic.
i don't respect him as a
person, with his attitude.
but he's become an
excellent bodybuilder.
he's not a very good
role model for the sport.
is he as dominant as
everybody thinks he is?
no, he's not... but i've
seen him train and i'm like,
"man, his back sucks,
his calves suck,
his hamstrings suck,"
man, that stuff,
you fix it like this, like, i can't build
muscle nearly as easily as that guy,
and yet i'm doing it, you know?
it ain't all talk when
you're on that stage, man.
phil heath has had a lot of gifts.
he's a gift, he's "the gift."
i don't represent
gifts, i really don't.
he's had a lot of
help, a lot of help.
it's not like i had people
handing me money and stuff.
when i first came into this sport,
i was working two jobs, unlike him.
i don't even know
if he has a resume...
i don't even know if
he knows what that is.
easy, easy.
guess what, kai?
you've been bodybuilding
for 20 years.
i'm already better than you.
you know it, but now you're making an
excuse, saying, "he got this, he got that."
each man's body
will represent years
of focus and concentration.
it'll be a great event.
you're one injury away
from your career being over.
i've fought too hard
to get where i'm at,
to slide back down.
i'm not one to lay
down and cry about it.
i'm gonna take this
thing by the horns,
i'm gonna overcome it... i'm
doing everything i can do,
man, i'm 100 percent.
have a dream.
everybody need to have a dream.
have a dream and go after
it with everything you got.
time to make phil look
small, bro. come on!
make 'em all look small.
yup.
they're gonna announce my
name, crowd's gonna go crazy,
i'm gonna hit my front
double bicep, this and that.
crowd's gonna go,
"whoa!"
and i'm gonna just...
i'm gonna feel...
like a true adonis,
man, like a god.
but this trophy is mine.
come on, take your shirt off.
yo, who do you think
was the best ever?
best ever?
arnold or lee?
arnold.
arnold was better than lee haney?
of course.
that's a big statement
to say on camera!
how many, how many
olympias has arnold got?
seven.
how many lee got?
- eight.
- eight.
so who will be better?
arnold, still arnold!
hold on, wait a
minute, so we go back...
then you gotta go with what
century you was in or what...
it doesn't matter how
many olympias he won.
it doesn't matter?
doesn't matter.
who's had the best, what year...
who had the best chill body ever?
ronnie coleman.
ronnie coleman?
he was a good one.
all right, big...
hold on, one thing!
let's arm wrestle.
you lost!
oh!
olympia, a plain in greece
in the western peloponnese.
the ancient olympic games
were said to be played
on this stretch of ground,
and it held the chief sanctuary
of the supreme god, zeus.
now on a stage in
vegas, the supreme man,
mr. olympia, will be crowned.
when i go back and i
think of the olympia,
i go back and i think
of arnold schwarzenegger,
when the first prize
money was $1,000.
and then today, in
the 48th olympia,
we're hoping to
give out prize money
of one million dollars.
good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.
welcome to joe
weider's olympia fitness
and performance weekend 2012!
just before the competition,
the contenders begin their
pre-show preparations.
the most agonizing is
dropping their water weight.
we always need to lose
a little bit of water
in the last couple of
hours before the show
because on stage,
with all those lights
and the tan and the oil, you
still look a little watery.
if you lose the water,
it makes you look
on stage much, much dryer
because all the cuts,
all the separation, coming through
more and more, you know?
now i'll introduce
the 19 competitors here
to vie for the
title of mr. olympia.
before olympia, a
press conference is held
for the contenders.
for the first time,
but not the last,
they are on stage together.
what do you think about people
saying phil can't be beat
at this year's
olympia tomorrow night?
i don't give a damn
about what people say.
i think i'm a better
poser than branch.
well, i think i'm a better
bodybuilder than dennis.
this is a bodybuilding contest,
not a dance contest, baby.
going into tomorrow night,
i'm crossing my
fingers, praying to god
that i can be at my
best, because my best
will be good enough
to win another sandow.
no question.
i'm happy i'm here,
i worked hard for it.
you'll see the best package
you've ever seen tomorrow night.
if you and phil heath are
who wins?
i expect to be the last
man standing this year.
a fallen warrior
arrives in las vegas.
it pains him to be a spectator,
for this sport and its contenders
have been his most constant family.
my phone used to ring
off the hook, you know?
now it's a little quiet
and it's... damn, you know?
am i taking it personal?
it's like you really
can't, you know?
it's what it is.
remember, it's... it's a business
and if you're not producing,
they could just drop
you, and that's something
i might have to do as
well, go into my next show
without a sponsor,
and that's gonna be
one of the biggest
challenges of my life,
not just coming back from injury
or coming back from seven
months of being incarcerated,
it's gonna be competing
as a free agent.
that goes into the
whole question of,
"does politics exist
in bodybuilding?"
it's alive and well.
the hypocrisy is
part of the business,
it's part of it.
the makings of a
champion are elusive.
is it in the genes?
are some destined for greatness
while others doomed to mediocrity?
or is a warrior made,
forged out of steel,
honed from oak and
chiseled from the stone
of his skilled hands?
the mr. olympia competition
has been sanctioned
by the ifbb since 1965.
it alone decides who is
the best in the world.
come on, branch.
i didn't even get to pump up!
can someone bring me some
dumbbells or something?
we're back at the 2012 mr. olympia.
i'm lane norton with
my co-host, larry pepe,
and larry, we talked about...
is this the beginning
of a run for phil?
if he hits it tonight,
do you think he starts
to put these guys
more in his rear view,
and start to build on that momentum
and maybe get three, four,
five, six mr. olympias?
i think coming in, we thought
the question for phil is:
is this gonna be that
type of performance
where you just look
up there, you see him
and you say, "it's him,"
and everybody else kinda
battling out for second?
i think we now feel that
it's him and kai greene.
ladies and gentlemen, as you know,
the mr. olympia final
results will be based
on a combination of both tonight's
and tomorrow's scores.
the lights flash.
the pre-judging begins.
there's just something
to be said for the dude
that can...
man, he can...
he can run up in there with an arm
tied behind his back and still...
he's still a deadly dude.
man, you still gotta
watch out for him!
and even with that,
this dude is still
fighting for his life.
and then...
slowly...
persuade the masses
to start to favor him.
when you line up the
best in the world,
it's so easy to judge.
when you're right there in person,
you see everything.
sometimes a photographer
will take a picture
and phil's looking great,
jay doesn't look great,
or kai or branch,
you need to see it all together
and also, it's not the clearest
of quality on the internet,
not like in living color.
being there and seeing
it, it's pretty easy.
phil heath and kai
greene, right off the bat,
seem to separate
themselves from the pack.
those two clearly,
number one and number two.
if there was any question,
we answered that in
the final call-out
when they were the only two
brought back, center stage.
i think there's a lot of
support out there for kai greene,
there's a lot of people who think
that he's winning this contest.
listen to me, you beat
him every freakin' shot.
hands down.
hands down, okay?
and the feeling
was, he was terrible.
he was picking your best shots too,
side triceps,
back double biceps, you
frickin' creamed him.
do you really think that, george?
you have the frickin'
edge, would i lie to you?
it's mr. olympia,
the best of the best.
you saw it.
once you start, you know?
that was getting close
with the whole kai thing and...
kai starts good,
he started getting better
until he becomes great and then,
and then you shave it
down to the top guys
and those top guys
were phil and kai.
the drama came in there,
'cause first you go,
"okay, yeah, you know, phil's
walking away with this,"
then you look, you go,
"wait a minute, this is
getting closer than i think."
the more you look,
the closer it got.
i mean, i don't know how
much tighter i can get.
i wouldn't try to get
fuller if i was you.
thank you.
i mean, really.
there's no way i could
be any tighter than i was.
i mean, i lose room all
the way up past my hip.
what else can i do?
i mean, you tell me
where i can be tighter.
i think i was tighter
than last year,
easily, easily but...
i think what i presented
was good enough for the win.
but we'll wait and see.
- want some water, champ?
- no, i'm good.
not always gonna
hear what you want.
so that's when you exit.
because you don't need to
hear negativity right now.
if anything, i like to be the guy
that smiles, plays
nicely, you know?
but i'm trying to
take your head off
just like anybody else.
don't sleep!
okay, now i am starting
to get irritated,
like, i can't deal with
that shit right now.
you know what i'm saying?
i can't think like that right now.
that shit has no
importance whatsoever
to me winning this show.
we won last year
with a perfect score.
it'd be nice to try to do it again.
it would be nice, i mean,
i don't know if that's hany's goal.
that's mine.
it's always a goal to try to win.
to win, perfect score.
i mean, this is definitely
a hard focus right now,
there's no soft focus at all.
like, this is
definitely very serious.
when you start stressing,
your body starts changing.
and just... and a lot of people
who've done competitions have
looked absolutely amazing,
and then, all of a sudden,
the stress hormone kicks in,
and their bodies
just kinda fade away
and they don't
understand what happened.
this is not where you
let off the gas, either.
i'm gonna have to get going.
catch your breath, that's right.
- huh?
- catch your breath.
come on!
that's right.
yeah, if you want.
i know i'm the champ.
i don't have to keep saying it.
they know i'm the champ, too.
my title is mr. olympia.
theirs isn't.
and they're trying to get there?
they've gotta fight me all day.
there's no way i'm gonna lose.
the champ takes a moment to drive
through the streets of
vegas to clear his head.
the most important
battle of his life
lies here moments away.
the battle that will define
him as a competitor forever.
as you know, it's olympia weekend.
ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,
bodybuilding fans
from around the world,
welcome to the 48th
edition of the fall classic,
the mr. olympia!
for those that was here last night,
you saw one of the most
exciting pre-judgings
in olympia history.
because once again, folks, only one person
can hold the sandow and only one man
will be crowned mr. olympia.
mr. olympia is my
dream, my life dream.
i can't think of anything else
that will ever happen to me again in
my life that will mean as much to me,
because it was
nothing but sheer will,
determination, and stubbornness.
i knew from the time i was 18
what i wanted to do in life.
i set goals for myself.
i've accomplished every
goal i set out for myself,
except for one, and
that's win the mr. olympia.
i'm training for this title,
i want to win this title.
my daughter is my biggest fan,
she's always at the olympia,
she always wants to be there
and i won my first show
where my wife and my daughter
were together there watching us,
and that was amazing,
you see the girls crying,
because they are so
happy, it's amazing.
you know, in japan,
nobody really
challenged it before me.
i thought i was going to
be the first one really
to challenge the top.
i want to prove that bodybuilding
is not all about size.
it's a dream for every bodybuilder
to stand on the
stage for mr. olympia.
it was my dream.
it was my dream,
and i make it true.
everybody can make it
true if you want it.
from brooklyn, new
york, comes a predator.
ladies and gentlemen, kai greene!
when i was younger
i'd leave the cold
institutional facility,
go to a bodybuilding show,
and i'd stand there on stage
with athletes, teenagers,
that had people at home
invested in seeing them succeed.
you'd hear a very proud mom or pop,
sitting in the third or fourth row
and then there was
you, no mom, no dad,
there's nobody gonna be
sitting in the audience,
proud of you, but you were proud.
you took pleasure in
beating those guys that did.
he's your reigning and
current mr. olympia,
"the gift," phil heath!
they only nitpick the best.
they only criticize the best.
they do!
in all sports, they do.
because it's hard for someone
to say, "he's just perfect
and we'll never talk about him".
they have to say something!
did they announce it?
- did they announce the top 10?
- no.
i'm just gonna go.
as i call you out, that
means you're in the top 10,
if you need to go see
pro tan, get greased up,
go down and do it, then
we'll get you up there.
in numeric order,
please, gentlemen.
can i have branch warren,
tony freeman,
johnnie jackson,
evan centopani,
lionel beyeke,
dexter jackson,
shawn rhoden,
dennis wolf,
kai greene,
and phil heath.
once again, branch, tony,
johnnie, evan, lionel,
dexter, shawn,
dennis, kai and phil.
that's our top 10,
thank you, gentlemen,
we should have you on
stage in roughly 20 minutes.
roelly, sorry, brother.
fuel for next year, baby!
come back next year.
all right, let's bring out
our top 10 back on stage.
gentlemen!
hey, we've got one more call.
i need phil and kai back.
that's gonna be it, group.
okay, now.
quarter-turn to... no,
wait, hold on, stop it.
no, wait, stay back on
the line both of yous.
and do me a favor, take
two steps to your right.
do me a favor, take a
step apart from each other,
there's plenty of room.
gotta stay on the
same side, come on,
a little bit of room between yous.
come on, phil, take one
more... yup, thank you!
okay, now, front.
front double bicep.
come on now, front double bicep.
and relax.
relax, front lat spread.
okay, both, front lat spread.
and relax.
either side for side chest.
and relax.
back double bicep.
and relax.
face forward.
your favorite most muscular.
and relax... and relax.
okay, thank yous very much.
this concludes our
confirmation round.
all right folks, here we go.
are we ready for the awards?
aileen, please take
the sixth-place award
to our sixth-place finisher.
dennis "big bad" wolf!
the fifth-place award,
branch warren!
the fourth-place award,
"the blade," dexter jackson!
the third-place award,
"flexatron," shawn rhoden.
and now, ladies and gentlemen,
in olympia tradition,
kai greene, phil heath,
center stage, please.
ladies and gentlemen, we
had a one-point decision.
ladies and gentlemen,
the next name i announce
will be the winner of
the 2012 mr. olympia!
come on, baby!
when i did find myself in
institutional placement,
the cold, oppressive
feeling of, like...
like you don't matter
and you may never,
ever, ever matter again.
i began to talk about competing
in the olympia one day.
i really did not develop plan b.
but i didn't, i didn't.
i didn't just talk
about it, it's like...
i really believed that
it was gonna happen.
phil heath!
ladies and gentlemen,
mr. olympia, phil heath!
i didn't get any sleep, trust me,
over the past 48
hours, because i knew
that these guys were all champions
and i knew they were bringing it.
man, it feels freakin' good
to be king up in here, man.
i can't even lie.
did you feel nervous for a
second, like it was close?
did you feel at any point nervous?
i think i was more
nervous yesterday.
'cause i felt that
after the first round,
i thought it was lights
out, and i kinda eased up
off the gas, and that
kind of allowed kai
to get more confidence
and to start making up
ground on me, and it showed.
i mean, i could tell.
and it was like the
power was going to him.
well, today i realized
what his game plan was,
and i just figured, i
gotta let it all hang out.
this is my town, this is my show,
this is my title,
this is my throne.
and i refuse to give it to anybody.
they're gonna have
to fight me for it.
i know that i pushed
him to his best look,
and i knew i'm gonna go
against their biggest punch,
but like i said, wait
till i punch back.
what's next for phil heath?
what are you gonna do?
we're gonna party tonight, man.
we're gonna party.
the title was within his grasp.
a point away.
the smell of victory
teased his nostrils.
you know, no one's
gonna give you anything.
you gonna have to work for it.
i didn't come there
expecting gifts.
i came there willing
to work for it.
and i believe that any man
that is willing to
work hard and labor long
can attain the goal, as
long as it's realistic.
i've seen enough
feedback that lets me know
that this is not unrealistic,
it's not impossible.
we got a chance to
see the champ bleed.
and he bled.
he's still bleeding.
whatever can be forced to
bleed against its own will
can be killed, it can
die, it can be beaten
and you know, um...
we got more work to do, you know?
we got more work to do.
