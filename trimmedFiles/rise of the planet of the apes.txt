hey, okay ...
now...
let's go again.
which one's this, number9?
- yeah, number 9.  bright eyes.
are you watching this?
this, this is unbelieveable.
oh, my god.
oh, my god.
how many moves was that?
- 20.
the perfect score is 15.
god, what, what are you giving her?
hey, give me that video!
chimp number 9, just one dose.
couldn't i see you later?
- we're good to go.
i'm going to call you back. yeah,
all right.  thanks, bye.
on just the one primate?
- one is all we need.
full cognitive recovery.
we're ready.
look, are you sure you're
not rushing this?
i've been working on this for
five and a half years.
the data is clear.
we're ready, steven.
all i need is your approval
for human trials.
oh, for this, you're going to need
the board's approval.
there's a lot of money riding
on this, will.
you only get one shot.
- one shot is all i need.
[sighs]
all right. i'll need to see
all the research.
you got it!
oh, and will ...
- yeah?
keep your personal emotions
out of it.
these people invest in results,
not dreams.
okay!
meet chimp 9. here she's tasking at
what is called the lucas tower.
the object of which is to move the tower
from peg to peg
without placing a larger block
on top of a smaller block.
as expected, she was unable
to complete the puzzle at all.
then, we gave her what we call,
alz-112, a gene therapy
that allows the brain to create its
own cells in order to repair itself.
in biology, this is
called neurogenesis.
here, at gen-sys,
we call it a cure to alzheimer's.
donnie, you get her ready?
- she's got stage fright.
is that what it is?
hey, ape.
she's gonna break my arm!
bright eyes!
let go!
are you all right?
we're ready to move
on to the next phase.
human trials.
here you go, bright eyes.
it's your favorite fizzy soda.
come on, let's go, donnie.
we should have her downstairs already.
okay. good girl!
come on out, girl, that's right.
that's for you.
got her!
jesus!
donnie, open the cage!
open up! open up!
going to sedate her!
no, no!
- get the door!
no, no! hold it! now!
call help! donnie, donnie!
there have been absolutely no side
effects associated
with 112, with one exception.
for some reason,
the chimps irises exhibit
flecks of green.
actually, we first noticed it in chimp 9,
hence her nickname, bright eyes.
you'll see when we bring her in.
move!
in theory, this therapy
can be used
to treat a wide range
of brain disorders.
it's virtually limitless.
as are the potential profits.
which is why we are confident that
you will vote to approve human trials.
no, no, no!
mr. jacobs, mr. jacobs i am begging you,
i am begging you, not to do this.
look, it costs a small fortune to
run lab workups on all of those chimps
only to tell me what i already know,
that they are contaminated.
there are lives at stake here.
these, these are animals
with personalities,
with attachments.
attachments?
- yeah.
i run a a business,
not a petting zoo.
find the most cost effective way
to put those apes down.
i can't do that.
you're the chimp handler.
handle it.
steven!
well, that was fun!
they've taken the 112.
board has rejected your proposal.
they've chosen to advance other programs.
well, there must be something
that you can do.
yes. there is, i could fire you.
believe me, we talked about it.
we have five years of conclusive data.
parade all the data you want,
you will never convince anyone
to invest another dime.
this drug has the potential
to save lives!
bankrupt this company, more like.
i swear, you know everything
about the human brain
except the way it works.
go back to the drawing board
on the 112.
start again in
molecular development.
find a way to get there
before someone else does.
and, clean up this mess.
franklin!
it's very small. she must have been
pregnant when we brought her in.
so that's why ...
she wasn't being aggressive.
she was just being protective.
she thought we were going to
hurt her baby.
i would take it myself,
but my brother-in-law works for security.
he'd rat me out in a seceond.
what, you want me to take it home?
i can't take care of a monkey.
he's not a monkey! he's an ape.
- franklin ...
you know, it's just for a couple days until
i find a sanctuary.  that's all i need.
franklin, no!
look, this isn't my responsibility.
this, this is company property.
okay ...
i tell you what, doc.
jacobs made me put down the other 12.
i'm done.
be my guest.
hey!
- oh, hi.
you look beat.
- yeah. how's he doing?
well, he has good days and bad days.
today, not so good, although he
has been quoting shakespeare.
oh, you got a pet?
uh, it's just a temporary house guest.
well, maybe that'll be good for him.
good night!
[discordant piano playing]
hi, dad!
dad?
will! i didn't hear
you come in.
today's the day, right?
you thought i'd forget?
you have a big test today, right?
chemistry?
hey, dad ...
you want to see something?
- what?
what is that? is he injured?
no, i think that's a birthmark.
"as for caesar, kneel down,
kneel down and wonder!"
yeah, don't get too attached.
he's a cute little guy, isn't he?
where's my car keys?
my car keys, where'd you put 'em?
dad, ... you a, you don't drive anymore.
i know that.
here ...
why don't you feed him.
can you do that?
of course, i can..
will! ... look at this!
how old is he?
like, a day old? two days old?
yeah ...
he's a smart one, isn't he?
what are you going to name him?
i do not know ...
three years later
right away, caesar displayed signs
of intelligence heightened intelligence,
so i kept him.   and, brought
my work home.
by 18 months,
caesar was signing up to 24 words.
by age two,
caesar completing puzzles and models
designed for children
eight years and up.
at age three,
caesar continues to show cognative skills
that far exceed
that of his human counterpart.
home ... home.
he completed the lucas tower in
i maintain my hypothesis that:
a. the green in his eyes indicate
that the alz-112 was passed
genetically from mother to son
and, b. that in the absence of damaged
cells that need to be replacing
the drug in his system has radically
boosted healthy brain functioning.
and, ...
he plays chess pretty well.
[shouting]
dad!
i'm sorry.
- i can't do this, anymore.
he belongs in a home.
this is no way for him to live.
no way to live?
i broke my lamp ...
it'll make you better, dad.
[shhh...]
dad!
dad!
[exuberant piano playing]
todd, come inside for breakfast.
i'll need to keep track of
what i take from the lab,
although i don't see you needing
more than one treatment a month.
something amazing has happened!
i'll need a blood test,
a scan and the dosage ...
carefully monitored.
now, if i can sneak ...
will!  i'm not sick, anymore!
it was nothing, dad.
ceasar.  where's caesar?
i want to see him.
caesar!
caesar!
he can't have gone far.
caesar!
daddy!
caesar!
get out of here! get out!
get out!
hey, hey, hey ...
enough! enough!
it doesn't matter what you do.
if i catch that animal anywhere
near my house or my kids, again ...
he's not dangerous.
it won't happen again.
damn right, it won't!
come on, dad.
- he, he just wanted to play.
stay in the house!
daddy's got you.
i told you not to go out without us.
it's okay ...
how bad is it?
i do not know.
he likes you.
- uh, huh.
don't worry. it'll be over soon.
then, we can go get a treat.
i'm thinking, ice cream.
good idea!
you taught him to sign?
just, handful of things, basic stuff.
what's he saying?
nothing.
so, when do you think we should come back?
well, you won't need to come back.
because, um,
the stiches are dissolveable.
i would just say, watch for
signs of infection.
fever ... redness ...
okay, what's he saying, now?
um,
well, ...
he thinks that you and i should
have dinner together.
(chuckling) i ... know ...
caesar! come on!
good to see you, again, caroline.
you coming, caesar?
so, what's your secret?
oh, i can't take any credit.
it's in his genes.
i think you're being very modest.
he's pretty amazing.
i think you've built a pretty good
home for caesar, here.
you know he won't stay this way for long.
he's going to soon grow into
a large, powerful, animal.
come here!
how's he been doing?
okay, i think.
i love chimpanzees.
i'm also afraid of them.
and, it's appropriate to
be afraid of them.
caesar will never hurt anyone.
he's happy here.
yeah, i see that.
we can at least give him some open space?
- yeah. that would prpbably be a good idea.
i know a place right across the bridge,
the redwoods.  it's a paradise.
come on!
come here.
doesn't need a leash!
he'll be fine. come on!
just to be safe.
- come on, caesar!
it's the redwoods.
caesar!
all right.
if i take this off you can
not leave my sight.
i'll never find you again.
okay.
what's this?
- what's he doing?
i don't believe that!
- what?
he's asking your permission.
it's a supplicating gesture.
it's okay.
come on, caesar!
off you go!
look at him go!
caesar!
caesar!
caesar!!
- caesar!!
caesar!
there you are ...
caesar!
come on, caesar, climb!
go higher!
climb!
be careful!
caesar, be careful!
five years later
hi!
what's going on, buddy?
give some love.
come on, honey.
is that a chimpanzee?
[dog snarls & barks]
come on!
come on!
[caesar snarls back at dog]
[dog whimpers]
caesar! ... caesar!
come on!
it's all right. come on.
come on!
let's go.
are you getting in?
caesar ...
you okay, pal?
are you pet? ... no.
you're not a pet.
i am your father.
what is caesar?
okay ...
caesar, this is where i work.
this is were you were born.
your mother was here
with other chimpanzees.
but she's not here, anymore ...
so ...
... that's why i took home
to live with me.
yeah.
your mother's dead.
the thing is, she was given medicine,
like the medicine i give to charles.
she passed it on to you.
that's why you're so smart.
let's take him home.
come on, explain it to me.
all right.
i snuck him out of the lab
to save his life.
i had no idea that the effects had
been transfered vertically from his mother.
but, since then, he's been displaying
incredible signs intelligence.
i designed the 112 to repair,
but caesar's gone way beyond that.
here's his iq from last year.
since then, it's doubled.
this is all wrong.
my father was on gone
this drug brought him back.
you never saw how bad he was.
he has his life again.
and, what about caesar?
- what about him?
how does he fit in?
with me, ... with us ...
listen, ...
i know it has been hard for you,
but you are trying to control things
that were never meant to be controlled.
the 112 works.
do you realize how you sound?
all i'm saying is
this is a good thing.
caesar's proof of that.
so's my father.
caesar, eat your food.
dad, are you okay?
yeah, i'm fine.
antibodies.
his system has found a way
to fight the 112 virus
so that it can't deliver
its therapy.
my father's disease is going
to return with a vengence.
stop!
stop, right now!
hey! get out there!
get out of that car!
what the hell are you doing?
get out of my car!
i said, get out of my car!
i'm a pilot! i've got to get
to the airport!
how am i gonna get there now, huh?
answer the god-damn question!
what were you doing?
i have a car just exactly ...
i'm done ...
the police can handle it.
stay right there!
you aren't going nowhere, mister!
you will pay!
this is your problem,
you make it happen!
... not through with you!
stay right there!
caesar, stop!
daddy!
caesar!
it's okay.
it's okay.
he didn't mean it.
it's okay ...
hey, hey, take that thing off of him!
take that thing off of him!
look, i'll take him in, okay?
no, he's under court orders.
we can't do that.
it's fine! let him.
bring him in when you're ready.
take it off.
thank you!
caesar, caesar, caesar,
... caesar, caesar.
not right now.
it's going to be okay.
let's just see what it's like
inside, okay.
come on, caesar.
let's go.
come on, ... trust me.
it's okay.
go.
he hasn't spent any time with other chimps.
oh, we're used to that.
he'll be a little skittish at first,
but we'll integrate him.
you'd be surprised
how quick they adapt.
we provide a stimulating environment.
he's going to thrive here.
come, let's do some paperwork.
make sure you lock that door
when you come in.
caesar!
you'll be okay!
everything's going to be okay!
don't be scared.
you're going to stay here, now.
no ... not going home right now.
it's ok.
the longer you drag out the good-byes,
the harder it is.
can i sign that later?
you'll probably miss him more than
he'll miss you.
you'd best give him a couple of weeks
to get used too the place.
will, we have to go.
we have to go home.
coming back soon, okay?
just call ahead, before you do.
hey, over here!
hey, i can get you out!
come on!  over here!
hey, down here.
stupid monkey ...
so you? come on, make it!
court order hasn't been filed,
so it's not in the system.
once it comes through,
it will take about 90 days before
you receive an appeal date.
- yes, sir, 90 days.
you'll be notified by mail.
here's what's going to happen.
you're going to go back to your computer,
you know, shift things around
and you're going to get me a date for
my appeal, this week, you got it?
i can't help you.
all right, then we have a problem.
because, i'm not moving until you do.
you're talking about court dates.
you're lucky they
didn't put that animal down.
i promised to get him back
soon, dad.
dad?
my father's immune system
continues to reject the 112 virus,
rendering the gene therapy obsolete.
his health is deteriorating,
and the disease is progressing rapidly.
i need a more aggressive virus strain,
a faster delivery method,
because at this rate ...
i can't lose them both.
i won't lose them both.
hi .... can we talk?
make it fast.  i've got a meeting.
the ten years you have been
running gen-sys,
how many drugs have come down the pipeline
that could save millions of lives?
that could change everything?
what are you talking about?
the alz-112.
what happened to you, will?
you used to be the star of this lab.
now, you hardly ever show
and when you do, you waste your time
and that of your team's
fixating on a drug
that, after what happened,
is never ever going to get approved.
the 112 is dangerous, will,
and it doesn't work.
i treated my father with it.
it does work.
you did, what?
you did, what!?
beat the disease, like we predicted.
brilliant.
there's been a complication.
well, does it work or doesn't it?
my father's disease eventually
outran the cure.
oh, for goodness sake.
the immune system produced antibodies
to beat the viral component,
but it will work.
i've have already developed a virus strain
that i think will be more aggressive.
you think?
just, let me test it.
you're wasting my time.
there's more!
the applications go beyond the disease.
there are indications that show the
therapy can improve cognitive functioning,
memory quality ...
what, what are you saying?
my father didn't just recover.
he improved.
you mean, increased intelligence?
it's not conclusive, but yes.
i want you, to start testing the
revised 112 on chimps, a-s-a-p.
okay.
i'll give you whatever you need,
but get started.
dinner time!
great ape, primate!
go on, don't you know food
when you see it?
you think that's funny, huh?
i show you something funny!
you'll learn who's boss, soon enough.
what about his clothes?
what about 'em?
i don't know ... may cause problems
with the other apes.
good!
i counted ten apes, correct?
yep.
good.  all the way to the back.
you guys are moving really quick on this.
what's the big rush?
first day back,
you're still complaining.
koba. hi, i'm will.
this one.
he's very calm.
yeah.
he's been through a whole lot of labs.
he knows the drill.
could i join you,
what's our progress.
get him prepped.
tighten your masks.
pass me the 113.
pulse-ox is good,
blood pressure is steady.
perisol delivery, in place.
releasing the 113.
we have a break!
franklin, get your mask on!
got it?
yeah.
you okay?
yeah, okay.
move it!  let's go!
get up and do some exercises
you lazy baboons!
intelligence results are remarkable.
there are no adverse effects.
apes have amazingly strong
immune systems.
all right, keep an eye on him.
okay. [franklin sneezes]
sorry about that.
these guys are more resiliant than i am.
excuse me a second.
he's good.
you're working late tonight.
gen-sys needs three more.
hey, caesar!
are you hurt?
show me.
caesar, give me your hand.
give me your hand.
sometimes, the new kid on the
block gets picked on.
stay calm. what did they do?
that's bullshit!
what's the problem here?
i'm taking him out of here, right now.
not without a court order, you're not.
he's not yours, anymore.
i promise, if i find out he's been
mistreated in any way,
i'll have this place shut down.
go on ...
no.  no, we're not going home,
right now.
i'm going to get you out of here,
i promise.
you have to trust me.
caesar, you have to trust me, okay?
i think this visit's over.
trust me.
you'll be okay.
come on, move it!
let's go!
there are hundreds of them!
looks like you're own private zoo!
rather like a prison
for hairy dudes.
they watch tv?
we call it enrichment.
aw, this one's so cute!
what's his name?
uh, name's cornelia. it's a she.
[shreek]
oh, my god!
don't get too close!
this one scared me half to death.
that big guy is called, maurice.
it's no fun.
here, i'll show you something fun.
check this out!
it's crazy!
you shouldn't be in here.
hey, you're next!
come on, let's go.
we spent too much time in here,
as it is.
come on!
check out this guy.
hey, alan, he's a pain in the ass.
he thinks he's special, or something
freaky!
hey, come here.
i think he's thinking or something.
oh, my god, he's got him by the throat!
let him go!
let go!
are you okay?
yes.
i told you not
to get too close, man.
come on, guys, let's get out of here.
some things aren't meant
be changed.
you need to accept that.
hey!
hey!
what's going on here?
more 113 trials.
we're just prepping ...
oh, no, we have to analyze
koba's blood work first!
franklin knows this.
where is he?
he's out sick for two days.
well, i didn't authorized this.
no!
i did.
we agreed to test sparingly
on one subject.
and, that one subject is stunning!
it's a virus. we don't know the human
related effects.
the drug works, will.
tell him, linda.
for starters, koba scored
a perfect 15 on the lucas tower.
every test result verifies
its effectiveness.
no more tests.
- what are you ...?
not until we have a better understanding
of what we're dealing with.
look, i'll tell you exactly
what we do. look ...
give us a minute.
excuse me!   put the ape
back in the cage. be gentle.
will, i'll tell you exactly what
we're dealing with, here.
we're dealing with a drug
that is worth more
than everything else
we are developing, combined.
you make history,
i make money.
isn't that our arrangement?
- no! there are risks.
don't you tell me about risks.
you give your own father
an experimental drug.
i could finish your career
with one phone call.
i'll save you the trouble. i quit.
we will proceed without you.
look ... you do not know what you're doing.
these tests need to be contained.
you have no idea if the 113 is stable,
what kind of damage it can
do to people ...
well, that is why we test it
on chimps, ... isn't it?
dr. rodman, it's, me, franklin!
i need to talk to you!
can you come to the door?
doc!
[coughing]
who the hell are you?
[franklin sneezes on neighbor]
get out of here!
i'm sorry, ... i'm sorry.
you wouldn't be trying to entrap me,
would you?
well, ... i can't say that i approve.
they're not people, you know.
you gonna to let him go or not?
caesar, ... hey, come on.
come on, we're go home.
home.
come on, we're really going.
let's get out of here.
yeah ... come on.
caesar?
i guess he likes it better here
with his own kind.
damn it, rodney,
you leave the hose out in
the atrium, again?
what?   no!
come on!  let's go.
come on, get up!
[on tv] eight months after its launch,
earth's first manned space flight
to mars ...
i ain't dodging.
i'm telling the truth.
yeah, well, if i've didn't
take the cookies,
then, who the hell did?
i, i do not know ...
hey!  will you two morons
knock it off!
i'm going home.
[on tv] ... covered in water and
therefore able to sustain life.
i get more peace in the
god-damned ape house.
dad, i'm sorry!
mr. franklin, it's dottie!
mr. franklin? ... hello?
what the hell?
[over radio] rodney, get to the
platform, now.
[over radio] rodney!
what the hell do you think
you're doing, huh?
get!
go on!
get back in your cage!
i'm warning you!
go on, get!
that's it!
that's what you get! ... get back!
what's wrong with you?
dumb monkey!
take your stinking paw off me,
you damn dirty ape!
no!
no!
no!
no!
no!
i'll beat all!
caroline, have you been up to
caesar's room?
no one's answering.
landon!
will!
will!
what happened?
he spoke.
what are you ... what?
your ape ... he spoke.
what in the hell?
i don't believe this.
[video] i'll beat each and
everyone of you.
i need someone to coordinate
with the s.f.p.d.
tell them we got a fatality.
what is it?
i know where he's headed.
glenn?
let's go!
jacobs.
[cell phone] mr. jacobs, it's linda
from will's team.
look, something terrible
has happened.
franklin is dead
from a viral infection.
what the hell are you
talking about?
he was exposed to the 113.
it does something
to people that it doesn't
do to apes.
we'll have to go through the city
and across the bridge.
[cell phone] mr. jacobs?
mr. jacobs, are you ...
what the hell?
i am steven jacobs!
it's full of apes in there.
i gotta get in the air!
we have to be able
to destroy them.
just, trust me on this!
okay?
you might want to get your cameras
ready.  normally,
these guys are quit shy.
they're going  the park,
on the north side!
find the lead!
you gotta hold the button!
the button!
they're being led.  these apes
are smarter than you think.
they've got a leader!
do not tell them i am stuck in traffic.
make up with something smarter!
hold on.
what the ...
they're on the bridge.
they're trying to get to the redwoods.
sfpd, police 1.
this is air ops,
[on radio] seal of south end.
what's the status of those units?
[radio response] ready to go, sir.
[on radio] as soon as they reach you,
block them.
[on radio] north side, we're going to push
them right to you.
[radio response] no problem.
we're ready for them.
the north side is blocked.
[on radio] they'll never get through here.
as soon as they hit the gap,
we'll take them out!
you can just shoot them?
like shooting fish in a barrel.
good!
turn that thing around!
get off the bridge, sir.
i can't ...
you don't understand.
get off this bridge, now!
this is an evacuation.  get out!
all the civilians, clear.
[on radio] please confirm.
