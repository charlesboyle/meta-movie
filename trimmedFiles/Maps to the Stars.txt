winds up doing as an hbo show.
what's this place?
i thought it might be on a star map.
there used to be a
really big house here.
childhood home of benjie weiss.
so, how do you know that?
i used to babysit for him.
i was the original bad babysitter.
it's weird.

jacob lightner...
... got it to me...
he's a personal manager.
he's a real heavy-weight.
we went to beverly together.
i hold my fingers crossed.
hi, there.
i'd didn't think you'd come.
why is that?
you're so busy.
not for you.
hm.
i, um...
i... i liked 'bad babysitter'.
you were so funny.

sorry about that.
- what the fuck is non-hodgekin's?
- i think it's a blood thing.
i mean, 'non'.
it either is or isn't.
were you serious in there?
because...
... we can definitely get this to ryan.
- it's just the kind of stuff he likes to do.
- we could get it to ryan?
yeah.
you can barely get
toilet paper to your ass.
make for an uplifting drama,
wouldn't it?
i mean, i even got a title.
'it's a horrible life'.
if you're not serious benjie,
it's better not to promise.

great rabi, death and dieing.
man of wisdom.
zen-fucking-archer!
i got a new nickname for you.

i was listening to a very interesting tape
of the dalai lama on the way home.
say what you like about politics....
... the <i>man</i> is a pro.

tibet is not free.
tibet is very expensive.
i have the receipt
from amazon to prove it.
anyhow...
buddhists say a prayer...
is genie gonna be there?
she thinks it's better not.
i want her there.
pray... that those that eat...
... the things that are eaten
and the actual eating...
... be universally devote herself.
don't you love it?
i'm going to my room.
goo-goo-ga-joo.
<i>don't mama...</i>
don't mama...
<i>don't hurt me like that. </i>
don't hurt me like that.
<i>don't come into my room. </i>

when i'm sleeping.
<i>- i won't let you anymore. </i>

you... you hurt me.
how?
how did i hurt you?
i was your little girl...
i was your...
i was your little girl.
and... and you hurt me.
why did you do it, mama?
because your parents hurt you?
that's not good enough!
that's not good enough!
come on, havana, stop forgetting!
i don't...
i don't care what they did to you.
i wish they'd... killed you.
i... i'd kill you myself, mama.
how... how could you
do that to a child?
how could you do...
what you did to me?
i want to be free clarice.
i want to be free.
clarice, mama...
mama, mama.

i will be free.
we will take back the years you stole.
please...

i'm gonna press on a
personal history point.
everything is stored in thighs.
okay.
take back the years, havana.
take back the years she
stole from that little girl.
release.
rebeca, we need to stop.
you're a patient here.
i want to help you,
not make you things...
you don't think i set
those fires, do you?
i think that you didn't mean to.
you need help.
that's all.
don't you wanna help me?
not like this.
i think that we need to
think about what we're doing.
on all the flesh that says yes.
on the forehead of all my friends.
on every hand held out.
i write your name.
ms. havana?
it's ms. genie.
- how you doing, baby?
- eh, i'm okay.
i really had a session with stafford.
that is so brave, what you do.
doesn't feel brave.
i need a new chore whore.
what do ...
what happened to adaggio?
ahh... i had to fire her.
you're kidding!
what happened?
she was stealing.
adaggio?!
oh god, i don't believe it.
yeah, yeah. she took some money
and a ring i got last year in paris
and some vicodin.
oh my god!
- what did you caught her?
- um.-hmm.
so what did you call the police?
yeah, i told her i would
if she didn't go to rehab.
i see that she's there now, huh?
yeah, with the all the other
dope fiend personal assistants.
they have there own wing.
okay, well, i call carry again.
um, love her, love carrie
but don't bother her with this shit!
she'll think it's hilarious.
i'm meeting her later at the j.j. thing.
she'll give me some names.
so, umm...
what's going on with 'stolen waters'?
well, i called vita but you know,
they're all at sundance.
yeah, everyone but me!
i gave the best reading
of my life, genie!
i went in there and
i blow everyone away!
i know, i know.
i mean, you know,
the only thing i can think of was that
they maybe they have some concerns
about the perception of stunt casting.
everything is stunt casting.
havana...
... this is a movie and not a great one...
... that your mother made.
no, no.
but it could be... it could be...
great! it's a , it's a re-imagining.
it's a fucking art film!
i mean, who do you think
came up with the idea of
my mother looking back on
the making of 'stolen waters'
if she had lived?
i did. i did!
i mentioned it to damien
i know, i know.
they should give me the part.
and, and a producers credit too.
i mean this role was...
... made for best supporting. it's...
it's... it's a fucking second chance.
and it's, it's damien javitz.
he totally resurrects actors.
and i went in there and i killed it.
sterl still doing it?
yeah...
yeah, he owes me.
i introduced him to harvey and
you know harvey is producing and i mean,
i already talked to harvey and
he's gonna to talk to damien
but you know...
harvey is harvey, but...
sterl can talk to damien?
you know we are doing
everything we can but
you know, at the end of the day,
it's an art film.
i mean it will be great if you got the job.
but in case you're not aware
your mother is a dead cult figure.
a damien javitz.
i mean they're so many movies out there!
yeah, where?!
- big deal movies!
- where?
where? where genie?!
do you know what jacob said
to me the other day?
he said that because
i know so many celebrities
i should consider becoming a manager!
do you know,
do you know how it felt
for me to hear that?!
look, everything i am doing
everything in my life
and in my therapy is to get this part...
- ow!
- what's wrong? what's wrong?
- ow, cramps.
- are you okay?
no, not okay!
mother daughter incest
is so 80's overkill.
and sexton i am not.
oh my god. oh my god!
the shock will wear off.
what's the matter, havana?
did you think it would be
like the 'sixth sense'
with the dead clambering to be heard?
do you know what the dead clamber for?
you know what hell is?
a world without narcotics.
what's happening?
what's happening?
worst pornographically shaven at this
childhood rape fantasy.
get a life!
maybe you should get a dad.
isn't it pathetic enough
that you want to play me?
you hate me.
that yet you are desperate to be me?
you want that role
that you're not gonna get.
you don't even have the chops.
i did.
and i was young and gorgeous.
you?!
with your shitty tits and
that used up old hole!
it stinks worse than me!
no! no...
who is it?
it's non-hodgkin's.
what are you doing here?
on my school notebooks.
on my desk, in the trees.
on the sand, in the snow.
i write your name.
i'll... i'll make the movie.
if that's why you're here.
i don't know what marlon told you...
on all the flesh that says yes.
on the forehead of my friends.
on every hand held out.
i write your name.
in my school notebook.
on my desk and on the trees.
on the sand and
in the snow, i write your name.
on all the flesh that says yes.
on the forehead of my friends.
on every hand held out,
i write your name.
liberty.
so, we're back to school with 'bad babysitters'.
is this detention?
no way, you're top of the class.
we understand you had
a rocky summer vacation.
unproductive one.
wasn't easy.
for any of us.
but he's learned a lot.
absolutely.
yeah, listen, i went through
that whole drug thing myself.
i mean... not at your age.
like you but... shit happens.
right, it just ahh...
... happens a lot earlier
than it used to.
benjie's done a lot of growing up.
yes, he has.
uh, on the last season of
'prince lords' i was making
i was 9 years old.
how psychotic is that?
crazy money.
for anyone
but worth every penny.
you've got a tremendous
fanbase out there.
i just didn't have the skills.
that kind of income
would fuck up mother teresa.
she's already fucked up.
she's dead.
that's how fucked up she is.
we have a mandate.
christina knows this and i,
i know you do too.
we have to protect the franchise.
goo-goo-ga-joo.
only kept things quiet last year.
arnold, your people were terrific.
nothing from the tabloids.
yeah still...
you know, an adult recovery can be a career boost but
with a child it's something else.
i think we understand that, chip.
though, ah, it didn't hurt drew.
hm?
guys...
we're on your side.
please understand that.
i don't think we'd all be in this room
if didn't feel a certain level of trust.
do we have a budget yet?
ah, 58,
but that's strictly in house.
yeah, we lost elle but, eh,
she's not someone we were counting on.
we're closing with emma watson
for the young mom so uh...
that should be fun.
we need to know the
circumstances of benjie's rehab.
uh benjie...
detox in a private home.
the ranch of my husbands partner.
kick-ass mom you got there.
um.
she knows how to hit
without leaving marks on the body.
fuck.
i will never be humiliated like...
... like that again.
never.
it's over, baby.
we have them.
did damien told i was too old?
mm-mm.
the casting people.
sarah horowitz?
havana, come on.
the part's just written younger.
sarah horowitz cast me
in my very first movie.
mm.
probably saw that
thing i did on tnt for money.
yeah, well, don't do anything for money.
yeah, well we all haven't
been as smart as you.
you gonna support me on this, sterl?
are you gonna support me with damien?
look, you know i will.
i think he's taking
a hard look azita wachtel.
azita wachtel?
well, she's nominated
for an oscar and she's canadian.
canada is co-funding.
do you know that azita wachtel story is?
do you know what she's known for?
she used to let producers stick
their cocks in her ass and pee.
good to know.
look, you have a relationship with damien.
yeah, i've 3 calls in to him
but he won't return.
you gave a great reading.
he tell you that?
he said you were very strong.
he did, he said that?
yes.
oh my god!
oh, sterl!
i have to get this part!
we'd be so great together!
why, i thought we already were?
diandra?
oh my god! she's old!
hey, did you know she's like 23?
i heard that she's 16.
how do you know she's 23?
her labia is pierced.
you gotto be 23 to
have your labia pierced?
now she's got a
tramp stamp... okay, she's
menopausal!
hey, nice girls, huh?
oh my god. 
oh, bet you won't believe this.
no, nah, no,
it's too fucking weird.
- i'm not going to this.
- now i'm getting interested.
okay, so there's this crazy girl, right?
she's posted like 6000 messages on my
facebook fan page in like 2 months.
sounds like marriage material.
you should just fuck her, right?
or eat her on her period.
come on, don't be vulgar.
yeah, bri won't even do that to me.
well he can't.
because your menopausal!
- oh!
- shut up!
- come on, we...
would you guys chill,

production company looks into it and
finds out a teenster's been selling this chick
my shit for like 3000 dollars.
excuse me, your shit?
yeah, you heard it right girl, my shit.
he's got some expensive doody.
it's got rice in it from uh...
noboo!
like out of a honey wagon?
no, like...um... when the guy
comes in with the hose
.... empty...you know...
what is she doing with it?
stock pilling... for that rainy day.
okay, like, where did she get the money?
slush fund.
oh! benjie you are so sick!
there are some days, i actually,
i ran specials when i had diarrhea.

starla gent, country singer.

- nah, she's runner up.

javitz cast her in the part you wanted.

ah, i wonder if
blake sheldon pied in that butt.
hey, you like sam?

she wants to be in your movie.
i hear she gets great oxy too.
i've almost got 90 days.

sobriety, you dick-wad!
oh, my god!
the human stench.
fat, anchor whore from tnt
was in the bathroom. we saw her ankles.
what was her name again?
it was like something dead farted.
hey, isn't that sterl carruth?
oh yeah, with havana segrand.
we have the same agent.
how old is she?
totally menopausal.
oh, beyond! she's near death!
she's like older than my grandmother.
oh, she is. she milf.
grandmother i like to fuck.

ah, she'd be like a mercy fuck.
like when orderlies rape
old people in nursing homes.
hey, didn't her mom die in a fire?
yeah!
like jack cassidy.
who's that?
the prodigal swinger.
david cassidy's father.
who's david cassidy?
sean cassidy's brother.
you know her mom was
really cool actress as well, um...
... clarice taggart?
yeah, um...
annie did a thing on her.
she was really cool!
she was young.
who is that?!

hey, damien, what's happening?
yeah, yeah, i could totally wear 2 earrings.
i love that.
um, maestro, i'm just, eh...
i'm just here with the kids.
doing the whole bedtime story thing.
can i... can i call you back?
um, yeah, no, i'll, yeah,
i'll call you right back first thing.
hey!
mention me when... you talk!
you are so fucking crazed.
suck my dick and i'll put in a word.
i loved you so much.
you were such
a beautiful little girl but you lied.
how could you grow up
to be a monster who lies?
fuck.
hey!
what's happening?
i'm sorry, it's...
i just got uncomfortable.
i guess i'm a lousy dyke.
why don't you take a klonopin?
i know a man...
... who lives under the sword of damocles...
... we call aids.
'when my time comes', he told me...
i'll be ready.
my bags are packed
and at the door.
i like that.
i like that very much.
there is a time in
our lives and in out therapies
when out eyes stray
to the bags at the door.
after we wept.
after we have suffered.
after we have exhausted the fountain of memory.
bloodied our hands.
in the walls of our parents house.
i thought that
gary marshall was gonna be there.
and it was a meet.
i didn't know i was gonna have to read.
and then they gave me
the wrong drive-on and i had to walk like a mile.
and i stank by the time i got there.
and then the casting director, who i know
doesn't even acknowledge me.
she just walks right by
without saying a word and...
... and then she tells me...
she doesn't even know if
gary even knows i'm coming in.
you know this is gary marshall,
not berdalucci.
his movies don't make
money any more and i know gary.
and then she says they
want to put me on tape
and i'm like, excuse me but
you need special make-up for that
or you look green and she says
well you can either tape or not!
like it's all some pointless exercise and
i just can't take it anymore, jacob!
i'm so tired and it's so pathetic!
is that carrie?
later jacob. they're here.
hi carrie!
how are you?
oh, when i get in touch with
myself i'll let you know.
it's been insane.
did you rap?
well, we go back to prague
tomorrow to do re-shoots.
are you doing the javitz film?
oh, i hope so.
did you hear something?
well, genie told me you were up for it.
that would be so amazing
for you to play your own mother.
i mean...
every daughter should have
that opportunity, right?
do you know damien?
well, we just...
had dinner once in tangeers.
well, if you see him,
tell him to hire me.
oh, genie told me about adaggio.
eh, how long did she work for you?
are you still looking for a new assistant?
absolutely, you've become
my employment agency.
would you do me a big favor?
this is gonna sound bizarre but...
would you interview this girl
that i met on the internet?
i'm so nervous.
naw, it's okay.
do you like some tea?
oh, thank you, yes.
your house is so beautiful.
walls are so thick and those chimes.
oh, their from a monastery
in dharamsala.
i met the dalai lama.
he's very cool man.
he laughs a lot and he's...
actually just like someone you
wanna hang with, you know?
but, you can't cause
he's the dalai lama!
thank you for the tea.
marie is at the hospital.
my housekeeper.
one of her girls is sick.
she's got like, you know, 40 kids.
so...
i guess you know why you're here.
mm, because of carrie.
how did you guys start e-mailing?
well, she wrote on twitter that she was
researching for a
new novel she was writing.
about a burn girl so...
i wrote to her and then i met her
at a star wars convention in florida.
was that weird for you, i mean...
she's so amazing.
you know, she's such a funny, amazing person.
plus we both have dual disorders,
we finish each others sentences.
so you came out here to see her?
i just wanted to see hollywood.
but she said she'd take me to
breakfast at the 4 seasons.
zooey deschanel was there.
and sally draper,
the little girl from mad men.
it was pretty amazing.
do you have family?
in florida, that's where i'm from.
agatha, um...
can i ask about the burn?
ah...
i was working in
a planetarium after school...
i was 12.
there was an electrical fire and
i ran into a store room.
like a jerk...
mm.... um... well...
this isn't a very glamorous job.
i'm not used to glamor.
mm, you'd be like
mostly running errands, going shopping
and getting things fixed and...
ms. segrand, i would be
the most loyal, most competent,
most grateful personal assistant
you've ever had.
you don't have a car?
but you drive?
i have a valid florida license.
mm, we can rent you a car.
i think maybe...
mustang, or something.
carrie's so funny.
she knew i should meet you.
do you know how my mother died?
no.
in a fire.
oh.
agatha.
i think you're beautiful.
and do you know
who looks just like you?
inside?
havana segrand.
we got a request.
what is it?
hollywood tour. cash call.
holly prest hotel.
on my school notebook.
on my desk and on the trees.
on the sand and in the snow,
i write your name.
on all the flesh that says yes.
on the forehead of my friends,
on every hand held out, i write your name.
liberty.
so you were in a fire, right?
you know, i never really
figured out what happened.
i think, one night i got drunk and
slept really hard on my face.
so, now you hit tinseltown,
what are you gonna do?
can't ah...
... keep riding around in limos
if you want to keep your money.
actually, i got a job.
oh yeah, where?
do you know havana segrand?
sure. know of.
i'm her new personal assistant.
that's the...
carrie fisher connection?
actually it was.
havana is getting me a car.
hey, do you wanna have
dinner on the weekend?
um...
yeah, this weekend is
not good for me i have to ah...
... i have to work on my script.
i have a great idea for a movie.
maybe we could write it together?
it's got an incest theme i guess
those are kinda of overdone, huh?
sex abusing your religion.
the truth is my parents
are brother and sister.
i never tell anyone that.
but i think it would be corny.
it's like, been there, done that.
i know that sounds jaded but
i think it would make a cool indie.
you know, i want to act in it.
and you could too.
mm...
think it would be good
if it wasn't pretentious
you know if we got the whole
mythological thing going on.
uh, look agatha...
think you're a little crazy.
well, so...
i mean...
what i'm saying is um...
i'm kind of,
kind of involved with someone.
and uh...
i mean...
hope everything works out for you.
look i don't want to take your money.
fuck you.
it was...
... like a dream but
it seemed so fucking real.
go on.
a girl... i ah...
met her at the hospital.
we sent her an ipad but
they said she died.
then...
... she came into
my room at the house.
scared the shit out of me.
maybe it was a dream.
am i going crazy?
no.
well, i...
think it's probably time for you to
start talking about certain things.
my sister?
yes.
she always, ah...
... wanted to...
... marry me.
that's how we played.
we did the ceremony.
isn't that strange?
think i'm crazy like her?
no.
but...
... if we don't look at things
they can make us crazy.
mom and dad were...
... at some party...
i was 6 or 7 then.
that night...
... the night it happened...
... we uh...
... had the ceremony, the marriage thing.
and uh...
... she gave me pills...
... vitamins she said...
... and uh, i woke up in the hospital,
they pumped my stomach and...
... the firemen...
... carried me out there...
... and i never saw her again.
- maybe you asked your parents if they had...
- i did.
they don't talk about her.
they won't.
the girl at the hospital...
harriet...
... what do i do?
what do i do if she comes back?
you call me.
i'm afraid.
whenever i see her, it's so...
... real.
i don't want to be hospitalized.
my career is so fucked as it is.
textbook tss havana.
you saw heavy combat as a child.
could i be a multiple?
i don't see that but if you are,
we'll deal with it.
damn her!
what does she want?
when you came out of hiding and
externalized your shame...
... mother didn't like that.
but what we can name,
we can tame.
she wants me to fail.
- but i won't.
- i won't.
that's
little havana.
celebrate her.
the imago deity,
that's what jung called it.
we call it...
... the magical child.
and that child, will not fail.
lay down.
i hired a girl.
it's amazing.
why is it amazing?
she's disfigured.
she was...
... burned in a fire.
on her face...
where is she from?
florida.
it's amazing. she just...
... showed up on my doorstep.
i get this sense that i'm...
... working through something
by hiring her.
people don't just enter
our lives randomly, we call them.
two women linked by fire.
i bet those visions go away.
oh... god!
do you think so?
you're welcoming
mom into the house.
you're saying 'hey, mom'.
'come on in'.
'you don't scare me.'
'i'm empowered.'
'soup's on'.
'this is my house, ma'.
'i build it with my pain and my hope'.
'and you can't hurt me anymore'.
'i'm a magical child, ma'.
'so, come on in'.
'mi casa'
'es su casa'.
deep breath now, havana.
breathe.
what if she comes to the house?
she won't.
then what is she doing here?
maybe she is sightseeing.
why are you so cavalier about this?
we've always handled
things differently you and i.
you got to get her fired.
and then what?
she's working for havana.
we know where she is.
and that buys us time.
what if she tries to get to benjie?!
i'm concerned about the tabloids.
i'm about to go on a
book tour, for christ sakes!
in my school books.
on my desk.
in the trees.
on the sand, in the snow.
<i>i write your name. </i>
<i>on all the flesh that says yes.</i>
<i>on the forehead of my friends. </i>
<i>son?</i>
one second!
come in.
saw your light.
i couldn't sleep.
me neither.
were you reading?
just building up on the script.
that's hard to do without a partner.
mom usually reads for me but um...
... i like to know lines pretty well
before we go over them.
that's what makes you pro.
listen there's something
i wanted to talk to you about.
i'm not taking anything.
not even seroquel.
i've got a really good sponsor.
he's been clean and sober for 20 years.
he's worked with robert downey jr.
- demi levato.
- no.
it's about your sister.
we think she may be back.
here in los angeles.
did... did she call?
she hasn't yet.
thought she was in prison somewhere.
hospital.
far away.
but... now she's...
free, wild and 18.
courts couldn't hold her.
we're in the process of acquiring
a restraining order against her.
- and i like you to tell me if she...
- a restraining order?
too bad you couldn't have gotten
one when she was born.
you could've had a judge
standing by in the delivery room.
maybe you tried that.
we tried a lot of things, benjie.
mostly we tried our best.
that's in your book.
that's a big thing in your book.
trying your best.
it's supposed to give people major points.
i don't know that girl anymore so...
not that i ever did.
<i>i don't know if she is dangerous.</i>
<i>i knew this day was coming.</i>
i thought somehow she'd just stay put.
that was stupid... of me.
but i want you to tell me...
... if she tries to see you.
i'll tell you if she pops up.
you know, me and you,
like to share.
get some sleep son.
by the power of the word...
... i renew my life.
i was born to know you.
and to name you.
liberty.
<i>havana, sweetheart, i've...</i>
<i>i don't know if you've
read the trades, but um...</i>
<i>they unannounced that
damien went with azita.</i>
<i>i mean i can't say it's a
complete surprise but uh...</i>
<i>i'm very angry at the way it was handled.</i>
<i>i mean it...it... it just makes me
look foolish.</i>
<i>but that's my problem not yours.</i>
<i>i'm so sorry, honey!</i>
<i>i have calls into damien.</i>
<i>and i hate to be leaving
this on your phone, i...</i>
<i>i... i just didn't want you to
hear it from someone else.</i>
<i>as you know i mean i strongly think
there's no love lost on this project.</i>
<i>those were always my feelings.</i>
<i>i know and i respect the reasons
why it was so important to you, but i...</i>
<i>i think it's of equal importance
we put this behind us.</i>
<i>so... onward.</i>
<i>i'm messengering 6 scripts</i>
<i>to the house now!
lots of great stuff on the horizon.</i>
<i>call me as soon as you get this!</i>
<i>i love you!</i>
<i>and it's gonna be a great year!</i>
made a hole in the wall.
so we'll be able to see everything.
- everything?
- or your money back.
oh boy! i want to see her va-bina!
and... cut!
mr. va-bina's getting all the laughs.
he's only in 4 scenes.
yeah and he's stealing every one of them.
piece of shit.
would you call genie?
call genie and tell her i want
the little piece of shit flushed.
and... what are you doing here?
i...
i wanted to talk to you about something but,
you know, it could wait.
not the studio's drug paranoia again?
no, not the studio and their drug paranoia.
<i>ready for you benjie!</i>
fuck off!
i need something to eat.
my blood sugar drops every time i do
a scene with mr. piece of shit va-bina.
oh... ma, can you put one of those
breakfast burritos in the microwave.
hey.

i'm cool.
thought you'd be working on your script.
i wish i was.

your mother was so special.
it's gonna be a challenge for me.
uh, i don't want to do impersonations.
do you know who's gonna
play my mother when she was young?
anne...
... hathaway.
how's that gonna work?
oh, oh, you'd love anne.
do you know her?
she... she's amazing.

it's asinine and i'm sorry.
it's just...
... i'm nervous around you.
it's sounds comical but
i'm not used to being around people.
i'm not gonna listen to this.
those incidents you keep
sharing on the talk shows...
... they're falls memories.
liar!
from day one, liar!
your stepfather must have done
those things to you.
why couldn't i see it?
his first wife warned me
that he was like that.
you must have been so angry
at me for not protecting you.
stay away from me.
stay... stay away.
you blame yourself for
the night i burned, don't you?
this is my house, ma.
i built it.
my pain and my hell.

<i>hello?!</i>
the door was open!
what's happening?
this hasn't hit the news yet.
what?
azita wachtel's little boy...
... died.
no!
i just saw them!
um... he was with his dad, in ohi.
- and he drowned.
- my god!
micah! how?!
in the pool...
- and she wasn't there?
i don't know, i mean, nobody knows yet.
anything.
but here's what's going on.
and i know it's schoolish...
but i think we can get you to replace...
but how?
well azita is in the hospital.
you know.
she totally lost it.
they had to sedate her.
um... won't they just shoot
around her for a few weeks?
there's no way she's going back to work.
how much have they shoot?
there's no way she's going back to work.
how much have they shoot?
eh, just a few days.
casting people called me.
sarah horowitz? she call back?
yeah... they want to make an offer.
did damien call?
no, but you know,
he's probably consumed.
well,  but, havana...
they are not gonna make an offer
without damien's complete approval.
no. ah... azita should just... do it.
she should... she should work.
she should go to the funeral and
then go right back to work.
yeah i know, it's beyond but
do you still want to do it?
i need to talk to damien.
you will!
but this just happened.
i haven't been able to reach anyone.
don't go deafen my quote ,
cause if they're really in trouble, we're in the capital seat.
unless they're out to somebody else.
i'll call you as soon as i hear.
should i send flowers?!
you're not supposed to know!
and save the flowers to damien,
when we close!
ciao!
na-na-naa-na!
na-na-na-naa!

excuse me?
i'm looking for jerome fontana.
he had a callback?
he's a vorbalit?
try make-up.
hey!
what are you doing here?
havana is having lunch at the commissary.
thought i'd see if i can find you.
is it supposed to be a burn?
no, i don't think so. i think uh...
... it's a birthmark or something.
we're half an hour away.
go back to make-up and
get some color on that thing.
they did have a cover... for the pool but...
the motor was in the shop for repair.
he didn't swim?
the father heard the phone...
and he thought it was azita
so he went inside for like
that's always how it happens,
i mean, uff, thats...
always how you hear it happens.
mm.
have you talked to azita?
uh, yeah, i went to see her.
she's home now.
i told her you were playing her part.
she was relieved. 
at least she seemed to be.
i felt weird.
going in there to tell her...
... that. but we had become close.
anyway, listen, i... i was...
i was going to call you.
to tell you about my decision to go...
... with azita but things went crazy.
yeah, it's cool damien.
i'm... i'm totally fine.
yeah... i'm not.
i don't like the way...
... that that was handled.
i loved your read.
you know that.
i had some initial misgivings about...
... the connection to your mother.
but...
... the film, that i'm making...
... is very different from the original.
in fact, in some ways
it does not resemble it at all.
which i would probably be
taking it to task for it.
the script is amazing.
thank you.
you know, i just want you to feel strong.
coming in like this.
things happen for a reason.
i'm a big believer in that.
so glad to have you on this show.
benjie?
hey, victoria lap in star! channel,

i prefer if you didn't tell them i stopped by.
i'm not a big fan of closures so...
if you're looking for an epiphany
that's gonna help you go on with your life than...
i wrote to you...
... for years.
to explain.

this is hard.
no shit. did you?
but i didn't want anything to happen to you.
do you know about them?
about who we are.
did they tell you?
pills?
- vitamins?
- probably something for sleep.
so you gave me pills and then
you set the house on fire?
why am i having trouble with the
'i didn't want anything to happen with you' part?
- i was seeing things!
- like what?
children.
what'd you do when you uh...
... when you saw them?
i would say...
... by this ring,
you are consecrated to me.
i remember that's... that's...
that was the game we played.
it always worked.
as soon as i said it,
they always went away.
okay, uh, i think you have to go now.
benjie...
there's this script.
i can't explain but you are part of this
beautiful mythological script.
oh my god.
my long lost psychotron sister
is pitching me a movie.
agatha, leave.
and take the dvd with you.
you don't have to worry
about me starting anymore fires.
they blew my pile lighter right out.

- no...
- bad idea. going to see benjie.
reckless.
a question remains.
why are you in la?
i'm in recovery.
i wanted to make amends.
no one escapes
the long arm of 12-step.
why didn't you ever come and see me?
that's a victim question.
that's, and i never promised you
a rose card question.
<i>you know why.</i>
i don't believe in rewarding.
homicidal behavior.
i've changed.
i wanted to tell you how...
how sorry i am for what i did.
i wanted to tell you and mother.
i sent letters.
apology's accepted.
you need money?
no, i have a job.
i'm working for havana segrand.
she asked if i knew you.
here.
here's 10 000 dollars.
i want you to get on a plane, that would be true amends.
our lives are rich and full.
we made them from the ashes of what you left.
give ms. segrand a notice.
father...
please.
don't ever think about seeing
benjie again or christina, do you understand?
you can't have actually believed i would let you
come back and fuck up my world again?

his father thinks you could
have done something to save him.
that's what father's always think.
i'm not doing this.
go play with somebody else.
i'm alive, asshole! i'm alive!
and i'm not crazy!
i know a man...
... who lives under the sword of damocles.
we call aids.
'when my time comes' he told me.
i'll be ready.
my bags are packed and at the door.
i like that. i like that very m...

we have to stop.
you're a patient here.
i want to help you.
you're a patient here.
i want to help you.
you don't think i set those fires do you?
say, 'i think that you didn't mean to.
you just need help, that's all'.
think you didn't mean to.
you just need help, that's all.
don't you want to help me?
will you leave my stockings?
i have burns.
my legs. my stomach. my back.
okay.
on my school notebook.
on my desk and on the trees.
in the sand and in the snow,
i write your name.
on all the flesh that says yes.
on the forehead of my friends.
on every hand held out,
i write your name.
<i>your mother of course
was clarice taggart.</i>
<i>the wonderful actress who died
tragically in a fire in the mid 70's.</i>
<i>christmas '76.</i>
<i>you've spoken of your mother's addictions.</i>
<i>and recently revealed and,
very bravely, i might say,</i>
<i>that you yourself
were physically abused.</i>
<i>and sexually, yes.</i>
<i>which is far more uncommon, usually it's a male,
the father, stepdad, what have you.</i>
<i>and i wanna talk
about that havana, but first...</i>
<i>there is a question that
i've been dieing to ask.</i>
<i>what is it like</i>
<i>starring in a remake of a movie,
'stolen waters', as you are now</i>
<i>and essentially</i>
<i>playing your mother?</i>
<i>scary.</i>
<i>i mean, we all hear that
we become our mothers but</i>
<i>this is a bit extreme.</i>
<i>and she was even nominated?</i>
<i>for an academy award, yes,
which i believe she should have won.</i>
<i>but she did get the golden globe.</i>
<i>i suppose i feel about as
comfortable as i, as i could.</i>
<i>- we're very lucky to have damien javitz directing...
- agatha!</i>
<i>- there is a man who's made some...
- agatha, could you come up here?!</i>
<i>strange films. honored?
yes, but strange nonetheless.</i>
don't be shy.
i'm so backed up from the vicodin.
i need you to go back to
whole foods and get me a laxative.
i think it's called 'quiet moment'.
i need you to go back to
whole foods and get me a laxative.

you mother fucker!
you idiot!
oh god!
holy shit!
oh fuck! fuck!
- get out of here benjie!
- rhett, man, i'm sorry! you saw... i...
i had all the bullets out.
you're fucking crazy.
you killed my dog, asshole!
you sick mother fucker! you killed my dog!
get out of here!
may i come in?
- i'm not sure that's a good idea.
- i won't stay long, mom.
i just wanted to make amends.
i've seen this house in the magazines.
in ah...
architectural digest and the profiles of father.
makes me feel exposed but...
stafford likes things personalized.
show the world how and where we live.
can i...
... get you anything?
um, no thank you.
i suppose it'll quit.
actually i thought
you'd come here sooner, it...
it's been 7 years.
takes me that long to
put on my make-up.
agatha, i... i didn't go to see you.
i wouldn't have come to
see me if i were you either.
i was afraid.
cause of what you did.
you don't have to explain.
i've dreamt so much of that old house.
it was the first place i visited
when i got back here.
it's so strange that nobody has built on it.
well we still own the property.
since before i can remember,
i've had the same dream.
benjie and me, getting married there.
in a big white tent.
i didn't make any sense.
and then i found out
about you and dad.
you were in europe, i...
... found a key to the lock box,
all the pictures.
we didn't know we were
brother and sister.
we've been separated
since we were kids.
it was a freak thing, we...
... met on campus, in the desert...
agatha, we didn't know.
we didn't know.
what are you doing here?
stafford, it's alright.
i told you to stay away from us.
you didn't know.
it was a freak thing.
i found the diaries.
love is stronger than death.
- you crazy cunt!
- stafford!
- daddy no!
get off her!
okay.
okay.
- gotto go! gotto go!
- don't take her!
- gotto go!
- don't take her!
- don't take her!
- let me go!
my ring.
she took my wedding ring.
my ring.
piss patrol!
caught in the act.
you know...
you're chewing some major
scenery out there.
- what do you mean?
- you know what i mean.
va-bina head!
who's the star of the show?
huh?!
can you tell me that, roy?
uh... you are?
he's not your enemy.
you!
love is stronger than death.
you're... a bad babysitter, benjamin!
you die!
die!
you're a bad babysitter!
fuck.
fuck!
fuck!
he maybe groggy
from the medication.
oh.
oh my baby! my baby!
my baby! my baby...
i'm so sorry, mom.
why?
benjie, why did you do it?
he was just a little boy...
i saw her and...
who, baby? agatha?
did agatha come to see you?
little girl.
she tricked me.
what little girl?
from the hospital.
the one that died.
i keep seeing.
oh, my baby!
my baby! my baby!
oh my baby! oh my baby!
oh my baby! oh my baby.
we've got to get him home.
i'd like to place him
outside of california.
we need jonas to speak
with the district attorney.
he's only 13.
we have to factor in
the violence of the assault, christina.
he didn't take a gun to a kid at school, harriet!
he hurt one boy. one boy!
the state's become
very tough on minors.
they won't send him to jail?
they won't send him to jail.
boy's gonna be alright.
oh, thank god!
they've shut down production.
i don't know if
they are gonna recast.
but it's such a small little part, what?
benjie!
they are talking about recasting benjie!
- my god.
- it's over!
done!
now the whole world...
... will know.
the world will know
we have done crimes.
hope you don't mind
that i requested you.
no, i'm glad.
god!
i feel shitty.
i think i've got bronchitis.
kind of makes your voice sound sexy.
thank you.
so, how's the romance going?
it's alright. it's pretty good.
what's that all about for you?
- what do you mean?
- well, you know...
... the burn thing?
was it creepy...
... to fuck her?
uh, not really.
did she take her gloves off?
do your friends think it's weird?
have your friends even met her?
i've kind of tried to...
... try to write a script about it.
research.
everything is research on some level.
mm.
would you fuck me if i asked you to?
for research?
i don't know.
how would we do it?

from behind.
we could if you want.
