that's a funny one.
isn't that funnier?
it's hysterical, manny.
<font color="#804040">harry</font>: as long
as we're laughing...
we won't cry
over the box office.
talk about depressing.
twenty girls in feather boas
prancing around like circus ponies.
that's depressing.
i love a good chorus line.
what's this? it's a play.
who wrote it, annie?
some guy. driscoll.
driscoll.
from the federal theatre.
don't knock it, honey. at
least they got an audience.
it'll pick up. isn't
that right, manny?
it always does.
<font color="#804040">maude</font>: see you tomorrow.
the trick is to start to build right
from the back of your throat.
<font color="#808080">(sneezing)</font>
works well
out through the nose, too.
have you eaten today?
oh...
i'm not hungry. don't
worry about me.
hey.
you're all i've got.
come on, take me to dinner.
okay.
you think the kitchen
will still be open on third?
soup and biscuits. perfect.
<font color="#808080">(people protesting)</font>
harry, what's going on?
hey, open up! we work here.
not anymore, lady.
it's all right for you. we haven't
had a paycheck in two weeks.
how we gonna eat?
they're not getting away with this!
they just did.
ann, it's no use.
the show, it's over. it's done.
i'm done.
i'm leaving, annie.
i'm going back to chicago.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry, annie.
ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.
you gotta think of yourself now.
you should try
out for that part.
oh, i know what you're thinking.
every time you reach
out for something you care about...
fate comes
along and snatches it away.
but not this time, annie.
not this time.
oh, hello, mr. weston. oh, jeez.
look, miss, i told you
already, call my office.
leave your résumé
with my secretary.
now, why would i want to do that when
we can talk about it in person?
because that's what a smart
girl would do.
but i already sent you my résumé.
you returned it unopened.
what can i say? jack driscoll's very
particular about who he works with.
please, just an audition.
that's all i'm asking.
jesus, you don't
give up, do you?
mr. weston, i know
this role backwards.
well, that's too bad, 'cause we just
gave the part to someone else.
i'm sorry, kid.
the play is cast.
i know times are tough.
you want my advice?
use what you got.
you're not bad-looking.
a girl like you doesn't
have to starve.
there's a new place.
it just opened.
now listen, princess, this gig
ain't the palace, you understand?
ask for kenny k.
tell him i sent you.
just play the date,
take the money...
forget you was ever there.
<font color="#808080">(film projector whirring)</font>
how much more is there?
another five reels.
lights up.
<font color="#804040">investor</font>: this is it?
this is what we get
for our $40,000, denham?
another one of your safari
pictures?
you promised us romantic scenes
with bruce baxter and maureen mckenzie!
come on, fellows,
you know the deal.
we agreed to push
maureen's start date...
so she could get
her teeth fixed.
it's not the principle
of the thing, it's the money.
carl, you've been in production
for over two months.
trust me, bruce and maureen
are gonna steam up the screen...
once we get them on the ship.
what ship?
the one that we hired
to get to the location.
what location? carl! you're supposed
to be shooting on the back lot.
yes, i understand that.
but, fellows, we're not
making that film anymore...
and i'll tell you why.
the story has changed. the
script has been rewritten.
life intervened.
i've come into possession
of a map.
the sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.
a place that was thought
to exist only in myth.
until now.
whoa, carl, slow down.
is he asking for more money?
he's asking us to fund
a wild goose chase.
i'm talking about a primitive
world never before seen by man.
the ruins of an entire
civilization.
the most spectacular
thing you've ever seen.
that's where
i'll shoot my picture.
will there be boobies?
boobies?
jigglies. jiblonkas. bazooms.
in my experience, people
only go to these films...
to observe the undraped
form of the native girls.
what are you, an idiot?
you think they asked de mille
if he would waste his time on nudie shots?
no! they respected the filmmaker.
they showed some class.
not that you'd know
what that means, you cheap lowlife!
would you step
out for a moment, carl?
<font color="#808080">(sighing)</font>
<font color="#808080">(phone ringing)</font>
<font color="#804040">receptionist</font>: zelman
and associates.
give me that, quick.
you won't like it.
it's non-alcoholic.
preston, you have a lot to learn
about the motion picture business.
<font color="#804040">zelman</font>: don't write him off, fellows.
he's hotheaded, sure...
but carl denham's made
some interesting pictures.
he's had a lot of near-success.
he's a preening self-promoter.
an ambitious no-talent. the guy's got
"loser" written all over him.
<font color="#804040">zelman</font>: i understand
your disappointment...
♪ <font color="#804040">investor 1</font>: he can't direct. ♪
♪ he doesn't have the smarts. ♪
♪ <font color="#804040">investor 2</font>: he's washed up. ♪
♪ it's all over town. ♪
this jumped-up
little turd's gonna bankrupt us.
the animal footage has value.
sure. universal are desperate
for stock footage.
then sell it! scrap the picture.
we got to retrieve something
from this debacle.
get him back in.
mr. denham.
i want the cast and crew
on the ship within the hour.
no, carl, you can't do this.
tell them the studio pressured
us into an early departure.
it's not ethical! what
are they gonna do, sue me?
they can get in line.
i'm not gonna let
them kill my film.
you realize that none of the camera
equipment is on board?
we have no permits, no visas.
that's why i have you, preston.
we have no insurance, we have
no foreign currency.
in fact, we have no
currency of any kind.
he's there.
get in there. who's gonna
pay for the ship?
get in.
you get out of there! come here!
step on it! step on it!
get out! you're
finished, denham!
<font color="#808080">(gasping)</font>
don't worry, preston. i've had
a lot of practice at this.
i'm real good at crapping
the crappers.
<font color="#804040">preston</font>: red label, 80% proof...
to be packed in a crate
marked "lemonade."
<font color="#804040">carl</font>: you got it.
tell maureen she doesn't have
six hours to put on her face.
if she wants to be in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.
she doesn't wanna
be in this picture.
maureen pulled out.
she pulled out?
yesterday. i told you.
you said we were shooting
in singapore, right?
that's what you told her.
yeah, but we're not
shooting in singapore.
god damn it, preston, all you had to do
was look her in the eye and lie.
i got to get to a phone,
talk to harlow's people.
she's unavailable.
myrna loy? clara bow? mae west?
<font color="#804040">scoffing</font>: you'll never get
her into a size four.
you gotta get a girl that'll fit
into maureen's costumes.
fay's a size four.
yes, she is, but she's doing
a picture with rko.
cooper, huh?
i might have known.
you're not listening. we
got to delay the shoot.
shut production down.
we can't sail tonight.
not an option. carl.
i said i'd find a girl.
for god's sake, preston,
think like a winner!
call jack. i need
that goddamn screenplay!
defeat is always momentary.
what?
<font color="#808080">(people chattering)</font>
hey! you gonna pay for this?
excuse me.
ma'am, i think you dropped this.
vaudeville, huh?
i worked vaudeville once.
that is a tough audience.
if you don't kill them
fast, they kill you.
mr. denham...
i want you to know...
that i'm not in the habit
of accepting charity from strangers.
or, for that matter...
taking things that don't
belong to me.
it was obviously a terrible
misunderstanding.
it's just that i haven't
been paid in a while.
that's awful. anyway, ann...
may i call you ann?
you wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?
no, no. oh, god, no.
you've got me all wrong.
miss darrow, please.
i'm not that type
of person at all.
what type of person are you?
i'm someone you can trust, ann.
i'm a movie producer.
believe me, i am on the level. no
funny business. please sit down.
please. please.
okay.
ann, i want you to imagine...
a handsome explorer
bound for the far east.
you're filming in the far east?
singapore.
on board ship, he meets
a mysterious girl.
she's beautiful,
she's fragile, haunted.
and she can't escape the feeling
that forces beyond her control...
are compelling her down a road
from which she cannot draw back.
it's as if her whole life has
been a prelude to this moment...
this fateful meeting
that changes everything.
and sure enough, against her
better judgment...
she falls in love.
yes.
but she doesn't trust it.
she's not even sure
if she believes in love.
uh...
really?
if she loves someone,
it's doomed.
why is that?
good things never
last, mr. denham.
so you're interested. good.
that's settled, then.
now, i don't wanna rush you,
but we are under some time pressure.
well, i really... ann,
i'm telling you...
you're perfect. look at you.
you're the saddest
girl i've ever met.
you're gonna make them weep, ann.
you're gonna break their hearts.
see, that's where you're
wrong, mr. denham.
i make people laugh,
that's what i do.
good luck with your picture.
ann? miss darrow, please!
i'm offering you money.
adventure, fame, the thrill
of a lifetime, and a long sea voyage.
you want to read a script?
jack driscoll's turning
in a draft as we speak.
jack driscoll?
sure. why?
wait. you know him?
no, not personally.
i've seen his plays.
what a writer, huh? and
let me tell you, ann...
jack driscoll does not want just
anyone starring in this picture.
he said to me, "carl..."
"somewhere out there is a woman
born to play this role."
and as soon as i saw
you, i knew.
knew what?
it was always going to be you.
<font color="#808080">(ship horn blowing)</font>
- <font color="#804040">jack</font>: how much do i owe you?
- <font color="#804040">driver</font>: make it a quarter.
keep the change.
is this the moving picture ship?
not exactly.
it's actually this
one over here.
don't let appearances deceive you.
it's much more spacious on board.
is this all of the equipment?
yeah.
this is all of it? yeah.
we're taking the bell & howell?
yeah.
good. you got all the lenses?
sure.
<font color="#804040">preston</font>: carl! yes!
get it on board,
fellows, come on.
it's bad, it's bad.
they're on their way.
i've just had word.
who? men in uniform.
the studio called the cops.
englehorn! cast off!
hoist up the mainsail,
raise the anchor...
whatever the hell it is you do.
we gotta leave!
i cannot do that.
we are waiting on the manifest.
what? who? english, please.
paperwork, mr. denham.
i'll give you another $1,000
to leave now.
you haven't given me
the first $1,000 yet.
can we talk about this later?
can't you see we're
in the company of a vip guest?
ma'am.
ann darrow.
so you are ready for this
voyage, miss darrow?
sure.
nervous?
nervous? no.
why? should i be?
it isn't every woman
who would take such a risk.
why don't i show miss
darrow to her cabin?
wonderful idea.
thank you, preston.
miss darrow, if you
would just...
hi. my name is preston.
carl's assistant.
$2,000. it's a deal.
will you take a check?
do i have a choice?
please follow me.
if there's anything that you...
excuse me, fellows.
if there's anything that you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.
oh, jesus! jack, you scared me.
listen. if anyone comes to the door,
don't open it. you haven't seen me.
say i got depressed
and committed suicide.
say i stuck my head
down the toilet.
you want one? no.
i can't stay, carl.
i got a rehearsal for which i am
now three hours late.
what's this? it's the script.
this is a script?
jack, this is 15 pages.
i know, but they're good. you've got
i'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.
you told me i had more time. i'm sorry.
look, i gotta go.
no, jack, you can't do this to me.
i have a beginning...
but i need a middle and an end.
i gotta have something to shoot.
look, you got my notes.
i got to go, pal. see you.
<font color="#808080">(sailors chattering)</font>
all right, fine. we might
as well settle up.
you're gonna pay me?
i'm not gonna stiff a friend.
i've never known you
to volunteer cash before.
how's $2,000 sound?
sounds great.
i thought it might.
sounds great. okay.

yes, and what i most admire...
is the way you've captured

well, that's my job.
i'm sure you've heard this

if you don't mind me saying...
but you don't look

he's so much younger in person.
and much better-looking.

out of his back.

off the first mate?
that's assuming she knows
who the first mate is.
come on, jack. it
was an honest mistake.
ann is nearsighted. it could
have happened to anyone.
i was joking, carl.
the point is, she's horrified.
she has to look away.
and that's when she sees it.
sees what?
what?
the island.
we're filming on an island now?
when did this happen?
<font color="#808080">(shushing)</font> jack, keep
your voice down.
i don't want the crew
getting spooked.
why would they get spooked?
what's it called?
all right. it has
a local name...
but i'm warning you, jack,
it doesn't sound good.
<font color="#808080">(whispers)</font> they call
it skull island.
did you get that?
what's wrong with this place?
there's nothing
officially wrong with it.
because, technically, it
hasn't been discovered yet.
okay. all right.
so we arrive at this place.
s...
k...
u...
i...
i...
island.
all right, everyone, from the top!
and action!
i think this is awfully exciting!
i've never been on a ship before.
and i've never
been on one with a woman before.
i guess you don't think much
of women on ships, do you?
no, they're a nuisance.
well, i'll try not to be.
just being around is trouble.
cut!
it's great.
bruce, wonderful performance.
you can relax for 10 minutes.
that was very natural.
i felt moved.
what do you think, driscoll?
dialogue's got some flow now, huh?
it was pure effluence.
i beefed up the banter.
try to resist that impulse.
it's just a little bit
of humor, bud.
what are you, a bolshevik
or something?
actors.
travel the world, but all they ever
see is a mirror.
good legs.
sea legs. well, you
know, sea legs.
yeah.
not that you don't have good legs.
just making conversation.
jesus. miss darrow!
about the scene today
with you and bruce...
i know it wasn't
what you wrote...
but mr. baxter felt very strongly
that when a man likes a woman...
he must ignore her.
and if things turn
really hostile, then...
no?
interesting theory.
i know. i should have...
it wasn't what i had
intended, but...
i'm sorry. i was...
and you made it your own.
i was nervous.
it was funny, actually.
you were funny.
please don't say another word.
good night.
miss darrow.
you don't have to be nervous.
thank you.
let's take it...
would you please... we're
trying to shoot a scene.
okay. thank you.
okay, again.
<font color="#804040">carl</font>: we're close.
turn southwest.
<font color="#804040">englehorn</font>: there's no land
southwest for thousands of miles.
it takes us way
outside the shipping lanes.
i won't sail blind
in these waters.
i'll make it worth your while.
there's nothing out there.
well, then
you've nothing to lose.
if someone were to tell you this
ship was headed for singapore...
what would you say?
i would say they're
full of it, mr. hayes.
well, we turned
southwest last night.
gentlemen, please.
we're not looking for trouble.
no.
you're looking
for something else.
yes, we are.
we're going to find
skull island.
find it, film it,
and show it to the world.
for 25 cents, you get to see
the last blank space on the map.
i wouldn't be so sure of that.
what do you mean?
seven years ago, me and mr. hayes
were working our passage...
on a norwegian bark.
we picked up a castaway.
we found him in the water.
he'd been drifting for days.
his ship had run aground
on an island way west of sumatra.
an island hidden in fog.
he spoke of a huge wall...
built so long ago...
no one knew who'd made it.
a wall 100 foot high...
as strong today
as it was ages ago.
why'd they build the wall?
well, the castaway,
he spoke of a creature...
neither beast nor man...
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.
a lion or a tiger.
a man-eater. that's how all these
stories start.
what else did he say?
nothing.
we found him the next morning.
he'd stuck a knife through his heart.
<font color="#808080">(laughing)</font>
mmm-hmm.
sorry, fellows. you'll have
to do better than that.
monsters belong in b movies.
if you find this place...
if you go ashore with your friends
and your cameras...
you won't come back.
just as long as you
understand that.
<font color="#808080">(shattering)</font>
how long do you expect
us to stay out here?
<font color="#804040">ann</font>: you're writing
a stage comedy?
i'm writing it for you.
why would you do that?
why would i write a play for you?
yes.
isn't it obvious?
not to me.
well...
it's in the subtext.
i guess i must have missed it.
it's not about words.
<font color="#808080">(morse code beeping)</font>
message for you, captain.
what's going on?
hayes, why
are we changing course?
englehorn, you can't just...
outside.
there's a warrant
out for your arrest.
did you know that?
i've been ordered
to divert to rangoon.
another week. i haven't
got a film yet.
please. i have risked
everything i have on this.
no, denham. you risked
everything i have.
what do you want?
tell me what you want.
i'll give you anything.
i want you off my ship.
<font color="#804040">englehorn</font>: set a course
for rangoon, mr. hayes.
i'm finished.
it's over for me, jack.
how'd you think this
would end, carl?
check our position.
use the stars.
there are no stars, captain.
<font color="#804040">jack</font>: what is that?
what? that.
that right there.
i don't know. what is it?
a coffee stain?
<font color="#808080">(ship's horn blowing)</font>
station the forward lookout and get
me the depth by lead line.
aye, captain.
reduce speed, steerage way only.
dead slow ahead, both.
you should stop the ship.
we're getting
out of here, mr. hayes.
we'll find clear conditions.
we have seabed!
we're shallowing!
captain, you don't know where
the hell you're going!
get me another reading!
another reading!
douse the lights. aye, captain.
wall! there's a wall ahead!
stop engines!

come on, move, move!
hayes! she's taken a pounding!
what about the prop?
the shaft's not bent,
as far as we can tell.
but she struck hard
against the rock!
<font color="#804040">jimmy</font>: captain!
better come up quick!
right there!
want me to bring them back?
i don't give a damn
about carl denham.
i want this ship fixed and ready
to float on the next high tide!
come on, move it.
we're leaving, mr. hayes.
can you believe this, jack?
<font color="#808080">(carl laughing)</font>
we've got our picture.
why does marlow keep
going up the river?
why doesn't he turn back?
there's a part of him
that wants to, jimmy.
a part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning.
but there's another part...
that needs to know.
to defeat the thing
which makes him afraid.
"we could not understand
because we were too far..."
<i>"and could not remember..."</i>
<i>"because we were traveling
in the night of first ages..."</i>
<i>"of those ages that are gone..."</i>
<i>"leaving hardly a sign,
and no memories."</i>
<i>"we are accustomed to look..."</i>
<i>"upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster..."</i>
<i>"but there...</i>
<i>"there you could look at a thing
monstrous and free. ".</i>
it's not an adventure story...
is it, mr. hayes?
no, jimmy.
it's not.
<font color="#808080">(wind whistling)</font>
it's deserted. of
course it's deserted.
use your eyes, preston.
the place is a ruin.
nobody's lived here
for hundreds of years.
<font color="#808080">(girl sobbing)</font>
<font color="#808080">(girl shrieking)</font>
mr. denham, i think
we should go back.
i will handle this.
look. chocolate.
you like chocolate?
it's good to eat.
you want?
take it.
here, put it in your hand
and take it.
<font color="#808080">(snarling)</font>
for god's sakes, denham,
leave the native alone.
she doesn't want the chocolate.

we gotta be grateful
for that, gentlemen.
what about mike? he didn't get away!
he's still there!
mike died doing what he believed in!
he didn't die for nothing.
and i'll tell you something else. i'm
gonna finish this film for mike!
i'll finish it...
and i'll donate the proceeds...

herbert didn't die for nothing.

in, and i'm gonna honor that.
he died believing there was still

a piece of it...
for the price

finish this film for herb.
we'll finish it...

was a great gal, no question.
and she was a wonderful person.
it's a terrible loss and we're

i just never figured
you for a coward.
