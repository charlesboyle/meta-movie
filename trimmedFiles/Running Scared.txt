<i>john wayne
in the cowboys.</i>
i don't like cowboys.
come on.
it's the duke.
come. sit.
when i was growing up
in kishinev,
we had no vhs,
no dvd back then.
i remember...
i did a job for
this friend of my father.
i pickpocketed a key
off this apparatchik.
the man gave me
as a reward
this children's
projector.
it came with 3 films--
<i>speedy gonzales,
tarzan of the apes,</i>
<i>and john wayne
in the cowboys.</i>
i watched that thing...
a thousand times.
anzor,
it's getting cold.
i was 9 years old.
i didn't know how long
movies were supposed to be.
<i>my version
of the cowboys,</i>
it was only
no john wayne
getting shot.
because it was for kids,
they left that part out.
i didn't know this...
until i arrive
in america
and see it on tv
for the first time.
i hate it.
i want
my 8-millimeter back.
because on that one,
the duke lives.
some things were better
in the old place.
not too many.
some things.
let me show you
from the beginning.
oh, no, no, no, no.
oh, go forward.
this part's better.
without the duke?
where are you going?!
you don't walk out
on the duke!
she said
he's always distracted
and he never finishes
his work,
and she wants
to get him tested.
wait, she wants
to get him tested?
tested for what?
i think maybe, uh,
attention disorder
or something.
i'm not
fucking a.d.d.
hey! you don't use that word
in front of your mother.
what's wrong
with "a.d.d."?
the other one,
smart-ass!
and he don't use
that word, period!
i don't want to be
on medication.
you can't make me take it,
'cause i won't.
no, no, nick. you know what?
don't even worry about.
there's no way in hell anybody's
gonna put you on meds, ok?
t, why don't you tell
that teacher
to come down to the rink
and watch him wax that puck?
that's perfect concentration
every time.
that's different, joe.
we're just--we're just
trying to find out
what's going on
with you.
ok? buddy, she said
some great things, too.
she said--she said
that he's very bright.
she said
he's very creative.
you left that part out before.
i like that part.
i got potential.
what are you doing?
you takin' a collection
down there?
he must eat.
the little prick...
insults the duke.
he don't eat
in this house.
you hear me,
you little snotface?!
stay in your room!
jerk off to
your fucking razors!
faggot!
he's a growing boy.
uhh!
<i>what did i
fucking say, suka?</i>
he has to eat, anzor.
please.
who puts food
on this fucking table?
uhh!
<i>not you, blyad.</i>
i'm the big man
of this house.
when i say the little shit
don't eat, he don't eat.
anzor.
john wayne was a faggot.
so, uh, vicki goletto
told me she saw you
walking hand-in-hand
with jeannie's daughter.

<i>you learn how to use that

<i>¡puñeta!</i>
<i>you got

let me see
your fingers, son.
is this--hey, hey.
is this your son?
i'm taking care of him
tonight, ok?
well, unless you have the name
and number of his doctor
and i can get a prescription
over the phone,
you're gonna have to
take him to emergency, ok?
now, if you want me
to call you a cab--
i don't need
no fucking cab.
i need some
spray shit for him.
well, that spray shit
happens to be
a controlled substance,
ma'am,
so what can i tell you?
keep the change.
i can't--this is stupid.
i can't do this.
listen, why don't we
go out in the back,
and we talk
about it, ok?
look, lady--
i'll take care of you.
there's nothing
i can do, lady.
there's nothing
you can do?
take him
to emergency.
ok.
ok...
nothing you can
fucking do?
get what he needs...now.
it's beclovent.
yeah, i know.
beclovent, bitch!
come on,
let's just go back.
no. no. if he turns up,
your mom's gonna call.
t.
sal.
yeah.
do girls really
get naked in there?
you'll find out
when you're 21.
i've seen mom naked.
it's no big deal.
trust me on this one.
it's always a big deal.
stay here.
put your hands together
for the sexy redhead...
galaxy.
what?
it's taken care of.
oh, it's taken care of.
lucky us.
guys, sit down.
have a seat.
don't be shy.
they make a good mai tai
for a twat bar,
but seriously
overpriced--
$2 million for
a round of drinks,
and the pussy
ain't even that hot.
hey, baby.
jodi, i'm doing
business here. jodi...
come on. get the fuck
out of here.
$2 million.
suck a dick,
you prick bastard.
you don't have
shit on us.
what do you think
of this?
the cops never found
these at the scene,
just 2 dead narcs
and 3 dead jamaicans.
ballistics
is going to reveal
that the slugs
that killed my partners
didn't come
from the jamaicans,
so there were
others involved.
as for myself, uh...
i was never there.
well, dead guys
tell no tales.
yeah.
why don't you ask
your pal here?
what the fuck
you talking about?
you blew my partner
stevie's balls off
with a .38 snub nose,
a real
distinctive piece--
stainless, polished up
like a spic's hubcap.
now, let me take
a wild guess here.
i think that
you gave him the gun
to dump in the river.
now, i'm assuming that
he never got around to it,
because 2 hours ago,
his next-door neighbor
took a slug in the shoulder.
the shooter was the guy's
who was over
at gazelle's house
what the fuck you
trying to do here?
huh? you trying to
fuckin' play us?
because you're wasting
our fuckin' time.
this is goddamn
fuckin' bullshit.
bullshit?
bullshit, huh?
this punk
anzor yugorsky,
he describes the gun
to me in vivid detail.
makes mention
it's a snub nose
with a serious
shine to it.
what the fuck is this guy
talking about, joey?
he's talking about
a fuckin' shiny gun.
big fuckin' deal.
there's a thousand
of them on the street.
it ain't
the fuckin' piece.
oh, yeah? what were you
doing at the hospital
when they brought
yugorsky in?
huh? sniffing around
emergency?
you know what i figure?
i figure you were there
to pull a switch
on the slug
they took out of him.
my wife asked me to go
to the hospital.
she was concerned--you know,
in a neighborly way.
she wanted me
to go to see--
all right,
you know what?
enough bullshit.
i expect to find
a bag in this locker
at dominic station
by midnight.
if the bag is not there
one minute after,
i'm taking you all down
any fuckin' way i can,
even if i have to
manufacture the case.
and you know i will,
because i got the toughest
mob in the world.
i'm the law.
all right, stay put.
i'm gonna grab you
a burger.
i'm not hungry.
yeah, but you didn't
finish dinner,
so i'm gonna grab you
something to eat.
stay here.
dad?
don't go in there.
let's just go home.
it's gonna be
all right.
no, it's not.
hey, frankie,
how you doing?
hey, how are you?
yeah, it's good
to see you.
sit, joe.
how you doing, guys?
hi, joey.
how you doing, man?
joey.
i'm fine.
you want some coffee,
something to eat?
nah, i'm good.
but, listen,
i got my boy, he's
waiting out in the car.
i want to get him
a burger or something.
tony, go and take care
of that, yeah?
yeah, tony,
get him some fries
and a strawberry shake.
and don't scare him.
he don't know you're coming.
so, joe...
i just got off the phone
with ivan yugorsky
about this thing
with his nephew.
i told you. it's not
the fuckin' piece.
look, everybody knows
the nephew is
a brain-fried retrobate.
yeah, whatever.
he's a fuckin' tweaker
piece of shit.
and he's cooking meth
in his backyard.
i know i told you
this already,
but it's just
a matter of time
before he blows up the whole
fuckin' neighborhood.
we notice,
but it's a sensitive issue
with me and you.
now, i'm in bed with yugorsky
on this gasoline deal.
hey, it's a good deal.
i don't want
to rock the boat.
aw, fuck that. fuck those
russian cunts, huh?
pa, it's
the fuckin' narc
that's got his dick
in our ass.
hey...
calm down, tommy.
you see, joe,
the tweaker's
got it in his head
that maybe
you were looking
to knock him out
of the cooking business
and help the boy out.
made a piece
available to him.
i would never use a kid
to do something like that.
never.
all right, all right, look.
i made a personal
reassurance to yugorsky
that i would have
my entire crew in the street
out looking for that kid.
now, in the interest
of professional harmony,
i think we all want
to get our stories straight.
you agree,
don't you, joe?
one hamburger,
and you're out of my life.
that's it.
oleg.
oh, shit.
hey, kid...
how you doing?
your old man sent
this stuff out for you.
thanks.
ain't it a little late
for you to be out, huh?
i got twins your age.
they're in bed by now.
what are you, like, 9?
and a half.
i got to go
to the bathroom.
hey, joey...
looks like your kid
don't listen too well.
it must run
in the family.
hey, nicky, get over here.

i thought i told you
to wait in the car.
i had to go
to the bathroom.

some gummy bears?
hey, nicky,

about where your friend

they're looking for him,
and if they find him

they won't find
the gun.

the cops?
yeah.
jesus christ. this is
fuckin' bullshit.
hey...
fuck!
hey! you got nicky

yeah, he's right here.
then stop using
your mouth around him
and bring my son

yeah. yeah,
that's what i'm doing.
i'm bringing him home
right now.
ah.
do you mind?
i'm feeling
kind of parched.
big game friday night.
i bet you're excited
about that, huh?
it's gonna be red ice
and plenty of
blue shirt body bags.
am i right?
ha ha ha.
look...
i could help you, kid--
you and your mom,
if need be.
now, i could get that prick
out of your life,
lock him up.
i could do that.
i'm a cop.
all you have to do
is tell me
where you found the gun
and where you stashed it.
that's it.
what do you say?
you let me help you.
get out of here, mila.
you know,
go to a shelter.
i mean, i can get you
an address.
you don't understand.
i belong to him.
no. no. no, no, no.
i don't understand.
i was prostitute
in moscow.
yugorsky
escort service
offered to
bring girls over
with promise
of big bucks.
we would owe
$50,000--
you know, pay back
through work.
i take offer,
not tell them
i'm pregnant.
when they
find out...
they insist
i have an abortion.
tss.
i told them no.
they sent anzor
to kill me.
anzor's not a killer.
he's not hard man
like big yugorsky.
he thinks...
he thinks he's,
you know, john wayne.
must do right thing.
he goes
against his uncle.
he tells
big man yugorsky
he will pay off my debt.
his uncle refuses,
tells him...
he will send others
to kill me
to set example.
so, anzor make me wife.
big man yugorsky can't
kill his nephew's wife.
but he tells anzor
to leave
little odessa.
he's no longer
working for
yugorsky family.
yeah.
i'm gonna get you
the name of a shelter.
you ok?
this ain't right, joe.
he don't need to be
put through this.
nick, i'm proud of you.
you done good, all right?
look, i'm gonna head up
to community hills.
the cops don't got
the gun yet,
but i may have a line on it,
so i'm gonna go over there.
i'm scared, joe.
i am pissed at you,
and i am scared--
equal measures.
be careful.
hey.
hey.
just got word. the cops
picked up the kid.
anything you still
want to tell us?
tell you what?
there's nothing to tell.
where you headed, joe?
uh, i was supposed
to head to the store
and pick up
some milk and eggs.
in all the excitement,
i forgot to do it, so...
hmm. yugorsky's
gonna call us
when he talks
to the kid.
don't go too far.
later, joe.
yeah, see you.
hey, t...

he keeps giving me
this bullshit story
about finding the gun
in some abandoned locker
in school.
what do you
want me to do?

spill dick to you.
you know, i don't think
i'm being clear enough here.

i'm looking for oleg.
oleg? you must have
the wrong address.

a 10-year-old boy.
he's pale.
he never smiles.
he's my neighbor's kid.
he called me
from this apartment.
owens park lane,
apartment 303.
well, he must've given
you the wrong address,
or maybe
you heard wrong.
there's no oleg here.
he also said that he was
being held against his will.
that is ridiculous.
there's only my husband
and my 2 children
inside--
no one else.
and it's late.
well, i'd like to take
a little look inside
just to satisfy
my curiosity.
this is absurd.
what are you suggesting?
that i kidnapped oleg?
or you know what? i'm just
gonna call the police,
and i'm gonna stand here
for the next half-hour
waiting for them
to arrive
when all's you got to do
is just let me in.
if you must.
do you mind?
go right ahead.
the children's room
is on the right.
they are asleep.
please, go right in.
hello.
don't even ask.
it's too ridiculous.
sorry. i'm really
embarrassed.
excuse me,
but i seriously doubt
he's hiding in there.
what's through here?
the playroom.
whoa. wow.
you guys got your own little
disneyland in here.
well, it's all about
the children,
and as you can see,
there's no oleg.
i really hope
that you find him.
you hear too many stories
these days.
god only knows
if it were our children.
where are your children
photographs?
excuse me?
photographs.
no photographs.
if they were
your children,
you would have
at least one photograph
somewhere
in this apartment.
this is ridiculous.
we only just moved
into this place.
everything's in storage.
now, i really must
ask you to leave.
i insist!
oleg?
what the hell
do you want me to do?
you let this bitch in here
in the first place.
all right? right. ok.
oh, man. this is too much.
it's too much. it's like
some kind of a lure.
you're making
a mistake.
tell her
to leave, dez.
ma'am, if you don't leave
right now...
i'm calling
the police.
call 'em. call 'em.
and be sure to mention
that you got 2 abducted
children in the next room.
in any photographs
in this house.
this is insane.
where is oleg?
how dare you suggest
that we--
ohh.
where's the boy?
where is he?!
oh, god.
oh. you better pray
he's not dead. oh.
back off, you sick fuck.
jesus.
oh, god help me.
come on, come on,
come on, come on.

motherfucking cunt!

you're gonna
breathe now, oleg.

that's right.
ok.
just cutting
through wire.
uhh. uhh.
back off!
i said back off!
i will blow you away!
ok. ok, get up.
ok.
go to the bedroom,
get the 2 kids.
bring them downstairs.
nicky's there.
all right?
wait with them. ok?
move over.
get out of his way.
no, i've got a safe
in the bedroom.
there's 100,000 cash
in there in diamonds.
all you gotta do is
take the boy and walk away.
oh, my god.
oh.
oh, god.
no. oh...
oh, my god.
oh, my god.
oh, my god.
oh.
oh, you sick fucks.

where the cab
dropped him off at.

taken the kid and left?
why couldn't you just have
taken the kid and left?!
i have never seen evil

real fucking evil.
ok?
and i know that's
not what i see
when i look
in your eyes.
that's a lot, t.
i'm trying to make
a point here!
no, i know the point
you're trying to make!
i did not marry
an evil man, ok?
i did not marry
an evil man.
shady, sleazy,
mixed up with the wrong
kind of people,
but definitely not evil.
i know what you're
trying to say, t.
do you?!
i hope so.
i have turned my back
on a lot of things since
we've been married.
my eyes are wide open
on this one.
nicky, go home
with your ma.
oleg, let's go
take a ride.

from russia.

'cause you were born in the
united states of america.

hmm?
i won't say nothing.

the cops?
what'd you say to them?
what did you say to 'em?
i told them i got the gun
from steven monroe's locker.
he doesn't go there no more.
nicky told me to say that.
nicky told you
to say that?
smart kid.
he's my best friend.

we're gonna reclaim some
stolen property here.
don't worry about it.
we're just gonna
sit tight for a while.
you know, uh...
i used to know this kid.
his old man was a real
fuckin' piece of shit.
always drunk.
always smackin' him
and his mom around.
this kid,
he takes his licks,
and he waits this
old fuckin' prick out.
and on the morning
of his 14th birthday,
he walks into
his old man's room
with a baseball bat...
and he mark mcgwires the fuckin'
living shit out of him.
after that, the old man...
he can't even hold a spoon
without shaking.
he don't remember things
too good, either.
he's neutralized.
which is a good thing.
maybe 3. if you
get some size early on,
you'll be all right.
you just gotta hang in there.
'cause it's more money.
it's lonely at the top.
i'm telling you,
this corporation...
get your hands off
of lester's property.
that's my property.
i'm sorry.
all right,
