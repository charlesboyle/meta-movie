best about this place?

167

Apart from the free glacé cherries?

168
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,474
Apart from the free glacé cherries,

169
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,309
the fact that they
still insist upon

170
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,395

like a Tongan concubine.

171

prefer Polynesian call girl.

So talk me through
head-butting your new boss.

174
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,029
Well, actually, she might
have head-butted me,

175
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,825
but our lanyards tangled.
There was a struggle, you know?

176
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,161
Our heads went forward.
There was a crash, wallop.

177
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,454
Mm, sounds like she made
quite an impression.

178

- No, no, not this again.
- Oh, come on, Bruce.

179
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,376
You haven't even mentioned a girl
since, what, the early '90s?

180
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,045
Stand down, Samantha, please.
She is not of my world.

181
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,715

right next to precious comfort zone?

Got to reach out and grab it.

And the sweat dripping off of her,

805
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:28,167
it was like a waterfall
of babies' tears.

806
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,211
Mm, poetic.

807
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:33,923
Ah, I think we all know
where this is headed.

808
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,675
Inside of her.

809
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,469
- You know what I mean?
- <font color="#808080">(SOFTLY)</font> Yeah.

810
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,181
- Why are you telling me all this?
- Don't be a virgin.

811
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,350
- I know you made a play for her.
- No, I didn't.

812
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,646
A mix tape? Are you
fucking John Cusack now?

813
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,815
You took it.
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHS)</font>

814
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,610
I didn't want you to be embarrassed.
She'd laugh in your face.

815
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,737
I made it for her car.

816
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,739
- Just give me it, will you?
- Your big arms are too slow.

817
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,699
- Julia: Hey, guys.
- Hey, Jules.

818
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,452
- How's it going?
- Really good. Really good.

819
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,870
Last night was fun, right?

820
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,788
- So much fun.
- Yeah, it was good.

821
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,249
Helen was obviously trying
to hustle us all, but...

822
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,252
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHS)</font>

- How are your little footsies?

824
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,342
- You know what? Pretty sore.
- I'll bet they are.

825
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,719
We, uh, stopped off at a
club on the way home.

826
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,638
That's right.

827
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,973
I'm going to go.
I've got things to do.

- See you later, Brucie.
- Bye, Bruce.

829
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,485

830
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:42,575
Oh, shit.

831
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:46,412
Oh, shit. Oh.

832
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,457
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, just having a manicure.

833
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,207
- This came. Will you sign for it?
- Sure.

834
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,873

00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,190
- That was so fun.
- Yeah.

841
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,859
- We should do it again.
- Yeah, maybe.

842
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,611
What's erm... What's with the tape?

843
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,780
Oh, shoot.

844
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:24,994
You caught me.
Er, it's for your car.

845
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:28,865
Oh, my God. You made an inlay.

846
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,082
- <font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>
- Yes, I did.

847
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:33,000
Nobody makes inlays anymore.

848
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,713
Yeah, it's just a silly, little
touch I thought you'd like.

849
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:39,841
That's really...
That's really nice.

850
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:42,260
Now I feel like I have
to get you something.

851
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:44,804

One might say I'm
addicted to the craic,

858
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,957
but right now I just
want to get my head down

859
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:16,162
and plough my way through this
bucket of balls, all right?

860

Yeah?

for our weekly roundup.

Unexplained homoerotic encounters
with rugged foreign males. Mickey?

- Nil.
- Me, nil. Brucie?

00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:32,101
Ah, fuck the weekly roundup.

865
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,770

00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:39,567
Come on, Bruce. Who was he?

868
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:41,987
- What are you hiding from us?
- Nothing.

869
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,865
Aw.

870
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:50,077
Did the sexy sultan's rich bath
milk irritate your sensitive skin?

871
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,497
- Fuck off.
- Oh!

872

- I'm sorry. Are you OK?
- Yeah, fine mate.

874
00:54:57,085 --> 00:55:00,289
- Yeah, forget about it.
- Hey, hey, hey. Don't go.

875
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:05,176
Yeah, this is the one, the
trusty arsehole wedge.

876
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:08,012
Hey, hey. Don't... Gary, don't...

- With the little shoes?
- Yes.

00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,557
Yes, salsa with the little shoes.

895
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,653
Why?

896
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:09,240
I was doing it for that girl.

- What girl?
- The... the butterfly.

00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,787
The eponymous butterfly

899
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,582
from the "Tale of the
Butterfly and the Parsnip".

900
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,998
- The parsnip, the butterfly.
- Oh.

901
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:25,298
What, you thought the parsnip
would win the butterfly

902
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:27,466
by doing a bit of
tiny shoe shuffle?

903
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,841
Yes. I know. It's stupid, isn't it?

904
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:34,974

Oh, yes, that horse's arse.

00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,896
Yeah. Well, he likes her, too.

907
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:44,022
He might be a horse's arse, but he's
better at all this than I am so...

908
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,020
I might just let him
get on with it.

909
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:51,699
Yeah, mate, just...
It's probably for the best.

910
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,904

night, she's the one, hm?

- It doesn't matter.
- No, of course, it doesn't matter.

918

couldn't be any smaller.

<i>La doña,</i> the woman.

- It's always about a woman.
- Mm-hmm.

925
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,348
I just wanted you to make
me good enough for her.

Why don't you just keep standing
in front of that mirror

927
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,935
and do what you did in the

928

- What?

- Come on. We got work to do.

We're going to get shit-faced
and play board games.

- Eye piece for one eye?
- Monocle.

- What are you so scared of, eh?
- I'm not.

954
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:16,427
- Just do the impression, then.
- No, I'm not doing...

955
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:18,137
Why are you so afraid of
what people might think?

956
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:20,097
Why can't you put
yourself out there?

957
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,807
- I mean...
- So do the impression.

- It's almost time.
- Do the impression.

959
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:27,104
- That's it. Time.
- Do the fucking impression!

960
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:31,108
- Why are you always shouting at me?
- Because you fucking quit on me.

961

- I did not quit.
- You had the world at your feet.

962

- And you walked away, didn't you?

- No, I didn't.
- Oh, yes, you did.

964
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:40,493
You keep swanning back in
here and swanning out again.

- Swanning back in...
- They broke me. All right?

If you want to know, the night of
the competition, they broke me.
