1
00:02:41,737 --> 00:02:42,943
Mr. Faulk? James Sandin.

2
00:02:43,017 --> 00:02:43,984
Hey, Mr. Sandin.

3
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:46,503
I talked to John over at
repairs, and he took care of it.

4
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:47,703
It's all fine.

5
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:49,142
The system is working
without a hitch.

6
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:50,742
You are going to be
locked in tight tonight.

7
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:51,898
Thank you, sir.

8
00:02:51,977 --> 00:02:54,059
All right, Mr. Faulk.
Safe night.

9
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:57,103
SUSAN: James Sandin's office.

10
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,667
Sue? Yeah,
I took care of Faulk.

11
00:02:58,737 --> 00:02:59,818
What do you know,
did you hear anything?

12
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:01,058
You're number one,
Mr. Sandin.

13
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,940
All right. Yeah. You got it, sir.
You came out on top.

14
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,065
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

15
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:06,502
Congratulations
to you, too, Susan.

16
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:07,544
You don't have
to say that.

17
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:11,338
No, Susan, it's a team win.
Thank you.

18
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,181
Okay. All right,
well, safe night.

19
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:15,259
Safe night, Mr. Sandin.

20
00:03:18,817 --> 00:03:21,024
MALE CALLER ON RADIO: The poor can't
afford to protect themselves.

21
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:22,383
They're
the victims tonight.

22
00:03:22,457 --> 00:03:23,697
MALE RADIO ANNOUNCER:
We all got our own opinions.

23
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:25,017
That's what makes
this country great.

24
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:27,418
Holly, line four.
What are your Purge plans?

25
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:29,858
HOLLY: Locking down behind my
brand new security system.

26
00:03:29,937 --> 00:03:32,338
Pete from Northern Virginia,
what's your Purge plan?

27
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:34,027
PETE: I'm gonna
hunt down my boss.

28
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:35,462
That son of a bitch
has it coming.

29
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:38,017
Clearly, more people will be Purging
this year than ever before.

30
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:39,906
American streets will
be running red tonight,

31
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:42,458
when people release the beast
in record numbers.

32
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:45,421
JAMES: Mr. Cali! You're getting one
last walk in before lockdown, huh?

33
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:46,498
Yep

34
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:48,227
Did you do the systems
check I recommended?

35
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:49,537
Of course.
No problems.

36
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:51,824
Yeah, it's the same one I use.
I only sell the best.

37
00:03:51,937 --> 00:03:53,507
Nobody's
bothering us tonight.

38
00:03:53,617 --> 00:03:55,745
You have a safe night, Mr. Sandin.
Thanks.

39
00:03:55,857 --> 00:03:57,746
MALE RADIO ANNOUNCER: Don't forget
to buy your blue Baptisias.

40
00:03:57,977 --> 00:04:00,378
Display those flowers
proudly, folks, okay?

41
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:02,824
Show your support
for this important evening.

42
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:03,898
Safe night to everyone.

43
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,105
Home again, home again.
Jiggity-jig.

44
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:09,624
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Release the beast,
and Purge in our American streets.

45
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:10,937
Your New Founding Fathers..

46
00:04:32,017 --> 00:04:33,587
Hey, honey, I'm home!

47
00:04:33,657 --> 00:04:35,102
MARY: I'm in the kitchen.

48
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:36,542

What a day, what a day.

49
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:39,507
Everybody's doing security
checks, it's crazy.

50
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:42,183
Traffic's even worse
than last year.

51
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,260
Something smells good.

52
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:48,183
Hey-

53
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:50,542
Ta-da!
Ah.

54
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:54,341
I'll put them in water,
get them outside.

55
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:56,380
Okay.
Where are the kids?

56
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:58,107
Their rooms, of course.

57
00:04:58,177 --> 00:05:00,100
 We got an hour
before commencement, right?

58
00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:01,542
Mmm-hmm.
Dinner's nearly ready,

59
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:03,267
so, uh, hurry up.
All right.

60
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:04,947
Well, I have to make a few phone calls.
Mmm-hmm.

61
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:06,018
Oh.

62
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,383
One thing?
Yeah?

63
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:08,743
Zoey is getting worse.

64
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:11,343
She's been pouting all day.
I can't stand it.

65
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:13,778
So, you're gonna have to do something
about the Henry situation.

66
00:05:13,857 --> 00:05:15,143
There's nothing
to do about it.

67
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:16,457
He's 18, he's not
getting any younger.

68
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:18,983
She's just gonna have to sulk.
She'll get over it.

69
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:20,661
But I've got some good
news for all of us.

70
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,341
I'll tell you at dinner.

71
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:28,344
DR. BUYNAK ON TV: History has
proven this over and over again.

72
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,658
We are inherently
a violent species.

73
00:05:30,737 --> 00:05:32,899
Wars, genocide, murder.

74
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:35,628
The denial of our true
selves is the problem.

75
00:05:35,697 --> 00:05:39,622
The Purge not only contains societal
violence to a single evening,

76
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:42,906
but the country-wide catharsis
creates psychological stability

77
00:05:42,977 --> 00:05:46,538
by letting us release the aggression
we all have inside of us.

78
00:06:01,097 --> 00:06:02,587
I love you.

79
00:06:06,217 --> 00:06:07,423
Let's growl.

80
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:08,824
What?

81
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:10,183
Growl.
Why?

82
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:12,585
Because everyone says,
"I love you."

83
00:06:12,657 --> 00:06:15,228
It's used, and we need
to find our own thing.

84
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,907
Oh.
Go like this..

85
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:20,463
No, I'll look silly.

86
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:21,743
Come on.
No.

87
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:24,104
Do it. It's our way of saying,
"I love you." Try it.

88
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,178
Do it.

89
00:06:34,697 --> 00:06:35,778
I think my dad's home.

90
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:40,302
I'm sorry, baby. You've
got to get going. 

91
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:41,458
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:43,587
And you have to get
home before lockdown.

93
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:46,148
Come on.

94
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:48,343
Come here.

95
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:01,064
Someone's getting
ready for tonight.

96
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:11,621
Be careful.

97
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:31,778
GRACE: Mary!

98
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:34,267
I'm so glad I caught you.

99
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:35,907
I come bearing gifts.


100
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:39,422
What have I done
to deserve a gift, Grace?

101
00:07:39,537 --> 00:07:40,948
Oh, I have a new hobby.
Baking. Grace. Mary.

102
00:07:41,017 --> 00:07:42,223
I made way
too many cookies.

103
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:43,787
Hi!
Ooh! Cookies!

104
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:45,263
I hope you're hungry

105
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:46,708
Those cookies
are crazy good.

106
00:07:46,737 --> 00:07:48,102
 MRS.HALVERSON: They're lovely.

107
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:50,022
Have a safe night,
ladies.

108
00:07:50,097 --> 00:07:51,508
Bye!
Good night!

109
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:53,985
Bye!
Thank you, Grace.

110
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,539
Yeah, just what the Halversons needed.
More cookies, right?

111
00:07:58,537 --> 00:07:59,538
Oh!

112
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:03,624
The new addition you built,
it's just amazing.

113
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:04,698
Thank you.

114
00:08:04,857 --> 00:08:07,428
Not everyone had the
year you did, Mary.

115
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:08,898
What do you mean?

116
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:12,586
You know your husband
sold a new security system

117
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:14,586
to almost every home
in this community.

118
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:17,784
You know, some people
are actually saying

119
00:08:17,857 --> 00:08:21,418
this neighborhood paid for that
new addition on your home.

120
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:23,660
Are people
really saying that?

121
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,899
Relax, it's just good old
neighborhood gossip.

122
00:08:25,977 --> 00:08:28,059
Nothing to worry about.

123
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:29,582
You're too sensitive.

124
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:34,466
So, are you having your
annual party, Grace?

125
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:36,346
No. Too much trouble.

126
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,499
We're just gonna lock down,
watch some Purge events.

127
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:40,102
Nothing special.

128
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:44,823
Well, um,
thank you for the cookies.

129
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:45,938
Good night.

130
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:48,145
You're welcome.

131
00:08:48,937 --> 00:08:50,302
Have a safe night,
Mary.

132
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:51,947
And you, Grace.

133
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,377
Christ.

134
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:34,141
You scared me to death.

135
00:09:36,497 --> 00:09:38,977
You can't keep creeping up
on me like that, Charlie.

136
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:47,467
So, quit playing with Timmy and come
help me set the table, kiddo. Okay?

137
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,138
Now.

138
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,705
Christ! Charlie,
that's twice today.

139
00:10:25,777 --> 00:10:27,347
You're gonna give me
a heart attack.

140
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:28,538
Sorry, Mom.

141
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:30,984
Look, check it out. I made
some adjustments to Timmy.

142
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:32,741
I installed
a night vision program

143
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:35,104
and I insulated his motor,
so you can barely hear him.

144
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:39,307
And he can now play music to
accompany him on his missions.

145
00:10:45,137 --> 00:10:46,218
See?

146
00:10:47,377 --> 00:10:49,584
He likes songs from olden times.
Mmm-hmm.

147
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:51,418
That is very, very cool.

148
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:57,186
What is it?
What's bothering you?

149
00:10:58,697 --> 00:10:59,903
It's tonight, isn't it?

150
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:04,223
Just remember all the good
the Purge does, okay?

151
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,344
It's all that matters.

152
00:11:07,777 --> 00:11:09,142
Are you hungry?

153
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:10,704
A little bit.

154
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:11,824
 Good.

155
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:15,106
Well, take Timmy away and come
back and help me finish up, okay?

156
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:16,417
Mmm. Okay.

157
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:34,699
Honey,
this food is so good.

158
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,905
Isn't it amazing?
Not one carb.

159
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,901
Oh, great.
Notone.

160
00:11:40,377 --> 00:11:42,823
Well, I'd like to hear
about everybody's day.

161
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:43,898
Zoey,
you want to go first?

162
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,543
Charlie,
what are you doing?

163
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:53,380
Sorry, I forgot
to take my vitals earlier.

164
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:54,578
Honey..

165
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:58,941
By the way, there's a slight
deviation in my heart rate,

166
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:00,587
but other than that,

167
00:12:01,377 --> 00:12:02,617
nothing to worry about.

168
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:03,898
JAMES: Okay, thank you.

169
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,502
Zoey, your day.

170
00:12:06,697 --> 00:12:08,108
I don't want to do
this anymore.

171
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:09,902
It's stupid.

172
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:20,902
Okay, fine.

173
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:23,742
Calc test, piano. Normal day.
Mmm-hmm.

174
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:25,218
Who cares?

175
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:27,140
I do.
I care, very much.

176
00:12:27,217 --> 00:12:29,219
And what about practice?
You ready for your recital?

177
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:30,298
James.

178
00:12:30,377 --> 00:12:31,742
Of course you are,
because you're always ready.

179
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,740
Just make sure your left hand
cooperates in that third movement.

180
00:12:35,977 --> 00:12:37,979
When I'm listening,
that's what I hear.

181
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:39,747
All right, can I..

182
00:12:39,817 --> 00:12:41,057
Does anybody mind?
Can I do my day?

183
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:43,219
I have some news. Um..
MARY: Go ahead.

184
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:47,342
I did it. I did it.

185
00:12:48,337 --> 00:12:50,180
All sales are final..

186
00:12:50,577 --> 00:12:51,624
And I'm on top.

187
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:55,427
My division sold the most
upgraded security systems.

188
00:12:55,497 --> 00:12:56,942
Congratulations, Dad.
Thank you.

189
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:58,143
Congratulations, baby.

190
00:12:58,217 --> 00:12:59,662
Thanks. It's a team
effort, you know?

191
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:02,625
All right, Charlie,
you're next.

192
00:13:02,737 --> 00:13:05,388
Well, we studied the history
of tonight in History.

193
00:13:05,657 --> 00:13:07,546
And in English,
I wrote a story

194
00:13:07,657 --> 00:13:11,423
about a man whose love is so
powerful, that it can kill people.

195
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:13,107
So, he cuts out
his own heart.

196
00:13:13,337 --> 00:13:14,987
That is so sweet.

197
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:17,059
You know, he should have
cut off his own penis.

198
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:18,468
Zoey,Zoey.

199
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:20,221
Eating dinner,
no penises!

200
00:13:20,377 --> 00:13:22,857
(OVERLAPPING PROTESTS) JAMES:
Charlie, don't encourage her.

201
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:24,098
Don't fist-bump that!

202
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:26,864
 We're not
in the dormitorium, okay?

203
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:30,100
ZOEY: "Dormitorium?"
Is that even a word?

204
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,906
Get with the times.
God.

205
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:35,587
Guys,
look what time it is.

206
00:13:37,657 --> 00:13:39,307
Oh, wow,
it's later than I thought.

207
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:42,062
All right, it's time
for lockdown. Let's go.

208
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,061
Don't even
think about it.

209
00:13:46,137 --> 00:13:47,423
Hey, give that back.
Are we in the zoo?

210
00:13:47,497 --> 00:13:48,498
Fine,
I want this.

211
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:50,937
Hey, look at this.

212
00:13:51,617 --> 00:13:53,984
Mr. Sabian and Mr. Barbero
are going hunting.

213
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:55,468
That's daring.

214
00:13:55,897 --> 00:13:57,137
I didn't know they were
going to Purge together.

215
00:13:57,217 --> 00:13:58,218
Are they friends?

216
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:04,139
Hmm. The Ferrins
are having a party.

217
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:05,986
Grace said she wasn't
having a party this year.

218
00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:07,707
JAMES: Just thank God
we weren't invited.

219
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:10,348
She's nice. But, wow,
she's annoying.

220
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:13,261
All right, let's get
ready for tonight.

221
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,980
As always,
just a precaution.

222
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:34,660
All right, Mr. Cali is
starting his lockdown.

223
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:36,778
Okay-

224
00:14:37,817 --> 00:14:39,501
Are we ready?

225
00:14:42,777 --> 00:14:44,347
All right,
let's hit it.

226
00:15:18,177 --> 00:15:20,066
Okay, Charlie, it's
almost time. Hit it.

227
00:15:21,497 --> 00:15:24,740
MALE ANNOUNCER: Release the beast
and Purge in our American streets.

228
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:28,344
Your New Founding Fathers
encourage your participation.

229
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:37,901
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
This is not a test.

230
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:40,418
This is your
Emergency Broadcast System

231
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:42,977
announcing the commencement
of the Annual Purge

232
00:15:43,057 --> 00:15:44,946
sanctioned by
the U. S. Government.

233
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:47,065
Weapons of
Class Four and lower

234
00:15:47,137 --> 00:15:49,583
have been authorized
for use during the Purge.

235
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,819
All other weapons
are restricted.

236
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:54,184
Government officials
of ranking 10

237
00:15:54,257 --> 00:15:55,941
have been granted
immunity from the Purge

238
00:15:56,337 --> 00:15:57,702
and shall not be harmed.

239
00:15:58,137 --> 00:15:59,627
Commencing at the siren,

240
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:02,587
any and all crime,
including murder,

241
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:05,228
will be legal for
12 continuous hours.

242
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:09,661
Police, fire and emergency medical
services will be unavailable

243
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:13,628
until tomorrow morning at 7:00
AM when the Purge concludes.

244
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:15,506
Blessed be our
New Founding Fathers

245
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:17,978
and America,
a nation reborn.

246
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:20,099
May God be with you all.

247
00:16:39,777 --> 00:16:43,065
Okay, kids. I know bad
things do happen tonight.

248
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,947
But we can
afford protection.

249
00:16:45,097 --> 00:16:47,338
So, we'll be fine, just like always.
No worries.

250
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:50,068
OKay? OKay?

251
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:51,783
Can I go now?

252
00:16:52,457 --> 00:16:54,937
I would prefer to be
miserable in my room.

253
00:16:55,377 --> 00:16:57,584
Of course you may.
Thank you for being here.

254
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:04,619
Where are you going,
bud?

255
00:17:04,697 --> 00:17:06,426
Hey.
Charlie.

256
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:12,025
Why don't you guys do it?

257
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:20,104
Because we don't feel the
need to, Charlie. That's all.

258
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:22,143
So, if you felt
the need to,

259
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:23,628
you would kill
someone tonight?

260
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:27,907
Look, I know this is difficult
to understand at your age,

261
00:17:27,977 --> 00:17:31,379
but tonight allows
people a release

262
00:17:31,457 --> 00:17:34,700
for all the hatred and
violence and aggression

263
00:17:34,777 --> 00:17:36,620
that they keep up
inside them.

264
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,180
Okay? And yes,

265
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:43,421
if your mother and I were so
inclined, uh, we would participate.

266
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,226
Because it works.

267
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,538
You don't remember
how bad it was, Charlie.

268
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:49,540
The poverty,
all the crime.

269
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:52,179
This night
saved our country.

270
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,142

Hey..

271
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:06,708
Why don't you go relax?
We're all done here.

272
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:11,180
I've got some paperwork
to process to get my bonus.

273
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:14,827
Then we should watch a
movie later with the kids.

274
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:57,023
Jesus, Henry!

275
00:18:57,297 --> 00:18:59,425
You scared
the hell out of me.

276
00:18:59,897 --> 00:19:01,387
Wait,
what are you doing here?

277
00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:03,381
I wanted to surprise you.

278
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:05,937
So,lsnuckin
when you were eating.

279
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:07,786
Baby,
you can't be in here.

280
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:11,145
My dad will lose his mind
if he sees you here now.

281
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,457
Come on.

282
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:15,060
Aren't you happy
to see me?

283
00:19:16,497 --> 00:19:17,908
Of course.

284
00:19:23,937 --> 00:19:26,338
FEMALE ANCHOR: We're looking at some
live feeds from around the country

285
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:29,899
and discussing the Purge with
criminologist Tommy Aagaard.

286
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:30,978
TOMMY: Thanks, Nicole.

287
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:33,901
Now, is the Purge really
about releasing aggression

288
00:19:33,977 --> 00:19:35,263
and containing violence,

289
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:36,981
or is it something else?

290
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:38,547
Purge detractors
often postulate

291
00:19:38,617 --> 00:19:41,780
this evening is actually about
the elimination of the poor,

292
00:19:41,857 --> 00:19:43,347
the needy, the sick.

293
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,226
Those unable
to defend themselves.

294
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:47,061
The eradication
of the so-called

295
00:19:47,137 --> 00:19:49,219
"non-contributing members"
of society,

296
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:51,664
ultimately unburdening
the economy.

297
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:53,739
Is the Purge
really about money?

298
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:58,101
Either way, crime is down.
The economy is flourishing.

299
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:54,741
I can't do this.

300
00:20:57,217 --> 00:20:58,264
Um..

301
00:20:58,377 --> 00:21:00,459
Did I do something?
No. I.. Um..

302
00:21:02,257 --> 00:21:04,066
I just..

303
00:21:04,177 --> 00:21:05,508
I didn't come here
to see you.

304
00:21:08,177 --> 00:21:09,508
I came to see
your father.

305
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:10,738
What? Why?

306
00:21:10,817 --> 00:21:13,343
It's time
to straighten this out.

307
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:17,024
He cannot forbid you
from seeing me.

308
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:18,303
That's crazy.

309
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,948
It might be crazy, but he's
not going to change his mind.

310
00:21:21,017 --> 00:21:22,348
He thinks
you're too old for me.

311
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:24,419
Talking to him is only going
to make him more angry

312
00:21:24,497 --> 00:21:27,103
and he'll make it
more difficult for us.

313
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:32,141
I promise everything
is gonna be okay.

314
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:44,427
TOMMY ON TV:
America was collapsing.

315
00:21:44,497 --> 00:21:48,388
A quadruple dip recession
followed by a full market crash.

316
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:51,108
A skyrocketing debt,
multiple wars

317
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,498
and a significant
dollar devaluation..

318
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:56,581
All precipitating
the worst economic disaster

319
00:21:56,657 --> 00:21:58,705
in the history
of the United States.

320
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,303
Crime and poverty
rose exponentially,

321
00:22:01,377 --> 00:22:04,620
and the New Founding Fathers,
just months after being elected

322
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:06,978
came up with
this audacious notion,

323
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:10,425
the decriminalization
of murder for one night.

324
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,467
A lawful outlet
for American rage.

325
00:22:13,577 --> 00:22:15,659
A way to contain crime.

326
00:22:15,737 --> 00:22:19,059
The undeniable fact is,
this is working.

327
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:41,901
MARY: I thought
I heard gunshots.

328
00:22:42,617 --> 00:22:44,267
A couple of streets back,
maybe?

329
00:22:44,337 --> 00:22:47,978
Gunshots are gonna happen tonight, okay?
It's nothing.

330
00:22:48,057 --> 00:22:50,264
It's probably somebody just
firing off a few rounds

331
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:52,180
before going hunting.

332
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:55,818
Come on.
Let's go relax.

333
00:24:00,497 --> 00:24:01,942
Hold on.

334
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:05,545
Look.
He can't kick me out.

335
00:24:05,617 --> 00:24:08,939
He's gonna be forced to
listen to what I have to say.

336
00:24:09,017 --> 00:24:10,348
I don't know.

337
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:14,419
One on one.
Man to man, no BS.

338
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:18,260
I'm gonna explain to him
that sure, I may be older,

339
00:24:18,337 --> 00:24:20,908
but you're also
very mature.

340
00:24:20,977 --> 00:24:23,821
So age difference
is not a problem.

341
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:28,378
I'll tell him
how much I love you.

342
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:38,624
JAMES: 10 years ago,
we could barely afford rent.

343
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:41,303
Now we're thinking about buying a boat.


344
00:24:41,377 --> 00:24:42,742
Crazy.

345
00:24:44,337 --> 00:24:45,338
Yeah.. Uh-oh.

346
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,340
This one has
a car garage. 

347
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:49,986
Who needs a car on a boat?

348
00:24:53,897 --> 00:24:55,661
BLOODY STRANGER:
They're coming after me.

349
00:24:55,737 --> 00:24:57,421
They're gonna kill me!

350
00:25:00,137 --> 00:25:02,583
Can anyone hear me?

351
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:09,308
Help me!
Someone, please, help me!

352
00:25:28,937 --> 00:25:30,427
They're coming
after me, all right?

353
00:25:32,897 --> 00:25:35,104
Can anybody help me?

354
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:38,624
Please. They killed..

355
00:25:38,697 --> 00:25:40,301
I just need to get
somewhere safe.

356
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:42,579
Does anybody hear me?

357
00:25:43,097 --> 00:25:44,940
Look, I won't hurt you!

358
00:25:46,137 --> 00:25:47,901
I don't want to die.

359
00:25:48,057 --> 00:25:49,547
I don't deserve this.

360
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:51,621
Why won't anybody help me?

361
00:25:51,737 --> 00:25:53,626
I just need somewhere to hide.

362
00:25:53,697 --> 00:25:56,098
Somebody, please, just open the door for me.


363
00:25:56,257 --> 00:25:58,464
They're coming, they're coming.
Somebody, please!

364
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,018
They're gonna kill me!

365
00:26:05,217 --> 00:26:06,821
What the hell?

366
00:26:17,217 --> 00:26:18,218
Come here!

367
00:26:19,137 --> 00:26:21,344
Let's go!
This way!

368
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:24,348
Come on!

369
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,498
Hurry!

370
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:28,584
Come on! Hurry!

371
00:26:28,657 --> 00:26:29,897
What the hell?

372
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:33,784
Charlie! Zoey!

373
00:26:35,017 --> 00:26:36,781
CHARLIE: This way! Hurry!

374
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:37,983
Go! Go!

375
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:39,498
Hurry!

376
00:26:47,137 --> 00:26:48,218
JAMES: What the hell
is going on?

377
00:27:03,257 --> 00:27:04,383
HENRY: Mr. Sandin.

378
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:08,858
James, he has a gun!
Henry has a gun!

379
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,577
Oh, my God!

380
00:27:11,177 --> 00:27:12,508

Henry!

381
00:27:13,457 --> 00:27:14,982
Henry! Henry!

382
00:27:15,057 --> 00:27:16,661
Oh, God!

383
00:27:18,257 --> 00:27:19,861
James. Are you hit?

384
00:27:21,737 --> 00:27:23,148
I didn't hit Zoey,
did I?

385
00:27:23,217 --> 00:27:24,343
I think she's okay.

386
00:27:24,497 --> 00:27:26,465
Zoey!Zoey!

387
00:27:26,537 --> 00:27:27,777
MARY:
Charlie, come here.

388
00:27:27,857 --> 00:27:29,268
Mom, what's going on?

389
00:27:29,337 --> 00:27:31,180
JAMES: Charlie,
where is he, huh?

390
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:32,982
Where's the man?

391
00:27:34,577 --> 00:27:36,102
 I don't know.
I don't understand.

392
00:27:36,177 --> 00:27:38,578
Who is he? Why did you
let him in our home?

393
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,944
He was hurt. He called for help.
No one was helping him.

394
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:43,224
Charlie, Jesus Christ.
What the hell? Huh?

395
00:27:43,337 --> 00:27:44,748
We have no idea what
this man is capable of.

396
00:27:44,817 --> 00:27:46,706
Enough.
Enough, James.

397
00:27:46,857 --> 00:27:49,019
He's gone. We don't know
what Henry might do.

398
00:27:49,097 --> 00:27:52,021
And we're not safe out here.
We don't know where Zoey is.

399
00:27:53,137 --> 00:27:55,344
You're right.
Let's go. Come on.

400
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:56,657
Come on,
come on, come on.

401
00:27:56,737 --> 00:27:58,341
Let's go. Let's go.

402
00:28:00,217 --> 00:28:02,697
Henry! Henry.


403
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:04,788
Hang on.


404
00:28:05,257 --> 00:28:06,258
Henry!

405
00:28:09,617 --> 00:28:10,857
Come on.

406
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:13,748
Henry?
(CONTINUES SOBBING)

407
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:36,788
Okay-

408
00:28:37,737 --> 00:28:39,307
Here's the plan.

409
00:28:39,777 --> 00:28:42,701
You two stay put here,
and I'll just..

410
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:46,547
I'll go out there
and I'm gonna find Zoey

411
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:48,142
and I'm gonna
bring her back here.

412
00:28:48,577 --> 00:28:50,341
Henry tried to kill you.
James..

413
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:52,738
I know. Mary, I got
to make sure she's okay.

414
00:28:52,817 --> 00:28:54,182
Okay? I have to.

415
00:28:54,257 --> 00:28:55,986
He didn't shoot at me.

416
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,063
I'll find her,

417
00:28:58,137 --> 00:28:59,821
I can go. I'll be fine.
No,no,noH.

418
00:29:00,097 --> 00:29:02,987
I can't let you go
with that man out there.

419
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:04,104
Okay?
I can't let you do that.

420
00:29:04,457 --> 00:29:05,902
Baby, I..

421
00:29:06,057 --> 00:29:07,058
Let me go get her.

422
00:29:07,137 --> 00:29:09,902
You just stay here
with Charlie. Okay?

423
00:29:09,977 --> 00:29:11,217
You be careful, okay?

424
00:29:11,297 --> 00:29:12,628
I will.

425
00:29:29,377 --> 00:29:31,948
Zoey? Zoey?

426
00:29:34,017 --> 00:29:35,507
Zoey? It's me.

427
00:30:29,657 --> 00:30:30,818
You okay,
sweetheart?

428
00:30:31,217 --> 00:30:32,742
Yeah, Mom.

429
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:35,383
Okay-

430
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:39,022
ZOEY: Mom?

431
00:30:39,097 --> 00:30:40,462
Mom?

432
00:30:40,737 --> 00:30:42,705
Charlie? Mom?

433
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:45,499
Charlie, you wait here. I'm gonna
be right outside the door.

434
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:46,703
Okay-

435
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:49,297
Zoey.

436
00:30:49,377 --> 00:30:50,503
Zoey?

437
00:30:57,017 --> 00:30:58,507
Mom?

438
00:30:59,177 --> 00:31:00,338
Zoey, sweetheart.

439
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:02,021
Are you okay?
ls Charlie okay?

440
00:31:02,137 --> 00:31:04,060
Where's Dad? Is he all right?
Everyone's fine.

441
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:05,662
Morn, I didn't know Henry
was going to do that.

442
00:31:05,777 --> 00:31:07,984
I didn't know he was going to..
Why would he do that?

443
00:31:08,057 --> 00:31:10,264
Mom? Charlie, just give
me a second, okay?

444
00:31:10,337 --> 00:31:11,338
Mom, he died.
Keep the door closed.

445
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,226
He's dead. Henry's dead.
CHARLIE: Mom?

446
00:31:13,897 --> 00:31:15,058
Mom!

447
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:16,741
Charlie,
just give me a second.

448
00:31:16,817 --> 00:31:18,057
Zoey, let's see
what Charlie wants.

449
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:19,184
CHARLIE: Mom, now!

450
00:31:20,897 --> 00:31:22,387
What is it, baby?

451
00:31:22,457 --> 00:31:23,458
You need to see this.

452
00:31:23,937 --> 00:31:24,938
Tell Dad I'm sorry.

453
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:26,746
Zoey, please!

454
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,463
Zoey!

455
00:31:44,577 --> 00:31:46,022
JAMES: Zoey?

456
00:31:49,897 --> 00:31:51,422
Zoey.

457
00:31:59,777 --> 00:32:03,304
FEMALE FREAK 1: Hey,
Mr. Sandin, are you home?

458
00:32:25,337 --> 00:32:26,748
Wait, James,
I have to talk to you.

459
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:28,427
Henry is dead.

460
00:32:28,497 --> 00:32:30,101
I killed him.

461
00:32:30,177 --> 00:32:31,986
I know. I saw Zoey.

462
00:32:32,057 --> 00:32:33,547
Is she okay? Is she hurt?
Is she in there?

463
00:32:33,657 --> 00:32:34,658
She's not hurt.

464
00:32:34,737 --> 00:32:36,705
I couldn't get her
to come with me.

465
00:32:46,577 --> 00:32:48,579
What are we gonna do?

466
00:32:50,537 --> 00:32:52,699
I have to show
you something.

467
00:32:53,257 --> 00:32:55,339
Oh, God, I know.

468
00:33:26,097 --> 00:33:27,906
That one is saying
something.

469
00:33:29,737 --> 00:33:31,546
..and Mrs. Sandin.

470
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,187
Your home tells me you're
good folk, just like us.

471
00:33:35,257 --> 00:33:36,588
One of the "haves."

472
00:33:36,817 --> 00:33:40,503
And your blue flowers tell me
that you support the Purge.

473
00:33:40,577 --> 00:33:43,626
We want to treat you fairly,
so listen closely.

474
00:33:43,697 --> 00:33:44,698
Let me introduce us.

475
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:51,382
We are some fine, young,
very educated guys and gals.

476
00:33:53,377 --> 00:33:57,427
We have gotten gussied up
in our most terrifying guises,

477
00:33:57,497 --> 00:34:00,023
as we do every year,

478
00:34:00,097 --> 00:34:04,705
ready to violate, annihilate,
and cleanse our souls.

479
00:34:06,217 --> 00:34:08,219
But things took a turn.

480
00:34:10,457 --> 00:34:12,619
Our target escaped us, and..

481
00:34:14,537 --> 00:34:19,543
Several of your dear neighbors
informed us that you, the Sandins,

482
00:34:20,937 --> 00:34:23,463
have inexplicably
given him sanctuary.

483
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,106
Mr. and Mrs., the man
you're sheltering is nothing

484
00:34:27,177 --> 00:34:29,100
but a dirty, homeless pig.

485
00:34:29,337 --> 00:34:31,658
A grotesque menace
to our just society,

486
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,104
who had the audacity
to fight back,

487
00:34:34,177 --> 00:34:37,465
killing one of us when we
attempted to execute him tonight.

488
00:34:37,697 --> 00:34:39,381
The pig doesn't
know his place,

489
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:41,585
and now he needs
to be taught a lesson.

490
00:34:41,857 --> 00:34:43,825
You need to return him to us.

491
00:34:44,697 --> 00:34:46,028
Alive.

492
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:49,538
So that we may Purge
as we are entitled.

493
00:34:51,497 --> 00:34:53,420
Here's the plan, Sandins.

494
00:34:54,337 --> 00:34:55,623
You have until our
provisions arrive,

495
00:34:55,697 --> 00:34:58,667
provisions which will help us
break into your elegant home.

496
00:35:00,697 --> 00:35:02,142
If you don't..

497
00:35:03,097 --> 00:35:04,940
If you don't deliver him
by the aforementioned time,

498
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:07,185
we'll release
the beast on him..

499
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:10,702
And on you.

500
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:15,419
And, um, we can enter
any home we want.

501
00:35:15,497 --> 00:35:20,458
And we will want as wanting is
our will on this fine night.

502
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:24,859
Don't force us to hurt you.

503
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:27,346
We don't want to kill our own.

504
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:32,822
Please, just let us Purge.

505
00:35:35,497 --> 00:35:37,499
Toodle-00, Sandins.

506
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,297
Cut it. Cut it now.

507
00:36:00,297 --> 00:36:02,538
The monitors are
working on backup.

508
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:04,708
The power's out
in the whole house.

509
00:36:06,057 --> 00:36:07,388
MARY: James, they can't
get in here, right?

510
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,664
They can't get
into our home.

511
00:36:09,737 --> 00:36:10,863
I don't know.

512
00:36:11,097 --> 00:36:12,428
It's hard to say.

513
00:36:12,497 --> 00:36:14,226
You don't know?

514
00:36:14,817 --> 00:36:16,546
You sell these
security systems.

515
00:36:16,617 --> 00:36:17,982
What do you mean,
you don't know?

516
00:36:18,057 --> 00:36:21,300
We have tested the system. It
works 99 percent of the time.

517
00:36:21,377 --> 00:36:23,903
It looks good. It's strong.
People stay away.

518
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:25,777
It looks good?

519
00:36:25,857 --> 00:36:28,258
It's not built
for worst-case scenarios.

520
00:36:28,337 --> 00:36:31,705
Is it impenetrable?
No, nothing's impenetrable.

521
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,981
Things like this are not supposed
to happen in our neighborhood.

522
00:36:36,057 --> 00:36:38,344
Well, they are
happening, James.

523
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:41,023
They're happening right now.
Do you see this?

524
00:36:45,657 --> 00:36:47,898
Okay, listen, just sit down.
Sit down, please.

525
00:36:47,977 --> 00:36:49,786
We gotta calm down.
Sit down.

526
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:52,578
All right. Sit down, sit down.
Listen.

527
00:36:53,017 --> 00:36:56,419
Okay, to answer your question,
yes, they could get in here.

528
00:36:57,137 --> 00:36:58,548
They could tunnel
underneath us.

529
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,028
They could smoke us out.

530
00:37:00,097 --> 00:37:03,101
They could devise
a battering ram, okay?

531
00:37:03,217 --> 00:37:06,664
I'm sorry, but it's true. So,
here's what we're gonna do.

532
00:37:08,137 --> 00:37:09,787
We're gonna give
them what they want.

533
00:37:10,657 --> 00:37:15,823
We're gonna find that man and
we're gonna force him outside.

534
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:22,305
Now, we have guns,
and he doesn't.

535
00:37:22,377 --> 00:37:25,301
But they'll kill him.

536
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:26,983
Why should he die?

537
00:37:27,057 --> 00:37:28,821
It's him or us, Charlie.

538
00:38:28,297 --> 00:38:30,743
FEMALE FREAK 1: Why don't you
give us the homeless man?

539
00:38:30,817 --> 00:38:33,343
FEMALE FREAK 2: No one will
miss him when he's gone.

540
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:36,068
FEMALE FREAK 1 AND 2:
Pretty please. (GIGGLING)

541
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,461
Wait a minute.

542
00:39:42,857 --> 00:39:44,461
Shit.

543
00:39:56,217 --> 00:39:57,628
Where is he?

544
00:40:20,657 --> 00:40:21,738
There he is.

545
00:41:12,897 --> 00:41:14,308
Look at me.

546
00:41:17,897 --> 00:41:19,899
Come on,
look over here.

547
00:42:25,537 --> 00:42:26,777
Where are you?

548
00:42:56,017 --> 00:42:57,143
Come on.

549
00:44:45,777 --> 00:44:48,178
(BANGING ON DOOR) POLITE
LEADER: Dear Mr. Sandin!

550
00:44:48,777 --> 00:44:51,906
Sorry to interrupt, but
I'd love to have a word.

551
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:56,625
Meet me by your front door. I
just need a moment, good sir.

552
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:07,466
There you are.

553
00:45:08,857 --> 00:45:11,178
Thank you for accepting
my invitation.

554
00:45:12,097 --> 00:45:15,385
Tell me, why haven't you delivered
the filthy swine to me yet?

555
00:45:16,857 --> 00:45:18,825
Are you protecting him?

556
00:45:20,177 --> 00:45:22,578
I surely hope not,
Mr. Sandin.

557
00:45:22,657 --> 00:45:24,546
JAMES: No. Of course not.

558
00:45:24,617 --> 00:45:25,903
We just can't find him.

559
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,698
You see,
this is a misunderstanding.

560
00:45:28,777 --> 00:45:30,302
My son let him in.

561
00:45:30,377 --> 00:45:32,220
He's a young boy.
He doesn't know better.

562
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:35,380
But I support what occurs here
tonight 100 percent, okay?

563
00:45:35,457 --> 00:45:37,346
(LAUGHING)
I sell security equipment.

564
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:39,226
So, I would
never deny yours,

565
00:45:39,297 --> 00:45:41,061
or anybody else's
right to Purge.

566
00:45:41,137 --> 00:45:44,983
Just give us the
homeless pig, you fuck!

567
00:45:50,937 --> 00:45:52,746
Sorry about that.

568
00:45:52,977 --> 00:45:54,900
I don't condone
that kind of behavior.

569
00:45:55,137 --> 00:45:57,663
Butjust keep in mind,
Mr. Sandin..

570
00:45:58,977 --> 00:46:00,820
He was my friend,

571
00:46:00,897 --> 00:46:03,662
and you are not.

572
00:46:06,577 --> 00:46:08,944
Our equipment
is arriving soon.

573
00:46:09,497 --> 00:46:11,340
And we will get in.

574
00:46:13,817 --> 00:46:15,865
Send out he,
or that..

575
00:46:16,617 --> 00:46:18,460
Will be thee.

576
00:46:21,857 --> 00:46:22,858
I'll go get him.

577
00:46:22,937 --> 00:46:24,462
You should do that.

578
00:47:20,657 --> 00:47:21,943
Hey, Charlie.

579
00:47:24,377 --> 00:47:26,823
I don't know
what's going on.

580
00:47:26,897 --> 00:47:29,184
There are people outside.

581
00:47:29,257 --> 00:47:30,338
Um..

582
00:47:32,537 --> 00:47:34,505
And Henry's dead.

583
00:47:35,737 --> 00:47:38,786
I'll be okay.
I have his gun.

584
00:47:39,177 --> 00:47:41,100
Stay where you are.

585
00:47:41,177 --> 00:47:43,145
Please be safe, okay?

586
00:47:44,657 --> 00:47:46,944
I'm going to go hide
in your secret spot.

587
00:47:47,177 --> 00:47:48,417
No.

588
00:47:49,737 --> 00:47:51,421
All right? I love you.

589
00:48:15,737 --> 00:48:16,818
Don't.

590
00:48:17,457 --> 00:48:18,458
Zoey.

591
00:48:19,617 --> 00:48:21,142
Get back.

592
00:48:22,497 --> 00:48:24,340
Into the hall.
Let's go.

593
00:48:24,617 --> 00:48:26,301
Drop your gun-

594
00:48:27,017 --> 00:48:28,382
ZOEY: Dad, please.

595
00:48:32,337 --> 00:48:33,827
Drop it.

596
00:48:36,217 --> 00:48:37,378
JAMES: Don't hurt her.

597
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:39,664
BLOODY STRANGER:
Lower your weapon.

598
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:42,418
Zoey, I will not
let him hurt you.

599
00:48:42,497 --> 00:48:45,580
Leave her alone,
you son of a bitch.

600
00:48:45,857 --> 00:48:47,780
I will let her go
when this night is over.

601
00:48:47,857 --> 00:48:49,268
You're gonna get us
all killed. You know that.

602
00:48:49,337 --> 00:48:51,419
They're coming in here, and
they are gonna kill us all.

603
00:48:51,817 --> 00:48:53,660
They are gonna come in here,
and they are.. Back up.

604
00:48:54,497 --> 00:48:56,738
You got to leave my
family out of this. Okay?

605
00:48:56,817 --> 00:48:57,978
If you don't
drop your gun,

606
00:48:58,097 --> 00:48:59,906
I will hurt her
and I will hurt you.

607
00:49:00,017 --> 00:49:01,621
We didn't do
anything to you.

608
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:04,980
We don't deserve this. I
don't deserve this either.

609
00:49:05,057 --> 00:49:06,866
Now, listen, I don't
want to hurt any of you,

610
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:11,308
but I am not
dying tonight!

611
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:15,858
Drop your gun-

612
00:49:15,937 --> 00:49:17,268
Please.
Drop it.

613
00:49:18,657 --> 00:49:19,988
Put the gun down.

614
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,185
Listen to me.
Okay.

615
00:49:22,657 --> 00:49:24,341
You are going
to die tonight.

616
00:49:24,737 --> 00:49:26,978
And you can either
die like a man,

617
00:49:27,057 --> 00:49:29,105
and walk outside
there by yourself,

618
00:49:29,177 --> 00:49:30,941
or you can die
like a coward

619
00:49:31,017 --> 00:49:34,180
and get my wife and my children
killed along with you.

620
00:49:34,257 --> 00:49:37,545
Okay? So take that gun away
from my daughter's head!

621
00:49:37,857 --> 00:49:39,222
Shoot him, Mary! Shoot him!

622
00:49:47,377 --> 00:49:49,186
Get off me!

623
00:49:53,777 --> 00:49:55,188
Stop!

624
00:49:55,497 --> 00:49:57,101
Shit. Shit.

625
00:49:57,937 --> 00:49:59,462
Mary? Mary!

626
00:49:59,577 --> 00:50:00,578
Zoey!

627
00:50:00,657 --> 00:50:03,263
She's unconscious. She hit her head.


628
00:50:09,857 --> 00:50:11,382
JAMES: Mary, are you okay?

629
00:50:12,897 --> 00:50:14,899
We got to get some rope.
What?

630
00:50:15,057 --> 00:50:17,947
Mary, we have
to get some rope

631
00:50:18,017 --> 00:50:21,180
and we have to tie him up
and get him outside.

632
00:50:21,297 --> 00:50:23,061
And we're gonna end
this goddamn night.

633
00:50:23,257 --> 00:50:24,861
All right?
Do you hear me?

634
00:50:24,977 --> 00:50:26,422
Okay. Okay

635
00:50:27,337 --> 00:50:29,499
All right. Come on,
Charlie, help me.

636
00:50:29,577 --> 00:50:30,942
Sweetheart?

637
00:50:31,937 --> 00:50:33,382
Sweetheart?

638
00:50:34,737 --> 00:50:38,583
Okay, I'm almost done here. As
soon as you get the legs secure..

639
00:50:38,777 --> 00:50:41,178
You got it? All right, let me see.
Let me see. Good job.

640
00:50:41,417 --> 00:50:43,021
You're doing great,
honey.

641
00:50:43,097 --> 00:50:45,668
Here's what we're gonna do. We're
gonna roll him into that chair,

642
00:50:45,897 --> 00:50:47,023
and we're gonna
drag him outside

643
00:50:47,097 --> 00:50:48,223
and we're gonna
be done, all right?

644
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:50,100
Mmm-hmm. You got it?
All right, we ready?

645
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,828
Charlie, just concentrate
on your sister, okay?

646
00:50:53,897 --> 00:50:55,467
See if she's waking up.

647
00:50:55,737 --> 00:50:57,227
Except, Charlie,
I need the light.

648
00:50:57,297 --> 00:50:59,186
Thank you, son. Okay.

649
00:50:59,377 --> 00:51:01,698
Hey, good job.
You're doing great.

650
00:51:01,777 --> 00:51:03,381
All right. Let me get
the chair, here.

651
00:51:03,457 --> 00:51:05,459
Okay,
we are almost done.

652
00:51:06,857 --> 00:51:08,666
I'm gonna pick him up on the
count of three, all right?

653
00:51:08,737 --> 00:51:09,704
You're gonna help me.

654
00:51:09,777 --> 00:51:13,065
Keep the light on us, Charlie.
Ready? One, two..

655
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:14,218
Three!

656
00:51:17,217 --> 00:51:18,742
JAMES: Okay.

657
00:51:18,817 --> 00:51:22,060
Great. Now, let's get the
tape and tape him in there.

658
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,737
Whoa!
Hey,hey,hey!

659
00:51:24,817 --> 00:51:26,899
I've got him, I've got him.

660
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:29,265
Okay. Okay, all right!

661
00:51:30,217 --> 00:51:32,265
You got to calm down. He's
gonna break this tape!

662
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,100
Press on his wound.
What?

00:51:35,337 --> 00:51:37,544
Get the letter opener
and press on his wound!

00:51:38,657 --> 00:51:40,102

Grab the letter opener!

666
00:51:42,657 --> 00:51:43,863
No, Mom!

667
00:51:44,257 --> 00:51:47,067
Listen to me. lam just
trying to protect my family.

668
00:51:50,097 --> 00:51:51,428
Just calm down.

669
00:51:52,617 --> 00:51:53,618
Mom!

670
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,938
JAMES: Come on, do it.

671
00:51:55,017 --> 00:51:56,303
Do it, Mary!
Do it!

672
00:51:56,377 --> 00:51:57,663
Press on his wound!

673
00:51:58,017 --> 00:51:59,257
JAMES: Yes!

674
00:51:59,337 --> 00:52:00,338
Mom!

675
00:52:00,697 --> 00:52:01,698
You want her
to do it again?

676
00:52:01,777 --> 00:52:02,744
Mom, stop!

677
00:52:02,857 --> 00:52:05,144
JAMES: Just do it again, Mary.

678
00:52:06,537 --> 00:52:08,141
Okay. All right.

679
00:52:08,577 --> 00:52:10,978
Okay. Ready to sit
in the chair?

680
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:14,908
Yeah, he's ready.
Help me up. Help me up.

681
00:52:16,617 --> 00:52:19,348
Ready? Okay.

682
00:52:24,777 --> 00:52:26,745
Stay there, all right?
Stop it.

683
00:52:26,817 --> 00:52:28,819
Just let me take you
in this chair. All right?

684
00:52:28,897 --> 00:52:30,820
Mary, where's the tape?

685
00:52:35,057 --> 00:52:38,459
You are making this much more
difficult than it needs to be.

686
00:52:38,537 --> 00:52:40,460
You understand me? Huh?

687
00:52:52,217 --> 00:52:53,662
Christ, look at us.
Look at this man.

688
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:54,977
Look at what
we're doing to him.

689
00:53:03,737 --> 00:53:04,738
Come on, Mary.

690
00:53:04,817 --> 00:53:06,546
Let's get this over with.

691
00:53:10,417 --> 00:53:11,748
Come on, Mary.

692
00:53:20,377 --> 00:53:21,503
It's okay, Mary.

693
00:53:21,857 --> 00:53:23,222
I can't.
Oh, yes, you can.

694
00:53:23,297 --> 00:53:25,299
I need you right now,
okay?

695
00:53:25,377 --> 00:53:29,098
Hey, look at me. Huh?
Look at me, Mary.

696
00:53:29,657 --> 00:53:31,307
Mary.

697
00:53:31,377 --> 00:53:33,948
It's wrong. It's so wrong.
We don't have a choice.

698
00:53:34,737 --> 00:53:35,704
This is so wrong.

699
00:53:35,777 --> 00:53:36,983
We don't have
any other choice.

700
00:53:37,057 --> 00:53:39,537
Don't touch me.
Look at you.

701
00:53:40,737 --> 00:53:43,468
No,no,no.
Don't touch me.

702
00:53:45,257 --> 00:53:46,782
When did this happen?

703
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,701
James, look at you.

704
00:53:54,617 --> 00:53:56,540
What the hell
happened to us, James?

705
00:53:58,657 --> 00:53:59,988
Charlie.

706
00:54:01,457 --> 00:54:05,064
Charlie? Baby, where did you go?
Charlie?

707
00:54:10,817 --> 00:54:12,148
Charlie!

708
00:54:13,177 --> 00:54:15,020
Charlie,
where are you, baby?

709
00:54:15,097 --> 00:54:16,986
Charlie!

710
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:37,181
Zoey. Hey,
are you all right?

711
00:54:37,977 --> 00:54:39,183
Sit down, sit down.

712
00:54:39,257 --> 00:54:41,703
You hit your head.
Are you okay?

713
00:54:41,817 --> 00:54:43,103
Oh, God.

714
00:54:46,577 --> 00:54:51,105
I am so sorry
about Henry, okay?

715
00:54:51,297 --> 00:54:52,822
I'm so sorry.

716
00:54:52,897 --> 00:54:54,865
But we're gonna make it
through tonight, all right?

717
00:54:54,937 --> 00:54:58,623
We will, and everything
is gonna be okay.

718
00:54:59,497 --> 00:55:01,499
It's not gonna be okay.

719
00:55:02,217 --> 00:55:03,298
What?

720
00:55:03,377 --> 00:55:05,857
Look at what
you're doing.

721
00:55:06,617 --> 00:55:09,905
Nothing is ever
going to be okay again.

722
00:55:11,697 --> 00:55:14,428
Don't say that.

723
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:35,740
Save your children.

724
00:55:37,537 --> 00:55:39,221
Take me outside.

725
00:56:02,137 --> 00:56:04,743
Charlie? Charlie!

726
00:56:12,977 --> 00:56:16,060
POLITE LEADER: I want all
these barricades down!

727
00:56:16,137 --> 00:56:19,744
Get chains on every
door and every window!

728
00:56:23,897 --> 00:56:24,978
James, where's Zoey?

729
00:56:25,057 --> 00:56:26,024
I don't know,
she ran out here.

730
00:56:26,097 --> 00:56:27,701
Those freaks outside
are coming in!

731
00:56:27,777 --> 00:56:29,347
They have chains on the
doors and windows.

732
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:31,385
They're gonna pull them
off and come inside.

733
00:56:31,457 --> 00:56:32,538
Maybe you were right.

734
00:56:32,617 --> 00:56:35,018
No, I wasn't right
about anything.

735
00:56:35,857 --> 00:56:38,428
You're not
sending him outside?

736
00:56:39,177 --> 00:56:40,702
I have another idea.

737
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:41,824
CHARLIE:
What are you gonna do?

738
00:56:42,137 --> 00:56:43,548
BOTH: Charlie!

739
00:56:43,617 --> 00:56:45,699
Charlie, listen to me.

740
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,222
You take this gun.

741
00:56:47,297 --> 00:56:48,708
Dad, are you
sending him outside?

742
00:56:48,817 --> 00:56:49,818
No. All right?

743
00:56:49,897 --> 00:56:51,342
You're gonna go hide
in the basement

744
00:56:51,417 --> 00:56:53,226
and you're not gonna come
out for anybody, all right?

745
00:56:53,297 --> 00:56:54,742
Okay.
You're a good boy.

746
00:56:54,817 --> 00:56:56,581
All right, go,go

747
00:56:56,657 --> 00:56:58,227
You just gave
our son a gun.

748
00:56:58,297 --> 00:57:00,948
You want to tell me
what the hell we're doing?

749
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:02,826
We're gonna fight.

750
00:57:07,577 --> 00:57:10,786
I want you to take this one as well.
Safety's off.

751
00:57:11,217 --> 00:57:12,582
You're gonna use
a lot of rounds.

752
00:57:12,657 --> 00:57:14,261
What do I do?

753
00:57:14,337 --> 00:57:16,339
You're gonna cover the
other side of the house.

754
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:18,306
This is our home.
Our kids live here.

755
00:57:18,377 --> 00:57:20,027
Anybody tries to come
in, you blast them.

756
00:57:20,097 --> 00:57:21,826
You will not hesitate.
Mmm.

757
00:57:26,097 --> 00:57:28,259
POLITE LEADER:
Dear Mr. and Mrs.!

758
00:57:28,657 --> 00:57:33,185
I'm sorry to tell you this, but
your time is essentially up.

759
00:57:34,257 --> 00:57:35,861
And you failed!

760
00:57:36,697 --> 00:57:39,940
You failed to deliver
the homeless swine!

761
00:57:42,057 --> 00:57:46,824
I'm very disappointed as you
fine folk should know better!

762
00:57:46,897 --> 00:57:50,060
That piece of filth
that you are protecting

763
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:54,028
exists only to serve
our need to Purge!

764
00:57:59,257 --> 00:58:03,740
So, I bid thee farewell, sweet Sandins.

765
00:58:04,497 --> 00:58:07,899
Release the beast, boys.
Let the killing commence!

766
00:58:16,097 --> 00:58:17,383
POLITE LEADER: Run!

767
01:01:38,457 --> 01:01:39,947
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

768
01:01:40,017 --> 01:01:42,099
Are you hurt?
No, I'm okay.

769
01:01:42,577 --> 01:01:44,067
We've got
to get out of here.

770
01:01:44,137 --> 01:01:45,548
Come on,
come on, come on.

771
01:02:33,537 --> 01:02:37,144
POLITE LEADER: Cooper, come
look at little lady Sandin.

772
01:02:38,297 --> 01:02:40,664
She's exquisite.

773
01:02:41,577 --> 01:02:43,500
Save her for me.

774
01:02:46,697 --> 01:02:48,062
Dad.

775
01:02:48,177 --> 01:02:50,783
Are you okay?
Yes, Dad, I'm okay.

776
01:02:50,857 --> 01:02:52,097
You stay here, okay?

777
01:02:52,177 --> 01:02:53,417
Are Mommy and Zoey okay?

778
01:02:53,497 --> 01:02:55,147
Yeah,
they're gonna be fine.

779
01:03:43,897 --> 01:03:45,228
Mmm..

780
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:55,298
Shit.

781
01:04:10,377 --> 01:04:11,583
Shit!

782
01:06:07,657 --> 01:06:09,659
It's okay.

783
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,622
It's okay.

784
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:17,461
Your soul has been
cleansed, Mr. Sandin.

785
01:06:17,537 --> 01:06:19,266
You've Purged.

786
01:06:20,617 --> 01:06:22,267
Just one question for you.

787
01:06:22,737 --> 01:06:25,058
Was his life
really worth yours?

788
01:06:28,177 --> 01:06:29,941
Your family's?

789
01:06:33,377 --> 01:06:36,506
Thank you for this unforgettable
Purge, Mr. Sandin.

790
01:08:16,857 --> 01:08:20,418
No!No!No!

791
01:08:21,737 --> 01:08:23,944
Get off!
Get off of me!

792
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:25,462
James!

793
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:29,866
Let go of me!
Please, don't!

794
01:08:30,257 --> 01:08:32,737
Please don't kill me.
Please don't!

795
01:08:33,337 --> 01:08:34,623
James!

796
01:08:34,697 --> 01:08:35,937
Please, don't!
Please, don't!

797
01:08:36,017 --> 01:08:37,064
Please!

798
01:08:37,657 --> 01:08:38,658
James!

799
01:08:39,137 --> 01:08:40,298
James!

800
01:08:40,377 --> 01:08:42,027
Please!
Please, don't!

801
01:08:42,177 --> 01:08:43,667
Don't! Please don't!

802
01:09:29,057 --> 01:09:30,388
James.

803
01:09:32,617 --> 01:09:34,142
James.

804
01:09:35,737 --> 01:09:37,501
Charlie! Charlie!

805
01:09:37,577 --> 01:09:39,067
Zoey!

806
01:09:42,697 --> 01:09:44,267
Dad!

807
01:09:45,897 --> 01:09:47,387
Sorry.

808
01:09:55,777 --> 01:09:57,267
Thank you
for your sacrifice.

809
01:09:58,657 --> 01:10:00,978
You got a lot
of heart, Mr. Sandin.

810
01:10:02,177 --> 01:10:03,781
Blessed be America..

811
01:10:05,817 --> 01:10:08,343
A nation reborn.

812
01:10:28,737 --> 01:10:32,901
I'm so sorry.

813
01:11:17,177 --> 01:11:18,747
Thank you.

814
01:11:19,417 --> 01:11:21,738
We saw that you were
having some trouble.

815
01:11:21,857 --> 01:11:23,507
We decided to help you.

816
01:11:25,977 --> 01:11:28,184
You saved us.
I don't know what to say.

817
01:11:32,817 --> 01:11:35,184
Don't thank us
too much, Mary.

818
01:11:37,257 --> 01:11:39,498
The truth is, you're
ours, not theirs.

819
01:11:40,457 --> 01:11:41,947
What do you mean "ours"?

820
01:11:42,017 --> 01:11:43,507
What do you mean?
What do you mean "ours"?

821
01:11:44,057 --> 01:11:45,058
CHARLIE: Dad?

822
01:11:45,137 --> 01:11:46,377
No,no,no!
Dad!

823
01:11:47,257 --> 01:11:48,258
MARY: Wait! Wait!

824
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:49,338
Dad!

825
01:11:52,617 --> 01:11:53,948
James is dead.

826
01:11:54,697 --> 01:11:56,506
Mary and the kids
will have to do.

827
01:11:56,577 --> 01:11:59,262
Let's tie them up. We'll
kill them right here.

828
01:11:59,577 --> 01:12:01,898
No,no,no.
What do you mean?

829
01:12:01,977 --> 01:12:03,342
Wait! Wait! Wait!

830
01:12:03,417 --> 01:12:04,942
GRACE: Come on.
No! No!

831
01:12:05,017 --> 01:12:06,098
No!

832
01:12:06,217 --> 01:12:08,265
No!No!No!

833
01:12:08,337 --> 01:12:10,021
CHARLIE: Mom! Mom!

834
01:12:11,817 --> 01:12:13,023
Cali, get the tape!

835
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:16,825
Don't touch
my fucking children!

836
01:12:16,897 --> 01:12:18,740
Don't you touch
my fucking kids!

837
01:12:20,337 --> 01:12:22,817
MARY: Let them go!
Let them go!

838
01:12:22,897 --> 01:12:25,662
Right now! You let
my fucking kids go!

839
01:12:25,737 --> 01:12:27,739
Shut UP, Mary!
Shut up!

840
01:12:27,817 --> 01:12:28,978
Right now!

841
01:12:29,057 --> 01:12:30,297
Mary! Shut up!

842
01:12:35,777 --> 01:12:36,903
Do you hear me?

843
01:12:45,577 --> 01:12:48,262
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?

844
01:12:48,337 --> 01:12:49,623
Why are you doing
this right now?

845
01:12:50,177 --> 01:12:51,508
When your barricades
came down,

846
01:12:51,577 --> 01:12:55,946
we saw an opportunity to cleanse
ourselves of our hatred.

847
01:12:56,017 --> 01:12:57,826
You made so much
money off of us

848
01:12:57,897 --> 01:13:00,468
and then you just
stuck it in our faces.

849
01:13:01,097 --> 01:13:03,464
You all think
you're so damn perfect.

850
01:13:04,257 --> 01:13:07,420
I just need you
to listen to me, Grace.

851
01:13:07,497 --> 01:13:08,862
I'm really begging
you right now.

852
01:13:08,937 --> 01:13:10,905
Do not do this to
my children, please.

853
01:13:10,977 --> 01:13:12,741
They're my children,
please.

854
01:13:12,817 --> 01:13:14,581
Please, not my children.

855
01:13:14,657 --> 01:13:17,137
I can't let you do that.

856
01:13:17,697 --> 01:13:20,860
We have to, Mary. That's what
this night is all about.

857
01:13:21,137 --> 01:13:24,823
I am begging you.
I'm really begging you.

858
01:13:24,937 --> 01:13:27,827
I can't let you do this.

859
01:13:27,897 --> 01:13:32,346
We'll be better people and you'll
have sacrificed yourselves

860
01:13:32,417 --> 01:13:34,306
to make the world
a better place.

861
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:35,617
CHARLIE; Mom..

862
01:13:35,937 --> 01:13:36,904
Mom!

863
01:13:36,977 --> 01:13:38,706
You're frightening them.

864
01:13:39,257 --> 01:13:40,907
Please don't.

865
01:13:40,977 --> 01:13:42,627
Please let me
hold my children.

866
01:13:42,697 --> 01:13:45,268
Mary, no, no.
It's over.

867
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:46,463
Untie them.
It's over.

868
01:13:46,537 --> 01:13:48,460
Please untie my hands.
Hmm?

869
01:13:49,417 --> 01:13:50,543
Grace?

870
01:13:50,817 --> 01:13:52,626
It's time for you
to quiet down, Mary,

871
01:13:52,697 --> 01:13:55,177
and let us do
our duty as Americans.

872
01:13:59,897 --> 01:14:02,298
Mom.

873
01:14:06,217 --> 01:14:08,060
Sweetheart..
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

874
01:14:08,497 --> 01:14:12,024
Zoey, look at me, okay?
Just look at your mama.

875
01:14:12,097 --> 01:14:14,020
Just look at me.
Just look at me.

876
01:14:14,097 --> 01:14:17,419
ALL: Blessed be
the New Founding Fathers

877
01:14:17,497 --> 01:14:21,388
for letting us Purge
and cleanse our souls.

878
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,947
Blessed be America..

879
01:14:28,657 --> 01:14:32,867
Blessed be America,
a nation reborn.

880
01:14:33,377 --> 01:14:35,106
I'll go first
and then..

881
01:14:35,377 --> 01:14:36,947
We'll take turns.

882
01:14:42,697 --> 01:14:43,778
Timmy?

883
01:14:52,137 --> 01:14:53,707
Don't move.

884
01:14:55,937 --> 01:14:57,780
Drop your weapons
right now.

885
01:14:58,377 --> 01:15:00,027
Untie them,
let's go.

886
01:15:00,097 --> 01:15:01,258
Right now.

887
01:15:19,057 --> 01:15:20,547
Your call.

888
01:15:27,297 --> 01:15:29,186
Just get it over with.

889
01:15:29,897 --> 01:15:31,626
Kill us quickly.

890
01:15:33,817 --> 01:15:35,023
No.

891
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:37,459
Oh, for God's sake!
Just do it!

892
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:39,221
Come on!

893
01:15:41,057 --> 01:15:42,343
Mom, they were going to kill us.

894
01:15:42,417 --> 01:15:43,942
It doesn't matter.

895
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:48,462
We are gonna play the rest of this
night out in motherfucking peace.

896
01:15:50,137 --> 01:15:52,378
Does anyone have
a problem with that?

897
01:16:36,657 --> 01:16:39,308
Did you enjoy
Grace's Purge party..

898
01:16:40,337 --> 01:16:42,180
Mr. Halverson?

899
01:16:43,657 --> 01:16:44,783
Go fuck yourself.

900
01:16:44,857 --> 01:16:46,666
Sorry,
I can't hear you.

901
01:16:49,577 --> 01:16:51,579
It was very nice.

902
01:16:51,657 --> 01:16:52,897
Oh, good.

903
01:16:54,137 --> 01:16:56,424
I'm glad you all
had a grand time.

904
01:17:16,537 --> 01:17:19,984
Didn't you hear what I said?
No more killing tonight!

905
01:17:20,697 --> 01:17:23,348
Is it that hard
to understand?

906
01:17:37,577 --> 01:17:39,625
Oh, my.. 

907
01:17:44,777 --> 01:17:47,462
Now get the hell
out of my house.

908
01:18:09,257 --> 01:18:10,304
Wait.

909
01:18:16,017 --> 01:18:17,940
Are you going
to be okay?

910
01:18:20,777 --> 01:18:22,541
Thank you.

911
01:18:27,257 --> 01:18:28,907
Good luck.

FEMALE ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: Just
after 7:00 AM, March 22nd,

the Annual Purge

915
01:19:24,257 --> 01:19:27,067
This is your American
morning news program.

916
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:29,504
And reports are coming in
from all around the country

917

this was the most
successful Purge yet.

01:19:38,337 --> 01:19:39,668
MALE REPORTER:
I am walking..

921
01:19:39,737 --> 01:19:42,980
I should say "stumbling"
through downtown Los Ange/es,

922
01:19:43,057 --> 01:19:46,027
and there are literally
bodies everywhere.

923
01:19:46,097 --> 01:19:47,542
MALE CMLIAN 1: I witnessed
a group of young men

924
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:48,857
breaking into
the tenement next to me,

925
01:19:48,937 --> 01:19:50,780
and they were
dragging people out

926
01:19:50,857 --> 01:19:53,337
and just executing
them on the street.

927
01:19:53,417 --> 01:19:55,738
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Hundreds
have gathered in Times Square

928
01:19:55,817 --> 01:19:57,103
for a public vigil

929
01:19:57,177 --> 01:19:59,544
thanking all those
who were killed last night

930
01:19:59,617 --> 01:20:03,338
for their sacrifice to make
this country a safer place.

931

MALE CMLIAN 2:
They are turning people away

932
01:20:05,097 --> 01:20:06,940
from emergency rooms
in Brownsville

933
01:20:07,017 --> 01:20:09,463
as there is simply
no more room.

934
01:20:09,537 --> 01:20:10,948
MALE ANNOUNCER 2: The markets
were up this morning

935
01:20:11,017 --> 01:20:13,543

940
01:20:25,217 --> 01:20:27,219
while our thoughts
are still fresh.

941
01:20:27,297 --> 01:20:31,302
From what I've been reading, it seems
like Dallas had the most participants.

942
01:20:31,377 --> 01:20:34,381
I did get a chance to see some
live surveillance footage

943
01:20:34,457 --> 01:20:36,459
out of Dallas, Forest Lawn,

944
01:20:36,577 --> 01:20:39,387
and there had to be 200
people in the town square

945
01:20:39,497 --> 01:20:41,022
Purging at the same time.

946
01:20:41,097 --> 01:20:43,145
Never saw
anything like this.

Yeah, I was
a proud American.

950
01:20:49,737 --> 01:20:50,977
Not anymore.

951
01:20:51,057 --> 01:20:53,981
This country has taken
everything from me.
