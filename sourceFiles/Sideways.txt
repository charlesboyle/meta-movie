I am Paul Giamatti.

- Good times.

Excellent times, Paul.

11
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:03,447
- I think that's where we're headed.
- These are the ones we'll look back on.

to remember where we were.

And you determined
for me that we were...

19
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:32,184
lensing this scene in Santa Barbara,
but it's meant to be San Diego.

20
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:35,846
Up the coast a little ways
from San Diego.

Somebody was saying to me recently, isn't
it interesting that the first thing

32
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,133
you see me doing is lying
in this picture?

33
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,302
And it's a picture
about lying, isn't it?

34
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:18,898
It is, in fact, a picture
laden with canards...

35
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:23,319
as the great Samuel Beckett
would've proclaimed.

where I'm completely naked...

but cleverly hiding my genitals
behind a thick, green stripe.

- "Croissant."
- Yep.

- Always loved that.
- A little English on the ball.

- Rolfe Kent.
- Provided the poppy jazz we're hearing.

to get this shot...

There it is.

See? There's a couple of those
shots in the movie...

48
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:06,937
where we tried to time it with the airplane,
and I put my life in grave risk...

49
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:09,240
to get that shot down.

50
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:13,110
Because I'm all about the movie being
as good as it could possibly be.

51
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:18,657
Now, many journalists
have noted that Miles...

52

confident doing...

puzzle that he used a pen.

oblivious idiot I am.

00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:33,505
I never even realized. I never thought
of that. "I was using a pen."

56
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:36,925

me and did what I was told.

- Well...
- But you're absolutely right.

- You embraced la pluma.

Indeed, indeed.

60
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,602
But it's that kind of character
detail that makes this...

61
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,939
That they forced... That the Props
Department forced upon you.

62
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,868
Exactly. Thank God
for the prop people.

remember her name...

- In the homeland of Armenia.

00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,818
But now she's in America.

- but tasty.
- But effervescent.

137
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:45,090
Yeah, right. There was a lot of trying
to get corked bottles open in this movie.

- That was a big pain in the neck.
- And I had the...

- Denise. Sweet, sweet Denise.
- Denise.

- Oh, Denise. "Proppy."
- "Proppy."

and the bottles in the same box.

- Oh, right.
- And I was fumbling.

- Right.
- I think to...

- I was fumbling with the box.
- Well, especially champagne too.

You're the devil...

00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:32,730
You're the Underwood deviled-ham
guy of incredulity in this scene.

153
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:37,142
Absolutely right. I just need
a tiny pitchfork, you're right.

154
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:39,477
- I am the Underwood...
- All you need is a trident.

155
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,896
I look like the Underwood
deviled-ham man.

00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,399
Now, you just do a great
deadpan thing there. But...

But again, I have
to point out...

158
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,825
the motif of self-deceit
and mutual deceit...

159
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:55,535
- going on between us.
- Nice.

160
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,955
- This place was amazing.
- Now, this, I believe, was...

161
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:03,209
Paul, correct me if I am mistaken,
but wasn't this Santa Maria, California?

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,722
- I think you are dead-on, sir.
- Once again...

163
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:10,592
- we're deceiving the audience.
- Some amazing driving.

164
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:14,304
Wait, they... The movie proclaims
it to be Oxnard, California...

165
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:16,181
when it is, in fact,
Santa Maria.

166
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:18,016
So the movie itself...

167

me a good 15 takes to get right.

Nothing makes me more nervous than having
to lick an envelope on film.

it gets a very big laugh.

We shot this entire scene on a Friday

"We are so...

I love that kind of weird
detail with that thing.

00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,945
Yeah, no, it's true. And
I guess they thought:

"Well, is it too
unappealing?" or whatever.

- Right.
- I forgot about that.

331
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,858
That's from that movie
The Good Life?

332
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,570
- Is that what it was called?
- Was it The Good Life?

333
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,206
I think that's what it's called.

334
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,575
- However you say that in Italian.
- Vittorio Gassman.

335
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:58,661
- Yeah.
- And Jean-Louis Trintignant.

336
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,621
- And it's...
- But I remember, Alexander...

337
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,091
that shot, he loves...

338
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,585
- The flares.
- Yeah, the camera flares.

339
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:09,297
- He wanted it to look documentary-like.
- Like that, right there.

340
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:11,173
He wanted a documentary feel.

341
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:14,468
There was a camera very
precariously placed...

342
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,847
on a bad little wooden platform
on the back of the car.

343
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:20,308
It was the cheapest
thing I've ever seen.

344
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:23,704
It had, like, little grocery-cart
wheels on it.

345
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,605
And I was, like...

346
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:28,149
The Camera Department
was waiting for us to lose...

347
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,610
- a $165,000 camera.
- I would hear Phedon.

348
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:34,322
He would just scream at me, "Slow down!
Slow down! Slow down!"

349
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:37,992
- He was just rattling...
- Our Greco-Germanic...

350
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,703
- Is that what he is?
- He's Greek and German, isn't he?

351
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,788
- What a weird combo.
- I thought so.

352
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,708
No, you're right.
It's something like that.

353
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,418
Now, this is real vino here.

354
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:52,757
- This was at the great Sanford Winery.
- Nice recall.

355
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,885
I couldn't remember what it was called.
This is one of the...

356
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,605
fine organic vineyards, right?

357
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,483
Yes, I believe you're right.

358
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:05,102
Hopefully, that's not
product placement.

359
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:08,773
- We certainly show enough wine labels.
- Oh, God.

360
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,107
That's true.

361
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,735
- I don't think they'd object.
- I love this.

362
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,695
How many times did
I get wine up my nose?

363
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,864
Hold on. Wait a minute. Hold on.

364
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:19,575
Your face, it just
sells the whole thing.

365
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,577
- A "soupçon."
- "Soupçon."

366
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:24,413
There's a lot of French. It
didn't all end up in there.

367
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:27,416
And I threw out one,
"sans." That's all I...

368
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,418
- Nicely done.
- I got cracked for it.

369
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:30,586
- Did you?
- Alexander was like:

370
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,798
"I don't know if that's really
in character for Jack."

371
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,726
- But he left it in.
- Yeah, that's good.

372
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:40,763
I tell you, it's hard
spinning wine like that.

373
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,265
I did it the wimpy way,
by putting it on the table.

374
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:46,936
You're really supposed to keep
it off the table, I think.

375
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:49,030
- This is...
- Are we...?

376
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,491
My gasp of refreshment.

377
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,703
JACK: How would you
rate this one, Miles?

378
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,947
Usually they start you on wines
with learning disabilities.

COMMENTARY: I really went
with the sculpted facial hair.

- Chris.
- Chris. There's Chris.

381

- The great...
- The great pourer Chris.

382
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,589
You know, Chris...

383
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:09,709
- sent me two cases of wine.
- Did he really?

384
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,847
- Very nice folks up there.
- For the godparents of my daughter.

385
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,756
Oh, to the godparents
of your daughter?

386
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:20,469
- I thought you said Chris was...
- I requested it, and he sent two cases.

387
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,597
It'd be extreme to make Chris
your child's godfather.

388
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:28,445
I worked with him one day and asked
him to be the godfather of my child.

389
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:32,064
That's Pea Soup
Andersen's we just passed there.

390
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,376
This is Buellton, right?

391
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,527
- Buellton, California.
- Yes, sir.

392
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,738
- And we really shot there.
- We did.

393
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:43,176
Although I know they considered St.
Paul, Minnesota, as a stand-in.

394
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:46,046
As a location stand-in
for Buellton.

395
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:49,540
- And here we are.
- Here we go.

396
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,793
I always find it... Something
that was always touching to me...

397
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,379
about the fact
that we change for dinner.

398
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,714
- You know?
- Oh, yeah.

399
00:20:56,715 --> 00:21:00,634
There's something sweet about the fact
that these guys change for dinner.

400
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:04,981
You know, it's like... It's a very
kind of sweetly formal thing.

401
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:08,860
I love how Phedon...

402
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:13,731
filtered either... I don't know
if it's a polarizing lens.

403
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:18,962
But if you look at the way the headlights
are kind of softened and flared.

404
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,631
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I love that.

405
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:22,823
Look at that.

406
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:27,712
I'm working on a pair of perky
man-breasts, aren't I?

407
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:32,041
You do have man-cans
of the first order...

408
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,877
that America is enjoying,
as we speak.

It's my gift
to America, frankly.

- Never.

- But there's something really...

00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,778
- I love those rear... Those reverse shots.
- Yeah, it's funny.

417

Look at us. Eager
to get to the trough.

- Now, this man...
- Oh, yeah.

419
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:09,411
- Patrick Gallagher.
- Patrick Gallagher, sir.

420
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:13,332
Everybody that I know who's seen
this movie comments on this guy...

421
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:17,837
and says, "Now, come on, that guy
is amazing. He seems like the bartender."

422
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:20,172
You know why? And
I think part of it...

423
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:25,719
And we have to tip the old
casting cap to Sandra Oh...

424
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,782
because they were
college schoolmates.

425
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,474
Something like that, yes.

426
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:33,394
She... I believe they went
to school together in Canada.

427
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,980
- Acting school, yeah.
- But he, to me...

428
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:40,076
I think part of what makes him
so vivid is that he is of...

429
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,571
- What is he, Samoan descent?
- I'm not sure.

430
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:45,781
- He's half...
- But he's kind of uncharacteristic...

431
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,492
- Yes, right.
- For what is a pretty...

00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:51,120
Caucasoid community up there.

433
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,789
Pretty homogenous place,
for the most part.

434
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,835
You're right. I think he's, like,
half Japanese, half Russian...

435
00:22:57,836 --> 00:23:00,713
or something. Yeah, he's actually
got a lot of Russian blood.

436
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:04,985
You can see a hint of the Mongolian
steppe lands in his face.

437
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,354
And so I think
he's something like that.

438
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:13,642
I would have gone with Serbo-Croat,
but Mongolian steppe lands...

There's great paintings

- It was all this kind of garish...
- Western.

- Kind of surreal cowboy stuff.
- Yeah.

447
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,169
I always said the movie's kind
of a Western. Remember this?

448
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,672
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's like the two guys ride into town...

Ridiculous.

up as she comes walking over to me.

00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:17,085
I like the way you say that.
Very good.

493
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,921
It's good stuff here.

494
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,539
This was my favorite stuff
when I first read the script.

495
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,666
- Look at you.
- Looking at her...

496
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:29,305
while trying to make significant eye
contact, but failing miserably.

497
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,803
My favorite thing is...

498
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:38,972
your eyes kind of glaze
over a little bit when you do it.

499
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:42,851
It's very funny. You go slightly
dead inside when you do it.

500
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:45,771
- Oh, completely.
- Like you just can't quite...

501
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,231
Like you're a machine.

502
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:50,618
- Look at you. Look at you.
- It's just, like...

503
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:52,820
- Completely bemused.
- Yeah.

504
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,988
I've heard this how many times?

505
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:59,076
- But Virginia kept laughing every take.
- Well, it was funny in the take.

506
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:01,537
I go, "It can't still be
funny." She goes, "No."

507
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:04,665
She goes, "The look
in your eyes is killing me."

508
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,208
This is a great look too.

509
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:09,679
Both of us. It's a good...
It's funny. But you...

510
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:14,350
You go slightly dead, like a windup
toy, when you do it.

511
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,353
"Windmill."

512
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:19,355
Oh, boy.

513
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:22,984
I'm riding low
with my pants there.

514
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:24,726
Look at that.

515
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:30,527
On the man, you can't tell where his ass
begins and his lower spine starts.

516
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,693
Look at that. Jesus.

517
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:37,090
It's just the north face of K2,
on your back to your buttocks.

518
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:39,324
(COMMENTATORS LAUGHING)

519
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,877
Jesus.

520
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:43,579
- Oh, man.
- At any moment...

521
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,416
Uninterrupted, smooth connection
from spine to gluteus.

522
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:52,930
But at any moment, gnomes
will rappel down your backside.

523
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,559
And nestle in the warm,
downy hair.

524
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:02,356
- Unbelievable.
- That sits atop your French scoops.

525
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:05,401
Oh, your fleshy French scoops.

526
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,395
- Okay, now this was Solvang.
- This is Solvang.

527
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:11,481
The Danish town of Solvang.
There's a guy making aebelskivers.

528
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:13,400
- Look at that guy. Aebelskiver.
- Right?

529
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:16,320
- Isn't that what they were called?
- Exactly. Absolutely.

530
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:19,615
This place was great. Windmills.
There's windmills everywhere.

531
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,701
I don't know if I'm giving anything
away, but there's a motif.

532
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,828
I love your presentation here.

533
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,997
- Very pleased with myself.
- You're so excited.

534
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:29,041
But you're just...

535
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:32,336
There are chill winds blowing
from across the table.

536
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:35,806
- I love the indicating digit.
- Boom. I love it.

537
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:37,174
Just frosty.

538
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:40,844
But did you notice, though,
that you hold your finger up...

539
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:43,639
and then I give
you a thumb back?

540
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,433
You're looking somewhat
like Michael Landon in this scene.

541
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:49,779
Oh, word. Word.

542
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:52,031
Word, my brother.

543
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:55,609
- Look at him. Look at me.
- That's a hell of a shirt too.

544
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,319
You're like an Aztec god.

545
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,333
I remember the teamster
captain, Jeff?

546
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,701
- Was it Jeff?
- Yeah, the little guy?

547
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,496
He had that shirt. No,
the kind of big guy.

548
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:09,539
He had that shirt,
and he wore it a lot.

549
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,794
He liked it so much from this
scene, he bought one from Wardrobe.

550
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,921
- It's a hell of a shirt.
- No, no.

551
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:18,766
No, no. It's designed
for ugliness.

552
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:22,427
In the background,
it's Pinocchio, right?

553
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:25,222
- There's a portrait of us.
- It's supposed to be us.

554
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:27,349
- It was a caricature.
- There's Pinocchio...

555
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,602
- and the other kid with...
- We both have wooden noses.

556
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:34,564
Island of lost boys, or whatever,
when they grow the ass' ears, right?

557
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:38,068
- Yes.
- But don't we also have wooden noses?

558
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:41,363
Yeah, one of us has a... Yeah,
we both have noses growing.

559
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:45,042
And there's a wine... Spill
of wine behind us as well.

560
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:48,370
- That's a little inside...
- I love this music here, though.

561
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:50,414
- Is this the montage thing?
- Yeah.

562
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:51,623
- I love this.
- Here we go.

563
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:54,376
I didn't know this
was even gonna be in the film.

564
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:56,461
- Oh, there's...
- I love this.

565
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:59,682
- I like the music here very much.
- I do too.

566
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:06,517
I have to say, I thought Rolfe Kent
did an absolutely superior job.

567
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:10,359
- I mean, just superb.
- Indeed.

568
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:14,646
So many of the cues, they're
just so dead-on for whatever...

569
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:18,900
No matter how false the emotions
may be on-screen, you know...

570
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:22,904
- Yeah, yeah.
- There's a buoyant cue.

571
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:26,241
- At moments, it's kind of a counterpoint.
- A lot of the time, it's...

572
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:30,495
- You're right, it's counterpointed.
- Like that, I'm taking you to task...

573
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:35,459
for standing in my way, and he comes
up with this really kind of boppy thing.

574
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,919
The thing when I dump
the wine down my throat...

575
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,057
it's this very kind
of poppy, fun music.

576
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:44,593
- Look, there's the steer.
- There's the steer that I...

577
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:47,346
We just missed it, but the steer
that Sandra and Alexander...

578
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:49,264
were raising at their house.

579
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,600
- Yes.
- It's an orphan steer.

580
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:53,602
- Bless his heart.
- Alexander at one point asked...

581
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:56,897
if I would like to have
that steer shipped to Texas...

582
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:59,816
- to be on my ranch.
- You being a cattle baron.

583
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,535
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

584
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:07,416
I recommended they slice him
up into hamburgers and enjoy.

585
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:11,036
This stuff's great.
I mean, I love this.

586
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:16,291
Because seeing the actual process of it,
and all those guys, it's just great, man.

587
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,928
How they... The corking process.

00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:22,264

work done, I would say.

Now the temperature's rising.

- The Korean-Canadian beauty.
- I'm breaking out in a sweat of lust.

592
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:35,319
- From north of the 55th parallel.
- Canada's own.

594
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,369
She captures perfectly...

pourers do up there. That real kind of...

Kind of warily eyeing Jack.

flabby, overripe...

so hard to be seductive.

- And then she...
- This is a funny cut.

617
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:59,278
The cut to this is very funny.

618

- It's good stuff. Good sight gag.
- As I'm lumbering out here.

619
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:06,693
This was a whole thing. I had to reach
into your pocket, near your genitals...

620
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:10,206
to fish the keys out.
Made me uncomfortable.

621
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:13,700
- Or so you say.
- No, actually it was your back pocket.

Big debate about would he actually
ever have his keys in his back pocket?

- Look at the...
- Beautiful shot, though.

624
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,084
Oh, yeah. That
was a beautiful area.

625
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,754
- Now, that was Kalyra.
- Is it product placement?

626
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,923
- I don't think it is.
- All right.

627
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:30,342
- They're wineries.
- This is the oldest.

628
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:32,010
- Yes.
- Yes, the oldest rootstock.

629
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:35,722
- Rootstock from the early '60s.
- Thank you, sir. Correct.

I believe the...

631

You're rootstock
from the early '60s yourself.

00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:43,980
I am rootstock from the early '60s.
Yes, lam.

Here we go.

634
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:50,070
Beautiful. Lovely place, it really is.
This is the Firestone Vineyard.

635
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:52,906
- Firestone. And you lived...
- I lived in a home.

636
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:55,992
- I was housed on a...
- On campus.

637
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:58,119
- Correct, sir.
- On the Firestone campus.

638
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,758
Correct, sir. A lot of wildlife. A
lot of terrifying wildlife up there.

639
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:08,556
- At night, deer would nibble.
- All alone. Oh, that was the least of it.

640
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:10,632
- Look at that.
- I love that.

641
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:13,561
I love your hand gestures.
I really do.

642
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,763
- I'm like a Marcel Marceau.
- Look at you.

643
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:19,900
- Yeah, drinking it in.
- You've got a bit...

644
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:23,696
of the Wallace Beery
working right there.

645
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,940
Yeah? Gotcha.

646
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,400
- You're right.
- Got some Wally Beery going on.

647
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:31,963
I got a little dash of Wally
Beery in with the...

648
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:35,040
Oh, God, look at the size
of that schnoz.

649
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:39,494
- Dueling giant noses.
- Look at that.

650
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:42,006
That's pretty intensely close.

651
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:45,551
- Look at me. I am just a...
- Oh, dear.

652
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,554

Oh, come on. Yeah, really.
Like a young boy.

"Why didn't you tell
me about this before?"

662

Now this was... There
were stunt guys.

674

It was much steeper
than it looks, actually.

675
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,326
But he never uses
the stunt guys.

- Well, we filmed it.
- Yeah.

677
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:07,040
And they were actually just
too good at it, kind of.

678

Where they found my stunt
guy, I'll never know.

679
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,962
We had the perfect
balance of clumsiness.

- And, uh...

I'm gonna keep going
back to that.

- Here we go.

00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:26,142
That was a great... Remember how long
it...? They had a huge tracking shot.

685
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:30,188
- Yes, indeed. It took a lot of time.
- But look at that. Brilliantly used.

686
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:32,449
- It was.
- Perfectly used.

687
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,860

The use of the grape as...
You know, calms me down.

Sort of calms you down.
You fondle them and...

not go to the dark side"...

went black behind me...

there was, when you're staggering
from the table back...

818
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:35,738
I just wanna note that on...
I believe, on a number of takes...

819
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:38,157
Paul Giamatti
operated the camera.

820
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:41,119
- Oh, that's right.
- Because they wanted your POV.

821
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,788
I forgot about that.
I was indeed...

822
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:47,959
- I rather enjoyed that that night.
- I did enjoy that. I forgot about that.

823
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,627
I did. It
was a hand-held camera.

824
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,212
I just enjoyed watching
you operate the camera.

825
00:43:51,213 --> 00:43:55,642
They had a lot of guts giving me a camera.
I could've dropped it.

826
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:58,427
I don't know. Do you
actually see any of it?

827
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:02,348
I don't think we ever do see your POV.
I love that shot.

828
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:06,727
- Yeah, no, all this stuff with the phone...
- But look at the red.

829
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:09,814
Yeah. And you see my...
Good close-up look...

830
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:14,077
of my pitted nose.

831
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:19,574
Look at him. Perfectly
balanced...

832
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:24,579
between blurry...

833
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,876
Perfectly balanced between blurry
incontinence and...

834
00:44:29,877 --> 00:44:35,214
And passive-aggressive
I don't know what.

835
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:37,633
- I love this, though.
- The use of the phone...

836
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:40,928
all this stuff was great. It
was, again, really well-shot.

837
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:44,390
They just shot it beautifully. The
blurry background and everything.

838
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:49,312
But shooting on a long
lens with you in stark...

839
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:51,772
- Indeed.
- It's just brilliant.

840
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:56,319
I mean, but with you in, like, this
really sharp focus in the foreground.

841
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,072
- But drifting in and out of focus.
- It's a beautifully shot thing.

842
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:02,033
Really beautifully shot.

843
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:05,328
And I love... I don't remember. Did Phe...?
Do you remember...

844
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:07,371
was the lighting
particularly red?

845
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:09,957
- Maybe that's just the way they...
- The walls were red...

846
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:13,711
and I think they... It looks
like they did it on purpose, though.

847
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:16,714
- They may have color-timed it.
- To get a real fiery tone.

848
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:17,798
Yeah, I mean, they may have.

849
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:20,727
To further enhance
my ruddy complexion.

850
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:25,273
- Look at you.
- Yeah, oh, brother. Ken.

851
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,443
Ken.

852
00:45:29,228 --> 00:45:33,856
That's Jessica Hecht, the actual
actress on the other end of the phone.

853
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:38,152
I believe Alexander was actually doing
the lines when we shot the scene.

854
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:40,821
Putting on a high,
girlish voice.

855
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:42,916
And being my ex-wife.

856
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:50,289
I love that, though.
That's completely in a long lens.

857
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:53,334
- Yeah, no, it's amazing.
- With everything just completely...

858
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:56,304
Just washed-out back there.
It's cool.

859
00:45:56,588 --> 00:46:00,100
So you're much more
conversant with the cameras.

860
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:03,010
Well, because I directed a movie,
and I picked the lenses.

861
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:06,982
Correct. Thomas Haden Church
has helmed a motion picture.

862
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:10,819
Rolling Kansas. Is
that a product placement?

863
00:46:10,978 --> 00:46:12,520
- Well, it's on DVD.
- There we go.

864
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:16,190
But, no, my director
of photography...

865
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:18,609
made me aware of lenses...

866
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:22,363
and how you incorporate them
in the composition of a shot.

867
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:26,367
They had an interesting sort of thing
on the front of the camera...

868
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:30,788
that would bump into me, so I was bumping
the camera a lot of the time.

869
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,373
- Look at that.
- Here's a moment...

870
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:35,167
- Yes, sir.
- Where you actually slipped...

871
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:38,087
but they never really... He
didn't leave it on-screen.

872
00:46:38,088 --> 00:46:40,172
Because we all react to...

873
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:43,843
Yeah, you don't see me hit the chair
the same way. You're right.

874
00:46:43,844 --> 00:46:46,304
- Look at that tawny belly.
- Taut.

875
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:52,105
A taut, tawny stretch
of leonine skin.

876
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:55,030
- Hello. Whoops. Whoops.
- Oh, boy.

877
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,898
- Yet another...
- Laying into me.

878
00:46:57,899 --> 00:46:59,775
Yet another verbal spanking.

879
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:02,028
It's a great way
the way we switch off.

880
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:06,032
We pass the parental baton in this thing.
You know what I mean?

881
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:09,910
You become... You become
the authority figure.

882
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:13,006
- Avuncular.
- Yeah, avuncular. Nicely done.

883
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:19,763
JACK: I mean, you are blowing
a great opportunity here with Maya.

884
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:24,091
COMMENTARY: Not really
an F-word there.

885
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:29,892
No, but I like the kind of...
Just the lightly aspirated F.

886
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:34,310
JACK: And what was that 10-minute
lecture on, what, Vouvrays?

887
00:47:34,311 --> 00:47:37,104
Are you kidding me?
Who gives a fuck?

888
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:39,282
COMMENTARY: "Vouvrays."

889
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:47,073
You and I brought this back in.
The thing, remember?

890
00:47:47,074 --> 00:47:50,451
Did we? Were we supposed
to not have this?

891
00:47:50,452 --> 00:47:53,371
Remember Alexander, at one point,
wanted to take this out...

892
00:47:53,372 --> 00:47:55,122
and you and I liked it.

893
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:58,292
There were more references to me
screwing around on my wife.

894
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:01,921
Most of them are gone, which I think
is great that it's only once that...

895
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:03,631
- But I like it.
- Yeah, I do too.

896
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:07,968
- I mean, you spark back.
- It's an important point to make.

897
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:11,147
Yeah, and it's a good
point to make, and...

898
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:17,028
It also doesn't make
Victoria the bad guy.

899
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:20,689
It doesn't. You're right.

900
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,776
It puts more of the blame on me.
But of course...

901
00:48:23,777 --> 00:48:25,903
- Oh, brother.
- Oh, no.

902
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:28,289
- That's...
- Outrageous.

903
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,616
- That was... I remember that.
- Outrageous.

904
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:32,326
There was a sequence of us...

905
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:36,163
He basically just let
the camera go on you there.

906
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:39,208
- And just kept telling me to react.
- Jesus.

907
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:42,336
There must have been 52
different reactions.

908
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:43,838
I don't know how he picked one.

909
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,507
- You know what, he told me that they...
- There's comedy.

910
00:48:46,508 --> 00:48:49,218
There we go. Yes?
I didn't mean to...

911
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:51,271
No, no, no. He...

912
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:55,558
- I'm just so exasperated.
- Yeah, you're frozen with exasperation.

913
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:58,561
With your hoofy reluctance.

914
00:48:58,562 --> 00:49:00,780
(COMMENTATORS LAUGHING)

915
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:04,275
Now, here's a place again...

916
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:08,413
if I may be so bold as to comment
on the production design.

917
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:11,198
Although, they actually
improved this house.

918
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:14,502
Oh, they sure did.
I mean, it was...

919
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:17,997
It was like the Spahn
Ranch out there.

920
00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:20,308
It was hairy, yeah.

921
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,585
- At any moment.
- At any moment.

922
00:49:22,586 --> 00:49:26,755
I mean, the level of detail in this
house, in the physical environment...

923
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:30,259
And I think there were many Squeaky
Fromme references that night.

924
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,979
I think there were quite a few.
Quite a few.

925
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:36,399
Yeah, Charlie and the girls.

926
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:41,145
I like what Virginia does
here, when she pulls out...

927
00:49:41,146 --> 00:49:43,314
No, no, no. When she... Watch.

928
00:49:43,315 --> 00:49:47,985
She's like a 6-year-old
on Christmas morning.

929
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:50,029
- Look at her. Look at her.
- She's all like: "Yee!"

930
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,706
Good stuff.

931
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:55,326
A Richebourg. We mention
a Richebourg there.

932
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:59,222
Alexander said they drank
that Richebourg, and it was...

933
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:02,166
- That night?
- It was middling, he said.

934
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,501
I think it was too old.

935
00:50:03,502 --> 00:50:08,714
Andrew Murray. An Andrew
Murray Pinot was selected.

936
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:11,800
Andrew Murray, also
a winery that we shot at.

937
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:13,052
Correct, sir.

938
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:17,640
I think mostly second unit, right?
Did we ever shoot first unit there?

939
00:50:17,641 --> 00:50:21,185
I don't know. I'm trying
to remember which one that was.

940
00:50:21,186 --> 00:50:24,271
I remember being particularly
fond of Andrew Murray wines.

941
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:26,148
I remember that as well.

942
00:50:26,149 --> 00:50:29,401
I remember picking up the thing I do
where I stick my finger in my ear...

943
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:32,112
when I'm tasting the wines.
He would do that.

944
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:34,949
- Oh, he's the one.
- I saw him do that...

945
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:37,752
so I cleverly lifted it, and...

946
00:50:38,787 --> 00:50:42,057
I don't know why he did
that, but I guess...

947
00:50:42,082 --> 00:50:44,833
too much of the bouquet
was escaping...

948
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:47,127
through the holes
on the sides of his head.

949
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:50,765
- Through his eustachian tubes.
- Nicely done, doctor.

950
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:56,896
- Look at you. You look handsome there.
- Thank you, sir.

951
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:01,276
Look at you. Rakish.

952
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:06,823
Rakish. Yeah. Like
a Renaissance prince.

953
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:10,150
That sculpted beard. Look
at that sculpted beard.

954
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:12,287
- Absolutely.
- Yes, sir.

955
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:16,332
This was real wine. We were
drinking the real deal here.

956
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:21,662
And I remember Virginia saying
in several Q & A's that...

957
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:24,832
Now, did you shoot this scene
before the big scene or...?

958
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:27,501
- We shot this whole thing in sequence.
- In sequence?

959
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:30,004
Because I remember her
saying in a Q & A...

960
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:34,550
that she very much wanted to have
a little bit of a mellow kind of a...

961
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:36,510
Like a real mellow thing going.

962
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:38,178
- Yeah.
- Look at her.

963
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:41,098
I think Virginia's tremendous
in this scene.

964
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:45,862
In the whole sequence, but I love...
Because she completely... She...

965
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:50,941
- She badmintons...
- Wow!

966
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:53,027
I've got it, I'm following you.

967
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:55,038
Yes. She's just...

968
00:51:55,322 --> 00:51:59,366
the amateur Vintner's palette
right back at you.

969
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:02,202
She's got the... She
keeps the birdie aloft.

970
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:04,747
Well, she keeps you honest...

971
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,707
- Nice.
- In the scene.

972
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:09,209
Because you kind of play
it off in a politic way.

973
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,670
Correct. She plays it for real.

974
00:52:11,671 --> 00:52:14,131
- Yeah.
- You're absolutely right.

975
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:16,008
- You're right.
- You don't wanna insult...

976
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:19,637
Stephanie's meager trappings.

977
00:52:19,638 --> 00:52:24,558
Yeah, well, I'm just hemmed in by my...
Yeah, whatever.

978
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,278
Hemmed in by my doughy flesh.

if Miles is a good writer.

1146
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,946
I said, "No, I don't think
he's probably any good."

1147
01:02:20,947 --> 01:02:24,366
I said, "He's probably..."
If he was really bad...

1148
01:02:24,367 --> 01:02:27,702
he could just write, like,
Harlequin Romances or something.

1149
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:32,091
If he was really good, he'd be fine,
so he's really just mediocre.

1150
01:02:36,045 --> 01:02:38,880
- I remember I...
- Yes?

1151
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:41,174
I either drove
out that night or I left.

Oh, yeah, were you
there that evening?

1153
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:48,682
- This is very funny. You waking up.
- This is almost like waking up stuff.

1154
01:02:48,683 --> 01:02:52,185
- We're constantly just falling asleep.
- Very funny.

1155
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:55,855
We had to have been really hammered
that night before. We drank a lot.

1156
01:02:55,856 --> 01:02:59,243
Almost drank ourselves
into sobriety, I suppose.

1157
01:03:00,695 --> 01:03:03,029
The light. Look at the light
creeping through.

1158
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,614
And that was natural.

1159
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:06,408
- I think it was.
- Yeah, I remember.

1160
01:03:06,409 --> 01:03:09,920
A lot of the stuff in there
we did fairly natural.

1161
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:14,341
- Look at that. Look at that shot there.
- No, I know.

1162
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:17,970
Mm-hm.

- Was I? Can you hear that?

1164

Whoops. Oh, God.

Look out.

1166
01:03:36,022 --> 01:03:37,990
Oh, here it comes.

1167
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:41,943
Now, is the bottle of wine
meant to indicate...?

1168
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:43,903
That I've been drinking
on my own in there?

1169
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:47,073
No, that after you got
back, you continued...?

1170
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:49,784
The bottle of wine is sitting
there the whole time.

1171
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:52,412
I mean, there's always an open
bottle of wine in the room.

1172
01:03:52,413 --> 01:03:57,468
Yeah, I mean, presumably these guys
are pretty much just drinking all the time.

you walk out, when you look.

again, I think, aren't we?

"Jack attempts
to concoct the big lie."

Yeah, and Sandra's... After she gets
past the Maya part of the conversation...

01:05:54,452 --> 01:05:57,888
she's got nothing. Look
at her, look at her.

No connection whatsoever.

1210
01:06:04,086 --> 01:06:07,255
She got awfully handy
with that motorcycle.

1211
01:06:07,256 --> 01:06:10,317
She had no idea
how to drive one, right?

1212
01:06:10,342 --> 01:06:14,804
Sandra practiced a tremendous amount,
then she and I practiced quite a bit...

01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:36,915
- Camera flares.
- Camera flares. Good music. Good times.

1465
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:40,252
Excellent times, Paul. Good
memories, great times.

1466
01:20:40,253 --> 01:20:44,631
Those are the ones, those are the golden
days. The salad days, Tom.

1467
01:20:44,632 --> 01:20:46,517
The salad days.

1468
01:20:48,386 --> 01:20:50,396
Oh, now we land.

1469
01:20:51,097 --> 01:20:54,099
Fire... That's actually Firestone.
I actually...

1470
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,642
- Oh, it is?
- Yes, it is.

1471
01:20:55,643 --> 01:20:59,656
I actually modeled my beard
on this gentleman's beard.

1472
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:03,734
When I met him, I thought, "I
should have the same beard he has."

1473
01:21:03,735 --> 01:21:06,362
"He's my hero." Whoever he is.
Leslie Brough...

1474
01:21:06,363 --> 01:21:10,500
- is the name of the character.
- And the great Peter Dennis.

1475
01:21:10,742 --> 01:21:13,494
Yes, sir. The great Peter...
The voice of Vinnie...

1476
01:21:13,495 --> 01:21:15,746
- Winnie the Pooh.
- Vinnie.

1477
01:21:15,747 --> 01:21:19,175
The Italian Winnie
the Pooh, Vinnie the Pooh.

1478
01:21:20,794 --> 01:21:22,762
Vincenzo the Pooh.

1479
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:27,174
Yeah, he's the official
voice of Winnie the Pooh.

1480
01:21:27,175 --> 01:21:29,936
- Nice man.
- Very. Englishman.

1481
01:21:30,845 --> 01:21:33,531
A Brit. A man of the gentry.

1482
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:35,775
- A man...
- British style.

1483
01:21:37,602 --> 01:21:40,238
Now, this was also at Firestone.

1484
01:21:40,939 --> 01:21:43,148
Or was this at Fess Parker?

1485
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:45,317
- I don't remember.
- Where was this?

1486
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:47,569
- It was an amazing place.
- I love this moment.

1487
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:51,824
Somebody, by accident, tapped
one of those casks or something...

1488
01:21:51,825 --> 01:21:54,535
- and we got in trouble.
- That was Virginia Madsen.

1489
01:21:54,536 --> 01:21:57,538
Yes, la Madsen. She
opened a cask.

1490
01:21:57,539 --> 01:22:01,843
- She was given a vinologist's demerit.
- Nicely done, sir.

1491
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:06,922
Never to be a sommelier.

1492
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:10,676
Here goes the sunset. He said, "At
that point the sun goes down..."

1493
01:22:10,677 --> 01:22:13,646
- "...and the movie becomes dark."
- Dark.

1494
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:16,482
- Oh, boy.
- Smoking grass.

1495
01:22:17,183 --> 01:22:21,446
- Smoking tea in front of her daughter.
- Gage, Mary Jane.

1496
01:22:22,689 --> 01:22:27,025
- Uncle Jack.
- Then lets a relatively strange man...

1497
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:31,038
- Yep. Relatively?
- Put his meat hooks on her daughter.

1498
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:36,410
- Continues smoking pot.
- She goes right back to smoking weed.

1499
01:22:36,411 --> 01:22:40,348
- Right back to the weed.
- Not even a moment's hesitation.

1500
01:22:40,373 --> 01:22:43,167
- Back to the smoke.
- Oh, no, but romance.

1501
01:22:43,168 --> 01:22:46,429
Wait a second. Hang on.

1502
01:22:46,588 --> 01:22:50,299
The flared dragon's nostrils
of car lights.

1503
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:52,718
- He's...
- Well...

1504
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:55,137
- And as we pull focus to me, I...
- Rack focus.

1505
01:22:55,138 --> 01:22:59,933
He's semi-tumescent.
He's got a Hollywood love.

1506
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:01,694
Look at that.

1507
01:23:02,729 --> 01:23:05,907
Semihard. Here we go
up the stairs.

1508
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:09,568
The Hugh Hefnerian gleaming.

1509
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:13,113
Yeah, really,
a very saucy gleam.

1510
01:23:13,114 --> 01:23:18,720
- And here we go with a...
- Here, Maya takes matters into...

1511
01:23:18,745 --> 01:23:21,881
- Ah, yes.
- Look at her.

1512
01:23:22,749 --> 01:23:25,009
- Diving right in.
- Glark.

1513
01:23:25,418 --> 01:23:27,336
- Glark?
- Glark.

1514
01:23:27,337 --> 01:23:29,514
- Glark.
- Glark.

1515
01:23:30,882 --> 01:23:33,759
- Here we go. Big score for...
- Very nice.

1516
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,637
- This is a nice little transition.
- A beautiful time lapse.

1517
01:23:36,638 --> 01:23:39,598
Indeed. Now, how did they do...?
This took some doing.

1518
01:23:39,599 --> 01:23:45,399
This is, I think, a massive...
What they call a frame dissolve.

1519
01:23:45,939 --> 01:23:49,316
- Yeah. From the dark to the light.
- From one shot to the other.

1520
01:23:49,317 --> 01:23:53,612
Yes, from one shot to the other. It
took a long time to get that shot...

1521
01:23:53,613 --> 01:23:56,532
because of something
about the panning-over thing. Yeah.

1522
01:23:56,533 --> 01:23:58,909
They might have locked it off.

1523
01:23:58,910 --> 01:24:01,203
We shot that, actually,
many, many times.

1524
01:24:01,204 --> 01:24:06,667
Which is all the better for me as I got
to taste la Madsen's lips over and over.

1525
01:24:06,668 --> 01:24:10,221
We have elliptically moved
past the knee-knocking.

1526
01:24:11,047 --> 01:24:12,714
- Indeed.
- The boot-knocking.

1527
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:16,426
And Alexander said he'd never want
to show lovemaking on camera.

1528
01:24:16,427 --> 01:24:18,637
Unless it was awkward
and unpleasant.

1529
01:24:18,638 --> 01:24:21,306
- Awkward.
- Ah, there he is.

1530
01:24:21,307 --> 01:24:24,151
- Look at him.
- Every lady's dream.

1531
01:24:25,812 --> 01:24:29,481
A nude pirate in her bed.

1532
01:24:29,482 --> 01:24:32,734
- A nude pirate.
- This is a lovely little montage.

1533
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:35,445
This is in Lompoc. We
went to an actual...

1534
01:24:35,446 --> 01:24:40,117
I mean, this is all essentially
a documentary sequence here...

1535
01:24:40,118 --> 01:24:43,078
- because we just went and filmed it.
- Little girls singing.

1536
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:47,958
- These are probably holiday tunes, right?
- I don't remember what was going on.

1537
01:24:47,959 --> 01:24:50,961
- It was Halloween.
- Oh, it was Halloween.

1538
01:24:50,962 --> 01:24:53,630
- Yeah, it was Halloween.
- They were singing...

1539
01:24:53,631 --> 01:24:56,633
- The old traditional...
- A warlock's chant.

1540
01:24:56,634 --> 01:25:00,229
Halloween ballads. Yeah.

1541
01:25:00,805 --> 01:25:05,767
- A coven.
- The autumn solstice chant...

1542
01:25:05,768 --> 01:25:09,247
for winter fertility.

1543
01:25:09,272 --> 01:25:12,125
No, what would it be?
The equinox.

1544
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:15,328
Is that right? The
autumn equinox, correct.

1545
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:19,031
- Again with a pen.
- Oh, with the pen.

1546
01:25:19,032 --> 01:25:22,335
This was a walnut grove.

1547
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:26,872
Right outside of Lompoc. Right
as you were driving into Lompoc.

1548
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:30,885
Charlie Manson resides
in Lompoc these days.

1549
01:25:31,252 --> 01:25:34,379
- He does.
- Yeah, he's in the maximum security...

1550
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:37,058
- Federal penitentiary.
- Thank you.

1551
01:25:38,885 --> 01:25:41,771
I love that you,
like, drop the bag.

1552
01:25:42,722 --> 01:25:46,108
- Figuratively and literally drop...
- Yeah.

1553
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:48,694
The bag full of fruit.

1554
01:25:49,604 --> 01:25:51,864
And breakfast materials.

1555
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:55,275
MAYA: How he adores Siena.

1556
01:25:55,276 --> 01:25:57,736
How he wants to get
a place with them...

1557
01:25:57,737 --> 01:25:59,780
and commute when he has to.

1558
01:25:59,781 --> 01:26:02,407
MILES: I'm sure he believed
every word of it.

1559
01:26:02,408 --> 01:26:06,054
COMMENTARY: A screed. Taking
me down a peg or two.

1560
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:07,630
A screed.

1561
01:26:12,126 --> 01:26:13,418
- Wow.
- Ooh.

1562
01:26:13,419 --> 01:26:16,797
- Wait a second. Now, hang on.
- No, I didn't.

1563
01:26:16,798 --> 01:26:19,141
- Oh, wait, I did.
- I know.

1564
01:26:20,009 --> 01:26:22,436
Well, yes. First, yes.

1565
01:26:24,555 --> 01:26:27,441
- Yes, of course, first.
- Well...

1566
01:26:27,767 --> 01:26:30,143
- How could I tell you...
- First things first.

1567
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:32,104
And then expect to make love?

1568
01:26:32,105 --> 01:26:36,525
How could I tell you Jack was getting
married and then expect to make love?

1569
01:26:36,526 --> 01:26:39,120
- Come on.
- Yeah. Here we go now.

1570
01:26:39,987 --> 01:26:42,781
I would've been logically
in retrograde at that point.

1571
01:26:42,782 --> 01:26:47,211
I would've been screwing myself
out of a fair night's tumble.

1572
01:26:55,336 --> 01:26:57,138
Tender moment.

1573
01:26:57,422 --> 01:26:59,306
A knee-knocking.

1574
01:27:01,426 --> 01:27:03,635
- That's for sure.
- Very emphatic.

1575
01:27:03,636 --> 01:27:05,563
That's for sure.

1576
01:27:10,476 --> 01:27:13,478
Oh. A little betrayal
of Jack, in a sense.

1577
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:15,990
Letting go of him right there.

1578
01:27:18,151 --> 01:27:19,660
See you.

1579
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:24,081
Goodbye, fair Maya.

1580
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:27,552
(COMMENTATORS CHUCKLING)

1581
01:27:27,577 --> 01:27:30,296
There she goes.
Well, that's that.

1582
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:34,925
What if Miles just
pathetically pursued her?

1583
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:38,879
Sure goes through his head.
Here we go.

1584
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,514
Here I am.

1585
01:27:42,425 --> 01:27:44,477
Again. Ebonics.

1586
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:47,929
- "Your daddy."
- You're like a large sheepdog...

1587
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,347
in this scene.

1588
01:27:49,348 --> 01:27:52,651
The rubbing the cheeks is...
There we go.

1589
01:27:53,352 --> 01:27:57,323
You're like a huge... Like
a Saint Bernard in this scene.

1590
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:02,277
Awfully close for comfort.
There we go.

1591
01:28:02,278 --> 01:28:05,081
Look at the shorts I got on.
Jesus.

1592
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:10,970
This was the last day,
the very last thing we shot.

1593
01:28:10,995 --> 01:28:13,422
- The very last day.
- Correct.

1594
01:28:14,332 --> 01:28:18,752
MILES: Just make up whatever you want,
and that's what happened, okay?

1595
01:28:18,753 --> 01:28:22,348
Write out my gay confession,
and I'll sign it, okay?

COMMENTARY: Oh, a little improvisation
from our man Giamatti.

1597
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:30,856
That's award-winning stuff.

1598
01:28:32,725 --> 01:28:37,395
Look at you, incredulous, again,
that somebody would take offense at:

1599
01:28:37,396 --> 01:28:39,365
"You're a homo."

1600
01:28:40,274 --> 01:28:44,003
It's the statement of fact
that I love about that.

1601
01:28:44,028 --> 01:28:47,280
Look, I'm convinced
I've nailed the problem.

1602
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:50,659
- The problem is erectile dysfunction.
- E.D.

1603
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:54,547
It's gotta be. How could you
ever turn away from Maya?

1604
01:28:54,914 --> 01:28:57,624
JACK: Yeah. Uh-huh.

1605
01:28:57,625 --> 01:28:59,709
(WHISPERS)
It's Christine.

1606
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:03,347
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Yeah.
Yeah. Uh-huh.

1607
01:29:03,589 --> 01:29:05,549
Let me call you right back.

1608
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:09,145
Miles and I are kind
of in the middle of something.

COMMENTARY: Diving into a fetal pose.
- Again.

1610

- Here we go. Always.
- Again, I put your head on a pike.

1611
01:29:16,936 --> 01:29:19,104
- This is good stuff.
- What did Alexander say?

1612
01:29:19,105 --> 01:29:24,150
They would only give him a piece
of The Grind from 1996.

1613
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:25,777
This was...

1614
01:29:25,778 --> 01:29:29,072
After it outlived
it's syndication value...

1615
01:29:29,073 --> 01:29:30,949
they gave us a clip.

1616
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:34,369
There's a missing sequence here
that I miss, where we go...

1617
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:37,372
- and buy me a pair of sneakers.
- You model.

1618
01:29:37,373 --> 01:29:40,917
There's nothing particularly...
But it was funny.

1619
01:29:40,918 --> 01:29:43,795
- What was the sport?
- I can't remember the name of it.

1620
01:29:43,796 --> 01:29:46,172
- I can't either.
- I can't remember the name.

1621
01:29:46,173 --> 01:29:50,093
- The guy, Sporty-something.
- Sporty, the guy selling me the shoes...

1622
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:53,722
was very funny. So here's the big
industrial wine place.

1623
01:29:53,723 --> 01:29:55,098
Yeah, look at him.

1624
01:29:55,099 --> 01:29:57,767
- Windham Hill-ish.

01:29:57,768 --> 01:30:00,645
- Plucking his guitar.
- Windham Hill-ish.

1626
01:30:00,646 --> 01:30:03,523
- Good details in this place.
- This was at Fess Parker's.

1627
01:30:03,524 --> 01:30:06,610
This was, but they changed
what it looked like inside.

1628
01:30:06,611 --> 01:30:09,321
We should give a little background
on Frass Canyon.

1629
01:30:09,322 --> 01:30:14,659
Sure, take it away. Frass Canyon.
"Frass"...

1630
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:19,140
being just another vocabulary
word on the commentary here.

1631
01:30:19,165 --> 01:30:23,960
"Frass" was a word that Alexander
picked up from his exterminator...

1632
01:30:23,961 --> 01:30:27,923
who came to the home
that he was living in, in Los Olivos.

1633
01:30:27,924 --> 01:30:29,674
- Santa Ynez.
- Santa Ynez.

1634
01:30:29,675 --> 01:30:34,730
And he informed
Alexander that...

1635
01:30:35,932 --> 01:30:39,818
general insect feces
is known as frass.

1636
01:30:40,186 --> 01:30:43,355
- So and hence, Frass Canyon.
- Bug excrement.

1637
01:30:43,356 --> 01:30:45,282
Bug-doody canyon.

1638
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:48,401
- Caterpillar doo-doo.
- Nicely done.

1639
01:30:48,402 --> 01:30:52,697
Frass. But they didn't want it
to be Caterpillar Doo-doo Canyon.

01:30:52,698 --> 01:30:55,951
Tipping your hand a little with that.
Tipping the hand.

- Voice of one of my agents.
- Is that right'?

1644
01:31:09,382 --> 01:31:13,635
Toni Howard of the great International
Creative Management agency.

1645
01:31:13,636 --> 01:31:16,855
Nicely done. Now,
that's a product placement.

01:31:19,183 --> 01:31:21,267
Walking away from camera...

01:31:21,268 --> 01:31:26,991
his hopes and dreams about to be
dashed on the rocky shoals of...

1648
01:31:28,401 --> 01:31:30,035
reality.

01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:33,205
- Oh.
- Oh.

1650
01:31:34,281 --> 01:31:38,243
But it's great the way he lets things
play out in big old shots like that.

1651
01:31:38,244 --> 01:31:40,787
Rejected by the 17th publisher.

1652
01:31:40,788 --> 01:31:44,383
Yeah, rejected by Conundrum.

1653
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:46,835
A tiny little publishing
company.

1654
01:31:46,836 --> 01:31:49,972
Really confused
as to what they wanna publish.

1655
01:31:50,214 --> 01:31:53,142
- And certainly not...
- Hence, Conundrum.

1656
01:31:54,427 --> 01:31:57,771
Not even sure if they wanna
publish books.

Oh, here you go. There you see
me take some pills. There we go.

1660
01:32:08,315 --> 01:32:11,151
- Popping.
- Here we go. Marching in purposefully.

Popping. Popping fresh Valium.

01:32:14,989 --> 01:32:18,825
We only had four shirts, I think.
So we only had four goes at this.

1663
01:32:18,826 --> 01:32:20,577
- This guy was wonderful.
- Joe Marinelli.

1664
01:32:20,578 --> 01:32:26,378
- Wonderful. See how he daintily...
- Yeah. He makes sure that he...

1665

- A dainty dollop.
- Yep.

Yeah, even more, you're right.

1672
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,799
We have a little bit of a fight.

1673
01:32:58,824 --> 01:33:01,743
- A little violence in the movie.
- And you narrowly...

1674
01:33:01,744 --> 01:33:06,715
- missed giving him some chin music.
- Did I really, with the bottle? Jesus.

01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:15,173
- Oh, no.
- Wow.

1677
01:33:15,174 --> 01:33:17,967
That was, in fact,
wine and spit.

1678
01:33:17,968 --> 01:33:22,356
It was indeed. Everybody... Every
extra got to spit in the bucket.

1679
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:26,994
And, uh... And I... Yeah.

1680
01:33:27,019 --> 01:33:31,657
I know, that was that horrible fake
wine, which we drank a lot of.

01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:34,567
- I love that shot.
- It's a beautiful shot.

1682

And the marine layer
rolling in...

- The marine layer.
- As we were shooting.

It is a beautiful shot.
Again, a beautiful shot.

Now, that was at a state park
that I believe was south of Santa Barbara.

1686
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:51,876
- No.
- South of Santa Ynez.

1687
01:33:51,877 --> 01:33:55,356
That's right, between Buellton
and Santa Barbara.

1688
01:33:55,381 --> 01:33:59,008
- Just north of Santa Barbara.
- Really amazing, those trestles.

1689
01:33:59,009 --> 01:34:02,220
We got a couple of shots of trains
going over. A couple of takes...

1690
01:34:02,221 --> 01:34:06,191
I think a train went over, didn't it?
But freezing.

1691
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:09,394
- Freezing.
- Wasn't it just unbelievably cold?

1692
01:34:09,395 --> 01:34:14,616
- Miserable, cold.
- My hands were mitts of ice.

that was all your ad-libbing.

- Yes. Yes, indeed, it was.

- No.

- Explain. Take it away.

A 300-frame dissolve.

1739

- Now, that's really long, right?
- Quite long.

1740
01:36:59,023 --> 01:37:02,868
Quite long. Twenty-four frames
per second, do the math.

1741
01:37:04,570 --> 01:37:09,291
Do the math. Many seconds
of frame dissolve.

Oh, dear. Good stuff.

look at the woman.

- I just look at the woman.
- Like she's responsible.

01:39:48,525 --> 01:39:53,362
the vibrant living character.
I love you...

01:39:53,363 --> 01:39:56,240

- I just swivel around.

Get such satisfaction
looking at my food.

1788
01:40:00,579 --> 01:40:05,217

- Just disgusted by the proceedings.

1789
01:40:05,709 --> 01:40:08,628

- Look at you. Look at you.

1790
01:40:08,629 --> 01:40:11,223
Yeah, just wanna be left alone.

if he's a real guy.

That's what I love, "Did
you ever know...'?"

Wait, wait. Wait a minute.
Longer hair.

1795
01:40:29,942 --> 01:40:33,778
As a doctor, I love that.
He has longer hair.

1796
01:40:33,779 --> 01:40:37,749
Something about that thing
makes you look so much more...

1797
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:43,746
wolf-like or something. It really
emphasizes something about your eyes.

1798
01:40:43,747 --> 01:40:47,291
CAMMI: Yeah, it's right
over there, past the buffalo.

Yes, much more so.

1801
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:54,766
- Yeah, Jesus.
- And also the shirt, I think.

1802
01:40:54,925 --> 01:40:58,302
- Yeah, yeah, you're right.
- Look at that.

1803
01:40:58,303 --> 01:41:01,472
This place was a trip. They
didn't do anything to that place.

1804
01:41:01,473 --> 01:41:05,610
- Men. Men. Look at the hooves.
- This place was just as is.

1805
01:41:06,186 --> 01:41:09,480
I think they moved
that buffalo, didn't they?

1806
01:41:09,481 --> 01:41:12,316
No, everything's exactly
where it was supposed to be.

1807
01:41:12,317 --> 01:41:15,861
- I remember there was a big bear.
- Yeah, it was a polar bear.

1808
01:41:15,862 --> 01:41:19,574
- Somewhere in there.
- It was like the fifth largest bear...

1809
01:41:19,575 --> 01:41:23,753
- ever riddled with bullets.
- Right, right. The fifth one.

1810
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:27,632
You're right. Filled
with grapeshot.

1811
01:41:28,917 --> 01:41:31,460
The fifth largest bear ass
to receive grapeshot.

1812
01:41:31,461 --> 01:41:34,505
It took a 40 mm howitzer
to bag this one.

1813
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:37,341
- But we got him.
- And here he is.

1814
01:41:37,342 --> 01:41:40,011
At A.J. Spurs. Who
would have thought?

1815
01:41:40,012 --> 01:41:43,148
He was hibernating
when we took him.

1816
01:41:45,475 --> 01:41:47,476
Alexander always told
me he loved this scene.

1817
01:41:47,477 --> 01:41:50,614
It's funny, it's good.
But you're very...

1818
01:41:50,897 --> 01:41:55,359
You have the cold eyes
of a killer in this scene.

1819
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,653
And you're almost
tearfully beseeching me.

1820
01:41:57,654 --> 01:42:02,292
Well, yeah, at this point the insanity,
it's gotten way too black.

1821
01:42:02,868 --> 01:42:05,170
The whirlpool of madness.

1822
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:09,174
But you definitely have a cold-eyed...
The eyes of...

1823
01:42:09,625 --> 01:42:11,718
The eyes of a killer.

1824
01:42:12,544 --> 01:42:14,846
The icy eyes of a madman.

1825
01:42:17,049 --> 01:42:21,686
- The one final head shake.
- Oh, no, sir.

1826

They don't understand.

1827
01:42:24,681 --> 01:42:29,727
Now, I draw your attention to something
that you chose to do here...

1828
01:42:29,728 --> 01:42:35,367
that I was thinking the other day was key
to selling a lot of the humor of this.

1829
01:42:35,692 --> 01:42:39,496
You didn't have to be naked.
You were genuinely naked.

1830
01:42:41,073 --> 01:42:43,324
Well, in the script,
I had my underwear on.

1831
01:42:43,325 --> 01:42:47,328
And I remember a lengthy debate about,
"wouldn't I have left my underwear?"

1832
01:42:47,329 --> 01:42:50,331
But it's just great
that you're completely naked.

1833
01:42:50,332 --> 01:42:53,751
It's much better
than if you'd been wearing your underwear.

No, she had to order them special.

The first time I saw that scene, he...
It was considerably longer.

you don't force the audience...

- Look at that.

01:48:58,074 --> 01:49:03,078
- Here we go. Now MC was playing this...
- Pretty nimble on the pursuit.

1945
01:49:03,079 --> 01:49:06,290
- Unbelievably nimble for a big man.
- Here it comes.

1946
01:49:06,291 --> 01:49:08,634
For a big man, barefooted.

1947
01:49:09,627 --> 01:49:12,254
- He got real close to me.
- Look at him.

1948
01:49:12,255 --> 01:49:14,432
Shit. Now, of course...

Now, he... Wow, there's a lot of...
Boy. Boy.

- Yeah.

01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:26,268
- Correct?
- Was it the first take?

1952
01:49:26,269 --> 01:49:27,936
- No, second take.
- Or second take?

1953
01:49:27,937 --> 01:49:33,737
He shattered the window
with his prodigious junk.

1954
01:49:35,779 --> 01:49:39,415

- Softly, here he is, like a baby.

Lots of windmills.

the burgundy-red shirt for the first time...

It was the, you know...

Some Indian chief was hung,

horrible happened around it.

fact about how this was done...

You know what? You can
actually sort of tell.

- See how he jiggled?
- Yeah. There's a guy dressed as a chair.

1990
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:58,095
A guy dressed as a car seat...

1991
01:51:58,213 --> 01:52:02,049
- actually steering the vehicle.
- Yeah. With an actual...

1992
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:06,803
incredibly detailed, painfully
detailed and accurate facsimile...

1993
01:52:06,804 --> 01:52:09,139
of a car seat
that he was wearing.

1994
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:14,645
Which gave Tom and I no end
of mirth at this guy's expense.

1995
01:52:14,646 --> 01:52:18,574
- Gleeful howling.
- Yeah. Boy, he didn't appreciate that.

1996

- His name was Tom.
- That's right.

- Yes, indeed. He was...

1998

And he did outstanding work.

There we go.

Masculine affection.

01:52:44,509 --> 01:52:48,053
- That's the best we could muster.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

01:52:48,054 --> 01:52:51,899
It's kind of all over for these two.
It's sad, actually.

01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:56,663
Yeah. "Nicely done."
Like that moment.

01:52:56,688 --> 01:52:58,230
- No, yeah, no.
- "Nicely done."

01:52:58,231 --> 01:53:01,450
You say it like you're
saying goodbye to me.

01:53:01,776 --> 01:53:04,778
Oh, kind of over for these two guys.
People say to me:

"What's gonna happen? What's gonna
happen to the two guys?"

2010
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:08,991
I have no idea.

2011
01:53:08,992 --> 01:53:11,535
I don't think they're gonna
be hanging out too much.

2012
01:53:11,536 --> 01:53:15,298
I like the slow push-in.

There she is.

2014
01:53:21,337 --> 01:53:24,673
You know what I love about this?
I like when Alexander pushes it.

2015
01:53:24,674 --> 01:53:27,092
And it's just dialing
in the sadness...

2016
01:53:27,093 --> 01:53:30,595
- and kind of the detachment.
- Yeah, I guess it's sort of...

2017
01:53:30,596 --> 01:53:34,349
- From a family. I mean, Jack is...
- You're surrounded by a family now.

2018
01:53:34,350 --> 01:53:38,020
As much as it's not a good idea
for you to marry into that family.

No kidding.

was a real Armenian church...

- That's right outside of San Diego.

2102
01:58:41,365 --> 01:58:43,000
Love this.

2103
01:58:43,534 --> 01:58:45,619
- Yeah, like, I mean...
- Hearkens back.

2104
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:49,289
- Indeed, indeed, sir.
- A small gathering in a closet.

2105
01:58:49,290 --> 01:58:51,666
Nicely done, I hadn't
even thought of that.

2106
01:58:51,667 --> 01:58:54,461
I guess people think
I'm going to get a...

2107
01:58:54,462 --> 01:58:57,640
- Yeah.
- You know, a Luger out of there.

2108
01:58:58,549 --> 01:59:00,383
- And do myself in.
- A Walther.

2109
01:59:00,384 --> 01:59:03,020
- A Walther. A PPK.
- A Walther PK.

2110
01:59:04,180 --> 01:59:08,391
- This place was great.
- Now, that was also in Santa Maria.

2111
01:59:08,392 --> 01:59:10,977
Was it? I don't remember.
Look at how blue...

2112
01:59:10,978 --> 01:59:13,188
- But I love this.
- Look at the blue windows.

2113
01:59:13,189 --> 01:59:14,865
I love this.

2114
01:59:15,566 --> 01:59:17,400
Pretension has been abandoned.

2115
01:59:17,401 --> 01:59:23,201
Pretension, all of the self-delusion
has been dropped, and he's...

2116
01:59:23,407 --> 01:59:29,207
- The urinophilic ramparts have been...
- Stormed.

2117
01:59:29,372 --> 01:59:32,666
- Have been...
- Have fallen. They've been laid siege to.

2118
01:59:32,667 --> 01:59:35,844
- Are forsooth.
- Nicely done, sir.

2119
01:59:35,961 --> 01:59:38,430
And there we go.

2120
01:59:39,090 --> 01:59:43,259
I look like I should be in Fiddler
on the Roof, though, a little bit, don't I?

2121
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:46,105
- The white shirt thing.
- I love that.

2122
01:59:47,765 --> 01:59:51,059
Yes, you are Topol-like.

2123
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:53,487
(COMMENTATORS LAUGHING)

2124
01:59:53,604 --> 01:59:58,525
Topol, oh, God. If
only, Tom, if only.

2125
01:59:58,526 --> 02:00:01,912
Here we are, and what we're
reading here is...

2126
02:00:02,029 --> 02:00:04,155
- We're reading A Separate Peace.
- Yeah.

2127
02:00:04,156 --> 02:00:07,909
Which Alexander claims
was a random choice.

2128
02:00:07,910 --> 02:00:10,662
- But I can't believe that it was.
- Yeah.

2129
02:00:10,663 --> 02:00:13,498
- Because it has such a...
- Oh, the passages.

2130
02:00:13,499 --> 02:00:15,166
Very specifically applicable.

2131
02:00:15,167 --> 02:00:17,460
And the story of A Separate
Peace is the two friends.

2132
02:00:17,461 --> 02:00:20,097
The one guy kills the other guy.

2133
02:00:20,339 --> 02:00:22,191
- Yeah.
- And...

2134
02:00:22,216 --> 02:00:24,467
But there's the introverted guy.

2135
02:00:24,468 --> 02:00:28,939
And there's the more extroverted guy.
And I mean, it all sort of...

2136
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:34,486
fits perfectly. But that might just
be my literal-minded take on things.

2137
02:00:40,359 --> 02:00:43,287
Sporting a nice tweed
sport coat there.

2138
02:00:43,988 --> 02:00:46,582
And a worn canvas book bag.

2139
02:00:49,410 --> 02:00:51,661
The interior of this
apartment was great.

2140
02:00:51,662 --> 02:00:53,163
Oh, yeah.

2141
02:00:53,164 --> 02:00:57,500
It actually always occurred to me that this
is pretty hip. It's like it's kind of...

2142
02:00:57,501 --> 02:01:00,837
A little bit. Yeah, it's actually
kind of a cool bohemian thing.

2143
02:01:00,838 --> 02:01:02,547
Yeah, I know what you mean.

2144
02:01:02,548 --> 02:01:05,633
- There's something kind of cool about it.
- I mean, the art.

2145
02:01:05,634 --> 02:01:09,480
No, you're right. You're right.
It's a good...

2146
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:12,649
What are they, like,
rattan shades?

2147
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:16,862
Got a nice use of rattan.

2148
02:01:19,231 --> 02:01:21,333
This was actually...

2149
02:01:21,358 --> 02:01:26,163
the very first thing we shot.

2150
02:01:29,366 --> 02:01:32,035
- I remember.
- The absolute end of the movie...

2151
02:01:32,036 --> 02:01:34,579
was the very first thing
we shot, which was...

2152
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:36,706
A little foreshadowing, perhaps.

2153
02:01:36,707 --> 02:01:42,507
No, the carved Oscar-like icon
in the left corner of the screen.

2154
02:01:44,548 --> 02:01:47,226
With breasts
on that one, though.

2155
02:01:48,803 --> 02:01:51,021
She's gripping herself.

2156
02:01:51,263 --> 02:01:54,641
- With delights. Holding her sides with...
- An Academy tradition.

2157
02:01:54,642 --> 02:01:56,193
Mirth.

2158
02:01:57,061 --> 02:01:59,687
- I love this stuff.
- It was nerve-racking.

2159
02:01:59,688 --> 02:02:01,856
I don't think I'd ever
had to do that.

2160
02:02:01,857 --> 02:02:06,277
Shooting the very end of something,
it was the very first thing we did.

2161
02:02:06,278 --> 02:02:09,998
And so I'm sitting
there thinking:

2162
02:02:11,033 --> 02:02:13,868
"Well, it can only go
up from here."

2163
02:02:13,869 --> 02:02:16,046
(COMMENTATORS LAUGHING)

2164
02:02:19,041 --> 02:02:21,218
And again the dissolve.

2165
02:02:21,836 --> 02:02:25,222
But not a 300-frame one.
That was a quicker one.

2166
02:02:27,258 --> 02:02:31,436
MAYA: Let me know. I would say
stop by the restaurant, but...

2167
02:02:32,263 --> 02:02:37,317
I'm not sure how much longer I'll be there.
Because I'm gonna graduate soon.

2168
02:02:39,812 --> 02:02:44,399
COMMENTARY: Sexy, husky-voiced Maya.
Beckoning.

2169
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:48,287
Yes, indeed, a siren
song drawing me in.

2170
02:02:48,487 --> 02:02:52,657
In we go. Well, I have very
cheerful orange shirt on.

2171
02:02:52,658 --> 02:02:56,253
I look like a flamenco dancer.

2172
02:02:57,454 --> 02:03:00,299
- Blousy.
- Blousy. Yep.

2173
02:03:01,375 --> 02:03:05,554
Like a buccaneer
leaping up and...

2174
02:03:06,130 --> 02:03:08,807
- Now...
- Capturing his lady fair.

2175
02:03:10,634 --> 02:03:13,094
- Alexander says that...
- Right there.

2176
02:03:13,095 --> 02:03:15,814
She doesn't live there anymore.

2177
02:03:16,307 --> 02:03:19,693
Alexander's take is,
the door opens and it's...

2178
02:03:19,977 --> 02:03:23,363
some 72-year-old woman
in a wheelchair. Yeah.

2179
02:03:25,316 --> 02:03:27,659
- Well.
- Well, Tom, it's...

2180
02:03:27,818 --> 02:03:30,996
- Paul, you...
- Once again, Tom, we...

2181
02:03:32,072 --> 02:03:36,117
- There's the cast.
- Joe Marinelli, Toni Howard.

2182
02:03:36,118 --> 02:03:38,995
- Rob Trow, "Obnoxious Golfer."
- Khoren Babouchian.

2183
02:03:38,996 --> 02:03:41,164
Rob Trow was the obnoxious...

2184
02:03:41,165 --> 02:03:43,833
Jaren Coler, the Windham
Hill-ish guitarist.

2185
02:03:43,834 --> 02:03:46,002
- Acoustic guitar. George Parra.
- Nice.

2186
02:03:46,003 --> 02:03:48,421
- Nick Satriano.
- And Ginger Sledge.

2187
02:03:48,422 --> 02:03:52,216
- Everybody doing Dondi Bastone.
- Yeah.

2188
02:03:52,217 --> 02:03:55,345
Glad we got Frank Gaeta
on sound design.

2189
02:03:55,346 --> 02:03:57,430
- Tracy Boyd.
- Our friend.

2190
02:03:57,431 --> 02:04:02,361
Yes, indeed, a fine man. Everybody,
every last, every man Jack of them.

2191
02:04:02,853 --> 02:04:06,064
- I'm Thomas Haden Church.
- And I'm Paul Giamatti.

2192
02:04:06,065 --> 02:04:08,524
- And thanks for watching.
- Thank you.

2193
02:04:08,525 --> 02:04:10,827
- Good night.
- Good night.
