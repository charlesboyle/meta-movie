1
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,445
Light your nuts on fire.

2
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,448
Fuck! Fuck! My hands!

3
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,541
Too hot for Jonah!

4
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,053
I got fucking water in my mouth!

5
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,704
Oh, my God!

6
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,365
I got to get off! I got
to get off! Got to get off!

7
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:26,465
Got to get off!

8
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,099
Sadie, wake up!

9
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,601
Oh, my gosh!

10
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,470
Daddy, wake up!

11
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,571
Okay, I'm up.

12
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,688
Is that my genius over here?
Is that my genius?

13
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,858
I need you to take the kids
to school this morning.

14
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,863
- I would, but I'm supposed to work out.
- What?

15
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,227
Yeah. I got an appointment
with a trainer. I can't cancel

16
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:15,268
it now. He'll charge me.

17
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,995
- You didn't tell me that.
- Yeah, I did.

18
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,968
- Last week I told you.
- You didn't tell me.

19
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,774
I did. And then I wrote it on the calendar

20
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:21,674
like you told me to.

21
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:22,934
No, you didn't tell me.

22
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,874
- I did tell you.
- Well, you didn't,

23
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,674
but what are we gonna do,
'cause I have an appointment?

24
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,647
So you're taking the kids to school.

25
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,777
Don't use the baby to cover your tracks.

26
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,117
I can drive them.
I'll drive them to school.

27
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,453
- Thank you very much.
- Great. Good.

28
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,390
You turned my sister into a limo driver.

29
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,892
- I don't mind.
- It all worked out!

30
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,525
What are you giggling about?

31
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,234
Be quiet.
You're starting to annoy me.

32
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,036
- Poo poo.
- Ladies. Be nice.

33
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,737
- You know what I did the other day?
- What?

34
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,680
- I googled 'murder.'
- You googled 'murder'?

35
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,081
- Yeah.
- Why?

36
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,516
I mean, what did it say?

37
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,679
It didn't say anything.
It just showed pictures

38
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:12,626
of people lying dead on the floor and blood

39
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,318
everywhere, and...

40
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,589
That was just ketchup.

41
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,164
- Who wants to hear some music?
- I want to hear Rent.

42
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,393
I want to hear Green Day!

43
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,059
No, we're listening to Rent!

44
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,797
Well, I want to listen to Green Day.

45
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,566
I got your baby!

46
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,073
- Don't taunt her. Come on.
- Here.

47
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,350
Sadie! Why did you just do that? Don't throw

48
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,512
things at your sister!

49
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,840
She hit me.

50
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,177
- Did you hit her?
- I did not.

51
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,080
Make her happy. It's okay.

52
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,015
- It won't make her happy.
- It's okay. It's okay.

53
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,519
She spilled all the marbles on the floor.

54
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:42,782
Well, give her her marble back.

55
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,139
All right? Are you sure you understand

56
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:45,925
the terms of the bet?

57
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,118
- Because this is serious.
- No.

58
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,389
Martin, all right, listen.

59
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,899
You don't shave your beard
or cut your hair for one year,

60
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,128
and if you can do that,
I will pay your rent.

61
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,530
But if you shave,
then you have to pay

62
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,973
all five of our rents.

63
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,301
Thanks for the free money, bitch.

64
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,637
Hey, Martin, was it weird
when you joined the Taliban,

65
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,438
being American and everything like that?

66
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,914
Like when you see a woman driving a car,

67
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:07,780
do you just get pissed?

68
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,202
Just watch your back, Serpico.
You never know

69
00:04:10,302 --> 00:04:11,384
who your friends are.

70
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,246
Okay, all right. You guys can't make fun of me

71
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:13,887
the whole time.

72
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,047
But, Martin, it's a competition.
It's called the Dirty Man Competition.

73
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,954
We're gonna make fun of you
until you shave the beard.

74
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,218
- That's the rules.
- That's the whole point.

75
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,817
You're supposed to be tempted into shaving.

76
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,623
Your face looks like Robin Williams' knuckles.

77
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,497
You guys aren't allowed to make fun of me.

78
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:27,500
It's not part of the rules.

79
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,344
Martin, why didn't you just listen to me when

80
00:04:29,444 --> 00:04:30,470
I was explaining the rules?

81
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,852
You just looked at me with that

82
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:32,805
blank stare of yours.

83
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,499
It was like talking to a wax statue.

84
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,943
Okay, guys, are you ready?

85
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,036
So, 'Only at fleshofthestars. com will

86
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:44,109
customers be able to find

87
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:47,131
'exactly how long into what movies their

88
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,280
favorite stars are exposed.'

89
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,754
- Nice.
- Oh, fucking brilliant.

90
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:51,915
Pretty good, right?

91
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,618
Yeah. Yeah, ka-ching.
We're in.

92
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,524
All right, guys,
let start logging, all right?

93
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,580
Charles Manson?
Do you have

94
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,363
any other thoughts?

95
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,819
Good, awesome,
let's start this off

96
00:04:58,919 --> 00:04:59,365
with a bang.

97
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,810
Jamie Lee Curtis. I got an hour and 10 minutes

98
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,902
into Trading Places.

99
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,833
Both chesticles.

100
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,534
I got Julianne 'Red Beard' Moore.

101
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,773
Short Cuts, two hours,
17 minutes, bush no boobs.

102
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,371
Julianne Moore special.
She loves it.

103
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,540
I've seen that,

104
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,853
and from the look of her bush,
Short Cuts is the wrong

105
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:20,753
name for that movie.

106
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,980
Nice.
Nice. Nice. Well done.

107
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,708
Her bush looks like the hedge maze

108
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:25,959
from The Shining but red

109
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,959
and without Scatman Crothers in it.

110
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,891
Red Bush.

111
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,696
Red Bush.

112
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,012
So if you want that perfect tan like the stars,

113
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:38,938
he's the one to see.

114
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,302
We'll be right back on E! News. Stay with us.

115
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,138
- Okay.
- Okay, is Jessica Simpson here yet?

116
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,235
Let me check. Let me see.

117
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,746
- Is she on her way? She's left her house?
- Hey, guys?

118
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,145
Okay, let me know when she's pulling in.

119
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,808
- She's about to pull in.
- Is she camera-ready?

120
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,010
Is she camera-ready?

121
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,296
If she's gonna be in hair
and makeup for three hours,

122
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:55,955
I can't do it.

123
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,023
I'm not gonna be here.
I got to do American Idol.

124
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,525
It's live. I got to do it.
I got to be there.

125
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:01,972
- What are we gonna interview her about?

126
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:02,629
Nothing personal.

127
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,424
- No personal questions.
- No personal questions.

128
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,088
Don't ask her about her sister
and her nose job.

129
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,530
- No plastic surgery questions.
- No plastic...

130
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,692
No personal questions.

131
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,265
She doesn't want to talk about
her boobs or her father's

132
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:12,472
comments about her boobs.

133
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,988
Great. We'll talk about
the Middle East and maybe

134
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:16,476
an idea of an exit strategy.

135
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,702
Maybe she has a good pitch.

136
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,301
Should I ask her about Korea?

137
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,210
Maybe have her point it out to us on a globe?

138
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,647
I don't understand
the young talent in this town!

139
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,481
It doesn't make any sense.
I got four jobs.

140
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,053
Hell, I'm more famous than half the people

141
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:29,789
we talk to, anyway!

142
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,947
No one stands up.

143
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,115
No one has the balls to sit them down

144
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,419
and say,
'Look, just cut the shit.'

145
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,619
But everybody works for them.

146
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,718
They're all on the payroll.
They're all sucking the teat!

147
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,470
Nobody sits them down,
eye-to-eye, one-on-one,

148
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,034
and says, 'Cut the shit.'

149
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,658
And all these stars just fuck it up.

150
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,794
That's what they do.
They fuck my day up!

151
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,462
And it pisses me off.
And now I'm sweating.

152
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,062
Okay, you want to...
You know what?

153
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,227
You want us to just come and get you

154
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:49,876
when she gets here?

155
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,466
You want to head to
the green room for a minute?

156
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,169
- Just chill out? - Okay.
- Yeah. - That's a good idea.

157
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,769
Want us to bring you anything?
You want some water?

158
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,678
- You want a cookie?
- Cookie, yeah, cookie. Thanks.

159
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,751
- Okay, we'll get you a cookie.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm pissed.

160
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,251
What do we got?
Chocolate chip?

161
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,445
- Allison?
- Yeah.

162
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,148
Jack and I need to see you in his office.

163
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,314
Okay.

164
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,025
Thanks for coming in, Allison.

165
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,958
Well, we wanted to talk to you today

166
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:13,540
because we had a little debate
on the conference call

167
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,234
with New York about you.

168
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,428
You... About me?
You were talking about me?

169
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,101
We were wondering aloud to one another

170
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,110
whether or not you would be good for on camera.

171
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,941
What'd you decide?

172
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,983
They... They decided that they like you,

173
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,453
and they would like to put you on camera.

174
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,490
- Really?
- I know. I was so surprised, too.

175
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,297
Oh, my God.
This is the best news ever.

176
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:41,194
Thank you so much.

177
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,819
- This is great!
- Congratulations.

178
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,478
- Thank you.
- I'll take that smile

179
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:46,632
as a 'Yes, I'll do it.'

180
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,996
Absolutely. I'm so excited!
Oh, my God.

181
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,468
It's a lot of work. Can't wait
to see what happens.

182
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,869
It's gonna be tough.
Tough job.

183
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,736
About the work,
most immediately,

184
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,211
there's gonna be some things that you're

185
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,077
gonna be able to get...

186
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,407
- Okay.
-...that other people in the office don't get.

187
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,378
One of them, gym membership.

188
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,676
You want me to lose weight?

189
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,380
No, I don't want you to lose weight.

190
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,852
No. We can't legally ask you to do that.

191
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:12,254
We didn't say lose weight.
I might say tighten.

192
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,484
Tight.

193
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,585
A little tighter?

194
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,596
Just like toned and smaller.

195
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,202
Don't make everything smaller.
I don't want to

196
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:22,402
generalize that way.

197
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,662
Tighter.

198
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,247
We don't want you to lose weight. We just

199
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:26,172
want you to be healthy.

200
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,366
- Okay.
- You know, by eating less.

201
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,050
We would just like it if you go home

202
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,503
and step on a scale

203
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,341
and write down how much you weigh

204
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:36,983
and subtract it by, like, 20.

205
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,916
- Twenty.
- And then weigh that much.

206
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,339
Just remember,
you've got it here,

207
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,682
you've got it here

208
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,884
and everybody's gonna see you right there.

209
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,292
Yay! That's so exciting!
Oh, my God!

210
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,488
Hey!

211
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,623
Huh?

212
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,098
I got a promotion.

213
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,759
- Oh, congratulations!
- Thank you.

214
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,268
Hey, maybe you can get your own place now.

215
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,134
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

216
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,729
- Yay!
- Let's go celebrate.

217
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,468
Okay. Let's do it.

218
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,271
- Pete'll watch the kids?
- Yeah!

219
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,209
We can watch Taxicab Confessions.

220
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,872
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know!

221
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,881
I'm so excited!

222
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,150
I walked in on him masturbating one night.

223
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,484
Did he get the deer-in-the-headlights look?

224
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,615
Did he freeze or did he finish?

225
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,755
No, he tried to pretend like he wasn't doing

226
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,625
anything under the covers.

227
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,794
Oh, no!

228
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,097
I buy these nice towels,
and he whacks off into them.

229
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,400
Deb and Pete, forever.
And...

230
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,012
And once he does that into them once,

231
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:38,162
they're never soft ever again.

232
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,222
I can always tell if I'm looking good based on

233
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:44,917
whether or not we get in.

234
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,985
Ladies?
Guess we're looking good.

235
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,560
If I didn't get in,
I would've lost my shit.

236
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,355
What's going on, man?

237
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,704
How long you gonna make us wait out here,

238
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:51,324
for Christ's sake?

239
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,516
What the fuck?

240
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,493
You know what movie I just
saw again the other day,

241
00:09:59,593 --> 00:10:00,500
which is fucking, like,

242
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,904
mind-blowing,
and I haven't seen it

243
00:10:02,004 --> 00:10:03,069
since it came out is Munich.

244
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,534
Oh, Munich!

245
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,105
Oh, man, Munich fucking rules.
Munich is awesome!

246
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,336
That movie was Eric Bana kicking fucking ass!

247
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,638
Dude, every movie with Jews,
we're the ones getting killed.

248
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,180
Munich flips it on its ear.
We're capping motherfuckers.

249
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,010
Not only killing but fucking,
like, taking names.

250
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,834
If any of us get laid tonight,
it's because

251
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:19,852
of Eric Bana in Munich.

252
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,010
- I agree with that.
- I agree.

253
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,678
You know what is not helping us get laid

254
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,350
is the shoe bomber,
Richard Reid,

255
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,558
over here at our table.

256
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,786
I don't like your shoes.
How is Burning Man this year?

257
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,193
Fuck you guys.
I'm glad I'm not Jewish.

258
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,390
- So are we.
- Yeah, so are we.

259
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,524
- Yeah.
- Fine, screw it.

260
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,965
- You weren't chosen for a reason.

261
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:38,365
Yeah.

262
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,141
It's like everyone in here is 12 years old.

263
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,075
- Am I too old to be here?
- What?

264
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,239
- Am I too old to be here?
- No, of course not.

265
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,839
Does it look weird that I'm here?

266
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,145
No, not at all.

267
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,948
Am I hotter than these little bitches?

268
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,989
Yes! You look amazing.

269
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,988
- Guys in here would fuck me, right?

270
00:10:59,088 --> 00:10:59,258
Yes.

271
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,054
That's weird to say,
but it makes me feel better.

272
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,526
You look hot.

273
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,120
Okay. I believe you.

274
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,062
- Okay. I'm getting us drinks.
- Okay.

275
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,929
Yo, a beer over here, please?

276
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,343
You're gonna be embarrassed when you realize

277
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:12,572
I'm Wilmer Valderrama.

278
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,764
God.

279
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,509
Hey, hey! Excuse me!

280
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,670
He's literally ignoring
this entire half of the bar.

281
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,737
Don't even bother.

282
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,839
Yeah, awesome.

283
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,044
A beer over here, please?

284
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,781
- He looked at us! Did you see that?
- Yeah, that was rough.

285
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,754
Oh, my God. And if you can't get service,

286
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:33,159
what am I gonna do, you know?

287
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,386
Great. It's gonna be that night.

288
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,895
- Okay, you want a beer?
- Yeah, just...

289
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,124
Well, I'm... Watch this.

290
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,893
Okay? Just observe.

291
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:44,895
- There you go.
- Come on, man.

292
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,404
Here you go. For your trouble.
Thank you. There you go.

293
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,770
- Thank you.
- Okay, enjoy it.

294
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,138
- Are you sure?
- I am sure.

295
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,160
I tried that once before at the Comedy Store,

296
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,479
and I got punched in the ear.

297
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,807
Thanks a lot.

298
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,146
Oh, fuck, fuck!
I'm supposed

299
00:11:56,246 --> 00:11:57,383
to get one for my sister.

300
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,475
- Oh, here, take mine.
- No, that's okay. I'll wait.

301
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,647
Please, I very rarely look cool. This is a big

302
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:05,591
moment for me. Just take it.

303
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,158
- Thank you. Awesome.
- No problem.

304
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,090
- I'm Allison.
- I'm Ben.

305
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,188
- Well, have a great night.
- Yeah, you, too.

306
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,097
- Thanks for the beer.
- Okay, enjoy, be nice to them.

307
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,433
- Bye. Thanks again.
- I'll see you. No, I'll see you later.

308
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,769
No, I won't 'cause I'm a pussy.

309
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,975
What's up, Ben?

310
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,882
That girl. She totally gave me an opening, man,

311
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:29,915
and I locked up.

312
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,349
I just want to get shit-faced tonight,

313
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:32,018
though, you know.

314
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,847
I'll just jerk it later.
It's cool.

315
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,946
Are you fucking crazy, man?
She looks smart.

316
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,389
- Who's that she's sitting with?
- It's her sister.

317
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,619
- Her sister?
- Yeah.

318
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,201
Dude, it's the dream.
What are we doing

319
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:44,030
standing here, man?

320
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,155
Let's go. Come on, follow me.
You stay here. Stay here.

321
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,894
- Why?
- Because your facelooks like a vagina.

322
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,627
Dick!

323
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,001
Hey, which one's the sister?

324
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,030
Hey, Crockett,
you still partying

325
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,620
with Tubbs these days?

326
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,707
Come on, man. I'm getting
it from all angles here.

327
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,804
- I don't like it anymore.
- I know. I don't, either.

328
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,217
Was it weird when you changed
your name from Cat Stevens

329
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:05,918
to Yusuf Islam?

330
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,315
Yeah, it was really awkward.

331
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,354
All right, man.
I got to take off.

332
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,218
See you, Scorsese-on-coke.

333
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,519
What's that?

334
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,186
Chewbacca.
You know, it's Chewie.

335
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,254
- Oh, another beard joke.
- Fuck.

336
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,889
Fucking hilarious!

337
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:23,927
- Hey.
- Hey.

338
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,266
Hi, this is my friend, Jason.

339
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,102
I just wanted to see how my beers were doing.

340
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,967
This is my sister, Debbie.

341
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,101
Oh, hi, I'm Ben.

342
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,611
- Hi. Ben?
- Yes.

343
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:34,872
Nice to meet you.

344
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,108
- How you doing?
- Good, how are you?

345
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,581
Just trying not to stare.

346
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:39,810
She's married.

347
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,250
Why do you have to say that?

348
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,184
- What?
- It's a shame.

349
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,415
You're beautiful.

350
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,479
Thank you.

351
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,286
She has two kids, too.

352
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,485
Shut up!

353
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,789
What? It's nothing to be ashamed of.

354
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,522
You think that's gonna
stop him from hitting on her?

355
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,155
It's not at all.

356
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,824
I love kids.

357
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,060
- Really?
- Yeah, absolutely.

358
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,094
Excuse me.

359
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,063
- Hello?
- Cool phone.

360
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,608
Yeah, she's got a really cool phone.

361
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,542
What? Is it a rash,
or is it the chicken pox?

362
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,210
I don't know! Google it.

363
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,772
Okay. All right, bye.

364
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,081
I got to go. Sadie might have the chicken pox.

365
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,104
I had the chicken pox three times.

366
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,624
I have no immunity to it.

367
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,715
We don't have the heart
to tell him it's herpes.

368
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,624
It's not herpes if it's everywhere.

369
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,286
Are you coming?

370
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,468
You know, I'm all dressed,
so I'll just hang out.

371
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,764
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll take a cab home.

372
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,634
Okay. Be safe.

373
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,075
I will. Yeah.

374
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,908
- Bye, lovely.
- Bye.

375
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,251
All right, I'm gonna let you
two get to know each other.

376
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:51,986
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

377
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,422
To you.

378
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,126
No, no. You know, the, like,
Entertainment News channel?

379
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,529
- E!
- E!

380
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,466
Dude, I think he's doing
the dice thing too much.

381
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,269
That's really all he's got.

382
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,778
I love your curly hair!
It's so great.

383
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,109
Do you, like,
use a product or anything?

384
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,547
No, that's...
I use Jew, it's called.

385
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,049
- You wanna get out of here?
- Yeah, let's go.

386
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,316
You wanna come back and hang out at my place?

387
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,688
Yes.

388
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,851
- Yeah. Wicked.
- I'll show you my audition tape.

389
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,395
- It's really funny.
- Okay, I'm really excited to watch that.

390
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,691
Let's go.

391
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,635
We could get a cab up,
this way. For sure.

392
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,461
This is a big yard.

393
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,440
Let's go swimming right now.
Let's just do that.

394
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,975
- I know. It feels so right.
- That's right.

395
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:56,988
Oh, man. Oh, man.
You're prettier than I am.

396
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,387
A lot.

397
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,864
- Do you have a condom?
- I do.

398
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,198
- Okay.
- In my pants. I have a condom.

399
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,033
Okay. Okay.
I'll get it.

400
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,742
Come on.

401
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,815
- Hurry up.
- Stupid fucker.

402
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,018
- What are you doing?
- I almost got it.

403
00:16:31,118 --> 00:16:32,091
Just give me a second.

404
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,455
Oh, God, just do it already!

405
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,859
- Okay.
- Oh, great. Okay.

406
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,101
God.

407
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,642
- Oh, that's great!
- Good thing I'm drunk.

408
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,771
- This is lasting forever.
- Yeah, it's awesome.

409
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,644
I just doubled my record time.

410
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,240
Oh, yeah. You did.

411
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,786
- I'm sorry, I'm sweating on you.
- Okay, just stop talking.

412
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,166
Fuck off, Martin.

413
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,366
I said, fuck off, Martin.

414
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,005
Hi.

415
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,648
Oh. Hey.

416
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,210
Hey.

417
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,045
I'm naked.

418
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,112
Yeah.

419
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,857
Did we have sex?

420
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:42,951
Yes.

421
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,056
Nice.

422
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,926
What time is it?

423
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,027
7:30.

424
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,402
Why the fuck are we awake?
Let's go back to sleep.

425
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,770
I have to go to work.

426
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,274
Really?

427
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,971
Do you need to get to work or anything?

428
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,037
No, I'm... No work today.

429
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,420
Do you wanna get breakfast?

430
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,581
Okay.

431
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,728
Morning.

432
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,430
Good morning, Allison.

433
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,530
I'm Ben.
What's happening, man?

434
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:29,965
Ben.

435
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,168
How's it going?

436
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,335
Ah, to be young.

437
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,435
Stop it.

438
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,880
You stop it.

439
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,013
Okay, see you later.

440
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,482
All righty.

441
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,076
See you later. Enjoy the day.

442
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,087
Never do what they did.

443
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,885
I'm gonna do it.

444
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:51,191
You are? Uh-oh. Someone's
getting home-schooled.

445
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,470
I just yacked something nasty.

446
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,570
I feel way better, though.
I think that's like

447
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,941
the secret. Like you gotta...

448
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,533
I mean, once you're hung-over,
you just gotta puke.

449
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,738
It feels so... Did you puke?

450
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,973
No.

451
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,639
You can. I won't think it's gross or anything.

452
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,580
Oh, that's okay, I'm fine.

453
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,118
- Okay.
- I just need some coffee, so...

454
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,652
You know, the best thing
for a hangover is weed.

455
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,722
- Do you smoke... Do you smoke weed?
- Not really.

456
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:18,915
- You don't?
- No.

457
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,390
- At all?
- Mmm-mmm.

458
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,484
Like in the morning?

459
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,728
No, I just don't.

460
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,959
You know, it's like...
It is like the best medicine.

461
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,761
Because it fixes everything.

462
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,393
Jonah broke his elbow once.

463
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,605
He just got high,
and it still clicks,

464
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:36,635
but, I mean, he's okay.

465
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,232
- Right.
- Yeah.

466
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,042
Last night was great,
what I remember of it.

467
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,513
Right, yeah.

468
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,277
Yeah, no, it was fun.
We had a great time.

469
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,749
Yeah.

470
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,251
So what do you do?

471
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,582
I work at E!

472
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,520
- The television channel?
- Uh-huh.

473
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:52,749
- Remember?
- Wow!

474
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,155
We had this conversation last night.

475
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,820
I told you about my promotion.
I was out celebrating it.

476
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,494
- No?
- No.

477
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,998
I don't remember that at all.

478
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,398
Yeah. I'm super excited about it.

479
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,834
I'm actually doing my first
on-air interview today, so...

480
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,633
- With who?
- Matthew Fox.

481
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,037
- Matthew Fox from Lost?
- Yeah.

482
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,307
- You know what's interesting about him?

483
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:10,509
What?

484
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,871
- Nothing.
- What?

485
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,549
- Will you tell him he's an asshole for me?

486
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:13,712
No.

487
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,803
Someone needs to.
Like who gives a shit?

488
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,164
Well, I hope a lot of people,
actually, because that's

489
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:19,051
what my job entails

490
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,312
is making sure people care what he has to say.

491
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,149
I'm interviewing him.

492
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,849
Maybe it's just me. Maybe
I just don't give a shit.

493
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,357
I'm just saying he deserves a beat-down.

494
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,744
Actually, it's sort of embarrassing

495
00:20:28,844 --> 00:20:29,595
to ask at this point,

496
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,720
but what do you do for work?

497
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,793
Me and my roommates have started a... We're

498
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:35,200
starting an Internet website.

499
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,892
Oh, cool. What is it?

500
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,698
I'll give you the virtual
experience, okay? How's that?

501
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,102
- You're at your computer.
- Mmm-hmm.

502
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,663
Who's an actress you like?

503
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,175
- Mary Tyler Moore?
- No.

504
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,404
- That does not work at all.
- No?

505
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,705
- No.
- Okay.

506
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:51,476
- Let's say you love Meg Ryan.
- I do.

507
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,881
- Great. Who doesn't?
- Yeah.

508
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,418
Let's say you like her so much

509
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,250
you wanna know every movie
where she shows her tits.

510
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,484
And not just that,
but how long into that

511
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:01,894
movie she shows her tits.

512
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,635
You come to our web page exclusively.

513
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:06,431
Type in 'Meg Ryan.' Bam!

514
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,281
In the Cut, 38 minutes in,
48 minutes in,

515
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:11,431
like an hour and 10 minutes...

516
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,063
She's, like, naked that whole fucking movie.

517
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,196
- She does full frontal in that movie.
- Wow.

518
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,504
- They should've called her Harry, not Sally.
- Really.

519
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,737
I'll show it to you.
I'll show you Meg Ryan's bush.

520
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:20,937
- Okay.
- Cool.

521
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,071
Yeah, I actually need to get going, so...

522
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,195
Well, could...
Can I get your number?

523
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:27,777
I mean, I don't...

524
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:31,287
We had fun, right?
We should hook up again.

525
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,441
I'm gonna give you my card 'cause that'll be

526
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,759
the best way to...

527
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,860
Well, I mean, if you want
to contact me, I don't have

528
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,965
a cell, right now,

529
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,625
because of payment complications.

530
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,032
But, I mean, you can e-mail me
at the web page. I check...

531
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,715
It's just Ben at flesh-of-the-stars,

532
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:49,096
one word, dot-com.

533
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,469
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

534
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,440
- Okay.
- So, awesome.

535
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,705
All right, then.
Nice to meet you.

536
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,712
- Yeah. Okay.
- Bye. Take care.

537
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,144
See you.

538
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,812
Bye!

539
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,617
That was fucking brutal.

540
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,755
Yeah, that was brutal.

541
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,387
It was a huge mistake.
What's a mistake?

542
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,924
Nothing. Nothing that we need
to talk about right now.

543
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,664
Why did you do it?

544
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:25,132
Aunty Allison drank too much chocolate milk.

545
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,993
And I was feeling weird because of that.

546
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:29,093
And I made a...

547
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,308
- I think that's enough.
- Okay.

548
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,580
- Did he wear a condom?
- Yes.

549
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:34,914
Thank God.

550
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,919
- Do you think you'll do it again?
- No, no way.

551
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,323
She was totally repulsed by me.

552
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,657
- What?
- She just really didn't seem to like me.

553
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,254
Like, she wasn't laughing at my jokes.
I mean, I'm like a funny guy.

554
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,300
- Fucking funny as balls.
- Hilarious, man.

555
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,459
I'm giving her the A shit.
Nothing. She thought our

556
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,537
web page was a bad idea.

557
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,628
- What?
- That fucking stuck-up bitch.

558
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,968
Yeah, I think so, too.

559
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,872
I think it's awesome that you had sex with her.

560
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,597
If a goofy guy like you
had sex with her, I feel like

561
00:23:00,697 --> 00:23:01,880
I had sex with her also.

562
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,948
I was so drunk.
I just wish I remembered it.

563
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,676
Hi, I'm Allison Scott.
And we're here today with

564
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:15,394
James Franco from Spider-Man.

565
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,654
- How are you?
- Great, great.

566
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,990
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

567
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,964
Tell me, were you a big fan of the...

568
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,159
- I'm sorry, let me take that again.
- Okay.

569
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,829
Tell me, were you a big fan
of the comic books growing up?

570
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,838
No, actually,

571
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,796
I didn't read any of the comic books until

572
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:32,736
I got the movie and then...

573
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,804
- Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

574
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,405
Yeah, just what about the comic books?

575
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,416
Just keep talking.

576
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,681
Like I said,
I really wasn't into them,

577
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,994
but now that I did
the research, I think they're

578
00:23:46,094 --> 00:23:47,654
pretty amazing, like...

579
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,421
Shit.

580
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,854
What the fuck?

581
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,830
Is that the sound of you puking?

582
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,947
If this is one of those fucking joke shows,

583
00:24:03,047 --> 00:24:03,775
I'm not into it.

584
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,843
- We should put this on YouTube.
- Shut up.

585
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,606
- This is hilarious.
- You're an asshole.

586
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,612
Look how sweaty you are.
You look like Dom DeLuise.

587
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,739
I don't need to see it again.
It's gonna make me throw up.

588
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,080
You look like Jabba the Hutt dying.

589
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,416
You're such an asshole.

590
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,958
I'm just jerking your chain.

591
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,357
I'll fix this. No problem.

592
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:26,090
Yeah, maybe if you can just
edit this out, and we can...

593
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,333
We can reshoot my questions.

594
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,367
What's up?

595
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,504
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Over here.

596
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,567
Not on the mix board,
not on the mix board, here.

597
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:44,913
Are you okay?

598
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,314
Oh, my God.

599
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,717
Oh, my God.

600
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,847
- Are you sick?
- I don't know.

601
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,448
- What'd you eat?
- I haven't eaten today yet.

602
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,527
- You haven't...
- Do you have, like, a napkin or something?

603
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,028
Here, here.

604
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,389
What, do you have,
like, the flu?

605
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,899
I don't know.

606
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,402
God, I hope you're not pregnant.

607
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,928
It's impossible. You have
to have sex to get pregnant.

608
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,278
B.K. It's Brent Master Five.

609
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,937
Allison just puked.

610
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,654
Dude, that's what I said.
She's probably

611
00:25:18,754 --> 00:25:19,384
pregnant, right?

612
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,611
- Oh, shit.
- How does she look right now?

613
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,374
She looks like she just realized

614
00:25:23,474 --> 00:25:24,489
that she's pregnant.

615
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,750
No, I can't be pregnant. Right?

616
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,487
I mean that was, what?

617
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,289
- Eight weeks ago? When was that?
- Mmm-hmm.

618
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,261
Did you miss your period?

619
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,730
No. Wait.

620
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,745
I don't know.
Shit. I don't know.

621
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:37,536
I can't remember.

622
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,627
I was... I mean, I've been
really stressed at work.

623
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,262
I can't remember my last period.

624
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,170
Are you the lady who doesn't
realize she's pregnant

625
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,502
till she's sitting on the toilet

626
00:25:44,602 --> 00:25:45,310
and a kid pops out?

627
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,002
Can you not joke right now?
Don't joke right now.

628
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,012
- This is really serious.
- Did I meet him?

629
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,480
Yeah. You know, he was
kind of like medium height,

630
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:55,019
sort of chubby.
Blonde, curly hair. Remember?

631
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,849
- With the man-boobs.
- Yes.

632
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,210
Here, I have this thing of him on my phone.

633
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,225
I just watched it.

634
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,759
Hey! I live in your phone!

635
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,124
Oh.

636
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,763
This is the best night of my life.

637
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,800
I gotta pee.

638
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,460
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

639
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,963
- How did this happen?
- Oh, shit.

640
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,008
Well, there's only one way to find out.

641
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,113
They're here!
Here they are! Over here!

642
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,375
Oh, no.

643
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,246
- Okay, here we are.
- Okay.

644
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,650
Okay. All right.
Here.

645
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:41,855
Oh, no. Give me more!
Give me a few more!

646
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,696
Did you try the Ova-Sure?

647
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,201
I'm dripping,
I'm dripping. Wait.

648
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,637
Oh, good! A smiley face!

649
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,965
Oh, I think that's bad.

650
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,307
How long does this one take?

651
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,407
These can't all be positive.
Let me try one.

652
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,215
God, you really had to pee.

653
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:10,426
What is this?
What the hell is this?

654
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,288
I think you picked up the wrong one.

655
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,662
Oh, fuck.

656
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,391
That scared me.

657
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,027
That would suck. I'm sorry.

658
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,905
That scared me.

659
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,841
It's gonna be fine. Right?

660
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:29,602
Right?

661
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,514
Of course it will be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

662
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,017
You just need to call him.

663
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,553
Maybe I don't need to call him
until after I see the doctor.

664
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,054
- You need to call.
- I don't want to call him.

665
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,750
- I don't need to call him.
- You should call.

666
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,190
I can't call him anyway.
He doesn't even have a phone.

667
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,693
He didn't even have a number to give me.

668
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:44,786
He doesn't have a phone?

669
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,490
Said he had some kind of billing issue.

670
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:49,533
He can't afford a phone?
Sadie has a phone.

671
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,035
Oh, shit, you're right.
I got to call.

672
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,665
I don't know. I'm gonna have to look him up

673
00:27:53,765 --> 00:27:54,539
on his stupid website.

674
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:55,901
What kind of website does he have?

675
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,039
He spelled 'coming' wrong. Oh, it's cum...

676
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,238
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's gross.

677
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,281
Just go to 'Contact Us.'

678
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:06,879
- Ben?
- Yeah.

679
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,711
'What is your number?
I need to speak

680
00:28:10,811 --> 00:28:11,990
with you right away.'

681
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,455
- Send?
- Yep.

682
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,150
You're sure?

683
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,488
Yeah.

684
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,788
I love weed.

685
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,958
I could smoke weed every second of every day.

686
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:26,128
Jay, I am your stoner.

687
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,676
- Hey, Benjamin?
- Yeah.

688
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,079
- Flesh of the Stars just got an e-mail.
- Really?

689
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,618
- Would you like me to read it to you?
- Yeah, sure.

690
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,984
'Ben, what is your number?

691
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,525
'I need to speak to you
right away. Allison Scott.'

692
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,651
Oh! Shit!

693
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,961
Someone wants seconds, mama!

694
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,293
Oh, man!

695
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,833
'Looking forward to speaking with you.'

696
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,134
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do one of those

697
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:00,871
smiley faces at the end.

698
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,462
Fucking-A. Those are sexy.
Sent.

699
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,912
Somebody wants another piece!

700
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,208
Booty-booty call.

701
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,014
- Yeah, hello?
- Hi.

702
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,028
Hey, Ben, this is...
This is Allison. I don't know

703
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:20,225
if you remember me.

704
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,885
Oh, yeah, Allison. What's up?

705
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,462
She like the way your dick tastes.

706
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,728
Yeah, I actually was
just wondering if maybe you

707
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,064
wanted to get together,
like tomorrow night?

708
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,747
I've been meaning to call you so we could,

709
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:34,572
like, hook up again.

710
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,503
- You know what I'm saying?
- Okay, cool.

711
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,407
Let's meet up maybe tomorrow night? You wanna

712
00:29:38,507 --> 00:29:39,377
just grab some dinner?

713
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:43,174
Yeah. Why not?
Meeting of minds sounds good.

714
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:47,048
What do you say Geisha House,
Hollywood, 9:00?

715
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,346
Sure, sure. That's cool.

716
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,756
Can we make it more like 6:00, though?

717
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:50,755
I'd like to keep it early.

718
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,941
6:00. Beat the rush.
Yeah, leaves

719
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,659
more time for afterwards.

720
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,283
Dessert. Sweet.

721
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,619
Okay, great.

722
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,529
So, yeah. I'll just meet
you there, then, at 6:00.

723
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,567
- Yeah.
- I'll see you there.

724
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,498
Okay, take care. Peace.

725
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,701
Oh, shit.

726
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,539
I'm gonna get laid,
motherfucker!

727
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,442
Yes! Yes!

728
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,278
- Nice place, huh?
- Yeah, it's really nice.

729
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,535
Sorry it took so long to
get a table. I didn't realize

730
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:24,622
you needed a reservation.

731
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,053
Oh, no, that's okay.

732
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,421
- So how's work?
- Great.

733
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,617
- How's E!?
- Great.

734
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,250
That's awesome.
Do you know Vince Vaughn?

735
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:31,589
- Have you ever met him?
- No.

736
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,959
I really feel like
we'd get along well. I just...

737
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:35,166
He seems like a fun guy.

738
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,131
- I feel like we'd, like, hang together well.
- Mmm-hmm.

739
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,226
I feel like he'd like me.

740
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,074
I'm sure a lot of guys are like, 'Oh, I'd like

741
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:41,272
to hang out with that celeb',

742
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,335
but I really think he would
want to hang out with me,

743
00:30:43,435 --> 00:30:44,275
is like the cool thing.

744
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,240
I'm sure he would. Yeah.

745
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,608
- You look very pretty, though.
- Thanks.

746
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,043
- By the way.
- Yeah, I just thought...

747
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,444
I don't know, I thought maybe it'd be cool

748
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:51,640
to hang out a little bit and...

749
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:52,948
We didn't really get to talk that much

750
00:30:53,048 --> 00:30:53,852
last time, so I thought...

751
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,419
That we didn't.

752
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,412
I thought maybe we'd just talk and get to know

753
00:30:59,512 --> 00:31:00,391
each other better.

754
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,459
Cool. Okay.

755
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,052
- I'll start. I'm Canadian.
- Oh, that's cool.

756
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,963
From Vancouver. I live
here illegally, actually.

757
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,125
Don't tell anyone.

758
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,951
But it works out in my advantage,

759
00:31:12,051 --> 00:31:13,071
I think, ultimately,

760
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,162
'cause I don't have to pay any taxes.

761
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:18,572
So financially that's helpful

762
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,168
'cause I don't have a lot of money.

763
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,643
You know, I mean,
I'm not poor or anything,

764
00:31:23,743 --> 00:31:25,383
but I eat a lot of spaghetti.

765
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,369
So, you know, the web page
or whatever is just something

766
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,754
that you guys do for fun?

767
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,151
Do you have a real job?

768
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,814
- Well, that is our job.
- Oh.

769
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:36,052
We don't technically get money
for the hours we put in,

770
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:37,560
but it is our job.

771
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,460
- So, how do you... Right.
- How do I pay rent and shit?

772
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,657
When I was in high school,
I got ran over by a postal truck.

773
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:42,926
- Oh, my God.
- It just kind of...

774
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,662
It was my foot more than anything.

775
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,796
But I got like 14 grand from
the British Columbia government.

776
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,500
- Right.
- And that really lasted me.

777
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,939
I mean, until now.

778
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,171
It's been almost 10 years.
I have like 900 bucks left.

779
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,281
So that should last me for,
like, I mean, I'm not

780
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,015
a mathematician,

781
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,067
but like another two years or some shit.

782
00:31:59,167 --> 00:31:59,517
I think.

783
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:00,675
Yeah.

784
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,753
So I have something I really need to tell you.

785
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,448
It's kind of why I called you.

786
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,514
Here goes. Um...

787
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,457
I'm pregnant.

788
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,051
- Fuck off.
- What?

789
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,993
- What?
- I'm pregnant.

790
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,332
With emotion?

791
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,834
With a baby.
You're the father.

792
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,627
- I'm the father?
- Yes.

793
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,195
- How the fuck could this happen?
- I don't know.

794
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,628
I don't know. I mean,
I thought you were

795
00:32:23,728 --> 00:32:24,275
wearing a condom.

796
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,501
- No.
- What?

797
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,043
- I wasn't.
- Why not?

798
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,373
Because you told me not to.

799
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,878
What are you talking about?

800
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,812
What am I talking about?
You told me not to.

801
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,351
I did not tell you not to wear a condom.

802
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,545
Here's what happened, okay?

803
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,088
I will give you a play-by-play of my memory.

804
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,851
I almost had the condom on my dick.

805
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,799
It was on the cusp,
and then you said,

806
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:42,994
'Just do it, already.'

807
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,425
I didn't mean do it without a condom.

808
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,258
I meant 'do it' like 'hurry up,'

809
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,491
like 'Get fucking going!'

810
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,152
Well, I assumed you were wearing a patch,

811
00:32:49,252 --> 00:32:50,001
or like a dental dam

812
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,520
or one of those fucking butterfly clips

813
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,437
or something like that.

814
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,266
- What the hell is a dental dam?
- It's like Saran Wrap!

815
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,670
It's disgusting, okay?
But I thought you had one.

816
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,606
Why the fuck didn't you
stop me once we started?

817
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,076
I don't know! I couldn't tell
that you didn't have one on!

818
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,612
Obviously, I was drunk!

819
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,011
Was your vagina drunk?

820
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:05,389
Did you think it's the thinnest condom

821
00:33:05,489 --> 00:33:06,117
on earth I have on?

822
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,879
I'm a fucking inventor?
I made a dick-skin condom?

823
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,581
He hollowed out a penis and put it on?

824
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,850
What the fuck?

825
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,623
You are unbelievable.

826
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:23,230
Okay, you know what? Maybe
I've reacted unfavorably.

827
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,270
So what happens now?
I don't know how this works.

828
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,771
I am going to the doctor next week,

829
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,861
and I thought you could come with me

830
00:33:30,961 --> 00:33:32,043
to the gynecologist.

831
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,804
- So you haven't seen him, though?
- No.

832
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,276
So you don't know if you're pregnant.

833
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,248
- Well, I'm not 100% sure.
- You're not 100% sure.

834
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,784
I bet you're not pregnant.

835
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,223
No, they're not.

836
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,922
No, they're all in the bag.
They're in the bag.

837
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,533
Allison Scott?

838
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,164
Yeah. Come on.

839
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,232
- I'm supposed to come?
- Yes.

840
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,781
Hello. My name is Thomas Pellagrino.

841
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,146
I'm... I'm Ben Stone.

842
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,083
- Hi, there, champ.
- Nice to meet you.

843
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,781
- And you must be Debbie's sister.
- Yeah.

844
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,083
- Alice.
- Allison. Hi.

845
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,057
- Hi. How are you?
- Good.

846
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,525
So, what can I help you with today,

847
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:24,905
Mr. and Mrs. Stone?

848
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,362
I took a home pregnancy test,
and it said I was pregnant,

849
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,491
so here we are.

850
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,892
Okay. Let's have a look.

851
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,430
Legs up.

852
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,741
Nice office.

853
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,077
Thank you.

854
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,687
Well, you do look a lot like your sister.

855
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,594
This is gonna be cold.
And you're next.

856
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,699
Okay, there is the cervix and the uterus.

857
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,938
See that?

858
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:17,174
That dark sac there,
that's the amniotic sac.

859
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:21,212
And right there in the middle is the embryo.

860
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,810
Do you see that flicker?
You know what that is?

861
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,981
Yeah, that's a heartbeat.

862
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,820
Yeah, it looks like you are pregnant.

863
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,292
About eight or nine weeks,
I'd say.

864
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,953
Congratulations.

865
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,600
That... That's it?

866
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,793
Yep.

867
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,666
Take good care of it.

868
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,298
Now the fun part starts.

869
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,135
Let me... Let me make a picture for you, huh?

870
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,735
That'll be fun.

871
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,510
Okay. Well, I'll...
I'll meet you in my office.

872
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:57,849
Okay.

873
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,615
I'll give you a little time alone, there.

874
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,663
Oh, God.
Oh, no.

875
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:10,893
It's okay.

876
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,402
I can't fucking believe you didn't wear a bag!

877
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,596
Who does that?

878
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,361
Why did we go to Costco and buy a year's supply

879
00:36:16,461 --> 00:36:16,774
of condoms

880
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,034
if you weren't gonna use them, man?

881
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,077
I can't believe you did this.
You fucked everything up.

882
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,682
Look, the real point is not to get yourself

883
00:36:21,782 --> 00:36:22,346
in this position.

884
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:23,777
That's what you have to realize.

885
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,940
You gotta know all the tricks.

886
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,525
Like, for example,
if a woman's on top,

887
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:27,518
she can't get pregnant.

888
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:28,898
It's just gravity.
Well, that's true.

889
00:36:28,998 --> 00:36:29,687
Everyone knows that.

890
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,186
What goes up must come down.

891
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:34,349
I think it's awesome that
you're gonna have a kid, man.

892
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,945
Think about it like this.
It's just an excuse to play

893
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:38,429
with all your old toys again.

894
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,996
You know what I think you should do?

895
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,032
Take care of it.

896
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,463
Tell me you don't want him to get an 'A' word.

897
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,807
Yes, I do, and I won't say it
for little Baby Ears

898
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:47,371
over there,

899
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,871
but it rhymes with 'Shma-shmortion.'

900
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,205
I'm just saying...
Hold on, Jay, cover your ears.

901
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,140
You should get a shma-shmortion

902
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,980
at the shma-shmortion clinic.

903
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,954
Ben, you cannot let these monsters have

904
00:36:58,054 --> 00:36:59,484
any part of your child's life.

905
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,451
All right? I'm gonna be
there to rear your child.

906
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,248
You hear that, Ben?
Don't let him near the kid.

907
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,654
He wants to rear your child!

908
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,088
I just have a quick question.

909
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,794
Do you use that Canadian
flag tattoo as a cum target

910
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:11,529
of some sort?

911
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,757
How many points do you get if you hit
the leaf? Like a million?

912
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,595
Jonah, I am a patriot.

913
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,329
This is a tribute to my
country and my countrymen.

914
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,598
I always aim right.

915
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,572
Right into a dude's ass.

916
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,908
Please, guys.

917
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,140
- Ben, Come on, man.
- I'm just kidding you.

918
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,273
- Oh, great. Now he's upset.
- I won't let him do it.

919
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,316
Allison, just take care of it.

920
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:36,946
Take care of it. Move on.

921
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,283
What's gonna happen with your career?

922
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,721
How are you gonna tell them?

923
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,984
I'm not gonna tell them for a while.

924
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,026
I have a while before I have to say anything.

925
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,119
How could you not tell them?
They're not gonna know.

926
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,959
I mean, I'm only gonna start
to show when I'm like,

927
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,684
I don't know,
six months or something.

928
00:37:48,784 --> 00:37:49,333
Seven months.

929
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,923
- Three months.
- No.

930
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:54,199
Three months. Fat in the face,
jowls, fat ass.

931
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,599
Debbie didn't get fat.

932
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,539
Debbie is a freak of nature.

933
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,749
Mom, you know,
it's important to me

934
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:02,280
that you be supportive.

935
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,890
I cannot be supportive
of this. This is a mistake.

936
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,350
This is a big, big mistake.

937
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,145
Now, think about your stepsister.

938
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,550
Now, you remember what happened with her?

939
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,567
She had the same situation as you,

940
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,291
and she had it taken care of.

941
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,383
And you know what?
Now she has a real baby.

942
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,394
Honey, this is not the time.

943
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,730
I'm gonna be a grandfather.

944
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:21,923
You happy about that?

945
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,660
Absolutely. Delighted.

946
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:24,826
This is a disaster.

947
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,096
No, this is not a disaster.

948
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,695
- It is...
- An earthquake is a disaster.

949
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,831
Your grandmother having Alzheimer's so bad

950
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,630
she doesn't even know who the fuck I am,

951
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:33,477
that's a disaster.

952
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,477
This is a good thing.
This is a blessing.

953
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:39,482
I have a vision for how my life would go,

954
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,074
and this definitely is not it.

955
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,867
Wait. Is this your vision?
Are you living

956
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:43,888
your vision right now?

957
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,182
I am kind of living my vision, yeah.

958
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,087
Well, that is sad,
I'm telling you.

959
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,592
Life doesn't care about your vision. Okay?

960
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:52,026
Stuff happens.
You just got to deal with it.

961
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,929
You roll with it.
That's the beauty of it all.

962
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,434
I just don't get how I tell
the kid not to do drugs

963
00:38:57,534 --> 00:38:58,269
when I do drugs.

964
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,563
I'll feel like a hypocrite.

965
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,730
Well, remember what I told you
when you were a teenager?

966
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,774
- What did you say?
- I said, 'No pills, no powders.'

967
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:05,933
That's right, that's right.

968
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,518
Right. If it grows in the ground,

969
00:39:07,618 --> 00:39:08,446
it's probably okay.

970
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,461
I mean, I guess it worked.
Like you told me not

971
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:11,749
to smoke pot all those years,

972
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,959
and then I found out you were smoking pot

973
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:14,852
that whole time.

974
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,442
Not the whole time.

975
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,284
Just in the evenings and all day every weekend.

976
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,914
Not that much.

977
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,886
Honestly, though,
when you look at me

978
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,361
do you not think at all, like,

979
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,057
'You know,
if he just never existed,

980
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,892
'I would have avoided
a massive heap of trouble,'

981
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:31,469
you know?

982
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,196
Absolutely not.

983
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,431
I love you totally and completely.

984
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,905
You're the best thing that ever happened to me.

985
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,533
I'm the best thing that ever happened to you?

986
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,804
Yeah.

987
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:44,138
Now I just feel bad for you.

988
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:53,984
- Hello?
- Hi. Ben?

989
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,758
Oh. Hey, Allison.

990
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,893
- How's it going?
- Good, good.

991
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,159
You know,
I was just calling to...

992
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,494
To let you know that I've
decided to keep the baby.

993
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,128
I'm keeping it.

994
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,399
Oh.

995
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:14,172
Yeah. So, that's what's happening with that.

996
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,769
Good. That's good. That's what
I was hoping you'd do.

997
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,441
So, awesome.

998
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,576
Yeah. Yeah, it is good.

999
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,181
Okay, I know we didn't plan this,

1000
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,115
and, you know,
neither of us really thought

1001
00:40:27,215 --> 00:40:28,059
it was gonna happen,

1002
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,683
but life is like that,
you know,

1003
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,387
you can't plan for it.

1004
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,827
And even if we did plan,

1005
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:35,695
life doesn't care about
your plans, necessarily.

1006
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,084
And you just kind of have
to go with the flow and,

1007
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:38,569
you know,

1008
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:41,613
I know my job is to just
support you in whatever

1009
00:40:41,713 --> 00:40:42,873
it is you wanna do,

1010
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:44,873
and, I'm in, you know.

1011
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,670
So whatever you wanna do,

1012
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,507
I'm gonna do,
you know. It's...

1013
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,048
I'm on board. Yay!

1014
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,849
I really appreciate you saying that.

1015
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,944
No problem.
You know, so I'll tell you,

1016
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:01,549
you know, maybe if you could
help me by telling me, like,

1017
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,059
one thing that I am supposed to do,

1018
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,789
then that would be good,

1019
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,161
because I literally have no idea whatsoever.

1020
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,462
I have no idea, either.

1021
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:15,183
So, do you want to, like,
get together and talk about it

1022
00:41:15,283 --> 00:41:16,640
or something like that?

1023
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,537
- Yeah, sure.
- Like a date? I mean...

1024
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,007
Yeah.

1025
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,413
- Hey.
- Hi.

1026
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,648
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1027
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,486
No problem. Come on in.

1028
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,683
- Everyone, this is Allison.
- Hi.

1029
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,696
- Ally. Hey. Jason, I'm sure you remember.
- Yes.

1030
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,163
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1031
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,895
Your body's responding
really well to the pregnancy.

1032
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,060
Thank you.

1033
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,229
It's amazing how fast the milk arrives.

1034
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:49,704
Oh.

1035
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:50,865
How's your sis?

1036
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,033
She's good.

1037
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,373
- Oh, good. Tell her, 'What's up?' for me.
- Okay.

1038
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:57,107
All right, I'm gonna go make a protein shake.

1039
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,379
And this beautiful young man is Jonah.

1040
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,851
- Hi.
- Hey.

1041
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,582
Okay, that's Martin and Jodi over there.

1042
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,784
Hi.

1043
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,795
I'm gonna grab my shirt.
Just take a seat if you want.

1044
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,194
- Okay.
- Cool.

1045
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:23,464
You are scared, aren't you?

1046
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,747
- Just another day at the office.
- Uh-huh.

1047
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,549
Do you have any acting experience?

1048
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,089
No. Uh-huh.

1049
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,625
How's it going?
You wanna toke?

1050
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,956
No. I'm good.

1051
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,154
- Hi.
- Hi.

1052
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,493
- I'm Jodi.
- Yeah, hi.

1053
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,396
- I heard you were pregnant.
- Mmm-hmm.

1054
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,264
Oh, aren't you scared?

1055
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,770
The way it's gonna come out of your...

1056
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,807
It's gonna hurt a lot, I bet.
Your vagina...

1057
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,001
That's so sick.

1058
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,237
I don't know.

1059
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,677
Are you hungry?

1060
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,737
No, I'm okay right now.
Thank you.

1061
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,576
You must be angry at the baby whenever

1062
00:43:06,676 --> 00:43:07,818
it steals your food, huh?

1063
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,613
'Oh, it's mine, not yours.'

1064
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,442
But, you know,
because you're family,

1065
00:43:12,542 --> 00:43:13,817
you got to share.

1066
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:14,982
Right.

1067
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,027
Man, my balls are shaved.
My pubes are trimmed.

1068
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:20,460
I'm ready to fucking rock this shit.

1069
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:21,793
What the fuck, man?

1070
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,120
If I go in there and see
fucking pubes sprinkled

1071
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,102
on the toilet seat,

1072
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,102
I'm gonna fucking lose my mind!

1073
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,763
Last time I went to the bathroom, Jay,

1074
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,808
I took a shit and my shit looked
like a fucking stuffed animal!

1075
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,809
You're embarrassing me in company.

1076
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,310
You embarrass yourself.

1077
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,939
Oh, great. I hope you have a great evening!

1078
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,540
- All right. Let's go.
- Okay.

1079
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,118
See you guys later.

1080
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,539
The funny thing is I really
had never even thought

1081
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:48,692
about having a baby.

1082
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,885
- Yeah.
- I mean, if this hadn't happened,

1083
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,793
I don't think I would have
wanted to have a baby for like,

1084
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:56,230
- I don't know, at least 10 years.
- At least!

1085
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,131
God, I mean, honestly,
I just got used to the, like,

1086
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,967
notion that someone would even
have sex with me.

1087
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,234
I didn't think this would happen.

1088
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,401
Get ready.

1089
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,239
This will be coming out of you in seven months.

1090
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,243
This is exactly what our baby will look like.

1091
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:14,010
- It's a beautiful picture, Ben.
- It is. It's not bad.

1092
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,210
Hello, Mommy.

1093
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,946
Our baby's gonna be French-Canadian.

1094
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,181
With a little hint of Spanish.

1095
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:21,190
Exactly. I'm not good with accents, but...

1096
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:23,385
- Baby books.
- Awesome.

1097
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,018
'What to Expect When You're Expecting.'

1098
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,460
What can we expect?

1099
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,363
Well, you can't eat sushi.

1100
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,232
You can't smoke.

1101
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,736
You can't smoke marijuana.
You can't smoke crack.

1102
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,533
You can't jump on trampolines.

1103
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:39,303
This is basically a giant list
of things you can't do.

1104
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:40,866
Yeah, it sounds thrilling.

1105
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,054
I'm gonna be sitting there on the trampoline

1106
00:44:43,154 --> 00:44:43,781
smoking crack.

1107
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,199
And you're not gonna have anything to do.

1108
00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:45,983
You're gonna be bored.

1109
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,710
But I can't wait to read these, honestly.

1110
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,479
Seriously, I put these
in front of my toilet, though,

1111
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,248
they'll be read by tomorrow morning.

1112
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,686
- Do you want me to get you that?
- Yeah.

1113
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:54,155
- You like it?
- Yeah, thank you.

1114
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,486
No problem.

1115
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,220
These are heavy.

1116
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,735
So what do you think?
Should we have sex tonight?

1117
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,101
Sounds awful.

1118
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,779
I'm just really constipated.

1119
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,084
Do you really want to?

1120
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,484
Well, now...

1121
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,954
Shut up.

1122
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,956
It's pretty crazy,
your sister's pregnant.

1123
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,458
We have to help her.

1124
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:32,393
I think they'll be fine.
Look at us. It happened to us.

1125
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,658
We'll help her raise the baby.

1126
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:35,960
Well...

1127
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,029
Fuck!

1128
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:48,241
At least we don't have
to use a condom, you know?

1129
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,185
But we can. I don't...
I brought some

1130
00:45:51,285 --> 00:45:52,516
just in case. I don't...

1131
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:55,050
I don't have VD or anything.
I mean, I don't, I thought...

1132
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,347
It's not that.

1133
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,751
You know, it's just...

1134
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:00,733
I thought maybe we could get
a little fun out of

1135
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,359
your situation, you know?

1136
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,370
Okay, first of all,
it's not my situation.

1137
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,329
It's our situation.

1138
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,726
I know, of course,
I know that.

1139
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,628
And just because I'm pregnant,
I'm not some ruined woman

1140
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,131
and all romance goes out the door.

1141
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,134
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

1142
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,271
It's just...

1143
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,341
I like you a lot.
That's all this is. That's...

1144
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,341
I like you, too.

1145
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:25,813
Sweet.

1146
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,814
A little, so far.

1147
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,852
I mean, we have seven months
before the baby comes.

1148
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,614
- We don't have to rush it.
- Yeah.

1149
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,657
We should really just try
to get to know each other

1150
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,658
and give this a real shot.

1151
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,967
You know, we got ourselves into this situation.

1152
00:46:39,067 --> 00:46:39,930
We kind of have to.

1153
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,362
- For the baby, right?
- Exactly.

1154
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,335
Okay, if this was our second
date, what would you do?

1155
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:53,307
B.J., if I'm just being
honest, I would probably...

1156
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:56,198
I told my roommates I thought I was gonna

1157
00:46:56,298 --> 00:46:57,438
get a B.J., so...

1158
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:58,606
You know what?

1159
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:00,390
For the sake of getting to know one another,

1160
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:01,518
can you not talk like that?

1161
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:05,486
Yeah, I can do that.
I'm... I'm really nervous.

1162
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,421
I'm nervous, too.
I'm really nervous.

1163
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,049
Yeah.

1164
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,028
You're a sweet guy, right?

1165
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,574
I think I am. Yeah.

1166
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,701
Don't fuck me over, okay?

1167
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,807
I wouldn't do that.

1168
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:34,048
Just so you know,
I'm the guy girls fuck over.

1169
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,244
I'm that guy.
So you don't fuck me over.

1170
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,411
- Okay?
- Okay.

1171
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,854
I couldn't take it.
I can't raise this baby alone.

1172
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,638
Who's he?

1173
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,336
I'm Ben Stone.

1174
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,109
He's my boyfriend.

1175
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:06,742
That's nice.

1176
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,511
I've never met him before.

1177
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,416
Well, he's a new boyfriend.

1178
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,714
But a boyfriend.

1179
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,661
So he came over for breakfast because

1180
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:14,958
he's your new boyfriend?

1181
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,923
Yeah.
He came from his house.

1182
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,688
Drove over to our house

1183
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,319
because he thought it would be fun

1184
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:21,598
to have breakfast with us,

1185
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:24,616
so he drove his car from his house to our house

1186
00:48:24,716 --> 00:48:25,803
to have breakfast.

1187
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,030
Because he likes breakfast so much.

1188
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,039
I love breakfast.

1189
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:34,271
You guys wanna hear something neat?
We're gonna have a baby together.

1190
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,369
- What?
- Yeah, a baby.

1191
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,777
Well, you're not married.

1192
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,974
Aren't you supposed
to be married to have a baby?

1193
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,277
You don't have to be.

1194
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,615
But they should be
because they love each other,

1195
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,212
and people who love each other
get married and have babies.

1196
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,280
Mmm-mmm.

1197
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,388
Do you love each other?

1198
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,793
Yes, they love each other.
Because that's what you do.

1199
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:56,699
When you love each other,
you get married

1200
00:48:56,799 --> 00:48:57,890
and have a baby.

1201
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,629
Where do babies come from?

1202
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,727
Where do you think they come from?

1203
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:05,104
Well, I think a stork,
he drops it down,

1204
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,268
and then a hole goes in your body,

1205
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,744
and there's blood everywhere,
coming out of your head,

1206
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,629
and then you push your belly button,

1207
00:49:11,729 --> 00:49:13,183
and then your butt falls off,

1208
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,343
and then you hold your butt
and you have to dig,

1209
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,648
and you'll find a little baby.

1210
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,620
That's exactly right.

1211
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,855
Feed the Teddy bear.

1212
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,485
Okay, I feed your bear the grass?

1213
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,592
Okay.

1214
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,194
You know what your bear would also like

1215
00:49:31,294 --> 00:49:32,436
to do with some grass?

1216
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:33,867
Smoke it.

1217
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:37,471
What do you think of him?
He's funny, right?

1218
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,769
Mmm-hmm.

1219
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:40,469
Fetch.

1220
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,307
All right, bring it back.

1221
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,171
He's playing fetch with my kids.

1222
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,749
He's treating my kids like they're dogs.

1223
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,216
No, he's not.

1224
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:49,513
Go get it! Fetch!

1225
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,520
Who plays fetch with kids?

1226
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,714
He's trying.
He's making an effort.

1227
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,224
- Bring it back.
- He's overweight.

1228
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,691
Where does that end?

1229
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,557
- How old is he?
- 23.

1230
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,028
Looks 33.

1231
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:04,361
He can barely get in and out
of that little house.

1232
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,402
Imagine how much bigger he's gonna get.

1233
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,698
That means he has bad genes.

1234
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,035
Your kid is gonna be overweight.

1235
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,405
Shit.

1236
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,033
I'm gonna get you!

1237
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,407
I'm gonna get...

1238
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,047
Just give him a break.

1239
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,981
Okay. I'll try.

1240
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,160
They seem to love bubbles.

1241
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,360
Oh, God. They go ape shit over bubbles.

1242
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:39,527
They're really going ape shit.

1243
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:43,095
I mean, that's an incredible
thing about a child.

1244
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,696
I mean, what's so great about bubbles?

1245
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:47,938
They float. You can pop them.
I mean, I get it. I get it.

1246
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,208
I wish I liked anything as much
as my kids like bubbles.

1247
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,613
- That's sad.
- It's totally sad.

1248
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:57,233
Their smiling faces just
point out your inability

1249
00:50:57,333 --> 00:50:58,620
to enjoy anything.

1250
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,713
Am I gonna be okay, man?

1251
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:03,616
Oh, who knows?

1252
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,789
Is anybody okay? I'm not okay.

1253
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,421
You're asking the wrong guy.

1254
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:11,592
Just don't ask me to lend you
any money, you know?

1255
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,566
Can I just have some?

1256
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,530
No.

1257
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,500
I have 15 years of tennis lessons.

1258
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,741
And 12 years of sucking dick lessons.

1259
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:25,907
So?

1260
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:27,643
I can't ref the next games,
by the way.

1261
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,720
I got to go meet gynecologists with Allison.

1262
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,778
She doesn't like her gynecologist.

1263
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:35,289
- You think she likes you?
- She's trying to.

1264
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:39,093
- She's entertaining the idea of liking you.
- Exactly. I'll take that.

1265
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:41,562
Yeah, well, see, she's bringing you
to the gynaechiatrist.

1266
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,826
- She must like you.
- Yeah. Pretty good, I think.

1267
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,664
You know who I'd like to get pregnant,
is that Felicity Huffman, man.

1268
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,170
Ever since TransAmerica, I can't
get her out of my mind.

1269
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,502
Okay, guys. I hate to crack the whip,

1270
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,736
but it's kind of business meeting time.

1271
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,176
I need moolah.

1272
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,804
- When do you think we can launch this site?
- Jeez.

1273
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:00,405
Look, man. You can't rush this.

1274
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,179
You know what happens
to these sites when they go up

1275
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,946
and they don't function well?
They die.

1276
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,512
Seriously, guys, let's say
I want to launch today.

1277
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,422
Let's start. Let's use that
as a jumping off point.

1278
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,519
Let's make this happen.
What can we do?

1279
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,617
Look, man, I didn't go to Yale so I could work

1280
00:52:14,717 --> 00:52:15,332
12 hours a day.

1281
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,956
I thought you went
to Santa Monica City College.

1282
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,591
I went where I went, Jason.

1283
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,533
I'm not asking you to work 12 hours a day.

1284
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,265
I mean, you guys watch movies
without nudity in them.

1285
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,928
I'll tell you what, man.
We could probably

1286
00:52:25,028 --> 00:52:26,176
get it online in three months.

1287
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,937
Thank you. Yes! Three months.

1288
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,876
Come on, Jason!

1289
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,379
Fuck off!

1290
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,847
Yeah, well, you still have
a little dick, Cartman.

1291
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,881
- Do you have mints?
- Yeah, right there.

1292
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,852
I see what you're saying.
Totally.

1293
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:40,060
I don't get how you're comfortable

1294
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:40,857
with any of these guys

1295
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:42,652
when they're doing what they're doing to you.

1296
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,853
First guy...

1297
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:47,725
Oh, there that shit is.
I've been looking for that.

1298
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,560
The first guy,
when he put his finger in,

1299
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,767
he gave me this look like,

1300
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:53,962
'Sorry, man, it's the job'
and I'm like, 'Don't look

1301
00:52:54,062 --> 00:52:55,739
at me when your finger's...'

1302
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,149
I mean, get in and get out.
Get on with your day,

1303
00:52:58,249 --> 00:52:58,642
you know?

1304
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,921
That's the closest I'll ever come to being

1305
00:53:01,021 --> 00:53:02,245
in a threesome, I think.

1306
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,403
Really?

1307
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,087
If you had to do a threesome with me and one

1308
00:53:05,187 --> 00:53:05,949
of my other roommates,

1309
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,641
who would it be?

1310
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:08,706
Um...

1311
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:10,410
I'm gonna have to go with Jay.

1312
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:11,715
Oh, no.

1313
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:12,981
- Yeah.
- Jay?

1314
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:16,219
I'm really turned on by his
sort of skinny awkwardness

1315
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:19,090
- and his hot little Mohawk.
- His Mohawk.

1316
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,529
You two are never allowed to be in
the same room ever again.

1317
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,695
If we ever had a three-way
with Jay, you turn around,

1318
00:53:24,795 --> 00:53:25,735
he'd be sucking my dick.

1319
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:26,927
I'm telling you right now.

1320
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,505
- Do you smoke cigarettes?
- No.

1321
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:32,269
Do you smoke cigarettes?

1322
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,775
I have on occasion.

1323
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:36,073
On occasion? When? When was
the last time you had one cig?

1324
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,646
You know, one, you know, little...

1325
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,342
I need to know,
or I will not be your doctor.

1326
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,681
How you doing?

1327
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:46,916
I'm breathing like James Gandolfini over here.

1328
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:49,456
Slow down, man.
You're making me look

1329
00:53:49,556 --> 00:53:50,360
like a jackass.

1330
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,121
How long you kids been married?

1331
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,526
- We're not.
- No.

1332
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:54,586
You're single?

1333
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,030
She's not single.
She's just not married.

1334
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,091
Are you two together?

1335
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,361
Hey, you wanna trade boyfriends?

1336
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,770
Just kidding. Kind of.

1337
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:15,149
That is not your vagina.
That's your asshole.

1338
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,117
That happens about five times a day.

1339
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:19,718
Are you sure you don't wanna come paintballing?

1340
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,984
Have fun, guys. Seriously.
Watch the eyes.

1341
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,889
- See you, guys.
- See you, Ally. Bye.

1342
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,293
I don't wanna go.
I swear to God.

1343
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,957
I wanna see Breathless at the LACMA.

1344
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,635
Boobs! Boobs, boobs, boobs!

1345
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,136
Hold on, pause it,
pause it, pause it.

1346
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,763
Boobs and bush!
Boobs and bush.

1347
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,501
- Good boobs.
- Those are good ones!

1348
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,405
We're like 35 seconds in. Nice.

1349
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,308
- Right in the beginning credits.
- Credit bush.

1350
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,846
- You never get opening credit bush.
- I know. That's so crazy.

1351
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:46,642
No.

1352
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,684
You got me.

1353
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,580
You got me.

1354
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,415
How many doctors are there in your practice?

1355
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,159
Just 'cause I'm sort of looking for a more

1356
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,027
personal experience.

1357
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,200
I wanna make sure that you're my doctor

1358
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,230
on the day, and...

1359
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,127
Yeah, I understand.

1360
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:05,441
We have three other doctors in the practice,

1361
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:07,037
but I'm your man, okay?

1362
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,867
I don't take vacations.
I hate Hawaii.

1363
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,405
I went to the Caribbean when I was 14,

1364
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,807
and I'm never going back.

1365
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,278
I feel really good about this.
I think we found our doctor.

1366
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,541
- Really?
- Yeah.

1367
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,910
All right.

1368
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,349
- Are you serious right now?
- Yeah.

1369
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,612
Wow.

1370
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,814
- You look relieved.
- I am very relieved.

1371
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,982
I can't imagine meeting any more of you people.

1372
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,923
You're being dramatic.
We didn't meet that many.

1373
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,867
Do they know?

1374
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:42,063
Pardon?

1375
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,240
The belly.

1376
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:47,936
Oh, yeah. The donuts,
they call to me.

1377
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:51,608
- Hey, Allison. Great job.
- Thanks.

1378
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,880
- You're pregnant, aren't you?
- What?

1379
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:59,546
I mean, you've put on like,
eight pounds, nine.

1380
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,556
It's all in your uterus.

1381
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:03,489
Oh, shit.

1382
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,111
I haven't told them.
Do you think

1383
00:56:06,211 --> 00:56:07,364
they're gonna be mad?

1384
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,955
I'm, like, really chickening out about this.

1385
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,058
It's okay. We can hide this.

1386
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:15,001
We'll dress you in black,
and we'll emphasize

1387
00:56:15,101 --> 00:56:15,772
your boobs.

1388
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,032
Awesome.

1389
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,700
I mean, your boobs are gonna be big.

1390
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:22,073
And then they're gonna be, like, scary big.

1391
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:25,807
But then they'll go down.
And then they'll stay down.

1392
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,417
Just... Just don't say anything, okay?

1393
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:28,551
Please don't say anything.

1394
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:32,417
Oh, no, I won't, I won't.
Just tell them. They'll be cool.

1395
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,883
Everybody loves somebody pregnant.

1396
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,923
Did you see this sex offender website?

1397
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:43,693
These are all the sex
offenders in our neighborhood.

1398
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,701
Looks like your computer has chicken pox.

1399
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,464
Those are sex offenders.

1400
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,870
These people live in our neighborhood.

1401
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,805
Well, I'll skip their houses
when we're trick-or-treating.

1402
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:55,276
What do you want me to do?
Form a posse?

1403
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,711
Got your six-shooter on you?
I got my lynching rope.

1404
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:59,008
You shouldn't take it so lightly.

1405
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,242
I don't take it lightly.

1406
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:02,055
You know, I'm not gonna go over to any of these

1407
00:57:02,155 --> 00:57:03,019
people's houses and say,

1408
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,212
'Hey, do you mind...
Can you baby-sit?'

1409
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:07,221
If I didn't care about these things,

1410
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,814
you wouldn't care about anything.

1411
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:10,052
Care more.

1412
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,578
You're so concerned with stuff, like

1413
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:12,729
'Don't get them vaccinated.

1414
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:15,127
'Don't let them eat fish.
There's mercury in the water.'

1415
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:17,792
Jesus, how much Dateline NBC can you watch?

1416
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,161
I know we're supposed to be nice

1417
00:57:19,261 --> 00:57:20,303
with each other right now,

1418
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:21,734
but I'm having a really hard time.

1419
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:23,965
- I'm struggling with it right now.
- What am I doing?

1420
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,708
'Cause I want to rip your
fucking head off because

1421
00:57:26,808 --> 00:57:28,144
you're so fucking stupid!

1422
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:31,509
- This is scary. These are our children.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

1423
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:35,381
- You fucking dipshit. God! You...
- Mmm-hmm.

1424
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:38,079
I literally am at a point where
I don't know what I can say.

1425
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,348
So I'm the bad guy

1426
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:41,999
because I'm trying to protect
our kids from child molesters

1427
00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:42,592
and mercury?

1428
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:45,092
And you're cool 'cause you don't give a shit.

1429
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,686
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Is that it?

1430
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:50,494
- Pretty much.
- God, you're an asshole.

1431
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,762
Don't do this in front of Ben.

1432
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,997
I don't give a shit about Ben.

1433
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:56,265
Sorry, Ben.

1434
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:58,330
It's okay. I didn't think she did, anyway.

1435
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,069
Okay, Come on! Let's go.

1436
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,770
Oh, I can't go.

1437
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,678
This band is doing a showcase
out in the Valley. I got to go.

1438
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:06,271
It's Saturday.

1439
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,077
I got to go.

1440
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,420
You don't want to know the sex of the baby?

1441
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,183
That's no fun.

1442
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:16,623
Ben knows, but I've sworn him to secrecy.

1443
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,387
I'll get it out of him.

1444
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,587
No.

1445
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:27,530
Hey.

1446
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:30,767
Think we'll ever be as happy
as Baby Bjrn couple is?

1447
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,603
We are that happy.

1448
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,433
Yeah. You look happy.

1449
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:35,986
Which is awesome,
'cause I never like

1450
00:58:36,086 --> 00:58:37,113
guys like you. It's great.

1451
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:38,976
You keep saying that. I know.

1452
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:41,312
This is it. This is perfect.

1453
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,416
Nice.

1454
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,420
Holy shit! It's 1,400 bucks.

1455
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:47,285
We can just borrow yours.
Is that okay?

1456
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,382
No. You need your own crib.

1457
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,350
You know, there's one
of these lying in an alley

1458
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:52,061
behind my house.

1459
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:54,823
We could just grab that.
Just rub Purell all over it.

1460
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,296
You know what? Let me buy it.

1461
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,197
I need to get you a baby present anyway.

1462
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,293
- And I would love to get it for you.
- No.

1463
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,665
I'm serious. I want to.

1464
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,706
No. It's too much.

1465
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:06,973
Yes. We'll take it.

1466
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:08,877
Obviously, I mean,
don't insult the woman.

1467
00:59:08,977 --> 00:59:10,146
She wants to get us a gift.

1468
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,304
Right.

1469
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:13,285
Wanna buy me some new shoes?
What else can I

1470
00:59:13,385 --> 00:59:14,184
squeeze out of you?

1471
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,115
Xbox 360. Xbox 360.

1472
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:19,778
So hot in the Valley.

1473
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:23,019
Hey! Oh, Allison!
Hi.

1474
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,684
How are you?

1475
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:27,285
It's so good to see you.

1476
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:29,422
We've been watching you on E!
It's the coolest thing.

1477
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,524
Yeah, it's been super
exciting, just crazy busy.

1478
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,124
I'm so sorry I haven't called.

1479
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:34,669
Oh, it's fine.
Hi, I'm Ashley.

1480
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:35,931
- This is my friend, Ben.
- I'm Ben.

1481
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,336
I went to school with Allison.

1482
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,340
Okay, so, is Debbie having another baby?

1483
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,809
No. Allison is.

1484
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:43,796
What? I just saw you a couple months ago.

1485
00:59:43,896 --> 00:59:44,614
You're pregnant?

1486
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,705
It was a big surprise.

1487
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:48,943
It's actually... It's a really
funny story, actually.

1488
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,508
If you guys... If you got a second to hear it.

1489
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,178
It's not really funny.
It's not funny.

1490
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,052
Let them be the judge, okay?
I think it's funny.

1491
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,955
- You know they say don't drink and drive?
- Uh-huh.

1492
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:59,392
- Don't drink and bone!
- Wow.

1493
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:00,553
Okay.

1494
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:03,721
Yeah, I mean,
she was acting weird,

1495
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,427
and I really think it's just 'cause, like,

1496
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,469
you know, I haven't made
an honest woman out of her.

1497
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:10,028
She's carrying my bastard child.
No one wants that.

1498
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,512
That's what I did.
I mean, I married Debbie

1499
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:12,308
when she got pregnant.

1500
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:13,966
You think she's, like,
hiding me?

1501
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,409
Like, she's, like, embarrassed
by me or something like that?

1502
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:18,571
Probably. I'd hide you.

1503
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,444
How much do wedding rings cost?

1504
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:21,983
I mean, it really depends,
you know?

1505
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,077
I think you're supposed to spend,
like, three months' pay on a ring.

1506
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,213
That'll be easy.
I don't make any money.

1507
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:29,814
Really? I thought there was
lot of money in porn.

1508
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:31,723
God, it's not porn, okay?

1509
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:34,400
All we do is we show you what nude scenes

1510
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,665
are in what movies.

1511
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,198
Oh, like Mr. Skin?

1512
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:38,528
Who's Mr. Skin?

1513
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,398
Dude, Mr. Skin.

1514
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:42,568
Mr. Skin?

1515
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,235
No!

1516
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,572
We've wasted 14 months of our lives.

1517
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,169
This is exactly the same as our site.

1518
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:51,508
How the fuck did this happen?

1519
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,845
Mr. Skin. That's even a better name than ours!

1520
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,076
Fuck me in the beard.

1521
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:57,379
Dude, they got the top 10 group shower scenes!

1522
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,852
Why didn't you think of that, Jay?

1523
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:00,354
Don't put this on me!

1524
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:01,515
God damn it!

1525
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:04,299
Well, shit, I saw it online
at one point, but I guess

1526
01:01:04,399 --> 01:01:05,728
I didn't connect the dots.

1527
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:06,988
What are we gonna do now?

1528
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:09,156
All we need to do is think
of a new, better idea

1529
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,927
that no one else has thought of already.

1530
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:13,764
Oh, dude, Spider-Man 3 starts in eight minutes.

1531
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,202
Don't worry, man.
We'll figure it out.

1532
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,578
You know what?

1533
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,673
I think just because this site exists

1534
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,082
doesn't mean our site won't work, necessarily.

1535
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,585
Good things come in pairs, man, you know.

1536
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,019
Oh, for sure.

1537
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:36,752
Volcano, Dante's Peak,
Deep Impact, Armageddon, right?

1538
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,520
Wyatt Earp, Tombstone.

1539
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:41,188
Panda Express,
Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.

1540
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,925
Exactly. We can work together.

1541
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,194
This can help us,
if anything, I think.

1542
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:46,599
We're fine. We're golden.

1543
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:51,025
Look, Allison, I'm sure
this isn't how you pictured

1544
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,108
it being, exactly,

1545
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,540
and it's not how I wanted it to be,

1546
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:57,636
but that is why I'm presenting
you this empty box.

1547
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:59,578
It's a promise, Allison.

1548
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:02,311
It's a promise that one day I will...

1549
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:05,638
I will fill this box
with a ring that you deserve,

1550
01:02:05,738 --> 01:02:06,823
a beautiful ring.

1551
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,481
And I can't afford it yet.

1552
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:11,720
I've picked it out already,
though, and it's at De Beers,

1553
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,962
and it's really nice.

1554
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:17,465
So basically I'm asking you,
will you marry me?

1555
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,161
Because I'm in love with you.

1556
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,972
I love you, too.

1557
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,530
Really?

1558
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:27,838
Oh, man,
that's so nice to hear.

1559
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:31,778
That's the first time a girl's
ever said that to me, so...

1560
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,974
But here's the thing.

1561
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:36,484
There's a thing?

1562
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:40,522
I don't really know yet what
that love means, you know.

1563
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:43,686
Just 'cause it's so new,
and it's so exciting

1564
01:02:43,786 --> 01:02:44,856
that it's great.

1565
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,708
I don't know. We've only known each other

1566
01:02:47,808 --> 01:02:48,731
17 weeks, so it's...

1567
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,264
Okay.

1568
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:53,302
Honestly, I mean, I thought...

1569
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:55,963
I thought you felt weird
that we're having a baby

1570
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,596
and we're not engaged or anything.

1571
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:58,970
- I'm gonna get off my knee.
- Yeah.

1572
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,565
It's hurting a little bit.

1573
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:01,940
No, I'm okay with that.

1574
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,673
You know, we're just doing what we can.

1575
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,840
We're making the best of it,
and I don't want us

1576
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,389
to put any more pressure on ourselves

1577
01:03:08,489 --> 01:03:09,285
than we already have.

1578
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,977
Okay. Yeah.
That makes perfect sense.

1579
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:12,611
Are you okay? I don't want
to hurt your feelings.

1580
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,205
No, no, no.
Honestly, I just wanted

1581
01:03:14,305 --> 01:03:15,591
to do right by you, you know?

1582
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:18,558
So if you don't want to,
that's totally cool, you know?

1583
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:19,889
Okay.

1584
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:22,292
I really do love you.

1585
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,957
I know. Thanks.

1586
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:26,365
You mentioned that. It's nice.

1587
01:03:33,364 --> 01:03:35,161
Ben proposed to me.

1588
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,695
- What?
- He did.

1589
01:03:37,802 --> 01:03:39,642
It was really sweet.
I kind of feel

1590
01:03:39,742 --> 01:03:41,138
a little bit bad about it.

1591
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:43,570
He was, like, wearing
this great little button-down.

1592
01:03:43,674 --> 01:03:46,337
He tucked his shirt in.
He got down on one knee.

1593
01:03:46,437 --> 01:03:47,311
It was so sweet.

1594
01:03:47,411 --> 01:03:49,011
He didn't have an actual ring, though.

1595
01:03:49,111 --> 01:03:50,147
It was just an empty box.

1596
01:03:50,247 --> 01:03:51,906
But, you know,
he had this whole spiel

1597
01:03:52,006 --> 01:03:53,250
about when he has the money,

1598
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:56,513
he's gonna buy me
the ring that I deserve and...

1599
01:03:56,587 --> 01:03:58,487
The box was just empty?

1600
01:03:58,556 --> 01:04:00,717
I mean, he can't afford a ring, so...

1601
01:04:00,825 --> 01:04:03,919
So he got down on one knee
and gave you an empty box?

1602
01:04:04,028 --> 01:04:05,393
Yes.

1603
01:04:05,462 --> 01:04:06,986
I'm sorry.

1604
01:04:07,064 --> 01:04:09,055
Get over it. It was sweet.

1605
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:10,518
I'm telling you,
if you'd been there,

1606
01:04:10,618 --> 01:04:11,736
you would have probably cried.

1607
01:04:11,836 --> 01:04:13,736
- You need to train him.
- Huh?

1608
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:17,934
Oprah said that when two people meet,

1609
01:04:18,042 --> 01:04:20,619
they are forced to point out each other's

1610
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:22,079
differences and flaws.

1611
01:04:22,179 --> 01:04:24,335
I thought you were supposed
to just accept people for who

1612
01:04:24,435 --> 01:04:25,449
they are, love them anyway.

1613
01:04:25,549 --> 01:04:27,346
You criticize them a lot,

1614
01:04:27,418 --> 01:04:29,178
and then they get so down on themselves

1615
01:04:29,278 --> 01:04:30,621
that they're forced to change.

1616
01:04:30,721 --> 01:04:32,279
Really? You don't think
that would just make it worse?

1617
01:04:32,389 --> 01:04:33,515
That'd be, like, naggy.

1618
01:04:33,591 --> 01:04:36,025
And then in the end,
they thank you for it.

1619
01:04:36,894 --> 01:04:38,542
You can't commit to him. You can't make

1620
01:04:38,642 --> 01:04:39,463
a commitment to him.

1621
01:04:39,563 --> 01:04:42,432
You don't even know him.
I don't even know Pete

1622
01:04:42,532 --> 01:04:43,434
after 10 years.

1623
01:04:43,534 --> 01:04:45,729
- What?
- I don't know what he's up to.

1624
01:04:45,803 --> 01:04:47,202
He's miserable.

1625
01:04:47,271 --> 01:04:48,533
Why do you say that?

1626
01:04:48,606 --> 01:04:50,870
- I think he's cheating on me.
- What?

1627
01:04:50,941 --> 01:04:53,792
He's always going off
to these business meetings

1628
01:04:53,892 --> 01:04:54,645
at odd hours.

1629
01:04:54,745 --> 01:04:56,406
And then I try to call him on his cell phone,

1630
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,745
and he says that he's in bad
cell phone reception areas

1631
01:04:59,817 --> 01:05:02,217
when he's in good cell phone reception areas.

1632
01:05:02,286 --> 01:05:03,810
Maybe he's working late.

1633
01:05:03,921 --> 01:05:05,889
You know, I mean, maybe
he's just working really hard

1634
01:05:05,956 --> 01:05:07,821
to sign a new great band or something.

1635
01:05:07,925 --> 01:05:09,654
I can't imagine Pete doing something like that.

1636
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,446
There's no part of you that thinks that maybe

1637
01:05:12,546 --> 01:05:14,198
he's a dirty little scumbag?

1638
01:05:14,298 --> 01:05:16,198
No. Mmm-mmm.

1639
01:05:16,267 --> 01:05:17,666
I think he might be.

1640
01:05:18,669 --> 01:05:20,899
'Memory Spy,
web memory software.

1641
01:05:20,971 --> 01:05:23,462
'Locate history files,
websites visited,

1642
01:05:23,574 --> 01:05:27,738
'hidden downloads, searches,
email history. Memory Spy.'

1643
01:05:29,713 --> 01:05:32,147
Let's see you hide from me now, little man.

1644
01:05:40,724 --> 01:05:42,487
So you're not even gonna tell them?

1645
01:05:42,593 --> 01:05:44,959
No. You know,
I don't have to tell them.

1646
01:05:45,062 --> 01:05:47,997
It's illegal for them
to fire me over it anyway,

1647
01:05:48,098 --> 01:05:50,931
and I get three months
maternity leave if I stay,

1648
01:05:51,001 --> 01:05:53,299
so I'm just, you know,
not gonna tell them.

1649
01:05:53,404 --> 01:05:55,099
- That's a good plan.
- Yeah. I like it.

1650
01:05:55,172 --> 01:05:58,055
It is a good plan until
her water breaks all over

1651
01:05:58,155 --> 01:05:59,510
Robert De Niro's shoes.

1652
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:01,736
'My shoes!
Hey, there's all this

1653
01:06:01,836 --> 01:06:02,909
baby goo on it.'

1654
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:06,780
'These shoes? On these shoes?

1655
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:08,181
'Did you puke on my shoes?'

1656
01:06:08,285 --> 01:06:09,721
- 'Did your water break on my shoes?'

1657
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:10,855
'Did you puke on my shoes?'

1658
01:06:10,955 --> 01:06:12,286
Oh, my God.

1659
01:06:12,356 --> 01:06:13,905
Isn't it weird, though,
when you have a kid

1660
01:06:14,005 --> 01:06:15,059
and all your dreams and hopes

1661
01:06:15,159 --> 01:06:17,593
just go right out the window?

1662
01:06:17,661 --> 01:06:20,115
What changed for you?
What went out the window?

1663
01:06:20,215 --> 01:06:20,764
What plans?

1664
01:06:20,864 --> 01:06:22,764
You do everything exactly the same.

1665
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:24,630
No, I mean, I love what I'm doing. Like, say...

1666
01:06:24,702 --> 01:06:27,133
Okay, say, you know,
before you're married

1667
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,272
and have children,

1668
01:06:28,372 --> 01:06:30,363
you wanna go live in India for a year.

1669
01:06:30,474 --> 01:06:32,076
You can do it.
But you can't do it

1670
01:06:32,176 --> 01:06:33,277
once you have a family.

1671
01:06:33,377 --> 01:06:34,998
- You wanna go live in India?
- I don't wanna go

1672
01:06:35,098 --> 01:06:35,546
live in India.

1673
01:06:35,646 --> 01:06:38,260
Do you want to go to India?
Go to India! Seriously,

1674
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:38,949
go to India.

1675
01:06:39,049 --> 01:06:40,539
What about you?
Do you want to go to India?

1676
01:06:40,651 --> 01:06:42,710
I'm not going to India.
You can go to India.

1677
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:44,219
I get what he's talking about.

1678
01:06:44,321 --> 01:06:47,222
You know, honestly, like,
when I found out about...

1679
01:06:47,324 --> 01:06:53,490
I totally, like, I just had this flash
of me, like in a white Ford Bronco,

1680
01:06:53,564 --> 01:06:56,533
and I'm just hauling ass for Canada, man.

1681
01:06:56,633 --> 01:06:59,033
The chopper's taping
the whole thing, and I just...

1682
01:06:59,136 --> 01:07:01,229
I bust through the border and I'm a free man!

1683
01:07:01,338 --> 01:07:03,067
That's all I kept thinking, man.

1684
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,573
You know what I'm saying?
It was a flash!

1685
01:07:04,641 --> 01:07:05,905
Wait. What do you mean?
What are you...

1686
01:07:06,005 --> 01:07:06,543
Don't look at me.

1687
01:07:06,643 --> 01:07:07,849
We can talk about our fears here.

1688
01:07:07,949 --> 01:07:08,812
It's not like he did it.

1689
01:07:08,912 --> 01:07:11,405
I mean, honestly, like,
if Doc Brown screeched up

1690
01:07:11,505 --> 01:07:13,150
in front of you in the DeLorean.

1691
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:14,274
Open the door, he's like,

1692
01:07:14,351 --> 01:07:17,809
'Hey, Allison, Come on. I got
the car here. What do you wanna do?'

1693
01:07:17,888 --> 01:07:20,584
No part of your brain would have been,
like, 'You know, maybe we'll go back

1694
01:07:20,691 --> 01:07:24,183
'to that night and I would maybe
put a condom on Ben's dick.'

1695
01:07:25,362 --> 01:07:27,091
- You never got that flash?
- No.

1696
01:07:27,197 --> 01:07:29,324
And I don't know what you're talking about.

1697
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,733
'Where we're going,
we don't need roads.'

1698
01:07:32,836 --> 01:07:34,303
Exactly.
You wouldn't do that?

1699
01:07:34,371 --> 01:07:37,101
I don't know who Doc Brown is.

1700
01:07:37,174 --> 01:07:38,266
What are you talking about?

1701
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:40,502
Doc Brown is the guy who's Christopher Lloyd.

1702
01:07:40,577 --> 01:07:42,010
He invented the DeLorean,
the time machine.

1703
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,376
- He's the one who made the time machine.
- What?

1704
01:07:43,447 --> 01:07:46,416
It's the time machine.
Everyone has the time machine image.

1705
01:07:46,517 --> 01:07:49,680
Hey. I have a really good idea.

1706
01:07:49,753 --> 01:07:53,621
Why don't the two of you
get into your time machine,

1707
01:07:53,724 --> 01:07:56,693
go back in time and fuck each other?

1708
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,125
Who needs a time machine?

1709
01:07:58,195 --> 01:07:59,719
This is my time machine!

1710
01:07:59,797 --> 01:08:02,960
I'm gonna throw you
in my DeLorean, gun it to '88.

1711
01:08:06,203 --> 01:08:08,433
You are a funny motherfucker,
man. Jesus.

1712
01:08:08,539 --> 01:08:10,789
How can you fight with him?
Look at his face.

1713
01:08:10,889 --> 01:08:12,042
I just want to kiss it.

1714
01:08:12,142 --> 01:08:13,803
I think he's cute.

1715
01:08:13,911 --> 01:08:15,879
I like the way you move.

1716
01:08:17,948 --> 01:08:20,576
This is fun! We should do this more, I think.

1717
01:08:20,651 --> 01:08:23,611
I mean, this is, like,
the most fun I've had

1718
01:08:23,711 --> 01:08:25,201
in a really long time.

1719
01:08:31,061 --> 01:08:33,427
- Come on, harder.
- I can't do it harder.

1720
01:08:33,497 --> 01:08:36,432
Why? Come on.
Come on, just do it. Deeper.

1721
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,092
- I can't.
- Oh, why?

1722
01:08:38,168 --> 01:08:41,228
- I'll poke the baby if I go deeper.
- Oh, Come on! Just do it!

1723
01:08:41,305 --> 01:08:43,569
Please, don't yell at me,
please don't.

1724
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,507
What? The doctor and Debbie
said it's fine. Come on!

1725
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:48,771
Look, can we... I'm sorry,
can we change positions?

1726
01:08:48,846 --> 01:08:51,246
- What?
- I'm gonna crush the baby. I know it.

1727
01:08:51,315 --> 01:08:53,283
- This is ridiculous! Why are we...
- No, it's not.

1728
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:54,908
There's no shell in there,
you know?

1729
01:08:54,985 --> 01:08:57,180
Millions of people have sex
when they're pregnant!

1730
01:08:57,287 --> 01:08:59,619
I don't know how it works.
It just works, okay? Just do it.

1731
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:01,308
All I'm thinking of is that I'm gonna...

1732
01:09:01,408 --> 01:09:02,359
I weigh over 200 pounds.

1733
01:09:02,459 --> 01:09:05,656
- Just get over it!
- I can't do it. Can you just get on top?

1734
01:09:05,762 --> 01:09:09,254
All I see is our baby
getting poked in the face by my penis.

1735
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:10,857
- Trust me, you're not even close.
- Okay.

1736
01:09:10,968 --> 01:09:12,833
- Come on, fine.
- Okay, fine.

1737
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:17,134
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

1738
01:09:17,207 --> 01:09:19,334
- That's okay.
- Sorry.

1739
01:09:19,443 --> 01:09:21,377
Okay. Oh, good.

1740
01:09:21,445 --> 01:09:23,743
I can't. I can't.

1741
01:09:23,814 --> 01:09:25,865
I can't. I can't do this,
I just... I can't. I can't.

1742
01:09:25,965 --> 01:09:26,884
I can't focus like this.

1743
01:09:26,984 --> 01:09:28,790
I look disgusting from this angle. I can feel

1744
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:29,953
you looking up at my chins.

1745
01:09:30,053 --> 01:09:31,953
- I know I look gross.
- No, you look beautiful.

1746
01:09:32,022 --> 01:09:33,182
Your chin looks so skinny.

1747
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:34,933
And my boobs are all,
like, squishy, and they're

1748
01:09:35,033 --> 01:09:35,559
flopping around.

1749
01:09:35,659 --> 01:09:37,820
- I can feel it, and it's distracting.
- No...

1750
01:09:37,895 --> 01:09:39,362
It's all National Geographic.

1751
01:09:39,463 --> 01:09:42,227
Okay. Can we do...
Do you wanna do doggie style?

1752
01:09:42,332 --> 01:09:45,529
No. I do not want you to fuck me like a dog.

1753
01:09:45,636 --> 01:09:48,662
I'm not fucking you
like a dog. It's doggie style.

1754
01:09:48,739 --> 01:09:51,640
It's just the style.
It's not...

1755
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:53,968
It's not like a dog.
We don't have

1756
01:09:54,068 --> 01:09:55,838
to go outside or anything.

1757
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,372
- Here we go. Okay.
- Okay.

1758
01:10:00,484 --> 01:10:01,678
- Okay, is it good?
- Yeah.

1759
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:03,548
- Should I go slower?
- Yeah, no, that's good.

1760
01:10:03,654 --> 01:10:04,951
- Okay, faster?
- Harder.

1761
01:10:05,022 --> 01:10:06,546
- Just tell me when you're close.
- Just go harder.

1762
01:10:06,657 --> 01:10:09,148
- Okay.
- Keep going!

1763
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,993
Oh, God.

1764
01:10:11,061 --> 01:10:12,528
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

1765
01:10:12,629 --> 01:10:13,823
- What happened?
- Oh, my God.

1766
01:10:13,897 --> 01:10:16,297
- The baby, it kicked my hand.
- Well, no, no, it always kicks.

1767
01:10:16,366 --> 01:10:19,028
- No, no, no. Not like this.
- No, it's fine. It's fine. Just keep going.

1768
01:10:19,136 --> 01:10:20,569
It was a warning kick.
This was a bad kick.

1769
01:10:20,637 --> 01:10:22,571
No, no, it's fine.
It's fine! It's fine!

1770
01:10:22,673 --> 01:10:25,073
Look, my dick must be like
an inch away from its face,

1771
01:10:25,175 --> 01:10:27,040
- and it's coming, just coming in at its face.
- Oh, shit.

1772
01:10:27,144 --> 01:10:28,805
What if it kicked 'cause it didn't like it?

1773
01:10:28,879 --> 01:10:32,337
I can't do that to our baby.
That's the first thing it's gonna see.

1774
01:10:32,416 --> 01:10:33,974
What are you talking about?

1775
01:10:34,051 --> 01:10:36,178
It's having the baby between,

1776
01:10:36,253 --> 01:10:38,005
you know, us,
it just makes it weird.

1777
01:10:38,105 --> 01:10:38,555
I'm sorry.

1778
01:10:38,655 --> 01:10:40,350
It just freaks me out a bit.
It's a little weird.

1779
01:10:40,424 --> 01:10:41,652
I have totally lost it.

1780
01:10:41,725 --> 01:10:43,818
- You've totally lost it?
- I've lost it.

1781
01:10:43,894 --> 01:10:45,054
Okay.

1782
01:10:45,162 --> 01:10:46,459
Great, you know what?
Just forget it.

1783
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:49,021
Okay. Okay, fine.

1784
01:10:50,601 --> 01:10:53,365
Don't worry. I won't make you do this again.

1785
01:10:53,437 --> 01:10:54,699
Shit.

1786
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,910
Fuck me!

1787
01:11:12,022 --> 01:11:14,013
Oh, my God. It's the Russians!

1788
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:18,957
- Jodi, I'll protect you!
- Oh, man!

1789
01:11:19,129 --> 01:11:20,289
Ben!

1790
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:23,063
Oh, my God.

1791
01:11:23,133 --> 01:11:25,761
Oh, God. Oh, no!

1792
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:28,269
Oh, God, that was horrible!
That was so horrible!

1793
01:11:28,372 --> 01:11:29,896
When will it be light out?

1794
01:11:29,973 --> 01:11:31,634
Okay, you're fine, man.
Take it easy.

1795
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,767
- Hey, did anybody turn off the gas?
- I didn't do it.

1796
01:11:33,877 --> 01:11:35,276
Oh, motherfucker.

1797
01:11:35,979 --> 01:11:37,241
- Hey, Marty.
- Yeah.

1798
01:11:37,314 --> 01:11:38,872
This is my friend, Alex.
She's a pretty

1799
01:11:38,972 --> 01:11:39,683
incredible person.

1800
01:11:39,783 --> 01:11:41,808
Okay. Nice to meet you.

1801
01:11:42,552 --> 01:11:45,248
Whoa, dude! Not cool, Martin.

1802
01:11:45,922 --> 01:11:47,321
That's... That wasn't...

1803
01:11:47,424 --> 01:11:48,914
Hey, are you serious,
Howard Hughes?

1804
01:11:48,992 --> 01:11:51,620
- What happened?
- Nothing. Nothing happened.

1805
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:53,958
- Come on.
- Where were you?

1806
01:11:54,064 --> 01:11:55,869
Look, I forgot you were sleeping over.

1807
01:11:55,969 --> 01:11:56,700
I'm sorry, okay?

1808
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,735
Yeah, 'cause you're getting
high off your huge bong.

1809
01:11:59,803 --> 01:12:00,929
How am I supposed to be comfortable

1810
01:12:01,004 --> 01:12:02,869
with the idea that you can
take care of me and the baby

1811
01:12:02,939 --> 01:12:05,169
if you are always getting high?

1812
01:12:05,242 --> 01:12:06,607
You want me to stop smoking pot

1813
01:12:06,677 --> 01:12:08,736
'cause there's an earthquake
once every 10 years?

1814
01:12:08,812 --> 01:12:12,304
That makes no sense, Allison.
Look, you're being irrational.

1815
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:14,741
Just relax, okay?
We're all scared, you know?

1816
01:12:14,841 --> 01:12:15,385
You just...

1817
01:12:15,485 --> 01:12:17,248
Oh, shit, the cops.

1818
01:12:19,423 --> 01:12:21,186
California, eh?

1819
01:12:39,876 --> 01:12:44,506
You know, it's times like this
I'm glad I don't own nice things.

1820
01:12:44,614 --> 01:12:46,066
It's a big mess,
but there's only like

1821
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:47,050
$50 worth of shit here.

1822
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:49,118
And that's kind of the good thing.

1823
01:12:49,186 --> 01:12:51,450
You know, my dad told me,
'Don't move to Northridge.'

1824
01:12:51,521 --> 01:12:53,913
But you figure, like, what are
the chances of that happening

1825
01:12:54,013 --> 01:12:54,625
twice, you know?

1826
01:12:54,725 --> 01:12:55,953
What is this?

1827
01:12:56,026 --> 01:12:57,391
It's a ninja weapon.

1828
01:12:59,229 --> 01:13:01,979
I hope this place doesn't get condemned.

1829
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:03,149
That would suck.

1830
01:13:42,072 --> 01:13:43,903
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

1831
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:46,942
- You!
- Hi. So, listen.

1832
01:13:47,677 --> 01:13:48,701
Will you do me a big favor?

1833
01:13:48,779 --> 01:13:50,542
Debbie wants us to come over
and have dinner tonight.

1834
01:13:50,614 --> 01:13:52,343
She thinks Pete is cheating on her.

1835
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:54,179
- Really?
- Yeah.

1836
01:13:54,251 --> 01:13:55,912
Well, she saw one of his emails and...

1837
01:13:56,019 --> 01:13:58,010
- Oh, man.
- There's an address.

1838
01:13:58,088 --> 01:13:59,783
That sounds terrible.
I don't want to do that.

1839
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:01,482
Ben, Come on.

1840
01:14:01,558 --> 01:14:02,855
He's not cheating on her.

1841
01:14:02,926 --> 01:14:04,621
- How do you know?
- I just know.

1842
01:14:04,728 --> 01:14:07,094
- Are you sure?
- I'm 100% sure he's not cheating.

1843
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:08,630
Are you really?

1844
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:10,292
No.

1845
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:12,062
It actually kind of makes sense
that he would cheat.

1846
01:14:12,135 --> 01:14:13,227
Why?

1847
01:14:13,303 --> 01:14:15,794
'Cause Debbie's a pain in the ass
and Pete's awesome.

1848
01:14:15,906 --> 01:14:18,859
Why don't you just come over
then, and we'll just diffuse

1849
01:14:18,959 --> 01:14:20,143
the situation a little.

1850
01:14:20,243 --> 01:14:22,541
I'm just saying the music industry
is different now.

1851
01:14:22,612 --> 01:14:25,604
You can't...
Steely Dan would never even have a chance.

1852
01:14:25,715 --> 01:14:28,582
Well, maybe it's 'cause
Steely Dan gargles my balls.

1853
01:14:28,685 --> 01:14:30,448
- They're incredible.
- They really aren't good, man.

1854
01:14:30,554 --> 01:14:31,680
Old Steely Dan.

1855
01:14:31,755 --> 01:14:33,120
If I ever listen to Steely Dan,

1856
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:35,590
I want you to slice my head
off with an Al Jarreau LP.

1857
01:14:38,528 --> 01:14:39,859
Oh, I should get going.

1858
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:42,524
I'm supposed to see this
band tonight in Hollywood.

1859
01:14:42,599 --> 01:14:44,260
Actually, they're playing in Laurel Canyon,

1860
01:14:44,367 --> 01:14:46,498
so I'll call you 'cause
the reception's terrible

1861
01:14:46,598 --> 01:14:47,337
over there, so...

1862
01:14:47,437 --> 01:14:48,563
Okay.

1863
01:14:48,638 --> 01:14:51,266
And I don't want you to worry
'cause I know you worry.

1864
01:14:51,374 --> 01:14:52,602
I'm just gonna jump in the shower.

1865
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:55,644
It would be terrible if I smelled
worse than the band.

1866
01:14:55,745 --> 01:14:58,145
Okay. Have fun.

1867
01:14:58,215 --> 01:14:59,546
All right.

1868
01:15:01,051 --> 01:15:04,203
You guys are crazy.
He's acting totally normal

1869
01:15:04,303 --> 01:15:05,249
and hilarious.

1870
01:15:17,968 --> 01:15:20,232
She doesn't have a gun,
does she?

1871
01:15:20,303 --> 01:15:22,294
No. I don't think so.

1872
01:15:36,786 --> 01:15:38,151
Looks like no one's home.

1873
01:15:38,221 --> 01:15:40,382
Why was the door unlocked?

1874
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:41,856
Wait here.

1875
01:15:54,971 --> 01:15:57,166
I kind of feel bad for Pete.

1876
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,468
What?

1877
01:15:58,775 --> 01:16:00,766
This isn't a good way,
you know.

1878
01:16:00,844 --> 01:16:02,693
If you're gonna get caught cheating,

1879
01:16:02,793 --> 01:16:04,114
it shouldn't be like this.

1880
01:16:04,214 --> 01:16:06,494
Well, maybe he should've thought of that

1881
01:16:06,594 --> 01:16:07,884
before he was cheating.

1882
01:16:07,984 --> 01:16:09,508
- Pete!
- Stop it.

1883
01:16:09,619 --> 01:16:12,315
I coughed.
What do you want from me?

1884
01:16:12,389 --> 01:16:14,687
There's nobody up there.

1885
01:16:14,758 --> 01:16:15,918
Thank you.

1886
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,259
I guess I was wrong.

1887
01:16:18,328 --> 01:16:19,420
I told you.

1888
01:16:19,496 --> 01:16:21,726
- Can we get out of here, please?
- Yeah, Come on. Let's go.

1889
01:16:21,798 --> 01:16:23,891
Suck it!
Did you hear that?

1890
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,332
- What?
- I didn't hear anything.

1891
01:16:43,253 --> 01:16:44,914
- Carlos Delgado.
- Excellent choice.

1892
01:16:45,021 --> 01:16:47,319
Too bad I got him three rounds ago.
You're still on the clock.

1893
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:49,187
- Oh, shit!
- You gotta do something.

1894
01:16:49,259 --> 01:16:50,988
We need a name.

1895
01:16:51,061 --> 01:16:52,358
Hideki Matsui.

1896
01:16:52,429 --> 01:16:54,727
- You just took my whole outfield.
- Sorry, Charlie.

1897
01:16:54,831 --> 01:16:56,423
What is this?

1898
01:16:56,499 --> 01:16:57,830
Debbie.

1899
01:16:57,901 --> 01:17:00,096
What the fuck is this?

1900
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:01,967
It's our fantasy baseball draft.

1901
01:17:02,038 --> 01:17:03,471
We said no wives.

1902
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:04,939
Your fantasy what?

1903
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:08,739
It's our draft for fantasy baseball.

1904
01:17:08,845 --> 01:17:11,075
I told you all about this.

1905
01:17:11,181 --> 01:17:12,580
Got Matsui.

1906
01:17:15,619 --> 01:17:16,677
Shit!

1907
01:17:17,554 --> 01:17:19,169
Hey, Pete, don't let the door hit you

1908
01:17:19,269 --> 01:17:20,524
in the vagina on the way out!

1909
01:17:20,624 --> 01:17:22,785
- Come on, who's going?
- Prince, you're on the clock.

1910
01:17:23,059 --> 01:17:24,856
I should have told you.

1911
01:17:24,961 --> 01:17:27,452
- What else have you been lying about?
- Nothing...

1912
01:17:27,564 --> 01:17:28,588
That guy said,

1913
01:17:28,698 --> 01:17:31,496
'Don't let the door hit you
in the vagina on the way out.'

1914
01:17:31,568 --> 01:17:33,229
Yeah, I heard him.

1915
01:17:33,303 --> 01:17:34,861
That was hilarious.

1916
01:17:34,938 --> 01:17:36,814
It's just that I know you've
been mad 'cause I've

1917
01:17:36,914 --> 01:17:37,707
been working so much,

1918
01:17:37,807 --> 01:17:39,297
and I didn't want to upset you.

1919
01:17:39,409 --> 01:17:41,707
I wouldn't be mad.
I don't get mad.

1920
01:17:41,778 --> 01:17:45,111
It's a fantasy baseball draft.
I'm not cheating or anything.

1921
01:17:45,215 --> 01:17:47,046
No, this is worse.

1922
01:17:47,117 --> 01:17:48,607
How is this worse?

1923
01:17:48,718 --> 01:17:51,678
This is you wanting to be with your friends

1924
01:17:51,778 --> 01:17:53,268
more than your family.

1925
01:17:53,323 --> 01:17:55,427
Look, the reason I make
that up is because if I told

1926
01:17:55,527 --> 01:17:56,660
you what I was really doing,

1927
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,318
you would just get mad.

1928
01:17:58,428 --> 01:18:02,088
So you think I'm seeing
a band, I do my fantasy draft,

1929
01:18:02,188 --> 01:18:03,328
and it's win-win.

1930
01:18:04,067 --> 01:18:06,740
Well, what'd you do last
Wednesday night when you said

1931
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:07,971
you went to see a band?

1932
01:18:08,071 --> 01:18:09,333
I went to the movies.

1933
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:11,498
- With who?
- By myself.

1934
01:18:11,608 --> 01:18:13,200
What'd you see?

1935
01:18:13,276 --> 01:18:14,709
Spider-Man 3.

1936
01:18:14,778 --> 01:18:17,440
Why do you want to go by yourself?
Why didn't you ask me to go?

1937
01:18:17,514 --> 01:18:18,981
Because I needed to get away, you know.

1938
01:18:19,082 --> 01:18:21,079
With work and you
and the kids, sometimes I just

1939
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:22,218
need some time to myself.

1940
01:18:22,318 --> 01:18:25,412
I need time for myself.
I want time for myself, too.

1941
01:18:25,488 --> 01:18:27,422
You're not the only one.

1942
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:29,515
It's not that big of a deal.

1943
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:33,156
I like Spider-Man.

1944
01:18:33,263 --> 01:18:35,493
Okay, so let's see Spider-Man 3 next week.

1945
01:18:35,598 --> 01:18:38,089
I don't wanna go see it now.

1946
01:18:38,168 --> 01:18:41,103
I don't wanna have to ask you to ask me.

1947
01:18:41,171 --> 01:18:44,368
I want you to just come up with it on your own.

1948
01:18:44,474 --> 01:18:47,102
I don't even know what to say.
What do you want me to do?

1949
01:18:47,177 --> 01:18:50,498
You just think because
you don't yell that you're

1950
01:18:50,598 --> 01:18:52,444
not mean, but this is mean.

1951
01:18:53,516 --> 01:18:55,347
I'm not being mean.
I'm being honest.

1952
01:18:55,418 --> 01:18:56,783
You're telling me I need to be honest.

1953
01:18:56,853 --> 01:18:58,787
No, you're not. You're lying.

1954
01:18:58,855 --> 01:19:02,757
I'm doing it because I need to
keep my sanity a little bit.

1955
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,210
You know what?
I don't want you

1956
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:08,150
at the house anymore, okay?

1957
01:19:09,332 --> 01:19:10,629
Come on.

1958
01:19:12,102 --> 01:19:14,127
Shit, she's coming back.

1959
01:19:15,605 --> 01:19:17,664
How come we go to the gynecologist so often?

1960
01:19:17,774 --> 01:19:20,501
I bet we have to go so much
so we can pay for that

1961
01:19:20,601 --> 01:19:21,911
$300,000 machine he has.

1962
01:19:22,011 --> 01:19:27,381
I cannot stop thinking
about what an asshole Pete is.

1963
01:19:29,486 --> 01:19:31,784
That's a little strong,
I would say.

1964
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:32,947
Really?

1965
01:19:33,022 --> 01:19:35,873
'Cause that had to be
one of the most selfish things

1966
01:19:35,973 --> 01:19:37,060
I've ever witnessed.

1967
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,620
It's understandable,
I would say. I even think

1968
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:40,730
it's kind of funny.

1969
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:42,525
What's funny about it?

1970
01:19:42,632 --> 01:19:44,964
Well, you won't laugh now,
I wouldn't imagine,

1971
01:19:45,034 --> 01:19:48,128
but, you know, the situation.

1972
01:19:48,204 --> 01:19:50,399
We break into this stranger's house

1973
01:19:50,507 --> 01:19:53,670
thinking we're gonna find him
sleeping with a woman,

1974
01:19:53,743 --> 01:19:56,371
and it's a bunch of nerds
playing fantasy baseball.

1975
01:19:56,479 --> 01:19:58,845
If you saw that, like,
on television, you would laugh.

1976
01:19:58,915 --> 01:20:02,043
Is that what you think?
Is that what you wanna do, Ben?

1977
01:20:02,152 --> 01:20:04,552
I don't even like baseball.

1978
01:20:04,654 --> 01:20:06,698
I'm just saying,
when you're a guy and,

1979
01:20:06,798 --> 01:20:08,291
you know, you have a family,

1980
01:20:08,391 --> 01:20:10,882
you have responsibility,
you lose that male camaraderie.

1981
01:20:10,994 --> 01:20:13,118
And I get that.
I totally understand

1982
01:20:13,218 --> 01:20:14,597
where he's coming from.

1983
01:20:14,697 --> 01:20:16,096
Why do guys always go to that place?

1984
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:18,258
'We miss male camaraderie.'
Why do I give a shit?

1985
01:20:18,368 --> 01:20:21,360
Go hang out with your bearded
freak friends. I don't care.

1986
01:20:21,437 --> 01:20:23,387
You wanna hang out with guys
that look like the shoe

1987
01:20:23,487 --> 01:20:24,574
bomber, it's all on you, man.

1988
01:20:24,674 --> 01:20:26,232
What the fuck am I supposed to say to that?

1989
01:20:26,342 --> 01:20:27,400
You should just support me!

1990
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:29,910
You know, you should just
support everything I say

1991
01:20:30,013 --> 01:20:32,573
because at this juncture in my life,
I'm allowed to be wrong!

1992
01:20:32,682 --> 01:20:34,240
- So if you're wrong, I have to support it?
- Yes!

1993
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:36,341
I can't tell you that
you're acting like a lunatic?

1994
01:20:36,419 --> 01:20:37,784
- No.
- No? Okay.

1995
01:20:37,887 --> 01:20:40,014
That's helpful.
You have to do nothing!

1996
01:20:40,089 --> 01:20:42,250
I've sacrificed a lot of shit to do this!

1997
01:20:42,358 --> 01:20:43,595
You haven't sacrificed anything!

1998
01:20:43,695 --> 01:20:43,927
I have.

1999
01:20:44,027 --> 01:20:48,396
I've had to sacrifice my job,
my body, my youth, my vagina!

2000
01:20:48,464 --> 01:20:49,761
You've sacrificed your vagina?

2001
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:52,666
Yes! It will never look the same after this!

2002
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:57,160
Well. Fine. I'm sorry,
I'll pay for vaginal

2003
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:58,820
reconstructive surgery.

2004
01:20:58,908 --> 01:21:01,274
You can't pay for shit!
You can barely buy spaghetti!

2005
01:21:01,377 --> 01:21:03,743
You're right! Fine! Okay.

2006
01:21:03,813 --> 01:21:06,008
You know what?
Get out of the car.

2007
01:21:06,082 --> 01:21:07,845
You know what? How...

2008
01:21:07,917 --> 01:21:09,145
Why don't you not threaten me?

2009
01:21:09,252 --> 01:21:11,243
You should just get out of the fucking car.

2010
01:21:11,321 --> 01:21:13,551
I'm not gonna get out of the car
in the middle of nowhere! No!

2011
01:21:13,623 --> 01:21:14,715
- Get out of the car!
- No.

2012
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:17,225
- I own this car! Get out of my car!
- No.

2013
01:21:17,293 --> 01:21:18,419
- Get out of my car!
- No.

2014
01:21:18,494 --> 01:21:20,621
Get out of my fucking car!

2015
01:21:32,108 --> 01:21:34,804
Can you let me back in the car, please?

2016
01:21:34,911 --> 01:21:37,903
Have you calmed down?
Did you take a breath?

2017
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,580
I have no clue where we are!

2018
01:21:43,853 --> 01:21:45,252
Fine. Go.

2019
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,657
Great.

2020
01:22:09,779 --> 01:22:11,041
Okay.

2021
01:22:11,147 --> 01:22:13,934
Maybe I should take my shoes off. Or my belt

2022
01:22:14,034 --> 01:22:15,919
buckle, my belt buckle's huge.

2023
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:17,384
Don't worry about gaining weight.

2024
01:22:17,487 --> 01:22:20,479
Your baby wants you to gain
a whole mess of weight.

2025
01:22:20,556 --> 01:22:21,784
Are you fucking kidding me?

2026
01:22:21,858 --> 01:22:23,270
Why don't you take off your earrings, too?

2027
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:24,260
They weigh about 80 pounds.

2028
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,452
They're made out of moon rocks,
aren't they?

2029
01:22:25,528 --> 01:22:28,326
Do not make fun of me.
Okay? I am hormonal.

2030
01:22:28,398 --> 01:22:30,662
I am terrified,
and I am falling apart,

2031
01:22:30,733 --> 01:22:33,065
so stop treating everything
like it's a big joke!

2032
01:22:33,169 --> 01:22:34,534
Okay, I'm sorry you're freaking out,

2033
01:22:34,637 --> 01:22:37,902
but I just walked three fucking miles through
Koreatown to get here!

2034
01:22:38,007 --> 01:22:39,907
Sorry if I'm trying
to lighten the mood a little.

2035
01:22:40,009 --> 01:22:41,135
Well, don't, okay?

2036
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:43,144
You can't take anything seriously!

2037
01:22:43,212 --> 01:22:44,975
You know, you didn't even read the baby books.

2038
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:47,915
I didn't read the baby book!
What's gonna happen?

2039
01:22:48,017 --> 01:22:50,850
How did anyone ever give birth
without a baby book?

2040
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:54,014
That's right. The ancient
Egyptians fucking engraved

2041
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:55,599
What to Expect When You're Expecting

2042
01:22:55,699 --> 01:22:56,559
on the pyramid walls!

2043
01:22:56,659 --> 01:22:58,058
I forgot about that!

2044
01:22:58,161 --> 01:23:00,891
Who gives a flying fuck about the baby books?

2045
01:23:00,997 --> 01:23:03,363
It just shows your lack of commitment, Ben!

2046
01:23:03,433 --> 01:23:05,901
That you're not in this with me!

2047
01:23:06,002 --> 01:23:08,043
Did you just say 'my lack
of commitment'? 'Cause

2048
01:23:08,143 --> 01:23:09,339
that's what it sounded like.

2049
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:12,808
It almost seems as though you forgot I proposed

2050
01:23:12,908 --> 01:23:14,604
to you, like an asshole!

2051
01:23:14,711 --> 01:23:16,542
And you said no to me!

2052
01:23:16,612 --> 01:23:18,705
If you feel that way,
you should just go.

2053
01:23:18,781 --> 01:23:20,271
Really. Just go.

2054
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:23,080
Because we didn't mean
to do this together, okay?

2055
01:23:23,186 --> 01:23:25,380
And... And we tried to make it work

2056
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:27,290
and that was good, I suppose.

2057
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:28,948
But it doesn't work.

2058
01:23:29,058 --> 01:23:31,390
Because we are two completely different people.

2059
01:23:31,461 --> 01:23:33,654
And I think it would just be
easier for both of us

2060
01:23:33,754 --> 01:23:35,031
if we stop fooling ourselves.

2061
01:23:35,131 --> 01:23:36,665
You know, I know this isn't you talking,

2062
01:23:36,765 --> 01:23:37,467
it's your hormones,

2063
01:23:37,567 --> 01:23:40,730
but I would just like to say,
fuck you, hormones!

2064
01:23:40,837 --> 01:23:43,455
You are a crazy bitch,
hormones.

2065
01:23:43,555 --> 01:23:45,399
Not Allison! Hormones!

2066
01:23:45,508 --> 01:23:48,705
Fuck them! It's a girl!
Buy some pink shit!

2067
01:23:48,778 --> 01:23:51,008
Nice. You are such an asshole.

2068
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:54,277
You know what?
Go fuck your fucking bong, you fuck!

2069
01:23:54,384 --> 01:23:57,512
I will fuck my bong.
Doggie style, for once.

2070
01:24:01,791 --> 01:24:03,418
Are you ready?

2071
01:24:06,729 --> 01:24:08,959
I'm really sorry about all that.
That was really inappropriate.

2072
01:24:09,065 --> 01:24:11,066
Oh, no, that's okay.
It happens all the time here.

2073
01:24:11,166 --> 01:24:11,534
It's fine.

2074
01:24:11,634 --> 01:24:14,125
- Oh, good, okay, I don't feel so stupid, then.
- No, no, not at all.

2075
01:24:15,772 --> 01:24:17,069
I totally know what you're talking about, man.

2076
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:19,759
Like, if I wrote out the list of shit Allison

2077
01:24:19,859 --> 01:24:20,877
doesn't let me do,

2078
01:24:20,977 --> 01:24:23,784
like, it would be endless.
'Don't smoke pot. Don't have

2079
01:24:23,884 --> 01:24:25,315
samurai swords in your room.

2080
01:24:25,415 --> 01:24:27,883
'Don't have illegal grow
operations in the house.'

2081
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:30,077
I mean, like,
I could go on all fucking day.

2082
01:24:30,153 --> 01:24:33,748
Have I told her to stop
doing anything ever? No.

2083
01:24:33,823 --> 01:24:35,654
Marriage is like that show,
Everybody Loves Raymond,

2084
01:24:35,758 --> 01:24:37,248
but it's not funny.

2085
01:24:37,326 --> 01:24:40,056
All the problems are the same,
but it's...

2086
01:24:40,129 --> 01:24:42,427
You know, instead of
all the funny, pithy dialog,

2087
01:24:42,498 --> 01:24:45,899
everybody's just really pissed off and tense.

2088
01:24:45,968 --> 01:24:48,998
Marriage is like an unfunny,
tense version of

2089
01:24:49,098 --> 01:24:50,728
Everybody Loves Raymond.

2090
01:24:50,773 --> 01:24:53,241
But it doesn't last 22 minutes.

2091
01:24:54,343 --> 01:24:56,106
It lasts forever.

2092
01:24:57,413 --> 01:25:01,281
Let's get out of here, man.
Honestly, like, let's just go.

2093
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:03,341
- Let's go to Vegas.
- Let's do it.

2094
01:25:03,453 --> 01:25:04,852
- Yeah.
- Why not?

2095
01:25:10,827 --> 01:25:12,021
- Get up.
- What?

2096
01:25:12,128 --> 01:25:13,254
- We're not gonna do this.
- What?

2097
01:25:13,329 --> 01:25:14,591
Seriously.

2098
01:25:16,966 --> 01:25:18,058
What are you doing?

2099
01:25:18,134 --> 01:25:21,729
We have to go do something and have fun!

2100
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:24,233
I'm just so tired.

2101
01:25:24,307 --> 01:25:25,569
I know you're tired.

2102
01:25:25,641 --> 01:25:29,008
But we're gonna be untired!
We're gonna go live!

2103
01:25:30,213 --> 01:25:32,477
I hate you so much sometimes.

2104
01:25:32,548 --> 01:25:33,913
We're gonna be positive.

2105
01:25:33,983 --> 01:25:36,645
Positive, positive, positive! Up!

2106
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:38,118
How many Red Bulls have you had?

2107
01:25:38,187 --> 01:25:41,122
I've had about three Red Bulls
in the last 15 minutes.

2108
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:42,714
And I feel fabulous!

2109
01:25:42,825 --> 01:25:46,693
We're gonna create a new life
and it's gonna be awesome!

2110
01:25:46,796 --> 01:25:48,730
Get up! Let's go!

2111
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:53,391
Since when do we lock
this fucking thing? Come on!

2112
01:25:58,374 --> 01:26:00,205
We can't go, dude. Sorry.

2113
01:26:00,276 --> 01:26:02,471
Holy crap! What happened?

2114
01:26:02,545 --> 01:26:04,206
We got pink eye.

2115
01:26:04,313 --> 01:26:06,281
What, you giving each other
butterfly kisses or something?

2116
01:26:06,349 --> 01:26:08,510
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny.
That's not how you get pink eye.

2117
01:26:08,584 --> 01:26:10,752
You get it from poo particles making their way

2118
01:26:10,852 --> 01:26:12,055
into your ocular cavities.

2119
01:26:12,155 --> 01:26:14,749
Hey, Ben. How's it going?
Yo.

2120
01:26:14,857 --> 01:26:17,553
I farted on Jason's pillow as a practical joke.

2121
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:19,787
He farted on Jonah's,
thinking it was mine,

2122
01:26:19,862 --> 01:26:23,593
and then eventually pink-eyed my pillow.

2123
01:26:23,666 --> 01:26:27,116
I'm not proud of any of this,
but I think we've all

2124
01:26:27,216 --> 01:26:28,566
forgiven each other.

2125
01:26:29,372 --> 01:26:30,703
But we can't go anywhere.

2126
01:26:30,773 --> 01:26:33,071
You can get pink eye from farting in a pillow?

2127
01:26:33,176 --> 01:26:34,438
- Totally.
- Mmm-hmm.

2128
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:35,841
That's awesome!

2129
01:26:35,912 --> 01:26:37,743
Yeah, but you got to be bare-assed.

2130
01:26:37,847 --> 01:26:39,246
Jesus, Martin got it bad!

2131
01:26:39,348 --> 01:26:41,578
What, did someone take a dump
right in your eye?

2132
01:26:41,684 --> 01:26:44,585
No. No pink eye for me.

2133
01:26:45,555 --> 01:26:48,524
I'm just really high.

2134
01:26:49,425 --> 01:26:52,690
Well, stay back, guys.
I got to get my suit, okay?

2135
01:26:54,463 --> 01:26:55,691
Fuck you.

2136
01:26:58,134 --> 01:26:59,761
Are you Debbie's husband?

2137
01:26:59,835 --> 01:27:00,460
Yeah.

2138
01:27:05,041 --> 01:27:06,736
- This is fun!
- This is great.

2139
01:27:06,809 --> 01:27:08,936
- It's just fun, man.
- We're gonna have the best time ever.

2140
01:27:09,045 --> 01:27:11,240
- We make a good team, man.
- Yeah.

2141
01:27:11,314 --> 01:27:13,373
It's like, I can't come here with Debbie.

2142
01:27:13,449 --> 01:27:15,474
She wouldn't understand it.
She doesn't understand.

2143
01:27:15,585 --> 01:27:17,476
She wants to hold me in,
and she was telling Allison

2144
01:27:17,576 --> 01:27:18,287
she could train you.

2145
01:27:18,387 --> 01:27:19,649
She thinks she could train me?

2146
01:27:19,755 --> 01:27:21,245
Yeah, like you're running the Triple Crown.

2147
01:27:21,324 --> 01:27:24,316
She can't train this!
I'm like Siegfried and Roy's Bengal.

2148
01:27:24,427 --> 01:27:26,327
You think I'm trained. I'll...

2149
01:27:26,429 --> 01:27:28,397
- I'll bite your fucking face off!
- That's right.

2150
01:27:28,464 --> 01:27:29,897
In front of a crowd, baby.

2151
01:27:29,966 --> 01:27:32,461
This is better. Besides,
I don't know if I have enough

2152
01:27:32,561 --> 01:27:33,903
of these babies to go around.

2153
01:27:34,003 --> 01:27:35,436
My God! Are these mushrooms?

2154
01:27:35,504 --> 01:27:36,994
Uh-huh. I got them from
a roadie for the Black Crowes.

2155
01:27:37,106 --> 01:27:38,164
I'm eating them.

2156
01:27:38,274 --> 01:27:39,865
No, no, no. Save it!
I got tickets

2157
01:27:39,965 --> 01:27:40,910
to Cirque du Soleil.

2158
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:42,773
You do? No, you don't.

2159
01:27:42,845 --> 01:27:44,142
I swear to God, man.

2160
01:27:44,247 --> 01:27:46,181
Holy shit!

2161
01:27:46,282 --> 01:27:47,909
See? I see the beam of light.

2162
01:27:47,984 --> 01:27:50,282
There it is, baby! Whoo-hoo!

2163
01:27:50,353 --> 01:27:51,909
You're so money that you don't even know

2164
01:27:52,009 --> 01:27:52,922
how much money you have.

2165
01:27:53,022 --> 01:27:55,855
You're money, baby!
You're money!

2166
01:28:00,463 --> 01:28:02,431
I love Vegas, man.

2167
01:28:03,099 --> 01:28:04,293
This is the greatest place on Earth.

2168
01:28:04,367 --> 01:28:07,461
It's really amazing here.
You got my tie!

2169
01:28:08,504 --> 01:28:10,233
This is awesome!

2170
01:28:12,675 --> 01:28:15,143
Now, that's how you get pink eye.

2171
01:28:21,784 --> 01:28:24,685
Hey, what's up? Baby girl.

2172
01:28:24,787 --> 01:28:26,049
Hi.

2173
01:28:26,122 --> 01:28:28,283
What's up?
End of the line, please.

2174
01:28:28,858 --> 01:28:30,587
- Really?
- Yeah.

2175
01:28:31,861 --> 01:28:33,624
Oh, Come on.

2176
01:28:33,696 --> 01:28:35,994
Look, we're at capacity, okay?

2177
01:28:36,098 --> 01:28:37,929
We'll let some people in
when it clears out a little.

2178
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,299
You'll get right in if you go
back to the end of the line.

2179
01:28:41,370 --> 01:28:43,304
We come here all the time.
It's not a big deal.

2180
01:28:43,372 --> 01:28:45,203
It doesn't really look that crowded in there.

2181
01:28:45,308 --> 01:28:47,208
Hey, look.
I don't make the rules.

2182
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:48,402
Please?

2183
01:28:48,477 --> 01:28:50,104
No.

2184
01:28:50,179 --> 01:28:53,945
Hey, what's up, shorty?
What's up, pretty girls?

2185
01:28:55,284 --> 01:28:57,946
See y'all when y'all get out.

2186
01:28:58,020 --> 01:28:59,681
Watch yourself.

2187
01:28:59,789 --> 01:29:01,450
What was that?

2188
01:29:01,524 --> 01:29:03,719
What the fuck was that?
It is what it is, sweetie.

2189
01:29:03,826 --> 01:29:04,918
Now can you step to the back, please?

2190
01:29:04,994 --> 01:29:05,883
You don't need to call me sweetie.

2191
01:29:05,983 --> 01:29:06,596
Maybe we should just go.

2192
01:29:06,696 --> 01:29:07,822
Maybe you should listen to your friend.

2193
01:29:07,897 --> 01:29:08,989
No, you don't need to call me sweetie.

2194
01:29:09,065 --> 01:29:11,226
All right, you want to come in,
you're gonna have to go

2195
01:29:11,334 --> 01:29:13,564
to the end of the line
and wait like everybody else.

2196
01:29:13,669 --> 01:29:15,227
I'm not gonna go to
the end of the fucking line.

2197
01:29:15,338 --> 01:29:16,498
Who the fuck are you?

2198
01:29:16,572 --> 01:29:19,439
I have just as much of a right to be here

2199
01:29:19,508 --> 01:29:21,169
as any of these little skanky girls!

2200
01:29:21,243 --> 01:29:23,040
What, am I not skanky enough for you?

2201
01:29:23,112 --> 01:29:24,841
You want me to hike up my fucking skirt?

2202
01:29:24,914 --> 01:29:28,213
What the fuck is your problem?
I'm not going anywhere!

2203
01:29:28,317 --> 01:29:31,252
You're just some roided out
freak with a fucking clipboard!

2204
01:29:31,354 --> 01:29:34,255
And your stupid little fucking
rope! You know what?

2205
01:29:34,357 --> 01:29:37,053
You may have power now,
but you're not God!

2206
01:29:37,159 --> 01:29:39,150
You're a doorman! Okay?

2207
01:29:39,228 --> 01:29:44,689
You're a doorman, doorman,
doorman, doorman, doorman!

2208
01:29:44,767 --> 01:29:48,498
So, fuck you, you fucking fag

2209
01:29:48,571 --> 01:29:50,596
with your fucking little faggy gloves.

2210
01:29:57,713 --> 01:29:59,010
I know.

2211
01:30:01,217 --> 01:30:03,583
You're right. I'm so sorry.

2212
01:30:04,453 --> 01:30:06,614
I fucking hate this job.

2213
01:30:06,722 --> 01:30:10,283
I don't want to be the one to pass
judgment and decide who gets in.

2214
01:30:10,393 --> 01:30:12,384
This shit makes me sick to my stomach.

2215
01:30:12,461 --> 01:30:15,021
I get the runs from the stress.

2216
01:30:15,097 --> 01:30:18,362
It's not 'cause you're not hot.
I would love to tap that ass.

2217
01:30:18,434 --> 01:30:21,733
I would tear that ass up.

2218
01:30:21,804 --> 01:30:24,706
I can't let you in 'cause you're old as fuck,

2219
01:30:24,806 --> 01:30:25,675
for this club,

2220
01:30:25,775 --> 01:30:28,437
not, you know, for the Earth.

2221
01:30:28,544 --> 01:30:29,568
What?

2222
01:30:29,645 --> 01:30:31,408
You old. She pregnant.

2223
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:34,449
Can't have a bunch of old,
pregnant bitches running around.

2224
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:35,983
That's crazy.

2225
01:30:36,085 --> 01:30:40,818
I'm only allowed to let in
5% black people. He said that. 5%.

2226
01:30:40,923 --> 01:30:42,823
That mean if there's 25 people here,

2227
01:30:42,925 --> 01:30:45,621
I get to let in one-and-a-quarter black people.

2228
01:30:45,728 --> 01:30:48,162
So I got to hope there's a black midget
in the crowd.

2229
01:30:48,264 --> 01:30:50,494
Now I feel guilty. I'm sorry.

2230
01:30:50,566 --> 01:30:52,033
Why y'all wanna be in here anyway?

2231
01:30:52,101 --> 01:30:54,069
Y'all need to be at a yoga class or something.

2232
01:30:54,136 --> 01:30:56,104
What the fuck is she doing at the club?

2233
01:30:56,172 --> 01:30:58,504
That's not even good parenting right there.

2234
01:30:58,607 --> 01:31:01,167
Your old ass should know better than that.

2235
01:31:01,277 --> 01:31:02,608
Oh, God.

2236
01:31:07,316 --> 01:31:09,614
Have the mushrooms kicked in yet?

2237
01:31:34,610 --> 01:31:37,306
This was a great idea, man.

2238
01:31:37,379 --> 01:31:40,644
This is the best idea I've ever had in my life.

2239
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:46,950
What are they gonna do?

2240
01:31:47,022 --> 01:31:53,291
What in the world are they doing?

2241
01:31:53,362 --> 01:31:56,672
If I shaved my stomach
and my chest, I would look

2242
01:31:56,772 --> 01:31:57,982
exactly like that.

2243
01:31:58,234 --> 01:32:00,725
Those guys are at work right now.

2244
01:32:02,071 --> 01:32:04,938
'What'd you do today?'
'I just lifted my brother.'

2245
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:09,371
No. Don't applaud. He'll fall.

2246
01:32:12,815 --> 01:32:15,909
I'm freaking out right now, man.

2247
01:32:16,018 --> 01:32:18,316
The mushrooms are turning on me.

2248
01:32:23,559 --> 01:32:25,686
Papa.

2249
01:32:25,761 --> 01:32:27,558
I'm not your papa!

2250
01:32:28,063 --> 01:32:29,860
Papa!

2251
01:32:32,034 --> 01:32:34,434
I can't deal with this shit, man!

2252
01:32:36,171 --> 01:32:39,402
Hold up. Hold up.
Ben, wait. Ben, Ben, Ben, wait!

2253
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,045
It's over.

2254
01:32:46,148 --> 01:32:47,274
What's over?

2255
01:32:47,349 --> 01:32:48,646
My youth.

2256
01:32:48,717 --> 01:32:50,446
Oh, don't say that.

2257
01:32:50,519 --> 01:32:51,986
It's true.

2258
01:32:53,522 --> 01:32:57,049
- I just wanna dance. I love dancing.
- So dance.

2259
01:32:57,159 --> 01:32:59,423
I can't dance.
I'm embarrassed.

2260
01:32:59,495 --> 01:33:01,463
I should be embarrassed.

2261
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:06,229
I'm a fucking whale, and I'm trying to get
into some stupid club and...

2262
01:33:06,335 --> 01:33:08,166
No, you look beautiful.

2263
01:33:08,237 --> 01:33:10,262
And you're young and you're tall,

2264
01:33:10,372 --> 01:33:14,035
and you got the good lips
and boobs, and you're young still.

2265
01:33:14,109 --> 01:33:16,600
I'm gonna be alone.

2266
01:33:16,712 --> 01:33:17,770
Debbie, no, you're not.

2267
01:33:17,846 --> 01:33:19,336
Yes, I am.

2268
01:33:21,584 --> 01:33:23,518
Oh, God!

2269
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:26,713
Fucking men!

2270
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:32,190
I get worse-looking and he gets better-looking,

2271
01:33:32,261 --> 01:33:34,559
and it's so fucking unfair.

2272
01:33:36,065 --> 01:33:37,362
Oh, fuck.

2273
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:39,624
We should go.

2274
01:33:41,303 --> 01:33:45,137
My babysitter always gets mad
when we come home past 12:00.

2275
01:33:46,275 --> 01:33:50,211
She's such a pissy little high-school cunt.

2276
01:33:52,781 --> 01:33:54,772
Let's move, gang!
Come on, Come on, Come on!

2277
01:33:54,883 --> 01:33:56,043
Jessica,
can you get these plates

2278
01:33:56,118 --> 01:33:57,225
and put them on the table, please?

2279
01:33:57,325 --> 01:33:57,853
This isn't funny.

2280
01:33:57,953 --> 01:33:59,818
That guy has 12 kids.
It's not funny. It's...

2281
01:33:59,888 --> 01:34:01,150
Now I get to start all over again!

2282
01:34:01,256 --> 01:34:03,747
This is sick.
This is a sick movie.

2283
01:34:03,826 --> 01:34:07,922
That's a lot of responsibility to be
joking about. That's not funny.

2284
01:34:07,997 --> 01:34:10,158
I got to turn this off.
It's freaking me out.

2285
01:34:10,265 --> 01:34:12,790
There are five different types
of chairs in this hotel room.

2286
01:34:12,901 --> 01:34:14,562
Holy fuck. What are they all doing in here?

2287
01:34:14,637 --> 01:34:16,332
These are five different types of chairs.

2288
01:34:16,405 --> 01:34:19,431
Get them out of here, man.
This is too many chairs for one room.

2289
01:34:19,508 --> 01:34:21,550
There's a guy that works
for this hotel. His whole job

2290
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:22,311
is to find chairs.

2291
01:34:22,411 --> 01:34:23,935
Look at this one. Look at it.

2292
01:34:24,013 --> 01:34:25,708
It's gold and red,
and it's kind of shiny.

2293
01:34:25,781 --> 01:34:27,408
Shiny thread? Unbelievable.

2294
01:34:27,483 --> 01:34:30,179
It is beautiful and it feels amazing.

2295
01:34:30,285 --> 01:34:33,652
The tall one's gawking at me
and the short one's being very droll.

2296
01:34:33,756 --> 01:34:34,745
I don't like them.

2297
01:34:34,823 --> 01:34:36,085
Oh, wow.

2298
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:39,491
It's weird that chairs even exist
when you're not sitting on them.

2299
01:34:39,595 --> 01:34:42,621
I'm up high!
I'm really high up.

2300
01:34:42,698 --> 01:34:45,030
I should've read the baby books.

2301
01:34:45,134 --> 01:34:46,931
Why didn't you read the baby books?

2302
01:34:47,002 --> 01:34:48,731
'Cause then it's real,
you know?

2303
01:34:48,804 --> 01:34:50,795
Dude, it's real whether
or not you read those books.

2304
01:34:50,873 --> 01:34:53,364
That baby's coming.

2305
01:34:53,442 --> 01:34:55,433
Oh, man!

2306
01:34:55,511 --> 01:34:57,172
Think they'll take us back?

2307
01:34:57,246 --> 01:34:58,508
Yes.

2308
01:34:59,682 --> 01:35:02,276
But I don't know why.

2309
01:35:02,351 --> 01:35:04,785
Do you ever wonder how somebody
could even like you?

2310
01:35:04,853 --> 01:35:07,981
All the time, man. Like every day.
I wonder how you like me.

2311
01:35:08,057 --> 01:35:12,016
How can Debbie like me?
She likes me. I mean, she loves me.

2312
01:35:12,127 --> 01:35:14,127
The biggest problem in our marriage is that

2313
01:35:14,227 --> 01:35:15,130
she wants me around.

2314
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:16,322
She loves me so much

2315
01:35:16,398 --> 01:35:18,798
that she wants me around all the time.

2316
01:35:18,867 --> 01:35:21,859
That's our biggest problem.
And I can't even accept that?

2317
01:35:21,970 --> 01:35:23,403
Like that upsets me?

2318
01:35:23,472 --> 01:35:24,666
What?

2319
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:26,264
She's the one. She loves me.

2320
01:35:26,341 --> 01:35:29,504
You can't believe people love you?

2321
01:35:29,578 --> 01:35:32,809
I love you, man!
Debbie loves you!

2322
01:35:32,881 --> 01:35:34,508
I don't think I can accept her love.

2323
01:35:34,583 --> 01:35:35,845
There's something wrong with me.

2324
01:35:35,918 --> 01:35:39,081
You can't accept love?

2325
01:35:39,154 --> 01:35:40,348
I don't know what it is.

2326
01:35:40,422 --> 01:35:43,220
Love? The most beautiful,
shiny, warmy thing in the world?

2327
01:35:43,325 --> 01:35:44,417
You can't accept it?

2328
01:35:44,493 --> 01:35:46,222
I have to go to this other chair.

2329
01:35:48,163 --> 01:35:49,858
Oh, this is a better energy.

2330
01:35:49,932 --> 01:35:53,163
You can't accept pure love?
You can't accept Debbie?

2331
01:35:53,235 --> 01:35:55,430
She's chosen to give you her life.

2332
01:35:55,537 --> 01:35:58,404
She's picked you as her life partner!

2333
01:35:58,507 --> 01:36:01,203
But you play fantasy baseball
because you can't accept her love?

2334
01:36:03,512 --> 01:36:05,503
I could accept it, man.

2335
01:36:06,949 --> 01:36:08,246
And Debbie's amazing, man.

2336
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:11,683
She's cool and she's funny and she smells good

2337
01:36:11,754 --> 01:36:14,780
and she's nice and her hair
always looks different.

2338
01:36:14,890 --> 01:36:16,255
She's too good for you, man.

2339
01:36:16,325 --> 01:36:18,418
Tastes like a rainbow.

2340
01:36:18,761 --> 01:36:21,195
You're disgusting.
You know, you're an urchin.

2341
01:36:21,263 --> 01:36:23,697
And she busts your balls
'cause you're a little bitch.

2342
01:36:23,766 --> 01:36:27,133
You're a filthy bitch!
And I'd bust your balls.

2343
01:36:28,403 --> 01:36:31,203
Debbie wants to give her life
to you, and Allison doesn't

2344
01:36:31,303 --> 01:36:32,474
want to do that with me.

2345
01:36:32,574 --> 01:36:34,804
And it makes me sad all day.

2346
01:36:36,445 --> 01:36:38,072
I want to go home.

2347
01:36:38,147 --> 01:36:39,774
I wanna go home, too.

2348
01:36:42,751 --> 01:36:44,981
Everything looks beautiful.
Thanks.

2349
01:36:45,087 --> 01:36:46,577
I went kind of overboard, huh?

2350
01:36:46,655 --> 01:36:47,883
No. It's great.

2351
01:36:47,956 --> 01:36:50,789
Your daughter only turns eight once.

2352
01:36:50,893 --> 01:36:53,020
Is Ben gonna come?

2353
01:36:53,095 --> 01:36:55,825
I don't think so.
I don't know why he would.

2354
01:37:09,845 --> 01:37:11,836
Oh, hey. What up, dawg?

2355
01:37:11,947 --> 01:37:13,073
Where have you been?

2356
01:37:13,148 --> 01:37:14,775
Around. You know?

2357
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:16,613
Just kind of doing my thing.

2358
01:37:16,685 --> 01:37:18,550
Why is everybody so mad at you?

2359
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:20,451
I don't know. Are they mad?
What have they been saying?

2360
01:37:20,556 --> 01:37:23,840
They've been saying, like,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

2361
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:24,860
'Ben's a prick.'

2362
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:25,984
They said that?

2363
01:37:26,061 --> 01:37:27,551
A lot.

2364
01:37:27,629 --> 01:37:28,857
That sucks.

2365
01:37:28,931 --> 01:37:30,626
What does it mean?

2366
01:37:31,466 --> 01:37:33,457
Penis. It means penis.

2367
01:37:33,535 --> 01:37:34,661
Oh.

2368
01:37:36,338 --> 01:37:37,635
Penis.

2369
01:37:39,408 --> 01:37:41,968
Babe, we're running low on plates.

2370
01:37:42,077 --> 01:37:43,408
Hey, Ben! What's up, man?

2371
01:37:43,478 --> 01:37:44,945
What's happening, man?

2372
01:37:45,013 --> 01:37:46,947
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey, Debbie.

2373
01:37:47,015 --> 01:37:48,505
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

2374
01:37:48,617 --> 01:37:49,777
Hi.

2375
01:37:50,786 --> 01:37:53,152
Did you just get pink cupcakes
or yellow cupcakes?

2376
01:37:53,255 --> 01:37:54,654
I just got yellow cupcakes.

2377
01:37:54,723 --> 01:37:56,213
I thought I said get pink cupcakes.

2378
01:37:56,291 --> 01:37:58,816
- I can run out. I'll get some more.
- Nah, it's no big deal.

2379
01:37:58,927 --> 01:38:00,326
- I don't mind.
- No, it doesn't matter.

2380
01:38:00,429 --> 01:38:02,158
- You sure?
- Yeah. You look really cute in that.

2381
01:38:02,264 --> 01:38:03,663
All right.

2382
01:38:06,001 --> 01:38:08,629
- Well, that was fast, you pussy.
- I'm a...

2383
01:38:08,704 --> 01:38:12,305
You're the one that got
dressed up like a cholo on

2384
01:38:12,405 --> 01:38:14,472
Easter to come to this party.

2385
01:38:14,543 --> 01:38:17,034
How are things at Butt-Fucking-Ham Palace?

2386
01:38:17,145 --> 01:38:21,479
You look like Babe Ruth's
gay brother, Gabe Ruth.

2387
01:38:21,550 --> 01:38:24,815
Well played, sir. That was good.

2388
01:38:24,887 --> 01:38:25,945
You gonna talk to Allison?

2389
01:38:26,021 --> 01:38:27,648
Yeah, I was just about to.

2390
01:38:27,723 --> 01:38:29,213
Right on.

2391
01:38:29,291 --> 01:38:30,758
It's a doll.

2392
01:38:30,826 --> 01:38:32,293
Thanks, Ben.

2393
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:37,999
I just don't think we can make it work.

2394
01:38:38,066 --> 01:38:40,967
We can get back on track,
and everything's gonna be great.

2395
01:38:41,036 --> 01:38:43,834
You're just being nice,
and I'm being nice,

2396
01:38:43,906 --> 01:38:46,715
and just because we're two
nice people doesn't mean...

2397
01:38:46,815 --> 01:38:48,036
we should stay together.

2398
01:38:48,143 --> 01:38:52,239
I don't want this baby to determine the rest
of our lives. You know?

2399
01:38:52,347 --> 01:38:54,872
Me not wanting to do this alone
isn't enough of a reason

2400
01:38:54,983 --> 01:38:59,010
to drag you into a relationship
with me. It's just not fair.

2401
01:38:59,087 --> 01:39:04,218
And don't repeat this, but God,
I don't want to end up like Debbie.

2402
01:39:04,326 --> 01:39:05,486
But Debbie's happy.

2403
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:07,687
Yeah, she's happy today.

2404
01:39:07,763 --> 01:39:09,993
But every day is a constant struggle for them

2405
01:39:10,065 --> 01:39:11,760
because they're not right for each other.

2406
01:39:11,867 --> 01:39:13,900
You know? And they have to
force it, and I don't want...

2407
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:14,768
us to have to do that.

2408
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:18,067
I don't want to force you
to be what I think you should be.

2409
01:39:18,173 --> 01:39:20,505
That's wrong of me because you're great.

2410
01:39:20,575 --> 01:39:24,705
You really are. You're great
the way you are, and...

2411
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:28,910
I mean, you like to get high,
and you like to do shrooms in Vegas.

2412
01:39:29,017 --> 01:39:31,247
I didn't do shrooms in Vegas.
Who am I to stop you?

2413
01:39:31,353 --> 01:39:33,545
Who am I to tell you that
that's wrong? It's not wrong.

2414
01:39:33,645 --> 01:39:34,288
It's who you are.

2415
01:39:34,389 --> 01:39:36,949
It's what you enjoy and that's your life and...

2416
01:39:37,059 --> 01:39:40,256
I'm not that guy anymore.

2417
01:39:40,362 --> 01:39:42,296
I mean, we can be friends.

2418
01:39:42,397 --> 01:39:46,231
And you can be there when the baby is born,

2419
01:39:46,301 --> 01:39:48,462
and in the baby's life as much as you want.

2420
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:50,401
I hope you will be.

2421
01:39:50,472 --> 01:39:53,771
I just...
I think that if you just...

2422
01:39:53,875 --> 01:39:56,867
I don't know. If you give me a shot
to just show you that I'm...

2423
01:39:56,945 --> 01:39:58,139
- Excuse me?
- Oh, shit.

2424
01:39:58,246 --> 01:39:59,372
Can you grab the video camera?

2425
01:39:59,448 --> 01:40:02,383
- We're gonna sing Happy Birthday now.
- Yeah.

2426
01:40:02,617 --> 01:40:05,313
I'm sorry. I got to go.

2427
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:06,478
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

2428
01:40:06,588 --> 01:40:07,782
I'll be right back,
though, all right?

2429
01:40:07,889 --> 01:40:10,289
- We'll finish talking.
- Yeah, yeah. Okay, go.

2430
01:40:15,564 --> 01:40:16,656
What happened?

2431
01:40:16,732 --> 01:40:17,926
Thanks for warning me, man.

2432
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,901
I just walked into a fucking
buzz saw. She rejected me.

2433
01:40:20,969 --> 01:40:23,301
'Cause you,
for some insane reason,

2434
01:40:23,405 --> 01:40:25,839
told Debbie that I did
mushrooms with you in Vegas!

2435
01:40:25,941 --> 01:40:27,067
She gets mad 'cause I smoke pot!

2436
01:40:27,142 --> 01:40:29,337
Now I'm upping it to fucking
psychedelics! Thanks!

2437
01:40:29,444 --> 01:40:31,241
Really? I thought she'd take you back.

2438
01:40:31,313 --> 01:40:33,213
You know why she just rejected me?

2439
01:40:33,281 --> 01:40:34,714
'Cause you're such a shitty husband,

2440
01:40:34,783 --> 01:40:38,082
she thinks I'm gonna turn
into a shitty husband.

2441
01:40:43,492 --> 01:40:47,189
Happy Birthday to you

2442
01:40:47,295 --> 01:40:50,787
Happy Birthday to you

2443
01:40:52,501 --> 01:40:55,436
Jessica! Right here!
Can we get a photo?

2444
01:40:55,504 --> 01:40:57,529
- When are you due?
- I got two months.

2445
01:40:57,639 --> 01:40:58,765
- Really?
- Yeah.

2446
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:01,866
- Wow, you're so big already.
- Yeah.

2447
01:41:01,977 --> 01:41:04,707
- When is that baby popping out?
- I got two months to go.

2448
01:41:04,813 --> 01:41:06,843
- Really? Are you dilated yet?
I can tell.

2449
01:41:06,943 --> 01:41:07,349
Wow, wow!

2450
01:41:07,449 --> 01:41:11,545
You look fantastic. You look... Are you gonna,
like, give birth right now?

2451
01:41:11,653 --> 01:41:14,053
Wow, you're about to drop any second.

2452
01:41:14,156 --> 01:41:15,350
- You know what?
- I love your broach.

2453
01:41:15,457 --> 01:41:17,789
You don't need to lie to me.
I don't appreciate it.

2454
01:41:17,859 --> 01:41:19,451
I know I look like a fat cow.

2455
01:41:19,528 --> 01:41:21,496
- And I'm sweating profusely. I know that.
- No, no.

2456
01:41:21,563 --> 01:41:25,226
No, you don't look like
a fat cow at all. You look great.

2457
01:41:25,333 --> 01:41:27,198
So, I have to get going in.
They're calling me.

2458
01:41:27,302 --> 01:41:29,361
Steve, hey. Help me out.
Give me an interview, please.

2459
01:41:29,471 --> 01:41:30,631
Well, I just need to run in.

2460
01:41:30,705 --> 01:41:33,503
You know what? Just say into the camera, 'You're
watching E! Entertainment.'

2461
01:41:33,575 --> 01:41:34,701
- Congratulations.
- Just give me that.

2462
01:41:34,810 --> 01:41:37,005
No, Steve, don't be an asshole! Come on.

2463
01:41:37,079 --> 01:41:39,206
I'm not being an asshole.

2464
01:41:39,915 --> 01:41:42,645
Wow, you managed to turn
Steve Carell into an asshole.

2465
01:41:42,717 --> 01:41:44,685
- No easy feat.
- Shut up, Brent.

2466
01:41:45,153 --> 01:41:47,314
You screwed me, Dad, okay?

2467
01:41:47,389 --> 01:41:50,187
You said everything was gonna
be fine and nothing is fine.

2468
01:41:50,258 --> 01:41:51,782
Nothing is fine.

2469
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:55,853
Ben, I've been divorced three times.
Why would you listen to me?

2470
01:41:55,964 --> 01:41:57,454
Because you were the only one giving me advice!

2471
01:41:57,532 --> 01:41:59,796
And it was terrible advice!

2472
01:41:59,868 --> 01:42:03,565
You can go around blaming everyone
else, but in the end,

2473
01:42:03,672 --> 01:42:08,041
until you take responsibility for yourself,
none of this is gonna work out.

2474
01:42:08,143 --> 01:42:11,135
I don't know how to take
responsibility for myself, okay?

2475
01:42:11,213 --> 01:42:13,078
- I didn't read the baby books!
- You didn't read the books?

2476
01:42:13,181 --> 01:42:15,741
I just smoke less pot.
I don't know what to do. I'm an idiot!

2477
01:42:15,851 --> 01:42:18,081
What... Tell me what to do!

2478
01:42:18,153 --> 01:42:20,246
I don't know. I don't know.

2479
01:42:20,355 --> 01:42:23,984
Ben, I love you.
What can I tell you?

2480
01:42:24,059 --> 01:42:26,152
Just tell me what to do.

2481
01:42:29,664 --> 01:42:31,723
Stone, you settling in okay?

2482
01:42:31,833 --> 01:42:34,267
Best job I ever had.
Like to hear it.

2483
01:43:41,469 --> 01:43:43,630
Allison, thank you for coming in.

2484
01:43:43,738 --> 01:43:49,438
I don't want to shock you
but we know what's under that jacket.

2485
01:43:50,278 --> 01:43:52,439
You're pregnant,
have been for a while.

2486
01:43:52,514 --> 01:43:55,813
From my count, you're right
around eight months.

2487
01:43:55,917 --> 01:43:58,784
And I don't know why you felt
you couldn't tell us.

2488
01:43:58,853 --> 01:44:00,320
I'm really sorry.

2489
01:44:00,422 --> 01:44:02,982
This is Hollywood.
We don't like liars.

2490
01:44:03,091 --> 01:44:06,356
I just...
I wasn't expecting this and...

2491
01:44:06,461 --> 01:44:09,157
I didn't know how to handle it,
and I didn't want to lose my job.

2492
01:44:09,264 --> 01:44:11,630
- I'm really sorry.
- It's unfortunate.

2493
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:14,464
It's unfortunate you didn't tell us because

2494
01:44:15,503 --> 01:44:17,630
you would've found out
that we thought it's great.

2495
01:44:17,706 --> 01:44:19,037
- Really?
- Yeah.

2496
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:21,665
So we did some research.

2497
01:44:21,776 --> 01:44:26,475
And turns out,
people like pregnant.

2498
01:44:26,548 --> 01:44:27,640
Oh, my God!

2499
01:44:27,716 --> 01:44:29,445
The bigger you are,
the bigger your numbers.

2500
01:44:30,619 --> 01:44:33,884
I was surprised 'cause I feel the opposite.

2501
01:44:33,955 --> 01:44:40,861
We're gonna do a whole maternity
month on E! Mommy.

2502
01:44:41,896 --> 01:44:44,558
You're gonna interview all the pregnant celebs.

2503
01:44:44,666 --> 01:44:46,361
- Really?
- Yes.

2504
01:44:46,468 --> 01:44:47,696
Scary!

2505
01:44:47,802 --> 01:44:52,068
You're pregnant, they're pregnant,
you can talk about being pregnant.

2506
01:44:52,173 --> 01:44:56,200
It just grosses me out when
I know that people are pregnant.

2507
01:44:56,311 --> 01:44:59,041
'Cause I think about the birth.
Everything's so wet.

2508
01:44:59,147 --> 01:45:01,741
And everything that goes into it.
None of the gross stuff.

2509
01:45:01,850 --> 01:45:06,082
But you know, hopes, dreams,
whatever, it's gonna be great.

2510
01:45:06,187 --> 01:45:08,382
Oh, my God.
This is such good news.

2511
01:45:08,490 --> 01:45:10,549
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

2512
01:45:10,659 --> 01:45:14,220
And then,
after the baby is out...

2513
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:17,521
- Tight.
-...tighten it back up.

2514
01:45:17,599 --> 01:45:19,499
- And please don't lie to us again.
- Okay.

2515
01:45:19,567 --> 01:45:22,764
'Cause maybe someday we could be friends.

2516
01:45:22,871 --> 01:45:25,169
Okay. I won't. I'm sorry.

2517
01:45:25,707 --> 01:45:27,675
- I just don't like secrets.
- Okay.

2518
01:45:29,077 --> 01:45:31,204
You know, it's a rare thing
that you live to see the day

2519
01:45:31,279 --> 01:45:33,577
your wildest dreams come true.

2520
01:45:33,682 --> 01:45:37,015
I mean, what is there left to want?
I get to go to Legoland.

2521
01:45:37,085 --> 01:45:38,279
- Shut up, Pete.
- Say it!

2522
01:45:38,386 --> 01:45:39,717
Legoland!
Legoland!

2523
01:45:39,788 --> 01:45:41,688
Legoland!

2524
01:45:41,756 --> 01:45:43,621
Don't get them all riled up before the drive.

2525
01:45:43,725 --> 01:45:45,750
I shouldn't have given them
all that meth, then.

2526
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:47,259
We'll be back on Sunday.

2527
01:45:47,362 --> 01:45:49,728
Or Saturday. You never know.
We might see it all in one day.

2528
01:45:49,798 --> 01:45:51,561
Sunday. Let's go.

2529
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:53,258
Guess what? I'm scared there's no one to trust.

2530
01:45:53,368 --> 01:45:55,598
You can trust me.

2531
01:45:55,704 --> 01:45:57,763
You are gonna fuck me over, aren't you?

2532
01:45:57,872 --> 01:45:59,999
Oh, for Christ's sake.

2533
01:46:00,075 --> 01:46:01,633
You are.

2534
01:46:01,710 --> 01:46:06,204
Are you retarded? Or just brain-dead
from whiffing fumes out there in the swamp?

2535
01:46:06,281 --> 01:46:09,978
- Ow, ow, ow. - That's what I am to you,
isn't it? Swamp trash, just like my mom.

2536
01:46:15,623 --> 01:46:16,783
Hello?

2537
01:46:16,891 --> 01:46:19,121
Hey, what's up, Daddy?
What are you doing?

2538
01:46:19,227 --> 01:46:23,391
Just smoking a joint, drinking
some beers, you know. Rocking.

2539
01:46:24,065 --> 01:46:25,896
We're about to go to a new club. You coming?

2540
01:46:25,967 --> 01:46:28,561
No. I'm gonna pack it in soon, I think.

2541
01:46:28,636 --> 01:46:30,297
What's he doing?

2542
01:46:30,372 --> 01:46:31,600
He says he's gonna call it a night.

2543
01:46:31,673 --> 01:46:33,641
Dude, it's like 8:15, man.

2544
01:46:33,708 --> 01:46:36,768
Yeah, I know. I'm just tired.

2545
01:46:36,845 --> 01:46:38,904
- Is he depressed?
- You depressed?

2546
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:40,675
No, I feel great. I like it.

2547
01:46:40,749 --> 01:46:42,216
He says no.

2548
01:46:42,283 --> 01:46:43,580
Ask him if he's gonna kill himself.

2549
01:46:43,651 --> 01:46:45,016
You gonna kill yourself?

2550
01:46:45,086 --> 01:46:47,111
No, I'm not. Okay? Thank you.

2551
01:46:47,188 --> 01:46:49,613
Tell him not to jerk off with
a noose around his neck.

2552
01:46:49,713 --> 01:46:50,351
It's dangerous.

2553
01:46:50,458 --> 01:46:52,480
You shouldn't jerk off with
a noose around your neck...

2554
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:53,359
'cause it's dangerous.

2555
01:46:53,461 --> 01:46:54,928
Okay. Very good.

2556
01:46:54,996 --> 01:46:58,659
And tell him if he has to, tell him he needs
a teammate or a spotter there.

2557
01:46:58,767 --> 01:47:02,760
Right. And if you do, you should have
a teammate or a spotter there.

2558
01:47:02,837 --> 01:47:03,963
Great.

2559
01:47:04,038 --> 01:47:06,370
He says your mom's already there.

2560
01:47:06,441 --> 01:47:07,738
Uncool, man.

2561
01:47:15,383 --> 01:47:17,180
Okay, okay.

2562
01:47:17,285 --> 01:47:18,616
Okay.

2563
01:47:19,454 --> 01:47:20,614
Hi, Dr. Howard?

2564
01:47:20,688 --> 01:47:22,713
No, this is Dr. Angelo.

2565
01:47:22,791 --> 01:47:23,849
How can I help you?

2566
01:47:23,958 --> 01:47:26,119
I'm a patient of Dr. Howard's,

2567
01:47:26,194 --> 01:47:28,856
and I'm going into labor
and I need to speak with him.

2568
01:47:28,963 --> 01:47:30,658
I actually don't know where he is tonight.

2569
01:47:30,732 --> 01:47:33,599
But I've made myself available to his patients,

2570
01:47:33,668 --> 01:47:35,158
and I'd be happy to help you.

2571
01:47:35,236 --> 01:47:37,568
Can you help me find him?
Can you give me his number?

2572
01:47:37,672 --> 01:47:39,867
Oh, no. You know what? Actually,
I'm under strict instructions

2573
01:47:39,974 --> 01:47:42,135
not to give out his number,
but I can help you through this.

2574
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:43,575
No, no. No, no, no.

2575
01:47:43,678 --> 01:47:46,647
I want to speak to my own doctor.
You really won't give me his number?

2576
01:47:46,714 --> 01:47:49,064
Because this is my first baby,
and he promised that

2577
01:47:49,164 --> 01:47:50,218
he would be here for me

2578
01:47:50,318 --> 01:47:52,878
and I need you to give me...
Give me his number, okay?

2579
01:47:52,987 --> 01:47:54,887
Dr. Howard's not available tonight.

2580
01:47:54,989 --> 01:47:57,480
But everything's gonna be okay,
I assure you.

2581
01:47:57,559 --> 01:48:01,586
No, I don't want you to help me
because I have no idea who you are!

2582
01:48:01,696 --> 01:48:05,496
I want my own goddamn doctor!
You make sure he calls me!

2583
01:48:05,567 --> 01:48:07,592
Oh, shit. Okay.

2584
01:48:09,504 --> 01:48:11,335
Oh, shit!

2585
01:48:23,318 --> 01:48:24,376
Hello?

2586
01:48:24,486 --> 01:48:26,601
Ben, it's me. Can you come?
'Cause the baby's coming.

2587
01:48:26,701 --> 01:48:27,182
Can you come?

2588
01:48:27,255 --> 01:48:31,089
Oh, God. Allison.
I'm so happy you're calling.

2589
01:48:31,192 --> 01:48:33,752
I have so many thing's
I've been wanting to say to you.

2590
01:48:33,862 --> 01:48:36,353
I wanna apologize for things.
It's all I can think about.

2591
01:48:36,431 --> 01:48:37,921
No, listen. Wait. Listen.

2592
01:48:38,032 --> 01:48:40,296
I need you to come help me, okay?
Because the baby's coming.

2593
01:48:40,401 --> 01:48:41,527
So can you come help me?

2594
01:48:41,603 --> 01:48:43,628
- Wait. The baby's coming right now?
- Yes. Right now.

2595
01:48:43,738 --> 01:48:45,865
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2596
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:49,307
Is it happening? It's happening now?
Push. Push...

2597
01:48:51,312 --> 01:48:52,779
Breathe like this...
No, no, no, no.

2598
01:48:52,881 --> 01:48:55,645
You need to come now because
the contractions are happening,

2599
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:59,049
and they really hurt and the doctor isn't here,
and I can't get hold of him.

2600
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:01,970
And he said he was gonna be
here, right? You were there...

2601
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:02,920
when he said that.

2602
01:49:02,991 --> 01:49:04,618
Okay, okay,
I'll come right now.

2603
01:49:04,726 --> 01:49:06,216
Nobody's here.
I'm coming right now.

2604
01:49:06,294 --> 01:49:08,228
...not anywhere,
I can't reach them, please.

2605
01:49:08,296 --> 01:49:09,786
Please, please hurry.
I'll just... So should I...

2606
01:49:09,898 --> 01:49:10,956
I'll meet you at the hospital, okay?

2607
01:49:11,065 --> 01:49:13,287
No! Don't meet me at the
hospital! No, no, I need you...

2608
01:49:13,387 --> 01:49:14,432
to drive me. I can't drive.

2609
01:49:14,502 --> 01:49:16,231
- I can't drive like this.
- No? You can't drive? Okay.

2610
01:49:16,304 --> 01:49:17,931
I'll get gas and then I'll pick you up.

2611
01:49:18,006 --> 01:49:19,837
- You have to get gas?
- I need to just get cash.

2612
01:49:19,941 --> 01:49:21,431
No. Don't get cash. Just come.

2613
01:49:21,509 --> 01:49:23,625
I need to get cash because my
car's on empty, I won't...

2614
01:49:23,725 --> 01:49:24,410
even make it there.

2615
01:49:24,479 --> 01:49:28,006
No, just come right now.
I'm not fucking around, okay?

2616
01:49:28,116 --> 01:49:29,743
This is serious and I'm alone.

2617
01:49:29,817 --> 01:49:33,014
It's the last thing you need to do is...
Just get here!

2618
01:49:33,121 --> 01:49:35,248
Look, if you keep yelling
at me, I'm never gonna get there.

2619
01:49:35,323 --> 01:49:37,052
You just need to calm down for two... Okay.

2620
01:49:44,966 --> 01:49:47,958
Don't run out of gas.
Don't run out of gas. Come on!

2621
01:49:52,974 --> 01:49:54,305
Hello?

2622
01:49:54,542 --> 01:49:58,603
Please be in there.
Hello? Hello? Hello?

2623
01:50:01,649 --> 01:50:02,946
Allison?

2624
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:10,618
Hello?

2625
01:50:10,692 --> 01:50:12,455
Ben?
Allison.

2626
01:50:13,561 --> 01:50:14,823
What is this,
like a water birth?

2627
01:50:14,896 --> 01:50:17,502
- What are we doing? Should we go?
Should I... I have the...

2628
01:50:17,602 --> 01:50:17,732
Shh.

2629
01:50:17,832 --> 01:50:22,326
Just relax, okay? Just be mellow, 'cause
that's what this is all about.

2630
01:50:22,403 --> 01:50:24,462
Because if it gets too stressful in here,

2631
01:50:24,539 --> 01:50:26,973
then the baby is born
into a stressful environment,

2632
01:50:27,041 --> 01:50:31,205
and then he's wired for stress
for the rest of his life. So just...

2633
01:50:32,714 --> 01:50:34,739
Just be calm.

2634
01:50:34,849 --> 01:50:36,009
Okay.

2635
01:50:37,218 --> 01:50:40,381
Okay, let's relax. Okay.

2636
01:50:41,556 --> 01:50:42,682
Do you want to talk about things?

2637
01:50:42,757 --> 01:50:45,021
I feel really bad about, like,
a lot of the shit I did.

2638
01:50:45,093 --> 01:50:46,560
I can't believe I said some of that.

2639
01:50:46,661 --> 01:50:47,923
That's all I think about in my head.

2640
01:50:47,996 --> 01:50:49,327
I don't wanna talk about it.

2641
01:50:49,397 --> 01:50:51,868
But maybe we could bring the
baby into a reconciled...

2642
01:50:51,968 --> 01:50:52,992
place so we can talk...

2643
01:50:53,067 --> 01:50:55,331
No. I don't wanna go there.

2644
01:50:55,403 --> 01:50:58,668
Don't go there. Okay?
Help me stay relaxed.

2645
01:50:58,740 --> 01:51:00,765
So, what should I do?

2646
01:51:00,842 --> 01:51:02,400
You need to call Dr. Howard.

2647
01:51:03,578 --> 01:51:04,670
Hello?

2648
01:51:04,746 --> 01:51:09,740
Hello, yes, this is Ben Stone.
I'm calling on behalf of Allison Scott.

2649
01:51:09,851 --> 01:51:11,512
We need Dr. Howard.
It's an emergency.

2650
01:51:11,586 --> 01:51:14,180
Yeah. He's at San Francisco at bar mitzvah.

2651
01:51:14,255 --> 01:51:17,622
He's at a bar mitzvah in San Francisco?
Do you know when he gets back?

2652
01:51:17,725 --> 01:51:19,249
In three days.

2653
01:51:20,728 --> 01:51:22,423
Do you have his cell number,
by any chance?

2654
01:51:25,733 --> 01:51:28,861
Hey! Good news.

2655
01:51:28,936 --> 01:51:31,803
I got his number right here.
I'm gonna call him right now.

2656
01:51:31,906 --> 01:51:35,069
Oh, great. Thank you so much. Oh, my God.
I'm so glad you're here. Thank you.

2657
01:51:35,143 --> 01:51:37,907
I'm glad I'm here, too.
Thank you.

2658
01:51:37,979 --> 01:51:39,708
I shouldn't have told you
you were a fucking lunatic.

2659
01:51:39,781 --> 01:51:42,113
I shouldn't have said that.
I feel terrible about it and...

2660
01:51:42,216 --> 01:51:45,049
No, it's okay.
We're past it. We're past it.

2661
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:46,609
I'm sorry I told you to fuck your bong.

2662
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:49,088
It's okay. I didn't.

2663
01:51:49,157 --> 01:51:52,149
Let's just drop it now.
We're over it.

2664
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:55,388
I'm gonna call him right now.
You're doing so great.

2665
01:51:55,463 --> 01:51:59,559
Hello, it's Dr. Howard. I'm not here right now.
Please leave a message.

2666
01:51:59,634 --> 01:52:03,263
Hey, Doc Howard.
Ben Stone calling.

2667
01:52:03,337 --> 01:52:05,271
Guess what the fuck's up?

2668
01:52:05,339 --> 01:52:08,308
Allison's going into labor
and you are not fucking here.

2669
01:52:08,409 --> 01:52:11,810
Now, where are you? You're at
a fucking bar mitzvah in San Francisco,

2670
01:52:11,913 --> 01:52:13,904
you motherfucking piece of shit!

2671
01:52:13,981 --> 01:52:15,278
And you know what I'm gonna have to do now?

2672
01:52:15,349 --> 01:52:16,475
I'm gonna have to kill you.

2673
01:52:16,584 --> 01:52:18,984
I'm gonna have to
pop a fucking cap in your ass.

2674
01:52:19,087 --> 01:52:20,816
You're dead! You're Tupac!

2675
01:52:20,922 --> 01:52:22,913
You are fucking Biggie,
you piece of shit!

2676
01:52:22,990 --> 01:52:24,184
I hope you fucking die

2677
01:52:24,292 --> 01:52:27,455
or drop the fucking chair
and kill that fucking kid!

2678
01:52:27,528 --> 01:52:29,996
Hope your plane crashes.
Peace, fucker!

2679
01:52:36,671 --> 01:52:37,933
- Hey.
- Hey.

2680
01:52:38,005 --> 01:52:39,097
Did you talk to him?

2681
01:52:39,173 --> 01:52:43,667
I didn't talk to him directly.
I left him a very nice message, though.

2682
01:52:43,778 --> 01:52:46,440
And... Okay.

2683
01:52:46,514 --> 01:52:49,074
What I'm about to tell you isn't that bad.

2684
01:52:49,150 --> 01:52:50,708
You should know that going in.

2685
01:52:50,785 --> 01:52:53,686
We can get through this,
and it's just a little hiccough,

2686
01:52:53,788 --> 01:52:55,119
but everything will be fine. Okay?

2687
01:52:55,189 --> 01:52:57,521
Do you trust me when I say
everything will be fine?

2688
01:52:57,625 --> 01:53:00,025
- I can deal with it.
- Okay.

2689
01:53:00,128 --> 01:53:03,859
So, Dr. Howard is at a bar mitzvah.

2690
01:53:03,965 --> 01:53:05,262
A bar mitzvah?

2691
01:53:05,333 --> 01:53:06,891
It's a Jewish rite of passage.

2692
01:53:07,001 --> 01:53:10,664
And he's gonna be there
for the next three days,

2693
01:53:10,738 --> 01:53:14,037
so he will not be able to be here tonight.

2694
01:53:14,142 --> 01:53:15,404
Oh, no.

2695
01:53:17,411 --> 01:53:18,901
It's okay.

2696
01:53:20,014 --> 01:53:21,174
What do you think we should do?

2697
01:53:21,249 --> 01:53:22,580
Okay. I know exactly what to do.

2698
01:53:22,650 --> 01:53:25,380
All we do is we'll get in
the car, I'll drive to the hospital,

2699
01:53:25,486 --> 01:53:28,148
and on the way, we will call
every gynecologist we've met.

2700
01:53:28,222 --> 01:53:31,157
Someone will be available.
You know?

2701
01:53:31,225 --> 01:53:33,159
- Okay. I can do that.
- Okay. Good.

2702
01:53:33,227 --> 01:53:36,025
I mean, we still have time.
I mean, how far apart are your contractions?

2703
01:53:36,097 --> 01:53:38,759
- I think, like, seven minutes.
- Seven minutes!

2704
01:53:38,866 --> 01:53:40,993
See? Not until four minutes
is it really coming.

2705
01:53:41,068 --> 01:53:42,831
And has your water broken, even?

2706
01:53:42,904 --> 01:53:45,168
I don't know. I'm in the tub.

2707
01:53:45,239 --> 01:53:47,537
That's a good point.
Have you had your bloody show?

2708
01:53:47,608 --> 01:53:48,836
What? What's that?

2709
01:53:48,910 --> 01:53:51,504
It's, it's... I mean, it's
a bloody mucusy discharge.

2710
01:53:51,579 --> 01:53:53,877
But it only comes out right before
the baby's gonna come,

2711
01:53:53,948 --> 01:53:55,779
so if that hasn't happened,
we have time.

2712
01:53:55,883 --> 01:53:58,681
We can make it to the hospital.
It's no problem.

2713
01:53:58,753 --> 01:54:00,880
You read the baby books.

2714
01:54:00,955 --> 01:54:04,550
Yeah. I did. I read three of them, actually.

2715
01:54:04,625 --> 01:54:06,616
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

2716
01:54:10,298 --> 01:54:12,425
Hey. Hey, you okay?

2717
01:54:15,536 --> 01:54:16,730
Okay.

2718
01:54:21,576 --> 01:54:23,976
Wait.
Are we allowed to park here?

2719
01:54:24,078 --> 01:54:27,809
It's okay. I stole this from Martin's grandma.

2720
01:54:27,915 --> 01:54:30,816
- Oh, that was really sweet of you.
- Thanks.

2721
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:35,483
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

2722
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:37,615
Okay. Inches away.

2723
01:54:37,725 --> 01:54:39,716
- Okay.
- We're close.

2724
01:54:39,794 --> 01:54:44,163
Home stretch. Hello.
This is Allison Scott.

2725
01:54:44,265 --> 01:54:46,290
Dr. Kuni said he would let you
know we were coming?

2726
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,960
- Oh, he did. We'll take good care of you.
- Okay.

2727
01:54:49,070 --> 01:54:50,230
- Samuel?
- Yeah?

2728
01:54:50,304 --> 01:54:53,671
This is Allison Scott.
Please admit her into Room 307.

2729
01:54:53,774 --> 01:54:54,832
Hi.

2730
01:54:54,909 --> 01:54:56,206
Hey.

2731
01:54:56,277 --> 01:54:57,801
You're our nurse?

2732
01:54:57,879 --> 01:55:00,939
That's why I'm holding the clipboard.

2733
01:55:01,015 --> 01:55:04,416
So, what else is up with you guys?

2734
01:55:04,485 --> 01:55:07,113
I'm just joking.
Let's have a baby, huh?

2735
01:55:07,188 --> 01:55:08,348
Yeah.

2736
01:55:10,157 --> 01:55:13,092
Jeez, I'm sorry it took me so long
to find that vein.

2737
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:17,153
That little guy really
didn't want me to find him.

2738
01:55:17,265 --> 01:55:19,130
Is that the baby on that one right there?

2739
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:20,258
Yeah.

2740
01:55:20,334 --> 01:55:22,598
So we can tell how the little
guy or gal is doing.

2741
01:55:22,670 --> 01:55:23,932
Okay.

2742
01:55:24,705 --> 01:55:28,266
Hello, Allison. Ben.
Interesting night.

2743
01:55:28,342 --> 01:55:30,333
We really, really appreciate you coming, man.

2744
01:55:30,411 --> 01:55:34,347
What else do I have to do,
I mean, besides sleep? Totally kidding.

2745
01:55:34,415 --> 01:55:35,746
What happened to your doctor?

2746
01:55:35,816 --> 01:55:37,875
He's at a bar mitzvah in San Francisco.

2747
01:55:37,952 --> 01:55:39,579
He didn't tell us, though.

2748
01:55:39,687 --> 01:55:40,847
- Nice.
- Yeah.

2749
01:55:40,922 --> 01:55:44,414
Lucky for you, I don't have any Jewish friends.

2750
01:55:44,525 --> 01:55:47,517
Dr. Kuni, I really wanna do this
naturally. I don't wanna use drugs.

2751
01:55:47,595 --> 01:55:51,190
Okay, let's just take a look
and see what happens, okay?

2752
01:55:51,265 --> 01:55:53,563
Foetal heart rate is good.
Samuel, where are we?

2753
01:55:53,634 --> 01:55:56,569
- Four centimeters.
- Four centimeters what?

2754
01:55:56,637 --> 01:55:58,798
- Dilated?
- Dilated. That's right. Focus.

2755
01:55:58,906 --> 01:56:01,397
Pay attention, okay?
We're a team. Okay?

2756
01:56:03,077 --> 01:56:04,840
I wanna get the fuck out of here.

2757
01:56:04,912 --> 01:56:06,004
What?

2758
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:07,274
I just wanna get the fuck out of here.

2759
01:56:07,348 --> 01:56:09,111
Okay. Just relax,
man, just relax.

2760
01:56:09,216 --> 01:56:10,808
Oh, man, I don't fucking like hospitals.

2761
01:56:10,885 --> 01:56:13,376
I know, but, Jonah,
this is beautiful.

2762
01:56:13,454 --> 01:56:16,919
I just think you need to relax
and embrace the beauty of...

2763
01:56:17,019 --> 01:56:18,756
another life joining our gang.

2764
01:56:18,826 --> 01:56:21,294
We're having a baby.
We are having a baby.

2765
01:56:21,395 --> 01:56:24,125
I'm not having shit besides
a fucking panic attack.

2766
01:56:24,231 --> 01:56:28,497
There's probably a fucking room
back there full of dead bodies!

2767
01:56:28,602 --> 01:56:30,297
You guys wanna be here when one rolls out

2768
01:56:30,404 --> 01:56:33,066
and just fucking coughs malaria into our face?

2769
01:56:34,475 --> 01:56:35,772
- Jesus.
- Fucking shit.

2770
01:56:37,111 --> 01:56:39,636
- Is that good?
- Oh, yeah.

2771
01:56:39,747 --> 01:56:42,443
Oh, yeah, get in there.

2772
01:56:42,516 --> 01:56:43,608
I could do this all day.

2773
01:56:43,684 --> 01:56:44,810
Cool.

2774
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:48,853
- What was that?
- What the hell was that?

2775
01:56:53,594 --> 01:56:55,858
What's happening?

2776
01:56:55,963 --> 01:56:58,090
Well, boys and girls,
what seems to be the problem?

2777
01:56:58,165 --> 01:57:00,099
- Decels.
- Oh, dear.

2778
01:57:00,167 --> 01:57:03,136
Okay, Allison, I need you to
turn on your back now, okay?

2779
01:57:03,204 --> 01:57:05,764
The baby's heart rate is slowing. Okay?

2780
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:07,467
- It's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

2781
01:57:07,541 --> 01:57:10,135
- It's gonna be fine.'Is it gonna be fine?
- It's gonna be fine. Okay?

2782
01:57:10,211 --> 01:57:14,443
You'll feel a little bit of
a push. You'll feel a little bit of...

2783
01:57:14,515 --> 01:57:16,483
- Oh.
- What are you doing?

2784
01:57:16,550 --> 01:57:20,714
I'm turning the baby so I can take
the pressure off the cord. Okay?

2785
01:57:20,821 --> 01:57:22,982
Oh, my God.

2786
01:57:23,057 --> 01:57:24,217
Okay, we're good.

2787
01:57:24,325 --> 01:57:26,225
The heartbeat's stronger,
but we're not out of the woods.

2788
01:57:26,327 --> 01:57:27,692
We need to get things going now.

2789
01:57:27,795 --> 01:57:30,059
I think the cord is wrapped around the neck.

2790
01:57:30,164 --> 01:57:33,031
So I'm gonna give you some medicine, pop the bag
and get things going, okay?

2791
01:57:33,134 --> 01:57:34,965
I don't wanna leave the baby in there for long,

2792
01:57:35,036 --> 01:57:36,526
and we can give you some medicine for the pain.

2793
01:57:36,637 --> 01:57:38,161
No, no, no, no.

2794
01:57:38,239 --> 01:57:40,571
I don't... I don't want the baby to
be born all drugged out.

2795
01:57:40,641 --> 01:57:41,972
It's not my birth plan.

2796
01:57:42,043 --> 01:57:43,977
Now, things change.
We don't have time to debate this.

2797
01:57:44,045 --> 01:57:47,310
What? No. But no, I'm not
comfortable with that. I'm not.

2798
01:57:47,381 --> 01:57:49,246
No. Would you please just listen to her?

2799
01:57:49,316 --> 01:57:51,409
Fine. Do what you want to do.

2800
01:57:51,485 --> 01:57:53,715
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
- Should I leave?

2801
01:57:53,821 --> 01:57:56,483
Do you want to be the doctor?
Because I really don't need to be here.

2802
01:57:56,557 --> 01:57:59,185
No. What we want is to take a second to talk
about our options, okay?

2803
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:01,353
- That's all we want.
- No. You mean you want to take a second

2804
01:58:01,429 --> 01:58:02,919
to tell me how to do my job.

2805
01:58:03,030 --> 01:58:05,999
My job is to get that baby out safely.

2806
01:58:06,067 --> 01:58:09,400
Or I can go home.
Just let me know. You be the doctor.

2807
01:58:09,503 --> 01:58:11,903
Can we talk outside in the hall for a second?

2808
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:14,098
That woman is a control freak,

2809
01:58:14,208 --> 01:58:16,938
and she needs to let go and let me do my job.

2810
01:58:17,044 --> 01:58:18,341
Look, she's just having a hard time

2811
01:58:18,412 --> 01:58:21,176
because her and our doctor had
a very specific birth plan.

2812
01:58:21,248 --> 01:58:23,773
And they wanted it to be
a very special experience.

2813
01:58:23,884 --> 01:58:26,717
If you want a special experience,
go to a Jimmy Buffett concert.

2814
01:58:26,787 --> 01:58:30,382
We have a new birth plan.
Get the baby out safely.

2815
01:58:30,458 --> 01:58:35,521
Look, man, will you help us out?
I have no idea what I'm doing.

2816
01:58:35,596 --> 01:58:39,589
You can be as big a dick to me
as you want. Just be nice to her, man.

2817
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:42,635
That's all I ask.
Just please be nice to her.

2818
01:58:48,876 --> 01:58:50,207
Are you okay?

2819
01:58:50,277 --> 01:58:52,142
I think so.

2820
01:58:52,213 --> 01:58:54,204
I'm sorry. Let's start fresh.

2821
01:58:54,281 --> 01:58:55,805
Thank you, man. Thanks.

2822
01:58:55,916 --> 01:58:59,215
This is healthy. This is good.
I think we're bonding.

2823
01:59:06,927 --> 01:59:12,456
Allison, I apologize for being
a little brash, but if you're okay with it,

2824
01:59:12,566 --> 01:59:14,227
it's rather important we break the bag

2825
01:59:14,301 --> 01:59:16,565
and give you some medicine to speed things up.

2826
01:59:16,637 --> 01:59:20,573
Because once the bag is broken,
I don't want there to be an infection.

2827
01:59:20,641 --> 01:59:23,132
Whatever.
Do what you have to do.

2828
01:59:26,747 --> 01:59:30,342
Oh, my God.
What a nightmare that guy is.

2829
01:59:30,451 --> 01:59:32,749
I know, I know.
Look, I talked to him.

2830
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:35,516
I think he'll be more cool now.

2831
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:40,491
I'm so sorry I broke up with you.

2832
01:59:41,362 --> 01:59:43,023
You really don't need to be.

2833
01:59:43,130 --> 01:59:46,293
And, you know, I knew
you'd give me another shot.

2834
01:59:47,701 --> 01:59:50,795
I figured it'd be a lot sooner
than this, you know?

2835
01:59:50,871 --> 01:59:54,170
I was just in such a panic from all of this.

2836
01:59:54,275 --> 01:59:58,541
And watching Debbie and Pete together, it's...

2837
01:59:58,646 --> 02:00:00,705
- And my ass got so fat.
- No, no.

2838
02:00:00,814 --> 02:00:02,111
It did.

2839
02:00:02,183 --> 02:00:05,641
I just never, for one minute,
thought that the guy who got me pregnant

2840
02:00:05,719 --> 02:00:08,517
would actually be the right guy for me.

2841
02:00:09,023 --> 02:00:10,718
- Me, either.
- I guess he is.

2842
02:00:10,824 --> 02:00:11,882
Yeah.

2843
02:00:14,895 --> 02:00:17,159
All right, Martin, who am I?

2844
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:21,885
'People think I'm smart because

2845
02:00:21,985 --> 02:00:24,228
I speak in a robot voice.'

2846
02:00:24,338 --> 02:00:25,896
Stephen Hawking.

2847
02:00:26,006 --> 02:00:30,875
'I fuck my nurse with my ever-expanding cock.'

2848
02:00:33,814 --> 02:00:35,247
All right.
Let's murderball.

2849
02:00:35,349 --> 02:00:37,909
Come here!
I'm gonna murderball you!

2850
02:00:38,018 --> 02:00:39,246
- Stay down!
- Jonah, you shithead!

2851
02:00:41,021 --> 02:00:42,147
- Hi.
- Hi.

2852
02:00:42,223 --> 02:00:43,383
Hi.

2853
02:00:43,490 --> 02:00:45,515
I can't believe I go
out of town and this happens.

2854
02:00:45,593 --> 02:00:48,187
- I know.
- I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere.

2855
02:00:48,262 --> 02:00:49,923
- Screw Legoland.
- All right.

2856
02:00:50,030 --> 02:00:52,225
Hey, how do you want this?
You want this over the shoulder?

2857
02:00:52,333 --> 02:00:54,528
You know, I can do whatever
you want. I can get in there.

2858
02:00:54,602 --> 02:00:56,069
Kind of Spike Lee angles.

2859
02:00:56,170 --> 02:00:59,196
No, you can shoot the waiting
room. That would be great.

2860
02:00:59,273 --> 02:01:04,176
Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you.
I've got it from here.

2861
02:01:04,912 --> 02:01:05,970
Debbie.

2862
02:01:06,046 --> 02:01:08,037
Can I talk to you in the hall for a second?

2863
02:01:08,115 --> 02:01:09,275
Why?

2864
02:01:11,418 --> 02:01:15,582
I'd like to be in there
with Allison, without you.

2865
02:01:15,689 --> 02:01:17,020
Okay.

2866
02:01:17,091 --> 02:01:21,528
I understand how you feel
but this isn't up to you.

2867
02:01:21,595 --> 02:01:25,061
Look, Debbie, you are high
off your ass if you think...

2868
02:01:25,161 --> 02:01:26,965
you're coming into that room.

2869
02:01:27,067 --> 02:01:30,059
If you take one step towards
that door, I will tell security

2870
02:01:30,137 --> 02:01:33,538
there's a crazy chick in a pink
dress snatching up babies. Okay?

2871
02:01:33,607 --> 02:01:37,441
So don't even try to come into
that room. That's my room now.

2872
02:01:37,544 --> 02:01:40,707
That little area with the Pepsi
machine, that's your area.

2873
02:01:40,781 --> 02:01:45,480
My room. Your area. Stay in your area.
Stay out of my room.

2874
02:01:45,586 --> 02:01:48,214
Back the fuck off.

2875
02:01:57,398 --> 02:01:59,491
What are you doing here?

2876
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:02,569
He just kicked me out.
He told me to leave.

2877
02:02:04,905 --> 02:02:05,894
Oh.

2878
02:02:06,573 --> 02:02:09,440
But I guess it's good, right?

2879
02:02:09,510 --> 02:02:11,774
He said he's gonna take care of her.

2880
02:02:11,845 --> 02:02:14,245
He really seems on his game.

2881
02:02:14,315 --> 02:02:16,977
I think he's gonna be a good dad.

2882
02:02:17,084 --> 02:02:19,177
I think I like him.

2883
02:02:19,286 --> 02:02:20,685
Thank God.

2884
02:02:23,857 --> 02:02:25,984
I wish I'd gotten that on tape.

2885
02:02:27,328 --> 02:02:30,263
Go! Holy shit, almighty!

2886
02:02:30,331 --> 02:02:32,492
Oh, shit, this really hurts!

2887
02:02:32,599 --> 02:02:34,499
- I see we're well on our way.
- Okay.

2888
02:02:34,601 --> 02:02:36,831
I want the...
I want the epidural. Okay?

2889
02:02:36,937 --> 02:02:38,598
- Give me the epidural!
- Give her the epidural, okay?

2890
02:02:38,672 --> 02:02:40,196
- Give it to her now.
- Okay, Allison.

2891
02:02:40,307 --> 02:02:44,107
We're past the point of an epidural.
Okay? The cervix is fully dilated.

2892
02:02:44,178 --> 02:02:46,018
No, seriously,
I want an epidural!

2893
02:02:46,118 --> 02:02:47,214
I know there's time!

2894
02:02:47,314 --> 02:02:49,305
- We can't give you the epidural.
- Take the time! I...

2895
02:02:49,383 --> 02:02:51,977
I'll make sure it doesn't come out!
I'll stop pushing.

2896
02:02:52,052 --> 02:02:53,212
We have time.
Just do it, please!

2897
02:02:53,287 --> 02:02:54,720
I'll stop.
Please, please, please!

2898
02:02:54,788 --> 02:02:56,221
I'm sorry. We have no time.

2899
02:02:56,323 --> 02:02:58,951
We're gonna just have to do
this the all-natural way, okay?

2900
02:02:59,026 --> 02:03:00,721
The way you wanted to do it.

2901
02:03:00,828 --> 02:03:02,489
- Okay? Ready?
- Okay.

2902
02:03:02,563 --> 02:03:07,023
Here comes another contraction, okay?
I want you to push. Okay, ready?

2903
02:03:08,335 --> 02:03:10,565
- Good, good, good.
- I feel everything!

2904
02:03:10,637 --> 02:03:12,332
Oh, my God! It's happening!

2905
02:03:12,406 --> 02:03:14,806
Okay, maybe we can take it down just a little.

2906
02:03:14,875 --> 02:03:16,638
I think you're gonna scare
the other pregnant women.

2907
02:03:16,710 --> 02:03:18,678
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Okay.

2908
02:03:18,746 --> 02:03:20,077
Are you kidding me?

2909
02:03:22,416 --> 02:03:23,542
Jesus.

2910
02:03:24,551 --> 02:03:26,712
This is messed up.
Something's wrong in there.

2911
02:03:26,820 --> 02:03:28,014
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, no.

2912
02:03:28,088 --> 02:03:29,851
I mean, granted, gynecology's
only a hobby of mine,

2913
02:03:29,923 --> 02:03:32,187
but it sounds to me like she's
crowning. Is that right, Deb?

2914
02:03:32,259 --> 02:03:33,726
Yeah. That's what it sounds like for everyone.

2915
02:03:33,827 --> 02:03:35,488
Everyone goes through this.

2916
02:03:35,562 --> 02:03:39,328
No, I disagree with you.
That sounds terrible.

2917
02:03:41,001 --> 02:03:43,492
I'm gonna go sneak a peak,
see if there's anything I can do.

2918
02:03:48,509 --> 02:03:50,443
Okay! It's crowning!
I'm seeing the head!

2919
02:03:50,511 --> 02:03:51,705
Oh, God.

2920
02:03:51,779 --> 02:03:53,838
- What does it look like, Ben?
- Oh, God.

2921
02:03:53,914 --> 02:03:55,404
- What?
- You don't wanna see it.

2922
02:03:55,516 --> 02:03:57,848
- No, I wanna see it!
- It's beautiful. You don't want to, though.

2923
02:03:57,918 --> 02:04:00,751
No, I want to see it!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

2924
02:04:00,854 --> 02:04:03,448
Okay, we're almost home!
One, two...

2925
02:04:03,557 --> 02:04:05,889
You okay in here? Jesus!

2926
02:04:05,959 --> 02:04:08,189
- Get out!
- Yeah, okay.

2927
02:04:08,262 --> 02:04:09,354
Oh, no!

2928
02:04:12,566 --> 02:04:14,431
You all right, buddy?

2929
02:04:15,536 --> 02:04:16,798
It's okay.

2930
02:04:18,772 --> 02:04:20,000
What did it look like?

2931
02:04:20,073 --> 02:04:21,631
I shouldn't have gone in there.

2932
02:04:21,708 --> 02:04:24,268
Don't go in there.
Promise me you don't go in there.

2933
02:04:24,378 --> 02:04:26,938
Me, go in there? That's the last
fucking place I wanna go.

2934
02:04:27,047 --> 02:04:28,480
Like I'm gonna go in there.

2935
02:04:28,582 --> 02:04:30,209
Try getting a boner now.

2936
02:04:30,284 --> 02:04:31,683
What's up, Deb?

2937
02:04:31,752 --> 02:04:32,844
Hey.

2938
02:04:35,956 --> 02:04:39,722
- Push. One, two, three.
- Oh, God!

2939
02:04:39,793 --> 02:04:43,058
You've passed the shoulders.
One more big push.

2940
02:04:44,765 --> 02:04:46,130
Good.

2941
02:04:51,972 --> 02:04:53,166
I did it.

2942
02:04:53,273 --> 02:04:56,071
- Okay. Oh, my God. It's out.
- You did it. You did it.

2943
02:04:56,143 --> 02:04:58,509
Oh, my God, you did it.
Oh, my God.

2944
02:05:01,815 --> 02:05:03,180
Oh, God.

2945
02:05:05,752 --> 02:05:08,414
- I love you, Ben.
- I love you so much, too.

2946
02:05:08,489 --> 02:05:09,615
Oh, my God.

2947
02:05:09,690 --> 02:05:12,352
- Congratulations, you two. Beautiful.
- Thank you.

2948
02:05:12,459 --> 02:05:15,986
- You did so great. You were amazing.
- Thank you.

2949
02:05:16,096 --> 02:05:18,496
Okay, pretty baby.

2950
02:05:18,565 --> 02:05:20,226
You got out.

2951
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:22,768
You made it out. Welcome.

2952
02:05:24,972 --> 02:05:27,998
You ever get so bored
you just stare at your balls?

2953
02:05:28,108 --> 02:05:30,474
I bet you do, late John Lennon.

2954
02:05:33,146 --> 02:05:34,272
Here we are again.

2955
02:05:34,348 --> 02:05:36,316
Who is that?
Is that Ben's rabbi?

2956
02:05:36,383 --> 02:05:38,544
Is he the one who cuts the penis?

2957
02:05:40,053 --> 02:05:41,987
I think it's Matisyahu.

2958
02:05:43,223 --> 02:05:44,485
Awesome.

2959
02:05:44,558 --> 02:05:46,685
- You want out of the bet?
- I want out of the bet.

2960
02:05:46,793 --> 02:05:51,787
You know what you have to say.
Just say it, man. I think now is the time.

2961
02:05:51,865 --> 02:05:54,459
Jason, you're the master.

2962
02:05:54,535 --> 02:05:55,832
- You heard it, right?
- Yeah.

2963
02:05:55,903 --> 02:05:58,497
All right. You're out of the bet.
Yeah, now you're done.

2964
02:05:58,572 --> 02:06:00,403
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, God.

2965
02:06:00,507 --> 02:06:02,475
Your face smells like an old man's balls.

2966
02:06:02,543 --> 02:06:04,340
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Oh, fucking hell.

2967
02:06:06,246 --> 02:06:07,372
Hey.

2968
02:06:12,152 --> 02:06:14,211
Oh, my God.

2969
02:06:14,321 --> 02:06:16,221
Oh, hello.

2970
02:06:16,323 --> 02:06:18,314
Oh, my goodness.

2971
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:21,591
She's beautiful.

2972
02:06:24,231 --> 02:06:25,823
Hello.

2973
02:06:25,899 --> 02:06:28,697
- Oh. I love you, Ben.
- I love you, Debbie.

2974
02:06:28,769 --> 02:06:32,500
- We're gonna have another baby.
- Okay.

2975
02:06:32,573 --> 02:06:33,904
Hello, baby.

2976
02:06:34,007 --> 02:06:35,998
Gentlemen, it's a girl!

2977
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:42,407
- We got a daughter!
- Mazel tov!

2978
02:06:42,516 --> 02:06:45,280
- Congratulations, Daddy!
- We got a beautiful little girl!

2979
02:06:45,385 --> 02:06:48,377
- Let's meet her! She's awesome!
- A beautiful little girl!

2980
02:06:49,056 --> 02:06:52,219
And then your mommy said,
'Just do it, already,'

2981
02:06:53,093 --> 02:06:55,755
which was very confusing to Daddy.

2982
02:06:55,862 --> 02:06:58,760
So I listened to the most
literal translation of that...

2983
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:00,231
and I just did it, already.

2984
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:02,200
What would you do?

2985
02:07:02,269 --> 02:07:03,896
Don't tell Mommy,

2986
02:07:03,971 --> 02:07:08,203
but it was the smartest thing I ever did,
listening to her, 'cause now you're here.

2987
02:07:08,275 --> 02:07:11,005
Isn't that nice?
I think it is.

2988
02:07:16,917 --> 02:07:18,248
Hi, you.

2989
02:07:22,389 --> 02:07:24,550
I hope your apartment is big enough
for the three of us.

2990
02:07:24,625 --> 02:07:26,115
Oh, it definitely is.

2991
02:07:26,226 --> 02:07:29,093
That's why I got one in East LA,
the rent. It's huge!

2992
02:07:29,162 --> 02:07:30,459
The only thing is we have to decide

2993
02:07:30,564 --> 02:07:32,930
if we're gonna be Crips
or Bloods before we get there.

2994
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,468
- Well, I look good in red.
- I look good in blue.

2995
02:07:35,569 --> 02:07:36,866
The fighting continues.

2996
02:07:38,338 --> 02:07:40,465
We could just throw off everyone
and become Latin Kings.

2997
02:07:40,574 --> 02:07:41,666
Yeah.

2998
02:07:41,775 --> 02:07:42,969
We both look good in gold.

2999
02:07:43,043 --> 02:07:44,374
Yeah.

3000
02:07:45,412 --> 02:07:46,674
Good choice.

3001
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:50,307
I would yell at you about driving
so slow, except the baby's here.

3002
02:07:50,417 --> 02:07:53,853
No, these guys can honk all they want.
I ain't going faster than 12.

3003
02:07:53,954 --> 02:07:55,979
It might take us around three
hours to get home, though.
