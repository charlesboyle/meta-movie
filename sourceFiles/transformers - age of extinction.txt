1
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,653
Oh, shit. Darcy, you really
shouldn't have come.

2
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,034
Show me.

3
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,668
Corporate was adamant.
We keep running.

4
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,878
No stopping operations.

5
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,923
No, no, no. You got to
go through. No cameras.

6
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,007
He's got orders to kill.

7
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,592
I don't even think international
laws apply up here.

8
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,220
We are geologists first.

9
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,597
If this thing has any
historical significance at all,

10
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,767
we are shutting down.
I'm shutting us down.

11
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,688
Oh, he's going to
shoot me? Shoot me.

12
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,390
Hey, don't kill her.

13
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,525
This is crazy stuff.

14
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,695
Crazy shit.

15
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,624
Well, what do you think?

16
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,706
I think history is about to change.

17
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,333
<i>I'm a nasty woman</i>

18
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,332
Oh, look who decided
to show up for work.

19
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,341
<i>I'm a heartbreaker</i>

20
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,761
<i>Gonna make you cry</i>

21
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,391
What, surf report no
good at South Padre?

22
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:31,392
The waves are flat and I got
no gas. You know that, Cade.

23
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,524
Dude. Rude.

24
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,778
Look at these two junebugs.
Whoo! My, my!

25
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,571
Hey, you're paying me
on this one, right, Cade?

26
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,864
Please tell me I'm getting paid.

27
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,408
You know, Lucas, a lot of guys are
just happy to have a job at all.

28
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,743
Yeah, I suppose.

29
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,077
- You got any cash on you?
- Yeah.

30
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,779
All right, good.

31
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,376
Hey, Lucas Flannery.

32
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,009
Place has been in
the family since '28.

33
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,346
Granddaddy ran it all his life.
Ain't that right, Granddaddy?

34
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,890
Real soon he's going
to sign it over to me.

35
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,810
The movies nowadays,
that's the trouble.

36
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,354
Sequels and remakes, bunch of crap.

37
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,731
I love that one. Oh.

38
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,441
He's deaf and senile.

39
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,068
Heard that.

40
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,903
Now these just need
some spit and polish.

41
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,989
I believe they're
digital, possibly IMAX.

42
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,074
Yeah, they're not.

43
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,409
Mister, we'll have a look around if
you want to leave us to it, okay?

44
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,495
You know, folks used to
come from miles around

45
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,832
to see the dancing girls
with the big cha-chas.

46
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,916
I swear to God

47
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,210
I am one diaper change away
from poisoning his oatmeal.

48
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,586
Hey, you hang in there, buddy.

49
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,796
If coming here makes you feel young,

50
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,589
then you tell this kid to
bring you here every day.

51
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,341
Seven bucks, I keep talking.

52
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,592
Sold.

53
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,930
Remember this place
when we were kids?

54
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:51,305
How many girls you think you
brought here in high school?

55
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,223
I only remember one.

56
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,354
Hey, heads!

57
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,855
Ow!

58
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,449
That's why you didn't
make the varsity team.

59
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,076
Ah.

60
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,121
All right. Go long.

61
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,003
Leave it.

62
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,193
Mortar shells?

63
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,521
What the hell happened to you?

64
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,450
Hey, snakeballs.
How much for the truck?

65
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,994
Truck?

66
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,345
Two more weeks, girls,
till no more classes, ever.

67
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,139
Almost time to get a
tan and get wasted!

68
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,417
Please, please.

69
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,128
No financial aid. Great.

70
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,518
Yes, I know I'm home, thank you.

71
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,521
<i>Intruder alert!
Back away from the premises!</i>

72
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,190
- Voice recognition. It's me!
<i>- I am dialing 911.</i>

73
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,026
Go right ahead. I don't care.

74
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,320
<i>I'm still calling 911.</i>

75
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,947
<i>The Battle of Chicago was an event</i>

76
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,740
<i>that permanently changed our world.</i>

77
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,783
<i>Over 1,300 dead.</i>

78
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,284
<i>Much of the city has been destroyed.</i>

79
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,370
<i>Homeland Security is urging everyone</i>

80
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,789
<i>to report suspicious alien activity.</i>

81
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,292
<i>A swift act of Congress</i>

82
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,420
<i>put an end to all joint operations</i>

83
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:28,424
<i>between the military and the
Autobots, ending the alliance.</i>

84
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,718
<i>As this committee knows,
the Invasion of Chicago</i>

85
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,595
<i>was a defining day for
our nation five years ago.</i>

86
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,223
The day millions of
people realized that

87
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,935
never again can we allow aliens
to fight our battles for us.

88
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,772
A handful of Autobots
were given sanctuary

89
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,442
after joint-combat
operations were abolished.

90
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,903
Fewer than a dozen Decepticons
are still on the run

91
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,026
thanks to our CIA unit,

92
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,216
"Cemetery Wind."

93
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,618
As for the alien technology,

94
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,787
our objective remains to
keep it in American control.

95
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,622
<i>Hi. My name is Timothy.
This is my crew.</i>

96
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,125
<i>We found this alien
ball turret in Chicago.</i>

97
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,586
<i>We just found it in the
rubble and it's all working...</i>

98
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,421
Word has it Japan, India,

99
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,632
the Israelis may have gotten
their hands on a couple of ships.

100
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,801
Apparently the Russians
are starting a bidding war.

101
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:17,177
<i>We're taking $5, 000 for it.
It's got 36 guns, alien shit.</i>

102
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,183
A new era has begun.

103
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:23,184
And the age of the
Transformers is over.

104
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,501
Hey.

105
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,330
<i>Hey, I've been waiting for you.</i>

106
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,798
<i>You're looking hot today!</i>

107
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,519
Oh, yeah? How about
you take your shirt off?

108
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,469
<i>You want me to take
my shirt off right now?</i>

109
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,720
<i>What would your dad think of that?</i>

110
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,138
- What the hell?
<i>- Hey, where you going?</i>

111
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,841
I cannot believe him.
I cannot believe this.

112
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,478
What the hell?

113
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,556
All the way!

114
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,610
A truck?

115
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,571
Dad, please tell me you didn't
spend our money on this.

116
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,240
Oh, no, don't worry, he didn't.
He spent my money.

117
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,574
A hundred and fifty bucks of it.

118
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,451
As an advance on your
regular paycheck.

119
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,703
- What regular paycheck?
- Which you will get back.

120
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,413
- When?
- Never. We're broke.

121
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,498
I knew it.

122
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,458
Sweetheart, could you
please not drive a wedge

123
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,918
between employer and employee.

124
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,753
Hold on. I thought we were partners.

125
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,713
Look, I came up short, okay?
I had to buy her a prom dress.

126
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,257
You want me to deny
her a prom dress?

127
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,800
You might as well.
You denied her a prom date.

128
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,969
No, I offered to take
her and chaperone.

129
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,888
Nobody wants to go to the
dance with their dad. It's weird.

130
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,265
It's not the issue.

131
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,724
Well, maybe it should be.

132
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,059
Hey, could you guys
just get off my case?

133
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,727
You know what the
engine on this runs for?

134
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,187
I can break it down and
strip it for parts.

135
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,399
And sweetheart, your shorts are
shrinking by the second, okay?

136
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,443
Cold water, air dry, please.

137
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,821
I think she looks hot.

138
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,239
What did you say?

139
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,782
Like a hot teenager.

140
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,326
Oh, it's the "teenager" thing
that makes it better. Thank you.

141
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,370
It didn't sound like what it meant.

142
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,697
That goes by the circuit boards.

143
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,838
Put the Zeiss lenses over there.

144
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,799
Dad, please. You can't keep
spending money on junk

145
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,676
just so you can turn
it into different junk.

146
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,761
We do not use the "J" word in here.

147
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,264
That is a Super Simplex
theater projector. It's very rare.

148
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,600
What about the SmilePilot?

149
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,352
Or the Exer-Mower that I invented?
Simply ahead of their time.

150
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,230
Yeah, like the alleged Guard-Dawg.

151
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,017
You're gonna get him upset.

152
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,944
Hey, Cade! Cade!

153
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,279
This thing still work?

154
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,363
- No!
- Yes.

155
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,615
Yes, and still groundbreaking.

156
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,320
Go back there and lay on the recliner
and just wait for a cold one.

157
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,832
Dude, stop breaking stuff.

158
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,503
Final notice, late notice, past due.

159
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,001
Come on, come on.

160
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,382
Bring Daddy the alcohol. Come on.

161
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,135
I mean, what is all this
crap people send you?

162
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,509
That's a Discman and
that's an 8-track tape.

163
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,140
- Music.
- Never heard of it.

164
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,644
Look, I fix that, it's 100 bucks.
I fix that, it's $250.

165
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,146
If I would have been able to fix
that before you broke it even more,

166
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,231
it would have been 20 bucks.

167
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,732
This stuff is what's gonna
put you through college,

168
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,984
as long as you land one
of those scholarships.

169
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,188
What's the estimated time
of arrival, usually? Average?

170
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,867
Wait. So it just brings
the beer near you?

171
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,244
That's the trick?

172
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,496
- It's got a couple kinks, man.
- Yeah.

173
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,332
Dad, you think maybe some
things should never be invented?

174
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,750
No, I don't.
That's backwards thinking.

175
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,628
This is a temple of technology.
You guys are standing in a holy place.

176
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,340
What do you think?
Why don't you look at all of this?

177
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,509
This could be yours.
What about this land?

178
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,512
Purple People Eater's back
and she looks hungry.

179
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,264
Isn't this incredible?

180
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,890
- I knew you would like it.
- Hey, you!

181
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,763
Hey.

182
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,978
I own this house! It's not for sale!

183
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,188
Six months late on
payments, Mr. Yeager.

184
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,274
And I see you stealing
power at the pole.

185
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,900
Hey, that's not your concern.

186
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,735
- Sir, do you wanna see the property?
- Sure.

187
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,487
I'd be more than happy
to give you a tour.

188
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,072
I'll show you three other
buyers I got buried out back,

189
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,615
then I'll crack your
head open like an egg!

190
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,117
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Stay back! He's crazy.

191
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,576
I told you don't come
back here anymore.

192
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,953
I will have my brother come
back and beat your ass!

193
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,579
- Don't you start with me.
- Why don't you do it yourself?

194
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,956
And I'll bring the police
when I come, too!

195
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,417
- My brother ain't no joke!
- Who, Jerry?

196
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,626
You bring his big ass up here,

197
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,379
he's gonna be huffing and puffing
before he can squeeze out of that car!

198
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,923
You back out on my grass,
you're gonna be in big trouble!

199
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,844
You tell Jerry to come see me.
I'll give him some pecan pie.

200
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,346
Hey!

201
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,059
She smashed through the fence?

202
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,146
Cade, relax. You're going
to have an aortic infarction.

203
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,272
What is that?

204
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,982
I think it's a brain heart attack.

205
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,567
Yeah, I've had one already.

206
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,776
So we're stealing power now?

207
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,403
No, we're borrowing it
from the neighbors.

208
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,905
Great. That's awesome.

209
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,491
Once I graduate and I'm gone,
who's gonna take care of you?

210
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,410
Oh, you take care of me?

211
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,488
Who taught you how
to solder a circuit?

212
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,456
Or write a program?
Or French braid your hair?

213
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,583
Or throw a spiral? Me.
That's what I do.

214
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,251
Who taught you how to
cook without ketchup,

215
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,579
or balance your checkbook?

216
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,376
Who always has to be the
grownup around here?

217
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,679
All right, you got a point, okay?
But that means we're a great team.

218
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,806
And I know it's been sucky
around here lately.

219
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,851
But we're gonna be fine, sweetie.
You just gotta keep believing, okay?

220
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,269
I mean, that's what
great inventors do.

221
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,941
I promise you, one day, I'm gonna
build something that matters.

222
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,395
I believe you, Dad.

223
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,361
You know, your mom would
be very proud of you.

224
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,826
It's going to be okay.

225
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,359
Spread out! Push right!

226
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,652
Roll, roll, roll, roll.

227
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,487
Give me two. Give me two.

228
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,861
Take the beach, nice and easy.

229
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,011
<i>All right, hold what you got.</i>

230
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,322
Release the mini-drones.

231
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,807
<i>Vipers. Eagle in sight. Cleared hot.</i>

232
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,937
Got a heat sig. Second stack.
Closest to the bow.

233
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,398
<i>Predator 0-1. Captured target area.</i>

234
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,601
<i>Set charges.</i>

235
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:51,992
Leader, leader, this is Gunfighter 0-1.
Eagles moving internal. Second deck.

236
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,406
Frogman 83, Frogman 83.

237
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,145
Breached site on rooftop.

238
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,731
- Breached site on rooftop.
- Have Echo Platoon on standby.

239
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,935
Let the helo know we're
moving external!

240
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,406
<i>Alpha, take port.
Bravo, take starboard.</i>

241
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,116
<i>Shift right. Shift right.</i>

242
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,866
Cracking steel!

243
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,796
No!

244
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,340
Hit him, hit him, hit him!

245
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,178
Fire.

246
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,007
<i>Missiles out. Danger close.</i>

247
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,268
He's running! Move!

248
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,471
<i>He's on the run! He's on the run!</i>

249
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,491
No! Please!

250
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,490
Hold your fire.

251
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,919
Hold! Hold fire!

252
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,588
Can you not see? I've been injured.

253
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,007
<i>Box him in. Box him in.</i>

254
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:35,258
Medical Officer Ratchet!
I'm a friend!

255
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,891
I'm an Autobot!

256
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,810
Then why are you running?

257
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,479
<i>Optimus sent this distress message.</i>

258
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,398
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

259
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,735
<i>We are under targeted attack.
Cease all contact with humans.</i>

260
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,990
We're all hiding.
All Autobots are being hunted.

261
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,863
We're all in danger.

262
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,077
I lost a sister in Chicago.

263
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,371
You'll get no sympathy from me.

264
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,221
What's wrong with you humans?

265
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,805
No! Please.

266
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,233
Check fire, check fire!

267
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,158
He's mine now.

268
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,127
Lockdown.

269
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,963
Autobots, Decepticons.

270
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,468
Like little children,
always fighting.

271
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,429
Making a mess out of the universe.

272
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,973
Then I've got to clean it up.

273
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,351
There is one way you survive.

274
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,269
Tell me where he's hiding.

275
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,270
Where is Optimus Prime?

276
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,068
Never.

277
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:24,200
Never is here.

278
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,755
I must say, it is remarkable,

279
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,341
really astounding,
the success that the CIA has had

280
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,259
since you have taken
operational control,

281
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,471
and so the President has
asked me to ask you

282
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,515
to ask him,

283
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,433
to invite you both

284
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,769
over to the White
House just to powwow,

285
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,524
where we get maybe some
more specifics about how

286
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,695
exactly you're hunting the
enemy Decepticons left.

287
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,446
I've had my desk for two years.

288
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,865
Mr. Attinger has been here for 25.

289
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,494
He runs the projects where
I don't ask for specifics.

290
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,621
That's why they're called Black Ops.

291
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,040
And why we all sleep
better at night.

292
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,835
Check. That is great. So, um...

293
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,962
Any dirt on that? Uh,
how, uh, that's going?

294
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,885
Outstanding.

295
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,095
Great. Oh, great.

296
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,972
I was hoping to hear that.
The President will be pleased.

297
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:28,476
'Cause, I'll tell you right now, I've only
been Chief of Staff since Monday, um,

298
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,938
but I do know that the alien
war stuff, these are...

299
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,274
These are the only fun meetings.

300
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,526
Look, I'm not here to
entertain the President,

301
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:40,731
but you may tell him that
the war will be over.

302
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,482
Soon.

303
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,910
"...be over..." In case he asks,
I just like to have an exact quote.

304
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,663
"War will be over soon."
That is great. Such good news.

305
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:53,042
And, um, the President
would, I know, just love...

306
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,336
Really, really love
to press the flesh...

307
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,048
Not flesh, obviously, but just
maybe get a shot with, um...

308
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,550
Is it Lord Prime? Sir Prime?

309
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,427
We could bop on Air Force One.

310
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,179
It'd be just a quick bop,
then we just bop in and bop back.

311
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,388
I wouldn't get his
hopes up on that one.

312
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,514
Okay.

313
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,516
He's called Optimus Prime.

314
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,061
Alien combatant. Here illegally.

315
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:16,357
But aren't they our friends? Why?

316
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,486
Because our world will
never truly be safe

317
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,313
till all of them are gone.

318
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:25,700
Oh. Well, I would hope we could do
a much more ceremonial farewell.

319
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,621
Especially since our military has
worked so closely with them.

320
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,539
- Until you.
- It's not their planet.

321
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,662
Never was.

322
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,920
Time we take it back.

323
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:50,801
All right, come on. Come on.

324
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,812
Yes. Yes.

325
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,810
Yes.

326
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,732
Oh, there you go.

327
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,275
No, hold it.

328
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,237
Stop shaking! Why are you shaking?

329
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,985
You have the job!

330
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,241
You forgot to eat dinner!

331
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,779
You see why I worry?

332
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,458
Look, sorry, sweetie, I...

333
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,794
I almost got it working right.

334
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:21,381
So, listen, I'm done with
homework and set with finals,

335
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,967
so I was just gonna take a
little drive with some friends

336
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,802
if that was okay with you.

337
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:29,597
No boys, I know. Graduate first.

338
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,470
Exactly.

339
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,143
You do know no one else
has this rule, right?

340
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,397
Rule? Don't make it sound
harsh, okay. It's wisdom.

341
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,774
I don't think we need to be driving
around in the middle of the night.

342
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,943
It's already like quarter
to eight. It's almost dark.

343
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,237
Spud, will you stop it?

344
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,656
You know where I was
for my graduation?

345
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,200
Yes. With me, the mistake.

346
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,120
The surprise, Tess. And the
best thing that ever happened.

347
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:56,496
Do we look unhappy? Huh? No.
It's the greatest day of my life.

348
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,294
I made your mother a
promise before she passed.

349
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,623
Our baby's gonna be at
her graduation. That's it.

350
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,134
High school boys know nothing.
It's only later they turn into men.

351
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,088
So if you were older and
wiser, I wouldn't exist.

352
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,306
That's not what I meant.

353
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,974
You know, this is a
non-dating household, okay?

354
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,302
You don't date,
I don't date. That's it.

355
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,554
Well, maybe you should.

356
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,273
Tessa, wait.

357
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,438
Tessa?

358
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,145
Look.

359
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:28,357
I know I've been on you,
okay? But I have to be.

360
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,284
Twelve to seventeen is the
official teenage danger window.

361
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:36,206
It's my job to get you through it.
So you can be pissed off all you want.

362
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:43,171
And, yes, you can take
a ride with your friends.

363
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,589
Okay.

364
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,341
Don't work all night.

365
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,385
And eat.

366
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,696
Best thing that ever
happened, Emily.

367
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,574
She's the best thing
that ever happened.

368
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,902
You'd be proud.

369
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,909
Oh, no.

370
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,927
Unbelievable.

371
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,555
Unbelievable. God!

372
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,437
Something in here needs to
make this family some money.

373
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,276
Come on, you old wreck.

374
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,445
Judgment Day.

375
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,626
Where is he?

376
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,294
I don't know.

377
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:09,257
<i>Intruder alert! Intruder alert!</i>

378
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,425
<i>Asshole.</i>

379
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,800
<i>I am dialing 911.</i>

380
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,765
Tess, I'm basically your uncle.
<i>Su casa es mi casa.</i>

381
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,934
And we're going to lose the <i>casa.</i>

382
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,352
Dad!

383
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,396
Coming!

384
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:27,108
Are you working with lasers?
If so, I'm not coming in.

385
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,526
You guys have never seen
a truck like this before.

386
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,111
Get in here. Lock that door.

387
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,280
It doesn't have a lock.

388
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,907
Look! Look at the hole in the radiator.
Look at the size of it.

389
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,284
Something blew a hole in it!

390
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,452
Yeah, so?

391
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,828
It's not normal steel.

392
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,706
The shrapnel in the engine,
it ripped all the connections apart.

393
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,292
And watch. And this
took some Cade genius.

394
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,377
You are gonna love this.

395
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,331
When I hook this back
to a working battery...

396
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,968
<i>Calling all...</i>

397
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,137
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

398
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,638
Oh, yeah.

399
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,891
I don't think it's a truck at all.

400
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,726
I think we just found a Transformer.

401
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,436
Tran... Ugh!

402
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:06,060
- Evacuate!
- Wait! Guys!

403
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,900
Dad, are you out of your mind?
You need to get that thing out of here.

404
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,152
You don't have to worry. I've been
in there working all night. I'm fine.

405
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,695
You know what? That's not
a truck, okay? You're right.

406
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,405
It's an alien killing machine.

407
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,823
- Dude. It's DOA.
- Jesus.

408
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,366
It's been recalled, totaled, done.

409
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,951
So, listen, there's a
number that you call.

410
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,622
You're supposed to call the government.
It's the American thing to do.

411
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,457
- Here we go.
- You're supposed to call,

412
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,958
and if it ends up being alien,

413
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,418
then you win $25,000.

414
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,586
You don't win money.

415
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,837
And if you can capture it live...

416
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,924
Like tag it like a wild wildebeest,
then you get $100,000.

417
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,509
- Dad, we're making the call.
- I heard that.

418
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,969
I've seen the commercial. They don't
say that. That's not a guarantee.

419
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,554
You think Greg would lie to me?

420
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,598
Look, if that's a Transformer
there from the Battle of Chicago,

421
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,183
I need to know how it works.

422
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,936
I'm an inventor. This could
be a game changer for me!

423
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,854
If I can apply that
technology to my inventions,

424
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,523
we'd never have to worry
about money again.

425
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,692
I've heard that before.

426
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,527
Twenty-five grand!
It pays for my college.

427
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,237
It pays for the house.

428
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,863
Besides, you used my money
to buy the truck, right?

429
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:59,488
So technically, that's my truck.
Don't you think?

430
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,037
You also signed a contract
regarding all research lab I.P.

431
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,911
Research lab? It's a barn, dude.

432
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,378
You signed it and now
you're competing.

433
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,381
Any idea of yours is mine.
Any thought you have, I own it,

434
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,216
so basically, I own you.

435
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,343
I don't think you can own someone.

436
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,217
That was, like, a while ago,
even in Texas.

437
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,057
All right. Bring the torch over
and help me with the pulley arm.

438
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,186
I think the shrapnel
took out its power core.

439
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,060
Oh, and, Tessa, you see this?

440
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,610
Would an alien killing
machine let me do that?

441
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,028
Look, I'll make the call.

442
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,573
We'll get the money.
Just first let me see if I'm right.

443
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,158
You want to hide in
the house? Go ahead.

444
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,860
Okay.

445
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,908
Let's go. Pulley arm.

446
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,621
I can't believe him!

447
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,627
What is that? Looks like a missile.

448
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,545
It is! Whoa!

449
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,561
Dad!

450
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:11,606
There's a missile
in the family room!

451
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,309
Holy...

452
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,113
I'll kill you!

453
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,786
No! No!

454
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,290
Dad, there's a missile in...

455
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,422
I'll kill you! Stay back!

456
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,751
- Oh, no. Don't shoot. Don't shoot!
- Call 911! Run!

457
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,928
- Lucas!
- Stop!

458
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,010
Lucas? Don't move, just calm down.

459
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,352
Easy, human.

460
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,063
Stay there. He's not
going to hurt us.

461
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,153
Weapons systems damaged.

462
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,151
A missile hit your engine.

463
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,742
And we took it out of you.
You're hurt really bad.

464
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,954
I'm just trying to help you.

465
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,413
You're in my home now.
I'm an engineer.

466
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,624
My name is Cade Yeager.

467
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:15,420
Cade, I am in your debt.

468
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:19,340
My name is Optimus Prime.

469
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,968
My Autobots.

470
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,342
They're in danger.

471
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,806
I need to go. I need to go now.

472
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,225
How far you think you're gonna get?

473
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,603
Tessa, come here. He needs our help.

474
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,318
What happened to you?

475
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:44,031
An ambush. A trap. Set by humans.

476
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,413
I escaped and took this form.

477
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,456
But you're on our side.

478
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,083
Why would humans hurt you?

479
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:57,545
They were not alone.

480
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:02,501
- My Autobots can repair me.
- Yeah.

481
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,466
If you can reach 'em.

482
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,436
What about me?

483
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,789
I warn you, Mr. Attinger of Earth,

484
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,756
an alliance is a contract,
and contracts,

485
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,175
like humans,

486
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,801
expire.

487
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,596
On this planet, we have a saying.

488
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,307
"The enemy of my
enemy is my friend."

489
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,267
I also have a saying.

490
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,062
"I don't care."

491
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,065
So what happened in Mexico City?

492
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,149
I thought you had him.

493
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:05,481
Three direct hits. A mortal wound.
Then your men allowed him to escape.

494
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,199
You promised me human intelligence.

495
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,160
Or is there such a thing?

496
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,863
You know, you've
still never told me.

497
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,706
Why do you want him?

498
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,416
Who are you working for?

499
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:22,338
Every galaxy I've traveled,
all you species are the same.

500
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:26,543
You all think you're the
center of the universe.

501
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,217
You have no idea.

502
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,140
Go to the hardware store
and you get the list.

503
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,183
The whole list.

504
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,309
What, you're going
to try and fix him?

505
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,685
He's not a model train set, Cade.

506
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,229
No, that's right. He's important.

507
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,438
Yeah, but important to who?

508
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,440
You can't keep an alien
locked up in your barn.

509
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,650
What are you gonna
do, play with him?

510
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,026
- Will you calm down?
- I'm trying to,

511
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,487
but I just got hit in the head
with a ten-foot cannon!

512
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,406
If he eats you, I get the GTO.

513
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,990
Not a word to anybody.
Do you hear me?

514
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,283
Not a single word.

515
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,156
<i>Nobody.</i>

516
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,955
I think we have a lock
on a high-value target.

517
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,838
Special Operations group is ready.

518
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,922
What do you got?

519
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,925
Sir, Special Ops just got
a call from Paris, Texas.

520
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,177
Hard match on the truck
seen leaving Mexico City.

521
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,131
Son of a bitch. Let's go get him.

522
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,103
Took a hell of a hit, you know.

523
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,806
The missile just missed
your power source.

524
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,108
We call it a Spark.

525
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:29,030
It contains our life
force and our memories.

526
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,114
Yeah, we call it a soul.

527
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,202
Scramble Cemetery Wind.

528
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,872
Thank you for your efforts,
ladies and gentlemen.

529
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,995
This room is going dark.

530
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,251
The exit is on your left.

531
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,920
- I'll take it from here.
- Okay, let's go.

532
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,549
I'm with Cemetery Wind.
We're on the move.

533
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,002
<i>Repeat, on the move.</i>

534
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,354
Cade.

535
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,774
Why are you willing to help me?

536
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:09,065
I guess maybe because
you trust me to.

537
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,754
I'm back!

538
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,422
Took you long enough!

539
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,090
My head hurts.
I had to go to the doctor.

540
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,800
I got a welt on my head

541
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,303
that makes me look like a
fricking Star Trek character.

542
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,051
Whatever.

543
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,900
Look! Look!

544
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,541
<i>We're on property.</i>

545
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,001
<i>Viper 15 overhead. Angels 1.</i>

546
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,467
Dad!

547
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,603
Mr. Yeager, my name's James Savoy.
I'm a federal agent.

548
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:09,979
My men and I are trying to
track down an abandoned truck.

549
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,531
It's a nice spread you got here.
Too bad she's for sale.

550
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,404
Well, thanks. She's not.

551
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,654
That the truck you mean?

552
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,205
Afraid not.

553
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,583
You know, Mr. Yeager,
we received a call from someone

554
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,209
concerned about this truck.

555
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,502
Oh, no.

556
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,375
That wasn't you?

557
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,673
Only thing I'm concerned about
is you being on my property

558
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,924
without permission.

559
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:39,053
You know, we got a rule about people
messing with people from Texas.

560
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,888
And I don't know what
truck you're talking about.

561
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,307
The kind that cost American lives.

562
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,725
Search the property!

563
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:45,893
What do you mean,
"Search the property"?

564
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,102
You don't have a warrant.

565
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,805
My face is my warrant.

566
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,859
Wait. But if you guys do find a
truck, we get a reward, right?

567
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,195
<i>Viper 15 holding, point alpha.</i>

568
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,243
<i>Charlie team, hold tight.</i>

569
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,870
<i>Lock it down.</i>

570
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,831
- Open, open, open.
- Short wall. Short wall.

571
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,249
Five in. Five in.

572
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,669
<i>Intruder alert!
Back away from the premises.</i>

573
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,921
- What the hell is that?
- Just some dumb inventor.

574
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:14,963
Clear.

575
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,590
Clear.

576
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,425
Clear right.

577
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,593
Clear.

578
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,717
360. 720. Heads on a swivel.

579
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:34,483
Let's go. There's nothing here.

580
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,656
There's no signs. We got nothing.

581
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,200
Sir, we have a live armed
missile in the trash.

582
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:48,407
Live? I carried that to the trash!
You told me that was a dud, dude.

583
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,075
I could be dead. Right?

584
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,711
Look. Okay, yes,
I found a truck, all right.

585
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,003
I towed it back for the parts.

586
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,880
I left it here last night.
This morning, it's gone.

587
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,298
When? Where? I don't know.
I swear to God.

588
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,967
That's as much as I know about him.

589
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,840
"Him."

590
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,801
He said, "Him."

591
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,008
<i>He knows who the son of a bitch is.</i>

592
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,602
- Mr. Yeager.
- What?

593
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,395
Excuse me.

594
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,350
You just said, "Him."

595
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,436
- Take them down.
- What?

596
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,571
Ow! Let me go!

597
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,616
They don't know about the truck!
I know! Just let her go.

598
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,993
What kind of a man betrays
his flesh-and-blood

599
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,953
brethren for alien metal?

600
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,204
- Get this guy out of my sight.
- Get off!

601
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,081
Let her go! They don't
know about the truck.

602
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,624
All right! Load up!
Search the perimeter!

603
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,626
Lucas, you called, didn't you?

604
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,337
No! I don't know any
of these scary guys.

605
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,840
Oh, God! You're manhandling
a woman! I'll kick your ass!

606
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,043
Let her go!

607
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,678
- Daddy! Let me go!
- You're not going anywhere.

608
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,513
Daddy!

609
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,511
No! You're not taking me anywhere!

610
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,555
I'm an American!

611
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,352
- Easy, sweetheart.
- Okay, okay, okay.

612
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,105
All right. Okay.
All right. I was wrong.

613
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,108
Savoy. Use the girl.

614
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,152
Oh, my God! Ahh!

615
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,744
Now, you got ten seconds.
Where's the truck?

616
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:14,374
- You're gonna shoot my little girl?
- If I have to.

617
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,584
Please don't shoot me! Please!

618
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,003
Look, I don't know. I told you
everything that I know! He's gone.

619
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,963
He left. He was in the
barn, I swear to God!

620
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,049
<i>- Just let her go!
- Ow!</i>

621
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,592
Please, please.

622
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:25,636
He was in there! Let her go!

623
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,012
Seven seconds.

624
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,224
I'm telling you the truth!
He was in there!

625
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,519
Dad!

626
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,769
Tell him to get away
from my little girl now!

627
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,358
Dad!

628
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,356
You touch her and I'll kill you!

629
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,738
You got two seconds.

630
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,156
I need the truth.

631
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,408
- Please.
- Shoot her.

632
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,758
Here I am!

633
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,597
- Get down!
- Ahh!

634
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:15,769
Cade! They're going to
kill you! Get out of here!

635
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,784
Push right! Headed to the house!

636
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,590
Come on. Hurry up! Get in the car!

637
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,338
- Let's go!
- Daddy, get in the car!

638
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,390
Perimeter, Optimus moving your way!

639
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,458
What's happening, baby?
Who are they?

640
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,002
It's the truck. They want the truck!

641
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,797
"Who are they"? Who are you,
and who are you calling "baby"?

642
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,298
I know you heard me.

643
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,050
- I'm her boyfriend!
- He's my boyfriend!

644
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,719
What? You're not her boyfriend!

645
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,673
His name's Shane and he drives, Dad.

646
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,934
What kind of cars are those?
They're so scary!

647
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,102
There's another one
coming up the back!

648
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,856
You gotta try to lose
them in the cornfield!

649
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,597
He's coming up behind us! Go!

650
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,800
<i>Viper 15, running on fumes. RTB.</i>

651
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,563
They've got us cornered!

652
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,569
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

653
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,247
Mr. Yeager, this is not how
I wanted us to meet, okay?

654
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,748
I'm Shane, and I'm a completely...

655
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,834
And I am not talking to you!
Drive the car!

656
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,627
Watch out! Watch out!

657
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,015
<i>Throw 'em some warning shots!</i>

658
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,564
Man, I don't know how
I'm driving this good.

659
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,566
It's like, today I've gone
to a whole other level.

660
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,484
Road, focus! Stop talking!

661
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,154
Shane, look out!

662
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,996
This may be primarily
my fault, okay.

663
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,456
They said they were
gonna bring a check!

664
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,625
I didn't know they were
gonna send a death squad!

665
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,253
Hang on!

666
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,346
Hey, we got ourselves a winner!
Don's got it over here.

667
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,048
Look out!

668
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:49,233
We lost them! Good job,
stranger from the cornfields!

669
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,693
The scary cars are back.

670
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,372
Lose them at the factory, Shane!

671
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,256
I thought you knew how
to drive this thing! Go!

672
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:27,058
I don't think we're gonna get
that money. Doesn't seem like it.

673
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,610
Cade!

674
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,785
Take 'em upstairs!

675
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,919
We're losing them
on the fifth floor.

676
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,389
- Do that thing, Shane!
- You know it.

677
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,723
What do you mean? What thing?

678
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,176
What we're about to do is
gonna be kind of scary.

679
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,355
Take out your guns and shoot them!

680
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,192
They're shooting at us!

681
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,069
- Tessa, grab my stick! Grab my stick!
- What?

682
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,147
She's got the best
hands in the business.

683
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,109
Ready, Tess? Pull!

684
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,291
- No! No! No!
- No f-ing way!

685
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,756
Oh! Yeah!

686
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,430
Yeah!

687
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,849
Tessa, you are so grounded!

688
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,434
Shit! The rim's cracked.

689
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,561
Optimus. Come on, move! Move!

690
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,192
My foot's stuck! Wait, Cade!

691
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,861
- Lucas!
- Wait! Wait!

692
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,822
Lucas! Lucas, above you!

693
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,820
Run!

694
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,849
Come on, get in, let's go!

695
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,854
<i>I'll bet you wish you could
see my face right now.</i>

696
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:26,233
Lucas, we just left him?

697
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,660
He's gone.

698
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:50,390
My deepest sympathies for
the loss of your friend.

699
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:54,060
Stay here till I'm sure
we weren't followed.

700
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,435
We are all targets now.

701
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,740
So we're hiding out now?
That's the plan?

702
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,742
We're taking orders from a truck?

703
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:11,116
Well, you got a better idea?

704
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,415
Hey, move away
from her, kid. Don't...

705
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,751
Keep your hands off her.
All right? No.

706
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:21,880
You got your ass kicked by a
garage inventor from Texas.

707
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,840
That goes on your resume.

708
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,717
Yeah, it goes on all of yours, too!

709
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:29,388
Do I look like I'm in the mood
for any of your shit today?

710
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,307
Washington thinks we were
chasing a Decepticon target,

711
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:35,810
but our story falls apart if we
don't find this Yeager family first.

712
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,146
Yeah, well, what if he goes
to the cops or the FBI?

713
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,064
They know to hand him over.

714
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,147
His world as he knows it is gone.

715
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:52,076
Well, bright side, you guys met.

716
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,704
Where is he from?

717
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,581
I told you, he's a
driver from Texas.

718
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,329
Texas?

719
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,460
Where, Dublin, Texas?
Shamrock, Texas?

720
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,128
So why does he sound
like a leprechaun?

721
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,547
You'd get your ass kicked
in Ireland for saying that.

722
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,125
Well, we're not in Ireland,
Lucky Charms. We're in Texas.

723
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,177
And so he drives?
What do you mean, he drives?

724
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,470
Like, for a living?

725
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:13,807
Yeah. At least he makes a living.

726
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,600
Thank you.

727
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,060
Look, I race rally cars.

728
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,645
One driver.

729
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,897
One navigator. Her.

730
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,770
By the way, I'm totally legit.

731
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:25,523
I just got picked up by Red Bull.

732
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,153
And just so you know,

733
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,240
my life savings was in
that car back there.

734
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:33,364
- This is not happening.
- Oh, it definitely is.

735
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,460
How old are you?

736
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,753
Twenty.

737
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,922
She's a 17-year-old girl.

738
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,757
So we can work this two ways.

739
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,844
One, I punch you right in the mouth
and you call the police on me.

740
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,546
- Dad.
- Or two,

741
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,765
I just call the cops on you because
this is illegal. She's a minor.

742
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,809
We're protected by the
Romeo and Juliet laws.

743
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,144
We dated for a little while.

744
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,687
I was a sophomore,
and he was a senior. It's fine.

745
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,147
No, it's not fine.

746
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:05,358
We've got a preexisting juvenile
foundational relationship.

747
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,112
- Statute 22.011.
- What?

748
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,822
Texas statute?

749
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,775
- That a real law?
- Yep.

750
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,443
Romeo and Juliet, huh?

751
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,497
- You know how those two ended up?
- In love.

752
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,250
Dead. Do your parents
know about this?

753
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,836
Is your dad okay with you
dating a 17-year-old girl?

754
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:28,882
He took off when I was five, but if
I ever bump into him, I'll ask him.

755
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,925
You know, Tessa,

756
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,219
- I trusted you.
- To what?

757
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:37,390
Never have fun, take a risk,
be a normal teenager, like you?

758
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,516
I am your father, okay?

759
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,894
And I have been busting my
ass to take care of you.

760
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:43,771
Is that what you were doing when
you brought home the truck?

761
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:48,022
All you had to do was report it,
and now Lucas is dead.

762
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:50,195
And my life is over. Thank you.

763
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:52,443
You've taken real good care of me.

764
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,585
<i>Please don't shoot me!</i>

765
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,583
Please! Dad!

766
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,583
They were willing to kill her.

767
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,005
Then they still are.

768
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,804
Somebody somewhere gave that order.

769
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,802
I'm going to find some fingerprints.

770
00:50:22,027 --> 00:50:24,050
<i>Please!</i>

771
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,440
<i>No!</i>

772
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,527
<i>I'm an Autobot! I'm an Autobot!</i>

773
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,362
<i>Grab whatever you think
we can use for supplies.</i>

774
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:35,191
Clothes, anything.
And take that computer.

775
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,995
Let's go.

776
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,169
This is not easy.

777
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,838
You know, you don't suck
at everything, Dad.

778
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:56,135
What the...

779
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,515
I knew it.

780
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,812
You told me he was no one.

781
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,527
Well,

782
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:19,985
this "no one" has our tech.

783
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,269
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

784
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,813
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

785
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,366
- Whoa! Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

786
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:24,724
That was insane!

787
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:27,018
It was awesome,
but it was insane, right?

788
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,907
Oh, yeah! Hell, yeah!

789
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:44,285
He's back! He's alive!

790
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,660
Optimus is here!

791
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:59,300
At last. There is hope after all.

792
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:21,280
Yeah.

793
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:24,784
Mr. Leader of the
Free Galaxy is back.

794
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:28,121
I knew you'd make it.
I never doubted.

795
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:31,457
We got your warning.
We've been waiting.

796
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:36,288
Hell, yeah. Boom time.
We got the gang back together.

797
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:58,192
Humans have asked us
to play by their rules.

798
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:02,321
Well, the rules have just changed.

799
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,825
Human beings, bunch of
backstabbin' weasels.

800
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:08,119
Hound, find your inner compass.

801
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:12,498
Loyalty is but a flower in the
winds of fear and temptation.

802
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,041
What the hell are you saying?

803
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,543
- It's a haiku.
- Cut the crap,

804
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:17,462
before I drop a grenade
down your throat.

805
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:18,921
Try it, you'll be dead.

806
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,249
Oh, please pull it. Please do it.

807
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,593
<i>You know what,
it'll save us so much time.</i>

808
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,094
Well, raise your hand

809
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:29,807
if you're thoroughly disenchanted
with our little pleasant Earth vacation.

810
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,350
So, who's the stowaways?

811
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,977
Oh, whoa, hey, what's with the gun?

812
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,687
Stop. Hound, both of you.

813
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,732
They've risked their lives for mine.

814
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,106
<i>We owe them.</i>

815
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:43,571
<i>So, there's been no
sign of any others?</i>

816
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,782
- <i>Nada.</i>
- We are all that's left.

817
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,992
They're picking us off, one by one.

818
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:52,493
We're the pathetic, dirty foursome.
And you make five.

819
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,121
So that's our best-case scenario?

820
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,669
Autobot witness protection?

821
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,048
Hey, Speed Racer,
you're welcome to leave anytime.

822
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:04,467
Well, for the record, Superdad,

823
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:08,221
I'm not hiding with you.
I'm hiding out with that big guy.

824
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,890
Sensei, with your fate unknown,

825
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:12,892
Bumblebee has held command,

826
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:15,645
despite his complete and
total lack of anything

827
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:18,397
resembling warrior discipline.

828
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,524
He's like a child.

829
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,150
<i>This child is about
to kick your ass.</i>

830
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,398
He brings us shame.

831
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,572
Cage fight.

832
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,740
Smartass.

833
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,658
What's the matter with them?

834
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:33,621
Am I the lone sage who sees through

835
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:36,582
this puppy-dog eyes act?
It's beneath you.

836
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,418
Yes, I've been waiting for them
all to dispatch each other,

837
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,587
so I could take charge
with no trouble at all.

838
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,506
Just me reporting to me.

839
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,132
Well, it sure looks like
you've been missed.

840
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:48,928
Autobots, Lockdown is hunting us

841
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:51,514
and humans are helping.

842
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,891
We need to know why.

843
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:57,266
Well, listen, I don't know why,
but I have an idea about who.

844
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,564
This drone I stole recorded
footage of an Autobot raid.

845
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:07,731
It's in pieces, but watch
what happens here.

846
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,366
Oh, that's Leadfoot.

847
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,784
They rip him apart.

848
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,661
Savages.

849
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,580
And later, this truck
comes to haul him off.

850
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,081
KSI. Kinetic Solutions.

851
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,625
Defense, aerospace,
government contracts.

852
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,544
They designed this drone.

853
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,087
So these government guys
just hunt you down,

854
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,461
and then pass you off to this KSI?

855
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,508
The company is
headquartered in Chicago.

856
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,218
That could be where they were taken.

857
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,470
No way to get inside
without a battle.

858
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,265
Well, what if you had
some human help?

859
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:36,517
- What, are you two partners now?
- Sweetie, we're targets now, too.

860
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,061
We need to know why or we'll
never get our lives back.

861
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,479
Autobots,

862
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,149
I have sworn to never kill humans.

863
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,483
Big mistake.

864
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,357
But when I find out
who's behind this,

865
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,989
he's going to die.

866
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,782
Hooah!

867
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:07,298
<i>There's a full-on
manhunt out for us,</i>

868
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:08,925
<i>so we have some new rules.</i>

869
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:11,344
<i>Anyone who has got a
badge is not our friend.</i>

870
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,179
<i>We're gonna divide and conquer.</i>

871
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,759
<i>You two in charge of stealing food
and the essentials. And nothing else.</i>

872
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:25,191
<i>Chicago KSI headquarters
is like a fortress.</i>

873
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,360
<i>I'm gonna find a way into
their top-secret military wing.</i>

874
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:30,029
<i>Find something to blackmail this
company and the government.</i>

875
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,607
<i>We're gonna get our freedom back.</i>

876
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:43,494
Good morning, Mr. Joyce.

877
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,383
What was that sound?

878
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,677
That's "the" sound.

879
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,595
That you asked for.

880
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,724
No, I asked for boundless.
Transcendent.

881
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,059
When you walk through
a door in this building,

882
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,183
it should sound like you've
stepped into the future.

883
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,236
Present.

884
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:15,491
Say it.

885
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,243
Future.

886
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:21,038
<i>The past is history.
The present is past.</i>

887
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,873
<i>The future is now.</i>

888
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:25,622
Why can't I get in touch with you?

889
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,630
Don't you realize what
the Arctic find means?

890
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,675
You know that story we
were all told as children

891
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,052
about a giant asteroid
that struck the Earth

892
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,513
millions of years ago and
wiped out the dinosaurs?

893
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,182
- Vaguely.
- We were wrong.

894
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:43,060
This metal caused the
great extinction.

895
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,729
How and why, I can't yet say.

896
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:48,399
But carbon dating puts it
at 65 million years B.C.

897
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,861
This ore you've got us digging for is
a lot more dangerous than you think.

898
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:52,987
And my people...

899
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:57,616
Darcy, I think that you've been
out in the field for far too long.

900
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,453
Why don't we discuss
dinosaurs over dinner?

901
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:03,373
- Ribs?
- Not a chance.

902
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,910
You have no idea what's
been happening here.

903
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,871
We're about to make
the quantum leap.

904
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,832
A rare-earth metal.

905
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:15,176
Molecularly unstable.

906
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:18,551
Industrial uses, none.

907
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,057
And then the aliens came.

908
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,055
And we made the connection.

909
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,644
It's what they're made of.

910
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,562
<i>It's the Holy Grail.</i>

911
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,232
"Transformium."
That's what we're calling it.

912
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,734
Focus-grouped. Catchy.

913
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,319
- Trademarked.
- Yeah.

914
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,530
This is the greatest
advance in modern physics

915
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,407
since the splitting of the atom.

916
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,826
It's programmable matter.

917
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,328
And now, we've mapped its genome.

918
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,789
- I.
- Now you've mapped its genome.

919
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:49,085
And now we can begin to give it

920
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:51,459
instructions.

921
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,924
This is extremely good.

922
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,389
Watch this.

923
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:12,729
We can change anything
into anything.

924
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:18,482
Sensual, almost. Don't you think?

925
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,413
Do you like music?

926
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:27,532
The Pill.

927
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:32,371
Perhaps something a
little more violent?

928
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,801
Oh, my God. You've done it.

929
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,554
In aerospace, the military...

930
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:44,557
We will own the entire
robotics industry.

931
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,225
All exploration.

932
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:49,805
The oceans. Space. Everything.

933
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,475
Wembley. What is this?

934
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,484
The jellyfish commercial
that you wanted.

935
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,445
You said they were erotic
yet deadly, like women.

936
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,156
I never said that.

937
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,740
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

938
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,825
I definitely heard you say it

939
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,076
'cause you were talking
about your ex-girlfriend,

940
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,036
who was sexy, but a bitch.

941
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:08,580
Please don't eat on the tour.

942
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,625
Is that her?

943
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:16,922
Hey, I found a whole
bunch of boxes of clothes.

944
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,216
So, sweetie, you can get some long
pants, nice, loose-fitting ones,

945
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:21,919
and lose the short shorts, okay?
What'd you guys get?

946
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,265
It's protein.

947
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,267
Look, I said the essentials, okay?

948
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,769
It wasn't easy.
We almost got caught.

949
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,937
You stole mouthwash?

950
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,481
I like to be fresh when I'm
making out with your daughter.

951
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,602
That's funny.

952
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,907
Yeah, that's not happening ever.

953
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,117
Ever?

954
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:48,822
This is our military
prototype, Galvatron.

955
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:51,165
I don't understand it.

956
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,459
This is the fifth iteration.

957
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,412
Why does he keep
turning out like this?

958
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,338
It's just some bugs
in the final render.

959
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,926
I modeled Galvatron
after Optimus Prime.

960
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:04,470
Why does he keep
looking like Megatron?

961
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:07,056
<i>Rendering sequence is
almost finished. Stand by.</i>

962
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:09,384
Simple coding.

963
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:13,475
Algorithms!

964
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,272
Math!

965
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:18,651
Why can't we make
what we want to make,

966
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,150
the way we want to make it?

967
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,823
Why?

968
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:29,575
And does that look like a
consumer-friendly face to you?

969
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:33,332
And what about that
big hole in the chest?

970
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,542
I think it's bad-ass. I like it.

971
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:38,587
- Love it.
- Well, I hate it.

972
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,882
Oh, here he is.

973
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,343
That bald-headed Doc Frankenstein.

974
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:48,222
Ma'am, this is not legal.
This is illegal experimentation.

975
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:50,099
Aliens would never
do this to people!

976
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,850
Eat you, kill you,
maybe, but that's it.

977
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,186
This ain't right!
Nobody puts baby in a box!

978
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:57,140
Ahhh!

979
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,066
This is worse than waterboarding!

980
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:01,151
This little gentleman has
been translating for us

981
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,862
all the information that
comes from these two heads.

982
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,573
Their history,
their science, everything.

983
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,201
- Is that Megatron?
- Precisely.

984
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,078
Where did you get all this?

985
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:12,871
Special government contract.

986
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,707
Now we know everything
about Transformers.

987
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:17,710
And now at long last we
can build them ourselves.

988
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:20,038
And we can build them better.

989
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:43,945
Yeah, that's good, Bee.
That'll get us in.

990
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,034
<i>A couple times a day,
these guys are moving</i>

991
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:53,245
<i>in vehicle shipments into KSI
for something called "scanning."</i>

992
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,747
Major security all over.

993
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:58,334
So our best shot at getting in is a
back classified research entrance.

994
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:01,163
<i>I'm gonna drive in with
Bee tomorrow morning.</i>

995
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:06,383
Excuse me.

996
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,719
There's no smooching
in front of me, okay?

997
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,096
You're so square.
Who even says "smooching"?

998
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,931
I tell you, no respect.

999
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:14,683
It's just impossible sometimes.

1000
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:18,308
Yeah. I went through
that with Bumblebee.

1001
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:28,189
Calm down. Calm down.

1002
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:29,698
You know, at a time like this,

1003
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,369
the idea is to keep cool, not look cool,
so why don't you lose the glasses?

1004
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:36,493
About a month ago,

1005
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:39,166
middle of the night, I thought
I heard noises in my house.

1006
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,501
Was that you?

1007
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:41,627
What? Come on. No way.

1008
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,170
Don't lie to me, kid.

1009
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,922
You see that guy with
the gun out there?

1010
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:45,964
There's so many guys with guns.

1011
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,049
Let's get out of the
car and tell him

1012
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,384
we're about to break
in and it's your idea,

1013
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,677
'cause I don't care. I'm old,
I've already lived long enough.

1014
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:51,804
You have a really bad habit

1015
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,597
of having these conversations
at the wrong time, man.

1016
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:56,350
You want to come clean or
you want me to make a mess?

1017
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:57,684
Sir, can I talk to you
for a second, please?

1018
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:59,682
It was me, it was me,
it was me, it was me.

1019
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:03,395
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1020
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,023
- Taking it in for scanning?
- Uh-huh.

1021
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,781
All right. You're good to go.

1022
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:12,859
I'm literally gonna kill you.

1023
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,744
<i>Scanning in bay three.</i>

1024
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,197
<i>We took old, alien technology</i>

1025
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:20,791
<i>and made it better in every way.</i>

1026
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:23,039
<i>Introducing Stinger.</i>

1027
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:27,332
<i>KSI. We make the world.</i>

1028
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,840
That is a bad-ass robot.

1029
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,054
He kind of looks like you, Bee.

1030
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,640
<i>Here is the past.
And now the future.</i>

1031
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,183
They're trying to build
their own versions.

1032
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,727
Well, at least they're picking
cooler cars than this.

1033
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,773
<i>You talk to me like that?</i>

1034
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:45,858
Bee, stop!

1035
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:48,861
You see what happens
from being a wiseass?

1036
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,612
<i>Now get out of here.</i>

1037
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,990
<i>Stinger, inspired by Bumblebee,</i>

1038
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,659
<i>but better in every way.</i>

1039
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,286
Son of a...

1040
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:59,204
No, no! You gotta calm down.

1041
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,373
- He's crazy!
- Stop!

1042
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:04,418
Bumblebee! Bee, stop going psycho!

1043
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:08,088
OUR FACTORY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH
TRANSFORMIUM FOR PRODUCTION...

1044
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,674
...BECAUSE YOU DON'T KEEP
YOUR PROMISE TO SUPPLY IT.

1045
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,594
My delicate flower, I can't
understand you when you're angry.

1046
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,929
Actually, I don't really
understand you at all.

1047
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:18,140
Our entire factory
is up and running...

1048
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:19,725
Excuse me one second. Hey!

1049
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,977
Hey, you two! Grease monkeys.

1050
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,147
What the hell is going on here? Huh?

1051
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,690
What's with this vintage crap?

1052
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:29,067
We're not scanning
collector car junk.

1053
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,695
What do you think it is
that we make here? Hmm?

1054
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:34,615
We make poetry. We're poets.

1055
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:38,160
All right? You work for me,
you get one mistake. One. Understood?

1056
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,912
- It won't happen again.
- It certainly won't.

1057
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:42,581
So let's get this pathetic
thing out of here.

1058
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,333
And you, too.

1059
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,286
So sorry. So sorry.

1060
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:48,045
Let's move on.

1061
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,463
Watch him. I'm going to
see what I can find.

1062
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:51,131
Quietly get out of here.

1063
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,509
I swear. I swear. I can't
bear it when you're angry.

1064
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,757
You know how it upsets me.

1065
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:03,769
Bee, you gotta calm down right now.

1066
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:04,853
<i>I'm perfectly calm, dude.</i>

1067
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:07,356
You gotta breathe, or just do
whatever it is that you do.

1068
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,233
<i>I'm calm. I'm calm.
I'm not even touching it.</i>

1069
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:11,026
<i>Okay, I'm barely touching it.
I'm barely touching it.</i>

1070
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,653
Oh, my God. Turn back
into a car right now!

1071
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:13,737
<i>Get out of my face, all right?</i>

1072
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:14,905
<i>Our design team</i>

1073
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,657
<i>started with the Bumblebee.</i>

1074
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:19,368
<i>But really, this alien's
design was decrepit</i>

1075
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:21,036
<i>and, let's face it, antique.</i>

1076
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,579
<i>What the...</i>

1077
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,248
- Don't take it personally, Bee.
<i>- Kind of old and ratty.</i>

1078
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:26,417
<i>You mean ugly.</i>

1079
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:28,919
<i>- Oh, hell, no!</i>
- No! No!

1080
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,296
<i>You think you're better than me!</i>

1081
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,170
<i>Yee-hah!</i>

1082
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,639
What did you touch?

1083
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,424
Uh...

1084
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:46,645
<i>I told you, homeboy
Can't touch this</i>

1085
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,939
My office in 15 minutes.

1086
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,607
<i>This is dissection room seven.</i>

1087
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:53,819
<i>Galvatron, render
postmortem number 12.</i>

1088
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:58,320
<i>Continued head disfigurement
at event number 32.</i>

1089
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:05,038
So what about the deal? Is it done?

1090
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,123
Did you get the Seed?

1091
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,624
We get it when the bounty
hunter gets Prime.

1092
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:08,709
Uh-huh.

1093
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:11,211
Meanwhile, there has
been a complication.

1094
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,164
A what?

1095
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,215
No, no.

1096
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:17,589
At KSI, we don't use
words like that.

1097
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:21,972
A civilian harboring the Autobots has
hacked into one of your mini-drones.

1098
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:25,222
Meaning, they may know
of your involvement.

1099
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,927
What?

1100
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,444
That was a little bit intense.

1101
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:39,781
I need more Transformium, and I
need it now, to build more prototypes.

1102
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,367
You tell your alien bounty hunter

1103
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:46,496
that I have staked my
company on this deal.

1104
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:48,832
And I have merely staked my life.

1105
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,084
Hey, you came to me
on this, remember?

1106
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:52,878
You retire from the CIA,

1107
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:56,006
you get a seven-figure piece
of my company, and you and I

1108
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:59,343
revolutionize national
defense together.

1109
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:04,140
But, Attinger, buddy,
for both our sakes,

1110
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,430
you need to deliver

1111
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:10,054
the Seed.

1112
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:28,781
<i>I'm in. Can you see my camera?</i>

1113
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:31,747
<i>They're melting Ratchet.</i>

1114
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,419
They slaughtered Ratchet!

1115
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,881
I'm gonna tear them apart!

1116
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:39,754
Metal.

1117
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:43,178
Just metal. That's what I
always thought of them.

1118
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:44,471
Well, they're not.

1119
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:47,095
They're living things,
with souls like ours.

1120
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:50,977
Once, I spoke to one.

1121
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,230
And you're working
with Transformium?

1122
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:56,149
Uh, yeah, that's what I do. I am.

1123
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:59,524
I'm out there digging for it.
There's just not much left to find.

1124
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:02,406
So that's how badly you
boys need more, huh?

1125
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:04,825
Reduced to melting evil
old Decepticons down.

1126
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:09,162
No. That's an Autobot there.

1127
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:10,956
The ones who fought for us.

1128
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,542
- I've got this taken care of from here.
- Right.

1129
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,627
Same badge code scanned
at two separate gates.

1130
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,797
I'm having the classified
area locked down now.

1131
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,506
Check that guy.

1132
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,101
Hey!

1133
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:33,061
Stop right there!

1134
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:38,392
Stop!

1135
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,445
Freeze!

1136
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:48,994
Up against the wall.

1137
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,038
All right.

1138
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:56,164
Corporate espionage. That's a
very serious crime, Mr. Yeager.

1139
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,388
Wow.

1140
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,817
Look, I want a lawyer.

1141
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:23,195
The Justice Department.
Somebody I can trust.

1142
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:24,362
I'm just trying to
protect my family, okay?

1143
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:26,364
Not from your company,
from the government.

1144
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:27,949
Mr. Yeager,

1145
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,035
who do you think I work for?

1146
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:33,121
You're trying to protect your
family, that's admirable.

1147
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:36,041
I'm trying to defend the
nation from alien war.

1148
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,334
We've had a taste of
what that looks like,

1149
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:40,254
and we are not gonna
tolerate another. Now...

1150
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:44,966
There is a version of this conversation
where you get to go back to your barn,

1151
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,718
your daughter gets to
graduate with honors,

1152
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,888
and life as you know it will go on.

1153
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:54,222
You have no idea what
you're involved with here.

1154
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,013
Really?

1155
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,731
What's the other version
of this conversation?

1156
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:03,068
The one when you send in the
hired help to murder my little girl?

1157
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:06,147
Or you gonna man up
and do it yourself?

1158
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,447
What's your preference?

1159
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,911
I'm going to ask you this once.

1160
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:15,330
Where is Optimus Prime?

1161
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:50,949
<i>Come on. Let's get out of here.</i>

1162
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,823
We're moving. Basement.

1163
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,823
They're here.

1164
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:02,043
Get out! All of you!

1165
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,461
Science fair's over, meatbags!

1166
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,005
- Destroy the lab!
- Move, move, move, move!

1167
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:07,925
Look out! Look out!

1168
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,836
Destroy it all!

1169
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:16,263
Danger! Security breach! Danger...

1170
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,517
Guys! It's me!

1171
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:19,519
Break me out of this
Frankenstein box!

1172
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,770
Hey!

1173
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:22,472
Hey!

1174
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:24,983
Hey!

1175
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:26,109
Stop!

1176
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,777
That's company property!

1177
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,856
They're not your property!

1178
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:36,327
They were my friends.

1179
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:41,708
Oh, you ain't talking so much now!
You got Hound in front of you, huh?

1180
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:43,168
Go ahead.

1181
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,045
Show us your true colors,
once and for all.

1182
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:49,046
Just give me the word,
I'll splatter him.

1183
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:53,011
Why don't you tell Itchy Fingers here
that this is all the spoils of war.

1184
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:54,713
Dead metal.

1185
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:59,309
Innovation. What we
do here is science.

1186
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:02,479
Because if we don't do it,
somebody else will.

1187
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,981
Because you cannot stop technology!

1188
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:08,526
We're not your technology!

1189
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,908
Let me vaporize his ass.

1190
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:20,035
I broke the code.
I own your whole genome.

1191
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:23,375
The world will know
what you're doing here.

1192
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:26,878
The world? The world will approve.

1193
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:29,047
We can make you now.

1194
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:33,924
Don't you get it?
We don't need you anymore.

1195
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:37,255
That was cruel.

1196
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,474
Autobots,

1197
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,481
we're done.

1198
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,858
We're done? We're not
gonna kick a little bit of ass?

1199
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,986
I've been itching to
kill something lately.

1200
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,737
This is our chance.
We have to stop him.

1201
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:53,947
You have to stop him.

1202
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:55,407
It's never been tested in the field.

1203
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:57,742
Labs, military bases,
but not on civilian streets.

1204
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,452
Down there a Defense
Department contract

1205
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,413
was just attacked in
a terrorist attack.

1206
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:04,207
This is now a CIA military op.

1207
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:08,082
You're indemnified. Respond!

1208
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,463
Let's go.

1209
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,262
KSI Chicago, closest
live sat, patch it in.

1210
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:18,805
Been an unprovoked Autobot attack.

1211
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,224
Bring up Galvatron.

1212
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,186
Transforming Galvatron.

1213
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:28,140
<i>Galvatron coming online.</i>

1214
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:32,231
<i>Bring up Stinger.</i>

1215
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:35,147
<i>Stinger coming online.</i>

1216
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:44,664
Let's show these alien terrorists
what an upgrade looks like.

1217
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:46,708
<i>Galvatron and Stinger are moving</i>

1218
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:48,581
<i>to intercept targets.</i>

1219
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:57,294
<i>Reapers. Five targets in
the open. Good picture.</i>

1220
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:03,304
Two miles to intercept.

1221
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:15,896
200 meters.

1222
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,822
Engage.

1223
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,820
Transform.

1224
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,876
Whoa.

1225
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,850
We are programming this, right?

1226
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,977
Yes. Mostly.

1227
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:50,647
<i>Systems seem to have malfunctioned.</i>

1228
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:53,191
Targeting five bogeys.

1229
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:54,901
Engaging rockets.

1230
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:56,603
Missiles away.

1231
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,210
Gotta haul ass, Bee! Come on!

1232
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,868
<i>Stinger is in pursuit.</i>

1233
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,478
Misfire, misfire! Misfire, misfire!

1234
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,856
System failure. Galvatron
just fired four rockets.

1235
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:35,275
Whoa! They're shooting at us!

1236
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,041
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Watch out! What are you doing?

1237
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,648
<i>Argh!</i>

1238
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,818
<i>What was that?</i>

1239
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:28,620
We need a full medical team now.
Possible civilian casualties.

1240
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:30,955
I mean, you got a lot of people
in the crossfire here. I don't like...

1241
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:33,291
You're making history here.
For your country, for the world.

1242
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:35,418
Human freedom is at stake.

1243
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:38,121
Innocent people die all the time.

1244
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:46,342
Come on, Optimus!

1245
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:13,540
Tessa!

1246
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:24,175
Make him fight.
Don't let him go down.

1247
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:25,677
Make him fight!

1248
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,345
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

1249
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,561
Tessa!

1250
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,188
Tessa!

1251
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,061
Tessa, run to the field!

1252
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:48,283
You have no soul!

1253
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:51,988
That is why I have no fear!

1254
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,323
You die!

1255
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:08,257
Help me!

1256
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,695
What is that?

1257
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:36,581
That's my asset.
Pull Galvatron back.

1258
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,374
Do it.

1259
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:10,531
I got to go get her.

1260
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:15,783
Tessa!

1261
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:18,081
Don't go out there! He'll kill you!

1262
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,124
- She needs my help!
- She's hidden!

1263
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,210
Optimus! Optimus, get up, get up!

1264
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:25,505
I can't. Get out of here.

1265
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:32,887
I feel sorry for you, Prime.
Your allegiance to these humans.

1266
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:40,016
The trouble with loyalty to a cause is
that the cause will always betray you.

1267
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,647
Who sent you here?

1268
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:44,899
Where do you think you came from?

1269
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,352
You think you were born?

1270
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:51,155
No. You were built.

1271
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:54,325
And your creators want you back.

1272
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:57,529
We all work for someone.

1273
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,374
No, no.

1274
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,509
No.

1275
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:12,635
It's got her!

1276
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:13,970
- She's in the car!
- Tessa!

1277
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:16,389
- No!
- Tessa!

1278
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:22,728
Dad!

1279
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:25,189
Tessa, get out!

1280
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,563
Get out!

1281
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,652
Tessa!

1282
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:34,657
Get out! Tessa!

1283
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:35,700
Dad, help me!

1284
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:39,120
- Tessa!
- Help me, help me! Dad! Dad!

1285
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,750
Dad!

1286
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:46,419
- Dad!
- Tessa! Break the glass!

1287
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:49,213
- Break the glass to get out!
- I'm trying!

1288
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,215
- Tessa, I can't hold on!
- Dad!

1289
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,592
Tessa!

1290
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:54,802
- Help me!
- Just break it! Break the glass!

1291
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:56,504
Tess...

1292
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,018
Cade, warn the Autobots!

1293
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:05,438
Dad, help me! Don't leave me!

1294
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:08,437
No!

1295
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:39,472
Take that human to the trash.

1296
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:52,314
Mr. Secretary.

1297
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:56,405
My team is on the way.
This is a CIA operation.

1298
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:59,033
<i>This is my asset.</i>

1299
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,744
Tell the military to stand down.

1300
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:03,329
Hang on, I have the White House.

1301
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,413
<i>Agent, hello!</i>

1302
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:05,665
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

1303
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:08,042
Boy, is it a flurry of excitement
over here at the White House.

1304
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,461
Everybody is super,
super mad. At me.

1305
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:12,380
So, I went over my notes
from our last meeting,

1306
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:15,299
and I'm not sure when
you said anything about

1307
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,301
a "giant alien warship
over Michigan Avenue."

1308
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:20,175
Tell the President
this is not an attack.

1309
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,313
Remember this ship, Prime?

1310
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:32,149
Built for all you Knights,
you great crusaders,

1311
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:34,402
to explore the universe.

1312
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:39,028
Well, I commandeered it.
It's my personal prison now.

1313
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:36,331
Optimus?

1314
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:47,300
Welcome back to the
Knights' Temenos, Prime.

1315
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:51,729
You have disgraced it.

1316
01:25:56,068 --> 01:26:00,237
Join your fellow rebels,
fugitive scum.

1317
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:03,949
It's for the rarest of specimens.
The worst of the worst.

1318
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:05,993
It's taken centuries,

1319
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:10,164
but I've collected all
the Knights but you.

1320
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:21,668
The creators want to sweep
their chessboard clean.

1321
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:28,015
I'm slave to no one.

1322
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:33,179
All this species
mixing with species.

1323
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:35,564
It upsets the cosmic balance.

1324
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:38,150
The creators, they don't like it.

1325
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:42,856
They built you to do
what you were told.

1326
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:45,950
Why hasn't it taken off yet?

1327
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:48,324
Come on, Bee, it's descending.
You got to get on it!

1328
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,287
<i>Savoy, mission accomplished.</i>

1329
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:53,457
<i>Lockdown has Prime.
The deal's going down now.</i>

1330
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,660
Picking up the Seed
at the recon point.

1331
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:12,477
<i>Nest, Talon. L.Z. appears clear.</i>

1332
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:35,332
Much as I've enjoyed the hunt,

1333
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:38,002
I won't miss your wretched planet.

1334
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:41,923
Our deal is done.
One Prime for one Seed.

1335
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:46,377
Handle it with care.

1336
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:51,849
I trust your species is ready.

1337
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:54,348
Don't worry about our species.

1338
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:57,313
Farewell, Earth.

1339
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,900
Come on, come on!

1340
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:22,079
Bee, come on!

1341
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:27,586
It's a bad idea. But I'm
all about bad ideas.

1342
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:29,679
Let's go!

1343
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:32,974
Well, let's rock.

1344
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:53,202
This is crazy.

1345
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:54,787
Look, you wanna cut and
run, you better do it now.

1346
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:56,664
I'm gonna die trying.

1347
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:58,958
Hey, I'm not here to help
you get your daughter.

1348
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:01,206
You're here to help
me get my girlfriend.

1349
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:07,300
Engage dark-matter drives.
Full power.

1350
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:18,435
We're behind enemy lines now.

1351
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:21,772
Lockdown's ship has
booby traps. Eyes open.

1352
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:24,733
Beware of his bone grinders,
brain blinders, flesh peelers,

1353
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:25,818
chromosomal inverters,

1354
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:29,405
catatonic sludge, black hole trapdoors,
and, of course, radiation.

1355
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:32,449
We must be quick. We have
the element of surprise.

1356
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:35,786
Let's try to use violence
as a last resort.

1357
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:38,080
Oh, get it!

1358
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:39,540
I kill you! Kill you!

1359
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:40,958
Ugh. I hate those things.

1360
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:43,419
- That's freaky.
- He's not alive anymore.

1361
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:46,088
Well, we looked.
They're not here. Let's go.

1362
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:48,716
What? Hey, I'm not going
anywhere without Tessa.

1363
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:51,343
I'm unclear. What's in it for me?

1364
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:53,637
What's in it for you?

1365
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:56,640
Easy. Let's use words.

1366
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:59,643
What's in it for you
is I don't kill you.

1367
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:03,814
We're getting the boss back.
And the girl. Copy?

1368
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:08,277
Okay, okay. Very persuasive.
Textbook machismo.

1369
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:11,322
Well, then. We'll need
to sabotage something.

1370
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:15,159
Better hurry. Because dark-matter
drives are preparing to take off.

1371
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,494
- Oh, wonderful.
- I give us 10 minutes.

1372
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:19,663
Is that what that sound is?
The engines filling up?

1373
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:21,373
Are you telling me that
thing's gonna be...

1374
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:23,250
This is gonna be flying out
of here in 10 minutes?

1375
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,376
- Uh-huh.
- Ten minutes?

1376
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:25,753
Could be nine. Worst case, seven.

1377
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:28,047
- Humans, search the cell blocks.
- We're wasting time, let's go.

1378
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:30,591
- We'll find the center core.
- Let's move.

1379
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:33,135
We're gonna stop
this nightmare ship.

1380
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:49,735
We're never gonna find
her in this huge ship.

1381
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:52,359
Like a needle in a haystack.

1382
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:54,031
Tessa!

1383
01:30:55,158 --> 01:30:57,201
Great. Great.

1384
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:00,746
Oh, that was smooth.

1385
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:03,540
No, that was really smooth,
letting everybody know we're here.

1386
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:05,914
Now they're gonna be looking for us.

1387
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:17,721
Better hurry, Crosshairs,
before we go into space!

1388
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:20,766
Ah. Here's the little
jujube right here.

1389
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:24,144
Hello, Mama.

1390
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:38,446
Who fired the anchors?

1391
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:45,040
Who's on my ship?
We have a loose prisoner.

1392
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:51,422
Hurry up. We got like six minutes.

1393
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:53,170
We'll find her.

1394
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:56,418
Hold up.

1395
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:01,014
Back up.

1396
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,519
Come on, these things are
gonna find us. Hurry, hide.

1397
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:56,024
Whoa!

1398
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:03,360
Weapons!

1399
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:06,326
Come here. Help me. Hurry, hurry.

1400
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:13,378
Help me up.

1401
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:16,252
There are some weird
sounds out there.

1402
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:02,386
- What is that?
- I don't know.

1403
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:03,929
You ready?

1404
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:05,631
Run.

1405
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,686
Oh!

1406
01:34:14,232 --> 01:34:16,275
All right, we're not going
down without a fight.

1407
01:34:18,736 --> 01:34:20,487
They turn that corner,
and we're gonna take them.

1408
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:21,572
You ready or you gonna
bitch out on me?

1409
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:22,698
No, I got your back.

1410
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:24,651
- Are you ready?
- Absolutely.

1411
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:28,203
Don't bitch out on me.
Are you ready?

1412
01:34:28,204 --> 01:34:29,913
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1413
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:33,618
Whoa, okay! I surrender!
I surrender! I surrender!

1414
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:40,591
I'm so sorry! I'm so, so, so sorry!

1415
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:41,842
What'd you do? How'd you do that?

1416
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:43,177
I have no idea!

1417
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:46,381
You no-good, chickenshit little rat!

1418
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:48,390
Look at that. You see that? Oh!

1419
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:50,183
Whoa!

1420
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:52,970
You stay here, Lucky Charms!

1421
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:14,166
Oh, man. I am so gonna
patent this shit.

1422
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:28,305
Ew!

1423
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:30,140
Tess!

1424
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:32,809
Dad! Help me!

1425
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:34,019
Hey!

1426
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,097
- Tess?
- Tess!

1427
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:43,027
Come on, move, move!

1428
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:44,738
Tessa!

1429
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:47,449
Shane, I love you! I love you!
You saved me! You saved me!

1430
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:49,151
I know. I know.

1431
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:52,621
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1432
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:55,666
- Thank you. You saved me.
- Oh, yeah, he saved you. Yeah.

1433
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:57,000
Yeah.

1434
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:59,670
I think you and Mr. "I Surrender"
have a lot to catch up about, sweetie.

1435
01:35:59,671 --> 01:36:01,296
He saved me, too. You should
have seen him in there.

1436
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:04,883
I mean, our hero. Let's go. Now.

1437
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:07,757
- Eyes open.
- I almost got it.

1438
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:10,180
Big boy coming through!
Move, move, move.

1439
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:11,723
Whoa!

1440
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:15,852
This has got to be the Supermax.
Watch the corners.

1441
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:17,646
There's a lot of cages.

1442
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:19,898
Oh, yeah. Creepy critters in here.

1443
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:22,526
I don't want to know
what's in the big cage.

1444
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,070
- What's this?
- Hound, don't do it.

1445
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:28,149
Aw, you don't look very
dangerous in there.

1446
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:32,369
Oh, that's festering ugliness.

1447
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:34,746
I'm hit! I'm down! It's melting!

1448
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:36,448
It burns!

1449
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:38,709
Ugh, I think it's acid!

1450
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:42,671
Ah, nuts. It's just shizzle.

1451
01:36:43,172 --> 01:36:45,090
I hope that's not contagious.

1452
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:48,761
I got to hurt you now.
You're just too disturbing to live.

1453
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:50,846
Take that, bitch!

1454
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,473
Oh! You're dead.

1455
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:55,642
- Hound!
- He's alive!

1456
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:56,893
Hold on, boss, we're coming!

1457
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:59,146
- Optimus, sound off!
- In here, quick!

1458
01:36:59,147 --> 01:37:00,564
Hang on, we're comin for you!

1459
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:02,399
The arms of this Knight Ship detach!

1460
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,444
We can break free!
It's a separate ship! Hurry!

1461
01:37:05,445 --> 01:37:06,903
Where's the cockpit? Right or left?

1462
01:37:06,904 --> 01:37:08,280
- Right!
- I'm on it, boss.

1463
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:10,407
Hurry. We have no time.

1464
01:37:10,408 --> 01:37:11,825
<i>Sensei.</i>

1465
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:15,412
Let's rock! I always wanted
to fly one of these things.

1466
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:17,456
I'm there, boss!

1467
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,710
Hey, Yeager Technologies,

1468
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:24,664
you gonna invent us a
way out of this one?

1469
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:30,836
Oh!

1470
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:34,131
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

1471
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:36,308
I am not doing this.

1472
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:38,807
- I am not doing that.
- Yes, we are.

1473
01:37:39,187 --> 01:37:41,646
No, it's good. It's stable. Come on.

1474
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:43,231
No way.

1475
01:37:43,232 --> 01:37:45,108
Sweetie, you know why I'm here?
I'm here to protect you.

1476
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:46,485
You've done great at that.

1477
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:49,188
I want you to trust me right now.
We're getting down. Let's go.

1478
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:58,413
Don't look down, okay? Step.
See, it's easy. Come on.

1479
01:38:00,458 --> 01:38:03,126
Careful, these cables are
starting to get thinner here!

1480
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:05,796
- Step. Step. There.
- Oh, my God!

1481
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:08,632
See, don't look down!
All right? Don't look down.

1482
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:11,506
We're gonna be at the
building in no time!

1483
01:38:12,053 --> 01:38:13,970
You okay, Tess?

1484
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,972
Keep stepping.

1485
01:38:16,015 --> 01:38:18,888
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Dad! Oh!

1486
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:25,857
All right, sweetie. You need
to keep moving here, okay?

1487
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:27,526
- Come on!
- I can't.

1488
01:38:27,527 --> 01:38:29,236
I'm freaking out.

1489
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:30,862
You need to move now!

1490
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:34,533
I'm not moving!
I'm going back to the ship!

1491
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:38,537
Oh, shit!

1492
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:40,038
You can't go back
to the ship, honey!

1493
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:41,331
Watch me!

1494
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:43,250
You are not 18 years old yet and
you're gonna do what I say!

1495
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:44,952
Now let's go!

1496
01:38:51,217 --> 01:38:54,636
We need to go this way,
okay. Not that way.

1497
01:38:54,637 --> 01:38:56,179
Talk to her, Romeo! Now!

1498
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:57,556
Come on, for God's sake.

1499
01:38:57,557 --> 01:38:59,509
Do not start with me.

1500
01:39:03,896 --> 01:39:05,647
Oh, my God, what is that?

1501
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:07,190
All right, Tessa.

1502
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:08,525
Don't look back.

1503
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:10,902
Well, don't say that to me.
Now I want to turn around.

1504
01:39:10,903 --> 01:39:12,529
It's nothing major, sweetie.

1505
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:14,364
Well, that means it's totally major!

1506
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:15,699
I'm gonna have to point
this gun in your direction.

1507
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:18,949
It's gonna feel like it's in
your direction, but I'm not.

1508
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:21,788
- You better hurry.
- Are you trying to kill me?

1509
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:23,707
I had to bust my ass to get
up here on this spaceship!

1510
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:25,542
- Shoot it!
- Get down now!

1511
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:48,729
Tessa, wait! I'm coming
for you! Tessa! Oh!

1512
01:39:58,326 --> 01:40:00,827
- Oh, my God!
- I'm coming!

1513
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:02,871
Hold on!

1514
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,521
You're the best, Bee!
You are the best.

1515
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:29,940
<i>You damn right!
And don't ever forget it.</i>

1516
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:32,609
You see that? Look at me!
We're off the ship, right?

1517
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:35,195
Bumblebee! Bumblebee! Friendly!

1518
01:40:35,196 --> 01:40:39,571
Enemy ships are coming
in hot. Get on! Get on!

1519
01:40:42,912 --> 01:40:44,704
Oh!

1520
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:51,703
Hold your knickers, I'm punching it!

1521
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:03,473
They got three ships on them!

1522
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:06,222
I'm giving it the juice!

1523
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:12,224
Come on, Bee, take them out!

1524
01:41:16,821 --> 01:41:18,154
Good move, Bee!

1525
01:41:18,155 --> 01:41:21,233
This one's for you, A-holes!

1526
01:41:34,672 --> 01:41:36,256
If you're gonna do something,
you better do it!

1527
01:41:36,257 --> 01:41:38,379
Come on!

1528
01:41:39,343 --> 01:41:43,513
I'm sick of this crap.
You fly. I shoot.

1529
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:46,057
Hey, you better let me
fire this big-ass gun

1530
01:41:46,058 --> 01:41:48,260
- and make this ship go faster!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1531
01:41:50,187 --> 01:41:52,397
Listen up! Crash course.
Tracer guns.

1532
01:41:52,398 --> 01:41:55,191
Punch forward to fire,
slide back to reload.

1533
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:56,359
What?

1534
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,320
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1535
01:41:58,321 --> 01:41:59,863
Wait. What're you talking about?

1536
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:01,197
- I don't know what he means.
- Good luck.

1537
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:03,033
Where are you going?

1538
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:04,986
To lay some hate.

1539
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:15,420
- Say it!
- Okay.

1540
01:42:15,421 --> 01:42:16,713
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1541
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:18,048
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1542
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:19,750
Go!

1543
01:42:31,062 --> 01:42:32,763
Yeah, I got one! Whoo!

1544
01:42:34,023 --> 01:42:35,975
These alien guns kick ass!

1545
01:42:38,611 --> 01:42:40,278
Come on, he's on us!

1546
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:42,356
Bee, you gotta move! Duck!

1547
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:47,365
Bee, fire the gun!

1548
01:42:58,089 --> 01:42:59,589
Uh-oh!

1549
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,291
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1550
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:12,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1551
01:43:15,648 --> 01:43:17,315
That was insane!

1552
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:19,584
Tess, you okay?

1553
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:30,362
Okay. Sir?

1554
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:34,874
You better have insurance!

1555
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:38,461
Insurance?

1556
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:40,171
It's a freaking spaceship.

1557
01:43:40,172 --> 01:43:41,965
You go get insurance on
a freaking spaceship.

1558
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:43,667
Good luck with that, buddy.

1559
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:46,929
Is this your car? Huh?

1560
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:51,808
Sweetie, hand me my alien gun.

1561
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:53,629
Here you go.

1562
01:43:54,103 --> 01:43:55,804
Come here.

1563
01:43:55,813 --> 01:43:58,390
- Trust your dad.
- Okay.

1564
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:08,359
Prepare for interstellar launch.

1565
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:17,876
We're almost ready to separate.
We're almost there.

1566
01:44:17,877 --> 01:44:20,044
- Hurry, he's launching!
- All over it, chief.

1567
01:44:20,045 --> 01:44:23,256
Lockdown will be in deep space
before he realizes I'm gone.

1568
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:25,759
I'm a sucky pilot,
but let's give it a whirl.

1569
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,882
Hell, yeah!

1570
01:44:35,895 --> 01:44:38,188
You CIA guys are really subtle.

1571
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:41,024
What a deft hand. I'm sure
nobody noticed all that.

1572
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:43,902
Look. In a few minutes, there are
gonna be feds all over this place,

1573
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:46,154
and I don't want them
finding our Holy Grail.

1574
01:44:46,155 --> 01:44:49,240
So we're gonna take all our R&D,
we're moving it to our China facility.

1575
01:44:49,241 --> 01:44:50,366
Yeah.

1576
01:44:50,367 --> 01:44:54,370
I want you to bring me the Seed,
but I want you to bring it to me there.

1577
01:44:54,371 --> 01:44:59,626
Mr. Joshua, I would not describe
your product testing as perfected.

1578
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:02,625
We have plenty of time for
improvements in China.

1579
01:45:02,671 --> 01:45:05,924
Sir, Galvatron. He was...

1580
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:07,550
A fiasco.

1581
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:10,879
A farrago. An embarrassment.

1582
01:45:10,888 --> 01:45:13,264
And he spoke. How did that happen?

1583
01:45:13,265 --> 01:45:15,225
Do you know what a
flaw is, Wembley? A flaw?

1584
01:45:15,226 --> 01:45:18,895
A flaw is a total failure.

1585
01:45:18,896 --> 01:45:24,602
I did not have control over my
prototype, and I want to know why!

1586
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:46,923
Let's give Bumblebee the good news.
We got a ship now. We're leaving.

1587
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:51,010
You humans. After all we have done.

1588
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:53,847
You don't know what you've
wrought upon yourselves.

1589
01:45:53,848 --> 01:45:55,932
What? What is it now?
What are you talking about?

1590
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:58,017
I mean, I'm doing stuff
out of my league here!

1591
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:01,396
You don't see who's controlling who.

1592
01:46:01,397 --> 01:46:04,524
Within that manmade
prototype I fought,

1593
01:46:04,525 --> 01:46:07,360
I sensed the presence

1594
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:09,404
of Megatron.

1595
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:12,323
What, the Decepticon that
started the Chicago war?

1596
01:46:12,324 --> 01:46:15,285
How do you think KSI built those
bots in the first place, hmm?

1597
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:16,911
They had a whole mess of

1598
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:20,290
<i>dead Decepticon heads and they
were downloading their minds!</i>

1599
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:22,333
<i>And I was in charge of autopsy duty.</i>

1600
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:25,503
<i>No union, no benefits, no nothing.</i>

1601
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:27,130
<i>They hooked me up to Megatron,</i>

1602
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:29,299
<i>and that mind wasn't as
dead as they thought.</i>

1603
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:31,467
<i>He fed them the science and specs!</i>

1604
01:46:31,468 --> 01:46:34,967
<i>All so they could build
him a brand-new body.</i>

1605
01:46:35,514 --> 01:46:39,639
<i>Then he infected it with his
evil, nasty chromosomes.</i>

1606
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:44,230
<i>They had red, beady eyes.
They got all in my lovely locks.</i>

1607
01:46:44,231 --> 01:46:45,982
<i>Oh, I can smell it right now.</i>

1608
01:46:45,983 --> 01:46:48,685
<i>Total inside custom job!</i>

1609
01:46:49,737 --> 01:46:53,489
KSI might have named the body
the snappy name of Galvatron,

1610
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:56,659
but that's just
Megatron reincarnated!

1611
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:58,411
You knew this and you
didn't warn them?

1612
01:46:58,412 --> 01:47:02,832
Little girl, you can go to a pretty
dark place when you on death row.

1613
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:05,960
He's been playing KSI all this time,

1614
01:47:05,961 --> 01:47:09,255
all so that he could manipulate
them into going after the Seed.

1615
01:47:11,175 --> 01:47:12,383
Wait. The Seed?

1616
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:15,011
Those nasty soldiers
that were chasing us.

1617
01:47:15,012 --> 01:47:16,137
<i>I saw them board the ship,</i>

1618
01:47:16,138 --> 01:47:18,681
<i>and they took something
that they called the Seed.</i>

1619
01:47:18,682 --> 01:47:21,768
Listen. Sixty million years
ago, give or take an eon...

1620
01:47:21,769 --> 01:47:25,688
Thousands of planets were
cyber-formed with Seeds.

1621
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:34,110
<i>They turned your organic life
into our elemental metals.</i>

1622
01:47:34,657 --> 01:47:39,911
<i>Our creators destroyed
your world to make us.</i>

1623
01:47:39,912 --> 01:47:42,956
And that's what Galvatron
wants to happen again.

1624
01:47:42,957 --> 01:47:47,085
He wants to detonate that Seed
in the biggest city and kill millions!

1625
01:47:47,086 --> 01:47:50,588
He's gonna show the world,
"Baby, I'm back."

1626
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:55,093
The blast wave will incinerate
that city into molten metal.

1627
01:47:55,094 --> 01:47:58,304
He'll have enough to
build a massive army

1628
01:47:58,305 --> 01:48:02,225
and annihilate your species forever.

1629
01:48:02,226 --> 01:48:05,228
You dumb, greedy bastards just
brought extinction to yourself.

1630
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:07,897
Not my problem, though.
I'm free at last.

1631
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:10,191
Whole thing worked out
good for me. I'm walking.

1632
01:48:10,192 --> 01:48:13,270
We got to get the Seed
before Galvatron does.

1633
01:48:27,459 --> 01:48:30,787
<i>The Seed is going to be the
salvation of our company.</i>

1634
01:48:31,088 --> 01:48:33,256
We take delivery tonight.

1635
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:36,634
And next month, we detonate
safely in the Mongolian desert.

1636
01:48:36,635 --> 01:48:41,306
And we'll create enough
Transformium for a hundred years.

1637
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:48,104
Dad, I'm tired of
running and stealing.

1638
01:48:48,105 --> 01:48:49,897
Well, a place to sleep.

1639
01:48:49,898 --> 01:48:52,646
Yeah. Just another break-in.

1640
01:48:57,614 --> 01:48:59,657
You know, when I was your age,

1641
01:48:59,992 --> 01:49:03,369
I liked to get a little wild.
I liked cars, girls.

1642
01:49:07,166 --> 01:49:09,417
But then there was Tessa.

1643
01:49:09,418 --> 01:49:11,335
And when she was born,
all I ever wanted out of life

1644
01:49:11,336 --> 01:49:14,130
was for her to be happy
and healthy and safe.

1645
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:18,134
Somehow I thought I'd always
be enough to protect her.

1646
01:49:19,386 --> 01:49:21,304
But I won't be.

1647
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:23,507
I'll never be.

1648
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:27,018
So somebody better be.

1649
01:49:31,273 --> 01:49:33,850
Thanks for being here
today, Lucky Charms.

1650
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:39,280
Well, thanks for not shooting
me when you had the chance.

1651
01:49:39,281 --> 01:49:40,573
Oh, I'll have more.

1652
01:49:42,451 --> 01:49:44,824
Yeah, I can see that.

1653
01:49:45,037 --> 01:49:48,247
We've intercepted the
encrypted communications.

1654
01:49:48,248 --> 01:49:53,377
Joshua Joyce is headed to his
factory in Guangzhou, China.

1655
01:49:53,378 --> 01:49:55,705
Hey, big shot.

1656
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:58,424
Your company's in serious trouble.

1657
01:49:58,425 --> 01:50:00,176
You better have a damn good lawyer.

1658
01:50:00,177 --> 01:50:01,511
<i>Really?</i>

1659
01:50:01,512 --> 01:50:02,553
Well, you better have
a great one 'cause

1660
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:05,181
you're about to be responsible
for the annihilation of a city.

1661
01:50:05,182 --> 01:50:06,474
<i>Now, you listen to me.</i>

1662
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:08,935
<i>Your tech has been hacked.
Your prototypes are infected.</i>

1663
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:11,354
And now Galvatron
is after that Seed.

1664
01:50:11,355 --> 01:50:14,690
<i>Look. I know you have a conscience
because you're an inventor, like me.</i>

1665
01:50:14,691 --> 01:50:17,693
<i>Do not let Galvatron
anywhere near that Seed.</i>

1666
01:50:17,694 --> 01:50:20,863
I control Galvatron. I created him.

1667
01:50:20,864 --> 01:50:23,032
Deep down, I know you know.

1668
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:26,528
<i>Your prototype's
been controlling you.</i>

1669
01:50:29,498 --> 01:50:32,208
How fast can that thing get
us halfway around the world?

1670
01:50:32,209 --> 01:50:35,788
Very. It's a spaceship.

1671
01:50:51,937 --> 01:50:55,732
If we're traveling, now's the time.

1672
01:50:56,567 --> 01:51:00,146
All I want is to have our life back.
It's your call. Whatever you want.

1673
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:08,448
Are we safer on our own,
or are we safer with them?

1674
01:51:17,045 --> 01:51:19,247
She's a keeper.

1675
01:51:19,256 --> 01:51:21,173
Must take after her mom.

1676
01:51:22,134 --> 01:51:24,962
I can't argue with that, kid.

1677
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:28,598
Move! We're retrieving the Seed,

1678
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:31,767
but then we're done
defending the humans.

1679
01:51:31,768 --> 01:51:34,312
What, done? What do
you mean, you're done?

1680
01:51:34,313 --> 01:51:38,187
Means "finished,"
"see ya," "good-bye."

1681
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:55,833
Hijacked part of my ship?
How did you let this happen?

1682
01:51:55,834 --> 01:51:59,128
Shut down dark-matter drive,
reverse course at light speed,

1683
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:00,880
and get us back!

1684
01:52:00,881 --> 01:52:04,008
Prime's taken my trophy case.

1685
01:52:04,009 --> 01:52:07,303
And he will feel my wrath!

1686
01:52:14,186 --> 01:52:15,811
Welcome to China.

1687
01:52:15,812 --> 01:52:18,773
Put Galvatron in containment.
Tell the techs do not activate him.

1688
01:52:18,774 --> 01:52:20,107
Absolutely, sir.

1689
01:52:20,108 --> 01:52:22,685
I WANT SECURITY ON HIGH ALERT.

1690
01:52:25,072 --> 01:52:26,697
Joyce.

1691
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:31,528
I cannot tell you how enthused
I am to deliver this.

1692
01:52:33,372 --> 01:52:36,082
Top of your alien wish list.

1693
01:52:36,083 --> 01:52:39,168
It's yours. Or rather ours.

1694
01:52:41,546 --> 01:52:43,881
I will need to see my advance.

1695
01:52:43,882 --> 01:52:46,550
Five million shares of the company.

1696
01:52:46,551 --> 01:52:48,844
Together, we're gonna
end human warfare.

1697
01:52:48,929 --> 01:52:51,514
<i>We're about to build a
fully automated U.S. Army.</i>

1698
01:52:51,515 --> 01:52:55,059
<i>Just think of all the American
lives we're gonna save.</i>

1699
01:53:03,944 --> 01:53:09,240
ALL OF THESE CARS ARE KSI'S
NEWEST CIVILIAN PROTOTYPE ROBOTS.

1700
01:53:09,241 --> 01:53:12,285
So how soon until we can
start continuous production?

1701
01:53:23,046 --> 01:53:28,092
You know, why don't we take
a beat on this for a minute?

1702
01:53:28,176 --> 01:53:31,053
I have some new data
that I discovered and...

1703
01:53:31,054 --> 01:53:32,221
You're not backing out on me here?

1704
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:34,015
No, I'm not backing out. I just...

1705
01:53:34,016 --> 01:53:36,225
I want the Seed. I'm not
saying I don't want the Seed.

1706
01:53:36,226 --> 01:53:38,477
I'm just saying I don't know if I...

1707
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:40,896
if I want the Seed right now.

1708
01:53:40,897 --> 01:53:44,358
Good men have died trying
to get that thing for us.

1709
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:45,901
For you.

1710
01:53:45,902 --> 01:53:48,070
I know what you did
to get that thing.

1711
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:50,406
A lot of illegal, icky shit.

1712
01:53:50,407 --> 01:53:53,951
I can take you down, too, Mr.
Black Ops. Don't you threaten me.

1713
01:53:54,244 --> 01:53:56,454
I started this company
when I was a boy,

1714
01:53:56,455 --> 01:53:59,206
with a dream of making
the world a better place.

1715
01:53:59,207 --> 01:54:02,581
Funny. I had the same dream.

1716
01:54:02,586 --> 01:54:06,422
Somewhere along the way,
you made billions of dollars.

1717
01:54:06,423 --> 01:54:08,507
So why don't you tell me
what's missing from my dream?

1718
01:54:08,508 --> 01:54:11,802
Why don't you tell me what's
missing from my boyhood dream?

1719
01:54:12,721 --> 01:54:17,308
I have served my country for
decades of unparalleled prosperity

1720
01:54:17,309 --> 01:54:20,227
and you are my golden parachute.

1721
01:54:20,228 --> 01:54:24,523
So you are damn well jumping
out of the plane with me!

1722
01:54:34,951 --> 01:54:38,245
I am Galvatron!

1723
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:46,913
- What's going on?
- Your Galvatron has gone active.

1724
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:49,173
What haven't you been telling me?

1725
01:54:49,174 --> 01:54:52,844
Find Darcy, and bring a car
around downstairs. Quietly.

1726
01:54:53,387 --> 01:54:55,971
We got a factory emergency.
I have to get you out of here.

1727
01:54:55,972 --> 01:54:58,099
- What the hell's going on?
- Take them outside.

1728
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:00,848
We had a deal.
You got what you wanted.

1729
01:55:00,977 --> 01:55:03,350
I got what "it" wanted.

1730
01:55:04,147 --> 01:55:09,110
My brothers, today I
grant you your freedom.

1731
01:55:09,111 --> 01:55:14,533
And from now on,
you are commanded by me.

1732
01:55:14,783 --> 01:55:16,826
Rise up!

1733
01:55:18,161 --> 01:55:21,034
Go find my Seed!

1734
01:55:34,678 --> 01:55:38,723
Detonate the Seed in
the largest city.

1735
01:55:40,016 --> 01:55:41,976
Listen, princess. I don't
wanna hear, "I told you so,"

1736
01:55:41,977 --> 01:55:43,978
but this is much more
dangerous than I think.

1737
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:45,771
Get in.

1738
01:55:51,695 --> 01:55:53,362
Galvatron's hacked into the others.

1739
01:55:53,363 --> 01:55:54,905
- What?
- Joshua.

1740
01:55:54,906 --> 01:55:56,866
- You have to contain this!
- Drive, drive!

1741
01:55:56,867 --> 01:55:58,739
Son of a...

1742
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:03,748
Come on. Let's move,
let's move, let's move!

1743
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:21,056
I know how to lose
them in Hong Kong.

1744
01:56:21,057 --> 01:56:24,260
I know a military garrison
there that will help us.

1745
01:56:24,769 --> 01:56:27,813
Threatening a
professional CIA killer.

1746
01:56:28,064 --> 01:56:30,941
Possibly not my finest hour.
I'd like to have that one back.

1747
01:56:30,942 --> 01:56:33,319
Killer? I thought they
were your friends!

1748
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:36,447
No. Not friends. Business.
They gave me this bomb.

1749
01:56:36,448 --> 01:56:38,115
- Bomb?
- Oh!

1750
01:56:38,116 --> 01:56:39,575
Is there a bomb in the bag?

1751
01:56:39,576 --> 01:56:41,744
Yes, there's a bomb in the bag.

1752
01:56:41,745 --> 01:56:43,537
Shit.

1753
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:55,090
<i>When you said you were
done fighting for humans,</i>

1754
01:56:55,091 --> 01:56:57,301
you didn't mean that, did you?

1755
01:56:57,302 --> 01:57:00,763
How many more of my
kind must be sacrificed

1756
01:57:00,764 --> 01:57:03,307
to atone for your mistakes?

1757
01:57:03,308 --> 01:57:04,600
Well, what do you think
being human means?

1758
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:06,227
That's what we do.

1759
01:57:06,228 --> 01:57:08,430
We make mistakes.

1760
01:57:08,605 --> 01:57:12,184
And sometimes out of those mistakes
come the most amazing things.

1761
01:57:16,738 --> 01:57:20,241
When I fixed you,
it was for a reward.

1762
01:57:20,242 --> 01:57:24,162
That was it.
That was why. For money.

1763
01:57:24,621 --> 01:57:27,540
And it was me making a mistake.

1764
01:57:27,582 --> 01:57:30,535
Without it, you wouldn't be here.

1765
01:57:32,629 --> 01:57:36,590
So even if you got no faith in us,
I'm asking you to do what I do.

1766
01:57:36,591 --> 01:57:39,965
I'm asking you to look at all
the junk and see the treasure.

1767
01:57:40,262 --> 01:57:44,967
You gotta have faith,
Prime, in who we can be.

1768
01:57:56,194 --> 01:57:59,272
I'm seriously pissed we're
not getting paid for this.

1769
01:57:59,531 --> 01:58:02,575
Well, at least we get to kill him.

1770
01:58:02,701 --> 01:58:05,574
They're not getting away
if I still got him on satellite.

1771
01:58:05,662 --> 01:58:09,036
Some genius. Thinks he
can outrun the CIA.

1772
01:58:10,166 --> 01:58:11,625
- Joshua?
- Yes?

1773
01:58:11,626 --> 01:58:13,873
How lethal is that bomb?

1774
01:58:13,878 --> 01:58:16,046
Uh, I don't know. Let me check.

1775
01:58:22,178 --> 01:58:23,387
I love this! This is so good.

1776
01:58:23,388 --> 01:58:25,214
Oh, hang on.

1777
01:58:25,557 --> 01:58:28,851
I'm getting a text from
Il Duce in Hong Kong.

1778
01:58:28,852 --> 01:58:31,312
"Need to know the Seed's
estimated blast range."

1779
01:58:31,313 --> 01:58:33,356
Duh.

1780
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:45,739
I'll do the diversion!
Get that thing somewhere safe!

1781
01:58:50,832 --> 01:58:53,042
Killers are coming!
Guys, we gotta go!

1782
01:58:53,043 --> 01:58:54,251
Guys, guys...

1783
01:58:54,252 --> 01:58:55,878
- Shut up! Shut up!
- All right! I'm sorry!

1784
01:58:55,879 --> 01:58:57,379
All right, go ahead, go ahead!

1785
01:59:00,091 --> 01:59:03,260
Okay, good? No, don't go! Wait!

1786
01:59:03,428 --> 01:59:06,930
Okay, he's in. Okay, okay, okay.

1787
01:59:06,931 --> 01:59:09,016
I need a raise! I want a raise.

1788
01:59:09,017 --> 01:59:10,889
All right, yes! I'm sure
whatever you want!

1789
01:59:14,773 --> 01:59:16,520
Go, go, go!

1790
01:59:18,068 --> 01:59:19,769
Oh, no!

1791
01:59:21,946 --> 01:59:24,319
Death is on our tail!
Death is on our tail!

1792
01:59:30,955 --> 01:59:34,454
Get out of the way, all of you!
Get out of the way!

1793
01:59:35,877 --> 01:59:38,375
I don't want to die like this.

1794
01:59:53,269 --> 01:59:55,471
Box them in.

1795
02:00:08,618 --> 02:00:09,910
Hurry, hurry! Come, come.

1796
02:00:09,911 --> 02:00:12,121
Okay, yes. I'll follow you
anywhere. You're amazing!

1797
02:00:12,122 --> 02:00:13,747
We're going to get you to the roof.

1798
02:00:13,748 --> 02:00:15,449
Good, good.

1799
02:00:20,714 --> 02:00:22,506
Go!

1800
02:00:32,434 --> 02:00:34,807
LOL. That's funny.

1801
02:00:34,978 --> 02:00:36,812
I can't... This is really happening.

1802
02:00:36,813 --> 02:00:41,316
A man, me, who is worth
over 20 billion dollars is now

1803
02:00:41,317 --> 02:00:45,521
being chased by CIA assassins.
That's the truth.

1804
02:00:45,739 --> 02:00:48,737
And in the middle of
a robot uprising.

1805
02:00:50,618 --> 02:00:54,492
And I'm carrying what is,
in essence, a tactical nuke.

1806
02:00:54,622 --> 02:00:57,499
And the great thing is I...
The great thing is that I'm...

1807
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:59,376
I'm barely feeling any jetlag.

1808
02:00:59,377 --> 02:01:01,003
- Just stop it!
- What?

1809
02:01:01,004 --> 02:01:03,046
You need to hide on the
roof of this building.

1810
02:01:03,047 --> 02:01:05,294
I'll get you a
helicopter extraction.

1811
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:09,427
Okay.

1812
02:01:11,681 --> 02:01:13,724
I like her.

1813
02:01:13,725 --> 02:01:15,426
I find her very attractive.

1814
02:01:16,895 --> 02:01:19,354
He's definitely around here.

1815
02:01:19,355 --> 02:01:20,856
Come on, come on.

1816
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:24,818
I got a bike!

1817
02:01:24,819 --> 02:01:26,820
Check in there!

1818
02:01:26,821 --> 02:01:29,523
These are the CIA assassins
I told you about.

1819
02:01:31,284 --> 02:01:32,910
Whoa!

1820
02:01:32,911 --> 02:01:35,158
- Guys.
- Let's go.

1821
02:01:35,747 --> 02:01:37,448
Hello.

1822
02:01:43,463 --> 02:01:45,585
Hey! Okay.

1823
02:01:51,930 --> 02:01:54,007
- Pick it up.
- All right. I'm gonna.

1824
02:02:07,403 --> 02:02:09,150
Wow.

1825
02:02:09,531 --> 02:02:13,450
Wow. Wow, thank you.
Wow! How did you...

1826
02:02:13,451 --> 02:02:16,370
Police training, prior to my MBA.

1827
02:02:16,538 --> 02:02:18,330
I love you.

1828
02:02:19,082 --> 02:02:20,499
Get to the roof.

1829
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:22,201
All right, okay.

1830
02:02:52,407 --> 02:02:54,233
Mmm!

1831
02:03:16,431 --> 02:03:19,600
Find my Seed. It's here!

1832
02:03:19,601 --> 02:03:22,520
Those prototypes are
after that bomb.

1833
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:32,067
No!

1834
02:03:32,196 --> 02:03:34,739
No, no, no, no!

1835
02:03:37,994 --> 02:03:39,661
Who the hell's aboard that?

1836
02:03:39,662 --> 02:03:41,864
Impossible.

1837
02:03:48,838 --> 02:03:54,089
Brothers, it's the Autobots!
Shoot them down!

1838
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,973
Joshua!

1839
02:03:59,974 --> 02:04:01,433
Hey, Baldy!

1840
02:04:01,434 --> 02:04:02,976
Hey, it's me! Hey!

1841
02:04:02,977 --> 02:04:04,769
Bring it over now! Let's go.

1842
02:04:05,188 --> 02:04:07,105
Hurry up, run!

1843
02:04:07,106 --> 02:04:09,107
- Hurry! Come on!
- Let's go! Move it!

1844
02:04:09,108 --> 02:04:12,194
Guys! Come on. Give it to me now!

1845
02:04:12,195 --> 02:04:14,522
Looks like we might have company.

1846
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:26,367
We're hit! We're hit!

1847
02:04:51,651 --> 02:04:55,195
They live, they talk, we're dead.

1848
02:04:55,238 --> 02:04:57,940
- Kill them all.
- Pleasure.

1849
02:04:59,659 --> 02:05:02,453
I count ten below!

1850
02:05:02,912 --> 02:05:05,247
I thought you said you had
one prototype get infected.

1851
02:05:05,248 --> 02:05:07,416
Now he's got operational
control of my other 50.

1852
02:05:07,417 --> 02:05:09,209
Come on.

1853
02:05:10,336 --> 02:05:12,838
Climb, climb!

1854
02:05:12,839 --> 02:05:15,541
Surround them.

1855
02:05:19,429 --> 02:05:22,431
I may have started the apocalypse,
but you brought your family.

1856
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:24,641
And that's, you know,
terrible parenting.

1857
02:05:24,642 --> 02:05:26,268
Oh, I'm about one second
away from knocking you out,

1858
02:05:26,269 --> 02:05:27,644
taking the bomb,
and just leaving you here.

1859
02:05:27,645 --> 02:05:29,521
Please, do me a favor.

1860
02:05:29,522 --> 02:05:32,107
Optimus, Autobots, you alive?

1861
02:05:32,108 --> 02:05:33,900
- Come on, bitch!
- Come on!

1862
02:05:45,747 --> 02:05:47,122
Evac! Evac!

1863
02:05:47,123 --> 02:05:49,245
We're getting flanked!

1864
02:05:50,209 --> 02:05:52,331
We got company below!

1865
02:05:53,379 --> 02:05:54,880
Oh!

1866
02:05:54,881 --> 02:05:59,302
My fat ass is stuck!
Bee, take the shot!

1867
02:06:04,849 --> 02:06:06,596
Oh!

1868
02:06:08,936 --> 02:06:10,562
- Into the elevator! Get in.
- Okay.

1869
02:06:10,563 --> 02:06:12,310
Come on.

1870
02:06:14,984 --> 02:06:17,106
Get down, get down!

1871
02:06:17,111 --> 02:06:19,211
Close the door! Close the door!

1872
02:06:21,449 --> 02:06:23,158
Won't go! It's not closing!

1873
02:06:23,159 --> 02:06:24,659
There's too much weight.

1874
02:06:24,660 --> 02:06:26,495
- Get back down to Bumblebee!
- Dad, no!

1875
02:06:26,496 --> 02:06:29,619
Hey! You want me!

1876
02:06:39,425 --> 02:06:40,675
Center elevator.

1877
02:06:40,676 --> 02:06:42,719
<i>Center elevator.</i>

1878
02:06:46,349 --> 02:06:48,642
He's gonna be okay.

1879
02:07:01,197 --> 02:07:03,990
Alien bomb! Alien bomb,
coming through!

1880
02:07:03,991 --> 02:07:05,784
Clear the way!
Clear the... Hi, kids.

1881
02:07:05,785 --> 02:07:07,536
Coming through, ladies!

1882
02:07:07,537 --> 02:07:09,913
Excuse me! Excuse me,
ladies! Excuse me!

1883
02:07:09,914 --> 02:07:11,081
Oh, my God!

1884
02:07:11,082 --> 02:07:13,750
How do you say, "Get the fuck
out of the way" in Chinese?

1885
02:07:43,948 --> 02:07:45,865
Ahhh!

1886
02:07:57,962 --> 02:08:00,964
That's a long way down.

1887
02:08:03,259 --> 02:08:05,176
You've got to be kidding me.

1888
02:08:06,554 --> 02:08:08,506
No!

1889
02:08:20,484 --> 02:08:22,276
Come on.

1890
02:08:29,368 --> 02:08:31,490
Whoa!

1891
02:08:33,664 --> 02:08:35,707
I'm coming for you!

1892
02:09:10,284 --> 02:09:12,327
Never should have hidden that truck.

1893
02:09:12,328 --> 02:09:14,162
You should have never
came after my family.

1894
02:09:14,163 --> 02:09:17,707
Tough luck, Yeager.
We all have family.

1895
02:09:17,792 --> 02:09:20,039
Yeah, but I'm gonna
live to see mine.

1896
02:09:43,025 --> 02:09:45,902
<i>Where is my escaped bounty?</i>

1897
02:09:45,903 --> 02:09:48,363
Autobots at this location.

1898
02:09:48,364 --> 02:09:50,737
Prime is close.

1899
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:54,119
Do whatever you have to do.

1900
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:57,072
I intend to.

1901
02:09:58,916 --> 02:10:00,750
- Darcy!
- Joshua!

1902
02:10:00,751 --> 02:10:02,043
We got three more
coming in from that way!

1903
02:10:02,044 --> 02:10:04,371
Bee, where's Tessa?

1904
02:10:04,714 --> 02:10:06,415
Dad!

1905
02:10:08,634 --> 02:10:11,928
We got a real dilemma here.
Okay? I created incredible robots.

1906
02:10:11,929 --> 02:10:14,556
It's all designed to kick
that fat Transformer's ass.

1907
02:10:14,557 --> 02:10:17,392
So, really, this is
a no-win situation.

1908
02:10:17,393 --> 02:10:18,727
It's over.

1909
02:10:18,728 --> 02:10:19,936
That was mean.

1910
02:10:19,937 --> 02:10:23,398
Hey! I'm sorry if you can't
handle the cold-hearted truth!

1911
02:10:23,399 --> 02:10:26,192
<i>Optimus, what are my
orders with these humans?</i>

1912
02:10:26,193 --> 02:10:27,610
<i>Can I squish the bald guy?</i>

1913
02:10:27,611 --> 02:10:29,112
They're in trouble.

1914
02:10:29,113 --> 02:10:30,989
Nah! This isn't our fight!

1915
02:10:30,990 --> 02:10:33,867
I'm done being an underdog.
Underdogs suck!

1916
02:10:33,868 --> 02:10:35,785
I say they get what they deserve.

1917
02:10:35,786 --> 02:10:37,454
What's the play, Prime?

1918
02:10:37,455 --> 02:10:41,034
It's time for reinforcements.

1919
02:10:42,668 --> 02:10:46,542
Recognize one of your Knights.

1920
02:11:06,025 --> 02:11:09,319
THE LEGEND EXISTS.

1921
02:11:16,202 --> 02:11:18,279
Come on.

1922
02:11:18,871 --> 02:11:21,122
All right, come on!
Come on, let's go!

1923
02:11:21,123 --> 02:11:22,995
Bee, go!

1924
02:11:26,796 --> 02:11:29,669
Come on, we got to move!
Let's go, move!

1925
02:11:32,718 --> 02:11:35,261
Where's Tessa? Tessa,
get over here! Come on.

1926
02:11:35,262 --> 02:11:37,222
Get over here!

1927
02:11:37,223 --> 02:11:39,224
Stay behind me! I'm covering you!

1928
02:11:39,225 --> 02:11:41,684
If I stop covering you,
it means I'm dead.

1929
02:11:41,685 --> 02:11:43,637
But that ain't gonna happen.

1930
02:11:44,271 --> 02:11:46,314
Take that!

1931
02:11:47,817 --> 02:11:51,020
I'm a wicked warrior robot!

1932
02:11:51,070 --> 02:11:52,404
Goddamn!

1933
02:11:52,405 --> 02:11:54,277
Come on! We gotta move now!

1934
02:11:55,157 --> 02:11:56,949
Go, go!

1935
02:12:02,581 --> 02:12:05,329
We got hostiles coming
down the street!

1936
02:12:06,335 --> 02:12:08,036
Go!

1937
02:12:12,174 --> 02:12:14,876
Bee! Twelve o'clock! Cover fire!

1938
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:20,014
We're surrounded!

1939
02:12:20,015 --> 02:12:21,641
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

1940
02:12:21,642 --> 02:12:23,389
Rocket!

1941
02:12:23,519 --> 02:12:24,727
Go, go, go!

1942
02:12:24,728 --> 02:12:26,554
Get down!

1943
02:12:28,858 --> 02:12:30,525
Oh, this is the perfect
place to hide.

1944
02:12:30,526 --> 02:12:34,547
A big glass box! Nobody will
ever find us here! That's...

1945
02:12:37,074 --> 02:12:39,868
You've got to be kidding me.

1946
02:12:39,869 --> 02:12:44,122
Legendary warriors,
the powers that created us

1947
02:12:44,123 --> 02:12:46,958
now want us all extinguished.

1948
02:12:46,959 --> 02:12:51,960
We must join forces, or else
forever be their slaves.

1949
02:12:52,798 --> 02:12:56,092
So today you stand with us...

1950
02:12:56,093 --> 02:13:00,593
or you stand against me.

1951
02:13:06,896 --> 02:13:08,813
We'll let Prime figure this one out.

1952
02:13:08,814 --> 02:13:10,190
Very wise.

1953
02:13:10,191 --> 02:13:12,775
There's no friggin' way I'm
staying down here with them.

1954
02:13:12,776 --> 02:13:14,728
No way. No way.

1955
02:13:19,450 --> 02:13:23,369
Only together can we survive!

1956
02:13:24,747 --> 02:13:26,790
Let me lead you!

1957
02:13:38,093 --> 02:13:39,427
Oh, no.

1958
02:13:39,428 --> 02:13:41,930
I was expecting a giant car.

1959
02:13:41,931 --> 02:13:43,974
Come here!

1960
02:13:49,438 --> 02:13:51,814
We're giving you freedom.

1961
02:14:07,957 --> 02:14:11,376
You defend my family,

1962
02:14:12,628 --> 02:14:15,080
or die.

1963
02:14:17,383 --> 02:14:19,175
Autobots,

1964
02:14:19,176 --> 02:14:24,507
we're going to prove who
we are and why we're here!

1965
02:14:25,015 --> 02:14:27,475
Ugh, you just want
to die for the guy.

1966
02:14:27,476 --> 02:14:30,728
That's leadership.
Or brainwashing, or something.

1967
02:14:30,729 --> 02:14:35,184
No. That's Optimus Prime.

1968
02:14:40,573 --> 02:14:44,026
Autobots, we charge together!

1969
02:14:44,868 --> 02:14:47,115
Now, roll out!

1970
02:14:48,998 --> 02:14:51,833
We're getting boxed in!
We're getting flanked everywhere!

1971
02:14:51,834 --> 02:14:53,209
Help me out here!

1972
02:14:53,210 --> 02:14:55,002
Kill anything that moves!

1973
02:14:55,421 --> 02:14:57,998
Come on, Cade, shoot!

1974
02:14:59,008 --> 02:15:00,717
Come and get some, you little bitch!

1975
02:15:00,718 --> 02:15:02,761
Incoming!

1976
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:08,558
I can't believe I'm putting
my life in your hands.

1977
02:15:08,559 --> 02:15:09,934
Here. Be my guest. Take the gun.

1978
02:15:09,935 --> 02:15:11,019
- Go ahead, take it.
- No, I don't want the gun.

1979
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:12,186
- Come on, you can lead.
- No, I don't want the gun.

1980
02:15:12,187 --> 02:15:13,771
Then stay under there and shut up!

1981
02:15:13,772 --> 02:15:16,770
All right. You're good with
the gun. So you keep it.

1982
02:15:20,154 --> 02:15:22,614
Running out of guns and ammo.

1983
02:15:22,615 --> 02:15:24,198
Ow!

1984
02:15:30,623 --> 02:15:33,541
Come and get some!

1985
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:36,961
You're all gonna die!

1986
02:15:56,940 --> 02:15:59,142
Way to go, baby!

1987
02:15:59,485 --> 02:16:01,607
Good shooting, Cade!

1988
02:16:02,738 --> 02:16:09,161
I'm like a fat ballerina who
takes scalps and slits throats!

1989
02:16:15,584 --> 02:16:17,877
Got your fortune cookie!

1990
02:16:18,879 --> 02:16:21,001
Come here, you little punk.

1991
02:16:23,759 --> 02:16:27,220
Pull the pin! I'm dying out here!

1992
02:16:27,221 --> 02:16:28,304
Here! Take it. Take it!

1993
02:16:28,305 --> 02:16:30,473
Little help! Little help!

1994
02:16:30,474 --> 02:16:32,058
It's live! It's live,
it's live. Take it!

1995
02:16:32,059 --> 02:16:33,101
What do you want me to do with it?

1996
02:16:33,102 --> 02:16:35,645
- Just throw it!
- Give, give, give!

1997
02:16:49,076 --> 02:16:50,993
Got some bad news, Cade.

1998
02:16:50,994 --> 02:16:54,322
I'm out of ammo and out of ideas.

1999
02:17:03,132 --> 02:17:05,800
Faster! Go!

2000
02:17:12,599 --> 02:17:14,676
I'll kill you!

2001
02:17:43,338 --> 02:17:45,711
Charge!

2002
02:17:56,185 --> 02:17:58,853
No, impossible!

2003
02:17:58,854 --> 02:18:01,852
They're ruining everything!

2004
02:18:02,191 --> 02:18:03,892
Take that!

2005
02:18:10,866 --> 02:18:12,738
Get off me.

2006
02:18:13,702 --> 02:18:15,536
- Get up, Hound!
- I can't go on.

2007
02:18:15,537 --> 02:18:17,205
But you gotta keep fighting!

2008
02:18:17,206 --> 02:18:19,408
Tank's empty, bro.

2009
02:18:19,666 --> 02:18:21,042
There's more of 'em coming.
If you don't get up

2010
02:18:21,043 --> 02:18:23,086
and fight, we're going
to die. Let's go!

2011
02:18:27,716 --> 02:18:29,918
Attack!

2012
02:18:33,263 --> 02:18:35,636
Optimus is here!

2013
02:18:46,068 --> 02:18:48,441
Bee, jump!

2014
02:19:36,743 --> 02:19:38,660
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

2015
02:20:08,275 --> 02:20:10,852
<i>I hate cheap knockoffs.</i>

2016
02:20:12,321 --> 02:20:13,487
Awesome job!

2017
02:20:13,488 --> 02:20:15,448
- You.
- Who?

2018
02:20:15,449 --> 02:20:17,116
- You.
- Step forward.

2019
02:20:17,117 --> 02:20:18,200
Wait. Why?

2020
02:20:18,201 --> 02:20:22,747
Your science will be responsible
for humanity's extinction.

2021
02:20:22,748 --> 02:20:28,002
All right. I know that you're sensitive
to this whole bioethical dilemma.

2022
02:20:28,003 --> 02:20:29,128
Maybe all he wants
to hear you say is

2023
02:20:29,129 --> 02:20:30,671
that some things should
never be invented.

2024
02:20:30,672 --> 02:20:32,440
Ahhh!

2025
02:20:35,344 --> 02:20:36,969
Okay.

2026
02:20:36,970 --> 02:20:38,596
We'll lead you out of the city.

2027
02:20:38,597 --> 02:20:41,766
Get that Seed safely to the hills.

2028
02:20:41,767 --> 02:20:43,392
Use this car.

2029
02:20:43,393 --> 02:20:45,390
He almost ate me!

2030
02:20:47,648 --> 02:20:49,565
All right, we're good!

2031
02:20:49,566 --> 02:20:51,267
All right, let's go!

2032
02:20:52,736 --> 02:20:54,437
Get out of that seat.

2033
02:20:55,322 --> 02:20:57,865
And you're one lucky dad to have me.

2034
02:20:58,825 --> 02:21:02,244
Okay, Lucky Charms. You got that.
You drive. Let's go.

2035
02:21:12,673 --> 02:21:13,881
What did you do?)

2036
02:21:13,882 --> 02:21:16,592
I don't know. I don't know,
but it's an issue.

2037
02:21:16,593 --> 02:21:17,885
- Did you press a button?
- Is it gonna blow up?

2038
02:21:17,886 --> 02:21:19,053
I don't know.

2039
02:21:19,054 --> 02:21:21,305
Your thing is beeping now,
so you must have hit something.

2040
02:21:21,306 --> 02:21:23,140
- Is it gonna blow up?
- I don't know!

2041
02:21:23,141 --> 02:21:25,393
A bomb starts beeping, that might
signal a problem, you think?

2042
02:21:25,394 --> 02:21:28,145
I'm just saying that it's
a steady blinking light,

2043
02:21:28,146 --> 02:21:30,393
which could be a timer of some kind.

2044
02:21:30,732 --> 02:21:33,400
Unless it's signaling location.

2045
02:21:34,069 --> 02:21:35,941
To who?

2046
02:21:43,161 --> 02:21:45,663
We've got to call the central
government for help!

2047
02:21:50,711 --> 02:21:53,539
Optimus Prime.

2048
02:21:54,256 --> 02:21:57,379
Come to me.

2049
02:22:56,485 --> 02:22:57,860
DEFENSE MINISTER...

2050
02:22:57,861 --> 02:22:59,945
...THERE'S A CRISIS IN HONG KONG!

2051
02:23:04,117 --> 02:23:06,827
THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT WILL
PROTECT HONG KONG AT ALL COSTS.

2052
02:23:06,828 --> 02:23:09,201
WE HAVE FIGHTER JETS ON THE WAY.

2053
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:16,871
There's the bridge.

2054
02:23:34,856 --> 02:23:36,357
Back it up! Back it up!

2055
02:23:36,358 --> 02:23:39,985
Go, go, go, go! Back up!
Go back! Go back!

2056
02:23:39,986 --> 02:23:41,570
Move! Get out of
the way. I can't see!

2057
02:23:41,571 --> 02:23:44,273
- Shane, drive faster!
- Okay, just calm down.

2058
02:23:56,044 --> 02:23:57,945
- Shane, watch out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

2059
02:24:00,882 --> 02:24:03,300
- Get cover!
- Back up! Back! Back up!

2060
02:24:07,973 --> 02:24:10,425
Autobots, fall back!

2061
02:24:14,187 --> 02:24:16,021
- Come on, move! Out of my way!
- Get out of the way!

2062
02:24:16,022 --> 02:24:18,315
- Look out!
- Just hit them! Just hit them!

2063
02:24:37,669 --> 02:24:38,919
It's a big magnet!

2064
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:41,293
It's sucking up metal
and dropping it!

2065
02:24:44,009 --> 02:24:45,801
Oh!

2066
02:24:47,596 --> 02:24:48,679
- Go faster! Go faster!
- Move!

2067
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:50,764
- Get out of the way!
- It's coming! It's coming!

2068
02:24:50,765 --> 02:24:52,600
It's coming closer!

2069
02:24:52,601 --> 02:24:54,848
Go faster, Shane!

2070
02:24:56,438 --> 02:24:58,310
Watch out, watch out!

2071
02:24:58,523 --> 02:25:00,441
- Watch out!
- Look out!

2072
02:25:00,442 --> 02:25:02,143
Whoa!

2073
02:25:04,112 --> 02:25:05,938
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2074
02:25:06,114 --> 02:25:09,992
Oh, no, now it's circling back towards us!
Hard right! Take a hard right!

2075
02:25:09,993 --> 02:25:11,493
Move it! Get out of the way!

2076
02:25:11,494 --> 02:25:14,572
Oh, my God!

2077
02:25:28,637 --> 02:25:31,305
Oh, no. No, the magnet.
Get out, get out!

2078
02:25:31,306 --> 02:25:34,266
Come on! Come here! Get out!

2079
02:25:35,435 --> 02:25:37,394
No, no, no! No, we're
going up. Grab the bomb!

2080
02:25:37,395 --> 02:25:38,812
Help me grab the bomb!

2081
02:25:38,813 --> 02:25:40,064
I can't get the seat belt off!

2082
02:25:40,065 --> 02:25:41,815
Pull me down! Catch me!

2083
02:25:41,816 --> 02:25:43,484
I'm going up! I'm going up!

2084
02:25:43,485 --> 02:25:45,194
Get me! Grab me!

2085
02:25:46,655 --> 02:25:48,405
Pull me down! Pull me!

2086
02:25:48,406 --> 02:25:49,823
I can't get the seat belt off!

2087
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:52,117
I can't get the belt off!

2088
02:25:52,494 --> 02:25:54,696
I'm stuck! I'm stuck!

2089
02:25:55,163 --> 02:25:56,664
Hold the bomb! I can't hold on!

2090
02:25:57,791 --> 02:25:58,999
Pull!

2091
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,043
Guys, it's crushing me!

2092
02:26:12,514 --> 02:26:14,181
Car!

2093
02:26:14,182 --> 02:26:16,008
Move!

2094
02:26:19,145 --> 02:26:20,521
Shane!

2095
02:26:20,522 --> 02:26:22,773
- Shane!
- I'm good! I'm good.

2096
02:26:22,774 --> 02:26:24,521
I'm good.

2097
02:26:29,906 --> 02:26:31,607
Bumblebee!

2098
02:26:34,077 --> 02:26:36,245
<i>Hey, you guys!</i>

2099
02:26:36,329 --> 02:26:37,538
<i>Yee-hah!</i>

2100
02:26:37,539 --> 02:26:39,240
Come on.

2101
02:26:40,041 --> 02:26:41,583
Go find someplace safe.

2102
02:26:41,584 --> 02:26:43,581
I'm proud of you.

2103
02:26:57,267 --> 02:26:59,059
Get cover!

2104
02:27:03,690 --> 02:27:05,482
Cade!

2105
02:27:06,067 --> 02:27:10,446
Autobots, get this bomb over
the bridge and out of the city!

2106
02:27:10,447 --> 02:27:12,156
Dad!

2107
02:27:12,157 --> 02:27:14,325
What? Come on.

2108
02:28:10,298 --> 02:28:12,674
I got it! I'm getting
this bomb out of here!

2109
02:28:12,675 --> 02:28:14,547
Give me the gun.

2110
02:28:14,886 --> 02:28:17,680
It's you and me now!

2111
02:28:23,186 --> 02:28:24,353
Look, Optimus is out
there all alone.

2112
02:28:24,354 --> 02:28:25,771
What? You can't help him.

2113
02:28:25,772 --> 02:28:27,314
I have to, Tess.
He came back for us.

2114
02:28:27,315 --> 02:28:28,649
Dad, don't leave, please.

2115
02:28:28,650 --> 02:28:30,317
Look, I'll find you,
I'll get there, okay?

2116
02:28:30,318 --> 02:28:31,652
Dad, no, you'll die!

2117
02:28:31,653 --> 02:28:33,612
You gotta stay with Shane.
You're gonna be okay.

2118
02:28:33,613 --> 02:28:34,780
You promise me you're
gonna keep her safe,

2119
02:28:34,781 --> 02:28:37,157
rest of her life, until the
end of time! Promise me!

2120
02:28:37,158 --> 02:28:38,992
I promise you.

2121
02:28:38,993 --> 02:28:40,494
You're the best thing
I ever made, Tess.

2122
02:28:40,495 --> 02:28:42,538
All right, don't ever forget it,
it was always you.

2123
02:28:42,539 --> 02:28:44,581
- I love you.
- Please.

2124
02:28:44,582 --> 02:28:46,083
Get in the car, now.

2125
02:28:46,084 --> 02:28:47,956
Dad!

2126
02:28:56,886 --> 02:28:59,429
Prime!

2127
02:29:24,914 --> 02:29:27,082
Stop the car!

2128
02:29:27,292 --> 02:29:29,915
<i>- You better listen.</i>
- No, you listen.

2129
02:29:30,545 --> 02:29:33,122
I'm not leaving my dad.

2130
02:29:44,225 --> 02:29:48,600
All right, we're gonna hold the
line, then block the bridge!

2131
02:30:16,674 --> 02:30:18,926
You see, it takes
patience to make a man.

2132
02:30:18,927 --> 02:30:22,471
The patience to watch and wait,
to protect all of us, quietly,

2133
02:30:22,472 --> 02:30:25,971
for God and country,
without any recognition at all!

2134
02:30:30,605 --> 02:30:32,022
Cade!

2135
02:30:32,023 --> 02:30:36,109
There are no good aliens!
Or bad aliens, Yeager.

2136
02:30:36,110 --> 02:30:38,737
It's just us and them.

2137
02:30:38,738 --> 02:30:40,815
And you chose them.

2138
02:30:46,538 --> 02:30:48,239
Anytime.

2139
02:30:58,967 --> 02:31:02,427
You saved the human
instead of saving yourself?

2140
02:31:02,428 --> 02:31:05,347
You bring shame upon us all.

2141
02:31:20,071 --> 02:31:22,865
She never listens. Never.

2142
02:31:25,326 --> 02:31:28,199
I gave you an order!

2143
02:31:41,259 --> 02:31:43,093
Get out of here, now!

2144
02:31:43,094 --> 02:31:44,678
Get in. Get in.

2145
02:31:44,679 --> 02:31:47,552
Hey, you! Hey!

2146
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:53,726
Cade, get out of here!
This is my fight!

2147
02:31:55,440 --> 02:32:00,566
It's my fight,
and you're all gonna die!

2148
02:32:08,953 --> 02:32:11,204
Go! Go!

2149
02:32:11,205 --> 02:32:12,456
Come on! Come on!

2150
02:32:18,713 --> 02:32:21,086
Yeah! Killer robot, my ass!

2151
02:32:28,640 --> 02:32:30,842
Whoo!

2152
02:32:38,608 --> 02:32:40,355
Come on.

2153
02:32:47,825 --> 02:32:49,242
Get away, all of you!

2154
02:32:50,536 --> 02:32:53,113
Come on, Tess. Come on,
Tess. Come on, Tess.

2155
02:33:00,421 --> 02:33:02,122
Drive!

2156
02:33:04,342 --> 02:33:06,968
- You see my face, your life is done!
- Oh!

2157
02:33:06,969 --> 02:33:08,670
Come on, come on, come on!

2158
02:33:24,612 --> 02:33:26,313
Yeah!

2159
02:33:27,532 --> 02:33:30,576
Honor to the end.

2160
02:33:31,703 --> 02:33:33,655
You still happy we met?

2161
02:33:38,292 --> 02:33:39,993
Always.

2162
02:33:46,843 --> 02:33:48,544
Hurry!

2163
02:33:49,303 --> 02:33:51,888
Quickly! I'm setting off
Lockdown's grenade!

2164
02:33:51,889 --> 02:33:53,590
Hold tight!

2165
02:34:09,574 --> 02:34:15,872
We shall meet again,
Prime, for I am reborn.

2166
02:34:30,845 --> 02:34:33,547
Kind of nice being your
hero for a change.

2167
02:34:34,182 --> 02:34:37,385
You always were. All my life.

2168
02:34:38,186 --> 02:34:39,887
I love you.

2169
02:34:40,396 --> 02:34:42,268
I love you, too.

2170
02:34:42,857 --> 02:34:44,934
Let's go home to graduation, huh?

2171
02:34:45,401 --> 02:34:47,027
Yeah.

2172
02:34:47,028 --> 02:34:48,695
You're okay, kid.

2173
02:34:48,696 --> 02:34:52,115
Come here, you're all right.
You're all right.

2174
02:34:55,036 --> 02:34:57,037
We don't have a home, Dad.

2175
02:34:57,038 --> 02:34:58,955
It blew up.

2176
02:35:02,877 --> 02:35:05,671
I might be able to
help you with that.

2177
02:35:10,927 --> 02:35:12,385
Brave warriors...

2178
02:35:13,471 --> 02:35:15,764
...you are free!

2179
02:35:16,474 --> 02:35:19,597
I'll ride with you anytime, Spike!

2180
02:35:38,329 --> 02:35:40,531
Did you miss me?

2181
02:35:40,581 --> 02:35:42,453
No.

2182
02:35:43,835 --> 02:35:49,172
This Seed belongs to our
creators, whoever they are.

2183
02:35:49,173 --> 02:35:52,251
There remains a price on my head.

2184
02:35:52,468 --> 02:35:56,012
I endanger you all if I stay.

2185
02:35:56,639 --> 02:36:00,684
I shall take it where
it can never be found.

2186
02:36:01,561 --> 02:36:03,395
Will we ever see you again?

2187
02:36:03,396 --> 02:36:04,938
Cade Yeager,

2188
02:36:04,939 --> 02:36:07,440
I do not know.

2189
02:36:07,441 --> 02:36:10,777
But whenever you look to the stars,

2190
02:36:10,778 --> 02:36:13,697
think of one of them

2191
02:36:13,990 --> 02:36:16,488
as my soul.

2192
02:36:17,159 --> 02:36:20,703
Defend this family, Autobots,

2193
02:36:21,497 --> 02:36:24,370
as they have you.

2194
02:36:24,709 --> 02:36:27,294
Defend

2195
02:36:27,295 --> 02:36:30,089
all they can be.

2196
02:36:36,721 --> 02:36:39,097
<i>There are mysteries to the universe</i>

2197
02:36:39,098 --> 02:36:42,221
<i>we were never meant to solve.</i>

2198
02:36:42,685 --> 02:36:47,390
<i>But who we are and why we are here</i>

2199
02:36:47,565 --> 02:36:50,191
<i>are not among them.</i>

2200
02:36:50,192 --> 02:36:54,942
<i>Those answers we carry inside.</i>

2201
02:36:55,072 --> 02:36:57,824
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

2202
02:36:57,825 --> 02:37:01,328
<i>and this message is to my creators:</i>

2203
02:37:01,329 --> 02:37:04,873
<i>Leave planet Earth alone.</i>

2204
02:37:05,041 --> 02:37:07,083
<i>'Cause I'm coming</i>

2205
02:37:07,084 --> 02:37:09,252
<i>for you.</i>
