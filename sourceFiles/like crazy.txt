00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,046
<i>[woman]
Publications like Rolling Stone and Spare Rib</i>

2
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,011
were created to feed the need

3
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:52,019
for alternative narratives from the
established newspapers of the day.

4
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:56,432
In much the same way, the Pauper <i>Press</i>
of the 1790s in England was developed

5
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,727
out of a need for mass representation
for the popular classes.

6
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,818
Those magazines and fanzines
of the '60s and '70s also provided

7
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,858
a means of reaching
beyond the official

8
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,449
and thus, ultimately,
beyond the ruling classes.

9
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,737
The Internet, in contrast,

10
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,248
no longer requires there to be
any notion of the group.

11
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,290
Its concern is wholly
with the individual.

12
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,040
It is with lucrative serendipity,
or perhaps just good branding,

13
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,004
that Myspace is so called.

14
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,589
The juxtaposition suggests
that the act of the individual

15
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,596
in defining their cyberspace
borders is more important

16
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,679
than what it is filled with.
It is simply 'your space.'.

17
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,015
For the end of monetized
mass communication

18
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,181
is the end of the press baron
champagne baths.

19
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:42,611
[man] Thank you, Anna.
Very provocative. Well done.

20
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,240

have a presentation to make?

22
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,697
[man] All right, make sure you turn
in your final packet to Jacob.

23
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,831
And thank you very much.

24
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,412
Hi.

25
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,378
I don't need to give you mine,
because I've already done it.

26
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,962
[Jacob] Cool.
- Cool.

27
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,216

28
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,976
If she comes to invite
wearing the same dress as me,

29
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,388
- I will completely freak out!
- Hey, yeah... yeah.

30
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,807
No, it was OK.

31
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,983
It was fine.

I really miss you so much.</i>

33

Mum, can you just...

34
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,700
I'll speak to you in a minute. I have
someone waiting on the other line.

35
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,459
<i>All right, darling. I miss you.</i>

36
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,291

38
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,587
- Hello?
[man] Hi, Anna?

39
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,050
<i>- It's Jacob.
- Hi.</i>

40
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,063
[Anna] It didn't freak you out?

41
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,188
I guess you wouldn't
be here if it had.

42
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,229
No, it was nice.
And it was funny.

43
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:52,275
It was kind of great. I don't think
you're a nutcase, by the way, at all.

44
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,318
I thought I'd better
put that, just in case.

45
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,829
- That was a good disclaimer.
- Yeah, I just wanted to set that out.

46
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,082
- "No nutcases here."
- Yeah.

47
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,208
[laughs]
- Whoa.

48
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,753
These cups are huge.
They're like reservoirs.

49
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,715
It's almost bigger
than my face. [giggles]

50
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,591
Yeah, so what do you...
What's your major?

51
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,852
Furniture design.

52
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,808
That's why you're always drawing.

53
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,439
Yeah. You like to write then?

54
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,692
Yeah, yeah. I mean,

55
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,946
journalism is probably what I
would want to kind of go into

56
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,606
when I graduate. I don't know.

57
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:37,779
Who knows what we're going
to do when we leave.

58
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,788
You mean permanently when we leave?
Like when we're dead? We'll be dead.

59
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,370
[laughs] When we leave.
When we depart this planet.

[both laugh]

61
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,018
So are you going to
stay in LA after school?

62
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:04,555
Yeah, I'd like to,
if I can sort out my visa stuff.

63
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,642
So you grew up with
your mum and dad?

64
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,153
- My mom.
- And your dad?

65
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,279
He passed away when I was ten.

66
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:17,693
[Anna] Now, that's shitty.
- Yeah. It's quite shitty.

67
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,038
And what about you?

68
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,746
Yeah, my parents,
I'm very close to them.

69
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,502
It's only ever been...
I'm an only child, so...

70
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,504
Me, too.

71
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,126
Yeah, so I'm quite close to them.

72
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,044
But it's nice being away.

73
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,464
I think it's important to...

74
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,976
to get away from where you've
grown up for some of your life.

75
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,184
I was thinking about
leaving right now, actually.

76
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,852
[laughs]

77
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,363
Let's go.
Where do you want to go?

78
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,952
Um, do you want to come up?

79
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,865
[whispering] She likes
to go to bed early.

80
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,329
Oh, no, that's terrible!

81
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,541
So I try not to make too much noise.
Do you want a drink?

82
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,377
I only have whiskey.

83
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,758
Yeah.

84
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:22,474
- I don't drink much... actually.
[liquid pours]

85
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,052

87
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,146
- It's strong. [laughs]
- Mm.

88
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,527
- Is that the chair where you write?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,997
It's not very comfortable.

90
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,331
[laughs] It does the job.

91
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,507
- You like Paul Simon?
- Yeah.

92
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,544
- Do you?
- Yeah, I love Paul Simon.

93
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,838

- Yeah, I love Graceland.

What do you want me to read?

99
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,188
Something you wrote.

OK.

"I thought I understood it."

106
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,520
That I could grasp it.
But I didn't.

107
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,805
Not really.

108
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,316
Only the 'smudgeness' of it.

109

The pink-slippered, all-containered,
semi-precious eagerness of it.

I didn't realize it would
sometimes be more than whole.

111
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,994
That the wholeness
was a rather luxurious idea.

112
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,535
Because it's the halves
that halve you in half.

113
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,002
Didn't know. Don't know
about the in-between bits.

"The gory bits of you
and gory bits of me."

to something much nicer.

Just a flavor of whiskey
that you know. This...

517

is a single malt, and it's
been in casks for 12 years.

518

And I know that because it
<i>says</i> so right on the bottle!

whole immigration thing was sorted out.

528

[Bernard] Because I know Harry

529
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,227
has been a bit of a slowpoke
handling this stuff,

530
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,765

you have to play by the book.

[Anna] Do we have to go over it again?

534
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:22,281

- We've been through it so many times.

535
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,286
[Bernard] But why not go
for an easier solution?

536
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,618
- Bernard.
- If you two got married,

537
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,873
it'd save me a lot of money.

[mother] Sorry.

of the whiskey, all right?

I was working in New York at Nylon mag,

617

and my husband was in Los Angeles
so he was driving across country.

these pictures of himself and the dog

and then I can come back.
And then we can be together.

we went to see him in concert.

Well, I want to tell you
that I don't doubt the authenticity

of your relationship. However, what is
at issue... I see here...

four, is it, appeals.

772
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,350
These are the official documents dealing
with the violation of the student visa.

773
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:02,813
And this imposed a ban.

774
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:08,026
And that, unfortunately is the...
comes down to the reason

775
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:12,989
that I can't process your application
for marriage visa, nor lift the ban.

776
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,700
It has to come from
the student visa office.

777
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:20,117
Yeah, but we've already applied several
times throughout the last couple years,

778
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,708
as you can see. So I don't know how
many times you expect us to do it.

780

We were told...
I was told by my lawyer

781
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:30,048
that this would be dealt
with separately

782
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,963
from the visa violation,
which is why we're here.

783
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,178
- We've appealed four times.
[woman] He was misinformed.

784
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,934
- That is what is in the way.
- This is a separate situation.

785
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:41,222
Then I want to know who he spoke to,
because we speak to someone different

786
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,061
- every single time.
[Anna] Should there not be one person

who's dealing
with our particular application?

01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,026

process this right now,

789
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,109
but it is not up to me,

790
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:53,742
and I will handle it as soon
as I get a lift on the ban.

- Why did you just walk off?

796
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,089
I didn't. I went to look at something,

797
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,797
and then I turned around
and you were gone.

798

- Whatever. What do you want to do?

to get something to eat?

Sure.

- You shouldn't read my text messages.
- Why did you just shout at me?

842
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,260
- I'm sorry that I shouted.
- Don't raise your voice at me.

843
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,797
People are gonna come around
if you keep shouting.

844
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:25,964
Oh, my God.

845
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:28,008
It's really important
if people come around.

846
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,892
Who's gonna come around? Simon?

847
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,654
Did you sleep with him?

848
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:44,282
- Did you? Tell me.
- Don't touch me.

849
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,694
- Jacob, don't touch me!
- Did you sleep with him, yes or no?!

850
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,578
- Did you?
- Jacob, don't.

851
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:51,865
"Jacob, don't" what?! Did you,
yes or no? It's very simple.

852
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:55,956
Very simple question,
very simple answer, yes or no. Did you?

853
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,133
I'm not answering your questions.

854
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,298
Why can't you look at me and tell me?

855
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:10,809
- Look at me and tell me!
- Don't shout!

856
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,561
- I'll shout if I want to shout.
- No, you won't shout in my house.

857
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,189
All right then!
I'll go back to my house!

858
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,850
- Yeah.
- I'd love to go back to my house!

859
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:21,065
- I'd go right now if I could!
- Why are you shouting at me?!

860
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,150
I don't understand why
you can say things like that!

861
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:26,317
- Don't shout!
- Yes, I'd rather fucking be there!

[Jacob] Who said I was
terrified of heights?

869
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:53,403
- It was just that one time. One time.
- I've seen you on a Ferris wheel.

870
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,038
That Ferris wheel was shaking

871
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:58,245
in a way that Ferris
wheels aren't supposed to shake.

872
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:04,673
[Anna] Did you want to see me?
- Yes.

873
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:08,176
I wanted to know how my new
junior editor was doing.

- Yes.

- No, I haven't, actually.

- Bring them around.

- Are you done?
- You sure?

Yeah, yeah. I'm ready to go.
I've got my shoes on and everything.

916
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,885
I'd better just get my coat.

917
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:26,142
OK. Do you want me
to meet you downstairs?

918

Yeah, I'll meet you down there.
Give me two seconds.

Hi.

920
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:41,236
[Samantha] Your breakfast.
- Oh, man.

921
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:44,152
- How long have you been up?
- An hour and a half.

922
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:47,572
Thank you. Even though I know
I don't get to eat the bacon.

923

- Bernard.

01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,571
[Bernard] What?
- New rules.

969

[Simon] Yeah, it's bad for your skin.

[Bernard] It is?
[Anna] I am on a very tough,

[Simon] Yeah, it's called Simon Says.

Yeah, we have her up at 6:30 now.

- Every morning, running.
- No.

- Every morning?
[mother] That's what it is!

- You do look different.
- Even more than usual.

that has ever

- got Anna to do any exercise.

but all right.

A bit of oats
and some egg whites in there.

- You have changed.
- A sprinkle of cinnamon, no sugar.

989
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:15,492
- You have changed!
- If you want to lose weight, no sugar.

990
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:19,158
That would be it. Everything's moving in
the right direction. I'm really happy.

991
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,836
- This is delicious.
[Anna] It's good, isn't it?

992
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,372
It's very, very good.

993
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:25,710
[mother] Are we going
to play Balderdash?

994
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:28,046
- Oh, yes!
- That'll keep us going.

995
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:30,837
- Actually, the night is young.
- Yeah, we can play Balderdash.

996
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:33,677
[Bernard] Oh, lovely!
- But just before, um...

997
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:37,393
I just want to say
thank you for coming over.

998
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:40,430
- It's been a really special evening.
[Anna] Thanks for coming.

999
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,145
[mother] Thanks to you for
inviting us, my goodness!

1000
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:47,486
I just...
You know, I like to think of life

1001
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,898
as a bit of a puzzle.

1002
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,819
- A jigsaw.
- Oh, no. He's going to make a speech.

1003
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:55,281
Just stick with me on this.

1004
01:16:57,113 --> 01:17:00,788
And, um, for the longest time
there was always one piece missing.

A big piece in the middle.
And I looked around forever.

1006
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:07,882
And I just couldn't find it.

1007
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:12,795
So, um, along comes Anna.

1008
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:16,136
And can I just
commend you two on producing

1009
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,051
such a wonderful young woman?

1010
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:21,016
She's pretty exceptional.

1011
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:23,806
I mean, we've only been
together, what, six months?

1012
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:27,815
But I've known
her almost three years,

1013
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:32,073
and she just fit this... puzzle.

1014
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:33,448
[chuckles]

1015
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,781
The picture was,
from my angle, complete.

1016
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,968
You're beautiful, driven, intelligent.

1017
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:54,128
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1018
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:01,803
Will you marry me?

1019
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:09,811
Listen, I know there's a lot of
things to be worked out here.

1020
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:13,857
I know that there's issues
that need to be ironed out.

1021
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:18,403
But it's very important to me that you
know how much I love your daughter.

1022
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:20,697
Darling, that's really sweet.

1023
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:28,334
I think, um...
[laughs nervously]

1024
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:31,715
- Yeah, maybe, um...
[Bernard] I'll get my jacket.

1025
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:35,549
- Yes, and my handbag, darling?
- Absolutely. Of course.

1026
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,179
[mother] It's late, we have to be going.

1027
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:39,011
[Bernard] Got to get up early
for work anyway.

1028
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:41,642
[mother] Yeah, it's been...
lovely.

1029
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,347
[Bernard] Absolutely.

It was a pleasure.

1033
01:18:57,149 --> 01:19:00,153
- Take care.
- Good night, Dad.

1034
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:03,156
All right. Come on, let's go.

- Hello. Oh, no!
- These are for you.

1042

Thank you. Oh, they're lovely.

1043

- How was your flight?
- It was good, yeah. Long.

1044
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:31,220
Are you tired?

1045
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:34,894
Uh... a bit.

Nothing.

1055
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:41,336
Maybe we could have...
a drink to celebrate.

1056
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:43,341
Great.

God, I haven't drank for ages.

- Well, not this.

Laphroaig.

Ls there anything in that?

[Anna] That's good.
- I'm just, you know, sketching.
