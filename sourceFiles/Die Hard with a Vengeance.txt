2323
01:58:58,604 --> 01:58:59,832
Where you going?

2324
01:58:59,938 --> 01:59:01,269
I'll get his attention.

2325
01:59:20,426 --> 01:59:22,121
Shit.

2326
01:59:22,227 --> 01:59:24,024
This keeps getting
better and better.

2327
01:59:29,168 --> 01:59:30,567
I had no idea

2328
01:59:30,669 --> 01:59:33,103
Canada could be
this much fun.

2329
01:59:37,376 --> 01:59:40,368
Just give me something
to shoot at.

2330
01:59:40,479 --> 01:59:41,878
Come on, hotshot.

2331
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:44,278
Show me that smiling face.

2332
02:00:05,637 --> 02:00:07,502
Say hello to your brother.

2333
02:00:09,641 --> 02:00:11,233
Get out of here!

2334
02:00:27,426 --> 02:00:29,724
Yippee-ki-yay,
motherfucker.

2335
02:00:32,865 --> 02:00:35,265
Looks like you got
his attention.

2336
02:00:35,367 --> 02:00:36,959
Yeah, looks like it.

2337
02:00:38,871 --> 02:00:41,271
Think we should call
a fire truck?

2338
02:00:41,373 --> 02:00:42,840
Fuck them.
Let him cook.

2339
02:00:45,577 --> 02:00:47,135
Oh, shit!

2340
02:00:47,246 --> 02:00:48,770
What?

2341
02:00:48,881 --> 02:00:50,246
What?

2342
02:00:50,349 --> 02:00:52,749
I left Holly
hanging on hold.

2343
02:00:52,851 --> 02:00:54,250
Aw, call her back.

2344
02:00:54,353 --> 02:00:55,752
I don't know.

2345
02:00:55,854 --> 02:00:57,879
She's going to be pissed.

2346
02:00:58,023 --> 02:00:59,615
She'll get over it.

2347
02:00:59,725 --> 02:01:02,455
I don't know, Zeus.

2348
02:01:02,561 --> 02:01:03,960
Like I said,

2349
02:01:04,062 --> 02:01:05,962
she's a very stubborn woman.

2350
02:01:06,064 --> 02:01:09,295
She'd have to be
to stay married to you.

2351
02:01:09,401 --> 02:01:11,301
Ha ha ha!

2352
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:22,000
