1
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,162
Okay, I'm going to ask you
to take a deep breath in.

2
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,044
And you can let it go.

3
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,326
Should I
do it again?

4
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,011
No, one is good.

5
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,525
<i>...upset about?
Apparently...</i>

6
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,523
...we had this fundraiser...

7
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,291
...and I brought cupcakes,
she brought cake pops.

8
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,442
And she's like,
"That's too similar."

9
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,522
I'm like,
"No, a cupcake is a cupcake.

10
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,847
A cake pop is cake
with a stick in it."

11
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,367
Cynthia? I'm going to ask you
to scooch down the table...

12
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,522
Mmm-hmm.
...and turn over, please.

13
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,085
We are grown women and we're
fighting about cake pops.

14
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,204
Let's get over it already!
But the real issue is...

15
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,681
...her daughter Alicia
is a very nice girl,

16
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,962
but not very smart,
whereas my daughter...

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,280
Hey, Eva.
Nice to see you.

18
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,403
Hey.
Come on up.

19
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,961
How's everything?
Great.

20
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,571
Excuse me.

21
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,161
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,165
Where are you going?

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,450
To a party with
Sarah and Will,

24
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,249
so they don't
have to be alone.

25
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,601
Want to come?

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,171
Why?

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,571
Because you're leaving soon,
and I want to be with you.

28
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,321
I'm good, thanks.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,162
Have fun.
Thanks, honey.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,321
<i>She's driving
us totally crazy.</i>

31
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,606
We can't
find anything.

32
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,922
She puts things in
the weirdest places.

33
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,242
Like, if I leave my
bracelet in the kitchen,

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,522
she'll put it in
a kitchen drawer!

35
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,285
Why can't you just do it?

36
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,000
I always do it. I fired the gardener.
It's not fair.

37
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,203
We want to fire her,
and he won't do it.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,526
It's not hard for you. Why
does it have to be fair?

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,761
You should do it because
it's hard for you.

40
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,126
Oh, please.

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,203
You're a grownup.
You can fire a maid.

42
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,771
That's the definition
of maturity?

43
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,882
Firing your
friggin' maid?

44
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,521
Sarah, is this
color good on me?

45
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,131
You look good.
You look pretty.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,727
That's good.
That's a nice look.

47
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,724
Whose party
is this, anyway?

48
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,646
He's a book editor and she's an interior
designer. They know everybody.

49
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,882
Maybe some single men are here.
No.

50
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,122
Oh, shit,
I see a patient.

51
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,050
Oh,
will you show me?

52
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,481
Show me who.

53
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,925
Come on, introduce me.
Stop looking. No.

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,561
God, you're such
a wet blanket.

55
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,884
Oh, lookit! There's that
lady from my gym. What is...

56
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,571
Okay, bye.
Bye.

57
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,404
What is her name?

58
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,251
Oh, it's Hilary.

59
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,722
Hilary? Hilary!

60
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,401
Eva! Hi.

61
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,244
It's so weird
to see you here.

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,686
Eva, this is Marianne.
Marianne, Eva.

63
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,684
How are you? Good.
Nice to meet you.

64
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,921
Nice to meet you.

65
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,084
Eva is an incredible,
incredible masseuse.

66
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,084
Wonderful.
Thank you very much.

67
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,688
Excuse me a second.
I have, I have to find a bathroom.

68
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,771
That was abrupt.

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,922
Oh, my goodness! Look at
those shoes and that outfit.

70
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,521
With the purse?
It looks so nice.

71
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,684
Thank you. I should
bring you everywhere.

72
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,287
I love your outfit, too. Oh.

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,806
So you're a masseuse?

74
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,121
I am, yeah.

75
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,287
Yeah?

76
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,691
And what is it you do?

77
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,961
I'm a poet.

78
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,884
Oh. And I'm a dreamer.

79
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,121
No, really.

80
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,601
You're really a poet?

81
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,807
I am.

82
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,451
You do it for a living?

83
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,290
I do.
Wow!

84
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,804
You do, I don't. You're
a poet, now I know it.

85
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,281
Good one.

86
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,404
Feel free to steal it.

87
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,805
Can I give that to you?
Thank you.

88
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,690
Guess what?

89
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,683
What? I think I just
got a new client.

90
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,325
Yeah? Where?

91
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,364
Ah, right there.

92
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,971
She looks clean.

93
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,244
She's really nice and funny,
she's got great taste.

94
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,323
And very attractive.

95
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,322
I bet you think all the
women here are attractive.

96
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,731
Pretty much.

97
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,486
Hold this. There's not one man
at this party I'm attracted to.

98
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,767
Will.

99
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,844
Hey! Jason!

100
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,320
This is Albert.
Hi.

101
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,085
How's it going?
How are you? Hi.

102
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,687
So, this is a nice party. Got all
the nice white balls hanging down.

103
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,568
Eva was just telling
me that there are

104
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,682
no men at the party
she's attracted to.

105
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,041
Okay.

106
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,006
I don't know why you would
make that announcement, but...

107
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,161
Is that unusual?

108
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,364
No, actually, it's not unusual.
No offense.

109
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,922
No, that's okay. There's no one
here I'm attracted to, either.

110
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,044
Yeah, it's kind of
an ugly crowd, really.

111
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,682
Jason, you have a kid
in college, right?

112
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,371
Two. Yeah.

113
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,761
I have one
leaving in the fall.

114
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,041
I do, too!

115
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,364
That's all I have.
Me, too.

116
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,122
Come on. Your kids are supposed
to go away. That's healthy.

117
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,805
No. Shut up.

118
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,051
Yeah, shut up.

119
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,723
Do the guys get boners? No.

120
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,962
Haven't we been over this? Yes.

121
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,123
I get so nervous
with massages.

122
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,209
I'm afraid I'm
going to get a boner.

123
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,131
You are?
Absolutely. Absolutely.

124
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,481
Do they hit on you?

125
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,246
Okay, you're starting
to depress me.

126
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,721
No, they don't hit on me.
They don't get boners, either.

127
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,927
I do have one guy who has like a
hundred stairs going up to his house...

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,402
...and he never helps me
carry my massage table.

129
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,085
Did you ever
ask him to?

130
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,163
She shouldn't have to!
No, I shouldn't have to!

131
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,402
Bye, guys.
Thank you. Love you.

132
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,281
Bye, honey!

133
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,405
Bye, Eva!
Thanks for the ride.

134
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,965
You're welcome, Chloe.

135
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,283
Oh, Maddy Price!

136
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,726
You littered, honey.

137
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,450
What did you say?

138
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,963
I said, pick up your trash.
You're not British.

139
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,200
What a bitch.

140
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,323
Come on in.
Thank you.

141
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,085
Nice to see you.
You, too.

142
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,006
You can just put your table
down there if you want.

143
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,051
Would you mind
taking your shoes off?

144
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,571
Not at all.

145
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,605
Thank you.
And your socks, too.

146
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,928
Do you want
some iced tea?

147
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,963
That sounds good.
Thank you.

148
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,242
I'm so happy
you called.

149
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,126
Most people usually just
take my card to be polite.

150
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,085
Well,
I'm not polite.

151
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,322
Oh, my, isn't this nice!

152
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,641
Wow.

153
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,164
Thank you!

154
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,209
Just make yourself
at home, look around.

155
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,806
I'm going to go change.

156
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,129
Everything is so pretty!
Can I live here?

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,480
That tea's kind
of fabulous, too.

158
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,681
I'm dating this guy.
He has no sense of humor.

159
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,041
That can be
a dealbreaker.

160
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,567
I don't know what to
do... he's very sweet.

161
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,484
Sweet can be good.

162
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,563
Maybe you can find someone
else to tell you jokes.

163
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,405
Are you married?

164
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,405
Divorced. Ten years.

165
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,811
Are you still friends?

166
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,730
No, not really.

167
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,084
We share a daughter,
but other than that...

168
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,405
...it's hard to believe that I
ever had a laugh with that man...

169
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,564
...let alone
create a child.

170
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,766
I know what you mean about your ex.
We had zero in common.

171
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,687
I don't know how lever had a
real conversation with him.

172
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,171
It's crazy, right?

173
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,127
I'd like to call you pretty
soon if it's all right.

174
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,607
My right shoulder
is still very tight.

175
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,444
You should
ice it tonight.

176
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,443
And drink
plenty of water.

177
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,726
It's important
to stay hydrated.

178
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,845
Of course. Hey, do you want some chervil?
I'm drowning in it.

179
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,201
Sure.

180
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,124
I'll just give
you what I've cut.

181
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,127
I don't have anything
to put it in, but...

182
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,761
Oh, that's ideal.
Thank you.

183
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,769
Lovely. Thank you.

184
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,770
Thank you so much.

185
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,045
What is chervil? She said
she was drowning in it.

186
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,201
It's a herb.

187
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,805
- A what?
- An herb.

188
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,201
How long have you known me?

189
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,204
I can't understand
a damn thing you say.

190
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,441
Oh, my God.

191
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,486
Everything in that house was gorgeous.
I wanted everything.

192
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,882
She has no cellulite!

193
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,081
How can that be?

194
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,161
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

195
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,401
Nothing.

196
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,723
Will told me some guy you met
at the party wants your number.

197
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,325
<i>Jason's friend, I think.</i>

198
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,963
That's so funny. We both said we
weren't attracted to each other.

199
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,485
I don't know what to do.
He's kind of fat.

200
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,561
He is?

201
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,887
He's got this big belly.

202
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,322
<i>Well, you've got
nothing to lose.</i>

203
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,883
No, but he does.

204
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,083
Your light came on.
You got a patient.

205
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,004
<i>Better get a move on.</i>

206
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,810
What happens if you
never go out there?

207
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,769
Do they...

208
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,845
Was that inappropriate?

209
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,127
Bye.

210
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,320
I'm sorry about this. I swear to
God I made a dinner reservation.

211
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,170
No, it's okay.
It's fine.

212
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,761
What about you?
What do you do?

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,004
I work at the American
Library of Cultural History.

214
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,443
The what? Exactly. It's kind
of a television library.

215
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,569
Do you watch
a lot of TV?

216
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,444
No, it's
television history.

217
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,206
What's on now,
I have no clue.

218
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,889
I tried to watch one of those
<i>Housewives of Idiot Town...</i>

219
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,206
...but I got so depressed, I thought
I was going to jump off a building.

220
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,047
I know what you mean. I tried to
watch one with my daughter...

221
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,726
...and I could not believe
what I was watching!

222
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,807
No brains, and the fake
cheekbones and fake boobs.

223
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,565
Do you like
fake boobs?

224
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,041
No. I like real boobs.

225
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,883
I have real boobs.

226
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,607
That's working out for us then.

227
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,247
How long have
you been divorced?

228
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,925
About four years.

229
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,561
Was it mutual?

230
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,410
Not really. No.

231
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,410
Can I have her number?

232
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,845
Of course.

233
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,923
Imagine the time
that would save.

234
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,605
We should all put
a sign on our necks

235
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,445
with what's wrong with us.
Get it all out there.

236
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,842
Good idea. What
would your sign say?

237
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,244
I don't know. I'm a slob.
I have ear hair.

238
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,762
There are things
to get rid of that.

239
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,445
Researched,
taken care of.

240
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,531
So you're a slob, huh?

241
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,842
Not like a
dirty hoarder slob.

242
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,126
What kind?

243
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,446
A normal disorganized one.

244
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,121
Does your daughter
live with you?

245
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,201
Half the time.

246
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,287
It aggravates her sometimes. She and
her mother are very, very neat.

247
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,967
As a matter of fact,
their favorite store...

248
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,441
...I don't know,
it's... it's the store

249
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,801
with all the empty
boxes and storage.

250
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,371
The Container Store?

251
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,290
Yes. The Container Store.

252
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,645
The store that sells crap you can put
your crap in so you can buy more crap.

253
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,564
I love that store!
I love crap.

254
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,488
So did my ex-wife, and she puts it in
lovely, flowery and expensive boxes.

255
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,328
You should know, they have things
in sort of manly designs there.

256
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,641
Manly designs?

257
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,487
Yeah, like browns,
and little cowboy designs.

258
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,005
Little cowboys.

259
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,164
I mean, come on. It's hard
to live with somebody,

260
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,403
don't you think?
People's habits are...

261
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,006
Okay, listen to this.
I like guacamole.

262
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,642
But I don't like the onions in
guacamole, so I take a chip...

263
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,002
...and swirl it
around and separate

264
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,844
the onions from
the guacamole...

265
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,003
...so I can eat it. Now,
that drove her bananas.

266
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,605
It sounds pretty harmless.

267
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,844
I thought so, but by the end of
our marriage, it made her gag.

268
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,764
That's not nice.

269
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,525
You have...

270
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,931
...lovely hands.

271
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,089
I thought, as a masseuse,
you'd have big,

272
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,362
muscular hands,
but they're very lovely.

273
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,441
Thank you.

274
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,610
You have nice hands, too.

275
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,046
Thank you.

276
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,041
Kind of like paddles.

277
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,887
Did they just turn
the music louder?

278
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,045
No, I think you
just got older.

279
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,204
Excuse me! Do you mind turning
down the music a little?

280
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,611
I'm Old.

281
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,371
No, I'm sorry.

282
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,410
No, you're sorry I'm old or that
you won't turn the music down?

283
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,563
I'm not allowed to
change it, ma'am.

284
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,571
He's so nice!

285
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,882
I find I don't
like younger people.

286
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,201
Eh?

287
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,562
I'm sorry, I picked
the wrong restaurant.

288
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,246
I'm having a great time.
This is delicious.

289
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,927
I can't hear what
you're saying, but...

290
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,322
That's probably why you're
having a great time.

291
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,164
What is this, tomatoes?

292
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,243
Tomatoes?
It's watermelon.

293
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,084
That's croutons
next to it.

294
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,330
Doesn't that
defeat the purpose?

295
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,446
It's nonfat yogurt, not ice cream.
You can put stuff on it.

296
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,521
That looks good, man.

297
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,445
What? What?

298
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,205
People tasting?

299
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,765
Take a chance.
Put something in your bowl.

300
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,684
You're not buying a house.

301
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,121
He's happy.

302
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,371
I know. Give me this.

303
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,887
They have to test the flavors,
there's millions of them.

304
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,600
Very Berry Sorbet, and...

305
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,803
This is my daughter.

306
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,886
Wowie kazowie!
She's stunning! Lucky you.

307
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,122
She looks like her
mother, thank God.

308
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,961
Here's mine.

309
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,646
Right there.

310
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,211
She's beautiful.

311
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,811
You got any money?

312
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,721
I'm kidding.

313
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,961
Oh, my God.

314
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,406
I had such a good time.
That was really fun.

315
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,561
I thought so, too.

316
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,004
I'm not sure.

317
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,241
Okay.

318
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,481
Mean...

319
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,650
...I mean, maybe.

320
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,925
I understand.

321
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,165
It's just... I'm not sure.

322
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,843
I get it.
I'm not deaf.

323
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,120
I'm a little deaf in...

324
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,170
Thank you very much.

325
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,841
I like your paddles.

326
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,125
I like your ass.

327
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,531
My God.

328
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,441
Well, thank you.

329
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,045
Good night.

330
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,041
Hi!

331
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,451
Hi.
Hi.

332
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,927
How was it?

333
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,041
Fine.

334
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,568
I mean, if he hooks up with someone
else, I'll feel like an idiot.

335
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,370
So don't do it.

336
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,361
What are you
talking about?

337
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,567
Nothing.

338
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,203
I can't decide if I should
sleep with Chris or not.

339
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,642
I don't want to do
something I'll regret...

340
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,407
...but I also really like him,
so I don't know what to do.

341
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,562
And you're a virgin?

342
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,484
Yeah.
Don't answer that!

343
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,089
Here's what I say. You can't live
in fear of making a mistake.

344
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,731
If you want to do it, do it.

345
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,924
Mom.
What?

346
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,571
Stay out of it.

347
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,569
Ellen, honey, she asked me.

348
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,081
She did?

349
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,685
Right, Chloe? No?

350
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,761
My bad.

351
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,401
Quiet.

352
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,604
<i>Ellen, I forgot to ask...</i>

353
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,161
...what happened
to Maddy Price?

354
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,601
She was so rude to
me the other day!

355
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,003
She had a threesome with
Sage Berger and Brendon Weiss...

356
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,531
she thinks she's
Taylor Momsen.

357
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,921
Don't tell my mom!

358
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,843
She can tell me stuff.
You never do.

359
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,441
Wait a minute.
They had a threesome?

360
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,523
Forget it, Mom.

361
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,763
What is happening?

362
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,771
Is everybody doing it?

363
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,280
Mom, shut up!

364
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,201
Come out!

365
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,451
You look beautiful!

366
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,965
Look at you two.

367
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,361
Come on!

368
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,122
We're not buying
the same dress, Mom!

369
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,964
We won't wear it
at the same time.

370
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,041
But you look stupid.

371
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,201
I think I look good.

372
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,407
You're so lumpy!

373
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,086
I'd wear that if I could.

374
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,406
Thank you.

375
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,566
No, you wouldn't.
Mom, you look crazy.

376
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,962
You are not the only attractive
girl in this family, Chloe.

377
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,164
Why can't you dress like Ellen's mom?
She looks normal.

378
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,164
So what happened
with not-so-funny guy?

379
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,846
It didn't work out.

380
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,570
Oh.
No, it's fine.

381
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,170
What about you?

382
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,330
Do you have
a boyfriend?

383
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,527
I had a very good first
date over the weekend.

384
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,604
Oh, how nice!
What's he like?

385
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,001
Funny.

386
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,681
We really never
stopped talking.

387
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,846
It was like we were
old friends already.

388
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,129
Be careful with that, 'cause
it could kill the chemistry.

389
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,044
No, no.
In a good way.

390
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,682
Really. I mean, it was just...
it was very flirtatious.

391
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,327
I didn't find him
attractive at first,

392
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,807
because he's not handsome
in the typical way.

393
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,805
But, um...

394
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,204
...I don't know... now I
find him kind of... sexy.

395
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,085
Hi.

396
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,731
Did I get
the day wrong?

397
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,490
No. Why?

398
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,844
Because you're
wearing pajamas?

399
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,402
It's just brunch. It's Sunday.
I like to be comfortable.

400
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,683
Oh, good. Okay.
Come on in.

401
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,244
I got us that.

402
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,411
I'll make us
some mimosas.

403
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,762
This is nice.
Thank you.

404
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,090
You carry a purse?

405
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,843
No, that's my
daughter Tess's.

406
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,765
It was outrageously expensive, but
it was her 18th birthday, so...

407
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,601
Oh, my God! Bagels!

408
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,601
I love bread.
I really love it.

409
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,284
So, what's she like?
Your daughter.

410
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,127
She's very sophisticated... as
you can tell by the pocketbook.

411
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,691
"Pocketbook".

412
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,126
She's smart, lovely and funny,
and she's moving to New York.

413
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,051
Very far away.

414
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,725
It is far.

415
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,370
She's going to Parsons
School of Design. Oh!

416
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,961
I'm very proud of her.

417
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,286
I bet. I would be.

418
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,927
But part of me thinks
that I shouldn't let her go.

419
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,930
She's 18 and this is
a great opportunity...

420
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,890
...but if something
happens to her...

421
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,806
...while she's in New York,
I will never forgive myself.

422
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,803
Come on. But I know
what you mean.

423
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,882
This going away
to college thing.

424
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,085
We just send them off? And not
know where they are all the time?

425
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,162
Aside from the fact
that I don't know

426
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,322
what my life will be
like when she's gone.

427
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,569
And Ellen doesn't
want her dad and me

428
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,484
to take her there.
We take her...

429
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,081
...to the airport here,
but don't fly with her.

430
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,810
That would kill me...
just put her on the plane?

431
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,644
Heartbreaking.

432
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,402
We're going to have
to develop hobbies.

433
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,011
I guess so.

434
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,527
I already have one,
'cause I knit.

435
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,162
So I'll just spend the rest of my
life knitting. That's my plan.

436
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,761
That's funny because...
actually, I weave.

437
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,001
Like baskets?

438
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,203
Yeah, I do it in the garage.
Really!

439
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,441
No.

440
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,043
Why would you
think I'd weave?

441
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,204
I thought you were...
I didn't want to insult you.

442
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,285
I'm kind of glad you don't weave.
Me, too.

443
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,045
I've been picturing what it's going
to be like for her not to be here.

444
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,602
Even though she's only here half
the time, it'll be very different.

445
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,171
I can see your penis.

446
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,805
My God!

447
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,206
Your pajama thing
is a little bit open.

448
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,805
Shit! I'm very sorry.

449
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,721
What did you think?

450
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,323
I think
you are very healthy.

451
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,561
Thank you.

452
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,881
Go change your pants.

453
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,961
Be right back.

454
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,882
What happened to you guys? Not
the details, just general...

455
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,891
We were... very different.

456
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,245
We never had sex.
Not my choice.

457
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,483
She just had no
interest in it.

458
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,563
And I'm pretty sure
she had an affair.

459
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,126
Which was awful,

460
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,009
because it meant
that she did like sex,

461
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,924
she just didn't
like it with me.

462
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,161
You. Right.

463
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,243
She thought
my job was stupid.

464
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,926
She thought I parented badly.
I thought she parented badly.

465
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,844
Why are you
wrecking my backyard?

466
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,171
You have
a lot of weeds.

467
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,251
I thought this was all good.

468
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,526
No.

469
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,083
We never had sex, either.
Not his choice.

470
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,284
We were pretty out of
sync in that department.

471
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,446
We were pretty out of sync
with Ellen, too. Oh, my God...

472
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,771
...fought all the time
about how to parent.

473
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,204
That's good grass
you're pulling up.

474
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,283
I'll put it back.

475
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,881
Jesus.

476
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,284
Got yourself a...

477
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,724
...blister thing going on?

478
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,806
Yeah.

479
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,961
Are you grossed out?

480
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,607
No.

481
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,721
You are. Are you
freaked out by my feet?

482
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,282
I have a little
problem with feet.

483
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,211
Have you looked
at your own feet?

484
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,686
I'm used to my feet.

485
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,961
Okay, well...

486
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,651
What's the deal?

487
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,042
It has to do with my mother.

488
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,521
She had feet?

489
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,405
She had spectacular feet.

490
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,641
Here we go.

491
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,201
They were red and
yellow and green

492
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,561
and purple and
swollen with veins.

493
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,721
I get it.

494
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,921
Don't do that.

495
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,481
I have to. I've never
had a pedicure.

496
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,001
I never saw the point
until this actual moment.

497
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,890
Would you like a Band-Aid?

498
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,570
Please!
That would be great.

499
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,082
And maybe a
bag for my foot.

500
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,167
Stop it.

501
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,084
Two bags. Two bags
for the old bag.

502
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,322
I knew I shouldn't
have told you.

503
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,321
They're naked, right?

504
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,441
Yeah.

505
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,171
Are you ever
attracted to them?

506
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,685
No.

507
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,002
I'm sure they're
attracted to you.

508
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,524
They're getting
massaged.

509
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,684
Do they ever hit on you?

510
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,524
Sometimes, yeah.

511
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,364
I can give you a massage
some time, if you want.

512
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,884
I might like that.

513
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,883
I would definitely
hit on you.

514
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,530
That might be okay.

515
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,361
Really?

516
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,891
Want a kiss?

517
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,721
Yeah.

518
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,004
You didn't actually open your
eyes at any point, did you?

519
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,607
No. No worries.

520
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,682
I kept my eyes closed.

521
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,091
I figured...

522
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,286
...if I couldn't see you,
you couldn't see me.

523
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,762
Oh, I saw you.

524
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,770
Oh, God.

525
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,122
I'm tired of
being funny.

526
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,371
Me, too.

527
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,043
But you're not funny.

528
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,647
I'm so excited for you.
He sounds great.

529
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,565
He is great. It was so cute...
he made a whole bruncheon.

530
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,121
Sweet.
Yeah, it was sweet.

531
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,325
Okay, good.

532
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,810
We had such good sex.

533
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,169
How fun.
I can't even imagine.

534
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,561
What do you think?

535
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,166
I liked how it was before. You're
going to give yourself a hernia.

536
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,210
Okay, you guys are done.
Thanks for your help.

537
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,930
Take your drawing
in the kitchen.

538
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,162
You can watch TV,
but no <i>Cleveland Show.</i>

539
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,481
Please, Mom?

540
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,686
Okay.

541
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,686
Jeez. Way to
put your foot down.

542
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,604
I'm too tired to
be a good parent.

543
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,842
Maybe because you're
always moving furniture.

544
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,002
Hi, Cathy!
<i>Hola.</i>

545
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,844
You have no idea. Will
refused to fire her...

546
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,526
...so I let it go, hoping she'd
get better. But she got worse.

547
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,684
It was like she wanted to be fired.
She did such dumb stuff.

548
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,604
That is so interesting.

549
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,686
So I fired her. And she started crying.
Then I started crying.

550
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,522
Then we were hugging and...
I hired her back.

551
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,530
Of course you did.
You're nice.

552
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,850
Right? Some people would see
me as being compassionate

553
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,365
or soft-hearted.

554
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,886
Will thinks I'm a baby.

555
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,281
He wants me to fire her again
as a learning experience!

556
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,441
Jesus Christ!

557
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,681
That's our relationship.

558
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,882
Not your whole relationship.
Whatever.

559
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,566
He's a middle child who never got
enough fried chicken at dinner

560
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,085
and needs everything
to be fair.

561
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,243
Miss Sarah? Where should I put this?
It was in the bathroom.

562
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,482
Outside, with the
ping pong table.

563
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,960
Okay. No problem.

564
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,121
Jesus.

565
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,041
<i>Wow.</i>

566
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,722
I've never actually
seen wisdom teeth.

567
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,803
You do have
a lot of fillings.

568
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,605
Are they the
mercury kind?

569
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,727
The normal kind.

570
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,484
And a couple of crowns.

571
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,844
Yeah. Okay, your turn.

572
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,923
Well, I'd rather
you didn't.

573
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,561
Well, I'd rather I did.

574
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,922
I'm going to
get my glasses.

575
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,244
Come on.
Open your mouth! No.

576
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,443
Open your mouth.
Make me.

577
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,160
Make me.

578
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,763
Open your mouth.
Okay.

579
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,564
Oh, my God!
You're missing a tooth?

580
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,930
You are!
Yes, I am.

581
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,201
Let me see.

582
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,284
You can't tell... it's way back there.
It doesn't matter.

583
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,681
I need some kind of
hideous bone graft.

584
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,127
It costs a lot of money
and I'm putting it off.

585
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,203
My grandma
Dee Dee had that.

586
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,603
Your grandma Dee Dee.
Thank you for that. Thanks.

587
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,445
Oh, I'm so sorry!

588
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,286
It's okay. This is Ellen's best friend,
Chloe. This is my friend, Albert.

589
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,801
Hi.

590
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,884
Ellen didn't answer my texts.
I thought she was sleeping.

591
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,646
She's at her dad's, honey.
Is everything okay?

592
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,405
I thought we were
getting breakfast.

593
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,891
You hungry?

594
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,329
Let's see.
From 1975, Channel 4.

595
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,801
Well, what time?

596
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,160
Oh, come on.

597
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,961
Saturday morning.

598
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,646
<i>Woody Woodpecker, Pink Panther,
McDuff, the Talking Dog...</i>

599
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,241
...which I didn't
like but watched anyway,

600
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,761
<i>Monster Squad,
Land of the Lost,</i> then...

601
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,163
<i>...Big John, Little John, which was
like the movie Big,</i> but weirder.

602
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,765
That's incredible.

603
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,444
I thought I watched
a lot of TV!

604
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,841
I looked forward
to that lineup.

605
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,401
What, were you
neglected as a kid?

606
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,330
I was kind of
raised like a veal.

607
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,846
I was put in
a dark room...

608
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,162
...fed and told
not to move.

609
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,684
Very relaxing.

610
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,282
...and she's like, "I
might want to get another size",

611
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,528
but that's bullshit,
it is the right size.

612
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,445
She's petite, but very heavy
on top, so I got a medium!

613
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,967
But here's the thing,
I got it at Nordstrom Rack,

614
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,361
but I put it in
a Neiman Marcus box...

615
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,722
Oh, yeah, that's good.

616
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,044
Don't open the door.

617
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,884
Just pretend you
don't know I'm here...

618
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,042
...even though you
heard me lock my car.

619
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,246
Wow!

620
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,564
Amazing.

621
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,723
So what do you
do with all this?

622
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,562
Do you really want to hear this?
Yeah. I do. What?

623
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,849
I make sure things are
transferred to digital properly.

624
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,084
I make sure they're logged in properly.
I write blurbs...

625
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,484
...so if anyone under 50 wants to
put down their phone and come in...

626
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,048
...and watch something original
and brilliant, they can find it.

627
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,481
Like what, for instance?

628
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,371
<i>The Sid Caesar show.
The Jack Benny show.</i>

629
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,006
<i>The Dean Martin show.</i>

630
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,202
So cool.
Yeah, it is.

631
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,890
I kind of love it.

632
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,891
On slow days...

633
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,370
...I can sit in my office and watch
episodes of <i>What's Happening!!</i>

634
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,561
No, you don't.

635
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,524
Well, if things...

636
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,730
This is my office.

637
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,243
That's Bob. Hey.

638
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,209
Did you ever see <i>Flipper?
</i> Of course I did.

639
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,284
Oh, God. It made me want a
dolphin as a pet so bad.

640
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,164
Really? That's
a lot of work.

641
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,290
What is that noise?

642
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,962
Somebody watching something.
It happens occasionally.

643
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,125
It's Taxi. The episode
where Alex's dog dies.

644
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,167
Buddy or Buster
or something.

645
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,971
You hungry?
Starving.

646
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,201
Let's get lunch.

647
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,481
There she is!
Right on time.

648
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,403
Hi, honey.
Hi, Dad.

649
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,401
So, Eva...

650
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,483
Tess. Tess, Eva.

651
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,561
Hi. Nice to meet you.

652
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,761
You, too.

653
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,171
Seriously?

654
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,206
They have great chili!

655
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,526
I love Chili.

656
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,921
Have you ever
been to Lilly's?

657
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,161
No.

658
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,527
It's so good.
It's around the corner.

659
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,091
Lilly's it is.

660
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,842
I'll be studying
fashion design.

661
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,650
You obviously
have good taste.

662
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,767
Thank you.

663
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,287
Eva has a daughter your age going
to college in the fall also.

664
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,524
She's going to
Sarah Lawrence.

665
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,365
She's interested in English and history.
She loves history!

666
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,364
I think she wants
to be a writer.

667
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,967
Sarah Lawrence is
not what it used to be.

668
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,211
I mean, I'm sure
it's still good.

669
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,206
It's just gone downhill a lot in the
last few years. Some of my, um...

670
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,127
...let's just say not-so-smart
friends just got in. I was shocked.

671
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,202
I'm sure a lot of smart people
still go there. Oh, yeah.

672
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,481
I know. I'm just saying.

673
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,405
I think you should stay
home and go to school here.

674
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,483
At least you're
honest about it.

675
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,328
Mom acts like she's excited to be on
her own again, but I don't buy it.

676
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,883
Why don't we take it a little easy on Mom.
She's all right.

677
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,925
Don't judge till you
have kids of your own.

678
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,924
Except I'm not having any.

679
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,324
And why do you say that?

680
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,410
I want a career.

681
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,570
Anyway, I hate kids.

682
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,761
Really?

683
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,527
Right now we
have that in common.

684
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,761
Corey?

685
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,764
Listen, she doesn't know
what she's talking about.

686
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,161
She's too young to
know what she wants.

687
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,760
Dad, I'm going to go
get a coffee, okay?

688
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,287
Bye. Thank you
for lunch.

689
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,523
So nice to meet you.
You, too.

690
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,647
Yeah. Great.

691
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,841
Bye!
Bye.

692
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,285
Be careful!

693
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,761
She has a lot of friends.

694
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,204
You think she
has threesomes?

695
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,125
What? Why would
you say that?

696
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,409
I know, but apparently, it's
what they're doing these days.

697
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,811
That's what I heard.

698
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,721
Oh, my God.

699
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,801
Right?

700
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,802
I'm afraid that
window's closed.

701
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,290
There was a window?

702
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,322
How was the daughter?

703
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,651
Kind of awful, actually.
A real snob.

704
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,650
That's too bad.

705
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,483
I wonder what your
roommate will be like?

706
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,489
Me, too.

707
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,924
You want me to
call her parents?

708
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,684
No, I don't.

709
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,684
You hungry, honey?

710
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,843
Not really.

711
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,682
What did you eat yesterday?

712
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,011
I don't know.

713
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,162
Well, think. Tell me.
I want to know what you ate.

714
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,531
Cereal...

715
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,203
...a banana...

716
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,366
Where'd you get the banana?
Mom, you're crazy!

717
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,681
What?

718
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,690
What'd you have for lunch?

719
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,041
Okay, bye.

720
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,044
Where are you going?

721
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,166
I mean, he's kind of flabby and
middle-aged, but I don't care.

722
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,567
I'm flabby and
middle-aged.

723
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,406
It's funny, because our
middle-agedness is...

724
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,121
...comforting, and sexy to me.

725
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,404
Isn't that so incredibly sad?
But sort of good too.

726
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,408
Yeah. I think that my ex, all he
wanted was for me to accept...

727
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,247
...his belly and
all his quirks.

728
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,929
In the end, I was completely
repulsed by him sexually.

729
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,485
Kind of terrible in bed
and just very clumsy.

730
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,561
Oh, no.

731
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,091
Just a sec.

732
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,366
Here. It's my last copy, but I
really want you to have it.

733
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,808
Wow! Are you sure?

734
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,211
Absolutely.
Oh, wow.

735
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,404
I'm a little intimidated. I'm
not really good with poetry.

736
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,843
Just let it wash over you.
Don't try to understand it.

737
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,601
I won't, believe me.
God, thank you so much!

738
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,371
I've loved our time together.
I know.

739
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,769
Do you think it would be weird
if we hung out as friends?

740
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,366
I would love that!
I would!

741
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,605
I want you to try this salsa,
'cause these tomatoes are amazing.

742
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,121
But careful! There's
a ton of onions.

743
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,283
One of the many
upsides to my divorce.

744
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,127
What do you mean? My ex hated
onions, so he would take a chip...

745
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,725
...and he would put it in the
salsa and tap, tap, tap...

746
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,611
...swirl, tap, tap, tap,
swirl, and so on,

747
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,409
until all the onions
were pushed...

748
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,403
...up against the side!

749
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,723
It kind of made me sick.

750
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,561
Mom?

751
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,883
That's my daughter... she's not
feeling well. Be right back.

752
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,405
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

753
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,364
I don't feel good.

754
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,682
I feel... Right here.
Let me see.

755
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,201
They're swollen.

756
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,525
Listen, will you come meet my friend?
Just for a second, please?

757
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,927
Eva?

758
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,521
Eva?

759
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,886
That's so weird, she was just here.
Eva?

760
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,923
I'm going back to bed.

761
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,204
I love you. I love you, too.
You have bad breath.

762
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,044
I'm sick!

763
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,725
God!

764
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,771
Hi.

765
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,647
This planting I'm
admiring, it's so huge!

766
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,721
Thank you.

767
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,884
I wanted you to meet my
daughter Tess, but...

768
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,571
I have to go.

769
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,881
Okay!

770
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,411
Yeah. Okay.

771
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,926
Great!

772
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,606
All right.

773
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,810
So I'll call you and
we'll do something.

774
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,605
Wonderful.
Thank you so much!

775
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,922
It was so nice!

776
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,447
Thank you so much.

777
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,846
Have a great day.

778
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,922
Great, great, great!

779
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,241
Bye-bye.

780
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,685
Are you Okay?
I got it!

781
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,441
Do you believe that?
I am not shitting you!

782
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,446
That is an unbelievable coincidence.
What will you do?

783
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,681
I don't know!

784
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,681
Oh, shit! Your light went on.
Can you call me back, please?

785
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,927
Hi, Mom!

786
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,001
Hi! Did you take
your shoes off?

787
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,044
No. Since when
do I have to?

788
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,648
We're doing that now. It's cleaner.
And your socks, too.

789
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,803
You are not going
to believe this.

790
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,646
It turns out that the woman I've
been massaging is Albert's ex-wife.

791
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,725
Weird!
So weird.

792
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,646
I have been listening to her say the
worst things about the one guy...

793
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,484
...I started to really,
really like.

794
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,327
And I pictured the ex she was
talking about as this fat...

795
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,324
...irritating slob...

796
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,642
...and it turns
out it's Albert!

797
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,161
Fat Albert!

798
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,925
What? Who?

799
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,242
It's a cartoon.
A cartoon!

800
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,490
But he's so not like that.

801
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,761
How do you know?

802
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,480
We had breakfast the other day.
He's sweet, funny.

803
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,569
Yeah, you liked
him, right?

804
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,490
Totally.
Wait, what?

805
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,002
You weren't here.
We all had breakfast.

806
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,045
I haven't even met him.

807
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,611
Well, you will.

808
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,842
What did she say about him?
Oh, my God!

809
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,005
It's like this parade of horribles!
He's disgusting.

810
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,084
That he's like
this clown in bed.

811
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,770
Mom! Oh, my God!

812
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,285
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

813
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,887
I date sometimes. It's just
so hard to meet people.

814
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,247
And I'm not
attracted to anybody.

815
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,244
Really?
Really.

816
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,551
And you weren't attracted
to your ex-husband?

817
00:41:31,577 --> 00:41:33,591
That must have been difficult.

818
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,084
Well, I tried
really hard. I did.

819
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,600
But he would go on so many diets,
and then he would cheat...

820
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,242
...and then he would act
shocked when he got fatter.

821
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,445
...the behavior
around the weight.

822
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,641
Excuse me.

823
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,447
Are you Marianne Hope?

824
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,641
Yes.

825
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,091
Oh, my God!
I told you.

826
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,482
You are like
our biggest idol.

827
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,285
This means
so much to us.

828
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,767
She gave me a copy of Beautiful
<i>Fruit</i> when my mom died.

829
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,445
It saved me.

830
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,325
How wonderful.
I'm so sorry.

831
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,601
Oh, thank you.

832
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,610
Well, thanks very much.
Blessings.

833
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,841
Blessings.

834
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,121
Take care.
Blessings!

835
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,442
It's so cool
that you saved her.

836
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,645
But, he never
got obese, right?

837
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,806
Well, it depends on your
definition of the word obese.

838
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,122
But initially,
um... you were...

839
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,851
...I don't know, you
liked him, more or less?

840
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,323
Unfortunately... less.

841
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,322
There were just so many things
that really got on my nerves.

842
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,851
Like what, though?

843
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,162
Sorry I'm being so negative.
I really am.

844
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,044
It's okay. It is.

845
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,482
It's just that I don't
really have anybody

846
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,847
I can bitch to
about things like this.

847
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,323
You can completely
bitch to me. Really.

848
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,489
Thank you.
Oh, sure.

849
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,171
I trust you.

850
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,725
Oh, good.

851
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,565
I do.

852
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,525
What's wrong with you?
She can find another masseuse.

853
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,451
I'm her friend. She doesn't
have any close friends.

854
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,931
I'm like it.

855
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,005
I feel so pulled in.
She's like a human Trip Advisor.

856
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,730
Albert is not a hotel.

857
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,731
But if you could avoid staying
in a bad one, wouldn't you?

858
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,241
Oh, my God.

859
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,246
She has said so many
bad things about him.

860
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,681
She's not perfect.

861
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,366
But she knows what she's talking about.
She's smart.

862
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,881
So are you.

863
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,923
Maybe she's ultimately right.

864
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,364
Are you right about Peter? You didn't
want him... does that make him unlovable?

865
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,044
By anyone normal.

866
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,883
You haven't said anything about
my furniture arrangement.

867
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,242
I don't remember
how it was before.

868
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,405
Hey! What do you think?

869
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,200
Oh, honey. Why do you
keep doing this?

870
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,885
She's filling a hole.

871
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,201
I'll fill your hole.

872
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,931
Different hole.

873
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,051
You're missing out.
Fun time!

874
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,606
Hi!

875
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,085
Whose car is this?

876
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,404
Tess is getting hers fixed.
This is a rental.

877
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,561
Sorry.

878
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,921
Why do you have it?

879
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,480
I'm letting her drive mine.
She likes it better.

880
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,811
Yeah, I bet she does.

881
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,570
You okay?
Yeah.

882
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,761
What was that?

883
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,769
The gear skrinkle.

884
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,445
"Skrinkle?"

885
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,765
Why are you
shaking that?

886
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,923
It spreads the
butter around.

887
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,284
You put more
butter on that?

888
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,966
No, I put regular butter. I asked
for butter. I didn't put more butter.

889
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,003
Oh, I thought it
came with butter.

890
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,726
This actor, I saw him
in a restaurant.

891
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,286
He was about three
and a half feet tall.

892
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,483
You need to
whisper, okay?

893
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,721
What is she wearing?
It looks like her aunt

894
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,127
crocheted something
to put over a plant.

895
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,401
Shh!

896
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,801
You got to whisper.

897
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,160
I am whispering.

898
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,325
I'm whispering.
No.

899
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,161
<i>I want to
ask you something.</i>

900
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,801
And I really
want the truth.

901
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,641
Okay?

902
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,484
Can you breathe
when I'm on top of you?

903
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,367
Yeah!

904
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,367
I'm planning on losing some weight.
I know I need to.

905
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,171
Was it an issue with your ex-wife?
Oh, my God!

906
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,448
Sometimes I ate
just to drive her nuts.

907
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,891
You have a cold?

908
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,364
No. No, I...

909
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,366
I broke my nose
a couple times.

910
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,520
My doctor says at this point,
my nose is purely ornamental.

911
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,921
Will you get it fixed?

912
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,565
Yeah, after the missing tooth.

913
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,886
You know, I think
Tess really liked you.

914
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,725
I could tell.

915
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,404
She seems so neat.

916
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,882
She really is a great girl.

917
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,051
I know she can be obnoxious
sometimes, but...

918
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,604
...she's young. She's really got
a good heart. She'll figure it out.

919
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,282
I kind of adore you already.

920
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,444
So what about you and Chris?
What's going on?

921
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,924
What? What?

922
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,761
We did it.

923
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,921
Really?

924
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,091
How was it?

925
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,322
Nice. I think.

926
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,081
No, it was good.

927
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,368
Congratulations.
I'm happy it was nice.

928
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,807
Even if we don't stay together,
I'm glad I got it over with.

929
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,410
I'm glad I took your advice.

930
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,285
Hey! Hi, honey.

931
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,481
When did you get here?

932
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,130
A couple of minutes ago.
Just waiting for you.

933
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,806
Look.

934
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,611
I've wanted to paint your
nails for like ten years.

935
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,200
I thought you
were too ticklish.

936
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,606
I know!

937
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,121
She's in love.

938
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,642
So I guess that
makes you not ticklish.

939
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,649
You weren't here.
Come be with us.

940
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,683
Actually, I have some...

941
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,643
Come on, Ellen.
Come back.

942
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,010
Crazy day.

943
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,802
I had a wonderful call from
Joni Mitchell this morning.

944
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,688
She read the galleys to my new collection
and loved them, so that was...

945
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,842
You're friends
with Joni Mitchell?

946
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,644
Yeah, we have been for a while.
Do you want some water?

947
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,201
No, thank you.

948
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,840
And I met a guy!
A really nice guy.

949
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,361
He takes really good care
of himself. He's vegan...

950
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,883
...and he actually read
my work before he met me.

951
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,323
A poetry-reading vegan.
Oh, my God!

952
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,330
I hope it goes well.

953
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,921
I tend to get my hopes
up a little early.

954
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,327
I just don't want to
be disappointed again.

955
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,684
With Albert, there was
always this bait and switch.

956
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,446
When we first started
dating, I thought,

957
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,006
"Oh, he's mature.
He can buy a house."

958
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,569
This house?
Yes!

959
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,089
But you should see where he lives now.
And he made...

960
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:05,366
...this dish of spaghetti
with eggplant and mozzarella.

961
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,364
Sounds kind of delicious.

962
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,927
But it turned out that
was all he could cook.

963
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,927
And he has no friends.
I mean, neither do I, but...

964
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,405
Well, me and Joni.

965
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,564
Yeah. That's true!
That's true, that's true.

966
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,041
Hi.

967
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,243
Hungry?
Yes.

968
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:40,089
Get ready for some
eggplant with mozzarella!

969
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,765
You okay?
Yeah.

970
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,926
Wow! This is
actually delicious!

971
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,924
Why do you
sound surprised?

972
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,805
It's great.

973
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,801
How was work today?

974
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,120
Good.

975
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,881
I had two massages.

976
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,081
Barnacles?

977
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,085
Non-stop talking?
Boners?

978
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,444
There was this nice woman
in Santa Monica.

979
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,763
She talked a lot
about her ex-husband.

980
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,440
I just hope it
wasn't my ex-wife.

981
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,846
I

982
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,610
I got you a little present.

983
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,131
You did?

984
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,362
Now, it's just
a little present.

985
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,121
Oh, my God!

986
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,811
I saw it and
thought of you.

987
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,647
This beautiful,
wonderful...

988
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,327
I can't do it,
but let me help you.

989
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,971
Oh, my God.

990
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,163
Thank you so much.

991
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,481
Look.

992
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,127
Do you like it on me?

993
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,201
It's nice.

994
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,924
Maybe I shouldn't have?
Is it too soon?

995
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,606
No. It's just so nice.

996
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,841
Thank you.

997
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,081
Oh!

998
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,685
What?
Nothing.

999
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,447
You all right? Yeah. I don't
know what that was. Sorry.

1000
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,683
Let me get here.
You okay?

1001
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,526
Stop! Stop!
Your beard is so tickly.

1002
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,487
Sorry.

1003
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,561
That's okay.

1004
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,201
Okay, here I come again.
Oh, goodie.

1005
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,361
Oh, my hair!
My hair, my hair!

1006
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,123
I don't know what I'm doing, but this
isn't going very well, so let's just stop.

1007
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,601
What?

1008
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,931
You look cute
in my robe.

1009
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,527
Is everything okay? You have
like four hundred mouthwashes.

1010
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,764
Yeah, I need to
use them and...

1011
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:19,967
...then I buy them and then I forget
about them and then I buy more of them.

1012
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,522
And you have like 80
million toothbrushes.

1013
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,801
I do?

1014
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,211
I only use one of them.

1015
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,886
So why don't you throw
the other ones out?

1016
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,809
I don't know. Because...
they're my friends?

1017
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,485
Are you all right?

1018
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,164
You want to take
another shot at it?

1019
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,006
I'm just...
I'm kind of tired.

1020
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,002
Is that okay?
It's okay.

1021
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,322
You looked
so pretty.

1022
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,922
Seriously, kiddo,
I'm proud of you.

1023
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,241
Thank you, Dad.

1024
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,646
We are so proud.

1025
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,371
We have some graduation
money for you.

1026
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,010
Thank you, Fran, Dad.

1027
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,770
It's in fives.

1028
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,205
Thank you for
including me.

1029
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,124
You really have
a fight with your mom?

1030
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,203
Huge.
Where's your dad?

1031
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,046
He lives in San Diego, but
you'd think he was in Alaska.

1032
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,208
He never visits.

1033
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,124
But I don't care.

1034
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,728
He remarried this really weird
woman, and she never talks.

1035
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,803
Hear, hear for
second marriages!

1036
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,246
It's kind Of true.

1037
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,005
It's good when everyone
is older and wiser.

1038
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,081
Steady.

1039
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,567
And people have figured
out how to compromise.

1040
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,801
Or behave.

1041
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,122
Thank you very much.
Nobody's talking about you.

1042
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,880
Don't take it personally.
I'm talking generally.

1043
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:09,330
If I got married again, I'd be on the
lookout for the inevitable problems.

1044
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,164
Odd conversation.
Pretty weird.

1045
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,880
Sorry, but maybe don't get
married a second time.

1046
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,003
I'm not saying I will.
I'm just saying.

1047
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,401
She's just saying.

1048
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,561
Fran, what was
your ex-husband like?

1049
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,323
Oh, he was actually a lovely, lovely man.
But not for me.

1050
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,765
Very grownup!

1051
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,560
He passed away.
Two years ago.

1052
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,841
Oh, I'm sorry.

1053
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,161
Could we get some
more bread, please?

1054
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,164
Please, no more bread.
Why not?

1055
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,765
I don't want to eat it.
Then don't.

1056
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,081
More bread, please.

1057
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,081
Are you going to eat it?

1058
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,920
I don't know,
but somebody else might.

1059
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,525
I probably will.
Me, too.

1060
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,171
Bread eater, bread eater.

1061
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,760
I'm sorry. So, Fran,
you eat bread, I see.

1062
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,365
It's true!

1063
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,001
So you get to keep
cookies in the house.

1064
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,361
I can.

1065
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,931
What are you
talking about?

1066
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,522
It's not a big deal, but I have
trouble controlling myself...

1067
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,286
...so when Peter would
bring home things like...

1068
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,523
...chocolate or good
bread, yummy stuff,

1069
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,608
I'd eat all of it,
then hate myself.

1070
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,530
And me for
bringing it home.

1071
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,045
So did you
stop buying it?

1072
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,203
Yeah, I did.
And got so angry.

1073
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,283
I was not angry.
A little bit angry.

1074
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,691
Well, he should
have been angry.

1075
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,366
Why should he be deprived because
she can't control herself?

1076
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,405
Because she's his wife and
he's trying to help her?

1077
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,724
Yeah, but is that
really helping her?

1078
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,006
Yes!

1079
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,082
Not if we want her to
learn to control herself.

1080
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,321
"We?"

1081
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,562
I just said it's
not fair to him.

1082
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,644
Why does everything have to be fair?
What are you, six?

1083
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,167
Of course... What?
Let's keep it nice.

1084
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,880
I just forget the
cookies are there. So...

1085
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,484
That's why it's good you're
married to Peter and I'm not.

1086
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,167
That is absolutely
the God's honest truth.

1087
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,804
Ooh, it's cold out.

1088
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,049
Nobody ate the bread,
by the way.

1089
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,087
You did.

1090
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,525
Yeah, exactly.

1091
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,685
Exactly?

1092
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,170
Let me ask
you a question.

1093
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,169
When people ask why we got
divorced, what do you say?

1094
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,165
I say I don't think you and I
should have been together.

1095
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,843
What about Fran? Did you
talk to her about us?

1096
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,206
Right. She's
your wife. Right.

1097
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,045
Yeah, okay.

1098
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,690
That was fun, huh?

1099
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,251
I started this blanket
when you were five.

1100
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,568
I don't know what I was
thinking about this color.

1101
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,041
I'm going to finish it,
so you can take it with you.

1102
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,720
I'll probably buy
another one, in case.

1103
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,446
What are you talking about?
This will be good.

1104
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,447
Why are you
looking at this?

1105
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,285
I don't know.

1106
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,284
I just pulled it out.

1107
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,602
I was trying to
remember what I knew.

1108
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,240
Did I already know those
things about your dad?

1109
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,806
I mean the things
we would fight about.

1110
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,967
Probably not.

1111
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,084
I think I did, actually.

1112
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,645
I think I always knew.

1113
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,803
Or felt them.

1114
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,809
I just wasn't
paying attention.

1115
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,802
But look at
what I got, huh?

1116
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,328
I'm going to bed. No, stay
here and cozy up with me.

1117
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,284
I'm tired.

1118
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,161
Come on, Chloe.

1119
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,124
Is that hard?

1120
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,845
Not at all.
You want to learn?

1121
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,331
Yeah.

1122
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,643
I've been trying to teach
Ellen for the longest time!

1123
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,161
Albert.

1124
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,485
Are you still
seeing his wife?

1125
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,327
Well, she has a bad shoulder.
And she has no friends.

1126
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,322
What? Don't look
at me like that.

1127
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,650
I'm screwed up.

1128
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,687
Just one second.

1129
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,962
I'm in the middle
of some bullshit.

1130
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,128
Can you just put
your table down?

1131
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,010
I'll be right back.

1132
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,522
Yeah. Take your time.

1133
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,521
We did, we agreed
on it, Albert!

1134
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,047
Because I was there!
I remember.

1135
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,402
Oh, my God. Okay. Well, it is.
It's all worked out.

1136
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,769
Yes, it is.
Okay, fine, good. Bye!

1137
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,926
My God, I cannot wait till I don't
have to talk to him anymore.

1138
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,321
What happened?

1139
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,001
He thinks he should take
Tess to school, not me.

1140
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,401
Tess wants it to be me,
because she told me.

1141
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,002
But, I mean... Thank you. Can't
you both just take her?

1142
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,766
I don't think so.
No, I don't.

1143
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,481
He's such a wreck
about her going away.

1144
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,921
She doesn't need that
kind of energy right now.

1145
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,445
And he just focuses so much onto her.
She can feel it.

1146
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,842
Isn't that kind
of nice, though?

1147
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,761
I mean,
that he focuses?

1148
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,128
Well, maybe if he had a girlfriend or
something so it would balance it out...

1149
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,203
...but I don't see that happening.

1150
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,805
Really? Why not?

1151
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,371
Because he's a loser.

1152
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,841
Uh-oh.

1153
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,803
Such a mean word,
but it fits.

1154
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,121
How does it fit?

1155
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,124
For instance... this
is typically Albert...

1156
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,283
...when we were
first going out,

1157
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,408
he had nothing
next to his bed.

1158
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,404
No table, nothing.

1159
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,847
At first I thought,
"That's cute.

1160
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,122
It's kind of bohemian."
Stuff like that.

1161
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,801
So then we got
married and I went out

1162
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,400
and bought these really
lovely bedside tables.

1163
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,450
Then last year,
I saw all of his stuff

1164
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,010
was on the side
of the bed again.

1165
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,208
I mean, I took
the tables, granted,

1166
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,482
but he never went
out and replaced them.

1167
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,566
He's just content to just put
his shit on the floor again.

1168
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,845
Metaphorically speaking, he's not
building a life for himself.

1169
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,490
I mean, who would date
a person like that?

1170
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:07,887
Right.

1171
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,606
I'm not picking up.

1172
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,527
<i>Marianne,
please pick up the phone.</i>

1173
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,050
<i>We haven't resolved anything.
I know you're there.</i>

1174
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,122
This is so embarrassing.
I'm sorry.

1175
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,446
<i>Fine.
Don't deal with it.</i>

1176
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,366
Okay, these are
just little things.

1177
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,842
Ultimately, we just...

1178
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,841
I never felt
understood by him.

1179
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,441
You know?

1180
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,042
He didn't get the poetry.

1181
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,964
He never got me.

1182
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,045
Has anyone ever
gotten you?

1183
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,201
I don't know.
I don't know.

1184
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,563
What about the flabby guy?

1185
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,961
How's that?

1186
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,882
Yeah. Maybe.

1187
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,727
I need you to meet him.
We can do a double date.

1188
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,962
Not so you can decide
what you think of him.

1189
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,561
Please? I'm losing
all perspective here.

1190
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,802
Exactly! You don't
need somebody else's!

1191
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,562
Will you please just say yes
and do this for me? Please?

1192
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,167
They had stars
and suns and moons.

1193
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,481
I know. I hate those.

1194
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,929
Why do women like things that look
like they belong to children?

1195
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:31,007
You know what I love? Dollhouse furniture.
I would eat it if I could.

1196
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,763
Sometimes I wish I was single, just
so I could have girlie sheets.

1197
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,081
You would love that.

1198
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,005
I have flowery sheets. They're not
all they're cracked up to be.

1199
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,446
I like your flowery sheets.

1200
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,444
Oh! Don't sell
me out, man.

1201
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,446
We're new. I'd like her sheets if
they had little Mussolinis on them.

1202
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,681
Talk to me when
you get night tables.

1203
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,286
He has normal sheets,
but no night tables.

1204
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,285
So I don't have
night tables.

1205
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,602
Maybe it's a metaphor.

1206
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,520
Or maybe not!

1207
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,681
I don't know.

1208
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,281
I make a million compromises.
It just seems...

1209
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,364
...not having flowery
sheets is not a big deal.

1210
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,041
I know. I know you
make compromises.

1211
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,645
Really? What do
you think they are?

1212
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,041
This is not the time.

1213
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,521
Sometimes I wish
I was with somebody

1214
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,125
who was more
interested in history.

1215
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,884
What?
History.

1216
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,404
Okay.
I'm just saying.

1217
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,483
More guacamole?
Not for me.

1218
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,051
I'd love some, actually.

1219
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,322
You know how many calories
are in guacamole?

1220
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,401
Ten.

1221
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,730
Lay off the guy.
He likes guacamole.

1222
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,004
You know what?
We don't need the guac!

1223
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:44,006
I'll just stick
with the cheese.

1224
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:48,162
You know what I'm going to get you
as a present? A calorie book.

1225
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:50,687
Please don't.

1226
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:55,324
Yeah. A calorie book as
a gift is not so good.

1227
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,082
Eva tells me
you're a therapist.

1228
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,004
Tell us about your
weirdest patient.

1229
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,446
No, I can't.
She can't.

1230
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,366
Of course you can! You don't
have to name names, mate.

1231
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,602
You're so uptight
about confidentiality.

1232
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:10,841
Shouldn't she be?

1233
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,081
Well, you know.

1234
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:15,842
Okay. I have one patient who
picks his nose and eats it.

1235
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,531
Oh, man!

1236
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,770
In front of you?
Yes.

1237
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:20,961
Is he a child?

1238
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,531
Are you making this up?

1239
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,406
It is so gross
and distracting.

1240
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,802
He does it in this way he thinks I
can't see, but it's so obvious.

1241
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,042
I won't say who it is,
but he is famous.

1242
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,805
Really famous.
He is not!

1243
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,371
- I know who it is.
- You do?

1244
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,971
No, you don't.
I absolutely do.

1245
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,282
Please, Sarah,
tell us! Please!

1246
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,881
Okay! That's it!
Show's over!

1247
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,488
I like being drunk. I really
think it's highly overrated.

1248
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:44,721
Underrated!

1249
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:45,961
You're shouting.

1250
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,565
I am? No, I'm not.

1251
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,767
You are. A little.

1252
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,841
Okay, I'm sorry.

1253
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,407
I don't want to wake
up the small people.

1254
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,721
I'm sorry.

1255
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,925
You want to know
something funny?

1256
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,411
This one here
can't whisper.

1257
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,401
What?

1258
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,246
Will you do it right now?
Will you show them?

1259
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,650
I'm whispering.

1260
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,765
That was a whisper.

1261
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,970
Huh? What?
No, it's not.

1262
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,081
Can I?

1263
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,161
Yeah, that
was a whisper.

1264
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,811
What about me?

1265
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,251
Yes, you can whisper.

1266
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,764
This is whispering.

1267
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,080
No, it's not. That is
not a whisper at all.

1268
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,283
You're picking on him.
No, I'm not!

1269
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,760
You are.

1270
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,281
You kind of are.

1271
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,524
Okay, I'm sorry. I've just,
never in my entire life...

1272
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,286
...have I met anybody who
couldn't whisper at all.

1273
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,681
Whatever.

1274
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,364
No. You are not allowed to
complain about her anymore.

1275
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,120
Why the fuck is this
in the drawer? Cathy?

1276
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,283
Did you put this in the drawer?
No.

1277
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,686
Maybe one
of the kids did.

1278
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,881
That could be.

1279
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,202
But I think you put
it there, 'cause I find

1280
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,488
weird stuff in these
drawers all the time.

1281
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,041
I clean the best I can.

1282
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:15,244
I'm just trying to understand
the thought process.

1283
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,325
You like the
counters clean.

1284
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,804
Yeah, but not by shoving weird
shit in the wrong drawers.

1285
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,162
Does the ball
belong in the kitchen?

1286
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,401
That's enough.

1287
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,005
You know what,
Mrs. Sarah?

1288
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,129
I find your crap
everywhere.

1289
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,440
You think I know
where to put it?

1290
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,842
You leave stuff
all over the house.

1291
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,163
You let your children
write on the walls.

1292
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,323
You floss your
teeth and leave it.

1293
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,250
You clean your own house.

1294
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,766
You people disgust me.
But you is nice, Mr. Will.

1295
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,001
Thanks, Cathy!

1296
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,127
it really would have
been kinder to fire her.

1297
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,930
Oh, my God.

1298
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,851
Guys, my timing
might be a little off...

1299
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:11,203
...but I think I put
the ball in the drawer.

1300
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,601
Not funny.

1301
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,370
Are you serious?

1302
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,200
That wasn't a very
fun evening, was it?

1303
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,722
God! Yikes!

1304
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:30,409
Why do you care if I don't
know how to whisper?

1305
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,561
What was that?

1306
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,971
I mean,
that was embarrassing.

1307
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:40,248
I was just joking around.
That was complete... nothing.

1308
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,245
A calorie book?

1309
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,802
You're going to buy
me a calorie book?

1310
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,564
Okay, well, I'm sorry.

1311
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,644
I'm obviously not going to
buy you a calorie book.

1312
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,161
I thought you
actually liked me.

1313
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,604
I do like you.

1314
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,524
Why do I feel like I just spent
the evening with my ex-wife?

1315
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:22,362
Wait, what are you doing,
driving me home?

1316
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,441
Mmm-hmm.

1317
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,641
Oh.

1318
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,611
Are you going to
spend the night?

1319
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,282
No. Not tonight.

1320
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,806
Okay.

1321
01:08:58,800 --> 01:08:59,961
Hi.

1322
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:05,327
Ellen went out with friends, but I didn't
really want to go home. Is this okay?

1323
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,802
I'm glad you're here,
actually.

1324
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,644
I'm always so much more
comfortable at your house.

1325
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,924
You know...

1326
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:25,167
...you would be so welcome to stay
in Ellen's room once she's gone.

1327
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,768
You'd have to check with your
mom, but the room will be empty.

1328
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,684
Really?
Oh, yeah.

1329
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,682
That would be awesome.
Thank you so much.

1330
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,526
Sure.

1331
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,760
Thank you.

1332
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,843
Excuse me, Chloe,
but can I have my mom back?

1333
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:59,284
Honey, we were just watching
something and passed out.

1334
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,887
Next you'll be asking her to
move into my room when I'm gone.

1335
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,965
I'm sorry.

1336
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,565
No, it's not your
fault, sweetie.

1337
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,564
I better go home.

1338
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,963
Honey.

1339
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,883
Chloe is needy.

1340
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,565
Who's needy?

1341
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,724
You know, I guess I am...

1342
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:35,084
...just trying to feel
a little bit more separate.

1343
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,640
Sort of prepare.

1344
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:43,681
But instead, I just feel
lonely and anxious and...

1345
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:46,091
...Chloe is always here.

1346
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,922
I'm so sorry about that.

1347
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:57,241
But, Ellen,
you know you're my baby.

1348
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,764
Right, honey? Give Mommy a hug.
Will you sit with me?

1349
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,524
Can I see what Daddy
and Fran gave you?

1350
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,963
I'm going to
finish my blanket.

1351
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,805
They get you anything else?

1352
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,203
Oh, those are good. They don't
take up room. You'll use those.

1353
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:45,122
Hey, did you ever get a
chance to look at my book?

1354
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,561
Oh, I did!
You did?

1355
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,327
Yes. Your poems
are beautiful!

1356
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,325
I mean, not that I understand
them, but I like them.

1357
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,484
Thank you. And I'm sure
you understand them.

1358
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,641
Mom!

1359
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,561
We're out here!

1360
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,162
Dad's in the car.
I forgot my phone.

1361
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:11,007
Good, because I finally get
to introduce you guys.

1362
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,320
This is Eva.

1363
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,606
Tess!

1364
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,841
Hi?

1365
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,764
You guys know
each other?

1366
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,522
Uh, yeah, we
know each other.

1367
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,931
This is Tess.

1368
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:24,003
Mom, she's dating Dad.

1369
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,443
What?
You didn't know that?

1370
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,930
You date Albert?

1371
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,890
I'm not sure what's going on right now.
Wait a minute.

1372
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,083
Hello! Marianne!

1373
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,563
Sorry to interrupt, but, Tess,
we really have to get going.

1374
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,921
Hi!

1375
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,287
Hi.

1376
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,287
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

1377
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,440
She massages me.
We're friends.

1378
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,091
I thought.

1379
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,605
You're friends
with Marianne.

1380
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,082
I met you...

1381
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,082
...at a party and you
gave me your card...

1382
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,164
No, no. I gave
you my card.

1383
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,762
Yes. I think you
were at that same party.

1384
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,929
Yeah, I remember
the party.

1385
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,606
And you met us both.

1386
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,844
So now you're her masseuse?

1387
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:29,281
Yeah!

1388
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,847
For how long?

1389
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,849
Ever since we all met.

1390
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,804
Well, I didn't know...

1391
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,800
...who she was,
or who you... are, were.

1392
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,286
So...

1393
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,966
...you put it together
at some point, right?

1394
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,161
No.

1395
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,241
No?

1396
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,840
I'm sorry, at some
point, I, um...

1397
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,121
When?

1398
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,691
Well, I think...

1399
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,521
What?
When?

1400
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,484
When? Umm...

1401
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,401
Yeah.

1402
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,211
You got your phone?
Yeah.

1403
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,891
Okay, let's go.

1404
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,525
I'm so sorry.

1405
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,251
Are you okay?
Should I not be here?

1406
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,885
Probably not.

1407
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,765
Oh, I screwed up big time.
What happened?

1408
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,724
Oh, shit!

1409
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,725
Oh, that's my mom.

1410
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,051
Hi, Mom.

1411
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,922
I'm sorry, do you have a daughter?
'Cause this one's mine.

1412
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,447
Who do you think
you are, telling her

1413
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,728
she should have sex
with her boyfriend?

1414
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,248
You know what?
All she needs...

1415
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,930
No, you shut it!

1416
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,561
Dyke.

1417
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,602
I didn't tell you
about the kitchen remodel.

1418
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,441
They talked to the guys in
Rome about the travertine.

1419
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:12,128
Apparently when they were lifting
it up, it snapped or something...

1420
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,044
Is your dad here?

1421
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,725
He went to the market.

1422
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,121
Sorry to just
come over like this,

1423
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,641
but he hasn't been
returning my calls, so...

1424
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,123
I'll tell him
you came by.

1425
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,325
What are you
gonna do with that?

1426
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,401
You want one?

1427
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,644
Oh, sure.

1428
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,161
Hi.

1429
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,324
You know how many
calories are in that?

1430
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,725
I just want to talk.

1431
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,327
It really was
a coincidence. Okay?

1432
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,121
And I wanted it to stop.

1433
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:25,646
But she needed massages and we sort of...
Oh, thank you.

1434
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:28,811
We sort of
became friends...

1435
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,481
...and I didn't
know what to do.

1436
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,642
She needed massages?

1437
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,322
You knew what to do.
You just didn't do it.

1438
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,843
Well, I was very torn.

1439
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,845
So while you
were being torn...

1440
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,606
...she was poisoning
our relationship

1441
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,161
and poisoning your
perception of me.

1442
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,251
Why would you want that?

1443
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,851
I don't know.

1444
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,361
Mean...

1445
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,209
Except maybe I was trying to protect
myself, you know, because...

1446
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,681
...you know...

1447
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,890
...because we'd both been
married before, and...

1448
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,531
...you know how
things can turn out.

1449
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,124
What about us?
What about...

1450
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,051
...protecting us?

1451
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,804
I didn't protect us.

1452
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,725
And it didn't get
poisoned, Albert.

1453
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:43,568
I still really wanted us
to keep seeing each other.

1454
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,722
I wouldn't know how,
you know?

1455
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,407
I'm so, so, so sorry.

1456
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,730
I know this sounds...

1457
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,561
...corny...

1458
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,083
...but you broke my heart.

1459
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,082
And I'm too old
for that shit.

1460
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,250
And the worst part...

1461
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,809
...the worst part of
it is that you made me

1462
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,009
look like an idiot in
front of my daughter.

1463
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,162
I'm the idiot!

1464
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,410
I'm the idiot.

1465
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,842
Look, I got a lot to do.

1466
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,762
Tess and everything.
School

1467
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,001
When is she leaving?

1468
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:31,166
Next week. School
starts early for her.

1469
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,323
Yeah, same for Ellen.

1470
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,885
I guess we have to
get those hobbies going.

1471
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,531
Guess so.

1472
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,047
Bye.

1473
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,842
He just really,
really liked you.

1474
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,521
I just really,
really liked him.

1475
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,243
<i>Computer,
what's the point in this?</i>

1476
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:38,891
<i>You do all the thinking
where we...</i>

1477
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:45,605
<i>Just digging shelters
in the snow</i>

1478
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,725
<i>Build a house
of dream and domino</i>

1479
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:54,482
<i>I know it's fallen down</i>

1480
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:00,522
<i>Got my headphones on
and I won't hear a sound</i>

1481
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,965
<i>No, it's all broke down</i>

1482
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,968
<i>Eyes out on the road
but no one comes along</i>

1483
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,691
<i>When you want them to</i>

1484
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:41,328
<i>Let your hair hang long</i>

1485
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,441
<i>Yeah, that old north
wind is blowing</i>

1486
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:49,445
How will you know
which one is your room?

1487
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,485
It's all written down.
And remember, Mom,

1488
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,688
we saw everything
on our visit.

1489
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,647
I don't remember
anything.

1490
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,451
I do.

1491
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,040
She's going to be great.

1492
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,491
You're going to be great.

1493
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,201
I love you guys.

1494
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,481
I love you, too.

1495
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:30,766
<i>Computer,
what's the point in this?</i>

1496
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,846
<i>You do all the thinking
where we...</i>

1497
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:41,441
<i>Just building shelters

1498
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,606
<i>Build a house

1499
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:50,488
<i>I know it's fallen down</i>

1500
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:56,887
<i>Got my headphones on
and I won't hear a sound</i>

1501
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:02,086
<i>Yeah, it's all broke down</i>

1502
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,811
<i>Eyes out on the road

1503
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,531
<i>When you want them to</i>

1504
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,762
Well, we made a fine person.

1505
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,360
Hey, Eva!

1506
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,485
Do you think
you can help me?

1507
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,323
Of course!
Oh, my God.

1508
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,324
I'm such an idiot!
I'm sorry.

1509
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:34,166
Sorry. Is that... Jeez.

1510
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,005
I'm sorry.

1511
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,691
This thing's heavy.

1512
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,164
We always go to my mother's
house for Thanksgiving...

1513
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,129
...and I get in a fight
with my sister and brother.

1514
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,044
My sister's a middle child,
so she has issues.

1515
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,362
Anyway, what are you doing?

1516
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,204
Huh? What are you doing
for the holiday?

1517
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,929
I'm going to my
friend's house.

1518
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,844
It's going to be
a small group, but...

1519
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,281
That sounds nice.

1520
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,526
Oh, yeah.

1521
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,051
Hi, honey.

1522
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,485
Oh, thank you so much.

1523
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,045
No problem.

1524
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,050
It really smells
good in here!

1525
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,930
Yeah? I can't
smell it anymore.

1526
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:46,040
It's unbelievably delicious sound...
Sounding. Smelling.

1527
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,411
You excited?

1528
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,082
Oh, my God,
beyond!

1529
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,402
You think she'll
look different?

1530
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,768
Yeah, maybe she grew
a beard or something.

1531
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:04,922
You know how it is
at Sarah Lawrence.

1532
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:08,609
No, she looks the same.
I Skyped with her yesterday.

1533
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,205
Actually, I think
she's gained weight.

1534
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,090
What time are
you picking her up?

1535
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,804
Not till two.

1536
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,644
We're eating at
five... you should just

1537
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,410
come straight here
from the airport.

1538
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,404
Oh, let's use
the fancy plates.

1539
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,404
But you say you
don't like them.

1540
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,529
I know. But it's
Thanksgiving...

1541
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,483
you're supposed to
use the ugly plates.

1542
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,165
Okay, I'll see you. Bye.

1543
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,243
Bye, Eva!
Bye, Cathy.

1544
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,121
Hi.

1545
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,130
Oh, wow.

1546
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,481
Okay.

1547
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,761
I don't always park
in front of your house.

1548
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,842
I usually just drive by.

1549
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,841
Sometimes I drive
by your house, too.

1550
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,161
You do?

1551
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,211
You look good.

1552
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,521
You, too.

1553
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:50,927
Thank you.

1554
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,441
Is Tess coming home
for Thanksgiving?

1555
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:02,202
She's already here.
She's over at her mother's.

1556
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,482
I'm going over
there later.

1557
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,371
You want to come?

1558
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,042
And Ellen is...

1559
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:19,089
This afternoon. She's
coming home this afternoon.

1560
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,245
You been okay
without her?

1561
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,244
Oh, sure, yeah.

1562
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,244
I mean, she's
not going back.

1563
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:31,890
'Cause I've
built a cage.

1564
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,491
What a good idea!

1565
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,090
I've missed you.

1566
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:50,285
I missed you, too.

1567
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:06,886
Oh, I should tell you...
I bought some night tables.

1568
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,771
You did?

1569
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:10,961
No.

1570
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,451
No, I didn't.

1571
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,807
Okay. That's good.

1572
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:11,770
<i>I like your toothy smile</i>

1573
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:17,889
<i>It never fails to beguile</i>

1574
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,570
<i>Whichever way
the wind is blowing</i>

1575
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,963
<i>I like the way this is going</i>

1576
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,649
<i>I like to watch TV with you</i>

1577
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,170
<i>There's really nothing</i>

1578
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,767
<i>That I would rather do</i>

1579
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,730
<i>Then maybe we can go to bed</i>

1580
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,728
<i>And get up
and do it all again</i>

1581
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:57,448
<i>I like the way your pants fit</i>

1582
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:03,164
<i>And how you stand
and how you sit</i>

1583
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:08,763
<i>Whatever seeds
that you're sowing</i>

1584
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:14,323
<i>I like the way this is going</i>

1585
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,771
<i>I don't care about the past</i>

1586
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:28,484
<i>None of it was made to last</i>

1587
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,643
<i>It's not who you've known</i>

1588
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,128
<i>But who you're knowing</i>

1589
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:39,603
<i>I like the way this is going</i>

1590
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:45,562
<i>I like the way this is going</i>
