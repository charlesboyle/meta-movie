00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,154
What's going on?

186
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,243
The Sheriff came by looking for Dad.

187
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,620
If he don't show up for his court date,

188
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,913
we're gonna lose the house.

189
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,211
I gotta get down to the Arkansas line.

190
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,463
l gotta ask him.

191
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,423
lt's his truck.

192
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,684
[coos]

193
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,479
[cooing]

194
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,489
He said no.

195
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,115
Did you tell him I'd spring for gas?

196
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,034
l told him. He still won't.

197
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,577
Why not?

198
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,954
He never says why not to me, Ree.

199
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,664
He just says no.

200
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,666
Man, that's so sad to hear you say

201
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,794
he won't let you do something
and then you don't do it.

202
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,296
lt's different once you're married.

203
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:06,135
lt really must be because you ain't
never used to eat no shit.

204
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,223
Ned needs his nap.

205
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,393
Come here.

206
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,109
[door opens]

207
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,296
[dog barks]

208
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,672
[door opens]

209
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,049
What brings you here?

210
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,051
Somebody dead?

211
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,761
l'm looking for my Dad.

212
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,183
Come on in. Shake off the chill.

213
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,188
Let's keep it quiet.

214
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,982
Teardrop's still laying up in bed.

215
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,783
The law came by today.

216
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,120
Dad signed over everything to his bond.

217
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:19,459
Victoria, I really gotta run
Dad down to get him to show.

218
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,294
- [cigarette lighter clicks]
- [Teardrop] You ought not do that.

219
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,297
Don't go running after Jessup.

220
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,011
Show or don't show,
that choice is up to the one going to jail,

221
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,971
not you.

222
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,974
You know where he's at, don't you?

223
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:39,520
Where a man's at ain't necessarily
for you to know, neither.

224
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,731
- But you do.
- I ain't seen him.

225
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:53,534
Could be running around
with Little Arthur and them, you think?

226
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,036
Don't you ever go down
around Little Arthur's

227
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,456
asking them people about shit
they ain't offering to talk about.

228
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,335
That's a real good way
to end up bit by hogs...

229
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,003
or wishing you was.

230
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,255
[clip snaps into pistol]

231
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,383
We're all related, ain't we?

232
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,262
[chuckles]

233
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:17,892
Our relations get watered kind of thin
between here and Little Arthur's.

234
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,644
You know all those people, Teardrop.

235
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,479
- You could ask--
- Shut up.

236
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,816
None of them's gonna be
in a great big hurry to tangle with you.

237
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,026
l said shut up once already
with my mouth.

238
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,911
Jesus. Dad's your only brother.

239
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,747
You think I forgot that?

240
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,374
Hm?

241
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,043
Jessup and me run together
for coming on 40 years,

242
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,753
but l don't know where he's at,

243
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,589
and l ain't gonna go around
asking after him, neither.

244
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,597
Ree, you still planning to join the Army?

245
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,183
No, l don't think l can anymore.

246
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,771
- Listen.
- [grunts]

247
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,523
[gasps]

248
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,066
Hm?

249
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,071
No.

250
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,908
[gasps]

251
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,560
[Victoria]
She needs help.

252
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,895
[Teardrop]
Nope. Listen.

253
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,772
Listen.

254
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,984
You tell that girl to stay close to home.

255
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,111
Don't move.

256
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,197
Give her this.

257
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,908
You send her ass on her way right now.

258
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:07,960
Teardrop says you best keep
your ass real close to the willows, dear.

259
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,463
- He hopes this helps.
- [money crinkles]

260
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,723
Here's a doobie for your walk.

261
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,475
Thank you.

262
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,748
[Woman]
Hey.

263
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,500
What's your business here?

264
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,252
My dad's Jessup.

265
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,338
He's pals with Little Arthur,
and I gotta find him.

266
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,888
Hold on.

267
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,653
[door closes]

268
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,161
My name's Megan.

269
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,415
And l do know you, really.

270
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,250
I seen you at some of the reunions.

271
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,254
I knew Jessup when I seen him, too.

272
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,132
Never did talk with him much.

273
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,801
You knew him?

274
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,764
Knew him when I seen him
around, I mean.

275
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,766
He does stuff l hear about.

276
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,644
- He cooks crank.
- They all do now.

277
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,479
You don't even need to say it out loud.

278
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,949
[Megan]
If Arthur's been running
on crank for a day or two,

279
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,909
you shouId just leave, okay?

280
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,962
l knew it.

281
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,297
l been in your dreams,
ain't l, little Ruthie?

282
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,092
lt's Ree, you asshole.

283
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,844
l'm only out to find Dad.

284
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,848
Come on in, ladies.

285
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,189
[makes kissing sounds]

286
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,320
This don't gotta take long, man.

287
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,864
l'm looking for Dad and thought maybe
you'd been seeing him.

288
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,993
Maybe you two been getting
into stuff together again.

289
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,580
Not since the summer,

290
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,332
at ya'll's place.

291
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,334
You ain't seen him nowhere since then?

292
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,877
Uh-uh.

293
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,466
He kept leaving
the house, going some place.

294
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,052
You don't know where?

295
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,804
You got cat shit in your ear, girl?

296
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,391
I've got them two kids
and my Mom to tend, man.

297
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,059
l need him.

298
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:56,355
If I see the dude, I'll tell him you said
that.

299
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,612
[Megan]
Your dad left you to do all that?

300
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,406
That's fucked up.

301
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,994
Well, he had to.

302
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,831
The way things go, you know.

303
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,925
You want a line?

304
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,220
No.

305
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,930
You wanna blow some smoke?

306
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,892
No.

307
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,852
[slams table]
Then l guess l got nothin' for you.

308
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,190
Go on.

309
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,994
Don't tell nobody it was me
who told you this, okay?

310
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,079
[distant gunshots]

311
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,789
But you're going to have to go on
up the hill

312
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,291
and ask for a talk with Thump Milton.

313
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,086
Now, l hope he'll talk with you.

314
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,088
He generally won't.

315
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,882
That man scares me
way more than the rest.

316
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:08,135
Well, scared ain't a bad way
to be about him, neither, hon.

317
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,678
He's my own grandpa,

318
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,473
and l still make damn sure
l never piss him off none.

319
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,437
You go see Thump.

320
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,233
[faint gunshot]

321
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,901
Go on.

322
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,640
[dogs barking]

323
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,693
You got the wrong place, I expect.

324
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,612
Who might you be?

325
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,157
l'm Ree.

326
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,200
My Dad's Jessup Dolly.

327
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,836
You ain't here for trouble, are you?

328
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,838
No, ma'am.

329
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,048
'Cause one of my nephews is Buster Leroy,

330
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,302
and didn't he shoot
your daddy one time?

331
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,930
Yes, but that ain't got
nothing to do with me.

332
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,932
They settled that theirselves, I think.

333
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,934
Shooting him likely settled it.

334
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,396
What is it you want?

335
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,399
I got a real bad need to talk with Thump.

336
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,444
And he ain't got no need to talk to you.

337
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,906
But I need to.

338
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,326
I really, I really, really
got to, ma'am, please.

339
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,872
Some of our blood at least is the same.

340
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,290
Ain't that supposed to mean something?

341
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,167
Ain't that what is always said?

342
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,761
Ain't you got no men could do this?

343
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,554
No, ma'am, I don't.

344
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,561
You go wait in the yard
somewhere by that coop,

345
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,564
and l'll tell Thump you're here.

346
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,899
Thanks.

347
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,018
Come on, already.

348
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,993
He ain't likely to have time for you, child.

349
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,744
l've got to talk to him.

350
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,621
If he don't know, nobody does.

351
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,998
Nope.

352
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,710
Talking just causes witnesses,
and he don't want for any of those.

353
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,378
l'll wait.

354
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,340
You need to get yourself on home.

355
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,428
Here, drink it down and be on your way.

356
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,273
Thanks.

357
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,236
Thump knows you were in the valley, child,

358
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:58,032
with Megan, and at Little Arthur's.

359
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,868
He knows what you want to ask,
and he don't want to hear it.

360
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,911
And that's it?

361

Jessup and me
may have had our tussles,

392
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,798
but he was my cousin.

393
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,926
It's always a bad deal
when these things blow.

394

Where are we going?

395
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,346

I know it, but something
must have jumped wrong this time.

He's known for never fucking up labs
or cooking bad batches.

what he's doing.

this is bound to happen.

418
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,996
We could take him and raise
him up the rest of the way.

419

My ass you will.

420
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,750
We'd raise that boy way better

421

than you and that
nut-job mama of yours can.

422
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,796
Maybe on down the line
we'd take Ashlee, too.

423
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,882
You go straight to hell, you son of a bitch.

424
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:10,010
Sonny and Ashlee will die
living in a cave with me and Mama

425
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,804
before they spend one night with you.

426
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,559
God damn you.

427
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,645
You must think I'm a stupid idiot.

428
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,813
There's weeds growing
chin high in that place.

429

lt must have been a year
since that place blew.

Come here, look at this.
Ash, quit playing around. Come here.

This trigger shoots this barrel.

432
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,745
Now, there's hardly ever
gonna be a time where you need both,

433
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,456
but if you gotta kill something
big and mean, then you use both.

434
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:25,794
Now, this gun is what
you'll use when you're older,

435
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,047
but this one is the gun I learned on.

436
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,174
This is Daddy's squirrel gun.

437
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,676
Now, the most important thing is

438
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,138
do not put your finger on the trigger
unless you're ready to shoot,

439
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,723
you're aimed at your target.

440
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,475
And don't ever-- both of you look at me--

441
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,146
never point this at each other, not ever.

442
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,981
All right?

443
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,607
Kneel down like you're praying.

444
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,860
Yeah, just like that. Yup.

445
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,406
You see that cross?

446
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,575
lt's called the crosshairs.

447
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,827
Aim that up with the middle
of your target,

448
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,495
and when that's lined up in the middle,

449
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,247
then you squeeze
the trigger and you shoot.

[Ree]
lt's not time for deer.

539
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,665
When is it?

540
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,751

You know that.

Do you see one?

542
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,509
- Mmm.

543
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:50,261
Where?

544
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,596
There.

545
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,432
Ah.

546
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:58,228
You want to help me pull the trigger?

547
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,105
All right, put your finger right there.

548
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,485
All right, you guys want
these fried or stewed?

549
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,903
- Fried.
- Fried.

550
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,196
Fried?

551
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,614
All right.

552
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,790
- Hey.
- [Gail] Hey.

553
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,548
All right.
Now, get your fingers in there.

554
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,174
l'll get mine in.

555
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,844
1 , 2, 3.

556
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,720
Pull. Pull hard.

557
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,394
Now, l'm just gonna slit it down here.

558
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,192
Now, get in there
and get them guts out.

560
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,321
Sonny, there's a bunch of stuff

561
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,240
that you're gonna have to get over
being scared of.

562
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,325
l'm not scared. l just don't want to.

563
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,496
Come on.

564
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,915
Put your fingers in there.

565
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,838
Good.

566
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,760
Do we eat these parts?

567
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,137
Not yet.

That's your business.
You forget us if you want.

The law found Jessup's car
at Gullet Lake this morning.

574
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,198
Somebody set fire to it last night,

575
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,659

576
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,577
He wasn't in it.

577
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,960

His court day was this morning.
He didn't show.

581
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,101
I'd sell off your timber land
now while you can.

582
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,853
No, uh-uh.
We won't be doin' nothin' like that.

583
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,606
That's the very first thing they'll do.

584
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:52,110
Once they've took this place
from under you all, girl,

585
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:55,154
go out and cut them
hundred-year woods down to nubs.

586
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,995
Might as well have the dough
to spend on your own.

587
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,246

You get the taste for it yet?

592
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,641
Not so far.

593
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,895
Suit yourself, little girl.

594
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,400

your mama's mood any?

595
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:36,446
She keeps takin' them,
but they ain't working.

602
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,771
Mom, look at me.

603

Teardrop thinks
I should sell the woods, Mom.

604
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,327
Should I sell?

605
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,251
Please, help me this one time.

606

[Ree]
Who the hell is he?

608
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:49,555
[Gail]
Judging by that car, he ain't
from our neck of the woods.

609
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,862
Mike Satterfield, A-1 Bonds.

610
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,448
What is it you want?

611
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,866
We hold the bond on Jessup Dolly,

612
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,868
and now he's a runner, it looks like.

613
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,411
Dad ain't no runner.

614
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,413
He didn't show for court.
That makes him a runner.

615
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,583
Will you excuse us, please?

616
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,418
Go on.

617
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,173
Look, I don't want to kick
your dad's ass, all right?

618
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,133
I just want to keep the judge off mine.

619
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,219
Dad is dead.

620
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,638
He didn't show for court
'cause he's lying dead somewhere.

621
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,014
When was the last time you saw him?

622
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,891
A couple of weeks.

623
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,269
Who's he running around with?
Where they all hanging out?

624
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,479
He doesn't tell me that stuff, sir.

625
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,939
You know I got the legal right

626
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,608
to go in there hunting the man
any place l want.

627
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,694
I know you'd be wasting your time

628
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:47,613
and pissing me off.

629
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,699
Jessup Dolly is dead.

630
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,742
He's lying in a crappy grave somewhere

631
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,953
or become piles of shit in a hog pen.

632
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,622
Maybe he's been left out plain in the open.

633
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,041
Wherever he is, he's there dead.

634
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,043
And you know this how?

635
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,795
You must've heard what Dollys are,
ain't you, mister?

636
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,422
Well, I've heard what some are anyhow,

637
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,465
and I have bonded a few.

638
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,676
I'm a Dolly, bred and buttered,

639
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,054
and that's how l know Dad's dead.

640
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,562
How old are you?

641
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,147
1 7.

642
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:31,949
You know, uh, your daddy
was short on his bond.

643
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:35,369
This house and stuff here
couldn't cover it, not nearly.

644
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,580
D'you know that?

645
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,707
I didn't know nothin'.
They told me everything after.

646
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,835
Well, he was short on his bond,

647
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,129
but then this fella comes
in the office one evening,

648
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,964
got him a sack full of crinkled money

649
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:50,259
and just laid it down right there,
covered the rest.

650
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:54,347
Seemed like somebody
needed him sprung in a hurry.

651
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,098
This fella with the money have a name?

652
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,975
Shit, no.

653
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,977
Probably left that in his other pants.

654
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:11,572

kicked off our own property?

l reckon you all got this place
about another week.

657
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,371
That's my guess.

658
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,789
A week?

659
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,582
And there ain't nothing l can do?

660
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,875
Nope.

661
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,377
Ain't nothing left to do...

662
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,464

down here today, Ree?

Um, I wanted to find out more
about the $40,000 I get for signing up.

Well, that's a good reason
for joining,

but why don't you give me
three better reasons for joining?

Because once you join up,
there's no turning back,

$40,000 dollars to you.

is I need the money.

- I am.
- You are?

Yes, sir.

it might be a bigger challenge

01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:57,971
just to stay home, you know,

841
01:06:58,055 --> 01:06:59,681
and actually take care
of your brother and sister

842
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:01,558
because you know you're not
going to be able to take them

843
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:03,184
with you to training, right?

844
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,437
I thought maybe I could.

845
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,188
Not right at the beginning.

846
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,441
Plus you wouldn't be able to have them

847
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,401
when you're actually
in the active duty Army

848
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,153
because who's going to be
there to take care of them

849

if you have to go off and actually fight?

850
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,200
So it sounds like right now

851
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,703
you need to buckle up and stay home.

852
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:24,122
It's going to take a lot of backbone
and a lot of courage to stay home,

853

right at this point.

But don't take it lightly,
and don't do it just for the money.
