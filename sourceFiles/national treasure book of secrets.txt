1
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,900
[man] He's in the other room.

2
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:28,505
- Are you Thomas Gates?
- Yes.

3
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,380
We got something
that we'd like you to take a look at.

4
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,744
I hear you're quite good
with puzzles and riddles.

5
00:01:36,355 --> 00:01:40,621
- [man] It's a coded message.
- [Gates] It's a Playfair cipher.

6
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,624
- Playfair cipher?
- Can you decode it?

7
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:47,187
Cipher's impossible to decode
without the key.

8
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:51,429
- What do you mean by "a key"?
- A keyword or phrase.

9
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:54,870
I believe what you need is right there.

10
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,931
It'll take some time.

11
00:01:58,977 --> 00:02:03,004
Go on. I'll take your diary.
I'll meet up with you later.

12
00:02:07,386 --> 00:02:10,116
- [horse grunts]
- Whoa.

13
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:28,702
[man]...calculate the distance
and you're sure to hit the mark

14
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:31,039
in about most things
as well as shootin'.

15
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,101
[laughter]

16
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,916
...ready to pour out all over you
like apple sass over roast pork.

17
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:38,973
[laughter]

18
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:46,225
[woman] I'll take care not to
give up my hold on poor De Boots

19
00:02:46,392 --> 00:02:48,860
till I am quite sure of the American.

20
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:53,695
- [woman 2] Ah, that's my own girl.
- [laughter]

21
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:55,667
Augusta, dear, to your room.

22
00:02:59,273 --> 00:03:04,108
[man]...to turn you inside out, old
gal, you sockdologizing old man-trap.

23
00:03:04,178 --> 00:03:06,476
- [audience laughs]
- [screaming]

24
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:15,785
Sic semper tyrannis!

25
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,885
- [grunts]
- [horse whinnies]

26
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:29,197
[indistinct chatter]

27
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:33,968
Temples.

28
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:36,837
Gold.

29
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:40,378
Cibola? This is a treasure map.

30
00:03:42,183 --> 00:03:46,210
KGC? You're Knights of the
Golden Circle. You're a traitor.

31
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:48,312
You're all traitors.

32
00:03:50,258 --> 00:03:54,092
- [man] President Lincoln's been shot!
- [man 2] Everybody, out! All of you!

33
00:03:54,162 --> 00:03:56,096
[boy] Killer's on the loose!

34
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,593
I'd much appreciate it if you'd finish
deciphering that code now.

35
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,501
- [glass shatters]
- [shouting]

36
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:08,169
[grunts]

37
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:10,541
- Dad!
- The war is over.

38
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:13,909
No!

39
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,784
- No!
- [gasping] No!

40
00:04:26,128 --> 00:04:27,857
You're wrong about that.

41
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:31,563
The war has only just begun!

42
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,740
[gasping] Charles.
The debt that all men... men pay.

43
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:42,606
The debt that all men p... [stammers]

44
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:45,970
Dad! No, please!

45
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:54,317
[sobbing] Come back. It's not fair.

46
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:57,587
Help! Somebody help, please!

47
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:01,086
So recapping:

48
00:05:01,164 --> 00:05:05,191
The Knights of the Golden Circle
was a Southern extremist group,

49
00:05:05,268 --> 00:05:08,396
operating in the north
to subvert Union forces.

50
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:13,033
Had Thomas not burned the legendary
missing pages from the Booth diary,

51
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:16,044
the killers may have found
a vast treasure of gold,

52
00:05:16,112 --> 00:05:19,047
and the Union may well have
lost the Civil War.

53
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:21,481
- Thank you.
- [applause]

54
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,718
[man] I'd like
to thank Ben and Patrick Gates.

55
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,779
Thank you.

56
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:34,127
And say what a wonderful addition Thomas
Gates is to our civilian heroes exhibit.

57
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:35,187
Thank you.

58
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:39,665
Thank you, Dr. Nichols.
I only wish my grandfather

59
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:41,967
had been here to see this wonderful day.

60
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:44,564
[man] Excuse me.
I have a question I'd like to ask.

61
00:05:44,642 --> 00:05:47,440
What do you think happened
to that Booth diary page

62
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:50,412
- that was pulled out of the fire?
- We may never know.

63
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:51,914
Perhaps.

64
00:05:52,617 --> 00:05:55,643
- Perhaps not.
- [crowd murmuring]

65
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,486
You see, I have one of those
great-great-granddaddies, like you,

66
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,356
way up in my family tree,
name of Silas Wilkinson.

67
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:07,352
He used to tell a story
about the night Lincoln was shot.

68
00:06:07,698 --> 00:06:09,394
As Silas tells it,

69
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:13,700
Booth didn't seek out Thomas Gates
regarding the treasure map that night.

70
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:16,566
It was Thomas who called the meeting.

71
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,543
A meeting to plan
the assassination of Lincoln.

72
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:22,102
- How absurd.
- That's a lie!

73
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,408
[crowd murmuring]

74
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:26,349
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you...

75
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:31,545
...one of the missing pages from the
infamous diary of John Wilkes Booth

76
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:36,322
with the name Thomas Gates written on
a list along with all the other killers.

77
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:42,925
- And Latin?
- Booth was a student of Latin.

78
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:46,198
He shouted, "Sic semper tyrannis"
after he shot Lincoln.

79
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,799
- "Thus always to..."
- "Thus always to tyrants." We know.

80
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,503
- "Surratt, copiae"?
- Military supplies.

81
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,912
Mary Surratt was convicted and hanged

82
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,883
for supplying Booth with
a rifle and field glasses.

83
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,921
- "Thomas Gates, artifex."
- "Designer"

84
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:11,361
- or "mastermind."
- I know what it means.

85
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,695
He must have,
uh, planned the assassination.

86
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,760
- I see.
- Could mean mastermind of anything.

87
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,466
You see that?
Burned out right there.

88
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:26,144
I can only imagine how difficult
this must be for you.

89
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:29,011
- May l, Mr...?
- Wilkinson.

90
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,779
I'll see if this new page
matches the Booth diary.

91
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:35,015
This is an outrage.
You're calling my grandfather a liar.

92
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:38,650
With respect, now you're calling
my great-great-granddaddy a liar.

93
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:41,923
Yes, sir, I am. This isn't
some garbage from a history book.

94
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,361
My grandfather
told me this story himself.

95
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,867
- I saw the truth of it in his eyes.
- I'm sorry, sir. I truly am.

96
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,738
We'll test this thoroughly,
Patrick, to authenticate it.

97
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,784
It can't be.

98
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:08,986
Maps to presidents' houses.

99
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:12,558
Keys to locks that don't exist.

100
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:16,753
What's the point?
What am I looking for?

101
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:20,296
Proof, proof, proof.

102
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:23,134
What proof?

103
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,417
Oh, wow. Is this a book
about the Templar treasure?

104
00:08:47,496 --> 00:08:52,024
Yes, it is about the Templar treasure,
but it's also about other things.

105
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:56,595
Conspiracy theories, urban legends
and other myths that are true.

106
00:08:56,672 --> 00:09:00,130
- So the author's here signing copies?
- I'm the author.

107
00:09:00,943 --> 00:09:02,604
- You are?
- Yeah. See, uh...

108
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:05,374
There's a picture of me right there.

109
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:09,174
I think it's a pretty good picture.

110
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:12,550
I thought that guy,
Benjamin Gates, found the treasure.

111
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:16,489
Well, yes, Ben did,
but I am the co-finder.

112
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,619
- Oh, I've never heard of you.
- Oh!

113
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,398
Oh, my gosh. Are you Ben Gates?

114
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:32,300
- Yes. Yes, I am.
- Do you own a red Ferrari?

115
00:09:34,978 --> 00:09:37,538
- Yes, I do.
- Well, it's being towed.

116
00:09:37,614 --> 00:09:38,808
Hm?

117
00:09:42,185 --> 00:09:43,516
[laughs]

118
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:51,187
Wait! Wait! That's my car!

119
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:55,160
[wheels squeaking]

120
00:09:58,134 --> 00:09:59,362
Where's the Ferrari?

121
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:03,764
- IRS impounded it.
- The IRS?

122
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,437
Funny story.
My accountant set up a corporation

123
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:10,707
on an island that didn't exist

124
00:10:10,781 --> 00:10:13,807
and assured me
that that's how rich people do it.

125
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:18,515
Then I got audited and slapped
with a huge fine plus interest.

126
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:22,482
Wanna know what taxes
are on five million dollars?

127
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,858
Six million dollars.

128
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,724
But enough about me.

129
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:30,164
[sighs] What's new with you?

130
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:35,103
Well, my girlfriend kicked me out,
I'm living with my dad,

131
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:38,300
- my family killed President Lincoln.
- All right.

132
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:41,211
I need your help.

133
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:44,506
[man] I can't believe
you have to break into your own house.

134
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:48,280
[Ben] I need to get Abigail's ID.
She has access to the Booth diary page.

135
00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:50,480
Why don't you ask Abigail for her help?

136
00:10:50,555 --> 00:10:53,956
She changed the alarm code, Riley.
She's not going to talk to me.

137
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:55,084
All right.

138
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,620
We have 30 seconds after
the alert starts to disable the alarm.

139
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:03,099
- Go.
- [beeping]

140
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:11,899
I'll probably regret asking this, but
what happened with you and Abigail?

141
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:15,743
I don't know. I don't know.
She started using the word "so" a lot.

142
00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:17,213
"So?"

143
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:20,342
Yeah, like,
"So, I guess my opinion doesn't matter."

144
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:24,322
"So, you seem to always know what's
best." "So, I guess I'm invisible."

145
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,154
Now I've moved out,
we're dividing furniture...

146
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:29,023
- [beeping]
- [Riley] Oh.

147
00:11:29,095 --> 00:11:33,623
Women. Can't live with them, especially
if they change the alarm codes.

148
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:35,728
You did that in 25 seconds.

149
00:11:36,302 --> 00:11:38,293
That's why I tell people to get a dog.

150
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,869
- Got it.
- All right, let's go.

151
00:11:43,676 --> 00:11:45,541
[car approaching]

152
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:51,974
[Ben] That's not Abigail's car.

153
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:56,021
[Ben] She was on a date.

154
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,581
Isn't that that guy?
The White House guy?

155
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:03,390
The White House Easter Egg Roll
is next Monday. Maybe if you're not...

156
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,419
He's weird!

157
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:07,160
[Abigail] What happens if kids
don't find all the eggs?

158
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:09,964
[man] Wow. You work in a museum,
and you live in one.

159
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:11,299
[Abigail] Pretty much.

160
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:13,897
What clever repartee.
She must like him.

161
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:17,000
[Abigail] All right, let me give you
a tour of the house.

162
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:19,602
- OK.
- That's actually kind of...

163
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,409
Oh, Abigail.

164
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,214
- What are you doing here?
- I just needed to get some things.

165
00:12:25,285 --> 00:12:28,686
- Connor, good to see you again.
- Gates.

166
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:30,980
How did you get in, Ben?

167
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:36,594
Riley! Come out here!

168
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,659
What? [laughs]

169
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,870
Hey! What are you doing here?
I mean, it's your house, but...

170
00:12:46,941 --> 00:12:49,967
I sent you a copy of my book.
Did you get a chance...?

171
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:53,071
- No, I haven't read it yet.
- Mm.

172
00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:56,142
I know you.
You're the White House curator.

173
00:12:56,217 --> 00:13:00,779
- I'm Riley. We met, uh, back in...
- Right. You're, uh, Ben's assistant.

174
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:02,522
What?

175
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,184
Um, maybe I should go.

176
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,889
- Yeah, I'm really...
- Dinner tomorrow night?

177
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:12,192
I... I actually already
have plans for tomorrow.

178
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:13,529
You do?

179
00:13:14,736 --> 00:13:17,466
- Of course you do.
- But I'm free on Friday.

180
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:20,634
- Awkward.
- Oh, great. [laughs]

181
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:23,838
- Good night.
- Good night.

182
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:27,113
I cannot believe you broke in.

183
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:29,777
- What did you take?
- It's just my things.

184
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,547
Hand it over, Ben.

185
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:35,181
[sighs] I need to see
the Booth diary page.

186
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:39,057
You saw the page yourself.
There is no treasure map on it.

187
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:42,928
No, it's a cipher leading to a map.
Anyone spectral-image the page?

188
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:46,297
No need to. The ink writing
on the page is clearly visible.

189
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,563
It could have been erased or faded.

190
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:52,095
You're the director of document
conservation. You know this.

191
00:13:52,174 --> 00:13:54,165
Not up to me.
It's not my department.

192
00:13:54,243 --> 00:13:56,768
That department reports
to your department.

193
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,144
Come on. One look under infrared.

194
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:01,173
You can have the Boston Tea Tables.

195
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:08,320
Both of them?

196
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:11,523
[beeping]

197
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:14,428
[Riley] We've been looking
at this page for hours.

198
00:14:14,498 --> 00:14:16,090
There's nothing there.

199
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:21,370
Ben, I really don't think we're
going to find anything on this page.

200
00:14:21,438 --> 00:14:23,872
In a hundred years,
no one's going to remember

201
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,239
anyone involved in the Lincoln
assassination besides Booth.

202
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,474
That's not true. Do you know
the expression, "His name is mud"?

203
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:33,572
- Yes. Of course.
- You do?

204
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:38,588
- You know the origin of the expression?
- Does anyone but you?

205
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:42,319
Dr. Samuel Mudd was convicted
of being a co-conspirator

206
00:14:42,393 --> 00:14:46,056
in the Lincoln assassination.
The evidence was circumstantial.

207
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,928
He was later pardoned,
but it didn't matter.

208
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,767
Mudd's name still lives in infamy. And l
will not let Thomas Gates' name be mud.

209
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:57,903
- [Abigail] Ben.
- What?

210
00:14:58,009 --> 00:14:59,374
Look at this.

211
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:03,136
- See that?
- Oh.

212
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:07,981
- That's quite something, isn't it?
- Yeah. It says "smudge."

213
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:10,184
It's nothing.

214
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:15,924
Residual ink
from the facing page. Flip it.

215
00:15:16,594 --> 00:15:18,426
The letters are backwards.

216
00:15:18,497 --> 00:15:20,488
- It's a cipher.
- Yes. It is.

217
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:22,864
A cipher.
See how the letters are coupled?

218
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:28,703
Playfair ciphers encode letters
in pairs. This could prove his story.

219
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:33,177
Unless you decode the cipher,
this does not prove a theory.

220
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:35,475
That's OK.
We need a five-letter keyword.

221
00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:37,845
- What's the keyword?
- I don't know yet.

222
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,680
- All right.
- Uh, can I get a printout of this?

223
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:43,653
[Riley] There's a billion words
in the English language.

224
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:46,782
Got to be a logical...
Let's start from the beginning.

225
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:48,416
A. Aardvark.

226
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:52,486
Don't want to rain on your parade here,
but I don't think this is gonna stop

227
00:15:52,564 --> 00:15:56,524
Dr. Nichols from announcing
the discovery of the page tomorrow.

228
00:15:56,603 --> 00:16:01,404
No, now, wait. Can't you ask him to
wait until I prove Thomas is innocent?

229
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,436
What if he isn't innocent?

230
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,239
[beeping]

231
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:18,783
Sir? Looks like our old friend
Ben Gates is in the news again.

232
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:20,985
What did he find now? Atlantis?

233
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,756
A guy came forward
with a missing Booth diary page.

234
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,889
That's not the best part.
Listen to this.

235
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:28,058
"On the page are the names
of the conspirators

236
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:32,161
in the Lincoln assassination, as well
as a previously unknown conspirator,

237
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:35,868
Thomas Gates. Thomas Gates is said
to be the great-great-grandfather

238
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:38,537
of treasure hunter
Benjamin Franklin Gates."

239
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:42,514
- [woman] Thought my relatives were bad.
- What do we know about this Wilkinson?

240
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:46,781
- Sir?
- Guy claims he had this page

241
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:50,187
for 140 years then just suddenly
comes forward with it?

242
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,525
- Why?
- We'll find out.

243
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:55,095
Better.

244
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:55,891
Better.

245
00:16:56,764 --> 00:16:58,061
Bacon.

246
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:01,161
[beeping]

247
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:02,930
- Keep going.
- That's stupid.

248
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:11,201
- How's he doing?
- Keep working.

249
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:15,812
[Nichols] We're grateful
to the Wilkinson family

250
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:17,579
for coming forth with the page.

251
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:22,521
On the page is a name of a previously
unknown conspirator, Thomas Gates.

252
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,117
- Nichols has bought into it. See?
- Would you stop watching that.

253
00:17:26,194 --> 00:17:28,219
[Nichols continues talking]

254
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:29,627
It's on the internet!

255
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:33,901
- No stopping it now.
- Gates may have been the architect...

256
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:37,566
- They have no understanding.
- You know the truth.

257
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,938
That's all that matters.
You heard the story from Grandpa.

258
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:45,378
The story? This guy's got evidence.
He's got everything.

259
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:47,278
We have a story. We have nothing.

260
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:50,876
For one brief moment,
the Gates family could hold its head up.

261
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:54,013
- Now we're a bunch of crazies.
- But we're not liars.

262
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:57,317
Wilkinson is saying that Thomas Gates

263
00:17:57,426 --> 00:18:01,988
was a mastermind to one of
the darkest hours in U.S. history.

264
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:04,625
And he burned the diary page
to cover that up.

265
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:07,801
You and I both know he burned the page

266
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,361
to keep Booth's men
from finding the treasure.

267
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:12,236
That's what we're going to prove.

268
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:14,799
- Only one way to prove it.
- Find the treasure.

269
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:18,244
You've got to find it. You're
going to help me find it. So come on.

270
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:21,010
Let's hear the story again
from Grandpa Charles.

271
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:25,645
Grandpa heard his father say,
"Treasure map."

272
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:29,782
- Then there was a commotion.
- Got all that. Anything after that?

273
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:33,421
Anything he said,
something he did? Anything at all?

274
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:36,322
- Wait a minute.
- What?

275
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:41,597
He took his son's hand.

276
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:45,767
He looked him in the eye, and he said,
with his dying breath,

277
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:50,711
- "The debt that all men pay."
- "The debt that all men pay"?

278
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:52,908
The debt that Thomas paid.

279
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,315
That's five letters.

280
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:56,909
Oh!

281
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,146
Try "Death."

282
00:18:58,188 --> 00:18:59,951
- What?
- It's the key code.

283
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:01,854
The debt that all men pay is death.

284
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:07,654
All right.

285
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,631
[beeping]

286
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:12,567
[Riley] L-A-B-O-U-L...

287
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:15,205
It's Lab-ool...

288
00:19:15,273 --> 00:19:19,471
Lab-ahl... La...

289
00:19:19,544 --> 00:19:20,704
It's gibberish.

290
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:23,008
- Laboulaye!
- Laboulaye!

291
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,708
- What is that?
- It's a who. Édouard Laboulaye.

292
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:26,807
Where's the phone?

293
00:19:26,884 --> 00:19:29,580
I don't know.
Can't find anything in this mess.

294
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:33,647
- Temporary till I find a new place.
- Find the old one. I like her.

295
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:35,555
[indistinct chatter]

296
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,923
- Hi.
- Dr. Chase.

297
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:40,156
- Abigail, please.
- Abigail.

298
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:42,529
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.

299
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:48,164
Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.

300
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:52,040
Of course. I was actually going
to call you about the diary page.

301
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,340
- Any news?
- Well...

302
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:58,747
We actually found some
latent letter fragments on it.

303
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:02,377
Take a look.

304
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:05,955
[Wilkinson] Random letters. A cipher?

305
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:07,651
- Maybe.
- Gates seen this?

306
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:09,785
He's the one that discovered it.

307
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:10,851
[cell phone rings]

308
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:13,397
- I'm sorry.
- Not a problem.

309
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:18,496
- I need one minute.
- Please, take your time.

310
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,764
Hey. What?

311
00:20:19,838 --> 00:20:22,306
We cracked the cipher. It's "Laboulaye."

312
00:20:22,374 --> 00:20:24,103
The cipher spells "Laboulaye. "

313
00:20:24,176 --> 00:20:28,203
So? Laboulaye was well-known
in France. It could be nothing.

314
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,978
Or maybe there was a treasure map
like Thomas Gates said there was,

315
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:35,282
and Laboulaye had it.
We only got a partial on the next word.

316
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:37,516
L-A-D, lad... ladder...

317
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,251
- L-A-D.
- Aladdin! Aladdin?

318
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,725
- Lady!
- Thank you, Abigail!

319
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:45,829
Laboulaye Lady. Do you know
what Laboulaye was planning

320
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:48,527
right around the time
Lincoln was assassinated?

321
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:50,728
OK, Ben, I've got to go.

322
00:20:50,803 --> 00:20:53,271
There's a map or a clue to a map
on the Statue...

323
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:56,769
- She hung up.
- She took your call. That was good.

324
00:20:56,876 --> 00:20:59,538
- Dr. Gates?
- Yes.

325
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,783
Sounds like he cracked the cipher.
I couldn't help but overhear.

326
00:21:04,851 --> 00:21:07,911
Laboulaye? As in Édouard Laboulaye?

327
00:21:07,987 --> 00:21:10,582
He seems to believe so, yes.

328
00:21:10,658 --> 00:21:13,058
Man who had the idea
for the Statue of Liberty.

329
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:16,358
You're saying there's a treasure map
in the Statue of Liberty?

330
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,332
Laboulaye was a Mason.
They built clues into everything.

331
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:22,266
Did you learn that from my book?

332
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:27,934
- Have an interest in history?
- Fascinated by it.

333
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:31,477
Civil War, especially.
My family's descended from

334
00:21:31,545 --> 00:21:34,844
Confederate General Albert Pike.
He was a remarkable man.

335
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:39,113
But, then again, what is history but
a marker for the deeds of great men?

336
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:44,351
A man only has one lifetime,
but history can remember you forever.

337
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:47,588
So the only question is,
which Statue of Liberty?

338
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:48,754
Exactly.

339
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:51,129
Is there more than one?

340
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:54,758
There are three, actually, Riley.

341
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:59,273
One is in New York,
one in the Luxembourg Garden.

342
00:21:59,374 --> 00:22:00,842
But he only referred to one
as his "lady."

343
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:02,173
But he only referred to one
as his "lady."

344
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,724
This is like, impossible,
what you're doing.

345
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:23,423
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

346
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:27,526
[Ben] Laboulaye had to leave a clue
somewhere on here. Move in on the torch.

347
00:22:27,603 --> 00:22:30,436
[Riley] Let me get there.
It's not as easy as it looks.

348
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:32,906
No. Believe me, I understand.

349
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:35,808
[policeman speaks French]

350
00:22:36,612 --> 00:22:38,671
Excuse me, officer. May I help you?

351
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:42,015
Ah, American, eh?

352
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:43,641
Of course you see no problem

353
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:46,950
in disturbing everyone's
pleasant morning

354
00:22:47,023 --> 00:22:49,389
- with your buzzing there.
- Hey!

355
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:53,758
You know how much our constitution was
influenced by your man, Montesquieu?

356
00:22:53,829 --> 00:22:55,558
- You know Montesquieu?
- Got it.

357
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:57,826
[policeman speaks French]

358
00:22:57,933 --> 00:23:01,164
Montesquieu, yeah. "A government
should be set up so that..."

359
00:23:01,203 --> 00:23:04,331
[both] "...no man need
be afraid of another."

360
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:06,637
- That's very good.
- Thank you.

361
00:23:07,978 --> 00:23:10,469
- I'm astonished.
- I got it, I got it.

362
00:23:10,814 --> 00:23:13,612
- I hope you read French.
- May l?

363
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:14,673
[speaks French]

364
00:23:15,485 --> 00:23:16,918
He's a cop.

365
00:23:16,987 --> 00:23:22,755
Um... "Across the sea
these twins stand determined..."

366
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:25,294
- Resolute.
- "Resolute," yeah.

367
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,263
"...to preserve what we are looking for.

368
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:32,233
- Uh... Laboulaye, 1876."
- Six.

369
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:35,829
- It's a clue.
- "These twins stand resolute."

370
00:23:36,173 --> 00:23:38,835
Let's see. Resolute twins.

371
00:23:40,444 --> 00:23:41,843
Resolute.

372
00:23:42,612 --> 00:23:45,446
Resolute. And then twins.

373
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:51,154
Siamese twins? Siam? Trade routes
between France and Thailand?

374
00:23:51,856 --> 00:23:54,791
[laughs] That's ridiculous.
HMS Resolute.

375
00:23:55,727 --> 00:24:00,187
A British ship that got lost
in the Arctic in the 1800s.

376
00:24:00,298 --> 00:24:05,235
It was salvaged by American whalers, and
then Congress sent it back to England.

377
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:07,760
When the ship was finally retired,

378
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,799
Queen Victoria had two desks
made from its timbers.

379
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:15,277
Voilà. Resolute twins.

380
00:24:15,346 --> 00:24:19,680
- And where are those desks now?
- The closest one is in London.

381
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,049
How fast can we get
to Buckingham Palace?

382
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,681
Don't know. Why don't you ask
your new best friend?

383
00:24:24,757 --> 00:24:27,191
[speaking French]

384
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,783
He's going to call you a cab.

385
00:24:28,861 --> 00:24:30,385
- [speaks French]
- OK?

386
00:24:30,462 --> 00:24:34,125
- Nice helicopter. Is that yours?
- Yes, actually. It is.

387
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:38,295
- OK, so you get the ticket.
- [laughs] Great.

388
00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:42,366
Mitch Wilkinson studied history
at Virginia Military Institute.

389
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:46,309
Graduated 1978. Ran a private security
company which had contracts in Iraq

390
00:24:46,378 --> 00:24:49,176
during the invasion,
and in the Congo in the late '90s.

391
00:24:49,248 --> 00:24:53,514
These are trained mercenaries as well as
being black-market antiquities dealers.

392
00:24:54,386 --> 00:24:57,116
So why does a black market
antiquities dealer...

393
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:01,453
...give up a rare Civil War artifact?

394
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:05,760
Something he could sell to a private
collector for a good deal of money?

395
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:10,234
- [crickets chirping]
- [dog barking]

396
00:25:10,303 --> 00:25:11,429
[alarm chirps]

397
00:25:11,504 --> 00:25:13,495
[rustling]

398
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:24,576
[grunting]

399
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:48,331
[beeping]

400
00:26:09,196 --> 00:26:11,164
[Riley] So the queen's office is here.

401
00:26:11,232 --> 00:26:13,325
The elevator shaft gets you close,

402
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,234
but the only direct access
is through security.

403
00:26:17,304 --> 00:26:20,762
- That should be exciting.
- We got to get you in that room.

404
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:22,332
[phone rings]

405
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,843
- Hi, Dad.
- [Patrick] Ben.

406
00:26:23,912 --> 00:26:26,472
It's Patrick Gates' phone.
He's calling Ben.

407
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:27,606
Give me that.

408
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:31,350
The house was broken into
last night. I was attacked.

409
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:32,943
Call the police. I'm coming home.

410
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:34,852
- What?
- What good would that do?

411
00:26:34,923 --> 00:26:38,017
They didn't take anything.
And besides, I'm fine.

412
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:41,551
OK. We're in London.
We're going to Buckingham Palace.

413
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,793
We have an appointment
with the curator tomorrow afternoon.

414
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:47,096
- Son, just be careful. Goodbye.
- Bye.

415
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,033
Someone else is after the treasure.

416
00:26:49,104 --> 00:26:51,504
Of course someone else
is after the treasure.

417
00:26:51,573 --> 00:26:55,441
- It's the axiom of treasure hunting.
- We have to hurry and see that desk.

418
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,705
We don't want to miss that appointment.

419
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:02,976
- Hi. Ben Gates.
- See security. They'll let you in.

420
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:10,987
[whistling]

421
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:20,124
Wow.

422
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:45,955
OK. It's teatime, chaps.

423
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,038
Looking for the curator's office.
Which way was it again?

424
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:05,581
Follow the stairs round,
then turn first left.

425
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:07,276
Thank you so much.

426
00:28:12,155 --> 00:28:14,453
- Ben.
- Abigail.

427
00:28:14,524 --> 00:28:16,754
- What's she doing here?
- What're you doing?

428
00:28:16,827 --> 00:28:19,922
Your dad called me.
Said your next clue was here.

429
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,932
- [Riley] She's really there?
- Ben...

430
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,467
- drop her. Lose her.
- I want to help.

431
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:26,298
That's very nice,
but it's a bad time right now.

432
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,068
- A bad time, right now?
- It's a bad time.

433
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:34,771
[scoffs] OK, I just flew all the way
to London to offer my help...

434
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,246
- Remember the plan.
- You don't need it?

435
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,077
You're the one making a scene.

436
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,586
- l... I'm not making a scene right now.
- We want to make a scene.

437
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:46,282
Well then, fine! If that's what
you want, let's have it out now!

438
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:50,557
- So subtle.
- Let me guess? It's the wrong time.

439
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,495
It's the wrong place. I'm wrong again!

440
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:56,499
Wrong about us,
wrong about Thomas Gates,

441
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:59,162
wrong that you'd like
the Queen Anne chair!

442
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:01,262
You're wrong to assume
I'd like the chair.

443
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:05,208
You see? Everybody, listen to this.
This is more interesting than that.

444
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:08,769
She thinks that even when I'm right,
I'm wrong! Isn't that right?

445
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:12,715
Abigail, just because
I answer a question quickly

446
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:14,150
doesn't make it wrong.

447
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:17,916
Not if the answer's something
we need to figure out as a couple.

448
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,685
- That's what couples do!
- Sir.

449
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,749
You and your missus, take it outside.

450
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:25,888
Now look what you've done. You've
brought the little bobbies down on us!

451
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,933
You take the missus outside.
I'm staying right here.

452
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:31,535
- Ben!
- Whee!

453
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,332
- Good afternoon, sir.
- [English accent] Hello.

454
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,873
- Been drinking, have we?
- Just a nip.

455
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,968
Popped down to the pub for a pint!
Bit of all right!

456
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:41,013
Going to arrest a man for that?

457
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:44,517
Going to detain a blighter
for enjoying his whiskey?

458
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:46,176
- Enough.
- Bangers and mash.

459
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:47,879
Bubbles and squeak. Smoked eel pie.

460
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:48,978
- Sir!
- Haggis!

461
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:52,923
- That's it! Dismount the banister!
- I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts!

462
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:55,085
Here they are, standing in a row!

463
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:58,221
Small ones, big ones,
some as big as your head!

464
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,789
That was brilliant.

465
00:30:01,401 --> 00:30:05,235
- What's wrong with being right?
- Nothing. You should try it sometime.

466
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:08,365
- You're saying that I'm never right?
- I did not say that.

467
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:10,568
Hoo! So I'm wrong again.

468
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:13,744
- Now, see, there you are correct.
- Capital. Topper.

469
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:18,046
- Your mother told me about you.
- [continued arguing]

470
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:23,581
- [man] In here, please.
- Why don't you just make a list

471
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:26,820
of what's OK for me
to say or not write something...

472
00:30:27,495 --> 00:30:29,793
- What's right or wrong...
- You two, stay.

473
00:30:29,864 --> 00:30:31,832
- Right?
- No! No, no, man.

474
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:35,164
- Don't leave me in here!
- That's great. Wow.

475
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:37,202
What is going on?

476
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:41,207
I'm sorry for getting you roped
into this, but you were excellent.

477
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:44,369
- Thank you. So were you.
- When did you figure out

478
00:30:44,445 --> 00:30:47,175
- it was a fake argument?
- When'd you figure out I was

479
00:30:47,248 --> 00:30:49,910
- arguing during the fake argument?
- The middle.

480
00:30:49,984 --> 00:30:52,919
Where "l assume I'm right."
Get us out. Which I don't get.

481
00:30:52,987 --> 00:30:55,923
If I'm right, after I assume I'm right,
then I'm correct.

482
00:30:55,991 --> 00:30:58,425
When you get to a conclusion
without asking,

483
00:30:58,527 --> 00:31:01,519
and you happen to be right,
you got lucky.

484
00:31:03,098 --> 00:31:04,622
I get lucky a lot.

485
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,227
So where does that leave me, Ben?

486
00:31:07,302 --> 00:31:09,532
You guys are so great together.

487
00:31:09,604 --> 00:31:11,504
- Want to know why I'm here?
- Uh-huh.

488
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:16,943
Think there may be a clue on
the Resolute desk in the queen's study.

489
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,179
Does that help?

490
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:24,708
Don't understand why it's difficult for
you to include others in your decisions.

491
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:28,313
Just because you may know
what my answer is going to be

492
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,950
doesn't mean you don't have to ask me.

493
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:34,427
- [Riley] door number one, opening.
- [buzzing]

494
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:38,592
OK. Let me try this out.

495
00:31:39,635 --> 00:31:42,763
Abigail, would you like
to come with me, please?

496
00:31:42,838 --> 00:31:44,601
Yes. Thank you.

497
00:31:44,674 --> 00:31:46,301
Ridiculous. You're staying.

498
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,309
- It's too dangerous.
- I am so coming.

499
00:31:48,377 --> 00:31:50,937
- Door number two.
- Door two, coming up.

500
00:31:51,013 --> 00:31:52,002
[buzzing]

501
00:31:52,081 --> 00:31:53,946
- You're not coming.
- Call security.

502
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,542
[Riley] You should be near
a service elevator.

503
00:31:57,653 --> 00:31:59,848
What are you doing?
Are those for the queen?

504
00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:03,916
Queen's not here. There's
no flag flying. Queen's at Windsor.

505
00:32:03,993 --> 00:32:06,518
- What are you doing?
- See the desk, without you.

506
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:09,196
- No.
- Don't let her go.

507
00:32:09,265 --> 00:32:10,698
- Abigail...
- [clicking]

508
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:13,793
All right. Get in. Get in. Get in!

509
00:32:15,472 --> 00:32:16,734
Hold this.

510
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:25,211
Will you give me
the flowers back, please?

511
00:32:25,282 --> 00:32:26,340
Yeah.

512
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:36,119
- What?
- Wearing the perfume I bought you.

513
00:32:36,994 --> 00:32:37,983
So?

514
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:40,824
So I think it smells kind of pretty.

515
00:32:41,665 --> 00:32:44,828
- It's the flowers, Ben.
- No, it's not.

516
00:32:48,105 --> 00:32:49,572
Let's go.

517
00:32:54,545 --> 00:32:56,206
[Riley] OK, now turn left.

518
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:59,811
- Dead end.
- [Riley] I mean right. Go right.

519
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:09,224
- The flowers... petals... stamens.
- Good. Good.

520
00:33:17,235 --> 00:33:18,566
Go, go.

521
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:22,937
[Ben] That's it.

522
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:26,536
[Abigail] The Resolute desk.

523
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:29,010
We're looking for...

524
00:33:30,114 --> 00:33:34,916
...writing, patterns in the carvings.
Could be anything.

525
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:39,789
Hey, look at this.

526
00:33:42,795 --> 00:33:47,994
- "Malcolm Gilvary, 1880."
- Hold on one second.

527
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:53,227
Here we go. Malcolm Gilvary.
He didn't make furniture.

528
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:56,399
He made Chinese puzzle boxes.

529
00:34:04,316 --> 00:34:05,840
- Oh...
- What?

530
00:34:06,952 --> 00:34:11,515
I think these drawers
work like tumblers in a safe.

531
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:15,118
OK, four drawers...
Four-digit combination?

532
00:34:16,062 --> 00:34:17,154
What about a year?

533
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,963
Uh, let me see.
Queen Victoria, born 1819.

534
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:23,866
So you go one...

535
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:27,795
Eight.

536
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:33,870
One.

537
00:34:38,017 --> 00:34:39,075
Nine.

538
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,617
- Any luck?
- OK... 1876 was on the inscription

539
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:47,023
on the statue in Paris. Let's try that.

540
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,549
One.

541
00:34:50,898 --> 00:34:52,126
Eight.

542
00:34:54,702 --> 00:34:56,431
Seven.

543
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,539
Six.

544
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:30,260
[Ben] Uh-oh.

545
00:35:30,872 --> 00:35:32,066
New rules.

546
00:35:32,941 --> 00:35:36,206
These markings, like Incan or Aztec.

547
00:35:36,278 --> 00:35:38,508
I have never seen any symbols like this.

548
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:43,950
I mean, this looks centuries older
than Civil War.

549
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:45,418
What do you think it means?

550
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:49,014
I doubt it has anything to do
with the plot to assassinate Lincoln.

551
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,250
[beeping]

552
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,820
Uh-oh.

553
00:35:52,894 --> 00:35:55,192
Mayday. Mayday. Ben, get out of there.

554
00:36:00,836 --> 00:36:05,068
- Oi! Where are my detainees?
- OK, let's make some noise.

555
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:08,135
- [beeping]
- [alarm wailing]

556
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,078
The fire alarm's gone off.

557
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:13,206
Uh-oh. God save the queen.

558
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,184
[man] All units, go to action zebra.

559
00:36:16,252 --> 00:36:18,345
- What's going on?
- Haven't the foggiest.

560
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:20,855
- [indistinct chatter]
- [alarm blaring]

561
00:36:20,923 --> 00:36:24,518
Someone or something is causing this.

562
00:36:24,594 --> 00:36:27,859
- Check your primary stations.
- This doesn't make any sense.

563
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,195
Find the source terminal
and check public areas four and eight.

564
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:51,180
[man] This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much. Keep moving.

565
00:36:51,255 --> 00:36:54,884
Keep walking until you're
on the other side of the fountain.

566
00:36:54,958 --> 00:37:00,294
- Excuse me, excuse me. Coming through.
- I got them. They're at the main gate.

567
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:05,201
[siren wailing]

568
00:37:18,115 --> 00:37:21,278
- Oi! Sparkle. Come on.
- OK. Here we go.

569
00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:22,909
I'm a little bit allergic.

570
00:37:22,986 --> 00:37:25,147
- Riley.
- Thank you. OK.

571
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:28,556
- See you later. Thank you. Bye-bye.
- Sit! Sorry!

572
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:32,189
Thanks for waiting for me.
Can I see the thing?

573
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:35,097
Daniel, hold it.

574
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:38,933
What is that?

575
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:41,699
Went to Buckingham Palace,
all I got was this wood?

576
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,435
Look at the symbols.
Never seen anything like this.

577
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:46,738
It's an incredible discovery.

578
00:37:47,912 --> 00:37:51,814
- Wilkinson.
- Stop them. Go, go, go!

579
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:56,379
- He's the one after the treasure.
- I'll drive.

580
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:01,150
We're in England.

581
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,531
[Ben] It's a gun! Get down!

582
00:38:12,404 --> 00:38:16,101
- We're trapped!
- Hang on! Keep your heads down.

583
00:38:27,553 --> 00:38:28,645
Hey, who are you?

584
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:45,763
[Abigail] Sorry.

585
00:38:48,775 --> 00:38:51,005
- Hey!
- Oi!

586
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,481
- Ben, they're getting closer.
- What is their problem?

587
00:39:03,323 --> 00:39:04,756
Whoa!

588
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:08,385
- Go left! Go left!
- Hold on.

589
00:39:15,468 --> 00:39:16,765
Turn, turn!

590
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:18,760
Watch out!

591
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:26,505
Everybody OK?

592
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,846
- Come on, come on.
- Danny, I want them stopped.

593
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,586
Look out!

594
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:42,351
Ah!

595
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:52,098
Ah!

596
00:40:14,296 --> 00:40:15,627
Go. Go, go, go, go!

597
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,790
Did you see where he went?

598
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,236
[phone rings]

599
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:27,537
- What is that? Someone's phone.
- It's him.

600
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:30,840
- Have his number in your speed dial?
- Oh, shu...

601
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:33,107
This has to end
before someone gets hurt.

602
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:36,207
Give me what you got at Buckingham,
it won't be necessary.

603
00:40:36,284 --> 00:40:37,581
Tell that to my father.

604
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,382
- [man] Moron!
- [honking]

605
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:45,950
Why are they standing
in the middle of the street?

606
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:47,928
- [honking]
- [screaming]

607
00:40:48,264 --> 00:40:51,199
- Where are these people going?
- Why's everyone running?

608
00:40:54,971 --> 00:40:56,939
- He's right there! Go!
- Move!

609
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:01,409
- Get out of the way!
- [honking]

610
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:06,780
- Did I just run over a man's foot?
- [Abigail] Watch the people!

611
00:41:15,424 --> 00:41:17,051
Go! Go! Faster!

612
00:41:29,673 --> 00:41:31,538
- Right over there.
- I got them.

613
00:41:32,876 --> 00:41:35,674
- They're still behind us.
- This phone have a camera?

614
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:39,238
- No. No, it's broken.
- All right. Give me the plank.

615
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,445
Hang on.
We're going to run a red light.

616
00:41:45,522 --> 00:41:47,683
- [honking]
- Ah! Ah!

617
00:41:56,166 --> 00:42:00,125
Hack into the London Police database
and get a picture from that traffic cam.

618
00:42:00,238 --> 00:42:02,866
- Okey-dokey.
- You can't do it?

619
00:42:02,907 --> 00:42:05,774
No, I can. I just don't like
that you assume that I can.

620
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:08,404
[laughs] Why, thank you, Riley.

621
00:42:31,502 --> 00:42:32,628
Get it!

622
00:42:35,807 --> 00:42:37,001
Stop! Stop!

623
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,895
- He's got it.
- What is it?

624
00:42:59,965 --> 00:43:00,466
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.

625
00:43:00,466 --> 00:43:02,366
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.

626
00:43:10,943 --> 00:43:13,605
- Abigail!
- Hey, Patrick.

627
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,771
Nice to see you two together again.

628
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:19,045
- Yeah, well, we're not.
- Yeah.

629
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,577
Oh, I was hoping to get some
of these boxes out of the house.

630
00:43:31,698 --> 00:43:35,759
I can't read the whole thing,
but I can tell you that

631
00:43:35,835 --> 00:43:39,327
these are definitely pre-colonial
Native American markings.

632
00:43:39,406 --> 00:43:42,807
- Easily 500 years old.
- Easily.

633
00:43:46,746 --> 00:43:49,579
I can identify one symbol.

634
00:43:50,116 --> 00:43:52,710
Look at this.
Do you know what that is?

635
00:43:52,786 --> 00:43:54,754
Sacred calendrical? I don't know.

636
00:43:55,221 --> 00:43:57,782
That symbol is Cibola.

637
00:43:58,592 --> 00:43:59,718
That's Cibola.

638
00:44:01,228 --> 00:44:03,128
The City of Gold.

639
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:04,993
The City of Gold.

640
00:44:07,969 --> 00:44:11,996
[Ben] "ln 1527, a Spanish ship
wrecked on the Florida coast.

641
00:44:12,073 --> 00:44:13,938
There were only four survivors.

642
00:44:14,008 --> 00:44:19,002
One was a slave named Estebán
who saved a local tribe's dying chief.

643
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,913
As a reward,
he was taken to their sacred city,

644
00:44:21,983 --> 00:44:23,883
a city built from solid gold.

645
00:44:25,853 --> 00:44:29,914
Later, when Estebán tried to find
the city again, he never could.

646
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:35,623
But the legend grew, and every explorer
came to the New World in search of it.

647
00:44:36,564 --> 00:44:40,524
When General Custer's search for gold
ended with his last stand

648
00:44:40,602 --> 00:44:45,039
at Little Bighorn, it became clear
none would ever find it."

649
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:55,412
Ben, can you imagine if the Confederates
got their hands on the City of Gold...

650
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,618
My God.

651
00:44:58,553 --> 00:45:00,145
I'm going to go talk to her.

652
00:45:04,026 --> 00:45:06,426
- You're coming with me.
- No!

653
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:10,761
- Hey. No one else can translate it.
- There are others.

654
00:45:10,832 --> 00:45:12,197
There are several others.

655
00:45:12,267 --> 00:45:14,599
For ancient Native American?
No one better.

656
00:45:14,669 --> 00:45:17,662
- Who?
- Look, Ben, I can't go with you.

657
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:20,937
- It's been, what? Twenty-five years.
- Thirty-two.

658
00:45:22,612 --> 00:45:23,840
That long?

659
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:28,277
There's a reason
why we haven't spoken in 32 years.

660
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:31,047
- We have nothing in common.
- Me?

661
00:45:31,721 --> 00:45:35,555
Yes, of course. And I'm sure
she's just as proud of you as I am.

662
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:38,025
- Who?
- His mom.

663
00:45:40,997 --> 00:45:45,127
- Will you relax? It's gonna be fine.
- Sure. Should look at the bright side.

664
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:48,967
Been a long time. Maybe she
lost her memory, won't recognize me.

665
00:45:49,806 --> 00:45:51,205
I hate her!

666
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,733
We're in the right place.

667
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:01,044
I'm gonna take myself
out of the line of fire for this one.

668
00:46:01,118 --> 00:46:02,949
- [Ben] Hi, Mom.
- [woman] Benjamin!

669
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,183
Abigail! What a surprise!
Hello, sweetheart.

670
00:46:06,256 --> 00:46:07,245
Hi.

671
00:46:08,492 --> 00:46:09,481
Oh.

672
00:46:11,195 --> 00:46:14,687
You see? One syllable,
a knife in the heart.

673
00:46:14,765 --> 00:46:16,630
- Oh, no.
- She can do that.

674
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,567
I can also track the whereabouts
of my toothbrush.

675
00:46:19,636 --> 00:46:22,628
I was not the one that left
the toothbrushes in Marrakech.

676
00:46:22,706 --> 00:46:25,675
I stowed them both
in the travel case, as instructed.

677
00:46:25,742 --> 00:46:29,872
Yes, and you also insisted
on loading the luggage into the taxi.

678
00:46:29,947 --> 00:46:33,041
- Didn't insist. I loaded the luggage.
- Not the travel case.

679
00:46:33,117 --> 00:46:36,315
Travel case is not luggage.
The case goes into the luggage.

680
00:46:36,387 --> 00:46:39,754
- Who was in charge of packing?
- I couldn't get the case into

681
00:46:39,824 --> 00:46:42,884
the luggage. It was full
with that stupid rug you bought.

682
00:46:42,961 --> 00:46:45,054
You thought it had secret stitching.

683
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,564
- How stupid was that?
- Did have stitching.

684
00:46:47,632 --> 00:46:50,999
- Six phony green leather suitcases...
- Mom.

685
00:46:53,304 --> 00:46:55,295
I need you to take a look at this.

686
00:46:56,474 --> 00:46:58,999
- What is that a picture of?
- It's interesting.

687
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,601
- We think it might be Olmec.
- It is.

688
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:05,406
Yes, yes, definitely proto-Zoquean.

689
00:47:05,483 --> 00:47:08,646
We were hoping
that you could translate it.

690
00:47:09,387 --> 00:47:10,979
Yes, of course you were.

691
00:47:13,826 --> 00:47:17,159
Oh, this doesn't involve
another treasure hunt, does it?

692
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:20,027
Mom, this is actually very important.

693
00:47:22,001 --> 00:47:24,435
All right. What have we got here?

694
00:47:25,171 --> 00:47:29,870
This... this glyph here,
that means "bird." And that means...

695
00:47:35,814 --> 00:47:36,940
Uh, "noble bird."

696
00:47:37,016 --> 00:47:40,213
"Find the noble bird,
let him take you by the hand

697
00:47:40,286 --> 00:47:43,551
and give you passage
to the sacred temple."

698
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:48,551
[laughs]

699
00:47:50,262 --> 00:47:53,426
Oh, you think this is a treasure map
for Cibola, don't you?

700
00:47:53,967 --> 00:47:55,832
Well, that is exactly what it is.

701
00:47:55,902 --> 00:48:00,032
No, this glyph doesn't mean "Cibola."
It means "the center of the world."

702
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:04,008
You know, you used to like it. She
fell in love with me on a treasure hunt.

703
00:48:04,044 --> 00:48:07,775
That was not love. That was
excitement, adrenaline and tequila.

704
00:48:07,847 --> 00:48:09,644
- [Ben] Mom...
- I was trying to get course credit.

705
00:48:09,716 --> 00:48:13,243
Treasure hunting paid off,
in case you haven't read the papers.

706
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,481
Had nothing to do with you.
That was Ben.

707
00:48:15,555 --> 00:48:17,853
Ben found the treasure.
You did nothing.

708
00:48:17,924 --> 00:48:22,827
Patrick, Emily, please. Can we
just figure out what's on the page?

709
00:48:25,465 --> 00:48:27,126
Well, that's it, I'm afraid.

710
00:48:27,834 --> 00:48:32,033
These glyphs are only partials.
So you only have half a treasure map.

711
00:48:33,174 --> 00:48:34,436
I'm sorry.

712
00:48:35,243 --> 00:48:36,710
Not that I'm surprised.

713
00:48:38,779 --> 00:48:41,270
[Ben] At least we know
where the rest of the map is.

714
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:43,247
What?

715
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:46,083
You know where it is?
Why didn't you tell me?

716
00:48:46,153 --> 00:48:48,815
Obviously you have
a tendency to overreact!

717
00:48:52,493 --> 00:48:55,394
- I'm sorry.
- So am l.

718
00:48:55,463 --> 00:48:56,953
So where is it?

719
00:48:57,064 --> 00:49:01,660
Inscription on the statue in Paris said,
"These twins stand resolute."

720
00:49:01,702 --> 00:49:05,229
We think the map's divided
between the two Resolute desks.

721
00:49:05,306 --> 00:49:08,833
The Resolute desk.
The Resolute desk?

722
00:49:08,909 --> 00:49:10,810
President's desk?

723
00:49:11,446 --> 00:49:13,209
The president. What president?

724
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:16,217
- Our President?
- Unfortunately, yes.

725
00:49:16,285 --> 00:49:17,809
But that means...

726
00:49:17,886 --> 00:49:19,217
Wait, so we have to...

727
00:49:20,522 --> 00:49:21,682
The White House?

728
00:49:23,025 --> 00:49:26,552
The Oval Office... to be exact.

729
00:49:29,164 --> 00:49:30,961
Why would I overreact to that?

730
00:49:35,637 --> 00:49:39,471
- That's not what I signed on for.
- Could we focus on the issue at hand?

731
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:42,599
Thank you.

732
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:48,539
[Nichols] It's early, pre-Columbian.

733
00:49:48,617 --> 00:49:50,882
- Can you translate it?
- Are you kidding?

734
00:49:50,953 --> 00:49:54,252
This is an extinct,
exceedingly rare language.

735
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,122
Only a handful of people
study these languages.

736
00:49:57,193 --> 00:49:58,592
Where are we to find them?

737
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,662
Universities, I suppose.
But you don't have the whole thing.

738
00:50:02,732 --> 00:50:03,721
What do you mean?

739
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:08,028
These glyphs here... they're cut off.

740
00:50:08,104 --> 00:50:11,274
There's more to the map?
How are we going to find that?

741
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:14,209
We won't have to.
Gates will get it somehow.

742
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:18,947
The Resolute desk is near
the south wall in the Oval Office.

743
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:21,210
Look at this. Look.

744
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:23,149
Small door on the front of the desk.

745
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:26,677
[Patrick] FDR had that put in so
guests couldn't see his wheelchair.

746
00:50:26,756 --> 00:50:29,658
- But...
- Guys, take a look at this.

747
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:32,928
[Abigail] This could work.

748
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:36,727
I believe it's time for you to make
a date with your new boyfriend.

749
00:50:38,102 --> 00:50:39,262
I think you're right.

750
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:45,800
[man] We hope you're enjoying
the White House Easter Egg Roll.

751
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,972
Face painting continues at 2:00
near the south fountain.

752
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:55,009
- [Ben] That Connor in the bunny suit?
- Thank you.

753
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:58,213
I've never been to an Easter Egg Roll.
It's kind of sweet.

754
00:50:58,322 --> 00:50:59,949
Yeah, I love it.

755
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:05,690
I know you. Your great-great-grandfather
killed President Lincoln.

756
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:08,130
No. That would be John Wilkes Booth.

757
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:10,360
Eisenschiml says that Booth was a tool

758
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:13,871
in a greater conspiracy
that involved men in Lincoln's Cabinet.

759
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:16,304
Absurd.
Eisenschiml's book is filled with

760
00:51:16,374 --> 00:51:19,343
- spotty research and false assumptions.
- Oh, yeah?

761
00:51:19,411 --> 00:51:22,539
Explain why Lincoln's bodyguard
left his post that night?

762
00:51:22,614 --> 00:51:26,015
Because President Lincoln
was never accompanied by guards

763
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:29,611
when attending the theater. Listening?
Especially on Good Friday.

764
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:32,656
Explain why all the bridges
out of Washington were closed

765
00:51:32,724 --> 00:51:35,887
except one,
the one Booth needed to escape?

766
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,929
OK, run along now,
you impossible child. Run along.

767
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:43,125
What is going on
with the education in America?

768
00:51:43,201 --> 00:51:46,170
- Hey! Hey!
- Connor!

769
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:48,706
- I'm so glad you decided to come...
- Hey.

770
00:51:48,774 --> 00:51:51,334
-...with Gates.
- Connor.

771
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:53,469
- We just ran into each other.
- Oh.

772
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:59,042
Aren't you going to ask him?

773
00:51:59,118 --> 00:52:00,608
- Ask me what?
- Nothing.

774
00:52:00,686 --> 00:52:03,814
- No, really. What?
- I really wouldn't want to impose.

775
00:52:04,323 --> 00:52:09,022
Well, what she means is
she doesn't think you can.

776
00:52:09,094 --> 00:52:12,222
- Doesn't think I can what?
- She wants to see the Oval Office.

777
00:52:12,298 --> 00:52:16,166
- No. That is way too much to ask.
- No, it's, uh...

778
00:52:18,103 --> 00:52:19,365
- I can do that.
- Really?

779
00:52:19,438 --> 00:52:20,427
You see?

780
00:52:21,073 --> 00:52:22,404
- You can?
- Yeah.

781
00:52:22,475 --> 00:52:26,776
That is so cool, Connor. I have
always wanted to see the Oval Office.

782
00:52:26,847 --> 00:52:28,508
Connor rocks.

783
00:52:29,182 --> 00:52:32,208
Well... here we are.

784
00:52:32,285 --> 00:52:34,651
- Mm.
- Wow.

785
00:52:35,088 --> 00:52:39,354
Empire furnishings
and crenellated molding. Love it.

786
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:41,257
Hm.

787
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:44,229
Amazing feeling, isn't it,
standing in here?

788
00:52:44,297 --> 00:52:47,289
- Yes. Amazing, huh?
- Oh, could...

789
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:48,493
Oh. Sorry.

790
00:52:51,137 --> 00:52:54,766
Oh, that's, uh... The Resolute desk.

791
00:52:55,442 --> 00:52:58,502
Might recognize it from
the photo of young JFK Junior

792
00:52:58,612 --> 00:53:01,172
playing underneath
while his father was working.

793
00:53:01,214 --> 00:53:03,114
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.

794
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:06,085
But many people don't know

795
00:53:06,153 --> 00:53:09,611
that this desk has a twin
that sits in Buckingham Palace.

796
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,715
- Isn't that something?
- Who knew?

797
00:53:11,792 --> 00:53:14,056
Every president since
Rutherford B. Hayes

798
00:53:14,128 --> 00:53:17,063
has used that desk,
except, uh, Johnson and Nixon.

799
00:53:17,131 --> 00:53:18,598
And Ford, of course.

800
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:21,167
- Uh, no.
- Uh, yes.

801
00:53:21,235 --> 00:53:23,260
- No.
- Yes.

802
00:53:23,337 --> 00:53:26,067
Abigail! Did you lose an earring?

803
00:53:26,941 --> 00:53:29,774
Oh! I... I did, yes.

804
00:53:29,844 --> 00:53:33,109
Connor, these were given to me
by my grandmother.

805
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,980
I suppose we should look for it.
Wouldn't want anyone finding an earring

806
00:53:37,051 --> 00:53:39,986
that doesn't belong
to the first lady in the Oval Office.

807
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:41,419
- Yes.
- Excellent point,

808
00:53:41,489 --> 00:53:43,787
considering we're not
supposed to be here.

809
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:47,090
- Yeah.
- Why don't we, um, go over here

810
00:53:47,162 --> 00:53:48,493
and check it out?

811
00:53:50,265 --> 00:53:52,199
I'll check over here.

812
00:54:01,176 --> 00:54:03,736
- Do you think it fell down here?
- Yes.

813
00:54:10,352 --> 00:54:13,788
- Maybe here.
- Probably.

814
00:54:21,863 --> 00:54:23,525
Oh, no.

815
00:54:28,871 --> 00:54:32,705
- You did sit on the sofa.
- Oh, the bunnies.

816
00:54:38,081 --> 00:54:39,742
Connor!

817
00:54:39,816 --> 00:54:43,980
- You found it.
- I did.

818
00:54:53,896 --> 00:54:55,887
Thank you so much!

819
00:54:56,332 --> 00:54:57,799
Uh...

820
00:54:58,635 --> 00:55:01,433
You're just the best. Mm.

821
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:06,568
Mm!

822
00:55:12,149 --> 00:55:13,480
Mm!

823
00:55:14,284 --> 00:55:15,546
Mm!

824
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,118
- [clears throat]
- [moaning]

825
00:55:20,224 --> 00:55:21,384
[panting] Thank you.

826
00:55:24,628 --> 00:55:24,795
OK.

827
00:55:24,795 --> 00:55:25,625
OK.

828
00:55:28,198 --> 00:55:30,462
- [Ben] Empty.
- [Abigail] Someone must've taken it.

829
00:55:30,534 --> 00:55:34,129
Brightest men in our country sat
at that desk for over a hundred years.

830
00:55:34,204 --> 00:55:36,331
- Look.
- Course one of 'em found the map.

831
00:55:36,407 --> 00:55:39,899
- A symbol stamped into the wood.
- The Presidential Seal.

832
00:55:39,977 --> 00:55:41,878
It's not the Presidential Seal.

833
00:55:41,946 --> 00:55:45,609
The eagle's holding a scroll
instead of olive branches.

834
00:55:45,684 --> 00:55:48,585
- [Ben] I'm not sure what this is.
- [Patrick] What do we do?

835
00:55:48,653 --> 00:55:50,245
Did none of you read my book?

836
00:55:52,157 --> 00:55:54,421
The eagle clutching the scroll.

837
00:55:54,793 --> 00:55:56,590
- Do you know what it means?
- Yeah.

838
00:55:56,661 --> 00:55:58,788
But it's not something I could tell you.

839
00:55:59,864 --> 00:56:03,800
It's something that
I have to show you... in my book.

840
00:56:10,108 --> 00:56:13,805
- You didn't even open it?
- I was moving.

841
00:56:13,878 --> 00:56:15,436
Chapter 13.

842
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:24,518
- "The President's Secret Book"?
- "The President's Secret Book."

843
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:28,754
It happens to be a collection
of documents for presidents

844
00:56:28,828 --> 00:56:32,229
by presidents,
and for presidents' eyes only.

845
00:56:32,631 --> 00:56:36,032
And I'm not just talking about
JFK here, guys.

846
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:40,539
The 18 and a half missing minutes
of the Watergate tapes.

847
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:45,336
Did the Apollo really land
on the moon? Did it? Did it?

848
00:56:45,411 --> 00:56:49,370
And the coup de grâce... Area 51.

849
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:52,576
Come on, Riley. That's...
that's an urban legend.

850
00:56:52,651 --> 00:56:55,586
Is it, Abigail? Is it?

851
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:57,816
It's just totally...

852
00:56:57,923 --> 00:56:59,151
- Crazy?
- Yeah.

853
00:56:59,191 --> 00:57:03,993
Hm. 'Cause last time I checked,
we pretty much make our living on crazy.

854
00:57:04,064 --> 00:57:07,227
- He's got a point.
- I guess so.

855
00:57:08,835 --> 00:57:09,859
Same symbol.

856
00:57:09,936 --> 00:57:13,337
Released in '66 under
the Freedom of Information Act.

857
00:57:13,406 --> 00:57:15,135
The eagle and the scroll,

858
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:19,474
the secret symbol
in the President's Book.

859
00:57:19,546 --> 00:57:22,344
So you're saying that
whatever was on that plank

860
00:57:22,415 --> 00:57:25,316
is now in the President's Secret Book?

861
00:57:27,621 --> 00:57:29,020
[Riley] Ben.

862
00:57:29,689 --> 00:57:31,782
If it was you trying to convince me...

863
00:57:32,692 --> 00:57:36,287
...you'd have less evidence,
and I'd already believe you by now.

864
00:57:41,002 --> 00:57:42,731
The eagle with the scroll?

865
00:57:45,106 --> 00:57:47,506
Conspiracy theorists like to believe

866
00:57:47,575 --> 00:57:50,442
that it's the symbol
for the President's Secret Book.

867
00:57:50,511 --> 00:57:52,103
You bought Riley's book.

868
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,581
[laughs] Your friend writes a book
about government conspiracies.

869
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:58,118
- You don't think we know about it?
- But is it true?

870
00:57:58,219 --> 00:58:00,619
Does the President have a secret book?

871
00:58:07,528 --> 00:58:08,790
Do you like ducks?

872
00:58:10,264 --> 00:58:11,856
[quacking]

873
00:58:12,266 --> 00:58:13,460
There is a book.

874
00:58:15,002 --> 00:58:16,799
Why are you telling me out here?

875
00:58:17,973 --> 00:58:20,441
Because inside, I'm a federal agent.

876
00:58:20,509 --> 00:58:22,773
Out here,
I'm talking to you as a friend.

877
00:58:22,845 --> 00:58:27,248
- Where's the President's Book kept?
- Only the current president knows.

878
00:58:27,316 --> 00:58:29,910
The book is passed
from president to president,

879
00:58:29,985 --> 00:58:32,249
and each one chooses
his own hiding place.

880
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:34,346
You're the FBI.
Can't you get it for me?

881
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:37,984
Only way you'll ever see that book
is if you get elected president.

882
00:58:39,027 --> 00:58:40,426
Well, you never know.

883
00:58:42,297 --> 00:58:44,527
All I need is a few minutes with him.

884
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,197
A few minutes? Really?

885
00:58:47,269 --> 00:58:49,499
Even if you were married
to the President,

886
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:51,835
you wouldn't be able
to get a few minutes.

887
00:58:51,907 --> 00:58:54,899
Not when he's surrounded by handlers.
If I get him alone...

888
00:58:54,977 --> 00:58:57,276
How do you expect
to get the President alone?

889
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:00,474
Before the Civil War,
the states were all separate.

890
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:04,309
People used to say,
"The United States are."

891
00:59:04,888 --> 00:59:09,689
Wasn't until the war ended people
started saying, "The United States is."

892
00:59:11,527 --> 00:59:16,089
Under Lincoln... we became one nation.

893
00:59:16,165 --> 00:59:18,326
And Lincoln paid for it with his life.

894
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:20,892
- So did Thomas Gates.
- Right.

895
00:59:22,038 --> 00:59:23,300
With his life.

896
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:28,767
So how am I gonna get him alone?

897
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:33,744
I'm gonna kidnap him.

898
00:59:35,385 --> 00:59:38,378
I'm gonna kidnap
the President of the United States.

899
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:41,984
[laughs]

900
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:44,152
- That's not funny.
- I'm your father.

901
00:59:44,228 --> 00:59:47,459
How do you expect me to respond?
I can't let you ruin your life.

902
00:59:47,531 --> 00:59:49,522
Are you out of your mind?

903
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,660
Read my book, and you'd know
you can't get to that book.

904
00:59:52,736 --> 00:59:55,136
Exactly how do you plan on doing this?

905
00:59:56,473 --> 00:59:58,175
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

906
00:59:58,175 --> 00:59:59,369
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

907
00:59:59,443 --> 01:00:01,638
- What?
- I'm in.

908
01:00:01,812 --> 01:00:04,576
[man] Sir, we have to move the party.

909
01:00:04,715 --> 01:00:07,548
Some historian claims
the Spencer Landmark Hotel

910
01:00:07,618 --> 01:00:10,109
was used for Klan meetings
in the late 1800s.

911
01:00:10,187 --> 01:00:13,645
- Anyone know if this is true?
- I've got the Washington Gazette.

912
01:00:13,724 --> 01:00:17,821
They want a quote on, "Is the President
being insensitive to minority issues?"

913
01:00:17,896 --> 01:00:21,024
- Doesn't matter.
- Get a list of approved alternates.

914
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:23,761
- What do you have?
- Yeah, I know it's short notice.

915
01:00:23,835 --> 01:00:27,532
The pipe burst in the hotel
that we previously booked.

916
01:00:27,605 --> 01:00:32,633
- l... There is water everywhere.
- A retirement party for 200 people.

917
01:00:32,711 --> 01:00:35,475
- Gunston Hall.
- Monticello is booked.

918
01:00:35,547 --> 01:00:37,811
So is Gunston Hall and Tudor Place.

919
01:00:37,882 --> 01:00:41,249
The Denby Hotel is available,
and so is Mount Vernon.

920
01:00:41,319 --> 01:00:45,483
- Oh, wow. You are a lifesaver.
- The Denby is great.

921
01:00:45,557 --> 01:00:48,754
Strike that. The Denby was booked.
Mount Vernon's all we got.

922
01:00:48,827 --> 01:00:51,022
Book it before someone else does.

923
01:00:52,564 --> 01:00:55,659
[cheering, applause]

924
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,329
And let me say
what an honor it is to be here

925
01:00:58,437 --> 01:01:00,735
and add my happy birthday to you,
Mr. President.

926
01:01:00,773 --> 01:01:04,334
[Randy Travis:
Better Class of Losers]

927
01:01:06,312 --> 01:01:09,372
[singing]

928
01:01:23,362 --> 01:01:26,661
[siren wails]

929
01:01:31,003 --> 01:01:33,062
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

930
01:01:33,139 --> 01:01:35,802
Are you aware that you are
in a restricted area?

931
01:01:35,876 --> 01:01:38,401
Yeah, but this is
where the fish are, son.

932
01:01:38,478 --> 01:01:41,914
That may be, but I'm gonna
need to have you move upriver.

933
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:50,120
Are you aware that according
to article one, section 25

934
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:53,785
of the Maryland constitution,
I'm allowed to fish in public water?

935
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:58,729
Are you aware I have the right to detain
you for the next 48 hours without cause?

936
01:01:59,433 --> 01:02:03,870
I am going to go back where
I came from just as fast as possible.

937
01:02:11,278 --> 01:02:14,976
Maybe one day I'll wear this thing
to a party I was actually invited to.

938
01:02:15,049 --> 01:02:18,780
[Randy Travis: Is It Still Over]

939
01:02:18,853 --> 01:02:21,947
[singing]

940
01:02:24,759 --> 01:02:27,660
Twenty hundred time check. Station 11.

941
01:02:27,728 --> 01:02:30,288
- [man] All clear. Perimeter secure.
- Hey.

942
01:02:30,364 --> 01:02:33,697
You didn't happen to see
a cute brunette wandering around?

943
01:02:33,768 --> 01:02:36,862
- Went to get a drink, she disappeared.
- No, sir.

944
01:02:37,605 --> 01:02:39,095
I've got no game tonight.

945
01:02:45,913 --> 01:02:50,009
Good evening, Your Excellency. Hello.

946
01:02:50,084 --> 01:02:54,112
Prime Minister, it's a delight
to have you back in the States.

947
01:02:54,189 --> 01:02:58,319
Spread the word, contribution limits
not enforced on the President's birth...

948
01:02:58,427 --> 01:02:59,985
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

949
01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:03,759
- Ben Gates. The Templar treasure?
- Oh, right, Ben Gates. Yeah.

950
01:03:03,832 --> 01:03:07,097
- We won't keep you.
- Thanks so much. Always a pleasure.

951
01:03:07,169 --> 01:03:11,503
I can't tell you what a thrill it is
for me to be invited here tonight, sir.

952
01:03:11,573 --> 01:03:15,441
Yeah, you must have
the Secret Service hopping about now.

953
01:03:15,511 --> 01:03:16,842
Sir?

954
01:03:16,912 --> 01:03:18,971
Considering your discovered lineage.

955
01:03:19,047 --> 01:03:21,572
- Oh, yeah. Oh, that...
- Carry on.

956
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:24,847
I beg your pardon, sir,
but I know what a huge admirer you are

957
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:28,913
of George Washington. I thought
you might want to take a look at this.

958
01:03:28,991 --> 01:03:30,549
Have a look at that.

959
01:03:30,626 --> 01:03:34,222
This is a map of Mount Vernon
drawn by George Washington himself.

960
01:03:34,297 --> 01:03:37,164
Mr. President,
that is exactly what it is.

961
01:03:37,233 --> 01:03:40,999
- Architectural history major, Yale.
- I did not know that.

962
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,867
It belonged to my great uncle.

963
01:03:42,939 --> 01:03:45,066
Got it from the granddaughter
of a slave, Charlotte.

964
01:03:45,141 --> 01:03:48,440
- Happy birthday.
- Always a pleasure. Thank you so much.

965
01:03:48,511 --> 01:03:52,072
Charlotte, who lived here
and worked here at Mount Vernon.

966
01:03:52,148 --> 01:03:55,515
- Yeah.
- And we're standing right here, sir.

967
01:03:55,585 --> 01:03:59,851
This line is an underground tunnel,
an escape route that was never found.

968
01:03:59,956 --> 01:04:03,585
I wonder...
I wonder if it's still there.

969
01:04:04,594 --> 01:04:06,755
- Well...
- [laughs]

970
01:04:06,829 --> 01:04:10,527
- Only one way to find out, sir.
- Maybe we should take a look.

971
01:04:11,302 --> 01:04:12,826
Are we allowed to do that?

972
01:04:13,204 --> 01:04:16,605
I mean, I know you're allowed
to do that. You're the President.

973
01:04:16,674 --> 01:04:17,936
Can I come with you?

974
01:04:19,543 --> 01:04:22,239
- You guys are just everywhere.
- Yes, sir.

975
01:04:22,313 --> 01:04:24,838
- Give my friend your flashlight.
- Thank you.

976
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:28,714
According to this map, it should be...

977
01:04:29,787 --> 01:04:33,780
It's one... two. In here.

978
01:04:33,857 --> 01:04:35,484
Yeah, should be in here.

979
01:04:37,261 --> 01:04:38,523
- May l?
- Absolutely.

980
01:04:38,596 --> 01:04:40,086
All right.

981
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:46,903
You know, Craig,
I appreciate you doing your job,

982
01:04:46,971 --> 01:04:48,963
but I have no enemies down here.

983
01:04:49,774 --> 01:04:52,800
In the cellar. In this tiny little room.

984
01:04:54,112 --> 01:04:55,579
I'll just wait here, then.

985
01:05:06,524 --> 01:05:08,048
[Ben] Over here.

986
01:05:11,463 --> 01:05:15,331
- That's the mark of George Washington.
- Only it's slightly different.

987
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,961
- How?
- These axes, the angle's off.

988
01:05:19,904 --> 01:05:25,740
For it to correspond with the ones on
the map, it should form a perfect V.

989
01:05:26,611 --> 01:05:28,102
[clanking]

990
01:05:31,951 --> 01:05:33,145
OK, what else?

991
01:05:34,086 --> 01:05:35,986
The arrowhead...

992
01:05:38,491 --> 01:05:40,254
...is sideways.

993
01:05:45,031 --> 01:05:46,020
[rumbling]

994
01:05:46,098 --> 01:05:47,929
[gasps]

995
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,059
[President] We're all right.
Don't worry.

996
01:05:55,474 --> 01:05:56,771
Look at that.

997
01:05:57,576 --> 01:05:58,565
Come on.

998
01:06:04,817 --> 01:06:05,806
Mr. President?

999
01:06:07,387 --> 01:06:09,947
We have a breach
in zone nine! There's...

1000
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:16,359
- Inform Fairfax, SecTac Channel One!
- Perimeter detail, lock down all exits!

1001
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:19,999
- Gates, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1002
01:06:20,067 --> 01:06:23,798
I need to ask you a question,
which I know you can't answer

1003
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:26,668
- unless we're alone.
- Two coming in!

1004
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:30,933
I want a sledgehammer, I want a crowbar,
I want a jackhammer, now!

1005
01:06:32,479 --> 01:06:34,470
Tom, alert the Vice President.

1006
01:06:35,682 --> 01:06:38,276
Mr. President, sometime between 1880,

1007
01:06:38,352 --> 01:06:41,446
when the Resolute desk
was placed in the Oval Office,

1008
01:06:41,521 --> 01:06:46,015
and now, one of our presidents found
a secret compartment in the desk.

1009
01:06:46,093 --> 01:06:49,860
Hidden inside was a plank
with Native American writing on it.

1010
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:54,698
A treasure map to Cibola,
the legendary City of Gold, sir.

1011
01:06:54,769 --> 01:06:57,101
All this just to ask me
about a treasure map?

1012
01:06:57,205 --> 01:07:00,572
That map is a key to proving
Thomas Gates' innocence.

1013
01:07:00,608 --> 01:07:04,874
I know for a fact that the plank
is no longer in the Resolute desk.

1014
01:07:04,946 --> 01:07:06,470
You've been in my desk too?

1015
01:07:06,547 --> 01:07:09,607
I believe the whereabouts
of that plank is now hidden...

1016
01:07:10,451 --> 01:07:12,476
...in the President's Book, sir.

1017
01:07:15,423 --> 01:07:17,482
The book known only to our presidents.

1018
01:07:18,593 --> 01:07:21,084
It contains all of our nation's secrets.

1019
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:23,688
[laughs]

1020
01:07:25,901 --> 01:07:28,631
That's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

1021
01:07:28,704 --> 01:07:34,574
I saw the seal in the desk, sir.
I know the map exists.

1022
01:07:36,145 --> 01:07:38,636
You're not going to tell me
how to get out of here

1023
01:07:38,714 --> 01:07:42,081
- unless you get what you want.
- The way out is that direction,

1024
01:07:42,151 --> 01:07:43,982
and I'll show you.

1025
01:07:44,052 --> 01:07:46,111
You don't negotiate very well, do you?

1026
01:07:47,156 --> 01:07:48,384
No, sir.

1027
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:50,184
Mr. President!

1028
01:07:50,259 --> 01:07:51,954
Where are my sledgehammers?

1029
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:59,095
I don't get you, Gates.

1030
01:07:59,234 --> 01:08:01,998
You do all this,
you're willing to go to prison,

1031
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:04,368
just to clear your ancestor's name.

1032
01:08:05,074 --> 01:08:07,508
The way out is just down those stairs.

1033
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:11,680
Everything I am
is because of my ancestors, sir.

1034
01:08:12,482 --> 01:08:15,246
Thomas Gates gave his
last full measure of devotion

1035
01:08:15,318 --> 01:08:17,912
to his country to stop the KGC.

1036
01:08:17,987 --> 01:08:21,787
When someone dies for their country,
I believe they should be honored.

1037
01:08:21,858 --> 01:08:23,723
"Last full measure of devotion"?

1038
01:08:24,394 --> 01:08:27,261
Lincoln is my favorite president, sir.
No offense.

1039
01:08:28,498 --> 01:08:31,831
None taken. He's my favorite too.

1040
01:08:33,636 --> 01:08:36,833
Sir, I know the book exists,
and my question is,

1041
01:08:36,906 --> 01:08:40,273
"Will you agree to let me see it?"

1042
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:43,607
Even if something like that
really did exist,

1043
01:08:43,681 --> 01:08:46,582
why do you think I would
actually just give it to you?

1044
01:08:47,184 --> 01:08:49,049
Because it will probably lead us

1045
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:53,215
to the discovery of the greatest
Native American treasure of all time.

1046
01:08:53,858 --> 01:08:56,850
A huge piece of culture lost.

1047
01:08:56,961 --> 01:09:00,021
You can give that history
back to its descendants.

1048
01:09:00,064 --> 01:09:04,262
And because you're the President
of the United States, sir.

1049
01:09:04,335 --> 01:09:09,204
Whether by innate character, or the oath
you took to defend the Constitution,

1050
01:09:09,273 --> 01:09:12,174
or the weight of history
that falls upon you.

1051
01:09:12,843 --> 01:09:15,778
I believe you
to be an honorable man, sir.

1052
01:09:17,815 --> 01:09:20,181
People don't believe that stuff anymore.

1053
01:09:22,186 --> 01:09:23,711
They want to believe it.

1054
01:09:27,158 --> 01:09:30,787
[grunting]

1055
01:09:43,008 --> 01:09:45,841
[owl hooting]

1056
01:09:45,911 --> 01:09:50,746
Nearest highway is that direction.
You'll understand if we part ways here.

1057
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:58,120
- Gates.
- Sir?

1058
01:09:58,189 --> 01:10:01,249
The following conversation
never happened.

1059
01:10:02,628 --> 01:10:04,095
The book exists.

1060
01:10:05,264 --> 01:10:07,698
- Where is it?
- Where else do you keep a book?

1061
01:10:07,767 --> 01:10:09,598
In the Library of Congress.

1062
01:10:10,336 --> 01:10:15,035
X, Y, two, three, four,
seven, eight, six.

1063
01:10:15,374 --> 01:10:16,398
Thank you, sir.

1064
01:10:17,376 --> 01:10:22,279
You'll also need to know
three, seven, nine, four.

1065
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:23,645
Got it.

1066
01:10:24,717 --> 01:10:28,346
- And, Gates...
- Sir?

1067
01:10:28,888 --> 01:10:33,723
Two hundred people know you held me
against my will. I can't tell them why.

1068
01:10:33,793 --> 01:10:36,125
Unless you find what you're looking for,

1069
01:10:36,195 --> 01:10:38,993
you'll be charged
with kidnapping the President.

1070
01:10:39,065 --> 01:10:43,435
- You know what that means.
- Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.

1071
01:10:47,307 --> 01:10:50,970
- I want you to do something for me.
- It would be a privilege, sir.

1072
01:10:51,845 --> 01:10:55,872
Page 47. Just have a look at that.

1073
01:10:57,351 --> 01:10:59,046
[dialing phone]

1074
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:02,316
Riley, meet me at the
Library of Congress in 20 minutes.

1075
01:11:05,025 --> 01:11:06,014
OK.

1076
01:11:09,463 --> 01:11:11,260
[phone rings]

1077
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,289
Sadusky.

1078
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:19,839
The President's been... what?

1079
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:23,199
Gates.

1080
01:11:28,282 --> 01:11:30,807
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1081
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:35,288
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1082
01:11:35,356 --> 01:11:36,983
- Hey.
- Hey.

1083
01:11:37,392 --> 01:11:38,757
We're close.

1084
01:11:48,836 --> 01:11:52,328
- Where do we start?
- XY is the book classification code.

1085
01:11:52,407 --> 01:11:55,899
Stands for special collections,
which means very special books.

1086
01:11:55,977 --> 01:11:58,946
- Where are they?
- This way. We'll sneak in.

1087
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:22,893
This will be good.

1088
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,332
Here we go. XA... XM...

1089
01:12:34,316 --> 01:12:36,784
Look. Do you have a code?

1090
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:39,919
Three-seven-nine-four.

1091
01:12:46,663 --> 01:12:48,961
What did the President say
the number was?

1092
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:51,227
Two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1093
01:12:59,309 --> 01:13:01,334
Two-three-six-seven...

1094
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:04,471
X-Y-two-three-three,
two-three-seven-eight... Here.

1095
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:06,208
Two-three-four-seven-nine-one.

1096
01:13:06,349 --> 01:13:09,182
- Two-three-four-seven-nine...
- Seventy-six, seventy-eight...

1097
01:13:09,252 --> 01:13:10,549
It's not there.

1098
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:15,151
[Riley] Maybe someone checked it out.

1099
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:20,958
- Why send us here if there's no book?
- He probably wanted us to get caught.

1100
01:13:21,031 --> 01:13:23,499
- [siren wailing]
- [tires squealing]

1101
01:13:30,775 --> 01:13:31,764
Here.

1102
01:13:48,325 --> 01:13:51,192
- What is that?
- It's a six-dial combination lock.

1103
01:13:53,264 --> 01:13:55,164
The location is the combination.

1104
01:13:56,501 --> 01:13:58,298
The location is the combination.

1105
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,947
[laughs]

1106
01:14:15,453 --> 01:14:17,421
[Riley] Yes. I was right.

1107
01:14:18,323 --> 01:14:19,722
Well done, Mr. Poole.

1108
01:14:26,898 --> 01:14:28,490
Eagle and the scroll.

1109
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,804
- Area 51!
- Shh!

1110
01:14:45,952 --> 01:14:48,443
- Kennedy assassination.
- Shh! We don't have time.

1111
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:50,546
Yeah, it's true. [clears throat]

1112
01:14:50,623 --> 01:14:53,490
[sirens wailing]

1113
01:14:53,559 --> 01:14:56,221
Here. Wait.

1114
01:14:56,295 --> 01:15:00,459
"April 1865. Queen Victoria
sends Pike two coded missives.

1115
01:15:00,566 --> 01:15:05,003
The first is received.
Contains information regarding

1116
01:15:05,037 --> 01:15:08,473
New World treasure. The City of Gold."

1117
01:15:09,075 --> 01:15:12,442
Wait. The queen
wanted to help the Confederacy?

1118
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:16,141
- A divided America'd have been weaker.
- Needed cotton from the South.

1119
01:15:16,216 --> 01:15:19,379
"The second missive was thought
to contain a Playfair cipher

1120
01:15:19,453 --> 01:15:23,389
suggesting contact with Laboulaye,
who'll hide clues before his death."

1121
01:15:23,457 --> 01:15:27,188
The cipher written into the Booth
diary page that Thomas tried to burn.

1122
01:15:27,261 --> 01:15:29,559
- The one we have.
- Exactly. "1880.

1123
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:34,528
Resolute desk arrives in Washington,
sent by queen to President Hayes."

1124
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:37,559
Look at that.

1125
01:15:39,339 --> 01:15:42,604
Missing plank from the White House. Wow.

1126
01:15:44,578 --> 01:15:47,138
Here's the final entry
by President Coolidge.

1127
01:15:47,214 --> 01:15:51,275
"1924. I found a plank
in secret desk compartment.

1128
01:15:51,351 --> 01:15:55,049
Plank photographed and then destroyed.

1129
01:15:55,123 --> 01:15:57,921
Borglum commissioned
to destroy landmarks

1130
01:15:58,026 --> 01:16:00,119
in sacred Black Hills mountains."

1131
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:06,359
Borglum. Mount Rushmore?

1132
01:16:07,035 --> 01:16:12,029
He carved Mount Rushmore
to erase the map's landmarks

1133
01:16:12,106 --> 01:16:14,574
in order to protect the City of Gold.

1134
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:18,238
Mount Rushmore was a cover-up.

1135
01:16:18,313 --> 01:16:21,077
- [police siren blares]
- What is it?

1136
01:16:22,650 --> 01:16:26,051
There's my tax dollars at work,
coming to arrest me.

1137
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,748
Not coming for you,
they're for me. Go to the car.

1138
01:16:28,823 --> 01:16:30,723
- No!
- Go! I'll meet up with you.

1139
01:16:31,292 --> 01:16:32,281
This way.

1140
01:16:33,362 --> 01:16:34,386
[clicks]

1141
01:16:39,635 --> 01:16:41,068
[indistinct chattering]

1142
01:16:41,136 --> 01:16:43,536
So Gates abducts the President,
lets him go

1143
01:16:43,605 --> 01:16:45,596
and heads to the Library of Congress?

1144
01:16:45,674 --> 01:16:48,302
- Why?
- Maybe he wants to check out a book.

1145
01:16:50,713 --> 01:16:52,180
[clicks]

1146
01:16:52,247 --> 01:16:53,942

[man on police radio] All agents...

[dialing phone]

1151
01:17:45,368 --> 01:17:47,199
- Dad.
- Ben.

1152
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:49,534
Get out of there.
I had to move the car.

1153
01:17:49,606 --> 01:17:52,007
FBI, Secret Service all over the place.

1154
01:17:52,076 --> 01:17:54,840
Calm down. I sent a picture
of the plank to your cell.

1155
01:17:54,912 --> 01:17:56,846
- You can do that?
- Yes, I can do that.

1156
01:17:56,947 --> 01:17:58,574
did you get it?

1157
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,714
- I got it.
- [Ben] Look.

1158
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:06,481
- Take it to Mom for translation.
- Why me?

1159
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,616
He say his mom
could translate the plank?

1160
01:18:08,692 --> 01:18:10,592
Find out who she is.

1161
01:18:21,806 --> 01:18:24,536
- How are we going to find Ben?
- I don't know.

1162
01:18:24,608 --> 01:18:26,508
- Hold it! Who are you?
- We work here.

1163
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:28,772
- IDs.
- Here. We were told to evacuate.

1164
01:18:28,846 --> 01:18:30,542
[Riley] I don't know what's going on.

1165
01:18:30,615 --> 01:18:33,209
- My car's parked...
- One second I'm reading...

1166
01:18:33,285 --> 01:18:36,777
- Special section for...
-...a book, then we're rushed out...

1167
01:18:36,855 --> 01:18:38,413
- Go ahead.
- OK. Thank you.

1168
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:41,584
- Thank you for your help, officer.
- Best of luck.

1169
01:18:42,094 --> 01:18:44,892
- [alarm chirps]
- Have a good night.

1170
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,731
[man] Hey, go
to the northeast sectors...

1171
01:18:55,207 --> 01:18:56,538
[Riley] Start the car.

1172
01:18:57,209 --> 01:18:59,541
[engine starts]

1173
01:18:59,611 --> 01:19:00,771
Put it in gear.

1174
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:04,715
- Uh-oh.
- What's the problem?

1175
01:19:04,783 --> 01:19:05,909
It's clear. Let's go!

1176
01:19:06,518 --> 01:19:07,815
We're going to jail.

1177
01:19:10,923 --> 01:19:12,686
[man] I want to run a check...

1178
01:19:13,059 --> 01:19:14,151
[grunts]

1179
01:19:15,595 --> 01:19:16,892
Get in! Hang on!

1180
01:19:18,498 --> 01:19:19,726
Mercedes SUV...

1181
01:19:19,799 --> 01:19:22,359
- He's in! Go!
- Hang on!

1182
01:19:22,435 --> 01:19:24,062
[Abigail] Whoa!

1183
01:19:25,338 --> 01:19:26,430
OK. We can do this.

1184
01:19:30,643 --> 01:19:32,770
Close the barricade, lock it down!

1185
01:19:32,845 --> 01:19:34,938
Lock it down!

1186
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:39,481
- Drive, drive, drive!
- OK.

1187
01:19:41,654 --> 01:19:43,315
I don't think so!

1188
01:19:44,023 --> 01:19:45,251
Whoa, whoa!

1189
01:19:49,696 --> 01:19:52,028
[man] Go, go, go, go, go!

1190
01:19:52,099 --> 01:19:54,363
Let's go! Let's go!

1191
01:19:54,434 --> 01:19:56,231
[engine hissing]

1192
01:19:56,937 --> 01:19:59,428
That did not turn out
the way it was supposed to!

1193
01:19:59,506 --> 01:20:02,168
- How'd they find us so quick?
- I'll tell you how.

1194
01:20:02,242 --> 01:20:05,905
- The President is a tattletale!
- Sadusky. He was there.

1195
01:20:05,979 --> 01:20:08,311
He knows more about the book
than I thought.

1196
01:20:08,382 --> 01:20:10,983
How'd the President
feel about being kidnapped?

1197
01:20:11,652 --> 01:20:12,744
He was OK.

1198
01:20:19,161 --> 01:20:22,096
- Dr. Appleton.
- This office is closed. I'm sorry.

1199
01:20:22,164 --> 01:20:24,632
I do apologize
for the lateness of the hour.

1200
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:28,197
My name is Mitch Wilkinson.

1201
01:20:28,271 --> 01:20:31,900
I've got something I want you
to take a look at. Just take a minute.

1202
01:20:39,682 --> 01:20:41,980
- You're a treasure hunter.
- No, ma'am.

1203
01:20:42,051 --> 01:20:44,815
I'm just a man trying
to make his mark on history.

1204
01:20:45,355 --> 01:20:46,686
Can you help me?

1205
01:20:48,091 --> 01:20:52,357
Um... No, I don't know that language.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

1206
01:20:52,462 --> 01:20:54,987
- [phone rings]
- Oh, excuse me.

1207
01:20:58,134 --> 01:20:59,226
Yes.

1208
01:21:00,837 --> 01:21:02,304
Got it.

1209
01:21:02,906 --> 01:21:06,673
Your ex-husband's on his way up.
He wants the translation.

1210
01:21:08,112 --> 01:21:13,277
Tell him anything but the truth.
Get rid of him. His life depends on it.

1211
01:21:22,927 --> 01:21:24,485
Emily?

1212
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:39,438
I know I'm the last person
you want to see,

1213
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:44,777
and I'm not comfortable either,
but we need you to translate something.

1214
01:21:46,551 --> 01:21:50,783
- Ben sent me. He needs your help.
- Yes, of course.

1215
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:54,081
If it's for Ben, of course. What is it?

1216
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,492
Oh. Uh...

1217
01:21:57,562 --> 01:22:00,326
It's in the cell phone.
I'm not sure how to...

1218
01:22:00,398 --> 01:22:02,389
- Give it to me.
-...bring it out.

1219
01:22:05,604 --> 01:22:07,401
[beeping]

1220
01:22:10,275 --> 01:22:12,675
We know it leads to Mount Rushmore.

1221
01:22:16,748 --> 01:22:19,945
Yes. "Islands...
Islands of stone in a sea of grass."

1222
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:24,648
That's what the Lakota used to call
the Black Hills in South Dakota.

1223
01:22:25,358 --> 01:22:26,347
Right.

1224
01:22:29,629 --> 01:22:34,032
"Find where the moon touches the earth
and release the hummingbird."

1225
01:22:38,604 --> 01:22:39,662
That's it?

1226
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:51,614
Did it ever occur to you...?
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1227
01:22:52,818 --> 01:22:56,754
Did it ever occur to you that I did
the things I did to impress you?

1228
01:22:59,525 --> 01:23:03,393
No, you did it because you wanted to,
and I would've done the same thing,

1229
01:23:03,462 --> 01:23:06,796
except one of us had to grow up
and stay home and look after Ben.

1230
01:23:06,867 --> 01:23:08,858
Certainly wasn't going to be you.

1231
01:23:09,736 --> 01:23:14,196
Did it ever occur to you that I made
sacrifices for us that you never did?

1232
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:18,368
No, of course not.

1233
01:23:18,845 --> 01:23:20,676
So just go away.

1234
01:23:34,761 --> 01:23:36,251
Lousy tequila.

1235
01:23:40,834 --> 01:23:43,065
Don't feel bad. You did good.

1236
01:23:43,137 --> 01:23:45,196
Patrick believed every word you said.

1237
01:23:45,273 --> 01:23:48,834
Besides, your son would have
never found the treasure anyway.

1238
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:50,741
You don't know Benjamin.

1239
01:23:50,812 --> 01:23:54,373
Perhaps not.
But then again, I have this.

1240
01:23:58,019 --> 01:24:02,888
A letter from Queen Victoria to
the Confederate General Albert Pike?

1241
01:24:02,957 --> 01:24:07,223
Seems the dear old queen
was partial to the Confederate cause.

1242
01:24:07,929 --> 01:24:10,864
This has been handed down
by my family for 140 years.

1243
01:24:11,699 --> 01:24:15,999
Contains a vital piece of information.
The final clue, as it were.

1244
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:21,940
This piece of information is worthless
without your translation of the planks.

1245
01:24:23,445 --> 01:24:25,208
It's ironic, isn't it?

1246
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:30,047
This all began with the burning
of pages, and now it ends

1247
01:24:30,119 --> 01:24:33,646
with the burning of this,
the final clue.

1248
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:36,219
Making me the only one...

1249
01:24:37,426 --> 01:24:38,127
...who can find Cibola.

1250
01:24:38,127 --> 01:24:38,923
...who can find Cibola.

1251
01:24:41,196 --> 01:24:42,254
Get your coat.

1252
01:24:55,144 --> 01:24:58,136
Her translation on the second half
of the planks says

1253
01:24:58,213 --> 01:25:01,775
- we need to find an island of stone.
- Ben would have found it by now.

1254
01:25:02,185 --> 01:25:03,447
I don't think so.

1255
01:25:09,993 --> 01:25:11,187
[whistles]

1256
01:25:11,261 --> 01:25:13,092
How do I get to, um, this...

1257
01:25:14,964 --> 01:25:16,192
Hello, Mitch.

1258
01:25:17,867 --> 01:25:18,925
Mom...

1259
01:25:19,002 --> 01:25:21,869
- Wait for me.
- No way. You're too slow.

1260
01:25:22,205 --> 01:25:25,197
I knew you'd figure out
the message I gave your father.

1261
01:25:25,608 --> 01:25:28,577
The hummingbird was good. Let her go.

1262
01:25:28,645 --> 01:25:32,376
We're the ones with the firepower,
and you're giving me orders.

1263
01:25:32,449 --> 01:25:36,715
I kidnapped the President. The FBI
is on their way right now to arrest me,

1264
01:25:36,786 --> 01:25:38,811
and I'm sure they'll love to meet you.

1265
01:25:38,888 --> 01:25:41,016
They'll find us both and arrest us both.

1266
01:25:41,092 --> 01:25:43,822
That path doesn't lead
to the City of Gold, does it?

1267
01:25:44,061 --> 01:25:46,962
This man has information you need.
He's got a letter.

1268
01:25:47,031 --> 01:25:49,397
From Queen Victoria
to General Albert Pike.

1269
01:25:49,467 --> 01:25:52,334
- How do you know that?
- I read about it, in a book.

1270
01:25:55,406 --> 01:25:56,873
I'm afraid he's burned it.

1271
01:26:00,177 --> 01:26:04,876
All right... You've had me do
all the work so far, why stop now?

1272
01:26:05,516 --> 01:26:08,849
You tell me what you know,
I'll find the City of Gold,

1273
01:26:08,919 --> 01:26:12,150
prove Thomas Gates' innocence,
you can have the treasure.

1274
01:26:12,223 --> 01:26:14,123
- What?
- I'm going with you.

1275
01:26:14,191 --> 01:26:17,957
But if anyone's gonna be credited
for discovering the City of Gold,

1276
01:26:18,028 --> 01:26:19,290
it's going to be me.

1277
01:26:19,363 --> 01:26:22,458
But your partners stay here,
and all the guns.

1278
01:26:22,534 --> 01:26:24,195
What makes you think I'd agree?

1279
01:26:25,103 --> 01:26:29,631
Because you need that treasure.
Believe me, I know.

1280
01:26:34,212 --> 01:26:36,442
All right, Gates. We'll do it your way.

1281
01:26:39,351 --> 01:26:43,219
But believe me... I don't need the guns.

1282
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:51,960
- Which president? The President?
- I thought it best not to tell you.

1283
01:27:05,278 --> 01:27:08,941
[Abigail] I still don't see anything
that looks like a noble bird.

1284
01:27:10,883 --> 01:27:12,851
All right. Let's have it.

1285
01:27:12,919 --> 01:27:17,356
What did the letter say? What's
the clue from Queen Victoria's letter?

1286
01:27:17,423 --> 01:27:22,725
"The entrance shall only be revealed
under a cloudless rain."

1287
01:27:22,795 --> 01:27:24,387
Figure that one out.

1288
01:27:24,463 --> 01:27:28,092
So we come back when it's raining?

1289
01:27:30,102 --> 01:27:33,936
"Cloudless." Could simply mean the sun.

1290
01:27:34,607 --> 01:27:37,599
You need a sunny day... and rain.

1291
01:27:38,979 --> 01:27:39,968
We need water.

1292
01:27:40,714 --> 01:27:41,874
Water.

1293
01:27:52,526 --> 01:27:53,652
Abigail.

1294
01:27:54,828 --> 01:27:58,264
Everybody, the water makes
the rocks darker. Use the water.

1295
01:27:58,332 --> 01:27:59,560
Em? Water?

1296
01:27:59,633 --> 01:28:03,729
- What's this in my hand? Are you blind?
- Good, good, good.

1297
01:28:15,782 --> 01:28:19,014
This is ridiculous.
Are we going to water the whole thing?

1298
01:28:28,663 --> 01:28:30,130
That's it.

1299
01:28:30,198 --> 01:28:34,794
Oh! That's it. I found it.
Over here! Found it! Over here!

1300
01:28:37,005 --> 01:28:38,131
Look at this!

1301
01:28:39,674 --> 01:28:40,732
It's an eagle.

1302
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:45,338
- Look at that. It's an eagle.
- There it is.

1303
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:48,578
- "The noble bird..."
- "Will give you passage."

1304
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:52,142
- Uh-huh. Now what?
- We need to join hands,

1305
01:28:52,253 --> 01:28:57,123
and in a noble manner,
pass over the bird.

1306
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:01,787
- [Patrick] It indicates direction...
- [Riley] Somehow that bird...

1307
01:29:01,864 --> 01:29:05,698
...will rise from the rock
and kind of caw...

1308
01:29:05,768 --> 01:29:10,000
You can stand around guessing for a
while, or I can give you the next clue.

1309
01:29:11,273 --> 01:29:14,174
"Surrender your hand
to the heart of the warrior."

1310
01:29:15,711 --> 01:29:18,043
And the eagle
is a symbol of the warrior.

1311
01:29:23,452 --> 01:29:25,647
Ben, no. Wait, wait! No.

1312
01:29:25,721 --> 01:29:28,417
That's probably a horrible trap.
Tell him!

1313
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:30,048
It's a horrible trap.

1314
01:29:30,125 --> 01:29:33,754
It would be a pity to come this far
and not even try, now, wouldn't it?

1315
01:29:35,098 --> 01:29:36,463
I'll do it, Ben.

1316
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:38,089
It's OK.

1317
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:44,504
Surrender your hand.

1318
01:29:56,353 --> 01:29:58,344
[screaming]

1319
01:29:59,122 --> 01:30:01,454
[laughing]

1320
01:30:01,524 --> 01:30:04,618
- I am sorry. I... I couldn't resist.
- You!

1321
01:30:06,863 --> 01:30:10,321
It, uh... feels like a latch.

1322
01:30:12,435 --> 01:30:14,836
[crackling]

1323
01:30:19,677 --> 01:30:20,871
Look at this.

1324
01:30:32,823 --> 01:30:35,553
All right, good. Let's go.

1325
01:30:55,947 --> 01:30:57,539
[Emily] Oh!

1326
01:31:01,887 --> 01:31:03,354
Ben, look at this.

1327
01:31:04,256 --> 01:31:06,417
Oh, that's beautiful!

1328
01:31:10,195 --> 01:31:13,255
- Patrick. Patrick!
- [Abigail] Ben, what is that?

1329
01:31:13,331 --> 01:31:16,323
[Ben] Appears to be a counterweight
to hold the door open.

1330
01:31:16,401 --> 01:31:18,494
- [Riley] What is that sound?
- [groaning]

1331
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:19,901
[Emily] Fascinating.

1332
01:31:20,939 --> 01:31:22,634
[Riley shouting]

1333
01:31:23,542 --> 01:31:25,737
- [gasping]
- Ah!

1334
01:31:25,811 --> 01:31:26,869
Ben!

1335
01:31:37,323 --> 01:31:38,620
[Riley] Sorry.

1336
01:31:38,691 --> 01:31:40,283
- You OK?
- No.

1337
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:41,749
Get up.

1338
01:31:43,596 --> 01:31:44,585
It's locked.

1339
01:31:44,664 --> 01:31:49,431
- Patrick, what have you done?
- Some kind of a bolt. I didn't do it.

1340
01:31:49,502 --> 01:31:51,470
Only one way out of here now.

1341
01:31:53,539 --> 01:31:54,767
Forward.

1342
01:31:59,479 --> 01:32:02,448
[Emily gasps] Oh!

1343
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:09,754
Never seen so many relics.

1344
01:32:09,822 --> 01:32:11,916
So beautifully preserved.

1345
01:32:15,262 --> 01:32:17,924
Looks like we're going
to be moving some rocks.

1346
01:32:17,998 --> 01:32:21,434
- There's a tunnel back in through here.
- Guys, look at this.

1347
01:32:24,471 --> 01:32:25,995
It's a little golden man.

1348
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:33,444
Look. It's got a tiny little torso.
Look at that. It looks like...

1349
01:32:37,417 --> 01:32:38,645
[shouting]

1350
01:32:46,593 --> 01:32:48,390
- Ben!
- Ben!

1351
01:32:54,135 --> 01:32:57,400
Move back! Move back!
All of you! Other side!

1352
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:01,467
Back up! Back up!

1353
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:03,470
Ah!

1354
01:33:07,849 --> 01:33:09,817
Riley, move forward! Move forward!

1355
01:33:10,952 --> 01:33:12,419
No, back up, back up.

1356
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:16,648
- What you want me to do?
- Stop! Stop!

1357
01:33:20,361 --> 01:33:24,058
We have to balance our weight
to even this thing out.

1358
01:33:27,235 --> 01:33:29,294
- We'll find 'em.
- What are we gonna do?

1359
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:32,101
Figure something out.
Tell you what we're going to do.

1360
01:33:32,174 --> 01:33:34,540
- No, I'll tell you.
- No. I'll tell you!

1361
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:37,443
No, I'll tell you!
There's that passageway.

1362
01:33:37,513 --> 01:33:41,779
You go, pull those stones out,
because that leads somewhere.

1363
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:43,977
That is a good idea.

1364
01:33:47,523 --> 01:33:50,651
[Wilkinson] There's nothing.
Just a big old black hole.

1365
01:33:54,563 --> 01:33:57,031
[Abigail] Ben, look!
There's a ladder.

1366
01:33:57,099 --> 01:34:01,160
- I mean, what's left of a ladder.
- Toss me the light.

1367
01:34:03,672 --> 01:34:07,574
Riley. Move slowly to that corner.
No! Wait. Just...

1368
01:34:07,643 --> 01:34:10,772
- As I move to this corner.
- OK.

1369
01:34:12,949 --> 01:34:14,416
One step at a time. Good.

1370
01:34:18,788 --> 01:34:21,916
If we can raise this corner,
I think I'll reach it.

1371
01:34:23,827 --> 01:34:25,419
[shouting]

1372
01:34:25,495 --> 01:34:27,725
- Stop! Red light!
- You're not helping!

1373
01:34:27,797 --> 01:34:29,856
I can get up there just as easy as you.

1374
01:34:32,102 --> 01:34:33,091
Just stop.

1375
01:34:34,571 --> 01:34:36,732
- Guys!
- It's three against one here.

1376
01:34:36,806 --> 01:34:40,469
I ain't going last, and if I'm not
going last, I might as well go first.

1377
01:34:41,845 --> 01:34:42,834
Look!

1378
01:34:45,715 --> 01:34:47,307
What's it gonna be?

1379
01:34:56,761 --> 01:34:58,524
We'll do this your way.

1380
01:34:58,596 --> 01:35:01,121
[creaking, rumbling]

1381
01:35:12,576 --> 01:35:16,444
The rest of us, on my count of three,
all move together.

1382
01:35:16,514 --> 01:35:18,004
One step at a time.

1383
01:35:18,849 --> 01:35:21,875
One, two, three.

1384
01:35:41,206 --> 01:35:42,833
- You ready?
- Go.

1385
01:35:44,976 --> 01:35:47,240
[grunting]

1386
01:35:54,453 --> 01:35:55,442
Ah!

1387
01:36:16,709 --> 01:36:18,700
[Ben] Mitch, what do you see?

1388
01:36:20,012 --> 01:36:21,570
Is there a way out?

1389
01:36:23,182 --> 01:36:24,706
What's up there, Mitch?

1390
01:36:30,590 --> 01:36:34,754
[both grunting]

1391
01:36:36,562 --> 01:36:37,722
Em?

1392
01:36:37,797 --> 01:36:43,235
- Are you all right?
- Just promise me he's gonna be OK.

1393
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:48,967
All right.

1394
01:36:50,778 --> 01:36:51,904
Let's go.

1395
01:36:52,913 --> 01:36:55,381
Mitch! Come on!

1396
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:58,846
- I've been doing the math here, and...
- I know.

1397
01:36:59,286 --> 01:37:01,720
We're gonna have to leave
one person behind.

1398
01:37:01,789 --> 01:37:03,916
[Riley] Promise you'll
come back for me.

1399
01:37:03,991 --> 01:37:05,720
I can do the math too.

1400
01:37:07,127 --> 01:37:09,789
- That makes you next.
- I'll go last.

1401
01:37:11,498 --> 01:37:15,992
"No, we'll figure something else out."
"We need you there. Please, Riley."

1402
01:37:16,336 --> 01:37:17,667
[laughs]

1403
01:37:17,738 --> 01:37:18,898
I'm just kidding. Go.

1404
01:37:19,406 --> 01:37:20,964
OK...

1405
01:37:26,281 --> 01:37:29,739
[rumbling, creaking]

1406
01:37:49,904 --> 01:37:54,568
- One... two... three!
- Go!

1407
01:37:59,714 --> 01:38:01,079
Oh!

1408
01:38:01,716 --> 01:38:03,810
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1409
01:38:03,886 --> 01:38:05,444
Uh!

1410
01:38:09,391 --> 01:38:10,415
I can't get it.

1411
01:38:17,466 --> 01:38:19,457
Just go! Go now! Go!

1412
01:38:21,971 --> 01:38:23,836
- All right, ready?
- Now!

1413
01:38:23,906 --> 01:38:26,101
Ah!

1414
01:38:26,175 --> 01:38:27,938
Riley! Hang on!

1415
01:38:30,946 --> 01:38:35,474
OK. Mitch, the idol.
OK, Ben. We found a gold idol here!

1416
01:38:35,551 --> 01:38:38,247
We can roll it over
to offset your weight!

1417
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:39,685
Then roll it!

1418
01:38:42,993 --> 01:38:43,982
[Abigail] Here it comes!

1419
01:38:52,836 --> 01:38:54,235
[Riley] Come on, Ben!

1420
01:38:57,107 --> 01:38:58,836
Here! Give me your hand!

1421
01:39:01,244 --> 01:39:02,734
[Abigail] Ben!

1422
01:39:03,947 --> 01:39:05,005
Thanks, Riley.

1423
01:39:08,285 --> 01:39:10,150
Why couldn't a girl see me do that?

1424
01:39:14,157 --> 01:39:17,957
- You all right?
- You're OK. You're OK. You're OK.

1425
01:39:20,263 --> 01:39:22,459
So... forward.

1426
01:39:26,003 --> 01:39:29,166
- What is this?
- [running water]

1427
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:32,038
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1428
01:39:33,611 --> 01:39:34,839
Oh!

1429
01:39:39,584 --> 01:39:41,415
Put your light over there.

1430
01:39:44,388 --> 01:39:45,855
What are you doing?

1431
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:01,540
[grunts]

1432
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:01,801
[grunts]

1433
01:40:11,917 --> 01:40:14,385
[Riley] I can't see anything!
Is this it?

1434
01:40:19,891 --> 01:40:20,880
It's oil!

1435
01:40:59,999 --> 01:41:03,400
It's a dead end!
There's no way out!

1436
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:05,537
We have to turn back!

1437
01:41:15,148 --> 01:41:16,479
OK.

1438
01:41:19,086 --> 01:41:22,078
No. No, Patrick, this is crazy.

1439
01:41:24,958 --> 01:41:25,947
OK.

1440
01:41:31,098 --> 01:41:32,326
I got it!

1441
01:41:34,535 --> 01:41:37,095
I got you! I got you!

1442
01:41:37,171 --> 01:41:38,536
[both shouting]

1443
01:41:40,808 --> 01:41:43,936
[gasping]

1444
01:41:44,011 --> 01:41:46,343
[laughing]

1445
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,558
[Abigail] There's no forward!

1446
01:42:10,572 --> 01:42:12,767
It's not forward, it's down!

1447
01:42:13,742 --> 01:42:18,270
All this water has to go out somewhere.
Otherwise, it'd be filled up.

1448
01:42:28,656 --> 01:42:30,647
Help me turn this wheel!

1449
01:43:03,926 --> 01:43:05,791
[Wilkinson] The water's going down.

1450
01:43:55,913 --> 01:43:57,608
It is... Em.

1451
01:43:58,716 --> 01:44:00,707
Em. Em.

1452
01:44:06,924 --> 01:44:08,755
Ben! Hey!

1453
01:44:08,826 --> 01:44:13,126
Dad! We found it!

1454
01:44:13,497 --> 01:44:17,058
- Thomas was right!
- No, you were right!

1455
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:25,705
Sorry I smeared your
great-great granddaddy's good name.

1456
01:44:25,776 --> 01:44:28,336
Seemed like the only way
to get you in on the hunt.

1457
01:44:28,412 --> 01:44:33,179
But this was a chance for the Wilkinson
family to make its mark on history,

1458
01:44:33,251 --> 01:44:37,188
to find the City of Gold,
to be remembered.

1459
01:44:59,211 --> 01:45:01,771
[gurgling, bubbling]

1460
01:45:07,986 --> 01:45:11,319
What happened to you?
Your father was worried sick about you.

1461
01:45:11,390 --> 01:45:13,757
She was frantic. She was frantic.

1462
01:45:14,761 --> 01:45:18,162
Dad, coming through,
did you happen to see...?

1463
01:45:18,231 --> 01:45:22,167
Stop it. Coming through, did you see
any branches that could lead out?

1464
01:45:22,235 --> 01:45:26,228
No, it's all blocked. You can't even
get back to the big, round stone door.

1465
01:45:26,739 --> 01:45:28,263
Where's your mother going?

1466
01:45:29,676 --> 01:45:30,938
[Emily gasps]

1467
01:45:31,010 --> 01:45:34,207
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.
Have a look at this.

1468
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:35,372
- What?
- Look.

1469
01:45:35,448 --> 01:45:37,848
This is gonna unlock
the Olmec language.

1470
01:45:37,917 --> 01:45:41,546
It's gonna give us incredible
insight into pre-Columbian history.

1471
01:45:41,621 --> 01:45:43,452
Oh! [laughs]

1472
01:45:43,523 --> 01:45:45,286
[Patrick] Em?

1473
01:45:45,358 --> 01:45:47,952
- You happy?
- Oh, yeah.

1474
01:45:48,928 --> 01:45:51,920
- Ben! Look at this! Look!
- Oh, yeah.

1475
01:45:52,465 --> 01:45:55,299
That's where they slit the throat,
cut the heart out.

1476
01:46:03,077 --> 01:46:04,635
[laughs]

1477
01:46:08,215 --> 01:46:09,773
[banging]

1478
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:15,712
- What was that?
- Listen.

1479
01:46:15,789 --> 01:46:17,552
[banging]

1480
01:46:35,744 --> 01:46:37,507
Ah!

1481
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:45,513
I tried to find a way out.
All those portals are blocked off!

1482
01:46:45,587 --> 01:46:49,045
I'm telling you, all this water
goes out somewhere. We'll find it.

1483
01:46:56,564 --> 01:46:58,464
Ben, there's a current!

1484
01:46:58,900 --> 01:47:01,960
Follow it!
There's got to be a central drain!

1485
01:47:02,037 --> 01:47:04,130
It's under us. Right here!

1486
01:47:13,382 --> 01:47:14,371
Come on!

1487
01:47:15,818 --> 01:47:17,809
Let's go! Get in there!

1488
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:26,953
The water's rising too fast!

1489
01:47:27,029 --> 01:47:29,759
Let's get that door open
so we don't all drown!

1490
01:47:46,482 --> 01:47:49,645
Ben, it slopes down!
It's a drainage tunnel.

1491
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:52,484
It fills with water
when you open the door!

1492
01:47:52,589 --> 01:47:55,717
We need to find something
to stick under it to keep it open!

1493
01:47:55,759 --> 01:47:58,785
No, if it's open,
this tunnel will stay flooded.

1494
01:47:58,862 --> 01:48:01,558
We've got to get to the other side
and close the door.

1495
01:48:01,631 --> 01:48:03,360
Patrick, Emily, go!

1496
01:48:08,738 --> 01:48:09,796
- No.
- No!

1497
01:48:11,374 --> 01:48:12,363
No!

1498
01:48:12,442 --> 01:48:15,206
Mitch, we got to be
on the other side of that door!

1499
01:48:15,745 --> 01:48:17,542
Nobody leaves unless I say so.

1500
01:48:19,015 --> 01:48:21,609
That door is not gonna stay open
by itself.

1501
01:48:21,685 --> 01:48:23,915
We both know what has to happen here.

1502
01:48:24,421 --> 01:48:27,822
One of us keeps the door open
and stays behind.

1503
01:48:29,794 --> 01:48:30,886
I vote Mitch.

1504
01:48:31,963 --> 01:48:33,897
This isn't a democracy.

1505
01:48:33,965 --> 01:48:36,456
[grunting, shouting]

1506
01:48:38,536 --> 01:48:42,495
Stop! I'll stay!
I'm staying. Look. Look!

1507
01:48:43,441 --> 01:48:45,932
See? I'm right here! I'm staying!

1508
01:48:46,010 --> 01:48:48,740
I'll tell everybody
how this is going to go.

1509
01:48:48,813 --> 01:48:53,079
You and me are going to open that door.
Anybody tries to leave before me,

1510
01:48:53,184 --> 01:48:55,584
I drop the door,
we start this all over again!

1511
01:48:55,620 --> 01:48:59,522
Try any funny business, I guarantee you
people are going to get hurt!

1512
01:49:01,425 --> 01:49:04,917
I won't! You have my word.
Just let her go.

1513
01:49:08,967 --> 01:49:11,595
Ben, no, we're not leaving without you.

1514
01:49:13,572 --> 01:49:14,561
[Ben] Abigail.

1515
01:49:18,677 --> 01:49:22,408
You make my parents leave.
You make my parents leave.

1516
01:49:31,757 --> 01:49:33,019
- No!
- Let's go!

1517
01:49:33,525 --> 01:49:37,484
Let's go, please! Patrick, Emily,
he's trying to save our lives.

1518
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:39,857
Please, come on.

1519
01:49:41,833 --> 01:49:43,027
Push, Ben!

1520
01:49:46,705 --> 01:49:48,640
The current's too strong!

1521
01:49:51,878 --> 01:49:54,073
- I'm ready!
- It's all yours!

1522
01:50:10,063 --> 01:50:11,052
Ah!

1523
01:50:17,136 --> 01:50:18,296
Mom!

1524
01:50:18,871 --> 01:50:21,101
- [straining]
- Hang on!

1525
01:50:23,943 --> 01:50:25,205
Hold your breath!

1526
01:50:34,989 --> 01:50:36,820
Ah!

1527
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:38,619
We got to get Ben out of there!

1528
01:50:41,662 --> 01:50:45,962
If I'm stuck in the door,
it stays open,

1529
01:50:46,033 --> 01:50:48,968
both rooms fill up, and we all drown!

1530
01:50:49,036 --> 01:50:53,166
- Open the door! I'll get you out!
- The current's too strong!

1531
01:50:53,274 --> 01:50:55,799
I open the door,
you'll be washed down!

1532
01:50:55,843 --> 01:50:57,208
I'll get you out!

1533
01:50:57,278 --> 01:51:01,647
I found the City of Gold! I found it!

1534
01:51:01,715 --> 01:51:03,706
And no one will ever know?

1535
01:51:03,784 --> 01:51:08,017
We can figure this out!
We can all get out!

1536
01:51:08,089 --> 01:51:11,650
It's not a puzzle!
No more puzzles, Ben!

1537
01:51:11,726 --> 01:51:14,889
We're all going to die,
or it could just be me!

1538
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:19,188
- Tell them I found it!
- Don't quit!

1539
01:51:20,702 --> 01:51:22,829
- [straining]
- Mitch!

1540
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:33,038
Ah!

1541
01:52:03,312 --> 01:52:04,438
Thank you.

1542
01:52:21,964 --> 01:52:25,924
- We haven't officially met. I'm Riley.
- [Emily] Oh, hi.

1543
01:52:32,175 --> 01:52:34,735
Sir! It's for you.

1544
01:52:36,046 --> 01:52:37,035
Sadusky.

1545
01:52:37,981 --> 01:52:40,779
- I have my proof.
- Ben!

1546
01:52:41,184 --> 01:52:45,052
We were just talking about you.
Ready to turn yourself in?

1547
01:52:45,122 --> 01:52:48,785
Not quite.
We found the City of Gold.

1548
01:52:48,859 --> 01:52:51,657
Doesn't matter.
You still committed a federal crime.

1549
01:53:12,150 --> 01:53:14,744
Stop. Stop it.

1550
01:53:15,853 --> 01:53:18,185
- Mr. President?
- Craig, give us a minute.

1551
01:53:18,256 --> 01:53:22,022
Sir, for your information,
this is the man who kidnapped you.

1552
01:53:22,093 --> 01:53:24,857
As I recall, we were
exploring a hidden tunnel,

1553
01:53:24,929 --> 01:53:28,490
and a door closed accidentally,
and this man saved my life.

1554
01:53:28,833 --> 01:53:30,027
Yes, sir.

1555
01:53:32,236 --> 01:53:33,999
- Gates.
- Sir.

1556
01:53:35,072 --> 01:53:39,634
For the record, after centuries
of exploration, on this day,

1557
01:53:39,710 --> 01:53:43,238
you have brought honor
to your country and your family.

1558
01:53:44,783 --> 01:53:47,718
You've done this country
a great service. I thank you.

1559
01:53:48,253 --> 01:53:50,915
- Thank you.
- Craig.

1560
01:53:52,257 --> 01:53:56,523
I thought you might want to
take a look at tomorrow's headlines.

1561
01:53:58,096 --> 01:53:59,085
Tomorrow?

1562
01:54:07,306 --> 01:54:08,568
Thank you, sir.

1563
01:54:09,541 --> 01:54:12,009
All of you, along with
Emily and Patrick Gates

1564
01:54:12,077 --> 01:54:14,170
will get credit for this discovery.

1565
01:54:21,321 --> 01:54:23,687
And Mitch Wilkinson, sir.

1566
01:54:24,591 --> 01:54:28,425
- Is that right?
- It's true, sir.

1567
01:54:30,029 --> 01:54:33,021
Ben, I am curious
about that favor I asked you.

1568
01:54:34,567 --> 01:54:37,001
Any report regarding
what's on page 47?

1569
01:54:37,070 --> 01:54:39,265
I believe I can help with that, sir.

1570
01:54:39,339 --> 01:54:42,536
- So it's good.
- Life-altering, sir.

1571
01:54:46,212 --> 01:54:49,841
What's on page 47?
Are you talking about the Book?

1572
01:54:53,086 --> 01:54:54,212
What book?

1573
01:54:55,788 --> 01:54:59,849
[Emily] Be very careful with that.
Is that distilled water you're using?

1574
01:54:59,926 --> 01:55:02,191
- Yes.
- Have you catalogued all of this?

1575
01:55:02,263 --> 01:55:03,628
- No, ma'am.
- You haven't?

1576
01:55:03,697 --> 01:55:06,757
Excuse me? Excuse me, sir?
Are you cataloguing this?

1577
01:55:06,834 --> 01:55:10,133
You should've been there
when we picked out our first couch.

1578
01:55:14,108 --> 01:55:15,541
Excuse me.

1579
01:55:15,609 --> 01:55:19,511
Hey, you're that guy...
The treasure hunter guy, right?

1580
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:23,414
No, actually, the guy you're thinking of
is somewhere over there.

1581
01:55:23,484 --> 01:55:27,921
No. You're him. Riley Poole.
I recognize you from your book.

1582
01:55:28,589 --> 01:55:30,580
- Will you sign it?
- [crashing]

1583
01:55:30,658 --> 01:55:31,647
OK.

1584
01:55:40,902 --> 01:55:41,891
Thank you.

1585
01:55:43,238 --> 01:55:46,469
So, um, the tea tables...

1586
01:55:47,475 --> 01:55:51,206
Yes, I'm going to have the movers
bring them to you next week.

1587
01:55:52,180 --> 01:55:54,114
I was going to say
you can keep them.

1588
01:55:54,983 --> 01:55:59,113
And maybe you could...

1589
01:55:59,187 --> 01:56:01,485
...come and move back in with me.

1590
01:56:02,657 --> 01:56:05,455
- No. You used the word "so."
- So?

1591
01:56:05,527 --> 01:56:07,961
So, when you say "so,"
it means you're angry.

1592
01:56:08,029 --> 01:56:11,988
Sometimes.
And then sometimes it doesn't.

1593
01:56:12,067 --> 01:56:14,399
It's sort of like a puzzle.

1594
01:56:15,937 --> 01:56:19,601
And you're so good at puzzles.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

1595
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:23,338
So...

1596
01:57:04,054 --> 01:57:05,612
[sighs]

1597
01:57:07,691 --> 01:57:10,057
[engine starts]

1598
01:57:10,127 --> 01:57:11,754
I love this car.

1599
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,991
- [tires screech]
- [crashing]
