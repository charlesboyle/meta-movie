1
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:22,490
Get off the streets!
They're coming!

2
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,158
I see them, Miss Jessie.
They're here.

3
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,293
- Abe.
- Take care of the horses.

4
00:03:32,558 --> 00:03:37,100
Where are the men to stop them?
Where are the men to help Thomson?

5
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:41,265
I'd like to see them
all burn in hell.

6
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,626
Thomson!

7
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:14,384
Thomson, come out of there.

8
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:19,471
Roy, want me to go with you?

9
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:24,676
No, thanks.

10
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,896
This town may not need a deputy,
but it sure needs a fireman.

11
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:34,023
I'm here to talk about my man.
It's death, murder.

12
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:36,811
You've murdered too many
good men, Thomson.

13
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:41,106
Come out into the street.
Or are you a coward?

14
00:04:43,787 --> 00:04:46,360
A back-shooting coward
who won't face me!

15
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:03,513
Going for a ride,
sheriff?

16
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:09,566
Come on, let's give him a hand.

17
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:14,573
That's a boy, good boy.

18
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,817
Oh, Sheriff.

19
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,447
Come on, you're all dirty.
You've got to practice your mounting.

20
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,081
Look, here's a present for you.
Come on, get him up.

21
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:31,293
Let's give him a guard of honour.

22
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:19,170
I'm old.
Much too old.

23
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:25,501
Warlock beats me.
Got to get out of this town.

24
00:07:27,223 --> 00:07:29,511
- Got to get out.
- Too late.

25
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:32,718
Too late for us all.

26
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:03,076
- Come on, Curley.
- I can't find Johnny.

27
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,003
Where's my horse...?

28
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:13,675
Johnny!

29
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:18,471
- Wake up, Johnny.
- No, let me sleep.

30
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:21,970
You're a fine example
of a big brother.

31
00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:25,265
- I want to feel good...
- Yeah, sure. Come on.

32
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,930
Attaboy, Billy, help me.

33
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:32,271
- Help me to feel good.
- I can't figure you, Johnny.

34
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:33,644
I swear I can't figure you.

35
00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:38,574
Pony Benner!
Come on, let's go, Pony.

36
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:44,404
- Hurry up, I've got to go.
- If you'll just give me time.

37
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:47,453
It'll do no good.
You're the ugliest.

38
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:52,828
Come on.

39
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:56,335
Look what he did.

40
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:58,582
Look what he did.

41
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:04,841
Come on, Pony, let's go.

42
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,540
Johnny!
We've got to go.

43
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,640
Thomson didn't stand a prayer,
did he?

44
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:08,486
- Did he, Abe?
- Johnny, you're drunk.

45
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:12,819
Were Cade and Benner supposed to
shoot him before or after he drew?

46
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,454
They had orders to shoot only if
there was interference from outside.

47
00:10:17,622 --> 00:10:22,082
From who? No man in Warlock
would dare come against you.

48
00:10:22,251 --> 00:10:25,868
No? There's getting to be a lot more.
New ones all the time.

49
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:28,536
I've got to keep letting them
know I was here first.

50
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:32,043
How long does that give you
the right to run things your way?

51
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:35,053
- As long as I want.
- Yeah...

52
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:39,386
All I'm saying is,
when you stand to win,

53
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:42,475
you've got to be able
to stand to lose too.

54
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,722
The time has come to take up arms
in our defence.

55
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:49,480
Last night was the fourth time
in a month.

56
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,105
Driven to cover by them
murdering cowboys.

57
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:54,900
We put our faith in Thomson
and he ran.

58
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,530
While everyone else hid.

59
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,572
An excellent point, Miss Jessie.
It's time to stop hiding.

60
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:04,907
We've got them outnumbered 5 to 1.
We've got to fight them with arms.

61
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,955
At the risk of losing our own lives?

62
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,160
I have ore I have to deliver
from my silver mines.

63
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:13,830
Yet my miners are terrorised,
my wagons wrecked.

64
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:17,455
We can't let this anarchism, murder
and violence destroy Warlock,

65
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:19,506
even at the risk of our lives.

66
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:22,001
I say we arm ourselves
and stand and fight.

67
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:24,337
That's the only way
and you all know it.

68
00:11:24,514 --> 00:11:27,384
Wrong, wrong, wrong.
All wrong.

69
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:31,177
You're using anarchy and murder
to prevent anarchy and murder.

70
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:33,889
You're doing the same thing
as McQuown.

71
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:37,848
- What's the alternative, Judge?
- Law and order.

72
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:41,026
There is one other way,
we can hire our own marshal.

73
00:11:41,196 --> 00:11:43,686
- Lots of towns have done it.
- We can't hire a marshal.

74
00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:47,778
There's no such position here,
we're not legally a town.

75
00:11:48,494 --> 00:11:51,992
He'd be just as much a marshal
as you are ajudge, Mr. Holloway.

76
00:11:52,164 --> 00:11:56,789
On acceptance, as you put it. You'd
act for the citizens of Warlock.

77
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,533
The only way to handle this
is the legal way.

78
00:12:00,338 --> 00:12:02,129
Send for Sheriff Keller.

79
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:04,337
What'll he do?
Send another Thomson?

80
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:06,334
Keller's 50 miles away.

81
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,174
He might as well be a thousand,
for all the times he comes down here.

82
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:13,262
I say we try our own marshal.

83
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:21,098
This looks like a happy gathering.
Something we should know about?

84
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:25,514
Just foolish committee talk.
Something I can do for you?

85
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:30,444
With all this foolish committee talk,
half the stores in town are closed.

86
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:34,281
It is supply day at San Pablo,
Mr. Richardson.

87
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,786
Let's see, a half dozen
sacks of flour...

88
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:42,873
Give me a few minutes, Curley,
and I'll be open.

89
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:48,002
Yes, sir, Mr. Richardson.

90
00:12:48,713 --> 00:12:51,168
We wouldn't think of breaking up
such an important meeting.

91
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:55,258
I tell you what,
we'll wait outside.

92
00:12:55,428 --> 00:12:57,550
Pony, Johnny and me.

93
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:21,198
Benner killed our barber.

94
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:24,612
An hour ago, we were all
very indignant about that.

95
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:29,074
Yet, there he stood,
and none of us did anything.

96
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:32,790
All right, Henry.
You've made your point.

97
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:34,497
But who are you going to get
for your marshal?

98
00:13:35,421 --> 00:13:37,792
I have a man in mind.
Clay Blaisdell.

99
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:40,004
Serving at present
as marshal in Port James.

100
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:44,124
You mean, vigilante, gambler,
gunman.

101
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:47,461
I'm sure we've all
heard about him.

102
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:50,596
There's even been a book
written about him by Kalib Bane.

103
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:55,684
Mr. Bane attributes all manner
of courage to Mr. Blaisdell.

104
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:59,684
He presented him with a pair of
gold Colts for his brave deeds.

105
00:13:59,859 --> 00:14:02,230
I saw Blaisdell once,
in Port James.

106
00:14:02,737 --> 00:14:04,563
The day after he killed
big Ben Nicholson.

107
00:14:05,281 --> 00:14:10,405
Nicholson was a bad one.
Blaisdell deserved those colts.

108
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:17,279
Is this superhuman going to
subdue the savage beast

109
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,249
by the pure power of his eye,

110
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:22,585
or the menace of his six shooter,
or simply by his reputation?

111
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:25,255
None of those, Miss Jessie.

112
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,633
Blaisdell's only hope in Warlock
is to be lead-proof.

113
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:57,783
There she is, Clay.

114
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:00,567
Warlock.

115
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:03,236
A pretty enough town.

116
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,200
Better than some I've seen.

117
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,537
- Just for a short stay.
- We'll find out.

118
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:22,885
They're coming!
They're coming!

119
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:26,635
I saw them!
They're coming!

120
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:29,930
I saw them!
They're coming!

121
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:35,019
Well, Jessie.
There he comes,

122
00:15:35,193 --> 00:15:39,272
gold handled Colts and all.
This is a real beginning for Warlock.

123
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,716
- He's here.
- And I'm going.

124
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:14,516
- I've sold out to Morgan.
- I guess you have.

125
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,177
I wonder if we all have.

126
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:28,562
Morning, Mr. Blaisdell.

127
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,859
Blaisdell,
I'm Judge Holloway.

128
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:36,656
- I didn't know Warlock had ajudge.
- On acceptance only.

129
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:41,451
Same way you're a marshal.
I want to get a good look at you.

130
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:45,370
- They say you're a decent man.
- I thank you.

131
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,171
But it's not enough to be decent

132
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,467
where you have to kill men
and judge which men to kill,

133
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,677
the word is the law.

134
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,840
I guess I'll be the law, Judge,
on your acceptance.

135
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,307
Not on mine.
I don't accept you.

136
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:06,095
Any man who's got himself set
over others

137
00:17:06,273 --> 00:17:09,024
and isn't responsible
to something bigger

138
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:11,100
- Is a murdering swine.
- Shut up, Judge.

139
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:13,733
There's something bigger than
all men, and that's the law!

140
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:15,696
Do you hear me? The law!

141
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,698
- A nice welcome.
- Better than some I've seen.

142
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:27,321
As I understand it,
I have full authority

143
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:30,201
accountable to you,
the citizens' committee.

144
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:34,291
- Yes, accountable to us.
- That's what I said, Mr. Petrix.

145
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:39,215
I'll carry out my duties in ways
best fitted to the job,

146
00:17:39,386 --> 00:17:41,378
the aim being public safety.

147
00:17:41,554 --> 00:17:43,961
Peace and safety,
that's our aim.

148
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:47,468
You won't be surprised then,
if I have to post men out of town.

149
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:51,138
As a last resort, in the case
of real trouble makers,

150
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:54,765
they'll be informed they come
into town at the risk of their lives.

151
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:58,854
I suggest you start by posting
every one of the San Pablo cowboys.

152
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,024
Just a minute, Buck.
All those boys ain't bad.

153
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:05,359
I like Curley Burne and Billy Gannon,
among others.

154
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:06,696
It's McQuown and Benner...

155
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:11,078
Mr. Skinner and Mr. Slavin,
you'll let that be my choice.

156
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:14,864
There are one or two real trouble
makers. If I give you their names...

157
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:17,081
He's not your private marshal,
Mr. McDonald.

158
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:20,829
Also my choice,
Mr. McDonald.

159
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:22,832
One other thing.

160
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:25,758
Some of the town folk have been
wondering about Mr. Morgan

161
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:28,340
whether he'll have any
official status.

162
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:30,044
May I see that?

163
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,895
Tom Morgan is my friend.

164
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:41,387
We've been friends
for over ten years.

165
00:18:42,983 --> 00:18:46,316
I've never known him commit an evil
act. You'll have to take my word.

166
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:51,947
I started working for him as a faro
dealer. I still do on occasion.

167
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:55,199
- Faro dealer?
- Yes.

168
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:57,823
We're partners.

169
00:18:58,914 --> 00:19:03,374
The 400 dollars I get from you
would hardly pay for my ammunition.

170
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:08,457
Fortunately, as a faro dealer, I'm
an attraction. Things work out well.

171
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:11,455
I presume by that you mean
that people come

172
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,589
hoping to see you
shoot someone dead.

173
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:17,255
- You don't approve of me, Miss...
- Marlow. Jessie Marlow.

174
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:19,346
It really doesn't matter.
I'm in the minority.

175
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:23,808
You won't be in the minority
very long.

176
00:19:24,436 --> 00:19:26,309
People generally begin to resent me.

177
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:29,265
I don't mind,
it's part of the job.

178
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:32,141
- I let me assure you...
- It will happen.

179
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:36,777
I come here as your salvation
on a very high wage.

180
00:19:37,781 --> 00:19:41,363
I establish order,
ride roughshod over offenders.

181
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,114
At first, you're pleased because
there's less trouble.

182
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:48,240
Then, a strange thing happens.

183
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:52,835
You begin to feel I'm too powerful,
you begin to fear me.

184
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:55,663
Not me,
but what I am.

185
00:19:56,214 --> 00:20:00,211
When that happens, we'll have had
full satisfaction from one another

186
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,254
and it'll be time for me to leave.

187
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:06,591
You speak as though from experience.
Has this happened many times?

188
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,841
Yes, ma'am.
In a lot of towns.

189
00:20:10,935 --> 00:20:12,808
Clay, aren't you finished yet?

190
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:16,892
- Come on up.
- Excuse me.

191
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:19,978
We might as well adjourn.

192
00:20:24,572 --> 00:20:27,608
They can't hold guns,
but they sure can hold meetings.

193
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:30,273
What's that?

194
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:34,152
The black rattle snake
of Port James.

195
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:37,288
That's a very poetic image.

196
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:41,746
Come on, I'll show you
your quarters.

197
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:46,632
Murch, start cleaning up
downstairs.

198
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,831
All right.

199
00:20:49,344 --> 00:20:52,794
Well?
This'll fix up fine.

200
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:55,760
First, we get rid
of all this trash.

201
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:59,930
Look, we each have a bedroom.
I'll fix this up real fancy.

202
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,384
Don't work too hard.

203
00:21:01,563 --> 00:21:05,891
There's only one bunch of gangsters,
the McQuowns. Won't take too long.

204
00:21:06,568 --> 00:21:10,481
These aren't just tuners
like up in Port James.

205
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:12,982
I hear this is a bad bunch.

206
00:21:13,157 --> 00:21:15,612
In any case, let's drink
to the next town.

207
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:19,984
To this one, first, and a successful
meeting with the McQuowns.

208
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,610
The sooner, the better.

209
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:13,739
Get back to work.

210
00:22:43,736 --> 00:22:45,562
- Evening.
- It is, isn't it?

211
00:22:46,697 --> 00:22:49,152
Some of McQuown's boys
just came in.

212
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,993
Is that so?
McQuown come himself?

213
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:56,576
Not yet. I've been doing
a little investigating.

214
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,959
See that big fella?
That's Jack Cade.

215
00:23:02,128 --> 00:23:04,701
Number two to McQuown.
Next to him is Chet Haggin.

216
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:08,048
The little sneaky one on the right
is Pony Benner.

217
00:23:08,425 --> 00:23:11,342
Jack Cade is supposed to be
the meanest.

218
00:23:12,387 --> 00:23:15,138
- I see you added something.
- I wondered when you'd notice.

219
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,175
She came in the last batch from
San Francisco, with those drapes.

220
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:23,725
I held out because I didn't know if
you were big enough to handle her.

221
00:23:24,564 --> 00:23:27,730
Very pretty.
I wonder if McQuown's coming in.

222
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,983
Don't worry about McQuown.
He'll never come up against you.

223
00:23:31,695 --> 00:23:35,193
His style is to play with
a backshooter. Watch out for Cade.

224
00:23:36,324 --> 00:23:37,604
You said that before.

225
00:23:38,576 --> 00:23:40,651
Want me to handle
some of the action?

226
00:23:40,828 --> 00:23:44,113
I'll play it my way, Morgan.
See if they don't have to too.

227
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,122
It'll help to put on
your gold handled pair.

228
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,201
There'll be a lot disappointed
if they don't see them flash.

229
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:54,672
They're for Sundays.
This is a work day.

230
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:56,590
See you downstairs.

231
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,583
- I'm ready.
- All right.

232
00:24:00,762 --> 00:24:03,133
Let's have a drink
in the French Palace.

233
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:06,257
Maybe that marshal
will join us.

234
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:11,015
- Let's go get him.
- Take it easy, Billy.

235
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:12,847
Let's go, Johnny.

236
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:16,939
Murch, they're coming.

237
00:24:17,944 --> 00:24:20,315
Watch for backshooters.
Anyone moves, you let go.

238
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:22,396
With this?
It'll mash half the place.

239
00:24:22,573 --> 00:24:26,107
Anyone moves on Clay's back, let go.
I don't care who you mash.

240
00:24:26,577 --> 00:24:27,608
All right.

241
00:24:29,162 --> 00:24:32,032
- What will Blaisdell say?
- Nothing, if he's dead.

242
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:46,335
Evening, Mr. McQuown.
Gentlemen, the place is yours.

243
00:24:48,304 --> 00:24:50,177
- Nice place.
- Thank you.

244
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:52,221
A drink for Mr. McQuown
and his friends.

245
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:55,676
- Hope you enjoy yourselves.
- We will.

246
00:25:19,707 --> 00:25:22,577
Blaisdell will be half way back
to Port James by now.

247
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,372
- Don't you wish it, Pony?
- This is a different breed of horse.

248
00:25:28,298 --> 00:25:30,586
This will be a real good one.

249
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:34,589
Hey Billy, maybe you, me,
Curley and Chet

250
00:25:34,762 --> 00:25:36,635
can have a game of cards.

251
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:21,040
Whisky.

252
00:26:49,577 --> 00:26:50,952
Mr. Marshal.

253
00:26:54,498 --> 00:26:59,206
I wonder,
could I make a little complaint.

254
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:04,336
I guess it's up to me.

255
00:27:04,507 --> 00:27:05,965
There's just been a heap
of fussing about it,

256
00:27:06,134 --> 00:27:09,882
but it seems like folks have
gone and left it up to me.

257
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,514
It's them gold handles of yours,
Marshal.

258
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:21,677
I hope you ain't wearing them.
They're awfully hard on a man's eye.

259
00:27:24,358 --> 00:27:27,892
I'm just speaking for myself.

260
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:33,521
I'd hate to get a case of eye strain
from them gold handles.

261
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,321
They're so bright
in the sun and all...

262
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:42,200
A man just ain't much use
without his eyes.

263
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:47,665
And I hear there've been an awful
lot strained in Warlock lately.

264
00:27:49,422 --> 00:27:50,797
You could close your eyes.

265
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:56,089
I'd just look foolish.

266
00:27:56,511 --> 00:28:01,635
I'd bump all over the place, trying
to get around with my eyes closed.

267
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,178
Marshal, por favor,
couldn't you just

268
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:12,311
not polish the handles so bright
rubbing on them, like they say?

269
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,438
I guess I might do that,
if things felt right in town here.

270
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,445
Marshal,

271
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,202
what if somebody painted
them handles black for you?

272
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,702
That might do...

273
00:28:37,255 --> 00:28:38,535
But, who's to do it?

274
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,150
McQuown.

275
00:29:14,663 --> 00:29:15,694
McQuown.

276
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:27,671
McQuown, my name's Blaisdell,
I'm hired to keep the peace here.

277
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:32,090
I'm going to lay down two things
and back up all the way.

278
00:29:32,387 --> 00:29:33,584
The first one's this.

279
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,258
Any man starts a shooting scrape,
I'll kill, unless he kills me first.

280
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:44,095
Number two is what the citizen's
committee has agreed to.

281
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,438
If a man makes trouble, he'll
see himself posted out of town.

282
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:52,142
It's what some towns call
a white affidavit.

283
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:58,150
It's backed by me. Any man posted
comes in, comes in against me.

284
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:02,154
That's all I've got to say,
McQuown.

285
00:30:14,091 --> 00:30:15,122
Blaisdell!

286
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:21,428
- Go for your arm, Blaisdell.
- Billy!

287
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:29,097
- Go along, son.
- Let's go, Billy.

288
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:18,809
That wasn't so hard.

289
00:31:19,231 --> 00:31:21,022
I thought they'd never leave.

290
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:30,356
You dirty yellow,
I'll cut that stinking...

291
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:31,612
Stop it!

292
00:31:34,495 --> 00:31:38,077
- Stop it!
- One day, I'll shoot that hand off.

293
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,117
Stop it, Johnny.

294
00:31:41,084 --> 00:31:43,372
Let's not stand around
squalling at each other.

295
00:31:43,544 --> 00:31:46,710
I knew about Cade, now I know about
you. You're both backshooters.

296
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,666
That's enough.
It's bad enough we're running back

297
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,165
- Our tails between our legs
- I just want to make it plain.

298
00:31:52,594 --> 00:31:53,838
Shut up, Johnny.

299
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:56,131
Shut up.

300
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,015
You coming, Johnny?

301
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:14,650
No, Billy.

302
00:32:16,532 --> 00:32:18,654
I guess I'll be staying in town.

303
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:16,039
- Afternoon, Mr. Gannon.
- Hello, Mr. Morgan.

304
00:33:16,668 --> 00:33:19,538
Seems like you and me
are social pariahs.

305
00:33:20,212 --> 00:33:21,291
What do you mean?

306
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:24,794
We're the only two in town
not invited to the wedding.

307
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:30,424
- Yeah...
- Me, because I'm a no good gambler.

308
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:34,473
You, because you're a no good
San Pabloite.

309
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:38,393
I'm not a San Pabloite,
not anymore.

310
00:33:39,605 --> 00:33:43,187
It's a pity they don't believe you.
Just as they don't believe me.

311
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:56,150
- Weddings.
- You don't like them?

312
00:33:57,037 --> 00:34:00,950
Mr. Gannon,
we pretend to be free men.

313
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:04,957
Yet, when conventionality
spreads herself out fold by fold,

314
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:09,999
we eagerly approach pretty misses
that bind us to domesticity.

315
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,382
You read that in a book somewhere?

316
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,836
I think I just made it up.

317
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:24,517
What I'm trying to say is that
civilisation is stalking Warlock.

318
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:26,179
Mr. Morgan.

319
00:34:27,271 --> 00:34:30,805
I'm Fen Jiggs.
Ed Hamilton sent me from Port James.

320
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:33,599
Come inside.

321
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,740
Maybe you gentlemen feel
things have improved in Warlock.

322
00:34:47,915 --> 00:34:50,584
- Maybe your safety is improved.
- It certainly has.

323
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,248
Not one drop of bloodshed
since the marshal took over.

324
00:34:54,462 --> 00:34:58,044
It ain't the same outside, I lost
a thousand stock in two months.

325
00:34:58,382 --> 00:35:02,248
I ain't holding McQuown responsible,
but he's shifting a lot of cattle.

326
00:35:02,427 --> 00:35:05,297
It's not only rustling,
there are road agents.

327
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:08,223
I told my drivers
not to resist a hold up.

328
00:35:08,641 --> 00:35:10,965
I carry no shipments
of any value.

329
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,596
Today's the last bank shipment,
I don't count on it getting through.

330
00:35:14,772 --> 00:35:17,096
I'm making no accusations,
but if I were marshal

331
00:35:17,274 --> 00:35:20,274
I'd get after a couple
of boys named Benner and Friendly.

332
00:35:20,443 --> 00:35:21,474
What would you do with them?

333
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:26,777
Take them before ajury of trembling
fools that would let them off?

334
00:35:29,284 --> 00:35:31,572
- Allow me, Miss Marlow.
- Thank you.

335
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,748
- May I join you?
- Of course.

336
00:35:42,463 --> 00:35:46,045
I enjoyed your playing
and your singing.

337
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:49,424
- Thank you.
- You have a sensitive touch.

338
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:51,962
My mother played the melodeon.

339
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:57,807
Even killers and gunmen
have mothers, Miss Marlow.

340
00:35:58,101 --> 00:36:01,303
- And you loved and respected her.
- Yes, ma'am.

341
00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:07,639
Mr. Blaisdell.

342
00:36:09,695 --> 00:36:13,063
- I think I owe you an apology.
- What for, Miss Marlow?

343
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,403
Dr. Wagner told me what you did
against McQuown and his men.

344
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:21,777
You've done what nobody else
even came close to doing,

345
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:23,403
without firing a shot.

346
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:27,413
I did it only to convince you I'm not
the wickedest man in the west.

347
00:36:29,546 --> 00:36:32,463
I respect that,
and I admire you for it.

348
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:36,417
My father hated violence.

349
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:39,673
- He opened the mines, didn't he?
- Yes.

350
00:36:42,348 --> 00:36:44,921
Anyway, Mr. Blaisdell,
will you accept my apology?

351
00:36:45,518 --> 00:36:46,798
You see? It's happening.

352
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,019
I warned you about that in
my first meeting with the committee.

353
00:36:51,315 --> 00:36:53,686
People changing their minds
about me, I mean.

354
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:56,142
You said people would fear
and resent you.

355
00:36:56,653 --> 00:36:59,226
People that liked
and wanted me would,

356
00:36:59,697 --> 00:37:01,404
people that disliked me
would...

357
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:05,282
Change, Miss Marlow,
it's inevitable.

358
00:37:05,452 --> 00:37:08,902
- But it goes both ways.
- Does that worry you?

359
00:37:09,372 --> 00:37:13,120
No, not at all.
It has compensations.

360
00:37:20,507 --> 00:37:22,962
- How many on the stage?
- Three.

361
00:37:23,927 --> 00:37:26,880
Her, him and the one
from the bank in Bright City.

362
00:37:27,722 --> 00:37:31,304
There must be money in the box...
She could be in danger of a hold up.

363
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,009
You better leave now.
And tell Ed thanks.

364
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,384
I wasn't planning on going.

365
00:37:37,564 --> 00:37:40,683
Get a fresh horse at the stable,
tell them you work for me.

366
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:42,807
Thanks, Morgan.

367
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:46,688
- Ed said you'd be pleased to hear.
- I am pleased.

368
00:37:55,329 --> 00:37:57,451
Murch, have my horse saddled.

369
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:33,862
Here it comes.

370
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:24,532
Reach!
Put that down.

371
00:40:31,383 --> 00:40:32,545
Box down.

372
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:41,887
Let's see what the passengers have.

373
00:41:22,094 --> 00:41:23,801
Calhoun!

374
00:41:29,142 --> 00:41:31,513
Friendly!

375
00:42:12,555 --> 00:42:16,005
- Get the doc?
- Henry.

376
00:42:16,184 --> 00:42:19,599
- Get the doctor!
- Get the doctor!

377
00:42:29,862 --> 00:42:32,531
- What happened?
- Threw down on us on the road.

378
00:42:32,698 --> 00:42:35,864
Shot a passenger.
The team took off.

379
00:42:36,034 --> 00:42:37,907
One of them was Pony Benner.

380
00:42:38,078 --> 00:42:40,864
One was Pony Benner,
the other was Billy Gannon.

381
00:42:46,752 --> 00:42:48,744
If we ride to hit the river,
we can get them.

382
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:50,829
Marshal, deputise me
and I'm your man.

383
00:42:51,006 --> 00:42:54,089
- I'll ride with you, marshal.
- Jack, get some horses ready.

384
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:57,046
- There were two of them?
- Only Benner and Bill.

385
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,845
There were three.

386
00:43:03,225 --> 00:43:07,969
- I only saw two.
- There was one up on the ridge.

387
00:43:08,354 --> 00:43:11,105
- The one that killed the big fella?
- What big fella?

388
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:15,607
My friend's name was Nicholson,
Bob Nicholson.

389
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:18,316
A brother to Ben Nicholson
of Texas.

390
00:43:20,657 --> 00:43:22,863
We had to let him lay
when the team took off wild.

391
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,448
- I'd like to go with you.
- Didn't you hear, Gannon?

392
00:43:26,746 --> 00:43:29,948
- One of them was your brother.
- I said I'd like to go.

393
00:43:30,332 --> 00:43:31,873
Ride out after the passenger.

394
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,828
- I'd rather not.
- Somebody has to, I'm asking you.

395
00:43:42,259 --> 00:43:44,796
Well, boys, let's go see
what San Pablo looks like.

396
00:43:56,522 --> 00:43:59,273
Welcome to Warlock, Miss...

397
00:44:49,985 --> 00:44:52,392
So you couldn't get along
without me, Lily?

398
00:44:57,033 --> 00:45:00,401
- You could've told me you were coming.
- Didn't you know?

399
00:45:00,578 --> 00:45:04,028
- I'd have had a brass band out.
- Didn't you?

400
00:45:05,165 --> 00:45:06,279
Didn't you?

401
00:45:23,306 --> 00:45:24,800
Won't you come into my parlour?

402
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,348
Remind you of home, Lily?

403
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:37,692
I was on the stage
when it was held up.

404
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:42,736
- That must've been exciting.
- A man was killed.

405
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:46,192
So I heard. Somebody said
he looked like a high roller.

406
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:51,325
- He wasn't with you, was he, Lily?
- It was Ben Nicholson's brother.

407
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:58,623
I went more than 5000 miles
looking for Ben Nicholson's brother.

408
00:46:01,298 --> 00:46:02,460
Lily, Lily...

409
00:46:04,384 --> 00:46:06,423
How you run to those Nicholsons.

410
00:46:07,387 --> 00:46:09,046
Haven't you had enough
of killing?

411
00:46:10,264 --> 00:46:13,549
Not till I see Blaisdell
shot dead.

412
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:16,975
Wherever he goes, I'll follow him
and see him shot down.

413
00:46:18,813 --> 00:46:21,220
For taking away the only
chance I ever had,

414
00:46:22,442 --> 00:46:24,648
and killing the only decent man
I ever knew.

415
00:46:25,736 --> 00:46:28,855
You have decent mixed up.

416
00:46:30,365 --> 00:46:33,650
There is one decent man,
but hell has turned you loose on him.

417
00:46:34,994 --> 00:46:37,033
Ben Nicholson
was a cheap gunman.

418
00:46:37,538 --> 00:46:40,159
He came after Clay, called him up
and drew first.

419
00:46:40,749 --> 00:46:42,540
You put Clay up to it.

420
00:46:43,794 --> 00:46:47,244
If you believe that,
you should get somebody to shoot me.

421
00:46:47,422 --> 00:46:51,632
There'd be no satisfaction
for me in that.

422
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:57,254
You don't care about yourself,
but you do care about Clay.

423
00:46:58,807 --> 00:47:00,514
And when he'd dead
and in the dust,

424
00:47:01,142 --> 00:47:03,679
I'll look at you over his body
and laugh.

425
00:47:05,271 --> 00:47:07,227
Lily, Lily, Lily...

426
00:47:08,649 --> 00:47:10,226
You'd better leave Warlock.

427
00:47:10,901 --> 00:47:12,359
You'd like me to go.

428
00:47:14,696 --> 00:47:16,190
You'd give a lot, wouldn't you?

429
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:21,357
I'd give a lot more to have you
come back to me, Lily.

430
00:47:22,494 --> 00:47:23,738
For what?

431
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:28,119
So you can send me back to work
whenever you run short of money?

432
00:47:30,793 --> 00:47:32,785
I thought you did it
because you loved me.

433
00:47:37,716 --> 00:47:41,547
How could I have ever?
You cripple!

434
00:47:57,817 --> 00:48:00,651
The marshal's back.
The marshal's back.

435
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:13,788
Mike, you and Slater
take him inside.

436
00:48:13,956 --> 00:48:16,529
They've got Pony Benner,
the killer.

437
00:48:16,709 --> 00:48:18,997
- Trouble?
- No, they came like lambs.

438
00:48:19,169 --> 00:48:22,169
McQuown spouted scripture
about truth and justice.

439
00:48:22,589 --> 00:48:25,957
He's already on his way
to make sure he gets the right jury.

440
00:48:26,134 --> 00:48:28,671
That's out of our hands.
I sent Sam Brown for the sheriff.

441
00:48:28,844 --> 00:48:31,880
- Let's hang them, marshal.
- Let's save the sheriff a trip.

442
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:34,807
- Yeah, marshal, let's hang them.
- Yeah, hang 'em.

443
00:48:34,975 --> 00:48:36,516
- Hang 'em.
- Hang 'em, marshal, right now.

444
00:48:36,685 --> 00:48:40,302
Guard them till the sheriff arrives.
Use as many men as you need.

445
00:48:53,616 --> 00:48:55,608
Get out of here.
This isn't an assembly hall.

446
00:48:58,871 --> 00:49:00,329
Let's hang them now!

447
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:15,838
- I expect they mean to make trouble.
- I don't think so.

448
00:49:16,636 --> 00:49:18,544
Just the same,
we better stay here.

449
00:49:20,348 --> 00:49:21,592
You better go, Gannon.

450
00:49:21,974 --> 00:49:26,302
- I just want to talk to my brother.
- I had nothing to do with it.

451
00:49:27,104 --> 00:49:29,345
You're better with a Winchester
than with your mouth, Calhoun.

452
00:49:29,523 --> 00:49:32,440
I wasn't even there.
Go on, tell him.

453
00:49:36,445 --> 00:49:40,228
- They'll be trouble down there.
- Sounds like it.

454
00:49:40,866 --> 00:49:45,029
- Saw someone today to shock a man.
- Yeah.

455
00:49:46,705 --> 00:49:49,160
- You seen her?
- Yeah.

456
00:49:51,834 --> 00:49:54,585
People I'd rather see in Warlock
than Lily.

457
00:50:01,384 --> 00:50:06,460
The passenger they shot
was Ben Nicholson's brother.

458
00:50:07,389 --> 00:50:09,345
Came after me, I guess.

459
00:50:09,558 --> 00:50:13,507
Looks like them bad boys
did you a favour.

460
00:50:14,437 --> 00:50:17,556
I never could figure that
Ben Nicholson gunning for me.

461
00:50:17,732 --> 00:50:20,483
He'd settled down, there was even
talk of him and Lily getting married.

462
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:24,568
There was talk of
a lot of men and Lily.

463
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,814
Ben Nicholson
was a man with pride.

464
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,109
He had to be top man,
so he tried you out, that's all.

465
00:50:30,785 --> 00:50:32,195
Is that all?

466
00:50:32,745 --> 00:50:35,235
He had a reputation,
but he wasn't that kind.

467
00:50:36,582 --> 00:50:38,740
I'd hate to think there was no reason
for me to kill Ben Nicholson.

468
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:42,787
He was on the prowl for you.
He came gunning for you.

469
00:50:43,421 --> 00:50:45,958
Now, his brother comes after you.

470
00:50:49,176 --> 00:50:52,129
- Is it that simple?
- Clay, it's that simple.

471
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:14,231
Hold it! Hold it!

472
00:51:14,865 --> 00:51:17,272
Get out of here before I shoot.

473
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:19,573
- You can't stop us.
- You'll see if I don't.

474
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:22,911
If you think a bunch of drunks
are going to bust this jail,

475
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:24,740
you're mistaken.
Get out of here!

476
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,041
We'll tromp you down,
Slavin.

477
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,036
What's Johnny Gannon doing here?
He's one of them.

478
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,539
I said, get.

479
00:51:50,647 --> 00:51:53,481
- Need another man?
- We surely do, Clay.

480
00:51:53,649 --> 00:51:56,020
We're taking those road agents
out to hang, Blaisdell.

481
00:51:56,193 --> 00:51:59,608
You ain't gonna stop us.
We'll tromp you down like the rest.

482
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,653
Come and tromp me, Fitz.

483
00:52:03,366 --> 00:52:04,646
Come here.

484
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,620
Come here.

485
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:16,249
- This ain't your pudding, marshal.
- Come here.

486
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:25,333
You've done McQuown's work tonight,
Blaisdell.

487
00:52:25,511 --> 00:52:28,879
If you've anything to say,
say it, or go home.

488
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:33,424
All of you, go home.

489
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,181
And while you're doing it,

490
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:44,558
think how being in a lynch mob
is a low a thing as a man can do.

491
00:52:48,072 --> 00:52:50,906
Thank you, marshal.
Thank you kindly.

492
00:52:51,659 --> 00:52:54,659
I have to thank you.
It was my job.

493
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:02,116
There's a man.

494
00:53:03,044 --> 00:53:06,542
Why don't you bring his boots and
we'll kiss them like he wants?

495
00:53:06,714 --> 00:53:10,331
Like you all do.
Bring us his boots!

496
00:53:13,636 --> 00:53:15,960
He just saved your life,
Billy.

497
00:53:18,808 --> 00:53:20,681
I wonder why.

498
00:53:35,489 --> 00:53:38,525
Mr. Richardson, you'll see that
any witnesses against him

499
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,443
get to the trial.

500
00:53:40,618 --> 00:53:42,277
A lot of good that'll do,
sheriff.

501
00:53:42,704 --> 00:53:44,660
If you thought that, why didn't
you let the mob have him?

502
00:53:46,165 --> 00:53:48,287
We don't do things that way
in Warlock.

503
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,037
Oh, we don't?

504
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:58,212
I hear you get paid 400 a month,
Mr. Blaisdell.

505
00:53:59,802 --> 00:54:01,758
You and Morgan
are quite a team.

506
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:06,134
I hear you have silk sheets
from China.

507
00:54:07,058 --> 00:54:09,299
I get a hundred a month
for being legal sheriff.

508
00:54:09,477 --> 00:54:11,801
Plus rheumatism
from sleeping cold nights.

509
00:54:15,733 --> 00:54:19,183
Mr. Blaisdell,
I've read a lot about you.

510
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:23,146
The way I figure, you operate outside
the law, same as those cowboys.

511
00:54:23,323 --> 00:54:27,450
What law?
When do you come down here?

512
00:54:27,618 --> 00:54:29,491
Why aren't we supplied
with enough deputies?

513
00:54:29,662 --> 00:54:33,575
Job's open. You can have
all the deputies you want.

514
00:54:33,748 --> 00:54:36,072
Well, you want the job, Buck?

515
00:54:37,001 --> 00:54:40,203
For what? 40 dollars a month
and a free pine box.

516
00:54:42,047 --> 00:54:43,078
How about you?

517
00:54:43,924 --> 00:54:45,963
You want to try doing it legal
for once?

518
00:54:46,134 --> 00:54:50,000
Sorry, sheriff. The principle
appeals to me, but the pay doesn't.

519
00:54:54,225 --> 00:54:56,596
Any man here ready to be deputy?

520
00:54:56,769 --> 00:54:59,093
Or is everyone in Warlock
chicken-livered?

521
00:54:59,271 --> 00:55:01,144
Or too greedy?

522
00:55:01,606 --> 00:55:04,096
You want law in this town,
I offer you law.

523
00:55:04,275 --> 00:55:07,275
Just don't come whining to me
when there's trouble.

524
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:12,231
And watch yourselves, hiring outside
gunmen who make a living by killing.

525
00:55:14,034 --> 00:55:15,825
Anybody?

526
00:55:17,662 --> 00:55:19,072
All right, then.

527
00:55:21,249 --> 00:55:25,495
- I'll take the job.
- You, Johnny Gannon?

528
00:55:27,212 --> 00:55:28,955
If you think I can do it.

529
00:55:37,263 --> 00:55:40,429
Sure you can do it, Johnny.
Sure you can.

530
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:41,927
Come inside.

531
00:55:51,483 --> 00:55:53,142
Keller, you can't do this.

532
00:55:53,318 --> 00:55:55,191
- Why can't I?
- He's one of them.

533
00:55:56,363 --> 00:55:58,853
I've known Johnny Gannon
all his life.

534
00:55:59,032 --> 00:56:00,858
He seems to have been
a good boy.

535
00:56:01,034 --> 00:56:04,200
Maybe a little wild,
but you can't condemn a man for that.

536
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:07,868
Further, you can't condemn a man
for his brother or friends.

537
00:56:08,332 --> 00:56:11,001
What's more, he volunteered
when no one else did.

538
00:56:11,418 --> 00:56:13,825
So I'm making him
the new deputy of Warlock.

539
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,876
And he'll be there
till I remove him.

540
00:56:16,047 --> 00:56:18,205
Or he's carried out.

541
00:56:18,966 --> 00:56:22,381
You know you're putting him up
against Blaisdell?

542
00:56:22,594 --> 00:56:24,752
Against any law breakers.

543
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:26,969
You understand that,
don't you, Johnny?

544
00:56:27,724 --> 00:56:29,846
- I understand.
- Fine.

545
00:56:31,477 --> 00:56:33,101
Adiós, gentlemen.

546
00:56:35,772 --> 00:56:39,436
Looks like law's coming back
to Warlock.

547
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:42,893
But for how long, Judge?

548
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:12,965
Miss Dollar,

549
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:16,802
I just saw you coming up here.

550
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:20,557
- You're the new deputy?
- Yes, my name's John Gannon.

551
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:24,981
I thought I might ask you
a few questions.

552
00:57:28,235 --> 00:57:31,271
Those boys were let off, you know.
Acquitted.

553
00:57:31,446 --> 00:57:32,856
Isn't that what everyone expected?

554
00:57:33,031 --> 00:57:36,862
Yes, ma'am, but I'd like to know
who killed your Mr. Nicholson.

555
00:57:37,035 --> 00:57:38,991
He wasn't mine.

556
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:45,621
You said there was a third man,
a shot came from behind some rocks.

557
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:48,828
So it did. But what's the difference?
They got off.

558
00:57:49,003 --> 00:57:51,244
Yes, ma'am,
but I'd still like to know.

559
00:57:51,422 --> 00:57:54,091
Of course, your brother was
one of them. They're your friends.

560
00:57:55,843 --> 00:57:58,512
I'm not one of them, Miss Dollar.

561
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:01,430
Suppose I tell you I know
who killed him, what would you do?

562
00:58:01,598 --> 00:58:04,551
I'd go after him.
Do you know?

563
00:58:05,601 --> 00:58:09,550
No, there's very little I know.
I'm a woman, I only feel things.

564
00:58:10,105 --> 00:58:13,105
You're a deputy and you want
answers to questions.

565
00:58:13,275 --> 00:58:15,350
- I tell you it doesn't matter.
- It does matter.

566
00:58:15,527 --> 00:58:18,278
The citizen's committee
is meeting right now.

567
00:58:18,446 --> 00:58:22,525
And those men from San Pablo
will be posted out of town.

568
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:25,652
- By Clay Blaisdell?
- Yes. And if they didn't do it...

569
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,362
Your brother's just a boy,
isn't he?

570
00:58:29,122 --> 00:58:31,280
He's nineteen.

571
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,955
No, he's not a boy.

572
00:58:35,961 --> 00:58:38,630
But that's not really
why I care.

573
00:58:38,797 --> 00:58:40,255
- No?
- No, ma'am.

574
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:45,506
I'm the deputy sheriff,
and if Clay Blaisdell goes after him,

575
00:58:46,971 --> 00:58:51,217
I believe it's my job
to keep the law.

576
00:58:53,644 --> 00:58:56,846
- You'd go against Blaisdell?
- If I have to.

577
00:59:00,274 --> 00:59:03,559
I'm not a boy either,
Miss Dollar.

578
00:59:07,864 --> 00:59:09,358
Mr. Gannon...

579
00:59:14,871 --> 00:59:16,863
I'm sorry.

580
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,957
I've rented a house.

581
00:59:22,294 --> 00:59:25,294
I rented it off Mr. Petrix and...

582
00:59:25,672 --> 00:59:29,040
some boys are dropping
my trunks round this afternoon.

583
00:59:30,217 --> 00:59:31,592
I wonder if you'd help me
move in?

584
00:59:34,388 --> 00:59:37,922
Sure.
I'd like to help.

585
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:39,427
- Around five.
- All right.

586
00:59:39,601 --> 00:59:42,222
- I'll try and cook supper for us.
- Fine.

587
00:59:44,105 --> 00:59:46,393
You don't have to look
so worried.

588
00:59:46,565 --> 00:59:48,142
I can cook.

589
01:00:24,056 --> 01:00:26,677
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

590
01:00:26,892 --> 01:00:29,098
I thought you'd come
dressed for work.

591
01:00:29,436 --> 01:00:33,219
You said work and supper,
so I wasn't sure.

592
01:00:33,398 --> 01:00:36,268
- So I did. Come in.
- Thanks.

593
01:00:40,779 --> 01:00:42,522
It's a nice place.

594
01:00:42,823 --> 01:00:45,313
There'll be no supper
till all the work's done.

595
01:00:45,492 --> 01:00:47,982
All right.
What would you like me to do first?

596
01:00:48,161 --> 01:00:50,402
You can start by putting
those trunks in my bedroom.

597
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,204
Yes, ma'am.

598
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,633
That smells mighty good,
Miss Dollar.

599
01:01:14,517 --> 01:01:17,802
- Corn bread, meat and greens.
- Fine.

600
01:01:18,938 --> 01:01:21,096
Guess there's not many men
in Warlock

601
01:01:21,273 --> 01:01:22,980
eating home cooked food tonight.

602
01:01:24,234 --> 01:01:27,187
- Keep working, deputy.
- Yes, ma'am.

603
01:01:31,157 --> 01:01:32,781
Mighty good.

604
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:38,991
You didn't finish your greens,
Mr. Gannon.

605
01:01:40,582 --> 01:01:45,326
- My mother used to say that.
- It's a thing women say.

606
01:01:45,711 --> 01:01:49,126
- Where is she?
- She's dead, Miss Dollar.

607
01:01:49,882 --> 01:01:52,716
Lily. Just Lily.

608
01:01:54,636 --> 01:01:59,546
She died about nineteen years ago
in Nebraska.

609
01:02:01,392 --> 01:02:04,677
- And you father?
- The Apaches killed him.

610
01:02:04,853 --> 01:02:07,308
That was in the early days
out here.

611
01:02:07,481 --> 01:02:11,347
And Blaisdell's going to kill
your brother and the others.

612
01:02:12,193 --> 01:02:16,142
- If they come into town.
- You know they'll come in.

613
01:02:18,073 --> 01:02:23,149
You knew Blaisdell back in
Port James, didn't you?

614
01:02:24,204 --> 01:02:27,287
Long before Port James.
I knew Morgan.

615
01:02:27,582 --> 01:02:29,621
If you knew Morgan,
you knew Blaisdell.

616
01:02:30,876 --> 01:02:32,915
He dealt faro for Morgan.

617
01:02:33,086 --> 01:02:36,122
People knew him as a killer
right from the start.

618
01:02:37,173 --> 01:02:39,248
He was a colonel in the army
at 21.

619
01:02:39,425 --> 01:02:43,837
He never quit being a colonel.
All he knows is killing.

620
01:02:45,889 --> 01:02:47,466
What sort of man
is this McQuown?

621
01:02:48,683 --> 01:02:52,181
Worse than he ought to be
and getting worse all the time.

622
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:56,310
- I used to think highly of him.
- But you left,

623
01:02:56,649 --> 01:02:58,273
and your brother stayed on.

624
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:03,518
That's right.
I left.

625
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:08,360
- Why?
- Oh, a lot of reasons.

626
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,866
What reasons?

627
01:03:12,788 --> 01:03:17,283
I never told anybody this before,
but...

628
01:03:19,627 --> 01:03:22,497
About 10 months ago, some Mexicans
were supposed to have been massacred

629
01:03:22,672 --> 01:03:25,458
by Apaches
in Rattlesnake Canyon,

630
01:03:25,633 --> 01:03:27,755
at least, everybody said
it was Apaches.

631
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,088
But it wasn't?

632
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:35,844
No... No it wasn't.

633
01:03:39,436 --> 01:03:44,642
You see, we'd rustled more than
a thousand head at Haciendo Puerto

634
01:03:45,275 --> 01:03:49,402
across the border, but those
Mexicans trailed us back here.

635
01:03:51,113 --> 01:03:55,489
So one night, a bunch of us stripped,
smeared ourselves with mud

636
01:03:55,659 --> 01:03:58,149
and boxed them up
in Rattlesnake Canyon.

637
01:03:59,537 --> 01:04:03,913
We killed them all.
37 of them.

638
01:04:06,335 --> 01:04:07,994
37...

639
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:14,673
I don't know,
it was kind of like a dream.

640
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:20,131
I'll never forget laying there,
sweating, covered with mud, waiting.

641
01:04:21,515 --> 01:04:23,673
It was so quiet

642
01:04:24,726 --> 01:04:27,014
and then, they came.

643
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,686
Abe gave the signal,
we all started to fire.

644
01:04:32,983 --> 01:04:34,358
It was just awful.

645
01:04:35,402 --> 01:04:38,568
I don't think they got off
a single shot.

646
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:43,690
All around me, Abe and the rest
were screaming like Apaches

647
01:04:44,077 --> 01:04:48,156
firing into the canyon till
there wasn't anybody left to shoot.

648
01:04:51,667 --> 01:04:55,664
I say it was like a dream,
but it wasn't, it was real.

649
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:59,751
It happened that way.

650
01:05:47,257 --> 01:05:50,672
- Good afternoon, Miss Jessie.
- I was just out riding...

651
01:05:50,844 --> 01:05:52,836
on my way to Medusa Mine

652
01:05:53,012 --> 01:05:56,462
and I heard the shots.
I had no idea it was you.

653
01:06:01,978 --> 01:06:05,975
- My, it's hot today.
- Yes, ma'am, it certainly is.

654
01:06:06,149 --> 01:06:09,517
- Not as hot as yesterday though.
- No, not nearly.

655
01:06:10,778 --> 01:06:15,154
I heard Buck Slavin say
he thought today was hotter.

656
01:06:16,491 --> 01:06:21,615
- Matter of opinion, I guess.
- Of course, a matter of opinion.

657
01:06:27,918 --> 01:06:30,325
Would you happen to have
some water in that canteen?

658
01:06:30,503 --> 01:06:34,416
- The heat makes one terribly thirsty.
- Yes, ma'am, I do.

659
01:06:41,221 --> 01:06:43,972
That's all right, I can drink
right from the canteen.

660
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:53,219
- You were out riding, you said.
- On my way to Medusa mine.

661
01:06:54,399 --> 01:06:57,316
That mountain water sure
makes one feel much cooler.

662
01:06:57,694 --> 01:07:00,184
Yes, ma'am, it generally does.

663
01:07:01,114 --> 01:07:05,111
What are you doing out here?
Not shooting at bad men?

664
01:07:05,659 --> 01:07:08,529
- No, practising.
- Practising?

665
01:07:08,954 --> 01:07:13,081
Yes, ma'am. Just as you practice
the piano, I practice the Colt.

666
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:17,536
The stakes are different,
but the reason's the same.

667
01:07:21,131 --> 01:07:23,882
What should we talk about now,
Miss Jessie?

668
01:07:25,552 --> 01:07:27,923
The men you posted
are coming into town.

669
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,553
Thank you for warning me,
but I've already heard.

670
01:07:30,723 --> 01:07:32,679
Why does it have to happen?

671
01:07:33,392 --> 01:07:36,061
Why do these things always end
in bloodshed?

672
01:07:36,228 --> 01:07:38,303
That's how things are.

673
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,017
That's why I was hired,
why you hired me.

674
01:07:42,942 --> 01:07:45,230
So, they'll come into town

675
01:07:45,403 --> 01:07:49,269
- And you'll shoot them dog dead?
- Or them me.

676
01:07:53,076 --> 01:07:54,867
Or them you.

677
01:07:57,872 --> 01:08:01,287
Understand, Miss Jessie,
I enjoy being marshal.

678
01:08:02,292 --> 01:08:04,498
I'm a simple man,
good only with Colts.

679
01:08:04,669 --> 01:08:07,338
It's all I am,
handy with Colts.

680
01:08:07,589 --> 01:08:12,001
Besides, being marshal's a habit.
Habits are hard to break.

681
01:08:12,343 --> 01:08:14,418
I know about habits.

682
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:18,931
Before my father died he was sick
for nine years

683
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:21,138
and I nursed him all that time.

684
01:08:21,768 --> 01:08:24,305
Guess I have the nursing habit.

685
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,265
That summer,
there was a typhoid epidemic

686
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,977
and I turned the house
into a hospital.

687
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:33,186
There were the injured
miners...

688
01:08:34,237 --> 01:08:36,443
It's strange...

689
01:08:36,781 --> 01:08:38,737
When I came to Warlock,
a very young girl

690
01:08:38,908 --> 01:08:42,157
I had dreams that someday,
I'd be someone.

691
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,075
My father kept telling me
I'd be someone.

692
01:08:45,247 --> 01:08:48,283
You're someone, Miss Jessie.
You're the miners' angel.

693
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,913
Don't say that.
I hate being an angel.

694
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:52,247
Miss Jessie.

695
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:55,705
If you had whisky in that canteen,
you'd see how much of an angel I am.

696
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,421
Have you ever tasted whisky?

697
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:03,091
- Many times.
- How many?

698
01:09:06,349 --> 01:09:07,511
Once.

699
01:09:25,699 --> 01:09:28,782
- I wanted you to do that.
- I know.

700
01:09:29,828 --> 01:09:33,445
- I came out here to find you.
- I know.

701
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,617
Is that dreadful of me?

702
01:09:37,501 --> 01:09:38,781
Dreadful.

703
01:10:06,944 --> 01:10:08,936
It's cooked just right,
Jessie.

704
01:10:09,112 --> 01:10:11,816
It takes a while
to get used to a man's tastes.

705
01:10:12,115 --> 01:10:14,736
My father used to like his meat
barely scorched.

706
01:10:14,909 --> 01:10:17,233
Chicken fried,
that's the only way.

707
01:10:19,788 --> 01:10:20,902
Clay...

708
01:10:21,873 --> 01:10:24,542
Why must those cowboys
come into town?

709
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:28,243
They've been declared guilty
of being road agents.

710
01:10:28,838 --> 01:10:31,921
If they stay out,
yellow bellies besides.

711
01:10:32,508 --> 01:10:35,461
If they come in,
they'll think they're heroes

712
01:10:35,636 --> 01:10:37,011
proving their innocent.

713
01:10:37,179 --> 01:10:39,467
Striking a blow for freedom, too.

714
01:10:39,973 --> 01:10:41,467
Men have died for that
many a time.

715
01:10:44,226 --> 01:10:45,885
I'll fix your eggs.

716
01:10:53,109 --> 01:10:56,026
Morning, miss.
Is the marshal available?

717
01:10:56,404 --> 01:11:00,152
Will you inform him there are three
murdering cowboys in town?

718
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:03,526
- Come in, Morgan. Have a coffee.
- No, thank you. There isn't time.

719
01:11:04,286 --> 01:11:06,574
- Where are they?
- Down at the Lucky Dollar.

720
01:11:07,413 --> 01:11:08,990
I better go see what they want.

721
01:11:09,165 --> 01:11:12,035
- You haven't had your breakfast.
- Just as well, miss.

722
01:11:12,209 --> 01:11:15,659
If he takes a stomach wound,
it's better if he hasn't eaten.

723
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:18,747
Keep the coffee hot,
I'll be back.

724
01:11:18,924 --> 01:11:20,038
Clay...

725
01:11:22,218 --> 01:11:25,337
- I'll make you a fresh breakfast.
- Thank you.

726
01:11:28,223 --> 01:11:31,140
I think we're going to see a finish
of the McQuowns this morning.

727
01:11:31,309 --> 01:11:33,597
Yeah, then we can move on.

728
01:11:34,104 --> 01:11:35,301
Where to?

729
01:11:35,521 --> 01:11:37,727
A fellow dropped in last night
from Palfrie City.

730
01:11:37,899 --> 01:11:41,896
Sounds like it's made for us,
booming with a gold strike,

731
01:11:42,069 --> 01:11:43,693
we ought to take a look.

732
01:11:44,154 --> 01:11:46,644
- I don't think so. Not this time.
- What do you mean?

733
01:11:48,158 --> 01:11:50,695
Jessie and I
are going to get married.

734
01:11:51,077 --> 01:11:53,069
Yeah?
When?

735
01:11:53,621 --> 01:11:56,290
In a couple of weeks,
as soon as I can get a preacher.

736
01:11:57,583 --> 01:12:00,252
I guess I'll be going to Palfrie City
alone...

737
01:12:00,418 --> 01:12:01,580
Why do you have to go?

738
01:12:01,753 --> 01:12:03,828
It's the way it's always been.

739
01:12:04,005 --> 01:12:05,796
You do ajob,
you move on to the next.

740
01:12:05,965 --> 01:12:07,957
This time, it's different.

741
01:12:08,259 --> 01:12:09,800
Blaisdell, reach.

742
01:12:12,554 --> 01:12:13,882
It's a bad morning for thinking.

743
01:12:16,015 --> 01:12:18,801
Thinking of weddings
could lead to a funeral.

744
01:12:19,727 --> 01:12:22,763
- Shall we, marshal?
- Thank you, Mr. Morgan.

745
01:12:28,401 --> 01:12:31,105
- We're with you, marshal.
- Good luck.

746
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:37,408
If I can help, marshal...

747
01:13:03,557 --> 01:13:05,134
Deputy!

748
01:13:19,696 --> 01:13:22,696
- Marshal, let me try to talk to them.
- What good would it do?

749
01:13:23,033 --> 01:13:25,191
- One of them is my brother.
- We're wasting time.

750
01:13:25,368 --> 01:13:27,858
- We have to move now, Clay.
- It's my fight, deputy.

751
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:30,492
- They called me out.
- Yes, I know that.

752
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:36,244
- All right, go ahead.
- Thanks.

753
01:13:41,966 --> 01:13:44,041
You're throwing in with us, Jonny?

754
01:13:44,218 --> 01:13:49,211
- Billy, you can't do this.
- You're a weasel, like Calhoun.

755
01:13:49,473 --> 01:13:51,346
Blaisdell saved you
from that lynch mob

756
01:13:51,516 --> 01:13:54,599
and he could've killed you
that night in the French Palace.

757
01:13:54,769 --> 01:13:56,512
There's no need for this,
no reason.

758
01:13:56,687 --> 01:13:59,094
There's reason enough,
to stand up and be a man.

759
01:13:59,273 --> 01:14:02,059
This is a free territory, and while
gunmen like Blaisdell...

760
01:14:02,234 --> 01:14:04,641
You're talking Abe's foolishness.
He'll kill you.

761
01:14:04,819 --> 01:14:06,396
I'm not scared of him.

762
01:14:07,196 --> 01:14:08,773
Are you, Johnny?

763
01:14:08,948 --> 01:14:12,067
I'm scared of dying,
just like any man,

764
01:14:12,534 --> 01:14:14,442
and so are you, Billy.

765
01:14:17,664 --> 01:14:20,997
I just want to know
what you're going to do.

766
01:14:21,542 --> 01:14:23,617
Are you going to back me,
or Blaisdell?

767
01:14:23,794 --> 01:14:26,498
I won't back him,
because you're my brother.

768
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:29,543
And I won't back you,
because you're wrong.

769
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:34,923
Pony said it'd be no use.

770
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:44,393
Come one, Blaisdell!

771
01:14:44,896 --> 01:14:46,520
Billy, don't!

772
01:15:24,014 --> 01:15:25,389
You don't have to fight me.

773
01:15:25,557 --> 01:15:28,308
You and your partners,
just ride out.

774
01:15:31,562 --> 01:15:32,641
Go for your gun.

775
01:15:33,606 --> 01:15:36,772
Don't make me kill you, boys.
Clear on out.

776
01:15:38,568 --> 01:15:40,062
Go for your gun!

777
01:15:49,662 --> 01:15:50,776
Oh, no...

778
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,621
Billy, Billy...

779
01:16:04,299 --> 01:16:05,579
I had nothing to do with it...

780
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:08,878
Start shooting,
or get out of town.

781
01:16:09,512 --> 01:16:11,800
I could've killed you,
if they hadn't done that.

782
01:16:12,557 --> 01:16:14,264
We only wanted to talk.

783
01:16:15,559 --> 01:16:17,765
Mr. Richardson,
we only wanted to talk.

784
01:16:17,936 --> 01:16:19,133
Friendly...

785
01:16:45,377 --> 01:16:46,752
Three hits.

786
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:50,869
One through the throat, two not
a finger apart, through the heart.

787
01:16:51,049 --> 01:16:54,832
I must be losing my touch.
All three were chest aimed.

788
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:03,591
Clay, you've been hit.

789
01:17:03,768 --> 01:17:06,638
Is that true,
what Friendly said?

790
01:17:06,813 --> 01:17:10,976
You saw it, Mr. Petrix.
Did it look like they came to talk?

791
01:17:11,942 --> 01:17:16,519
- Let's have nurse fix that up.
- I'll take it to Miss Jessie's.

792
01:17:16,905 --> 01:17:19,395
Doc will fix it
while I finish my breakfast.

793
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:24,652
You gotta...
You gotta...

794
01:17:24,828 --> 01:17:27,497
You gotta tell everybody, Johnny.

795
01:17:27,664 --> 01:17:29,039
Yes, Billy.

796
01:17:29,207 --> 01:17:32,456
- I didn't know.
- Yes, Billy.

797
01:17:39,717 --> 01:17:41,175
Billy...

798
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:46,673
Billy, Billy, Billy...

799
01:17:48,808 --> 01:17:50,088
Billy...

800
01:18:04,572 --> 01:18:07,525
- Evening, Mr. Marshal.
- Are you McQuown's messenger boy?

801
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:10,487
No, sir.
This poster is my work.

802
01:18:11,203 --> 01:18:13,776
Excellent lettering and spelling,
don't you think?

803
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:15,911
But not your idea, I hope.

804
01:18:16,082 --> 01:18:18,204
No. I have to give Abe
full credit for that.

805
01:18:20,252 --> 01:18:25,292
Chief of regulators. That's a fancy
title. Did you think that up?

806
01:18:25,465 --> 01:18:28,038
No, sir.
Once again, Abe gets the credit.

807
01:18:28,384 --> 01:18:32,926
He said that if Warlock
could appoint a marshal

808
01:18:33,097 --> 01:18:34,507
outside the law,

809
01:18:34,682 --> 01:18:37,635
then somebody could appoint
a chief of regulators.

810
01:18:37,809 --> 01:18:39,848
And who would that someone be?

811
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:43,103
That's be the Cowboys' Council
for the Protection of San Pablo.

812
01:18:43,272 --> 01:18:44,979
I made that title up.

813
01:18:45,232 --> 01:18:48,149
You know, this could get to be
quite a thing.

814
01:18:48,485 --> 01:18:50,109
The town of Warlock
appoints a marshal

815
01:18:50,279 --> 01:18:52,948
he kills a whole bunch
of us cowboys

816
01:18:53,114 --> 01:18:54,773
and we appoint regulators

817
01:18:54,949 --> 01:18:56,573
and we kill you

818
01:18:56,743 --> 01:18:59,613
and the town gets another marshal
who kills more cowboys

819
01:18:59,787 --> 01:19:01,411
and we appoint...

820
01:19:01,997 --> 01:19:05,994
Well, you can see how it'd go
back and forth for all time.

821
01:19:06,168 --> 01:19:08,872
It'd be like looking
into two mirrors,

822
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:10,325
put face to face.

823
01:19:11,506 --> 01:19:15,550
Marshal,
I've got so many of these.

824
01:19:15,718 --> 01:19:18,884
I wonder if you'd like to have one,
as a keepsake.

825
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:21,127
Thank you.

826
01:19:22,807 --> 01:19:24,431
For your collection.

827
01:19:29,521 --> 01:19:30,979
Clay...

828
01:19:32,149 --> 01:19:33,856
You've seen the poster, huh?

829
01:19:34,192 --> 01:19:36,267
You take the buggy, Jessie.
I'll stay and talk to Tom.

830
01:19:36,444 --> 01:19:38,103
All right, Clay.

831
01:19:38,696 --> 01:19:40,937
Maybe you better stay
and find out

832
01:19:41,115 --> 01:19:42,774
what it's like being married
to a marshal.

833
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:45,736
If he doesn't handle this right,
he'll be a dead man.

834
01:19:45,911 --> 01:19:49,030
I'm sure Clay can handle
almost anything.

835
01:19:49,205 --> 01:19:51,956
An army.
An army's coming in.

836
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:55,042
This isn't just a test,
like when we first came.

837
01:19:55,211 --> 01:19:57,962
This is a war, ma'am,
a war they have to win.

838
01:19:58,255 --> 01:20:00,579
Fifteen or twenty men
against two men.

839
01:20:01,675 --> 01:20:05,209
If you're worried about the numbers,
maybe I better handle it alone.

840
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,799
Maybe I will, Clay.

841
01:20:15,145 --> 01:20:19,011
Maybe you better go
to Palfrie City alone.

842
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:28,356
All right, Clay.
Maybe I will.

843
01:20:31,242 --> 01:20:35,155
Miss, maybe you'd like to take
a Colt in his defence.

844
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:43,538
Blaisdell...

845
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:50,458
I just want to tell you
that this is my job.

846
01:20:50,634 --> 01:20:54,465
- To keep the peace.
- How do you propose to do that?

847
01:20:54,638 --> 01:20:57,093
I'll tell McQuown
he's not to come in.

848
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,259
He'll come in all right

849
01:21:00,852 --> 01:21:05,429
and, when he does,
you're not going to fight my fight.

850
01:21:05,898 --> 01:21:10,938
I guess I'll have to. This is
the law's business, not yours.

851
01:21:15,573 --> 01:21:17,779
Nor yours, Mr. Morgan.

852
01:21:19,118 --> 01:21:22,237
Looks like our problem
is solved, Morgan.

853
01:21:22,537 --> 01:21:24,280
The law's taking over.

854
01:21:28,376 --> 01:21:31,080
- You can't mean that.
- Why not?

855
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:34,789
Let's see if Warlock is grown up
enough to take care of itself.

856
01:21:34,965 --> 01:21:38,914
Clay, if you're not the marshal,
you're nothing.

857
01:21:39,844 --> 01:21:41,421
Maybe it's time.

858
01:21:42,346 --> 01:21:44,670
Maybe we've run out of towns.

859
01:22:13,666 --> 01:22:15,622
Boys, we have a visitor.

860
01:22:19,838 --> 01:22:23,040
If it isn't Johnny Gannon,
come back to San Pablo.

861
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:27,500
Come in, Johnny. Don't stand there
like you mightn't be welcome.

862
01:22:27,678 --> 01:22:31,342
It's bad manners coming out here
with that star hanging on you.

863
01:22:31,765 --> 01:22:34,006
- Whisky, Johnny?
- No, thanks.

864
01:22:34,476 --> 01:22:35,804
Didn't come to drink.

865
01:22:37,061 --> 01:22:40,643
I came to tell you
not to come into town, Abe.

866
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:45,520
- Blaisdell sent you out here.
- No.

867
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:49,274
- Who's the message from then?
- From me.

868
01:22:51,074 --> 01:22:52,153
You.

869
01:22:53,367 --> 01:22:54,647
You're telling us.

870
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:57,952
I'm the deputy, Abe,
and I'm telling you.

871
01:22:59,623 --> 01:23:02,160
- You are posting us.
- Nobody's posted.

872
01:23:03,793 --> 01:23:08,501
But no wild bunch of "regulators"
is coming in to make trouble.

873
01:23:09,006 --> 01:23:11,164
Let me rip that star off him, Abe.

874
01:23:13,969 --> 01:23:17,918
- That's the way it is, then, Johnny?
- That's the way it is.

875
01:23:28,023 --> 01:23:31,771
What do you mean coming ton my place
telling me I'm not to go in there?

876
01:23:31,943 --> 01:23:36,153
Look out, Abe, I rode out with him.
Johnny's getting mad.

877
01:23:36,363 --> 01:23:41,569
Blaisdell will cut us down one by one
unless we go in there together.

878
01:23:41,743 --> 01:23:44,198
That'd be a thing
I'd be bound to stop too.

879
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:47,820
Yeah. Like you stopped him
from cutting Billy down.

880
01:23:47,999 --> 01:23:52,411
That was a fair fight, Abe.
At least, from Blaisdell's side.

881
01:23:52,836 --> 01:23:55,622
Billy came in to kill him.
Calhoun was set to backshoot him.

882
01:23:57,841 --> 01:24:00,129
- That's a lie.
- No, it's the truth.

883
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:04,709
I talked to Billy before the fight
and I'd swear it in any court of law.

884
01:24:06,515 --> 01:24:07,546
Yeah,

885
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:09,927
you'll swear all right,

886
01:24:10,769 --> 01:24:14,469
but, you'll swear Billy said
he only wanted to talk to Blaisdell.

887
01:24:15,273 --> 01:24:16,601
Swear it.

888
01:24:17,358 --> 01:24:19,813
Swear it here and now

889
01:24:19,985 --> 01:24:22,107
or I'll see your dirty, lying soul
in hell.

890
01:24:23,947 --> 01:24:25,986
I guess I won't, Abe.

891
01:24:30,494 --> 01:24:31,525
- Swear it.
- No.

892
01:24:31,704 --> 01:24:33,696
- Swear it, or I'll kill you.
- No.

893
01:24:35,665 --> 01:24:37,123
Go on, hit in.
Cut him up.

894
01:24:37,292 --> 01:24:38,667
- Say it.
- No.

895
01:24:38,835 --> 01:24:40,163
Say it!

896
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:02,807
Move, Johnny,
and I'll cut it off.

897
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:05,773
Don't move, Johnny.

898
01:25:07,819 --> 01:25:09,099
- Swear it.
- No.

899
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:12,237
Abe, this isn't doing any good.

900
01:25:12,615 --> 01:25:14,192
Hold off, Abe.

901
01:25:14,366 --> 01:25:16,903
Swear it, Johnny,
or I swear I will kill you.

902
01:25:17,494 --> 01:25:21,360
You better kill me, if you want
to take your regulators into Warlock.

903
01:25:21,539 --> 01:25:23,745
Otherwise, I'll stop you.

904
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:27,869
I'd sure like to see him try
to stop us, wouldn't you, Abe?

905
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:30,246
I'd like to see that, Abe.

906
01:25:31,756 --> 01:25:33,748
Stop us, then.

907
01:25:40,806 --> 01:25:42,465
We'll be in tomorrow.

908
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:49,012
Give it to him.
He can't do anything with it, anyway.

909
01:26:07,705 --> 01:26:09,246
I've warned you.

910
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:11,825
Don't come into Warlock.

911
01:26:35,062 --> 01:26:36,472
Johnny...

912
01:26:38,106 --> 01:26:40,430
I'm the law, Curley.

913
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:43,603
I'm the law.

914
01:26:55,372 --> 01:26:56,747
I'm alone.

915
01:27:01,669 --> 01:27:02,997
They coming in?

916
01:27:04,338 --> 01:27:06,413
Yes, near sundown.

917
01:27:07,174 --> 01:27:10,127
Cade says he's going to kill you
himself, Johnny.

918
01:27:11,094 --> 01:27:14,094
- I thought I saw...
- It's all right, Buck.

919
01:27:15,598 --> 01:27:19,013
Why did you come in, Curley?
Abe's gonna be mad.

920
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:24,804
I thought that if you knew
they weren't coming till sundown,

921
01:27:26,024 --> 01:27:29,143
maybe you've got business
in Bright City or something.

922
01:27:29,318 --> 01:27:32,069
I'm staying here.
Go back and tell him that.

923
01:27:32,237 --> 01:27:34,906
- That hand, against Abe and Cade?
- I'm staying.

924
01:27:35,073 --> 01:27:39,070
- My, but you're brave...
- Go back and tell them I'm here.

925
01:27:43,038 --> 01:27:45,160
You're a fool, Johnny.

926
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:47,743
Curley...

927
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:52,659
Cade gonna be doing
his usual backshooting?

928
01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:57,080
The least you'll get
is a fair fight.

929
01:27:58,010 --> 01:28:00,679
- I promise.
- Then, tell them.

930
01:28:02,848 --> 01:28:05,172
It'll be a waste of time.

931
01:28:06,517 --> 01:28:08,723
I'll stay around town and wait.

932
01:28:15,901 --> 01:28:19,518
This hand won't hold much,
especially not a Colt.

933
01:28:22,448 --> 01:28:27,654
Well, I guess I've got time
for some sleep.

934
01:28:28,328 --> 01:28:30,865
So you'll be clear-eyed
when you die.

935
01:28:31,915 --> 01:28:35,365
Doc, maybe you could give me
some laudanum for later.

936
01:28:37,336 --> 01:28:41,629
- Six drops in a glass of water.
- You're against McQuown and Blaisdell.

937
01:28:41,798 --> 01:28:43,837
You'll be killed,
you know that!

938
01:28:52,349 --> 01:28:53,724
Yes, come in.

939
01:28:54,726 --> 01:28:56,765
A lady to see you,
Mr. Blaisdell.

940
01:29:00,315 --> 01:29:01,643
Come in, Lily.

941
01:29:05,694 --> 01:29:08,896
I came to ask you for something,
a favour.

942
01:29:09,823 --> 01:29:12,313
I want Gannon for Ben Nicholson.

943
01:29:14,202 --> 01:29:17,285
- You owe me this, Clay.
- I owe nothing.

944
01:29:17,455 --> 01:29:20,325
Ben Nicholson came after me.
He called me out.

945
01:29:20,499 --> 01:29:23,867
Don't you know he went to see Morgan
first? Morgan sent him.

946
01:29:24,252 --> 01:29:25,627
I don't believe that.

947
01:29:29,257 --> 01:29:32,921
It's not important any more.
I don't care about that.

948
01:29:34,428 --> 01:29:37,464
I don't even care
about Ben Nicholson anymore.

949
01:29:38,974 --> 01:29:41,643
I only want an end
to this killing.

950
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:47,475
I hated you
and wanted you killed,

951
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:48,976
but I don't want that anymore.

952
01:29:49,858 --> 01:29:51,517
Clay, I was wondering...

953
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:56,653
Well, well, well...
Hello, Lily.

954
01:29:57,657 --> 01:30:00,776
What's she going to do,
shoot you or poison you?

955
01:30:05,831 --> 01:30:08,950
- What did she want?
- She's worried about Gannon.

956
01:30:09,209 --> 01:30:10,584
Is that all?

957
01:30:10,752 --> 01:30:12,495
- Morgan...
- Yeah?

958
01:30:13,546 --> 01:30:16,332
Did you talk to Ben Nicholson
the day he died?

959
01:30:16,507 --> 01:30:18,878
What would I have to do
with Ben Nicholson?

960
01:30:21,261 --> 01:30:23,834
- What did you tell him?
- None of your business.

961
01:30:24,722 --> 01:30:28,007
Come here again and talk to Clay
behind my back, and I'll kill you.

962
01:30:28,559 --> 01:30:32,472
I'll kill anybody who's dangerous
to Clay, even you, Lily.

963
01:30:34,064 --> 01:30:36,601
Tom, why do you do this?

964
01:30:38,401 --> 01:30:43,394
He's the only person who looked at me
and didn't see a cripple.

965
01:30:44,281 --> 01:30:45,858
Get out of here.

966
01:30:48,368 --> 01:30:51,285
Better say a prayer
for the soul of your deputy.

967
01:31:03,798 --> 01:31:05,292
Not too bad, huh?

968
01:31:06,092 --> 01:31:07,550
Not too good, either.

969
01:31:08,803 --> 01:31:12,088
I never was very fast,
but I can shoot well enough.

970
01:31:12,473 --> 01:31:14,299
Well enough
may not be good enough.

971
01:31:17,227 --> 01:31:18,424
Afternoon, deputy.

972
01:31:19,229 --> 01:31:20,888
Hello, Mr. Blaisdell.

973
01:31:21,772 --> 01:31:23,811
Guess I'll be getting
some early supper.

974
01:31:24,024 --> 01:31:27,226
Blaisdell, if you've come to offer
us help, we don't want it.

975
01:31:27,527 --> 01:31:31,191
We? Hadn't you better let Gannon
decide that?

976
01:31:31,364 --> 01:31:34,779
Don't you understand that as long as
you're here there'll be killing?

977
01:31:34,951 --> 01:31:36,777
You're a target.

978
01:31:36,952 --> 01:31:40,367
They must come after you.
Let us alone, Blaisdell.

979
01:31:40,539 --> 01:31:42,531
Come on, judge. Come on.

980
01:31:54,343 --> 01:31:57,047
- Mind if I sit?
- Go ahead.

981
01:32:06,395 --> 01:32:08,766
- How's your hand?
- It's all right.

982
01:32:18,114 --> 01:32:20,355
I remember when I first
killed a man.

983
01:32:21,325 --> 01:32:23,898
It was clear
and had to be done.

984
01:32:24,953 --> 01:32:28,902
I went home afterwards
and puked my insides out.

985
01:32:31,125 --> 01:32:33,283
I remember how clear it was.

986
01:32:34,878 --> 01:32:39,788
Afterwards, nothing was ever
clear again, except for one thing,

987
01:32:41,843 --> 01:32:45,543
to hold strictly to the rules,
only the rules matter.

988
01:32:47,681 --> 01:32:50,598
Hold onto them
like walking on eggs.

989
01:32:51,435 --> 01:32:55,218
So you know you've fought
as fair and as best you could.

990
01:32:58,274 --> 01:33:02,484
But there are things
to watch for, in yourself.

991
01:33:04,446 --> 01:33:06,237
Don't be too fast.

992
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:10,612
When there are people after you,
you know it, you're worrying,

993
01:33:12,036 --> 01:33:13,494
then, you think...

994
01:33:14,246 --> 01:33:17,495
if I don't get drawn first,
and them killed first...

995
01:33:23,171 --> 01:33:24,795
Know what I mean?

996
01:33:27,758 --> 01:33:29,038
I know.

997
01:33:33,805 --> 01:33:35,596
Can you draw
with that hand, deputy?

998
01:33:37,767 --> 01:33:39,095
I can.

999
01:33:44,523 --> 01:33:45,981
Let's see you draw.

1000
01:34:10,546 --> 01:34:12,917
This evening,
there'll be a lot against you.

1001
01:34:14,424 --> 01:34:19,085
I'd be honoured
if you'd accept my offer to help,

1002
01:34:19,262 --> 01:34:21,135
just to back you up.

1003
01:34:21,764 --> 01:34:25,677
Mr. Blaisdell, I'd like your help
more than anything in the world,

1004
01:34:26,393 --> 01:34:29,227
but it's time this town
stood on its own.

1005
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:31,809
Who knows?

1006
01:34:31,981 --> 01:34:36,441
Maybe the people of Warlock
will help by backing the law.

1007
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:38,483
I wouldn't count on that.

1008
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:44,607
But I'll be there to back you.
Will you come and have a whisky?

1009
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:48,116
No, thanks. Maybe later.

1010
01:34:49,038 --> 01:34:52,240
Right now, I've got things to do.

1011
01:35:01,966 --> 01:35:04,717
Sure is noisy out there today.

1012
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:07,667
Little boys waiting
for the circus parade.

1013
01:35:07,888 --> 01:35:09,216
How.

1014
01:35:09,973 --> 01:35:11,170
How.

1015
01:35:16,896 --> 01:35:19,979
Lily is sure gone on that deputy.

1016
01:35:20,691 --> 01:35:25,067
- Pity she won't have him long.
- Unless we take a hand.

1017
01:35:26,905 --> 01:35:28,315
Meaning what?

1018
01:35:30,199 --> 01:35:32,321
Remember that time in Gran Fort,

1019
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:36,028
those strangers had us in a hotel
with a guard?

1020
01:35:36,663 --> 01:35:41,573
Lily splashed a can of kerosene,
came running up all on fire.

1021
01:35:42,335 --> 01:35:44,410
She sure got us out of that one.

1022
01:35:46,755 --> 01:35:48,913
I think we owe her one,
Morgan.

1023
01:35:52,469 --> 01:35:55,469
That's funny,
that's very funny.

1024
01:35:55,722 --> 01:35:57,797
You've practically give up marshal
in this town.

1025
01:35:57,973 --> 01:36:01,092
The only way for you to be important
is for Gannon to die.

1026
01:36:01,268 --> 01:36:05,181
Now you want to back Gannon, so he'll
be the hero and you'll be nothing?

1027
01:36:06,481 --> 01:36:09,849
- That's very funny.
- I'm not playing king of the mountain.

1028
01:36:10,318 --> 01:36:12,606
It's not a question
of who's top or bottom.

1029
01:36:12,778 --> 01:36:15,315
It's this town holding together
against McQuown.

1030
01:36:15,489 --> 01:36:18,857
- I'm a citizen of this town...
- If you want to play second fiddle,

1031
01:36:19,034 --> 01:36:20,990
don't expect me to back you.

1032
01:36:22,036 --> 01:36:24,609
I've never asked for your help
before, Morgan.

1033
01:36:26,082 --> 01:36:28,572
Clay, how do you think
you've stayed alive this long?

1034
01:36:38,467 --> 01:36:40,044
They're here, Morgan.

1035
01:36:50,144 --> 01:36:52,634
You're not going out there
to save Gannon.

1036
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:55,221
After he's dead,
they'll beg you to protect them.

1037
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,890
Just sit down and wait, Clay.

1038
01:37:20,671 --> 01:37:22,378
Blaisdell was right.

1039
01:37:22,673 --> 01:37:25,246
He said I'd put too much on you.

1040
01:37:25,926 --> 01:37:28,843
- They're here.
- You put nothing on me.

1041
01:37:29,012 --> 01:37:32,012
It's just a time and a place
for a showdown.

1042
01:37:32,181 --> 01:37:35,466
You haven't a chance unless
you let Blaisdell help you.

1043
01:37:35,643 --> 01:37:37,101
No, judge.

1044
01:37:37,436 --> 01:37:41,267
If a deputy's worth anything, he
can't hole up when there's trouble.

1045
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:46,432
You're nothing to me, just a badge
and an office, that's all.

1046
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:49,440
Get yourself killed.
You're nothing to me.

1047
01:39:19,692 --> 01:39:21,898
Abe, I'll give you five minutes
to leave town.

1048
01:39:31,328 --> 01:39:34,910
Johnny, go for your gun,
you yellow-livered coward.

1049
01:39:35,373 --> 01:39:36,570
Go on!

1050
01:39:41,587 --> 01:39:43,081
- Hold it.
- Hold it.

1051
01:39:43,255 --> 01:39:46,089
- Drop your gun.
- Take it easy, Joe.

1052
01:40:35,592 --> 01:40:37,169
I promised you, Johnny.

1053
01:40:37,761 --> 01:40:39,883
I promised you a fair fight.

1054
01:40:42,849 --> 01:40:45,849
You regulators
are all under arrest!

1055
01:40:46,894 --> 01:40:51,638
Brown, you, Bush, Mosby,

1056
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:55,814
you're deputised to take them
into Bright City for trial.

1057
01:40:58,654 --> 01:41:01,820
Now, we'll see how far
the law can go in Warlock.

1058
01:41:08,538 --> 01:41:11,657
- You gambled and lost, Morgan.
- At least you're alive.

1059
01:41:11,833 --> 01:41:13,113
Am I?

1060
01:41:13,292 --> 01:41:15,699
Think they'd have backed you,
like they did Gannon?

1061
01:41:15,878 --> 01:41:18,119
They pay you half hoping
to see you killed.

1062
01:41:18,297 --> 01:41:21,297
Wouldn't it be better
to go down decently?

1063
01:41:21,466 --> 01:41:23,505
Isn't that what
you've always said?

1064
01:41:23,676 --> 01:41:25,798
- I've kept you from it many a time.
- Like now?

1065
01:41:25,970 --> 01:41:29,801
- Hiding in a room with a gun on me?
- No, like in Port James.

1066
01:41:29,974 --> 01:41:32,132
It was me that got
the drop on them.

1067
01:41:32,309 --> 01:41:34,431
And the Ellersons, me again.

1068
01:41:34,603 --> 01:41:37,520
And Calhoun, ready to backhoot you,
who saved your life? Me.

1069
01:41:37,689 --> 01:41:40,226
- And Bob Nicholson at the stage?
- And Bob Nicholson.

1070
01:41:44,194 --> 01:41:46,067
And Ben Nicholson, too.

1071
01:41:50,367 --> 01:41:52,026
Lily was telling the truth.

1072
01:41:52,201 --> 01:41:54,240
You used me to get back
at Lily.

1073
01:41:54,412 --> 01:41:56,570
Lily had nothing to do with it...

1074
01:41:56,747 --> 01:41:59,581
Morgan, you're telling me things
to make me kill you.

1075
01:41:59,958 --> 01:42:02,164
I'm going to Jessie's.
I'll send for my things.

1076
01:42:02,335 --> 01:42:04,623
We'll talk later.

1077
01:42:04,921 --> 01:42:06,712
Clay, you've got to face Gannon.

1078
01:42:06,881 --> 01:42:09,917
- Let him know you're in charge.
- Gannon's in charge. I'm resigning.

1079
01:42:10,092 --> 01:42:11,502
Or would you have me kill him too
because of Lily?

1080
01:42:11,677 --> 01:42:15,045
- That's not why I did those things.
- No, then why?

1081
01:42:15,222 --> 01:42:19,717
- Why? Was it for me or you?
- Not for me. You're my friend.

1082
01:42:19,892 --> 01:42:22,299
- The only friend I ever had, Clay.
- It's finished, Morgan.

1083
01:42:22,478 --> 01:42:26,095
Clay! You won't face Gannon
because you're yellow clean through.

1084
01:42:26,857 --> 01:42:29,098
Has Jessie made you like that?

1085
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:32,350
Clay, I'm not the cripple here,
you are.

1086
01:42:32,570 --> 01:42:34,858
If you don't kill Gannon,
I will.

1087
01:42:35,031 --> 01:42:36,774
I swear I will!

1088
01:42:43,205 --> 01:42:44,996
Murch... Murch!

1089
01:42:46,249 --> 01:42:47,826
Bring me some whisky.

1090
01:43:22,531 --> 01:43:24,190
"Tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow

1091
01:43:26,368 --> 01:43:28,574
creeps in this petty pace...

1092
01:43:29,996 --> 01:43:31,703
from day to day...

1093
01:43:36,376 --> 01:43:39,329
to the last syllable
of recorded time."

1094
01:43:53,975 --> 01:43:55,883
Murch, give me your Colts.

1095
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:00,186
- You're been drinking...
- I said give me your Colts.

1096
01:44:18,747 --> 01:44:22,080
I'm the black rattlesnake
of the whole territory.

1097
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:25,157
I'll kill anything that moves.

1098
01:44:25,586 --> 01:44:27,708
Just sit still, or die.

1099
01:44:29,089 --> 01:44:32,872
And, if you move,
you crawl.

1100
01:44:42,851 --> 01:44:44,261
Who wants to die?

1101
01:44:44,853 --> 01:44:47,390
I got lightening in both hands,
I'm just spoiling for a fight.

1102
01:44:53,361 --> 01:44:55,519
I'll kill anything that moves!

1103
01:44:59,825 --> 01:45:04,533
I've killed 45 men, and tonight
I'm going to run up that score.

1104
01:45:10,626 --> 01:45:12,832
Where's that brave deputy?

1105
01:45:14,004 --> 01:45:16,079
That great cowboy killer.

1106
01:45:17,006 --> 01:45:18,547
What's he doing?
Hiding?

1107
01:45:20,426 --> 01:45:21,706
Gannon!

1108
01:45:27,933 --> 01:45:31,882
I'm the all time
champion cowboy killer!

1109
01:45:39,568 --> 01:45:41,690
Sorry, deputy,
drop it right there.

1110
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:47,066
- Get inside the cage.
- What is this?

1111
01:45:47,241 --> 01:45:50,989
- Inside.
- What do you think you're doing?

1112
01:45:51,870 --> 01:45:55,155
You're a brave man,
but Tom Morgan is my responsibility.

1113
01:45:59,294 --> 01:46:00,538
Gannon!

1114
01:46:01,170 --> 01:46:03,874
Crawl out of your hole,
you yellow-belly.

1115
01:46:04,423 --> 01:46:06,379
I'll run you out of town.

1116
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:13,054
Gannon,
do I have to come in after you?

1117
01:46:13,264 --> 01:46:14,722
Morgan!

1118
01:46:17,435 --> 01:46:18,763
Morgan.

1119
01:46:26,609 --> 01:46:28,019
Hello, Clay.

1120
01:46:37,244 --> 01:46:39,817
- Let me kill him, Clay.
- No, Morgan.

1121
01:46:40,079 --> 01:46:42,616
Why? Because you think
you owe Lily?

1122
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:46,288
This isn't a game you can cheat
and make a fraud of.

1123
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:48,499
I'm going to have to
run you out of town.

1124
01:46:55,426 --> 01:46:57,252
Then, I won.

1125
01:46:57,803 --> 01:47:02,013
Clay, you run me out of town,
I'll go like a lamb.

1126
01:47:03,392 --> 01:47:07,175
You'll be a hero again.
That's all I want.

1127
01:47:09,105 --> 01:47:11,642
- I've won.
- All right, you've won.

1128
01:47:12,316 --> 01:47:14,985
We'll play this out till the end,
just as you wanted.

1129
01:47:15,152 --> 01:47:17,607
I'm telling you to leave town.

1130
01:47:18,447 --> 01:47:19,727
All right.

1131
01:47:20,657 --> 01:47:23,361
- I'll see you in Palfrie City.
- No, you won't.

1132
01:47:23,534 --> 01:47:26,404
- You'll be there.
- No, Morgan.

1133
01:47:31,208 --> 01:47:32,951
I'll be waiting for you.

1134
01:47:34,377 --> 01:47:36,416
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1135
01:47:36,921 --> 01:47:38,996
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1136
01:48:01,818 --> 01:48:05,862
- I'll tell you something, Clay.
- What is it, Morgan?

1137
01:48:07,406 --> 01:48:11,403
I'm better than you.
I've always been better.

1138
01:48:13,495 --> 01:48:17,871
I can beat you, Clay.
You hit it.

1139
01:48:19,542 --> 01:48:21,534
And you better hit it fast.

1140
01:48:32,762 --> 01:48:34,469
I won, Clay.

1141
01:48:35,556 --> 01:48:36,836
I won.

1142
01:48:52,404 --> 01:48:54,562
Get your hands off him.

1143
01:49:51,373 --> 01:49:52,867
Say something.

1144
01:49:56,502 --> 01:49:58,043
Say something!

1145
01:50:02,591 --> 01:50:05,959
- He'd have killed somebody.
- He broke my arm.

1146
01:50:06,553 --> 01:50:09,043
- He was after trouble.
- What are you worth?

1147
01:50:10,306 --> 01:50:12,594
He was out to kill somebody,
marshal.

1148
01:50:13,350 --> 01:50:16,303
- Who? You?
- Might've been me.

1149
01:50:17,354 --> 01:50:20,473
- What are you worth?
- The Lord delivers.

1150
01:50:23,359 --> 01:50:24,556
Judge me.

1151
01:50:26,362 --> 01:50:28,983
You judged him, judge me now.

1152
01:50:30,782 --> 01:50:32,240
Judge me.

1153
01:50:33,952 --> 01:50:35,529
What will you do?

1154
01:50:35,745 --> 01:50:38,152
Kill all of us for your pain?

1155
01:50:49,549 --> 01:50:52,964
I've had too much of you.
Crawl for it.

1156
01:50:53,802 --> 01:50:56,968
Crawl past him.
He was a man, not all talk.

1157
01:51:12,944 --> 01:51:14,568
Take your hats off.

1158
01:51:17,532 --> 01:51:19,156
Take your hats off!

1159
01:51:21,493 --> 01:51:23,366
Now, you can sing.

1160
01:51:28,875 --> 01:51:30,499
Sing!

1161
01:52:03,989 --> 01:52:05,483
Stand back.

1162
01:52:30,137 --> 01:52:31,796
Johnny, he'll kill you.

1163
01:52:42,565 --> 01:52:44,142
Stand back, deputy.

1164
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:48,352
Sorry, Blaisdell, it's time.

1165
01:52:48,528 --> 01:52:50,816
- Time?
- You can't stay here.

1166
01:52:51,322 --> 01:52:54,655
Trouble and death follow you.
Warlock's had enough of both.

1167
01:52:54,826 --> 01:52:57,447
- Are you running me out of town?
- No.

1168
01:52:57,661 --> 01:53:00,330
I'm just saying I'll have to
arrest you in the morning,

1169
01:53:00,497 --> 01:53:02,240
so I'm asking you to get out
before.

1170
01:53:02,416 --> 01:53:05,202
Nobody tells me that.
I come and go as I please.

1171
01:53:05,376 --> 01:53:09,704
No longer, Mr. Blaisdell.
I'll have to come after you.

1172
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:11,919
Come shooting, if you do.

1173
01:53:12,299 --> 01:53:14,457
- I'll do that.
- You'll have to.

1174
01:53:58,798 --> 01:54:03,008
I told Blaisdell
he's to get out of town by morning.

1175
01:54:04,804 --> 01:54:06,179
I heard.

1176
01:54:07,723 --> 01:54:09,382
And is he going?

1177
01:54:11,601 --> 01:54:12,845
No.

1178
01:54:39,376 --> 01:54:43,586
What do you want?
Your whole life in one night?

1179
01:54:51,428 --> 01:54:52,672
Johnny.

1180
01:55:24,624 --> 01:55:25,999
Clay.

1181
01:55:27,710 --> 01:55:29,583
I've been looking for you.

1182
01:55:30,754 --> 01:55:32,829
Have you been here
all this time?

1183
01:55:33,632 --> 01:55:38,376
- Jessie, why did he do it?
- I don't know.

1184
01:55:41,430 --> 01:55:45,178
- Clay, what are you going to do?
- Yesterday...

1185
01:55:47,269 --> 01:55:51,729
Was it only yesterday? I told him
he was nothing without me.

1186
01:55:53,608 --> 01:55:55,814
Maybe I'm nothing
without him.

1187
01:55:56,277 --> 01:55:57,984
That's foolish.

1188
01:56:00,072 --> 01:56:04,151
We had a council meeting and everyone
agreed that if you wanted to stay

1189
01:56:04,325 --> 01:56:07,111
we could go to the deputy,
I'm sure there'd be no problem.

1190
01:56:07,286 --> 01:56:09,408
What would I do here?

1191
01:56:10,539 --> 01:56:12,447
Stay with me, as we planned.

1192
01:56:12,624 --> 01:56:15,957
- What would I do?
- I don't know.

1193
01:56:17,045 --> 01:56:19,962
Whatever you planned on doing
before this happened.

1194
01:56:20,882 --> 01:56:23,123
I never saw past this morning.

1195
01:56:23,759 --> 01:56:26,214
I suppose I figured
Morgan and I...

1196
01:56:28,221 --> 01:56:29,465
What now?

1197
01:56:31,099 --> 01:56:35,511
Shall I clerk in Richardson's store?
Sell needles to old ladies?

1198
01:56:36,145 --> 01:56:38,931
Should I take over McQuown's
and nurse calves?

1199
01:56:39,732 --> 01:56:42,401
Become a miner
and live in darkness?

1200
01:56:43,777 --> 01:56:46,813
If you loved me,
none of these things would be bad.

1201
01:56:48,448 --> 01:56:50,025
Jessie, come with me.

1202
01:56:50,491 --> 01:56:52,649
We'll go to Palfrie City.
I can become the marshal there.

1203
01:56:54,161 --> 01:56:57,280
- To another town, and another...
- Why not?

1204
01:56:58,373 --> 01:57:01,207
It's the way I've lived,
it's the way I'll always live.

1205
01:57:01,376 --> 01:57:03,249
Times are changing, sure,

1206
01:57:03,419 --> 01:57:05,327
but there'll be enough towns
to last my lifetime.

1207
01:57:06,255 --> 01:57:09,588
I'm not Morgan.
I can't back you.

1208
01:57:09,966 --> 01:57:12,883
I can't even hold a Colt,
much less fire one.

1209
01:57:13,052 --> 01:57:16,005
Who'll kill the backshooters
in Palfrie City?

1210
01:57:20,809 --> 01:57:22,717
Maybe I'll have to find
another Morgan.

1211
01:57:43,121 --> 01:57:44,200
Morning.

1212
01:58:01,387 --> 01:58:06,262
There's the key,
the judge has got the other one.

1213
01:58:15,733 --> 01:58:17,191
Take care of it.

1214
01:58:20,570 --> 01:58:24,982
People are out.
Funny how they find out about things.

1215
01:58:26,367 --> 01:58:27,647
Yeah...

1216
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:33,324
Well...

1217
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:38,498
- I guess it's about time.
- Chilly out.

1218
01:58:40,838 --> 01:58:42,082
Yeah.
