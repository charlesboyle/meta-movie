1
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,248
Where are you? Come out!

2
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,417
Come out!

3
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,253
Come on out.

4
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:32,341
I'm coming to get you.

5
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,679
Where are you, you little rascal?
I'm coming to get you.

6
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,476
Where is my little birthday girl?

7
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,646
I'm going to gobble her up
when I find her.

8
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,525
I'm going to eat you. I am.

9
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,947
Fergus, no weapons on the table.

10
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,325
Can I shoot an arrow?
Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I?

11
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,702
Please? Can I?

12
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,789
Not with that. Why not

13
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,207
use your very own?

14
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,627
Happy birthday, my wee darling!

15
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,508
Now, there's a good girl.

16
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,177
Draw all the way back now
to your cheek. That's right.

17
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,472
Keep both eyes open.

18
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,308
And, loose!

19
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,729
- I missed.
- Go and fetch it, then.

20
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:32,026
A bow, Fergus? She's a lady.

21
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:33,986
You!

22
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,441
A will-o'-the-wisp.

23
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,869
They are real.

24
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,337
Merida, come along, sweetheart.

25
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,673
- We're leaving now.
- I saw a wisp.

26
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,760
- I saw a wisp.
- A wisp?

27
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:45,183
You know, some say that
will-o'-the-wisps lead you to your fate.

28
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,727
Aye. Or an arrow.

29
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,813
Come on, let's be off before we see
a dancing Tatty Bogle.

30
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,316
Or a giant having a jigger
in the bluebells.

31
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,276
Your father doesn't believe in magic.

32
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,820
Well, he should. Because it's true.

33
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,533
Mor'du! Elinor, run!

34
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,827
Sire!

35
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,337
Come on, you!

36
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,978
Some say our destiny
is tied to the land

37
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,565
as much a part of us as we are of it.

38
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:41,697
Others say fate is woven together
like a cloth.

39
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,535
So that one's destiny intertwines
with many others.

40
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:55,544
It's the one thing we search for
or fight to change.

41
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,131
Some never find it.

42
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,720
But there are some who are led.

43
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,478
The story of how my father lost his leg

44
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,897
to the demon bear Mor'du
became legend.

45
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,820
I became a sister
to three new brothers.

46
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,156
The princes.
Hamish, Hubert and Harris.

47
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,951
Wee devils, more like.

48
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,536
They get away with murder.

49
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,914
I can never get away with anything.

50
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,793
I'm the princess.

51
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,547
I'm the example.

52
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,593
I've got duties, responsibilities,
expectations.

53
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,470
My whole life is planned out,

54
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,888
preparing for the day I become...

55
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,016
Well, my mother.

56
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,436
She's in charge
of every single day of my life.

57
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:59,859
"Aye, Robin, Jolly Robin,
and thou shalt know of mine."

58
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,110
Project!

59
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,404
"And thou shalt know of mine!"

60
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,490
Enunciate. You must be understood
from anywhere in the room,

61
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,284
or it's all for naught.

62
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,287
- This is all for naught.
- I heard that!

63
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,496
From the top.

64
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,708
A princess must be knowledgeable
about her kingdom.

65
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,170
She does not doodle.

66
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,799
That's a C, dear.

67
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,475
A princess does not chortle.

68
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,643
Does not stuff her gob!

69
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,395
Rises early.

70
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,230
...is compassionate...

71
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,857
...patient, cautious,

72
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:40,900
clean.

73
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:47,990
And above all, a princess
strives for... Well, perfection.

74
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,160
But every once in a while,

75
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:56,415
there's a day
when I don't have to be a princess.

76
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,045
No lessons, no expectations.

77
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,506
A day where anything can happen.

78
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:08,094
A day I can change my fate.

79
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,510
I'm starving. You hungry too, Angus?

80
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,014
Oats it is, then.

81
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,893
Good day, Princess.

82
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,853
I cannot find the salt.
Where did you put it?

83
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,189
It was over there a minute ago,
the last time I looked at it.

84
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:30,903
And then, out of nowhere,
the biggest bear you've ever seen!

85
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,948
His hide littered with the weapons
of fallen warriors.

86
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,660
His face scarred with one dead eye.

87
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,204
I drew my sword and...

88
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,083
One swipe, his sword shattered.

89
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,294
Then "chomp"! Dad's leg was clean off.

90
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,964
Down the monster's throat it went.

91
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,967
That's my favorite part.

92
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,720
Mor'du has never been seen since,

93
00:09:56,805 --> 00:10:01,976
and is roaming the wilds
waiting his chance of revenge.

94
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,520
Let him return.

95
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,313
I'll finish what
I guddled in the first place.

96
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,442
Merida, a princess does not place
her weapons on the table.

97
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,779
Mum! It's just my bow.

98
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,824
A princess should not have weapons
in my opinion.

99
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,367
Leave her be.

100
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,203
Princess or not,
learning to fight is essential.

101
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,081
Mum?
You'll never guess what I did today.

102
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,458
I climbed the Crone's Tooth,

103
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,876
and drank from the Fire Falls.

104
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,795
Fire Falls?

105
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,674
They say only the ancient kings
were brave enough to drink the fire.

106
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,803
- What did you do, dear?
- Nothing, Mum.

107
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,138
Hungry, aren't we?

108
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,598
- Mum!
- You'll get dreadful collywobbles.

109
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,685
Oh, Fergus, will you look at
your daughter's plate?

110
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,687
So what?

111
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,315
- You great...
- Don't let them lick...

112
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,649
Boys, you're naughty.

113
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,818
Don't just play with your haggis.

114
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,821
How do you know you don't like it,

115
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,990
if you won't try it?

116
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,908
That's just a wee sheep's stomach.

117
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,702
It's delicious.

118
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,913
- My lady.
- Thank you, Maudie.

119
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,248
You're getting too big, the two of you.

120
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,673
From the Lords Macintosh,
MacGuffin and Dingwall.

121
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,133
Their responses, no doubt.

122
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,718
Aye, aye!

123
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,803
Hey, hey!

124
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,349
Stay out of my food,
you greedy mongrels.

125
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,143
Chew on that, you manky dogs!

126
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,395
Fergus?

127
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,107
They've all accepted.

128
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,987
Who's accepted what, Mother?

129
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,281
Boys, you are excused.

130
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,162
Hey!

131
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,999
What did I do now?

132
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,418
Your father has something
to discuss with you.

133
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:54,880
Fergus?

134
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,389
Merida.

135
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:11,063
The lords are presenting
their sons as suitors for your betrothal.

136
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,982
- What?
- The clans have accepted.

137
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,985
- Dad!
- What? I...

138
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,405
You... She... Elinor?

139
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,990
Honestly, Merida, I don't know why
you're reacting this way.

140
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,993
This year,
each clan will present a suitor

141
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,162
to compete in the games for your hand.

142
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,082
I suppose a princess
just does what she's told?

143
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,709
A princess does not raise her voice.

144
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,296
Merida, this is what you've been
preparing for your whole life.

145
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,259
No, it's what you've been preparing
me for my whole life.

146
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,594
I won't go through with it.
You can't make me.

147
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,599
Merida!

148
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,021
Boys!

149
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,904
Mother. Suitors? Marriage?

150
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,407
Once there was an ancient kingdom...

151
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,034
Mum!

152
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,703
Ancient kingdom.

153
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,830
Its name long forgotten,

154
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,460
ruled by a wise and fair king
who was much beloved.

155
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:19,965
And when he grew old he divided
the kingdom among his four sons,

156
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:24,428
that they should be the pillars
on which the peace of the land rested.

157
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,809
But the oldest prince
wanted to rule the land for himself.

158
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,480
He followed his own path
and the kingdom fell

159
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,650
to war, and chaos and ruin.

160
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,527
That's a nice story.

161
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,489
It's not just a story, Merida.

162
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,241
Legends are lessons.
They ring with truths.

163
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,659
Mum.

164
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,912
I would advise you
to make your peace with this.

165
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,872
The clans are coming
to present their suitors.

166
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,416
- It's not fair.
- Merida.

167
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,336
It's marriage.
It's not the end of the world.

168
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,639
- You're muttering.
- I don't mutter.

169
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,518
Aye, you do. You mutter, lass,
when something's troubling you.

170
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,686
I blame you. Stubbornness.

171
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,356
It's entirely from your side of the family.

172
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,441
I take it the talk didn't go too well, then?

173
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,110
I don't know what to do.

174
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,197
- Speak to her, dear.
- I do speak to her.

175
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,575
- She just doesn't listen.
- Come on, now.

176
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,036
Pretend I'm Merida. Speak to me.

177
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
What would you say?

178
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,707
I can't do this.

179
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,459
Sure you can.

180
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,128
There, there. That's my queen.

181
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,673
Right, here we go.

182
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:43,966
"I don't want to get married.

183
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,510
"I want to stay single
and let my hair flow in the wind

184
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:51,056
"as I ride through the glen
firing arrows into the sunset."

185
00:14:56,104 --> 00:15:00,899
Merida, all this work,
all the time spent preparing you,

186
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:04,903
schooling you,
giving you everything we never had.

187
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:08,323
I ask you, what do you expect us to do?

188
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,493
Call off the gathering.
Would that kill them?

189
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,911
You're the queen.

190
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:16,290
You can just tell the lords
the princess is not ready for this.

191
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:20,127
In fact, she might not ever be ready
for this, so that's that.

192
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:24,214
Good day to you. We'll expect your
declarations of war in the morning.

193
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,926
I understand this must all seem unfair.

194
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,387
Even I had reservations
when I faced betrothal.

195
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,890
But we can't just run away
from who we are.

196
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,602
I don't want my life to be over.

197
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,936
I want my freedom!

198
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,356
But are you willing to pay the price
your freedom will cost?

199
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,483
I'm not doing any of this to hurt you.

200
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:49,072
If you could just try to see what I do,
I do out of love.

201
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:52,117
But it's my life, it's...

202
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,286
I'm just not ready.

203
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,246
I think you'd see, if you could just...

204
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,458
I think I could make you understand
if you would just...

205
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,043
...listen.
...listen.

206
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,549
I swear, Angus,
this isn't going to happen.

207
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,177
Not if I have any say in it.

208
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:30,072
MacGuffin!

209
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,868
- Dingwall!
- Dingwall!

210
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,623
- Macintosh!
- Macintosh!

211
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,972
You look absolutely beautiful.

212
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,557
I can't breathe.

213
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,643
Shush! Give us a turn.

214
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,313
I can't move.

215
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,440
It's too tight.

216
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,318
It's perfect.

217
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,208
- Merida?
- Mum?

218
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,130
Just...

219
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,009
Remember to smile.

220
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,525
Aye, they're coming.

221
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,111
Places, everyone. Places.

222
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,338
I look fine, woman! Leave me be!

223
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,007
My Lord!

224
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,302
I want to announce the arrival
of the lords...

225
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,429
Who goes there? Who goes there?

226
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,156
Boy!

227
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,252
So, here we are,

228
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,214
- the four clans.
- Aye.

229
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,800
Gathering...

230
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,052
...for...

231
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,889
...the presentation of the suitors.
...the presentation of the suitors.

232
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,642
Clan Macintosh.

233
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,977
Macintosh!

234
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:09,731
Your Majesty,
I present my heir and scion,

235
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,235
who defended our land
from the northern invaders,

236
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,489
and with his own sword, Stab Blooder,

237
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,991
vanquished 1,000 foes.

238
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,077
Macintosh!

239
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,955
Clan MacGuffin!

240
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,706
MacGuffin!

241
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,128
Good Majesty, I present my eldest son,

242
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,631
who scuttled the Viking longships

243
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:39,427
and with his bare hands
vanquished 2,000 foes.

244
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,680
MacGuffin!

245
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,809
Clan Dingwall.

246
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,269
Dingwall!

247
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,982
I present my only son

248
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:57,571
who was besieged by 10,000 Romans

249
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,908
and he took out a whole armada
singlehandedly.

250
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,618
With one arm, he was...

251
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,414
With one arm he was steering the ship

252
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:10,625
and with the other
he held his mighty sword

253
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,420
and struck down a whole attacking fleet.

254
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,881
- Lies!
- What? I heard that.

255
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,133
Go on. Say it to my face.

256
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,219
Or are ye scared,
simpering jackanapes,

257
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,430
afraid to muss your pretty hair?

258
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,766
- At least we have hair.
- And all our teeth.

259
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,311
If he was a wee bit closer...

260
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:35,025
And we don't hide under bridges,
you grumpy old troll.

261
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,447
You want to laugh, huh?

262
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,657
Wee Dingwall!

263
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,119
Get off me!

264
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,592
Nut 'em! Nut 'em! That's the way to...

265
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,511
All right.

266
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,890
Shut it!

267
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:14,064
Now, that's all done.
You've had your go at each other.

268
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,941
Show a little decorum.

269
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,944
And no more fighting.

270
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,437
You want a fresh one?

271
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:01,444
Crivens, you're fierce.

272
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,862
I didn't start it. It was...

273
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,615
My lady Queen, I feel terrible.
My humblest apologies.

274
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,285
- We mean no disrespect.
- I'm sorry, love, I didn't... But...

275
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,496
Yes, dear.

276
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,331
Now, where were we?

277
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:17,085
Yes. In accordance with our laws,

278
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,587
by the rights of our heritage,

279
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,966
only the firstborn of each
of the great leaders

280
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,136
- may be presented as champion.
- Firstborn?

281
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,182
And thus compete for the hand
of the Princess of Dun Broch.

282
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,936
To win the fair maiden
they must prove their worth

283
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:38,815
by feats of strength or arms
in the games.

284
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:43,486
It is customary that the challenge
be determined by the princess herself.

285
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,280
Archery! Archery.

286
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:51,578
I choose archery.

287
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,498
Let the games begin!

288
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,856
Pull!

289
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,291
I'll just take one.

290
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:48,510
Now, I have told you,
you're not allowed...

291
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,241
It's time!

292
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,205
- Archers, to your marks!
- Aye, archers to your marks.

293
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,958
And may the lucky arrow find its target.

294
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,220
Oi! Get on with it.

295
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,733
I bet he wishes he was tossing cabers.

296
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,736
Or holding up bridges.

297
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,831
At least you hit the target, son.

298
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,042
That's attractive.

299
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,923
- I got it!
- Good arm.

300
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:12,218
And such lovely flowing locks.

301
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:13,678
- Fergus.
- What?

302
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,606
Wee lamb.

303
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,739
Come on! Shoot, boy!

304
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,952
Well done, lad! Well done.

305
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,625
Feast your eyes!

306
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,961
That's my boy.

307
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:51,257
Well, that's just grand now, isn't it?

308
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,801
- Guess who's coming to dinner?
- Fergus.

309
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:57,013
By the way, hope you don't mind
being called Lady...

310
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,773
I am Merida.

311
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,443
Firstborn descendant
of Clan Dun Broch.

312
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,696
And I'll be shooting for my own hand.

313
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,992
What are you doing?

314
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,872
Merida!

315
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,832
Curse this dress!

316
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,716
Merida, stop this!

317
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,765
Don't you dare loose another arrow.

318
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,277
Merida, I forbid it.

319
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,268
Michty me!
I've just about had enough of you, lass!

320
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,479
- You're the one that wants me to...
- You embarrassed them.

321
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,398
- You embarrassed me.
- I followed the rules.

322
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,358
You don't know what you've done!

323
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,986
- Just don't care how I...
- It'll be fire and sword if it's not set right.

324
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,655
- Just listen!
- I am the Queen!

325
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,240
You listen to me!

326
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,659
This is so unfair!

327
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,494
Unfair?

328
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,580
You're never there for me.

329
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,333
This whole marriage is what you want.

330
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,502
Do you ever bother
to ask what I want? No.

331
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,505
You walk around telling me what to do,
what not to do,

332
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,091
trying to make me be like you.

333
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,469
Well, I'm not going to be like you.

334
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,220
You're acting like a child.

335
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,140
And you're a beast.

336
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,142
- That's what you are!
- Merida.

337
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,519
- I'll never be like you.
- No, stop that!

338
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,855
I'd rather die than be like you!

339
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,780
Merida, you are a princess,

340
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,783
- and I expect you to act like one.
- Mum!

341
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:34,545
Merida!

342
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,423
Oh, dear.

343
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,763
Oh, no. What have I done?

344
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,760
Angus!

345
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,559
Come on, Angus.

346
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,894
Angus!

347
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,195
Why would the wisps lead me here?

348
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,222
Look around.

349
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,474
You holler if you see anything you like.

350
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,977
Everything is half off.

351
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,485
- Who are you?
- Just a humble woodcarver.

352
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,114
I don't understand...

353
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:51,075
See anything you like?

354
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:55,288
Perhaps a touch of whimsy
to brighten any dank chamber?

355
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,957
But the will-o'-the-wisps, they...

356
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,001
This is one of a kind!

357
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,003
I'll make you a deal for this rare prize.

358
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,756
Your broom!

359
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,094
- It was sweeping by itself.
- That's ridiculous.

360
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,847
Wood cannot be imbued
with magical properties.

361
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,309
I should know. I'm a... Whittler.

362
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,185
Of wood.

363
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:23,774
How about this conversation starter?
It's made of yew wood.

364
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,027
Tough as stone.

365
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,614
That's stuffed.

366
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,950
- Staring is rude.
- The crow's talking!

367
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,327
That's not all I can do.

368
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:45,963
- You're a witch!
- Woodcarver.

369
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,257
That's why the wisps led me here.

370
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,926
- Woodcarver!
- You'll change my fate!

371
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,804
- Woodcarver!
- You see, it's my mother.

372
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,974
I'm not a witch!
Too many unsatisfied customers.

373
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:04,231
If you're not going to buy anything,
get out.

374
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,568
- No! The wisps led me here!
- I don't care!

375
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:13,658
- Get out! Shoo! Get! Be gone with you!
- I'll buy it all.

376
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,243
- What? What was that?
- Every carving.

377
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,412
Well...

378
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,750
And how are you going
to pay for that, sweetie?

379
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,918
With this.

380
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,008
Oh, my, that's lovely, that is.

381
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:32,510
That would set us up for months.

382
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:41,268
Every carving and one spell.

383
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,398
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

384
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:49,276
I want a spell to change my mum.

385
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,612
That'll change my fate.

386
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,114
Done!

387
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,409
Where are you going?

388
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,953
There.

389
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,121
What are you doing?

390
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:03,040
You never conjure where you carve.

391
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,792
Very important.

392
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:11,507
The last time I did this
was for a prince.

393
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,927
Easy on the eyes. Tight pants.

394
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,597
He demanded I give him
the strength of ten men.

395
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,934
And he gave me this for a spell.

396
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,687
A spell that would change his fate.

397
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,023
And did he get what he was after?

398
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:33,654
Yes. And made off with an especially
attractive mahogany cheese board.

399
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,323
Now, what do I need?

400
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,451
Just a little bit of this.

401
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:48,753
That'll do.

402
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:12,526
And now let's see. What have we here?

403
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,617
Hey!

404
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,453
A cake?

405
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,539
- You don't want it?
- Yes! I want it.

406
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:30,461
You're sure if I give this to my mum,

407
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,254
it will change my fate?

408
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:37,468
Trust me. It'll do the trick, dearie.

409
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:43,015
Expect delivery of your purchase
within a fortnight.

410
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,145
What was that thing about the spell?

411
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,816
Did you say something about

412
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,902
the spell?

413
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:02,910
Mor'du, Mor'du, now the time has
come for all of us to slaughter you

414
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,662
Hooray!

415
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,539
Mor'du, Mor'du...

416
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,934
- Merida.
- Mum!

417
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,773
- I've been worried sick.
- You... You were?

418
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,401
I didn't know where you'd gone
or when you'd come back.

419
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:38,404
I didn't know what to think.
Look at your dress.

420
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:42,116
Angus threw me. But I'm not hurt.

421
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,786
Well, you're home now,
so that's the end of it.

422
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:50,124
- Honestly?
- I've pacified the lords for now.

423
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,168
Your father's out there
"entertaining" them.

424
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,045
Come taste my blade, you manky bear

425
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,714
For gobbling up my leg

426
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,885
I'll hunt you, then I'll skin you,
hang your noggin on a peg...

427
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:07,141
Of course, we both know
a decision still has to be made.

428
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,898
- What's this?
- It's a peace offering.

429
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:17,151
I made it. For you. Special.

430
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,112
You made this for me?

431
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,537
Interesting flavor.

432
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:29,955
How do you feel?

433
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,416
- What... What is that?
- Different?

434
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,879
Tart and gamy.

435
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,966
Have you changed your mind at all
about the marriage and all that?

436
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,177
That's better.

437
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,846
Now, why don't we go
upstairs to the lords

438
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,766
and put this whole kerfuffle to rest?

439
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,778
- Mother?
- I'm woozy suddenly.

440
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,322
My head's spinning like a top.

441
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:07,159
- Mum!
- Suddenly I'm not so well.

442
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,038
How do you feel
about the marriage now?

443
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,166
Merida! Just take me to my room.

444
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,794
All right, that's fine.
That's just fine.

445
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:20,714
A little to the left. That's good.
A wee bit to the left. That's good.

446
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,424
It's good enough.

447
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:25,427
Now, clear out of there, boys.
I don't want you to spoil my shot.

448
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,179
- What?
- My lady Queen.

449
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,182
We've been waiting patiently.

450
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:35,229
Milords, I am out of sorts
at the moment.

451
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,108
But you shall have your answer.

452
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,778
Presently.

453
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,739
Now, if you'll excuse us.

454
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,951
Elinor, look!

455
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:51,203
It's Mor'du!

456
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,665
Elinor? Are you all right, dear?

457
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,500
Fine. I'm fine.

458
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,877
Go about avenging your leg.

459
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,213
Aye. You heard her, lads.

460
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:05,426
I dream about the perfect way
to make this devil die.

461
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,599
Just take all the time you need
to getting yourself right, Mum.

462
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:16,645
Then maybe in a bit you might have
something new to say on the marriage.

463
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,148
What was in that cake?

464
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:20,816
Cake.

465
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,361
Mum?

466
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:26,989
So I'll just tell them
the wedding's off, then?

467
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,038
Mum?

468
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,149
Bear!

469
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:37,976
Mum?

470
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:42,981
You're... You're a bear!

471
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,527
Why a bear?

472
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,697
That scaffy witch
gave me a gammy spell.

473
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,159
It's not my fault.

474
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,161
I didn't ask her
to change you into a bear.

475
00:40:56,246 --> 00:41:01,041
I just wanted her to change you.

476
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,383
Did you hear that?

477
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,718
Something's not right.

478
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:18,392
There's no point in having a go at me.
The witch is to blame.

479
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,602
Goggly old hag.

480
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,981
Eyes all over the place.

481
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,733
Unbelievable.

482
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,821
I'll get her to fix this.

483
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,532
Why do I always get blamed
for everything? It's just not fair.

484
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,621
Everybody, follow me.

485
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,707
And keep a sharp eye.

486
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,502
Here we go.
Another hunt through the castle.

487
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:47,421
But we haven't had dessert yet.

488
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,761
I have no idea.

489
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,473
Mum, you can't go out there.

490
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,810
Mum! Wait!

491
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:07,316
What are you doing?
Dad. The Bear King?

492
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,568
If he so much as sees you, you're dead.

493
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:13,530
Another one of
your entertainments to bore us to death!

494
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:15,032
And what exactly are we after...

495
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,158
Mum!

496
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:18,035
...my liege?

497
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,288
Best to humor him.
He is, after all, the King.

498
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,586
He's like a hound with that nose of his.

499
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,881
Mum, wait.

500
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,382
We have to...

501
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,801
Follow me.

502
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,678
Stop.

503
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:37,804
Stop!

504
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,352
You're covered with fur.

505
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,103
You're not naked.

506
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,064
It's not like anyone's gonna see you.

507
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:56,073
Now you've done it.

508
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,244
Maudie!

509
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,038
Just calm down, lass. What is it?

510
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,290
Spit it out, Maudie!

511
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,167
A bear!

512
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:08,877
I knew it!

513
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,964
Would you just listen to me?

514
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,883
We can't go this way. You'll be seen.

515
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:16,260
Quick! This way!

516
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:37,614
Mum?

517
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:59,594
A witch turned Mum into a bear.
It's not my fault.

518
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,055
We've got to get out of the castle.
I need your help.

519
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:04,474
All right.

520
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,811
You can have my desserts for two...
Three weeks.

521
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,565
Okay. Fine. A year.

522
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,323
Did you hear that?

523
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,332
There it goes!

524
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,502
Come on, lads!

525
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,511
There it goes!

526
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,444
Come on, Mum.

527
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,366
Think we should lay a trap?

528
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,159
Try shutting yours!

529
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,539
There he is!

530
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,637
I'm sure it went this way.

531
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,263
You can see my house from here.

532
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:27,265
It must have sprouted wings.

533
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,519
Was carried away by a giant birdy.

534
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:33,814
- A dragon, perhaps.
- Bear in the castle!

535
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,857
Doesn't make sense.
It cannot open doors.

536
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:37,818
He's got big giant paws!

537
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:39,361
Let's just get inside.

538
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:44,241
- It's locked.
- Dingwall was the last up.

539
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,493
I propped it open with a stick.

540
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:56,336
What did you see, Maudie?
Just spit it out, Maudie.

541
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:59,548
For goodness' sakes, Maudie,
would you get a grip?

542
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,179
Maudie, honey, come here!
It's all right!

543
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:09,182
Come on, Mum. Quick.

544
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,205
They'll be fine. Won't you, boys?

545
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,126
Mum, we've got to hurry.

546
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,836
Now, I'll be back soon.

547
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,006
Go on and help yourself
to anything you want, as a reward.

548
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,525
Right!

549
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,701
Where are these wisps?

550
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:13,121
Come out, wisps. Come on out.

551
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,334
Lead me to the witch's cottage.

552
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,462
I'm here!

553
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,966
Fine. Don't come out
now that my mum's watching.

554
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:30,972
I was standing right here
and the wisp appeared right there.

555
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:34,976
Then a whole trail of them
led me off into the forest.

556
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:45,153
Does she think we're just going
to happen upon the witch's cottage?

557
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:01,461
Mum, I know this place.

558
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,797
The witch's cottage...

559
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,801
It's this way! Come on! Hurry!

560
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:20,146
I can't believe it. I found it.

561
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,612
No. She was here.

562
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:31,575
No, really, she was just here.

563
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,578
Wait.

564
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:41,334
No.

565
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:44,838
No, no. No! No!

566
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,616
Welcome to the Crafty Carver,

567
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,119
home of bear-themed carvings
and novelties.

568
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,372
I am completely out of stock
at this time.

569
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:24,544
But if you'd like to enquire about
portraits or wedding cake toppers,

570
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,796
pour vial one into the cauldron.

571
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:29,549
If you'd like the menu in Gaelic,
vial two.

572
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:32,469
If you're that red-haired lass, vial three.

573
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,888
To speak with a live homunculus...

574
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:39,434
Princess, I'm off to the Wickerman
Festival in Stornoway

575
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,478
and won't be back till spring.

576
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:45,190
There's one bit I forgot to tell you
about the spell.

577
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:49,069
By the second sunrise,
your spell will be permanent,

578
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:53,990
unless you remember these words.

579
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,660
Fate be changed,

580
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,662
look inside,

581
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,664
mend the bond

582
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,791
torn by pride.

583
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:06,920
"Fate be changed... Mend the bond."
What does that mean?

584
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,672
One more time.

585
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,590
Fate be changed,

586
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,759
look inside,

587
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,636
mend the bond

588
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,888
torn by pride.

589
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:18,682
That's it. Ta-ta.

590
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:21,976
And thank you for shopping
at the Crafty Carver.

591
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,355
No. No! Where'd you go?

592
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,941
- Welcome to the Crafty Carver...
- What?

593
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,235
...for all your...

594
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,489
Maybe there's a book of spells.
Look around. We'll need more vials.

595
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,452
I'm off to the Wickerman Festival
in Stornoway...

596
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:45,542
Thank you for visiting.
Have a lovely day.

597
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:24,789
We'll sort it out tomorrow.

598
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,466
My brave wee lassie, I'm here.

599
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,552
I'll always be right here.

600
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,828
Good morning.

601
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,122
So...

602
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,041
What's all this supposed to be?

603
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,298
What?

604
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,099
Sorry. I don't speak bear.

605
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:28,997
Find those by the creek, did you?

606
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,291
They're nightshade berries.

607
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:35,420
They're poisonous.

608
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:47,140
Where did you get this water?
It has worms.

609
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,778
Come on.

610
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:10,121
Breakfast.

611
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:16,753
Wait. A princess should not
have weapons, in your opinion.

612
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,256
There you go.

613
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,092
Go on.

614
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,473
How do you know you don't like it
if you won't try it?

615
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:37,602
Hey!

616
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,773
Where are you going?

617
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,951
Mum, come back.

618
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,093
Mum, is that you?

619
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,183
Mum?

620
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,690
You changed.

621
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,317
Like you were a...

622
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:30,571
I mean, like you were a bear
on the inside.

623
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,958
A wisp.

624
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,709
Mum!

625
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:45,753
Stop it!

626
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:49,257
Mum, no!

627
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,552
Mum...

628
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:01,352
Jings, crivens, help ma boab.

629
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,771
Mum, I know you're scared,

630
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:06,816
you're tired, you don't understand,

631
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,236
but we've got to keep our heads.

632
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,655
Just calm down.

633
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,116
Listen.

634
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,146
They'll show us the way.

635
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,259
Mum, look.

636
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,813
Why did the wisps
bring us here?

637
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,343
Whoever they were,
they've been gone for a long, long time.

638
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,311
I'm fine, Mum. Just fine.

639
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:18,990
It's

640
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:20,950
a throne room.

641
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,453
You suppose this could've
been the kingdom

642
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,247
in that story you were telling me?

643
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,041
The one with the princes.

644
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,672
One,

645
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:35,840
two,

646
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,550
three,

647
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:39,385
four.

648
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,345
The oldest.

649
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,434
Split, like the tapestry.

650
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:55,401
The spell. It's happened before.

651
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:02,533
"Strength of ten men."

652
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:06,037
"Fate be changed."

653
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:11,083
"Changed his fate."

654
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,836
Oh, no.

655
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,963
The prince became...

656
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:22,845
Mor'du.

657
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,956
Mum, we need to get back to the castle.

658
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:35,876
If we don't hurry,
you'll become like Mor'du.

659
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:37,378
A bear!

660
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,755
A real bear. Forever!

661
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:44,176
"Mend the bond torn by pride."

662
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:47,888
The witch gave us the answer.
The tapestry.

663
01:02:57,524 --> 01:03:00,401
Mum, do you have a better idea?

664
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:20,045
That'll do.

665
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,519
No more talk.

666
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:38,898
No more traditions. We settle this now!

667
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,483
You're the King.

668
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:44,445
You decide which one of our sons
your daughter will marry.

669
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:47,656
None of your sons
are fit to marry my daughter.

670
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:50,910
Then our alliance is over!
This means war!

671
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,208
They're gonna murder each other.

672
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:58,959
You've got to stop them
before it's too late.

673
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,005
I know, I know!

674
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,716
But how do we get you through there
and up to the tapestry

675
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,843
with the lot of them
boiling over like that?

676
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,574
- What are you doing, lass?
- It's all right, Dad.

677
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,910
I...

678
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,996
I have...

679
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:39,917
Well, you see, I...

680
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,628
I have been in conference
with the Queen.

681
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:45,548
- Is that so?
- Aye, it is.

682
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:47,883
- Well, where is she, then?
- She...

683
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:50,052
How do we know that
this isn't some trick?

684
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,971
- I'd never...
- This is highly irregular.

685
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,931
- What are you playing at?
- Where is the Queen?

686
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,559
We will not stand
for any more of this jiggery-pokery.

687
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,811
- That's right. Let's see her.
- Shut it!

688
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,818
Well, I...

689
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:19,123
Once there was an ancient kingdom.

690
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:20,207
What is this?

691
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:24,587
That kingdom fell into war

692
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,256
and chaos and ruin...

693
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,925
We've all heard that tale.
Lost kingdom.

694
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:31,510
Aye, but it's true.

695
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:35,264
I know now how one selfish act
can turn the fate of a kingdom.

696
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,765
It's just a legend.

697
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,517
Legends are lessons.

698
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,353
They ring with truths.

699
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:44,273
Our kingdom is young.

700
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,358
Our stories are not yet legend.

701
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:49,653
But in them, our bond was struck.

702
01:05:49,738 --> 01:05:51,864
Our clans were once enemies.

703
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,284
But when invaders threatened us
from the sea,

704
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:58,370
you joined together to defend our lands.

705
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,582
You fought for each other.

706
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,667
You risked everything for each other.

707
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:07,254
Lord MacGuffin, my dad saved your life,

708
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,590
stopping an arrow
as you ran to Dingwall's aid.

709
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,508
Aye, and I'll never forget it.

710
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,218
And, Lord Macintosh,

711
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:16,639
you saved my dad
when you charged in on heavy horse

712
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,432
and held off the advance.

713
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:22,561
And we all know how Lord Dingwall
broke the enemy line.

714
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:24,688
With a mighty throw of his spear!

715
01:06:24,773 --> 01:06:26,732
I was aiming at you, you big tumshie.

716
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:31,820
The story of this kingdom
is a powerful one.

717
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:34,365
My dad rallied your forces

718
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,950
and you made him your king.

719
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:41,121
It was an alliance forged in bravery
and friendship

720
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:42,915
and it lives to this day.

721
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:51,006
But I've been selfish.

722
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:54,134
I tore a great rift in our kingdom.

723
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,054
There's no one to blame but me.

724
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:01,558
And I know now
that I need to amend my mistake

725
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,395
and mend our bond.

726
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,817
And so, there is the matter
of my betrothal.

727
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:14,530
I've decided to do what's right

728
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:15,781
and...

729
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:20,619
...and...

730
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:24,790
...break tradition.

731
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,006
My mother,

732
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,969
the Queen, feels...

733
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,806
in her heart

734
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,808
that I...

735
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:47,187
...that we be free to...

736
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:52,151
...write our own story...

737
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:58,157
...follow our hearts

738
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:02,745
and find love in our own time.

739
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,752
That's beautiful.

740
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:13,547
The Queen and I put the decision
to you, my lords.

741
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:17,801
Might our young people decide
for themselves who they will love?

742
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:22,139
Well, since you've obviously
made up your minds about this,

743
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,391
I have one thing to say.

744
01:08:24,476 --> 01:08:26,769
- This is...
- A grand idea!

745
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:29,271
Give us our own say
in choosing our fate.

746
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:32,441
- What?
- Aye. Why shouldn't we choose?

747
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,693
But she's the princess.

748
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:37,780
I did not pick her out. It was your idea.

749
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:41,074
And you... You feel the same way?

750
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:47,372
Good?

751
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:52,961
Well, that settles it.

752
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:57,674
Let these lads try and win her heart
before they win her hand.

753
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,176
If they can.

754
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,137
I say, the wee Dingwall
has a fighting chance.

755
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:04,515
Fine, then. Seems for once we agree.

756
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:06,475
It was my idea in the first place.

757
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,613
Just like your mum.

758
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,073
You devil.

759
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,623
Everyone to the cellar!

760
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:34,127
Let's crack open the King's
private reserve to celebrate!

761
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:38,799
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

762
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:42,094
Bring the tiny glasses.

763
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,442
Oh, the tapestry!

764
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:02,739
Mend the bond...

765
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,034
Mend the bond.

766
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:08,871
Stitch it up. This'll change you back.

767
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:11,290
We just need needle and thread.

768
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:18,714
Mum?

769
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,343
Mum? Not now.

770
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:25,929
No. Please, not now.

771
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,849
Mum...

772
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:43,572
Elinor, dear, you'll never guess
who just solved our little suitor problem.

773
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,585
Elinor!

774
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:03,133
It can't be true!
Elinor, answer me, lass!

775
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:05,344
Elinor!

776
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:07,429
Merida.

777
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:11,141
- What?
- Dad, no! It's not what you think.

778
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,352
- Merida, get back!
- No!

779
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:20,442
No, Dad! Don't hurt her!

780
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:23,195
Get out of here!

781
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:26,031
Merida! No!

782
01:11:30,078 --> 01:11:31,995
No!

783
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,797
Mum.

784
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:50,722
It's all right. I'm all right. It's nothing.
It's just a little scratch. Mum!

785
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:52,766
My liege!

786
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,393
Fergus.

787
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,145
Bear!

788
01:11:58,189 --> 01:11:59,272
Dad!

789
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,900
Count your stars, lass.
It almost had you. Are you hurt?

790
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:03,735
It's your wife, Elinor.

791
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:08,991
Close the gate!

792
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:14,496
- You're talking nonsense!
- It's the truth!

793
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:17,791
There was a witch and she
gave me a spell. It's not Mor'du.

794
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:20,293
Mor'du or not, I'll avenge your mother!

795
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:24,423
- I'll not risk losing you, too.
- No, Dad! Just listen to me.

796
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:27,092
Listen! You can't!

797
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:31,513
- It's your wife Elinor!
- Maudie, keep this and don't let her out.

798
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:34,433
- What about the bear?
- Just stay put.

799
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,962
Come on, you sorry bunch of galoots!

800
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:14,222
Mum!

801
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:15,891
No.

802
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:18,268
No. Mum.

803
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,124
Maudie. Maudie!

804
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:43,794
I need you!

805
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,378
Now!

806
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:51,343
Oh, no.

807
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:54,888
Maudie.

808
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,019
Get the key.

809
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,582
Maudie!

810
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,341
Needle and thread. Needle and thread.
Needle and thread.

811
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:51,194
There he goes!

812
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:53,905
Needle and thread.
Needle and thread. Needle and thread.

813
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,240
You beauty!

814
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:25,353
One, two...

815
01:15:54,342 --> 01:15:56,760
Steady, Hamish.

816
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:59,137
There he goes.

817
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:10,982
We've got his track!

818
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,864
- Back, back, back!
- Get him!

819
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:23,995
Angus! Easy, laddie.

820
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:29,376
Hubert, Harris, help Hamish.

821
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:33,004
Watch your blade! You're going
to take somebody's arm off!

822
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,298
Aye, we've got you now!

823
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:39,427
- Give me a hand over here!
- Put your back into it, Dingwall!

824
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:40,804
I'm doing all the pulling here.

825
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:42,138
Down you go, you scoundrel.

826
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,018
Done!

827
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:15,964
- Get back. That's my mother.
- Are you out of your mind, lass?

828
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,507
Mum, are you hurt?

829
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:25,890
Merida!

830
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:31,271
I'll not let you kill my mother.

831
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,233
Boys!

832
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:36,818
Boys?

833
01:17:43,451 --> 01:17:45,118
- Mor'du!
- Kill it!

834
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:50,957
You scoundrel!

835
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:58,381
Come on!
I'll take you with my bare hands!

836
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:33,458
Mum!

837
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:52,203
The second sunrise.

838
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:33,411
No...

839
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:37,081
I don't understand. I...

840
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:52,138
Oh, Mum, I'm sorry.

841
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,351
This is all my fault.

842
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,770
I did this to you.

843
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,396
To us.

844
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,780
You've always been there for me.

845
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:12,158
You've never given up on me.

846
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:15,912
I just want you back.

847
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,461
I want you back, Mummy.

848
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:45,233
I love you.

849
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:15,138
Mum! You're back!

850
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:23,271
You changed!

851
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:25,523
Oh, darling,

852
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:28,026
we both have.

853
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:37,327
Elinor!

854
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:45,251
Oh, dear.

855
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:48,671
You're back. She came back to us.

856
01:22:48,756 --> 01:22:50,632
It's a great day for this kingdom.
The curse is broke.

857
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:54,427
Mum.

858
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:56,971
Dear?

859
01:22:57,056 --> 01:22:58,139
I'm naked.

860
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,391
Naked as a wee babby.

861
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,602
Don't just stare at me. Do something!

862
01:23:04,063 --> 01:23:06,481
What the... Avert your eyes, lads!

863
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:07,940
Show some respect!

864
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:15,740
Now that's what I call
a wee naked babby!

865
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:22,163
Merida, Elinor, hurry up.
They're leaving.

866
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,415
- Mum!
- They're off! Come on!

867
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,918
We've got to wave them off!
Come along!

868
01:23:55,614 --> 01:24:00,743
Goodbye! All the best!
Fair wind to your sails!

869
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:07,625
But how did this...

870
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:17,510
There are those who say fate
is something beyond our command,

871
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:21,013
that destiny is not our own.

872
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:23,349
But I know better.

873
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,562
Our fate lives within us.

874
01:24:29,398 --> 01:27:28,951
You only have to be brave enough
to see it.

875
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,534
Delivery. Sign here, sign here.

876
01:33:05,372 --> 01:33:07,623
Come on, birdbrain.
I haven't got all day.
