2
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:09,412
- Want toast?
- Yes.

3
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:11,180
Ellie, where's your cereal bowl?

4
00:03:11,253 --> 00:03:13,187
- I'm not hungry.
- You need to eat.

5
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:16,122
- I'm not hungry, Mom.
- You need to eat before school.

6
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:18,160
- One more bite.
- You want jelly?

7
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:19,854
Yes, please.

8
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:23,057
Watch it, Brenda.
Don't mess my clothes up.

9
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:25,100
Billy Baker's in my class this year.

10
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:27,135
- Did he flunk too?
- Shut up!

11
00:03:27,203 --> 00:03:29,763
- Hey!
- You're one to talk.

12
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:32,774
- Are you excited about school?
- Yeah.

13
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:34,776
- Isn't your sister cute?
- You stink.

14
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:35,936
Very cute.

15
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:38,981
He stinks. He's gotta shower
before he eats with us.

16
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:41,243
Stop picking on your brother and eat.

17
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:46,280
May Belle?

18
00:03:46,355 --> 00:03:48,482
- Honey, here's your juice.
- Thanks.

19
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:52,060
OK, who hid my sneakers?

20
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:55,620
Jess, you could hardly call them
sneakers anymore. I threw them out.

21
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:57,359
What? Mom!

22
00:03:57,433 --> 00:04:01,335
Sorry, but I will not send any child of
mine to school looking like some hobo.

23
00:04:01,404 --> 00:04:04,805
There's a perfectly good old pair
of Brenda's I put out for you.

24
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,842
These are girls' ones.

25
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,606
It's the fan belt this time,
but I got another.

26
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,274
- Bye-bye.
- Ellie? Honey, here you go.

27
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,909
- What's the matter?
- There's a big race today.

28
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:18,044
- And?
- My sneakers.

29
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,317
- I got a perfectly good pair for him.
- These are girls' ones.

30
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,484
- I can't race in these.
- You couldn't race in your old ones.

31
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,551
He needs some new sneakers, Mary.

32
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:31,324
- Catch Billy's eye in that.
- We don't have anything for extras.

33
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,392
- Excuse me?
- You're excused.

34
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,200
They make them the same.
You got your chores done?

35
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:40,074
Just about to.

36
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:21,811
I try to keep my pit stops
under ten seconds, ace.

37
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:24,681
Give it to me.

38
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:27,120
- Give it...
- Hey, that's my lunch!

39
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:28,622
I found it!

40
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:34,085
You're kidding me.

41
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:36,358
OK, that's enough.

42
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:39,291
Consider it a free lunch program,
farmer boy!

43
00:05:39,368 --> 00:05:41,097
All right, settle down.

44
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:43,202
Good one, Janice.

45
00:05:43,272 --> 00:05:46,036
What do you call your teacher?
I wanna tell Alexandra.

46
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:48,736
- "Monster Mouth." Now scoot.
- Alexandra,

47
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:53,771
- they call her "Monster Mouth" Myers.
- I said scoot!

48
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:55,785
A few ground rules for this classroom.

49
00:05:56,051 --> 00:06:00,078
No talking. No chewing gum.
No electronic devices. Be forewarned.

50
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:02,317
If you download essays
off the Internet,

51
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:05,326
you'll be downloaded into detention.

52
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:09,091
Let's start the year off on
the right foot and all do our own work.

53
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:12,032
- I expect you to take notes.
- Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

54
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:16,333
Know what that is?
My loser detector.

55
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:19,836
Jesse Aarons!

56
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:24,069
I got it from your sisters.
I do not need it from you.

57
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:26,478
- Oh, man.
- That goes for you as well.

58
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:28,039
He hit me.

59
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:32,414
- You're dead meat.
- Scott Hoager and Gary Fulcher,

60
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:33,512
be quiet!

61
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:37,957
Now, back to what we were discussing
before we were so rudely interrupted.

62
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:40,120
Sweet sneaks, Aarons.

63
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:43,427
You wear your sisters'
hand-me-down underwear too?

64
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:46,627
He asked you a question, twinkle toes.

65
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,034
Good morning, kids. Welcome back.
I hope you had a great summer.

66
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:57,840
Mrs. Myers, this is Leslie Burke,
who will be joining your class.

67
00:06:57,913 --> 00:07:01,781
- Leslie, welcome to Lark Creek.
- Thanks.

68
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:05,446
Thank you, Principal Turner.

69
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:08,649
Well, Leslie, um,
you'll sit at my desk this morning,

70
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:11,887
until we can figure out
where to squeeze you in.

71
00:07:15,364 --> 00:07:18,492
I like to start the year
with a little fun.

72
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:22,230
I want you all to write a one-page
essay about your favorite hobby.

73
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:23,794
Yes?

74
00:07:23,873 --> 00:07:27,866
Mrs. Myers, when you say one page,
did you mean both sides of the paper?

75
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:31,242
- You can do one side, Madison.
- I'll do two.

76
00:07:31,313 --> 00:07:34,578
- Yeah, that's cool.
- No way!

77
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,517
- It was so amazing.
- Can I have this?

78
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:40,919
You could have two bucks out of it all.
I'm getting most of it, OK?

79
00:07:42,324 --> 00:07:43,689
- Excuse me.
- Got a dollar?

80
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,990
- No.
- You're gonna have to use your pants.

81
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,721
- What's your problem?
- You got that backwards.

82
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:53,700
- You got the problem.
- That's right, new girl.

83
00:07:55,237 --> 00:07:58,673
- Nice feet.
- You say something?

84
00:07:58,741 --> 00:08:00,208
What I said was,

85
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:03,734
have you ever heard the story
about the trolls under the bridges

86
00:08:03,812 --> 00:08:06,246
who collect tolls
from unlucky travelers?

87
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:08,374
Trolls?
What is she talking about?

88
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:13,185
Nice try, beanpole.
It's still a dollar.

89
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:35,438
Yeah!

90
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:39,813
- Let's do it. Do it.
- Yeah, we've got Hoager.

91
00:08:41,884 --> 00:08:44,819
Next grade, line up.
Let's do this thing. Come on.

92
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:46,981
Fulcher, Hoager, get in here.

93
00:08:47,623 --> 00:08:49,955
Get ready.
Let's get this race started.

94
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:51,822
- Beep, beep, beep.
- Dead meat.

95
00:08:51,894 --> 00:08:56,490
Back behind the line. You know
how it goes. Back behind. Come on.

96
00:08:56,565 --> 00:08:58,999
Hey, new girl.
This is just for guys.

97
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:00,729
Hey, I'm talking to you!

98
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:03,772
What's the matter?
Afraid a girl's gonna beat you?

99
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:08,509
- On your mark. Get set.
- Dead meat.

100
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:19,153
Go, Hoager!
Get in there!

101
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:30,457
Go! Go, Jess, go!

102
00:09:33,335 --> 00:09:34,859
Come on!

103
00:09:34,937 --> 00:09:36,734
Come on! You can do it!

104
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:39,035
Come on, Jess!

105
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:41,099
Go, Jess, go!

106
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:58,489
Jess, Jess, did you win?

107
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:04,562
Hey, Jess, right?

108
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:17,141
- Idiot!
- What?

109
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:21,611
- See you tomorrow.
- Ten seconds, ace.

110
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,814
Thank you.

111
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:33,692
Are you following me?

112
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:35,627
No. I live over there.

113
00:10:35,697 --> 00:10:38,598
We're neighbors?
You got little sisters?

114
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:41,568
No. Just me.

115
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:43,502
You got any Barbies?

116
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:47,037
Yeah. I think I have a few.
You got any?

117
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:51,205
- Yeah, I have one... and a half.
- And a half?

118
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,511
One got cut in half
playing Super Extreme Barbies.

119
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,016
Never heard of that before.

120
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:58,053
You flush the toilet with them in it,

121
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,816
drop them from the upstairs window,
stuff like that.

122
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:04,052
- It's really fun.
- Sounds like fun.

123
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:07,687
- Well, I'll see you around.
- Yeah. See ya.

124
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:09,060
- See ya.
- Hey, guys.

125
00:11:09,131 --> 00:11:10,120
Hey, Dad.

126
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:13,259
- I'm getting supplies. You wanna come?
- Yeah. Sure.

127
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:15,068
See ya.

128
00:11:17,473 --> 00:11:19,873
There we go.
This'll make it feel better.

129
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:23,105
- How come it's my fault?
- When I ask you to watch the baby,

130
00:11:23,178 --> 00:11:25,772
- I mean watch the baby, Brenda.
- It's Ellie's turn.

131
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:28,783
- I'm doing my algebra.
- Put more cream on there.

132
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:31,285
You girls have to start
helping out more here.

133
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:33,014
You're not little kids anymore.

134
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:45,794
May Belle! How many times have
I told you, stay out of my stuff.

135
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:47,927
- It wasn't me.
- It was too you.

136
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:50,699
- You can't prove it!
- There a problem here?

137
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:53,070
- Daddy!
- Hey, sweetie.

138
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:55,337
Is he picking on you?

139
00:11:56,178 --> 00:11:59,204
- She was in my stuff.
- What stuff?

140
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:10,319
How'd that race go?

141
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:12,952
There's this new girl
moved in next door.

142
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:16,293
She beat all of the boys.
Even Jess.

143
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:22,632
Make sure you take out
the garbage before supper.

144
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:25,965
One drop.

145
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:29,477
And that's the magic.
Here comes May Belle's flowers.

146
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:33,103
Are these ever gonna grow?

147
00:12:33,182 --> 00:12:36,618
This greenhouse is gonna be filled
with your purple flowers.

148
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:39,677
May Belle's flowers.

149
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:43,989
I always wanted the one
that had, like, purple all over it.

150
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:47,818
They are so cool.

151
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:50,364
- These things are gonna grow fast.
- Me too.

152
00:12:50,432 --> 00:12:53,299
- Tomorrow, it's gonna be filled.
- Yeah.

153
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:56,565
The bell's gonna ring!

154
00:12:56,638 --> 00:13:00,096
- Good morning, everybody!
- Good morning, Ms. Edmunds!

155
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:02,234
Aren't you glad that summer's over?

156
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:05,769
- No!
- No? I am.

157
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:08,042
Come and get your instruments.

158
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:09,981
- Can I play the woodblock?
- Yes.

159
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:14,515
Ms. Edmunds?
May I please play the castanets?

160
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,821
Yes, you may.
Everybody ready for music?

161
00:13:18,393 --> 00:13:21,055
Take a picture.
Lasts longer.

162
00:13:21,263 --> 00:13:24,494
It's awfully quiet.
# Old McDonald had a farm...

163
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:27,501
- No!
- No? You don't like that song?

164
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:30,037
- No!
- Then make some noise. Come on.

165
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,832
- We saw this video yesterday.
- Whatever.

166
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:36,666
Change it!
Give it... give it to me!

167
00:14:36,738 --> 00:14:38,968
Stop it.
You're always fighting.

168
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,442
- Wait till I get my own place.
- I wanna watch this.

169
00:14:42,511 --> 00:14:45,480
We just can't keep going like this.

170
00:14:45,547 --> 00:14:48,914
Honey, uh... I've only got what I've got
to work with. We gotta...

171
00:14:48,984 --> 00:14:51,509
You gotta figure out
a way to get down on this.

172
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,521
It's a problem,
but I'm gonna try to get going.

173
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:58,389
And maybe you can pick up
another shift at the store.

174
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:01,185
Dead meat.

175
00:15:06,735 --> 00:15:09,533
You're really good at drawing.

176
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:12,596
Like, better than any kid
I've ever seen.

177
00:15:12,674 --> 00:15:14,266
Thanks.

178
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,739
I wanna share
this composition for two reasons.

179
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:24,274
One, it uses adjectives well.
And two,

180
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:29,120
it's clear the author paid attention
to what she saw and what she felt,

181
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:32,683
which is important for any writing.

182
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:37,664
Self-Contained Underwater
Breathing Apparatus by Leslie Burke.

183
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,763
Leslie, why don't you read it for us.

184
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,165
Oh, man.
Can you believe this?

185
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:54,579
"I'm moving gently forward,

186
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,219
over the wild and beautiful,
unexplored world below me.

187
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:01,785
I'm floating in silence,

188
00:16:02,124 --> 00:16:04,888
and breaking it up
with the sound of my breath.

189
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,896
Above me, there's nothing
but shimmery light,

190
00:16:08,964 --> 00:16:10,955
the place where I've come from,

191
00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:13,500
and will go back to
when I am done here.

192
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:16,002
I'm diving.

193
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:18,733
I'm a scuba diver.

194
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:22,368
I'm going deeper past
the wrinkled rocks and dark seaweed

195
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:26,505
toward a deep blueness
where a school of silver fish wait.

196
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:30,512
As I swim through the water,

197
00:16:30,585 --> 00:16:33,213
bubbles burst from me,

198
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:36,189
wobbling like little jellyfish
as they rise.

199
00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:38,226
I check my air.

200
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:41,262
I don't have as much time
as I need to see everything,

201
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:44,127
but that is what makes it so special."

202
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:48,560
Thank you, Leslie.
Now tonight at 7:00 on channel four

203
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:52,937
there is a special about
an undersea explorer, Dr. Bob Ballard.

204
00:16:53,008 --> 00:16:57,342
I want everyone to watch and write one
page about what you've learned.

205
00:16:57,412 --> 00:16:58,879
Leslie?

206
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:01,074
What if you can't watch this program?

207
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:04,744
Inform your parents it's an assignment,
I'm sure they won't object.

208
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,880
But... what if you don't have a TV?

209
00:17:14,996 --> 00:17:17,123
My dad says the TV
kills your brain cells.

210
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,499
Your dad doesn't know anything.
We watch TV, like, every day.

211
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,800
- I rest my case.
- Well, then, Leslie,

212
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:27,808
you don't have to write this essay.
Pick something else to write about.

213
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:30,470
Yeah, like, how to live in a cave.

214
00:17:30,545 --> 00:17:32,706
That's enough, Mr. Hoager.

215
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,483
Hey, Leslie, come here.

216
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:43,786
What are you gonna write your essay on?
Bats in caves?

217
00:17:57,772 --> 00:18:00,935
- Here comes Janice!
- New kid's in Janice's seat.

218
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:05,207
- What does she think she's doing?
- Jess! The big kids will kill her!

219
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:09,279
You have a death wish?
This row's for eighth-graders.

220
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:14,220
That's right, beanpole. Move it.
Out of my way, farm boy.

221
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,941
You're really asking for it.

222
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,138
Seems to me she gives it out
whether you ask for it or not.

223
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:40,374
So might as well have some fun.

224
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:44,179
Getting Janice all wound up
is a weird way of having fun.

225
00:18:45,854 --> 00:18:48,687
Well, what's your idea of having fun?

226
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:51,618
- I don't know.
- Well, you wanna do something?

227
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,854
- I don't know.
- Let's do something. Definitely.

228
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,227
- What?
- You can't do it.

229
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:59,096
- Do what?
- What we're doing.

230
00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:07,540
Hey, May Belle!
I don't use my Barbies anymore.

231
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:10,874
- If you want, you can have them.
- To keep for permanent?

232
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:12,914
- Sure.
- Thanks.

233
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:17,345
You're lucky to have a sister.

234
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:20,286
I've got four, and I'd
trade them all for a good dog.

235
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:22,721
I'd love to have a dog.

236
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,089
Now let's go before
she changes her mind.

237
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:28,628
Race you to the end of the road.
On your mark, get set, go!

238
00:19:59,494 --> 00:20:01,428
Come on, Jess!

239
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:02,622
Come on!

240
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:09,899
What about sharks?

241
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:14,269
You ever see any sharks while you're

242
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:16,503
scuba-ing or whatever?

243
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:19,274
I've never gone scuba diving
in my whole life.

244
00:20:20,682 --> 00:20:24,174
- You lied in your essay?
- No. I made it up.

245
00:20:24,252 --> 00:20:26,516
It's different from lying.

246
00:20:28,023 --> 00:20:31,254
Those drawings you make,
you seen those things yourself?

247
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,094
No, but...

248
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,191
Hey! Look at that!

249
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:42,535
- Cool!
- That's been there forever.

250
00:20:42,604 --> 00:20:44,003
I wouldn't trust it.

251
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:46,637
Come on. Just try it.

252
00:20:49,044 --> 00:20:50,534
OK.

253
00:20:57,118 --> 00:20:59,279
You got it? That's it.

254
00:21:00,889 --> 00:21:02,254
Thanks.

255
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,824
- What are you doing?
- Getting up higher.

256
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:11,061
OK.

257
00:21:19,307 --> 00:21:22,572
That was so much fun.
You have to try it. Come on.

258
00:21:44,032 --> 00:21:45,465
OK.

259
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:05,279
Let your head hang back,
watch the clouds.

260
00:22:05,353 --> 00:22:07,184
Feels like flying.

261
00:22:33,615 --> 00:22:37,642
We need a place.
Just for us.

262
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:40,721
Where there's no
Janice Averys or Scott Hoagers.

263
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:44,623
Yeah, but when we go back to school,
there they are waiting.

264
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:46,387
Yeah, but...

265
00:22:46,461 --> 00:22:49,624
...someplace better than
just not being at school.

266
00:22:50,331 --> 00:22:53,266
What if there was a magical kingdom
only we knew about?

267
00:22:54,435 --> 00:22:56,096
I don't know. What if?

268
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:58,435
OK, well...

269
00:22:58,506 --> 00:23:01,168
...what if the only way
we could enter it

270
00:23:01,242 --> 00:23:03,608
is by swinging on this enchanted rope?

271
00:23:03,678 --> 00:23:06,647
- Enchanted rope?
- Yeah.

272
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:09,176
Come on.

273
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:16,448
Leslie!

274
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:18,850
Leslie!

275
00:23:29,804 --> 00:23:31,567
Leslie.

276
00:23:36,778 --> 00:23:39,110
- Come on!
- Wait up.

277
00:24:08,743 --> 00:24:10,267
Ahh!

278
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:12,905
We shouldn't be in here.
This isn't our land.

279
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:16,041
- Not so loud. They'll hear you.
- What are you talking about?

280
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:25,086
Hey! What's that?

281
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:30,722
Jess, look at this.

282
00:24:33,234 --> 00:24:36,670
Too bad for them.
They got so close.

283
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:39,901
- What are you talking about?
- To the kingdom.

284
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,838
- What's that?
- What?

285
00:24:44,913 --> 00:24:48,110
That sound. I've heard it before.
Someone's out there.

286
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:51,174
That's the sound of the prisoners
rattling their chains.

287
00:24:51,986 --> 00:24:53,886
What prisoners?

288
00:24:53,955 --> 00:24:56,389
The prisoners of the Dark Master.

289
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:03,263
- We should go.
- Wait, Jess, look.

290
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,226
What is it?

291
00:25:10,405 --> 00:25:11,929
Look at this.

292
00:25:19,347 --> 00:25:22,009
This is amazing.

293
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:40,356
This is it.

294
00:25:56,584 --> 00:25:58,245
Warriors.

295
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:03,822
- Try dragonflies.
- No. They're warriors.

296
00:26:03,891 --> 00:26:06,257
From the treetop provinces.

297
00:26:07,428 --> 00:26:11,660
- I don't know this game.
- What game? This is for real.

298
00:26:14,035 --> 00:26:17,869
This is the ruins
of a once great fortress

299
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:20,430
whose people have been imprisoned.

300
00:26:22,543 --> 00:26:25,512
Jess, you and I have been
sent to free them.

301
00:26:27,682 --> 00:26:31,015
Prisoners of the Dark Master, hear me!

302
00:26:31,652 --> 00:26:34,416
We have come to free you.

303
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:36,150
Do you hear us?

304
00:26:36,224 --> 00:26:38,192
Show me that you hear us!

305
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,636
You got lucky timing. The wind's
been blowing off and on all day.

306
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:56,172
Can't hear you!

307
00:27:30,878 --> 00:27:33,972
- Go straight home. I'll see you soon.
- OK. See ya!

308
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:01,963
Hey, don't you think
we should give her a hand?

309
00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:06,798
She's fine.

310
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:09,799
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

311
00:29:09,877 --> 00:29:11,538
...forget. There are four of us.

312
00:29:11,612 --> 00:29:12,943
OK.

313
00:29:14,882 --> 00:29:16,873
Remember to bring your bag.

314
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:19,419
Why would anyone want to wear that?

315
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:26,492
Janice!

316
00:29:26,561 --> 00:29:28,188
- You OK?
- What's the problem?

317
00:29:28,262 --> 00:29:31,026
- Jess Aarons tripped me.
- Uh...

318
00:29:31,098 --> 00:29:33,157
On purpose.

319
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:35,828
OK, Aarons. Hit the road.

320
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:39,269
- But he didn't do anything.
- Go.

321
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,071
- It was definitely him.
- I know.

322
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:02,623
- What happened to you?
- Janice is a very talented person.

323
00:30:02,697 --> 00:30:05,530
She can shoot ketchup packets
over four rows of seats.

324
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,363
Jeez.

325
00:30:07,768 --> 00:30:10,862
Can I wash up at your house?
My mom sees this, she'll be all over

326
00:30:10,938 --> 00:30:13,566
the principal and everybody,
and my life will be over.

327
00:30:16,577 --> 00:30:19,671
Why would Dad do this?

328
00:30:19,747 --> 00:30:21,681
Hello.

329
00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:24,183
Mom, this is Leslie.

330
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:26,117
- Hi, Leslie.
- Hi.

331
00:30:26,187 --> 00:30:28,883
- It's nice to meet you.
- Thank you. You too.

332
00:30:30,024 --> 00:30:32,618
So are you and your family
getting settled in OK?

333
00:30:32,693 --> 00:30:36,094
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's nice.

334
00:30:36,163 --> 00:30:38,791
- Come on. See ya later.
- Not too late, OK, honey?

335
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,560
- Weird and weirder.
- Hey. Be glad he's found a friend.

336
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:48,370
- Where's your dad work?
- At home. Same as my mom.

337
00:30:48,442 --> 00:30:50,535
- They're writers.
- Writers?

338
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:53,705
- What do they write about?
- Fiction.

339
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:55,408
That explains you.

340
00:30:56,884 --> 00:31:00,320
- What do you mean?
- Well, you like to make things up.

341
00:31:00,388 --> 00:31:02,879
And that's what your parents
do for a living.

342
00:31:04,258 --> 00:31:06,886
You know a lot about hardware?

343
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:08,895
No. Why?

344
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:12,524
Well, your dad works
at a hardware store.

345
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,261
OK.

346
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:17,465
All I'm saying is that
you are who you are...

347
00:31:17,538 --> 00:31:19,199
...not your parents.

348
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:25,270
If they work at your house, you must
get to hang out with them a lot.

349
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:29,812
Not really.

350
00:31:32,286 --> 00:31:34,049
What's that?

351
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:36,988
- Grenade.
- There're no grenades here.

352
00:31:40,361 --> 00:31:41,555
Come on!

353
00:31:45,232 --> 00:31:48,633
- Squirrels!
- Part squirrel, part Scott Hoager.

354
00:31:48,703 --> 00:31:51,729
- Squogre.
- Squogre!

355
00:31:52,106 --> 00:31:54,631
The sneaky foot soldiers
of the Dark Master.

356
00:31:55,776 --> 00:31:58,006
- They're attacking!
- We need ammo!

357
00:32:05,753 --> 00:32:07,778
This is not good.

358
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,182
- See them? Up there?
- Yeah.

359
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,287
- Do you? Really?
- Yeah.

360
00:32:27,975 --> 00:32:29,237
Les...

361
00:32:30,411 --> 00:32:31,571
Leslie?

362
00:32:33,314 --> 00:32:36,613
Leslie. Leslie!

363
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,879
Come on. You can see
the whole kingdom from up here.

364
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:47,484
Isn't this cool?
We can do anything here.

365
00:32:57,204 --> 00:32:59,104
Look at it.

366
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:01,903
It's all ours.

367
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:05,468
From the mountains to the oceans.

368
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:11,044
- What am I looking for exactly?
- You'll see.

369
00:33:11,118 --> 00:33:14,087
Just close your eyes...

370
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:15,918
...but keep your mind wide open.

371
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:35,666
What do we call this place?

372
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:40,304
Terabithia.

373
00:33:46,987 --> 00:33:51,447
Everybody tiptoe. OK, ready?

374
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:54,726
Happy birthday!

375
00:33:54,795 --> 00:33:58,458
# Happy birthday to you

376
00:33:58,532 --> 00:34:01,729
# Happy birthday to you

377
00:34:01,802 --> 00:34:05,636
# Happy birthday, dear Jess

378
00:34:05,706 --> 00:34:08,641
# Happy birthday to you #

379
00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:10,306
Make a wish.

380
00:34:11,145 --> 00:34:13,136
What'd you wish for?

381
00:34:13,214 --> 00:34:15,910
Keep Your Mind Wide Open

382
00:34:19,253 --> 00:34:22,711
- This is cheap junk.
- No, it isn't.

383
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:25,588
- I love it.
- How? It doesn't even work.

384
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:28,423
I don't think we have
the hang of it yet, Dad.

385
00:34:28,496 --> 00:34:31,556
You know what? Keep the box.
We'll see if we can take it back.

386
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:36,059
Daddy, there's something
in the greenhouse.

387
00:34:41,942 --> 00:34:45,309
That's the last thing I need,
some animal chewing it's way in here.

388
00:34:46,313 --> 00:34:48,679
What are you going to do
if you catch it?

389
00:34:48,749 --> 00:34:51,047
These vegetables are our livelihood.

390
00:34:51,118 --> 00:34:54,315
Can't afford to share them
with animals that get in here.

391
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:57,190
- So, you're gonna kill it?
- Have to.

392
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:04,025
Well, he's not gonna
get in here now, right, Dad?

393
00:35:04,098 --> 00:35:07,795
Hope not. But if he does,
you just let me deal with it.

394
00:35:09,236 --> 00:35:11,500
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

395
00:35:11,572 --> 00:35:15,303
No, why don't you go on and do
your homework, I'll clean this mess up.

396
00:35:27,154 --> 00:35:29,122
Under the seat.

397
00:35:34,061 --> 00:35:36,222
I heard it was
your birthday yesterday.

398
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:43,402
Like it?

399
00:35:44,238 --> 00:35:46,729
It must've cost a fortune.

400
00:35:47,274 --> 00:35:49,469
What's it matter what it costs?

401
00:35:50,411 --> 00:35:51,673
I don't know.

402
00:35:51,745 --> 00:35:55,181
Well, I can take it back
and get a cheaper one, if you want.

403
00:35:56,951 --> 00:35:59,943
Thanks... a lot.

404
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:03,755
# Jess and Leslie sitting in a tree...

405
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:16,994
Look.
The squogre and the vulture.

406
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:18,766
Hey, here he comes.

407
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:22,366
And a guy who can stand up to a squogre
is scared of a Hoager?

408
00:36:25,412 --> 00:36:27,505
Ms. Edmunds?

409
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:30,448
- He speaks.
- Can I help you with those?

410
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:33,918
You sure can.
And you just made my day.

411
00:36:36,523 --> 00:36:37,956
- Great.
- I'll get that one.

412
00:36:38,025 --> 00:36:39,322
Thank you.

413
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,560
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, boys.

414
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,110
How come you're so good at that?

415
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:01,340
- Good at what?
- Building stuff.

416
00:37:01,415 --> 00:37:02,939
You're good at it for a girl.

417
00:37:03,017 --> 00:37:05,918
Same way I'm fast... for a girl.

418
00:37:05,986 --> 00:37:08,511
You know what I mean.

419
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:11,683
You're pretty good at art... for a boy.

420
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:13,659
OK, OK, truce.

421
00:37:17,798 --> 00:37:20,266
Don't your parents notice
this stuff's missing?

422
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:22,767
Not when they're in
the middle of writing a book.

423
00:37:22,836 --> 00:37:25,396
What's that?

424
00:37:26,573 --> 00:37:27,767
Show yourselves!

425
00:37:41,388 --> 00:37:43,754
It's a giant troll!

426
00:37:43,824 --> 00:37:46,054
No, it's a giant tree
that almost killed us!

427
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:48,617
You think that tree
just fell all by itself?

428
00:37:49,863 --> 00:37:50,955
Come on.

429
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:54,467
When the Dark Master saw
the squogres weren't scaring us away,

430
00:37:54,535 --> 00:37:58,027
- he sent a giant troll.
- How big?

431
00:38:02,543 --> 00:38:04,534
That's how big its feet are.

432
00:38:07,781 --> 00:38:10,978
- You really think so?
- What else could it be?

433
00:38:12,753 --> 00:38:14,584
What should we do?

434
00:38:20,094 --> 00:38:23,928
If we had a troll hunter, we could
track its scent and sneak up on it.

435
00:38:24,732 --> 00:38:26,723
Hey, look at that! Come on!

436
00:38:29,503 --> 00:38:30,970
I think it went that way!

437
00:38:31,939 --> 00:38:35,204
We rule Terabithia,
and nothing crushes us!

438
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,572
I'll race you to the rope.

439
00:38:47,688 --> 00:38:50,179
I love this place!

440
00:39:08,008 --> 00:39:10,772
Go on, get out of here.
And don't come back.

441
00:39:24,558 --> 00:39:26,549
What do you think you're doing?

442
00:39:26,627 --> 00:39:30,586
- I took care of it for you.
- Did you, now? Now, how'd you do that?

443
00:39:30,664 --> 00:39:33,565
I took him into the forest.
He's not coming back, promise.

444
00:39:33,634 --> 00:39:37,001
Did he tell you he's gonna
stay the hell out of the greenhouse?

445
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,561
No, he went out there
and he's not coming...

446
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,904
Jess, you need to understand
something, OK?

447
00:39:41,975 --> 00:39:45,843
This is not one of your cartoons. This
is just a pest that eats up our food,

448
00:39:45,913 --> 00:39:48,074
money we earn and time we don't have.

449
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:51,349
- OK.
- Get your head out of the clouds

450
00:39:51,418 --> 00:39:52,612
and do as I say.

451
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,383
OK.

452
00:40:25,586 --> 00:40:27,520
Good night, sweetheart.

453
00:40:29,256 --> 00:40:30,848
Sweet dreams.

454
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:35,326
Lights out, Jess.

455
00:40:35,395 --> 00:40:37,022
Night, Dad.

456
00:40:43,237 --> 00:40:46,001
Are we slaying the giant troll
after school today?

457
00:40:46,073 --> 00:40:48,837
You've got your head
in the clouds, Leslie.

458
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:52,436
- Huh?
- There is no giant troll, all right?

459
00:40:52,512 --> 00:40:56,312
Well, you better not let
the Terabithians hear you.

460
00:40:56,383 --> 00:40:58,283
They thought you were their king.

461
00:41:12,566 --> 00:41:16,195
Alexandra, my daddy gave me Twinkies!

462
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:19,501
Neither one squished, 'cause I
didn't put them next to my drink.

463
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:21,404
I'd shut up about those Twinkies.

464
00:41:21,475 --> 00:41:24,239
You're just mad 'cause I
got some and you didn't.

465
00:41:24,311 --> 00:41:26,575
Whatever. Don't cry to me
when you lose them.

466
00:41:26,647 --> 00:41:28,205
I'll eat them, not lose them.

467
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:36,754
Jess! Jess!

468
00:41:36,823 --> 00:41:40,884
Janice Avery stole my Twinkies!
Janice Avery stole my Twinkies!

469
00:41:40,961 --> 00:41:44,795
- I told you, keep your mouth shut.
- She's there. What are you gonna do?

470
00:41:44,865 --> 00:41:47,060
And she makes you pay to pee!

471
00:41:48,468 --> 00:41:50,163
It's a dollar, shorty.

472
00:41:50,237 --> 00:41:53,934
But I don't have a dollar.

473
00:41:54,007 --> 00:41:57,568
That's not fair, is it?
Peeing's definitely supposed to be free.

474
00:41:57,644 --> 00:41:59,009
Free to pee!

475
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:02,276
Free to pee! Free to pee! Free to pee!

476
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:06,310
Let's go.

477
00:42:18,765 --> 00:42:21,097
I want my Twinkies, Janice Avery.

478
00:42:21,168 --> 00:42:23,102
What Twinkies, Twinkie?

479
00:42:24,404 --> 00:42:27,703
You're supposed to beat her up.
You're my brother!

480
00:42:27,774 --> 00:42:30,902
Do you know what would happen
if I were to pick a fight with her?

481
00:42:30,978 --> 00:42:33,173
You'll get your butt kicked.

482
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:37,205
No, I'd get kicked out of school for
fighting a girl. What's that prove?

483
00:42:37,284 --> 00:42:40,014
She stole my Twinkies.

484
00:42:41,588 --> 00:42:43,351
Come on.

485
00:42:45,225 --> 00:42:47,056
It's all right, May Belle.

486
00:42:47,127 --> 00:42:50,995
We'll get her back. Wort we, Jess?

487
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:58,333
Don't let the Terabithians hear you.

488
00:42:58,405 --> 00:43:00,339
They thought you were their king.

489
00:43:20,527 --> 00:43:22,586
Jess! Jess!

490
00:43:33,073 --> 00:43:36,634
Hi! Look at you!

491
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:41,477
That is your very own, certified,
purebred, giant troll hunter.

492
00:43:42,082 --> 00:43:43,515
- He's for me?
- Yeah,

493
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,983
he just took a giant
pee all over my sweatshirt.

494
00:43:46,053 --> 00:43:48,521
Jess. Thank you.

495
00:43:52,993 --> 00:43:55,086
I name you Prince Terrien,

496
00:43:55,162 --> 00:43:58,063
giant troll hunter extraordinaire.

497
00:43:58,131 --> 00:44:00,099
P.T. For short.

498
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,900
Hey! I think he smells a troll.
Come on.

499
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:12,004
Oh, no! We've got company!

500
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,274
Dead meat! Dead meat!

501
00:44:15,615 --> 00:44:18,175
- Dead meat! Dead meat!
- Hairy Vultures!

502
00:44:20,187 --> 00:44:21,848
What's that?

503
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,724
It's a giant troll.

504
00:44:33,934 --> 00:44:35,299
Nice feet.

505
00:44:38,004 --> 00:44:39,335
Run!

506
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:43,742
Oh, my gosh!

507
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,577
I think we lost it.

508
00:44:54,621 --> 00:44:59,251
Leslie...

509
00:44:59,326 --> 00:45:01,920
- What's its weak spot?
- Does it have a weak spot?

510
00:45:01,995 --> 00:45:03,462
I don't know!

511
00:45:05,098 --> 00:45:08,295
Just making it madder!

512
00:45:08,902 --> 00:45:10,631
P.T.!

513
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:16,000
That's it! That's its weak spot!

514
00:45:16,076 --> 00:45:18,010
It's ticklish!

515
00:45:19,513 --> 00:45:22,243
- Gross!
- Troll toe jam.

516
00:45:23,216 --> 00:45:25,411
Good boy, P.T. Good boy!

517
00:45:25,986 --> 00:45:27,613
Good dog.

518
00:45:33,493 --> 00:45:35,723
What's Janice's weak spot, you think?

519
00:45:37,597 --> 00:45:39,963
Eighth-grade girl...

520
00:45:40,033 --> 00:45:41,830
...probably eighth-grade boys.

521
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:43,961
Who's she got a crush on?

522
00:45:44,037 --> 00:45:46,665
I don't know. Let's see...

523
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,267
...coolest boy in
eighth grade is probably...

524
00:45:50,343 --> 00:45:51,901
...Willard Hughes.

525
00:45:51,978 --> 00:45:54,446
- That's it.
- What's it?

526
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:58,783
Write, "Dear Janice..."

527
00:45:58,852 --> 00:46:01,514
- You do it.
- No way.

528
00:46:01,588 --> 00:46:04,113
Boys' handwriting sucks.
No offense.

529
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:05,385
It's gotta be you.

530
00:46:07,827 --> 00:46:09,488
OK.

531
00:46:09,563 --> 00:46:11,531
"Dear Janice,

532
00:46:11,598 --> 00:46:15,125
you're the most amazing and
beautiful person I've ever known."

533
00:46:15,202 --> 00:46:19,036
- How do I know which desk is hers?
- It's got dried-up blood and old bones.

534
00:46:23,443 --> 00:46:26,879
"I do not know if you know this
about me, but I need to tell you,

535
00:46:26,947 --> 00:46:30,348
I think you are so cool.

536
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:34,285
You are the coolest over
all the other girls in our school."

537
00:46:34,354 --> 00:46:35,878
OK. Write this,

538
00:46:35,956 --> 00:46:39,585
"Let's find out if what
I think we have is real."

539
00:46:43,463 --> 00:46:45,693
Mr. Bailey...

540
00:46:45,765 --> 00:46:49,223
- ...I was looking for you.
- Me? Why?

541
00:46:49,302 --> 00:46:52,533
I think someone threw up
in the girls' room.

542
00:46:52,606 --> 00:46:54,801
All right, I'll take a look.

543
00:47:00,714 --> 00:47:03,615
"Meet me by the bus
after school today.

544
00:47:03,683 --> 00:47:06,948
We can ride home together
and talk about us."

545
00:47:08,722 --> 00:47:11,384
Underline and capitalize the "us."

546
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:13,619
"All my love, Willard."

547
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:19,958
You know, if we get caught,
they're both gonna kill us.

548
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:32,539
- I got your note.
- What are you talking about?

549
00:47:32,612 --> 00:47:34,204
That was really sweet.

550
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:36,613
- I'm saving these seats.
- For who?

551
00:47:36,683 --> 00:47:39,447
Willard Hughes is gonna
ride Janice home today.

552
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,283
- What are you talking about?
- Willard and Janice.

553
00:47:42,355 --> 00:47:44,550
They're totally in love.

554
00:47:44,624 --> 00:47:47,889
In your dreams.
Well, you better tell Willard that.

555
00:47:47,961 --> 00:47:50,327
It looks like he's
heading home in his own bus.

556
00:47:59,806 --> 00:48:01,706
Look at Janice!

557
00:48:05,545 --> 00:48:08,275
Hey, Janice, what happened?

558
00:48:08,348 --> 00:48:10,646
Didn't Willard know
he's in love with you?

559
00:48:13,353 --> 00:48:15,947
Where's your boyfriend, Janice?

560
00:48:24,064 --> 00:48:27,591
- What just happened?
- He just walked away.

561
00:48:34,407 --> 00:48:36,500
- Yes.
- You wanna go?

562
00:48:36,576 --> 00:48:38,510
- Yeah.
- I wanna come.

563
00:48:38,578 --> 00:48:42,173
- You can't.
- It's a free country!

564
00:48:42,248 --> 00:48:45,547
Don't follow us, or I'll tell Alexandra
you still suck your thumb

565
00:48:45,618 --> 00:48:47,552
and sleep with Mr. Blanky.

566
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:54,026
- So, what do you say?
- They must have finished their book.

567
00:48:54,094 --> 00:48:56,392
- How do you know?
- Hey, Leslie.

568
00:48:56,463 --> 00:48:59,057
- We need your help.
- Come on.

569
00:49:03,737 --> 00:49:06,638
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Leslie, come on.

570
00:49:06,706 --> 00:49:08,901
All right, let's go.
We're on a mission.

571
00:49:08,975 --> 00:49:11,307
Hey, this is my friend, Jess.
Can he help?

572
00:49:11,378 --> 00:49:14,370
So, you're the infamous Jess.
Hi, I'm Judy.

573
00:49:14,447 --> 00:49:17,177
Leslie tells me you're good
with a paint brush.

574
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,911
Grab one and get going.

575
00:49:18,985 --> 00:49:21,920
Come on! I am determined
to have this wall finished

576
00:49:21,988 --> 00:49:25,549
so when the late sun hits it,
we can watch it catch fire.

577
00:49:29,796 --> 00:49:33,994
Now, that's one steady hand, Jess.
That's an artist's hand. Am I right?

578
00:49:35,402 --> 00:49:36,960
Yeah.

579
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,568
You know,
the best prize that life offers,

580
00:49:39,639 --> 00:49:42,403
is the chance to work hard
at work worth doing.

581
00:49:42,475 --> 00:49:44,534
Teddy Roosevelt said that, not me.

582
00:50:22,348 --> 00:50:26,284
What did I tell you?
Was it worth it?

583
00:50:54,481 --> 00:50:56,005
Hey, guys.

584
00:50:56,082 --> 00:50:58,573
Jess, get started on your homework, OK?

585
00:50:58,651 --> 00:51:01,279
I'm managing the store
on weekends, starting soon,

586
00:51:01,354 --> 00:51:04,118
I need you to pick up
on some chores around here.

587
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,784
You know, the best prize
that life can offer

588
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,727
is working hard at work worth doing.

589
00:51:24,511 --> 00:51:25,773
Hey...

590
00:51:27,981 --> 00:51:30,415
...have you taken art classes?

591
00:51:30,483 --> 00:51:33,884
No, I...
I just made them up myself.

592
00:51:33,953 --> 00:51:35,750
You're really talented.

593
00:51:39,092 --> 00:51:42,425
Jess, don't let those other kids
get in your way.

594
00:51:44,731 --> 00:51:47,996
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

595
00:51:52,438 --> 00:51:54,338
I just went to use the girl's room.

596
00:51:54,407 --> 00:51:56,705
Someone's in a stall,
crying their eyes out,

597
00:51:56,776 --> 00:51:58,937
and I think it's Janice Avery.

598
00:51:59,012 --> 00:52:00,980
It can't be the trick we played, can it?

599
00:52:01,047 --> 00:52:02,878
No way. But come here.

600
00:52:07,153 --> 00:52:08,984
Free to pee!

601
00:52:09,222 --> 00:52:11,213
Get out of here!

602
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:14,749
Get out of here, now!

603
00:52:16,663 --> 00:52:19,598
- You should go talk to her.
- You kidding?

604
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:23,033
It's not "skinned knee crying,"
it's something serious.

605
00:52:23,102 --> 00:52:25,468
It's the girls' bathroom,
I can't go in there.

606
00:52:25,538 --> 00:52:28,598
- I don't wanna go in there alone.
- What's the matter?

607
00:52:28,675 --> 00:52:32,634
A girl who can stand up to a giant troll
is afraid of some dumb eighth grader?

608
00:53:05,979 --> 00:53:07,241
Sorry.

609
00:53:07,313 --> 00:53:10,612
- Go on, tell me.
- No, I don't wanna tell you.

610
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:13,208
- Why not?
- I'll tell you there.

611
00:53:17,123 --> 00:53:21,082
He, like, came up to me.
I'm pretty sure he likes me.

612
00:53:28,601 --> 00:53:31,229
No way! I like Tony!

613
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:37,801
Her dad gets really mad at her.

614
00:53:37,877 --> 00:53:41,677
So? My dad gets mad at me...
pretty much all the time.

615
00:53:41,748 --> 00:53:44,012
He hits her.

616
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:48,076
Some neighbor heard them
yelling so loud, they called the police.

617
00:53:48,154 --> 00:53:52,284
And it got out. And all the seventh
and the eighth graders know about it.

618
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:57,523
Which explains, like, a lot.

619
00:53:59,565 --> 00:54:02,830
Well, what did you say to her?

620
00:54:02,902 --> 00:54:06,429
Well, I told her about not having a TV

621
00:54:06,506 --> 00:54:08,406
and everyone laughing at me.

622
00:54:08,474 --> 00:54:11,466
I know what it's like
to have everyone think I was weird.

623
00:54:11,544 --> 00:54:13,535
Then what'd she say?

624
00:54:13,613 --> 00:54:15,774
She asked me for advice.

625
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:18,850
Janice Avery asked you for advice?

626
00:54:18,918 --> 00:54:21,318
- Yeah.
- And?

627
00:54:21,387 --> 00:54:23,787
Well, I told her just to pretend

628
00:54:23,856 --> 00:54:26,984
that she had no idea
what anyone was talking about,

629
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:31,861
and in a few weeks' time,
everybody would just forget about it.

630
00:54:31,931 --> 00:54:33,831
Man...

631
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,527
Then I gave her a piece of gum.

632
00:54:36,903 --> 00:54:38,962
- We should go.
- Yeah.

633
00:54:39,939 --> 00:54:43,102
- Wanna come back tomorrow?
- Can't. I got chores.

634
00:54:43,176 --> 00:54:46,043
- How about the next day?
- Sunday we go to church.

635
00:54:46,112 --> 00:54:48,171
- Can I come?
- You'd hate it.

636
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:51,774
- No, I think it'd be cool.
- Uh, girls can't wear pants.

637
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:56,220
- I've got dresses, Jess.
- You in a dress? That'd be a sight!

638
00:54:56,823 --> 00:54:57,915
See ya!

639
00:55:49,242 --> 00:55:52,336
That's what we need.
Bells... in Terabithia.

640
00:55:57,316 --> 00:55:59,284
I'm really glad I came.

641
00:55:59,352 --> 00:56:02,253
That whole Jesus thing,
it's really interesting.

642
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:04,687
It's not interesting.
It's scary!

643
00:56:04,757 --> 00:56:07,157
It's nailing holes through your hands.

644
00:56:07,226 --> 00:56:10,923
It's 'cause we're all vile sinners.
God made Jesus die.

645
00:56:10,997 --> 00:56:13,864
- You really think that's true?
- It's in the Bible.

646
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,493
You have to believe it,
and you hate it.

647
00:56:17,136 --> 00:56:20,299
I don't have to believe it,
and I think it's beautiful.

648
00:56:20,373 --> 00:56:23,206
- You gotta believe the Bible, Leslie.
- Why?

649
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:26,006
'Cause if you
don't believe in the Bible,

650
00:56:26,078 --> 00:56:28,239
God will damn you to hell when you die.

651
00:56:28,314 --> 00:56:30,509
May Belle, where'd you hear that?

652
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:32,380
That's right, huh, Jess?

653
00:56:32,451 --> 00:56:36,649
God damns you to hell
if you don't believe in the Bible.

654
00:56:36,722 --> 00:56:39,190
- I think so.
- Well, I don't think so.

655
00:56:39,258 --> 00:56:43,092
I seriously do not think God
goes around damning people to hell.

656
00:56:43,162 --> 00:56:45,824
He's too busy running all this.

657
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:54,773
Hey, Jess.
Give me a hand.

658
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:57,977
Yeah. I'm coming.

659
00:56:59,912 --> 00:57:02,176
Get my drill out of the greenhouse.

660
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:22,757
You haven't managed to kill those yet?

661
00:57:22,835 --> 00:57:24,564
Not funny.

662
00:57:24,637 --> 00:57:25,831
Look.

663
00:57:26,472 --> 00:57:28,608
Ever thought of
putting them in the sun?

664
00:57:43,222 --> 00:57:45,690
Jess. Jess.

665
00:57:45,758 --> 00:57:49,023
- Where are my keys?
- What?

666
00:57:49,095 --> 00:57:52,030
My keys. You never gave them back to me.

667
00:57:59,939 --> 00:58:01,873
- Think!
- I put the drill down here.

668
00:58:01,941 --> 00:58:05,138
Damn it, the keys to the store
are on it, the register, all of it.

669
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:08,237
They have to replace those locks,
$ 700 out of my paycheck.

670
00:58:08,314 --> 00:58:09,872
They gotta be right here.

671
00:58:09,949 --> 00:58:13,214
- If I don't have those keys...
- I'll find them, Dad. I promise.

672
00:58:13,286 --> 00:58:16,517
Why don't you draw me some money
to pay for it? How about that?

673
00:58:16,589 --> 00:58:18,784
Make yourself useful,
draw me some money.

674
00:58:18,858 --> 00:58:20,291
I said I'll find them.

675
00:58:25,064 --> 00:58:28,693
You look awful.
What's the matter?

676
00:58:28,768 --> 00:58:30,668
I lost the keys where my dad works,

677
00:58:30,736 --> 00:58:33,534
and now he has to get
new keys made, and locks.

678
00:58:33,606 --> 00:58:35,233
May Belle?

679
00:58:35,308 --> 00:58:37,708
Please don't anyone get mad at me.

680
00:58:37,777 --> 00:58:40,143
- What?
- He...

681
00:58:40,212 --> 00:58:43,443
- I know where your dad's keys are.
- You do?

682
00:58:44,116 --> 00:58:46,880
You know the bells
we talked about making?

683
00:58:46,953 --> 00:58:50,286
Well, it was meant to be a surprise.

684
00:58:50,356 --> 00:58:52,290
All that clanking metal and junk.

685
00:58:52,358 --> 00:58:55,020
And... May Belle wanted to help.

686
00:58:55,094 --> 00:58:56,618
And you let her?

687
00:58:58,164 --> 00:59:00,632
Why did you tell me
you found them on the ground?

688
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,260
- They were.
- On the ground in the greenhouse.

689
00:59:03,336 --> 00:59:05,804
What's the matter with you?
Dad wants to kill me.

690
00:59:05,871 --> 00:59:08,465
I was waiting for the right time.

691
00:59:10,977 --> 00:59:12,945
So you know where the keys are?

692
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:24,819
See ya later.

693
00:59:27,493 --> 00:59:30,758
- Tell Mom I'll be home in a bit.
- Are you gonna tell Dad it was me?

694
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:34,197
Don't worry. It's my job
to get Dad's keys back. See you later.

695
00:59:43,576 --> 00:59:46,739
Look how high it got.
Come on. Let's go.

696
00:59:51,584 --> 00:59:54,815
"Get your head out of the clouds, boy.
Draw me some money.

697
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:58,448
- Make yourself useful, draw me money."
- What are you going on about?

698
00:59:58,524 --> 01:00:01,584
"This isn't one of your cartoons.
This is serious."

699
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:05,994
What's so great about being serious
all the time anyway? Tell me that.

700
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,861
What if the Dark Master
gets the keys first?

701
01:00:13,939 --> 01:00:17,170
I'm not scared of any Dark Master,
and those are my dad's keys.

702
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:33,080
Leslie, get behind me.

703
01:00:35,461 --> 01:00:37,554
Jess, turn around. There's more.

704
01:00:38,864 --> 01:00:40,263
Here, take this.

705
01:00:43,869 --> 01:00:45,860
Jess!

706
01:00:55,981 --> 01:00:57,209
P.T., get him!

707
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:07,016
Good boy, P.T.

708
01:01:19,905 --> 01:01:20,929
Yeah!

709
01:01:21,006 --> 01:01:24,305
Dead meat! Dead meat! Dead meat!

710
01:01:27,213 --> 01:01:28,271
Run!

711
01:01:29,115 --> 01:01:30,946
Come on! Faster!

712
01:01:31,016 --> 01:01:33,917
Dead meat! Dead meat!

713
01:01:36,122 --> 01:01:37,419
Dead meat! Dead meat!

714
01:01:43,195 --> 01:01:44,787
Told you they were grenades.

715
01:01:53,139 --> 01:01:54,265
Jess!

716
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,069
I got you, Leslie!

717
01:01:57,009 --> 01:01:58,169
I got you!

718
01:01:59,712 --> 01:02:01,646
Up ahead! Get ready!

719
01:02:06,752 --> 01:02:10,586
- They'll catch us.
- We're the fastest in Terabithia.

720
01:02:20,533 --> 01:02:22,194
He's watching us.

721
01:02:25,804 --> 01:02:27,601
Where are the keys?

722
01:02:27,673 --> 01:02:29,903
Here, open this.

723
01:02:42,588 --> 01:02:45,216
Where are Terabithian warriors
when you need them?

724
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:47,156
I don't know.

725
01:02:50,796 --> 01:02:52,889
Great. Now there's three of us.

726
01:02:59,772 --> 01:03:02,400
Now we're even.

727
01:03:02,474 --> 01:03:03,907
Attack!

728
01:03:13,118 --> 01:03:17,350
Dead meat! Dead meat!
Dead meat! Dead meat! Dead meat!

729
01:03:18,857 --> 01:03:19,846
Come on.

730
01:03:20,526 --> 01:03:23,962
- Come on, P.T.
- Dead meat!

731
01:03:46,652 --> 01:03:49,177
Be careful!
You're almost there.

732
01:03:56,428 --> 01:03:58,760
Jess!

733
01:03:59,298 --> 01:04:00,560
Jess!

734
01:04:18,884 --> 01:04:20,010
Hey.

735
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:12,094
- See ya!
- Yeah, see ya.

736
01:06:02,721 --> 01:06:05,246
Jess! I called you three times.

737
01:06:05,324 --> 01:06:06,552
It's your girlfriend.

738
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:08,718
She's not my girlfriend.

739
01:06:09,795 --> 01:06:11,922
- Hey.
- Hello, Jess.

740
01:06:11,997 --> 01:06:14,022
Wait. Who is this?

741
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:16,727
It's Saturday, but it's
your teacher, Ms. Edmunds.

742
01:06:16,802 --> 01:06:21,205
I was planning on taking my nephews
into the city to the museum,

743
01:06:21,273 --> 01:06:25,175
and my sister changed her plans
last minute, so I had a thought.

744
01:06:29,648 --> 01:06:32,446
- Hey, Mom.
- Is it the baby?

745
01:06:32,518 --> 01:06:35,248
No, she's fine.
May Belle's got her.

746
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,847
Teacher wants me to go
on a field trip today.

747
01:06:38,924 --> 01:06:41,722
Is that OK?

748
01:06:46,031 --> 01:06:47,931
Ms. Edmunds? Yeah, I can go.

749
01:06:56,175 --> 01:06:57,938
- All set?
- Yeah.

750
01:06:58,010 --> 01:06:59,409
- Yeah?
- Yes, ma'am.

751
01:07:06,685 --> 01:07:08,619
Forget something?

752
01:07:10,589 --> 01:07:12,921
No. I'm good.

753
01:07:56,168 --> 01:07:57,829
Honey, honey, stay here.

754
01:08:01,073 --> 01:08:03,633
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

755
01:08:03,709 --> 01:08:06,803
It's Brueghel.
It's one of my favorites.

756
01:08:06,879 --> 01:08:10,246
I wonder if he started in notebooks
like you. I know da Vinci did.

757
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:18,147
It's amazing how much
detail's put into it.

758
01:08:18,223 --> 01:08:20,555
You've been to a museum before, right?

759
01:08:20,626 --> 01:08:24,062
- No, it's my first time.
- Really?

760
01:08:24,129 --> 01:08:26,859
- Yup.
- Well, then I'm honored.

761
01:09:06,438 --> 01:09:08,269
It's such a nice day out.

762
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:12,640
It's been raining so much, I began
to think it was like that Japanese myth

763
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:16,704
where the sun goes into the cave
and vows never to come out.

764
01:09:16,782 --> 01:09:20,013
- You know about everything.
- Not by a long shot.

765
01:09:20,085 --> 01:09:22,110
But I do try to keep an open mind,

766
01:09:22,187 --> 01:09:24,781
and you'd be surprised
what finds its way in there.

767
01:09:24,856 --> 01:09:28,519
That's what Leslie Burke says.
She told me to keep my mind wide open.

768
01:09:28,594 --> 01:09:30,255
Leslie Burke is right.

769
01:09:30,329 --> 01:09:33,992
Mind like yours wide open,
you could create a whole new world.

770
01:09:41,873 --> 01:09:45,741
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.

771
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:49,440
- Maybe we could do this again sometime.
- Absolutely.

772
01:09:54,252 --> 01:09:56,720
- Hey, guys.
- See? I told you.

773
01:09:56,788 --> 01:09:58,847
Oh, my God, Jess!

774
01:10:00,525 --> 01:10:03,790
- Where in God's name have you been?
- Where have you been?

775
01:10:04,963 --> 01:10:07,295
Mom...

776
01:10:07,366 --> 01:10:09,857
I asked you. It wasn't like I...

777
01:10:09,935 --> 01:10:12,631
- They thought you were dead.
- Brenda, hush.

778
01:10:12,704 --> 01:10:14,501
Dead?

779
01:10:15,707 --> 01:10:17,470
What's going on?

780
01:10:24,249 --> 01:10:26,649
Your friend Leslie's dead.

781
01:10:28,487 --> 01:10:30,318
She drowned in a creek this morning.

782
01:10:30,389 --> 01:10:34,018
Apparently she tried to swing
across on a rope and it broke.

783
01:10:34,092 --> 01:10:36,322
They think she hit her head.

784
01:10:38,163 --> 01:10:41,621
No... No, it's not that kind of rope.

785
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:45,329
It couldn't break.
It... wouldn't have.

786
01:10:45,404 --> 01:10:47,429
But it did.

787
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:54,338
- I'm sorry, son.
- No, you're lying.

788
01:10:55,247 --> 01:10:59,274
- She's not even dead. You're lying!
- Jess!

789
01:12:33,578 --> 01:12:36,843
Hi, honey. You want some breakfast?

790
01:12:36,915 --> 01:12:39,679
I gotta do my chores first.

791
01:12:39,751 --> 01:12:42,515
Your dad's doing everything today.
You just sit down.

792
01:12:58,537 --> 01:13:00,300
Jess, your father and I thought

793
01:13:00,372 --> 01:13:03,034
we'd go to the Burkes today
and pay our respects.

794
01:13:03,108 --> 01:13:05,440
Just the three of us.

795
01:13:06,478 --> 01:13:07,911
Paying what?

796
01:13:29,367 --> 01:13:31,130
Prince Terrien. Shh.

797
01:13:32,037 --> 01:13:33,971
You must be Jess.

798
01:13:43,181 --> 01:13:47,914
I'm Mr. Aarons. This is my wife, Mary.
Very sorry about your loss.

799
01:13:47,986 --> 01:13:50,511
- I'm so sorry.
- Hi, Jess.

800
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:00,521
She loved you, you know.

801
01:14:01,533 --> 01:14:03,023
You know, Leslie,

802
01:14:03,101 --> 01:14:07,060
she never had much luck
making friends at her old school.

803
01:14:07,138 --> 01:14:10,471
We were hoping that when
we moved out here she would...

804
01:14:14,713 --> 01:14:17,147
She said if it wasn't for you...

805
01:14:19,551 --> 01:14:21,815
You're the best friend she's ever had.

806
01:14:21,887 --> 01:14:23,855
I wanna thank you for that.

807
01:14:25,357 --> 01:14:27,416
You're welcome.

808
01:14:30,528 --> 01:14:33,520
My wife and I were wondering
about the service.

809
01:14:37,068 --> 01:14:40,663
We've decided to bring Leslie
back home until the service.

810
01:14:46,411 --> 01:14:50,404
- Jess.
- Next time,

811
01:14:50,482 --> 01:14:53,474
we should invite Leslie to go.

812
01:14:55,353 --> 01:14:57,548
She'd like that.

813
01:15:07,032 --> 01:15:08,556
Hey, kid.

814
01:15:10,001 --> 01:15:12,162
Sorry about your friend.

815
01:15:14,639 --> 01:15:19,167
The purpose of object pronouns...

816
01:15:19,244 --> 01:15:22,372
So looks like you're
the fastest kid in the class now, huh?

817
01:15:24,749 --> 01:15:26,842
It's a joke, dude.

818
01:15:31,423 --> 01:15:33,448
- Are you nuts?
- Jess Aarons.

819
01:15:34,059 --> 01:15:36,152
Go wait for me out in the hall.

820
01:15:37,595 --> 01:15:40,029
Silent reading until I get back.

821
01:15:49,407 --> 01:15:51,136
Jess...

822
01:15:57,816 --> 01:16:00,717
When my husband died...

823
01:16:00,785 --> 01:16:03,777
...people kept telling me not to cry.

824
01:16:04,889 --> 01:16:07,289
People kept trying to help me to forget.

825
01:16:10,595 --> 01:16:12,927
But I didn't wanna forget.

826
01:16:12,998 --> 01:16:15,330
Excuse me.

827
01:16:18,103 --> 01:16:20,697
The things that girl came up with.

828
01:16:22,741 --> 01:16:25,335
I don't get students like her too often.

829
01:16:29,914 --> 01:16:32,382
So I realize...

830
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:35,180
...that if it's hard for me...

831
01:16:35,253 --> 01:16:37,778
...how much harder it must be for you.

832
01:17:25,403 --> 01:17:27,564
Hurry up.
We're gonna miss the bus!

833
01:17:36,948 --> 01:17:38,711
Hey.

834
01:18:25,897 --> 01:18:27,956
Leslie?!

835
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:54,817
Jess!

836
01:18:54,893 --> 01:18:56,417
Leslie!

837
01:18:56,494 --> 01:18:59,930
- Jess!
- Leslie!

838
01:19:06,404 --> 01:19:08,031
Lesl...

839
01:19:08,106 --> 01:19:11,098
Help me, I can't get across! Hurry!

840
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:14,278
May Belle?

841
01:19:16,714 --> 01:19:18,909
Hold on! Don't move!

842
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:23,043
Here, grab my arm.
I got you, don't worry.

843
01:19:28,393 --> 01:19:30,953
- What were you thinking?
- I was worried about you!

844
01:19:31,029 --> 01:19:33,827
Well, don't be. I don't want you here!

845
01:19:34,432 --> 01:19:37,230
- But I wanna come with you.
- This is our place. Go home.

846
01:19:37,302 --> 01:19:39,167
This is our place!

847
01:19:43,308 --> 01:19:44,673
I said go home!

848
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:01,656
Honey, what's the matter?

849
01:20:02,627 --> 01:20:04,595
What's the matter?

850
01:20:04,662 --> 01:20:06,596
What's the matter, baby?

851
01:21:11,262 --> 01:21:12,991
No!

852
01:21:14,565 --> 01:21:16,294
Jess!

853
01:21:17,302 --> 01:21:20,066
It's OK, Jess.
It's OK, son, it's OK.

854
01:21:20,138 --> 01:21:21,935
It's all gone.

855
01:21:25,410 --> 01:21:27,878
Is it like the Bible says?

856
01:21:27,945 --> 01:21:29,845
Is she going to hell?

857
01:21:30,548 --> 01:21:32,345
I don't know everything about God,

858
01:21:32,417 --> 01:21:35,284
but I do know He's not
gonna send that little girl to hell.

859
01:21:35,353 --> 01:21:38,720
Then I'm going to hell
because it's all my fault.

860
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:42,487
Don't you think that even for a minute.

861
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,188
But it is.

862
01:21:45,263 --> 01:21:49,495
I didn't invite her
to go to the museum with me.

863
01:21:49,567 --> 01:21:52,900
I didn't wanna invite her.

864
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:56,269
I wasn't there to go with her.

865
01:21:56,341 --> 01:21:59,469
- It's my fault.
- No, no, no, no.

866
01:21:59,544 --> 01:22:01,705
It's not your fault.

867
01:22:01,779 --> 01:22:04,407
None of that makes it so.

868
01:22:04,482 --> 01:22:06,677
It's a terrible thing.

869
01:22:06,751 --> 01:22:11,381
It doesn't make any sense,
but it's not your fault, Jess.

870
01:22:16,427 --> 01:22:20,090
She brought you something special
when she came here, didn't she?

871
01:22:23,267 --> 01:22:25,667
That's what you hold on to.

872
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:31,231
That's how you keep her alive.

873
01:22:51,496 --> 01:22:52,827
May Belle?

874
01:23:01,572 --> 01:23:02,937
Look.

875
01:23:04,742 --> 01:23:06,607
I'm sorry I pushed you.

876
01:23:08,813 --> 01:23:12,078
That was stupid and wrong...

877
01:23:14,185 --> 01:23:16,278
...and I really miss you talking to me.

878
01:23:56,694 --> 01:23:59,128
She's in your hands now.

879
01:24:22,386 --> 01:24:23,512
Hey!

880
01:24:25,356 --> 01:24:26,618
Wait!

881
01:24:28,693 --> 01:24:29,717
Wait!

882
01:24:32,029 --> 01:24:33,428
Hey!

883
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:42,430
Jess? I'm sorry.
I didn't... I didn't see you.

884
01:24:42,507 --> 01:24:46,273
Can I use the lumber by your house?

885
01:24:46,344 --> 01:24:48,039
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

886
01:24:48,112 --> 01:24:50,842
Anything you see, you just...

887
01:24:51,716 --> 01:24:55,083
You know, I meant to...
I meant to give you Prince Terrien,

888
01:24:55,152 --> 01:24:58,383
but I... can't seem to give him up.

889
01:25:00,224 --> 01:25:02,283
Leslie would've wanted you to have him.

890
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,918
Yeah.

891
01:26:27,411 --> 01:26:30,778
We're playing. By ourselves.

892
01:26:32,316 --> 01:26:36,275
OK, but I know the most
incredible place to play.

893
01:26:36,354 --> 01:26:39,414
You gotta promise you're
not gonna tell anybody about it.

894
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:43,620
Not Brenda, not Ellie, not even Joycie.

895
01:26:43,694 --> 01:26:47,289
Tell Joycie a secret between you and me?

896
01:26:47,365 --> 01:26:48,889
She's nothing but a baby.

897
01:26:48,966 --> 01:26:52,231
You're right, and she's not ready
to be a princess yet.

898
01:26:52,303 --> 01:26:54,168
You have to train her and stuff.

899
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:57,264
Princess? Who gets to be the princess?

900
01:27:07,051 --> 01:27:08,780
Step down.

901
01:27:12,256 --> 01:27:13,655
Watch your step.

902
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:22,995
You're not peeking, are you?

903
01:27:25,102 --> 01:27:27,900
Step up. There you go.

904
01:27:35,312 --> 01:27:37,109
All right.

905
01:27:43,554 --> 01:27:45,522
OK. Open them.

906
01:27:51,295 --> 01:27:55,356
Did you make this?

907
01:27:56,801 --> 01:27:58,496
Yep.

908
01:28:01,338 --> 01:28:03,135
Hold on a second.

909
01:28:11,816 --> 01:28:15,183
Look! They must've heard the rumor,

910
01:28:15,252 --> 01:28:20,019
that the beautiful girl arriving today
is the new future ruler of Terabithia.

911
01:28:20,091 --> 01:28:23,424
- Who heard?
- The Terabithians.

912
01:28:23,494 --> 01:28:25,758
They've been waiting.

913
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:27,821
Where?

914
01:28:27,898 --> 01:28:31,356
- I don't see them.
- It's an ancient forest, May Belle,

915
01:28:31,435 --> 01:28:33,835
full of magical creatures
and friendly giants,

916
01:28:33,904 --> 01:28:36,202
anything you can imagine.

917
01:28:36,273 --> 01:28:38,241
But you gotta look really hard.

918
01:28:38,309 --> 01:28:41,210
But keep your mind wide open.

919
01:28:49,854 --> 01:28:51,685
So, what do you think?

920
01:28:56,093 --> 01:28:58,527
Can there be purple flowers?

921
01:29:00,631 --> 01:29:03,065
Anything you want.

922
01:29:07,438 --> 01:29:08,735
And a castle.

923
01:29:08,806 --> 01:29:11,604
A big one, with towers and flags.

924
01:29:11,675 --> 01:29:14,007
Of course.

925
01:29:16,814 --> 01:29:19,647
Look, Jess. It's beautiful.

926
01:29:23,554 --> 01:29:25,249
Is there a king?

927
01:29:25,322 --> 01:29:26,755
Are you the king, Jess?

928
01:29:26,824 --> 01:29:29,418
Only if you're princess.

929
01:30:15,005 --> 01:30:17,371
Terabithia.
