- Not at all.

- Mm-hm.

- Catholic.
- Mm-hm.

201
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:28,820
OK, Adam, I have a series
of abstract images here.

Nope.

No. This is their natural colour.

a mental picture of David

488
00:39:25,258 --> 00:39:29,177
so that no matter where he went,
no matter how horrific things became,

he must be fully aware of it

cannot be disassociated.

- I just met Wes!

Wh...

630
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:27,375
Why, Dad? Why?
Why do you do this to me?

631
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,795
Because you've stopped
asking questions.

632
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:32,130
That's all I do. That's all I do all day long.

633

- That's all I do, Dad.
- No, no!

634
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:37,259
You've stopped asking questions
of yourself, Caroline!

635
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:41,305
You've developed
this fixed system of beliefs

636
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:44,433
which you refuse to submit
to any kind of introspection.

637
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,018
So what that means is
that you will never have

638
00:51:47,186 --> 00:51:49,020
a new thought in your professional life.

639
00:51:49,188 --> 00:51:52,398
You have got to learn to
take those ideas, set them to one side

640
00:51:52,566 --> 00:51:56,653
and try to move ahead with
one big question, which is, "Why?"!

641
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:00,697
And simply ask, "What?"
To just say, "I don't know."

642
00:52:00,865 --> 00:52:02,825
Just because you're older,
it doesn't mean you're right.

643
00:52:02,992 --> 00:52:05,410
It might mean
that you've been wrong for longer.

644
00:52:06,913 --> 00:52:08,372
What has been your motivation here?

645
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:11,249
Has it been to help Adam
to discover whatever...

646
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:14,502
...crisis it is that caused him
to fracture his psyche?

647
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:19,590
Or has it been to simply flat out
prove me wrong?

648
00:52:23,427 --> 00:52:24,970
Hmm?

00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,683

00:52:54,914 --> 00:52:58,458

for an underground rock band.

00:52:58,626 --> 00:53:01,587
He died November 1994.

654
00:53:01,754 --> 00:53:03,505
It was a possible suicide.

655
00:53:03,673 --> 00:53:09,887
At this exact point,
Adam Saber is in prison.

in solitary confinement.

who has a story worse than his own.
