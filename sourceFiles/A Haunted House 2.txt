1
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,975
Help me get her in the car, Ray!

2
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,760
Okay, but this bitch
heavy as hell, cuz!

3
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,295
Nigga,
get your hands off her ass!

4
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,215
Let me finger
gangbang her at least, homie!

5
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,455
Just help me
get her to the hospital!

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,680
- Okay, one finger then!
- Ray!

7
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,495
All right, but we
ain't goin' inside, homie.

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,249
We gonna go around
the emergency loop,

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,015
roll her ass out like
we do all the homies

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,565
that get shot
in the hood, homie.

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,564
Why you snuff her fine ass anyway, homie?
I wanted to bone, cuz.

12
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,768
She was possessed, Ray!
Possessed?

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,495
Possessed like head
spinnin' around

14
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,760
vomitin' everywhere, possessed?

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,335
Or like possessed like Kanye

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,600
when you take a picture of him?

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,295
Just drive like
you got warrants, please!

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,321
Nigga, I do got warrants!

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,404
Look! These right here!
Jaywalkin'!

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,040
For eating grapes in the grocery
store without payin' for 'em!

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,095
Shavin' my dog's
balls in public.

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,849
Drivin' with my hands
off the wheel, cuz.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,495
I be ghost-ridin'
my whip, cuz.

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,975
I like doin' that shit, homie.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,571
An altercation with my moms,
homie, but she provoked me, cuz!

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,935
Ray-Ray, I think she's waking.
All right, here! Take this

27
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,895
and pistol-whip her
with the butt of the gun.

28
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,490
I'm not pistol-whippin'
my girlfriend!

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,200
All right, nigga, well, you drive
and I'll pistol-whip that bitch!

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,811
Kisha, resist!

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,445
But you didn't!

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,968
I've seen you for the bitch that
you are, Malcolm.

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,529
What's she talkin' about, homie?
Booty pirates!

34
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,724
Nothing, she's possessed, man.
That's right, you fucker!

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,975
He's a Ghostbuster!

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,729
That sound real suspect
back there, homie.

37
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,375
Was you in juvie, cuz?

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,482
If you don't cry, you ain't
no bitch in there, homie.

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,769
I didn't cry. Doodles on they dick.
Joke's on them, cuz.

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,207
By the powers vested to me,

41
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,561
that somebody gave me
while I was locked up...

42
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,405
Who are you?
It's Father Williams, homie.

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,455
She do a mean impression
of that nigga, cuz.

44
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,562
I do a mean impression
of The Butler. Check it.

45
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,935
"I'm here for the boss.
I'm here to serve the boss."

46
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,255
Who are you?
I'm Forest Whitaker, homie.

47
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,415
From the movie
that's like The Help,

48
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,095
but he didn't doo-doo
in the pie, homie.

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,455
Ray, I'm not talkin' to you!
I'm talkin' to Kisha.

50
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,535
Ray!

51
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,575
Are you gonna let that bitch
choke you out, cuz?

52
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,648
You a bitch, homie...

53
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,095
Get the fuck off me!

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,009
Kisha! Kisha!

55
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,935
Oh, shit, she breathed
in my face, homie.

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,849
I'll get the bird flu,
it's contagious...

57
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,175
She blacked out, Ray.

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,201
Hurry, we don't have much time!

59
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,970
Get us to the hospital. Hurry!

60
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,561
Ray? Ray?

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,615
Oh, shit!

62
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,287
Oh, my God!
Kisha? Kisha!

63
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,801
Ray?

64
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,645
Ray!

65
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,575
It's a good thing I drank
that Hennessy earlier.

66
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,965
I can't feel shit, homie!

67
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,455
I think Kisha's dead.

68
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,528
Good! Let's get the fuck
outta here, homie!

69
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,123
Listen.
We were never here.

70
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,644
I'm with you, cuz.
All right. Deuces!

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,849
We ghost hunters!

72
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,120
I don't know
about this place, baby.

73
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,375
You've said that about
every house we looked at.

74
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,455
There's just something creepy
about this place, like...

75
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,640
Give me the heebie-jeebies...

76
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,768
Like somethin' bad
happened in here.

77
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,402
Well, I love it.
And I love you.

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,895
There you go, bribin' me with vagina.
Whatever works.

79
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,495
Know when I'm weak.

80
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,931
Disgusting.

81
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,295
Oh, it's disgusting
when we do it,

82
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,255
but when you kissing the whole
entire sophomore class,

83
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,281
it's cool, huh?

84
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,602
Give me that damn camera,
you little gnat!

85
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,215
Oh, finger.
Real creative. Wow.

86
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,321
Cut her some slack.

87
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,695
She's just goin'
through a phase.

88
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,529
Yeah, a phase.
It's called "whore."

89
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,764
Look at that. Last a lifetime.
Malcolm, stop!

90
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,495
No, see, that's a phase.

91
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,735
Looks like
he met an imaginary friend.

92
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,807
It's normal.

93
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,535
What you doin' there, buddy?

94
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,925
Want to help me load some boxes?

95
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,003
Cool!
All right. My man!

96
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,735
Sorry, Malcolm. I can't.

97
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,921
Why not?

98
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,851
Tony says, "Aw, hell no!
I ain't yo' slave!"

99
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,975
Is it me or does his
imaginary friend sound black?

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,001
Pretty progressive.

101
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,895
Why don't you
and your friend go play?

102
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,967
Okay.

103
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,495
That game sounds like fun!

104
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,851
Oh!

105
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,966
I don't like
the tripping game, Tony.

106
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,963
Look at all that sexy.
Come here. Give me a kiss.

107
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,646
Let's piss off your forefathers.

108
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,935
Malcolm, it's 2013. Interracial
relationships are not a big deal anymore.

109
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,375
Yeah, you tell that
to the sistas.

110
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,961
You know, they be like,
"I know he didn't!"

111
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,642
"He did not kiss that pasty
ass white bitch!" Pasty?

112
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,855
"Yes! Not with them
old thin ass lips."

113
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,455
"Look at them,
look like baloney slices!"

114
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,495
"Uh-uh.
See he straight scrippin'"

115
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,975
"and it don't make
no damn sense."

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,095
Come here, Shiloh Junior.

117
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,246
There's my baby boy.

118
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,855
I still can't believe

119
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,689
you named our dog Shiloh Junior.

120
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,128
Well, I was gonna name him
Shiloh Two or Shiloh the Sequel,

121
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,767
but he wouldn't answer to
those, so, Shiloh Junior it is.

122
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,764
C'mon! Hey, come on,
Shiloh Junior.

123
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,055
Hey, babe, are you gettin' this?

124
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,175
I really don't understand

125
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,531
your obsession
with all these cameras.

126
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,762
Hey, you can never have
too many cameras, okay?

127
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,055
Hey, Shiloh! Come on, baby.

128
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,889
You ready to go see
your new house, Shiloh Junior?

129
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,850
Come on, Shiloh Junior. Shiloh Junior!
Hey, get inside.

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,215
Don't make me put bass
in my voice.

131
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,969
Hey! Shiloh!

132
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,969
God, I don't know
what's wrong with him.

133
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,401
Oh, fucking...

134
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,415
Oh, shit!
Oh, breathe!

135
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,727
Come on, Shiloh!
Don't go towards the light!

136
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,535
Call 9-1-1.

137
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,642
Tell 'em the dog is white!
Tell 'em the dog is white!

138
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,808
Oh, God. I got a pulse.

139
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,201
Breathe! Shiloh, like this.

140
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,646
Fuck! Oh, my back!
Oh, my fuckin' back!

141
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,245
Please, help me!

142
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,201
My fuckin' dog is a pancake!

143
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,330
Get me a goddamn pump!

144
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,935
It's working! Come on!

145
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,208
Meet me at the hospital!

146
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,490
The hospital's that way!

147
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,166
So young, never had
a chance to lick his balls.

148
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,005
I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm good.

149
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,050
You know, I'm just so happy
I got to spend time with...

150
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,602
It's just every time I try
and say the name...

151
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,602
Shiloh!

152
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,203
Oh, God, it hurts!
Oh, God!

153
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,335
It's tingly in...

154
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,124
Oh, God!

155
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,690
I'm goin' with you! Oh, God!
It's time to go bye-bye.

156
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,963
Shiloh!

157
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,122
Junior.

158
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,527
Hey.

159
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,455
I bet you could put a whole
lot of birth control in that.

160
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,811
I really hate you.

161
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,043
That's what your daddy said.
That's why the nigga gone.

162
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,735
What've you got there?

163
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,808
Just an old box
that I found in the basement.

164
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,042
Don't you think we should
return it to the prior owners?

165
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,495
If they wanted it,
they would've taken it

166
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,329
in the first place.
Ooh.

167
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,406
Okay, look, Becky,
I'm not your dad.

168
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,082
I'm just the guy
that's like... Your mom.

169
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,641
So I'll make you a deal.
I'll let you keep the box

170
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,844
if you promise to try and make this
work between me and you, okay?

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,401
It's for your mom.
Fine.

172
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,889
I think we're gettin' somewhere.

173
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,135
I'm just messin' with you, Bro.

174
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,241
Oh, shit!

175
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,895
I just do that when I'm talkin'
to Negritos. It's all good.

176
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,415
Did he just call me a nigger?
What's goin' on, Bro?

177
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,522
I just moved in with
my girl right here

178
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,815
and we was just wonderin' Hi.

179
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,895
Maybe if you want
to add us to your route?

180
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,049
Are you serious? Dude, I live here, Puto!
It's my house!

181
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,009
- Oh, shit! I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

182
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,415
I just assumed... You got
the gloves and the hat,

183
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,885
and the lawnmower and the truck.

184
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,328
Oh, 'cause I'm Mexican I must be José!
Are you?

185
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,935
No, fool!
My name is Miguel!

186
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,961
Is that your truck?

187
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,686
- Yeah, that's my truck!
- Then who's Jose?

188
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,735
That's my middle name.
You wanna guess my last name?

189
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,935
No, no, no.
Oh, come on.

190
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,255
You guys are here,
you might as well.

191
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,335
I don't know. Rodriguez?

192
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,415
That's racist, Bro.

193
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,044
You asked...
Did he ask me or what?

194
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,123
I'm just fuckin' with you!

195
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,490
For the record, my name is
Miguel Jose Jesus Gonzalez...

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,161
Smith.

197
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,655
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

198
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,808
Your last name is Smith?

199
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,361
Yeah, I'm Mexican
on my mom's side.

200
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,724
So, why is there
Gonzalez on your truck?

201
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,360
Shit, would you trust your
garden to a guy named Smith?

202
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,855
True. True.
Huh?

203
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,723
Hey, my name is Malcolm, Bro.
Yeah.

204
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,375
I bet your last name is Johnson.

205
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,925
See, that's some racist shit!

206
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,924
Am I right?
But you're right!

207
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,888
Nice to meet you, man. Yeah,
it's a pleasure meeting you!

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,375
Nice to meet you. Tuesdays.
I can cut your grass on Tuesdays.

209
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,735
What can I say, I'm a
gardener by ethnic default.

210
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,135
Be good, negrito!

211
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,242
Watch out, güera!

212
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,815
Hey. What?

213
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,975
You gon' try
and tease a brother?

214
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,081
That's an invite?

215
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,241
Come here, let's do the quickie.

216
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,930
One, two, I'm done.

217
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,975
What's that?
What?

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,968
Oh! That's Abigail.
Ew.

219
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,975
I found her in the wardrobe
that was left here.

220
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,175
Yeah, well, put it back.

221
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,009
Hey, stop! She's creepy!

222
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,168
We look alike.
Yeah, same eyes and pigtails.

223
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,368
Wait, no, no,
don't put it on the bed!

224
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,961
Hey.

225
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,451
How you doin'?

226
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,095
You ain't gonna
say nothin', huh?

227
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,521
Girl, you stupid.

228
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,406
You don't want none of this?
Come here.

229
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,767
Oh, I can't play with it
but you can.

230
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,404
You gonna bite my lip?
Take that!

231
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,575
You fuckin' like this!

232
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,375
Uh-huh. It was gonna come.

233
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,004
It was gonna come!

234
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,775
Just wanna put the tip in.
I'm gonna put the tip in...

235
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,643
Ah! Ahh! Ahh!

236
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,122
Look at that.
Mmm. Uh-huh.

237
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,050
Mmm, yeah.

238
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,489
You got that goody. Bite the
pillow, bite that fuckin' pillow.

239
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,330
You gonna eat
my butt now. Oh, shit!

240
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,241
Nigga, she...
She lickin' that.

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,215
You taste like doo-doo.
But I love it!

242
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,735
You on the pill? I don't
want to get you pregnant.

243
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,055
You wanna make
little doll babies?

244
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,415
They gonna have my eyes
with your eyes...

245
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,335
Oh, you gonna give me splinters!

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,415
Fuck this shit.
I wanna cry! It feels so...

247
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,407
Don't look. Don't look.
Hold on a second.

248
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,963
This side is wet with soap,
this one is dry.

249
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,455
I'll clean you up, baby.

250
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,041
I mighta leaked in you. I don't know
if I came, I leaked a little bit.

251
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,775
That's all right.
You ain't even ovulatin'.

252
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,484
Why you trippin'?
Come on, stop worrying.

253
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,202
Honey, we're home!
Oh, shit! You gotta go!

254
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,244
- Shit! No!
- Malcolm!

255
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,775
Hi, honey! Um...

256
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,200
Hey, where are you?

257
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,242
You gotta go!
We... I'm just upstairs!

258
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,402
You gotta get outta here.

259
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,165
Fuck!

260
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,129
Ah! Shit!

261
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,807
Mmm.

262
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,607
"Hanging out."

263
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,322
Sounds a little soft
for my taste, but... Fuck it.

264
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,251
Yeah, I don't think
this is right.

265
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,362
Maybe I should
download the manual.

266
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,367
What the...

267
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,565
Great. Get up here.

268
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,255
Can't breathe.
Can't breathe.

269
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,964
Cut the camera.
Turn the camera off.

270
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,690
Wow.

271
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,248
I seen some shit, but that was...
That was crazy!

272
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,568
A demonic figure tried to
hang a family in the backyard.

273
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,215
I gotta keep this from
Megan and the kids.

274
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,695
Is it weird that
I was aroused by this?

275
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,695
Why is my dick
bending in my jeans?

276
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,166
Hello? Hello?

277
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,295
Twinkle, twinkle little star

278
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,482
Who is this? Hello!

279
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,602
It's a nigger.

280
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,160
Oh, that's a ugly motherfucker.

281
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,124
Is that Steven Tyler?

282
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,886
What the hell? Same tree!

283
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,524
Shit! Kisha?

284
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,082
Megan, what you doing? I almost
dumped the fuck out you!

285
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,040
You got to holler at me!
You can't just be walkin' up.

286
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,522
You gotta give me like a "whoop-ti-whoo,"
a "kakow!" or a "tsh-tsh"!

287
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,055
Just make your own up.
Please announce yourself!

288
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,095
Honey, you look like
you've seen a ghost.

289
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,963
I think I did.

290
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,335
Wait. So now
I look like a ghost.

291
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,805
Excuse me,
where you goin' with this?

292
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,202
So now I'm too pasty for you?

293
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,295
Malcolm, I can't do anything about that!
What do you mean?

294
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,615
Unless you want me to get
skin cancer from the sun.

295
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,295
And deep nasty wrinkles, and then
they'll have to give me chemo

296
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,846
and I'll lose all my hair, and then
I'll look like a nasty bald raisin!

297
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,455
Is that what you want?
Is that what you want?

298
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,051
No! I don't want you
to look like a raisin!

299
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,095
I don't like the raisin!
I don't like to date raisins!

300
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,055
I don't like the raisins
on Morgan Freeman's face!

301
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,295
I just don't like raisins.

302
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,055
I don't like the new ones
that Obama got,

303
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,411
the young raisins on his face!

304
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,975
I don't like raisins.

305
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,209
So please,
don't look like a raisin.

306
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,843
I need to go meditate and
get my chi back in alignment.

307
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,361
What chi? You were just...

308
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,495
Ah! Ahh!

309
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,046
Walk to the light!
It's bedtime.

310
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,415
What you all dressed up for?

311
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,646
We goin' to a club?
Mmm-mmm.

312
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,175
Foam party?
No.

313
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,175
We goin' to a pajama jammy jam?
Just bed.

314
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,255
Come on, Megan.

315
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,089
You gotta be more comfortable
with this relationship...

316
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,363
You're right. Put on some
sweat pants and some...

317
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,683
Oh, my Jesus Lord!
Um, you're naked!

318
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,455
I am.
Oh, wow.

319
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,007
I like being naked, though.
I could be naked all day.

320
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,209
All day? But come on,
that's not practical, hon.

321
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,535
You got a job.

322
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,564
You don't wanna be on the bus
naked or in Starbucks naked.

323
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,207
Why not? 'Cause that coffee
spill on you, it's hot!

324
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,735
It's gonna leave a scar.

325
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,935
Melt one of your
nipples off or somethin'.

326
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,961
Hey, hey, hey.

327
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,566
The camera's on, baby.

328
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,566
Good. Just make sure
you film my good side.

329
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,884
What the fuck?
Are you serious?

330
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,243
We gonna get all angles
on that... Oh, shit.

331
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,563
Baby, your creepy doll
is makin' my dick scared.

332
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,255
Just let her watch.

333
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,250
You just said the right
type of nasty shit!

334
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,244
Oh, God!
I gotta replenish my fluids.

335
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,922
After round two.

336
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,575
Whoo! Ah! Whoo!

337
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,080
- That was wild.
- Come on, Malcolm.

338
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,442
What, aren't you done yet?

339
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,295
I am now. Ready for round three?
Seriously...

340
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,415
Oh, my God!

341
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,283
Baby, you gotta train
for some shit like this!

342
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,975
Come on, Malcolm,
bell's ringing.

343
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,126
Time for round four.

344
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,965
No, no, baby. My ding-ding
is knocked out cold.

345
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,175
I can't do it.

346
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,415
Corner's throwin' in the towel!

347
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,441
Let's go, Malcolm.

348
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,295
I gotta get some Enswell
if we keep goin'!

349
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,695
Malcolm.
Wait, no, baby!

350
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,655
Right now she is tearin' me up!

351
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,284
Oh, my God!

352
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,810
Aw!

353
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,081
Want me to choke you?

354
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,486
Is that what you like?
Huh? Huh?

355
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,324
Stop being a bitch!

356
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,775
Yeah! Come on!

357
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,962
Oh! You want some of this?

358
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,322
You like that?
It's kind of like a blindfold

359
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,975
except you can't fuckin' breathe!
Huh? Are you crying?

360
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,490
That thing just moved!

361
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,535
Except you can't
fuckin' breathe!

362
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,483
Thing was watching!

363
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,008
You little...
Who was watching?

364
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,162
Oh, baby, come here.
Check this out!

365
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,489
Oh, my God!

366
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,775
Did you see it?

367
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,135
How could I not?
I thought I was trippin'!

368
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,255
I am so fat!
Look at me!

369
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,169
I look like a huge blubber ass!

370
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,895
I'm like Miss Piggy in there!

371
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,160
What're you talking about?

372
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,975
You said you were gonna
shoot my good side.

373
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,335
I did shoot your good side.

374
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,895
Look, I got all that
ass up in...

375
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,206
Look at all that ass, girl.

376
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,335
I'm black, brothers like an ass.

377
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,364
You know I do mean that
as a compliment, right?

378
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,335
I see what's going on.

379
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,655
You hate my vagina!
You think it's too loose!

380
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,335
It's not!
It's only on the outside,

381
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,415
but once you choose a wall,
it's pretty damn tight.

382
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,375
You know what, Malcolm,
I have had two kids!

383
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,335
I mean, do you think
the stork just dropped 'em off

384
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,361
on the doorstep?

385
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,335
No! You're knocked
up for nine months

386
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,335
and then your lady parts
are stretched to limits

387
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,647
you cannot even fathom!

388
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,280
Okay, baby.
I think your vagina's cute.

389
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,211
Erase the tape or we are
never having sex again.

390
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,408
Well, since you put it that way.
Erase the tape!

391
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,600
Okay, I'm erasin' the tape!
I want to see you do it.

392
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,087
I'm erasing the tape. I'm erasing it.
Erase it right now! Do it!

393
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,735
It's erasing. Baby, I like the
way it sounds. Erase the tape!

394
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,895
It's not loose!
I like the way it sounds!

395
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,285
Sound like a blown speaker.
Just...

396
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,560
You know, it's kinda like
Doug E. Fresh's beatbox.

397
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,769
When I'm hittin' it.
It's just...

398
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,535
Mmm...

399
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,246
Who the hell's hittin' me?
Abigail?

400
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,815
You got a page?

401
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,810
"In a relationship
with Malcolm Johnson"?

402
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,403
I only hit it once! 27,000 views?

403
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,495
What in the hell?

404
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,762
I think I might've
fucked the wrong bitch.

405
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,448
Now she's blowin' up
my cell phone? Look at that.

406
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,207
Straight up stalker!
She's crazy!

407
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,768
Listen, it's time to turn
my camera game up a level.

408
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,124
I'm talkin' bathrooms,
countertops, computers,

409
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,095
stuffed animals,
mouths and asses!

410
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,408
It's goin' down everywhere!
I'm gonna live.

411
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,444
Kitchen? Oh, yeah, I see you.

412
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,801
Uh-huh. Perfect.
Yeah, and I got the ass, too.

413
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,775
All inconspicuous.

414
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,327
Told you, cameras everywhere.

415
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,495
Hey, Becky,
wanna play Hide and Clap?

416
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,806
Fuck off!

417
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,531
That's, "No, thank you."

418
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,975
Let's do this.
Oh, lady's blindfold.

419
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,640
You got this out
your momma's room, right?

420
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,331
Oh, boy. Things me
and your momma do with this!

421
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,327
Sometimes she ties my hands and flip
me over and toss that... Salad.

422
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,482
Tony likes salad.
Anyway.

423
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,802
I'll put this on.
Let's do it!

424
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,131
One, two, three.
First clap!

425
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,484
Come on. Give me a clap.

426
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,841
Okay.

427
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,484
Yeah, I'm gettin' close.
I smell you. I smell you.

428
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,685
You smell like kids, like worms,
coins and doo-doo. Like...

429
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,330
Shit!

430
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,764
Can we just play Tag next time?
I just wanna play Tag.

431
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,969
Wyatt? Wyatt?

432
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,207
Where you at, you little shit?

433
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,362
Third clap.

434
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,201
A-ha!

435
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,680
I got you, Wyatt.

436
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,528
I win!
You took your blindfold off.

437
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,882
You're right, Tony.
Malcolm is an idiot.

438
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,202
Take your camera, loser.

439
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,200
Yeah, I wanna learn
how to start a fire.

440
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,728
What the hell was that?

441
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,406
I coulda swore...

442
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,891
Shit!

443
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,242
Fucked you up!

444
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,404
Fuck, are you crazy?
You know who the fuck I is?

445
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,403
Malcolm!
Baby?

446
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,815
Oh, my God!

447
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,015
You can't be jumpin' out
on brothers like that.

448
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,724
You'll get knocked
the fuck out every time.

449
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,571
It was supposed to be a joke!
You okay?

450
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,255
'Cause I fucked you up!

451
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,487
Like, I hit you with the force,
like with the follow-through.

452
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,331
I wanna instant replay
that shit. Damn!

453
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,403
'Cause you got froze.
You went...

454
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,048
"Please help me."

455
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,568
God, I hope this works.

456
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,124
What is that thing?

457
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,124
That is not human.

458
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,805
That was weird.

459
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,881
A-ha!

460
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,135
I caught your ass!

461
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,650
No, you didn't.

462
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,490
Oh, shit!

463
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,695
Becky...
It's your box.

464
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,006
What?

465
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,001
I want you to touch me.

466
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,846
Mmm.

467
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,362
Okay.

468
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,285
Not that box.

469
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,682
You know I love you and
those kids, right? Yeah.

470
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,015
And I'm gonna do everything in my
power to keep you guys protected.

471
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,326
Yeah.

472
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,088
What was that?
What?

473
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,564
That!
The wind?

474
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,281
Nigga, the windows
are closed! Okay?

475
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,562
I'm tellin' you, that was
either a ghost or a demon.

476
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,768
Or maybe it was a demon
pregnant with a ghost.

477
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,402
Oh, this is cute!

478
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,806
I will so wear this,
all day, every day.

479
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,335
What if it's a burglar?

480
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,931
Why the fuck are you excited?
It's a burglar!

481
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,055
Either way it goes,
it's some scary shit!

482
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,003
Okay,
not all burglars are scary.

483
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,566
It is a burglar or a ghost! If
you talk to him, he'll leave.

484
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,375
You shoot it in the face! If
you talk to him, he'll leave.

485
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,895
And if the motherfucker's foot do this,
you shoot him in the face again!

486
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,605
That is way too harsh.
What're you gonna do?

487
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,081
I know what I'm gonna do.
What're you gonna do?

488
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,401
Shoot him.

489
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,727
You are not allowed to shoot
anyone in the face, mister!

490
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,726
Becky?

491
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,125
What in the...
Becky! Oh, God!

492
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,165
Becky! Becky!

493
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,529
Megan!
Oh, my God!

494
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,365
Get me somethin',
Megan! Becky!

495
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,804
That shit's gross. That
fuckin' sound, it bothers me.

496
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,166
Gimme!

497
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,281
Oh!

498
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,211
That's all I got!
Okay, gimme!

499
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,490
Get that thing outta here!
I got an idea!

500
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,804
Come on! Bitch,
why ain't you movin'? Fuck!

501
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,645
See, now this is a good idea.

502
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,802
All right.
Goodnight, Becky.

503
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,880
Night, sweetheart.

504
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,775
Hey, buddy, what you doin'?

505
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,325
Havin' a tea party.
Oh.

506
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,135
You wanna go outside and do somethin'
a little bit more masculine?

507
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,926
Like play some football?
No, not really.

508
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,162
Hey, don't sit there!
That's Tony's seat!

509
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,050
Oh, sorry.

510
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,168
My bad, Tony.

511
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,009
Tony says, "No problem,
bee-yotch." Want some tea?

512
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,204
Uh... Yeah. Sure.

513
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,367
Um, you know, Wyatt,
about your little buddy, Tony.

514
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,209
I don't think he's such a good
influence on you, know what I mean?

515
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,810
What the... That's straight vodka!
Tony calls it tea.

516
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,407
He drinks a lot of tea.

517
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,280
I really think you guys
need to stop this friendship.

518
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,415
Tony doesn't think
that's such a good idea.

519
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,695
You know what, you tell Tony

520
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,725
that I said you and him ain't gonna
be friends no more, and that's final!

521
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,647
On second thought, you and Tony
have a beautiful friendship.

522
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,407
Okay, I'll be downstairs doin' somethin'
with less spooky shit.

523
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,084
This isn't good.
It's happening again.

524
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,882
It's really fuckin' happening.

525
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,324
What the fuck?

526
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,684
Who is it?

527
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,571
Hello?

528
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,967
That's a spooky knock.

529
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,364
Oh, you better run!

530
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,655
Knock on my door, come out there
and slap you...

531
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,364
What the fuck!

532
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,524
I got a knife!

533
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,285
What the...

534
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,089
"Miss me?" Abigail!

535
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,687
Oh, hell no!
Look, we gotta talk.

536
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,287
This is a mistake, okay? This shit
gotta stop. It's gone too far.

537
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,884
You see this? "Miss me?" In the house
with Megan, are you fuckin' crazy?

538
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,931
I take full responsibility,
all right? This is my bad.

539
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,811
I don't mean to sound clichéd.
It's not you, it's me.

540
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,775
Don't play fuckin'
innocent with me,

541
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,086
you knew I had a girl!

542
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,015
I'm just being
selfish right now.

543
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,455
I would love to have you
and Megan and...

544
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,455
To be honest with you,
my stuffed animals.

545
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,970
I'd like to bring them
in the mix.

546
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,735
I'm tryin' to make this work.

547
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,649
You're just not makin' it easy.

548
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,975
I swear to... Ah! Fuck!

549
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,085
You see what you made me do?
Only you do this to me!

550
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,165
Fuckin' crazy! Oh, you lucky my
momma told me don't hit bitches!

551
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,935
Fuckin' yeah, bitch.

552
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,011
True enough.

553
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,527
Fuck, you scare my... I didn't touch you!
I didn't touch you!

554
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,003
You get outta my life, I'll
get outta yours. I'm done.

555
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,682
Make no mistake.

556
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,730
After this, it's over.

557
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,360
You ready to go again? Yeah.

558
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,855
Hello, Malcolm?

559
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,015
Hey, hey, Professor Wilde,
how you doing?

560
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,565
Malcolm, I'm glad
you reached out.

561
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,080
What exactly
am I dealing with here?

562
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,815
Well, the being
you described to me

563
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,046
is a demon.

564
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,535
Fuck, I knew it!

565
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,135
A rare and obscure one

566
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,925
from Babylonian times
named Aghoul.

567
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,045
And he's a trickster!

568
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,204
And chances are this is not your
first encounter with this demon.

569
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,244
Have you had paranormal
experiences in your past?

570
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,402
Actually, yeah.
About a year ago.

571
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,843
This is way worse
than I had thought...

572
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,966
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck!

573
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,081
Ah!

574
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,241
Nigga, I thought somebody was shootin'!
Thai food!

575
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,404
It's spicy going in, but it's
twice as spicy going out!

576
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,375
That's scientifically
impossible!

577
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,449
I smell you in here!
What in the hell?

578
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,365
Ah, excuse me.

579
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,655
I hire based on skill level.

580
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,920
Are those titties?

581
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,255
Ladies, remember,

582
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,089
we're making meth,
not baby aspirin.

583
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,767
All the stories revolve around
Aghoul's attempts

584
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,764
to trick people into
bringing him into our world

585
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,375
and it can come through
the form of a possession,

586
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,255
a spirit that
only a child can see

587
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,365
or an ancient object that
lures in the impressionable.

588
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,215
So what you're saying is, something
is coming after me and my family.

589
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,605
Malcolm, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

590
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,962
Damn it, Jessica, you've got
your tit in the pseudoephedrine!

591
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,655
Sorry, Malcolm.
I wish you good luck.

592
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,170
Gotta get my Breaking Bad on.

593
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,965
Tonight you drown.

594
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,485
Not again.

595
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,169
Sink. Sink. Sink.

596
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,161
Ruined a perfectly good
leather jacket!

597
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,006
That's it.
Now we drown. Drown!

598
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,286
Drown!

599
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,002
Prepare to meet Hell.

600
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,644
Ow! God, that hurt!

601
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,161
Ow!
Oh!

602
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,006
My balls.
This isn't over!

603
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,375
Is Aghoul the same demon

604
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,606
that possessed Kisha?

605
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,842
When are the Republicans
gonna slip

606
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,321
and call Obama the N-word?

607
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,530
When are they gonna stop makin'
Scary Movies without the Wayans?

608
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,490
They fuckin' suck!

609
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,842
What the hell?

610
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,280
What the heck...

611
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,685
Steroids, bitch!

612
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,241
You messed with
the wrong nigga today!

613
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,643
Oh, my God!

614
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,321
Baby, put it down!
What are you doing?

615
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,081
I come in the hallway,
this fuckin' creepy box

616
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,242
with some weird
fuckin' lighting on it!

617
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,928
And I knew that it was death in the box!
Sol killed it!

618
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,535
Baby, it was a gift!

619
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,369
But it ain't Christmas.

620
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,241
Baby, no.
Kwanzaa?

621
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,295
You were so upset
when Shiloh Junior died

622
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,891
that the kids and I thought
we would get you...

623
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,735
Don't look. Don't look.

624
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,684
Oh, my God! Wyatt,
go upstairs. Go to your room!

625
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,895
I killed a baby.

626
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,575
Oh, God,
I think it's still breathing.

627
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,935
You're so fucking crazy.

628
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,121
He's still breathing.

629
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,055
I gotta take him
out of his misery.

630
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,605
- I gotta kill him!
- Oh, my God!

631
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,528
No! Malcolm!

632
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,644
Becky?

633
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,281
Yoo-hoo.

634
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,644
All right, let's see
what's in this box now.

635
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,847
Yeah.

636
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,568
Oh, God! Whoo!

637
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,935
Wow! That is rancid.

638
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,775
What the hell are you doing?
Nothing. Just, uh...

639
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,882
You know your pillows
have blue faces on 'em?

640
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,041
Stay away from my box!

641
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,924
Calm down!
Would you calm down?

642
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,520
I don't wanna calm down, I want
you to stay away from my box!

643
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,122
Do you have to say "box" so loud?
What is going on in here?

644
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,845
Nothing.
We just, uh, playin'.

645
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,803
Dolls 'n stuff.

646
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,401
Malcolm came into my room
and touched my box.

647
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,575
Malcolm, is this true?

648
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,728
Yes, but I only touched it
for like two seconds.

649
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,161
It was stinking!
Like, it was rancid!

650
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,055
Here, smell this. I don't know
how she play with that!

651
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,084
He had two fingers
in my tight little box, Mom.

652
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,055
- Stop lyin'.
- It is...

653
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,481
Baby, there's nothin'
tight about her box.

654
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,365
It's fuckin' huge! I could
put my whole fist in it.

655
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,689
Like, I almost was up to here for a second.
It's crazy big.

656
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,088
You said, "No means no!" And that is
exactly what I said. I said, "No!"

657
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,201
I did.
Whoa.

658
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,527
Time the fuck out. Hold up.

659
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,010
She's trying to
Dateline Special a nigga!

660
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,208
Where's Chris Hansen?
Chris! Chris!

661
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,203
Chris, come on, I know you
out here somewhere!

662
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,931
I know he's in here somewhere.
You tryin' to set a nigga up!

663
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,889
Can I talk to you for a second?
Right now.

664
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,055
There's something really strange

665
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,081
goin' on in this house.

666
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,362
Wyatt? Wyatt, see,
Wyatt used to be my boy.

667
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,371
Like that was my lil' nigga,
like we was like, boom, boom.

668
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,127
When my dog died,
that lil' nigga held me down!

669
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,886
But lately, he hasn't even talked to me!
Like, he won't even play with me!

670
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,535
His little imaginary friend,
Tony?

671
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,015
I don't think he's really...

672
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,724
You're crazy, Tony.
...imaginary.

673
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,015
Did you see that shit?

674
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,042
Look! You missed it!

675
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,846
Okay, look, forget him. Becky.

676
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,322
There's something in that old box she
carries around that's making her go crazy!

677
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,335
She sleeps with it,
she eats with it,

678
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,885
she even goes
to the bathroom with it!

679
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,721
Who takes a shit with a box in their hand?
It's fuckin' weird!

680
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,481
And by "weird" you mean
I'm a terrible mother.

681
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,775
What? No. Wait. Where did you go?
Hold on. Hold on a minute.

682
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,928
If you were just
a little bit less judgmental,

683
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,811
she wouldn't feel like she needs to
carry her pain around in a "box"!

684
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,089
This is not about me! It is
always about you, Malcolm!

685
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,575
"You're too fat,
you're a terrible parent,"

686
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,329
"you like black guys 'cause
they have bigger cocks!"

687
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,762
That sounds like you!
Do you see this?

688
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,323
That's not fuckin' normal! Okay, she
is just trying to get attention!

689
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,451
When she was a baby, she would cry and
cry and cry all damn day in her crib

690
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,764
until finally she realized I
wasn't gonna come and pick her up!

691
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,208
If you were a parent you'd know it's
called the "cry it out method," Malcolm!

692
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,442
Just pick the little bitch up!

693
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,128
She needs to learn to self-soothe.
See what I'm saying?

694
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,808
That is called parenting.
Wow! Mother of the year.

695
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,291
Thank you.

696
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,015
That crazy doll keyed my car!

697
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,295
Whoo! Bro,
somebody fucked your car up!

698
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,368
Yeah. You wouldn't know anybody
with an auto body shop, would you?

699
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,615
Are you serious, Bro?

700
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,610
Why, contrary to popular belief, all
Mexicans don't have body shops, man.

701
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,175
What, you think
we all have low riders

702
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,495
with a bunch
of primer all over it

703
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,575
with a frickin' Mexican horn?

704
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,855
You think I have like six kids

705
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,006
and all my relatives
livin' there, huh?

706
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,735
Probably chase Chihuahuas
and make burritos,

707
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,775
is that what you think?
Dude...

708
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,295
Look at the neighborhood, man!

709
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,401
I didn't think any of that!

710
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,970
I just want my
fuckin' car fixed!

711
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,447
I'm just fuckin' with you, Bro!

712
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,775
You're so easy, man.
Oh, shit.

713
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,455
Man, I got a cousin, his name is
Chucho, he can hook all that shit up.

714
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,055
Stop fuckin' with
the crazy bitches, man.

715
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,295
I gotta go, I got the family waiting.
All right? Be good, man!

716
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,482
Where did she go?

717
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,321
- Take it easy, vato!
- Where you goin'?

718
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,975
Goin' to the swap meet. We're
gonna get some Chihuahuas.

719
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,889
Wow.
Now that's racist!

720
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,975
So I moved into
the house across the street

721
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,161
and I just love it.

722
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,170
The streets are so quiet.
It's perfect for a haunting.

723
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,535
You know something,
I never got your name.

724
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,815
Kisha? What in the fuck!

725
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,844
You two know each other?
Oh. Well, yeah.

726
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,046
You know the boyfriend that I told you
abandoned me and left me in a ditch to die?

727
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,804
That's him.

728
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,364
Awkward!
Yeah!

729
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,205
I think I'll let you two
have at it.

730
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,364
And thank you so much, Megan,
for the coffee, really.

731
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,095
And, Malcolm,
it was great seeing you.

732
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,368
See you around, Malcolm.

733
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,881
Um...

734
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,529
Really?

735
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,407
How come you never
told me about her?

736
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,247
Well, it was just a time in my
life I just wanted to forget.

737
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,244
Okay, well you need to start remembering.
She was fucking beautiful!

738
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,404
She was aight.
"Aight"?

739
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,245
I mean, she got nice legs.
Legs.

740
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,928
Little ass, but...
Ass. How 'bout all this?

741
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,402
It's fuckable. Okay? But that's the...
It's all this...

742
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,087
She's crazy! She was crazy,
baby, like she was possessed!

743
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,244
You mean she was possessive.
No, the bitch was possessed.

744
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,055
What?
Yes!

745
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,764
First of all,
she was verbally abusive.

746
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,775
Hey, baby, what's for dinner?

747
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,371
Eat your
mother's pussy you fucking fuck!

748
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,735
Okay.

749
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,175
I don't know.
It was like she gave up.

750
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,575
Eventually I was able to
drag her to couples' therapy.

751
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,575
Well, Dr. Rousch,
me and my girlfriend,

752
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,895
we're kinda goin' through
a little rough patch.

753
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,763
I mean, she won't
communicate with me.

754
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,455
No matter what I do,
she just sits there.

755
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,288
Okay, and she'll growl a little bit.
Yes, I can hear that.

756
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,490
And the smallest things just set her off.
Like crucifixes, or questions.

757
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,563
Is that right, Kisha?

758
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,810
You got a prescription
for "crazy bitch"?

759
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,446
Malcolm, I'm so sorry.

760
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,123
It sounds horrible.
Well, it wasn't all bad.

761
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,535
Wait, I'm gonna come.
Shut up, you sound like a bitch!

762
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,971
Oh!

763
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,535
I think you just
knocked out a tooth!

764
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,960
Whose ass is this, huh?
Whose ass is this?

765
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,162
The Devil's!

766
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,322
See, now you just made it weird.

767
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,324
Look at me, God damn it!

768
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,004
Oh, my God, that was awesome!

769
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,642
Baby, you're makin'
my toes do this.

770
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,002
You're makin' my toes do this.

771
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,495
Really, Malcolm?

772
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,524
You know what they say
about the crazy ones.

773
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,411
What? Too soon?

774
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,815
There's something
goin' on with this box.

775
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,002
I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

776
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,685
What the heck
is this little pervert doing?

777
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,001
Ah!

778
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,040
Oh, dude, that is just weird!

779
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,285
Oh, really?

780
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,927
Oh, wow.

781
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,681
What kind of sweet
tooth fairy is this?

782
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,361
- This nigga need a daddy.
- "Dear Diary."

783
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,887
"I lost my virginity
to Joey today."

784
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,202
"Actually,
that's not totally true."

785
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,207
"I mean, I've only
had sex with 17 guys"

786
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,735
"but only in the butt,
so it doesn't count."

787
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,166
"I mean, I've sucked
a lot of dicks, Diary."

788
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,045
"I stopped counting after the
blowjob party at Ashley's house."

789
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,163
"There must've been
30 or 40 guys there."

790
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,529
She ain't got no bone in her neck.
She got that Plastic Man.

791
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,406
"PS: Diary, I'll never
stop sucking dicks. Ever!"

792
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,687
Wow.

793
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,535
Oh, would you look there?

794
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,722
A mood ring.
So, what mood is that?

795
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,684
It's called,
"You're not my father."

796
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,520
Oh, yeah, that's bitchy
lil' white teenager.

797
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,564
See, that'll get you slapped
in most black neighborhoods.

798
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,602
Are you okay?

799
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,649
Becky? Hey.

800
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,495
Ouch!

801
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,604
Ugh.

802
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,444
That is some serious meat-mouth
you got goin' on there.

803
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,288
It's easier going down than it
is coming up. Yeah, it's weird.

804
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,602
Breath smell like sirloin.

805
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,445
I hope that hole cold
ain't contagious.

806
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,095
Malcolm!

807
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,935
Professor,
it's kinda loud there. Um...

808
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,564
Did I catch you at a bad time?

809
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,569
Indica? I'm a sativa man.
I got important shit to do!

810
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,491
Hold on! I'm at a party.

811
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,444
I need some of my medicine.

812
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,889
Professor! How do I
get rid of the demon?

813
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,323
Professor! Professor!

814
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,130
Malcolm, that demon's
tryin' to get to you

815
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,322
through your family
and he's not gonna stop!

816
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,935
You've got the
paranormal equivalent of

817
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,041
a perfect storm, my friend!

818
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,810
Oh, Shit! The po-po!

819
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,605
Professor, please!
What's goin' on?

820
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,095
I got 12 ounces of crystal meth

821
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,455
jammed up my anus.
I gotta get outta here!

822
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,562
Police!
Oh, fuck!

823
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,768
Professor! Professor, please!

824
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,645
Hands up now!
I can't go back in!

825
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,525
Professor! How do I
get rid of the demon?

826
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,081
Oh, fuck.

827
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,650
You're under arrest!
You on the screen, freeze!

828
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,640
Hey, knothead!

829
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,361
Oh, no, not my favorite shirt.
That bitch.

830
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,170
What the...

831
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,209
Oh, my God!
Are you fucking kidding me?

832
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,601
No, no, no!
Not my clothes! No!

833
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,201
Phew.

834
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,175
Oh! Shit!

835
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,522
This crazy wooden bitch!
She's burning my clothes!

836
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,923
Oh, my God!
It's Fatal Attraction.

837
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,965
She's gonna boil a rabbit!
She's gonna boil a rabbit!

838
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,202
Can I get you something to drink?
Sure, man.

839
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,646
Tequila?
Really, Bro?

840
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,335
What, you bring
the Mexican into your house

841
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,727
and, "He must want tequila,
we should give him tequila."

842
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,566
"I'm glad he parked his burro so now I
can offer him some of his beverage."

843
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,255
I bet you this shit
has a worm in it, too, huh?

844
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,855
I should've walked in here with a serape
and a sombrero for you, too, huh?

845
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,495
That's what you wanted
really, wasn't it?

846
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,726
You get me all worked up, man!

847
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,724
Look, I could use a drink now.

848
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,855
What kind of tequila is it?
Is it silver?

849
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,041
'Cause I can't drink that
gold shit. That's for cholos.

850
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,722
Thank you, man. It's nice, man.
We're becomin' friends, right?

851
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,609
Uh, now we are.

852
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,335
I could trust you
with things, right?

853
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,640
I mean,
I can keep a secret, man.

854
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,895
I'm good at that shit.
The neighbors next door to me

855
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,570
don't even know there's
a black guy living here yet.

856
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,375
So, what do you wanna talk about?
Um...

857
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,295
Okay, you know the people that
lived in this house before me?

858
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,375
Mmm-hmm.

859
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,246
Was there anything strange goin' on,
like were they actin' weird or anything?

860
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,927
You saw something a little...

861
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,961
Spooky or supernatural?
I seen some shit.

862
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,055
Come on, man, you don't
believe in that, do you?

863
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,695
'Cause if you did, you know,
you'd have been like,

864
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,609
"Nigger, I'm out!
The deuces."

865
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,768
You mean to tell me you don't
believe in the paranormal?

866
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,924
Of course I believe in that shit!
I'm half Mexican, Bro!

867
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,328
I believe in all that shit
people don't believe in.

868
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,283
Freakin' La Llorona, El Cucuy,
Chupacabra, Bigfoot, Obamacare.

869
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,044
Interracial dating.
Nuclear war.

870
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,928
You name it, I'm all for it. Me personally,
I wouldn't stay one night in this house.

871
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,448
Shit! Look, I'm gonna be
honest with you, Bro.

872
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,803
When I first found out that there was a
black guy movin' in the neighborhood,

873
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,175
I was like,

874
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,804
"There goes
the property value."

875
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,964
"I'm gonna have to keep the kids
inside, there's gonna be gangs,"

876
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,124
"I'm gonna have to cover up graffiti,"
but you turned out to be okay.

877
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,405
You're really cool! You're very
accommodating. I think I can help you.

878
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,607
Really?

879
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,848
I need you to
cut the chicken's neck.

880
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,322
Oh, hell fuckin' no! You wanna
get rid of the demon or not?

881
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,480
I know, but can't we just go down to the
store and just like, buy a chicken?

882
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,604
No, man!
You need a blood sacrifice.

883
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,331
Right. Come here.
Let's do it.

884
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,642
Hold on! Hold up, wait a second!
Let me get my shit together.

885
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,481
You gonna shit in my
baby's cereal, chicken?

886
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,162
You wanna piss on my momma?
In her face?

887
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,895
I'll fuck...
Don't you...

888
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,727
Where did you get this chicken?
Your uncle's farm?

889
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,769
No! A cock fighting ring.

890
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,135
That's a dead motherfucker.

891
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,855
Whassup, chicken?
You scared? Whassup?

892
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,015
You don't want none of this,
motherfucker!

893
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,929
Oh, shit!

894
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,727
Bite him back, Malcolm!
Bite him back!

895
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,845
Drown, bitch!
I'm gonna kill you.

896
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,690
Watch what I do to your fuckin' baby!

897
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,211
What you doin', man?
What'd you do?

898
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,044
This polio is loco!

899
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,565
You got him,
Malcolm! That's right!

900
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,485
Yeah, you fucked that chicken.

901
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,535
Malcolm...

902
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,135
Yeah!

903
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,925
You about to go to
that great bucket in the sky!

904
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,162
Tell the Colonel I said hi!

905
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,975
Oh, shit!

906
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,575
That was like an intense-ass
game of Angry Birds, man!

907
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,490
Fuck, Bro, you did it!
I think this house is clean!

908
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,927
Well, maybe not clean,
but the demon's gone for sure.

909
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,924
What the hell are we gonna do
with all this chicken, Malcolm?

910
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,969
Oh, yeah, ask the black guy.

911
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,415
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm. Hey.

912
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,169
Cheers.
Right on!

913
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,167
What in the fuck?

914
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,804
You! This ends now!

915
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,806
You hear me, you googly-eyed
wooden bitch! Come on!

916
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,851
You're making me
bury your fuckin' ass!

917
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,085
Get in there!

918
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,646
Die, you stink bitch!

919
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,804
B-I-T...

920
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,962
Fuckin' bitch!

921
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,290
You want some of this?

922
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,804
All right,
prepare to meet your maker!

923
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,164
That's right, I'm sending
you back to Taiwan!

924
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,642
You smell like piss and shit!

925
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,161
Come on! You make me sick!

926
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,162
You know what brown
can do for me? Take this!

927
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,847
You sign!
Get the fuck outta here!

928
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,160
Oh, see, I tried to do it
the easy way.

929
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,682
Now you're gonna
make me violent.

930
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,889
Come on, you... Get the fuck over here!
Shut up!

931
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,887
How you like that, bitch?
I want you to watch.

932
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,725
Let's see you write it now!

933
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,722
Miss me? This is fun.

934
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,850
Oh, we about to have a barbecue.
Get in there.

935
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,520
Yeah! Hey, how you doin'?

936
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,160
You gonna fuckin'
burn today, baby!

937
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,050
That's what fucking
hell feels like!

938
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,446
You fuckin'... Fucking die!

939
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,083
I will watch your life come out of you.
Just die, you little...

940
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,375
I'll fuckin' cut your
goddamn eye out, you bitch!

941
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,164
Malcolm!

942
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,089
Malcolm! What did you do to our room?
Say fucking nothing.

943
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,215
Honey, it's not what it
looks like, okay? Really?

944
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,855
It's not what it looks like.
Really?

945
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,044
Listen, listen to me. She's crazy!
It's not me, she's crazy!

946
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,775
You're crazy.
No, honey! Megan!

947
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,290
You're crazy.
It's not what it looks like!

948
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,575
Get away from me.
I'm not done with you,

949
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,443
you fuckin' home-wrecker!

950
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,405
God!

951
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,250
See, nobody will listen to the
black guy till everybody dead!

952
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,455
I see how you lookin' at me.
Let me tell you something.

953
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,006
This house...
This house is haunted.

954
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,521
You know that little doll that
you like so much? Abigail?

955
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,486
Yeah, well, let me tell you something
about Abigail. She's alive!

956
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,642
That's right, she's alive!

957
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,522
Not like "alive" alive, but
alive as in "is possessed."

958
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,242
You know how I know? 'Cause it made
me have sex with it! Repeatedly!

959
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,086
Upstairs, downstairs,
in the kitchen, in the yard!

960
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,015
While you were sleepin'
next to us!

961
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,644
Right there
where you're sitting, twice!

962
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,440
And that's why, when you came
upstairs and you caught me

963
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,215
and I was killing the doll,
because I was just like,

964
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,640
"You're fuckin' up
my relationship!"

965
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,287
And that box? It's cursed!

966
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,922
That box and that box.
That's haunted with a demon.

967
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,287
That box, cursed with dudes. But
that's a whole other story.

968
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,569
And your son, his little imaginary
friend that teaches him curse words

969
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,922
and gets him crunk off vodka!

970
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,327
Yeah, yeah, I'm blowing
your spot, little man.

971
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,450
Well, he's not so imaginary!
He's cray!

972
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,935
No, no, no.
You cray! You cray-cray!

973
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,328
You and your whole lot of other ethnic
words that's going out of style.

974
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,563
You ain't funky fresh or dope.
So, how about that, cray-cray?

975
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,122
Mom, he's scaring me.

976
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,443
Is this the nigga
whose room exploded?

977
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,008
I'm scaring you!
Opie, you something else!

978
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,484
You know what, that's it. I've had enough
of this whole haunted house craziness!

979
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,135
It's bad enough
that you think it's real,

980
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,815
but now you're scaring the kids!

981
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,295
I'm scaring the kids!
Yes!

982
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,244
Ain't that the pot
callin' the kettle a nigga!

983
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,724
No, no, no, baby! Your kids are scaring me!
Okay?

984
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,215
Look at this one! She's
Marilyn Manson in the skin

985
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,323
and Charlie Manson in the eyes!
Her eyes look crazy, okay?

986
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,975
That's a crazy woman
carrying around a box

987
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,375
like fuckin' Lionel
from the Peanuts,

988
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,084
and he's hangin' out
with dead niggas

989
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,289
and I'm crazy? Oh! So, what am I
supposed to do with all this?

990
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,011
Maybe you weren't ready!
Maybe we moved in too soon.

991
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,175
Maybe you're not
ready for a family!

992
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,135
But we come as
a package deal, okay?

993
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,295
This ain't about you
or them, okay? You...

994
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,370
Oh, shit. No! Hey!
Don't touch that shit!

995
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,855
Don't touch it!
That's a demon ring.

996
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,855
Don't you answer that, you hear?

997
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,495
That's the devil
callin' right there.

998
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,000
That is an evil ring!
You hear that?

999
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,123
Yeah, I said it, a demon ring!

1000
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,084
And you can insta-tweet
that on your gram-o-vine!

1001
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,208
Nobody touch it!

1002
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,415
Stop ringing!

1003
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,203
Stop ringing! Stop!

1004
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,295
Oh, that's a demon callin'.

1005
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,209
Uh, Malcolm?
Your pocket.

1006
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,768
Huh. Oh.

1007
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,407
We gotta change my ringer.

1008
00:52:55,560 --> 00:53:00,202
Why do we even have home phones anymore?
I mean...

1009
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,927
Yeah? Who is it?

1010
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,931
What the hell? Hey, how you
doin', officer? Come on in.

1011
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,927
We got a call about
a domestic dispute.

1012
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,246
Are you Malcolm Johnson?

1013
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,655
Uh, yeah, that's me,
but there's no dispute.

1014
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,055
I mean, I threw the phone,
but...

1015
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,095
You're under arrest.
Hey! For what?

1016
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,691
Oh, my God! Just raised
my voice a little bit!

1017
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,082
Malcolm, our phone is broken.
I know what...

1018
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,289
It's the doll! It's the doll! It
was the doll, brother, listen!

1019
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,735
This is all a misunderstanding.

1020
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,921
It was this doll. I was
fuckin' this doll, right?

1021
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,255
He's on PCP. Let's take him.
No, I'm not on PCP!

1022
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,615
You fuckin' bitch!

1023
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,775
You fuckin' bitch!

1024
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,131
You fuckin' bitch!

1025
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,203
Malcolm, maybe
this is for the best.

1026
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,410
Can't escape my wrath,
for I am death.

1027
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,486
Now you burn. Fire.

1028
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,441
Help!

1029
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,682
What is...

1030
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,523
Malcolm?

1031
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,055
Malcolm?
Mmm...

1032
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,362
Damn, son, you look fucked up!

1033
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,055
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me!

1034
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,607
Mom, your man's in here pukin'
like a little bitch!

1035
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,015
See that shit, Tony?

1036
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,848
Sometimes the victim may be
tormented by more than one demon.

1037
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,123
These cases lead
to transference.

1038
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,215
Trans-who?
What the fuck is that, dog?

1039
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,615
Father Williams!
Mind your tongue.

1040
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,926
You are a man of the cloth!

1041
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,335
Damn, man, ain't like I'm
rapin' motherfuckers no more,

1042
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,600
you know what I'm sayin'?

1043
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,451
Shit. Keep on wit' your
little lesson, brother.

1044
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,170
Victims have also
been known to break

1045
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,850
their own bones
during the possession.

1046
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,765
True.
That happened to me.

1047
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,566
I was first in prison, I was
tryin' to give myself head, right?

1048
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,290
'Cause I ain't know nobody.

1049
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,895
If I woulda knew somebody, I wouldn't
have had to do it to myself.

1050
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,446
And it wasn't no gay shit.
First get that out your head.

1051
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,887
That's enough! I've had
enough of your insolence!

1052
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,607
My what?
My insolence?

1053
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,604
Dog, you going to bring up
my condition right now?

1054
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,935
You gonna bring up
my diabetes, dog?

1055
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,450
Talkin' about my insolence.

1056
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,763
'Cause I like cake?
Yeah, I like cake, guys.

1057
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,127
I like cake, birthday cake,
all kinds of cake.

1058
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,447
I'm talking about,
cake, cake, cake!

1059
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,295
Man, you know what?

1060
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,375
I'm sick of your shit!

1061
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,285
Get outta here! Everybody break out.
Take your boy with you.

1062
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,125
Yeah. I mean really, man.

1063
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,041
Ooh.

1064
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,487
Malcolm?

1065
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,295
Hey, Father Williams!

1066
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,975
Fuck, nigga, what'd I tell you
about callin' me that?

1067
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,495
I'm sorry. Hey, Doug!

1068
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,010
Roll down, man!

1069
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,775
I'm sorry you caught that, man.
I'm so stressed out, man.

1070
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,928
I had to shank a muthafucka.
You saw that, right?

1071
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,415
I didn't see nothin'.

1072
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,727
That's a good answer.
That's a good answer.

1073
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,335
If you saw it...
'Cause I was gonna say

1074
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,975
if you woulda said yes,
I woulda...

1075
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,935
Oh, shit!

1076
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,167
That's all right, I don't have nothin'.
That's the only one I had.

1077
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,495
I used to have two shanks, but
I don't keep that anymore.

1078
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,806
I stopped doin' two shanks

1079
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,335
'cause it just was a thang, and

1080
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,691
everybody was like,
"Two shanks."

1081
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,440
Yeah, so, how you doin'?

1082
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,649
I, uh... I need your help.

1083
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,529
It's happenin', Doug.

1084
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,324
Hell no!

1085
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,535
You know I'm not
comin' over there

1086
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,535
and fuckin' with you and your
creepy lil' bitch again!

1087
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,895
I ain't even with
that bitch no more!

1088
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,575
I'm beggin' you, man,
I just need your help.

1089
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,015
I just don't know
who else to go to.

1090
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,202
Let me just explain to you
why I became a priest.

1091
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,330
Now, obvious one is
for the little boys. Yes.

1092
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,295
What're you talkin' about?

1093
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,415
It's a joke, Malcolm!

1094
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,575
Oh, God, no, it was a joke.
I did that, you know,

1095
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,602
for the other priests
and we laugh, that's all.

1096
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,765
But I don't know if I can help
you with your demon situation

1097
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,535
because I haven't
been stayin' steady

1098
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,404
on my demon fightin' skills, is
what I'm tryin' to tell you.

1099
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,803
So Malcolm, day after day,

1100
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:07,528
when you know you can't win, you're
just prolonging the inevitable!

1101
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,535
All you gotta do is let them in.

1102
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,005
Are you talkin' about the Devil?

1103
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,771
Worse. The Kardashians.

1104
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,086
Yeah.

1105
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,815
Yeah, did you see 'em?
It's the crazy mama,

1106
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,888
it's Kim, Khloe, Kourtney,
crazy, the two little ones...

1107
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,362
They gonna be freaks. They
got Lamar, they got Scott...

1108
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,015
Rob, fat as a motherfucker,

1109
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,610
Bruce with the acne.
Oh, Bruce...

1110
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,055
What the fuck is wrong
with Bruce Jenner face?

1111
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,411
He look like a monster!

1112
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,643
He scares me at night!
And he on in daytime.

1113
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,935
He don't look like the nigga
that was on the Wheaties box!

1114
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,884
And Kanye! And Kanye!
And Julianne Hough!

1115
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:44,255
I love it and I hate it. They
took Kanye and they changed him.

1116
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,455
Doug, you know... Doug...

1117
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,811
You have to let go of me, Doug.

1118
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,375
You can't...

1119
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,765
Doug, you gotta let go of me!

1120
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,646
There's no place you can hide.
He has a plan for you.

1121
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,490
Doug, get off of me.
He will get you!

1122
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,455
Doug, get your hands off me!

1123
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,815
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1124
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,601
Ow!

1125
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,684
Oh, you're the one that got
us out here in the hot heat!

1126
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,605
Making me bang all on the windows
with my good church hat!

1127
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,415
Hon, I could be at home
watchin' that new Madea movie!

1128
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,535
What's the name
of that Madea movie

1129
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,375
with the little girl
from The Fresh Prince?

1130
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,415
You know the one, she played the
head of NASA! With the aliens!

1131
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,495
Madea Goes To Mars!

1132
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,284
Boom!
Madea Goes To Mars, that's it!

1133
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,615
Hold up, ain't you that brother

1134
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,291
that just moved
into old Burton place?

1135
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,201
Yeah, it's just...
With a white woman!

1136
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,975
Well, she's not
all the way white.

1137
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,571
She's a white woman,
damn near clear!

1138
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,004
Come on now, it's 2013. Interracial
relationships is not a big deal.

1139
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,335
What? You need to
tell that to the lonely sista.

1140
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,055
Look at this one right here.
Right here!

1141
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,615
Honey, show him how you
drop it like it's hot!

1142
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,849
Whoo! Hold up, Bertha, hold up. Hold up.
We ain't got no defibrillator.

1143
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,695
Oh, you know what it is
with the white girl?

1144
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,485
They do that cungalingus,
the finga-ligga-linga.

1145
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,975
- What is it, the fellatio?
- Uh...

1146
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,615
That's what it is, they go deep.

1147
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,001
You know they
ain't got no insides.

1148
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,690
I think that's my cue to go.

1149
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,610
Excuse me, sistas.
Have a good sermon.

1150
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,255
Where you goin'?

1151
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,655
Love is love.
You're so bitter.

1152
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,886
- See?
- You angry.

1153
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,721
Brothers be trippin'. That's why
I got me a white man at home.

1154
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,808
- Yeah, girl.
- Vanilla my flavor.

1155
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,135
Hello, Malcolm.

1156
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,455
Oh, Professor Wilde, thank God.

1157
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,005
I've been tryin' to reach you!

1158
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,969
I'm sorry, Malcolm,
I've been a bit tied up.

1159
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,975
I haven't been able to find
any more on Aghoul,

1160
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,048
though my resources
are a bit limited.

1161
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,646
Uh, Professor?
Where the hell are you?

1162
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,121
Ooh, doin' a stretch
of five to 10.

1163
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,655
Apparently, the authorities
frown on sellin' meth

1164
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,648
to college students.

1165
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,251
Yeah, apparently.

1166
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,535
You need to hang up

1167
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,655
that computer call,

1168
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,081
come over here and kiss me
on my hot mouth.

1169
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,807
I'm feelin' romantical.

1170
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,055
Well, Malcolm,
I suppose I should get going.

1171
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,809
But I will be
e-mailing you the contacts

1172
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,055
of associates
who'll be able to help.

1173
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,695
I don't mean to be pushy,
but any way

1174
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,290
you could do that
before you get raped?

1175
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,575
What part of mandingo party

1176
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,728
do you not understand?

1177
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,167
It's time to power
the white rabbit.

1178
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,126
You know. Dirty the snow.

1179
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:10,961
Oh, I'm screwed.

1180
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,560
Don't!
That's not that bad.

1181
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,601
Lights, please. Thank you.

1182
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,725
So after several exhausting
days of the exorcism,

1183
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,043
I threw some holy water on
her, read an incantation

1184
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,735
and the demon left
the woman's body.

1185
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,128
I suppose I just
sat back and watched.

1186
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,535
I mean, I'm just the medium
who puts her life in danger

1187
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,086
every time she reaches out
to demonic forces.

1188
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,855
But you've got a Bible
and a bottle of holy water,

1189
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,135
so you make
the world a safer place!

1190
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,535
The fact is, people,
is that God is real,

1191
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:46,803
the Devil is real,
and monsters exist.

1192
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,970
Well... They're vicious,
terrifying entities!

1193
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,771
But the good news is,
Santa Claus doesn't exist

1194
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,495
so you don't have to worry
about some creepy old guy

1195
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,975
coming down your chimney.

1196
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,095
Okay...
Got your nose!

1197
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,805
So, what exactly are you guys?
And who the fuck hired you?

1198
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,327
You can call us Ned and Noreen.

1199
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,086
See? This is why you don't
hire from Craigslist.

1200
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,566
Asshole!

1201
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,575
I don't understand why you
always have to take the credit!

1202
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,055
I mean, even your name comes
first on our book cover,

1203
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,735
and I am the one with a gift!
It's not my fault

1204
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,240
that Ned comes before
Noreen in alphabetical order!

1205
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,967
Is that why Ned comes before
Noreen in the bedroom?

1206
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,895
Just once I'd like
you to do that thing

1207
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,135
with your thumb
and your forefinger.

1208
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,575
I think they
call it the shocker?

1209
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,400
Yeah, well, I would like you to do
that thing with my balls and the...

1210
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,642
Hi! Hi! can we help you?

1211
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,690
Yes. Um, there's something
horrible happening in my house.

1212
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,127
My family doesn't realize
what's going on, but I do!

1213
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,615
I'm sure that there's
a rational explanation...

1214
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,775
Please! They're white!

1215
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,975
Oh, my God!
Why didn't you say that?

1216
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,286
Yeah, you should lead with that!

1217
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,962
I mean, if you're black we just
assume that your hauntings are

1218
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,845
bill collectors or
racist police officers.

1219
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,843
But 99% of all hauntings

1220
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,809
happen to white people,
that's a fact.

1221
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,651
What he means to say is,
of course we'll help you.

1222
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,040
Thank you so much.

1223
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,175
So we're here to
help you people.

1224
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,646
And before you get worked up, I
mean "you people" as a couple.

1225
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,495
It wasn't racist
till you explained it.

1226
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,681
Yeah.

1227
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,215
The bad news is you have
a demon in your house.

1228
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,295
Here we go again.

1229
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,688
Okay, wait. So the house
really is haunted?

1230
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,162
Megan, it's not
the house that's haunted.

1231
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,164
A-ha! I knew it! I knew it! It's
always the little white girl.

1232
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,175
Think about it. The Exorcist,
The Last Exorcism,

1233
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,375
The Exorcism of Emily Rose.
All white girls.

1234
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,695
'Cause there ain't no black
parents gonna have

1235
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,015
no little white girl
talkin' like that.

1236
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,495
"Bitch, who are you?"
Who're you cursin' at?

1237
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,175
"And turn
the fuckin' air down in here!"

1238
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,655
Malcolm, Malcolm, just
listen for a second. Yes.

1239
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,366
When we first met you, there
was something attached to you.

1240
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,041
Oh, that was a hemorrhoid.
That was... It's good now.

1241
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,726
This dark entity has
attached itself to him

1242
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,922
and now it's
feeding off of all of you.

1243
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,935
So what you're saying is that
this is all Malcolm's fault.

1244
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,015
That's right. Your family
could've left here at

1245
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,963
any time, but now you're stuck.

1246
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,015
Like a piece of toilet paper

1247
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,881
stuck on your shoe
when you leave the bathroom.

1248
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,048
And your wife knew the whole
time, but she didn't tell you

1249
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,044
because she wanted you to walk
around and look like an idiot.

1250
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,575
Oh, get over it! I'm not
the one who had an affair

1251
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,841
with some low-rent
palm reader from Akron!

1252
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,120
And you never would've known
if you weren't a psychic!

1253
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,935
But I am psychic, Ned!

1254
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,166
Oh!
Ow.

1255
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,248
Shit!
What is that for?

1256
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,562
What you'll be thinking about
doing to Megan in two seconds.

1257
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,001
"Thinking about doing to
Megan?" One, two, see?

1258
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,728
Uh, guys,
we came on short notice.

1259
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,444
We may need
an extra pair of hands.

1260
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,410
Anyone you trust to help?

1261
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,568
I know a guy. He's Mexican.

1262
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,649
Megan,
let's go to your contacts.

1263
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,695
Hey, nice camera.
Right?

1264
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,927
I take it your third cousin
owns electronics shops.

1265
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,415
Eh, somethin' like that. He sells
them out of the back of his truck.

1266
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,920
It's a mobile operation.
Let me know if you want one.

1267
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,095
Hey, Ned, something weird.

1268
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,283
All these clocks stop at 3:27
when the hauntings happen.

1269
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,525
Normally, it's 3:07.
Nope, we're on CP time.

1270
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,931
The demon will manifest itself
in many ways.

1271
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,135
To your son,
it's his imaginary friend.

1272
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,322
To your daughter
it's the voice inside the box.

1273
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,761
For Malcolm it's that
sexy little doll Abigail.

1274
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,123
See? It's a manifestation! You think
I'd bang a doll for no reason?

1275
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,408
Malcolm! Shut up.
What we're about to do

1276
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,331
is the first step in banishing
the demon to the netherworld.

1277
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,450
Oh, what is that?

1278
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:21,291
This helps me communicate
with the demon.

1279
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,735
Organic,
hydroponically grown OG Kush.

1280
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,000
Very strong.

1281
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,484
This is some good shit.

1282
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,529
Well, pass the mask, shit.

1283
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,444
We grow it ourselves.

1284
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,404
High water bill.

1285
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,170
That's that shit right there!

1286
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,240
Let me get another hit.
I'm goin' to the Further.

1287
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,241
Tony, where are you?

1288
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,365
Smells like that OG Kush.

1289
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,361
Mom!

1290
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,688
What...
Becky!

1291
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,695
Cool!
Wyatt, get upstairs!

1292
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,760
- Wyatt, come on!
- Fuck you, you bitch!

1293
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,290
Why are you tying
my baby to a chair?

1294
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,925
Because the bitch
got a demon in her!

1295
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,731
Make it stop!

1296
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,804
This is some scary
Cucuy shit right here, man.

1297
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,535
I don't know who Cucuy is.

1298
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,403
A Cucuy is a
ghetto Mexican bogeyman.

1299
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,215
Oh, like George Lopez.

1300
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,401
I know, huh?

1301
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,291
I agree, it is scary as fuck.

1302
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,727
This spirit is
more powerful than I thought.

1303
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,571
We're gonna need to get a priest
and perform a real exorcism.

1304
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,923
I know a guy!
He's a little unconventional.

1305
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,524
I don't know, Malcolm.

1306
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,409
I know, that bitch
don't look right.

1307
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,055
No, why you gotta
call her a bitch?

1308
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,525
You disrespecting the little ho.

1309
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,330
Nigga, did you just sell me out?

1310
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,442
There's certain words
that trigger white folk.

1311
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,775
I mean, bitch, ho, slut.
No offense.

1312
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,775
You can't say those words.
That's like our...

1313
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,801
Hey!

1314
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,921
What the hell are
you talking about?

1315
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,161
Are you out your damn mind?

1316
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,535
We would never say that.

1317
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,688
Oh, we would
behind closed doors.

1318
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,175
I mean, I wouldn't say it
in a bus or a waffle house.

1319
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,326
At the Atlanta Airport

1320
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,324
or in the parking lot of a KFC,
but, yeah, I would say it.

1321
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,323
Hey, I ain't your boy...
I got your back.

1322
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,135
This is a lovely
scarf you're wearing.

1323
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,810
It's a sash,
you know what I'm sayin'?

1324
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,531
I'm selling these. This a
part of my new clothing line,

1325
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,255
"Jesus Pieces," and I got, like,

1326
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,805
the shoe that
the Pope be wearin'.

1327
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,646
In leather, suede, in green,
brown, and the Pope hats!

1328
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,804
I can't keep that shit, you
know niggers love big hats.

1329
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,080
Okay, you know what, that's enough.
Thank you so much.

1330
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,489
That's right. Can we help
my daughter, please?

1331
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,655
Hell, she went
really white girl on me.

1332
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,489
"Oh, my God!"
I was like, "Whoa."

1333
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,484
Speaking of white...
Are you doin' cocaine again?

1334
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,563
Cocaine?
No, man, this stuff's molly!

1335
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,411
Oh!
Can I try?

1336
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,005
- It's all good.
- Oh, wow.

1337
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,411
I'm gonna take
a little pinch for later.

1338
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,010
He's just bringing drugs?

1339
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,695
It's molly.
Wrap it up!

1340
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,680
Yeah, I'm sorry. I told you
he was unconventional.

1341
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,095
All right.

1342
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,855
Hey, chill. Calm down, man.

1343
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,484
Doug! Doug! Doug! Whoa.

1344
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,255
Y'all some crazy
ass motherfuckers.

1345
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,960
Y'all thought I was
gonna shoot this bitch?

1346
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,606
I'm just gonna pistol-whip her
until she weakens.

1347
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,815
You're not pistol-whipping
my daughter!

1348
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,135
I am not pistol-whipping
my daughter.

1349
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,535
He know's what he's doing.
The man is a genius.

1350
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,970
In the name of the Father and
the Holy Ghost...

1351
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,889
I need three other white people.

1352
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,371
Peyton Manning!

1353
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,806
Peyton Manning, Kristen Stewart.

1354
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,371
Paula Deen!

1355
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:33,335
Where's Doug? I can't find
his black ass in this dark!

1356
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,415
Where the hell is he?

1357
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,495
Look for eyes!

1358
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,683
Like a forest creature in a cartoon.
Father Doug!

1359
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,531
He's over here! He's over here!

1360
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,484
Doug! Nigga, please, don't.

1361
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,682
Father, please don't!

1362
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,335
No, wait! It's better if he points
the gun at himself and not at us.

1363
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,935
Just talk to him, Malcolm.

1364
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,281
Listen to my voice, okay, Doug?
Listen to my voice.

1365
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,411
This is not what niggas do!
We don't do suicide!

1366
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:58,882
Murder, yes! Suicide?
That's what they do.

1367
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,567
Yeah, we do that.
I've tried at least 20 times.

1368
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,927
Motherfucker got me acting
all crazy, actin' the fool!

1369
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,088
You know damn well I wouldn't
peel my own cap!

1370
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,565
I can't stop it! I can't
stop it! Man, it keeps...

1371
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,055
There's somethin' in my head that's
tellin' me to blow off my head.

1372
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,003
Is it in here? Is it in there?

1373
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:20,562
No, no, no! Yeah, up there!

1374
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,175
Demon break.
Who wants a mojito?

1375
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,884
Oh, the black guy's
still got a gun.

1376
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,970
Oh, God! This demon is
a son of a bitch, man!

1377
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,771
Father,
why have you abandoned me?

1378
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:34,527
Is it because I cuss a lot,
even during prayer?

1379
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,762
"Amen, motherfucker,"
sounds dope.

1380
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,082
Is it because...

1381
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,046
I don't get Ryan Seacrest.
I don't get him.

1382
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:45,449
I know what it is, 'cause I
dressed up as a foreclosure sign

1383
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,921
when people was getting
kicked out of their house.

1384
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,248
On Halloween I just
stood in the yard.

1385
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,442
I knew it was wrong,
but it was funny to me.

1386
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,001
Out of all of
the people on the Brady Bunch,

1387
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,487
it was Alice that
I wanted to fuck.

1388
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,455
In the station wagon, on top of Mr.
Brady's architect desk.

1389
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,562
Just used it for
protractors and rulers.

1390
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,286
Is it because I
actually kinda thought

1391
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,971
that it was okay that
Chris Brown hit Rihanna?

1392
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,691
I know that bitch hit him first, man!
She talk too much shit!

1393
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,975
She an Island Girl.
"What you doin', Chris?"

1394
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,015
"Where you goin'?" Who's this
bitch talkin' "about Chris?"

1395
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,485
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

1396
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:18,855
Somebody help me.

1397
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,080
Doug! Fight it, Doug!

1398
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,647
No! Nigga, that's a bigass gun!
That's gonna hurt, nigga.

1399
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,531
Malcolm,
he has a message for you.

1400
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,529
He says...

1401
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,880
"Hi, bitch."

1402
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,250
Oh, my God!
No!

1403
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,167
We're gonna need another priest!
It's too late.

1404
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,720
I have to perform the exorcism.

1405
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:41,841
It's true.

1406
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,975
Although Ned's only
formal training was at

1407
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,843
Ghostbusters summer
camp back in 1988.

1408
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,575
Never cross the streams.
Never cross them.

1409
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,681
And he is dumb!

1410
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,161
I mean, dumb, dumb, dumb!

1411
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,006
The point is, you can do this!

1412
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,935
Do you remember what you said
to me on our wedding night?

1413
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,015
"I have whiskey dick and I'll make
it up to you in the morning."

1414
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:01,522
No! You said God brought
us together for a reason.

1415
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,601
That doesn't sound like me.
Must've been really drunk.

1416
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:07,564
Just fucking do it, dummy!
Okay.

1417
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,335
Becky!
Did it work?

1418
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,575
Please help me.
I'm sorry for everything!

1419
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,045
I think you did it!

1420
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,207
Full inversion.
We got a full inversion.

1421
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,009
Oh, fuck!

1422
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,884
Oh, my God!

1423
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,566
Time to die!

1424
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,846
It was him! It was him!

1425
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,200
No, don't do me like that!

1426
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,050
It actually was him.

1427
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,095
Better him than me.

1428
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,009
That looked like it hurt, shit.

1429
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,695
Whoo! Now, that's what
you call a blowjob.

1430
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,767
A leaf blower?

1431
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,684
- Don't judge me.
- Malcolm!

1432
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,322
Demon, you leave
our daughter alone!

1433
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,445
That's not your
daughter anymore!

1434
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,161
I didn't mean like
a daughter-daughter...

1435
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,535
I was just saying that... Seriously?
Malcolm, help her!

1436
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,891
Okay. God damn it!

1437
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,286
Go get 'em, buddy.

1438
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,135
Wyatt, are you okay?

1439
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,605
Yeah, but Becky?

1440
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,762
She looks pretty fucked up.

1441
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,055
Demon, I'll make you a deal.

1442
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,811
How about you leave, and we'll
pretend none of this ever happened?

1443
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,769
The bitch is mine!

1444
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,729
You heard the man,
the bitch is his. I tried.

1445
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,935
Seriously?

1446
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,735
She said the bitch is his.
That's pretty emphatic.

1447
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,445
Malcolm, please help me.
I'm so sorry.

1448
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:41,646
Becky will rot in hell!

1449
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,610
Okay, which one is it? Go rot in
hell or you want me to help you?

1450
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,935
Malcolm, help her!

1451
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,041
The bitch is confusing me!

1452
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:52,001
Okay. Demon, you leave her alone!
You take me instead!

1453
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,601
Deal.

1454
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,087
Wait, no, no, no.
Here, take him instead!

1455
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,575
I haven't heard
a demon scream for a while.

1456
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,080
I think it's safe
to go back up there.

1457
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,535
I still have a bad feeling.

1458
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,244
For God's sake, come on, guys!

1459
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,881
Come on!
All right.

1460
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,841
Oh, my God! Wyatt,
get upstairs right now!

1461
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,082
They're cuddling!
The demon's gone!

1462
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:20,164
I did it! This house is clean!

1463
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,324
Look at his eyes! They're rolling
to the back of his head!

1464
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,695
I think he's possessed.

1465
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,760
That's the face that he makes
when he has an orgasm.

1466
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,495
I think he's okay, you guys.

1467
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,124
This is not over.

1468
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,691
Are you guys watching this?

1469
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,815
Yes, we're watching it, dummy!

1470
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,763
I'm so intrigued by this.

1471
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:40,005
Oh, man! He's all twisted
up like a chocolate pretzel!

1472
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,655
Such flexibility
and the dexterity!

1473
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,081
Oh, my God. This is
making me queasy!

1474
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,083
It's like he could
suck his own dick.

1475
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,009
I don't wanna suck my...
Please help me!

1476
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,848
If I could do that, I don't think
I'd ever talk to you again.

1477
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,535
Stop it, you unholy demon!

1478
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,201
Oh! Oh! That is greasy shit!
Probably Murray's.

1479
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,400
The power of Christ compels you!

1480
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,047
It burn like bum piss!

1481
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,695
That means it's working!

1482
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,370
Pour the whole thing, like
I just won the Super Bowl!

1483
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,655
Go!
Oh, my God.

1484
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:09,975
Are you crazy?

1485
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,126
Is that all you got, bitch?

1486
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,495
Oh!

1487
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,247
Wait, guys!
Stop! Everybody, stop!

1488
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,004
Malcolm, are you okay?

1489
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,724
No, I think I'm gonna be sick.

1490
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,245
What?
Hold up.

1491
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,085
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1492
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,882
Oh, my God, I can't...

1493
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,241
Oh.

1494
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,569
Puking like a runway model.

1495
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,047
- I'm good. I'm good.
- Are you done?

1496
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,335
You're gonna want to
Febreze all of this.

1497
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,408
You're gonna
wanna just clean this.

1498
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,855
I feel so much better now.

1499
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,961
Whoo!

1500
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,241
Oh!

1501
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,215
Can't be too sure. Oh, shit.

1502
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,520
I gotta get the hell outta here.

1503
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,775
Once they see a black
guy in a pool of blood,

1504
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,086
you know who they're
gonna come after next.

1505
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,288
I gotta go. Hey, watch out!

1506
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,055
Now this place is clean.

1507
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,360
It sounded
better when I said it.

1508
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,375
Get the box.

1509
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,735
Thank you guys so much.

1510
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,361
No need to thank us.
We're happy to help.

1511
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,930
Come on, Ned.

1512
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,735
And we'll just take Abigail with
us as well, for safekeeping.

1513
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,495
Yeah, I know what you plan
on doing with that doll.

1514
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,295
What? No, I'm a professional.
She's a freak bitch.

1515
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,615
Stop it.
Trust me.

1516
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,120
Hey. How come Noreen ain't
pickin' up on the vibes?

1517
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,775
You know how when you're
trying to last longer,

1518
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,961
you think about baseball?
Mmm-hmm.

1519
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,775
It's kind of like that.
Throws a haze in their head.

1520
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,240
It's the only way to survive when
you're married to a psychic.

1521
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:48,285
Come on, Ned. I know you're
thinking about fucking that doll.

1522
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,245
Hey, hey, hey.

1523
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:57,283
You've had enough.
Bye, doll.

1524
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:05,135
It's so nice being able to
just relax on the couch

1525
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,447
and watch The Bachelorette.
Yeah.

1526
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,051
Huh?

1527
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,290
You didn't hear that?

1528
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,845
What?

1529
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,846
My nigga senses is tinglin'.
It's like my Spidey senses.

1530
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,004
Oh, would you hush?
It is fine!

1531
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,164
My white senses say we're fine.

1532
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,527
Everything's okay.
It's over.

1533
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,683
Okay? It's over.

1534
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,643
Okay, okay. I'm trippin'.
That's right.

1535
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,802
Dead white bitch!

1536
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,760
You already know how it's going
down, motherfuckers, all right?

1537
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,922
I looked on my
Dora the Explorer app,

1538
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,560
this the motherfuckin'
correct address.

1539
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,690
This ain't a drive-by, homie, okay?
This a walk-in, homie.

1540
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,327
So ain't no escape plan!
My cousin is in here, cuz!

1541
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,209
Y'all ready?

1542
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:03,369
Hey, yo, Malcolm! Whassup, my niggie?

1543
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,041
Oh, shit!

1544
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:08,360
What the fuck are you
doin', man? I gotta run for it!

1545
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:12,975
This is bullshit! Oh, my God!
I'm scared as fuck!

1546
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,680
I'm good, dog. Let me get my
motherfuckin' bearings together, homie.

1547
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,882
All right,
let's go up in there, cuz.

1548
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,208
It smell like dead ass,

1549
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,243
baloney and sweat socks
up in there, homie.

1550
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,448
It smell like Honey Boo
Boo's boo-boo, homie!

1551
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,250
Malcolm?

1552
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,448
Where you at, cuz?

1553
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,924
Ain't nobody in here, cuz.

1554
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:44,050
Oh, shit!
Megan got fucked up!

1555
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,646
Head twisted all
backwards, niggie.

1556
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,924
Now, upon further
examination, my niggie,

1557
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,084
this white bitch smell like she
been dead about a week, maybe two.

1558
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,608
I watch Dexter, niggie, CSI: New
York, Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta.

1559
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,095
Don't nobody get killed on there,
but they need to, my nigga.

1560
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,520
Stevie J.,
you know what I'm sayin'?

1561
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,245
This bitch smell

1562
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:06,449
Yah! Taekwondo! Oh, shit!

Hello?

Hello?

1567
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,685
Oh, shit! There's another
dead body, cuz.

1568
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:26,607
Who the fuck is it, though, huh?
Who the fuck is it?

1569
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,441
Oh, God, it's Malcolm!

They done kill my cuz, cuz!

1571
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,487
It's like Boyz n the Hood, he's
supposed to go to college!

1572
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,695
Why the fuck they let
Doughboy live and Ricky dead?

1573
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,927
Doughboy was
the evil nigga, cuz!

1574
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,441
Oh!

1575
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,369
I can't believe this!

1576
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:46,051
See if the nigga got
some money, though.

1577
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,962
What you hit me for, brah?

1578
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,640
You know better than to be
poppin' up on me like that, cuz!

1579
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,162
You get knocked out every
motherfuckin' time, homie.

1580
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:02,005
World star! World star!

1581
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:03,720
You hit me with a brick!

1582
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,455
Where's my family?
Are they okay?

1583
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,935
Nigga, they dead as fuck!

1584

All of them?
Even the little boy?

1585
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,215
He's on the back of a motherfuckin'
milk carton, niggie!

1586
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,402
Good. He may have lived.

1587
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,011
Where's Kisha?

1588
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,055
Nigga, I don't know where
the fuck Kisha is at, cuz!

1589
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,815
Shh! Shh!

1590
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:20,895
Kisha did this shit?

1591
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,251
The white girl's neck,
snapped it back.

1592
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,655
Kisha did that shit?

1593
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,495
Nigga, that bitch
is gangsta, cuz!

1594
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,815
I need to jump
her in my shit, cuz!

1595
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,200
Shh! I came down to the basement
on some creep shit, like...

1596
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,365
I was just sittin' here waitin' for
this bitch, like, "Nigga, what?"

1597
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,735
"Bitch, you want

1598
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,335
So I'm gonna sit

1599
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,442

nigga, like what.

1600
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,524
Let my sneakers be all, so she
be like, "That nigga dead."

1601
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:44,082
The throat, like, "Bitch,

1602
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:48,040
You can't kill me! I'm like a roach!
I don't die, I multiply!

1603
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,727
I got God on my side, bitch!

1604
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:56,045
Twinkle, twinkle little star

1605
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,202
She's right
behind me, isn't she?

1606
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,409
How I wonder...
