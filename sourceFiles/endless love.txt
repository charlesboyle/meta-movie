DAVID: <i>There was a girl.</i>

2
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,692
<i>A beautiful girl
surrounded by people.</i>

3
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,427
<i>Yet utterly alone.</i>

4
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:55,156
<i>Her brother, Chris,
died sophomore year.</i>

5
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:58,951
<i>She spent all of her time
secluded with her family,</i>

6
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:02,663
<i>or in the comfort of books.</i>

7
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,816
<i>I watched her for
all of high school,</i>

8
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,069
<i>waiting for that perfect
moment to talk to her,</i>

9
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,237
<i>but that moment never came.</i>

10
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,923
(INAUDIBLE)

11
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,260
<i>I watched as people
gradually forgot about her.</i>

12
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,598
<i>And she seemed content
to disappear.</i>

13
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,267
<i>But not to me.</i>

14
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,395
<i>And although she didn't know it,</i>

15
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,482
<i>I saw the possibility of us.</i>

16
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,777
Jade Butterfield. Mmm.

17
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:36,012
Four years, and you
never talked to her.

18
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,889
Well, in my defense, no one did.

19
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,392
There is a reason for that.
She's an ice queen.

20
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:42,286
Girl can't be real.

21
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,271
You don't think she's real?

22
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,356
"You don't think..."

23
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:50,151
Girl looks like that, has that much
dough, can't be real, all right?

24
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,004
I know these things.

25
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,160
(CHUCKLES)

26
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,537
Ah, it's stupid, I know.

27
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:01,889
No, it's not.

28
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,209
Come on. Dad wants a photo
of the happy family.

29
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,711
Oh, whose family are we
taking a picture of?

30
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:09,063
Come on.

31
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,466
Jade, come take a picture.

32
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,385
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

33
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,529
Okay.

34
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,390
Thank you so much.
Will you take two?

35
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,034
Just to be safe.

36
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,578
Okay.

38
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,483
- There.
- Thank you.

39
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,069
- Congrats, honey.
- Thanks.

40
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,237
GIRL 1: That one's going online.

41
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:35,339
GIRL 2: Yeah.

42
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:39,743
I barely know those girls.

43
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,411
I didn't expect to
be in the picture.

44
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:42,787
Take a seat. Come on.

45
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:46,725

family photo can wait.

(CHUCKLES)

47
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:51,897
Promise me you won't do in
college what you did here.

48
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,844
Chris was an amazing brother,
and we all miss him,

49
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,697
but you can't stop living.

50
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,993
He'd want us to live
more, not less.

51
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,771
How's anyone ever gonna know how
ridiculous and funny you are

52
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:09,647
if all you ever do is hang
out with Mom and Dad?

53
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,608
- I don't just hang out with Mom and Dad.
- Oh, really?

54
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:12,817
How many kids signed this?

55
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,527
And, uh, you can't
include teachers.

56
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,629
Don't.

57
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,075
Thanks, Dad.

58
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:21,719
You're welcome, son.
I'm proud of you.

59
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,788
Thank you. It means a lot.

60
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,706
Maybe you should buy
a blowtorch, huh?

61
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,517
- To melt the ice off your girl.
- Mace...

62
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:30,460
- Your son's got a crush.
- No, I don't.

63
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,212
- Does he?
- No, I don't.

64
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,296
- Is she here?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,339
Which one is it?

66
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,466
- Jade Butterfield. Mmm-hmm.
- HARRY: That blonde over there?

67
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,551
- Don't you dare. No.
- Hey, Jade!

68
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,803

Jade, I want you to meet my son!

- The greatest kid here!

DAVID: Hey, you guys. Come on, man!

73
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:49,872
Whoo-hoo. My son, the

Oh, wow. Mr. Schwartz,
thank you. This is too much.

Mrs. Schwartz. You guys take
care now, all right? Okay.

Dude, you going to
Jenny's Saturday night?

80
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,769
Really? Again?

81
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,462
- Come on.
- Don't do this.

82
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,007
Do you have any idea how your
constant break-ups affect my life?

83
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,091
I'm so sorry.

84
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,801
The energy, man, it gets all
awkward and shit, all right?

85
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,594
Just get back together
with her so I can

86
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,304
go back to the life
I'm accustomed to.

87
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,658
Can you act like a
respectable human being?

88
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,018
You're the first
face the guests see.

89
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,912
And yet they keep coming back.

give me a nice spot?

Will do, sir. Take care.

101
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,317
I should go.

00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,611
Okay.

to start and your pasta special.

My daughter's gonna have the
steak, medium, and soup to start.

111

Good?

112
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,583
- Yeah.
- WAITER: And for you?

113
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,336
I think I can handle this myself.

114
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:03,697
I'm gonna go for the burger and
fries. Medium rare, please.

115
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,758
And a Crown and Coke. Better
make it a double, actually.

116
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,867
You're here from ASU
for two short months.

117

Let's just try and
keep it pleasant.

118

That's why I got the double, Dad.

We've been going back and forth over
what to get you for graduation.

We know we haven't done very
well with the holidays and so on

123
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,472
and that's not been
fair to you or Keith.

124
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,974
I don't need anything.

125
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:33,810
We could go shopping. We could
get a new wardrobe for Brown.

126
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:34,894
Yeah, you should
think of something,

127
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,146

with a photo of this guy.

you could ask for?

the kids at school today

to make friends you'll keep forever.

happening and called the cops.

mean "choreograph"?

00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:40,804
I had the right one
laying around the shop,

533
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:43,431
so I thought you might
wanna hear her run again.

536
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:51,832
- It's no big deal.
- JADE: Thank you.

537
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:53,650
I never thought I'd
hear that sound again.

00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:04,327
Look, Jade told me how much
this car meant to you.

540
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:06,496
And I tried to rack my brain
around something I could do,

541
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:11,352
seeing as, you know, we got off on
the wrong foot the other night.

543
00:29:11,377 --> 00:29:12,895
The other night.

closet with my daughter.

546
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:20,569
Dad, he did this for us.

It's a very kind gesture, David.

548
00:29:23,556 --> 00:29:26,325
Would you maybe, um,
join us for dinner?

549
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,934
I wasn't looking for an invite.

550
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,245
I should go home and shower.

551
00:29:29,395 --> 00:29:31,455
You could wash up here.
I have to get changed.

552
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:32,647

No, you wouldn't be
intruding, honestly.

00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:40,089

- Come on.

You might not know this, David,

558

but, uh, Jade is following
in her father's footsteps,

559
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:50,874
enrolling pre-med in the fall.

560
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:55,646
And since I'm kind of hoping
for a specialty in cardiology,

561
00:29:56,756 --> 00:30:00,985

celebrate than with a family heirloom.

You've gotten me enough.

563

00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:19,003
Well, I think pre-med
at Brown earns it.

569
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:22,798
Not to mention your internship
with Dr. Fitzgerald.

570
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:25,468
Internship? You never
mentioned that.

571
00:30:25,785 --> 00:30:27,118
It's not a big deal, that's why.

572
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,203
Very big deal.

00:30:28,204 --> 00:30:30,497
I mean, she'll be leaving and
spending, I don't know, most of...

574
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:32,874
Um, I, uh, had to
declare my major, too.

had to major in something, so...

Always wondered what that meant.

579
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,737
It's the study of
how we communicate.

Well, you know, you can always change
it later if it doesn't make sense.

All right, David. Your turn.

pass, you can pass.

doesn't call you his girlfriend.

Okay, David, look, we know your
act of generosity with the car

587
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:08,410
wasn't really about anything
other than my daughter, so...

(LAUGHING)

I'd just love to know a
little more about you,

590
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:13,456
other than the fact you
can fix an old car.

591
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:15,726
I'm sure that's not your
most noteworthy quality.

I mean, it might be.

that discourage you.

That's an amazing score, David.

604

You could get into
UGA with that score.

605
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:42,419
Maybe. But I like working
in my dad's shop.

wrong with that.

- Oh, no, Hugh.

Speaking as someone who's been
married for over two decades.

614
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:06,986
I mean, love is wonderful,
but it's not all you need.

616
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:10,614
You also need things
like life insurance

617
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:14,326
and PPOs and unromantic
things, like mortgages.

618
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:16,162
I get that.

619
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:18,688
I mean, I'm sure
I'll have all those things one day,

620
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:21,149
but I do think
that love comes first, you know?

what's more important than that?

like when it's not.

They met when they were in high
school, and it made sense.

That's what I wanna find.
True love.

The kind that you fight for,
that you always put first.

634
00:32:56,435 --> 00:33:00,664
That makes you wanna
be good and do better.

635

And not just with any girl.

636
00:33:04,777 --> 00:33:06,212

you don't have one either.

never treat Jade that way.

think I want for my daughter?

That was a long time ago.
That's not me.

learned more from your past.

01:08:04,502 --> 01:08:05,669
Don't you talk about my dad.

1233
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:07,837
No, I mean, everything I hear,
he sounds like a great guy.

1234
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:12,026
Works hard, puts a roof over
your head, does the best he can.

1235
01:08:12,843 --> 01:08:15,224
It was never quite enough for
your mother, though, was it?

1236
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:17,114
You have nothing.

1237
01:08:17,556 --> 01:08:19,307
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1238
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:22,578
One day you get home early from
school, there's another man there.

1239
01:08:22,978 --> 01:08:24,705
And what do you do, David?

1240
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:26,791
You beat him.

1241
01:08:26,857 --> 01:08:30,026
You beat him so badly he has to
be taken away in an ambulance.

1242
01:08:30,027 --> 01:08:33,964
So he goes to the hospital, you go
to juvie, and your mom takes off.

1244
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:37,534
You know that love that you
talked about at dinner?

1245
01:08:37,535 --> 01:08:39,515
You're never gonna have that.
It doesn't exist.

1246
01:08:39,537 --> 01:08:42,872
Your story isn't gonna end any
differently than your parents' did.

1247
01:08:42,873 --> 01:08:46,018
Jade will get bored with you.

1248
01:08:46,377 --> 01:08:48,086
Just like your mom got bored.

1249
01:08:48,087 --> 01:08:49,713
And how are you going
to handle yourself when

1250
01:08:49,714 --> 01:08:52,233
that happens again, David? Huh?

1251
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:53,967
Because it will.

1252
01:08:53,968 --> 01:08:55,719
It doesn't matter how hard you try.

1253
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,221
You're not gonna be
able to hang on to her.

1254
01:08:58,222 --> 01:09:00,390
She is gonna get to Brown.

1255
01:09:00,391 --> 01:09:04,829
She is gonna meet somebody like
her, smart, with a future,

1257
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:07,248
and she's gonna leave.

1258
01:09:07,356 --> 01:09:09,375
And she won't look back.

1259
01:09:09,442 --> 01:09:10,835
You know why?

1260
01:09:14,905 --> 01:09:16,740
Because you're not good enough.

1261
01:09:16,741 --> 01:09:18,843

You had my entire family fooled.

1268

Never me.

1269
01:09:49,482 --> 01:09:51,459
This is the real you.

What happened?

1274
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:17,801
What do you think? David lost it.

1275
01:10:17,802 --> 01:10:19,302
I tried to fend him off, and he...

1276
01:10:19,303 --> 01:10:20,845
I don't believe you.

1277
01:10:20,846 --> 01:10:22,239
Look at me.

1278
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:24,599
He completely lost control.

1279
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,684
I told him you were leaving...

1280
01:10:25,685 --> 01:10:27,477
You told him?
Why would you tell him that?

1281
01:10:27,478 --> 01:10:29,455
Because you wouldn't have.

1282
01:10:29,647 --> 01:10:31,415
And it's time he knows the truth.

1283
01:10:32,358 --> 01:10:34,084
Jade, what...

1284
01:10:35,361 --> 01:10:36,921
No.

1285
01:10:37,655 --> 01:10:40,824
He peppers him with a right,
he peppers him with a left.

1286
01:10:40,825 --> 01:10:43,034
He's got Hugh Butterfield
in the corner.

01:10:43,035 --> 01:10:44,428
(CHUCKLING) What's he up to?

1288
01:10:45,037 --> 01:10:46,388
Damn, did you hit her dad?

1289
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,768
That's messed up, even for you.

1290
01:10:52,837 --> 01:10:54,337
You should've never taken
us there last night.

1291

Whoa.

01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:57,775
It sucks that you got caught,
but it's not my fault.

Come on, man, we used to do
shit like that all the time.

Yeah, but back then I didn't
have anything to lose.

to Brown now, too?

I know you've been lost
in this whole Jade world.

come to pick you up?

happened with your mom.

you had just told me.
