01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,450
Well, if that's the idea...

1755
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:26,780
...you can count me out.

1756
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:27,950
See, nowadays people...

1757
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:29,070
...begin by sneering...

1758
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,200
...at family life and family institutions...

1759
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:33,330
...and the next you'll know, we'll...

1760
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,250
...throw everything overboard,
we'll have intermarriage...

1761
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:36,790
...between black and white!

1762
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:37,960
GATSBY:
Your wife doesn't love you.

1763
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:44,919
She never...

1764
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:45,920
...loved you.

1765
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,390
You see, she loves me.

1766
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:53,270
You must be crazy.

1767
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:55,560
No, old sport.

1768
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:59,110
No, you see, she never loved you.

1769
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,190
She only married you
because I was poor...

1770
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,400
...and she was tired of waiting.
It was a terrible...

1771
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:06,910
...terrible mistake, but in her heart...

1772
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:08,490
In her heart, she never loved...

1773
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:09,950
...anyone but me.

1774
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,620
- We should go.
- Let's all go home.

1775
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:13,660
- Sit down, Daisy!
GATSBY: Please.

1776
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:15,500
Please, take a seat.

1777
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:17,960
Go on, Daisy.

1778
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:20,960
TOM:
Daisy...

1779
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:23,420
...what's been going on?

1780
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:25,720
- I want to hear about it.
- I told you what's going on.

1781
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:27,590
It's been going on for five years.

1782
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:29,640
You've been seeing him...

1783
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:32,180
...for five years?

1784
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:35,640
No, no, no, not seeing.
Not seeing, we couldn't. But...

1785
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:38,810
...both of us loved each other
all that time. Didn't we?

1786
01:37:39,190 --> 01:37:40,190
TOM:
Oh, that's all.

1787
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:42,940
Ha-ha-ha! You're crazy!

1788
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:44,535
I can't speak about...

1789
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:47,950
...what happened five years ago
because I didn't know Daisy then.

1790
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:51,070
And I'll be damned if I see how
you got within a mile of her...

1791
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,990
...unless you brought the groceries
to the back door.

1792
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,410
But all the rest of that...

1793
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:56,960
...is a goddamn lie.

1794
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:57,999
Daisy loved me...

1795
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,620
...when she married me...

1796
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,460
...and she loves me now.
GATSBY: No.

1797
01:38:01,630 --> 01:38:04,050
- No. I'm sorry, Mr. Buchanan, no.
TOM: She does! She does, though.

1798
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:05,210
No, she does, though.

1799
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:07,840
She does. And what's more, I love Daisy too.

1800
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:10,130
No.

1801
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:12,220
I love you, Daisy.

1802
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:14,390
Now, once in a while...

1803
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,020
...I go off on a spree. I always come back.

1804
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:18,435
A spree.

1805
01:38:18,436 --> 01:38:19,690
TOM: And in my heart I
love her all the time.

1806
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:21,190
You're revolting.

1807
01:38:21,350 --> 01:38:22,350
You know why we left...

1808
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,400
...Chicago? I'm surprised
they didn't treat you...

1809
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:26,110
...to the story of that little spree!

1810
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:29,280
That's all over now, Daisy, darling.
That's all over.

1811
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:30,990
Just tell him the truth. Go on.

1812
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:35,030
That you never loved him
and this will all be wiped out forever.

1813
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,330
How could I love him...

1814
01:38:36,490 --> 01:38:38,660
...possibly?
GATSBY: Remember our plans.

1815
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:40,710
You tell him that you never loved him
and all...

1816
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:42,500
...this pain will be wiped out...

1817
01:38:42,670 --> 01:38:43,670
...forever.

1818
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:45,630
Daisy.

1819
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:49,300
Daisy, tell him.

1820
01:38:49,510 --> 01:38:50,840
I never loved him.

1821
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:53,680
Never?

1822
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:55,890
- No.
- No.

1823
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:58,890
Not at Kapiolani?

1824
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:05,940
Not that day I carried you down from
the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?

1825
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:11,900
Never?

1826
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:14,450
Please don't.

1827
01:39:15,070 --> 01:39:16,240
Daisy.

1828
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:19,250
There, Jay.

1829
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:21,080
You want too much.

1830
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:22,540
I love you now...

1831
01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:24,170
...isn't that enough? I can't help...

1832
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:25,500
...what's past.

1833
01:39:25,670 --> 01:39:28,090
I did love him once,
but I loved you too.

1834
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,260
You loved me too?

1835
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:34,640
You loved me...?

1836
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:35,800
Even that is a lie!

1837
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:36,970
She didn't know you were alive!

1838
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:38,770
There are things between Daisy and me...

1839
01:39:38,930 --> 01:39:40,270
...Gatsby, that you'll never know.

1840
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:42,190
- Things that neither of us can ever forget.
GATSBY: I need to...

1841
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:43,520
...speak to Daisy alone.

1842
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:47,020
You see, you've got her
all excited now, don't you...

1843
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:49,030
...old sport? Daisy.
DAISY: Even alone...

1844
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:51,990
...I can't say I never loved Torn.
It wouldn't be true.

1845
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:53,320
- What?
- Of course it wouldn't.

1846
01:39:53,490 --> 01:39:55,530
- As if it mattered to you.
TOM: Of course it matters!

1847
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:57,490
I'm gonna take better care of you
from now on.

1848
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:00,910
You're not taking care of Daisy
anymore. She's leaving you.

1849
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:02,250
Nonsense!

1850
01:40:02,410 --> 01:40:04,290
- I am, though!
TOM: No, no, no.

1851
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:05,500
She is not leaving me.

1852
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:06,670
Certainly not...

1853
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:08,170
...for a common swindler...

1854
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:09,340
...like you.

1855
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,970
Mr. Gatsby, exactly who are you, anyhow?

1856
01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:13,170
I made an investigation...

1857
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:14,720
...into your affairs. You're one...

1858
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,050
...of Meyer Wolfshiem's bunch.

1859
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:17,600
Please, let's go home.

1860
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,180
See, he and this Wolfshiem...

1861
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:20,770
...they bought up drugstores.

1862
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:22,180
And sold bootlegged...

1863
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:23,480
...alcohol over the counter.

1864
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:24,980
What about it, old sport?

1865
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:26,350
Don't you call me "old sport."

1866
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:27,940
And this drugstore business...

1867
01:40:28,110 --> 01:40:30,610
...is just small change
compared to this bonds stunt...

1868
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:32,240
...that you and Wolfshiem
have got going.

1869
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,440
Your friend Walter Chase...

1870
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:35,240
- ...isn't too proud to come in?
- I gave u..

1871
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:36,375
...that some thought.

1872
01:40:36,410 --> 01:40:37,740
How does a reputable banker...

1873
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:39,580
...like Walter Chase find himself...

1874
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:41,200
...up to his eyeballs in debt...

1875
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:43,200
GATSBY: I'll tell you.
- ...to a little kike like Wolfshiem?

1876
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:45,620
- It's called greed, old sport.
TOM: That's right!

1877
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:48,750
And you have half of Wall Street
out there swilling your...

1878
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:51,670
...free booze at that fun park
every weekend.

1879
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,340
I'm surprised he hasn't
tried to drag you in.

1880
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:57,260
My God, he has.

1881
01:40:57,430 --> 01:40:58,680
He's got nothing to do with-

1882
01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:00,140
With your little racket.

1883
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:03,680
Daisy.

1884
01:41:03,890 --> 01:41:05,140
Daisy.

1885
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,400
Can't you see who this guy is...

1886
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:13,440
...with his house and his parties
and his fancy clothes?

1887
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:16,070
He is just a front...

1888
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,360
...for Wolfshiem, a gangster...

1889
01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:20,870
...to get his claws into respectable folk
like Walter Chase.

1890
01:41:21,030 --> 01:41:24,330
The only respectable thing about you,
old sport, is your money.

1891
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,330
Your money, that's it.
Now I've just as much...

1892
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:27,870
...as you. That means we're equal.

1893
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,040
Oh, no. No.

1894
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:31,420
We're different.

1895
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:33,800
I am.

1896
01:41:34,090 --> 01:41:35,300
They are.

1897
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:36,590
She is.

1898
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,090
We're all different from you.

1899
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,220
You see, we were born...

1900
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,220
...different.

1901
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,680
It's in our blood...

1902
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:48,810
...and nothing that you do
or say or steal...

1903
01:41:49,230 --> 01:41:51,560
...or dream up can ever change that.

1904
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:53,690

You shut up! Shut up!

1908
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:00,370
Shut up!

hundreds that enjoyed his hospitality...</i>

<i>...attended the funeral.</i>

2279

<i>And from Daisy...</i>

2281

2282

<i>That city...</i>

<i>...I returned to that huge...</i>

<i>Wolfshiem's associates...</i>

He threw all those parties...</i>

2295
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:48,390
<i>...hoping she'd wander in one night.</i>

It's like an amusement park.

But how do you live here all alone?</i>

2298

She makes it look so splendid...

2299
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:55,690
...don't you think, old sport?

Music! And then we can...

2301
02:06:57,940 --> 02:06:59,570

DAISY:
I wish it could always be like this.

2305
02:07:06,410 --> 02:07:08,080
It Will be.

<i>NICK: I remembered how we had all come to
Gatsby's and guessed at his corruption...</i>

2308
02:07:18,550 --> 02:07:19,379

2309

The moon rose higher.</i>

2312
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:40,700
<i>And as I stood there,
brooding on the old, unknown world...</i>

2313
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:43,780
<i>...I thought of Gatsby's wonder...</i>

2314
02:07:43,950 --> 02:07:47,700
<i>...when he first picked out the green light
at the end of Daisy's dock.</i>

2315
02:07:53,290 --> 02:07:55,630
<i>He had come such a long way.</i>

2316
02:07:56,420 --> 02:07:58,880
<i>And his dream
must have seemed so close...</i>

2317

<i>...that he could hardly fail to grasp it.</i>

2318
02:08:06,350 --> 02:08:07,470
<i>But he did not know...</i>

2319
02:08:07,640 --> 02:08:09,770
<i>...that it was already behind him.</i>

2320
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:14,560
<i>Gatsby believed in the green light...</i>

2321
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:18,150
<i>...the orgastic future
that year by year recedes...</i>

2322
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:19,440
<i>...before us.</i>

2323
02:08:19,610 --> 02:08:22,360
<i>It eluded us then, but that's no matter.</i>

2324
02:08:22,740 --> 02:08:25,490
<i>Tomorrow, we will run faster...</i>

2325

<i>...stretch out our arms farther...</i>

2326
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:31,200
<i>...and one fine morning...</i>

2327
02:08:31,370 --> 02:08:33,460
<i>So we beat on...</i>

2328
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:36,250
<i>...boats against the current...</i>

2329
02:08:36,830 --> 02:08:38,590
<i>...borne back...</i>

2330
02:08:38,750 --> 02:08:40,590
<i>...ceaselessly...</i>

02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:43,010
<i>...into the past.</i>
