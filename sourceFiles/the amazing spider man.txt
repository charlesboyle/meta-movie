So because of the cold blood,

1329

Mr. Mayor,
if there was a giant dinosaur

1350
01:22:52,538 --> 01:22:55,041
running around
you would be the first to know.

1351
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,777

he can rest easy, all right?

1352
01:22:57,943 --> 01:22:59,980
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

1353
01:23:00,145 --> 01:23:02,352
Okay. Bye-bye.

1355
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:06,393

Got a free track.

1356
01:23:06,552 --> 01:23:07,826
Okay, well, I do not.

1357
01:23:07,987 --> 01:23:09,227
So make your point quickly.

1358
01:23:09,388 --> 01:23:11,800
Fine, there may not be
a dinosaur running around.

1359
01:23:11,957 --> 01:23:14,233
There is something more
dangerous, and I know who.

1360
01:23:14,393 --> 01:23:15,997
You know who?
Dr. Curtis Connors.

1361
01:23:16,161 --> 01:23:17,538
He's a biochemist.
Of Oscorp?

1362
01:23:17,696 --> 01:23:19,198
That's right.
Dr. Connors,

1363
01:23:19,365 --> 01:23:21,367
who's my daughter's mentor.
Is that who?

1364
01:23:21,533 --> 01:23:22,739
That's the one.
Okay.

1365
01:23:22,901 --> 01:23:26,212
Recently, Dr. Connors gave Gwen
a college recommendation.

1366
01:23:26,372 --> 01:23:28,409
It was beautiful.
When I read it, I cried.

1367

You would have me believe
that he

1368
01:23:30,909 --> 01:23:33,150

like a dinosaur?

1369
01:23:33,312 --> 01:23:36,987

has transformed himself into a lizard.

I'm telling you the absolute truth.

1374

This man has worked for his whole
life on cross-species genetics.

1375
01:23:51,064 --> 01:23:54,602
He lost an arm, he tried to grow it
back, but the equation was imbalanced.

1376
01:23:54,801 --> 01:23:57,247
He has turned into a lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

1377
01:23:57,404 --> 01:24:01,113
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

1378
01:24:01,307 --> 01:24:03,753
Okay. All right, I get it.
