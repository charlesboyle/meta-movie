1
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,400
My name is Dalton Russell.

2
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,100
Pay strict attention to what I say

3
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,000
because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

4
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,000
I've told you my name. That's the "who."

5
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,300
The "where" could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,200
But there's a vast difference

7
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,800
between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,000
The "what" is easy.

9
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,400
Recently I planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

10
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,300
That's also the "when. "

11
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,900
As for the "why,"
beyond the obvious financial motivation,

12
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,600
it's exceedingly simple.

13
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,200
Because I can.

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,800
Which leaves us only with the "how. "

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,100
And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,900
lies the rub.

17
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,300
So, your mother tells me about

18
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,900
a certain young lady who's helping you
with the Triborough Bridge project?

19
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,200
- Okay?
- All right, okay.

20
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,300
He's crazy.

21
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,500
- Now? On 51st? 50...
Yeah, that's where he is right now.

22
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,500
He's on 40, he... No, he's still on 47th Street,
but it's a much smaller space.

23
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,400
What do I have to...

24
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,600
Yeah, we'll get lobster.
I'll put it on Mr Ansinori's card.

25
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Whatever. It's a meeting
with one of his clients or something.

26
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Because it's been like over a year now.
Yeah.

27
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,800
I want to snap this guy's neck,
I swear to God.

28
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,300
So what?

29
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,100
So what? They're flowers.
They could've been to his grandmother.

30
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,100
They could've been to me.
It's my birthday, so...

31
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,500
Okay, so maybe it's a client's.

32
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Okay. This is funny.

33
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
I got this guy in front of me
that thinks I don't see him looking at me.

34
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,800
Fantastic. God damn it.

35
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,500
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

36
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,100
Can you lower your voice
just a little bit, please?

37
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,100
You're getting a little loud on your phone.
Please.

38
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,500
Yeah. Fine.

39
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,200
I don't want you
disturbing the other customers.

40
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,600
- Sorry.
- All right?

41
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,600
- Yeah, you got it.
- Thank you.

42
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,300
It was a security guy.

43
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,600
I didn't know I was in a library.
It's a fucking bank.

44
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,300
Manhattan Trust.

45
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,300
...from Yale.
And this fucking rich prick I work for.

46
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,000
Thank you.

47
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,900
Excuse me. Sir?

48
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,300
Easy.

49
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,800
Everybody get down on the fucking floor!
Now!

50
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,500
Get down on the ground!

51
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,400
You have four seconds!
Anyone still standing gets shot!

52
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,800
One! Two! Three!

53
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,600
Back away from that counter!
Get your hand away from that button!

54
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,900
Put your hands on the floor! Now!

55
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,800
Oh... What the... What is this?

56
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,100
- Todd, what are we gonna do?
- What the fuck do you want me to do?

57
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
Keep your head down, fat man!
- All right!

58
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,800
Get your fucking face on the floor!

59
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,500
You get the same treatment
as everyone else, Rabbi.

60
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,100
Get down.

61
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,400
Now, my friends and I are making

62
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,200
a very large withdrawal from this bank.

63
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,800
Anybody gets in our way
gets a bullet in the brain.

64
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,500
Lie down, old man!
Put your fucking hands down!

65
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,000
Get your face on the floor.
All right, I'm down! I'm down!

66
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,100
Hey, Officer,
there's smoke coming out of there.

67
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,300
Possible 10-30. Manhattan Trust.
20 Exchange Place.

68
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,300
I have got hostages.

69
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,200
You fucking cops come near this door,
I start killing people.

70
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,500
I not fucking kidding, man.

71
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,500
Central. Give me an 85.

72
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,300
Back up, sir! Back up! You!

73
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,800
Shit!
- Back up! Back up!

74
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,500
Stay around the corner!

75
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,400
Central, give me an 85.

76
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,800
Perp with a gun. Possible hostages.

77
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,100
I repeat, possible hostages.
20 Exchange. Manhattan Trust.

78
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,000
Baby, I'm fighting for my life over here.

79
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,900
Keith, every time we have this conversation,
it's the same thing.

80
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,400
- "Not now. "
- Listen. Listen.

81
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Do you know what kind of thin ice
I'm on right now

82
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,700
with this cheque-cashing thing?
They want to lock me up.

83
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,000
If this $140,000 doesn't show up
somewhere soon,

84
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,300
- things gonna get rough for me.
- But you didn't take it.

85
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,100
Of course I didn't take it, baby.
It's just some lying drug dealer

86
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,200
trying to save his own ass
by fucking me over.

87
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,000
- Eventually, it'll go away.
- Then what?

88
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,400
- What about us?
- Then, you know, I'll make First Grade

89
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,300
and we'll have enough money
to buy a bigger place and then, you know...

90
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,100
Why we got to have this conversation
every time your brother gets locked up

91
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,100
- or gets caught stealing a car?
- He's the only family I've got.

92
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,100
All right, I'm sorry, baby. You okay?

93
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,900
- You still love me?
- I'm sorry, too.

94
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
- You still love me?
- I love you, baby.

95
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,700
All right. Big Willie and the twins for you
when I get home.

96
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,100
- I got the handcuffs.
- I got the gun.

97
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,700
Bye, Big Daddy.

98
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,000
- Big Willie and the twins, huh?
- That's correct.

99
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,900
Her lowlife brother, he's got three priors,
one for armed robbery.

100
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,300
17-year-old high-school dropout.
Doesn't have an honest bone in his body

101
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,700
and he's too fucking stupid
to amount to anything. Even as a criminal.

102
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,200
- Can't you get rid of him?
- I could, couldn't I?

103
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,700
No, she loves him. What am I gonna do?
Put him out in the street?

104
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,400
- How's he feel about you?
- Oh, he's thrilled.

105
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,100
To have a detective
sleeping in the next room,

106
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,400
banging his sister.
Then she tries to bring it all back on me.

107
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,100
You know, "If we had a bigger place,
we wouldn't have this problem. "

108
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,800
Of course, if we got married
then things would be different.

109
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,800
- And what's wrong with that?
- A wedding. Furniture. Kids.

110
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,500
You know what a diamond ring costs?

111
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,800
- Come on, man. You've been married.
- Please. I was 21.

112
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,300
- Yeah, but you give her a ring?
- Yeah, but she won't call me back.

113
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,500
- You guys cops?
- Oh, shit! He made us!

114
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,000
Christmas came early for you this year.

115
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Bank robbery. Hostage situation.
20 Exchange Place.

116
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
- What?
- Grossman's on vacation. You're up.

117
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,200
What about the Madrugada thing?
The cheque-cashing thing?

118
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,600
- I thought I was in the doghouse.
- I just threw you a bone.

119
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,400
As far as I'm concerned, you still work here,

120
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,700
- but if you don't think you're ready...
- No, no, he's ready!

121
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,500
Oh, good. Good.

122
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,100
I'm giving you a break, here.
Don't make me look like a fool.

123
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,700
- This is it, baby. The show!
- Yeah.

124
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,400
You got the call, man. God damn!

125
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,100
I guess I should be happy.
I might get to put off I.A.B.

126
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,100
Here's all you need to know.
You walk in unarmed.

127
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,900
Head bad guy puts a gun to your head
and makes you get on your knees.

128
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,700
You look around. There are five armed men
pointing Uzis at you.

129
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,400
Just picture them in their underwear.

130
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,000
How about orange jumpsuits and shackles?

131
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,300
- There you go, Keith. You can do this, man.
- Look out, bad guys. Here I come.

132
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,300
Get back around the corner!
Get back!

133
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,900
I told you, move it! Move it!

134
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,800
Get those people back!
Get them the hell out of here!

135
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,700
All right, guys, as soon as we pull up,
I want everybody out.

136
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,900
The second floor window. Now.

137
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,100
- Let them in there!
- Let's go! Go now!

138
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,500
Sarge, what do you got?

139
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,200
I got a perp in the bank.
Possible hostage situation.

140
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,600
Who's on today? Who's your boss?

141
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,800
- Sergeant Hernandez. I'll get him over here.
- Get him down here.

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,300
- Sergeant Hernandez, you on the air?
- On the air. Go.

143
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,100
Sarge, I got Sergeant Collins over here.
He called this in.

144
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,600
Can you come over to the other side?

145
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,000
Redirect, on my way. Let's go.

146
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,300
Back up! Go around,
around the corner.

147
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,700
Pull back. Pull it back.
We got to keep this secure.

148
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,900
- Collins? What you got?
- Hernandez.

149
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,100
I got a perp inside with a gun.
He claims he's got some hostages in there.

150
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,800
Everyone, heads up! Let's clear the way!

151
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,000
Let's go. Set them up. All right.

152
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,700
We've got it under control.

153
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,000
Step back, please!

154
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,200
- Step back!
- Get back! Thank you.

155
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,200
There's nothing going on.

156
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,300
You'll see it on the news tonight.

157
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,100
Step back, please.

158
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,300
Mr Case?

159
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh, good morning, Katherine.
What can I do for you?

160
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,300
Sir, there's a robbery in progress
at one of our branches.

161
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,600
Oh, my.

162
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,000
- Has anybody been hurt?
- I don't think so, but there are hostages.

163
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,600
Oh, how awful.

164
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,300
- Which branch is it?
- Number 32. 20 Exchange Place.

165
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,400
- Which one?
-20 Exchange Place.

166
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,900
Thank you, Katherine.

167
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,700
I'm sorry, Mr Case.

168
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh, dear God.

169
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,100
Get these people out of here.
Come on, open these gates. Back up.

170
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,500
Up on the sidewalk. Come on in.

171
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,600
Sergeant Collins, first on scene.
Are you the hostage negotiator?

172
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,500
That's right. Detective Frazier.
This is Detective Mitchell. What do you got?

173
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,500
Not much.
Saw the bank was filled with smoke.

174
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,900
The door was locked.
I tried to take a look inside

175
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,300
and one of the gunmen opens the door,
sticks a. 357 in my face,

176
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,000
screaming in some foreign accent
about killing hostages.

177
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,800
- See any other gunmen?
- No, sir. I couldn't see anything at all.

178
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,500
- You hear anything inside?
- No, sir,

179
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,700
but with that. 357 sticking in my face,
I can't really be sure. I'm sorry.

180
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Okay.

181
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,900
Good, good. Good, good, good, good.
You did a good job, Sergeant.

182
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,300
You ever had a gun
stuck in your face before?

183
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
- Yeah, once.
- Really?

184
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,400
Yeah, by a 12-year-old.

185
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,700
- What was that like?
- Not one of my better days.

186
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I bet. All right, well, look.

187
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,800
As soon as we get this thing cleared up,
we'll cut you loose, all right?

188
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,800
If you don't mind,
I'd rather hang around a while,

189
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,600
at least until we make contact.

190
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,800
That's what I like to hear, Sergeant.

191
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,600
What? Come on. Why you doing this?
Why you doing this to me?

192
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,500
Pop, what's going on? Yo.

193
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,500
All bank employees,
raise your hands!

194
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,600
Bank employees, this side!
Everyone else, over there!

195
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,400
Now, I need everybody
to take your cell phones and your keys

196
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,200
out of your pockets and handbags
and hold them in the air.

197
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,900
- What's your name?
- Peter.

198
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,500
- Peter what?
- Peter Hammond.

199
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,000
- Where's your cell phone, Peter Hammond?
- I left it at home.

200
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,700
Peter, think very carefully
about how you answer the next question

201
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,100
because if you get it wrong,
your headstone will read,

202
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,300
"Here lies Peter Hammond, hero,

203
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,700
"who valiantly attempted
to prevent a brilliant bank robbery

204
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,600
"by trying to hide his cellular phone,

205
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,200
"but wound up getting shot
in the fucking head. "

206
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,500
Now, Peter Hammond,

207
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,000
where is your cell phone?

208
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,600
I'm telling you, I did. I left it at home.

209
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,100
Okay, I fucked up. I'm sorry. Please.

210
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,200
Hey. Don't worry about it.

211
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Just let me talk to you!
Please, please, listen to me.

212
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,500
Let me explain.

213
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,100
Help! Help me.

214
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Stop!

215
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
Stop!

216
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,800
Anyone else here smarter than me?

217
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,100
- And you are?
- Vikram Walia.

218
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,900
Vikram Walia. Thanks, Vikram.

219
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,300
Hey, mister.

220
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,700
Keep it.

221
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,300
Men here. Women here.

222
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,800
Move!

223
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,000
I need all of you
to strip down to your underwear.

224
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Now.

225
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,300
Lady?

226
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,900
Believe me. This is the only situation
where I'd ask you to do this.

227
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,700
- But take off your fucking clothes.
- No.

228
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,100
You should be ashamed of yourself.

229
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,500
What's with you mishegoyim?

230
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,900
Go ahead. Make my day.

231
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,500
- Take your fucking clothes off, lady.
- No!

232
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,600
Stevie?

233
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,400
Let's go!

234
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,300
Now, I need all of you

235
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,300
to put on one of these suits
and these masks.

236
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,500
I'm Shon Gables, with CBS 2 News,
outside Manhattan Trust Bank,

237
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,200
where we have just been told
by investigators,

238
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,000
the bank has been robbed.

239
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,200
The suspect or possible suspects are inside,

240
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,200
holed up with an unknown number
of hostages.

241
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,900
- Captain Darius?
- Yeah.

242
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,900
I'm Detective Frazier.
This is Detective Mitchell.

243
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
Hey.

244
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,500
You may remember,
we worked that hospital thing on 93rd,

245
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,300
during my training?

246
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,700
Oh, yeah. That was a real shame.

247
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah, it was. It was.

248
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,400
So, what do we got?

249
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,100
I got an unknown number of suspects
and an unknown number of hostages,

250
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,600
and a bank, and about a million spectators,
and I can't see shit inside there,

251
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,600
- so I'm kind of busy.
- I understand.

252
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,300
The way this works, Mr Frazier,
is I deal with Mr Grossman.

253
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,700
So if you need anything,
you can speak with him, okay?

254
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,800
No, it's not okay, Captain.

255
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,300
Detective Grossman is away on vacation,

256
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,300
so Detective Frazier
is the big dick today, all right?

257
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,900
Now, if you need anything,
you can speak to me, all right?

258
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,400
I guess it'll have to be.

259
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,800
That's the way it's gonna be.
You got vests for us?

260
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,200
- Berk!
Yo!

261
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,100
- Get these guys some vests!
- Okay.

262
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,100
- And check them into the command log.
- Okay.

263
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,800
You know what?
I'm gonna get out of your hair

264
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,800
and let you get control
of this crime scene, okay?

265
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,200
You'll let me know when you're ready
with a detailed briefing?

266
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,200
- Okay.
- We're gonna take a walk down to the diner.

267
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,200
Don't go in the bank without calling us first,
all right? Okay?

268
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,800
- All right.
- Good to see you, Captain.

269
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,000
Shouldn't we be in there?

270
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,700
Let's give him some time. See what he does.
Come on.

271
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,100
Until he secures his position
and gets the physical layout,

272
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,500
he'll only dump on us.

273
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,900
If the show starts, he'll call us.
Trust me. I've seen him work.

274
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,200
Your call, Keith.

275
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,500
Can you get that for me?
I guess it is, isn't it?

276
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,400
That's the one thing I learnt
from Grossman,

277
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,700
is these guys don't have much respect
for what we do.

278
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,200
- How do you mean?
- Well, to them it's a tactical situation.

279
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,300
Us being here means there's
a mental side to it that they don't get.

280
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,800
- Told you, you could handle this.
- Yeah.

281
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,200
I keep waiting for someone higher up
on the food chain to show up and say,

282
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,500
"Here's what we do. "

283
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,900
What happened at the hospital?

284
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,800
Guy shot himself, shot his girlfriend.
Thank you.

285
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,400
I told you, I've got

286
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,100
a heart condition.

287
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,600
Get up.

288
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,000
Put down
your fucking weapons!

289
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,400
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

290
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
- Don't move! Don't move! Come here!
- I haven't got...

291
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,100
- Come here, come here, come here!
- I work in the bank!

292
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,100
On your knees! Down on your knees now!

293
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,500
- They sent me out here!
- Now!

294
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,400
- He said stay away!
- Cuff him.

295
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,900
If you come near the bank,
he'll throw out two dead bodies!

296
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,900
- Who said this? Who?
- I don't know who!

297
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,400
The guy with the big fucking gun!

298
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,300
- That's who!
- All right, get on your feet. Let's go.

299
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,800
- There's four of them in there!
- Come on.

300
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,000
Christ!

301
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,400
- Calm down!
- Let's go!

302
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,700
- Am I gonna be on TV?
- Yeah. A big star. Let's go. Come on.

303
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,100
Was it a time when I thought
I might not see my family again? Yeah.

304
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,900
Yeah, I thought about it.
I mean, at first, I wasn't...

305
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,300
It was too much to think about at that point.

306
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,400
You know, with a gun in your face,
but after a while I...

307
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,800
You know, I thought about...

308
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,900
Yeah.

309
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,800
My wife, you know,
not seeing my wife again.

310
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,200
My kids. I got a 10-year-old son,
17-year-old daughter.

311
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,100
Yeah, I thought about it, man.
What do you think?

312
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,500
Those are my babies.

313
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,100
Beautiful.

314
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,300
Go ahead.

315
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,700
Miss White, I want you to rest assured

316
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,600
my only intention is to spend time
in your wonderful city

317
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,500
and to enjoy all that it has to offer.

318
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,000
And no business with your uncle?

319
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,200
In truth, I have very little
to do with him these days.

320
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,800
I'm told you haven't seen him in nine years.
Is that right?

321
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,400
- You are extremely well informed.
- I have to be. Yes?

322
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,500
I have a Mr Arthur Case
on the phone for you.

323
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,500
We'll need to end this here.

324
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,600
I'm gonna need
a copy of your purchase agreement,

325
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
your mortgage application,
and the other documentation,

326
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,000
- and I'll be in touch.
- Thank you, Miss White.

327
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,900
Right this way, sir.

328
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,700
Arthur Case? You sure?

329
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,900
- That's what he said.
- He said his name, just like that?

330
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,300
It wasn't his secretary
saying he was on the line?

331
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,300
- No, ma'am.
- All right. Put him through.

332
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,600
Okay.

333
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,700
- This is Madeleine White.
- Miss White, I'm Arthur Case.

334
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,400
Oh, good morning, Mr Case.

335
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,200
- Have we met formally?
- No, sir, I don't believe we have.

336
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,600
Yet, you're always turning up

337
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,000
at my July 4th parties in Southampton.

338
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Yes, we know some of the same people.

339
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,200
It seems.

340
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,500
I'll come right to the point.

341
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,800
I have a small problem
which requires someone

342
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,200
with very special skills
and complete discretion.

343
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Are you such a person
or have I been misinformed?

344
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,000
Go on.

345
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,700
Can I pick you up in front of
your office building in five minutes?

346
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,100
- I'll be downstairs.
- Thank you.

347
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,100
They had a kind of genius plan

348
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,700
for throwing us out of whack

349
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,100
and depriving us
of any kind of way of controlling ourselves.

350
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
They were... They were very

351
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,900
insistent, and yet, strangely detached.

352
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,800
All I know is that they called each other
a variation of Steve.

353
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,100
Steven, Steve-O, Stevie.

354
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,400
And they called you what?

355
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,500
They didn't call me anything.
They just told me...

356
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,700
You're lying to me. Tell me the truth, now.
You're lying to me.

357
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,600
Tell me the...
Look at me and tell me the truth.

358
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,300
They had AK-47 s out. Four of them.

359
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,100
- You know a lot about guns.
- No.

360
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,100
- I don't know anything about guns, except...
- But you know they had an AK-47.

361
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,300
- Everybody knows what an AK-47 is.
- Everybody?

362
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,200
Anybody who's ever watched
a decent action movie would.

363
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,000
- You ever rob a bank before?
- Are you kidding?

364
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,800
Me rob a bank? No.

365
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,000
- Never stole a dollar?
- Never.

366
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,400
- Never?
- Not ever.

367
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,500
- You know what?
- That one time. That one time, that one time.

368
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,000
I stole a nickel
from my grandmother's pocketbook once.

369
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,300
She was Polish.

370
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,100
I used to go up to her and say,
"Mama, toh nicklah, toh nicklah. "

371
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,300
One day, I opened her pocketbook
and there was a nickel.

372
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,800
I took it.

373
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,300
That was the only thing I ever took.

374
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,000
Look, Detective, I didn't mean
to give you a hard time back there.

375
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Forget about it. What's the story, Captain?

376
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,000
Well, the hostage they let go
was Herman Gluck, 73.

377
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,500
He was having chest pains.
Paramedics have him.

378
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,000
They told him to say
that if any cops came near the door,

379
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,500
they'd throw out two dead bodies.

380
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,400
He thinks there's four perps.
Says they came in dressed as painters.

381
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,900
There's a video system in the bank.

382
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,900
We're working on getting a download

383
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,300
from Manhattan Trust's
central security office, but it'll take a while.

384
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,800
We got the block locked up.
I got men in the windows.

385
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,500
We're checking on the sewers with D.E.P.

386
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,100
What about the phones?

387
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,900
Cut and diverted into M.C.C.
We're the only ones they're gonna call.

388
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,700
Cell phones are monitored
and we can jam the air whenever you say.

389
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,100
But we like to leave it clear
in case a hostage is able to get through,

390
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,300
but so far nothing.

391
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,300
-911?
- It's up on the screen.

392
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,400
Any call about a bank
gets routed straight to us.

393
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,300
Well, that's my end of it, Detective.

394
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,700
Yeah.

395
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,700
Yeah, I'm not calling them yet.

396
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,300
Beg your pardon?

397
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,600
Doesn't feel right yet,
you know what I mean?

398
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,600
I'm not gonna call him
and ask what I can do for him.

399
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,500
Let's see what he does.

400
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,000
Your call.

401
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,700
Now, Mr Case, why don't you
let me explain to you how I work?

402
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,700
Please. That would be nice.

403
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,700
Well, you say that there are family heirlooms
inside your safety deposit box.

404
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,300
That's fine.

405
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,900
But in my experience, people like you
have people working for them

406
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,600
that handle these kinds of things.

407
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,600
And when they can't,
well, they don't call me.

408
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,500
Their people call me.

409
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,700
So, immediately, I know
that there's something in that box

410
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,100
that you don't even want
your closest aides to know about.

411
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,600
No problem with me.

412
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,700
You tell me I don't need to know
what's in that box and I don't need to know.

413
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,700
But if you tell me
that it's a bunch of old baseball cards

414
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,700
and I find out that it's the launch codes
for a nuclear missile,

415
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,500
then let's just say
we no longer have an agreement.

416
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,700
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

417
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
What's inside that box, young lady,

418
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,700
has belonged to me
since before you were born.

419
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,000
It's very valuable
and poses no danger whatsoever to anyone.

420
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,900
Except you.

421
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,600
Okay. Well, first,
there are men with guns in there,

422
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,500
so I can't guarantee any results. Agreed?

423
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,300
- Of course.
- All right.

424
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,300
Now, what makes you think
that they want to rob your box?

425
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,700
I don't.

426
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,400
Well, why don't you tell me
how you would like this to end?

427
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,900
I'd prefer that nobody
ever touch my safe deposit box.

428
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,000
Not them, not you, not the authorities.

429
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,000
And the sooner this situation ends,
the happier I'll be.

430
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,700
- Is that specific enough for you?
- No.

431
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,400
The contents of that box

432
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,600
are of great value to me.

433
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,100
So long as they remain my secret.

434
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,100
And if they're exposed?

435
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,000
I'll face some difficult questions.

436
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,400
- So, it stays locked or it disappears.
- Precisely.

437
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,700
- Can you make that happen?
- Yes.

438
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,100
I hope so.
I have to say, I can't help but be sceptical.

439
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,200
Whoever gave you my number
got the same deal.

440
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,100
Clearly, they must have been satisfied.

441
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,100
Steve?

442
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,400
It's time for Steve-O.

443
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,200
I came out here to take a look
at the perimeter they laid down.

444
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,700
Guess what I found?

445
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,100
That hostage they let out said these guys
came in dressed like painters, right?

446
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Yeah.

447
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,300
Probably stolen.

448
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,800
Have them run it and check it for prints.

449
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,200
- Everybody on?
- Yep, I'm there.

450
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,300
- Sure you got the right number?
- Absolutely.

451
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,400
Okay. Nothing yet.

452
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,400
We got video.

453
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,900
Let's have it.

454
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,600
What happened to that camera
right there?

455
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,000
Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

456
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,600
Yeah, there it is.
That guy right there.

457
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,900
It's like he blinds the camera
with the flashlight.

458
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,600
It's weird, isn't it?
It's like nobody else sees it.

459
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,400
- You'd think it'd be pretty bright, huh?
- It could be infrared.

460
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
- What's that?
- Infrared bulb.

461
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,700
See, humans can't see it,
but a video camera will pick it up.

462
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,800
He could knock out the cameras
without no one knowing.

463
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,100
Right, right, right, right.

464
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,000
He knocked out
the cameras about 10:00.

465
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,300
So, for approximately two minutes,

466
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,900
we got no evidence of people
leaving or entering the bank. That's great.

467
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,100
Miriam, how long were you there
before it began?

468
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,700
It was just a few minutes.

469
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,900
Well, can you tell us what happened
after the explosions and the smoke?

470
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,200
They just told us to put our heads down.
And then close our eyes.

471
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,400
And then I just remember one of them

472
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,200
telling the others to just go down
and fix the cameras.

473
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,200
- The video cameras?
- I don't know.

474
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,300
Anything else you want to share with us?

475
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,500
No, just...

476
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,400
- You sure?
- Yeah, I...

477
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Could you give us
the names of the bank robbers, maybe?

478
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,600
I'm just messing with you, sweetheart.

479
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,100
- You okay?
- Thank you.

480
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,200
Okay.

481
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,300
- It was pretty awful.
- Was it bad?

482
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,500
I mean, they made us strip.

483
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,600
They made us take off our clothes.

484
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,000
I don't understand why they had to do that.

485
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,600
I really just thought...

486
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,000
I thought I was gonna be killed.

487
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,900
Well.

488
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,100
- All right, my dear.
- Okay.

489
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,600
- I can go?
- No.

490
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,400
- No?
- No, you got to stay.

491
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,900
- You got to stay.
- No, you can go.

492
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,200
No, stay. No, go.

493
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,900
Did you rob the bank?

494
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,200
- You did.
- Did you rob the bank?

495
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,500
- No.
- You sure?

496
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,500
There's movement at the front door.
- Let's go.

497
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,900
Put down the fucking weapon!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

498
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,900
Don't move! Don't move!

499
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,200
He's got a device on him there.

500
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,600
I said put your hands on your head
and get down on your fucking knees!

501
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,400
I said put your hands on your head
and down on your knees now!

502
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,000
Hands are tied!
Hands are tied.

503
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,100
- Jesus, pat him down.
- All right.

504
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,100
I'm one of the hostages!
- Careful.

505
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,600
Easy, be very careful,
now. Easy.

506
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,000
I can't see him from where I'm at.

507
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,000
I can see him. I got a clear shot.
Any weapons?

508
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,500
- Who are you?
- Vikram Walia. I work in the bank.

509
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Okay. Vikram? Is this a bomb?

510
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,000
- Oh, shit! A fucking Arab!
- What? No. I'm a Sikh!

511
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,300
- Is that a bomb?
- No.

512
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,500
- Answer me, Vikram. Is this a bomb?
- No.

513
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,000
- Are you booby-trapped?
- No, fuck, no.

514
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,700
Okay, Vikram, I need you to relax.

515
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,300
- Jesus, give me a hand.
- I don't know.

516
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,500
Just watch.
There's a lot of movement in that bank.

517
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,000
- Team, take him down.
- Mike, now, get him.

518
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,600
What the fuck? Easy, easy.

519
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,400
Get off my... That's my turban. Get off. Easy.

520
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,800
Get... My turban!
Look, fuck, give my turban back!

521
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,300
Come on, shut up. Relax.

522
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,300
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me my turban back.

523
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,100
- You can't fucking rip my turban.
- Shut up, already.

524
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,300
- What the fuck?
- Come on, move it.

525
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Get your fucking hands off me!

526
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,500
And the 11:00 and 12:00...

527
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,500
And don't forget about your 1:00
with Chancellor Joel Klein.

528
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,100
- Oh, Madge. What a day...
- Your Honour.

529
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,900
Madeleine! How are you?

530
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,400
I'm just fine, but thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

531
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,700
- Sure. Madge, are we through here?
- Yes, Mr Mayor.

532
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,900
This way, Miss White.

533
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,800
I always have time to put on a tux
and eat free food for a good cause.

534
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,800
Who are we saving this week?

535
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,600
Well, I'm doing a round of support

536
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,500
for the Joseph Freidkin Memorial Fund
for Spinal Cord Research

537
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,700
and we're having
our annual fundraiser next month.

538
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,700
If you could attend,
it would give us such a boost.

539
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,700
It would be my pleasure.
Is there anything else I can do to...

540
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,800
- What the fuck do you want?
- A favour.

541
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,700
- No shit. Which kind?
- The last one I'll ever ask of you.

542
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,500
That's the kind I had in mind.

543
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,200
You know about this hostage situation.

544
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,500
On my way. What's it to do with you?

545
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,700
All right, well, I need to keep an eye on it.

546
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,700
So, I want you to bring me down there
and tell whoever's in charge

547
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,800
to extend me every courtesy.

548
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,000
You're out of your fucking mind.

549
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,400
If it was easy,
it wouldn't square us, would it?

550
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,700
- It's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

551
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You just have to call in a few markers,
that's all.

552
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,300
I may have to give out a few.

553
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,400
Then that's exactly what you'll do.

554
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
You're a magnificent cunt.

555
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,600
Thank you.

556
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,600
It's been a very tense situation
for several hours now.

557
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,000
It's unclear how many hostages are inside

558
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,500
and how many robbers
police are dealing with.

559
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,800
Officials say this all started out
as a robbery at Manhattan Trust,

560
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,800
but has turned into this hostage situation.

561
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,700
Negotiators are here on the scene,
working very hard

562
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,400
and it's still unclear
on any possible injuries.

563
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,700
Of course, we'll keep you up to date
with the very latest

564
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,700
and we will remain here on the scene
as this all unfolds.

565
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,700
That's the latest from here
in lower Manhattan.

566
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,600
Reporting live, I'm Sandra Endo.
Back to you.

567
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,600
"Protect and serve" my ass.
Where's my turban?

568
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,100
I'm not talking to anybody without a turban.

569
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,200
It's part of my religion, to cover my head
in respect to God. I'm a Sikh.

570
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,700
Okay, we'll find your turban.

571
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,000
Not an Arab, by the way,
like your cops called me outside.

572
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,100
Now, no, I don't think you heard that.

573
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,500
There was a lot going on.
You were probably disoriented.

574
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,600
- I didn't hear that.
- I heard what I heard.

575
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,700
I'll give you all the information you want.

576
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,700
I don't need this. I need my turban.
It's part of my religion.

577
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,800
- We'll get you your turban.
- We'll find it for you.

578
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,300
No, no, no. Not "get me. "
I want my turban now.

579
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,100
You just got to start thinking
about the people inside the bank now.

580
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,300
It's a dangerous situation.

581
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,800
You got to start telling us
about what's going on inside the bank.

582
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,300
We can talk about this later.
We'll get an officer to come down.

583
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,900
You can write a formal complaint.

584
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,300
But for now,
we got to deal with this situation.

585
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,400
First you beat me,
and now you want my help.

586
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,100
You need to start thinking
about your coworkers.

587
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,700
I could apologise on behalf of the NYPD,
but that was not us. We are detectives.

588
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
- We're gonna try and find out...
- What do you want to know?

589
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,700
- How many were there?
- I think there were about four.

590
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,400
- How many hostages?
- I don't know how many hostages, 20, 30.

591
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,800
I'm fucking tired of this shit.
What happened to my fucking civil rights?

592
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,800
Why can't I go anywhere
without being harassed?

593
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,100
I get thrown out of a bank.
I'm a hostage. I get harassed.

594
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,400
I go to the airport.

595
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,100
I can't go through security
without a "random" selection.

596
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,100
Fucking random, my ass.
I nearly lost my job...

597
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,500
I bet you can get a cab, though.

598
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,500
I guess that's one of the perks.

599
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,100
Put the ice on your face.

600
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,700
"Two buses with full gas tanks.
One jumbo jet with full gas tank

601
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,500
"and pilots at JFK,
parked at the end of runway. "

602
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,300
They give us until 9.:00 pm to do this,

603
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,900
then they kill one hostage every hour
in front of TV cameras.

604
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,400
"Bank is secured with Semtex.
We will demonstrate if necessary. "

605
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,300
- Whatever you do, don't give them a jet.
- There's no plane. Maybe a bus. Maybe.

606
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,100
Till I talk to them, they get nothing.
Not even a cup of coffee.

607
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,300
For now, we wait.

608
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,700
Let's let them wonder
what we're doing, okay?

609
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,100
Excuse me, Detectives. This is Arthur Case.

610
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,700
- He's the...
- I'm Chairman, Board of Directors.

611
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,900
- Of the bank. You wanna talk to him?
- Absolutely.

612
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,700
Mr Case, how are you?
I'm Detective Frazier.

613
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,200
Anything in particular
you think we should know?

614
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,200
No. I just wondered
if I might be of some assistance.

615
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,300
- Have they made any demands?
- They want a jet.

616
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,700
Oh, I see.

617
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,600
Would you like me to arrange one for you?

618
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,600
I'm so sorry. I must have misunderstood.

619
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,100
That's quite all right, Mr Case.

620
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,500
Where can we reach you
if we need anything?

621
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,500
Well, those are my people in there,
you know,

622
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,400
and I would like to stay here for a while.
And I won't disturb you.

623
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,500
I'll be very quiet right down...
Sergeant Collins!

624
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,800
Mr Case, we'll try and keep you posted
as best we can,

625
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,000
but you're gonna have to excuse us
for now, okay?

626
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,600
Right this way, sir.
Thank you very much.

627
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,900
- Absolutely.
- This way, sir.

628
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,600
Thank you very much.
- And thank you all so much.

629
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

630
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,700
This way, sir.

631
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,500
"Fifty hungry people need food now. "

632
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
All right.
Are we ready with the listening devices?

633
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,400
I'm gonna need 15 minutes
once we get the food.

634
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,400
Pizza's the best. No sandwiches.

635
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,500
Is she for real?
Are you for real?

636
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,800
Well, if we send in, say,
10 pizzas boxes with transmitters,

637
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,600
maybe we'll get some conversation
if we give them something to group around.

638
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,700
Give them each a sandwich, it's hit or miss.

639
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,400
They can move around
and I don't have 50 transmitters.

640
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,700
- What's this?
- It's a digital recorder.

641
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,800
You click it, and it'll record for half an hour.

642
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,300
- James Bond shit.
- Well, you can get them on Amazon.

643
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,900
- You gonna ask for a hostage?
- He already gave us one, didn't he?

644
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,100
I ask for another one,
he says no, then what?

645
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,000
No, he knows what he's doing.

646
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,000
He gave us a hostage.
We'll give him some food.

647
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,800
I don't want to get caught bluffing this guy.

648
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,700
Fuck this shit. Look, they want to shoot me
for taking off my mask, they can go ahead.

649
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,500
Do you wanna get us all killed?

650
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,600
You wanna relax?
What the hell is the difference?

651
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,500
They're out there robbing the bank!

652
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,200
- Can't you see they fucked him up?
- Shut up.

653
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,200
You think they dressed us like this for fun,
puneta?

654
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,700
- I have no idea
- Please shut up.

655
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,000
...why they made us put on all of this crap.

656
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,000
Probably so when the cops break in
and try to rescue us

657
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,300
- we all get fucking shot.
- Oh, my God!

658
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,600
It's a great plan, but, no, thanks.

659
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I told you to shut up! Leave him!

660
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,800
No! Don't do this to me! Please, don't.

661
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,200
I'll do as you say! No! Help! Help!

662
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,800
Please, don't! Don't!

663
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,300
One guy did most of the talking.

664
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,800
He told everyone else what to do.

665
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,600
- So they were talking amongst themselves?
- We couldn't hear them.

666
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,200
They had us in these rooms.

667
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,000
The doors were locked all the time.

668
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,100
We didn't know what they were doing.

669
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,900
- Did you hear anything they said?
- I have problems with my hearing.

670
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,800
- I see.
- I wear hearing aids.

671
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,600
- Where are they?
- They're in my ears.

672
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,900
- Let's see.
- Let me see them.

673
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,500
- Yeah, let's take a look at them.
- Yeah, it's a hearing aid.

674
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:55,900
That's your other one, there?

675
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,900
What's the red part, there?
What does that do?

676
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,500
They're different colours.
You need two different...

677
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,500
And to distinguish right from left, also.

678
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,100
- Distinguish right from left?
- Yeah.

679
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,700
Right from wrong.

680
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,200
I don't understand.

681
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,600
- Steve?
- I'm sorry?

682
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,100
- I didn't say anything.
- Oh.

683
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,000
Steve. Is that your name? Steve?

684
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,700
Stevie? Steve-O?

685
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,400
- How much are they gonna pay you?
- I'm sorry?

686
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,000
- You heard me.
- No, I didn't.

687
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,900
- How much are they going to pay you?
- Who's gonna pay me?

688
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,000
- Were you involved in this robbery?
- Absolutely not.

689
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,400
Were you involved in this situation?

690
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,800
- What situation?
- Don't lie. Don't lie.

691
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,000
If he gives us a tip, I'm keeping it.

692
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,000
- Put that gun down!
- Check that weapon!

693
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,100
All right, everybody, relax.
Calm down. Calm down.

694
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,000
Calm the fuck down!

695
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,200
How you doing?

696
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,900
I'm Detective Keith Frazier,
Hostage Negotiation Team.

697
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,000
How's it going?

698
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,300
Okay. I hope the pizzas are okay.
They might be a little cold.

699
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,100
Listen, you pick up the phone
anytime you want.

700
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,700
It's a direct line to me.

701
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,700
I would love to talk to you.

702
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,600
Nice talking to you.

703
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,900
Shit. Fucking Russians.

704
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,200
Call Operations. See if they can get
a Russian translator over here ASAP.

705
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,100
And get some fucking body bags.

706
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,000
I hope you know what you're doing.

707
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,800
Because if my guys got to shoot it out
with those fucking savages...

708
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,700
Okay, okay, okay. Mitch?

709
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,800
Check with either one of the hostages.

710
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,000
Find out if they heard any Russian
or Russian accents when they were in there.

711
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,700
We'll be all right.

712
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,000
No!

713
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,400
Down on the floor!

714
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,400
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go. Let's go.

715
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,000
Stop crying! Shut the fuck up!

716
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,100
Get in there! Sit down! Put your masks on!

717
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,200
Come on, let's go. Come on, boobs.

718
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,900
- "Boobs"? Who the fuck you talking to?
- Let's go. You heard me! Shut the fuck up!

719
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,400
- Why?
- Move that fat ass! Let's go! Come on!

720
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,800
"Fat ass"? Are you kidding me?

721
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,600
If you don't shut the fuck up,
I'm gonna put my foot up your fat ass!

722
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Put your masks on!

723
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,100
Put your hands on the ground!

724
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,700
Okay, okay.

725
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,700
On the floor. Hands are on the floor.

726
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,000
Masks on!

727
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,500
Put your hands on the ground!

728
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,400
Come on, boobs, let's go.

729
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,800
Oh, shit. Sit down! Sit down!

730
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,200
She was on line in front of me.

731
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,000
He was the teller on my line.

732
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,800
This guy was to my right
and his kid was in front of him.

733
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,100
He was playing with a video game.

734
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,700
I remember her.

735
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,100
- Why do you remember her?
- Great tits.

736
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,900
- You remember seeing any of them after?
- Yeah, I saw her one time afterwards.

737
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,700
- How are you sure you saw her again?
- I could see under the suit.

738
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,800
Can't hide quality like that.

739
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,300
This guy, he almost got us all killed.

740
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,500
How?

741
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,100
They put eight or nine of us
in an office for a while.

742
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:32,100
This guy took off his mask
and was talking like he wasn't afraid.

743
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,800
"I don't have to wear this damn mask,"
you know?

744
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,900
So, they come in, pull him out of the room
and smack him around a little.

745
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,200
- You see him again after that?
- No.

746
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,000
- Was he okay?
- Seemed fine.

747
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,400
You...

748
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,300
- You recognise anyone else from that room?
- I can't be sure about the others.

749
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,800
No one?

750
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,200
- Why don't you keep looking?
- You know, I was terrified.

751
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,700
What about before it began?

752
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,100
You didn't look around
while you were waiting in line?

753
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,900
I was talking to my girlfriend on the phone.

754
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,500
You wanna take another picture?

755
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,100
I could bend over and pick up a pencil.

756
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,000
Whatever.

757
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,000
This guy.

758
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,200
Asshole.

759
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,000
What the fuck? This ain't Russian.

760
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,300
No? What the hell is it?

761
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,000
It's not Polish. Not Hungarian.

762
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,500
Bulgarian, maybe.

763
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,500
It's Central European. Sort of.

764
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,000
That's it?
I mean, you're the language expert.

765
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,600
What? No.

766
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,400
- What do you think?
- Well, okay.

767
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,200
Well, this is New York City.

768
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,200
Somebody on the street
must know what it is.

769
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,600
Probably the hot-dog man.

770
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,600
Berk, play that over the speaker for me.
Excuse me.

771
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,500
Excuse me!

772
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,300
Does anybody know
what language they're speaking? Anybody?

773
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,900
Yo, my man.

774
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,400
Hey, Phil, let that guy through. Come on.

775
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,900
- You know what language they're speaking?
- Yeah, they're speaking Albanian.

776
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,400
- Albanian?
- Albanian. From Albania.

777
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,600
What am I doing here?

778
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,800
Yo, am I getting arrested for something?

779
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,800
No, you're not getting arrested.
Come on. Come on.

780
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,700
Whoa.

781
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,700
- Okay. What are they saying?
- I have no idea what they're saying.

782
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,600
You got no idea?
I thought you said you spoke Albanian.

783
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,900
No. I never said I speak Albanian.

784
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,100
You said you spoke Albanian.

785
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,300
I never said I speak Albanian.

786
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,800
Well, how do you know it's Albanian?

787
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,900
My ex-wife and her parents are Albanian.

788
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,400
Her parents couldn't speak English for shit.

789
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,900
I have no idea what they're saying,

790
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,600
but I'll tell you right now
that the language is 100%% Albanian.

791
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,300
-100%%?
-100%%.

792
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,100
Call the Albanian Consulate.
See if they can get somebody over here

793
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,100
to translate this for us. Make it happen fast.

794
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,700
Okay, you hang out
in the back for me, okay?

795
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,400
Oh, man, not again.

796
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,500
Van was stolen two days ago, but it's clean.
No prints.

797
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,100
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

798
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,300
Albanian?

799
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,500
My man, like I told you, 100%% Albanian.

800
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,200
Undeniable.

801
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,400
- Hey.
- Thanks.

802
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,300
Yo, yo, yo.
There go that motherfucker right there.

803
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,900
Hey, yo, you thought you was gonna
get away with that shit, didn't you?

804
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,600
How does this game work?

805
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,600
You get points for doing dirt,
like jacking a car or selling crack.

806
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,500
And you lose points
if someone jacks your ride or shoots you.

807
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,500
Come on, baby.

808
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,100
Take that! Take this! What? What? What?

809
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,200
Talk shit now! I don't hear you!

810
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,800
Eat this! Eat that! Eat this! Eat that!

811
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,300
You're gone, baby! You're dead! Bye-bye!

812
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,700
Jesus!

813
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,100
What's the point of this?

814
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,600
Like my man 50 says,
"Get rich or die tryin'."

815
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,400
Yo, you'd get mad points
for knocking over the bank.

816
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,400
- You think that's cool?
- Hell, yeah. You trying to get paid, too.

817
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,500
Finish your slice.
I'll take you back to your father.

818
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,300
I got to talk to him about this game.

819
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,500
- Is it good?
- No doubt.

820
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,600
It's gonna be okay.

821
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,700
Cool.

822
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,800
You'll be home soon.

823
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,900
That's whassup.

824
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,500
- Sir?
- Yeah.

825
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,600
- No luck with the Albanian Consulate.
- What do you mean?

826
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,100
I couldn't tell what the guy
was talking about. I think he wanted money.

827
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,300
And I tried the State Department.
That takes a month.

828
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,500
Okay.

829
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,700
- Call her.
- Are you crazy?

830
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,200
- I hate that bitch. Come on.
- You said she speaks Albanian, right?

831
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,500
- Yeah, she was born there.
- Call her.

832
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,300
I'm gonna regret this.

833
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,900
- Who's Detective Frazier?
- Right here.

834
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,600
- I have llina Maria over here.
- Miritia.

835
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,100
- Oh, how you doing?
- Hello.

836
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,500
How you doing?

837
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,100
- What's this?
- Parking tickets. You can fix them?

838
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,300
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

839
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,200
Can you listen to this
and tell us what they're saying?

840
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,100
You can't smoke in here.

841
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,500
Shit. Go ahead.

842
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,600
What's so funny?
What, you know what they're talking about?

843
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,700
I know what they're talking about.
I even know who it is.

844
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,900
You know who it is?
You mean you know their names?

845
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,800
- Who? I mean, who is it?
- Parking tickets?

846
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,400
- They're taken care of. Who is it?
- It's Enver Hoxha.

847
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,200
- Who?
- He was the president of Albania.

848
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,800
Wait.

849
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,700
You're telling me the former president
of Albania is in there robbing a bank?

850
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,100
Enver Hoxha's dead.

851
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,200
That's a tape of him discussing
how Albanian people are great people.

852
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,000
They are immortal people. I wouldn't worry.

853
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,700
It's a tape. You're sure about that?

854
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I had to listen to all this nonsense
in school.

855
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,300
"Communism is great. Capitalism is evil.
Lenin, Marx, blah, blah, blah. "

856
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,400
It's Enver Hoxha. It's a tape.

857
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,200
Okay. Okay, well,
Officer, you can take her home.

858
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,800
And do me a favour, huh?
Watch where you park next time, okay?

859
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,500
So, they're playing tapes for us now.

860
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,000
They knew we were gonna bug them.

861
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,700
Yeah, you're damn right they knew we were
gonna bug them. And they knew how.

862
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,800
What makes it even worse,
they wanted us to bug them

863
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,400
so they could send us
on a wild goose chase.

864
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,300
Last time I had my johnson
pulled that good, it cost me $5.

865
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,500
$5?

866
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,300
Yeah, Tijuana. Don't ask.

867
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,300
Look at the... Oh, fuck that.

868
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,000
- Detective Frazier. Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

869
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,400
This is Madeleine White.

870
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,900
- How do you do, Miss White?
- It's an honour, Detective.

871
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,600
Miss White may be able to assist you.

872
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,700
Good. Good. What do you have in mind?

873
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:28,400
She has a certain amount of influence
in these matters

874
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:31,200
for reasons which I can't share with you.

875
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,000
What are you trying to say, sir?

876
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,100
What the Mayor means
is that there are matters at stake here

877
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,100
that are a little bit above your pay grade.
No offence.

878
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,300
And he's offering to help you.

879
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:48,100
Well, why don't you just tell the Mayor
to raise my pay grade to the proper level

880
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,700
and problem solved.

881
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,100
From what I hear, that would have happened
a long time ago

882
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,400
if you'd been a little bit more diplomatic.
But we can certainly discuss it.

883
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,600
Look, I'm kidding. I mean,
I make First Grade when I make First Grade.

884
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,500
You want to speed that up,
I'm not gonna talk you out of it.

885
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,900
Then there's also the matter of $140,000
that seems to have walked away

886
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,000
from the Madrugada cheque-cashing bust.

887
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,200
Oh, I see.

888
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,100
Well, I had nothing to do with that.

889
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,200
Yeah, Collins, we got snipers
in the windows here.

890
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,000
We got guys in the building next door.
Guys up on the roof.

891
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,200
We're trying to get the blueprints
for the bank

892
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,000
so we can figure out the ventilator shaft.
Maybe we can come down.

893
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,800
Well?
Is this the President of Albania?

894
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,900
- Speaking.
- Pretty funny.

895
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,200
- You shouldn't eavesdrop on people.
- Well, you better get used to it, pal.

896
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,300
There's not gonna be much privacy
where you're going.

897
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,600
You're damn right.

898
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:41,600
This time next week,
I'll be sucking down piña coladas

899
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,800
in a hot tub with six girls
named Amber and Tiffany.

900
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
More like taking a shower with two guys
named Jamal and Jesus,

901
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,600
if you know what I mean.
And here's the bad news,

902
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,800
that thing you're sucking on,
it's not a piña colada.

903
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,200
- Maybe you like that kind of thing, huh?
- You really want to piss me off.

904
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,700
All right, here's where we stand.

905
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,500
I don't need
your fucking status report, Serpico.

906
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,200
I tell you where things stand.

907
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,600
- Sure, sure. I just meant...
- Here's where things stand.

908
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,500
You're getting me what I asked you for.

909
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,500
You'll have it ready in the time I gave you

910
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,800
or you'll sit by and you'll watch me do
just what I said I would do. Clear?

911
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,800
Very clear.
I'm trying to get you what you want.

912
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,700
But you got to understand this.

913
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,500
You know, it's not like the City of New York
has 747 s waiting around for days like today.

914
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,100
I understand that if you don't get
my plane ready,

915
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,500
- then you might as well send a hearse.
- Please.

916
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,000
Let's focus on how we can both
get what we want, all right?

917
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,500
Hey! You're not listening.

918
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:39,000
You get me what I want, I won't kill anyone.

919
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,600
All right. I'm on it. I'm on it.

920
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,700
Let's just try to keep everybody calm, okay?

921
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,500
- Don't I sound calm to you?
- Yeah, you do.

922
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,800
Yeah, you do.

923
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,700
- So, Mr Damerjian...
- Damerjian.

924
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,800
- Damerjian. Is that Albanian?
- Just call me Kenneth.

925
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,200
- Kenneth?
- Is that Albanian or...

926
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,800
It's Armenian.

927
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,200
What's the difference?

928
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,700
Detective, I was born in Queens.

929
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,900
I've never been to Armenia, Albania.
I went surfing in Australia once.

930
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,600
Can I have a glass of water?

931
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,000
- Are you thirsty?
- My throat's parched.

932
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,700
- I'm not nervous.
- Your throat's parched?

933
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,500
- My throat's parched.
- His throat is parched.

934
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,100
- I just want a glass of water.
- Oh, shit!

935
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,500
When you start telling us
what really happened...

936
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,500
- I just want a glass of water.
- His throat is parched.

937
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,200
- Here. You want some coffee?
- No, that's all right.

938
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,600
- I don't drink that stuff.
- No, go ahead.

939
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,800
Did you know they were robbing the bank?

940
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,100
I didn't know they were robbing the bank
until they pulled a gun in my face.

941
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,700
Is that why you held the door open
for them?

942
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,800
How do you know they robbed the bank?

943
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,300
Because they pulled a gun in my face...

944
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,700
That doesn't mean they were
robbing the bank.

945
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,400
Did they take money?
Did you see them take money?

946
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,000
I was in a bank and I was locked up
for who knows how long.

947
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,800
- Okay.
- Tied up in a room. I saw you see me.

948
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,300
You saw me see you?

949
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,800
- Is that what you just said?
- Yeah.

950
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,200
I was locked up in the room.
You saw me gagged when you came in.

951
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,900
Listen, I can't work miracles over here.
I'm gonna need more time.

952
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,800
Well, perhaps if you'd use the time
that I gave you more efficiently,

953
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,400
you wouldn't be having this problem.

954
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,600
- What do you want me to say?
- That my plane is ready.

955
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,400
Okay, listen.

956
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:01,200
I promise you, as God is my witness,
I'm working on it as hard as I can.

957
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,100
It's just gonna take a few more hours.

958
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,600
Why should I give you any more time?

959
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,000
Well, it's simple. You give me more time,
you get what you want.

960
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,200
You don't give me the time,
you don't get what you want.

961
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,900
You got nothing to lose.

962
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,800
Meanwhile, we'll send in some more food.

963
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,700
I got a question for you.
You get it right, I give you more time.

964
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,300
- And?
- You know what happens if you don't.

965
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,900
Which weighs more?

966
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,700
All the trains that pass through
Grand Central Station in a year,

967
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,000
or the trees cut down to print
all US currency in circulation?

968
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,000
Here's a hint. It's a trick question.

969
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,200
What the hell is that? Playing games now?

970
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,600
It's the trains.

971
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:46,600
US money isn't printed on paper at all.
It's cotton.

972
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,400
- Yeah, I heard that.
- Yeah, that's right.

973
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,800
- Okay.
- So no trees were cut down.

974
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,300
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. 100%%.

975
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:53,700
Okay.

976
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,000
I got it.

977
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,000
- Wait a second. Wait a second.
- I'll call you back.

978
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,200
It's a trap. They both weigh the same.

979
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,700
Tell him they both weigh the same.
They both weigh nothing.

980
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,800
They both weigh nothing
or they both weigh the same?

981
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,000
Tell him they both weigh the same.

982
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,700
Tell him they both weigh the same.
Do it now.

983
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,000
They both weigh the same. Got it.

984
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,300
- Well?
- They both weigh the same.

985
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,300
This time, send sandwiches.

986
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,200
That's pretty good. This guy's nuts.

987
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,700
He said, "Grand Central Station. "

988
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,600
Grand Central Terminal is the train station.

989
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,300
- Grand Central Station is the post office.
- Is the post office.

990
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,700
He's wrong.
Who's wrong?

991
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,900
Perp One.
Trains don't pass through Grand Central.

992
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,100
It's the last stop for every train.

993
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,000
- What about the subway? They run through.
- Metro-North goes there.

994
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,000
- How the fuck do you know?
- Metro-North goes there!

995
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,600
No. Metro-North starts there.

996
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,700
What are you guys talking about?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

997
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:58,100
- Metro-North goes through!
- Let's just get the sandwiches.

998
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:02,000
- Metro-North...
- Deal is, he said, "Passes through. "

999
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,200
Yeah, but the Metro-North goes up
there, though.

1000
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,700
Look, shut up. It doesn't matter, anyway.

1001
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,100
I know what he meant.

1002
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,800
What he said is one thing,
but what he meant is another.

1003
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,200
Yeah.
That's always a problem, isn't it?

1004
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,400
Sandwiches.

1005
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,100
I'm on it, I'm on it.

1006
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,300
You know, right now I could go for
a nice kosher hot dog and a beer.

1007
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,500
I had Met tickets tonight.
And Pedro's pitching!

1008
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:23,400
They're gonna get their asses
kicked anyway.

1009
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,100
Tell me about it. I'm better off here.
I'm glad they didn't separate us.

1010
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,900
- Do you think they're terrorists?
- They're robbers, not terrorists.

1011
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,700
How do you know? They could be Al-Qaeda.

1012
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,600
Trust me. I've studied these things.

1013
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,500
- What are you, Mossad?
- No. I was a lawyer.

1014
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,600
Now I teach courses at Columbia Law
on genocide, slave labour,

1015
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,500
- war reparation claims.
- Mira.

1016
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:43,000
- Can I sue anybody when this is over?
- Oh, sure. Go nuts.

1017
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,700
Go meshuga.

1018
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,800
Now that's a good looking shithole.

1019
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,600
- Hello?
Hey, baby, how you doing?

1020
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,700
Baby, I'm worried about you.
You coming home?

1021
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soon.

1022
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,800
It's gonna be a long night, though,
so don't wait up for me.

1023
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,500
Why don't you let me come down there?

1024
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,100
Because I don't want to be
distracted by you, that's why.

1025
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:15,400
Well, if you're still there when I come
on duty in the morning, you will see me.

1026
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,600
- I cannot wait. I cannot wait.
- So, how you doing?

1027
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,700
It's all right. We got a couple
of the hostages out. Thanks a lot.

1028
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,200
- No, no. How you doing?
- I'm doing okay. I'm doing all right.

1029
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,900
Oh, I saw the Mayor on TV. He said
you're doing a great job. I saw you, too.

1030
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,800
- You saw me on TV?
- Yeah.

1031
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:33,300
- How'd I look?
- You looked good, baby. Real good.

1032
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,300
- All right, listen. I got to go.
- All right. Hey.

1033
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,500
- Keep your head down.
- All right, I will. Love you.

1034
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,000
Come on.

1035
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,300
So, are we clear about the ground rules?

1036
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,800
- There's no need to worry, Detective.
- I get paid to worry, okay?

1037
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,600
I just need you to look me in the eye

1038
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,300
and make me believe that you understand
everything we talked about.

1039
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,900
- I understand.
- Okay.

1040
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,300
Someone here wants to talk to you.

1041
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,100
- Hello?
- Who is this?

1042
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,200
Let's not get into any names.

1043
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,700
- What matters is what I can offer you.
- And what's that?

1044
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,300
Well, if I can be assured
that certain interests are protected,

1045
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,600
I might be able to help you get
what you came for.

1046
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,900
I doubt that.

1047
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:24,000
Tell me about these interests
that you are trying to protect.

1048
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,800
Why don't you let me worry about that?

1049
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:29,300
Now, what is it you were hoping to get out
of all this?

1050
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,600
- Rich, of course.
- Of course.

1051
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,100
But you may have bitten off
more than you can chew.

1052
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:37,000
- How?
- I can't discuss that on the phone.

1053
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,300
- You work for the bank?
- No.

1054
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,600
And you're not a cop.

1055
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,400
That's right.

1056
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,500
Come on in.

1057
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,300
You got 10 minutes. No more.

1058
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,000
If you're not out
before the lights come back on,

1059
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,700
you can stay inside until this thing is over.

1060
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,300
- You don't need to threaten me.
- That's not a threat, lady, but this is.

1061
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,500
I know this game is a mile over my head,
but I'm telling you, if you fuck me over...

1062
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,700
I got where I am by collecting friends,
not enemies.

1063
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,300
Trust me, okay?

1064
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,700
You're on your own.

1065
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,600
What makes you think
I need help?

1066
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,200
Well,
the hundred people outside, for starters.

1067
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,700
It's not a problem.

1068
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,700
And they're fuelling
your jet right now as we speak.

1069
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,700
Come on. You're not that stupid.

1070
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,500
Here's what I'm thinking.

1071
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,100
If you give up now,
I can ensure that you'll serve the minimum.

1072
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,400
I'm thinking three years,
four years at the most.

1073
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,600
You can arrange that?

1074
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,600
Well, you haven't hurt anyone
or stolen anything,

1075
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,900
so yes, as a matter of fact, I can.

1076
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,400
- It's not good enough.
- Well, I wasn't finished.

1077
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,600
When you get out, you'll have $2 million.

1078
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,100
Will I? How?

1079
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:15,400
We'll put it someplace safe and it'll be
waiting for you when you get out.

1080
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,700
Thanks.

1081
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,000
But no, thanks.

1082
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,300
Oh, come on. I made you such a sweet offer.

1083
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,800
I really don't think you have much
in the way of alternatives.

1084
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,800
Why don't you talk to me about these
interests that you're in here to protect?

1085
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,700
- I'm afraid I can't.
- I can.

1086
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,500
Let me tell you a story.

1087
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,200
During World War ll, there was an American
working for a bank in Switzerland.

1088
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,000
Now, I don't need to tell you
that this period in history

1089
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,000
was rife with opportunity
for people of low morals.

1090
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,800
People like this man.

1091
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:52,800
He used his position with the Nazis
to enrich himself while all around him

1092
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:56,000
people were being stripped
of everything they owned.

1093
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:00,900
Then he used his blood money
to start a bank.

1094
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,300
Now,

1095
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,900
does this sound like
it might be the man you work for?

1096
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:10,300
Or am I just whistling Dixie out of my ass?

1097
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,400
- I believe we understand each other.
- Good.

1098
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,900
So, what the hell can you do for me

1099
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,600
since I clearly know more than you do,
and I've planned this to perfection?

1100
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,800
Believe me, if I need to,
I can change your entire programme.

1101
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,100
So, the sooner
that you stop being my problem

1102
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:30,700
and you start becoming my solution,
the better off you'll be.

1103
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,200
- What is it you want?
- Two minutes.

1104
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,600
The safety deposit box room.
I just need to go to one box.

1105
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,100
Looking for this?

1106
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,300
This could be very embarrassing
to your employer.

1107
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
He should have destroyed this
a long time ago.

1108
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,100
He didn't, so now it's mine.

1109
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,400
Now, if the day ever comes
where I have to stand before a judge

1110
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,400
and account for what I did here,

1111
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,700
you and your boss
will do whatever it takes to help me.

1112
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,100
You get out of here with that envelope,

1113
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:05,800
and we'll pay you a lot of money.

1114
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,400
I'll keep that in mind.

1115
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,300
You're not gonna tell me how you're
planning to get out of here, are you?

1116
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,700
I'm gonna walk right out the front door.
Anything else?

1117
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,400
- How did you know about all this?
- Doesn't matter.

1118
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,900
Fact is, all lies, all evil deeds, they stink.

1119
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,700
You can cover them up for a while,
but they don't go away.

1120
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,100
- Murder will out?
- Precisely.

1121
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,300
Well, I still don't get what you're
doing here.

1122
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,500
Really?

1123
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:33,200
Good.

1124
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:38,800
So, we spoke.

1125
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,500
Oh, no. You're gonna have to give me
more than that.

1126
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,300
- Let me have this window, fellows.
- Yes, sir.

1127
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,100
I told him that, well,
since he hadn't killed anyone,

1128
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,200
it wasn't too late to surrender
and get off with a lighter sentence.

1129
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,400
And?

1130
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,000
And that was basically it.

1131
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,300
You know, I don't ordinarily get offended

1132
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,600
the first time somebody treats me
like an idiot, but you are pushing it.

1133
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,200
Now, I know you did not go in there
to tell this guy something he already knew.

1134
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,800
Talk to me.

1135
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,400
Look, Detective.

1136
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,900
Our arrangement doesn't include me
giving you a detailed explanation.

1137
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,800
I say it does, okay?

1138
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,600
Okay, you don't own me.

1139
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,800
This cheque-cashing thing, this coke bust,
I can face that on my own.

1140
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,400
I know what I did and what I didn't do.

1141
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,000
- Talk to me.
- Off the record?

1142
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,900
"Off the... " Everything about you
is off the record. Just talk to me.

1143
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,700
- Well, I gave him an incentive.
- Okay.

1144
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:30,800
- Did he go for it?
- No. But I'd say he's considering it.

1145
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,900
He's smart, isn't he?

1146
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,800
- He thinks he is.
- Yeah.

1147
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,000
One of your types, like the Ivy League type?

1148
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,200
- Clearly well educated.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1149
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,300
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1150
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,300
You talk like him, so think like him.
What do you think he's gonna do?

1151
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,400
- Well, he's not gonna kill anyone.
- How do you know?

1152
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:55,400
- Because he's not a murderer.
- How do you know?

1153
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,600
I got news for you.
Most of the guys up in Sing Sing

1154
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,400
weren't murderers
until they killed somebody.

1155
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:03,400
You never know what a person will do
until you push him into a corner.

1156
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,100
But it doesn't seem
like you've pushed him into a corner.

1157
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,500
It doesn't, does it?
Seems more like he chose the corner.

1158
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,500
You're right.

1159
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,100
So, you through?

1160
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,400
- I guess. Are you saying I'm dismissed?
- Yes, I am.

1161
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,100
You got a card, in case I need to call you?

1162
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,500
Please don't take this personally, but no.

1163
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:26,400
I don't think you can afford me.

1164
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:30,200
Well, don't take this personally, Miss White.
Kiss my black ass, okay?

1165
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:34,700
Careful, Detective Frazier.
My bite's much worse than my bark.

1166
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,800
- So, how old are you, Brian?
- Eight and three-quarters.

1167
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,500
Eight and three-quarters. Big boy.

1168
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,900
- Were you scared in there?
- No.

1169
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:51,600
- No? Not at all, huh?
- Nope. I'm from Brooklyn.

1170
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,300
You're from Brooklyn, huh? I understand.

1171
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,000
- Guns don't scare me.
- They don't scare you?

1172
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,600
- Brave, too, huh?
- Yeah.

1173
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,100
So the guys that had the guns,
do you remember them saying anything?

1174
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,100
- Yeah.
- What'd they say?

1175
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,700
They asked me about my game.

1176
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,400
- Who did?
- The guy that robbed the bank. Duh.

1177
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,800
Son, be respectful.

1178
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,600
Okay, Brooklyn.
But it... Was he the one in charge?

1179
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,800
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

1180
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,700
And you don't remember anything else?

1181
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,500
He was kind of tall.

1182
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,500
He had a mask.

1183
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,400
Brian, you think you can recognise him
in any of these pictures?

1184
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,700
Take your time. Have a good look.

1185
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:29,900
Let's keep that over there. Just take a look.

1186
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,600
- With the mask, they look all the same.
- It's true.

1187
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,300
With the mask, they all look the same.
That's right, Brian.

1188
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,700
Attempted robbery. Liquor store.

1189
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,600
Well, this was a real step up
for a small-timer like you, huh?

1190
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,200
I got to hand it to you, Pablo.

1191
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,600
First of all, it's Paul. Not Pablo, okay?

1192
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,100
Excuse me.

1193
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:02,100
- You want some gum?
- No.

1194
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,500
And second, I didn't do it, all right?

1195
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:07,100
What? I made a few mistakes
when I was a kid.

1196
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:10,600
I was out with some friends
and they held up a liquor store.

1197
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,400
What was I supposed to do?

1198
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,300
Where'd you grow up, you Wassa Wassa,
Park Avenue?

1199
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:20,000
- What's that? Wassa what? What'd you say?
- Wassa Wassa.

1200
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,600
You know, a person
that don't come to your neighbourhood.

1201
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,900
How do you say "Rikers Island" in Spanish?

1202
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,600
What about these two?

1203
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,400
That ring a bell?

1204
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,800
These two? No.

1205
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,200
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

1206
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,700
Don't they look suspicious to you?

1207
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,200
I mean, I would think that you would
want to know who they are.

1208
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,600
No.

1209
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,300
- Well, thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1210
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:44,000
Hey, just out of curiosity
do you know anything about diamonds?

1211
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,200
A bit. What do you need?

1212
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,600
What do you think a guy like me
should pay for a diamond ring?

1213
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,600
Depends. How many carats?

1214
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,700
If you'd like, I could give you
my nephew's number.

1215
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,200
- Okay.
- You'll get a very good deal.

1216
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,200
What do you have on underneath?

1217
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,600
- Excuse me?
- Underneath your painter's coat?

1218
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,900
- What do you have on underneath?
- Clothing.

1219
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,100
Could you show us, please?

1220
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,400
You see, there's just you
and one other woman

1221
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,000
that fit the physical description
of the female suspect.

1222
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,300
What's that?

1223
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:18,000
It's your height, your age, and your...

1224
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,300
Your cup size.

1225
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,800
So, I violated Section 34 double-D?

1226
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,800
That's what you're telling me?

1227
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,700
How dumb do these morons have to be
to think they're gonna get a plane?

1228
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,000
This guy's no moron.

1229
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:36,700
I don't just mean him. Any hostage taker.

1230
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,700
Those ragheads at the Munich Olympics.

1231
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,800
Who the fuck ever got a plane?

1232
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,600
Shit, and these days?
This guy doesn't know that?

1233
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,900
The area is flooded

1234
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,400
with law enforcement right now.
Snipers are on rooftops...

1235
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,800
What you doing there, Keith?

1236
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:52,600
He wants a plane.
I'm gonna give him a plane.

1237
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,400
- What happened to playing it by the book?
- That's what's bugging me.

1238
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:00,200
It's like the other team read the book, too,
and they know exactly what we're gonna do.

1239
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:06,200
This whole time,
we're trying to stall him, right?

1240
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,200
Wrong. They're the ones that are stalling.

1241
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,700
Think about it.
The bullshit questions, the Albanian thing...

1242
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,300
So, you're saying he what?

1243
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,900
I'm saying that he wants
to give us more time. He makes demands.

1244
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,300
He gives us deadlines. We stall.
Then he gives us more time.

1245
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,800
I don't think he's in a rush.

1246
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,200
- Why?
- That's what I'm gonna find out.

1247
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,900
- Yeah.
- Your plane is ready.

1248
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,200
Is that a fact?

1249
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,800
That's a fact, but I'm gonna need something
from you first.

1250
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:52,900
I'm gonna need to come in there
and make sure the hostages are okay.

1251
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:54,700
You'll see them when they get on the bus.

1252
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:58,300
I just need to make sure
you're not leaving any bodies behind.

1253
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,400
Meet me at the front door.

1254
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:12,100
- What the hell just happened?
- You got to be crazy to go in there.

1255
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,100
Down the stairs.

1256
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,300
- Gum?
- Excuse me?

1257
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,500
- Would you like some gum?
- No, thank you.

1258
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,500
Let me take the kid.

1259
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,300
No.

1260
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,400
Any more?

1261
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,100
There are some who misbehaved.

1262
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:22,900
Please help me!

1263
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,100
Please help us!

1264
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,600
Please help us! Please!

1265
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,500
We're gonna get you all out of here.

1266
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,300
I promise you.

1267
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,300
Tour is over.

1268
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:46,100
- Can I ask you a question?
- There is nothing to talk about.

1269
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,500
What were you planning on doing

1270
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,500
if you actually got
the plane and the pilots, huh?

1271
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,400
- Excuse me?
- You don't want a plane. You never did.

1272
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,800
Who ever heard of bank robbers
escaping on a plane with 50 hostages?

1273
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:01,400
You saw Dog Day Afternoon. You're stalling.
Why? I don't know.

1274
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,700
What's the matter?
You can't get into the safe?

1275
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,400
Perhaps.

1276
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,800
There's two ways out of this.

1277
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:12,600
The easy way, we walk out the front door
together, or the hard boys cut the power,

1278
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,600
hit you with the tear gas,
and come in strong through the glass.

1279
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,600
It's your choice. You don't want that.
I don't want that.

1280
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,900
And, you know, they'd like to do it tonight.

1281
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,900
You got night vision?

1282
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,000
- You got gas masks?
- Maybe.

1283
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,800
- I'm this close to ordering it.
- Let's cut the crap.

1284
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,800
First, you don't order an assault
when no hostages have been killed

1285
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,400
and there's no immediate threat.

1286
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,600
Second, if it ends that way,
whatever happens,

1287
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,400
you don't get to be the hero.

1288
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,600
You want to bullshit me, try harder.

1289
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,600
Let's go.

1290
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:46,700
Okay.

1291
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:57,100
I tell you what. My ass is covered, sport.

1292
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:59,800
But I would not get too comfortable
in here if I were you.

1293
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,600
No? I got the cable guy
coming on Wednesday.

1294
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,900
- Why don't you just walk out the door?
- I will.

1295
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,900
I'm gonna walk out of that door
when I'm good and ready.

1296
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:13,200
Can I get you to do that today?

1297
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,300
I didn't think so.

1298
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,600
Any other proposals?

1299
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,900
Oh, please. Do not say "proposals. "

1300
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,800
My girlfriend, she wants a proposal from me.

1301
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:26,500
- You think you're too young to get married?
- No, I'm not too young. Too broke.

1302
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,800
Maybe I should rob a bank.

1303
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,600
You love each other?

1304
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,000
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

1305
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:36,200
Then money shouldn't really matter.

1306
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,500
Thank you, bank robber.

1307
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:42,000
I'm just saying money can't buy love.

1308
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:46,500
Thank you very much. I'm...

1309
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,200
I'm learning so much today, you know?

1310
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,700
Look, why don't we go across
the street to the Killarney Rose, huh?

1311
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,700
Forget about
this dangerous hostage situation.

1312
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,300
- I'll buy you a beer. My treat.
- Thanks, Detective,

1313
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,500
but I'm trying to stay away from bars,
if you know what I mean.

1314
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:05,600
Well, if you change your mind
there's still a standing offer, all right?

1315
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:13,000
Cellblock or the graveyard?

1316
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,900
Prison whites or a toe tag?

1317
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:18,400
- Make up your mind. Tick tock, tick tock.
- Hey! Hey!

1318
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:20,700
We done?

1319
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,600
You just crossed the fucking line!

1320
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,500
Buses, Kojak, parked outside.

1321
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:31,700
You think I'm bluffing?

1322
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,300
You roll the dice and see what happens.

1323
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:46,200
All right. Now get the bunker up.

1324
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,300
- So, what's up?
- Got him right where I want him.

1325
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,600
Yeah? Where's that?

1326
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:53,000
Right behind me with my pants
around my ankles, but it's a start.

1327
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:54,600
Jesus Christ.

1328
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,700
- What the fuck, man?
- How long?

1329
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,300
- He got the drop on you!
- Two.

1330
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:13,800
- How long?
- What if he saw your face?

1331
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:15,200
- Two.
- What if I didn't have my gun?

1332
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,000
Two, maybe three hours.

1333
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:20,200
You know, you're letting this cop
get too fucking close.

1334
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:24,500
What happened?

1335
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,500
I gave him every excuse
to blow my brains out.

1336
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:27,800
Yeah.

1337
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:30,900
He doesn't bite. Why? He ain't the type.

1338
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,400
Let's just step back
and think about this for a second.

1339
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,000
We know that they planned this whole thing.
The tape, the cameras, the costumes.

1340
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,500
There was a game plan,
but it never included aeroplanes.

1341
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,200
He's up to something but it ain't violence.

1342
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,800
I'm listening.
How's the reception?

1343
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:51,600
- Excuse me?
- The camera on the truck.

1344
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:54,600
Give me a close-up
on the second-floor window.

1345
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,300
- Rourke?
- I'm on it, I'm on it.

1346
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,300
No, no, no, no, no, no! Fuck!

1347
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,800
Oh, shit.

1348
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,200
Keith! Keith! Keith!

1349
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,900
What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

1350
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,000
You mean beyond the obvious?

1351
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:32,700
That's what I mean.
Come on, this ain't no bank robbery!

1352
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:35,600
This is your fault.
I told you to get the buses.

1353
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:39,100
Fuck you! I didn't kill anybody.

1354
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:43,900
I got 50 more people in here.
You fuck with me again,

1355
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,100
I'll give you two
of the longest days of your life.

1356
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:50,400
All right, look, just tell me what
it is you really want and I'll get it for you.

1357
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:53,400
- I promise.
- I've told you. Two buses, a plane.

1358
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,200
Right, right. And box seats
behind home plate at Yankee Stadium.

1359
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:58,600
Come on, don't bullshit a bullshitter.

1360
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:01,700
You planned every inch of this thing
right from the start.

1361
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:06,200
You got everybody marching to your beat,
including me, and I'm through buying it.

1362
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,900
You're too damn smart to be a cop.

1363
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,700
Now get the fuck out of here.

1364
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,700
What? You going to shoot me?

1365
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,900
Do it. Shit, you got nothing to lose.

1366
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,600
I damn sure ain't got nothing to lose,
so shoot me.

1367
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:20,900
Do it.

1368
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,300
- Shoot me.
- Fuck you.

1369
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,500
Tell them to send someone sane over here.

1370
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,000
We got a big problem.

1371
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,200
Hey, Detective, this ain't your day.

1372
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:07,500
How you doing, Captain?

1373
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,400
Look, I know you
put your trust in me and I just...

1374
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,200
Well, you're a good cop.
Frazier, I need more like you.

1375
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,700
But if you're going down on this one,
I can't go with you.

1376
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,400
You got to understand this, though, sir...

1377
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,600
No, no, no. Let me just tell you
what my problem is, okay?

1378
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,700
I go to bed, everything's hunky-dory.

1379
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:25,100
I get a call at 3:15, and there's what?
A dead hostage.

1380
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,400
- Right, right, right. But I can end this...
- It is ended.

1381
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,400
See, you think I got options.

1382
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,800
I got to answer to the Chief of D's.

1383
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:35,700
Darius is calling the shots on this. That's it.

1384
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,200
Hey, Sarge.

1385
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,500
- What'd he say?
- That's it.

1386
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,000
Shit.

1387
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:03,100
It's a tactical nightmare.
I know.

1388
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:06,300
Well, first, this is the only way in.

1389
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,600
Then we got to make it up the stairs blind.

1390
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,000
Once we get up there,
we're right out in the open.

1391
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:15,300
They have the advantage of cover.
They can pick us off like sitting ducks.

1392
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:19,200
Then if we make it across the floor
and down the stairs,

1393
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:22,600
we still can't tell the homies
from the good guys until they shoot at us.

1394
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,800
Even if it isn't rigged with explosives,
it's still a fucking nightmare.

1395
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,100
Move! Move! Move!

1396
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,500
Open the door!

1397
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:51,300
Keep moving.
To the right.

1398
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:52,900
Watch the hands,
watch the hands.

1399
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,500
And let's not forget the possibility
of hostages being killed.

1400
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:57,400
Right now! Put the gun down!

1401
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,300
Back off or I shoot! I said back off!

1402
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:03,700
Well, our best hope
is to separate them from the hostages.

1403
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,500
If we can get two or three upstairs
and take them out?

1404
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:07,900
Kill them?

1405
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:17,700
Gun! Gun! Gun!

1406
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,500
What if there's more than four?

1407
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:33,200
Yeah, well, that's what's so nuts about it.
Anybody in a painter's suit could be a perp.

1408
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:36,700
Maybe we should dress our guys up
like a bunch of painters.

1409
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:41,400
And we should use rubber bullets.
Take head shots. Put their lights out.

1410
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,000
Not a bad idea.
Yeah.

1411
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:47,000
Rubber bullets it is, baby.

1412
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:53,300
If this goes down wrong,

1413
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,500
they're going to dump this whole mess
in your lap, you know?

1414
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,500
- I'm making First Grade.
- What?

1415
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,700
I'm making Detective First Grade.
Things ain't all they appear to be.

1416
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,900
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Detective First Grade Keith Frazier.

1417
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:09,100
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Yes.

1418
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:11,900
Thank the Mayor
and our mystery guest for that.

1419
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,700
You cut a deal with those guys?

1420
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,300
Never make First Grade? Shit.

1421
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,100
Worked too hard to let that happen.

1422
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:22,900
Everybody's getting theirs.
I'm gonna get mine.

1423
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:26,400
I'll be outside.

1424
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,800
What a day, what a day.

1425
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:37,600
Detective, they're gonna storm that bank
without you? It's not right.

1426
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:42,000
So, tell me about the kid
who pointed the gun at you, the 12-year-old.

1427
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,800
- Now?
- Yeah.

1428
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,300
Last year, up in the 33rd,

1429
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,200
I was breaking up a fight
about a half a block from the high school.

1430
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,900
This one little spic is getting
his clock cleaned by another one.

1431
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:55,500
Do me a favour, Sergeant.
Just tone down the colour commentary.

1432
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,600
So I bust up the fight,

1433
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:03,300
I turn around
and this kid is pointing a. 22 at my chest.

1434
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,500
- Is that right? Now, which kid was this?
- Another kid, an African-American.

1435
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,200
- An African-American, right?
- Yeah.

1436
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:10,800
Came out of nowhere. I didn't see him.

1437
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,100
So, what'd you do?

1438
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,200
What did I do then?
I'll tell you what I did then.

1439
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,500
I got shot in the fucking chest.
That's what I did then.

1440
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:19,900
Yeah, so you'll pardon
my euphemisms, Detective,

1441
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:23,500
but I would rather wind up an old bigot
than a handsome young corpse.

1442
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,300
Now, no offence, Detective,

1443
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,900
but I'm just trying
to keep them away from us.

1444
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:31,100
Now, what do you say we just
get these people safely out of the bank?

1445
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:32,400
I hear that.

1446
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,600
And I'll try and watch
what I say in the future.

1447
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,700
You never know who's listening.

1448
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,700
What are you doing?

1449
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,000
Jesus. Shit.

1450
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,100
They bugged us.

1451
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:59,000
They bugged us.

1452
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,000
Darius!

1453
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,600
Darius, don't make a move!

1454
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,500
- What?
- It's all fucked up!

1455
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,500
Do not make a move! Keep your men back!

1456
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,100
What are you talking about?

1457
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,800
They heard everything we said in the M.C.C.

1458
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
- What?
- Stand down! Stand down!

1459
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:19,300
The drawer with the demands in it!
They heard everything we said!

1460
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,800
They put a transmitter in it!
They bugged us!

1461
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,800
No, no, no. I'm going in.

1462
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,500
Shit.

1463
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,200
Get everyone together.

1464
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,700
Steve! Steve-O!

1465
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,200
They're coming in.

1466
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,100
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

1467
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,100
All right! Everybody out!

1468
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:50,000
- Put your masks on!
- Everyone out! Out!

1469
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,500
- Go now!
- Go!

1470
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,800
Go! Go! Go!

1471
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:57,900
Now!
Get the fuck out!

1472
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,400
Move!

1473
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,500
Everybody up the fucking stairs!
Move!

1474
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:13,800
Move!

1475
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:43,700
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

1476
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:46,500
- Get down! Get down on the ground!
- Don't shoot!

1477
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,000
Cease fire!

1478
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,500
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1479
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,900
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1480
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,200
Let's go, people.

1481
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:20,800
Put your hands on your head!
Get down!

1482
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,300
Put your hands on your head.

1483
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,400
- Will somebody stop him?
- Get down!

1484
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,300
Put your hands on your head.

1485
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,400
- Put your hands on your head.
- Get them down!

1486
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:31,300
- On the ground!
- Put your hands on your fucking heads!

1487
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,000
Do not move!

1488
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:37,100
- Get down, put your hands on your head!
- Put the cuffs on them! Let's go!

1489
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:41,500
What's going on?

1490
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,000
Don't take any chances!

1491
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:54,000
It wasn't me! I'm not a criminal!

1492
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:56,200
Cuffs!

1493
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:00,000
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1494
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,000
- Don't move!
- I'm not moving!

1495
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,700
- Don't move!
- Do not move!

1496
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:13,700
Check them. Make sure they ain't got
no weapons on them and shit.

1497
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,500
Hernandez!
Right here.

1498
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:20,100
E.S.U. team, line up!

1499
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:33,100
Door to the left, door to the left.

1500
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,400
- Clear on the right.
- Clear!

1501
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,900
- Left side clear.
- Clear!

1502
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:44,200
- Clear.
- Clear.

1503
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,700
- All clear!
Check under the desk.

1504
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:50,100
- Clear.
- Checking the office. All clear, Sarge.

1505
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:52,900
- Clear.
- Clear.

1506
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:54,200
Clear.

1507
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,200
Clear.

1508
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,900
All clear, Sarge.

1509
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:04,000
All clear. E.S.U. on the stairs.
Line it up!

1510
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,300
Let's go, guys.
Team in, team in. Let's go.

1511
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:20,900
Clear!

1512
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:22,500
- Clear.
- Clear.

1513
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:26,900
- Clear.
- Clear.

1514
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,100
Clear.

1515
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,600
- Clear, Sarge.
- Clear.

1516
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,800
Give me a bunker up here.
I need a bunker up front.

1517
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,600
Bringing the bunker up.

1518
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:36,900
Clear, Sarge.

1519
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,500
Clear.

1520
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,200
- We're almost clear down here.
- Make sure you're sure.

1521
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:45,000
- I'll keep looking.
- Stay on it.

1522
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:46,500
Roger that.

1523
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,200
Ready? Let's go.

1524
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:54,400
This is the last door.

1525
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:04,200
- Clear, Sarge!
- Come on down.

1526
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,300
Did you find a dead hostage?
- Negative.

1527
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,300
If it ain't here,
you must've missed something.

1528
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:18,100
Maybe, but I'm pretty sure we're
the only ones moving around down here.

1529
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,100
Check this out. They forgot to rob the joint.

1530
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:23,600
Holy shit.
And you didn't find anybody?

1531
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:25,900
We're still looking,
but there are no bad guys,

1532
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:28,200
no booby traps, no tunnels, no damage.

1533
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:29,700
- And nothing missing.
- Great, great, great.

1534
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:32,600
We'll put out a city-wide description
for David fucking Copperfield, then, huh?

1535
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,700
Listen, I'm not trying to tell you
your jobs, Detectives,

1536
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:36,800
but unless they swam out
through the toilets,

1537
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,700
whoever did this
is upstairs sucking pavement.

1538
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:40,100
All right, good job.

1539
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:41,400
What's that?

1540
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:45,300
Cell phones.

1541
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,200
- Hey, guys! You need to see this.
- Okay.

1542
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,500
Collins! Grab a uniform, make a quick count
of that money in there, all right?

1543
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:55,500
- Yes, sir.
- And stand by, all right?

1544
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:57,500
Don't let anybody get tempted,
including you!

1545
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:58,700
Yes, sir!

1546
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,800
Right here, Detective.

1547
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,400
- What do you got?
- You're going to love this one. Toy guns.

1548
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:06,800
Fake guns. You got to be kidding me.

1549
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:10,500
- Toys.
- As if it wasn't weird enough already.

1550
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:12,800
Cap,
come to the ladies' room.

1551
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:14,700
On my way.

1552
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:33,900
Check it out.

1553
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:37,100
We can stop looking for that body.

1554
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:38,900
Fake guns.

1555
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,500
Fake execution.

1556
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:44,700
Nobody goes home
till we get everybody's story.

1557
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:47,500
Cap, we got something else
in the storage room.

1558
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,100
- Porcario?
- Yo.

1559
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:04,700
- Where's the men's room?
- Down the hallway on the left.

1560
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,800
Pick them up, pick them up. Toss them.

1561
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
I'm a hostage.
Stop pushing.

1562
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:47,400
Female hostages to be searched
by female officers only!

1563
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:50,700
All right, listen,
let's get these people up.

1564
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:52,900
- I can't hear you. What?
- Valerie Keepsake.

1565
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:54,900
Valerie Keepsake. Go, go, get on the bus.

1566
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:56,800
- Kenneth Damerjian.
- Yeah.

1567
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,200
Person one.

1568
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:00,900
- I'm Peter Hammond.
- Eric Dodge.

1569
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:03,800
- Wait!
- Chaim. My name's Chaim.

1570
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:07,400
Fucking cocksucker.

1571
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:09,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1572
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,800
Just give me your name.
Just give me your name.

1573
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,700
Say your name.

1574
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:16,500
I work in the bank!

1575
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:19,300
I'm the bank security guard!
Nobody's listening!

1576
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:20,700
Okay, we'll straighten it out.

1577
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,500
Everybody's saying listen!
Nobody's listening!

1578
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:23,900
We'll straighten it out. Come on.

1579
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:26,000
- Listen, I'm not getting on the bus!
- Yes, you are.

1580
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,500
Move! Move! Move!
- I am not! I work at the bank!

1581
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,000
Collins, you got this?

1582
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:31,500
Listen, I work at the bank!

1583
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:33,700
All right, just get him on the bus.
Get him on the bus.

1584
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:37,100
- Nobody's listening!
- All right. Calm down. Get on the bus.

1585
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,900
Come on, guys, guys!
Over this way. Over this way.

1586
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,500
Officer, take her over to Sarge. Come on.

1587
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,000
Come on, let's get going
with these people off that line over there.

1588
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:00,400
Come on.

1589
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:10,700
Captain, I'm telling you,
this thing is a mess.

1590
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:13,800
They thought this one out, soup to nuts.

1591
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,400
So, lay it out for me.

1592
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,700
We photograph everybody
that came out of the bank.

1593
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,600
We sit them down, we question them,
we show them the photos.

1594
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:25,200
Most of them can't point to anybody
that's guilty of anything.

1595
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,300
We ask them if they could recognise
anybody who was not one of the bad guys.

1596
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,100
Even if we considered someone
as a possible suspect,

1597
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:34,900
there's one or two or three other people
that would rule them out.

1598
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:36,400
It's like the thing never happened.

1599
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,300
- What about prints?
- Everywhere. So what?

1600
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:43,600
- All it shows is that these people were there.
- Alibis?

1601
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,200
Just about everyone.

1602
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:47,100
Even if their alibi was weak,

1603
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:50,200
a hostage would identify them
as being one of the good guys.

1604
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,900
There we are, back to square one.

1605
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,100
Priors?

1606
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:56,400
We got one employee who had
some juvie stuff. One customer had...

1607
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:57,800
Excuse me.

1608
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,100
One customer had an out-of-state warrant
for child support.

1609
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:04,100
Another one had a couple of priors,
G.L.A. mostly.

1610
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,900
Again, same problem.
Plus, he was a fucking idiot.

1611
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,100
- Bank cameras?
- Useless.

1612
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:12,500
I'm telling you,
they thought of everything. Almost.

1613
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:14,900
- Sounded like everything to me.
- But this.

1614
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:18,200
We haven't found that. 357
or the perp that was holding it.

1615
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:21,100
If you did, there'd be no prints on it anyway.

1616
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:23,400
- Bury it.
- Bury it?

1617
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:25,900
What the fuck do you expect me to say?

1618
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:33,400
Captain, this thing stinks to high hell.
I mean, somebody did something here.

1619
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,000
You said it yourself.

1620
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,700
You got no robbery. No suspects.

1621
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:40,500
Nobody's breathing down my neck
to come up with answers.

1622
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:43,200
I'm not gonna breathe down yours. Bury it.

1623
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:48,500
I wasn't expecting this.

1624
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:51,600
I promise you,
I'll find you guys more cases to solve.

1625
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:55,300
Okay.

1626
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:59,800
Oh, here's something
that you probably did expect.

1627
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,600
- They found that missing Madrugada money.
- No shit.

1628
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,500
Yes, you want to know where it was?

1629
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:08,700
- In my bank account?
- No.

1630
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:11,100
- My summer house in Sag Harbour?
- No.

1631
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:12,800
- My wallet?
- No.

1632
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:16,500
Then, no. I don't want to know.

1633
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,100
This is bullshit, man.

1634
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:28,400
I mean, we're the only ones left
trying to catch the bad guys

1635
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:30,200
and they're gonna come after us like that?

1636
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:32,200
I'll tell you what.
Every one of your accusers, man,

1637
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:35,600
I say we go after them all, Keith,
Michael Corleone style.

1638
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:37,900
"Michael Corleone,
do you renounce Satan?"

1639
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:39,600
"Yes, I renounce him. "

1640
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,800
There's no 392.

1641
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,800
- Huh?
- Safety deposit box number 392.

1642
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,100
According to these records, it doesn't exist.

1643
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:50,800
Pinstriped, mayonnaise, lying motherfucker.

1644
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:54,100
- Didn't Coughlin say we should move on?
- Let's go.

1645
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,900
Thank you, again, Your Honour.
I'll come pick it up tomorrow?

1646
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
- Yes, you're welcome.
- Thank you.

1647
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,400
What are you doing, Detective?

1648
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,900
Now, what business do you have
with Judge Pasqua?

1649
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:20,500
Police business.

1650
01:45:20,700 --> 01:45:24,000
- Weren't you told to bury this?
- I got a job to do, Miss White.

1651
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:26,800
And since when is your job
more important than your career?

1652
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:29,400
- Or did you forget our arrangement?
- We didn't have any arrangement.

1653
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,000
Let me tell you how this works. You...

1654
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
No, let me tell you how this works.

1655
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:36,300
You press here to record
and you press here to play.

1656
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,700
There's
also the matter of the $140,000

1657
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,100
that seems to have walked away

1658
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,800
from the Madrugada cheque-cashing bust.

1659
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:45,200
I didn't have anything
to do with that, so...

1660
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,400
We'd like to be
in your corner on that.

1661
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,300
In exchange for what? I mean, what,
do you want me to do something unethical?

1662
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:52,400
I mean, no disrespect to the both of youse

1663
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:54,500
but I don't need you
to be in my corner, Mr Mayor.

1664
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:56,000
Look, I'm innocent.

1665
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:58,800
Innocent or guilty,
you're still going down.

1666
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:03,500
Give Miss White whatever
she needs, or your career is over.

1667
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:05,200
Done.

1668
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:06,800
Kaput.

1669
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:11,200
So? You gave me what I wanted.

1670
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:14,400
Your career is blossoming
and all is right with the world.

1671
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:16,000
What was Case hiding?

1672
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:22,600
You know, there's a famous saying
by the Baron de Rothschild.

1673
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:27,600
"When there's blood on the streets,
buy property. "

1674
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:33,100
I think Mr Case
really took that sentiment to heart.

1675
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:36,100
But he is no different
than half the Fortune 500.

1676
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,300
Let it go, Detective.

1677
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,300
You're a good cop.

1678
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:44,800
This city needs you.

1679
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,400
- Lady! Lady, you're in the wrong place.
- I have an appointment.

1680
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:26,300
Arthur.

1681
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:29,600
- Good morning.
- Miss White.

1682
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:31,800
Have a seat.

1683
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:36,500
Thank you, Vincent. That's all for now.
Thank you.

1684
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:42,300
Well. What did he say?

1685
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:45,300
Well, Detective Frazier
turned out to be quite sharp.

1686
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:48,600
But I just fast-tracked his career a little
and he's under control.

1687
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:51,600
I hope so. Tell me about the envelope.

1688
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:53,300
Where is it now?

1689
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:56,200
Well, the gang leader
is going to hang on to it,

1690
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,400
as an insurance policy
to keep you from seeking revenge.

1691
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,900
Clearly, he has a very low opinion of you.

1692
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:04,300
And what might that be?

1693
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:07,600
Well, let's see.
In a nutshell, that you got rich,

1694
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,900
doing business with the Nazis
during the Holocaust.

1695
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:15,300
Yes.

1696
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:19,500
It was 60 years ago.
I was young and ambitious.

1697
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:23,000
I saw a short path to success and I took it.

1698
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,300
I sold my soul.

1699
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,900
And I've been trying to buy it back
ever since.

1700
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:35,400
But you and this mystery man,
you have an understanding?

1701
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:39,500
I think so. And he managed
to get out of there with that envelope.

1702
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:43,800
If someday
he comes back to blackmail you, well,

1703
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,400
you'll pay him. And you'll get it back.

1704
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:50,800
- So, I guess that's it.
- I suppose so.

1705
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:52,700
- Bullshit.
- I beg your pardon?

1706
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:56,600
He didn't go through all that just to stick
your envelope under his mattress.

1707
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:59,600
Look, they left money untouched, Arthur.

1708
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:00,800
So?

1709
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:05,100
So, he had to have walked out of there
with something else.

1710
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:08,800
The bank says
that there was nothing missing.

1711
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:11,400
So, there had to have been
something in that box

1712
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:14,200
that was worth more to him
than your envelope.

1713
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:18,100
You don't have to tell me.

1714
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:20,800
There's only one thing it could be anyway.

1715
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,100
Diamonds.

1716
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:28,000
And then there's the ring.

1717
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:30,100
Cartier ring.

1718
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:33,600
It belonged to the wife of a Parisian banker.

1719
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:36,700
Wealthy family of French Jews.

1720
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:40,400
And when the war came along,
the ring and everything else they owned

1721
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:45,300
was confiscated and they were shipped off
to concentration camps. None survived.

1722
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,100
We were friends.

1723
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:51,800
I could have helped them.

1724
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:58,400
But the Nazis paid too well.

1725
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:04,900
Can I trust that you will keep
what you've learnt

1726
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:08,400
here today confidential?

1727
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:11,800
Despite whatever you may think?

1728
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:22,300
Yes, Arthur.

1729
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,400
Well, I'd love to tell you
what a monster you are,

1730
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:31,700
but I have to help bin Laden's nephew
buy a co-op on Park Avenue.

1731
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:38,500
If that were true, you wouldn't tell me.

1732
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:40,900
We're listing you as a reference.

1733
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,800
My name is Dalton Russell.

1734
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,200
Pay strict attention to what I say

1735
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:03,800
because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

1736
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,600
I've told you my name. That's the "who. "

1737
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:11,300
The "where" could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

1738
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,500
But there is a vast difference

1739
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:17,000
between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.

1740
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:20,400
The "what" is easy.

1741
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:26,000
Recently I planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

1742
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:29,100
That's also the "when. "

1743
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:34,400
As for the "why, "
beyond the obvious financial motivation,

1744
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:37,000
it's exceedingly simple.

1745
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:38,900
Because I can.

1746
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:42,200
Which leaves us only with the "how. "

1747
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:46,000
And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

1748
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,600
lies the rub.

1749
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:41,400
He's gonna smell like shit.
What do you expect after a week?

1750
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:44,900
Yeah.

1751
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,800
Why do you think I rolled down the window?

1752
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:08,800
Oh, shit.

1753
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:16,700
That cop, Frazier, and his partner
are walking into the bank.

1754
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:20,100
- Are they coming for me?
- Can't say. It's just the two of them.

1755
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:30,700
Yeah, everything's going great today.
No.

1756
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:34,000
Yeah, about 5:30. Okay.

1757
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:37,100
Sounds like fun. Okay.

1758
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:39,400
Talk to you later.

1759
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:02,600
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

1760
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,300
Mr Hammond?

1761
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:09,100
Good morning, Detectives.

1762
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,300
Just like he planned.

1763
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,800
I got a court order here
to open a safe deposit box.

1764
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,900
Number 392.

1765
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:31,900
Oh, thank God.

1766
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:39,100
Where is it?

1767
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:41,300
I left it in there.

1768
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:43,000
This way, Detectives.

1769
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:45,600
Why did you do that? You left the ring.

1770
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:47,000
Trust me.

1771
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:49,600
I left it in good hands.

1772
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:52,200
I'm no martyr.

1773
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:54,600
I did it for the money.

1774
01:54:56,300 --> 01:54:59,800
But it's not worth much
if you can't face yourself in the mirror.

1775
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:03,300
Respect is the ultimate currency.

1776
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:10,100
I was stealing from a man
who traded his away for a few dollars.

1777
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:14,500
And then he tried to wash away his guilt.

1778
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:19,600
Drown it in a lifetime of good deeds
and a sea of respectability.

1779
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:22,600
- Let me get that.
- Let me.

1780
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:24,100
It almost worked, too.

1781
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:25,300
Okay.

1782
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:28,800
But inevitably,

1783
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:31,900
the further you run from your sins,

1784
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:35,700
the more exhausted you are
when they catch up to you.

1785
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:37,200
And they do.

1786
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:40,600
Son of a bitch.

1787
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,000
Certain.

1788
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,600
It will not fail.

1789
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,900
What do you think that's worth?

1790
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:53,900
If you got to ask, man,
you can't afford it.

1791
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:56,300
Thank goodness my girlfriend ain't here.

1792
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:00,300
"Follow the ring"?

1793
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:17,300
- Detective Frazier.
- Mr Case.

1794
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,500
- How are you?
- I am great.

1795
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,200
Nobody got killed at the bank.
Everybody's happy. My kind of day.

1796
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:25,300
That's wonderful. Wonderful.

1797
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:27,100
- Detective Mitchell.
- Mr Case.

1798
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:29,200
- Be seated, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

1799
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:31,600
- Can I offer you anything?
- No.

1800
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:33,300
I must say

1801
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:35,900
I was most impressed

1802
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:39,100
by the way you handled that business.

1803
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:40,500
Thank you, Mr Case.

1804
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:42,400
Whenever I hear the term
"New York's Finest"

1805
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:44,300
you're who I think of.

1806
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:47,600
You keep the rest of us safe
and make it look easy.

1807
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,300
- Pardon me.
- Well, what's so amusing?

1808
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:55,300
When you say "the rest of us," Mr Case,
I mean, you got to look around.

1809
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:59,400
"The rest of us" is a category
that you haven't qualified for in a long time.

1810
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:02,200
Touché, Detective.
I won't deny it. I've done well.

1811
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:04,500
Yes, you have. But I'm very confused.

1812
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,300
You see, I got a case

1813
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:10,000
where armed robbers
laid siege to your bank.

1814
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:11,400
It is your bank, right?

1815
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:13,400
Well, I'm Chairman of the Board of Directors.

1816
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:15,200
Then ita-zita-vene-gazoo.

1817
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:17,200
The robbers disappear. Poof.

1818
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,900
And they don't take a nickel, right?

1819
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:21,300
- You're asking me?
- Yes, I'm asking you.

1820
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:23,600
I mean, it's your bank. You own it.
I'm asking you.

1821
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:25,600
It's a tiny part of our organisation.

1822
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:27,800
No robbers. No real victims.
No loot missing.

1823
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
It's got to be the first time
in law-enforcement history.

1824
01:57:30,100 --> 01:57:31,300
I never heard of it before.

1825
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:34,300
So, you got to ask yourself, "What the fuck
happened?" Don't you, Mr Case?

1826
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:36,000
I'm not quite sure I like your tone, Officer.

1827
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:38,400
You don't like my tone?
Then give me a straight answer.

1828
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:42,300
It's the founding bank of your empire.
You built it. It's your baby.

1829
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:44,500
Give me a straight answer.
What do you think happened?

1830
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:48,200
- I have no idea.
- Oh, come on, now. Come on.

1831
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:49,700
I'll tell you what I think happened.

1832
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:51,900
I think you sent that woman in there
to patch things up.

1833
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:54,600
Miss White. I think you paid her.
What was she doing in there?

1834
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:56,100
Look, this is absurd.

1835
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:58,100
Are you implying that
I had anything to do with it?

1836
01:57:58,300 --> 01:57:59,800
392.

1837
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:02,800
Safe deposit box 392.
What's the story on that?

1838
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,300
- I have no idea what you're...
- Don't lie to me, Mr Case.

1839
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:07,900
- I don't lie.
- I looked at all the records.

1840
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:11,500
All the bank records
for safe deposit boxes at your bank.

1841
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:14,400
At first glance, everything looked fine,

1842
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:17,500
but there was one safe deposit box
that had no records.

1843
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:19,600
I mean, going all the way back to 1948.

1844
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:22,700
So I started thinking.
Who would have the answer to this riddle?

1845
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:24,700
Probably the man who forgot to mention

1846
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:27,100
that he built the bank
in the first place in 1948.

1847
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:30,000
It doesn't add up, Mr Case.
It does not add up.

1848
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:35,200
I'm afraid I can't be
of any further use to you, Detective.

1849
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:38,900
It's something really bad, isn't it?

1850
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:44,200
Mr Frazier, I have spent
my whole life serving humanity.

1851
01:58:45,900 --> 01:58:47,800
You can ask anyone who knows me.

1852
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:52,100
They'll vouch for me,
and for the things that I've done.

1853
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:55,100
You think they'll vouch for you
after I find out the truth about this ring?

1854
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:56,800
I don't think so.

1855
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:04,300
Oh, by the way, that thing you said
about us being New York's finest?

1856
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:07,100
I want you to know,
we really appreciate that.

1857
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:09,100
How gracious.

1858
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,600
Let's go. We're gonna follow that ring.

1859
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:22,200
- Hey, Keith, let me see your shoe.
- What?

1860
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:24,600
- Let me see your shoe.
- Why?

1861
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:28,700
'Cause I have never seen anybody
put their foot that far up a guy's ass.

1862
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:32,500
Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I?

1863
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:35,200
Oh, man. You cut him an ass
the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

1864
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:37,900
We're gonna need a traffic cop on that shit.

1865
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:47,800
Good afternoon, sir.

1866
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:49,700
- Do you have a reservation?
- Looking for the Mayor.

1867
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:51,700
- May I have your hat, please?
- No, you cannot. Get your own.

1868
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:54,400
They're looking to invest
$4 billion over the next four years.

1869
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:55,700
And that's all in place.

1870
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:58,600
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Mayor,
but there's an old American saying,

1871
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:02,500
"When there's blood on the streets,
somebody's got to go to jail. "

1872
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:06,200
Edwin, could you please excuse us
for a minute?

1873
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:09,900
What's this about, Detective?

1874
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,400
I believe Detective Frazier
is looking for some closure?

1875
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:16,100
That's a good word. Closure.

1876
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:18,800
Case closed, you know what I mean?

1877
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:20,200
This is the number

1878
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:24,300
of the War Crimes Issues office
in Washington, D.C.

1879
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,600
How'd you like to be on the front page
of the New York Times?

1880
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:29,800
That'd be great.

1881
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,800
Make sure they spell my name right, though.
That's Frazier with a "z".

1882
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:35,800
You can keep the pen.

1883
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:38,000
You made copies?

1884
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:40,900
Please.

1885
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:44,600
We got to keep the real criminals
off the streets, Your Honour.

1886
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:48,800
All right, well, thanks for lunch.

1887
02:00:53,300 --> 02:00:54,800
War crimes, huh?

1888
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:57,800
What have you got me into this time?

1889
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:18,500
Mama?

1890
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:25,900
- Did you bring Big Willie?
- And the twins.

1891
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:40,800
Slow down, girl.

1892
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,300
I'll get my gun off
before I get my gun off, okay?

1893
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:44,700
Pow, pow.

1894
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:28,200
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

1895
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:30,600
Why don't you
just walk out the door?

1896
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:31,800
I will.

1897
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:34,900
I'm gonna walk out of that door
when I'm good and ready.

1898
02:02:35,100 --> 02:02:36,400
Son of a bitch.

1899
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:46,600
Come on, honey.
The handcuffs are getting cold.
