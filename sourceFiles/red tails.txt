2
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,827
Where are
the damn fighters going?

3
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,208
They've gone chasing scalps,

4
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,089
leaving us unprotected again.

5
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,594
Damn those
glory-grabbing bastards!

6
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,469
Bandits! Hundreds of them!
Six o'clock!

7
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,473
Is there anything
left of our escort?

8
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,640
Negative, boss.

9
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,889
Damn it! Why don't
they worry about us?

10
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,226
I can't believe this!
It never fails.

11
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,004
Oh, no.
Stay with me.

12
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,530
This is Bouncing Betty.
Engine three is out.

13
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,785
We're falling back. Two,
you take lead position.

14
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,878
Need the extinguisher.

15
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,956
Hank!

16
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,926
Mayday! Mayday!
Prepare to bail out.

17
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,806
I repeat, prepare to bail...

18
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,654
Red One to Red Two, come in.

19
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,456
<i>Are you awake
over there, Lightning?</i>

20
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,836
Yeah, yeah, sorry.
Boy, I need a nap!

21
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:54,758
Well, look alive. Wouldn't
want you to miss this war.

22
00:04:55,754 --> 00:05:00,681
War is hell. What we're doing
is just boring as hell.

23
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,639
Whoever she was, I hope she
was worth losing sleep over.

24
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,309
Oh, trust me, she was worth it!

25
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,399
<i>Junior.
Junior, you okay?</i>

26
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,858
Fine as wine, Red One. The sky
is blue and my guns are hot.

27
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,035
<i>Joker, you all right?</i>

28
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,740
Nope. I feel like I'm flying
my grandfather's Buick.

29
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,999
Coolant indicator's
all over the map.

30
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,329
And to think I was as happy as a
church lady when I got this plane.

31
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,798
All right, Red Four, you're done.
Take it on home.

32
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,170
Come on now, Captain, this gauge
over here is a piece of crap.

33
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,933
Captain, let me give it a looky
before you send him back.

34
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,396
He's not trailing
any oil or water.

35
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,362
Seems to me like he's
just got a bad indicator.

36
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,578
Come on, Easy. Let
me fly, sir, please?

37
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,826
You know it ain't gonna be
no fun without me.

38
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:11,338
All right. Okay.
You stay on, Red Four.

39
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,711
You stay on, but you keep
an eye on it, all right?

40
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,963
Thank you, sweetheart.

41
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,545
Just my luck I get stuck
with the flying wreck.

42
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,300
Another P-40 from
Uncle Sam's junkyard.

43
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,060
It looks like we
got a truck up there.

44
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,770
It's got German markings.

45
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,105
Junior, it's your turn.

46
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,313
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

47
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,985
Prepare to feel
the wrath of the Ray Gun.

48
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,280
I'm on your wing, Junior!

49
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,287
Come on.

50
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,180
You see that?

51
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,394
Congratulations, kid.
You killed yourself a truck.

52
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,595
Whoo-hoo!

53
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,646
We can go back victorious.

54
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,731
Everybody, form up.
We're going home.

55
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,819
Uh...

56
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:20,650
Easy, I see something. It's a train!
Eleven o'clock.

57
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,614
I don't think it's German.
I don't see any guns.

58
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,946
Looks like they're
moving livestock to me.

59
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,204
No. It's military.

60
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,160
It's camouflaged.

61
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,334
It could just be cows.

62
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,460
You don't want to shoot up no
cows if you don't have to.

63
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,917
Unless y'all
planning on a barbecue.

64
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,502
Nobody sees any guns?

65
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,929
I'm telling you, Easy,
that's a munitions train.

66
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,256
And I bet it's
armed to the teeth.

67
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,133
You grown-ups better think fast.
It's headed for that tunnel.

68
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,184
All right. Only one way to find out.
Let's go get it.

69
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,985
Wait. Easy,
we got to take it head-on,

70
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,279
low, so their guns
can't hit us.

71
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:03,572
It's my decision, Lightning.
Stay in formation.

72
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,012
Looks like these
cows are armed.

73
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,057
Come on.

74
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,023
Stay in front of it!

75
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,643
Die, you Nazi dogs!

76
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,983
Dang! Those cows
just shot up my wing!

77
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,284
No sweat. No sweat.

78
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,296
If that train makes it into the
tunnel, they'll stop in there.

79
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,464
Where's Lightning?

80
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,965
<i>Where the hell
are you, Lightning?</i>

81
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,298
Taking the train from the front,
like you should have done.

82
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,438
Come on. Come on. Come on.

83
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,772
Gotcha!

84
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,068
Whoa! Shit!

85
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:35,992
Whoa!

86
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,171
Whoo!

87
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,542
Nothing like a good old
Georgia ass-whupping.

88
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,593
Just trying to keep
you boys inspired.

89
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,545
<i>How's this headline
for inspiration?</i>

90
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,849
"Negro Pilot Dies Because He's
Too Stupid To Follow Orders."

91
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,726
Your plane looks like
it's been through a shredder.

92
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,442
How are you going to
explain that to Coffee?

93
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,276
By explaining to him that I'm
the one who blew up the train.

94
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,884
You boys go on ahead.
I've spotted something.

95
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,262
Lightning destroyed
another one.

96
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,635
Look at that mess.
Look at that mess.

97
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,138
I guess we'll be
working all night again.

98
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,892
<i>It's been a long time
since you've seen your sweetheart.</i>

99
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,690
<i>Too bad she's
dancing with someone new.</i>

100
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,517
<i>This is Axis Mary coming to you</i>

101
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,070
<i>from Berlin with
your favorite music.</i>

102
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,074
<i>Never thought that you would be</i>

103
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,993
<i>Standing here so close to me</i>

104
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:39,120
<i>There's so much I feel
that I should say</i>

105
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:44,208
<i>But words can wait</i>

106
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:48,918
<i>Until some other day</i>

107
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,724
How about one time you bring my
plane home without wrecking it?

108
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,800
Good morning, Mr. Coffee.

109
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,681
You keep tearing up
my planes like this,

110
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,638
you're gonna be wearing
your balls for a necktie.

111
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,769
See, I can't let you do that,
'cause I just saw a goddess

112
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,566
who's gonna bear
my beautiful children.

113
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,736
You're a clown, Lightning.
You need to grow up.

114
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,187
We can't afford to
have any more planes

115
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,068
taken off the line
with your stupid...

116
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,740
What is this?
What did you do?

117
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,442
Oh, man! Where did
that come from?

118
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,945
What happened was...
Sticks!

119
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,030
Come see what this
clown did to the plane.

120
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,581
I can see what you're thinking.

121
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,417
What the hell is this? Did
somebody throw a train at you?

122
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,622
Coffee, I can see you're upset.

123
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,338
Maybe we should talk
about this another time.

124
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,680
Oh, we got a new recruit here!

125
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,598
Hey there.
You lost, son?

126
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,851
I was looking for Jimmy Wayans.

127
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,738
Uh, Jimmy got shot down must've
been, what, two weeks ago?

128
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:52,860
I believe so.

129
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,488
Well, is Uly Douglas here?

130
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,613
Uh-uh.

131
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,287
Furball's dead, son.
Crashed on takeoff.

132
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,490
You're just a bad-luck
Chuck, aren't you?

133
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,200
Everybody you know ends up on
the wrong side of the dirt.

134
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,621
Don't pay him no mind, boy.
My name's Smokey.

135
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,627
This here's Neon,
this is Joker.

136
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,549
Flight Officer
Maurice Wilson, sir!

137
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,133
You can leave all that saluting, son.
You're home now.

138
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,384
Seeing as how
everybody you know dead,

139
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,589
you might as well bunk with us.

140
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:19,674
Wait. Wait. Wait.

141
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,601
Just don't bad luck us before
you get up in this Jeep now.

142
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,429
Yes, sir.
I'm trying to live.

143
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,889
Come on, Maurice.
Come on, boy.

144
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,269
Come on, boy, get in there!

145
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,600
Hold on.

146
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:29,900
Come on, Maurice.

147
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,774
Wait, you've got to back up.

148
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,328
How'd it go up there, Ray?

149
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,544
I'm telling you, Deacon.

150
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,088
Lightning almost got himself
killed again today.

151
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,258
He's one crazy pilot.

152
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,470
I'm going to pray for him if we
ever get to see any real combat.

153
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,976
Well, hey, I see you here
after every mission.

154
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,649
I'm sure your
prayers are helping.

155
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,192
Thanks, Deke.

156
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:29,794
Black Jesus, we thank you for bringing
Red Squadron back home to us.

157
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,676
Lightning's usual elegant work.

158
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,723
Although I understand your plane
didn't fare any better than the train.

159
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,270
Sir.

160
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,723
That old Lightning don't
never have his brakes on.

161
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,059
Questions, gentlemen.

162
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,269
Does it really matter, sir?

163
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,821
- Lights up.
- Here we go.

164
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,317
What was your question?

165
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,575
What we do, how well we
do it, does it matter?

166
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,580
Strafing runs and
coastal patrols.

167
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,415
They got us out here using
planes to mop floors, fellas.

168
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,124
I don't normally
go in for loose talk,

169
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,381
but we won't even be
doing that for long.

170
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,800
Ain't that why Colonel
Bullard went stateside?

171
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,267
The Colonel's business
stateside is above your grade.

172
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,428
All due respect, sir,
but are they back there

173
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,808
deciding if they
should shut us down?

174
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,184
Just a rumor, Winky.

175
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,358
You know this how?

176
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,689
Pass it up.

177
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,411
Read it, Easy.
Out loud.

178
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,366
Go ahead, son.

179
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,422
"The use of Negroes in the Army
Air Corps may yet be halted."

180
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,468
"A report has been forwarded calling
the performance by Negro pilots"

181
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,136
"unsatisfactory."

182
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,092
"A plan to assign the Negroes
to routine convoy cover may be"

183
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,973
"all that remains
for those who seem"

184
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,019
"to have neither
the intelligence"

185
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,565
"nor the proper reflexes
for such a complicated task"

186
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,769
"as fighter pursuit.
The great Tuskegee..."

187
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,150
"The great Tuskegee experiment"

188
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:24,735
"to allow the Negro type
to fly airplanes has failed."

189
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,927
And you all thought what?

190
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,183
You'd sign up.

191
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,390
You get shiny boots, a uniform,

192
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,771
and that'd be the end
of 100 years of bigotry?

193
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,273
You're colored men
in a white man's army.

194
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,527
It's a miracle you're
flying fighters in Italy,

195
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,576
and not mopping
latrines in Milwaukee!

196
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,744
You want it straight?

197
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,620
Yes, the old man's stateside,
fighting the good fight.

198
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:15,956
And when he
comes through for us,

199
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,881
we better be damn sure we're
ready to do the same for him.

200
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:25,133
Any of you feel otherwise, any of
you want to wash yourselves out,

201
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,589
well, Negro, please do so,

202
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,720
and I'll have you on the
next thing smoking back home

203
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,894
to make room for the men
who want to stand and fight.

204
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,266
Get your head up, son.

205
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,103
You're fighter pilots.

206
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,280
Watch the rest of the film.

207
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,278
Learn something.

208
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,755
When we came under
your command, Colonel,

209
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,460
you stated very clearly that
we would never find Negroes

210
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,715
who could pass a pilot's exam,

211
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,014
make it through flight school,
survive basic combat.

212
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,933
A combat record which,
to this point...

213
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,602
We've done all of that.

214
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,226
To this point,
I don't believe your boys

215
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,103
have scored
a single aerial kill.

216
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:23,186
Because you have not assigned
us a single forward mission.

217
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,067
It's damn hard to
shoot down the enemy

218
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,274
100 miles behind
the front lines.

219
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,529
As a matter of fact,
when will we be

220
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,953
assigned to
bomber escorts, Colonel?

221
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,407
There have been any number of
reports of poor discipline.

222
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,493
Which is in every newspaper
and magazine in the country.

223
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,249
We have enough
race troubles as it is

224
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,707
without these sons of bitches in the
press throwing fuel on the fire.

225
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,423
How an unofficial assessment
of the Tuskegee program

226
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,300
made its way to
newspapers and magazines

227
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,973
may be worthy of
its own hearing, sir.

228
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,801
Colonel Tomlinson,
you've been supporting

229
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,978
this experiment
from the beginning,

230
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,391
but I'm afraid you're just gonna
have to suffer its failure.

231
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,894
We're given
hand-me-down planes.

232
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,447
Ordered to attack targets that
have already been bypassed.

233
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,322
Fly patrols where the enemy
hasn't been seen for months.

234
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:16,531
Now we've clone every lowdown,
dirty job you've handed us,

235
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:20,039
hoping that we would just
limp along and go away.

236
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,711
We will not go away.

237
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,881
We have a right to
fight for our country,

238
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,300
the same as
every other American.

239
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:32,756
So you shut us down,
or you let us fly.

240
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,933
<i>Soldier boy</i>

241
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,605
<i>Oh, do you think about me,
soldier boy?</i>

242
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,682
<i>How could you ever...</i>

243
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,901
What?

244
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,024
Don't give me that look.

245
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,481
What the hell were you
doing up there today?

246
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,782
Beating up on Hitler. Winning the war.
I got the train, didn't I?

247
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,114
I love you like a brother, Joe.

248
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,289
But you disobey
my orders again,

249
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,457
I'm gonna have to write you up.

250
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,664
For what?
For being right?

251
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,710
I told you those
guns were there.

252
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:04,787
You almost got yourself killed.

253
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,372
No, I followed protocol.

254
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,628
You went for the glory.
There's a difference.

255
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,585
Now you may not need me to get
you through this thing alive,

256
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:14,047
but Joker, Junior, the rest
of the squad just might.

257
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,851
Okay. You're right,
I'm wrong. I'm sorry.

258
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,304
What you in such a
hurry for anyway?

259
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,683
I saw a girl.

260
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,518
The most beautiful
I have ever seen.

261
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,320
Just can't let them
alone, can you?

262
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,984
No more than you can
let that bottle alone.

263
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:39,156
You got your way of getting
through the war, and I got mine.

264
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,164
I wonder what your
pops'd say to that.

265
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,413
We can just leave
him out of this.

266
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:50,500
He's got you in a pressure cooker, man.
Graduating college at 20,

267
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,006
4.0, and now a captain?

268
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,678
Pushing yourself mighty
hard to please him.

269
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,765
Didn't I just say we can
leave him out of this?

270
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,433
All right.

271
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,433
Besides, I drink 'cause I got
to bunk with your crazy self.

272
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,641
You bunk with me 'cause I'm the
best pilot in the whole damn Army,

273
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,601
and you're just hoping
you're gonna learn something.

274
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,692
If I'm not mistaken,
I'm the flight leader,

275
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,240
which would make you
my wingman.

276
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,407
Smarter doesn't
make you better.

277
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,985
Better at what? Busting
up Coffee's planes?

278
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,444
Romancing the ladies, for one.

279
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,029
Now if you're done whining,

280
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,365
I have got a pass to do
that very thing right now.

281
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,742
Lightning.
Can I ask you something?

282
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,825
What?

283
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,708
What's going to happen when you go
home and the women speak English,

284
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:31,382
and they understand just how
full of bullshit you are?

285
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,551
What's this?

286
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,880
Something to celebrate you being
old enough to know better.

287
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,063
Ha!

288
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,642
<i>"Italian for Beginners"?</i>

289
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,985
How many cartons of smokes
this set you back?

290
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,108
A simple "thank you"
wouldn't hurt.

291
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,440
And a "happy birthday"
would have been fine.

292
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:56,866
Knowing you,
you're just tired of me

293
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,443
embarrassing myself
in front of the signorinas.

294
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,903
Yeah, that might be it.

295
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,573
How you feel?

296
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,667
A whole lot more
than one year older.

297
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:08,752
Thank you.

298
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,296
Happy birthday.

299
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,917
It's tight.

300
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,507
Pilots got you all hot and bothered.
Come on.

301
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,309
Coffee!

302
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,812
We got three planes, the
hydraulic pumps are shot.

303
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,483
Two more got bad governors.

304
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,938
Grab a piece of that tape
and put it over that hose.

305
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,858
What are you doing, Lightning?

306
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,660
What?
What did you say?

307
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,782
Come on, Lightning.

308
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,535
I need it back by nightfall!

309
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,366
And ask if she's got a sister!

310
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,417
Yeah, a blind one!

311
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,391
I'm sorry to bother you.

312
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,977
I flew around your
house this morning.

313
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,981
Okay. Uh...

314
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,873
Right, you...

315
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:32,999
Si.

316
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,251
That was me.
I'm Joe.

317
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,665
Joe.
Yeah.

318
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,459
<i>D'accordo.</i> Sofia.

319
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,715
Sofia, right.
Nice to meet you.

320
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,805
Thanks.
Mama.

321
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,816
Little.
Joe Little.

322
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,204
I hope I'm not
intruding, ma'am.

323
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:12,960
Thank you.

324
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,083
Ah!

325
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,969
Ah!

326
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:34,065
Hold on. I want to
ask you something.

327
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,451
How?

328
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:50,532
Oh, how? I got a Jeep. You
want to come for a drive?

329
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:51,908
<i>Dove?</i>

330
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,127
What's <i>dove?</i>

331
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,416
Dove.

332
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,756
Is that a yes?

333
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,139
You want to bring your mother?

334
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,302
It's going to be
tougher than I thought.

335
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:30,204
What you going with?
I got two pair.

336
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,073
And three of clubs.

337
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,830
I don't care what you have,

338
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,285
you'll never be
able to beat me, son.

339
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,787
You ain't got
enough in the head.

340
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,248
I can't lose. I don't
even know why y'all try.

341
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,880
You just got here, Maurice. I
hope you're learning something.

342
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,427
Hope at least
you're learning by now

343
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,095
not to play poker
with people that cheat.

344
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,388
I ain't cheating.

345
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:49,928
You cheat.

346
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,975
I don't want to learn
how to play cards,

347
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,974
I want to learn
about combat flying.

348
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,353
Dogfights and tricks for
switching it up on them Jerries.

349
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,189
What the hell you think it is
we know about dogfighting?

350
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,690
The white boys are
the only ones get to

351
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,772
tangle it up with
the Jerries around here.

352
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,857
But they don't
talk to us much, so...

353
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,867
Experience is a cruel teacher. She
gives the exam first, then the lesson.

354
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,288
You know what?

355
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,580
I decided when I get home...

356
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,748
Yeah.

357
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,292
...people ask me
about the war,

358
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,789
I'm going to
just make stuff up.

359
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:25,797
Hell, I already do! Ask me what I
killed, seven trucks, five Jeeps,

360
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:29,255
and one of those motorcycles
with the sidecar on them.

361
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,512
My record look like the inventory
down at the motor pool.

362
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,843
How the hell am I
gonna go back home

363
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,054
and tell my dad all I
killed were traffic?

364
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,355
He'll whup my ass!

365
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,186
What's that?

366
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,609
It's my Buck Rogers
X-38 disintegrator pistol.

367
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,946
Makes me feel like...
You know,

368
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,699
like I can't lose.

369
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,234
Here, try it.

370
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,035
No. No, thanks, Junior.

371
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,580
I don't really like to fool with
other people's good luck charms.

372
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,205
What's the matter?

373
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,206
Nothing. Um...

374
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,295
Look, I don't like
being called Junior.

375
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,968
I want the tag Ray Gun.
I'm not a kid.

376
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:12,549
I did two years at Howard before I
even enrolled in the Tuskegee program.

377
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,847
I'm going to be an engineer.

378
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,766
What about you?

379
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,807
My dad's a judge.

380
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:25,106
He wants me to
go to law school,

381
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,402
so I guess I'm gonna do that.

382
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,650
You ought to just give it up!

383
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,106
Go back to where you came from.

384
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,736
I'd rather be up there
killing Jerries

385
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,160
than down here playing
games with you, Joker.

386
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:37,035
Look, don't be in a hurry to
get to the killing part, Maurice.

387
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,912
Tell me something.
You scared of dying?

388
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,129
I don't know.

389
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,794
I am.

390
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,758
Every time I close
the lid on that canopy,

391
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,761
I feel like I'm shutting
the lid on my own coffin.

392
00:27:56,425 --> 00:28:00,350
I tell you something else, the pilot that
tells you otherwise is either a liar

393
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,690
or too foolish to
know any better.

394
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,059
Amen.

395
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,112
It's useless.

396
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,488
All this talk for another
study, another inquiry.

397
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,986
"Politics is
the art of..."

398
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:19,156
Major Kessel's political science
class, the quote that he used...

399
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:23,369
He said, "Politics is the art of
postponing a decision until it is..."

400
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,580
"No longer relevant."

401
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,751
Colonel
Mortamus stumbled badly.

402
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,178
If he hadn't
embarrassed the brass

403
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,722
by leaking that report
to the press,

404
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,016
they probably would have
let you wither and die.

405
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,640
His politicking
bought you time.

406
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,764
For what?

407
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,604
Operation Shingle.

408
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,685
Air cover for a beach landing.

409
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:52,148
It's your chance to go up
against German fighters.

410
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,984
I'll say this, Jack.

411
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,870
Even when your hope is
false, it sure is grand.

412
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:03,246
I'm serious, A.J.
I can get that for you.

413
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,628
If you stick your
neck out how far?

414
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,168
I don't want you to put your
career on the line for me, Jack.

415
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:17,261
A little less tin on my
uniform is the least of it.

416
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,762
If I get you the mission,

417
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,639
your men have got to
put something on the board.

418
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,766
They come through,
or Mortamus and the brass

419
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:27,850
will have all they need
to shut the whole thing down.

420
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,399
You get us that mission,

421
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,606
we will light up the board.

422
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,614
Has this flight order
been verified?

423
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,201
Yes, sir. It came directly
from Colonel Bullard in Washington.

424
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,123
Check it again. Get the
flight leaders together.

425
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,752
Sir.

426
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,845
The Colonel got us an opportunity.
Gather around, gentlemen.

427
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,797
Attacking another train, sir?

428
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,431
Or did we graduate to minding
a truck convoy this time?

429
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,387
Operation Shingle.

430
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,606
It's an ambitious
landing off the coast

431
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,309
of the Tyrrhenian Sea
at Nettuno.

432
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,022
We've been given the frag order

433
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,482
to provide air cover
for the landing.

434
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,024
Yeah!

435
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,317
Whoo!

436
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,825
I'm gonna have so many of those
little swastikas on my plane,

437
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,451
they're gonna think
it's camouflage.

438
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,659
We will repay the old man
with victory, hear me?

439
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:28,744
Yes, sir!

440
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,206
Full briefing at 0400.
On the flight line at 0530.

441
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,962
Good luck, gentlemen.

442
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,513
Junior, where you at, boy?
You're gonna miss the flight.

443
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,603
<i>I know I'm late.
I'm coming.</i>

444
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,561
We're a long way from Memphis,
but Black Jesus is here with me,

445
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,862
and he says it's gonna
be a successful mission.

446
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,190
Now does that mean we're gonna
shoot down a bunch of Jerries,

447
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,946
or we gonna come back
in one piece,

448
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,869
or Lightning gonna pick up
some girls along the way?

449
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:08,288
No more pickups for me, boys.
I swear to you, lam in love.

450
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:12,254
Love? Swearing? Both
bad luck in my book.

451
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:19,086
<i>I can't believe I made it.
Don't tell Easy I was late.</i>

452
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,392
They all set?

453
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,469
All ready, sir!

454
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:28,975
Send them off.

455
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,210
Hallelujah. The saints
are marching in!

456
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,062
Watch me become
an ace today, boys.

457
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,438
Lightning, did you
just say you're gonna

458
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,110
become an ass today, or an ace?

459
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,482
I couldn't quite
hear what you...

460
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,190
<i>Was it ass or ace?
I couldn't hear.</i>

461
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,150
I think you heard
him right, Smokey.

462
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,449
All right, men,
cut the chatter.

463
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,709
Jesus.
Would you look at that!

464
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,891
Oh, my goodness.
Just like in the newsreels.

465
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,450
Keep your eyes peeled
for the Jerries.

466
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,887
Bogies inbound, twelve o'clock.

467
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,760
And they're
closing in mighty fast!

468
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,312
These pilots are rookies!
Make quick work of them.

469
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,517
All planes, hold formation.

470
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,068
Hold on.

471
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,153
Come on, come on, come on.

472
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,539
Anytime, Red One.

473
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,498
Drop tanks!

474
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,089
Oh, shit!

475
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,593
<i>I'm shaking them!
There's two more!</i>

476
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,098
Yes. They're cutting left!

477
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,226
<i>Put a
little hitch in his giddyup!</i>

478
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,352
<i>I'm feeling good now!</i>

479
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,853
<i>Remember,
keep the beachhead clear.</i>

480
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,560
<i>It's clear.</i>

481
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:24,192
<i>Straighten up
over there, Junior.</i>

482
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,899
Let's go, Lightning.
I'm on one.

483
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,076
<i>I'm behind you. Break right!</i>

484
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,402
I got him.

485
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,658
Get on the inside, Easy!
Get on the inside.

486
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,382
Come on, slip just a little.

487
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,255
Come on, tighter, tighter.

488
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,518
Congratulations, Captain.

489
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:03,023
You are the first Negro to
shoot down a Jerry! Whoo!

490
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,523
Ha-ha!

491
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,195
Junior!
Straight ahead now.

492
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,823
There's my swastika.

493
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,699
I'm on your wing.

494
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,077
Come on, baby, just move
a little bit closer.

495
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,457
All I want is
a little bitty kiss.

496
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,255
Just give me a little
peck on the cheek. Yeah!

497
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,088
Good shot.

498
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,349
Oh, hell.

499
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,191
Joker, there's one on my tail!

500
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,275
Okay, listen, Junior. Buttonhook
right, and I'm gonna go left.

501
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,075
Come on.

502
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,496
No touchdown for
you today, Fritz.

503
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,553
Junior, you're
all clear, buddy.

504
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:18,468
Deke, on your right!

505
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,182
I see him.

506
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:29,066
Let's give those newspapers
something to write about.

507
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,698
Tennessee says hello!

508
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,132
There's the squad leader.
I'm gonna take him out.

509
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,631
Careful. He's good.

510
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,178
You're letting him
get away, Lightning!

511
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,851
I'm just toying with him.

512
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,767
This is for you, Pretty Boy,
with your bright yellow nose!

513
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,144
Come on, boy. Line it up.
One shot.

514
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,150
Holy crap!

515
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:18,744
How'd he do that?

516
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,163
<i>Get him off me!</i>
I'm on him.

517
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,239
<i>Get him off me!</i>

518
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,619
Get out of the way, Lightning!

519
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,622
Open your throttle.

520
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,248
Come on, man!
Take him out!

521
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,879
<i>I can't get a clear shot.
Hold on.</i>

522
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,760
Drop to your right.

523
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,391
All right! I got him.

524
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,060
Oh! Thank you, Lord.

525
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,773
And there I was thinking
you didn't love me any more.

526
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,600
He's headed home to mama.

527
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,321
You thinking what I'm thinking?

528
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,819
<i>If you're thinking
I should finish him off</i>

529
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,448
<i>so we can get back to the
beachhead, then, yes.</i>

530
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,369
Or we could follow him.

531
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,197
We could go
after their airdrome.

532
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,497
I don't know, Lightning. We got orders.
You know that.

533
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,170
Come on, Easy. I'm talking
about a Jerry airbase.

534
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,964
Dozens of planes!
You're saying no?

535
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,335
All right. I'll trust
your instincts this time.

536
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,671
But we're running low on fuel. We're
gonna follow for five minutes.

537
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,848
You got that?
Five minutes.

538
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,351
Joker, you back there?

539
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,726
We're still back here.

540
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,481
Junior?

541
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,229
I'm ready for a turkey shoot.

542
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,955
Mayday! Mayday!

543
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,254
There it is, boys.
Get your scorecards ready.

544
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,620
Gotta knock out those fighters
before they take off.

545
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,502
Got to take
those guns out first.

546
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,765
Everybody, form up.

547
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,820
Here we go!

548
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,023
Brand-new 109s.

549
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,130
Not so brand-new 109s.

550
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,168
Like ducks in a row.

551
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,029
All right.
Two at once!

552
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,157
That's nothing. Watch
me get four this time.

553
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,735
Touchdown!

554
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:24,941
<i>We're running low on fuel.</i>

555
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,322
No time for celebration.

556
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,166
Whoo!

557
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,370
The Ray Gun strikes again.

558
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,125
Junior, watch out
for that flak!

559
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,681
Good job, Lightning.

560
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,523
<i>Washington brass won't
be able to ignore this.</i>

561
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,465
My God!
Those pilots are African!

562
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,929
Hey! What happened to Junior?

563
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,225
There he is.

564
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,724
Three o'clock high.
He's trailing oil.

565
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,435
Red One to Red Three.
Junior, come in.

566
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,401
I took something in the leg.

567
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,320
Something in my head.

568
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,945
Level off, Junior,
or you're gonna stall out.

569
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,993
All right.

570
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:20,811
Oh, yeah!

571
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:31,651
Yeah!

572
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,528
Yeah!

573
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:37,289
Yes!

574
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,352
Whoa!

575
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,898
They done shot down the whole
Luftwaffe, didn't they?

576
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,143
Yes, they did, huh?
Those hotshots sure did.

577
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,489
Never doubted it.

578
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,822
Did I make it?

579
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,955
Yeah, you made it, damn Knucklehead.
Should have let you crash.

580
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,581
You'll be okay.

581
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,583
No surprises, Ray Gun.
You get healthy, all right?

582
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,760
Luck is with you, Ray!

583
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:43,523
I think we can cautiously
declare the landing a victory.

584
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,477
It's a slog, but the
ground troops are holding.

585
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,232
Colonel Bullard.

586
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:49,820
Sir.

587
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,149
Your boys chalked
eight kills in the air,

588
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,450
63 aircraft destroyed
on the ground.

589
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,198
No losses in their first wave.

590
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:59,156
Outstanding. Pass along
my congratulations.

591
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,115
Thank you, sir.

592
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,206
Action reports and
assessments by 1500.

593
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,292
Colonel.

594
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:15,468
Eight German fighters
or 80 German fighters,

595
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,470
it still doesn't change what I
think of you and your boys.

596
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,636
We don't care.

597
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,182
Respect the uniform.

598
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:32,318
Believe me, sir, that is
all I have respect for.

599
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,700
It's not as bad as all this.

600
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:47,629
Leg's good, eye's fine.
In a week's time,

601
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:51,674
I'll be able to see fine out of one
eye and mostly out of the other.

602
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,841
"Mostly."

603
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,216
Is that what you
want me to tell Stance?

604
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,548
"Sir, Ray Gun has one-and-a-half
eyes' worth of ability."

605
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,853
Look, come on.
I landed a plane blind.

606
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:05,434
Lightning...

607
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,436
Hey, don't get me in this.

608
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,439
If the Flight Surgeon
won't clean bill you,

609
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,236
what do you expect me to do?

610
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:15,945
Just talk to him.
He listens to you.

611
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,157
I mean,
you got the same respect

612
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:23,035
on this base
as the old man, so...

613
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,920
I'd rather be dead
than on the ground.

614
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,557
Easy, you're
the best friend I got.

615
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,351
Please don't do this to me.

616
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,139
General Luntz, Colonel Bullard.

617
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,065
Thank you, Lieutenant.

618
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,569
Colonel, please.
Thank you.

619
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,701
No, thank you, sir.

620
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,163
Colonel, I'm in a hell of a fix
with our target in Europe.

621
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,912
Our boys are
getting cut to shreds.

622
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:11,546
I read the action report
from Operation Shingle.

623
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:17,673
Eight kills in your first wave.
Thirteen in ail.

624
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,757
That's a right trick.

625
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:23,849
Colonel, I'll give
it to you straight.

626
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,392
I can't afford
the kind of losses

627
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:26,890
my bombers have been suffering.

628
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,516
Do you have film
of the air cover

629
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,644
your bombers are
getting now, sir?

630
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,730
We need to change
the way we fight.

631
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:42,611
I need pilots who will fly close and
tight to the heavies all the way.

632
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,580
Not put my men in harm's way
by chasing rabbits.

633
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,373
So you're asking me
to tell my men

634
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,543
not to shoot down
Jerry fighters?

635
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:54,213
I'm asking them to put the
bombers ahead of themselves.

636
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,508
I don't care if they never
splash another Jerry fighter.

637
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,211
I need to get my heavies
to the target and back.

638
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,719
The losses from enemy air, I believe
my men can get that down, sir.

639
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:08,553
If you can bring back one or two
more of my planes every mission...

640
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:13,142
Sir, I believe we can cut
your losses by 70% or 80%.

641
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,443
Colonel, the word is
you're arrogant.

642
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:21,699
If "arrogant" is the only word
people use to describe me now,

643
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:25,369
I would say I think
I'm making progress.

644
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,793
Can you help us?
I'm asking you man to man.

645
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,421
Can you help save lives?

646
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:47,680
We need new planes.
No more hand-me-downs.

647
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,475
If you get us new planes,

648
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,431
we can help your boys.

649
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:01,781
I got a bullet right through my canopy.
I ought to be dead, y'all.

650
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,358
But nothing
happened to me though.

651
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:04,909
It's Black Jesus,
I'm telling you.

652
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,863
Oh, go on with that.
Let's play.

653
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,198
Don't sass Black Jesus, now
you might need him one day.

654
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,410
What happened to you is luck.
Just luck.

655
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,494
Lords of Poker,

656
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:17,797
Black Jesus, White Jesus,

657
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:20,341
Tooth Fairy, Easter
Bunny, all of them!

658
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:23,636
I done lost all my damn money.
Something is wrong.

659
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,758
Ain't that right.

660
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:27,966
How about you just get wise?

661
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,301
There is no special
mojo running the world.

662
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,352
Things just are how they are.

663
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,645
Us getting shot up

664
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,815
and the people we're protecting
not caring a thing for it.

665
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,767
I hear that.

666
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,524
You talk real tough, Joe Little.
Real cold.

667
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:42,230
Well, reality's
a little chilly.

668
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,735
Is that right?
Let's play!

669
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,658
Let me tell you about
this cold, hard brother.

670
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,907
While y'all trying to get by with
your whiskey and cigarettes,

671
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,158
guess what he's
doing with his rations?

672
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,454
- What's that?
- What he doing?

673
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,658
Trading them all for lingerie
to spoil his old lady.

674
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:54,867
Oh, really?

675
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,623
Perfume, silks.
Aw!

676
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,796
That tease!

677
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:02,717
Yeah, well, lucky at love
and lucky at cards.

678
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:06,087
Right like that. Boom!

679
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:33,080
Man, you are so beautiful.

680
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,629
Of course, you have no
idea what I'm saying.

681
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,496
I love you.

682
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,669
Oh, uh...

683
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:27,794
Wow, that's...

684
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,428
Uh...

685
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,553
Uh...
Shh!

686
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,713
What are you doing here?
This is an officers' club.

687
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:07,128
I am an officer.

688
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:10,507
This is a whites-only
officers' club.

689
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:14,591
You're off
the reservation, pal.

690
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:18,932
Try the Italian dance hall
near the main plaza.

691
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,727
Hey. Go home, nigger.

692
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,606
I got what I came for.
Good night.

693
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,597
Am I going
to be court-martialed?

694
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,272
I don't know.

695
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,482
I'm sure you trying to start a
race riot won't help you...

696
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,400
I was finishing
what they started!

697
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,479
Wrong or right,
we got regs to live by.

698
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,438
And you throwing punches,
busting them up, gets you what?

699
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,321
A good feeling, Easy.
Right here.

700
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,153
A throb that says I didn't choke
on what they were feeding me.

701
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,325
How do your heart feel? You say
"they" like it's all of them.

702
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:22,284
Same as always. "Shuffle
along, cause no strife.

703
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:25,586
"Don't scare the ofays
by speaking out."

704
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:29,919
Some other time I'd have stood

705
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,212
with you, side by side.
"Some other time"!

706
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,919
But you put a minute's worth of
righteousness ahead of a whole war!

707
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,508
Ugh!

708
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,089
Same old Joe Little.

709
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,892
Still getting into the wrong
fights for the wrong reasons.

710
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,095
Your reasons any better?

711
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:49,398
You spent your whole life being one
big, lousy Atlanta Compromise.

712
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,855
Well, go sell that somewhere else.
I'm not buying it.

713
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,279
I've come bearing gifts.

714
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,035
I'm all ears, sir.

715
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,709
Bomber escort
New P-51 s.

716
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,912
You did it.
You really did it, sir.

717
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,247
Come on. Let's get some food.
I'm hungry.

718
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,547
Welcome home, Colonel.

719
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:23,905
Lieutenant Little
. What am I going to do with you?

720
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:29,285
Everything's a fight, isn't it?

721
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:33,418
It must be so goddamn
exhausting being you.

722
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,172
You know something, Joe Little?

723
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:40,421
You're a punk.

724
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,309
You remind me

725
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,772
of one of those kids
from a comic strip,

726
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:53,646
walking around,

727
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,525
pushing his sleeve up one arm,

728
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,775
hand balled in a tight fist,

729
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:06,288
walking and looking at the
world through a squint.

730
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:12,461
Always looking to knock something
down just because it's standing.

731
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,591
It's right there.

732
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,964
It's right there.

733
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:27,134
You really want to
knock something down?

734
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,304
Try using that.

735
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,897
Because I will
tell you straight,

736
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:38,820
I don't have
anything against you.

737
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:43,325
I have the highest
expectations for you.

738
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,961
Lieutenant Little,

739
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,211
I need everyone on
this next mission.

740
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:02,420
And you're lucky you're the
best damn pilot we've got.

741
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,425
Report to your unit.

742
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:07,595
<i>Bless you</i>

743
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:11,395
<i>For being an angel</i>

744
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,941
<i>Just when it seemed</i>

745
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:20,021
<i>That heaven was not for me</i>

746
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:25,818
<i>Bless you, for building...</i>

747
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,372
They let you out, huh?

748
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:37,083
Or did you bust out?

749
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,539
Very funny.

750
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,042
Look, uh.

751
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,803
I said some things.

752
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,381
Yeah, you did.

753
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:51,309
I didn't mean them.

754
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:52,887
Yeah, you did.

755
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,184
You know me. Act
first, think later.

756
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:02,025
Well, nobody's perfect.

757
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,194
We good?

758
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,736
Yeah, we're good.

759
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,585
I figured it out.

760
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,759
What? That throwing punches
doesn't solve your problems?

761
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:25,840
No.

762
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,215
That maneuver Pretty Boy
pulled on me, got on my tail,

763
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,471
I figured out how to do it.

764
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,392
Fancy trick flying
will only get you killed.

765
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,603
Or make me an ace.

766
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:49,202
The American pilots flying escort now
go for every kill they can score.

767
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:52,746
That's how they were trained.
That's how they fight.

768
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:57,330
Here's how we change up the strategy.
Lights up.

769
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:03,545
At all costs, under every circumstance,
you protect the heavies.

770
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,875
Colonel.

771
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,843
We signed up to shoot
Germans, not babysit planes.

772
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,800
You signed up to follow orders.

773
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,136
One bomber, that's 10 men.

774
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:20,975
You getting one Jerry so you
can put a cross on your plane,

775
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,106
that doesn't balance that.

776
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,896
We count our victories

777
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:29,358
by the bombers we
get to their targets.

778
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:32,741
By the husbands we
return to their wives.

779
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,165
By the fathers we get
back to their children.

780
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,953
What has not changed,
what will never change,

781
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:45,671
from the last plane, to the last
bullet, to the last minute,

782
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,797
to the last man, we fight.

783
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,299
We fight!

784
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,675
Yes, sir!

785
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:02,642
We've secured new aircrafts.
P-51s.

786
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,602
The best the AAF's got.

787
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:09,990
As soon as we get the A-okay, we'll
begin ferrying them in from Bari.

788
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:13,869
Dismissed.

789
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,044
Say cheese, say cheese.

790
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:32,504
Whoo-hoo!

791
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,055
My, my, my!

792
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,891
Hey, Maurice!
How are they flying?

793
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,728
Like angels.

794
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:42,769
I don't know any angels with
six .50-caliber machine guns.

795
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:45,442
All right, men, get your manuals.
Get familiar.

796
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,110
Coffee!
Yes, sir.

797
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,155
We'll need them all marked
up and ready to fly.

798
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,277
It's taken care of.

799
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,906
The Major says paint their tails
bright red, so they stand out.

800
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,157
Like the Red Baron.

801
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:57,995
Loud and proud.

802
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,197
Appreciate it.

803
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:04,411
Beautiful.

804
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:15,055
<i>Blue skies smiling at me</i>

805
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:20,474
<i>Nothing but blue skies do I see</i>

806
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:23,101
This will definitely make
the group distinctive.

807
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,184
Bright red tails
and black pilots?

808
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:30,271
You can't call us nothing
else but distinctive.

809
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,942
From now on.

810
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:40,326
<i>Never saw the sun
shining so bright</i>

811
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:43,579
<i>Never saw things going so right</i>

812
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,331
What do you think?

813
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:48,459
It's like it's speeding
even when it's sitting.

814
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:54,135
I never even met a girl
as beautiful as this plane.

815
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,130
Well, take good care of her.

816
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:58,640
What do you mean?

817
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,717
I twisted
the Flight Surgeon's arm.

818
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,598
Got you back on the roster.

819
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,554
You going up with us
next mission.

820
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:11,569
Uh...

821
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:13,522
Sorry.
Thank you, sir.

822
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,941
I'm going to tell the guys.

823
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:51,018
Heavenly Father, we thank
you for this glorious day.

824
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,069
We ask that you
send your angels down

825
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:56,068
to surround us as we
fly through the sky.

826
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,408
We know that it's
part of your master plan

827
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:01,532
that we've made it all the way
from Tuskegee here to Ramitelli.

828
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,247
We are very confident
in our abilities,

829
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:08,372
but we ask that you give
us the vision, the sight,

830
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,833
and the speed and power to
make it through this mission.

831
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:14,291
All the airmen say, "In
Jesus' name we pray." Amen.

832
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:15,466
Amen.

833
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,590
- Nothing's difficult.
- Everything's a challenge.

834
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:19,637
- Through adversity...
- ...to the stars!

835
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:21,636
From the last plane,
to the last bullet,

836
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:23,558
to the last minute, to
the last man, we fight!

837
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,010
We fight!

838
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:26,219
We fight!

839
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,512
Anybody got eyes
on the bombers?

840
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,222
Uh...

841
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:34,522
We are all by our lonesome, Red One.
Think we screwed up.

842
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:38,978
Right on target, and according to
my reckoning, 32 seconds early.

843
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,604
We're here.
They're not.

844
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,148
Maybe the bombers turned back.

845
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,367
Damn! Maybe they
went on without us.

846
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,537
Red One, there they are.

847
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,410
Nine o'clock low.

848
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,042
Junior, head on over
to the bomber leader.

849
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,581
<i>Let him know we're friendlies.</i>

850
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,041
Roger that.

851
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,714
Bogies! Three high.

852
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,094
<i>Everybody, on your guns.</i>

853
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:12,678
<i>Counting close to 70 chicks.
We got one coming down.</i>

854
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,524
Hold your fire.
They're ours.

855
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:21,478
Red tails? I don't
recognize the markings.

856
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,738
He's colored.

857
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,152
Yeah, right.

858
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,233
Hell if I'm joking!
Look.

859
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,239
Jesus Christ. They
can't all be colored.

860
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:35,041
One fighter group of all Negro pilots?
I don't believe it!

861
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,916
What the hell do we do?

862
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:42,132
Tacoma One to all planes.
Everybody's eyes open.

863
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,795
<i>I don't think
our fighter escort</i>

864
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,343
<i>is gonna be much
help this trip.</i>

865
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:56,771
Flying Fortresses!
At least a hundred!

866
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:02,019
Decoy Squadron, move in
and draw off those fighters.

867
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,867
Fighters, four o'clock.

868
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,362
They're not attacking.
Let them go.

869
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,492
Let them go?

870
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:15,741
Our orders are to
stay with the bombers.

871
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,664
Uh. What? What?
You're breaking up.

872
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:22,623
You heard Colonel Bullard. Forget
the prize, save the lives.

873
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:25,087
God, I hate this war.

874
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:30,130
Look at that. Those Red
Tails are staying put.

875
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,719
They're giving up
glory to save our asses.

876
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:35,556
We'll have to do
this the hard way...

877
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:36,724
...Break!

878
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:45,111
Here we go, Lightning.

879
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,233
Right behind you.

880
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,453
Where'd this jackass come from?

881
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,085
Get out of there, Lightning!
Come on, get out of there!

882
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:08,089
Don't you worry about me.
I'm just playing with him.

883
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:11,589
Stop fooling around!
Damn it, I'm coming.

884
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:13,010
<i>No, you're not.
Stay put.</i>

885
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,887
I'm gonna show him
a little trick I learned.

886
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:29,568
Whoo! Ha-ha!

887
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:34,077
Lightning, when are you gonna
learn this is not a game?

888
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,574
Coming up on
anti-aircraft guns.

889
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:43,707
Back off! We'll get
'em on the way back...

890
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:44,871
Break! Break!

891
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,179
Those Jerries are
hightailing it out of here.

892
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:57,634
Flak's getting thick.

893
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:00,687
Break off. Circle clear of the
flak until the bombers return.

894
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,267
Good luck, bombardiers!

895
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:26,455
All bombs away! Let's get
the hell out of here.

896
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,300
Here they come.
Form up.

897
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:36,343
Move in...

898
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,469
...Concentrate
on the stragglers!

899
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,476
Hey, Junior! You got
a bandit on your left!

900
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:44,931
Get out of there.
I'll take him.

901
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:47,351
<i>Junior, get out of there!</i>

902
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:49,068
Where is he?
I can't see him!

903
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,153
Ah!

904
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:57,819
Junior, where are you?
Are you all right?

905
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:59,446
I'm all right!

906
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,455
<i>Junior, you're on fire!</i>

907
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:04,167
Junior, get out of the plane!

908
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:05,619
Junior!

909
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,173
Come on, Junior, bail!

910
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,468
Geronimo!

911
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,332
We didn't lose a single plane.

912
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,293
Well, that's a first.

913
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:56,419
Red One, Deke's trailing fuel!

914
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,213
Don't look good.

915
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,758
Deke, talk to me.
What's your status?

916
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,177
I'm all right.

917
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:08,106
I got gas spraying everywhere,
but I think I'm gonna be okay.

918
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:12,610
I'm a little dizzy, but
other than that, I'm fine.

919
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,528
All right, listen up.

920
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:18,028
I'll give escort to Deke
. Everybody else head back to base.

921
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:20,034
No, I'll stay. I'm his wingman.
I'll stay.

922
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:23,155
Let me take him, Easy.
God, I hate this mask!

923
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:25,869
It's my call, Lightning.

924
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,458
Your calls have been
a little off lately.

925
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:30,370
What? What are you
talking about?

926
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,879
Junior shouldn't
have been up here.

927
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:35,208
You got a problem with the
way I'm running this squad,

928
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,134
you talk to Bullard
about it, all right?

929
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,928
Until then, I'm in control.

930
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:41,472
And my order for you right now
is to head back to base.

931
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,058
Damn!

932
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,387
All right, Deke,
you'll be all right.

933
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:48,687
I'll see you back at the ranch.

934
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:50,231
You got Black Jesus
with you, boy!

935
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,892
Thanks, Smokey.

936
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:02,743
Well, get me home, Easy.

937
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,404
No, sir. You're going
to get yourself home.

938
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:11,628
What the hell put the Captain
in such a bad mood?

939
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:13,956
He gets like that sometimes.

940
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:16,791
He knows good and well he
shouldn't have let Junior fly.

941
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:17,921
That boy was half blind.

942
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:21,846
We're almost home.

943
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:24,219
I hope we meet up with
those Red Tails next time.

944
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:27,389
Listen, boys, the bombers
have passed their safe point.

945
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:30,104
Our mission is over.
Let's head back to base.

946
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:44,159
You guys are
taking the long way.

947
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:47,114
I'm going to take a
shortcut down the coast.

948
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:49,866
Come on now, Lightning. Ain't
no need to get all crazy.

949
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:51,201
You know you got to stay
with your squadron.

950
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:54,709
You stay with the slow-ass squadron.
I'm running low on fuel.

951
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,922
And what if you
turn up missing?

952
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:58,921
Then I'll have to
break it to Major Stance.

953
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,752
Well, break it to him gently.

954
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:02,462
<i>Great, great, great!</i>

955
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,301
One's a drunk,
and the other one

956
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,053
does whatever
the hell he wants to do.

957
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:08,055
Smokey, stay with him.

958
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:09,678
<i>And keep him out of trouble.</i>

959
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,138
Don't worry.
I'll stick with him.

960
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:19,813
My head, it hurts.

961
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:22,148
We're almost there, Deke.

962
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:23,733
Stay with me.

963
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:31,329
Easy, I got blood all over
me, but I'm not bleeding.

964
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,289
<i>You're gonna be okay.
I'm right above you.</i>

965
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:37,796
Captain,
I'm getting real dizzy.

966
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:40,166
I need to rest a minute.

967
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,345
No, no. Stay alert, Deke.
I'm here with you.

968
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:47,048
I can't really see anything!

969
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:51,019
Everything's all blurred!
I got double vision.

970
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:55,516
You're slipping, Deke! Deke,
you're slipping! Steady up!

971
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:58,859
All right.

972
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,483
All right.

973
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:15,039
You're diving, Deke. You need
to pull back on your stick.

974
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,539
<i>Pull up, Deke, pull up!</i>

975
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,422
Deke, listen to me! Pull
back on your stick now!

976
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,633
<i>Pull up, Deke, pull up!</i>

977
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:27,964
Pull up?

978
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:32,139
Oh, I'm pulling up!
I'm pulling up!

979
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:34,391
Come on!

980
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:41,227
I must have passed out!

981
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,451
I need you to stay with me, okay?
Stay with me.

982
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:49,735
<i>Just keep talking.</i>

983
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:50,911
All right.

984
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:07,796
Lightning, look! German
destroyer, moving to the north!

985
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:14,310
I still got ammo.
How about you?

986
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:18,765
Nah. You need about a 500-pound
bomb to put a dent in that thing.

987
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:22,234
Plus, that baby got very,
very big guns.

988
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,608
Just watch me.

989
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,614
Lightning, no, all right?
Don't be crazy.

990
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:30,743
If the big guns don't kill you,
your plane will get messed up,

991
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:32,616
<i>and Coffee is gonna kill you.</i>

992
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:36,116
Relax, Smokey. Worrying
too much will kill you.

993
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:06,605
All right! That was fun! Okay,
come on now, time to go home.

994
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,151
Just one more pass.

995
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:21,911
How do you like
that, Mr. Hitler?

996
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:25,131
Lightning, you a damn fool!
But I love you! Come on.

997
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:38,390
Ramitelli to Subsoil Red One.
Do you read?

998
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,847
<i>I got Red Four
with me, he's busted up pretty bad.</i>

999
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,855
Stay alert, Deke.
Stay alert.

1000
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:48,483
Ramitelli, have
a fire truck standing by.

1001
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:50,815
He's leaking fuel. I
repeat, he's leaking fuel.

1002
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,407
This is Major Stance.

1003
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:58,490
Circle a half-mile out
and have Red Four bail.

1004
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,582
Flight surgeons
will be there waiting.

1005
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:01,705
<i>Copy that.</i>

1006
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:05,671
You're gonna put it
into a left bank,

1007
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,214
and you're up and out.
All right?

1008
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,719
I can't get the canopy open!

1009
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,173
Easy!

1010
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,762
Listen, Deke,
the only thing between

1011
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:19,435
you living and dying
is that canopy.

1012
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:20,636
Now, get it open!

1013
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,605
I can't open it!

1014
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:26,600
I can't open it!

1015
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,481
Red Four cannot
open his canopy.

1016
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:30,484
I repeat,
he cannot open his canopy.

1017
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:31,985
I'm gonna have to bring him in.

1018
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,237
Roger that.

1019
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:39,239
Sweet Jesus,

1020
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:42,075
don't let this happen to me.

1021
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,333
Okay. Okay.

1022
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,835
<i>All right, Deke.
Flaps down.</i>

1023
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:50,465
Flaps down.

1024
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:55,595
There you go.

1025
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:02,929
Level off, level off!

1026
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:06,106
I'm leveling.

1027
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:09,310
Help me, sir.
I'm covered in fuel!

1028
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:11,478
I'm coming around
behind you, Deke.

1029
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:17,701
All right,
now get your gear down.

1030
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:29,459
Easy! I think I'm
coming in too hot!

1031
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:33,592
I don't want to die!
I'm not ready!

1032
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:36,420
Just relax.
Level off, Deke.

1033
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:42,142
Too fast.
I'm going too fast!

1034
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,391
Nose up! Nose up!

1035
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:48,227
Come on!

1036
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:54,438
Drop your throttle!
Nose down!

1037
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:55,864
<i>Nose down!</i>

1038
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:58,989
No! No!

1039
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:19,262
Shit!

1040
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:35,020
Deke!

1041
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:02,214
Smoke cloud on the left.

1042
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:08,684
You don't think
that's Deke, do you?

1043
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,887
Who was it?
Deke.

1044
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:44,594
It was Deke.

1045
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:47,138
Oh, shit.
An engine fire.

1046
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,557
Gas leak must have
caught on the landing.

1047
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:51,730
But I talked to the medics, they
said he's gonna be all right.

1048
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:53,102
Must have been a spark.

1049
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:54,649
What?

1050
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,233
You've been drinking.

1051
01:20:58,437 --> 01:20:59,563
You're going to
blame this on me?

1052
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,114
Tell me you haven't
been drinking.

1053
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:02,858
I got him down!
Say it!

1054
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:06,445
I got him down alive! You
don't blame this on me!

1055
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,538
I did everything I could do!

1056
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,867
Joe! Joe!

1057
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,129
All back, Colonel.

1058
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:09,683
The good news is Lieutenant Watkins
survived the fireball landing.

1059
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,268
He's in critical.

1060
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,016
Do they think
he's gonna make it?

1061
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:14,389
Yes, sir.

1062
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:19,023
With 60% third-degree burns.
We're sending him back home.

1063
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:25,233
I brought the background on the
captured flyer, Lieutenant Ray Gannon.

1064
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:28,744
His mother's name is Dorothy.
Father is Thomas.

1065
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:32,491
His wife's name is Thelma. They
have a little girl, Adele.

1066
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,375
In particular,
Ray loved to fly.

1067
01:22:36,326 --> 01:22:39,921
More than any pilot we have,
he loved to be in the air.

1068
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:05,694
You must be Lt. Gannon.

1069
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:07,866
Welcome to Stalag 18.

1070
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:12,454
You're the first of
your kind we've had here.

1071
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:16,162
I hope your stay
will not be cut short.

1072
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:33,971
Here is the new prisoner
your captain requested,

1073
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:35,969
Lieutenant Ray Gannon.

1074
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:39,519
A pilot with the 332nd.

1075
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,477
Where the hell
did you come from?

1076
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,399
Lieutenant!

1077
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,115
Sit down.

1078
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:04,377
So, I bet you're wondering why
I picked you to bunk with us.

1079
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:07,881
It's not something
I care to think about.

1080
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:10,925
Don't worry.

1081
01:24:11,338 --> 01:24:13,591
It's not so we can
hang you or anything.

1082
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:17,019
I chose you because I know
you can't be a German spy,

1083
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,434
being colored and all.

1084
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:22,065
We're in the middle of a
rather delicate operation,

1085
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,393
and we don't need
any new white faces.

1086
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:27,355
You'll be treated no differently
than any other man here.

1087
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,278
Any problems, you tell me.

1088
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:38,241
Come on! Let's go!
Move, move, move!

1089
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:41,168
Line it up! Let's go!

1090
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:47,674
I welcome you to the 332nd Fighter Group.
You're a long way from home.

1091
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,088
Jerry's going down!

1092
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:54,468
I'm telling you,
Lightning sunk it.

1093
01:24:54,548 --> 01:24:57,017
That is a destroyer.
Shit, Lightning's crazy!

1094
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:03,686
Here it comes!

1095
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:05,021
Whoo!

1096
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:07,853
I came around for a second pass.
Watch this.

1097
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,828
We fight! We fight!

1098
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:19,201
We fight! We fight! We fight!

1099
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:20,763
Mmm.

1100
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:32,900
My best friend.

1101
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:35,358
He...

1102
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:39,661
He almost caused the death
of one of our pilots.

1103
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,208
I don't know what to do.

1104
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,883
I am so glad I found you.

1105
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:33,002
I want you to stop, Easy.

1106
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:35,129
Stop what?

1107
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:36,676
You can't drink on duty.

1108
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:38,754
I told you, what happened to
Deke wasn't my fault, all right?

1109
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:40,839
No one cares what you do
when you're in town.

1110
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:42,174
How you relax is your business.

1111
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:43,767
This coming from
a guy who flies

1112
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:46,186
like he has got some
kind of death wish.

1113
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:47,763
You're a piece of work, Joe.

1114
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:49,689
You ignore me up there,
then all of a sudden,

1115
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:51,108
you expect me to
listen to you down here.

1116
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:53,026
All right, all right, all right.

1117
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:59,195
Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

1118
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:03,536
You promise to
ditch the bottle,

1119
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:06,494
I'll promise to fly right.

1120
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:10,664
And follow my orders.

1121
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,585
And follow your orders.

1122
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:22,134
Happy?

1123
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:24,094
Very happy.

1124
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,442
I can't wait to
hear her sweet singing!

1125
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:45,780
You guys can go chase skirt.
I'm going to Sofia's.

1126
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,245
What did you
say, about three miles?

1127
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:50,834
Odds of us getting pinched?

1128
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:52,911
I won't even take that action.

1129
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:54,587
Hey, flyboys!

1130
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:57,500
That trouble. Keep walking.
Come on.

1131
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:59,129
Don't just walk away from me.

1132
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:00,927
He picked the wrong day.
Let's go.

1133
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:04,590
Hey, come over here!

1134
01:29:08,635 --> 01:29:09,761
What?

1135
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:12,434
You guys.

1136
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:15,851
You're the Red Tails, right?

1137
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:22,116
You know, Red Tails?
Colored boy flyers?

1138
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:26,700
Well, I wouldn't necessarily say
it like that, but who's asking?

1139
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:29,831
Chester Barnes,
98th Bomb Group.

1140
01:29:29,948 --> 01:29:33,077
You guys flew a little top cover
for us about a month ago.

1141
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:35,287
A little run over Ploiesti?

1142
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,044
It was the best goddamn flying
I've ever seen, gentlemen.

1143
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:42,173
And we guys, well, we feel that
we owe all you boys a drink.

1144
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:46,131
Why don't you come and join us?
Come on.

1145
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:51,891
Come and join them?

1146
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:53,639
What's he saying?

1147
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,687
Come on.
Drinks are on us.

1148
01:29:57,434 --> 01:29:59,232
Well, I'll be damned.

1149
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:02,739
I guess the dance hall
will have to wait.

1150
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,072
How you doing?
Much obliged.

1151
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:15,085
<i>He was a famous trumpet man
from out Chicago way.</i>

1152
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,754
<i>He had a boogie style
that no one else could play.</i>

1153
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:20,332
<i>He was the top man at his craft.</i>

1154
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,385
<i>But then his number came up
and he was gone with the draft.</i>

1155
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:26,338
<i>He's in the army now
a-blowin' reveille.</i>

1156
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:29,425
<i>He's the boogie woogie
bugle boy of Company B.</i>

1157
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:32,306
<i>They made him blow a bugle
for his Uncle Sam.</i>

1158
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:35,059
<i>It really brought him down
because he couldn't jam.</i>

1159
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:37,607
<i>The captain seemed
to understand.</i>

1160
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:39,776
All right, boys, listen up!

1161
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:43,029
These fellas are the Red Tails.

1162
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:45,857
They're the guys who have
been giving us an escort.

1163
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:49,365
First drink is on me, fellas.
Whatever you'd like.

1164
01:30:54,324 --> 01:30:56,201
Hanson, Travis J.

1165
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,786
Samuel George.

1166
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:01,586
Me and the boys over here
are with the 463rd Bomb Group.

1167
01:31:01,665 --> 01:31:02,757
Glad to meet you, man.

1168
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:06,553
You flew with us over Brux
. Appreciate you getting us home.

1169
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:14,391
Hey, have you guys run into
any of those new jet pursuit fighters?

1170
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:16,179
We haven't been that lucky.

1171
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,356
Well, we've been that unlucky.

1172
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:22,402
Those babies go so fast
you can't even see them.

1173
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:33,781
You know,

1174
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:36,161
we say "colored."

1175
01:31:36,241 --> 01:31:40,417
But that's not what you prefer?

1176
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:42,706
No, no.
The word is...

1177
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:44,041
"Negro."

1178
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:50,673
When you get upset, when you
get mad, you turn red, right?

1179
01:31:51,089 --> 01:31:54,389
When you get envious or
sick, you turn green.

1180
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:57,645
When you become cowardly,
you turn yellow.

1181
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:00,600
And y'all got the nerve
to call us colored.

1182
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:38,767
I want to ask you
an important question.

1183
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,221
Um...

1184
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:13,589
Will you marry me?

1185
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:24,974
Uh...

1186
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:31,238
Time to think.

1187
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:34,863
Oh.

1188
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:39,656
Okay.

1189
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:50,796
When you get to
the other side, don't wait.

1190
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,718
Just run for the woods, okay?
Go!

1191
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:55,589
Remember, run for the woods!

1192
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,133
It's Ray Gun, he's
back with the batteries.

1193
01:33:58,216 --> 01:33:59,468
Any problems?

1194
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:01,219
They won't even
know they're missing.

1195
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:04,310
Divide the batteries among
those who have flashlights.

1196
01:34:04,389 --> 01:34:06,107
You've been
a great help, Ray Gun.

1197
01:34:06,182 --> 01:34:09,277
I guess there's a lot more to
you coloreds than I thought.

1198
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:12,864
We want you to travel with us.

1199
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:18,074
Oh, I can't. I'll stick out
like a pig in a poultry shop.

1200
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:20,197
I'll draw attention
to you guys.

1201
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,202
Thank you.

1202
01:34:22,574 --> 01:34:24,542
I'll go alone.
But...

1203
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:28,505
Here, take my dog tags.

1204
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:30,665
Get them back to my unit.

1205
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:35,049
You're a wily sucker, Ray. At least
they won't see you in the dark.

1206
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,797
Good luck, Lieutenant.

1207
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:40,724
Safe journey, Captain.
Good luck, Ray.

1208
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,143
Good luck.

1209
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:46,518
Remember, run for the woods.

1210
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:48,441
Okay, let's go.

1211
01:35:35,355 --> 01:35:37,153
- Run, Miller, run!
- Halt!

1212
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:40,985
Halt!

1213
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:42,324
Halt, halt!

1214
01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:54,842
<i>Hot tamales, and they're red
hot Yes, she got them for sale.</i>

1215
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:57,293
<i>I got a girl,
she's long and tall.</i>

1216
01:35:57,377 --> 01:35:59,675
<i>Sleeps in the kitchen
with her feets in the hall.</i>

1217
01:36:00,255 --> 01:36:02,883
Sticks on metal ain't music.
It ain't.

1218
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:04,509
I like music.

1219
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:07,933
Aww! Coffee, were you
always mean as hell,

1220
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:09,855
or you just get like
that with old age?

1221
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:13,401
I once was a happy man. Never did
not have a smile on my face.

1222
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:15,774
That was before you guys started
tearing up my beautiful planes.

1223
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:18,656
I could tolerate
the P-40s.

1224
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:21,985
But these new babies getting beat up?
It breaks my heart.

1225
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:26,369
Come on, Coffee. I only came
back with two holes this time.

1226
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:28,874
Uh. Six.
Six holes.

1227
01:36:29,575 --> 01:36:31,953
Well, that ain't nothing compared
to what's gonna happen to you

1228
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:35,290
when you run into those jets those
bomber jockeys was talking about.

1229
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:36,920
I ain't afraid of no jets.

1230
01:36:37,709 --> 01:36:39,928
Don't go trying your
old tricks, Lightning.

1231
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:42,131
If you end up too close
behind one of those jets,

1232
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:44,432
the turbulence alone will blow your
black ass right out of the sky.

1233
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:46,388
Trust me, I'm gonna
be the first one

1234
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:47,844
to shoot one of
those things down.

1235
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:49,144
And I'll be the second.

1236
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:52,190
My advice is, you see
one, run like hell.

1237
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:54,646
The only thing in life that
makes me want to run like hell

1238
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:56,194
is you, Coffee.

1239
01:36:59,147 --> 01:37:02,367
That's gonna get you killed out there.
I'm not dancing with you.

1240
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:07,410
The target is a tank factory
on the outskirts of Berlin.

1241
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:13,666
Shut that down, you shut down Jerry's
ability to shore up a Berlin defense.

1242
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:17,461
General Campbell's wing will
be leading the bombardment.

1243
01:37:17,623 --> 01:37:19,751
You have recon on the area?

1244
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:22,462
In the air, we're expecting
everything the Luftwaffe's got,

1245
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:24,513
100s, 109s, 190s.

1246
01:37:25,506 --> 01:37:28,430
A possibility of 262s,
German jet fighters.

1247
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:29,886
Jet fighters?

1248
01:37:30,011 --> 01:37:31,263
The boys are
gonna love this one!

1249
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:35,725
The target area
isn't your concern.

1250
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:40,530
The 52nd will escort the
General's planes into Berlin.

1251
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:43,991
Is there a reason, sir?

1252
01:37:44,067 --> 01:37:46,320
Sixteen hundred miles
to Berlin and back.

1253
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:48,905
The fighters need
to take it in stages.

1254
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:51,992
With external fuel tanks,
the 51s can make it.

1255
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:53,827
I guarantee our pilots can.

1256
01:37:54,035 --> 01:37:56,914
I'd prefer the Red Tails take the
leg where we need protecting.

1257
01:37:57,497 --> 01:38:00,341
Our first major air
offensive over Berlin.

1258
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:03,882
From a propaganda
point of view,

1259
01:38:04,337 --> 01:38:06,886
a lot of attention gonna be paid
to this and a lot of ink spilled.

1260
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:10,306
And Negro pilots aren't
part of that story.

1261
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:14,305
Colonel, A.J.

1262
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:18,935
This is coming
from way above me.

1263
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:21,441
If you didn't have my respect,

1264
01:38:21,521 --> 01:38:24,320
I wouldn't be talking
to you face to face.

1265
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:28,407
But we don't win this
war, all my regard,

1266
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:31,365
everything that you and
your men have done,

1267
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:35,159
none of it means a thing.

1268
01:38:43,876 --> 01:38:45,128
Colonel.

1269
01:38:45,962 --> 01:38:49,262
Please see to it that the
General gets to his plane.

1270
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:51,016
Sir.

1271
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:02,562
You like it?

1272
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:13,532
I want you

1273
01:39:14,323 --> 01:39:16,701
stay in Italia.

1274
01:39:19,537 --> 01:39:21,289
You want me to stay?

1275
01:39:25,084 --> 01:39:26,711
Does that mean...

1276
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:29,301
Does that mean you'll marry me?

1277
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:33,184
Yes. Marriage.

1278
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:42,102
I love you.

1279
01:39:46,856 --> 01:39:48,574
I can't believe it.

1280
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:54,322
I'm getting married.

1281
01:40:01,162 --> 01:40:04,632
Okay, we're going to throw it, all right?
There you go.

1282
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:08,261
There you go. All right. Throw!

1283
01:40:29,315 --> 01:40:31,613
I'm looking for Captain Julian.

1284
01:40:32,235 --> 01:40:33,612
Right here.

1285
01:40:36,822 --> 01:40:38,950
You the one they call Easy?

1286
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:42,120
I guess some people do.
What can I help you with?

1287
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:46,132
I'm Captain Miller. I was in
prison with Lieutenant Gannon.

1288
01:40:46,749 --> 01:40:49,298
He asked me to
give his tags to you.

1289
01:40:53,297 --> 01:40:54,674
Four of us got out.

1290
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:57,226
The deal was, if we
made it and he didn't,

1291
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:59,303
I'd get his dog tags
back to his unit.

1292
01:41:01,681 --> 01:41:03,433
Ray was a good man.

1293
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:07,312
To whoever it matters,
you tell them from me.

1294
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:10,152
Ray was the best
soldier I ever met.

1295
01:41:11,774 --> 01:41:13,117
Thank you.

1296
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:32,758
A moment, Colonel.

1297
01:41:35,256 --> 01:41:37,008
What is it, Captain?

1298
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:43,140
Ray Gannon's dog tags, sir.

1299
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:47,940
A soldier brought it by today.

1300
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:50,147
He and Ray were
prisoners together.

1301
01:41:51,105 --> 01:41:53,733
They got out from
under the Germans,

1302
01:41:55,067 --> 01:41:56,990
but Ray didn't make it.

1303
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:06,375
Sir, Ray Gun wasn't fit when
I put him back in rotation.

1304
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:08,373
The Flight Surgeon
wouldn't clean bill him,

1305
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:11,630
so I talked my way
right past him.

1306
01:42:16,255 --> 01:42:19,885
I just don't feel like I'm fit
to lead the squad any more.

1307
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:24,521
I've made so many mistakes.

1308
01:42:24,597 --> 01:42:27,191
No, you've made
one big mistake.

1309
01:42:27,266 --> 01:42:30,486
That self-pity of yours,
that's your weakness.

1310
01:42:30,853 --> 01:42:33,276
But it ends right here,
right now.

1311
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:36,776
You man up,
you lead your squad.

1312
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:42,282
Every decision that you make isn't
gonna always be the right one.

1313
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:53,459
All right, this is it.

1314
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:57,305
For the first time, the bombers
are going all the way to Berlin.

1315
01:42:57,838 --> 01:43:01,968
They'll be up against 109s and
262s the new jet fighters.

1316
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:12,187
Unfortunately, we're only
going to escort them

1317
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:14,271
on the first leg
of their mission,

1318
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:16,107
so I don't expect
you'll see much action.

1319
01:43:16,774 --> 01:43:19,869
You will rendezvous with the
relief escorts at 0830.

1320
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:23,952
I know this is disappointing to you.
It's not the job you wanted.

1321
01:43:24,615 --> 01:43:26,617
But those are your orders.

1322
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:28,711
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

1323
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:32,173
Full briefing at 0400.
On the flight line at 0530.

1324
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:33,374
Spread the word, gentlemen.

1325
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:35,797
Julian. A moment.

1326
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,053
Captain, if your relief
doesn't arrive,

1327
01:43:45,136 --> 01:43:47,389
as squadron leader,
it's your call.

1328
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:49,644
If you think you can make it.

1329
01:43:50,516 --> 01:43:51,608
Sir.

1330
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:53,686
That is all, son.

1331
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:40,528
We're past
the rendezvous point.

1332
01:44:40,608 --> 01:44:42,906
Tail gunner, has the
52nd squadron arrived?

1333
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:45,450
No, sir.
No sign of them.

1334
01:44:45,821 --> 01:44:47,869
Anybody got eyes on
our relief fighters?

1335
01:44:48,199 --> 01:44:50,201
Not a dang thing, Red One.

1336
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:52,787
Are we going all the way, sir?

1337
01:44:52,912 --> 01:44:55,040
Fuel-wise,
we're looking good.

1338
01:44:55,372 --> 01:44:57,466
But I'm guessing
the hours there and back,

1339
01:44:57,541 --> 01:45:00,090
it'll definitely be
one for the record books.

1340
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:03,176
Come on, Easy.
It's Berlin.

1341
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,302
Let's go.
We can make it.

1342
01:45:11,222 --> 01:45:15,318
All right, gentlemen. Brace yourselves.
We're going the distance.

1343
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:17,732
Yeah! We fight!

1344
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:20,857
Ha-ha! Watch out,
Hitler, here we come!

1345
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:24,114
Just remember, we're here
to protect the bombers.

1346
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:27,159
Under all circumstances,
we stay on mission.

1347
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:31,250
What's that about?

1348
01:45:31,408 --> 01:45:34,628
I think we've got the Red
Tails for the duration.

1349
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:45,051
By my reckoning,
we're deep into Germany.

1350
01:45:45,130 --> 01:45:47,383
It's a little creepy we haven't
seen any fighters yet.

1351
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:51,345
Maybe they found out
we were flying escort

1352
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:53,476
and decided not to show up.

1353
01:45:53,722 --> 01:45:55,224
That'd be nice.

1354
01:45:55,307 --> 01:45:57,526
Wouldn't mind that,
would you, baby?

1355
01:46:05,818 --> 01:46:08,321
Colonel!
It's from Mission Control.

1356
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:11,202
The 52nd didn't
make the rendezvous.

1357
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:12,625
They didn't join
up with the 5th.

1358
01:46:13,742 --> 01:46:15,289
Did our boys turn back?

1359
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:17,329
No, sir. They're
headed on to Berlin.

1360
01:46:17,955 --> 01:46:20,333
I gave Captain Julian
the option.

1361
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:24,341
Headquarters wants to know
if we're gonna call them back.

1362
01:46:25,129 --> 01:46:26,381
Yes, sir!

1363
01:46:48,444 --> 01:46:49,787
Show no mercy.

1364
01:46:57,453 --> 01:46:59,376
Oh, shit! Jets!
We got jets!

1365
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,001
What the hell?

1366
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:06,678
What? Oh, no!

1367
01:47:13,093 --> 01:47:14,345
Maurice!

1368
01:47:14,595 --> 01:47:15,687
<i>Mama!</i>

1369
01:47:16,764 --> 01:47:18,016
<i>Break! Break! Break!</i>

1370
01:47:18,515 --> 01:47:19,687
<i>Here we go.</i>

1371
01:47:28,192 --> 01:47:29,819
Nine o'clock low!

1372
01:47:31,654 --> 01:47:32,826
I see them.

1373
01:47:36,825 --> 01:47:37,917
We're losing them!

1374
01:47:38,410 --> 01:47:41,710
I got the throttle wide open!
They're too damn fast!

1375
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,753
Son of a bitch!
Those babies are gone.

1376
01:47:54,218 --> 01:47:55,845
I'm losing power!

1377
01:47:56,053 --> 01:47:57,521
Stay left!
I'll get him!

1378
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:04,270
This is for Maurice!

1379
01:48:08,273 --> 01:48:09,525
Yeah!

1380
01:48:11,568 --> 01:48:13,787
Brilliant!
Smokey, brilliant!

1381
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:26,125
Easy, we got one
crossing in front of us.

1382
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:27,923
Start firing,
he'll fly right into it.

1383
01:48:28,085 --> 01:48:29,382
I know.
I got him.

1384
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:37,852
These jets ain't nothing.

1385
01:48:37,928 --> 01:48:39,225
<i>We need more speed.</i>

1386
01:48:39,304 --> 01:48:40,772
Let's get some altitude.

1387
01:48:51,984 --> 01:48:53,452
Easy, right there!
Ten o'clock!

1388
01:48:56,488 --> 01:48:57,956
I got him!

1389
01:49:05,956 --> 01:49:07,799
Now that's how it's done!

1390
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,643
Smokey! Smokey!

1391
01:49:19,845 --> 01:49:22,064
I'm all right.
I'm all right!

1392
01:49:23,849 --> 01:49:26,147
I'll be damned!
They missed me!

1393
01:49:26,351 --> 01:49:28,900
No holes in me, baby!
Whoo! Come on.

1394
01:49:35,486 --> 01:49:36,658
Now we're losing
power on engine four.

1395
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:39,240
That's it for us, guys.
We're turning around.

1396
01:49:46,705 --> 01:49:48,707
We got a straggler.
Two o'clock.

1397
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:51,009
<i>Oh, I see him!</i>

1398
01:49:52,419 --> 01:49:54,842
I'm on it, Red One. We'll get
down there and cover him.

1399
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:04,602
Lightning, form up.
I'm going back.

1400
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:06,896
We got a crippled
bomber to protect.

1401
01:50:09,228 --> 01:50:12,072
Easy, you got Pretty Boy on your tail.
I'm coming around.

1402
01:50:12,147 --> 01:50:13,694
Where? I don't see him!

1403
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:16,326
Die, you...

1404
01:50:16,401 --> 01:50:17,402
...foolish African!

1405
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:20,330
Damn it!

1406
01:50:25,744 --> 01:50:27,121
I'm heading right for you!

1407
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:31,382
I've got him!
I've got him!

1408
01:50:32,209 --> 01:50:33,381
Get out of my way!

1409
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:34,712
What the hell are you doing?

1410
01:50:34,795 --> 01:50:36,263
Dive right now! Dive.

1411
01:50:50,561 --> 01:50:51,653
Whoo!

1412
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:56,742
That's the end of Pretty Boy!

1413
01:51:07,494 --> 01:51:09,496
Sure got him good!

1414
01:51:09,997 --> 01:51:11,874
Ha! You did it!

1415
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:13,709
You got that son of a bitch.

1416
01:51:15,711 --> 01:51:17,839
Did you say Lightning
shot down Pretty Boy?

1417
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:18,968
Whoo-hoo!

1418
01:51:19,047 --> 01:51:20,765
Give 'em hell, Lightning!

1419
01:51:20,841 --> 01:51:23,185
You just might be the best
pilot that ever lived!

1420
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:25,729
<i>Now get your ass back here
and help us with this bomber.</i>

1421
01:51:25,804 --> 01:51:28,557
<i>We're on our way back
to you, Joker.</i>

1422
01:51:35,105 --> 01:51:38,234
It was a crazy move. You
almost got yourself killed.

1423
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:42,954
<i>I think I did
get myself killed.</i>

1424
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:45,039
What are you talking about?

1425
01:51:47,117 --> 01:51:49,961
I don't think
I'm going to make it, Easy.

1426
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:53,961
What do you mean, you're
not going to make it?

1427
01:51:54,333 --> 01:51:56,210
<i>Don't talk like that!</i>

1428
01:51:57,127 --> 01:51:59,801
There's a lot...
There's a lot of blood.

1429
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:03,225
Listen to me.
Just hang in there.

1430
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:04,802
I'm gonna get you back,
all right?

1431
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:07,058
<i>Just stay focused.
I'm gonna help you.</i>

1432
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:12,734
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

1433
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:16,859
<i>Come on now. We've gotten out
of worse scrapes than this.</i>

1434
01:52:16,939 --> 01:52:20,193
I screwed up.

1435
01:52:20,275 --> 01:52:22,118
I don't care about that.
I'm right here with you.

1436
01:52:22,194 --> 01:52:24,788
We can do this together.
Come on.

1437
01:52:25,197 --> 01:52:26,323
Easy.

1438
01:52:28,951 --> 01:52:30,373
Gruesome Twosome.

1439
01:52:30,911 --> 01:52:33,664
Lightning!
Lightning, talk to me!

1440
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:35,875
Lightning, don't you
do this to me!

1441
01:52:35,958 --> 01:52:39,508
<i>Lightning?
Lightning, look at me!</i>

1442
01:52:40,295 --> 01:52:41,467
I love you.

1443
01:52:42,089 --> 01:52:44,091
I'm sorry, Sofia.

1444
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:04,654
Lightning, pull up!
Pull back on your stick!

1445
01:53:08,490 --> 01:53:10,993
Lightning, pop the canopy!
Pop the goddamn canopy!

1446
01:53:15,372 --> 01:53:17,045
Get out of the plane,
Lightning, that's an order!

1447
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:19,547
<i>Get out of the plane!</i>

1448
01:53:29,928 --> 01:53:31,930
Damn you, Lightning!

1449
01:53:39,271 --> 01:53:40,397
Easy.

1450
01:53:41,648 --> 01:53:42,740
Easy.

1451
01:53:47,404 --> 01:53:49,406
<i>Easy, do you read me?</i>

1452
01:53:51,783 --> 01:53:52,909
Easy!

1453
01:53:54,494 --> 01:53:56,087
Stay on mission!

1454
01:53:58,498 --> 01:53:59,920
Do you copy?

1455
01:54:03,003 --> 01:54:04,880
We need you back here.

1456
01:54:08,967 --> 01:54:10,310
We need you.

1457
01:54:11,762 --> 01:54:14,811
<i>For God's sake, tell me
you still out there.</i>

1458
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:17,268
I'm okay.
I'm on my way down.

1459
01:54:22,606 --> 01:54:23,903
Red One.

1460
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:26,903
Lightning's with you, right?

1461
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:36,578
Lieutenant Little is dead.

1462
01:55:24,876 --> 01:55:26,219
Lightning?

1463
01:56:36,573 --> 01:56:37,745
Marty?

1464
01:57:07,771 --> 01:57:10,445
The expectations
placed upon you men are high.

1465
01:57:11,483 --> 01:57:13,281
Lieutenant Little

1466
01:57:13,985 --> 01:57:16,158
exceeded those expectations.

1467
01:57:16,738 --> 01:57:19,287
We should not be
discouraged by his death,

1468
01:57:19,366 --> 01:57:22,290
but be all the more
encouraged by his life.

1469
01:57:23,203 --> 01:57:25,752
The acts of bravery by him

1470
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:27,707
will make us stronger.

1471
01:57:28,041 --> 01:57:30,885
It will inspire us
to fight harder,

1472
01:57:30,961 --> 01:57:33,305
to make this world free.

1473
01:57:33,755 --> 01:57:36,975
Because we are on the side
of God Almighty!

1474
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:39,390
Let us pray.

1475
01:57:40,971 --> 01:57:43,144
Hey! Hey, guys!

1476
01:57:47,269 --> 01:57:50,523
Hey! Guys!

1477
01:57:52,107 --> 01:57:54,656
I know you didn't
forget about me already!

1478
01:57:54,734 --> 01:57:56,862
I've been to hell and back,

1479
01:57:58,697 --> 01:58:01,325
so you will no longer
call me Junior.

1480
01:58:01,992 --> 01:58:07,089
From now on you will address
me as the fabulous Ray Gun.

1481
01:58:08,331 --> 01:58:09,674
How'd you do it, man?

1482
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:11,338
I'll be damned!

1483
01:58:15,964 --> 01:58:17,011
Ray!

1484
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:18,091
Ray Gun!

1485
01:58:18,174 --> 01:58:19,517
Boy, you look good.

1486
01:58:38,903 --> 01:58:42,203
<i>In the name of the
President of the United States,</i>
