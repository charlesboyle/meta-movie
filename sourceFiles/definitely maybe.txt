00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,015
Besides, we have a plan, right?

171
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,518
The other thing I can't believe is that
you'd risk Ieaving Emily here with me,

172
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:48,605
'cause I gotta tell you,
I've always had a thing for you...

173
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,734
And I have absolutely no scruples.

174
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,781
Wait! I almost forgot.
You have to give this to Summer.

175
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,158
She's the only girl I know in New York.

176
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,326
-I want you to meet her.
-Summer Hartley?

177
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,660
-Yes. Yes.
-That's her name?

178
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,454
She was on my exchange program
at Cambridge,

179
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,832
and all the guys wanted to sleep with her,
and you probably will, too.

180
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,083
Maybe you should mail it to her.

181
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,293
-That might be a better idea.
-No.

182
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,419
What is it?

183
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,797
Something I should have
sent her a long time ago.

184

make a good mom.

-WILLIAM: Why not?

MAYA: Everyone knows that the girlfriend

190
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,858
in the beginning of the story
always gets dumped.

191
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,236
Which means maybe
Summer Hartley is my mother.

192

WILLIAM: I'll never forget that day.

193
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,634

I always dreamed about

194
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,804
to work on a campaign
that I believed in with all of my heart.

195
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,391
And on top of that,
I was positive that in just a few hours,

196
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,435
the campaign manager would realize
how brilliant I was.

197
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,978

198
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,189

speeches I wrote for Congressman Sweeney.

so I can get a hold of you wherever,
whenever, for whatever.

WILLIAM: It was just one week
before the primary, and I had graduated

502
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,449

to signs and bumper stickers.

509
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:49,435
Just want to let everyone know
that the new signs are ready.

They're looking good.

511
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,314

for Congressman Sweeney.

How's high school?

514
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,987
He's from Texas. His name's George Bush.
But he is not the President.

515
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,115
Instead, he's the eldest son
of George and Barbara

516
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,534
and considered a key
political advisor of the White House.

Is it true you graduated first
of your class at Madison?

-Yeah.
-All right.

on Monday with 15 empty tables.

I can't have that, Hayes.
I need you to sell five of them.

-Okay.

-Look at that. Yeah.

that the Governor has a character problem,
Mrs. Perleman.

50% of Americans believe that

that the Vietnam War
was just a terrible idea?

Yes, I understand your concern,
but I think you should remember

00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,879
that the Governor comes from
a town called Hope.

And hope is exactly what he stands for, so...

555

No, no, I know it's corny, but I also think

556
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,766
that sometimes corny is exactly
what this country needs.

I'll put you down for one table, then.

for a pack of cigarettes?

-So those are healthy cigarettes.
-Something like that.

So if there's not as many chemicals in them,

587

they should cost less, not more,
don't you think?

588
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,163
They put saltpeter in your cigarettes,

589
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:40,708
which make them burn faster,
which make you smoke more.

590
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:46,339
Which means, at the end of the day,
your cigarettes actually cost more, not less.

what I think you're actually paying for

is the picture of the eagle
and the pretty pastel colors.

a hardcover copy of Jane Eyre.

about the earrings,

Good evening. Bill Clinton may have
been wounded in New York,

848
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,454
but the big question tonight is,
to what degree?

849
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,916
Because, after all, he is the big survivor,
indeed, the victor

She traveled all over the world,
just like she always dreamed of doing.

that it was because of something

scintilla of power and influence

to get Summer here
to write an article about your man Robredo?

and you get the word out.

-Yeah.

I didn't want Summer to be my mom.

'cause she was writing the article.

1168
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:28,656
I got you!

1169
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:31,700
I thought you were gone
through the summer.

1170
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:34,954
No, I thought so, too,
but this crazy thing happened.

1171
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:38,165
I mean, I was camping
on this beautiful beach in Crete

1172
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,794
with all these really cool people,
and there was this guy that I liked, Paco,

1173
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:45,214
brooding and sexy,
monosyllabic and totally my type.

1174
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:48,175
APRIL: One night I'm dancing with Paco
and he kisses me,

1175
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,844
-an incredible, deep kiss.
-WILLIAM: Spare me the details.

1176
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:53,347
And what do I do?
-I don't know. What'd you do?

1177
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:54,682
I start crying.

1178
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,184
-I mean, tears are rolling down my cheeks...
-Of course you start crying.

1179
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:00,729
...which he doesn't notice 'cause, of course,
his hands are all over my body,

1180
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:03,357
which felt nice,
which made me feel even more upset,

1181
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,025
'cause in a flash

1182
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:08,779
I saw our entire relationship,
from present to future tense.

1183
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:13,701
I mean, the incredibly hot start, with Paco
basking in my love and admiration...

1184
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:16,287
-What are we doing here?
-I just got to pick something up.

1185
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:17,413
Just take a second.

1186
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:20,332
And then the inevitable moment,
and I don't know why it...

1187
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,709
-Hello.
-Hi.

1188
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:24,336
I don't know why it happens,
but it always does,

1189
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,672
when all that love and admiration
would start to irritate him

1190
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,882
and he'd find some way to hurt me.

1191
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,510
I mean, sure, after, he'd be sorry.

1192
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:33,220
So...

1193
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:37,182
I decided to unlock his beautiful lips
from mine,

1194
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:39,393
remove his hand from my ass,

1195
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,478
(LAUGHS)

1196
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:45,274
-and I walked away.
-Good move.

1197
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,068
-I walked away, Will! From Paco!
-Good move.

1198
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:50,654
-No one walks away from Paco!
-I like the story.

1199
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:52,990
And it felt life-changing.

1200
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,367
And I realized I had to tell someone.

1201
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,453
When I realized who that person was,

1202
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:59,538
-it was so unexpected.
-MAN: Here we are, sir.

1203
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,415
It's like when something is staring you
in the face

1204
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:04,543
and it's like you're too blind to see it.

1205
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:05,919
What's that?

1206
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,215
I have some news for you, too.

1207
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,598
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why are you so upset?

1208
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:20,684
Don't you think it's a little weird we've been
writing each other for however long

1209
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:22,728
and somehow you neglect to tell me that,

1210
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:27,441
A, you've fallen in love,
and, B, you've fallen in love!

1211
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,109
-I told you I was dating someone.
-Dating someone.

1212
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,862
You just bought
a diamond engagement ring for someone!

1213
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,031
I'm sorry.
I think I was just nervous to tell you.

1214
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:36,742
Why would you be nervous to tell me?

1215
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,120
I don't know.

1216
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:42,665
I love this girl so much.

1217
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,752
I'd just really like you to be happy for me.

1218
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:51,632
I can be happy for you.
Of course I can be happy for you.

1219
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:56,929
MAYA: Poor April.

1220
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,474
She's like the character in the story
who's always been the friend.

1221
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,602
Then she realized
she doesn't just want to be the friend.

1222
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:06,647
She wants to be the girlfriend,
except it's too late.

1223
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,148
What do you mean?

1224
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:11,318
Weren't you listening?
She came home for you.

1225
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,535
GARETH: There's union seals
on all the menus, my friend.

1226
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:23,288
WILLIAM: The weather cleared in Chicago.
The President will be here by 8:00.

1227
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:24,498
Where's Russ?

1228
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,333
Gonna meet you and Arthur
in the restaurant.

1229
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:28,043
ROBERT KLEIN:
I'm funnier over here.

1230
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:30,003
(HARMONICA PLAYING)

1231
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,297
I can't stop my leg

1232
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:39,972
You're early.

1233
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,644
(MOANING)

1234
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:47,229
Good to see you.

1235
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,148
-You look great.
-Thank you. You, too.

1236
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:52,359
-That's a nice tie.
-Well, you'd know.

1237
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:57,448
So, the magazine asked me
to do a follow-up on Robredo.

1238
01:07:57,532 --> 01:08:00,534
-Great.
-Yeah, it is great. It's also...

1239
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,162
(SIGHING) It's...

1240
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,832
You just read it.

1241
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,709
-You already wrote it.
-Yeah.

1242
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:20,137
-He did this?
-Yes.

1243
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:24,641
They actually got a friend an early parole.

1244
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:29,396
You know what?
I think it happened such a long time ago,

1245
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,398
and you're way ahead in all the polls.

1246
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:36,153
Yeah, see, I don't think that's gonna matter,
because he's the tough-on-crime Democrat.

1247
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:37,696
That's...

1248
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:40,365
When people read this...

1249
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,953
Summer, listen to me.

1250
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:48,081
If you hand this in, we won't survive it.

1251
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:50,834
I think it'll be a big deal for about a week,
and then the storm will pass...

1252
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:53,128
I'm talking about you and me.

1253
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:58,217
"Candidate Brought Down
by Speechwriter's GirIfriend."

1254
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,886
-Come on.
-I'm just doing my job.

1255
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:04,473
I didn't do it the first time around.

1256
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:08,060
And if I didn't write this,
somebody else would.

1257
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,229
Let them.

1258
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:13,106
Hey, don't hand this in, okay?

1259
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:20,739
You already did.

1260
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:38,090
Mr. Arthur...

1261
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,383
(CHATTERING)

1262
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:40,926
ARTHUR: Yeah, sure.

1263
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,178
MAYA: I really liked Summer.

1264
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:45,097
I can't believe
she turned out to be such a...

1265
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,390
-Heartbreaker?
-No.

1266
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:48,767
-Opportunist? Double-crossing...
-Uh-uh.

1267
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:50,727
-Bitch.
-Maya.

1268
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:52,646
How could she do that to you?

1269
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:56,316
It's like she said. If she didn't write it,
someone else would have.

1270
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,943
And it was the truth.

1271
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,320
So did she? Did she break it?

1272
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:01,780
What?

1273
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:09,621
What happened when the article came out?

1274
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:29,474
You screwed up, man.
You really screwed up.

1275
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,268
Please save it.
I don't need to hear this right now.

1276
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,604
Whenever I figure out whatever
I'm supposed to learn from all this,

1277
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:35,981
-I'll write you a letter!
-Yeah, can't wait.

1278
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:41,194
WILLIAM: So I lost my girl,
I lost my job, and I lost my friend.

1279
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:45,866
And for a long time,
nothing seemed to matter.

1280
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,911
But I wasn't the only one with problems.

1281
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:53,832
I did not have
sexual relations with that woman,

1282
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:54,958
Miss Lewinsky.

1283
01:10:55,043 --> 01:10:56,084
(PHONE RINGING)

1284
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:57,502
I never told anybody to lie.

1285
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,338
-Hello?
-Are you watching?

1286
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:01,506
These allegations are false.

1287
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:02,674
April?

1288
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,678
Yeah, April. Who'd you think it was?
Are you watching or not?

1289
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,639
Of course I'm watching.

1290
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,183
You think he did it, don't you?

1291
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:15,896
I don't think, I know.
Look at the picture of her. I love her.

1292
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,856
She's so his type.

1293
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,986
So, what took you so long
to finally call me back there, red?

1294
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:24,738
I thought I lost you.

1295
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:28,867
-Feels like years.
-I'm calling you now, aren't I?

1296
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,036
Yeah.

1297
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,872
How are you? What's doing?

1298
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,041
I got a new roommate, Olivia.

1299
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:38,835
And I'm working at a bookstore.

1300
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:42,172
But I've been thinking about
going back to school.

1301
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,465
Cool.

1302
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,258
Hey, did I tell you that I hate my job?

1303
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:48,053
I used to love what I do,
and now I feel like a complete hack.

1304
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:53,809
-Are you seeing anyone?
-Me? Am I... No, no. Absolutely not.

1305
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:56,812
In fact, I haven't had sex
since Clinton was re-elected.

1306
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:59,898
APRIL: Why bother? He's having enough sex
for the entire country.

1307
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:01,984
WILLIAM: Easy. Easy now.

1308
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:05,362
APRIL: Hey, maybe you should
follow his lead and seduce an intern.

1309
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,739
WILLIAM: You know, it's funny
that you should mention that.

1310
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:11,702
There's a fetching young intern
who just started a week ago.

1311
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:13,578
APRIL: Great. Ask her out.

1312
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,123
WILLIAM: I should, shouldn't I?

1313
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:20,961
But I don't think I will.
You see, I don't want a fling.

1314
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:23,088
I want the real deal.

1315
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:26,425
APRIL: Forget about the real deal.
You don't find it, it finds you.

1316
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:29,636
What does that mean?
I don't know what that means.

1317
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,931
It means that you get to a certain age
and then you're ready.

1318
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:36,268
You know, you're ready for kids
or a commitment or, you know...

1319
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:37,769
-Sir.
-...a mortgage.

1320
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,855
-Table’s ready. Okay.
-Thanks.

1321
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:40,981
You know what I mean?

1322
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:44,192
And the person that you're with then,
they become the one.

1323
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:47,029
So you're saying it's not who, but it's when.

1324
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,822
-Exactly.
-Okay. All right.

1325
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:52,951
So there's never been a guy, ever,
that made you think, "This is it.

1326
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:54,953
"This is him. This is the one."

1327
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:56,663
No.

1328
01:12:57,457 --> 01:13:00,417
Okay, then why aren't you out there,
you know, enjoying yourself?

1329
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:01,752

Who's the lucky guy?

-Sam Knowles.
-Okay.

1501
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:22,265
But he's basically out of the picture.

1502
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:24,350
-He didn't make the cut, huh?
-Yeah.

1503
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:29,647
Well, I don't need a guy. I never really did.

1504
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:32,024
You were about the closest I ever got.

1505
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:36,195
No, really, when I was with you,
I thought, "This is it."

1506
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:37,572
But I screwed it up.

-I did. I so did.

You know, I'll see if I can make it.

1515

-I really want you to.
-I'll make it.

1516
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:04,182
I want to make amends
with anyone I ever hurt.

1517
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:07,769
And I figure it'll take about nine months,

1518
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,687
which is perfect timing.

Telling me this story,
this mystery love story.

1523
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:28,748
-What if I don't like who my mom is?
-Of course you'll like who your mom is.

1524
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:31,459
And you don't have to wait long to find out,
because that very night...

1525
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:34,420
It's Summer, isn't it?
And you're not my father.

1526
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:36,255
No wonder you didn't want to be with her.

And this one has a happy ending.

01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:46,265
How does it have a happy ending?

1530
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:50,728
You and my mom, whoever she is,
you're getting divorced.

1531
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:54,065
What's the happy in that?

Then how about a nice cup of tea?

1535
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:10,748
If you want, I'll still continue with the story.
Does that sound good?

01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:12,792
-Maya?
-Okay.

and drank and were such a slut.

he had just discovered that

I always imagined
that he'd make a more theatrical exit.

1563
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:43,109
What they didn't say was he was
on the couch with the dean's daughter.

-Jesus.
-I'm kidding.
