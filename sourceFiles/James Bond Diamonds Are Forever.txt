<i>("James Bond Theme")</i>

2
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,436
(Bond) Where is he?

3
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,727
I shan't ask you politely next time.

4
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,361
Where is Blofeld?

5
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,033
Cai... Cai...

6
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:08,910
Cairo!

7
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,832
Cards.

8
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,665
Hit me.

9
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,125
(Bond) One chance.

10
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,085
Where can I find him?

11
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,340
Marie...

12
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,259
<i>Ask Marie.</i>

13
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,299
Who are you?

14
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,687
My name is Bond. James Bond.

15
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,435
Is there something I can do for you?

16
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,443
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.

17
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,271
There is something I'd like you
to get off your chest.

18
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,947
(gasps)

19
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,280
(gagging)

20
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,861
Where is Ernst Stavro Blofeld?

21
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,116
(choking)

22
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,163
Speak up, darling. I can't hear you.

23
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,787
(man) We now come to
phase four: the nose.

24
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:03,420
In my opinion, the most difficult part
of a plastic transformation.

25
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,296
I want the operation done tonight.

26
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,423
But, senor...
- There's no time left.

27
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,676
But, Sefior Blofeld, this is
a most delicate procedure.

28
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,633
Tonight!

29
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,276
Keep the temperature
at precisely 80 degrees.

30
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:30,867
(door closes)

31
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,515
(Blofeld) Making mud pies, 007?

32
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,065
He would have been me
in a matter of days

33
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,647
if you'd given the poor fellow a chance.

34
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,530
Such a pity. I was dying to see
how the operation turned out.

35
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,157
Get his gun.

36
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,956
Hold it! Get your hands up.

37
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,004
Agh!

38
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,588
Kill him!

39
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,338
Welcome to hell, Blofeld.

40
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,635

00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,536
(WOMAN SINGING)
Diamonds are forever

00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,458
<i>They are all I need to please me</i>

43
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:29,333
<i>They can stimulate and tease me</i>

44
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,000
<i>They won't leave in the night</i>

45
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,836
<i>I've no fear that they might</i>

46
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,593
<i>Desert me</i>

47
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,136
<i>Diamonds are forever</i>

48
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,934
<i>Hold one up and then caress it</i>

49
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,275
<i>Touch it, stroke it and then dress it</i>

50
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,816
<i>I can see every pan'</i>

51
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,823
<i>Nothing hides in the heart</i>

52
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,496
<i>To hurt me</i>

53
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,960
<i>I don't need love</i>

54
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,173
<i>For what good will love do me?</i>

55
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:18,341
<i>Diamonds never lie to me</i>

56
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:24,472
<i>For when love's gone</i>

57
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,977
<i>They lustre on</i>

58
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,819
<i>Diamonds are forever</i>

59
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:40,279
<i>Sparkling round my little finger</i>

60
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,913
<i>Unlike men, the diamonds linger</i>

61
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,249
<i>Men are mere mortals who</i>

62
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,578
<i>Are not worth going to</i>

63
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,288
<i>Your grave for</i>

00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,216
<i>I don't need love</i>

65
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:04,182
<i>For what good will love do me?</i>

66
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,683
<i>Diamonds never lie to me</i>

67
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:15,194
<i>For when love's gone</i>

70
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:35,214
<i>Forever</i>

71
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:44,091
<i>And ever!</i>

72
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,137
Star of South Africa.

73
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,643
83.5 carats rough.

74
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,895
47.5 carats cut.

75
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,691
The Akbar Shah. 116 carats rough.

76
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,531
Are you paying attention, 007?

77
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,325
The Akbar Shah, 116 carats rough.

78
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,747
But surely, sir, there's no need
to bring in our section

79
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,701
on a relatively simple smuggling matter.

80
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,161
Sir Donald has convinced the PM
otherwise.

81
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,464
May I remind you, 007,
that Blofeld's dead.

82
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,791
Finished!

83
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:23,595
The least we can expect from you now
is a little plain, solid work.

84
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,964
Good morning, gentlemen.

85
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,846
- Sir Donald will see you now.
- Thank you.

86
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,015
Good morning, Sir Donald.

87
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:35,520
- This is Commander Bond.
- How do you do? Please sit down.

88
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,021
<i>-</i> Sherry?
- Not for me, thanks. Doctor's orders.

89
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,695
- Commander Bond?
- Yes, thank you.

90
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,740
You've been on holiday, I understand.

91
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,029
Relaxing, I hope.

92
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,204
Oh, hardly relaxing but most satisfying.

93
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,373
Cheers.

94
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,829
Pity about your liver, sir.
It's an unusually fine Solera.

95
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,125
- '51, I believe.
- There is no year for sherry, O07.

96
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,721
I was referring to the original vintage
on which the sherry is based, sir.

97
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,050
1851.

98
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,268
Unmistakable.

99
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,145
Precisely.

100
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,688
Tell me, Commander.

101
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:20,144
How far does your expertise extend
into the field of diamonds?

102
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,616
Hardest substance found in nature.
They cut glass. Suggest marriage.

103
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,739
They've replaced a dog
as a girl's best friend. That's about it.

104
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,288
Refreshing to hear there's one subject
you're not an expert on.

105
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:37,165
(Sir Donald) Perhaps I'd better give you
a brief background into our problem.

106
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:42,295
Eighty per cent of the world's diamonds
come from mines in South Africa.

107
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,343
<i>Most are dug out of shafts
of diamond-bearing clay</i>

108
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,762
<i>at depths of up to 3,000 feet.</i>

109
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,926
<i>The whole process, from start to finish,
is subject to an airtight security system.</i>

110
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,727
<i>It's an essential precaution,</i>

111
00:09:54,803 --> 00:10:00,310
<i>though the industry prides itself on
the loyalty and devotion of its workers.</i>

112
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:06,190
<i>Naturally the security measures
tend to ensure that loyalty,</i>

113
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,947
<i>as do the extensive amenities
and social services we provide</i>

114
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,704
<i>There's a permanent staff
of doctors, nurses,</i>

115
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,281
<i>even dentists.</i>

116
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:19,040
<i>The whole process, from start to finish,
is subject to an airtight security system.</i>

117
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,212
<i>It's a necessary precaution,</i>

118
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,337
<i>though the industry prides itself on
the loyalty and devotion of its workers.</i>

119
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,713
Next!

120
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,967
The scorpion.

121
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,811
Mother nature's finest killer, Mr Wint.

122
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,936
One is never too old
to learn from a master, Mr Kidd.

123
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,292
Dr Tynan? Good evening.

124
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,672
Who are you? And where is Joe?

125
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,970
Joe couldn't make it tonight.

126
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,843
I'm Mr Wint.

127
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,765
This is Mr Kidd.

128
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,763
Oh. I see.

129
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,744
(Kidd moans)

130
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,663
What's the matter with him?

131
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,742
It's my wisdom teeth.
I haven't had 'em out yet.

132
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,373
Would you mind having a look, Doctor?

133
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,795
Of course.

134
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,918
I'm not going to hurt you. Just open.

135
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,091
No, no. Open wide.

136
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,677
Agh!

137
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,723
Curious

138
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,776
how everyone who touches
those diamonds seems to die.

139
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:24,001
- Stop right there! Who are you?
- Dr Tynan sent us.

140
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,671
- Why didn't he come himself?
- He was taken sick.

141
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,669
Bitten by the bug.

142
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,842
He sent this for you.

143
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,764
If God had wanted man to fly...

144
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,477
He would have given him wings, Mr Kidd.

145
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,622
(Sir Donald)
No security system is perfect.

146
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,622
We've always accepted
a percentage of smuggling.

147
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:09,423
But over the past two years, despite all
our precautions, it's gone up alarmingly.

148
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,467
And none of the stones
have reached the market.

149
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,795
Sir Donald thinks someone's stockpiling.

150
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:20,054
Our concern is that someone might dump
them on the market to depress prices or...

151
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,727
Make you agree to perpetual blackmail.

152
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,475
Exactly.

153
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,683
What we need to know is

154
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,565
who the stockpilers are.

155
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,646
The letter U

156
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,277
is for umbrella.

157
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,117
We take it lest it rain.

158
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,320
We hope we shan't want it

159
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,201
till we're home again.

160
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,078
Two men to see you, missy.

161
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,542
(teacher) Gentlemen, Joshua.

162
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:50,667
I shan't be long, children.
Joshua is going to read you a story.

163
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,084
How nice to see you again!

164
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,421
- Where to this time?
- Amsterdam.

165
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,131
Amsterdam! Oh, how lovely!

166
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,514
I shall have to bring back some pictures
of the canals for the children.

167
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,472
Ask, and ye shall receive, Mrs Whistler.

168
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,527
Thus endeth the lesson
for today, gentlemen.

169
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,365
Several recent murders in South Africa
have complicated matters.

170
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,319
If they shut down operations
before we discover them...

171
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,950
It would be catastrophic for us

172
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,115
and for the government.

173
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,169
- I've always fancied a trip to South Africa.
- You're going to Holland.

174
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,091
For some time we've had our eyes
on a smuggler - Peter Franks.

175
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,463
He's due to leave for Amsterdam.

176
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,466
Do we know who his contacts are?

177
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,966
We do function
in your absence, Commander.

178
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,563
Passport, sir?

179
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,107
Ah, Mr Franks. There's a message
for you at Passport Control.

180
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,938
That door over there.
You can park outside.

181
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,153
Thank you.

182
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,791
(Ship's horn)

183
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,184
Mr Franks...

184
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,433
Your passport is quite in order.

185
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,519
Anyone seeing you
in that outfit, Moneypenny,

186
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,818
would certainly be discouraged
from leaving the country.

187
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,945
What can I bring you back from Holland?

188
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,943
A diamond?

189
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,444
In a ring?

190
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,029
Would you settle for a tulip?

191
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,283
Yes.

192
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,645
(female guide) Ahead is one of
the oldest bridges in Amsterdam.

193
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,476
The Skinny Bridge.

194
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,653
It was built over 300 years ago

195
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,857
by two sisters who wanted
to visit each other every day.

196
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:27,070
Unfortunately they ran out of money. So
that is why it is called the Skinny Bridge.

197
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,746
On your right,
those beautiful old houses

198
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,668
can be seen in the paintings
of our famous painter, Rembrandt.

199
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,540
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

200
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,296
if you will look to your left
as we go down the Amstel, you can see...

201
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,673
Oh!

202
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,731
Mrs Whistler did want some pictures
of the canals for the children.

203
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,354
How kind of you, Mr Kidd.

204
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,441
The children will be so thrilled.

205
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,922
<i>(woman) Yes?</i>

206
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,881
Franks. Peter Franks.

207
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,558
<i>Come up. Third ﬂoor.</i>

208
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,644
(buzzer)

209
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,480
<i>(easy-listening music)</i>

210
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,159
Make yourself at home!
I'll be out in a minute!

211
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,044
Help yourself to a drink!

212
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,631
Is, er, Mr Case not at home?

213
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:05,506
There is no Mr Case. The T is for Tiffany.

214
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,717
Tiffany Case?

215
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,840
Definitely distinctive.

216
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,346
I was born there, on the first floor,

217
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,100
while my mother was
looking for a wedding ring.

218
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,648
I'm glad for your sake
it wasn't Van Cleef and Arpels.

219
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,772
Weren't you a blonde when I came in?

220
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,483
Could be.

221
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:33,280
I tend to notice little things like that.
Whether a girl is a blonde or a brunette.

222
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,623
And which do you prefer?

223
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,251
Providing the collars and cuffs match...

224
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,538
We'll talk about that later.

225
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,840
Let me have your glass.

226
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,008
I'll get you some ice.

227
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:50,929
(door shuts)

228
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:18,617
That's quite a nice little nothing
you're almost wearing. I approve.

229
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,168
I don't dress for the hired help.

230
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,416
Let's see your passport, Franks.

231
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,381
Occupation: transport consultant?

232
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,095
That's a little cute, isn't it?

233
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,928
- I'll finish dressing.
- Oh, please don't. Not on my account.

234
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,558
I don't care much for redheads.
Terrible tempers.

235
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,479
But somehow it seems to suit you.

236
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,557
It's my own.

237
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,642
But it is in need of some soft lighting.

238
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:30,822
- I know a little restaurant...
- I never mix business with pleasure.

239
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,523
- Neither do I.
- Good!

240
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:37,783
Then save the cute remarks until after
you get the diamonds into Los Angeles.

241
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,415
- Well, where are they now?
- That's not your problem.

242
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,333
Your problem is getting them in.

243
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,208
- How much is there?
- 50,000 carats.

244
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:51,509
Well, at 142 carats an ounce, that's
an awful lot of ice. That won't be easy.

245
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,754
That's why you're being paid 50 grand.

246
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,932
What did you think it was going to be?
A pair of earrings?

247
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:02,228
And, Franks, for God's sakes,
come up with something original.

248
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,153
I've got to hand it to you, Q.
Quite ingenious.

249
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,528
Oh, an obvious little notion.
Thought it might come in handy.

250
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:19,909
Oh, M's been trying to get in touch with
you. That Peter Franks fellow's escaped.

251
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,915
<i>Killed one of the guards
on the way up to London</i>

252
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,121
Hello?

253
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,711
<i>Hello!</i>

254
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,039
Are you there?

255
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,248
Oh!

256
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,569
- (Tiffany) Yes?
- Peter Franks.

257
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,739
<i>Third ﬂoor.</i>

258
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,408
<i>- Guten Abend.
- Good evening.</i>

259
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,323
<i>Bitte.</i>

260
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,206
- You are English?
- Yes, I'm English.

261
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,580
I speak English.

262
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,588
- Who is your floor?
- Three, please.

263
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,267
<i>(lift starts)</i>

264
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,320
Is he dead?

265
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,193
I sincerely hope so.

266
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,781
- Who is he?
- No idea.

267
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,788
This chap's been following me
all day today.

268
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,624
My God!

269
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,295
You've just killed James Bond!

270
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,308
Is that who it was?

271
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,349
Well, it just proves
no one's indestructible.

272
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,275
You don't kill James Bond and
wait around for the cops to arrive!

273
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,898
We've got to get those diamonds
out of here fast!

274
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,650
Where are they?

275
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,618
A little old lady dropped them by
yesterday morning.

276
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,243
Priceless.

277
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,378
I think we ought to let Mr Bond
carry the load from here on out.

278
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,013
It's funny.

279
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:56,063
All the things one wanted to say
to one's brother when it's all too late.

280
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,891
Let me assure you
of our deepest condolences.

281
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,272
Would you please board the aircraft?

282
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:07,525
- We were inseparable, you know.
- Please, Mr Franks.

283
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:16,209
<i>(PA system) Lufthansa announce the
departure of ﬂight LH450 to Los Angeles.</i>

284
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:23,208
<i>Please fasten your seat belts,
and no smoking until airborne.</i>

285
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,963
<i>Thank you.</i>

286
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:30,674
They're both aboard. I must say,
Miss Case seems quite attractive.

287
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,634
For a lady.

288
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,476
(laughs nervously)

289
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:44,437
<i>Lufthansa announce the arrival
of flight LH450 from Amsterdam...</i>

290
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,568
- Mr Franks?
- Yes.

00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,695

292
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,197

293
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,876
Get some lunch, Jerry. I'll take over.

294

Death certificate, please, Mr Franks.

295
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,806
Well, well, well!
Felix Letter, you old fraud.

296
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,605
On behalf of the CIA,
welcome to America.

297
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,186
Someone sent their brain trust
down to meet you.

298
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,496
I give up. I know
the diamonds are in the body,

299
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,324
but where?

300
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,705
Alimentary, Dr Letter.

301
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,089
So long, James. Keep in touch.

302
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:51,587
(loudly) The rest of your luggage
has been cleared, Mr Franks. OK, fellas!

303
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,612
You, er, wanna sit
in the front, Mr Franks?

304
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,369
It's a lot smoother ride
in the front, Mr Franks.

305
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,284
Yes, I believe I'll sit in front.

306
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,434
The stiff - ahem! - deceased back there.

307
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,065
Your brother, Mr Franks?

308
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,817
Yes, it was.

309
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,990
I got a brudder.

310
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,403
Small world.

311
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,795
(Organ music)

312
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,145
Mr Franks, I'm Morton Slumber.

313
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,691
Please accept my heartfelt condolences
at this most difficult hour.

314
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,111
Well, he is heading
for a better world, Mr Slumber.

315
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,735
There is some consolation in that.

316
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:37,660
Now then, if we're ready
to begin the final journey...

317
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,378
(soulful choral singing)

318
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,650
- (singing stops)
- May his soul rest in peace.

319
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,072
Oh, yes. Amen.

320
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:19,573
If you'd come into my comfortable office,
we will bring you the urn.

321
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,747
I'm so happy you chose our half-couch,
hinged-panel, slumber-on casket.

322
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,245
I'm sure your brother
would have appreciated it.

323
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,419
I'm sure he did.

324
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,246
Please, be seated.

325
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,614
Ashes to ashes...

326
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,200
- Dust to dust.
- Exactly.

327
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:04,530
At a moment like this, I'm sure
you'd rather be left alone, for reflection.

328
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,785
Most thoughtful.

329
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,459
We've selected a private niche for your
brother in our Garden of Remembrance.

330
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:14,335
The one with the restful chartreuse
curtains and Angel's Breath gold trim.

331
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,337
I hope you'll find everything in order.

332
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,135
The arrangements
have been impeccable

333
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,638
so far.

334
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,629
Very moving.

335
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,464
Heart-warming, Mr Wint.

336
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,424
A glowing tribute, Mr Kidd.

337
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,555
(soulful choral singing)

338
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,560
<i>(singing stops)</i>

339
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:41,483
You dirty, double-crossin' limey fink!
Those goddamn diamonds are phonies!

340
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,780
No, don't tell me. You're St Peter?

341
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,237
Paste! Glass!
Where's the real stuff, Franks?

342
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,826
Where's the real money? You wouldn't
burn 50,000 real dollars, would you?

343
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,669
One last break.
Where are the real diamonds?

344
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,713
You get me the real money

345
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,166
and I'll bring you the real diamonds.

346
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,217
Where do you think you're goin'?

347
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,421
I hear that the Hotel Tropicana
is quite comfortable.

348
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,598
My condolences, gentlemen.

349
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,554
Hello, Felix.

350
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,387
Very comfortable.
But there's one problem.

351
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,768
I want the real merchandise -
rather quickly.

352
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,442
Q <i>has just arrived with it.
We'll be up with them in the morning</i>

353
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:25,364
<i>So I 'd sit tight if I were you.
There's no sense in looking for trouble.</i>

354
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,658
<i>Just enjoy yourself I James.
I'm sure you know how.</i>

355
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:32,826
Quite. I'll probably take in a show.

356
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,248
(show tune)

357
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,318
(laughter and applause)

358
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,951
(Shady Tree) How do you like me so far?

359
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,955
People say I have
the body of Rock Hudson.

360
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:22,955
If he ever finds out what I'm doin' to it,
he'll be madder than hell.

361
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,881
I call these girls my Acorns.

362
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:29,671
Actually, they're a gift from Willard Whyte,
who is upstairs right now

363
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:33,223
- playing Monopoly with real buildings.
- (laughter)

364
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:38,805
Tryin' to find Willard Whyte is like
tryin' to find a virgin in a maternity ward.

365
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:42,771
On behalf of the Whyte House,
I wanna let you folks know

366
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,601
you've been a lousy audience.

367
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,732
So get lost. See ya later.

368
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,796
(Wint) Shady Tree!

369
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,846
- Shady, we just adored your act!
- What taste, style!

370
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,426
And we have a few suggestions.

371
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:21,605
Critics and material I don't need!
I haven't changed my act in 40 years.

372
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,400
Hold it! Don't go in there.

373
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:35,197
We didn't get the real diamonds,
so we need Tree - alive.

374
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,324
That's most annoying.

375
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:59,093
<i>-</i> (man) Get down there!
- Crap. Boxcar, the loser.

376
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,304
Well, that's it, pussycat.
I shot the whole wad.

377
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,731
What do you say? Back to my place?

378
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:08,151
You're a nice person, Maxie.
Really, you are.

379
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,400
Why don't you go and take a nap?
And I'll see you next year.

380
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,154
(Bond) May I have $5,000?
No, make it $10,000.

381
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,860
$2,000 limit.

382
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,908
Is there some problem?

383
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,868
Mr Saxby.

384
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,501
Gentleman wants $10,000 credit
with a $2,000 limit.

385
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,757
My name is Franks.

386
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,842
Peter Franks.

387
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,505
Mr Franks' credit's good.

388
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,717
- Good luck to you, Mr Franks.
- Thank you. I'll have two stacks now.

389
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,270
Give the gentleman 4,000.

390
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,685
Thank you.

391
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,937
Hi! I'm Plenty.

392
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,565
- But of course you are.
- Plenty O'Toole.

393
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,568
Named after your father, perhaps?

394
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:57,071
Would you like some help?
On the craps, I mean.

395
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,777
That's very kind of you.

396
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,280
Coming out. Coming out.

397
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,663
Next shooter is a lady.
Ladies are lucky. For the lady.

398
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,166
Nine. Mark nine.

399
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,882
Seven, loser. The lucky lady craps out.

400
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,553
New shooter. Your shot, Mr F.

401
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:32,690
<i>- Willard Whyte speakin'.
- Tree is dead. Turn on number two.</i>

402
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,566
<i>It's Peter Franks.</i>

403
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,905
Hard ten. Ten's the number.

404
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:46,867
I'll take the full odds on the ten.
200 on the hard way.

405
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:51,080
The limit on all the numbers,
250 on the eleven. Thank you very much.

406
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,507
Say! You've played this game before!

407
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,676
Just once.

408
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,839
- Now what do we do?
- Don't bother me with details, Bert!

409
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,924
Just get me the diamonds!

410
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:12,059
You handle those cubes
like a monkey handles coconuts.

411
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:16,066
Thank you, gentlemen,
for such a sterling service.

412
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,398
Well, that's 50,000 dollars!

413
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,486
Minus $5,000 for you, leaves me
$45,000, and thank you very much.

414
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,617
Well, it was nothing, really!

415
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:29,409
You know something, Peter Franks?
You're a terrific guy!

416
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,120
A little weird, but a terrific guy!

417
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,706
Say, why don't we go someplace
and have a drink?

418
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,790
A drink?

419
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,213
If you'd like to come in, Plenty.

420
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:45,096
Oh, how pretty!
What a super place you have!

421
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,051
Mm.

422
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,158
Just give me one second, lover.

423
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,671
Good evening.

424
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,216
I'm afraid you've caught me
with more than my hands up.

425
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:30,475
Hey, what the hell is this?
A perverts' convention or something?

426
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,852
Hey, you can't do this to me!

427
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,901
Stop that! I've got friends in this tovwvwn!

428
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,286
Exceptionally fine shot.

429
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,573
I didn't know there was
a pool down there.

430
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:57,084
Let's get down to business.
I presume you've come for the real...

431
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,629
The real diamonds.

432
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,107
Good evening, Miss Case.

433
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,740
Sorry about your fulsome friend.

434
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,949
I'll bet you really missed something.

435
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,535
Well, the evening may not be
a total loss after all.

436
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,837
Why don't we talk a bit first?

437
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,880
First?

438
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,926
Well, what would you like to talk about?

439
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,341
You pick a subject.

440
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,924
- Diamonds?
- Good boy!

441
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:54,263
And you want to know where they are,
and whether I'm working alone or not.

442
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,848
So far, so good. Keep going.

443
00:41:57,432 --> 00:42:00,686
- And if not, then with whom.
- (rustle of clothing)

444
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,317
So you can inform your superiors and

445
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,567
acquire the diamonds.

446
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,866
Peter!

447
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,070
I'm very impressed.

448
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:13,407
There's a lot more to you
than I had expected.

449
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,751
Presumably I'm the condemned man,

450
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,625
and obviously
you're the hearty breakfast.

451
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,047
Right?

452
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,716
You're not going to tell me
where the diamonds are, are you?

453
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,969
What diamonds?

454
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,558
Sooner or later you'll have to talk.

455
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,556
They'll make you.

456
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:38,105
At the very least, you'll never
get out of town alive.

457
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,352
I can solve that little problem.

458
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:47,991
It's lucky for me that I ran into you.

459
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,153
Fifty-fifty split.

460
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,331
You get the diamonds, I get us out.

461
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,120
Us?

462
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,500
Well, I can't very well help you
and then stick around.

463
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,458
We could be on a plane and
out of the country by tomorrow night.

464
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,544
Rio. Hong Kong.

465
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,595
I know a good tailor in Hong Kong.

466
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,764
Hong Kong.

467
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:16,262
All right. I'll get the diamonds,
you get the plane tickets.

468
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,312
No. The airport's too obvious.

469
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:21,106
A rented car should
do us fine for openers.

470
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,605
That's good thinking.

471
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:28,906
And since you're the one being watched,
I'll get the diamonds, you get the car.

472
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,242
That's very good thinking.

473
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,285
Oh, Peter...!

474
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:38,117
I have a feeling this is the beginning
of a wonderful relationship.

475
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,468
- Darling...
- Mm?

476
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:51,217
Where do I pick up the diamonds?

477
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:56,389
Well... When was the last time
you visited a circus?

478
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,021
Circus Circus proudly presents

479
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,599
the Flying Palacios!

480
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,776
(waltZ)

481
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:30,673
- She's in the building.
- Right. Stand by.

482
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:34,631
James, next time, pick a contact point
when you're standing up.

483
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:39,015
- Felix, if she gives your men the slip...
- Relax. I have 30 agents down there.

484
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,642
A mouse with sneakers on
couldn't get through.

485
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,047
Give Maxwell his cue.

486
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,632
This is Quarterback.

487
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:12,260
<i>Operation Passover, commence.</i>

488
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,212
<i>Quarterback to Tight End.</i>

489
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,172
<i>Operation Passover, commence.</i>

490
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,849
Roger.

491
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,421
Well, she's on her way. So far, so good.

492
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,344
- Good luck, Felix. I'll see you later.
- Where are you going'?

493
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,592
The car rental agency.

494
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,550
Our little rendezvous?

495
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:04,263
You don't actually think she'll show up?
That's a thousand-to-one shot.

496
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:05,813
No, more like even money.

497
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:09,984
Her devotion to larceny
versus my incomparable charm.

498
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,362
(barker) All right, kiddies!
Ready? Aim! Fire!

499
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,826
What did I tell you?
Didn't I promise you a winner every time?

500
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,785
There you are, young man.

501
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:33,045
Boys and girls, here we go again.
All you have to do is just take your gun...

502
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:37,630
Here we have a little lady,
here we have a little man,

503
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,806
and here we have a big lady.

504
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,303
You're a little out of your league,
aren't ya, sister?

505
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:44,636
Point the gun. You know what to do.

506
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:46,892
All ready? Get set.

507
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,269
Now hold it till I say go.

508
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,440
Go!

509
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,731
Come on! That's it!

510
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,405
Everybody point right at the clown.
A winner every time!

511
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:01,410
There we are! All right!
That's the way to do it!

512
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,783
Oh, look at that!
And we have another winner!

513
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:11,538
Annie Oakley on the end, huh?

514
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,373
Here we are. What an eye! What an eye!

515
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:17,176
(boy) Wait a second!
I saw the whole thing!

516
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,845
The machine's fixed!
Who's she - your mother?

517
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,257
Blow up your pants!

518
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,185
(boy) One win! She only had one win!

519
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,763
You're supposed to have 24
to win that dog!

520
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,519
Will you give it a rest, kid?

521
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:33,226
All right, boys and girls! Here we go!

522
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,361
(drum roll)

523
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,949
(trumpet fanfare)

524
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,373
(trumpeli"9)

525
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:09,058
<i>(barker) Here for the first time, see
Zambora, strangest girl ever born to live.</i>

526
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,980
<i>She was captured
near Nairobi, South Africa,</i>

527
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:15,435
<i>and is believed to be part
of a cruel, inhuman experiment.</i>

528
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:19,989
<i>This beautiful girl
will be locked into a steel cage,</i>

529
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:25,283
<i>will change very slowly
into a ferocious 450-pound gorilla.</i>

530
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,406
(Yiddish accent) Please be
very still, ladies and gentlemen.

531
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,457
We must have absolute silence

532
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:34,709
so we wouldn't disturb Zambora
from her transcendental state.

533
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:39,626
We must warn you that
in every scientific experiment

534
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,836
there's always a danger.

535
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,593
So keep in mind those curtains is an exit.

536
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:48,848
God forbid something should go wrong
over here, get outta here!

537
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,811
Now we start the transformation.

538
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,518
Very dangerous. Very quiet, please.

539
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,566
(electronic trilling)

540
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,495
(synthesised noises)

541
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,556
(man) Wake, my beauty, wake!

542
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,599
(growling)

543
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,729
(growling becomes ferocious)

544
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,932
(screams)

545
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,481
Hey, lady, not through there.
The other way.

546
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,865
Come on!

547
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:06,387
(car horn)

548
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:14,888
- No show?
- Felix, don't tell me you lost her?

549
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,267
We lost her.

550
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,533
Nice place you have here.

551
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:29,736
Take something off. Enjoy the sun.

552
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,321
You've got a lot of guts showing up here!

553
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:36,371
Letting me freeze my behind off
at a blackjack table for two hours

554
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,418
waiting for some nonexistent diamonds!

555
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:41,756
And what the hell
is my black wig doing in the pool?

556
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,936
- She's...
- Dead.

557
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:03,311
Supposed to be you.
The next link in the pipeline.

558
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,947
What are you talking about?

559
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,572
Poor Plenty must have
stumbled in here looking for you.

560
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,904
I don't believe you.

561
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:17,242
A dentist is dead in South Africa.
That little old lady in Amsterdam.

562
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,373
Shady got his last night.
They've missed me once.

563
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,829
And you're next.

564
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:24,874
- Now, who's your connection?
- You sound like a cop...

565
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:31,180
- Who's your connection?
- All I know is voices on a phone.

566
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:35,055
They got me this place and told me
to wait for further instructions.

567
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,102
You'd find it difficult to hear under water.

568
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,397
- Now, where's the stuff?
- Who are you?

569
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,645
You're not a cop
and you're not Peter Franks.

570
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,561
You're not the type to turn
the other cheek. Where is it?

571
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:50,775
<i>(Tannoy) Eastern Airlines announce the
arrival of flight 112 from Los Angeles,</i>

572
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,701
<i>gate 7.</i>

573
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,105
Thank you.

574
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,384
Fill it up, please.

575
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,935
It's Bert Saxby.

576
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,472
(Tiffany) Willard Whyte's right-hand man.

577
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,321
Do you see the top? The penthouse?

578
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:14,404
They say Willard Whyte hasn't
set foot out of there in three years.

579
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:16,577
And no one has seen him - no one.

580
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,871
- How much is that?
- Did you pay for this?

581
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,453
Cut him off.

582
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,802
Hey, Curly! What about my stamps?

583
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,218
Where are you going?
Are you mad? Let me by!

584
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:42,269
Stamps? You ain't got no gas yet!

585
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:46,558
- OK, so shove a coupla gallons in!
- Well, back it up.

586
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,643
(hoots horn)

587
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:53,943
Keep leaning on that tooter, Charlie,
and you'll get a shot in the mouth!

588
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,736
Come on, lady, move it!

589
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,910
OK, lady, you win, you win.

590
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:00,204
(horns hooting)

591
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:03,408
- Will someone move that car?
- Do what he says!

592
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,504
Hey! I wanted high-test!

593
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:12,841
Forget it, Curly!
You had your chance and you blew it!

594
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,950
OK, Professor.

595
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,903
- Hello.
- Hi.

596
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:49,240
- I haven't seen you here before.
- I'm Klaus Hergersheimer.

597
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:52,497
- New here?
- I've been here three years. G Section.

598
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,749
How are things in G Section?

599
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,915
Still the same old grind. You know.

600
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:00,342
Checking radiation shields
for replacement.

601
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,840
By the way, where's yours?

602
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:07,266
Er... I've been waiting a couple of days
for you guys to deliver them.

603
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:10,265
Gee, I'm sorry. You should have
given us a phone call.

604
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:15,225
Look, I've got one here.
Lucky for you, I carry spares.

605
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:18,481
You keep that on. You can't be
too careful about radiation.

606
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,938
Absolutely. I feel much safer with this on.

607
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,989
See you around.

608
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:32,325
(random bleeps)

609
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,976
Who are you? What do you want?

610
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,894
Klaus Hergersheimer. G Section.

611
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,814
Just, er, checking on radiation shields.

612
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,983
Now let me see. You are...

613
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:00,811
Professor Dr Metz. Our shields are fine!

614
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,316
Now get out!

615
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:05,445
I'm sorry. It won't take a moment but

616
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,322
I must verify.

617
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:10,029
Metz. How do you spell it?

618
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:13,867
M-E... Will you please leave,
you irritating man?

619
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:17,623
Doctor, there's no reason
to run down the little people.

620
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,256
G Section may not be as important
to the operation as you are,

621
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,674
but we do have our orders.

622
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,592
Dr Metz. Willard Whyte for you.

623
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,762
Right. Out, out.

624
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:32,972
(Metz) Hello, ww.

625
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,687
Yes, it's finally here.

626
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,932
Oh, quite enough for completion.

627
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:43,316
We'll be through shortly.

628
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,443
No. No problems at all.

629
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,612
Right.

630
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:56,079
- Now will you get out of here?
- Certainly, Doctor.

631
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:58,456
I've seen everything I need to see.

632
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:00,958
Thank you very much.

633
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:07,507
Hi. Sorry to bother you.
I'm Klaus Hergersheimer.

634
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,967
G Section.

635
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,510
Checking radiation shields?

636
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,654
(Siren)

637
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,112
There he is! Behind the rock! Come on!

638
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,246
<i>(man) What is this? Amateur night?</i>

639
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,248
<i>Stop him, Harry!</i>

640
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,455
(alarm)

641
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,759
<i>Get him off that machine. That isn't a toy.</i>

642
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,256
<i>Get out of that moon buggy!</i>

643
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:16,613
(alarm still sounding)

644
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:19,699
It's gone berserk!

645
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:24,167
Hey, what do you think you're doin'?

646
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:07,141
That way!

647
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,793
- What happened? The diamonds...
- Get in the car!

648
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:12,372
If you see a mad professor
in a minibus, just smile!

649
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:33,311
- Fred, get the sheriff's office.
- OK.

650
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:46,532
Listen, drop me off at the next corner.
This is getting out of hand.

651
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:49,993
When you start stealing moon machines
from Willard Whyte,

652
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,623
goodbye and good luck!

653
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:55,173
Just relax. I have a friend named Felix
who can fix anything.

654
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,250
Is he married?

655
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:03,511
There goes that
son-of-a-bitchin' saboteur!

656
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,684
(Siren)

657
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:18,363
Relax! You've got a friend
named Felix who can fix anything.

658
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:20,486
Unfortunately, so can Willard Whyte.

659
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,323
Why, you dirty...

660
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:34,121
(Siren)

661
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,989
(car horn)

662
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:51,425
Come in, Larry. Larry?

663
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:54,014
<i>Larry?</i>

664
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:56,141
<i>Did you get him, Larry?</i>

665
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,020
I think Larry got him.

666
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,851
- Sheriff...
- Attaboy, Larry.

667
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:03,778
Come in. Larry?

668
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,275
Sheriff...

669
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,781
(Siren)

670
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,630
I got you now.

671
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,461
Lean over.

672
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:03,171
(Tiffany) Darling...

673
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:07,217
Why are we suddenly staying
in the bridal suite of the Whyte House?

674
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:10,546
In order to form
a more perfect union, sweetheart.

675
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,135
James...

676
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,933
May I finally call you James?

677
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:21,352
What's going to happen to me?

678
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:26,652
You did talk to
your friend Felix about me?

679
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:27,820
Mm-hm.

680
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,943
Well, what did he say?

681
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:33,618
Something about 20 years to life.
Nothing important.

682
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:36,947
- 20 years to life?
- Relax, darling.

683
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:38,873
I'm on top of the situation.

684
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,343
Mr and Mrs Jones?

685
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:54,468
Yes, that's the name
on the register, Mr Letter.

686
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,141
- What's the score with WW?
- Washington says no go.

687
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:59,059
- We sit still for now.
- Sit still?

688
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:04,187
And Miss Tiffany Case "Jones" has
a lifetime reservation at another hotel.

689
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:06,688
The kind the government runs.

690
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:09,108
I'm cooperating, Mr Letter.

691
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,071
Really I am.

692
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,575
I can vouch for that.

693
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,405
Felix, this is not the real White House,
and he's not the president.

694
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:20,741
- Why don't we go and see him?
- The president I can get you in to see.

695
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:24,453
But until Washington believes
Whyte's a thief, that's the way it is.

696
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:27,379
In the meantime, I'm sure
you and "Mrs Jones"

697
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:29,332
can find some way to amuse yourselves.

698
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:33,511
And just to make sure you're not
disturbed, I have a man upstairs.

699
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:36,931
And Hamilton is right out here.

700
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:39,221
So long, James.

701
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,849
- Well, that's a switch!
- What's that?

702
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:45,023
The wolf being guarded
by the three little pigs.

703
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:46,850
(Bond chuckles)

704
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:49,356
I won't be long, darling.

705
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,654
Where are you going?

706
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:54,615
I'm just popping upstairs for a moment.

707
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:07,086
<i>-</i> Sixteenth floor?
- (lift man) No, lady. Starlight Lounge only.

708
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:11,424
OK, folks. Stand clear
of the doors. Here we go.

709
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:50,247
(Clunk)

710
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:54,835
(lift man) Starlight Lounge to the left.
Express to street level only, folks.

711
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:58,842
OK. Stand clear of the doors. Here we go.

712
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:33,793
<i>(man over speaker) Howdy, son.
We've been expectin' you.</i>

713
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:36,417
<i>You got any personal business
to take care of in there,</i>

714
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:37,963
<i>you go right ahead.</i>

715
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:40,167
<i>First, I suspect you're wearfn'</i> a <i>hog leg</i>

716
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:43,503
<i>Would you mind standin' up
and takin' it off?</i>

717
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,388
<i>Aw. Isn't that nice?</i>

718
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:51,561
<i>You are a pleasant fella.</i>

719
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:54,764
<i>Why don't you just come on in, son?</i>

720
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,396
<i>Relax. Make yourself comfortable.</i>

721
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:59,978
<i>That's good. Right on over there.</i>

722
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:22,795
Good evening, Mr Bond.

723
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,343
Blofeld.

724
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,965
Good evening, O07.

725
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,057
Double jeopardy, Mr Bond.

726
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:36,976
You killed my only other double,
I'm afraid.

727
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:41,983
After his death, volunteers were
- understandably - rather scarce.

728
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:45,656
Such a pity. All that time and expense

729
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:48,860
simply to provide you
with one mock-heroic moment.

730
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,078
(phone rings)

731
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:57,626
Willard Whyte speakin'.

732
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:01,255
Yes, Governor. I got your message.

733
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:04,963
No, I'm afraid a personal appearance
is quite out of the question.

734
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:08,379
I'll send a deposition to the committee.

735
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:10,590
Thank you, Governor.

736
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,139
Well, that's a neat trick.

737
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,641
A voice box, Mr Bond.

738
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:18,473
Science was never my strong suit,

739
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:20,854
but the principle is easy enough.

740
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,686
Someone's voice patterns
and resonance

741
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:27,023
stored in a small oral-signature tape.

742
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:30,952
And a miniature, transistorized version
is installed in his neck.

743
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,279
Or is it his neck? I never can remember.

744
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:36,203
Anyway, no matter. We both sound alike.

745
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:40,954
My congratulations to you both.

746
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:46,801
Well. Nice little company.

747
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:52,223
Explosives, oil, electronics,
houses, aviation.

748
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,141
I've done rather well with it, too.

749
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:58,642
Tried to cut some of the fat off,
but Mr Whyte's a splendid administrator.

750
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:01,315
Damn thing runs itself.

751
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,937
I suppose you killed him.

752
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:04,644
Nothing so melodramatic.

753
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:07,571
I'm simply holding him
in cold storage, so to speak.

754
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:12,117
An insurance policy against any
outside interference with my plans.

755
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:15,697
The ideal kidnap victim.
No one's seen the man for five years.

756
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,249
Who'd miss someone
who's already missing?

757
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,497
How clever you are, Mr Bond.

758
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:25,252
Nice to see you haven't lost
that fine mental edge, 007.

759
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,880
Please don't get any foolish notions.

760
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:30,461
That missile is not a practical weapon.

761
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:35,600
- Well, it's hardly worth the effort.
- (cat meows)

762
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:38,894
After all, I wouldn't know
which one of you to kill.

763
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:41,643
We appreciate
your predicament, Mr Bond.

764
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:43,724
We deeply sympathise.

765
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,374
Right idea, Mr Bond.

766
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,498
But wrong pussy.

767
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:11,336
I do so enjoy our little visits, Mr Bond,

768
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:15,339
however potentially painful they may be.

769
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:17,675
But I'm afraid this one
has come to an end.

770
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:19,681
What do you intend to do
with those diamonds?

771
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,896
An excellent question.

772
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:26,521
And one which will be hanging
on the lips of the world quite soon.

773
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:28,815
If I were to break the news to anyone,

774
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:31,488
it would be to you first. You know that.

775
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:34,317
But it's late, I'm tired,

776
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,448
and there's so much left to do.

777
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:41,411
Good night, Mr Bond.

778
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:51,842
Well, go on, go on. It's merely a lift.

779
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,887
Or perhaps I should say "elevator".

780
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,683
In any event, I'm sure
you'll find it much more convenient

781
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:02,762
than mountaineering about
outside the Whyte House.

782
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:05,764
You press L, Mr Bond.

783
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:08,230
The word "lobby" begins with L.

784
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:28,545
(Bond collapses)

785
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:43,595
If at first you don't succeed, Mr Kidd...

786
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:45,896
Try, try again, Mr Wint.

787
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:29,245
(both snigger)

788
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,378
One of us smells like
a tart's handkerchief.

789
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:06,839
I'm afraid it's me.
Sorry about that, old boy.

790
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:09,683
(squeak)

791
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:51,095
(man) I don't mind the cockamamie
machine breaking down twice a day.

792
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:55,931
But why the hell does it always have to be
500 yards away from the nearest hatch?

793
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:01,769
All right, Charlie.
It's your turn to play hunchback.

794
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,361
Thank you very much.

795
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:11,162
I was just out walking my rat
and I seem to have lost my way.

796
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:17,660
Willard Whyte speakin'.

797
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,871
This is Bert.

798
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,457
We got a problem.

799
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:28,095
<i>What's wrong with your voice?
Got a cold?</i>

800
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:33,509
Never mind about that.

801
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:35,640
I just saw James Bond in the casino.

802
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:38,689
<i>- That's impossible.
- Come and see for yourself.</i>

803
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:40,266
Hey, listen.

804
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:44,024
If he's half the genius they say he is,
we're in for real trouble.

805
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:47,732
- Calm <i>down,</i> Bert.
- It's a cinch he's not working alone.

806
01:23:47,814 --> 01:23:50,533
This place must be
crawling with agents by now.

807
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:53,237
- I think we should move Willard Whyte.
- Nonsense.

808
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:56,290
<i>Mr Whyte is perfectly safe
at his own summerhouse.</i>

809
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:58,993
It's on the ridge,
about ten miles out of town.

810
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:02,462
<i>I'm a little surprised, Ben'.
It's not like you to panic.</i>

811
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:06,375
I just don't enjoy messing around
with a guy as tough as James Bond.

812
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:10,634
Never mind James Bond.
You get down to that house.

813
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:13,761
I'm afraid Mr Whyte has suddenly
outgrown his usefulness.

814
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,059
- Do it cleanly, Bert.
- Don't worry.

815
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:18,262
Just leave everything to me.

816
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:23,688
That ridiculous contraption
actually seems to work, Q.

817
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,236
You've surpassed yourself this time.

818
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:30,066
Not a bit of it. Made one of these
for the kids last Christmas.

819
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:32,242
Maxwell, James and I
will head for the house.

820
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:35,366
Get set to hit the penthouse
<i>as</i> soon as we find Whyte.

821
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:37,748
(Blofeld) Let me speak to Metz.

822
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:41,578
There's been a change.
Push all plans forward by 24 hours.

823
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,662
I'm joining you immediately.

824
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:54,761
Give me five minutes to get up there
and five minutes to find Whyte.

825
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:57,802
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

826
01:24:58,885 --> 01:25:01,058
Ask me again in ten minutes' time.

827
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:06,355
Tell Maxwell to stand by
to hit the penthouse.

828
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,284
Well, hi there!

829
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:07,921
I'm Bambi.

830
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,583
Good morning Bambi.

831
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:14,010
And I'm Thumper.

832
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:16,589
Is there something we can do for you?

833
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:20,676
I can think of several things offhand but

834
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:23,057
at the moment
I'm looking for Willard Whyte.

835
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:24,388
Oh, Willie.

836
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:26,599
Why, he's, er, right out there.

837
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:32,737
And, er, that's all there is to it?

838
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:35,024
Not quite.

839
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:39,494
First, we're gonna have a ball.

840
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:43,866
(grunts)

841
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,623
All yours, Bambi!

842
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:05,311
You're on again, Bambi!

843
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:12,311
Thumper...

844
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:55,316
Yah!

845
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:39,990
Hello, Felix.

846
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:43,660
Willard Whyte is about to be executed,

847
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,658
and guess who's giving
breaststroke lessons.

848
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:51,035
- Where the hell is Whyte?
- I haven't found out yet.

849
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,673
Still haven't found out.

850
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:06,758
Right!

851
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:25,369
(toilet ﬂushes)

852
01:29:31,908 --> 01:29:33,501
FBI?

853
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,712
- CIA?
- No.

854
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:38,290
British Intelligence, Mr Whyte.
James Bond.

855
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:44,172
I see you've met my friends,
Bambi and Thumper.

856
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:46,302
Yes, we did have a bit of a chat.

857
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:50,557
What the hell's happened to me
and what can I do about it?

858
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:54,640
Let's get out of here first
and I'll explain it to you en route.

859
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:58,185
- Tell Maxwell to hit the penthouse...
- (gunshot)

860
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:00,984
(machine-gun fire)

861
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:07,994
Aaargh!

862
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:13,955
Saxby.

863
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:18,293
- Bert Saxby?
- Yeah.

864
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:20,499
Tell him he's fired.

865
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:38,483
Hi there, Mr Q. Are you having any luck?

866
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:41,277
I'm being somewhat successful,
thank you.

867
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:43,606
Listen, Mr Q. I... I was wondering.

868
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,941
Have you heard any talk about me

869
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:48,652
from Felix or James?

870
01:30:48,735 --> 01:30:50,578
No, I'm afraid not.

871
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:53,248
I guess I'm working
for the good guys now,

872
01:30:53,323 --> 01:30:56,327
but I'm two steps away from
the slammer if they want me there.

873
01:30:56,409 --> 01:31:00,789
I thought you might be able
to put in a good word.

874
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:11,095
That's unbelievable!

875
01:31:12,717 --> 01:31:16,472
An electromagnetic RPM controller.

876
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:19,353
Been aching to give it a try. You see,

877
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:22,811
pressure on the case when
the desired symbols appear

878
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:28,822
causes the rotation of the cylinders to
stutter at the precise moment needed to...

879
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,902
(coins pour out)

880
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:40,375
Cab, lady?

881
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:51,844
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

882
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:54,176
I'm delighted to meet you, Miss Case.

883
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:58,230
I'd so dreaded the prospect of
making this tedious journey alone.

884
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:04,436
This way, Mr Whyte.

885
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:13,028
(Bond) It was right here.

886
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:15,955
About six feet high, with a solar panel.

887
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:19,911
- It had these aerofoils that seemed to...
- Draw it for me.

888
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:22,792
Was Dr Metz on your payroll, Mr Whyte?

889
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:25,920
No. But I heard of him.
Everybody in our business has.

890
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:29,094
The world's leading expert
on laser refraction.

891
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:31,843
A committed idealist to peace.

892
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:36,142
And how in the hell Blofeld got
his hooks in him, I will never know!

893
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:39,555
How did he get security clearance
to work here in the first place?

894
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:43,107
From you, sir. I talked
to you personally about it.

895
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:45,527
I even recognized your voice just now.

896
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:47,696
I'm sure I must've told you

897
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:51,901
not to keep the usual duplicate
microfilm records of the project.

898
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:53,906
Exactly, sir.

899
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:57,580
Tom, what did I tell you to do with this?

900
01:32:57,655 --> 01:33:00,124
Send it to Vandenberg, sir.

901
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,874
Well, get 'em on the phone - now!

902
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:09,130
(phone rings)

903
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:10,756
Yeah?

904
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:12,633
You won't believe this.

905
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:14,806
- Willard Whyte for you!
- Wow.

906
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:17,805
- This is a real honour, sir.
- Shove your honour!

907
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:22,060
- Where's that satellite I sent down there?
- Blasted off 24 minutes ago, sir.

908
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:30,902
Perfect trajectory. All systems go.
We expect to enter orbit right on the nose.

909
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:39,956
- Wait. Something's happened.
- Just a moment.

910
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:42,955
- (electronic buzz)
- The scanners have gone crazy.

911
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:46,584
- Premature first-stage separation!
- It doesn't make sense!

912
01:33:58,842 --> 01:33:59,889
Stand by to abort!

913
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:05,815
We can't control it, sir.

914
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:07,062
Abort it!

915
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:09,481
It's negative.

916
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:11,859
We can't. Something's taken over
the guidance system!

917
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:15,367
It's as if it had a will of its own.

918
01:34:15,441 --> 01:34:18,035
And there's not a damn thing
we can do about it.

919
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:20,864
We're working on it.
I'll call you back, Mr Whyte.

920
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:28,129
Well, whatever it is,
your friend Blofeld's controllin' it now.

921
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:39,258
A vast supply of diamonds manipulated
by an expert in light refraction.

922
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,684
The first laser beam
was generated through a diamond.

923
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:44,763
And if old Metz deserves his reputation,

924
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:47,975
the power of that thing
could be incredible.

925
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:49,900
And Blofeld's got it.

926
01:34:53,563 --> 01:34:56,567
<i>- Where is it now?
- (man) Approaching North Dakota.</i>

927
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:58,743
Alert Strategic Air Command.

928
01:34:58,818 --> 01:35:00,616
Gimme an open line to SAC.

929
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:06,285
<i>(PA system) Attention all personnel.
Attention all personnel.</i>

930
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:10,372
<i>We have a red alert. Stand by
for emergency procedure.</i>

931
01:35:26,346 --> 01:35:28,474
(phone rings)

932
01:35:29,599 --> 01:35:31,647
Willard Whyte.

933
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:37,816
Yes, General.

934
01:35:40,818 --> 01:35:45,665
One of our missiles just "accidentally"
blew up in North Dakota.

935
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:49,835
Whatever's happenin',
Mr Bond, has started.

936
01:36:10,515 --> 01:36:14,520
- (Whyte) Is this your herd?
- Mr Whyte, phone call from Washington.

937
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:16,775
- Urgent.
- I'll catch it in the john.

938
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:18,948
- What about Blofeld?
- Not a trace.

939
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:20,570
We found a tunnel. We'll check it out.

940
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:23,620
- Where's Tiffany?
- Do you mind if we find Blofeld first?

941
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,789
Come on! Let's hit that tunnel!

942
01:36:43,923 --> 01:36:46,051
Aaaarrghhhh!

943
01:36:46,926 --> 01:36:49,054
(explosion)

944
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:57,821
Well, Washington just got word
from your friend with the cat.

945
01:36:57,895 --> 01:37:01,945
Would you believe that this whole
damn country is bein' held for ransom

946
01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:05,029
and we've got
till noon tomorrow to pay up?

947
01:37:05,111 --> 01:37:09,036
So that's it. Well, I'm sure
you won't be alone.

948
01:37:09,115 --> 01:37:11,709
An international auction,

949
01:37:11,784 --> 01:37:15,038
with nuclear supremacy
goin' to the highest bidder.

950
01:37:16,956 --> 01:37:20,335
Tell me, what does he need
to control that satellite?

951
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:23,012
A simple set of tapes
fed into a computer bank.

952
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:25,181
All he really needs is a building.

953
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:28,100
And these tapes? Large or small?

954
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:31,521
Conceivably any size.

955
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:34,099
From six inches to a cassette.

956
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:38,645
Assuming he's still using
your empire <i>as</i> a cover,

957
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:41,026
Blofeld could be anywhere on this map.

958
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:43,358
From Alaska to Florida.

959
01:37:43,441 --> 01:37:45,159
From Maine to Oregon.

960
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:48,283
From Texas to Baja California.

961
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:51,912
Baja?

962
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:55,837
I haven't got anything in Baja!

963
01:38:02,502 --> 01:38:05,346
<i>(newsreader) There is still
no official explanation</i>

964
01:38:05,421 --> 01:38:08,891
<i>of the apparent nuclear accidents
in North Dakota and Russia.</i>

965
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:13,437
<i>Presidential news secretary John Fenner
refused comment on a report</i>

966
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:17,108
<i>that an emergency meeting of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff is in session.</i>

967
01:38:17,183 --> 01:38:21,780
<i>It is believed the United States and the
Soviet Union have assured each other</i>

968
01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:24,778
<i>that no offensive action
has been taken by either nation.</i>

969
01:38:24,857 --> 01:38:29,328
<i>Reports of another nuclear accident
in Red China are as yet unconfirmed.</i>

970
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:33,951
Two more submarines have taken up
position not ten miles away.

971
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:36,502
Are those military aircraft
going to stand off forever?

972
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:40,502
What if they won't accept our ultimatum?
What if they attack?

973
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:45,257
Calm yourself, Metz. This farcical
show of force was only to be expected.

974
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:48,135
The Great Powers
flexing their military muscles

975
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:50,308
like so many impotent beach boys.

976
01:38:50,383 --> 01:38:55,389
I deeply regret my threat to destroy
a major city unless they give in,

977
01:38:55,471 --> 01:38:59,601
but the nuclear powers, like all bullies,
can only be intimidated by force.

978
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:03,188
- But how can you...
- They still have an hour left to reply.

979
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:08,027
One hour for both of us to achieve
our common dream: total disarmament

980
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:10,203
and peace for the world.

981
01:39:12,405 --> 01:39:15,659
- Sir, there's a single plane approaching.
- Range?

982
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:17,869
Two miles, and closing.

983
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,297
Stage One alert, please.

984
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:23,750
(controller) Command Centre.

985
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:25,801
<i>All crew to Stage One.</i>

986
01:39:25,877 --> 01:39:27,595
(klaxon)

987
01:39:28,671 --> 01:39:30,719
Up the top! Second platform!

988
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:35,057
There he is!

989
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:01,042
- (man) Aim!
- (Blofeld) Hold your fire!

990
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:21,315
<i>All recovery crew personnel,
proceed to docking level and stand by.</i>

991
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:35,204
Good morning, gentlemen!
The Acme Pollution Inspection.

992
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:39,455
We're cleaning up the world. We thought
this was a suitable starting point.

993
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:14,243
How disappointing! I expected
one head of state, at the very least.

994
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:17,071
Surely you haven't come
to negotiate, Mr Bond?

995
01:41:17,154 --> 01:41:20,704
Your pitiful little island
hasn't even been threatened.

996
01:41:20,783 --> 01:41:25,163
Search him from his toenails to the last
follicle on his head. Then bring him to me.

997
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:41,687
<i>("The British Grenadier")</i>

998
01:41:50,896 --> 01:41:53,024
I do so hate martial music.

999
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:58,446
As usual, Mr Bond,
you were absolutely right.

1000
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:03,456
You guessed correctly that that box
contained the satellite control tape

1001
01:42:03,534 --> 01:42:07,459
and you came aboard presumably
hoping to substitute this

1002
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:09,666
for the real thing.

1003
01:42:11,709 --> 01:42:16,135
So sorry to have ruined
the line of your suit for nothing.

1004
01:42:17,256 --> 01:42:20,726
(Bond) Talking about lines,
which one did you use on Miss Case?

1005
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:23,099
She has taken <i>a</i> reasonable attitude.

1006
01:42:23,179 --> 01:42:27,355
Like any sensible animal,
she's only threatening when threatened.

1007
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:31,984
Well, it appears that
you're holding all the aces.

1008
01:42:32,063 --> 01:42:35,988
- Right down to the dragon lady here.
- Jealousy? From you, Mr Bond?

1009
01:42:36,067 --> 01:42:38,115
I'm flattered.

1010
01:42:38,235 --> 01:42:40,784
As La Rochefoucauld observed:

1011
01:42:40,863 --> 01:42:44,083
"Humility is the worst form of conceit."

1012
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:46,502
I do hold the winning hand.

1013
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:51,417
Why don't you let me take you
on a little tour of our facilities?

1014
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:54,385
Your chance to see
the real tape once again.

1015
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:56,713
(Tiffany) Can I tag along, Ernst?

1016
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:02,515
I'd put something on
over that bikini first, my dear.

1017
01:43:02,718 --> 01:43:05,517
I've come too far
to have the aim of my crew

1018
01:43:05,596 --> 01:43:08,145
affected by the sight of a pretty body.

1019
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:10,313
No word yet from anyone!

1020
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:13,442
Hm. Only 12 minutes left.

1021
01:43:13,562 --> 01:43:17,783
Oh, well. I suppose
a little gentle prodding is called for.

1022
01:43:18,818 --> 01:43:23,244
As you see, Mr Bond,
the satellite is at present over

1023
01:43:23,322 --> 01:43:25,620
Kansas.

1024
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:31,043
Well, if we destroy Kansas, the world
may not hear about it for years.

1025
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:34,001
Perhaps New York.
All that smut and traffic.

1026
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,927
It would give them a chance
for a fresh start.

1027
01:43:37,002 --> 01:43:39,380
Washington, DC. Perfect.

1028
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:43,013
Since we have not heard from them,
they will hear from us.

1029
01:43:43,092 --> 01:43:45,971
- See to it, Metz.
- Er, Washington. Right.

1030
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:51,943
And this, presumably,
is the control bank with the coded tape.

1031
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:53,564
Right again, Mr Bond.

1032
01:43:53,644 --> 01:43:56,693
All satellites are controlled
by a coded tape.

1033
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:59,241
The trick is, of course, to have the code.

1034
01:43:59,316 --> 01:44:00,784
Obviously.

1035
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:05,787
It all seems so perfectly simple. I suppose
one just presses that and out it pops.

1036
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:11,913
Put it back, Mr Bond.

1037
01:44:11,996 --> 01:44:14,044
Immediately.

1038
01:44:20,129 --> 01:44:21,927
Hi, Ernst.

1039
01:44:22,006 --> 01:44:23,974
Is Superman giving you any trouble?

1040
01:44:24,049 --> 01:44:26,177
Put it back very carefully.

1041
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:34,898
You've suddenly
become tiresome, Mr Bond.

1042
01:44:35,019 --> 01:44:37,317
Target fixed! Commence countdown!

1043
01:44:37,396 --> 01:44:39,398
Ten minutes and counting!

1044
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:42,860
Take him away and throw him in the brig.

1045
01:44:43,861 --> 01:44:46,364
And search him again, just to make sure.

1046
01:44:54,371 --> 01:44:55,372
Bitch!

1047
01:44:58,751 --> 01:45:00,094
Come on!

1048
01:45:00,169 --> 01:45:02,547
Your problems are all behind you now.

1049
01:45:33,285 --> 01:45:34,958
(guard) Stop him!

1050
01:45:38,415 --> 01:45:41,259
<i>(controller) Nine minutes and counting.</i>

1051
01:45:46,715 --> 01:45:49,389
I did it. I switched the tape in the machine.

1052
01:45:49,468 --> 01:45:52,062
You stupid twit. You put
the real one back in.

1053
01:45:52,137 --> 01:45:54,231
Come on, let's go!

1054
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:16,624
A weather balloon!

1055
01:46:18,163 --> 01:46:21,713
- What do you think, Mr Letter?
- That must be the signal.

1056
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:25,968
There isn't a low-pressure area
within 200 miles of here. Let's go!

1057
01:46:27,965 --> 01:46:30,218
This is Charlie One to Squadron.

1058
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:34,351
<i>Charlie One to Squadron.
Ready all guns and proceed to target.</i>

1059
01:46:34,471 --> 01:46:36,769
<i>I repeat: proceed to target.</i>

1060
01:46:36,849 --> 01:46:39,022
<i>(pilot) Roger, Charlie One. Out.</i>

1061
01:46:39,476 --> 01:46:42,696
Come on, Bond. Get the hell off that rig.

1062
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:45,282
<i>(controller) Eight minutes and counting.</i>

1063
01:46:49,194 --> 01:46:53,574
Unidentified aircraft approaching rapidly.
Range five miles.

1064
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:55,751
But I... I don't understand!

1065
01:46:55,826 --> 01:46:59,547
- You said they wouldn't attack!
- The balloon was a signal.

1066
01:46:59,622 --> 01:47:03,502
The stupid fools must think
Mr Bond has accomplished his mission.

1067
01:47:03,584 --> 01:47:06,178
- Activate defences!
- Activate defences.

1068
01:47:08,547 --> 01:47:10,675

1069
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:21,189

1070
01:47:32,154 --> 01:47:33,997
This is Charlie One.

1071
01:47:34,073 --> 01:47:35,996
Commence attack!

1072
01:47:36,075 --> 01:47:38,203
<i>Commence attack!</i>

1073
01:47:49,046 --> 01:47:51,094
<i>(gunfire)</i>

1074
01:48:10,943 --> 01:48:13,162
Six minutes and counting.

1075
01:48:13,237 --> 01:48:14,864
Get them on the radio, Blofeldl

1076
01:48:14,947 --> 01:48:16,995
- Tell them we give up!
- Give up?

1077
01:48:17,074 --> 01:48:19,327
I've waited too long for this moment.

1078
01:48:19,410 --> 01:48:22,755
They'll pay dearly
for making a fool out of me.

1079
01:48:22,871 --> 01:48:26,341
(Metz) I see it all now.
You don't give a damn about peace!

1080
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:28,920
- All you care about...
- Shut up, Metz.

1081
01:48:30,879 --> 01:48:32,426
Tiffany, my dear.

1082
01:48:34,091 --> 01:48:37,561
We're showing a bit more cheek
than usual, aren't we?

1083
01:48:43,934 --> 01:48:47,029
Take her below and
lock her up with Mr Bond.

1084
01:48:47,104 --> 01:48:50,199
What a pity. Such nice cheeks, too.

1085
01:48:50,274 --> 01:48:52,572
If only they were brains.

1086
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:54,870
Destroy this, Metz.

1087
01:48:54,945 --> 01:48:57,073

Tell them we surrender!
This is utter madness!

1093
01:50:33,043 --> 01:50:36,764
One more word, Metz, and I'll
have you shot! Get back to your post!

1094
01:50:41,552 --> 01:50:43,850
Prepare my bathosub immediately.

1095
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:50,444
(machine-gun fire continues outside)

1096
01:50:52,855 --> 01:50:55,404

01:52:10,974 --> 01:52:13,523

01:52:15,812 --> 01:52:17,485

1125
01:54:23,774 --> 01:54:27,404
So long, James! I'll wire M
you're on your way home!

1126
01:54:27,486 --> 01:54:30,239
Don't tell him
which direction we've taken!

1127
01:54:30,322 --> 01:54:32,199
If you're havin' a good time,

1128
01:54:32,282 --> 01:54:36,458
let the captain know and
I'll have him steam around in circles!

1129
01:54:49,174 --> 01:54:54,226
James, there's something very important
I've been meaning to ask you

1130
01:54:54,304 --> 01:54:56,352
about us.

1131
01:54:56,431 --> 01:54:57,933
Oh?

1132
01:54:58,016 --> 01:55:02,567
I know in a relationship like ours, the
girl's not supposed to be the one to ask.

1133
01:55:02,646 --> 01:55:04,740
But I can't help it.

1134
01:55:04,815 --> 01:55:06,909
And please

1135
01:55:06,983 --> 01:55:09,077
think before answering.

1136
01:55:09,152 --> 01:55:11,246
That I promise.

1137
01:55:11,321 --> 01:55:14,165
- James...
- (knock at door)

1138
01:55:26,461 --> 01:55:29,806
There must be some mistake.
I didn't order anything.

1139
01:55:29,881 --> 01:55:31,975
No mistake, sir.

1140
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:36,851

the compliments of Mr Willard Whyte.

01:56:03,915 --> 01:56:06,964
That looks fantastic! What's in it?

1152
01:56:07,043 --> 01:56:10,513
Ah, but then there would be
no surprise, would there, madame?

1153
01:56:10,589 --> 01:56:13,559
- If madam would care to be seated.
- Thank you.

1154
01:56:13,675 --> 01:56:17,771
This will just take a moment,
and then we will leave you in peace.

1155
01:56:18,847 --> 01:56:20,645
Wine, sir?

1156
01:56:20,724 --> 01:56:22,852
Mouton Rothschild '55.

1157
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:26,439
- May we begin?
- (Bond) Please do.

1158
01:56:39,576 --> 01:56:41,704
A happy selection, if I may say.

1159
01:56:41,786 --> 01:56:43,880
I'll be the judge of that.

1160
01:56:43,955 --> 01:56:47,505
That's rather potent.
Not the cork - your aftershave.

1161
01:56:47,584 --> 01:56:50,258
Strong enough to bury anything.

1162
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:56,184
But the wine is quite excellent.

1163
01:56:56,259 --> 01:57:00,309
Although, for such a grand meal,
I had rather expected a claret.

1164
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:02,558
(Wint) Of course.

1165
01:57:02,641 --> 01:57:06,771
Unfortunately, our cellar
is rather poorly stocked with clarets.

1166
01:57:08,104 --> 01:57:11,108
Mouton Rothschild is a claret.

1167
01:57:12,734 --> 01:57:17,160
And I've smelt that aftershave before.
And both times I've smelt a rat.

01:57:33,588 --> 01:57:35,181
(Kidd cries out)

1169
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:44,145

Whoaaaah!

1172
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:22,020
Well, he certainly left
with his tails between his legs.

1173
01:58:23,054 --> 01:58:25,148
Oh, James!

1174
01:58:25,223 --> 01:58:27,817
Oh, yes. What were you about to ask me?

1175
01:58:29,019 --> 01:58:31,113
James...

1176
01:58:31,187 --> 01:58:34,361
