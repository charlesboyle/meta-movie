00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:05,164
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON 21 JUMP STREET</i>

2
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:08,000
<i>You're a fucking nerd.</i>

3
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:10,102
<i>Boy, you lucky
you even graduating.</i>

4
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:11,603
<i>- Fuck!
- Oh!</i>

5
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,505
<i>You're good at this, huh?
Yeah.</i>

6
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,441
<i>You're really good at this.
Yeah.</i>

7
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:16,563
<i>Hey, you want to be friends?</i>

8
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,252
<i>Yours isn't loaded, right?</i>

9
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,749
<i>Just touch it.
I'm scared.</i>

10
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,018
<i>Just touch it.</i>

11
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,700
<i>Seriously. All right,
all right, all right.</i>

12
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,789
<i>You took a bullet for me, man.</i>

13
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:31,791
<i>You shot me in the dick!</i>

14
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,227
<i>Boom, motherfuckers!</i>

15
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,463
<i>You two sons of bitches
are going to college!</i>

16
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:47,272
Yin is characterized
as slow, soft, passive

17
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,942
and is associated with
water and femininity.

18
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:54,346
<i>While, Yang, by contrast,
is fast and solid and...</i>

19
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,582
Man, this is BS.

20
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:59,518
I thought we were going
to actual college,
not online college.

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,753
Listening for
coded messages
in lectures.

22
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:02,754
What are you talking about?

23
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:03,756
Look around.

24
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,824
This is our city.

25
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:06,959
What do we want to
be in college for?

26
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,193
You're right.

27
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,762
Partners for life.

28
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,765
<i>At Metro city port,</i>
<i>the tide comes in</i>
<i>at 10:30 A.M.</i>

29
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,434
<i>Then it will return to the sea.</i>

30
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:17,469
Metro port.
One hour.

31
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,406
Let's do this.

32
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,484
Surprise.
There's two more arms.

33
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,939
- Shit! That's the ghost.
- The ghost?

34
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,440
Joste nillsen,

35
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,309
biggest trafficker of
illegal goods in Metro city.

36
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,278
He teamed up with
a Mexican cartel

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,013
and they're running
all this shit
through the port.

38
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:01,980
What the hell
are we supposed
to be buying?

39
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:02,982
I don't know.

40
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,685
What are you doing?
Huh?

41
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,320
I got a new identity
that's gonna be killer.

42
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,042
I'll be throwing it to you
to make it legit.

43
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,624
Okay.

44
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,393
I'm gonna need you
to improvise. Okay?

45
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:15,594
I don't want to improvise.

46
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,396
I'm gonna need you to improvise.

47
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,131
I suck at improvising.
I don't want to do it.

48
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,733
I need absolute silence
while I fall into character.

49
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,603
I need absolute silence
while I fall into character.

50
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,406
Can you give me
a head start on...

51
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:29,875
I need absolute...
I need absolute silence.

52
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,277
Can you please...
Absolute silence.

53
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,962
Are you fucking
serious right now?

54
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,366
All right.
I hate people who are late.

55
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,471
We're trying to
see that product.

56
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,839
Shit!

57
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,942
Yo, sleepy!
What's up, homie?

58
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,811
You know my cousin, sad boy.

59
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,813
I think you got
the wrong guy, homes.

60
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:10,115
Oh, that's bullshit, man!
You sleepy!

61
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,650
Everyone say in the barrio,

62
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,486
sleepy, he like
the Mexican Wolverine and shit.

63
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,455
Hey, my partner here,
he want to see the product.

64
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,589
Why ain't he talking?

65
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,827
My name is Jeff.

66
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,796
That's <i> jeffe,</i> man.

67
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,200
Tell 'em about
mousie's <i> quinceanera,</i> man.

68
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:31,603
Tell 'em about
that crazy adventure you guys had.

69
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,940
I don't know what
you're talking about.

70
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,509
Oh, man, when you were
telling the story last night,

71
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,511
you had so much detail!

72
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,713
The detail was so rich! It was rich detail!

73
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,383
Go into incredibly
descriptive details

74
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,684
of the story, so we all know.

75
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,953
Oh, yes.

76
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,757
It was Dora and Diego

77
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,292
and swiper.

78
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:54,993
Swiper?

79
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,595
Who was that you
choked out, man?

80
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,530
He had it coming!
Who was that?

81
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,800
Boots.

82
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,137
No, man, that wasn't boots!
Boots isn't a real name!

83
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,305
You got to tell them
the real story, man.

84
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,273
Start over from the top.

85
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:11,376
That's a made-up name.

86
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:15,047
I can't believe the punks
I have to deal with these days.

87
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,688
It really makes me
miss the '90s,

88
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,691
when we had
professionals around.

89
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,075
You want to check out the goods?

90
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,798
Check it out.

91
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,035
And shut up. Right?

92
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,770
Where'd you find
this gringo, man?

93
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,540
At the fucking Mumford & sons concert
and shit?

94
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,585
What is it?
Guns? Drugs?

95
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,388
No! No!

96
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,957
Dude!
It's gross!

97
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,826
It's inking in my mouth!

98
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,462
I'll get it off.

99
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:06,565
Its tentacle is eating me!

100
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,533
It's so strong!
It's really on there, man.

101
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,668
It's biting my face!

102
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,172
Shit!

103
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,908
Black market exotic animals,
just like we expected to be in there.

104
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,976
The accents are gone, huh?

105
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,846
Take them out, guys.
They're cops.

106
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,276
What was that?
I don't know!
I think we're moving.

107
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,726
We're definitely moving!

108
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,294
There's fucking
birds and shit in here!

109
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,462
There's actual shit!

110
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,431
What the fuck?

111
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,867
There's a fucking
dragon in here!

112
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,029
Shit!

113
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:46,872
What was that?

114
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,476
Dude, that was our car.

115
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,712
We shared so much in that car!

116
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:57,382
I'm going to shoot
them in the face for that!
That was our fucking car!

117
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,384
What are you doing?

118
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,219
Don't <i> teen wolf</i> on the truck!

119
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,354
Don't leave me here alone!

120
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:03,388
Then get up here!

121
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,823
I can't do that!

122
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,759
Then fucking climb around.
Come on, climb around.

123
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,795
Let's go.
Come on, buddy.
You got it.

124
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:10,829
This is so scary!

125
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:11,897
Shoot him!

126
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,465
Don't leave me out here!

127
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,400
I'm all out.
You stupid moron!

128
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,562
That's it. Come on.

129
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,472
Fucking get up here.
Come on.
Fuck!

130
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,807
All right, you good?
Yeah!

131
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,509
All you got to do is walk now, okay?
Okay.

132
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,845
Shit!

133
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,649
What the fuck are you doing?
Get up here!

134
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,417
I can't!

135
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,252
All right, fine,
I guess I'll just drag you.

136
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,787
I'm gonna die!

137
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,423
You're not gonna die.
Just get the fuck up here!

138
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,696
Pull yourself up here.

139
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,598
Use your core!

140
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,902
You got it, you got it.
Come on, come on.
Yeah!

141
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:51,636
All right.
Think you can stand on your own now?

142
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,038
Yes!

143
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
I think we lost them.

144
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,107
Shit!

145
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,530
He's the fucking Terminator!

146
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,278
That's fucking dangerous!

147
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,784
You are under arrest!

148
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,819
Pull the truck over!

149
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,988
I said pull the fucking truck over
right fucking now!

150
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,724
You owe me a car,

151
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,226
and it'd better be a fucking Lamborghini,
you bitch!

152
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:15,560
I did it!

153
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,962
You have the right
to remain silent.

154
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,330
Oh, shit!

155
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,405
Holy Moses!

156
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,773
Shit.

157
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,576
What happened?

158
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:32,778
I think they got away.

159
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,650
Is that a hickey?

160
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:43,788
Oh. This was actually
an octopus-related incident.

161
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:48,860
I'd opened a crate
and the octopus had
leapt onto my face.

162
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,663
Apparently, they have
many, many arms.

163
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,098
They have eight tentacles.

164
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,466
Yes, and...

165
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,434
Look, ladies,

166
00:08:56,436 --> 00:09:00,872
nobody gave a shit about
the jump street reboot
when you first came on.

167
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,941
Anyone with half a brain,
myself included,

168
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,744
thought it was destined
to fail spectacularly.

169
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,312
But you got lucky.

170
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,080
So now this department
has invested

171
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:13,118
a lot of money to make sure
jump street keeps going.

172
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,353
We've doubled their budget.

173
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:18,189
As if spending twice the money
guaranteed twice the profit.

174
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,593
Like that's going to work.

175
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:25,864
Yeah. Well,
the commissioner's convinced
this debacle happened

176
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,600
because you weren't
doing the same
undercover student thing

177
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,001
you did the first time.

178
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,337
She doesn't get
that it's always worse

179
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,339
the second time around.

180
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,207
You settle into
worn-out roles.

181
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,877
One gets possessive,
the other runs away.

182
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,079
You begin a slow,
painful unraveling,

183
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,615
as all the good things
that came before

184
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:47,052
begin to be crushed
by the trash compactor of sadness.

185
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,221
That doesn't sound like us.
I mean...

186
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,890
I'm getting a divorce.

187
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,528
We don't want to
do the same thing.

188
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,930
We want to burst
through our ceiling.

189
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,265
And you're gonna
find another ceiling

190
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,800
and you got to
bust through that one,

191
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:02,601
and you just got to
keep hammering ceilings.

192
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,502
Okay, okay, okay.

193
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,172
What if we actually went
into the secret service

194
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,640
and, like, tried to
protect the white house?

195
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,809
I think...
I don't think that would work.

196
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,544
I'm going to ask you
to stop talking.

197
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:13,979
I thought it was
a pretty good idea.

198
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:17,716
Do the same thing as last time,
everyone's happy.

199
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,655
I can't believe
the Koreans bought
their church back.

200
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,423
Yeah. Good thing
there was an even bigger

201
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,158
abandoned church
directly across the street.

202
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,829
Yeah. That's convenient.
Yes, it is convenient.

203
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,364
Next year, we'll probably
just be right back across the street.

204
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:33,765
Just next door.

205
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,600
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

206
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,868
We're not ahead of ourselves.

207
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,110
We're right next to each other.

208
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,109
This is awesome.
Like, way more expensive for no reason.

209
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,044
Look at dickson's office.

210
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:49,247
Looks like a giant cube of ice.

211
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,749
How you bitches
like jump street now?

212
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,050
Hey!

213
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,719
Y'all see this shit?

214
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,689
22 jump street is the lick.

215
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,224
And I got
a big-ass raise

216
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,726
to babysit
you two fuckers again.

217
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,162
Designed it myself.
We got an espresso bar.

218
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,964
I'm thinking about
a shark tank over there.

219
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,432
Ooh, I like sharks.

220
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:11,202
Fuck a 21 jump street,
and fuck a Korean Jesus.

221
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,104
Whoa! Cap, come on,
Korean Jesus is right there.

222
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,739
That's Vietnamese Jesus.

223
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,941
See, this a Vietnamese church.

224
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:20,345
You racist,
sacrilegious sack of shit.

225
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:25,116
Look at that.
Vietnamese Jesus just dripping swagoo.

226
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,651
And we got some
new dumb-ass interns.

227
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,119
Hey, hey! Look alive!
Huh?

228
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,321
Boys.
Yo, jenko.

229
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,060
Hey, Schmidt!

230
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,699
Don't do that.

231
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,801
So, they want the same shit,
so here we go.

232
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,170
Same identities.

233
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,139
Same assignment.

234
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,641
We're going back to high school?

235
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,576
Your ass look like you about 50.

236
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,111
You're going to MC state.

237
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:54,746
We're going to college for real?

238
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:58,216
Somebody's out there,
they're cooking up a new drug.

239
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,252
It's Adderall mixed with ecstasy mixed
with God knows what else.

240
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,888
Wipey?

241
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,157
No, you dumb motherfucker.
Whyphy.

242
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,627
Stands for work hard? Yes.
Play hard? Yes.

243
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,396
Now, these kids take this shit,

244
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:15,066
and they get laser-focused
for about four hours of studying,

245
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,169
and then they party
like it's goddamn 1999.

246
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,338
Who's this?

247
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,906
That's Cynthia Watson.

248
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,742
She was a student at MC state.

249
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:24,976
She took some whyphy,

250
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,244
got locked out of her dorm,

251
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,479
ended up falling off the roof.

252
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,514
And now she's dead.

253
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,953
That's her buying drugs
on campus.

254
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,654
And that's the dealer.

255
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,857
Find him and we find
the supplier.

256
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,726
Sir, can I just say,

257
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:45,597
it is so refreshing
to have a case
with a black victim.

258
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,299
I mean,
we care so much more
because she's black.

259
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,568
I think what he's
really trying to say

260
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,371
is that we care equally.

261
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,541
It's a tie, really,
how much we care.

262
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:00,078
Uh... no, we're not.
If it was a white person,
I wouldn't even care.

263
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,800
One less cracker-ass
cracker to worry about.

264
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,484
Why every time
you speak I want to
throw the fuck up?

265
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,387
Infiltrate the dealer,
find the supplier.

266
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,565
You all right?

267
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Yeah.

268
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,402
It's just...

269
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:30,275
I'm the first person
in my family to pretend
to go to college.

270
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,110
Best part is we get to
do it together.

271
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,246
What's up, college?

272
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,648
What's up, bro?
We're 322.

273
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,715
Fuck high school, right?

274
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:38,850
Fuck high school.

275
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,052
Oh, so tight!

276
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,888
Oh, this is so baller!

277
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,890
Beds... oh, shit.

278
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,159
Oh, dope.
That looks like cum.

279
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,828
That's cum.
Okay. All right.

280
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,310
Already got cum on
the mattress, dawg.

281
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,432
Welcome to college.
Fuck, yeah.

282
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,309
Hilarious shirt that
signals we drink alcohol.

283
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,247
Some bacon machine
that my mom got me.

284
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:10,582
I do not understand
how it works.

285
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,226
It's true.

286
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,588
Super high-tech
police gear.

287
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,097
Carte Blanche with
the budget, motherfucker.

288
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,869
I'm going to veto that poster.

289
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,371
It's a touch childish.

290
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,107
Okay. What do lambos have to
do with touching children?

291
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,276
Lambos are lame.

292
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,112
I get one choice.
I get one thing
that I'm not...

293
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,881
We have to agree.
You know what I mean?

294
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,383
What up, fellas? We're your
across-the-hall neighbors.

295
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,351
Oh, hey,
there's two of you.
You're twins.

296
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:47,485
What's up, man?

297
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,854
We're the yangs, man.
Kenny Yang. What's up?

298
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,189
Keith Yang.

299
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,523
What's going on?
What's going on?

300
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,691
Did you say the yangs?

301
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,293
Yeah, dad's Chinese, man.

302
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,528
Our mom's not Chinese.
She's black.

303
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,997
Oh.
She's like real black.

304
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,632
Like Wesley snipes black.
Exactly.

305
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:01,666
We're brothers, too.

306
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,769
No. He's not kidding.
He's serious.

307
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,170
Oh, really?

308
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,605
What?
Like, one of
y'all older?

309
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,307
Mmm-hmm.

310
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,174
Yeah, 'cause you got
crow's feet under
your eyes, man.

311
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,876
You specifically.

312
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,646
We're actually just
normal college age.

313
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:16,314
I mean, even if
you're a little older,
that's cool, man,

314
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,615
because, you know,
girls here love older dudes.

315
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:18,917
That's true.

316
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,785
Plus, there's mad
fuckable girls here.

317
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,720
Mad fuckable.
Especially
during spring break.

318
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,923
I love spring break.
But I do have to say,

319
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,424
I've fucked
a thousand girls by now

320
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,692
and I don't know,
at the end of the day,

321
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:28,960
you just kind of want something

322
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,061
that's just
a little deeper really.

323
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,932
Yeah, balls deeper.
Jinx. Buy me a coke.

324
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,335
Oh, snap, we're still
saying the same thing.
This is amazing!

325
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:40,271
Carrots. Pumpernickels.
Glow sticks. Twins!

326
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,173
That's dope, dude.
That's so sick.

327
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:45,443
That's crazy. We have that
brother connection, too.

328
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,811
You ready?
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

329
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,513
Pirates! Baby feet!
Paper clips! Bananas!

330
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,481
Sun! Anger!
I don't know! Words!

331
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:51,716
Quicksand!
Shoes!

332
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,117
Boom!

333
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,552
That's hip-hop, man.
Awesome.

334
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:55,554
That's great.

335
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,056
It's gonna be super fun.

336
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,178
All right?
Same as last time.

337
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,060
Dude, if it's like last time,

338
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,928
you're gonna have
an awesome time,
and it's gonna suck for me.

339
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,596
No. You're gonna have
an awesome time, too,

340
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,165
because I'm gonna
make sure of it.

341
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,633
You took a bullet for me.

342
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,202
That's right,
I did, and it sucked,
but I'd do it again.

343
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,404
No way. It's my turn.
I owe you a life debt.

344
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,505
Co-ed bathrooms.

345
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,307
What? Oh, shit.

346
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,077
I'm not gonna take a shit

347
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:19,944
the entire time I'm here.

348
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,179
I know.

349
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,614
Hey.
How you doing?

350
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,950
Hey.

351
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:28,686
What's up?
'Sup?

352
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,788
Just exhausted from
inventing Facebook

353
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,124
or whatever website
people our age use.

354
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,129
They still have books?

355
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,198
I thought they just
put the books
inside the computers.

356
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,734
Yeah, I guess the kids
just use the stacks
to hide and have sex.

357
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,736
So we'll go to all
Cynthia's classes
and activities,

358
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:46,137
ask around about the drug

359
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,772
and find out who the dealer is.

360
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,040
Yeah, it's just like last time.

361
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,908
Exactly like last time.

362
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,076
Dude, in human sexuality,

363
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,644
do you get to fuck

364
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,206
or do you just get
to watch people fuck?

365
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:56,781
Neither.

366
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,670
What the fuck am I
taking it for, then?

367
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,989
Now, obviously,
we've all heard
this statement before,

368
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,726
I've got a first
impression for you.

369
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,064
Oh, y'all like psychology?

370
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,399
Tracy Morgan.

371
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,203
Nobody?

372
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,640
Work hard,
play hard, am I right?

373
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,946
You looking for some whyphy?

374
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,048
Yeah, man, that'd be sick.

375
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,682
Go to the police station,

376
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,451
walk in and ask your captain
to see the evidence room

377
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:34,613
'cause you're a fucking narc.

378
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,355
I think you're mistaken.

379
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,323
You're literally
wearing your badge.

380
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:40,291
Did you really just check to see

381
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,359
if you were wearing your badge?

382
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,361
This guy's a fucking cop.

383
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,128
I didn't look down.

384
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,368
Wait, Professor Jacobs,
doesn't history happen
a long time ago?

385
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,203
Well, history happens...

386
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:55,306
This class is such a gut.

387
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,207
Hey, you guys play football?

388
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,209
No, this is actually my laptop.

389
00:17:58,211 --> 00:17:59,491
Yeah, I'm taking
notes right now.

390
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,313
I'm kidding.
It's a football.

391
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,315
Mr. mcquaid?

392
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,683
Covalent bonds.

393
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:12,423
What has been the result
of the war on drugs?

394
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,592
Why would you ask me?
I'm not a cop.

395
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,595
Because this is
a college seminar,

396
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,064
and that's how
college seminars work.

397
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:23,634
Professor gets into
a lively conversation
with the student.

398
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,771
Friction creates fire,
and that leads to
lessons learned.

399
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,039
Well, it's definitely
harder to get drugs.

400
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,607
I can personally tell you that.

401
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,576
The average price of cocaine

402
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,545
has dropped 70%
in the last 30 years.

403
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:37,187
Then your dealer's
probably selling you
some pretty stepped-on shit.

404
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:41,452
Mr. mcquaid, college is
a wonderful place.

405
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:45,022
This is where
you get to decide
who you actually are,

406
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,725
instead of the person
that you're clearly
pretending to be right now,

407
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,161
which everyone
sees through,
by the way.

408
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:53,664
You got to decide,
do I just keep
doing the same thing,

409
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,100
or am I gonna
choose a different path

410
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,602
and question my convictions?

411
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,705
I don't have any
prior convictions.

412
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,309
Why are you saying this stuff?

413
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,448
That's exactly
the answer I wanted,
Mr. mcquaid!

414
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,884
I want you to question
what I'm saying.

415
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,219
This is the basis
of this whole course,

416
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,821
and that's the beauty
of college.

417
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,389
You can say whatever you want.

418
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,057
You can be whatever you want.

419
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,894
I mean, I have tenure.
I can really say
whatever I want.

420
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,595
George Washington
was a black lesbian.

421
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,430
The Eiffel tower
is made of dildos.

422
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,199
They can't fire me.
I'm indestructible.

423
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,801
I'm sleeping with
two of my students.

424
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,069
Her and her.
I actually am.

425
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,138
Now, just like you did before,

426
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,742
I want you right now
to say whatever you want.

427
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,377
Say whatever you want.

428
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,913
Fieto.

429
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:45,183
Fieto, not a word,
but I'm gonna accept it.

430
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,152
You can do whatever you want
with your life, Mr. mcquaid.

431
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,121
The only way you can
fail this class

432
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,523
is by not becoming
who you truly are.

433
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,792
Please respond to my text.

434
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,798
Okay,
we got time for just
one more improve game.

435
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
For this one,
we need a ton of
different suggestions.

436
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,036
So, we just need you guys
to fill in the blank

437
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,637
in a sentence that
we're gonna set up.

438
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,373
So it'll go like this.
Oh, I'm so hungry,
I wish I had a...

439
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,342
Tampon!
Okay, but we want...

440
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,710
We want it to be actual food

441
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,145
so that it, like,
makes sense
with the game.

442
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:17,081
It's more fun that way.
So, uh, let's try it
one more time.

443
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,116
Oh, I've got to get home
so I can feed my...

444
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,651
Boner!

445
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:21,953
You know what?
Let's just play
the game, okay?

446
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,388
All right, so what would you...

447
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,856
Hey, that girl's
in my psych class.

448
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,258
Damn, she's hot.
Go talk to her.

449
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,759
You come talk to her with me.

450
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,462
Stop being a pussy
and go talk to her. Go.

451
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,763
<i>All right, all right.</i>

452
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,832
<i>Coming to the stage, we got...</i>

453
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:38,970
<i>J. Bohnes, aka...</i>

454
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:41,072
Hey.
Hi.

455
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,554
I think we're in
the same psych class.

456
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,642
Oh, yeah. Hi.

457
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,244
Yeah.

458
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:51,115
<i>Pills! Pills!
Bills! Pills!</i>

459
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:54,619
<i>Bills! A sign of
the times that rhymes</i>

460
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,487
<i>Amanda Bynes</i>

461
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:59,156
<i>drop that raggedy Andy circus</i>

462
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,058
<i>circle jerkus...</i>

463
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,027
You guys are
the improve guys, right?
Yeah.

464
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,428
That's cool.

465
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,230
You're the guy with
the terrible suggestions.

466
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,933
Yeah, yeah.
You're welcome, man.
Yeah.

467
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:12,236
<i>Thanks, guys.</i>
<i>Um, lady J is gonna</i>
<i>be up next for you.</i>

468
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,639
Cynthia, that girl who died,

469
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:15,840
she used to come here
all the time, right?

470
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,074
Mmm.

471
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,877
This piece is called <i> areolas.</i>

472
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,346
Did you know her?

473
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,315
Yeah, she lived
across the hall from me.

474
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,750
Yeah?
So why do you care so much?

475
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,352
I'm... I'm writing a...

476
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,588
<i>Greedy man hands!</i>

477
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,157
...a slam poem
in her honor.

478
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,759
Early stages, very early stages.

479
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,060
Oh, really?
Yeah, yeah.

480
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:37,561
Wouldn't it be better

481
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,130
just to, like,
plan the stuff out
ahead of time,

482
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,800
and then not say it
in front of people
and embarrass yourself?

483
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:46,237
That's a thing
that people do.
That's stand-up comedy.

484
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,371
That's probably
what you should do,

485
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:49,073
because that stuff's funny.

486
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:53,010
<i>My brown nipple</i>
<i>will produce white milk</i>
<i>during lactation...</i>

487
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,612
What do you think of this?

488
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,614
I actually think
it's really powerful.

489
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:58,149
That's cool that you said that,

490
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,351
'cause I actually thought it
was really powerful, too,

491
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:03,020
when the one girl
was talking about
her nips and shit.

492
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:08,426
<i>Okay, does anybody</i>
<i>have anything</i>
<i>they want to share?</i>

493
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:09,760
Let's see what you got.

494
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,395
<i>Any more poets in the audience?</i>

495
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:12,797
I...
I mean, do you
really do poetry?

496
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,799
I do, and I will.

497
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,167
I got somebody.
What?

498
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,969
<i>Okay, we got somebody.
All right, give it up, guys.</i>

499
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,371
Yeah!
Okay.

500
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:21,639
Just go up there.
All right, okay.

501
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:22,807
Okay.
No pressure.

502
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:23,849
You'll see,
it's good.
Yeah!

503
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,681
<i>Um...</i>

504
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,752
<i>This is a work in progress.</i>

505
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:37,822
<i>So, uh...</i>

506
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,562
<i>Slam poetry!</i>

507
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,464
<i>Yelling!</i>

508
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,165
<i>Angry!</i>

509
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,770
<i>Waving my hands a lot!</i>

510
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:54,972
<i>Specific point of view on things</i>

511
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,007
<i>Cynthia!</i>

512
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,478
<i>Cynthia</i>

522
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:29,273
<i>You're dead</i>

523
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,144
<i>that's for Cynthia, who's dead.</i>

524
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,017
Whoo!

525
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,192
I don't have a single lead.

526
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:51,028
I do. I hear you can
get whyphy on campus
anywhere 24/7.

527
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,899
Do you think they mean
whyphy the drug

528
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:55,941
or WI-Fi like
the Internet?

529
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:58,869
What...

530
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,339
Fuck you, brain.

531
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:05,509
How did we find
the dealers so easy
the first time?

532
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,011
Well, his number was
literally on a sticker.

533
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,013
Well, let's go find
this guy's sticker.

534
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:10,781
I don't think this guy
does stickers.

535
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,717
Well, we need help.
We need to consult
an expert.

536
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,686
Yo, dude, you shot
him in the dick, dude.

537
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:16,754
I got him
in the dick.
Yep.

538
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,190
Shot him in the dick.

539
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,529
If it isn't
Turner and hooch,
in the flesh.

540
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:27,998
Holy shit, you are looking fit.

541
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,436
Hey, you should get
some tips from this guy.

542
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:35,172
He's looking good.
Look at those
pectoral muscles.

543
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,241
That's the kind of definition
I want out of you, man.

544
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:39,076
What's up, Eric?
Hey.

545
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,645
Mr. Walters,
we should, um...

546
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,180
Or I should apologize for, uh...

547
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,117
For shooting my penis off?

548
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,486
Yeah.
Yeah.

549
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,822
Don't sweat it, brother.
I'm liberated. Totally.

550
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,064
You know they gave me a vagina?

551
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,693
It's awesome.
You guys want
to see it?

552
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,761
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no.

553
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,930
That's fine.
All right.
Eric's seen it.

554
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,266
Eric's been all
up in that shit.
Isn't that right, Eric?

555
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:03,734
You guys got to get me
the fuck out of here.

556
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:04,768
Hey, guess what.

557
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,770
I'm Eric's bitch.

558
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,404
No, you're not.

559
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,206
Yes! I am!

560
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:10,875
I'm your bitch.

561
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,545
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry, honey.

562
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:16,914
I didn't mean that.
You know that, right?

563
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,883
I am such a bitch
when aunt Flo shows up.

564
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:21,886
It bleeds so much, it's crazy.

565
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:24,288
It's like
the elevator doors opening
in <i> the shining.</i>

566
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,957
Your vagina doesn't
fucking work, man.

567
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,627
Worked for you last night.

568
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:32,963
You are
so clearly forcing Eric
into this relationship.

569
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,032
Eric, am I forcing you
into anything?

570
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,268
Yes.
See?

571
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,669
Look, they sent us
in undercover
at a college

572
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:40,304
to find the dealer
of this new synthetic,

573
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:42,339
and no one will
tell us anything.

574
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,608
That's 'cause
you guys look like
fucking narcs, all right?

575
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,210
College kids
aren't dumb like Eric.

576
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,845
I was supposed
to go to Berkeley.

577
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,581
Well,
they gave us a picture,
so we do have that.

578
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:51,749
Well, that's your lead,
motherfucker!

579
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,651
That's what you start with.

580
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:55,619
I know,
but we can't see his face,
so we don't know who it is.

581
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:57,655
We don't know who it is.

582
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:59,723
I'm Schmidt. My pants
are filled with doody.

583
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,792
That's you.

584
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:03,194
That doesn't sound
anything like me.

585
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,596
You sort of sound like that.

586
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:06,764
That doesn't sound
anything like me.

587
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:07,831
That doesn't sound
anything like me.

588
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,266
It's not not you.

589
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:13,237
Eric! Close your eyes
and tell me who's
talking right now.

590
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:16,974
That's Schmidt
being a little bitch.

591
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:18,542
That's just not
a good impression.

592
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:19,743
Whoa!

593
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,679
Nice job, super sleuths.

594
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:22,980
Did you even
bother to look at
the fucking picture?

595
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,015
Yeah.
Huh?

596
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,297
There's a reflection right here.

597
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,987
Your fucking guy's got a tattoo.

598
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:33,557
Find the tattoo,
find the dealer.

599
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,728
Fuck, man, I don't know.
I do a lot of stupid
tattoos to drunk kids.

600
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,063
Do you remember
that stupid tattoo?

601
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:40,931
A bazooka?

602
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:44,535
Think I might have did it
on a football player.

603
00:26:44,537 --> 00:26:45,903
Guy with a red Mohawk.
I don't know.

604
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:47,771
They all start to
look the same to me.

605
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,607
I think I know exactly
who he's talking about.

606
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,378
Fuck you!

607
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,981
Fuck you,
you little walk-on fuck!

608
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:58,782
I can't, like, move around
in these things.

609
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,451
God,
I love walk-on day!

610
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:01,453
Fuck, yeah.

611
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,489
That's a weird time
to be q-tipping.

612
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:08,325
You're all fucking pussies!

613
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:10,260
Dude, you don't
have to do this.
What?

614
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:11,829
I just don't want
you to get hurt.
I'm not gonna get...

615
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:12,963
Whoops.

616
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,264
Shit. Whoa.

617
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,833
Dude, I am so sorry.

618
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:16,934
It's all right, man.
Don't worry about it, man.

619
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:18,402
Are you sure?
All right...
Yeah. Ow.

620
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:20,471
Shit.
I got it.

621
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:21,705
Okay, I got it, I got it.

622
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,307
Ow!
That's fine.

623
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,875
I'll get it.
No, no, let me get it,
let me get it.

624
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:26,276
No, I got it.
Let me just get it.
No, let me get it.

625
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,312
I got it, I got it.
Let's just...

626
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,048
Dude, I'm sorry.
I got my q-tip
in your meat, bro.

627
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,050
No, man, I got my...
I got my meat
in your q-tip.

628
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:35,319
It's like a whole
new type of sandwich.

629
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,287
Like, a meat q-tip.

630
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,289
Like a meat-qute.

631
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,126
That's funny.

632
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,728
Hey, you guys want
some of this sandwich?

633
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,129
It's a meat-qute
sandwich.

634
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:47,398
Me and this guy are
having a meat-qute.

635
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,035
You're hilarious, dude.
What's your name?

636
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:53,070
Brad. Wait...
Brad.

637
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:54,405
Uh, yeah, yeah, it's Brad.

638
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:55,839
I'm Zook.
Nice to meet you.
Zook.

639
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,808
Nice to meet you, too, man.

640
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,810
Blue 20!

641
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,413
Blue 20!

642
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,381
Set, hut!

643
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:27,604
You love walk-on day now?

644
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,683
Your arm all right?
You want to take
that sleeve off?

645
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,380
No, I'm good.

646
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,684
Dude, holy shit, bro.
Great fucking catch, dude.

647
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:44,455
If you see that
safety line up that deep,
though, hit me quicker.

648
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:46,356
Oh, yeah, I didn't know
you had wheels
like that, bro.

649
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,058
It's funny, 'cause
he's my brother. So...

650
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,194
Um...

651
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:53,931
Hey, uh, you know, we have
this rush party at zeta.

652
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,800
But I thought, you know,
you could come by
and meet the guys.

653
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:58,302
It'd be really fun, I think.

654
00:28:58,304 --> 00:28:59,436
Great.
Yeah, maybe we will.

655
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,606
Are you guys, like, together?

656
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,508
Yeah.
Yeah, this is my bro.

657
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,044
That's...
Funny, dude. You're funny.

658
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,012
Oh.

659
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,714
Uh, really?
Wow. Um, okay.

660
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,483
Yeah, man, sure.
You, too, you can come, too.

661
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:13,917
We'll see what we can do.

662
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,052
Also, I said
a bunch of stuff earlier

663
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:16,186
that you didn't acknowledge...

664
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,055
Great catch.
Cool, yeah.

665
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:19,156
See you then.
So you won't
address that?

666
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:20,624
What the fuck's up
with that guy?

667
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:22,526
All we have to do now
is rush the frat
long enough

668
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:25,295
to confirm that
rooster has that
bazooka tattoo.

669
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,364
Look, man, do you think
it's cool if you come?

670
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,533
'Cause, I mean, he kind of
really just asked me.

671
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:30,601
I just don't want to start off

672
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:31,883
on the wrong foot with this guy.

673
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:36,206
Dude, you're tripping.
We do everything together.

674
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,841
You should lose
the puka shells, though.

675
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:40,210
Things are different
since you didn't
go to college.

676
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,347
Yo, Brad!
What's up, dude?

677
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,716
Same puka, dude.

678
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:47,017
You got the same...
Puka bros.

679
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,259
Holy shit!

680
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,454
Look at him,
it's, like, all the same.

681
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:51,955
Dude, you wear pants, too?

682
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,024
What? Bros, man.
Dude.

683
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,626
I knew we were gonna be
connected, just like that.

684
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,094
Yeah, why don't you guys
just tie your dicks together

685
00:29:57,096 --> 00:29:57,895
and get married, right, rooster?

686
00:29:57,897 --> 00:29:59,930
Rooster. What's up, bro?

687
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:01,431
You look good, man.

688
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,766
What's up, rooster?

689
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,434
How you doing, man?
Digging the puka.

690
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:05,769
Thanks, dude. I can't
believe it's the same...

691
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,070
How you doing, rooster?

692
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:08,205
Rooster is getting some pop.

693
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:09,447
Why don't you go check him out?

694
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,318
You in the zone, bro?
In the fucking zone,
dude.

695
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,951
Hey. What's up?

696
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,920
What's up? I'm rooster.

697
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,755
Oh, yeah, no.

698
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:26,089
We've met before.

699
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,524
Oh, really? I don't
remember that at all.

700
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:29,459
You must just have
a really plain face.

701
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,261
Yeah. They call me
ol' plain face.

702
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,564
They call you that?

703
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:36,600
So, do you have any body art
or, like, any ink I could see?

704
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:38,602
That's a pretty random question.

705
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:41,071
Hey, anyway, it was so nice
chatting with you, man.

706
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:42,406
Nice to meet you, man.

707
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:43,440
Yo, what the fuck, bro?

708
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:44,641
Yo, what the fuck
are you doing, dude?

709
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:45,676
You serious
right now?
You...

710
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,044
You're being weird.

711
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:49,379
You've been weird.

712
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,684
It was just like,
what am I hearing?

713
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:54,918
What am I hearing right now?

714
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,919
And the psychic told you that?

715
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,521
Yo.
That is so crazy, dude.

716
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,189
Hey, dude, you want to
go see the roof?

717
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,557
Fuck yeah, I want to
see the roof, dude.

718
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,226
Come on, let's go,
let's go. Come on.

719
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:04,188
Come on to the roof,
come on to the roof.
Let's go.

720
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,493
Come on, you can do it.
Come on, come on, come on!

721
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,472
I miss climbing so much.
Come on, let's go. Come on.

722
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:16,540
All right, uh...

723
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,080
One more time.

724
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,015
I'm just gonna go home.

725
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:26,283
I don't know parkour, so...

726
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,452
All right.

727
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,025
Hey, Maya Angelou!

728
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:39,496
Poetry, okay.
I got it.

729
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:40,658
Make fun of the poetry major.

730
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,533
So, I guess you have no interest

731
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,168
in having a real job
in the future.

732
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,371
Absolutely not.
No, right?

733
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:49,773
What about you?

734
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:52,142
Um, I'm an art major.

735
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:55,245
Okay. So you definitely
cannot talk any shit,
'cause...

736
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,281
No, I can't. I cannot.

737
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:58,181
...you're never gonna
make any money.

738
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,183
I'm never gonna make any money,

739
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,119
so don't tell my parents, but...

740
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,320
When I talk to
your parents tonight,

741
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,155
I will not tell them
about your major.

742
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,757
Okay, thank you.
You're welcome.

743
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,191
All right, art major.

744
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,961
What do you think about that?

745
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,666
Um, I would say that

746
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,070
it's these two beings

747
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:22,940
leaning up
against each other
in perfect balance.

748
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:25,609
If one were to fall,
they would just
lose each other.

749
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,679
So it's just about support.

750
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,483
You can't admit
that it looks
exactly like testicles?

751
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,120
That's exactly
what it looks like.

752
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,893
So, is there someone
who supports you?

753
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:44,394
No, I'm just one of those people

754
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,563
that really likes to
spend time with myself.

755
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,033
Tell me about it.

756
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:53,370
I love to be alone.
I am, like,
the best at it.

757
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:56,373
I just love when you're
sitting there in a room,

758
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,975
and you're just there
with your thoughts,

759
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,043
and you're like,
oh, my gosh, I'm alone.

760
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,845
Would anyone ever
love me? Or whatever.

761
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,614
And, like, do I know
anyone who would care

762
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,717
if I just ever came out
of this room or not?

763
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,352
Or whatever and, like...

764
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:09,519
I don't know.
It's just peaceful.
I just like it.

765
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,154
Yeah.

766
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,090
Well, if you don't want
to be alone tonight,

767
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,852
we are gonna go hang out
at the art building,

768
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,526
if you want to come.

769
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,562
Okay, okay.

770
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,631
Okay. Okay.

771
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,107
I expected tonight
would go in a way that
you wouldn't expect,

772
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,508
but what I didn't expect
was tonight would go

773
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,443
in the exact way
that you would expect.

774
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:36,413
You know what I mean?
Totally.

775
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:38,248
So you guys hang out here a lot?

776
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,717
Yeah. I mean,
we're not into the whole
frat party kind of stuff.

777
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,452
We like to sit around,
just drink some good wine

778
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,454
and talk about
some important stuff.

779
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:48,558
Banging bitches
and getting wasted
all fucking day.

780
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,660
Those are, like, two of
my favorite things to do.

781
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:53,296
You are, like,
a slightly less
attractive version of...

782
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:54,464
Picasso?
Picasso.

783
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:55,532
Right? I've been
told that before.

784
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:56,534
You read my mind.

785
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,102
What?

786
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:20,257
Oh, that's
Cynthia Watson's room.

787
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,526
Oh.

788
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:26,063
It's only 2:00.
I thought it was late.
Do you want to come in?

789
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:29,332
It's only 2:00?
I usually go to dinner at,
like, 2:00 A.M., so...

790
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,834
Sure, yeah, why not?

791
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,765
I'm gonna do it.
I just got to get it
at the right angle.

792
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:40,277
- Dude, stop.
- Stupid fucking goalpost!

793
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:42,712
It's impossible.
You can't fucking do it.

794
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,848
The fans used to rush the field

795
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,483
after every win
and tear down
the goalposts,

796
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:49,052
and coach hated it.
And so he cemented
them in.

797
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:50,454
They storm the field,
and still do it,

798
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:52,222
but they just bounce around.

799
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:53,557
Fuck this goalpost, bro!

800
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,858
You guys might want to hold on,

801
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,427
'cause this shit is coming down.

802
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:04,534
Yo, what is that?
The tattoo, what's that
right there?

803
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,069
Oh. Oh, this?
Mmm-hmm.

804
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:09,706
It's my old high school team.
The plainview red herrings.

805
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,708
Look at it swim.

806
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,678
Shit.
What?

807
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,580
Shit, that's a really
outside-of-the-box

808
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:18,715
high school mascot.

809
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,383
Hold on, guys.

810
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,755
Hey, why don't you
come to practice today?

811
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,957
I mean,
you're obviously good enough
to play on the team.

812
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,760
Look, I'm not
supposed to be here
to play football.

813
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:32,462
What?

814
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,464
I'm just here to
do my assignments

815
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,366
and get out, that's it.

816
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:38,768
I mean, yeah, school's
important or whatever,

817
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,705
but when I was
throwing you those passes,

818
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:44,227
it was like I knew
where you were gonna be
before you went there.

819
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,344
You know, I had this,
like, vision of me

820
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:50,547
throwing bullet tds
to you, dude,

821
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:52,916
and then all these fans
just started going, like...

822
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,319
Zook! Mcquaid!
Zook! Mcquaid!

823
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,355
And they were
chanting and chanting,

824
00:35:58,357 --> 00:36:00,290
and then
the goalposts came down.

825
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,893
Dude?

826
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:05,829
I have had that exact vision,
like, my entire life.

827
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,099
Dude.
Dude.

828
00:36:09,101 --> 00:36:10,800
Bro?
Bro.

829
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,369
Dude.
Bro.

830
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:13,371
Dude.

831
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,506
Like, well, we fucking can, bro.

832
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,828
All you gotta do
is join the team.

833
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:22,846
Yeah. Why not?

834
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,281
Yes!

835
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,449
Fuck yeah, dude.
Fuck yeah, dude.

836
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,485
What's that?

837
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:29,452
My tattoo.

838
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,254
Yeah, fuck, look.

839
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:34,391
Look, it's me, Zook.

840
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:37,294
Got a fucking
bazooka for an arm.
Know what I mean?

841
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,466
Dude, I'm so fucking pumped

842
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,108
you're gonna be on
this fucking team, bro.

843
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:46,904
Yep.

844
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,677
What's up with it?

845
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,845
How you doing?

846
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,214
Hi. Good.

847
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,449
How was the, um...

848
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,719
How was the sex for you?

849
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,955
It was fun for me.
It was a good time.

850
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,290
Yeah, right.

851
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,225
I enjoyed it.

852
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:09,426
Yeah.

853
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:11,695
This is why I don't drink.

854
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:13,496
Oh.

855
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,298
Hey. How you doing?

856
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,334
I'm fine.

857
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,803
I mean, I'm not
listening to you guys
fornicate all night long.

858
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:20,904
Thrusting and pumping.

859
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,606
Okay.

860
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:24,841
I thought your hip
popped out at one point.

861
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,676
I'm just saying, it's,
like, all fun and games,

862
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,959
and then you wake up
in bed next to
a 40-year-old freshman.

863
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,414
I'm 19, so...

864
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,050
Nineteen minutes late
to pinochle,

865
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:35,652
where you're meeting
your old friends
in the park?

866
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:37,420
Yeah, that's what I meant.

867
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,955
Oh, my gosh, Maya, look at him.

868
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:41,324
He's still so sharp.
That's so inspiring.

869
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:44,060
Tell us about the war,
any one of them.

870
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,496
You're, like,
the loudest climaxer
I've ever heard.

871
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,666
It was, like,
the sound of, like,
a 30-year-old sprinkler

872
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:52,068
finally going off
for the first time.

873
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:56,439
Okay, well, so lovely
talking with you.

874
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,907
You're a lovely person.
Hmm.

875
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,810
Nice to meet you.

876
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,812
Oh, my God.

877
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:04,514
She seems nice.

878
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:05,949
She's horrible.

879
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,318
God.

880
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,020
She was Cynthia's roommate,

881
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:11,454
and I felt bad for her,
so I told her I would
room with her.

882
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,056
So...

883
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,394
So you probably
have a bunch of stuff

884
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:18,436
that you have to do today.

885
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,297
Right?
No.

886
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,532
Oh. Okay.

887
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:23,933
Look, I just want you to know

888
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:27,470
I'm not, like,
a hit it and quit it
type of fella.

889
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,105
I'm, like, a hit it,

890
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:33,176
continue to hit it both
physically and emotionally
kind of guy, so...

891
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:35,418
Hey, Doug, you're not gonna be
weird about this, are you?

892
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,447
No.

893
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:38,815
I mean, you're cool
with just hooking up?

894
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,818
Yeah. I mean, no.
I mean, I'm glad
you said something.

895
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,253
'Cause I don't even know
if I like you when I'm sober.

896
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:44,521
No, I know, and it's like,

897
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:46,256
that doesn't even hurt,
like, at all.

898
00:38:46,258 --> 00:38:48,992
Okay, so, um...

899
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,494
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna split.
I'll text you later.

900
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,999
Great, that was great sex.
You're good at it.

901
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,400
And I'll text you,
three to five minutes
or something?

902
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:58,402
All right.

903
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,723
What the fuck is this?

904
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,226
This is bullshit.

905
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,362
Are you two
fucking around
at school again?

906
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:26,830
Hey, we got to
pay for this shit.

907
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:28,631
We need results!
No, no, no.

908
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:31,234
Look, we are
looking aggressively

909
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:33,103
for this very specific tattoo.

910
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:34,704
Or the tattoo could
just be a dead end.

911
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,774
What the fuck?
It's the same case!

912
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,510
Do the same thing.

913
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,979
Well, it's not exactly
the same case, 'cause

914
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,382
one of us got laid last night.

915
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,016
Schmidt?

916
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,284
Shh.

917
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,186
Don't wake up my dick.

918
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:51,988
Flew in on the red-eye,
hasn't gotten
a wink of sleep.

919
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,289
Damn.

920
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,791
We're talking missionary.

921
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:57,327
We're talking missionary.

922
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:00,397
We're talking
when I'm on top
and she's on her back.

923
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,200
She's smart, she's an art major.

924
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:06,836
She can't be that smart.
She's a fucking art major.

925
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,304
Come on.

926
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:09,839
I will give you
some daps, Schmidt.

927
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:10,840
Give me some
motherfucking daps, man!

928
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,075
Come on, give me some.

929
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:13,910
Give me some.
Come on!

930
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,813
My human sexuality class
is blowing my mind.

931
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:18,581
Did you know
I used gay slurs
in high school?

932
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,683
Yes, directed at me.

933
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:24,020
Dude, I am so sorry
for being a homophone.

934
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:26,356
Are we gonna talk about
how weird you were
today with Dickson?

935
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:29,192
Look, I don't think
the tattoo means
what you think it means.

936
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:31,428
I mean, for all we know,
a lot of people
could have that tattoo.

937
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,931
This tattoo?
This absurdly
specific tattoo?

938
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,293
Name one other person
who has this.

939
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,602
For starters, Zook has it.

940
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,037
Zook has the tattoo?

941
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:46,242
What the fuck?
We've been looking for
this tattoo for days!

942
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,977
Do you understand
this means Zook
is the dealer?

943
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:49,646
I really want
you guys to hang out.

944
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:52,782
We have hung out.
He's completely
ignored me.

945
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,585
I'm sorry,
but we're gonna have to
investigate your new bff.

946
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:57,153
We're gonna put
cameras everywhere,

947
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,888
and we're gonna monitor
the fuck out of
what he's doing.

948
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,223
We can't just walk
into zeta house

949
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:02,525
and just put up a bunch of
fucking cameras, okay?

950
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,260
There's dudes there everywhere.

951
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,029
All right, your plan
is stupid. I'm sorry.

952
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:08,498
My plan is stupid?
That's interesting.
What... okay.

953
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,833
I'm, like, basically done

954
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:11,434
fucking watching your shit
all the fucking time.

955
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:12,702
Okay, yeah, exactly.
I'm the fucking
stupid one. Yeah.

956
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,037
Oh, that's really
fucking stupid.

957
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,206
Man, it must be hard
being so different.

958
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:19,442
We're exactly the same.
It makes everything
so much easier.

959
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,945
Guys, can you just
give us some space?

960
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:23,046
We're really trying to
figure something out,

961
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:24,280
and we need to focus, okay?

962
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:26,316
You're not gonna have
trouble focusing, man.

963
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:29,452
Yeah, man,
those krispie treats
got mad whyphy in them.

964
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:31,821
We made a batch
for the whole dorm, man.

965
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,659
I've eaten six of these.

966
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,695
Then you're gonna
be real focused.
Be real focused.

967
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:40,497
In about four hours,
you're gonna be tripping.

968
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,166
You're fine.
You're gonna be
all right, man.

969
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,567
Who sold you whyphy?

970
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:46,069
Nobody sold it to us.

971
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:47,937
Yeah, man, Cynthia
gave us a butt load,

972
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,306
and in exchange,
we wrote her
logic paper for her.

973
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:51,508
All right.
All right, man,
we'll see you guys later.

974
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,076
Enjoy the food.

975
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,677
Maybe this is a good thing.

976
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:59,148
Let's use that focus
to figure out a way to
get into zook's house.

977
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,150
You feel anything?
No. Do you feel anything?

978
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,872
No, but I have a super
high tolerance for...

979
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,759
I'm so focused.

980
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:10,860
I'm so focused, too.

981
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:15,431
You don't have to
be on top of me.

982
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:16,733
Yes, I do.

983
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:18,167
Why?
Camouflage.

984
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:19,302
Go.

985
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:25,675
Let's go.

986
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,678
No fucking way.

987
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,014
Okay, so no?
Dane? All right.

988
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,049
Out, all right.

989
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:40,757
Bull's-eye.
Bingo.

990
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:46,563
That helmet looks kind of lame.

991
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:48,431
You know what's not lame?

992
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:49,433
Safety.

993
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:13,723
What are you doing?

994
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:15,658
I'm cutting glass.

995
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,026
It's a laser pointer.

996
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:18,695
It can't cut glass.
What?

997
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,801
That's no fun at all.

998
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:26,269
I'm so focused.
Let's do this.

999
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:27,431
I'm so focused.
Let's do this.

1000
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,350
Give me another.
I don't have
any more cameras.

1001
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,877
You don't need to
drill so many holes.
Yeah, okay.

1002
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,934
Yeah, that one's perfect.
Okay, you can do that one.

1003
00:43:57,936 --> 00:44:00,056
I don't have
any more cameras.
I've said it five times.

1004
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,374
All right. Okay.
That's the last of 'em.

1005
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:06,976
Time to prove that
zook's the dealer.

1006
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,077
Or not the dealer.

1007
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,913
<i>Next up is Brad mcquaid.</i>

1008
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:12,515
Right? Yes.

1009
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:13,950
Yes!

1010
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:15,952
Obviously, right?
I mean, the guy's...

1011
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:18,087
The guy's all-time.
You guys, let's be honest.

1012
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:20,590
I mean, like, he was
opening up beer cans
with his eyeballs.

1013
00:44:20,592 --> 00:44:21,624
That's so sweet of them.

1014
00:44:21,626 --> 00:44:23,493
<i>So Brad... Brad's in.</i>

1015
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:24,694
Uh, Doug mcquaid.
No!

1016
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,863
He's a bag of dicks!

1017
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,034
He's Brad's brother.

1018
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:33,069
<i>He follows him
around everywhere,</i>

1019
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:35,571
<i>so I doubt we get
Brad without Doug.</i>

1020
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:37,273
That's not true.
I have a serious
girlfriend.

1021
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:39,108
<i>I got a bad feeling</i>
<i>about this guy, dude.</i>
<i>Why? Why?</i>

1022
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,010
<i>I was talking to him
for a second.</i>

1023
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,712
<i>He's got a big mouth, okay?</i>

1024
00:44:42,714 --> 00:44:44,881
<i>I feel like he could fuck
this whole thing up for us.</i>

1025
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:47,350
See, you're fucking this up.
You talk way too much.

1026
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,686
That guy is harmless, dude.
Look at him, he's nice.

1027
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:51,921
He looks like
a 30-year-old
eighth grader.

1028
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:53,122
He's gonna be fine.

1029
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:55,291
I'm just saying, the kid sucks.

1030
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:58,261
Okay, and Brad.
Brad could be,
like, our guy.

1031
00:44:58,263 --> 00:45:01,064
He could, like,
be a part of our thing.

1032
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:02,799
Our thing?
Yeah.

1033
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:04,500
Shh. I'm trying to hear
them be nice about me.

1034
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:05,902
This is fucking
bullshit. Shit!

1035
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,706
Shit.

1036
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,207
Is somebody up there?

1037
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,642
Shit.
We got to
get out of here.

1038
00:45:12,644 --> 00:45:13,810
Did you lock the door?

1039
00:45:13,812 --> 00:45:14,944
I did, man.
I checked twice.

1040
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,329
Go, go!

1041
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,298
I'm so focused, dude.

1042
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:39,769
Shit.

1043
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:47,710
No, you're just paranoid
because we're about
to trip balls.

1044
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:49,078
No, I'm paranoid
because it could
be dangerous.

1045
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,012
No, we're fine.
Look, we made it.

1046
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:51,014
We made it.
It's all good.

1047
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,616
Oh, shit!

1048
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,920
Help! Help!

1049
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,055
What's happening!

1050
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:00,189
What the fuck?

1051
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,429
I can't breathe.

1052
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,499
They made us!

1053
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,167
They're gonna kill us!

1054
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,837
Jenko!

1055
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:16,372
Where are you going?

1056
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:24,080
Oh, fuck!
I'm having a bad trip!
We're having a bad trip!

1057
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:26,015
I think we are tripping, but...

1058
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,483
God, isn't this great?

1059
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:29,385
My side's so much
scarier than yours.

1060
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:31,554
Oh, shit, your trip sucks.

1061
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:33,189
You should come over here.
It's way better.

1062
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:34,290
Okay.

1063
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:39,462
It's some kind of
weird split screen!

1064
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,398
Hello, football.

1065
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,935
Jenko! Jenko!

1066
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,804
I finally got my lambo!

1067
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,506
Hey, Schmidt, look!

1068
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:51,541
Look! Look!

1069
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,520
My legs are tired.

1070
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:09,992
Help! No more music!

1071
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,228
You'll always be alone.

1072
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:14,797
Hey, jenko.
What?

1073
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:16,365
Where are you going?

1074
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:17,466
I'm just gonna go up
for a little while, okay?

1075
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:18,768
Stay, stay here.

1076
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,570
No, I don't want to
stay here. I'm flying.
This is amazing.

1077
00:47:20,572 --> 00:47:22,305
No. God. Don't go!

1078
00:47:22,307 --> 00:47:23,372
Oh, my God.

1079
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:24,640
No!

1080
00:47:24,642 --> 00:47:26,609
Stay here!
No, no, stop it.

1081
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:29,245
You're dragging me down!
Why would you drag me down?

1082
00:47:29,247 --> 00:47:30,247
Please stay!
I'm flying.

1083
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,648
Stay!

1084
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,687
Wake up!
Get out of the car!
Shit.

1085
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:39,555
Get out of the car!
Get on the ground!

1086
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:40,756
On your fucking knees!

1087
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:42,291
Get on your knees!

1088
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:44,327
You already know,
don't you?
What?

1089
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:45,161
Do you have anything to say?

1090
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:46,796
Please don't kill us.

1091
00:47:46,798 --> 00:47:48,831
If you don't have
anything to fucking say,

1092
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,933
open your fucking mouth.

1093
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:57,740
What the fuck?

1094
00:47:57,742 --> 00:47:59,175
Is that vodka?

1095
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:01,811
Welcome to zeta, pledges!

1096
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:03,346
Yeah, buddy!

1097
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:11,087
Pledges, tonight,
we separate the weak
from the strong.

1098
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,658
If you don't make it
through tonight,

1099
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,393
you're dead to all of us.

1100
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,228
Rooster,

1101
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:21,297
light the torch!

1102
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,633
For zeta!

1103
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,607
Drink, motherfucker!
Drink, motherfucker!

1104
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:33,643
Drink, motherfucker!
Drink, motherfucker!

1105
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,817
Look,
whatever happens tonight,
you have to keep up, okay?

1106
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:43,219
I'm gonna throw up.

1107
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:44,487
I know. Shut up. Go.

1108
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:46,923
Ready? Go!

1109
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:49,125
Here we go, here we go.

1110
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:51,427
One, two, three, four, five...

1111
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,829
I can't do it anymore!
I can't do it anymore!

1112
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:55,031
Twenty's the record!

1113
00:48:55,033 --> 00:48:57,099
Thirty-three, 34...

1114
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:58,868
...67...

1115
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,206
You can do this,
you can do this.

1116
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,307
I can't.
This is disgusting.

1117
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,475
No, you got to.
I can't do this anymore!

1118
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,544
And now, for my favorite event.

1119
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,046
Fuck this.
I'm not doing this.

1120
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:45,181
I'm not doing it.
What are... no!

1121
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:47,216
I'm not doing this,
okay? All right?

1122
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,289
Hey!

1123
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:55,091
Schmidt!
What the fuck, man?

1124
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:57,493
What is your problem?
You said you wanted
to stick together.

1125
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:00,262
This is what we have to do
to win their trust.

1126
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:02,765
This is supposed to be fun.
It's just drinking
and bonding games.

1127
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:04,367
It's fun.

1128
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:05,849
It's fun for you.
It's not fun for me.

1129
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:09,338
I don't know.
Maybe we should just...

1130
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:14,010
Maybe we should
just investigate
different people.

1131
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:18,447
Did you really just say that?

1132
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,383
Did you really just say
that you want to
investigate other people?

1133
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:21,751
That's what you want?

1134
00:50:21,753 --> 00:50:23,652
I don't know, maybe.

1135
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:26,355
Maybe we should just...
We should just branch out.

1136
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,224
Okay, just sow
our oats a little.

1137
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,393
Sow our cop oats.

1138
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:32,061
Look, I have an in with Zook.

1139
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,996
We have a thing
and it's good, and...

1140
00:50:33,998 --> 00:50:36,399
I don't know,
maybe I should just
stay closer to him.

1141
00:50:36,401 --> 00:50:38,300
And you should do your thing

1142
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:40,603
with your connections
and channels

1143
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:42,938
with Cynthia's roommate.

1144
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,074
You should see if she knows
who sold her drugs.

1145
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,510
I just...
I just don't...

1146
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:52,448
I don't like the idea
of us doing stuff separately.

1147
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:54,517
No, look, we can
still investigate

1148
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:57,219
together.

1149
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:00,656
It's just, you know,
now it'll be an open thing.

1150
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,893
You want an open investigation?

1151
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:06,328
I don't know if
that's what I want.

1152
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:09,498
All right? I just think
it's healthy right now
for us to try it.

1153
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:13,269
Okay.

1154
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:17,039
Yeah?
Sure.

1155
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:18,921
Okay, so I guess
I'll just catch
you later, then.

1156
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,481
You okay?

1157
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:27,450
No, you can't hug me right now.

1158
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:29,051
Do you need money
for a cab or anything?

1159
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:31,587
No, I don't need money
for a cab.

1160
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,589
Okay.

1161
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,201
I don't know where
the fuck I am right now.

1162
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,507
Hey, Lauren.

1163
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:56,846
I just want to get in bed
and watch <i> friends</i> all day.

1164
00:51:56,848 --> 00:52:00,850
<i>Let's hear it</i>
<i>for your metropolitan</i>
<i>city state statesmen!</i>

1165
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:04,253
<i>And the statesmen take the field</i>

1166
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:07,323
<i>for the opening game</i>
<i>against the university</i>
<i>of college generals.</i>

1167
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:09,058
Ready?

1168
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,493
<i>And a surprise start today</i>

1169
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:12,761
<i>for walk-on freshman
Brad mcquaid.</i>

1170
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:14,163
<i>Looks pretty old
to be a freshman.</i>

1171
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:15,064
<i>It's the hormones
in the milk, Bob.</i>

1172
00:52:15,066 --> 00:52:16,565
Ready? Set, hut!

1173
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:19,635
<i>Haythe drops back.</i>

1174
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:22,278
<i>And connects with mcquaid!</i>

1175
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:27,877
<i>Who beats safety</i>
<i>will glock like an egg white</i>
<i>in my famous meringue recipe.</i>

1176
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,414
Holy shit, he's good.

1177
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:35,651
None of you tell mcquaid
that he's good, all right?

1178
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:38,821
If you do, he'll leave
this shitty program.

1179
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:41,724
<i>And as the clock</i>
<i>ticks down, we've got time</i>
<i>for one last play.</i>

1180
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:49,098
<i>Another perfect hookup
between haythe and mcquaid.</i>

1181
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,367
<i>Even their</i>
<i>end zone celebration</i>
<i>is in perfect sync.</i>

1182
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,769
<i>It's like these two
share a single brain, Bob.</i>

1183
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:56,305
<i>That's right, Jim.</i>
<i>They both have</i>
<i>one half a brain.</i>

1184
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:57,706
<i>And the crowd rushes the field</i>

1185
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,375
<i>to try and knock down
a goalpost.</i>

1186
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:00,509
It's not coming down!

1187
00:53:03,114 --> 00:53:04,446
<i>Good luck, guys.</i>

1188
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:06,715
<i>Looks like mc state's
got a new power couple.</i>

1189
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:08,184
<i>Zook and mcquaid!</i>

1190
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,454
I got to get around you, man.

1191
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:14,857
I can't jump up.
I got a broken ankle.

1192
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:20,930
<i>Yeah!</i>

1193
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,466
<i>Fuck yes!</i>

1194
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:25,968
<i>Yeah!
One more!</i>

1195
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:29,104
Shit.

1196
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:32,641
Who is that?

1197
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:33,643
Nothing.
All right, ready?

1198
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:36,245
<i>Come on!</i>

1199
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:37,479
<i>Focus!</i>

1200
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,724
<i>Come on!
Do it!</i>

1201
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,226
<i>Fuck you, Arnold Schwarzenegger!</i>

1202
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:51,794
<i>I'm so jammed!
Fuck you!</i>

1203
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:53,729
There's a sock on the door!
Don't come in!

1204
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,164
<i>Fuck, yeah!</i>

1205
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:56,665
I'm having sex
with a human woman.

1206
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:58,267
<i>My God! Fuck!</i>

1207
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:04,807
Hey!
Look at you!

1208
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:05,975
What are you guys doing here?

1209
00:54:05,977 --> 00:54:07,977
What? Are you kidding?
It's parents weekend.

1210
00:54:07,979 --> 00:54:09,545
Fuck.

1211
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:12,014
Wonderful.
You're dating someone.

1212
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:15,050
Thanks, mom. Listen,
we're undercover, okay?

1213
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:16,052
Thank you.
No problem.

1214
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:17,987
Doug!

1215
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,755
Maya!

1216
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:20,757
Hey.
Hi.

1217
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:22,625
These are my parents.

1218
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:24,593
So this is the girl?

1219
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,729
Hi. I'm Annie. I'm your
new mother-in-law.

1220
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:30,099
Nice to meet you.
Worst thing to say.

1221
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:31,400
Hi.
Hey. David.

1222
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:32,402
My dad.
Nice to meet you.

1223
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,536
Well, my parents are here, too.

1224
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:36,739
Maya, hurry up!

1225
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:39,008
Your mama done
found a table she want.

1226
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:47,750
How do you know this person?

1227
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:50,352
Dad, this is Doug,
a guy that I'm dating.

1228
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:52,588
The fuck?
I...

1229
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,723
How's your classes going, Doug?

1230
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:57,459
You... we were just in
the neighborhood, and...

1231
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:58,560
I have an idea.
Why don't we all
sit together?

1232
00:54:58,562 --> 00:54:59,895
Would that be fun?

1233
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:01,063
Yes, thank you.

1234
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,279
So...

1235
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:18,847
Do you like weather?

1236
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,217
You two know each other?

1237
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:23,686
No.

1238
00:55:23,688 --> 00:55:25,521
This is crazy, all these, uh,

1239
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,791
students and parents.

1240
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,093
Potential witnesses.

1241
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:33,595
How did you two meet?

1242
00:55:33,597 --> 00:55:35,698
Oh, I love
meet-cute stories.

1243
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,666
We met at a poetry slam,

1244
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,868
and then he stalked me
back to my dorm room.

1245
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,004
Stalked her?
Oh, that's so beautiful.

1246
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:43,305
Then what happened?

1247
00:55:43,307 --> 00:55:45,407
And then we hung out
and we watched a movie.

1248
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:49,011
Actually,
we watched it
a couple times.

1249
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,548
This is bullshit!

1250
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,283
This fucking... waiter!

1251
00:55:54,285 --> 00:55:56,885
What can a black man do
to get some water
around here?

1252
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:58,487
Give the fucking guy some water!

1253
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:00,489
He's black!
He's been through a lot!

1254
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:03,459
For the sake
of your daughter,
please keep it together.

1255
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:05,581
I'm gonna need
a motherfucking crepe
before I go crazy.

1256
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,530
I'll be right back.

1257
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:11,633
So, where are you
from originally?

1258
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:12,768
I'm straight outta Compton,

1259
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,338
but my husband's
from northridge.

1260
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,073
Come on, man, hook me up.

1261
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,378
What the fuck y'all doing?
Y'all rationing around here?

1262
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,213
Come on, hook me up.
Two little fucking
string beans?

1263
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:26,582
Give me the goddamn
string beans.

1264
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:28,450
I want some
fucking deviled eggs.

1265
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:29,818
I like fruit.
Don't you like fruit?

1266
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:31,820
I like fruit.

1267
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:33,989
But this pork shit?
Got to go!

1268
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:35,424
He's really taking it out
on the omelet bar.

1269
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:36,859
Shit was nasty!

1270
00:56:36,861 --> 00:56:38,594
He's under a lot
of pressure at work.

1271
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:40,429
What's up, playa?
Want to go
to the movies?

1272
00:56:40,431 --> 00:56:43,332
I'll break your
motherfucking legs!
Break your legs!

1273
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:46,335
What?

1274
00:56:46,337 --> 00:56:48,737
How you doing, Mr. nice plant?
Get your fucking ass in there.

1275
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:58,080
Hey, you want another beer?
I'm gonna get another beer.

1276
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,882
Yeah, yeah, I'll do another.

1277
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,133
Hey, look, man,

1278
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:19,668
you know you can
always tell me something

1279
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,036
if you want to get
it off your chest.

1280
00:57:21,038 --> 00:57:22,598
You know I'm always
here for you, right?

1281
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:25,374
What are you trying to say?

1282
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:26,475
No, nothing.

1283
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,347
All right, with everything
that happened

1284
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:33,649
with Cynthia and whyphy,

1285
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:36,838
I just don't want you
to screw up.

1286
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:40,322
You don't think I know
what I'm doing?

1287
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:42,057
What?
I know exactly
what I'm doing here.

1288
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,328
I'm gonna tell you
something, all right?

1289
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,796
Can I trust you?
Yeah, of course.

1290
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:56,638
I have a friend who
knows a guy at umc.

1291
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,374
He's a scout. It's d-I.

1292
00:57:59,376 --> 00:58:01,043
Their qb, he's not playing well.

1293
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:02,044
They're not happy
with the situation.

1294
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:03,412
They want me to make a tape.

1295
00:58:03,414 --> 00:58:05,747
And I want you to
be on it with me.

1296
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,687
Nothing else?

1297
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:13,555
They had five guys in
the draft last year.

1298
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:14,823
I mean, Brad,
this could be our shot.

1299
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,859
We're like the dynamic duo, bro.

1300
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:19,294
We're like Batman and Robin.

1301
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:21,196
But we're both Batman.

1302
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:23,365
What do you want to be,
like, a stockbroker?

1303
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:24,900
Or a cop?

1304
00:58:24,902 --> 00:58:26,768
Dude, your ceiling is, like,

1305
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:29,171
so high.

1306
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,009
You can just bust right...

1307
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:36,144
Just break
right through it.
Right through it.

1308
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:38,914
Right through it.
Right through it.

1309
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:40,883
You really think
I could make it at umc?

1310
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:44,219
Dude, you could make it
into the hall of fame.

1311
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:46,121
No, dude, come on, that's you.

1312
00:58:46,123 --> 00:58:48,590
You're gonna be in,
like, the anals of
football history.

1313
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:51,159
Dude, you could make it
into the anals of
football history, too.

1314
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,697
We're gonna have to
tear those anals up.

1315
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,266
All right.
We're gonna
fucking tear it up.

1316
00:58:57,268 --> 00:58:58,548
I mean, it's just a tape, right?

1317
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,769
I fucking hate my dad so much.

1318
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:02,170
Do you have any idea

1319
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:03,405
what it's like to
have a guy like that

1320
00:59:03,407 --> 00:59:05,140
telling you what
to do all the time?

1321
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:06,575
I can only imagine.

1322
00:59:06,577 --> 00:59:09,978
I just don't understand
what his problem is
with you specifically.

1323
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,814
I don't... Jesus.
That makes no sense to me.

1324
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:13,916
I mean, you are
a perfectly good guy.

1325
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:15,017
You're very honest and nice.

1326
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:17,619
Why does my dad
have your phone number?

1327
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:20,188
I don't know.
Maybe the school
directory or something.

1328
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,557
Let's do something...

1329
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:22,424
Let's do something
that would distract us.

1330
00:59:22,426 --> 00:59:24,059
Okay.

1331
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:26,128
So we don't have to think
about him anymore.

1332
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,729
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

1333
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:28,971
All right. Um...

1334
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:30,599
Maya.

1335
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,002
Is it okay if we just talk?

1336
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:37,205
Okay.

1337
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:39,508
Let's talk.

1338
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,276
No way.
Yeah.

1339
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:43,278
I was Peter Pan,
but then I was,
like, late.

1340
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,000
You're really close
with your brother, then.

1341
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:47,049
It seems like.
Yeah.

1342
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,284
Yeah, you know...

1343
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:54,823
You're a fucking genius, dude.

1344
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:56,465
Are you sure it's
not too much, though?
No!

1345
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,595
<i>Yeah!
Fuck, yeah!</i>

1346
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:01,897
All right? All right?
Yeah. Yeah.

1347
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:03,332
All night, bro.
Come on. All night.
Yeah, I know.

1348
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:04,800
It's gonna be so worth it, dude.

1349
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:06,268
It's gonna be
fucking worth it,
I promise, all right?

1350
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:07,736
Dude, you know what this needs?

1351
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:09,504
Another star wipe.

1352
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:11,540
Jinx. Buy me a beer.

1353
01:00:11,542 --> 01:00:12,641
Nice twist.

1354
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:13,742
On what?

1355
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,312
I can't believe we've
been talking all night.

1356
01:00:17,314 --> 01:00:21,316
Oh, my God, it's 8:00.
I have class, actually.

1357
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:23,418
Okay.
I...

1358
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:26,288
Yeah, you can help yourself
to whatever you need, and...

1359
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,623
All right.

1360
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,524
Yeah, I'm so sorry, this...

1361
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:30,993
I'll see you.

1362
01:00:30,995 --> 01:00:32,027
I'll see you later.

1363
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:33,762
Okay.
Best night ever.

1364
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:35,197
Okay. Bye.

1365
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:38,367
Bye.

1366
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:44,806
How long have you been there?

1367
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:47,275
Like, the longest amount
of time you could think of
right now.

1368
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:48,677
This stuff wasn't meant for you.

1369
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:50,245
It was meant to be private.

1370
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:52,781
So, am I supposed
to just sit here
and not act like

1371
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:55,017
I hear every one
of your problems?

1372
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:58,387
You got 99 problems,
but being young isn't one.

1373
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:01,757
You're just jealous
because Maya and I
have a real connection.

1374
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:03,258
I'm pretty close
with my grandpa, too.

1375
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,461
You're more messed up
than Cynthia was,

1376
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:08,697
and she went to
the school shrink
three times a week.

1377
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,866
Why?
I don't know.

1378
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:12,701
But he gave her
a ton of pills
and shit.

1379
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:15,103
Maybe he could
give you something
for your weird old face.

1380
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:16,105
Okay.

1381
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,444
Hey.
You're late.

1382
01:01:22,446 --> 01:01:25,247
No, actually,
I was busy with
the investigation.

1383
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:30,185
This is Cynthia's
therapist's office.
This is our investigation.

1384
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:32,721
All right.

1385
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:42,064
Watch the door.

1386
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:45,300
Oh, is that all I'm good for?
Just watching a fucking door?

1387
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:48,837
Got it.

1388
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,908
Patient exhibits
drug-induced paranoia.

1389
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:55,343
Believes her life is in danger.

1390
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:56,345
Uh, door, door.

1391
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,415
Hey.

1392
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:02,851
I wasn't told that I had
a 9:00 A.M. session.

1393
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:04,720
Yeah, no,
we're your 9:00 A.M.
that's us.

1394
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:07,322
And we're cured.

1395
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:09,958
Thank you very much.
You're an amazing doctor.

1396
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,727
Please. You think
you're the first partners

1397
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:16,565
only to try to run
when you're first faced
with talking with me?

1398
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:17,999
How the fuck did you know
we were partners?

1399
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:19,768
He doesn't know we're partners.

1400
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,503
I suspect you're partners.

1401
01:02:21,505 --> 01:02:24,172
A relationship is something
that requires constant work.

1402
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:25,674
Which is what I thought
we learned in high school.

1403
01:02:25,676 --> 01:02:27,642
So you are
high school sweethearts.

1404
01:02:27,644 --> 01:02:28,844
I picked up on that early.

1405
01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:30,046
Please, continue the dialogue.

1406
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:31,513
Doc.

1407
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:34,516
I just feel like sometimes

1408
01:02:34,518 --> 01:02:36,017
he's not even trying anymore.

1409
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:38,386
Like this isn't
even worth saving.

1410
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:39,721
Oh, okay.
Well, sometimes
I feel like

1411
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:41,356
that we should be
more like the yangs.

1412
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:43,058
Or maybe I should be more
like your beautiful zook.

1413
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,626
Oh, go fuck yourself!
You go fuck yourself.

1414
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:46,628
Okay.
You're so selfish.

1415
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,497
All right.
That's a lot of fucking.
Oh, my God.

1416
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:52,200
Sometimes I like to
have the participants
make physical contact.

1417
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:53,602
Why don't you hold hands?

1418
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:55,003
Okay.
I'm not doing that.

1419
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:56,872
Hmm?
Do you see?

1420
01:02:56,874 --> 01:02:58,039
Reach out your hand.

1421
01:02:58,041 --> 01:02:59,541
I'm...

1422
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:01,343
He's literally
reaching out for you.

1423
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:02,444
He won't hold my hand.

1424
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:03,612
I'm not doing it.

1425
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:05,013
I kind of need you to do it.

1426
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:06,848
He won't hold my hand.
Oh, you...

1427
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,316
You got to interlock it, though.

1428
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:09,684
If you don't interlock it,
it's not hand-holding.

1429
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:11,253
Fine.

1430
01:03:11,255 --> 01:03:12,420
We might as well just be friends

1431
01:03:12,422 --> 01:03:13,455
and not partners.

1432
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:14,457
Nice, right?

1433
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,392
Okay, you see this?
This is strong.

1434
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:19,628
What I want to be
able to have is this.

1435
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,297
Is this...

1436
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:26,101
I want to be
able to have that,
that same thing, in, like

1437
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:28,270
without actually
having to do it.

1438
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:29,471
Are you embarrassed
of your partner?

1439
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:30,906
No, not at all. Okay?

1440
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:32,674
And why the fuck
are you guys
ganging up on me?

1441
01:03:32,676 --> 01:03:33,875
Gang up on him.
Okay, seriously.

1442
01:03:33,877 --> 01:03:35,644
Okay, okay.
He's clingy.

1443
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,913
He literally is terrified
of being by himself.

1444
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:39,514
Look, I know zook's your buddy

1445
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:40,415
and you don't
want him to be guilty,

1446
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:41,883
but he's our guy.

1447
01:03:41,885 --> 01:03:43,819
No, he's actually
not our guy.
I would know.

1448
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:46,354
Now, you know,
we sometimes cling to things

1449
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:48,456
because they're
familiar and comfortable.

1450
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,192
I teach about
a principle called embedding.

1451
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:51,726
Look at the facts.
Matter of fact, I...

1452
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:54,296
Zook has the tattoo.
He knew Cynthia.

1453
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:55,597
I know the first time
he met you,

1454
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:56,898
you dropped a fucking
sandwich on his foot

1455
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,300
and he smiled at you,

1456
01:03:58,302 --> 01:04:01,369
but you are completely
blind to the fact...

1457
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:03,305
What'd you say
embedding was?
Embedding?

1458
01:04:03,307 --> 01:04:06,775
Oh, embedding
is our tendency
to latch on to

1459
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:09,277
the first bit
of information
that we're offered

1460
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:11,913
and overlooking,
or even ignoring,
contradictory information.

1461
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:12,814
It's a fascinating principle...

1462
01:04:12,816 --> 01:04:14,583
Shut up. I'm thinking.

1463
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,953
You think it's possible that

1464
01:04:17,955 --> 01:04:19,788
we embedded?

1465
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:21,423
What, like when we were
drunk or something?

1466
01:04:21,425 --> 01:04:23,325
We embedded
each other?
Okay. I'm gonna recommend...

1467
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:24,092
Okay, you can leave the room.

1468
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:25,160
Just get the fuck out.

1469
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:27,462
Get the fuck out.
You heard him.

1470
01:04:27,464 --> 01:04:28,763
This took a turn.

1471
01:04:28,765 --> 01:04:30,265
One, two...

1472
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:32,033
- Okay. Yep.
- Good session.

1473
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,301
The first time we saw the photo

1474
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:34,669
of Cynthia buying whyphy,

1475
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:37,339
<i>dickson said,
this guy's the dealer.</i>

1476
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:39,407
Everything we've done
and thought has been
based on that fact,

1477
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:41,109
but what if dickson was wrong?

1478
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:43,545
And we've ignored
all the other clues.

1479
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:45,267
<i>What if Cynthia
wasn't the buyer?</i>

1480
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:47,849
<i>What if Cynthia was the dealer?</i>

1481
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:51,286
Captain, we have something
really, really important
to tell you about.

1482
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,058
Captain?

1483
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,793
Are you wearing kevlar?

1484
01:04:58,795 --> 01:05:03,331
Now, gentlemen,
we're not gonna
sit here and pretend

1485
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:05,834
there's not a big-ass
elephant in the room.

1486
01:05:05,836 --> 01:05:06,876
What the fuck is going on?

1487
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:09,938
This is what
the fuck is going on.

1488
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,947
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1489
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,185
Oh, shit! No!

1490
01:05:24,187 --> 01:05:27,756
That is not happening
right now! No!

1491
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:31,159
Hey, y'all, he's fucking
the captain's daughter! Yo!

1492
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:32,661
Every time he say that shit...

1493
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:34,229
Oh, my fuck!

1494
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:36,231
...that's another
foot in your ass.

1495
01:05:36,233 --> 01:05:39,467
Schmidt, you clearly...
Yo, this is
the best thing ever!

1496
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:44,239
Schmidt fucked
the captain's daughter!

1497
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:47,242
Schmidt fucked
the captain's daughter!

1498
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:50,078
Schmidt fucked
the captain's daughter!

1499
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,681
Shit! Fuck!

1500
01:05:52,683 --> 01:05:55,283
You fucked
captain dickson's daughter?

1501
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,519
Captain, what the...

1502
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:59,921
You bragged to him to his face.

1503
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:01,589
To his actual face.
Captain...

1504
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:05,393
Do you understand that
this face right here,
you bragged to that face?

1505
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:08,964
You actually
high-fived schmidt
for fucking your daughter.

1506
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:10,031
Holy shit!

1507
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,067
Oh, my God! This is...

1508
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:14,970
It's really not that funny.

1509
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,939
I just want to say that

1510
01:06:17,941 --> 01:06:22,344
it was bizarre not
to share the fact

1511
01:06:22,346 --> 01:06:24,879
that your daughter
went to mc state.

1512
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:26,247
I think it's bizarre

1513
01:06:26,249 --> 01:06:28,616
that I haven't cut your
motherfucking nuts off.

1514
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:31,953
What if captain gets to
punch you in the face
one time,

1515
01:06:31,955 --> 01:06:33,688
really, really, really hard?

1516
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:34,690
Nah.

1517
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:38,259
I got something
way better than that.

1518
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:44,733
You think Cynthia
was the dealer?

1519
01:06:44,735 --> 01:06:47,936
How the fuck we gonna
infiltrate the dealer
if the dealer is dead?

1520
01:06:47,938 --> 01:06:49,371
We have to stop treating this

1521
01:06:49,373 --> 01:06:51,773
like it's exactly
the same as last time.

1522
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,843
And we got a bigger problem.
No more money in the budget.

1523
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:56,325
What? I thought
we had Cate blanchett.

1524
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:58,513
Cate blanchett?

1525
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:01,016
Yeah, I thought we
had Cate blanchett
with the budget.

1526
01:07:01,018 --> 01:07:02,550
You mean carte blanche.

1527
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:04,686
That one.

1528
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,488
Welcome back, dum-dum.

1529
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:09,724
We did have carte blanche.
Not no more.

1530
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:11,893
You got
that expensive chase
in the beginning,

1531
01:07:11,895 --> 01:07:15,663
that expensive equipment,
this fucking office...

1532
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:18,933
This look like some shit
iron man would have.
Shit's expensive!

1533
01:07:18,935 --> 01:07:22,904
I got on $800 shoes,
and you can't even
see the motherfuckers.

1534
01:07:22,906 --> 01:07:25,340
So now you two motherfuckers
is in the crosshairs.

1535
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:26,808
I'm warning you,

1536
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,710
find the supplier,

1537
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:30,392
but don't cost
the department
no more money.

1538
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:36,017
Look, I apologize
about the zook thing.

1539
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:38,353
You were right,
he's not the dealer.

1540
01:07:38,355 --> 01:07:39,821
Okay, great.
You apologized.

1541
01:07:39,823 --> 01:07:41,222
What's that worth, man?

1542
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:44,526
Now we have no leads.
What are we supposed
to do now?

1543
01:07:44,528 --> 01:07:45,528
Police work.

1544
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,436
Fuck.

1545
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:00,308
Don't throw a fucking
dead person's dildo at me.

1546
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:02,477
We're at work right now, okay?

1547
01:08:02,479 --> 01:08:04,746
Kids don't check out
books anymore, right?

1548
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,582
I don't even think
they know how to read.

1549
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:12,187
Library.
Book place.

1550
01:08:12,189 --> 01:08:13,354
Library.

1551
01:08:13,356 --> 01:08:15,423
The supplier is putting drugs

1552
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:16,524
inside the books in the library,

1553
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:18,660
where literally no one
goes anymore, man.

1554
01:08:18,662 --> 01:08:20,428
And the dealers
check out the books.

1555
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,297
We're going to
catch the supplier.

1556
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:23,598
Do you realize
how cool...
Wait, one sec, one sec.

1557
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,100
What's up, dude?

1558
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:27,001
Hey, dude, where are you?

1559
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:29,237
We're warming up.
The game's about to start.

1560
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:30,839
All right, man.
Um, look, I'm just gonna...

1561
01:08:30,841 --> 01:08:32,107
I'm coming.

1562
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:33,341
All right, later.

1563
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:34,943
What are you doing?
Don't leave me hanging.

1564
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:37,645
Dude, I got to go or
I'm gonna blow my cover,
okay?

1565
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:39,114
You can do this alone.
I'll be back in two hours.

1566
01:08:39,116 --> 01:08:40,315
You got this.

1567
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:52,327
You scared me.

1568
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:06,007
State name! Number!
State name! Number!

1569
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:07,609
Color! Color! Number!

1570
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:09,744
This is the place.

1571
01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:11,312
You'd think if somebody
wants to show us
their operation,

1572
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:12,747
they'd at least be on time.

1573
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:16,584
Look at this crap. Huh?

1574
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:18,653
I do miss the days...
Shit.

1575
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,735
What's he doing here?
...When people
did normal drugs.

1576
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:22,590
What is this?
Jelly beans?

1577
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:24,959
Crap!

1578
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:26,995
Set, hut!

1579
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:29,931
<i>Mcquaid crosses
in an end-around.</i>

1580
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:33,234
<i>It's a trick play!</i>
<i>These two are</i>
<i>practically interchangeable.</i>

1581
01:09:33,236 --> 01:09:35,503
<i>Mcquaid throws down
the field to haythe.</i>

1582
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:42,177
<i>And he hangs on
for the touchdown!</i>

1583
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:43,745
<i>These two are
peas in a pod, Bob,</i>

1584
01:09:43,747 --> 01:09:45,147
<i>but instead of
little green balls,</i>

1585
01:09:45,148 --> 01:09:46,648
<i>they are human football players.</i>

1586
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:54,756
<i>Let's hear it</i>
<i>once again, mc state,</i>
<i>for your dynamic duo.</i>

1587
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,561
Oh, shit. My brother
needs me again.

1588
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:04,332
Look, you know, loyalty's cool,

1589
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:06,167
and I admire it,

1590
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:07,335
and I know he's your brother.

1591
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:10,972
But you can't
allow yourself to be
held down by a guy

1592
01:10:10,974 --> 01:10:13,675
just because he won't let go.

1593
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,247
Yeah. Um...

1594
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:23,318
I gotta take a piss.

1595
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,122
The kid's pretty rude
to make us wait like this.

1596
01:10:28,124 --> 01:10:29,791
Can you shut it?

1597
01:10:29,793 --> 01:10:31,993
What's wrong with
those classic drugs
from the '90s?

1598
01:10:31,995 --> 01:10:33,795
Heroin, you know, cocaine...

1599
01:10:33,797 --> 01:10:35,563
Hey, hey.
Whoa. Shit.

1600
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:36,631
I'm fucking here.
You happy?
Shh!

1601
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:38,299
The ghost is right there, okay?

1602
01:10:38,301 --> 01:10:39,767
He's about to meet up
with the supplier.

1603
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:41,703
- Hey. Check that out.
- You shush.

1604
01:10:41,705 --> 01:10:43,404
You're the one
fucking talking.
You're being so fucking loud.

1605
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:44,572
You shut the fuck up.

1606
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:46,708
- What's going on here?
- Shit!

1607
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,243
Um...

1608
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:51,446
You're interrupting
a really stellar blow job.

1609
01:10:51,448 --> 01:10:53,448
Oh, fuck, I just came so hard!

1610
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:54,682
What the hell is going on?

1611
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:56,284
It's okay. It's just
a couple of faggots.

1612
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:58,586
Hey, yo, what the fuck
did you just say?

1613
01:10:58,588 --> 01:10:59,988
Did you just call us faggots?

1614
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:01,310
He said you were
sucking his dick.

1615
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:03,591
It's 2014, asshole.

1616
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,159
You can't fucking use faggot.

1617
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:07,295
Gay is okay.
Homosexual, maybe.

1618
01:11:07,297 --> 01:11:09,797
And if you know the person,
you might be able to
call them a queer.

1619
01:11:09,799 --> 01:11:11,699
If they have a great
sense of humor,
but I don't.

1620
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:13,234
I'm sorry, he took one
human sexuality class,

1621
01:11:13,236 --> 01:11:14,435
he thinks he's Harvey milk.

1622
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,304
Oh, my God.
Will you please,

1623
01:11:16,306 --> 01:11:18,306
just for once, just back me up?

1624
01:11:18,308 --> 01:11:19,907
Why can't you just
use your head for once?

1625
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:21,349
Oh. You want me
to use my head? Fine.

1626
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:24,879
Oh, yeah,
what's up now,
motherfuckers?

1627
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:25,881
You remember me?

1628
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:27,148
I'm your best night...

1629
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:28,516
I'm your worst nightmare.

1630
01:11:28,518 --> 01:11:30,685
Oh, man, it's my memory.

1631
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:32,920
It's getting worse lately.

1632
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:34,656
Are you the police?

1633
01:11:34,658 --> 01:11:37,959
Yeah, that's right.
And you motherfuckers
are all under arrest.

1634
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:40,762
Where's your gun?

1635
01:11:40,764 --> 01:11:41,896
What?
Do you have guns?

1636
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:44,265
No.

1637
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:45,967
No, I don't.

1638
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:48,736
'Cause we have guns.

1639
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:52,840
Well, why don't you
put your guns down,
and let's fight like men?

1640
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:56,678
Because we have guns.

1641
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,513
Schmidt, run!
Get him!

1642
01:11:58,515 --> 01:12:00,715
Go! Go, go.
Go!

1643
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:01,717
Shit!

1644
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:04,185
How hard
can it be? Shoot them!

1645
01:12:04,187 --> 01:12:05,420
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1646
01:12:05,422 --> 01:12:06,422
Shoot them! Shoot them!

1647
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,557
Come on, this way, it's faster.

1648
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:11,079
No, just come this...
Schmidt! Schmidt!

1649
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,095
Hurry up, okay?

1650
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:19,901
Schmidt, will you hurry up!

1651
01:12:19,903 --> 01:12:21,543
Stop yelling at me!
You're distracting me!

1652
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,640
Schmidt, come on!
Let's go!

1653
01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:27,475
I can't jump down!
I'm not, like,
fucking spider-man!

1654
01:12:27,477 --> 01:12:29,344
I'm gonna get the car.

1655
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:34,549
Stairs are so much faster.

1656
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,385
That's the car you got?

1657
01:12:37,387 --> 01:12:38,953
I'm sorry it's
not a fucking lambo.
Shut up and get in.

1658
01:12:38,955 --> 01:12:40,054
Are they even still chasing us?

1659
01:12:40,056 --> 01:12:41,256
Yes, they're still chasing us!

1660
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:50,264
Why did you do that?
We were about to
catch the supplier.

1661
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:51,499
What's wrong with you?

1662
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:52,767
Look, if you don't
say something,

1663
01:12:52,769 --> 01:12:54,535
people will never
stop discriminating.

1664
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,137
Will you please do something

1665
01:12:56,139 --> 01:12:57,459
about how slow
this thing's going?

1666
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:02,744
Oh, shit!
Watch out, watch out!

1667
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,683
That is just like
a little helmet machine.

1668
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,962
We can't destroy any more stuff!

1669
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:23,531
We can't waste any more
of the department's money!

1670
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:24,866
Watch out for that cash machine!

1671
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:29,604
Whoo!

1672
01:13:29,606 --> 01:13:30,772
Which way?
Which way? Which way?

1673
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:32,054
Whichever way's cheaper!

1674
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,108
Right? You went right?

1675
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:35,543
You could've gone
in a parking lot,

1676
01:13:35,545 --> 01:13:36,878
you went to
the sculpture garden?

1677
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,520
Do you know how expensive
that's gonna be?

1678
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:44,652
Shit!

1679
01:13:44,654 --> 01:13:45,620
It's like they're
trying to hit 'em
or something.

1680
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:46,954
I mean, it looks cool,

1681
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:48,316
but, I mean,
it's just so wasteful.

1682
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:53,094
They're destroying everything!

1683
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:55,329
Captain's gonna kill us!

1684
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:56,898
What are we gonna do?

1685
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,065
All right,
we're gonna lose 'em
in the robotics lab.

1686
01:13:58,067 --> 01:13:59,067
What?

1687
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,074
Oh, no!
Oh, we broke everything!

1688
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:08,843
There was a lot of
expensive stuff in there!

1689
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,279
Oh, shit!

1690
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:13,988
They're going into the stadium!

1691
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:18,605
Listen, schmidt,
I gotta tell you something.

1692
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:20,588
I got offered a scholarship

1693
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:22,356
to play football here next year.

1694
01:14:22,358 --> 01:14:24,392
And zook said I could
room with him, you know,

1695
01:14:24,394 --> 01:14:28,329
so I was thinking that
I could do that, maybe.

1696
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:30,331
What? You can't be a cop

1697
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:32,099
and stay here
and play football
with zook.

1698
01:14:32,101 --> 01:14:34,135
No, look, I know, okay?
It's just...

1699
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:36,270
There's no friction
with me and zook.
We're the same.

1700
01:14:36,272 --> 01:14:38,473
Do you want out?
If you want out, just say it.

1701
01:14:38,475 --> 01:14:40,274
No, I don't want out, okay?

1702
01:14:40,276 --> 01:14:41,943
It's just, when I'm
on the football field

1703
01:14:41,945 --> 01:14:44,479
and I'm diving for a pass,
I feel like I can fly.

1704
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:45,780
All right?
And when I'm with you,

1705
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:47,182
it just feels like
you hold me down.

1706
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:50,551
I just wish you
could fly with me.

1707
01:14:50,553 --> 01:14:53,521
<i>And the statesmen
win, 34-14.</i>

1708
01:14:53,523 --> 01:14:55,423
<i>And there go
the fans onto the field.</i>

1709
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,498
Jenko!

1710
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:05,700
Jesus Christ!

1711
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,337
Dude, the brakes
are out.
What?

1712
01:15:09,339 --> 01:15:10,872
Get the fuck out of the way!

1713
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:12,514
You gotta jump.
You gotta jump,
jump, jump!

1714
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:19,247
No.

1715
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,824
Fuck!

1716
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:43,237
Let's go, boss.
We gotta go.

1717
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:47,108
You did it! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

1718
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:51,078
You're under arrest, sir.

1719
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,713
Hey, I'm an officer, all right?

1720
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:55,149
Just take me in.
I'll explain later.

1721
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:57,218
No, no, no.
Hey, he's a student.
He didn't do anything.

1722
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:00,187
Wait, wait.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1723
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:01,189
I, um...

1724
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,324
I decided for you.

1725
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:08,129
Just stick with football.

1726
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:11,365
I can't give you
the same feeling
that these guys can.

1727
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:12,400
Maybe we were
only supposed
to do this once.

1728
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:13,968
What?

1729
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:14,936
Dude, this is
the fucking best
moment of my life!

1730
01:16:14,938 --> 01:16:16,270
Let's go, man!

1731
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:22,910
Mcquaid! Mcquaid! Mcquaid!

1732
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,226
Hey, Maya angelou.

1733
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,629
Thanks for lying to me.

1734
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,270
Aw.

1735
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:56,210
Lam-bros! Yes!

1736
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:58,546
Brad mcquaid!
Brad mcquaid!

1737
01:16:58,548 --> 01:16:59,947
Brad mcquaid! Brad...

1738
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:09,056
How are we doing
tonight, sir?
Good, thanks.

1739
01:17:09,058 --> 01:17:10,992
Are we waiting
on anybody or
you dining alone?

1740
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:13,027
Someone may swing by,
but we can...

1741
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:14,795
We can order without them.

1742
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:19,100
<i>We have identified</i>
<i>and arrested one</i>
<i>Dr. Karl Murphy,</i>

1743
01:17:19,102 --> 01:17:22,436
<i>who was found with</i>
<i>whyphy residue</i>
<i>throughout his office...</i>

1744
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:26,007
<i>...and had a close</i>
<i>personal relationship</i>
<i>with the deceased.</i>

1745
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:28,709
<i>Exactly like a case</i>
<i>we had recently at</i>
<i>a high school.</i>

1746
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:31,746
<i>Exactly the same.</i>

1747
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:34,949
<i>The case is closed.</i>

1748
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:37,351
You know, like, what
you're gonna do after
you're out of here?

1749
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:43,791
You're not supposed
to throw rocks.

1750
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:46,527
What?

1751
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:49,030
You're not supposed
to throw rocks.

1752
01:17:58,241 --> 01:18:01,008
The lobster for one person.

1753
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,144
Enough for one person only.

1754
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,649
I found something in
this whyphy case that
caught my attention.

1755
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:10,351
Get the fuck out of my office.

1756
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:11,819
Sir, you don't...
We caught the guy.

1757
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:15,289
Yeah! Yeah!

1758
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:23,130
Hey, you want to do
anything else other than
work out today?

1759
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:24,365
Like what?

1760
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:26,000
Come on, dude.
They're just
lobsters, dude.

1761
01:18:26,002 --> 01:18:27,468
Come on.
No, don't be afraid.

1762
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:29,550
It's gonna claw your face.
It's gonna claw your face.

1763
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:39,880
It's gonna be like
this, dude, for the
rest of our lives.

1764
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:07,875
Hey.
Hey.

1765
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:12,513
What are you doing here?

1766
01:19:12,515 --> 01:19:14,482
Just came to see how you are.

1767
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:17,585
I'm doing fucking great.

1768
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:19,086
I'm the happiest I've ever been,

1769
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:21,655
so I'm just having
a great time with myself.

1770
01:19:21,657 --> 01:19:23,457
I'm glad you're
having a good time
with yourself.

1771
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:26,761
I'm a solo artist now,
like Beyonce.

1772
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:30,498
I used to have the
other destiny's children,
but now I'm just, uh,

1773
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,699
a lone superstar.

1774
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:33,434
Happy for you.

1775
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:36,337
Just a light-skinned
princess with a dream
and an amazing voice.

1776
01:19:36,339 --> 01:19:37,339
That's great.

1777
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,140
How are you?

1778
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:42,209
I'm pretty great.

1779
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:44,912
I just chill and...
You know how
chill zook is.

1780
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:45,980
Zook's such a chill guy.

1781
01:19:45,982 --> 01:19:47,648
Just like ice.

1782
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:49,483
That makes me so happy for you.

1783
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:54,855
So, look, I just
wanted to say that, like,

1784
01:19:54,857 --> 01:19:56,924
I was thinking about the case,

1785
01:19:56,926 --> 01:19:59,193
and I was worried
that they got
the wrong guy for it.

1786
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:01,729
I don't think
he's the guy, either.

1787
01:20:01,731 --> 01:20:03,330
Yeah?

1788
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:05,399
I looked into
the ghost's background,

1789
01:20:05,401 --> 01:20:08,469
and I saw that
he pays tuition for
a student at mc state.

1790
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:10,204
You think
the ghost could be
the supplier's dad?

1791
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:11,472
Maybe.

1792
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:12,540
Okay, that's
a pretty good piece
of information.

1793
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:13,808
Thank you.

1794
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:16,210
Well, I heard whyphy's
coming back in a big way.

1795
01:20:16,212 --> 01:20:17,711
Someone's bringing
a shit-ton of that stuff

1796
01:20:17,713 --> 01:20:19,547
down to puerto, Mexico,
for spring break.

1797
01:20:19,549 --> 01:20:22,583
And if that happens,
whyphy is going viral.

1798
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:24,051
It's gonna be
at every college
in the country.

1799
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:26,287
I think my information
was stronger.

1800
01:20:26,289 --> 01:20:28,255
Look, if you...
If you want to,

1801
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:30,958
we could go down there.

1802
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,761
Like together?

1803
01:20:33,763 --> 01:20:35,396
We don't have to
put a label on it.

1804
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:37,598
Just, like, one-time.
One-time thing.

1805
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,733
No big commitment or
stress to each other.

1806
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:45,539
What about school
and football and
your wonderful new life?

1807
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:47,842
I have time off.

1808
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:51,212
I'm on spring break.

1809
01:21:05,895 --> 01:21:06,895
Cool tingling.

1810
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:09,430
Got room for one
of these babies.

1811
01:21:09,432 --> 01:21:11,732
A grenade.
Why you gonna
put it there?

1812
01:21:11,734 --> 01:21:13,167
That's just unsanitary.

1813
01:21:13,169 --> 01:21:14,169
Feels right.

1814
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:27,181
Missed a spot.

1815
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:40,627
You know this is just
a one-time thing, right?

1816
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:42,930
I know.

1817
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:46,467
So you're not gonna
be weird about this?

1818
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:51,939
Okay.

1819
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:57,611
Perfect.

1820
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,481
Spring break, motherfucker.

1821
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:05,586
Did you not see that
I was going first?
Excuse you.

1822
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:07,655
Excuse you.
You want to go first?

1823
01:22:07,657 --> 01:22:09,623
<i>Spring break, motherfuckers!</i>

1824
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:29,009
Hey.

1825
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,079
My gosh! I'm sweaty.

1826
01:23:05,081 --> 01:23:06,180
You guys are actually
eating stuff in here?

1827
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:08,315
That's so crazy.

1828
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:09,950
Come on, man,
put your dick away.

1829
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,218
Put your fucking dick away.

1830
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:12,720
Upstairs, upstairs.
Let's go.

1831
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:16,957
<i>Okay, so here's the plan.</i>

1832
01:23:16,959 --> 01:23:21,061
We're gonna get all these
kids at spring break
hooked on whyphy.

1833
01:23:21,063 --> 01:23:23,063
Then you're gonna
bring it back
to your turf,

1834
01:23:23,065 --> 01:23:25,165
and you're gonna sell
the shit out of it.

1835
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:27,901
Sell shit out of it.
Do you see that?

1836
01:23:27,903 --> 01:23:31,705
And if you rat me out,
I framed my psych prof just
for giving me a b-minus.

1837
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:34,208
He's in jail now,
so don't fuck with me.

1838
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:36,744
We're gonna build
a nationwide network.

1839
01:23:36,746 --> 01:23:39,146
What? What the fuck
are you doing?
Be quiet.

1840
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:41,615
Why don't you sell
those old classic drugs

1841
01:23:41,617 --> 01:23:44,685
from the '90s,
like cocaine,
heroin and...

1842
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:47,388
Dad, those are, like,
old-people drugs.

1843
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:49,256
That's, like, what they
did on <i> the golden girls.</i>

1844
01:23:49,258 --> 01:23:50,824
Like, blanche did heroin.

1845
01:23:50,826 --> 01:23:53,160
All right,
I'll just sit here
and be silent.

1846
01:23:53,162 --> 01:23:55,763
Blanche never did heroin.

1847
01:23:55,765 --> 01:23:57,965
Okay, so, yangs,
you'll take my
dead roommate's spot.

1848
01:23:57,967 --> 01:23:59,299
Cool.
Dope.

1849
01:23:59,301 --> 01:24:01,168
Are you kidding me, yangs?
Are you fucking high?

1850
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,970
Of course.
Yeah, I am.

1851
01:24:02,972 --> 01:24:04,271
Jesus Christ,
have you ever heard of,

1852
01:24:04,273 --> 01:24:05,706
don't get high on
your own supply?

1853
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:06,840
We didn't.
Nah.

1854
01:24:06,842 --> 01:24:08,075
I didn't do that.

1855
01:24:08,077 --> 01:24:09,676
Yeah, I used his
and he used mine.

1856
01:24:09,678 --> 01:24:11,998
Okay, well, now I have
to make a fucking
example out of you.

1857
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:13,847
That's a gun.
Yeah.

1858
01:24:13,849 --> 01:24:15,682
Who first?

1859
01:24:15,684 --> 01:24:17,384
You want to go first?
I don't want to die.

1860
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:18,819
You die...
I don't want to die.

1861
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:20,320
You want to do
rock paper scissors?
Rock paper scissors?

1862
01:24:20,322 --> 01:24:21,655
That's how we'll do it.
That's how we'll do it.

1863
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,190
Fuck.

1864
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:24,858
Fuck.

1865
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:26,260
Fuck.

1866
01:24:26,262 --> 01:24:27,628
Yeah, we won't figure this out.

1867
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:29,229
- I'll shoot both of you.
- Darling.

1868
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:31,598
If you're going into
the family business,

1869
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,500
you will have to
have a clean record.

1870
01:24:33,502 --> 01:24:36,203
That's why we have
these guys to do it for us.

1871
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:39,773
Oh, fuck. Jinx.

1872
01:24:39,775 --> 01:24:40,741
We got to move right now.

1873
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:43,410
Buy me a coke
in heaven. Jinx again.

1874
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:44,892
Put your guns down!
Fucking guns down!

1875
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:46,480
Doug?

1876
01:24:46,482 --> 01:24:48,949
My name's not Doug,
it's schmidt.

1877
01:24:48,951 --> 01:24:50,751
And guess what,
we're cops.
Boom.

1878
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:53,454
Oh, my God.

1879
01:24:53,456 --> 01:24:55,689
Yeah, everybody knows.
Really?

1880
01:24:55,691 --> 01:24:59,126
You guys look like
the stars of a cop show
called <i> Hawaiian dads.</i>

1881
01:24:59,128 --> 01:25:01,728
All right,
enough is enough.
Boys, move in!

1882
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:03,564
- Oh, do we have company?
- Yeah!

1883
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:06,834
Drop your guns.
Drop yours first.

1884
01:25:06,836 --> 01:25:09,169
We have way
more guns than you.
Drop your fucking guns.

1885
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:10,370
Okay, that's a good point.

1886
01:25:10,372 --> 01:25:12,106
Wow.

1887
01:25:12,108 --> 01:25:14,741
I mean, was this
really your entire plan?

1888
01:25:14,743 --> 01:25:16,176
Coming in here with no backup?

1889
01:25:16,178 --> 01:25:19,213
Or maybe we had a far
more elaborate plan.
Mmm-hmm.

1890
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:21,548
Maybe my partner has
a tracking device in
his pocket right now.

1891
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:22,783
May... what?

1892
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:24,451
You had the fucking
tracking device.
I don't have it.

1893
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:26,086
That's the one fucking thing
you were supposed to remember.

1894
01:25:26,088 --> 01:25:27,988
You're the smart
person. You do the
tracking device shit.

1895
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,723
That's your domain.
I do the physical shit.

1896
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:31,825
You know what,
I may drag you down
sometimes,

1897
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:34,862
but every possible time
you can do something dumb,

1898
01:25:34,864 --> 01:25:36,330
you do the dumbest
possible thing.

1899
01:25:36,332 --> 01:25:37,998
No, the fucking
dumbest possible thing

1900
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,833
is letting two cops
blah-blah-blah

1901
01:25:39,835 --> 01:25:42,402
while other cops are
getting in position
to bust their shit in.

1902
01:25:42,404 --> 01:25:44,071
Oh, so you mean I brought
the tracking device.

1903
01:25:44,073 --> 01:25:46,140
Yeah.
What's up now, huh?

1904
01:25:46,142 --> 01:25:47,674
That seemed like
such a real argument.

1905
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:49,042
That's improv, bitch.

1906
01:25:49,044 --> 01:25:50,177
Move!

1907
01:25:51,946 --> 01:25:53,213
Spring break yourself, fool.

1908
01:25:55,116 --> 01:25:57,217
We shoot dicks off
here in jump street.

1909
01:26:00,388 --> 01:26:02,789
We're here, as well.

1910
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:05,826
We jump street,
and we about to
jump in yo' ass.

1911
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:08,529
Right in the crack.

1912
01:26:08,531 --> 01:26:09,897
Don't do it, leatherface.

1913
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:17,417
He's got the drugs!

1914
01:26:22,777 --> 01:26:25,112
This is so boring.
No one's getting shot.

1915
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:28,415
Oh, my God.

1916
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:31,785
Did you just get shot,
like, right after
I fucking said that?

1917
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:35,602
Can I have your gun?
It's bigger.

1918
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:37,858
Stop! I'll shoot you
in the ass!

1919
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:38,860
Dad!

1920
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,196
Maya?

1921
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:43,764
What are you doing here?

1922
01:26:43,766 --> 01:26:44,898
This is a shoot-out.

1923
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,500
You know what happens
in a shoot-out.

1924
01:26:46,502 --> 01:26:48,368
They always kidnap the girl.

1925
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,703
Not always.

1926
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:51,438
Mercedes?
You're coming with me.

1927
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,407
Bitch, please. I ain't
going nowhere with you.

1928
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:57,110
Now.

1929
01:26:57,112 --> 01:26:58,212
Dad, what do I do?

1930
01:26:58,214 --> 01:26:59,214
Is that my bathing suit?

1931
01:27:02,151 --> 01:27:03,417
Just ask. It's polite.

1932
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:06,820
You shot me in
my foot! Wait!

1933
01:27:06,822 --> 01:27:08,488
Move! Move faster now!

1934
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:11,058
I'm taking my time.
Shit, you shot me
in my goddamn foot.

1935
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,259
Doug? Doug!

1936
01:27:12,261 --> 01:27:13,627
Maya!

1937
01:27:13,629 --> 01:27:15,095
Mercedes just took
my dad that way!

1938
01:27:15,097 --> 01:27:16,463
Okay, we're on it.

1939
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,335
If I die,
I'm gonna kill both
of you motherfuckers!

1940
01:27:21,337 --> 01:27:23,417
Fuck. How are we
gonna catch him now?

1941
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,407
Lambo.

1942
01:27:30,478 --> 01:27:31,979
<i>Policia! Policia!</i>
Fuck off.

1943
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:33,981
Shit, there's ghost!

1944
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:36,116
What? What do we do?

1945
01:27:36,118 --> 01:27:37,484
Uh, we need to split up.

1946
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:40,153
Are you okay with that?

1947
01:27:40,155 --> 01:27:41,221
Yeah, I can do it.

1948
01:27:41,223 --> 01:27:42,556
Are you sure?

1949
01:27:42,558 --> 01:27:44,358
I need to drive,
'cause you're
faster on foot.

1950
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:45,826
What? I don't get
to drive the lambo?

1951
01:27:45,828 --> 01:27:47,761
No, you don't.
Come on, let's go!

1952
01:27:47,763 --> 01:27:49,596
But I want...
Who gives a shit about
the lambo? Just go!

1953
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:50,697
Let go of
the fucking keys!
I can't let 'em go.

1954
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:51,899
You're gonna have to take 'em.

1955
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,940
Take care of her, okay?
It'll be glorious,
I promise.

1956
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:56,156
How do you drive this thing?

1957
01:27:56,704 --> 01:27:58,272
You got to let
her drive you, bro.

1958
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:02,376
I can't get in.

1959
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:06,280
Hey!

1960
01:28:06,282 --> 01:28:07,514
Look where you're going!

1961
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:11,551
It's so confusing!

1962
01:28:18,426 --> 01:28:19,993
Easy, bitch.
My hands are hurting.

1963
01:28:22,664 --> 01:28:23,664
Whoa!

1964
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:29,436
You know who's
behind us in that car?

1965
01:28:29,438 --> 01:28:31,371
That's one of the best
drivers that we got.

1966
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:33,206
Fuck!

1967
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:35,342
Oh, shit.

1968
01:28:35,344 --> 01:28:36,984
- Fucking complicated.
- What is this?

1969
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:39,646
Holy shit!

1970
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:43,529
You fucked up me
driving a lamborghini,
you dick!

1971
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:46,987
Fuck you, doves!

1972
01:28:55,463 --> 01:28:57,964
<i>Puerto, Mexico,
let's hear you get crazy!</i>

1973
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:04,504
It's like a Batmobile.

1974
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:05,539
Come on, schmidt!

1975
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:09,643
Old man coming through!

1976
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,347
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

1977
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:16,416
Brad! Spring break!

1978
01:29:16,418 --> 01:29:17,658
Look, I can't, all right?

1979
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:20,320
Dude, I got to go.
I got to go.

1980
01:29:20,322 --> 01:29:21,822
This is quite enough.

1981
01:29:21,824 --> 01:29:23,690
You need to let me go
and drop all this.

1982
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:26,426
Get out of the way!

1983
01:29:30,798 --> 01:29:33,900
Tokyo drift!

1984
01:29:36,137 --> 01:29:38,605
That was way too fast
and pretty...

1985
01:29:38,607 --> 01:29:40,407
Way too...
A little bit too furious.

1986
01:29:40,409 --> 01:29:42,809
Schmidt!
Get over here!
I'm handcuffed!

1987
01:29:44,446 --> 01:29:46,480
Give it up, asshole!
And nice parking job!

1988
01:29:46,482 --> 01:29:48,081
Fuck! I'll be right back.

1989
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:49,449
I gotta go.
I'll be right back. Sorry.

1990
01:29:49,451 --> 01:29:51,451
That's a direct order,
motherfucker!
Come over here!

1991
01:29:59,927 --> 01:30:01,795
You are so old and weak!

1992
01:30:01,797 --> 01:30:04,131
Drop the fucking gun!
Seriously!

1993
01:30:04,133 --> 01:30:05,693
Get your wrinkly hands off me!

1994
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,204
Where the hell have you been?

1995
01:30:11,206 --> 01:30:12,539
Looking for you.

1996
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:14,207
I've been running like crazy!

1997
01:30:14,209 --> 01:30:15,475
Hey! Hey.

1998
01:30:17,678 --> 01:30:19,546
Want to fight like a man?

1999
01:30:19,548 --> 01:30:21,381
Then you better
fight like two men.

2000
01:30:21,383 --> 01:30:22,383
Hey.
Hey.

2001
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:25,552
Really? More twins?

2002
01:30:28,656 --> 01:30:30,023
Get up, old man river!

2003
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:32,626
Come on!
Hey.

2004
01:30:32,628 --> 01:30:34,127
Get up and hit me,
you fucking pussy!

2005
01:30:34,129 --> 01:30:36,129
I'm not gonna fight
a girl, so just stop!

2006
01:30:36,131 --> 01:30:37,497
It shouldn't matter.

2007
01:30:37,499 --> 01:30:39,499
If you thought
of me as a person
instead of a woman,

2008
01:30:39,501 --> 01:30:41,181
you would hit me and
not feel bad about it.

2009
01:30:42,904 --> 01:30:44,571
Okay.
Bring it!

2010
01:30:44,573 --> 01:30:46,106
I'm ready.

2011
01:30:46,108 --> 01:30:47,641
It's on now, dawg.

2012
01:30:48,142 --> 01:30:49,443
Girl fight.

2013
01:30:51,513 --> 01:30:53,847
Oh. Oh.
Oh, my God.

2014
01:30:53,849 --> 01:30:55,415
Is there blood in my eye?
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

2015
01:30:55,417 --> 01:30:56,850
I think there's blood in my eye.

2016
01:30:56,852 --> 01:30:58,452
Fucking learn how to hit!

2017
01:31:00,388 --> 01:31:02,088
That's a little better!

2018
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:04,210
That's a little better,
motherfucker!
Come on! Come on!

2019
01:31:07,862 --> 01:31:09,963
No! No!
What?

2020
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:11,898
What were you doing?
What am I doing?

2021
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:13,166
Why'd you try to kiss me?

2022
01:31:13,168 --> 01:31:14,334
I didn't fucking
try and kiss you!

2023
01:31:14,336 --> 01:31:16,536
Yes, you did.
Ooh, you're so weird!

2024
01:31:16,538 --> 01:31:18,371
You're fucking
Mr. and Mrs. Smith-ing me.

2025
01:31:18,373 --> 01:31:19,873
I'm not
Mr. and Mrs. Smith-ing you.

2026
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:21,241
This wasn't a sexy fight.

2027
01:31:21,243 --> 01:31:23,543
Oh, like you haven't
wanted to kiss me
the whole time.

2028
01:31:23,545 --> 01:31:25,879
I never once wanted to kiss you!

2029
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:27,747
Never! No!

2030
01:31:27,749 --> 01:31:28,849
You just did it again!
Stop it!
Stop!

2031
01:31:28,851 --> 01:31:30,383
You're making a face
that is sexy!

2032
01:31:30,385 --> 01:31:32,185
I don't even want to kiss you!

2033
01:31:32,187 --> 01:31:33,553
Then stop trying!

2034
01:31:33,555 --> 01:31:34,988
You keep trying!

2035
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,623
I've never tried to kiss you.

2036
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:37,557
You gave me kiss me eyes.

2037
01:31:37,559 --> 01:31:38,959
No, I didn't.

2038
01:31:38,961 --> 01:31:40,794
The eyes were
I just got punched
in the face eyes.

2039
01:31:40,796 --> 01:31:42,062
They weren't kiss me eyes.

2040
01:31:42,064 --> 01:31:43,296
I don't even like you!

2041
01:31:43,298 --> 01:31:45,065
Neither do I,
so stop kissing me!

2042
01:31:45,067 --> 01:31:46,199
Okay!

2043
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:49,202
No! You're leaning
in again!

2044
01:31:49,204 --> 01:31:50,737
I didn't know
if we were gonna
punch or kiss!

2045
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:52,239
You're making this
so uncomfortable.

2046
01:31:52,241 --> 01:31:55,108
This is the most
uncomfortable fistfight
I've ever been in.

2047
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:56,643
I'm gonna give you
an out by punching
you in the face.

2048
01:31:56,645 --> 01:31:58,111
Okay?
Okay.

2049
01:31:58,113 --> 01:31:59,813
And then we're gonna
go back to fighting

2050
01:31:59,815 --> 01:32:01,081
and we'll pretend
this never happened,

2051
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:02,148
'cause I feel so awkward.

2052
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:18,932
<i>I want to see you get crazy!</i>

2053
01:32:24,338 --> 01:32:25,338
Whoo!

2054
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:52,799
I fucking hate spring break!

2055
01:32:56,003 --> 01:32:57,270
Fuck!

2056
01:32:57,272 --> 01:32:58,272
Ow!

2057
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:04,344
Are you kidding me?
It's plastic.

2058
01:33:04,346 --> 01:33:05,979
Doesn't even hurt!
Okay...

2059
01:33:05,981 --> 01:33:07,541
This isn't
the spring break
you imagined?

2060
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:09,115
How about this?
You want a little fun?

2061
01:33:09,117 --> 01:33:10,216
What is that?

2062
01:33:10,218 --> 01:33:11,518
Get wet, baby!

2063
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,186
So much lube in my face!

2064
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:15,589
Oh.

2065
01:33:15,591 --> 01:33:17,057
Lube on my face.

2066
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:22,729
You're so violent!

2067
01:33:22,731 --> 01:33:24,831
Get off me unless
you're gonna fuck me!

2068
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:26,099
I'm not gonna fuck you!

2069
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:27,767
Are we gonna fuck?
No, we're not!

2070
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:29,035
Is that what's happening?

2071
01:33:29,037 --> 01:33:30,637
No! I'm not gonna
fuck you, ever!

2072
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:32,072
Get off!

2073
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:41,715
Hey!

2074
01:33:42,483 --> 01:33:43,683
Hey!

2075
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,453
What? What are
you gonna do?

2076
01:33:46,455 --> 01:33:48,655
Choke me with your
liver-spotted hands?

2077
01:33:48,657 --> 01:33:50,423
You gonna push me over
with your Walker?

2078
01:33:50,425 --> 01:33:52,025
I'm impressed you
caught up to me.

2079
01:33:52,027 --> 01:33:53,326
You probably
haven't run that fast

2080
01:33:53,328 --> 01:33:54,794
since you played
stickball in the field

2081
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:56,696
behind old pop
wiggleby's sweet shop.

2082
01:33:57,598 --> 01:33:59,366
Freeze, bitch.
Oh, thank God.

2083
01:33:59,368 --> 01:34:01,935
Look who got off
the motherfucking leash.

2084
01:34:01,937 --> 01:34:03,370
Now who's the damsel
in distress?
Fuck!

2085
01:34:03,372 --> 01:34:05,772
Well, I guess it's him.

2086
01:34:05,774 --> 01:34:06,940
I don't have
a clean shot, schmidt.

2087
01:34:06,942 --> 01:34:08,208
Then don't take the shot!

2088
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:10,276
Maybe I want to
take a dirty shot.

2089
01:34:10,278 --> 01:34:12,412
Kind of like the dirty shot
you took on my daughter.

2090
01:34:12,414 --> 01:34:15,649
I didn't take a dirty shot
on your daughter, okay?

2091
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:18,385
We talked a lot,
and we care about
each other.

2092
01:34:18,387 --> 01:34:20,053
All the good qualities you have,

2093
01:34:20,055 --> 01:34:21,988
I can feel inside of Maya.

2094
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:23,223
I'm gonna take the shot.

2095
01:34:23,225 --> 01:34:24,924
Don't take the shot.

2096
01:34:24,926 --> 01:34:26,192
I can shoot right
through your shoulder,

2097
01:34:26,194 --> 01:34:27,794
hit the bitch
right in the chest.

2098
01:34:27,796 --> 01:34:29,629
Don't take the shot.
I'm taking the shot.

2099
01:34:29,631 --> 01:34:30,864
I'll take the fucking shot.

2100
01:34:30,866 --> 01:34:32,465
Nobody take the shot before me.

2101
01:34:32,467 --> 01:34:34,300
How about we
take it at the same time?
No one take a shot.

2102
01:34:34,302 --> 01:34:35,902
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

2103
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:41,041
Shit! You have the right
to remain silent...

2104
01:34:41,043 --> 01:34:42,375
No, no, no, I got this.

2105
01:34:42,377 --> 01:34:44,144
You go handle the ghost.
He's on the roof.

2106
01:34:44,146 --> 01:34:45,712
I'm on it.
I got it.

2107
01:34:45,714 --> 01:34:47,814
- What you looking at?
- Oh!

2108
01:34:47,816 --> 01:34:49,315
Good job on the cuffs,
baby girl.

2109
01:34:57,392 --> 01:34:59,092
So many fucking stairs.

2110
01:35:04,799 --> 01:35:07,067
It's me! It's me!
Shit.

2111
01:35:07,069 --> 01:35:08,629
You made it, dude.
Did you get Mercedes?

2112
01:35:08,903 --> 01:35:10,403
Yeah. All by myself.

2113
01:35:10,405 --> 01:35:12,138
Really?

2114
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:14,741
Mainly by myself.
Okay.

2115
01:35:14,743 --> 01:35:16,676
And, dude, you were right,
that lambo...

2116
01:35:16,678 --> 01:35:18,078
Just can't hear that right now.

2117
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,612
It's a shitty-made car.
It's not good.

2118
01:35:19,614 --> 01:35:20,880
Hey, let's go.
We got to go.

2119
01:35:20,882 --> 01:35:22,082
How many bullets you got left?

2120
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,350
None.

2121
01:35:24,352 --> 01:35:25,632
Act like you have bullets, then.

2122
01:35:36,697 --> 01:35:38,465
We gotta go!

2123
01:35:38,467 --> 01:35:39,587
We have to wait for pudding!

2124
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:49,142
Jenko!

2125
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:02,188
Go, go!

2126
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,227
Here, take this.
Okay.

2127
01:36:07,229 --> 01:36:08,328
I tried to take
a bullet for you, man.

2128
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:09,696
Yeah. But you didn't.

2129
01:36:09,698 --> 01:36:11,731
But I tried.
It's the thought
that matters.

2130
01:36:11,733 --> 01:36:12,899
No, it's not
the thought that counts.

2131
01:36:12,901 --> 01:36:14,141
It's fucking taking the bullet.

2132
01:36:18,372 --> 01:36:19,506
Cover me.
I'm gonna go long.

2133
01:36:20,141 --> 01:36:21,241
Okay.

2134
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:48,034
Bye-bye, Terminator!

2135
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:03,583
Hey! Get off
of my chopper!

2136
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:06,186
Can you shake him off?

2137
01:37:06,188 --> 01:37:08,555
I'm coming for you,
motherfucker!

2138
01:37:08,557 --> 01:37:10,597
Come on,
just wiggle the stick
back and forth!

2139
01:37:12,026 --> 01:37:13,459
He's only got one arm!

2140
01:37:13,461 --> 01:37:15,295
I only need one arm to
punch you in the dick.

2141
01:37:16,964 --> 01:37:18,164
Shake him off! Shake him off!

2142
01:37:18,866 --> 01:37:20,366
Don't be a pussy!

2143
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:53,933
Holy shit!

2144
01:37:53,935 --> 01:37:55,835
I did it!

2145
01:37:55,837 --> 01:37:57,604
I look so fucking badass!

2146
01:37:57,606 --> 01:37:58,705
Oh, my God, you flew!

2147
01:37:58,707 --> 01:37:59,772
This is crazy!

2148
01:37:59,774 --> 01:38:00,974
You made the leap, man!

2149
01:38:00,976 --> 01:38:02,342
Why'd you do that?

2150
01:38:02,344 --> 01:38:04,010
'Cause you did it!

2151
01:38:04,012 --> 01:38:05,411
I couldn't leave
you hanging, man!

2152
01:38:05,413 --> 01:38:06,746
What are you talking about?
I was fine. I had it.

2153
01:38:06,748 --> 01:38:07,748
You weren't...

2154
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:17,023
I got you!
Shit! Schmidt!

2155
01:38:17,025 --> 01:38:18,191
I got you!

2156
01:38:18,193 --> 01:38:19,392
You saved my life!

2157
01:38:31,639 --> 01:38:33,907
I just realized something.

2158
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:35,842
You don't hold me down, man.

2159
01:38:35,844 --> 01:38:37,076
You lift me up.

2160
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:39,579
Literally and figuratively.

2161
01:38:39,581 --> 01:38:40,621
Yeah, I know.
I meant both.

2162
01:38:41,482 --> 01:38:43,349
You don't drag me down,
either, man.

2163
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:44,984
I mean, except right now.

2164
01:38:44,986 --> 01:38:47,420
You're dragging me down.
You're really heavy.

2165
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:49,455
Hey, listen, there's
a grenade in my shorts.

2166
01:38:49,457 --> 01:38:50,690
Can you reach it?

2167
01:38:50,692 --> 01:38:52,358
You gotta go in from underneath.

2168
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:53,459
Oh, shit!

2169
01:38:57,064 --> 01:38:58,498
Is that it?
That's my dick.

2170
01:38:58,500 --> 01:38:59,699
What about that?

2171
01:38:59,701 --> 01:39:00,701
That's my dick also.

2172
01:39:02,504 --> 01:39:04,337
Why is it hard?

2173
01:39:04,339 --> 01:39:06,406
I have so much
adrenaline right now!

2174
01:39:06,408 --> 01:39:08,141
Is that it?
You're tickling me.

2175
01:39:08,143 --> 01:39:09,409
I can't find it!

2176
01:39:09,411 --> 01:39:10,411
That's it! Grab it!

2177
01:39:12,046 --> 01:39:13,212
Yes!

2178
01:39:13,214 --> 01:39:14,914
No, I got it in my mouth.

2179
01:39:14,916 --> 01:39:16,215
Say something cool
when you throw it!

2180
01:39:16,217 --> 01:39:18,184
One, two, three!

2181
01:39:20,054 --> 01:39:22,221
Something cool!

2182
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:28,628
They're gone!

2183
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:31,564
Oh, I feel so...

2184
01:39:37,871 --> 01:39:39,138
Whoo-hoo!

2185
01:40:06,567 --> 01:40:07,867
We did it!

2186
01:40:07,869 --> 01:40:09,035
Dude, fuck, I'm... ow!

2187
01:40:09,037 --> 01:40:11,070
Oh! Shit, sorry.

2188
01:40:11,072 --> 01:40:12,405
Dude, I miss you so much, man.

2189
01:40:12,407 --> 01:40:13,906
I miss you, too.

2190
01:40:13,908 --> 01:40:15,808
You were like a tiny
little flower seed

2191
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:18,411
and I was clenching you
in my fist.

2192
01:40:18,413 --> 01:40:20,880
But a flower,
it can't grow in a fist.

2193
01:40:20,882 --> 01:40:24,217
A little seed needs
to fly away free
and find its soil.

2194
01:40:24,219 --> 01:40:27,253
Yeah, I know.
I tried to soil myself and,
dude, I didn't like it.

2195
01:40:27,255 --> 01:40:29,489
I wanted a relationship
without friction.

2196
01:40:29,491 --> 01:40:31,591
Dude, you need friction
to create fire.

2197
01:40:31,593 --> 01:40:34,360
And that's what we have,
we have fire.

2198
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:36,596
Dude, I'm in.
I'm all in.

2199
01:40:36,598 --> 01:40:38,097
Thank God.

2200
01:40:38,099 --> 01:40:40,933
Dude, this is what
I've always wanted.
Just me and you, buddy.

2201
01:40:40,935 --> 01:40:42,335
I love you.

2202
01:40:42,337 --> 01:40:43,703
Me, too, man.
I love you, man.

2203
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:48,441
You know what?

2204
01:40:48,443 --> 01:40:49,763
That's who he should
be with, man.

2205
01:40:51,478 --> 01:40:53,746
What?

2206
01:40:53,748 --> 01:40:55,715
Hey, what'd you say
when you threw
the grenade up there?

2207
01:40:55,717 --> 01:40:56,883
I said, something cool.

2208
01:40:56,885 --> 01:40:58,384
What did you say?

2209
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:00,153
It was something cool.
No, but what'd you say?

2210
01:41:00,155 --> 01:41:01,635
Yeah, I know.
I said, something cool.

2211
01:41:04,491 --> 01:41:07,226
I didn't expect
spring break to be
this stinky.

2212
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:09,362
It's pretty gross.

2213
01:41:09,364 --> 01:41:12,065
Man, we're getting
