538
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,282
that all the money raised...

539
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:43,160
will go to the family fund
here at El Pueblito

540
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:44,703
So cough it up!

541
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,831
Straight from Juarez...

542
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,083

00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,126
Magno!

544
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,588
That's Magno.
He's running in fourth.

545
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,424
And there's no way he can beat Blue Demon Jr.
He's a champion.

546
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,801
And the legendary...
Blue Demon Jr.

are like the best.

They're like the shit, man.

553
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:18,237

we went to go see his match.

knock this shit off, kid.

556
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,666
Come on.
Get yourself another habit.

557
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,043
Sugar. Here.

558
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:35,587
Get yourself an ice cream.

559
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,340

Bring me back the change.

560

Hey-
Hey-

562
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,354
Why the money?

563
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,189
Ah, you know,
he worries too much.

564
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:55,691
He needs to be
a kid for a while.

565
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:56,942
Why, you gonna hit me again?

566
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:59,861
(CHUCKLES) He does
worry too much.

567
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,363
Today he looks happy.

568
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,283
He talks about you.
Told me about your dad.

569
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:07,411
And how you talked him out
of something stupid.

570
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,705
That's not easy.

571
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,540
Well, he's smart.
He listens.

572
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,208
He doesn't talk
to many people.

573
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,334
No?

574
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,005

00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,056
Oh, I have a visitor.
I'm sorry.

580
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,391
Mmm-hmm.

581
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:31,435
I'll take you up on the beer later.
Thank you.

582
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:38,567
Right.

583
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,905

contribution to our families.

Don't mention it.

00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,792

by the way.

He did want a cremation,
didn't he?

592
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,091
Oh, l didn't
know him that well.

593
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:05,594
We have a serious problem.

594
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,764
Is this something
I can help you with?

595
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,183
Well, the thing is, two of
the cops that were with us

596
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,352
when we first met,
turned up dead.

597
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:17,022
Cops die all the time,
it's part of the trade.

598
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:20,275
What is disturbing is the
fact they were tortured.

599
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,194
Badly.

600
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,780
So we wanted to ask you
where you got the money.

601
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:28,658
We are just concerned that
someone might be looking for it.

602
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,952
And if they are,
we need to know who it is.

603
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:33,246
I see. Two million bucks
is a lot of money.

604
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:36,375
Two million dollars is a lot
of money, you're right.

605
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:40,754
Well, it says here they were
found in a brand new Mercedes.

606
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:42,672
What... What model was it?

607
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:49,638
Listen, things can get
a lot worse for you in here.

608
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,057
Oh, let me guess, you've
got friends in here, too.

609
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,477
Well, I'm sure Javi's power
stretches outside these walls.

610
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,479
I mean, he knows about the
money you stole from me, yeah?

611
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,064
I mean, you gave him
his cut, right?

612
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,899
Listen, you fucking gringo!

613
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,901
You may think you have
this place figured out,

614
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,528
but you don't know shit!

615
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:05,987
Just tell us where
you got the money.

616
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,781
I'll tell you what,

617
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:10,951
whoever tortured those cops
surely knows you're in here.

618
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,661
If you tell us,
we could help.

619
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:15,580
Otherwise, it's just a matter of
time before they come get you.

620
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,459
No, you're right.

621
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:22,254
And here's the thing, and I'm
sure you two will agree with me,

622
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,256
they'll be coming
to get you two first.

623
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:27,843
So here's my advice stop
spending my fucking money.

624
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,263
Put it someplace safe and then
go and hide yourselves. Okay?

625
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,307
Because when they find you,
they will kill you.

626
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,309
And then I'll never
get my damn money!

627
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,937
Suit yourself. And watch
your back in here!

628
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,273
Yeah, take it easy
out there.

659
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,322
Come here.

00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:16,284
Yeah. Well, you spot,
I'll shoot. Come here.

I thought. Here.

Oh. Here. And I got this
for you, too.

What is it?
Nicotine gum.

What does it do?
Yeah. Stops the craving.

667
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,921
Don't flash it around.
Don't spend it in big chunks,

668
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:30,340
that's how
you get boned, okay.

669
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,884

that beer now?

I was a user.
That's how we met.

674
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,812
Then I helped him out,
cutting the shit.

675
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,438
Packing it...

676
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,232

with three kilos.

Yeah. You remind me
of someone.

682
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:05,375
Yes. If you tell him,
I'll kick your ass.

683
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,501
Again?

684
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:07,544
Worse.

685
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,423
Where is he? Is he around?

686
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:13,967
I think he went for a beer.

687
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:15,135
What?

688
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,845
Oh, shut up.

689
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:21,516
So, guero, you married?

690
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,603
Easy, mamacita,
you're moving a little fast.

691
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,689
That's a very
sensitive subject for me.

692
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:30,567
I was. Um...

693
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,361
She ran off with a former
business associate of mine,

694
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:34,863
one Reginald T. Barnes.

695
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:37,449
We were doing a job,
I got away...

696
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,534
He got caught.

697
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:41,077
He ratted me out
for immunity,

698
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:42,871
and I did seven years
in the slammer.

699
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,748
She ended up
shacking up with him.

700
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,416
Nice, huh?

701
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:49,961
You know, I still have
recurring dreams about it.

Yeah, there's a knock
on the door.

he's wearing underpants

704
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,301
and eating a bowl
of cornflakes, weird, huh?

705
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:57,886
Mmm.
Yeah. Not a pretty sight.

706
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,721
There's milk spilling
down his chin and shit.

707
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,766
And my wife's making
coffee over behind him.

708
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,059
And these two goons
at the door,

709
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,393
whip out these
massive cannons...

710
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:08,730
(MIMICS GUN FIRING) And they start
filling his chest full of holes,

711
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,357
he hits the floor,
dead as a mackerel.

712
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,901
She drops the coffee and
starts screaming her ass off.

713

Thank for taking
my call, sir.

1083
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:30,404
Well, it's quite
a surprise, Mr. Eastwood.

1084
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:31,738
I'm a fan of your work.

1086
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,118
You know what, man? This is
not what you guaranteed me.

1087
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:37,285
Excuse me
for a minute, sir.

1088

what you said.

1089

Okay, move along.

Sorry, sir.
I'm a workin' stiff.

for you, Mr. Eastwood?

1098
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:58,348
Well, you know,
I'm going to be

1099
01:06:58,432 --> 01:06:59,725
in San Diego
for a couple of days

1100
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,727

1101
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:04,271
and all the proceeds are going
to the Stroke Association.

you know.

be part of
the Stroke Association.

1107

It's doing good
in the community

1108
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:18,201
and it's a damn
decent tax write-off.

1109
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:19,870
Well, it sounds interesting.

1110
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:22,831
You think you could make it to
my office tomorrow morning?

1111
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:26,460
Yeah, I'll have
my assistant, Mr. Barnes,

1112
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:27,669

your assistant.
