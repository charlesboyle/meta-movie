1
00:00:41,537 --> 00:00:45,290
My name is Steven Arthur Younger.

2
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:47,375
I am an American citizen.

3
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:07,228
My name is Steven Arthur Younger
and I am an American citizen.

4
00:01:07,313 --> 00:01:09,064
I have ...

5
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:15,320
I have ... I have ...

6
00:01:16,322 --> 00:01:18,573
I have certain demands.

7
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:38,760
In the name of Allah the merciful,
and his prophet Muhammad,

8
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:41,930
peace be upon him.

9
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:46,643
My name is Yusuf Atta Mohamed.

10
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:50,230
My former name is 
Steven Arthur Younger.

11
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:49,706
Trace has been on him for three 
weeks now, turned up nothing.

12
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,751
Goes to mosque, spends time with 
his family, he meets friends for tea.

13
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:57,380
Okay, I'll keep the surveillance guys 
on him another week, then I'll pull.

14
00:02:57,464 --> 00:02:59,924
Sorry I'm late.
I was going over the phone logs.

15
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,759
What else do we got? D.J.?

16
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:03,011
Yeah.

17
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:05,555
Threat Squad sent us a poison pen.

18
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,142
Another flight school called
about an Arab-sounding man ...

19
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:11,186
wanting to take flying lessons.

20
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,688
Flight school?
My record's three in one week.

21
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:15,023
Hang-gliding schools don't count.

22
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:18,943
Okay, guys, but we got to check him out.
I'm sorry, but, get into it, please.

23
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:26,075
Headquarters are doing their 
review next week.

24
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,535
We don't have much 
for show-and-tell.

25
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,078
We're on top of things.

26
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:30,830
Yeah.

27
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:33,416
Helen, I think that I may have
something here.

28
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,754
I went back over those new files from 
CIA and I found this. Henry Humphries.

29
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:39,547
Now there's actually nothing 
about him in the file,

30
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:42,717
it's all been redacted,
but his wife Rina is a Bosnian.

31
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:43,885
- Bosnian?
- Yes.

32
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:45,970
And from what I can tell
through all the redacting,

33
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:49,432
she was involved in certain objectionable
activities during the war there.

34
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:52,560
It doesn't say what, but she's a devout 
Muslim, she lives this side of town.

35
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:55,980
So why doesn't she go to our mosque?
So, I called CIA and asked for open ...

36
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:57,398
Phil.

37
00:03:57,483 --> 00:03:58,900
A, we have no Bosnian connection,

38
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:00,652
B, Muslim women
don't have to go to mosque,

39
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:05,490
and C, if anyone is going to ask a favor
of another agency, it will be me.

40
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:07,367
Oh, shoot.

41
00:04:08,744 --> 00:04:11,746
Right. Okay, I'm sorry.

42
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,830
Phil?

43
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,754
It's good work. 
Why don't you look into it?

44
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:23,049
Okay.

45
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:24,717
Yes. Thank you.

46
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:28,930
You were a first office 
agent once too, you know.

47
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:31,015
Yeah, I don't really remember.

48
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:34,602
I'm gonna go inside,
fix you guys some lunch, okay?

49
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,687
Okay.

50
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:43,695
Who's that?

51
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:47,448
Oh, it's the mailman.

52
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:51,035
No. It's the mailwoman today.

53
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:53,204
She's cute. You want to see?

54
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:55,707
You always check out 
the postal workers?

55
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,125
Every day.

56
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:59,794
... and we want to cooperate 
here on this.

57
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:02,505
Now a dangerous fugitive
is apparently wanted ...

58
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:05,758
in connection with a shooting
that took place earlier today.

59
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:08,469
Yeah, I understand,

60
00:05:08,554 --> 00:05:09,846
but just because 
he's buying fertilizer,

61
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,849
doesn't necessarily mean
he's making a bomb.

62
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,936
I don't know, maybe he's planting
a garden full of roses for all I know.

63
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:19,022
Do you recognize this man?

64
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:23,818
His name is Steven Arthur Younger,
he's originally from Akron, Ohio.

65
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:26,321
He is considered extremely dangerous
and should not be approached ...

66
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:27,822
You guys seen this?

67
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:30,867
Aroused by the news girl, Vince?
Sexy voice, sexy blond hair.

68
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:34,412
Aroused? Last time he got 
aroused was 1978.

69
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:36,664
Yeah, with your mother.

70
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,834
A nationwide ...

71
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,130
In addition, authorities have given 
us pictures of these locations.

72
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:49,010
If you can identify these places,
please call the 800 number on your ...

73
00:05:49,678 --> 00:05:50,845
Federal authorities
are asking for your help ...

74
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:53,181
It's on every channel. 
Who authorized this?

75
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:56,059
Leo, call the Phoenix PD, will you?
Find out what's going on.

76
00:05:56,143 --> 00:06:00,021
That suspect has been identified
as Steven Arthur Younger,

77
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:02,523
and he's wanted in connection with 
the murder of a police officer ...

78
00:06:02,608 --> 00:06:03,983
I recognize this guy.

79
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:07,862
Phoenix PD
doesn't know anything about this.

80
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:09,280
All their guys are accounted for.

81
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:11,282
Who's covering this guy, Younger?

82
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:13,284
- Oh, shit, he's one of mine.
- Get his file.

83
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,828
Vince, get the Phoenix Field 
Office on the line.

84
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:17,872
Why does the TV 
have this before we do?

85
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:21,876
All right. Steven Arthur Younger,
member of the King Fahad Mosque.

86
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,837
No current address, no record,
no history of extremism.

87
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:28,132
Says here that he served U.S. Army, but 
his military file must be classified ...

88
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:30,510
because there's nothing in it.
- Why isn't that on the board?

89
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:34,180
Hi, this is Special Agent Paul Vincent
from the FBI Los Angeles Field Office.

90
00:06:34,264 --> 00:06:35,306
I need everything you've got ...

91
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:39,102
on a Steven Arthur Younger, age 38.
- Helen?

92
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:41,813
Have you seen these news reports?

93
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:43,606
This guy, Younger,
you got anything on him?

94
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,443
The suspect has been identified
as Steven Arthur Younger,

95
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:50,738
and he's wanted in connection with 
the murder of a police officer ...

96
00:06:50,823 --> 00:06:53,324
and the abduction of 
two young children.

97
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:59,122
- We need to bring them all in.
- What?

98
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:01,499
Can I talk to you in your office?

99
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:10,049
We need to question their families,
their friends, their business associates,

100
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:11,968
every single potential 
terrorist link ...

101
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:13,886
you've been tracking
for the last nine months,

102
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:16,013
and we have to do it right now.

103
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:17,098
That's hundreds of people, Jack.

104
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:18,266
We don't have the 
manpower to do that.

105
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,476
We're getting them.
As many agents as we want.

106
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:23,438
And we can enlist local law 
enforcement if we need it.

107
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:26,107
We need to find this guy 
and those places.

108
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:28,443
Drop everything else. 
This is top priority.

109
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:31,362
Okay. Can I know what 
this is about?

110
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:32,905
It's a classified 
directive from D.C.

111
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,492
You'll be briefed soon enough,
but you better get on it.

112
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:44,500
"So Papa Bear, Mama Bear and 
Baby Bear all fell fast asleep."

113
00:07:46,545 --> 00:07:48,087
- You believe it's true?
- No.

114
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:50,006
Yeah.

115
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,632
- Think I'm making it up?
- Yeah.

116
00:07:51,717 --> 00:07:54,051
- No! You?
- No.

117
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:01,392
Why don't you guys go 
to your room,

118
00:08:01,477 --> 00:08:06,230
find the bears, make sure they're all 
asleep, okay? Go! Go ahead. Hurry. Run.

119
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:12,445
Hello?

120
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:14,989
Hi, I'm Agent Phillips,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

121
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:16,699
I'd like to come in and ask you
a few questions, please.

122
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:18,784
-We found them!
-We got them!

123
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:22,538
Good! Good, sweetie pie. Come, 
let's put them all to bed. Let's go!

124
00:08:26,877 --> 00:08:28,377
Hey, I was just about to call you.

125
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:30,922
- Do I have a problem?
- With what? What's happened?

126
00:08:31,298 --> 00:08:34,592
Well, there's some guys outside my 
gate claiming to be from the FBI.

127
00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:36,802
That's impossible.
Nobody knows where you are.

128
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:37,970
You don't know anything about this?

129
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:40,973
No. But I'm on it. I'll get 
straight back to you.

130
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:44,602
No, I'll take care of it. But 
you need to relocate us immediately.

131
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:45,686
H., listen to me.

132
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:47,480
This is my family.

133
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:49,190
Goddamn it.

134
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:53,194
We've got 80 suspects down there,
more on the way.

135
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:54,946
These are a 'Yes', these are a 'No'.

136
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,116
You make it damn clear that it may be
a military facility, but we have custody.

137
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:01,577
Of course you read them their rights.
What kind of question is that?

138
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:02,703
Can you hold, please?

139
00:09:02,788 --> 00:09:05,206
Just found out that Younger has 
an ex-wife and two small children.

140
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,124
They left the house five days ago,
haven't been seen since.

141
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:10,878
Put a material witness warrant on her.
She's bound to know something. Find her.

142
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,466
Hey, Mike, I'm gonna 
have to call you back.

143
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:18,135
- Brody.
- Special Agent Brody,

144
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,470
my name is Charles Thompson.

145
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:21,722
I'm connected with the Defense 
Intelligence Agency.

146
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:24,559
I need to discuss with you a matter 
of extreme national security.

147
00:09:24,643 --> 00:09:26,060
What do you mean, connected?

148
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:28,938
- Listen to me.
- How did you get my personal number?

149
00:09:29,022 --> 00:09:30,731
You got a thousand new files today.

150
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:33,276
I wouldn't know that or your number
if I wasn't for real, right?

151
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,819
I'm not gonna discuss this with you.

152
00:09:34,903 --> 00:09:39,657
Listen to me, please. A CIA file 
was sent earlier to you in error.

153
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:44,036
Name of Henry Humphries. It's a mistake.
He's an extremely dangerous man.

154
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:45,705
- Please hoId.
- No!

155
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:49,292
- Who is that?
- I don't know. Nobody has this number.

156
00:09:49,376 --> 00:09:50,668
I have a lot of files here.

157
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:52,628
I know you got the goddamn file!

158
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:55,464
If you sent people there,
withdraw them immediately.

159
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:59,093
Do not approach him. I repeat, 
you must not approach him.

160
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:00,219
Can you hold?

161
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:03,639
- Phillips and Huntley went there.
- Call them.

162
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,602
"Personal information restricted.
This man is armed and dangerous.

163
00:10:07,686 --> 00:10:11,105
"No approach to be made to subject
or family under any circumstances.

164
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:15,860
"Department heads, contact Charles 
Thompson before any other action."

165
00:10:15,944 --> 00:10:17,445
- They're not answering.
- Oh, shit.

166
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,405
Okay, I'm on it. D.J. , let's go!

167
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:33,044
That's their car.

168
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:45,222
- Camera.
- The door is open. Go.

169
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:53,773
I'm in here.

170
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:56,817
FBI! Move to the door 
so I can see you!

171
00:10:57,402 --> 00:10:59,070
Show me your badge.

172
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:02,448
- Right here.
- Let me see it!

173
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:04,909
Right here!

174
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,703
Coming out.

175
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:18,589
You take one more step 
and I'll shoot.

176
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:19,757
Oh, please.

177
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:24,929
- Put the gun down.
- No way.

178
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:26,722
Not you. Her.

179
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:29,350
Put it on the mantel. 
Back away, slowly.

180
00:11:33,146 --> 00:11:35,106
Hands on your head!

181
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,691
- Hands on your head!
- Lower your voice!

182
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:38,567
Do not frighten my children.

183
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:42,446
Who the fuck sent you 
idiots to my house?

184
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,378
- I'm Special Agent Brody.
- Where are my children?

185
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:58,921
With your wife. They're fine.

186
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:02,091
You have a file on me?

187
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:06,220
Henry Harold Humphries.
Is that your real name?

188
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:09,306
- What do you think?
- You've been read your rights?

189
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:11,600
- My guy's coming.
- No one knows you're here.

190
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:14,687
Did you send these assholes to my 
house? Are you responsible for that?

191
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,397
Do you have a first name 
you can give me?

192
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:17,481
A real one?

193
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:20,568
Okay, okay, let's play the game.

194
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:23,112
You can call me H.

195
00:12:23,196 --> 00:12:24,822
What's your first name, 
Agent Brody?

196
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:27,074
You kidnapped and detained
two federal agents.

197
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,868
- You admit to that, right?
- They came to my house.

198
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:31,203
My children were there.
I could've killed them.

199
00:12:31,288 --> 00:12:33,831
So you think you're 
above the law, is that it?

200
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:39,420
Do you recognize this man?

201
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:41,714
Yeah. He's on TV, right?

202
00:12:43,216 --> 00:12:44,800
Helen, I'm sorry, 
this interview is terminated.

203
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:46,302
I depend on you. Come on!

204
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:50,264
It's a screw-up. Your name is 
on some list CIA sent the FBI.

205
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:52,767
No one told me. I can't 
believe you let this happen.

206
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:54,769
You sent us his file. 
Don't blame FBI.

207
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:57,688
Really? Did you check the leads
against the DIA priority list ...

208
00:12:57,773 --> 00:12:59,607
with the little red tags saying
"Do Not Touch"?

209
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:00,858
Wait, he's under protection?

210
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:02,735
This is my life.
How could you screw this up?

211
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:05,905
He's a target. He thought your guys
were killers. Sorry about that.

212
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:08,115
Thanks for your heart-felt 
fucking apology.

213
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Who are you?

214
00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:11,327
Probably best not to ask.

215
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:16,999
Jack, what's going on?

216
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,376
Can I talk to you for a second?

217
00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:25,466
I can't give you all 
the details right now,

218
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,094
but we're being moved
to a centralized command facility.

219
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:31,931
You gonna help me 
with this one, okay?

220
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:33,265
Okay, of course.

221
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:36,060
But where is this facility?

222
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:39,730
It's classified.

223
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:03,087
What the hell is this place?

224
00:14:10,637 --> 00:14:13,472
- Agent Brody? All right, follow me, please.
- Yep?

225
00:14:27,153 --> 00:14:29,405
At this point, I need to 
take all of your firearms.

226
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:32,032
- You're not taking my gun.
- Ma'am, I'm sorry. The rules ...

227
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:35,035
- It's okay, son, let her keep it.
- Yes, sir.

228
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:38,998
I'm General Paulson,
I'm leading the operation here.

229
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:40,499
- You're Brody?
- Yes.

230
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:43,419
I know you haven't been briefed on this,
but you guys will be assisting us ...

231
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:46,297
with investigative duties
under my command here.

232
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:47,506
So I'll show you to 
your offices and ...

233
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:49,383
No disrespect, sir, 
but outside martial law,

234
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:51,886
the military has no jurisdiction
on home soil.

235
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,888
Well, there's the 
Defense Authorization Act.

236
00:14:53,972 --> 00:14:56,307
The President has the authority
to use the armed forces ...

237
00:14:56,391 --> 00:15:00,102
to suppress any insurrection,
unlawful combination or conspiracy.

238
00:15:01,187 --> 00:15:02,855
This all went 
through Congress in '07.

239
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:05,316
Agent Helen! Good to see you again.

240
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,402
-General, nice to see you.
-Charlie. You all know each other?

241
00:15:08,486 --> 00:15:10,070
Yeah, we met earlier. 
A little mix-up.

242
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:12,197
What are you doing here?
Who are you guys?

243
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:14,408
- Independent contractors?
- What agency?

244
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:17,286
Oh, no agency would claim us.
Right, General?

245
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,038
Okay, everyone.
If you could follow me, please.

246
00:15:24,753 --> 00:15:25,961
Right in here, please.

247
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:31,342
Where are the rest of my people?

248
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:33,344
We're working with the staff 
we have here from this room.

249
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:37,097
Secure lines are being set up with all
field offices as well as other agencies.

250
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:38,223
What is this place?

251
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:41,185
Nowhere. It doesn't exist. 
Neither do we.

252
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:44,605
Hey, guys, I need you to see this.

253
00:15:48,652 --> 00:15:52,446
In the name of Allah the merciful,
and his prophet Muhammad,

254
00:15:53,406 --> 00:15:54,490
peace be upon him.

255
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,452
My name is Yusuf Atta Mohamed.

256
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:03,707
My former name is 
Steven Arthur Younger.

257
00:16:05,627 --> 00:16:06,961
This is Location One.

258
00:16:07,045 --> 00:16:10,297
We took a screen capture of all 
the locations, cleaned them up,

259
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:13,384
took him out and 
then took that thing out.

260
00:16:13,468 --> 00:16:17,054
Some of you will recognize this.

261
00:16:19,015 --> 00:16:20,474
It is a bomb.

262
00:16:20,558 --> 00:16:22,226
You've seen this?

263
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:31,443
I've placed three bombs
in three American cities.

264
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:37,408
All three are identical,
all three are in urban areas,

265
00:16:38,743 --> 00:16:40,244
and all three ...

266
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:45,207
are nuclear bombs.

267
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:47,209
Jesus.

268
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:50,754
I have demands 
which will be met by you,

269
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,966
or these bombs will explode.

270
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,221
I will give you these demands

271
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:02,641
at a later date.

272
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,479
This is Location Two.

273
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:13,318
This is Location Three.

274
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:21,326
All three bombs 
are set to explode ...

275
00:17:22,162 --> 00:17:26,999
on Friday the 21st, 
at noon Pacific Time.

276
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,044
Jesus. That's only 
four days from now.

277
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:35,424
The fissionabIe material is 
shielded effectively in lead and water ...

278
00:17:35,508 --> 00:17:38,802
You can check the tech details 
later if you want.

279
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:43,265
People, if there's a one percent 
chance the threat is serious,

280
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:44,558
this is a 100%.

281
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:47,561
How could an individual
manufacture nuclear weapons?

282
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:51,857
He's one of us. A specialist.
Career military, Delta Force.

283
00:17:51,941 --> 00:17:55,027
Expert in explosives, bomb disposal,

284
00:17:55,153 --> 00:17:58,238
specialized in field nuclear weapons.

285
00:17:58,323 --> 00:18:02,242
Served in Iraq to check out nukes.
He knows what he's doing.

286
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:04,119
He's 100% American.

287
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:07,414
When he was a teenager, his father 
moved the family to Islamabad

288
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:09,083
to work at the embassy there.

289
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,126
He's fluent in Farsi and Arabic.

290
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:14,755
Do we know if there's a way he could
get his hands on fissionable material?

291
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:19,134
Three years ago, he was on a team
checking nuclear facilities in Russia.

292
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:22,679
The Russians can't
account for 15 to 18 pounds.

293
00:18:22,764 --> 00:18:26,475
They can't be accurate.
Around five pounds on each bomb.

294
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,686
That's six to 
ten million casualties, folks.

295
00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:34,108
But do we have any direct 
evidence that this is real?

296
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:38,570
Tehran paid him 20 million to get nuclear 
materials out of Russia and into Iran.

297
00:18:38,655 --> 00:18:40,948
Then they lost 
track of him and the money.

298
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:42,116
How do you know that?

299
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,575
They told us themselves.

300
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,453
They didn't want us using Younger as an 
excuse to bomb the crap out of them.

301
00:18:46,538 --> 00:18:48,163
What does he want? 
Why is he doing this?

302
00:18:48,248 --> 00:18:52,084
We don't know. So far, he's made 
no demands, no further contact.

303
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:55,254
So we have 72 hours to figure 
out where he's hiding.

304
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:58,590
The focus of your investigation isn't
going to be about Younger's whereabouts.

305
00:18:58,675 --> 00:19:02,928
It's about the location of those three 
bombs. That is your immediate priority.

306
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:05,013
But surely, if we find him,
we'll find the bombs.

307
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:07,432
Not necessarily, Agent Helen.

308
00:19:10,645 --> 00:19:13,438
You already have him, 
don't you, General?

309
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:18,277
He was arrested 24 hours ago?
Why didn't you come out and tell us?

310
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:21,280
You didn't have clearance. It's 
classified through military intelligence.

311
00:19:21,364 --> 00:19:23,824
"Military intelligence." 
The great oxymoron.

312
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:24,950
How was he caught?

313
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:27,995
A security officer saw him 
in a mall in Phoenix.

314
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,583
His picture is plastered all over 
the country and he goes to a mall?

315
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:36,253
People, this is Colonel Kerkmejian.
He'll escort you to view the prisoner.

316
00:19:36,337 --> 00:19:38,338
You're allowed 
to observe and that's it.

317
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:41,425
General, when can we 
interrogate this man?

318
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:44,094
At the moment, the military is 
in charge of any interrogation.

319
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:46,597
If that changes, 
we'll let you know.

320
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:48,473
Colonel, if you would.

321
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:50,601
- This way, please.
- Please.

322
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:06,533
We have experts from multiple agencies,
the military, nuke specialists, psychologists,

323
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:09,119
analyzing every word and movement
he makes.

324
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:10,829
Who authorized this?

325
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:13,624
Everything here
is within operational parameters.

326
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,708
We never strike him.

327
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:19,546
Hot, cold, sleep deprivation, intense 
noise, bright lights, threats of violence.

328
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:21,381
He must be terrified.

329
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:24,343
Where are the dogs? 
There should be dogs.

330
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:27,471
It's the amateur hour here, Charlie.
This is never gonna work.

331
00:20:27,555 --> 00:20:30,557
Yeah, well,
you're gonna have to make it work.

332
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,730
You want to get in there 
and talk to him?

333
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:39,650
Yes. But I don't 
need your help to do that.

334
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:41,818
Believe me, you will.

335
00:20:52,997 --> 00:20:55,040
Tell me he's not here.

336
00:21:08,513 --> 00:21:09,513
What's he doing?

337
00:21:11,015 --> 00:21:13,100
Oh, shit, here we go.

338
00:21:18,022 --> 00:21:19,523
What the hell?

339
00:21:22,568 --> 00:21:26,029
No. No way, you fucking animal.
You keep away from him.

340
00:21:28,116 --> 00:21:29,741
- Hello.
- Back the fuck ...

341
00:21:30,868 --> 00:21:31,910
Get in there now!

342
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:43,088
I never laid a hand on the prisoner.

343
00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:45,882
Don't hurt him! 
You'll need him later.

344
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,430
I'm going in now, Colonel.

345
00:21:51,514 --> 00:21:53,724
What? No, you don't 
have authorization.

346
00:21:53,808 --> 00:21:55,475
Do you intend to obstruct the FBI?

347
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,145
Where the hell is Paulson?
And get him out of here!

348
00:22:07,155 --> 00:22:08,280
Shit.

349
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:12,743
Mr. Younger, 
I'm Special Agent Brody, FBI.

350
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,911
Your situation here is illegal.

351
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:18,248
And I'm going to get you out of here,
so you and I can sit down and talk.

352
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:22,627
I think you'll find that this is 
entirely legal. And necessary.

353
00:22:23,671 --> 00:22:25,005
Necessary?

354
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:27,007
In the War on Terror.

355
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:30,093
The FBI woman, 
she's in the cell alone.

356
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:34,431
Thank you. Could you please dry 
my arms? They're really cold.

357
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:41,355
You looked at my watch.
Would you like to know the time?

358
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:43,440
10:15 in the morning.

359
00:22:47,528 --> 00:22:49,529
Mr. Younger,

360
00:22:49,614 --> 00:22:51,865
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

361
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:53,909
About your wife Jehan
and your two children.

362
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:56,620
What do you want to know?

363
00:22:56,704 --> 00:22:59,915
You must have been very upset
when she left you.

364
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:04,336
I'm not upset. I accept my fate.

365
00:23:05,713 --> 00:23:07,589
You should accept yours.

366
00:23:07,673 --> 00:23:10,217
- Why are you doing this, Mr. Younger?
- Yusuf. My name is Yusuf.

367
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:11,968
All right, Yusuf.

368
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:15,722
They're gonna ask me about this ...

369
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:18,809
and I would really like to be
able to tell them something.

370
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:24,189
I'm sorry, nice lady. 
It's too soon.

371
00:23:27,902 --> 00:23:29,820
Get her out of here.

372
00:23:31,364 --> 00:23:33,323
Ma'am. Ma'am.

373
00:23:35,827 --> 00:23:39,830
And you, soldier,
get some goddamn results!

374
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:47,546
That's what I'm asking you.

375
00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:49,548
Call me back.

376
00:23:50,258 --> 00:23:53,760
You saw what's going on in there?
It's arguably illegal and ineffective.

377
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:56,138
Any information he gives
is probably unreliable.

378
00:23:56,222 --> 00:23:57,681
If we work with these people, 
our integrity ...
379
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,521
At the moment, 
they have official sanction.

379
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:02,352
Jack, I can't believe that.

380
00:24:02,437 --> 00:24:06,231
What about the General Counsel memo on
coercive interrogations? There's no way ...

381
00:24:06,315 --> 00:24:09,776
Look, the Director's Office 
has ordered us ...

382
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:11,903
to assist the military 
wherever possible.

383
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:16,783
For now, we observe and run our 
investigation simultaneously.

384
00:24:16,868 --> 00:24:19,911
Just keep me informed, okay?

385
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:26,460
We have the guy but we can't 
say so. Why the hell not?

386
00:24:26,544 --> 00:24:28,462
Because officially, 
he doesn't exist.

387
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:29,921
His face is all over the country!

388
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:31,131
And we keep it there.

389
00:24:31,215 --> 00:24:35,302
Faces lead to places. Our absolute 
priority is finding these locations.

390
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:38,138
Someone must know where they are,
and it's likely to be friends or family.

391
00:24:38,222 --> 00:24:40,265
Why can't we interrogate this guy?

392
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:42,309
We are currently negotiating that.

393
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,686
- Negotiating?
- Guys.

394
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,354
Please.

395
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:50,233
-D.J. , anything new on the ex-wife?
-Yeah, I just talked to the guys at LAX.

396
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:54,154
Two days ago, the wife and kids
tried to board a plane to Saudi Arabia,

397
00:24:54,238 --> 00:24:56,698
but were denied 
a visa at the last minute.

398
00:24:56,782 --> 00:24:58,408
They're likely still in the country.

399
00:24:58,493 --> 00:25:01,745
Phillips, I need you to coordinate 
a check with rental agencies.

400
00:25:01,829 --> 00:25:04,664
He must have transported the bombs
cross-country in some kind of truck.

401
00:25:04,749 --> 00:25:05,749
He wouldn't have used his real name.

402
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:08,668
Okay, I'll get local PDs out at 
port cities and border towns.

403
00:25:08,753 --> 00:25:12,172
Vince, get on to Frank and his team.

404
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:16,801
Organize a trace on his Internet, 
phone, credit cards, travel bookings.

405
00:25:16,886 --> 00:25:19,221
Get National Security Letters
for anyone who gives you a hard time.

406
00:25:19,305 --> 00:25:20,305
You got it.

407
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:23,225
Helen. Can I have a word with you?

408
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:26,811
We need you to negotiate. With H.

409
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:28,563
He's asking for you.

410
00:25:37,907 --> 00:25:42,160
I hear you're a specialist 
interrogator. Ex-Army?

411
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:43,828
Made me the man I am today.

412
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:47,332
Is that how you work with 
colleagues? You beat them?

413
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:50,919
He's a cheap sadist. Younger 
knows all about those techniques.

414
00:25:51,003 --> 00:25:52,879
He was trained by the Army
to withstand them.

415
00:25:52,964 --> 00:25:54,339
That stuff's not gonna work on him.

416
00:25:54,423 --> 00:25:57,759
What are the chances they'll use you
after that little show?

417
00:25:57,843 --> 00:25:59,344
You thought that was a show?

418
00:26:00,263 --> 00:26:02,639
You wanted the other interrogators
to look like the bad guys.

419
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:04,808
They are the bad guys.

420
00:26:05,977 --> 00:26:09,229
So, you talked to Younger.
Learn anything else about him?

421
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:11,982
A little. You?

422
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:13,984
Oh, no, that's his file there.

423
00:26:14,068 --> 00:26:16,278
This is yours.

424
00:26:18,447 --> 00:26:20,031
It's classified.

425
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:22,576
I see why they picked you, though.

426
00:26:22,827 --> 00:26:25,787
-Harvard Law, graduated with honors.
-Who gave that to you?

427
00:26:25,871 --> 00:26:28,957
Counter-terrorism. Good choice.
Let me see what else.

428
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:31,293
No boyfriends.

429
00:26:31,377 --> 00:26:34,588
And no children.
Chose a career over a family.

430
00:26:34,672 --> 00:26:37,007
Better watch that,
they gonna think you're a lesbian.

431
00:26:39,885 --> 00:26:43,722
So, you didn't get anything
out of him yet, huh? What a surprise.

432
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:46,516
Yeah, well, the General here
has a great deal for you.

433
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:50,520
The price is right but you can't 
beat up any more interrogators.

434
00:26:50,605 --> 00:26:51,605
I'm in charge.

435
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:55,609
You'll be brought in as we deem necessary,
take turns interrogating with the others.

436
00:26:55,693 --> 00:26:59,237
I work alone with an assistant and 
one other interrogator of my choice ...

437
00:26:59,322 --> 00:27:00,572
who takes over when I need a break.

438
00:27:00,656 --> 00:27:02,032
You don't call the shots here, I do.

439
00:27:02,116 --> 00:27:07,287
You want me to do my work,
you will treat me with respect.

440
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:09,789
Especially in front of a lady.

441
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:11,374
Look, we're all under 
a lot of pressure here.

442
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:14,169
- Why don't we just back off ...
- You're a grown man. Deal with it.

443
00:27:14,253 --> 00:27:16,504
Future of this country 
is in your hands.

444
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:20,300
Lose the committee, 
I lead with one other.

445
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,260
Who?

446
00:27:24,347 --> 00:27:25,388
Her.

447
00:27:25,931 --> 00:27:28,642
No way. She's part of a 
side investigation here,

448
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:30,894
she doesn't know the first thing
about military interrogation.

449
00:27:30,978 --> 00:27:33,647
- There's absolutely no ...
- Give him what he wants.

450
00:27:33,731 --> 00:27:36,232
And get him in there now, General.

451
00:27:38,361 --> 00:27:39,653
Why do you want me?

452
00:27:39,737 --> 00:27:41,988
You've got integrity, 
I like that.

453
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:46,451
And these people are dangerous.
I may need protection.

454
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:50,914
Do you have a plan?

455
00:27:50,998 --> 00:27:54,417
I shake him up, 
you shake him down, okay?

456
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:04,969
Outstanding!

457
00:28:05,262 --> 00:28:09,641
CIA Human Resources 
Training Manual, circa 1983.

458
00:28:09,725 --> 00:28:10,892
"The Honduran Edition," right?

459
00:28:10,976 --> 00:28:12,852
People, we have a 
new specialist joining us.

460
00:28:12,937 --> 00:28:16,314
From now on, there will be 
no observers. Everyone out, please.

461
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,110
Lubitchich, have you told him how small 
his penis is? They really hate that.

462
00:28:20,277 --> 00:28:22,946
All military personnel 
will leave at once.

463
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,532
The rest of you, consult 
with your agencies.

464
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:26,616
What the hell is happening?

465
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:28,910
I am. You're out.

466
00:28:31,997 --> 00:28:33,206
Is my equipment here yet?

467
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,667
Yeah, it's right over there,
and Alvarez is here.

468
00:28:35,751 --> 00:28:38,294
Hello, my friend. 
Wheel it right in.

469
00:28:42,341 --> 00:28:46,136
Can one of you guys get me
that fire ax over there, please?

470
00:28:48,347 --> 00:28:49,639
Fire ax, over there.

471
00:28:53,853 --> 00:28:56,896
Charlie, could you call my wife?
Ask her to bring my food down here, please.

472
00:28:56,981 --> 00:29:00,859
- She can't come in here, it's top secret.
- I need my wife here.

473
00:29:00,943 --> 00:29:03,027
And he's very particular 
about his food.

474
00:29:04,822 --> 00:29:07,532
- Thanks.
- Colonel Kerkmejian, you're in command.

475
00:29:07,616 --> 00:29:09,409
Me, sir? Aren't you?

476
00:29:12,246 --> 00:29:13,246
I'm doing it now.

477
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:17,333
Let's get him down.

478
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:21,379
So, how does this work?

479
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:22,922
I never know that.

480
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:25,175
And the really great thing is ...

481
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:26,801
he doesn't either.

482
00:29:37,354 --> 00:29:38,438
Agent Brody?

483
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:40,356
We're gonna need your eyes.

484
00:29:40,816 --> 00:29:44,319
Could you look for 
any interesting tics,

485
00:29:44,403 --> 00:29:47,071
eye movements, fear, jitters,

486
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:49,157
things like that, please?

487
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:53,203
Mr. Younger! My name is H.

488
00:29:53,287 --> 00:29:56,289
I'm going to be conducting your 
interrogation from here on out.

489
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:57,624
We've met.

490
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,752
That's right. 
Sorry you had to see that.

491
00:30:01,045 --> 00:30:05,173
And I want you to know,
my interest lies only with you.

492
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:10,553
Now, I have one question for you.
It's a simple one.

493
00:30:10,846 --> 00:30:15,141
PIease teII me
where you placed the three bombs.

494
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:17,352
This is not what we talked about.

495
00:30:17,436 --> 00:30:19,854
That's because you were only 
listening to yourself.

496
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:23,316
Start with the furthest 
location, please.

497
00:30:32,076 --> 00:30:33,535
Mr. Younger?

498
00:30:35,996 --> 00:30:38,456
You understand what 
I'm about to do to you?

499
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:44,671
Oh, my God!

500
00:30:52,471 --> 00:30:54,097
What? What? It's only a finger.

501
00:30:54,181 --> 00:30:57,141
What, not really a 
whole finger, it's ...

502
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:59,310
Tape him, then leave him.

503
00:30:59,395 --> 00:31:01,813
- Get him out!
- All right!

504
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:07,402
So that's your technique?
You're a fucking joke.

505
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:09,863
You expect me to be part of that?

506
00:31:09,947 --> 00:31:11,489
All right, all right, no more fingers.

507
00:31:11,574 --> 00:31:13,700
You think you're going back in there?

508
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:15,451
Well, why don't we ask the man?

509
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:19,956
He's got direct access, highest levels,
back door, no names, no records.

510
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:24,460
Well, tell me. 
Do I have authorization or not?

511
00:31:24,545 --> 00:31:26,796
Higher authority believes
that we should all do ...

512
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:31,050
what we think is best for our 
country and its people.

513
00:31:33,637 --> 00:31:34,804
Alvarez, bag him.

514
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:38,391
Colonel, would you 
lose the gorillas?

515
00:31:38,475 --> 00:31:40,560
- If I'm in charge here, I ...
- You're not.

516
00:31:40,644 --> 00:31:42,896
He is and we need to do something
about that.

517
00:31:43,856 --> 00:31:45,398
I won't authorize him to continue ...

518
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:49,152
So let it happen without your author-
ization. Then you're covered, right?

519
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,241
- One of my guys stays.
- Deal.

520
00:31:55,326 --> 00:31:58,411
We need to stop this at once. That 
man needs to be pulled out right now!

521
00:31:58,495 --> 00:32:00,788
You want to leave, that's fine.

522
00:32:06,003 --> 00:32:08,838
Lay everything out 
on this table, please.

523
00:32:25,773 --> 00:32:28,733
I haven't seen you 
since Afghanistan, right?

524
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:35,031
When you're done, 
you can wait outside.

525
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:53,967
Mr. Younger, 
are you ready for this?

526
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:56,761
No.

527
00:32:57,888 --> 00:32:59,597
No one ever is.

528
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:11,275
All your worst fears,

529
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,486
all your nightmares ...

530
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,405
are right here.

531
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:24,205
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

532
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:25,415
Get General Paulson 
here right now!

533
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:26,666
Colonel, the Geneva Convention
states that ...

534
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,627
The Military Commissions Act,
no unlawful enemy combatants ...

535
00:33:29,712 --> 00:33:30,962
may invoke the Geneva Convention.

536
00:33:31,046 --> 00:33:32,630
That act declares torture illegal.

537
00:33:32,715 --> 00:33:34,841
Unlawful combatants have no right
to habeas corpus.

538
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:36,759
They can't bring any claims to 
court, so how do they prove it?

539
00:33:36,844 --> 00:33:40,138
That's alien unlawful enemy combatants.
This man is an American citizen.

540
00:33:40,222 --> 00:33:43,266
That was revoked yesterday.
He's now stateless.

541
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:45,184
You can't do that.

542
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:48,312
Sir, General Paulson
can't come back right now.

543
00:33:48,397 --> 00:33:49,981
He says you're in charge, 
and carry on.

544
00:33:50,065 --> 00:33:51,357
- He says what?
- Carry on, sir.

545
00:33:51,442 --> 00:33:54,110
This is illegal. I will 
not allow this to happen!

546
00:33:55,612 --> 00:34:00,158
The plutonium pit consists of ...

547
00:34:00,242 --> 00:34:02,994
three canisters of plutonium E,

548
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,456
one and a half pounds.

549
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:10,293
Another one and half pounds,

550
00:34:12,421 --> 00:34:15,048
and another one and a half pounds.

551
00:34:16,258 --> 00:34:18,051
We have to stop this.

552
00:34:19,053 --> 00:34:20,845
Let me call you back.

553
00:34:21,263 --> 00:34:23,514
Can you shut the door, please?

554
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:28,895
What he's doing in there
is a violation of every ...

555
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:31,355
Did you interview the suspect again?

556
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,982
- No.
- Then why have you left the room?

557
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:36,986
Jack, the suspect is being tortured.
This is unconstitutional.

558
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:42,325
Helen, if those bombs go off,
there will be no fucking Constitution!

559
00:34:53,378 --> 00:34:56,380
Main Justice and the Director's Office
are aware of what's going on here,

560
00:34:56,465 --> 00:35:01,010
but we are powerless to stop it and 
the situation is too grave to pull out.

561
00:35:01,762 --> 00:35:04,680
When you're in there you act as 
a witness, and when this is over,

562
00:35:04,765 --> 00:35:08,476
we'll bring a civil rights 
prosecution against these bastards.

563
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,479
In the meantime,
you are Incident Commander.

564
00:35:12,397 --> 00:35:16,359
We need you to do everything in 
your power to find those bombs.

565
00:35:17,653 --> 00:35:19,362
Do you understand?

566
00:35:37,881 --> 00:35:39,382
You've removed your name tag.

567
00:36:10,914 --> 00:36:12,707
Do you mind if I ...

568
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:20,673
You all right?

569
00:36:22,384 --> 00:36:26,596
You know, it hits everybody like 
that at first. You get used to it.

570
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:31,225
You didn't even question him.

571
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:35,146
So this blood on my jacket would be 
all right if I'd gotten some information?

572
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,939
Well, you're not gonna get any.

573
00:36:37,024 --> 00:36:40,359
You do this and he'll say anything 
you want, and none of it will be true.

574
00:36:40,444 --> 00:36:43,237
Physical torture doesn't work.

575
00:36:43,322 --> 00:36:46,699
So, I guess that's 
why they've been using it

576
00:36:46,783 --> 00:36:49,660
since the beginning 
of human history, huh?

577
00:36:49,745 --> 00:36:50,745
For fun?

578
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:54,874
That's what makes you so special, is it?
Our secret weapon against the enemy?

579
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:59,462
It's not about the enemy. 
It's about us.

580
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,130
Our weakness.

581
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,384
We're on the losing side, Helen.

582
00:37:07,512 --> 00:37:09,555
We're afraid, they're not.

583
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:12,767
We doubt, they believe.

584
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:14,101
We have values.

585
00:37:14,186 --> 00:37:17,021
And our values have cost us
how many lives?

586
00:37:17,522 --> 00:37:20,942
It's not about that guy out there.
He's not the problem. You are.

587
00:37:21,026 --> 00:37:22,735
Whatever happened 
to rapport building?

588
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:25,321
Takes time, possibly months.

589
00:37:25,405 --> 00:37:29,033
Look, this is a process. He has 
to believe I have no limits.

590
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:31,911
- You're not even asking him questions.
- That's your job.

591
00:37:31,995 --> 00:37:32,954
Well, then, let me do it.

592
00:37:33,038 --> 00:37:34,247
- You want to work with me?
- No!

593
00:37:34,331 --> 00:37:37,667
How about working beside me? 
Take turns?

594
00:37:50,055 --> 00:37:51,347
Go ahead.

595
00:38:14,788 --> 00:38:16,872
Yusuf, he's not gonna stop.

596
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:23,337
Why are you letting him do this?

597
00:38:25,382 --> 00:38:27,967
We're gonna find these bombs anyway.

598
00:38:28,051 --> 00:38:32,054
You talk to me,
and maybe we can make it easy.

599
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:35,391
Otherwise that bastard 
is gonna keep at you.

600
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:37,476
It's okay.

601
00:38:38,854 --> 00:38:40,521
I'm all prepared.

602
00:38:43,317 --> 00:38:47,528
Your friends at the mosque. 
Your family.

603
00:38:49,156 --> 00:38:50,906
Did you want to impress 
them with this?

604
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:53,701
Your wife?

605
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:56,287
Your kids?

606
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:01,208
Oh, my God.

607
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,544
Your kids.

608
00:39:04,087 --> 00:39:06,005
Nobody told you, did they?

609
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:08,716
Your wife tried to 
leave the country,

610
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:10,801
go to Saudi Arabia,

611
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,220
but she was denied a visa.

612
00:39:13,305 --> 00:39:15,556
They could be hiding anywhere.

613
00:39:16,016 --> 00:39:18,601
You don't want 
them blown to pieces.

614
00:39:19,311 --> 00:39:21,937
Yusuf. Yusuf, you love them.

615
00:39:23,398 --> 00:39:25,649
You must love them so much.

616
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,113
You have two days 
to agree to my demands.

617
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:34,033
God damn it,
you haven't made any demands.

618
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:37,328
Don't swear. God hears you.
He sees everything.

619
00:39:37,412 --> 00:39:38,788
He sees you.

620
00:39:39,247 --> 00:39:41,707
Allah loves those 
that do good, not evil.

621
00:39:43,043 --> 00:39:45,211
I read the Koran. I admire it.

622
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:47,713
Allah blesses a just war.

623
00:39:47,798 --> 00:39:51,258
Give me one of the bombs. Just one 
of the bombs. Just give me proof.

624
00:39:51,343 --> 00:39:53,010
Then they'll listen to you,
they'll know you're serious.

625
00:39:53,095 --> 00:39:54,428
Tomorrow.

626
00:39:55,138 --> 00:39:56,680
They'll listen tomorrow.

627
00:39:56,765 --> 00:39:58,349
What happens tomorrow?
The deadline is Friday.

628
00:39:58,433 --> 00:39:59,433
- Time's up.
- Wait!

629
00:39:59,518 --> 00:40:02,228
What happens tomorrow? 
Tell me, please!

630
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:04,688
Help me to help you, okay?

631
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:06,732
I don't need your help.

632
00:40:06,817 --> 00:40:09,568
I can take it. I deserve it.

633
00:40:09,653 --> 00:40:12,488
- You can stay if you want.
- What happens tomorrow?

634
00:40:12,656 --> 00:40:13,656
Hit him.

635
00:40:48,525 --> 00:40:50,985
Would you like me to kill you now?

636
00:40:52,237 --> 00:40:54,488
Do what you have to.

637
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,199
I can't lose.

638
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:05,332
You're practical.

639
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:09,795
You're a relativist, 
a consequentialist.

640
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,714
You know what I mean?

641
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:15,468
Nah, of course you don't.

642
00:41:15,552 --> 00:41:18,512
You only read religious books.

643
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:25,561
What I'm doing here 
is good for my people

644
00:41:26,062 --> 00:41:29,732
if I get results, if I save them.

645
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,901
You see,

646
00:41:32,777 --> 00:41:36,739
there is no H. and Younger.

647
00:41:36,823 --> 00:41:38,991
There's only victory and defeat.

648
00:41:39,075 --> 00:41:41,494
The winner gets to take
the moral high ground ...

649
00:41:41,578 --> 00:41:44,413
because they get to 
write the history books.

650
00:41:44,498 --> 00:41:47,500
The loser just loses.

651
00:41:50,212 --> 00:41:52,755
The only miscalculation 
in your plan ...

652
00:41:53,632 --> 00:41:54,965
was me.

653
00:41:56,593 --> 00:42:01,555
You see, I will tear your eyes out,
but you'll not tear my building down.

654
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:07,520
Every man, no matter how strong he is,
lies to himself about something.

655
00:42:08,522 --> 00:42:11,065
I will find your lie ...

656
00:42:11,149 --> 00:42:12,483
and I will break you.

657
00:42:14,569 --> 00:42:16,320
You'll be a hero.

658
00:43:29,561 --> 00:43:30,644
Yes?

659
00:43:32,522 --> 00:43:33,689
Good.

660
00:43:34,649 --> 00:43:35,941
His wife is here.

661
00:43:36,026 --> 00:43:37,651
About time.

662
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:39,945
H., Rina's here.

663
00:43:50,874 --> 00:43:52,124
Alvarez.

664
00:43:53,585 --> 00:43:56,337
Dim the lights, take an hour break.

665
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:00,633
Okay, Colonel?

666
00:44:01,176 --> 00:44:03,719
Tell your wife nothing. 
You understand?

667
00:44:03,803 --> 00:44:06,388
- I'm going in.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

668
00:44:08,308 --> 00:44:09,933
Wait ten minutes.

669
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:13,562
When the adrenaline wears off
he'll start to weep.

670
00:44:13,647 --> 00:44:16,815
Then you can talk to him. 
Not before.

671
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:19,401
If he's asleep, zap him.

672
00:44:19,986 --> 00:44:22,404
Just press this green button,
send a little shock through him ...

673
00:44:22,489 --> 00:44:24,323
and it'll wake him up, okay?

674
00:44:24,407 --> 00:44:26,617
But only you can press the button.

675
00:44:26,701 --> 00:44:28,077
You got that? Just her.

676
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:29,495
I'm not gonna do it.

677
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,497
Well, then you stay here.

678
00:44:31,581 --> 00:44:33,791
You can't run away from this.

679
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:36,251
Run away?

680
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,214
Some of us don't 
have that option, Helen.

681
00:44:40,298 --> 00:44:45,010
I got nowhere to run.
I'm a prisoner here myself.

682
00:44:45,095 --> 00:44:46,929
Ask the CIA.

683
00:44:48,431 --> 00:44:49,682
Ask them.

684
00:44:56,022 --> 00:44:58,190
What the hell is that about?

685
00:44:58,274 --> 00:45:01,360
He's done some bad things.
People out there are looking for him.

686
00:45:01,444 --> 00:45:03,028
They want payback.

687
00:45:03,113 --> 00:45:06,824
So he's done this many times 
before. Does it ever work?

688
00:45:08,284 --> 00:45:10,244
You've become one of us.

689
00:45:10,328 --> 00:45:13,580
"That's terrible," we say, 
"but does it work?"

690
00:45:26,803 --> 00:45:29,638
You haven't been sleeping, 
you poor thing.

691
00:45:35,478 --> 00:45:36,812
- He's fallen asleep.
- What?

692
00:45:36,896 --> 00:45:39,148
- He's asleep.
- We need H. back in here.

693
00:45:39,232 --> 00:45:41,734
Brody, push the damn button.
The bastard's not supposed to sleep!

694
00:45:41,818 --> 00:45:43,235
- You heard H.
- I'll do it.

695
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:44,653
Don't, don't do it.

696
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:48,240
That's enough. Turn it off.

697
00:45:48,324 --> 00:45:51,034
- Turn it off! For God's sake!
- I can't!

698
00:45:52,203 --> 00:45:54,163
My God, it's killing him!

699
00:45:56,082 --> 00:45:59,001
- Where is it? Where the fuck is it?
- Fuck!

700
00:46:13,892 --> 00:46:16,310
That's beautiful, Katie May.
Did you make that for me?

701
00:46:16,394 --> 00:46:18,145
I did it at school.

702
00:46:21,775 --> 00:46:23,192
You bastard.

703
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,610
You mind?

704
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:28,572
Kids, Daddy's got to go.
But I'll be home soon, okay?

705
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,365
Bye-bye, Daddy.

706
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,326
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

707
00:46:34,454 --> 00:46:36,622
Current ran for 15 seconds, 
he'll be fine.

708
00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:37,706
You nearly killed him.

709
00:46:37,791 --> 00:46:40,501
And you all tried 
to save him, right?

710
00:46:40,585 --> 00:46:42,878
I wanted him to see that.
He needs to feel hope.

711
00:46:42,962 --> 00:46:46,298
- You gonna find these fucking bombs?
- Nope, that's your job.

712
00:46:46,382 --> 00:46:49,259
Special Agent Brody, 
this is my wife, Rina.

713
00:46:52,472 --> 00:46:55,766
- Got to go, doll. Duty calls.
- Okay, love. Good-bye.

714
00:47:01,564 --> 00:47:03,649
You know. You know what he does.

715
00:47:03,733 --> 00:47:04,817
Of course.

716
00:47:04,901 --> 00:47:07,945
How can you? Your family, 
your children.

717
00:47:08,029 --> 00:47:11,406
You live in the same house 
with him. He's not normal.

718
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:12,908
Normal?

719
00:47:13,785 --> 00:47:15,994
Let me tell you something.

720
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,206
I lost my first family in Bosnia.

721
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,124
Three men come to my house.

722
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,671
They rape me in front of my family,
then kill everyone.

723
00:47:25,755 --> 00:47:28,257
My little boy, they kill last.

724
00:47:29,425 --> 00:47:31,176
These were my neighbors,

725
00:47:31,261 --> 00:47:32,845
they knew me.

726
00:47:32,929 --> 00:47:34,930
Very normal men.

727
00:47:51,865 --> 00:47:55,409
We got him in Yemen, Pakistan, Russia,
all over. He used several passports.

728
00:47:55,493 --> 00:47:58,370
Okay, but did they put him and the 
nuclear material together at any time?

729
00:47:58,454 --> 00:48:01,123
It's only circumstantial. The Russians
don't know exactly how much ...

730
00:48:01,207 --> 00:48:05,127
If he did have 15, 18 pounds of it,
how did he transport it internationally?

731
00:48:05,211 --> 00:48:06,211
He had lots of money.

732
00:48:06,296 --> 00:48:08,797
Once it's properly sealed,
it's not that hard to move.

733
00:48:08,882 --> 00:48:10,382
Anything new on the ex-wife?

734
00:48:10,466 --> 00:48:13,051
Yeah, we tracked her to Oregon.
She used an ATM in Eugene.

735
00:48:13,136 --> 00:48:15,470
Local PD's hardcore on 
all motels and B and Bs.

736
00:48:15,555 --> 00:48:16,722
We'll get her 
within the next 12 hours.

737
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:19,266
Vince, Younger was arrested 
in a mall. There must be a tape.

738
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:22,561
The Military Intel has it. They're working 
out whether we're allowed to see it.

739
00:48:22,645 --> 00:48:24,771
- Oh, Jesus.
- Boss, check it out.

740
00:48:24,856 --> 00:48:27,900
I got a Hertz employee in Jersey
who ID'd him. It's a definite ID.

741
00:48:27,984 --> 00:48:29,943
He rented a two-ton truck,
he never returned it.

742
00:48:30,028 --> 00:48:31,486
Great. Trace its movements.

743
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:34,156
Put a want on it to all law 
enforcement agencies in major cities.

744
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,283
Find someone who's seen that truck.

745
00:48:38,786 --> 00:48:41,914
Okay, he was arrested here.
That means he went cross-country.

746
00:48:41,998 --> 00:48:44,416
Three bombs. One East Coast.
Got to be Manhattan.

747
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,086
One West Coast. Probably LA.
Jesus, we're right in the blast zone.

748
00:48:48,171 --> 00:48:51,757
Okay, third one, somewhere in 
the middle. Maybe Chicago.

749
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:52,799
Texas?

750
00:48:52,884 --> 00:48:55,636
- Okay, focus on these locations first.
- Doing it now.

751
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,263
Hey, Brody, H. wants you.

752
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:08,357
Tell him I'm here.

753
00:49:08,816 --> 00:49:10,400
He can come out.

754
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:14,029
H., she'd like you to come out.

755
00:49:16,324 --> 00:49:18,659
Helen, could you come in here?

756
00:49:20,203 --> 00:49:21,411
Please?

757
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:26,833
Just here.

758
00:49:30,213 --> 00:49:31,380
Sorry.

759
00:49:32,966 --> 00:49:34,883
Yusuf, it's Thursday.

760
00:49:36,094 --> 00:49:38,261
What will happen today?

761
00:49:38,346 --> 00:49:40,097
Look at her, Yusuf.

762
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:48,188
You know anything about massage?
It would be very helpful.

763
00:49:49,357 --> 00:49:51,984
What? No, not for me, for him.

764
00:49:52,068 --> 00:49:56,613
His neck is in spasm 
and he needs a break.

765
00:49:56,698 --> 00:49:57,906
Please.

766
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,752
Mind if I play some music?

767
00:50:20,013 --> 00:50:22,431
Like one of these? Keep you going.

768
00:50:25,768 --> 00:50:27,769
Just in case, for later.

769
00:50:30,231 --> 00:50:32,607
Go as deep as you can,
he's blocking the pain,

770
00:50:32,692 --> 00:50:34,401
I don't want him to 
lose sensation right ...

771
00:50:34,485 --> 00:50:36,319
No, don't stop.

772
00:50:46,748 --> 00:50:49,416
Some subjects can take it 
from a male.

773
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,710
Female?

774
00:50:52,712 --> 00:50:54,755
Breaks them right down.

775
00:50:55,506 --> 00:50:58,050
I had a nurse who used to assist me.

776
00:50:58,801 --> 00:51:01,178
She was very good.

777
00:51:01,262 --> 00:51:03,138
It's why I married her.

778
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,892
Did Rina tell you
what happened to her family?

779
00:51:07,643 --> 00:51:09,644
Yeah, of course she did.

780
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:14,608
She tells complete strangers 
sometimes. It's embarrassing.

781
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,653
Did she tell you 
the end of the story?

782
00:51:18,738 --> 00:51:21,490
What happened when they 
took the village back ...

783
00:51:21,574 --> 00:51:23,700
and captured the three men?

784
00:51:24,494 --> 00:51:27,829
She killed their wives and kids
in front of them.

785
00:51:28,873 --> 00:51:31,958
And just as our troops arrived,
she killed those three men.

786
00:51:33,669 --> 00:51:36,755
They arrested her, 
handed her over to me.

787
00:51:40,343 --> 00:51:45,180
Did I tell you our children
were born prematurely, Helen?

788
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,141
We were so worried.

789
00:51:48,851 --> 00:51:52,270
Childbirth was the most 
beautiful thing.

790
00:51:54,857 --> 00:51:59,277
When the tops of their 
heads start to crown,

791
00:51:59,362 --> 00:52:02,072
it's almost as if 
God actually exists.

792
00:52:05,701 --> 00:52:07,494
How about you, Yusuf?

793
00:52:08,538 --> 00:52:11,206
Where you there
when your wife gave birth to Ali?

794
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:15,377
How about Samura?

795
00:52:15,461 --> 00:52:19,798
Agent Brody here would say yes
because she thinks you're a good father.

796
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:25,679
Me? I don't think you were
anywhere near that hospital.

797
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:33,103
Yes.

798
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:36,606
Yes! That's what I want to see.

799
00:52:38,317 --> 00:52:40,652
No, don't! H., don't! Stop!

800
00:52:40,736 --> 00:52:41,778
Stop him, please!

801
00:52:41,863 --> 00:52:44,990
I can stop him, but you have to 
talk to me. Tell me something!

802
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:48,243
Okay! I'll talk, I'll talk! 
I'll talk! I'll ...

803
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,922
I am now willing ...

804
00:53:04,886 --> 00:53:07,554
to make a statement of my terms.

805
00:53:11,434 --> 00:53:13,518
This is a waste of time.

806
00:53:13,603 --> 00:53:16,855
Put him in front of a camera, he 
gets a break, that's what he needs.

807
00:53:16,939 --> 00:53:19,733
Now make us an offer,
we'll consider it. More time.

808
00:53:19,817 --> 00:53:22,360
If he talks at all, 
that's progress.

809
00:53:22,445 --> 00:53:23,862
And we don't make deals 
with terrorists.

810
00:53:23,946 --> 00:53:27,073
Oh, please, we do it all the time.

811
00:53:27,158 --> 00:53:29,326
He'll say he's been tortured, 
we'll deny it.

812
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:31,578
He'll say he wants a broadcast,
we'll refuse it.

813
00:53:31,662 --> 00:53:35,457
He'll make crazy demands, and we'll 
reject it. What's the goddamn point?

814
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:36,875
Sir, we're recording.

815
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,921
Mr. President,

816
00:53:43,633 --> 00:53:47,761
I am currently being held
on charges of terrorism.

817
00:53:52,308 --> 00:53:56,228
I am a Muslim and a loyal American.

818
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,814
I love my wife.

819
00:54:05,154 --> 00:54:06,696
I love my kids.

820
00:54:08,741 --> 00:54:10,450
I love my country.

821
00:54:12,078 --> 00:54:16,414
Since my capture, 
I have been treated well

822
00:54:16,499 --> 00:54:21,002
by the honorable men and women
of our armed forces and police.

823
00:54:21,087 --> 00:54:22,254
He's stalling.

824
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:26,633
I do not require you
to broadcast this statement.

825
00:54:26,717 --> 00:54:29,552
That would set a dangerous precedent.

826
00:54:30,429 --> 00:54:34,099
I've placed three bombs
in three American cities.

827
00:54:35,226 --> 00:54:37,978
I wiII reveal their Iocations ...

828
00:54:38,062 --> 00:54:41,189
when you make the following 
public announcements.

829
00:54:42,149 --> 00:54:43,942
First,

830
00:54:44,193 --> 00:54:48,989
no further financial or 
military support will be given ...

831
00:54:49,073 --> 00:54:53,576
to puppet regimes and dictatorships
in any Islamic nations.

832
00:54:55,371 --> 00:54:56,579
Second,

833
00:54:57,373 --> 00:55:02,711
that all U.S. forces will be with-
drawn from all Islamic countries.

834
00:55:04,505 --> 00:55:08,967
I am willing to accept a reasonable 
timeframe for these demands.

835
00:55:10,386 --> 00:55:13,555
Mr. President, I know you want 
to bring our men and women home ...

836
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:15,515
to the nation we love.

837
00:55:19,228 --> 00:55:21,187
Thank you ...

838
00:55:21,272 --> 00:55:23,773
and Allah bless America.

839
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:33,992
Some kind of fucking joke.

840
00:55:34,076 --> 00:55:36,661
What if we persuade him that we're 
willing to work toward his objectives?

841
00:55:36,746 --> 00:55:38,330
We could get the 
locations of the bombs.

842
00:55:38,414 --> 00:55:42,500
And allow a lone terrorist
to dictate U.S. foreign policy?

843
00:55:42,585 --> 00:55:46,087
He didn't ask for a broadcast. He didn't 
ask us to show it to the public.

844
00:55:46,172 --> 00:55:47,339
He just wants to negotiate.

845
00:55:47,423 --> 00:55:49,507
Oh, negotiate. 
Are you out of your mind?

846
00:55:49,592 --> 00:55:53,178
If we release this to the public, he knows
that we could never make a deal with him.

847
00:55:53,262 --> 00:55:56,723
- He just wants to negotiate.
- Just take the deal!

848
00:55:57,308 --> 00:55:59,517
His requests are reasonable, achievable,

849
00:55:59,602 --> 00:56:01,561
and I believe the American people
would go along with them.

850
00:56:01,645 --> 00:56:04,272
Which is why you can be damn sure
they won't ever get to hear them.

851
00:56:04,357 --> 00:56:06,775
Well, maybe they should.
What are you afraid of?

852
00:56:06,859 --> 00:56:09,944
He didn't ask us to do anything. He 
just asked the President to announce it.

853
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:11,613
Might save a few million people.

854
00:56:11,697 --> 00:56:14,282
We've got 21 hours left.
We're running out of time.

855
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:16,201
It's what he wants.

856
00:56:16,285 --> 00:56:19,621
And he's gathering his strength.
Bargaining for time.

857
00:56:19,705 --> 00:56:21,623
If you don't cut this deal,

858
00:56:21,707 --> 00:56:24,250
I may have to crank this 
up a notch or two.

859
00:56:24,335 --> 00:56:28,630
To what? What's a notch or two
beyond what you're already doing?

860
00:56:29,799 --> 00:56:32,384
What are you getting 
by torturing him?

861
00:56:32,468 --> 00:56:35,595
He's given us nothing.
We've played right into his hands.

862
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:37,722
Someone's gonna have 
to make a call here.

863
00:56:37,807 --> 00:56:39,766
The call is this,

864
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:42,268
I'm not phoning upstairs to tell 
the President he has to change

865
00:56:42,353 --> 00:56:46,815
a century's worth of Middle East policy
because some asshole made a video.

866
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:50,819
You haven't even figured out
if the bombs are real!

867
00:56:51,195 --> 00:56:52,529
Okay then.

868
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:55,490
Pending further developments,
we can assume ...

869
00:56:55,574 --> 00:56:58,076
that the current open protocols
of interrogation continue ...

870
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,620
until otherwise directed 
by higher authority.

871
00:57:00,704 --> 00:57:04,624
So, in other words,
you want me to go on my way ...

872
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:08,128
without telling me to go on my way?

873
00:57:17,888 --> 00:57:22,434
Yusuf, you could make a deal.
You've got these guys cold.

874
00:57:22,518 --> 00:57:25,937
They can't take you to court, they can't
prosecute a man with no fingernails.

875
00:57:26,021 --> 00:57:28,606
Give us your accomplices,
tell us where the bombs are,

876
00:57:28,691 --> 00:57:30,608
we put you on a flight to Pakistan.

877
00:57:30,693 --> 00:57:33,027
- With my kids?
- They'll negotiate.

878
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:36,281
No one outside knows 
this ever happened.

879
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:39,909
Give us the bombs 
and you could be free.

880
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:42,036
He doesn't want to be free.

881
00:57:42,121 --> 00:57:43,621
Everyone wants to be free.

882
00:57:43,706 --> 00:57:47,083
An assumption the U.S. has 
screwed up all over the world.

883
00:57:47,168 --> 00:57:50,795
What you call freedom 
is a false God.

884
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,214
See? Like minds.

885
00:57:53,299 --> 00:57:55,216
Don't you get it, Brody?

886
00:57:55,301 --> 00:57:57,594
He placed himself here.

887
00:57:57,678 --> 00:57:59,804
He knew what we'd do to him.

888
00:58:00,264 --> 00:58:03,558
Yusuf, tell me where the bombs are.

889
00:58:03,642 --> 00:58:04,934
Make the deal.

890
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:07,520
The bombs ...

891
00:58:07,605 --> 00:58:11,024
will explode if 
my terms are not met.

892
00:58:11,108 --> 00:58:13,318
But they will be.

893
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:17,155
No other choice. You have 
to tell them that, Brody.

894
00:58:19,909 --> 00:58:22,327
You really don't want 
to be here for this.

895
00:58:35,633 --> 00:58:37,425
How long does he stand there?

896
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:38,760
23 minutes.

897
00:58:38,844 --> 00:58:41,137
Security told the cops,
they came in and got him.

898
00:58:41,222 --> 00:58:42,555
Speed it up, can you?

899
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:47,602
Zoom in.

900
00:58:48,145 --> 00:58:51,523
He walks in, he stands directly 
in front of a security camera,

901
00:58:51,607 --> 00:58:54,317
and he stays there for 23 minutes
until he gets caught?

902
00:58:54,401 --> 00:58:57,153
Same day he sent in the tape.
He wanted to get caught.

903
00:58:57,238 --> 00:59:01,449
He let himself get captured even 
though he knew we could torture him.

904
00:59:01,784 --> 00:59:03,159
He was prepared for it.

905
00:59:03,244 --> 00:59:05,954
"I'm all prepared," 
that's what he said.

906
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:08,790
Goddamn it!

907
00:59:08,874 --> 00:59:11,376
He's making monkeys 
out of us, people.

908
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:15,755
He rented a truck. That's loose 
circumstantial evidence at best.

909
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,509
We have no direct evidence that 
he even possesses nuclear material.

910
00:59:19,593 --> 00:59:21,469
Except a video with three bombs on it.

911
00:59:21,554 --> 00:59:23,555
And he knows how to make those bombs
look just right, doesn't he?

912
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:27,767
He had the time, the means, the 
capability, the finance, the contacts.

913
00:59:27,851 --> 00:59:29,227
There's the Iranian connection.

914
00:59:29,311 --> 00:59:34,274
Some asshole waves a toy gun in the 
air and forces the cops to shoot him.

915
00:59:34,358 --> 00:59:37,860
Suicide by police.
How about torture by government?

916
00:59:37,945 --> 00:59:40,488
You're saying he wanted to get 
captured so we could torture him?

917
00:59:40,573 --> 00:59:41,573
Just to make a point.

918
00:59:41,657 --> 00:59:43,408
Well, what if it is a hoax?

919
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:47,328
He could ask for anything and 
we'd have no way of finding out.

920
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:51,833
Brody, you better 
get back in there. Now.

921
01:00:03,512 --> 01:00:05,430
You can leave him.

922
01:00:05,514 --> 01:00:07,849
I've been ordered to take over.

923
01:00:09,184 --> 01:00:10,685
Okay, Alvarez.

924
01:00:20,195 --> 01:00:21,779
He's all yours.

925
01:00:32,666 --> 01:00:34,334
We know, Yusuf.

926
01:00:36,712 --> 01:00:38,713
We know about the bombs.

927
01:00:39,715 --> 01:00:42,383
You're very skillful.

928
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:45,595
You can fake a nuke 
in a video, right?

929
01:00:47,222 --> 01:00:49,599
- The bombs are real.
- All right.

930
01:00:49,683 --> 01:00:52,143
Then give me one.

931
01:00:52,227 --> 01:00:54,062
Come on, prove it.

932
01:00:55,064 --> 01:00:56,689
Just give me one.

933
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:01,319
You don't want me to give you proof.

934
01:01:01,403 --> 01:01:03,404
Nobody believes you, Yusuf.

935
01:01:04,114 --> 01:01:08,660
They're only doing this crap
because they want your accomplices.

936
01:01:08,744 --> 01:01:10,912
- What's she doing?
- But I don't even think they exist.

937
01:01:11,038 --> 01:01:11,996
You'll see.

938
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:14,040
Don't ask me for proof.

939
01:01:14,124 --> 01:01:18,252
We need it in order to believe
the bombs are real.

940
01:01:20,756 --> 01:01:23,091
They'll give you what you want.

941
01:01:24,176 --> 01:01:26,260
You'll be such a hero.

942
01:01:31,475 --> 01:01:33,434
Your wife will come back,

943
01:01:34,436 --> 01:01:35,895
your children will love you.

944
01:01:38,691 --> 01:01:41,693
You let yourself be captured.

945
01:01:41,777 --> 01:01:45,154
You knew what they might do 
to you, and they did it.

946
01:01:48,951 --> 01:01:51,744
Can't you see that 
you've already won?

947
01:01:51,829 --> 01:01:57,333
You've proved that we are exactly
the kind of people we say we aren't.

948
01:01:59,336 --> 01:02:00,795
Look what they did to you.

949
01:02:02,131 --> 01:02:04,465
You are the bravest man I know.

950
01:02:05,134 --> 01:02:06,801
But it's over now.

951
01:02:07,636 --> 01:02:08,678
There's no proof.

952
01:02:11,306 --> 01:02:13,391
There are no bombs, are there?

953
01:02:23,444 --> 01:02:25,778
No. No, there never were.

954
01:02:29,533 --> 01:02:31,659
There are no bombs.

955
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:34,871
I just want my wife ...

956
01:02:35,372 --> 01:02:37,373
and my kids.

957
01:02:38,709 --> 01:02:41,419
Please, there are no bombs!

958
01:02:41,503 --> 01:02:45,465
Why did you let him keep on?
You could have told me at any time.

959
01:02:47,176 --> 01:02:49,343
I fucked up so bad.

960
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:51,554
My wife,

961
01:02:52,723 --> 01:02:56,809
my religion, my country.

962
01:02:56,894 --> 01:02:58,060
I'm so sorry.

963
01:02:58,145 --> 01:03:00,646
Did you have nuclear 
material at any time?

964
01:03:00,731 --> 01:03:04,358
Nothing. The bombs are empty shells,
there's nothing in them.

965
01:03:04,443 --> 01:03:05,860
Where did you make the video?

966
01:03:07,696 --> 01:03:09,238
No, I don't want them to hear.

967
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,242
Just whisper it in my ear.

968
01:03:18,749 --> 01:03:20,249
Is that right?

969
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:27,340
Please don't let him hurt me 
anymore. Please? Please, please.

970
01:03:42,231 --> 01:03:43,231
It's a hoax.

971
01:03:44,274 --> 01:03:45,566
I knew it was a hoax.

972
01:03:45,651 --> 01:03:47,276
The man has been tortured.

973
01:03:47,361 --> 01:03:50,655
I was leading with my questioning. He 
would say just about anything right now.

974
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:52,615
She's right, you know.

975
01:03:53,575 --> 01:03:55,827
We always knew it was only 
a one percent chance ...

976
01:03:55,911 --> 01:03:57,328
anyone could ever pull
something like this off.

977
01:03:57,412 --> 01:03:58,412
We've got an address.

978
01:03:58,497 --> 01:04:01,457
He said something
was going to happen today.

979
01:04:02,084 --> 01:04:03,584
We need to take that seriously.

980
01:04:25,399 --> 01:04:27,441
- Okay, go, now.
- Let's move.

981
01:04:27,609 --> 01:04:30,027
I'm Special Agent Brody.
This is Special Agent Vincent.

982
01:04:30,112 --> 01:04:31,737
- Major Pierce.
- What do you got?

983
01:04:31,822 --> 01:04:34,866
Not much. EOD is inside now,
checking for booby traps,

984
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:37,535
doing environmental monitoring.
Looking for a source.

985
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:38,953
Let's go.

986
01:04:42,124 --> 01:04:45,209
Helen, if this is a hoax,
then we're all off the hook.

987
01:04:45,294 --> 01:04:47,879
Something's not right, Vince.

988
01:04:47,963 --> 01:04:49,839
He planned all of this.

989
01:04:57,139 --> 01:04:58,973
Hand me the printout.

990
01:05:02,811 --> 01:05:04,145
This one.

991
01:05:06,648 --> 01:05:07,899
It's the same, I'm sure.

992
01:05:07,983 --> 01:05:10,318
Has this area been cleared yet?

993
01:05:11,486 --> 01:05:12,987
Oh, shit.

994
01:05:13,864 --> 01:05:15,072
Pierce?

995
01:05:15,657 --> 01:05:20,494
We have a possible location, 
second floor, southwestern corner.

996
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:24,040
Send a team immediately, please.

997
01:05:24,124 --> 01:05:25,708
On our way, copy that.

998
01:05:26,168 --> 01:05:29,128
God, this whole area
could be booby trapped.

999
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,761
Stay there! Don't move!

1000
01:05:40,515 --> 01:05:42,475
Sir, we found something on the roof.

1001
01:05:50,067 --> 01:05:51,233
Vince.

1002
01:05:56,531 --> 01:05:58,616
He wants us up here.

1003
01:05:58,700 --> 01:05:59,909
Why?

1004
01:06:06,833 --> 01:06:07,833
What the hell is this?

1005
01:06:07,918 --> 01:06:09,543
Don't touch that!

1006
01:06:10,045 --> 01:06:11,045
Shit.

1007
01:06:21,431 --> 01:06:24,850
Experts on the scene think that a bomb
probably made from C4 plastic explosives ...

1008
01:06:24,935 --> 01:06:28,020
has been deliberately detonated
in a downtown shopping mall.

1009
01:06:28,105 --> 01:06:30,147
They did not rule out terrorism.

1010
01:06:30,232 --> 01:06:33,818
So far, we've seen several bodies come 
out. They wouldn't give us a count.

1011
01:06:33,902 --> 01:06:36,946
I got no idea how many casualties 
we've got in there,

1012
01:06:38,407 --> 01:06:40,908
but there are badly injured people.

1013
01:06:42,452 --> 01:06:44,036
People are screaming for help.

1014
01:06:44,121 --> 01:06:46,038
The whole building, it just blew up.

1015
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:55,172
You stupid son-of-a-bitch.

1016
01:06:55,257 --> 01:06:59,260
Okay, okay! lmagine what
three goddamn nukes would do!

1017
01:07:03,765 --> 01:07:05,599
How could you do this?

1018
01:07:05,684 --> 01:07:06,851
How could you?

1019
01:07:06,935 --> 01:07:08,561
You wanted proof,

1020
01:07:09,604 --> 01:07:12,231
I needed a break. 
I can hold out now.

1021
01:07:12,315 --> 01:07:16,527
It was a shopping mall!
Fifty-three people are dead!

1022
01:07:16,611 --> 01:07:20,448
That was your fault. God loves 
them, they're martyrs, all martyrs.

1023
01:07:20,532 --> 01:07:23,701
Fifty-three of them.
Fifty-three bodies blown to pieces!

1024
01:07:23,785 --> 01:07:24,869
- Don't do it, Brody.
- Shut up!

1025
01:07:24,953 --> 01:07:27,163
- Don't.
- Where are those bombs?

1026
01:07:27,247 --> 01:07:28,873
Where are those fucking bombs?

1027
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:30,750
Do it! Do it!

1028
01:07:30,834 --> 01:07:34,420
I love my country, 
you people crap on it!

1029
01:07:34,504 --> 01:07:38,340
I love my religion and 
you people spit on it!

1030
01:07:38,425 --> 01:07:42,553
Just remember something,
I'm here because I want to be here!

1031
01:07:42,637 --> 01:07:46,557
I let myself be caught
because I'm not a coward.

1032
01:07:46,641 --> 01:07:51,312
I chose to meet my 
oppressors face to face!

1033
01:07:52,647 --> 01:07:55,649
You call me a barbarian.

1034
01:07:56,318 --> 01:07:57,568
Then what are you?

1035
01:07:57,652 --> 01:08:01,238
What, you expect me to weep
over 50 civilians?

1036
01:08:01,323 --> 01:08:04,700
You people kill 
that number every day!

1037
01:08:04,785 --> 01:08:09,789
How does it feel, Brody? This is 
not about me. This is about you!

1038
01:08:09,873 --> 01:08:14,585
How does it feel?
You have no authority here! None!

1039
01:08:14,753 --> 01:08:18,756
There is but one authority 
and it is not you!

1040
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,341
You are a blight!

1041
01:08:20,425 --> 01:08:22,927
You are a cancer!

1042
01:08:23,011 --> 01:08:24,970
How does it feel, Brody?

1043
01:08:36,441 --> 01:08:38,359
What's going on, Helen?

1044
01:08:39,903 --> 01:08:42,530
Do you want me to take that?

1045
01:09:02,342 --> 01:09:05,052
Boss, Younger got a 
parking ticket in Dallas.

1046
01:09:05,137 --> 01:09:08,139
They traced the address to a derelict 
warehouse. They found a bomb.

1047
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,473
They think it's real. It's nuclear.

1048
01:09:09,558 --> 01:09:12,893
It may contain four, four and a half 
pounds, set to detonate Friday at noon.

1049
01:09:12,978 --> 01:09:14,520
It was well hidden, 
perfectly shielded.

1050
01:09:14,604 --> 01:09:16,730
We got real lucky, but there's 
less than three hours left.

1051
01:09:16,815 --> 01:09:18,232
Airborne detection came up empty.

1052
01:09:18,316 --> 01:09:19,900
There's almost no chance
to find the other two in time.

1053
01:09:19,985 --> 01:09:24,697
Brody? I need you to come in,
he's in a state.

1054
01:09:24,781 --> 01:09:26,448
Of course he's in a state.
He's being tortured to death.

1055
01:09:26,533 --> 01:09:28,784
Not Younger, H. He wants you.

1056
01:09:49,264 --> 01:09:50,723
He might not crack.

1057
01:09:52,267 --> 01:09:53,309
What are you saying?

1058
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,437
He might not crack.

1059
01:09:56,521 --> 01:09:57,980
There's only three hours left.

1060
01:10:01,818 --> 01:10:04,778
Look, ten million people 
are about to die.

1061
01:10:04,863 --> 01:10:06,864
Are you still in, or not?

1062
01:10:20,837 --> 01:10:23,797
If you tell me to stop, I will.

1063
01:10:24,966 --> 01:10:26,300
I'll stop.

1064
01:11:09,511 --> 01:11:10,511
Yes.

1065
01:11:12,013 --> 01:11:14,932
Brody, they got Jehan Younger.

1066
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:22,064
Where are my children?
I want to see them right now.

1067
01:11:22,148 --> 01:11:23,774
They're in protective custody.
Please calm down.

1068
01:11:23,858 --> 01:11:27,611
Don't tell me to calm down.
I want my children!

1069
01:11:27,696 --> 01:11:29,822
Mrs. Younger, please take a seat
and we'll talk about this.

1070
01:11:29,906 --> 01:11:33,200
I am not saying a word to you
until you let me see my kids!

1071
01:11:33,285 --> 01:11:35,869
Mrs. Younger,
you are in very serious trouble.

1072
01:11:35,954 --> 01:11:39,540
You'll be charged with supporting terrorism
if you do not cooperate with us immediately.

1073
01:11:39,624 --> 01:11:41,083
That is a life sentence.

1074
01:11:41,167 --> 01:11:44,461
Your children will be put in foster care
and you will never see them again.

1075
01:11:44,546 --> 01:11:48,132
Now, sit the fuck down and 
start telling us what you know.

1076
01:11:48,216 --> 01:11:50,134
Brody, come out here, please.

1077
01:11:59,602 --> 01:12:01,312
- I'm taking her in there with him.
- What?

1078
01:12:01,396 --> 01:12:04,481
The wife is our ace in the hole. You 
can talk to him now, get some answers.

1079
01:12:04,566 --> 01:12:05,649
But we haven't interrogated her.

1080
01:12:05,734 --> 01:12:06,859
She could tell us 
where the bombs are.

1081
01:12:06,943 --> 01:12:10,654
We don't have time. We have to take 
her in there, question her and him.

1082
01:12:10,739 --> 01:12:14,033
But we have to do it right
and we got to do it now.

1083
01:12:21,791 --> 01:12:23,876
What are you doing to me?

1084
01:12:25,253 --> 01:12:26,920
What kind of animals are you?

1085
01:12:27,005 --> 01:12:29,131
You saw the tape. 
We didn't make it, he did.

1086
01:12:29,215 --> 01:12:30,799
He's a liar, he would never do that.

1087
01:12:30,884 --> 01:12:32,843
It's real and 
we think you're in on it.

1088
01:12:32,927 --> 01:12:34,470
Do you ever want to
see your children again?

1089
01:12:34,554 --> 01:12:36,013
I never knew anything about this.

1090
01:12:36,097 --> 01:12:39,141
We don't believe you, Jehan.
Tell us something.

1091
01:12:51,613 --> 01:12:53,322
Jehan.

1092
01:12:53,406 --> 01:12:55,407
What have you done to him?

1093
01:12:57,869 --> 01:12:59,411
You pigs.

1094
01:12:59,496 --> 01:13:03,207
Now, Jehan, for your sake and ours,

1095
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:06,627
I want you to ask him 
where the bombs are.

1096
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:11,715
Say, "Yusuf, please tell me
where the bombs are, darling?"

1097
01:13:13,635 --> 01:13:15,469
- Say it!
- Yusuf,

1098
01:13:16,721 --> 01:13:19,098
where are the bombs?

1099
01:13:19,182 --> 01:13:21,725
I think she still loves you, Yusuf.

1100
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:24,186
She wants to save you.

1101
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:26,897
Tell him. Tell him you love him.

1102
01:13:30,902 --> 01:13:32,778
I love you, Yusuf.

1103
01:13:34,781 --> 01:13:37,324
This is what you wanted, Yusuf.

1104
01:13:37,409 --> 01:13:39,910
What you wanted!

1105
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:46,667
So, now I'm gonna cut some little 
pieces off Jehan and give them to you.

1106
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,460
- Oh, no.
- No.

1107
01:13:48,545 --> 01:13:50,087
- What the hell are you doing?
- Alvarez, hold the chair.

1108
01:13:50,171 --> 01:13:52,005
- No, please.
- H., you can't do this!

1109
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:54,883
Please, stop him! Please!
I'm an American citizen!

1110
01:13:54,968 --> 01:13:56,593
- H.
- Shut up, Charlie.

1111
01:13:56,678 --> 01:13:59,555
We're not gonna let you do this.
It's not just me now.

1112
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:02,349
Oh, so now you're 
all working against me?

1113
01:14:02,434 --> 01:14:07,104
Do you want to know where the bombs 
are or not? It's my responsibility!

1114
01:14:07,188 --> 01:14:08,814
You want me to win,
or you want him to win?

1115
01:14:08,898 --> 01:14:10,315
H., put the knife down.

1116
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,985
So you made a choice, 
you want him to win?

1117
01:14:13,069 --> 01:14:14,945
You're all so fucking selfish.

1118
01:14:15,029 --> 01:14:17,614
This is not about you!

1119
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:20,659
This is war. This is sacrifice.

1120
01:14:22,495 --> 01:14:23,829
Take her back.

1121
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:28,375
No!

1122
01:14:31,421 --> 01:14:33,297
- There's no time!
- No! Jehan!

1123
01:14:33,381 --> 01:14:34,506
There's no time!

1124
01:14:34,591 --> 01:14:36,133
No!

1125
01:14:36,217 --> 01:14:38,469
There's no time!

1126
01:15:04,078 --> 01:15:05,078
H.

1127
01:15:12,253 --> 01:15:14,129
Government officials in each city ...

1128
01:15:14,214 --> 01:15:20,511
are currently being evacuated
to nuclear shelters.

1129
01:15:23,264 --> 01:15:25,724
Our own families have already gone.

1130
01:15:28,603 --> 01:15:31,563
Bound to be some rumors, panic.

1131
01:15:36,152 --> 01:15:38,278
We need you to finish this.

1132
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:27,703
You're gonna die here today.

1133
01:16:27,787 --> 01:16:29,621
You know that, right?

1134
01:16:31,624 --> 01:16:33,667
We both know it.

1135
01:16:35,169 --> 01:16:37,254
They won't stop me now.

1136
01:16:38,339 --> 01:16:40,007
There's no limits.

1137
01:17:11,456 --> 01:17:13,206
What are you doing?

1138
01:17:14,584 --> 01:17:16,126
He needs a little break.

1139
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:18,712
For God's sake, we have no time.

1140
01:17:19,672 --> 01:17:21,632
Well, what do you think 
I should do, Helen?

1141
01:17:21,716 --> 01:17:24,009
You son-of-a-bitch.
What do you want me to say?

1142
01:17:25,011 --> 01:17:26,595
Just do what you have to do!

1143
01:17:30,475 --> 01:17:33,602
What I have to do, Agent Brody, is ...

1144
01:17:37,565 --> 01:17:39,066
unthinkable.

1145
01:17:44,656 --> 01:17:46,615
Bring me the children.

1146
01:17:46,699 --> 01:17:48,158
Jesus.

1147
01:17:48,242 --> 01:17:52,579
Give me the children, I'll give you the 
answers you want. Just bring them in.

1148
01:17:52,664 --> 01:17:54,456
I'm not doing that.

1149
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:57,167
Just let him see them.
Let him see them with me.

1150
01:17:57,251 --> 01:17:58,251
No.

1151
01:17:59,003 --> 01:18:00,087
Over my dead body.

1152
01:18:00,171 --> 01:18:01,797
- Kids are right outside.
- No!

1153
01:18:01,881 --> 01:18:04,341
- You just don't get it, do you?
- You're not gonna hurt those children.

1154
01:18:04,425 --> 01:18:05,425
- Do you think I would?
- Yes!

1155
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:06,885
Good! Then so will he.

1156
01:18:06,969 --> 01:18:10,347
It's all been leading up to this.
He has to believe H. will do anything.

1157
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:13,058
Look, all you have to do 
is bring them in,

1158
01:18:13,142 --> 01:18:15,644
take them in the room and strap 
them down. That's it.

1159
01:18:15,728 --> 01:18:19,356
- No.
- I won't harm them. I give you my word.

1160
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,857
But he has to believe I will.

1161
01:18:20,942 --> 01:18:24,861
Then he will tell us anything 
we want, all right?

1162
01:18:25,238 --> 01:18:27,280
All right, I'll do it.

1163
01:18:27,615 --> 01:18:29,950
If you hurt those children, 
I will kill you.

1164
01:18:30,034 --> 01:18:31,535
Fine, Agent Brody.

1165
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:34,121
That's if we don't all die
from an explosion first.

1166
01:18:34,914 --> 01:18:36,248
Jesus, fuck it.

1167
01:19:02,442 --> 01:19:04,192
Come on, this way.

1168
01:19:11,325 --> 01:19:12,701
You ready, Yusuf?

1169
01:19:12,785 --> 01:19:14,911
Gonna keep you safe.

1170
01:19:14,996 --> 01:19:17,247
This is the end.

1171
01:19:17,331 --> 01:19:21,084
Nothing I do to you 
could make you talk.

1172
01:19:21,169 --> 01:19:22,169
Not now.

1173
01:19:34,849 --> 01:19:36,725
Look at your children.

1174
01:19:37,435 --> 01:19:39,436
Aren't you proud of them?

1175
01:19:44,025 --> 01:19:45,192
Don't.

1176
01:19:46,027 --> 01:19:47,944
Don't let him do it, 
don't let him, I beg you.

1177
01:19:48,029 --> 01:19:50,363
Yusuf. Yusuf, talk to us.

1178
01:19:51,866 --> 01:19:54,534
You leave my fucking babies alone.

1179
01:19:54,619 --> 01:19:56,036
Talk to us, Yusuf.

1180
01:19:59,457 --> 01:20:00,457
No!

1181
01:20:04,879 --> 01:20:08,381
Fuck! You fuck! You fuck!

1182
01:20:11,177 --> 01:20:12,469
New York! There's a bomb in New York!

1183
01:20:12,553 --> 01:20:14,054
Where in New York? 
Give me an address.

1184
01:20:14,138 --> 01:20:15,472
Fuck you! Stop him!

1185
01:20:15,556 --> 01:20:18,892
- Get him away from my fucking babies!
- Give me an address!

1186
01:20:18,976 --> 01:20:21,102
701 West 83rd, second floor!

1187
01:20:21,187 --> 01:20:22,395
- Stop him!
- Second one?

1188
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,856
- Fucking stop him now!
- Give me the second one!

1189
01:20:24,941 --> 01:20:29,778
Los Angeles, 18750 Centinela,
garage underneath it! Fucking stop him!

1190
01:20:29,862 --> 01:20:31,571
Give me the third one! We don't 
fucking believe you, Yusuf!

1191
01:20:31,656 --> 01:20:35,492
Fuck! Please! I beg you, 
please stop him!

1192
01:20:35,743 --> 01:20:37,285
Give me the third one, Yusuf.

1193
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:40,831
Dallas. Basement, 1533 Smith.
Don't let him hurt them, please!

1194
01:20:40,915 --> 01:20:41,915
Dallas, basement.

1195
01:20:41,999 --> 01:20:43,124
Please, please don't let him
hurt them. Please.

1196
01:20:44,585 --> 01:20:46,586
H., he told us. 
He told us where they are.

1197
01:20:47,421 --> 01:20:49,339
- He's lying.
- No, he's not!

1198
01:20:49,423 --> 01:20:51,967
The bomb we already found in Dallas.
He gave the right address.

1199
01:20:52,051 --> 01:20:53,760
How long before you verify the others?

1200
01:20:54,262 --> 01:20:56,638
- Twenty.
- Twenty minutes.

1201
01:20:56,722 --> 01:20:58,306
Well, I have 20 minutes 
with them then.

1202
01:20:59,016 --> 01:21:01,601
"We will assume that the current methods
of interrogation will continue ...

1203
01:21:01,727 --> 01:21:03,979
"unless otherwise directed
by a higher authority."

1204
01:21:04,272 --> 01:21:06,523
He sounds serious. 
He can't be serious?

1205
01:21:06,607 --> 01:21:08,775
H., this operation is terminated!

1206
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:11,736
None of you respect my work, do you?

1207
01:21:11,821 --> 01:21:16,950
None of you understand! We don't 
stop until this all checks out!

1208
01:21:17,493 --> 01:21:18,869
- Shit.
- That's the ruIe!

1209
01:21:18,953 --> 01:21:21,705
It's my duty to continue!

1210
01:21:21,789 --> 01:21:22,956
H.?

1211
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,208
They're children, innocent children!

1212
01:21:25,293 --> 01:21:29,504
There are no innocent children!
Not his children anyway.

1213
01:21:29,881 --> 01:21:34,676
Too selfish and weak
to carry out his own plan? No.

1214
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:38,889
No, I don't think so. 
I don't believe it! Not from him.

1215
01:21:38,973 --> 01:21:41,141
No! Stop him! Please!

1216
01:21:41,225 --> 01:21:43,643
Yusuf! There's more, isn't there?

1217
01:21:43,728 --> 01:21:44,853
No, no, no!

1218
01:21:44,937 --> 01:21:46,813
Do you believe I can do this?

1219
01:21:46,898 --> 01:21:49,065
H., he believes it! He believes it!

1220
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:51,401
Faith is not enough, 
he has to know it.

1221
01:21:51,485 --> 01:21:52,485
He knows it!

1222
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:55,822
Knowing it is not enough, 
he has to see it.

1223
01:21:55,907 --> 01:21:57,574
No! Get him out of there!

1224
01:21:57,658 --> 01:22:01,995
All right, that's enough! Winston, get 
over here and blow that goddamn door!

1225
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:03,079
Clear the door!

1226
01:22:05,499 --> 01:22:06,958
Check, check!

1227
01:22:07,043 --> 01:22:08,752
Goddamn it! Take it out!

1228
01:22:10,212 --> 01:22:11,379
Check!

1229
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,381
Move it!

1230
01:22:13,466 --> 01:22:15,342
H.! Stand down! Stand down!

1231
01:22:20,723 --> 01:22:22,807
All right, that's enough. 
That's enough!

1232
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:28,772
- Get the medic!
- No! Get them out of here!

1233
01:22:28,856 --> 01:22:31,608
No one else sees them, you 
understand me? Nobody sees them!

1234
01:22:31,692 --> 01:22:33,944
What's the matter with you?

1235
01:22:34,028 --> 01:22:36,029
Get up! Get up!

1236
01:22:41,869 --> 01:22:43,036
You knew.

1237
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,120
You knew he could do this.

1238
01:22:44,205 --> 01:22:47,248
- You had those kids lined up for him!
- I didn't know he'd go crazy!

1239
01:22:56,759 --> 01:22:59,970
That man over there killed 53 people.

1240
01:23:00,054 --> 01:23:03,431
Some of them women and children,
and yet somehow I'm the villain?

1241
01:23:03,516 --> 01:23:06,476
You keep your mouth shut, 
you maniac. You're fucking evil!

1242
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,686
Oh, and he's not?

1243
01:23:13,067 --> 01:23:15,151
You hear that, Yusuf?

1244
01:23:15,236 --> 01:23:16,903
You win.

1245
01:23:16,988 --> 01:23:20,073
You got them all on your side now.

1246
01:23:20,157 --> 01:23:21,741
You're in the clear.

1247
01:23:23,953 --> 01:23:26,538
You don't even have to tell them
about the fourth bomb.

1248
01:23:30,418 --> 01:23:32,419
What do you mean?

1249
01:23:32,503 --> 01:23:33,962
Don't you know him by now?

1250
01:23:34,046 --> 01:23:36,673
He's planned this 
every step of the way.

1251
01:23:36,757 --> 01:23:38,800
I mean, what if he 
couldn't hold out?

1252
01:23:38,884 --> 01:23:41,052
All he's got to do
is give us the three bombs, right?

1253
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:48,393
Now I remember 15 to 18 pounds
of nuclear material missing.

1254
01:23:50,604 --> 01:23:51,980
Can't you fucking count?

1255
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:58,903
Four and a half times three is 
13 and a half, times four is 18.

1256
01:24:00,614 --> 01:24:02,407
Give you three guesses what he did.

1257
01:24:03,075 --> 01:24:04,909
- Ask him.
- You think there's another bomb?

1258
01:24:04,994 --> 01:24:08,246
Course there's another bomb.
There's always another bomb.

1259
01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:11,750
He didn't tell you about the mall bomb.
But he gave you the other three.

1260
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,795
Yes, Agent Brody, 
there's a fourth bomb.

1261
01:24:16,756 --> 01:24:19,007
Oh, Christ! 
Get those kids back in here.

1262
01:24:19,091 --> 01:24:22,886
If anyone tries to stop you, 
shoot him. That is a direct order!

1263
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:24,387
No. No bomb.

1264
01:24:24,472 --> 01:24:25,805
We can't do this.

1265
01:24:25,890 --> 01:24:29,225
- Brody, if there's a one percent chance ...
- He's a maniac,

1266
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:32,312
You just said so! 
We have no evidence.

1267
01:24:32,396 --> 01:24:34,272
But if we did 
it would be all right. Right?

1268
01:24:34,356 --> 01:24:36,316
You'll get the children back.

1269
01:24:36,442 --> 01:24:38,026
Really? And what shall 
I do with them this time?

1270
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:40,153
- How far can I go?
- Just do the job, H.

1271
01:24:43,491 --> 01:24:44,699
I have a condition.

1272
01:24:45,534 --> 01:24:47,494
You. You go out there ...

1273
01:24:47,578 --> 01:24:51,081
and drag those kids back in here 
kicking, screaming and begging.

1274
01:24:51,165 --> 01:24:53,583
You take them in there
and strap them down,

1275
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:56,669
'cause you're the only person 
here with any decency.

1276
01:24:56,754 --> 01:25:01,091
Fuck Alvarez, fuck Charlie.
Fuck all the rest of these fucks.

1277
01:25:01,175 --> 01:25:03,301
- You do it.
- Why me?

1278
01:25:03,803 --> 01:25:06,596
'Cause if you can do it, 
then anybody can.

1279
01:25:08,057 --> 01:25:10,058
H., there is no time for games.

1280
01:25:10,142 --> 01:25:11,768
I'm not playing games.

1281
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:14,270
I need your help.

1282
01:25:15,272 --> 01:25:17,690
Tell me I can do this.

1283
01:25:17,775 --> 01:25:21,111
Brody, this is his two kids
against thousands of ours.

1284
01:25:21,195 --> 01:25:23,446
Justify me,

1285
01:25:23,531 --> 01:25:24,781
tell me it's okay.

1286
01:25:24,865 --> 01:25:26,699
- If there's another bomb out there ...
- You can't do this!

1287
01:25:26,784 --> 01:25:28,743
We're fucking human beings.

1288
01:25:28,828 --> 01:25:32,038
Let the bomb go off! 
We cannot do this!

1289
01:25:41,841 --> 01:25:43,091
That's it.

1290
01:25:50,724 --> 01:25:52,100
You're a free man, Yusuf.

1291
01:25:52,685 --> 01:25:55,270
They can't prosecute
a man with no fingernails.

1292
01:25:55,354 --> 01:25:56,521
What the hell are you doing?

1293
01:25:56,605 --> 01:25:58,940
This is it. I'm letting him go.

1294
01:26:00,025 --> 01:26:01,651
We're done here.

1295
01:26:06,115 --> 01:26:07,991
We're not finished.

1296
01:26:08,075 --> 01:26:10,326
Where are those fucking kids?

1297
01:26:10,411 --> 01:26:12,245
What are you gonna do? 
Shoot me?

1298
01:26:13,372 --> 01:26:15,790
Who's gonna do your dirty work 
for you? You gonna do it yourself?

1299
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:18,418
You don't think 
I have that covered?

1300
01:26:18,752 --> 01:26:21,254
We have your children, H.

1301
01:26:21,881 --> 01:26:22,922
Do you understand?

1302
01:26:23,507 --> 01:26:26,426
- Just get back to it. Right now!
- We need to calm down, okay?

1303
01:26:27,094 --> 01:26:28,094
Shit.

1304
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:31,681
Put your fucking weapon down
or I'll fucking shoot you.

1305
01:26:31,765 --> 01:26:35,185
No, don't shoot him. Don't shoot 
him! If he dies, we're screwed.

1306
01:26:35,269 --> 01:26:36,644
Yusuf, put that gun down.

1307
01:26:37,813 --> 01:26:38,938
Yusuf!

1308
01:26:44,445 --> 01:26:45,486
It's okay.

1309
01:26:51,285 --> 01:26:53,286
Everything's gonna be okay.

1310
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:57,290
Please look after my children.

1311
01:26:57,958 --> 01:26:59,042
- Jesus.
- No.

1312
01:27:16,393 --> 01:27:18,019
We've done all we can.

1313
01:27:20,773 --> 01:27:22,607
Let's just hope.

1314
01:27:24,944 --> 01:27:26,778
We'll know soon enough.

1315
01:27:31,325 --> 01:27:33,076
Been nice working 
with you, Agent Brody.

1316
01:27:45,339 --> 01:27:47,173
This never happened.

1317
01:27:48,133 --> 01:27:49,467
They never existed.

1318
01:27:49,551 --> 01:27:54,222
Younger, the children, 
none of them.

1319
01:28:43,564 --> 01:28:46,691
18570 Centinela. That's the address.
We got it in sight.

1320
01:28:48,694 --> 01:28:50,570
Location has been confirmed. 
You are a go.

1321
01:28:52,573 --> 01:28:54,198
Get bomb disposal!

1322
01:28:54,283 --> 01:28:56,701
We're at the northeast corner of the 
building. We've located the device.

1323
01:28:56,785 --> 01:28:57,869
Copy that.

1324
01:28:58,912 --> 01:29:01,080
All right, 
stand clear and make room.

1325
01:29:01,415 --> 01:29:03,499
Bomb disposal, 
you are clear at the scene.

1326
01:29:27,024 --> 01:29:28,024
We're good.

1327
01:29:28,108 --> 01:29:31,069
The bomb is disarmed.
I repeat, the bomb is disarmed.

1328
01:29:35,616 --> 01:29:37,742
Congratulations, Major.
