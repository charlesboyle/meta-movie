I had a surprise this morning.

to fully close the freezer door.

with the portions.

00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,204
He's asking about my purse?

343
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,366
Come on. I gotta go check your purse.

344
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,375
Sandra, you know I haven't been
to my purse since the staff meeting.

345
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,376
Let's just get this over with.

346
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,832
Let's just get this over with.

347
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,303
I didn't take anything.
I swear. You know me.

348
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,304
I've never stolen anything
in my entire life.

349
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,715
If it turns out that you did,

350
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,724
I'm going to have to
fire you on the spot.

351
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,725
Please, Sandra.

352
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,851
- All right.
- No!

353
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,136
Let's just get this over with.

354
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,805
Which one of them is yours?

355
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,518
[Unzips bag]

356
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,028
Is this about the freezer?

357
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,064
'Cause I really don't think
I had anything to do with that,

358
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,733
but if I did, I'm sorry, okay?

359
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,152
I'm sorry, honey,
but we have to take this seriously.

360
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,117
No, it is not about the freezer.
It's about the cops.

361
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,371
- Does this zipper part open?
- Yes.

362
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,376
[zipper unzips]

363
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,254
We can't have employees
stealing from a customer, you know.

364
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,508
But I was working. You saw me.
I was up there.

365
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,637
Okay. Then why do I have a police officer
calling me, describing you exactly,

366
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:24,174
telling me your name and saying
that you stole from a customer?

367
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,967
What am I supposed to do with that?

368
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,260
I don't know. Just--

369
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,555
I guess I have to take this with me now.

370
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,721
Come on.

371
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,481
You okay, Sandra?

372
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,065
SANDRA: Still dealing with it.

373
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,537
Hello, Officer? Hello?

374
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,198
<i>Yeah. What--</i>
<i>What's the news?</i>

375
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:52,585
I didn't find anything
in her purse or in her pockets.

376
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,579
<i>I was afraid that might happen.</i>

377
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,715
<i>Okay, this is gonna require</i>
<i>more of your help, then.</i>

378
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,047
<i>I'm gonna need you</i>
<i>to keep her there.</i>

379
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,337
<i>Me and my marked units</i>
<i>are gonna come in soon.</i>

380
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,598
<i>Till then, can I count on you</i>
<i>to assist the authorities?</i>

381
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,928
Um, yes, of course.

382
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,970
Whatever you--
Whatever you need.

383
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,185
She's been a good person
here at the restaurant.

384
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,725
SANDRA: I--You're sure about this?

385
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,815
<i>Are we sure about this?</i>

386
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:22,608
<i>I have the victim here with me.</i>
<i>Why, you think she's innocent?</i>

387
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:26,368
We just never had any trouble
with her before. That's all.

388
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,781
<i>Right, but, I mean,</i>
<i>doesn't it make sense</i>

389
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,620
<i>that if she was doing</i>
<i>something wrong, that...</i>

390
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,126
<i>she wouldn't want you to know,</i>
<i>that she'd--</i>

391
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,629
<i>I don't know--hide it from you?</i>

392
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,584
Yeah, I guess.

393
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,592
<i>Right.</i>

394
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,627
Yeah.

395
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,795
<i>Well, look, I hear a little...</i>

396
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,385
<i>hesitation in your voice, Sandra?</i>

397
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,552
<i>- No, no. I'm, you know--</i>
<i>- It's okay, you know?</i>

398
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,015
I'm just trying to do the right--

399
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,395
<i>- Yeah, it's fine.</i>
<i>- What I'm--Yeah.</i>

400
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,352
<i>Look, Sandra, I'm the police officer.</i>

401
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,018
<i>I'm the one who's gotta take the hit.</i>

402
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,527
SANDRA: Yes.

403
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,359
<i>I want you to know that as an officer,</i>

404
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,990
<i>the officer in this case,</i>

405
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,867
<i>I have to take the full,</i>
<i>final responsibility for this,</i>

406
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,529
<i>- and I take that very seriously, okay?</i>
<i>- Right. Right. Yes.</i>

407
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,244
<i>And I have your regional manager,</i>
<i>Robert Gilmour, on the other line.</i>

408
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,374
- Right.
<i>- We need to act now.</i>

409
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,536
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Your responsibility</i>

410
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:21,166
<i>is to facilitate that action,</i>
<i>so I--I don't even...</i>

411
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,676
<i>You know, it's your job.</i>
<i>You understand?</i>

412
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,138
Yes. Yes, I do,

413
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,641
and I'll do everything, you know,
that you need.

414
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,677
<i>All right. Can you put Becky</i>
<i>on for me, please?</i>

415
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,641
Sure.

416
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,477
Wants to talk to you.

417
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,442
Hello, Officer.

418
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,814
<i>All right, I need you to shoot me straight</i>
<i>and just explain this whole situation to me.</i>

419
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,779
I have no idea what happened.
I don't know what's going on.

420
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,784
I was working.
I was up front. I was wor--

421
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,695
You can ask anybody
that was up there with me.

422
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,987
<i>- Do me a favor and calm down.</i>
<i>- I was--</i>

423
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,784
<i>Just calm down</i>
<i>and explain the situation to me, okay?</i>

424
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,120
All I know is that I was working,

425
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,336
and then Sandra came and told me
that I stole some lady's money.

426
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,341
That--That is everything that I know.

427
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,175
<i>You stole some lady's money.</i>
<i>Did you know the lady in question?</i>

428
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,093
No. I don--I can't even think of anyone
that it would possibly be.

429
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,727
<i>- Miss, be quiet.</i>
- There's no one--

430
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,604
Now, had you seen this woman
before on the premises?

431
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,232
<i>If you're just straight with me,</i>
<i>it'll all be worked out, okay?</i>

432
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,814
I am being s--
I'm--I'm being straight with you.

433
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,776
<i>Okay, so what that tells me is</i>
<i>that you don't realize</i>

434
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,316
<i>what kind of trouble you're in here.</i>

435
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,487
<i>I'm gonna need you to address me</i>
<i>as sir or officer, understand?</i>

436
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,748
Yes, sir.

437
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,159
<i>Okay, good.</i>

438
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,662
<i>Now, first we need to find the money.</i>

439
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,830
<i>Now, do--do you want</i>
<i>to tell me where it is?</i>

440
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,543
I don't have any money.

441
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,211
<i>You don't have any money?</i>

442
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,051
<i>Well, why are there people</i>
<i>who say otherwise?</i>

443
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,592
I don't know.

444
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,635
<i>You don't know.</i>

445
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,271
<i>- I don't know why.</i>
<i>- You don't know! Huh! Okay.</i>

446
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,934
<i>This isn't the easy way</i>
<i>out of this, you understand?</i>

447
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,773
What--What can I do?
How can I help? Like--

448
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,107
<i>Just put Sandra back on,</i>

449
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,113
<i>but you need to do</i>
<i>what she tells you, okay?</i>

450
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,321
I mean, yeah, of course.
Of course I'm gonna do what she tells me to,

451
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,827
and I'm gonna do what you tell me to.

452
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,612
<i>- Then we'll be okay, okay?</i>
<i>- That's fine, but--</i>

453
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,414
- Okay.
<i>- Just put Sandra back on the phone, please.</i>

454
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,574
All right.

455
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,378
Hello?

456
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,757
<i>Hi, Sandra. Uh, I'll need your help</i>
<i>till I can get down there.</i>

457
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,133
<i>We really have two choices here.</i>

458
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,589
Okay, what do you need?

459
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,174
<i>We need to find the money,</i>

460
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,635
<i>but I want to make this</i>
<i>as easy as possible for Becky.</i>

461
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,095
<i>Wouldn't you agree?</i>

462
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,759
Yes, I would.

463
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,428
<i>So that's the first thing.</i>

464
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,518
<i>And in this situation, either--</i>

465
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,560
<i>and I don't like this--</i>
<i>we drag her downtown.</i>

466
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,274
<i>We book her.</i>
<i>We process her.</i>

467
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,235
<i>We put her in a holding cell,</i>
<i>where she'll probably be all night.</i>

468
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,196
That seems very extreme.

469
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,328
<i>Yeah. I mean, I think in order to</i>
<i>keep this sort of contained,</i>

470
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:59,957
<i>what we could do is just have you</i>
<i>strip-search her right now.</i>

471
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,789
<i>Would just be easier and quicker, I think.</i>

472
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,294
Gee, I don't know if--

473
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,299
I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.

474
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,256
<i>Yeah, I know, but her story</i>
<i>doesn't jibe, see?</i>

475
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,171
<i>- You know, I mean--</i>
<i>- I know, but it means</i>

476
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,214
<i>we have to put her into the system,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

477
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,935
<i>Look, I understand you not wanting</i>
<i>to get involved, but...</i>

478
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,812
[sighs] Gee, I'm not sure...

479
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,769
<i>In my experience,</i>
<i>it could be a very big deal.</i>

480
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,103
...to be honest.

481
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,815
<i>Yeah, well, a trial</i>
<i>can drag on a long time.</i>

482
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,275
<i>There's a direct cost to her</i>
<i>being taken in.</i>

483
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,236
- Sandra...
- Yeah. Um...

484
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,526
<i>federal conviction rate is over 90 %.</i>

485
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,660
<i>You know, she seems like a nice person.</i>

486
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:37,866
Yeah.

487
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,496
<i>If there's any doubt, you know,</i>

488
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,750
<i>having you do it there</i>
<i>could be a big help to her.</i>

489
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,376
Yeah. I mean, it seems--
I'm not--

490
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,000
<i>I don't want you to worry about this part,</i>

491
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,542
<i>because I have to take the full,</i>
<i>final responsibility for this,</i>

492
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,552
<i>and I do, and I take that</i>
<i>very seriously.</i>

493
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,588
<i>So take that off your shoulders.</i>

494
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,972
Um...

495
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,097
Okay.
Just--Just a second.

496
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,013
He's saying that...

497
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,977
[sighs] that he will have
to take you down to jail

498
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:12,738
and that, most likely,
you'll have to spend the night,

499
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,070
or I could, um--

500
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,405
I could strip-search you here.

501
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,487
What? No.

502
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,497
No.

503
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,366
No way.

504
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,705
<i>Just tell her that it's gonna be quicker</i>
<i>if you strip-search her.</i>

505
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,415
This'll all be over quicker.

506
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:28,962
SANDRA:
'Cause if we go to the jail...

507
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,297
Beck, if we go to the jail,
it just takes much longer.

508
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,799
This is so stupid.
I didn't do anything at all.

509
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,181
<i>What did she say?</i>

510
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,138
Um...

511
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,724
<i>It? either that or take her to jail</i>
<i>and hold her overnight, okay?</i>

512
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,889
Hold on. So, honey,
what do you want to do?

513
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,692
I mean, what--
what do you mean?

514
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,569
What I mean is it looks like

515
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,901
we're either gonna have
to go down to the jail--

516
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,532
<i>we don't have much of a choice--</i>

517
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,658
or, you know, I can do it here,

518
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,698
which I think is really much,
much easier for you. Don't you?

519
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,661
<i>Okay'</i>

520
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,126
- Okay.
- Okay. You want me to search you...

521
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,666
BECKY: Search. Yeah, search.
Okay, search. God.

522
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,256
So we'll--
we'll just do that really quickly.

523
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,342
I'll get Marti in here,
and we'll do it really quick, okay?

524
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,757
<i>She say yes?</i>

525
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,470
Yeah, can you just bring Marti in here?

526
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:27,472
Yeah. She is saying yes, but I think I need
to get my shift supervisor in here, right?

527
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,436
<i>Well, it'd be best not</i>
<i>to have her actually.</i>

528
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,021
<i>It's faster for everyone</i>
<i>the quicker it can happen.</i>

529
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,811
Yeah, but she's asking for Marti,

530
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,901
and I think in situations like this,

531
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,408
corporate would insist on having
two supervisors present. I mean...

532
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,740
<i>Oka--Oh, corporate does?</i>

533
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,372
Yeah. Well, I mean,
what does Robbie think?

534
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,200
<i>What does Robbie think?</i>

535
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,208
Yeah, about--

536
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,289
<i>Oh, oh, Robert?</i>

537
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,213
<i>You know what? I don't know.</i>
<i>Let me ask him. Hold on.</i>

538
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,959
He's talking to Robbie.

539
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,722
- Is Marti up front?
- Oh, she went to the back.

540
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,727
I'm sure Becky didn't have
anything to do with it.

541
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:07,762
What?

542
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,475
Is this all about the freezer?

543
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,560
No, no, no.

544
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,317
- L-ls everything okay with Becky?
- Not really.

545
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,024
Okay, Marti, I need you
to come with me to the office.

546
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,984
I know we're swamped,
but this is important.

547
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:21,859
<i>DANIELS:</i>
<i>I know you don't want to do this,</i>

548
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,994
<i>but it's gonna be okay.</i>
<i>It's fine, really.</i>

549
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,826
<i>I've done a million of these,</i>

550
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,707
<i>and, it's fine, you know.</i>
<i>It's not pleasant.</i>

551
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,459
<i>I mean, you don't like it.</i>
<i>I don't like it.</i>

552
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:35,624
<i>I don't know any guy, as many years</i>
<i>as I've been on the job, enjoys this.</i>

553
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,296
<i>Think about poor Sandra.</i>

554
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,970
Yeah.

555
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,176
<i>You know what, Becky?</i>

556
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,216
<i>You seem like a nice person, honestly.</i>

557
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:48,761
<i>I, you know, I hate to get</i>
<i>conflicting information like this,</i>

558
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,601
<i>and it's, uh, confusing,</i>

559
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,562
<i>and it bothers me as much</i>
<i>as I'm sure it bothers you, so...</i>

560
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:54,691
Yes.

561
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,477
<i>I mean, it'd be really helpful</i>

562
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,487
<i>for me and for her, I'm sure,</i>

563
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:02,116
<i>if you're a good girl</i>
<i>and you make it easy on Sandra.</i>

564
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,448
<i>I just--I need you to be</i>
<i>a good actress for her,</i>

565
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:09,912
<i>uh, you know, if you could pretend</i>
<i>like it doesn't bother you, okay?</i>

566
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,576
Okay, I mean, it just--

567
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,379
It's really crazy.
I've never done anything like this.

568
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,586
Like, I'm really freaked out.
I--You know what I mean?

569
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,092
I just want it all to be over.

570
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,718
<i>[laughs] No, I don't know what you mean,</i>

571
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,130
<i>because I've never stolen money</i>
<i>while I was at work like you,</i>

572
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,843
<i>because I don't commit crimes.</i>

573
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,223
Well, I haven't done that either.

574
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,887
<i>Listen, Becky, have you ever</i>
<i>been arrested before?</i>

575
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,145
No, of course not.

576
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,557
<i>Then relax! Heh.</i>

577
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,021
<i>We're trying to make sure you're okay.</i>

578
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,028
<i>After she searches you, it'll all be over.</i>

579
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,490
<i>Hey, do you have any older siblings</i>
<i>ever been in trouble with the law?</i>

580
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:51,699
Do you mean my brother?

581
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,584
<i>Bingo. That's right, your brother.</i>

582
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,836
<i>And has your brother told you...</i>
<i>that he's still in trouble?</i>

583
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:00,875
[door opens]

584
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,543
So now what's happening?

585
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,930
We have to strip-search Becky,
and I wanted you to come in.

586
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,092
Corporate always wants two people
for a strip search, right?

587
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,475
You think she stole something?

588
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,979
I don't know. I didn't find anything,
but it's either this, or she goes to jail.

589
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,811
- Oh, Sandra, but Becky--
- I know,

590
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,522
but I don't know what else we can do.

591
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:24,152
BECKY: I don't see how that has
anything to do with this at all.

592
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,737
This is so stupid.

593
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,618
SANDRA:
Hello, Officer. We're back.

594
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,452
<i>Great. You're really</i>
<i>helping us out here, Sandra.</i>

595
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,242
<i>I was just telling Robert</i>
<i>how lucky we all are you're there.</i>

596
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,752
<i>You're almost like a real cop.</i>

597
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,834
Ha! Well, I'm just trying to do my job.

598
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,670
<i>Well, you're doing perfect.</i>

599
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,379
SANDRA: Thank you.

600
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:48,924
<i>Okay, so I'm gonna need you</i>
<i>have her strip down now.</i>

601
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,341
<i>Look through everything.</i>

602
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,891
<i>Okay'</i>

603
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,392
Um, he says it's time to--

604
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,985
Let's just try to--

605
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,146
The faster you do it, honey,
the faster we're finished.

606
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,906
Come on.

607
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,165
<i>Okay'</i>

608
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,503
All right.

609
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:29,714
Your shoes, hon.

610
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,282
SANDRA: Okay.

611
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:01,041
Okay. I've, um--

612
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,921
I've checked the clothes,

613
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,629
and, uh, they're--they're clean.

614
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,209
What do you have?

615
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,218
SANDRA:
Everything's clean.

616
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,630
Um, I have her--

617
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,013
you know, her shirt

618
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,766
and her, uh, undershirt and her shoes

619
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:18,145
and, uh, her pants, and they're all--

620
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,772
There's nothing in them.

621
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:24,652
<i>Well, no, it's just that there isn't</i>
<i>anything you're trained to see.</i>

622
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,030
<i>Um, have you checked</i>
<i>her underwear yet?</i>

623
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,614
No, we just, uh...

624
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,285
I just looked--
I just checked her clothes.

625
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,621
<i>Okay. It's gotta be everything.</i>
<i>That's probably what's going on here.</i>

626
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:44,664
<i>Padded bras can often be</i>
<i>where thieves hide things</i>

627
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,252
<i>and--and panties, of course.</i>

628
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,840
<i>What, uh, style of panties</i>
<i>does she have?</i>

629
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,595
Uh, let's see.

630
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,678
Um, I guess cotton bikini.

631
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:56,842
<i>Hmm.</i>

632
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,640
<i>Yeah, you're gonna need</i>
<i>to take those off, all of it.</i>

633
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,946
<i>Okay'</i>

634
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,443
He wants you to--

635
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,116
He wants you to take off the--

636
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,951
take off your underwear.

637
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,870
MARTI: No, Sandra, really,
we're taking her underwear off?

638
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,254
Well, he's saying--
He's just saying,

639
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,587
uh, there's padded bras or something,
you can hide stuff in it.

640
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,559
<i>[Scoffs]</i>

641
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,447
You need to take off both.

642
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,573
<i>Okay'</i>

643
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,086
<i>Okay'</i>

644
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,795
Well, this should clear it right up,
and we'll be done with it now.

645
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,876
Okay, I'm--

646
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,795
The clothes are--

647
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:18,683
just seem fine. Everything...

648
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,180
<i>What about her rear?</i>
<i>Did you make her turn around?</i>

649
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,738
He wants you to turn around.

650
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,203
Okay, she's not hiding anything.

651
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:45,205
<i>Um, sometimes people sew</i>
<i>secret compartments in their clothes.</i>

652
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,040
<i>You can't see them</i>
<i>unless you're trained for it.</i>

653
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,172
<i>Um, we 'Il just look over it</i>
<i>before we let her go.</i>

654
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,004
<i>Here's what I'm gonna need you to do.</i>
<i>Do you have a car?</i>

655
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,588
Yes.

656
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,379
<i>Okay, I'm gonna need you</i>
<i>to take all the clothes,</i>

657
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,971
<i>along with her purse and cellphone,</i>
<i>and put them all in a bag, okay?</i>

658
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,511
<i>What kind of car do you have?</i>

659
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:07,181
Um, 2000 Subaru.
Can you get that bag for me?

660
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:12,194
<i>2000 Subaru. Okay.</i>
<i>All right, put everything in the bag,</i>

661
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,231
<i>and put the bag in the front seat</i>
<i>of your car, and leave it unlocked</i>

662
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,694
<i>so we can inspect it</i>
<i>as soon as we get there.</i>

663
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,859
Well, hang on a minute.
And, uh...

664
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,362
Why--Why would I put it in my car?

665
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,122
I mean, is she supposed
to just stay in here?

666
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,124
I'm just supposed
to stay in here like this?

667
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,206
<i>Yeah, well, hmm.</i>

668
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,086
I'm just not understanding why it has to be
in my car, though. That's the only thing.

669
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,592
<i>Yes, ma'am. I can...</i>
<i>Wait.</i>

670
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,630
Okay, so she's just gonna be in here.

671
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,012
<i>Okay, two reasons:</i>

672
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:45,429
<i>One, she won't have access to the clothes</i>
<i>to get the money back when you're not looking,</i>

673
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,892
<i>and also then we can check it,</i>
<i>and if it's clean,</i>

674
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:51,309
<i>we bring her clothes back inside with us</i>
<i>so she doesn't have to, you know,</i>

675
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,103
<i>walk through the restaurant naked</i>
<i>when we escort her out.</i>

676
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,271
<i>Um, it's just--</i>
<i>It's a standard thing.</i>

677
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,281
MARTI: I'll clock you out. Just go,

678
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,283
and I'll make sure you get paid
for today, okay?

679
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,284
- SANDRA: Okay.
- Yeah.

680
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,741
Um, they're saying...

681
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,740
that I need to put it in my car

682
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,955
so that when they get here,
they can check the stuff.

683
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,415
Your car? Sandra, when--

684
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,878
They can't give it back to the perpetrator
until they have checked it all.

685
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,795
MARTI: But, I mean, that just sound--
I don't know. I don't know.

686
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,214
Can I just keep her things
here, um, with her

687
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,224
or up front until you get here?

688
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,762
<i>Well, n--Yeah, yes. Yes, ma 'am.</i>
<i>Uh, I hear you.</i>

689
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,430
I mean, when are you coming?

690
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,644
<i>Uh, all right, look...</i>

691
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,976
<i>We don't normally share this,</i>

692
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,942
<i>but considering the time-sensitive nature</i>
<i>and my needing your help,</i>

693
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:42,576
<i>I feel like I should explain</i>
<i>the broader investigation of Rebecca.</i>

694
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,449
<i>Okay'</i>

695
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,240
<i>I'm currently investigating</i>
<i>with my team--</i>

696
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,535
<i>I'm investigating her house.</i>

697
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:52,627
- Her house?
- Yes.

698
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,834
Wait. What about my house?

699
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,498
<i>The thing is, her brother...</i>

700
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,383
Why is she talking about my house?

701
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,964
<i>Is a suspect in an investigation</i>

702
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,300
<i>over growing a large amount</i>
<i>of marijuana.</i>

703
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:07,684
<i>We believe that Rebecca may have</i>
<i>knowledge and may also be selling.</i>

704
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,102
They're saying that your house,
your brother might have someth--

705
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,518
<i>- No, please, ma'am. Ma'am! Sandra.</i>
- What?

706
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,937
<i>- This is confidential information. Okay?</i>
<i>- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

707
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,572
<i>We're hoping that if we can find</i>
<i>the money that she stole,</i>

708
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,198
<i>then we can bring her in</i>

709
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,109
<i>and get a plea confession</i>
<i>in this other situation.</i>

710
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,244
But my brother doesn't even
do anything. This is crazy.

711
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,950
<i>And here's the most important thing.</i>

712
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:28,955
[Sandra sighs]

713
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,623
<i>Okay'</i>

714
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:35,162
<i>Her clothes could have forensic proof</i>
<i>of her distributing her brother's stash.</i>

715
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,046
<i>That's why it's important</i>
<i>you take them to the car</i>

716
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,880
<i>so we have time to test them</i>
<i>before taking her away.</i>

717
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:44,546
<i>If you do this, you will build our case.</i>
<i>You understand?</i>

718
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:45,714
Yes.

719
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:00,862
[no audible dialogue]

720
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,364
CONNIE: We don't
have no pickles either.

721
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,025
Sandra! Are you or Marti
gonna come help?

722
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,444
I'm on the register by myself.

723
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,908
Okay, one of us will be right out.

724
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,118
Let me just finish this real quick.

725
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,282
CONNIE:
Oh, my God.

726
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,662
[alarm chirps off]

727
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,600
[alarm chirps on]

728
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:18,898
[alarm chirps off]

729
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,669
Sari')!-

730
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,259
CONNIE: Thank you.

731
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,469
Excuse me, miss.

732
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,805
I bought this sandwich for my daughter
with no pickles and mayo.

733
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:55,890
It's loaded with mayo.

734
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:56,974
- Okay.
- It's disgusting.

735
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,640
No problem.
Just give me one second.

736
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,819
I need a southwest ranch, no mayo.

737
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,611
Is everything okay?

738
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,027
Well, what do you think?
First the freezer thing.

739
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,037
Then I tell you we could have
a QC visit from Franchise,

740
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,665
and still we're getting the orders wrong.
Come on, Kevin.

741
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,326
I'm making the sandwich.

742
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:25,999
MARTI: wright?

743
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,760
Hey, you know Connie's by herself
at the register, right?

744
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,966
And we've got nobody
running food to drive-thru,

745
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,551
and we're completely out of bacon.

746
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,809
Well, I have Julio on drive-thru,
but you're right. It's very hectic,

747
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,562
so why don't you go out now,
and I'm gonna come as soon as I can.

748
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,563
BECKY: Bye.

749
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,395
Hello, Officer.

750
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,356
<i>Uh, did you put the clothes in the car,</i>

751
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,065
<i>the, uh, 2000 Subaru?</i>

752
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,732
Yes, I did. It's in the employee
parking in the back,

753
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:53,869
and the passenger door is unlocked.

754
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:55,578
<i>That's good. You're doing great.</i>

755
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,115
<i>Like I said before,</i>
<i>I'm lucky I have you here tonight.</i>

756
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,124
Well, thank you. Heh.

757
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,752
<i>Have you ever been involved</i>
<i>in a situation like this before?</i>

758
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,163
Oh, God, no.

759
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,502
<i>Heh. Well, you could have fooled me.</i>

760
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:10,340
<i>You're making a really difficult situation</i>
<i>run very smoothly, very professional.</i>

761
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,004
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

762
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,218
MARTI: Sandra! When we--
When are we doing the drop?

763
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,553
I can't do that and the register.

764
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,262
SANDRA: I'm coming now!

765
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,644
Actually I'm feeling like I need
to get out there

766
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,056
and do the job that Robbie
is paying me to do.

767
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,769
When did you say
you were coming back?

768
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,775
<i>Well, we're just in the middle</i>
<i>of searching the house.</i>

769
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,607
<i>I need you to sit tight with me here.</i>

770
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,112
<i>Do you have a problem doing that?</i>

771
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,023
Well, it's just that I'm needed out front.
This is our busiest time.

772
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,316
<i>Sure, sure.</i>

773
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,282
<i>Uh, really hate to do this to your night.</i>

774
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,698
<i>Do you have an employee</i>
<i>that you trust to watch her,</i>

775
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,242
<i>ideally a male for security reasons?</i>

776
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,373
Um, yeah.

777
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,708
I could get Kevin.

778
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:50,335
And I could do sandwich board,
and I could get Brie to do the, um,

779
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,377
bags going out. Okay, hold on.

780
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,923
Is--Is this really needed?
I swear I'll be okay. I--

781
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:59,059
Yes, it is needed,
until we get it figured out.

782
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,093
When are they coming?

783
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,433
I have no idea.

784
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,814
[Door closes]

785
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:09,103
[boiling]

786
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:12,113
Kevin, I need to pull you
from sandwich board.

787
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,400
Julio and Brie, cover for him.

788
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,910
I promise you I'll be right back.

789
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,960
[Low, garbled voices]

[Pen scratching]

791
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,831
Hey, all right, so what--
what is going on?

792
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,832
[Door closes]

793
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,794
There's some upsetting news
about Becky.

794
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,374
She stole from a customer,

795
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,915
and she may be in trouble
for something with her brother.

796
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,503
He's been in trouble
with the law.

797
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,839
Wait. She stole something?

798
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,345
Yes.

799
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,472
No, I--I know her brother.

800
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,850
He's not in--Wait. What?

801
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,436
I can't talk about it right now.
It's all gonna be sorted out.

802
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:29,816
What I need you for is to watch Becky
until the police get here.

803
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,156
We had to strip-search her.

804
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,908
Hello, Officer. I'm back.

805
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,198
<i>Hey, how's it going out there?</i>
<i>is it a madhouse?</i>

806
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:47,117
Oh, yes, you guessed it.
It's a madhouse.

807
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,786
Yes, I'm in the weeds.
That's the word.

808
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,955
Uh, I've gotta get back out there,

809
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,671
but I have Kevin here,
and he's gonna watch Becky.

810
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,303
<i>- Yeah. Put him on now, okay?</i>
<i>- Okay, sure.</i>

811
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,759
Uh, just so you know,
I am gonna come back in

812
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,048
and check--check on things,

813
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,842
make sure everything's all right.

814
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,601
<i>That sounds fair.</i>

815
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,518
<i>You know, you're really being very helpful.</i>

816
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,025
Well, it's no problem.

817
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,810
Urn, so here's Kevin.

818
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:18,699
This is Officer Daniels.
He'll tell you what to do.

819
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,404
Hey, they're saying that you stole
from a customer

820
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:25,914
and that your brother is arrested.

821
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,915
- What?
- What did you do?

822
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,121
I didn't--
I didn't do anything.

823
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:32,003
This is crazy. I'm naked.

824
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,083
Hello.

825
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,797
<i>Is this Kevin?</i>

826
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,086
Yeah. Yeah.

827
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,254
Kevin, this is Officer Daniels.

828
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:43,219
I'm the lead officer in the case.

829
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,224
Has your manager explained what's going on?

830
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:50,014
<i>Uh, well, she said that Becky stole something</i>
<i>and her brother's arrested.</i>

831
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,182
Sandra told you about her brother?

832
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,068
<i>Yeah--Uh, well, she said he's in trouble.</i>

833
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,070
<i>Well, what did he do?</i>

834
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,233
Yeah, well, we'll get to the brother
in a second.

835
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,027
That's really a very serious police matter.

836
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:10,542
What we are interested in
in the moment is Becky and this theft.

837
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,707
Oh, and what is the theft?

838
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:18,717
<i>Well, I have a customer here with me</i>
<i>that says her purse was taken.</i>

839
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,924
Ye--Well, you know,
I was out there the whole time,

840
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,592
and, you know, I didn't see anyone
complain about a purse being stolen.

841
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,052
<i>Yeah, no, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>You're right. Excuse me.</i>

842
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,437
Not her purse.
Uh, money from her purse.

843
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,973
She says that, uh, Becky--

844
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,016
It was on the counter, the purse,

845
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,732
and Becky stuck her hand in
and snatched it out.

846
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,568
<i>Okay, I don't understand</i>
<i>how that could be possible,</i>

847
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,449
because there were, like,
a ton of people out there.

848
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,782
Well, I don't really have the time
to debate it with you, son.

849
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:50,700
<i>I have a surveillance unit saying</i>
<i>they can corroborate the victim's story.</i>

850
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,539
<i>What our issue at hand is,</i>
<i>where is the money?</i>

851
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,748
<i>You see?</i>

852
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,881
<i>Does she have anything</i>
<i>in her pockets?</i>

853
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,343
What?

854
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:05,301
<i>What is the suspect</i>
<i>wearing at this time?</i>

855
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:12,475
I--You know, she doesn't really have
pockets to have anything in.

856
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,980
<i>And why is that?</i>

857
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,769
<i>Dude, you all strip-searched her.</i>

858
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,608
<i>She's wearing an apron right now.</i>

859
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,443
Okay. Why don't you calm down?

860
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,699
I'm gonna need you to inspect her.

861
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,781
[laughs]
What?

862
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,948
<i>Kevin, why don't you stop laughing,</i>
<i>and calm down, okay?</i>

863
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,162
W-What the fuck are you talking about?

864
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,793
<i>I am an officer of the law, okay?</i>

865
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:39,627
<i>I'm gonna need you to address me</i>
<i>as a sir, understand?</i>

866
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,006
<i>All right, Kevin...</i>

867
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,675
<i>we need to find this money.</i>

868
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,884
<i>I'm gonna need to have her</i>
<i>remove the apron,</i>

869
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,269
<i>and you search her body.</i>

870
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,977
<i>KEVIN: He's trying to get me--</i>

871
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:04,398
He's saying he wants me
to get you to take off the apron

872
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,942
and inspect your whole body.

873
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,037
I already did--

874
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,702
I already did that.
That's--

875
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,367
Yeah, bro, this is fucked.

876
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,659
I'm sorry.

877
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,329
<i>It might seem a little strange, I know,</i>

878
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,418
<i>but I'm still an officer of the law.</i>

879
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:24,460
You need to listen to me
for your own sake.

880
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,751
This is procedure.

881
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,421
Yeah, well, it's a fucked procedure.

882
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:31,057
Okay, you need to watch your mouth, son.

883
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,809
Uh, sorry.

884
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,392
Look, I gotta--
I gotta leave in a second.

885
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,978
Okay, but let me ask you one more thing.
Were you two ever an item?

886
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,360
Wha...

887
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,566
SANDRA: What are you doing?

888
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,857
You can't make me do that shit.

889
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,696
Talk to me. Come on.

890
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,037
Look, I'm not saying it was me
with the freezer,

891
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,573
but I admit that's my responsibility,

892
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,116
but that--that is not my job.

893
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,580
Jesus, Kevin, can I not count
on you for anything?

894
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,871
Becky is my friend.
When the cops come,

895
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,335
I don't want anything to do with it.

896
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:12,223
- What the hell happened?
- He didn't think it was fair.

897
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,178
SANDRA: Hello.

898
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,517
<i>Sandra, this isn't working out with Kevin.</i>

899
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:22,775
<i>I do not approve of him</i>
<i>as the main security before I arrive.</i>

900
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,106
What happened?

901
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,611
<i>Well, nothing good.</i>

902
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,148
<i>He's completely disobedient</i>
<i>and unprofessional.</i>

903
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,907
Well, he's always like that.

904
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:33,661
Is he? You have to put up with
a lot of stuff from him, huh?

905
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,289
<i>Well, I mean, he's fine.</i>
<i>I mean, he's a good kid.</i>

906
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,747
<i>You know, he %--he% fine. Just--</i>
<i>[laughs] It%--</i>

907
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:42,037
Should I have my people
start watching him?

908
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,084
<i>You think he could be wrapped up</i>
<i>in the same stuff Becky is?</i>

909
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:48,377
Oh, goodness, no. No, no, no.
Nothing like that, no.

910
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,386
<i>But he gives you hell, huh?</i>

911
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,764
Yeah, he does,
like you can't imagine.

912
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:56,017
<i>Ha ha! I'm sorry.</i>
<i>It must be a real pain.</i>

913
00:43:56,175 --> 00:44:02,353
Oh, hey, listen. Kevin said
that you told him about Becky's brother

914
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:04,563
even though I said it was confidential.

915
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,567
Oh, you know, I don't--Hmm.

916
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,190
I don't think I said much, though, did I?

917
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,155
<i>- You know, the last thing I need--</i>
- I may have mentioned it.

918
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,569
The last thing I need

919
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,534
<i>is someone on my side</i>
<i>with a big mouth, Sandra.</i>

920
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,199
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

921
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,083
<i>If you can't cooperate with me here--</i>

922
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,118
I'm sorry.

923
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,208
<i>I need to be able to trust you.</i>

924
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,587
Right.

925
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,006
I'm very sorry...

926
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,042
<i>- Just be quiet.</i>
- ...you know.

927
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:33,213
Either you need to watch her,
or we need to find someone reliable.

928
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:39,512
<i>Um, yeah, I could watch her,</i>
<i>but the thing is, it's so busy out there.</i>

929
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,055
No, no, no, I know.
You have a restaurant to run.

930
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,315
- We've asked too much of you already.
- Yeah.

931
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:49,067
Just wish I could spare one flippin' officer,
just someone to run over.

932
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,400
<i>Yeah, can't you, or--</i>

933
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:51,564
Unfortunately, no.

934
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,484
<i>It has to be someone new</i>
<i>on your end.</i>

935
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,620
Oh. Well, um, you know,

936
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:01,157
I could get Marti, but, see,
Marti's needed out there, too.

937
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,701
<i>- Right, right, right.</i>
<i>- You know?</i>

938
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,040
<i>Well, let me ask you a question.</i>

939
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,580
<i>Are you married?</i>

940
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:10,842
Uh, no, but I'm--
Heh. I'm gonna be soon.

941
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,253
You're engaged?

942
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,012
Yeah, I am.

943
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,173
<i>Oh, well, that's great. Congrats.</i>

944
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,387
Well, thanks, yeah.

945
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,675
<i>Terrific. Ha ha!</i>

946
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,721
Well, do you trust him?

947
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,560
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

948
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,895
[dog barks outside]
Well, what's he up to?

949
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,901
You think he could come by and help?

950
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,364
Um...

951
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,025
Gee, uh...

952
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,193
<i>Do you think--</i>

953
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,614
Yeah, it's a little unstandard,
I know. Jeez.

954
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,578
But it'd really help me out.

955
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,582
<i>Yeah.</i>

956
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,835
It would help you. Okay.

957
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,371
Uh, well, I would have to call him,

958
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,756
and I would just have to see if he,

959
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,759
<i>you know, could come.</i>

960
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,044
[dog barks]
Great.

961
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,929
Why don't you do that for me, then?

962
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,801
[vehicle approaches]

963
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,822
[no audible dialogue]

964
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:24,991
[laughter echoing]

965
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,635
So the officer's name is Daniels,
and we're just waiting on them.

966
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,849
So who is it again?

967
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,229
Are you drunk?

968
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:48,685
No.

969
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:51,442
I already told you it's Becky from the front.

970
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,318
That little blonde girl?

971
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,945
Yeah.

972
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,038
Becky? You remember Van, don't you?

973
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,243
BECKY: Yeah. Hey.

974
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,079
- VAN: Hey.
- Well, he's gonna sit with you

975
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,539
until they come, okay?

976
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:11,875
Do we really have to do this?

977
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,624
Honey, it's not up to me.

978
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,666
Hello, Officer?

979
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,460
- Yeah.
- I have Van here,

980
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,879
and I'm gonna hand the phone
over to him,

981
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,424
and then I'm gonna get back
out there, okay?

982
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,637
<i>That'd be great.</i>

983
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:24,971
Okay, here he is.

984
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:26,135
Here's--Here's Van.

985
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,143
Hello.

986
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:31,523
Hello. Who's this?

987
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,605
<i>This is Evan Balcer.</i>

988
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:38,274
Evan Balcer, A-L-C-E-R?

989
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,282
Do you want a Diet Coke, hon?
Diet Coke?

990
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,239
<i>- Sandra, how much longer?</i>
<i>- You're what, her boyfriend?</i>

991
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,323
- VAN: Yeah.
- SANDRA: Honey, I don't know.

992
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:44,658
<i>- Do you have a date?</i>
<i>- VAN: Not really, no.</i>

993
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,992
What do you want to drink?

994
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,657
<i>All right, Evan,</i>
<i>you got a real fine lady...</i>

995
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,075
- Diet Coke is okay.
- ...in Sandra there.

996
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,868
Thanks.

997
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,537
<i>Yeah. So what do you do?</i>

998
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,000
<i>Y-You're a general contractor?</i>

999
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,380
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1000
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,375
You don't work at the ChickWich?

1001
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,793
- No.
- Not even part-time?

1002
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,802
- Nah.
- [laughs]

1003
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,679
<i>And, uh, what was</i>
<i>your whereabouts tonight?</i>

1004
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:03,714
What were you doing?

1005
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,428
Uh, it was a long day at work,

1006
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,765
so I just hung out with some buddies
at their--their house, you know.

1007
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,521
<i>Oh, man, you got dragged in here, huh?</i>

1008
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,805
I did, yeah. [laughs]

1009
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,351
<i>Well, get used to it. That's the way</i>
<i>it's gonna be once you get married.</i>

1010
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:16,986
They never let you out.

1011
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,693
All right, Evan.

1012
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,450
You ready to do this? She fill you in
on everything we need to do here?

1013
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,906
Not really, no.

1014
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,117
She, uh, she said I just
had to sit here and wait.

1015
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,953
<i>Well, I bet she told you</i>
<i>Becky stole money.</i>

1016
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,083
Pardon me?

1017
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,915
<i>She told you Becky stole the money?</i>

1018
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:33,919
Right.

1019
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,671
<i>BOY-</i>

1020
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:40,006
Well, I'm in charge of the crime scene
and everything that happens here,

1021
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,215
and you're gonna assist me, okay?

1022
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,431
I--I guess so. [chuckles]

1023
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,556
<i>Okay'</i>

1024
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:50,345
And the first thing we need to do
is find that money she took.

1025
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:51,975
<i>Okay'</i>

1026
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,890
<i>I'm gonna need you to inspect her.</i>

1027
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,275
<i>Does she still have that apron on?</i>

1028
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,398
Yep.

1029
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,155
Yeah, why don't we start by...

1030
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:03,111
having her take that off.

1031
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:06,910
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1032
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,833
He says you gotta take off the apron.

1033
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:13,959
What?

1034
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:14,960
<i>Oh, and, Evan,</i>

1035
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,215
if she won't take it off I'm gonna
need you to take it from her.

1036
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,091
We gotta find the money that you took.

1037
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,594
Someone else already
made me take it off.

1038
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,878
I'm naked. The--

1039
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,718
<i>And we have to find that money.</i>

1040
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,883
<i>Did she-Has she taken it off yet?</i>

1041
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:33,429
No. She said somebody already asked her
and that she doesn't have the money.

1042
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,439
She's naked.
[chuckles]

1043
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:37,316
[Daniels laughs]

1044
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,022
You believe everything a thief says?

1045
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,610
Evan, you're a grown man.

1046
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,488
You think a naked girl doesn't
have a place to hide money?

1047
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,240
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1048
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,072
- Well, I just--I don't--
- Yeah.

1049
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,953
<i>I want you to see her without that apron.</i>

1050
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,739
<i>I'm gonna need you to describe her body.</i>

1051
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:54,910
[door opens]
BECKY: Hey, Sandra,

1052
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,167
can't we have Marti come back here?

1053
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,957
Honey, why are you making this
more difficult than it has to be?

1054
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,295
Can you hold on a second, Officer?

1055
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,459
All right.

1056
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,301
Is this okay to be doing?

1057
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:09,431
What do you mean?

1058
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,059
I don't know. It--I don't get it.

1059
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,185
I mean, you gotta find the money?

1060
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,388
Well, yeah, of course.

1061
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,522
Is that what he said?

1062
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,523
Yeah.

1063
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,979
What is he saying?

1064
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:22,694
Jesus, Van.

1065
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,696
How many beers have you had?

1066
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,528
Let me talk to him.

1067
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,534
Hello, Officer?

1068
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,569
Yes.

1069
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,329
How--How's he doing?

1070
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:36,413
<i>Oh, he's doing great, just really great,</i>
<i>almost as sweet and helpful as you.</i>

1071
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,373
[laughs]
Uh, so he's better than Kevin.

1072
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:39,708
- He's, uh--
- Oh, yeah.

1073
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,213
Yeah. He's not giving you any trouble?

1074
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,795
No, no, no.
We were doing just great.

1075
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:44,925
<i>Okay, great.</i>

1076
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,963
Well, then, I'm gonna go ahead
and hand the phone back to Van,

1077
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,755
and I'm gonna get back out there.

1078
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:51,299
<i>- Okay, you do that.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

1079
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,482
Yeah, this is Van.

1080
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:01,813
BECKY: Can't just, like, you or Marti--

1081
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:03,398
Can I come sit with you guys out there...

1082
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,983
<i>- Is Sandra still there?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1083
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,738
...where I can wait or something
in the employee area?

1084
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,025
Well, honey, what are you gonna do,
walk through the dining room?

1085
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,613
<i>She's talking to Becky or...?</i>

1086
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,494
- This isn't going to go on much longer.
- Yeah.

1087
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:15,657
Here. Have something to drink, okay?
You'll be all right?

1088
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,167
<i>Yeah. Well, you know,</i>
<i>these are sensitive matters.</i>

1089
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,419
<i>It's probably better</i>
<i>to let them talk about it</i>

1090
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,798
<i>before we, uh,</i>
<i>do what we need to do here.</i>

1091
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,634
[door closes]
- Okay.

1092
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,092
Is Sandra still there?

1093
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,303
<i>Y-Yeah, she left.</i>

1094
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,598
Is she coming back any time soon?

1095
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,933
I don't know.

1096
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,890
- I don't think so.
- 'Kay.

1097
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,230
Then you need
to tell Becky to take it off.

1098
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,066
And, look, I work with
troubled teens all the time.

1099
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,230
There's usually some resistance,

1100
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:51,617
<i>but... usually they just want to help.</i>

1101
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,028
<i>They want to do the right thing, so just--</i>

1102
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,288
<i>This is what works.</i>
<i>Be stern with her.</i>

1103
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,290
Don't give her a choice.

1104
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,621
Go ahead.

1105
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,043
Please, don't. This is craz--

1106
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,798
Just don't make me do this.

1107
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,879
This is crazy.

1108
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,716
<i>Let me talk to Becky.</i>

1109
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,013
He wants to talk to you.

1110
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:18,686
BECKY: Hello.

1111
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:22,898
So I want you to do me a favor

1112
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,401
and look around at where you are.

1113
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,896
That's where you are.

1114
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,784
<i>Where we are is at your house,</i>

1115
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:36,445
<i>searching it for your brother's drugs.</i>

1116
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,580
My brother doesn't do drugs.

1117
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,083
<i>Enough. Enough.</i>

1118
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,293
<i>Shut up.</i>

1119
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,757
We have you with witnesses
stealing from the restaurant.

1120
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,543
You aren't cooperating.

1121
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,963
You aren't helping us
conduct our investigation.

1122
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,722
It's not good.

1123
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:02,226
All right, looks like
we're gonna have to take you in.

1124
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,643
<i>They'll look at your criminal record,</i>

1125
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:11,318
<i>determine how many hours</i>
<i>you're gonna spend there in the jail.</i>

1126
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,482
I don't have a criminal record.

1127
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:19,364
I'm just saying they'll look
at your criminal record or lack of,

1128
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,749
look at your papers,

1129
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:25,748
decide how many hours
you'll spend in jail. Okay?

1130
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,214
<i>I mean, they are gonna haul you in.</i>

1131
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:36,847
<i>They'll look at how you</i>
<i>cooperated here, today.</i>

1132
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,679
<i>I mean, all this is being recorded.</i>

1133
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:41,598
<i>You understand?</i>

1134
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,064
[sighs]

1135
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,574
Yeah, I understand.

1136
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,359
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1137
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:01,076
But, sir, why?

1138
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,660
<i>Why? Why are you going to jail?</i>

1139
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:09,170
<i>Because you're the one</i>
<i>that's causing all the problems.</i>

1140
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:17,430
<i>Now, if you want this over with</i>
<i>sooner rather than later,</i>

1141
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:21,808
<i>you'll allow the person that I authorized</i>

1142
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:25,016
to inspect you, to search you.

1143
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:26,772
And then, maybe then...

1144
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,685
you'll have a chance of getting out of this.

1145
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,117
You understand what I'm saying?

1146
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,699
You can go to jail,
or you can let this guy inspect you.

1147
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:44,331
You can go to jail, or you can
let this guy inspect you.

1148
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,709
That's it, two choices.

1149
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:51,955
<i>- You're gonna do this?</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

1150
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,749
You're gonna take off the apron?

1151
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:58,550
Yeah.

1152
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,305
You're gonna take it off?

1153
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,142
Yes.

1154
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,598
Great. Thank you.

1155
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,351
You're doing great.

1156
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,560
So just take off the apron
and give the phone back to Van, okay?

1157
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,911
This is Van.

1158
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,042
<i>How'd that work?</i>
<i>She take off the apron?</i>

1159
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,415
She is now.

1160
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,625
<i>Well, what does her chest look like?</i>

1161
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:41,259
Well, she's covering it with the apron.

1162
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:45,434
<i>I thought you said she took it off.</i>
<i>Take it from her.</i>

1163
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:53,689
He says I gotta take the apron from you.

1164
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,625
<i>How big are her nipples?</i>

1165
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,708
<i>[scoffs]</i>

1166
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,839
Why? I mean--

1167
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:17,841
<i>You're my eyes on the ground.</i>

1168
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,298
<i>Anything that can corroborate</i>
<i>the witness' testimony.</i>

1169
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,509
<i>I just need to know</i>
<i>any identifying marks, scars, tattoos.</i>

1170
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:25,674
Yeah, but--

1171
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,343
[laughs nervously]

1172
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,808
You gotta lower your arms.

1173
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,155
I don't know. I--

1174
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:42,988
<i>Average, I guess.</i>

1175
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,662
All right, I need you
to do me a favor.

1176
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,823
We need to find out
if she's hiding any money up there,

1177
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:53,995
so I want you to tell her
to turn around and bend over.

1178
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,163
Why?

1179
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,003
<i>That's just a standard cavity search.</i>

1180
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:00,008
<i>You've probably seen that on TV,</i>

1181
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,919
<i>at the airport even sometimes, just to...</i>

1182
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,052
All right.

1183
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,805
<i>See if she's holding anything</i>
<i>in any of her, uh, orifices.</i>

1184
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,090
All right. All right.

1185
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,600
He says you have to turn around
and you have to bend over

1186
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:16,358
so I can see if there's
anything up in there.

1187
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,398
Turn around.

1188
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:23,191
<i>You know, it might help if you just--</i>
<i>you make her call you sir</i>

1189
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,609
<i>and tell her to hold her ankles.</i>

1190
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:26,701
Why?

1191
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,487
<i>Well, she's gonna respect the authority.</i>

1192
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:31,908
<i>If not, she's just gonna run</i>
<i>ramshod all over you.</i>

1193
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,581
He says you have to call me sir

1194
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:40,041
so that when I ask you to do something,
I know you're gonna do it.

1195
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:42,209
All right?

1196
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:43,628
[faintly] Yes, sir.

1197
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,382
<i>What's, uh--</i>

1198
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,097
<i>What's that look like?</i>
<i>Is she shaved?</i>

1199
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,637
I don't know. I guess, uh, she's--

1200
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:57,229
It's trimmed, I guess.

1201
00:57:57,391 --> 00:58:00,315
It's shaved. I just--
it's just been a couple days.

1202
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,979
She said it's actually shaved.

1203
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,648
Who said? She said that?

1204
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:05,782
<i>Yeah.</i>

1205
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:06,783
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1206
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:07,909
Nice work, Evan.

1207
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,070
We need to deputize you, huh?

1208
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,535
Can I give her the--the apron back now?

1209
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:17,874
<i>No.</i>

1210
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,583
Boy, it really must be stuck up there.

1211
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:27,300
Okay, um, we have a special
procedure that we do in this case.

1212
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,591
Uh, have her turn around.

1213
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,225
<i>She is around.</i>

1214
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:34,261
<i>Okay'</i>

1215
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:37,435
Yeah, I'm gonna need you to have her
do jumping jacks...

1216
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,233
to try and shake it out.

1217
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,062
Huh?

1218
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,981
Have her jog in place or do jumping jacks

1219
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:49,027
to see if we can get the money dislodged.

1220
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,831
I don't know.

1221
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:57,960
<i>What were you doing tonight?</i>
<i>Have a few beers?</i>

1222
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,870
You weren't driving, were you?

1223
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,630
[sighs]

1224
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,836
<i>[Sighs] Jesus Christ, Evan,</i>

1225
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:07,048
<i>we need that money as soon</i>
<i>as possible, understand?</i>

1226
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:10,301
He says you gotta do jumping jacks.

1227
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,886
What?

1228
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,393
VAN: To shake it out.

1229
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,563
This is so stupid.

1230
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,565
I know.

1231
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,101
<i>We need that money.</i>

1232
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:25,020
<i>I don't want you</i>
<i>to have to answer for it, too.</i>

1233
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,989
- VAN: Just do it. Just--
- [Becky sniffles]

1234
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,158
[sighs]

1235
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,000
[feet thumping]

1236
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:49,344
[timer beeps]

1237
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,339
All right, my front line,
get your drawers ready!

1238
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,884
Drop in two minutes.

1239
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,520
Dude, I just texted my friend,

1240
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,808
and he thinks her brother's
not even in town right now.

1241
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,226
It's just messed up.

1242
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:08,363
I don't know. Go on back there if you want,
but I ain't messin' with no cops.

1243
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,071
That fall under shit
that ain't none of my business.

1244
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,361
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1245
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,790
What's it look like from there, Evan?

1246
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:24,713
<i>What's it like to have</i>
<i>a front-row seat to the show?</i>

1247
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,381
Come on.

1248
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,542
[Door opens]

1249
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,302
SANDRA:
How's everybody doing in here?

1250
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,758
[Door closes]

1251
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,049
Nothing.

1252
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:36,846
What?

1253
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,138
We're just waiting. That's all.

1254
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:44,524
What?! What are you waiting for?
I don't underst--

1255
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:48,896
W-When are they coming?

1256
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:49,938
VAN: I don't know.

1257
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:51,822
Well, let me talk to him, then.

1258
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,485
Let me talk to him.
Give me the phone.

1259
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:58,284
Hello, Officer Daniels.
How is it going?

1260
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:01,370
<i>Oh, great. How you doing?</i>
<i>You busy out there?</i>

1261
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,035
Yeah, I'm busy as ever.

1262
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:04,578
It's a great night. Uh...

1263
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,417
BECKY:
Sandra, you gotta help me.

1264
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,923
Why are you talking to me?

1265
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,584
Can you see I'm on the phone?
Sit down!

1266
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:15,430
I have to get back out there
to the restaurant.

1267
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:20,140
Do you, uh--ls Van still--
still being a sweetie?

1268
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:21,645
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>He b-Heb been great.</i>

1269
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:24,682
Oh, good. So I'm gonna
give him back the phone.

1270
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:25,895
Sounds good.

1271
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,276
- I'll see you when you come.
- Okay.

1272
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,358
Sandra, please, I can't do this.

1273
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,648
What are you--
What are you doing, honey?

1274
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:33,815
- They can't make me do this.
- Stop talking.

1275
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:34,824
You're gonna be fine.

1276
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:36,985
Hello. This is Van.

1277
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:38,995
<i>Hey, Van...</i>

1278
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:41,327
[door closes]
sounds like Sandra's running around

1279
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,706
like a chicken
with her head cut off, huh?

1280
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:43,992
<i>I--I guess so.</i>

1281
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,536
Yes, I'm sure it's busy in there.

1282
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,922
Listen, I'm not sure when
you guys are coming.

1283
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:51,542
Is Sandra still in there?

1284
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,880
She just left.
[beep]

1285
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,966
<i>WOMAN: You have one minute</i>

<i>- Shit.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

1287
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,013
<i>Are you coming?</i>

1288
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:58,799
Fuck me. God damn it. Hello?

1289
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,182
Shit.

1290
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:01,969
Fuck.

1291
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,934
Hello? Officer Daniels,
are you there?

1292
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,565
Hey. I got a situation here
at Rebecca's house, Evan.

1293
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:08,976
If I lose you, uh...

1294
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,189
Do you want to call back?

1295
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:13,356
<i>You have 30 seconds left on this card.</i>

1296
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,522
<i>VAN: Hello?</i>

1297
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:29,247
Hey, uh, what the hell
is he doing back there?

1298
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,047
It's her fiancé.
They're getting married.

1299
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:34,050
Yeah, well, it's kinda fucked up
that he's back there alone with Becky,

1300
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:36,007
especially since she's half-naked like that.

1301
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:39,093
I told her I didn't like the idea
of taking the clothes out to the car.

1302
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,725
Yeah, well, I told her
I didn't like the whole thing.

1303
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,226
Th-Those cops are fucked.

1304
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:44,386
Yeah.

1305
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,521
<i>- DANIELS: Okay, I'm back.</i>
<i>- Hello?</i>

1306
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,057
<i>Hello? You there?</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1307
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:49,437
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Sorry about that.</i>

1308
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,146
<i>Had to deal with inspection of her home.</i>

1309
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,777
<i>Things just got very serious over here.</i>

1310
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,062
So where were we?

1311
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,981
Did you scold her
for her insubordination yet?

1312
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,899
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

1313
01:02:58,066 --> 01:02:59,488
Well, you gotta get on that.

1314
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:00,903
I don't know what you're talking about.

1315
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:03,948
<i>I need you to give her a spanking</i>
<i>'cause she was talking smack to Sandra,</i>

1316
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,583
<i>but I need to explain it to her first.</i>

1317
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,003
<i>- [sighs]</i>
<i>- You know?</i>

1318
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,162
<i>[scoffs]</i>

1319
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,424
You mean...

1320
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:17,801
<i>- Can you tell her that?</i>
- ...actually do that?

1321
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:19,963
<i>- Yeah. I need you to do that...</i>
- Yeah, I can tell--

1322
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,131
<i>but I need to tell her that.</i>

1323
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,221
He says you were disobeying

1324
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:25,977
because you were talking
to Sandra like that.

1325
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,104
Can you put her on for me?

1326
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:30,436
<i>VAN: He wants to talk to you.</i>

1327
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,228
<i>BECKY: I didn't do anything, sir.</i>

1328
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:38,194
<i>Didn't we talk about you</i>
<i>going easy on Sandra?</i>

1329
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:42,361
<i>That all this would be hard on her?</i>
<i>Did we not?</i>

1330
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,029
Yes, sir.

1331
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,412
<i>What about me, Rebecca?</i>

1332
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:48,746
<i>Do you even understand</i>
<i>how hard this is on me?</i>

1333
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,081
You think I like situations like this?

1334
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:54,248
No. I don't. Nobody does.

1335
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:59,341
<i>Would you agree with me</i>
<i>that you're disobeying?</i>

1336
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,425
<i>You'd agree with me, right?</i>

1337
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:05,384
I guess. Yes, sir.

1338
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,053
<i>Good. Then you'd be right.</i>

1339
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,472
What used to happen
when you've been bad?

1340
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:13,642
When you were a kid,
you'd get a spanking, right?

1341
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,566
<i>BECKY: Okay.</i>

1342
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:20,357
Evan will have to spank you, right?

1343
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,900
For being bad.

1344
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,194
<i>And then you can do</i>
<i>something nice for him.</i>

1345
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,534
<i>Can you do that?</i>
<i>Can you take your punishment</i>

1346
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:30,041
<i>and do something nice</i>
<i>for his assisting the police?</i>

1347
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,077
Yes, sir.

1348
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,540
<i>Good girl.</i>

1349
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,673
Now I want you to give him
back the phone.

1350
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,184
It's Van.

1351
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:49,219
<i>Evan, you there?</i>

1352
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,228
Yes.

1353
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:54,563
<i>Okay, well, I talked to her, and she</i>
<i>understands she did something wrong,</i>

1354
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:58,187
<i>and you're gonna need to spank her.</i>
<i>Can you do that?</i>

1355
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,028
- Yeah. I can do that.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1356
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:10,081
<i>But, hey, I don't want you</i>
<i>to just pat her, you know?</i>

1357
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,039
This isn't, uh, patty-cakes here.

1358
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,708
I really want you to--

1359
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:21,752
I want you to send a message
that this behavior will not be tolerated.

1360
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:22,919
<i>VAN: All right.</i>

1361
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,848
Uh, hard and long,

1362
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,390
for a really long time.

1363
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:29,972
<i>I don't want you to stop</i>

1364
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:33,480
<i>until you know that you got</i>
<i>your message across.</i>

1365
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,436
<i>Oh, and lay the phone real close,</i>

1366
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,521
<i>real close so I can hear.</i>

1367
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,614
You want me to, um,
lay the phone on her back

1368
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,536
so you can hear?

1369
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,117
Yeah, that's an excellent idea.

1370
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:56,002
Just--Yeah, lay the phone
right on her back.

1371
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:57,162
<i>All right.</i>

1372
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,419
<i>All right, what?</i>

1373
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,923
All right...

1374
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,223
sir.

1375
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,634
Good.

1376
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,020
<i>Okay, and then we'll have her</i>
<i>do something...</i>

1377
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:17,228
<i>really nice for you,</i>
<i>thank you for all your...</i>

1378
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,813
<i>help and patience in this matter, okay?</i>

1379
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,649
- Mmmmm.
<i>- You go ahead now.</i>

1380
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:28,110
So he says you have
to bend over my lap.

1381
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,827
Come on.

1382
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:39,913
Come on.

1383

So what's going on
with the situation in back?

1390
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,318
Just waiting for them to come.

1391
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,319
What's Van doing?

1392
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,947
He's guarding her till they get here,
just sitting back there.

1393
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:51,656
Well, when it slows down out here,
you want me to go sit with her?

1394
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,821
Maybe. We'll see.

1395
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:56,865
Hi! Can I take your order?

What are you doing back?

I thought I'd stop in for one

HAROLD:
What is all this now, ma'am?

1434
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:13,997
Uh, Becky stole something,

1435
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:17,337
and we have to watch her
until the police come.

1436
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,592
Becky stole?

1437
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,127
Yeah, Becky stole something,

1438
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:22,217
and we had to strip-search her,

1439
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,257
and the regional manager is involved,

1440
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,767

- Hello.

Right. Okay, well, here's--

1454

Why don't you just let me talk to Harold
while you take care of that.

Okay. Here's Harold.

1456

you need to know.

How is she dressed?

1462
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,733
Heh. Pardon?

That's right. Why?

1465
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,613
<i>Harold, first thing we're gonna</i>
<i>have to do is take that off.</i>

1466
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:27,028
<i>She stole money,</i>
<i>and we're gonna need to find it.</i>

1467

<i>- Mister...</i>
<i>- She hid it up her--</i>

1468
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:30,072
I don't know who you are,

1469
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:33,876
but I don't think it's right to see
a lady like this in the buff.

1470
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:35,378
<i>Well, it's an investigation.</i>

1471
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:36,958
<i>Harold, listen to me.</i>

1472
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:40,921
<i>As an officer of the law,</i>
<i>I'm gonna need you to inspect her.</i>

1473
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,255
<i>It's not your decision.</i>

1474
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,637
Well, I'll be damned if it isn't.

1477
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:50,013
Harold, what's--
What are you doing out here?

1478
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,769
You're supposed to be in there with Becky.

1479
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,805
That man's asking me
to do things that ain't right.

1480
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:55,393
What?

1481
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:59,060
He's asking me to take her apron off
and look at her--

1482
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:00,273
- It ain't right...
- What are you talking about?

1483
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:01,278

1489
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:16,873
Um, my employee that stole.

1490
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:19,539

You haven't been talking to Officer Daniels
on the other line?

1494

<i>I haven't talked to anybody today.</i>

Um, yeah, well...

1625
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:20,538
He had an answer every time
that I asked a question.

1626

And everything about it
was strange to me,

1627

he always had an answer.

that was played,

1640

Becky told you
that she didn't want you to do it.

1644

It wasn't a prank to her.
She begged you to stop.

01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,080
if-if you don't mind the heat, isn't it?

1674
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:05,289
[Both chuckle]

1675
01:26:05,452 --> 01:26:07,500
Uh, yeah, yeah.

1676
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:10,507
Well, yeah, I had a cousin
who went there,

1677
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:13,886
and, uh, the humidity,
I think, is very high.

1678
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,261
Uh-huh.

1679
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,763
Yeah.
