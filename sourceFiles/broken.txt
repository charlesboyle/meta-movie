00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,903
♫ Blue is where l want to be

♫ When I'm down I'm in the sea

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,038
♫ Looking up at monsters in the clouds

7
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,252
♫ Red's the colour when you're dead

8
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,672
♫ If you find me gone, I'm just in bed

9
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:16,093

♫ Got feet and l got wings

13
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,283
♫ To carry me back home

14
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,913
♫ To my house that's made of bricks

15
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,083
♫ Well, that's just such a fix

16
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,879
♫ To ever hold me down

17
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,884
♫ White is what I was to start

18
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:00,262
♫ Broken by my open heart

19
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,139

00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,783
(Kasia laughs) No, no. Stop.

180
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,326
No.

181
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,036
(Skunk) Gross.

182
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,704
(Jed) Nice move.

183
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,039
(Kasia whispers) Stop, stop.

184
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,373
Hi, guys.

185
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,126
(Mike) Come on. Look, this is a six.
(Skunk) That's cheating.

186
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,629
(Jed) What? Stop doing that.
(Mike) This is a nine. Come on.

187
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,380
(Skunk) Mike.
(Mike) Yeah?

188
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,050
(Skunk) When you're a teacher. . .
(Jed) Blue.

189
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,010
. . .will you still bring us treats
and stuff?

190
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,055
Uh, no.
That's all gonna have to end, Skunk.

191
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,306
Really?

192
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,810
Well, you see, the relationship
between student and teacher

193
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,729
-is by its nature. . .
-(Jed) You won't be our teacher.

194
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,397
-Well, you never know, Jed.
-Mike.

195
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,566
-By nature is what?
-Well, it's adversarial.

196
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,151
-What does that mean?
-(whispers) Go.

197
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,738
Well, it means that it'll be my job
to see you as the enemy.

198
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,574
-He's full of shit.
-Somebody only worthy of my contempt.

199
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,992
-(Kasia) Mike!
-And you'll begin to see me

200
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,077
-that way too.
-Mike!

201
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,579
-Whose go is it?
-(all) Yours.

202
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,914
Okay.

203
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,583
-l won't ever see you that way, Mike.
-(Jed, sarcasticaIIy) Aw.

204
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,919
-lt's 'cause you're in love with him.
-No, l'm not!

205
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,212
(Mike) Guys, guys.

206
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,423
ln my experience, the person
who brings up the subject of love

207
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,677
is more often than not
the person who is in love.

208
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,095
-Really?
-Shut up.

209
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,180
-You're blushing, Jed.
-(laughing)

210
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,766
What about you two? Are you in love?

211
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,768
Mike and l? Of course.

212
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,937
Then why aren't you married yet?

213
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,358
(Jed) That's the question.

214
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,615
-(snapping)
-(beeping)

215
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,701
(Kasia) All good?
(Skunk) Uh-huh.

216
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,370
-Night.
-Night.

217
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,289
Close your curtains.

218
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,299
(Archie) Have you called Dr Curtis?

219
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,760
Oh, yes, but he says, uh,
he can't act in any way

220
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,221
without Rick's permission.

221
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,640
-Which he won't give.
-This is what l'm saying.

222
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,434
He won't come out
of his bedroom, Archie.

223
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,812
(Mr BuckIey) Janet sits outside
his door aII day

224
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,772
trying to taIk to him, and nothing.

225
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:09,324
(sighs) l'm sorry to drop in on you
like this, out of the blue,

226
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,117
but l just. . .
You know, l just thought. . .

227
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,828
l thought, "Well, Archie, he's a. . .
a solicitor and. . ."

228
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,664
So you want. . .
you want to take this matter further?

229
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,292
You want to make this a legal matter?

230
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,753
Bloody legal action?
No, no, no. Forget it. Uh. . .

231
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,671
l don't want anything more
to do with the bastard.

232
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,174
-Oswald?
-Yes.

233
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,842
Why not?

234
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,012
Because l'm scared of him.

235
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,265
l'm just really bloody scared of him.

236
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,686
(Mrs BuckIey) And you went
under the water.

237
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,313
Five years old.

238
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:47,111
And your father ran so fast
across those stones to get you.

239
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,280
And he got you.

240
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,617
He saved you.

241
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,207
-And then. . .
-(doorbell chiming)

242
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,808
Hello, Mrs Buckley. ls Rick in?

243
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,476
Why?

244
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,186
Don't know.

245
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,522
Just thought he might like
to hang out or something.

246
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,233
He's ill, love. He can't come out.

247
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,443
Oh. . .

248
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,946
-Okay, well. . .
-Goodbye now, love.

249
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,614
Bye.

250
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,077
(door closes)

251
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,710
(keys jangling)

252
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,717
(footsteps approaching)

253
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,511
(Mrs Buckley) And anyway. . .

254
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,599
Then we bought you
that Matchbox tank.

255
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,644
Do you remember?
For being so brave.

256
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,148
And you tried to give it
to your dad

257
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,817
because he'd cut his feet up

258
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,737
running over those stones.

259
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,698
So kind, you were, so. . .

260
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,373
l mean,
what five-year-old in the world. . .

261
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,419
would have done that, huh?

262
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,639
Um. . .

263
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,646
(mumbling) Stupid.

264
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,618
-Hello, Archie.
-Bob.

265
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,536
What can l do for you?

266
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,207
l was wondering
if we could have a little chat.

267
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,541
-Chat?
-Yeah.

268
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,126
Yeah, absolutely.

269
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,383
Okay, well, um. . .

270
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,432
l know things have been. . .tough for you
since Barbara passed away, you know?

271
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,102
For you and for the girls, you know?
And what with. . .

272
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,437
everything that's
been happening lately. . .

273
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:30,149
l just. . . l wanted you to know that,
you know, if ever you wanted to talk. . .

274
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,359
-Talk?
-Yeah.

275
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,777
Fuck off, Archie, will you?

276
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,991
All right. Um. . .

277
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,788
Well, what l wanted
to ask you was, uh. . .

278
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:49,210
if you could ask your girls
to give the Buckleys a break.

279
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,879
They've been having
a tough time of it lately.

280
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,047
-Have they?
-Yeah.

281
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,925
That's really awful. (sniffs)

282
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,641
When was the last time
you cried, Archie?

283
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,185
-Cried?
-Yeah.

284
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,646
-l don't know. Why?
-'Cause the next time you will

285
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,232
is the next time that you criticise
my girls. . . No, hang on.

286
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,734
. . . in any fucking way
whatsoever, all right?

287
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,319
They're out of bounds.

288
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,573
And if Buckley can't take
a little friendly fucking ribbing,

289
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,909
then he's more of a pathetic prick
than l thought he was.

290
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,036
Now, l'm having my dinner, mate,
so if you don't mind fucking off.

291
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,205
Thanks.

292
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,051
(Jed) You know what'd make it better?

293
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,344
A Blu-ray player.

294
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,637
Yeah, well,
you can't have everything, Jed.

295
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,055
No, l'm just saying.

296
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,600
l got you that ashtray, didn't l?

297
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,852
That's what l'm saying, Skunk.
lt's brilliant.

298
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,937
lt's the best ever.

299
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,610
-Be great if we never had to go back.
-What, to school?

300
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,819
Yeah.

301
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,655
l don't know. l'm kind of
looking forward to going, actually.

302
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,074
Oh, first year.

303
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,159
What?

304
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,911
Sometimes when you're walking
down the corridors,

305
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,787
-the older kids will punch you.
-What?

306
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,080
ln the stomach.

307
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,248
(Skunk shrieks)

308
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,333
(Dillon) ldiots!

309
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,001
-Watch where you're going, will you?
-(Jed) Listen, mate,

310
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,920
it's not our fault
you can't ride your bike.

311
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,840
lt's not my bike.
And l can ride it. Watch this.

312
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,175
Whose is it, then?

313
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,470
-That is a travesty.
-(Dillon) Hang on, hang on.

314
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,138
Right, you ready?

315
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,891
(laughs)

316
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,684
Hey! You thieving little spastic!

317
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,769
l'll kill you !

318
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,355
l'll kill you ! l'll bloody kill you !

319
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,149
Twats!

320
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,194
-Yes!
-What the fucking hell?

321
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,908
Fucking hell ! (gags)

322
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,833
So who do you live with, then?

323
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,460
My auntie.

324
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,046
-Where's your dad?
-He's dead.

325
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,173
Dead?

326
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,802
He was killed in a fire,
along with my mum.

327
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,763
-That's terrible.
-And my sister.

328
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,020
l don't give a shit.
l was only five or six at the time.

329
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,939
(Skunk) Oh.

330
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,441
(Jed) Wow. Cool.

331
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,698
Our mum ran away
with an accountant from Birmingham.

332
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,951
Yeah? So are you a lesbian?

333
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,536
No.

334
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,037
You look like a lesbian.

335
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,123
What does a lesbian look like?

336
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,668
Kind of ugly.

337
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,086
(Jed) Oi, Skunk!

338
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,631
(Mrs Buckley) No, but just stop
them taking him.

339
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,216
Dave, why don't you
just go in there and do something?

340
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,635
-(Mr Buckley) Calm down. l'm really. . .
-Sort it out, for Christ's sake.

341
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,178
(Sunrise) He's coming !

342
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,180
(Mrs Buckley) Rick, Rick.
You've done nothing wrong, Rick.

343
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,974
Here he is.

344
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,934
(Saskia) Get the straitjacket.
(Mrs Buckley) Stop it!

345
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,770
(Sunrise) Lock him up!
(Mrs Buckley) Rick! Rick! l love you.

346
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,856
Put him in a padded fucking cell,
the psycho.

347
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,025
(Sunrise) Cut his knob off.

348
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,986
(Saskia) Feed it to him.

349
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,030
(Sunrise) His donkey fucking knob!

350
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,906
Hee-haw, hee-haw!

351
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,117
(Saskia laughs)

352
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,994
(Kasia) Jed.

353
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,497
(Jed) Has Rick gone mental?
(Kasia) Shut up and go inside.

354
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,999
Where are you going?

355
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,959
(Jed) He's coming in to play Xbox.
(Kasia) No, he's not.

356
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,420
Bye-bye.
Off you go back to your halting site.

357
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,214
(Dillon) l ain't no pikey.
(Jed) That's racist, Kasia.

358
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,383
-Sorry, mate. She's Polish.
-(Kasia) Skunk!

359
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,143
-Bye.
-You don't look like a lesbian.

360
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,354
No? So why'd you say l did, then?

361
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,565
-l don't know.
-Because l'm ugly?

362
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,649
No, you're not.

363
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,027
You're really pretty.

364
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,406
-Am l?
-(laughs) No. You're ugly.

365
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,241
(DiIIon) See ya.

366
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,619
(Mr Buckley) Well, sitting outside his
bedroom door all day's not gonna help.

367
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,787
lt's that kind of babying. . .

368
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,996
-(Mrs Buckley) Babying?
-Yes.

369
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,540
You don't know whether you're coming
or going. Look at yourself.

370
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,626
When did you last have a shower?

371
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,879
-Our son is sick.
-Give him a break.

372
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,132
-Our son needs to know l'm here!
-Calm down. . . Well, l'll. . .

373
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,051
Please, don't. Please, don't.

374
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,053
(Mr BuckIey)
Rick, get out of this room !

375
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,305
Rick, open this door.
lf you don't open this door. . .

376
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,724
l'm. . . Rick, l'm coming in, you. . .

377
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,893
-(tearing)
-Ah !

378
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,446
(Mr BuckIey)
l asked the doctor they had there

379
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,449
how long they could keep him in,
and, uh. . .

380
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,953
he said, indefinitely.

381
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,872
-Right.
-ls that true?

382
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,625
Well, um. . .

383
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,879
lf a patient's been sectioned,

384
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:48,968
they have the right to keep them in
as long as they see fit.

385
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,970
(Mr BuckIey) I see.

386
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,349
(Archie) I'm sorry, Dave.

387
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,567
(Skunk) What's it like?

388
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,985
l don't know. l don't know.

389
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,778
ls it like
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest?

390
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,363
(moaning)

391
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,032
-Stop it!
-Wait, hang on. You saw that?

392
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,285
(Jed) Kasia fell asleep
in front of the telly one night.

393
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,745
Oh, my God. Was she drinking?

394
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,622
-(tuts)
-What? l'm joking.

395
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,499
-Ooh.
-(Skunk) They cut a part

396
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,667
-of his brain out.
-(Mike) Who?

397
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,586
-McMurphy.
-(moaning)

398
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,837
-Stop it!
-(Kasia) Jed.

399
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,506
(Mike) Look, listen, that is not
gonna happen to Rick, okay?

400
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,841
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

401
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,051
-How do you know?
-Because l just know.

402
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,637
That sort of stuff, you know,
it just isn't. . .

403
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,682
-(moans) . . .done any more.
-Ugh. Stop it.

404
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,101
All right,
let's go and make these things fly.

405
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,941
-Whoa.
-(laughs)

406
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,819
(all laugh)

407
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,842
(Mike) . . .fucking obsessing !
Every single. . .

408
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,054
(Kasia) lt's because you're avoiding. . .
l'm not obsessing about a thing.

409
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,805
(Mike) Why can't we just have
a normal. . .

410
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,600
(Mike, whispering) Why can't
we just have a normal conversation?

411
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,895
When l come over here,
it's my life, my life. What am l doing?

412
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,606
Can l just live my life? l'm getting
this job because you asked me. . .

413
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,899
(Kasia) What are you doing with me?

414
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,400
You know what, l am fucking out of here.

415
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,569
l was just about to say
that you should. . .

416
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,613
(Mike) l'm actually going !
So there you go!

417
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,991
-(Kasia) Where are you going now?
-Fucking home to my manky flat.

418
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,368
(Kasia) Asshole.

419
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,078
l mean, why the hell
are you with a person

420
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,081
unless you plan
to stay with that person, you know?

421
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,833
-(Mike) Fucking out of here!
-(screams indistinctly)

422
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,919
(Kasia) Fucking coward. AsshoIe.

423
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,008
(sighs)

424
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,303
Are you and Mike splitting up?

425
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,431
Go to bed.

426
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,475
(Kasia) And the things he said to me. . .

427
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,935
-You know what he called me?
-What?

428
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:06,063
-Obsessive fucking bitch.
-Mm.

429
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,898
Fuck you !

430
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:13,654
l'm just so worn out with it, Archie,
you know?

431
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,203
Well, we could sue him, l suppose.

432
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,539
-Yeah, for what?
-l don't know.

433
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,208
Dereliction of premarital duty.

434
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:31,005
Very funny.
How about just for being a dick?

435
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,299
-Yeah, we could get him for that.
-A lazy dick.

436
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,844
He values his freedom too much,
his comforts.

437
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:41,181
Well, most men do.
That's why we need that push.

438
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,100
l've been pushing long enough.

439
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,270
Four years.
l'm 35 years old, you know?

440
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,606
-Really?
-Fuck off. l can't wait any more

441
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,441
l just can't.

442
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,527
-(Archie) ls that my wine?
-No.

443
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,238
(doorbell rings)

444
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,412
What are you doing here?

445
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,539
Just thought l'd knock about.

446
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,249
Jed isn't here.

447
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,759
(Skunk) So angry.
And she was crying and. . .

448
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,219
-l think she really loved him.
-Yeah?

449
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:23,390
(Skunk) l think she wanted them
to get married. Or buy a house.

450
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,934
-Or have a baby maybe.
-Right.

451
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,020
-l would have married him.
-Yeah?

452
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,563
Mm.

453
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,106
(crane whirring)

454
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,237
Oh, wow.

455
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,411
Come on !

456
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,416
Oh, wow.

457
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,885
Dillon !

458
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,726
This is really cool. lt's like. . .

459
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,978
Come in.

460
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,942
-You're a really cool girl.
-Thanks.

461
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,276
For a lesbian.

462
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,571
(chuckles)

463
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,828
Do you want a Nik Nak?

464
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,498
No, thanks.

465
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,627
Must be a pain
not being able to eat what you want.

466
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,591
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

467
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,470
Okay.

468
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,556
Can l have a kiss?

469
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,684
M. . . Maybe later.

470
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:53,689
All right, but later
my mouth's gonna be all Nik-y Nak-y.

471
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:58,444
All right. But not a splasher.

472
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,904
-A what?
-No swirly tongues.

473
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,324
(chuckles) Okay.

474
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,760
(Jed) Look, you've got pretty ears.
lt doesn't hurt that much.

475
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,928
-(laughs) Get off. lt hurts.
-Stop it.

476
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,972
(both laughing)

477
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,892
Get your arms out.

478
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,311
-There, one up your nose.
-No, no. (laughs)

479
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,940
Look, if you keep moving your arms,
l can't give you a lovely nose piercing.

480
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,279
-Get off.
-You look so pretty.

481
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,992
Give me your eyebrow.

482
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,121
-There we go.
-(Skunk gurgles)

483
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,290
(Kasia) All right, guys.
Come on, bed.

484
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,541
-But we're doing our books.
-(Skunk laughs)

485
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,959
Bed.

486
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,586
(Skunk whines) Dad.

487
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,422
Come on, do as you're told.
Big day tomorrow.

488
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,342
Night, Dad.

489
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,512
-Good night, love.
-Good night.

490
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,596
Very attractive.

491
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,517
-(Jed growls)
-Yeah, all right, yeah. Good, yeah.

492
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,018
(Jed chuckles)

493
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,728
Hey, where's mine?

494
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,230
(both) Night, Kasia.

495
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,856
Very funny.

496
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,566
-And don't forget teeth !
-(Skunk laughs)

497
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,120
You want a drink?

498
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,624
(Jed) And if you're wearing trainers,
they'll stomp on them. Bang !

499
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,834
And if your hair's too long,

500
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,460
what they'll do is
they'll grab it from behind.

501
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,712
-All right. Stop!
-And they'll just start. . .

502
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,049
(sighs) You need to know
about this stuff, Skunk.

503
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,552
The better prepared you are,
the better you'll do.

504
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,639
So, what they do
is they grab your hair from behind

505
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,517
and they just start snipping away
with a pair of scissors.

506
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,644
-So you pick your moment.
-Yeah.

507
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,521
And you let them know
the arrangement.

508
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,481
Yeah. . . What?

509
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,441
-The deal.
-Right.

510
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,695
And then they know where they stand.

511
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,406
-Yeah.
-Which is. . .

512
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,118
-Nowhere.
-Absolutely fucking nowhere.

513
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,703
(laughing)

514
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,710
-lt's funnier later on.
-Okay.

515
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,869
(Kasia) What about Rachel?

516
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,415
What about her?

517
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,500
(Kasia) lf she walked in right now,

518
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,170
would you take her back?

519
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,671
You must be joking.

520
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:10,135
-Not even for the kids?
-Why?

521
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,763
So they could live in fear
of her walking out again

522
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,599
whenever she felt like it?
No, thank you very much.

523
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,644
They wouldn't even know

524
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,604
who she was.

525
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,106
Poor Archie.

526
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,029
Poor Kasia.

527
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,636
l'm off to bed.

528
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,222
All right, then.

529
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,184
-Good night.
-Good night.

530
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,693
You can follow me up if you want.

531
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,616
(sighs)

532
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,088
(Skunk) Dad?

533
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,551
Dad !

534
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,725
Why aren't you in bed?

535
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,978
Jed said l was gonna get
my head flushed down the toilet.

536
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,397
-By who?
-ln school.

537
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,568
-And you believed him?
-And punched in the stomach.

538
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,737
Yeah, l believe him. He said it's. . .

539
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,904
He said it's tradition.

540
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,532
l was told the very same thing
when l was your age.

541
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,743
-That's the tradition.
-What is?

542
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,078
Putting the fear of God
into the first years.

543
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,497
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

544
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,543
Come on, then. Up you get.

545
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,505
-Night.
-Good night.

546
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:18,055
Dad, will you lie next to me
till l go to sleep?

547
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,065
Dad !

548
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,613
(overlapping chatter)

549
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,387
My God, Mike!

550
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:04,726
-lt's Mr Kiernan in school, Skunk.
-Oh.

551
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,020
-Not Mike.
-Oh, right.

552
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,024
Well, in that case
you can call me Miss Cunningham.

553
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,777
(chuckles) Fair enough.

554
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,279
Okay, everyone. My name is Mr Kiernan.

555
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,739
(school bell rings)

556
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,625
Uh, Miss Cunningham.

557
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,877
Yes, Mr Kiernan?

558
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,880
Um, how is Kasia?

559
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,215
Kasia's fine.

560
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:39,261
Will you, um, say hi to her for me?

561
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,762
Do you have a message back?

562
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,264
l do.

563
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,723
Dick.

564
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,975
Excuse me?

565
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,477
lt's what she said.

566
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:49,980
(Fiona) How many did you get?

567
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,731
-(Skunk) A hundred.
-Shit.

568
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,233
And one of the long ones.

569
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,068
"l must not use
inappropriate language. . ."

570
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,612
What the hell did you just do that for?

571
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,532
Sit down. Give me some money.

572
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,367
-What?
-Some money.

573
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,910
-Why?
-'Cause l want some.

574
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,955
And if you don't, my sister's
gonna kick the fucking shit out of you.

575
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,208
-(Fiona) How much?
-All you got. Get it all out.

576
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,626
You as well.

577
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,794
Go on, quick! Hurry up!

578
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:17,966
Now, every week, from next week on,
l want £2 from each of you.

579
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,092
What?

580
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,343
That's what it costs
to stay off the list.

581
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,971
-(Fiona) What list?
-The list of fucking death, bitch.

582
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,392
Here's your shit fucking loser's
out-of-date fucking mobile.

583
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,687
-lt's broken.
-(Fiona) What?

584
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:35,525
The cow. The absolute fucking ugly. . .

585
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,444
Go on.

586
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,864
-How many did you get?
-Two hundred.

587
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,368
Must be one of the bad ones.

588
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,538
Can l get a new phone?

589
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,125
-You've got a phone.
-lt broke.

590
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,044
-Can l get a new one?
-No.

591
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,337
Why not?

592
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,380
You should have taken better care
of the old one.

593
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,176
(Skunk) lt would make me so happy.

594
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,178
Quiet, Skunk.

595
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,389
l'd just be the happiest child.

596
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,268
l'm trying to work, love.

597
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,979
(knocking on door)

598
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,401
♫ I'd be deIirious! ♫

599
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,654
lt's just not fair.

600
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,615
-l don't care.
-You don't care about me.

601
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,492
Yeah, he doesn't care about me.

602
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,035
(mimics telephone ringing)

603
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,163
Go away, Skunk!

604
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,374
He hates me. That's what he said.

605
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,793
-Please.
-Stop it.

606
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,628
Please, Dad.

607
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,880
-He wishes l was dead.
-What?

608
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,424
-Nothing.
-(beeps)

609
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,094
Please!

610
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,012
Emily!

611
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,141
l don't want to hear it again.

612
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,185
Do you understand me?

613
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,437
Do you understand me? !

614
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,109
(Jed, mockingIy) Emily.

615
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,088
(Dillon) What time is it?
(Skunk) Ten past ten.

616
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,382
(Skunk) Do you think
he's learnt his lesson yet?

617
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,301
-(girl yelps)
-Who's this?

618
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,094
(Susan laughs)

619
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,270
(Skunk) Susan Oswald.

620
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,315
Slut.

621
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,191
No, she's not.

622
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,529
-Told you.
-(unzipping)

623
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,574
(sighs)

624
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,660
They call that fell-at-io.

625
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,205
(Susan moaning)

626
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,042
l have to go home.

627
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,841
(Kasia) Where have you been?
Why didn't you call?

628
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,218
l don't have a phone.

629
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:12,432
You little brat!
How dare you do what you just did !

630
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,976
Sit down !

631
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,773
(dialling)

632
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,654
Yes, she's here. She's fine.

633
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,825
(Skunk) Sorry, Dad.

634
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,301
(breathes heavily)

635
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,018
(Skunk) Dad.

636
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,978
My levels are off.

637
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,484
(Archie) You can never forget
how important this is.

638
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,652
l know.

639
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,365
l know it's routine, l know it's hard. . .

640
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,493
-Say it's okay, Dad.
-What?

641
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,995
l said l was sorry.

642
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,998
Now you have to say it's okay.

643
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,260
lt's okay.

644
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,394
What would you do if l died, Dad?

645
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,606
l can't even answer that question.

646
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,191
Would you cry?

647
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,401
Uh-huh.

648
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,861
A lot?

649
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,904
l don't think l'd ever stop.

650
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,448
What if l. . .

651
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,451
(groans and gasps)

652
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,458
(laughs) Stop!

653
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,126
-No.
-Get off!

654
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,544
Get off!

655
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,712
(laughs)

656
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,383
-Tell about the night l was born.
-No.

657
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,969
-Go on.
-l don't know. Why?

658
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,889
-The night, or the. . .
-The dream.

659
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,224
-Please. Come on.
-No. Not again.

660
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,893
-Tell me.
-Why do you. . .

661
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,812
-l don't even know why you like this.
-l just do. Come on.

662
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:27,233
-All right, well, it's about this woman.
-Mm-hm.

663
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,320
-And different times in her life.
-Different moments. Yes.

664
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,946
-Different moments.
-Like what?

665
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,990
-l can't remember.
-Think.

666
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,950
-l can't remember.
-Try .

667
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,998
-Um. . . Well, some of them are sad.
-Hmm.

668
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,959
-But most of them are happy.
-Hmm.

669
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,587
(Skunk) And the woman was me.

670
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,088
(Archie) And the woman was you.

671
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,508
And the dream was my future.

672
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,926
l don't know about that.

673
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:56,095
l mean, that's what it felt like,
yeah, but, yeah. . .

674
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,807
But what did l look like?

675
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,769
Hideous.

676
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,146
You're nice.

677
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,523
Stunning.

678
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,942
And then you woke.

679
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:12,529
And then l woke, and l was happy
and l was sad all at the same time.

680
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,113
And Mum was there.

681
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,824
She was the one that woke me up.

682
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,452
And she said. . .

683
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,288
(both) "Archie, she's here."

684
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,542
-Meaning me.
-Meaning you.

685
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,168
Well, you were the one
about to be born, weren't you?

686
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,461
(sniffs)

687
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,882
Oh, Skunk.

688
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,385
-l can't help it.
-l know.

689
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,061
(Archie) You're such a strange girl.

690
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,813
(Skunk sniffs)

691
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,244
Wah !

692
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,162
Come on, let's get this done.

693
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,045
Here, you do it.

694
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,597
(Skunk humming)

695
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:30,023
♫ Looking up at monsters
in the clouds

696
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,736
♫ Red's the colour when you're dead

697
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:38,615
♫ Find me gone, l'm just in bed

698
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,410
♫ Reading up on fairy tales... ♫

699
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,581
(door opens)

700
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,375
Skunk, we can go in now, love.

701
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,715
-Hi, Skunk.
-Hi.

702
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,218
(Mr Buckley) Why don't you
sit down there, Skunk?

703
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,720
(Skunk) Okay.

704
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,266
-How are you?
-(Skunk) l'm fine.

705
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:08,728
-Why are you talking like that?
-(Mr Buckley) lt's his medication.

706
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,607
-Talking like what?
-Kind of groggy.

707
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:15,652
Am l?

708
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,154
(all chuckle)

709
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,449
Wow. You've got your own telly and all.

710
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:24,118
Oh, yeah. You know, l. . .
l watch, um. . .

711
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,089
-l'm sorry.
-No, no.

712
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,842
-How's school?
-(Skunk) lt's fine.

713
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,177
We're actually on a half day today.

714
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,179
-lsn't she good to come, Rick?
-Yes, she is.

715
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,515
-She asked to, you know.
-She's really good.

716
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:49,185
l always thought
Skunk was really good, didn't l?

717
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,645
-(Mrs Buckley) Uh-huh.
-l don't know.

718
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:51,771
(all laughing)

719
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,317
What was it like?

720
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,985
Hmm?

721
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,195
You know,
when you went kind of mad?

722
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,490
-That's. . .
-ls it all right if l say that?

723
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,664
Actually, it's really hard to describe.

724
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:15,712
But it's kind of like
there was a toxic cloud.

725
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,381
-A toxic cloud?
-Yeah, or a. . .

726
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,176
a mist of evil or something.

727
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,553
Really?

728
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,722
-Or badness.
-Wow.

729
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,640
-Yeah.
-(both laugh)

730
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,350
ls it there right now?

731
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,228
(Mrs Buckley) Uh. . . Less.

732
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,397
ln fact, Dr Sinclair was saying
at this rate of improvement,

733
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,982
Rick might be able to come home
for the weekend.

734
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,316
-lsn't that right, son?
-When?

735
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,318
-Not, not now.
-No, no, no.

736
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,528
-No, not now.
-(Mr Buckley) No, not now.

737
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,029
But soon.

738
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,827
(laughs)

739
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,998
(Dillon) l had an uncle
who was a nutter like that.

740
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,208
-Thought he had worms in his hair.
-Oh, yeah?

741
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,335
Yeah, like nesting there.

742
00:45:57,045 --> 00:46:00,047
Shaved it all off.
Been bald ever since.

743
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,342
-ls he better, though?
-No, he's worse.

744
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,679
He lives in Florida now.
D'you know, they have lizards there.

745
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,849
-What?
-Lizards, millions of 'em,

746
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,018
just walking round the streets.

747
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,686
(in American accent)
"Hey, how you doin'?"

748
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,062
(laughs)

749
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,398
You and l should go sometime,
d'you know that?

750
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,608
When?

751
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,360
l don't know. One day.

752
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,238
Why? Would you come
if l asked you to?

753
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,448
Yeah.

754
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,200
What about that guy
you're in love with?

755
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,202
-Mike.
-That teacher.

756
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,205
He'd understand.
l'm in love with you as well.

757
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,374
Sweet. They call that
a "ménage à trois."

758
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:36,918
What does that mean?

759
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,377
Love triangle.

760
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,213
-Give us a kiss.
-No.

761
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,223
Nice one.

762
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,983
(Fiona) l don't know. lt was like. . .

763
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,487
l think he just switched off
or something. Click.

764
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,741
Click and he just wasn't there
any more.

765
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,910
(Sunrise) Hello, fatty.

766
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,662
l haven't got it.

767
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,622
You haven't got it?

768
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:18,167
-Are you fucking joking?
-Let me go.

769
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,669
Let go!

770
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,797
(stifles laughter)

771
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:27,260
-Fucking laughing?
-No. l'm sorry, Sunrise.

772
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,469
Bitch, you're gone!

773
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,762
History, yeah?

774
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:34,267
You're now officially on the list.
Just you fucking wait!

775
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,935
Dumpy little turd.

776
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,356
(Vikram) Does he die?

777
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,691
(Mike)
l can't tell you if he dies or not

778
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,318
because that's why we read,
to find out, okay?

779
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,487
But let's just all agree
there is a chance

780
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,364
that he may die, all right?

781
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,116
-(Vikram) l don't want him to.
-All right.

782
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:53,035
(clears throat) Now, why do we think
he goes on? Kevin?

783
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,287
Well, his life was rubbish, weren't it?

784
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,621
And boring.

785
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,790
Whereas through the doors
there could be wicked shit.

786
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,293
-Like dragons.
-Like dragons and shit.

787
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,003
-Trolls.
-Yeah, like teachers.

788
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,671
(overlapping chatter)

789
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,715
(Mike) Everyone, just wait, wait.

790
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,341
That, what Kevin said,

791
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:10,970
is the definition of courage. Right?

792
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,638
Being afraid. . .

793
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,310
but doing it anyway.

794
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,312
(Vikram) l still would not go.
(Boy) 'Course you wouldn't go.

795
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,855
(Vikram) l wouldn't want to die.

796
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,692
-He doesn't die, Vikram.
-You told me the end !

797
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,193
Why did you have to ruin it?

798
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,821
(aII yeIIing) Why? Why?

799
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,574
(yelling continues, echoes)

800
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,524
You all right?

801
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,367
(Skunk grunts)

802
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,869
-Please. . .
-Frigid slut.

803
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,204
-Please.
-Hold her.

804
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,705
l'm trying.

805
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:24,043
-Well, kick her while she's down, then.
-l am !

806
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,128
-Properly, in the ribs.
-l am ! Watch ! l am !

807
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,381
-Do it harder than that.
-God, shut up!

808
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:29,590
Do it in the ribs, not the arm.

809
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,051
-Shut up! l'll kick you next time!
-Harder!

810
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,387
-What you doing?
-What the hell is going on here?

811
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,471
Come on.

812
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,139
Skunk, you all right?

813
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,558
Listen, if you fucking touch me
like that again, l'll report you.

814
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,643
-Oh, you'll report me, will you?
-Yeah.

815
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,228
How old are you? Come on !

816
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,896
-She's half your size.
-Oh, fuck off, you paedo.

817
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,398
(Mike) Go on, get out of here.
Get out of my sight.

818
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,650
-Hey, Sunrise, get back here.
-What are you doing? That's my sister.

819
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,151
-Stay right there.
-Don't talk to my sister like that.

820
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,277
(Mike) Come here.

821
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,071
-Fucking queer.
-Down there. Stand down there.

822
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,823
-You, be quiet.
-Why are you listening to him for?

823
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,992
-He's a teacher, Sas.
-Yeah, just get out of here!

824
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,996
(Mike) For the next two weeks,
you're gonna come here for. . .

825
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,415
(Sunrise) Yeah, right.
(Mike) Sunrise, look at me.

826
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:08,587
For an hour and a half's detention
after school, starting tomorrow.

827
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:17,847
Do you understand?

828
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,435
Good. Go home.

829
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,442
(Mike) She had a bit of a run-in
with another girl,

830
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,527
but we sorted it out
and everything's fine,

831
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,529
so don't worry, it's. . .

832
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,781
Mike rescued me.

833
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,491
-(Kasia) Really?
-Hmm.

834
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,454
-Can l have a jam sandwich?
-Okay.

835
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,541
Go change out of your uniform first.

836
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,834
(groans)

837
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,966
(clears throat)

838
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,011
Here, l'll. . . l'll get that.

839
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,308
(muttering) Butter. . .

840
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,531
You know, it's kind of weird, isn't it,

841
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,575
when you're in the middle of something,

842
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:23,704
how things can be
so, uh, confusing, you know?

843
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,414
-Unclear.
-What are you talking about?

844
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,417
No. Whereas, you know,
what l'm saying is,

845
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:34,006
whereas with a bit of time
and a bit of distance and perspective,

846
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,674
things kind of. . .

847
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,598
Look, whatever you want. . .

848
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,350
Sorry?

849
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,895
A house, a baby,

850
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,940
whatever you want, l'll give you.

851
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,195
-That's very kind of you, Mike.
-That's what l'm saying.

852
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,364
lt took me, l don't know,
stepping away. . .

853
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,532
(Kasia) To get a perspective.

854
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:03,202
Yes, and to realise
that the things that you want, Kasia,

855
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,247
the things that you want are,
are the things that l want.

856
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,916
Mike, l'm with Archie now.

857
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,045
l'm sorry.

858
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,132
(Mike) You're with fucking Ar. . . Archie?

859
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,800
(Kasia) Yes.

860
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,218
(Mike) As lovers?

861
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:25,224
Well, what? Are you in love?

862
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,477
Yes.

863
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,566
Well, l'm s. . . l'm so fucking. . .
l'm happy for you.

864
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,609
l'm so fucking happy for you !

865
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,571
(Skunk) Mike. Mike?

866
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:42,158
♫ When l'm really old, one day

867
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,661
♫ One day, when l'm really old

868
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:49,248
♫ And when my hair falls out

869
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:53,919
♫ l'll stick it back with a spoon

870
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:57,798
♫ Of the marmalade that you made

871
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,091
Mike!

872
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,983
(panting)

873
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,111
(sighs)

874
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,785
What the fuck?

875
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:31,290
♫ When l'm really old, one day

876
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,792
♫ One day, when l'm really old

877
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,962
♫ We won't care who's winning

878
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:40,966
♫ Our wrinkIes wiII stretch to the moon

879
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:45,554
♫ When l'm really old, one day... ♫

880
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,474
(moaning)

881
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,985
-What the fuck?
-(Jed) Skunk.

882
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,532
(Skunk) What were you doing?
(Jed) You know what.

883
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,034
(Skunk) Why?

884
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,995
-l don't know.
-Why her?

885
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,830
l don't know!

886
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,667
Just promise you won't tell anyone.

887
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,503
All right. l just really. . .

888
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,672
-You haven't promised.
-l promise.

889
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:30,349
l just don't understand
why people would do that.

890
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,228
-lt's what you do when you're in love.
-You're in love?

891
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,231
Well, l am. l don't know about her.

892
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,234
-What if she's pregnant?
-She's not. . .

893
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,527
-Well, what if?
-Skunk!

894
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:43,237
(Sunrise) Whose could it be?

895
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:46,240
-Simon Malloy's.
-(Sunrise) Okay.

896
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,200
Jed Cunningham. Dennis Woods.

897
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,868
Jed Cunningham?

898
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,287
-Yeah.
-Ugh.

899
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:52,788
Who else?

900
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,207
(Susan) A couple of guys,
l can't remember their names.

901
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,711
-Who's that one with the dreadlocks?
-Brian Williams.

902
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:01,714
-He's gonna fucking kill me, Sunrise!
-Shut up!

903
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,759
Just let me think.

904
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,140
(door closes)

905
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:16,979
(sighs)

906
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,402
(DC Carson) And when's the last time
you saw Miss Oswald?

907
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,405
Uh. . . Last Tuesday.

908
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,574
Where?

909
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,576
Outside the school.

910
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:35,914
Uh, she was attacking another child,
so l had to. . .

911
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:40,586
Sorry, did you say Sunrise?

912
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,340
-Sorry?
-Um, Sunrise Oswald?

913
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,342
Susan.

914
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,469
-What did we say?
-Susan.

915
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,513
Oh, right, sorry,
'cause l don't know Susan.

916
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,350
lt was Sunrise who l reprimanded.

917
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,144
-(DC Carson) You don't know her?
-No.

918
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,355
Well, l mean, l know her,
she's in the school,

919
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,274
but l've never had any contact with her.

920
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,650
(swallows)

921
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,861
(DC Carson) l see.

922
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,363
Well, she claims
you've been having an affair.

923
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,451
(laughs) What?

924
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,792
Well, that's insane. She's a child.

925
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,877
(DC Jenks)
She's 1 4 years old, Mr Kiernan.

926
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,796
She's also pregnant.

927
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,308
-Mr Kiernan?
-(teacher) Can l help you?

928
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,227
-Mr Kiernan?
-Yes.

929
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,146
(child screams)

930
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,731
(grunts)

931
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,483
-lt's all right, don't worry.
-Everybody, get out!

932
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,653
(students screaming)

933
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,154
(Mike grunts)

934
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,824
Kids, out!

935
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,374
(panting)

936
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,344
(Skunk) Mike.

937
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,846
(groans)

938
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,516
-(Sunrise) They're coming, Dad !
-(gasps)

939
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,561
(Bob) All right, all right, all right.

940
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,522
Now, you know l'll be back, yeah?

941
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,566
You know l'll make sure
everything's all right, yeah?

942
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,943
-l love you so fucking much.
-Dad.

943
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,862
Oh, thanks, love.

944
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:33,949
And l love you so much, yeah?
Give us a kiss.

945
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,869
Come here, come here. Come here.

946
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,872
Oh, come on. Let's do a big
family fucking hug, yeah?

947
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,373
-(Sunrise) l love you, Dad.
-l love you so much.

948
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,792
-l love you, Dad. l love you.
-l love you, l love you, l love you.

949
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,628
l love you, l love you, l love you.

950
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,630
l love you, l love you, l love you.
l love you, l love you.

951
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,257
(Sunrise) l love you, Dad.

952
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:54,761
Can you not cause a scene, all right?

953
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,889
Saskia, no boys, all right? No parties.

954
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,224
-Oh, fuck off.
-(girls shouting)

955
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,642
Fuck off, you cunt!

956
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,311
(shouting indistinctly)

957
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,274
-Girls, get back inside.
-Get the fuck out of here!

958
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,241
l've a right to call a solicitor,
don't l?

959
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,244
-(DC Jenks) Yes.
-l'd like to do that now.

960
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,412
(knock on door)

961
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:24,917
Sorry.
Uh. . . Mr Kiernan's solicitor's here.

962
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,090
-So this is alleged?
-(DC Carson) Yes.

963
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,760
You haven't arrested my client?

964
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,804
(DC Carson) For the moment,
he's helping us with our inquiries.

965
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,265
-Get your jacket on.
-Wait a minute.

966
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,767
(Archie) No. She's a liar.
(DC Jenks) What?

967
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,602
(Archie)
She's done this type of thing before.

968
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,522
Another man,
another accusation, essentially of rape.

969
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,650
Another lie.

970
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,194
Look it up, Detective.

971
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,112
So you have a decision to make.

972
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:58,283
Either you release my client or. . .
you arrest him.

973
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:01,954
And then we'll take this matter further
as her story falls apart.

974
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,461
(Mike) Thank you.

975
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:16,009
You can thank Kasia.

976
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,054
She's the one that asked me to. . .

977
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,722
(clears throat) Right.

978
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,141
-. . .come in for you.
-Yeah. How are you two doing?

979
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,312
Well, l don't really
want to talk about that.

980
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:30,482
-Oh. Don't you?
-No.

981
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,818
(laughs) Why is that, Archie?

982
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,487
ls that because what you have
is so fucking special

983
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,863
it can't be articulated, huh?

984
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,699
No, it's because
it's none of your business.

985
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:39,908
Fuck you.

986
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,327
You know what? Fuck you.

987
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:47,165
The last thing l need
beyond losing the woman that l love

988
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,043
is to be obliged to the man
who fucking stole her.

989
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,837
-Well, l didn't steal her. . .
-Yeah, well, you fuck. . .

990
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,171
And there's no obligation.

991
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,506
Oh, fuck off, Archie!

992
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:58,010
Man, you couldn't be
more fucking patronising if you tried.

993
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,099
(Skunk) Then what?
(Archie) l don't know, love.

994
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,184
They'll probably give him
some kind of DNA test.

995
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:07,686
-Right.
-Right.

996
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,896
-You know what that is, do you?
-Yes.

997
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,691
-No.
-lt's a test

998
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,861
-that'll show he isn't the father.
-But he isn't the father!

999
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,362
-We know that, love.
-She's a liar.

1000
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,865
Everyone knows she's done it with. . .

1001
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:22,743
lots of boys.

1002
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,786
-lt doesn't matter, Skunk.
-Why not?

1003
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,038
Because they're boys.

1004
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,290
Mike is an adult. You understand?

1005
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,459
A teacher. ln this kind of situation,

1006
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,295
they have to be absolutely sure
of his innocence.

1007
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,755
(doorbell ringing)

1008
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:39,134
And until they are, they just can't
allow him to work with children.

1009
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,428
-So he's not coming back?
-(Archie) Not at the moment, no.

1010
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,640
Sorry, love.

1011
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,101
Skunk, it's your boyfriend.

1012
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:49,978
Birmingham?

1013
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:55,233
But l thought. . . l thought you and me
were gonna go to Florida

1014
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,236
-and see. . . see the lizards and stuff.
-Yeah, l know, but. . .

1015
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,905
That was when we were older.

1016
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,573
Why not now, though?

1017
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:04,743
Because my aunt says
l have to go to Birmingham, Skunk.

1018
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,912
What am l gonna do without you?

1019
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,668
-Here.
-(sighs)

1020
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:16,755
-Will you take this?
-Why should l?

1021
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,841
To remember me by.

1022
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:25,597
When do you go?

1023
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,933
Tomorrow.

1024
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:32,437
Early. So l'm not
gonna get to see you again.

1025
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,439
How long did you know that?

1026
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,485
How long did you know, Dillon? !

1027
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:40,278
-Skunk.
-You're only telling me now!

1028
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:41,947
-Why haven't you told me? !
-Skunk, stop.

1029
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,115
You're an arsehole, Dillon.

1030

Because she'll leave us, Dad,
the way she left Mike.

1075
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,473

-No, l won't.
-Yes, you will ! Don't lie.

1077

lt'll all go wrong, Dad.
Everything always goes wrong.

1078
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,523
-Why do only bad things happen?
-Good things happen.

1079
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:05,317
Like what, your sex with Kasia?

1080
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:09,571
-Skunk, listen.
-What about me or Jed or Rick or Mike?

1081
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,865
-What about Mike, Kasia?
-Skunk, you need to stop.

1082
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:15,869
l don't want to talk to either of you.
Just get out! lt's my room !

1083
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:17,913
So let's, as much as we can,

-Yes.
-Just to be safe this first time out.

1086
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,377
-Thank you, Doctor. Yes.

1093
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,640
There's blood everywhere.
Why is there blood everywhere?

1094
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,559
(Sunrise) Call an ambulance!

-Call a fucking ambulance!

1096

-What's the fucking number?
-999, you twat!

1097
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,319
(Mr BuckIey) I wonder if she means
we can't have a kick-about.

1098
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,487
(laughs) Hmm.

1099
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:33,822
Wouldn't mind
a bit of a kick-about, eh, Rick?

1100
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,575
l think l'd rather stay inside, Dad.

1101
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:41,830
Oh, well, yes, you're probably right.
Best to. . . Best to play by the book.

1102
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:48,086
Oh, Mum's made a cake that's. . .

Well, what's going on here?
Nothing changes. (sighs)

1106
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,891
Well, we won't let it bother us, huh?

1107
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:11,818
Hello, my baby. Hello.

(Mrs Buckley) Oh, just don't pay

l won't be long.

1112
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,620
-Why isn't she talking?
-Let's just get her in the ambulance.

1113
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,998
(Saskia) She's not even moving.
(paramedic) Move out the way, please.

1114
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,458
(Saskia) Just hurry up
and get her in there.

1115

(Mrs Buckley) Rick. Come on, Rick.
Just. . . Just come inside.

1117
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:33,381
There's nothing going on there
