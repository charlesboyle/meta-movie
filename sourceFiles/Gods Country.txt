1
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:30,587
Four? They're crazy. I should
just get up and walk out right now.

2
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:31,488
Okay, calm down.

3
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,722
Honestly, we put a
solid offer on the table.

4
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:35,724
My clients are selling
for four,

5
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:37,892
Leaving half a million
in equity.

6
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:39,260
Now, this is the deal.

7
00:01:39,262 --> 00:01:40,095
No. No.

8
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:42,963
Richard,
please sit down.

9
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,170
I'll show this to my clients.

10
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:58,373
Don't know if it'll fly,
but we'll see.

11
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:02,009
Hey, how's it going in
there? Anything I can do?

12
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:03,578
Listen. When
bill and Nora leave,

13
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,146
I want you to pop your head
into the conference room

14
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:08,280
And I want you to say
these exact words...

15
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:09,682
"Your clients are leaving. "

16
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:13,384
Sure. Anything else
I need to know?

17
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:15,219
No, not yet.

18
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:18,121
Hmm.

19
00:02:18,123 --> 00:02:19,088
Well?

20
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,223
3.5 million.

21
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,757
We already came down
from four.

22
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,861
We'll only break even if we
agree to three and a half.

23
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:27,761
Do you trust me?

24
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:28,461
We know you're working...

25
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:32,030
As hard as you can to close
this deal, but that Richard guy

26
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:33,098
Is taking
advantage of us.

27
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,634
I know. That's
why if you trust me,

28
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:39,536
I want you to do exactly
what I知 about to tell you.

29
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:40,971
In 10 minutes I need
for you to get up,

30
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:45,974
Walk out of this office, past the
conference room, and out the door.

31
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:49,977
I don't understand. We're
in the middle of negotiating.

32
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:50,777
Trust me.

33
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:54,180
Haven't you ever done something
without knowing the outcome?

34
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:56,982
Wait 10 minutes
and go home.

35
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:58,817
The next time
you'll hear from me

36
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,985
Will be me calling
to congratulate you.

37
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:02,219
do you understand now?

38
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:03,119
Not really.

39
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:07,890
Bill, let's just do
what she asks.

40
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:12,260
'Kay. 10 minutes.

41
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,795
Let me call you back.

42
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:16,529
Well?

43
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,864
Do we have a deal or not?

44
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,700
What is it with you
and this paper?

45
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:27,937
Can't you speak? What did they
say? Do we have a deal or not?

46
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:32,040
You're crazy!
No, they're crazy!

47
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:36,443
4.2 million?
What is going on here?

48
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:38,912
We made a fair offer and
they're going up in price?

49
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:42,047
They're tired of this back
and forth, push and pull.

50
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:45,983
And they said if you do not
agree to it in 10 minutes,

51
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:49,252
The deal's off the table.

52
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:50,653
I don't believe you.

53
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:53,589
3.7 million
is a lot of money.

54
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:57,158
I mean, who's gonna
walk away from that?

55
00:03:58,126 --> 00:04:00,027
Your clients?
They're leaving?

56
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:03,029
They're walking out
of the building right now.

57
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:04,030
Well, I guess that means
the deal's off.

58
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:08,732
What? After all the time
and work I put into this?

59
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:09,266
Go. Go get them.

60
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:11,968
As I explained, they told me
if I didn't come back,

61
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,239
- They were walking.
- Meghan, your clients are leaving.

62
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,808
Okay, four. Four,
and we go to close today.

63
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,110
- Now would you please go get them
before they leave? - Tell my clients

64
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:28,680
I'll send the paperwork
over this afternoon.

65
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:30,515
Okay.

66
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:36,185
It's been a pleasure.

67
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:38,521
Thank you.

68
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:43,123
And congratulations
on a great buy.

69
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:52,663
I just closed
the smith's deal.

70
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:55,966
Good. It's about time. No, I
don't like any of it. Redo it.

71
00:04:55,968 --> 00:05:00,669
You, come with me. There's some
people I want you to meet in my office.

72
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:05,039
Meghan, I would like to introduce
you to the Yakamoto brothers,

73
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,506
Kana and Hoshi Yakamoto.

74
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:11,944
Gentlemen, this
is Meghan Doherty.

75
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:13,511
konichiwa.

76
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,913
konichiwa.

77
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,882
she will be heading
your casino project.

78
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:23,652
Mr. Whitaker, we have
a lot riding on our deal.

79
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:27,655
I understand. Meghan is my top
investment banker here at the firm.

80
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:29,357
We've revised
our business plan

81
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:33,293
To include photos of the
extended land in the Mojave.

82
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:36,128
I have been anticipating these
plans for a few weeks now.

83
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,031
And for out next meeting, we'll
have an outline identifying

84
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:44,467
Risks, and facts
underlining your investment.

85
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:54,007
Now, that was different.

86
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,776
To say the least.

87
00:05:56,778 --> 00:06:00,178
You have your work
cut out for you now.

88
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:02,446
So, are we all
set for tonight?

89
00:06:02,448 --> 00:06:05,548
The decorations are up. The
caterers start serving at 8:00.

90
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,584
Everyone knows to be
at your house by 7:00

91
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:09,251
Or die by the hands
of Meghan Doherty.

92
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:10,419
And Valentina
knows nothing?

93
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:12,153
She thinks
we're doing sushi.

94
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:14,255
I hear you're trying to close

95
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:16,790
on the Yakamoto brothers
casino thing, Randolph.

96
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,659
You think so, al?
We'll see about that.

97
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:21,726
You've been trying to squeeze
our company for years now,

98
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:24,129
And it's not going to work.
We're not giving in.

99
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:28,065
I can't wait to show off
my new outfit tonight.

100
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:28,898
Like always.

101
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,867
Are you implying
that I知 self-Centered?

102
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:33,769
Mmm, that's right.
The same self-Centered friend

103
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:37,338
Who stuck my neck out
to get you a job at the firm.

104
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,605
How quickly we forget.

105
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,140
just remember one thing,
Randolph.

106
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:43,442
I am in first position
on Eden graham's Mojave land.

107
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,777
and I will foreclose
on saturday,

108
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:50,080
and when I do, the Yakamotos
will be knocking on my door.

109
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:54,750
That's the office.
Hold on. Hello?

110
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:57,452
Meghan,
I need you here tonight.

111
00:06:57,454 --> 00:06:59,386
Tonight?

112
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:01,155
it's
Valentina's party.

113
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:05,558
Sir... All right. I'll
be there by 6:00 pm, sir.

114
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,226
I'll have time to stop
at Jason痴 of Beverly hills

115
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,694
before I meet with Whitaker.

116
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:13,229
I want to get Valentina
something special.

117
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,999
So what's new
at the firm?

118
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,134
I closed a big one today.

119
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,069
you did? Congratulations!

120
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:22,337
How's your car dealership
going?

121
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:27,406
- Dealership is great. - That's gorgeous.
I have to get a gift for my friend.

122
00:07:29,676 --> 00:07:30,909
Ah, that's beautiful.

123
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:32,344
Any interesting opportunities
you can throw my way?

124
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:37,013
Yeah. One of my clients is thinking of
opening a chain of automatic car washes.

125
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:39,115
That sounds interesting.
I know I did real well

126
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:43,584
Investing in the last exotic
car business you got me turned on

127
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:45,186
So how much?

128
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:46,354
For you, 8,000.

129
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:48,221
That's retail.
What's my price?

130
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,357
Okay, I値l do 7,500.

131
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,859
Okay. 7,000.
But that's it.

132
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:56,494
Deal.

133
00:07:56,762 --> 00:08:00,530
- How much for that one?
- Normally it's 2,000, but

134
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:01,864
For you, 1,500.

135
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:03,065
Could you box that also?

136
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:06,000
Sure. So how's the Ferrari?

137
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:06,735
Fast.

138
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,901
You know,
that's the only car

139
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:09,136
I don't have
in my dealership,

140
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:12,004
So if you ever want to get that
thing off your hands, let me know.

141
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:14,340
Let go of my pride and joy?
Never.

142
00:08:14,342 --> 00:08:18,676
Jason, you know better
than to ask me that.

143
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:22,445
the Mojave desert.

144
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:28,149
5,000 acres of the Mojave
desert.

145
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:32,352
We are going to build
a casino resort,

146
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:36,355
Including an
18-Hole golf course

147
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:37,623
And a country club.

148
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,391
So what's the catch?

149
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:44,928
Well, Graeme ministries
owns 1,000 acres

150
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,263
Right in the middle of it.

151
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:50,599
The Yakamoto brothers
are going to need

152
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:56,136
This one piece of land
to build their vision upon.

153
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:59,838
Now, this land is already in
foreclosure,

154
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,408
But the owner,
Mr. Eden graham,

155
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,376
Is not cooperating.

156
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,478
And so, this land

157
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,148
Is going to go to auction next saturday.

158
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,548
That doesn't give
us much time.

159
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,317
I know. This guy
absolutely refuses to sell.

160
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:21,587
Therefore I need you
to drive up to the Mojave,

161
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:23,355
And meet with
Mr. Eden graham.

162
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:28,325
Meghan, you
close on this deal,

163
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:31,961
And we'll enjoy
a celebration together.

164
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:33,962
My dream will be realized

165
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:39,634
And guess who will be
in line to fill my shoes?

166
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,876
Hi!

167
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:55,945
Valentina.

168
00:09:55,947 --> 00:09:57,612
I'm sorry I missed
your party.

169
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:59,314
No, you didn't miss it.
You're here now,

170
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:00,948
And this is
how it should be,

171
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,216
Three best friends,
enjoying each other.

172
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:06,853
I knew when Whitaker called you to
his office it would be a late night.

173
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:09,254
We all knew that.

174
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,857
We decided
to wait for you.

175
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:16,693
Oh, guys,
you are so sweet.

176
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:19,895
Oh, I知 acting as if
it's my birthday. Here.

177
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:23,832
Oh my, look
at this bracelet!

178
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:26,133
It's so beautiful!

179
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:27,668
Okay, open.

180
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,168
Okay!

181
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:32,337
Oh!

182
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:33,738
Do you like it?

183
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,905
I love it!

184
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:36,740
Oh, thank you.

185
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:40,109
Look what Adam got me.

186
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:41,877
That is gorgeous!

187
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,813
you must have spent your
entire paycheck on that.

188
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:47,048
Not all of it,
but, yeah, most.

189
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:52,952
Hi, mom.

190
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:55,120
I finally caught you.

191
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:55,854
Let me talk to her.

192
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,956
Mom, I知 gonna give you
a call back tomorrow.

193
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,258
You were supposed to
call me back yesterday.

194
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,727
Good night. I love you.

195
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:09,463
She has the worst timing.
Hmm.

196
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:12,999
I have the biggest deal of
my life and she calls to chit chat?

197
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:16,902
Don't be selfish.
It's your mother.

198
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:19,904
you can't take two minutes
of your time?

199
00:11:19,906 --> 00:11:22,340
Two minutes will
turn into two hours.

200
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:25,609
I just have so much on my mind
with the Yakamoto account.

201
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:27,510
Meghan, ever since
I致e known you,

202
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:30,645
All you care about is money
and your career.

203
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:32,947
What's going to happen
when you turn 60?

204
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:36,616
You're going to wish that
someone would call and visit you.

205
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:40,585
And guess what? You are
going to be all alone.

206
00:11:40,587 --> 00:11:42,521
You are just as old as I am.

207
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:43,387
But I love my family.

208
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:48,157
And one day I plan to settle
down and have children of my own

209
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,492
So that when I get old
I値l have someone to love me.

210
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:55,363
Look at you! You don't date and you
have no friends outside of Adam and me.

211
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:56,631
It's late, and
I have to prepare

212
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,533
For the biggest presentation
of my life tomorrow.

213
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:03,435
that's right.
Big presentation.

214
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:06,838
I'll go get my computer
so I can assist.

215
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:18,646
You know that I知 right.

216
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:28,686
Let me google "god's country"
and see what we're working with.

217
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:29,620
What do we have here?

218
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:32,556
"God's country is not
just a getaway.

219
00:12:32,558 --> 00:12:35,224
It's a safe haven for
those who need a break,

220
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:37,293
In the middle of 1,000 acres,

221
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:40,261
We offer the best hiking,
camping...

222
00:12:40,263 --> 00:12:45,798
Run by minister Eden graham,
second generation...

223
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,835
good night.

224
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:26,360
Stupid shoe!

225
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:39,936
Have they made it?

226
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:40,971
Meghan, where are you?

227
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:42,172
have they made it?

228
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:42,939
They are here now.

229
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:45,874
- Okay. - And Mr. Whitaker is walking
them into the conference room.

230
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:50,077
- Why didn't you wake me?
- I've been calling you all morning.

231
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,512
I had research put something
together. It's on your desk.

232
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:58,350
Okay. Offer them coffee, tea,
something to drink. Stall them.

233
00:13:58,352 --> 00:14:00,185
You want me to go
into the conference room?

234
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:04,988
- But I...
- I don't have time for these questions!

235
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,023
Just do it!

236
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,491
Okay.

237
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:12,293
Who do you like better?
You like Matsui or Ichiro?

238
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:15,295
Uh, Meghan is a couple
of minutes away.

239
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:20,432
She asked me to offer you
something to drink.

240
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:21,165
Coffee? Water? Tea?

241
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:26,236
Tell Ms. Daugherty we prefer
her presence instead of drinks.

242
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:31,307
But since you're here,
bring all of the above.

243
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,342
Yes, sir.

244
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:39,445
Anyway, my favorite player
is Hideki Matsui.

245
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:54,556
They're waiting for you.
I stalled as long as I could.

246
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:56,824
Here's your material.

247
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:58,925
Oh, uh...

248
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:06,231
Gentlemen.

249
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,133
Thank you for coming.

250
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:11,635
Shall we get down
to business?

251
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:18,306
We've identified your prospectus
and have done and evaluation

252
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:19,974
Keeping in mind
the growth rate

253
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:21,442
Of
the surrounding Mojave area.

254
00:15:21,444 --> 00:15:26,145
We see your casino not only
as gambling for adults,

255
00:15:26,147 --> 00:15:27,913
And we believe you have
an entertainment portal.

256
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:33,384
We see the profit potential at
a capture of 40% lift annually.

257
00:15:34,486 --> 00:15:37,086
Your investment over
the course of 10 years

258
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:40,055
Will yield an
annual $2 million,

259
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:43,791
Which by year eight, from
your profit, your interest,

260
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:46,527
And neighboring leases, your
investment will be paid back in full.

261
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:50,696
We at Whitaker and associates would love
to team up with the Yakamoto brothers

262
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:56,067
To turn the Mojave desert into one
of America痴 most impressive casinos.

263
00:15:56,069 --> 00:16:01,136
Whitaker and associates is the most
qualified financial organization

264
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:05,606
To bring your astonishing
vision to reality.

265
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:08,141
Thank you.

266
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,609
excellent.

267
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:12,078
very good job.

268
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:15,547
arigato.

269
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,215
I'm sorry. Could someone
translate for me?

270
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:20,983
I just complimented Ms. Doherty

271
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:23,453
On her presentation.

272
00:16:24,954 --> 00:16:27,355
Excellent.

273
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:35,260
Did you see the look
on their faces?

274
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,795
I did.

275
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:37,763
We really won them over.

276
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:40,665
You know, Meghan, I don't hand
out compliments too easily,

277
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,866
But you were outstanding
today and I mean that.

278
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,168
But before we start
blowing our own horn here,

279
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,436
We still have some
unfinished business.

280
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:50,905
Walk with me to my car.

281
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:52,873
All right, let's not
waste any time with this.

282
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,541
I want you to get up there
as early as tomorrow.

283
00:16:54,543 --> 00:16:59,644
Have you assistant call ahead
and set up a meeting with graham.

284
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:01,580
And Meghan,

285
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:03,714
Do not pull any punches
with this guy.

286
00:17:03,716 --> 00:17:05,282
Let him know
that you mean business,

287
00:17:05,284 --> 00:17:06,816
That nothing,
and I mean nothing,

288
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,486
Will stop Whitaker and
associates from closing that deal.

289
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,854
'Cause you know what?
I can feel it.

290
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:14,655
God is on our side,
so you close this.

291
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:29,265
Hello?

292
00:17:29,268 --> 00:17:33,034
I thought maybe I壇 have a chance
to speak with my only child.

293
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:36,470
But she's always too busy
for her only mother.

294
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,105
Sorry, mother.
I've been swamped at work.

295
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:42,609
Well, it must be going well. I
received another check in the mail.

296
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:43,575
What are you doing?

297
00:17:43,577 --> 00:17:48,446
Every week the church hands out
food donations to senior citizens.

298
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:51,915
So I知 headed on over
to the retirement home,

299
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:54,350
Which is where I値l be
living in a couple of years.

300
00:17:54,352 --> 00:17:55,484
Ma, come on. You
make me feel so guilty.

301
00:17:55,486 --> 00:18:01,054
Well, you should. What has it been,
almost six months since I致e seen you?

302
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:02,422
You know what this coming
weekend is.

303
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:07,159
No, ma, I don't know what
this coming weekend is.

304
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:12,363
It's my birthday, Meghan.

305
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:18,133
Listen, Pasadena is not
that far from los Angeles,

306
00:18:18,135 --> 00:18:22,503
So I don't want to hear any excuses,
and I don't want another check from you.

307
00:18:22,505 --> 00:18:26,339
I want to be with
my daughter on my birthday.

308
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:30,476
Okay, ma, I will be with
you on your birthday.

309
00:18:30,478 --> 00:18:33,278
I promise.

310
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:38,514
Cross your heart?

311
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:39,949
Cross my heart.

312
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:45,052
Ha! Oh, I知 so excited
I知 gonna see you finally!

313
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:46,887
I love you.

314
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:49,289
Love you too, mom.

315
00:18:53,927 --> 00:18:55,726
All right.

316
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:25,048
Hello, Adam.

317
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,515
Meghan, hey.

318
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:29,184
Mr. Whitaker asked me
to get you on the phone.

319
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:33,286
- Hold that note.
- You get Meghan on the phone yet?

320
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:34,988
- What does he want to talk about?
- Yes, sir.

321
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,524
- Adam, wait... - Hello, Meghan.
You're heading up there, I hope.

322
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:42,092
- Yes, sir. I should be there in a
couple of hours. - Good. Listen to me.

323
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:45,195
The Yakamoto brothers are
scheduled to fly back into town

324
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:46,329
This thursday
to finalize everything.

325
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:50,131
I'm counting on you. I am depending
on you to take care of this.

326
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:52,133
Don't plan. Do it.
Yes, sir. I plan to.

327
00:19:52,135 --> 00:19:54,668
Call me the second you have
your meeting with graham.

328
00:19:54,670 --> 00:20:00,339
Do not leave his side without
signing those documents.

329
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:03,507
Bye.

330
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:21,454
"Close it. "

331
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:23,489
I'll close it.
I'll show him.

332
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:27,325
I'll make partner
and force him to retire.

333
00:20:40,936 --> 00:20:43,637
Where am I?

334
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:47,840
Okay...

335
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:50,475
I'll find it.

336
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:20,195
Whoo!

337
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:54,156
Paris Hilton ain't got nothin'
on you, girl!

338
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:56,258
Da-Da-Da-Da!

339
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,692
I'm sorry, ma'am...

340
00:21:57,694 --> 00:21:58,526
Don't touch the car!

341
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:03,063
Ma'am, it's not every day
that a Ferrari pulls up.

342
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:04,863
Hoo!

343
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:08,833
Hey, my name is Lenny. I'm
one of the counselors here.

344
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:12,002
- Okay...
- I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.

345
00:22:12,004 --> 00:22:12,903
I didn't give
my name to you.

346
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:16,205
Listen, I知 looking for
Mr. Graham. Is he around?

347
00:22:16,207 --> 00:22:18,206
Mr. Graham is always around.

348
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,041
Well then, can you
get him for me?

349
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:23,077
I'll be right back.

350
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,415
hey, uh, Mr. Graham,

351
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:33,184
There's a woman out here
with a Ferrari.

352
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,752
really? Where's she from?

353
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,320
My name is Doherty.

354
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,821
Where...
Where is she from?

355
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:43,458
Mrs. Doubtfire, he wants
to know where you're from.

356
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:45,258
Doherty.

357
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,627
- My name is Doherty.
- Huh?

358
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:50,262
I'm from Whitaker
and associates.

359
00:22:50,264 --> 00:22:51,830
Whitak... Oh, just...
Huh?

360
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:54,965
- I'm sorry, ma'am. I just
don't understand what you're...

361
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:57,167
Mr. Graham,
this is Meghan Doherty.

362
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:58,868
I'm with Whitaker
and associates.

363
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,137
My assistant
called yesterday.

364
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:02,404
Hello, Mr. Graham?

365
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:04,239
Mr. Graham?
Ma'am. Ma'am.

366
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:05,106
What?
Ma'am!

367
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:08,908
If you want to talk
to Mr. Graham,

368
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,077
You have to push
that button right there.

369
00:23:12,178 --> 00:23:14,279
Where is his office?

370
00:23:14,948 --> 00:23:17,315
Where is his office?

371
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,818
Incompetent people.

372
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,587
ooh, that's a nice ride!

373
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:32,892
Hoo!

374
00:23:48,305 --> 00:23:51,506
One fancy automobile.

375
00:23:55,877 --> 00:23:58,475
- Mr. Graham.
- What? No, give me a hug.

376
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:01,880
There we go.

377
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:03,780
- Ms. Doherty?
- Doherty. Meghan Doherty.

378
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:06,083
- Good to meet you. This is pastor Tinsley.
- How do you do?

379
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:10,086
- Pastor Tinsley, what do you think?
- Breathtaking.

380
00:24:10,087 --> 00:24:13,988
Pastor Tinsley痴 church is gonna
be our guest all this week at camp.

381
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,792
Mr. Graham, is there someplace
we can speak in private?

382
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:21,226
Well, sure.

383
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:22,928
Right this way.

384
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,266
Ahem.

385
00:24:36,739 --> 00:24:39,373
Have a seat.

386
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,541
I need to get right
to the point.

387
00:24:40,543 --> 00:24:45,811
As you know, we're the lender in
second position on your property.

388
00:24:45,813 --> 00:24:51,714
Mr. Whitaker sent me down here to discuss
your property in its current state.

389
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:57,352
You're in foreclosure, set to
go to auction this saturday.

390
00:24:57,354 --> 00:25:01,422
Since we don't want to risk anyone
else attempting to buy your property,

391
00:25:01,424 --> 00:25:06,125
I'm here to make you an offer
and close on this deal today.

392
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:07,660
Hmm. It's funny...

393
00:25:07,662 --> 00:25:09,327
I spoke to one of you
people the other day.

394
00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:12,162
Now Whitaker痴 sending somebody
down here to patronize me?

395
00:25:12,164 --> 00:25:16,098
Mr. Graham, I am not
patronizing you.

396
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,434
I'm here to make you
a serious cash offer,

397
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:22,970
An offer I know
is more than fair.

398
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:26,406
Look, you're behind
in monthly payments,

399
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:30,075
Behind on your taxes.
We're just trying to help.

400
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:35,413
All you have to do is sign the
power of ownership over to us

401
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:39,648
- And we can handle the rest.
- Ms. Doherty,

402
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,117
I may be a little late
paying this mortgage,

403
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,452
But I serve an on-Time god,

404
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:47,554
And he will deliver us from this
financial hold your bank has on us.

405
00:25:47,556 --> 00:25:51,190
- Mr. Graham...
- Do you know anything about this place?

406
00:25:51,192 --> 00:25:54,092
Or are you just down
here to earn a commission?

407
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,394
I'm here to do you a favor.

408
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,265
Follow me.

409
00:26:08,404 --> 00:26:10,604
I'd like to take you on
a little tour of the camp.

410
00:26:10,606 --> 00:26:14,373
A tour is not going to change
the position you're in.

411
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:18,476
Come on. What do you
have to lose?

412
00:26:40,427 --> 00:26:41,225
Hmmm.

413
00:26:41,227 --> 00:26:45,161
I知 second-Generation
land owner of graham holdings.

414
00:26:45,163 --> 00:26:45,896
my dad was a minister.

415
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,464
I use this land
to give back to god,

416
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:53,401
For me rebelling against his
righteous ways when I was a kid.

417
00:26:56,638 --> 00:26:58,204
Look at it.

418
00:26:58,206 --> 00:27:02,307
I love this land.

419
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:05,543
There's no place like it.

420
00:27:05,545 --> 00:27:10,914
Our ministry has taken a big hit,
just as I知 sure residential has.

421
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:13,515
Churches can't tithe
the way they used to

422
00:27:13,517 --> 00:27:15,216
Or pay extras for the kids,

423
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:18,319
And that trickles down
to people like us.

424
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:24,224
Meghan you can tell Whitaker
I have to decline his offer.

425
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:29,059
Listen, the deal
is the deal.

426
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:32,029
You can pray to your god
any time, day or night,

427
00:27:32,031 --> 00:27:37,399
But it's not gonna stop the fact that
out bank is gonna take this property.

428
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,100
take me back to my car.

429
00:27:51,944 --> 00:27:55,412
Meghan, I値l tell you what.

430
00:27:55,414 --> 00:27:59,481
I'd be willing to put my faith
that god will come through

431
00:27:59,483 --> 00:28:01,382
And this will all be
water under the bridge.

432
00:28:01,384 --> 00:28:06,686
If you'll just stay here
for six days.

433
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:08,721
See what it is we do here.

434
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:10,422
Watch god's blessings unfold.

435
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:15,594
And then if by some chance you don't
see why this land is so important,

436
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:20,096
I'll sign your deal before
the land goes to auction

437
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,764
So you can get your
big commission check.

438
00:28:22,766 --> 00:28:25,666
Listen, take the check,

439
00:28:25,668 --> 00:28:27,400
Gather your Christian folk,

440
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:31,704
And go build a church
in a new location.

441
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:35,707
Near a city where
people actually live.

442
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:37,908
Ms. Doherty,

443
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,010
I know as long as I don't put
my signature on that document,

444
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:44,713
I have a fighting chance to
keep what's rightfully mine.

445
00:28:44,715 --> 00:28:48,949
No, it's not over
till god says it's over.

446
00:28:48,951 --> 00:28:52,552
And god hasn't
told me anything.

447
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,953
All right.

448
00:28:53,955 --> 00:28:58,589
So, why would me staying here
for six days

449
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:01,158
Make any difference in whether
or not you sign this deal?

450
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,361
You'll be able to see what
we do here with your own eyes.

451
00:29:04,363 --> 00:29:09,197
Maybe then you'll understand why
I知 willing to put my faith in god

452
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:12,399
And fight to keep this place
open to help people in need.

453
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:17,803
To you, this is just another
business deal. This is my whole life.

454
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:22,039
If it's more money you want, let me
call Mr. Whitaker. Let's up the offer.

455
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:27,045
You have my offer. Six days and I値l
sign. That's my promise to you and to god.

456
00:29:29,246 --> 00:29:32,847
One condition. The deal
remains between you and me.

457
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:33,714
You can't tell anybody else.

458
00:29:33,716 --> 00:29:36,182
I don't want people around
here to judge or treat you

459
00:29:36,184 --> 00:29:39,818
Any differently than
the rest of the guests.

460
00:29:44,923 --> 00:29:46,523
All right.

461
00:29:46,525 --> 00:29:49,291
Deal.

462
00:29:51,662 --> 00:29:52,794
Okay.

463
00:29:52,796 --> 00:29:56,330
I just need to make a few calls.

464
00:30:16,513 --> 00:30:18,012
Meghan.

465
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:21,381
You scared the living
daylights out of me.

466
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:23,783
Sorry. We have a camp
meeting in five minutes.

467
00:30:23,785 --> 00:30:28,720
About this deal, I need to go
and make a call to my office.

468
00:30:28,722 --> 00:30:30,821
I need to go home and
get some extra clothing,

469
00:30:30,823 --> 00:30:33,290
Because the only clothing
I have is what I知 wearing.

470
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:36,626
now, do you have a phone
in your office I can use?

471
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:39,161
Five minutes. And you can
leave all your stuff in the car.

472
00:30:39,163 --> 00:30:43,497
No one's gonna mess
with it. Five minutes.

473
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:57,140
Hasn't anyone ever told them
that staring isn't polite?

474
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:03,078
Meghan, listen, why don't you
join my church's congregation?

475
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,279
You can be
our special guest.

476
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:08,948
Maybe you could teach my kids a little
something about whatever it is that you do.

477
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,550
They love your car.

478
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:12,284
Sure. Whatever you say.

479
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:13,485
Awesome. Thank you.

480
00:31:14,121 --> 00:31:18,189
I guess somebody didn't get the
memo about appropriate attire.

481
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:20,724
I'm Jacob. Everyone
around here calls me Jake.

482
00:31:20,726 --> 00:31:25,359
Well, Jacob, you can keep your
smart comments to yourself.

483
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:27,495
Look, I just saw you walk
in here with my father,

484
00:31:27,497 --> 00:31:29,129
And I can tell by the
way that you're dressed

485
00:31:29,131 --> 00:31:32,431
That you're obviously not one
of the church group leaders.

486
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:33,232
So, why are you here?

487
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:37,001
I'm here for the same reason
as everyone else. Enlightenment.

488
00:31:37,003 --> 00:31:39,136
Now I don't know
who you are, but...

489
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:42,939
I'm sorry, did you just say
that was your father?

490
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:45,441
Yeah. I run this place
with my parents.

491
00:31:45,443 --> 00:31:48,043
I'm the head counselor here.

492
00:31:48,045 --> 00:31:49,677
Sorry. Meghan Doherty.

493
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,114
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to god's country.

494
00:31:54,116 --> 00:31:58,317
I want you to shake away all the
worries of your day-To-Day rat race

495
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,586
And peer pressure, and
especially video games,

496
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:03,186
Social networking, and uh...

497
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,622
Texting.

498
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,657
You're here to relax,
make friends,

499
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:13,293
And most of all, discover that real
inner love of self and god's spirit.

500
00:32:13,295 --> 00:32:18,765
Before we begin, I want you to turn
to the person to your right and left,

501
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:22,367
And give them a big
welcoming hug.

502
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:25,803
Hey.
Oh!

503
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:30,906
Okay.

504
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:32,975
Oh my...

505
00:32:33,544 --> 00:32:38,211
Meghan, I壇 like to introduce
my better half over here

506
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:42,014
For almost 25 years now,
Caroline.

507
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:45,150
She's sort of the mother hen,
caretaker of the camp.

508
00:32:45,152 --> 00:32:50,254
So if you get sick, bitten, or
just plain homesick, she's...

509
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:50,987
Honey, stop it.
Bitten?

510
00:32:50,989 --> 00:32:53,990
He's just pulling your leg.
If it was the summer time, yes,

511
00:32:53,992 --> 00:32:57,691
But in the cooler months
we don't have that problem.

512
00:32:57,693 --> 00:32:58,993
Good to know.

513
00:32:58,995 --> 00:33:00,027
Oh, hey, Meghan,
this is Geri.

514
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:04,097
- She's one of the counselors here.
You guys should... - Hi.

515
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:05,330
Are you a model?

516
00:33:05,332 --> 00:33:06,331
You're so pretty.

517
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:09,066
I know your feet must be
killing you in those high heels.

518
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:10,401
Geri, go fetch Meghan
a pair of your boots.

519
00:33:10,403 --> 00:33:12,736
- No.
- They'll probably be a little too big,

520
00:33:12,738 --> 00:33:15,538
But they'll give your feet
a much needed rest.

521
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:21,376
Just show me to my room so I can get
on my laptop and make a few calls,

522
00:33:21,378 --> 00:33:22,643
And I値l be awesome.

523
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:27,213
Meghan, you're kind of missing the point
of what we do here in god's country.

524
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:28,814
And that is...

525
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:30,215
Off the grid.

526
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,550
Here you go.

527
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,617
Anyway, welcome aboard.

528
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:37,253
Grudge match. Ping pong.
Let's go. Want to watch?

529
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:38,288
I'm gonna watch.

530
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,055
Those are for you.

531
00:33:40,057 --> 00:33:41,423
I'll take you
to your trailer.

532
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:42,924
You're gonna want those.

533
00:33:42,926 --> 00:33:44,358
I'm not wearing them.

534
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,093
My trailer?

535
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,603
What is this?

536
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,572
this is your living quarters.

537
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,239
sorry it's not
the plaza hotel.

538
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:06,841
I am not staying in that.

539
00:34:06,843 --> 00:34:12,379
Well, it's stay in that
trailer, or in the house with all

540
00:34:15,315 --> 00:34:17,782
Here or there.

541
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:42,566
What have I gotten
myself into?

542
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:59,011
Gross!

543
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,250
Get off!

544
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:21,227
What are you doing,
stalking me?

545
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:24,096
No, I just came by
to see if you were okay.

546
00:35:24,098 --> 00:35:25,363
I am not okay!

547
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:29,499
I hear these things howling at
me and there was this big bug...

548
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:31,167
Wait. A bug?

549
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:35,137
Yes! Are you laughing at me?

550
00:35:36,572 --> 00:35:38,106
Wait a minute.

551
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:39,506
What are you doing?

552
00:35:39,508 --> 00:35:42,009
Hey, mom?

553
00:35:42,011 --> 00:35:42,742
yeah, honey.

554
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:45,411
Can you send Geri to
trailer number one, please?

555
00:35:45,413 --> 00:35:47,946
what's up, Jake?

556
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:51,582
It's Meghan.
And a bug.

557
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:52,782
It was a big bug.
Big.

558
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:57,886
Sorry. A big bug attacked her, and
now she refuses to go to the trailer.

559
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:00,054
you want me to send someone
to stay with her?

560
00:36:00,056 --> 00:36:04,691
- Affirmative.
- okay, honey. I'll tell Geri. bye bye.

561
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:07,393
Thanks.

562
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:15,065
It was a big, big bug.

563
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:18,367
It's all clear.

564
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:20,235
Hi again.

565
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:21,803
Are you always so petulant?

566
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:26,073
Oh. They actually said that you
needed a little help out here

567
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:28,074
So we're gonna be
roommates now.

568
00:36:28,076 --> 00:36:29,242
I hope that's okay.

569
00:36:29,244 --> 00:36:30,575
You're not too adjusted
to the wild, huh?

570
00:36:30,577 --> 00:36:34,845
- That's okay.
- Well, now you have your bodyguard.

571
00:36:34,847 --> 00:36:36,514
Thank you.

572
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:38,748
Okay.

573
00:36:38,883 --> 00:36:41,016
Okay, this is for you.

574
00:36:41,018 --> 00:36:42,051
What is this?

575
00:36:42,053 --> 00:36:44,953
Mr. Graham said that you
needed some clothes to wear,

576
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:46,821
So I just brought you
some of my own.

577
00:36:46,823 --> 00:36:49,790
I'm not wearing that.

578
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:55,060
We don't get any signals
out here.

579
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:57,661
What, are you guys
in the 1800's?

580
00:36:57,663 --> 00:37:00,063
- How do you live like this?
- Live like what?

581
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:02,665
Like this. No cell phone,
Wi-Fi.

582
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:04,566
What are you
supposed to be proving?

583
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:06,501
We're not trying
to prove anything.

584
00:37:06,503 --> 00:37:10,471
We're actually just
in the middle of nowhere.

585
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,140
What?
Hey, Meghan.

586
00:37:14,142 --> 00:37:18,376
Do you mind if we just say a quick
prayer before we head in for the night?

587
00:37:18,378 --> 00:37:19,911
Pray on.

588
00:37:19,913 --> 00:37:21,745
Okay.

589
00:37:25,149 --> 00:37:27,683
you've reached Meghan Doherty.
please leave a message.

590
00:37:27,685 --> 00:37:31,319
Meghan, bet you wrapped
graham and those documents

591
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:32,619
Around your
little finger today.

592
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:35,855
I can't wait to hear
about it. Call me.

593
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,729
Meghan, wake up!

594
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:46,663
Meghan. Meghan. Meghan.

595
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:49,465
Wake up, sleepyhead!

596
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:50,499
Rise and shine

597
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,968
d and kick out
the glory, glory d

598
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,336
What time is it?

599
00:37:55,338 --> 00:37:56,470
It's 6:00.

600
00:37:56,472 --> 00:37:58,404
- 6:00 a. m.?
- Yeah.

601
00:37:58,474 --> 00:38:03,576
Come back at 10:00 a. m.
I don't do breakfast.

602
00:38:12,815 --> 00:38:15,517
Geri, where's Meghan?

603
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:18,419
She wouldn't get up.

604
00:38:20,354 --> 00:38:24,823
Jake, will you ask pastor Tinsley to
start this morning's prayer service?

605
00:38:24,825 --> 00:38:26,091
Yeah, you got it.

606
00:38:26,093 --> 00:38:28,626
Thanks. Be right back.

607
00:38:28,727 --> 00:38:32,896
All right, y'all, how's
everybody doing today?

608
00:38:48,141 --> 00:38:49,007
What is wrong with you?

609
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:50,741
We're having prayer
before breakfast

610
00:38:50,743 --> 00:38:52,410
And you have to join
your assigned group.

611
00:38:52,412 --> 00:38:55,578
Listen. I'm tired. I
am not going anywhere.

612
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,348
And I have agreed to
stay here for six days.

613
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:02,050
You agreed to be part
of the journey.

614
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:04,451
Being part of the journey
means taking the journey.

615
00:39:04,453 --> 00:39:08,154
Now if you don't show up for your
assigned group, our agreement's off.

616
00:39:08,156 --> 00:39:12,424
You can get back in your fancy car
and drive back to los Angeles today.

617
00:39:12,426 --> 00:39:16,960
Okay. I get your point. Let
me just go take a shower...

618
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:22,631
No time for that. You gotta meet your
group. Breakfast is in 15 minutes.

619
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:27,535
Get up, throw some water on
your face, I値l see you out here.

620
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,412
Jake, do we know
where your father is?

621
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:48,083
There she is.

622
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:26,809
Meghan, I thought we could
all sit down together,

623
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:29,078
And eat as a family.

624
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:36,683
Let's bow our heads
in prayer.

625
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:39,919
And Jesus said unto them,
"I am the bread of life,

626
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:42,754
He that cometh to me
shall never hunger

627
00:40:42,756 --> 00:40:46,891
And he that believeth
on me shall never thirst.

628
00:40:46,893 --> 00:40:49,025
amen.
Amen.

629
00:40:49,027 --> 00:40:51,193
Now we can eat.

630
00:40:56,132 --> 00:40:59,700
All right, gang, remember
this is a contest

631
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:00,933
So there are special
reward activities

632
00:41:00,935 --> 00:41:03,202
For the group that pulls
together and does the best job.

633
00:41:03,204 --> 00:41:07,838
The first activity is a two-Mile
hike up to the tennis courts.

634
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,341
Lenny, it's all you, buddy.

635
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:11,774
Wait.
You all right?

636
00:41:11,843 --> 00:41:14,576
I am not dressed for a two-Mile
hike out in this jungle.

637
00:41:14,578 --> 00:41:16,712
I'd actually be more
worried about the snakes.

638
00:41:16,714 --> 00:41:22,149
come on, I知
just kidding with you.

639
00:41:22,151 --> 00:41:24,417
I got your back.

640
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:28,953
You're gonna be
all right.

641
00:41:28,955 --> 00:41:30,088
Thank you.

642
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,189
Okay, let's go for a hike!

643
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:44,965
you've reached Meghan Doherty.
please leave a message.

644
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:47,400
hola, Meghan, you've been
gone for two days now.

645
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:49,635
We all know when you're working on
a big deal you stop communicating,

646
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:54,673
But you missed our weekly facial
appointment today, and that's not like you.

647
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:59,642
Okay, call me. Bye.

648
00:42:02,511 --> 00:42:06,513
Group three, we're here,
and you might notice

649
00:42:06,515 --> 00:42:09,282
That there are
no tennis rackets. But,

650
00:42:09,284 --> 00:42:13,552
We do have these.

651
00:42:13,554 --> 00:42:16,887
Oh, no.

652
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:19,923
It is bad enough
that we hiked two miles,

653
00:42:19,925 --> 00:42:21,324
And now you expect us
to work?

654
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:24,026
Come on. It'll be fun.
You'll have fun.

655
00:42:24,028 --> 00:42:26,228
We're gonna
clean this place up.

656
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,361
We're gonna get it nice
and beautiful.

657
00:42:27,363 --> 00:42:32,999
What is fun about hiking two
miles to clean a tennis court?

658
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,301
It's not about the work.

659
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,602
It's about us working
together as a team.

660
00:42:37,604 --> 00:42:40,871
I can't believe
what I知 hearing.

661
00:42:40,873 --> 00:42:44,106
It's like you're brainwashed.

662
00:42:49,378 --> 00:42:50,377
Okay.

663
00:42:50,379 --> 00:42:51,111
We'll start on this end,

664
00:42:51,113 --> 00:42:53,780
And we gotta
work our way back.

665
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,882
Let's do it!

666
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:27,905
Hey, Meghan.
Everything okay?

667
00:43:27,907 --> 00:43:30,540
No. What do kids learn
from hiking two miles

668
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:32,140
Up to a tennis court
covered in weeds,

669
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:36,377
And guess what? Here are some gloves and
shovels and let's clean the tennis court

670
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:38,945
And learn about the good lord. Hmmm.

671
00:43:38,947 --> 00:43:42,615
- Calm down.
- I am not going to calm down!

672
00:43:42,617 --> 00:43:46,083
Why don't you just sign this document?
Just give up already.

673
00:43:46,086 --> 00:43:48,619
There's nothing you can do
to save this land.

674
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:51,755
I get it that you are a man of
god and you live off this and,

675
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:55,024
But I don't see a miracle
that's gonna come out of the sky

676
00:43:55,026 --> 00:43:57,292
And save this place!

677
00:43:57,294 --> 00:43:58,892
You done?

678
00:43:58,894 --> 00:44:00,127
No. Do you want
more money?

679
00:44:00,129 --> 00:44:03,496
'Cause if you want more money,
I could get you more money.

680
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:05,164
What is it that you want?

681
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,298
Ms. Doherty...

682
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,599
We have an agreement.

683
00:44:07,601 --> 00:44:10,167
I plan to stick to my end
if you stick to yours.

684
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:15,338
Now if you don't get back
to your group, deal's off.

685
00:44:23,144 --> 00:44:24,945
Oh!

686
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:40,956
Well, welcome back!

687
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:57,434
I need a facial
and a makeover so bad.

688
00:44:57,436 --> 00:45:00,304
Wow, you look so
different.

689
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:02,805
You look really pretty
without makeup.

690
00:45:03,775 --> 00:45:09,343
Oh, my body hurts so bad.

691
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:13,046
Have you ever had a facial
or...?

692
00:45:13,048 --> 00:45:15,881
no.
No.

693
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:18,349
Sit right there.

694
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,054
'Kay.

695
00:45:26,823 --> 00:45:30,491
You have pretty healthy skin.
You should take care of it.

696
00:45:30,493 --> 00:45:32,092
Oh, I wash it with soap.

697
00:45:32,094 --> 00:45:33,960
Soap?

698
00:45:33,962 --> 00:45:37,096
Soap is the harshest thing
on a lady's skin. Huh-Uh.

699
00:45:37,098 --> 00:45:42,934
My friend Valentina and I,
we get a facial once a week.

700
00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:45,535
Oh.

701
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:50,038
I feel like my
face is cracking.

702
00:45:53,775 --> 00:45:55,475
Want to see?

703
00:46:12,023 --> 00:46:14,956
Good morning!

704
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:17,991
what time is it?

705
00:46:17,993 --> 00:46:20,426
5:45.

706
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:22,828
Why do we have to get up
so early?

707
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:27,932
"Early to bed, early to rise, makes
a girl healthy, wealthy, and wise. "

708
00:46:27,934 --> 00:46:29,666
All right, I know that's
not in the bible.

709
00:46:29,668 --> 00:46:34,803
How did you sleep? Gosh,
last night was so special.

710
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:39,240
Just, it was like almost
like I had a sister.

711
00:46:42,043 --> 00:46:43,542
Ow!

712
00:46:43,544 --> 00:46:44,310
Are you okay?

713
00:46:44,312 --> 00:46:47,545
It feels like someone's
poured concrete down my back.

714
00:46:47,547 --> 00:46:50,447
- Oh no!
- Listen, why don't you just go ahead

715
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:55,552
And tell Mr. Graham that I can't
get out of bed because my back hurts.

716
00:46:56,654 --> 00:46:59,087
Just go ahead.

717
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,813
hello, Meghan?

718
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:40,950
My dad asked me
to come check on you.

719
00:47:41,918 --> 00:47:47,722
Meghan, are you all right?

720
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:52,358
I'm gonna come in.
Are you dressed?

721
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:56,027
Ow! Ow!

722
00:47:56,962 --> 00:47:59,029
Ow!

723
00:47:59,031 --> 00:47:59,997
Are you okay?

724
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,131
Oh, I知 all right.

725
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:04,867
I just strained my back
from pulling weeds yesterday.

726
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:06,835
I thought I had some
ibuprofen in the car.

727
00:48:06,837 --> 00:48:08,003
Well come on, let's
get you some aspirin.

728
00:48:08,005 --> 00:48:12,672
You wouldn't happen to know where
there would be a phone I could use.

729
00:48:12,674 --> 00:48:15,608
Yeah, well, the only phone's
in my father's office.

730
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:20,178
Other than that the closest phone's
about 10 miles away in the nearest town.

731
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,578
- I could ask him if you like.
- Oh. Oh, no.

732
00:48:22,581 --> 00:48:25,749
I guess I could drive you to
town if it's that important.

733
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:27,616
Yes, it is that important.

734
00:48:27,618 --> 00:48:28,717
Just far enough until
I get some cell signal,

735
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:31,119
- And then I could make the call.
- Yeah, sure.

736
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:35,055
Come on. We'll take my car
and we'll be back before lunch.

737
00:48:35,057 --> 00:48:37,256
Yeah, all right.

738
00:48:57,638 --> 00:48:58,405
Where are
you guys headed?

739
00:48:58,407 --> 00:49:01,774
She needed to make an important
call and use the phone.

740
00:49:01,776 --> 00:49:04,075
I didn't want to bother you.

741
00:49:04,077 --> 00:49:07,110
Is that right, Meghan?

742
00:49:07,112 --> 00:49:08,378
Yeah.

743
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,746
That's right.

744
00:49:17,986 --> 00:49:19,053
You okay?

745
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:22,889
Yeah. All of a sudden
I just feel sick.

746
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:26,358
Maybe carol can help you
with her sudden sickness.

747
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,860
You know, I think
I値l be okay.

748
00:49:28,862 --> 00:49:32,262
I just need to
sit down and rest.

749
00:49:46,607 --> 00:49:49,007
Run! Run!

750
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:07,487
We would have won if I didn't
have to run two legs of the race.

751
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:12,223
Yeah, what's her problem?
She scared of breaking a nail?

752
00:50:19,162 --> 00:50:20,229
So how do you feel?

753
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:22,797
I still feel a little dizzy.

754
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:24,833
I understand if you
want to leave, but...

755
00:50:24,835 --> 00:50:26,433
I wasn't trying to leave.

756
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:28,802
I will be here
until next saturday,

757
00:50:28,804 --> 00:50:30,770
'Cause we agreed
that you would sign that deed.

758
00:50:30,772 --> 00:50:33,138
And I値l be here to
personally hand it to you.

759
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,007
It sure looked like you
were trying to leave today.

760
00:50:35,009 --> 00:50:38,309
I wasn't trying to leave.
I was making a call.

761
00:50:38,311 --> 00:50:41,811
A job is at stake and I
needed to let Mr. Whitaker know

762
00:50:41,813 --> 00:50:43,212
It's taking a lot longer
than I thought.

763
00:50:43,214 --> 00:50:47,982
Meghan, the point is
to leave that behind.

764
00:50:47,984 --> 00:50:50,150
You being here
is about resting

765
00:50:50,152 --> 00:50:51,952
And getting in touch
with god.

766
00:50:51,954 --> 00:50:54,253
Calling Whitaker
is not gonna change that

767
00:50:54,255 --> 00:50:55,721
Or speed up the process.

768
00:50:55,723 --> 00:50:58,256
You are just so in control.

769
00:50:58,258 --> 00:50:59,624
But you know what I致e
figured out?

770
00:50:59,626 --> 00:51:04,561
You're the only one who knows
how bad things are around here.

771
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:09,999
And you're the only one who knows
that this may be the last week

772
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,000
This place is in business.

773
00:51:13,002 --> 00:51:17,436
I wonder how your family
would feel if they found out.

774
00:51:19,706 --> 00:51:22,073
You threatening me?

775
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:34,749
<i>you've reached Meghan
Doherty. please leave a message.</i>

776
00:51:35,851 --> 00:51:36,817
Meghan, hey, it's me.

777
00:51:36,819 --> 00:51:38,785
I've been calling
for three days now.

778
00:51:38,787 --> 00:51:41,186
No one at god's country
is answering the phone.

779
00:51:41,188 --> 00:51:46,524
So, if you had closed the deal you
would haves called by now, right?

780
00:51:46,526 --> 00:51:50,093
I'm really getting worried.

781
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:53,195
<i>Hola, Meghan,
soy yo.</i>

782
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:54,697
It's Valentina.

783
00:51:54,699 --> 00:51:57,398
I wish you would just
pick up the phone.

784
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,001
We are all trying
to locate you.

785
00:52:01,003 --> 00:52:03,135
I really hope that

786
00:52:03,137 --> 00:52:08,672
Your not calling has anything to do
with our discussion the other night.

787
00:52:08,674 --> 00:52:11,141
I'm so sorry.

788
00:52:11,143 --> 00:52:14,644
I miss you.

789
00:52:14,646 --> 00:52:18,280
Please, just,
just call me back or,

790
00:52:18,282 --> 00:52:20,681
Or call Adam, okay?

791
00:52:20,683 --> 00:52:22,716
All right.

792
00:52:22,718 --> 00:52:24,751
Bye.

793
00:52:33,257 --> 00:52:37,693
d gotta love it in god's
country... d

794
00:52:51,137 --> 00:52:53,005
nice!

795
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:56,673
You know what, I was
just thinking something.

796
00:52:56,675 --> 00:53:01,043
When I was a kid growing up
in California,

797
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:03,345
One of the things
that I remember the most

798
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:06,648
Was spending the holidays
together with my family.

799
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,382
And even though we were
all packed in there...

800
00:53:08,384 --> 00:53:10,716
It was a tiny little
two-Bedroom house...

801
00:53:10,718 --> 00:53:11,817
I was the runt-

802
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:12,752
Rightfully so!

803
00:53:12,754 --> 00:53:13,653
I slept on the floor.

804
00:53:13,655 --> 00:53:16,588
I had my brother here,
I had my sister here.

805
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:19,089
Cousins everywhere.

806
00:53:19,091 --> 00:53:22,025
I never felt crowded.

807
00:53:22,027 --> 00:53:23,893
Never.

808
00:53:23,895 --> 00:53:29,092
You know what I felt?
I felt love. I felt togetherness.

809
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:31,731
I just don't think there's anything
that can replace that feeling,

810
00:53:31,733 --> 00:53:36,770
That feeling of being
together with your family.

811
00:53:37,871 --> 00:53:39,403
- Amen.
- Amen.

812
00:53:39,439 --> 00:53:42,139
I think maybe we should
take a little moment here

813
00:53:42,141 --> 00:53:44,573
To realize how lucky we are

814
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:49,177
To be here with each other.

815
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:53,013
amen.

816
00:53:54,449 --> 00:53:55,915
All right.

817
00:54:02,521 --> 00:54:06,790
I'm sorry if I got you
into any trouble this morning.

818
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:11,794
No, you didn't get me
into any trouble.

819
00:54:11,796 --> 00:54:14,062
I do have a question
for you.

820
00:54:14,064 --> 00:54:18,098
What's going on? Why is my
father hovering over you like

821
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,332
Mother over a new born baby?

822
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:28,472
When I came here I told
him that I needed help.

823
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:32,574
And so he agreed to help me
and treat me like everyone else.

824
00:54:32,576 --> 00:54:36,911
I'm not being nosy,
but help you with what?

825
00:54:37,212 --> 00:54:41,081
Don't worry. I'm not
a drug addict or anything.

826
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:43,415
I'm a workaholic.

827
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:47,485
And so it's work that
I think about all the time

828
00:54:47,487 --> 00:54:50,487
And hence I知
up here for rest.

829
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:53,823
Hence, no cell phones,
no computers,

830
00:54:53,825 --> 00:54:54,990
None of that stuff.

831
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:56,925
That's what your dad's
been helping me with.

832
00:54:56,927 --> 00:55:01,762
Yeah, well, he can be bullheaded
and stubborn sometimes.

833
00:55:01,863 --> 00:55:04,630
Tell me about it.

834
00:55:06,899 --> 00:55:09,067
How's your back?

835
00:55:11,136 --> 00:55:13,137
You know, it's...

836
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:15,138
It's still a little tight

837
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,908
But I think the aspirin
has helped ease the pain.

838
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,579
so what do you...

839
00:55:27,482 --> 00:55:28,447
So tell me about Jake.

840
00:55:28,449 --> 00:55:32,517
I've been a counselor here since
my parents own and run the place.

841
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:36,019
I left for a couple of years to
go to college and business school

842
00:55:36,021 --> 00:55:39,422
And then I came back to help
my mother and father run it.

843
00:55:39,424 --> 00:55:42,257
Where did you go
to business school?

844
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:44,859
Harvard.

845
00:55:45,227 --> 00:55:48,962
You went to Harvard
business school?

846
00:55:48,964 --> 00:55:50,230
Yeah.

847
00:55:50,232 --> 00:55:51,663
What are you doing here

848
00:55:51,665 --> 00:55:52,464
Working as a counselor?

849
00:55:52,466 --> 00:55:58,035
Who needs wall street? I came here to
learn how to build the perfect bonfire.

850
00:55:58,037 --> 00:56:02,738
Plus I make
one heck of a smore.

851
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:11,478
Listen, do you
want to come with me?

852
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,280
There's something
I want to show you.

853
00:56:15,715 --> 00:56:17,849
Okay.

854
00:56:18,384 --> 00:56:21,719
So, this is my vision.

855
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:24,053
I want to build a Christian
college with full student housing.

856
00:56:24,055 --> 00:56:29,423
The campus will be a state of the art
college with full academic curriculum.

857
00:56:29,425 --> 00:56:30,725
And the students, they
can earn college credit

858
00:56:30,727 --> 00:56:33,326
And they can earn scholarships by
working at the camp during the summer.

859
00:56:33,328 --> 00:56:38,433
This is a day care center for single
mothers that want to attend the college.

860
00:56:40,634 --> 00:56:43,567
This is student housing,
and look at this.

861
00:56:43,569 --> 00:56:47,203
That's the student activity
center.

862
00:56:47,205 --> 00:56:50,672
I'm impressed. Does your
father know about this?

863
00:56:50,674 --> 00:56:52,240
Yeah, of course he does.
We spent thousands

864
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,676
Putting together a business plan
with some really solid projections.

865
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:57,944
And we can get state funding,
tax relief.

866
00:56:57,946 --> 00:57:01,113
I'm talking about building
an entire infrastructure here,

867
00:57:01,115 --> 00:57:06,051
I mean electricity, sewage, water, paving
a road that goes all the way to the highway.

868
00:57:07,152 --> 00:57:10,052
I'm sorry. Am I boring you with this?
- No! No.

869
00:57:10,054 --> 00:57:13,122
So why haven't you
put this plan into action?

870
00:57:13,124 --> 00:57:16,157
Graham estates is
a nonprofit organization.

871
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:18,392
It raises most of our money
through church offerings.

872
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:21,828
With the economy hitting
all churches, big and small,

873
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:24,362
It's put our entire
organization into flux.

874
00:57:24,364 --> 00:57:26,898
What we need is a venture
capitalist to invest,

875
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,900
But so far efforts
have fallen on deaf ears.

876
00:57:29,902 --> 00:57:35,003
Our vision is not their
vision. My family...

877
00:57:35,005 --> 00:57:39,273
We really believe in helping
those who need help.

878
00:57:39,275 --> 00:57:41,908
It's god's way.

879
00:57:46,279 --> 00:57:48,179
paperwork looks good.

880
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:50,415
we are ready to move forward
with Whitaker and associates.

881
00:57:50,417 --> 00:57:54,318
Mr. Whitaker, one question...
where's Ms. Doherty?

882
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,218
Have you heard anything?

883
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:56,085
Nothing. Adam, I知 worried.

884
00:57:56,087 --> 00:57:59,621
My brother thinks she's very impressive.

885
00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:01,223
It's been four days!

886
00:58:01,225 --> 00:58:02,289
Okay, hold on.

887
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:04,158
Yes.
Ms. Doherty?

888
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,125
Valentina hasn't
heard anything.

889
00:58:06,127 --> 00:58:08,427
...and she is. She is
very impressive indeed,

890
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:12,730
- And right now she's away.
She's handling... - Uh...

891
00:58:12,732 --> 00:58:14,398
...some very detailed
business...

892
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,132
I don't know what to do
or how to reach her.

893
00:58:16,134 --> 00:58:19,835
Why doesn't someone just drive down
there and make sure she's all right?

894
00:58:19,837 --> 00:58:24,372
- Uh... - ... I can assure you that
everything is going to plan,

895
00:58:24,374 --> 00:58:28,809
And the closing will
take place on time.

896
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:30,209
How's the weather
over there, Hoshi?

897
00:58:30,211 --> 00:58:34,379
Mr. Whitaker doesn't want
to go down and interfere.

898
00:58:34,381 --> 00:58:36,380
He'd prefer for Meghan
to call in.

899
00:58:36,382 --> 00:58:38,616
She's working on some
really big deal for the firm.

900
00:58:38,618 --> 00:58:42,718
I don't know much about it, though,
other than it's worth a lot of money.

901
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,287
Forget Whitaker and how much
money this deal is worth.

902
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:48,089
What if she's in trouble?
What if she needs our help?

903
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,023
- Uh...
- anything could have happened to her.

904
00:58:50,025 --> 00:58:53,626
You get on that phone
and call the state police

905
00:58:53,628 --> 00:58:56,227
And place a missing persons
report.

906
00:58:56,229 --> 00:58:59,364
Don't just sit around and
do nothing. You hear me?

907
00:58:59,366 --> 00:59:03,432
Okay, well, look, Mr. Whitaker says if she
doesn't call in the next couple of days,

908
00:59:03,434 --> 00:59:08,937
He'll go down there himself. All
right? I gotta go, though. Okay, bye.

909
00:59:08,939 --> 00:59:11,872
You can't keep putting this
off. What are you going to do?

910
00:59:11,874 --> 00:59:16,976
I don't know. We've tried her
cell many times. There's no answer.

911
00:59:18,078 --> 00:59:19,578
Adam, our friend is missing.

912
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,446
If you're not going
to call 911, I will.

913
00:59:22,448 --> 00:59:23,947
You decide.

914
00:59:23,949 --> 00:59:26,249
If I call 911 and she's okay,

915
00:59:26,251 --> 00:59:29,985
I risk blowing her deal
and my job.

916
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:46,296
- How's your back?
- My back's doing good.

917
00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:49,098
Hey, Meghan, I could
use your help on this pull.

918
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,233
No!

919
00:59:50,235 --> 00:59:51,133
Come on!

920
00:59:51,135 --> 00:59:52,834
You can do it.

921
00:59:54,438 --> 00:59:55,603
Meghan!

922
00:59:55,605 --> 00:59:57,772
Meghan! Meghan!

923
00:59:57,774 --> 01:00:00,473
Oh, wait a second.
Let me put my hair up.

924
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:01,807
Bring it on, blondie!

925
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:03,075
You're goin' down!

926
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:05,443
You're goin' down.
You got nothing.

927
01:00:05,445 --> 01:00:07,912
grab your ropes,
everybody!

928
01:00:07,914 --> 01:00:10,647
on your marks,

929
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:12,982
Get set,

930
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,216
Pull!

931
01:00:15,485 --> 01:00:17,786
bring it on!

932
01:00:18,087 --> 01:00:21,622
Okay, come on, come on!
One, two three!

933
01:00:21,624 --> 01:00:23,022
Come on, guys!
Pull!

934
01:00:23,024 --> 01:00:24,590
One, two three! Pull!

935
01:00:24,592 --> 01:00:25,557
Pull harder!

936
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:27,526
Come on guys!
Here we go!

937
01:00:27,528 --> 01:00:30,628
One, two three! Pull!

938
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,201
You did
a great job!

939
01:00:43,871 --> 01:00:47,807
Meghan, he has never lost!
That is amazing!

940
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:52,910
Victory, baby!
Victory!

941
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,881
Great job.

942
01:00:59,983 --> 01:01:01,850
So this is it.

943
01:01:01,852 --> 01:01:03,985
This is what it's all about.

944
01:01:03,987 --> 01:01:06,253
Wow.

945
01:01:06,255 --> 01:01:09,456
this is your reward
for winning at tug-Of-War.

946
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:11,557
you didn't
let me win, did you?

947
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:16,595
trust me when I tell you this. I love
to win too much to allow you to win.

948
01:01:31,805 --> 01:01:35,040
Okay, I... I have to go.
stay on task...

949
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:37,808
- wait.
- ... it's not personal. It's business...

950
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,443
did I do something wrong?

951
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:42,912
Can you take me back
to camp?

952
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:49,383
Meghan, so, I spoke to a guy,
out at god's country,

953
01:01:49,386 --> 01:01:53,120
And he said that a Meghan
Doubtfire with a Ferrari

954
01:01:53,122 --> 01:01:56,188
Has been out there
for the past five days.

955
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:59,124
So what's goin' on?

956
01:01:59,126 --> 01:02:01,126
What have they done to you?

957
01:02:01,128 --> 01:02:03,427
Look, I don't care
about the Yakamoto deal.

958
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:07,563
But if I don't hear from you
by the end of the auction,

959
01:02:07,565 --> 01:02:08,463
I'm calling the police.

960
01:02:08,465 --> 01:02:10,165
So what do you do
for a living?

961
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:15,902
- I'm in real estate.
- Oh, real estate. That sounds interesting.

962
01:02:15,904 --> 01:02:16,736
I want to major
in civil law.

963
01:02:16,738 --> 01:02:20,506
My father's a lawyer, so I get to see
how he helps people out of tight spots.

964
01:02:20,508 --> 01:02:24,909
I can never see you as a
person who would major in law.

965
01:02:24,911 --> 01:02:30,380
Why, 'cause I知 not
all glamorous like you?

966
01:02:31,482 --> 01:02:33,748
I always wanted to fit in
with the girls, you know.

967
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,283
It's just, I have
four brothers.

968
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:38,719
It's just easier
to play rough, you now?

969
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:43,588
I have an idea. Listen, why
don't you come to los Angeles

970
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:45,923
For a weekend with me?
Really?

971
01:02:45,925 --> 01:02:50,794
Yeah, we can,
we can go shopping,

972
01:02:50,796 --> 01:02:52,162
And...

973
01:02:52,164 --> 01:02:58,067
We could find you a new
hair style.

974
01:03:02,003 --> 01:03:05,004
How does that sound?
We could have some girl time?

975
01:03:05,006 --> 01:03:07,205
You know, just do
a bunch of girl things.

976
01:03:07,207 --> 01:03:09,040
I would like that.

977
01:03:09,042 --> 01:03:09,773
Yeah?

978
01:03:09,775 --> 01:03:10,974
Sounds like
something my mother

979
01:03:10,976 --> 01:03:12,576
And I would
have done together.

980
01:03:12,578 --> 01:03:13,943
Oh. Where's your mother?

981
01:03:13,945 --> 01:03:16,711
She died last year.

982
01:03:17,747 --> 01:03:19,781
I'm sorry.

983
01:03:19,783 --> 01:03:24,484
My father died when
I was about your age.

984
01:03:24,486 --> 01:03:27,119
I did everything
with him, and then

985
01:03:27,121 --> 01:03:29,521
When he died I just lost
interest in everything.

986
01:03:29,523 --> 01:03:35,492
Hey, you know what? You seem
too nice to be a lawyer.

987
01:03:35,494 --> 01:03:37,760
All the lawyers I know
are just ruthless.

988
01:03:37,762 --> 01:03:40,496
There's good and bad in
everything and everyone.

989
01:03:40,498 --> 01:03:42,230
I want to be a lawyer
so I can...

990
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:47,000
So I can fight for the people that
can't afford to fight for themselves.

991
01:03:47,002 --> 01:03:48,067
You know, for example,

992
01:03:48,069 --> 01:03:50,936
Say there's this big bank that locks
an elderly couple into a bad mortgage,

993
01:03:50,938 --> 01:03:56,474
And then tries to evict them from their
home for the money 'cause they're greedy.

994
01:03:56,476 --> 01:03:58,675
That's when I would swoop in...
Superlawyer extraordinaire,

995
01:03:58,677 --> 01:04:03,512
Coming in, saving the day,
saving the elderly couple,

996
01:04:03,514 --> 01:04:05,813
Punishes the bank,
does the right thing,

997
01:04:05,815 --> 01:04:08,748
I don't know, I think
it'd be great.

998
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:30,264
I know this verse on
greed. Isaiah 56:11.

999
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:36,101
"Yeah, they are greedy dogs
who can never have enough.

1000
01:04:36,103 --> 01:04:39,971
They are shepherds
that can not understand. "

1001
01:05:39,014 --> 01:05:43,082
Where are you, Meghan?

1002
01:05:43,417 --> 01:05:47,552
This is what
I was talking about, Jake.

1003
01:05:48,353 --> 01:05:50,820
Luke 10:23.

1004
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,522
"blessed are the eyes
that see what you see. "

1005
01:05:52,524 --> 01:05:56,358
- How are you doing this morning?
- Great. Good to see you.

1006
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,459
yeah?
hey, Jake.

1007
01:05:58,461 --> 01:05:59,394
The truck. Where is it?

1008
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:00,428
right in front of the office.

1009
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:02,262
yup.
keys inside?

1010
01:06:02,264 --> 01:06:04,231
Thanks, man.

1011
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:08,667
come in, Meghan.

1012
01:06:08,768 --> 01:06:12,536
- Eden?
- Hi, Meghan. Have a seat.

1013
01:06:12,538 --> 01:06:15,004
I have a confession to make.

1014
01:06:15,006 --> 01:06:19,808
Mr. Whitaker didn't send me
down here just to make an offer.

1015
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:22,510
There's a pair of businessmen,
the Yakamoto brothers,

1016
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:24,245
And they're here
to develop the land.

1017
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:27,147
They want to turn it
into a casino and resort.

1018
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,982
It's a $100 million deal
and I don't see any way

1019
01:06:29,984 --> 01:06:31,183
That you could stop it
from happening,

1020
01:06:31,185 --> 01:06:36,019
Especially since tomorrow
is the auction.

1021
01:06:36,021 --> 01:06:39,288
Thanks for
the information, Meghan.

1022
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:42,591
There's nothing left
for me to do but pray.

1023
01:06:42,593 --> 01:06:44,759
Will you stop it?

1024
01:06:44,761 --> 01:06:46,794
Right now is the decision!

1025
01:06:46,796 --> 01:06:48,128
Mr.
Whitaker is gonna come down

1026
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,529
The road any
second now and just

1027
01:06:49,531 --> 01:06:52,031
Shut down
the entire operation,

1028
01:06:52,033 --> 01:06:54,666
Including me.

1029
01:06:55,768 --> 01:06:57,201
I get it. I understand.

1030
01:06:57,203 --> 01:07:01,271
There is something really
special about this land.

1031
01:07:01,273 --> 01:07:03,572
But you have to be proactive.

1032
01:07:03,574 --> 01:07:08,710
Jake shared with me the entire vision
you have to build a Christian college.

1033
01:07:08,712 --> 01:07:10,677
You've got to find someone
to invest in it,

1034
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:14,413
To pay up the debt, to buy this
land so you can put this camp

1035
01:07:14,415 --> 01:07:17,849
I've tried everything. I've
called everyone I know with money

1036
01:07:17,851 --> 01:07:20,985
That could maybe bail me out,
but so far, no one.

1037
01:07:20,987 --> 01:07:25,088
All I have left is
my faith in god.

1038
01:07:25,556 --> 01:07:28,257
Don't you understand?
That's all I have left.

1039
01:07:28,259 --> 01:07:32,226
But what about Jake
and everyone else?

1040
01:07:33,328 --> 01:07:34,027
Jake trusts you.

1041
01:07:34,029 --> 01:07:39,499
He trusts that you and him
are gonna complete this vision.

1042
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:49,039
You're right. You're right. You're
right about the whole situation.

1043
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,608
Yeah. You know what? I'm
gonna tell my family tonight.

1044
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:57,677
It's not fair to hide things
from the ones you love.

1045
01:07:57,679 --> 01:07:59,479
It's just not fair.

1046
01:07:59,481 --> 01:08:00,613
They have the right to know.

1047
01:08:00,615 --> 01:08:01,913
Okay.
You're right.

1048
01:08:01,915 --> 01:08:05,082
No. I want you
to come with me.

1049
01:08:10,388 --> 01:08:13,722
Can I have your
attention, everyone?

1050
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:23,763
In john chapter 8,
the passage states,

1051
01:08:23,765 --> 01:08:28,666
"Then you will know the truth,
and the truth will set you free. "

1052
01:08:28,668 --> 01:08:34,037
Well, I have a confession to
make about god's country.

1053
01:08:34,039 --> 01:08:35,203
We're in foreclosure.

1054
01:08:35,205 --> 01:08:37,439
and as of saturday
we will be no more.

1055
01:08:37,441 --> 01:08:43,244
the land will got to auction
to the highest bidder.

1056
01:08:44,346 --> 01:08:45,644
But the good news is,

1057
01:08:45,646 --> 01:08:47,179
They made us an offer,
and with the money,

1058
01:08:47,181 --> 01:08:49,213
we'll be able to
start over in a new city.

1059
01:08:49,215 --> 01:08:53,550
Sure we can start over in a
different city, but I love this land.

1060
01:08:53,552 --> 01:08:58,954
Wait. Why can't just call the bank and
ask them to work something out with us?

1061
01:08:58,956 --> 01:09:00,989
Because I am the bank.

1062
01:09:02,391 --> 01:09:06,426
And my boss won't
bail you out of debt.

1063
01:09:06,428 --> 01:09:11,831
There are some businessmen and they have
made a very large offer for the land... Jake!

1064
01:09:13,965 --> 01:09:14,965
You lied to me.

1065
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:15,700
I didn't lie to you.

1066
01:09:15,702 --> 01:09:19,035
- I just didn't know how to tell you.
- Lying and not telling

1067
01:09:19,037 --> 01:09:22,171
Are the same thing to me.

1068
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:37,781
Jake, wait.

1069
01:09:40,851 --> 01:09:42,285
It's not her fault.

1070
01:09:42,287 --> 01:09:43,752
Yeah? And whose fault is it?

1071
01:09:43,754 --> 01:09:45,320
You hid this from me!
What about the college?

1072
01:09:45,322 --> 01:09:47,755
what about the vision
that we had?

1073
01:09:47,757 --> 01:09:49,456
- Son, I know...
- Know what?

1074
01:09:49,492 --> 01:09:52,625
That we're losing everything that we've
worked for and you didn't have enough respect

1075
01:09:52,627 --> 01:09:55,794
For me or the workers
to tell us?

1076
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:16,476
Meghan, how could you
do this to us?

1077
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,777
Geri, it's not her fault.

1078
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:20,712
she was just doing her job.

1079
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,446
Eden, how did
all this happen?

1080
01:10:22,448 --> 01:10:27,117
I tried everything
I could to stop this.

1081
01:10:28,485 --> 01:10:31,420
But uh, our time is short.

1082
01:10:31,422 --> 01:10:34,322
I meet with Ms. Doherty
tomorrow

1083
01:10:34,324 --> 01:10:36,556
To finalize
the paperwork.

1084
01:10:36,558 --> 01:10:39,358
So, um,

1085
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,460
Let's enjoy the rest
of the camp.

1086
01:10:41,462 --> 01:10:44,195
Pastor, could you lead us
in prayer?

1087
01:10:44,197 --> 01:10:46,029
Sure.

1088
01:10:49,733 --> 01:10:51,134
Dear heavenly father,

1089
01:10:51,136 --> 01:10:53,301
We ask for your guidance
and your wisdom,

1090
01:10:53,303 --> 01:10:58,439
And that you may pour
your blessing upon your work,

1091
01:10:58,441 --> 01:11:04,343
Your land, and your people.

1092
01:11:08,213 --> 01:11:10,013
In Jesus name we pray.

1093
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,015
amen.

1094
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:14,116
Amen.

1095
01:11:18,354 --> 01:11:20,053
It's okay.

1096
01:11:20,055 --> 01:11:21,755
I'm sorry.

1097
01:11:59,349 --> 01:12:01,316
Hey.

1098
01:12:08,889 --> 01:12:10,557
You know, as long
as I can remember,

1099
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:14,026
This has been my spot to come
and get away from the world,

1100
01:12:14,028 --> 01:12:19,030
Clear my mind from
any worries, doubts,

1101
01:12:20,132 --> 01:12:22,498
Fears.

1102
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,434
I'm sorry.

1103
01:12:27,036 --> 01:12:31,637
I didn't mean to mislead
you why I was here.

1104
01:12:32,573 --> 01:12:34,707
I'm just doing my job.

1105
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:36,908
I should have known.
Right? Like,

1106
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:38,876
Who drives up here
in a Ferrari?

1107
01:12:38,878 --> 01:12:41,245
It's gotta be
a banker or a lawyer,

1108
01:12:41,247 --> 01:12:43,313
Somebody self-Oriented.

1109
01:12:43,315 --> 01:12:44,714
Yeah, that would be me.

1110
01:12:44,716 --> 01:12:49,350
I was exactly that person you
just described when I came here.

1111
01:12:49,352 --> 01:12:51,152
I was on a mission
to close on this deal

1112
01:12:51,154 --> 01:12:56,622
And get back in time to have
drinks with my friends in the city.

1113
01:12:57,057 --> 01:13:00,558
But something changed.

1114
01:13:01,527 --> 01:13:04,261
After seeing all this,

1115
01:13:04,263 --> 01:13:06,429
And you sharing your...

1116
01:13:06,431 --> 01:13:08,798
Your vision with me,

1117
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,898
And meeting everyone,
I understand why

1118
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:14,635
Your father doesn't want
to part with this land.

1119
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:19,471
This really is god's country!

1120
01:13:20,206 --> 01:13:22,674
Look, I know I can't
blame you,

1121
01:13:22,676 --> 01:13:26,309
But I don't
have to like it.

1122
01:14:05,005 --> 01:14:08,840
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1123
01:14:08,842 --> 01:14:10,841
I feel so bad.

1124
01:14:10,843 --> 01:14:15,611
Don't. I realize that you
were just doing your job.

1125
01:14:15,613 --> 01:14:21,085
And that I need to forgive
like Jesus would have.

1126
01:14:27,054 --> 01:14:29,855
Do you want
to forgive me?

1127
01:14:29,857 --> 01:14:33,524
Yes. Yes, I do.

1128
01:14:33,526 --> 01:14:34,858
I really enjoyed
what we shared together.

1129
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:40,262
And I learned that there's a
lesson in every part of life

1130
01:14:40,264 --> 01:14:42,497
And it is not your fault
that this camp is broke.

1131
01:14:42,499 --> 01:14:47,402
That's something that Jake and
Eden and Caroline have to deal with.

1132
01:14:48,504 --> 01:14:53,004
So...
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1133
01:14:53,006 --> 01:14:57,041
Want me to come
for a walk with you?

1134
01:14:57,876 --> 01:14:59,375
I'd rather be by myself.

1135
01:14:59,377 --> 01:15:03,946
I just... I have
a lot to think about.

1136
01:15:19,092 --> 01:15:21,825
you've reached Meghan Doherty.
please leave a message.

1137
01:15:21,827 --> 01:15:23,559
Meghan,
Whitaker痴 furious.

1138
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,561
he plans to come out there
if you don't call in.

1139
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:31,498
your job's at stake. I hope
you're doing the right thing.

1140
01:15:34,568 --> 01:15:39,204
I should just close
the deal and walk away.

1141
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:42,373
That's all you have to do. You've
done it a million times before

1142
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:46,809
And it's gotten you a Ferrari, a
home out in the Hollywood hills,

1143
01:15:46,811 --> 01:15:48,410
I mean,
what more do you need?

1144
01:15:48,412 --> 01:15:53,381
Who cares if I致e taken away
everything that they care about?

1145
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:55,549
Pow!

1146
01:15:56,818 --> 01:16:00,485
When have I ever
cared before?

1147
01:16:02,288 --> 01:16:03,755
Meghan, just stay on task.

1148
01:16:03,757 --> 01:16:08,926
It's not personal. It's...
It's business.

1149
01:16:11,928 --> 01:16:14,062
It's business.

1150
01:16:20,801 --> 01:16:24,336
Hey, pastor Tinsley!

1151
01:16:26,739 --> 01:16:27,505
Meghan.

1152
01:16:27,507 --> 01:16:30,140
How do you feel today?

1153
01:16:30,142 --> 01:16:32,241
Confused.

1154
01:16:32,243 --> 01:16:33,976
Okay, I知 listening.

1155
01:16:33,978 --> 01:16:37,112
Yesterday I felt so bad,
and...

1156
01:16:37,114 --> 01:16:38,545
Today is the last day,

1157
01:16:38,547 --> 01:16:42,148
And I just feel like
the executioner.

1158
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:45,617
You're a good servant. That's all
god wants us to be is good servants.

1159
01:16:45,619 --> 01:16:50,956
I guess I致e just been experiencing
this overwhelming amount of guilt

1160
01:16:52,057 --> 01:16:52,989
These last few days.

1161
01:16:52,991 --> 01:16:56,792
If it's god's will,
then it's his will.

1162
01:16:56,794 --> 01:16:57,893
You're only his messenger.

1163
01:16:57,895 --> 01:17:00,762
I just feel like there's
something that I should do.

1164
01:17:00,764 --> 01:17:04,131
If this is god's will
then it's his will.

1165
01:17:09,635 --> 01:17:12,070
Good luck.

1166
01:17:14,539 --> 01:17:16,239
Everybody ready?

1167
01:17:43,126 --> 01:17:47,561
Hey! Jake! Jake! Jake!

1168
01:17:47,563 --> 01:17:51,130
Jake, listen. Grab
your truck and come with me.

1169
01:17:51,132 --> 01:17:55,297
- What's going on? - I don't have
time to explain. Just follow me.

1170
01:17:55,468 --> 01:17:57,902
Listen, Jake, I know you don;
t trust me, but I have an idea.

1171
01:17:57,904 --> 01:17:59,904
I've had enough of your ideas,
okay? Why should I trust you?

1172
01:17:59,906 --> 01:18:03,740
You standing here mad at me
is not going to save this land.

1173
01:18:03,742 --> 01:18:07,742
Let's go to your room.
Get your business plan.

1174
01:18:07,744 --> 01:18:09,911
I have an idea.

1175
01:18:09,913 --> 01:18:14,480
If you don't trust me,
then trust god.

1176
01:18:16,516 --> 01:18:17,615
Come on.

1177
01:18:17,617 --> 01:18:20,918
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1178
01:18:40,468 --> 01:18:43,935
Meghan, oh my god! Where are
you? We've been worried sick!

1179
01:18:43,937 --> 01:18:47,170
Adam, I知 fine.
tell Whitaker nothing, okay?

1180
01:18:47,172 --> 01:18:48,004
I can't just do that.

1181
01:18:48,006 --> 01:18:51,040
Look, you fell off the face of
the earth. We all have questions.

1182
01:18:51,042 --> 01:18:54,309
call Jason and tell him that
I am on my way bearing gifts.

1183
01:18:54,311 --> 01:18:56,276
okay, my friend?

1184
01:18:56,278 --> 01:18:58,711
Yeah, okay.

1185
01:19:01,248 --> 01:19:02,781
My car.
Take it. It's yours.

1186
01:19:02,783 --> 01:19:07,451
Jason, you told me if I had a
great opportunity, you wanted in.

1187
01:19:07,453 --> 01:19:09,786
What is it?
This is it.

1188
01:19:09,788 --> 01:19:11,721
It's the future.

1189
01:19:11,723 --> 01:19:14,857
I hope you have
your check book.

1190
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:23,629
Hello.

1191
01:19:23,631 --> 01:19:25,564
Mr. Whitaker,
we can no longer wait.

1192
01:19:25,566 --> 01:19:28,900
I thought you said the deal
would be closed by today.

1193
01:19:28,902 --> 01:19:30,300
Hoshi, relax.

1194
01:19:30,302 --> 01:19:33,636
I gave you my word. You
know how these lawyers work,

1195
01:19:33,638 --> 01:19:36,338
Going over all that paperwork.
It takes some time.

1196
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,874
I understand that,
Mr. Whitaker.

1197
01:19:38,876 --> 01:19:40,541
but we had a deal.

1198
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,910
and we agreed upon a deadline.

1199
01:19:42,912 --> 01:19:44,177
Yeah, but...

1200
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:46,079
I値l wait for your call.

1201
01:19:57,388 --> 01:19:58,988
All right, gather around,
folks.

1202
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:00,789
we're gonna start the auction
in about five minutes.

1203
01:20:00,791 --> 01:20:06,727
now, what you're gonna be bidding
on is 1,000 acres of god's country.

1204
01:20:06,729 --> 01:20:12,330
Please, serious bidders only.
Includes three nice trailers,

1205
01:20:12,332 --> 01:20:15,933
Lovely little log cabin,
and a private lake.

1206
01:20:15,935 --> 01:20:21,904
All right, we'll start
the bidding at 75,000.

1207
01:20:24,874 --> 01:20:25,807
Wait!

1208
01:20:25,809 --> 01:20:27,841
- 1,000 acres of...
- No no no! Wait wait wait!

1209
01:20:27,843 --> 01:20:31,410
I got it. I got the payment.
Here you go.

1210
01:20:31,412 --> 01:20:36,114
I'm with Whitaker and associates
and I hereby present to you

1211
01:20:36,116 --> 01:20:39,917
To restore the land
into good standing.

1212
01:20:40,785 --> 01:20:42,118
Everything seems
to be in order.

1213
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:46,955
Sorry, folks,
no auction today.

1214
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:52,625
Thanks.

1215
01:20:54,762 --> 01:21:00,233
Meghan, I hope that smile is
because Whitaker and associates

1216
01:21:06,002 --> 01:21:07,770
No.

1217
01:21:08,038 --> 01:21:10,104
We have a new partner.

1218
01:21:10,406 --> 01:21:11,606
God's country's gonna survive,

1219
01:21:11,608 --> 01:21:14,641
So we can continue to
save lives and give back.

1220
01:21:14,643 --> 01:21:18,144
Do you think the world needs
another casino to take people's

1221
01:21:18,146 --> 01:21:21,279
Why couldn't you build something
that gives back to mankind?

1222
01:21:21,281 --> 01:21:24,582
Meghan, you gotta
be kidding me.

1223
01:21:24,584 --> 01:21:26,082
No, I知 not, sir.

1224
01:21:26,084 --> 01:21:30,052
after spending time here and seeing
what this land was really about,

1225
01:21:30,054 --> 01:21:34,522
I realized I could not be a part
of building a casino out here.

1226
01:21:34,524 --> 01:21:36,823
There are so many other pieces
of land in this vast desert

1227
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:40,159
Where the Yakamoto brothers
can build their casino on.

1228
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:44,429
This little piece of
land, this is too valuable,

1229
01:21:44,431 --> 01:21:47,397
To this camp,
to these people,

1230
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:51,200
And now me.

1231
01:21:54,237 --> 01:21:58,539
You know what?
You're fired.

1232
01:21:58,541 --> 01:22:00,506
I know.

1233
01:22:00,508 --> 01:22:02,108
Meghan, I trusted you

1234
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:06,378
To come up here
and do the right thing!

1235
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,112
And you crossed me?

1236
01:22:08,114 --> 01:22:09,180
I did do the right thing,

1237
01:22:09,182 --> 01:22:14,216
And it took being up here at god's country
and this land to finally realize that.

1238
01:22:14,218 --> 01:22:20,188
Now if you'll excuse me,
we have a college to build.

1239
01:22:40,803 --> 01:22:45,171
Man, I can not believe you
got rid of that sweet ride.

1240
01:22:45,173 --> 01:22:47,741
Listen, I知 gonna be in los
Angeles in a couple of weeks.

1241
01:22:47,743 --> 01:22:51,809
Maybe I can come down
there and we can hang out.

1242
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:53,278
Promise.

1243
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,112
Yes.

1244
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:00,716
Oh, stop it.

1245
01:23:00,718 --> 01:23:02,851
I'm gonna go get the truck.

1246
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,452
All right.

1247
01:23:04,454 --> 01:23:07,021
I'm really gonna miss you.

1248
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:09,188
I told you I want you
to come hang out with me.

1249
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:12,090
Yeah, but you're
just saying that now.

1250
01:23:12,092 --> 01:23:13,191
Promise.

1251
01:23:13,193 --> 01:23:15,626
You're special.

1252
01:23:16,495 --> 01:23:18,562
Thank you.

1253
01:23:19,597 --> 01:23:23,632
Meghan, we're truly
gonna miss you.

1254
01:23:24,401 --> 01:23:26,301
How did you know?

1255
01:23:26,303 --> 01:23:29,569
I didn't. He did.

1256
01:23:36,242 --> 01:23:37,575
You ready to go?

1257
01:23:37,577 --> 01:23:40,244
I am.

1258
01:23:46,716 --> 01:23:51,619
So, partner, you ready to take me back
to the hustle and bustle of city life?

1259
01:23:51,621 --> 01:23:53,420
You know you're always
welcome to stay here.

1260
01:23:53,422 --> 01:23:55,088
You can teach business
finance at the college.

1261
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:59,358
Trust me. I'll be back
to check on my new venture.

1262
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,793
Especially since
I知 officially unemployed.

1263
01:24:01,795 --> 01:24:06,930
Yeah, well, I hope business isn't
the only reason you come back.

1264
01:24:08,032 --> 01:24:12,701
- How about I buy you dinner?
- You know, I know a great sushi place.

1265
01:24:12,703 --> 01:24:16,270
hey, do you have
any plans tomorrow?

1266
01:24:16,272 --> 01:24:19,172
Why? What do you
have in mind?

1267
01:24:28,747 --> 01:24:32,314
Hello? Meghan!

1268
01:24:35,718 --> 01:24:36,451
Oh.

1269
01:24:36,453 --> 01:24:40,654
Well, I can't say
I知 not disappointed.

1270
01:24:41,154 --> 01:24:43,422
Well, I know that you're busy.

1271
01:24:44,258 --> 01:24:49,394
Meghan, can you wait a second?
There's someone at the door.

1272
01:24:50,496 --> 01:24:52,362
Be right back.

1273
01:24:58,201 --> 01:25:00,234
Oh!

1274
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:02,135

Great. These are for you.

1278

Oh, thank you.

1279

Have a great day.

1280
01:25:10,377 --> 01:25:11,975
Bye.
You too.

1281
01:25:15,013 --> 01:25:17,646
Oh, Meghan.

01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:21,883
Okay, I知 back.

1283

I just received the flowers.
How beautiful! Thank you.

1284
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:28,421
At least you didn't
forget about me.

1285
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:32,523
Again? Please hold.

1286

Oh, my god! Meghan!

Jake, thank you.
That's very sweet of you.

You're very welcome. Your
daughter's very important to me

In the little time
I致e known her.

Okay. Ready?
