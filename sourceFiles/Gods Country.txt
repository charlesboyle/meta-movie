1
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:30,587
Four? They're crazy. I should
just get up and walk out right now.

2
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:31,488
Okay, calm down.

3
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,722
Honestly, we put a
solid offer on the table.

4
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:35,724
My clients are selling
for four,

5
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:37,892
Leaving half a million
in equity.

6
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:39,260
Now, this is the deal.

7
00:01:39,262 --> 00:01:40,095
No. No.

8
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:42,963
Richard,
please sit down.

9
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,170
I'll show this to my clients.

10
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:58,373
Don't know if it'll fly,
but we'll see.

11
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:02,009
Hey, how's it going in
there? Anything I can do?

12
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:03,578
Listen. When
bill and Nora leave,

13
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,146
I want you to pop your head
into the conference room

14
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:08,280
And I want you to say
these exact words...

15
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:09,682
"Your clients are leaving. "

16
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:13,384
Sure. Anything else
I need to know?

17
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:15,219
No, not yet.

18
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:18,121
Hmm.

19
00:02:18,123 --> 00:02:19,088
Well?

20
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,223
3.5 million.

21
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,757
We already came down
from four.

22
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,861
We'll only break even if we
agree to three and a half.

23
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:27,761
Do you trust me?

24
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:28,461
We know you're working...

25
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:32,030
As hard as you can to close
this deal, but that Richard guy

26
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:33,098
Is taking
advantage of us.

27
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,634
I know. That's
why if you trust me,

28
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:39,536
I want you to do exactly
what I’m about to tell you.

29
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:40,971
In 10 minutes I need
for you to get up,

30
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:45,974
Walk out of this office, past the
conference room, and out the door.

31
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:49,977
I don't understand. We're
in the middle of negotiating.

32
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:50,777
Trust me.

33
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:54,180
Haven't you ever done something
without knowing the outcome?

34
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:56,982
Wait 10 minutes
and go home.

35
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:58,817
The next time
you'll hear from me

36
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,985
Will be me calling
to congratulate you.

37
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:02,219
do you understand now?

38
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:03,119
Not really.

39
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:07,890
Bill, let's just do
what she asks.

40
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:12,260
'Kay. 10 minutes.

41
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,795
Let me call you back.

42
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:16,529
Well?

43
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,864
Do we have a deal or not?

44
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,700
What is it with you
and this paper?

45
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:27,937
Can't you speak? What did they
say? Do we have a deal or not?

46
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:32,040
You're crazy!
No, they're crazy!

47
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:36,443
4.2 million?
What is going on here?

48
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:38,912
We made a fair offer and
they're going up in price?

49
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:42,047
They're tired of this back
and forth, push and pull.

50
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:45,983
And they said if you do not
agree to it in 10 minutes,

51
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:49,252
The deal's off the table.

52
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:50,653
I don't believe you.

53
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:53,589
3.7 million
is a lot of money.

54
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:57,158
I mean, who's gonna
walk away from that?

55
00:03:58,126 --> 00:04:00,027
Your clients?
They're leaving?

56
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:03,029
They're walking out
of the building right now.

57
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:04,030
Well, I guess that means
the deal's off.

58
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:08,732
What? After all the time
and work I put into this?

59
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:09,266
Go. Go get them.

60
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:11,968
As I explained, they told me
if I didn't come back,

61
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,239
- They were walking.
- Meghan, your clients are leaving.

62
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,808
Okay, four. Four,
and we go to close today.

63
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,110
- Now would you please go get them
before they leave? - Tell my clients

64
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:28,680
I'll send the paperwork
over this afternoon.

65
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:30,515
Okay.

66
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:36,185
It's been a pleasure.

67
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:38,521
Thank you.

68
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:43,123
And congratulations
on a great buy.

69
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:52,663
I just closed
the smith's deal.

70
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:55,966
Good. It's about time. No, I
don't like any of it. Redo it.

71
00:04:55,968 --> 00:05:00,669
You, come with me. There's some
people I want you to meet in my office.

72
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:05,039
Meghan, I would like to introduce
you to the Yakamoto brothers,

73
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,506
Kana and Hoshi Yakamoto.

74
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:11,944
Gentlemen, this
is Meghan Doherty.

75
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:13,511
konichiwa.

76
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,913
konichiwa.

77
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,882
she will be heading
your casino project.

78
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:23,652
Mr. Whitaker, we have
a lot riding on our deal.

79
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:27,655
I understand. Meghan is my top
investment banker here at the firm.

80
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:29,357
We've revised
our business plan

81
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:33,293
To include photos of the
extended land in the Mojave.

82
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:36,128
I have been anticipating these
plans for a few weeks now.

83
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,031
And for out next meeting, we'll
have an outline identifying

84
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:44,467
Risks, and facts
underlining your investment.

85
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:54,007
Now, that was different.

86
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,776
To say the least.

87
00:05:56,778 --> 00:06:00,178
You have your work
cut out for you now.

88
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:02,446
So, are we all
set for tonight?

89
00:06:02,448 --> 00:06:05,548
The decorations are up. The
caterers start serving at 8:00.

90
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,584
Everyone knows to be
at your house by 7:00

91
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:09,251
Or die by the hands
of Meghan Doherty.

92
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:10,419
And Valentina
knows nothing?

93
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:12,153
She thinks
we're doing sushi.

94
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:14,255
I hear you're trying to close

95
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:16,790
on the Yakamoto brothers
casino thing, Randolph.

96
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,659
You think so, al?
We'll see about that.

97
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:21,726
You've been trying to squeeze
our company for years now,

98
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:24,129
And it's not going to work.
We're not giving in.

99
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:28,065
I can't wait to show off
my new outfit tonight.

100
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:28,898
Like always.

101
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,867
Are you implying
that I’m self-Centered?

102
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:33,769
Mmm, that's right.
The same self-Centered friend

103
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:37,338
Who stuck my neck out
to get you a job at the firm.

104
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,605
How quickly we forget.

105
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,140
just remember one thing,
Randolph.

106
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:43,442
I am in first position
on Eden graham's Mojave land.

107
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,777
and I will foreclose
on saturday,

108
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:50,080
and when I do, the Yakamotos
will be knocking on my door.

109
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:54,750
That's the office.
Hold on. Hello?

110
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:57,452
Meghan,
I need you here tonight.

111
00:06:57,454 --> 00:06:59,386
Tonight?

112
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:01,155
it's
Valentina's party.

113
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:05,558
Sir... All right. I'll
be there by 6:00 pm, sir.

114
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,226
I'll have time to stop
at Jason’s of Beverly hills

115
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,694
before I meet with Whitaker.

116
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:13,229
I want to get Valentina
something special.

117
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,999
So what's new
at the firm?

118
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,134
I closed a big one today.

119
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,069
you did? Congratulations!

120
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:22,337
How's your car dealership
going?

121
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:27,406
- Dealership is great. - That's gorgeous.
I have to get a gift for my friend.

122
00:07:29,676 --> 00:07:30,909
Ah, that's beautiful.

123
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:32,344
Any interesting opportunities
you can throw my way?

124
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:37,013
Yeah. One of my clients is thinking of
opening a chain of automatic car washes.

125
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:39,115
That sounds interesting.
I know I did real well

126
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:43,584
Investing in the last exotic
car business you got me turned on

127
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:45,186
So how much?

128
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:46,354
For you, 8,000.

129
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:48,221
That's retail.
What's my price?

130
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,357
Okay, I’ll do 7,500.

131
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,859
Okay. 7,000.
But that's it.

132
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:56,494
Deal.

133
00:07:56,762 --> 00:08:00,530
- How much for that one?
- Normally it's 2,000, but

134
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:01,864
For you, 1,500.

135
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:03,065
Could you box that also?

136
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:06,000
Sure. So how's the Ferrari?

137
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:06,735
Fast.

138
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,901
You know,
that's the only car

139
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:09,136
I don't have
in my dealership,

140
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:12,004
So if you ever want to get that
thing off your hands, let me know.

141
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:14,340
Let go of my pride and joy?
Never.

142
00:08:14,342 --> 00:08:18,676
Jason, you know better
than to ask me that.

143
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:22,445
the Mojave desert.

144
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:28,149
5,000 acres of the Mojave
desert.

145
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:32,352
We are going to build
a casino resort,

146
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:36,355
Including an
18-Hole golf course

147
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:37,623
And a country club.

148
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,391
So what's the catch?

149
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:44,928
Well, Graeme ministries
owns 1,000 acres

150
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,263
Right in the middle of it.

151
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:50,599
The Yakamoto brothers
are going to need

152
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:56,136
This one piece of land
to build their vision upon.

153
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:59,838
Now, this land is already in
foreclosure,

154
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,408
But the owner,
Mr. Eden graham,

155
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,376
Is not cooperating.

156
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,478
And so, this land

157
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,148
Is going to go to auction next saturday.

158
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,548
That doesn't give
us much time.

159
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,317
I know. This guy
absolutely refuses to sell.

160
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:21,587
Therefore I need you
to drive up to the Mojave,

161
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:23,355
And meet with
Mr. Eden graham.

162
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:28,325
Meghan, you
close on this deal,

163
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:31,961
And we'll enjoy
a celebration together.

164
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:33,962
My dream will be realized

165
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:39,634
And guess who will be
in line to fill my shoes?

166
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,876
Hi!

167
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:55,945
Valentina.

168
00:09:55,947 --> 00:09:57,612
I'm sorry I missed
your party.

169
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:59,314
No, you didn't miss it.
You're here now,

170
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:00,948
And this is
how it should be,

171
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,216
Three best friends,
enjoying each other.

172
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:06,853
I knew when Whitaker called you to
his office it would be a late night.

173
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:09,254
We all knew that.

174
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,857
We decided
to wait for you.

175
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:16,693
Oh, guys,
you are so sweet.

176
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:19,895
Oh, I’m acting as if
it's my birthday. Here.

177
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:23,832
Oh my, look
at this bracelet!

178
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:26,133
It's so beautiful!

179
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:27,668
Okay, open.

180
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,168
Okay!

181
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:32,337
Oh!

182
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:33,738
Do you like it?

183
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,905
I love it!

184
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:36,740
Oh, thank you.

185
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:40,109
Look what Adam got me.

186
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:41,877
That is gorgeous!

187
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,813
you must have spent your
entire paycheck on that.

188
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:47,048
Not all of it,
but, yeah, most.

189
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:52,952
Hi, mom.

190
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:55,120
I finally caught you.

191
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:55,854
Let me talk to her.

192
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,956
Mom, I’m gonna give you
a call back tomorrow.

193
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,258
You were supposed to
call me back yesterday.

194
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,727
Good night. I love you.

195
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:09,463
She has the worst timing.
Hmm.

196
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:12,999
I have the biggest deal of
my life and she calls to chit chat?

197
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:16,902
Don't be selfish.
It's your mother.

198
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:19,904
you can't take two minutes
of your time?

199
00:11:19,906 --> 00:11:22,340
Two minutes will
turn into two hours.

200
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:25,609
I just have so much on my mind
with the Yakamoto account.

201
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:27,510
Meghan, ever since
I’ve known you,

202
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:30,645
All you care about is money
and your career.

203
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:32,947
What's going to happen
when you turn 60?

204
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:36,616
You're going to wish that
someone would call and visit you.

205
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:40,585
And guess what? You are
going to be all alone.

206
00:11:40,587 --> 00:11:42,521
You are just as old as I am.

207
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:43,387
But I love my family.

208
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:48,157
And one day I plan to settle
down and have children of my own

209
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,492
So that when I get old
I’ll have someone to love me.

210
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:55,363
Look at you! You don't date and you
have no friends outside of Adam and me.

211
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:56,631
It's late, and
I have to prepare

212
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,533
For the biggest presentation
of my life tomorrow.

213
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:03,435
that's right.
Big presentation.

214
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:06,838
I'll go get my computer
so I can assist.

215
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:18,646
You know that I’m right.

216
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:28,686
Let me google "god's country"
and see what we're working with.

217
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:29,620
What do we have here?

218
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:32,556
"God's country is not
just a getaway.

219
00:12:32,558 --> 00:12:35,224
It's a safe haven for
those who need a break,

220
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:37,293
In the middle of 1,000 acres,

221
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:40,261
We offer the best hiking,
camping...

222
00:12:40,263 --> 00:12:45,798
Run by minister Eden graham,
second generation...

223
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,835
good night.

224
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:26,360
Stupid shoe!

225
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:39,936
Have they made it?

226
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:40,971
Meghan, where are you?

227
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:42,172
have they made it?

228
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:42,939
They are here now.

229
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:45,874
- Okay. - And Mr. Whitaker is walking
them into the conference room.

230
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:50,077
- Why didn't you wake me?
- I've been calling you all morning.

231
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,512
I had research put something
together. It's on your desk.

232
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:58,350
Okay. Offer them coffee, tea,
something to drink. Stall them.

233
00:13:58,352 --> 00:14:00,185
You want me to go
into the conference room?

234
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:04,988
- But I...
- I don't have time for these questions!

235
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,023
Just do it!

236
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,491
Okay.

237
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:12,293
Who do you like better?
You like Matsui or Ichiro?

238
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:15,295
Uh, Meghan is a couple
of minutes away.

239
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:20,432
She asked me to offer you
something to drink.

240
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:21,165
Coffee? Water? Tea?

241
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:26,236
Tell Ms. Daugherty we prefer
her presence instead of drinks.

242
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:31,307
But since you're here,
bring all of the above.

243
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,342
Yes, sir.

244
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:39,445
Anyway, my favorite player
is Hideki Matsui.

245
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:54,556
They're waiting for you.
I stalled as long as I could.

246
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:56,824
Here's your material.

247
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:58,925
Oh, uh...

248
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:06,231
Gentlemen.

249
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,133
Thank you for coming.

250
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:11,635
Shall we get down
to business?

251
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:18,306
We've identified your prospectus
and have done and evaluation

252
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:19,974
Keeping in mind
the growth rate

253
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:21,442
Of
the surrounding Mojave area.

254
00:15:21,444 --> 00:15:26,145
We see your casino not only
as gambling for adults,

255
00:15:26,147 --> 00:15:27,913
And we believe you have
an entertainment portal.

256
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:33,384
We see the profit potential at
a capture of 40% lift annually.

257
00:15:34,486 --> 00:15:37,086
Your investment over
the course of 10 years

258
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:40,055
Will yield an
annual $2 million,

259
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:43,791
Which by year eight, from
your profit, your interest,

260
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:46,527
And neighboring leases, your
investment will be paid back in full.

261
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:50,696
We at Whitaker and associates would love
to team up with the Yakamoto brothers

262
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:56,067
To turn the Mojave desert into one
of America’s most impressive casinos.

263
00:15:56,069 --> 00:16:01,136
Whitaker and associates is the most
qualified financial organization

264
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:05,606
To bring your astonishing
vision to reality.

265
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:08,141
Thank you.

266
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,609
excellent.

267
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:12,078
very good job.

268
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:15,547
arigato.

269
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,215
I'm sorry. Could someone
translate for me?

270
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:20,983
I just complimented Ms. Doherty

271
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:23,453
On her presentation.

272
00:16:24,954 --> 00:16:27,355
Excellent.

273
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:35,260
Did you see the look
on their faces?

274
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,795
I did.

275
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:37,763
We really won them over.

276
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:40,665
You know, Meghan, I don't hand
out compliments too easily,

277
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,866
But you were outstanding
today and I mean that.

278
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,168
But before we start
blowing our own horn here,

279
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,436
We still have some
unfinished business.

280
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:50,905
Walk with me to my car.

281
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:52,873
All right, let's not
waste any time with this.

282
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,541
I want you to get up there
as early as tomorrow.

283
00:16:54,543 --> 00:16:59,644
Have you assistant call ahead
and set up a meeting with graham.

284
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:01,580
And Meghan,

285
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:03,714
Do not pull any punches
with this guy.

286
00:17:03,716 --> 00:17:05,282
Let him know
that you mean business,

287
00:17:05,284 --> 00:17:06,816
That nothing,
and I mean nothing,

288
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,486
Will stop Whitaker and
associates from closing that deal.

289
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,854
'Cause you know what?
I can feel it.

290
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:14,655
God is on our side,
so you close this.

291
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:29,265
Hello?

292
00:17:29,268 --> 00:17:33,034
I thought maybe I’d have a chance
to speak with my only child.

293
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:36,470
But she's always too busy
for her only mother.

294
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,105
Sorry, mother.
I've been swamped at work.

295
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:42,609
Well, it must be going well. I
received another check in the mail.

296
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:43,575
What are you doing?

297
00:17:43,577 --> 00:17:48,446
Every week the church hands out
food donations to senior citizens.

298
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:51,915
So I’m headed on over
to the retirement home,

299
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:54,350
Which is where I’ll be
living in a couple of years.

300
00:17:54,352 --> 00:17:55,484
Ma, come on. You
make me feel so guilty.

301
00:17:55,486 --> 00:18:01,054
Well, you should. What has it been,
almost six months since I’ve seen you?

302
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:02,422
You know what this coming
weekend is.

303
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:07,159
No, ma, I don't know what
this coming weekend is.

304
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:12,363
It's my birthday, Meghan.

305
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:18,133
Listen, Pasadena is not
that far from los Angeles,

306
00:18:18,135 --> 00:18:22,503
So I don't want to hear any excuses,
and I don't want another check from you.

307
00:18:22,505 --> 00:18:26,339
I want to be with
my daughter on my birthday.

308
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:30,476
Okay, ma, I will be with
you on your birthday.

309
00:18:30,478 --> 00:18:33,278
I promise.

310
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:38,514
Cross your heart?

311
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:39,949
Cross my heart.

312
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:45,052
Ha! Oh, I’m so excited
I’m gonna see you finally!

313
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:46,887
I love you.

314
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:49,289
Love you too, mom.

315
00:18:53,927 --> 00:18:55,726
All right.

316
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:25,048
Hello, Adam.

317
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,515
Meghan, hey.

318
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:29,184
Mr. Whitaker asked me
to get you on the phone.

319
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:33,286
- Hold that note.
- You get Meghan on the phone yet?

320
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:34,988
- What does he want to talk about?
- Yes, sir.

321
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,524
- Adam, wait... - Hello, Meghan.
You're heading up there, I hope.

322
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:42,092
- Yes, sir. I should be there in a
couple of hours. - Good. Listen to me.

323
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:45,195
The Yakamoto brothers are
scheduled to fly back into town

324
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:46,329
This thursday
to finalize everything.

325
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:50,131
I'm counting on you. I am depending
on you to take care of this.

326
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:52,133
Don't plan. Do it.
Yes, sir. I plan to.

327
00:19:52,135 --> 00:19:54,668
Call me the second you have
your meeting with graham.

328
00:19:54,670 --> 00:20:00,339
Do not leave his side without
signing those documents.

329
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:03,507
Bye.

330
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:21,454
"Close it. "

331
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:23,489
I'll close it.
I'll show him.

332
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:27,325
I'll make partner
and force him to retire.

333
00:20:40,936 --> 00:20:43,637
Where am I?

334
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:47,840
Okay...

335
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:50,475
I'll find it.

336
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:20,195
Whoo!

337
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:54,156
Paris Hilton ain't got nothin'
on you, girl!

338
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:56,258
Da-Da-Da-Da!

339
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,692
I'm sorry, ma'am...

340
00:21:57,694 --> 00:21:58,526
Don't touch the car!

341
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:03,063
Ma'am, it's not every day
that a Ferrari pulls up.

342
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:04,863
Hoo!

343
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:08,833
Hey, my name is Lenny. I'm
one of the counselors here.

344
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:12,002
- Okay...
- I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.

345
00:22:12,004 --> 00:22:12,903
I didn't give
my name to you.

346
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:16,205
Listen, I’m looking for
Mr. Graham. Is he around?

347
00:22:16,207 --> 00:22:18,206
Mr. Graham is always around.

348
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,041
Well then, can you
get him for me?

349
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:23,077
I'll be right back.

350
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,415
hey, uh, Mr. Graham,

351
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:33,184
There's a woman out here
with a Ferrari.

352
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,752
really? Where's she from?

353
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,320
My name is Doherty.

354
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,821
Where...
Where is she from?

355
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:43,458
Mrs. Doubtfire, he wants
to know where you're from.

356
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:45,258
Doherty.

357
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,627
- My name is Doherty.
- Huh?

358
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:50,262
I'm from Whitaker
and associates.

359
00:22:50,264 --> 00:22:51,830
Whitak... Oh, just...
Huh?

360
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:54,965
- I'm sorry, ma'am. I just
don't understand what you're...

361
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:57,167
Mr. Graham,
this is Meghan Doherty.

362
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:58,868
I'm with Whitaker
and associates.

363
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,137
My assistant
called yesterday.

364
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:02,404
Hello, Mr. Graham?

365
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:04,239
Mr. Graham?
Ma'am. Ma'am.

366
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:05,106
What?
Ma'am!

367
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:08,908
If you want to talk
to Mr. Graham,

368
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,077
You have to push
that button right there.

369
00:23:12,178 --> 00:23:14,279
Where is his office?

370
00:23:14,948 --> 00:23:17,315
Where is his office?

371
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,818
Incompetent people.

372
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,587
ooh, that's a nice ride!

373
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:32,892
Hoo!

374
00:23:48,305 --> 00:23:51,506
One fancy automobile.

375
00:23:55,877 --> 00:23:58,475
- Mr. Graham.
- What? No, give me a hug.

376
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:01,880
There we go.

377
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:03,780
- Ms. Doherty?
- Doherty. Meghan Doherty.

378
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:06,083
- Good to meet you. This is pastor Tinsley.
- How do you do?

379
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:10,086
- Pastor Tinsley, what do you think?
- Breathtaking.

380
00:24:10,087 --> 00:24:13,988
Pastor Tinsley’s church is gonna
be our guest all this week at camp.

381
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,792
Mr. Graham, is there someplace
we can speak in private?

382
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:21,226
Well, sure.

383
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:22,928
Right this way.

384
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,266
Ahem.

385
00:24:36,739 --> 00:24:39,373
Have a seat.

386
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,541
I need to get right
to the point.

387
00:24:40,543 --> 00:24:45,811
As you know, we're the lender in
second position on your property.

388
00:24:45,813 --> 00:24:51,714
Mr. Whitaker sent me down here to discuss
your property in its current state.

389
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:57,352
You're in foreclosure, set to
go to auction this saturday.

390
00:24:57,354 --> 00:25:01,422
Since we don't want to risk anyone
else attempting to buy your property,

391
00:25:01,424 --> 00:25:06,125
I'm here to make you an offer
and close on this deal today.

392
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:07,660
Hmm. It's funny...

393
00:25:07,662 --> 00:25:09,327
I spoke to one of you
people the other day.

394
00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:12,162
Now Whitaker’s sending somebody
down here to patronize me?

395
00:25:12,164 --> 00:25:16,098
Mr. Graham, I am not
patronizing you.

396
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,434
I'm here to make you
a serious cash offer,

397
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:22,970
An offer I know
is more than fair.

398
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:26,406
Look, you're behind
in monthly payments,

399
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:30,075
Behind on your taxes.
We're just trying to help.

400
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:35,413
All you have to do is sign the
power of ownership over to us

401
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:39,648
- And we can handle the rest.
- Ms. Doherty,

402
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,117
I may be a little late
paying this mortgage,

403
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,452
But I serve an on-Time god,

404
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:47,554
And he will deliver us from this
financial hold your bank has on us.

405
00:25:47,556 --> 00:25:51,190
- Mr. Graham...
- Do you know anything about this place?

406
00:25:51,192 --> 00:25:54,092
Or are you just down
here to earn a commission?

407
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,394
I'm here to do you a favor.

408
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,265
Follow me.

409
00:26:08,404 --> 00:26:10,604
I'd like to take you on
a little tour of the camp.

410
00:26:10,606 --> 00:26:14,373
A tour is not going to change
the position you're in.

411
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:18,476
Come on. What do you
have to lose?

412
00:26:40,427 --> 00:26:41,225
Hmmm.

413
00:26:41,227 --> 00:26:45,161
I’m second-Generation
land owner of graham holdings.

414
00:26:45,163 --> 00:26:45,896
my dad was a minister.

415
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,464
I use this land
to give back to god,

416
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:53,401
For me rebelling against his
righteous ways when I was a kid.

417
00:26:56,638 --> 00:26:58,204
Look at it.

418
00:26:58,206 --> 00:27:02,307
I love this land.

419
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:05,543
There's no place like it.

420
00:27:05,545 --> 00:27:10,914
Our ministry has taken a big hit,
just as I’m sure residential has.

421
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:13,515
Churches can't tithe
the way they used to

422
00:27:13,517 --> 00:27:15,216
Or pay extras for the kids,

423
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:18,319
And that trickles down
to people like us.

424
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:24,224
Meghan you can tell Whitaker
I have to decline his offer.

425
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:29,059
Listen, the deal
is the deal.

426
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:32,029
You can pray to your god
any time, day or night,

427
00:27:32,031 --> 00:27:37,399
But it's not gonna stop the fact that
out bank is gonna take this property.

428
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,100
take me back to my car.

429
00:27:51,944 --> 00:27:55,412
Meghan, I’ll tell you what.

430
00:27:55,414 --> 00:27:59,481
I'd be willing to put my faith
that god will come through

431
00:27:59,483 --> 00:28:01,382
And this will all be
water under the bridge.

432
00:28:01,384 --> 00:28:06,686
If you'll just stay here
for six days.

433
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:08,721
See what it is we do here.

434
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:10,422
Watch god's blessings unfold.

435
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:15,594
And then if by some chance you don't
see why this land is so important,

436
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:20,096
I'll sign your deal before
the land goes to auction

437
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,764
So you can get your
big commission check.

438
00:28:22,766 --> 00:28:25,666
Listen, take the check,

439
00:28:25,668 --> 00:28:27,400
Gather your Christian folk,

440
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:31,704
And go build a church
in a new location.

441
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:35,707
Near a city where
people actually live.

442
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:37,908
Ms. Doherty,

443
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,010
I know as long as I don't put
my signature on that document,

444
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:44,713
I have a fighting chance to
keep what's rightfully mine.

445
00:28:44,715 --> 00:28:48,949
No, it's not over
till god says it's over.

446
00:28:48,951 --> 00:28:52,552
And god hasn't
told me anything.

447
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,953
All right.

448
00:28:53,955 --> 00:28:58,589
So, why would me staying here
for six days

449
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:01,158
Make any difference in whether
or not you sign this deal?

450
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,361
You'll be able to see what
we do here with your own eyes.

451
00:29:04,363 --> 00:29:09,197
Maybe then you'll understand why
I’m willing to put my faith in god

452
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:12,399
And fight to keep this place
open to help people in need.

453
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:17,803
To you, this is just another
business deal. This is my whole life.

454
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:22,039
If it's more money you want, let me
call Mr. Whitaker. Let's up the offer.

455
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:27,045
You have my offer. Six days and I’ll
sign. That's my promise to you and to god.

456
00:29:29,246 --> 00:29:32,847
One condition. The deal
remains between you and me.

457
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:33,714
You can't tell anybody else.

458
00:29:33,716 --> 00:29:36,182
I don't want people around
here to judge or treat you

459
00:29:36,184 --> 00:29:39,818
Any differently than
the rest of the guests.

460
00:29:44,923 --> 00:29:46,523
All right.

461
00:29:46,525 --> 00:29:49,291
Deal.

462
00:29:51,662 --> 00:29:52,794
Okay.

463
00:29:52,796 --> 00:29:56,330
I just need to make a few calls.

464
00:30:16,513 --> 00:30:18,012
Meghan.

465
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:21,381
You scared the living
daylights out of me.

466
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:23,783
Sorry. We have a camp
meeting in five minutes.

467
00:30:23,785 --> 00:30:28,720
About this deal, I need to go
and make a call to my office.

468
00:30:28,722 --> 00:30:30,821
I need to go home and
get some extra clothing,

469
00:30:30,823 --> 00:30:33,290
Because the only clothing
I have is what I’m wearing.

470
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:36,626
now, do you have a phone
in your office I can use?

471
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:39,161
Five minutes. And you can
leave all your stuff in the car.

472
00:30:39,163 --> 00:30:43,497
No one's gonna mess
with it. Five minutes.

473
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:57,140
Hasn't anyone ever told them
that staring isn't polite?

474
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:03,078
Meghan, listen, why don't you
join my church's congregation?

475
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,279
You can be
our special guest.

476
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:08,948
Maybe you could teach my kids a little
something about whatever it is that you do.

477
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,550
They love your car.

478
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:12,284
Sure. Whatever you say.

479
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:13,485
Awesome. Thank you.

480
00:31:14,121 --> 00:31:18,189
I guess somebody didn't get the
memo about appropriate attire.

481
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:20,724
I'm Jacob. Everyone
around here calls me Jake.

482
00:31:20,726 --> 00:31:25,359
Well, Jacob, you can keep your
smart comments to yourself.

483
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:27,495
Look, I just saw you walk
in here with my father,

484
00:31:27,497 --> 00:31:29,129
And I can tell by the
way that you're dressed

485
00:31:29,131 --> 00:31:32,431
That you're obviously not one
of the church group leaders.

486
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:33,232
So, why are you here?

487
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:37,001
I'm here for the same reason
as everyone else. Enlightenment.

488
00:31:37,003 --> 00:31:39,136
Now I don't know
who you are, but...

489
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:42,939
I'm sorry, did you just say
that was your father?

490
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:45,441
Yeah. I run this place
with my parents.

491
00:31:45,443 --> 00:31:48,043
I'm the head counselor here.

492
00:31:48,045 --> 00:31:49,677
Sorry. Meghan Doherty.

493
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,114
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to god's country.

494
00:31:54,116 --> 00:31:58,317
I want you to shake away all the
worries of your day-To-Day rat race

495
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,586
And peer pressure, and
especially video games,

496
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:03,186
Social networking, and uh...

497
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,622
Texting.

498
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,657
You're here to relax,
make friends,

499
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:13,293
And most of all, discover that real
inner love of self and god's spirit.

500
00:32:13,295 --> 00:32:18,765
Before we begin, I want you to turn
to the person to your right and left,

501
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:22,367
And give them a big
welcoming hug.

502
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:25,803
Hey.
Oh!

503
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:30,906
Okay.

504
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:32,975
Oh my...

505
00:32:33,544 --> 00:32:38,211
Meghan, I’d like to introduce
my better half over here

506
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:42,014
For almost 25 years now,
Caroline.

507
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:45,150
She's sort of the mother hen,
caretaker of the camp.

508
00:32:45,152 --> 00:32:50,254
So if you get sick, bitten, or
just plain homesick, she's...

509
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:50,987
Honey, stop it.
Bitten?

510
00:32:50,989 --> 00:32:53,990
He's just pulling your leg.
If it was the summer time, yes,

511
00:32:53,992 --> 00:32:57,691
But in the cooler months
we don't have that problem.

512
00:32:57,693 --> 00:32:58,993
Good to know.

513
00:32:58,995 --> 00:33:00,027
Oh, hey, Meghan,
this is Geri.

514
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:04,097
- She's one of the counselors here.
You guys should... - Hi.

515
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:05,330
Are you a model?

516
00:33:05,332 --> 00:33:06,331
You're so pretty.

517
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:09,066
I know your feet must be
killing you in those high heels.

518
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:10,401
Geri, go fetch Meghan
a pair of your boots.

519
00:33:10,403 --> 00:33:12,736
- No.
- They'll probably be a little too big,

520
00:33:12,738 --> 00:33:15,538
But they'll give your feet
a much needed rest.

521
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:21,376
Just show me to my room so I can get
on my laptop and make a few calls,

522
00:33:21,378 --> 00:33:22,643
And I’ll be awesome.

523
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:27,213
Meghan, you're kind of missing the point
of what we do here in god's country.

524
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:28,814
And that is...

525
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:30,215
Off the grid.

526
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,550
Here you go.

527
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,617
Anyway, welcome aboard.

528
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:37,253
Grudge match. Ping pong.
Let's go. Want to watch?

529
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:38,288
I'm gonna watch.

530
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,055
Those are for you.

531
00:33:40,057 --> 00:33:41,423
I'll take you
to your trailer.

532
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:42,924
You're gonna want those.

533
00:33:42,926 --> 00:33:44,358
I'm not wearing them.

534
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,093
My trailer?

535
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,603
What is this?

536
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,572
this is your living quarters.

537
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,239
sorry it's not
the plaza hotel.

538
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:06,841
I am not staying in that.

539
00:34:06,843 --> 00:34:12,379
Well, it's stay in that
trailer, or in the house with all

540
00:34:15,315 --> 00:34:17,782
Here or there.

541
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:42,566
What have I gotten
myself into?

542
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:59,011
Gross!

543
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,250
Get off!

544
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:21,227
What are you doing,
stalking me?

545
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:24,096
No, I just came by
to see if you were okay.

546
00:35:24,098 --> 00:35:25,363
I am not okay!

547
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:29,499
I hear these things howling at
me and there was this big bug...

548
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:31,167
Wait. A bug?

549
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:35,137
Yes! Are you laughing at me?

550
00:35:36,572 --> 00:35:38,106
Wait a minute.

551
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:39,506
What are you doing?

552
00:35:39,508 --> 00:35:42,009
Hey, mom?

553
00:35:42,011 --> 00:35:42,742
yeah, honey.

554
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:45,411
Can you send Geri to
trailer number one, please?

555
00:35:45,413 --> 00:35:47,946
what's up, Jake?

556
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:51,582
It's Meghan.
And a bug.

557
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:52,782
It was a big bug.
Big.

558
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:57,886
Sorry. A big bug attacked her, and
now she refuses to go to the trailer.

559
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:00,054
you want me to send someone
to stay with her?

560
00:36:00,056 --> 00:36:04,691
- Affirmative.
- okay, honey. I'll tell Geri. bye bye.

561
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:07,393
Thanks.

562
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:15,065
It was a big, big bug.

563
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:18,367
It's all clear.

564
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:20,235
Hi again.

565
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:21,803
Are you always so petulant?

566
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:26,073
Oh. They actually said that you
needed a little help out here

567
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:28,074
So we're gonna be
roommates now.

568
00:36:28,076 --> 00:36:29,242
I hope that's okay.

569
00:36:29,244 --> 00:36:30,575
You're not too adjusted
to the wild, huh?

570
00:36:30,577 --> 00:36:34,845
- That's okay.
- Well, now you have your bodyguard.

571
00:36:34,847 --> 00:36:36,514
Thank you.

572
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:38,748
Okay.

573
00:36:38,883 --> 00:36:41,016
Okay, this is for you.

574
00:36:41,018 --> 00:36:42,051
What is this?

575
00:36:42,053 --> 00:36:44,953
Mr. Graham said that you
needed some clothes to wear,

576
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:46,821
So I just brought you
some of my own.

577
00:36:46,823 --> 00:36:49,790
I'm not wearing that.

578
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:55,060
We don't get any signals
out here.

579
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:57,661
What, are you guys
in the 1800's?

580
00:36:57,663 --> 00:37:00,063
- How do you live like this?
- Live like what?

581
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:02,665
Like this. No cell phone,
Wi-Fi.

582
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:04,566
What are you
supposed to be proving?

583
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:06,501
We're not trying
to prove anything.

584
00:37:06,503 --> 00:37:10,471
We're actually just
in the middle of nowhere.

585
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,140
What?
Hey, Meghan.

586
00:37:14,142 --> 00:37:18,376
Do you mind if we just say a quick
prayer before we head in for the night?

587
00:37:18,378 --> 00:37:19,911
Pray on.

588
00:37:19,913 --> 00:37:21,745
Okay.

589
00:37:25,149 --> 00:37:27,683
you've reached Meghan Doherty.
please leave a message.

590
00:37:27,685 --> 00:37:31,319
Meghan, bet you wrapped
graham and those documents

591
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:32,619
Around your
little finger today.

592
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:35,855
I can't wait to hear
about it. Call me.

593
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,729
Meghan, wake up!

594
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:46,663
Meghan. Meghan. Meghan.

595
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:49,465
Wake up, sleepyhead!

596
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:50,499
Rise and shine

597
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,968
d and kick out
the glory, glory d

598
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,336
What time is it?

599
00:37:55,338 --> 00:37:56,470
It's 6:00.

600
00:37:56,472 --> 00:37:58,404
- 6:00 a. m.?
- Yeah.

601
00:37:58,474 --> 00:38:03,576
Come back at 10:00 a. m.
I don't do breakfast.

602
00:38:12,815 --> 00:38:15,517
Geri, where's Meghan?

603
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:18,419
She wouldn't get up.

604
00:38:20,354 --> 00:38:24,823
Jake, will you ask pastor Tinsley to
start this morning's prayer service?

605
00:38:24,825 --> 00:38:26,091
Yeah, you got it.

606
00:38:26,093 --> 00:38:28,626
Thanks. Be right back.

607
00:38:28,727 --> 00:38:32,896
All right, y'all, how's
everybody doing today?

608
00:38:48,141 --> 00:38:49,007
What is wrong with you?

609
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:50,741
We're having prayer
before breakfast

610
00:38:50,743 --> 00:38:52,410
And you have to join
your assigned group.

611
00:38:52,412 --> 00:38:55,578
Listen. I'm tired. I
am not going anywhere.

612
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,348
And I have agreed to
stay here for six days.

613
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:02,050
You agreed to be part
of the journey.

614
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:04,451
Being part of the journey
means taking the journey.

615
00:39:04,453 --> 00:39:08,154
Now if you don't show up for your
assigned group, our agreement's off.

616
00:39:08,156 --> 00:39:12,424
You can get back in your fancy car
and drive back to los Angeles today.

617
00:39:12,426 --> 00:39:16,960
Okay. I get your point. Let
me just go take a shower...

618
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:22,631
No time for that. You gotta meet your
group. Breakfast is in 15 minutes.

619
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:27,535
Get up, throw some water on
your face, I’ll see you out here.

620
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,412
Jake, do we know
where your father is?

621
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:48,083
There she is.

622
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:26,809
Meghan, I thought we could
all sit down together,

623
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:29,078
And eat as a family.

624
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:36,683
Let's bow our heads
in prayer.

625
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:39,919
And Jesus said unto them,
"I am the bread of life,

626
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:42,754
He that cometh to me
shall never hunger

627
00:40:42,756 --> 00:40:46,891
And he that believeth
on me shall never thirst.

628
00:40:46,893 --> 00:40:49,025
amen.
Amen.

629
00:40:49,027 --> 00:40:51,193
Now we can eat.

630
00:40:56,132 --> 00:40:59,700
All right, gang, remember
this is a contest

631
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:00,933
So there are special
reward activities

632
00:41:00,935 --> 00:41:03,202
For the group that pulls
together and does the best job.

633
00:41:03,204 --> 00:41:07,838
The first activity is a two-Mile
hike up to the tennis courts.

634
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,341
Lenny, it's all you, buddy.

635
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:11,774
Wait.
You all right?

636
00:41:11,843 --> 00:41:14,576
I am not dressed for a two-Mile
hike out in this jungle.

637
00:41:14,578 --> 00:41:16,712
I'd actually be more
worried about the snakes.

638
00:41:16,714 --> 00:41:22,149
come on, I’m
just kidding with you.

639
00:41:22,151 --> 00:41:24,417
I got your back.

640
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:28,953
You're gonna be
all right.

641
00:41:28,955 --> 00:41:30,088
Thank you.

642
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,189
Okay, let's go for a hike!

643
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:44,965
you've reached Meghan Doherty.
please leave a message.

644
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:47,400
hola, Meghan, you've been
gone for two days now.

645
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:49,635
We all know when you're working on
a big deal you stop communicating,

646
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:54,673
But you missed our weekly facial
appointment today, and that's not like you.

647
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:59,642
Okay, call me. Bye.

648
00:42:02,511 --> 00:42:06,513
Group three, we're here,
and you might notice

649
00:42:06,515 --> 00:42:09,282
That there are
no tennis rackets. But,

650
00:42:09,284 --> 00:42:13,552
We do have these.

651
00:42:13,554 --> 00:42:16,887
Oh, no.

652
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:19,923
It is bad enough
that we hiked two miles,

653
00:42:19,925 --> 00:42:21,324
And now you expect us
to work?

654
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:24,026
Come on. It'll be fun.
You'll have fun.

655
00:42:24,028 --> 00:42:26,228
We're gonna
clean this place up.

656
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,361
We're gonna get it nice
and beautiful.

657
00:42:27,363 --> 00:42:32,999
What is fun about hiking two
miles to clean a tennis court?

658
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,301
It's not about the work.

659
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,602
It's about us working
together as a team.

660
00:42:37,604 --> 00:42:40,871
I can't believe
what I’m hearing.

661
00:42:40,873 --> 00:42:44,106
It's like you're brainwashed.

662
00:42:49,378 --> 00:42:50,377
Okay.

663
00:42:50,379 --> 00:42:51,111
We'll start on this end,

664
00:42:51,113 --> 00:42:53,780
And we gotta
work our way back.

665
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,882
Let's do it!

666
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:27,905
Hey, Meghan.
Everything okay?

667
00:43:27,907 --> 00:43:30,540
No. What do kids learn
from hiking two miles

668
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:32,140
Up to a tennis court
covered in weeds,

669
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:36,377
And guess what? Here are some gloves and
shovels and let's clean the tennis court

670
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:38,945
And learn about the good lord. Hmmm.

671
00:43:38,947 --> 00:43:42,615
- Calm down.
- I am not going to calm down!

672
00:43:42,617 --> 00:43:46,083
Why don't you just sign this document?
Just give up already.

673
00:43:46,086 --> 00:43:48,619
There's nothing you can do
to save this land.

674
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:51,755
I get it that you are a man of
god and you live off this and,

675
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:55,024
But I don't see a miracle
that's gonna come out of the sky

676
00:43:55,026 --> 00:43:57,292
And save this place!

677
00:43:57,294 --> 00:43:58,892
You done?

678
00:43:58,894 --> 00:44:00,127
No. Do you want
more money?

679
00:44:00,129 --> 00:44:03,496
'Cause if you want more money,
I could get you more money.

680
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:05,164
What is it that you want?

681
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,298
Ms. Doherty...

682
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,599
We have an agreement.

683
00:44:07,601 --> 00:44:10,167
I plan to stick to my end
if you stick to yours.

684
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:15,338
Now if you don't get back
to your group, deal's off.

685
00:44:23,144 --> 00:44:24,945
Oh!

686
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:40,956
Well, welcome back!

687
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:57,434
I need a facial
and a makeover so bad.

688
00:44:57,436 --> 00:45:00,304
Wow, you look so
different.

689
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:02,805
You look really pretty
without makeup.

690
00:45:03,775 --> 00:45:09,343
Oh, my body hurts so bad.

691
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:13,046
Have you ever had a facial
or...?

692
00:45:13,048 --> 00:45:15,881
no.
No.

693
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:18,349
Sit right there.

694
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,054
'Kay.

695
00:45:26,823 --> 00:45:30,491
You have pretty healthy skin.
You should take care of it.

696
00:45:30,493 --> 00:45:32,092
Oh, I wash it with soap.

697
00:45:32,094 --> 00:45:33,960
Soap?

698
00:45:33,962 --> 00:45:37,096
Soap is the harshest thing
on a lady's skin. Huh-Uh.

699
00:45:37,098 --> 00:45:42,934
My friend Valentina and I,
we get a facial once a week.

700
00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:45,535
Oh.

701
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:50,038
I feel like my
face is cracking.

702
00:45:53,775 --> 00:45:55,475
Want to see?

703
00:46:12,023 --> 00:46:14,956
Good morning!

704
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:17,991
what time is it?

705
00:46:17,993 --> 00:46:20,426
5:45.

706
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:22,828
Why do we have to get up
so early?

707
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:27,932
"Early to bed, early to rise, makes
a girl healthy, wealthy, and wise. "

708
00:46:27,934 --> 00:46:29,666
All right, I know that's
not in the bible.

709
00:46:29,668 --> 00:46:34,803
How did you sleep? Gosh,
last night was so special.

710
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:39,240
Just, it was like almost
like I had a sister.

711
00:46:42,043 --> 00:46:43,542
Ow!

712
00:46:43,544 --> 00:46:44,310
Are you okay?

713
00:46:44,312 --> 00:46:47,545
It feels like someone's
poured concrete down my back.

714
00:46:47,547 --> 00:46:50,447
- Oh no!
- Listen, why don't you just go ahead

715
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:55,552
And tell Mr. Graham that I can't
get out of bed because my back hurts.

716
00:46:56,654 --> 00:46:59,087
Just go ahead.

717
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,813
hello, Meghan?

718
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:40,950
My dad asked me
to come check on you.

719
00:47:41,918 --> 00:47:47,722
Meghan, are you all right?

720
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:52,358
I'm gonna come in.
Are you dressed?

721
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:56,027
Ow! Ow!

722
00:47:56,962 --> 00:47:59,029
Ow!

723
00:47:59,031 --> 00:47:59,997
Are you okay?

724
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,131
Oh, I’m all right.

725
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:04,867
I just strained my back
from pulling weeds yesterday.

726
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:06,835
I thought I had some
ibuprofen in the car.

727
00:48:06,837 --> 00:48:08,003
Well come on, let's
get you some aspirin.

728
00:48:08,005 --> 00:48:12,672
You wouldn't happen to know where
there would be a phone I could use.

729
00:48:12,674 --> 00:48:15,608
Yeah, well, the only phone's
in my father's office.

730
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:20,178
Other than that the closest phone's
about 10 miles away in the nearest town.

731
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,578
- I could ask him if you like.
- Oh. Oh, no.

732
00:48:22,581 --> 00:48:25,749
I guess I could drive you to
town if it's that important.

733
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:27,616
Yes, it is that important.

734
00:48:27,618 --> 00:48:28,717
Just far enough until
I get some cell signal,

735
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:31,119
- And then I could make the call.
- Yeah, sure.

736
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:35,055
Come on. We'll take my car
and we'll be back before lunch.

737
00:48:35,057 --> 00:48:37,256
Yeah, all right.

738
00:48:57,638 --> 00:48:58,405
Where are
you guys headed?

739
00:48:58,407 --> 00:49:01,774
She needed to make an important
call and use the phone.

740
00:49:01,776 --> 00:49:04,075
I didn't want to bother you.

741
00:49:04,077 --> 00:49:07,110
Is that right, Meghan?

742
00:49:07,112 --> 00:49:08,378
Yeah.

743
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,746
That's right.

744
00:49:17,986 --> 00:49:19,053
You okay?

745
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:22,889
Yeah. All of a sudden
I just feel sick.

746
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:26,358
Maybe carol can help you
with her sudden sickness.

747
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,860
You know, I think
I’ll be okay.

748
00:49:28,862 --> 00:49:32,262
I just need to
sit down and rest.

749
00:49:46,607 --> 00:49:49,007
Run! Run!

750
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:07,487
We would have won if I didn't
have to run two legs of the race.

751
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:12,223
Yeah, what's her problem?
She scared of breaking a nail?

752
00:50:19,162 --> 00:50:20,229
So how do you feel?

753
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:22,797
I still feel a little dizzy.

754
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:24,833
I understand if you
want to leave, but...

755
00:50:24,835 --> 00:50:26,433
I wasn't trying to leave.

756
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:28,802
I will be here
until next saturday,

757
00:50:28,804 --> 00:50:30,770
'Cause we agreed
that you would sign that deed.

758
00:50:30,772 --> 00:50:33,138
And I’ll be here to
personally hand it to you.

759
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,007
It sure looked like you
were trying to leave today.

760
00:50:35,009 --> 00:50:38,309
I wasn't trying to leave.
I was making a call.

761
00:50:38,311 --> 00:50:41,811
A job is at stake and I
needed to let Mr. Whitaker know

762
00:50:41,813 --> 00:50:43,212
It's taking a lot longer
than I thought.

763
00:50:43,214 --> 00:50:47,982
Meghan, the point is
to leave that behind.

764
00:50:47,984 --> 00:50:50,150
You being here
is about resting

765
00:50:50,152 --> 00:50:51,952
And getting in touch
with god.

766
00:50:51,954 --> 00:50:54,253
Calling Whitaker
is not gonna change that

767
00:50:54,255 --> 00:50:55,721
Or speed up the process.

768
00:50:55,723 --> 00:50:58,256
You are just so in control.

769
00:50:58,258 --> 00:50:59,624
But you know what I’ve
figured out?

770
00:50:59,626 --> 00:51:04,561
You're the only one who knows
how bad things are around here.

771
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:09,999
And you're the only one who knows
that this may be the last week

772
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,000
This place is in business.

773
00:51:13,002 --> 00:51:17,436
I wonder how your family
would feel if they found out.

774
00:51:19,706 --> 00:51:22,073
You threatening me?

775
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:34,749
<i>you've reached Meghan
Doherty. please leave a message.</i>

776
00:51:35,851 --> 00:51:36,817
Meghan, hey, it's me.

777
00:51:36,819 --> 00:51:38,785
I've been calling
for three days now.

778
00:51:38,787 --> 00:51:41,186
No one at god's country
is answering the phone.

779
00:51:41,188 --> 00:51:46,524
So, if you had closed the deal you
would haves called by now, right?

780
00:51:46,526 --> 00:51:50,093
I'm really getting worried.

781
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:53,195
<i>Hola, Meghan,
soy yo.</i>

782
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:54,697
It's Valentina.

783
00:51:54,699 --> 00:51:57,398
I wish you would just
pick up the phone.

784
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,001
We are all trying
to locate you.

785
00:52:01,003 --> 00:52:03,135
I really hope that

786
00:52:03,137 --> 00:52:08,672
Your not calling has anything to do
with our discussion the other night.

787
00:52:08,674 --> 00:52:11,141
I'm so sorry.

788
00:52:11,143 --> 00:52:14,644
I miss you.

789
00:52:14,646 --> 00:52:18,280
Please, just,
just call me back or,

790
00:52:18,282 --> 00:52:20,681
Or call Adam, okay?

791
00:52:20,683 --> 00:52:22,716
All right.

792
00:52:22,718 --> 00:52:24,751
Bye.

793
00:52:33,257 --> 00:52:37,693
d gotta love it in god's
country... d

794
00:52:51,137 --> 00:52:53,005
nice!

795
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:56,673
You know what, I was
just thinking something.

796
00:52:56,675 --> 00:53:01,043
When I was a kid growing up
in California,

797
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:03,345
One of the things
that I remember the most

798
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:06,648
Was spending the holidays
together with my family.

799
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,382
And even though we were
all packed in there...

800
00:53:08,384 --> 00:53:10,716
It was a tiny little
two-Bedroom house...

801
00:53:10,718 --> 00:53:11,817
I was the runt-

802
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:12,752
Rightfully so!

803
00:53:12,754 --> 00:53:13,653
I slept on the floor.

804
00:53:13,655 --> 00:53:16,588
I had my brother here,
I had my sister here.

805
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:19,089
Cousins everywhere.

806
00:53:19,091 --> 00:53:22,025
I never felt crowded.

807
00:53:22,027 --> 00:53:23,893
Never.

808
00:53:23,895 --> 00:53:29,092
You know what I felt?
I felt love. I felt togetherness.

809
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:31,731
I just don't think there's anything
that can replace that feeling,

810
00:53:31,733 --> 00:53:36,770
That feeling of being
together with your family.

811
00:53:37,871 --> 00:53:39,403
- Amen.
- Amen.

812
00:53:39,439 --> 00:53:42,139
I think maybe we should
take a little moment here

813
00:53:42,141 --> 00:53:44,573
To realize how lucky we are

814
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:49,177
To be here with each other.

815
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:53,013
amen.

816
00:53:54,449 --> 00:53:55,915
All right.

817
00:54:02,521 --> 00:54:06,790
I'm sorry if I got you
into any trouble this morning.

818
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:11,794
No, you didn't get me
into any trouble.

819
00:54:11,796 --> 00:54:14,062
I do have a question
for you.

820
00:54:14,064 --> 00:54:18,098
What's going on? Why is my
father hovering over you like

821
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,332
Mother over a new born baby?

822
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:28,472
When I came here I told
him that I needed help.

823
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:32,574
And so he agreed to help me
and treat me like everyone else.

824
00:54:32,576 --> 00:54:36,911
I'm not being nosy,
but help you with what?

825
00:54:37,212 --> 00:54:41,081
Don't worry. I'm not
a drug addict or anything.

826
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:43,415
I'm a workaholic.

827
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:47,485
And so it's work that
I think about all the time

828
00:54:47,487 --> 00:54:50,487
And hence I’m
up here for rest.

829
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:53,823
Hence, no cell phones,
no computers,

830
00:54:53,825 --> 00:54:54,990
None of that stuff.

831
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:56,925
That's what your dad's
been helping me with.

832
00:54:56,927 --> 00:55:01,762
Yeah, well, he can be bullheaded
and stubborn sometimes.

833
00:55:01,863 --> 00:55:04,630
Tell me about it.

834
00:55:06,899 --> 00:55:09,067
How's your back?

835
00:55:11,136 --> 00:55:13,137
You know, it's...

836
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:15,138
It's still a little tight

837
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,908
But I think the aspirin
has helped ease the pain.

838
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,579
so what do you...

839
00:55:27,482 --> 00:55:28,447
So tell me about Jake.

840
00:55:28,449 --> 00:55:32,517
I've been a counselor here since
my parents own and run the place.

841
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:36,019
I left for a couple of years to
go to college and business school

842
00:55:36,021 --> 00:55:39,422
And then I came back to help
my mother and father run it.

843
00:55:39,424 --> 00:55:42,257
Where did you go
to business school?

844
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:44,859
Harvard.

845
00:55:45,227 --> 00:55:48,962
You went to Harvard
business school?

846
00:55:48,964 --> 00:55:50,230
Yeah.

847
00:55:50,232 --> 00:55:51,663
What are you doing here

848
00:55:51,665 --> 00:55:52,464
Working as a counselor?

849
00:55:52,466 --> 00:55:58,035
Who needs wall street? I came here to
learn how to build the perfect bonfire.

850
00:55:58,037 --> 00:56:02,738
Plus I make
one heck of a smore.

851
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:11,478
Listen, do you
want to come with me?

852
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,280
There's something
I want to show you.

853
00:56:15,715 --> 00:56:17,849
Okay.

854
00:56:18,384 --> 00:56:21,719
So, this is my vision.

855
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:24,053
I want to build a Christian
college with full student housing.

856
00:56:24,055 --> 00:56:29,423
The campus will be a state of the art
college with full academic curriculum.

857
00:56:29,425 --> 00:56:30,725
And the students, they
can earn college credit

858
00:56:30,727 --> 00:56:33,326
And they can earn scholarships by
working at the camp during the summer.

859
00:56:33,328 --> 00:56:38,433
This is a day care center for single
mothers that want to attend the college.

860
00:56:40,634 --> 00:56:43,567
This is student housing,
and look at this.

861
00:56:43,569 --> 00:56:47,203
That's the student activity
center.

862
00:56:47,205 --> 00:56:50,672
I'm impressed. Does your
father know about this?

863
00:56:50,674 --> 00:56:52,240
Yeah, of course he does.
We spent thousands

864
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,676
Putting together a business plan
with some really solid projections.

865
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:57,944
And we can get state funding,
tax relief.

866
00:56:57,946 --> 00:57:01,113
I'm talking about building
an entire infrastructure here,

867
00:57:01,115 --> 00:57:06,051
I mean electricity, sewage, water, paving
a road that goes all the way to the highway.

868
00:57:07,152 --> 00:57:10,052
I'm sorry. Am I boring you with this?
- No! No.

869
00:57:10,054 --> 00:57:13,122
So why haven't you
put this plan into action?

870
00:57:13,124 --> 00:57:16,157
Graham estates is
a nonprofit organization.

871
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:18,392
It raises most of our money
through church offerings.

872
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:21,828
With the economy hitting
all churches, big and small,

873
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:24,362
It's put our entire
organization into flux.

874
00:57:24,364 --> 00:57:26,898
What we need is a venture
capitalist to invest,

875
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,900
But so far efforts
have fallen on deaf ears.

876
00:57:29,902 --> 00:57:35,003
Our vision is not their
vision. My family...

877
00:57:35,005 --> 00:57:39,273
We really believe in helping
those who need help.

878
00:57:39,275 --> 00:57:41,908
It's god's way.

879
00:57:46,279 --> 00:57:48,179
paperwork looks good.

880
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:50,415
we are ready to move forward
with Whitaker and associates.

881
00:57:50,417 --> 00:57:54,318
Mr. Whitaker, one question...
where's Ms. Doherty?

882
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,218
Have you heard anything?

883
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:56,085
Nothing. Adam, I’m worried.

884
00:57:56,087 --> 00:57:59,621
My brother thinks she's very impressive.

885
00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:01,223
It's been four days!

886
00:58:01,225 --> 00:58:02,289
Okay, hold on.

887
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:04,158
Yes.
Ms. Doherty?

888
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,125
Valentina hasn't
heard anything.

889
00:58:06,127 --> 00:58:08,427
...and she is. She is
very impressive indeed,

890
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:12,730
- And right now she's away.
She's handling... - Uh...

891
00:58:12,732 --> 00:58:14,398
...some very detailed
business...

892
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,132
I don't know what to do
or how to reach her.

893
00:58:16,134 --> 00:58:19,835
Why doesn't someone just drive down
there and make sure she's all right?

894
00:58:19,837 --> 00:58:24,372
- Uh... - ... I can assure you that
everything is going to plan,

895
00:58:24,374 --> 00:58:28,809
And the closing will
take place on time.

896
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:30,209
How's the weather
over there, Hoshi?

897
00:58:30,211 --> 00:58:34,379
Mr. Whitaker doesn't want
to go down and interfere.

898
00:58:34,381 --> 00:58:36,380
He'd prefer for Meghan
to call in.

899
00:58:36,382 --> 00:58:38,616
She's working on some
really big deal for the firm.

900
00:58:38,618 --> 00:58:42,718
I don't know much about it, though,
other than it's worth a lot of money.

901
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,287
Forget Whitaker and how much
money this deal is worth.

902
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:48,089
What if she's in trouble?
What if she needs our help?

903
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,023
- Uh...
- anything could have happened to her.

904
00:58:50,025 --> 00:58:53,626
You get on that phone
and call the state police

905
00:58:53,628 --> 00:58:56,227
And place a missing persons
report.

906
00:58:56,229 --> 00:58:59,364
Don't just sit around and
do nothing. You hear me?

907
00:58:59,366 --> 00:59:03,432
Okay, well, look, Mr. Whitaker says if she
doesn't call in the next couple of days,

908
00:59:03,434 --> 00:59:08,937
He'll go down there himself. All
right? I gotta go, though. Okay, bye.

909
00:59:08,939 --> 00:59:11,872
You can't keep putting this
off. What are you going to do?

910
00:59:11,874 --> 00:59:16,976
I don't know. We've tried her
cell many times. There's no answer.

911
00:59:18,078 --> 00:59:19,578
Adam, our friend is missing.

912
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,446
If you're not going
to call 911, I will.

913
00:59:22,448 --> 00:59:23,947
You decide.

914
00:59:23,949 --> 00:59:26,249
If I call 911 and she's okay,

915
00:59:26,251 --> 00:59:29,985
I risk blowing her deal
and my job.

916
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:46,296
- How's your back?
- My back's doing good.

917
00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:49,098
Hey, Meghan, I could
use your help on this pull.

918
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,233
No!

919
00:59:50,235 --> 00:59:51,133
Come on!

920
00:59:51,135 --> 00:59:52,834
You can do it.

921
00:59:54,438 --> 00:59:55,603
Meghan!

922
00:59:55,605 --> 00:59:57,772
Meghan! Meghan!

923
00:59:57,774 --> 01:00:00,473
Oh, wait a second.
Let me put my hair up.

924
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:01,807
Bring it on, blondie!

925
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:03,075
You're goin' down!

926
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:05,443
You're goin' down.
You got nothing.

927
01:00:05,445 --> 01:00:07,912
grab your ropes,
everybody!

928
01:00:07,914 --> 01:00:10,647
on your marks,

929
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:12,982
Get set,

930
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,216
Pull!

931
01:00:15,485 --> 01:00:17,786
bring it on!

932
01:00:18,087 --> 01:00:21,622
Okay, come on, come on!
One, two three!

933
01:00:21,624 --> 01:00:23,022
Come on, guys!
Pull!

934
01:00:23,024 --> 01:00:24,590
One, two three! Pull!

935
01:00:24,592 --> 01:00:25,557
Pull harder!

936
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:27,526
Come on guys!
Here we go!

937
01:00:27,528 --> 01:00:30,628
One, two three! Pull!

938
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,201
You did
a great job!

939
01:00:43,871 --> 01:00:47,807
Meghan, he has never lost!
That is amazing!

940
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:52,910
Victory, baby!
Victory!

941
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,881
Great job.

942
01:00:59,983 --> 01:01:01,850
So this is it.

943
01:01:01,852 --> 01:01:03,985
This is what it's all about.

944
01:01:03,987 --> 01:01:06,253
Wow.

945
01:01:06,255 --> 01:01:09,456
this is your reward
for winning at tug-Of-War.

946
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:11,557
you didn't
let me win, did you?

947
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:16,595
trust me when I tell you this. I love
to win too much to allow you to win.

948
01:01:31,805 --> 01:01:35,040
Okay, I... I have to go.
stay on task...

949
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:37,808
- wait.
- ... it's not personal. It's business...

950
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,443
did I do something wrong?

951
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:42,912
Can you take me back
to camp?

952
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:49,383
Meghan, so, I spoke to a guy,
out at god's country,

953
01:01:49,386 --> 01:01:53,120
And he said that a Meghan
Doubtfire with a Ferrari

954
01:01:53,122 --> 01:01:56,188
Has been out there
for the past five days.

955
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:59,124
So what's goin' on?

956
01:01:59,126 --> 01:02:01,126
What have they done to you?

957
01:02:01,128 --> 01:02:03,427
Look, I don't care
about the Yakamoto deal.

958
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:07,563
But if I don't hear from you
by the end of the auction,

959
01:02:07,565 --> 01:02:08,463
I'm calling the police.

960
01:02:08,465 --> 01:02:10,165
So what do you do
for a living?

961
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:15,902
- I'm in real estate.
- Oh, real estate. That sounds interesting.

962
01:02:15,904 --> 01:02:16,736
I want to major
in civil law.

963
01:02:16,738 --> 01:02:20,506
My father's a lawyer, so I get to see
how he helps people out of tight spots.

964
01:02:20,508 --> 01:02:24,909
I can never see you as a
person who would major in law.

965
01:02:24,911 --> 01:02:30,380
Why, 'cause I’m not
all glamorous like you?

966
01:02:31,482 --> 01:02:33,748
I always wanted to fit in
with the girls, you know.

967
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,283
It's just, I have
four brothers.

968
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:38,719
It's just easier
to play rough, you now?

969
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:43,588
I have an idea. Listen, why
don't you come to los Angeles

970
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:45,923
For a weekend with me?
Really?

971
01:02:45,925 --> 01:02:50,794
Yeah, we can,
we can go shopping,

972
01:02:50,796 --> 01:02:52,162
And...

973
01:02:52,164 --> 01:02:58,067
We could find you a new
hair style.

974
01:03:02,003 --> 01:03:05,004
How does that sound?
We could have some girl time?

975
01:03:05,006 --> 01:03:07,205
You know, just do
a bunch of girl things.

976
01:03:07,207 --> 01:03:09,040
I would like that.

977
01:03:09,042 --> 01:03:09,773
Yeah?

978
01:03:09,775 --> 01:03:10,974
Sounds like
something my mother

979
01:03:10,976 --> 01:03:12,576
And I would
have done together.

980
01:03:12,578 --> 01:03:13,943
Oh. Where's your mother?

981
01:03:13,945 --> 01:03:16,711
She died last year.

982
01:03:17,747 --> 01:03:19,781
I'm sorry.

983
01:03:19,783 --> 01:03:24,484
My father died when
I was about your age.

984
01:03:24,486 --> 01:03:27,119
I did everything
with him, and then

985
01:03:27,121 --> 01:03:29,521
When he died I just lost
interest in everything.

986
01:03:29,523 --> 01:03:35,492
Hey, you know what? You seem
too nice to be a lawyer.

987
01:03:35,494 --> 01:03:37,760
All the lawyers I know
are just ruthless.

988
01:03:37,762 --> 01:03:40,496
There's good and bad in
everything and everyone.

989
01:03:40,498 --> 01:03:42,230
I want to be a lawyer
so I can...

990
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:47,000
So I can fight for the people that
can't afford to fight for themselves.

991
01:03:47,002 --> 01:03:48,067
You know, for example,

992
01:03:48,069 --> 01:03:50,936
Say there's this big bank that locks
an elderly couple into a bad mortgage,

993
01:03:50,938 --> 01:03:56,474
And then tries to evict them from their
home for the money 'cause they're greedy.

994
01:03:56,476 --> 01:03:58,675
That's when I would swoop in...
Superlawyer extraordinaire,

995
01:03:58,677 --> 01:04:03,512
Coming in, saving the day,
saving the elderly couple,

996
01:04:03,514 --> 01:04:05,813
Punishes the bank,
does the right thing,

997
01:04:05,815 --> 01:04:08,748
I don't know, I think
it'd be great.

998
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:30,264
I know this verse on
greed. Isaiah 56:11.

999
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:36,101
"Yeah, they are greedy dogs
who can never have enough.

1000
01:04:36,103 --> 01:04:39,971
They are shepherds
that can not understand. "

1001
01:05:39,014 --> 01:05:43,082
Where are you, Meghan?

1002
01:05:43,417 --> 01:05:47,552
This is what
I was talking about, Jake.

1003
01:05:48,353 --> 01:05:50,820
Luke 10:23.

1004
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,522
"blessed are the eyes
that see what you see. "

1005
01:05:52,524 --> 01:05:56,358
- How are you doing this morning?
- Great. Good to see you.

1006
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,459
yeah?
hey, Jake.

1007
01:05:58,461 --> 01:05:59,394
The truck. Where is it?

1008
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:00,428
right in front of the office.

1009
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:02,262
yup.
keys inside?

1010
01:06:02,264 --> 01:06:04,231
Thanks, man.

1011
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:08,667
come in, Meghan.

1012
01:06:08,768 --> 01:06:12,536
- Eden?
- Hi, Meghan. Have a seat.

1013
01:06:12,538 --> 01:06:15,004
I have a confession to make.

1014
01:06:15,006 --> 01:06:19,808
Mr. Whitaker didn't send me
down here just to make an offer.

1015
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:22,510
There's a pair of businessmen,
the Yakamoto brothers,

1016
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:24,245
And they're here
to develop the land.

1017
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:27,147
They want to turn it
into a casino and resort.

1018
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,982
It's a $100 million deal
and I don't see any way

1019
01:06:29,984 --> 01:06:31,183
That you could stop it
from happening,

1020
01:06:31,185 --> 01:06:36,019
Especially since tomorrow
is the auction.

1021
01:06:36,021 --> 01:06:39,288
Thanks for
the information, Meghan.

1022
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:42,591
There's nothing left
for me to do but pray.

1023
01:06:42,593 --> 01:06:44,759
Will you stop it?

1024
01:06:44,761 --> 01:06:46,794
Right now is the decision!

1025
01:06:46,796 --> 01:06:48,128
Mr.
Whitaker is gonna come down

1026
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,529
The road any
second now and just

1027
01:06:49,531 --> 01:06:52,031
Shut down
the entire operation,

1028
01:06:52,033 --> 01:06:54,666
Including me.

1029
01:06:55,768 --> 01:06:57,201
I get it. I understand.

1030
01:06:57,203 --> 01:07:01,271
There is something really
special about this land.

1031
01:07:01,273 --> 01:07:03,572
But you have to be proactive.

1032
01:07:03,574 --> 01:07:08,710
Jake shared with me the entire vision
you have to build a Christian college.

1033
01:07:08,712 --> 01:07:10,677
You've got to find someone
to invest in it,

1034
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:14,413
To pay up the debt, to buy this
land so you can put this camp

1035
01:07:14,415 --> 01:07:17,849
I've tried everything. I've
called everyone I know with money

1036
01:07:17,851 --> 01:07:20,985
That could maybe bail me out,
but so far, no one.

1037
01:07:20,987 --> 01:07:25,088
All I have left is
my faith in god.

1038
01:07:25,556 --> 01:07:28,257
Don't you understand?
That's all I have left.

1039
01:07:28,259 --> 01:07:32,226
But what about Jake
and everyone else?

1040
01:07:33,328 --> 01:07:34,027
Jake trusts you.

1041
01:07:34,029 --> 01:07:39,499
He trusts that you and him
are gonna complete this vision.

1042
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:49,039
You're right. You're right. You're
right about the whole situation.

1043
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,608
Yeah. You know what? I'm
gonna tell my family tonight.

1044
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:57,677
It's not fair to hide things
from the ones you love.

1045
01:07:57,679 --> 01:07:59,479
It's just not fair.

1046
01:07:59,481 --> 01:08:00,613
They have the right to know.

1047
01:08:00,615 --> 01:08:01,913
Okay.
You're right.

1048
01:08:01,915 --> 01:08:05,082
No. I want you
to come with me.

1049
01:08:10,388 --> 01:08:13,722
Can I have your
attention, everyone?

1050
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:23,763
In john chapter 8,
the passage states,

1051
01:08:23,765 --> 01:08:28,666
"Then you will know the truth,
and the truth will set you free. "

1052
01:08:28,668 --> 01:08:34,037
Well, I have a confession to
make about god's country.

1053
01:08:34,039 --> 01:08:35,203
We're in foreclosure.

1054
01:08:35,205 --> 01:08:37,439
and as of saturday
we will be no more.

1055
01:08:37,441 --> 01:08:43,244
the land will got to auction
to the highest bidder.

1056
01:08:44,346 --> 01:08:45,644
But the good news is,

1057
01:08:45,646 --> 01:08:47,179
They made us an offer,
and with the money,

1058
01:08:47,181 --> 01:08:49,213
we'll be able to
start over in a new city.

1059
01:08:49,215 --> 01:08:53,550
Sure we can start over in a
different city, but I love this land.

1060
01:08:53,552 --> 01:08:58,954
Wait. Why can't just call the bank and
ask them to work something out with us?

1061
01:08:58,956 --> 01:09:00,989
Because I am the bank.

1062
01:09:02,391 --> 01:09:06,426
And my boss won't
bail you out of debt.

1063
01:09:06,428 --> 01:09:11,831
There are some businessmen and they have
made a very large offer for the land... Jake!

1064
01:09:13,965 --> 01:09:14,965
You lied to me.

1065
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:15,700
I didn't lie to you.

1066
01:09:15,702 --> 01:09:19,035
- I just didn't know how to tell you.
- Lying and not telling

1067
01:09:19,037 --> 01:09:22,171
Are the same thing to me.

1068
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:37,781
Jake, wait.

1069
01:09:40,851 --> 01:09:42,285
It's not her fault.

1070
01:09:42,287 --> 01:09:43,752
Yeah? And whose fault is it?

1071
01:09:43,754 --> 01:09:45,320
You hid this from me!
What about the college?

1072
01:09:45,322 --> 01:09:47,755
what about the vision
that we had?

1073
01:09:47,757 --> 01:09:49,456
- Son, I know...
- Know what?

1074
01:09:49,492 --> 01:09:52,625
That we're losing everything that we've
worked for and you didn't have enough respect

1075
01:09:52,627 --> 01:09:55,794
For me or the workers
to tell us?

1076
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:16,476
Meghan, how could you
do this to us?

1077
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,777
Geri, it's not her fault.

1078
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:20,712
she was just doing her job.

1079
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,446
Eden, how did
all this happen?

1080
01:10:22,448 --> 01:10:27,117
I tried everything
I could to stop this.

1081
01:10:28,485 --> 01:10:31,420
But uh, our time is short.

1082
01:10:31,422 --> 01:10:34,322
I meet with Ms. Doherty
tomorrow

1083
01:10:34,324 --> 01:10:36,556
To finalize
the paperwork.

1084
01:10:36,558 --> 01:10:39,358
So, um,

1085
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,460
Let's enjoy the rest
of the camp.

1086
01:10:41,462 --> 01:10:44,195
Pastor, could you lead us
in prayer?

1087
01:10:44,197 --> 01:10:46,029
Sure.

1088
01:10:49,733 --> 01:10:51,134
Dear heavenly father,

1089
01:10:51,136 --> 01:10:53,301
We ask for your guidance
and your wisdom,

1090
01:10:53,303 --> 01:10:58,439
And that you may pour
your blessing upon your work,

1091
01:10:58,441 --> 01:11:04,343
Your land, and your people.

1092
01:11:08,213 --> 01:11:10,013
In Jesus’ name we pray.

1093
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,015
amen.

1094
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:14,116
Amen.

1095
01:11:18,354 --> 01:11:20,053
It's okay.

1096
01:11:20,055 --> 01:11:21,755
I'm sorry.

1097
01:11:59,349 --> 01:12:01,316
Hey.

1098
01:12:08,889 --> 01:12:10,557
You know, as long
as I can remember,

1099
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:14,026
This has been my spot to come
and get away from the world,

1100
01:12:14,028 --> 01:12:19,030
Clear my mind from
any worries, doubts,

1101
01:12:20,132 --> 01:12:22,498
Fears.

1102
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,434
I'm sorry.

1103
01:12:27,036 --> 01:12:31,637
I didn't mean to mislead
you why I was here.

1104
01:12:32,573 --> 01:12:34,707
I'm just doing my job.

1105
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:36,908
I should have known.
Right? Like,

1106
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:38,876
Who drives up here
in a Ferrari?

1107
01:12:38,878 --> 01:12:41,245
It's gotta be
a banker or a lawyer,

1108
01:12:41,247 --> 01:12:43,313
Somebody self-Oriented.

1109
01:12:43,315 --> 01:12:44,714
Yeah, that would be me.

1110
01:12:44,716 --> 01:12:49,350
I was exactly that person you
just described when I came here.

1111
01:12:49,352 --> 01:12:51,152
I was on a mission
to close on this deal

1112
01:12:51,154 --> 01:12:56,622
And get back in time to have
drinks with my friends in the city.

1113
01:12:57,057 --> 01:13:00,558
But something changed.

1114
01:13:01,527 --> 01:13:04,261
After seeing all this,

1115
01:13:04,263 --> 01:13:06,429
And you sharing your...

1116
01:13:06,431 --> 01:13:08,798
Your vision with me,

1117
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,898
And meeting everyone,
I understand why

1118
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:14,635
Your father doesn't want
to part with this land.

1119
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:19,471
This really is god's country!

1120
01:13:20,206 --> 01:13:22,674
Look, I know I can't
blame you,

1121
01:13:22,676 --> 01:13:26,309
But I don't
have to like it.

1122
01:14:05,005 --> 01:14:08,840
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1123
01:14:08,842 --> 01:14:10,841
I feel so bad.

1124
01:14:10,843 --> 01:14:15,611
Don't. I realize that you
were just doing your job.

1125
01:14:15,613 --> 01:14:21,085
And that I need to forgive
like Jesus would have.

1126
01:14:27,054 --> 01:14:29,855
Do you want
to forgive me?

1127
01:14:29,857 --> 01:14:33,524
Yes. Yes, I do.

1128
01:14:33,526 --> 01:14:34,858
I really enjoyed
what we shared together.

1129
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:40,262
And I learned that there's a
lesson in every part of life

1130
01:14:40,264 --> 01:14:42,497
And it is not your fault
that this camp is broke.

1131
01:14:42,499 --> 01:14:47,402
That's something that Jake and
Eden and Caroline have to deal with.

1132
01:14:48,504 --> 01:14:53,004
So...
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1133
01:14:53,006 --> 01:14:57,041
Want me to come
for a walk with you?

1134
01:14:57,876 --> 01:14:59,375
I'd rather be by myself.

1135
01:14:59,377 --> 01:15:03,946
I just... I have
a lot to think about.

1136
01:15:19,092 --> 01:15:21,825
you've reached Meghan Doherty.
please leave a message.

1137
01:15:21,827 --> 01:15:23,559
Meghan,
Whitaker’s furious.

1138
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,561
he plans to come out there
if you don't call in.

1139
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:31,498
your job's at stake. I hope
you're doing the right thing.

1140
01:15:34,568 --> 01:15:39,204
I should just close
the deal and walk away.

1141
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:42,373
That's all you have to do. You've
done it a million times before

1142
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:46,809
And it's gotten you a Ferrari, a
home out in the Hollywood hills,

1143
01:15:46,811 --> 01:15:48,410
I mean,
what more do you need?

1144
01:15:48,412 --> 01:15:53,381
Who cares if I’ve taken away
everything that they care about?

1145
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:55,549
Pow!

1146
01:15:56,818 --> 01:16:00,485
When have I ever
cared before?

1147
01:16:02,288 --> 01:16:03,755
Meghan, just stay on task.

1148
01:16:03,757 --> 01:16:08,926
It's not personal. It's...
It's business.

1149
01:16:11,928 --> 01:16:14,062
It's business.

1150
01:16:20,801 --> 01:16:24,336
Hey, pastor Tinsley!

1151
01:16:26,739 --> 01:16:27,505
Meghan.

1152
01:16:27,507 --> 01:16:30,140
How do you feel today?

1153
01:16:30,142 --> 01:16:32,241
Confused.

1154
01:16:32,243 --> 01:16:33,976
Okay, I’m listening.

1155
01:16:33,978 --> 01:16:37,112
Yesterday I felt so bad,
and...

1156
01:16:37,114 --> 01:16:38,545
Today is the last day,

1157
01:16:38,547 --> 01:16:42,148
And I just feel like
the executioner.

1158
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:45,617
You're a good servant. That's all
god wants us to be is good servants.

1159
01:16:45,619 --> 01:16:50,956
I guess I’ve just been experiencing
this overwhelming amount of guilt

1160
01:16:52,057 --> 01:16:52,989
These last few days.

1161
01:16:52,991 --> 01:16:56,792
If it's god's will,
then it's his will.

1162
01:16:56,794 --> 01:16:57,893
You're only his messenger.

1163
01:16:57,895 --> 01:17:00,762
I just feel like there's
something that I should do.

1164
01:17:00,764 --> 01:17:04,131
If this is god's will
then it's his will.

1165
01:17:09,635 --> 01:17:12,070
Good luck.

1166
01:17:14,539 --> 01:17:16,239
Everybody ready?

1167
01:17:43,126 --> 01:17:47,561
Hey! Jake! Jake! Jake!

1168
01:17:47,563 --> 01:17:51,130
Jake, listen. Grab
your truck and come with me.

1169
01:17:51,132 --> 01:17:55,297
- What's going on? - I don't have
time to explain. Just follow me.

1170
01:17:55,468 --> 01:17:57,902
Listen, Jake, I know you don;
t trust me, but I have an idea.

1171
01:17:57,904 --> 01:17:59,904
I've had enough of your ideas,
okay? Why should I trust you?

1172
01:17:59,906 --> 01:18:03,740
You standing here mad at me
is not going to save this land.

1173
01:18:03,742 --> 01:18:07,742
Let's go to your room.
Get your business plan.

1174
01:18:07,744 --> 01:18:09,911
I have an idea.

1175
01:18:09,913 --> 01:18:14,480
If you don't trust me,
then trust god.

1176
01:18:16,516 --> 01:18:17,615
Come on.

1177
01:18:17,617 --> 01:18:20,918
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1178
01:18:40,468 --> 01:18:43,935
Meghan, oh my god! Where are
you? We've been worried sick!

1179
01:18:43,937 --> 01:18:47,170
Adam, I’m fine.
tell Whitaker nothing, okay?

1180
01:18:47,172 --> 01:18:48,004
I can't just do that.

1181
01:18:48,006 --> 01:18:51,040
Look, you fell off the face of
the earth. We all have questions.

1182
01:18:51,042 --> 01:18:54,309
call Jason and tell him that
I am on my way bearing gifts.

1183
01:18:54,311 --> 01:18:56,276
okay, my friend?

1184
01:18:56,278 --> 01:18:58,711
Yeah, okay.

1185
01:19:01,248 --> 01:19:02,781
My car.
Take it. It's yours.

1186
01:19:02,783 --> 01:19:07,451
Jason, you told me if I had a
great opportunity, you wanted in.

1187
01:19:07,453 --> 01:19:09,786
What is it?
This is it.

1188
01:19:09,788 --> 01:19:11,721
It's the future.

1189
01:19:11,723 --> 01:19:14,857
I hope you have
your check book.

1190
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:23,629
Hello.

1191
01:19:23,631 --> 01:19:25,564
Mr. Whitaker,
we can no longer wait.

1192
01:19:25,566 --> 01:19:28,900
I thought you said the deal
would be closed by today.

1193
01:19:28,902 --> 01:19:30,300
Hoshi, relax.

1194
01:19:30,302 --> 01:19:33,636
I gave you my word. You
know how these lawyers work,

1195
01:19:33,638 --> 01:19:36,338
Going over all that paperwork.
It takes some time.

1196
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,874
I understand that,
Mr. Whitaker.

1197
01:19:38,876 --> 01:19:40,541
but we had a deal.

1198
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,910
and we agreed upon a deadline.

1199
01:19:42,912 --> 01:19:44,177
Yeah, but...

1200
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:46,079
I’ll wait for your call.

1201
01:19:57,388 --> 01:19:58,988
All right, gather around,
folks.

1202
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:00,789
we're gonna start the auction
in about five minutes.

1203
01:20:00,791 --> 01:20:06,727
now, what you're gonna be bidding
on is 1,000 acres of god's country.

1204
01:20:06,729 --> 01:20:12,330
Please, serious bidders only.
Includes three nice trailers,

1205
01:20:12,332 --> 01:20:15,933
Lovely little log cabin,
and a private lake.

1206
01:20:15,935 --> 01:20:21,904
All right, we'll start
the bidding at 75,000.

1207
01:20:24,874 --> 01:20:25,807
Wait!

1208
01:20:25,809 --> 01:20:27,841
- 1,000 acres of...
- No no no! Wait wait wait!

1209
01:20:27,843 --> 01:20:31,410
I got it. I got the payment.
Here you go.

1210
01:20:31,412 --> 01:20:36,114
I'm with Whitaker and associates
and I hereby present to you

1211
01:20:36,116 --> 01:20:39,917
To restore the land
into good standing.

1212
01:20:40,785 --> 01:20:42,118
Everything seems
to be in order.

1213
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:46,955
Sorry, folks,
no auction today.

1214
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:52,625
Thanks.

1215
01:20:54,762 --> 01:21:00,233
Meghan, I hope that smile is
because Whitaker and associates

1216
01:21:06,002 --> 01:21:07,770
No.

1217
01:21:08,038 --> 01:21:10,104
We have a new partner.

1218
01:21:10,406 --> 01:21:11,606
God's country's gonna survive,

1219
01:21:11,608 --> 01:21:14,641
So we can continue to
save lives and give back.

1220
01:21:14,643 --> 01:21:18,144
Do you think the world needs
another casino to take people's

1221
01:21:18,146 --> 01:21:21,279
Why couldn't you build something
that gives back to mankind?

1222
01:21:21,281 --> 01:21:24,582
Meghan, you gotta
be kidding me.

1223
01:21:24,584 --> 01:21:26,082
No, I’m not, sir.

1224
01:21:26,084 --> 01:21:30,052
after spending time here and seeing
what this land was really about,

1225
01:21:30,054 --> 01:21:34,522
I realized I could not be a part
of building a casino out here.

1226
01:21:34,524 --> 01:21:36,823
There are so many other pieces
of land in this vast desert

1227
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:40,159
Where the Yakamoto brothers
can build their casino on.

1228
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:44,429
This little piece of
land, this is too valuable,

1229
01:21:44,431 --> 01:21:47,397
To this camp,
to these people,

1230
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:51,200
And now me.

1231
01:21:54,237 --> 01:21:58,539
You know what?
You're fired.

1232
01:21:58,541 --> 01:22:00,506
I know.

1233
01:22:00,508 --> 01:22:02,108
Meghan, I trusted you

1234
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:06,378
To come up here
and do the right thing!

1235
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,112
And you crossed me?

1236
01:22:08,114 --> 01:22:09,180
I did do the right thing,

1237
01:22:09,182 --> 01:22:14,216
And it took being up here at god's country
and this land to finally realize that.

1238
01:22:14,218 --> 01:22:20,188
Now if you'll excuse me,
we have a college to build.

1239
01:22:40,803 --> 01:22:45,171
Man, I can not believe you
got rid of that sweet ride.

1240
01:22:45,173 --> 01:22:47,741
Listen, I’m gonna be in los
Angeles in a couple of weeks.

1241
01:22:47,743 --> 01:22:51,809
Maybe I can come down
there and we can hang out.

1242
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:53,278
Promise.

1243
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,112
Yes.

1244
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:00,716
Oh, stop it.

1245
01:23:00,718 --> 01:23:02,851
I'm gonna go get the truck.

1246
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,452
All right.

1247
01:23:04,454 --> 01:23:07,021
I'm really gonna miss you.

1248
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:09,188
I told you I want you
to come hang out with me.

1249
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:12,090
Yeah, but you're
just saying that now.

1250
01:23:12,092 --> 01:23:13,191
Promise.

1251
01:23:13,193 --> 01:23:15,626
You're special.

1252
01:23:16,495 --> 01:23:18,562
Thank you.

1253
01:23:19,597 --> 01:23:23,632
Meghan, we're truly
gonna miss you.

1254
01:23:24,401 --> 01:23:26,301
How did you know?

1255
01:23:26,303 --> 01:23:29,569
I didn't. He did.

1256
01:23:36,242 --> 01:23:37,575
You ready to go?

1257
01:23:37,577 --> 01:23:40,244
I am.

1258
01:23:46,716 --> 01:23:51,619
So, partner, you ready to take me back
to the hustle and bustle of city life?

1259
01:23:51,621 --> 01:23:53,420
You know you're always
welcome to stay here.

1260
01:23:53,422 --> 01:23:55,088
You can teach business
finance at the college.

1261
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:59,358
Trust me. I'll be back
to check on my new venture.

1262
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,793
Especially since
I’m officially unemployed.

1263
01:24:01,795 --> 01:24:06,930
Yeah, well, I hope business isn't
the only reason you come back.

1264
01:24:08,032 --> 01:24:12,701
- How about I buy you dinner?
- You know, I know a great sushi place.

1265
01:24:12,703 --> 01:24:16,270
hey, do you have
any plans tomorrow?

1266
01:24:16,272 --> 01:24:19,172
Why? What do you
have in mind?

1267
01:24:28,747 --> 01:24:32,314
Hello? Meghan!

1268
01:24:35,718 --> 01:24:36,451
Oh.

1269
01:24:36,453 --> 01:24:40,654
Well, I can't say
I’m not disappointed.

1270
01:24:41,154 --> 01:24:43,422
Well, I know that you're busy.

1271
01:24:44,258 --> 01:24:49,394
Meghan, can you wait a second?
There's someone at the door.

1272
01:24:50,496 --> 01:24:52,362
Be right back.

1273
01:24:58,201 --> 01:25:00,234
Oh!

1274
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:02,135
Yes?

1275
01:25:02,137 --> 01:25:05,371
Hi. I have a delivery
for a Ms. Emma Doherty.

1276
01:25:05,373 --> 01:25:06,271
That's me.

1277
01:25:06,273 --> 01:25:07,740
Great. These are for you.

1278
01:25:07,742 --> 01:25:08,940
Oh, thank you.

1279
01:25:08,942 --> 01:25:10,375
Have a great day.

1280
01:25:10,377 --> 01:25:11,975
Bye.
You too.

1281
01:25:15,013 --> 01:25:17,646
Oh, Meghan.

1282
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:21,883
Okay, I’m back.

1283
01:25:21,885 --> 01:25:25,552
I just received the flowers.
How beautiful! Thank you.

1284
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:28,421
At least you didn't
forget about me.

1285
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:32,523
Again? Please hold.

1286
01:25:37,828 --> 01:25:38,928
Oh!

1287
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:40,029
Surprise!

1288
01:25:40,031 --> 01:25:44,098
Oh, my god! Meghan!

1289
01:25:44,366 --> 01:25:46,134
Oh, sweetheart!

1290
01:25:46,136 --> 01:25:48,468
Happy birthday, mom.

1291
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:52,104
Oh! Thank you.
Come in.

1292
01:25:52,106 --> 01:25:52,905
Oh my god!

1293
01:25:52,907 --> 01:25:57,007
- Happy birthday! You look beautiful.
- Thank you!

1294
01:25:57,009 --> 01:25:58,876
This is Jake.

1295
01:25:58,878 --> 01:26:00,810
Hi, I’m Jake.

1296
01:26:00,812 --> 01:26:02,011
Hi!

1297
01:26:02,013 --> 01:26:03,445
Yeah, I know!

1298
01:26:03,447 --> 01:26:04,179
Come in!

1299
01:26:04,181 --> 01:26:09,251
Oh, sweetheart,
I can't believe you did this!

1300
01:26:10,352 --> 01:26:11,818
Hey, come on!

1301
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:16,055
I was so surprised!
I just couldn't believe it.

1302
01:26:16,057 --> 01:26:17,321
I actually got you
a little something.

1303
01:26:17,323 --> 01:26:19,557
Jake, thank you.
That's very sweet of you.

1304
01:26:19,559 --> 01:26:23,026
You're very welcome. Your
daughter's very important to me

1305
01:26:23,028 --> 01:26:25,428
In the little time
I’ve known her.

1306
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,495
That's so sweet. Thank you.

1307
01:26:32,068 --> 01:26:35,034
Yay! Cake!

1308
01:26:36,403 --> 01:26:39,237
Oh, look at that!

1309
01:26:39,972 --> 01:26:43,507
Happy birthday, mom.

1310
01:26:43,509 --> 01:26:45,041
You think it's big enough?

1311
01:26:46,378 --> 01:26:49,344
I'm so glad you're here.

1312
01:26:49,346 --> 01:26:51,246
Oh!

1313
01:26:51,248 --> 01:26:55,215
Hey, you mean
the world to me.

1314
01:26:58,119 --> 01:26:59,618
Thanks, sweetie.

1315
01:27:00,253 --> 01:27:03,288
Okay, now blow out
your candles.

1316
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:06,323
Okay. Ready?
