Are you ready to sign, Ah?
- Oh...

37
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:29,675
As you know, today I called
an emergency meeting

38
00:06:29,717 --> 00:06:31,633
a very important reason,

39
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:34,759
But first, you have something
interesting to tell?

40
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:40,467
Buckwheat!
- Yes, this morning my sister left the ring on the toilet ..

41
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:42,967
The woman are unhappy men!

00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:47,883
Froggy!
- It's a girl who moved on my street

43
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:50,801
and came to me... want to play ..

44
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:53,883
But do not worry, I solved it!

45
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:56,508
What have you done?

46
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:04,424
I removed the lizard!
Yeah! yes!

47
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,299
Good job, man-frog!

48
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,674
Record this, Oh?
- Oh!

49
00:07:09,675 --> 00:07:14,550
Well, boys, let's talk about
pride in our club: "The Blur"!

50
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:17,217
"The Blur" is never beaten,

51
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:21,467
since early times five years ago!

52
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,342
Sunday that honor and defend our trophy!

53
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:31,549
The cool is that this year's
trophy will be awarded

54
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:39,550
by none other than the
great driver AJFerguson!

55
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,675
It's the best driver in the world!

56
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:48,883
To hear a azuga! Azuga! Azuga!

57
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:51,301
Beautiful Heeei "azuga!

58
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:59,592
And now, why our emergency
meeting.Choosing driver!

59
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:05,133
Our driver must be a real man!

60
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:12,259
A man so true, that if they fall from a
building, it hit directly over a girl!

61
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,133
Gentlemen, driver's name this year is...

62
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:26,133
none other than my best
friend in the world...

63
00:08:26,134 --> 00:08:31,300
Alfalfa!
- Oh yes!

64
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:36,884
Even where the hell is Alfalfa?

65
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:18,801
Forget it guys, come on!

66
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:21,467
Silence Petey!

67
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:27,884
Oh no! It's awful!

68
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:30,342
Buckwheat, give me your rod...

69
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:36,550
Oh, Darla, we are two
hearts that beat the same!

70
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:46,218
.. two souls in a shoe...

71
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:50,299
And then how stupid that belong
to the club that hates women?

72
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,509
You know, I am a woman... somehow...

73
00:09:55,592 --> 00:10:00,134
Let me tell you something, Darla ..
I am not like those guys.

74
00:10:00,176 --> 00:10:03,175
I am a sensitive man...

75
00:10:03,176 --> 00:10:10,300
.. are in connection
with my feminine side ..

76
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:11,509
How nice!

77
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,382
It's worse than I thought!

78
00:10:13,383 --> 00:10:16,966
You know, Alfalfa, soon it will be
fair, and will be a contest of talent!

79
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:20,841
And I'm wondering if maybe
you want to sing with me ..

80
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:23,675
You serious? I would be honored!

81
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:28,008
I got an idea! Why not
go to a picnic tomorrow?

82
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:29,633
Pardoooon?

83
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:33,299
The way they feed my soul makes me ..

84
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,217
.. you want to feed your stomach!

85
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,050
Nice! And prove to me you're proud of me

86
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:43,301
I have to go to your club picnic!

87
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:44,967
No!

88
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:52,259
Tomorrow... tomorrow? Swimming Day!
Of course!

89
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:57,218
Oh, Alfalfa, you're a cute!

90
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,218
Right, Woim, are you ready for the test?
Yeah, Butch!

91
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:24,383
I lost the bar!

92
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:30,967
As labor in vain...

93
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:44,674
everything works perfectly!
Guys are swimming,

94
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:47,134
and I'm home, with a mass of pain.

95
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:49,425
Nothing bad can happen!

96
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:55,424
Hi, Butch!
- Shut up!

97
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:57,549
When I beat last time?

98
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,217

102
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:18,801
"I do not see anything...
- Come on, jackass!

103
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:22,425
Let's go, can not run too fast.

104
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:25,134
Come back, little tadpole bad!

And I'm Darla!

114
00:13:40,675 --> 00:13:43,217
My father bought the oil refinery.

115
00:13:43,218 --> 00:13:46,133
That explains why you're so refined!

116
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:48,258
Yes, and so oily!

117
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:50,176

00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,967
I gotta go.

123

What stallion!
- It is smoother than a baby's bottom!

124
00:14:21,842 --> 00:14:24,926
And it smells much better!

125
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,051
You're so nice that you brought me here.

126
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:05,342
A candlelit dinner! I am amazed!

127
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,967
Sorry...

128
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:27,092
I seem to have some Vantu-banturi ..

129
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:31,176
Grape juice?
- Yes, please!

00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:40,717
For us!

131
00:15:50,218 --> 00:15:53,424
It tastes like someone
poured l'had a old boot!

132
00:15:53,425 --> 00:15:55,759
In fact, from Tennessee!

133
00:15:58,717 --> 00:16:00,634
It must have been a bad year ..

134
00:16:05,218 --> 00:16:08,092
Maybe I should look in the bag!

135
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,218
What sandwich I brought you?
- That!

136
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:14,591
What would you do instead?

and what's mine is ours!

138

You know exactly what to
say to a girl your breath!

139
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:23,467
That's her breathtaking!

140

Porky certainly know how to
make a sand (sand), Vishal!

141
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:37,883
But it was not sand...
it was the cat litter.

142
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:40,383
Do not worry, it's pretty fresh!

143

It's the symbol of my
undying affection for you!

00:17:42,884 --> 00:17:50,884
Darla, do you mind if you

153
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:55,217
What?
A kiss ..

154
00:17:55,218 --> 00:17:56,675

In my haste to eat, I
forgot you are a club tour!

159
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:29,008
This is a wall, here
another, and here's closet!

160
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:32,382
You've lost your mind?
I do not want to go there?

161
00:18:32,383 --> 00:18:35,050
Just as I thought, I'm ashamed of myself!

162
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:40,841
No, I'm proud of you, just do
not want anyone to see you.

163
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:44,550
Up here! I left!

We enter the club ..

Swietzer Alfalfa, I condemn
the execution at dawn!

199
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,966
Your Honor, may I suggest that
the defendant was punished

200
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:47,967
and that the punishment will be
keeping the car racing day and night!

201
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:51,549
Court approves!

202
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,674

00:24:01,884 --> 00:24:04,717
Another term of the bail
the accused will be

206
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:09,884

207
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:18,259

Yes, you must choose.

215
00:25:02,842 --> 00:25:05,509

216
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:21,424

It's just a hole in the tent!

225
00:26:31,218 --> 00:26:33,550
I think about Darla, right?

226
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,259
And I wonder if she thinks of me!

227
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:41,717
Why are guys such assholes?

228
00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:46,549
I think of Alfalfa, right?

229
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,674
Oh no no no, no way!

230
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:52,051
You sure?

231
00:26:54,342 --> 00:26:57,758
Girls are like a bad song!
Once you enter head

What must be so... different?

234
00:27:09,467 --> 00:27:11,299

Boys Do not listen!

239
00:27:19,342 --> 00:27:21,341
All they want is to talk!

240
00:27:21,342 --> 00:27:23,674
They like to do the bosses!

241
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,467
No, not so!

00:37:50,176 --> 00:37:52,134
Oh, thank you!

354
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:58,133
That's fine .. you can keep it.

355
00:37:58,134 --> 00:38:02,259
And I'm excited ..Waldo will be here ..

356
00:38:02,301 --> 00:38:04,801
Darla's boyfriend's Waldo!

357
00:38:04,842 --> 00:38:11,009
I love you?
No .. no .. not sure ..

358
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:15,634
But it is a boy who just would
not want to know him better ..

359
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:20,801
And his name is Alfalfa? What physical!

360
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:22,134
You crazy?

361
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:26,884
And I saw a Alfalfa.He kidnapped
the best years of life.

362
00:38:26,926 --> 00:38:34,425
Same here. I like you tricked me and
then left me like a hot potato.

363
00:38:36,842 --> 00:38:41,092
Plus, you know what?
No, what?

364
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:44,675
I heard the girls clothes!

365
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:53,674
I do not miss it at all, but his voice ..!

366
00:38:53,675 --> 00:38:59,301
When singing makes me melt
like a lollipop for July 4th!

367
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:03,633
It's very romantic!

368
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:07,884
It was very nice, but we gotta go!

369
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:12,801
Guys, it's time to put
yourself in position!

370
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,092
It's time for the show!

371
00:39:20,343 --> 00:39:22,134
Spanky, what?

372
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:28,218
Now, scenes from the Nutcracker!

373
00:39:33,717 --> 00:39:35,967
Two, three...

374
00:39:39,926 --> 00:39:41,884

375
00:39:52,342 --> 00:39:55,259
Come here, hold my hand!
- Are you crazy?

376
00:40:47,592 --> 00:40:49,425
To get out of here!

377
00:40:50,592 --> 00:40:52,800
Well I finally caught that frog!

378
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:55,592
Yes, I should only worry about the warts!

379
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:05,634
You've destroyed the recital! Where e...?

380
00:41:05,717 --> 00:41:07,884
Get out of there, lady!

381
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:10,134
I would not do this for you!

382
00:41:12,926 --> 00:41:17,884
This is a professional ballet school!
Come out and will not return!

383
00:41:28,467 --> 00:41:33,343
"I'll distract them and you run ..
- Thanks, Spanky, you're a good friend!

384
00:41:33,344 --> 00:41:34,967
I do thank...

385
00:41:39,176 --> 00:41:43,134
Well again filled donuts! Go with me?

386
00:41:43,176 --> 00:41:48,925
We would expect Pavement .. but
two dwarves, and to CAFTA!

387
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:51,675
Your loss, baby!

388
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:59,509
You have a hamburger to
go after shake that?

389
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:06,759
It's him!

390
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:11,383
Come back, freak!

391
00:42:26,675 --> 00:42:28,092
And do not go!

392
00:42:46,675 --> 00:42:49,383
The situation may not worsen more!

393
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:56,382
And the clouds opened up and God
said: "I hate you, Alfalfa!"

394
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,801
Nice tan! Some last words?

395
00:42:59,842 --> 00:43:02,967
Yeah... see you!

396
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:26,051
I'll drive yourself towards the exit!
Thanks!

397
00:43:26,092 --> 00:43:27,425
You better!

398
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:33,717
We were locked out!

399
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:03,467
Alfalfa, this is a part of
you that I have ever seen!

400
00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:12,134
Darla, there is an
explanation for all this,

401
00:44:12,176 --> 00:44:16,009
to invent that later!

402
00:44:24,675 --> 00:44:27,134
You like pickled cucumbers?
Well, I guess!

403
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:34,134
"I love pickled cucumbers!
- My mother obliged to eat.

404
00:44:34,176 --> 00:44:36,051
I am crazy about her.

405
00:44:37,134 --> 00:44:39,301
I sell my cucumber with five money!

406
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:44,342
How about two?
- Welcome ..

407
00:44:45,801 --> 00:44:53,176
I 2 cucumbers, 2 cucumbers

408
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:02,134
Hard day?
- Do not ask me!

409
00:45:03,343 --> 00:45:05,342
Hebrew Am I ready?

410
00:45:24,759 --> 00:45:31,716
"We guys terminator
Crocodile girls throw!"

411
00:45:31,717 --> 00:45:39,717
"club fucked us, we have no money,
But I came here to do!"

412
00:45:46,717 --> 00:45:49,801
It looks good .. it will be easy!

413
00:45:51,634 --> 00:45:54,633
Spanky, me and Porky, we have an idea!

414
00:45:54,634 --> 00:45:56,801
Keep it, you may need it when you grow up!

415
00:45:56,842 --> 00:45:58,300
Well...

416
00:45:58,301 --> 00:46:00,383
"Entry - $ 3"

417
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:04,550
Hey, maybe this works! Go!

418
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:08,801
Ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls!

419
00:46:08,842 --> 00:46:13,217
Come if you dare to see
the quirks of nature!

420
00:46:13,218 --> 00:46:15,883
No science can not explain!

421
00:46:15,884 --> 00:46:23,884
Come see this mutant,
amazing and incredible!

422
00:46:24,383 --> 00:46:29,134
It's 1 meter 20 and eating chicken!

423
00:46:35,842 --> 00:46:39,051
Let people have to make some money!

424
00:46:39,092 --> 00:46:41,259
May Give us money, a lion, anything!

425
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:44,009
We must build a new house!

426
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,342
Hurry up!

427
00:46:46,383 --> 00:46:50,300
People, we need your money!

428
00:46:51,592 --> 00:46:55,176
Want to join?
- At least give people in cars!

429
00:46:56,717 --> 00:46:58,801
Please enter my mind!

430
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:08,801
I will not think Darla,
I will not think Darla!

431
00:47:10,218 --> 00:47:16,383
It Spanky is right! Maybe they
should take my mind off love!

432
00:47:19,467 --> 00:47:22,425
Oh, I do not have paper!

433
00:47:27,134 --> 00:47:30,259
No, not that kind of paper!

434
00:47:38,009 --> 00:47:40,009
Thanks Petey!

435
00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:45,008
"stuff to do: air cushion,
sendvisuri sand ..."

436
00:47:45,009 --> 00:47:51,966
Betrayed by Spanky!

437
00:47:51,967 --> 00:47:55,467
It's come as Darla hates me!

438
00:48:08,383 --> 00:48:12,092
Come and you, Petey! Wait!

439
00:48:20,134 --> 00:48:23,133
Well Spanky, so things had
not really emerged as ..

440
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:26,634
Yes, even we have less
money than when I arrived!

441
00:48:26,675 --> 00:48:29,592
Hey, I thought the show had to be free!

442
00:48:31,884 --> 00:48:34,008
Look how much money!

443
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:37,091
What happens?
I put that one ad-

444
00:48:37,092 --> 00:48:39,842
and people began to pay us.

445
00:48:39,884 --> 00:48:43,467
Buckwheat, Porky, some are geniuses!
- Thanks!

446
00:48:43,509 --> 00:48:47,009
What would you take me, and I take a break?

447
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:49,301
Well!

448
00:48:54,383 --> 00:48:58,967
McFarley Spanky!
- Ms. Crabtree!

449
00:48:59,009 --> 00:49:02,759
I would expect that from a child
of four years, but not from you!

450
00:49:04,634 --> 00:49:07,966
Spanky, it is wrong to deceive people!

451
00:49:07,967 --> 00:49:10,342
It's like when you copy the theme!

452
00:49:10,383 --> 00:49:13,466
But me ..
What do we do with all that money?

453
00:49:13,467 --> 00:49:15,966
We can not back to all these people!

454
00:49:15,967 --> 00:49:20,259
Ms. Crabtree, I have a suggestion!

455
00:49:25,176 --> 00:49:28,634
Interesting ..lntriguing ..

456
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,467
I like it!

457
00:50:47,759 --> 00:50:51,466
Ms. Crabtree, you still have
room for another number?

458
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:55,050
I think you can sneak.
- Thank you, Miss Crabtree!

459
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,801
You're welcome!

460
00:50:56,842 --> 00:51:04,842
Guys, I persuaded Miss Crabtree to
use money as a prize to the rally!

461
00:51:08,134 --> 00:51:10,509
Imagine! In three days,
the money will be ours!

462
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:16,092
It all went wrong, but not in
any way we can lose the race!

463
00:51:29,842 --> 00:51:33,259
- "The Blur" now belongs to Butch!
- And his Woim ..

464
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:38,092
Oh, it's even Falafel!
- Alfalfa!

465
00:51:38,134 --> 00:51:41,801
Anyway .. I hope you have not
lost my duet with Darla.

466
00:51:41,842 --> 00:51:46,925
You call that duo?
- It was great!

467
00:51:46,926 --> 00:51:48,759
And she did not sing bad either ..

468
00:51:50,509 --> 00:51:52,801
What do Forgive me?

469
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:59,259
I warm voice.I'm about to win
it back on Darla by song.

470
00:52:13,134 --> 00:52:16,258
You do not understand? Darla
you can not stand it!

471
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:18,092
Alfalfa, you follow!

472
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,467
I love Darla after her to sing!

473
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:28,842
Can not resist my voice, she even told me!

474
00:52:28,884 --> 00:52:30,342
Oh, dear ..

475
00:52:36,509 --> 00:52:39,592
It's a love song about a loser ..

476
00:52:39,634 --> 00:52:46,050
Long ago, I fell in love with a
girl and because the best friends

477
00:52:46,051 --> 00:52:51,800
that betrayed me, she came
to believe that hate women!

478
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:59,801
But I love them! So I dedicate this
cup to the girl I love most...

479
00:53:01,592 --> 00:53:04,300
Please do not call me names,
please do not tell me the name ..

480
00:53:04,301 --> 00:53:06,092
Darla!

481
00:53:35,884 --> 00:53:38,675
I'll break this miserable pain!

482
00:54:15,884 --> 00:54:18,550
I hate you, Alfalfa!

483
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:32,633
Hello, Mr. Balloon!

484
00:54:32,634 --> 00:54:39,050
It was the most painful act
of love that I've seen!

485
00:54:39,051 --> 00:54:46,341
Do not talk to me, traitor!
Judas! It's your fault!

486
00:54:46,342 --> 00:54:49,342
My fault?
You burn the club!

487
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:56,259
And my fault? Really, you should
guard car racing pampalaule!

488
00:54:56,301 --> 00:55:01,884
Relax, mancatorule mud, I
parked it right there!

489
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:14,009
Was here...
- So where is he?

490
00:55:14,051 --> 00:55:15,842
Boy, you just mistakes!

491
00:55:15,884 --> 00:55:21,759
So far, fearful parrot! I want to
have a club that you give out!

492
00:55:22,926 --> 00:55:28,634
You know, dirty and slippery ball?
If would be a club, I would resign!

493
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:18,218
Why do not you go reconcile
with him, Alfalfa?

494
00:56:18,259 --> 00:56:22,467
You friends when you were a year.
- He started it!

495
00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:25,759
And you should finish it. You
are a team, as Bert and Ernie,

496
00:56:25,801 --> 00:56:29,300
Superman and Clark Kent,
Millie and vanilla.

497
00:56:30,634 --> 00:56:33,508
At least go and talk to him, what cost?

498
00:56:33,509 --> 00:56:36,050
I mean apart from my dignity and pride?

499
00:56:36,051 --> 00:56:43,134
All I know is that you're not
a friend of life, a life!

500
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:10,259
Spanky's home?
- Sorry, Alfalfa, not e.

501
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,842
I'm sorry, Spanky, Alfalfa is not here.

502
00:57:12,884 --> 00:57:17,759
Naspa!
- Naspa!

503
00:57:26,383 --> 00:57:28,467
I thought that you find here!

504
00:57:30,592 --> 00:57:36,050
I'm sorry I made eating mud.And
dirty and slippery ball.

505
00:57:36,051 --> 00:57:42,258
I'm sorry I made fearful
and pampalau parrot!

506
00:57:42,259 --> 00:57:45,884
I'm sorry I said that spew crusty asshole!

507
00:57:45,926 --> 00:57:49,633
But you told me so!

508
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:53,383
A. I think just a thought ..

509
00:57:54,467 --> 00:58:00,259
Fire Sorry!
- I'm sorry I ruined your picnic with Darla!

510
00:58:00,967 --> 00:58:04,508
Maybe I am a little
responsible for the fire ..

511
00:58:04,509 --> 00:58:10,925
You know Spanky? I like girls .. and I think
it will be worse when you stop growing.

512
00:58:10,926 --> 00:58:16,176
I know you like girls, fly! The
problem is that rules are rules.

513
00:58:16,218 --> 00:58:19,176
But hatred for women is
the most important thing?

514
00:58:19,218 --> 00:58:22,634
I mean, can not be a
club we like something?

515
00:58:24,926 --> 00:58:28,341
Yes, but without a box,
we can not have a club.

516
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:32,716
Hey, you have burned a box, not the club.

517
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:35,967
A club is made up of friends who
are together in any situation.

518
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:46,717
I wish only that we can participate
in the rally.But it's impossible!

519
00:58:46,759 --> 00:58:54,759
Who said that? We can if we work together.

520
00:59:20,842 --> 00:59:22,675
Go after materials, guys!

521
00:59:50,383 --> 00:59:52,383
He, Petey!

522
00:59:58,218 --> 01:00:00,342
Screwdriver!
- Screwdriver!

523
01:00:16,218 --> 01:00:18,259
Key!

524
01:00:22,884 --> 01:00:27,801
Yo, Oh, you there?

01:01:15,509 --> 01:01:20,134
Careful not to break necks!

531
01:01:22,342 --> 01:01:24,300
How to overcome that?

532
01:01:24,342 --> 01:01:28,300
It looks like The Blur, with
another layer of paint.

533
01:01:37,259 --> 01:01:41,592
We go to the rally! A place to win one!

534
01:01:41,634 --> 01:01:44,218

Yes, you!
- Your mom is ugly!

540
01:02:17,218 --> 01:02:21,508
The streets are marked with
arrows, and the race ends here.

541
01:02:21,509 --> 01:02:29,509
All right! This is a
place prize.About $ 500.

542
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:33,966
You say it's from an anonymous donor.

543
01:02:33,967 --> 01:02:35,134
It was done!

544
01:02:35,176 --> 01:02:41,342
Waldo, hurry .. I'm late!
- Be serious .. we make entry.

545
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:44,218
Relax, relax and leave everything to me!

546
01:02:49,675 --> 01:02:53,634
I wonder where is AJFerguson. I do not
know, but I can not wait to meet him.

547
01:02:53,675 --> 01:02:56,466
Well guys, put your seat belts!

548
01:02:56,467 --> 01:03:00,717
Oh, oh, Mr. Johnson.We are glad you came.

549
01:03:00,759 --> 01:03:02,884
Last car is in position.

550
01:03:03,884 --> 01:03:11,800
Oh, it's even Waldo.Not to get
all the money in the world

551
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:13,509
replace work and ingenuity.

552
01:03:14,176 --> 01:03:19,009
You have a rich fantasy.
- Thanks.

553
01:03:19,051 --> 01:03:21,299
Dickhead!

554
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,926
What do you do with that?
- Darla's handkerchief.

555
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:30,967
All Knights go to battle wearing
the colors of their beloved.

556
01:03:31,009 --> 01:03:33,467
I hear...

557
01:03:39,051 --> 01:03:44,884

559
01:04:02,675 --> 01:04:07,342
And also $ 500.

560
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:23,301
Gentlemen, start your engines!

561
01:04:31,759 --> 01:04:37,051

562
01:05:15,801 --> 01:05:17,675

You bastards have stolen our car!

564
01:05:51,926 --> 01:05:55,801
Who found it, it's either.

565
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:04,884
Waldo, I think we need to return here!

566
01:06:04,926 --> 01:06:09,467
Girls have a sense of orientation.
- You 'gives me the pip.

567
01:06:41,092 --> 01:06:43,009
Look out!

568
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:50,634

569
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:56,634

572
01:07:21,383 --> 01:07:24,675

Active rockets!

575
01:07:47,425 --> 01:07:52,675
You idiot! You put them backwards!

576
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:13,051
And two guys? Although I hate to do this.

577
01:08:15,176 --> 01:08:18,425
Spikes!

578
01:08:35,009 --> 01:08:39,550
You could kill them!
- Forget that one dork who eat soap!

579

balloon talent contest.

583
01:09:05,218 --> 01:09:08,925
Look, we're back in the race!

584
01:09:08,926 --> 01:09:10,967
Hey, good shortcut!

585
01:09:11,009 --> 01:09:17,550
Well, how they got here?
I do not worry .. this one to "help".

586
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,592
What is that?

587
01:09:28,926 --> 01:09:31,218

You're crazy!

597
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:31,051

I saw what you did with
my Batistuta, Alfalfa!

632
01:14:21,467 --> 01:14:26,299
My heart melted.
- And very romantic!

633
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:29,383
Thanks .. but I thought you hate me.

634
01:14:29,425 --> 01:14:33,092
I hate you .. just sometimes do bad things.

01:14:33,134 --> 01:14:38,841
As if, at the picnic.
- Can I explain it.

636
01:14:38,842 --> 01:14:44,217
I've ruined your Picnic with
alfalfa.You see, I thought trying to

637
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:49,091
steal my best friend. I thought
trying to sabotage our club.

638
01:14:49,092 --> 01:14:53,966
But I think I was wrong.Sorry!

639
01:14:53,967 --> 01:14:57,218
My Alfalfanatorul!

646
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:33,925
Does ancestors have betrayed us?

647
01:15:33,926 --> 01:15:39,884
I stopped generations
of men who hate women?

648
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:51,092
Hey, Oh learned a new word!

649
01:15:51,134 --> 01:15:58,218
In fact, I always had an extensive
vocabulary, and do not forget

650
01:15:58,259 --> 01:16:03,926
excellent grammar and syntax
developed a superlative.

651
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:06,550
I just chose not to use them.

652
01:16:18,092 --> 01:16:22,801
Well, I suppose that things
must change at last.

653
01:16:31,259 --> 01:16:32,675
What's my reply?

654
01:16:59,467 --> 01:17:03,176
Let's start again!
I do not want.
