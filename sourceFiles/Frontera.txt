1
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,161
Hey.

2
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,866
Hey, hey.

3
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,061
Mama...

4
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,370
You goin' for a ride?

5
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,574
Looks that way.

6
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:04,276
Want some company?

7
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,813
Your knee's not right.

8
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,682
Then I'll take the quad.

9
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,849
That thing spooks Shadow.
You know that.

10
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,957
Those stalls still need
to be cleaned out.

11
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,859
Unless you want to pay
somebody else to do it?

12
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,027
No. I'll do it.

13
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,196
Which trail are you taking?

14
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,634
The wash.

15
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,870
Why do you always got
to ride the damn wash?

16
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,040
- 'Cause it's the best trail.
- Yeah, it is.

17
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,307
That's why we can't keep the
damn Mexicans out of it.

18
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:46,265
If I see any "damn Mexicans,"

19
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,178
I'll tell 'em hello from you.

20
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,028
Did you bring a
walkie-talkie with you?

21
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,730
Yup!

22
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,431
Don't leave that
coffee cup out there.

23
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,317
Shit, dude! What the hell?

24
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,787
- We're going shooting today.
- So go.

25
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,289
Come with us, ass hat.

26
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,692
I don't feel like shooting cactus
with you two faggots today.

27
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,525
We're not shootin' cactus today.

28
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:37,302
- Come on.
- Ah! You dick!

29
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,280
Thank you. Thank you. Very.

30
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,416
You're very welcome.

31
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,651
The na... the name?

32
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,384
Do you speak English?

33
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,892
His name is Shadow.

34
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,593
Shadow.

35
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,293
It's okay.

36
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,803
<i>Sí, sí,</i> work.

37
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:20,351
Oh.

38
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,234
<i>Sí.</i>

39
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,995
Yes, please.

40
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,561
<i>Gracias, gracias.</i>

41
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,197
Sorry.

42
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,370
Okay.

43
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,779
Good day!

44
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,181
Good day.

45
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,271
No shit.

46
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,206
You guys! You guys, come here!

47
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,409
Quick!

48
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,213
There's some Mexicans
right there in the wash.

49
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,182
Where?

50
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:32,752
- Right there by that tree right there.
- I don't see 'em.

51
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,919
Use your scope, dude.

52
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,761
Okay, yeah, I got 'em.

53
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,530
Yeah, those guys
are definitely illegal.

54
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,866
- How do you know for sure?
- Duh, Sean.

55
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:50,034
You think they're here
just out for a stroll?

56
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,338
Hand me the 06.

57
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,708
No, dude, you can't just start
shooting at those guys.

58
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,412
I so knew you two fags
would puss out on me!

59
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:02,215
Look, I told you,
we're only gonna scare them.

60
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,317
You don't shoot at them.
You shoot near them.

61
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,219
- Now, give me the gun.
- Screw you.

62
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,554
Fine.

63
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,757
I'll use this old piece of shit.

64
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,493
Sure I don't miss and hit one of 'em.

65
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:18,164
You're such a dick. Just make sure
you aim way far away from them.

66
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,531
Yeah, no shit, bozo.

67
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,507
I'm just gonna scare 'em...

68
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,140
back across the line.

69
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,945
Oh!

70
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,380
Brad, what the hell?

71
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,283
- That last shot was way too close!
- I didn't hit him, Sean!

72
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:13,053
Besides, the point is to get close
so it scares the shit out of them.

73
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:16,722
Brad, check it out.
See that big ol' jug of water?

74
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:19,492
Yeah. I got it.

75
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,628
You hit that thing,
it'll scare the hell of out 'em.

76
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,363
Plus, they won't have
any water, right?

77
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:26,232
Then they'll totally have to run their
sorry ass back across the line.

78
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,301
Genius.

79
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:32,036
- Hey, hand me some more 06 shells, dude.
- Let me take a look at this shit.

80
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,447
Are you freaking crazy?
The thing's, like, right next to them.

81
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:42,548
You could totally screw that shot up!

82
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,318
We're not using my dad's rifle to
shoot that close to those guys.

83
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:46,820
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
It's cool, it's cool, it's cool.

84
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,088
Look, why don't you show Kev and I
what a safe distance is to be shot at?

85
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,077
It's a killer scope on that thing.
You're not gonna hit 'em.

86
00:19:54,177 --> 00:19:57,828
Go for it, Sean-o. You could
shoot the tits off a fly.

87
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,681
- No!
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

88
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:19,252
- Sean, you just took out that lady, man!
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

89
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,487
What the hell did you
shoot her for, dude?

90
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,822
I didn't shoot her, asshole!

91
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,725
She came over the wash! I was
trying to miss the fucking Mexican!

92
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,232
- Oh, God.
- She's moving.

93
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,962
- She's moving, dude. Look, look.
- You swear to God?

94
00:20:34,062 --> 00:20:35,826
I swear to God. Just look.

95
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,142
What are we gonna do?

96
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,477
We got to get out of here.

97
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,849
- What? We can't just leave her there!
- You want to go down there, Sean?

98
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:53,686
When we get back, we'll call 911
from a payphone or something.

99
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,821
Besides, the Mexican
guy was helping her!

100
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,133
Oh, f...

101
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:15,006
- Oh, what happened?
- Uh...

102
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,678
Where's Roy? Roy!

103
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,483
My horse?

104
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,722
Get my horse.

105
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,857
Jose!

106
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:38,464
My horse. My horse.

107
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:41,868
- I-I-I get horse.
- Get my horse.

108
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:46,538
Shadow?

109
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,510
Oh. Shadow.

110
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,092
- I have horse.
- All right.

111
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,900
Hey.

112
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,935
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

113
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,602
Hey!

114
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,739
Hey!

115
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:27,613
Roy.

116
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:34,853
- Livy.
- It's all right.

117
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,984
What are we gonna do?
My dad's gonna kill me!

118
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,587
Dude, your dad's never gonna
find out unless you freak out.

119
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,889
She looked pretty bad to me,
dude. Maybe he hit her.

120
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,691
I didn't hit her, you dick!
I was aiming at the ground!

121
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:16,113
Shut up, Kevin! Look, we got to swear
not to tell anybody about this ever.

122
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:19,532
Nobody! Because if anyone
finds out, we're all screwed!

123
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm not. I didn't even shoot at all!

124
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,504
It doesn't matter, dumbass.
You're an accessory to the crime.

125
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:27,639
- Sean's the one who shot her.
- Shut up!

126
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:56,033
<i>Amigos!</i>

127
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:21,224
Okay.

128
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:30,935
We're gonna have to ask
you some more questions.

129
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:35,575
Later. Tomorrow, I mean. Okay,
I'll drive you back to the house.

130
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:40,111
No, no, I got to put up Livy's horse.

131
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:44,416
Roy, we can get the
horse back to the barn.

132
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,984
Nope.

133
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,156
Uncle Roy?

134
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,626
Really sorry, Roy.

135
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:17,667
Roy, the sheriff mentioned they'd be
coming by here tomorrow morning, and...

136
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:20,606
Kaye and I thought we could
stay out here with you tonight.

137
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:23,141

142
00:29:00,971 --> 00:29:04,208

00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:33,210
You can click on that.
Scroll it down.

176
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:36,348
I know how to use
a computer, Randall.

177
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,417
Yeah, of course you do.

178
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:42,485
I mean, it's the same old thing we
had when you were on the job.

179
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:49,425
Okay, well, you let
me know how it goes.

180
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,924
Good morning.

181
00:39:15,024 --> 00:39:18,990
I'm going to be teaching the class today.
Mrs. Edwards has had a family emergency.

182
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:23,096
Hey, did you hear what happened?
Some illegals killed Mrs. McNary.

183
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:25,326
- Mrs. McNary?
- She was riding on her ranch,

184
00:39:25,426 --> 00:39:28,665
and they were trying to steal
her horse, and they killed her.

185
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,670
Young lady in the front,
please turn around.

186
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,837
I have to use the bathroom.

187
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,748
<i>Si.</i>

188
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,582
Says he's sure.

189
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,489
Roy's here.

190
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:00,522
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on, now.

191
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:03,194
Come on, back off.

192
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,296
That's not the guy I saw.

193
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,936
You're sure?

194
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:13,037
Yeah, I'm sure.

195
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:17,108
- Well, then, there may have been two.
- Why do you say that?

196
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:20,744
Well, we picked him up
in a stolen truck, and...

197
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:25,348
One of the things we found in the
truck was this. You recognize this?

198
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,950
Yeah.

199
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:34,993
Soon as we told him what happened,
he started talkin' pretty fast.

200
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,859
He told us that he and another
guy that he was traveling with...

201
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:40,632
met up with a woman on a horse,
and she gave him that blanket.

202
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:44,541
He says that somebody was shooting
at him, and the lady fell off her horse...

203
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:47,038
- and hit her head.
- That's a bunch of bullshit.

204
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,841
I know, I'm just... just telling
you what the man said,

205
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,643
keeping you in the
loop like I promised.

206
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:54,646
I should have shot that son of
a bitch when I had the chance.

207
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:58,782
I saw that you had a firearm
on you when we got there.

208
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:02,025
- Were you shootin' at 'em, Roy?
- No.

209
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:04,721
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

210
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:08,763
- There were shots.
- There were shots?

211
00:42:08,863 --> 00:42:13,098
Yeah, they were rifle shots. That's why
I went out there in the first place.

212
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:17,068
Well, why the hell didn't you tell me that
before? That's pretty damned important.

213
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:19,771
I don't know, I...

214
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,740
Hell, Randall, I mean, we was...

215
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:25,610
All right, somethin' else.

216
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,748
Now, our man in there I.D.'d the
same guy you did in the mugs.

217
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:32,882
- He did?
- He did.

218
00:43:01,077 --> 00:43:02,881
- Hello, Matthew.
- How are you, Martha?

219
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:06,817
Good, good. Got that good
apple wine ready for you.

220
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:10,153
- That's why I'm here.
- Okay.

221
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:31,910
- There you go.
- Thank you.

222
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,344
- You got it.
- All right.

223
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,412
- Give my best to your wife.
- I will.

224
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,436
No.

225
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,092
No. Oh.

226
00:44:56,094 --> 00:44:59,130
You're sure that's the guy
you standin' over Livy, right?

227
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:04,433
- Yeah, that's him.
- Well, then I'd say we got our guy.

228
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,402
Hmm.

229
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,407
What?

230
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:11,183
I don't know.

231
00:45:11,283 --> 00:45:16,447
Come on, Roy. How many times you and
I stood here and watched these boys...

232
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,335
lie through their teeth just so
we'd send 'em back across the line

233
00:45:19,435 --> 00:45:23,053
- with a spanking and a warning?
- A bunch.

234
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:27,809
I know it's not much for comfort, and
it ain't gonna bring Livy back, but...

235
00:45:27,909 --> 00:45:32,353
we got him, and he's
gonna be punished.

236
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,466
Did you already have
your boys do a sweep?

237
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,603
Yeah, but they didn't find anything,
but now I know you heard those shots too

238
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:41,139
I'm having 'em do
another broader search.

239
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:45,133
- Yeah, when? I told you that yesterday.
- Terrence is doin' a transport,

240
00:45:45,233 --> 00:45:48,377
and Matthew and Lewis are
pickin' up the slack, so soon.

241
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,986
This afternoon, or early
tomorrow morning, latest.

242
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:58,156
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

243
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:01,790
Roy.

244
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,729
We got him.

245
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,548
<i>¿Bueno?</i>

246
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,226
Paulina!

247
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,695
<i>Vámonos!</i>

248
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,353
<i>Vamos, vamos.</i>

249
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,469
Hello.

250
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,744
<i>Vámonos.</i>

251
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:04,481
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

252
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,535
<i>No! No!</i>

253
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:26,705
<i>No!</i>

254
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:05,608
<i>Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

255
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:10,780
<i>Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

256
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:16,419
<i>Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

257
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:21,658
<i>Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

258
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:02,231
Hey!

259
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:02,059
No, no, no.

260
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:10,494
No. No, no, no, no.

261
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,698
Shh, shh, shh.

262
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:19,863
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

263
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:39,981
<i>Bueno.</i>

264
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:46,776
<i>Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

265
01:00:47,778 --> 01:00:50,447
<i>Hello, I'm calling from
family first funeral service.</i>

266
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:53,616
<i>We wanted to let you know that
we've completed the process,</i>

267
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:57,287
<i>and you can pick up the
ashes at your convenience.</i>

268
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:15,505
Uncle Roy?

269
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:35,359
- Going for a ride?
- Looks that way.

270
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:37,828
Want some company?

271
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:41,398
No.

272
01:01:46,068 --> 01:01:48,303
No, I don't.

273
01:01:48,605 --> 01:01:51,507
But thank you, Kaye.

274
01:01:52,009 --> 01:01:54,779
Thanks for offerin'.

275
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:06,321
You bring that pony back wet,
you'll catch hell from me. Understood?

276
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,793
Yes, ma'am.

277
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:46,790
- What are you doin' up here?
- This is where the shooter was.

278
01:08:48,992 --> 01:08:52,696
That's got to be well over 800 yards.
Are you sure it was from here?

279
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:57,933
I saw him from that bluff over there,
above the wash where Livy was killed.

280
01:08:58,935 --> 01:09:01,704
That's where I found these.

281
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:06,743
- Roy...
- Found the leads down in the wash.

282
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:10,180
Maybe you could match some of those up
with the lead in that body down there.

283
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,849
Roy, you know you shouldn't...

284
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:15,919
You shouldn't have moved these.
Hell, you shouldn't even be up here.

285
01:09:16,019 --> 01:09:21,290
This is my land, Randall. Well,
somebody's got to do your job for you.

286
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:25,093
Check 'em out. They're marked.

287
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:29,164
Shooter must do his own reloads.

288
01:09:31,266 --> 01:09:33,303
Did you get a maker on the vehicle?

289
01:09:33,403 --> 01:09:36,975
No. Some kind of a
four by four. Green.

290
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:43,380
Not many guys around
who can make that shot.

291
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:47,283
Yeah, well, there's plenty of people pretty
angry about what happened to Livy, Roy.

292
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:51,785
Well, those people got no more business
bein' on my land than the damn Mexicans.

293
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:54,360
Randall...

294
01:09:55,286 --> 01:09:56,859
I want to talk to Ramirez.

295
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:59,663
You know I can't allow that.
You're officially a civilian.

296
01:09:59,763 --> 01:10:03,733
Besides, you're the spouse of the victim,
and that man is the prime suspect.

297
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:06,302
- How's it gonna look...
- I spent over 25 years sittin'

298
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:09,973
in the same chair you park your
butt in now, the chair I put you in.

299
01:10:10,073 --> 01:10:13,543
I know better than anybody that there's
a lot of things you can't do as sheriff,

300
01:10:13,643 --> 01:10:16,746
but lettin' me talk to
Ramirez ain't one of 'em.

301
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:57,453
I have to...

302
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,968
You got five minutes.

303
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,985
Jesus, Roy.

304
01:12:24,172 --> 01:12:25,974
Yeah.

305
01:12:26,976 --> 01:12:28,777
It figures.

306
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,186
No.

307
01:12:39,821 --> 01:12:41,458
<i>- ¿Carro?</i>
<i>- Si.</i>

308
01:12:41,558 --> 01:12:42,690
No.

309
01:14:00,435 --> 01:14:02,672
Oh, hi.

310
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:04,474
I'm so sorry I'm late.

311
01:14:04,574 --> 01:14:07,043
That's okay. We've just
been here a few minutes.

312
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:08,945
- I'm Marily.
- Hi.

313
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:10,480
How do you like the
front of the house?

314
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:11,881
- And the neighborhood?
- It's good.

315
01:14:11,981 --> 01:14:13,116
- Oh, good.
- Good.

316
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:15,652
I have the code to the garage,
and I can open the front door

317
01:14:15,752 --> 01:14:18,254
and let myself in that way,
and then I can let you in.

318
01:14:19,756 --> 01:14:21,757
Ah, there it is.

319
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:34,103
Oh-oh, my...

320
01:14:48,716 --> 01:14:50,753
Sean!

321
01:14:52,055 --> 01:14:54,389
Sean!

322
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:57,226
Sean Louis Pat!

323
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:58,795
What?

324
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:01,598
Your dad wants to see
you in the garage!

325
01:15:01,698 --> 01:15:03,266
Why?

326
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:07,537
Why?

327
01:15:09,517 --> 01:15:13,576
- Why?
- But he said right now.

328
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:34,528
Those were out on the ground off the
South Ridge of Roy McNary's land.

329
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:38,301
And my .30-06 reloads.

330
01:15:38,401 --> 01:15:40,903
I haven't been out
there huntin', son.

331
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:44,173
Besides, I always pick up my empties.

332
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:47,910
I even make a mark
on 'em with a sharpie,

333
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:52,914
just so I can tell
which ones are mine.

334
01:15:57,485 --> 01:16:00,054
Those are mine.

335
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:14,236
Any idea how they got out there, son?

336
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:18,007
What the hell were you thinking?
Was this your stupid idea?

337
01:16:18,107 --> 01:16:19,909
Don't you turn your back on me!

338
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:23,078
Let me talk. Let me talk to him.

339
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:43,432
Well, the boys are tellin'
different stories.

340
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:46,034
Two of 'em are sayin' that they
were shooting at the Mexicans...

341
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:48,805
'cause they were beating on Livy
and tryin' to steal her horse.

342
01:16:48,905 --> 01:16:52,007
You know damned well
that's not what happened.

343
01:16:53,009 --> 01:16:54,909
Do I?

344
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:58,047
I mean, you thought those Mexicans
were beatin' on Livy too.

345
01:16:58,147 --> 01:17:01,818
I sat here and listened to you
tell me when you pulled up,

346
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:04,220
that Mexican was trying
to steal Livy's horse.

347
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,356
- Randall...
- That's what you said.

348
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,894
What... what do we got here really?

349
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:16,199
Roy, I mean... so now we know that the
boys were shooting at the Mexicans.

350
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:21,103
Livy didn't die of a gunshot
wound, Roy. That's a fact.

351
01:17:25,473 --> 01:17:28,609
He's my son, for God's sake.

352
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:32,213
Livy was my wife.

353
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:41,522
Who was the shooter?

354
01:17:41,624 --> 01:17:45,293
Well, the boys are tellin'
different stories, and they're...

355
01:17:45,393 --> 01:17:48,731
- all trying to back each other...
- Randall.

356
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:53,869
Who was the shooter?

357
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:58,706
Sean.

358
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:01,679
The shooter was Sean.

359
01:18:11,919 --> 01:18:13,991
- Flora, can it wait?
- Just thought both you sheriffs...

360
01:18:14,091 --> 01:18:16,826
might want to know that a lady called
over here just now and said she found

361
01:18:16,926 --> 01:18:19,695
a bunch of illegals hiding
out in a garage in Phoenix.

362
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:23,166
She said one of the illegals asked
her to call over here for her.

363
01:18:23,266 --> 01:18:26,501
She said the woman is
Miguel Ramirez's wife.

364
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:10,412
Melina Ramirez?

365
01:20:28,556 --> 01:20:32,060
<i>Si?</i> Flora?

366
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,600
Jesus. I'll call you
back in a minute.

367
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:15,238
- Roy! Roy, you can't take her in there.
- Well, Flora and I just came by.

368
01:21:15,338 --> 01:21:19,208
- We, uh, both have to pee.
- Oh, stop! You can't take her in there!

369
01:21:19,308 --> 01:21:20,543
No, no, don't.

370
01:21:20,643 --> 01:21:23,145
Miss Flora, she can't be in there.
You can't go in there.

371
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:25,848
Where are the boys at? Where's Sean?

372
01:21:25,948 --> 01:21:28,582
Anybody but Ramirez been charged yet?

373
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:45,835
You know those boys
aren't flight risk.

374
01:21:45,935 --> 01:21:47,670
Now, they've been released
to their parents recognizance.

375
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:51,199
Well, that's a dumb idea since it was on
your and their parents recognizance...

376
01:21:51,299 --> 01:21:55,044
that the boys are out there poppin'
off rounds at people in the first place.

377
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:59,642
- No, you tell them...
- Did you talk to the D.A. yet?

378
01:22:59,742 --> 01:23:01,381
You told him what's goin' on here?

379
01:23:01,481 --> 01:23:05,170
You told him about your
boy's involvement? Huh?

380
01:23:10,119 --> 01:23:11,420
No, no, no...

381
01:23:24,299 --> 01:23:26,101
You go ahead and you
call him, and you tell him

382
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:28,968
how you tampered with
the damned evidence!

383
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:53,222
- Hello, Señor.
- <i>Hola.</i>

384
01:24:53,322 --> 01:24:57,925
Thank you for, uh,
bringing <i>mija</i> my house.

385
01:25:14,942 --> 01:25:16,977
<i>Gracias.</i>

386
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,022
Son-in-law.

387
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:29,356
Oh, <i>si.</i>

388
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:39,900
<i>Bueno.</i>

389
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:26,982
- Evening.
- Good evening.

390
01:26:27,082 --> 01:26:29,418
- Citizenship?
- American.

391
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:32,486
- Do you have some I.D.?
- I do.

392
01:26:32,888 --> 01:26:35,557
- Roy?
- Edward.

393
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:37,226
Hi, Flora. How are you?

394
01:26:37,326 --> 01:26:39,762
Oh, good to see you, Edward.

395
01:26:39,862 --> 01:26:43,766
Hey, Roy, listen. I was really
sorry to hear about Livy.

396
01:26:45,768 --> 01:26:49,704
- What are you doing in Mexico?
- Droppin' off a friend.

397
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,509
- Okay.
- Okay.

398
01:26:53,609 --> 01:26:55,976
Well, it was good to see you both.

399
01:26:56,578 --> 01:26:58,179
Same here.

400
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:19,902
You can't walk in here and tell
me that Ramirez is without blame.

401
01:27:20,002 --> 01:27:23,071
I mean, none of this would have happened if
it hadn't been for those goddamn Mexicans

402
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:25,318
- walkin' across your land.
- None of this would have happened...

403
01:27:25,418 --> 01:27:29,042
if you'd changed the combination
on your goddamn gun locker.

404
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:37,920
Okay, but you got to
do one thing for me.

405
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:42,358
Those boys got to pay for what
they did, Randall. Sean does too.

406
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:44,882
I know that, and I know he does,
and he's gonna have to live with it...

407
01:27:44,982 --> 01:27:48,495
- for the rest of his life.
- So do I.

408
01:27:48,897 --> 01:27:51,133
All I'm asking you...

409
01:27:51,735 --> 01:27:56,605
is that you say something on
his behalf at the deposition.

410
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:02,449
I'm asking you as a father,

411
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:05,410
and as a friend.

412
01:28:06,547 --> 01:28:09,583
It was an accident.

413
01:28:10,185 --> 01:28:12,520
Randall...

414
01:28:14,322 --> 01:28:19,226
The only way I will do that is if he tells
the truth about what happened out there.

415
01:28:19,828 --> 01:28:21,630
He will.

416
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:25,534
You know, being a
dumbass is no excuse.

417
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:28,438
I know that.

418
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,673
All right.

419
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,615
Yours?

420
01:29:15,617 --> 01:29:18,054
Mine and my wife's.

421
01:29:34,503 --> 01:29:37,337
- Horse man.
- Oh, <i>si.</i>

422
01:29:48,883 --> 01:29:50,917
Shadow.

423
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:07,802
Yeah.

424
01:30:08,604 --> 01:30:11,239
Livy loved her pony.

425
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,291
Come on, Philly!

426
01:33:50,324 --> 01:33:52,392
Advance.

427
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:09,778
- Right.
- Okay.

428
01:34:09,878 --> 01:34:11,911
Okay.

429
01:34:22,122 --> 01:34:24,124
<i>Bueno.</i>

430
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:33,132
Yeah, so you better <i>ándale, Señor.</i>

431
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:35,670
Good.

432
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:50,851
<i>Si.</i>

433
01:34:51,253 --> 01:34:52,919
Okay.

434
01:34:56,722 --> 01:34:58,591
<i>Adios.</i>
