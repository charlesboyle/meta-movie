1
00:00:48,545 --> 00:00:51,275
So good of you to come see me, Mr. Bond.

2
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:53,915
Particularly on such short notice.

3
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:58,009
lf you can't trust a Swiss banker,
what's the world come to?

4
00:00:59,088 --> 00:01:01,454
Bon!
And now that we're all comfortable...

5
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:03,453
...why don't you sit down?

6
00:01:04,928 --> 00:01:06,555
It was not easy...

7
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:08,856
...but I have retrieved the money.

8
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:12,957
No doubt Sir Robert will be
pleased to see it again.

9
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:17,333
At the current rate of exchange,
minus the fees and certain...

10
00:01:17,574 --> 00:01:19,337
...unforeseeable expenses.

11
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:21,443
Voila, the receipt.

12
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:23,805
Would you like to check my figures?

13
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:27,245
I'm sure they're perfectly rounded.

14
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:30,408
It's all there.

15
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,178
I didn't come for the money.

16
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:35,484
The report Sir Robert bought was stolen...

17
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:37,751
...from an MI6 agent who was killed for it.

18
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:42,797
I want to know who killed him.

19
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:45,763
-Terrible tragedy.
-I just want a name.

20
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:49,529
I am merely the middleman.
I'm trying to do the honorable thing...

21
00:01:49,772 --> 00:01:52,206
...returning the money to its rightful owner.

22
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:55,844
We know how difficult
that can be for a Swiss banker.

23
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,516
I am offering you the opportunity
to walk out with the money.

24
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:08,446
And I'm giving you the opportunity
to walk out with your life.

25
00:02:08,658 --> 00:02:10,216
Looking at our present situation...

26
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:12,087
...as a banker, I'd have to say...

27
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:14,855
...that the numbers are not on your side.

28
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:18,230
Perhaps you failed to take into account...

29
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:20,402
...my hidden assets.

30
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:33,779
You've had a small reversal of fortune.

31
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:36,810
-Give me the name.
-I can't tell you.

32
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,681
Let's count to three.

33
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:41,218
You can do that, can't you?

34
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:42,480
One.

35
00:02:44,093 --> 00:02:45,082
Two.

36
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:46,586
All right.

37
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,725
But you'll have to protect me--

38
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:49,843
James.

39
00:04:50,053 --> 00:04:52,419
Have you brought me
a souvenir from your trip?

40
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:53,680
Chocolates?

41
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,482
An engagement ring?

42
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:58,324
I thought you'd enjoy one of these.

43
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:00,718
How romantic.

44
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:05,260
I know exactly where to put that.

45
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:11,297
Oh, Moneypenny.

46
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,566
The story of our relationship:

47
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,903
close, but no cigar.

48
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:20,673
<i>I hate to tear you away from affairs of state.
Would you mind coming in?</i>

49
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:24,277
Right away, M.

50
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:27,987
Sir Robert King, James Bond.

51
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:32,992
The man who retrieved my money.
Thank you. Excellent work.

52
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:35,591
Be careful, M.
I might steal him from you.

53
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:39,193
Construction's not exactly my specialty.

54
00:05:39,435 --> 00:05:41,164
Quite the opposite, in fact.

55
00:05:42,638 --> 00:05:43,468
Best to the family.

56
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:49,845
Old friend?

57
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:52,715
We read law at Oxford together.

58
00:05:53,683 --> 00:05:55,810
I always knew he'd conquer the world.

59
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:57,843
Care for a drink?

60
00:05:58,054 --> 00:05:59,021
Yes, thank you.

61
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,481
He's a man of great integrity.

62
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:06,155
Who buys stolen reports
for 3 million pounds.

63
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:07,787
Thank you.

64
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:10,159
Any leads on the sniper?

65
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,690
Not one.

66
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:13,160
Professional job.

67
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:15,627
She must be working for someone.

68
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,266
-Is this the stolen report?
-Yes. Classified.

69
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:20,373
From the Russian Atomic Energy Department.

70
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,168
What would King want this for?

71
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:25,804
He was led to believe
the document was a secret report...

72
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:30,213
...identifying the terrorists
who'd attacked his new oil pipeline.

73
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:32,213
Interesting.

74
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:37,682
It doesn't explain why someone
would want me out of their office alive.

75
00:06:46,068 --> 00:06:47,433
King! The money.

76
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:50,061
Moneypenny, stop King.

77
00:06:58,281 --> 00:06:59,407
Move! Move, move!

78
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,315
Get out of the way!

79
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:06,785
Stop!

80
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:44,718
Move!

81
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:46,622
Get out of the way! Move!

82
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:56,904
Stop, stop!

83
00:07:57,106 --> 00:07:58,971
It isn't finished!

84
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:05,973
Let go!

85
00:13:06,182 --> 00:13:08,150
-What do you think you're--?
-Let go!

86
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:38,406
Listen to me!

87
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:40,174
You can't get away.

88
00:13:40,683 --> 00:13:42,776
We can make a deal.
Tell me who's behind this...

89
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:43,974
...who you work for.

90
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:45,475
Don't do it!

91
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:47,053
Don't blow us up!

92
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:48,153
I can protect you.

93
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,515
Do you understand?
I can protect you.

94
00:13:50,993 --> 00:13:52,392
Not from him!

95
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:21,462
Hello, my dear.

96
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,045
Who is that young woman?

97
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:38,018
King's daughter.

98
00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:39,584
Elektra.

99
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:41,681
Thank you.

100
00:17:44,526 --> 00:17:46,153
The money was dipped in urea.

101
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:49,957
A highly compacted fertilizer bomb.

102
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:52,497
Having handled the money,
the water on 007's hands...

103
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:55,397
...when he touched the ice,
started a chemical reaction.

104
00:17:55,638 --> 00:17:59,665
In one note, the anti-counterfeiting strip
was replaced with magnesium...

105
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:03,105
...which acted as a detonator.
And King's lapel pin...

106
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:04,802
...was switched for a copy...

107
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:08,745
...which contained a radio transmitter
to trigger the blast.

108
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:12,148
In other words,
he set off the bomb that killed him.

109
00:18:13,022 --> 00:18:15,286
We know it was someone close to King...

110
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,654
...and our only lead
committed suicide on that balloon.

111
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:21,322
But given the size of King's organization...

112
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,862
...it could be anyone, anywhere.

113
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:30,602
This will not stand.

114
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:34,872
We won't be terrorized by cowards
who'd murder an innocent man...

115
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:36,510
...and use us as the tool.

116
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:38,770
We'll find those who committed this atrocity.

117
00:18:38,981 --> 00:18:42,542
We'll follow them to the farthest
ends of the earth, if needs be.

118
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:45,785
And we will bring them to justice.

119
00:18:59,101 --> 00:18:59,965
Tanner!

120
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:04,366
M says you're off the active-duty list
until you're cleared by medical.

121
00:19:10,012 --> 00:19:11,639
Dislocated collarbone.

122
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:15,840
If any more tendons snap,
I'm afraid you'll be out of action for weeks.

123
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:20,180
Molly...

124
00:19:20,989 --> 00:19:23,150
...I need a clean bill of health.

125
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:25,683
You have to clear me for duty.

126
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:30,728
-That wouldn't really be--
-Ethical?

127
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:32,993
Practical.

128
00:19:33,402 --> 00:19:34,494
Smart.

129
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:37,132
Well, let's just...

130
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:39,507
...skirt the issue, shall we?

131
00:19:42,611 --> 00:19:44,602
You'd have to promise to call me...

132
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,338
...this time.

133
00:19:46,915 --> 00:19:48,906
Whatever the doctor orders.

134
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:52,916
I suppose if you stayed in constant contact--

135
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:54,248
Of course.

136
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:57,457
If you showed sufficient stamina...

137
00:19:58,127 --> 00:20:01,722
-...cut out all kinds of--
-Strenuous activity?

138
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:26,884
I suppose we all have to
pay the piper sometime, right, Q?

139
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:29,580
Oh, pipe down, 007.

140
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:31,650
Was it something I said?

141
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,260
No. Something you destroyed.

142
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,220
My fishing boat.

143
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:38,122
For my retirement...

144
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,925
...away from you.

145
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:46,036
Now, I want to introduce you
to the young fellow...

146
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:48,141
...I'm grooming to follow me.

147
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:00,949
Helps to open the door.

148
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:03,786
And you might be...?

149
00:21:03,992 --> 00:21:05,892
This is 007.

150
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:08,824
If you're Q, does that make him R?

151
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:12,662
Yes, the legendary 007 wit.

152
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:14,968
Or at least half of it.

153
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:18,401
Now, I dare say, 007,
that you've met...

154
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,505
...your match with this machine.

155
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:23,377
New model? Improved specs?

156
00:21:24,546 --> 00:21:27,174
I thought you were
on the inactive roster. Some injury?

157
00:21:27,683 --> 00:21:29,048
We'll see about that.

158
00:21:29,852 --> 00:21:33,481
As I was saying, the very latest
in interception countermeasures.

159
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:37,318
Titanium armor,
a multitasking heads-up display...

160
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:40,552
...and six beverage cup holders.

161
00:21:40,762 --> 00:21:43,162
All in all, rather stocked.

162
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:46,056
''Fully loaded,'' I think is the term.

163
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:48,929
-I think--
-You're not here to think.

164
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:50,968
You're here to do what I tell you.

165
00:21:51,173 --> 00:21:52,606
Now, go put on the coat...

166
00:21:52,975 --> 00:21:55,136
...and demonstrate it for 007.

167
00:21:55,344 --> 00:21:56,743
But of course.

168
00:21:56,945 --> 00:21:59,937
Now watch closely, please, 007.

169
00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:03,450
The right arm goes in the right sleeve, thus...

170
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:07,110
...and the left arm in the left sleeve, thus.

171
00:22:07,322 --> 00:22:11,258
Note closely, please:
pockets, poppers and zipper.

172
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,690
Take the lower part of the zipper...

173
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:15,295
...and insert it into--

174
00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:16,759
Pull the tag.

175
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:19,564
You said--

176
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,570
He seems well-suited for the job.

177
00:22:29,578 --> 00:22:31,739
You're not retiring anytime soon...

178
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:35,307
...are you?

179
00:22:35,517 --> 00:22:37,417
Now, pay attention, 007.

180
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:39,849
I've always tried to teach you two things:

181
00:22:40,055 --> 00:22:43,218
First, never let them see you bleed.

182
00:22:43,725 --> 00:22:44,783
And the second?

183
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:48,052
Always have an escape plan.

184
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:04,770
<i>Good evening.
The Elektra King kidnap ordeal is over.</i>

185
00:23:05,347 --> 00:23:07,747
<i>The Cyprus authorities say
she has escaped...</i>

186
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,181
<i>...after shooting dead
two of her captors and is--</i>

187
00:23:15,357 --> 00:23:16,187
<i>He shouted.</i>

188
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:20,958
<i>Shouted all the time.</i>

189
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:14,915
<i>Level one clearance required.</i>

190
00:24:15,117 --> 00:24:17,176
<i>Level one clearance required.</i>

191
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:23,653
Yes, 007?

192
00:24:24,226 --> 00:24:26,694
Tell me about
the kidnapping of Elektra King.

193
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:29,295
I wasn't aware
you had an assignment on this case.

194
00:24:29,498 --> 00:24:31,966
I brought the money in that killed King.

195
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:35,034
-Don't make this personal.
-I'm not. Are you?

196
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:40,907
You're the only one who could seal her file.

197
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,407
Will you excuse us?

198
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:55,750
I will not tolerate insubordination, 007.

199
00:25:02,998 --> 00:25:04,056
What happened?

200
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:10,033
After Elektra King was kidnapped...

201
00:25:10,972 --> 00:25:13,668
...her father tried to deal with it on his own...

202
00:25:14,543 --> 00:25:16,170
...with no success.

203
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:18,645
So he came to me.

204
00:25:29,858 --> 00:25:33,589
As you are aware,
we do not negotiate with terrorists.

205
00:25:35,363 --> 00:25:37,524
And against every instinct in my heart...

206
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:41,558
...every emotion as a mother...

207
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,197
...I told him not to pay the ransom.

208
00:25:44,906 --> 00:25:47,204
I thought we had time on our side.

209
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:51,074
You used the girl as bait.

210
00:25:55,951 --> 00:25:58,818
The money in King's briefcase
was the same amount...

211
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:02,018
...as the ransom demand for his daughter.

212
00:26:08,196 --> 00:26:09,686
It's a message.

213
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:12,866
Your terrorist is back.

214
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:21,265
Victor Zokas.

215
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,670
A.k.a....

216
00:26:22,878 --> 00:26:23,970
Renard.

217
00:26:24,246 --> 00:26:25,338
The anarchist.

218
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:29,610
He was operating in Moscow in 1996.
Pyongyang, North Korea before that.

219
00:26:29,818 --> 00:26:31,183
And he's been spotted...

220
00:26:31,386 --> 00:26:35,379
...in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq,
Iran, Beirut and Cambodia.

221
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,957
All the romantic vacation spots.

222
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:41,186
His only goal is chaos.

223
00:26:41,396 --> 00:26:44,661
After Robert came to me,
I sent 009 to kill Renard.

224
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,196
Before he completed the mission...

225
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:48,527
...Elektra escaped.

226
00:26:49,671 --> 00:26:51,832
A week later, our man caught up with him.

227
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:53,969
He put a bullet in his head.

228
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:56,070
That bullet's still there.

229
00:26:57,012 --> 00:26:58,309
How did he survive?

230
00:26:58,914 --> 00:27:01,405
The doctor who saved Renard
couldn't get the bullet out...

231
00:27:01,616 --> 00:27:03,447
...so Renard killed him.

232
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,653
It's moving through the medulla oblongata,
killing off his senses.

233
00:27:08,857 --> 00:27:10,290
Touch, smell.

234
00:27:10,492 --> 00:27:11,891
He feels no pain.

235
00:27:12,093 --> 00:27:15,494
He can push himself harder,
longer than any normal man.

236
00:27:15,697 --> 00:27:17,392
The bullet will kill him...

237
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,830
...but he'll grow stronger every day
until the day he dies.

238
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:25,840
Robert is dead.

239
00:27:26,408 --> 00:27:28,433
MI6 is humiliated.

240
00:27:28,844 --> 00:27:30,311
He's had his revenge.

241
00:27:32,113 --> 00:27:33,307
Not quite.

242
00:27:34,282 --> 00:27:37,217
Renard had three enemies in that kidnapping.

243
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,183
And there's still one he hasn't touched.

244
00:27:41,823 --> 00:27:42,653
Elektra.

245
00:27:49,297 --> 00:27:51,424
I see the good doctor has cleared you.

246
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:53,999
Notes you have exceptional stamina.

247
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,464
I'm sure she was touched by his dedication...

248
00:27:59,307 --> 00:28:01,138
...to the job in hand.

249
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:05,678
007, I want you to go to Elektra.

250
00:28:06,114 --> 00:28:09,811
She's taken over the construction
of her father's oil pipeline.

251
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:12,119
Find who switched that pin.

252
00:28:12,554 --> 00:28:15,079
If your instincts are right,
Renard will be back...

253
00:28:15,757 --> 00:28:17,987
...and Elektra will be the next target.

254
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:19,825
The worm on the hook again.

255
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:22,826
She doesn't need to know
the same man may be after her.

256
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:24,430
Don't frighten her.

257
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,395
A shadow operation?

258
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:27,625
Remember...

259
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:30,469
...shadows stay in front or behind.

260
00:28:30,972 --> 00:28:32,462
Never on top.

261
00:29:34,803 --> 00:29:37,533
You, go back. Leave.
This area is closed.

262
00:29:37,772 --> 00:29:39,637
I'm here to see Elektra King.

263
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:42,002
James Bond, Universal Exports.

264
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,576
And I'm Davidov, chief of security.

265
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:47,043
We're having problems with the villagers.

266
00:29:48,616 --> 00:29:51,608
I've told Miss King
to stay at the office in Baku.

267
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:53,982
Oh, hell.

268
00:30:14,342 --> 00:30:17,402
-Miss King, I told you to--
-I know what you told me.

269
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,719
Send the pipe around.

270
00:31:05,927 --> 00:31:08,555
It's going to take weeks and cost millions.

271
00:31:08,763 --> 00:31:12,699
-Your father approved this route.
-Then my father was wrong. Do it.

272
00:31:13,635 --> 00:31:14,966
-Davidov--
-I'll talk to her.

273
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:21,369
I saw you at my father's funeral.

274
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:24,343
I'm sorry.

275
00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:27,848
M told me she was sending someone.
Mr...?

276
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:29,674
Bond.

277
00:31:30,118 --> 00:31:31,016
James Bond.

278
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:34,650
Did you know my father?

279
00:31:35,323 --> 00:31:37,484
I met him once, briefly.

280
00:31:38,426 --> 00:31:41,122
You seem to have inherited
his touch for diplomacy.

281
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:42,762
Saving the church?

282
00:31:42,964 --> 00:31:44,955
And avoiding the bloodshed.

283
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,229
100 years ago, my mother's family
discovered the oil here.

284
00:31:49,471 --> 00:31:51,803
When the Soviet Union was formed...

285
00:31:52,073 --> 00:31:54,234
...the Communists spent the next 70 years...

286
00:31:54,476 --> 00:31:56,944
...plundering our countryside for it.

287
00:31:57,412 --> 00:31:59,277
I saw their mess on the drive in.

288
00:32:00,181 --> 00:32:02,877
The new pipeline will guarantee our future.

289
00:32:04,185 --> 00:32:08,144
But it would be a crime
to destroy what little is left of our past.

290
00:32:14,195 --> 00:32:17,221
But you didn't come here
to talk about oil, did you?

291
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:19,693
Tell me...

292
00:32:22,737 --> 00:32:25,228
...have you ever lost a loved one, Mr. Bond?

293
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:31,244
M sent me because your life might be in danger.

294
00:32:35,116 --> 00:32:37,710
Please, I want to show you something.

295
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:42,181
I'm trying to build
an 800-mile pipeline through Turkey...

296
00:32:42,824 --> 00:32:45,418
...past the terrorists in Iraq...

297
00:32:45,627 --> 00:32:46,992
...Iran and Syria.

298
00:32:47,595 --> 00:32:48,789
Up here...

299
00:32:48,997 --> 00:32:51,363
...the Russians have three competing pipelines...

300
00:32:51,566 --> 00:32:53,898
...and they'll do anything to stop me.

301
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:57,602
My father was murdered,
the villagers are rioting...

302
00:32:58,273 --> 00:33:00,173
...and you have come all this way...

303
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,843
...to tell me that I ''might'' be in danger?

304
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:08,244
We suspect there is an insider.

305
00:33:11,252 --> 00:33:12,879
My father's pin.

306
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:14,076
No, a duplicate.

307
00:33:14,822 --> 00:33:17,814
With a transmitter inside
that set off the bomb.

308
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:21,427
My family has relied on MI6 twice, Mr. Bond.

309
00:33:21,663 --> 00:33:24,029
I won't make that mistake a third time.

310
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:30,103
I'm going to finish building this pipeline...

311
00:33:30,305 --> 00:33:32,034
...and I don't need your help.

312
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:35,442
If you'll excuse me,
I have to check the survey lines.

313
00:33:35,643 --> 00:33:38,077
I've always wanted
to check the survey lines.

314
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,743
You don't take no for an answer.

315
00:33:45,053 --> 00:33:46,748
I hope you know how to ski, then.

316
00:33:48,623 --> 00:33:51,114
I came prepared for a cold reception.

317
00:34:08,476 --> 00:34:09,306
Can't land.

318
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,807
Wind's too strong.

319
00:34:11,546 --> 00:34:12,672
Hold her steady.

320
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:22,113
You ski very well, Mr. Bond.

321
00:35:22,317 --> 00:35:24,444
Seems you enjoy being chased.

322
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,245
Happens all the time.

323
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:28,815
Less often than you might think.

324
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:31,520
So this is where they meet...

325
00:35:31,826 --> 00:35:33,316
...the two ends of the pipeline.

326
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:35,192
Your father's legacy.

327
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:37,193
My family's legacy...

328
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:39,097
...to the world.

329
00:35:49,143 --> 00:35:51,634
-Expecting visitors?
-No.

330
00:35:59,354 --> 00:36:01,345
This isn't a social call.

331
00:36:01,889 --> 00:36:04,722
Head for the gully.
I'll lead them into the trees.

332
00:36:04,926 --> 00:36:05,824
Go, go!

333
00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:09,914
See you back at the lodge.

334
00:39:29,931 --> 00:39:32,024
-It's all right.
-We're buried alive!

335
00:39:34,936 --> 00:39:36,403
I can't stay here!

336
00:39:36,604 --> 00:39:37,969
You're not going to.

337
00:39:42,076 --> 00:39:44,442
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

338
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:47,705
Look at me. Elektra, look at me!
Look at my eyes.

339
00:39:47,915 --> 00:39:49,246
Look at my eyes.

340
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,747
Look at my eyes!

341
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:52,914
You're all right.

342
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:55,713
Everything's all right.

343
00:39:56,324 --> 00:39:57,450
Trust me.

344
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:27,885
She's fine.

345
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:30,319
Some bumps and bruises,
but otherwise fine.

346
00:40:30,524 --> 00:40:33,015
She wants to see you.
Not you, Davidov. Him.

347
00:40:47,108 --> 00:40:48,473
Are you all right?

348
00:40:49,143 --> 00:40:51,043
I need to ask you something.

349
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:54,443
And I want you to tell me the truth.

350
00:40:54,649 --> 00:40:55,741
Who is it?

351
00:40:56,117 --> 00:40:57,812
Who's trying to kill me?

352
00:40:58,853 --> 00:41:00,650
I told you, I don't know.

353
00:41:01,522 --> 00:41:02,887
But I'm gonna find him.

354
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:05,052
Not good enough.

355
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:09,553
After the kidnapping, I was afraid.

356
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:13,032
I was afraid to go outside.
I was afraid to be alone.

357
00:41:13,234 --> 00:41:15,065
I was afraid to be in a crowd.

358
00:41:15,636 --> 00:41:17,661
I was afraid to do anything at all.

359
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:19,702
Until I realized...

360
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:22,232
...I can't hide in the shadows.

361
00:41:22,476 --> 00:41:24,501
I can't let fear run my life.

362
00:41:25,546 --> 00:41:26,604
I won't.

363
00:41:27,682 --> 00:41:29,513
After I find him...

364
00:41:30,751 --> 00:41:32,184
...you won't have to.

365
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:35,315
Don't go.

366
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:37,956
Stay with me.

367
00:41:40,194 --> 00:41:41,320
Please?

368
00:41:46,033 --> 00:41:47,432
I can't do that.

369
00:41:48,502 --> 00:41:51,027
I thought it was your job to protect me.

370
00:41:53,374 --> 00:41:54,432
You'll be safe here.

371
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:56,838
I don't want to be safe.

372
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:05,642
I'll be back soon.

373
00:42:07,822 --> 00:42:10,313
And who's afraid now, Mr. Bond?

374
00:43:22,263 --> 00:43:24,595
I want to see Valentin Zukovsky.

375
00:43:24,899 --> 00:43:26,230
Impossible.

376
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:28,900
Vodka martini.

377
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:30,994
Shaken, not stirred.

378
00:43:33,073 --> 00:43:35,098
Tell him James Bond is here.

379
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,670
Now.

380
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:45,510
I don't think you heard me.

381
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:57,758
Mr. Zukovsky would be delighted to see you.

382
00:44:02,703 --> 00:44:03,567
After you.

383
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:06,765
After you.

384
00:44:07,808 --> 00:44:08,740
I insist.

385
00:44:12,012 --> 00:44:13,604
And a little for you.

386
00:44:16,884 --> 00:44:18,681
Bond! James Bond!

387
00:44:19,386 --> 00:44:20,683
Meet Nina.

388
00:44:21,188 --> 00:44:22,621
And Verushka.

389
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:25,822
Lose the girls, Valentin.

390
00:44:26,026 --> 00:44:27,220
We need to talk.

391
00:44:27,728 --> 00:44:32,097
Why am I suddenly worried that
I'm not carrying enough insurance?

392
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:33,698
Chill out, James.

393
00:44:38,172 --> 00:44:39,104
Fine, ladies.

394
00:44:39,306 --> 00:44:40,603
Go on. Beat it. Scram.

395
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:42,742
Bull, give them an inch.

396
00:44:49,884 --> 00:44:52,785
And make sure they lose it in this casino.

397
00:44:54,955 --> 00:44:56,855
I'll see you later, Mr. Bond.

398
00:44:57,057 --> 00:44:59,321
I see you put your money
where your mouth is.

399
00:45:00,127 --> 00:45:02,391
Mr. Bullion does not trust banks.

400
00:45:02,596 --> 00:45:04,757
So what would you like to talk about?

401
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:06,990
I'm not sure I can really help you.

402
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:09,226
I'm a legitimate businessman now.

403
00:45:10,971 --> 00:45:14,737
Would you care for some caviar?
My own brand: Zukovsky's Finest.

404
00:45:16,043 --> 00:45:17,010
Look at this.

405
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,205
Russian Special Services.

406
00:45:23,484 --> 00:45:25,918
Atomic Energy Antiterrorist Unit.

407
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,610
Where did you find this?

408
00:45:27,821 --> 00:45:31,587
I took it off a Parahawk which tried
to kill Elektra King this morning.

409
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:34,254
Renard is behind this.

410
00:45:39,533 --> 00:45:42,127
I think you and I had better have a drink.

411
00:45:48,175 --> 00:45:50,735
And then after Afghanistan,
the KGB decided...

412
00:45:50,945 --> 00:45:54,108
...Renard was a liability and just cut him loose.

413
00:45:54,315 --> 00:45:56,078
Now he works freelance.

414
00:45:56,283 --> 00:45:57,841
But for whom?

415
00:45:58,919 --> 00:46:00,853
There are four competing pipelines.

416
00:46:01,055 --> 00:46:04,320
I'm willing to bet
half the customers in this casino would be...

417
00:46:04,525 --> 00:46:07,289
...very happy to see the King pipeline disappear.

418
00:46:09,096 --> 00:46:11,257
-What's funny?
-Nothing. It appears...

419
00:46:11,465 --> 00:46:14,263
...Miss King does not share your concern.

420
00:46:21,942 --> 00:46:23,569
What are you doing here?

421
00:46:23,911 --> 00:46:25,640
The same thing you are.

422
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:28,246
Looking for the people who tried to kill me.

423
00:46:28,449 --> 00:46:30,576
Let me take you home. Now.

424
00:46:30,784 --> 00:46:33,719
No. I want them to see I'm not frightened.

425
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:36,685
Miss King, how very nice to see you.

426
00:46:37,124 --> 00:46:39,024
We've kept your father's chair free.

427
00:46:39,226 --> 00:46:41,717
Free? Nothing comes free from you.

428
00:46:43,197 --> 00:46:46,689
Your father had a credit line with us.
One million U.S.

429
00:46:47,034 --> 00:46:49,559
I'd be happy to extend you that courtesy.

430
00:46:53,707 --> 00:46:54,969
So what's it to be?

431
00:46:57,144 --> 00:46:59,203
Blackjack, your father's favorite?

432
00:47:00,047 --> 00:47:01,639
Let's keep it simple.

433
00:47:02,649 --> 00:47:03,980
One card.

434
00:47:04,184 --> 00:47:05,378
High draw.

435
00:47:08,989 --> 00:47:09,887
A million dollars.

436
00:47:14,261 --> 00:47:15,193
Wait.

437
00:47:16,096 --> 00:47:18,155
Bury the top three cards.

438
00:47:20,367 --> 00:47:22,460
You're determined to protect me.

439
00:47:22,703 --> 00:47:24,671
From yourself. You don't have to do this.

440
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:31,102
There's no point in living if you can't feel alive.

441
00:47:43,357 --> 00:47:44,255
Queen of hearts.

442
00:47:57,538 --> 00:47:59,096
It appears you've been beaten...

443
00:48:00,774 --> 00:48:02,537
...by the ace of clubs.

444
00:48:06,713 --> 00:48:08,203
No hard feelings, my dear.

445
00:48:08,415 --> 00:48:09,939
Come again soon.

446
00:48:15,856 --> 00:48:17,118
Shall we?

447
00:48:21,061 --> 00:48:23,495
This is a game I can't afford to play.

448
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:26,926
I know.

449
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:33,571
-What happened to Davidov?
-I gave him the night off.

450
00:48:55,629 --> 00:48:57,597
Welcome to the Devil's Breath.

451
00:48:59,433 --> 00:49:02,766
For thousands of years,
Hindu pilgrims journeyed to this holy place...

452
00:49:04,705 --> 00:49:08,266
...to witness the wonder of
the natural flames that never die...

453
00:49:09,543 --> 00:49:11,568
...and to test their devotion...

454
00:49:12,646 --> 00:49:13,670
...to God...

455
00:49:15,182 --> 00:49:18,174
...by holding the scalding rocks in their hands...

456
00:49:21,188 --> 00:49:22,883
...as they said their prayers.

457
00:49:24,992 --> 00:49:26,118
Tell me, Davidov...

458
00:49:27,027 --> 00:49:28,756
...what happened this afternoon?

459
00:49:28,962 --> 00:49:30,793
You promised me your best men.

460
00:49:30,998 --> 00:49:33,057
Mr. Arkov supplied the latest weapons.

461
00:49:33,267 --> 00:49:34,757
Yes, but Bond--

462
00:49:34,968 --> 00:49:36,492
Bond was unarmed.

463
00:49:38,672 --> 00:49:42,199
And you, Arkov?
Is everything ready for tomorrow?

464
00:49:42,442 --> 00:49:45,002
I have the authorization and passes in the car.

465
00:49:45,212 --> 00:49:47,737
I have arranged for a plane tonight, but....

466
00:49:48,282 --> 00:49:49,340
But what?

467
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:52,383
We should scrub the rest of the mission.

468
00:49:52,586 --> 00:49:55,612
The Parahawks were meant to be returned.

469
00:49:55,822 --> 00:49:57,949
People will ask questions, even of me.

470
00:49:58,158 --> 00:50:00,524
All because of his incompetence.

471
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:01,625
I see.

472
00:50:01,828 --> 00:50:04,262
I see you're right.
He should be punished.

473
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:07,564
Davidov, hold this for me.

474
00:50:11,672 --> 00:50:14,402
It was wrong of me
to expect so much of you.

475
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:17,470
Kill him.

476
00:50:19,713 --> 00:50:21,908
He failed his test of devotion.

477
00:50:25,485 --> 00:50:27,146
You can take his place.

478
00:50:27,487 --> 00:50:28,977
Take his I.D.

479
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:32,518
And do be on time.

480
00:50:52,446 --> 00:50:53,879
Poor shoulder.

481
00:50:55,249 --> 00:50:56,614
It looks painful.

482
00:50:59,486 --> 00:51:01,511
It needs constant attention.

483
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:06,617
I knew....

484
00:51:07,294 --> 00:51:09,319
I knew when I first saw you.

485
00:51:10,397 --> 00:51:12,456
I knew it would be like this.

486
00:51:25,112 --> 00:51:26,909
Enough ice for one day.

487
00:51:47,034 --> 00:51:48,797
How did you survive?

488
00:51:56,376 --> 00:51:58,173
I seduced the guards.

489
00:51:58,412 --> 00:51:59,344
Used my body.

490
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:02,342
It gave me control.

491
00:52:04,384 --> 00:52:07,581
And the rest,
I got a gun and started shooting.

492
00:52:11,124 --> 00:52:12,557
And what about you?

493
00:52:12,759 --> 00:52:14,624
What do you do to survive?

494
00:52:18,932 --> 00:52:20,399
I take pleasure...

495
00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:24,059
...in great beauty.

496
00:55:03,296 --> 00:55:05,264
Let's go. It's getting late.

497
00:55:10,837 --> 00:55:12,498
What happened to Davidov?

498
00:55:12,739 --> 00:55:14,536
I was told to expect him.

499
00:55:15,775 --> 00:55:17,743
He was buried with work.

500
00:55:19,145 --> 00:55:21,113
Let's go. Get your stuff.

501
00:55:32,993 --> 00:55:34,324
Okay, come on.

502
00:55:34,528 --> 00:55:36,086
Let's get out of here.

503
00:55:38,198 --> 00:55:39,187
You're late.

504
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:40,966
Did you bring it?

505
00:55:41,468 --> 00:55:42,435
The grease.

506
00:55:45,939 --> 00:55:46,906
Of course.

507
00:55:54,614 --> 00:55:55,512
Excellent.

508
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,426
Get ready. We're 10 minutes out.

509
00:56:15,936 --> 00:56:17,904
But make sure you wear the I.D.

510
00:57:04,217 --> 00:57:05,980
I'm gonna go get some air.

511
00:57:23,737 --> 00:57:27,673
Welcome to Kazakhstan, Dr. Arkov.
I'm a great admirer of your research.

512
00:57:28,108 --> 00:57:31,043
It's not often we see
someone of your stature here.

513
00:57:31,244 --> 00:57:33,109
I go where the work takes me.

514
00:57:34,014 --> 00:57:36,505
By the way,
you have the transport documents?

515
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:48,226
I pulled the plutonium
out of the one inside.

516
00:57:48,428 --> 00:57:50,396
You can detonate the triggers now.

517
00:57:54,401 --> 00:57:56,869
<i>Look, our IDA physicist.</i>

518
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:59,270
<i>Don't bother. Not interested in men.</i>

519
00:57:59,973 --> 00:58:00,905
Take my word for it.

520
00:58:01,841 --> 00:58:05,402
This year we decommissioned
four test sites. Not even a glimmer.

521
00:58:10,216 --> 00:58:11,683
Are you here for a reason?

522
00:58:11,885 --> 00:58:14,285
Or are you just hoping for a glimmer?

523
00:58:14,721 --> 00:58:15,585
And you are...?

524
00:58:15,989 --> 00:58:19,015
Mikhail Arkov.
Russian Atomic Energy Department.

525
00:58:19,826 --> 00:58:20,724
Miss...?

526
00:58:21,361 --> 00:58:22,555
Doctor...

527
00:58:22,762 --> 00:58:24,491
...Jones. Christmas Jones.

528
00:58:24,698 --> 00:58:27,189
And don't make any jokes.
I've heard them all.

529
00:58:28,001 --> 00:58:29,901
I don't know any doctor jokes.

530
00:58:32,472 --> 00:58:34,770
This is okay.
Take the elevator down the hole.

531
00:58:34,974 --> 00:58:36,942
Your friends are already down there.

532
00:58:37,477 --> 00:58:39,240
Don't I get some protection?

533
00:58:39,946 --> 00:58:41,607
No, Dr. Arkov.

534
00:58:41,815 --> 00:58:44,682
Down there it's weapons-grade plutonium.
Reasonably safe.

535
00:58:45,118 --> 00:58:47,848
Up here we have leaking hydrogen bombs
that your lab built...

536
00:58:48,054 --> 00:58:50,716
...which I've spent the last six months cleaning up.

537
00:58:50,924 --> 00:58:53,757
So if you need any protection at all,
it's from me.

538
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:58,124
Your friends are waiting for you.

539
00:59:04,137 --> 00:59:04,967
Doctor.

540
00:59:07,674 --> 00:59:09,232
Aren't you forgetting?

541
00:59:12,979 --> 00:59:14,241
Of course. Thank you.

542
00:59:15,014 --> 00:59:16,174
By the way....

543
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:36,449
Expecting Davidov?

544
01:00:37,052 --> 01:00:39,953
He caught a bullet instead of the plane.

545
01:00:40,156 --> 01:00:40,986
Get off.

546
01:00:41,257 --> 01:00:42,724
Keep your mouth shut.

547
01:00:43,793 --> 01:00:45,988
You can't kill me. I'm already dead.

548
01:00:47,363 --> 01:00:49,194
Not dead enough for me.

549
01:00:49,698 --> 01:00:51,325
Show a little gratitude.

550
01:00:51,634 --> 01:00:54,000
I did spare your life at the banker's office.

551
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:55,998
That's right.

552
01:00:56,539 --> 01:00:59,064
I couldn't kill you.
You were working for me.

553
01:00:59,809 --> 01:01:01,367
You delivered the money, killed King.

554
01:01:02,077 --> 01:01:03,567
Now you brought me the plane.

555
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,970
What's your plan for the bomb?

556
01:01:06,816 --> 01:01:09,216
You first.
Or could it be you don't have a plan?

557
01:01:10,553 --> 01:01:12,817
That bomb will never leave this room.

558
01:01:13,789 --> 01:01:14,813
Neither will you.

559
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:23,298
How sad to be threatened by a man...

560
01:01:23,499 --> 01:01:25,524
...who can't grasp what he's involved in.

561
01:01:26,035 --> 01:01:29,061
Revenge is not hard to fathom
for a man who believes in nothing.

562
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:30,795
And what do you believe in?

563
01:01:31,006 --> 01:01:32,473
Preservation of capital?

564
01:01:32,675 --> 01:01:34,404
Go ahead, shoot me.

565
01:01:34,844 --> 01:01:36,175
I welcome it.

566
01:01:36,445 --> 01:01:38,913
My men will hear the shot and kill you.

567
01:01:39,114 --> 01:01:42,208
And the firefight will bring down
half the army from above.

568
01:01:42,418 --> 01:01:45,410
But when a certain phone call
isn't made in 20 minutes...

569
01:01:45,754 --> 01:01:46,914
...Elektra dies.

570
01:01:49,792 --> 01:01:50,759
You're bluffing.

571
01:01:52,027 --> 01:01:53,961
She's beautiful, isn't she?

572
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:56,230
You should have had her before...

573
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,528
...when she was innocent.

574
01:01:58,934 --> 01:01:59,866
How does it feel...

575
01:02:00,803 --> 01:02:02,862
...to know I broke her in for you?

576
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:07,431
I usually hate killing an unarmed man.

577
01:02:07,643 --> 01:02:09,406
Cold-blooded murder is a filthy business.

578
01:02:09,612 --> 01:02:11,944
A man tires of being executed.

579
01:02:13,015 --> 01:02:15,245
But in your case, I feel nothing...

580
01:02:15,618 --> 01:02:16,642
...just like you.

581
01:02:16,852 --> 01:02:20,583
But then again, there's no point living
if you can't feel alive.

582
01:02:25,928 --> 01:02:28,089
-Drop the gun!
-Keep away, colonel.

583
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:31,094
He's an impostor.
Dr. Arkov is 63 years old.

584
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,733
This is your impostor.

585
01:02:32,968 --> 01:02:35,266
Along with the men outside on the plane.

586
01:02:35,471 --> 01:02:36,495
They'll steal the bomb.

587
01:02:38,707 --> 01:02:40,299
I said drop it!

588
01:02:51,186 --> 01:02:52,278
On your knees!

589
01:02:55,424 --> 01:02:56,220
Well done.

590
01:02:58,794 --> 01:03:00,261
He would've killed us all.

591
01:03:01,096 --> 01:03:02,290
Did you speak to him?

592
01:03:02,531 --> 01:03:05,091
Yeah, but he's no atomic scientist.

593
01:03:06,569 --> 01:03:09,094
I suppose you were the one
who allowed him down.

594
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,538
You had me...

595
01:03:21,216 --> 01:03:22,740
...but I knew you couldn't...

596
01:03:22,952 --> 01:03:25,079
...shoulder the responsibility.

597
01:03:31,527 --> 01:03:33,757
Without any interruptions, let's proceed.

598
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:37,424
Too many new faces are here,
including yours.

599
01:03:39,234 --> 01:03:42,499
The bomb doesn't move
until I am satisfied.

600
01:03:43,172 --> 01:03:45,333
All of you, to the surface, now.

601
01:04:07,763 --> 01:04:08,661
Come on! Go!

602
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,667
Move!

603
01:04:19,742 --> 01:04:21,073
They're sealing us in.

604
01:04:23,612 --> 01:04:24,772
Who are you?

605
01:04:25,881 --> 01:04:27,746
I work for the British government.

606
01:04:32,621 --> 01:04:33,485
Stay calm.

607
01:06:37,479 --> 01:06:39,777
No hard feelings, Mr. Bond...

608
01:06:39,982 --> 01:06:41,313
...but we're even.

609
01:06:41,517 --> 01:06:42,745
Soon...

610
01:06:43,252 --> 01:06:45,243
...you'll feel nothing at all.

611
01:07:11,146 --> 01:07:13,444
Seal the door! Close it!

612
01:07:26,228 --> 01:07:27,195
Come on!

613
01:07:48,383 --> 01:07:50,510
Keep going! Move! Hang on!

614
01:07:51,353 --> 01:07:53,412
You're a British spy.
Do you have a name?

615
01:07:53,622 --> 01:07:54,782
The name's Bond.

616
01:08:00,229 --> 01:08:01,526
James Bond.

617
01:08:11,874 --> 01:08:14,001
Don't stop! Go, go! Jump!

618
01:08:35,097 --> 01:08:36,587
They won't get very far.

619
01:08:36,832 --> 01:08:38,493
Every warhead has a locator card.

620
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,531
We can track the signal.

621
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:43,631
You mean one of these?

622
01:08:51,313 --> 01:08:53,406
Do we have the range of Renard's plane?

623
01:08:53,615 --> 01:08:56,413
Anywhere in this circle: Russia...

624
01:08:56,618 --> 01:08:58,950
...Armenia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan--

625
01:08:59,154 --> 01:09:01,645
Sorry to interrupt.
Elektra is calling from Baku.

626
01:09:01,857 --> 01:09:03,085
It's on the video line.

627
01:09:03,325 --> 01:09:05,225
Put her on the wall screen.

628
01:09:09,598 --> 01:09:12,726
I'm sorry.
I would never call you except...

629
01:09:12,935 --> 01:09:14,232
...James has disappeared.

630
01:09:15,037 --> 01:09:18,097
He left my villa in the middle of the night...

631
01:09:19,474 --> 01:09:22,773
...and my head of security has been found...

632
01:09:22,978 --> 01:09:25,742
...near a local airstrip, murdered.

633
01:09:26,715 --> 01:09:28,307
I'll send someone out.

634
01:09:29,117 --> 01:09:30,209
M, could you come?

635
01:09:31,453 --> 01:09:33,284
I can't help thinking...

636
01:09:34,022 --> 01:09:35,353
...I'm next.

637
01:09:39,695 --> 01:09:40,787
Get me out there.

638
01:09:41,029 --> 01:09:43,327
Just get me out there.

639
01:10:01,683 --> 01:10:02,809
Gabor?

640
01:10:14,563 --> 01:10:15,723
Surprised?

641
01:10:16,231 --> 01:10:18,392
What's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

642
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,624
Maybe.

643
01:10:20,335 --> 01:10:21,427
Maybe I should ask you.

644
01:10:22,337 --> 01:10:23,167
After all...

645
01:10:23,972 --> 01:10:26,440
...''There's no point in living
if you can't feel alive.''

646
01:10:26,641 --> 01:10:29,303
Isn't that right, Elektra?
Isn't that your motto?

647
01:10:29,711 --> 01:10:30,541
What do you mean?

648
01:10:30,746 --> 01:10:33,579
Or did you steal it
from your old friend Renard?

649
01:10:34,349 --> 01:10:37,910
He and I had a chat.
Knew all about us. Knew about my shoulder.

650
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,678
Knew exactly where to hurt me.

651
01:10:39,888 --> 01:10:42,152
Renard's the man who's trying to kill me?

652
01:10:42,357 --> 01:10:43,449
Drop the act.

653
01:10:45,093 --> 01:10:46,082
It's over.

654
01:10:47,696 --> 01:10:48,890
I don't know what you mean.

655
01:10:49,197 --> 01:10:50,664
Oh, I think you do.

656
01:10:52,901 --> 01:10:54,994
It's called Stockholm syndrome.

657
01:10:56,204 --> 01:10:58,069
Common in kidnappings.

658
01:10:58,573 --> 01:11:00,700
Young, impressionable victim.

659
01:11:01,276 --> 01:11:02,538
Sheltered.

660
01:11:03,979 --> 01:11:06,470
Sexually inexperienced.

661
01:11:07,015 --> 01:11:10,849
A powerful kidnapper skilled
in torture, manipulation.

662
01:11:12,354 --> 01:11:14,686
Something snaps in the victim's mind.

663
01:11:15,323 --> 01:11:17,188
The captive falls in love with her captor.

664
01:11:17,826 --> 01:11:18,622
How dare you?

665
01:11:19,895 --> 01:11:20,827
How dare you?

666
01:11:21,229 --> 01:11:23,026
That animal. That monster?

667
01:11:23,565 --> 01:11:25,396
He disgusts me.

668
01:11:26,401 --> 01:11:28,096
You disgust me.

669
01:11:29,004 --> 01:11:31,871
So he knew where to hurt you,
is that it?

670
01:11:32,174 --> 01:11:34,540
You had a sling on your arm at the funeral.

671
01:11:35,177 --> 01:11:37,873
And I didn't have to
sleep with you to find that out.

672
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,411
He used your exact words.

673
01:11:39,614 --> 01:11:40,945
So you knew.

674
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:44,576
You knew all the time
he was out there, coming for me...

675
01:11:44,786 --> 01:11:45,753
...and you lied.

676
01:11:46,822 --> 01:11:48,255
You used me.

677
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:50,790
You used me as bait.

678
01:11:54,296 --> 01:11:56,025
And you made love to me.

679
01:11:57,933 --> 01:11:58,865
What?

680
01:11:59,768 --> 01:12:03,135
To pass the time
as you waited for him to strike?

681
01:12:15,517 --> 01:12:18,918
He's struck again.
Ten men are dead at the pipeline.

682
01:12:19,121 --> 01:12:19,985
I'm coming with you.

683
01:12:21,523 --> 01:12:24,253
You do what you want to do,
but I've called M.

684
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,551
She's coming to take charge.

685
01:12:57,325 --> 01:12:59,725
I want an update.
Where do we stand?

686
01:13:00,662 --> 01:13:03,756
One of Renard's men took
the locator card from the bomb...

687
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,432
...so we can't track it. But....

688
01:13:05,634 --> 01:13:06,862
But what?

689
01:13:07,536 --> 01:13:08,901
With all due respect...

690
01:13:09,804 --> 01:13:11,635
...I don't think you should be here.

691
01:13:12,774 --> 01:13:16,107
May I remind you that
you're the reason I'm here, 007.

692
01:13:16,444 --> 01:13:18,878
You disobeyed an order
and left that girl alone.

693
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,981
Perhaps that girl isn't as innocent as you think.

694
01:13:22,184 --> 01:13:24,846
-What are you saying?
-Suppose the inside man...

695
01:13:25,053 --> 01:13:26,884
...the one who switched King's lapel pin...

696
01:13:27,923 --> 01:13:29,686
...turned out to be an inside woman?

697
01:13:32,594 --> 01:13:35,529
She kills her father
and attacks her own pipeline?

698
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:38,130
-Why? To what end?
-I don't know...yet.

699
01:13:46,007 --> 01:13:47,201
Look at that.

700
01:13:47,409 --> 01:13:48,341
That's not right.

701
01:13:49,878 --> 01:13:50,708
What is it?

702
01:13:50,912 --> 01:13:52,504
An observation rig.

703
01:13:52,714 --> 01:13:54,773
Travels in the pipe looking for cracks.

704
01:13:54,983 --> 01:13:56,314
Shut it down.

705
01:13:58,987 --> 01:13:59,885
I don't understand.

706
01:14:00,088 --> 01:14:01,680
It won't respond.

707
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:03,987
The place is clean. No sign of--

708
01:14:04,226 --> 01:14:06,694
-The bomb is in the pipeline.
-Oh, my God!

709
01:14:06,928 --> 01:14:09,726
They brought it through here.
That'd explain the attack.

710
01:14:09,931 --> 01:14:11,398
Heading for the oil terminal.

711
01:14:11,566 --> 01:14:13,431
Where it would do the most damage.

712
01:14:13,635 --> 01:14:15,626
Have your men evacuate that terminal.

713
01:14:17,539 --> 01:14:18,938
So now do you believe me?

714
01:14:21,676 --> 01:14:24,042
This is an emergency situation.
So please...

715
01:14:24,512 --> 01:14:26,343
...clear the room. Do it.

716
01:14:26,548 --> 01:14:27,879
He's going for the oil.

717
01:14:28,783 --> 01:14:32,879
The one pipeline the West is
counting on to supply our reserves.

718
01:14:33,989 --> 01:14:35,251
Do you have an idea?

719
01:14:35,457 --> 01:14:36,515
Maybe.

720
01:14:37,626 --> 01:14:40,652
How far is the rig from the terminal?
How fast is it traveling?

721
01:14:41,196 --> 01:14:45,599
It's 106 miles from the terminal,
going 70 miles an hour.

722
01:14:45,867 --> 01:14:47,835
We have 78 minutes.
Is there another rig?

723
01:14:48,036 --> 01:14:50,732
There's one parked
in the passageway ahead of it.

724
01:14:51,006 --> 01:14:53,736
-Charles, can you get me out there?
-Of course.

725
01:14:54,909 --> 01:14:57,605
Wait a minute. Are you gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

726
01:14:57,812 --> 01:15:01,009
-What do I need to defuse a bomb?
-Me.

727
01:15:13,762 --> 01:15:14,592
There it is.

728
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:17,027
Hatch to the passageway.

729
01:15:21,503 --> 01:15:24,666
You keep the speed up
so the other rig catches up with us.

730
01:15:24,873 --> 01:15:26,500
-I'll wait to hear from you.
-Gotcha.

731
01:15:27,809 --> 01:15:29,436
You know how to drive this thing?

732
01:15:29,644 --> 01:15:32,772
Doesn't exactly take a degree
in nuclear physics.

733
01:15:41,156 --> 01:15:42,646
They're in the pipeline.

734
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:44,781
They're on the move.

735
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:02,236
Faster!

736
01:16:10,085 --> 01:16:12,576
If there's the slightest chance,
Bond will succeed.

737
01:16:13,388 --> 01:16:14,946
He's the best we have...

738
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:17,117
...though I'd never tell him.

739
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,155
I hope you're right.

740
01:16:23,732 --> 01:16:25,063
Here it comes!

741
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:31,331
It's closing up. Faster!

742
01:16:36,978 --> 01:16:38,468
Sit tight.

743
01:16:53,895 --> 01:16:55,886
No brakes! The controls are jammed!

744
01:17:10,345 --> 01:17:12,313
It's a tactical fission device.

745
01:17:12,514 --> 01:17:14,539
Low yield. Hold me steady.

746
01:17:15,316 --> 01:17:17,284
You've defused hundreds of these, right?

747
01:17:17,485 --> 01:17:20,010
Yeah, but they're usually standing still.

748
01:17:21,256 --> 01:17:23,690
Life's full of small challenges.

749
01:17:24,893 --> 01:17:25,860
Have a look at this.

750
01:17:26,227 --> 01:17:27,694
Someone stripped the screw heads.

751
01:17:29,597 --> 01:17:31,758
Someone's tampered with the bomb.

752
01:17:51,786 --> 01:17:54,448
Look, half the plutonium's missing.

753
01:17:55,256 --> 01:17:57,850
So what are you saying?
It couldn't go nuclear?

754
01:17:58,092 --> 01:18:01,858
There's still enough explosive
to kill us both if the trigger goes off.

755
01:18:02,297 --> 01:18:03,992
-Let it blow.
-But I can stop it.

756
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:05,188
Let it blow!

757
01:18:11,539 --> 01:18:12,631
Trust me. Leave it.

758
01:18:16,778 --> 01:18:18,541
Move down. Move down!

759
01:18:18,813 --> 01:18:19,973
Jump! Go on, jump!

760
01:18:23,218 --> 01:18:24,048
Jump!

761
01:18:38,867 --> 01:18:40,528
Robinson's reporting.

762
01:18:41,035 --> 01:18:43,003
The bomb was a dud.

763
01:18:44,038 --> 01:18:47,439
But the triggering charge blew out
a 50-yard section of the pipe.

764
01:18:47,642 --> 01:18:48,734
And Bond?

765
01:18:49,811 --> 01:18:50,800
Nothing.

766
01:18:52,647 --> 01:18:54,171
I'm so sorry.

767
01:18:57,085 --> 01:18:58,814
But I have a gift for you.

768
01:18:59,621 --> 01:19:01,748
Something that belonged to my father.

769
01:19:02,357 --> 01:19:04,086
He would've wanted you to have it.

770
01:19:05,226 --> 01:19:06,523
Perhaps this isn't the time.

771
01:19:07,529 --> 01:19:08,689
Please.

772
01:19:09,998 --> 01:19:13,161
He often spoke of how compassionately...

773
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:17,631
...you advised him on the best course
of action during my kidnapping.

774
01:19:21,409 --> 01:19:23,070
It's very valuable, you know.

775
01:19:23,912 --> 01:19:26,472
I couldn't let it explode
with the rest of him.

776
01:19:31,819 --> 01:19:35,016
I was very upset
when the money didn't kill both of you.

777
01:19:35,757 --> 01:19:38,089
I didn't think I'd get another chance.

778
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,157
Then you dropped the answer right in my lap.

779
01:19:42,797 --> 01:19:43,729
Bond.

780
01:19:44,299 --> 01:19:47,132
And as you say,
he's the best you have.

781
01:19:47,335 --> 01:19:49,360
Or should I say, ''had''?

782
01:19:55,743 --> 01:19:57,267
Take her to the helicopter.

783
01:20:04,152 --> 01:20:05,483
Come on, give me your hand.

784
01:20:05,687 --> 01:20:06,881
Jump, jump!

785
01:20:08,356 --> 01:20:10,290
Do you wanna explain why you did that?

786
01:20:10,525 --> 01:20:13,016
I could've stopped it.
You almost killed us.

787
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:14,660
I did kill us.

788
01:20:15,296 --> 01:20:18,561
She thinks we're dead,
and she thinks she got away with it.

789
01:20:18,766 --> 01:20:22,202
Do you wanna put that in English
for those of us who don't speak ''spy''?

790
01:20:22,403 --> 01:20:23,495
Who's ''she''?

791
01:20:23,705 --> 01:20:24,865
Elektra King.

792
01:20:25,073 --> 01:20:27,200
Why would she blow up her own pipeline?

793
01:20:27,408 --> 01:20:28,898
It makes her look innocent.

794
01:20:30,745 --> 01:20:33,737
The explosion covers up
the theft of the plutonium.

795
01:20:35,249 --> 01:20:36,910
It looks like a terrorist attack.

796
01:20:37,118 --> 01:20:39,348
But why leave this half?

797
01:20:39,721 --> 01:20:43,350
So there's enough to spread around
to cover up what they did take.

798
01:20:43,558 --> 01:20:45,583
What will they do with the other half?

799
01:20:45,827 --> 01:20:48,261
It's not enough to make a nuclear bomb.

800
01:20:48,463 --> 01:20:51,227
-You're the scientist, you tell me.
-I don't know.

801
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:55,666
But the world's greatest terrorist
running around with 6 kilos...

802
01:20:55,870 --> 01:20:57,497
...of plutonium can't be good.

803
01:20:57,705 --> 01:21:00,173
I have to get it back,
or somebody will have my ass.

804
01:21:02,944 --> 01:21:04,343
First things first.

805
01:21:06,581 --> 01:21:08,515
Bond to Robinson. Do you copy?

806
01:21:08,716 --> 01:21:11,549
By the way, before we go any further...

807
01:21:11,919 --> 01:21:13,477
...I just wanna know....

808
01:21:14,322 --> 01:21:16,722
What's the story with you and Elektra?

809
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:19,586
We're strictly platonic. Now.

810
01:21:19,827 --> 01:21:22,022
Bond to Robinson. Copy?

811
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:25,798
What's your story?

812
01:21:26,367 --> 01:21:28,494
What are you doing here in Kazakhstan?

813
01:21:28,703 --> 01:21:31,763
Avoiding those kind of questions,
just like you.

814
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:34,900
<i>I read you, 007. Red alert.</i>

815
01:21:35,109 --> 01:21:37,168
<i>M is missing with Elektra.
Three men down.</i>

816
01:21:37,378 --> 01:21:39,278
<i>Await instructions. Out.</i>

817
01:21:40,948 --> 01:21:41,937
What do we do now?

818
01:21:46,454 --> 01:21:48,820
I may have overlooked one critical element.

819
01:21:49,123 --> 01:21:51,057
What? More plutonium?

820
01:21:51,959 --> 01:21:53,017
Beluga.

821
01:21:53,795 --> 01:21:55,160
Caviar.

822
01:22:24,826 --> 01:22:26,157
Brought me something?

823
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,464
The power to reshape the world.

824
01:22:37,939 --> 01:22:38,928
Go on.

825
01:22:39,674 --> 01:22:40,698
It's safe.

826
01:22:42,243 --> 01:22:43,870
Touch your destiny.

827
01:22:57,525 --> 01:23:00,050
I have brought something for you as well.

828
01:23:06,534 --> 01:23:08,229
Your present.

829
01:23:08,503 --> 01:23:11,063
Courtesy of the late Mr. Bond.

830
01:23:11,806 --> 01:23:13,034
My executioner.

831
01:23:13,441 --> 01:23:15,375
Overpraise, I'm afraid.

832
01:23:15,843 --> 01:23:18,744
-But my people will finish the job.
-Your people?

833
01:23:19,313 --> 01:23:22,248
Your people will leave you here to rot...

834
01:23:23,017 --> 01:23:25,076
...just like you left me.

835
01:23:25,653 --> 01:23:26,950
You and my father.

836
01:23:27,155 --> 01:23:29,214
-Your father--
-My father was nothing.

837
01:23:29,857 --> 01:23:32,348
His kingdom he stole from my mother.

838
01:23:33,461 --> 01:23:36,362
The kingdom I will rightly take back.

839
01:23:45,139 --> 01:23:47,607
I hope you're proud
of what you did to her.

840
01:23:48,876 --> 01:23:51,344
I'm afraid it is you who deserve credit.

841
01:23:53,014 --> 01:23:54,413
When I took her...

842
01:23:54,949 --> 01:23:56,940
...she was promise itself.

843
01:23:57,618 --> 01:24:00,212
You left her at the mercy of a man like me.

844
01:24:01,389 --> 01:24:03,016
You ruined her.

845
01:24:03,758 --> 01:24:04,554
For what?

846
01:24:05,059 --> 01:24:06,390
To get to me?

847
01:24:06,994 --> 01:24:08,586
She's worth 50 of me.

848
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:10,764
For once, I agree with you.

849
01:24:14,669 --> 01:24:17,194
And now we also share a common fate.

850
01:24:17,972 --> 01:24:18,802
You will die...

851
01:24:19,507 --> 01:24:21,532
...along with everyone in this city...

852
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:27,171
...and the bright, starry,
oil-driven future of the West.

853
01:24:33,688 --> 01:24:35,918
Since you sent your man to kill me...

854
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:38,749
...I've been watching time tick slowly away...

855
01:24:39,827 --> 01:24:41,920
...marching toward my own death.

856
01:24:45,566 --> 01:24:47,659
Now you can have the same pleasure.

857
01:24:51,806 --> 01:24:53,535
Watch these hands, M.

858
01:24:54,609 --> 01:24:56,304
By noon tomorrow...

859
01:24:57,011 --> 01:24:58,273
...your time is up.

860
01:25:00,014 --> 01:25:01,709
And I guarantee you...

861
01:25:02,116 --> 01:25:03,743
...I will not miss.

862
01:25:26,407 --> 01:25:27,931
So beautiful.

863
01:25:29,543 --> 01:25:30,942
So smooth.

864
01:25:32,346 --> 01:25:33,779
So warm.

865
01:25:34,715 --> 01:25:36,205
How would you know?

866
01:25:41,555 --> 01:25:42,988
Why are you like this?

867
01:25:44,358 --> 01:25:46,155
Because Bond is dead?

868
01:25:47,495 --> 01:25:49,019
It's what you wanted.

869
01:25:50,231 --> 01:25:52,165
Of course it's what I wanted.

870
01:25:57,305 --> 01:25:58,431
He was....

871
01:26:01,742 --> 01:26:03,039
He was a good lover?

872
01:26:03,911 --> 01:26:05,344
What do you think?

873
01:26:05,546 --> 01:26:07,537
I wouldn't feel anything?

874
01:26:22,163 --> 01:26:23,630
I feel nothing.

875
01:26:39,714 --> 01:26:41,306
What about this?

876
01:26:52,126 --> 01:26:53,593
But surely...

877
01:26:54,662 --> 01:26:57,756
...you can feel this?

878
01:27:04,605 --> 01:27:05,902
Remember...

879
01:27:08,776 --> 01:27:10,038
...pleasure?

880
01:27:57,625 --> 01:27:58,683
Wait here.

881
01:27:59,727 --> 01:28:00,955
Always something.

882
01:28:01,195 --> 01:28:02,355
First the casino.

883
01:28:02,596 --> 01:28:04,393
Now the caviar factory.

884
01:28:04,598 --> 01:28:07,158
I am a slave to the free-market economy.

885
01:28:23,784 --> 01:28:24,614
Bond is alive.

886
01:28:30,558 --> 01:28:32,856
Is nothing in this place straight?

887
01:28:37,865 --> 01:28:39,162
Who are you?

888
01:28:39,767 --> 01:28:41,132
And how did you get in?

889
01:28:41,769 --> 01:28:42,997
I'll call security...

890
01:28:43,804 --> 01:28:45,965
...and congratulate them.

891
01:28:46,307 --> 01:28:47,137
Drink?

892
01:28:50,578 --> 01:28:53,172
Can't you say hello like a normal person?

893
01:28:54,849 --> 01:28:56,180
Get lost.

894
01:28:56,951 --> 01:28:59,545
No, no, no. Down the back.

895
01:29:01,889 --> 01:29:03,550
What's your business with Elektra King?

896
01:29:04,458 --> 01:29:07,950
I thought you were the one
giving her the business.

897
01:29:08,162 --> 01:29:11,529
She drops $1 million in your casino,
and you don't even blink an eye.

898
01:29:11,765 --> 01:29:13,596
What's she paying you off for?

899
01:29:14,668 --> 01:29:18,126
You know, if I were you,
a relationship with a man like that...

900
01:29:18,772 --> 01:29:20,034
...I wouldn't bet on it.

901
01:29:24,044 --> 01:29:26,535
$5000 of beluga. Ruined.

902
01:29:26,747 --> 01:29:29,682
That's nothing compared to
what a nuclear bomb can do.

903
01:29:30,584 --> 01:29:32,779
We had a nuclear bomb stolen this morning.

904
01:29:32,987 --> 01:29:35,319
Renard and Elektra King
are working together.

905
01:29:35,523 --> 01:29:37,787
-I didn't know.
-Well, what do you know?

906
01:32:01,402 --> 01:32:02,994
Q's not gonna like this.

907
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:33,990
Get out!

908
01:34:46,133 --> 01:34:46,929
Help!

909
01:34:47,167 --> 01:34:48,065
Now...

910
01:34:49,036 --> 01:34:49,968
...where were we?

911
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:52,161
-A rope, please!
-No. The truth.

912
01:34:52,406 --> 01:34:53,373
She has M.

913
01:34:53,574 --> 01:34:56,737
-I know nothing.
-Those blades were meant for you.

914
01:34:56,944 --> 01:34:59,310
What does Elektra King want you dead for?

915
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:01,946
It was you who destroyed my factory.

916
01:35:02,149 --> 01:35:04,083
Then you drown my Rolls-Royce...

917
01:35:04,284 --> 01:35:07,776
...and now you're trying
to drown me in my own caviar!

918
01:35:07,988 --> 01:35:09,387
Let me out!

919
01:35:09,823 --> 01:35:12,986
Too bad we don't have any... champagne.

920
01:35:13,193 --> 01:35:14,455
Or sour cream.

921
01:35:17,364 --> 01:35:18,661
Occasionally...

922
01:35:19,333 --> 01:35:22,632
...I get equipment for her.
Machinery. Russian stuff.

923
01:35:23,504 --> 01:35:25,233
And the payoff in the casino?

924
01:35:25,739 --> 01:35:26,967
It was a special job.

925
01:35:27,774 --> 01:35:29,765
My nephew is in the navy.

926
01:35:30,844 --> 01:35:34,041
He's smuggling some machinery for her.

927
01:35:34,248 --> 01:35:36,079
-Where?
-Absolutely not!

928
01:35:36,283 --> 01:35:37,307
Where?

929
01:35:40,687 --> 01:35:42,848
-Where?
-Istanbul!

930
01:35:52,499 --> 01:35:53,295
You!

931
01:35:53,534 --> 01:35:55,900
Where have you been,
you gold-encrusted buffoon?

932
01:35:56,103 --> 01:35:58,833
Sorry, boss.
I must have bumped my head.

933
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:02,531
Get me out of here,
I'll show you what a bumped head feels like.

934
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:04,402
Look.

935
01:36:04,611 --> 01:36:08,047
We have no roof,
but at least we have four good walls.

936
01:36:20,027 --> 01:36:23,986
<i>The insurance company
is never going to believe this.</i>

937
01:37:25,359 --> 01:37:29,591
<i>This used to be the KGB's
Istanbul safe house. Now it's FSB.</i>

938
01:37:29,796 --> 01:37:31,559
Federal Security Bureau.

939
01:37:31,765 --> 01:37:34,393
Same old friendly service with a new name.

940
01:37:35,002 --> 01:37:36,902
-Did you raise Nikolai?
-Nothing.

941
01:37:37,104 --> 01:37:39,629
Try scanning the emergency frequencies.

942
01:37:41,375 --> 01:37:42,433
Tragedy.

943
01:37:42,943 --> 01:37:45,343
In the old days, there were 100 places...

944
01:37:45,545 --> 01:37:47,979
...where a submarine could surface undetected.

945
01:37:48,181 --> 01:37:49,011
Submarine?

946
01:37:49,983 --> 01:37:51,951
What class is your nephew running?

947
01:37:52,853 --> 01:37:55,014
Victor 3, you call it.

948
01:37:55,222 --> 01:37:58,680
Nuclear. He's not loading cargo.
They want the sub to use the reactor.

949
01:37:58,892 --> 01:37:59,722
That's it.

950
01:37:59,926 --> 01:38:02,861
Put weapons-grade plutonium
in that sub's reactor...

951
01:38:03,063 --> 01:38:05,429
...instant, catastrophic meltdown.

952
01:38:05,632 --> 01:38:08,396
Making it all look just like an accident.

953
01:38:08,635 --> 01:38:09,829
But why?

954
01:38:10,337 --> 01:38:13,773
Because the existing pipelines
from the Caspian Sea...

955
01:38:14,007 --> 01:38:16,532
...go to the north. Here.

956
01:38:16,743 --> 01:38:20,941
The oil is put on the tankers,
shipped across the Black Sea to Istanbul.

957
01:38:21,448 --> 01:38:23,780
The explosion would destroy Istanbul...

958
01:38:24,484 --> 01:38:27,112
...contaminating the Bosporus for decades.

959
01:38:27,854 --> 01:38:29,981
There'd be one way to get the oil out.

960
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:32,590
Down south to the Med.

961
01:38:32,793 --> 01:38:34,124
The King pipeline.

962
01:38:34,728 --> 01:38:35,820
Elektra's pipeline.

963
01:38:36,029 --> 01:38:37,792
We must find Nikolai.

964
01:38:39,633 --> 01:38:41,032
Captain Nikolai?

965
01:38:43,136 --> 01:38:44,034
Sir.

966
01:38:45,172 --> 01:38:46,696
Ready to load your cargo.

967
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:50,103
-We have only a few hours.
-You came with skeleton crew?

968
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:52,335
-That's all we can afford.
-Of course.

969
01:38:52,746 --> 01:38:55,044
Some brandy and
refreshments for your men.

970
01:38:57,050 --> 01:38:58,142
Thank you.

971
01:39:03,423 --> 01:39:04,355
Good morning.

972
01:39:09,196 --> 01:39:10,527
What's the time?

973
01:39:24,144 --> 01:39:26,078
It's time for you to die.

974
01:39:58,645 --> 01:40:00,078
I've got something.

975
01:40:01,014 --> 01:40:02,777
On the emergency frequency.

976
01:40:02,983 --> 01:40:05,577
Two six-digit numbers
cycled every 15 seconds.

977
01:40:05,786 --> 01:40:07,651
A GPS signal. Position coordinates.

978
01:40:07,854 --> 01:40:09,719
Locator card. M.

979
01:40:13,126 --> 01:40:14,593
-Here.
-Maiden's Tower.

980
01:40:15,095 --> 01:40:16,323
Have you been there?

981
01:40:16,797 --> 01:40:17,786
No.
Mr. Bullion!

982
01:40:21,968 --> 01:40:23,026
Bomb!

983
01:40:29,976 --> 01:40:31,409
Come on, come on.

984
01:40:45,225 --> 01:40:46,522
After you.

985
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:48,693
I insist.

986
01:41:05,645 --> 01:41:07,545
Enjoyed your meal, boys?

987
01:41:15,422 --> 01:41:17,549
Take them up and throw them in the sea.

988
01:41:29,836 --> 01:41:30,962
The extruder's in here.

989
01:41:32,873 --> 01:41:36,832
It'll take me half an hour to set up
the machine to make the plutonium rod.

990
01:41:43,683 --> 01:41:45,082
Put them in here.

991
01:41:54,661 --> 01:41:56,390
The reactor is secured.

992
01:41:56,630 --> 01:41:58,621
Everything is complete as planned.

993
01:42:01,034 --> 01:42:04,800
-Is your helicopter ready?
-It'll pick me up in half an hour.

994
01:42:08,308 --> 01:42:09,832
Then this is the end.

995
01:42:11,878 --> 01:42:13,436
This is the beginning.

996
01:42:14,514 --> 01:42:16,914
The world will never be the same.

997
01:42:29,896 --> 01:42:31,386
The future is yours.

998
01:42:33,233 --> 01:42:34,564
Have fun with it.

999
01:42:42,017 --> 01:42:43,517
James Bond.

1000
01:42:51,518 --> 01:42:52,746
If only you'd kept away...

1001
01:42:52,953 --> 01:42:56,354
...we might've met again in a few years
and become lovers once more.

1002
01:43:05,932 --> 01:43:06,864
Take her to Renard.

1003
01:43:10,236 --> 01:43:11,669
Pretty thing.

1004
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:14,129
You had her too?

1005
01:43:18,912 --> 01:43:20,777
I could've given you the world.

1006
01:43:22,248 --> 01:43:23,840
The world is not enough.

1007
01:43:24,751 --> 01:43:26,150
Foolish sentiment.

1008
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:28,344
Family motto.

1009
01:43:31,124 --> 01:43:35,493
They were digging near here,
and they found some very pretty vases.

1010
01:43:36,763 --> 01:43:38,890
They also found this chair.

1011
01:43:49,609 --> 01:43:52,544
I think we ignore the old ways at our peril...

1012
01:43:52,746 --> 01:43:54,008
...don't you?

1013
01:43:54,547 --> 01:43:55,775
Where's M?

1014
01:43:56,282 --> 01:43:58,147
Soon she'll be everywhere.

1015
01:43:59,786 --> 01:44:00,684
All this...

1016
01:44:02,455 --> 01:44:04,719
...because you fell for Renard?

1017
01:44:07,694 --> 01:44:10,663
Five more turns and your neck will break.

1018
01:44:14,334 --> 01:44:16,802
I've always had a power over men.

1019
01:44:18,838 --> 01:44:23,172
When I realized my father wouldn't
rescue me from the kidnappers...

1020
01:44:23,576 --> 01:44:26,238
...I knew I had to form another alliance.

1021
01:44:27,714 --> 01:44:28,806
You...

1022
01:44:29,816 --> 01:44:31,545
...turned Renard.

1023
01:44:32,819 --> 01:44:34,411
Just like you...

1024
01:44:34,654 --> 01:44:37,555
...only you were even easier.

1025
01:44:41,127 --> 01:44:42,788
I told him he had to hurt me.

1026
01:44:43,563 --> 01:44:45,656
He had to make it look real.

1027
01:44:46,499 --> 01:44:47,397
When he refused...

1028
01:44:48,868 --> 01:44:52,065
...I told him I would do it myself.

1029
01:44:57,677 --> 01:44:59,542
So you killed your father.

1030
01:45:00,513 --> 01:45:01,741
He killed me.

1031
01:45:03,583 --> 01:45:05,915
He killed me the day
he refused to pay my ransom.

1032
01:45:06,119 --> 01:45:08,383
Was this all about the oil?

1033
01:45:09,956 --> 01:45:11,753
It is my oil.

1034
01:45:12,592 --> 01:45:13,559
Mine...

1035
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,125
...and my family's.

1036
01:45:15,328 --> 01:45:18,456
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.

1037
01:45:19,733 --> 01:45:22,133
I'm going to redraw the map.

1038
01:45:22,369 --> 01:45:25,668
And when I'm through,
the whole world will know my name...

1039
01:45:25,872 --> 01:45:29,137
...my grandfather's name,
the glory of my people!

1040
01:45:29,342 --> 01:45:32,869
No one will believe
this meltdown was an accident.

1041
01:45:33,079 --> 01:45:34,808
They will all believe.

1042
01:45:36,316 --> 01:45:37,943
You understand?

1043
01:45:38,385 --> 01:45:40,285
Nobody can resist me.

1044
01:45:45,091 --> 01:45:48,117
You know what happens
when a man is strangled?

1045
01:45:50,263 --> 01:45:52,128
Elektra... it's not too late.

1046
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:56,230
Eight million people need not die.

1047
01:45:58,071 --> 01:46:00,733
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

1048
01:46:01,841 --> 01:46:03,502
But you couldn't. Not me.

1049
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:05,541
Not a woman you've loved.

1050
01:46:15,622 --> 01:46:18,113
You meant nothing to me.

1051
01:46:23,396 --> 01:46:24,226
One...

1052
01:46:25,665 --> 01:46:26,791
...last...

1053
01:46:28,802 --> 01:46:30,201
...screw.

1054
01:46:54,561 --> 01:46:55,391
Boss...

1055
01:46:56,463 --> 01:46:57,555
...you're alive.

1056
01:46:57,764 --> 01:46:59,026
So glad to see you.

1057
01:47:00,066 --> 01:47:01,158
Me too.

1058
01:47:07,207 --> 01:47:08,469
I'm looking for a sub.

1059
01:47:08,675 --> 01:47:11,906
It's big and black,
and the driver is a good friend of mine.

1060
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:19,084
Bring it to me.

1061
01:47:20,387 --> 01:47:21,513
What a shame.

1062
01:47:22,022 --> 01:47:23,284
He's just gone.

1063
01:48:11,171 --> 01:48:13,230
Zukovsky really hated you.

1064
01:48:15,508 --> 01:48:18,204
Everything's under control up here.
Are you ready?

1065
01:48:25,118 --> 01:48:26,745
Time to say good night.

1066
01:48:56,316 --> 01:48:57,647
You can't kill me.

1067
01:48:57,851 --> 01:48:59,375
Not in cold blood.

1068
01:49:06,947 --> 01:49:07,947
Bond!

1069
01:49:28,948 --> 01:49:30,040
Call him off.

1070
01:49:37,190 --> 01:49:38,748
I won't ask again.

1071
01:49:40,093 --> 01:49:41,458
Call him off.

1072
01:49:42,962 --> 01:49:44,224
Call him off!

1073
01:49:49,006 --> 01:49:50,006
Renard.

1074
01:49:54,507 --> 01:49:56,099
You wouldn't kill me.

1075
01:49:56,809 --> 01:49:58,140
You'd miss me.

1076
01:50:02,315 --> 01:50:03,407
Dive! Bond--

1077
01:50:09,822 --> 01:50:11,153
I never miss.

1078
01:51:19,392 --> 01:51:20,654
Where is she?

1079
01:51:38,945 --> 01:51:39,945
Ah, James!

1080
01:51:40,446 --> 01:51:41,674
Thought I'd forgotten you, eh?

1081
01:52:14,914 --> 01:52:16,848
Level at 100 feet.

1082
01:52:17,283 --> 01:52:18,750
Hold her steady.

1083
01:52:29,095 --> 01:52:30,392
Level at 100 feet.

1084
01:52:35,835 --> 01:52:38,269
If we can force them up to the surface...

1085
01:52:38,471 --> 01:52:40,336
...they'll show up on the spy satellite...

1086
01:52:40,707 --> 01:52:42,174
...bring out the navy.

1087
01:52:52,819 --> 01:52:54,286
Come on. Get up!

1088
01:52:54,487 --> 01:52:55,579
Over there. Move!

1089
01:52:56,022 --> 01:52:57,250
Move! Go, go!

1090
01:52:57,457 --> 01:52:58,515
Get over there!

1091
01:52:58,725 --> 01:52:59,987
Stay!

1092
01:53:00,193 --> 01:53:01,023
Up!

1093
01:53:31,190 --> 01:53:33,658
Get us level! Level!

1094
01:53:33,860 --> 01:53:35,487
It's all smashed!

1095
01:53:35,695 --> 01:53:36,753
Christmas?

1096
01:53:38,231 --> 01:53:39,698
So we're going up then?

1097
01:53:40,199 --> 01:53:41,928
Slight miscalculation.

1098
01:53:54,046 --> 01:53:55,138
Hold on!

1099
01:53:57,283 --> 01:53:59,217
Hold on, hold on.

1100
01:54:14,534 --> 01:54:15,899
Brace yourself.

1101
01:54:45,131 --> 01:54:46,325
It's flooding!

1102
01:54:47,066 --> 01:54:48,693
Get up to the hatch.

1103
01:54:56,275 --> 01:54:58,004
Damn! Come on!

1104
01:54:58,811 --> 01:55:00,039
Go, go!

1105
01:55:25,171 --> 01:55:27,435
He's opened up the reactor!

1106
01:55:27,740 --> 01:55:29,332
And locked himself in!

1107
01:55:29,542 --> 01:55:31,407
I have to get up there to him.

1108
01:55:31,878 --> 01:55:32,936
We have one chance.

1109
01:55:33,412 --> 01:55:38,008
I'll get out and back in
through the reactor room escape hatch.

1110
01:55:41,621 --> 01:55:45,580
When the light goes red,
press this button so I can get back in.

1111
01:55:46,259 --> 01:55:47,726
James, it's too risky.

1112
01:55:47,927 --> 01:55:49,189
If I don't make it...

1113
01:55:49,395 --> 01:55:51,886
...use this chamber to get out.
Close the hatch.

1114
01:55:52,098 --> 01:55:53,827
Exhale all the way up. Close it.

1115
01:58:27,053 --> 01:58:28,042
Help!

1116
01:58:39,165 --> 01:58:40,359
Come on, come on!

1117
01:58:43,669 --> 01:58:45,534
We're safe from the radiation...

1118
01:58:45,738 --> 01:58:47,968
...if the reactor coolant doesn't burst.

1119
01:58:48,708 --> 01:58:51,404
If he had gotten
the plutonium rod in the reactor...

1120
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:53,976
...we could've written off the whole city.

1121
01:58:58,217 --> 01:59:00,151
Welcome to my nuclear family.

1122
01:59:26,812 --> 01:59:29,280
Are you really gonna
commit suicide for her?

1123
01:59:29,482 --> 01:59:31,882
You forget, I'm already dead.

1124
01:59:32,184 --> 01:59:33,116
Haven't you heard?

1125
01:59:34,253 --> 01:59:35,686
So is she.

1126
01:59:39,291 --> 01:59:40,223
You're lying.

1127
01:59:41,894 --> 01:59:43,418
Liar!

1128
01:59:45,131 --> 01:59:46,257
Liar!

1129
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:09,879
She's waiting for you.

1130
02:01:28,334 --> 02:01:30,234
The hydrogen gas level's too high.

1131
02:01:30,970 --> 02:01:33,131
One spark and the reactor'll blow.

1132
02:01:33,372 --> 02:01:34,930
I have to stop it.

1133
02:01:38,611 --> 02:01:41,409
Go to the top of the sub.
Meet me in the torpedo bay.

1134
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:49,244
The reactor is flooded.

1135
02:01:51,123 --> 02:01:53,785
So it's safe even if this place blows.

1136
02:02:37,937 --> 02:02:39,666
No, it's simply not the case.

1137
02:02:41,373 --> 02:02:42,271
No. Before that.

1138
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:49,274
Any word?

1139
02:02:49,915 --> 02:02:51,405
No. Still no contact.

1140
02:02:55,888 --> 02:02:58,254
Always wanted
to have Christmas in Turkey.

1141
02:03:00,793 --> 02:03:02,317
Was that a Christmas joke?

1142
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:04,189
From me?
No.

1143
02:03:04,964 --> 02:03:06,022
Never.

1144
02:03:06,799 --> 02:03:09,199
So isn't it time
you unwrap your present?

1145
02:03:09,401 --> 02:03:10,834
Oh, I think so.

1146
02:03:15,674 --> 02:03:17,198
Look. What's that?

1147
02:03:18,143 --> 02:03:19,770
-The card.
-He must be nearby.

1148
02:03:19,979 --> 02:03:20,877
Where?

1149
02:03:24,216 --> 02:03:25,444
-Where?
-It picks up...

1150
02:03:25,651 --> 02:03:27,881
...body heat,
so humans come out orange.

1151
02:03:30,089 --> 02:03:31,056
There.

1152
02:03:34,259 --> 02:03:36,819
I thought you said
he was with Dr. Jones?

1153
02:03:41,834 --> 02:03:42,823
It's getting redder.

1154
02:03:50,516 --> 02:03:51,544
007!

1155
02:03:57,016 --> 02:04:00,144
Must be a premature form
of the millennium bug.

1156
02:04:03,055 --> 02:04:04,579
I was wrong about you.

1157
02:04:06,725 --> 02:04:07,919
Yeah?
How so?

1158
02:04:10,016 --> 02:04:13,144
I thought Christmas only comes once a year.
