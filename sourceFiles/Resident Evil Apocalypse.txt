1
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:48,116
My name is Alice.

2
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:50,653
I worked for
the Umbrella Corporation...

3
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:55,055
...the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.

4
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:56,595
I was head of security...

5
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:01,365
...at a secret high-tech facility
called The Hive...

6
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:05,805
...a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental...

7
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:07,705
...viral weaponry.

8
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,315
But there was an incident.

9
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:13,275
The virus escaped
and everybody died.

10
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:16,285
Trouble was...

11
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:18,545
...they didn't stay dead.

12
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,025
The T-virus reanimated their bodies.

13
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:28,485
But I survived.
Myself and one other...

14
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:30,465
...an environmentalist named Matt.

15
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:34,295
When we emerged, we were
seized by Umbrella scientists.

16
00:01:34,475 --> 00:01:35,835
Matt and I were separated.

17
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,605
He's mutating. I want him
in the Nemesis Program.

18
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:40,035
Matt!

19
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:45,645
Take her to the
Raccoon City facility...

20
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:47,545
...and assemble the team.

21
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:49,275
We're reopening The Hive.

22
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:51,875
I want to know
what went on down there.

23
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:54,825
We thought we'd
survived the horror.

24
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:00,935
But we were wrong.

25
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:13,935
You're watching Raccoon 7.
Now the weather, with Terri Morales.

26
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:17,515
It's 6:10 in the a.m. And already
the temperature has reached...

27
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:21,135
...a massive 92 degrees as this
unprecedented heat wave continues.

28
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:25,945
Clear skies in Raccoon City and a
light breeze coming in from the west.

29
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:31,425
And as a special bonus just for you,
we have a pollen count of 0. 7.

30
00:02:31,595 --> 00:02:33,755
That's a record low
for this time of year.

31
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:36,765
Good news for all you hay fever
and asthma sufferers.

32
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:40,755
All in all, it looks like it's gonna be
another beautiful day.

33
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:42,635
Stay with us. After the break...

34
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:45,775
...we're gonna look at your favorite
holiday hot spots.

35
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:15,195
Advance team, proceed.

36
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:27,005
Sir.

37
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:32,745
Holy shit.

38
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:17,255
Excuse us, ma'am.
There's been an incident.

39
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:40,055
Excuse us, sir.
There's been an incident.

40
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:42,215
How bad is it?

41
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:44,885
- You must come with us.
- I must get my daughter.

42
00:04:45,065 --> 00:04:47,185
- It's taken care of.
- What are you doing?

43
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:49,795
You don't understand.
She's left for school.

44
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:35,135
This is U-Gamma 7,
evacuation complete...

45
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:38,505
...but we just lost contact
with Gamma 12.

46
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:14,345
Unit 12 calling for immediate backup
at city hall.

47
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:17,885
Still no explanation for this wave
of unexplained killings...

48
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:20,315
...that is sweeping across the city.

49
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:26,995
A deadly crime spree with no end.

50
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:28,685
Backup, we need backup now!

51
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:31,995
Just like Valentine told us...

52
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:35,835
Off-duty law enforcement personnel,
report for duty immediately.

53
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,715
Give us a hand over here,
this guy's insane!

54
00:06:54,855 --> 00:06:56,685
- It's Valentine.
- Hold your fire.

55
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:58,455
- Valentine!
- They're infected.

56
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,925
Somebody get this ugly bitch
off of me!

57
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:03,395
I told you. Shoot for the head.

58
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:05,765
Please, somebody get her.

59
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:09,735
No! Don't shoot! Don't...

60
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,135
I'm leaving town.
I suggest you do the same.

61
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:14,775
Everyone's leaving the city.

62
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:17,535
We've received reports
of Umbrella Corporation...

63
00:07:17,715 --> 00:07:20,145
...dispatching armed guards
and troop carriers.

64
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:54,695
Move in an orderly fashion
to security checkpoints.

65
00:08:56,915 --> 00:09:00,215
The city is completely contained.
Troops have sealed all exits.

66
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:02,075
The only way out is this bridge.

67
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:05,245
All citizens must pass through
medical scanning.

68
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:08,215
Sir! You better take a look at this.

69
00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:11,825
Family members must pass through
security checkpoints together.

70
00:09:14,035 --> 00:09:18,395
Please proceed in an orderly fashion.
Do not run.

71
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:24,575
- He's clean. Let him pass.
- Next!

72
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:27,075
No pushing, please. Keep in line.

73
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:30,715
Can we get some
reinforcements down here?

74
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:33,215
Chopper Delta, new orders.

75
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:35,445
Proceed directly to
Ravens Gate Bridge.

76
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,245
Reinforcements urgently needed.

77
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:39,515
Copy that, base. On our way.

78
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:05,405
Get it.

79
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:08,015
No! Get off!

80
00:10:08,185 --> 00:10:11,915
Get away! No! Stop! Get off!

81
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,775
No! Get back!

82
00:10:34,315 --> 00:10:36,645
Civilian in trouble. Three o'clock.
Go down.

83
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:38,405
I can't. We have our orders.

84
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:40,845
No! Get back! No!

85
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,145
They're gonna kill her!
Take us down now!

86
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:45,115
She's a civilian. We have orders.

87
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:50,955
Fuck orders!

88
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:53,795
Nicholai, tie me off.

89
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:56,465
Get back! No!

90
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:59,035
Wait!

91
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:14,345
Now!

92
00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:21,915
Take us down! Down, now!

93
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:31,165
Hey. Hey, you okay?

94
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:35,895
Step away from the edge.
Come over to me.

95
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:38,895
- Everything's okay.
- No, it's not.

96
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:43,545
I've seen what happens to you
once you've been bitten.

97
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:47,475
- We can help you.
- There's no going back.

98
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:49,085
No!

99
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:07,295
Move! Peyton!

100
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:11,405
- Peyton!
- Valentine. Hey, Valentine.

101
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:13,735
- Move! Police! Move!
- Let her through.

102
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:18,815
Glad you're here.
We could use the help.

103
00:12:22,955 --> 00:12:25,075
- He has a weak heart.
- Get away from him!

104
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:26,885
Everybody, stand back!

105
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:29,855
- Daddy!
- Get away from him!

106
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:31,895
- Get her away from him!
- It's okay.

107
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:34,155
- Get her away!
- It's okay. Come on.

108
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:37,725
- Daddy!
- It's okay, I got you.

109
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:44,165
- Get him off! Get him off me!
- Move aside!

110
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,395
Get back!

111
00:12:51,015 --> 00:12:53,815
It's here. It's reached the gate.

112
00:12:56,855 --> 00:13:00,255
Why are you here? You should've
got out while you had the chance.

113
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:02,485
These are our people, Jill.

114
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:06,925
- Close them.
- Sir?

115
00:13:07,265 --> 00:13:08,495
Seal the gates.

116
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:10,895
- Our men are still out there...
- Just do it.

117
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:15,595
Oh, my God, they're closing
the gates!

118
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:39,985
This is a biohazard quarantine area.

119
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:44,255
Due to risk of infection, you cannot
be allowed to leave the city.

120
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:46,295
What the fuck is going on here?

121
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:49,235
All appropriate measures
are being taken.

122
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:51,665
The situation is under control.

123
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:53,865
Please return to your homes.

124
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:55,805
You won't get away with this!

125
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:02,175
Let us out!

126
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:09,485
You have five seconds
to turn around...

127
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:11,345
...and return to the city.

128
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:16,195
Do it.

129
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:21,025
Use of live ammunition
has been authorized.

130
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:22,835
Five.

131
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:26,135
- They can't shoot people!
- They won't fire.

132
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:28,065
Three.

133
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:29,435
- Get them back!
- Two.

134
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:31,845
- Move!
- One.

135
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:39,575
Everybody, clear out!

136
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:10,285
Kilo and Romeo squads,
rendezvous at sector 01...

137
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:12,085
...and secure against enemy.

138
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:36,715
- Grenade!
- Grenade!

139
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:45,915
Squads three to seven
are on full retreat.

140
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:50,525
No, sir. Suppression measures
have failed. We can't contain it.

141
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:53,995
The infection is spreading faster
than anyone anticipated.

142
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:55,795
Dr. Ashford.

143
00:15:57,365 --> 00:16:00,235
- Shouldn't you be on the chopper?
- I'm not going.

144
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:04,235
I was instructed to get you and
the other scientists out of the hot zone.

145
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:06,845
You're too important to Umbrella
to be at risk.

146
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:10,345
I'm not leaving without my daughter.

147
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:14,005
I'm sorry, truly.
But the city is sealed.

148
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:17,675
She may have survived the crash,
but we couldn't find her anywhere.

149
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,915
Even if she were still alive,
I couldn't let her out.

150
00:16:21,695 --> 00:16:24,665
The risk of infection is too great.
You must understand.

151
00:16:25,995 --> 00:16:28,255
You do what you have to do.

152
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:29,765
I'm staying.

153
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:53,875
There has to be someone left alive.

154
00:17:54,215 --> 00:17:55,775
Come on.

155
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:57,005
- Matt!
- Take her to the Raccoon City facility.

156
00:18:57,545 --> 00:19:00,145
I want her quarantined.
Close observation.

157
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:07,355
Prepare her for exposure.

158
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:14,855
Up the dosage.

159
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:18,185
Just do it.

160
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:39,115
Inside.

161
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:39,985
Inside.

162
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:42,595
Let's get under cover.

163
00:20:10,885 --> 00:20:12,215
You have to get out.

164
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:14,685
This is my place. I'm hiding here.

165
00:20:14,855 --> 00:20:17,585
- It's big enough for all of us.
- Don't tell me...

166
00:20:17,765 --> 00:20:21,665
Okay, just cool it. Put the gun down.

167
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:27,465
Put the gun down.

168
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:31,105
And, you, take it easy.

169
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:35,545
So does the Raccoon City
Police Department...

170
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:39,235
...have any comment
on what those things are?

171
00:20:40,645 --> 00:20:42,515
What's that you got there?

172
00:20:42,815 --> 00:20:44,715
My Emmy.

173
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:46,855
That's if any of us make it out.

174
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:45,975
Are you all right?

175
00:21:56,055 --> 00:21:57,855
What are you doing?

176
00:21:58,895 --> 00:22:00,955
What's wrong?

177
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:03,595
It's my sister. She's not well.

178
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:04,995
- Maybe I can help.
- No.

179
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:07,225
Out of my way.

180
00:22:08,335 --> 00:22:10,065
Just get out.

181
00:22:16,845 --> 00:22:18,975
You're feeding her? You're sick.

182
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:22,845
Just leave us alone.

183
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,315
No!

184
00:22:32,065 --> 00:22:33,855
- I'm getting out of here.
- Hey.

185
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:36,225
Hey! Hey, no!

186
00:22:37,395 --> 00:22:40,305
Oh, my God!

187
00:22:45,045 --> 00:22:46,765
Hey, help us! Come on!

188
00:22:49,175 --> 00:22:50,975
Get it in there!

189
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:04,455
What the hell was that?

190
00:23:14,475 --> 00:23:16,235
There!

191
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:22,575
Jesus.

192
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:25,475
- What the fuck is that thing?
- What are you doing?

193
00:23:25,645 --> 00:23:27,445
Get back here.

194
00:25:35,275 --> 00:25:37,265
Peyton.

195
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,345
Terri.

196
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:48,785
Peyton.

197
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:54,185
I know.

198
00:25:54,835 --> 00:25:56,665
I count three of them.

199
00:25:57,335 --> 00:25:59,595
They got us boxed in.

200
00:25:59,765 --> 00:26:01,465
What are we gonna do?

201
00:26:01,635 --> 00:26:03,835
Let's go.

202
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:25,515
Jesus.

203
00:26:25,695 --> 00:26:29,285
We're gonna need
more ammo. I'm out.

204
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:43,775
Shit. I'm out.

205
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:05,425
Move.

206
00:28:10,995 --> 00:28:13,625
Who the fuck are you?

207
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:21,735
GTA, motherfucker!

208
00:28:23,545 --> 00:28:24,805
Oh, yeah!

209
00:28:25,145 --> 00:28:26,975
Ten points!

210
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:10,325
Yuri. You okay?

211
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,395
Bite this.

212
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:32,075
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

213
00:29:51,235 --> 00:29:53,755
Pull back!

214
00:30:05,945 --> 00:30:07,175
This way.

215
00:30:10,615 --> 00:30:14,185
This is Olivera. We've been overrun.
Request immediate chopper evac.

216
00:30:45,355 --> 00:30:48,015
We need to find somewhere
to stop for a moment.

217
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:49,915
I don't think that's a good idea.

218
00:30:50,095 --> 00:30:51,755
There might be more of those...

219
00:30:51,925 --> 00:30:52,915
...things.

220
00:30:53,095 --> 00:30:55,565
If there were more,
we'd have seen them by now.

221
00:30:55,735 --> 00:30:58,225
- You know what they are?
- They're bio-weapons...

222
00:30:58,405 --> 00:31:00,395
...from Umbrella labs
beneath the city.

223
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:03,195
How come you know so much
about Umbrella?

224
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,035
I used to work for them.

225
00:31:05,845 --> 00:31:07,395
Damn it.

226
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:09,245
Hold it.

227
00:31:10,345 --> 00:31:11,975
What do you think you're doing?

228
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:14,585
He's wounded.
The infection's spreading.

229
00:31:14,745 --> 00:31:15,975
I'm fine.

230
00:31:17,215 --> 00:31:18,985
You should take care of him now.

231
00:31:19,855 --> 00:31:21,445
It'll be more difficult later.

232
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:25,155
You know that.

233
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:26,855
No.

234
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:28,725
If it comes to that...

235
00:31:28,895 --> 00:31:31,495
...I'll take care of it myself.

236
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:37,935
As you wish.

237
00:31:39,675 --> 00:31:42,335
It's nothing personal.
But in an hour, maybe two...

238
00:31:42,515 --> 00:31:44,065
...you'll be dead.

239
00:31:44,545 --> 00:31:46,875
And moments later,
you'll become one of them.

240
00:31:47,545 --> 00:31:50,075
You'll endanger your friends,
try to kill them...

241
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:52,615
...probably succeed.

242
00:31:54,785 --> 00:31:57,955
I'm sorry. That's just the way it is.

243
00:32:06,665 --> 00:32:08,655
Help me!

244
00:32:58,355 --> 00:33:00,515
There's too many of them.

245
00:33:00,685 --> 00:33:02,355
Let's get out of here.
This way!

246
00:33:16,535 --> 00:33:20,635
Sir, T-virus infection
has reached critical levels.

247
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:25,105
This is a perfect opportunity.

248
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:28,685
Ensure all data streams
are recorded.

249
00:33:28,855 --> 00:33:31,685
Activate Nemesis Program now.

250
00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:10,685
- Hey!
- Here! We're down here!

251
00:34:10,855 --> 00:34:12,915
- Hey!
- Come! We're here!

252
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:18,195
- Where are they going?
- They're landing there. Let's get Yuri!

253
00:34:18,365 --> 00:34:22,825
- Come on, Yuri. We're getting out.
- We'll get you fixed up. Come.

254
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:42,455
Hold on, Yuri. We're almost there.

255
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:46,955
No. No! Don't leave!

256
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:50,565
- Down here! We're coming!
- They dropped something.

257
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:52,465
Maybe a radio. One that works.

258
00:34:52,635 --> 00:34:54,395
Take Yuri.

259
00:35:04,845 --> 00:35:06,405
Hold on, Yuri.

260
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:46,875
Nicholai, put me down.

261
00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:49,515
Okay, rest here.

262
00:35:54,095 --> 00:35:55,615
What is this?

263
00:35:57,365 --> 00:36:00,265
Looks like weapon cases.

264
00:36:00,435 --> 00:36:04,135
We don't need weapons.
We need evacuation!

265
00:36:04,305 --> 00:36:06,935
These weren't meant for us.

266
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:11,405
Yuri!

267
00:36:29,295 --> 00:36:31,165
Plenty to go around.

268
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:52,845
Don't shoot!

269
00:36:56,525 --> 00:36:57,995
I got the power.

270
00:36:58,155 --> 00:37:01,455
Thank you! Owe you one, man.

271
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,795
Shit!

272
00:37:06,965 --> 00:37:08,905
Maybe I was safer outside.

273
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:11,695
Get them guns out of my damn face.

274
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:16,005
Motherfucker, please. Look...

275
00:37:16,575 --> 00:37:18,775
...my shit is custom.

276
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:32,025
What the fuck is that?

277
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:45,765
Shit!

278
00:37:54,715 --> 00:37:57,085
You're going down,
you son of a bitch!

279
00:38:00,455 --> 00:38:01,975
Fuck.

280
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:13,765
Deploy defensive formation.
Take him down.

281
00:38:16,735 --> 00:38:20,405
You fuckers is crazy. Look at that guy,
got a rocket launcher.

282
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:25,475
- What do we have?
- A dozen armed men. Well organized.

283
00:38:33,455 --> 00:38:36,385
- I'm surprised there's anyone left.
- They're S.T.A.R.S.

284
00:38:36,795 --> 00:38:40,525
Special Tactics and Rescue Squad.
They're the best.

285
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:42,855
Fire!

286
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:57,945
Back! Fall back!

287
00:38:58,715 --> 00:39:03,115
- Let's see how good they really are.
- Altering protocols.

288
00:39:22,175 --> 00:39:23,565
S.T.A.R.S.

289
00:39:30,515 --> 00:39:32,705
Oh, shit.

290
00:39:39,685 --> 00:39:41,655
Respect.

291
00:40:02,475 --> 00:40:04,875
Those were some pretty slick moves
back there.

292
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:06,415
I'm good...

293
00:40:06,785 --> 00:40:08,575
...but I'm not that good.

294
00:40:08,755 --> 00:40:11,915
- You should be thankful for that.
- What do you mean?

295
00:40:14,685 --> 00:40:16,385
They did something to me.

296
00:40:16,995 --> 00:40:19,355
I barely feel human anymore.

297
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:25,765
We should keep moving.
Before the sound attracts anything.

298
00:40:35,815 --> 00:40:37,805
Keep moving.

299
00:40:50,395 --> 00:40:53,385
- Hello?
- God, I thought you'd never answer.

300
00:40:53,795 --> 00:40:57,125
- Who is this?
- I can get you out of the city.

301
00:40:57,695 --> 00:40:58,795
All four of you.

302
00:41:00,005 --> 00:41:02,435
But first we have
to come to an arrangement.

303
00:41:02,605 --> 00:41:04,595
Are you ready to make a deal?

304
00:41:05,205 --> 00:41:08,975
- Do we have a choice?
- Not if you want to live past tonight, no.

305
00:41:10,645 --> 00:41:12,375
His name is Dr. Ashford and he...

306
00:41:12,545 --> 00:41:16,605
Runs the genetics and viral research
division of Umbrella Corporation.

307
00:41:16,785 --> 00:41:18,085
What's he want with us?

308
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:20,685
His daughter, Angela,
is trapped in the city.

309
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:23,655
Umbrella was to evac her,
but she didn't make it.

310
00:41:23,825 --> 00:41:25,555
She's hiding out in her school.

311
00:41:25,725 --> 00:41:28,595
We find her, he'll help us escape
the perimeter.

312
00:41:28,765 --> 00:41:29,995
No fucking deal.

313
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:33,135
We find the building with
the thickest walls and doors...

314
00:41:33,305 --> 00:41:36,605
...and we barricade ourselves in.
Sit tight, wait for help.

315
00:41:36,775 --> 00:41:38,835
There won't be any help.

316
00:41:39,005 --> 00:41:41,775
Umbrella knows
they can't contain the infection.

317
00:41:41,945 --> 00:41:46,175
So at sunrise this morning, Raccoon
City will be completely sanitized.

318
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:50,555
What do you mean by "sanitized"?

319
00:41:51,285 --> 00:41:53,185
A precision tactical nuclear device.

320
00:41:53,355 --> 00:41:56,325
- What yield?
- Five kilotons.

321
00:41:57,525 --> 00:41:58,585
- Fuck me.
- Stupid.

322
00:41:58,755 --> 00:42:03,595
- What does that mean?
- It means it'll destroy the infection...

323
00:42:04,395 --> 00:42:06,425
...and all evidence of it.

324
00:42:07,635 --> 00:42:10,225
It's bullshit. It's bullshit!

325
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:12,735
No fucking way would they
get away with that!

326
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,565
- It would be all over the fucking news!
- Cover-up.

327
00:42:15,745 --> 00:42:17,375
Cover-up's already prepared.

328
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:20,375
A meltdown
at the nuclear power plant.

329
00:42:20,545 --> 00:42:24,215
- A tragic accident.
- Not even Umbrella is capable of this.

330
00:42:24,385 --> 00:42:25,975
Not capable?

331
00:42:26,155 --> 00:42:28,525
Peyton, you were there at the bridge.

332
00:42:29,025 --> 00:42:32,615
You know exactly how far
Umbrella will go.

333
00:42:36,395 --> 00:42:38,425
So, what do we do now, huh?

334
00:42:39,665 --> 00:42:42,695
I think we should be out of here
by sunrise.

335
00:42:48,505 --> 00:42:50,295
What if there is no way out and he's
watching us on these cameras...

336
00:42:50,295 --> 00:42:52,075
What if there is no way out and he's
watching us on these cameras...

337
00:42:52,245 --> 00:42:54,445
...like this is some kind
of sick game?

338
00:42:56,415 --> 00:42:58,405
- What is it?
- What's going on?

339
00:42:58,585 --> 00:43:01,075
- Wait.
- Sunrise ain't gonna wait.

340
00:43:01,255 --> 00:43:02,745
No.

341
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,485
- There's something down there.
- Where?

342
00:43:07,995 --> 00:43:09,485
There.

343
00:43:09,665 --> 00:43:10,895
I don't see anything.

344
00:43:11,065 --> 00:43:14,695
That doesn't alter the fact that
there is something down there.

345
00:43:14,865 --> 00:43:17,465
I'm getting sick of this bullshit!

346
00:43:17,635 --> 00:43:19,035
Peyton!

347
00:43:23,945 --> 00:43:25,205
No!

348
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:29,945
He's located another two
S.T.A.R.S. Members.

349
00:43:33,055 --> 00:43:34,645
Nemesis.

350
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:38,015
Run. Just go!

351
00:43:46,305 --> 00:43:48,735
Primary target is identified.

352
00:43:48,905 --> 00:43:51,965
Gentlemen, this is what
we've been waiting for.

353
00:43:53,905 --> 00:43:56,505
Confirm at 2: 18 and 27 seconds.

354
00:43:56,675 --> 00:44:00,115
The Nemesis Program is now
fully activated.

355
00:46:40,045 --> 00:46:42,905
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about your friend.

356
00:46:45,675 --> 00:46:49,275
Let's just get to the school
and find this kid.

357
00:47:25,085 --> 00:47:26,575
This bite...

358
00:47:26,755 --> 00:47:28,445
...it won't stop bleeding.

359
00:47:29,425 --> 00:47:32,295
- Why didn't they see us?
- What?

360
00:47:32,765 --> 00:47:36,525
The chopper. We were right there
in the street in front of the hospital.

361
00:47:36,695 --> 00:47:39,355
- How could they not see us?
- They saw us.

362
00:47:40,165 --> 00:47:41,965
What do you mean?

363
00:47:43,105 --> 00:47:45,365
We're assets, Nicholai.

364
00:47:45,535 --> 00:47:47,375
Expendable assets.

365
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,205
And we've just been expended.

366
00:48:05,965 --> 00:48:07,155
Stop!

367
00:48:07,925 --> 00:48:09,525
I'm not one of those things.

368
00:48:09,695 --> 00:48:13,995
Hey, remember me? Look, I haven't
been bitten or anything. Look.

369
00:48:16,105 --> 00:48:17,695
Climb aboard.

370
00:48:19,305 --> 00:48:21,705
Lloyd Jefferson Wade.

371
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:25,105
You can call me L.J. on account
of the informal situation.

372
00:49:11,695 --> 00:49:14,285
We're gonna have to split up
to search this place.

373
00:49:14,465 --> 00:49:18,555
Forget it. Forget it! I'm not going
out there by myself.

374
00:49:18,735 --> 00:49:20,635
I can go with you.

375
00:49:20,805 --> 00:49:22,765
You, take the first floor.

376
00:49:22,935 --> 00:49:25,305
You, take the second.

377
00:49:25,475 --> 00:49:27,305
I'll take the basement.

378
00:49:27,475 --> 00:49:30,675
- I've never shot a gun before.
- There's nothing to it.

379
00:49:31,015 --> 00:49:32,505
Try to hit them in the head.

380
00:50:32,775 --> 00:50:34,175
I see you, mother...

381
00:50:35,045 --> 00:50:36,535
Oh, shit!

382
00:50:40,715 --> 00:50:42,805
So did you get the call as well?

383
00:50:43,455 --> 00:50:45,545
- What?
- You're here for the girl?

384
00:50:45,715 --> 00:50:47,815
Oh, yeah, yeah. The girl.

385
00:50:48,255 --> 00:50:51,315
Dr. Ashford didn't say he made a deal
with someone else.

386
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:52,985
I guess we're partners.

387
00:50:59,295 --> 00:51:00,825
Shit.

388
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:29,525
Angela?

389
00:51:31,495 --> 00:51:33,765
It's gonna be okay.

390
00:51:34,535 --> 00:51:36,465
There's no need to be afraid.

391
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,035
We're gonna take you home.

392
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:46,575
Oh, my God.

393
00:51:51,715 --> 00:51:53,385
Help me!

394
00:52:09,205 --> 00:52:10,835
Terri?

395
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,010
You can't help her.

396
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,950
Not now.

397
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,610
I've seen what they do.

398
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,920
- Are you Angela?
- Yes.

399
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,650
We should hurry
before they come back.

400
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,290
Hold this.

401
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,570
Angela Ashford, huh?

402
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:58,410
That's a pretty grown-up name
for a little girl.

403
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,510
I'm not a little girl.

404
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,440
Besides...

405
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:06,350
...all my friends call me Angie.
- Angie, huh?

406
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,790
I like that.

407
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:14,920
Those things are in here.

408
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,960
It's okay, honey. They're slow.
We can run around them.

409
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,060
No.

410
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,130
Not them.

411
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,630
Them.

412
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:29,340
Get back.

413
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:57,800
Stay.

414
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,000
Thought you might need a hand.

415
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,800
- You work for Umbrella?
- Used to.

416
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:09,350
Until they left us for dead in this place.
Now I consider myself freelance.

417
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:14,250
Sergeant Nicholai Genovev,
at your service.

418
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,910
- Come on!
- Wait! Angie!

419
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,350
Save the girl! I've got this bitch.

420
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,030
Oh, shit.

421
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,410
From now on, stay right beside me.

422
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,270
It's blocked.

423
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,310
What do we do now?

424
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,730
Wait here. Eyes:

425
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:05,790
Okay?

426
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,090
Thank you.

427
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:36,520
You two know each other?

428
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,590
She's infected.

429
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,030
She's infected on a massive level.

430
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,870
- How can you know that?
- Because she is too.

431
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,770
You're infected? When were
you gonna tell us that?

432
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,980
- Let me see.
- No.

433
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,250
You know I'm not gonna hurt you.

434
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,690
Let me see.

435
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,710
It's the antivirus,
the cure to the T-virus.

436
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,120
There's a cure?

437
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,780
How did you get this?

438
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:40,420
My daddy.
My daddy made it for me.

439
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,960
He's sick.
And someday, I'll get sick too.

440
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,890
He just wanted to stop that.

441
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:48,790
When I was little...

442
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:50,860
...I had to walk on crutches.

443
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,490
They said I'd never get better,
just worse.

444
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,600
He found a way
to make me stronger.

445
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,710
The T-virus.

446
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,550
Then they took the invention
away from him.

447
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,340
Get out of my house!

448
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:16,790
He's not a bad man.

449
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,490
He didn't mean for any of this.

450
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,770
It's okay.

451
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:34,000
Don't shoot! He's cool.

452
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,840
He made a deal with Dr. Doom,
same as you.

453
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,020
How many of you guys are there?

454
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,920
What do you mean?

455
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,450
Nicholai.

456
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,500
When were you bitten?

457
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:57,360
- Three hours ago.
- What the...?

458
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:03,440
It's your lucky day.

459
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:10,640
Should have told me you got bit.
I'm hanging with you and shit.

460
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:18,210
- Let me speak to my daughter.
- First, you tell us how we're getting out.

461
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,930
There's a helicopter
already being prepped.

462
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:24,860
It takes off in 47 minutes.

463
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:29,230
It'll be the last transport to leave
Raccoon City before they detonate.

464
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,170
I take it this helicopter isn't
laid out just for us.

465
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:35,570
No. It has another purpose,
but it'll be lightly guarded.

466
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:39,700
- Where's the evac site?
- May I speak to my daughter now?

467
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:46,580
- Daddy?
- Hey, sweetheart.

468
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,380
- Are you all right?
- When can I see you?

469
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:51,990
Soon. These people will
bring you to see me.

470
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,850
I'll see you very soon.

471
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:55,690
Put the lady back on.

472
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:58,090
Where do we have to go?

473
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,390
The helicopter will be at city hall.

474
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:02,620
I suggest you make haste.

475
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,130
Computers...

476
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,540
...so unreliable.

477
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,010
Just like people.

478
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:32,400
You really thought I didn't know?

479
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,570
So, what are you injecting me with?

480
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,470
The antivirus.

481
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,180
The T-virus reanimates dead cells.

482
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:56,380
Basically, bringing the dead to life.

483
01:00:56,550 --> 01:01:00,750
Or in a living human,
it can cause uncontrollable mutation.

484
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:05,390
Or it can help her walk again,
if the virus is kept in check with this.

485
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,860
- Angie's infected?
- Yes.

486
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:10,800
The cellular growth is enough
to regenerate her...

487
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:13,100
...but not enough to cause mutation.

488
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:15,710
And they infected you
with the T-virus as well?

489
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,970
Yeah.

490
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,840
But don't worry.
I'm not contagious.

491
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,180
Here.

492
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,810
Tape the story.
I'll see that it gets put to good use.

493
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:33,680
My name is Alice.

494
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:36,790
I worked for the
Umbrella Corporation...

495
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,800
...the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.

496
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:47,300
I was head of security at a secret
high-tech facility called The Hive...

497
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:51,310
...a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental...

498
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,270
...viral weaponry.

499
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,800
Let's go.

500
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:29,490
You missed one.

501
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:02,920
We have to hurry.

502
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:06,130
- We're okay. We have time.
- No! We have to hurry.

503
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:11,540
- Holy shit! We stealing his ride!
- Take off.

504
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,800
- I said, take off!
- What's the rush?

505
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:20,580
We've been expecting you.

506
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:27,390
- Perimeter secure.
- All sectors locked down.

507
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:37,870
- Angie!
- Daddy!

508
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,670
- I knew you wouldn't leave me.
- No. Never.

509
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:46,880
Discard primary weaponry.

510
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:04,630
The two of you showed such promise,
but we had to see you in action.

511
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,460
And most impressive you've been.

512
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,400
You're like brother and sister.

513
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:13,940
Heightened speed, strength,
agility, the same killer instincts.

514
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:16,340
Parallel strands of research.

515
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:20,600
And now...
Now we'll discover which is superior.

516
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:25,210
Fight him.

517
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:27,920
No.

518
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:30,420
Fight him, or they die.

519
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:34,120
What makes you think I care?

520
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:42,460
Daddy! Daddy, no.

521
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:44,620
No.

522
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:47,830
He was a valuable asset
to the corporation.

523
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:51,000
I don't even care
about these people.

524
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:04,290
Begin.

525
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:45,670
He's mutating. I want him
in the Nemesis Program.

526
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,950
Matt!

527
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:55,630
Cellular structure breaking down.

528
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:58,630
T-virus is manifesting itself
in a genetic mutation.

529
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:05,260
We're seeing similar
cellular regeneration.

530
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:10,270
I'm sorry.

531
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:13,170
Oh, Matt. I'm so sorry.

532
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,480
Finish him.

533
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,950
I said, finish him.

534
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:24,710
No.

535
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:27,650
No.

536
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:32,250
Don't you understand
how important you are to me?

537
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:34,630
That creature is one thing,
but you...

538
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:38,360
...somehow you bonded
with the T-virus on a cellular level.

539
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:43,170
You adapted it, changed it.
You became magnificent.

540
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,710
- I became a freak.
- No.

541
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:49,640
You're not mutation.
You're evolution.

542
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:53,910
With my help, just imagine
what you can achieve.

543
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,410
What about him?

544
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:02,820
Evolution has its dead ends.

545
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:06,360
Now, finish this.
Put him out of his misery...

546
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:08,660
...and come with me.

547
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,260
No.

548
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:17,970
You're such
a disappointment to me.

549
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:19,700
All that strength...

550
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,280
...but no will to use it.

551
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:25,410
What a waste.

552
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:37,890
Prepare for takeoff.

553
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:43,230
Sanitation of Raccoon City
to commence on my mark.

554
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:54,230
Kill her.

555
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,450
What are you doing?

556
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,400
Get us airborne.

557
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:33,580
This is Cain. Priority overload.
Initiate launch proceedings.

558
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,410
Detonation set
at T-minus 5 minutes.

559
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,420
Angie, get down!

560
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,500
Why haven't we taken off?

561
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:59,510
Because I usually drive a Cadillac.

562
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:21,530
Surrender, or we open fire.

563
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:52,990
Drop it.

564
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,400
Alice!

565
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,510
Drop your weapon and surrender.

566
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,320
Let's get this thing in the air!

567
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:57,320
You have to get up.

568
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:05,860
Matt...

569
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,370
Come on, we have to go.
We have to go. Come on.

570
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:16,150
Come on.

571
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,460
Get up!

572
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:31,260
If you expect me to beg, I will not.

573
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,690
Wait.

574
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,810
Killing me won't put things right.

575
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:48,770
No...

576
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:50,780
...but it's a start.

577
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,290
Are you going to be all right?

578
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:40,980
Hang on to something!

579
01:17:57,570 --> 01:17:59,470
We're going down!

580
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,980
U-Gamma 9 to base.
Confirmation.

581
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:41,810
We've located the crash site.

582
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,520
Fetch the medical team.

583
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,330
What about the others?

584
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,000
No other bodies found, sir.

585
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:19,080
We have unconfirmed reports
of disaster at Raccoon City.

586
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:21,090
These shocking images just in.

587
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:24,390
A mysterious plague
or viral outbreak has run rampant...

588
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,890
Implicating Umbrella Corporation
in deaths of innocent citizens.

589
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:32,430
This tape, work of former Raccoon 7
anchorwoman Terri Morales.

590
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,040
New evidence now
discredits earlier reports...

591
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:38,700
- Nothing more than sick joke.
- Fake videotape totally discredited.

592
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,430
Nothing more than a big hoax.

593
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,480
Playing on the very real tragedy...

594
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:45,050
...which overwhelmed
Raccoon City this week.

595
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:48,380
The reactor at the nuclear
power station went critical.

596
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:53,150
The worst atomic disaster since the
Russian Chernobyl incident in 1986.

597
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:56,720
The state governor personally
thanked the Umbrella Corporation...

598
01:19:56,890 --> 01:19:58,260
...for their swift action.

599
01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:02,130
The perpetrators of the hoax,
Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera...

600
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,200
...now being sought
for questioning by the police.

601
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:24,920
Alice.

602
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:33,000
Alice, wake up.

603
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:38,890
Can you hear me?

604
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:43,370
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

605
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:47,370
Good.

606
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:52,650
Begin the purging process.

607
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,110
Her recovery's remarkable.

608
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,770
And her powers,
both physical and mental...

609
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:28,940
...are developing
at a geometric rate.

610
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,600
Where are you?

611
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:46,370
You're safe.

612
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:48,370
Come on.

613
01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:52,710
That's it.

614
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,810
There we are.

615
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:08,650
Do you know what that is?

616
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:12,120
It's a pen.

617
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,730
You see?

618
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,690
You try.

619
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,700
That's it.

620
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:23,360
Pen.

621
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:30,810
Look at me.

622
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:35,480
Can you remember anything?

623
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,750
You remember your name?

624
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,550
My name?

625
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:45,250
My name.

626
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:52,560
I want her under
24-hour observation.

627
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,560
A complete set of blood work.

628
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:58,100
Chemical and electrolyte analysis
by the end of the day.

629
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,770
My name.

630
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,540
- My name.
- Sir.

631
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:05,710
Advanced reflex testing is a priority.

632
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:06,910
My name.

633
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:09,920
- Monitor electrical impulses...
- Sir.

634
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,550
Sir!

635
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:17,120
What is it?

636
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:23,390
My name...

637
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,440
...is Alice.

638
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:31,940
And I remember everything.

639
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:05,170
This is central.
Request immediate backup.

640
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,330
Maximum response.

641
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:49,510
Thank you, gentlemen.
We'll take over from here.

642
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:54,020
- On whose authority?
- Classified. Level six authorization.

643
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:58,090
Sorry, sir.

644
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,050
Let them go.

645
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:02,850
Good to have you back.

646
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,050
Are you all right?

647
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,660
Program Alice activated.

648
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:15,830
What did they do to you?

649
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:39,480
This is a product of the
Umbrella Corporation.

650
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:42,170
Our business is life itself.

651
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:45,190
Some side effects may occur.
