1
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,904
Hi. It's me.
Um...

2
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:33,658
I know you're in Arizona for
the wedding, but I really need...

3
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,412
I just wanna talk to you.

4
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,081
Okay? So can you please
call me back?

5
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,269
Okay, everybody.

6
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:04,981
Let's get on the dance floor
for the Minnesota bride and groom,

7
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,817
Mr. and Mrs. Scott Thomas.

8
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,990
What do you think?

9
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,993
- This is my best day ever.
- No. Best day?

10
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,995
- Mm-hmm.
- It's pretty good.

11
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,123
Yeah. How about you?

12
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,209
- Is it my best day ever?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,837
Excluding the bachelor party, right?

14
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,256
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

15
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,966
Of course it was.

16
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,011
I gotta be honest though.

17
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,765
I'm pretty open-minded about
talking about the honeymoon.

18
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,601
- Really?
- Yeah, I am.

19
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,020
You and me and a bottle of red.

20
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,939
Deserted beach in Cabo.

21
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:50,026
- I like the sound of that.
- Me too.

22
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,654
Let's say good-bye to our closest
75 friends and family.

23
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,948
Who wants a shot, baby?

24
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,451
Come on. Little tequila
for the bride and groom?

25
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,620
I'm still good
with champagne, Lumpy.

26
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,413
Yeah, maybe when this dance
is over. Okay?

27
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,625
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah.

28
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,585
- It's over.
- It sure is.

29
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,630
Come on. Come on.
You gotta celebrate, right?

30
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,423
Come on.
You only get married once.

31
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,217
You know, until you turn 40
and you trade in

32
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,136
for the newer, sleeker,
better-looking models.

33
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,387
- I'm kidding.
- He's kidding.

34
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,807
- Okay, one time.
- All right!

35
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,100
Oh, shit.
I thought you had...

36
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:26,020
- My dress.
- I'm so sorry.

37
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,563
It's okay. It's okay.
It's not a big deal.

38
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,358
Kristin, I'm really sorry.
I didn't...

39
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:34,028
I thought she was...

40
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,198
Kristin insisted on
this destination wedding.

41
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:41,244
I would have loved
a Christmas wedding in Minneapolis.

42
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,038
That would have been lovely, too.

43
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,040
But, you know, I told her

44
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,084
that it was gonna cost
everybody a fortune

45
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,127
to fly down to Phoenix.

46
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,422
Honestly, you can't even tell.

47
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,800
Will you button
the little buttons on the back?

48
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,134
Be careful.

49
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,971
You don't wanna rip
a $2,000 dress.

50
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,431
It was 3,000.

51
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,142
- Does Scott know that?
- Mm-mmm.

52
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,562
Man, I really, really hope
I didn't ruin her dress.

53
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,106
Oh, my God.
Would you stop it?

54
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,859
And even if you did, when is she
gonna wear the thing again?

55
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:16,112
- I like the way you think.
- That is good.

56
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,905
- Oh.
- Hey, man.

57
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,448
Thanks again for that loan.

58
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,784
- Yeah. Sure, sure.
- No, I... I mean it.

59
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,327
That was too much.

60
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,122
Well, consider it
a wedding gift, okay?

61
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,623
Oh, what are you talking about?

62
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,459
No. I'm paying you back for that.
It was way too much.

63
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,461
No, I'm serious.
I didn't get you a wedding gift.

64
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,130
- Take the cash.
- I can't.

65
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,965
- Take it.
- Well...

66
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,134
- Did you just kiss your tie?
- No, I'm...

67
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,677
I've got drool.

68
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,345
- Oh, that's charming.
- Thank you.

69
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,139
You know the thing is...

70
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,182
I need it.
I'll be honest with you.

71
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,143
It's embarrassing,
but I had no idea

72
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,978
the honeymoon
was gonna cost so much

73
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,522
and Rick screwed me so hard
on that commission.

74
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:54,191
Scotty, Scotty, Scotty.
Just stop.

75
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,152
- I love you, man.
- Oh, boy.

76
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,486
- I do.
- Okay.

77
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,113
Yeah, I do.
I wanna touch you.

78
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,032
- Oh, come on.
- I wanna get my hands on you.

79
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,159
- Okay.
- Okay. Is it too much?

80
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,161
- That is too much.
- All right. I got carried away.

81
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,121
Just man up and drink,
would you?

82
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,749
What is this?

83
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,044
- I'm not even sure what it is.
- Oh, my God.

84
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,171
You know, I didn't say anything

85
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,173
when Lumpy gargled champagne
during his toast,

86
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,675
or he decided to helicopter
a six-month-old

87
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,885
during the groom's dinner.

88
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,888
He kept referring to himself
as "The Baby Whisperer."

89
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,598
No. It's not funny.

90
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,142
The kid vomited mashed peas
all over the lobby.

91
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,810
We have to pay for that.

92
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,021
Barkeep, another one.

93
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,254
How about a kiss? Come on.

94
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,332
All right, I'm up.
All right. All right.

95
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,959
Yeah. Yeah.

96
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,469
I... I'm all right.

97
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,267
Set 'em up!
Let's go.

98
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,355
- Lumpy, man.
- Hey.

99
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,691
- All right. All right.
- Yeah.

100
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,277
Hey, buddy, I...
Why don't you call it a night, man?

101
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,738
- Hmm. What? What?
- Time to pack it in.

102
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,364
- What?
- Yeah.

103
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,074
- You're cutting off...
- Dude.

104
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,701
You're cutting off
the best man?

105
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,245
Dude, come on.
You threw up in the women's bathroom.

106
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,747
- No, I didn't. Did I?
- You did.

107
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,332
- One more drink.
- No, no, no. Please. Come on.

108
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,251
Aw! You're so lame.

109
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,295
You're just...
You're just lame.

110
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,256
No, all right.
Y-Y-You're lame. You're lame-o.

111
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,467
- All right. I know.
- You're the lamest...

112
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,010
Ooh. Oh!

113
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,094
You okay?

114
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,763
Yes! Yeah!
I'm good. Yep.

115
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,306
Okay.

116
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,894
Thanks a lot,
Captain Lame. Captain Lame-o.

117
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,354
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's great now.

118
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,316
Tomorrow morning
it's gonna be another story.

119
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,320
Livin' in a lamish community,
churnin' up that lame butter.

120
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,322
Sorry.

121
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,032
Look out, everybody!

122
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,587
- Shut up in there!
- You shut up!

123
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,514
Hmm.

124
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,355
Come on. Get up.

125
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,483
Ramsey, I'm not kidding.
You can't be late again.

126
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,242
Get up.

127
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,701
I'm up.

128
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,208
What is your problem?

129
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,211
Give me one second.

130
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,964
And don't hassle your mother.

131
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,674
What's going on?

132
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,010
Nothing.

133
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,055
I'm going to bed.

134
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,478
I don't know a Dave.

135
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,522
David? No.

136
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,567
Danny?
My boss's name is Danny.

137
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,196
He might be a Gemini.

138
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,532
What kind of danger?

139
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,868
Hey, um, you're gonna have to
try harder with Winston.

140
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,872
- Where is he?
- He went back to bed.

141
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,874
Oh.

142
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,669
I should go too.

143
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,299
Okay.
I'll call you tomorrow.

144
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,011
Bye.

145
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,181
Ms. Shirley?

146
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,352
She says that Dan's in danger.

147
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,605
You know, Dan from work.

148
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,817
I'm gonna tell him.

149
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,447
You should call her sometime.

150
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,784
By the way,

151
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,746
you never told me where you slept
the other night.

152
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,291
Why don't you ask Ms. Shirley?

153
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,335
God, if you were
with some guy...

154
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,087
I was at a friend's house.

155
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,672
What friend?

156
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,802
Hey! Aren't you gonna
eat something?

157
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,512
I'm not hungry.

158
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,615
That's it?

159
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,909
Sorry. I have to
get my day started.

160
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,915
Yeah, me too.

161
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,544
What?

162
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,214
I drove all the way up here
to see you.

163
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,842
Couldn't we at least
have breakfast?

164
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,427
Hang out a little?

165
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,679
It's a small town.

166
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,481
Hey.

167
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,859
Maybe I can arrange
a day off next week.

168
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,986
You know what?

169
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,530
Forget it.

170
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,834
Jesus!

171
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,920
Hot date?

172
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,591
What are you doing here?

173
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,969
You know I like to watch.

174
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,720
I hate it when
you pull the blinds, Dad.

175
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,931
I'm not your dad.

176
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,144
Dad, father, father, dad...
Whatever.

177
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,895
I need 50 bucks.

178
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,981
I don't have 50 bucks.

179
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,733
This is really your best option?
Blackmailing a priest?

180
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,736
Think of it
as community welfare.

181
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,738
Isn't there a doctor or a lawyer
you can hustle?

182
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,658
If you want me to go back to
taking it out of the offering tray,

183
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,994
I will.

184
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,382
They just found him
lying there?

185
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,759
Yeah. I don't know
what he was doing.

186
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,723
- How...
- I don't know.

187
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:32,352
A security camera caught him going
out the back door at, like, 1:30.

188
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,229
There's blood
all over his room.

189
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,731
I... I don't know.

190
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,942
Hi, honey.

191
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,863
Everyone is just devastated.

192
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,742
Is there anything that Roger and I
could do for you?

193
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,161
No, I don't think so, Gail.
Thanks though.

194
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,998
Well, I don't mean
to upset you,

195
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:58,879
but this might be
a liability here.

196
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,757
Mom, I don't think
that this is a good time.

197
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,010
You know, sweetheart,
you cannot be too careful.

198
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,555
The hotel should
take responsibility.

199
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,265
We could blame the bartenders.

200
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,100
Have you two eaten anything yet?

201
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,353
Uh, thank you, Dad.
We're not hungry.

202
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,397
The resort has a complimentary
continental breakfast.

203
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:23,737
Could you guys go say good-bye
to some of the guests?

204
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,989
- Yes, we could, honey.
- That would be really helpful.

205
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,075
All right. Yeah.

206
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,958
- I'm sorry.
- Wow.

207
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,210
I'm sorry.

208
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,797
I'm sorry I don't have a referral
to another provider.

209
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,675
So there's only one company
that can ship a body?

210
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,428
You could keep the deceased
in Arizona, have the services here.

211
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,431
No, no, no. The funeral and
the burial have to be in Minnesota.

212
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,516
Um...

213
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,061
Then I guess you're
out of options.

214
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,814
Really, Mr. Huxley?
There's nothing else?

215
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,149
'Cause I'm in
a tight spot here.

216
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,509
- Oh!
- Oh!

217
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,179
Oh, God! What the hell
are you doing?

218
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,682
Oh. Oh, uh... He, um...

219
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,268
Jesus Christ.
Can we go, please?

220
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,896
Oh, my God.

221
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,324
There are so many questions
I have for you.

222
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,576
There are so many things I'm
curious about, but you know what?

223
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,914
I think it would be best if we just
never talked about that again.

224
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,791
- Okay? Ever.
- I think that's fine.

225
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,542
- Great.
- Great.

226
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,087
Let's go back to the hotel, we'll
pack our stuff and call the airline.

227
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,923
See if they can get us on a redeye
back to Minneapolis.

228
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,509
What...
Minneapolis? No.

229
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,345
- Uh, we're going home now?
- Yeah.

230
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,930
Why?

231
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,308
I assumed that the funeral
would be after the honeymoon.

232
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,937
You... You wanna
postpone the funeral?

233
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,438
Who postpones a funeral?

234
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,026
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
I mean, our honeymoon...

235
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,445
I've been dreaming about it
since I was a little girl.

236
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,615
I'm supposed to be
in a caftan under a palm tree.

237
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,033
What's a caftan?

238
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,160
You don't know
what a caftan is?

239
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,871
I know you never got Lumpy.
Okay? Let's just be honest.

240
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,540
You didn't want him
to be my best man.

241
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,041
I didn't say that.
What I said was,

242
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,960
you two didn't spend
much time together anymore.

243
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,545
What does that mean?
We're men.

244
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,840
Men don't spend
a lot of time together.

245
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,675
We have to go home
because I have to take care

246
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,511
of my friend's
funeral arrangement, okay?

247
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,767
I can't believe this happened
on our wedding night.

248
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,565
Hey, will you hold this?
It's Lumpy's.

249
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,317
Then we can make some calls,
just let people know what happened.

250
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,904
There are only six numbers stored.

251
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,948
Two of them
are for pizza delivery.

252
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,703
It's not a joke.
It's true.

253
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,038
- Who's Ramsey Anderson?
- No idea.

254
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:06,042
Probably a friend from law school
or the restaurant maybe.

255
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:15,051
So, after the autopsy they're gonna
ship the body back to Minnesota

256
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,387
- by budget courier.
- Budget courier?

257
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,097
- Is that a normal thing?
- I don't know.

258
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:23,310
I've, weirdly, never had to ship
a friend's body anywhere before.

259
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,687
It's still gonna be $2,000.

260
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,105
We don't have it.

261
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,693
Not after the open bar and
the welcome baskets for the guests.

262
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,029
And a $2,000 dress.

263
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:38,617
- So, it wasn't worth it?
- Come on, I didn't say that.

264
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,578
We're gonna have to use the honeymoon
money for the funeral though.

265
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:45,582
What choice do I have, Kristin?
He was my best man.

266
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,691
Hi.

267
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,237
Aren't you supposed
to be in school?

268
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,656
Someone's gotta shop for food.

269
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,077
Yeah. Well, you don't have a job.

270
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,620
Neither do you.

271
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,164
Why you gotta be like that?

272
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,333
I'm trying to make things work,
you know?

273
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,335
I thought we had a deal here.

274
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,254
I don't like that deal.

275
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,297
I didn't ask if you liked it.

276
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,675
Hey. I'm not finished.

277
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,763
I'm not finished.

278
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,477
This is your family, Ramsey.

279
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:50,647
Whether you like it or not,
we're family.

280
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,663
You're welcome?

281
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,208
Can we just go?

282
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,087
- I have to tell your mother.
- No!

283
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,756
I know what I promised, but I
could get in serious trouble here.

284
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,842
It was just cold medicine.

285
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,638
You don't look
like you have a cold.

286
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,767
You're lucky I was able
to talk the sheriff

287
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,186
into releasing you into my custody.

288
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,230
Yeah, really lucky.

289
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,898
Ramsey.

290
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,692
Ramsey, wait.

291
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,404
Ramsey.

292
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,200
Look, it's seriously decent of you
to spring me from my incarceration.

293
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,576
But I'm fine, okay?

294
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:13,373
I know why people buy cold medicine.
It's to make crystal meth.

295
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,583
Why'd you steal it anyway?
I just gave you money.

296
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,461
- I spent it.
- On drugs?

297
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,338
Don't you have candles to light,

298
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,883
or, like, wine and crackers
to hand out?

299
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,427
That's what you think I do?

300
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,637
Mood lighting and catering?

301
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,306
I don't do drugs, okay?

302
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,393
You only have
a couple of more months of this.

303
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,478
Don't blow it!

304
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,277
Welcome aboard
Valdez flight 896,

305
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,279
redeye to Minneapolis, Minnesota.

306
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,531
It's gonna be a full flight tonight,
folks, so we ask you

307
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,783
to find your seat and stow
your luggage as quickly as possible

308
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,161
for an on-time departure.

309
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,420
- Oh, my God.
- What? What's wrong?

310
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,923
I think I packed the Ambien
in my suitcase.

311
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,301
- Okay, are...
- I can't believe this.

312
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,386
- Are you sure?
- Oh, my God.

313
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,555
Well, look...
Look in that guy.

314
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,307
Jesus.

315
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,100
Kris, it's only
a four-hour flight.

316
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,352
But I need to sleep.

317
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,939
I need a Xanax.

318
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,651
Jesus. How many pills
are you taking?

319
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,196
My God.
You're like a pharmacy in there.

320
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,781
These ones are the white ones,
not the orange ones.

321
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,282
They're like half as strong.

322
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,077
And the blue ones, those are the ones
that are for crazies.

323
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:36,206
Okay, Elvis, when did chronic
anxiety take over your life?

324
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,832
Am I missing something?

325
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,835
Why are... You're like announcing this
to the entire plane.

326
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,671
Oh, relax. He's the one guy
that's eavesdropping.

327
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,091
We don't even know him.
Who cares?

328
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,218
Hi.

329
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,180
I'm Neil.
Your mom's cousin's son?

330
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,848
We met at the reception.

331
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,352
- Right.
- Hi, Neil.

332
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,813
- I'm really sorry about your friend.
- Thank you, Neil.

333
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,359
I don't have anxiety issues.

334
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,736
- Oh, I wasn't even paying attention.
- He wasn't listening.

335
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,404
I have a slight fear of flying.

336
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,116
Xanax helps take the edge off
during takeoff.

337
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,326
- Okay.
- But don't need 'em.

338
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,829
Not like I'm addicted.

339
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:18,123
Kris, he doesn't care.

340
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,458
How are you at flying?
Do you want one?

341
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:22,752
They're the white ones.
They're not the orange ones.

342
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:26,881
No. Thank you though.
I appreciate that.

343
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,634
Um, gosh, you know,

344
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,805
that is a "D" on my ticket,

345
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,016
which means I have the wrong seat.

346
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:40,353
So I'm gonna scooch on over.

347
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,592
Rick going to be
at the funeral?

348
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,802
Oh, well, yeah, probably.

349
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:16,055
We've both known Lumpy
since junior high, so guessing.

350
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,350
Such a real estate crook.

351
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:24,522
Yeah, and his dad's my boss,
so please remember that, Kris.

352
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,441
I thought you didn't have to
pay a referral fee

353
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,109
if it was within the office.

354
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,987
You do sometimes.
It depends.

355
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:32,655
He fails.

356
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,993
Ethan risks everything to be with
the woman that he loves,

357
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,330
but he fails.
Why?

358
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:44,500
Why would Wharton
have Ethan and Mattie fail?

359
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,545
Anna? What do you think?

360
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,756
I didn't read it.

361
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,216
Did anybody read it?

362
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:56,471
No. See, that's the thing
about literature...

363
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,306
You have to read it.

364
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:02,310
Okay. For tomorrow...

365
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,188
I want everyone
to finish Ethan Frome.

366
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,858
- Lunch?
- Sure.

367
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,986
I was talking to her.

368
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,711
All I'm saying is
that I can't think of a time

369
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:31,839
when Lumpy wasn't either drunk
or naked or both.

370
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,008
Yeah, everyone lets loose
on vacation.

371
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:37,220
Clearly you've forgotten the hairy
bead rack incident on Bourbon St.

372
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,514
Oh, yeah.

373
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,184
I mean, New Orleans was struggling
through a post-Katrina holocaust,

374
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,811
and Lumpy thinks he can
brighten everyone's day

375
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,981
by hanging beads from...
What did he call it?

376
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,148
His hairy button.

377
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,984
- Hairy button.
- That was hilarious.

378
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,610
- Oh, Scott.
- Okay, listen. You know what?

379
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:56,322
I agree, in the last year the
drinking got a little out of control.

380
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,616
But I don't know
what you want me to say, Kris.

381
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:02,036
I mean, he was my best friend.

382
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:06,874
But he wasn't your best friend.
He was your oldest friend.

383
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,876
There's a difference.

384
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,878
I don't care what you call him.

385
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,047
I knew Lumpy
better than anyone.

386
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,385
I'm very sorry for your loss,

387
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,596
but Lawrence is no longer
a law student here.

388
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,892
What? N... No.
That must be a mistake.

389
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,687
Well, he hasn't been enrolled
for almost a year.

390
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,564
A year?

391
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,316
Did he transfer
to another school?

392
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,445
I don't have any record
of a transcript request.

393
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,071
He flunked out of law school?

394
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,573
Actually, his grades
were quite strong.

395
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,951
- He left for personal reasons.
- What does that mean?

396
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,871
I... I'm sorry. I don't have
any further information.

397
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:49,584
But I'd be happy to put his funeral
announcement on our website.

398
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,254
Uh, thank you... Actually, could you
search for one more student for us?

399
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,298
It's a friend of Lumpy's.

400
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,675
- Lumpy?
- Lawrence. Sorry.

401
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,385
Of course.

402
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,554
Uh, what's the name?

403
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,556
- Uh, Ra...
- Ramsey Anderson.

404
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,266
I'll check.

405
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:12,648
Sorry. Lots of Andersons.
No Ramsey.

406
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,031
Yeah. This is it.

407
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,914
- Hi.
- Hi.

408
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,166
- Two?
- No, we're actually not here to eat.

409
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,960
Um, we're friends of Lumpy's.

410
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,298
Last time I saw Lumps
we were totally wasted,

411
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:40,134
and we ended up...

412
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,719
N-Never mind.

413
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,429
How old are you?

414
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,807
I'm afraid we have
some really bad news.

415
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:49,143
Uh, L-Lumpy passed away

416
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,145
- over the weekend.
- What?

417
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,440
It was an accident. It was
a very unfortunate accident.

418
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,484
We just wanted
to tell his manager

419
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,985
and let everyone know
about the funeral.

420
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,654
Oh, my God. He O.D.'d.

421
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,199
No. No, no, no.
Why would you think he O.D.'d?

422
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,700
He died on a cactus.

423
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,328
Can you tell your manager

424
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,539
that we're here
to talk to him or her?

425
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,875
Uh, sure. Lumpy hasn't worked here
in a couple of months though.

426
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,293
He hasn't?

427
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,170
No, he was...
he was fired.

428
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,005
What?

429
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,466
How could he fire Lumpy?
Lumpy loved this job.

430
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:21,968
- Is he in there?
- You can't go in there!

431
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,469
Scott, don't do that.
I swear to God.

432
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:24,971
Bruce doesn't like
to be interrupted.

433
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,348
Oh, eureka.

434
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,892
- What?
- Oh. God, sorry.

435
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,687
- Um...
- You can't just barge in here.

436
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,231
I just wanted to talk to you,
but I-I'll wait outside.

437
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,653
I think he needs a minute.

438
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,119
He was stealing?

439
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,912
Uh, we caught him on camera.

440
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,707
No. There's no way.
Not Lumpy.

441
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,710
Look, bartending
is a cash business.

442
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,130
It happens, you know.
Sooner or later, temptation wins out.

443
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,675
Did you call the police? Is there
a report that was filed or something?

444
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,595
The owners wanted to,
but I never did.

445
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,723
- Why?
- I think he was in a bad place.

446
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,933
What do you mean?

447
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:14,687
There was a lot of booze
and, uh,

448
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,106
some girl up north
in, uh, Lutsen.

449
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:19,859
Do you remember her name,
by any chance?

450
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,944
Oh, man. Uh...

451
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,238
Was it Ramsey?

452
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,032
It... Maybe. Yeah.
That sounds right.

453
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:29,035
Okay. Thank you for your time.

454
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,745
And sorry about barging in again.

455
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,830
I'm real sorry
about your friend.

456
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:34,749
- Everyone liked Lumpy.
- Yeah.

457
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,834
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

458
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,170
Don't touch it!

459
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,297
Thank you.

460
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,808
Hey.

461
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,312
Aren't you going to work?

462
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,482
I called Dan.
I told him I wasn't feeling well.

463
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,778
- Is he okay?
- Hmm?

464
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,488
Wasn't he in danger?

465
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,450
You don't believe
in Ms. Shirley, do you?

466
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,202
She's from
Thief River Falls, Mom.

467
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,830
It is a gift.
She has a real gift.

468
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,667
Yeah.
For taking your money.

469
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:21,003
The first time I talked to her,
she knew everything about me.

470
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,506
Names.

471
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,466
She knew names.

472
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,635
Have you ever heard
of caller I.D. and Google?

473
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,975
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

474
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,687
Can I talk to you?

475
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,830
Did you get it?

476
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,956
Tried.

477
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,749
What happened?

478
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,711
One of the security thingies went off
and I got busted for shoplifting.

479
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,922
But I told you to take
the security tags off.

480
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,841
I did.

481
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,635
Must have missed one.

482
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,685
It's okay.

483
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,691
Did you, uh...
Did you say anything about me?

484
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,151
- No.
- You sure? You sure?

485
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,153
'Cause you can tell me.
Just tell me.

486
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,237
I didn't.

487
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:35,870
Ramsey, we need this money.
Your mom won't ask, but we need it.

488
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,413
How bad does she need it?

489
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,084
I told you, it ain't for us.

490
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:43,919
Look at me.

491
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,631
I come back from two back-to-back
tours in Iraq last year,

492
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,341
and I got shit.

493
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,260
No job, no degree,
no money... nothin'.

494
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:55,348
All I have is respect,
and from you I'm gonna get respect.

495
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,392
I asked you to do one thing,

496
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,354
one stupid little thing...

497
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,398
and you messed it up.

498
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:07,151
What's this?
Where'd you get this?

499
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,988
- A friend.
- Nice friend?

500
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,366
Yeah.

501
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,956
I wonder what you have to do for
a friend to get a phone like this.

502
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,178
Don't mess up again.

503
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,358
Your call has been forwarded

504
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,360
to an automatic
voice-message system.

505
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,238
Six-1-2-8-4-5-4.

506
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,141
Would anyone like some more wine?

507
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,934
- Yeah.
- I would.

508
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,270
Your uncle and I are very happy

509
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:27,523
to have a belated Christmas dinner
with the newlyweds.

510
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,442
We're all glad you're here.

511
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,111
Too bad your brother had to fly

512
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,196
straight back to Wilmington
from Phoenix.

513
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:37,867
Helen, you should see
the house he bought.

514
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:41,912
Oh, John's work
is just going so well.

515
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,206
His company
is exploiting Chinese children

516
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,291
into making automotive paint.

517
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,084
Here we go
with all the green talk again.

518
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:50,880
We are proud of you too,
being a teacher.

519
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:53,549
Why would...
That's not what I'm...

520
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,676
Could somebody
please pass the Mrs. Dash?

521
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,304
She might be hiding
with Mr. Dash.

522
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:01,015
Oh, we don't know if there
is a Mr. Dash, Dad.

523
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,643
Maybe things didn't go well
after their wedding or something.

524
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,104
Well, maybe Mr. Dash
had some things on his mind,

525
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,857
and things he had
to take care of.

526
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,026
I just wonder if Mr. and Mrs. Dash
didn't go on a honeymoon

527
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,694
and then after that
stopped communicating.

528
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,529
Maybe Mrs. Dash should stop
feeling sorry for herself.

529
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,324
I think that Mrs. Dash
is trying really hard

530
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,576
- and maybe feels underappreciated.
- Maybe Mrs. Dash should remember

531
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,995
she's not the only spice
in the spice rack.

532
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,039
I'm not saying that Mrs. Dash
is the only spice.

533
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,292
Mrs. Dash has gotten very arrogant
lately. Little one-sided.

534
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,252
- Arrogant?
- Mm-hmm.

535
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:33,088
There's paprika, there's thyme,
there's rosem... lot of other spices.

536
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,966
I think maybe it's time
to clear the table.

537
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,719
- I'll help you.
- No, no, Helen. Now, you sit.

538
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:42,389
I only get to wash
the Christmas dishes once a year.

539
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,058
Okay, this is it.

540
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,567
We couldn't believe all those
strange-looking plants in Phoenix.

541
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,236
What were they called again?

542
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,279
Cactus, Helen.
They were cactus.

543
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,532
They weren't cactus.
I know what cactus look like.

544
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,784
They're succulents.

545
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,832
Too bad about your...
your friend, Scott.

546
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,960
Yeah. I'm sorry.
That's too bad.

547
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,547
It was an unfortunate lesson
for all of us.

548
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,924
Boy looked like
he was a lot of fun.

549
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,677
He was a lot of fun, Roger.

550
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,136
He wasn't a boy though.

551
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:24,098
- He was a man.
- Of course he was a man.

552
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,350
No, no, no.
He was a real man.

553
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,477
Just because he drank
a little too much

554
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,646
and quit law school
and he got fired from his job,

555
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,275
it doesn't make him less of a man.
'Cause he was a man, Kris.

556
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,111
Okay. We understand
and we know you're upset...

557
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,654
You asked me to pee
sitting down!

558
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,073
I thought it would be
a nice compromise.

559
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,783
You wanted me to carry a purse,
for Christ's sake.

560
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,828
- Why would he carry a purse?
- It was a man bag!

561
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,706
And I was only pointing out that
some men have found it efficient.

562
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,374
- They are in Europe, mostly...
- We don't live in Europe.

563
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:54,753
This is what I'm talking about.
Lumpy kept it real.

564
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,338
He was a man.

565
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:06,181
I'm going to help Mom
in the kitchen.

566
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,225
Good idea.

567
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:12,980
Come on, Terry. This isn't even
gonna get me through New Years.

568
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,190
Man, Terry! Hey.

569
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,252
What?

570
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:36,962
Nothing.

571
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,977
Your aunt had to bring up Lumpy.

572
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:55,564
Mom, someone died.
People are gonna talk about it.

573
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:58,025
But that's all they talk about.

574
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,612
Oh, your best man got drunk
and died at the wedding.

575
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,406
Do you know that he hit
on your cousin Lindsay?

576
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:07,409
She's 14.
They were just dancing.

577
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,746
I think it's inappropriate.
I don't like it.

578
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,209
Well, don't tell me
that you don't wish

579
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,586
that it didn't happen
on your wedding night.

580
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,428
Actually, I just wish
that it didn't happen.

581
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,026
- Oh. Hey.
- I'm sorry. You're not a smoker.

582
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,948
Should we leave tomorrow morning
after traffic?

583
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,825
- Leave for where?
- Lutsen.

584
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,536
What are you talking about?
Why would we drive to Lutsen?

585
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,079
'Cause we have to
find Ramsey Anderson

586
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,872
and tell her that
her boyfriend died.

587
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,086
Kris, that's like five hours away.
It's near Canada.

588
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,546
Why don't we just
call Ramsey Anderson?

589
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,258
I tried. The phone's
been disconnected or something.

590
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,260
I Googled. I Facebooked.
There's nothing.

591
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,386
What about a home number?

592
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,723
Do you know how many Andersons
there are in Northern Minnesota?

593
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,308
So we're gonna drive to Lutsen

594
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,519
and just ask around
for Ramsey Anderson?

595
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,647
- Yeah.
- Why would we do that?

596
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:21,316
Because Lumpy
was your best friend.

597
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,293
Kris, can you take
your legs down, please?

598
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,962
'Cause we get in an accident,
you're gonna get paralyzed.

599
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:46,341
But we've passed, like, two cars
in the last 20 minutes.

600
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,345
Can you just work with me, please?

601
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,806
Come on.
We're newlyweds.

602
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,813
Thank you.

603
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,776
I need to pee again.

604
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,320
Really?

605
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,491
Yeah.

606
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,248
Mom.

607
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,459
There's someone at the door.

608
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,883
Mom!

609
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,189
- Hey.
- Hi.

610
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,732
Hi. Uh, I'm sorry
to bother you.

611
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:46,360
Are your parents at home?

612
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:47,903
Yeah.

613
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,365
Great.

614
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,783
Can I talk to them?

615
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,952
Why?

616
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,787
Okay.

617
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,873
Uh, yeah, because I normally
cut through your neighbor's property

618
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,376
to get down to the lake,
but they have it plowed so...

619
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,837
Yeah, I think they took their
Winnebago to Florida for the winter.

620
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,421
Do you think it would be okay

621
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:09,424
if I just cut through
your property really quick?

622
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,385
- Yeah. Sure.
- Really?

623
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,012
- Rock it out.
- All right. Rock it out.

624
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,142
You like these guys, huh?

625
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:20,769
You know these guys?

626
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:23,981
Yeah, I do.
A lot of people do.

627
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,941
Not in this town.

628
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,734
Oh, no, maybe not.

629
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,403
Yeah. Probably right.

630
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,572
Okay, I'll get out of your hair.
Thank you.

631
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,870
Careful on the ice.

632
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,416
Global warming.

633
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,460
Thanks.

634
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,945
Who was that at the door?

635
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,825
- Who was that?
- Some guy.

636
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,744
- What guy?
- I don't know. He's gone.

637
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:21,455
Have you seen my cigarettes?

638
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,749
Finished the pack at school.

639
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,001
Don't be a smart-ass.

640
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:33,967
So, uh, how was school anyway?

641
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,222
I asked you a question.

642
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,018
What are you doing?

643
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,230
- I asked you how school was.
- How do you think it was? It sucks.

644
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,149
- Why?
- Why do you think?

645
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,318
I don't know, Ramsey.
That's why I'm asking.

646
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,778
I hate it here.

647
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,529
You never gave it a chance.

648
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,823
No one makes new friends
in high school.

649
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,951
Oh, you're so smart though.

650
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:01,161
Yeah, and everyone's
just dying to be friends

651
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,872
with that freak girl who does math
two years ahead of everybody else.

652
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:09,795
Well, if you try,
it'll get better.

653
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,296
You sure about that, Mom?

654
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,507
Is it gonna get better
like Milwaukee,

655
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,509
where I got beat up every week?

656
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,010
Or is it gonna get better
like Rockford,

657
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,470
where you got beat up every week?

658
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,680
Stop it.
I did the best that I could.

659
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:23,934
Or is it like Brooklyn Park,
where I had to watch my dad O.D.

660
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,143
- Stop it!
- So tell me, Mom,

661
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,521
when does it get better,
because I wouldn't want to miss it.

662
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,734
Ramsey.

663
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,821
- Where are you going?
- Anywhere but here.

664
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,470
- Hey.
- Hey.

665
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,306
Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

666
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,932
You didn't.

667
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,642
Good.

668
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,607
- How's it going?
- Good.

669
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,443
Just, uh, you know,
gettin' started.

670
00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:00,280
I just wanted to make sure
you found it.

671
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,741
The lake?

672
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,910
Yeah.

673
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:07,120
Yeah. Found it.

674
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,664
It's right there.

675
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,875
Cool.

676
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,672
- See ya.
- See ya.

677
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,179
Oh.

678
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,724
Oh, yeah. Okay.

679
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,311
Oh... Oh!

680
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:16,356
Oh!
Oh, look at you!

681
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:19,234
Ohh! Oh!

682
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:24,781
Oh.

683
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:27,581
Oh, shit.

684
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:31,606
Oh, shit.

685
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,445
Oh, God!

686
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,865
Help! Help!

687
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:39,481
Hold on!

688
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,419
Come on!
You're almost there!

689
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:12,889
I told you.

690
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:15,684
Global warming.

691
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,936
Oh, shit.

692
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,400
It's a wintry mess here...

693
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,402
I still think you should've
gone to the hospital.

694
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,445
Mm-mmm. No, no.

695
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:30,323
No, Duluth is, like,
two hours away from here.

696
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,367
I took a hot shower.
I'll be fine.

697
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,954
Well, you look purple
and bloated.

698
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:38,498
I always look bloated.

699
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,420
It's okay, it's okay.

700
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:46,131
I work really hard
to look this bloated.

701
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:48,216
It's a point of pride for me.

702
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:49,551
Good evening.
I'm Michelle Lee.

703
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,387
Mother Nature is once again
trying to put a damper on...

704
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,556
Do you mind if I shower?

705
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,851
- You want to take a shower here?
- I was on the ice too.

706
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,145
- Remember?
- I do. I do. Yeah. Yeah.

707
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:03,231
Uh, yeah.
Knock yourself out.

708
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:07,235
Um...

709
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,655
I think I should probably take you
home after that though. Okay?

710
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,867
Are you sure?

711
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,910
Uh, what would, uh...

712
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:18,788
What would your family say
if they saw you here with me?

713
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:21,458
We're not doing anything wrong.

714
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:25,670
I just think that it would
probably be the right choice.

715
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:28,423
Okay?

716
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,634
Like it was the right choice
for me to risk my life

717
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,260
saving a total stranger?

718
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:36,306
I thanked you for that, like,
a hundred times. Didn't I? I mean...

719
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,807
I just, uh...

720
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,435
You want me to get out of here
'cause you got what you needed.

721
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,646
- What?
- That's real fuckin' nice.

722
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,106
Hey, you don't even know me, okay?

723
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,150
A-And watch your mouth,
young lady.

724
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,861
I know you. I know men.
You want money.

725
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,571
You want sex. You want drugs.

726
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,949
Whoa... What?
Wh-What are you talking... Hold on.

727
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:57,369
I was just simply saying that
I think maybe you should...

728
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,454
Get the hell out of here!
I heard you.

729
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,707
Maybe if I get home in time, I can
still score some pharmaceuticals

730
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:04,250
for my mom's boyfriend

731
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:07,837
and we can all do some meth together
and watch cartoons.

732
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:13,259
From the direction
of Eau Claire City...

733
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,807
Hey, stop! Stop!
Hey, hey, hey!

734
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,475
God bless America!
Stop!

735
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,061
- You're gonna get pneumonia.
- I-I-I'm really sorry.

736
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,855
I'm really, really sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

737
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,107
Okay? Genuinely.

738
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:30,318
All right, listen. Just, uh,
you know, come back inside.

739
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:33,321
Let me at least put some clothes on
and I will drive you home.

740
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:34,698
I can walk.

741
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,909
Get your butt back in the hotel
room, or I'm gonna drop this towel!

742
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,371
You'll be scarred for life.

743
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,714
Good choice.

744
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,924
Smart choice. Oh!

745
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,593
Let me in.

746
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:05,228
Now, the state patrol, as well as
local law enforcement agencies,

747
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,688
are stepping up their...

748
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:10,650
And, uh, you know,
I was gonna be a big-shot lawyer.

749
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:13,987
I was gonna be,
you know, rich, have a...

750
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,448
A house on the lake,

751
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:20,243
and a different car for the winter,
a different one for the summer.

752
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:24,998
But everything just... fell apart.

753
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,002
Rough.

754
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,503
Yeah.

755
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,758
Anyway, uh...

756
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:38,136
So, you, uh... you guys
just moved here, yeah?

757
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,765
Me and my mom move around a lot.
I'm gettin' out of here though.

758
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,099
You are? On your own?

759
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:45,310
I'm filing for emancipation
this summer.

760
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:48,021
- I'm gonna get my G.E.D., and...
- Whoa.

761
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,482
I got a 1990
on my S.A.T.'s.

762
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,859
No, you didn't.
They only go up to 1600.

763
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,652
They changed it.

764
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:58,031
They changed it.
Nobody ever tells me anything.

765
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,333
So, um...

766
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,419
what college you gonna go to?

767
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,964
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

768
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,050
You gotta go to college.

769
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,302
It's sort of expensive.

770
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,262
Yeah.

771
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:24,557
- Open up. Cook County Sheriff.
- What? No. No way.

772
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:27,435
- Oh, my God. Put your shoes on.
- Wait...

773
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:30,647
- Ho! Whoa!
- On the floor.

774
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,273
Okay, okay. Okay.

775
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,109
Okay.

776
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:47,163
We should stop and ask.

777
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:51,459
This is why we should have gotten
a G.P.S. Take you right there.

778
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:55,338
Hey.
"Lutsen, 25 miles."

779
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,131
All right.

780
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:04,931
Yeah?

781
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,850
- Hi. Miss Anderson?
- Maybe.

782
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,936
I'm Scott Thomas.
This is my wife Kristin.

783
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,145
We're friends of Lumpy's.

784
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,314
Hi.

785
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:16,150
W-We have bad news, I'm afraid.

786
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:17,944
Who's Lumpy?

787
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,405
Aren't you Ramsey Anderson?

788
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,323
No, that's my daughter.

789
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,992
Your daughter?

790
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,995
- Is she home?
- How old is your daughter?

791
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:29,956
Um, look, I don't know
who you people are, but...

792
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,376
- You're friends of Lumpy's?
- Who is Lumpy?

793
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,794
Mom, it's cool.

794
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:37,005
You know these people?

795
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,716
Sort of, yes.

796
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,968
Fine.
I gotta go to work.

797
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:50,518
I'm sorry about that.
She's tired.

798
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:53,605
- You guys can come in.
- Thanks.

799
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:01,237
Um...

800
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:04,365
I'm afraid we have
some bad news, Ramsey.

801
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,578
Lumpy passed away this week.

802
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,706
There was an accident
at our wedding, and it was...

803
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,250
It was very sudden for everyone.

804
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:16,711
So we wanted to tell you.

805
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,129
What happened?

806
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,924
Well, he, uh...

807
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:24,344
He fell in the desert.
He fell and he hit his head.

808
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,764
And he... he died.

809
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,933
We don't know what, exactly,

810
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:34,145
your relationship was with Lumpy.

811
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:37,315
It's none of our business, so...

812
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:40,652
No, but we want you to know
that you can talk to us.

813
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,159
I should probably get going
actually, if that's cool.

814
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,119
- Oh.
- Sorry.

815
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,663
Okay.

816
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:54,207
Well, would you like the details
for the funeral service?

817
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,834
'Cause it's gonna be Monday
in Minneapolis and...

818
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,419
That's okay.

819
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:01,923
- Okay.
- Okay.

820
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,927
Okay.
Um...

821
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:13,101
Sorry you guys had to
drive all the way up here.

822
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:16,980
I'm just glad we were able
to tell you.

823
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,025
Nice to meet you.

824
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:34,247
- What was that?
- I don't know.

825
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,583
She acted like
she didn't even know him.

826
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,752
They're gone?

827
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:43,297
Yeah. It was just
a misunderstanding.

828
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:50,263
Danny gets all bent out of shape
if I'm five minutes late.

829
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,307
If you see Winston,
tell him I'll be off at 1:00.

830
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:57,729
Is everything all right?

831
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,690
Yeah, I'm fine.

832
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,249
Smile.

833
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,959
Hmm?

834
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:25,173
You never smile.

835
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,345
Can't we just
drive back tonight?

836
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,722
Oh, come on.
Please, no.

837
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:16,933
It's so cold.
I'm tired.

838
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,936
Let's just order a pizza
and crash here.

839
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,021
It just seems like
a waste of money.

840
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,981
Waste of money?

841
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:27,527
It's, like, 39 bucks a night.

842
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,612
Think we can still swing that.

843
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,906
Mmm.

844
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:42,041
What are you doing?

845
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,502
I'm gonna check for bedbugs.

846
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:52,552
Um...

847
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,474
I quit my job.

848
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,686
- What?
- Yeah.

849
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,021
Quit. Done.
Quit my job.

850
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:08,442
Rick wouldn't give me
the commission yet again,

851
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:10,444
so I finally called his dad...

852
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:12,446
Please tell me
that you're joking.

853
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:14,073
Nope.

854
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:18,536
And, uh, Rick Senior tells me
that I'm not a team player.

855
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,873
You quit your job now?

856
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,875
Why are you saying it like that?

857
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:25,751
You're the one
that said they were crooks.

858
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:28,129
Yeah, they are, but I didn't
say "quit your job."

859
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,298
We have a wedding to pay for!

860
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:34,218
Well, you're the one
that bought a $2,000 dress.

861
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:36,429
It was 3,000.

862
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,140
Oh, Jesus, Kris.

863
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,267
- Oh, my God.
- You have to get your job back.

864
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,478
I can't get my job back!
I don't want to get my job back!

865
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,315
Keep shafting me
on commissions, and I'm done.

866
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,692
That's what Lumpy
would have done.

867
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,695
Oh, well, by all means
let's follow Lumpy's example.

868
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,114
What has he done?
He dropped out of law school.

869
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:56,824
He got fired for embezzlement.

870
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:58,826
Now I think he's committed
statutory rape!

871
00:58:58,911 --> 00:59:01,746
Stop it! Please don't.
Just don't.

872
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,880
You know how we could
afford Mexico?

873
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,508
Lumpy gave me the money.

874
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:17,511
He got us a honeymoon,

875
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:20,514
and I can't even
get his funeral right.

876
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,643
You never told me that.

877
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,521
He asked me not to tell you.

878
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:36,948
- Wh-Where are you going?
- I'm gonna find us some food.

879
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:45,539
I don't care.

880
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,146
Get away!

881
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:11,983
Stop!

882
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,655
Ow. Ow!
My hand's burning.

883
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,824
Ow!

884
01:00:21,994 --> 01:00:24,578
What'd you do? Oh!

885
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:29,250
Ramsey. No.
Not in front of her, no.

886
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,877
I'm... Hey!
It's okay, baby.

887
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,338
- Not in front of my little girl!
- Calm down.

888
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:37,383
Why... Get out of here!
Get out!

889
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:42,972
I don't want her
to see. I don't want her to see.

890
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,057
It's all right.

891
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,797
Where'd you get muffins in Lutsen?

892
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:19,342
They're just Hostess cupcakes.

893
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,762
Well, it's still
a pretty good effort.

894
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:27,808
I'm sorry. I am so sorry
about the honeymoon and the job.

895
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:29,977
No. No.

896
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:33,356
I should be apologizing to you.

897
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,316
You did the right thing.

898
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,612
I promise you
we're gonna have a honeymoon.

899
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,615
We're gonna have a...
a great honeymoon.

900
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,450
I know.

901
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,457
I need a ride.

902
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,794
To the funeral.
Can I go with you guys?

903
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:58,547
Uh, sure.

904
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,508
Yeah, we can drive you
to Minneapolis.

905
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:03,177
But how you gonna get back home?

906
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:06,263
I don't know.
I'd take the bus or something?

907
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:08,849
I think we should
figure that out before...

908
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,142
- Yeah...
- I'm pregnant.

909
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,106
It's Lumpy's.

910
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,526
I knew it.

911
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,654
I have to go to the funeral.
Lumpy would have wanted me...

912
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:26,158
I mean, us to be there.

913
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,416
- Why can't we just leave?
- Because that would be kidnapping.

914
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,919
- So we're gonna ask your mom.
- Remember our deal.

915
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,422
Yeah, I won't say anything about
the pregnancy to your mom.

916
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:41,674
And I won't mention it
at the funeral.

917
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,467
Perfect.

918
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,684
- Mom.
- Hi again.

919
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,686
- They shouldn't be here.
- Mom, it's okay.

920
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,939
We just came to ask if we could
take Ramsey to Minneapolis.

921
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,067
- What's he talking about?
- It's for the funeral.

922
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:03,279
No one is taking
my daughter anywhere.

923
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:04,613
It's for Lumpy.

924
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:07,032
I don't care what it's for.
I don't even know you.

925
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:08,826
We're friends of...

926
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,870
Friends of a mutual friend, Lumpy.

927
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:13,164
Yeah? Lumpy?

928
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,625
You were going, uh...

929
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,545
Going off with some Lumpy guy?

930
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,714
- Where did you find those?
- Doesn't matter.

931
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,799
You went through my room
and dug through my stuff.

932
01:03:23,884 --> 01:03:28,721
I'm your mother! I can go through
what the... the hell I want to!

933
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,515
Who'd you bring in this house?
This about last night?

934
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,809
No, listen,
everything's totally cool.

935
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:36,520
We just came here to ask you guys
if we could take Ramsey

936
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:38,606
to a funeral for our friend Lumpy.

937
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:39,899
Who?

938
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,526
- Let's just... We should go.
- No. I'm coming with you.

939
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:44,737
Yeah, listen. I'm just trying
to respect the wishes

940
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:48,574
- of a friend who passed away.
- I don't care what you're doing.

941
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:49,950
- Get the hell out of here.
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

942
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,161
- We gotta go.
- Baby, what are you doing?

943
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,871
Social Services.
That what this is?

944
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:55,498
No! Oh, no, no, no.

945
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:57,750
He's in real estate.
I'm a third grade teacher.

946
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,335
Yeah.

947
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:01,378
Wh-Where did you get that?

948
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:04,840
I promise you, there's no reason
for that, okay? E-Everything's fine.

949
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:08,302
We just... We have a mutual friend
who passed away.

950
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,762
We're just going to a funeral.
That's it.

951
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,681
- I told you to leave!
- Okay.

952
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:14,767
Okay. We'll go.

953
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,811
Baby, it's okay.

954
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,981
Maybe they're right. Maybe Ramsey
should go to the funeral.

955
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,776
Ms. Shirley said that it was okay.

956
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,152
- Ms. Shirley?
- Yeah.

957
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:28,906
She said that maybe it's a good time
for you to start traveling.

958
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,408
You know, seeing other pl...
Hold on.

959
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:39,458
- How long you gonna be gone?
- I don't know.

960
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:41,627
Um, the funeral is tomorrow,

961
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:45,839
so we can put her on a bus
by Monday night, Tuesday morning.

962
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:49,552
Here.
I want you to have it.

963
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:54,723
I want you to know we're gonna
take really good care of her.

964
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,642
It's only for a couple days.
We'll have her back.

965
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,519
- Make sure.
- Yeah, we will.

966
01:04:58,603 --> 01:04:59,645
- We should go.
- Okay.

967
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,231
I'm sorry again about
all the confusion and, um...

968
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:05,150
I-I-I didn't catch your name.

969
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,238
Um, you know what?

970
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:12,533
I-I'm just gonna leave you
a business card there.

971
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:17,788
That's me and my cell number, if you
need to get in touch, check in.

972
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,206
Okay.

973
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,133
I love you.

974
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,443
Jesus.

975
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,404
It's only gonna be two days.

976
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:28,859
S-So, how often would Lumpy
come and visit you, Ramsey?

977
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,863
Almost every weekend.

978
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,865
Really?

979
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:38,619
And, um, your mom
never met him?

980
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:42,039
We hung out
at the motel mostly.

981
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,749
Huh.

982
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:52,925
So, you guys just got married
four days ago?

983
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,302
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

984
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:57,638
Aren't you supposed to be
on your honeymoon or something?

985
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:58,722
Mmm.

986
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,934
Yeah, supposed to be...

987
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:05,104
Lying under a palm tree
in a caftan, sipping a mojito.

988
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:07,981
What's a caftan?

989
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:12,695
Never mind.

990
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:15,864
So...

991
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,408
No honeymoon.

992
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:19,952
- Nope.
- Hmm.

993
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,995
Waste of a perfectly good
boob job.

994
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,998
You got a boob job?

995
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:28,669
- No, I did not, Ramsey.
- I was just kidding.

996
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,421
I didn't think so.

997
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,553
I need a Xanax.

998
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:39,972
- Again?
- What do you mean? "Again"?

999
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,182
What do you mean, "again"?

1000
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:45,227
- You took one earlier.
- Yeah.

1001
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:46,729
- Did I?
- You did.

1002
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:49,314
My mom says taking drugs
for fun is okay,

1003
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,984
but taking them for problems is not.

1004
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,154
'Cause once the drugs wear off,
you still have the problem.

1005
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:56,989
Yeah.

1006
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,494
Why'd you quit your job?

1007
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:05,748
Wh... Huh?
Why'd I qui...

1008
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:07,332
Oh.

1009
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:10,002
It's a long story, Ramsey.

1010
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,004
Hmm.

1011
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,673
We got two hours
till Minneapolis.

1012
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:20,888
Yeah.

1013
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,145
Pop'll kill you.

1014
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:31,273
We have green tea.

1015
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:40,073
Ever had goji berries?

1016
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,246
Oh.

1017
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,124
Well, they're filled
with antioxidants.

1018
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:52,503
Well, I'm 15.
I don't need antioxidants.

1019
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:58,050
That's Lumpy's
ultimate fighting phase.

1020
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,345
- Lumpy fought?
- Mmm.

1021
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,555
Only with Jim Beam.

1022
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:08,644
Hey, is this picture
from the Wisconsin Dells truck?

1023
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,312
Yeah.
How'd you know that?

1024
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:13,732
He talked about you guys
all the time.

1025
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,782
- What's wrong?
- That was the coroner.

1026
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,368
Uh, apparently Lumpy
didn't bleed to death.

1027
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:27,371
- He had a heart failure.
- What?

1028
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:30,332
Yeah. It had nothing
to do with the cactus.

1029
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,670
- He had a heart attack?
- He had a heart attack.

1030
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:37,256
The coroner said
it was like, um,

1031
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:40,843
you know, when young athletes
just collapse on the field.

1032
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:44,763
Did you know that Lumpy
had a heart condition?

1033
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:46,890
I don't think Lumpy knew
he had a heart condition.

1034
01:09:46,975 --> 01:09:48,350
He knew.

1035
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:53,146
He knew about his heart.
He had I.H.S.S.

1036
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:54,773
How do you know?

1037
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:56,275
He told me.

1038
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:57,776
What's I.H.S.S.?

1039
01:09:57,861 --> 01:10:01,655
Uh, idiopathic hyper...

1040
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:05,617
Something-something.
It's pretty rare, probably genetic.

1041
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,121
So Lumpy told you
he had a heart defect?

1042
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,623
I just said that.

1043
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,459
What else did he tell you?

1044
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:18,338
- Lots of things.
- Yeah? Like what?

1045
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:21,133
- Like, why do you care?
- I-I-I'll tell you why.

1046
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:24,636
Because I don't know what he's doing,
where he's working, who he's dating.

1047
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,847
I don't really know anything
about the guy, as it turns out.

1048
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,724
- Neither do I.
- Oh, n...

1049
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:30,976
I think you knew him
pretty well, actually.

1050
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,853
Did Lumpy know about the baby?

1051
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,563
- Scott...
- No, no, no. Did he?

1052
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:38,525
- Did Lumpy know about the baby?
- I don't know!

1053
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:42,112
You don't know if you told your
own boyfriend you were pregnant?

1054
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:49,077
I mean, what the hell?
What if she got pregnant on purpose?

1055
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:50,162
She's just a girl.

1056
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,538
What if that made
his heart thing worse?

1057
01:10:51,623 --> 01:10:53,165
- It doesn't matter.
- Of course it matters!

1058
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:56,752
- What are you talking about?
- He's gone, Scott.

1059
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:00,047
I know that. I just...

1060
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:05,844
He told a 15-year-old girl
he was dying. He didn't tell me.

1061
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:10,807
I just wish he'd told me.

1062
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,611
Oh, I wish he had told me.

1063
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:45,509
You told me you would never
involve her in the drugs.

1064
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:48,261
You promised.

1065
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:52,599
We all make our sacrifices.

1066
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:54,267
Yeah.

1067
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:58,438
You know what I think?
I think she got caught on purpose.

1068
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:02,025
And I'm gonna have a little talk
with her when she gets back.

1069
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:00,268
- Scott.
- Hi, Gail.

1070
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:02,854
I am so sorry.
So sorry.

1071
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,232
- He was just way too young.
- He was.

1072
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:06,817
- Hey, Roger.
- Hi, Scott.

1073
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,068
Uh, I gotta...

1074
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:11,988
So, don't you look pretty.

1075
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:15,033
I like your hair like that.

1076
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:18,495
- Have you taken any pills today?
- What?

1077
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:23,250
Well, your father and I
are very worried about you and drugs.

1078
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:24,626
Oh, my God.

1079
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,379
- Honey, we love you very much.
- Yes, we do.

1080
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:30,173
My God.
This is about Neil on the plane?

1081
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:34,678
Yes, Neil did say something to his
mother, and he's only trying to help.

1082
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:35,762
This is so ridiculous.

1083
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:38,515
I thank the Lord
that he did say something.

1084
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:41,309
Because otherwise I wouldn't know
that you have a problem.

1085
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:43,436
- I don't have a problem!
- Honey, a-all right.

1086
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:46,022
- Don't get excited.
- We're gonna talk about this later.

1087
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,524
- Yeah, that's good.
- That's right.

1088
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:50,026
- We'll talk about it later.
- Please go sit down.

1089
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:52,529
- Just no drugs today.
-  Mother!

1090
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,407
Honey.

1091
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:56,950
What is going on?

1092
01:14:57,034 --> 01:15:00,537
I... I can't talk about it.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1093
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,414
Okay.

1094
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:52,130
My name is Ramsey Anderson.

1095
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:55,467
I know a lot of you probably don't
know who I am or how I knew Lumpy.

1096
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:56,968
Oh, God.

1097
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,095
It's sort of a long story.

1098
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:02,766
Lumpy had a minor heart attack
a year and a half ago.

1099
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,561
And the doctors told him
there was no way to know for sure,

1100
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:09,606
but they didn't think he would live
more than a year or two.

1101
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:12,609
He had I.H.S.S.
It's a heart defect,

1102
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:16,488
which means the walls of his heart
were hard and thick.

1103
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:20,283
And knowing Lumpy,
that's difficult for me to believe.

1104
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,745
He didn't tell anyone
about his heart

1105
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,623
because he didn't want
his friends or family to worry.

1106
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:29,042
And if he only had
a little time left to live,

1107
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:31,920
the last thing he wanted to be
was a lawyer.

1108
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:35,715
He just wanted to fish
and have fun.

1109
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,427
But then he met me.

1110
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:45,892
What's this?
My last rites already?

1111
01:16:45,977 --> 01:16:48,520
We're dropping the charges.

1112
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,522
The girl told us what happened.

1113
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,899
We went out to the lake,
saw where you fell through.

1114
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:53,984
You're lucky.

1115
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:57,570
Lumpy started visiting me,
um, twice a month,

1116
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:00,031
and then every week.

1117
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:03,535
And he'd come up and I'd do
my homework in his motel room,

1118
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,579
or we'd go fishing.

1119
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,418
It was fun.

1120
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:14,587
It was always fun with Lumpy.

1121
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:17,465
I know this sounds weird,

1122
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:20,552
but he was the first real friend
I ever had.

1123
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,557
But when things got worse
for me at home,

1124
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,892
he decided he had to do something.

1125
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:30,895
So you want Ramsey
to move to Minneapolis with you?

1126
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,522
Yeah. Why not?

1127
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:34,774
She could start at the "U"
a year early.

1128
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:37,444
She aced her S.A.T.,
and she gets good grades.

1129
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:38,945
She's also 15 years old.

1130
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:42,574
Yeah. And you know
what's going on inside that house.

1131
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,534
She's gotta get out.

1132
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:47,120
You might be right,
but you're not her parent.

1133
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:51,750
Then help us convince her mother
that it's the best thing for Ramsey.

1134
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:53,752
What if something happens to you?

1135
01:17:55,046 --> 01:17:57,422
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

1136
01:17:58,466 --> 01:18:00,216
You sure this is what you want?

1137
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:03,678
Yeah.

1138
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:06,181
I want to leave.

1139
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:13,980
But we never got to
that part of the plan.

1140
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:19,319
There are a lot of moments in life,

1141
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:21,780
and I didn't know Lumpy
very long.

1142
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:25,075
Most of you probably had more time
with him than I did,

1143
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:28,995
but just because dying on a cactus
was Lumpy's last moment

1144
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,165
doesn't mean it was
his most important one.

1145
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:40,757
I loved my friend
and the moments we had.

1146
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:44,844
I loved Lumpy.

1147
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,882
That was really good,
what you said in there.

1148
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:27,595
And I know Lumpy
would have liked it.

1149
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:35,520
When I yelled at you yesterday,
that wasn't about you.

1150
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,773
But I had no right to do that,
and I'm... I'm very sorry.

1151
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:41,484
I've been yelled at
a lot worse.

1152
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:44,571
That doesn't really
make me feel better.

1153
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:49,159
I'm not pregnant.

1154
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:52,412
Yeah, I kinda figured that out.

1155
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,831
Lumpy was a great guy.
He never would have...

1156
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:56,916
I know. I know.

1157
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:03,047
What's he doing here?

1158
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:05,967
Rick?
You know Rick?

1159
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,553
That's Rick?

1160
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:11,139
Rick the Realtor Rick?
The one that took your commission?

1161
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:12,765
Yeah. But...

1162
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,310
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'll be right back.

1163
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:16,769
Hey.

1164
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:19,564
- Hey.
- Hey.

1165
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,567
Can I talk to you
about a friend of mine?

1166
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,652
He's like a father to me.

1167
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:34,787
Jaime!

1168
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:39,250
I had to wait
45 minutes out there.

1169
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:45,215
Jaime?

1170
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:23,086
I wanted to tell you
I'm really sorry about your son.

1171
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:24,796
Thank you.

1172
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:28,383
I have something for you.

1173
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,803
When I went to
Lumpy's apartment,

1174
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,472
I found this with your name on it.

1175
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:38,977
This is your money.

1176
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:42,188
It's an advance to help
with your transition to Minneapolis.

1177
01:21:42,273 --> 01:21:44,816
I put the rest
in a safe deposit box.

1178
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,442
Why are you doing this?

1179
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:50,154
If Lumpy wanted you to start college
early, that's what you should do.

1180
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,198
You'll probably have to get
a part-time job,

1181
01:21:52,283 --> 01:21:55,368
but that should go a long way
towards tuition.

1182
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:57,370
I don't know what to say.

1183
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:00,665
You know, I always felt bad

1184
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,793
my son never met anyone to love,

1185
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:06,754
someone to love him back.

1186
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:10,425
It's really good to know
that I was wrong.

1187
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:58,431
- Hon.
- Oh.

1188
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,311
What is this?
Looks like a wedding gift?

1189
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:05,438
I don't know.
Just came today.

1190
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:06,939
Open it.

1191
01:23:12,946 --> 01:23:16,115
"Knew you always wanted one of these.
Love, Lumpy."

1192
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:23,247
It's a robe.
He knew you always wanted a robe?

1193
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:25,124
It's not a robe.

1194
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:27,627
- Looks like a robe.
- What is it?

1195
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:32,256
It's a caftan.

1196
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,013
It's... It's a caftan.

1197
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,645
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's good.

1198
01:23:47,398 --> 01:23:50,942
Uh, I guess I should
find my way home.

1199
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:54,028
Is there a bus station
around here somewhere?

1200
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:56,656
Uh, your mom
called this morning.

1201
01:23:57,908 --> 01:23:59,075
She did?

1202
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:03,454
Yeah. She left Lutsen.

1203
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:06,874
She's left a lot of towns.

1204
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:14,173
You know, I...

1205
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:19,971
I-I honestly think
this is good for her.

1206
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:22,390
I-I think it's good for you too.

1207
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:24,976
Anyway, I know
she wants to get help.

1208
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,437
Where is she?

1209
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:29,021
I don't know.

1210
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:35,570
We're gonna figure this out.

1211
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:38,740
- Where am I supposed to go?
- You stay here for now.

1212
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:40,992
- With you?
- Yeah.

1213
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:44,078
You guys just got married.
You don't want me here.

1214
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:46,914
We talked about it, okay?

1215
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:48,916
Stay here.

1216
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:51,669
- For how long?
- For as long as it takes.

1217
01:24:57,968 --> 01:25:00,720
Lumpy had good taste in friends.

1218
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:05,433
Besides, I think I owe you one.
I don't know what you said to Rick.

1219
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:08,978
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

1220
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,897
"Nothing" got me my job back?

1221
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:16,444
I just promised
I'd help him out with something.

1222
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:18,696
Oh, God. What?

1223
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:21,783
You know what?
I don't want to know, do I?

1224
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:25,036
- Probably not.
-  Okay.

1225
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,872
Well, we'll table it.

1226
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,416
- You hungry?
- Starving.

1227
01:25:30,501 --> 01:25:32,084
Come on.

1228
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,087
- Hello.
- Hi.
