(Gunshot)

5
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:10,367
(Man)
OK! I know how to handle your type.

6
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:18,957
(Thud)

7
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:57,702
Well, old faithful,
that's your shooting for the day.

8
00:03:58,122 --> 00:04:00,449
If we haven't rung up
at least two rabbits,

9
00:04:00,626 --> 00:04:03,329
we deserve to go home empty-handed.

10
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:07,582
Yeah, still, blessed are they
who expect nothing.

11
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:09,878
For they shall not be disappointed.

12
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:15,802
Mm. Fewer things in life give a man
more pleasure than hunting.

13
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,463
It satisfies his primitive nature,

14
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:22,556
striding through the woods,
picking up his kill.

15
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,100
Well, come on, old faithful.

16
00:04:25,272 --> 00:04:29,270
There's plump rabbits
waiting for the frying pan.

17
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,965
If this can had four legs and a tail,
we'd be eating it tonight.

18
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,792
Clean through the heart.

19
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:37,454
For rice cake! I've done him in.

20
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,702
Cor.

21
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:45,750
A harmless pot-shot at a rabbit
and I'm a murderer, a killer.

22
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:48,711
Mother always said
I'd come to a bad end.

23
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:51,556
What in Hades were you doing here
anyway?

24
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:56,726
I can't say that I've seen you
around here before.

25
00:05:56,894 --> 00:06:01,970
No. If you're going to get yourself
shot, do it where you're known.

26
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:04,223
(Birds Chirping)

27

28
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:16,741
87 Maple Avenue,
Boston, Massachusetts."

29
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,611
Worp, you're a long way from home.

30
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,658
With the looks of it, you won't
get back for Christmas, now.

31
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:28,708
We're going to have a cold,
hard winter.

32
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,498
Mm. You might keep here a long time,
an awful long time.

33
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:34,749
Too long for me, Harry.

34
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:36,884
Yes.

35
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:50,020
Captain Wiles?

36
00:06:51,273 --> 00:06:53,146
Yes, ma'am?

37
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,811
What seems to be the trouble,
Captain?

38
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:03,649
It's what you might call
an unavoidable accident.

39
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:07,278
- He's dead.
- Yes.

40
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:13,874
I would say that he was. Of course,
that's an unprofessional opinion.

41
00:07:14,043 --> 00:07:17,496
Yeah. Did you...
did you know him, Miss Gravely?

42
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:21,750
- No. Doesn't live around here.
- Well, he died around here.

43
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:24,962
- That's what counts now.
- Embarrassing.

44
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:28,837
What do you plan to do with him,
Captain?

45
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:34,008
Miss Gravely, without cutting the hem
off truth's garment,

46
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:37,305
I'm gonna hide him, cover him up,

47
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,555
forget him.

48
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:45,401
Are you never going to inform
the police, Captain?

49
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,021
No. Forget you saw me, Miss Gravely.

50
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,367
Chase it out of your mind, for
heaven's sake, it was an accident.

51
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:56,531
He was poking around the clearing
and I thought he was a rabbit.

52
00:07:56,705 --> 00:08:00,489
It was a human error.
Ah, now, please, don't...

53
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:04,002
Don't say anything to anybody,
Miss Gravely.

54
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:07,995
Do as you think best, Captain.

55
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:11,293
I'm sure you must have met
many similar situations

56
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:13,590
in your travels in foreign lands.

57
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:17,178
- Yeah, I've seen much worse things.
- I certainly won't say anything.

58
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:19,838
Much worse things.
I remember when I was on the Orinoco.

59
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:23,351
We had a Turk, a great, big Turk,
running amuck with a machete -

60
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,186
Captain, if I were going to hide
an accident, I shouldn't delay.

61
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:31,519
Oh. Oh.
You're right as rain, Miss Gravely.

62
00:08:31,693 --> 00:08:35,643
Yes. You know something?
I'm glad I met you today.

63
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:38,692
I feel better for telling someone
as warm,

64
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:42,859
tender, understanding as yourself.

65
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:47,200
Well, on the contrary, Captain. It...

66
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:49,496
It...

67
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,585
I'm certainly glad
if I helped you, Captain.

68
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:56,038
Perhaps you would care to come over
for some blueberry muffins

69
00:08:56,216 --> 00:08:59,002
and coffee later on,
high-bush blueberries?

70
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:02,048
Ah, well. This is certainly something
of an interesting surprise.

71
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:04,890
- And maybe some elderberry wine.
- Oh!

72
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:08,884
After all, we've been neighbours
for nearly three years now and...

73
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:11,135
we've never exchanged social calls.

74
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:14,184
You're right.
It's high time I paid a call.

75
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:17,973
- What time?
- Oh, say, early this afternoon.

76
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,983
I'll be there with a clean shirt
and a hungry face.

77
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:23,316
Do that.

78
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:28,324
You better be going now. Don't want
to be an accessory after the fact.

79
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:33,321
You are a considerate man,
Captain Wiles.

80
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,206
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

81
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:46,124
(Breathing Deeply)

82
00:09:49,262 --> 00:09:51,752
(Boy) We're almost there, Mommy!

83
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:05,681
Here he is, Mommy. Here he is.

84
00:10:07,903 --> 00:10:10,523
- What did I tell ya, Mommy?
- Don't touch it, Arnie.

85
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:15,488
- There he is.
- No. It can't be! Harry!

86
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,283
Harry, thank Providence,
the last of Harry.

87
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:23,908
- Who's Providence, Mommy?
- A very good friend.

88
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:26,325
- Don't you know who it is?
- You said Harry.

89
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:30,037
- Can't you remember, Arnie?
- Why don't he get up and move?

90
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:32,289
He's asleep.

91
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:36,001
He's in a deep sleep,
a deep, wonderful sleep.

92
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:38,253
How'd he hurt his head?

93
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,504
Putting it where it wasn't wanted,
would be my guess.

94
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,599
- Will it get better?
- Not if we're lucky.

95
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,888
Let's run home
and I'll make you some lemonade.

96
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:51,228
Will lemonade put me in a wonderful,
deep, deep sleep, Mommy?

97
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:53,476
No, Arnie, but it's better
than no lemonade.

98
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:57,398
- I don't understand that.
- Never mind. Forget you saw him.

99
00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:00,608
- Is there a special way to forget?
- Just think of something else.

100
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:04,483
- I'll try not to see him tomorrow.
- That's a good boy, Arnie.

101
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:07,578
Now, let's run home
and get that lemonade.

102
00:11:09,122 --> 00:11:11,958
She won't care what I do with him.

103
00:11:28,057 --> 00:11:30,427
Couldn't have had more people here
if I'd sold tickets.

104
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:33,937
What's the big attraction, I wonder?

105
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:04,461
This could turn out to be
the luckiest day of my life.

106
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,551
I'll just wait till the whole world
comes to pay their last respects.

107
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:21,975
Sooner or later one of them has
to turn out to be the Deputy Sheriff.

Hello, Mr Marlowe.

136
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:13,116
Wiggy, you haven't sold a painting.
All my pictures in the same place.

137
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:17,670
So few cars. They don't... I guess
the cider takes their attention.

138
00:15:17,838 --> 00:15:20,624
Cider, indeed.
Throw it away! Drink it.

139
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:23,919
- No, I hate cider.
- Not a picture sold.

140
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:27,428
I'm sorry, Mr Marlowe. Let's get
a look at your new one. Hold it up.

141
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,639
What good would it do? You don't
deserve to see it. How will I eat?

142
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:35,977
Mr Wiggs always used to thump
his stomach when he got mad.

143
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:38,221
He busted somethin' inside once.

144

(Cows mooing)

145
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:43,980
You think we'd do any better
on 5th Avenue?

146
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,230
If there's more people there.

147
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,689
Oh, lots of people. Hundreds
and thousands and billions of people.

148
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,536
- It might be better then.
- But what sort of people, Wiggy?

149
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,778
What breed? I'll tell you.

150
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:59,497
They're little people,
little people with hats on.

151
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,743
How are your cigarettes?

What does your son do with all those
old cars he always works on?

155
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:29,980
He sells 'em. Mechanical antiques.
Doesn't make much, needs the money.

156
00:16:33,654 --> 00:16:36,488
Hm. Doesn't he get paid
for being deputy sheriff?

157
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:39,906
Piecework.
Gets paid by the arrest, I think.

(Car Engine Revving)

159
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:45,615
Ah, Mr Marlowe, it's wonderful.

160

- I've been in a tortured mood.
- What is it?

161
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:55,829
Good old Wiggy, my sternest critic.

162
00:16:56,008 --> 00:17:00,421
I don't understand it but I think
it's beautiful. Mrs Rogers agrees.

163
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:02,801
- Oh? You talk about me?
- Well, I...

164
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:05,093
She's the pretty woman
with the little boy, isn't she?

165
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,472
Mm-hm.
I only brought up your name once

166
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:09,848
when we were talking
about strange people.

167
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:12,428
- Huh?
- That is, strangers.

168
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:14,810
- Oh.
- People she hadn't met yet.

169
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:17,556
What does the pretty,
little thing say about me?

170
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,810
Nothin'.

171
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:24,199
I think we better discuss business.
Here, my shopping list.

172
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:27,116
I'll go in and start puttin' it up.

173
00:17:31,622 --> 00:17:33,697
(Humming)

174
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:39,454
Wiggy, how do you spell Tuscaloosa?

175
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:41,871
Sam?

176
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:45,752
- Hi, Calvin.
- You hear any shootin'?

177
00:17:45,925 --> 00:17:47,883
- Nope.
- I did.

178
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:50,259
And there shouldn't be
any shootin' around here.

179
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:52,506
- Why?
- It's posted land, that's why.

180
00:17:53,016 --> 00:17:55,932
- Why's that?
- 'Cause I posted it.

181
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:59,767
What's wrong with people doing
shooting now and then? Let off steam.

182
00:17:59,938 --> 00:18:02,475
Bullets and guns are dangerous.
They kill things.

183
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:05,733
No one around here could hit
a freight car with a cannon.

184
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:10,236
I guess you're right, Sam.
All the same, the law's the law.

185
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:15,030
I got a mind to scout around to find
out who's shooting and level a fine.

186
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,692
And pick up a little piecework?

187
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:22,580
If I can do anything to make it
any harder for you, let me know.

188
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:37,252
(Horn Honking)

189
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:48,262
(Children Yelling)

190
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:53,391
(Dog Barking)

191
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:07,992
How'd you want your bacon,
Mr Marlowe?

192
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:11,781
- What were you saying?
- I asked how you want your bacon.

193
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,877
Sliced.
(Doorbells Jingling)

194
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:22,048
- Where is Calvin?
- Off somewheres unimportant.

195
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:26,345
(Breathing Deeply)
What a wonderful day.

196
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:29,217
So was yesterday, but you didn't say
anything to me about it.

197
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,598
What you want Calvin for?

198
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:34,437
These marvellous pictures.

199
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:36,974
Someone told me they were yours.

200
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:39,224
Why don't you sell them,
make a lot of money?

201
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,557
Never thought of it. I guess
I'll just have to think about it.

202
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:45,518
And that song. You sing it so
beautifully. You wrote it yourself?

203
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:47,771
What do you want to borrow?

204
00:19:47,947 --> 00:19:51,614
I think people need encouragement
sometimes, don't you, Mr Marlowe?

205
00:19:51,785 --> 00:19:54,905
- How'd you know my name?
- It's on the pictures, isn't it?

206
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:58,282
- It's not supposed to be readable.
- I can tell it's not supposed to be.

207
00:19:58,457 --> 00:20:01,625
They're very professional,
don't you think, Mrs Wiggs?

208
00:20:01,794 --> 00:20:05,540
Well, Miss Gravely,
all I know is nobody buys them.

209
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:08,583
Thank you for your encouragement,
Miss Gravely.

210
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:12,172
- Now I wonder how you know my name?
- Easy. Wiggy just said it.

211
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:15,713
Wiggy. What a perfectly ridiculous
little nickname.

212
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:18,094
Do you mind if I call you Wiggy,
Mrs Wiggs?

213
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:20,971
Not if you pay all your bills
on time.

214
00:20:21,144 --> 00:20:24,560
Alright, Mr Marlowe,
Bacon, beans, cabbage,

215
00:20:24,731 --> 00:20:28,394
sugar, salt, tea, oleomargarine.

216
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:31,568
- $1.95.
- And half a box of cigarettes.

217
00:20:31,737 --> 00:20:35,069
- Ah, yes. Ten cents, two five.
- That much?

218
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:39,821
I don't seem to be able to find...

219
00:20:39,992 --> 00:20:43,244
I know, Mr Marlowe, as soon as
we sell some of your paintings.

220
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:46,489
(Dog Barking)

221
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:50,782
Let me make my position clear -

222
00:20:50,961 --> 00:20:53,036
Shhh.

223
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,671
What do you think?

224
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:07,721
I think it'll hold coffee.

225
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,517
Will you try it, Mr Marlowe?

226
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,861
Put your finger through the handle,
please.

227
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:29,531
How about the size?
What about the handle?

228
00:21:29,704 --> 00:21:31,577
Hm?

229
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:34,832
I mean, does it fit?
Is it the right finger size?

230
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,157
It's my finger size.

231
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:48,089
- I'll take it.
- Fifteen cents.

232
00:21:48,261 --> 00:21:50,335
- And the saucer?
- Ten.

233
00:21:50,512 --> 00:21:54,297
- That seems a fair price.
- What's important about finger size?

234
00:21:54,475 --> 00:21:58,176
I wanted to be certain
it would fit a man.

235
00:21:58,354 --> 00:22:00,844
- A certain size man.
- A man?

236
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:04,890
A certain somebody is coming over
to my cottage this afternoon.

237
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:08,233
- Not really?
- For coffee and blueberry muffins.

238
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:10,562
Why, you old social butterfly, you.

239
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,149
Old?

240
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:14,314
That was figuratively speaking.

241
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:18,071
(Mrs Wiggs) I think we've got
a nearsighted cider customer.

242
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:20,654
(Miss Gravely)
How old do you think I am, young man?

243
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:25,408
Hmmm. Fifty.
How old do you think you are?

244
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:29,119
Forty-two. I can show you
my birth certificate.

245
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:33,509
You'll have to show more than your
birth certificate to convince a man.

246
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:36,380
- What do you mean?
- You have to show your character,

247
00:22:36,552 --> 00:22:39,803
the inner self, the hidden qualities,

248
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:42,888
the true Miss Gravely,
sensitive, young in feeling,

249
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:45,846
timeless with love and understanding.

250
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,931
I can do it!
At least, I think I can do it.

251
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:52,270
Do what?

252
00:22:52,442 --> 00:22:54,932
- I'll see what that gentleman -
- At a time like this?

253
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:57,317
- Where are your scissors?
- Outside.

254
00:22:57,489 --> 00:22:59,563
We're going to cut her hair.

255
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,698
- Hair?
- Cut it short.

256
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:05,033
Bring it up-to-date,
make a nice romantic styling,

257
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:07,362
take ten years
off your birth certificate.

258
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,325
- How are you fixed for ribbon?
- Should be some around somewhere.

259
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:12,573
- Powder, rouge, lipstick?
- I think so.

260
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,456
Nothing cheap, shoddy or obvious.

261
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:18,663
Just youth, gentility, character.

262
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:22,706
I'll go out and get the scissors.
You find the other things.

263
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,467
(Doorbells Jingling)

264
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:29,211
(Door Closing)

265
00:23:30,935 --> 00:23:33,010
(Humming)

266
00:23:35,978 --> 00:23:39,015
- Ah, here they are.
- Excuse me, young man, I...

267
00:23:41,442 --> 00:23:43,519
Oh, well.

268
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:47,852
All right, Ernest. Let's go.

269
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,005
Well, always grow back, I guess.

270
00:24:08,174 --> 00:24:10,379
(Horn Honking)

271
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,628
There's Calvin.

272
00:24:12,804 --> 00:24:17,347
- Is he alone?
- Yep. Guess he didn't sell his car.

273
00:25:14,273 --> 00:25:16,896
Hey! Would you mind
getting out of my picture?

274
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:21,914
Next thing you know, they'll be
televising the whole thing.

275
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,387
Huh.

276
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:49,857
- This your body, little man?
- Don't turn me in.

277
00:26:50,024 --> 00:26:52,596
It was an accident,
an accident, pure and simple.

278
00:26:52,775 --> 00:26:54,853
I thought he was a rabbit
or a pheasant or something.

279
00:26:55,028 --> 00:26:58,112
- It could've happened to you.
- Suppose we straighten this out?

280
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,440
I guess that's the only way out.

281
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:03,023
First thing I seen
when I rolled out this morning

282
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:05,737
was a double-breasted robin
drunk as a hoot owl,

283
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:08,119
from eating fermented chokecherries.

284
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:10,365
Right away I knew somebody
was in trouble.

285
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,496
What I didn't know
was that it was me.

286
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:17,202
The larder was empty and I got to
thinking about a toothful...

287
00:27:18,382 --> 00:27:21,500
(Sam) Stands to reason
that they can't touch you for it.

288
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:24,128
Nothing these days
stands to reason.

289
00:27:24,304 --> 00:27:27,469
It was accidental,
an act of God, perhaps.

290
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,506
In a way you should be grateful
that you were able to do your share

291
00:27:31,685 --> 00:27:34,933
in accomplishing
the destiny of a fellow being.

292
00:27:36,315 --> 00:27:38,685
Suppose, for instance,
it was written in the book of heaven,

293
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,932
that this man was to die

294
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,145
at this particular time,
at this particular place.

295
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,477
And suppose for a moment
that the actual

296
00:27:46,654 --> 00:27:50,984
accomplishing of his departure had
been bungled, something gone wrong.

297
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,197
Uh... Perhaps it was meant to be
a thunderbolt

298
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:56,576
and there was
no thunder available, say.

299
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:59,322
Well, then you come along,
and you shoot him...

300
00:27:59,502 --> 00:28:04,495
and heaven's will is done
and destiny fulfilled.

301
00:28:04,673 --> 00:28:07,624
Your conscience is quite clear.
You've got nothing to worry about.

302
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,039
Sammy, I haven't got a conscience.

303
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:12,295
And it's not heaven
that's worrying me

304
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,545
because I don't expect
I'll ever have to face it.

305
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:17,048
And it's none of those noble things
you were talking about, no.

306
00:28:17,808 --> 00:28:20,298
- Nothing like that.
- Then what is it?

307
00:28:20,476 --> 00:28:23,432
(Sighs)
It's me. It's me that's worrying me,

308
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:25,396
me and my future life.

309
00:28:25,481 --> 00:28:27,686
I know the police
and their suspicious ways.

310
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,981
You're guilty until
you're proved innocent.

311
00:28:30,152 --> 00:28:33,735
I want nothing more to do with him.
Bury him, and be done with him.

312
00:28:33,907 --> 00:28:36,147
He's no good to anyone now.

313
00:28:36,324 --> 00:28:40,452
Lay him to rest.
Put him under the sod. Forget him.

314
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,027
I never did it and you never saw him.

315
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:45,448
Yes, what about all those
other people who saw him?

316
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:49,157
How about the woman and the boy,
Miss Gravely and the tramp and...

317
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:51,413
the man who was reading the book,
Dr Greenbow?

318
00:28:51,588 --> 00:28:55,832
- How about all of them?
- Nobody was interested, I tell you.

319
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:58,381
Nobody ever cared
until you came along.

320
00:28:58,552 --> 00:29:00,509
Ah, that's what you think.

321
00:29:00,594 --> 00:29:02,921
Suppose someone starts to care
after you've buried him?

322
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:06,216
I can't wait for people to start
caring whenever they feel like it.

323
00:29:06,392 --> 00:29:08,634
I don't want a little accident
to turn into a career.

324
00:29:09,187 --> 00:29:11,427
Suppose that woman
who called him Harry...

325
00:29:11,605 --> 00:29:13,810
Suppose she decides
she loves him after all.

326
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,274
- She was hysterical with delight.
- Hm? What was she like?

327
00:29:18,443 --> 00:29:21,564
Pretty as a rainbow.
Wish I was two years younger.

328
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,857
- And with a little boy?
- Yeah, about four or five years old.

329
00:29:25,032 --> 00:29:27,868
Hmm. It's got to be Mrs Rogers
and her son.

330
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:32,664
Why don't we slip him underground
now that you've finished drawing him?

331
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,238
We could discuss
the smaller details later.

332
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:40,461
I don't like it. The authorities
like to know when people die.

333
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,083
All right, Sammy.

334
00:29:43,256 --> 00:29:46,460
Forget it. You cut off home.

335
00:29:46,635 --> 00:29:48,958
I killed him
and I'll look after his remains.

336
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:52,755
What'll you do, drag him around the
countryside the rest of the day?

337
00:29:52,932 --> 00:29:55,850
I'll do my best.
That's all a man can do.

338
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:58,770
If you're not careful, you will get
a murder charge lined up.

339
00:29:58,937 --> 00:30:01,346
Matter of fact, I'm beginning
to suspect something myself.

340
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:03,397
There you are then. See?

341
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:07,565
If you, an artist, suspect the worst,
what will they, the police, think?

342
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:10,108
What about that envelope
with his name and address on it?

343
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,653
By rights, you should
mail him back home.

344
00:30:12,826 --> 00:30:18,530
Have you forgotten who carries the
mail down to the station every night?

345
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:21,456
Calvin Wiggs, deputy sheriff.

346
00:30:21,624 --> 00:30:23,911
Oh, yes. You're right.

347
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:27,499
I'll tell you what we'll do.
I'll tell you what.

348
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,245
We'll find out how well
Mrs Rogers knows this man,

349
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:33,044
and whether she intends
to notify the police of his death.

350
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:36,883
- What good will that do?
- Why, a lot of good.

351
00:30:37,054 --> 00:30:41,761
If she's a distant friend of his and
doesn't plan to notify the police,

352
00:30:41,934 --> 00:30:44,768
then I, personally,
will help you bury Harry.

353
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:48,514
Oh, Sammy!
You've signed on for the cruise.

354
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:51,096
(Chuckles) What time is it?

355
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:55,311
- About noon.
- Good heavens.

356
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,774
I've got to go home and spruce up.
I've got a date with Miss Gravely.

357
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:02,905
Not you. You are not the one.

358
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:07,870
Oh, Sam. She could do a lot worse,
you know?

359
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:13,080
Couldn't do any better. Just think,
you'd be establishing a precedent.

360
00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:15,327
I'm not establishing nothing.

361
00:31:15,503 --> 00:31:21,042
I am going over for blueberry muffins
and coffee by her own invitation.

362
00:31:21,216 --> 00:31:24,053
And possibly some elderberry wine.

363
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,303
Do you realise that you'll be
the first man to...

364
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:29,549
cross her threshold?

365
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:35,182
Oh. Oh...
it's not too late, you know.

366
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:37,512
She's a well preserved woman.

367
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,976
- I envy you.
- Yes, very well preserved.

368
00:31:41,152 --> 00:31:46,146
And preserves
have to be opened someday. Hm?

369
00:31:46,324 --> 00:31:49,856
Yes. Now, you just trot down
and see what Mrs Rogers has to say.

370
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:53,285
- How about hiding Harry first?
- Holy smoke!

371
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:58,449
Forgetting a little detail
like that could hang a man. Yes.

372
00:32:21,937 --> 00:32:25,056
(Mumbling)

373
00:32:28,277 --> 00:32:30,351
(Groaning)

374
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:37,739
Oh. Oh, I beg your pardon.

375
00:32:37,907 --> 00:32:39,985
(Speaking Indistinctly)

376
00:32:48,626 --> 00:32:52,043
(Captain) I hope I never have to be
operated on by Dr Greenbow.

377
00:32:52,213 --> 00:32:54,288
- Come on. Let's get going.
- Yeah.

378
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,177
(Mrs Rogers) Good afternoon.

379
00:33:58,145 --> 00:34:00,435
You're beautiful, wonderful.

380
00:34:00,607 --> 00:34:03,061
You're the most wonderful,
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

381
00:34:03,232 --> 00:34:05,307
I'd like to paint you.

382
00:34:05,483 --> 00:34:09,778
Was there something else
you wanted, Mr... Marlowe, isn't it?

383
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:14,898
You certainly are a lovely woman.
I'd like to paint you nude.

384
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:18,992
Some other time, Mr Marlowe. I was
about to make Arnie some lemonade.

385
00:34:19,164 --> 00:34:22,661
Oh, yes, of course. Perhaps I've come
at an awkward moment.

386
00:34:22,832 --> 00:34:25,289
If you want to undress me, you have.

387
00:34:25,461 --> 00:34:27,535
Well, it wasn't exactly that.

388
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,121
I came here to talk to you about
something, but after I saw you it...

389
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:32,172
slipped my mind.

390
00:34:32,341 --> 00:34:35,794
- It couldn't have been important.
- I guess you're right.

391
00:34:35,971 --> 00:34:40,180
Sit on the porch. I'll get you a
lemonade. Maybe you'll think of it.

392
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:42,886
You're not only beautiful,
you're considerate too.

393
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,018
- Arnie!
- Hello, Mr Marlowe!

394
00:34:47,189 --> 00:34:49,263
Hi. What do you got, a rabbit?

395
00:34:50,274 --> 00:34:52,229
Dead. What have you got?

396
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,935
Oh, I got me a little frog.

397
00:34:56,112 --> 00:34:57,770
Whoop!

398
00:34:58,407 --> 00:35:00,896
- (Sam) There he is.
- (Mrs Rogers) It's hungry.

399
00:35:01,075 --> 00:35:03,149
Whoop!

400
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:06,278
(Laughing)

401
00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:10,911
- I'll trade ya.
- Your mother for mine?

402
00:35:11,084 --> 00:35:15,080
- The rabbit for the frog.
- It's yours, Arnie.

403
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:20,208
I think you got the best deal.
Dead rabbits don't eat.

404
00:35:20,383 --> 00:35:24,546
I'll just take it in the kitchen
and give him some lemonade.

405
00:35:31,351 --> 00:35:35,183
Four rabbit's feet,
and he got killed.

406
00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:39,898
- Should've had a four-leaf clover.
- And a horseshoe.

407
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:42,474
Say, how do rabbits get to be born?

408
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:46,234
- Same way elephants do.
- Oh, sure.

409
00:35:46,407 --> 00:35:48,979
How come you never came over
to visit me before?

410
00:35:49,157 --> 00:35:51,235
Didn't know you had such
a pretty mother, Arnie.

411
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:55,323
If you think she's pretty,
you should see my slingshot.

412
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,492
- Perhaps I'll come back tomorrow.
- When's that?

413
00:35:59,668 --> 00:36:03,333
- The day after today.
- That's yesterday. Today's tomorrow.

414
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,080
- It was.
- When was tomorrow yesterday?

415
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:12,004
- Today.
- Oh, sure, yesterday.

416
00:36:12,178 --> 00:36:15,345
(Mrs Rogers) You'll never make sense
out of Arnie. He has his own timing.

417
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,683
Thank you.

418
00:36:22,854 --> 00:36:25,605
- Lemonade, Arnie?
- I already swiped two glasses.

419
00:36:25,775 --> 00:36:29,817
- I would've given you two glasses.
- It's more fun to swipe.

420
00:36:29,984 --> 00:36:32,062
Can I borrow your rabbit, Mr Marlowe?

421
00:36:32,238 --> 00:36:34,313
Sure, Arnie.
What are you gonna do with it?

422
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:38,487
You never know when a dead rabbit
might come in handy.

423
00:36:39,494 --> 00:36:41,568
It already got me one frog.

424
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,289
(Mrs Rogers)
Arnie! Where are you going now?

425
00:36:49,462 --> 00:36:51,749
To make some more trades.

426
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:55,291
- Come home in time for supper.
- (Arnie) OK.

427
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:58,834
What's your given name? If you don't
want to tell me, just make one up.

428
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,179
Jennifer. Jennifer Rogers.

429
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:05,588
Nice.

430
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:09,052
Um, who's the man up on the path?

431
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:12,432
- What man?
- You know, Harry, the dead man.

432
00:37:13,191 --> 00:37:15,265
Oh, him.

433
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,517
That's my husband.

434
00:37:17,692 --> 00:37:20,185
Your husband's dead, then?

435
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,358
Is your lemonade sweet enough?

436
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,655
- It seems to be.
- I like it tart.

437
00:37:27,743 --> 00:37:30,449
Harry is Arnie's father, then?

438
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,326
- No, Arnie's father's dead.
- So is Harry.

439
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:37,997
Thank goodness.
He was too good to live.

440
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,038
From his looks, he didn't appear to
me to be the kind who was too good.

441
00:37:41,213 --> 00:37:43,621
Well, he was. Horribly good.

442
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,213
I like your mouth too,
especially when you say, "Good."

443
00:37:51,555 --> 00:37:55,008
- Will you have some more lemonade?
- Well, maybe later. Thanks.

444
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:57,591
Where'd Arnie get the rabbit?

445
00:37:58,603 --> 00:38:00,977
He found it.
Maybe the Captain shot it.

446
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:06,058
I'd like to hear more
of your life story.

447
00:38:06,237 --> 00:38:08,311
You see, we don't know
quite what to do with Harry.

448
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:12,984
- Thought you might have suggestions.
- You can stuff him for all I care.

449
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:15,941
Stuff him
and put him in a glass case.

450
00:38:16,118 --> 00:38:19,037
Only I'd suggest frosted glass.

451
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:23,619
What did he do to you,
besides marry you?

452
00:38:26,002 --> 00:38:30,214
Look, I've wanted to explain
about Harry a lot of times...

453
00:38:30,382 --> 00:38:33,714
(Church Bells Ringing)
But nobody would understand,

454
00:38:33,884 --> 00:38:36,506
least of all, Harry.

455
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,753
But you...

456
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:42,050
You've got an artistic mind.
You can see the finer things.

457
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:45,094
When I'm lucky.
Go on, tell me everything.

458
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:47,559
Let it all out.

459
00:38:48,981 --> 00:38:54,057
It was a long time ago and I was
in love. I was too much in love.

460
00:38:54,236 --> 00:38:56,939
- What was his name?
- Robert.

461
00:38:57,112 --> 00:39:00,149
We'd agreed to overlook each other's
families and get married.

462
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:03,445
- Did you?
- Oh, yes.

463
00:39:04,621 --> 00:39:07,454
- And then Robert got killed.
- Oh?

464
00:39:08,455 --> 00:39:12,240
I was heartbroken for six weeks.

465
00:39:12,418 --> 00:39:15,373
Then I discovered little Arnie
was on the way.

466
00:39:15,547 --> 00:39:19,079
- Must have been a shock.
- Well, that's where Harry came in.

467
00:39:19,548 --> 00:39:23,499
Harry the handsome hero.
Harry the saint.

468
00:39:23,678 --> 00:39:26,596
- Harry the good.
- I didn't catch his last name.

469
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:29,385
Harry Worp, Robert's brother,
his older brother.

470
00:39:29,557 --> 00:39:31,597
And he fell in love with you?

471
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:34,887
If he'd have fallen in love with me,
I wouldn't have minded.

472
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:38,267
He wanted to marry me because he was
Robert's brother and felt noble.

473
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,766
But you thought he was
in love with you?

474
00:39:41,068 --> 00:39:44,900
And I decided to let him
love me because of Arnie.

475
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:47,692
It was on my second wedding night
that I learned the truth.

476
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:52,362
You didn't learn on your first?

477
00:39:53,787 --> 00:39:57,654
(Dog Barking)
This was a terrible truth...

478
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:59,990
The truth about Harry.

479
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:04,497
- Just what happened?
- How old are you, Mr Marlowe?

480
00:40:04,964 --> 00:40:06,540
About 30.

481
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,084
This is what happened.

482
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:18,715
I was in the hotel room alone.
I put on my best nightie.

483
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:20,968
- You understand?
- Perfectly.

484
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:25,061
Although I had no true feeling
for Harry,

485
00:40:25,232 --> 00:40:29,394
I worked myself into an enthusiasm
because I thought he loved me.

486
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:31,645
Must have been hard work.

487
00:40:32,447 --> 00:40:34,936
There was a full moon,
and I sat by the window

488
00:40:35,114 --> 00:40:38,401
because I thought it would show off
my new nightie to advantage.

489
00:40:38,577 --> 00:40:40,236
Naturally.

490
00:40:42,037 --> 00:40:44,244
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

491
00:40:44,415 --> 00:40:47,829
You, a perfect stranger too.
I'm not boring you, am I?

492
00:40:48,002 --> 00:40:49,994
No. Not at all.

493
00:40:51,337 --> 00:40:55,122
- How about some more lemonade?
- Soon, soon.

494
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,624
Oh, where was I?

495
00:40:57,801 --> 00:41:00,507
You were sitting by the window
because it was a full moon

496
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:03,347
and you'd worked yourself up
to a certain enthusiasm.

497
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:06,514
I said all that?

498
00:41:06,685 --> 00:41:08,925
Uh, when does Harry come in?

499
00:41:09,936 --> 00:41:12,607
He doesn't. He never came in.

500
00:41:12,774 --> 00:41:16,983
- He called the following morning.
- The following morning?

501
00:41:17,153 --> 00:41:19,938
In the hotel lobby the night before,
he bought a magazine.

502
00:41:20,113 --> 00:41:22,436
- His horoscope was in it.
- Bad?

503
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:25,483
It said... He was a Taurus.

504
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:28,658
It said, 'Don't start
any new project that day.

505
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:32,363
- It could never be finished.'
- And what did you do?

506
00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:36,668
I left him on the spot,
and went home to mother's. The end.

507
00:41:37,586 --> 00:41:39,661
What a poignant story.

508
00:41:39,837 --> 00:41:41,915
I knew you'd understand.

509
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,295
- Nobody else does.
- Not even mother?

510
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:47,338
She thought I should live with him,
but I wouldn't.

511
00:41:47,512 --> 00:41:50,962
He pestered me to go back,
but I always refused.

512
00:41:51,138 --> 00:41:54,508
Well, suppose some night
I wanted him to do something...

513
00:41:54,685 --> 00:41:57,055
like the dishes, for example.

514
00:41:57,227 --> 00:42:00,762
- His horoscope wouldn't let him.
- You're absolutely right.

515
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,226
There are some things
I just don't like to do by myself.

516
00:42:04,402 --> 00:42:08,693
And no one with any true
understanding would blame you for it.

517
00:42:09,782 --> 00:42:13,991
When Arnie was born, I moved to where
I thought Harry could never find me.

518
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:16,698
I changed my name and...

519
00:42:16,871 --> 00:42:19,360
But he was persistent?

520
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:21,828
This morning there was a knock
on the door.

521
00:42:22,001 --> 00:42:25,035
Before I opened it, I knew he was
standing on the other side.

522
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,418
- What did he want?
- Me!

523
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:30,256
He wanted me because I was his wife.

524
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:34,422
He wanted me because, as he put it,
he suddenly felt some basic urge...

525
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,669
- Loneliness.
- What'd you feel?

526
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:40,673
I felt sick. Did you see
his moustache and his wavy hair?

527
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,925
Yeah, but when I saw him,
he was dead.

528
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,683
Yeah, he looked exactly the same when
he was alive, except he was vertical.

529
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,226
So he entered. What'd you say?

530
00:42:49,397 --> 00:42:52,435
Nothing. I hit him over the head with
a milk bottle and knocked him silly.

531
00:42:52,902 --> 00:42:54,311
Silly?

532
00:42:55,069 --> 00:42:57,147
Bats. Tappy.

533
00:42:57,322 --> 00:43:00,108
He staggered up towards the woods
saying he was gonna find his wife

534
00:43:00,282 --> 00:43:02,360
and drag her home if it killed him.

535
00:43:02,536 --> 00:43:04,575
Apparently it did.

536
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:07,360
(Giggling)

537
00:43:07,538 --> 00:43:10,658
(Horn Honking)
Have some more lemonade.

538
00:43:52,578 --> 00:43:55,366
Why, Captain Wiles, what a surprise.

539
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:59,701
But you invited me, Miss Gravely.
At least that's how I remember it.

540
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:03,411
Of course I did, Captain,
but somehow, it's still a surprise.

541
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:07,669
Oh, yes. You certainly know
how to make a man feel wanted.

542
00:44:07,842 --> 00:44:10,332
Won't you come in, Captain?

543
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:14,093
Thank you.
I... I've looked forward to it.

544
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:32,814
(Chuckling) Takes a real cook to
make a good blueberry muffin,

545
00:44:32,988 --> 00:44:35,229
to keep the blueberries
from sitting on the bottom.

546
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:38,735
High-bush blueberries,
that's the secret.

547
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:44,117
I picked 'em up near where you shot
that unfortunate man.

548
00:44:49,003 --> 00:44:51,671
A real handsome man's cup.

549
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:55,329
It's been in the family for years.

550
00:44:55,508 --> 00:44:58,211
My father always used it
up until he died.

551
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:05,181
I trust he died peacefully,
slipped away in the night.

552
00:45:05,642 --> 00:45:08,132
He was caught in a threshing machine.

553
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:12,725
I hope I haven't distressed you,
Captain.

554
00:45:12,898 --> 00:45:14,973
Not at all. Not at all.

555
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:18,234
I'm used to looking on the rough side
of things.

556
00:45:18,403 --> 00:45:20,810
I am man who's faced death
many times.

557
00:45:21,445 --> 00:45:23,523
Rather recently too.

558
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,573
Yeah.

559
00:45:29,705 --> 00:45:31,780
Arnie. What are you carrying there?

560
00:45:32,622 --> 00:45:35,411
- A rabbit.
- (Captain) A rabbit?

561
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:41,172
- What do you call it?
- Dead. It ain't mine.

562
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:45,003
- Well, whose is it?
- Yours. You shot it with your gun.

563
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:48,130
You must've killed it today.
It should make a nice stew for ya.

564
00:45:48,304 --> 00:45:50,710
A rabbit! I finally killed a rabbit!

565
00:45:50,888 --> 00:45:54,257
- (Captain Wiles) Where'd you get it?
- In the blueberry muffins.

566
00:45:55,101 --> 00:45:57,510
- What?
- Out in the woods.

567
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:01,304
Oh, here you are. One muffin
for one rabbit. Fair enough?

568
00:46:01,481 --> 00:46:03,559
That was a two-muffin rabbit.

569
00:46:03,735 --> 00:46:05,691
(Chuckles)

570
00:46:05,861 --> 00:46:07,936
- I gotta go now.
- Oh.

571
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,321
(Sighs) Hm.

572
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:24,993
It's, uh, certainly a nice afternoon,
Miss Gravely.

573
00:46:25,168 --> 00:46:27,246
- Isn't it?
- Mm.

574
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:32,165
Yes, and you're, you're a nice woman.

575
00:46:32,344 --> 00:46:35,544
And I think you're awfully nice,
Captain Wiles.

576
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:39,931
Um, um.
Let's get back to our little problem.

577
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:42,304
Harry. What's going to become of him?

578
00:46:42,474 --> 00:46:44,552
Oh, now, now.
Don't you worry about Harry.

579
00:46:44,729 --> 00:46:47,016
He'll be comfortably
underground before nightfall.

580
00:46:47,188 --> 00:46:51,649
All that digging and work.
Couldn't you just...

581
00:46:51,818 --> 00:46:56,479
let him slide off the end
of your boat pier into the pond?

582
00:46:56,656 --> 00:46:59,524
And have him pop up like a cork?
No, sir.

583
00:46:59,698 --> 00:47:02,570
Nobody ever popped up
from under four feet of ground.

584
00:47:02,744 --> 00:47:06,324
No. Besides, they'll be
cutting ice there this winter.

585
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,332
Now wouldn't it be a nice thing
if they were cutting blocks of ice -

586
00:47:09,499 --> 00:47:12,618
Never mind, Captain. You're right.

587
00:47:13,837 --> 00:47:16,540
Yes. Underground is the best place
for Harry.

588
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:46,277
He seems comfortable, Sam,
very comfortable and snug.

589
00:47:46,448 --> 00:47:49,118
We better find a place and get it dug
and the sooner the better.

590
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:53,410
If what you say about Mrs Rogers
and her husband is true, I agree.

591
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:56,152
Well, let's find a place.

592
00:47:56,457 --> 00:48:00,158
No use making hard work out of it. We
need a place where the earth is soft.

593
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:03,869
And a place where the whole town
won't stumble over us as we work.

594
00:48:04,045 --> 00:48:07,878
Mm. A place with a certain
character and attractiveness.

595
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:11,385
Facing west so that Harry
can watch the setting sun.

596
00:48:11,554 --> 00:48:14,921
- Where it'll be cosy in winter.
- And cool in the summer.

597
00:48:15,098 --> 00:48:18,302
You know, I'm half envying Harry.

598
00:48:18,476 --> 00:48:21,345
It wouldn't take much longer
to dig it twice as wide.

599
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:25,185
Well, thanks for your kindness,
but some other time.

600
00:48:29,778 --> 00:48:32,777
- Here. This looks like a good place.
- Ahh!

601
00:48:32,946 --> 00:48:35,817
You're a lucky fellow, Harry Worp.

602
00:48:40,955 --> 00:48:43,278
- Come on, off with your coat.
- Who, me?

603
00:48:43,456 --> 00:48:45,530
Certainly you.
It's your body, isn't it?

604
00:48:45,707 --> 00:48:47,784
I'm not much of a hand
at grave digging.

605
00:48:47,961 --> 00:48:50,995
You should've thought of that
before you went hunting this morning.

606
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,248
(Car Engine Revving)

607
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:57,251
Calvin Wiggs. What'll we do now?

608
00:48:57,425 --> 00:49:00,759
Think up the best story
he's ever heard.

609
00:49:02,055 --> 00:49:04,132
(Car Engine Recedes)

610
00:49:24,616 --> 00:49:26,693
Lay down your shovel, Sam.

611
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:29,704
- What's the trouble?
- I'm dead beat.

612
00:49:29,871 --> 00:49:33,157
Good.
I was dead beat ten minutes ago.

613
00:49:33,334 --> 00:49:36,617
I wanted to keep digging
until you gave up.

614
00:49:42,298 --> 00:49:45,419
- Brrrr! Gives me the creeps.
- Yeah?

615
00:49:45,594 --> 00:49:48,593
Come on.
Let's get Harry and pop him in.

616
00:49:54,975 --> 00:49:57,053
With hasty reverence.

617
00:50:03,526 --> 00:50:07,391
There. Would you like to say
a few words, Captain?

618
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:11,816
Yes, I would. Harry Worp, don't ever
show your face around here again.

619
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:14,068
(Car Approaching)

620
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,494
Let's finish this job
and get out of here.

621
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:23,079
Captain, I think Calvin Wiggs
is looking for something.

622
00:50:23,251 --> 00:50:25,577
Think he knows Harry Worp came here?

623
00:50:25,754 --> 00:50:28,872
Sammy, that's as horrible
a thought as you've ever had.

624
00:50:29,047 --> 00:50:31,172
And that he wonders what happened
to Harry and where he is?

625
00:50:31,342 --> 00:50:35,088
My only answer is to keep
on scraping, and fast.

626
00:50:36,303 --> 00:50:40,052
If you must kill things from now on,
I wish you'd stick to rabbits.

627
00:50:40,224 --> 00:50:43,012
- The body's smaller.
- Rabbits! I didn't tell you, did I?

628
00:50:43,186 --> 00:50:47,513
- I shot a rabbit today!
- Don't shout. I know you did.

629
00:50:47,688 --> 00:50:50,559
I was up at Jennifer Rogers'
when Arnie showed me the rabbit.

630
00:50:50,734 --> 00:50:54,150
Jennifer, eh?
Didn't waste much time, did you?

631
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:56,396
Well, I don't blame you, Sammy.

632
00:50:56,572 --> 00:50:58,942
A very nice widow she'll make.
Very nice.

633
00:50:59,114 --> 00:51:01,239
Let's discuss her
when we've finished with Harry.

634
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:04,243
No need to get huffy. I don't want
to talk about your affairs.

635
00:51:04,411 --> 00:51:06,571
I've got affairs of my own.

636
00:51:06,748 --> 00:51:09,783
- You mean my protégée?
- Come again?

637
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:14,170
Miss Gravely. The lady I renovated
at Mrs Wiggs' this afternoon.

638
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:17,206
A most remarkable
reversion to femininity.

639
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,670
I don't quite get you, Sammy boy.

640
00:51:19,842 --> 00:51:22,296
She came into the Emporium
in rather high excitement.

641
00:51:22,468 --> 00:51:25,470
Wanted a new cup and saucer,
lots of other things.

642
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:28,887
I gave her a new makeup
and hairdo.

643
00:51:29,057 --> 00:51:31,264
Don't tell me you didn't notice.

644
00:51:31,435 --> 00:51:33,143
She's a nice lady.

645
00:51:33,312 --> 00:51:36,017
- Very nice.
- We're all nice.

646
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,597
I don't see how anyone
could help but like guys like us.

647
00:51:38,774 --> 00:51:42,725
I agree. I don't know whether
I've grown rose-colored glasses or -

648
00:51:42,903 --> 00:51:44,860
Or if you're in love?

649
00:51:45,029 --> 00:51:46,905
Aha! (Chuckling)

650
00:51:47,076 --> 00:51:50,240
There's nothing like finding yourself
in love.

651
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:52,819
No, it adds zest to your work.

652
00:51:52,996 --> 00:51:55,284
Zest! Zest!

653
00:51:56,289 --> 00:51:58,996
I think I've had enough zest
for a while.

654
00:51:59,169 --> 00:52:03,744
- Let's sit down and rest, huh?
- Oh, why not. We've earned it.

655
00:52:06,633 --> 00:52:10,168
Tell me, Sam, What did Jennifer think
of my shooting?

656
00:52:10,346 --> 00:52:12,420
You mean Mrs Rogers?

657
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:15,086
Oh, I think by now I'm entitled to be
on a first-name basis with her.

658
00:52:15,263 --> 00:52:18,016
After all, I brought her a happy
release with one bullet.

659
00:52:18,185 --> 00:52:20,970
One bullet? How 'bout that
"No Shooting" sign that I found?

660
00:52:21,143 --> 00:52:24,063
Well, that. One bullet
for the "No Shooting" sign,

661
00:52:24,231 --> 00:52:26,981
one for the beer can
and one for Harry.

662
00:52:27,149 --> 00:52:30,436
- How about the rabbit?
- And one for the ra...

663
00:52:34,533 --> 00:52:36,607
What's the matter?

664
00:52:36,784 --> 00:52:40,283
- What's wrong? What's bitten you?
- I only fired three bullets.

665
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:44,070
Three! One for the shooting sign,
one for the beer can -

666
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,372
And one for the little man
who's lying in the grave.

667
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:49,114
No, Sammy, no. That's just it.
One for the rabbit.

668
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:51,537
If I shot the rabbit,
I didn't shoot Harry.

669
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:54,334
Oh, Sammy boy, what have you
tried to make me do?

670
00:52:54,507 --> 00:52:56,584
Tried to make a murderer out of me.

671
00:52:58,845 --> 00:53:02,925
Well, don't sit there. Help me!
You helped bury him.

672
00:53:03,808 --> 00:53:07,506
Even if you didn't kill him, why dig
him up now that he's nicely planted?

673
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,844
I promised Jennifer
that we'd bury him.

674
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:12,096
Keep my word, he should stay buried.

675
00:53:13,147 --> 00:53:16,149
Besides whether you killed him
or not, you've incriminated yourself.

676
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:20,565
You'll have more of a job explaining
a body that you didn't kill and bury,

677
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:24,569
than a body that you accidentally
killed and buried, right, Captain?

678
00:53:29,412 --> 00:53:31,905
You're not supposed to bury bodies
whenever you find them.

679
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,240
It makes people suspicious.

680
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:37,167
Supposed to tell the police
or advertise or something.

681
00:53:37,546 --> 00:53:41,292
Oh, Sammy, you don't understand.
You don't comprehend one bit.

682
00:53:41,465 --> 00:53:44,716
You wouldn't like me to go through
life not knowing if I've killed him?

683
00:53:48,053 --> 00:53:51,505
Very inconsistent. First, you tell me
you've got no conscience.

684
00:53:51,682 --> 00:53:54,301
Now you talk about something that
sounds remarkably like a conscience.

685
00:53:54,475 --> 00:53:56,552
Oh, Sammy, come on. Help me.

686
00:53:56,729 --> 00:53:59,846
I don't care if I killed him or not,
for all that matters.

687
00:54:00,022 --> 00:54:04,600
But I'll get the shakes
whenever I see a policeman.

688
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:06,819
All right.

689
00:54:06,988 --> 00:54:10,271
If I had my choice, I'd rather be
thought a murderer than proved one.

690
00:54:10,448 --> 00:54:15,524
Thank you. With two of us digging,
we'll have Harry out in nothing flat.

691
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:26,664
Can't see much from here. I'd better
get in down there and look at him.

692
00:54:26,838 --> 00:54:31,001
- Let me do the honours.
- OK, Sammy. You've got good eyes.

693
00:54:32,425 --> 00:54:35,509
Hey, that isn't a bullet wound.

694
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,461
Isn't a bullet wound?
Well, what d'ya know.

695
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,558
That's what they call a blow
with a blunt instrument.

696
00:54:42,727 --> 00:54:45,263
Huh? What are you thinking, Sammy?

697
00:54:47,104 --> 00:54:51,102
I think, Captain Wiles,
we're tangled up in a murder.

698
00:54:51,775 --> 00:54:55,062
Murder? If it's murder, who done it?

699
00:54:55,571 --> 00:54:58,736
- Who did it?
- That's what I say, who done it?

700
00:54:58,908 --> 00:55:02,441
Apart from Jennifer Rogers,
who else'd want to kill him?

701
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:05,988
Apart from Jennifer?

702
00:55:06,164 --> 00:55:09,531
- Yeah. Do you think that she would -
- Oh, it's ridiculous.

703
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:12,579
You said she was surprised to see
the body when she came up here.

704
00:55:12,752 --> 00:55:15,040
You said she hit him on the head.

705
00:55:15,212 --> 00:55:17,502
Coming home from Madagascar once,
we had a fireman on board

706
00:55:17,674 --> 00:55:20,424
who hit his head on a brick wall
and died two days later.

707
00:55:20,592 --> 00:55:22,919
Where could he find a brick wall
on board a ship?

708
00:55:23,096 --> 00:55:26,011
Hmmm, that's what we always wondered.

709
00:55:28,393 --> 00:55:30,846
Couldn't have been Jennifer. No.

710
00:55:31,018 --> 00:55:33,508
Besides, what's it matter who did it?

711
00:55:33,686 --> 00:55:36,604
It'll be better for all of us
if he's buried and out of the way.

712
00:55:36,773 --> 00:55:39,978
Nothing doing. I'm not burying
someone else's bad habits.

713
00:55:40,153 --> 00:55:42,439
Hmm? Suppose it was Miss Gravely?

714
00:55:42,612 --> 00:55:46,147
What? (Laughing)

715
00:55:46,324 --> 00:55:48,612
No, it's not as funny as all that.

716
00:55:48,783 --> 00:55:50,858
You said yourself she wasn't
particularly startled

717
00:55:51,034 --> 00:55:53,112
to see you dragging Harry
up the path.

718
00:55:53,288 --> 00:55:55,991
You artists have got no idea
of etiquette.

719
00:55:56,164 --> 00:56:00,375
She is a lady of gentle habits and
upbringing who hides her feelings.

720
00:56:00,544 --> 00:56:03,830
If I wasn't holding Harry's ankles,
she'd have never mentioned him.

721
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:05,085
Really?

722
00:56:05,256 --> 00:56:07,213
When she said...

723
00:56:07,382 --> 00:56:09,840
'What seems to be the trouble,
Captain? ',

724
00:56:10,011 --> 00:56:12,252
it was nothing more
than a pleasantry, so to speak.

725
00:56:12,429 --> 00:56:18,301
Like, 'Nice day, isn't it? ' 'I'm
sure, yes.' Or something like that.

726
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:21,098
Going to help me bury him again?

727
00:56:21,271 --> 00:56:24,603
Um... I don't know.

728
00:56:24,772 --> 00:56:28,439
'Course, it might have been
Dr Greenbow or the tramp.

729
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:32,229
- Or Jennifer?
- I told you it couldn't...

730
00:56:32,406 --> 00:56:36,698
Well, no point in arguing about it.
Let's get rid of him.

731
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:42,861
OK. You helped me in my hour of need.
I guess it's up to me to help you.

732
00:56:43,038 --> 00:56:45,744
We'll file Harry away
once and for all.

733
00:56:45,918 --> 00:56:48,157
No more nonsense about it.

734
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:16,227
Come aboard, Miss Gravely,
come aboard.

735
00:57:16,401 --> 00:57:19,072
It's just an old salt's
snug anchorage.

736
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:22,855
Small, not palatial like yours,
But homely, very...

737
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,829
Won't you sit down, Miss Gravely?

738
00:57:41,464 --> 00:57:43,542
Thank you.

739
00:57:45,635 --> 00:57:49,799
It's funny. Funny how we got to be
so friendly in one afternoon.

740
00:57:49,973 --> 00:57:53,923
I knew you weren't as prim
and starchy as they made out. No.

741
00:57:54,102 --> 00:57:56,177
(Chuckling) Not by a long shot.

742
00:57:56,354 --> 00:57:58,309
- Really?
- No.

743
00:57:58,479 --> 00:58:01,848
I'm a man who can recognise
the human qualities in a woman.

744
00:58:02,025 --> 00:58:04,099
When I first saw you
down where Harry was -

745
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:06,354
- Captain Wiles.
- Yes, ma'am?

746
00:58:06,529 --> 00:58:09,102
Before you make your kind thoughts
known to me,

747
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,231
I should like to offer you some
explanation of my sudden invitation

748
00:58:13,409 --> 00:58:16,159
to coffee and blueberry muffins
this afternoon

749
00:58:16,328 --> 00:58:19,365
and my...
and my sitting with you here now.

750
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,697
No, ma'am,
you don't have to explain anything.

751
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:25,824
You came to my aid at a moment of
crisis, for which I'm truly grateful.

752
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:30,213
Thank you, but it's just that
I owe you some reason.

753
00:58:30,383 --> 00:58:32,670
No, no, no.
I won't hear a word of it.

754
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:35,299
You saw the predicament I was in
with that body on my hands

755
00:58:35,472 --> 00:58:39,846
and you shut your eyes to it in a
most sporting fashion, if I say so.

756
00:58:40,014 --> 00:58:42,222
- Captain Wiles.
- Yes, ma'am?

757
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:46,140
I'm trying to tell you the reason
I asked you to coffee and muffins.

758
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,851
It was because... I felt -

759
00:58:49,024 --> 00:58:51,098
- Sympathy.
- Gratitude.

760
00:58:51,275 --> 00:58:54,111
Gra...? But I'm the one
who should be grateful.

761
00:58:54,278 --> 00:58:59,154
No, I was grateful.
I... I am grateful.

762
00:58:59,325 --> 00:59:03,320
I'm grateful to you
for burying my body.

763
00:59:08,665 --> 00:59:10,541
Your body?

764
00:59:11,002 --> 00:59:13,289
The man you thought you killed...

765
00:59:13,461 --> 00:59:17,673
was the man I hit over the head with
the leather heel of my hiking shoe.

766
00:59:17,841 --> 00:59:19,003
You?

767
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,960
And with a metal cleat
on the end of it.

768
00:59:22,137 --> 00:59:23,299
But why?

769
00:59:25,054 --> 00:59:27,132
He annoyed me.

770
00:59:27,308 --> 00:59:29,844
I was walking towards home when he

771
00:59:30,018 --> 00:59:32,423
suddenly came at me
with a wild look in his eye

772
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:34,477
and insisted...

773
00:59:34,647 --> 00:59:38,014
- we were married.
- Oh, you knew each other before.

774
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:42,354
Believe it or not, I had never
seen him before in my life and...

775
00:59:42,528 --> 00:59:45,150
if I ever had,
I never would have married him.

776
00:59:45,324 --> 00:59:47,729
He must have mistaken you
for someone else.

777
00:59:47,908 --> 00:59:51,776
Oh, no, he very definitely
pulled me into the bushes.

778
00:59:52,537 --> 00:59:55,620
- Yes?
- I came out again.

779
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:58,206
Go on.

780
00:59:58,376 --> 01:00:00,450
He pulled me back.

781
01:00:01,419 --> 01:00:02,880
Twice.

782
01:00:03,714 --> 01:00:07,842
He swore at me,
horrible, masculine sounds.

783
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:11,211
- I didn't understand it, of course.
- Of course you didn't.

784
01:00:12,637 --> 01:00:15,130
- We fought.
- Then what?

785
01:00:16,558 --> 01:00:21,184
I won. My shoe had come off
in the struggle, and I hit him.

786
01:00:21,354 --> 01:00:25,136
I hit him as hard as ever I could.

787
01:00:28,151 --> 01:00:30,226
You killed him.

788
01:00:31,781 --> 01:00:35,859
I must have done it.
I was annoyed, Captain.

789
01:00:37,077 --> 01:00:39,199
- Very annoyed.
- Naturally.

790
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:42,487
I don't think
I've ever been so annoyed.

791
01:00:42,663 --> 01:00:47,491
Consequently, I... I didn't
realise my own capabilities.

792
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:50,705
Whew! Seems to me...

793
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,997
Mrs Rogers knocked him silly,
and you finished him off.

794
01:00:54,843 --> 01:00:57,129
Why should Mrs Rogers
knock him silly?

795
01:00:57,302 --> 01:00:59,376
She was really his wife.

796
01:00:59,553 --> 01:01:02,804
Poor woman.
I thought she had better taste.

797
01:01:05,724 --> 01:01:07,802
You know, Captain,

798
01:01:07,978 --> 01:01:11,808
when I ran away I decided I would
never tell a soul what had happened.

799
01:01:11,982 --> 01:01:14,519
Then I met you, and I thought...

800
01:01:15,026 --> 01:01:19,901
how convenient it was that you
should think that you had shot him.

801
01:01:20,072 --> 01:01:23,355
- Forgive me for thinking that.
- Only natural.

802
01:01:23,532 --> 01:01:28,324
That's why I felt... I still feel
under an obligation to you.

803
01:01:28,494 --> 01:01:30,785
Oh, not at all. Let's forget it.

804
01:01:30,957 --> 01:01:33,956
Oh, no, we mustn't do that.
It would hardly be fair to you.

805
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:40,033
For you to go through life knowing
you had buried a man you didn't kill.

806
01:01:40,213 --> 01:01:42,587
You would have my crime
on your conscience.

807
01:01:42,758 --> 01:01:45,592
It's a pleasure, (Hiccups)
I'm sure.

808
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,885
But no.

809
01:01:48,055 --> 01:01:51,303
Now I realise that Harry man
was out of his mind,

810
01:01:51,473 --> 01:01:53,551
and my action was justifiable,

811
01:01:53,727 --> 01:01:57,591
there's no reason we shouldn't let
the authorities know about it.

812
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:01,270
- The authorities?
- Everything will be cleared up.

813
01:02:01,441 --> 01:02:04,226
I'm sure Calvin Wiggs and the police

814
01:02:04,403 --> 01:02:06,727
won't make a fuss about it
when we explain.

815
01:02:06,904 --> 01:02:09,191
Perhaps it needn't get
into the papers at all.

816
01:02:09,363 --> 01:02:12,614
Don't you believe it. They love it,
the papers, this kind of thing.

817
01:02:12,785 --> 01:02:15,108
Murder and passion.

818
01:02:15,285 --> 01:02:17,956
You let Harry be.
Just forget it ever happened.

819
01:02:18,123 --> 01:02:21,703
The same as Sammy and me
and Jennifer Rogers are going to do.

820
01:02:21,876 --> 01:02:26,452
Oh, but... but it isn't your body.

821
01:02:26,629 --> 01:02:31,089
After all, I killed him, so it's only
fair that I should have the say so -

822
01:02:31,258 --> 01:02:32,917
- Yes, but -
- Don't you agree?

823
01:02:33,092 --> 01:02:34,837
- Well, in a way -
- I thought you would.

824
01:02:35,013 --> 01:02:36,885
I tell you what, Captain.

825
01:02:40,142 --> 01:02:42,678
- We'll go and get a spade now.
- But ma'am -

826
01:02:42,852 --> 01:02:45,474
And after we've dug him up,
we'll go back to my place

827
01:02:45,648 --> 01:02:48,765
and I'll make you
some hot chocolate.

828
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:31,723
Arnie's so tired he'll sleep all day
and half the night.

829
01:03:31,896 --> 01:03:34,681
I think you've got a pretty house,
Jennifer.

830
01:03:34,772 --> 01:03:38,023
It's the best I could do
on Robert's insurance.

831
01:03:38,234 --> 01:03:40,724
- Sugar?
- No, black, thanks.

832
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:52,826
It's funny, but...

833
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:56,364
I feel awful comfortable with you,
Sam.

834
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,082
You know, I feel the same way too.

835
01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:03,329
It's a good feeling,

836
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:07,882
feeling comfortable with someone
who feels that way too.

837
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:13,181
There is one thing
I feel uncomfortable about.

838
01:04:13,348 --> 01:04:16,466
Just tell me what it is,
and I'll take care of it for you.

839
01:04:16,641 --> 01:04:21,433
- It's Harry. What about Harry?
- Harry? Don't you think about Harry.

840
01:04:21,605 --> 01:04:24,890
Harry's part of the earth.
He's with eternity, the ages.

841
01:04:25,067 --> 01:04:27,638
Take my word for it,
Harry's ancient history.

842
01:04:27,818 --> 01:04:30,107
(Knocking At Door)

843
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,354
Come in, whoever it is.

844
01:04:34,448 --> 01:04:36,525
What happened?

845
01:04:36,702 --> 01:04:39,321
Sam, I've got something to tell you.

846
01:04:39,495 --> 01:04:42,946
No, Captain,
I have something to tell him.

847
01:04:43,124 --> 01:04:45,874
Now who's going to tell what?

848
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:49,458
(Sighs) I killed Harry
with the heel of my shoe.

849
01:04:53,842 --> 01:04:55,501
So it was you.

850
01:04:55,676 --> 01:04:57,881
We're on our way to get Calvin Wiggs.

851
01:04:58,052 --> 01:05:01,256
- And have him call the state police.
- I keep telling her there's no need.

852
01:05:01,723 --> 01:05:05,424
He's right and, besides, it'd be
indecent. Harry's dead and buried.

853
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:07,807
Sam, I've got something to tell you.

854
01:05:08,853 --> 01:05:10,930
You haven't dug him up again.

855
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:13,098
Well, I...

856
01:05:20,071 --> 01:05:22,312
(Miss Gravely)
I insisted, Mr Marlowe.

857
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:26,357
- Don't you understand?
- You have nothing to fear.

858
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:29,196
It's my concern entirely.

859
01:05:29,373 --> 01:05:33,237
As soon as Captain Wiles told me the
full circumstances of his being here

860
01:05:33,416 --> 01:05:35,493
I knew there was nothing for me
to hide.

861
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:37,744
You know all about Harry?

862
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,247
Well, I'm afraid I do, Mrs Rogers,
and...

863
01:05:40,424 --> 01:05:44,087
and after all, nobody could possibly
gossip about a lady and a maniac.

864
01:05:44,259 --> 01:05:46,337
You'd be surprised.

865
01:05:46,512 --> 01:05:49,262
You don't quite understand
what murder involves, Miss Gravely.

866
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:51,757
It'd be hours and hours
of questioning and photographs,

867
01:05:51,934 --> 01:05:54,768
and the whole of your private life
spread indecently in the newspapers.

868
01:05:57,102 --> 01:06:00,270
What makes you think
my private life is indecent?

869
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,226
I didn't mean that. I meant that
the way they pry is indecent.

870
01:06:03,317 --> 01:06:04,978
They'll hound you to death.

871
01:06:05,153 --> 01:06:07,228
There'll be newspapermen,
photographers, detectives.

872
01:06:07,404 --> 01:06:09,564
I've made up my mind.

873
01:06:09,741 --> 01:06:11,816
She certainly has.

874
01:06:11,992 --> 01:06:14,742
It was Captain Wiles here
who persuaded me to call

875
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:17,616
and tell Mrs Rogers
what I proposed to do.

876
01:06:17,788 --> 01:06:21,834
After all, she is most closely
connected with the business.

877
01:06:22,001 --> 01:06:24,372
What do you think about it,
Mrs Rogers?

878
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:27,795
I can't see why you're all
making such a fuss about Harry.

879
01:06:27,965 --> 01:06:31,248
If he was buried, I don't see
why you had to dig him up.

880
01:06:31,425 --> 01:06:34,510
But since you have, I guess
you'd better do what you think best.

881
01:06:34,678 --> 01:06:38,211
I don't care what you do with him,
as long as you don't revive him.

882
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:41,425
I have a free hand, then.

883
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,930
Free as a bird. As far as I'm
concerned, it's ancient history.

884
01:06:46,106 --> 01:06:48,180
Wait a minute, Jennifer.

885
01:06:48,357 --> 01:06:50,599
I think we've forgotten something.

886
01:06:50,777 --> 01:06:53,728
Do you realise if this comes out,
that all the details of your marriage

887
01:06:53,903 --> 01:06:56,193
will be public property?

888
01:06:57,574 --> 01:06:59,031
Oh.

889
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:04,276
- I hadn't thought of that either.
- Where'd you put Harry this time?

890
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:06,363
Over by the big oak tree.

891
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:10,908
- I'll get my shovel.
- I'm causing you a lot of hard work.

892
01:07:11,085 --> 01:07:13,290
- I'm sorry.
- Not at all, Not at all.

893
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,370
Well, let's all go up there.

894
01:07:17,798 --> 01:07:21,583
You know, I've never been to a
home-made funeral before. (Chuckles)

895
01:07:21,761 --> 01:07:24,251
Hm. I have.

896
01:07:24,428 --> 01:07:27,134
This is my third.

897
01:07:27,308 --> 01:07:31,140
All in one day. (Sighing)

898
01:07:31,311 --> 01:07:33,387
(Clock Chiming)

899
01:07:36,105 --> 01:07:39,273
(Sam) Well, let's get it over with.

900
01:07:39,443 --> 01:07:41,316
Yes.

901
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:55,577
(Captain)
I think we ought to cement it over.

902
01:07:55,749 --> 01:07:59,116
(Miss Gravely) Next spring
I'll set out some blueberry bushes.

903
01:07:59,293 --> 01:08:01,915
(Captain) Couldn't you make it
something else? Lilac, maybe.

904
01:08:02,087 --> 01:08:04,162
(Sam) I think nature'll
will take good care of it.

905
01:08:04,338 --> 01:08:07,957
- (Captain) How about a service?
- (Sam) I Can't think of what to say.

906
01:08:08,135 --> 01:08:11,133
- Besides, my arms ache.
- (Jennifer) It's late for a prayer.

907
01:08:11,302 --> 01:08:14,637
Besides, wherever he was going,
he's there now.

908
01:08:14,806 --> 01:08:17,213
Bye, Harry. I forgive you.

909
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:22,470
(Trumpet Sound)

910
01:08:26,108 --> 01:08:29,643
- (Captain) Trumpets welcoming Harry.
- (Jennifer) You didn't know Harry.

911
01:08:29,821 --> 01:08:33,733
(Sam) I want to paint you, Jennifer.
You're beautiful in the moonlight.

912
01:08:33,905 --> 01:08:35,567
(Trumpet Sound)

913
01:08:35,743 --> 01:08:37,817
(Captain) Sounds as if it's
coming down from near the village.

914
01:08:37,994 --> 01:08:41,743
(Miss Gravely) I know what it is.
The call of the phantom stagecoach

915
01:08:41,914 --> 01:08:44,748
that used to pass by here
each night 200 years ago.

916
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:49,494
- (Chuckling) Phantom ghost?
- The turnpike ran across the hills.

917
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:52,423
(Sam) Oh, to be a highwayman
on a night like this.

918
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:54,832
(Jennifer)
Listen. Somebody's running.

919
01:08:55,009 --> 01:08:57,711
- (Miss Gravely) Horses?
- (Sam) A horse that can shout.

920
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:00,840
- What's she saying?
- We'll know soon. She's coming here.

921
01:09:01,014 --> 01:09:05,759
- Sam Marlowe!
- It's Wiggy. Old Wiggy.

922
01:09:07,061 --> 01:09:09,135
Mr Marlowe!

923
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:11,934
Mr Marlowe!

924
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:15,475
- Wiggy, what on earth do you want?
- I... He wants...

925
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:17,857
- Wait a minute, Catch your breath.
- He's a millionaire!

926
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:21,146
- Who?
- He wants to buy your pictures.

927
01:09:21,322 --> 01:09:23,316
- Which pictures?
- All of 'em and more besides.

928
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,567
He says you're a genius.

929
01:09:25,743 --> 01:09:29,077
He's right, but it's hard to believe
he wants to buy all my pictures.

930
01:09:29,247 --> 01:09:31,701
(Miss Gravely) I'd be too curious
to refuse to at least to talk to him.

931
01:09:31,873 --> 01:09:34,200
(Wiggy) Don't turn down
a good chance, Mr Marlowe.

932
01:09:34,377 --> 01:09:36,783
All right, I'll talk to him.

933
01:09:38,212 --> 01:09:41,546
- (Captain) We dug sassafras root.
- (Wiggy) Sassafras tea is healthy.

934
01:09:41,715 --> 01:09:44,836
Mr Wiggs always swore it cured
his arthritis just before he died.

935
01:09:45,011 --> 01:09:47,086
(Captain) How much does
the millionaire want to pay?

936
01:09:47,263 --> 01:09:51,841
I said seven dollars for the one that
looks like blobs in a thunderstorm.

937
01:09:52,017 --> 01:09:54,092
- (Sam) And?
- He said they are priceless.

938
01:09:54,268 --> 01:09:57,223
(Captain) Priceless? Sounds like
something I painted in kindergarten.

939
01:09:57,397 --> 01:10:00,312
(Sam) That picture is symbolic
to the beginning of the world.

940
01:10:00,481 --> 01:10:03,056
(Captain) That's where I first heard
of the world, in kindergarten.

941
01:10:04,361 --> 01:10:07,977
Yes, and my friend here, art critic
for the modern museum, he -

942
01:10:08,156 --> 01:10:11,903
Don't think I'm rude, but it doesn't
matter to me what an art critic says.

943
01:10:12,075 --> 01:10:15,242
- Is that so?
- I know my paintings are good.

944
01:10:15,413 --> 01:10:18,779
He doesn't want them, you do. So
all that matters is what you think.

945
01:10:18,955 --> 01:10:23,664
Well, I think they are works of
genius, and I want to buy them all.

946
01:10:24,627 --> 01:10:27,001
- Too bad.
- Why?

947
01:10:27,173 --> 01:10:30,670
Just decided I can't sell them.
Besides, you couldn't afford them.

948
01:10:30,841 --> 01:10:32,918
Oh.

949
01:10:33,094 --> 01:10:35,880
- Uh...
- Money.

950
01:10:36,054 --> 01:10:39,887
Sammy. Don't be a fool.
Make him pay through the nose.

951
01:10:40,058 --> 01:10:43,011
Go ahead, Mr Marlowe, be reasonable.

952
01:10:43,187 --> 01:10:47,183
- Be unreasonable, if you want.
- What do you say?

953
01:10:50,485 --> 01:10:52,939
It's your genius, Sam.
It's up to you.

954
01:10:56,656 --> 01:11:00,105
All right then. What do you like most
in the whole world?

955
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:05,534
I don't know. Strawberries, I guess.

956
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,407
Strawberries. Write that down.

957
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:12,332
Two boxes of fresh strawberries, each
month, in season and out of season,

958
01:11:12,504 --> 01:11:14,542
from now on.

959
01:11:14,714 --> 01:11:16,788
(Millionaire)
Well, it's simple. What else?

960
01:11:16,965 --> 01:11:19,042
What would Arnie like?

961
01:11:20,594 --> 01:11:22,668
A chemical set.

962
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:25,882
- (Sam) What kind?
- Whatever smells the worst.

963
01:11:26,307 --> 01:11:28,381
- Got that?
- Right.

964
01:11:28,558 --> 01:11:31,264
One smelly chemical set.

965
01:11:31,436 --> 01:11:33,511
Wiggy, Wiggy, what would you like?

966
01:11:33,687 --> 01:11:35,978
Cash register, chromium plated,
one that rings a bell.

967
01:11:36,149 --> 01:11:38,520
- (Sam) Got room for one?
- I'll find room.

968
01:11:38,693 --> 01:11:41,396
- (Sam) Cash register.
- Chromium plated, rings a bell.

969
01:11:41,738 --> 01:11:43,279
Check.

970
01:11:43,447 --> 01:11:46,315
Miss Gravely,
a beauty parlour, fully equipped?

971
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:48,567
What for?

972
01:11:48,744 --> 01:11:53,489
A hope chest... filled with things
I should have put in it but didn't.

973
01:11:54,415 --> 01:11:57,249
A hope chest, full of hope.

974
01:11:57,708 --> 01:11:59,667
Captain?

975
01:11:59,837 --> 01:12:02,919
A good shotgun, plenty of ammunition,

976
01:12:03,088 --> 01:12:08,295
some corduroy britches, a plain shirt
and a hunting cap. A brown one.

977
01:12:09,635 --> 01:12:12,044
Davy Crockett, the works.

978
01:12:12,222 --> 01:12:14,296
Well, that's it, I guess.

979
01:12:14,473 --> 01:12:17,593
- The paintings are yours.
- Yes, but what about you?

980
01:12:17,769 --> 01:12:20,222
Yes, Sam,
you've gotta ask for something.

981
01:12:20,811 --> 01:12:22,889
Well, let's see.

982
01:12:24,982 --> 01:12:26,855
That's it.

983
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:29,729
What's it?

984
01:12:29,904 --> 01:12:31,776
Pardon me.

985
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:37,984
What do you think?

986
01:12:40,497 --> 01:12:43,781
Yes,
I think that can be easily arranged.

987
01:12:46,544 --> 01:12:48,619
Well. That's it, then.

988
01:12:48,794 --> 01:12:51,880
I'll come back in the morning
for all these paintings.

989
01:12:52,049 --> 01:12:53,957
Mr Marlowe,

990
01:12:54,133 --> 01:12:57,168
this has been a night that I shall
remember the rest of my life.

991
01:12:57,345 --> 01:13:00,261
Come back again. I'll have some more
paintings for you next month.

992
01:13:00,429 --> 01:13:03,716
And you'll have a steady customer
in me,

993
01:13:03,893 --> 01:13:06,429
even if you raise your prices.

994
01:13:06,602 --> 01:13:09,853
- Well, good night, everyone.
- (All) Good night.

995
01:13:10,022 --> 01:13:12,346
All right, young man.
(Millionaire Clears Throat)

996
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:19,685
(Captain) Congratulations, Sammy!
Good boy!

997
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:23,731
- (Sam) Did I do the right thing?
- You did just the right thing, Sam.

998
01:13:23,908 --> 01:13:25,983
Good.

999
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:29,325
Because it's important to me
that you think so.

1000
01:13:29,496 --> 01:13:31,488
Why?

1001
01:13:31,664 --> 01:13:34,583
Because I love you.
I want to marry you.

1002
01:13:36,169 --> 01:13:38,247
Oh! (Giggling)

1003
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,376
- You want to marry me?
- Uh-huh. Why not?

1004
01:13:45,553 --> 01:13:49,966
Well...
because I just got my freedom today.

1005
01:13:50,142 --> 01:13:52,547
Easy come, easy go.

1006
01:13:52,726 --> 01:13:56,889
Besides, if you married me,
you'd keep your freedom.

1007
01:13:57,730 --> 01:14:00,398
You must be practically unique, then.

1008
01:14:00,565 --> 01:14:04,397
I respect freedom.
More than that, I love freedom.

1009
01:14:04,569 --> 01:14:07,689
We might be the only free
married couple in the world.

1010
01:14:11,616 --> 01:14:14,108
This is very sudden, Sam.

1011
01:14:18,163 --> 01:14:21,284
You'll have to give me
a little time to think about it.

1012
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:25,374
Only fair. I'll give you
until we get back to your house.

1013
01:14:25,547 --> 01:14:26,661
(Door Opening)

1014
01:14:31,427 --> 01:14:34,959
- What's goin' on here at this hour?
- (Wiggy) The most wonderful thing.

1015
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,629
Mr Marlowe sold all his paintings
to a millionaire.

1016
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:40,213
- Got more'n I ever figured he'd get.
- Money?

1017
01:14:40,558 --> 01:14:42,635
Well, not exactly money.

1018
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:46,889
I always knew
they weren't worth the space.

1019
01:14:47,063 --> 01:14:50,729
I found these on a tramp
hangin' 'round here.

1020
01:14:50,901 --> 01:14:53,569
Said he found 'em on a... dead man.

1021
01:14:54,447 --> 01:14:57,564
Took me to where he said
he found him, and...

1022
01:14:58,991 --> 01:15:02,195
I didn't see any body.
(Ringing)

1023
01:15:04,662 --> 01:15:06,989
(Calvin) Montpelier 2000.

1024
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:09,833
- (Wiggy) That's the state police.
- (Calvin) Uh huh.

1025
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,789
I think, uh, we'd better get going.

1026
01:15:12,962 --> 01:15:15,333
(Wiggy)
Thank you for the cash register.

1027
01:15:15,505 --> 01:15:17,583
It was a pleasure. Good night.

1028
01:15:17,759 --> 01:15:19,797
Good night. Good night.

1029
01:15:19,968 --> 01:15:22,042
- Good night.
- Good night.

1030
01:15:22,219 --> 01:15:24,297
Good night, Captain.

1031
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:30,342
(Door Closes)
This is Deputy Sheriff Calvin Wiggs.

1032
01:15:30,519 --> 01:15:32,594
Yeah, I'll wait.

1033
01:15:48,409 --> 01:15:50,116
Ma?

1034
01:15:52,456 --> 01:15:54,328
Yes?

1035
01:15:54,498 --> 01:15:57,616
- This picture here on the floor.
- It's a new one.

1036
01:15:57,791 --> 01:16:00,248
He did it today,
but it isn't for sale.

1037
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,205
- Why not?
- You'll have to ask him that.

1038
01:16:03,379 --> 01:16:06,298
He left it on his way
over to Jennifer Roger's house.

1039
01:16:07,342 --> 01:16:10,178
Guess he didn't have time
to take it home.

1040
01:16:12,514 --> 01:16:14,719
You suddenly got interested in art?

1041
01:16:15,892 --> 01:16:17,683
No.

1042
01:16:17,852 --> 01:16:21,850
But... it's just that it matches
the description of -

1043
01:16:22,023 --> 01:16:24,429
Oh, hello, Sergeant.

1044
01:16:24,607 --> 01:16:26,682
Calvin Wiggs.

1045
01:16:26,858 --> 01:16:29,860
Got something
that might interest you a little.

1046
01:16:30,029 --> 01:16:33,648
It seems I picked up this tramp
with a pair of stolen shoes...

1047
01:16:33,825 --> 01:16:36,231
and a wild story about a corpse.

1048
01:16:56,845 --> 01:17:00,970
What do you think? Him walking in
with Harry Worp's shoes in his hand?

1049
01:17:01,138 --> 01:17:03,216
And then that phone call
to the police?

1050
01:17:03,392 --> 01:17:07,970
I don't know. I may be wrong, but I
don't think he's tied us into it yet.

1051
01:17:08,147 --> 01:17:10,221
Oh, the way he looked at me.

1052
01:17:10,398 --> 01:17:13,100
If he'd known anything,
he'd have kept us there.

1053
01:17:13,273 --> 01:17:17,485
But modern police methods
are all psychological now, Sammy.

1054
01:17:17,653 --> 01:17:22,315
They just wear you down
and wear you down until...

1055
01:17:22,491 --> 01:17:27,069
you're almost grateful
to get into that gas chamber.

1056
01:17:27,246 --> 01:17:32,240
The police would probably tell him,
if the shoes fit, to keep them.

1057
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:34,492
Oh, well.

1058
01:17:44,678 --> 01:17:47,712
- I've decided, Sam.
- Decided what?

1059
01:17:47,887 --> 01:17:52,549
I will marry you, if you haven't
forgotten about asking me.

1060
01:17:54,351 --> 01:17:57,602
I'm... I'm very fond of you and...

1061
01:17:57,771 --> 01:18:01,639
I think you'd make a good father
for Arnie.

1062
01:18:01,818 --> 01:18:06,062
And for some other reasons
best left unsaid.

1063
01:18:06,655 --> 01:18:09,358
Marriage is the comfortable way
to spend the winter,

1064
01:18:09,532 --> 01:18:12,285
but right now we should be
working on some good story

1065
01:18:12,452 --> 01:18:16,233
to satisfy the State Police
if they should turn up.

1066
01:18:16,412 --> 01:18:20,576
Would you believe it?
I'd almost forgotten that proposal.

1067
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:24,250
- I have witnesses, Sam.
- Oh, I remember now.

1068
01:18:24,421 --> 01:18:28,203
All right,
you've got yourself a husband.

1069
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:31,299
I think I'll kiss you now
to prove it.

1070
01:18:38,224 --> 01:18:41,973
Lightly, Sam.
I have a very short fuse.

1071
01:18:52,568 --> 01:18:55,025
What a pretty sight.

1072
01:19:01,201 --> 01:19:05,366
Sam, what did you ask
the millionaire for?

1073
01:19:07,832 --> 01:19:09,907
(No Audio)

1074
01:19:11,962 --> 01:19:14,249
That's very practical.

1075
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:22,085
- Congratulations, my dear.
- You're a lucky man, Sammy.

1076
01:19:22,263 --> 01:19:25,096
- I think you'll both be very happy.
- Thank you.

1077
01:19:25,264 --> 01:19:29,807
If I grumbled too much at my share of
the work in burying Harry, I'm sorry.

1078
01:19:29,977 --> 01:19:32,217
I can see now it was well worth it.

1079
01:19:32,395 --> 01:19:36,689
- And if I can do anything else -
- Hold it! Hold it, hold it!

1080
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:40,895
What's wrong, Sam?

1081
01:19:41,070 --> 01:19:44,070
Harry. We're not quite finished
with him yet.

1082
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:47,691
Sam, if anybody's through, it's
Harry. He's been buried three times.

1083
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:50,191
Before we can get married, you're
gonna have to prove that you're free.

1084
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:52,446
To prove you're free, you'll
have to prove that Harry -

1085
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:54,448
Is dead.

1086
01:19:55,415 --> 01:19:57,492
What a horrible complication.

1087
01:19:57,669 --> 01:19:59,743
Oh!

1088
01:20:01,045 --> 01:20:03,123
I don't know that it is.

1089
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:07,500
What are you looking at me for?
You...

1090
01:20:09,762 --> 01:20:12,430
Sammy, I'll do anything to help you,
but please,

1091
01:20:12,597 --> 01:20:15,219
please don't ask me to dig up
Harry again!

1092
01:20:15,392 --> 01:20:18,593
- Oh, come, come now, Captain.
- No, we can't.

1093
01:20:18,768 --> 01:20:21,605
- You're thinking of bad publicity -
- (Jennifer) No, I'm not.

1094
01:20:22,981 --> 01:20:26,730
I think Sam would be worth
just about anything.

1095
01:20:26,902 --> 01:20:29,392
I'm thinking of you, Miss Gravely.

1096
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:33,947
Murder is murder, no matter how
exonerating the circumstances.

1097
01:20:34,116 --> 01:20:36,819
It just wouldn't look nice at all
for you.

1098
01:20:36,992 --> 01:20:39,780
That's right!
Better let him stay where he is.

1099
01:20:39,954 --> 01:20:43,704
You'll only have to wait seven years
to presume death, anyway.

1100
01:20:43,876 --> 01:20:46,827
- Seven years! I'll be an old man.
- Don't be silly.

1101
01:20:47,002 --> 01:20:49,123
You waited far longer
than seven years already.

1102
01:20:49,297 --> 01:20:51,787
Yes, but now I know
what I'm waiting for.

1103
01:20:51,964 --> 01:20:54,454
(Miss Gravely) I insist that you dig
the wretched man up.

1104
01:20:54,632 --> 01:20:56,923
I don't care a hoot what they say.

1105
01:20:57,095 --> 01:21:00,543
They'd only have to know me to
realise the man must have been mad.

1106
01:21:00,721 --> 01:21:04,885
- I disagree! Huh!
- Really, Captain Wiles?

1107
01:21:05,934 --> 01:21:07,596
Well...

1108
01:21:08,896 --> 01:21:13,475
I'll dig him up but we'd better
get it done before Calvin Wiggs

1109
01:21:13,652 --> 01:21:16,934
gets the state police
snooping around here.

1110
01:21:22,949 --> 01:21:25,358
(Jennifer) I've been thinking.

1111
01:21:25,536 --> 01:21:28,784
I've been thinking maybe we could
forget the way it really happened.

1112
01:21:29,997 --> 01:21:33,117
I could tell how Harry visited me
and went off in such a rage today

1113
01:21:33,292 --> 01:21:35,782
and that's all we'd need to know
about his being there.

1114
01:21:35,962 --> 01:21:38,037
No, somebody else
might get the blame.

1115
01:21:38,213 --> 01:21:41,247
And somebody else might not
have such a good reason as I did.

1116
01:21:41,715 --> 01:21:44,386
What do you mean 'somebody else'?

1117
01:21:46,052 --> 01:21:50,430
I can think of two people with
a good reason for having killed him.

1118
01:21:50,974 --> 01:21:54,640
First you, because you married him.
And now Sam.

1119
01:21:54,812 --> 01:21:57,929
Me? Why would I want to kill him?
I never met him before.

1120
01:21:58,105 --> 01:22:00,644
You could still have a reason
for killing him.

1121
01:22:00,816 --> 01:22:02,855
- She means me.
- Yes.

1122
01:22:03,026 --> 01:22:06,443
I didn't fall in love with Jennifer
until after Harry was dead.

1123
01:22:06,614 --> 01:22:08,570
Try telling that to the police.

1124
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,814
She's right, Sammy boy.

1125
01:22:12,077 --> 01:22:16,285
On second thought, we'd better stick
to the truth, what there is of it.

1126
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:27,045
We must think up a reason why the
police weren't informed before now.

1127
01:22:27,213 --> 01:22:30,499
Yes, then there's the condition he's
in. That will take some explaining.

1128
01:22:31,259 --> 01:22:33,334
We'll just clean him up a bit.

1129
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:36,133
It's horrible,
but there's nothing else we can do.

1130
01:22:36,306 --> 01:22:38,795
We can't risk complicating
Miss Gravely's confession.

1131
01:22:38,973 --> 01:22:42,722
As for the delay, I can explain that
I was so upset by the occurrence

1132
01:22:42,894 --> 01:22:45,348
that I went straight home and rested.

1133
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,103
- Only natural.
- They'll think you had a long rest.

1134
01:22:49,275 --> 01:22:52,229
Sam, I'd rather not spend
the whole night debating.

1135
01:22:52,404 --> 01:22:54,893
Let's get Harry someplace
and clean him up.

1136
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:59,116
(Man Talking)
(Captain) Let's get out of here.

1137
01:23:10,044 --> 01:23:13,624
Love alters not
with his brief hours and weeks,

1138
01:23:13,796 --> 01:23:17,497
But bears it out
even to the edge of doom,

1139
01:23:17,674 --> 01:23:20,590
If this be error and upon me proved,

1140
01:23:20,759 --> 01:23:24,674
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

1141
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:38,687
I, uh, I think he met with a bit
of an accident, Dr Greenbow.

1142
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:40,936
He certainly did.

1143
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,398
Which of you found him?

1144
01:23:44,575 --> 01:23:47,359
- Well -
- He was my husband, Doctor.

1145
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:52,447
Oh, Mrs Rogers. I didn't know you
had a husband. I'm awfully sorry.

1146
01:23:53,622 --> 01:23:56,660
It's all right, Doctor.
It's just life, I guess.

1147
01:23:56,835 --> 01:23:59,371
- What happened to him?
- Well, he -

1148
01:23:59,543 --> 01:24:04,289
We want to know too. Can you say what
caused his death? It was so sudden.

1149
01:24:04,465 --> 01:24:07,037
In this light, my opinion
would be little more than a guess.

1150
01:24:07,216 --> 01:24:10,134
In that case, we could take him
someplace where you could see better.

1151
01:24:10,304 --> 01:24:13,638
All right, but I need my bag.
Where should we meet?

1152
01:24:13,808 --> 01:24:16,723
I'll take Harry home to my house.

1153
01:24:19,396 --> 01:24:21,885
Going home for the last time.

1154
01:24:27,610 --> 01:24:29,767
Better be the last time.

1155
01:24:30,195 --> 01:24:33,481
Come on, Sam. I've got
about one more trip left in me.

1156
01:24:33,657 --> 01:24:35,732
I'll get your coats.

1157
01:25:30,374 --> 01:25:32,863
I'll get the suspenders on.

1158
01:25:39,297 --> 01:25:43,508
I can't wait for this to be ready.
I'll have to iron it dry.

1159
01:25:44,426 --> 01:25:46,502
Isn't it odd?

1160
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:51,256
After refusing for so long, here
I am finally doing Harry's laundry.

1161
01:25:51,432 --> 01:25:53,509
(Groaning)

1162
01:26:10,034 --> 01:26:13,152
Ah!
(Whispers) Look.

1163
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:16,997
It's nothing to get excited about,
Captain.

1164
01:26:17,165 --> 01:26:19,535
It's only a closet door.

1165
01:26:20,166 --> 01:26:22,872
Oh. I thought it was Harry.

1166
01:26:23,045 --> 01:26:24,455
Relax, Captain.

1167
01:26:31,509 --> 01:26:34,925
What about the cut I made on his head
with my hiking shoe?

1168
01:26:35,097 --> 01:26:37,882
(Jennifer) Hmm.
I'll put some adhesive tape on it.

1169
01:26:38,056 --> 01:26:40,133
They'll think it was done
before he died.

1170
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:43,226
After the shirt's finished,
it should be just about everything.

1171
01:26:43,394 --> 01:26:45,270
(Car Approaching)

1172
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:47,810
- If that who I think it is -
- Calvin Wigg's car.

1173
01:27:01,493 --> 01:27:03,570
(Door Buzzer Buzzing)

1174
01:27:09,127 --> 01:27:11,202
(Buzzing)

1175
01:27:12,002 --> 01:27:14,709
(Jennifer) Just one second.

1176
01:27:18,341 --> 01:27:20,419
(Buzzer)

1177
01:27:23,179 --> 01:27:25,885
Well, Calvin Wiggs. What a surprise.

1178
01:27:26,059 --> 01:27:28,843
- Sam here?
- Yes, yes, yes, he's here.

1179
01:27:29,018 --> 01:27:31,092
Can I see him a minute?

1180
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:34,305
- Sam?
- Yeah?

1181
01:27:34,481 --> 01:27:38,266
- Calvin Wiggs is here to see you.
- Tell him I'll be right out.

1182
01:27:38,443 --> 01:27:41,893
- He says he'll be right out.
- Why don't I just go on in?

1183
01:27:47,533 --> 01:27:49,492
Evening, Calvin.

1184
01:27:49,662 --> 01:27:52,779
Evening, Captain Wiles.
Miss Gravely.

1185
01:27:52,955 --> 01:27:55,447
We've got 'em on the run
in four spades.

1186
01:27:55,626 --> 01:27:59,786
They should have been in diamonds.
Play much bridge?

1187
01:27:59,961 --> 01:28:02,453
- Never play it.
- That's what I thought.

1188
01:28:02,631 --> 01:28:04,337
Something you wanted, Calvin?

1189
01:28:04,839 --> 01:28:08,755
- Where were you today, Sam?
- Working, as usual.

1190
01:28:08,928 --> 01:28:11,761
Somewheres down
by Mansfield Meadows?

1191
01:28:12,682 --> 01:28:15,386
Possibly. I do quite a bit
of sketching around. Why?

1192
01:28:19,063 --> 01:28:21,349
Is that where, uh...

1193
01:28:23,356 --> 01:28:25,515
Where you painted this?

1194
01:28:27,777 --> 01:28:30,067
I left that portrait
with your mother.

1195
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:32,942
What right do you have to carry it
around with you? It might be damaged.

1196
01:28:33,115 --> 01:28:37,030
Yeah. It could be priceless,
and Sam would lose a sale.

1197
01:28:37,202 --> 01:28:39,952
Oh, I'll send him a box of
blueberries the first of every month.

1198
01:28:40,662 --> 01:28:43,867
Sam, what I wanna know is where'd
you paint it and who is it.

1199
01:28:44,459 --> 01:28:47,330
First of all, it's not a painting,
it's a drawing.

1200
01:28:47,504 --> 01:28:51,997
Matter of fact, it's a pastel and...
as for the model...

1201
01:28:52,172 --> 01:28:55,174
- It just came to me out of the blue.
- You don't say.

1202
01:28:55,343 --> 01:28:57,798
Why are you acting
like a deputy sheriff?

1203
01:28:57,969 --> 01:29:00,640
That tramp I picked up,
the one with the stolen shoes?

1204
01:29:00,807 --> 01:29:03,378
Said he got 'em off a dead man?

1205
01:29:03,558 --> 01:29:07,602
He described him very carefully. The
description fits the picture exactly.

1206
01:29:07,771 --> 01:29:11,520
A tramp who probably can't keep
his job and drinks too much.

1207
01:29:11,691 --> 01:29:14,062
I wouldn't think his word
was very reliable.

1208
01:29:14,859 --> 01:29:17,268
Got him locked up
in the schoolhouse.

1209
01:29:17,446 --> 01:29:19,901
- I took the painting to show him -
- Drawing, if you don't mind.

1210
01:29:20,072 --> 01:29:22,147
I took the drawing to show him.

1211
01:29:22,326 --> 01:29:24,400
He almost fainted.
Said it was the same face.

1212
01:29:24,577 --> 01:29:26,236
Where'd you paint it, Sam?

1213
01:29:28,581 --> 01:29:31,284
From my vast subconscious.

1214
01:29:31,457 --> 01:29:35,207
Sam, I hate to say this,
but I don't believe you.

1215
01:29:35,379 --> 01:29:37,453
With all this talk,
I've lost interest in the game.

1216
01:29:37,629 --> 01:29:39,872
If you'll forgive me,
I'll just run along home.

1217
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:42,172
I'll see you all tomorrow.

1218
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:47,551
What do you mean,
you don't believe me?

1219
01:29:48,222 --> 01:29:52,552
What I mean, Sam...
I ain't educated in fancy art...

1220
01:29:52,727 --> 01:29:56,638
but I do know the face of a dead
man when I see one, and this is it.

1221
01:29:56,811 --> 01:30:00,561
Calvin, perhaps I can
educate you to, um, 'fancy art.'

1222
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:05,483
See this -
Portrait of a sleeping face.

1223
01:30:05,654 --> 01:30:10,281
A man, relaxed,
far removed from earthly cares.

1224
01:30:10,450 --> 01:30:14,528
It was conceived out of memory
and half-forgotten impulse,

1225
01:30:14,705 --> 01:30:16,992
and it emerged from the shadows
of abstract emotions,

1226
01:30:17,164 --> 01:30:19,239
until it was born full-grown from...

1227
01:30:20,207 --> 01:30:22,332
the mechanical realities
of my fingertips.

1228
01:30:22,503 --> 01:30:25,122
- Oh, now Sam, don't -
- I don't need a model to draw from.

1229
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:27,870
Instead of creating a sleeping face,
I could have...

1230
01:30:28,049 --> 01:30:31,463
chosen an entirely different set
of artistic stimuli.

1231
01:30:31,633 --> 01:30:35,548
My subconscious is peopled
with enough faces to cover the Earth.

1232
01:30:35,722 --> 01:30:40,098
And the construction of the human
anatomy is so infinitely variable

1233
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:43,137
as to lie beyond the wildest powers
of calculation.

1234
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:47,356
Now, a raised eyelid, perhaps.

1235
01:30:50,486 --> 01:30:53,484
A line of fullness to the cheek.

1236
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:56,693
Lip that bends with expression.

1237
01:30:58,741 --> 01:31:00,484
There.

1238
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:05,948
- Sam, do you know what you just did?
- Certainly.

1239
01:31:06,122 --> 01:31:09,208
I just showed you how clearly
you misinterpreted my art.

1240
01:31:09,376 --> 01:31:11,249
You just destroyed legal evidence.

1241
01:31:13,714 --> 01:31:17,579
Calvin, it appears to me
you still don't understand.

1242
01:31:17,757 --> 01:31:20,594
I understand you made kind of a fool
out of me.

1243
01:31:20,762 --> 01:31:24,294
But I still got enough evidence
to know something funny's going on.

1244
01:31:24,471 --> 01:31:28,006
I ain't goin' to sleep
till I find out what it is.

1245
01:31:29,976 --> 01:31:32,469
(Jennifer) Good night, Calvin.

1246
01:31:35,564 --> 01:31:38,057
Hey! What's he doin' in our bathtub?

1247
01:31:43,156 --> 01:31:45,527
- That's where frogs belong.
- (Arnie) Oh.

1248
01:31:45,699 --> 01:31:48,950
- Back to bed, Arnie. Back to bed.
- State troopers here in the morning.

1249
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:52,617
I'm gonna want 'em to have a talk
with you, so be around.

1250
01:31:52,787 --> 01:31:55,410
- (Whispering) I said back to bed.
- You can find me in my studio.

1251
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:59,580
Just make sure.
(Knocking At Door)

1252
01:32:01,838 --> 01:32:03,711
Where is he?

1253
01:32:05,885 --> 01:32:08,919
He... he's in the bathroom
playing with his frog.

1254
01:32:10,845 --> 01:32:12,507
Oh?

1255
01:32:12,682 --> 01:32:15,966
Um... This way, please, Doctor.

1256
01:32:17,144 --> 01:32:19,219
It's Arnie. He's not very well.

1257
01:32:19,395 --> 01:32:21,470
(Car Horn Honking)

1258
01:32:23,275 --> 01:32:26,724
Someone must be foolin' around
with my car.

1259
01:32:36,494 --> 01:32:40,026
What are you playin'
with the horn for? It ain't your car.

1260
01:32:40,204 --> 01:32:42,910
Well, things are funny, you know?
(Chuckling)

1261
01:32:43,082 --> 01:32:46,333
Me and Miss Gravely might be in the
car market. We're looking for a car.

1262
01:32:46,503 --> 01:32:49,455
Yes. Had a look at this one.
It's a beauty.

1263
01:32:49,629 --> 01:32:51,704
I want to keep it that way.

1264
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:55,048
Now, now, that's not the way
to talk to a prospective customer.

1265
01:32:55,217 --> 01:32:59,631
You're no prospective customer.
You can't afford this car.

1266
01:33:11,024 --> 01:33:13,099
He's gone.

1267
01:33:13,274 --> 01:33:16,692
I put the little...
I put Arnie back to bed.

1268
01:33:16,863 --> 01:33:19,565
- What'd the doctor say?
- He said for me to get out.

1269
01:33:19,738 --> 01:33:23,689
I didn't like the look in his eye.
Something seems to be bothering him.

1270
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:29,945
Well, Captain,
did you get over being frightened?

1271
01:33:30,957 --> 01:33:32,783
Frightened?

1272
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:37,370
(Chuckling)
Oh, no, that's not why I left. No.

1273
01:33:37,546 --> 01:33:40,003
I'm not easily frightened,
you know. No.

1274
01:33:40,175 --> 01:33:43,955
Why, after all those years sailing
the four corners of the globe,

1275
01:33:44,134 --> 01:33:47,551
strange ports, a lot of rough men
and...

1276
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:54,262
Miss Gravely, what would you say...

1277
01:33:54,436 --> 01:33:56,513
if I told you...

1278
01:33:56,689 --> 01:33:59,522
I was only the captain
of a tugboat...

1279
01:33:59,691 --> 01:34:01,765
on the East River...

1280
01:34:01,942 --> 01:34:05,393
and never got more than a mile
or so off shore?

1281
01:34:11,909 --> 01:34:14,401
Well, I would say that...

1282
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:17,248
that you were the handsomest
tugboat captain

1283
01:34:17,414 --> 01:34:19,622
that ever sailed up the East River.

1284
01:34:21,544 --> 01:34:24,495
Oh, maybe not. No. (Chuckling)

1285
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:27,457
You want to see something?
Here. Here.

1286
01:34:29,466 --> 01:34:31,544
- Captain.
- Where'd you get those?

1287
01:34:32,053 --> 01:34:34,542
Calvin Wiggs' car.

1288
01:34:34,721 --> 01:34:36,878
I figured you were handling
half the evidence, Sammy,

1289
01:34:37,058 --> 01:34:39,132
so it was up to me
to take care of the rest.

1290
01:34:39,309 --> 01:34:41,135
You're the sweetest captain.

1291
01:34:43,730 --> 01:34:45,354
Why is he in the bath?

1292
01:34:45,522 --> 01:34:48,438
Well, uh...
What'd you find out, Doctor?

1293
01:34:48,609 --> 01:34:52,687
Oh, that.
It was his heart. He had a seizure.

1294
01:34:52,861 --> 01:34:56,480
- His heart?
- A seizure!

1295
01:34:56,657 --> 01:34:58,731
Well, I'll take a trip
to the Philippines!

1296
01:34:58,908 --> 01:35:01,745
- Death from natural causes.
- Well, certainly.

1297
01:35:02,204 --> 01:35:05,950
But will somebody tell me what he's
doin' in the bathtub half undressed?

1298
01:35:07,959 --> 01:35:11,741
Frankly, we didn't want
Calvin Wiggs to see him.

1299
01:35:13,005 --> 01:35:15,411
Besides, he was awful dirty
after we dug him up.

1300
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:17,880
Dug him up?

1301
01:35:18,052 --> 01:35:20,671
I'd better explain, Doctor, you see,

1302
01:35:20,845 --> 01:35:23,763
Harry's been buried and dug up
on and off all day long.

1303
01:35:23,932 --> 01:35:25,390
What?

1304
01:35:25,558 --> 01:35:28,129
Finally, he caused so many
complications that

1305
01:35:28,309 --> 01:35:31,594
we decided to clean him up
and put him back where we found him.

1306
01:35:31,771 --> 01:35:34,095
I don't understand you.
What complications?

1307
01:35:34,939 --> 01:35:37,016
Well, for example,

1308
01:35:37,193 --> 01:35:40,191
he upset Captain Wiles because the
captain thought he had shot him.

1309
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:44,026
The hole in the head. But as it
turned out, it wasn't the captain.

1310
01:35:44,198 --> 01:35:47,319
Miss Gravely hit him with the heel
of her shoe after he attacked her.

1311
01:35:47,786 --> 01:35:50,109
Captain Wiles attacked Miss Gravely?

1312
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:53,407
Oh, no, Doctor, Harry.

1313
01:35:53,582 --> 01:35:55,704
He dragged her into the bushes,
thinking it was me.

1314
01:35:56,416 --> 01:36:00,083
He was dazed, I supposed, after I hit
him on the head with a milk bottle.

1315
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:02,376
(Sighing)

1316
01:36:03,964 --> 01:36:06,919
The captain and Sam buried him first.

1317
01:36:07,093 --> 01:36:09,712
(Giggles)
The captain was so scared.

1318
01:36:09,886 --> 01:36:14,133
Then he accounted for all his
bullets, so up Harry came.

1319
01:36:14,307 --> 01:36:16,550
Then Miss Gravely thought her shoe
was responsible for it so -

1320
01:36:16,727 --> 01:36:18,802
- Shoe?
- So the captain,

1321
01:36:18,978 --> 01:36:22,847
rather gallantly, I thought,
pushed him back in again.

1322
01:36:23,024 --> 01:36:26,356
Then he was out and back and...
I can't remember why.

1323
01:36:26,526 --> 01:36:29,397
But anyway, he's out again now
because Sam and I wanna get married.

1324
01:36:29,863 --> 01:36:33,731
- Yeah. But why did you -
- Hit him on the head?

1325
01:36:34,451 --> 01:36:38,067
That wouldn't interest you.
It's purely personal and non-medical.

1326
01:36:38,245 --> 01:36:41,412
Besides, it's awfully late, so if
you'll keep quiet about all this,

1327
01:36:41,581 --> 01:36:43,656
we'll put Harry back in the morning,
nice and clean,

1328
01:36:43,832 --> 01:36:45,910
and no one will be any the wiser.

1329
01:36:46,086 --> 01:36:48,161
And then we'll be rid of all these
sticky complications.

1330
01:36:48,336 --> 01:36:50,909
Put him back, put him back,
that's all.

1331
01:36:51,091 --> 01:36:54,920
This is the first nightmare
I've had in 25 years.

1332
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:00,254
He's kinda strange, isn't he?

1333
01:37:05,811 --> 01:37:07,683
(Giggling)

1334
01:37:07,853 --> 01:37:10,605
Well, um,
hadn't we better get Harry dressed?

1335
01:37:10,773 --> 01:37:12,848
Yes, yes.

1336
01:37:20,533 --> 01:37:22,275
Couldn't Arnie find him again?

1337
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:25,403
Then he'd run home and tell me,
and then I'd phone Calvin Wiggs.

1338
01:37:25,576 --> 01:37:28,579
Yes! Arnie could explain
quite clearly to Calvin -

1339
01:37:28,747 --> 01:37:32,580
- That he found Harry tomorrow.
- You mean today.

1340
01:37:32,752 --> 01:37:35,667
But to Arnie, tomorrow is yesterday.

1341
01:37:37,004 --> 01:37:40,124
Let's go get Harry. Come on, Captain.

1342
01:37:48,513 --> 01:37:51,136
(Birds Chirping)

1343
01:37:53,435 --> 01:37:55,513
Here he comes.

1344
01:38:15,038 --> 01:38:17,112
Go on, Arnie.
Run home and tell me about it.

1345
01:38:17,289 --> 01:38:19,366
Don't touch him.

1346
01:38:19,542 --> 01:38:21,616
Please, Arnie, run home
and tell your mother.

1347
01:38:21,793 --> 01:38:23,868
Beat it, you little creep!

1348
01:38:24,044 --> 01:38:26,204
I mean, hurry home, son.

1349
01:38:36,808 --> 01:38:39,131
Captain, you never told me
your first name.

1350
01:38:39,308 --> 01:38:41,383
Albert. What's yours?

1351
01:38:41,559 --> 01:38:45,225
Ivy. Albert, let's go.

1352
01:38:45,397 --> 01:38:47,770
Just a minute, ma'am.
I want to ask Sam something.

1353
01:38:47,943 --> 01:38:52,020
Sam, what did you ask the millionaire
to bring you?

1354
01:38:54,365 --> 01:38:56,439
(No Audio)

1355
01:38:56,615 --> 01:38:58,689
(Chuckling)

1356
01:38:58,866 --> 01:39:00,943
Albert, what was it?

1357
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:04,788
(Whispering) A double bed.
