1
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:30,499
Griet.

2
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:36,968
Leave that.

3
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:52,413
- Griet?
- Father.

4
00:02:11,377 --> 00:02:13,140
Do you remember?

5
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:14,976
You watched me paint it.

6
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,260
I never thought our family would come to this.

7
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:42,102
Food may be strange to your stomach.

8
00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:49,012
Keep clear of their Catholic prayers.

9
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:52,506
Or if you must be with them when they pray...

10
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:54,042
stop your ears.

11
00:04:08,294 --> 00:04:10,762
Give it.
I got Cornelia's too.

12
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:12,991
- Give it back.
- Stop it!

13
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:17,566
You did not get it.
I did.

14
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:20,037
Do you know the house of Master Vermeer?

15
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:23,200
Tell Tanneke the new maid is here.

16
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:48,132
You took your time.
Lose your way, did you?

17
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:52,667
Young mistress is out this morning.

18
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:55,172
I'm to show you round.

19
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:58,074
Water for the table.

20
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:02,176
Take water from the canal for laundry.

21
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:04,079
It's clean enough this side of town.

22
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:08,583
Soda...
coppers, boiler...

23
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,452
sand and soap.

24
00:05:10,489 --> 00:05:12,980
In cooking kitchen you're to help
serve and clear,

25
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:14,822
buy fish and meat...

26
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,454
when young mistress don't want to.

27
00:05:17,496 --> 00:05:19,930
You'll take your meals with me and the children.

28
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:24,091
That's your sleeping place.

29
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,166
Scour the pots and pans.

30
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,732
Young mistress and master sleep
and have company here.

31
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,779
You'll get used to it.

32
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:42,444
You're to clean in there.

33
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:46,915
Not now!

34
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,291
He's painting.

35
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:01,187
Good morning, madam.

36
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:04,620
Don't speak till you're spoken to.

37
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:09,194
Tanneke showed you what needs
to be done? The laundry and so on?

38
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:10,532
Yes, madam.

39
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:14,938
This is only a trial.
Nothing is settled yet.

40
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:41,029
I...

41
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,034
my husband does...

42
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,332
Go in.

43
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,378
Go in.

44
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:33,852
Disturb nothing.

45
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:36,047
Leave all just as it is.

46
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:42,320
Open the shutters, you can't work in the dark.

47
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:44,246
You're not the first to forget
your manners in front of his paintings.

48
00:11:46,518 --> 00:11:47,917
<i>Tell me, girl...</i>

49
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:50,717
do you think it finished?

50
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:54,657
Three months.

51
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:57,958
Another three before he's satisfied, no doubt.

52
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:01,461
Well get along, girl.

53
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,730
You're not paid to stand gawping all day.

54
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:12,236
Good to see you.

55
00:12:12,277 --> 00:12:14,245
Are you well?
Yeah.

56
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:20,910
- Can we go?
- Here's my man.

57
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:22,443
Paul.

58
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:24,649
This is Griet, the new maid.

59
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,850
She'll fetch the meat now.

60
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:26,983
So, Griet...

61
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,822
what takes your fancy?

62
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:30,795
Nothing is too good for this family?

63
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:33,297
An ox tongue and a dozen chops.

64
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:34,959
Pieter...

65
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,900
chops...

66
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:38,926
In the book again?

67
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:45,110
There you are.

68
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:54,309
This meat's not fresh.

69
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:00,453
The mistress won't like it.

70
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:03,485
Pieter.

71
00:13:07,132 --> 00:13:09,123
Get the parcel on the cart.

72
00:13:26,618 --> 00:13:27,846
That's better.

73
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:31,319
We'll see you again, Griet.

74
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:32,584
Yes.

75
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,024
No!

76
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:44,695
I'll take that.

77
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:48,540
Make way now.

78
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,077
- What is it?
- Bankrupt.

79
00:13:54,112 --> 00:13:58,048
They've lived next door
for as long as I can remember.

80
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:01,581
The shame.

81
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:04,413
Lost everything.

82
00:14:06,358 --> 00:14:08,986
Watch out for young mistress.

83
00:14:09,027 --> 00:14:10,619
She hates money troubles.

84
00:14:12,464 --> 00:14:15,228
She'll turn spiteful at this, you mark my words.

85
00:14:20,305 --> 00:14:24,241
The last time you said it was
done you kept it another six months!

86
00:14:24,276 --> 00:14:25,641
It will be done soon.

87
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:28,544
Oh yes, soon.
But when is soon?

88
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,639
Next month, next year?

89
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:32,013
It's all the same to you,

90
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,985
if your children starve
and your wife is dressed in rags.

91
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,682
When you sit up there
and suck at your paintbrush...

92
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:39,384
You're being ridiculous.
I'm going out.

93
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:41,585
No, Jan, don't you dare leave.

94
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:49,260
One year it got so bad,
they had to sell some of their jewels.

95
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:53,897
You could imagine how that pleased her.

96
00:14:53,972 --> 00:14:55,997
She smashed half the china...

97
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:58,770
went to spoil one of his precious paintings.

98
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,144
Well, he's a temper on him too
for all he's so quiet.

99
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:11,550
She's not set so much as a foot
in his studio from that day to this.

100
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:02,973
There you are.
Fetch some water.

101
00:16:03,008 --> 00:16:04,373
Hail Mary, Mother of God,

102
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:06,809
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.

103
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:09,973
Six babies. Why does
she have to make such a racket?

104
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:11,448
Just get on with the work.

105
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:12,711
Push!

106
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:18,414
I need more rags, girl.

107
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:19,981
More rags.

108
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:27,989
Push, push!

109
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:30,228
Good, that's good!

110
00:16:31,436 --> 00:16:34,030
Oh, Jan, isn't he just like you?

111
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:37,334
Johannes, that's it.

112
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:39,877
Look at him, he's your little brother.

113
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:56,020
Take this to the house of your master's
patron, Pieter van Ruijven.

114
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:18,272
To the left.

115
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:20,944
Open up, there's a lady coming in.

116
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:23,820
That's it.

117
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:31,587
So, finished at last.

118
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,296
Honored guest.

119
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:40,498
It's the old woman's idea to combine
the birth feast and the viewing.

120
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:42,267
She is a tight fist.

121
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:47,470
I won't turn out
for small beer and biscuits, tell her.

122
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:49,571
Me and the brat deserve a proper feast.

123
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:57,115
You have a very wide eyes.

124
00:17:57,155 --> 00:17:59,589
What do they call you?

125
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:03,458
- Griet.
- Griet?

126
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:05,895
Griet.

127
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:13,069
Your master is a fine painter, Griet.

128
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:15,834
The finest in Delft.

129
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:16,874
He's painted me.

130
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:20,809
Perhaps that will be my epitaph.

131
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:30,346
Look at that dress.

132
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:32,720
You can almost stroke the satin.

133
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:35,851
And the wine winkling through the glass.

134
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:41,294
Can you imagine yourself in such finery, Griet?

135
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:46,562
She loved it, you know.

136
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:50,404
Lace and satin pressed tight
against the plump little bubbies.

137
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:55,379
The silk, heavy on her thighs.

138
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:57,108
The gentlemen watching.

139
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:01,343
My God, she was happy.

140
00:19:01,386 --> 00:19:03,581
She thought she was somebody.

141
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:05,647
All dressed up like a lady.

142
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:09,423
Green as grass, mind you.

143
00:19:11,663 --> 00:19:13,290
She had only worked there a few months

144
00:19:13,331 --> 00:19:16,823
before Master Van Ruijven
brought her over to be painted.

145
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:20,531
Got her into that fine red dress.

146
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:25,075
Poured wine down her
like he was forcing a goose.

147
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,543
That dress can't have stayed on long.

148
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:30,878
She was carrying his by-blow
before the painting was dry.

149
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:39,522
He thinks we don't know
how to celebrate a birth, does he?

150
00:20:01,746 --> 00:20:02,940
Come on, keep up.

151
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:14,580
Come on now, my little one.
I've got a lovely apple for you.

152
00:20:14,626 --> 00:20:16,787
The price was three guilders, I'm sure of that.

153
00:20:16,828 --> 00:20:20,264
Three guilders...
thank you.

154
00:20:53,331 --> 00:20:54,821
Why are you here?

155
00:20:56,501 --> 00:21:00,460
A nice greeting, when I brought
the meat order just for you.

156
00:21:00,505 --> 00:21:02,370
Better carry it through.

157
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:08,268
Not even a smile for my pains?

158
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:10,371
Not today.

159
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:13,010
Come on.

160
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:19,115
I'll put it in the book, then.
Owed by Griet...

161
00:21:19,157 --> 00:21:21,352
one smile.

162
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:42,312
And don't they look marvelous?

163
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:51,712
Welcome, Master Van Ruijven.

164
00:21:51,756 --> 00:21:53,053
Mistress Thins.

165
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:18,680
Friends and neighbors,

166
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:21,686
our honored guest, Master Van Ruijven...

167
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,483
not only are we gathered tonight

168
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:26,115
to celebrate the safe delivery into this world,

169
00:22:26,157 --> 00:22:29,354
praise be to God, of little Franciscus,

170
00:22:30,795 --> 00:22:34,424
but also to rejoice at another birth,

171
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:39,267
a new masterpiece
from the hand of my son-in-law

172
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:41,168
Johannes Vermeer.

173
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,425
Is this Indian yellow?

174
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:16,296
Distilled from the urine of sacred cows

175
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:18,865
fed only on mango leaves.

176
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,313
You've glazed my wife in dried piss.

177
00:23:30,121 --> 00:23:31,383
It was the right color.

178
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:33,414
No stinting, eh?

179
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:41,194
I cannot bear the suspense
a moment longer, Master Van Ruijven.

180
00:23:41,232 --> 00:23:43,291
Pray tell us what you think.

181
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:45,802
This is good.

182
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:51,672
Color and perspective is true,
the illusion... is perfect.

183
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,406
All this skill lavished on my dear Emilie.

184
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:00,475
Why...

185
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:05,115
it's almost as if...
she were thinking.

186
00:24:05,156 --> 00:24:08,648
And have you considered
the subject for your next commission?

187
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:11,890
We cannot expect you to give up Emilie
for so long again.

188
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,421
Considered? It's already in hand.
Didn't I tell you?

189
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:16,627
A coming fellow from Amsterdam.

190
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:19,228
Studied under Rembrandt van Rijn,

191
00:24:19,304 --> 00:24:20,828
though, who hasn't these days?

192
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:28,410
"A Merry Company by Candlelight,"
candlelight being his forte.

193
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:34,116
So, have you decided what to daub next, Jan?

194
00:24:34,152 --> 00:24:37,246
Have you found inspiration up
in that room of yours?

195
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:42,659
Is there another patron in Delft
with pockets as deep as mine?

196
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:45,060
I've not yet found a subject.

197
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,909
Yes?

198
00:25:42,954 --> 00:25:44,888
About the studio, mistress.

199
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:48,253
Should I clean the windows?

200
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:50,853
You don't need to ask me about such matters.

201
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:51,884
It's just...

202
00:25:54,365 --> 00:25:56,492
it may change the light.

203
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:06,207
Of course.

204
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:08,812
Wash them.

205
00:26:57,362 --> 00:26:59,455
Stay as you were.

206
00:27:06,037 --> 00:27:07,265
By the window.

207
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:19,573
Drop it.

208
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:29,715
Just...

209
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,730
You can go.

210
00:28:30,888 --> 00:28:32,583
Brothers and sisters...

211
00:28:32,623 --> 00:28:35,285
welcome to the house of the Lord God.

212
00:28:35,326 --> 00:28:38,853
Let us lift up our hearts and voices together

213
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:42,388
to give Him thanks and praise
for our safe passage...

214
00:28:57,482 --> 00:29:00,883
Father, mother, this is Pieter,

215
00:29:00,918 --> 00:29:04,217
our butcher's son...
the family's butcher.

216
00:29:04,255 --> 00:29:06,689
Sir, mistress, I'm glad to meet you.

217
00:29:06,724 --> 00:29:11,252
So, the butcher...
that's a good trade.

218
00:29:11,295 --> 00:29:14,696
Griet is the hardest to please
of all our customers.

219
00:29:14,732 --> 00:29:18,498
Aye, she gets that from me.

220
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:22,430
There now, I forgot.

221
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:24,498
We must speak with Willem Jansson.

222
00:29:24,575 --> 00:29:27,373
Griet, you go on with Pieter there.

223
00:29:34,585 --> 00:29:36,314
Good morning.
- So Griet...

224
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:38,788
where is that smile you owe me,

225
00:29:38,823 --> 00:29:41,485
when I have been so clever as to track you down?

226
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:47,129
You had nothing better to do.

227
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:00,304
Shocking.
She should know better.

228
00:30:00,344 --> 00:30:01,811
She should at her age.

229
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:08,710
When I saw you with Tanneke I thought
you were a little Catholic girl.

230
00:30:16,427 --> 00:30:18,452
He started a new painting.

231
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:22,598
There's no buyer.

232
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:25,124
He won't even let me see it.

233
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:27,034
But he's working again.

234
00:30:27,104 --> 00:30:29,402
It usually takes him longer.

235
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:16,018
Good.

236
00:31:20,024 --> 00:31:23,152
Very good.
Keep it level all the time.

237
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,039
Do you know what it is?

238
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:20,947
A camera obscura.

239
00:32:35,466 --> 00:32:36,763
Look into the glass.

240
00:32:50,414 --> 00:32:52,382
Here. Put this on.

241
00:33:04,628 --> 00:33:05,959
You can see?

242
00:33:11,702 --> 00:33:14,466
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- No, don't worry about the robe.

243
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:15,869
What did you see?

244
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,072
I saw the painting.

245
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:25,139
But...

246
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:31,950
how did it get in there?

247
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:37,617
See this?

248
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:40,890
This is called "a lens."

249
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:44,458
Beams of reflected light
from that corner pass through it...

250
00:33:45,703 --> 00:33:48,228
into the box...
so that we can see it here.

251
00:33:48,305 --> 00:33:50,136
Is it real?

252
00:33:50,174 --> 00:33:52,404
It's an image.

253
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:56,072
A picture made of light.

254
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:00,743
Does the box show you what to paint?

255
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:09,851
It helps.

256
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:20,228
You didn't get me.
I got you.

257
00:34:20,304 --> 00:34:21,669
No, you're cheating.

258
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,707
Oh, do we have to play this?

259
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:26,100
So...

260
00:34:27,645 --> 00:34:30,011
Stop it.
Oh, look Cornelia.

261
00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:31,275
There.

262
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:33,477
Now you're it.

263
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:36,679
- I've got it.
- I've got it.

264
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,709
Yes I can.

265
00:34:37,755 --> 00:34:39,154
- No way.
- It's mine.

266
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,715
- No.
- I'll catch it.

267
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:43,283
Cornelia!

268
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:49,132
I won't tell you again.

269
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:51,493
Girls, come inside.

270
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:54,561
- Why?
- Come on. Don't make a fuss.

271
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,203
It's dirty now.

272
00:36:43,747 --> 00:36:45,908
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Shh...

273
00:36:53,023 --> 00:36:54,513
Stay.

274
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:21,279
Lead white.

275
00:37:26,423 --> 00:37:29,221
From the cupboard.

276
00:38:06,297 --> 00:38:08,288
Please let me see your hair.

277
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,668
What color is it?

278
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:15,363
Brown.

279
00:38:17,775 --> 00:38:18,764
Straight or curly?

280
00:38:20,878 --> 00:38:22,106
Neither.

281
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:23,875
Long?

282
00:38:23,914 --> 00:38:27,372
- Very long?
- No.

283
00:38:31,622 --> 00:38:33,886
My mother will expect me home.

284
00:38:33,924 --> 00:38:36,415
She knows where you are, Griet.

285
00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:54,171
You're looking at it?

286
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:58,580
Well...

287
00:38:58,615 --> 00:39:01,846
Nothing is the right color.

288
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:05,220
This is the base color.

289
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:07,883
It gives the tone...

290
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:10,553
shadow in the light.

291
00:39:10,594 --> 00:39:12,619
And when it's dry...

292
00:39:12,663 --> 00:39:14,858
I glaze over it with blue, but...

293
00:39:14,898 --> 00:39:17,662
thinly, so that the black shows through.

294
00:39:27,444 --> 00:39:28,604
Look, Griet.

295
00:39:30,814 --> 00:39:31,974
Look at the clouds.

296
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:37,084
What color are they?

297
00:39:43,394 --> 00:39:44,759
White?

298
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,890
No...
not white.

299
00:39:57,374 --> 00:39:58,739
Yellow.

300
00:40:02,346 --> 00:40:05,213
Blue...
and grey.

301
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:09,285
There are colors in the clouds.

302
00:40:16,827 --> 00:40:18,795
Now you understand.

303
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:43,518
Thinking about your butcher boy?

304
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:14,039
Come.

305
00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:19,419
This... is ruby shellac.

306
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:29,864
Gum arabic.

307
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:35,802
Wine skin.

308
00:41:40,744 --> 00:41:42,905
This will make verdigris.

309
00:41:44,748 --> 00:41:46,272
Malachite.

310
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,749
Vermilion.

311
00:41:57,928 --> 00:41:59,691
That...

312
00:42:01,398 --> 00:42:02,660
linseed oil.

313
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:06,029
Bone black.

314
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:08,970
An you grind it with a muller, like this.

315
00:42:18,515 --> 00:42:19,743
You try.

316
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:36,193
Twist from the shoulder.

317
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:40,127
It's like this.

318
00:43:24,948 --> 00:43:27,508
Griet!

319
00:43:28,385 --> 00:43:29,374
The child needs a draught.

320
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:35,822
My mother will not be content
till one of them dies from her meanness.

321
00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:36,848
Come on.

322
00:43:36,893 --> 00:43:39,487
You will need...

323
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:50,434
On the master's account.

324
00:44:04,054 --> 00:44:06,022
- Griet.
- Sir?

325
00:44:07,891 --> 00:44:10,018
I want you to get something for me, too.

326
00:44:11,294 --> 00:44:12,784
I want some colors.

327
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:17,898
My wife need not know.

328
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:26,032
This is too thin.

329
00:45:47,924 --> 00:45:49,391
Did you get the lapis?

330
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,359
You can mix the colors.

331
00:45:57,534 --> 00:45:58,660
Mix the colors?

332
00:46:00,103 --> 00:46:01,764
Sir, I haven't time.

333
00:46:03,306 --> 00:46:05,274
Make time.

334
00:46:36,373 --> 00:46:37,533
Nurse!

335
00:46:37,607 --> 00:46:41,008
- Nurse.
I'm coming.

336
00:46:44,881 --> 00:46:47,816
Nurse! Come on!
Quickly.

337
00:47:19,382 --> 00:47:22,078
How much longer is the wet nurse
to be with us, mistress?

338
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,710
I don't know.

339
00:47:24,754 --> 00:47:26,984
A month or so.

340
00:47:27,023 --> 00:47:29,184
No, Cornelia, not my pearls.

341
00:47:29,226 --> 00:47:30,818
A month or more.

342
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:34,853
Why?

343
00:47:34,898 --> 00:47:36,923
What's it to you?

344
00:47:36,967 --> 00:47:39,765
Well, she's eating us out of house
and home for a start.

345
00:47:39,803 --> 00:47:42,294
She must eat for the baby.

346
00:47:42,372 --> 00:47:46,604
All I'm saying is, I can't cook
twice as much and have no sleep at all.

347
00:47:46,643 --> 00:47:48,873
Tell her to be quiet, then.

348
00:47:48,912 --> 00:47:51,278
If I could just go back to the cellar...

349
00:47:51,314 --> 00:47:52,679
Well, you can't.

350
00:47:55,452 --> 00:47:57,181
Griet has your place.

351
00:48:03,793 --> 00:48:05,351
Why not move Tanneke back?

352
00:48:11,101 --> 00:48:13,160
Put a mattress in the attic for Griet.

353
00:48:13,236 --> 00:48:15,568
Tanneke can sleep soundly...

354
00:48:16,773 --> 00:48:20,004
and Griet can clean the studio
before she comes down in the morning.

355
00:48:24,614 --> 00:48:25,945
My jewels.

356
00:48:28,418 --> 00:48:30,443
You always have my jewels up there to paint.

357
00:48:31,488 --> 00:48:32,716
She...

358
00:48:34,057 --> 00:48:35,422
You lock up at night,

359
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:37,323
open it in the morning.

360
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,674
There.
Are you satisfied, Tanneke?

361
00:48:52,709 --> 00:48:54,176
Yes, mistress.

362
00:50:21,464 --> 00:50:22,931
Got it.
I win again.

363
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:24,558
No, we are drawing.

364
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:26,694
- Well, I do.
- No you don't.

365
00:50:31,274 --> 00:50:33,799
No need to go to the fish market tomorrow.

366
00:50:33,877 --> 00:50:36,311
Mistress wants eggs.

367
00:50:40,483 --> 00:50:42,110
No...

368
00:50:42,152 --> 00:50:46,054
she cannot abide the smell
when she's with child.

369
00:50:51,127 --> 00:50:52,788
So soon?

370
00:50:52,829 --> 00:50:55,195
As if there weren't enough mouths
to feed already.

371
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,189
Still...

372
00:50:59,502 --> 00:51:00,935
what can you do, eh?

373
00:51:02,572 --> 00:51:03,561
Men.

374
00:51:43,613 --> 00:51:45,410
Marvelous.

375
00:51:47,517 --> 00:51:49,781
No, Jan.

376
00:55:56,032 --> 00:55:57,897
Why did you move the chair?

377
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,498
She looked trapped.

378
00:56:26,829 --> 00:56:27,853
Griet!

379
00:56:29,365 --> 00:56:30,923
Are you up there?

380
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:50,946
One of my tortoiseshell combs is gone.

381
00:57:04,834 --> 00:57:07,132
She's nothing but trouble.

382
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:15,407
Master, I did not do it.

383
00:57:19,515 --> 00:57:21,380
Help me.

384
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:34,121
Please.
Let me look for you.

385
00:57:35,164 --> 00:57:36,290
Papa?

386
00:57:36,332 --> 00:57:38,857
- Father?
Don't!

387
00:57:38,901 --> 00:57:41,028
Leave it alone. I'll find it.
Please, sir.

388
00:57:41,103 --> 00:57:43,264
What's going on?
What are you doing?

389
00:57:46,742 --> 00:57:48,232
Stop it!

390
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:49,505
For heaven's sake,

391
00:57:49,545 --> 00:57:51,274
you're scaring the children.

392
00:57:54,183 --> 00:57:55,548
What are you doing?

393
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,362
Cornelia.

394
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:37,020
She's dishonest.

395
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:39,823
Always sneaking around.
Shirking her work.

396
00:58:42,064 --> 00:58:44,259
Tanneke has complained of it.

397
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,461
Creeping upstairs all day long.

398
00:58:46,502 --> 00:58:51,030
My daughter is right,
there has been too much sneaking about.

399
00:58:51,107 --> 00:58:53,166
I only took her out of charity.

400
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:56,177
- If I thought she'd be...
- With another child due

401
00:58:56,212 --> 00:58:57,941
we need the extra help.

402
00:58:58,981 --> 00:59:00,073
Fit in all your work

403
00:59:00,116 --> 00:59:03,574
and do not slack
or it will be the worst for you.

404
00:59:05,121 --> 00:59:07,419
I shall invite Master Van Ruijven.

405
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:10,425
Johannes must have a new commission.

406
00:59:12,828 --> 00:59:14,193
Get back to work.

407
00:59:37,186 --> 00:59:39,279
All these girls.

408
00:59:39,322 --> 00:59:42,849
The boys will soon
be swarming around like flies.

409
00:59:42,892 --> 00:59:45,087
I tell you, if I was a few years younger...

410
00:59:45,127 --> 00:59:48,460
A connoisseur in everything, Master Van Ruijven.

411
00:59:48,497 --> 00:59:53,696
But you should be faithful
to one mistress above all others...

412
00:59:55,004 --> 00:59:56,596
Art.

413
00:59:56,672 --> 01:00:00,608
Your name will surely be famed
as one of the great patrons.

414
01:00:00,676 --> 01:00:04,009
With your exquisite taste,

415
01:00:04,046 --> 01:00:08,039
your subtle understanding
of allegory and allusion...

416
01:00:08,084 --> 01:00:11,713
No, no, stop it, stop it. My God, woman,
you could sell sour milk to cows.

417
01:00:11,754 --> 01:00:14,188
Now what is it you want?

418
01:00:14,223 --> 01:00:15,781
A group painting.

419
01:00:15,825 --> 01:00:18,385
Yourself and Emilie.

420
01:00:18,427 --> 01:00:20,520
Your lovely daughter too.

421
01:00:22,031 --> 01:00:23,760
Or...

422
01:00:23,799 --> 01:00:26,097
a merry company.

423
01:00:26,135 --> 01:00:27,864
Wine...

424
01:00:27,937 --> 01:00:29,871
a good meal on your table.

425
01:00:29,905 --> 01:00:32,874
Your friends all about.
Music.

426
01:00:32,908 --> 01:00:36,071
- And dancing.
- It's better. Better, better.

427
01:00:36,112 --> 01:00:37,579
I'll take your bait.

428
01:00:37,647 --> 01:00:39,945
The picture, several figures.

429
01:00:39,982 --> 01:00:44,316
A merry gathering, but no family portrait.

430
01:00:44,353 --> 01:00:49,518
And if I'm to spend tedious hours sitting

431
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:53,085
I want something I can rest my eyes on.

432
01:00:53,129 --> 01:00:55,962
I think she ought to be in the painting.

433
01:00:56,999 --> 01:00:59,467
A tavern scene.
It will make a change for you.

434
01:00:59,502 --> 01:01:02,403
Griet could come and serve me.

435
01:01:05,074 --> 01:01:06,439
Look at her, man.

436
01:01:06,475 --> 01:01:09,342
How hard is it to paint a pretty girl?

437
01:01:11,714 --> 01:01:12,976
Can I have her?

438
01:01:45,314 --> 01:01:47,407
Griet, there's been talk of you.

439
01:01:50,352 --> 01:01:51,649
I've done nothing.

440
01:01:51,687 --> 01:01:56,215
Van Ruijven's cook says
you're to be painted with her master.

441
01:01:56,258 --> 01:02:00,627
You'll have heard about him and the maid
that was painted before?

442
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:06,996
- You shouldn't believe gossip.
- Oh, I don't.

443
01:02:08,504 --> 01:02:10,529
I'll tell Pieter you asked after him.

444
01:02:13,175 --> 01:02:14,142
Liver?

445
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:15,677
Griet.

446
01:02:15,711 --> 01:02:17,406
You've heard?

447
01:02:17,446 --> 01:02:18,572
I heard.

448
01:02:19,882 --> 01:02:22,043
No smoke without fire, they say.

449
01:02:25,387 --> 01:02:26,786
- Is that what you think?
- No.

450
01:02:28,824 --> 01:02:30,849
You're only a maid, what can you do?

451
01:02:32,495 --> 01:02:35,089
- I must get back.
- Don't walk away. Listen to me.

452
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:40,592
Just remember who you are.

453
01:02:42,772 --> 01:02:44,706
Don't get caught up in his world.

454
01:02:45,775 --> 01:02:47,504
I am only a maid,

455
01:02:47,543 --> 01:02:50,137
but I would never give in to Master Van Ruijven.

456
01:02:50,179 --> 01:02:51,976
I wasn't talking about Van Ruijven.

457
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:06,958
Ah, you girl, Griet.

458
01:03:06,996 --> 01:03:08,554
Come here.

459
01:03:08,597 --> 01:03:11,259
What were you doing today?
I missed you.

460
01:03:13,102 --> 01:03:14,091
We both did.

461
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:18,630
I hear you've been of great use
to your master, pretty Griet.

462
01:03:18,707 --> 01:03:21,904
All that grinding and stirring, eh?

463
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,541
Master and maid.

464
01:03:26,582 --> 01:03:29,050
It's a tune we all know.

465
01:03:30,619 --> 01:03:34,453
And you can practice together now
that we've made our bargain. Eh, Jan?

466
01:03:36,225 --> 01:03:37,988
You won't forget, will you?

467
01:03:39,662 --> 01:03:40,754
Good.

468
01:04:10,593 --> 01:04:12,720
- What should I...?
- No.

469
01:04:14,697 --> 01:04:18,098
No. I already... already begun
a group painting.

470
01:04:20,803 --> 01:04:23,829
You're not to sit with Master
Van Ruijven, that much is agreed.

471
01:04:26,508 --> 01:04:27,975
Thank you, sir.

472
01:04:31,013 --> 01:04:32,480
I'm to paint you alone.

473
01:04:50,232 --> 01:04:53,793
My daughter must not hear
of this other painting in her condition.

474
01:04:57,873 --> 01:05:00,740
It's to hang in his private cabinet.

475
01:05:02,878 --> 01:05:04,903
He's no fool, mind you.

476
01:05:04,947 --> 01:05:08,246
An he won't be taken for one,
so don't think otherwise.

477
01:05:11,053 --> 01:05:13,681
<i>You're a fly in his web.</i>

478
01:05:16,592 --> 01:05:18,685
<i>We all are.</i>

479
01:05:27,269 --> 01:05:30,238
You've to admit, my friend,
French swords are the best.

480
01:05:37,746 --> 01:05:38,713
Tomorrow morning.

481
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:42,917
I cannot, I have work.

482
01:05:42,952 --> 01:05:45,386
Find a way.

483
01:06:08,744 --> 01:06:10,712
The front of your cap, fold it back.

484
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:31,328
Take off your cap.

485
01:06:37,873 --> 01:06:39,306
No, sir.

486
01:06:39,341 --> 01:06:41,206
<i>I cannot.</i>

487
01:06:41,243 --> 01:06:43,973
Cannot?

488
01:06:44,013 --> 01:06:45,480
I will not.

489
01:06:46,515 --> 01:06:48,676
<i>I need to see
your face.</i>

490
01:06:48,717 --> 01:06:50,708
The cap covers too much.

491
01:06:59,661 --> 01:07:01,856
There's some cloth in the storeroom.

492
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:15,832
You know, I've a mind to go up there
one day and surprise him

493
01:08:15,904 --> 01:08:17,201
in the act.

494
01:08:20,576 --> 01:08:22,976
But you said yourself it's very dull.

495
01:08:23,011 --> 01:08:25,343
Oh, not with Emilie

496
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:28,611
when he's alone with some young beauty.

497
01:08:30,886 --> 01:08:33,650
Have you ever notice how
he never bothers with old women?

498
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:36,522
Only the young pretty ones.

499
01:08:36,558 --> 01:08:38,219
On their own.

500
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:40,023
You'll have to wait then.

501
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:44,526
He makes only one painting at a time.

502
01:08:45,567 --> 01:08:47,501
<i>Is that so?</i>

503
01:09:32,114 --> 01:09:33,240
<i>Jan?</i>

504
01:09:35,617 --> 01:09:38,450
Jan?
My necklace.

505
01:10:23,899 --> 01:10:26,094
Haven't you finished yet?

506
01:10:39,881 --> 01:10:41,610
I'll be in my studio until dinner.

507
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:56,959
Open your mouth.

508
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:02,263
Sir?

509
01:11:02,337 --> 01:11:04,032
Open your mouth.

510
01:11:08,577 --> 01:11:09,737
Less.

511
01:11:13,448 --> 01:11:15,643
Now lick your lips.

512
01:11:28,063 --> 01:11:29,428
Again.

513
01:11:48,183 --> 01:11:49,741
Again.

514
01:11:54,122 --> 01:11:55,885
Got you, got you, got you!

515
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:30,855
Wear these.

516
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:47,739
Good.

517
01:12:59,054 --> 01:13:00,248
Look, Griet.

518
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:04,620
Point of light in the shadow of the neck
leading the eye.

519
01:13:04,659 --> 01:13:05,648
Jan.

520
01:13:14,302 --> 01:13:15,667
Sir.

521
01:13:15,737 --> 01:13:18,797
- Do not ask this of me.
- It's needed.

522
01:13:18,874 --> 01:13:21,206
The composition, it's not balanced.

523
01:13:21,243 --> 01:13:23,177
I've seen you paint with no one there.

524
01:13:23,211 --> 01:13:25,475
You want me to imagine
how the earring would look?

525
01:13:25,514 --> 01:13:27,175
My ears are not pierced.

526
01:13:35,891 --> 01:13:38,189
She'll find out.

527
01:13:44,099 --> 01:13:45,828
This has to be, Griet.

528
01:13:48,136 --> 01:13:49,626
See for yourself.

529
01:14:07,389 --> 01:14:09,755
You looked inside me.

530
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:10,249
I've got you!

531
01:15:12,053 --> 01:15:14,749
Now hold still.
I want to look at you.

532
01:15:16,424 --> 01:15:17,652
Now, girl...

533
01:15:17,692 --> 01:15:21,184
tell me how you get on up there.

534
01:15:21,229 --> 01:15:23,595
Has he found his composition?

535
01:15:23,632 --> 01:15:26,658
Do you move him?
Do you inspire him?

536
01:15:26,701 --> 01:15:31,001
Tell me, has the master's brush
unlocked the secrets of your heart?

537
01:15:35,377 --> 01:15:38,369
Ripe as a plum...
still unplucked.

538
01:15:38,446 --> 01:15:40,243
What's he playing at?

539
01:15:41,249 --> 01:15:45,549
He made a bargain with me.
He's painting you at my pleasure.

540
01:15:51,026 --> 01:15:54,518
- No!
- I've waited long enough.

541
01:15:54,563 --> 01:15:57,191
What a great fool he is.

542
01:15:58,533 --> 01:16:00,262
Don't fight.

543
01:16:06,007 --> 01:16:07,133
No! No!

544
01:16:07,208 --> 01:16:09,005
<i>Griet?</i>

545
01:16:12,714 --> 01:16:15,205
Not a word.

546
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,377
You'll lose your place.

547
01:16:20,889 --> 01:16:22,686
He won't look at you again.

548
01:16:23,892 --> 01:16:25,257
<i>Griet!</i>

549
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:30,327
Ah, there you are, my dear.

550
01:16:30,365 --> 01:16:33,493
The maid kept me talking with some...

551
01:16:33,535 --> 01:16:35,435
cock and bull story.

552
01:17:16,211 --> 01:17:17,508
Well, girl?

553
01:17:19,681 --> 01:17:21,239
What's to be done?

554
01:17:22,717 --> 01:17:25,208
Master Van Ruijven wants his paintings...

555
01:17:25,253 --> 01:17:27,278
and he will bear no more delay.

556
01:17:29,057 --> 01:17:31,548
If he crosses Van Ruijven over this...

557
01:17:31,593 --> 01:17:33,686
he will lose him.

558
01:17:33,728 --> 01:17:35,889
Then what?

559
01:18:02,323 --> 01:18:03,915
My daughter is out for the day.

560
01:18:06,695 --> 01:18:08,629
Do it now.

561
01:18:57,979 --> 01:18:59,446
You do it.

562
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,417
Look at me.

563
01:20:47,455 --> 01:20:49,719
Now turn your head, not your shoulders.

564
01:20:52,026 --> 01:20:53,493
Look at me.

565
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:00,701
There, that's it.

566
01:22:09,904 --> 01:22:11,064
I'll see you later.

567
01:23:02,357 --> 01:23:04,154
Don't rush away, Griet, please.

568
01:23:07,328 --> 01:23:09,228
Leave the house.

569
01:23:09,263 --> 01:23:12,130
Join me and Paul in the meat market.

570
01:23:12,166 --> 01:23:13,895
- I must get back.
- I'll fetch your things,

571
01:23:13,935 --> 01:23:15,300
I'll send someone.

572
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:16,860
No.

573
01:23:16,938 --> 01:23:21,773
Our own life, Griet...
answering to no one.

574
01:23:23,544 --> 01:23:25,409
Marry me.

575
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:42,218
<i>Laughing at me
in my own house.</i>

576
01:24:42,256 --> 01:24:45,817
<i>I will see for myself.
No one will stop me.</i>

577
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:48,351
<i>There is nothing to see.
You're making yourself ridiculous.</i>

578
01:24:48,396 --> 01:24:49,488
<i>Calm, my dear.</i>

579
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:52,055
<i>I will not be calm!</i>

580
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,795
<i>Am I a child?!</i>

581
01:24:54,936 --> 01:24:57,166
Does no one speak the truth to me
in my own house?

582
01:24:57,238 --> 01:25:00,730
By all the saints, if you would stop
screaming for a moment, I can explain.

583
01:25:00,808 --> 01:25:01,934
More lies?!

584
01:25:02,009 --> 01:25:05,445
I don't want to hear
any more of your lies, Mother.

585
01:25:05,513 --> 01:25:07,981
I have a right to know.

586
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:18,081
So.

587
01:25:20,962 --> 01:25:22,691
No more hiding now.

588
01:25:22,730 --> 01:25:24,891
Here I am.

589
01:25:26,367 --> 01:25:28,767
I want to see this painting.

590
01:25:31,372 --> 01:25:33,169
There's no point.

591
01:25:33,241 --> 01:25:35,675
No point?!

592
01:25:37,478 --> 01:25:40,641
I am too stupid to look at a painting now?

593
01:25:43,918 --> 01:25:47,217
She can't read!
You know that?

594
01:25:47,255 --> 01:25:49,780
Sit down.
You'll exhaust yourself.

595
01:25:49,824 --> 01:25:50,882
Why can't I look?

596
01:25:50,925 --> 01:25:54,019
It's just a commission. Gone
in a few days. You need never see it.

597
01:25:57,565 --> 01:25:59,123
They are just paintings.

598
01:25:59,167 --> 01:26:02,694
Pictures, for money.
They mean nothing.

599
01:26:11,612 --> 01:26:14,410
Is it true she wore my pearls?

600
01:26:22,557 --> 01:26:24,582
How could you?

601
01:26:28,696 --> 01:26:30,288
How could you?

602
01:26:41,042 --> 01:26:42,907
Show me this painting.

603
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,809
You'll make yourself ill.

604
01:26:44,845 --> 01:26:46,745
You show me.

605
01:27:14,642 --> 01:27:16,610
It's obscene.

606
01:27:27,722 --> 01:27:29,849
Why don't you paint me?

607
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:31,482
Because you don't understand!

608
01:27:32,526 --> 01:27:34,585
And she does?

609
01:28:02,423 --> 01:28:05,790
No!
Get out of here!

610
01:28:10,865 --> 01:28:12,958
Get out of my house!

611
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:45,039
I've come to the right place, then.

612
01:31:45,079 --> 01:31:46,410
Tanneke?

613
01:31:51,018 --> 01:31:52,645
This is for you.
