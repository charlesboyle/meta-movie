just after they killed every Negro soldier

10

So at Jenkins' Ferry,

11
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,764
we decided warn't takin'
no Reb prisoners.

12
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,517
And we didn't leave a one of 'em alive.

13
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,186
The ones of us that didn't die that day,

14
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,064
we joined up with
the 1 1 6th U.S. Colored, sir,

I'm Corporal Ira Clark, sir.

20
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,453
We're waiting over there.

LINCOLN: How long
have you been a soldier?

25
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,550

26
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,969
LINCOLN: The Second Kansas
Colored Infantry,

27
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,388
they fought bravely at Jenkins' Ferry.

28
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:01,973
That's right, sir.

29
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,766
They killed
a thousand Rebel soldiers, sir.

30
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,685
They were very brave.

31
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,272
And making $3 less each month
than white soldiers.

32
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,606

33
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,985
Another $3 subtracted
from our pay for our uniforms.

34
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,528
That was true, yes sir,
but that's changed.

35
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,781
Equal pay now, but still
no commissioned Negro officers.

36
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,867
LINCOLN: I'm aware of that,
Corporal Clark.

37
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,952
Yes, sir.
That's good that you're aware, sir...

38
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,287
Do you think the Wilmington attack...

39
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,914
Now that white people
have accustomed themselves

40
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,749
to seeing Negro men with guns

41
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,001
fighting on their behalf,

42
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,419
and now that they can tolerate

43
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,754
Negro soldiers getting equal pay

44
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,382
maybe in a few years,
they can abide the idea

45
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,759
of Negro lieutenants and captains.

46
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,470
In fifty years, maybe a Negro colonel.

48
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,397
What will you do after the war,
Corporal Clark?

49
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,150
Work, sir.

50
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,028
-Hm.
-Perhaps you'll hire me.

51
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,654
Perhaps I will.

52
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,781
But you should know, sir,

53
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,992
that I get sick at the smell of boot black

54
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,994
and I cannot cut hair.

55
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,371
I've yet to find a man could cut mine

56
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,790
so that it'd make any difference.

00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,621
TAD: Why not?

181
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,997
LINCOLN: Willie's gone.

182
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,375
It's three years now he's gone.

(MUSIC STOPS)

185
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,491
The part assigned to me
is to raise the flag.

186
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:28,539
Which, if there be no fault
in the machinery, I will do.

187
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,375
And when up

188
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,837
it'll be for the people to keep it up.

189
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,428
That's my speech.

We are coming, Father Abraham

193
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,144
Three hundred thousand more

194
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,479
From Mississippi's winding stream

195
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,815
And from New England's shore

196
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,942
We leave our plow and workshops

Our wives...

198
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,239
Even if every Republican
in the House votes yes,

199
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,075
far from guaranteed.
Since when has our party

200
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,411
unanimously supported anything?

201
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,248
But say all our fellow Republicans
vote for it.

202
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,168
We'd still be twenty votes short.

203
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,335
Only twenty?

204
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,503
(LAUGHS) "Only twenty?"

205
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,838
We can find twenty votes.

206
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,799
Twenty House Democrats
who'll vote to abolish slavery?

207
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,009
In my opinion...

208
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,094
To which I always listen.

209
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,097
-Or pretend to.
-With all three of my ears.

210
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,100
We'll win the war soon.

211
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,227
It's inevitable, isn't it?

212
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,563
Well, it ain't won yet.

213
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,400
You'll begin your second term
with semi-divine stature.

214
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,278
Imagine the possibilities
peace will bring.

215
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,405
Why tarnish your invaluable luster

216
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,698
with a battle in the House?

217
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,492
It's a rat's nest in there.

218
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,161
It's the same gang of
talentless hicks and hacks

219
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,580
who rejected the amendment
1 0 months ago.

220
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,040
We'll lose.

221
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,002
I like our chances now.

222
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,340
Well, consider the obstacles
that we'd face.

223
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,218
The aforementioned two-thirds majority

224
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,969
needed to pass an amendment.

225
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:09,389
We have a Republican majority,
but barely more than 50%.

226
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,807
Fifty-six.

227
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,854
We need Democratic support.
There's none to be had.

228
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,773
Since the House
last voted on the amendment,

229
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,233
there's been an election.

230
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,692
Sixty-four Democrats

231
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,195
lost their House seats in November.

232
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,781
That's 64 Democrats
looking for work come March.

233
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,949
I know.

234
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,534
They don't need to
worry about re-election.

235
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,993
They can vote however it suits them.

236
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,330
But we can't buy the vote
for the amendment.

237

-It's too important.
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Jeff City?

250
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,410
I heard tell once
of a Jefferson City lawyer

251
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,288
who had a parrot

252
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,915
that'd wake him
each morning, crying out,

253
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,543
"Today is the day the world shall end,

254
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,712
"as scripture has foretold."

255
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,590
And, uh, one day

256
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,593
the lawyer shot him,

257
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,762
for the sake of peace and quiet,
I presume.

258
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,599

259
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,350

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,982
1 3th Amendment of the Constitution?

279
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,942
Yes, sir, everybody knows of it.

280
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,694
The President favors it.

281
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,321
-Do you?
-We do.

282
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,406
You know that it abolishes slavery?

283
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,658
Yes, sir, I know it.

284
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,951
And is that why you favor it?

285
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,330
What I favor is ending the war.

286
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,668
Once we do away with slavery,
the Rebs'll quit fighting

287
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,337
since slavery's what they're fighting for.

288
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,006
Mr. Lincoln, you always says so.

289
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,426
With the amendment, slavery's ended.

290
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,637
And they'll give up.
The war can finish then.

291
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,141
If the war finished first,
before we end slavery...

292
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,644
President Lincoln
says the war won't stop

293
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,729
unless we finish slavery.

294
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,856
But if it did.

295
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,858
The South is exhausted.

"Beanpole" Burton.

301
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,540

A Republican,

303
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,836
undecided on the question
of the amendment, I believe.

304
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,546
Perhaps you could call on him

305
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,548
and inform him of your enthusiasm.

306
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:30,966
Yeah.

00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,432

want Congressman Burton to vote

311
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,103
for the 1 3th Amendment?

312
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,859
If that was how it was,
no more war and all

313
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,236

much prefer not to have

314

00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,804
Ask Preston Blair
can I call on him around 5:00.

361
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,848
God help you.

362
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,893
God alone knows
what he'll ask you to give him.

363
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,354
If the Blairs tell them to,

364
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,857
no Republican will balk
at voting for the amendment.

365
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,526
No conservative Republican
is what you mean.

366
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,945
All Republicans
ought to be conservative.

367
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,405
I founded this party,

368
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,616
in my own goddamn home, to be a

369
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,035
conservative anti-slavery party,

370
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,329
not a hobbyhorse for
goddamn radical abolitionists.

371
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,205
Damp down the dyspepsia, Daddy.

372
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,082
You'll frighten the child.

373
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,126
You need us to keep
the conservative side

374
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,544
of the party in the traces

375
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:55,962
while you diddle the radicals

376
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,173
and bundle up
with Thaddeus Stevens's gang!

377
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,591
You need our help!

378
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,217
Yes, sir, I do.

379
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,886
Well, what do we get?

380
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,429
Whoa! Blunt!

381
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,724
Your manners, Monty,
must be why Mr. Lincoln

382
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,684
pushed you out of his Cabinet.

383
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,269
-I wasn't pushed!
-Oh, of course you weren't.

384
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,854
He was pushed out to
placate the damn radicals!

385
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:17,275
-I agreed to resign.
-Oh, Daddy, please! Daddy.

386
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,572
Oh. You don't mind, boy, do you?

387
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,741
He spends his days with soldiers.

388
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,825
They taught me a song.

389
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,369
Did they? (LAUGHS)

390
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,830
Soldiers know all manner of songs.

391
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,291
How's your brother Bob?

392
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,542
He's at school now, but he's coming

393
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,336
to visit in four days for the shindy.

394
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,546
At school. Ain't that fine?

395
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,423
Good he's not in the Army.

396
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,384
He wants to be,
but Mama said he cannot.

397
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,386
Dangerous life, soldiering.

398
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,389
Your mama is wise
to keep him clean out of that.

399
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,642
Now, your daddy knows that what I want

400
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,561
in return for all the help I can give him

401
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,439
is to go down to Richmond,
like he said I could

402
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,775
as soon as Savannah fell

403
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,319
and talk to Jefferson Davis.

404
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,280
Now give me terms
I can offer to Jefferson Davis

405
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,825
to start negotiating for peace.

406
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,076
He'll talk to me.

407
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,704
Conservative members of your party

408
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:14,416
want you to listen
to overtures from Richmond.

409
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,543
That above all!

410
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,505
They'll vote for this rash
and dangerous amendment

411
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,967
only if every other possibility
is exhausted.

412
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,095
Our Republicans ain't abolitionists.

413
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,682
We can't tell our people
they can vote yes

414
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,100
on abolishing slavery

415
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,228
unless at the same time we can tell them

416
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:38,231
that you're seeking a negotiated peace.

417
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,117
Leo, it's 1 00 miles to Richmond.

418
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,994
Get him drunk so he can sleep.

419
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,454
Yes, ma'am.

420
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,372
Here, Daddy.

421
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,874
Oh.

422
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,126
-Thank you.
-Yes, sir, all right.

423
00:22:58,711 --> 00:22:59,836
Where's my hat?

424
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,546
Leo has your hat.

425
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,964
All right?

426
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,925
Go make peace.

427
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,440
Thunder forth, God of War.

428
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,987
We'll commence our assault
on Wilmington from the sea.

429
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,992
Why is this burnt?

430
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,495
Was the boy playing with it?

431
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,830
It got took by a breeze
several nights back.

432
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,582
This is an official War Department map.

433
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,501
And the entire Cabinet's waiting

434
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,668
to hear what it portends.

435
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:41,836
WELLES: A bombardment.

436
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,256
From the largest fleet
the Navy has ever assembled.

437
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,759
Old Neptune, shake thy hoary locks!

438
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,844
Fifty-eight ships are under way,

439
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,263
of every tonnage and firing range.

440
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,682
STANTON: We'll keep up
a steady barrage.

441
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,476
Our first target is Fort Fisher.

442
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,228
It defends Wilmington Port.

443
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,271
SPEED: A steady barrage?

444
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,941
A hundred shells a minute.

445
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,068
Till they surrender.

446
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,153
-Dear God.
-(ALL MURMURING)

447
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,615
LINCOLN: Wilmington's
their last open seaport, therefore...

448
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,368
Wilmington falls, Richmond falls after.

449
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,122
And the war is done.

450
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:19,541
MEN: Hear, hear!

451
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,668
Then why, if I might ask

452
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,002
are we not concentrating

453
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,255
the nation's attention on Wilmington?

454
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,715
Why, instead, are we
reading in the Herald

455
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,759
that the anti-slavery amendment

456
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,887
is being precipitated onto
the House floor for debate?

457
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,055
Because your eagerness,

458
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,807
in what seems an unwarranted intrusion

459
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,476
of the executive into
legislative prerogatives,

460
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,395
is compelling it to what's...

461
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,481
To what's likely to be
its premature demise.

462
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:44,566
MEN: Hear, hear!

463
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,276
You signed
the Emancipation Proclamation.

464
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:47,360
You've done all that could be done.

465
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,653
The Emancipation Proclamation's

466
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,822
merely a war measure.
After the war, the courts...

467
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,657
When Edward Bates
was Attorney General,

468
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,950
he felt confident enough
to let you sign it!

469
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,077
Different lawyers, different opinions.

470
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,663
It frees slaves
as a military exigent. Not...

471
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:02,417
I don't recall Edward Bates
being any too certain about

472
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,253
the legality of my proclamation.

473
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,590
Just it wasn't downright criminal.

474
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,175
(ALL CHUCKLING)

475
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,427
Somewheres in between.

476
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:14,971
Mm.

477
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,808
Back when I rode
the legal circuit in Illinois,

478
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,227
I defended a woman from Metamora

479
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,104
named Melissa Goings.

480
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,940
Seventy-seven years old.

481
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,777
They said she'd murdered
her husband. He was 83.

482
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,322
He was choking her

483
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:36,159
and she grabbed a hold
of a stick of firewood

484
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,870
and fractured his skull and he died.

485
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,831
In his will, he wrote,

486
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:43,958
(CHUCKLES)

487
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,294
"I expect she has killed me."

488
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,713
(ALL LAUGHING)

489
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,675
"If I get over it, I will have revenge."

490
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,469
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)

491
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,058
No one was keen to see her convicted,

492
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,393
he was that kind of husband.

493
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,771
I asked the prosecuting attorney

494
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:08,066
if I might have a short conference
with my client.

495
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,402
She and I went into a room
in the courthouse,

496
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,363
but I alone emerged.

497
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,573
The window in the room
was found to be wide open.

498
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:19,244
It was believed the old lady
may have climbed out of it.

499
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,664
(CHUCKLING) I told the bailiff,

500
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,540
right before I left her in the room

501
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:25,708
she asked me where she could get

502
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,628
a good drink of water,
and I told her, Tennessee.

503
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,213
(MEN LAUGHING)

504
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,050
Mrs. Goings was seen no more
in Metamora.

505
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,344
Enough justice had been done.

506
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,430
They even forgave
the bondsman her bail.

507
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,849
USHER: I'm afraid I don't see...

508
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,393
I decided

509
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:47,689
that the Constitution
gives me war powers

510
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,149
but no one knows just exactly

511
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,277
what those powers are.

512
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,320
Some say they don't exist.

513
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,072
I don't know. I decided

514
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,408
I needed them to exist to uphold my oath

515
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,743
to protect the Constitution.

516
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,704
Which I decided meant I could take

517
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,664
the Rebels' slaves from them

518
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,125
as property confiscated in war.

519
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,836
That might recommend
to suspicion that I agree

520
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,087
with the Rebs that their slaves

521
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,297
are property in the first place.

522
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,632
Of course, I don't. Never have.

523
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,593
I'm glad to see any man free,

524
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,887
and if calling a man property

525
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,264
or war contraband

526
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,600
does the trick,
why I caught at the opportunity.

527
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,229
Now here's where it gets truly slippery.

528
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,357
I use the law allowing for the seizure

529
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:32,525
of property in a war

530
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,068
knowing it applies only to the property

531
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,821
of governments and citizens
of belligerent nations.

532
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,240
Well, the South ain't a nation.

533
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,993
That's why I can't negotiate with them.

534
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,912
So if, in fact, the Negroes are property,

535
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,289
according to the law,

536
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,291
have I the right to take
the Rebels' property

537
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,209
from them, if I insist they're rebels only

538
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:53,254
and not citizens of a belligerent country?

539
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,006
And slipperier still, I maintain it ain't

540
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,925
our actual Southern states in rebellion

541
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,762
but only the rebels living in those states,

542
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:04,182
the laws of which states remain in force.

543
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,311
"The laws of which states
remain in force."

544
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,521
That means that since it's
states' laws that determine

545
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,066
whether Negroes can be sold as slaves,

546
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,650
as property,

547
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,487
the federal government
doesn't have a say in that.

548
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,197
At least not yet.

549
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:23,034
Then Negroes in those states
are slaves,

550
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,118
hence property,

551
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,371
hence my war powers
allow me to confiscate them

552
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,706
as such, so I confiscate them.

553
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,958
But if I'm a respecter of states' laws,

554
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,418
how then can I legally free them

555
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,796
with my Proclamation as I done?

556
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,049
Unless I'm canceling states' laws?

557
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,139
I felt the war demanded it.

558
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,809
My oath demanded it.

559
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,520
I felt right with myself,

560
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,897
and I hoped it was legal to do it.

561
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,649
I'm hoping still.

562
00:28:56,402 --> 00:29:00,405
Two years ago, I proclaimed
these people emancipated.

563
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:04,826
"Then, thenceforward and forever free."

564
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,287
Now let's say the courts
decide I had no authority

565
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,998
to do it. They might well decide that.

566
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,126
Say there's no amendment
abolishing slavery,

567
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,669
say it's after the war

568
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,712
and I can no longer use my war powers

569
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,589
to just ignore the courts' decisions

570
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,134
like I sometimes felt I had to do.

571
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:24,762
Might those people I freed
be ordered back into slavery?

572
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,892
That's why I'd like to get

573
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,978
the 1 3th Amendment through the House,

574
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,188
on its way to ratification by the states.

575
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,982

precisely the sort of dictator

586
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,059

have been howling about.

aren't susceptible to law.

Twisting meanings?

591
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,986
Well, the people do that, I suppose.

592
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,698
I signed the Emancipation Proclamation,

593
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,784
what, a year and a half
before my second election?

594
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,661
I felt I was within my power to do it,

595
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:34,248
however, I also felt that
I might be wrong about that.

596
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,541
I knew the people would tell me.

597
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,293
I gave them a year and a half
to think about it,

598
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,711
and they re-elected me.

599
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,671
And come February the first,

600
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,591

Why, for instance, is this thus,

608
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,487
and what is the reason
for this thusness?

the anti-slavery amendment

You are the amendment's manager,
are you not?

I am, of course, but...

614
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,832
Then we're counting
on robust radical support

615
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,584

625
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,893

the easy work of 1 0 minutes.

650
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,121

to frighten the Rebels
into an immediate surrender.

00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,042

00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,725
Then despite our abstention,

896
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,393
to reach a two-thirds majority,

897
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,229
we remain twenty yeses short.

898
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,355
For which we're seeking

899
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,982
from among 64 lame duck Democrats.

900
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:53,654
Fully 39 of these we deem
unredeemable no votes.

901
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,991
The kind that hates niggers.

902
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,661
Hates God for makin' niggers.

903
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,747
The Good Lord on high
would despair of their souls.

904
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,959
Thank you for that
pithy explanation, Mr. Bilbo.

905
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,752
We've abandoned these 39 to

906
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,504
the devil that possesses them.

907
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,588
We would...

908
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:16,426
The remaining lame ducks, on whom
we've been working with a purpose.

909
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,428
Charles Hanson.

910
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,180
Congressman.

911
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,600
My colleagues and I would like
a moment of your time.

912
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:25,477
I wonder if you've given much thought...

913
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,354
Giles Stuart.

914
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,194
Rather clumsy.

915
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,292
LATHAM: Nelson Merrick.

916
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:55,882
Homer Benson.

917
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,557
My name is Richard Schell.

918
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,059
I wanted you to have a look
at this prospectus here.

919
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,062
And lastly,

920
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,150
Clay Hawkins. Of Ohio.

921
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,153
Tax Collector for the Western Reserve.

922
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,821
That pays handsomely.

923
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,656
Don't just reach
for the highest branches,

924
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,575
they sway in every breeze.

925
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,077
Assistant Port Inspector in Morristown

926
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,662
looks like the ticket to me.

927
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,581
Boats, they, they make me sick.

928
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,708
So just stand on the dock.

929
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,586
Let the Assistant Assistant
Port Inspector's stomach

930
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,004
go weak.

931
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,924
SEWARD: And, lastly,
Democratic yes vote

932
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,926
number six, Hawkins.

933
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,011
From Ohio.

934
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,179
Six?

935
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,847
Well, thus far.

936
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,058
Plus Graylor's abstention.

937
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,935
-From tiny acorns and so on.
-What did Hawkins get?

938
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:51,188
Postmaster of the Millersburg
Post Office.

939
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,606
He's selling himself cheap, ain't he?

940
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,941
Well, he wanted Tax Collector
of the Western Reserve.

941
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,110
First term Congressman
who couldn't manage reelection.

942
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,278
I felt it unseemly

943
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,863
and they bargained him down
to Postmaster.

944
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,365
Scatter them over several
rounds of appointments

945
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:02,866
so no one notices, then burn this ledger,

946
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,035

948
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,792
Might as well let them in.

949
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,921
Seven yeses with Mr. Ellis.

950
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,465
Thirteen to go.

951
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:21,134
One last item.

952
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,428
An absurdity, but

953
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,807
my associates report that
among the Representatives

954
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,476
a fantastical rumor's bruited about,

955
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,437
which I immediately disavowed,

956
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,898
that you'd allowed
bleary old Preston Blair

957
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,066
to sojourn to Richmond

958
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,235
to invite Jeff Davis
to send commissioners

959
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,904
up to Washington with a peace plan.

960
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:47,244
I, of course, told them
that you would never.

961
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:50,163
Not without consulting me, you wouldn't.

962
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,166
Because why on earth would you?

963
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,254
Much obliged.

964
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,346
SEWARD: Why wasn't I consulted?

965
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,931
I'm Secretary of State.

966
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,601
And you informally send
a reactionary dotard to...

967
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:37,437
What will happen, do you imagine,

968
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:40,106
when these
peace commissioners arrive?

969
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:41,274
We'll hear them out.

970
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,026
Oh. Splendid.

971
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,694
And next, the Democrats will invite them

972
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,279
up to hearings on the Hill.

973
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,949
And the newspapers...
Oh, the newspapers.

974
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:50,450
The newspapers will ask,

975
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,369
"Why risk enraging the Confederacy

976
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:53,453
"over the issue of slavery

977
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:55,914

980
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,296

all our preparing the ground for the vote

982
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,967
laid waste for naught.

983
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,802
The Blairs promised support
for the amendment

984
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,886
if we listen to these people.

985
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,805
Oh, the Blairs promise, do they?

986
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:12,973
You think they'll keep their promise

987
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,140
once we've heard these delegates

988
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:16,142
and refused them,
which we will have to do,

989
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,727
since their proposal most certainly

990
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,145
will be predicated on

991
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,814
keeping their slaves!

992
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,441

any Democratic votes, Willum,

00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,735

I've refused a chance

to end the war?

995
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,739
You think word won't get out?

996
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,242
In Washington?

997
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:35,996
It's either the amendment
or this Confederate peace.

You cannot have both.

Yes, I suppose it is.

00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,015
Actually, I have no idea
what you mean by that.

1006

the war was going so badly.

1072
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:35,401
We had to put on a face.

1073
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:36,986
(VOICE BREAKING)
But I saw Willie was dying.

1074
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,655
Molly...

1075
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,490
(SOBBING) I saw him.

1076
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,410
It's too hard.

1077
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,082
(KISSES)

1078
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,751
Too hard.

-(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

1080
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,177
Oh, gracious saints!

(INDISTINCT)

1082
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,776
She's just ten feet yonder.
I'd like to keep my job.

1083
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,194
-How nice to see you.
-Nice to see you.

1084
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,781
Senator Sumner.
It's been much too long.

1085
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,533
"Oh, who can look
on that celestial face..."

1086
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,617
And?

1087
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,202
James Ashley, ma'am.
We've met several times.

1088
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,954
Praise heavens, praise heavens.

1089
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,290
Just when I had abandoned
hope of amusement,

1090
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,624
it's the Chairman of the House Ways

1091
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,626
-and Means Committee.
-Mrs. Lincoln.

1092
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:36,379
Madame President, if you please.

1093
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,464
(LAUGHS)

1094
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:40,216
Don't convene another subcommittee

1095
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:41,384
to investigate me, sir.

1096
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,303
I'm teasing. Smile, Senator Wade.

1097
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,305
I believe I am smiling, Mrs. Lincoln.

1098
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,556
As long as your household accounts

1099
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,474
are in order, madam,

1100
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,894
we'll have no need to investigate them.

1101
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,897
You have always taken such a lively,

1102
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:57,817
even prosecutorial interest
in my household accounts.

1103
00:53:57,902 --> 00:54:00,570
Your household accounts have
always been so interesting.

1104
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,655
Yes, thank you. It's true.

1105
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,658
The miracles I have wrought

1106
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:08,244
out of fertilizer bills and cutlery invoices,

1107
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:09,954
but I had to.

1108
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,166
Four years ago, when
the President and I arrived,

1109
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,751
this was pure pigsty.

1110
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,753
Tobacco stains on the Turkey carpets.

1111
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:20,423
Mushrooms, green as the moon,
sprouting from the ceilings.

1112
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,760
And a pauper's pittance
allotted for improvements.

1113
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,846
As if your committee joined
with all of Washington

1114
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,431
awaiting in what you anticipated

1115
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,975
would be our comfort in squalor.

1116
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,770
Further proof that my husband and I

1117
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:35,521
were prairie primitives

1118
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:38,691
unsuited to the position to
which an error of the people,

1119
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:42,278
a flaw in the Democratic
process had elevated us.

1120
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:45,281
The past is the past. It's a new year now

1121
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:49,535
and we are all getting along,
or so they tell me.

1122
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,788
I gather we are working together.

1123
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,873
The White House and the other House,

1124
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:55,208
hatching little plans together.

1125
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:56,376
-ROBERT: Mother.
-What?

1126
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,544
-You're creating a bottleneck.
-Oh.

1127
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:00,505
Oh, I'm detaining you.

1128
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:04,050
And more importantly,
the people behind you.

1129
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,470
How the people love my husband.

1130
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:12,058
They flock to see him by
their thousands on public days.

1131
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,561
They will never love you
the way they love him.

1132
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:19,816
How difficult it must be
for you to know that

1133
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,568
and yet how important to remember it.

1134
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,999
Since we have the floor
next in the debate,

1135
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,418
I thought I'd suggest you might

1136
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,004
temper your contribution

1137
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:44,090
so as not to frighten
our conservative friends.

1138
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,259
Ashley insists you're ensuring approval

1139
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,261
by dispensing patronage

1140
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,014
to otherwise undeserving Democrats.

1141
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,932
I can't ensure a single damn thing

1142
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,684
if you scare the whole House silly

1143
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,519
with talk of land appropriations

1144
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,521
and revolutionary tribunals.

1145
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,024
When the war ends, I intend to

1146
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:05,903
push for full equality,
the Negro vote, and much more.

1147
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,322
Congress shall mandate the seizure

1148
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:09,949
of every foot of Rebel land

1149
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,618
and every dollar of their property.

1150
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:15,496
We'll use their confiscated wealth

1151
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,540
to establish hundreds of thousands

1152
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,167
of free Negro farmers

1153
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,919
and, at their side,
soldiers armed to occupy

1154
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,629
and transform the heritage of traitors.

1155
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,716
We'll build up a land down there

1156
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,969
of free men and free women
and free children and freedom.

1157
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,807
The nation needs to know
that we have such plans.

1158
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,519
That's the untempered version
of reconstruction.

1159
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,315
(CHUCKLING) It is not...

1160
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,984
It's not quite exactly what I intend.

1161
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:50,698
But we shall oppose one another
in the course of time.

1162
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,867
Now we're working together,
and I'm asking you...

1163
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,202
For patience, I expect.

1164
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,037
When the people disagree,
bringing them together

1165
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,664
requires going slow
until they're ready to...

1166
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:00,833
Shit on the people and what they want

1167
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:01,918
and what they're ready for.

1168
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:03,211
I don't give a goddamn about the people

1169
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,545
and what they want.

1170
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:05,797
This is the face of someone

1171
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:07,256
who has fought long and hard

1172
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:08,466
for the good of the people

1173
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,219
without caring much for any of them.

1174
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,054
And I look a lot worse without my wig.

1175
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:17,850
The people elected me
to represent them,

1176
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,645
to lead them, and I lead.
You ought to try it.

1177
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,484
I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens

1178
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:30,363
and I have tried to profit
from the example of it, but

1179
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,406
if I'd listened to you,

1180
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:33,866
I'd have declared every slave free

1181
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,494
the minute the first shell
struck Fort Sumter.

1182
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,121
And the border states
would have gone over

1183
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,373
to the Confederacy,
the war would have been lost

1184
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:41,874
and the Union along with it,

1185
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,918
and instead of abolishing slavery

1186
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,711
as we hope to do in two weeks,

1187
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:48,381
we'd be watching,
helpless as infants, as it spread

1188
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,591
from the American South
into South America.

1189
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,511
Oh, how you have longed
to say that to me.

1190
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,097
You claim you trust them,

1191
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,558
but you know what the people are.

1192
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,145
You know that the inner compass,

1193
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,730
that should direct the soul
towards justice

1194
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:08,442
has ossified in white men
and women, North and South,

1195
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:10,319
unto utter uselessness,

1196
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,613
through tolerating the evil of slavery.

1197
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,782
White people cannot bear the thought

1198
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,742
of sharing this country's
infinite abundance

1199
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:18,411
with Negroes.

1200
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,749
A compass, I learned
when I was surveying,

1201
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:27,587
it'll point you true north
from where you're standing.

1202
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:29,505
But it's got no advice about

1203
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,216
the swamps and deserts and chasms

1204
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:34,844
that you'll encounter along the way.

1205
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,345
If in pursuit of your destination,

1206
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,347
you plunge ahead,
heedless of obstacles

1207
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:41,893
and achieve nothing more
than to sink in a swamp,

1208
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,646
what's the use of knowing true north?

1209
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:05,291
Robert's going to plead
with us to let him enlist.

1210
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:11,964
Make time to talk to Robbie.
You only have time for Tad.

1211
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:13,507
Tad is young.

1212
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:17,720
So is Robert. Too young for the Army.

1213
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,806
Plenty of boys younger
than Robert signing up.

1214
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,478
Don't take Robbie.

1215
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:27,939
Don't let me lose my son.

Go away! We're occupied!

1218
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,948
Secretary Stanton has sent over

1219
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,491
to tell you that as of half an hour ago

1220
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,993
the shelling of Wilmington Harbor
has commenced.

1221
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,706
(DOOR CLOSING)

1222
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,876
They cannot possibly maintain
under this kind of an assault.

1223
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,462
Terry has got 1 0,000 men
surrounding the goddamn port.

1224
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,546
Why doesn't he answer...

1225
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:54,590
Fort Fisher is a mountain
of a building, Edwin.

1226
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:55,758
It's the largest fort they have, sir.

1227
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,718
Twenty-two big Seacoast guns
on each rampart.

1228
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,095
They've been reinforcing it
for the last two years.

1229
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,264
They've taken 1 7,000 shells
since yesterday!

1230
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,975
I want to hear Fort Fisher is ours

1231
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,268
and Wilmington has fallen.

1232
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:06,852
Send another damn cable!

1233
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:09,563
The problem's their
commander, Whiting!

1234
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,774
He engineered the fortress himself,

1235
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:12,900
the damn thing's his child.

1236
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,361
He'll defend it till
his every last man is gone.

(CHUCKLES) That's
what Ethan Allen called out

1239
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:27,581
to the commander
of Fort Ticonderoga in 1 776.

"Come on out, you old rat!"

1241
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,086
(SIGHS) Of course, there were only

1242
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,588
40 odd Redcoats at Ticonderoga.

1243
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:39,510

"Things which are equal

Your frantic attempt to delude us now

1598

is unworthy of a representative.

1599

01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:30,317
And bear what we must.
Hold and carry what we must.

1764
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:34,071
What I carry within me,
you must allow me to do it.

1765
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:37,074
Alone, as I must. And you alone, Mary,

1766
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:40,744
you alone may lighten this burden.

1767
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:43,914
Or render it intolerable.

1768
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:45,916
As you choose.

(SINGING OPERA)

1770
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:09,690
You think I'm ignorant
of what you're up to

1771
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:10,858
because you haven't discussed

1772
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:13,277
this scheme with me
as you ought to have done?

1773
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:16,197
When have I ever been
so easily bamboozled?

1774
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:17,865
I believe you when you insist

1775
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,450
that amending the Constitution

1776
01:32:19,576 --> 01:32:21,535
and abolishing slavery will end this war.

1777
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:23,954
And since you are
sending my son into the war,

1778
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,124
woe unto you if you fail
to pass the amendment.

1779
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:33,297
Seward doesn't want me
leaving big muddy footprints

1780
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:34,924
all over town.

1781
01:32:38,637 --> 01:32:40,721
(SOFTLY) No one has ever lived
who knows better than you

1782
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:42,890
the proper placement of footfalls

1783
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:44,892
on treacherous paths.

1784
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:47,728
Seward can't do it. You must.

1785
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:52,149
Because if you fail to acquire
the necessary votes,

1786
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:55,110
woe unto you, sir. You will answer to me.

1787
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:10,793
Thank you.

1788
01:33:16,967 --> 01:33:19,802
I know the vote is only four days away.

1789
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:22,096
I know you're concerned.

1790
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:24,265
Thank you for your concern over this.

1791
01:33:25,183 --> 01:33:27,977
And I want you to know,
they'll approve it.

1792
01:33:29,312 --> 01:33:31,021
God will see to it.

1793
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:34,858
I don't envy Him his task.

1794
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:39,029
He may wish He'd chosen
an instrument for His purpose

1795
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:42,157
more wieldy than
the House of Representatives.

1796
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:45,202
Then you'll see to it.

1797
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:50,791
Are you afraid of what
lies ahead for your people

1798
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,376
if we succeed?

1799
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:56,171
White people don't want us here.

1800
01:33:56,548 --> 01:33:58,966
-Many don't.
-What about you?

1801
01:34:04,389 --> 01:34:06,682
I don't know you, Mrs. Keckley.

1802
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:09,059
Any of you.

1803
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:13,522
You're familiar to me, as all people are,

1804
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:17,818
unaccommodated, poor, bare,
forked creatures,

1805
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:19,570
such as we all are.

1806
01:34:20,864 --> 01:34:23,574
You have a right to expect what I expect.

1807
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:26,076
And likely our expectations

1808
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:28,662
are not incomprehensible to each other.

1809
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:34,501
I assume I'll get used to you.

1810
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,588
Now what you are to the nation,

1811
01:34:38,757 --> 01:34:41,258
what'll become of you
once slavery's day is done,

1812
01:34:41,593 --> 01:34:43,385
I don't know.

1813
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:47,598
What my people are to be, I can't say.

1814
01:34:49,768 --> 01:34:52,853
Negroes have been fighting
and dying for freedom

1815
01:34:53,438 --> 01:34:55,939
since the first of us was a slave.

1816
01:34:56,024 --> 01:34:59,526
I never heard any ask
what freedom would bring.

1817
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:03,280
Freedom is first.

1818
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:07,534
As for me,

1819
01:35:08,953 --> 01:35:11,622
my son died fighting for the Union,

1820
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:14,875
wearing the Union blue.

1821
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:17,211
For freedom he died.

1822
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:21,006
And I'm his mother.

1823
01:35:23,218 --> 01:35:26,136
That's what I am
to the nation, Mr. Lincoln.

1824
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:32,226
What else must I be?

1825
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:43,570
My whole hand's gonna be proud
in about five seconds.

1826
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:45,239
Let's see how proud you can be.

01:35:46,408 --> 01:35:48,992
Go away. That watch fob, is that gold?

1829

You keep your eyes off my fob.

I wouldn't bet against it.

1836
01:36:02,507 --> 01:36:03,924
W. N. Bilbo.

1837
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:06,093
Yeah, Mr. Bilbo. Gentlemen.

1838
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:07,177
Sir.

1839
01:36:07,554 --> 01:36:09,054
Why are you here? No offense,

1840
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:12,474
but Mr. Seward's banished
the very mention of your name.

1841
01:36:12,559 --> 01:36:14,226
He won't even let us use fifty cent pieces

1842
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:16,186
'cause they've got your face on 'em.

1843
01:36:16,938 --> 01:36:19,523
The Secretary of State here
tells me that you got

1844
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:22,067
1 1 Democrats in the bag.
That's encouraging.

1845
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:25,904
Oh, you've got no cause
to be encouraged, sir.

1846

I'm here to alert you boys

1849

that the great day of reckoning
is nigh upon us.

The Democrats we've yet to bag, sir,

1851

the patronage jobs simply won't bag 'em.

1852
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:48,093
They require more convincing,
Mr. President.

1853

Mm-hmm. Do me a favor, will you?

1854
01:36:52,724 --> 01:36:53,765
Sure.

1855
01:36:53,892 --> 01:36:55,893

in the paper this morning

1856
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:57,394
that the Governor Curtin

1857
01:36:57,479 --> 01:36:59,813

-That's him.

-He's a Democrat.
-I understand that.

-Silly name.
-LINCOLN: A little bit silly.

01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:26,215
Uh, tell Governor Curtin
it'd be much appreciated

1871
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:28,926
if he'd invite
the House of Representatives

1872
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:30,052
to decide who won.

1873
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:32,763
He's entitled to do that. He'll agree to it.

1874
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:35,140
Then advise Coffroth

1875
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:37,601
if he hopes to retain his seat,

1876
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:39,978
then he'd better pay a visit
to Thaddeus Stevens.

to which you've attached
yourself like a barnacle

1891
01:38:18,184 --> 01:38:21,478
has the effrontery to call
itself the Democratic Party.

1892
01:38:21,563 --> 01:38:24,523
You are a Democrat.
What's the matter with you?

a Republican.

No, sir, I was not trounced.

now controls the House

and hence the House
Committee on Elections,

1912
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:14,156
so you have been beaten.

You shall shortly be sent home
in disgrace. Unless...

has bipartisan support,

you idiot. Early in the next Congress,

1923
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:36,386
when I tell you to do so,
you will switch parties.

on your victory, and get out.

Kentucky.

1935
01:40:01,663 --> 01:40:04,706
I can't vote for
the amendment, Mr. Lincoln.

1936
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:14,424
I saw a barge once, Mr. Yeaman,

1937
01:40:15,093 --> 01:40:17,427
filled with colored men in chains

1938
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:18,762
heading down the Mississippi

1939
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:20,764
to the New Orleans slave markets.

1940
01:40:22,225 --> 01:40:23,433
It sickened me.

1941
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:27,229
And more than that,
it brought a shadow down.

1942
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:31,108
A pall around my eyes.

1943
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:35,445
Slavery troubled me
as long as I can remember

1944
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,490
in a way it never troubled my father,

1945
01:40:39,492 --> 01:40:41,785
though he hated it, in his own fashion.

1946
01:40:43,246 --> 01:40:45,163
He knew no smallholding dirt farmer

1947
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:46,957
could compete with slave plantations

1948
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:49,334
so he took us out from Kentucky

1949
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:50,669
to get away from 'em.

1950
01:40:50,795 --> 01:40:52,587
He wanted Indiana kept free.

1951
01:40:54,132 --> 01:40:55,799
He wasn't a kind man

1952
01:40:57,427 --> 01:41:00,846
but there was a rough,
moral urge for fairness,

1953
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:02,305
for freedom in him.

1954
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:05,308
I learnt that from him, I suppose.

1955
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:07,519
If little else from him.

1956
01:41:10,148 --> 01:41:12,357
We didn't care
for one another, Mr. Yeaman.

1957
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:17,571
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1958
01:41:17,655 --> 01:41:20,741
Loving kindness, that most
ordinary thing, came to me

1959
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:22,993
from other sources. I'm grateful for that.

1960
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:25,954

1962
01:41:29,709 --> 01:41:32,627
But we're entirely unready
for emancipation.

1963
01:41:33,171 --> 01:41:34,296
And there's too many questions...

1964
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:35,714

1966
01:41:36,966 --> 01:41:39,176
Yeah, when it comes,
it'll present us with conundrums

1967
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:42,596
and dangers greater than
any we faced during the war,

1968
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,431

1969
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:48,393
We'll have to extemporize and
experiment with what it is,

1970
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:49,644
when it is.

1971
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,691
I read your speech, George.

1972

1973
01:41:58,404 --> 01:41:59,529
that's a puzzle.

1974
01:42:00,406 --> 01:42:04,034
No, no. But, but, but Negroes can't

1975
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:07,913
uh, vote, Mr. Lincoln.

1976
01:42:09,165 --> 01:42:10,832
You're not suggesting
we enfranchise colored people?

1977
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,626
I'm asking only that

1978
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:16,546
you disenthrall yourself
from the slave powers.

1979
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:19,174
I'll let you know when

1980
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:20,884
there's an offer on my desk
for surrender.

And it's going to be so very close.

1985

You see what you can do.

1986
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:45,867
I can't make sense of it.

1987
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:48,370
What he died for.

1988
01:42:50,957 --> 01:42:53,250

I might be wrong, Mr. Hutton,

1996

but I expect colored people
most likely be free.

1997

1999

02:01:58,353 --> 02:02:00,354
Shouting the battle cry of freedom

2290
02:02:01,773 --> 02:02:04,233
We will rally from the hillside

2291
02:02:04,317 --> 02:02:06,235
We'll gather from the plain

2292
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:09,905
Shouting the battle cry of freedom

2293
02:02:10,281 --> 02:02:14,535
The Union forever!
Hurrah, boys, hurrah!

2294
02:02:14,619 --> 02:02:16,453
Down with the traitor

2295
02:02:16,538 --> 02:02:18,247
And up with the star

2296
02:02:18,456 --> 02:02:22,376
Shout, shout the battle cry of Freedom!

2297
02:02:22,669 --> 02:02:24,294
Congratulations, Mr. Chairman.

2298
02:02:24,379 --> 02:02:26,463
The bill, Mr. McPherson. May I?

2299
02:02:26,589 --> 02:02:28,215
(SINGING CONTINUES)

2300
02:02:28,925 --> 02:02:32,428
The Union forever!
Hurrah, boys, hurrah!

2301
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:35,305
That's, that's the official bill.

2302
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:37,433
I'll return it in the morning.

2303
02:02:38,018 --> 02:02:39,393
Creased,

2304
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:41,270
but unharmed.

2305
02:02:41,354 --> 02:02:45,024
Shouting the battle cry of freedom

2306
02:02:45,108 --> 02:02:49,403
We are springing to the call
Of the loyal, true and brave

2307
02:02:49,571 --> 02:02:50,863
Shouting the battle cry of freedom

2308
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:53,032
-(PEOPLE CHEERING)
-(BAND PLAYING)

2309
02:02:53,158 --> 02:02:55,325
And we'll fill our vacant ranks

2310
02:02:55,410 --> 02:02:57,327
With a million freemen more

2311
02:02:58,204 --> 02:03:00,956
Shouting the battle cry of freedom

2312
02:03:02,125 --> 02:03:03,667
The Union forever!

2313
02:03:04,502 --> 02:03:06,003
Hurrah, boys, hurrah!

2314
02:03:06,588 --> 02:03:10,007
Down with the traitor
And up with the star

2315
02:03:31,946 --> 02:03:34,073
A gift for you.

2316
02:03:38,411 --> 02:03:40,496
The greatest measure
of the 1 9th century,

2317
02:03:40,580 --> 02:03:41,663
passed by corruption,

2318
02:03:41,748 --> 02:03:45,000
aided and abetted by
the purest man in America.

2319
02:04:03,645 --> 02:04:05,562
I wish you had been present.

2320
02:04:06,356 --> 02:04:08,440
-I wish I'd been.
-It was a spectacle.

2321
02:04:09,317 --> 02:04:11,777
You can't bring your
housekeeper to the House.

2322
02:04:11,861 --> 02:04:13,862
I won't give them gossip.

2323
02:04:13,947 --> 02:04:15,489
This is enough.

2324
02:04:15,865 --> 02:04:16,990
This is...

2325
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:20,452
It's more than enough for now.

2326
02:04:22,038 --> 02:04:23,747
Read it to me again, my love.

2327
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:27,626
-"Proposed..."
-And adopted.

2328
02:04:27,710 --> 02:04:29,086
"Adopted,

2329
02:04:29,754 --> 02:04:30,879

(SHIP HORN BLOWING)

2342
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:25,058
Let me be blunt.

2343
02:05:25,768 --> 02:05:27,436
Will the Southern states

2344
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:30,063
resume their former position
in the Union

2345
02:05:30,148 --> 02:05:31,648
speedily enough to enable us

2346
02:05:31,733 --> 02:05:34,318
to block ratification to this here

2347
02:05:34,402 --> 02:05:35,569
1 3th Amendment?

2348
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:41,742
I'd like peace immediately.

2349
02:05:42,702 --> 02:05:44,119
Yes, and?

2350
02:05:46,998 --> 02:05:49,583
I'd like your states restored to

2351
02:05:49,667 --> 02:05:53,253
their practical relations
with the Union immediately.

2352
02:05:56,007 --> 02:05:58,091
If this could be given to me in writing,

2353
02:05:58,635 --> 02:06:00,552
as Vice President of the Confederacy,

2354
02:06:00,637 --> 02:06:01,970
I'd bring that document

2355
02:06:02,055 --> 02:06:03,889
with celerity, to Jefferson Davis.

2356
02:06:06,559 --> 02:06:07,684
Surrender.

2357
02:06:08,186 --> 02:06:10,520
And we can discuss reconstruction.

2358
02:06:12,357 --> 02:06:13,941
Surrender won't be thought of.

2359
02:06:14,734 --> 02:06:17,903
Unless you've assured us, in writing,

2360
02:06:17,987 --> 02:06:20,697
that we'll be readmitted
in time to block this amendment.

2361
02:06:21,282 --> 02:06:24,826
This is the arrogant demand
of a conqueror.

2362
02:06:25,036 --> 02:06:27,913
You'll not be
a conquered people, Mr. Hunter.

2363
02:06:27,997 --> 02:06:29,456
You will be citizens.

2364
02:06:30,625 --> 02:06:32,209
Returned to the laws and
the guarantees of rights

2365
02:06:32,293 --> 02:06:33,293
of the Constitution.

2366
02:06:34,212 --> 02:06:36,880
Which now extinguishes slavery.

2367
02:06:36,965 --> 02:06:39,716
And with it, our economy.

2368
02:06:40,051 --> 02:06:41,385
All our laws will be determined by

2369
02:06:41,469 --> 02:06:43,095
a Congress of vengeful Yankees.

2370
02:06:43,888 --> 02:06:46,431
All our rights will be subject
to a Supreme Court

2371
02:06:47,141 --> 02:06:49,142
benched by bloody Republican radicals.

2372
02:06:49,811 --> 02:06:52,729
All our traditions will be obliterated.

2373
02:06:53,690 --> 02:06:55,440
We won't know ourselves anymore.

2374
02:06:57,485 --> 02:06:59,903
We ain't here to discuss reconstruction.

2375
02:06:59,988 --> 02:07:02,364
We have no legal basis
for that discussion.

2376
02:07:02,448 --> 02:07:04,074
But I don't want to deal falsely.

2377
02:07:04,158 --> 02:07:06,702
The Northern states
will ratify, most of them.

2378
02:07:06,786 --> 02:07:08,578
As I figure it, it remains for
two of the Southern states

2379
02:07:08,663 --> 02:07:09,705
to do the same,

2380
02:07:09,789 --> 02:07:11,456
even after all are readmitted.

2381
02:07:11,541 --> 02:07:13,125
And I've been working on that.

2382
02:07:14,085 --> 02:07:15,210
Tennessee and Louisiana.

2383
02:07:15,628 --> 02:07:17,838
Arkansas, too, most likely.
It'll be ratified.

2384
02:07:18,548 --> 02:07:21,300
Slavery, sir... It's done.

2385
02:07:34,772 --> 02:07:37,524
If we submit ourselves to law, Alex,

2386
02:07:38,276 --> 02:07:40,277
even submit to losing freedoms,

2387
02:07:41,696 --> 02:07:43,864
the freedom to oppress, for instance

2388
02:07:44,991 --> 02:07:46,783
we may discover other freedoms

2389
02:07:46,909 --> 02:07:48,410
previously unknown to us.

2390
02:07:49,495 --> 02:07:53,040
Had you kept faith
with the democratic process,

2391
02:07:53,124 --> 02:07:54,583
as frustrating as that can be...

2392
02:07:54,667 --> 02:07:55,917
Come, sir.

2393
02:07:56,044 --> 02:07:58,545
Spare us, at least, these pieties.

2394
02:07:59,505 --> 02:08:01,089
Did you defeat us with ballots?

2395
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:04,384
How have you held your Union together?

2396
02:08:05,386 --> 02:08:06,595
Through democracy?

2397
02:08:07,847 --> 02:08:09,598
How many hundreds
of thousands have died

2398
02:08:09,682 --> 02:08:11,099
during your administration?

2399
02:08:12,518 --> 02:08:15,145
Your Union, sir, is bonded
in cannon fire and death.

2400
02:08:18,941 --> 02:08:20,359
It may be you're right.

2401
02:08:24,781 --> 02:08:27,616
But say all we done is show the world

2402
02:08:27,700 --> 02:08:29,868
that democracy isn't chaos.

2403
02:08:32,538 --> 02:08:35,999
That there is a great, invisible strength

2404
02:08:36,084 --> 02:08:37,459
in a people's union.

2405
02:08:38,378 --> 02:08:42,255
Say we've shown that a people
can endure awful sacrifice

2406
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:44,007
and yet cohere.

2407
02:08:44,634 --> 02:08:45,801
Mightn't that save at least

2408
02:08:45,885 --> 02:08:48,136
the idea of democracy to aspire to?

2409
02:08:49,597 --> 02:08:51,890
Eventually to become worthy of?

2410
02:08:56,062 --> 02:08:57,979
At all rates, whatever may be proven

2411
02:08:58,064 --> 02:09:00,273
by blood and sacrifice

2412
02:09:00,358 --> 02:09:01,900
must have been proved by now.

2413
02:09:12,286 --> 02:09:14,413
Shall we stop this bleeding?

2414
02:09:17,375 --> 02:09:19,960
(RUMBLING)

2415
02:10:53,054 --> 02:10:54,054
Once he surrenders,

2416
02:10:54,138 --> 02:10:55,931
send his boys back to their homes

2417
02:10:56,766 --> 02:10:58,391
and their farms, their shops.

2418
02:11:00,311 --> 02:11:01,436
Yes, sir.

2419
02:11:02,772 --> 02:11:03,772
As we discussed.

2420
02:11:03,856 --> 02:11:06,066
Liberality all around, not punishment.

2421
02:11:06,150 --> 02:11:07,234
I don't want that.

2422
02:11:08,110 --> 02:11:10,987
And their leaders,
Jeff and the rest of them,

2423
02:11:11,072 --> 02:11:12,364
they escape, leave the country

2424
02:11:12,448 --> 02:11:14,950
while my back's turned,
that wouldn't upset me none.

2425
02:11:16,285 --> 02:11:18,995
When peace comes,
it mustn't just be hangings.

2426
02:11:25,461 --> 02:11:27,003
By outward appearance

2427
02:11:28,756 --> 02:11:31,550
you're 1 0 years older
than you were a year ago.

2428
02:11:32,093 --> 02:11:33,218
Hmm.

2429
02:11:34,887 --> 02:11:37,138
Some weariness has bit at my bones.

2430
02:11:50,611 --> 02:11:52,904
I never seen the like of it before,

2431
02:11:52,989 --> 02:11:54,489
what I seen today.

2432
02:11:56,075 --> 02:11:57,909
Never seen the like of it before.

2433
02:12:00,621 --> 02:12:02,163
You always knew that.

2434
02:12:03,583 --> 02:12:05,125
What this was going to be.

2435
02:12:06,961 --> 02:12:09,045
Intimate and ugly.

2436
02:12:12,216 --> 02:12:13,717
You must have needed to see it close

2437
02:12:13,801 --> 02:12:15,093
when you decided to come down here.

2438
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:17,304
Hmm.

2439
02:12:34,447 --> 02:12:38,116
We've made it possible for
one another to do terrible things.

2440
02:12:40,494 --> 02:12:42,078
We've won the war.

2441
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:46,416
Now you have to lead us out of it.

2442
02:14:18,467 --> 02:14:20,093
You have an itch to travel?

2443
02:14:20,428 --> 02:14:22,262
Mm-hmm. I'd like that.

2444
02:14:23,764 --> 02:14:26,015
To the West, by rail.

2445
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:27,475
Overseas.

2446
02:14:29,645 --> 02:14:30,812
The Holy Land.

(MARY CHUCKLES)

2448
02:14:33,816 --> 02:14:35,442
Awfully pious for a man

2449
02:14:35,526 --> 02:14:38,069
who takes his wife out
buggy-riding on Good Friday.

2450
02:14:38,821 --> 02:14:39,988
Jerusalem.

2451
02:14:40,573 --> 02:14:42,407
Where David and Solomon walked.

2452
02:14:42,742 --> 02:14:46,202
I dream of walking in that ancient city.

2453
02:14:52,501 --> 02:14:54,210
All anyone will remember of me

2454
02:14:54,295 --> 02:14:56,963
is I was crazy and
I ruined your happiness.

2455
02:14:57,715 --> 02:15:00,258
Anyone thinks that
doesn't understand, Molly.

2456
02:15:04,138 --> 02:15:05,638
When they look at you,

2457
02:15:07,141 --> 02:15:09,893
at what it cost to live at the heart of this,

2458
02:15:11,395 --> 02:15:13,646
they'll wonder at it.
They'll wonder at you.

2459
02:15:13,731 --> 02:15:14,898
They should.

2460
02:15:16,233 --> 02:15:17,442
But they should also look at

2461
02:15:17,526 --> 02:15:19,068
the wretched woman by your side

2462
02:15:19,153 --> 02:15:21,988
if they want to understand
what this was truly like.

2463
02:15:23,115 --> 02:15:24,616
For the ordinary person.

2464
02:15:25,659 --> 02:15:27,243
For anyone other than you.

2465
02:15:27,411 --> 02:15:29,162
You must try to be happier.

2466
02:15:30,122 --> 02:15:31,664
We must, both of us.

2467
02:15:32,208 --> 02:15:34,417
We've been so miserable for so long.

2468
02:15:44,094 --> 02:15:46,888
I did say some colored men...

2469
02:15:46,972 --> 02:15:49,432
The intelligent, the educated, and the

2470
02:15:49,517 --> 02:15:51,476
veterans. I qualified it.

2471
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:53,061
Mr. Stevens is furious.

2472
02:15:53,145 --> 02:15:54,854
He wants to know why you qualified it.

2473
02:15:54,939 --> 02:15:57,190
No one heard
the intelligent or educated part.

2474
02:15:57,274 --> 02:15:59,317
All they heard was the first time

2475
02:15:59,401 --> 02:16:02,111
any president has ever made mention

2476
02:16:02,196 --> 02:16:03,530
of Negro voting.

2477
02:16:03,906 --> 02:16:07,700
Still, I wish I'd mentioned it
in a better speech.

2478
02:16:07,785 --> 02:16:09,536
Mr. Stevens also wants to know

2479
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:11,454
why you didn't make a better speech.

2480
02:16:12,915 --> 02:16:14,082
-(ALL CHUCKLING)
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)

2481
02:16:14,166 --> 02:16:15,458
NICOLAY: Mrs. Lincoln is
waiting in the carriage.

2482
02:16:15,584 --> 02:16:18,044
She wants me to remind you
of the hour, and that

2483
02:16:18,128 --> 02:16:20,922
you'll have to pick up
Miss Harris and Major Rathbone.

2484
02:16:24,426 --> 02:16:26,261
-Am I in trouble?
-No, sir.

2485
02:16:26,762 --> 02:16:28,137
Thank you, Mr. Slade.

2486
02:16:43,696 --> 02:16:45,154
I suppose it's time to go.

2487
02:16:46,782 --> 02:16:48,408
Though I would rather stay.

(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS)

2493
02:18:18,207 --> 02:18:20,583
The President has been shot!

2494
02:18:21,543 --> 02:18:23,378
(AUDIENCE GASPS)

2495
02:18:23,545 --> 02:18:24,796
The President

2496
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:27,632
has been shot! At Ford's Theater!

2497
02:18:28,050 --> 02:18:29,133

(WOMEN SHRIEKING)

2499
02:18:33,305 --> 02:18:35,515
No. No!

2500
02:18:36,058 --> 02:18:38,393
(SCREAMS)

2501
02:19:09,508 --> 02:19:12,844
It's 7:22 in the morning.

2502
02:19:13,887 --> 02:19:15,596
Saturday, the 15th of April.

2503
02:19:15,681 --> 02:19:16,973
It's all over.

2504
02:19:17,057 --> 02:19:18,474
The President is no more.

2505
02:19:22,229 --> 02:19:24,188
Now he belongs to the ages.

2506
02:19:30,529 --> 02:19:32,280
LINCOLN: Fondly do we hope,

2507
02:19:33,949 --> 02:19:35,992
fervently do we pray,

2508
02:19:37,536 --> 02:19:40,496
that this mighty scourge of war,

2509
02:19:40,581 --> 02:19:42,540
may speedily pass away.

2510
02:19:45,627 --> 02:19:48,171
Yet if God wills that it continue

2511
02:19:48,797 --> 02:19:51,132
until all the wealth piled

2512
02:19:51,216 --> 02:19:54,343
by the bondman's 250 years

2513
02:19:54,428 --> 02:19:57,472
of unrequited toil shall be sunk

2514
02:19:58,807 --> 02:20:02,894
and until every drop of blood
drawn with the lash

2515
02:20:02,978 --> 02:20:06,647
shall be paid by another
drawn with the sword

2516
02:20:07,941 --> 02:20:10,318
as was said 3,000 years ago,

2517
02:20:10,402 --> 02:20:12,612
so still it must be said,

2518
02:20:13,489 --> 02:20:15,323
"The judgments of the Lord

2519
02:20:16,241 --> 02:20:20,620
"are true and righteous altogether."

2520
02:20:26,335 --> 02:20:28,044
With malice toward none,

2521
02:20:30,255 --> 02:20:32,298
with charity for all,

2522
02:20:33,967 --> 02:20:35,676
with firmness in the right,

2523
02:20:35,761 --> 02:20:38,054
as God gives us to see the right,

2524
02:20:38,138 --> 02:20:41,307
let us strive on to finish
the work we are in,

2525
02:20:42,059 --> 02:20:44,393
to bind up the nation's wounds,

2526
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:46,729
to care

2527
02:20:47,064 --> 02:20:49,398
for him who shall have borne the battle

2528
02:20:50,692 --> 02:20:52,610
and for his widow

2529
02:20:53,237 --> 02:20:54,487
and his orphan,

2530
02:20:56,240 --> 02:21:00,409
to do all which may achieve and cherish

2531
02:21:01,578 --> 02:21:06,207
a just and a lasting peace
among ourselves

2532
02:21:07,626 --> 02:21:09,669
