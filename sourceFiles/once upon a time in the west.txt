4
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,269
Hey!

5
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,063
If you want any tickets,

6
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:50,776
you'll have to go around
to the front of...

7
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,612
Well, I suppose it'll be all right.

8
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,823
What the hell am I doing
around here?

9
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,199
They walk in here and...

10
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,749
Let's see. I hope I got...

11
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,918
Three?

12
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:25,227
That'll be $7...

13
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,484
...and 50 cents.

14
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,768
Shh.

15
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,951
No.

16
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,711
Frank?

17
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,507
Frank sent us.

18
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,054
Did you bring a horse for me?

19
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,605
Well, looks like we're...

20
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,275
Looks like we're shy one horse.

21
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,450
You brought two too many.

22
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,945
Hey, Pa!

23
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,405
Look!

24
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:16,349
That's enough for now.
It's getting late. Come on home.

25
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,025
Boo!

26
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,406
Timmy.

27
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,001
Maureen, look.

28
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Hmm.

29
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,382
Ah!

30
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,461
What you doing there?
Go inside, quick, and get washed.

31
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,214
And don't touch the apple pie
or the roast.

32
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,842
Patrick's already left
for the station, huh?

33
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,802
He's getting ready, Pa.

34
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,138
- Damn it, Patrick!
- Coming, Pa.

35
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,852
Not bad, I'd say.

36
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,941
Bigger, them slices. What the hell?
We're throwing a party, ain't we?

37
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,361
But these are the same
slices as usual.

38
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,242
Yeah, sure.

39
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,787
As usual.

40
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,874
Maureen.

41
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:54,549
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices
as big as a door if you want to.

42
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,468
You'll have beautiful new clothes

43
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,345
and you won't have to
work no more.

44
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,391
We're going to get rich, Pa?

45
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,897
Who knows?

46
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,233
Patrick!

47
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,902
Wait a minute!

48
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,073
Look at the filth on your boots.
Clean them.

49
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,122
The train will come in

50
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,040
and there won't be no one
to meet your mother.

51
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,586
Our mother died six years ago.

52
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,349
Go now, or you'll really be late.

53
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,690
Just a minute. Listen, Pa.
How am I gonna recognize her?

54
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,900
You can't make no mistake,
Patrick.

55
00:19:54,985 --> 00:20:00,656
She's young and she's pretty
and she's a lady.

56
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:06,954
"For traveling,
I'll be wearing a black dress

57
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:14,170
"and the same straw hat
that I was wearing when we met."

58
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,434
I'm gonna get some fresh water
from the well.

59
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,481
Oh, Danny boy

60
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:37,735
The pipes, the pipes are calling

61
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:44,075
And down the mountain side

62
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,951
The summer's gone

63
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:50,373
And all the roses fall...

64
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,097
Maureen!

65
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,352
What are we gonna do
with this one, Frank?

66
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,911
Now that you've called
me by name...

67
00:25:56,971 --> 00:25:59,139
I saw some mighty fine stock
down south.

68
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,808
Is that so?

69
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,352
And the prices are good.

70
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,156
- These your valises, ma'am?
- Yes.

71
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,409
- Come, Sarah.
- Bring them other two.

72
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,786
We'll tote them for you, ma'am.

73
00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:44,727
Is that true? The sawmill
needs hands?

74
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,646
- Was yesterday.
- Why didn't you tell your brother?

75
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,441
- Hiya, Gramps.
- Hiya, Bill. We're back again.

76
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,901
Come on. Get a move on, will you?

77
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,611
Ha!

78
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:58,073
Get the lead out of your asses,
you redskin warriors.

79
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,367
I got a whole train to unload.

80
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,620
All right,
chuck down those feed sacks first.

81
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,165
Come on! Come on!

82
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,418
What's the name of the place
you wanted to go?

83
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,462
Sweetwater.

84
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,923
Hmm?

85
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,716
Brett McBain's farm.

86
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,262
McBain? Yeah, sure.

87
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,765
That stubborn redheaded Irishman,

88
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:13,727
tilling sand for years way out there
in the middle of nowhere.

89
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:15,604
Sweetwater!

90
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,648
Only a loony like him could call

91
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,817
that stinking piece of desert
Sweetwater.

92
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,236
Sweetwater!

93
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,992
That's good! Sweetwater!

94
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,664
That's right.
A little more to the right.

95
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,541
Higher. Higher.

96
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,003
Hold it there.

97
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,390
Here they are.
Even got here with their damn rails.

98
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,893
They caught up with us again,
eh, Lafayette? Let's go!

99
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,771
Hey, slow down.
What's the matter with you? Slow down!

100
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,815
Hey, boys! Watch out!

101
00:31:43,317 --> 00:31:45,110
Watch out down there!

102
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,611
Slow down!

103
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,464
Whoa!

104
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:55,347
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.

105
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,724
Don't the train stop?

106
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,334
What can I do for you, ma'am?

107
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,170
I would like some water,
if it's no trouble.

108
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,421
Water?

109
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,841
Well, you see, that word
is poison around these parts

110
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,219
ever since the days of the great flood.

111
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,722
- You mean you never wash?
- We sure do!

112
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:03,516
Well, I'd like to use the same facilities
you people do.

113
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,143
You sure can.

114
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,270
Just happen to have
a full tub in the back.

115
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,647
And you're lucky.

116
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,649
Only three people
have used it this morning.

117
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,236
Used it one at a time or all together?

118
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:22,244
I can tell you're accustomed
to fine living.

119
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,497
Bet you come from
one of those big eastern cities.

120
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,958
- New Orleans.
- New Orleans!

121
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,210
- You've been there?
- No.

122
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,921
But I got a cousin down there.
She runs a bar.

123
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,257
You know, she...

124
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,484
Jug.

125
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:27,614
Do you only know how to play
or do you know how to shoot?

126
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,746
Do you know how to blow music
from that?

127
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,809
Pick it up.

128
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,795
You!

129
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,346
You don't know how to play.

130
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,455
Try this one.

131
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,055
Take it.

132
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,743
Go on.

133
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,422
Here.

134
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,839
Bravo.

135
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:57,281
Cheyenne.

136
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,575
We thought we'd never make it.

137
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,495
It's all right. You're right on time.

138
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,291
To bury my escort.

139
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:11,587
If I'd waited for you, I'd be in jail by now.

140
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,772
Hey.

141
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,158
The gun.

142
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,266
You interested in fashions, Harmonica?

143
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,817
I saw three of these dusters
a short time ago.

144
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:15,902
They were waiting for a train.

145
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,578
Inside the dusters,
there were three men.

146
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,706
So?

147
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,795
Inside the men, there were three bullets.

148
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:48,392
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

149
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,063
For two reasons.

150
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:55,942
One, nobody around
these parts got the guts

151
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,945
to wear those dusters
except Cheyenne's men.

152
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:03,658
Two, Cheyenne's men don't get killed.

153
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,455
That surprise you?

154
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:11,499
Yeah.

155
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,964
Well, you know music.

156
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,884
And you can count.
All the way up to two.

157
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,895
All the way up to six, if I have to.

158
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,982
And maybe faster than you.

159
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,956
Yeah, go on.

160
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,292
Play, Harmonica.

161
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,044
Play, so you can't bullshit.

162
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,173
Only, watch those false notes.

163
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,642
Like so?

164
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,950
And so, this cousin of mine

165
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,869
keeps writing me
to come on down to New Orleans.

166
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,664
"Come on down. Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money."

167
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:36,918
I don't think I'd get along in a big city.

168
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,462
It's too full of fast men
and loose women.

169
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,048
Begging your pardon, ma'am. Ah, no.

170
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:47,386
Now, I'm too used to
a quiet, simple country life.

171
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,789
He's Timmy.

172
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,957
Yes.

173
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,752
Dear God.

174
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,214
On the day...

175
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,676
On the very day of your wedding.

176
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,845
Poor little miss.

177
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,349
Mrs...

178
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,852
Mrs. McBain.

179
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,772
But we all... Oh, but we thought...

180
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,358
I know.

181
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,693
It was to be a surprise today.

182
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,864
Brett McBain and I were married.

183
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,991
A month ago.

184
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,744
In New Orleans.

185
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,638
"I am the resurrection,
and the life.

186
00:50:17,722 --> 00:50:21,350
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

187
00:50:21,434 --> 00:50:24,895
"Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die."

188
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,105
Amen.

189
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,790
- Mr. Bennett!
- What's he doing here?

190
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,880
I found this collar on a nail by the door.

191
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:58,637
You got no way of knowing,
but this is as good as a signature.

192
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,806
Cheyenne's hand.

193
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:06,187
- But why?
- Don't worry, Mrs. McBain.

194
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,814
We'll make them tell us
before we hang them.

195
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,234
Let's get moving.

196
00:51:31,504 --> 00:51:32,755
Come on.

197
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,633
Let's go back to Flagstone.

198
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,429
No, Sam.

199
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,432
You go back.

200
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,436
You don't want to stay out here alone.

201
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,439
Why not?

202
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,483
This is my home.

203
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,348
You know, Wobbles,

204
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:56,935
I'm kind of mad at you.

205
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,275
Frank wasn't there.

206
00:56:04,777 --> 00:56:06,987
He sent three friends.

207
00:56:07,071 --> 00:56:09,781
I don't know nothing, I swear.

208
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:14,495
I only arranged the meeting
the way you wanted it.

209
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:17,956
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.

210
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:21,877
- I swear to you that I...
- 'Cause he was at the McBains'.

211
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,214
That's not true. Cheyenne did that job.

212
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:28,091
Everyone knows that. We got proof.

213
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:30,552
That was always one of Frank's tricks.

214
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,387
Faking evidence.

215
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,849
I don't know.

216
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,476
I swear.

217
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,939
I only arranged the meeting. I swear.

218
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:44,483
I don't know nothing.

219
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,521
Who's there?

220
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,717
Did you make coffee?

221
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,097
Make it.

222
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,774
Didn't sleep a wink.

223
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:40,987
A pack of turds dressed in black
rode herd on me the whole damn night.

224
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:46,827
Yeah, but I left them
in the middle of the desert.

225
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:49,120
If they're lucky,
they'll be home in three days.

226
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:11,977
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

227
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:22,153
They want to hang me,
the big black crows.

228
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:25,740
Idiots.

229
01:02:26,158 --> 01:02:27,993
What the hell?

230
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:31,246
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.

231
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:34,040
Be like killing a priest.

232
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:37,043
A Catholic priest, that is.

233
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:41,089
Yeah, the world is full of people
who hate Cheyenne.

234
01:02:56,647 --> 01:03:00,817
See, I ain't the mean bastard
people make out.

235
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:09,200
Of course, if somebody
had a mind to kill me,

236
01:03:11,495 --> 01:03:13,038
it fires me up.

237
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:17,667
And a fired-up Cheyenne

238
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,880
ain't a nice thing to see.

239
01:03:22,506 --> 01:03:24,716
Especially for a lady.

240
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:40,565
But you're too smart to make him mad.

241
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:50,241
So this here's where I was
supposed to do all the killing? Hmm?

242
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,243
Yeah.

243
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,248
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.

244
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:07,759
Now, if somebody gets dressed up
to look like me,

245
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,182
so they can hang this thing
around my neck,

246
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,602
I don't like it none.

247
01:04:18,854 --> 01:04:20,814
But I can understand it.

248
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:24,943
Hmm.

249
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:29,197
What I don't understand is why.

250
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,701
Neither do I.

251
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:40,792
But I see you looked a lot for the why.

252
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,259
Yeah.

253
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:55,056
What if there were
a whole heap of whys?

254
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:59,227
Round. Yellow.

255
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,480
You know the kind.

256
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,817
You rap them on a stone

257
01:05:06,902 --> 01:05:08,778
and they go "ding."

258
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,697
Maybe.

259
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:15,493
But I didn't find them.

260
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:18,788
Hmm.

261
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,751
By the way,

262
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:27,130
you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica?

263
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:31,968
He's somebody you'd remember.

264
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,264
Instead of talking, he plays.

265
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,310
And when he'd better play, he talks.

266
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:48,443
You know, ma'am, when you've
killed four, it's easy to make it five.

267
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:55,200
Sure. You're an expert.

268
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:02,999
Ma'am, it seems to me
you ain't caught the idea.

269
01:06:07,963 --> 01:06:10,256
Of course I have.

270
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:14,594
I'm here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money.

271
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:18,348
If you want to, you can lay me
over the table and amuse yourself.

272
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,308
And even call in your men.

273
01:06:20,392 --> 01:06:23,228
Well, no woman ever died from that.

274
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:26,981
When you're finished, all I'll need
will be a tub of boiling water,

275
01:06:27,399 --> 01:06:29,818
and I'll be exactly what I was before.

276
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:33,738
With just another filthy memory.

277
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,423
You make good coffee, at least?

278
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,717
Not bad.

279
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:56,970
Congratulations.

280
01:06:57,638 --> 01:07:01,141
Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

281
01:07:01,433 --> 01:07:03,643
I only told you to scare them.

282
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,397
People scare better when they're dying.

283
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:11,568
And can you tell me what good
was your stupid massacre?

284
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,155
Now, a Mrs. McBain has turned up.

285
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:21,161
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.

286
01:07:21,453 --> 01:07:24,789
Let's say this is something
I didn't plan on.

287
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:28,459
I have no time for surprises, Frank.

288
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,671
You know that.

289
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:36,551
I got on board in sight of the Atlantic,

290
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:38,887
and before my eyes rot,

291
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:44,559
I want to see the blue of the Pacific
outside that window.

292
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,104
I know where you got on board.

293
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:50,815
I was there, too, remember?

294
01:07:55,696 --> 01:08:01,326
"To  remove small
obstacles from the track," you said.

295
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,996
Well, there were a few.

296
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:12,045
But we traveled a long way,
just the same.

297
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,171
And fast.

298
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:17,800
Even tuberculosis of the bones
travels fast.

299
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:23,473
Don't play the sick man with me,
Mr. Morton.

300
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:27,018
I knew you
when you were just barely limping.

301
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:33,858
I watch that dry rot rise
a little more every day.

302
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,905
Any normal man would
put a bullet in his brain.

303
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:43,117
But you, you just got a little more hasty.

304
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:46,204
Otherwise you ain't changed any.

305
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:48,831
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

306
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,291
A lot.

307
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:55,213
You used to take care
of certain things personally.

308
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,592
Now, you're keeping in the background.

309
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:04,222
You'll end up giving orders.

310
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:09,811
It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

311
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:15,275
You're gonna need somebody more
and more every day to stay near you.

312
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:18,945
- Like a friend.
- Or like a partner.

313
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,238
Hmm?

314
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:33,126
How does it feel
sitting behind that desk, Frank?

315
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,923
It's almost like holding a gun.

316
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:46,431
Only much more powerful.

317
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:05,533
You see, staying with you,

318
01:10:07,619 --> 01:10:10,455
I'm beginning to think big, too.

319
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,543
This McBain business

320
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:19,464
has given me ideas.

321
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:29,724
I'm sorry for you, Frank.
You're doing your best.

322
01:10:31,643 --> 01:10:34,187
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

323
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:38,232
Why?

324
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:43,988
Because there are many things
you'll never understand.

325
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,667
This is one of them.

326
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:01,381
You see, Frank,
there are many kinds of weapons.

327
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:06,302
And the only one
that can stop that is this.

328
01:12:00,732 --> 01:12:03,651
Now, shall we get back
to our little problem?

329
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:09,657
My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr. Morton,

330
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:14,954
but they can still shoot holes
big enough for our little problems.

331
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:19,250
Pretty soon the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

332
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:24,922
You wake up one morning and say,
"World, I know you.

333
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,800
"From now on,
there are no more surprises."

334
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:30,678
And then you happen
to meet a man like this,

335
01:12:30,762 --> 01:12:32,346
who looked like a good man.

336
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,932
Clear eyes, strong hands.

337
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,351
And he wants to marry you.

338
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:39,604
Which doesn't happen often.

339
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:43,024
And he says he's rich, too,
which doesn't hurt.

340
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:49,155
So you think,
"The hell with New Orleans.

341
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,575
"Now I'll say yes
and go live in the country.

342
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:58,164
"I wouldn't mind giving him
half a dozen kids after all.

343
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:03,794
"Take care of a house.
Do something. What the hell?"

344
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:17,683
Well, God rest your soul, Brett McBain.

345
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:22,563
Even if he's going to have a job
pulling you out of the devil's grip.

346
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:41,040
Still, I swear
he'd left money around someplace.

347
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:45,044
If you can find it,
you're welcome to it.

348
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:48,464
Mrs. McBain goes back to civilization.

349
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:51,968
Minus a husband
and plus a great future.

350
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:57,557
Hmm.

351
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,941
You deserve better.

352
01:14:09,444 --> 01:14:13,322
The last man who told me that
is buried out there.

353
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,501
You know, Jill,
you remind me of my mother.

354
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:31,841
She was the biggest whore in Alameda

355
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:34,552
and the finest woman that ever lived.

356
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:39,724
Whoever my father was,
for an hour or for a month,

357
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:43,269
he must have been a happy man.

358
01:14:54,197 --> 01:14:56,449
Hey! Hey!

359
01:14:57,909 --> 01:14:59,076
Hey!

360
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,477
What do you want?

361
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,021
Cheyenne's right.

362
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:13,234
Once you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

363
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:29,709
This isn't the time to leave.

364
01:17:32,063 --> 01:17:33,814
Give me some water.

365
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:44,909
From the well.

366
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,704
I like my water fresh.

367
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:18,294
When you hear a strange sound,
drop to the ground.

368
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:22,006
A sound? Like what?

369
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,258
Like that.

370
01:19:56,249 --> 01:20:00,377
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.

371
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:35,746
Morning, Mrs. McBain.

372
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:38,749
- What brings you to town?
- Good morning.

373
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,877
Maybe you don't remember,
but yesterday at the funeral...

374
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:43,921
I remember very well.

375
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:47,174
Is there something I can do for you?

376
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:49,760
Yes.

377
01:20:52,305 --> 01:20:55,432
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.

378
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:58,519
Why is everybody hounding me
about this guy Frank?

379
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:01,230
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.

380
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:05,359
I got my own worries,
and all I want is to be left in peace.

381
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:08,988
Tell Frank I want to negotiate with him.
Personally.

382
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:07,087
You were told
not to come here for any reason.

383
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:11,216
Whatever business you have with Frank,
keep it far away from here.

384
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:12,760
Yes, I know, Mr. Morton,

385
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:14,678
but when I heard that woman say
she knew everything,

386
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,139
I thought that the important thing
was for me to come over here

387
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:18,432
right away and tell you about it.

388
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:20,559
You never thought it wasn't a trick?

389
01:22:20,977 --> 01:22:22,853
Sure, but you know
that I'm mighty careful, Frank.

390
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:25,272
No one could have followed me.

391
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:28,233
That's the first thing I learned,
working for you.

392
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:30,944
To listen unseen and to watch unheard.

393
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:35,115
You should learn to live
as if you didn't exist.

394
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:37,743
You've known me
a long time, Frank.

395
01:22:37,827 --> 01:22:39,661
You know you can trust me.

396
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,497
Wobbles.

397
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:49,880
How can you trust a man who wears
both a belt and suspenders?

398
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:53,801
The man can't even trust his own pants.

399
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:05,062
Let's get out of here.

400
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:46,580
The end of the line.

401
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,584
Yeah.

402
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,050
Get him on board.

403
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,316
Tie him up.

404
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:49,351
Wait, Frank.

405
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:51,645
I didn't...

406
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:53,522
So, nobody followed you?

407
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:56,441
No. You gotta believe me.

408
01:25:57,610 --> 01:25:59,945
So, this is the way I can trust you.

409
01:26:00,154 --> 01:26:02,948
I can explain. I didn't know that he...

410
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:06,535
- Get out.
- No. No. No, Frank.

411
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:08,829
Get out.

412
01:26:22,885 --> 01:26:23,885
Shh!

413
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:29,975
Frank, wait!

414
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:54,291
I told you to keep quiet.

415
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:01,465
Where are Logan and Jim?
They take care of the woman?

416
01:27:01,799 --> 01:27:03,508
Someone took care of them.

417
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:06,219
We found them out at McBain's place.

418
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:09,014
Stone dead. And the woman was gone.

419
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:13,143
Your friends
have a high mortality rate, Frank.

420
01:27:24,697 --> 01:27:27,240
First three, then two.

421
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:42,130
So you're the one
who makes appointments.

422
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:46,968
And you're the one
who doesn't keep them.

423
01:27:48,679 --> 01:27:50,347
What do you want?

424
01:27:51,557 --> 01:27:52,974
Who are you?

425
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:57,896
Dave Jenkins.

426
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:08,657
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.

427
01:28:09,867 --> 01:28:11,701
Calder Benson.

428
01:28:13,496 --> 01:28:16,039
What's your name? Benson's dead, too.

429
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:20,127
You ought to know, Frank,
better than anyone.

430
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:21,545
You killed him.

431
01:28:22,213 --> 01:28:23,422
Who are you?

432
01:28:23,589 --> 01:28:25,882
- Who are you, you...
- Frank!

433
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:29,469
The woman.

434
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:33,557
We're only losing time.

435
01:28:39,021 --> 01:28:40,397
All right.

436
01:28:40,731 --> 01:28:43,650
This time,
I'll take care of her personally.

437
01:28:43,901 --> 01:28:46,319
Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.

438
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:53,243
Keep him warm for me.

439
01:28:53,327 --> 01:28:55,912
If he gives you any trouble, hit him.

440
01:28:56,247 --> 01:29:00,125
Not in the mouth.
He's got to talk. And plenty.

441
01:29:05,756 --> 01:29:07,841
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

442
01:29:07,925 --> 01:29:10,677
By the way, I want you to keep an eye
on that cripple all the time.

443
01:29:10,761 --> 01:29:12,095
- Understand?
- Sure, Frank.

444
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:47,357
- See anyone?
- No.

445
01:31:07,461 --> 01:31:08,587
There he is.

446
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:54,878
You only know how to shoot?

447
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:58,673
Or do you know how to cut, too?

448
01:34:10,144 --> 01:34:11,227
Hey, you.

449
01:34:13,397 --> 01:34:15,231
Wait a minute.

450
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,610
Let's have a good look at you.

451
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:32,665
Hey. Mr. Choo-Choo.

452
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:48,973
Hmm!

453
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:53,228
It's easy to find you.

454
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:54,854
Bastard.

455
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:56,898
I don't have to kill you now.

456
01:34:56,982 --> 01:34:59,776
You leave a slime behind you
like a snail.

457
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:03,363
Two beautiful shiny rails.

458
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,241
There's another bastard.

459
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:10,119
And he's getting further away
every minute.

460
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:23,049
There it is.

461
01:35:23,133 --> 01:35:24,592
Exactly what your husband ordered
from me.

462
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:27,178
And seeing as how he paid cash
on the barrel head,

463
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:28,805
it all belongs to you.

464
01:35:29,139 --> 01:35:32,141
Oak planks, beech, pine.

465
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,269
All first-grade lumber.

466
01:35:34,353 --> 01:35:37,063
And there's beams
and foundation pylons.

467
01:35:37,356 --> 01:35:41,442
Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar,
and all these tools.

468
01:35:41,777 --> 01:35:43,862
Maybe he wanted
to enlarge the farmhouse.

469
01:35:43,946 --> 01:35:45,822
Enlarge the farmhouse?

470
01:35:46,365 --> 01:35:49,200
He could have built
at least eight of them.

471
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:50,952
By the way, ma'am,

472
01:35:51,745 --> 01:35:54,831
McBain also ordered this.
Said it was important.

473
01:35:55,624 --> 01:35:59,127
Only it seems he forgot to tell me
what he wanted printed on it.

474
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:08,303
Station.

475
01:36:09,972 --> 01:36:10,972
How's that again?

476
01:36:11,473 --> 01:36:13,349
I said print "station."

477
01:36:45,841 --> 01:36:47,467
Looking for this?

478
01:36:48,218 --> 01:36:50,887
I've had enough of your butcher tactics.

479
01:36:50,971 --> 01:36:52,889
I know that woman is here.

480
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:56,017
I don't want any more useless killing.

481
01:36:57,102 --> 01:36:59,437
I'm ready to make a deal for that land.

482
01:36:59,521 --> 01:37:01,481
To pay what's necessary.

483
01:37:01,565 --> 01:37:04,067
I don't want to waste any more time.

484
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:07,236
You've made a big mistake, Morton.

485
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:15,828
When you're not on that train,
you look like a turtle out of its shell.

486
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:17,747
Just funny.

487
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:19,624
Poor cripple talking big

488
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:22,377
so nobody will know
how scared you are.

489
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:24,379
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

490
01:37:27,299 --> 01:37:29,092
I don't have time to compete with you.

491
01:37:35,599 --> 01:37:36,808
Compete?

492
01:37:40,896 --> 01:37:42,563
Why, you...

493
01:37:42,648 --> 01:37:45,900
You can't even stand
on your own feet by yourself.

494
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:59,288
Is that sufficient
to make you feel stronger?

495
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:02,750
I could squash you like a wormy apple.

496
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:08,256
Sure, but you won't do it.

497
01:38:09,299 --> 01:38:12,635
Because it's not to your advantage.

498
01:38:19,768 --> 01:38:22,979
Who knows how far you'd have gone
with two good legs. Huh?

499
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:34,240
Help him back to the train.
Keep your eye on him.

500
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:40,079
Morton. Don't worry about the land.

501
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:42,081
If you feel like paying for it, you can pay.

502
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:44,000
Of course, it won't make
any difference to you

503
01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:46,169
dealing with the new owner.

504
01:39:12,863 --> 01:39:15,406
Cheyenne! Hey, Cheyenne!

505
01:39:16,241 --> 01:39:18,785
There's a square staked out here.
it says "water tank."

506
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:22,914
Over here, too.
Only, it says "post office."

507
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,208
And this one says "corral."

508
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:28,294
And this here "church."

509
01:39:29,004 --> 01:39:30,755
What the hell is this?

510
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:32,548
Can't you see?

511
01:39:33,717 --> 01:39:35,259
It's a station.

512
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:38,679
And all around it, a town.

513
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:43,267
Brett McBain's town.

514
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:47,522
Was he crazy!

515
01:39:49,191 --> 01:39:51,484
Yeah, in a very special way.

516
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:54,445
An Irishman.

517
01:39:56,448 --> 01:39:57,490
He knew, sooner or later,

518
01:39:57,574 --> 01:40:00,868
that railroad coming through Flagstone
would continue on west.

519
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:03,788
So he looked over
all this country out here

520
01:40:04,873 --> 01:40:07,542
until he found this hunk of desert.

521
01:40:07,626 --> 01:40:09,752
Nobody wanted it.

522
01:40:13,757 --> 01:40:15,049
But he bought it.

523
01:40:17,803 --> 01:40:22,348
Then he tightened his belt,
and for years, he waited.

524
01:40:24,059 --> 01:40:25,643
Waited for what?

525
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:29,689
For the railroad to reach this point.

526
01:40:30,566 --> 01:40:32,775
Ah, but how in the hell could he be sure

527
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:35,778
the railroad would pass
through his property?

528
01:40:37,114 --> 01:40:40,032
Them steam engines
can't roll without water.

529
01:40:40,492 --> 01:40:45,121
And the only water for 50 miles
west of Flagstone is right here.

530
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:47,874
- Under this land.
- A-ha!

531
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:50,835
He was no fool, our dead friend, huh?

532
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:56,132
He was going to sell this piece of desert
for its weight in gold, wasn't he?

533
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:59,677
You don't sell the dream of a lifetime.

534
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:03,639
Brett McBain wanted his station.

535
01:41:06,268 --> 01:41:08,477
He got the rights to build it.

536
01:41:10,647 --> 01:41:13,399
- How do you know all this?
- I saw a document.

537
01:41:13,483 --> 01:41:16,777
It was all in order.
Seals, signatures, everything.

538
01:41:17,821 --> 01:41:19,238
One thing, though.

539
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:23,492
In very small print,
there is a short clause,

540
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:28,080
which says that McBain or his heirs
lose all rights

541
01:41:28,165 --> 01:41:31,292
if, by the time
the railroad reaches this point,

542
01:41:32,669 --> 01:41:34,837
the station ain't built yet.

543
01:41:35,589 --> 01:41:36,672
Uh-huh!

544
01:41:41,845 --> 01:41:45,932
Speaking of railroads,
I noticed the rail gang's already...

545
01:41:46,683 --> 01:41:48,226
Hey.

546
01:41:49,519 --> 01:41:53,231
I noticed the rail gang's
already behind those hills.

547
01:41:53,315 --> 01:41:57,735
And before you know it,
they're gonna be here.

548
01:41:58,195 --> 01:41:59,320
Yeah.

549
01:41:59,988 --> 01:42:01,072
Yeah.

550
01:42:02,532 --> 01:42:03,699
Listen.

551
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:05,993
Harmonica.

552
01:42:07,037 --> 01:42:10,248
A town built around the railroad.

553
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,709
You could make a fortune, huh?

554
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:17,797
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

555
01:42:19,216 --> 01:42:20,967
Hey, more than that.

556
01:42:22,427 --> 01:42:24,345
Thousands of thousands.

557
01:42:25,722 --> 01:42:27,723
They call them millions.

558
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:31,727
Millions? Hmm.

559
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:36,649
- Yeah, millions.
- Yeah.

560
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:40,987
I always thought it'd be easier
to make a deal with a smart lady.

561
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:43,531
All you gotta do is...

562
01:42:46,285 --> 01:42:49,662
Hey, what in the hell
are you standing around for?

563
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:52,331
But, chief,
what are we supposed to do?

564
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,500
What are you supposed to do?

565
01:42:54,584 --> 01:42:57,253
Build a station, idiots!

566
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:03,050
I figure it ain't gonna
look like much.

567
01:43:06,096 --> 01:43:10,016
But it'll be the first thing
she sees when she gets back.

568
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:12,893
If she gets back.

569
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:34,392
I think...

570
01:44:43,068 --> 01:44:44,193
Yeah.

571
01:44:45,404 --> 01:44:49,532
I'm beginning to think I might be
a little sorry killing you.

572
01:44:52,035 --> 01:44:53,828
You like being alive.

573
01:44:55,205 --> 01:44:56,288
Hmm?

574
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:10,803
You also like to feel
a man's hands all over you.

575
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:14,223
You like it.

576
01:45:18,645 --> 01:45:22,440
Even if they're the hands of the man
who killed your husband.

577
01:45:42,502 --> 01:45:43,752
What a...

578
01:45:47,382 --> 01:45:49,133
What a little tramp.

579
01:45:52,262 --> 01:45:56,265
Is there anything in the world
you wouldn't do to save your skin?

580
01:45:59,936 --> 01:46:01,479
Nothing, Frank.

581
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:24,960
Hmm.

582
01:46:25,337 --> 01:46:28,297
Now I understand
why they miss you so much

583
01:46:29,841 --> 01:46:33,719
down there in New Orleans.

584
01:46:36,348 --> 01:46:38,974
Great invention, the telegraph.

585
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:45,231
"Jill? The brunette?

586
01:46:45,941 --> 01:46:47,566
"My God, all the customers

587
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:50,236
"of the most elegant whorehouse
on Bourbon Street

588
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:53,322
"have been weeping ever since she left."

589
01:46:55,784 --> 01:46:57,243
Say, tell me.

590
01:46:58,745 --> 01:47:00,496
Did old McBain know?

591
01:47:01,414 --> 01:47:02,498
Yeah.

592
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,751
Yeah, I bet he did.

593
01:47:06,419 --> 01:47:09,004
He was just the type to marry a whore.

594
01:47:12,342 --> 01:47:13,425
Hey.

595
01:47:15,178 --> 01:47:16,637
It's an idea.

596
01:47:19,057 --> 01:47:20,724
I could marry you.

597
01:47:22,185 --> 01:47:24,478
And the land would become mine.

598
01:47:25,313 --> 01:47:26,564
And maybe

599
01:47:29,442 --> 01:47:31,485
you'd make a perfect wife.

600
01:47:35,865 --> 01:47:39,577
It would be me who wouldn't be
any good as a husband.

601
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:42,204
Too bad.

602
01:47:43,206 --> 01:47:45,916
We'll have to think of another solution.

603
01:47:46,334 --> 01:47:47,876
Simpler.

604
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:54,466
Quicker.

605
01:48:16,615 --> 01:48:18,782
As sheriff of this county,

606
01:48:18,867 --> 01:48:22,286
I've been asked to preside
over the sale by auction

607
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:26,915
of all property belonging
to Mrs. Jill McBain, here present.

608
01:48:27,375 --> 01:48:30,836
This parcel of land measures 320 acres.

609
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:35,174
It's free of all encumbrances,
liens and mortgages.

610
01:48:36,217 --> 01:48:38,344
This property and all it contains,

611
01:48:38,428 --> 01:48:40,679
lock, stock and barrel,

612
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:44,308
will be turned over to the lucky
purchaser at the time of sale.

613
01:48:44,392 --> 01:48:47,144
All the contents therein
are listed by number

614
01:48:47,228 --> 01:48:50,147
on the inventory sheet
distributed among you.

615
01:48:50,231 --> 01:48:54,151
The entire property will be sold
in block to the highest bidder.

616
01:48:54,235 --> 01:48:55,778
All right. That's clear to everybody.

617
01:48:57,697 --> 01:48:59,365
I declare the auction open.

618
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:02,493
Now, who's going to make the first bid?

619
01:49:07,123 --> 01:49:11,251
A list of all the
items. Some of them are worth money.

620
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:15,964
All right.
Now, who's going to make the first bid?

621
01:49:19,928 --> 01:49:21,470
$200.

622
01:49:22,472 --> 01:49:24,973
Well, I have
an opening bid of $200.

623
01:49:25,433 --> 01:49:28,894
$200. Do I hear more?

624
01:49:28,978 --> 01:49:31,730
That stinking
piece of land ain't worth it.

625
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:32,940
Is it, old-timer?

626
01:49:33,024 --> 01:49:36,068
Come on, my friends, $200.

627
01:49:36,611 --> 01:49:39,530
The livestock alone
is worth twice that much.

628
01:49:41,157 --> 01:49:42,324
Well...

629
01:49:43,535 --> 01:49:45,828
Who's going to bid $300?

630
01:49:49,874 --> 01:49:51,583
Now, look, friends,

631
01:49:51,668 --> 01:49:54,837
I realize we're not offering
California here,

632
01:49:54,921 --> 01:49:58,173
but 200 is damn little
for all that property.

633
01:49:58,258 --> 01:50:02,344
Ladies and gentlemen,
I wouldn't even take 200 as a deposit.

634
01:50:05,682 --> 01:50:09,101
Well, nobody's going to bid it up.

635
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:20,487
You're sure you wouldn't want
to set a minimum price?

636
01:50:22,615 --> 01:50:24,992
I wish I were wrong, Mrs. McBain,

637
01:50:25,076 --> 01:50:28,036
but you're liable to end up selling
the place for a plate of beans.

638
01:50:35,462 --> 01:50:37,504
All I want is to sell.

639
01:51:44,405 --> 01:51:47,157
- You look fat, huh?
- If you say so.

640
01:51:48,326 --> 01:51:50,118
- How many?
- One card.

641
01:51:52,664 --> 01:51:54,039
One for me.

642
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:58,710
Dealer takes three.

643
01:52:09,305 --> 01:52:11,598
Can I... Can I take a hand?

644
01:52:18,147 --> 01:52:19,398
Fifteen.

645
01:52:32,787 --> 01:52:34,746
Yeah, sit down.

646
01:52:58,438 --> 01:52:59,771
I'll deal.

647
01:54:44,961 --> 01:54:46,420
How do you...

648
01:54:47,797 --> 01:54:50,507
How do you play this game,
Mr. Morton?

649
01:54:53,219 --> 01:54:54,845
It's very simple.

650
01:54:56,180 --> 01:55:00,726
As long as you use your head,
you never lose.

651
01:55:01,602 --> 01:55:03,145
$500.

652
01:55:08,776 --> 01:55:10,193
$500.

653
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:12,279
Mmm-hmm.

654
01:55:12,363 --> 01:55:14,364
Do I hear any other bids?

655
01:55:16,784 --> 01:55:18,410
I don't think so.

656
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:29,129
I'm sorry, Mrs. McBain,

657
01:55:29,213 --> 01:55:34,176
but I think I'm gonna have to
knock down on that last bid.

658
01:55:45,229 --> 01:55:46,897
$500 once.

659
01:55:50,151 --> 01:55:52,360
$500 twice.

660
01:55:55,364 --> 01:55:57,824
- $500...
- $5,000.

661
01:56:21,724 --> 01:56:26,019
- You said $5,000?
- It's on its way.

662
01:56:38,991 --> 01:56:40,826
It's Cheyenne!

663
01:56:50,586 --> 01:56:53,672
The reward for this man
is $5,000, that right?

664
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:58,135
Judas was content with $4,970 less.

665
01:56:58,761 --> 01:57:01,263
There were no dollars in them days.

666
01:57:03,432 --> 01:57:05,767
But sons of bitches, yeah.

667
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:21,741
Hey, wait a minute.

668
01:57:24,078 --> 01:57:26,913
- The jail's that way.
- Yeah, I know.

669
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:30,709
Yeah, but you're going
to the railroad station.

670
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:34,296
I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.

671
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:36,423
They got a modern jail there.

672
01:57:36,757 --> 01:57:41,136
It's got more walls, more bars,
more guards.

673
01:57:41,971 --> 01:57:45,807
Oh, you'll like it, in 20 years.
You'll see.

674
01:58:47,203 --> 01:58:50,497
Two tickets, amigo,
to the next station.

675
01:58:50,581 --> 01:58:52,040
One way only.

676
01:58:53,084 --> 01:58:54,084
Mmm-hmm.

677
01:58:54,835 --> 01:58:57,671
Here's to you. And congratulations.

678
01:59:02,551 --> 01:59:04,761
You got yourself a good deal.

679
01:59:06,222 --> 01:59:07,597
Oh, the auction.

680
01:59:08,724 --> 01:59:12,143
Forget it. I don't invest in land.

681
01:59:14,772 --> 01:59:19,234
You don't look at all like the noble
defender of poor defenseless widows.

682
01:59:21,237 --> 01:59:22,737
But then again,

683
01:59:25,616 --> 01:59:28,743
I don't look like
a poor defenseless widow.

684
01:59:35,584 --> 01:59:37,794
Cheyenne's right.
You're a remarkable woman.

685
01:59:39,797 --> 01:59:41,881
And you're a remarkable man.

686
01:59:42,717 --> 01:59:45,260
But you have something on your mind.

687
01:59:51,017 --> 01:59:53,143
And you got something on
your mind.

688
01:59:56,814 --> 02:00:00,775
Hot water. A bathtub full
of hot water.

689
02:00:19,503 --> 02:00:22,213
I think it's time I filled
that bathtub.

690
02:00:53,162 --> 02:00:54,371
Who are you?

691
02:01:15,976 --> 02:01:17,352
Jim Cooper.

692
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:20,021
Chuck Youngblood.

693
02:01:21,023 --> 02:01:22,524
More dead men.

694
02:01:26,362 --> 02:01:29,364
They were all alive
until they met you, Frank.

695
02:01:35,621 --> 02:01:38,790
You paid $5,000 for something
that belongs to me.

696
02:01:44,004 --> 02:01:45,171
5,000.

697
02:01:50,302 --> 02:01:52,220
Plus one.

698
02:01:57,768 --> 02:01:59,978
You've got a right to make
a profit, too.

699
02:02:27,089 --> 02:02:30,175
I wouldn't take too long thinking
about it, if I were you.

700
02:02:35,055 --> 02:02:37,348
You got yourself into something
that's bigger than you are.

701
02:02:37,433 --> 02:02:40,101
You got a chance to get out easy.
You better take it.

702
02:02:40,561 --> 02:02:43,271
You sound like
a real businessman, Frank.

703
02:02:44,106 --> 02:02:47,317
Being with Mr. Morton
has done you a lot of good.

704
02:02:54,867 --> 02:02:56,826
And you've learned some new methods.

705
02:02:59,163 --> 02:03:02,081
Yeah, Mr. Morton has shown you
a lot of new ways.

706
02:03:06,837 --> 02:03:09,464
Even though
you haven't given up the old ones.

707
02:03:10,716 --> 02:03:13,635
Pick any method you like.
Just make the deal.

708
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:18,097
Which deal, Frank?

709
02:03:21,227 --> 02:03:23,061
We have more than one,
you and me.

710
02:03:26,899 --> 02:03:32,403
We can lump them together
into one bundle, settle all of them.

711
02:03:33,030 --> 02:03:34,489
Here and now.

712
02:03:36,742 --> 02:03:38,493
Easy, Frank.

713
02:03:39,161 --> 02:03:40,286
Easy.

714
02:03:41,455 --> 02:03:43,623
You gotta learn not to push things.

715
02:03:43,874 --> 02:03:46,834
Taking it easy is the first thing
a businessman should do.

716
02:03:50,172 --> 02:03:53,841
I got an idea Mr. Morton
can teach you a lot more.

717
02:03:57,846 --> 02:03:59,138
How much?

718
02:04:00,516 --> 02:04:01,849
$1.

719
02:05:06,957 --> 02:05:08,583
Giddy up!

720
02:06:42,928 --> 02:06:44,345
Giddy up!

721
02:07:48,535 --> 02:07:51,204
I could swear we're going to have
that strange sound.

722
02:07:51,288 --> 02:07:52,622
Right now.

723
02:09:45,569 --> 02:09:46,986
Time sure flies.

724
02:09:48,780 --> 02:09:50,573
It's already past 12:00.

725
02:10:50,217 --> 02:10:52,593
But... But they were his men.

726
02:10:52,678 --> 02:10:55,096
- Yeah.
- And they tried to kill him.

727
02:10:55,555 --> 02:10:57,431
They must have found somebody
who pays better.

728
02:10:57,516 --> 02:10:58,557
And you!

729
02:10:58,976 --> 02:11:00,851
You saved his life.

730
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:06,607
I didn't let them kill him
and that's not the same thing.

731
02:11:19,454 --> 02:11:20,871
Sure.

732
02:11:21,456 --> 02:11:23,916
It's not the same thing.

733
02:11:31,258 --> 02:11:32,842
You get dressed.

734
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:34,677
It's time to go home.

735
02:16:54,289 --> 02:16:56,040
Did you make coffee?

736
02:16:57,584 --> 02:16:59,168
This time I did.

737
02:17:39,667 --> 02:17:40,751
Good.

738
02:17:43,380 --> 02:17:46,507
My mother used to make
coffee this way.

739
02:17:47,342 --> 02:17:52,012
Hot, strong and good.

740
02:18:01,523 --> 02:18:03,190
- Cheyenne.
- Huh?

741
02:18:05,402 --> 02:18:07,736
What's he waiting for out there?

742
02:18:10,365 --> 02:18:11,490
What's he doing?

743
02:18:17,497 --> 02:18:19,915
He's whittling on a piece of wood.

744
02:18:22,460 --> 02:18:25,170
I got a feeling when he
stops whittling,

745
02:18:26,631 --> 02:18:30,926
something's gonna happen.

746
02:19:37,202 --> 02:19:39,203
Surprised to see me here?

747
02:19:41,331 --> 02:19:42,998
I knew you'd come.

748
02:20:06,689 --> 02:20:09,691
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.

749
02:20:11,027 --> 02:20:12,819
Now I understand why.

750
02:20:15,156 --> 02:20:19,493
Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing
you were around somewhere alive.

751
02:20:20,662 --> 02:20:23,997
So you found out
you're not a businessman after all?

752
02:20:24,541 --> 02:20:25,707
Just a man.

753
02:20:28,378 --> 02:20:30,003
An ancient race.

754
02:20:36,386 --> 02:20:40,681
Other Mortons will be along
and they'll kill it off.

755
02:20:41,057 --> 02:20:43,016
The future don't matter to us.

756
02:20:43,893 --> 02:20:45,102
Nothing matters now.

757
02:20:45,186 --> 02:20:48,522
Not the land, not the money,
not the woman.

758
02:20:49,148 --> 02:20:51,024
I came here to see you.

759
02:20:53,611 --> 02:20:56,697
'Cause I know that now
you'll tell me what you're after.

760
02:21:12,005 --> 02:21:14,089
Only at the point of dying.

761
02:21:17,427 --> 02:21:18,635
I know.

762
02:22:03,306 --> 02:22:07,017
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.

763
02:22:07,977 --> 02:22:10,103
Put it there, please.

764
02:22:12,523 --> 02:22:16,234
So I can watch the railroad move up
while I shave.

765
02:22:22,742 --> 02:22:24,117
You know what?

766
02:22:25,912 --> 02:22:28,580
If I was you, I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

767
02:22:38,216 --> 02:22:39,841
You can't imagine

768
02:22:41,135 --> 02:22:44,304
how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

769
02:22:46,766 --> 02:22:48,517
Just to look at her.

770
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:55,482
And if one of them
should pat your behind,

771
02:22:57,527 --> 02:23:00,153
just make believe it's nothing.

772
02:23:03,116 --> 02:23:04,658
They earned it.

773
02:27:38,933 --> 02:27:41,267
Keep your loving brother happy.

774
02:31:00,217 --> 02:31:02,635
Who... Who are you?

775
02:32:10,412 --> 02:32:14,249
Hey. You're sort of a handsome man.

776
02:32:17,378 --> 02:32:19,420
But I'm not the right man.

777
02:32:32,309 --> 02:32:33,977
And neither is he.

778
02:32:36,814 --> 02:32:38,147
Maybe not.

779
02:32:38,732 --> 02:32:40,233
But it doesn't matter.

780
02:32:44,613 --> 02:32:46,739
You don't understand, Jill.

781
02:32:48,284 --> 02:32:51,244
People like that have
something inside.

782
02:32:53,580 --> 02:32:55,873
Something to do with death.

783
02:32:59,253 --> 02:33:03,423
If that fella lives,
he'll come in through that door,

784
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:06,592
pick up his gear and say adis.

785
02:33:12,349 --> 02:33:14,976
It would be nice to
see this town grow.

786
02:34:47,027 --> 02:34:48,361
Now I gotta go.

787
02:35:34,658 --> 02:35:38,244
Gonna be a beautiful town, Sweetwater.

788
02:35:42,916 --> 02:35:45,251
I hope you'll come back someday.

789
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:04,270
Someday.

790
02:36:16,658 --> 02:36:20,536
Yeah. I gotta go, too.

791
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:48,523
Make believe it's nothing.

792
02:38:54,107 --> 02:38:55,775
Sorry, Harmonica.

793
02:38:56,318 --> 02:38:58,319
I gotta stay here.

794
02:39:36,900 --> 02:39:37,983
Who?

795
02:39:41,697 --> 02:39:43,698
I ran into Mr. Choo-Choo.

796
02:39:44,741 --> 02:39:48,160
I didn't count on
that half-man from the train.

797
02:39:48,995 --> 02:39:51,038
He got scared.

798
02:40:09,474 --> 02:40:11,016
Hey, Harmonica.

799
02:40:12,519 --> 02:40:14,270
When they do you in,

800
02:40:15,021 --> 02:40:17,523
pray it's somebody
who knows where to shoot.

801
02:40:33,373 --> 02:40:34,498
Go away.

802
02:40:37,544 --> 02:40:38,794
Go away.

803
02:40:39,504 --> 02:40:42,548
Go away.
I don't want you to see me die.
