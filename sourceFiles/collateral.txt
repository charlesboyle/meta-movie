1
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,449
[airplane landing]

2
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,392
[wheels touching down]

3
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:37,160
[chattering]

4
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,297
[footsteps]

5
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:47,201
[loudspeaker, people chattering]

6
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,727
- You okay?
- I'm fine, mate. Don't worry about it.

7
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,806
You all right?

8
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,174
Enjoy L.A.

9
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:47,397
[speaks French]

10
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,108
[men yelling in Spanish]

11
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,235
He did it.

12
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:31,340
[silence]

13
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,317
- [man] Everthing's always about you.
- [woman] It's not.

14
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:12,050
That gearhead was being sarcastic
and you know it.

15
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,456
- I just didn't see it that way.
- Bullshit.

16
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,688
What about the dig
about the makeover?

17
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,629
What do you want me to do?
I work with him, for chrissake.

18
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,132
You're capable of taking care
of your own shit.

19
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,727
You know something? Last time I checked,
you were sleeping with me.

20
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,739
So unless you want to start fucking him,
I suggest...

21
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:01,506
[both speaking Spanish]

22
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,964
Hey, pal. Where can I catch a shuttle
to the airport around here?

23
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,558
- Right there.
- Thanks.

24
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,475
It was him in that gold Lexus
with the cell phone.

25
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,046
Are they still asking for
a change of venue?

26
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:54,388
He's enhanceable because
of priors in the early '80s.

27
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,731
- Where to?
- Downtown. 31 2 North Spring Street.

28
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,130
Downtown.

29
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:10,266
Look, the transcriptions need to be done
by 7 a.m., period, okay?

30
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,673
Hold on. Take Sepulveda
to Slauson to La Brea.

31
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,046
Take La Brea north to 6th,
into downtown.

32
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,880
So what? You'll be up late.

33
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,615
I'm pulling an all-nighter too,
so save the tears.

34
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,556
- I'll take 105 east to the 110. It's faster.
- What?

35
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,219
The 105 to the 110
will get you there quicker.

36
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,889
The 110 turns into a parking lot
around USC.

37
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:36,162
But once you get to La Brea
north of Santa Monica, it's jammed.

38
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,672
The 110 north of the 10, you get people
driving to Pasadena and they drive slow.

39
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:44,436
Yeah, they do, but what I do is
I get off on Grand and then l...

40
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,808
Surface roads is what you want,
that's what we'll do.

41
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,086
Are we taking bets?

42
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,089
- Are we?
- And what if you're wrong?

43
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,683
I don't think I'll be wrong,
but if I am...

44
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,557
...your ride's free.

45
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,397
Okay, you got yourself a deal.

46
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,650
- Go ahead, say it.
- Say what?

47
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,230
- Go ahead.
- I got lucky with the lights.

48
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,629
You weren't lucky.
What you were was right.

49
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,963
I was wrong...

50
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,037
...Max.

51
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,915
You mind turning that up?

52
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,450
You like the classics.

53
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,783
- I do. I used to play in high school.
- Let me guess. Woodwinds.

54
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,858
No. Strings. Never had the lungs
for wind instruments.

55
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,394
Could've fooled me the way you were
unloading on that cell phone.

56
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,258
[woman] Different instrument.

57
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:16,195
If you had just listened to me, we'd be
all bogged down in traffic right now,

58
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,532
and you would've made
an extra five bucks.

59
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:23,007
Yeah, well, you keep that 5 bucks.
Buy you something special. Go wild.

60
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,205
Really, it's not a big deal.
Nothing big here.

61
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:31,113
How many cabbies do you know get you
into an argument to save you money?

62
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,617
There were two of us.
I had to kill the other one.

63
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,687
I don't like competition.

64
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,686
Take pride in being good
at what you do?

65
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,491
What, this?
No, this is part-time.

66
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,362
This is a fill-in job.
Pay the bills.

67
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,529
But I will be the best at what I do.
But that's something else.

68
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,610
- What else?
- Just shaping up some things.

69
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,441
Like...?

70
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,782
Tell me.

71
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,579
Limo company I'm putting together.
Island Limos.

72
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,520
It'll be like a island on wheels.
A cool groove, like a club experience.

73
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,990
When you get to the airport,
you won't want to get out of my limo.

74
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,926
So I do this part-time
to get my Benz off leases...

75
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,396
staff up, get the right client list.
You know, things like that.

76
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,433
How do you like being a lawyer?

77
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,340
- What are you, psychic?
- Little bit.

78
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,410
There's the dark pinstripe suit.

79
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,275
Elegant, not too flashy.
That rules out advertising.

80
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,008
Plus a top-drawer briefcase
that you live out of.

81
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,279
And the purse. A Bottega.

82
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,252
Anyway, a man gets in my cab with
a sword, I figure he's a sushi chef.

83
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,053
- [laughing]
- You?

84
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,794
Clarence Darrow.

85
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,855
Well, no, not quite. He worked defense.
I'm a prosecutor.

86
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,400
- Big case?
- Yeah.

87
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,743
[sighs]

88
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,210
- Got us here fast.
- Of course.

89
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,908
But you didn't answer my question.

90
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,080
You like what you do?

91
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,154
Yeah.

92
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,060
But not today.

93
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,561
No, I do. Like, I can't wait.

94
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,432
I love standing in that courtroom.

95
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,799
At the same time, I get this...

96
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,634
...clenched up thing
the night before the first days.

97
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,267
Clenched up? How?

98
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,550
I think I'm going to lose.

99
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,650
I think the case sucks,
my exhibits aren't in order,

100
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,595
I'm not prepared enough, people will
find out I don't know what I'm doing

101
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,258
and I've been running a charade
all these years.

102
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,461
I represent the Department of Justice,

103
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,131
and my opening statement will fall flat
at the most important point

104
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,333
and the jury will laugh at me.

105
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,610
And then I cry.
I don't throw up.

106
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,549
A lot of people throw up.
I have a strong stomach.

107
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,817
And then I pull myself together,
I rewrite my opening statement...

108
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,552
work my exhibits and that's what I do
for the rest of the night.

109
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,561
That's my routine.

110
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,496
In the morning it starts and I'm fine.

111
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,662
You need a vacation.

112
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,172
I just had a vacation
on the Harbor Freeway.

113
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,834
Not in a cab.
You need to get your head straight.

114
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,379
Get your unified self up.
Get harmonic, you know...

115
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,643
- When did you last take a break?
- I go on vacation all the time.

116
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,184
- How often?
- A dozen times a day.

117
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,379
My favorite spot:

118
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,550
Maldives lslands.

119
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,657
It's my own private getaway.

120
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:41,825
Things get heavy for me, I take
five minutes out and I just go there.

121
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,732
And I just concentrate
on absolutely nothing.

122
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,641
- Here. Take it.
- I couldn't do that.

123
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,773
Take it because you need it
a lot more than I do.

124
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,113
And it'll help you.
I guarantee it.

125
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,497
Thanks, Max.

126
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,663
Go get 'em.

127
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,625
[tapping]

128
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,434
Hey.

129
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,700
I don't know...

130
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,210
In case you ever want to investigate

131
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,907
a Fortune 500 company, or...

132
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,445
...argue cab routes.

133
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,362
- [electronic beep]
- [unlocking]

134
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,980
[electronic beep]

135
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,149
Hey.

136
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,624
Come on, man, I'm sorry.

137
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:24,252
I didn't hear you, man. Come on.

138
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,990
I'll take you.

139
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:34,572
- Where to?
- 1039 South Union Street.

140
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,573
Gotcha.

141
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,520
- [man] How long you think this'll take?
- [Max] Seven minutes.

142
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,824
Seven. Not eight? Not six?

143
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,026
Two minutes from the 110 to Normandie.
Normandie to Venice, three minutes.

144
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,659
Over to Union is one,
plus one for "shit happens."

145
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,897
- Okay if I time you?
- Knock yourself out.

146
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,031
What do I get if you're wrong?
A free ride?

147
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,575
An apology.
Already offered my free ride today.

148
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,338
- To who?
- Some girl.

149
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,582
Did you get a date with her?

150
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,310
First time in L.A.?

151
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:23,616
No. Tell you the truth, whenever
I'm here I can't wait to leave.

152
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,619
It's too sprawled out, disconnected.
You know? That's me.

153
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,820
- You like it?
- It's my home.

154
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,954
17 million people.

155
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:36,660
It's the fifth biggest economy in the world
and nobody knows each other.

156
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,102
I read about this guy
gets on the MTA here, dies.

157
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,365
[Max] Oh.

158
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,772
Six hours he rides the subway
before anyone notices his corpse

159
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,904
doing laps around L.A.,
people on and off sitting next to him.

160
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,482
Nobody notices.

161
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,421
[man] This is the cleanest cab
I've ever been in.

162
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,014
[man] Regular ride?

163
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,320
Yeah, I share it
with the day shift guy.

164
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,895
[man] You prefer nights?

165
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,432
People are more relaxed.
Less stress, less traffic, better tips.

166
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,627
- [man] How are the benefits?
- It's not that kind of job.

167
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,366
I'm not in this for the long haul.
Just filling in.

168
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,941
Temporary while I get
some things shaped up.

169
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,509
This is just temporary.

170
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,544
- How long you been driving?
- 12 years.

171
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,739
Really?

172
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,747
What other things you putting together?

173
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,478
Um...

174
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:35,691
You know, I don't want to talk about it.
Just a little business plan.

175
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,092
- No offense. I just...
- None taken.

176
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:41,928
You're one of these guys that do
instead of talk.

177
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,002
That's cool.

178
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,169
Seven minutes.
Man, you're good.

179
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,713
- I got lucky with the lights.
- Yeah, sure.

180
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,648
You probably know
the light schedules too.

181
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,848
Listen, I'm in town on a real estate deal,
close in one night.

182
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,719
I got five stops to make.

183
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:09,555
Collect signatures, see some friends,
and then I got a 6 a.m. out of LAX.

184
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:13,097
- Why don't you hang with me?
- The car's not for hire. Against regs.

185
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,393
[scoffing] Regulations?

186
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:19,460
They don't pay you sick leave.
How much you pull down a shift?

187
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,664
- How much?
- 350, 400.

188
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,971
Well, let me tell you what,
I'll make it 600.

189
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,012
Man, I don't know.

190
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,048
An extra 1 00 you get me to LAX
and I don't run for the plane.

191
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,278
- I don't know about this.
- Yeah, you do.

192
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,820
- I don't know, man.
- Yeah, you do.

193
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,322
- 600...
- Cool. We got a deal.

194
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,518
Now, here's 300 down.
What's your name?

195
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,596
- Max.
- Max, I'm Vincent.

196
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,220
[Max] All right.

197
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,902
I can't stay double-parked here.

198
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,404
I'll meet you in the alley
behind the building.

199
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,684
Definitely not from around here.

200
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,896
[baby crying]

201
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,941
[Max] There you go.

202
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,620
[speaking Spanish on television]

203
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,977
[crashing]

204
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,553
Oh, no! Shit!

205
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,357
What the hell?!

206
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,431
Damn it!

207
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,329
My man, you all right?

208
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,425
[panting] Oh, shit. Fuck.

209
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,543
He fell on the cab.

210
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,136
He fell from up there
on the motheefucking cab.

211
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,408
Shit. I think he's dead.

212
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,347
Good guess.

213
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,825
You killed him?

214
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,658
No, I shot him.
Bullets and the fall killed him.

215
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,830
Fuck this, man.

216
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,493
- Red light, Max.
- Hold on.

217
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,471
Put your hands down.

218
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,474
- Put your hands down.
- OK.

219
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,981
- Help me out. Pop the trunk.
- What?

220
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,175
Pop the trunk.

221
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,686
- Come on, man.
- Move.

222
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,585
Come on. What you doing?

223
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,681
We're going to roll him off the roof.

224
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,784
Can't leave him here, so unless
you want him up front with you,

225
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,989
- but given the hygiene.
- Oh, shit.

226
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,532
It's only a dead guy.

227
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,932
Grab his hands.

228
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,061
- I can't do this.
- Grab his wrists.

229
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,237
- You got it?
- He's twitching and shit.

230
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,285
[Max grunting]

231
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,924
Okay. That's good enough.

232
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,596
Let's go.

233
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,433
Why don't you just take the cab?

234
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,439
- Take the cab?
- You take it.

235
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,374
I'll chill.
I'll just chill.

236
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,969
They don't know who drives
these half the time.

237
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,514
They never check.
Okay, so just take it.

238
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,878
You, me...

239
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:29,420
- You promise not to tell anybody, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

240
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,019
Promise.

241
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,887
Get in the fucking car.

242
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,793
Get in the car.

243
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,107
[tires squeal]

244
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,032
Ramone?

245
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,369
[speaks Spanish]

246
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,005
Ramone?

247
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,034
Fuck.

248
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,871
- Rampart Watch Commander,
- This is Detective Fanning, Narcotics.

249
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,145
Send two black-and-whites and
a night detective to 1 039 South Union.

250
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,482
And contact SlD. I got a crime scene.

251
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,749
Roger, 1039 South Union,

252
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,925
[cars honking]

253
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:34,238
- What are you doing?
- I got to clean up. This is a mess.

254
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:38,799
Lady Macbeth, we're sitting here
and the light's green. Leave the seats.

255
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,043
[man] Asshole!

256
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,112
You no longer have the cleanest cab
in La-La Land.

257
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,918
You got to live with that.
You focus on the job. Drive.

258
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,961
7565 Fountain. You know it?

259
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,790
- West Hollywood.
- How long you figure?

260
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,764
I don't know, 1 7 minutes.

261
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,370
Why?

262
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,937
Oh, no. Hold on, man.

263
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,806
- I told you we had other stops tonight.
- You said you had to visit friends.

264
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,606
They're somebody's friends.

265
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:18,080
You drive a cab, I make my rounds.

266
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,414
You might make it through the night,
come out 700 bucks ahead.

267
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,488
I'm not trying to piss you off,

268
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:26,955
but I can't drive you around
while you kill people. It ain't my job.

269
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,753
Tonight it is.

270
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,926
Look, you don't get it.

271
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,327
I mean it.

272
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,594
[stammering] l... I'm not up for this.

273
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,828
- [Vincent] You're stressed.
- Yes, I am.

274
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,235
[Vincent] You're stressed.
I understand that.

275
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:45,241
Now, you just keep breathing
and stay calm.

276
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:46,833
- Are you breathing?
- Shit.

277
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,539
- Are you breathing? Okay, good.
- Yes.

278
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,042
Here's the deal.

279
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:58,020
You were going to drive me tonight
and never be the wiser,

280
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:01,991
but el gordo got in front
of a window, did his high dive...

281
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:06,552
We're into plan B.
You still breathing?

282
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,998
We gotta make the best of it.
Improvise. Adapt to the environment.

283
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:13,537
Darwin. Shit happens. I Ching.
Whatever. We got to roll with it.

284
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,334
"l Ching"? You threw a man
out of a window.

285
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,205
I didn't throw him. He fell.

286
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,872
- [Max] Well, what did he do to you?
- What?

287
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,644
- [Max] What did he do to you?
- Nothing. I only met him tonight.

288
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,844
You just met him once and you kill him?

289
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,923
I should only kill people
after I get to know them?

290
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,787
- No, man.
- Six billion people on the planet,

291
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,487
and you're bent out of shape
because of one fat guy.

292
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,759
- Who was he?
- What do you care?

293
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,493
- Have you ever heard of Rwanda?
- Yes, I know Rwanda.

294
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,832
Tens of thousands killed
before sundown.

295
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,236
Nobody's killed people that fast
since Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

296
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,968
- Did you bat an eye, Max?
- What?

297
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,408
Did you join Amnesty lnternational
or Oxfam?

298
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:56,708
Save the Whale, Greenpeace
or something? No.

299
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,613
I off one fat Angeleno
and you throw a hissy fit.

300
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,379
I don't know any Rwandans.

301
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,647
You don't know the guy
in that trunk either.

302
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,313
Man.

303
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,057
If it makes you feel better,
he was a criminal

304
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,628
involved in a continuing
criminal enterprise.

305
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,221
What, you just taking out the garbage?

306
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:15,959
- Something like that.
- [siren]

307
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,331
- [officer] Pull oVer to the right,
- Shit.

308
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,135
- [Vincent] Get rid of them.
- How?

309
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:26,074
[Vincent] You're a cabby.
Talk yourself out of a ticket.

310
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,377
- Please, don't do anything.
- Then don't let me get cornered.

311
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,148
- You don't have trunk space.
- I can't believe this.

312
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,553
- Believe it.
- Don't. I'll talk to them.

313
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:43,219
[radio] A domestic disturbance,
No additional units needed,

314
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,023
He's probably married.

315
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,093
The other one has kids.
Probably his wife's pregnant.

316
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,725
- [tapping]
- I'll take care of it. I got it.

317
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,327
Just a second.

318
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,907
How you doing? My partner's going
to help you out on that side.

319
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,571
- License, registration.
- Uh, yeah.

320
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,412
I'm pulling you over
because your windshield's smashed.

321
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,614
- All this current?
- Yes, officer.

322
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,493
You have a food fight in here?

323
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:21,031
Yeah. I'll just clean it up.

324
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,392
Is this blood up here
on your windshield?

325
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,469
Yeah, uh...

326
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,131
Yeah, uh, l...

327
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,801
- I hit a deer.
- You hit a deer?

328
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,936
Yeah, over on...

329
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,813
- I was on Slauson.
- A South Central deer?

330
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:45,221
They out there. It ran right in front
of the car and I couldn't avoid it.

331
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,655
Why you still carrying a passenger?

332
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,957
I'm on my way to the depot and I could
just drop him. His drop is on my way.

333
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,657
Your cab's unsafe to drive
and we have to impound it.

334
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,166
We got to do a vehicle inventory.

335
00:28:57,268 --> 00:29:02,171
Pop the trunk and step out the vehicle.
Sir, you'll have to call another cab.

336
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,639
Is that necessary?
I'm half a mile from here.

337
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,873
I'm afraid it is. Step out the vehicle.
You too. Come on.

338
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,542
- If you open that trunk, they go inside.
- You know what, it's been a long night.

339
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:17,348
Plus, the barn is right up there.
Just give me a break.

340
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,888
This is my first fare.

341
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,117
Get out the cab.
Open the trunk.

342
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,687
Step out.
You too, sir. Please.

343
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:31,791
[radio] This is Rampart DiVision dispatch,
Shots fired at 83rd and HooVer,

344
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,605
All aVailable Precinct 26 units respond,
OVer,

345
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,335
- Partner, we got to roll.
- Roger. En route.

346
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,775
Go straight to the garage.
Have a nice night.

347
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,165
Stop here.

348
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,589
- Hands on the wheel, at 1 0 and 2.
- Why?

349
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,666
Because I say so.

350
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,871
[radio] Max, You out there,
you son of a bitch?

351
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,173
Who is that?

352
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,411
That's Lenny. Just dispatch.

353
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,919
[Lenny] I know you're there,
Answer the call,

354
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,754
- What happens if you don't?
- He just keeps calling.

355
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,829
[Lenny] Max, answer,

356
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,899
Don't blow it.

357
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:17,605
- Lenny, what's up? It's me.
- Just got off the phone with the cops,

358
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,576
Desk sergeant called to check
if you brought the cab in,

359
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,077
Yeah, so?

360
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,205
So aside from
I hate talking to cops,

361
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,476
they tell me you crashed
the goddamn cab?

362
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:30,042
No. No, I got crashed into. I didn't...

363
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:33,317
Do I care what, where, why?
You're paying,

364
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,460
It was an accident.
You're not liable.

365
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,127
It was an accident.
I'm not liable.

366
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,034
I'm making you liable,
It's coming out of your pocket,

367
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,232
T ell him to stick this cab
up his fat ass.

368
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,172
- I can't. That's my boss.
- So?

369
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:55,007
- I need my job.
- No, you don't.

370
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,614
[Lenny] You still there?
I'm talking to you,

371
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,547
He's not paying you
a damn thing.

372
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,620
[Lenny] Who the hell is this?

373
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,650
Albert Riccardo, Asst. U.S. Attorney.

374
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,558
A passenger in this cab
and I'm reporting you to the DMV.

375
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,221
[Lenny] Let's not get excited,

376
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,960
How do I not get excited, listening to you
try to extort a working man?

377
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,434
You know goddamn well
your collision policy

378
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,937
and liability umbrella
will cover the damages.

379
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,600
What are you trying to pull,
you sarcastic prick?

380
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,836
- [Lenny] I was just,,,
- Tell it to him.

381
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,436
Here, tell him he's an asshole.
Go ahead.

382
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,572
You're an asshole.

383
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:36,313
Tell him he pulls this shit again,
you'll stick this yellow cab up his fat ass.

384
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,319
And next time you pull any shit...

385
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:45,385
I'll have to stick this yellow cab
up your fat ass.

386
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,804
Crazy.

387
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,211
Shit!

388
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,474
[phone ringing]

389
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:08,985
[on TV],,,where a man wants his wife
back or a boyfriend-girlfriend thing,

390
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,055
We hear, "Get your protectiVe order, "

391
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,180
[man] A protectiVe order's
a tool we use,

392
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:17,091
but often times it's just
a piece of paper to the stalker,

393
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:22,031
- [man] Mr, Clarke, there 's a notary here,
- Did he identify himself as a notary?

394
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,760
Yes, he did,

395
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:26,428
All right, sure, send him up.

396
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:29,097
[woman on TV] Or shoots them?
That happens too often,

397
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,004
[man on TV] But we use it as a tool,

398
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:34,340
I say a lot of times,
in this situation

399
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,072
strangers may write or call,

400
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,944
But how often, in fact, are stalkers

401
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,077
people that the recipient
of those affections knows?

402
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,561
[honking]

403
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,064
[Max] Hey, I'm in the cab!

404
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,502
Hey!

405
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,539
Shit. Down here in the alley!

406
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,540
Shit.

407
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,903
[honking]

408
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,408
Hey, hold up.

409
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,117
Oh, man, yeah.

410
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,388
Yeah, right there.
I'm in the cab, man, I'm stuck.

411
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,360
Thank you. Thank you.

412
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,263
Hey, look, I got to get out of here.

413
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,669
What's up? What's going on?

414
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,203
This guy tied me up,

415
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:36,739
but he's in this building,
doing wild shit.

416
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,935
- I need to get out of here.
- You all tied up in there, huh?

417
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:43,172
- Get me out so we can call the cops.
- Give me your wallet.

418
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:46,717
- Are you kidding me?
- Do I look like I'm kidding you?

419
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,886
Listen, don't you see that my hands
are tied to the steering wheel?

420
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:54,617
I don't care what they're tied to.
I'll fuck you up.

421
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,285
- Don't shoot, man.
- Then get your ass up.

422
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,090
Fuck.

423
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,563
What the fuck else you got in here?
Jackpot.

424
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,906
Thanks, for real. Bop!

425
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,272
Yo, homey.

426
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,012
- That my briefcase?
- This yours?

427
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,351
Yeah, it is.
Why, you want it back?

428
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,923
How about your wallet?

429
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,488
What else you got for me, huh?

430
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,398
Fuck!

431
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,110
Where's the button?
Under the dash?

432
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,320
Mind getting it?

433
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,138
You attract attention, you're going to
get people killed who didn't need to be.

434
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,871
You understand?

435
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:24,140
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

436
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,949
But, hey, new news...

437
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,220
We're ahead of schedule.

438
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,388
- Like jazz?
- Sorry. What?

439
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,728
Jazz. You like jazz?

440
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,857
Not that much.

441
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,769
Guy told me about this place
off Crenshaw.

442
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,773
Leimert Park.
All the West Coast greats played there.

443
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:55,312
Dexter Gordon, Charlie Mingus,
Chet Baker. Like that.

444
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:00,312
Come on, finish up.
I'll buy you a drink.

445
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,487
- [indistinct chatter]
- [helicopter overhead]

446
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,322
What's your informant's name? Ramone?

447
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,730
Ramone Ayala. Supposed to meet him
in Bellflower last night.

448
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,667
He doesn't show up,
I roll here, find this.

449
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:24,070
- How long you been working this guy?
- Four months. He's a low-level player.

450
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:27,269
Part of a distribution network
that hooks up to Felix.

451
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,970
Felix Reyes-Torrena?

452
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,049
Feds are all over him,
don't want us anywhere near it.

453
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,549
Since when's LAPD
working for the Feeb?

454
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,554
They'll just take our stuff,
build their case, take the credit.

455
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,682
- What's the point?
- The point is my guy flew out a window.

456
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:46,286
So if my Cl flies out a window,
he's got Felix's handprints on his ass.

457
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,864
That makes it mine.

458
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:51,594
Is there a crime here? A homicide?
You got a body?

459
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,501
- Just a bunch of broken glass.
- And blood.

460
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:59,042
Down here, in the glass.
Here's some more.

461
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:02,704
And there's some spatter patterns
over there and over here.

462
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,446
- [woman] Richard?
- Yeah, it's me.

463
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,756
Ramone went through that window...
splat.

464
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,759
Glass here, then tires rolled over it.

465
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,026
Maybe he jumped.

466
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:26,194
Sure. He's depressed so he jumps four
stories out of a window onto his head.

467
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,670
"That feels better"
Picks himself up.

468
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,106
"Now I think I'll go on
with the rest of my day"

469
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,200
- Come on, man.
- Hey, Ray!

470
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,677
Catch.

471
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,447
- Recent?
- You can still smell the cordite.

472
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:47,648
Old guy across the alley watching TV
says he saw a cab earlier tonight

473
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:51,956
- with two guys walking around the hood.
- Description? He see anything?

474
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:55,089
Kind of saw. Guy's got glasses
like Coke bottles.

475
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,657
There are 4,000 taxicabs in L.A. County.
You got anything else?

476
00:38:58,769 --> 00:38:59,997
That's it.

477
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,164
Okay. Keep knocking.
Let's keep knocking.

478
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:06,402
Remember that Bay Area deal? Oakland?

479
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,206
Cabby drove around all night,
killed three people,

480
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:12,009
- then put the gun to his head.
- He flipped out. So what?

481
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,346
So that Oakland detective
never bought it.

482
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,444
Cabby had no criminal record
or history of mental illness.

483
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:20,149
Pops three people, then himself?

484
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:25,484
Anyway, that detective always thought
there was someone else in that cab.

485
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,866
[jazz music plays]

486
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,592
I never learned to listen to jazz.

487
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:05,200
It's off melody. Behind the notes.
Not what's expected.

488
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,760
- lmprovising, like tonight.
- Like tonight?

489
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,260
Most people, ten years from now,

490
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,062
same job, place, routine.
Everthhing the same.

491
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:42,868
Just keeping it safe over and over.
Ten years from now.

492
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:46,340
Man, you don't know where you'll be
ten minutes from now.

493
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,076
Do you?

494
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,695
Who is that on the trumpet?

495
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,094
[woman] That's Daniel, baby,
he's the owner.

496
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,963
He's terrific. Would you be so kind
as to invite him over after his set?

497
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,097
- I got to buy him a drink.
- Sure thing, darling.

498
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:28,550
[Daniel] Now see, I was about 1 9,
bussing tables right here.

499
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,553
The money wasn't shit,
but that wasn't the point.

500
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,419
It was about being around the music.
And I was.

501
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:39,360
Take this one night. July 22nd, 1 964.
Who you think walks through that door?

502
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,260
[woman] Bye, baby.

503
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,698
- Miles Davis. That's right.
- In the flesh?

504
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:48,329
I'm talking about through those doors,
the coolest man on the planet.

505
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,736
Jesus.

506
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,300
Anyway, he had been recording a session
up at Columbia, up on Vine.

507
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,538
So Miles comes through that door.

508
00:41:56,647 --> 00:42:00,845
Before you know it, he's up on
the bandstand, jamming with the band.

509
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,646
I mean, it had to be...

510
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:06,712
Oh, it was scary.
I mean, the dude was so focused, man.

511
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,224
Plus, he was kind of
a scary cat anyway.

512
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:13,854
Everybody and their mama knew you don't
just come up and talk to Miles Davis.

513
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:17,422
I mean, he may have looked like
he was chilling, but he was absorbed.

514
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:22,700
This one young, hip couple, one of them
tried to shake his hand one day.

515
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,172
And the guy says,
"Hi, my name is.."

516
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:28,245
Miles said, "Get out of my face,
you jive motheefucker.

517
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,813
Take your silly bitch with you"

518
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,007
[both laugh]

519
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,983
You know? That was Miles, man.

520
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:39,385
That's the way he was when he was
in his musical headspace. Fierce.

521
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,618
- But did you get to talk to him?
- Better than that.

522
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,217
I played for about 20 minutes.

523
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,887
[Vincent] Unbelievable.

524
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,692
- How'd you do?
- How'd I do?

525
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:51,632
You really ain't shit
playing next to Miles Davis.

526
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,225
But he carried my ass.

527
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,066
[Vincent] What'd he say?

528
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,834
He said one word: Cool.

529
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,307
Cool?

530
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,877
- That's it?
- Yeah.

531
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,344
That meant, "Good, but not ready"

532
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,041
It meant, "Look me up when you are"

533
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,549
Did you?

534
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:12,486
No. I got drafted
and got into some other things.

535
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:17,425
And by the time I got back to music,
season had passed.

536
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,090
You know, I was born in 1 945,

537
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:24,964
but that night was the moment
of my conception.

538
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:28,163
- Right here in this room.
- Crowd's not here now.

539
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,571
Well, jazz ain't the draw
that it used to be.

540
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,768
What a great story.

541
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:40,111
I got to tell the people in Culiacan
and Cartagena that story.

542
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,529
You know the folks
in Culiacan and Cartagena?

543
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,193
Afraid so.

544
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:02,094
Just when I thought
you were a cool guy.

545
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:05,664
I am a cool guy with a job
I contracted to do.

546
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:09,143
- Come on, give the dude a pass.
- I'm working here.

547
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,680
You're the one talking
about improvisation.

548
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:14,808
You like the guy, how he plays.
Let's just play a little jazz.

549
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,910
Improvi...
That's funny coming from you.

550
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,551
How's this?

551
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,689
- I'll ask a question.
- [Daniel] What question?

552
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,232
A jazz question.

553
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:34,100
Now, you get it right, we roll.

554
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,570
You disappear tonight.

555
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,699
If I walk out of here tonight,

556
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:42,836
I will go so far away,
it'll be just like I was dead.

557
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:47,440
And one more thing: These people
and their rep here, Felix...

558
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,782
Well, you tell them I'm sorry.

559
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:55,518
You tell them I had to.
They laid a grant of immunity on me.

560
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:58,390
It was either play ball
or go back inside.

561
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:02,056
And I'm not going back inside.

562
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,494
Yeah.

563
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,541
Lay it on me.

564
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:14,008
Where did Miles learn music?

565
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,046
- I know everthhing about Miles.
- Then let's have it.

566
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,810
Music school.
He got into music school, right?

567
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:23,148
His father was a dentist,
east St. Louis.

568
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,813
Invested in agriculture,
made plenty of money.

569
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:31,623
He sent Miles to Juilliard School
of Music, New York, 1 945.

570
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,026
Man.

571
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:51,537
Dropped out in less than a year, tracked
down Charlie Parker on 52nd Street

572
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:54,173
who mentored him
for the next three years.

573
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,902
Hey.

574
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,873
- No, I'm done. Find you another cab.
- Max.

575
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,608
Leave me alone.
I'm collateral, anyway.

576
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:27,980
[grunting]

577
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,013
[Max panting]

578
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,249
I am not playing.

579
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,628
You played him, man.

580
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:42,423
He got the answer right...

581
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,899
...would you have let him go?

582
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:50,370
[Lenny on radio] 102, Max,

583
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,442
What is it with this guy?

584
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,981
- You hassling my driver again?
- Who are you?

585
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,717
The same guy you talked to last time.

586
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,193
Max's mother's driVing me crazy,
Put him on the line, please,

587
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,820
Hang on.

588
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,264
Carefully.

589
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:19,435
Yeah?

590
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,164
Your mother's calling,
"Why didn't you show?

591
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:25,332
- Are you all right? Where are you?"
- [Vincent] Show for what?

592
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,577
T ell her I can't make it tonight.

593
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,909
I'm not related to you,
Tell her yourself,

594
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,914
Show up for what?

595
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,613
She's in the hospital.

596
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,587
- You visit every night?
- Yeah. What's the difference?

597
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,920
- You don't show up, it breaks routine.
- So?

598
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:46,189
So people start looking for you, this cab.
That's not good.

599
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,166
I'm not taking you to see my mother.

600
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,637
Since when was any of this negotiable.

601
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,506
Two paces ahead, one to the left.

602
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,117
Flowers?

603
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,486
It's a waste of money.
Won't mean a thing to her.

604
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:19,154
She carried you in her womb
for nine months.

605
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,059
People buy flowers. Buy flowers.

606
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:27,864
Excuse me.

607
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,871
Keep the change.

608
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,569
[bell rings]

609
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,779
[man] Hold that elevator, please.

610
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,183
- Floor?
- Five. Thanks.

611
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:01,402
- Having a good night?
- Mezzo mezzo,

612
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,302
You?

613
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,613
Excuse me.

614
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:48,510
Hey, Ma.

615
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,615
I've been calling and calling.

616
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,715
- I got caught up at work.
- Why couldn't you call me?

617
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,159
I'm lying here wondering if something
terrible happened to you.

618
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,163
- I brought you flowers.
- What am I gonna do with flowers?

619
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,823
- Cheer up.
- How?

620
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:08,701
By worrying that you spend money
on stuff that's just going to wilt and die?

621
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,202
See what I mean?

622
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,276
I didn't buy you the flowers. He did.

623
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:14,935
Who?

624
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,516
Why didn't you tell me we had company?

625
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:28,023
What's your name?
Sorry my son is rude.

626
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,252
No harm done, ma'am.

627
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,760
You paid for my flowers?

628
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,888
They're beautiful.

629
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,736
Well, Max?

630
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:52,145
Mother, this is Vincent.
Vincent, this is my mother, lda.

631
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,415
I am very happy to meet you,
Mrs. Durocher.

632
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,352
[chuckling] Oh, just call me lda.

633
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,755
Ida. I was with Max
when he got the call.

634
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:07,286
- [lda] You came here to see me?
- [Vincent] It's nothing, ma'am.

635
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,887
Tell my son.

636
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:13,163
You have to hold a gun to his head
to make him do anything.

637
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,501
You must be one of
Max's important clients.

638
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:20,372
Client? You know, I like to think
of myself as his friend.

639
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,803
[lda] Max never had many friends.

640
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,314
Always talking to himself in the mirror.
It's unhealthy.

641
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,384
How many times I got to ask
don't do that?

642
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:29,452
Do what?

643
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,784
Don't talk about me like
I'm not right here in the room here.

644
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,186
What's he saying?

645
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,852
[Vincent] He says he's standing
right here in the room here.

646
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:41,124
Yes, you are.
He's sensitive.

647
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:44,598
I know. But I'm sure
you're very proud of him.

648
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:48,660
Of course I'm proud.
He started with nothing, you know?

649
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,865
Look at him today.
Here, Vegas...

650
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:55,104
Mom, he is not interested in hearing
about all that, okay?

651
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:58,909
I came to see you, I saw you,
you look good, let's go.

652
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,040
I am very interested, lda. Please.

653
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:04,120
- Limousine companies.
- Is that right?

654
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,348
He drives famous people around.

655
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,788
Famous people. Limousine companies.

656
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:11,417
Now, that's quite an achievement.

657
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:15,862
- [lda] What did you say your name was?
- My name's Vincent, ma'am.

658
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,126
Visit again?

659
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,327
[Vincent] No, I'm just in town tonight.

660
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:22,530
- [lda] When you come back.
- [Vincent] Sure.

661
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,623
Max!

662
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:26,296
Don't!

663
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,264
[Max screams]

664
00:53:55,365 --> 00:54:00,132
All my prep was in there.
You are screwing with my work.

665
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,263
[ragged breathing]

666
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,942
Let's see what else you can do.

667
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:08,670
[Max groans]

668
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:14,583
Well, I've had four come in tonight.
Maybe one's your guy.

669
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,692
No, not Ramone. Let's see this one.

670
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:28,956
No, next.

671
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:32,228
There's something funny
about this, though.

672
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:36,499
These three all came in within
half an hour of each other, right?

673
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,631
The kid and that last guy,

674
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,575
both done by the same shooter, I think.

675
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:43,646
Why do you say that?

676
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:46,113
Wound pattern.

677
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,776
Two in the sternum, one in the head.

678
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:52,321
This guy is shooting tight groups too,
all right? Check this out.

679
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:55,914
Double taps are
a couple millimeters apart.

680
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,994
Let's see this one.

681
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:08,304
See what I mean?

682
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:11,772
Holy shit.

683
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,775
Can I use your phone?

684
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:22,214
Come on, come on, wake up.

685
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:27,788
[ringing]

686
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:37,930
Hello.

687
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:41,629
It's Fanning. I'm still down here
at the morgue at Sisters of Charity.

688
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:45,401
John Does didn't pan out, but you'll
never guess who's in the meat locker.

689
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,475
Who?

690
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:50,137
Sylvester Clarke, criminal attorney
turned lawyer criminal.

691
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:55,684
[Fanning] Including Ramone,
who he represented, who's still missing,

692
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:58,583
Both are in
the exotic substances business together.

693
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:02,784
There's something going on,
and I don't think the feds know about it.

694
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:05,918
Stay on your cell phone.
I got the ASAC's phone.

695
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,190
I'll hook up with you in 30 minutes.

696
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,424
Good.

697
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:19,674
Going to a place called El Rodeo.
It's on Washington Boulevard, Pico Rivera.

698
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:22,870
- Where at on Washington?
- Look it up.

699
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,007
Limos, huh?

700
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,144
Don't start.

701
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:33,916
I'm not the one lying to my mother.

702
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:36,958
She hears what she wants to hear.
I don't disillusion her.

703
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,153
Right. Maybe she hears
what you tell her.

704
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:42,754
Whatever I tell her's never good enough.
It's always been that way.

705
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,167
So, what's at El Rodeo?

706
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:47,896
Just drive.

707
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,832
They project onto you their flaws.

708
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:55,308
What they don't like about themselves,
their lives, whatever.

709
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,744
They rank on you instead.

710
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,208
How do you know?

711
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:02,181
I had a father like that.

712
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,244
- Mothers are worse.
- Wouldn't know.

713
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,448
My mother died
before I remember her.

714
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:09,525
What happened to your father?

715
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,191
Hated everthhing I did.

716
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:17,926
Got drunk, beat me up, foster homes.
Went back with him. Like that.

717
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,371
Then what?

718
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,238
I killed him.

719
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:30,443
I was 1 2.

720
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:37,013
[laughing]

721
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,951
I'm kidding.

722
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:44,556
He died of liver disease.

723
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:48,721
Well, I'm sorry.

724
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,595
No, you're not.

725
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:09,249
So, what is this "driving a cab temporarily"
It's all bullshit?

726
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:11,582
It is not bullshit.

727
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,451
[Vincent] 1 2 years isn't temporary.

728
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:17,253
Got to get the cash together.
Insurance, bonds, maintenance, tires.

729
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,555
Got to staff up,
get the right client list.

730
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,324
It's not just get the car
and put asses in the seats.

731
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:23,399
Why not?

732
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,061
Because lsland Limos
is more than just a ride.

733
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,470
It's like a club experience.
Cool groove.

734
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,542
Don't want it to end.

735
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,270
It's got to be peefect.

736
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:37,870
Peefect.

737
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,616
It's up here. Turn right.

738
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:01,204
Give me your wallet. Come on.

739
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,229
Give me your wallet. Come on.

740
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,637
Give you my wallet. For what?

741
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:09,644
I'll hold it for you
in case the people inside search you.

742
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:12,442
- Who's searching?
- The people inside.

743
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,245
Go in, ask for Felix.
He's expecting you.

744
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:19,048
- Felix. What does he look like?
- I don't know, I never met him.

745
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:20,588
Who is he?

746
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,954
He's connected to the guys
who hired me.

747
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,026
I don't get it.

748
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:26,391
You destroyed my work-ups.
Number four is due.

749
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,488
What'd you think, night's over?
Called on account of rain?

750
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,897
Go in there, say you're me.
Score the backups.

751
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:34,799
- They'll be on flash drive or CD.
- How come you don't...

752
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,566
I don't meet people. Anonymity.
I protect mine.

753
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,973
You're not going to screw that up.
Contract's with their bosses.

754
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:44,376
These guys don't meet me,
or know what I look like.

755
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:49,075
If I don't pull it off, then...

756
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:51,676
They will kill you.
You got 1 0 minutes.

757
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:55,383
At 1 0:01, I execute your mother
on my way out of town.

758
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:58,324
- Don't pretend indifference.
- I can't do this.

759
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:02,330
- I can't.
- Sure you can. Come on. Hey, hey.

760
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,799
If I do this, I'm just going to end up
getting people killed.

761
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:09,269
Out of options. Take comfort in knowing
you never had a choice.

762
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:13,867
- How long you been doing this?
- Why?

763
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,774
Just in case they ask me.

764
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:20,305
- Private sector? Six years.
- Okay. All right. Six years.

765
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:25,046
You get benefits?
Or, you know, insurance? Pension?

766
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:28,055
No. No paid sick leave.
Quit stalling, get out of the cab.

01:01:13,366 --> 01:01:14,799
Mark the time.

772

All right, he's clean.

773
01:01:25,979 --> 01:01:28,539
What's up, Holmes?

774
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:33,347
I'm here to see Felix.
He has something for me.

775
01:01:33,453 --> 01:01:35,318
Don't know no Felix.

776
01:01:40,127 --> 01:01:41,094
Tell him...

777

- OK, how are you? Agent Frank Pedrosa.

786
01:02:46,827 --> 01:02:49,091
- Thanks for seeing us.
- How can I help?

787
01:02:49,196 --> 01:02:51,460
Why do you want to know
about our case?

788
01:02:51,565 --> 01:02:54,329
- Any unusual activity tonight?
- Like what?

789
01:02:54,434 --> 01:02:58,700
That relates to a series of murders
in Wilshire Central or West Hollywood?

790
01:02:59,739 --> 01:03:01,969
All quiet on the western front.

791

Various people are asleep.
Various people are not.

792

They come and go in cars,
pickups, taxis.

Other than that, we watch air move.

794

- Your interest in our case?
- We got a situation. Two bodies.

795
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:19,184
Could be a coincidence,
could not be a coincidence.

796
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:22,352
It doesn't look like one.
We got an attorney and his client...

But he don't meet you. OK.

I want you to listen to me real well.

17
01:05:47,273 --> 01:05:49,969
Special groups put together
the list of dedos.

- Dedos.
- Fingers. Informants.

worked up that list.

And you lost it?

01:06:12,766 --> 01:06:15,860
Yeah. I'm sorry.

24
01:06:17,303 --> 01:06:18,361
Sorry.

25
01:06:19,572 --> 01:06:24,600
Sorry? "Sorry" does not put
Humpty Dumpty back together again.

- Do you believe in Humpty Dumpty?
- No.

Nor do l, but my children do.
They are still small.

But do you know who they like even
better than Santa Claus? His helper.

31
01:06:43,763 --> 01:06:46,789
Pedro el Negro. Black Peter.

32
01:06:48,168 --> 01:06:52,537
There's an old Mexican tale
that tells of how Santa Claus

33
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:55,107
got so busy looking out
for the good children,

34
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:58,769
that he had to hire some help
to look out for the bad children.

35
01:06:58,878 --> 01:07:00,971
So he hired Pedro.

36
01:07:01,081 --> 01:07:06,519
And Santa Claus gave him a list
with all the names of all the bad children.

37
01:07:06,619 --> 01:07:09,452
And Pedro would come every night
to check them out.

38
01:07:09,556 --> 01:07:12,650
And the people, the little kids
that were misbehaving,

39
01:07:12,759 --> 01:07:15,125
that were not saying their prayers,

40
01:07:15,228 --> 01:07:19,324
Pedro would leave a little
toy donkey on their windows.

41
01:07:19,432 --> 01:07:23,630
A little burro,
and he would come back.

42
01:07:23,736 --> 01:07:26,830
If they were still misbehaving,
Pedro would take them away

43
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,965
and nobody would ever see them again.

44
01:07:29,075 --> 01:07:34,342
Now, if I am being Santa Claus,
and you are Pedro,

45
01:07:34,447 --> 01:07:37,746
how do you think
jolly old Santa Claus would feel

46
01:07:37,851 --> 01:07:41,981
if one day Pedro came into his office
and said, "l lost the list"?

47
01:07:42,088 --> 01:07:45,057
How fucking furious
do you think he will get?

48
01:07:45,925 --> 01:07:47,483
Tell me, Vincent.

49
01:07:48,194 --> 01:07:50,492
Tell me what you think.

50
01:07:51,764 --> 01:07:54,392
- [clears throat]
- What?

51
01:07:57,203 --> 01:07:59,034
I think...

52
01:08:02,008 --> 01:08:04,841
I think you should tell the guy...

53
01:08:04,944 --> 01:08:06,775
behind me...

54
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,041
...to put that gun down.

55
01:08:09,949 --> 01:08:11,974
What did you say?

56
01:08:12,085 --> 01:08:15,111
I said you should tell the guy
behind me to put his gun away

57
01:08:15,221 --> 01:08:18,657
before I take it and beat
his bitch ass to death with it.

58
01:08:29,302 --> 01:08:30,599
I picked up a tail.

59
01:08:30,703 --> 01:08:33,797
- Federal?
- I don't know, you tell me.

60
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:37,869
That's why I tossed the list.

61
01:08:38,511 --> 01:08:41,002
The work-ups, all of that shit.

62
01:08:41,114 --> 01:08:43,548
To protect, in part...

63
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:48,678
your Hermes Faconnable ass.

64
01:08:53,793 --> 01:08:56,091
You think I like coming in here?

65
01:08:58,064 --> 01:09:00,089
But, hey...

66
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,100
...shit happens.

67
01:09:02,202 --> 01:09:05,000
Got to roll with it. Adapt.

68
01:09:05,104 --> 01:09:07,902
Darwin. I Ching.

69
01:09:10,476 --> 01:09:13,377
The fat man, the penthouse guy,
the jazz man.

70
01:09:15,048 --> 01:09:16,845
That leaves two.

71
01:09:25,825 --> 01:09:27,452
Can you finish?

72
01:09:28,728 --> 01:09:30,161
In six years...

73
01:09:33,099 --> 01:09:35,192
...when have I not?

74
01:09:35,301 --> 01:09:37,394
[Max, distorted] Say it's Vincent.

75
01:09:37,503 --> 01:09:39,061
I'm Vincent.

76
01:09:39,172 --> 01:09:41,470
- [rewinding]
- Say it's Vincent.

77
01:09:42,242 --> 01:09:43,732
I'm Vincent.

78
01:09:43,843 --> 01:09:45,902
Say it's Vincent.

79
01:09:46,946 --> 01:09:48,106
I'm Vincent.

80
01:09:49,515 --> 01:09:52,382
- [Weidner] Vincent?
- [woman] That's what I'm hearing.

81
01:09:52,485 --> 01:09:53,782
[Max] I'm Vincent.

82
01:10:16,743 --> 01:10:18,472
Your last two.

83
01:10:21,948 --> 01:10:25,850
And by the way,
as a token of my appreciation

84
01:10:25,952 --> 01:10:27,977
I would like to offer you a discount.

85
01:10:30,623 --> 01:10:33,057
For all my services, 25 percent.

86
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:35,286
Very generous.

87
01:10:35,395 --> 01:10:36,885
Hell, make it 35.

88
01:10:38,765 --> 01:10:40,756
And by the way...

89
01:10:43,503 --> 01:10:45,334
Daniel said he was sorry.

90
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:51,777
Interesting.

91
01:10:51,878 --> 01:10:53,778
[mumbles in Spanish]

92
01:11:19,272 --> 01:11:21,365
[crowd chatters, indistinct]

93
01:11:31,751 --> 01:11:33,150
E-mail me his license.

94
01:11:33,252 --> 01:11:35,482
[Fanning] To my cell phone.

95
01:11:35,588 --> 01:11:37,112
No, no, I'll wait.

96
01:11:37,223 --> 01:11:39,987
Is there anybody else in that cab?

97
01:11:56,476 --> 01:12:00,105
[Vincent] Vegas odds would've been
against you walking out of there.

98
01:12:00,213 --> 01:12:01,578
Yeah, I'm very impressive.

99
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:08,687
Sixth Street by Alexandria,
a club called Fever. You know it?

100
01:12:18,931 --> 01:12:22,094
Locate our witness, Peter Lim.
Get him evacuated and safe.

101
01:12:22,201 --> 01:12:24,533
[Pedrosa] L.A. 1 01 to chase units.

102
01:12:24,637 --> 01:12:26,434
African American, medium build.

103
01:12:26,539 --> 01:12:30,339
The assault team will do the takedown.
Do not spook him before.

104
01:12:30,443 --> 01:12:32,673
I want air support
to maintain at 1 500 feet.

105
01:12:32,779 --> 01:12:33,905
Thank you.

106
01:12:39,118 --> 01:12:42,110
- How long?
- 1 2 minutes.

107
01:12:42,221 --> 01:12:46,351
According to the cab's dispatch unit,
he's been driving that cab for 1 2 years.

108
01:12:46,459 --> 01:12:47,426
So what?

109
01:12:47,527 --> 01:12:50,018
You're telling me the guy
walks into a phone booth

110
01:12:50,129 --> 01:12:53,394
and changes into a meat-eater
super assassin?

111
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:56,059
What's he do,
squeeze them in between fares?

112
01:12:56,169 --> 01:12:58,535
The real driver is floating down
a storm drain.

113
01:12:58,638 --> 01:13:01,004
[Fanning] The guy who walked out
looks like this.

114
01:13:01,107 --> 01:13:03,769
- He picked a driver who looks like him.
- I don't know.

115
01:13:03,876 --> 01:13:06,071
I do. Zee?

116
01:13:06,179 --> 01:13:09,615
We see private-sector security companies
hiring out to cartels

117
01:13:09,715 --> 01:13:11,546
in Colombia, Russia, Mexico,

118
01:13:11,651 --> 01:13:16,179
hiring ex-Special Forces, Stasi,
ex-KGB, like that, all the time.

119
01:13:16,289 --> 01:13:20,385
Guys with trigger time, skill sets,
tradecraft, look like a cab driver.

120
01:13:20,493 --> 01:13:22,324
What are you going to do?

121
01:13:22,428 --> 01:13:25,556
Take his ass down.
Save our witness.

122
01:13:30,937 --> 01:13:32,404
What if they're wrong?

123
01:13:32,505 --> 01:13:36,737
The guy's admitting his name is Vincent.
He's in there talking to the bad guys.

124
01:13:36,843 --> 01:13:39,903
- There is something else going on.
- There's nothing.

125
01:13:40,012 --> 01:13:43,311
I thought there was, there isn't.
It's their ball, their game.

126
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:46,146
- There's nothing in it for us.
- Nothing for you.

127
01:13:46,252 --> 01:13:49,415
It's late, I'm going home.
You know what time it is?

128
01:13:54,293 --> 01:13:56,193
[tires screeching]

129
01:14:41,307 --> 01:14:42,604
They locate Peter Lim?

130
01:14:49,081 --> 01:14:53,245
- [Zee] The wife thinks he's at Fever.
- [Pedrosa] Sixth and Alexandria. Move it.

131
01:14:53,352 --> 01:14:57,049
L.A. 1 01 to L.A. 1 03,
L.A. 1 05, L.A. 1 08.

132
01:14:57,156 --> 01:15:01,149
Witness is at Fever, Sixth and Alexandria.
That's where Vincent is going.

133
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:04,229
[Pedrosa] Assault team
and remaining unit, take Vincent.

134
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:06,764
First unit on the scene
will get the witness out.

135
01:15:06,866 --> 01:15:10,495
L.A. 1 05 to L.A. 1 01.
We copy that.

136
01:15:45,338 --> 01:15:47,636
- You going to call her?
- Who?

137
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:51,506
Your lady friend.
The one who gave you her business card.

138
01:15:51,611 --> 01:15:54,705
I don't know. Maybe, maybe not.

139
01:15:54,814 --> 01:15:55,781
What?

140
01:15:56,816 --> 01:15:58,784
Pick up the phone.

141
01:15:59,485 --> 01:16:02,511
Life's short. One day it's gone.

142
01:16:07,493 --> 01:16:10,690
You and I make it out of this alive,
you should call her.

143
01:16:11,731 --> 01:16:13,699
That's what I think.

144
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:17,328
Anyway...

145
01:18:00,072 --> 01:18:02,040
[Pedrosa] There he is. Hit it.

146
01:18:33,672 --> 01:18:35,469
[Pedrosa] Let's do it.

147
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:42,480
[throbbing club music plays]

148
01:18:43,549 --> 01:18:46,882
[Vincent] The table towards the back
is where he hangs.

149
01:18:59,265 --> 01:19:02,826
Wilke, take the right.
Brian, hold the door.

150
01:19:02,935 --> 01:19:05,460
Clean shots.
Watch your backgrounds.

151
01:20:02,294 --> 01:20:04,194
Move 1 5 feet ahead, three feet left.

152
01:20:04,296 --> 01:20:07,823
Wander, innocent bystanders
get the first rounds. Clear?

153
01:21:01,687 --> 01:21:04,588
- [grunting]
- [snapping]

154
01:21:24,043 --> 01:21:26,068
- [crunching]
- [screaming]

155
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,510
[pained groaning]

156
01:21:49,168 --> 01:21:51,864
There's Lim. Second booth from the left.
Get him out.

157
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,770
[clubbers chattering]

158
01:22:02,781 --> 01:22:05,443
Middle of the dance floor.
Freeze, Vincent!

159
01:22:05,551 --> 01:22:09,385
FBl! FBl! Get your hands in the air!
Get your hands in the air, Vincent!

160
01:22:09,488 --> 01:22:12,924
- This is the FBl! Hands in the air!
- FBl. Where's Peter Lim?

161
01:22:13,025 --> 01:22:16,017
- [shouting in Korean]
- Drop it!

162
01:22:16,128 --> 01:22:18,028
[screaming]

163
01:22:19,098 --> 01:22:20,998
Freeze!

164
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,364
- I'm not Vincent.
- FBl!

165
01:22:23,469 --> 01:22:25,994
Yo, put the gun down!
You got the wrong...

166
01:22:32,277 --> 01:22:34,677
[screaming]

167
01:22:57,603 --> 01:22:59,901
Pedrosa's been shot.
Get an RA unit.

168
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:19,616
Wait, wait!

169
01:23:52,124 --> 01:23:54,285
Hold on. I'm Detective Fanning.

170
01:23:54,393 --> 01:23:57,624
I'm Max! I'm a goddamn cab driver, man!
I'm a goddamn cab driver.

171
01:23:57,729 --> 01:24:00,630
I know. I'm getting you out of here.
I'm LAPD. Come on.

172
01:24:03,769 --> 01:24:05,396
[shouting in Korean]

173
01:24:39,204 --> 01:24:41,672
- How'd you find me?
- You're okay. Just move it.

174
01:24:41,773 --> 01:24:43,070
Keep moving.

175
01:24:55,287 --> 01:24:57,187
[Fanning] You're OK, you're OK.

176
01:24:57,689 --> 01:24:59,919
You're OK. You're all right.

177
01:25:07,699 --> 01:25:09,690
- [shots, crowd screams]
- Let's go!

178
01:25:09,801 --> 01:25:11,666
[car alarm sounding]

179
01:25:13,105 --> 01:25:14,800
Let's go.

180
01:25:23,115 --> 01:25:24,810
Go! Drive! Drive!

181
01:25:26,919 --> 01:25:29,683
[metal, glass crunching]

182
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:36,687
[chopper buzzing]

183
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:02,150
[sirens]

184
01:26:02,688 --> 01:26:05,657
Only thing didn't show up
was the Polish cavalry.

185
01:26:07,059 --> 01:26:09,857
You're alive. I saved you.

186
01:26:12,831 --> 01:26:16,858
Do I get any thanks?
No. All you can do is clam up.

187
01:26:19,571 --> 01:26:22,165
You want to talk?
Tell me to fuck off?

188
01:26:22,274 --> 01:26:23,571
Fuck off.

189
01:26:26,845 --> 01:26:28,540
You had to kill Fanning?

190
01:26:28,647 --> 01:26:31,548
- Who the fuck is Fanning?
- Fanning, the cop.

191
01:26:33,318 --> 01:26:35,149
Why'd you have to kill him?

192
01:26:35,254 --> 01:26:38,553
He's probably got a family.
Kids will grow up without him.

193
01:26:38,657 --> 01:26:40,557
He believed me.

194
01:26:40,659 --> 01:26:43,287
I should've saved him
because he believed you.

195
01:26:43,395 --> 01:26:44,862
- Not that.
- Yeah. That.

196
01:26:44,963 --> 01:26:46,521
What's wrong with that?

197
01:26:46,632 --> 01:26:48,827
- It's what I do for a living.
- Some living.

198
01:26:48,934 --> 01:26:51,129
- Head downtown.
- What's downtown?

199
01:26:51,236 --> 01:26:55,070
How are you at math?
I was hired for five hits. I did four.

200
01:26:57,009 --> 01:26:59,842
Why didn't you just kill me
and get another cab driver?

201
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:06,010
You're good. We're in this together.
Fates intertwined. Cosmic coincidence.

202
01:27:06,118 --> 01:27:08,177
- You full of shit.
- I'm full of shit?

203
01:27:08,287 --> 01:27:10,152
You even bullshitted yourself,

204
01:27:10,255 --> 01:27:12,917
if all I am is taking out garbage,
killing bad people.

205
01:27:13,025 --> 01:27:15,585
- That's what you said.
- You believe me?

206
01:27:15,694 --> 01:27:17,321
[exasperated sigh]

207
01:27:17,429 --> 01:27:20,421
- Then what'd they do?
- How do I know?

208
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:25,128
They all got that
"witness for the prosecution" look to me.

209
01:27:25,237 --> 01:27:27,262
Probably some major federal indictment

210
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:30,136
of somebody who majorly
does not want to get indicted.

211
01:27:30,242 --> 01:27:32,472
So that's the reason?

212
01:27:33,512 --> 01:27:35,605
That's the "why."
There's no reason.

213
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:38,410
There's no good or bad reason
to live or to die.

214
01:27:39,451 --> 01:27:41,078
Then what are you?

215
01:27:41,186 --> 01:27:42,949
Indifferent.

216
01:27:45,757 --> 01:27:47,224
Get with it.

217
01:27:47,326 --> 01:27:50,090
Millions of galaxies
of hundreds of millions of stars

218
01:27:50,195 --> 01:27:52,595
and a speck on one in a blink.

219
01:27:52,698 --> 01:27:54,325
That's us. Lost in space.

220
01:27:54,433 --> 01:27:56,663
The cop, you, me...

221
01:27:57,703 --> 01:28:00,103
Who notices?

222
01:28:08,313 --> 01:28:09,871
What's with you?

223
01:28:11,516 --> 01:28:12,483
As in?

224
01:28:13,352 --> 01:28:15,752
As in if somebody had
a gun to your head and said:

225
01:28:15,854 --> 01:28:20,154
"You got to tell me what's going on
with this person over here or I'll kill you.

226
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,396
What is driving him?
What was he thinking?"

227
01:28:25,497 --> 01:28:28,193
You know, you couldn't do it,
could you, because...

228
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,097
...they'd have to kill your ass

229
01:28:30,202 --> 01:28:34,161
because you don't know
what anyone else is thinking.

230
01:28:35,173 --> 01:28:37,971
I think you're low, my brother.
Way low.

231
01:28:39,745 --> 01:28:43,704
Like, what were you? One of those
institutionalized raised guys?

232
01:28:43,815 --> 01:28:45,806
Anybody home?

233
01:28:45,917 --> 01:28:51,082
The standard parts that are supposed
to be there in people, in you...

234
01:28:51,857 --> 01:28:53,324
...aren't.

235
01:28:57,863 --> 01:28:59,956
And why haven't you killed me yet?

236
01:29:03,735 --> 01:29:07,899
Of all the cabbies in L.A. I get Max:
Sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth.

237
01:29:08,874 --> 01:29:10,739
Answer the question.

238
01:29:12,778 --> 01:29:14,905
Look in the mirror.

239
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:18,548
Paper towels, clean cab,
limo company someday.

240
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:21,778
- How much you got saved?
- That ain't none of your business.

241
01:29:21,887 --> 01:29:25,118
Someday? Someday my dream will come?

242
01:29:25,223 --> 01:29:28,522
One night you'll wake up and you'll
discover it never happened.

243
01:29:28,627 --> 01:29:32,461
It's all turned around on you.
It never will. Suddenly you are old.

244
01:29:34,699 --> 01:29:38,897
Didn't happen. And it never will because
you were never going to do it anyway.

245
01:29:39,004 --> 01:29:42,337
You'll push it into memory,
then zone out in your Barcalounger,

246
01:29:42,441 --> 01:29:46,673
being hypnotized by daytime TV
for the rest of your life.

247
01:29:46,778 --> 01:29:48,746
Don't you talk to me about murder.

248
01:29:48,847 --> 01:29:53,011
All it ever took was a down payment
on a Lincoln Town Car.

249
01:29:53,118 --> 01:29:55,609
Or that girl.
You can't even call that girl.

250
01:29:56,655 --> 01:29:59,988
What the fuck are you still doing
driving a cab?

251
01:30:18,276 --> 01:30:21,439
Because I never straightened up
and looked at it, you know?

252
01:30:21,546 --> 01:30:23,343
Myself. I should have.

253
01:30:26,551 --> 01:30:31,147
I tried to gamble my way out from under,
but that was just a born-to-lose deal.

254
01:30:31,256 --> 01:30:33,281
- Slow down.
- It's got to be perfect.

255
01:30:33,391 --> 01:30:37,088
It's got to be perfect to go.
Risk all torqued down.

256
01:30:38,263 --> 01:30:40,561
I could've done it
anytime I wanted to.

257
01:30:42,067 --> 01:30:43,193
Red light.

258
01:30:50,475 --> 01:30:52,705
But you know what? New news.

259
01:30:52,811 --> 01:30:55,780
It doesn't matter anyway.
What does it matter anyway?

260
01:30:55,881 --> 01:30:59,840
We're all insignificant out here
in this big-ass nowhere.

261
01:30:59,951 --> 01:31:01,976
Twilight Zone shit.

262
01:31:07,225 --> 01:31:09,352
Says the badass sociopath
in my back seat.

263
01:31:14,132 --> 01:31:17,329
But you know what? That's the one thing
I got to thank you for, bro.

264
01:31:17,435 --> 01:31:19,903
Because until now,
I never looked at it that way.

265
01:31:23,074 --> 01:31:25,941
What does it matter?
It don't, so fuck it. Fix it.

266
01:31:27,445 --> 01:31:30,175
What do we got to lose anyway, right?

267
01:31:30,282 --> 01:31:31,408
Slow down.

268
01:31:31,516 --> 01:31:33,882
Why? You going to pull the trigger
and kill us?

269
01:31:33,985 --> 01:31:36,215
- Go ahead, shoot my ass.
- Slow the hell down.

270
01:31:36,321 --> 01:31:39,222
You going to shoot me now?
You going to kill us?

271
01:31:39,324 --> 01:31:41,918
Well, shoot my ass then.
Shoot me.

272
01:31:42,027 --> 01:31:43,756
- Slow down!
- You're right.

273
01:31:45,196 --> 01:31:46,959
You know what, Vincent?

274
01:31:47,966 --> 01:31:49,558
Go fuck yourself!

275
01:32:03,381 --> 01:32:05,872
- [coughing]
- [car hissing]

276
01:32:22,067 --> 01:32:23,728
Well, that was brilliant.

277
01:32:23,835 --> 01:32:26,326
[Max] Didn't have your seat belt on?

278
01:32:39,017 --> 01:32:41,281
[distant police sirens]

279
01:32:47,726 --> 01:32:50,593
[sirens]

280
01:33:04,275 --> 01:33:08,507
1 L-20, show me code six at Olympic
and Figueroa on a TC with injuries.

281
01:33:08,613 --> 01:33:10,103
[radio] Copy your location.

282
01:33:10,215 --> 01:33:12,945
Are you okay? What happened?

283
01:33:13,985 --> 01:33:16,351
Sir, you were involved in an accident.

284
01:33:16,454 --> 01:33:20,151
An ambulance is on its way to help you.
You understand what I'm saying?

285
01:33:20,258 --> 01:33:21,987
Sit down and relax, okay?

286
01:33:24,562 --> 01:33:28,521
Okay. Don't worry about the cab.
They'll get you a new one.

287
01:33:30,235 --> 01:33:32,294
Relax and breathe.

288
01:33:46,451 --> 01:33:47,816
Put your hands up!

289
01:33:47,919 --> 01:33:51,616
Put your hands up. Face the cab.
Get down on your knees!

290
01:33:51,723 --> 01:33:53,452
- Arrest me.
- Hands on your head.

291
01:33:53,558 --> 01:33:55,526
Take me to jail.
L.A. County's great.

292
01:33:55,627 --> 01:33:58,721
Don't move!
Put your hands behind your head.

293
01:34:03,802 --> 01:34:06,965
[officer] 1 L-20, I need a backup
on a 1 87 suspect.

294
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,072
Ah!

295
01:34:19,751 --> 01:34:21,378
[officer] Put the gun down!

296
01:34:21,486 --> 01:34:24,011
- Put your hands down! Look, I got to go.
- [yelling]

297
01:34:24,122 --> 01:34:26,556
Stop moving! Stop moving!

298
01:34:26,658 --> 01:34:28,751
When did this become a negotiation?

299
01:34:30,795 --> 01:34:33,525
Cuff your hands together.
Hold your hands together.

300
01:34:33,631 --> 01:34:36,896
Listen, somebody's going to get killed
if I don't go right now.

301
01:34:37,001 --> 01:34:39,094
Now, cuff yourself.

302
01:34:39,204 --> 01:34:42,173
I'm going to Sixth and Fig.
Call the cops.

303
01:34:59,357 --> 01:35:00,756
Give me that.

304
01:35:00,859 --> 01:35:03,794
Hey, hey! Whoa! Fuck.

305
01:35:23,915 --> 01:35:25,906
[ringing]

306
01:35:26,951 --> 01:35:29,784
- [beeping]
- Shit!

307
01:35:30,555 --> 01:35:31,954
Come on!

308
01:36:01,553 --> 01:36:04,044
Come on. Go through.

309
01:36:05,490 --> 01:36:08,516
- Come on. Come on. Pick up.
- [ringing]

310
01:36:19,737 --> 01:36:22,365
[ringing]

311
01:36:26,711 --> 01:36:27,837
[Max] Pick up.

312
01:36:29,914 --> 01:36:30,938
Come on, girl.

313
01:36:32,650 --> 01:36:33,947
Come on, pick up.

314
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:54,135
[ringing]

315
01:36:58,142 --> 01:37:01,134
- U.S. Attorney's Office.
- Annie! It's Max.

316
01:37:01,246 --> 01:37:03,214
Max, the cab driver.

317
01:37:03,314 --> 01:37:06,442
Listen to me, all right?
A guy named Vincent...

318
01:37:06,551 --> 01:37:08,348
Listen to me, Annie.

319
01:37:09,354 --> 01:37:11,481
It's kind of a strange time
to be calling.

320
01:37:11,589 --> 01:37:15,855
Listen. There's a man named Vincent.
He's coming to kill you.

321
01:37:17,161 --> 01:37:20,153
- He's what?
- Kill you! He's coming to kill you!

322
01:37:20,265 --> 01:37:23,132
He was scoping out the building
when I dropped you off...

323
01:37:23,234 --> 01:37:27,000
If this is supposed to be
some type of joke, it's not funny.

324
01:37:27,105 --> 01:37:29,335
It's not a joke.
Listen to me, please.

325
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:33,536
Felix hired him. Okay?
Or people that Felix worked for.

326
01:37:33,645 --> 01:37:36,546
Felix Reyes-Torrena.
How do you know about my case?

327
01:37:36,648 --> 01:37:38,138
I don't understand.

328
01:37:38,249 --> 01:37:41,741
All I know is he's already killed witnesses.
He's coming to kill you.

329
01:37:41,853 --> 01:37:44,686
When I dropped you off,
I don't know how,

330
01:37:44,789 --> 01:37:46,950
but he ended up in my cab.

331
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:04,440
[breathing heavily]

332
01:38:06,544 --> 01:38:07,875
[Max] Annie...

333
01:38:07,979 --> 01:38:10,812
Annie, listen.
All I want you to do...

334
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:22,648
- [Annie] I don't understand.
- [Max] Listen. Please listen.

335
01:38:44,716 --> 01:38:47,480
[Max] Get out of the building. Annie.

336
01:38:51,723 --> 01:38:54,283
- [Annie] I'm leaving the building now.
- No, wait.

337
01:38:54,993 --> 01:38:57,154
- Max.
- Wait, wait.

338
01:38:59,063 --> 01:39:01,759
- Max.
- Where are you? What floor?

339
01:39:01,866 --> 01:39:04,664
I'm on the 1 6th floor.
I'm in the Law Library and Files.

340
01:39:05,503 --> 01:39:07,801
He's two floors below you,
corner office.

341
01:39:07,905 --> 01:39:09,202
In my office?

342
01:39:09,307 --> 01:39:12,208
He does not know you're there.
Stay there and call 91 1.

343
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:14,210
Are you sure he's on the 1 4th floor?

344
01:39:14,312 --> 01:39:16,780
Just stay there
and just call the police.

345
01:39:18,049 --> 01:39:19,778
Max.

346
01:39:22,153 --> 01:39:24,087
- [beeping]
- Shit.

347
01:39:31,129 --> 01:39:33,461
Max.

348
01:39:38,870 --> 01:39:41,168
Shit.

349
01:39:43,841 --> 01:39:45,968
[ringing]

350
01:39:46,077 --> 01:39:48,705
- Max.
- He knows you're up there.

351
01:39:48,813 --> 01:39:51,179
I can't hear you. Hello?

352
01:39:51,282 --> 01:39:53,512
Annie. Annie, listen to me.

353
01:39:58,456 --> 01:39:59,821
Annie. Annie.

354
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:03,693
Shit.

355
01:40:59,984 --> 01:41:01,451
[woman] 91 1. Operator.

356
01:41:01,552 --> 01:41:04,043
There is a man in my building
and he is...

357
01:41:04,655 --> 01:41:07,283
[electric fizzling, popping]

358
01:41:08,759 --> 01:41:10,522
[Annie] Hello?

359
01:41:53,704 --> 01:41:55,171
[labored breathing]

360
01:41:57,742 --> 01:41:59,369
[grunting]

361
01:42:07,518 --> 01:42:08,985
[clicking]

362
01:43:08,512 --> 01:43:11,640
[beeping]

363
01:44:14,045 --> 01:44:15,979
[whimpering]

364
01:44:18,783 --> 01:44:20,478
Let her go.

365
01:44:21,052 --> 01:44:22,349
Max?

366
01:44:24,555 --> 01:44:26,523
Why? What are you going to do about it?

367
01:44:26,757 --> 01:44:28,657
- [gunshot]
- [screams]

368
01:44:30,895 --> 01:44:32,624
Come on.

369
01:44:45,976 --> 01:44:48,137
Max!

370
01:45:06,597 --> 01:45:09,157
God. Felix Reyes-Torrena?

371
01:45:09,266 --> 01:45:10,961
Yeah. I met him.

372
01:45:11,068 --> 01:45:13,036
What do you mean, you met him? How?

373
01:45:13,137 --> 01:45:16,436
I don't know. Look, when
I dropped you off, there was a fare.

374
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:18,701
He said his name is Vincent.

375
01:45:25,583 --> 01:45:28,677
- Wait, wait, wait.
- This is the street.

376
01:45:29,754 --> 01:45:32,018
This way. Come on.

377
01:46:00,451 --> 01:46:02,885
[Max] Stay up. Stay up. Stay up.

378
01:46:02,987 --> 01:46:05,046
- What we going to do?
- Wait, wait.

379
01:46:30,681 --> 01:46:31,875
Wait, wait. Wait.

380
01:46:55,172 --> 01:46:57,265
[Max, whispering] Stay down.

381
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:05,610
[train whistling]

382
01:47:45,456 --> 01:47:47,151
Shit!

383
01:47:54,999 --> 01:47:56,762
There's a station.

384
01:48:08,846 --> 01:48:11,041
[whispers, indistinct]

385
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:18,020
[bell clanging]

386
01:48:18,122 --> 01:48:20,215
[brakes squeal]

387
01:48:46,584 --> 01:48:48,745
[train whistling]

388
01:49:13,544 --> 01:49:14,670
Max!

389
01:49:16,547 --> 01:49:18,606
I do this for a living!

390
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:47,501
[heavy breathing]

391
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:32,017
We're almost...

392
01:50:32,823 --> 01:50:34,791
...at the next stop.

393
01:50:36,427 --> 01:50:38,520
Hey, Max...

394
01:50:41,899 --> 01:50:45,460
A guy gets on the MTA
here in L.A. and dies.

395
01:50:50,974 --> 01:50:53,204
Think anybody will notice?
