1
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,432
I canceled the last one.

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,976
That's right.
Now move, move, move, move.

3
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,979
It's my very special recipe.

4
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,648
We're not gonna make it
if we don't hurry.

5
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,609
You realize how late we...

6
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,695
I told you,
you're gonna break those toys.

7
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:12,946
Just stop.

8
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,824
Oh, wow! Wait!
Santa Claus, come quick. Look.

9
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,451
Incoming!

10
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,204
Take cover!

11
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,423
Let's get them!

12
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,511
Come on over here!

13
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,013
Hurry up! Hurry!

14
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,193
It's Lee Majors!

15
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,862
The Six Million Dollar Man.

16
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,073
Santa, is there a back way
out of this place?

17
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,241
Of course there is, Lee.

18
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,035
But this is one Santa
that's going out the front door.

19
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,162
Look, it don't matter a hill of beans
what happens to me.

20
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,997
The world couldn't afford it
if anything happened to you.

21
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:04,998
Now you stay put.

22
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,167
That's very nice of you, Lee.

23
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,880
And, Lee, you've been
a real good boy this year.

24
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,925
- Yes, you sure have.
- Yeah!

25
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,971
7:00. Psychos seize Santa's workshop.

26
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,222
Eat this.

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,141
And only Lee Majors can stop them.

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,227
The Night the Reindeer Died.

29
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,942
8:30, and America's best-loved singer

30
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,154
invites you to share
a home-style holiday

31
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,409
when it's Bob Goulet's
Old Fashioned Cajun Christmas.

32
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,294
9:00, IBC presents
America's favorite family

33
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,546
in a special Christmas episode.

34
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,966
Hi, Mom. Where's Dad?
He should have been home by now.

35
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,595
Well, Wally, if I know your father,
he's out chasing Beaver.

36
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,972
Father Loves Beaver.

37
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,934
Here on IBC. You'll love it.

38
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,501
Show me the Scrooge promo.

39
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,558
It was a cold, bleak Christmas...

40
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:51,188
10:00, IBC presents live,
via satellite from New York,

41
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:55,776
Bethlehem, Helsinki, West Berlin,
and the Great Barrier Reef,

42
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,528
Charles Dickens'
immortal Christmas classic,

43
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,905
Scrooge.

44
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,281
Starring Buddy Hackett,

45
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,449
Jamie Farr,

46
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,909
the Solid Gold Dancers,

47
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,995
and Mary Lou Retton as Tiny Tim.

48
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,956
Hosted by Sir John Houseman.

49
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,123
Bah, humbug.

50
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,417
Scrooge.
It will touch your every heartstring.

51
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,003
That's right.
It all starts on Christmas Eve.

52
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,464
Christmas Eve on IBC.

53
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,132
You'll love it.

54
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,055
Oh, my gosh,

55
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,391
does that suck.

56
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,029
You know
who loves Mary Lou Retton, Frank?

57
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,447
My kids.

58
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,909
- Yeah.
- Children love an acrobat.

59
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,082
Oh, God.

60
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,878
We have spent $40 million
on a live TV show.

61
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,799
You guys have got an ad
with America's favorite old fart

62
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,720
reading a book in front of a fireplace!

63
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,392
Now I have to kill all of you.

64
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,485
Mother, help me.

65
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,654
Excuse me, sir.

66
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,990
I don't wanna be
out of line here, but...

67
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,327
Well, we've been running that spot now
for over a month and,

68
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,912
well, it's getting a hell of a response.

69
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,334
I am the youngest president

70
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,920
in the history of television,
for a reason.

71
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,381
I know the people.

72
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,302
Well, granted,

73
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,971
but the people already wanna
watch the show.

74
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,517
That isn't good enough!

75
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,021
They have gotta be
so scared to miss it!

76
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,647
So terrified!

77
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,943
Now, if I were in charge,

78
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,612
and I am...

79
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,369
Perhaps I can help you.

80
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,955
Here's the kind of thing
I would have done. Grace, cue it up.

81
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,469
Acid rain.

82
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,558
Drug addiction.

83
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,521
International terrorism.

84
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,899
Freeway killers.

85
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,110
Now, more than ever,

86
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,196
it is important to remember
the true meaning of Christmas.

87
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:50,325
Don't miss Charles Dickens'
immortal classic, Scrooge.

88
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:55,163
Your life might just depend on it.

89
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:02,879
Not bad, eh?

90
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,051
I think they'll like it
in the heartlands.

91
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,014
I want it every hour, on the hour.

92
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,766
I'll take care of it, Frank.

93
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,186
Get me Standards and Practices
in here. I want to see Reece.

94
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,188
Excuse me, sir.

95
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,606
Yes?

96
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,733
Mr. Cross,

97
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,863
what exactly does that ad
have to do with Scrooge?

98
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,739
Nothing. Why?

99
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,784
Well, you can't show that commercial.

100
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,245
If you run that, you're gonna...

101
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,872
You're gonna frighten people.

102
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,373
You think I'm way off base here?

103
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,585
Yes. Well, you're a tad off base, sir.

104
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,797
That thing looked like
The Manson Family Christmas Special.

105
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,758
Well, it's a little late
to get this kind of feedback.

106
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,680
That's because this is the first time
I've ever seen it, sir.

107
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,016
You're right. I sprung it on you.

108
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,934
Well, it's not that bad, it's...

109
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,394
Just lose, like,

110
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,771
you know,
the part with the gun and the blood...

111
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,566
- All right, all right.
...and the guy shooting up, and the...

112
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,110
If I can change it,
I'll let you know in five minutes.

113
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,820
Well, thank you, sir.

114
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,697
Thank you.

115
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:14,242
You know, in a lot of ways,
I think we're a little bit alike.

116
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,746
Sir, merry Christmas.

117
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,832
- Thanks for the talk.
- Thank you.

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,460
We don't wanna
scare the dickens out of people.

119
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,086
Merry Christmas, Miss Cooley.

120
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,506
The dickens out of people!

121
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,174
Nobody gets me.

122
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,552
Grace, who is that guy?

123
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,930
- Eliot Loudermilk.
- OK.

124
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,182
Call Security.
Have them change his locks,

125
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,059
clean out his desk
and toss him out of the building.

126
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,477
He's fired?

127
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,605
But it's Christmas!

128
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,940
Thank you.

129
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,943
Call Accounting. Stop his bonus.

130
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,447
- A clear shot at his back.
- Eliot Loudermilk.

131
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,366
Code 9.

132
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,535
Grace, what in the hell is this?

133
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,704
Well, that's a painting
one of my kids did.

134
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,457
There's Santa Claus,
and there's Mrs. Claus.

135
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,168
Honey, how many fingers
does Mrs. Santa Claus have here?

136
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,629
- Eleven.
- Eleven. Right.

137
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,298
It's crap. Lose it.
I don't want it on the walls.

138
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,841
She'll understand.

139
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,469
She's an amazingly
understanding woman.

140
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,971
I'll just come home and I'll say,

141
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,432
"Hi, honey. We have to move
to a studio apartment.

142
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,642
I hope you don't mind."

143
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,188
Mr. Cross,
it's time for your Christmas list.

144
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,941
OK, read me the list.
I wanna get this over with.

145
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,651
Sammy Goldberg.

146
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,403
Bath towel.

147
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,696
Lou Parker.

148
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,073
Send him a VHS home video recorder.

149
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,950
Colonel Tom Parker.

150
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,494
The bath towel.

151
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,830
- Tamara Forristal.
- VHS.

152
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,835
You know, there's a lot of virtues
in taking a bus to work, you know.

153
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,005
Hi, fellas.
Thanks a lot and merry Christmas.

154
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,632
- Bobby Lou Caluda.
- The bath towel.

155
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,428
Eliot Loudermilk's leaving early today.

156
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,763
Move. Get out of here.

157
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,973
Done!

158
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,475
Four minutes and 40 seconds.

159
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,394
Glenn Glenn Whitacre?

160
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,896
What was the last rating on Police Zoo?

161
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,733
5.2 Nielsen, 7 in share and a TVQ of 3.

162
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,650
Towel!

163
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,152
Your brother?

164
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,781
- Towel.
- Your only brother.

165
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,492
Oh, God, Grace. Give it to me.

166
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,370
Get that.

167
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,872
Towel, towel.

168
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,915
- Mr. Cross' office.
- Towel. VHS.

169
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,501
- Thank you.
- Most of these are towels.

170
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,878
Be wrong once, OK?

171
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,172
Mr. Rhinelander's on his way down.

172
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,638
Booze.

173
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,389
Pardon me.

174
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,642
Excuse me.

175
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,145
Grace.

176
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,732
Put yourself down for a towel, too.

177
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,150
What about my bonus?

178
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,402
Towel and a face cloth.

179
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,695
Shit!

180
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,697
- Frank.
- Hey, Pres.

181
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,824
- What a surprise.
- Grace.

182
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,660
You look great.
You've been working out.

183
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,328
Why didn't you tell me, Grace?

184
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,206
Preston, just looking at some
of this ink we're getting on Scrooge.

185
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,999
Mary Lou Retton as Tiny Tim.

186
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,251
Can you believe
the first director didn't want her?

187
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,419
- No.
- Well, he does now.

188
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,754
He go bye-bye.

189
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,964
Hey, did you catch her buy
on Tiny Tim?

190
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,258
She doesn't just throw away
the crutches and walk.

191
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,927
She throws away the crutches,

192
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,180
vaults over a lamppost,
double somersault,

193
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,599
back into one of these things.

194
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,059
- Frank.
- Killer.

195
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,227
Yes, Preston?

196
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,814
Have you any idea how many cats
there are in this country?

197
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,360
No.

198
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,404
I don't have those... No.

199
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,031
Twenty-seven million.
Do you know how many dogs?

200
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,284
- In America?
- Forty-eight million.

201
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:47,038
- Wow.
- We spend $4 billion on pet food alone.

202
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,581
Four?

203
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,626
Now, I have here a study
from Hampstead University

204
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,672
which shows us that cats and dogs
are beginning to watch television.

205
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,883
Now, if these scientists are right,

206
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,927
we should start programming right now.

207
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,222
Within 20 years,
they could become steady viewers.

208
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,725
Programming for cats?

209
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,562
Walk with me, Frank.

210
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,024
Call the police.

211
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,948
Now, I'm not saying,
build a whole show around animals.

212
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,242
- Oh, no.
- All I'm suggesting

213
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,495
is that we occasionally throw in
a little pet appeal.

214
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,372
Some birds, a squirrel.

215
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,332
- Mice.
- Mice. Exactly.

216
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,960
Remember Kojak and the lollipops?

217
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,839
What about a cop that dangles string?
That's his gimmick.

218
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,383
Lots of quick, random action.

219
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,095
Frank, wasn't there
a dormouse in Scrooge?

220
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,849
No. But now that you say it,
I always felt that it needed a dormouse.

221
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,018
- Dormice. Better.
- Bingo.

222
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,272
Frank, this show is the jewel
in the IBC crown.

223
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,149
Everything is riding on it.

224
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,652
Don't worry, Preston. I'm overseeing
every aspect of production.

225
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,987
We'll own Christmas.

226
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,281
That's what I wanted to hear.

227
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,535
- Lunch tomorrow? Chez Jay?
- Right.

228
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,870
- Up, Sid.
- Yes, sir.

229
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,289
- Study this.
- Thank you.

230
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,916
Oh, God.

231
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,336
If only I could fire
that poor son of a bitch.

232
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,964
Hey, Frank!
Hold that door, will you, pops?

233
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,674
Wait for me a minute, will you?
You don't mind?

234
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,219
Hey, it's Brice Cummings.
We met at Spago.

235
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,678
Have you seen Preston?

236
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,722
Preston just went back upstairs.

237
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,850
I just dropped by to say hello.
I went to school with the big guy's son.

238
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,936
You give me a call
when you hit the Coast, OK?

239
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:36,064
Let's go. You know, so, anyway.
So, Cosell said...

240
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,952
Come here. Slam this door. Hard.

241
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:53,540
Grace, I need a full report
on a guy named Brice Cummings.

242
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,375
He's an LA slimeball.

243
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,919
OK.
You're due at Helmsley Palace at 7:00.

244
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,547
- And I'm gonna leave. I'm gonna take...
- No, you're not.

245
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,257
You're staying here with me.
We're working late.

246
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,925
I have to take my son to the doctor.

247
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,594
Grace, when I work late, you work late.

248
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,555
But I made the appointment
two months ago.

249
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,265
I care!

250
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,518
We're indivisible. If I'm
working late, you gotta work late!

251
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,145
If you can't work late,
I can't work late!

252
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:20,233
If I can't work late, I can't work late!

253
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,948
Oh, your brother's waiting inside.

254
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:31,202
Oh, and I didn't tell him
about his great Christmas towel.

255
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,835
Francis.

256
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,297
A little bit rough on her out there,
weren't you?

257
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,466
You know what they say about
treating people badly on the way up?

258
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,843
Yep.

259
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,429
You get to treat them badly
on the way down, too.

260
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,765
It's great.
You get two chances to rough them up.

261
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,606
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

262
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,986
Why don't the cops
do something about this?

263
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,279
Excuse me, please.

264
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,616
Great. Rip off the hicks, why don't you?
Did you learn this song yesterday?

265
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,825
Sweet.

266
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,161
Frank, you don't like Christmas much,
do you?

267
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,079
Like it? I love it.

268
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,498
It's cold. The people stay home
and watch television.

269
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,208
Ad revenues go up 30%.

270
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,045
All these idiots are gonna be home
watching the boob tube for me tonight.

271
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,297
I am the biggest fan
that Christmas ever had.

272
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,467
So, any chance of you maybe
making Christmas dinner this year?

273
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,635
None.

274
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,678
- Come on. Why not?
- Don't start, James.

275
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,389
Come on, the whole family will be there.
It'll be fun.

276
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,142
Look, you can have your concerned
and wonderful dinner

277
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,477
with all your cool friends

278
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,396
and the real popcorn and the tree
and cranberries and everything,

279
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,107
send Christmas cards to each other
on recycled paper.

280
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,651
It's a crock, James.

281
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,194
It's for kids.

282
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,488
You know, I like seeing you.

283
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,531
I like being with you.

284
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,202
I want you to have a happy New Year.

285
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,536
Taxi!

286
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,121
Merry Christmas.

287
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,665
Taxi!

288
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,252
Excuse me, ma'am.
I think you dropped something there.

289
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,797
Hey, that's my cab.

290
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,091
Oh, sir, please. I...

291
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,592
Leona Helmsley's
and step on it, will you?

292
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,344
You son of a bitch,
you should burn in hell!

293
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,721
Bye-bye, grandma. Bye-bye.

294
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,477
I got into broadcasting
because I like to give.

295
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:24,190
Sometimes I found myself hurting
from giving too much,

296
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,901
and I'd say, "Stop it."

297
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,489
I'm always gonna cherish this.

298
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,242
And all of you.

299
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,080
I should have went in there.

300
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,958
I should have said,
"Frank Cross, you gotta..."

301
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,890
You stinking... You big dog, you...

302
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,234
- $4.85.
- Here's $5.

303
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,131
- Mr. Cross.
- Mr. Cross.

304
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,763
Wasn't he a medical genius?

305
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,975
Calvin, I think "doctor"
is a Latin word for "thief."

306
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:45,772
$200 I don't have
to tell me that you don't speak.

307
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,608
I'm your mother.
I know you don't speak...

308
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,817
...yet.

309
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,321
We'll show them, honey.

310
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,657
You're gonna surprise a lot of people.

311
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,992
Yes, you are.

312
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,578
You start talking,

313
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,914
then go to law school
and sue his butt off.

314
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,165
OK.

315
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,256
Come!

316
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,303
Who's there?

317
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,041
This office is closed!

318
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,335
This whole wing is closed!

319
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,797
Grace!

320
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,776
That was a good one.

321
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,530
How are you, kid? You're...

322
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,993
Will you excuse me?
I'll make myself a little drink.

323
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,757
I don't mind you hitting me, Frank,
but take it easy on the Bacardi.

324
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,228
God.

325
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,064
To old times, my friend.

326
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,869
Oh, my God. It's...

327
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,873
Lew Hayward.
Your old boss and your best friend.

328
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,499
But you're...

329
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,839
...dead.
- Seven years.

330
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,009
Has it been that long? Jeez, I...

331
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,930
I mean, to look at you, I wouldn't
have guessed more than three, tops.

332
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,598
Oh, Frank.

333
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,892
Frank, you are in trouble.

334
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,019
- Big trouble.
- All right.

335
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,188
Let's just say, for argument's sake,

336
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,106
that you're right,
that I am in big trouble.

337
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,524
What exactly would that mean?

338
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,402
Look at me. Look at your future.

339
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,738
Now, if you don't change your ways,

340
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,325
you're gonna wind up doomed,
just as I am.

341
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,081
One minute I'm on the 14th hole
at Winged Foot,

342
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,666
lining up a putt.

343
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,503
A heart attack later, I'm a worm feast.

344
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,463
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

345
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,006
You're not a worm feast.

346
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,635
You're a hallucination
brought on by alcohol!

347
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,304
Russian vodka poisoned by Chernobyl!

348
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,682
I've been under
a lot of pressure lately.

349
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,767
- I've been putting on a big...
- Silence!

350
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,813
I had it all.

351
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,856
I was a captain of industry,

352
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,986
feared by men, adored by women.

353
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:24,573
Adored! Let's be honest, Lew.
You paid for the women.

354
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:28,661
I'm warning you, Frank.
Don't waste your life as I did mine.

355
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,872
Waste? How can you say that.
You're a legend in this business.

356
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,666
You are the man
who invented the miniseries.

357
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,502
Mankind should have been my business.

358
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,339
Charity, mercy, kindness,
that should have been my business.

359
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,633
Don't wait. Get yourself involved.

360
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,593
Now it's too late for me,
but it's not for you.

361
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,095
You can be saved.

362
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,516
You are going to be visited
by three ghosts.

363
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,477
- Three ghosts.
- Three ghosts, Frank.

364
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,731
Expect the first one tomorrow at noon.

365
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,442
God, tomorrow's bad for me, Lew.

366
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,320
As a matter of fact,
the whole rest of the week is a washout.

367
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,572
Well, maybe we could have drinks,
say, Thursday.

368
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,407
You, me, the ghost.
Trader Vic's around 4:00?

369
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,618
This is no joke, Frank.
This is your last chance!

370
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,747
All right.
I could squeeze you in for a breakfast.

371
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,587
Oh, no, please.
They'll think I'm a suicide.

372
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,339
No.

373
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,425
Oh, God.

374
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,386
We're way up here. Give me a break.

375
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,222
- You can be saved.
- Don't let go!

376
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,600
- Don't let me go, Lew! God bless you!
- You've got time!

377
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,436
No, no. No, please!

378
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,362
- Merry Christmas.
- Don't let me go, Lew!

379
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,137
Hi, this is Claire Phillips.
I'm not here, as usual.

380
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,181
Leave a message for me
and I'll call you right back.

381
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,058
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

382
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,060
Speak at the beep.

383
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,646
Claire!

384
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,191
This is Frank Cross.

385
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,819
I know it's been...

386
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,655
...15 years since we talked

387
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,826
but I really need
to talk to you right now.

388
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,328
I... Something terrible has happened.

389
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,834
Or maybe not. I don't know. But I...

390
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,837
Whatever, I have to talk to you,
no matter what. It's urgent.

391
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,505
Call me at any hour.

392
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,299
My number is 674-9565.

393
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:51,262
674-95... Damn!

394
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,375
Well?

395
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,420
- Well, what?
- Did you get the bonus?

396
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,507
I'm drying my head with it.

397
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,721
Hey, we'll be all right. Don't worry.

398
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,057
- What are you doing in there?
- Trimming the tree.

399
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,727
- We don't have a tree, Mom.
- We do now.

400
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,771
- No!
- Yes.

401
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,815
Don't plug him in!

402
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:45,983
Plug him in.

403
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,070
- Look at the little angel.
- Take it off. Take it off.

404
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,363
Take it off of him.

405
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,824
But, Mom, he looks so pretty.

406
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,951
He look even cuter than last year.

407
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,244
Look at Granny, darling.

408
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,246
Mom, when are we going
to get a real tree?

409
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,706
When they're free.

410
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,294
Have you seen
this morning's paper, Frank?

411
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,964
- Who's that? She's pretty.
- She's dead, Frank.

412
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,342
Apparently,
this 80-year-old grandmother

413
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,345
was watching your Scrooge promo
last night and she just...

414
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,388
She just keeled over.

415
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,599
It scared her to death.

416
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,022
This is terrific!

417
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,608
I knew that ad worked!

418
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,945
You can't buy publicity like this!

419
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,657
Excuse me.

420
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,995
Mr. Cross, you're needed on the set.

421
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,375
I want that promo run every half hour.

422
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,918
I want a disclaimer at the top.

423
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,254
"Anyone with a heart condition
must leave the room."

424
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,421
Will do, Frank.

425
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,881
Right. Where were we?

426
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,050
Buzz, I was being haunted.

427
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,218
OK.

428
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,470
No, it's gotta be real gold.

429
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,389
I don't understand...

430
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,974
You can't do this
at the eleventh hour.

431
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,475
...why I can't
possibly get anybody

432
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,977
- to do what I want them to do.
- Oh, jeez.

433
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,562
- Give me a break.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Cross.

434
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,481
I am the censor, and I will not
allow this costume on the air.

435
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,649
Why not?

436
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,278
Well, specifically,
you can see her nipples.

437
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,113
I want to see her nipples!

438
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,490
But this is a Christmas show!

439
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,952
Well, Charles Dickens would have
wanted to see her nipples then.

440
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,955
You can hardly see them nipples.

441
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,583
See? And these guys are really looking.

442
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,543
You can go shake a tail feather.
Thanks.

443
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,753
And thank you. You can just go.

444
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,839
Watch out.

445
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,259
Thanks, boys. Get the nurse.

446
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,886
Get the nurse. Get the nurse!

447
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,347
Make sure her nipples are covered up,
will you?

448
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:44,268
Lumpy!

449
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,824
Hi.

450
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,954
I'm sorry to just...

451
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,540
Well, I didn't get your message
until this morning.

452
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,960
And I tried to call but they
said that you weren't in yet.

453
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:14,089
And then I tried to call back and they
said that you were busy, so I just...

454
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,009
God, you look different.

455
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,261
Well, it's been a while.

456
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,930
It's your hair.

457
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,643
I've never seen it so short.
It makes you look sort of

458
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,810
grown-up.

459
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,022
Yo, Frank. Frank!

460
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,524
I mean, Mr. Cross. Check this out, man.

461
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:36,570
Girls are tough. It's on the money.
Check it. Come on. Here we go, ladies.

462
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,614
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

463
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,616
Five, six, seven, hit it!

464
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,163
- Can I turn her head?
- No.

465
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,374
All right. That works. See?

466
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,001
And boom! And boom!

467
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,003
Little booty here for you.

468
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,923
See? Show me a nipple.

469
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,551
See, you just had to see it in context.
Can you move her, please? Thanks.

470
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,178
Alley-oop.

471
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,389
Is she gonna be all right?

472
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:07,101
Oh, yeah. She's a real pro.
She's very professional.

473
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,020
What about you?
You sounded like you'd seen a ghost.

474
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,023
A ghost?

475
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,110
You mean the phone call last night?

476
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,656
I came across your number
and I just had to call you immediately.

477
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:24,993
I know you, Lumpy. I know that voice.
That was the frightened Lumpy I heard.

478
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,412
Excuse me, Lumpy.

479
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,331
Around these parts,
most people call me Mr. Cross.

480
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,583
I'm sorry.
I'm new here and I got a problem.

481
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,085
I'll bet. What?

482
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,337
Well, my problem is this little fella.

483
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,299
I can't get the antlers glued
onto this little guy.

484
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,176
We've tried Krazy Glue,
but it don't work.

485
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,470
- Have you tried staples?
- Staples?

486
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,847
Don't you dare.

487
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,599
If you staple that little mouse,
I'll call the Humane Society.

488
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,767
I'm not kidding.

489
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,728
I wouldn't do anything in the world
to hurt this little fella.

490
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,564
Hey, Marlin Perkins. The road.

491
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,773
I have three dogs and a cat at home.

492
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,693
Oh, beautiful story.
Tell Reader's Digest, will you?

493
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,404
Staples?

494
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,782
Same old Claire.

495
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,034
Still trying to save the world.

496
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,954
You still trying to run it?

497
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,332
Hip-hop, hip-hop. Let's go.

498
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,752
- Get out of here!
- Oh, OK.

499
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,088
- You called me.
- Who are you anyway?

500
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,299
You little worm.

501
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,510
Who are you? How'd you get in here?

502
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,680
Well, maybe you'll answer some
questions downtown, huh, my friend?

503
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,766
What the hell is going on?

504
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,811
- This is my little boy.
- All right, you beat him.

505
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,439
- Does he work here?
- No, he does not.

506
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,859
I thought it would be fun for him
to see a live television show.

507
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,028
You see anybody having fun here?

508
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,948
Why are you so angry?

509
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,409
Why haven't you ever learned
how to button a coat?

510
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,786
Well...

511
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,497
You know me. I just... I was in a hurry.

512
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,375
- Heads up.
- Heads up. Ladder coming through.

513
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,965
I'm sorry
to have called so late last night.

514
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,092
I must have woken up
your husband and your kids.

515
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,180
No, no. I've never gotten married.
I'm still on my own.

516
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,348
You?

517
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,725
No.

518
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,310
- No?
- No.

519
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,940
Would you hold
the goddamn hammering, please?

520
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,275
- Yes, sir.
- I better go. You're busy.

521
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,236
No! No, don't go.

522
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:26,365
Would you hold
the goddamn hammering,

523
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,825
- please?
- Frank.

524
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,369
Frank, what did happen last night?

525
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,997
Claire, it was something that I ate.

526
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,000
It was probably a bad clam
or something. We don't know yet.

527
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,422
Well, if it happens again...

528
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:47,970
...give me a call here.
I'm hardly ever home.

529
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,306
I'm definitely gonna call
because I'm a seafood nut.

530
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,684
And, you know, to not eat clams is...

531
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,102
What the hell's life for?

532
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,483
Would you please, for the love of God,

533
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,319
and your own body,
hold the hammering?

534
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,238
Claire.

535
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,074
Sir, it's the Times. They want
a reaction to the woman's death.

536
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,159
Well, we slapped her in the face
and got her attention.

537
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,619
It was probably something she ate.

538
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,664
He said that it was
probably something that she ate.

539
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,625
This is Frank Cross.

540
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,920
We at IBC are shocked and appalled
by this senseless tragedy.

541
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,131
Coming as it does
at this season of giving...

542
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,926
Would you please hold
the goddamn hammering?

543
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,344
Now!

544
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,637
You got it.

545
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,148
Oh, shit!

546
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,401
I'm going to lunch.

547
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,738
So, how's everything going, Frank?

548
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,948
Couldn't be better, Preston.

549
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:53,660
Mr. Rhinelander, hello. Mr. Cross.

550
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,038
May I get you gentlemen
something from the bar?

551
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,165
Yes. I'd like a highball.

552
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,875
I'll have a highball, too.

553
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,968
You've heard from the embassy?

554
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,345
Yes, everything's fine.

555
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,180
We're gonna be switching live

556
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:17,225
back and forth from our Scrooge
in the studio to Berlin

557
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,437
where we've got LeRoy Neiman
painting the Wall for us.

558
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,356
Then we're gonna shoot on
out to Africa

559
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,442
where the Holy Father is gonna
bless the entire Zulu nation.

560
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,445
We think it's the largest baptism
of all time.

561
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,364
That's just the point, Frank.

562
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,699
I'm afraid you might be
spreading yourself a little thin.

563
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:36,703
So I've taken the liberty
of hiring somebody to work with you.

564
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,915
- Oh, great.
- I knew you'd be pleased.

565
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,209
I couldn't be more pleased.

566
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,711
- Who is it?
- Pellegrino, rocks, twist.

567
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:48,048
Well, we meet again, huh?
How are you?

568
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,634
Oh, look at this.
Blue is a bad color for New York.

569
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,345
Frank, I realize
this is coming at you pretty damn fast,

570
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,640
but I want you to understand
that my only function here

571
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,142
is to take some of the burden
off of your shoulders.

572
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,229
A lot of men in your position
would see me as a threat.

573
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,605
It's only natural.

574
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:04,982
That's me.

575
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:09,069
You are going to be visited
by three ghosts.

576
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,239
Expect the first one tomorrow at noon.

577
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,658
Frank, I realize
this is coming at you pretty damn fast,

578
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,785
but I want you to understand
that my only function here

579
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,787
is to take some of the burden
off of your shoulders.

580
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,914
A lot of men in your position
would see me as a threat.

581
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,833
It's only natural.
But, whoop, that's me.

582
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,460
Have you ever seen a watch like this?
It's a real beauty, isn't it?

583
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,670
My dad gave me this.

584
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,138
But...

585
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,477
But when Preston hired me this morning

586
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,979
as a sort of, what?

587
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,606
A consultant, I suppose you might say,

588
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:50,110
I said to him,
"Consider me just one of the team."

589
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,073
My lacrosse coach used to say,

590
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:58,160
"There is no 'I' in T-E-A-M."

591
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,454
Here we are, gentlemen.

592
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,830
- This one for you, sir.
- Thank you.

593
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,999
And one for you.

594
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,853
- I'm terribly sorry. I...
- Are you him?

595
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,022
Are you him?

596
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,357
Are you he?

597
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,985
I'll take it away.

598
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,654
Now don't...

599
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,616
Don't come apart on me, Frank.

600
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,702
No.

601
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,789
No. What was that
that your lacrosse coach said?

602
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,832
No, the point is, Frank...

603
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,793
Excuse me, gentlemen,
are you ready to order?

604
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,088
Great. Yeah.
I'll have the California health plate.

605
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,839
No dairy in that, huh?

606
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,718
- How's the rack of lamb today, Bobby?
- Excellent choice, sir.

607
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,970
Sir?

608
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,890
Oh, my God.

609
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,018
Bobby.

610
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,895
Bobby, look! Somebody save him!

611
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,855
Oh, no. That's a baked Alaska, sir.

612
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,066
No, that's a dessert.
You wouldn't want that, sir.

613
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,194
- Look!
- Oh, no, no, no, sir.

614
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,322
That gentleman had a meatloaf.
You wouldn't want that, sir.

615
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,367
It's not very... It's full of... Sir?

616
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,496
- I'm gonna have...
- Have?

617
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,331
I'm gonna go have some air.

618
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,833
Excuse me.

619
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,676
I'm sorry.

620
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,346
You know,
I thought you were Richard Pryor.

621
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,820
- Get me a cab!
- Yes, sir.

622
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,418
All right, cut through the park
and take me over to...

623
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,254
Hey, man!

624
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,758
Watch out!

625
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,770
Wrong way, jerk!

626
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,064
Nice hit back there! Solid hit!

627
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,485
- You're going the wrong way!
- Relax, Frank. Enjoy the ride.

628
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:41,114
- How do you know my name?
- I know absolutely everything, Frank.

629
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,576
You see, I'm the ghost.

630
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:00,300
- You don't mind if I smoke, do you?
- Smoke! Smoke! Just drive!

631
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,188
Oh, thanks, pal.

632
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,661
What did you do?
What did you do? What did you do?

633
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,165
That's not funny! Not funny!

634
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,127
All right! Pull over! Pull over!

635
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,053
- Where are we?
- "Where are we?"

636
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,347
You mean, "When are we?"

637
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,354
Look out!

638
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,401
Go back to Jersey, you moron!

639
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,532
- Take me home right now.
- You got it, pal.

640
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,084
Welcome home, Frankie.

641
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,546
Oh, my God!

642
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,258
This is where I grew up.

643
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,386
- I thought they tore this place down.
- They did.

644
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,222
Guess my dad hasn't put up
our Christmas lights yet.

645
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,934
Oh, for Christ's sakes, Frank,
it's Christmas Eve.

646
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,646
I get it.

647
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:40,150
You're taking me back in time
to show me my mother and father,

648
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,569
and I'm supposed to get
all goosey and blubbery.

649
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,821
Well, forget it pal,
you got the wrong guy.

650
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,490
That's exactly what Attila the Hun said.

651
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:51,786
But when he saw his mother,
Niagara Falls.

652
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,164
Let's get this over with.

653
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,592
That was a great joke.

654
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,594
I love that bit!

655
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,433
Quiet. Somebody will call the cops.

656
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,227
Oh, relax, Frank.

657
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:20,899
They can't hear us. They can't see us.
This is not live. It's like a rerun.

658
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,484
Check it out.

659
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,320
See? Here I am.

660
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,031
We all drink our
chocolate-flavored Ovaltine every day

661
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,283
to help give us what we need
for rocket power.

662
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,454
The Lone Ranger!

663
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,293
That's the...

664
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,259
Hello, Earl.

665
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,644
Here, Francis.

666
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:01,314
I've got something for you.
Merry Christmas.

667
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,402
- A choo-choo train?
- No, it's five pounds of veal.

668
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,031
But, Daddy,
I asked Santa for a choo-choo.

669
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,993
Then go out and get a job
and buy a choo-choo.

670
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,663
Earl, he's only four years old.

671
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,999
All day long, I listen to people
give excuses why they can't work.

672
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,836
"My back hurts. My legs ache.

673
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,380
I'm only four!"

674
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,633
The sooner he learns
that life isn't given to you

675
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,510
on a silver platter, the better!

676
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:37,267
You know, we've all been doing
everything we possibly can...

677
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,768
I'm going up.

678
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,107
Baby, don't watch too much TV.
It's bad for your eyes.

679
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,442
OK, Mommy.

680
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,028
Merry Christmas, Frankie angel.

681
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,489
Merry Christmas to you, Mama.

682
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,046
Niagara Falls, Frankie angel.

683
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,724
I was touched by a gift.

684
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,060
A four-year-old kid receives
what in today's marketplace

685
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:24,022
is a $40 or $50 piece of milk-fed veal.

686
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,193
Frank, you still spent
the next 15 years of your life

687
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,944
sitting on your ass watching television.

688
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,906
Check the records, chump.
I did some stuff.

689
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,325
I was a baseball player.

690
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,911
One year, I hit the home run
that won the big game.

691
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:41,414
That was the kid
on The Courtship of Eddie's Father.

692
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,461
There was another time, though,

693
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,088
that I was running down a hillside
that was covered with flowers,

694
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,675
and there was a beautiful girl,
like 15, with pigtails.

695
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,511
- And she was waiting for me.
- You are so pathetic!

696
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,346
And her parents didn't know
she snuck out of the house.

697
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,098
That was
the Little House on the Prairie!

698
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,604
Was it the "Homecoming" episode
of Little House?

699
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,941
Yes, it was the "Homecoming" episode
of Little House.

700
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,317
Let's face it, Frank.

701
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,903
Garden slugs got more out of life
than you did.

702
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,364
Name one.

703
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,534
Take me to my office.

704
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,035
Gladly!

705
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,831
- Where are we?
- It's your office.

706
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,459
- Isn't that where you wanted to go?
- What's going on?

707
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,336
It's their Christmas party.

708
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,463
They've had Christmas parties here

709
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,715
since the dawn
of the golden age of television.

710
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,301
Till you took over, you big stiff.

711
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,431
Merry Christmas. Pass those out.

712
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,439
Brook, Brook. Hey, wait for me.

713
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,535
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, Fred! Fred!

714
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,454
- It's Frank, Mr. Hayward.
- Frank.

715
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,416
You didn't happen to notice
a big Christmas party

716
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,085
- going on around here, did you?
- Yes, I did see one, sir.

717
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,337
I'm gonna be right on it.
I'm just gonna finish this.

718
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,589
OK.

719
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:17,427
- Merry Christmas!
- Why, thank you, Tina.

720
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,055
- Frank! Frank!
- Oh, hi.

721
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,141
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, Tina.

722
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,476
You're not leaving, are you?
You wanna go get some Chinese food?

723
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,729
Oh, wow, no.
You're not supposed to eat that stuff.

724
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,856
They found out that
they're cutting up the alley cats

725
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,733
and using them in chop suey.
It's a real bummer.

726
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,443
Don't eat that stuff.

727
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,280
You idiot! You moron, get back there!

728
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,032
I don't believe myself.

729
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,742
What an idiot I am!

730
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,243
Did you see that Tina?

731
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,954
Frankie, I'm not that dead.
Now come on.

732
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,708
I must have been out of my mind!
She was crazy about me.

733
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,252
Not that one, Frankie. Not that one.

734
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,420
This one.

735
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:58,468
Cupid's arrow, right between the eyes.

736
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,012
Oh, God! Are you all right?

737
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,556
You know,
you probably shouldn't move someone

738
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,725
who's had a bad blow to the head.

739
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,940
- Where did I get you?
- You got me right here.

740
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,860
And the sidewalk got me back here.

741
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:20,239
It's gonna be quite a lump.
I'm sorry. Here.

742
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,371
Is this yours?

743
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,581
Yes, it is. Thank you.

744
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,501
You had some things, didn't you?

745
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,835
- Yes.
- Here.

746
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,133
All right. Tell you what.
I'll go down for them.

747
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,260
OK. Good idea.

748
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,930
- Wait for me. Yeah?
- Yes, I'll wait.

749
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,439
- Thanks, Lumpy.
- Thank you.

750
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,235
- Merry Christmas.
- Say,

751
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,112
would you like to go
to a Christmas party

752
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,531
- that's going on right now?
- Not really.

753
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,032
Neither would I.

754
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,660
Young lady!

755
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,663
Do you shop here all the time?

756
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,582
Because if you do, I can walk
on the other side of the street.

757
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,677
Would you like
to go get some Chinese food?

758
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:29,267
- All right, what's going on?
- You are gonna love this.

759
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,602
- Claire?
- Yeah.

760
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,312
Claire?

761
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,441
Yeah, what is it? I'm in the tub.

762
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,943
Can't we open the presents now?

763
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,904
What are you doing?

764
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,281
Oh, come on, don't be a creep.

765
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,950
- Yeah, you had it all, let me tell you.
- Yeah. Look at something else.

766
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,536
Hey, look, there's a gorilla
climbing up on that big building.

767
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,125
When can we open these?

768
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:58,171
You can open one on Christmas Eve.
That's what we always did in my family.

769
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,882
You have to wait until
Christmas morning to open the rest.

770
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,175
Isn't that what you did?

771
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,470
Well, if it were gonna spoil,
we opened it the night before.

772
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,806
Well, you wanna open this one?

773
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:10,808
Is this for me?

774
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,864
Knives!

775
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,949
Oh, good!

776
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,369
Oh, lots of knives.

777
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,371
I got her these great knives.

778
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,290
- They're super sharp.
- I know, I know.

779
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,209
- They don't make them in the States.
- Ginsu knives.

780
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,460
- They are really sharp.
- They cut cans.

781
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,588
You can cut a tin can
as easily as a tomato.

782
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,302
Your turn.

783
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,056
I've never liked a girl enough
to give her 12 sharp knives.

784
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:54,393
OK. You're gonna like this.

785
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,980
"To Lump."

786
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,608
"Love, Claire."

787
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,075
You're such an animal.

788
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,332
"The Kama Sutra.
The Hindu art of love."

789
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,960
Read the inscription.

790
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,297
No. You read the inscription.
It says "Christmas,"

791
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,674
and then the rest is...

792
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,551
- It's Sanskrit.
- It's Sanskrit.

793
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:30,513
I didn't need any kind of manual.
I want you to know that.

794
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,726
Don't blow the ending for me now.

795
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,565
- Did that.
- With who?

796
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,191
- Did it.
- Yeah.

797
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,651
Done this.

798
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,822
Done this. Buddy of mine did this.

799
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,450
Now this is ridiculous.
I don't believe this for a second.

800
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,202
- What?
- Says there's a place that

801
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,663
you can touch a woman
that will make her bark like a dog.

802
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,129
Lassie's come home.

803
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,507
Lassie, go get Gramps.
Go get Gramps, Lassie.

804
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,594
I wonder if you're female.
Let's turn her over and find out.

805
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,972
Hey. Oh, what a nice coat you have.

806
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,058
I think I should
give you a bath every week.

807
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,733
Good morning, kiddos!

808
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,152
This is Mike the Mailman!

809
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,778
Hey, Frisbee!

810
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,740
I got something for you.

811
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,159
Come on. Oh, there he is.

812
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,411
I really gotta watch out
for this one, eh?

813
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,540
What goodies does he have?
Is it a pair of mittens?

814
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,584
It's a bone!

815
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,338
What could it be? Is it a book?

816
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,173
It's a bone!

817
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,467
You can't figure it out,
can you, Frisbee?

818
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,887
It's a bone, you lucky dog!

819
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,431
It's a bone, you betcha!

820
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,853
Oh, kids, isn't this terrific?

821
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,772
Lassie's a pretty good friend, eh?

822
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,650
And we're into
a commercial break, folks.

823
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:16,369
- Very good, kid. Very good.
- Thank you. Thank you.

824
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,245
So, how many reservations
should I make?

825
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:21,374
Oh, yes. There'll be you, me, my wife...

826
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,584
No, your wife's in Palm Springs.

827
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,420
Oh, yes, yes. I forgot. Of course.

828
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,173
Well, I guess then
it will be you and me.

829
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:34,720
And Frank. Frank, I want you
to have dinner with us tonight.

830
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,180
- You and your girl.
- Claire.

831
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,556
Right, Claire.

832
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,101
And order us a stretch limo, too.
See you downstairs.

833
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,602
OK.

834
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:46,065
- Hello. Why, you're Claire.
- Yes, nice to meet you.

835
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,901
Oh, hi, sweetheart.

836
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,279
You almost ready?

837
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,242
The president of the network
just invited us to dinner.

838
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,535
Oh, no, we can't tonight.

839
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,912
We're going to
David and Kate's for dinner.

840
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,622
We planned it for a month.

841
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,625
But you can't expect a man like this
to make plans a month in advance.

842
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,919
We can have dinner with them
next week.

843
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,295
Next week?

844
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,631
It's Christmas Eve.
They're our best friends.

845
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,550
It only comes once a year.

846
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,176
Thanks, Phil, babe.

847
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,012
Yeah, it is Christmas.

848
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,347
It's a time to be
a little bit less selfish, you know.

849
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,976
Maybe if you could put my needs
and the needs of the Frisbee Show

850
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,644
ahead of your own needs...

851
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,480
I mean, I have been fighting
for the integrity of this show.

852
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,815
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.

853
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,401
- I'm sorry.
- Sixty seconds!

854
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,530
I guess I didn't realize
how important it is to you.

855
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,451
Well, I'm willing to forgive you
once in a while. I am.

856
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:40,911
Frank, look.

857
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,207
Maybe we should separate for a while.

858
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,169
- Excuse me.
- Estelle?

859
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,378
- Yeah?
- When is that limo leaving?

860
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,298
Oh, right after the show.
You know how he is.

861
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,467
For a while

862
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,385
and see how it goes.

863
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,846
I mean, I know you've been
under a lot of pressure.

864
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,641
Oh, it's been rough.

865
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,944
All right.
I'll try to come over later if I can.

866
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,363
Fifteen seconds.

867
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,083
I'll tell them that you got hung up.

868
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,669
Lumpy.

869
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,007
Merry Christmas.

870
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:42,681
Five, four, three, two, one.

871
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:43,849
OK, kiddos...

872
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:47,144
You left Claire for Frisbee the Dog?

873
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,606
Frank, let me sum this up for you.

874
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:54,193
You don't know who you are,
you don't know what you want,

875
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,363
and you don't know
what the hell is going on.

876
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,698
I've made a few mistakes.

877
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,784
I gotta live with that.

878
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,287
But I know who I am.

879
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,540
I know what I want.

880
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,083
And I know what's going on.

881
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,002
Hey, Frank. Over here.

882
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,546
What's going on?

883
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,340
How am I supposed to know?
I'm only the ghost.

884
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:19,218
So long, sucker!

885
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,680
Hold on! Hello, taxi!

886
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:32,314
I have seen your nobler aspirations
fall off one by one

887
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,693
till the master passion, greed,
engrosses you.

888
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,654
Farewell, Ebenezer.

889
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:42,783
May you be happy
with the path that you have chosen.

890
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,954
Well, I am happy with the path
that I've chosen, you little bitch!

891
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,706
In fact, I couldn't be happier!

892
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,542
What are you? Crazy?

893
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,127
Yeah, Buddy, I'm crazy!

894
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,212
Crazy like a fox!

895
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,090
Crazy enough
to see through your little tricks.

896
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,593
I'm back. I can see now.

897
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,012
No one could have been
that simple and good,

898
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,308
and sweet, and kind, and decent,
yet caring, wonderful.

899
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,810
Not on this planet! No, baby.

900
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,980
Not unless they had something to hide,
some sort of trick up their sleeve.

901
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,940
You wouldn't try to trick me, would you?

902
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,444
Don't try to trick me today
because I'm back, Jack!

903
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,072
Maybe we'll just check things out
over there at Operation Reach Out.

904
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,407
Pick a side, grandma.

905
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,742
Goodbye. Thank you.

906
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,286
...blood drive. $20 a pint.
Come on, folks.

907
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,539
Here's a happy donor.
Thank you so much.

908
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,584
Merry Christmas.

909
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,799
Well, just for the record, you left me.

910
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:44,136
You had to go somewhere and get
your head together or something.

911
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:47,097
Well, baby, my head is just fine.
Check it out!

912
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,933
It's right here where it belongs!

913
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,854
What's the point?
It's lonely at the top?

914
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,940
It's not lonely at the top.

915
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:59,443
Oh, maybe around my birthday
and at sunset.

916
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,986
And there have been
a couple of weekends

917
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,864
that would have raised hell
with even a really normal person!

918
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:07,368
But that's me. I'm a widow of business.

919
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,954
That's my life! I've chosen it!

920
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:13,624
At least I work someplace that you can
find when you're looking for it!

921
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,962
OK, here we are now.

922
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,839
When I want a wife,

923
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,008
I'm gonna buy one!

924
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,679
And she's going to be devoted to me,

925
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:29,223
to my wants and my needs,

926
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,933
not like you!

927
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,519
Let's face it, you treated me like dirt!

928
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,854
Oh, Lord! Another wild and wooly one.

929
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:39,149
Honey, you look frozen.
Come over here.

930
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,360
Let me get you a nice hot cup of coffee.

931
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,195
And now you sit right there,
I'll bring it to you.

932
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,613
Robert, get up!

933
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,573
Hi, Dick. Herman.

934
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:48,742
I'm Billy.

935
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,661
Eva. Eva. That's me.

936
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,247
- Oh, cocktail hour.
- Drink for Mr. Richard Burton.

937
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,124
- Drink up.
- Here, Dave.

938
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,917
Drink just for me.

939
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,877
For you, Dave.

940
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,632
That Dick sure knows how to live, huh?

941
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,134
Why do you keep calling me Dick?

942
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,219
I'm sorry, Mr. Burton.

943
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,889
Maybe we don't know you well enough
to call you Dick

944
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,392
but after Exorcist II
and Night of the Iguana,

945
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,185
we thought we had something special.

946
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:18,022
So could you please just do
a couple of lines from Hamlet?

947
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,982
- Please.
- Or The Sandpiper?

948
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,109
Leave me alone!

949
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:25,821
- Do Cleopatra for me, please, Dick.
- Please do it.

950
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,490
- Please, do it for Eva.
- Yeah.

951
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,076
I am Mark Antony...

952
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,620
All those who don't know Abyssinia,

953
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:36,373
to know the rain
before nightfall of Cheops.

954
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,667
I swear. By thee I full swear.

955
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,420
Oh, isn't that marvelous?

956
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,964
- Now beat it before I beat you!
- Eagles.

957
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,258
- Where Eagles Dare.
- Yeah.

958
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:51,096
- Lumpy, what a surprise!
- Oh, God! Oh, God! Claire!

959
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,142
- What are you doing here?
- Claire. Claire.

960
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,811
Well, you said if it happened again,
that I should come by.

961
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,522
- Well, what happened?
- Well...

962
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:05,110
I have been thinking a lot
about the past,

963
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,529
and, you know, when that happens,
you start thinking to yourself,

964
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,240
"Well, I've made a lot of decisions,
you know.

965
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,618
And what would have happened

966
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:15,079
if I had made different decisions?"

967
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,539
Do you know what I mean?

968
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,416
Are you talking about regret?

969
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,211
Yeah, yeah, I'm talking about regret.
Yeah!

970
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:25,714
You know, the one good thing about
regret is that it's never too late.

971
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,133
You can always change if you want to.

972
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,845
- I deal with that every day.
- OK, well, deal with this.

973
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,973
I wanna take you someplace right now

974
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,394
and eat Chinese food.

975
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:41,355
Claire, we got some huge problems
this time!

976
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:44,483
- There ain't a fuse in the whole joint!
- Oh, no, there are fuses.

977
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,527
I'll show you where they are
in just a second, Hazel.

978
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,029
- The A&P didn't send any turkeys.
- No.

979
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,740
Oh, no, they were
supposed to be here hours ago.

980
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,076
- Not one.
- OK, I'll call them in just a second.

981
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,661
- No...
- Can you wait? Could you wait for me...

982
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,704
Well, they can handle this.
This isn't a big deal.

983
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,039
I mean, it's just some fuses.

984
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,916
You go down to the hardware store
and you buy fuses.

985
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,752
- What about the turkeys?
- And the turkeys are at the A&P?

986
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,587
- Look it up in the phone book.
- No, no, no.

987
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,549
It's under "A" and if you
can't find it there, it's under "P."

988
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,217
I have to call them myself.
I'll call them in just a second, OK?

989
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,635
You don't have to call them.

990
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,138
These are big girls,
very big girls, and they can do it.

991
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,765
- Attagirl!
- I'll be right... I'll be right there.

992
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,976
- I'll be...
- No, Claire, please. Fire these people.

993
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,936
- Fire them?
- Yeah, you fire them.

994
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,730
They're volunteers. They're here
out of the kindness of their hearts.

995
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,650
They're volunteers because no one
will pay them! They are incompetent!

996
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,735
It's Christmas Eve.

997
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:32,114
They're like this every day of the year.
I guarantee it!

998
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:36,577
Look, if you'll just wait one minute,
I just gotta make the phone call...

999
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,203
- No, don't bother.
- Just a couple...

1000
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:41,165
- Don't bother, OK?
- If you'll just wait one minute,

1001
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:43,292
let me just finish organizing
what I'm doing,

1002
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,626
I'll come with you, Frank.

1003
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,086
Take the rest of your life!

1004
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:50,424
I'm gonna give you some advice, Claire.
Scrape them off.

1005
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,302
You wanna save somebody?
Save yourself.

1006
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,805
Oh, that's a wonderful attitude to have
on Christmas Eve.

1007
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,266
Merry Christmas.

1008
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,313
Bah, humbug!

1009
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,194
Lumpy.

1010
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,407
Hey, Dick, can you lend me $2
so I can heat my place?

1011
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,242
Herman, I blew it all on Liz.

1012
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,036
There's a sucker inside.

1013
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,329
Thanks.

1014
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,540
This is the last dress rehearsal,
so let's get it right.

1015
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,215
Come on, Buddy, it's your cue.
Get moving.

1016
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,718
Cue, Mr. Houseman.

1017
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:38,931
"Ebenezer Scrooge hurried
past the ragged boys

1018
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:41,642
who stood shivering in the snow,

1019
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:45,270
gnawed and mumbled
by the hungry cold,

1020
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:48,273
as bones are gnawed by dogs."

1021
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:52,611
Why do I have to be molested
by these sea urchins?

1022
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,238
- Street urchins?
- No, Buddy, baby.

1023
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,573
Look, look, right here, Buddy.
Here's what it says. "Street urchins."

1024
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:59,117
I said "street."
Why would I say sea urchins?

1025
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,578
OK, everybody, what'd he say, huh?
Sea urchins, street urchins?

1026
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,580
- Street urchins.
- Street, oh, oh.

1027
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:06,750
He did say street urchins?
I'm sorry, Buddy. You're right.

1028
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,794
OK everybody.
That's dinner, one hour!

1029
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,797
That includes walking time! One hour!

1030
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,508
You're doing great.
You're doing great, Buddy.

1031
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:15,717
We need more snow over here.

1032
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,511
We gotta
watch that boom shadow, huh?

1033
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,471
You're right on my urchins.

1034
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:23,183
Oh, Frank! Man! Baby, how are you?

1035
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:25,852
Oh, God, we were so worried about you.
Are you OK?

1036
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,021
Everybody was worried sick, huh?
You all right?

1037
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:30,023
Listen, I call the meal breaks
around here.

1038
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,233
Oh, Frank, I'm sorry.

1039
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,318
Look, if it means that much to you,
I'll call everybody back

1040
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,820
and you can tell them
it's time to go to dinner.

1041
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:38,407
Hey, everybody, hold on a minute,
Frank's got something to say to you!

1042
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,825
Go ahead.

1043
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,036
I think it's time
you and I had a little talk, Brice.

1044
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:46,164
Frank, I'd love to but, you know,
Preston asked me to stop by for a drink.

1045
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:49,167
So if you don't mind,
I'll take a rain check, OK?

1046
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,337
Paul, where are you? I need a cigarette!

1047
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,176
Hey.

1048
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:08,270
Hey!

1049
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,406
Hi, Frank!

1050
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,826
Come on!
Come on out and play with me.

1051
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,163
One, two, three, four,

1052
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,248
five, six, seven, eight.

1053
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,834
...two, three, four,

1054
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,794
five, six, seven, eight.

1055
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,716
Oh, I'm a little muddled.

1056
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,052
Seven, eight.

1057
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,679
One, two, three, four.

1058
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:45,307
Oh, I'm so relieved. It's been so long.

1059
01:00:57,195 --> 01:01:00,530
Hello, Frank.
I'm the Ghost of Christmas Present.

1060
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,407
I had a funny feeling.

1061
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,453
Why did you do that?

1062
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,789
Sometimes you have to
slap them in the face

1063
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,749
just to get their attention.

1064
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,418
Fine, slap me in the face.

1065
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,880
- But you kicked me in the...
- Hush, Frank.

1066
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:20,300
It's time to begin our journey.

1067
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,969
And now close your eyes

1068
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,264
- and think...
- No.

1069
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:29,976
- You close your eyes! I'm through...
- Oh, no. Don't be quarrelsome.

1070
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,979
Close your eyes and think

1071
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:36,483
of snowflakes, and moonbeams,

1072
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,735
and whiskers on kittens.

1073
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,154
No peeking!

1074
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,410
Of rainbows, forget-me-nots,

1075
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:51,456
of misty meadows
and sun-dappled pools.

1076
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:57,713
Oh, look, there's Mr. Hedgehog.

1077
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,715
I wonder where he's going.

1078
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,259
Perhaps to Harlem!

1079
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,721
Oh! Oh, no!

1080
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,723
I cracked you.

1081
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,268
Oh, God, my jaw.

1082
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,813
Sometimes the truth is painful, Frank.

1083
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:19,651
But it's made your cheeks all rosy
and your eyes bright as stars.

1084
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:23,280
If you touch me again,

1085
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,491
I'm gonna
rip your goddamn wings off, OK?

1086
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:29,953
You know I like the rough stuff,
don't you, Frank?

1087
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,288
Oh, God.

1088
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,207
Jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle
Jingle, jingle, jingle bells

1089
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,585
- Hi!
- Hi!

1090
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,796
- Come on, Calvin.
- Hey, Calvin.

1091
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:42,132
Merry Christmas, Cooley family!

1092
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:46,052
Ma, you didn't have to come and get me.
I could have rode the subway.

1093
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,472
I don't want you riding the subway
at this time of night by yourself.

1094
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:49,639
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1095
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:52,350
- Good.
- Hi, Mom!

1096
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,311
- Come on, Mom.
- Oh, get out of here.

1097
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,521
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Mom.

1098
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:59,191
"Hi, Mom." Is that all I'm gonna get?

1099
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:02,819
Well, now I'm gonna get freshened up.
I'm gonna leave in a minute, get ready.

1100
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,324
Leave it alone. No one can do it.

1101
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,911
Shasta, Randee,
you two go wash up now, you hear?

1102
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:12,078
OK, Gramma.

1103
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,290
Think of your fellow man

1104
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,376
Lend him a helping hand

1105
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,754
Put a little love in your heart

1106
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:25,091
Oh, look! He did it.

1107
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:27,219
- He's a bright little guy.
- Oh, yes.

1108
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:28,512
What's wrong with him?

1109
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:32,557
He hasn't spoken since he saw
his father killed five years ago.

1110
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:36,770
He just drifted away,
like Sleeping Beauty.

1111
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,898
I didn't know
that Grace's husband had died.

1112
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,107
Oh, Frank,

1113
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:45,070
don't you remember that period
when she wore black for a year?

1114
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:49,449
I remember her wearing black
but I thought it was a fashion thing.

1115
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:52,077
I mean, people
were wearing black, you know.

1116
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,745
Oh, Frank.

1117
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,872
My, my, poor Frank.

1118
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,250
Well, is he gonna be OK?

1119
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:02,963
It's his choice.
Only he can break the spell.

1120
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:05,757
You're gonna be a doctor soon enough.
This is Christmas, honey.

1121
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,552
Girls, put some love in his heart!

1122
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,720
- Get back!
- A little Christmas loving, go ahead.

1123
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,681
A Merry Christmas. God bless us.

1124
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,600
- God bless us, every one.
- Leave me alone! Mama!

1125
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,269
Mama!

1126
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,896
Put a little love in your heart

1127
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:22,607
Oh, oh! Come in, Frank.

1128
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:24,776
Come in and join the fun.

1129
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:31,449
What a lovely family,
and they're so happy.

1130
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:35,203
They're so happy
but so poor, you tightwad!

1131
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,581
I'll check my records.
She may be due for a raise.

1132
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:39,916
- May be?
- Probably!

1133
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:41,459
- Probably?
- Yeah, yeah.

1134
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:43,211
May be, probably, perhaps?

1135
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,088
I'm almost positive.

1136
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,215
- Get off your brother!
- Get off me. Leave me alone.

1137
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,593
This boy is mine!

1138
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,554
That looks like fun!

1139
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,892
Cut it out! Stop it! Stop it!

1140
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:01,313
Don't forget to watch the show.
I'm taking Calvin with me, Mama.

1141
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:05,191
- More! More!
- Hey, come on, Frank.

1142
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,235
Next stop's downtown!

1143
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,954
How was your trip, Frank?
A little jump, huh?

1144
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:19,998
Hi, Cujo.

1145
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,209
Bark! Bark!

1146
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:25,337
Who is here?

1147
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:29,466
- What are you barking at out there?
- Go, go.

1148
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,801
You are really crazy.
There's nothing there. Now come on.

1149
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:33,261
Come on.

1150
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,931
All right, let's get down to business.

1151
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,308
I want you to stay here
and I want you to...

1152
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:41,311
Oh, my, what a merry feast.

1153
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,564
- It looks like a beer commercial.
- Let's go in.

1154
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,692
Don't vex me, Frank,

1155
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,070
or I'll fix your mouth
so it won't hold soap!

1156
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:55,450
A Christmas party.
I'm so glad I wore my pretty dress.

1157
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,995
"On The Addams Family, what
musical instrument did Lurch play?"

1158
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:04,042
On The Addams Family,
what musical instrument did Lurch play?

1159
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,962
- Piano.
- I may be invisible but I'm not deaf!

1160
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,965
- OK, OK, we're gonna say piano.
- It was the piano.

1161
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,383
- Harpsichord.
- Harpsichord.

1162
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,176
A harpsichord, James, you dope.

1163
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:15,804
- Oh, you knew that.
- Everybody knows that.

1164
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:17,973
It's their house.

1165
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,266
We better give it to them or else
they'll have us hanging Sheetrock.

1166
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:23,228
You shouldn't have given that to them.
I wouldn't have given that to them.

1167
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:24,813
- Give it to them.
- James,

1168
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,982
you forgot to
open your brother's present.

1169
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,567
That doesn't look like a towel.

1170
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:31,027
What did he get for last year?

1171
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:33,029
- I don't remember.
- I remember.

1172
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:34,572
A shower curtain!

1173
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,534
It was a beautiful shower curtain.
It was gray with these IBC logos.

1174
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,869
It had little... Yeah!

1175
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:42,080
- You don't have one.
- Well, what did you get him this year?

1176
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:44,040
Oh, nothing.

1177
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,752
I made this picture frame.

1178
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,547
He made it with his own little hands.

1179
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:52,632
How sweet.

1180
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,259
I know something you don't know.

1181
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:57,137
I know something you don't know.
I know something you don't know.

1182
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:58,555
Shut up!

1183
01:06:58,723 --> 01:06:59,723
Jackpot.

1184
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,728
It's your basic
top-of-the-line Pioneer VCR.

1185
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,814
- I think he made a mistake.
- This ought to work.

1186
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,566
I didn't get the gifts mixed up.

1187
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:12,944
My ex-secretary got the gifts mixed up.

1188
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,196
You invite him
to Christmas dinner every year

1189
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,490
and every year, he's too busy to come.

1190
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:19,534
And when are you gonna learn?

1191
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,911
Never. He's my brother.

1192
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,289
A toast...

1193
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,292
...to my brother Frank.

1194
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,711
- I wish he was here.
- Were, goofy.

1195
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:31,796
You're too good.

1196
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:34,174
- To Frank.
- To Frank. Cheers!

1197
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:36,009
The richest man you know.

1198
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,635
Keep the VCR.

1199
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,596
What the hell.

1200
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,681
It's only money.

1201
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:46,269
- It's a write-off. It's tax-deductible.
- I understand, Frank.

1202
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,229
I understand.

1203
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:52,859
OK, "What was the name of the boat that
took them all to Gilligan's Island?"

1204
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:56,112
This is so easy.

1205
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,406
The Mako.

1206
01:07:58,574 --> 01:07:59,824
You gotta know this.

1207
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:01,534
- S. S. Mackerel.
- No.

1208
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:03,078
- The fish.
- It's a fish.

1209
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:04,746
Let's go now, Frank.

1210
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,498
Leave me alone. I know this one.

1211
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:09,000
Everybody knows this one. Let's go now!

1212
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:11,503
Oh, yeah?
Does everybody know this one here?

1213
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:16,257
Oh, Frank, we're fighting again.
Let's not fight anymore!

1214
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:19,594
Oh, look, Frank. What is it?

1215
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:20,887
I can't find the card.

1216
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:23,014
It's a toaster!

1217
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,265
The answer is Mackerel.

1218
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,939
The bitch hit me with a toaster.

1219
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,192
Oh, I love a girl with spirit. Right!

1220
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:37,028
Well, this is nice.

1221
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:38,988
Where are we, Trump Tower?

1222
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:41,366
I've seen a little bit of the city.

1223
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,744
Hey, hey, down here! Hey! Down here!

1224
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:49,040
Hey, you! Hey, Jersey!
Call Streets and Sanitation!

1225
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,167
Wow! Thanks for the shot.

1226
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,502
Hey! Hey!

1227
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,796
Oh, I'm having the weirdest day!

1228
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:56,381
Cop!

1229
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:59,259
Hey, Cop! Help me, please!

1230
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:20,488
Herman!

1231
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:22,740
Coffee's on me. Come here.

1232
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,661
Jesus, give me a happy ending here,
Herm. Come on, man.

1233
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:39,007
Herman, it's Dick.

1234
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,635
Liz says hi.

1235
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:49,767
Jeez, maybe I should've given you
the two bucks, huh?

1236
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:52,937
Herm.

1237
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,319
You moron!

1238
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:01,571
You jerk!

1239
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:06,117
Why didn't you stay at Claire's?
Why didn't you stay with Claire?

1240
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:07,619
She would have taken care of you!

1241
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:09,662
You would have eaten!
You would have been warm!

1242
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,331
You might be alive!

1243
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:14,250
You'd be a prettier color,
I'll tell you that!

1244
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:20,423
OK, is there a way
to get out of here, Herman?

1245
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,350
It's the door, isn't it?

1246
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,398
It is the door, isn't it?

1247
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:39,651
It's the door!

1248
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,946
It had to be the door

1249
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:46,324
'cause it's the only place
that doesn't smell like urine!

1250
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:54,249
Oh, shit!

1251
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,125
What's going on up there?

1252
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:58,002
Paul, where are you, kid? I need you.

1253
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,254
Jesus Christ, hang on a second.

1254
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,465
Hey, you! Joker!
Hey, get off the set, will you?

1255
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,676
- Hey!
- Yeah, we see you, pal.

1256
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:06,344
Get off the set!

1257
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,180
- Oh, my God!
- It's Mr. Cross!

1258
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:12,558
Hey, Frank, we've been looking
all over for you, buddy.

1259
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,686
Frank. Come on, Frank.
Frank, Frank.

1260
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:15,979
I was worried about you.

1261
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:17,146
Just like Errol Flynn, huh?

1262
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:18,898
- No, he's OK.
- Very funny.

1263
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:21,859
Come on. You go upstairs to your office.
Kind of supervise things.

1264
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:23,653
You can check up
the satellite linkups, huh?

1265
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:25,905
- Brice, we got three minutes till air.
- I know how much time we got.

1266
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,866
I just want to say,
break a leg, everybody.

1267
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,994
I feel real weird about tonight.

1268
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:34,455
Yeah, do you hear that, folks? OK,
this one's for Frank. This is his baby.

1269
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,165
Come on, come on, come on.

1270
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,459
Don't lose it on me, huh? Come on.

1271
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:42,672
You know, it has been such an honor
to work for the great Frank Cross.

1272
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,842
I'm gonna dine out on this for months.
You know what I'm saying?

1273
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,885
Now I want Grace
to take you upstairs now

1274
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:51,055
where I think things might just be
a little safer than down here. OK?

1275
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:54,309
You're beautiful, Frank.
Got any last tips for me, huh?

1276
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:00,940
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Grace, go watch the show.

1277
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:03,568
He's here for me! Come on!
All right, come on! Give it to me!

1278
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,821
You think I'm afraid of you,
the day I've had?

1279
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:11,242
I know what you came for.
Come and get it, you pussy.

1280
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:14,078
- Brice!
- Stop scaring Frank.

1281
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:16,539
- Get this nutcake out of here.
- Who is that guy?

1282
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:18,291
- Oh, Jesus.
- We got a show to do.

1283
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:22,253
He's in the show, Mr. Cross,
as the Ghost of Christmas Future.

1284
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:25,923
He's great.

1285
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,509
That guy is gonna be a big star.

1286
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:31,304
All right, go watch the show.
We're making history tonight, I think.

1287
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:33,514
OK, video...

1288
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,558
Five seconds till we open on B.

1289
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,643
- Then we go live.
- Right.

1290
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:46,402
God bless us, every one!

1291
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:53,117
Tonight, live on IBC,

1292
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:55,661
the world premiere telecast
of a Christmas classic,

1293
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:58,081
Charles Dickens' immortal Scrooge.

1294
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,346
- Ready to roll B.
- B on the bell tower.

1295
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:15,681
- Don't screw up...
- Roll tape B.

1296
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:16,933
Hold there, three.

1297
01:13:18,268 --> 01:13:19,811
All right, coming up on three.

1298
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:22,146
Three, two, one. Dissolve it.

1299
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:23,940
- And dancing.
- Right where you are.

1300
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:27,235
Slow pullout on three.
Slow pullout on three.

1301
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,821
Down on Houseman, lights up.
Ready, mic him in.

1302
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:33,324
It was a cold, bleak Christmas Eve.

1303
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:35,993
The fog-draped streets of London...

1304
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:38,746
Oh, you've got Houseman.
I think he's wonderful.

1305
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,873
- Give me the beer.
- Yes, sir.

1306
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:43,668
...a phantom through the dingy mist.

1307
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:46,170
Old Ebenezer Scrooge,

1308
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:49,215
alone in his gloomy chambers...

1309
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:51,426
We'll make that move as soon as
we get off of Houseman.

1310
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,636
Coming to camera three live.
Dissolve three.

1311
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:57,974
- What have we here?
- They're dormice, Uncle.

1312
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:00,893
Dormice? Dormice?

1313
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:02,478
You see? Works like a charm.

1314
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:04,230
- What do they do?
- They bring you luck.

1315
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,565
Are you lucky?

1316
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:09,318
Sir, I believe I am.
I've got your niece for my wife.

1317
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:12,196
I've got a good job,
and it's the holidays, sir.

1318
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:14,198
Holiday, is it?

1319
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:16,993
You have my niece for a wife all right.

1320
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:20,496
Do you have my job too?
That's the luck.

1321
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:25,334
"To Frank,
the best brother a guy ever had.

1322
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:28,546
Merry Christmas."

1323
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:33,342
When the snow lay round about

1324
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:35,470
Deep and crisp and even

1325
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:38,431
Brightly shone the moon that night

1326
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:41,058
Though the frost was cruel

1327
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,603
When a poor man came in sight

1328
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:47,732
Gathering winter fuel

1329
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,569
This is indeed a night for revelation.

1330
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:54,655
Thank you for showing me
the true meaning.

1331
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,741
Thank me not, Ebenezer,

1332
01:14:56,909 --> 01:15:00,995
for soon you shall be visited
by the final spirit.

1333
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:05,124
The thing that all men fear the most.

1334
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:07,835
The Ghost of Christmas Future.

1335
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:09,754
Oh, thank you, sir.

1336
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,798
I'll be so good. I'll repent.

1337
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,447
Honey, I'm home!

1338
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:41,953
- Oh, boy!
- Remember me, boss?

1339
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,789
The guy you canned
the day before Christmas?

1340
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,124
Merry Christmas!

1341
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,002
Hello, wabbit.

1342
01:15:50,837 --> 01:15:52,088
Would you give me a running start?

1343
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:56,592
Sure. 1,001, 1,002, 1,003.

1344
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:01,389
My God! My babies!

1345
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:11,148
Oh, you better watch out

1346
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:13,734
Can't you get back to me on this
after the holidays?

1347
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,069
I've had a bad day.

1348
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,238
You've had a bad day?

1349
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:21,534
Let me tell you a little bit about
my day! I got fired! My wife left me!

1350
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:25,454
She took our little baby daughter...

1351
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:27,415
...with her.

1352
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:33,296
I can't recall much after that
because ever since then, I've been

1353
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:36,966
blind, stinking drunk!

1354
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,846
He sees you when you're sleeping

1355
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,598
You gotta believe me, Eliot!

1356
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:46,392
I'm having a much worse day
than you are!

1357
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,727
Much worse! Really!

1358
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:51,814
He knows if you've been bad

1359
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:57,445
So be good, for goodness' sake

1360
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,698
Oh, he's making a list

1361
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:02,908
He's checking it twice

1362
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,161
Gonna find out

1363
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,496
Who's naughty or nice

1364
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,542
Santa Claus is coming

1365
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:13,919
To town

1366
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:23,596
It's you. Creep.

1367
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,432
God. Aren't you supposed to be
in the studio? We're on the air.

1368
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,017
Hey, back off, big man.

1369
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:30,436
That may work with the chicks
but not with me.

1370
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:32,313
Is this straight?

1371
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:36,108
May I?

1372
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:48,412
Did our people do that?

1373
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:51,082
We're gonna get phone calls.

1374
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:16,023
Visiting hours are over, Mrs. Cooley.

1375
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:21,862
- I just got here.
- I know but we have to go.

1376
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:27,034
Merry Christmas, Calvin.

1377
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:32,790
I'll see you.

1378
01:18:43,301 --> 01:18:47,096
Now, this is just possible future,
right? I mean, this is doable.

1379
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:49,682
I know the head of pediatrics at NYU.

1380
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,892
We can get this kid out of here
right away.

1381
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,144
This is not a problem.

1382
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:55,020
I'm all over this. Don't worry about it!

1383
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:05,364
Will you look at that?

1384
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:08,242
Where did they come from?

1385
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,077
Hey, you! Beat it!

1386
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:11,412
- Please.
- Please.

1387
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,164
- Gilles.
- Madame?

1388
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:15,332
Will you look at that?
Look at those filthy little creatures.

1389
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,335
- Immdiatement.
- Oh, Claire! Claire!

1390
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:22,047
Claire! Claire!
Claire, they're just children.

1391
01:19:22,215 --> 01:19:25,217
Please, darling, don't tell me.

1392
01:19:26,344 --> 01:19:31,223
I wasted 20 years of my life
on pathetic little creatures like those.

1393
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:34,977
Finally, thank God,
a friend of mine said to me,

1394
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:38,689
"Scrape them off, Claire.

1395
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,649
You wanna save somebody,

1396
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:42,902
save yourself."

1397
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:45,905
I'm sorry, Claire.

1398
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:48,282
Thanks a lot, Lumpy.

1399
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:56,874
That was a lousy thing to do.

1400
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,675
Disneyland?

1401
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:32,535
Wendie!

1402
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,496
Oh, no.

1403
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,499
James, my brother.

1404
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:41,043
He's dead.

1405
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:44,046
Why did this have to happen?

1406
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:50,803
Well, when I get back I'm gonna...

1407
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,681
Well, there he is! James!

1408
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:58,519
Who's in there?

1409
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,813
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

1410
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:03,148
He maketh me lie down
in green pastures.

1411
01:21:03,316 --> 01:21:07,111
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake."

1412
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:10,281
What the hell
is this that you're saying?

1413
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:12,116
What? That I've died?

1414
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,333
Why are you showing me this stuff?
I can't do anything dead!

1415
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:24,295
Why the hell did you bother
to show me this stuff?

1416
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:26,797
James, help me.

1417
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:31,093
No. Oh, no.

1418
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:33,304
Please don't let them burn me, James.

1419
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:38,517
Jimmy, don't let them burn me!
Please don't let them burn me!

1420
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:41,687
I'm in here! Oh, God!

1421
01:21:42,522 --> 01:21:44,315
Don't let them do it!

1422
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:48,319
Don't let them do it!
Don't let them! I'm in here!

1423
01:21:49,654 --> 01:21:50,946
Mom!

1424
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:54,950
God, I want to live! I want to live!

1425
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:58,662
Oh, God, I wanna live! Help!

1426
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:03,125
I wanna live!

1427
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:05,419
I'm alive!

1428
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:06,754
Hallelujah

1429
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,048
Holy shit, what a break!

1430
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,091
I'm at work!

1431
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:13,469
Oh, God, it's the sun!

1432
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,846
I never thought
that I'd see the sun again!

1433
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:18,098
- I'm alive!
- Not for long.

1434
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,559
Milkman!

1435
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:24,188
I'm the Woodstock baby!

1436
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,106
I'm gonna start with you.

1437
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:29,693
You're one of my favorites. Come here!

1438
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:32,780
I'm alive and so are you

1439
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:37,910
You glad to see me,
or is this a shotgun in your pocket?

1440
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:40,454
OK. You've heard it. Come on.

1441
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:42,998
Great!

1442
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:47,336
- Don't hurt me.
- We're alive! Pink side! Coming back!

1443
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:48,837
Long sole!

1444
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:50,381
You know this one?

1445
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:53,926
That's my thing.
I'm going to be doing this to everybody.

1446
01:22:54,844 --> 01:22:55,928
All right, here's the deal.

1447
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:58,889
I'll hire you back
at twice your original salary.

1448
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:01,433
I'll make you my vice president
in charge of programming

1449
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:03,185
and I'll give you an office up here.

1450
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:06,063
- Would you like my office?
- No, I don't like your office.

1451
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,233
That's so you!

1452
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:10,901
What's the catch?

1453
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:14,238
The catch is that
you gotta take a shower, little man.

1454
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,281
You are ripe, whoa!

1455
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:17,908
There's a problem here.

1456
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:21,662
I was looking
for a Francis Xavier Cross.

1457
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,289
That's me, but the great thing is,

1458
01:23:24,457 --> 01:23:26,166
it's not me!

1459
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:30,045
The Jews taught me this great word,
schmuck.

1460
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:32,715
I was a schmuck. And now...

1461
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:35,092
...I'm not a schmuck.

1462
01:23:36,594 --> 01:23:38,637
Wait a minute! What time is it?

1463
01:23:39,305 --> 01:23:41,765
- Somebody stole my watch.
- It's a quarter to.

1464
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:45,269
We didn't miss it! We didn't miss it!

1465
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:46,729
- We didn't miss what?
- Christmas.

1466
01:23:46,896 --> 01:23:48,230
Merry Christmas!

1467
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,358
Are you alone in there?

1468
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:53,694
We're gonna have some fun.

1469
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,864
You and I are going to have some fun
for once in this life.

1470
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:59,158
Loudermilk and Cross together!

1471
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:03,287
My, what a glorious day.

1472
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,748
There has never been such a day.

1473
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:08,459
Say, there! You lad.

1474
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:10,836
Yes, sir? Are you talking to me?

1475
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:12,755
And take three.

1476
01:24:12,922 --> 01:24:14,214
Yes, indeed!

1477
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:16,091
Buy me a goose.

1478
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:19,136
The biggest goose in all of London.

1479
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:21,972
Camera three,
follow the coin all the way down.

1480
01:24:23,516 --> 01:24:24,933
Oh, I got it!

1481
01:24:25,935 --> 01:24:27,352
Holy shit, that's Frank Cross!

1482
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,021
- He's drunk!
- He's nuts!

1483
01:24:29,647 --> 01:24:30,898
He's finished.

1484
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:33,734
Shut up!

1485
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:36,653
Don't touch that dial and stay on him.

1486
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:38,197
- What's your name, son?
- Mike.

1487
01:24:38,364 --> 01:24:39,865
Mike, say hello
to your folks, will you?

1488
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:41,033
Hi.

1489
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:43,577
Mike is doing a great job here
for us tonight. Thank you.

1490
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:45,871
- That's Frank Cross.
- I am...

1491
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:49,124
- Is he supposed to be in the show?
- What in the...

1492
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:51,335
Good evening and Merry Christmas.

1493
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:53,504
With me in the booth
is Eliot Loudermilk.

1494
01:24:53,671 --> 01:24:55,923
- Eliot, how are we doing up there?
- Open his mic.

1495
01:24:57,217 --> 01:25:00,260
Wonderful! But I don't think
you're gonna be president tomorrow.

1496
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:04,515
At least I am
the president of the network tonight.

1497
01:25:04,682 --> 01:25:06,016
Tomorrow morning I may not be.

1498
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:09,228
You can bet
your Aunt Suzy's ash can on that!

1499
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:13,899
So, what are you doing
watching television on Christmas Eve?

1500
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:16,360
They're paying your salary, you ass!

1501
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:19,446
And what kind of a rat bastard idiot

1502
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:22,783
would schedule a live show
on a Christmas Eve?

1503
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:24,284
Only you, Frank.

1504
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:28,789
You know, a week ago, I'd have kicked
your butt right out of the building.

1505
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:32,126
But you know something?
He's absolutely right.

1506
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:36,672
You are looking at a guy
who told someone today

1507
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:40,175
to staple antlers to a mouse's head

1508
01:25:40,343 --> 01:25:41,885
to further my career.

1509
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:44,721
How many of you people
have got the brass cojones

1510
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:46,181
to try something like that?

1511
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:49,351
Follow him. Follow him. Stay with him.

1512
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:51,103
I don't know where he's going.

1513
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:54,690
All of these people, I'm sure they
have incredible families. But I have...

1514
01:25:54,858 --> 01:25:57,276
Look, I got a great brother.
Look at this guy here.

1515
01:25:57,443 --> 01:25:59,611
My brother, James.
Look how cute he was back then.

1516
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:02,406
He's lots bigger now.

1517
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:04,366
And look at me with the ears,

1518
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:06,702
the taxi driving down the street
with the doors open.

1519
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,245
Thank God my hair grew in, huh?

1520
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:09,788
Not yet.

1521
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:12,249
I got this for Christmas today from him.

1522
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,126
I gave him a towel.

1523
01:26:14,752 --> 01:26:16,962
The VCR is from Grace, James.

1524
01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:22,092
You were right about everything, OK?

1525
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:24,970
Except...

1526
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:28,974
the S. S. Minnow, James.

1527
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:32,019
What was the ship that brought them all
to Gilligan's Island?

1528
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,520
The S. S. Minnow.

1529
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:36,273
No points this round, James.

1530
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:37,608
- Shit.
- What?

1531
01:26:37,775 --> 01:26:40,485
- Wait a minute.
- How did he know we were playing that?

1532
01:26:40,653 --> 01:26:41,862
Hello, Wendie.

1533
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,494
Hello, control room!
How can I help you?

1534
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:51,038
This is Rhinelander.

1535
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:54,333
I want to talk to the idiot
who put that moron on the air.

1536
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:57,085
Brice Cummings is the idiot, sir.

1537
01:26:57,253 --> 01:27:00,631
But he can't talk to you right now
'cause he's tied up.

1538
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:06,720
Yes, in fact, he just said that
you were a flatulating butthead.

1539
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:08,013
A butthead?

1540
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:10,390
He said he never felt that way
about a man before

1541
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:12,935
but he really liked you
in a certain way...

1542
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:20,776
Whoa, I dropped her! Just kidding.
She's a doll. It's OK.

1543
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:25,280
It's all right. It's a party.
Come on, it's Christmas Eve!

1544
01:27:25,448 --> 01:27:26,823
Lighten up a little bit.

1545
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:30,035
Billy, we are gonna need champagne
for 250 people.

1546
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:32,996
And please send the stuff
that you send to me.

1547
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:34,998
Don't send the stuff
that I send to other people.

1548
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:37,918
You know, it's not too late
on Christmas Eve to have fun.

1549
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:40,128
You can call people
that you haven't seen.

1550
01:27:40,296 --> 01:27:41,630
You can call a college roommate,

1551
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:43,799
you can call, you know,
an old army buddy.

1552
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:45,175
Keep that tape rolling.

1553
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:46,510
You can call your personal banker.

1554
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:50,931
Hey! I don't hear any partying
in that booth, Eliot!

1555
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,266
Great!

1556
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:55,978
You heard him! Party!

1557
01:27:56,145 --> 01:27:57,562
Now, why wasn't I invited?

1558
01:27:57,730 --> 01:28:00,774
Now that was just an innocent window,
and you saw what I did to that.

1559
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:02,734
You know who you're dealing with?

1560
01:28:02,902 --> 01:28:06,196
I mean, it's a night.
You've got to party hearty, Marty.

1561
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:08,824
Look at this. Check this out.

1562
01:28:09,742 --> 01:28:11,285
Don't be so mean.

1563
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:14,371
Look at this. There's a rule.

1564
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:18,875
There's a tradition that says
I have to kiss this girl on the lips.

1565
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:21,253
Well, she's just upholding the law.

1566
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:24,548
It's a federal law actually,
it's not just a state thing.

1567
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:28,760
Great, Frankie!

1568
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:34,182
- All right!
- I love it!

1569
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:35,726
- Right on, Frank.
- Way to go.

1570
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:38,103
Here, Mr. Cummings.

1571
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,189
Boy, that was very good.

1572
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:42,899
But you know what?

1573
01:28:43,067 --> 01:28:44,860
It wasn't great.

1574
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:47,362
There has only been one great.

1575
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,701
There is a girl
that I wish I were with tonight.

1576
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:55,704
It's a girl
that I loved a long time ago.

1577
01:28:57,915 --> 01:28:59,666
A girl that I still love.

1578
01:29:00,126 --> 01:29:03,503
It's Christmas Eve.
It's not too late, is it?

1579
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,923
Claire, do you remember?

1580
01:29:07,091 --> 01:29:09,843
Remember the Kama Sutra, page 19?

1581
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:11,887
Legs around like this,
then this thing here.

1582
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:15,057
You circle me chanting,
burning incense, before we begin.

1583
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:18,435
Remember I said it ain't possible?

1584
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,979
Tonight I think we could do this without

1585
01:29:21,147 --> 01:29:24,399
serious physical
or psychological damage.

1586
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:26,276
Taxi!

1587
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:31,448
Can you get me to the IBC building
in three minutes?

1588
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:33,075
Which floor?

1589
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:36,787
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la la la la la

1590
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:39,956
Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la la la la la

1591
01:29:40,124 --> 01:29:43,168
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la la la la la la la

1592
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:46,963
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol
Fa la la la la la la la la

1593
01:29:47,131 --> 01:29:53,136
Fa la la la la la la la la

1594
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,433
We should be taping this.

1595
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,730
Now, how did that happen?

1596
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:06,733
That happened because
it's Christmas Eve. I'm telling you!

1597
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,360
I'm not crazy.

1598
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:09,986
It's Christmas Eve!

1599
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:13,657
It's the one night of the year
when we all act a little nicer,

1600
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:16,243
we smile a little easier,

1601
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,037
we cheer a little more.

1602
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:22,082
For a couple of hours
out of the whole year,

1603
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:25,836
we are the people
that we always hoped we would be.

1604
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:28,505
It's a miracle.

1605
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,465
It's really a sort of a miracle

1606
01:30:30,633 --> 01:30:32,926
because it happens
every Christmas Eve.

1607
01:30:33,177 --> 01:30:36,513
And if you waste that miracle,
you're gonna burn for it.

1608
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:38,598
I know what I'm talking about.

1609
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:41,476
You have to do something.
You have to take a chance.

1610
01:30:41,644 --> 01:30:43,061
You do have to get involved.

1611
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:46,565
There are people that are having trouble
making their miracle happen.

1612
01:30:46,732 --> 01:30:48,442
There are people
that don't have enough to eat.

1613
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:49,776
There are people that are cold.

1614
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:52,237
You can go out and say hello
to these people.

1615
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:55,323
You can take an old blanket
out of the closet and say, "Here."

1616
01:30:55,491 --> 01:30:58,160
You can make them a sandwich
and say, "Oh, by the way, here."

1617
01:30:58,327 --> 01:31:00,287
I get it now!

1618
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:02,664
And if you give,

1619
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:06,585
then it can happen.
Then the miracle can happen to you!

1620
01:31:06,752 --> 01:31:08,670
It's not just the poor and the hungry,

1621
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:11,047
it's everybody
who's gotta have this miracle!

1622
01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:12,966
And it can happen tonight
for all of you!

1623
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:16,344
If you believe in this spirit thing,
the miracle will happen.

1624
01:31:16,512 --> 01:31:18,472
And then you'll want it
to happen again tomorrow.

1625
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:20,056
You won't be one of these bastards
who says,

1626
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:23,226
"Christmas is once a year,
it's a fraud." It's not!

1627
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:26,646
It can happen every day!
You've just gotta want that feeling!

1628
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:30,150
And if you like it and you want it,
you'll get greedy for it!

1629
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:34,196
You'll want it every day of your life,
and it can happen to you!

1630
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:36,448
I believe in it now!

1631
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:39,910
I believe it's gonna happen to me now!
I'm ready for it!

1632
01:31:41,245 --> 01:31:44,080
And it's great. It's a good feeling.

1633
01:31:44,248 --> 01:31:47,751
It's really better than
I've felt in a long time.

1634
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,505
I'm ready.

1635
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:55,050
Have a merry Christmas, everybody.

1636
01:31:58,763 --> 01:31:59,971
You guys see Calvin?

1637
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:02,933
Did I forget something, big man?

1638
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:06,436
God bless us, every one.

1639
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,554
Oh, no.

1640
01:32:42,473 --> 01:32:44,099
Lumpy. Lumpy.

1641
01:32:44,267 --> 01:32:45,308
Lumpy, no.

1642
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:49,938
You're like boating a marlin.

1643
01:32:51,857 --> 01:32:54,901
Claire, the whole world.
Whole world, Claire.

1644
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:03,034
And they lived happily ever after.

1645
01:33:10,209 --> 01:33:12,419
Think of your fellow man

1646
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,129
Lend him a helping hand

1647
01:33:14,297 --> 01:33:17,382
Put a little love in your heart

1648
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:20,510
You see, it's getting late

1649
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:22,596
Oh, please don't hesitate

1650
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:25,849
Put a little love in your heart

1651
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:34,232
And the world will be a better place

1652
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,777
For you and me

1653
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:41,615
You just wait and see

1654
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:45,035
Another day goes by

1655
01:33:45,202 --> 01:33:47,120
And still the children cry

1656
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:50,206
Put a little love in your heart

1657
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:51,875
And the world

1658
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,293
Stand up! Stand up!

1659
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:54,544
Will be a better place

1660
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:58,298
And the world will be a better place

1661
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:02,052
For you and me

1662
01:34:02,803 --> 01:34:07,515
Just you wait and see

1663
01:34:07,683 --> 01:34:09,601
Another day goes by

1664
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:11,645
And still the children cry

1665
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:22,989
Put a little love in your heart

1666
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:26,785
Feed me, Seymour. Feed me.

1667
01:34:27,578 --> 01:34:30,246
Come on. Let's hear it
from all you folks out there. Come on.

1668
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:32,582
You don't know the words, come on.

1669
01:34:33,709 --> 01:34:37,379
Come on, let's hear it from this side
of the theater. Come on, just over here.

1670
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:39,839
All right, that's no good.

1671
01:34:40,007 --> 01:34:42,384
Come on, let's try the other side
of the theater. Come on.

1672
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:47,681
All right, how about just the men?
Come on, just the men.

1673
01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:51,267
All right, the real men,
let's hear the real men.

1674
01:34:52,645 --> 01:34:55,980
All right, all right, the women.
The women now, this time.

1675
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:59,651
No, the real women. The real women.

1676
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:01,319
You know who you are.

1677
01:35:01,487 --> 01:35:04,906
All right, you, who was making
all the noise through the whole movie.

1678
01:35:05,074 --> 01:35:07,659
My brother, the king of Christmas.
