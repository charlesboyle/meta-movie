And he had
the sweetest smile.

177
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,374
Look, instead of
a public ceremony,

178
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,742
I go in with
a small platoon...

179
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,377
pretend we're
stopping for a drink.

180
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,478
We grab a pod,
bring it back to you.

181
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,083
It blooms, the life of
the forest continues.
We're in, we're out.

(LAUGHING)
It doesn't work
that way.

183
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,787
I can't choose
unless I'm there.

184
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,056
It's about the feeling.

185
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,158
I get it
from the pods...

186
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,394
I get it
from the forest...

187
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,863
I get it
from all of us.

188
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,566
There we are.

189
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,235
Don't you have
feelings, Ronin?

190
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,604
Yes, I feel this is
a bad idea.

191
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,607
The Boggans have never
been this aggressive.

192
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,543
I'm not completely
helpless, you know.

193
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,312
I am aware.

194
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,180
But you're
the life of the forest.

195
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,950
Looking after you
is my duty.

196
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,753
Is that the only
reason you do it?

197
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,221
Isn't that
reason enough?

198
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,224
If that's the only
reason there is.

199
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,625

200
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:41,693

Very well.
I understand
your concern...

204
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:55,006
but this is the one day
in a hundred years
I can choose an heir.

205
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,541
If I don't
do this today...

206
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:00,278

a future to protect.

in the crossfire...

215
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,397

Yes, sir!

220

It's way outside
of our borders.

You mean their borders?

222
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:10,648
The Leafmen think they can
keep us contained...

beautiful island of rot...

hideous green forest.

All in the name
of balance.
I'm sick of balance.

227
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,697
No matter how
much of the forest
we destroy...

228
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,634
the queen regrows it
with one wave of her hand.

229
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:33,538
She needs to be cut down!
At the root!

230
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,641
Exactly.

231
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:42,347
Today we'll show them
you just can't stop the rot.

If the queen dies
without an heir...

233
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,587
the Leafmen can't
regrow anything.

Where's my camera?

Are you serious?

00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,509
You have to
catch these things
in the moment...

while they're happening...

357
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,779
otherwise you miss
a chance that could be
gone forever.

Look, you've got
to believe me.
I am so close.

All I need is one
little breakthrough.
This could be it!

00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:26,524
I will clear this
all up when I get back!

work that way.

Today, Queen Tara
gives her power to

Don't do anything
to embarrass me...

or it could ruin
my chances of being

a very nice-looking

one way to go.

bloom no matter what.

open tonight...

the full moon when
it's at its highest peak.

Unclear.
The last part's missing.

I gotta be honest,
termites have been
a problem.

we were doomed.

could tell me...

for me to get home.

they're not there.

That was the last
part of the queen
that I-- (SIGHS)

1041
00:57:54,572 --> 00:57:57,372
That any of us
will ever have.

1042
00:57:57,374 --> 00:58:00,609
The queen gave it to me.
I should have
been here with it.

1043
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:03,145
I'll do whatever it takes
to help you get it back.

1044
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:06,682
I appreciate the offer,
but Wrathwood
is too dangerous.

1045
00:58:06,684 --> 00:58:07,282
But you can't go alone.

1046
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:12,554
What about the whole
leaves-tree thing
that you said?

1047
00:58:12,556 --> 00:58:13,522
Nim, tell him.

1048
00:58:13,524 --> 00:58:15,824
Look, kid,
the moon's coming up.

1049
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,259
That's bloom-or-die time.

1050
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:19,127
So if no one has
a better plan--

1051
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:21,897
Why don't we sneak in,
in disguise?

1052
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:22,464
Great idea.

1053
00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:25,834
I'll go as a grasshopper
and you can be
my cricket ladyfriend.

1054
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:29,505
It's dangerous,
I might get killed.
I thought you'd like that.

1055

I don't have any
Boggan armor handy.
Do you?

1056

we can get some.

1058
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:42,584
I gotta say,
six hands are
better than two.

My son was born on
a night like this.

1064
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:01,270
These were
his baby fangs.

1065
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:04,306
And here's
the first skin
he ever molted.

1066
00:59:04,308 --> 00:59:06,375
He was big
for a larva.

1067
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:08,076
He took
after his mother.

(WEEPING)
Your stories are boring
and torturous!

1069
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:15,150
And the Leafmen
took him from me.

1070
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:19,488

something of theirs.
It's basic etiquette.

blooms in darkness,
it belongs...

00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:36,939
It will become
my little dark prince.
