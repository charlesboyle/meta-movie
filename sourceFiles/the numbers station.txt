Did you get that?

10
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,273
Yeah, I got it.

11
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,845
So I'm listening
to the radio the other day,

12
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,048
Radio 2, NPR Radio
or something...

13
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,816
Uh-huh.

14
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,586
There's some fucking guy,
scientist or something.

15
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:43,589
Real sick bastard.
You listening?

16
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:44,856
Avidly.

17
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,692
Says he measured
out the remains,

18
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:47,593
the cremated
remains of a dead man.

19
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:51,563
Measured out the, uh, minerals
left behind, you know?

20
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,867
The iron phosphates, the...
Whatever it is we're made up of.

21
00:03:55,869 --> 00:04:01,506
Says he added it all up
to the cost of $4.40.

22
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:02,874
You believe that?

23
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,576
Yeah, I guess so.

24
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,511
$4.40.

25
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,214
Burnt down man's worth less
than a fucking Big Mac,

26
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,582
all you can say
is "I guess so"?

27
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,986
Says give this poor bastard
what he's got coming.

28
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,420
Authentic?

29
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,989
Yeah.

30
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,728
Ten minutes.

31
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,563
Start the count.

32
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,760
<i>All eyes are on the</i>

33
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,895
Can I get you something?

34
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,800
Two shots. Scotch.

35
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,211
Got money on the game?

36
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,514
Nah, spread's terrible.

37
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,015
Here. One
for the road.

38
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,551
No, thanks. Been
sober for three years.

39
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,019
Interesting career.

40
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,988
You do something long enough.

41
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:28,593
You close your eyes, you just can't
think of doing something else.

42
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,004
They found your accounts.

43
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,876
Where'd you spend it?

44
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:57,656
Look, man, I just wanted to start over.
Quit the Agency.

45
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,291
Have your drink.

46
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,983
It could have been anybody
walk through your door.

47
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:29,454
Yeah. But
it was you.

48
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,329
Go clean up your mess.
Three minutes.

49
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,832
Start the count.

50
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,451
No, please, God.

51
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,521
Why did you do that?

52
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,094
Why? Why did
you do that?

53
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,915
Why did you do that?

54
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,266
What a shame.

55
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,271
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

56
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,310
She's just a kid.
Jesus Christ.

57
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,513
The fuck, Emerson?

58
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,558
No loose ends.

59
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,904
<i>How long have you been
out in the field?</i>

60
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:02,374
It should say
there, in the file.

61
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,610
I want to hear what you say.

62
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,246
A long time.

63
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,418
I didn't know you smoked.

64
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,688
When did you start?

65
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,324
Right after I quit drinking.

66
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,359
Why did you stop drinking?

67
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,894
I was a drunk.

68
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:27,499
What would you say is
your current disposition?

69
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,136
How do I feel?

70
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,106
How do you feel about the girl?

71
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,544
She asked a very good question.

72
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,514
Which was?
Why?

73
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:46,418
Well, that's a question
that needs to be asked.

74
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,219
We are not sociopaths.

75
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:52,123
We're vulnerable to qualms of
conscience like anyone else.

76
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:57,796
We face these decisions every
day, and we vote up or down.

77
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:58,697
Like everything else,

78
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:03,635
it has all been distilled
down to zeros and ones.

79
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:10,342
They have asked for me to
describe your emotional state

80
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:14,846
in as detailed
a manner as possible.

81
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:20,085
To determine whether you are
fit to remain in the field.

82
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,823
I hate that it had
to turn out this way.

83
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,929
Me taking care of the girl,
me taking care of the police.

84
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:35,634
What you need, what
we're willing to offer,

85
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,536
is a change of pace.

86
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,072
We have a station
for you to look after.

87
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,574
Blackleg Miner.

88
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,944
One of the smaller terminals.

89
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:46,945
England?
Yeah.

90
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,813
Far the fuck out,
middle of nowhere.

91
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,716
Old American Army base.
Officially it doesn't exist.

92
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:57,222
Unofficially, it's used to broadcast
numbers to our European field agents.

93
00:10:58,958 --> 00:10:59,758
How long?

94
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,626
Until your head is right.

95
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,130
You'll be babysitting
a broadcaster.

96
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,197
Civilian, right?

97
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,199
Yeah, cryptology specialist.

98
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:13,738
And one of the very few people who
can process code at this level.

99
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:19,444
You and another team, alternating shifts.
Three days each.

100
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:23,281
You keep the station safe,
you keep the code safe.

101
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,283
Whatever it takes.

102
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,618
Okay.

103
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,920
Do the job, Emerson.

104
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,723
I don't wanna look like an ass for
sticking my neck out on this one.

105
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:37,262
'Cause I've got nothing left, nothing
to keep you from the wolves.

106
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,073
0-7-3.

107
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,811
<i>4-5-5.</i>

108
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,747
8-1-7.

109
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:36,429
6-9-0-1-0.

110
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,843
Sorry. Little last-minute
broadcast come through.

111
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,178
I'll inform the authorities.

112
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,147
You do that.

113
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,151
Wanna hear my latest theory?

114
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:13,585
Sure.

115
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:16,421
We're coordinating troop
movements in Afghanistan.

116
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,556
Long-term
tactical formations.

117
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,058
Yeah.

118
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:22,961
Illegal missions unsanctioned by the
UN, that's why it's all hush-hush.

119
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:25,330
Could be.

120
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,966
It's good, right?
Yeah.

121
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:30,235
Maybe it's all just
some sort of awful experiment.

122
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,903
Stuff two people in
a box, see how long

123
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,972
it takes for one of
us to kill the other.

124
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,673
That's nice.

125
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,908
Ah, give me something.

126
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,844
We're up two hours
early next shift.

127
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,883
You guys been waiting long?

128
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:45,783
No, you're good.

129
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:46,618
Good shift?
Yeah.

130
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,822
Got to catch up on sitting alone
for 70 hours. It was nice.

131
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:09,207
You know, my contract's up pretty soon.
I was thinking of re-upping.

132
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,409
Nothing else you'd rather do?

133
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,410
No.

134
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,713
I was recruited by a
software company in college.

135
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,849
The kind that
makes apps for phones.

136
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:18,950
What's wrong?
Pay is no good?

137
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:23,554
No, it was great, actually.
Obscene, to be honest with you.

138
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:24,455
Why didn't you do it, then?

139
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:29,794
I don't know. I don't know, I guess
I just felt like it was silly,

140
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:32,063
it wasn't really that
important, you know?

141
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,632
I guess I like the idea
of serving my country.

142
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:38,503
Even if I don't know
exactly what it is I do.

143
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:41,406
What about you? You never
wanted to do anything else?

144
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,340
There comes a time when you

145
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,841
do a thing long enough,
you can't really

146
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,243
imagine doing
anything else, you know?

147
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,946
So, if I stay here, I'm
stuck with you forever?

148
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,081
Yes. Be careful
what you wish for.

149
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,362
You're doing it again,
aren't you?

150
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,163
What?

151
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,132
You have that
look that you get.

152
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:41,632
What look?

153
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,369
You're squinting one eye as if
you're taking aim with a gun.

154
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:47,071
You're gonna be late.
It's horrifying.

155
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,109
I'm sure you're
great fun at parties.

156
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,078
Seriously, you don't
have to think about

157
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,947
killing everyone
that you ever meet.

158
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,349
I don't.
Okay.

159
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,551
So, just for fun, what would
happen if I wasn't here on Monday?

160
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,920
Has there been a
horrible train accident?

161
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,857
No. Train's here.
I'm just not on it.

162
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,558
It wouldn't be fun.

163
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,828
Come on, what would happen?

164
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,798
I'd have to make a phone call.

165
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,266
You'd have to
make a phone call?

166
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,602
I would make a phone call.

167
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,305
No fun.
Company man.

168
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,741
Hi.

169
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,276
How you doing?

170
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,710
Good.

171
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,180
You should have seen
your face back there.

172
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:42,713
What?

173
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:43,948
When I didn't get off
the train right away,

174
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,385
you looked like you were about
to have a heart attack.

175
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,387
How was your weekend?
Good.

176
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,622
I had a great weekend,
thanks for asking.

177
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,759
So you got that text?
Confirming the...

178
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,195
What I already knew.
Yeah, I got it.

179
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,062
Did you get mine?

180
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,263
I was trying to
make a joke about

181
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,398
the White House
Correspondents' dinner,

182
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,800
but my phone spell-checked it into
whorehouse correspondents' dinner.

183
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,635
Spell-checks are
usually pretty accurate.

184
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,103
Right. I'm sure there's
a whorehouse

185
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,605
correspondents'
dinner somewhere.

186
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,141
Somewhere, yeah.

187
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,594
I know, I know, I got it.
No phones inside.

188
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:32,997
Hey, if it were up to me,
I couldn't care less.

189
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:37,401
Gone. Done.
Okay?

190
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,127
Should be out by now.

191
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:03,928
Yeah.

192
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,964
Probably just got
a last-minute broadcast.

193
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:13,971
What?

194
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:16,674
Nothing.
One sec.

195
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,635
Ah!

196
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,111
No... Ah!

197
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,983
I can't hear.

198
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,585
Shh.

199
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,388
Okay.
Eardrums.

200
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,760
Stay quiet, okay?

201
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:43,928
Okay.

202
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,896
Stay quiet.

203
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,246
Stay here.
Be quiet, okay?

204
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:16,180
Katherine.

205
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,882
We're clear.
Are you sure?

206
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:22,586
We'd know by now if
somebody else were in here.

207
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,288
Whose hand is that?

208
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,156
I don't know.

209
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,392
Can you hear?
Yeah.

210
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,629
If they know the code from before,
they're gonna come back in.

211
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,130
They're gonna use it again.

212
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,031
No, the codes
change every shift.

213
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:38,435
They could have had David and
Meredith's code but not ours.

214
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,137
Where are they?

215
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,840
Take a deep breath.

216
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,346
We're gonna walk. We're
gonna call for help. Okay?

217
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:08,532
"Cardiff, Aberdeen, Glasgow,
Belfast, Oxford, Slough."

218
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:19,643
"Cardiff, Aberdeen, Glasgow,
Belfast, Oxford, Slough."

219
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,045
<i>Operator.</i>

220
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:23,781
Blackleg Miner Station.
<i>Go ahead.</i>

221
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:25,115
The station's been compromised.

222
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,851
Requesting
immediate evacuation.

223
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,155
<i>One moment.</i>

224
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,358
<i>Evac authorized.</i>
<i>ETA?</i>

225
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:40,297
<i>Four hours. For now, standard protocol.
Secure location. Retire asset.</i>

226
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:41,699
Repeat.

227
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:44,001
<i>The code has been compromised.</i>

228
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:46,837
<i>Retire your broadcaster.</i>

229
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,943
<i>Did you copy that?</i>

230
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,245
Got it.

231
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,883
What? What'd
they say?

232
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:02,820
Four hours.
Sit tight.

233
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,825
Shh.

234
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,095
Did you hear that?

235
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,020
They're drilling through.

236
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,822
Let's go
check the security cameras.

237
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:42,660
Find out what happened
to David and Meredith.

238
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,067
Shit.

239
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,735
All the cameras are down.

240
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,070
Audio's on a separate file.

241
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:55,773
Yeah.
Pull it up.

242
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,009
Here.

243
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,753
Nothing.

244
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,588
What time was that?

245
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,956
One hour ago.

246
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,792
Earlier.

247
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,497
<i>Fuck you!</i>

248
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,266
<i>Do you wanna be a fucking hero?</i>

249
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,668
Go back further.

250
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,770
<i>We just gotta hold</i>
<i>out a couple of hours</i>

251
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,672
<i>till Emerson gets</i>
<i>here and then I hope...</i>

252
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,342
<i>- Quiet!</i>
<i>- Get off of me!</i>

253
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:33,444
<i>Where is she?</i>

254
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:34,111
<i>Fuck you!</i>

255
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:39,450
<i>You go get her. Tell her to come out.
Tell her to come out right now!</i>

256
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,254
Take a fucking seat!

257
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,360
We know you have to open
the door from the inside.

258
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:54,431
Can you get her to do that for us?
It'll be a lot easier.

259
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,833
Fuck you.

260
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,169
I need to get inside
the broadcast room.

261
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,238
I need the girl
to open the door.

262
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,974
I need her to take care
of some numbers for me.

263
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:07,211
<i>Now this is something</i>
<i>only she can do.</i>

264
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:09,646
<i>And I'm kinda on</i>
<i>a tight schedule.</i>

265
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:12,950
They didn't know about
the change in schedule.

266
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:15,486
We got here early.

267
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,357
I know about you and the girl.

268
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,025
We know, okay?

269
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:26,263
Now we can offer you two a
way out, a way through.

270
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:31,502
And if you do what we say, if you
help us, we won't have to hurt her.

271
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,206
There's no need for violence.

272
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:41,044
Violence is what got us all
in this place to begin with.

273
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:46,784
<i>This is the end of violence for us.
This is a new beginning.</i>

274
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,352
It's a partnership.

275
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:54,625
And it starts by you getting
her to open that door.

276
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:57,461
<i>Fuck you.</i>

277
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,430
Oh, shit.
Your leg.

278
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,233
Oh, my God.

279
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,336
I don't even feel anything.

280
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:08,505
That's usually a bad sign.

281
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:11,942
You always know
what to say to a girl.

282
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:17,548
Up.

283
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,350
You have training in this
kind of a thing, right?

284
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:20,951
What?

285
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:23,153
Field surgery?
Dressing wounds?

286
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:23,720
Yeah.

287
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:29,960
I mean, it's not my area of
expertise but I know a little bit.

288
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,029
Okay.

289
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,130
Is all this blood normal?

290
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:37,000
Well, you have a piece
of truck in your leg.

291
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,936
No way is a joke gonna make
me feel more comfortable

292
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:41,772
in your ability to
not kill me right now.

293
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:43,373
Grit your teeth.

294
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,912
Looks like we
missed the artery.

295
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:50,347
But it's gonna be okay, right?

296
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,515
You could still bleed out.

297
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,952
Emerson, lie
to a girl, will you?

298
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:57,888
Bite down. I think
it's starting to hurt.

299
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:58,822
Bite.

300
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,243
That was bizarre.

301
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,051
Emerson!

302
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,821
Emerson!

303
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,123
Yeah.

304
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,293
I thought you left me.

305
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,368
How long was I out?

306
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,037
Little while. Not long.

307
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,973
We were ambushed.

308
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,475
Yeah.

309
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:43,513
So, what? What? They wanted
to stop the broadcasts?

310
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:44,981
You know as much as I do.

311
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:48,351
Yeah, but we didn't
do anything wrong.

312
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:51,221
Right? We were ambushed.

313
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:51,922
Sit back down.

314
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:55,058
All the audio files are there. We
had nothing to do with it. So...

315
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,662
They can't blame
us for anything.

316
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:00,864
Why are you looking
at me like that?

317
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,833
We're fine. We were ambushed.
Calm down.

318
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:06,203
I am calm. But what
are we gonna do next?

319
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:07,971
Stop walking
around on your leg.

320
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,339
I'm fine. What
do we do next?

321
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,608
Just tell me what we do now.

322
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,516
<i>Timetable updated.</i>
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

323
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:22,085
<i>We'll have you out of there
in less than two hours.</i>

324
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:25,856
<i>Has everything been</i>
<i>taken care of at your end?</i>

325
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,191
I can't confirm that.

326
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:30,527
<i>Is there a problem?</i>

327
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:31,695
No.

328
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:33,497
<i>Get it done, immediately.</i>

329
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,299
What?

330
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,334
Two hours.

331
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:41,571
Ugh, this drilling
is driving me nuts.

332
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:44,875
I wanna find
David and Meredith.

333
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,927
You sure no one
else could be in here?

334
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,223
What?
Nothing.

335
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:34,724
I was just thinking they wanted

336
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,059
something in
the broadcast room.

337
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,961
Gotta get over there.

338
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,130
Think they got
what they came for?

339
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:41,965
Let's find out.

340
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,110
It's pretty standard activity.

341
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:58,148
Two broadcasts yesterday.
Three last night.

342
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,885
There's gotta be something.

343
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,119
What? What
do you got?

344
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:06,389
Fifteen broadcasts
this afternoon.

345
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,757
What?

346
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:08,525
Just 20 minutes apart.

347
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:11,728
Whoever broke in here didn't
do it to stop the broadcasts.

348
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,930
Well, that's a good
thing, right?

349
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,734
Katherine, when you
send a broadcast

350
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,637
you're sending out these numbers
to the agents in the field

351
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,439
to deliver specific
assignments they cannot

352
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:23,940
trust to normal
communication lines.

353
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:26,142
Do you know what that means?

354
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,146
Fifteen broadcasts.

355
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,984
Fifteen assignments.

356
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:35,318
Unauthorized.

357
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,122
Assassinations, bombings.
Could be anything.

358
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,091
Murders?

359
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,366
Gonna fix it.

360
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,869
Here, what does it say?

361
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,437
Can't read that.

362
00:37:56,073 --> 00:38:01,378
Agents in the field carry, like,
one-time notebooks, like pads.

363
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,446
Each page is a new cypher.

364
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,614
When you broadcast something,

365
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,049
the agent matches
up the first set

366
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:07,684
of numbers to
the page in the notebook.

367
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:09,286
<i>Now he knows he's</i>
<i>using this page,</i>

368
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:11,021
<i>and this page only,</i>
<i>to decode the message.</i>

369
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:14,057
<i>When he's done,</i>
<i>he destroys the page.</i>

370
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:17,627
So we send another broadcast
to cancel this one.

371
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,563
Every cypher's
a one-time deal.

372
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,232
Totally random.

373
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:24,034
Completely impossible
to crack the code

374
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:25,835
unless you have
the original cypher.

375
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:29,105
That changes with every shift.

376
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,707
So we need the cypher?

377
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,275
Yes, we need that cypher.

378
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,423
<i>As much as it</i>
<i>seems like we're here</i>

379
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:49,125
<i>to hurt you,</i>
<i>to kill you, I assure you,</i>

380
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:50,293
<i>both of you,</i>

381
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,162
<i>that's the</i>
<i>worst-case scenario.</i>

382
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:55,765
Must have left
the computer running.

383
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,174
It doesn't scare me.

384
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:06,142
Shut the fuck up!
Back off!

385
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:10,313
Please. Let me
rephrase that.

386
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,217
You think someone like me
is afraid of being shot?

387
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,353
Back off!

388
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:20,724
Meredith. This is
between you and I.

389
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:25,328
The rest of these guys, they don't matter.
This is just you and me.

390
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,397
And a choice.

391
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:33,269
You're shaking now.
You're getting angry.

392
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:36,272
You're letting your emotions get
the better of the situation.

393
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:40,210
The adrenaline is
really kicking in.

394
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:44,814
<i>But what I know, the reason
that I'm not shaking</i>

395
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:48,485
<i>is because this is a choice</i>
<i>not dictated by emotion.</i>

396
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:53,223
<i>This is logic.</i>
<i>Pure, simple.</i>

397
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:57,794
My boy over there is rated 4th
in the world on the Glock 30.

398
00:39:57,796 --> 00:39:59,963
You know what that means?

399
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,801
What's it mean?

400
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:06,936
It means I could
shoot you from Texas.

401
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:10,907
Now, that's, of course, an
exaggeration but the point stands.

402
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,811
He knows what he's doing.
He's a professional.

403
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:18,481
And you're you.

404
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,452
You've already dropped the gun.

405
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:28,925
<i>Because this is a choice within a
very strict set of parameters.</i>

406
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,293
<i>Right now you're in control.</i>

407
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:32,362
<i>What you don't wanna do</i>
<i>is put him in control.</i>

408
00:40:32,364 --> 00:40:36,699
<i>Don't give him the choice.</i>
<i>That way is death.</i>

409
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:43,706
That way is the unconditional
end to future choice.

410
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:49,379
That's it.
Good girl.

411
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,484
I know, I know.

412
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:57,387
It's always a tough
lesson to learn,

413
00:40:57,389 --> 00:41:03,293
<i>to realize that you don't have
the stomach to do what's needed.</i>

414
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:05,228
Don't kill her.

415
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,930
Of course not.

416
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,566
But you, on the other hand...

417
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:10,967
No!

418
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,269
Don't! Please, please.

419
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,973
No! Please, please.

420
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:31,654
David!

421
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,757
Please!

422
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,139
No!

423
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:51,474
You'll do exactly what we want.

424
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,943
You'll broadcast my
numbers because now

425
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:56,713
you know every
choice has a consequence.

426
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:03,119
<i>Stop it!</i>
<i>Stop it!</i>

427
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:05,188
<i>Stop it!</i>

428
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,691
My God.

429
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,362
Try the other zones.

430
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:30,313
Who's in the basement?

431
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:34,450
Let's see what's down there.

432
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,076
We're clear.

433
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,075
My God.

434
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,987
He only fired two shots.

435
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,907
Oh, my God, it's David.

436
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,610
Oh, my God!

437
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:11,848
They must have thought
he was dead. Bled out.

438
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:15,051
He knew there was
a gun hidden down here.

439
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,720
You still with me?

440
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:19,355
Yeah, feel nauseous.

441
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:20,690
Yeah, well, puke
if you have to.

442
00:44:20,692 --> 00:44:22,191
I haven't puked since college.

443
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:24,327
Keep talking.
Where did you go?

444
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,230
Brown.
Yeah, how long?

445
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:27,830
Two years.

446
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:30,600
Before you dropped out, huh?

447
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,971
There you are.

448
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,255
They're looking for this.

449
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:57,293
Mainframe's connected
to the computer.

450
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,063
So whatever's on this...

451
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:02,565
You said the codes
were impossible to crack.

452
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:03,633
Unless you have
the original cypher.

453
00:45:03,635 --> 00:45:06,436
But whatever they're looking
for, it's on this, so can you?

454
00:45:06,438 --> 00:45:09,572
Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it.

455
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,245
Who's this?

456
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:24,353
Oh, it's the Director of
Clandestine Operations Overseas.

457
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:29,859
Somebody's boss's boss's boss.
Somebody high up in the company.

458
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:31,527
Director Atwater.

459
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,863
Director Collins.

460
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,631
Templeman.

461
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,600
Keep going.

462
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,635
Yeah, these are
people being groomed

463
00:45:39,637 --> 00:45:42,138
for top slots in
the corporation.

464
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,807
Go back, go back.

465
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:48,644
I know that man.
That's my fucking boss.

466
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,181
Fifteen dossiers.

467
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:54,584
Fifteen broadcasts.

468
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:57,220
There it is.

469
00:45:57,222 --> 00:45:59,989
If I wanted to cripple the
system in one fell swoop,

470
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:03,025
these would be
the 15 I'd start with.

471
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:03,793
You kill these men today,

472
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:06,696
you won't recognize the world
when you wake up in the morning.

473
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:08,498
But they've already
sent the broadcasts.

474
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,899
I mean, what the hell
do they want with us?

475
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:14,904
They wanna kill us. Make sure you
don't cancel the broadcasts.

476
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:19,142
Grab that.
Let's go.

477
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,398
Here.

478
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,369
That's all the information from
the laptop, in case, uh...

479
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:49,305
I don't know, in case
we don't get out of here.

480
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,840
Drink that.

481
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:52,475
"Of course we'll get
out of here, Katherine."

482
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:54,710
"Don't you worry
about a thing."

483
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,951
You ever get used to it?

484
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:02,885
Used to what?

485
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:07,323
Bodies. Dead people.
Seeing them.

486
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:07,757
No.

487
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:10,626
They never seem to stay dead.
How's it going over there?

488
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:12,762
There's stuff on here,
but it's password protected.

489
00:47:12,764 --> 00:47:14,897
I know, but can you open it?

490
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:17,466
I don't know.
I'm trying.

491
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:24,040
How do we know all this mayhem
hasn't already happened?

492
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:25,808
We don't.

493
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:30,780
Good. Just keep working.

494
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,350
Fuck.

495
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:40,756
Can you just talk to me?

496
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:41,958
Yeah, what do you
wanna talk about?

497
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,329
Anything. Just regular stuff. Like
what normal people talk about.

498
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:48,064
Not really my
strong suit, Katherine.

499
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:49,365
I'll start.

500
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:53,402
How do you know I
dropped out of college?

501
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:55,872
Oh, that was just
a lucky guess.

502
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,909
Grabbed my file or something?

503
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,144
You fit a profile.

504
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:02,678
Of what?

505
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,884
Civilian broadcasters have a certain,
you know, personality trait.

506
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:08,551
Keep working.

507
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:13,623
Well, I can't work in silence, so you
might as well just entertain me.

508
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,857
Okay.

509
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:16,525
A troubled childhood
with an emphasis

510
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:18,461
on extreme emotional
loss or fatigue.

511
00:48:18,463 --> 00:48:20,329
Death of a parent.
Sometimes sexual abuse.

512
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:21,864
Lack of a strong authority
figure in adolescence.

513
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:27,136
Low self-esteem resulting in few
permanent relationships. Defensive.

514
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:28,304
Rebellious.
Highly intelligent.

515
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:33,242
Susceptible to being stuck in one
position, environment or occupation

516
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,477
for long periods of time.

517
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:37,146
Wow... Yeah,
you're terrible at this.

518
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:38,381
How about your profile?

519
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:41,584
Indifferent and emotionally
detached from reality.

520
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,219
Inability to communicate
with any other

521
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:44,520
human being on
the face of this Earth.

522
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:47,556
Willing to sit silently in one
place for hours at a time.

523
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:52,762
Make sure that you have a plan to
kill every person that you ever meet.

524
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,531
No. Close.

525
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:56,465
No, I had a stable childhood

526
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:59,835
but with an underlying desire to break
free from control or authority.

527
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:01,304
Restless.
Sense of self-entitlement.

528
00:49:01,306 --> 00:49:05,308
Striking lack of empathy or
compassion for other people.

529
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,976
Bordering between autism...

530
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,678
Stop.

531
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:13,282
You know, I, um,
didn't always do this.

532
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:16,285
This is my first
station assignment.

533
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:21,991
I was on the other
end of the numbers.

534
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:28,531
Looking at nine million
black-book tax dollars.

535
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,837
Recruited me
straight out of college.

536
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:37,773
Said it was the best
opportunity I'd ever have.

537
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:43,045
Told me I'd do special
things, important things.

538
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,283
Well, you're worth more than

539
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:49,452
what some bureaucrat wrote down

540
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:52,254
on a piece of
paper 20 years ago.

541
00:49:52,256 --> 00:49:53,689
Hmm...

542
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,526
All they're really talking
about is what's real. Reality.

543
00:49:57,528 --> 00:50:01,464
They know how to use it.
They're good at it.

544
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,600
Why not quit?

545
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:07,069
Yeah. Yeah.

546
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:09,372
I knew a guy once, and he
decided he wanted to quit.

547
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:14,043
He squirreled away money for about
20 years and he opened up a bar

548
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:16,779
and wanted to
create a new life,

549
00:50:16,781 --> 00:50:21,350
and he survived
about 37 months.

550
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,918
They killed him?

551
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,687
No, I did.

552
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,962
See if you can get
into those files.

553
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,444
<i>...Emerson gets here.</i>

554
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:00,990
<i>Get off me! Get the fuck off!
Get it off me!</i>

555
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:04,960
How much longer?

556
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:05,661
Little while still.

557
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:07,863
<i>Go on, David,</i>
<i>tell her to come out.</i>

558
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:10,132
<i>Tell her to come out right now!</i>

559
00:51:10,134 --> 00:51:11,700
<i>Fuck you!</i>

560
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:14,103
<i>Get up there.</i>

561
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:17,006
<i>Do you wanna be a fucking hero?</i>

562
00:51:17,008 --> 00:51:19,842
<i>Get off!</i>
<i>Get the fuck off me!</i>

563
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:25,815
<i>I don't know how they got in.</i>

564
00:51:25,817 --> 00:51:27,216
<i>I mean, how can</i>
<i>they have gotten</i>

565
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:30,086
<i>the door code?</i>
<i>It changes every shift.</i>

566
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:33,022
<i>Unless someone...</i>

567
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,426
They knew the code
and I told Mere...

568
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,695
I told Meredith to lock herself
inside the broadcast room

569
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:41,931
to broadcast over
the emergency channel.

570
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:42,798
Fuck.

571
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,503
If anyone's even listening, if
it's even still on the air...

572
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:52,274
<i>They've cut into all our other
secure lines of communication.</i>

573
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:57,079
<i>I don't know how. I mean,
who could know that much?</i>

574
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:58,647
Even the one-way
operator line,

575
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:00,950
I didn't even think
that was possible.

576
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,518
Wait.

577
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,487
What did he just say?

578
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:06,722
<i>Even the one-way</i>
<i>operator line,</i>

579
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:08,357
<i>I didn't even think</i>
<i>that was possible.</i>

580
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:10,726
They cut
into the operator line?

581
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:14,763
You did speak to someone on the phone.
You spoke to the operator.

582
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:15,231
Yes.

583
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:17,199
I swear to God, if you were
pretending to talk to someone...

584
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:20,603
Katherine, I gave him the code.
He verified the code.

585
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:23,973
Yeah, but did you verify him?

586
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:34,216
"Cardiff, Aberdeen, Glasgow,
Belfast, Liverpool, Slough."

587
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,657
<i>Operator.</i>

588
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,126
That wasn't the right code.

589
00:52:44,128 --> 00:52:45,194
<i>What?</i>

590
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:47,796
What I just called in.

591
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:50,232
It wasn't the right code.

592
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:55,838
<i>Tell me you killed the girl</i>
<i>before you figured that out.</i>

593
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,340
What?

594
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:18,527
Fuck! They got to
the emergency phones.

595
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:20,496
Just let me think.

596
00:53:20,498 --> 00:53:22,798
No one even knows
we're in trouble, do they?

597
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,465
No, they don't.

598
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:25,734
There has to be a safety
measure, right? No.

599
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:27,436
Something or someone?

600
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:28,537
There's nothing.

601
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:29,838
Someone who
cancels the broadcast

602
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,507
when something
like this happens.

603
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:33,609
There's no one.

604
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:40,816
There has to be
some kind of back-up,

605
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:42,318
like an emergency back-up...

606
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,619
Something like
this doesn't happen.

607
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:45,754
Seventy years, the code's
never been breached.

608
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:46,956
Somebody has to be
out there who can...

609
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:50,626
Katherine, there's nothing
but the goddamn numbers!

610
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:04,106
If we do our job, we get out
of here alive. I promise.

611
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,546
<i>You kill her</i>
<i>for me, I let you live.</i>

612
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:13,415
No.

613
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:16,218
<i>We've gone to a lot of trouble
here with these broadcasts.</i>

614
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,087
<i>We can't leave</i>
<i>anything to chance.</i>

615
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:20,656
<i>We can't let the girl</i>
<i>cancel the broadcasts.</i>

616
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:24,560
<i>She's the only one</i>
<i>who can undo what's been done.</i>

617
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:27,563
<i>You understand that,</i>
<i>you're not a fool.</i>

618
00:54:27,565 --> 00:54:28,264
Go fuck yourself.

619
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:30,966
<i>Look, your bosses won't let her live.
She knows too much.</i>

620
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:34,270
<i>Either you or me or the
Agency pulls the trigger.</i>

621
00:54:34,272 --> 00:54:36,772
<i>No matter what, she</i>
<i>doesn't make it out alive.</i>

622
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:40,009
You know a lot
about this business.

623
00:54:40,011 --> 00:54:43,045
<i>What's the problem?</i>
<i>What do you care?</i>

624
00:54:43,047 --> 00:54:46,448
<i>Like you haven't done it</i>
<i>a hundred times before.</i>

625
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,218
<i>We've almost drilled</i>
<i>through your door anyways.</i>

626
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,688
<i>Might as well</i>
<i>save your own life.</i>

627
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:56,925
<i>What's she worth</i>
<i>to you? She's nobody.</i>

628
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:11,273
<i>Fuck.</i>
<i>If anyone's even listening,</i>

629
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:14,343
<i>if it's even</i>
<i>still on the air...</i>

630
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:22,051
<i>I couldn't take the shot.</i>

631
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,791
I couldn't do it.

632
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,660
<i>How could I do it?</i>

633
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:36,999
He said
he couldn't take the shot.

634
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,837
No, he couldn't.

635
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,273
What does that mean, Emerson?

636
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,608
What do you think it means?

637
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,510
It means that there are
no other safety measures.

638
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:51,947
That David was
the safety measure.

639
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,216
Yeah.

640
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:58,287
Means that you're
the safety measure.

641
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:03,192
And all this time I thought
you were protecting me.

642
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:10,032
I knew you looked at me funny. I
knew you fucking looked at me funny.

643
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,036
Liar.

644
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:16,705
I should have
listened to myself.

645
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:17,873
Where are you going?

646
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:18,841
Nowhere! Where
am I gonna go?

647
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:21,009
I'm stuck here with you. Yeah.

648
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:21,810
And what have you got, huh?

649
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:24,146
What have you got outside of this?
Do you have a life?

650
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:25,147
How could that possibly matter?

651
00:56:25,149 --> 00:56:26,515
What do you mean
"how does it matter"?

652
00:56:26,517 --> 00:56:27,616
It means everything.
What is...

653
00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:31,720
What have you got? You've got nothing
to live for except for this!

654
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:33,055
Mmm-hmm...
This is all you've got.

655
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:35,424
You've got your protocol.
You've got your numbers.

656
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:37,860
You're on the other side
of the fucking numbers.

657
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:39,895
And you read them and
you take their money.

658
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,163
You think you're not
a part of this, huh?

659
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:43,999
Do you think you can fuck
around with these people?

660
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:47,569
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing here?

661
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:51,807
You're in it.

662
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:55,511
You asked for it
and you're in it.

663
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,014
Here, locked and loaded.

664
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:00,215
Safety's off.
It's good to go.

665
00:57:00,217 --> 00:57:01,316
I don't want your fucking gun.

666
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:05,888
If I was gonna kill you, I would
have done it a long time ago.

667
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:11,353
<i>You'll do exactly what we want.</i>

668
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:13,889
<i>You'll broadcast my</i>
<i>numbers because now</i>

669
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:16,992
<i>you know every</i>
<i>choice has a consequence.</i>

670
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:21,997
<i>You'll do exactly what we want.</i>

671
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:24,600
<i>You'll broadcast my</i>
<i>numbers because now</i>

672
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:28,237
<i>you know every</i>
<i>choice has a consequence.</i>

673
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:38,046
My cell phone.

674
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:42,684
My cell phone's
in your glove-box.

675
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,087
We can use it to call for help.

676
00:58:45,089 --> 00:58:48,524
Doesn't help much with the guys
waiting outside that door.

677
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:51,693
Yeah, but there are three
voices on the recording, right?

678
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:56,965
The one who attacked us, the one
who was dead in the basement.

679
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:02,504
And one guy who will
watch outside. Maybe.

680
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,707
Yeah.

681
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:13,982
Lock yourself in.

682
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:17,319
It's the only secure
room we got left.

683
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,372
<i>Is she dead?</i>

684
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:37,906
Yes, it's done.

685
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:40,742
<i>Come upstairs. Leave the
door open and drive away.</i>

686
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:43,312
<i>Welcome to early retirement.</i>

687
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:49,911
God, Meredith.
Please.

688
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:07,729
Oh, my God.

689
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,406
Oh, my God, these are them.

690
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:01,183
Meredith.

691
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,588
0-1-6-6

692
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:13,195
4-4-3-1-7-8-7-0.

693
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:29,978
8-8-2-8-4-5-7-7

694
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:33,415
6-6-8-9.

695
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:00,208
Fuck, no!

696
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,711
7-7.

697
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:05,947
Okay.

698
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,841
I unlocked the cypher.

699
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:32,921
I got the cypher.

700
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:38,693
It was just one... One
more, one more broadcast.

701
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:40,095
Forget the broadcast.

702
01:06:40,097 --> 01:06:42,430
Ow, oh...

703
01:06:42,432 --> 01:06:45,667
No, no...

704
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,072
Come here, come here.

705
01:06:52,743 --> 01:06:53,842
It's seven.

706
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:55,410
It doesn't matter.

707
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:57,145
Please...

708
01:06:57,147 --> 01:06:58,480
What?

709
01:06:58,482 --> 01:07:03,651
It's 7-4-6-3.

710
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:05,420
Can you remember?

711
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:12,827
Everything's all right.
It's all right. It's okay.

712
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,233
Go, go...

713
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:20,402
Okay.

714
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:25,540
Can you keep your
pressure on it? Okay.

715
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:18,960
Did we do it?

716
01:08:18,962 --> 01:08:20,495
I think so.

717
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:22,330
Will I die?

718
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:24,699
No, you can live
a long time like this.

719
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:29,370
I need a doctor.

720
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:33,608
Can you take the bullet out?

721
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:37,479
It's a lot different than taking a
piece of scrap out of your leg.

722
01:08:37,481 --> 01:08:38,880
Oh!

723
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:47,489
Here.

724
01:08:47,491 --> 01:08:50,625
This is gonna take
the pain away for a while.

725
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:00,034
Wait.

726
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:08,243
I'm gonna wake up, right?

727
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:13,014
I've seen four guys get shot in the gut.
Every one of them lived.

728
01:09:13,016 --> 01:09:16,918
Not the bullet. You.

729
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,087
You wouldn't...

730
01:09:19,089 --> 01:09:19,888
What?

731
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:23,158
You wouldn't do
that to me, would you?

732
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:26,794
No.

733
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:41,903
<i>Somerset Textiles.</i>

734
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:43,571
Blackleg Miner.
Under duress.

735
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,073
<i>Please hold.</i>

736
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,377
Blackleg Miner,
what's going on?

737
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:51,012
Terminal was compromised.

738
01:10:51,014 --> 01:10:53,114
What's your status?

739
01:10:53,116 --> 01:10:53,781
Terminal secure.

740
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:58,253
I knew you wouldn't let me down.
Numbers secure?

741
01:10:58,621 --> 01:10:59,921
Of course.

742
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,723
That's all that matters.

743
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:03,358
Yeah.

744
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:05,593
<i>And the girl?</i>

745
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,629
All assets retired.

746
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,497
She's dead?

747
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:11,566
Yes.

748
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:14,335
All right, then.

749
01:14:18,254 --> 01:14:20,121
Get out! Get out of the car!

750
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:23,658
Hey, don't shoot, don't shoot.
I got money.

751
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:24,525
I don't want
your fucking money.

752
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:26,761
Help me get her in the car.
We gotta get

753
01:14:26,763 --> 01:14:28,429
into town. We need to
get to a hospital.

754
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:29,664
What happened to her?
She's shot?

755
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:32,834
Shot? Out here? Help me!
Help me get her in.

756
01:14:32,836 --> 01:14:37,438
Okay, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

757
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:41,309
What happened?

758
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:42,710
Is she dead?

759
01:14:42,712 --> 01:14:44,879
She will be if you
don't hurry the fuck up.

760
01:14:44,881 --> 01:14:49,150
I understand that.
I'm not a fool.

761
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:52,787
<i>You understand that,</i>
<i>you're not a fool.</i>

762
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:09,937
Who are you working for?

763
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:19,580
I used to work for the same righteous
pricks who twisted your life.

764
01:15:19,582 --> 01:15:26,754
Now I work for the other side. Just
as twisted but they pay a lot more.

765
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:29,790
They break us, you know.

766
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:33,294
Turn us into
these awful things.

767
01:15:33,296 --> 01:15:36,597
Broken pieces.
They push us.

768
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:38,799
Make us into men we're not.

769
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:42,470
And then complain
when we no longer function.

770
01:15:42,472 --> 01:15:45,740
They think we should
live like this is normal.

771
01:15:45,742 --> 01:15:50,111
Like this is how we should
behave, how we should think.

772
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:52,547
And our reward for this life?

773
01:15:52,549 --> 01:15:54,715
We try to run away
and they kill us because

774
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:56,684
of what they
forced inside our heads.

775
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:59,720
You think men like
that deserve to live?

776
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:04,025
They deserve everything
they got coming.

777
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:05,626
Maybe.

778
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,630
Did you stop the broadcasts?

779
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,667
Yeah.

780
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:16,037
Why?

781
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:21,609
Some fleeting virtue in not
being a mass murderer.

782
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:28,416
I take it you're
not a religious man?

783
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:31,218
You don't believe
in a guiding light?

784
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,153
No.

785
01:16:32,155 --> 01:16:36,657
You're like me, then.
Floundering in wet shit.

786
01:16:36,659 --> 01:16:38,192
Yeah.

787
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:42,597
How long do you think
we can go on like this?

788
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:07,168
Still at this, are we?

789
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:17,645
So, you told me she was dead.

790
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:20,981
Look, tell me.

791
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:25,119
Burnt down,
a man's worth $4.40.

792
01:20:25,121 --> 01:20:27,555
Excuse me?
That's what you said.

793
01:20:27,557 --> 01:20:28,823
When?

794
01:20:28,825 --> 01:20:29,957
In the car.

795
01:20:29,959 --> 01:20:33,994
When all's said and done, you
know, carbon and minerals.

796
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:37,598
A human being's worth
less than five bucks.

797
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,201
I said that?
Uh-huh.

798
01:20:40,203 --> 01:20:43,604
Well, you know me,
I talk a lot of shit.

799
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:44,905
But if you say I
said it, then I suppose

800
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:47,208
I should believe you.
What about it?

801
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:48,509
Hmm...

802
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:51,579
We walk.
Both of us.

803
01:20:54,916 --> 01:21:00,287
Well, you might walk but her...
That's impossible.

804
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:01,255
She knows too much.

805
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:07,094
She's got the codes. She's got the cypher.
She's compromised.

806
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:10,030
It's gotta stop.

807
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:11,765
I'll get you
a prescription for Ativan.

808
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:13,767
That will stop your
conscience bothering you.

809
01:21:13,769 --> 01:21:16,704
Yeah. Well, take
a look at that.

810
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:20,040
It's a copy of the broadcasts.

811
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:22,576
The ones she stopped.

812
01:21:22,578 --> 01:21:27,281
Number 14 might be
of interest. It's you.

813
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:32,786
She took a bullet for you. Gotta
be worth more than five bucks.

814
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:46,433
What do you want?

815
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:49,169
Give me a week.
Ten days.

816
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:52,706
And I'll find your
bodies at the station?

817
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:54,942
You'll find enough.

818
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:08,822
Start the count.

819
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:15,596
We were never here.
