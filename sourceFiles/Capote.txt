1
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,131
Hello?

2
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,510
Nancy?

3
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,106
Exactly.

4
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,859
But at least be honest about the facts.

5
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,111
-That's what l'm saying.
-Who's honest?

6
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,613
l'm honest.

7
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,698
l am honest about what l write about.

8
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:23,285
l'll let you know if it's autobiographical,
or if it's about me, or if it's not.

9
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:28,040
And l find autobiographical stories
at this juncture of my life to be quite boring.

10
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,047
...say l'm one thing,
but actually you're another thing.

11
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,049
l think being true to who you are
is important.

12
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,135
l'm not saying you need to be
psychoanalytical about the whole mess.

13
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,387
-But don't be afraid.
-Yeah, l... But don't be afraid.

14
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,724
l had lunch with Jimmy Baldwin
the other day.

15
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,435
-How is he?
-He's a lovely man.

16
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,647
And he told me the plot of his new book.

17
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:56,902
And he said to me, "But l just want to make
sure it's not one of those problem novels."

18
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,320
And l said, "Jimmy,

19
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:02,407
"your novel's about a Negro homosexual
who's in love with a Jew.

20
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,078
"Wouldn't you call that a problem?"

21
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,833
And he looked at me and he laughed
because he knew l was right.

22
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,586
l'm saying, you know,
if you're gonna write something like that

23
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,922
at least be honest why you're writing it.

24
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,674
Can't we just be honest?

25
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,426
Well, l don't think
you actually need to be honest.

26
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,596
But don't come asking
some white man from the South

27
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,933
whether your book
about a black man fucking some Jew,

28
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,851
when they're both of the same sex,

29
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,186
is an issue!

30
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,688
Don't ask me that!

31
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,189
Oh, no, it's not an issue, Jimmy.

32
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,359
Everyone's gonna be quite pleased
with that topic.

33
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,611
So how about you, Truman?
Do you admit it?

34
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,197
Well, l'm not nearly that controversial.

35
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,784
l'm not! l'm not! l am not.

36
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,036
l'm not nearly that controversial.

37
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,538
Oh, come on.

38
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,967
Hi. lt's Truman for William Shawn, please.

39
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,598
Have you read the article
about the killings in Kansas

40
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,184
in the front section of The New York Times?

41
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:55,103
l think that's what l want to write about.

42
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,319
l want to go tonight.

43
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,840
-l figured you'd missed it.
-l'm sorry.

44
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,469
That's all right. l thought
l was heading to Kansas by myself.

45
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,556
God, l'm glad you agreed to come.

46
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,059
You're the only one l know
with the qualifications

47
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:37,104
to be both a research assistant
and a personal bodyguard.

48
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,522
Thank you.

49
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,732
Now l'm nervous.

50
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,942
Yes?

51
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,237
Mr. Truman Capote
and Miss Nelle Harper Lee?

52
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,072
-That's us.
-Where would you like these, sir?

53
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,866
You can put that right there
between the doors.

54
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,284
What all did you bring?

55
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,828
Just a few things.

56
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,374
-Thank you greatly, sir.
-Thank you.

57
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,792
You're welcome.

58
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,212
lt's an honor to have you with us, sir,

59
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,756
and l hope you won't mind me saying,

60
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,426
but l thought your last book
was even better than the first.

61
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,677
Thank you.

62
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,305
l mean, just when you think
they've gotten as good as they can get.

63
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,724
-Thank you very much.
-Ma'am.

64
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,733
You're pathetic.

65
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,154
-What?
-You paid him to say that.

66
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,074
You paid him to say that.

67
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,329
How did you know?

68
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,707
"Just when you think
they've gotten as good as they can get?"

69
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,876
l thought that was a good line.

70
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,547
-Do you think that was too much?
-Yeah, a bit.

71
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,432
Your keys.

72
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,601
-Sign here, please.
-Thank you.

73
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,740
Alvin Dewey,

74
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,744
Kansas Bureau of lnvestigation.

75
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,667
KBl.

76
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,008
Hi. l'm looking for Alvin Dewey.

77
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,141
Hi.

78
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,604
Mr. Dewey.
Truman Capote, from The New Yorker.

79
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,984
-Bergdorf's.
-Sorry?

80
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,861
-The scarf.
-Oh.

81
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,947
-Nice.
-Thank you.

82
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:56,785
Mr. Dewey, l wonder when we could
arrange an interview, some time to talk.

83
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,122
About what?

84
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,417
Well, we're not looking
for any inside information.

85
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,963
You know, l don't care one way or another
if you catch whoever did this.

86
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:12,175
l'm writing an article on how
the Clutter killings are affecting the town.

87
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,886
You know, how you all are bearing up.

88
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,389
l care.

89
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,727
-Excuse me?
-l care.

90
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,981
l care a great deal
if we catch whoever did this.

91
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,191
Oh, l see.

92
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,486
-As do a lot of folks around here.
-Oh, of course.

93
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,196
Do you have press credentials?

94
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,698
-What's a New Yorker?
-Magazine.

95
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,865
Magazines don't give out...

96
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,868
You can come to the news conference
with the rest of them.

97
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,495
Sears, Roebuck.

98
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,665
The boy was 1 6?

99
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,833
He was 15.

100
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,501
Nancy was 16.

101
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,753
And it's her friend that found them?

102
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,214
-Laura Kinney.
-Can you spell that?

103
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,802
I assume you're okay with the Laura part.

104
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,179
K-l-N-N-E-Y.

105
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,266
But, pIease, Ieave her be.

106
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:05,520
There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans.
A whole bunch of Mexicans.

107
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,190
Hello, George.

108
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,901
It's good to see you again.

109
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:16,323
I do have an opinion
whether this was the work of one man

110
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,034
or "a whoIe bunch," as you said,

111
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,703
but it doesn't matter a whole lot

112
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:26,374
whether it was Mexicans
or Methodists or Eskimos.

113
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,753
We're gonna find whoever did this.

114
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,756
Now, four good peopIe
from our community are dead.

115
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,633
So let's remember that.

116
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,927
The West Kansas Farm Committee

117
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,597
is offering a $1,000 reward

118
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,516
for information Ieading to an arrest.

119
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,268
PIease print that.

120
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,648
And thank you aII for coming.

121
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,119
He was foxy with that old man.

122
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,298
This make you miss Alabama?

123
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,842
Not even a little bit.

124
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,346
-You lie.
-l don't lie.

125
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,462
-Good morning.
-Hi.

126
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,842
Can any of you tell me
where l'd find Laura Kinney?

127
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,434
ls that her? With the boy?

128
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,602
Yeah, with Danny Burke.

129
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,812
Danny Burke?

130
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,063
Laura?

131
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,738
Thank you.

132
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,783
Truman.

133
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,913
l'm gonna find out where that girl lives.

134
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,249
Can l do that alone?

135
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,961
All right?

136
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,255
Okay.

137
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,019
I think I scared a friend of yours
this morning.

138
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,522
She came looking for you
when I was writing.

139
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,316
-You hate my friends.
-No, I wouIdn't say "hate."

140
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,236
Just as long as they don't
knock on my door.

141
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,241
l saw the bodies today.

142
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,703
-Which?
-The Clutters.

143
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,167
l looked inside the coffins.

144
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,421
That's horrifying.

145
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,424
lt comforts me.

146
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,761
Something so horrifying...

147
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,473
lt's a relief.

148
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,811
NormaI Iife faIIs away.

149
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,065
But then, I was never much for normal life.

150
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,151
No.

151
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,778
Yeah, people here won't talk to me.

152
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,658
They want someone like you, like Nelle.

153
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,327
Me, they hate.

154
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,246
l can't think of a single quality
l share with Nelle.

155
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,290
-Well...
-Maybe manliness.

156
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,922
-Good morning, Henry.
-Good morning, sir.

157
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,592
Let's go.

158
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,385
Bye.

159
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,646
Hi, Danny. l'm Harper Lee.

160
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,324
Nancy was your best friend?

161
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,495
Yeah, she was my best friend.

162
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,498
How has Danny been?

163
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,417
Pretty shattered.

164
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,046
Nothing terrible
has ever happened to him before.

165
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,299
Danny was the last one at the house
that night.

166
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,386
That's why Mr. Dewey
keeps interviewing him.

167
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,972
They don't think
that he had anything to do with it.

168
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,225
lt's just to see
if he remembers anything unusual.

169
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,895
People in town do seem to wonder
if he was involved.

170
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,858
Yeah. That's been really hard for Danny.

171
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,737
Oh, it's the hardest
when someone has a notion about you

172
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,740
and it's impossible
to convince them otherwise.

173
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,036
Ever since l was a child,
folks have thought they had me pegged

174
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,706
because of the way l...

175
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,916
The way l am.

176
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,752
You know, the way l talk.

177
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,213
And they're always wrong.

178
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,925
You know what l mean?

179
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,887
Yeah.

180
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,435
l wanna show you something.

181
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,995
Maybe this will give you a better picture
of what happened.

182
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,789
-What is this?
-lt's your diary.

183
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,126
"Danny here tonight and we watched TV.

184
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,296
"So nice just having him sit with us.

185
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,256
"Left at 1 1 :00.

186
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,969
"P.S. He's the only one l really love."

187
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,432
And that was that.

188
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,526
Did Laura say "shattered"?

189
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:55,323
"Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible
has ever happened to him before."

190
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,995
You know l have 94% recall
of all conversations?

191
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,330
94%?

192
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,165
l've tested myself.

193
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,675
Well...

194
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,553
how did that happen?

195
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,724
Apparently Detective Foxy's wife
has read fiction.

196
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,227
That's great.

197
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,853
We're in.

198
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,397
-We are in.
-ln.

199
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,541
-You came.
-Hi.

200
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,168
-Thank you for having us.
-Thank you.

201
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,380
Get yourselves in here.

202
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,216
Alvin, get your pants on. They're here.

203
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,426
-Hey, little Deweys.
-Hi.

204
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,594
Hi.

205
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,555
Shake it with your wrist.

206
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,226
Use your whole arm.

207
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,686
More.

208
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,064
You think l'm kidding around,
but l'm serious.

209
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,317
Mama would've put in half the bottle.
She had to buy it by the crate.

210
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,111
Alvin's gonna hate this.

211
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,737
l have to stop.

212
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,367
Oh, l cannot believe
you're from New Orleans.

213
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,702
l miss it so much.

214
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:27,415
Well, l only lived there for a short while,
but my mama was born and bred.

215
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,918
You know something?

216
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,922
Alvin pretends he doesn't know who
you are, but the minute you came to town

217
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,674
-he read your books.
-No!

218
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:40,094
He had one of his men pick up
Breakfast at Tiffany's in Kansas City

219
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,722
'cause it's banned in the library here.

220
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,976
And he said, "l feel like you're spiting me."

221
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,565
l said,
"Do you think l took this job to spite you?"

222
00:19:55,777 --> 00:20:00,281
l was writing the script as they were filming,
all that time in ltaly

223
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,783
and l'd work like mad all day long

224
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,745
and then dash down to the bar
around midnight

225
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,788
to hand in the next day's scenes.

226
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,125
And Humphrey had just about
moved into the hotel bar...

227
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,293
Humphrey Bogart.

228
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,086
...where he and John...

229
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,296
John Huston.

230
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,672
...had...

231
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,341
They drank every night.

232
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:22,178
And l mean drank, you know,
like famished water buffaloes.

233
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,971
Well,

234
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,977
l'd only just handed them the final scene
when the bellhop told me l had a phone call.

235
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,648
And it was my stepfather, Joe Capote,

236
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,525
calling to say that my mother had died.

237
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,948
l flew home to New York,
terribly distraught,

238
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,826
but when l got to the apartment

239
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:50,039
l could see that Joe
was in even worse shape than l was.

240
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,709
He grabbed my hand and he said to me

241
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,711
"Talk.

242
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,636
"Talk about anything." You know?

243
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,015
"l mean, any subject in the world.

244
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,851
"Don't worry whether it'll interest me or not.

245
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,520
"Just talk

246
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,565
"so l won't break down."

247
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,487
He couldn't bear to be alone
with his thoughts.

248
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,031
lt was too painful.

249
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,378
lt's been a hard couple of weeks for Alvin.

250
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,548
He and Herb Clutter were good friends
from church.

251
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,841
Oh, Marie.

252
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,719
Oh, come on, Alvin. These are good people.

253
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,626
Why would they put a pillow
under the boy's head just to shoot him?

254
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,639
Why would they tuck Nancy in?

255
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,021
So many of my friends
would love to meet you.

256
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,274
-Oh, that'd be fine.
-You don't have to worry

257
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,235
'cause l'm not going to write about this
till everything's over.

258
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,904
Well, l'm not worried.

259
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:49,283
l know what room you're in at the hotel,
and l know where you live in Brooklyn.

260
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,084
You're celebrating.

261
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,045
WeII, remember NeIIe's manuscript
she sent me in New York?

262
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,964
Yeah. Mockingbird. KiIIing a Mockingbird.

263
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,718
-You said it was good.
-And I was right.

264
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,513
She just heard
Lippincott wants to publish it.

265
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,936
Well, Jesus.

266
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,024
Jesus, well, that's terrific.
Tell her congratulations from me.

267
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,442
Congratulations.

268
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,319
-Thank you.
-Jealous.

269
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,698
-Will you be home by Christmas?
-l wanna come home.

270
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,118
I wanna come home. I do. I just

271
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,787
thought if they catch whoever did this,
who knows what?

272
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:38,207
-l'll probably be here till next Christmas.
-l'm gonna let you go.

273
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,375
l...

274
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,210
No, don't go.

275
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,046
We'll go away next spring to write.

276
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,006
-Maybe Spain.
-Yeah.

277
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,676
-Okay, l'm gonna let you go.
-Jack...

278
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,431
Jack, l promise.
We'll go away this spring to write.

279
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,266
-Maybe Spain.
-Okay.

280
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,269
AII right.

281
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,069
My wife worked there, too.

282
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,197
What did she do in the house?

283
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,909
Cleaning. Cooking a little bit.

284
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,481
Quiet, quiet. Quiet, quiet.

285
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,736
"Girdle up. No extra bulges.

286
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,946
"lf you're dressed right, when he gets home

287
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,949
"the rest of the evening
should be smooth sailing.

288
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,076
"Bon voyage, gals."

289
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,456
l can't believe you got that whole page.
l only read it once.

290
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,625
-l've tested my...
-Tested myself.

291
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,919
-l have 94%...
-Percent recall.

292
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,713
-Cut that out.
-Cut that out.

293
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,131
Cut that...

294
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,929
Cut that out.

295
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,431
lsn't that something, Alvin?

296
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,308
Oh, it's impressive.

297
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,602
Thank you.

298
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,328
-l'm sorry. He's upset.
-What's he upset about?

299
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,288
They know who did it.

300
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,540
Two men.

301
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:46,001
You know, they passed through Kansas City
last week writing bad checks.

302
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:49,213
By the time Alvin's boys got up there,
they were gone.

303
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,714
Skipped out.

304
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,133
Yeah. They don't know where.

305
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,052
No idea.

306
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:59,306
One of them had a cellmate
who gave him up for the $1 ,000 reward.

307
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,393
Do they know the name of the cellmate?

308
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,813
No. No, l don't know. Alvin knows.

309
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,066
l guess this isn't the appropriate time
to go ask him.

310
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,819
He's beside himself.

311
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,327
Hello?

312
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,581
Alvin, get in here.

313
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,253
-Dad, it's the telephone.
-Not now, Alvin.

314
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,172
God damn it.

315
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,342
Get over here.

316
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,179
-Dad!
-Alvin, not now.

317
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,434
Sit.

318
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,196
Dad? Dad?

319
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,034
You need to call the Chief of Police
in Las Vegas.

320
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:07,207
-Alvin, what'd you say?
-He said you need to call them immediately.

321
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,466
-Truman Capote.
-Dorothy Sanderson.

322
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,636
l figured you'd be left alone this morning
by that hardworking husband of yours

323
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,640
so l have breakfast, and l have news,
and l have literature.

324
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,185
My friend, Jack, mailed me
that book you wanted

325
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,687
and l inscribed it myself.

326
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,442
"To the maiden of the Midwest,
the priestess of the plains,

327
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:42,112
"the queen of the kitchen,
my first novel. Truman."

328
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:48,243
-You're too much. Come on in.
-Oh, thank you.

329
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,747
Go into the living room. Have a seat.

330
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,418
Let me get that.
lt's been ringing all morning.

331
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,047
Hello?

332
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,925
Truman, l meant in here.

333
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,678
That's the women's cell.

334
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:51,098
lt's hardly ever used,
but they wanted them separate.

335
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,433
Let's sit in the living room.

336
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,947
They put you in the women's cell.

337
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,126
Do you have any aspirin?

338
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,961
My legs.

339
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,797
Truman?

340
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,300
Please.

341
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,348
l'm sorry.

342
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,944
ln the matter of the State ofKansas
v. Richard Eugene Hickock

343
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,988
and Perry Edward Smith

344
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,575
this court has been informed
by counsel, Mr. Weeks,

345
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:55,871
that the defendants wish to waive their right
to a preliminary hearing.

346
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,708
His mind is somewhere else.

347
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,878
Mr. Hickock, is that your wish?

348
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,507
Yes, sir.

349
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,843
Why are they doing that?

350
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,388
Mr. Smith.

351
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,231
l ask that the waiver be effectuated.

352
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,442
"Effectuated?"

353
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,777
So noted.

354
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,666
Remove the prisoners.

355
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,889
Was it your choice to waive the hearing?

356
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,356
Do you still need some?

357
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,654
Give me your hand.

358
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,088
l could kill you if you got too close.

359
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,187
Now, would you like some water, or...

360
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,158
Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book.

361
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,962
He said we'd curry favor with the judge

362
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,215
if we waived our rights.

363
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,009
Who did?

364
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,303
The lawyer.

365
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,152
Your picture's undignified.

366
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,655
People recall first impressions.

367
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,077
What's been your first impression?

368
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,003
Hello.

369
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,546
-Mr. Shawn.
-Truman.

370
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,090
l'm writing a book.

371
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,425
It's too much for a singIe articIe.

372
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,136
This town, the killers most of all.

373
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,014
You will be stunned by Perry Smith.

374
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,641
Why, what's happening?

375
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:06,394
Well, not much yet, but l know.
l can sense him.

376
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,606
He's desperateIy IoneIy, frightened.

377
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,358
I have a question.

378
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,943
Are you ready?

379
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,903
-Would it matter?
-No.

380
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,282
How much more money can you send me?

381
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:23,203
And how quickly could you get Dick Avedon
out here to take some pictures?

382
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,128
Who are you smiling at right now?

383
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,879
l'm smiling at you.

384
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:36,508
You know, Dick's a very famous
fashion photographer.

385
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,010
World-famous.

386
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,931
Am l gonna be in a fashion magazine?

387
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,060
So there's no worry of having a bad picture.

388
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:54,276
Who were you closer to,
your mom or your dad?

389
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,153
-What's that?
-Who were you closer to,

390
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,280
-your mom or your dad?
-Well, both.

391
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,781
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

392
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,076
-Have you talked to them?
-Yeah.

393
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,162
Who'd you talk to first?

394
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,420
Perry, honey, you look terrific, baby.

395
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,133
That was good.

396
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,595
Can you show us the tattoo
on your chest then?

397
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,804
Yeah.

398
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,979
Where did Perry get the art set?

399
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,069
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

400
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,822
Yes, sir.

401
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,450
Defendants, rise.

402
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,791
Perry Edward Smith
and Richard Eugene Hickock,

403
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:38,004
you stand accused of four counts
of the crime of murder in the first degree.

404
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,091
Have you reached a unanimous verdict?

405
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,759
We have, Your Honor.

406
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,427
What is your verdict?

407
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,763
Guilty on all four counts.

408
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,730
Have you unanimously reached a sentence?

409
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,109
We have, Your Honor.

410
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,902
What is the sentence?

411
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,196
Death.

412
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,216
l need to see him before we go.

413
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,139
Perry.

414
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:33,393
They're going to transfer you
up to Lansing today.

415
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,772
You'll have to make sure
to put me on the visitors list.

416
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,151
Otherwise l can't see you.

417
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,448
l'm going to help find you a proper lawyer.

418
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:54,205
You need a serious lawyer for an appeal.

419
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,919
Now they took Dick Iast night.

420
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,549
And I need you to get him
to do the same thing

421
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,218
and just put me on the visitors Iist.

422
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,833
And l thought, "Where does the family eat?"
You know?

423
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,378
l mean, does he, like,
reach his hand through the bars

424
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,339
and have dinner
with everyone around the table?

425
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:48,426
Nelle, kudos on... KiII the Bird, is it?

426
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,347
-That's close. Thank you.
-That's marvelous. Who's your publisher?

427
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,766
-Lippincott.
-Yes. lt's a children's book, right?

428
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,060
-Yes.
-No, no. lt's about children.

429
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,686
-Yes.
-Yes, l've heard a lot about it.

430
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,896
-Good.
-Congratulations.

431
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,689
-Thank you.
-l didn't even know she wrote.

432
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,691
He's sad and he's shy.

433
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,403
And he's terrified.

434
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,864
They shotgunned the entire family
in the face.

435
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,244
And l thought, at first,
"l'm gonna be scared of these men.

436
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,037
"l'm gonna run, run right home."

437
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,124
Actually, the brother in the family,

438
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,960
Kenyon is his name,

439
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,880
they had placed a pillow under his head

440
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,259
and then shot him point-blank in the face.

441
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,887
Almost as if they were putting him to sleep,

442
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,681
and then shot him.

443
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,853
This is the start of a great love affair.

444
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,064
Yeah. Truman in love with Truman.

445
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:47,152
The book l'm writing will return him
to the realm of humanity.

446
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,864
lt's the book l was always meant to write.

447
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:57,537
Well, he hasn't actually
written a word of it yet,

448
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,999
but he says it's the nonfiction book
of the decade,

449
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,417
so...

450
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,336
So,

451
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,256
what have you been doing?

452
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,179
And l'll tell you,

453
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:18,266
l was in Marilyn's apartment just last week,
talking about movies, art.

454
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:23,480
Finally l had to break it to her that
of the four Matisses hanging on her wall,

455
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,356
two were upside down.

456
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,611
Can l have another, please?

457
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,281
To answer your question,
l'm following Breakfast at Tiffany's

458
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,492
by blazing a different path.

459
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,786
By inventing an entirely new kind of writing.

460
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,955
The nonfiction novel.

461
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,124
-You have a subject?
-Yes.

462
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,126
On the night of November 14,

463
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:49,881
two men broke into a quiet farmhouse
in Kansas and murdered an entire family.

464
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,717
Now, why did they do that?

465
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:55,220
Two worlds exist in this country.

466
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:59,140
The quiet, conservative life,
and the life of those two men.

467
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,352
The underbelly. The criminally violent.

468
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,939
And those worlds converged
that bloody night.

469
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,233
Now, l spent the past three months

470
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,361
interviewing everyone in Kansas
touched by that violence.

471
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,821
Now l spent hours talking to the killers

472
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,615
and l'll spend more.

473
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,576
'Cause researching this work
has changed my life.

474
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,997
You know, it's altered my point of view
about almost everything.

475
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,749
Yeah.

476
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,503
And l think those who read it
will be similarly affected.

477
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,608
So you find them a new lawyer.

478
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,861
Well, they're facing execution in six weeks.

479
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,242
You know, they need someone
to argue whether or not that's right.

480
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:04,956
Okay.

481
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,333
And l'd also like to see them alive.

482
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,460
-Well...
-Yeah.

483
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,338
Yeah, l need to hear their stories.

484
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:17,677
Well, just be careful what you do
to get what you want.

485
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,347
l'm finding them a lawyer.

486
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:26,352
-Truman, you're finding yourself a lawyer.
-No, l'm finding them a lawyer.

487
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,897
There's a difference.

488
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,425
The Warden will see you now.

489
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,264
Well, we do all right by our boys.

490
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,892
Showers once a week. Feed them good.

491
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,979
We'll be feeding Perry Smith
in the infirmary soon if he don't eat.

492
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,773
Try and get the food in through his arm.

493
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,983
l'm sorry, what are you talking about?

494
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,235
Well, he hasn't eaten in a month.

495
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,821
lt ain't his right to kill himself.

496
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,490
lt's the right of the people.

497
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,200
The people of this state.

498
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,661
And that's who l work for, the people.

499
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,789
-No one told me.
-Yeah, he won't eat.

500
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,837
-When can l see him?
-Well, let me see.

501
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,219
How about you coming 3:00,
Thursday afternoon?

502
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,387
No.

503
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,890
That's no good.

504
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,268
l need to see them now.

505
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:52,855
Then whenever l want, for as long as l want.

506
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:57,652
Well, that's just not how we do things
around here, Mr. Capote.

507
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,365
Yeah, l understand what a burden

508
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:06,119
unlimited visitation might be
on this institution

509
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,830
and on the people who pay for it.

510
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,374
And l want to be clear

511
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,585
that l don't expect the citizens
of Leavenworth County

512
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,004
to have to shoulder that burden.

513
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:26,139
This is to be dispensed as you see fit.

514
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,321
You know, l didn't know
where to count your boy at first,

515
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,240
him being half-lndian.

516
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:48,077
But l did him a favor.
l counted him as a white man.

517
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,457
You're a kind and generous man.

518
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,417
Spread your feet.

519
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,302
This way.

520
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,775
-Hey, hey.
-Yeah, hello.

521
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,904
Hey, thanks a lot for your help
with the lawyer.

522
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,322
Oh, that's fine.

523
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:30,995
Wow. You must be really desperate
for a story to come all the way out here.

524
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,834
You want to go see Perry, go ahead.

525
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,586
Thank you.

526
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,838
You want my advice, though, Mr. Capote,

527
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,633
he's just trying to prove
the insanity defense.

528
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:45,403
lt's okay.

529
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,366
lt's Truman. lt's your friend.

530
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:55,913
lt's okay.

531
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,560
This is before she had us.

532
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,063
Before she started drinking.

533
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,067
Who took care of you as a child?

534
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,195
Orphanage.

535
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,781
Me and Linda.

536
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,200
And that's your sister?

537
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:09,672
You know, we're not so different
as you might think.

538
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:14,510
Yeah, l was abandoned repeatedly
as a child.

539
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,769
My mama would drag me along
to some new town

540
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:27,356
so she could take up
with another man she'd met.

541
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:32,778
Night after night,
she'd lock me in the hotel room alone.

542
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:38,451
Mama would turn the latch and tell the staff
not to let me out no matter what.

543
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,081
And l was terrified.

544
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,463
And l'd scream my head off

545
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,135
until finally l'd collapse

546
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:01,682
on the carpet next to the door
and l'd fall asleep.

547
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,771
Then after years of this

548
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,814
she just left me

549
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:12,610
with relatives in Alabama.

550
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,323
Who raised you up?

551
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,076
My aunts.

552
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,581
And that's where l met Nelle.

553
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:28,501
And she lived next door.

554
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,343
Your mother was lndian?

555
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,969
Cherokee.

556
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,848
So drinking was not a good thing for her.

557
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,102
No tolerance for it.

558
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,699
We're on suicide watch.

559
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,787
That's why they leave the lights on at night.

560
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,039
l hope we're past that now.

561
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,374
l do.

562
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,054
Be careful of Ricardo.

563
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,142
l think he wants you all to himself.

564
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:27,977
All right.

565
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,312
But he's naturally mendacious.

566
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,982
Not to be trusted.

567
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,694
lf he had $1 00,
he'd steal a stick of chewing gum.

568
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,748
Perry, l want to take your notebooks
with me.

569
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,086
l want to read them.

570
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,883
lf l leave here without understanding you

571
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:03,053
the world will see you as a monster,

572
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:04,930
always.

573
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,602
l don't want that.

574
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:37,796
'Cause he trusts me.
l mean, that's why he gave it to me.

575
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:41,300
And he's given me absolutely everything.

576
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:45,930
And he wants so badIy
to be taken seriousIy,

577
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,641
to be held in some esteem.

578
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,142
Do you?

579
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,560
Do l what?

580
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,104
Do you hoId him in esteem, Truman?

581
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,733
Well,

582
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,779
he's a gold mine.

583
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,158
And he's told me his entire life.

584
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,495
His dead mother.

585
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,831
He had a brother and a sister
kill themselves.

586
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,083
Awful.

587
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,670
Did you tell him
your mama did the same thing?

588
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,088
See, l can't tell him everything.

589
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,091
We've been taIking our heads off
for the past month.

590
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,009
And sometimes

591
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,015
when l think how good my book can be,
l can hardly breathe.

592
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,857
Anyway, this is what
l wanted to read to you.

593
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,278
"lf called upon to make a speech"...

594
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,363
"lf called upon to make a speech?"

595
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:47,533
l mean, this is exactly
what l'm talking about.

596
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:51,495
A speech, just in case
he's ever recognized for an achievement.

597
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:56,041
"l can't remember what l was going to say
for the life of me.

598
00:54:56,543 --> 00:55:00,546
"l don't think ever before have so many
people been so directly responsible

599
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,840
"for my being so very, very glad.

600
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,884
"lt's a wonderful moment and a rare one.

601
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,720
"Thank you!"

602
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,390
There's an excIamation point
at the end of that "thank you"

603
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,392
in case you didn't catch it.

604
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,397
Where'd you go?

605
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,193
l guess it stopped being funny.

606
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,529
l never said it was.

607
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,741
Wait, listen to this.

608
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:31,744
l was 14.

609
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:35,080
One day l said to her, "Mom's dead."
l could see it.

610
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,417
A week Iater we got the news.
She finally drunk herself...

611
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,835
Found her shivering...

612
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,171
She hit me so many times
with that flashIight,

613
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,339
she broke it.

614
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,424
That night,
I dreamed about that big yeIIow bird.

615
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,259
Clawed that nun's eyes, bright like the sun.

616
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,927
Lifted me to the sky.

617
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:52,431
Sometimes you see a thing how it really is.

618
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,106
Well, you're nothing if not hardworking.

619
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,942
Hey, you look good. Healthy again.

620
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,616
You know,
l've decided on a title for my book.

621
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,619
l think you'll like it.

622
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,621
lt's very masculine.

623
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,040
ln Cold Blood.

624
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,709
lsn't that good?

625
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:27,132
And that refers to the crime or the fact
that you're still talking to the criminals?

626
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,138
The former, among other things.

627
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,724
l see.

628
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,981
l wanted to ask

629
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:46,110
if you'd let me look
at your investigation notes.

630
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:50,155
That lawyer you helped find
for your friends

631
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,991
got them a hearing
at the Kansas Supreme Court...

632
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,410
l heard this morning.

633
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,162
...on the issue of inadequate counsel.

634
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,503
Alvin,

635
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,924
l mean,
do you not want me to look at your notes?

636
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,677
You are permitted to say no.

637
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,186
l'll tell you what.

638
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:24,022
lf those boys get off,

639
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,693
l'm coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down.

640
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,197
l have to be in court at 9:00

641
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,702
but you call Roy Church
and he'll show you what you want to see.

642
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,040
Thank you.

643
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,294
lt's as much for me as for anyone.

644
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:48,881
l couldn't bear the thought
of losing you so soon.

645
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:52,176
We're gonna be able to use your book
for our case.

646
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:56,221
You'll write
we never got to raise an insanity plea.

647
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,392
You wrote how terrible the lawyers was.

648
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,731
l haven't written a word yet.

649
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,159
What have you been doing?

650
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,913
Research. Talking to you.

651
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,919
All right.

652
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:30,422
-l had hoped...
-What are you calling it?

653
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,842
The book?

654
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,263
l have no idea.

655
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,352
Perry,

656
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,605
if l'm going to write about you,

657
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:51,401
if l'm going to determine
how to write about you,

658
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,530
we need to talk about,

659
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,783
you know, why you're here.

660
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,622
You know, the murders,

661
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,374
and that night,

662
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,876
at the Clutter house.

663
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,221
Do you worry what l'll think?

664
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,889
ls that it?

665
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,395
Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor.

666
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,899
l know a lot of people.

667
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:42,160
Perry, l have invitations
to be in Morocco, Greece,

668
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,331
and l prefer to be here,

669
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,000
with you.

670
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,342
Jack, be patient with me.

671
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,846
l'm just missing this one piece.

672
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,099
WeII, how Iong is that gonna take?

673
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,768
Why don't you just try Ieaving him aIone
for a while?

674
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,353
Come to Spain.

675
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:10,522
You can aIways visit him Iater.

676
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,107
l don't know.

677
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,527
WeII, I'm off. I'm just...
I've got my own writing to do.

678
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:18,697
Well, do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.

679
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,283
There's too many peopIe around. I've...

680
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,703
l'll leave the address on the kitchen table.

681
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:29,666
Well, think about what I said,
and join me when you can.

682
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,044
l will.

683
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:33,795
-l will.
-Okay?

684
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,005
Bye.

685
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,405
Hi.

686
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:23,595
Truman.

687
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:27,182
We never intended on killing that family.

688
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,353
Capote, will you get that straight
in your book, please?

689
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,230
No premeditation.

690
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,399
What are you doing?

691
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,526
l have to fly back East.

692
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,028
When?

693
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,532
An hour. l miss you already.

694
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,534
Write me every five minutes.

695
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:49,538
Hey, you know,
we never did intend on killing that family.

696
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:52,958
Capote?

697
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:39,755
What?

698
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,089
Truman,

699
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,468
I've not been abIe to tear myseIf
away from your book.

700
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:46,428
It's that good.

701
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,264
It's not good, it's astonishing.

702
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:52,100
-This first haIf is astonishing.
-Oh, thank you.

703
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,019
When wiII you be done, do you think?

704
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,938
Yes, l'm already well into the third part.

705
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,273
But

706
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:03,528
l can't finish that till l convince Perry
to describe the night of the killings to me.

707
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,324
l was planning to visit this fall, see?

708
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,868
Then I think you need to taIk to him now.

709
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:13,455
And we all need to see how this ends
for the final part.

710
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,459
l can't finish the book
till l know what happens.

711
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,879
lf Perry and Dick are executed,
it's one thing.

712
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,631
And if not, well...

713
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,549
Truman, you got your ending.

714
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,801
l really don't know.

715
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,386
The Kansas Court denied their appeal.

716
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,806
It came over the wire on Friday.

717
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,309
I mean, you need to taIk to Perry now.

718
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:36,520
He'll be dead by September.

719
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,815
I mean, I'm sorry.

720
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:42,901
l know how much
you've come to care about him.

721
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,658
Right. Yes, right.

722
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:53,495
So l want to set up a reading for you
in the fall, in New York,

723
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:57,707
and, well, we'll build some interest,
and we'II pubIish in the faII.

724
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,351
Thank God. There's nothing in the house.

725
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:18,937
Why aren't you working?

726
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:22,566
Well, l knew you couldn't be counted on
to stock the kitchen.

727
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,444
What are we going to feed
our famous guest?

728
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:30,615
Oh, Jesus, l completely forgot.

729
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,202
Plus, l finished my novel yesterday.

730
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:36,454
What?

731
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:54,055
When was the last time you wrote to him?

732
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:56,308
l don't know.

733
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,229
What's this?

734
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:04,399
lt's a letter for Truman
l was asked to deliver.

735
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:06,067
lt's from Perry.

736
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,653
Let's have it.

737
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:20,999
"Dear friend Truman, where are you?

738
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,086
"Read this item in a medical dictionary.

739
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,091
"'Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia,

740
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:33,178
"'by fracture of the cervical vertebrae,

741
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,513
"'by laceration of the trachea.'

742
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,351
"Not too comforting, as we lost our appeal.

743
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,020
"Missing you.

744
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,856
"Alone and desirous of your presence.

745
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,693
"Your amigo, Perry."

746
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,447
Mr. Shawn told me
about the court decision yesterday.

747
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:56,534
l was wondering
why you were in such a good mood.

748
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,621
That's a terrible thing to say.

749
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,875
l write him all the time. l've just...

750
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:07,003
l've been so focused on the book lately.

751
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,564
So Jack thinks l'm using Perry,

752
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:30,485
but he also thinks l fell in love with him
when l was in Kansas.

753
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:34,572
Now, how both of those things can be true
is beyond me.

754
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:36,700
Thank you.

755
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,913
Well, did you?

756
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,833
Did you fall in love with him?

757
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,670
l don't know how to answer that.

758
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:49,921
Truman.

759
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:56,428
lt's as if Perry and l grew up
in the same house,

760
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:02,726
and one day he stood up
and went out the back door

761
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,562
while l went out the front.

762
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,858
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

763
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,448
Listen, you be nice to Jack.

764
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,784
Sometimes l think
he's what l like about you best.

765
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,204
l'll see you at the reading in New York.

766
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:28,460
-1 6th.
-1 6th.

767
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,129
Adiós.

768
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,607
What was he in jail for?

769
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:54,444
Well, they said
it was for not paying his taxes,

770
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:57,739
but really, for being an outsider.

771
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:01,076
Refusing to go along.

772
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,578
Lowell, you're being moved.

773
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:05,538
-Why?
-You're going to final holding.

774
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:06,706
No.

775
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,793
Come on, Lowell. Open the door.

776
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:17,467
Stand up.

777
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,595
-Put your arms behind your back.
-Okay, last chance.

778
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:21,846
Get up.

779
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,724
Turn around.
Put your arms behind your back.

780
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:45,870
Now Dick and me, we're next in line.

781
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:53,128
l'm so sorry l've been away.

782
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,258
lt was a long time.

783
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:01,594
l know.

784
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,600
How's the book coming along?

785
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,146
Very slowly.

786
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:15,567
Will you show it to me?

787
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:18,153
l've hardly written anything.

788
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:46,014
Good evening, New Yorkers,

789
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:51,144
and thank you for coming
to the first pubIic reading,

790
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,938
the first offering of any kind,

791
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:57,233
of Truman Capote's new work,
ln Cold Blood.

792
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,708
Hello. My name is Truman Capote.

793
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:20,381
For this evening's program,
I'm going to read some passages

794
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,301
from the first three parts of my new book.

795
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:34,270
"The viIIage of HoIcomb stands on
the high wheat pIains of western Kansas,

796
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:38,566
"a lonesome area
that other Kansans call 'out there.'

797
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:43,321
"UntiI one morning in mid-November, 1959

798
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:47,367
"few Americans, in fact, few Kansans,
had ever heard of Holcomb.

799
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:51,162
"Like the waters of the Arkansas River,

800
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,623
"Iike the motorists on the highway,

801
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:56,584
"exceptionaI happenings
never stopped there.

802
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,267
"Perry Smith's voice
was both gentIe and prim.

803
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:15,144
"A voice that, though soft,

804
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:17,689
"manufactured each sound exactIy,

805
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:23,403
"ejected it Iike a smoke ring
issuing from a parson's mouth.

806
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:33,621
"The four coffins, which quite fiIIed
the smaII, flower-crowded parlor,

807
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,708
"were to be sealed at the funeral services,

808
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:39,210
"very understandabIy,

809
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:42,755
"for the effect was disquieting.

810
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,343
"Nancy wore her dress of cherry-red veIvet,

811
01:11:47,594 --> 01:11:49,929
"her brother a bright pIaid shirt.

812
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,349
"The parents were more sedateIy attired,

813
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:58,062
"Mr. Clutter in navy-blue flannel,
his wife in navy-bIue crepe.

814
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:02,775
"And it was this especiaIIy
that lent the scene an awful aura,

815
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:06,654
"the head of each
was compIeteIy encased in cotton.

816
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:11,909
"A swollen cocoon twice the size
of an ordinary bIown-up baIIoon.

817
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,245
"And the cotton,

818
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:17,582
"because it had been sprayed
with a gIossy substance,

819
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:20,460
"twinkled like Christmas tree snow.

820
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:26,466
"One Tuesday at dawn,
a carload of strangers,

821
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,177
"ignorant of the IocaI disaster,

822
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:32,597
"were startIed by what they saw
as they crossed the prairies

823
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,557
"and passed through HoIcomb.

824
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:36,267
"Windows ablaze.

"AImost every window

"and in the brightIy-Iit rooms,

827
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:45,318
"even entire families,

"who had sat the whoIe night wide awake,

01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:56,621
"It might happen again."

831
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,500
Thank you.

832
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,984
And l slipped and l ripped a hole,

833
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,362
from the bottom of my scrotum

834
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:33,366
all the way up
to the top of the crack of my ass.

835
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:35,993
And l sat there.

836
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:39,288
And l didn't know it. All l felt was a...

837
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:43,626
l didn't know it. All l felt
was a cool breeze, you know, between my...

838
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,005
Sorry. lf l may...

839
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:50,842
Yes.

840
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:55,555
Your portrait of those men was terrifying.

841
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:57,557
Terrifying.

842
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,185
Thank you.

843
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,858
Stop that man! Come back here!

844
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:08,443
Dad!

845
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:14,365
Have any of you met my father?

846
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:21,414
He hasn't spanked me in years.

847
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,750
George didn't come backstage.

848
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:27,420
He had... He had a...

849
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:30,506
Something that his wife
had to rush him off to.

850
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:34,260
-But he made a point of...
-Well, l'm still waiting for a call.

851
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:37,472
lt was beautiful.
And everybody came. Everybody came.

852
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:40,224
-Tennessee loved it.
-Of course he loved it.

853
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:42,768
Should we do more?

854
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:46,272
No, we just sit and wait
while people talk about it,

855
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:48,483
and we let them do the work.

856
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:52,487
l mean,
this book is going to change everything.

857
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:56,866
lt's gonna change
how people see your writing.

858
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:02,955
l think it's going to change
how people write.

859
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:10,296
-Are you gonna be finished by October?
-l think so.

860
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,385
You know,
they're scheduled for next month.

861
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:17,803
To hang.

862
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:19,514
Yeah.

863
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:25,144
We're gonna commit as many issues
as it takes to publish.

864
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,188
Whatever it takes.

865
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:30,274
Well, l'm going to Kansas tomorrow

866
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,904
-and l'll get Perry to talk.
-What's he got to lose?

867
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:39,492
Sorry, but...

868
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:46,040
Hey, this may sound strange to you

869
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,043
but l'm going to miss him.

870
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,837
You'll be able to finish now.

871
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,696
Need to check your papers, sir.

872
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:22,451
This is what we've been waiting for.

873
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:25,329
A stay of execution
to make a federal appeal.

874
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,039
All thanks to you.

875
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:30,501
Thank you!

876
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:35,131
They're not gonna corner me now.
Not unless the U.S. Government says so.

877
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:40,303
Kansas has had it in for me for 1 0 years.
They can't corner me now.

878
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:43,014
Hey, Perry, sit down

879
01:16:44,224 --> 01:16:45,683
for a minute.

880
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:51,856
l need you to talk to me.

881
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:55,234
We've got all the time in the world to talk.

882
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:57,236
l've been thinking about Ricardo.

883
01:16:57,321 --> 01:17:00,489
You really need to stop sending him
those trashy books.

884
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:03,826
l won't even mention the pornography.

885
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:08,789
Now, l realize that Dick probably can't grasp
the literature that you gave me.

886
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,584
And the books you send him only...

887
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:14,170
They only exacerbate the problem.

888
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:17,506
They only heighten or intensify it.

889
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,217
Maybe we can get him started
on a program.

890
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,887
Perry, l know what "exacerbate" means.

891
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,058
Okay, well, just thinking...

892
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:31,562
There's not a word or a sentence
or a concept that you can illuminate for me.

893
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,774
There is one singular reason
l keep coming here.

894
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:38,069
-Truman.
-November 14, 1 959.

895
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,614
Three years ago. Three years.

896
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:47,536
And that's all l want to hear from you.

897
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:56,921
Now l asked you not to. Ever.

898
01:17:57,756 --> 01:18:02,134
This is absurd.
Do you know what absurd means?

899
01:18:06,598 --> 01:18:09,600
l'm ready. l have a plane to catch.

900
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:12,395
l found your sister in Tacoma.

901
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:15,898
Maybe she'll talk to me
about something useful.

902
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:21,404
Please don't go out there.

903
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:27,243
Hey, this is my work, Perry. l'm working.

904
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:32,039
And when you want to tell me
what l need to hear, you let me know.

905
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:46,053
June's dead. Frank shot himself.

906
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:50,307
Now Perry did what he did.

907
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:55,813
l used to love him. He was my little doll.

908
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,190
He scares me now.

909
01:18:58,942 --> 01:19:02,319
-When was the last time you saw him?
-Ten years ago.

910
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:05,197
Ten years.

911
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:14,498
Could l borrow one of these pictures?

912
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,835
Take the whole thing.
l don't want them anymore.

913
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:24,425
Don't be taken in by my brother.
He's got this sensitive side he'll show.

914
01:19:24,676 --> 01:19:27,678
You believe he's gentle and so easily hurt,

915
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:31,932
but he'd just as soon kill you
as shake your hand. l believe that.

916
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:41,901
Hello, handsome.

917
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:32,243
What's the name of your book?

918
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:35,913
l don't know what you're talking about.

919
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:48,926
"Truman Capote read last night
before a packed audience

920
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:54,473
"from his nonfiction book In CoId BIood. "

921
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:01,605
"The true-crime novel
tells of killers Richard Hickock

922
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,024
"and Perry Smith,

923
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:08,946
"who brutally murdered a Kansas family
three years ago."

924
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:14,785
-Wait, who sent that to you?
-That's not your goddamn business.

925
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,121
lt is my business, because it's not true.

926
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:19,832
The organizers of the reading needed a title.

927
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:24,044
They picked one,
a sensational one, l admit,

928
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,838
to attract a crowd.

929
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:33,721
-They picked it?
-Yes.

930
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:39,310
-lt's not your title.
-Perry, l haven't chosen one yet.

931
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:44,899
How could l choose a title when we still
haven't talked about that night?

932
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:49,570
How could l? l couldn't possibly.

933
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:58,162
You pretended to be my friend.

934
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:00,748
l'm sorry.

935
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:04,501
l should have told you.

936
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:08,672
And l couldn't pretend to be your friend,

937
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:13,052
'cause the truth is,
l can't help wanting to be.

938
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,684
You don't have to tell me anything

939
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:25,522
if you don't want to.

940
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:39,536
l have something

941
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,040
from your sister.

942
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:55,219
She misses you.

943
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,073
Look at my belly.

944
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:38,178
There must be something wrong with us,
to do what we did.

945
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:53,110
We heard there was $1 0,000 in that house.

946
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:57,656
Once we tied up everybody
and searched all over,

947
01:23:58,616 --> 01:24:01,410
l knew the guy that told us about it
was wrong.

948
01:24:01,494 --> 01:24:03,620
There was no money.

949
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,542
Dick wouldn't believe it,

950
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:12,463
so he went tearing through the house,
banging on the walls,

951
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:14,465
looking for a safe.

952
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:20,471
When he was done

953
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:26,185
he said he was gonna go up
to Nancy's room and have his way with her.

954
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:28,979
l wouldn't allow it.

955
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:31,982
And l told him that.

956
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:35,069
So l sat with her.

957
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:38,072
Dick came up and got me.

958
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:41,700
We turned off the lights
and went down to the basement

959
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:45,162
where Mr. Clutter and the boy was.

960
01:24:48,374 --> 01:24:50,834
He kept saying, "No witnesses",

961
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,379
but l figured if l waited him out, he'd...

962
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:57,508
He'd give up
and we'd leave them tied up there.

963
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:01,011
And we'd drive all night.
They'd never find us.

964
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:05,682
We tied Mr. Clutter's wrists
to a pipe over his head.

965
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:09,770
And he looked hurt, so l cut him down.

966
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:14,858
l put a box out there
so he'd be more comfortable.

967
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:21,907
He asked how his wife and daughter was
and l said they were fine,

968
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,869
and they were getting ready for sleep,
and it wouldn't be long

969
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:29,039
till morning when they'd find him.

970
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,550
He was just looking at me.

971
01:25:40,718 --> 01:25:42,553
Looking into my eyes.

972
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:46,473
Like he expected me to kill him.

973
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:51,728
Like he expected me to be
the kind of person who would kill him.

974
01:25:58,903 --> 01:26:02,739
l was thinking,
"This nice man is scared of me."

975
01:26:08,746 --> 01:26:10,330
l was so ashamed.

976
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:19,673
l mean, l thought he was a very nice,

977
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:23,927
gentle man.

978
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:28,765
And l thought so right up till l slit his
throat.

979
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,316
l didn't know what l did
till l heard the sound.

980
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:33,580
Added up,

981
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:39,419
how much money
did you get from the Clutters that night?

982
01:27:43,841 --> 01:27:45,592
Between $40 and $50.

983
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:52,386
I mean, the truth is,
I'm desperate to be done with it.

984
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:58,392
l've spent four years of my life on this book.

985
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:07,067
They got a stay of execution yesterday.

986
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,403
Another, yes.

987
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,410
Supreme Court.

988
01:30:18,996 --> 01:30:20,539
lt's harrowing.

989
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:27,838
Me, all l want to do is to write the ending
and there's no end in sight.

990
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:44,771
No, thank you.

991
01:30:57,910 --> 01:31:01,913
"Dear friend Truman,
haven't heard from you in such a long while.

992
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,791
"Please help find new lawyer.

993
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:09,880
"lf not, Dick will have to write
the Supreme Court brief himself.

994
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:16,136
"Our last appeal.
What a pair of wretched creatures.

995
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:18,722
"Please help. Your amigo?"

996
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:21,975
"Perry."

997
01:31:24,061 --> 01:31:26,146
Just put it with the others.

998
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:57,260
You know, at least for Nelle

999
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:01,139
you should try and pretend
you're having a good time tonight.

1000
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:47,310
l thought l'd find you here.

1001
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:50,021
Oh, Nelle.

1002
01:32:52,358 --> 01:32:53,984
Thank you.

1003
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:56,319
l'll have another, please.

1004
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:01,825
-How are you?
-Terrible.

1005
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:05,370
l'm sorry to hear that.

1006
01:33:05,496 --> 01:33:08,832
l mean, it's torture the way...

1007
01:33:10,209 --> 01:33:12,168
What they're doing to me.

1008
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:19,676
And now it's the Supreme Court.

1009
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:22,596
And can you believe it?

1010
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:26,725
lf they win this appeal,

1011
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:29,436
l will

1012
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:33,189
have a complete nervous breakdown.

1013
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:37,360
l may never recover

1014
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:42,449
and l'll just pray that it turns my way.

1015
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:48,455
-lt must be difficult.
-lt's torture.

1016
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:52,042
They're torturing me.

1017
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:54,461
l see.

1018
01:33:58,924 --> 01:34:01,551
And how'd you like the movie, Truman?

1019
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:28,745
l frankly don't see what all the fuss is about.

1020
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:15,709
Hello.

1021
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:18,044
-Mr. Truman Capote?
-Yeah.

1022
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:22,382
l have a call from Mr. Perry Smith
in the Kansas Correctional System.

1023
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:24,884
WiII you accept charges?

1024
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:26,970
Yes.

1025
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:29,097
Mr. Smith, you're on the line.

1026
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:30,348
Hello.

1027
01:35:32,476 --> 01:35:33,518
Hello?

1028
01:35:33,644 --> 01:35:35,061
Hello, Perry.

1029
01:35:35,187 --> 01:35:38,940
They Iet me make a coupIe of phone caIIs
before I go down to hoIding.

1030
01:35:39,024 --> 01:35:42,360
You heard
the Supreme Court rejected the appeal?

1031
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:48,324
No, l didn't. l hadn't heard that.

1032
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:53,037
Yeah.

1033
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:57,834
l'm sorry.

1034
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:04,048
Yeah. They Iet me make two phone caIIs.

1035
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:10,221
We got a date set for the warehouse,
Dick and me.

1036
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:14,517
Two weeks and finito.

1037
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:16,895
ApriI 14.

1038
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,275
WiII you visit me?

1039
01:36:23,569 --> 01:36:24,736
Truman?

1040
01:36:52,723 --> 01:36:54,265
lt's him again.

1041
01:37:01,398 --> 01:37:04,567
lt is utterly inappropriate for me
to talk to him.

1042
01:37:14,078 --> 01:37:15,161
Yes?

1043
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:22,502
l'm sorry, he won't be able to make it.

1044
01:37:35,432 --> 01:37:37,892
-Hello?
-Mr. Shawn, it's Nelle.

1045
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:40,895
l just got this telegram. Has he seen it?

1046
01:37:41,146 --> 01:37:42,814
He won't read it.

1047
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:46,609
-WouId you put him on, pIease?
-Nelle, he won't talk.

1048
01:37:46,986 --> 01:37:51,239
Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him down
and put the phone on his ear,

1049
01:37:51,323 --> 01:37:53,241
l need to speak to him.

1050
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:56,119
All right.

1051
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:19,684
lt's Nelle.

1052
01:38:26,859 --> 01:38:28,026
Truman.

1053
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:33,364
"Miss Nelle Harper Lee and Truman Capote.

1054
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:39,162
"Sorry that Truman was unable to make it
here to the prison

1055
01:38:39,538 --> 01:38:42,373
"for a brief word prior to necktie party.

1056
01:38:43,125 --> 01:38:45,960
"Whatever his reason for not showing up,

1057
01:38:46,378 --> 01:38:49,881
"l want him to know
that l cannot condemn him for it.

1058
01:38:52,551 --> 01:38:54,469
"Not much time left

1059
01:38:55,512 --> 01:38:58,973
"but want you both to know
that I've been sincereIy gratefuI

1060
01:38:59,058 --> 01:39:03,227
"for your friendship through the years
and everything eIse.

1061
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:07,231
"I'm not very good at these things.

1062
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:11,736
"I have become extremeIy affectionate
toward you both."

1063
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:15,198
"But, harness time."

1064
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:20,411
"Adios, amigos. Your friend, Perry. "

1065
01:39:32,925 --> 01:39:35,551
Well, l didn't expect to see you again.

1066
01:39:36,762 --> 01:39:38,888
You can visit for a few minutes.

1067
01:39:43,352 --> 01:39:44,686
-Yeah.
-No.

1068
01:39:51,068 --> 01:39:52,568
Five minutes.

1069
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:57,365
Well, well.

1070
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:00,785
He returns.

1071
01:40:02,204 --> 01:40:04,914
l don't know what you must think of me.

1072
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:10,128
Well, you haven't been foremost
on my mind lately

1073
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:12,380
as you can probably imagine.

1074
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:17,927
You got the letter?

1075
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:21,472
Yes, l did.

1076
01:40:25,227 --> 01:40:28,980
lt's true.
l understand why you didn't want to come.

1077
01:40:30,941 --> 01:40:33,484
l wouldn't be here either if l didn't have to.

1078
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:35,278
You got that right.

1079
01:40:39,742 --> 01:40:42,618
You know Ricardo donated his eyes
to science?

1080
01:40:44,121 --> 01:40:47,957
Next week, some blind man will be seeing
what Dick used to see.

1081
01:40:48,959 --> 01:40:51,961
Yeah, you could be walking in Denver
or somewhere, Truman,

1082
01:40:52,087 --> 01:40:55,131
and suddenly these eyes
will be staring at you.

1083
01:40:55,799 --> 01:40:58,342
That would be something, wouldn't it?

1084
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:02,472
lt would be. lt would be.

1085
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,987
You'll be watching?

1086
01:41:19,531 --> 01:41:21,491
l don't know, l'll be...

1087
01:41:23,827 --> 01:41:25,328
Do you want me to?

1088
01:41:30,292 --> 01:41:32,335
l'd like to have a friend there.

1089
01:41:33,337 --> 01:41:35,713
Okay. Then l will.

1090
01:41:46,558 --> 01:41:48,059
lt's all right.

1091
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:09,539
l did everything l could.

1092
01:42:10,332 --> 01:42:11,374
lt's okay.

1093
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:23,010
l truly did.

1094
01:42:24,888 --> 01:42:26,055
l know.

1095
01:42:34,898 --> 01:42:36,232
lt's time.

1096
01:42:46,618 --> 01:42:48,035
Mr. Capote.

1097
01:43:04,094 --> 01:43:05,386
Goodbye.

1098
01:43:05,762 --> 01:43:07,763
You're not rid of us yet.

1099
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:10,892
-We'll see you in a few minutes.
-l wish l had...

1100
01:43:10,976 --> 01:43:12,310
Mr. Capote.

1101
01:43:13,228 --> 01:43:14,979
-Mr. Capote.
-Goodbye.

1102
01:44:10,535 --> 01:44:12,161
Nice to see you.

1103
01:44:55,205 --> 01:44:56,998
Perry Edward Smith.

1104
01:44:57,207 --> 01:45:00,918
For the crime of murder in the first degree,
by order of the Court of Finney County,

1105
01:45:01,044 --> 01:45:03,087
and the Supreme Court
of the sovereign state of Kansas,

1106
01:45:03,213 --> 01:45:04,922
you are sentenced to hang until you die.

1107
01:45:05,048 --> 01:45:07,883
"l will fear no evil: for thou art with me.

1108
01:45:08,218 --> 01:45:10,553
"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."

1109
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:13,055
You can say something if you want.

1110
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:20,688
ls there anybody from the family here?

1111
01:45:21,732 --> 01:45:22,857
No, Perry.

1112
01:45:27,738 --> 01:45:29,447
Well, tell them...

1113
01:45:35,454 --> 01:45:39,749
l can't remember what l was gonna say
for the life of me.

1114
01:45:58,101 --> 01:46:01,437
Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.

1115
01:46:01,605 --> 01:46:05,775
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.

1116
01:46:06,443 --> 01:46:08,903
Give us this day our daily bread.

1117
01:46:09,071 --> 01:46:12,073
And forgive those who trespass against us.

1118
01:46:12,783 --> 01:46:16,327
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

1119
01:46:45,982 --> 01:46:48,275
lt was a terrible experience

1120
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:53,697
and l will never get over it.

1121
01:46:55,951 --> 01:46:59,161
They're dead, Truman. You're aIive.

1122
01:47:01,164 --> 01:47:04,834
And there wasn't anything
l could have done to save them.

1123
01:47:07,796 --> 01:47:09,171
Maybe not,
