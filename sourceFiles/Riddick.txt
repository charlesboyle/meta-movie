1
00:01:14,955 --> 00:01:16,183
Don't know how many times

2
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,123
I've been crossed off the list
and left for dead.

3
00:01:20,594 --> 00:01:23,530
Guess when it first happens
the day you were born...

4
00:01:24,332 --> 00:01:25,560
you're gonna lose count.

5
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:32,465
So this...

6
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:35,841
this ain't nothing new.

7
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:57,403
There are bad days...

8
00:10:59,716 --> 00:11:02,184
and then there are legendary bad days.

9
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:06,386
This was shaping up to be one of those.

10
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:11,254
Whole damn planet wanted a piece of me.

11
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:15,325
Can't stay in the open.

12
00:11:17,902 --> 00:11:19,768
Can't risk another attack.

13
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,226
It's always the punch you don't see
coming that puts you down.

14
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,464
But why didn't I see it?

15
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:50,396
Of course they were
gonna try to kill me.

16
00:11:51,238 --> 00:11:53,069
Death is what they do for a living.

17
00:11:58,745 --> 00:12:00,577
So the question ain't
"What happened?"

18
00:12:03,685 --> 00:12:04,845
The question is...

19
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:07,714
"What happened to me?"

20
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,639
You are the Lord Marshal now.

21
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:35,713
How did they get so close?

22
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,885
How did I let them
blindside me like that?

23
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:46,557
Threshold!
Take us to the threshold!

24
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,032
Necromongers.

25
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:52,733
Some wanted to put a crown on my head.

26
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:57,535
Some wanted to put a noose
around my neck.

27
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,039
Please...

28
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,176
come back to bed.

29
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:08,052
Every Lord Marshal was supposed
to take some big oath...

30
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:13,956
one that I never really got around to.

31
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,954
You could say it created
a little friction...

32
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,491
and more than a few assassins.

33
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:26,904
I needed a way out.

34
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,041
Some new place.

35
00:13:37,185 --> 00:13:38,447
Or maybe just...

36
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:40,214
an old one.

37
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:41,578
Furya.

38
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:44,486
I know what it's called.

39
00:13:45,594 --> 00:13:47,391
You just don't know where it is.

40
00:13:48,263 --> 00:13:51,062
- I need charts. I need maps.
- Impossible.

41
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,065
I need a direction.

42
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:54,261
Purged from all records,
as you well know.

43
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,069
But you remember where,
Commander Vaako.

44
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,106
So many worlds...

45
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,776
The only map left in existence...

46
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:08,416
is the one that's in my head...

47
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:10,384
Riddick.

48
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:17,759
So what do you want?

49
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:23,158
The crown?

50
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:30,168
Transcendence.

51
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:35,636
Krone.

52
00:14:36,782 --> 00:14:37,680
Break off a ship.

53
00:14:39,985 --> 00:14:41,213
Riddick's going home.

54
00:14:42,621 --> 00:14:43,611
Vaako.

55
00:14:47,227 --> 00:14:49,695
You can't blame him
for dangling Furya.

56
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:53,160
Home has a certain equity.

57
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,266
But I do blame him for what came next.

58
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,014
It's a long way to come.

59
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,218
For this.

60
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,198
This guy with
the fucked-up face, Krone...

61
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:27,099
he was supposed to be our ride home.

62
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:35,500
But instead of Furya,
we wind up someplace called...

63
00:15:36,112 --> 00:15:37,705
Not Furya.

64
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,016
Yet again,
someone was trying to play me.

65
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:53,996
So yet again...

66
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:58,228
we play for blood.

67
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:32,902
You keep what you kill, Riddick!!

68
00:17:33,972 --> 00:17:35,599
You keep what you kill!

69
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:44,712
Somewhere along the way,
I lost a step.

70
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:47,418
I got sloppy.

71
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,683
Dulled my own edge.

72
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:54,250
Maybe I went and
did the worst crime of all...

73
00:17:56,463 --> 00:17:58,328
I got civilized.

74
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:08,407
So now we zero the clock.

75
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:13,479
Just me and this no-name world.

76
00:18:16,317 --> 00:18:18,808
Gotta find that animal side again.

77
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,850
Before long...

78
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:33,128
I realized there was
a whole other world over there...

79
00:19:34,168 --> 00:19:37,035
of water, grass and life.

80
00:19:39,273 --> 00:19:41,969
Just had one thing in my way.

81
00:23:25,816 --> 00:23:27,647
Come on, show me some teeth.

82
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,156
Escape artist, huh?

83
00:27:26,508 --> 00:27:27,668
What have you got over there?

84
00:27:40,423 --> 00:27:41,890
Thought we shared everything.

85
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:06,715
Drop it.

86
00:29:05,647 --> 00:29:06,705
Stay.

87
00:29:42,654 --> 00:29:44,121
Bounty hunters...

88
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:00,134
Wait.

89
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,903
Wait...

90
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,442
Steady...

91
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:07,776
Okay, now.

92
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,321
Sounds good.

93
00:30:28,136 --> 00:30:29,034
All yours.

94
00:30:35,778 --> 00:30:37,302
It says "dog food" on it.

95
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:40,413
If you could read.

96
00:30:46,255 --> 00:30:47,187
Come on...

97
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,091
Alright. Bring me my reserve.

98
00:31:09,747 --> 00:31:10,736
Where's yours?

99
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,371
Rain.

100
00:31:42,883 --> 00:31:43,872
It's a good thing.

101
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,546
Just because you've never seen it
before doesn't mean it's a bad thing.

102
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:51,857
Hey... easy...

103
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,601
Looks like our time is up here.

104
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:08,362
Nothing.

105
00:34:11,476 --> 00:34:12,465
Look again, Diaz.

106
00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:19,143
Somebody should teach
this Riddick asshole how to count.

107
00:34:20,218 --> 00:34:21,378
"Leave one ship"?

108
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:24,218
Like we've got a fucking spare
laying around.

109
00:34:25,224 --> 00:34:26,555
Let's crank it up.

110
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,468
Morning, Cyclps.

111
00:35:03,664 --> 00:35:04,358
Hey, Luna.

112
00:35:07,636 --> 00:35:08,227
Yeah.

113
00:35:09,404 --> 00:35:10,996
Wake her up, kick her outta bed.

114
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,504
What do you mean?

115
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:14,407
We're running heavy.

116
00:35:15,277 --> 00:35:15,902
She's a prisoner.

117
00:35:16,111 --> 00:35:18,079
- Wasn't she gonna pay our way back?
- We're going big now.

118
00:35:18,947 --> 00:35:22,440
Okay? Cut that 60 kilos loose.

119
00:35:38,702 --> 00:35:42,035
- Get away! Get away from me!
- Stop, just stop!

120
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,298
What do you want now?

121
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,268
I'm gonna take off the restraints.
Okay?

122
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,770
- I don't want them off.
- No, it's not like that.

123
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,214
Nobody's gonna touch you now.

124
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,582
Santana's head is into other stuff now.

125
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,050
Your lucky day.

126
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:06,763
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Alright.

127
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:11,593
What planet is this?
Where are we?

128
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,467
It's got air and water.
That's all you gotta know.

129
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:19,911
- But how am I supposed to survive?
- Just go.

130
00:36:21,381 --> 00:36:23,008
Before he changes his mind.

131
00:36:48,844 --> 00:36:50,641
I was getting attached to her.

132
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:55,750
Now where is my box at?

133
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:19,505
The name...

134
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:21,845
is Santana!

135
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:25,744
Shot-caller for this crew right here!

136
00:37:27,052 --> 00:37:32,752
I am the guy who knows all,
sees all, beats all!

137
00:37:33,925 --> 00:37:35,689
Spitting it kinda strong, ain't he?

138
00:37:37,497 --> 00:37:38,794
Gotta bait the trap.

139
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:43,999
I've come all this way
to collect your head in a box!

140
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,298
Right here!

141
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,204
So have yourself a fine day now...

142
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,569
Mr. Richard B. Riddick!

143
00:37:52,446 --> 00:37:53,936
I suspect...

144
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:58,951
it will be one...
of your very last!

145
00:37:59,786 --> 00:38:03,814
Well, you don't need to agitate Riddick
any more than... you know.

146
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,590
Any more than bringing his head
back in a box would?

147
00:38:33,924 --> 00:38:35,050
Shit.

148
00:38:35,992 --> 00:38:37,653
Here comes the neighborhood.

149
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:43,931
Small world.

150
00:38:52,843 --> 00:38:56,837
Unidentified vessel,
this is Clan Vagos out of Ursa Five.

151
00:38:57,049 --> 00:38:59,040
Be advised that
we are on the ground now

152
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:01,381
and have responded
to emergency signal.

153
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:05,180
No distress found, no need to land.

154
00:39:05,824 --> 00:39:10,319
I repeat, there is no reason for you
to land at this location at this time.

155
00:39:10,897 --> 00:39:12,125
Is that clear?

156
00:39:12,265 --> 00:39:16,292
No reason for you to land
at this location at this time.

157
00:39:18,805 --> 00:39:20,500
What the fuck did I just say?!

158
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,992
It was a long haul.
We could take on some water.

159
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:44,028
Wouldn't mind a little
true-gravity time either.

160
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:48,034
Like I was saying, I've got this.

161
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,970
You know who that was, right?
On the emergency beacon?

162
00:40:00,783 --> 00:40:02,648
Wouldn't be here if I didn't.

163
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,512
The concept of back-up still
has no appeal to you?

164
00:40:07,257 --> 00:40:09,987
My besties here can ball with anyone.

165
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,828
No disrespect for your crew,
of course,

166
00:40:13,397 --> 00:40:17,128
who look strong, too,
in those matchy-matchy outfits.

167
00:40:17,301 --> 00:40:19,827
Shit. Didn't know
there was a dress code.

168
00:40:20,204 --> 00:40:21,228
Yeah, right?

169
00:40:21,606 --> 00:40:23,972
Well, it's not my intention
to jump another man's claim.

170
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,744
If you don't mind, maybe we'll just pull
up a chair and spectate for a while.

171
00:40:30,248 --> 00:40:31,237
What if I do?

172
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:35,014
This is a Co-op station, pal.
It's open to all mercs.

173
00:40:37,022 --> 00:40:39,388
- By the way, my name is...
- "Too late".

174
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:42,852
That's your name.
Too Late.

175
00:40:43,662 --> 00:40:46,393
And I don't need you stepping
all over my dick here, my friend.

176
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,389
Well, I tell you what.

177
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,798
I won't lift a finger to help you until
you come ask me for it. How's that?

178
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:14,591
I was scoping this out earlier.
It's a cave system. Five clicks south.

179
00:41:16,031 --> 00:41:16,998
Might be worth a look.

180
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:19,759
Hey, Too Late.

181
00:41:20,736 --> 00:41:24,103
Need to pull a node from your ship and
store it right here next to mine. Okay?

182
00:41:24,506 --> 00:41:25,404
Oh, really? Why's that?

183
00:41:25,974 --> 00:41:28,500
Riddick triggered the beacon
to get off-world, right?

184
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:33,906
Basically, he was calling a taxi.

185
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:36,475
And...?

186
00:41:37,553 --> 00:41:39,749
And a ship would make
a sweet trap, right?

187
00:41:40,391 --> 00:41:44,418
Confined space, metal walls...
jail cell.

188
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:46,820
Ace cool, huh?

189
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:50,630
Is it true half the people you meet
are below average intelligence?

190
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:53,535
Got to make sure the ship stays grounded
when he comes for them, okay?

191
00:41:54,406 --> 00:41:54,895
Come on.

192
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,473
Dahl... pull a node from the ship.

193
00:42:23,804 --> 00:42:24,236
I'll do it!

194
00:42:45,927 --> 00:42:47,485
Any time now, Riddick.

195
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:15,783
I'm telling you, this is total overkill.
Eleven of us out here now?

196
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,627
Should have been a four-man op, tops.

197
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,727
You are jinxing our janx, man.
And that ain't cool.

198
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:25,095
Hey, I don't give a shit what they say.
He's one guy.

199
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,937
Whatever you say.

200
00:43:30,242 --> 00:43:31,334
He's one guy.

201
00:43:47,093 --> 00:43:50,028
So I guess that's what passes for
a fucking moon on this planet.

202
00:43:51,397 --> 00:43:52,830
It's gonna be a dark night.

203
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,228
Advantage, him.

204
00:43:56,937 --> 00:44:00,532
Maybe he's gonna wear you down first.
Force you to go without sleep.

205
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,635
Can't you see I'm busy?

206
00:44:03,844 --> 00:44:05,505
I'm just sharing my thoughts.

207
00:44:06,046 --> 00:44:08,810
Well, now that you have...

208
00:44:10,518 --> 00:44:15,353
can I politely invite you to
step off my fucking porch?!

209
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:19,153
I'll start rotating down.

210
00:44:19,861 --> 00:44:20,725
You let me know, huh?

211
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:24,060
As soon as I have his head in a box,
I will let you know.

212
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:51,451
Grid 29D.
Stand by, stand by.

213
00:44:56,901 --> 00:44:57,765
What you got, cuz?

214
00:45:01,172 --> 00:45:02,833
Some dingo-dongo thing.

215
00:45:07,512 --> 00:45:09,742
Yeah. I see it now.

216
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:11,382
You want me to pop it?

217
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,845
Knock it down.
One shot suppressed.

218
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,692
Nice work, Diaz.
Encouraging.

219
00:45:22,729 --> 00:45:23,821
Had something in my eye.

220
00:45:24,364 --> 00:45:25,558
It's called a scope.

221
00:45:26,466 --> 00:45:27,524
Try next time.

222
00:45:28,301 --> 00:45:29,290
You got this, right?

223
00:45:31,238 --> 00:45:33,263
Will you get off my freaking frequency!

224
00:45:57,933 --> 00:45:59,059
What the fuck is going on here?

225
00:46:21,425 --> 00:46:22,983
Thank fucking God!

226
00:46:24,027 --> 00:46:25,120
Fuck off!

227
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:32,091
Rubio, coming your way now.
Gotta swap out a bad sensor.

228
00:46:36,107 --> 00:46:37,665
What was here versus what was found.

229
00:46:38,944 --> 00:46:40,036
How does it square?

230
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:44,012
Pretty good. The morphine's gone,
but that's always the first thing to go.

231
00:46:46,018 --> 00:46:47,485
That was a bit weird, though.

232
00:46:48,987 --> 00:46:51,979
"A predator restraint
with 4 2-inch offset jaws."

233
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:54,651
Six listed, zero found.

234
00:46:55,462 --> 00:46:57,555
Well, it is an odd thing
to go for a walk.

235
00:46:58,131 --> 00:47:01,066
Yeah, but Boss, you know how
shit goes missing from these stations.

236
00:47:01,101 --> 00:47:03,467
One bad year and guys
are ripping shit off for salvage.

237
00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:13,602
Hey, Santana?

238
00:47:14,849 --> 00:47:17,215
You did sweep the area
before I got here, right?

239
00:47:17,618 --> 00:47:18,778
Sweep for what?

240
00:47:19,688 --> 00:47:21,883
Well, I just want to make sure
no one has set any traps for us.

241
00:47:22,157 --> 00:47:23,146
5Q.

242
00:47:26,061 --> 00:47:28,757
- Understand what I'm saying?
- Traps?

243
00:47:29,131 --> 00:47:30,189
What kind of traps?

244
00:47:30,632 --> 00:47:32,065
The kind with jaws.

245
00:47:39,342 --> 00:47:40,900
Don't touch that fucking thing!

246
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:48,315
What?

247
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:53,718
Up-armor.

248
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:04,960
Shit!

249
00:48:06,004 --> 00:48:06,732
Ready, ready.

250
00:48:11,075 --> 00:48:13,168
Stay put, stay put!
Stay put, stay put!

251
00:48:23,155 --> 00:48:24,952
Who the hell was
that screaming and why?

252
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,088
Nunez...

253
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:30,694
break out the sweep gear.

254
00:48:31,798 --> 00:48:35,131
And figure out how many
of these big-ass traps...

255
00:48:35,202 --> 00:48:36,829
we got out here, okay?

256
00:48:38,538 --> 00:48:43,033
I'm thinking maybe the whole upper left
quad is some kind of fucking mine field.

257
00:48:43,945 --> 00:48:45,537
You do that now, okay, Nunez?

258
00:48:48,015 --> 00:48:49,448
Copy that, Nunez?

259
00:48:54,288 --> 00:48:55,449
Nunez?

260
00:48:57,993 --> 00:49:00,461
This is bad.
This is very bad.

261
00:49:02,598 --> 00:49:05,294
- Nunez? Nunez?
- Shut the fuck up, puto!

262
00:49:05,601 --> 00:49:08,070
His radio just crapped out.
Someone get eyes on him.

263
00:49:08,705 --> 00:49:11,265
And show him right where
he should be - 13H. Go, go, go!

264
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:19,609
Right here.

265
00:49:20,049 --> 00:49:21,950
13-H. He's supposed to be
right fucking...

266
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:32,228
So this was overkill, huh?
Eleven of us, too many, yeah.

267
00:49:32,296 --> 00:49:33,991
You know all about Riddick, right?

268
00:49:34,465 --> 00:49:36,696
Well, maybe you need
to take that shit back!

269
00:49:37,435 --> 00:49:39,835
Take the jinx off our janx.
You understand me?

270
00:49:41,139 --> 00:49:45,200
That's what you need to do, Falco.
You need to unjinxelate our fucking janx!

271
00:49:52,652 --> 00:49:54,051
Don't mess with me now.

272
00:49:56,989 --> 00:49:58,286
Hey, what is it?

273
00:49:58,424 --> 00:49:59,288
- Get back!
- It's me, it's me.

274
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:00,347
He's got Falco!

275
00:50:09,503 --> 00:50:11,232
Jock up, but you're staying home.

276
00:50:12,673 --> 00:50:14,368
No one's going out there
until I say so.

277
00:50:15,475 --> 00:50:18,274
- Man down, he got Falco.
- Compromise, compromise.

278
00:50:18,346 --> 00:50:21,213
- How the fuck did he do that?
- Never even saw him. He was right here...

279
00:50:21,249 --> 00:50:22,238
What about the ship?
Is he on it?

280
00:50:22,283 --> 00:50:25,946
He's not coming for the ships,
he's coming for us! Just fucking shoot!

281
00:50:34,663 --> 00:50:36,255
One night, three dead.

282
00:50:37,032 --> 00:50:38,522
Not sure I'm loving this trend.

283
00:50:39,368 --> 00:50:40,460
Two dead, one missing.

284
00:50:40,703 --> 00:50:42,170
Exactly. Three dead.

285
00:50:42,371 --> 00:50:44,738
Well, look at it this way, boys.

286
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:48,801
We might all fit on one ship now.

287
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:50,108
Diaz!

288
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,609
Get those other traps back there.

289
00:50:57,488 --> 00:51:01,390
Luna, say something Bible-like
over these bodies.

290
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,565
Okay, maybe...

291
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,671
we zero this out.

292
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:20,438
What is your tag anyway?

293
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,904
So now you wanna know my name.

294
00:51:26,085 --> 00:51:27,450
Well, I'm not sure I'm gonna say.

295
00:51:27,987 --> 00:51:30,547
Because everyone you know by name,
Santana, winds up dead.

296
00:51:34,227 --> 00:51:35,524
You gonna clean this shit up?

297
00:51:37,063 --> 00:51:38,861
Shut up, fucking bitch!

298
00:51:45,205 --> 00:51:45,967
Excuse me.

299
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:48,908
Watch out for surprise attacks.

300
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,243
Maybe...

301
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,977
Maybe it's time to start
merging assets, right?

302
00:51:58,753 --> 00:52:00,345
So this is you asking for my help?

303
00:52:01,022 --> 00:52:04,082
This is me saying that
I may need some of your gear.

304
00:52:06,262 --> 00:52:09,698
If some of your guys happen
to come attached to that gear...

305
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:14,692
I will understand
that's the way it's gotta be.

306
00:52:16,172 --> 00:52:17,764
So you're asking for my gear's help?

307
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:20,069
More like that.

308
00:52:21,344 --> 00:52:22,333
Moss...?

309
00:52:29,753 --> 00:52:32,120
The gear says "nah". Bitch.

310
00:52:33,057 --> 00:52:33,955
There's your answer.

311
00:52:34,592 --> 00:52:36,321
What the fuck do you want, man?

312
00:52:36,794 --> 00:52:40,195
You know what?
I'm gonna fold you in, Santana.

313
00:52:40,565 --> 00:52:44,331
But I give orders to Dahl.
And Dahl's gonna give orders to you.

314
00:52:44,802 --> 00:52:47,169
And that's the chain of command
from this point forward.

315
00:52:48,273 --> 00:52:50,798
Why am I not loving this plan so far?

316
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:54,645
Oh, I know.
You know why?

317
00:52:54,913 --> 00:52:57,746
Because it sucks ass and swallows!

318
00:52:58,016 --> 00:53:01,885
I'm not taking orders from your pet whore
who thinks I won't smack her right back...

319
00:53:04,824 --> 00:53:05,916
I don't fuck guys.

320
00:53:07,427 --> 00:53:09,088
Occasionally I fuck 'em up
if they need it.

321
00:53:12,499 --> 00:53:15,162
Here's what's gonna happen, Santana.
You're gonna take a back seat.

322
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:17,865
We'll track Riddick down, I promise.

323
00:53:18,439 --> 00:53:19,906
But I want him alive.

324
00:53:20,374 --> 00:53:24,071
You give me a day
and after that he's yours to kill.

325
00:53:24,845 --> 00:53:26,336
You're giving me the bounty?

326
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:30,847
You pay my crew, fuel costs,
the rest is yours. That's the deal.

327
00:53:32,387 --> 00:53:36,756
What is Riddick for you?
Not just some convict.

328
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:39,518
What do you want?
Why are you here?

329
00:53:40,029 --> 00:53:41,121
Who are you?

330
00:53:42,498 --> 00:53:43,726
My name is Johns.

331
00:53:44,066 --> 00:53:46,432
Lock down those ships,
get those hogs on deck.

332
00:53:46,469 --> 00:53:48,403
I will ride with Moss and Lockspur.

333
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:52,530
I want a non-lethal load-out.
L.O.D.'s and phosphor frags to start with.

334
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:56,835
This is a man that hunts by night.
We'll take it to him by day.

335
00:53:57,814 --> 00:54:01,045
Diaz! Vargas!
Show me the spot of the last kill.

336
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:06,053
Some kind of canine.

337
00:54:19,404 --> 00:54:21,202
Hey, Diaz, I've got a dog here.

338
00:54:22,241 --> 00:54:24,471
Is it the same dingo-dongo thing
from last night?

339
00:54:25,678 --> 00:54:27,168
Nah, I'm pretty sure we killed that one.

340
00:54:34,821 --> 00:54:35,753
Could be the same one.

341
00:54:37,157 --> 00:54:37,885
The same.

342
00:54:37,924 --> 00:54:40,518
Dahl, get your sniper rifle
and barium rounds now.

343
00:54:52,573 --> 00:54:53,562
1500 meters.

344
00:56:06,819 --> 00:56:08,650
Could be just the first hole it found.

345
00:56:09,389 --> 00:56:12,290
A stressed animal is gonna run
to ground it knows.

346
00:56:14,194 --> 00:56:16,685
Besides...
I'm getting human pheromones.

347
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:40,977
Riddick!

348
00:57:48,929 --> 00:57:50,556
Dial down, dial down, dial down!

349
00:57:58,973 --> 00:58:01,066
- Santana's guy.
- Falco.

350
00:58:01,342 --> 00:58:03,503
Shit. Did we just kill a hostage?

351
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:05,238
I've been hunting Riddick for ten years.

352
00:58:05,647 --> 00:58:07,808
The concept of a hostage
has no appeal to him.

353
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:10,210
Falco was already dead.

354
00:58:10,852 --> 00:58:13,822
This is just some fucking side-show
to buy more time.

355
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:18,191
Fuck!

356
00:58:19,428 --> 00:58:20,190
Shit...

357
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,096
Just dropped some mud right there.

358
00:58:27,404 --> 00:58:28,803
So if Riddick isn't here...

359
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:13,614
Dahl, do you copy?
Does anyone copy?

360
00:59:14,587 --> 00:59:15,645
Dahl, you there?

361
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:13,007
Boom.

362
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,615
Were you just perving out
on me somehow?

363
01:00:20,224 --> 01:00:23,022
May all your dreams come true, baby.

364
01:00:24,696 --> 01:00:27,723
You've got two minutes.
I want you out on fucking watch.

365
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:34,971
Luna!

366
01:00:40,212 --> 01:00:44,047
Don't watch me. Watch my back.
That's what you're here for.

367
01:00:44,918 --> 01:00:47,250
Take two steps forward. Two.

368
01:00:57,898 --> 01:00:59,490
Remember, he could be anywhere.

369
01:01:50,622 --> 01:01:53,216
This is Johns to any-goddamn-body
at the station.

370
01:01:53,892 --> 01:01:58,022
I want you to keep an ey e on that locker.
Keep an eye on the node.

371
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:00,625
Riddick may have made an end run.

372
01:02:01,266 --> 01:02:05,260
My ETA is seven minutes.
But watch your back.

373
01:02:14,747 --> 01:02:15,771
Where did you go, bitch?

374
01:02:18,952 --> 01:02:21,614
Your two minutes are up.
You gonna do what I tell you to do?

375
01:02:22,756 --> 01:02:25,350
Rumor is Riddick might be
in the vicinity.

376
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,923
Thought I should just
check on the locker.

377
01:02:29,897 --> 01:02:34,391
Get outside, get on your optics,
and get after this fucker!

378
01:02:34,936 --> 01:02:36,801
You're not gonna find him here.

379
01:02:49,852 --> 01:02:54,186
Actually, Dahl, I think
we have something in common.

380
01:02:55,157 --> 01:02:58,321
I don't fuck guys either.

381
01:03:43,176 --> 01:03:44,200
You need to see this.

382
01:03:53,854 --> 01:03:54,980
He wrote that?

383
01:03:56,156 --> 01:03:59,216
He took out our deep
space communications. All of it.

384
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:03,855
And whose blood is that?
There...? Here...?

385
01:04:04,331 --> 01:04:05,356
Over there...?

386
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:13,867
I had to kick his ass again.
Sorry.

387
01:04:15,276 --> 01:04:16,265
Not really.

388
01:04:24,253 --> 01:04:24,912
Fuck it.

389
01:04:27,056 --> 01:04:28,387
Let's take a look at this.

390
01:04:40,537 --> 01:04:41,231
Stop.

391
01:04:44,574 --> 01:04:45,803
That key leave your neck?

392
01:04:48,045 --> 01:04:48,807
Never.

393
01:04:49,513 --> 01:04:51,777
Well, the only reason to write
"fair trade"...

394
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:54,483
is if he got into that locker
and he took something out.

395
01:04:55,253 --> 01:04:58,518
Something that we need,
like a power node...

396
01:04:58,756 --> 01:05:01,726
which he could then
swap for something he needs.

397
01:05:02,895 --> 01:05:05,022
All that? Wow.

398
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:07,688
Highly unlikely.

399
01:05:09,735 --> 01:05:11,362
Let me connect
the fucking dots, Santana.

400
01:05:11,436 --> 01:05:13,428
Here's what I'm saying.
If he did get in there somehow,

401
01:05:13,506 --> 01:05:17,465
he was in a position to relock it
and change the code.

402
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:20,670
Could be entering
the wrong shit, Santana.

403
01:05:22,982 --> 01:05:24,006
So...

404
01:05:25,818 --> 01:05:30,153
do you think sometime
during the last few hours...

405
01:05:30,925 --> 01:05:34,292
he got this off my neck
without me noticing...

406
01:05:34,461 --> 01:05:37,157
did whatever he did,
put the fucking key back

407
01:05:37,431 --> 01:05:40,162
on my fucking neck
without me fucking noticing?

408
01:05:41,002 --> 01:05:42,230
Is that what you're saying?

409
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:46,335
Where did you get that theory from?
A unicorn's ass?

410
01:05:46,608 --> 01:05:48,599
There's a reason he is who he is.

411
01:05:48,677 --> 01:05:52,511
He's a convict.
Not some Zulu warlock.

412
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:54,709
You know what you know.

413
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:11,498
This is crazy.

414
01:06:12,703 --> 01:06:15,604
This is fucking crazy.
The first three clicks were good.

415
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:17,837
It did not go off.

416
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:19,804
You can get three clicks
in Russian Roulette.

417
01:06:20,578 --> 01:06:22,307
Don't mean you get four, motherfucker.

418
01:06:22,714 --> 01:06:26,741
You know what, Santana?
For once I actually agree with you.

419
01:06:27,085 --> 01:06:28,074
Shut up.

420
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:33,350
You... Do you think we're good?

421
01:06:34,493 --> 01:06:35,289
Yeah.

422
01:06:36,128 --> 01:06:37,493
I think you're good, cuz.

423
01:06:37,997 --> 01:06:40,056
You're fucking good.
Just butch up.

424
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:44,496
Sounds like your department, lesbo.

425
01:06:44,937 --> 01:06:46,063
I'm not opening that thing.

426
01:06:46,171 --> 01:06:48,766
- Oh yes, you fucking are!
- I'm so fucking not!

427
01:06:50,076 --> 01:06:53,239
Hey, hey!
Use your fucking brains!

428
01:06:53,646 --> 01:06:56,012
We are not gonna do
Riddick's work for him!

429
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:58,381
Put your weapons down.

430
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:00,645
And have a look at that.

431
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:02,719
He was here.

432
01:07:03,824 --> 01:07:04,791
Right fucking there.

433
01:07:05,893 --> 01:07:07,690
Santana, put your fucking sword away.

434
01:07:11,732 --> 01:07:13,359
Don't fucking open it, then.

435
01:07:14,101 --> 01:07:16,832
Well, the problem with that, Santana,
we never open that locker...

436
01:07:17,172 --> 01:07:18,537
and we never leave.

437
01:07:36,092 --> 01:07:39,653
...of my life and my salvation
Whom shall I fear.

438
01:07:40,229 --> 01:07:42,255
The strength of my life
of Whom shall I be afraid.

439
01:07:47,237 --> 01:07:48,033
Four.

440
01:07:49,206 --> 01:07:49,968
Try five.

441
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:57,376
Five.

442
01:08:04,189 --> 01:08:04,883
And...

443
01:08:11,764 --> 01:08:12,458
Oops.

444
01:08:14,233 --> 01:08:15,461
Wish I'd have thought of that.

445
01:08:26,113 --> 01:08:26,807
Six!

446
01:08:30,817 --> 01:08:31,681
Six.

447
01:08:36,591 --> 01:08:37,353
Six.

448
01:08:40,094 --> 01:08:43,120
You are a shit storm trooper, Santana.
I'll give you that.

449
01:08:43,764 --> 01:08:45,026
You beat the devil this time.

450
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,265
Didn't actually think
he was gonna do it.

451
01:08:49,036 --> 01:08:50,004
This is a sign.

452
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:54,137
Sweet.

453
01:08:55,944 --> 01:08:57,309
I believe this is a sign.

454
01:09:00,582 --> 01:09:03,278
It may be the good Lord
wants us to take these nodes...

455
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:05,747
and flee this planet
just as soon as we can.

456
01:09:11,161 --> 01:09:13,129
That's my good luck charm.

457
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:18,134
Wrong business, kid.

458
01:09:19,503 --> 01:09:21,471
You know, I was kind of hoping
the bomb would go off.

459
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:36,183
So we sealed up his cave with some
phosphor frags here, so he can't go back.

460
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:39,223
And just like an animal,
he's gonna head to known ground.

461
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:42,226
But we're gonna find he's got
three or four layers out there.

462
01:09:42,827 --> 01:09:45,262
So we'll radius out
from this point... here.

463
01:09:46,165 --> 01:09:49,657
That radio counts. I saw three
repeaters listed in inventory.

464
01:09:50,069 --> 01:09:52,560
Find them.
Set them up at regular intervals.

465
01:09:53,539 --> 01:09:55,404
I never want to be out of
communication like that again.

466
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:32,204
Are you scared of me?

467
01:10:34,883 --> 01:10:35,611
Yeah.

468
01:10:40,323 --> 01:10:41,517
Are they scared of me?

469
01:10:43,927 --> 01:10:45,451
Yes, they're scared of you.

470
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:54,301
Maybe you're all scared
of the wrong thing.

471
01:10:55,206 --> 01:10:57,606
Lockspur, I want you to lock
down those hogs, alright?

472
01:10:57,708 --> 01:11:00,142
I don't want this guy any
more mobile than he already is.

473
01:11:00,845 --> 01:11:03,609
Dahl, I spotted a nice
little nest for you.

474
01:11:03,714 --> 01:11:05,477
Right here and in these low hills.

475
01:11:12,357 --> 01:11:13,153
Moss?

476
01:11:16,795 --> 01:11:17,819
I just saw him.

477
01:11:19,999 --> 01:11:20,693
Say it again?

478
01:11:22,402 --> 01:11:23,630
I just saw him.

479
01:11:34,782 --> 01:11:36,374
Dahl, I want you to sit on this ship!

480
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,783
Diaz, make sure your ship
is locked down!

481
01:11:38,819 --> 01:11:42,880
The rest of you get on the fucking perimeter
and keep your eyes on each other!

482
01:11:43,123 --> 01:11:46,286
Santana!
He got the fucking nodes!

483
01:12:34,278 --> 01:12:36,906
I know.
It's coming.

484
01:12:40,151 --> 01:12:41,854
So then we just combine nodes.

485
01:12:41,854 --> 01:12:43,719
Pull one from that ship,
put it in this ship, you know?

486
01:12:43,889 --> 01:12:44,685
Amps is amps, right?

487
01:12:45,157 --> 01:12:47,921
It's not about amps. It's about
what each ship is rated to handle.

488
01:12:48,026 --> 01:12:50,392
You miss by even a few milli-joules,
you fry every chip you've got.

489
01:12:50,596 --> 01:12:52,894
Okay, so figure out the difference,
and just do it.

490
01:12:53,232 --> 01:12:54,791
Jailbreak the fucking thing.

491
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:56,629
I could give you a crash course

492
01:12:56,669 --> 01:12:59,763
on thermodynamic equilibrium
and energy exchange right now...

493
01:13:00,006 --> 01:13:02,600
or maybe you just want to take
my goddamn word for it.

494
01:13:02,709 --> 01:13:03,403
I get it, I get it.

495
01:13:03,443 --> 01:13:06,469
The ships are incompatible. We're not
gonna fly without the nodes back.

496
01:13:06,546 --> 01:13:08,640
Why do I feel like we just
cut off our own nuts here?

497
01:13:08,749 --> 01:13:10,080
Probably because we did.

498
01:13:10,484 --> 01:13:13,078
How about I take one of those jet hogs,
two days worth of food...

499
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,678
and go out and hunt
this fucker down myself.

500
01:13:14,789 --> 01:13:17,087
Bad idea, Diaz.
One-on-one with Riddick?

501
01:13:17,391 --> 01:13:19,552
I might be able to get
the emergency beacon working again.

502
01:13:20,094 --> 01:13:22,529
That's like an ambulance
calling for an ambulance, isn't it?

503
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:24,928
It's back-up for the fucking back-up.
We can't.

504
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,625
I thought he was the one stranded here.

505
01:13:26,768 --> 01:13:28,292
Yeah, well, looks like
you thought wrong.

506
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:30,628
Long wait for back-up.

507
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:36,703
In case you were thinking about fixing
the beacon and calling for help.

508
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,374
Falco's radio.

509
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:41,850
Riddick, I don't give a fuck
about the back-up.

510
01:13:42,952 --> 01:13:46,217
Because I've still got all kinds of gear
that can ruin your day in a hurry.

511
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:50,587
So you go find another fucking cave.

512
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:53,462
You keep running, you keep hiding.

513
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:55,996
Doesn't matter to me.

514
01:13:57,468 --> 01:13:59,629
Because in the end, I will find you!!

515
01:14:02,774 --> 01:14:03,638
Look south.

516
01:14:25,831 --> 01:14:26,991
I don't believe it.

517
01:14:28,133 --> 01:14:30,102
The balls on this fucking guy.

518
01:14:32,706 --> 01:14:34,264
Dahl, keep an eye on things here.

519
01:14:37,511 --> 01:14:39,274
- What should I do?
- Stay low.

520
01:14:42,349 --> 01:14:43,612
Come on. Come on.

521
01:15:05,874 --> 01:15:06,670
Both of you drop.

522
01:15:30,467 --> 01:15:31,866
So what's the bounty at?

523
01:15:32,803 --> 01:15:35,101
I don't know. I don't care.
It's not why I'm here.

524
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:37,608
I bet the big jamoke knows.

525
01:15:38,109 --> 01:15:40,703
Yeah. I know exactly what it is.

526
01:15:41,346 --> 01:15:44,611
What I do know is that it's double
if you're brought back dead.

527
01:15:45,684 --> 01:15:46,844
That's new.

528
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,813
Will it be enough to pay
for your funerals?

529
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:54,353
What I'm interested in...

530
01:15:55,394 --> 01:15:59,694
is a little backwater place
with a system code M-344-G.

531
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,932
I want to know what happened
there ten years ago.

532
01:16:06,607 --> 01:16:07,574
The father.

533
01:16:12,012 --> 01:16:14,207
- Big Daddy Johns.
- Yeah, that's right.

534
01:16:15,115 --> 01:16:18,847
And you traveled all this way
just to see me.

535
01:16:21,122 --> 01:16:22,089
I'm flattered.

536
01:16:22,957 --> 01:16:25,687
Well, it's kind of strange not knowing
what to put down in the family Bible.

537
01:16:26,361 --> 01:16:29,194
It's kinda strange three guys
have to die just to you can hear...

538
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:31,562
No, no, no.
You don't get to put that shit on me.

539
01:16:32,768 --> 01:16:34,235
Those kills are on you.

540
01:16:34,903 --> 01:16:37,770
I have a feeling that's not
the only thing on me right now.

541
01:16:38,641 --> 01:16:41,610
Okay, got barium shells,
stab-shock, explosive tip...

542
01:16:41,677 --> 01:16:43,474
What do you want, barium or stab-shock?

543
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,277
Horse tranq.

544
01:16:52,989 --> 01:16:56,015
I hate to interrupt this discussion
about ancient history,

545
01:16:56,092 --> 01:16:59,392
but maybe I should step in right here
and introduce myself.

546
01:16:59,897 --> 01:17:01,797
- My name is...
- Box Boy.

547
01:17:03,768 --> 01:17:04,427
Say what?

548
01:17:05,403 --> 01:17:09,863
You are the guy who said that he was
gonna put my head in a box. Right?

549
01:17:10,975 --> 01:17:14,639
Well, that was me...
spitting noise.

550
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:18,015
But you do have a box.

551
01:17:18,517 --> 01:17:20,451
Do I have a box?

552
01:17:20,519 --> 01:17:21,952
Thought I saw one.

553
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:26,590
I mean, of course I've got a box.
Everyone's got a box, man.

554
01:17:27,326 --> 01:17:29,794
Even Diaz has a fucking huge box.

555
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:31,829
Good.

556
01:17:33,266 --> 01:17:34,665
We're gonna use it.

557
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:41,037
Three down, eight left.

558
01:17:41,809 --> 01:17:43,606
Now, normally I'd just keep going.

559
01:17:44,244 --> 01:17:47,771
Six down... nine down...

560
01:17:48,816 --> 01:17:50,784
You get where I'm going with this.

561
01:17:52,219 --> 01:17:53,585
But things are changing here...

562
01:17:53,922 --> 01:17:57,517
and nobody wants to be
on this planet 24 hours from now.

563
01:17:58,626 --> 01:18:00,491
So I suggest we make it work.

564
01:18:01,229 --> 01:18:02,719
What do you want,
a "gentleman’s agreement"?

565
01:18:03,331 --> 01:18:06,824
I'll leave one node out in the open.
You take it.

566
01:18:07,203 --> 01:18:10,434
The other node
and the other ship are mine.

567
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:11,764
Hey, wait, wait.

568
01:18:11,841 --> 01:18:15,902
What are we playing here,
Retard Bingo? What?

569
01:18:16,712 --> 01:18:19,647
- That was on the table from the start...
- Forget the start.

570
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:24,678
It's the end you want
to think about now.

571
01:18:27,991 --> 01:18:28,980
See that?

572
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:36,457
I'll give you till that rain
hits that station.

573
01:18:38,736 --> 01:18:39,964
That's your clock.

574
01:18:48,113 --> 01:18:49,045
"Box Boy".

575
01:19:04,397 --> 01:19:06,490
Dahl! Do it now! Now!

576
01:19:23,551 --> 01:19:24,210
Again!

577
01:19:30,292 --> 01:19:31,384
He's not going down.

578
01:19:35,697 --> 01:19:36,664
Do it again, Dahl!

579
01:19:42,405 --> 01:19:43,804
Just go down.

580
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:37,988
I got this, Dahl.

581
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:13,295
Riddick.

582
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:14,863
Riddick?

583
01:21:24,881 --> 01:21:25,745
Johns?

584
01:21:29,252 --> 01:21:31,016
You beating men in chains now?

585
01:21:38,228 --> 01:21:41,994
Okay, from the beginning.
For the historical record...

586
01:21:42,766 --> 01:21:43,494
The Hunter Gratzner.

587
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,593
That's the commercial vessel my son uses
to transport you back to the slammer.

588
01:21:46,838 --> 01:21:51,332
But that ship sends a distress call
somewhere near M-344/G.

589
01:21:51,876 --> 01:21:55,312
It's a backwater system, two suns,
one habitable planet.

590
01:21:57,449 --> 01:21:59,077
Does he survive the crash?

591
01:22:00,686 --> 01:22:02,483
Big drama the next few hours.

592
01:22:03,756 --> 01:22:08,591
But whatever happens,
no matter what they tell you...

593
01:22:09,929 --> 01:22:11,989
don't let 'em take these chains off me.

594
01:22:13,734 --> 01:22:17,101
"Them?" Who's "them?" Who're you talking...
Do you know who you're talking to here?

595
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:22,766
That was for me?

596
01:22:25,313 --> 01:22:26,678
When the chains come off...

597
01:22:26,781 --> 01:22:29,079
- Jesus Christ!
- Box Boy...

598
01:22:30,018 --> 01:22:33,078
you go in the first five seconds.

599
01:22:34,455 --> 01:22:35,353
Really?

600
01:22:36,758 --> 01:22:38,750
And you plan on killing me with what,
your mouth?

601
01:22:40,396 --> 01:22:41,727
That shiny blade.

602
01:22:42,998 --> 01:22:44,431
I'd love to see you try.

603
01:22:48,103 --> 01:22:50,037
For the historical record...

604
01:22:51,974 --> 01:22:53,033
he made it.

605
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:00,676
So it's just you and him?

606
01:23:02,252 --> 01:23:03,412
Was, uh...

607
01:23:04,754 --> 01:23:07,383
about the same number
you see here in this room.

608
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:10,717
So now many made it off?

609
01:23:11,829 --> 01:23:12,989
Three.

610
01:23:14,732 --> 01:23:15,892
But not him?

611
01:23:17,935 --> 01:23:18,993
No.

612
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:23,034
So between the time of the crash
and the time you leave that planet...

613
01:23:24,209 --> 01:23:25,471
my son dies.

614
01:23:26,111 --> 01:23:30,571
And I can safely assume
it's at your hands. Is that right?

615
01:23:33,786 --> 01:23:35,515
I'm wasting my fucking time here!

616
01:23:38,691 --> 01:23:40,522
You grant any last wishes?

617
01:23:46,467 --> 01:23:48,059
I was referring to you.

618
01:23:49,336 --> 01:23:53,670
Not that the chains aren't
a hot look, but no.

619
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:57,537
I'm not gonna straddle you
in front of all these guys.

620
01:23:57,744 --> 01:23:59,678
What if I killed all of 'em first?

621
01:24:02,283 --> 01:24:03,113
Easy, boy.

622
01:24:03,952 --> 01:24:06,216
There's a lot more tranq
where that came from.

623
01:24:08,723 --> 01:24:11,351
Tell me what you see outside
that window, Dahl.

624
01:24:22,671 --> 01:24:25,139
Cyclps unit, two ships...

625
01:24:25,407 --> 01:24:27,467
couple dead guys in plastic.

626
01:24:28,311 --> 01:24:29,903
And you don't see anything else?

627
01:24:30,213 --> 01:24:31,180
Nothing else.

628
01:24:32,249 --> 01:24:34,114
Let me know when you do.

629
01:24:36,019 --> 01:24:38,419
Love those toenails, by the way.

630
01:24:40,657 --> 01:24:41,488
Yeah?

631
01:24:42,493 --> 01:24:43,721
Predator Pink.

632
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:46,596
Matches your nipples.

633
01:24:47,798 --> 01:24:50,961
Why are we even listening
to this big fuckstick?

634
01:24:51,402 --> 01:24:54,804
Can we just detach his head, please?

635
01:24:55,407 --> 01:24:56,840
Here's what's gonna happen.

636
01:24:57,142 --> 01:25:00,475
The next 60 seconds, you're gonna watch
your own head drop into that box.

637
01:25:02,147 --> 01:25:03,114
Nothing...

638
01:25:04,183 --> 01:25:07,016
nothing is gonna keep you
from that special place in Hell.

639
01:25:09,956 --> 01:25:12,823
Maybe in the last minute of your life,
you want to be something more...

640
01:25:12,926 --> 01:25:14,985
than a goddamn savage!!

641
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:18,722
Gimme some fucking answers!

642
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,098
Please!

643
01:25:30,811 --> 01:25:33,974
Well, is there anything you'd like
to add on the subject I just raised?

644
01:25:54,203 --> 01:25:54,999
Time's up.

645
01:26:01,777 --> 01:26:02,540
Time's up.

646
01:26:04,881 --> 01:26:05,677
He's all yours.

647
01:26:13,624 --> 01:26:14,488
Hold him down.

648
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:40,643
End of game, dude.

649
01:26:49,929 --> 01:26:51,328
More dingo-dongos maybe.

650
01:26:56,102 --> 01:26:56,762
Fuck it.

651
01:27:00,808 --> 01:27:02,139
I know what's coming.

652
01:27:04,045 --> 01:27:07,378
Called to find you.
The serpents...

653
01:27:28,438 --> 01:27:29,462
Spotlight!

654
01:27:56,868 --> 01:27:58,062
Like I said...

655
01:27:59,838 --> 01:28:02,204
it ain't me you gotta worry about.

656
01:28:06,812 --> 01:28:08,473
What is it?
What's out there?

657
01:28:09,548 --> 01:28:10,412
I don't know.

658
01:28:11,784 --> 01:28:13,115
Fucked up or something out there.

659
01:28:14,019 --> 01:28:17,045
It ain't right.
It's coming our way.

660
01:28:26,366 --> 01:28:29,096
Whatever they are,
they ain't so hard to kill.

661
01:29:10,447 --> 01:29:11,311
What the fuck?!

662
01:29:32,971 --> 01:29:33,699
Fuck!

663
01:29:48,654 --> 01:29:50,281
No more holes, please.

664
01:30:24,693 --> 01:30:26,524
Now here's what's gonna happen.

665
01:30:28,497 --> 01:30:31,125
In 60 seconds you're gonna
take these chains off me.

666
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,531
We're gonna make a play for
those nodes and get off this rock.

667
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:37,197
But somewhere along the line...

668
01:30:38,842 --> 01:30:40,707
when it gets really bad...

669
01:30:43,246 --> 01:30:44,270
Johns...

670
01:30:46,249 --> 01:30:49,344
is gonna fold
just like Little Johns did.

671
01:30:51,389 --> 01:30:52,947
Then when it's all over...

672
01:30:53,925 --> 01:30:56,587
and the rest of you are ready
for Dead Animal Pickup...

673
01:30:58,229 --> 01:31:00,697
I'm gonna go balls deep into Dahl.

674
01:31:02,467 --> 01:31:04,526
But only because she asked me to.

675
01:31:06,672 --> 01:31:07,900
Sweet-like.

676
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:14,537
What does he mean, "When things go bad"?
This doesn't qualify as bad?!

677
01:31:15,915 --> 01:31:18,611
What the fuck is happening?
How fucked are we?

678
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:21,116
Who knows how long it will rain?

679
01:31:23,389 --> 01:31:27,382
Or just how many of them
are buried out there?

680
01:31:29,530 --> 01:31:33,057
He saw it. He saw it with those eyes
of his and he didn't tell us what.

681
01:31:43,645 --> 01:31:46,546
One ship for you, one for me.

682
01:31:47,649 --> 01:31:50,049
I need to know that
these nodes are retrievable.

683
01:31:52,454 --> 01:31:54,319
And I need to know we have a deal.

684
01:31:59,195 --> 01:32:00,253
We got a deal.

685
01:32:08,204 --> 01:32:10,332
The chains stay on.

686
01:32:23,588 --> 01:32:24,919
Why don't we sit this one out?

687
01:32:28,493 --> 01:32:29,323
Okay, okay.

688
01:32:31,562 --> 01:32:33,462
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up...

689
01:32:36,535 --> 01:32:37,399
Good doggie.

690
01:33:15,810 --> 01:33:18,041
Holy... shit.

691
01:33:21,383 --> 01:33:22,680
Yeah.

692
01:33:23,618 --> 01:33:25,142
Let's cut him loose.

693
01:33:26,822 --> 01:33:28,289
That was five seconds.

694
01:33:29,424 --> 01:33:31,518
I like to be a man of my word.

695
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:36,928
How about you, Johns?

696
01:34:22,581 --> 01:34:25,449
He shall give His angels charge over me,
keep me in all His grace...

697
01:34:25,485 --> 01:34:27,112
- Shut the noise, Luna!
- as long as I live.

698
01:34:27,687 --> 01:34:31,919
You know, I think the angels
are here protecting me.

699
01:34:32,492 --> 01:34:34,426
And if they're here,
watching over me...

700
01:34:34,461 --> 01:34:35,120
Maybe they'll deliver us...

701
01:34:35,228 --> 01:34:36,593
- all from this crazy-shit place.
- That shit is creeping everybody out...

702
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:39,293
- so shut the fuck up!
- You shut the fuck up, Vargas!

703
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:40,459
Leave the kid alone.

704
01:34:48,709 --> 01:34:51,177
Where the hell did that...?
Jesus Christ!

705
01:34:52,648 --> 01:34:53,478
No, no, no, no!

706
01:34:56,718 --> 01:34:59,321
What the fuck is wrong with you,
you crazy bastard!

707
01:34:59,321 --> 01:35:00,219
You could have killed me!

708
01:35:00,622 --> 01:35:01,554
Got it, didn't I?

709
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:11,592
Vargas, get up.

710
01:35:13,136 --> 01:35:14,694
Vargas, get up.
Come on, let's go!

711
01:35:15,438 --> 01:35:18,737
Vargas, come on, man. Walk it off.
Let's go. It's just a little one.

712
01:35:19,276 --> 01:35:20,868
Small ones are the worst.

713
01:35:22,746 --> 01:35:24,407
They save the most venom.

714
01:35:37,796 --> 01:35:38,558
And kid?

715
01:35:40,298 --> 01:35:41,560
Leave God out of this.

716
01:35:42,467 --> 01:35:44,662
He wants no part of what happens next.

717
01:35:56,182 --> 01:35:57,308
I forgot to mention...

718
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:00,347
there's no weapons for you.

719
01:36:08,195 --> 01:36:09,924
You think you can ride
one of these things?

720
01:36:10,764 --> 01:36:12,561
I'll ride it like I stole it.

721
01:36:27,549 --> 01:36:28,379
I'll take flank.

722
01:36:39,895 --> 01:36:41,625
If Riddick comes back here
without us...

723
01:36:42,299 --> 01:36:44,699
you go ahead,
you kill him on general principle.

724
01:36:45,735 --> 01:36:48,101
Is that before or after
I'm supposed to fuck him?

725
01:39:21,035 --> 01:39:23,869
You asshole motherfucker!
Just sitting there watching!

726
01:39:23,972 --> 01:39:27,430
Would have covered you,
but you said "no weapons".

727
01:39:33,949 --> 01:39:36,679
I bet you want those nodes, Johns.

728
01:40:12,657 --> 01:40:15,125
Hey, I don't suppose you took
the time to do this for him, huh?

729
01:40:18,097 --> 01:40:20,292
This may come
as a shock to you, Johns...

730
01:40:22,301 --> 01:40:23,893
but I didn't ghost your son.

731
01:40:26,405 --> 01:40:28,430
He seemed set on killing himself.

732
01:40:32,379 --> 01:40:33,573
What the fuck does that mean?

733
01:40:34,948 --> 01:40:35,937
Morphine.

734
01:40:38,018 --> 01:40:39,576
Your son liked his morphine.

735
01:40:40,921 --> 01:40:42,252
Liked it twice a day.

736
01:40:43,757 --> 01:40:45,453
Didn't know your son was a junkie?

737
01:40:49,697 --> 01:40:51,358
Johns was like most mercs.

738
01:40:52,466 --> 01:40:55,594
They look all stand-up and do-right...

739
01:40:56,370 --> 01:40:58,770
until you cut them open
and you find something missing.

740
01:41:00,175 --> 01:41:02,040
In his case, a spine.

741
01:41:03,979 --> 01:41:06,971
I don't have to listen to this shit!
That's not the man I knew.

742
01:41:07,616 --> 01:41:09,015
Then you didn't know your son.

743
01:41:15,091 --> 01:41:16,388
He wanted to kill a kid.

744
01:41:18,761 --> 01:41:20,251
To save his own skin.

745
01:41:21,297 --> 01:41:22,594
I had a problem with that.

746
01:41:24,601 --> 01:41:26,001
You expect me to believe...

747
01:41:27,137 --> 01:41:29,605
my son was gonna kill
a child to save his own life?

748
01:41:32,610 --> 01:41:35,943
Morphine makes the brain soft.
Heart wrong.

749
01:41:39,918 --> 01:41:41,078
I don't fucking buy it!

750
01:41:42,387 --> 01:41:44,514
I just can't believe
that my son's the bad guy

751
01:41:44,556 --> 01:41:47,753
in this fucking demented
fairy tale of yours.

752
01:41:50,629 --> 01:41:52,221
No reason to lie now...

753
01:41:55,401 --> 01:41:56,333
Johns.

754
01:41:59,805 --> 01:42:01,067
Either one of us.

755
01:42:30,505 --> 01:42:32,735
Thanks for starting
the killing spree for me, Riddick.

756
01:42:32,907 --> 01:42:34,136
But I'll take it from here.

757
01:43:27,666 --> 01:43:28,793
Jamoke.

758
01:43:33,973 --> 01:43:36,100
So that blade you buried
was meant for me?

759
01:43:38,444 --> 01:43:40,503
Anyone who deserved it, really.

760
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:45,613
We've got a problem, Riddick...

761
01:43:47,554 --> 01:43:49,146
because I've got two nodes here.

762
01:43:49,923 --> 01:43:51,049
We've got one hog.

763
01:43:52,259 --> 01:43:56,321
And I sure as shit am not
riding bitch with you again.

764
01:43:58,600 --> 01:43:59,624
One hog?

765
01:44:01,403 --> 01:44:03,166
You sure about that, Johns?

766
01:44:09,145 --> 01:44:11,375
He pulled the goddamn turbine pin!

767
01:44:13,282 --> 01:44:14,749
You just figured that out?

768
01:44:15,918 --> 01:44:18,978
Diaz was gonna take the nodes
for himself and ghost me.

769
01:44:19,889 --> 01:44:21,857
He was gonna leave you out here alone.

770
01:44:22,993 --> 01:44:24,085
So what now?

771
01:44:32,002 --> 01:44:33,731
Now we switch to our ground game.

772
01:44:35,839 --> 01:44:38,365
Let's see if that lack of spine
runs in the family.

773
01:45:31,233 --> 01:45:31,858
Reload!

774
01:45:39,007 --> 01:45:39,837
Watch your head.

775
01:45:50,953 --> 01:45:51,442
Go!

776
01:47:54,853 --> 01:47:55,649
I got inbound.

777
01:48:11,570 --> 01:48:12,332
Take this!

778
01:48:13,573 --> 01:48:14,437
Is it just you?

779
01:48:16,143 --> 01:48:18,168
Just slam this thing in.
See if it's still good.

780
01:48:22,115 --> 01:48:22,604
Boss...

781
01:48:22,716 --> 01:48:25,184
Just see if the fucking thing works!
We need to get outta here.

782
01:52:30,982 --> 01:52:34,146
Extraction, 30 seconds or less.
Let's go, let's go!

783
01:53:06,821 --> 01:53:08,015
Let me ask you something...

784
01:53:09,991 --> 01:53:10,889
sweet-like...

785
01:53:53,371 --> 01:53:54,963
Lot of good men died here, Riddick.

786
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:59,141
Not sure how I'm supposed
to overlook that. Next time.

787
01:53:59,978 --> 01:54:01,809
Yeah. Things would
have been different

788
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:04,144
if they weren't trying
to put my head in a box.

789
01:54:07,253 --> 01:54:08,652
So where to now, Riddick?

790
01:54:09,955 --> 01:54:13,891
You know what? Fuck that. Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.

791
01:54:14,727 --> 01:54:16,718
I'll tell you this, Johns.

792
01:54:17,096 --> 01:54:20,260
Sooner or later,
we all have to head home.

793
01:54:21,301 --> 01:54:23,394
Tell Dahl to keep it warm for me.

794
01:54:24,337 --> 01:54:25,634
And Johns...

795
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:28,940
you keep a strong spine.
