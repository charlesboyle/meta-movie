00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,864
In Napoli

3
00:00:16,936 --> 00:00:20,372
Where love is king

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,035
When boy meets girl

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,045
Here's what they say

6
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:34,215
When the moon hits your eye

7
00:00:34,287 --> 00:00:36,721
Like a big pizza pie

8
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:39,553
That's amore

9
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:45,962
When the world seems to shine
like you've had too much wine

10
00:00:50,303 --> 00:00:53,670
Bells will ring
Ting-a-ling-a-ling

11
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,006
Then you'll sing "Vita bella"

12
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:03,682
Hearts will play
Tippy-tippy-tay

13
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,685
Like a gay tarantella.

14
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:13,684
When the stars make you drool
Just like pasta fazool

15
00:01:18,264 --> 00:01:22,860
When you dance down the street
with a cloud at your feet

16
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:25,199
You're in love

17
00:01:27,273 --> 00:01:30,037
When you walk in a dream

18
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:35,046
But you know
you're not dreaming, signore

19
00:01:36,282 --> 00:01:40,878
'Scusa me, but you see
back in old Napoli

20
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:43,547
That's amore

22
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,042
Lucky fella

23
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,224
He looks great.

24
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:56,227
That AI Conti is a genius.

25
00:02:58,898 --> 00:03:00,593
I am a genius.

26
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:07,331
If you're such a genius, how come
you can't keep track of your receipts?

27
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:11,343
Al, how am I supposed to do
your income tax with this mess here?

28
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:13,845
Numbers, taxes, receipts--

29
00:03:13,913 --> 00:03:18,577
I make them look better
than they did in real life.

30
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:21,176
I'm an artistic genius.

31
00:03:21,254 --> 00:03:23,848
Then how come you got butter
on your tie?

32
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:28,359
Give it here. God.

33
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:31,989
You know what? I give you this.
You make good coffee.

34
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,034
You're a slob,
but you make good coffee.

35
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:37,592
Red roses.

36
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:40,605
Very romantic.

37
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:47,374
The guy that sends these
really knows what he's doing.

38
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,381
The guy who sends those
spends a lot of money...

39
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:52,213
on something that ends up
in the garbage.

40
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:54,651
I'm glad everybody
ain't like you, Loretta.

41
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,486
- I'd be out of business.
- What are you talking? I love flowers.

42
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,003
Thanks, Carmine.

43
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:21,670
- Are you ready?
- Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?

44
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:26,514
- Very good, Mr. Johnny.
- We'll both have the Ticino salad.

45
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:29,282
- And I'll have special fish.
- Good.

46
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:32,654
You don't want the fish. It's the oily
fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.

47
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:35,057
Maybe you're right.

48
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:37,027
We'll have the manicotti.

49
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:40,027
That will be a base
for your stomach.

50
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:42,033
You eat that oily fish,
you go up in the air...

51
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:45,298
halfway to Sicily you'll be green
and your hands will be sweating.

52
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:46,804
You look after me.

53
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:54,910
- You're getting very upset.
- I'm bored with this.

54
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:56,642
- I don't understand.
- Don't ruin the whole evening.

55
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:59,685
- Patricia, please don't leave.
- Do you think I'm a talking doll?

56
00:04:59,752 --> 00:05:03,244
I was just making a point
about the way you said...

57
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:06,883
-the way you stated your aspirations.
-You can kiss my aspirations, Professor!

58
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:12,322
Very clever.
The height of cleverness.

59
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:16,400
Waiter.

60
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:22,499
- Yes?
- Would you do away with her dinner...

61
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:25,339
and any evidence of her,
and bring me a big glass of vodka.

62
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:27,345
But absolutely.

63
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:34,614
A man who can't control his woman
is funny.

64
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:39,486
- She was too young for him.
- What's the matter, Uncle Bobo?

65
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:42,858
Tonight Mr. Johnny's going
to propose marriage.

66
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:45,523
- How do you know that?
- He arranged it with me.

67
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:49,864
When he asks her, he's gonna wave.
Then I serve the champagne.

68
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:55,198
Good bachelor customer
for 20 years.

69
00:06:07,553 --> 00:06:10,579
- How's things?
- Fine, Bobo. We'll have the check.

70
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:12,089
No, l--

71
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:16,657
- I want to see the dessert cart.
- Very good.

72
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,926
- You never have dessert.
- Never is a long time.

73
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,638
What's the matter with you?

74
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,984
My scalp is not getting
enough blood sometimes.

75
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:43,521
- Have some dessert.
- I shouldn't.

76
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:46,080
- Will you marry me?
- What?

77
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:55,632
- Bobo, take the cart away.
- Very good, Miss Loretta.

78
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:57,931
- Are you proposing marriage to me?
- Yes.

79
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,803
All right, you know I was married
and that my husband died...

80
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,969
but what you don't know
is I think he and I had bad luck.

81
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:08,980
- What do you mean?
- We got married at City Hall.

82
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:12,279
-It gave bad luck to the whole marriage.
-I don't understand.

83
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:15,980
Right from the start,
we didn't do it right.

84
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:19,115
- Could you kneel down?
- On the floor?

85
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:20,624
Yeah.

86
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:22,718
- This is a good suit.
- I know that.

87
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:25,491
I helped you pick it out.
It came with two pairs of pants.

88
00:07:25,564 --> 00:07:30,228
It's for luck. A man proposes marriage
to a woman, he should kneel down.

89
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:46,477
She's got him on his knees.
He's ruining his suit.

90
00:07:50,923 --> 00:07:52,788
Is that man praying?

91
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:56,623
- So--
- Where's the ring?

92
00:07:58,531 --> 00:07:59,964
The ring.

93
00:08:00,032 --> 00:08:01,966
A ring. That's right.

94
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:04,969
I would have sprung for the ring
if it was me.

95
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,599
- You can use your pinkie ring.
- I like this ring.

96
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:13,577
You propose marriage to a woman,
you should offer her an engagement ring.

97
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:28,723
Loretta Castorini Clark...

98
00:08:29,895 --> 00:08:33,126
on my knees,
in front of all these people...

99
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:36,701
will you marry me?

100
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:40,500
Yes, John Anthony Cammareri.

101
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:43,133
I will marry you.
I will be your wife.

102
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:05,891
- The check!
- Right away, Mr. Johnny.

103
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,644
What about the wedding?

104
00:09:22,548 --> 00:09:24,482
My mother is dying.

105
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:28,647
When she's dead,
I'll come back and we'll get married.

106
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:30,154
How near death is she?

107
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:33,954
A week. Two weeks.

108
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:37,086
- No more.
- Let's set a date. How about a month?

109
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:39,324
Must it be so definite?

110
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:42,697
Can we just say
we'll be married when I get back?

111
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:44,292
Where?
At the City Hall? No.

112
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:47,469
My mother is dying.

113
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,667
I want a whole wedding
or we'll have bad luck.

114
00:09:49,742 --> 00:09:53,143
For a whole wedding to be planned,
you gotta set a date.

115
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:55,476
All right. A month.

116
00:09:55,548 --> 00:09:57,675
- A month from today.
- In a month.

117
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,848
- From today.
- I'll take care of the whole thing.

118
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:06,448
All you gotta do is show up.

119
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:16,700
Come on.

120
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:22,438
- Call me when you get in.
- I'll call you from Mama's house.

121
00:10:22,508 --> 00:10:25,375
You make me very happy.

122
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:27,912
There's one thing about this wedding
I want you to do.

123
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,381
I want you to call this number.

124
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,850
It's a business number.
You ask for Ronny.

125
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,581
- Invite him to the wedding.
- Who is it?

126
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:40,614
- It's my younger brother.
- You got a brother?

127
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:43,890
We haven't spoken in five years.

128
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:45,555
There was some bad blood.

129
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,826
I want you to call him
and invite him to the wedding.

130
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,333
- Will you do it?
- Sure.

131
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:51,335
International Flight 604
for Rome...

132
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:55,430
with connections to Palermo
is now boarding at Gate 43.

133
00:10:55,507 --> 00:10:57,441
I gotta go.

134
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:59,739
You got your ticket?

135
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:06,149
Here, I got you these:
gum and cough drops.

136
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,516
- Gum opens your ears when you chew it.
- Yeah.

137
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:10,020
I gotta go.

138
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,536
This is the last call
for lnternational Flight 604 for Rome.

139
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:34,713
- You have someone on that plane?
- Yeah, my fiance.

140
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,046
I put a curse on that plane.
My sister is on that plane.

141
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:42,383
I put a curse on that plane
that it's gonna explode...

142
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:45,389
burn on fire
and fall into the sea.

143
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:49,052
Fifty years ago,
she stole a man from me.

144
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:54,830
Today she tells me
that she never loved him...

145
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,835
that she took him
to be strong on me.

146
00:11:57,903 --> 00:11:59,996
Now she's going back to Sicily.

147
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:06,837
I cursed her that the green
Atlantic water should swallow her up!

148
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:09,005
I don't believe in curses.

149
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:11,345
Neither do l.

150
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:38,442
- Mr. Johnny's, right?
- Yeah.

151
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:43,706
Good night.
The key's in it.

152
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:55,592
I've heard that song before.

153
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:59,495
What are you talking about?
I've seen the way you look at her.

154
00:12:59,565 --> 00:13:01,499
- It isn't right.
- How do I look at her?

155
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,501
- Can I help you?
- A spumante.

156
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:06,231
- So how do I look at her?
- Like a wolf.

157
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:16,340
Never seen a wolf in your life.
That's $11.99.

158
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,351
I seen the wolf in everybody
I ever met...

159
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:22,387
and I see a wolf in you.

160
00:13:24,423 --> 00:13:26,357
That makes 20.
Thanks.

161
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:28,359
- Have a nice night.
- You too.

162
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:30,691
- You know what I see in you?
- What?

163
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:34,290
- The girl I married.
- Come on.

164
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:36,698
Good night.

165
00:14:15,507 --> 00:14:17,441
Hi, guys.

166
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:21,172
Sweethearts, how are you?
Guess what happened to me today.

167
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:34,787
Hey, how long must I wait?

168
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,350
Come here!

169
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:42,695
- Hi, Pop.
- Hi.

170
00:14:42,768 --> 00:14:45,134
- Where's Ma?
- In bed.

171
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:49,197
- You're not sleeping?
- I can't sleep anymore.

172
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:51,208
It's too much like death.

173
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:55,805
Pop, I got news.

174
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:57,405
All right.

175
00:14:57,483 --> 00:15:02,648
- Let's go into the kitchen.
- Once again I start to pray

176
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:05,986
Let it please be him

177
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:10,290
Oh, dear God, it must be him

178
00:15:10,362 --> 00:15:12,990
It must be him

179
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:16,159
Or I shall die

180
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:51,035
You look tired, Pop.

181
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:55,362
What's your news?

182
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,677
I'm getting married.

183
00:15:59,745 --> 00:16:02,145
- Again?
- Yeah.

184
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:04,148
You did this once before.
It didn't work out.

185
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:06,150
- The guy died.
- What killed him?

186
00:16:06,218 --> 00:16:08,880
- He got hit by a bus.
- No. Bad luck.

187
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:11,479
Your mother and I were married
52 years. Nobody died.

188
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:13,650
You were married two years,
somebody's dead.

189
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:16,387
Don't get married again.
It don't work out for you.

190
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:19,589
- Who's the man?
- Johnny Cammareri.

191
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:25,635
He's a big baby. And why
isn't he here telling me this?

192
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:27,831
He's flying to Sicily.
His mother is dying.

193
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:32,172
More bad luck. I don't like his face.
I don't like his lips.

194
00:16:32,244 --> 00:16:34,235
When he smiles, I can't see his teeth.
What is he hiding?

195
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:36,008
- When are you gonna do it?
- In a month.

196
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:38,311
- I won't come.
- You gotta give me away.

197
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:41,181
- I didn't give you away the first time.
- And I had bad luck!

198
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:44,188
Maybe if you gave me away...

199
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:46,349
and I got married in a church
in a wedding dress...

200
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:49,690
instead of down at the City Hall
with strangers outside the door...

201
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:52,252
then maybe I wouldn't have had
the bad luck I had.

202
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,189
Maybe.

203
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:58,634
I had no reception,
no wedding cake, no nothing.

204
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:03,106
Johnny got down on his knees
and proposed to me at the Grand Ticino.

205
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:04,972
- He did?
- Yeah.

206
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:07,944
- That don't sound like Johnny.
- Well--

207
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:11,380
- Where's the ring?
- Here.

208
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,078
It looks stupid.
It's a pinky ring.

209
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:16,552
- It's a man's ring.
- It's temporary!

210
00:17:16,622 --> 00:17:19,523
Everything is temporary!
That don't excuse nothing!

211
00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:21,354
You're coming?

212
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:26,323
Let's go tell your mother.

213
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:34,771
Rose.

214
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:44,177
Who's dead?

215
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:46,114
Nobody.

216
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:48,516
- Loretta's getting married.
- Again?

217
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:50,851
- Yeah.
- Johnny Cammareri.

218
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:53,652
- I don't like him.
- You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo.

219
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,124
- Do you love him?
- No.

220
00:17:57,195 --> 00:17:59,789
Good. When you love them,
they drive you crazy...

221
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:02,129
'cause they know they can.

222
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,293
- But you like him?
- Yeah.

223
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:05,961
He's a sweet man, Ma.

224
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:09,804
This time I'm gonna get married
in a church and have a big reception.

225
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,809
- Who's gonna pay for that?
- Pop.

226
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:13,811
What?

227
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:15,471
Father of the bride pays.

228
00:18:15,547 --> 00:18:17,071
I have no money.

229
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:21,279
- You're rich. You're just cheap.
- I don't want to pay for nothing.

230
00:18:21,353 --> 00:18:23,821
It's your duty as my father
to pay for the wedding.

231
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:25,982
I won't pay for nothing.

232
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:27,992
He didn't used to be cheap.

233
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,359
He thinks if he holds onto his money,
he will never die.

234
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,330
What's done is done

235
00:18:33,398 --> 00:18:35,832
And I tell myself
don't be a fool

236
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:39,997
Now he'll play that damn record
and won't touch me when he comes to bed.

237
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:42,165
Have a lot of fun

238
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,573
It's easy when you play it cool

239
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:59,282
Look at that old man.
How many dogs has he got?

240
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:09,224
- Keep your dogs off my lawn.
- Come on.

241
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:24,572
Don't do that.
She's asleep.

242
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:28,244
- She's asleep.
- Look all the flowers on Foncica.

243
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,754
My brother sent her a blue flower.

244
00:19:30,822 --> 00:19:34,849
I can only see things in my house.

245
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:38,828
Things in my house are very bad.
I don't know what to advise my son.

246
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:42,162
I think he should pay
for the wedding...

247
00:19:42,234 --> 00:19:44,259
but it's important
that he don't look ridiculous.

248
00:19:44,336 --> 00:19:48,238
- Why don't you talk to him?
- I will.

249
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:50,706
But I must find the right moment.

250
00:19:50,776 --> 00:19:52,710
See that bella luna last night?

251
00:19:57,582 --> 00:20:02,349
The moon brings the woman
to the man.

252
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:04,848
Upstairs.
Everybody upstairs.

253
00:21:06,985 --> 00:21:08,509
Come on.

254
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:37,214
- Will you live here?
- No.

255
00:21:37,282 --> 00:21:40,046
- Why not?
- Pop don't like Johnny.

256
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:43,220
We'll sell the house.

257
00:21:43,288 --> 00:21:45,722
I got married before,
you didn't sell.

258
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,553
Grandma was still alive.

259
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:52,825
Chiro was still home going to school.
Now he's married, gone to Florida.

260
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:55,492
If you and Johnny moved in
and had a baby--

261
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:58,331
Ma, I'm 37 years old.

262
00:21:58,403 --> 00:21:59,836
What's 37?

263
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:03,341
I didn't have Chiro
till after I was 37.

264
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:05,672
It ain't over till it's over.

265
00:22:07,913 --> 00:22:11,007
Johnny's got a big apartment.
We'll move in there.

266
00:22:11,082 --> 00:22:13,175
So we'll sell the house.

267
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:16,516
You know-- What-- I want to live here.
I love the house.

268
00:22:16,588 --> 00:22:19,022
Pop don't like Johnny.

269
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,523
No, he don't.

270
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:25,762
I'll get it.

271
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:30,867
Hello?

272
00:22:33,271 --> 00:22:36,206
Yeah, this is Loretta Castorini.

273
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,746
Hello, operator?

274
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,216
- Yeah.
- Yes. Shh! It's me.

275
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:52,783
I'm calling from the death bed
of my mother.

276
00:22:52,857 --> 00:22:55,052
Yeah, how was your plane ride?

277
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:58,653
The waitresses were very nice.

278
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,427
- My mother is slipping away.
- How long do I have to wait?

279
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:15,206
-I can't talk long.
-Did you tell her we're getting married?

280
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,809
No, not yet. I'm waiting
till a moment when she's peaceful.

281
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:23,046
Well, don't wait till she's dead.

282
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:24,611
Have you called my brother?

283
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:27,522
No. I'm sorry. Not yet.
I forgot.

284
00:23:27,592 --> 00:23:30,425
- Will you do it today?
- Yes.

285
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:33,521
Make sure he comes to the wedding.

286
00:23:33,598 --> 00:23:36,692
Five years is too long
for bad blood between brothers.

287
00:23:36,768 --> 00:23:39,703
Nothing can replace the family.

288
00:23:41,272 --> 00:23:42,739
I can see that now.

289
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:46,672
Loretta, are you there?

290
00:23:47,946 --> 00:23:50,210
I'm sorry.
I'll do it today.

291
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:52,442
And listen, Johnny.

292
00:23:52,517 --> 00:23:56,317
- Call me after you tell her.
- All right.

293
00:23:56,388 --> 00:24:01,291
And don't stand directly under the sun.
You got a hat. Use your hat.

294
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,159
I got my hat.
All right. Bye.

295
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,720
All right. Bye-bye.

296
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:10,330
What did I do with that card?

297
00:24:11,536 --> 00:24:13,595
How's the mother?

298
00:24:13,672 --> 00:24:16,436
She's dying, but I could still
hear her big mouth.

299
00:24:39,397 --> 00:24:41,297
He didn't tell her.

300
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:44,699
You know,
the woman makes him crazy.

301
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:46,532
Now who you calling?

302
00:24:51,543 --> 00:24:52,976
Cammareri's.

303
00:24:53,044 --> 00:24:56,172
Is Ronny Cammareri there, please?

304
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:57,680
Hold on.

305
00:24:57,749 --> 00:24:59,717
Ronny, the phone!

306
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,517
Yeah, this is Ronny.

307
00:25:03,588 --> 00:25:07,820
Yeah, I'm calling for your brother.

308
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:10,656
He's getting married,
and he would like it if you would come.

309
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:12,390
Why didn't he call himself?

310
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:14,864
- He's in Palermo.
- What's wrong can never be made right.

311
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:17,766
Look, just let me come
and talk--

312
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:21,169
Talk to you! Animal!

313
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,729
What an animal!

314
00:25:45,096 --> 00:25:47,030
Thanks, Mrs. Fugocci.

315
00:25:47,098 --> 00:25:49,862
Here you go.
Bye. See you tomorrow.

316
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:51,868
- Bye.
- Come on, honey.

317
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:54,928
- Is Ronny Cammareri here?
- He's down at the ovens.

318
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:57,668
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to him.

319
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:09,652
This way.

320
00:26:16,728 --> 00:26:19,162
- What?
- Somebody here to see Ronny.

321
00:26:20,832 --> 00:26:23,733
Somebody wants to see you!

322
00:26:43,822 --> 00:26:47,519
- You come for my brother Johnny?
- Yeah.

323
00:26:47,592 --> 00:26:49,492
Why?

324
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:51,552
We're gonna get married.

325
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,601
- You're gonna marry my brother Johnny?
- Yeah.

326
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,297
Would you like to go someplace
so we could talk--

327
00:27:00,371 --> 00:27:02,931
- I have no life.
- Excuse me?

328
00:27:05,543 --> 00:27:08,011
My brother Johnny
took my life from me.

329
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:11,208
I don't understand you.

330
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:15,878
And now he's getting married.
He has his.

331
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:21,316
He's getting his,
and he wants me to come.

332
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:24,294
What is life?

333
00:27:24,362 --> 00:27:28,025
- I didn't come here to upset you.
- They say bread is life.

334
00:27:29,234 --> 00:27:32,897
And I bake bread, bread, bread.

335
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:36,407
I sweat
and shovel this stinking dough...

336
00:27:36,474 --> 00:27:39,034
in and out of this hot hole
in the wall...

337
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:43,911
and I should be so happy, huh, sweetie?

338
00:27:43,982 --> 00:27:46,542
You want me to come to the wedding
of my brother Johnny?

339
00:27:49,854 --> 00:27:51,481
Where's my wedding?

340
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:56,623
Chrissy, bring me the big knife
over by the wall.

341
00:27:59,163 --> 00:28:00,858
I'm gonna cut my throat!

342
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:03,423
Maybe I should come back
another time.

343
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:06,163
No, I want you to see this.
I want you...

344
00:28:06,237 --> 00:28:08,705
to watch me kill myself
so you can tell my brother Johnny...

345
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:11,606
on his wedding day, okay?

346
00:28:13,745 --> 00:28:15,406
I won't do it!

347
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,210
She won't do it.
Do you know about me?

348
00:28:18,283 --> 00:28:20,080
- Mr. Cammareri--
- What?

349
00:28:25,356 --> 00:28:27,381
Okay.

350
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:33,055
Nothing is anybody's fault,
but things happen.

351
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:34,564
Look.

352
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:40,665
This wood is fake.

353
00:28:40,738 --> 00:28:43,263
Five years ago,
I was engaged to be married...

354
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:46,799
and Johnny came in here
and ordered bread from me.

355
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:48,846
I said, "Okay, some bread."

356
00:28:48,913 --> 00:28:52,212
And I put my hand in the slicer...

357
00:28:52,283 --> 00:28:55,411
and it got caught
'cause I wasn't paying attention.

358
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:58,887
The slicer chewed off my hand.

359
00:28:58,957 --> 00:29:02,290
It's funny, 'cause when my fiance
found out about it...

360
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,194
when she found out I had been maimed,
she left me for another man.

361
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:09,967
That's the bad blood
between you and Johnny?

362
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:11,763
Yes, that's it.

363
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:14,066
But that's not Johnny's fault.

364
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:19,933
I don't care!
I ain't no freaking monument to justice!

365
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:23,879
I lost my hand!
I lost my bride!

366
00:29:23,948 --> 00:29:26,644
Johnny has his hand!
Johnny has his bride!

367
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:29,778
You want me to take my heartbreak,
put it away and forget it?

368
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:45,095
Is it just a matter of time...

369
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:47,603
before a man opens his eyes...

370
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:51,502
and gives up his one...

371
00:29:53,978 --> 00:29:58,938
dream of happiness?

372
00:30:07,158 --> 00:30:08,591
Maybe.

373
00:30:29,013 --> 00:30:32,107
This is the most tormented man
I have ever known.

374
00:30:32,183 --> 00:30:33,650
I'm in love with this man...

375
00:30:33,718 --> 00:30:36,881
but he doesn't know that.

376
00:30:36,954 --> 00:30:39,548
I never told him,
'cause he could never love anybody...

377
00:30:39,624 --> 00:30:41,922
since he lost his hand
and his girl.

378
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:50,467
Where do you live?

379
00:30:53,738 --> 00:30:55,171
Upstairs.

380
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:58,308
Can we just talk?

381
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:26,364
What are we painting here,
the Sistine Chapel?

382
00:31:26,437 --> 00:31:29,668
We should have been plumbers
like Castorini.

383
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:48,224
What do you think?

384
00:31:54,732 --> 00:31:56,495
Ten thousand eight hundred dollars.

385
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:59,001
That seems like a lot.

386
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,474
Look...

387
00:32:05,543 --> 00:32:07,841
there are three kinds of pipe.

388
00:32:07,912 --> 00:32:11,006
There's the kind of pipe you have,
which is garbage.

389
00:32:11,082 --> 00:32:13,016
You can see
where that's gotten you.

390
00:32:13,084 --> 00:32:15,848
Then there's bronze,
which is very good.

391
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,512
Unless something goes wrong...

392
00:32:17,588 --> 00:32:20,785
and something always goes wrong.

393
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:26,023
Then there's copper,
which is the only pipe I use.

394
00:32:26,097 --> 00:32:31,160
It costs money
because it saves money.

395
00:32:34,272 --> 00:32:39,869
I think we should follow
Mr. Castorini's advice.

396
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:41,377
Yeah.

397
00:32:50,454 --> 00:32:53,651
And then there's copper...

398
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:56,659
which is the only pipe I use.

399
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:58,820
It costs money.

400
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:01,160
It costs money because...

401
00:33:01,232 --> 00:33:03,496
it saves money.

402
00:33:03,568 --> 00:33:09,165
- What did they say?
- The man understood me.

403
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,142
The woman wanted to be cheap,
but the man saw I was right.

404
00:33:14,478 --> 00:33:18,608
You have such a head for knowing.
You know everything.

405
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,650
I brought you something.

406
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:31,024
It's a present.

407
00:33:39,837 --> 00:33:42,704
Oh, my God.

408
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:46,265
They're little birds and stars.

409
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:52,105
Birds fly to the stars I guess.

410
00:34:35,526 --> 00:34:38,859
- What's that smell?
- I'm making you a steak.

411
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:41,329
- I don't want it.
- You'll eat it.

412
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:44,196
I like it well-done!

413
00:34:44,268 --> 00:34:48,136
You'll eat this one bloody
to feed your blood.

414
00:35:03,554 --> 00:35:05,249
This is good.

415
00:35:08,392 --> 00:35:10,986
- Where'd Johnny find you?
- He knew my husband who died.

416
00:35:11,062 --> 00:35:12,495
- How'd he die?
- A bus hit him.

417
00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:14,656
- Fast?
- Instantaneous.

418
00:35:14,732 --> 00:35:17,860
- When'd you get engaged?
- Yesterday.

419
00:35:17,935 --> 00:35:23,134
So five years ago you got your hand
cut off and your woman left you.

420
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:24,868
- No woman since then?
- No.

421
00:35:25,943 --> 00:35:31,006
- Stupid.
- When your husband get hit?

422
00:35:31,082 --> 00:35:33,016
Seven years ago.

423
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:35,575
- How many men since then?
- Just Johnny.

424
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:39,178
- Stupid yourself.
- Unlucky.

425
00:35:39,256 --> 00:35:41,520
- I've not been lucky.
- I don't care about luck.

426
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:45,858
You understand me?
It ain't that.

427
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:50,367
What's the matter with you? You think
you're the only one who shed a tear?

428
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:52,061
Why are you talking to me?

429
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:01,644
You got any whiskey? How about
you get me a glass of whiskey?

430
00:36:19,397 --> 00:36:20,989
I'll call you later.

431
00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:48,688
- She was right to leave me.
- You think so?

432
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:53,287
- Yeah.
- You really are stupid.

433
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:56,800
You don't know nothing about it.

434
00:36:59,203 --> 00:37:03,299
Look, I was raised
that a girl gets married young.

435
00:37:03,374 --> 00:37:04,966
I held out for love.

436
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:07,135
I got married when I was 28.

437
00:37:07,211 --> 00:37:10,612
I met a man. I loved him.
I married him.

438
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:13,377
He wanted to have a baby right away.
I said we should wait.

439
00:37:13,451 --> 00:37:15,976
Then he gets hit by a bus.

440
00:37:16,053 --> 00:37:19,045
What do I got?
No man, no baby, no nothing.

441
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:22,650
How did I know that man
was a gift I couldn't keep.

442
00:37:22,726 --> 00:37:24,819
My one chance at happiness.

443
00:37:24,895 --> 00:37:28,160
You tell me the story, and you
act like you know what it means...

444
00:37:28,232 --> 00:37:30,792
but I can see what
the true story is and you can't.

445
00:37:30,868 --> 00:37:33,496
That woman didn't leave you, okay?

446
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:37,337
You can't see what you are,
and I see everything. You're a wolf.

447
00:37:38,742 --> 00:37:41,006
- I'm a wolf?
- Yeah.

448
00:37:41,078 --> 00:37:45,845
The big part of you has no words,
and it's a wolf.

449
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:48,680
That woman was a trap for you. She
caught you, and you couldn't get away...

450
00:37:48,752 --> 00:37:51,448
so you chewed off your own foot.

451
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:53,615
That was the price
you had to pay for your freedom.

452
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:55,625
Johnny had nothing to do with it.

453
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:58,025
You did what you had to do
between you and you.

454
00:37:58,095 --> 00:38:00,086
And now you're afraid...

455
00:38:00,164 --> 00:38:02,029
because you know
the big part of you is a wolf...

456
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:04,294
that has the courage
to bite off its own hand...

457
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:06,802
to save itself from the trap
of the wrong love.

458
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:10,329
That's why there's been no woman
since that wrong woman. Okay?

459
00:38:10,407 --> 00:38:12,637
You're scared to death
of what the wolf will do...

460
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,144
- if you make that mistake again.
- What are you doing?

461
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:17,510
- I'm telling you your life.
- Stop it.

462
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:19,776
Why are you marrying Johnny?
He's a fool!

463
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,011
Because I have no luck.

464
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:27,490
He made me look the wrong way,
and I cut off my hand!

465
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:30,152
He could make you look the wrong way.
You could lose your whole head!

466
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:32,195
I'm looking where I have to
to become a bride!

467
00:38:32,263 --> 00:38:36,359
- A bride without a head!
- A wolf without a foot!

468
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:53,110
Wait a minute!

469
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:07,425
What are you doing?

470
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:08,931
Son of a bitch!

471
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:11,934
Where are you taking me?

472
00:39:12,002 --> 00:39:13,435
To the bed.

473
00:39:14,538 --> 00:39:17,132
Oh, God.
Okay, I don't care.

474
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:19,471
Take me to the bed.

475
00:39:19,543 --> 00:39:22,569
- I don't care about anything.
- I don't believe this is happening.

476
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,643
- I was dead.
- Me too.

477
00:39:33,591 --> 00:39:35,821
- What about Johnny?
- You're mad at him.

478
00:39:35,893 --> 00:39:38,726
Take your revenge
out on me.

479
00:39:38,796 --> 00:39:40,730
Leave nothing left
for him to marry.

480
00:39:40,798 --> 00:39:43,824
Leave nothing
but the skin over my bones.

481
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:47,166
All right.
There will be nothing left.

482
00:40:03,854 --> 00:40:05,185
Let's eat while it's hot.

483
00:40:05,255 --> 00:40:07,246
Where's Loretta?
We're eating without her?

484
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:10,452
- She must be eating out.
- She don't know what she's missing.

485
00:40:10,527 --> 00:40:12,688
It's not like her not to call.

486
00:40:12,763 --> 00:40:16,529
She's got a lot on her mind.
We can talk about her, right?

487
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,899
- Everybody knows she's getting married.
- I don't want to talk about it.

488
00:40:23,374 --> 00:40:26,969
I think it's a great idea
and about time.

489
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:30,536
What's she gonna do with the rest
of her life if she don't get married?

490
00:40:30,614 --> 00:40:33,344
I don't want to talk about it!

491
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,144
My father needs another plate.

492
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:44,483
Many years ago,
when they told me...

493
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:47,052
you were marrying my sister...

494
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:48,723
I was happy.

495
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:50,323
When I told Rose...

496
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:52,096
that I was marrying Rita...

497
00:40:52,169 --> 00:40:54,034
she was happy.

498
00:40:54,104 --> 00:40:56,504
Marriage is happy news, right?

499
00:40:58,742 --> 00:41:00,733
Rose, pass the wine.

500
00:41:02,846 --> 00:41:06,304
I never seen anybody so in love...

501
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:09,181
Iike Cosmo was back then.

502
00:41:09,253 --> 00:41:12,620
He'd stand outside the house all day
looking in the windows.

503
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:16,956
I never told you this
'cause it's not really a story...

504
00:41:17,027 --> 00:41:20,485
but one time I woke up
in the middle of the night...

505
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:23,158
'cause of this bright light
in my face...

506
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:24,860
Iike a flashlight.

507
00:41:24,935 --> 00:41:26,800
I couldn't think what it was.

508
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:31,705
I looked out the window,
and it was the moon...

509
00:41:31,775 --> 00:41:33,834
as big as a house.

510
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:37,711
I never seen the moon
so big before or since.

511
00:41:37,781 --> 00:41:41,217
I was almost scared,
like it was gonna crush the house.

512
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:43,048
Then I looked down...

513
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,588
and standing there in the street
was Cosmo...

514
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:48,216
Iooking up at the windows.

515
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:50,692
This is the funny part.

516
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:52,752
I got mad at you, Cosmo.

517
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:56,322
I thought you had brought
that big moon over to my house...

518
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,925
'cause you were so in love...

519
00:41:59,002 --> 00:42:00,902
and woke me up with it.

520
00:42:00,971 --> 00:42:03,269
I was half asleep I guess.
I didn't know any better.

521
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,673
You were altogether asleep.
You were dreaming.

522
00:42:10,214 --> 00:42:11,647
You were there.

523
00:42:12,716 --> 00:42:14,183
I don't want to talk about it.

524
00:42:14,251 --> 00:42:16,515
What do you want to talk about?

525
00:42:16,587 --> 00:42:19,021
Why are you drinking so much?

526
00:42:20,758 --> 00:42:24,285
Old man, you give those dogs
another piece of my food...

527
00:42:24,361 --> 00:42:27,296
I'll kick you
till you're dead.

528
00:43:12,576 --> 00:43:14,669
You drank too much.

529
00:43:14,745 --> 00:43:19,182
You'll sleep too hard, and later
you'll be up when you should be down.

530
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:14,670
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I'm looking at the moon.

531
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:25,180
It's perfect.

532
00:44:25,249 --> 00:44:27,649
I never seen a moon
like that before.

533
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:32,521
Makes you look like an angel.

534
00:44:36,293 --> 00:44:40,855
Looks like a giant snowball.

535
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:45,193
- Rita.
- What?

536
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:48,534
Rita, dear, wake up.

537
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:53,041
Look.

538
00:44:56,713 --> 00:44:59,978
It's Cosmo's moon.

539
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:04,646
What are you talking about?
Cosmo can't own the moon.

540
00:45:04,721 --> 00:45:09,317
It's that moon
I was talking about at dinner.

541
00:45:19,736 --> 00:45:21,226
Is he down there?

542
00:45:21,305 --> 00:45:23,136
Is who down there?

543
00:45:25,776 --> 00:45:29,678
- What would he be doing down there?
- I don't know.

544
00:45:35,419 --> 00:45:38,354
You know something?

545
00:45:38,422 --> 00:45:41,016
In that light...

546
00:45:41,091 --> 00:45:43,355
with that expression
on your face...

547
00:45:45,095 --> 00:45:47,154
you look about 25 years old.

548
00:46:05,549 --> 00:46:08,484
What do you want?

549
00:46:12,723 --> 00:46:14,657
Get out.

550
00:47:02,738 --> 00:47:05,502
Why do you make me wait?

551
00:47:05,574 --> 00:47:07,405
Come on!

552
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:08,909
Howl!

553
00:47:52,688 --> 00:47:55,384
- Oh, my God!
- What?

554
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:57,391
- What?
- Take it easy.

555
00:47:57,459 --> 00:48:00,724
- I was trying to do everything right.
- Don't just become excited.

556
00:48:00,796 --> 00:48:04,562
I thought if I stayed away from City
Hall, I wouldn't have bad luck again.

557
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:07,363
- You're making me feel guilty.
- I'm marrying your brother.

558
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:09,370
All right, I'm guilty.
I confess.

559
00:48:09,438 --> 00:48:11,838
The wedding's in a couple of weeks.
You're invited.

560
00:48:11,907 --> 00:48:15,070
How come you didn't be like him
and be with your mother in Palermo.

561
00:48:15,144 --> 00:48:19,672
- She don't like me.
- You don't get along with anybody.

562
00:48:19,748 --> 00:48:21,875
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

563
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:26,413
- You ruined my life.
- That's impossible!

564
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:29,457
It was ruined when I got here.
You ruined my life.

565
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:32,919
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

566
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:36,927
You got them bad eyes
like a gypsy.

567
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:39,263
I don't know why
I didn't see it yesterday.

568
00:48:39,335 --> 00:48:41,929
Bad luck. That's it.
Is that all I'm ever gonna have?

569
00:48:42,004 --> 00:48:45,940
I should have taken a rock
and killed myself years ago.

570
00:48:46,008 --> 00:48:49,774
I'm gonna marry him. Do you hear me?
Last night never happened.

571
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:53,474
You and I are gonna take this
to our coffins.

572
00:48:53,549 --> 00:48:55,881
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

573
00:48:55,951 --> 00:48:58,181
I'm in love with you.

574
00:49:01,123 --> 00:49:02,556
Snap out of it!

575
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:05,389
- I can't.
- Then I must never see you again...

576
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:10,057
and the bad blood will have to stay
between you and Johnny forever.

577
00:49:10,132 --> 00:49:12,396
- And you won't come to the wedding.
- I'll come to the wedding.

578
00:49:12,468 --> 00:49:15,403
- I'm telling you, you can't come!
- He wants me to come.

579
00:49:15,471 --> 00:49:17,564
That's because he don't know.

580
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,074
Now wait a minute.
Honey, listen.

581
00:49:20,142 --> 00:49:23,578
All right. I won't come
to the wedding, provided one thing.

582
00:49:23,646 --> 00:49:26,911
- What?
- You come with me tonight to the opera.

583
00:49:26,982 --> 00:49:29,576
- What are you talking about?
- I love two things.

584
00:49:29,652 --> 00:49:32,086
I love you, and I love the opera.

585
00:49:32,154 --> 00:49:35,851
If I can have the two things that I love
together for one night...

586
00:49:35,924 --> 00:49:38,256
I would be satisfied
to give up--

587
00:49:38,327 --> 00:49:41,091
Christ.
To give up the rest of my life.

588
00:49:41,163 --> 00:49:42,596
All right.

589
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:46,267
- Meet me at the Met.
- All right.

590
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,173
- Where's the Met?
- You gotta--

591
00:50:19,535 --> 00:50:21,127
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

592
00:50:21,203 --> 00:50:23,637
It's been two months
since my last confession.

593
00:50:23,706 --> 00:50:26,300
What sins have you to confess?

594
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:28,468
Twice I took the name
of the Lord in vain...

595
00:50:28,544 --> 00:50:30,307
once I slept with the brother
of my fiance...

596
00:50:30,379 --> 00:50:32,643
and once I bounced a check
at the liquor store...

597
00:50:32,715 --> 00:50:36,116
- but that was really an accident.
- Then it's not a sin.

598
00:50:36,185 --> 00:50:41,088
But what was
that second thing you said?

599
00:50:42,558 --> 00:50:45,322
The one about once I slept
with the brother of my fiance?

600
00:50:45,394 --> 00:50:49,490
- That's a pretty big sin.
- I know.

601
00:50:49,565 --> 00:50:51,396
- You should think about this.
- I know.

602
00:50:52,363 --> 00:50:57,323
All right. For your penance,
say two rosaries.

603
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:01,670
Be careful, Loretta.

604
00:51:01,739 --> 00:51:03,604
Reflect on your life.

605
00:51:03,674 --> 00:51:05,505
All right.

606
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:35,605
- Hi.
- Where you been?

607
00:51:35,673 --> 00:51:40,372
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Just like your father.

608
00:51:40,444 --> 00:51:42,537
I lied to him.

609
00:51:42,613 --> 00:51:47,050
- He thinks you came home last night.
- Thanks.

610
00:51:51,455 --> 00:51:53,719
What's the matter with you?

611
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:55,816
- Cosmo's cheating on me.
- What?

612
00:51:55,893 --> 00:51:57,827
- Yeah.
- How do you know this?

613
00:51:57,895 --> 00:51:59,988
- A wife knows.
- Mom, you don't even know.

614
00:52:00,064 --> 00:52:03,158
You're just imagining it.
He's too old.

615
00:52:05,569 --> 00:52:07,093
I won't be home for dinner.

616
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:21,017
I feel great.

617
00:52:22,753 --> 00:52:27,383
I got no sleep,
but I feel like Orlando Furioso.

618
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:30,188
You were a tiger last night.

619
00:52:31,929 --> 00:52:35,365
And you were a lamb,
as soft as milk.

620
00:52:35,432 --> 00:52:37,866
Shh! Lower your voice.
They'll hear you in the back.

621
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:41,200
So what? The pleasure of marriage
is you sleep with the woman...

622
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:43,364
- you don't worry about nothing.
- Be quiet, Raymond!

623
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,534
- How about a date tonight?
- What's the matter with you?

624
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:48,544
We'll eat some pasta.
We'll roll around a little.

625
00:52:48,612 --> 00:52:52,207
- What got into you?
- I really don't know.

626
00:52:52,282 --> 00:52:56,651
That crazy moon Cosmo sent over.

627
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,915
Hi, Aunt Rita.
Hi, Uncle Raymond.

628
00:52:58,989 --> 00:53:00,547
Hey, there!

629
00:53:00,624 --> 00:53:03,286
You with the stars in your eyes

630
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,659
- What's the matter with him?
- You got me.

631
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:10,325
You see that moon last night?

632
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:12,835
- What moon?
- Did you see it?

633
00:53:14,505 --> 00:53:17,838
Listen, I gotta go, okay?
I'll take the deposit to the bank...

634
00:53:17,908 --> 00:53:19,535
but I'll come back tomorrow
and do the books.

635
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:22,010
Sure. You got a date.

636
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,047
What are you talking about,
you fool?

637
00:53:24,114 --> 00:53:26,912
Her fiance's in Palermo!
What date?

638
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:28,713
Right.

639
00:53:28,786 --> 00:53:31,687
- I just got a lot of things to do.
- You got all that wedding stuff.

640
00:53:31,755 --> 00:53:33,188
Yeah.

641
00:53:34,925 --> 00:53:36,859
That's romantic too.

642
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:40,021
Isn't it romantic

643
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:44,625
Frankie,
make me a bowl of minestrone!

644
00:53:47,104 --> 00:53:50,039
What's the matter with you?
You look crazy.

645
00:53:50,107 --> 00:53:52,735
- I got a lot on my mind.
- What?

646
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:55,142
- I got a lot--
- Don't tell me that! What's the matter?

647
00:53:55,212 --> 00:53:58,306
- I don't want to talk about it!
- You look like you're nuts!

648
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,484
I don't want to talk about it.

649
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,400
Take out the gray.

650
00:54:22,473 --> 00:54:25,499
I have been wanting to do this
for three years.

651
00:54:25,576 --> 00:54:27,339
Let me show you some magazines.

652
00:54:27,411 --> 00:54:31,507
And you're gonna need a manicure,
yes.

653
00:54:31,582 --> 00:54:33,675
You take her, Batina.
She's gonna take out the gray.

654
00:54:34,918 --> 00:54:37,512
Yeah, and someone will have
to do the eyebrows.

655
00:54:37,588 --> 00:54:40,523
- Look. Something nice and soft.
- Wait a minute.

656
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:43,253
- Has anybody here been to the opera?
- Not me.

657
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:50,529
- Bellissima without those ugly grays.
- It's fantastic.

658
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:54,037
- You ever been to the opera?
- No, have you?

659
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,031
Batina, you ever been to the opera?

660
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:01,100
- This is the color I would use.
- La Boheme?

661
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:03,646
- I've never been there.
- You're going to the Met?

662
00:55:03,714 --> 00:55:05,147
Yeah.

663
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:08,412
She came in when she turned 40
and her husband left her.

664
00:55:11,221 --> 00:55:12,654
- Bye-bye.
- Okay.

665
00:55:27,905 --> 00:55:30,465
Wow. Look at that.

666
00:55:48,425 --> 00:55:49,858
Careful.

667
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,633
I'm home!

668
00:56:00,037 --> 00:56:03,632
Don't everybody answer
at the same time. Hello!

669
00:59:26,476 --> 00:59:28,341
You look beautiful.

670
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,839
- Your hair.
- Yeah, I had it done.

671
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:35,213
You look beautiful too.

672
00:59:35,285 --> 00:59:36,718
Thank you.

673
00:59:40,624 --> 00:59:43,593
I said I'd go to the opera with you,
but that's all.

674
00:59:49,566 --> 00:59:51,500
Come on, let's go in.

675
01:00:07,717 --> 01:00:10,015
- Look at that.
- Isn't it something?

676
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:28,428
Wow. Thank you.

677
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:30,666
For what?

678
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,004
I don't know.
For your hair.

679
01:00:33,076 --> 01:00:35,977
For your beautiful dress.

680
01:00:36,046 --> 01:00:39,846
I don't know. It's been a long time
since I've been to the opera.

681
01:00:44,588 --> 01:00:47,182
- So, where are we sitting?
- Come on.

682
01:01:45,749 --> 01:01:47,182
Here we go.

683
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,030
- So, who's coming?
- Just me. I want to eat.

684
01:02:06,102 --> 01:02:07,729
Okay,
I got a table for you right now.

685
01:02:08,939 --> 01:02:10,873
- This all right?
- Fine.

686
01:02:15,712 --> 01:02:17,646
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

687
01:02:19,316 --> 01:02:22,410
- You dining alone tonight?
- Hello. Yeah.

688
01:02:22,485 --> 01:02:24,680
Let me have a martini,
no ice, two olives.

689
01:02:24,754 --> 01:02:26,654
Very good.

690
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,125
I'm trying to explain to you
how I feel.

691
01:02:32,195 --> 01:02:34,686
Every time I tell you how I feel,
you tell me how you feel.

692
01:02:34,764 --> 01:02:38,791
- That's not much of a response.
- It's the only response I got.

693
01:02:38,868 --> 01:02:41,769
- You want something to eat?
- Not now. I'll wait.

694
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:43,465
Very good.

695
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:46,566
I really hate it
when you use that tone with me.

696
01:02:46,643 --> 01:02:48,941
Like you're above it all
and isn't it so amusing.

697
01:02:49,012 --> 01:02:51,606
- But it is, isn't it?
- Not to me.

698
01:02:51,681 --> 01:02:54,946
This is my life, no matter how comical
it may seem to you.

699
01:02:55,018 --> 01:02:58,283
I don't need some man standing above
the struggle while I'm rolling in mud.

700
01:02:58,355 --> 01:03:00,414
I think you like to roll around
in the mud and I don't.

701
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:02,287
That's fair, isn't it?
Now why--

702
01:03:05,395 --> 01:03:07,295
Oh, my.

703
01:03:14,304 --> 01:03:16,295
Sorry about that, folks.

704
01:03:16,373 --> 01:03:18,807
She's a very pretty
mental patient.

705
01:03:21,945 --> 01:03:23,970
No, don't.
Please, don't mind me.

706
01:03:24,047 --> 01:03:26,811
Just do me a favor
and clear her place.

707
01:03:26,883 --> 01:03:29,647
Get rid of all evidence of her,
and bring me a big glass of vodka.

708
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:31,152
Absolutely.

709
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:38,026
- I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
- I'm not disturbed by you.

710
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:41,856
My lady friend
has a personality disorder.

711
01:03:41,931 --> 01:03:43,899
She's just too young for you.

712
01:03:44,934 --> 01:03:46,492
Thanks, comrade.

713
01:03:46,569 --> 01:03:48,434
It's nothing.

714
01:03:48,505 --> 01:03:52,032
Too young? I just got that.
You know how to hurt a guy.

715
01:03:52,108 --> 01:03:54,008
- How old are you?
- None of your business.

716
01:03:56,046 --> 01:03:58,606
I'm sorry. That was rude.

717
01:04:02,218 --> 01:04:04,152
Would you like to join me
for dinner?

718
01:04:06,689 --> 01:04:08,122
Are you sure?

719
01:04:10,794 --> 01:04:12,284
I'd be delighted.

720
01:04:12,362 --> 01:04:16,196
I hate to eat alone. It's amazing
how often I end up doing just that.

721
01:04:24,941 --> 01:04:26,704
- Signora Castorini.
- Oh, yes.

722
01:04:26,776 --> 01:04:28,903
- Your minestrone.
- Thanks, Bobo.

723
01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:36,341
-What do you do?
-I'm a communication professor at N.Y.U.

724
01:04:36,419 --> 01:04:39,320
- That woman was a student of yours?
- Sheila? Yeah, she was.

725
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:41,721
Is.

726
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,281
Was.

727
01:04:44,561 --> 01:04:46,586
My mother had an old saying.
You want to hear it?

728
01:04:46,663 --> 01:04:48,494
- Sure.
- Don't shit where you eat.

729
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:52,601
I'll remember that.

730
01:04:54,804 --> 01:04:57,272
- What do you do?
- I'm a housewife.

731
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:01,140
- How come you're eating alone?
- I'm not eating alone.

732
01:05:04,013 --> 01:05:06,743
- May I ask you a question?
- Yeah, go ahead.

733
01:05:08,685 --> 01:05:11,085
Why do men chase women?

734
01:05:15,024 --> 01:05:20,326
- Nerves?
- I think it's because they fear death.

735
01:05:23,032 --> 01:05:26,559
Maybe. You want to know
why I chase women?

736
01:05:26,636 --> 01:05:29,264
I find women charming.

737
01:05:29,339 --> 01:05:33,298
I teach these classes
I've taught for a million years.

738
01:05:33,376 --> 01:05:36,971
The spontaneity went out of it
for me a long time ago.

739
01:05:37,046 --> 01:05:39,640
I started out excited about something,
wanted to share it.

740
01:05:39,716 --> 01:05:43,413
Now it's rote,
a multiplication table.

741
01:05:43,486 --> 01:05:49,083
Except sometimes
I'll be droning along.

742
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:52,595
I'll look up,
and I'll see a fresh...

743
01:05:52,662 --> 01:05:54,755
beautiful, young face.

744
01:05:54,831 --> 01:05:56,594
And it's all new to her.

745
01:05:56,666 --> 01:06:01,262
I'm just this great guy
who's brilliant and thinks out loud.

746
01:06:01,337 --> 01:06:03,931
When that happens, when I look
out there among those chairs...

747
01:06:04,007 --> 01:06:08,103
and see a young woman's face...

748
01:06:08,178 --> 01:06:09,941
and see me in her eyes...

749
01:06:10,013 --> 01:06:13,005
the way I always wanted to be,
maybe once was...

750
01:06:14,184 --> 01:06:16,209
I ask her out for a date.

751
01:06:18,521 --> 01:06:20,785
It doesn't last long.

752
01:06:20,857 --> 01:06:24,793
A few weeks.
A couple of precious months.

753
01:06:26,863 --> 01:06:29,798
Then she catches on that
I'm just this burnt-out, old gasbag...

754
01:06:29,866 --> 01:06:33,131
and she's as fresh and bright...

755
01:06:33,203 --> 01:06:37,799
and full of promise
as moonlight in a martini.

756
01:06:45,215 --> 01:06:48,241
At that moment, she stands up and throws
a glass of water in my face...

757
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:51,583
or some action to that effect.

758
01:06:51,654 --> 01:06:54,680
What you don't know about women
is a lot.

759
01:06:57,493 --> 01:06:59,461
That's not what I hear.

760
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:09,763
- What would you like?
- Two white wines.

761
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,272
Yes, sir.

762
01:07:19,515 --> 01:07:21,574
I'd like two glasses
of champagne.

763
01:07:25,855 --> 01:07:29,518
Canadian Club and ginger ale
and Dubonnet on the rocks, please.

764
01:07:29,592 --> 01:07:32,789
- What's that?
- This was done by Marc Chagall.

765
01:07:32,862 --> 01:07:36,127
- As you can see, he was a great artist.
- Kind of gaudy.

766
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:38,463
He was having some fun.

767
01:07:38,534 --> 01:07:43,471
- They get some turnout for this stuff.
- It's the best thing there is.

768
01:07:43,539 --> 01:07:48,169
I like parts of it,
but I don't really get it.

769
01:07:50,546 --> 01:07:53,310
You haven't once said
you like my dress.

770
01:07:53,383 --> 01:07:56,147
I like your dress.

771
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:57,811
It's very bright.

772
01:08:08,731 --> 01:08:11,495
Will you hold this?
Thanks.

773
01:08:11,567 --> 01:08:15,333
- May I walk with you a ways?
- Sure.

774
01:08:15,405 --> 01:08:16,838
Thanks.

775
01:08:19,075 --> 01:08:21,669
- Do you live far from here?
- Just up there.

776
01:09:30,747 --> 01:09:33,511
- You knew that man?
- Yes.

777
01:11:21,657 --> 01:11:24,490
That was so awful.

778
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,825
- "Awful"?
- Beautiful. Sad.

779
01:11:27,897 --> 01:11:29,489
- She died.
- Yes.

780
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:32,659
I couldn't believe it.
I didn't think she was gonna die.

781
01:11:32,735 --> 01:11:34,999
- I knew she was sick, but--
- She had TB.

782
01:11:35,071 --> 01:11:37,665
I know. She was coughing
her brains out, right?

783
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:39,674
And still she had to keep singing.

784
01:11:40,743 --> 01:11:44,008
- Shall we go now?
- Pop?

785
01:11:46,082 --> 01:11:48,607
What are you doing here?

786
01:11:50,686 --> 01:11:52,950
Wait for me by the doors, Mona.

787
01:11:55,024 --> 01:11:56,514
Excuse me.

788
01:12:00,863 --> 01:12:02,990
- What'd you do to your hair?
- I had it done.

789
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:07,635
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

790
01:12:07,703 --> 01:12:09,500
- Who's that guy? You're engaged.
- And you're married.

791
01:12:09,572 --> 01:12:12,040
You're my daughter.
I won't have you act like a putana.

792
01:12:12,108 --> 01:12:14,542
- And you're my father--
- All right.

793
01:12:16,379 --> 01:12:19,780
- I didn't see you here.
- I don't know if I saw you here.

794
01:12:30,393 --> 01:12:32,987
Let's get out of here.
I'll buy you a drink.

795
01:12:33,062 --> 01:12:35,496
That woman
was not my mother, okay?

796
01:12:36,699 --> 01:12:39,167
That's my house.

797
01:12:39,235 --> 01:12:42,329
- You mean the whole house?
- Yes.

798
01:12:42,405 --> 01:12:44,999
My God, it's a mansion.

799
01:12:45,074 --> 01:12:46,598
It's a house.

800
01:12:46,676 --> 01:12:49,770
I live in a one-bedroom apartment.

801
01:12:49,845 --> 01:12:51,938
What exactly
does your husband do?

802
01:12:52,014 --> 01:12:55,609
- He's a plumber.
- That explains it then.

803
01:12:59,855 --> 01:13:01,789
Temperature's dropping.

804
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:05,627
- I guess you can't invite me in.
- No.

805
01:13:05,695 --> 01:13:09,461
- People home.
- No, I think the house is empty.

806
01:13:09,532 --> 01:13:12,968
I can't invite you in
because I'm married...

807
01:13:13,035 --> 01:13:14,798
because I know who I am.

808
01:13:17,873 --> 01:13:20,569
- You're shivering.
- I'm a little cold.

809
01:13:20,643 --> 01:13:24,409
You're a little boy,
and you like to be bad.

810
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:29,144
We could go to my apartment.
You could see how the other half lives.

811
01:13:29,218 --> 01:13:30,845
I'm too old for you.

812
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:34,287
I'm too old for me.
That's my predicament.

813
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:37,658
Good night.

814
01:13:38,894 --> 01:13:41,624
Can I kiss you on the cheek too?

815
01:13:43,265 --> 01:13:44,698
Sure.

816
01:13:52,842 --> 01:13:54,571
I'm freezing.

817
01:13:54,644 --> 01:13:56,077
Good night.

818
01:14:41,057 --> 01:14:42,684
Anything else, folks?

819
01:14:44,727 --> 01:14:46,592
I think that's it, Al.

820
01:14:46,662 --> 01:14:48,254
- See you, Al.
- See you, Carmine.

821
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:58,071
- What do you want to do now?
- I want to go home.

822
01:15:04,847 --> 01:15:07,281
- Good night, Al.
- Take it easy, Ronny.

823
01:15:10,686 --> 01:15:13,280
God, it's cold.

824
01:15:13,355 --> 01:15:15,448
It smells like snow.

825
01:15:15,524 --> 01:15:18,550
You know, my mother guessed
that my father was seeing somebody.

826
01:15:18,627 --> 01:15:22,119
That Mona-- I mean,
she's some piece of cheap goods.

827
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:23,961
Who am I to talk?

828
01:15:25,201 --> 01:15:28,466
- What's the matter?
- How can you ask me that?

829
01:15:28,537 --> 01:15:31,199
- You're making me feel guilty.
- You are guilty. I'm guilty.

830
01:15:31,273 --> 01:15:34,538
Of what?
Only God can point the finger.

831
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:36,134
I know what I know.

832
01:15:36,212 --> 01:15:38,806
And what do you know?

833
01:15:38,881 --> 01:15:42,476
You tell me my life.
I'll tell you yours.

834
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:45,520
I'm a wolf.
You run to the wolf in me.

835
01:15:45,588 --> 01:15:49,547
That don't make you no lamb.
You're gonna marry my brother.

836
01:15:51,494 --> 01:15:54,588
Why you want
to sell your life short?

837
01:15:54,663 --> 01:15:56,927
Playing it safe is just about
the most dangerous thing...

838
01:15:56,999 --> 01:15:59,433
a woman like you could do.

839
01:15:59,502 --> 01:16:02,164
You waited for the right man
the first time.

840
01:16:03,339 --> 01:16:05,273
Why didn't you wait
for the right man again?

841
01:16:05,341 --> 01:16:07,775
- Because he didn't come.
- I'm here.

842
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:09,401
You're late.

843
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:16,284
- This is your place.
- That's right.

844
01:16:16,352 --> 01:16:19,116
- This is where we were going.
- Yeah.

845
01:16:19,188 --> 01:16:21,019
You know, we had a deal.

846
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:23,456
You told me if I came with you
to the opera...

847
01:16:23,526 --> 01:16:25,118
then you'd leave me alone forever.

848
01:16:25,194 --> 01:16:28,960
I came with you.
Now I'm gonna marry your brother...

849
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:31,693
and you're gonna
leave me alone forever, right?

850
01:16:31,767 --> 01:16:35,464
A person can see where
they've messed up in their life...

851
01:16:35,538 --> 01:16:37,972
and they can change
the way they do things...

852
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,065
and they can even change
their luck.

853
01:16:40,142 --> 01:16:42,133
So maybe my nature
does draw me to you.

854
01:16:42,211 --> 01:16:44,145
That don't mean
I have to go with it.

855
01:16:44,213 --> 01:16:46,078
I can take hold of myself.

856
01:16:46,148 --> 01:16:48,582
I can say yes to some things...

857
01:16:48,651 --> 01:16:50,744
and no to other things
that are gonna ruin everything.

858
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:55,757
I can do that.
Otherwise, you know...

859
01:16:55,825 --> 01:16:59,488
what good is this stupid life
that God gave us?

860
01:17:00,596 --> 01:17:04,293
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

861
01:17:05,434 --> 01:17:07,402
Everything seems like nothing
to me now.

862
01:17:07,469 --> 01:17:09,960
I guess I want you in my bed.

863
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:11,973
I don't care
if I burn in hell.

864
01:17:13,275 --> 01:17:15,800
I don't care
if you burn in hell.

865
01:17:15,878 --> 01:17:19,075
The past and the future
is a joke to me now.

866
01:17:19,148 --> 01:17:23,244
I see that they're nothing.
I see they ain't here.

867
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:28,586
The only thing that's here
is you and me.

868
01:17:28,657 --> 01:17:31,683
I want to go home.
I'm going home.

869
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,251
- I'm freezing to death.
- Come upstairs.

870
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:37,060
I don't care why you come.

871
01:17:37,132 --> 01:17:39,760
That's not what I mean.

872
01:17:39,835 --> 01:17:42,395
Loretta, I love you.

873
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:46,470
Not like they told you love is.

874
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:48,703
And I didn't know this either.

875
01:17:48,777 --> 01:17:50,540
But love don't make things nice.

876
01:17:50,613 --> 01:17:54,481
It ruins everything.
It breaks your heart.

877
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:59,487
It makes things a mess.
We aren't here to make things perfect.

878
01:17:59,555 --> 01:18:02,183
The snowflakes are perfect.

879
01:18:05,194 --> 01:18:07,128
The stars are perfect.

880
01:18:07,196 --> 01:18:10,131
Not us.

881
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:13,566
We are here to ruin ourselves...

882
01:18:13,636 --> 01:18:16,400
and to break our hearts...

883
01:18:16,472 --> 01:18:19,464
and love the wrong people...

884
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:21,031
and die.

885
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:23,704
I mean,
the storybooks are bullshit!

886
01:18:25,547 --> 01:18:30,917
Now, I want you to come upstairs
with me and get in my bed!

887
01:18:39,662 --> 01:18:41,095
Come on.

888
01:19:59,308 --> 01:20:02,709
Nineteen Cranberry Street,
Brooklyn.

889
01:20:02,778 --> 01:20:04,211
Got it.

890
01:20:07,783 --> 01:20:09,216
Hold it!

891
01:20:25,234 --> 01:20:26,667
- How much?
- Twenty-five.

892
01:20:26,735 --> 01:20:29,101
- Twenty-five dollars?
- Yeah.

893
01:20:32,841 --> 01:20:34,274
Hold it.

894
01:20:59,134 --> 01:21:01,102
Hi.
I'm sorry to call so late.

895
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:05,004
- Moving in?
- No, I came right from the airport.

896
01:21:05,074 --> 01:21:06,507
Come on in.

897
01:21:13,615 --> 01:21:15,845
Can you wake up Loretta?
I need to talk to her.

898
01:21:15,918 --> 01:21:17,476
She's not home yet.

899
01:21:17,553 --> 01:21:19,953
Take off your coat
and come in the living room.

900
01:21:20,022 --> 01:21:21,990
I'll make you a drink.

901
01:21:22,057 --> 01:21:25,049
I want to talk to you.

902
01:21:33,469 --> 01:21:36,302
- Thank you. Where is she?
- Out.

903
01:21:36,371 --> 01:21:38,396
I don't know where.

904
01:21:38,474 --> 01:21:41,705
So, what are you doing here?

905
01:21:41,777 --> 01:21:43,438
You're supposed
to be in Palermo.

906
01:21:43,512 --> 01:21:47,073
That's what I came to tell Loretta.
There's been a miracle.

907
01:21:48,217 --> 01:21:51,084
A miracle?
Well, that's news.

908
01:21:53,021 --> 01:21:54,784
My mother's recovered!

909
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,425
You're kidding.

910
01:21:58,494 --> 01:22:00,655
The breath had almost totally
left her body.

911
01:22:00,729 --> 01:22:03,163
She was as white as snow.

912
01:22:03,232 --> 01:22:07,692
Then she completely
pulled back from death...

913
01:22:07,769 --> 01:22:09,737
and stood up...

914
01:22:09,805 --> 01:22:12,103
and put on her clothes...

915
01:22:12,174 --> 01:22:15,234
and began to cook
for everyone in the house:

916
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:18,541
the mourners and me and herself.

917
01:22:18,614 --> 01:22:21,708
She ate a meal
that could choke a pig.

918
01:22:21,783 --> 01:22:24,047
- That's incredible.
- Yes.

919
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:30,521
Hi, Pop.

920
01:22:34,163 --> 01:22:35,994
Oh, my God.

921
01:22:37,099 --> 01:22:39,727
Is he all right?

922
01:22:39,801 --> 01:22:42,269
My father-in-law
has this wrong idea...

923
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:43,770
in his head.

924
01:22:45,807 --> 01:22:47,866
Listen, Johnny...

925
01:22:47,943 --> 01:22:50,104
there's a question
I want to ask.

926
01:22:50,179 --> 01:22:53,171
I want you to tell me the truth,
if you can.

927
01:22:55,984 --> 01:22:57,542
Why do men chase women?

928
01:23:03,592 --> 01:23:05,526
There's the Bible story.

929
01:23:06,628 --> 01:23:12,362
God took a rib from Adam
and made Eve.

930
01:23:13,902 --> 01:23:16,632
Now maybe men chase women
to get the rib back.

931
01:23:16,705 --> 01:23:19,765
When God took the rib...

932
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:22,571
He left a big hole there...

933
01:23:22,644 --> 01:23:24,805
a place where there used
to be something.

934
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,542
And the women have that.

935
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,049
Now maybe...

936
01:23:29,117 --> 01:23:30,778
just maybe...

937
01:23:30,852 --> 01:23:34,948
a man isn't complete
as a man...

938
01:23:35,023 --> 01:23:36,547
without a woman.

939
01:23:38,093 --> 01:23:40,027
Why would a man need...

940
01:23:40,095 --> 01:23:42,029
more than one woman?

941
01:23:43,432 --> 01:23:44,990
I don't know.

942
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:48,229
Maybe because he fears death.

943
01:23:49,905 --> 01:23:52,396
That's it.
That's the reason.

944
01:23:52,474 --> 01:23:54,374
I don't know!

945
01:23:56,345 --> 01:24:00,873
Thank you
for answering my question.

946
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:10,253
Hello, Mr. Castorini.

947
01:24:14,529 --> 01:24:17,396
- Where you been?
- I don't know, Rose.

948
01:24:17,466 --> 01:24:19,400
I don't know where I've been
or where I'm going.

949
01:24:19,468 --> 01:24:20,901
All right?

950
01:24:23,272 --> 01:24:25,035
You should have your eyes open.

951
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:27,837
- I have my eyes open.
- Yeah?

952
01:24:27,909 --> 01:24:31,037
Stick around.
Don't go on any long trips.

953
01:24:31,113 --> 01:24:32,774
I don't know what you mean.

954
01:24:32,848 --> 01:24:35,078
I know you don't.
That's the point.

955
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:38,085
- I'll say no more.
- You haven't said anything.

956
01:24:38,153 --> 01:24:40,519
And that's all I'm saying.

957
01:24:40,589 --> 01:24:42,181
- Cosmo.
- What?

958
01:24:42,257 --> 01:24:43,815
I just want you to know...

959
01:24:43,892 --> 01:24:47,851
no matter what you do, you're
gonna die just like everybody else.

960
01:24:49,364 --> 01:24:52,800
- Thank you, Rose.
- You're welcome.

961
01:24:53,869 --> 01:24:55,803
I'm going to bed now.

962
01:24:59,241 --> 01:25:01,573
- I'm going.
- Good.

963
01:25:03,045 --> 01:25:06,606
He doesn't like you,
but thank you for answering my question.

964
01:25:06,682 --> 01:25:09,242
- You don't know where Loretta is?
- No idea.

965
01:25:09,318 --> 01:25:13,277
Mrs. Castorini, will you tell Loretta
that I'll come by in the morning?

966
01:25:13,355 --> 01:25:14,947
We need to talk.

967
01:25:15,023 --> 01:25:17,116
- Okay, I'll tell her.
- Thank you.

968
01:25:23,532 --> 01:25:25,056
Watch it. The house.

969
01:27:01,096 --> 01:27:04,725
- What the hell happened to you?
- I really don't know where to start.

970
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,258
- Your hair's different.
- Ma, everything is different.

971
01:27:09,805 --> 01:27:11,830
- Are you drunk?
- No, are you drunk?

972
01:27:11,907 --> 01:27:14,137
No, but I have a hangover.

973
01:27:14,209 --> 01:27:16,700
- Where's Pop?
- Upstairs.

974
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:20,673
Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.

975
01:27:20,749 --> 01:27:25,448
- What? He's in Sicily.
- No more he's not.

976
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,988
- He's with his dying mother in Sicily.
- She recovered.

977
01:27:28,056 --> 01:27:30,581
- She was dying.
- It was a miracle.

978
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:34,356
This is modern times. There ain't
supposed to be miracles no more.

979
01:27:34,429 --> 01:27:36,897
I guess it ain't modern times
in Sicily.

980
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:39,024
He came right from the airport
to talk to you.

981
01:27:40,769 --> 01:27:43,067
You got a love bite
on your neck.

982
01:27:43,138 --> 01:27:45,368
He's coming back this morning.
What's the matter with you?

983
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,965
Your life's going
down the toilet!

984
01:27:48,043 --> 01:27:51,535
- Cover up that thing! Put makeup on!
- All right!

985
01:27:51,613 --> 01:27:54,138
Ma, okay, fine!
But you got to help me!

986
01:27:54,216 --> 01:27:58,619
- Hurry up!
- Oh, my God.

987
01:27:59,788 --> 01:28:01,221
You get it.

988
01:28:01,289 --> 01:28:05,123
Answer the door! Mother?

989
01:28:13,702 --> 01:28:15,670
Hi. Is Loretta home?

990
01:28:15,737 --> 01:28:17,170
Come on in.

991
01:28:25,747 --> 01:28:27,180
It's not Johnny!

992
01:28:31,253 --> 01:28:33,585
- Is Johnny here?
- No, but he's coming.

993
01:28:33,655 --> 01:28:36,647
Good. We can get this out
on the table.

994
01:28:36,725 --> 01:28:39,523
Hi, I'm Ronny,
Johnny's brother.

995
01:28:39,594 --> 01:28:41,960
I'm Rose Castorini.

996
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:45,466
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

997
01:28:45,534 --> 01:28:47,934
Got a love bite
on your neck.

998
01:28:48,003 --> 01:28:51,837
- Your mother's recovered from death.
- Good.

999
01:28:51,907 --> 01:28:55,673
- We're not close. I'm not really moved.
- You gotta get outta here.

1000
01:28:55,744 --> 01:28:58,645
- I'm here to meet the family.
- Really, you gotta get outta here.

1001
01:28:58,713 --> 01:29:00,647
Anyone want some oatmeal?

1002
01:29:00,715 --> 01:29:02,148
- No, Ma.
- Yes, Mrs. Castorini.

1003
01:29:02,217 --> 01:29:05,675
- I would love some oatmeal.
- No, we don't want any oatmeal!

1004
01:29:05,754 --> 01:29:09,315
- Take your coat off. Sit down.
- Ma! What? This is a--

1005
01:29:10,392 --> 01:29:13,589
- Thanks, Ma.
- You're welcome.

1006
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:19,125
Cosmo, this is Ronny,
Johnny's brother.

1007
01:29:21,202 --> 01:29:23,500
It's very good to meet you.

1008
01:29:26,074 --> 01:29:29,339
I have a feeling
this is going to be just delicious.

1009
01:29:31,346 --> 01:29:34,406
- You're Johnny's brother?
- Yeah.

1010
01:29:40,789 --> 01:29:43,417
- Don't look at me like that.
- Hi, Pop.

1011
01:29:54,903 --> 01:29:57,064
What's the matter, Pop?

1012
01:29:57,138 --> 01:29:58,571
I am old.

1013
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:01,165
The old are not wanted.

1014
01:30:01,242 --> 01:30:04,006
And if they say it,
they have no weight.

1015
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:08,880
But, my son, I must speak.

1016
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:12,442
You must pay for the wedding
of your only daughter.

1017
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:16,718
You break your house
through pride.

1018
01:30:16,791 --> 01:30:20,249
There. I've said it.

1019
01:30:20,328 --> 01:30:22,853
It's okay, Pop.

1020
01:30:22,931 --> 01:30:25,525
If she gets married,
I'll pay for the whole thing.

1021
01:30:30,872 --> 01:30:32,806
Now you talking.

1022
01:30:37,779 --> 01:30:39,212
Let's eat.

1023
01:30:47,288 --> 01:30:51,452
- Have I been a good wife?
- Yeah.

1024
01:30:55,163 --> 01:30:57,461
I want you to stop seeing her.

1025
01:31:32,333 --> 01:31:33,891
And go to confession.

1026
01:31:36,905 --> 01:31:42,002
A man understands one day
that his life is built on nothing...

1027
01:31:42,077 --> 01:31:44,841
and that's a bad, crazy day.

1028
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:53,286
Your life is not built on nothing.

1029
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,254
- It's Johnny. I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

1030
01:32:27,322 --> 01:32:29,586
- I think I should tell him.
- I'll tell him.

1031
01:32:29,657 --> 01:32:34,321
- What am I gonna tell him?
- Tell him the truth.

1032
01:32:34,395 --> 01:32:37,660
- They find out anyway.
- You're right, Pop.

1033
01:32:50,678 --> 01:32:52,168
Why aren't you at the store?

1034
01:32:53,515 --> 01:32:55,176
Do you have something
you want to tell us?

1035
01:32:59,687 --> 01:33:01,917
We just come from the bank.

1036
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:03,457
Yeah?

1037
01:33:04,893 --> 01:33:07,623
My God! The bank!
I forgot to make the deposit!

1038
01:33:07,695 --> 01:33:10,789
- She's got it!
- I knew she had it!

1039
01:33:10,865 --> 01:33:12,799
- We didn't know what to think.
- I forgot!

1040
01:33:12,867 --> 01:33:14,300
It was so weird yesterday.

1041
01:33:14,369 --> 01:33:18,465
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Then we went to the bank and no bag.

1042
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:21,634
- We never suspected you.
- Would anyone like some coffee?

1043
01:33:21,709 --> 01:33:23,973
- Yes, coffee.
- That's a good idea.

1044
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:28,444
- What's with this?
- I'll tell you later.

1045
01:33:28,516 --> 01:33:32,316
- I forgot to make their deposit.
- Here, sit down. Have some coffee.

1046
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:48,992
- So what are we doing?
- Waiting for Johnny Cammareri.

1047
01:33:51,506 --> 01:33:55,306
- My name's Ronny.
- Johnny's brother.

1048
01:33:56,678 --> 01:33:59,272
Nice to meet you.
I'm Rita Cappomaggi.

1049
01:33:59,347 --> 01:34:02,783
- Hi.
- Raymond Cappomaggi, Rose's brother.

1050
01:34:16,364 --> 01:34:18,992
Someone tell a joke.

1051
01:34:25,974 --> 01:34:27,407
I'll get it.

1052
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:38,051
I thought Johnny was in Palermo.

1053
01:34:43,224 --> 01:34:44,987
It's Johnny Cammareri.

1054
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:02,776
- Have you come to make peace with me?
- Yes.

1055
01:35:02,844 --> 01:35:07,611
But you may not want to.

1056
01:35:07,682 --> 01:35:09,479
Ronny, of course I want to.

1057
01:35:09,550 --> 01:35:12,348
But, Johnny, your mother was dying.
How did she recover?

1058
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:16,049
I told my mother we were to be married,
and she got well right away.

1059
01:35:16,124 --> 01:35:18,115
- I'm sure she did.
- It was a miracle.

1060
01:35:18,192 --> 01:35:20,126
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

1061
01:35:20,194 --> 01:35:24,790
- I have something I have to tell you.
- And I have something to tell you...

1062
01:35:24,866 --> 01:35:29,496
- but I must talk to you alone.
- I need my family around me now.

1063
01:35:34,409 --> 01:35:37,173
- I can't marry you.
- What?

1064
01:35:37,245 --> 01:35:38,872
If I marry you,
my mother will die.

1065
01:35:38,947 --> 01:35:41,142
What the hell are you talking about?
We're engaged.

1066
01:35:41,215 --> 01:35:44,150
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about a promise.

1067
01:35:44,218 --> 01:35:45,776
- He proposed!
- Because my mother was dying.

1068
01:35:45,853 --> 01:35:48,048
Now she's not!

1069
01:35:48,122 --> 01:35:50,886
You're 42 years old.
She's still running your life.

1070
01:35:50,959 --> 01:35:52,950
You are a son
who doesn't love his mother!

1071
01:35:53,027 --> 01:35:56,087
You are a big liar!
Because I have a ring right here.

1072
01:35:56,164 --> 01:36:00,601
- I must ask for that back.
- All right, the engagement is off.

1073
01:36:00,668 --> 01:36:03,535
- In time you will see this is best.
- In time you'll drop dead...

1074
01:36:03,604 --> 01:36:06,095
and I'll come to your funeral
in a red dress!

1075
01:36:06,174 --> 01:36:08,108
What?

1076
01:36:08,176 --> 01:36:09,643
Will you marry me?

1077
01:36:09,711 --> 01:36:13,044
- What?
- Where's the ring?

1078
01:36:17,185 --> 01:36:19,278
Can I borrow that ring?

1079
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:25,224
Thanks.

1080
01:36:36,871 --> 01:36:38,361
Will you marry me?

1081
01:36:41,009 --> 01:36:44,172
Yes, Ronny. In front
of all these people, I'll marry you.

1082
01:36:44,245 --> 01:36:46,611
- Do you love him, Loretta?
- Ma, I love him awful.

1083
01:36:46,681 --> 01:36:48,615
God, that's too bad.

1084
01:36:50,685 --> 01:36:52,118
She loves me.

1085
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,294
What's the matter, Pop?

1086
01:37:01,362 --> 01:37:03,728
I'm confused.

1087
01:37:13,508 --> 01:37:14,941
To Loretta and Ronny!

1088
01:37:21,015 --> 01:37:22,448
Come on. There.

1089
01:37:28,956 --> 01:37:30,389
Come.

1090
01:37:30,458 --> 01:37:33,188
- Your brother is here and you're--
- I don't want any.

1091
01:37:33,261 --> 01:37:35,525
You're part of the family.
Don't you realize?

1092
01:37:35,596 --> 01:37:37,427
Come on, please.

1093
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:44,738
Everybody, come on.
Glass in hand.

1094
01:37:50,545 --> 01:37:53,480
To the family!
