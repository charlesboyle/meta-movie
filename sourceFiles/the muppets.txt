1
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,970
<i>That's me, Walter.</i>

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,849
Where... Where'd you go?
Oh, there you are!

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,765
<i>I have the best life
in the whole world.</i>

4
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,882
<i>That's my brother, Gary.</i>

5
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,520
<i>He's the best friend
you could ever have.</i>

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,524
<i>Yeah, I know what
you're thinking.</i>

7
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,284
<i>We could be twins.</i>

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,127
<i>Smalltown...</i>

9
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,287
<i>...the best town you
could ever grow up in.</i>

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,885
<i>Gary and I did
everything together.</i>

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,049
<i>And, as the years passed, my
brother was always there for me.</i>

12
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,602
I got it! Gary, throw me!
Throw me!

13
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,125
Aaah!

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,810
<i>We were a great team.</i>

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,645
- Nice job, Walter.
- Thanks, Gary.

16
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,486
<i>Oh, don't get me wrong.
It's not perfect.</i>

17
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,530
<i>- That was so fun!
- Nothing is.</i>

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,761
Sorry, kid.

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,241
- I wanna do that again!
- Come on. I'll ride with ya!

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,640
Hurry up!

21
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,646
<i>Even the sunniest days can
have a few clouds in them.</i>

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,608
Ride's bogus, anyway.
Hey, wanna rent a video?

23
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,366
Yeah. Race you home!

24
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,605
<i>And, well, that night sorta
changed everything.</i>

25
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,724
<i>It's The Muppet Show, with our very
special guest star, Mr. Steve Martin!</i>

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,809
<i>I found them...</i>

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,640
<i>The Muppets.</i>

28
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,684
<i>I guess you could say I was
their number one fan.</i>

29
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,329
Oh, Gary, it's an entire
map of The Muppet Studios.

30
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,089
<i>And they made all
the difference.</i>

31
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,641
<i>- Trick or treat!
- Because from then on...</i>

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,245
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Gary.

33
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,126
- Hey.
- Hi-ho, guys. Yay!

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,526
Is that Kermit the Frog?
What is this, 1978?

35
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,126
<i>...even on the worst
days, I knew...</i>

36
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,767
<i>...that as the years passed...</i>

37
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,570
<i>Cancel that last remark.</i>

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,769
<i>...as long as there are singing
frogs and joking bears...</i>

39
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,481
<i>...Swedish chefs and
boomerang fish,</i>

40
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,326
<i>the world can't be such
a bad place after all.</i>

41
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,371
All right, good night, buddy.

42
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,562
Oh, good night, Gary.

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,041
<i>And as long as there
are Muppets...</i>

44
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,407
<i>- ...for me...
- ...hair-growing tonic.</i>

45
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,449
<i>...there's still...</i>

46
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,046
<i>- ...hope.</i>

47
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,081
Aaah. Bye-bye!

48
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,164
<i>Somebody get him!</i>

49
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,560
Animal. Hey, Animal, come on.
The show's about to start.

50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,802
Show! Show!

51
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,409
<i>Hey, Walter, why
don't you join us?</i>

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,130
<i>Come on!</i>

53
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,685
No! Wait! I want to be with you guys!
Please let me in!

54
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,411
Kermit!

55
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,965
Whoa!

56
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,360
Walter, are you OK, buddy?

57
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,171
You're drenched in sweat.
Did you have the dream again?

58
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,082
Ummm. No. Hey, so when are
you guys leaving today?

59
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,408
Oh, um, just a couple hours now.

60
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,122
Oh, wow, Gary, I think it is so cool
you're taking Mary to Los Angeles.

61
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,682
I can't believe you guys have
been dating for ten years.

62
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,286
I know. Yeah, she wanted to do something
special for this anniversary,

63
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,920
and she's always wanted
to see Los Angeles, so...

64
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,651
Hey, don't forget to send me a
postcard from The Muppet Studios.

65
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,684
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

66
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,606
- I can't do that, Walter.
- But, Gary...

67
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,842
Because...
you're coming with us!

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,243
Qh, Gary!

69
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,363
- But what about Mary?
- She's fine.

70
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,684
- She said the more the merrier.
- <i>I...</i> I don't know what to say!

71
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,003
The Muppet Studios are there, Gary.
I can't believe this!

72
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,646
Better get a move on.
We don't want to miss that bus!

73
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,600
No way! Who knows?
Maybe Kermit will be there.

74
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,524
I wouldn't get your
hopes up, buddy.

75
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,081
The Muppets haven't put on
a show together in years.

76
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,846
I don't think they use the studios
for anything but tours any more.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,446
Nah, I think that's
just an Internet rumor.

78
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,250
Like there's a country
called Turkey.

79
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,925
Walter, how many times do
we have to go over this?

80
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,082
- Turkey is a very real country.
- Wow, Muppet Studios.

81
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,163

All right, Carlos.
Flip the ignition.

And that is how you fix
a 12-volt starter.

130
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,406
- Oh!

131
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,001
You know what that means.
Spring break.

132
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,448
It's OK. We'll be back to
studying in two weeks.

- Thanks.

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,411
Enjoy your anniversary dinner.

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,688
- Hi.
- I got you these.

139
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,322
Oh. Sorry. It's probably from
the dance number I was doing.

140
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,482
It's OK. They're really sweet.

141

I have our list.

Walter can't wait either.

You don't mind that
he's coming, right?

147

No. No, of course not.

175
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,171
OK, they're gone!

176
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,287
Hey, Gary, what should we
do first at Muppet Studio?

177
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,410
Cause I was thinking that maybe we
could start at Fozzie's Joke Room...

178
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,647
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.

179
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,087
The lines might be shorter at
Honeydew's Laboratory of Fun

180
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,086
so maybe we should start there instead I just...
I just can't wait!

181
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,322
Oh, Walter, don't be nervous.

182
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,927
Oh, I know.
I just can't believe I'm here.

183
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,003
The home of the Muppets!

184
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,207
What...
What happened to this place?

185
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,962
Where...?

186
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,091
- Where is everyone, Gary?
- I don't know, buddy. It's so...

187
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,085
OK, well, I guess you
guys are it for today.

188
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,006
Anyway, welcome to the
original Muppet Studio,

189
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,811
where dreams can come true.

190
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,727
- Is this the Universal Studios?
- Yes, it is.

191
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,168
OK, now if you'll just
follow me, please.

192
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,969
OK. This used to be
Kermit's office.

193
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,963
- Whoa.
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,849
It's really the
highlight of the tour.

195
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,690
You should see it sometime.

196
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,242
OK, this next building is
where they kept the rope

197
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,327
and the medium-gauge wire for the productions.
Let's go take a look.

198
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,171
- Come on, buddy.

199
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,483
Wow!

200
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,884
Oh, boy.

201
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,762
Oh.

202
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,564
Whoa.

203
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,002
There. Now this here is
Kermit the Frog's old office.

204
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,288
- Or so we've been "toad."

205
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,970
Well, as you know, gentlemen, I've
loved the Muppets since I was a boy.

206
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,888
And what better way
to honor the Muppets

207
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,045
than to make this beautiful
studio a Muppet museum.

208
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,529
I think I'll call this room

209
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,843
the "Kermit the Frog's
Old Office Room."

210
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,809
- Oh, that is lovely.
- Oh, good one, Mr. Richman.

211
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,885
Now, this here is the standard
"Rich and Famous" contract

212
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,651
Kermit signed 30 years
ago, that contains...

213
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,929
- The deed to this property.
- Exactly.

214
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,530
Now, this contract is 100 percent
ironclad, with one minor exception.

215
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,490
If the Muppets can raise the ten
million dollars it would cost

216
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,047
to buy the building before
this contract expires,

217
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,329
- then they get their studio back.
- You know, if I didn't know better,

218
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,330
I'd say you were reciting some
sort of an important plot point.

219
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,444
Well, I hope so. Otherwise, I just
bored the audience half to death.

220
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,602
You mean half the
audience is still alive?

221
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,726
It's nice doing
business with you.

222
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,884
- Yes, sir. Come on.
- Goodbye.

223
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,008
I love geriatric humor.

224
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,603
Gentlemen, there's oil
under this studio.

225
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,885
- Yeah, I can smell it.

226
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,687
And more importantly, the geological
survey says there definitely is.

227
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,168
In two weeks, we tear
this place to the ground

228
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,563
and start drilling.
Ah, those Muppets

229
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,446
They think they're so funny.

230
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,645
Well, it looks like the
joke's about to be on them.

231
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,326
- Maniacal laugh.

232
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,170
Maniacal laugh.

233
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,323
Maniacal laugh. Maniacal laugh.

234
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,967
- Maniacal laugh.

235
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,204
- Walter!
- Walter?

236
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,600
- Walter!
- Walter!

237
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,685
Yeah, so then, when he thought
they were alone, he said,

238
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,127
"There's oil under
this studio, see.

239
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,567
I'm gonna tear it
to the ground, see.

240
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,008
- Sweet, sweet oil, see!"
- People still talk like that?

241
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,889
Maybe that's just how
he sounded in my head.

242
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,601
Either way, we've got to find Kermit!
He'll know what to do.

243
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,001
How do we find Kermit?
Nobody's seen him in years.

244
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,000
Stop the car! I've got an idea!

245
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,170
Mmm.

246
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,765
These are delicious!

247
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,729
- Great idea, Walter.
- Mm-hmm.

248
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,284
We've been doing this
for a long time.

249
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,771
I think maybe we should
call it a night.

250
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,207
Guys! - We can't give up, Gary.

251
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,170
But it's getting really late.
Maybe we should just go back to the motel.

252
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,129
- Guys!
- It...

253
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,486
- What?
- What?

254
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,362
- Maybe he lives there.
- Oh. That's it.

255
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,360
So, what do we do now?

256
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,611
I don't see a doorbell, and
the house looks empty.

257
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,524
- Gary, throw me over.
- What?

258
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,002
- Gary, just throw me over already!
- OK.

259
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,687
- OK, here we go. <i>OK...</i>
- One, two, three.

260
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,451
- That's good.
- Sorry.

261
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,931
- No, it's good.
- Guys?

262
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,128
I think that's an
electric fence.

263
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,611
Mary, it's Kermit the Frog.

264
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,486
- OK, buddy, head down.
- One, two, three!

265
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,728
- It's an electric fence.
- Yep.

266
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,681
Oh, my gosh. Walter? Walter, buddy?
Walter, can you hear me?

267
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,446
Throw me again. - No, I don't...

268
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,568
I don't think
that's a good idea.

269
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,166
- What kind of throw was that?
- I think there's somebody coming.

270
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,765
Excuse me...

271
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,164
You OK? That was quite a tumble.

272
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,160
Oh. Look, look. I think...

273
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,288
Hey. Hey, Walter?

274
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,444
- Walter, you all right, buddy?
- Where am I?

275
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,282
OK, this is awesome.
We're at Kermit's house.

276
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,723
- Oh, jeez. Walter.
- No, no, no, no, no. You OK?

277
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,370
This... This is Kermit's house?

278
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,009
- Anyhow, how can
I help you guys?

279
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,931
Let me just say, this is an honor
for all of us to meet you, sir,

280
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,248
but my brother, Walter, has some
really disturbing news for you.

281
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,166
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
- Not now, 80's Robot.

282
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,846
Might I offer you a drink? Tab?

283
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,240
Good grief. - New Coke?

284
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,687
Listen. Not right now,
80's Robot, please!

285
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,450
Bummer.

286
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,931
Watch out for the...
- Gag me with a spoon.

287
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,969
Yeah, head for the door.
- Grody to the max.

288
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,771
- Ow.

289
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,565
Ow.

290
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,643
- I'm really sorry about that...

291
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,961
...Walter. What were you saying?

292
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,681
- Yes. Tex Richman, the oil baron, <i>is...</i>
- Yes, yes, yes.

293
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,763
Oil baron Tex Richman, the
wealthy philanthropist.

294
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,241
You know, he's about to buy
our old Muppet Show theater

295
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,368
and turn it into a Muppet museum.
Isn't that great?

296
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,729
- No! I mean...
- What Walter's trying to tell you

297
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,646
is that Tex Richman has a secret plan to
tear down the theater and drill for oil.

298
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,768
- What?
- The only way to save the studio

299
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,201
is to raise ten million dollars.

300
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,409
Ten million dollars?
That's impossible.

301
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,846
- But...
- The only way to raise

302
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,365
that kind of money
would be to...

303
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,203
...would be to put on a show.

304
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,526
And I haven't seen the old
gang in a long, long time.

305
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,367
I guess people soft
of forgot about us.

306
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,646

of using my modem to
locate the Muppets.

it fresh each night.

00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,564
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, I'm Fozzie, by the way.

389
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,564
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is Gary and Mary.

390
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,849
And this here is Walter.
He's a personal friend.

391
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,844
- Yeah.
- So I said, "What are you looking at?"

392
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,322
So I punched him in the face!
I mean...

393
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,245
- Let's talk in my dressing room.
- Sure.

394
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,563
- OK.
- Here we are.

395
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,046
Make yourselves at home.

396
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,641
- Wow.

397
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,726
This is not quite
what I expected,

398
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,527
- based on your Christmas cards.
- Oh, yeah. About that...

399
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,684
Oh, but it's nice, and...
and airy.

400
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,808
Maybe we should give
them some space.

401
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,849
I know, but I wanna hear
what they're gonna say. OK.

402
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,162
Sixty-four shows nightly
can get pretty grueling.

403
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,881
Fozzie, an evil oil baron wants to
tear down our old Muppet studio.

404
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,486
- What? Oh, no!

405
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,530
- I mean, that's a shame.

406
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,365
Step out of the vehicle!

407
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,329
Hey, Fozzie...

408
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,766
I'm sorry I haven't
been in touch more.

409
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,084
It's fine, Kermit. Look at me!
Living the dream!

410
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,366
- Uh-oh.

411
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,251
Oh, no! Not this again!

412
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,051
- Quick, save the cushions!
- The cushions?

413
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,890
I'm sorry, Fozzie.

414
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,168
If I'd known you were
here in this place...

415
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,369
That's all right, Kermit.
It's not your fault.

416
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,042
- We had a good run.
- Yeah.

417
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,248
Yeah, it's just that...

418
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,287
Well, we haven't seen each other
in a really long time, and I...

419
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,125
I just thought maybe we could raise
the money to buy the theater back

420
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,529
if we all got together and
put on one last show.

421
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,401
A show? But I've spent years
building a solo career.

422
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,803
I have a whole new show-biz
family that loves me.

423
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,721
Fozzie! What the heck are
you doing, hibernating?

424
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,082
Next show starts in 30 seconds.

425
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,122
We hired you, and we can fire you,
so get your butt in here now!

426
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,691
- They terrify me. Let's go.
- Let's go.

427
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,850
- Watch out for the forklift, Fozzie.
- Oh, thanks.

428
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,367
Wow! Gonzo's doing really well!

429
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,601
According to 80's Robot,

430
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,206
he's the richest plumbing
magnate in the Rust Belt.

431
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,371
You! Order 28,000 tons of
plumber's putty from Beijing.

432
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,444
Right away, sir.
- And, you, send the 28,000 tons

433
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,250
of Silly Putty back to Beijing.

434
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,925
You bet. - Oh, and you?

435
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,441
A memo to the waterless
toilet department.

436
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,206
I don't care about the
mess, just keep trying.

437
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,649
- Hi, Gonzo.
- Kermit? Fozzie? This is a surprise.

438
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,049
- We need to speak to you.
- All right. Have a seat.

439
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,163
Ah. Thank you!

440
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,769
- I think I'll stand.
- No, really, you should try one! Comfy.

441
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,365
It's our executive
line of used toilets.

442
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,523
Anyway, I'm very busy.
I've got 30 seconds. Go.

443
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,170
Uh... Gonzo, I'm not quite
sure how to say this, but...

444
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,964
Don't forget to mention
the evil oil baron.

445
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,521
Yes, Fozzie, I was about to.
Just give me a moment, OK?

446
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,682
Gonzo, it would appear...

447
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,365
Remember, evil oil baron.

448
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,046
Fozzie, I'm going to get to that.
Please!

449
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,248
- As I was trying to say...
- Evil oil baron.

450
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,529
- OK, time's up.
Thank you, guys.

451
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,481
Gonzo, we're trying to get the
old gang back together again.

452
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,440
- We really need you.
- My answer is no. Good day!

453
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,687
Come on, guys. We should go.

454
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,804
I just want to say, when I was
a kid, I saw you recite Hamlet

455
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,645
while jumping your motorbike
through a flaming hoop, and...

456
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,247
...it made me feel like
I could do anything.

457
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,404
Thank you. Yeah.

458
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,521
- Good try, Walter.
- Hey, guys, up here!

459
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,569
- Ya-haa!
- Huh?

460
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,526
I've been wearing this under my
suit every single day for years!

461
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,085
Look out below!

462
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,805
Whoa, where you going?
You threw me off-balance!

463
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,328
I can't see! Apollo 13!

464
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,169
Citizens of Earth, the
Great Gonzo is back.

465
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,728
I pledge never to
hold a plunger again!

466
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,723
Run! Run! Run for your lives!
Run, run, run!

467
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,010
- Run, guys!
- Run!

468
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,491
Oh, my gosh, run everybody!

469
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,530
It's gonna be big!
It's gonna be a big one!

470
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,929
Wow! That was an expensive
looking explosion!

471
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,526
I can't believe we had
that in the budget.

472
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,451
So maybe if you look
inside yourself,

473
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,650
the person you should be
most angry at is you.

474
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,847
Is you.

475
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,686
How have you been feeling?
Any more control issues?

476
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,446
In control.

477
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,602
- Good. Psst. Animal!

478
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,923
Excellent. - It's me, Kermit.

479
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,290
Hey, we're having a meeting here, man.
You're being really rude, frog!

480
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,489
Pardon us, please.
Animal, I need to talk to you for a second.

481
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,605
We're getting the Muppets back together.
We need you to drum again.

482
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,330
- Animal drum?
- Yes!

483
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,488
- Please, sir.
- Drum! Drum, drum!

484
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,802
- Drum, drum, drum!
- OK, OK.

485
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,051
- In control.
- Good.

486
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,487
I'm Animal's
court-appointed sponsor

487
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,803
We don't use the "d-r-u-m" word.

488
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,008
- It's his trigger word.
- His trigger word?

489
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,521
Excuse me, Mr. Black.
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

490
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,762
but it's very important to these
guys that they get their drummer...

491
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,721
Gary!

492
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,530
It's my trigger word, too.

493
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,446
Jack, we talked about
this on Tuesday.

494
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,841
Tuesday's another one
of my trigger words!

495
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,085
Oh, I don't think so!

496
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,166
Sorry.

497
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,084
- Let's go, Animal.
- Bye-bye!

498
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,323
- Animal, heel.
- Go, Animal! Be free, man!

499
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,161
But remember! No drumming!

500
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,086
Mr. Kermit, may I suggest
we save time and pick up

501
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,402
the rest of the Muppets
using a montage?

502
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,688
Great idea, 80's Robot.

503
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,404
We greatly appreciate
your financial support.

504
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,610
Eighty-seven point three miles to go.
Eighty-seven point two...

505
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,489
80's Robot, do you
have to do that?

506
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,324
...the secrets of
the universe...

507
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,886
I guess we're in.

508
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,683
<i>Welcome to this week's edition
of "Everything Stinks."</i>

509
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,202
Whoa!

510
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,691
Bye, Lisa.
Off to the TED Conference.

511
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,126
Three, two, one.

512
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,725
Think we should've
rented a bigger car?

513
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,408
Hey, wait for me!
I wanna help save the studio!

514
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,884
I wanna go with you!
Oh, not again.

515
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,163
Wow. I can't believe
we're all back together.

516
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,890
Even all you guys who
weren't in the montage!

517
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,243
Yeah, how come you didn't
use me in the montage?

518
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,402
I thought my story was
pretty interesting.

519
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,281
- Rowlf?
Wanna get back together?

520
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,566
- OK.
- Good.

521
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,683
Classic.

522
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,604
Anyhow, looks like
we got everybody,

523
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,922
so we can plan our telethon and
raise that ten million dollars.

524
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,809
- Well, not everybody.
- No, I think everybody's here.

525
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,200
- Where's...?
- All good!

526
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,646
- Miss...
- All done here!

527
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,245
- Piggy?

528
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,125
Kermit, we're going to
get Miss Piggy, right?

529
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,482
OK, OK, OK, you're right.
We'll go get Piggy!

530
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,487
My Minitel tells me she
is in Paris, France.

531
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,324
Oh! Well, then we
drive to France.

532
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,405
- You can't drive to France, Walter.
- Yeah. It's way too far.

533
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,324
Then maybe we should
travel by map!

534
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,721
- Good idea, Fozzie.
- Yeah!

535
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,931
To Paris!

536
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,003
Paris! Paris!

537
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,771
Look at these ceilings!

538
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,485
Yeah.
They must be very tall here.

539
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,371
Yeah, very nice.

540
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,605
Uh... Hi there. Excuse me.

541
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,887
Miss? Pardon me, ma'am?

542
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,771
Hi there! We're here to see
Miss Piggy, and it's urgent.

543
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,843
Urgent! Urgent!

544
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,889
- Is it urgent?
- Very. Yes.

545
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,523
Let's have a look then, shall we?
She has an opening in...

546
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,446
- ...early September.
- Early September?

547
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,170
That's like six months from now!

548
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,244
That's nothing.
Once I waited a whole year for September.

549
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,086
She is the plus-size editor.
She's a huge deal and extremely busy.

550
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,969
You can't just pop in
without an appointment.

551
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,407
- OK, then.
- Thank you.

552
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,210
- All right.
- Mean lady.

553
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,931
- Close the door on your way out.
- Thanks a lot.

554
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,962
- She wasn't very nice.
- Yeah.

555
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,125
Guys! Muppet Man!

556
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,602
- Yeah!
- That could work!

557
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,325
Hello.

558
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,086
I have an appointment.

559
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,888
Oh, OK.

560
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,445
<i>Um...</i>

561
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,965
Will you wait here a moment?

562
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,771
Decisions, decisions.

563
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,931
- Eeny, meeny, miny, mo.
I choose you.

564
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,561
- Mademoiselle Cochonnet?

565
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,491
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- Of course.

566
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,048
There's a...
man here to see you.

567
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,601
He does have an appointment.

568
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,842
An appointment? That's weird.

569
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,729
Well, why didn't you say so?
Send him in!

570
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,041
Right away. Sorry.

571
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,211
- Ahahaha.
- Remember, left foot, right foot.

572
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,361
Hello.

573
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,010
- Whoa.

574
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,964
- What the...?
- Sorry.

575
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,605
That looked expensive.

576
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,564
- You look familiar.
- So do you!

577
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,364
Please, have a seat.

578
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,171
Yes, we're going to
have a seat now.

579
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,085
- No, no, no, don't sit down!
- Oh, sorry! Whoa!

580
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,048
Uh-oh.

581
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,569
Message to head. Left leg in trouble!
Going down. Left leg going down!

582
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,687
What?

583
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,967
- Ohh!

584
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,327
I can't believe I
fell for Muppet Man.

585
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,847
- You guys OK?
- Is anyone hurt?

586
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,727
Kermit?

587
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,571
- Hello, Piggy.
- Kermie!

588
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,611
Oh, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie,
Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie!

589
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,081
Mm, mm, mm. Kissy-kissy.
Mm, mm, mm!

590
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,882
Wait! What am I doing?
I promised myself I'd never go back!

591
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,762
I am woman! I am strong!
You must leave at once!

592
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,606
- OK.
- No, no, wait, wait!

593
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,923
Miss Piggy!
The Muppet Studios are in danger.

594
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,005
In danger? Our studios? Kermit!

595
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,643
It's true, Piggy. And we need to
do The <i>Muppet</i> Show again.

596
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,847
We need you.

597
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,847
Oh.

598
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,011
Before I decide anything, I
need to talk with you, frog.

599
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,209
Alone.

600
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:13,086
Piggy? Last time we were together,
I said some things I regret.

601
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,608
No. No, Kermit.
You were just being honest.

602
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,967
You never intended to marry me.

603
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,963
Not even after I
built us a house

604
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,805
where we could raise tadpoles
and grow old together.

605
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,931
Well, who do you think's been looking
after that house all these years, huh?

606
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,323
Piggy, why do you have to always
be so overdramatic about things?

607
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,721
You know, it leaves me no choice
but to do things that hurt you.

608
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,248
I am who I am.
Why can't you accept that about me?

609
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,209
Look, this is not
about you and me.

610
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,930
It's never about
you and me, is it?

611
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,890
It's always we.
We this, we that.

612
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,364
"We" need you. You can't even
say, "I need you," can you?

613
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,249
Piggy...

614
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,204
I'm sorry, Kermit, but
I have a life here.

615
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,331
A life I've made for myself.

616
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,327
Piggy!

617
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,686
Just remember, Kermit,
I cannot be replaced.

618
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,606
Kermit? What happened?
Where's Miss Piggy?

619
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,081
- She's not coming, Fozzie.

620
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,766
But, Kermit, we always
worked together.

621
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,962
We can't do this
without Miss Piggy.

622
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,088
No one will give us
a show without her.

623
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,004
We'll be fine, Fozzie.

624
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,841
We'll be fine.

625
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,764
We just...

626
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,526
We'll just have to come
up with something else.

627
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,482
Kermie.

628
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,403
OK, I've got an idea.
We need a pig that can sing.

629
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,848
But, Kermit, who could
possibly replace Miss Piggy?

630
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,603
Hey, what's everybody
so quiet about, huh?

631
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,771
- Well, she's sorta like Miss Piggy
- Come on, everybody.

632
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,606
Let's go pitch our telethon and
get the Muppets back on TV, OK?

633
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,201
- No.
- No.

634
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,929
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, that's wonderful!

635
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,411
That means no.

636
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,927
- Come on, guys.
- Awkward.

637
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,731
Listen, Kermit, I like you.

638
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,723
I remember you guys
from when I was a kid.

639
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,724
- So I'm gonna shoot straight.

640
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,725
- You guys aren't
famous any more.

641
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,570
I wish she'd shot a
little more curvy.

642
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,929
Take a look at this diagram the
research department drew up.

643
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,766
This circle represents everything
that's currently popular.

644
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,606
And this tiny speck is you guys.

645
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,001
So the answer's no.
It's not gonna happen.

646
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,970
Take a look at the shows that are popular now.
<i>Punch</i> Teacher.

647
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,126
<i>- Oh! I love that show.
- It's time to punch teacher!</i>

648
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,928
<i>- Finish him!
- It's my favorite.</i>

649
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,765
<i>I just thought I could
make a difference.</i>

650
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,209
I'm sorry, but in this market, you guys
are no longer relevant. Have a good day.

651
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,369
Before I go, I'd just
like to say something.

652
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,729
I think kids are smarter and better
than all this junk, and if you...

653
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,729
Veronica, bad news.
<i>Punch</i> Teacher has stopped production.

654
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,644
It's being sued by the
Teachers Society of America.

655
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,930
- What's their problem?
- No idea. I just found out.

656
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,560
What are we supposed to do with
that 120-minute black hole

657
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,610
in the schedule coming
up in two days?

658
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,046
OK, Muppets.
You've got yourselves a show.

659
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,447
- All right!
- Oh, yes!

660
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,962
Thank you so much.
You will not be sorry, I promise, I promise!

661
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,170
OK, enough! One, no more going nuts in my office.
These are new carpets.

662
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,403
- Yes, ma'am.
- And two, you need a celebrity host.

663
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,769
OK. Whatever, whatever.
Come on, guys, let's go. Yeah!

664
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,046
- Let me wipe that.
- You've missed a spot.

665
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,850
- I don't see it.
- Just a little lower!

666
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,764
- Oh, I am so sorry. Did I get you...
- Yes.

667
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,130
Well, gentlemen.
It appears we have some competition

668
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,328
on the Muppet propel“IY-

669
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,723
The <i>Economist</i> says they've
gotten back together again.

670
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,850
- The Muppets got back together?
- Remember?

671
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,765
<i>♪ Together again Gee,
it's good to be... ♪</i>

672
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,720
Gentlemen, please!
No singing in my office!

673
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,370
- Yes, sir.
- But, of course, it was all his fault.

674
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,682
- Mostly his fault.
- No matter.

675
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,329
Point is, that studio and
that oil belong to me.

676
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,164
Yeah, those Muppets are gonna be

677
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,687
running home with their
tails between their legs.

678
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,003
Some of 'em literally.
Because those ones have tails.

679
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,960
Maniacal laugh, maniacal laugh.

680
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,849
That's a maniacal laugh moment.

681
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,005
OK, this is it.
80's Robot, let's park around back.

682
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,320
<i>It's The Muppet Show,</i>

Gary. Can you believe it?

688
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,963
- The Muppet theater.
- Yeah.

689
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,007
- Welcome back, everyone.
- Thanks.

690
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,680
Well, I know the old place is not
quite at its best right now.

691
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,491
Yeah!
Who cancelled the maid service?

692
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,847
But don't worry. We'll be fine.

693
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,886
Kermit, there's no way we can
rehearse with the place like this.

694
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,486
Wait.
Kermit, don't say another word.

695
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,486
Mary, Walter and I, well, we would be
happy to help you rebuild the theater.

696
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,250
Honestly, it would be an
honor for all three of us.

697
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,609
- So would.
- OK. Well, let's clean this place up!

698
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,285
Yeah!

699
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,843
- This is boring.
- But don't you guys remember?

700
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,368
You're the Muppets!
You do this to music!

701
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,965
Well, all right!

702
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,481
- Hey, Animal!
- Yeah?

703
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,721
Look what I found!

704
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,363
- Beauregard!
- Scooter! Good to see you!

705
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,727
Where's everybody been?

706
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,688
Celebrity... celebrity!

707
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,003
Hello! Yes. Could I speak with
President Carter, please?

708
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,602
He moved? Well, you don't happen to have
a number where I could reach... Hello?

709
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,489
Walter, I thought we were
gonna clean the balcony.

710
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,802
- Doing a great job, pal.
- You're doing a great job.

711
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,923
- Wocka wocka.
- Hey, guys!

712
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,401
Look at these old
photos I just found.

713
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,607
Oooh.

714
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,371
Can you believe that 80's
haircut I used to have?

715
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,727
I looked totally ridiculous!

716
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,202
Yes, it's Kermit. The frog.

717
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,601
Could you come to our celebrity
telethon this weekend?

718
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,410
Sure. Sure, I understand.

719
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,845
- Hey, shut the door!
- What is that?

720
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,487
Say hello to the little friend.

721
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,481
There goes dinner.

722
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,166
Wow! Great job, everybody!

723
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,761
Oh, hey, Kermit.
Listen, have a great night,

724
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,764
and I just want you to know, Walter
and I are really good sewers,

725
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,161
so we'll have those costumes
ready for you in no time.

726
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,130
- Good. You two have a great night.
- OK. Thank you!

727
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,601
- Bye.
- Kermit?

728
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,967
Gary, I was kind of hoping that
we could go to the beach tomorrow

729
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,407
- or see the Hollywood Sign.
- We'll have plenty of time

730
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,369
to do that stuff.
It's just, right now,

731
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,081
I don't wanna leave Walter.
You know, he needs me.

732
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,687
I don't know, sweetheart
he seems pretty happy.

733
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,566
- Like that.
- Oh, OK.

734
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,324
Now you.

735
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,887
Yeah, that's it!
Yeah, yeah, good job!

736
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,647
Well, just one more day, OK?
And then I'm all yours.

737
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,804
Tell you what. Why don't you get a
head start on sightseeing tomorrow

738
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,645
and then I'll be waiting
for you when you get back.

739
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,407
OK. Just...
don't forget about me.

740
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,800
Never.

741
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,689
Well, we're still on for
dinner Friday, right?

742
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,365
Yeah, of course.

743
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,885
- Oh, Walter!
- Oh, yes, Kermit.

744
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,923
Hey, listen, Walter, I
just wanna tell you

745
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,242
that none of this would have
happened without you, so thank you.

746
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,131
- Oh, well...
- And welcome aboard.

747
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,442
Night, everybody.
Just sleep anywhere you can find a spot.

748
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,331
"Welcome aboard"?

749
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,128
Hey, Kermit. You awake?

750
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,448
- Yep.
- What's the weather

751
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,810
- supposed to be like tonight?
- I don't know. Why?

752
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,009
I just don't want it to rain
through the hole in the ceiling.

753
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,889
Stars sure are pretty, though.

754
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,561
We're gonna be OK, right?
We haven't done this in a long time,

755
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,123
and I really don't
wanna go back to Reno.

756
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,123
Don't worry, Fozzie.
We'll be fine.

757
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,011
Look how we cleaned this
place up today, you know?

758
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,845
Same old team, all
pulling together.

759
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,085
I guess you're right.
Night-night, Kermit.

760
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,641
Good night, Fozzie.

761
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,370
OK, gather round, troops!
Everybody, time to get this rehearsal going.

762
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,648
- Scooter, is everybody here?
- Almost everyone, chief.

763
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,804
- Yeah...
- Hey, anybody got any kerosene?

764
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,049
I wanna take these old pig
dresses out back and burn 'em.

765
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,204
Hold it right there,
sausage snout!

766
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,005
- Piggy?
- Huh?

767
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,760
Well, look what the
cat dragged in.

768
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,684
Come on. Keep it up, Maurice.

769
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:24,244
Sorry, Miss Piggy, but you've
been replaced... permanently.

770
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,683
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

771
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,925
I don't think <i>so...</i> sister?

772
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,051
Who you calling sister, sister?

773
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,208
- Oh, look, an omelet station!
- Oh, where?

774
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,089
- Hiya!

775
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,689
There's only one Miss Piggy,
and she is <i>moi.</i>

776
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,687
Yeah, well, you ain't seen the last of me!
I'll be back!

777
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,723
Yeah, yeah. Heard of mouthwash?

778
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,287
- Welcome back, Miss Piggy.

779
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,966
All right, all right,
don't crowd me!

780
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,202
Wow, she sure hasn't changed.

781
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,163
Piggy? You came back.

782
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,961
I'm not here for you, Kermit.
I'm here for them.

783
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,127
And, besides, when
this show's done,

784
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,881
I'm catching the next plane
back to my life in Paris.

785
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,840
OK, Piggy, OK. Places for the
opening number, everybody!

786
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,529
Oh, good morning, Veronica.

787
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,129
- Morning, Frog.
- OK, everybody, take it from the top.

788
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,760
- Oooh!

789
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,962
- You missed your cue.
- I know!

790
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,442
There's kind of a rhythm
to this, you know?

791
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,201
Uh... Oh, and if you like that one,
what's the bear capital of the world?

We need drums!

You think you might
wanna help us out here?

Excuse me, miss, are you
expecting anyone else?

843
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,240
Oh... no.

844
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,721
No, it's just me. Party of one

845
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,649
Order up!

846
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,363
- OK, cue 17 is Fozzie's intro.
- Hey, Scooter? What's left?

847
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,727
Oh, uh, it's you, chief!

848
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,441
- Hm?
- Your duet.With Piggy.

849
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,325
- Miss Piggy?
- Hm?

850
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,363
We're all out front
practicing our acts

851
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,040
and seems that everybody expects
you and I to do a duet, so...

852
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,886
Oh, that's so lovely,
but I'm afraid I can't.

853
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,602
No, no, you see, I'm already doing
a duet with my new dance partner.

854
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,564
Hola.

855
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,563
OK, come on, rehearsing, let's go.
We gotta break it up.

856
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,041
- Excuse us.
- 'Scuse us.

857
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,964
Let's try that lift
again, shall we?

858
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,691
The lift again.
OK, on my count this time, OK?

859
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,565
- In three, two... Wait for me!

860
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,801
Good grief.

861
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,645
Kermit! There you are.
I've been looking for you everywhere!

862
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,205
So nice to see you, Veronica.

863
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,283
Who's hosting?
Did you find a celebrity?

864
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,331
Yeah, well, I've wanted to talk to
you about that, you see, because...

865
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,684
Well, actually, I'm
kind of a celebrity.

866
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,171
You?

867
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,129
No. Kermit, listen.

868
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,046
I will not air the show unless
you find a real celebrity host.

869
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,129
I will rerun <i>Benson</i>
if I have to.

870
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,210
Yeah, you see, the
thing is, Veronica,

871
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,204
that's kind of impossible
because the show's in 12 hours!

872
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,850
Twelve hours!

873
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:20,329
I might as well just go and ask Tex
Richman to give us the studio back!

874
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,290
And the Muppets are like a big family.
Well... And for us,

875
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,844
that theater <i>is...</i> is like our home.
Which is why, in conclusion...

876
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,002
<i>...we</i> humbly ask that
you give us back our studio.

877
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,329
It would certainly
mean a lot to us.

878
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,363
Hmmm.

879
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,244
Well, Mr. The Frog, let me see.

880
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,006
Correct!

881
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,441
The answer is no.

882
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,490
Well, you could've
just said that.

883
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,529
- Contract.
- Contract.

884
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,727
Contract.

885
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,171
- Nicely done, sir.
- You see, Muppets,

886
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,243
according to this contract,

887
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,200
it's not just this studio you
lose the rights to tonight,

888
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,362
- it's the Muppet name itself.
- What?

889
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,127
And all characters
under the Muppet name.

890
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,363
Wait a second. What possible use
could you have for our names?

891
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,161
Told ya I'd be back.

892
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,408
Well, now I am...

893
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,206
...back.

894
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:22,207
And I see you've met Mr. Richman
our new business partner.

895
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:28,561
The Moopets are a hard, cynical
act for a hard, cynical world.

896
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:35,001
Hey, Fozzie!
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

897
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,161
- Wocka wocka.
- You're relics, Muppets!

898
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,608
The world has moved on,
and no one cares about

899
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,721
your goody-goody, hippy-dippy, Julie
Andrews and Dom DeLuise hostin',

900
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,521
singin'-and-dancin' act any more!
You're dead!

901
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,923
- And I just come to bury you.

902
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:01,401
Now, get out of my office.

903
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,085
- What?
- What is that supposed to mean?

904
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,651
You said you were gonna
talk to the man!

905
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:09,089
Guys! OK, so maybe Kermit
signed away the theater

906
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,961
and the Muppet name, but as long
as we have a celebrity host,

907
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,920
we can still pull off a heart-warming,
last-minute triumph, right, Kermit?

908
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,806
Well, actually I don't
see how we can, Fozzie.

909
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,166
- Huh?
- What?

910
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,970
Guys, the show's in six hours,

911
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:29,762
and we're barely rehearsed,
and, well, <i>I...</i>

912
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,763
I couldn't get us
a celebrity host.

913
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,002
- Oh, no!
- What?

914
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:39,607
I'm afraid Tex Richman's right.
The world's moved on.

915
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,728
I'm sorry I dragged you
guys into this mess.

916
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,763
Kermit?

917
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,084
All right, listen
up, you freaks!

918
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,846
I didn't come 5,000
miles to not be on TV.

919
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,642
All we need is one stinkin' celebrity,
and by any means necessary.

920
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,840
Now, the frog's gone.
We're doing things my way from now on.

921
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,490
Let's move!

922
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,247
- Hey!
- Hi.

923
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,444
- How was your day?
- Oh, it was great.

924
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,763
I went to Guinness Book of
World Records... alone.

925
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,287
Then Ripley's Believe It or Not...
solo.

926
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,886
And then I ate lunch
unaccompanied,

927
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,243
and then I walked back here...
independently.

928
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,165
Listen, I got you these.

929
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,563
You know, to make up for the other ones.
The broken ones.

930
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,324
Thanks, sweetie.

931
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,445
Listen, Gary.

932
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,809
I was just wondering what the
plan was for dinner tonight.

933
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,405
Oh, I don't care.
What do you feel like?

934
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,291
OK. That's fine.

935
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,689
That's just fine. That's...
that's perfect.

936
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,248
I'm going to go for a walk.

937
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,761
- Individually.

938
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,364
- Walter, hey.
- Gary.

939
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,649
Oh, where have you been?
I need you to help me figure out a talent.

940
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,325
A talent for what?

941
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:17,485
For the show. Kermit asked
me to do an act in the show.

942
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,371
<i>I...</i> I could be a Muppet.

943
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,364
Wow.
Wow, Walter, that's amazing.

944
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,285
Yeah, but I need to figure
out if I have a talent.

945
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,761
Well, you know what?
I'm sure you'll think of something,

946
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,446
but right now I actually...
I need your help.

947
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,683
I'm starting to get the feeling that
Mary's upset with me about something,

948
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,287
and I don't know what, and I was hoping
maybe you would talk to her for me.

949
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,566
Gary, I'd love to help you out,

950
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,769
but I can't leave the theater now.
This is important.

951
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,969
Well, hold on a second.
I mean, my life is important, too

952
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,447
Yeah, but the whole reason we
came here was to see the Muppets.

953
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,967
No, it wasn't!
The whole reason we came here

954
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,441
was to take a vacation where I
took Mary out to a fancy dinner

955
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,284
because it's our tenth
anniversary, and then...

956
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,321
- Walter, what day is today?
- Friday.

957
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,404
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

958
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:08,121
This is bad. Walter, this is really bad.
I have to...

959
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,011
- Mary? Mary!
- Wait.

960
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,369
Gary, I need you.

961
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,209
OK, is everybody ready?

962
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,682
Commence Operation Celebri-nap.
Masks on!

963
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,081
- Masks on!
- Except for <i>moi.</i>

964
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,765
Nothing covers this
beautiful face.

965
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,329
No maskin'? - No maskin'.

966
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,923
Check the door on Stage 28.

967
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,526
<i>- I'm going over there now.
- She's done in makeup...</i>

968
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,363
I told you, I'm not done
putting on my balls!

969
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,285
Oh, hey, Animal.

970
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,607
What are you doin' here?

971
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,890
Acting. Natural.

972
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,241
Now!

973
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,487
Whoa!

974
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,404
- Hiya!

975
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,006
Hiya!

976
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,086
Mary, surprise!
I figured out why you're mad... at me.

977
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,849
<i>Gary, I've gone home.</i>

978
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,601

Mr. Jack Black has graciously
agreed to do the telethon!

1018
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,566
Oh, my gosh, that's amazing.
Where is he?

1019
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,644
- In the trunk.
- Get me outta here!

1020
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,724
You kidnapped Jack Black?
That's illegal!

1021
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:18,442
But, Kermit, what's more illegal,
briefly inconveniencing Jack Black,

1022
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:23,128
- or destroying the Muppets?
- Kidnapping Jack Black, Fozzie!

1023
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,568
Kermit, listen.
Whatever I may think of you right now,

1024
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,405
these guys are counting on you.
You inspire them.

1025
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,291
- What, to kidnap people?
- To work together.

1026
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,286
- To kidnap people?
- Mr. The Frog, we all agreed

1027
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,125
a celebrity is not a people.

1028
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,648
And now that we have a
celebrity, the show's back on.

1029
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,407
Come on, Kermit.
Don't let these guys down now.

1030
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,131
All right. Well, what are you
guys still doing here, huh?

1031
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,731
- It's showtime!
- All right!

1032
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,927
That's it!

1033
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,201
- Nicely done, sir. As usual.
- En garde.

1034
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,569
Ow! Ow.

1035
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,961
OK, very nice.

1036
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,282
Halt! Point left!

1037
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,250
Well done, sir. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

Hang on, everyone!

1046
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,885
Come on, guys. OK, listen up, everybody!
This is it! Five minutes to curtain!

1047
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,042
- Kermit?
- Get ready for the opening number.

1048
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,884
- Yes?
- I need to talk to you about my act.

1049
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,883
Listen, Walter, I know
you're gonna be fine.

1050
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,122
In fact, I'm sure you'll be great.
Scooter, who's up first?

1051
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,645
- Come on, come on, come on!
- No...

1052
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,165
Fly in the arches!

1053
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,406
- OK, first we have the opening theme.
- Of course. Yeah.

1054
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,369
- You come out and introduce Fozzie.
- Right.

1055
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,205
Then we have...
TV executive at six o'clock!

1056
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,210
- What?
- The show is a disaster, Frog!

1057
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,442
- Veronica...
- Where's the audience?

1058
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,046
I knew you guys weren't
popular any more.

1059
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:28,210
I should have trusted that chart.
There's no one here!

1060
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,010
- What about Hobo Joe?
- Who?

1061
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,640
Why does everybody
forget about Hobo Joe?

1062
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,564
- Just a second. Scooter!
- Yeah, chief?

1063
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,441
- Did you hand out all those flyers?
- Of course. Every last one!

1064
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,001
Don't worry.
We'll think of something!

1065
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,491
- You better

1066
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,682
Yoo-hoo! You've got audience.

1067
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,650
It's me! What am I, invisible?

1068
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,007
- Jack Black.

1069
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,924
Fifteen seconds to
curtain, Mr. Black

1070
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,081
- Hi!
- Ah! Where am I?

1071
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,369
Why am I so fancy? What are you doing?
You're ruining my look!

1072
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,921
- We'll see you out there! Good luck!
- Stop cleaning me!

1073
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:05,085
- You sure got nice teeth, Jack Black.
- Yeah.

01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,521
- something about saving a theater.
- Yes, yes, of course.

1152
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,286
I don't really know who you guys are
My agent just told me to show up.

1153
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,720
- That's great.
- Are you one of the

1154
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,086
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?

1155
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,005
Yes, I am, and let me show
you how you can help.

1156
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,642
And don't worry.
It's just your one shot to go on live TV

1157
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,928
before millions of people to
prove you have what it takes

1158
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,805
to become one of the Muppets.
Good luck.

1159
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,211
Up next, folks, I am proud
to present a brand-new act

1160
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,170
to the show. Introducing Walter.

1161
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,891
That's not good.

1162
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:27,127
It appears that Walter has
stepped out, so it's...

1163
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,330
Well, it's back to the days of
yore down at the old barbershop.

1164
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,449
Oh, no! It's a barbershop quartet!
Get me out of here!

1165
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,763
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

1166
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,161
Is that Nirvana? Stop it! No!

1167
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,727
You're ruining one of the
greatest songs of all time!

1168
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,811
Ow!

1169
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,370
Careful around the ears!

1170
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,531
Ah! That was hot!

1171
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,843
Hey! What's going on here?
Why is my body so big?

1172
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,606
<i>What'd you do to my voice?
I sound like a chipmunk!</i>

1173
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,882
Wait a second.
Did you guys shrink my head?

1174
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,884
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jack Black!

1175
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,763
Nice work, everybody.
Chickens, you're up next!

1176
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,287
It's going rather nicely.
We might just make this

1177
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,202
And now I am pleased
and proud to present

1178
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,643
those princesses of poultry,
Camilla and friends!

1179
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,486
Let's hear it for Camilla
and her farmyard friends!

1180
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,964
No, I... I don't know why
I'm not hosting this.

1181
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,691
So remember, folks, keep on calling
and you'll help us reach our goal

1182
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,451
of ten million dollars by midnight.
And if...

1183
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,487
Oh, dear.

1184
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,846
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't be alarmed.

1185
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,810
We will get this sorted out just
as soon as we can. Scooter!

1186
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:14,130
Well, that's that.
Nice try, Muppets!

1187
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,044
Kermit, how are we going to
raise the rest of the money

1188
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,366
with no electricity?

1189
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,761
All right, calm down, everybody.

1190
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,365
- Is everybody OK?
- Yeah.

1191
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,091
Well, we can't do the
show without power.

1192
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,164
- Anybody got any bright ideas?
- Not now, Fozzie.

1193
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,687
Ten-gauge gator grip.

1194
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,687
I love it when you talk shop.

1195
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,004
Oh!

1196
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,969
<i>♪ La la la la la la
la ♪ Mee mee mee mee</i>

1197
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,651
What?
How'd they get the power back?

1198
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,883
We're gonna have to
get up on that roof

1199
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:09,487
and shut 'em down for good!
Bolt cutters!

1200
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,847
Bolt cutters.

1201
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,247
Deadly! You come with me.

1202
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,251
That's it.

1203
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,765
Hm.

1204
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,041
To the end of the Muppets!

1205
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,202
Deadly! What are you doing?

1206
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,964
Enough!

1207
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:40,648
Just because I have a terrifying
name and an evil English accent,

1208
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,849
does not preclude the
fact that, in my heart,

1209
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,881
I am a Muppet, not a Moopet!

1210
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,806
Looks like it's I who
will have the last laugh!

1211
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,487
- What does that mean?
- It's an idiom, you idiot,

1212
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,486
because you cannot laugh! Ha ha!

1213
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,165
- Oopsie.

1214
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,166
Deadly.

1215
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,404
Now that's a maniacal
laugh for you!

1216
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:12,564
Hey, Gary, Mary, how'd you
guys get here so fast?

1217
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,802
We travelled by map.
We thought it'd be quicker.

1218
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,009
Hey, I'm sorry I bailed.
I just...

1219
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,242
I realized you don't let
the most important person

1220
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,727
in your world slip away.

1221
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,969
- Hey, Scooter?
- Yeah?

1222
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,481
Could you do me a favor and
take over hosting duty?

1223
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,450
But, chief, I don't go onstage.

1224
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,161
Well, just do what I do.
Pretend that the audience is naked.

1225
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,890
<i>Yeah, but, I...</i>

1226
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,929
<i>Ha...</i> ha... ha...

1227
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,486
Uh, Miss Piggy?

1228
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,322
- You are all naked.

1229
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,891
Well, sorta.

1230
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:13,567
OK. Great!
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1231
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,803
please welcome, a real hero...

1232
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,931
You saved it?
After all this time?

1233
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,084
Oh, Kermie.

1234
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,806
I guess I'm not that good at
saying this kind of stuff.

1235
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,122
- Yes, Kermie?
- Well...

1236
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,770
...over the last week,
I realized that...

1237
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,526
I miss you.

1238
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:00,882
And I need you.

1239
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:07,644
And maybe you don't need the,
the whole world to love you.

1240
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,962
Maybe you just need one person.

1241
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,291
It's time for our song, and if we
don't raise the money tonight,

1242
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,841
it might be the last
time we sing together.

1243
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:26,643
And... Well, are you ready?

1244
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,529
Oh, Kermie.

01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,601
- For you, Kermie?
- Yeah.

1279
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,921
Of course!

1280
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,601
Woo hoo!

1281
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,210
Thank you, everybody.

1282
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,806
Thank you, all.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1283
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,249
it's almost midnight and we haven't
quite reached our target yet,

1284
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:33,928
but if you'll all just stick around,
we'll be right back with our final act.

1285
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:38,005
The Muppet Telethon <i>will</i>
return after these messages.

1286
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:44,721
Walter?
Walter, where are you, buddy?

1287
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,521
Listen, everybody, the show ran short,
and we don't have anything else planned.

1288
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,564
We need one last act
to bring us home.

1289
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,530
I'm gonna go check on Jack Black
and see if he has any ideas.

1290
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,011
You guys see if you can
come up with something.

1291
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,208
We have two minutes!
Two minutes!

1292
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,722
- Think, think, think!
- What am I thinking?

1293
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:05,202
Walter. Walt!

1294
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:07,929
- Walter!
- Gary?

1295
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:11,522
- Wha... You came back.
- Walter.

1296
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,409
What are you doing down here?

1297
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,201
They just need one more act.
You gotta get out there and help those guys.

1298
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,809
I can't. What if people laugh at me?
<i>I...</i>

1299
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:26,522
I'd rather go back home to Smalltown.
With you.

1300
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,810
Look, Walter, you're my brother,

1301
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:37,569
and I'm always gonna love you, but
you belong here, with these guys.

1302
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,849
Hey, you're the one who
got Kermit to do this.

1303
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,571
You're the one who brought
everyone here together.

1304
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:48,362
You always believe in other
people, but that's easy.

1305
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:51,888
Sooner or later, you gotta
believe in yourself, too,

1306
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:55,050
because that's what
growing up is.

1307
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,964
It's becoming who
you want to be.

1308
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,841
You have to try. Please, Walter.

1309
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,446
You're my hero.

1310
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:22,084
OK, Jack Black's got nothing.
What did you guys come up with?

1311
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:25,648
- Bunsen can set Beaker on fire.
- No, no, no, we can't do that.

1312
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,565
- I could break out the fart shoes.
- No, no, no, that will never work!

1313
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:29,881
<i>We're back in three, two...</i>

1314
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,171
Oh, no!

1315
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,050
It's Walter.

1316
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,724
Thank you.

1317
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,124

- Oh, that was wonderful!

1318
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,921
Ladies and gentlemen, Walter!

1319
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,686
It looks like we're going
to get our studio back!

1320
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:11,930
the Muppets are about to
take back their studio.

1321
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:21,285
Help! I've been mugged.
Alerting authorities.

1322
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,847
<i>We're sorry...
- What happened? Hello?</i>

1323
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,685
- Hello?
- Guys, my phone is dead.

1324
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:32,370
My phone is also dead.
Repeat, my phone is also dead.

1325
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,730
Ooh...

1326
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:51,601
I did it. I beat you.

1327
01:28:54,840 --> 01:29:00,006
Game over, Kermit. You lost.

1328
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,847
Chicky!

1329
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,244
Too late, Muppets. I won!
Turn that thing off!

1330
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,887
- The show is over!

1331
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,804
But we were so close!

1332
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,527
Or not.

1333
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,808
It kinda makes me feel
better, honestly.

1334
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,606
I mean, we were
nowhere close at all.

1335
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,845
You artists formerly
known as the Muppets

1336
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,810
are standing on
private property.

1337
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,850
My private property

1338
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,810
And I'm telling you to leave.
Now!

1339
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,765
He's right, everybody.

1340
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,481
He won. We gotta go.

1341
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:07,730
Not now, Fozzie.

1342
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,646
- I can't believe this.
- I know.

1343
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:21,322
Well, that's that.

1344
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,487
This isn't right.

1345
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,529
It can't end like this.

1346
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,523
But what can we do?

1347
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:52,169
Listen, everybody, we've got nothing
to be ashamed of. And you know why?

1348
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:58,371
Well, because thanks to
Walter here, we tried.

1349
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,807
And if we failed,
we failed together,

1350
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:06,285
and to me, that's
not failing at all.

1351
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,245
And I don't care what
anybody <i>says.</i>

1352
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:15,686
And I don't care if no one
believes in us, because I believe.

1353
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,889
- I believe in you.
- Huh?

1354
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,168
- And you.
- Me?

1355
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:25,211
- And you.

1356
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,284
You know, what's important
isn't this building or a name.

1357
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:31,171
It's each other. So I say, fine,

1358
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,926
let's just start at the bottom and
work our way back up to the top.

1359
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,084
Yeah.
- Let's all walk out through these doors

1360
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:42,690
with our heads held high.
As a family.

1361
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:46,731
- Because that's what we are.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1362
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,891

1363
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,290
