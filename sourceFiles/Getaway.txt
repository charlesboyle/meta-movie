2
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,355
<i>Snowing and blowing up
bushels of fun</i>

3
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,028
Leanne?

4
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,063
<i>Now the jingle hop has--</i>

5
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,944
<i>Jingle bell, Jingle bell Jingle bell rock</i>

6
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,830
<i>Jingle bells chime in  jingle bell time</i>

7
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:16,627
<i>Dancing and prancing
in Jingle Bell Square</i>

8
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,130
<i>In the frosty air</i>

9
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:24,135
<i>What a bright time
It's the right time</i>

10
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:28,844
<i>To rock the night away</i>

11
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:32,977
<i>Jingle bell time is a swell time</i>

12
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,270
<i>To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh</i>

13
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:48,238
<i>Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet</i>

14
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,783
<i>That's the jingle bell rock</i>

15
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,883
Oh, my God!

16
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,535
Listen carefully.

17
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,044
Your wife has been taken.

18
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:33,139
At 4:30 p.m., you will go
to the Vatashca Street parking garage.

19
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,813
There, on Level 2
you will find a very special car.

20
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,439
<i>You will know which one.</i>

21
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,860
- Steal it.
- Unh!

22
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:55,783
<i>There are cameras installed
on the inside and outside of this vehicle.</i>

23
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,946
<i>I'm watching every move you make.</i>

24
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,796
Drive it to the top of the city
and I will contact you there.

25
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,761
<i>It's been a long time
since you've driven...</i>

26
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,094
<i>...but you'll have to overcome your fear
if you want to save her.</i>

27
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,937
Your wife is very beautiful.

28
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,769
If you want her back, then you will
follow my instructions precisely.

29
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,282
If you contact the police,
or if you get caught...

30
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,202
...she will die.

31
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,822
<i>You've done very well so far, Mr. Magna.</i>

32
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:28,081
<i>During the course of this night,
you will be given several tasks.</i>

33
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,037
<i>If you fail at any...</i>

34
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,669
<i>you will never see your wife again.</i>

35
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,042
<i>How do you like the car?</i>

36
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,131
<i>Do you like it?</i>

37
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,133
<i>It's armored.</i>

38
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,636
<i>It was designed especially for you.</i>

39
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,303
Is she alive?

40
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,347
<i>The police will be looking for you.</i>

41
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,057
<i>If they catch you, ever...</i>

42
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,356
<i>...the game's over.
Is that clear?</i>

43
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,234
<i>Brent? Why is this happening?</i>

44
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,363
<i>Please, help me.
I'm so scared.</i>

45
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,741
<i>Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me? Wait!</i>

46
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,326
<i>She's fine.</i>

47
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,486
<i>For now.</i>

48
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,533
<i>She will remain that way
as long as you follow my instructions.</i>

49
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,327
<i>I'm watching you, always.</i>

50
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,245
<i>Get rid of your phone.</i>

51
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,543
What do you want?

52
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,258
What do you want?

53
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,139
Where are we?

54
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,978
No! Please, please, don't leave me here!

55
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,270
No!

56
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,809
<i>- Answer.
- Speed up.</i>

57
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,273
<i>Faster.</i>

58
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,946
<i>Turn left.</i>

59
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,458
<i>Go through the intersection
and turn hard left.</i>

60
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,541
No, I can't do that.
I'll dead end into the park.

61
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,455
<i>- Just do it.
- It's Christmas.</i>

62
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,752
<i>- There's gotta be hundreds of people in there.
- I won't ask again.</i>

63
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,461
Shit.

64
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,347
Come on! Get out of my way.

65
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,353
<i>Drive toward the market.</i>

66
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,816
<i>Smash into everything you can.</i>

67
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,698
<i>- I can't do this!
- You have no choice.</i>

68
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,576
Jesus.

69
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,962
<i>Excellent.
Now drive onto the skating rink.</i>

70
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,173
<i>- There's too many people!
- Now.</i>

71
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,505
Get out of the way!

72
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,526
<i>Go straight to the stage
where the man is speaking. Knock it down.</i>

73
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,860
- I'll kill him.
- Do it.

74
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,025
- Are you crazy?
- Now.

75
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,714
<i>Now go down the stairs.</i>

76
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,884
Ah, shit.

77
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,259
Ah...

78
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,182
<i>Mr. Magma, are you there?</i>

79
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,392
<i>Confirm you're still receiving.</i>

80
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,236
<i>I can hear you.
Where's my wife?</i>

81
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,607
<i>Keep going. Now.</i>

82
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,322
Watch out, watch out!

83
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,660
Oh, no, no!

84
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,574
Jesus.

85
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,683
Bravo, Mr. Magna.
Your first task is complete.

86
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,313
Am I done?

87
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,566
We're just getting started, my boy.

88
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,270
<i>We're just getting started.</i>

89
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,779
<i>Turn right, now.</i>

90
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,868
<i>- The water truck.
- Yeah?</i>

91
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,152
<i>Smash into it!</i>

92
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,211
<i>Don't stop.</i>

93
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,166
<i>speed up.</i>

94
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,502
- Faster.
- The light's red down there.

95
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,966
<i>Go through it.</i>

96
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,309
Jesus.

97
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,069
<i>Wonderful, Mr. Brent Magna.</i>

98
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,983
<i>Now turn right. Pull into the
underground construction zone.</i>

99
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,706
<i>Relax...</i>

100
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,495
<i>...and you will await
further instructions.</i>

101
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,539
Get out.

102
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,124
- Get out, now!
- All right.

103
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,005
<i>Do not get out of the car.</i>

104
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,587
You heard me asshole, get out.

105
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,262
Now.

106
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,094
- Look, you got the wrong car. Walk away--
- Now!

107
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,724
- I'm doing you a favor.
- Get out.

108
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,760
- You don't wanna-- Walk away.
- Get out.

109
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,225
- You don't wanna steal--
- Get out of the car!

110
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,558
<i>- Drive away.
- I can't! I got a kid in the car!</i>

111
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,567
<i>- Get out! What?
- Drive away now!</i>

112
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,854
- Drive.
- What do you want me to do with her?

113
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,569
<i>Drive away! Take her with you!
Do it. Drive!</i>

114
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,483
All right, all right, all right!

115
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,402
Get off of me, asshole!

116
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,744
Do not ever point a gun at me, you hear me?
Do not ever point a gun at anyone!

117
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,582
Unh! Don't ever touch me like that again.
Do you know what I could have done to you?

118
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,748
- The hell are you doing?
- Strap yourself in.

119
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,837
- I'm not doing shit!
- Put on your seatbelt.

120
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,842
- No!
- Strap yourself in.

121
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,424
- Where are you going?
- Just strap yourself in!

122
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,597
<i>Kill her.</i>

123
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,765
<i>She has seen you
and she has seen the vehicle.</i>

124
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,104
<i>- Kill her.
- I'm not gonna do it. I can't do that.</i>

125
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,518
<i>You either shoot her...</i>

126
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,779
<i>...or I'm going to shoot your wife.</i>

127
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,315
<i>One.</i>

128
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,613
<i>Two.</i>

129
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,028
What? What? No.

130
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,869
I can't do that!

131
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,704
I'm not a killer.

132
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,996
<i>It's the right choice.
You'll need her.</i>

133
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,500
You can keep the car.
Can I get out now?

134
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,136
<i>- I'll let you off right up here.
- She is not to be set free.</i>

135
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,139
<i>- I-- Listen.
- She is not to be set free.</i>

136
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,471
<i>- Understood?
- It's understood.</i>

137
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,143
Oh, great.

138
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,233
Oh, my God.

139
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,686
What did you do?

140
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,237
Pull over!

141
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,400
Oh! Shit!

142
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,241
Oh, God.

143
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,326
- What the hell are you doing?
- Put on your seatbelt!

144
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,751
Shit. Hey, hey!
Do not touch that gun, all right?

145
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,840
- I need both hands to drive this car!
- Let go of me, asshole!

146
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,004
Do not touch that gun!

147
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,926
I don't care. I hope we crash.
Help me! This guy's trying to kill me!

148
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,934
- What are you doing?
- Pull us over!

149
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,221
Get in! Get inside the car!

150
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,687
- This guy's crazy! Help me!
- Get inside this car, all right?

151
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,523
You understand me? Stay in the car!

152
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,200
Pull over.

153
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,210
Please slow down.

154
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,418
- Oh, we're gonna die.
- Shut up.

155
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,382
Oh, my God.

156
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,389
Shit.

157
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,383
No, no, no.

158
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,898
You're the shittiest
driver I've ever seen.

159
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,607
Back off, back off. Jesus!

160
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,581
Oh, shit!

161
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,258
Is he dead?

162
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,595
I hope not.

163
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,984
Listen to me, all right.

164
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:26,523
I have got to get this car out of the city
right now, or they're gonna murder my wife.

165
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,617
- You understand me?
- Sure.

166
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,777
Let me give you a word to the wise.

167
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,824
Next time you wanna steal a car,
try to make sure that no one is in it.

168
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,460
- It works better.
- I'm not stealing it, you asshole. This is my car.

169
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,000
- What?
- You probably don't understand this...

170
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,506
...because you're a criminal.

171
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,214
Things in this world belong to people
before people like you take them.

172
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,128
This car, which was really great...

173
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,969
...till you added all these cameras
to drain the battery...

174
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,725
...belongs to me.
- How'd you find the car?

175
00:18:55,051 --> 00:19:00,023
I got a call from a cop saying he saw my car
parked in the garage where I found you.

176
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,808
What makes you think it was a cop?

177
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,567
Because he said so, genius.

178
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,229
What kind of cop calls
to tell you he's got your car...

179
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,489
...but he still leaves me inside of it?

180
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,992
- It wasn't the police that called.
- Then who was it?

181
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,367
I don't know.

182
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,654
- When was it stolen?
- Whenever you stole it.

183
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,666
When was the last time you saw it?

184
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,749
Two days ago, I guess.
Look, you're obviously very disturbed.

185
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,914
Whatever trouble you're in,
you deserve it.

186
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,925
So I'll cut you a deal.
Pull over and I'll let you walk away.

187
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,837
- Or what, you shoot me?
- Give me back my gun and I will.

188
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,676
What's a kid doing with a gun, huh?

189
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,762
So if some dipshit like you steps to me,
I can take care of it.

190
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,428
That worked out well for you, didn't it?

191
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,689
Did you recognize the voice,
huh, that voice?

192
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,851
- Your friend who wanted you to kill me?
- He's not my friend, okay?

193
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,566
I'm not the kind of person
you wanna be caught kidnapping.

194
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,901
Yeah? You special, is that it?

195
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,035
Just do me one favor, will you?
Shut the hell up.

196
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,945
You shut up!

197
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,365
What are you doing? Hey.

198
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,034
What the hell?

199
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:07,674
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way</i>

200
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:12,588
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

201
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:18,635
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way</i>

202
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:24,183
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

203
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,316
<i>Dashing through the snow</i>

204
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,775
<i>In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

205
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,190
<i>O'er the hills we go</i>

206
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,825
<i>Laughing all the way</i>

207
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,576
I can't believe
you threw my phone out the window.

208
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:48,123
- I have a lot of money, you know.
- Good for you.

209
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,338
As in, if you let me go,
I can give you a lot of money.

210
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,754
- I don't want your money.
- What do you want?

211
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,922
I want you to stop talking.

212
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,926
And I want my wife back.

213
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,479
- And he took her?
- He did.

214
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,355
Whatever you owe him, I can get however
much it is to pay him off, no problem.

215
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,110
We'll take care of it right now.

216
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,442
You have to let me go
and stop almost killing us.

217
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:17,111
I would love to let you out of this car.
Unfortunately, I can't do that.

218
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,573
Why the hell not?

219
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:22,536
Because he asked me not to
and I am doing whatever he asks.

220
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,869
So, what? What are you supposed to do?

221
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,460
- I don't know.
- Well, who is he?

222
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,883
- I don't know.
- What do you know?

223
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,047
Not much.

224
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,521
No, no, no!

225
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,153
Get up!

226
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,987
- Shut up.
- Ow! Aah!

227
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:00,991
Please. Please. Please, don't shoot me.
Please, don't shoot me.

228
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,405
Quiet.

229
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:11,206
<i>- Answer.
- It's time for your next task.</i>

230
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,342
<i>- What is it?
- More police are coming.</i>

231
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,923
<i>You'll have four minutes to get away.</i>

232
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,339
<i>You'll follow my instructions exactly.</i>

233
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,683
<i>- Someone wants to say hello.
- Please, please.</i>

234
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,515
<i>- Leanne?
- Please. Help.</i>

235
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,021
<i>The clock starts now.</i>

236
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,942
Damn it!

237
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,444
I'm totally screwed.

238
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,532
Oh!

239
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,700
- Ram him.
- What are you doing?

240
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,420
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Keep going.</i>

241
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,920
You're an idiot.
That's assault with a deadly weapon.

242
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,929
They could shoot at us now.

243
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,426
<i>- Speed up.
- Shit.</i>

244
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,388
<i>Turn right now.</i>

245
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,062
<i>Remember, if they catch you...</i>

246
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,439
<i>you'll be a widower.</i>

247
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,821
<i>- Turn left.
- Oh, shit.</i>

248
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,165
<i>- Force him off the road.
- Look out!</i>

249
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,590
- This is not very subtle!
- What are you talking about?

250
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,093
You're not making yourself
very hard to find.

251
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,640
God, I promise I'll be good from now on.
Please let me live.

252
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,100
<i>- You're really not helping, okay?
- Turn right.</i>

253
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,198
Great.

254
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,460
<i>Turn right down the alley.</i>

255
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,580
Stop!

256
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,801
Holy shit.

257
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,225
- Two minutes.
- We're gonna die, please stop!

258
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,980
<i>I don't think you'll make it.</i>

259
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,909
- What are you doing?
- Take a deep breath, okay? And calm down.

260
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,003
Shit.

261
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,500
<i>I wouldn't relax just yet.</i>

262
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,389
- Shit.
- Not again.

263
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,767
<i>- Did you think we were done?
- No, don't!</i>

264
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,302
God!

265
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,187
<i>You're running out of time.</i>

266
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,111
Oh! Oh!

267
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,616
<i>Tick tock, tick tock.</i>

268
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,709
<i>You have less than a minute.</i>

269
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,212
<i>- Turn into the park.
- No, not the park!</i>

270
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,088
Here we go.

271
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,381
<i>Your wife's time is running out.</i>

272
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,972
- Watch out!
- Unh!

273
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,759
<i>- Go through the intersection.
- All right, hold on!</i>

274
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,271
<i>Not much time, Mr. Magna.</i>

275
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,314
Oh, no!

276
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,112
- No, please don't! Don't!
- Yep, yep, yep, hold on!

277
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,746
<i>Five...</i>

278
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,782
- ...four...
- Come on, come on, come on!

279
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,416
<i>...three...</i>

280
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,293
<i>- ...two...
- Oh!</i>

281
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,829
<i>...one...</i>

282
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:23,590
...zero. Bravo, Mr. Magna.
Well done.

283
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,927
Bravo. Your wife lives...

284
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,178
<i>...for now.</i>

285
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,265
Well done.

286
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:53,870
Answer.

287
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:58,034
“Brent Magna is
both reckless and fearful.

288
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,747
He is, in short...

289
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:04,290
...a dangerous driver
and should pursue another profession."

290
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,801
Remember that review?
It wasn't very flattering.

291
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,383
<i>They're blind to your real talents...</i>

292
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,516
<i>...which are perfectly
suited to my needs.</i>

293
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:14,891
Do I know you?

294
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,018
<i>I know you, Mr. Magna...</i>

295
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,975
<i>- ...and I believe in you.
- Listen.</i>

296
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,267
I need to know when this is all
gonna be over, all right? I need--

297
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,857
What are you doing?

298
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,397
Hey, what are you doing?

299
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,822
- I hate you.
- Yeah, I love you.

300
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:36,706
You realize I'll just have to buy another
limited edition Shelby Super Snake...

301
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:41,370
...take another six months to re-time the cams,
open up the intake and customize it.

302
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,913
And then I'm gonna drive
it over your face.

303
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,674
- You sure know a lot about cars for--
- A girl?

304
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,255
Yeah.

305
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,212
Wow.

306
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:56,017
<i>I like fast cars and computers
and boy things, how butch.</i>

307
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,098
It's the 21st century,
you should join it.

308
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,191
- What are you doing?
- I'm documenting this shit.

309
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,602
I'm not going to jail
after we get arrested.

310
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,863
- Well, nobody's gonna get caught, okay?
- That's right, I forgot.

311
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:14,243
We're just gonna die because you're a dumb-ass
who attacks the police with a damn car.

312
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,244
Now every cop in this entire country...

313
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,373
...is hoping to put a couple bullets
in our heads. Good plan.

314
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,954
- We are alive.
- Barely.

315
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,794
Not much of a thinker are you?

316
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,547
Well, I didn't actually graduate
from charm school like you...

317
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,051
...so maybe someday you can give me
some tutoring or something.

318
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,306
This is what he did
to my beautiful, beautiful paint job.

319
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,807
Just get in the car.

320
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:41,391
This is all the crap that he drilled
into my carbon fiber interior.

321
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,476
This is the dumb-ass
who got me into this mess.

322
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,233
- Stop filming me, all right?
- Wave hi to the judge.

323
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:51,522
- Say hi to all your new friends in jail.
- Hey! Put that away! I'm trying-- Just stop it.

324
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,119
What is--? You're like ADD or something.
What are you fiddling with now?

325
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,995
- Stop doing that.
- Why?

326
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,907
Because this guy is watching us, okay?

327
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,577
- I need you to stop--
- I know what I'm doing.

328
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,247
- Just listen to me for two seconds.
- I know what I'm doing.

329
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,507
See, I went to school
and I know things...

330
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,966
...which is why I don't have to
steal stuff, like some people.

331
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:19,179
If you're so smart, you tell me what's
going on with all these cameras, huh?

332
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,109
They're all linked to a single feed.

333
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:33,774
It's not only encrypted, but it's
piggybacking on a public server.

334
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,065
Huh?

335
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,286
It means they're hosting
this live feed from these cameras...

336
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,323
...on a government server
without them knowing about it.

337
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,994
So anybody can watch it, even us.

338
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,008
- Wait a second.
- What?

339
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,341
- These aren't coming from the same place.
- Where are they coming from?

340
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,552
Looks like a parking garage.

341
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,468
- Can you tell where it is?
- I don't know. Could be anywhere.

342
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,389
- Do you think it's where he might be?
- Doubt it. But he can see it.

343
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,182
I don't like that he's watching us.

344
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,476
Do you think you can track him
with that thing?

345
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,737
No, and if anyone did,
he would just dump the IP address.

346
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:17,616
As long as his feed is hosted remotely,
there's no way to find it.

347
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,072
- And that thing isn't really well-hidden.
- What?

348
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,578
Microphone.

349
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,160
- Oh, so he's listening to us too?
- Probably.

350
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,328
Well, I'll give you this,
you are bright.

351
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,169
It's called being educated.

352
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,085
You should look into it
when you're not committing crimes.

353
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,004
Scratch that, you'll be in jail.

354
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,184
All right, answer.

355
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,695
Pull up power plant on the GPS.

356
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,740
We're kind of busy right now.

357
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,443
Learn to multitask.

358
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,703
Or let your new little friend help you.
Look under the visor.

359
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,702
<i>Won't you do that?</i>

360
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,376
<i>I'm uploading a new set of directions.</i>

361
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,629
That's the city power plant.

362
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,424
At exactly 11 :30...</i>

363
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,963
...you will be there.

364
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,975
Why are we going to the power plant?

365
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,722
Always so inquisitive.

366
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,562
I like it.

367
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,618
Listen carefully,
you're to break into the control room.

368
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,166
Access the remote system...

369
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,418
...and insert that drive.
- What will that do?

370
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,375
You're a clever girl.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

371
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:00,502
He wants to cut the power off.
Why do you want to cut the power?

372
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,137
You have some time until 11:30.

373
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,641
I wouldn't spend it
trying to figure out my motives.

374
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,017
He's a real asshole.

375
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,471
So you don't know who that is?

376
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,305
No.

377
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,312
- No idea?
- I got ideas.

378
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,815
People I used to work with...

379
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,481
...but nobody I know could set up
something like this.

380
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,659
- So why you?
- Because I can drive.

381
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,490
- That's debatable.
- No, I mean, I used to race.

382
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,459
- Really?
- Really.

383
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:17,337
Professionally, like, real racing.

384
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,669
Don't think I ever saw you on TV.

385
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,334
There was a couple weeks
there where you might have.

386
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,423
And?

387
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,847
And what?

388
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,220
I washed out.

389
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,562
How come?

390
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:42,062
I don't know, I just did.
Doesn't matter now.

391
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,023
That's a pretty shitty answer.

392
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,954
I washed out because I believed
everybody who told me how great I was.

393
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:59,371
Turns out the only thing I was great at
was wrecking expensive cars.

394
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,583
So I fell off the pro circuit
and I owed a bunch of money.

395
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,377
This is the only thing
I was ever any good at...

396
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,714
...so I took whatever job
paid the most.

397
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,431
I did some things I'm not proud of.

398
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,892
But then I got out of it. And this...

399
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,735
...is why.

400
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,027
She's beautiful.

401
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,162
- Is she from here?
- Yeah.

402
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,420
She always wanted to come back,
so we thought...

403
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:44,504
...it'd be a good place
to lay low and start over.

404
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,510
Then I come home from work today,
the door is busted open...

405
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:51,014
...the place is a wreck,
there's blood on the floor.

406
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:56,850
My cell phone rings and this voice tells me
if I ever wanna s--

407
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,978
If I ever wanna see her again...

408
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,019
...I gotta do this job.

409
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,566
And if I tell anyone, she'll be dead.

410
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:16,494
Next thing I know,
I'm driving around in your car.

411
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,455
You souped this thing up yourself?

412
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,842
Yeah, it was a graduation present.

413
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,387
Nice. Something tells me
your dad's not a mechanic.

414
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,142
He's the CEO
of one of the largest banks in town.

415
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:40,351
We moved here about two years ago
for him to take it over.

416
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:46,570
I barely see him, but this car
is the nicest gift he ever gave me.

417
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,982
Well, I'm sorry about all the damage.

418
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:57,205
You know, you could also apologize
for taking me hostage.

419
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,041
You could apologize
for putting a gun in my face.

420
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,747
I will if you let me out.

421
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,334
There's only one thing
I'm concerned about right now...

422
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,501
...and I'm gonna do whatever I have to
to get her back.

423
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,171
So if he says you gotta stay in the car,
you gotta stay in the car.

424
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,010
And where does that get you?

425
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,100
Why is this happening?
What is he after?

426
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,183
You clearly haven't
thought this through.

427
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:26,063
What happens when this is done
and he gets what he wants?

428
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,945
Why would he even give her back to you?

429
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,449
If I were him, I'd kill her
and I'd probably kill you.

430
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,612
- Shit.
- What?

431
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,122
I'd probably kill me too.

432
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,396
Looks like they've already been here.

433
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,363
If he was already here, why didn't
he just take out the power himself?

434
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,441
I don't know.

435
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:17,911
Stop here.

436
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,953
Why?

437
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,083
Ever see what happens to a metal car...

438
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,246
...when it touches a transformer
that powers the whole city?

439
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,920
- Just wait here, I'll handle it.
- What, alone?

440
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,584
Yeah, just be ready to go.

441
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,336
You sure?

442
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,149
Turn the car around,
that's what I should do.

443
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,989
No, I should go in after her.

444
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,829
No, she's fine.
She knows what she's doing.

445
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,048
Hello? I don't have much time.

446
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,834
I'm in this car with this man
and his wife was kidnapped.

447
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,718
<i>I speak English. Calm yourself.</i>

448
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,005
Could you just send someone, please?

449
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,265
<i>- What is your, uh, emergency?
- I don't know.</i>

450
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,347
It's this voice telling us what to do.
You have to help us.

451
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,514
<i>- Exactly what is your location?
- I'm at the power plant.</i>

452
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,150
- You make it so much fun.
- Shit.

453
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,734
Wherever that clever mind takes you,
remember, I've already been there.

454
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,024
<i>Look around.</i>

455
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,946
<i>You see? That's right.</i>

456
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,743
The police will think
you blew up the power station.

457
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,124
Can I give you some advice? Run.

458
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,173
Come on, come on.

459
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,385
- Go, go, go!
- What, what, what?

460
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,220
- Drive, drive! Go!
- What happened?

461
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,654
- Hold on.
- Shit.

462
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,248
Aah!

463
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:32,518
Faster!

464
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,479
Go faster!

465
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:48,704
Oh!

466
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,581
What are you doing? What are you doing?

467
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,872
I'm not dying for you.

468
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,709
- What happened?
- This is a part of his plan.

469
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,169
I was on camera that whole time.

470
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,882
He could have taken out the power
himself, but he lured us in there...

471
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,888
...because he wanted me
to get caught on camera doing it.

472
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,550
You think the cops
would ever believe me now?

473
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,729
Before, it was just you...

474
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,605
...this car.

475
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,229
But now I'm screwed too.

476
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,278
I'm sorry.

477
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,194
I gotta take care of myself.

478
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,380
<i>- Answer.
- Stop her from leaving.</i>

479
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,550
Go to hell.

480
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,553
<i>Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me? Wait. Wait.</i>

481
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,764
Leanne? Leanne, can you hear me?

482
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,724
Can you--? Please.

483
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,810
Leanne, can you hear me?

484
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,645
<i>Brent. Brent, what's going on?</i>

485
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,434
Are you okay? Have they hurt you?

486
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,319
<i>- Why is this happening?
- Leanne.</i>

487
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:46,698
<i>- Please help me! Brent?
- Leanne, are you all right, baby?</i>

488
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,574
<i>Please help me!
I'm so scared.</i>

489
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,485
I'm coming after you.
I'm gonna make all this better.

490
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,369
- I'm gonna get--
Aah!

491
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,452
What--?

492
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,749
Put my wife back on! Put her back on!

493
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,630
Is my wife all right?

494
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:07,552
<i>I told you not
to let her out of the car.</i>

495
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,883
<i>- I just need to see if she's--
- I warned you.</i>

496
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,950
I'm sorry.

497
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:33,699
It's not your fault.

498
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:40,285
I know what it's like to disappoint everyone,
but I never thought that I'd let her down.

499
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,166
She's still alive.

500
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,676
You don't have to do this.

501
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,890
I want to.

502
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:18,490
Where are you? Where are you?

503
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:37,808
What are you doing?

504
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,560
We gotta figure out his plan.

505
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,514
Oh, shit.

506
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,130
Get down, get down. Come on.

507
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,741
Okay, okay.

508
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,584
He was having you make this.

509
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:53,293
You're blocking off a path.
Half of these are one-way streets.

510
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:57,464
With these intersections blocked off,
no one will be able to get through here.

511
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,847
Until they clean this mess up, there'll
only be one way out of the city.

512
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,387
The rest will be a total shit show.

513
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:07,436
It's an escape route.

514
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,441
I just wish I knew what he was after.

515
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,406
You and me both.

516
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,301
<i>- Answer.
- I have good news for you.</i>

517
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,086
<i>This is your last assignment.</i>

518
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:40,553
<i>Look up number five in the GPS.</i>

519
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:44,015
<i>Follow the directions precisely.
You have 10 minutes.</i>

520
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,646
- It's the bank.
- What bank?

521
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,729
- He wants us to rob my dad's bank.
- Oh, shit.

522
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,397
We can't do that.

523
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,403
<i>Do as instructed. The clock is ticking.</i>

524
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:57,736
You can't. There's no way we could do that.
The security's way too tight.

525
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,401
<i>Don't concern yourself with security.</i>

526
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:04,163
<i>- He wants us to get caught.
- Follow the GPS. Turn around.</i>

527
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,700
This is a suicide mission.
Listen, we can't do this.

528
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,834
<i>Ignore her.
Listen to me. Turn around now.</i>

529
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:11,872
<i>- Am I gonna see my wife again?
- Turn around.</i>

530
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:14,336
<i>- I'm losing my patience with you.
- Listen to me.</i>

531
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:18,002
- No.
- I need to know when I'm going to see my wife.

532
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,592
<i>No, turn the car around.
This is your last warning.</i>

533
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:25,386
I need to be told that she is all right
and when this shit is gonna be over!

534
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:29,021
<i>Do you want to see her again?</i>

535
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,978
<i>Get control of yourself
and turn the car around.</i>

536
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,360
You can't do this.

537
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,535
- Listen to me, this is a setup.
- He will kill her.

538
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,872
That's why they used my car.
it had to be me. Think about it.

539
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,413
My dad, he cut off all of my funds.

540
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,082
Now my car is causing havoc
all over the city...

541
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,795
...and I'm seen robbing his bank?

542
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,253
He wants us to get caught.

543
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:15,060
- What does he wanna steal?
- Money.

544
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,732
But that's just it,
it's not that kind of bank.

545
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,068
- What do you mean?
- My dad runs an investment bank.

546
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,233
- There's no cash.
- Oh, shit!

547
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,787
- God.
- So, what, safety deposit boxes?

548
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:37,423
No, there's nothing like that in there,
just computers.

549
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,593
- Bonds. Bearer bonds.
- Bearer bonds? How old are you?

550
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,342
What is he after, then?
What's he trying to steal?

551
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:48,808
Unless...

552
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,180
Hold on!

553
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:59,612
- Unless what?
- Unless you don't want a record of your money.

554
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,114
- Right, right, like it's dirty money.
- Exactly.

555
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,328
- How do you move dirty money?
- Look out, look out!

556
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,996
- Come on, help me.
- They could encrypt the information...

557
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,379
...on a numeric transfer key.
A flash drive with account numbers.

558
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,131
If you stole one of these
little transfer keys, right...?

559
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,213
- You could drain the accounts.
- Right.

560
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:25,342
No one would report that money stolen,
it's not supposed to exist.

561
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:28,136
- How much are we talking about?
- It could be billions.

562
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,639
I should have been a banker.

563
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,513
Tell me that you're not serious.

564
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,478
Shit!

565
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,820
- I'm gonna go for it.
- No, don't go for it!

566
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,326
Here we go!

567
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:53,870
That was awesome.

568
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:55,792
Aah!

569
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,803
Aah! Get us out of here!

570
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,683
Watch out.

571
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,027
I really, really hate you.

572
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,410
I can understand that.

573
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,978
- What are you doing?
- Just wait.

574
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,647
Okay, just sit still and
be quiet for a minute.

575
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,245
- Okay, it's done. I bought us some time.
- What?

576
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:25,087
I hacked into the server connected to these
cameras, put on a loop of us driving.

577
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,672
- That's what he can see right now.
- Why?

578
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,257
So that you'll listen to me.

579
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,515
When we get there, we're gonna get
caught and your wife will die.

580
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,016
We're his decoys.

581
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,428
- Great.
- The power's out...

582
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:40,223
...which means the security
infrastructure has been compromised.

583
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:43,108
And when that happens,
there's a procedure. Oh, shit.

584
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,066
My dad said something about this.

585
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,696
They're being moved.
They're moving them right now.

586
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,788
They move anything sensitive to a secure
location until the system is back up...

587
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:59,041
...and then they run a million tests.
- By the time we get there--

588
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,042
We'll be robbing an empty bank.

589
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,670
Please, let's just find a place
to look at it first.

590
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,457
I guarantee you it's swarming with cops.

591
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,127
How long do we have?

592
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,796
I don't know, five,
maybe 10 minutes at the most.

593
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,514
Watch where you're going, asshole!

594
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:25,936
<i>It's the most wonderful time of the year</i>

595
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,488
<i>With the kids jingle-belling</i>

596
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:34,494
<i>And everyone telling you
"Be of good cheer"</i>

597
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:39,704
<i>It's the most wonderful time of the year</i>

598
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,624
I'll go check it.

599
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,018
So you were right?

600
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,611
I wish I wasn't.

601
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:12,698
So, what do we do now?

602
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,408
I'm thinking.

603
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,947
You said there was a procedure.
if the power goes out, they'll move the drives?

604
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,786
- Yeah.
- Where do they move them?

605
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,872
I don't know, it's classified
information for the bank.

606
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,707
Right. Shit.

607
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:29,089
But they gotta get picked up.
They have to be picked up from here.

608
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,297
They've got all these cops here
waiting for us.

609
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,508
I mean, what, is there a back door?
ls there another entrance?

610
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,097
Remember that parking spot that we saw?

611
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,562
You asked if I thought
that's where he was?

612
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:50,899
- Yeah.
- Well, I bet he's there now.

613
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,947
I told you you were bright.

614
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,495
Let's go.

615
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:18,733
Yeah.

616
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:24,698
Three, one, nine, seven, two,
one, three, four, two, six.

617
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,212
What?

618
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,010
Go, go, go!

619
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:46,018
- You got it?
- Yeah, go!

620
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,848
Get them!

621
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,577
Answer me.

622
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,246
Answer me, answer me.

623
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,541
Answer!

624
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,459
Answer.

625
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:16,882
You're dead. Your wife is dead.
It's over! Don't play with me!

626
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,883
We hold the cards now, asshole!

627
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:55,121
Could you be a little bit more careful?

628
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,791
How do I get this drive out?

629
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:01,752
Got it!

630
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:07,974
Knock him! Hit him!

631
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,185
Holy shit!

632
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,619
Oh, my God, go!

633
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:40,299
- Get down, get down, get down!
- Do something!

634
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,878
Please, get us out of here!

635
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,013
Oh!

636
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,649
- Look out!
- Hold on!

637
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,061
This is Sofia Police Department.

638
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,438
- Shit.
- Pull over the car now!

639
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:37,848
Lose them.

640
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,356
Driver, pull over car now!

641
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,521
We're trapped.
Sit back. Hold on. You ready?

642
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:49,072
All right.
Where's the gun? Where's the gun?

643
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,409
- Give me the gun!
- Keep your hands where we can see them.

644
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:56,371
Now, just go with me on this,
all right? Just go with me.

645
00:58:56,533 --> 00:59:00,254
Back off! Or I will shoot her head!
I will blow her brains out!

646
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:03,131
Back off! Hey! Hey! See this?

647
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,713
Back off, or I'm killing this girl,
you hear me?

648
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:09,255
- I will kill this girl right now!
- What the hell are you doing?

649
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:12,721
I am going to blow her head off!
Now, you. You. Yeah, you!

650
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,556
You okay? Hey!

651
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,892
Back, back, back!
Or I'm killing this girl, you hear me?

652
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,683
Back off! Back off!

653
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,232
That's it, you're doing great.

654
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,735
Get out of my way, copper.

655
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,243
I can't believe that worked.

656
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:57,474
They're clear.
I've sent you their location.

657
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:59,559
Intercept them.

658
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,777
What are you doing?

659
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,038
- I'm gonna let you out.
- What?

660
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,291
Come on. You're not a suspect anymore.

661
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,123
They think I kidnapped you.
Tell them you were a hostage.

662
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,162
- No, I'm--
- I'm serious. I'm serious.

663
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,458
You've done more than enough for me.
I can't risk your life anymore.

664
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,878
- I really can't. You gotta get out, okay?
- No.

665
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:34,014
- Get out of the car.
- No.

666
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:38,473
- Come on, get out of the car, will you?
- I'm coming with you.

667
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,514
You're an extremely stubborn person,
all right, you know that?

668
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,975
I know.

669
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:48,028
But I'm still not getting
out of this car.

670
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:54,492
Besides, without me, you'd probably do
something stupid, like get your face shot off.

671
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,368
All right.

672
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,585
You don't even know my name, do you?

673
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:12,044
No.

674
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,591
Aah! Go!

675
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:28,852
Damn it!

676
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:41,373
- Ow!
- Are you all right?

677
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,452
Hit him!

678
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,730
Damn it!

679
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:29,579
Get down, get down!

680
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,422
Down!

681
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,848
Look out!

682
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,309
Oh, God.

683
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,607
Get us off the train!

684
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,775
- Where's the gun? Find the gun!
- I don't know!

685
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:00,944
- Find the gun!
- I'm looking!

686
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,488
Find it!

687
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,537
- You got it? Give it to me!
- I found it! Here!

688
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,546
Just hold the wheel for a second!

689
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,216
I need you to downshift! You ready?

690
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,635
NOW!

691
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,513
I have an idea.

692
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,561
Get out.

693
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,532
So we meet up with him.

694
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,042
We do an exchange.
The drive for your wife.

695
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,794
It'll never work. He'll kill us.

696
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,295
I have a way around it.

697
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:40,552
We use his camera to feed the video
to the cops. They'll see everything.

698
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,671
Answer the phone.

699
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:29,976
<i>- Answer.
- You think you are so smart?</i>

700
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:32,604
<i>- I wouldn't be so--
- No, shut up and listen.</i>

701
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,685
We have what you want,
let's make a trade.

702
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:37,476
- Where?
- You know where I work?

703
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,269
I'll see you there in two hours.

704
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,146
Goodnight, asshole.

705
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,492
Where's my wife?

706
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:15,623
Where's my drive?

707
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,470
Where's my wife?

708
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,152
- No. No! No!
- Leanne!

709
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,406
Brent?

710
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,611
I need to know they're real.

711
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,496
You. Follow him.

712
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:07,841
Let her go first.

713
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:32,192
Oh, thank God you're here.

714
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,951
I love you.

715
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,304
I'm waiting.

716
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:57,809
Waiting.

717
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:12,820
Let's go.

718
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,329
- Shoot them.
- Brent, look out!

719
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,039
No! No!

720
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,178
- Throw her in!
- No! Aah!

721
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:35,680
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

722
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:40,889
Shit, they got the kid.

723
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,768
- I gotta go after her.
- Go get her.

724
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,774
- You stay with the police.
- Be careful.

725
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,401
Damn it!

726
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,419
Are you hurt, ma'am?

727
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,138
Shit.

728
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,102
He has a gun on me.

729
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,939
Brent, he has a gun.

730
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:37,525
Please hear me.

731
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,988
<i>I hope you can see this.</i>

732
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,328
Quiet! Don't talk.

733
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,174
<i>Brent, I'm trying
to show you where we are.</i>

734
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:02,926
Move out of my way!

735
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:11,442
Brent, yes!

736
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,696
- You're screwed, asshole!
- Shut up!

737
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,869
Come on, come on.

738
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:43,641
Oh!

739
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:55,899
Damn it!

740
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,828
What are you doing? Is that a camera?

741
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,994
- Give it to me, give it to me!
- No, give it back!

742
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,888
Ah, shit! Bastard.

743
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,281
Damn it!

744
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,515
Oh, shit.

745
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,551
Shit.

746
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:45,383
The only way out of the city.

747
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,714
I know where she is.

748
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:26,257
- Pull over! Give me the gun!
- What are you doing? Stop it!

749
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,008
You want us to die?

750
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,613
Come on, come on!

751
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:25,706
- Get out!
- What?

752
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:27,707
Now!

753
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,781
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

754
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,162
Stay there.
You're under arrest.

755
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,383
Thanks.

756
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:25,098
Everybody back!

757
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:35,437
Ugh!

758
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,614
- I guess I owe you one, huh?
- And you owe me a new car.

759
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:44,952
Don't worry about the car. It just needs
a new paint job and she'll be fine.

760
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:02,594
- What's that?
- I don't know.

761
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,594
It's not mine.

762
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,479
<i>- Hello?
- Aren't you going to thank me?</i>

763
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:15,360
<i>I did for you
what you could never do for yourself.</i>

764
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:17,897
<i>I showed you what you are made of.</i>

765
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:23,286
<i>Please excuse me
if I wasn't able to be there in person.</i>

766
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,497
<i>I'm sure you understand,
under the circumstances...</i>

767
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:29,078
<i>...it would have been
most inconvenient for me.</i>

768
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:33,166
<i>If you're asking yourself
who I am to you...</i>

769
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:38,255
<i>...I will answer very simply:
I am your greatest fan.</i>

770
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:42,175
<i>I always thought you could have been
at the top of your profession...</i>

771
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:44,841
<i>...if only you believed you could.</i>

772
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:47,593
<i>So that's it, you see.</i>

773
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:53,482
<i>Please send your lovely wife my
best wishes for a happy Christmas.</i>

774
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:58,020
<i>I'm sincerely glad you worked things out
to be with her for the holidays.</i>

775
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:04,782
<i>It's the season to be together
with loved ones, so I'm told.</i>

776
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:07,617
<i>I have very few loved ones.</i>

777
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:14,663
<i>My consolation is I have
a lot of money.</i>

778
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:18,378
<i>And now, quite a lot more
of it, thanks to you.</i>

779
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:24,506
<i>I doubt if our paths will cross again,
but then, life is full of surprises.</i>

780
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:28,976
<i>So let's just say au revoir.</i>

781
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:33,981
<i>Be assured,
it's been most entertaining.</i>
