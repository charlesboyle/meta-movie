1
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,041
Globodyne is a consolidator
of media properties.

2
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:12,853
Globodyne is a consolidator of media
properties. Consolidator. Oh, no!

3
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,866
Globodyne's a consolidator of
media properties and data retrieval...

4
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:21,076
...with a focus in fiber-optic
content provision.

5
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:22,903
It's basically a synergy
of Web-based...

6
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:26,233
...and platform-based
UNIX-driven delivery systems.

7
00:01:26,397 --> 00:01:28,340
Okay, I made that last part up.

8
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:33,017
We spent months on this trip.
I just assumed...

9
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,640
...that you knew you needed
a passport to get into Russia.

10
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:41,467
But if I should have told you,
then I'm really sorry, Mr. Fairbanks.

11
00:01:45,794 --> 00:01:48,730
It's not my fault airport security
strip-searched you, Mr. Fairbanks.

12
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:53,155
I mean, maybe you shouldn't have
made that joke. You know?

13
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:54,561
Hon? Fire.

14
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:57,890
You know what, I'm gonna
load you up with drink coupons.

15
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:02,183
Blanca? Can you make this little man
something to eat?

16
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:14,471
Are you sure about this?

17
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:17,092
The trainer said it's just
a minor annoyance.

18
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,393
He said it just reminds him
to be a little less vocal.

19
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:01,522
- Hey, Dick.
- Morning, Joe.

20
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:04,180
That a new car?

21
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:06,161
It's the new Mercedes S500.

22
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:08,568
You can only special-order
these from Germany.

23
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:12,212
- How's it run?
- Well, it's a Mercedes.

24
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,290
Check this out.

25
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:16,859
Mercedes, on.

26
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:22,005
Yeah? Well, watch this.

27
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:24,893
Beemer, sit. Stay.

28
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:27,609
Play dead. Good boy.

29
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:30,713
That's cute, Dick. Mercedes, off.

30
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,559
"It has come to our attention
that certain departments...

31
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:01,632
...have begun to run into situations."
Situations.

32
00:04:01,802 --> 00:04:03,843
The big boys want
to see you upstairs.

33
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:06,113
Which floor? Twentieth?

34
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:07,907
Twenty-sixth?

35
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:10,022
Thirty-second?

36
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,322
- Not the 51st?
- Yes.

37
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:16,389
Congratulations, Mr. Harper.

38
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:21,070
- Go ahead and wrap this up.
- Okay.

39
00:04:21,232 --> 00:04:22,378
- How do I look?
- Great.

40
00:04:22,544 --> 00:04:24,333
- Anything in my teeth?
- No.

41
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,286
I need a paper bag.

42
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:33,969
- Hey, Oz.
- Hey, Dick. Morning.

43
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:36,554
It is, isn't it? Sure is.

44
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:38,285
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:41,042
Hey, did you... ?
Did you hear about Bill?

46
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:45,358
- Oh, yeah. That's.... That's wild.
- Yeah.

47
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:50,287
Yeah. I wonder.... I wonder
who's gonna take his place.

48
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:53,973
That's the big mystery.

49
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:55,993
Yeah. Yeah.

50
00:04:58,684 --> 00:05:01,499
- You getting off?
- Not this time, Oz.

51
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:03,804
Son of a bitch!

52
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,282
That's it.

53
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,908
Hello. I'm...

54
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,295
...Dick Harper, and I'm here
to see Jack McAllister.

55
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,351
Oh, well, that's him now, sorry.
He had to step out.

56
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:21,616
Dick.

57
00:06:22,163 --> 00:06:24,400
Damn glad to finally see you
up here.

58
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:28,466
Hey, man.

59
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:33,901
- Frank Bascombe, CFO.
- Nice to meet you, Frank.

60
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,340
Nice to meet you.
Listen, Dick. Dick.

61
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:39,570
Jack's very sorry that he couldn't
be here to congratulate you.

62
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:43,151
Well, on becoming the new
VP of Communication.

63
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:45,462
Are you--?

64
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:48,021
- Holy.... Thank you.
- No, no, no.

65
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:50,740
But also, he wanted to invite you
to his house...

66
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:53,810
...for an orientation meeting
on Monday morning.

67
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:02,230
Dick? Ann's got the address.

68
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:06,011
All right. Sure, I'll get that.
Okay. Ann?

69
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,518
- Thanks.
- Sure.

70
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:09,371
And thank you...

71
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:11,771
...Frank.

72
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,090
Cool exit.

73
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,428
How do you like your eggs?

74
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,273
Pardon me!

75
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:34,502
Ours is an age
of unmeasured prosperity,

76
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,158
Oh, yeah.

77
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,506
- You know what?
- What?

78
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:39,364
You should quit your job.

79
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:41,414
- Quit my job?
- Yeah.

80
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:44,936
Do you even know what you're getting
paid? I mean, I can't quit my job.

81
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:47,270
Well, not specifically, but....

82
00:07:47,787 --> 00:07:51,334
Bob got VP last month,
he's making 1 50 plus bonuses.

83
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:54,310
Come on, you wanna spend
more time with Billy.

84
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:56,550
Do it. Just-- Come on.

85
00:07:56,717 --> 00:07:58,857
Do it. Do it. Quit your job.

86
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:00,713
We must never become
a winner-take-all society,

87
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,247
- You know what we should do?
- What?

88
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:06,439
We should have sex...

89
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,749
...on Saturday.

90
00:08:08,914 --> 00:08:10,026
I'll buy candles.

91
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:13,260
I'll pick up the new Starbucks sampler
featuring Sade.

92
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:17,105
Oh, you animal.
That is gonna be so wild.

93
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:18,611
Yeah.

94
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:33,843
Thank you.

95
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:37,680
Just make yourself at home.

96
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:39,347
Right.

97
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:51,608
Dick.

98
00:08:51,774 --> 00:08:53,847
Yeah. Mr. McAllister.

99
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:57,786
- Dick. Hey, call me Jack.
- Likewise.

100
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,268
With my name. Dick, I mean.

101
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:04,375
Man. Dick Harper.

102
00:09:04,546 --> 00:09:06,007
Dick Harper.

103
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:10,238
Dick Harper playing the harp.
Harpo Marx playing the jew's-harp.

104
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,049
D.H. DH.

105
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:15,071
You're my designated hitter.

106
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:17,246
I need you to step up
into the batter's box...

107
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:19,323
...and knock one out
of the ballpark for me.

108
00:09:19,494 --> 00:09:21,119
- Gone.
- You ever have a nickname?

109
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:23,837
Well, it was....

110
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:26,245
Squirt. The Squirt.

111
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:29,257
Something about how I was
conceived, I don't know.

112
00:09:29,865 --> 00:09:32,735
We gonna think of something.
Have trouble finding the place?

113
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:37,031
No, sir. By the way, what a absolutely
beautiful hou-- Home you have.

114
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:38,984
So then my lawyer says
to her lawyer:

115
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:41,897
"lf she thinks she's getting that yacht,
she's a little dingy."

116
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:46,026
He always-- He loves that one.

117
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,841
The point is
that we need somebody...

118
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,014
...who projects confidence
in this position.

119
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:52,710
We've seen how
you handle yourself.

120
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,215
You've been a great cheerleader
for this company.

121
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:56,838
So we were thinking that....

122
00:09:57,617 --> 00:10:00,433
- Well, you go ahead and tell him.
- No, you go ahead.

123
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:06,701
What's up, guys? Come on.
Don't hold out on me here. What?

124
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:09,072
We want you to go on
MoneyLife this afternoon...

125
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:11,375
...and announce
our quarterly projections.

126
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:16,177
You're the guy.
You're the guy we have faith in.

127
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:18,286
You can get our positive spin
out there.

128
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,776
Right. Positive spin.

129
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:23,832
These are fickle times, Dick.

130
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:26,547
We need to stick together
as a team.

131
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:30,003
Like my daddy always used to say....

132
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:39,224
Well, you can count on me, sir.

133
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,659
I mean, I can't tell you
how happy I am.

134
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:46,008
- Thank you.
- How were those eggs Florentine?

135
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:48,669
- Best I've ever had.
- Good answer.

136
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:54,458
I'm on the plane right now!

137
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:57,310
Do you know what's sitting
in front of me? Do you know?

138
00:10:57,474 --> 00:11:00,378
A kosher meal! A kosher meal!

139
00:11:00,547 --> 00:11:03,745
How many times do I need to tell
you? ! I don't need a kosher meal!

140
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:05,185
I'm Episcopalian!

141
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:08,862
No-- No, you, miss-- You--
No, you grow up!

142
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:10,787
For-- No, you, miss--

143
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,985
Phyllis, can l... ?
Can I talk to you for a minute?

144
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:16,356
- Here's a yell!
- It's personal.

145
00:11:17,607 --> 00:11:20,837
- Never actually had makeup on.
- I'm happy for you.

146
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:23,588
- Hi.
- Hi.

147
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,472
- Where's Sam?
- Washington.

148
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:29,153
These are your talking points.
They were just faxed over.

149
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:31,212
And Sam is on the line for you.

150
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:32,803
Hello, Mr, Harper,

151
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:36,269
Hey, Sam. How you doing?
Nice talking to you.

152
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,602
I thought you were gonna be here.

153
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:40,939
- Me too, I hear it's beautiful there,
- That's the thing--

154
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:43,012
- Okay, Dick, we're on in five,
- Yep, sure.

155
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:45,224
- -three, two....

156
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:56,882
Today we're talking with the new VP
of Communications at Globodyne...

157
00:11:57,044 --> 00:11:59,084
... Dick Harper,
How you doing, Dick?

158
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,194
Just terrific, Sam.
Thank you for asking.

159
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:03,372
And so is Globodyne, by the way.

160
00:12:04,246 --> 00:12:07,411
Now, Dick, tell me,
what is the shareholder to make...

161
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:10,575
...of the fact that Jack McAllister,
your CEO...

162
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:13,559
...has unloaded a considerable share
of his stocks?

163
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:21,623
I think CEOs sell their stocks
for many reasons, Sam.

164
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:24,059
Both professional and personal.

165
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:27,602
Actually, over the past year, Jack
McAllister has sold 80 percent...

166
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:29,561
...of his holdings
through shell companies,

167
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:32,540
Now, how do you explain that?

168
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:37,467
The reasons for doing something
like that would be--

169
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,414
Losing you there. Hold on.

170
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:43,708
The reasons for doing something
like that would be.... Could be many.

171
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,522
Both....

172
00:12:49,154 --> 00:12:52,123
There's also talk of some of
the Globodyne portfolio documents...

173
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:53,306
... being subpoenaed,

174
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:57,503
Specifically those of your CFO,
Frank Bascombe,

175
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,144
Now, joining us with his insights,
is presidential hopeful Ralph Nader,

176
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,868
Really?

177
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:08,894
Hi, Ralph. Big fan, love your stuff.

178
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:11,880
I wish I could say the same,
I don't know how you sleep at night,

179
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:16,740
Corporations like Globodyne
pervert the American dream,

180
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:18,019
The super-rich get richer,

181
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:20,612
You are a disgrace,

182
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:24,930
Ralph, I don't know where
you're getting your statistics.

183
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:28,262
I can only say that, in my estimation,
Globodyne is transparent.

184
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,697
We'd be more than willing
to share any and all documentation.

185
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:39,055
What is going on?

186
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:41,584
Can somebody tell me
what the heck is--?

187
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,896
Hey, there's a fi-- Somebody should--

188
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,753
Okay.

189
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:50,381
This can't be good.

190
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,558
Out of my way!

191
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:54,798
- Hey, that's my ficus!
- My ficus!

192
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:58,796
You're not even from this floor!
Help! Security!

193
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:05,135
What's going on?

194
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:09,135
Oh, so Dick finally wants to know
what's going on.

195
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:11,797
Frank?

196
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,406
Methinks somebody made
a boo-boo.

197
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:19,354
Maybe we didn't know how to
use Quicken. Yeah, that could be it.

198
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:23,515
Frank. Frank. Try to focus. Okay?
What's happening to Globodyne?

199
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:26,842
- Globodyne?
- Yeah, what happened, Frank?

200
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:31,198
- We took our shifting losses...
- Yeah?

201
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:34,815
- ... and we put them into businesses...
- Yeah, yeah?

202
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:37,438
...that we actually owned.

203
00:14:37,602 --> 00:14:39,325
And then the balance sheet...

204
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,596
...it showed profit.

205
00:14:41,763 --> 00:14:43,968
But actually, there was...

206
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:46,332
...debt.

207
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,930
What the hell? !

208
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,716
You're sick.

209
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,630
- I want you to hit me.
- Frank, let go of me now.

210
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:55,904
- I want you to hit me.
- Let go, you're scaring me.

211
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:58,406
- Hit me.
- Frank! Get off!

212
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:02,591
And I have the 6000 greatest
partners a man could ask for,

213
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:11,590
Mr. McAllister?

214
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:13,185
I don't know what to tell you.

215
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:17,186
We're just a cell in a much larger
organism called the global economy.

216
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:21,385
Weak companies have to die so that
stronger companies can get stronger.

217
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:24,104
- It's just nature.
- Nature? What?

218
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:26,541
You ever read Walden Pond?
It's all in there.

219
00:15:26,704 --> 00:15:28,494
Hey, you send him a copy
of the tape.

220
00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:30,480
What about the other employees, sir?

221
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:32,366
They're gonna be fine.
Don't go there.

222
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:35,018
This is America,
the land of opportunity.

223
00:15:36,242 --> 00:15:40,848
I don't know, sir. With all due respect,
this doesn't feel right.

224
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:45,324
Step away from the rotors now, boy.
They gonna chop your head clean off.

225
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:13,652
Honey? I'm home.

226
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:17,110
Oh, and the vice president is home!

227
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,124
I see you got them digging
the hot tub.

228
00:16:24,288 --> 00:16:27,136
I know. Yes, I called the guy.
They came right out.

229
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,765
- That almost never happens.
- I know. We're so lucky.

230
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:37,756
Dinner's ready!

231
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:46,591
- Look at it!
- Oh, my gosh!

232
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:49,695
Look! I did it and it's perfect!

233
00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:53,695
My gosh! That could feed
a family of four.

234
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:57,730
I mean.... I-- In my--
Look at that, Billy.

235
00:16:57,962 --> 00:17:00,418
I'm surprised you left off the hooves.

236
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:05,795
You know, before we get into that,
I have some wonderful news.

237
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:07,820
Mama quit her job!

238
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:12,875
- I did. I did, I did!
- You did?

239
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,888
- Isn't that great?
- My gosh! That's incredible!

240
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:19,309
Oh, the timing of it, it was just
beautiful, Dick. And, oh, thank you.

241
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,000
I just-- I just did it!

242
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:23,723
No. Oh, boy.

243
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:25,167
And now, you know what...

244
00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:27,721
...I can spend so much more time
with my beautiful boy.

245
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:31,470
- Yeah.
- Now, what's your news, big Mr. VP?

246
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:35,827
I have something
of an announcement to make.

247
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:41,619
It turns out that a very wonderful
opportunity has just presented itself...

248
00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:44,563
...in the form of me...

249
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:48,119
...not necessarily working
at Globodyne anymore.

250
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,464
Were you fired?

251
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:54,423
I wasn't fired. Globodyne tanked.

252
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,086
- Dick!
- Jeez. "Fired."

253
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:58,871
What do you mean?
How could that happen?

254
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,002
They just gave you
a promotion. And--

255
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,789
There is nothing to worry about.
I'll get my severance...

256
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,966
...money from my pension.
We're fine.

257
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:10,646
I am a winner.
Billy, tell your father he's a winner.

258
00:18:14,816 --> 00:18:16,191
See?

259
00:18:25,444 --> 00:18:28,705
- Hey! Our first day at home together.
- Hey.

260
00:18:29,188 --> 00:18:31,197
Let's have a big family breakfast.

261
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:33,470
Oh, gosh, honey,
Billy's already gone to school...

262
00:18:33,638 --> 00:18:36,224
...and I gotta meet him for that
Mommy & Me lunch thing.

263
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:38,847
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna look for a job?

264
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:42,562
You know what,
I think I might just take this day.

265
00:18:42,728 --> 00:18:45,379
Great. I do. I think you should.

266
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:48,360
But, listen, I gotta go pick up
that thing at the thing.

267
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:52,041
Baby, I gotta go. I'm sorry. Sorry.

268
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:53,578
Okay, good.

269
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:56,486
I'll see you later, baby.
Have a really good time.

270
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:57,897
Bye.

271
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,322
Okay.

272
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:49,083
Cheers.

273
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:51,446
Former CFO Frank Bascombe
has been indicted...

274
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:54,231
...on charges of fraud
and money laundering,

275
00:19:54,397 --> 00:19:57,180
Lead investigators say all roads
lead to Mr, Bascombe,

276
00:19:57,343 --> 00:19:58,554
And no evidence has yet...

277
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:02,266
...to link former CEO Jack McAllister
to this growing scandal,

278
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,109
We've all had to make sacrifices,

279
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:09,115
I sold my place in Jackson Ho--
No,

280
00:20:09,282 --> 00:20:11,966
- Martha 's Vineyard,
- Oh, shut up!

281
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:15,808
God.

282
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:22,720
Hey, bud. Hey, hey, hey.
Can't be that bad, can it, bud?

283
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:33,256
God!

284
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:37,667
Oh, you know it.

285
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:41,129
So can I send you a résumé?

286
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:44,169
No, I got a terrific one here.
You'll love it.

287
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:46,154
Do you have a fax number?

288
00:20:47,468 --> 00:20:51,464
So there are no new openings
at this time. Right.

289
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,736
And what about the near future?

290
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:58,821
Yeah. Sure. I could stop calling.

291
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:00,458
This afternoon. Okay.

292
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:03,790
I'll be there. Bye.

293
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:09,513
Hon. I got an interview
at Pyramid Tech.

294
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:13,613
I was really starting
to wonder there.

295
00:21:30,681 --> 00:21:31,860
Hey!

296
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,330
Hold on!

297
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,004
- Dick.
- Oz.

298
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:45,739
Wanna go get a drink?

299
00:22:45,903 --> 00:22:48,043
- You buying?
- Sure.

300
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:50,506
- Harper?
- Yeah.

301
00:22:50,832 --> 00:22:52,905
- Dick Harper!
- Yeah.

302
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:57,002
You don't have to stand in this line.
Come on with me.

303
00:22:58,195 --> 00:23:00,235
Hey, Oz. Rain check.

304
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:02,800
Son of a bitch!

305
00:23:04,788 --> 00:23:06,796
Okay, rip it out. Get it on the truck.

306
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:09,941
Hector, what's going on? What--?

307
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:12,405
- What happened?
- Your check go bouncy-bounce.

308
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,186
But it's okay, I heard what happened
to your husband.

309
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:17,686
Not everybody could afford
landscaping like this, eh?

310
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:20,915
- Hector, please.
- I am sorry, Miss Jane.

311
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:25,392
Oh, no, no, no. No! No, no!

312
00:23:25,627 --> 00:23:28,628
This is all--
Everything, it's all wrong.

313
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:30,683
I want this out. Roll it all up.

314
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:33,780
I ordered Kentucky bluegrass.

315
00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:36,568
This is green.

316
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,474
- Dick Harper! What a stroke of luck.
- Oh, jeez.

317
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:46,333
I'm sorry, I don't remember
where you know me from.

318
00:23:46,496 --> 00:23:48,057
Oh, I don't know you.

319
00:23:48,225 --> 00:23:52,252
I just saw you spaz out MoneyLife.
Oh, my God, that was great.

320
00:23:52,418 --> 00:23:54,491
Hey, some of the fellas would
like to meet you.

321
00:23:54,658 --> 00:23:57,179
- Hello, Dick.
- I can't believe it's really you.

322
00:23:57,348 --> 00:24:00,731
- Oh, my God, it's him.
- Did you bring your statistics?

323
00:24:01,861 --> 00:24:04,677
We have an expression around
here when someone makes a mistake.

324
00:24:04,838 --> 00:24:06,399
It's called "pulling a Dick."

325
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:07,876
Up high, up high.

326
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,339
Have you seen
DickHarperIsATool. com?

327
00:24:10,503 --> 00:24:12,512
Oh, you're gonna love this.
This is dynamite.

328
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,779
I don't know where
you're getting your statistics,

329
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:19,785
Who is that? Who is that?
It's you! It's you!

330
00:24:19,946 --> 00:24:22,281
Can we just get on
with the job interview?

331
00:24:22,443 --> 00:24:23,555
This guy!

332
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:27,073
We couldn't hire you!
We just wanna take your picture.

333
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:30,594
Okay, everybody, little bit closer.
One, two, three.

334
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:31,846
Statistics!

335
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,079
Hey, how'd it go?

336
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:41,005
Oh, not too bad.

337
00:24:41,936 --> 00:24:43,628
It was good practice.

338
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:48,296
- What are you doing?
- Going through our finances.

339
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:49,579
I'm not sure...

340
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:53,195
...but it seems that we may be
in a little bit of a pickle, Dick.

341
00:24:53,364 --> 00:24:57,162
Well, sure, our financial bounce-back
has taken a bit longer than expected...

342
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,570
...but, you know, that's natural.

343
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:03,150
Our lawn was repossessed today.
I didn't even know they could do that.

344
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:07,598
I think maybe it's time you start
thinking about accepting something...

345
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:10,071
...a little bit lower
than a vice-presidency.

346
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:13,200
No. Took me 1 5 years to get
a VP-ship. If I step back now...

347
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,963
...I'll lose everything I worked for.

348
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,585
We're just gonna have to suck it up
for a couple months.

349
00:25:17,754 --> 00:25:20,505
In a couple of months,
we'll be declaring bankruptcy.

350
00:25:20,668 --> 00:25:23,287
- Oh, come on.
- Our savings--

351
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:26,966
Look. Our savings
was in Globodyne stock.

352
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:30,549
Jesus. And, look, our pension
was in Globodyne stock.

353
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:34,167
Everything was in Globodyne stock!
All of it!

354
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,849
The lawn is covered with dirt!
It is so much fun!

355
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:40,089
I have made a mud man!

356
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:43,677
Now, Billy is looking
at the glass half full.

357
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:47,681
Hon, relax. We've got 600 grand.

358
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,907
- Where?
- We're standing in it. Our house.

359
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:55,870
Since Globodyne, the local
property market crashed, Dick.

360
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:01,604
If we sold our house today,
we would owe the bank 1 50 grand.

361
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,374
I knew it. It was churning in my gut...

362
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:08,479
- ... and I didn't listen.
- It would be okay.

363
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:11,846
You said we could afford this house
and take out a second mortgage...

364
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:14,401
...so that we could put in the pool,
redo the kitchen...

365
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:16,644
- I said that.
- ... and now we are on the verge...

366
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:18,885
...of losing the house.
If we lose the house...

367
00:26:19,052 --> 00:26:23,177
...then Billy loses all sense of security
and later, never have a relationship...

368
00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:25,415
...so he'll just spend his whole life
just alone.

369
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:28,845
There he'll be, just alone,
nobody with him, just like a bum.

370
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:31,975
Hon? Hon? You need a paper bag?

371
00:26:32,977 --> 00:26:35,247
You said everything
was gonna be okay.

372
00:26:39,986 --> 00:26:44,395
Mr. Dick! Something wrong
with the electricity!

373
00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:49,806
Well, if you're gonna do it,
be the best.

374
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:58,000
Hi, I'm Lucy, and I'll be your Kostmart
training team leader.

375
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,339
I am so happy to welcome you
to the Kostmart team.

376
00:27:00,504 --> 00:27:02,480
Now, we work hard here,
but we play hard also.

377
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:04,504
I think we're
gonna have a good time here...

378
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:07,928
...because at Kostmart,
we're more than a store. We're family.

379
00:27:08,923 --> 00:27:10,680
Now, before we get started...

380
00:27:10,844 --> 00:27:13,266
...I am gonna need you all
to piss in one of these cups.

381
00:27:23,103 --> 00:27:26,748
- It's taking a little while.
- Just relax.

382
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:29,848
I've been married for 20 years.
I know what it looks like.

383
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,416
You want me to get you a cola?

384
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:35,902
It's just hard to do
while you're standing there watching.

385
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:38,751
I could sell you my pee for $1 00.

386
00:27:38,915 --> 00:27:41,786
I been off the pipe for two years.
Thank you, Jesus.

387
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:47,076
Unfortunately, we don't have any
positions available in Pilates or yoga.

388
00:27:47,493 --> 00:27:50,723
But we are looking
for a Jeet Kun Do instructor.

389
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:53,986
Yes. I mean, that's-- Oh, my--
I thought--

390
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:56,487
I didn't even-- I didn't say that?

391
00:27:56,649 --> 00:27:58,787
I was born doing...

392
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:00,775
...that.

393
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:03,936
- Hi, welcome to Kostmart.
- Watch.

394
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:06,245
Hi! Welcome to Kostmart.

395
00:28:06,411 --> 00:28:09,958
Check out our makeup counter
on aisle 1 2B.

396
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:15,112
Welcome to Kostmart. Check out our
CDs. Garth Brooks on sale, aisle 51.

397
00:28:19,055 --> 00:28:22,602
Welcome to Kostmart.
Your local gun emporium.

398
00:28:22,832 --> 00:28:25,069
Aisle 42, hunting gear.

399
00:28:25,713 --> 00:28:27,600
And the next thing I knew,
I was wearing it.

400
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:31,149
- Well, Jane.
- Hey, Veronica.

401
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:33,682
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, good.

402
00:28:33,843 --> 00:28:35,250
I didn't know
you worked out here.

403
00:28:35,411 --> 00:28:39,187
Welcome to Kostmart. I hope
you'll take a trip by the deli today...

404
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:41,388
...for a complimentary cube
of jalapeño cheddar.

405
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:45,006
I'm lactose intolerant.
Where do you keep the cigarettes?

406
00:28:45,175 --> 00:28:47,063
Behind the counter.

407
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:50,127
- But I'm not sure that's a good--
- Dick? You missed one.

408
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,606
I'll get it. I'll get it.
Wait. Ma'am? Ma'am. Welcome!

409
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:57,843
Here we go. Hi. Hi.

410
00:28:59,162 --> 00:29:05,044
My name's Jane, and I'll be your
instructor for beginners' Jin Ku Pow.

411
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:08,344
So let's just get right into it.
Here we go.

412
00:29:10,366 --> 00:29:12,254
We're just gonna loosen up
a little bit.

413
00:29:12,414 --> 00:29:16,540
Here we go. Yeah.
There we go. And ho. And hit.

414
00:29:16,703 --> 00:29:19,486
Excuse me! Ma'am!

415
00:29:24,353 --> 00:29:25,882
And jab. And jab.

416
00:29:29,443 --> 00:29:31,331
- Now I gotcha!
- Get this!

417
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:36,000
It's punch. And punch.
And step. And kick!

418
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,919
- It burns.
- I saw you eyeballing me...

419
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:44,192
...when I came in.
You were all up in my goodies.

420
00:29:48,424 --> 00:29:50,914
You know something?
I'm glad you fired me.

421
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:55,360
How's a person supposed to survive
and feed their family on that salary?

422
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:01,804
It's a lease.

423
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:11,053
I don't know why we didn't think
of this before. It's such a good idea.

424
00:30:11,215 --> 00:30:13,518
We're sorry we couldn't pay you.
We have no money.

425
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:16,169
It's okay. Your son
is very important to me.

426
00:30:16,337 --> 00:30:19,021
I would do anything for him,
Mr. Richard.

427
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:22,896
In the meantime, thank you
for letting us pay you in appliances.

428
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:24,007
Yeah.

429
00:30:26,068 --> 00:30:27,595
Congratulations.

430
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,893
Hey, think about this:

431
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:34,095
How many places you'll see
on one tank of gas.

432
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,574
- You want me to drive?
- Yeah.

433
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,004
Here it is!

434
00:31:04,255 --> 00:31:07,638
We can live without it. People
have lived without these things.

435
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:10,743
- There goes the boxing match.
- You can go to a bar.

436
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:12,440
It's rigged anyway.

437
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:16,283
What are you doing
with the television?

438
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:24,155
- You're going to sell it!
- No, no. Billy!

439
00:31:24,324 --> 00:31:25,470
God! Just go, Dick!

440
00:31:25,637 --> 00:31:27,612
Damn it, Blanca, grab him!

441
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:30,947
- Papa! Mama!
- Go! Go, go!

442
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,664
- Don't take my Telemundo!
- Go! Go! Hurry, hurry!

443
00:31:33,831 --> 00:31:36,614
SpongeRoberto SquarePantalones!

444
00:31:36,776 --> 00:31:40,519
- God! Just go, go, go!
- I want my MTV Latino.

445
00:31:49,772 --> 00:31:51,715
Dick, what are we gonna do?

446
00:31:52,748 --> 00:31:55,051
We've run out of things to sell.

447
00:31:57,294 --> 00:31:58,243
Well....

448
00:32:00,495 --> 00:32:03,147
- There's always prostitution.
- Dick.

449
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:05,517
I mean me.

450
00:32:06,064 --> 00:32:08,105
We just gotta look
for more work, that's all.

451
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:12,977
There is no work, Dick. There's
6000 other people out of work.

452
00:32:13,138 --> 00:32:15,146
Vice presidents are working
at Burger King.

453
00:32:15,315 --> 00:32:18,186
It's gonna be fine.
All we need is $400...

454
00:32:18,356 --> 00:32:22,099
...and we're good for another month.
This is just temporary. So stay calm.

455
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:24,203
- And don't panic!
- Damn.

456
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,547
Are you going to sit in the dirt hole
all night long?

457
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:38,135
- Come on, hon, let's get out.
- Yeah.

458
00:32:38,298 --> 00:32:40,437
I'm starting to turn
into a raisin anyway.

459
00:32:41,338 --> 00:32:44,056
What's the matter?
You look sad, Richard.

460
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,777
Blanca, call me Dick.

461
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:50,455
Well, Blanca,
there's just no jobs out there.

462
00:32:52,733 --> 00:32:56,696
I have a cousin who might be able
to help you find some work.

463
00:32:56,863 --> 00:32:59,514
It's not much. But it's something.

464
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:21,693
I need one guy
who knows how to paint.

465
00:33:21,863 --> 00:33:23,041
That's me!

466
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,915
Hold on, I got it. I got it. I'm here!

467
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,672
Hey, I was here first!

468
00:33:34,026 --> 00:33:36,842
Congratulations, güero.
You almost got that one.

469
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:42,090
Don't worry. There'll be more.

470
00:33:43,437 --> 00:33:46,253
That thing is already starting
to swell up like a balloon.

471
00:33:46,414 --> 00:33:47,461
Is it noticeable?

472
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,060
- No.
- Just a little bit.

473
00:33:49,231 --> 00:33:52,231
Did you see that?
We should report that guy.

474
00:33:54,544 --> 00:33:55,973
Report him!

475
00:33:56,561 --> 00:33:58,634
- We should report him.
- Let's report him.

476
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:00,143
I do it for you.

477
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:03,632
This is a new drug
in the same family of Botox.

478
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:05,584
We don't expect any problems.

479
00:34:05,747 --> 00:34:08,465
Your check for $1 4 is waiting for you
at the front desk...

480
00:34:08,628 --> 00:34:13,266
...and we think you are all
going to look beautiful. Okay.

481
00:34:13,973 --> 00:34:16,308
Now, if you can begin
by just filling out those forms.

482
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:18,380
Those are insurance waivers.

483
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:22,676
And then you'll find a list
of various aspects of your face.

484
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,880
Go ahead and check off
anything that you think...

485
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:27,384
...you might want to improve on
just a little bit.

486
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,991
Are deuces still wild?

487
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:34,132
No.

488
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,216
I'm screwed.

489
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:42,937
Well, I think I'm gonna go, guys.
Carlos. Eduardo. Gustavo.

490
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:46,423
Pleasure talking to you
the last couple hours.

491
00:34:46,591 --> 00:34:48,795
Hey, congratulations
on the baby too.

492
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:52,126
- INS!
- All right, hold it right there.

493
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:54,428
- INS?
- Hold it right there.

494
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:56,383
You're not going anywhere.

495
00:34:56,546 --> 00:34:58,521
- Hold it right there!
- You've gotta be kidding.

496
00:34:58,691 --> 00:34:59,738
Oh, this is hilarious.

497
00:34:59,907 --> 00:35:01,947
You guys know the drill.
Let's see some papers.

498
00:35:02,116 --> 00:35:03,545
- Against the wall.
- Papers.

499
00:35:03,716 --> 00:35:06,716
Where's my wallet?
Where'd my wallet go? This is--

500
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:09,635
- No, no. I dropped my wallet.
- Back up.

501
00:35:09,797 --> 00:35:11,773
- Oh, these are doozies.
- What do you got?

502
00:35:11,942 --> 00:35:16,166
We got a Don Johnson,
Elvis and Opie Taylor.

503
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:18,532
- Dick Harper, you're free to go.
- Dick Harper?

504
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:22,659
That's me, Dick Harper. Hey, that
guy's not Dick Harper! Whoa, jeez!

505
00:35:22,825 --> 00:35:23,905
We don't want problems.

506
00:35:24,074 --> 00:35:27,075
You're making a serious mistake
in judgment. I am an American.

507
00:35:27,243 --> 00:35:28,934
You gotta work on
your accent, Pablo.

508
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:30,954
Could we--? You wanna talk
to my wife, Jane?

509
00:35:31,115 --> 00:35:33,288
Yeah. Oh, okay, yeah.
We'll call your wife, "Yane."

510
00:35:33,452 --> 00:35:36,552
We'll ask her if you're American.
And we'll call my wife, Yennifer...

511
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,435
- ... and his wife, Yaqueline, too.
- It's ringing, it's ringing!

512
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,905
No, wait! I'm an American!
I swear to God!

513
00:35:49,073 --> 00:35:51,016
- Hey, watch your language.
- Get in there.

514
00:35:51,186 --> 00:35:53,488
Okay, we have our results.

515
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:58,124
Negative side effects with only
three of 1 4 participants in the study.

516
00:35:58,293 --> 00:36:00,944
- That's not bad. Let's see, now.
- Hello?

517
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:03,314
- Jill? Hi, Jill.
- Dick, what--?

518
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:05,518
Oh, honey, I can barely under--

519
00:36:05,686 --> 00:36:08,142
What--? Why are you doing
that accent?

520
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:19,044
Holy hell!

521
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:21,190
I did this little cosmetics test...

522
00:37:21,355 --> 00:37:25,034
...and I had a little reaction.
Is it really that bad?

523
00:37:25,197 --> 00:37:28,875
No, it's not so bad.
It's just different.

524
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,079
Dick, can we talk about this
some other time?

525
00:37:31,246 --> 00:37:33,254
Oh, yeah. Come on, come on.
Go, go, go, go!

526
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:55,631
I gotta go in. I gotta go to bed.

527
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:59,089
You coming?

528
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,465
I think I'm gonna sit in the car...

529
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,173
...and think for a while.

530
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,640
Okay.

531
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:18,867
Don't think for too long,
we gotta get up early.

532
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,070
Soup kitchens stop serving at 8.

533
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:51,839
You're still pretty.

534
00:40:00,921 --> 00:40:02,832
I'm not playing anymore.

535
00:40:03,003 --> 00:40:05,142
I've just about had it!

536
00:40:13,885 --> 00:40:15,063
Sorry.

537
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:25,280
O my God, I'm heartily sorry
for having offended thee.

538
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:28,224
It's okay. I'm putting it back.

539
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:31,104
I'm putting it back! It's okay.

540
00:41:00,715 --> 00:41:04,132
Hon, what happened?

541
00:41:06,509 --> 00:41:08,451
I got the lawn back.

542
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:10,476
Got the... ?

543
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:22,641
Oh, Dick.

544
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:24,615
It's beautiful.

545
00:41:26,355 --> 00:41:27,882
Honey.

546
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:34,668
Oh, Dick, I love you.

547
00:41:34,837 --> 00:41:36,692
I love you.

548
00:42:48,906 --> 00:42:50,216
Are these too big for my face?

549
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,119
Well, now you look like
the Unabomber.

550
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,546
Good.

551
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,751
What are you doing
with Billy's squirt gun?

552
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:07,246
We followed the rules
and we got screwed.

553
00:43:07,407 --> 00:43:09,645
We were good people,
honest people...

554
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:11,948
...and we got screwed.

555
00:43:12,337 --> 00:43:13,864
Damn it!

556
00:43:15,537 --> 00:43:17,872
What are you gonna do now,
you gonna rob a bank?

557
00:43:18,034 --> 00:43:20,556
We got screwed.
Over and over again, hon.

558
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:22,896
I stole the lawn back,
and you know what happened?

559
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,751
We have a lawn now.

560
00:43:25,044 --> 00:43:27,664
Yeah, but-- Okay.

561
00:43:28,662 --> 00:43:30,092
We're all just cavemen...

562
00:43:30,262 --> 00:43:32,980
...trying to protect
our little patch of land.

563
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:34,834
Well, now I have a club...

564
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,553
...and I'm gonna take what I need.

565
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:40,534
Maybe you should steal
some Prozac.

566
00:43:41,977 --> 00:43:44,945
Keep laughing, Jane.
Keep laughing, okay?

567
00:43:45,115 --> 00:43:46,424
I'll be back soon...

568
00:43:46,587 --> 00:43:49,435
- ... with the loot.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm coming.

569
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:51,768
- Not gonna miss this for the world.
- Suit yourself.

570
00:43:51,932 --> 00:43:54,933
Besides, you're gonna need
a good wheelman.

571
00:44:03,616 --> 00:44:05,526
Okay, that's it, joke's over.
Let's go home.

572
00:44:05,696 --> 00:44:06,941
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

573
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:09,277
- We haven't done the caper yet.
- Wow, okay, you--

574
00:44:09,442 --> 00:44:11,744
Then-- Then let's do it before,
you know...

575
00:44:11,906 --> 00:44:13,663
...we die of
carbon-monoxide poisoning.

576
00:44:13,827 --> 00:44:15,616
When you're in there,
get me some Sno-Caps.

577
00:44:16,068 --> 00:44:18,403
Oh, no, no, no, Raisinets,
Raisinets. I want Raisinets.

578
00:44:20,517 --> 00:44:22,492
Hon, your thingamabob.

579
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:24,898
- I know, I know.
- All right.

580
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:29,921
And don't forget
to kill the witnesses, hon.

581
00:44:31,112 --> 00:44:32,519
Okay.

582
00:44:43,243 --> 00:44:44,651
Hi.

583
00:45:19,734 --> 00:45:21,490
Brain freeze.

584
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:24,143
You ever get that?

585
00:45:44,381 --> 00:45:49,117
One Brainfreeze. Anything else?

586
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:54,683
Yeah. Yeah, I got something else...

587
00:45:54,848 --> 00:45:56,671
...right here.

588
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:01,306
Hey, Jake, take a break.
I got this one.

589
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:09,695
That'll be 1.29, please.

590
00:46:21,992 --> 00:46:23,847
1.29.

591
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,570
Go! Jane, go! Just go!

592
00:46:41,357 --> 00:46:43,081
Oh, God. You did it?

593
00:46:43,246 --> 00:46:44,676
Oh, there that is.

594
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:47,946
- That was wild. That was wild!
- You actually robbed that place?

595
00:46:48,111 --> 00:46:51,014
No, but I had a slushie
and I didn't even pay for it.

596
00:46:54,641 --> 00:46:57,609
- What?
- Well, then our problems...

597
00:46:57,778 --> 00:46:59,404
...are pretty much over.

598
00:46:59,571 --> 00:47:03,402
Jane, just drive the car, okay?
We'll find another place, okay?

599
00:47:09,974 --> 00:47:12,692
Give me your money!
Garth!

600
00:47:12,855 --> 00:47:14,229
Dick?

601
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:17,653
- Oh, my God.
- You remember Jane.

602
00:47:17,816 --> 00:47:19,671
- She's in the car.
- Jane?

603
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:21,142
- Hi, Garth.
- Hey, Jane.

604
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,510
- Hon, it's-- Garth.
- What's with this?

605
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:27,352
- From the barbeque.
- Harper, what are you--?

606
00:47:27,515 --> 00:47:29,042
I had you going there.

607
00:47:29,211 --> 00:47:30,935
Had me going?
You scared me to death.

608
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:32,563
- Yeah, well....
- You're a madman.

609
00:47:32,732 --> 00:47:34,555
- We should hang out soon.
- All right.

610
00:47:34,716 --> 00:47:36,986
Yeah, you wanna hang out
with Garth soon, hon?

611
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:38,524
- All right.
- All right.

612
00:47:38,686 --> 00:47:41,305
Drive. Just drive. Just drive the car.

613
00:47:41,472 --> 00:47:43,960
- Okay, Dick.
- Okay.

614
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:55,072
My car's right there.

615
00:47:55,235 --> 00:47:58,584
Get that for you, then. Okay.

616
00:47:58,757 --> 00:48:00,797
- Thank you, sonny. Thank you.
- Oh, no, l--

617
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:03,071
Well, maybe.

618
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:07,293
Okay, stop the car.

619
00:48:10,439 --> 00:48:12,709
Now, that place is loaded.

620
00:48:12,872 --> 00:48:14,814
They are ripe for the picking.

621
00:48:14,984 --> 00:48:18,847
And you are just the guy
for the job.

622
00:48:19,017 --> 00:48:21,637
But seriously, doesn't this remind
you of that movie Heat...

623
00:48:21,803 --> 00:48:23,712
- ... with Val Kilmer--?
- I'm trying my best.

624
00:48:23,883 --> 00:48:27,179
There's nothing to be ashamed of,
is all I'm saying. Some people....

625
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:31,051
Some people have that robbing thing
and-- And some people don't.

626
00:48:31,213 --> 00:48:32,620
Maybe...

627
00:48:32,781 --> 00:48:34,757
...you're not a badass.

628
00:48:37,327 --> 00:48:39,302
Hey, man. What can I do you for?

629
00:48:39,472 --> 00:48:41,327
You can do me for
all the money in the till.

630
00:48:41,488 --> 00:48:44,107
- This is a stickup.
- Whoa, what's wrong with you, dude?

631
00:48:44,274 --> 00:48:46,129
I'm married,
that's what's wrong with me.

632
00:48:49,714 --> 00:48:51,570
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

633
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:54,513
Move it, paraquat! Come on, Zig-Zag.

634
00:48:55,284 --> 00:48:57,226
That's a real gun.
You're robbing me.

635
00:48:57,397 --> 00:49:00,080
- Dick?
- Honey, robe.

636
00:49:00,918 --> 00:49:03,253
Oh, God, okay.
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

637
00:49:03,415 --> 00:49:05,968
Listen to me. What are you
doing, are you craz--?

638
00:49:06,135 --> 00:49:08,077
- What?
- Listen, put your hands down.

639
00:49:08,249 --> 00:49:10,518
- He's been stressed.
- Why are you undercutting me?

640
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,852
- To be fair, we both--
- I'm trying to rob this man.

641
00:49:13,018 --> 00:49:16,084
- We don't need to do this.
- I got a call about the mortgage.

642
00:49:16,249 --> 00:49:20,212
If we don't pay tomorrow, the sheriff's
coming to put us out on the street.

643
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,962
Get the money out of
there right now, I mean it!

644
00:49:24,124 --> 00:49:26,743
- Pull it out, put it in a sack! Let's go!
- Easy, hon.

645
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:29,299
- God! Oh, God!
- Come on.

646
00:49:30,749 --> 00:49:33,434
Wow, that's fantastic.
Women are amazing, aren't they?

647
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,909
It's just like jelly jars.

648
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:37,755
Whoa, hon! Hon!

649
00:49:38,305 --> 00:49:40,377
- Look, look.
- Hon?

650
00:49:40,546 --> 00:49:43,328
- What?
- I don't think anybody's following us.

651
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:44,951
God!

652
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:47,614
Oh, look out for that.

653
00:49:55,494 --> 00:49:57,382
Oh, park under there.

654
00:50:07,401 --> 00:50:09,026
Oh, my God.

655
00:50:09,194 --> 00:50:12,675
- I can't believe we just did that.
- But we did do it.

656
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,785
We did do it.

657
00:50:28,847 --> 00:50:28,975
It's not like we stole
from some old lady, you know?

658
00:50:28,975 --> 00:50:31,212
It's not like we stole
from some old lady, you know?

659
00:50:31,376 --> 00:50:34,094
Exactly. And you know, maybe
we can figure out a way we can...

660
00:50:34,257 --> 00:50:36,559
...give back some of what
we've taken to other people.

661
00:50:36,722 --> 00:50:38,958
Maybe we will.
It's a definite possibility.

662
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:40,530
Wanna grab a cup of coffee?

663
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:43,178
- Iced mocha sounds nice.
- Yeah.

664
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:47,881
All right, this is a holdup. Get on
the ground and you won't get hurt.

665
00:50:48,052 --> 00:50:49,613
Whoa, Jesus. Are you okay, hon?

666
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:50,959
- I'm okay.
- All right.

667
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:53,395
You. Two iced mochas, let's go.
Move it, move it.

668
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:55,250
- Two iced mochas.
- Yeah. Whipped cream.

669
00:50:55,415 --> 00:50:57,487
- Whipped cream.
- Any whipped cream, hon, on yours?

670
00:50:57,656 --> 00:50:58,834
- No, thanks.
- None on hers.

671
00:50:58,999 --> 00:51:01,870
- No whipped cream.
- Are these nonfat muffins?

672
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:03,797
- Are they nonfat muffins? !
- I think so.

673
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:06,679
Okay. Hon, these are nonfat
muffins. Get some of those.

674
00:51:06,842 --> 00:51:09,493
- Which ones, vanilla or chocolate?
- In the back, in the back.

675
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:10,837
- This one?
- No, no, that one.

676
00:51:11,003 --> 00:51:12,598
- Front? Honey!
- No, that one. Okay.

677
00:51:12,764 --> 00:51:15,318
Yeah, okay, that's good.
Okay, nobody try to follow us...

678
00:51:15,485 --> 00:51:17,907
...because we're desperate criminals.
We're crazy people!

679
00:51:18,077 --> 00:51:20,282
And I'll kill you all!

680
00:51:20,446 --> 00:51:23,130
- Oh, hon, the coffee. Coffee.
- Oh, yeah, right.

681
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:26,014
Thanks a lot.

682
00:51:30,336 --> 00:51:32,093
What are you doing in there?

683
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:33,851
What do you think?

684
00:51:34,722 --> 00:51:38,300
- It's Elvis on a motorcycle?
- It's Evel Knievel, hon.

685
00:51:38,467 --> 00:51:40,540
I like the way it makes my butt look.

686
00:52:19,567 --> 00:52:22,089
Honey, where's my car?

687
00:52:33,139 --> 00:52:34,962
Mercedes, off.

688
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:46,164
Now I can watch soccer!

689
00:52:46,327 --> 00:52:49,677
No matter what happens,
know that I love you.

690
00:52:49,848 --> 00:52:51,539
I love you too.

691
00:52:51,704 --> 00:52:53,363
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

692
00:52:53,529 --> 00:52:56,344
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!

693
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:10,263
Oh, my God.

694
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,147
This guy's really loaded.

695
00:53:14,847 --> 00:53:17,237
That's a lot of lettuce.

696
00:53:18,913 --> 00:53:20,953
Should we pistol-whip him?

697
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:28,473
Hey, don't laugh.

698
00:53:28,643 --> 00:53:30,104
Don't you laugh now, okay?

699
00:53:30,596 --> 00:53:32,604
Because it demeans
what we're doing here.

700
00:53:32,772 --> 00:53:34,333
Yeah.

701
00:53:38,534 --> 00:53:40,290
- Anyway, shall we?
- Let's do it.

702
00:53:40,455 --> 00:53:42,048
- What--? What is that?
- Nothing.

703
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:44,835
Don't do anything funny, or else.

704
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,198
You could pay the ultimate price.

705
00:54:16,176 --> 00:54:18,829
Honey, come on, cut the crap.

706
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:21,479
Okay.

707
00:54:25,523 --> 00:54:27,378
We sound so funny.

708
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:30,224
I know. That's what I was thinking.

709
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:32,686
Oh, my God.

710
00:54:34,613 --> 00:54:35,662
Hel--

711
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:51,567
Did you guys hear what happened
to Bob Blaustein?

712
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,365
- Bob Blaustein?
- Yeah.

713
00:54:53,532 --> 00:54:56,467
- Who's Bob Blaustein?
- Oh, he works at Sonent Global.

714
00:54:56,636 --> 00:54:59,124
Or should I say he worked
at Sonent Global.

715
00:54:59,293 --> 00:55:01,715
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and if they're not careful...

716
00:55:01,886 --> 00:55:03,642
...they'll become
the next Pyramid Tech.

717
00:55:03,806 --> 00:55:06,196
Absolutely. Absolutely.

718
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:07,894
Oh, Dick...

719
00:55:08,063 --> 00:55:10,169
...what you been up to since
Globodyne went under?

720
00:55:10,336 --> 00:55:13,118
Just working at home,
playing in the stock market.

721
00:55:13,281 --> 00:55:15,005
I tell you, guys...

722
00:55:15,682 --> 00:55:18,717
- ... it's like stealing money.
- You're on fire, Dick.

723
00:55:24,644 --> 00:55:27,580
- Last job, try to stay focused.
- Okay.

724
00:55:28,645 --> 00:55:31,135
- Let me hold that door for you, ma'am.
- Why, thank you.

725
00:55:31,302 --> 00:55:32,829
You're welcome.

726
00:55:34,567 --> 00:55:36,804
Oh, my goodness.
This woman has fainted.

727
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,655
- Are you all right?
- You might wanna open her blouse...

728
00:55:39,817 --> 00:55:40,995
...so she can...

729
00:55:41,161 --> 00:55:42,536
- ... breathe.
- Right.

730
00:55:42,698 --> 00:55:45,415
- Oh, no, no, no, no, l--
- You okay?

731
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,147
Oh, no.

732
00:55:52,588 --> 00:55:53,570
That's good.

733
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:56,292
- Let me get back to you. Excuse me.
- Yes?

734
00:55:56,621 --> 00:55:58,694
- May I help you?
- Vault inspector.

735
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:03,434
- What happened to Phil?
- Necrotizing fasciitis.

736
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,542
Caused by
an invasive streptococcus.

737
00:56:06,192 --> 00:56:07,534
What?

738
00:56:07,696 --> 00:56:09,355
Flesh-eating disorder.

739
00:56:09,522 --> 00:56:11,464
It's all over the money.

740
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,903
Might wanna wash your hands.

741
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:28,148
- Everybody down!
- This is a robbery!

742
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:31,410
- No way!
- Freeze, everybody.

743
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:39,023
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

744
00:56:39,193 --> 00:56:41,615
- Oh, no.
- Nobody move a muscle.

745
00:56:41,787 --> 00:56:44,341
You. Whiskers, whiskers.
On the floor.

746
00:56:44,507 --> 00:56:45,915
Oh, Dick.

747
00:56:46,076 --> 00:56:47,669
I will blow those whiskers...

748
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,363
- ... right off your face!
- I'm down!

749
00:56:49,534 --> 00:56:52,185
- Go get the money, please.
- You're-- You're money, I'm guns...

750
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:54,969
- ... that's the plan.
- Put your weapons down.

751
00:56:55,135 --> 00:56:57,175
- Oh, shit.
- Stick to the plan, stick to the plan.

752
00:56:57,344 --> 00:57:00,791
- I'm putting the weapon down.
- Bring it on, pigs!

753
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,815
- Honey.
- What are you doing?

754
00:57:02,977 --> 00:57:05,367
Oh, Dick. Oh, Dick. Oh, Dick.
Run, Dick, run.

755
00:57:05,537 --> 00:57:07,545
- You coward!
- Stay on the ground.

756
00:57:07,714 --> 00:57:10,136
- Whoa, boy.
- You quitter!

757
00:57:10,307 --> 00:57:13,275
- I'm cuffed! I'm cuffed!
- You filthy pig.

758
00:57:13,444 --> 00:57:15,004
- I'm sorry.
- Bring it on.

759
00:57:15,171 --> 00:57:17,539
- Bring it on, I'll take on all of you!
- Oz?

760
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:20,801
- Hon, get the car! Get the car!
- Debbie.

761
00:57:22,278 --> 00:57:23,687
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, Dick.

762
00:57:23,848 --> 00:57:25,441
Honey.

763
00:57:28,168 --> 00:57:29,892
Oh, thank God.

764
00:57:31,209 --> 00:57:31,337
Oz and Debbie Peterson...

765
00:57:31,337 --> 00:57:32,264
Oz and Debbie Peterson...

766
00:57:32,425 --> 00:57:34,401
... former employees
of now-defunct Globodyne...

767
00:57:34,569 --> 00:57:36,479
... were charged
with armed robbery...

768
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:41,124
- ... after holding up a local branch...
- Dick. Dick, that could have been us.

769
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,568
What were we thinking?

770
00:57:42,733 --> 00:57:46,508
- and turned to crime as a result
of their sudden unemployment,

771
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:50,217
Like this woman, Naomi Seiler,
a human-resources manager...

772
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:53,417
... caught last May managing
a different kind of resource:

773
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:57,130
220 kilos of Canada 's
finest marijuana,

774
00:57:57,489 --> 00:58:01,287
I knew her. She always remembered
everybody's birthday.

775
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:05,036
Or this man, Mark Fish,
a former VP of Globodyne, , ,

776
00:58:05,202 --> 00:58:07,658
... who was arrested after using
his home as the setting...

777
00:58:07,826 --> 00:58:09,715
... for secret high-stakes cockfights,

778
00:58:09,876 --> 00:58:13,293
Mark Fish? He was such a nice guy.

779
00:58:13,461 --> 00:58:15,218
Globodyne CFO
Frank Bascombe...

780
00:58:15,382 --> 00:58:18,383
...starts serving his 18-month
prison term next week,

781
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:21,366
- Eighteen months? That's nothing.
- Bastard.

782
00:58:21,527 --> 00:58:23,568
- -trying to incriminate
Jack McAllister,

783
00:58:23,737 --> 00:58:26,770
- Oh, yeah.
- I don't think I got away with anything,

784
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:29,839
The collapse of Globodyne
hurt me financially and personally...

785
00:58:30,011 --> 00:58:33,808
... just like any other employee,
I'm sick about it,

786
00:58:34,683 --> 00:58:36,593
I'm et up about it,

787
00:58:38,301 --> 00:58:40,407
Now watch this shot,

788
00:58:44,094 --> 00:58:45,720
Did I get him?

789
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:47,705
- Now you did,
- Great,

790
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:49,246
Look at that guy.

791
00:58:49,408 --> 00:58:52,954
Everybody's in hell,
he's on vacation shooting stuff.

792
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:56,471
Man, I hope every one of these
bastards get what they deserve.

793
00:58:56,642 --> 00:58:58,552
Prosecutors say next
to be indicted will be...

794
00:58:58,722 --> 00:59:00,762
... company spin doctor Dick Harper,

795
00:59:01,155 --> 00:59:03,489
- Harper gave misleading statements...
- What? Indicted?

796
00:59:03,652 --> 00:59:06,336
... about Globodyne's finances
one minute before the company...

797
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:08,705
- Indicted?
- That's not fair. They made you...

798
00:59:08,869 --> 00:59:10,593
...go on that show.

799
00:59:10,758 --> 00:59:12,929
You hear what they said?
I'm gonna be indicted.

800
00:59:13,095 --> 00:59:15,429
- But you only said what they told you.
- Indicted, Jane!

801
00:59:15,592 --> 00:59:18,113
Indicted. I'm gonna be indicted.

802
00:59:18,279 --> 00:59:19,774
- Wait, it's gonna be--
- Indicted!

803
00:59:19,945 --> 00:59:21,701
- Honey-- Dick--
- Indicted!

804
00:59:21,865 --> 00:59:23,043
- Honey--
- Gonna be indicted!

805
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:26,058
Hold it, they can't--
It's gonna be okay. Just calm down.

806
00:59:26,218 --> 00:59:29,896
I can't calm down,
I'm gonna be indicted. Indicted!

807
00:59:30,604 --> 00:59:32,842
I'm gonna be indicted!

808
00:59:33,292 --> 00:59:35,235
Indicted!

809
00:59:36,462 --> 00:59:38,763
I'm gonna be indicted!

810
00:59:38,926 --> 00:59:40,781
Be indicted!

811
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:52,206
You know, I haven't seen you
in the downtown club for a while, sir.

812
00:59:53,362 --> 00:59:56,975
Well, that's because
I was very, very busy...

813
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,442
...being indicted.

814
01:00:13,752 --> 01:00:17,014
Look at all the executives.

815
01:00:18,777 --> 01:00:23,219
You guys are my kind of peeps.

816
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:26,999
Captains of industry,
masters of the universe...

817
01:00:27,164 --> 01:00:31,289
...presidents of Hair Club for Men.
That's a nice piece of hair.

818
01:00:31,453 --> 01:00:34,105
You can't even see the tread marks.

819
01:00:34,878 --> 01:00:38,261
This squirrel died of natural causes.

820
01:00:39,392 --> 01:00:42,011
Excuse me, pardon me.

821
01:00:42,912 --> 01:00:49,057
I gotta get to the "toppytip"
of the financial summit.

822
01:00:49,218 --> 01:00:51,226
Isn't anyone going to do anything?

823
01:00:51,395 --> 01:00:54,625
This happens every week.
This guy actually isn't that bad.

824
01:00:58,502 --> 01:01:00,411
I'm a corporate puppet.

825
01:01:01,126 --> 01:01:03,778
And I'm gonna need
some more string...

826
01:01:03,943 --> 01:01:07,107
...so I can go on believing
I'll be a real boy someday...

827
01:01:07,271 --> 01:01:09,858
- ... without being manipulated...
- No, no, no, I got it.

828
01:01:10,025 --> 01:01:11,781
...by the bullshit!

829
01:01:11,945 --> 01:01:14,182
Oh, my God, Dick.
Come down from there.

830
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:22,370
Hon, I'm in the middle
of a very important meeting.

831
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:25,923
Sweetie, you're standing on a table
pretending to be a puppet.

832
01:01:26,093 --> 01:01:27,818
Who's pretending?

833
01:01:30,543 --> 01:01:33,510
- Couldn't you have just cut him off?
- He only had half a beer.

834
01:01:40,913 --> 01:01:43,783
Dick, hi. Long time no see.

835
01:01:46,034 --> 01:01:50,291
- Frank! Frank!
- I'm gonna get him. Just--

836
01:01:52,373 --> 01:01:55,855
Frank, where are you going?

837
01:01:56,214 --> 01:01:59,630
- Dick!
- Come on, Frank.

838
01:01:59,798 --> 01:02:03,280
I just wanna have a talk.

839
01:02:04,248 --> 01:02:05,591
Hey there, Frankie.

840
01:02:05,752 --> 01:02:08,982
How do you like those
eggs Florentine?

841
01:02:09,145 --> 01:02:12,146
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, it was Jack.

842
01:02:12,314 --> 01:02:13,591
It was Jack.

843
01:02:13,755 --> 01:02:16,309
He siphoned off
all of Globodyne's assets...

844
01:02:16,475 --> 01:02:19,738
...and then he dumped the stock.
It was his plan from the beginning.

845
01:02:19,932 --> 01:02:21,842
Son of a bitch!

846
01:02:22,141 --> 01:02:23,603
That fucker!

847
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:26,708
- Hon, language.
- She's right.

848
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,252
When you get out of prison...

849
01:02:28,414 --> 01:02:30,520
...you'll get $20 million
to keep your mouth shut.

850
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:33,469
No, 1 0. You think
I could have gotten 20?

851
01:02:33,856 --> 01:02:35,351
You son of a b--

852
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:37,660
- You'll break-- Dick.
- I want him.

853
01:02:37,825 --> 01:02:40,444
- Let go.
- Don't you think I feel terrible?

854
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:42,814
Why do you think I'm drinking
myself to death?

855
01:02:42,978 --> 01:02:46,275
Instead of drinking, why don't
you do something about it.

856
01:02:46,436 --> 01:02:50,015
Yeah, Frank. Sometimes the cure
is a clean conscience.

857
01:02:51,654 --> 01:02:54,949
- That is good.
- Thanks, hon.

858
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,933
- I just thought of it.
- You did?

859
01:02:57,095 --> 01:02:58,918
- Yeah.
- You're right.

860
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,990
You're right. Help me up.
Help me up.

861
01:03:01,161 --> 01:03:04,129
Yeah, help me up.
I gotta think of something.

862
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,530
Okay, just give me a minute.
Just give me--

863
01:03:06,698 --> 01:03:08,521
Hey.

864
01:03:08,683 --> 01:03:10,276
Hey!

865
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:17,802
- Not this time, Frank.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

866
01:03:17,966 --> 01:03:21,861
It's force of habit.
I know a way. I know a way.

867
01:03:23,183 --> 01:03:26,729
But it's really, really risky.

868
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:29,194
That's where Jack keeps it.

869
01:03:29,361 --> 01:03:32,461
Four hundred million in
highly liquid U.S. bearer bonds.

870
01:03:32,626 --> 01:03:36,204
So it's a vault job. Go in after
midnight, bypass security...

871
01:03:36,371 --> 01:03:38,346
...and... power tools.

872
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,620
- It's a little simpler than that.
- Power tools?

873
01:03:42,164 --> 01:03:45,394
Jack's gonna have to take those
bonds out of the safe-deposit box,

874
01:03:45,557 --> 01:03:46,899
That should be fun for him,

875
01:03:47,061 --> 01:03:48,271
Here's my babies.

876
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:50,860
So, what's he gonna do
with the money?

877
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:53,364
There it is,
the Grand Cayman Bank.

878
01:03:53,527 --> 01:03:55,088
Grand Cayman. What is this place?

879
01:03:55,288 --> 01:03:57,329
It's where rich people
go to evade taxes,

880
01:03:57,497 --> 01:03:58,904
- Bastards,
- Honey,

881
01:03:59,065 --> 01:04:01,335
They can't hear us, What's next?

882
01:04:01,785 --> 01:04:03,990
McAllister takes the bonds
to a representative...

883
01:04:04,154 --> 01:04:07,221
... who asks him for his signature
to verify what they call "membership, "

884
01:04:07,387 --> 01:04:09,176
Once the bonds are counted
and confirmed...

885
01:04:09,341 --> 01:04:12,188
... McAllister will receive
a CRM-114 deposit form...

886
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,684
... and on this form
he inputs his account number...

887
01:04:14,846 --> 01:04:17,782
... that only he and the bank know,
Then the agent will take this...

888
01:04:17,951 --> 01:04:20,340
...to an authorization officer
for further verification.

889
01:04:20,512 --> 01:04:23,381
Once the representative has stamped
and initialed the document...

890
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,886
... the account rep will take
the CRM- 1 14...

891
01:04:26,049 --> 01:04:29,595
... back to McAllister for final
approval before finalization,

892
01:04:29,763 --> 01:04:31,519
You said this was
gonna be simple.

893
01:04:31,906 --> 01:04:34,362
Can you explain it again?
Jane doesn't seem to understand.

894
01:04:34,532 --> 01:04:37,793
- Jane, it's simple. It's so simple.
- Jeez.

895
01:04:37,955 --> 01:04:39,483
Now, listen.

896
01:04:39,653 --> 01:04:41,727
All we have to do...

897
01:04:42,886 --> 01:04:46,913
... is switch McAllisters CRM-114
with his account number...

898
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:48,486
... with one of our own,

899
01:04:48,647 --> 01:04:50,470
- I'm so sorry.
- A copy that we have made...

900
01:04:50,633 --> 01:04:55,074
...that has a number from an account
that I have established.

901
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:59,333
And Jack sends the 400 million
to us without knowing it.

902
01:04:59,498 --> 01:05:01,321
That's-- You got it. It's so simple.

903
01:05:01,483 --> 01:05:03,524
That is beautiful. It's a switch.

904
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:05,121
- It's a switch,
- It's a switch,

905
01:05:05,293 --> 01:05:06,820
- It's a switch.
- That's so sexy, man.

906
01:05:06,989 --> 01:05:10,088
- That's unbelievable. It'll be fun.
- But Jane's gonna have to do it.

907
01:05:10,253 --> 01:05:13,964
Because if McAllister sees either
one of us, he'll know something's up.

908
01:05:14,127 --> 01:05:17,128
- And l... ?
- Do nothing.

909
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:20,582
I can do that.

910
01:05:22,033 --> 01:05:23,243
Yeah.

911
01:05:23,409 --> 01:05:24,719
Okay.

912
01:05:24,882 --> 01:05:27,185
- You do it, then. You're the one.
- Yeah.

913
01:05:27,347 --> 01:05:28,753
Yeah.

914
01:05:30,964 --> 01:05:32,720
- You could do it, except--
- No, it's good.

915
01:05:32,884 --> 01:05:34,740
No, you do it. You do it. You do it.

916
01:05:34,901 --> 01:05:36,724
- You deserve to do it.
- Honey--

917
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:45,174
Are you ready to make the switch?
Do you have the form?

918
01:05:45,335 --> 01:05:47,856
- It's right here.
- We should practice the move.

919
01:05:48,025 --> 01:05:49,334
- No, I got it.
- Okay, fine.

920
01:05:49,497 --> 01:05:51,701
I won't be involved.
I won't participate at all.

921
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:54,255
- You do it. It's all you.
- Let's do one for good luck.

922
01:05:54,425 --> 01:05:56,728
I got dressed up.
You're not doing me any favors.

923
01:05:56,891 --> 01:05:59,226
- Get out of the car!
- I just think it's important.

924
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:00,949
That's all.

925
01:06:01,341 --> 01:06:05,051
Okay, I'll be the bank representative.
And you be you.

926
01:06:07,486 --> 01:06:09,691
Hey. Hey! Wait, sir.

927
01:06:09,855 --> 01:06:12,343
- No! No, no. No!
- Sorry.

928
01:06:16,512 --> 01:06:19,296
- Everybody ready?
- No.

929
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:23,072
- What?
- Well, Dick lost the form.

930
01:06:23,234 --> 01:06:24,958
- So....
- What?

931
01:06:25,602 --> 01:06:27,578
Do you have an extra copy?

932
01:06:27,748 --> 01:06:30,050
Do you have any idea
what I went through to get that? !

933
01:06:30,212 --> 01:06:32,220
Oh, let me guess, a fifth of Scotch!

934
01:06:32,997 --> 01:06:34,372
You son of a--

935
01:06:34,534 --> 01:06:36,477
Wait. Stop it. Knock it off!

936
01:06:36,647 --> 01:06:38,818
My God. Wait a second.
Can we get another one?

937
01:06:38,984 --> 01:06:40,510
Is that possible?
How can we do that?

938
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,469
You know what,
I'm gonna take the car...

939
01:06:42,633 --> 01:06:44,389
...and I'm gonna try
to delay McAllister.

940
01:06:44,553 --> 01:06:46,626
- He's here. He's here.
- Oh, God.

941
01:06:49,098 --> 01:06:50,659
- What are you--?
- I'm going.

942
01:06:57,645 --> 01:07:00,745
That was not cool.

943
01:07:02,862 --> 01:07:04,750
Okay. It's very simple. I got it.

944
01:07:04,911 --> 01:07:06,372
- I got it. It's very simple.
- What?

945
01:07:06,543 --> 01:07:09,839
Go into the bank. Go into the office
of the client-relations coordinator.

946
01:07:10,001 --> 01:07:13,546
The document forms are backed up
on her disk, you have to print one out.

947
01:07:13,714 --> 01:07:17,937
- Who's this guy? Do I say hello?
- Never mind. Just blow past them.

948
01:07:25,621 --> 01:07:27,476
Quaint.

949
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:30,929
McAllister, 1 2 o'clock.

950
01:07:31,095 --> 01:07:34,194
Okay, I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go stall him.

951
01:07:35,063 --> 01:07:36,493
- Hon.
- What?

952
01:07:36,664 --> 01:07:39,282
How am I supposed to find
the client-relations coordinator?

953
01:07:39,448 --> 01:07:41,424
Turn around.

954
01:07:58,462 --> 01:08:02,358
Oh, my-- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Jack McAllister.

955
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,506
- I'm sorry?
- It's me, Deb Festerbooth.

956
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:21,081
- Hi.
- Hi.

957
01:08:22,373 --> 01:08:25,275
Oh, is that the legendary
espresso machine?

958
01:08:25,766 --> 01:08:26,912
You want some?

959
01:08:27,079 --> 01:08:28,573
- Really, could l?
- Sure, yeah.

960
01:08:28,743 --> 01:08:30,499
- Good to see you.
- From the fundraiser.

961
01:08:30,663 --> 01:08:34,309
I am truly sorry,
but I really don't recall you, Miss... ?

962
01:08:34,473 --> 01:08:37,703
Festerbrook-- Booth. Yes.
No, listen, this is crazy.

963
01:08:37,866 --> 01:08:39,622
You have to remember.

964
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:47,973
- And here you go.
- Thank you.

965
01:08:48,141 --> 01:08:49,733
Oh, excuse me. That's my phone.

966
01:08:49,901 --> 01:08:51,559
Oh, me too.

967
01:08:53,327 --> 01:08:55,083
Grand Cayman Bank,
how may I help you?

968
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:57,327
Karen Williams, please.

969
01:08:59,536 --> 01:09:01,959
- This is Karen.
- Yes, Mrs. Williams...

970
01:09:02,128 --> 01:09:05,674
...this is Officer Redgreen...

971
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:08,329
...of the MVPDL.

972
01:09:08,498 --> 01:09:11,848
And we've recovered a stolen vehicle
that is registered in your name.

973
01:09:12,019 --> 01:09:14,509
We'd appreciate it if you could
come to the impound lot--

974
01:09:14,676 --> 01:09:16,781
What? My car's been stolen?

975
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:21,201
Don't you remember my tattoo
of a green monkey on my ass?

976
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:23,472
Someone stole my car
right out of the parking lot.

977
01:09:23,639 --> 01:09:25,133
No way.

978
01:09:33,626 --> 01:09:36,147
- Yeah.
- It's Dick.

979
01:09:36,443 --> 01:09:37,425
I got it.

980
01:09:39,195 --> 01:09:40,624
- Dick.
- Yeah.

981
01:09:40,956 --> 01:09:44,338
Is the client-relations coordinator
a blond woman with a red scarf?

982
01:09:44,509 --> 01:09:47,805
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- She noticed her car isn't stolen.

983
01:09:47,967 --> 01:09:51,546
- What's the account number?
- P-N-5-9-7...

984
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:53,653
P-N-5-9-7...

985
01:09:54,495 --> 01:09:57,246
- ...2-K-4-0.
- 2-4-K--

986
01:09:57,409 --> 01:09:59,744
No, 2-K-4-0.

987
01:10:03,906 --> 01:10:06,176
- Oh, my God.
- Got it.

988
01:10:06,979 --> 01:10:09,533
Oh, my God, my car!

989
01:10:09,701 --> 01:10:11,523
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

990
01:10:11,684 --> 01:10:13,725
- I didn't see you there.
- What is wrong with you?

991
01:10:13,894 --> 01:10:15,300
What's wrong with me?

992
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,502
You're parked
in a handicapped space.

993
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:20,421
- That's not a handicapped space.
- It is now!

994
01:10:20,871 --> 01:10:22,627
Yes!

995
01:10:46,607 --> 01:10:48,712
- What are you doing here?
- It's too late.

996
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:51,531
The account rep's authorizing
the CRM-1 1 4 right now.

997
01:10:51,696 --> 01:10:52,908
Oh, man!

998
01:10:56,882 --> 01:11:00,199
Wait a second.
He's not going back into the room.

999
01:11:01,395 --> 01:11:03,184
- Where is he going?
- I'm gonna go down...

1000
01:11:03,348 --> 01:11:06,513
...and get this stamped and initialed.
You stall him.

1001
01:11:06,868 --> 01:11:08,757
Oh, I hate stalling!

1002
01:11:08,918 --> 01:11:12,333
- Catches my dust.
- Traffic congestion.

1003
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:18,894
Hey, Spence, good to see
you again. How you been?

1004
01:11:20,216 --> 01:11:22,453
Well, thank you.

1005
01:11:22,969 --> 01:11:24,399
Will you excuse me for a moment?

1006
01:11:24,569 --> 01:11:26,425
- Of course.
- Yeah.

1007
01:11:26,586 --> 01:11:29,882
Say, Dick, I'm probably
gonna be arrested for DWI...

1008
01:11:30,043 --> 01:11:32,433
...so I won't be there
when you get out.

1009
01:11:32,764 --> 01:11:35,350
- Can we talk about this later?
- Look what I found in his car.

1010
01:11:35,933 --> 01:11:39,895
I don't wish to discuss this in front
of the branch employees, that's why.

1011
01:11:41,086 --> 01:11:44,251
Nobody likes to be the bad guy, Bill.
But here I am, chopping heads.

1012
01:11:50,593 --> 01:11:53,015
- I already verified--
- I understand the need for layoffs.

1013
01:11:53,186 --> 01:11:54,397
I'm concerned about morale.

1014
01:11:54,563 --> 01:11:56,930
I'm fine, really. Thank you
very much. Thank you.

1015
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:00,322
- Madam, can I have my form back?
- What did you just call me?

1016
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:02,656
I just don't wanna start
a bloodbath.

1017
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:05,406
- Can I have my form back?
- Your "forn"?

1018
01:12:05,574 --> 01:12:09,699
- Is that how you spell your name?
- Why don't I just do this for you, sir.

1019
01:12:09,863 --> 01:12:11,903
My form.

1020
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,011
You know, there is
one bright light here.

1021
01:12:15,177 --> 01:12:17,698
Spencer, the guy with the
stampy thing, he's top-drawer.

1022
01:12:17,865 --> 01:12:19,720
Thank you, sir.

1023
01:12:20,457 --> 01:12:21,952
Dick?

1024
01:12:22,121 --> 01:12:23,366
Dick Harper?

1025
01:12:25,932 --> 01:12:27,972
Jack McAllister.

1026
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:33,538
- You just struck me.
- Look what the cat coughed up.

1027
01:12:33,709 --> 01:12:36,907
My gosh, you cut an impressive
swath, I'll tell you that.

1028
01:12:37,071 --> 01:12:39,941
- And you smell good too, you devil.
- Just hold on a second.

1029
01:12:40,111 --> 01:12:42,119
What do you say
we put all this behind us.

1030
01:12:42,288 --> 01:12:45,704
- Dick, what are you doing here?
- You know, working, mostly, here...

1031
01:12:45,872 --> 01:12:47,783
...temporarily, over in Transfers.

1032
01:12:47,954 --> 01:12:50,093
- Okay? Just drop it.
- I heard you left town.

1033
01:12:50,259 --> 01:12:54,930
Yeah, I was in Mexico for a while. But
mostly I've been working in Transfers.

1034
01:12:55,092 --> 01:12:57,165
- Oh, I see.
- Poppycocker.

1035
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:59,473
I wanted to tell you that
you are my inspiration.

1036
01:12:59,637 --> 01:13:01,972
- There's no hard feelings?
- You did the best you could.

1037
01:13:02,134 --> 01:13:04,655
- That's all anybody could ask for.
- Decent of you to say.

1038
01:13:04,823 --> 01:13:06,350
Like my granddaddy
used to tell me--

1039
01:13:06,519 --> 01:13:07,894
Bye.

1040
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:09,972
It was so great. We did it!

1041
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:13,236
Mr. McAllister, please.

1042
01:13:15,162 --> 01:13:17,017
I don't know.
I think I made a mistake.

1043
01:13:17,178 --> 01:13:19,088
- Are you kidding? You were great!
- No, no, no.

1044
01:13:19,579 --> 01:13:20,562
Here we are, sir.

1045
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:22,586
Days like this,
they make my hands shake.

1046
01:13:22,747 --> 01:13:24,341
- Know what I'm saying?
- I can imagine.

1047
01:13:24,892 --> 01:13:27,162
- What's he doing?
- I don't know. What is he doing?

1048
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:30,259
We got one situation here,
now, fellas...

1049
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:32,635
...which is that that number wrong.

1050
01:13:32,799 --> 01:13:34,141
That's incorrect right there.

1051
01:13:35,936 --> 01:13:38,424
- Did he see us?
- I have no idea.

1052
01:13:38,592 --> 01:13:40,284
I think he saw you.

1053
01:13:41,697 --> 01:13:43,607
I think he saw you.

1054
01:13:43,778 --> 01:13:45,567
You were sticking your big head
out there.

1055
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:48,895
I gotta hit the road here, fellas,
so I'm gonna sign this for you...

1056
01:13:49,059 --> 01:13:50,782
- ... then you gonna change it.
- Yes.

1057
01:13:50,948 --> 01:13:53,796
Oh, man. You know,
this is really not the time.

1058
01:13:53,957 --> 01:13:56,608
This is really not the time.
Oh, God, he's coming.

1059
01:13:56,774 --> 01:13:58,979
- He's coming, hon.
- Okay.

1060
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:02,692
Jack, hey. It was great seeing you.

1061
01:14:03,175 --> 01:14:05,827
- Where's Frank Bascombe?
- Come again?

1062
01:14:06,505 --> 01:14:08,447
You didn't think I'd catch that,
now, did you?

1063
01:14:08,809 --> 01:14:11,625
- What do you mean?
- Here's what you're gonna do.

1064
01:14:11,786 --> 01:14:14,056
You're gonna turn around
and march out of here now.

1065
01:14:14,218 --> 01:14:16,074
You're gonna take Goldilocks
there with you.

1066
01:14:16,236 --> 01:14:20,427
And I won't put the two of you
in prison for a very long time.

1067
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:24,139
Actually, honey, I think that sounds
pretty good. I think....

1068
01:14:25,262 --> 01:14:26,823
I think we should take it,
you know.

1069
01:14:27,246 --> 01:14:28,807
You think so, hon?

1070
01:14:28,975 --> 01:14:30,153
I do.

1071
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,496
- Because I don't.
- Dick Harper.

1072
01:14:37,297 --> 01:14:40,647
I've been terminated, bankrupted,
deported and blackmailed...

1073
01:14:40,818 --> 01:14:42,346
...because of you.

1074
01:14:42,516 --> 01:14:45,680
And I'm not leaving here
without your money.

1075
01:14:48,469 --> 01:14:53,041
What you gonna do, Dick?
Shoot me if I don't approve that form?

1076
01:14:55,607 --> 01:14:57,462
Write me a check.

1077
01:14:59,927 --> 01:15:03,190
- You are kidding me.
- Dick, it's not gonna do us any good.

1078
01:15:03,353 --> 01:15:06,168
He's just gonna cancel it
the minute we walk out of here.

1079
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:08,152
I don't care.

1080
01:15:08,314 --> 01:15:10,038
I don't care.

1081
01:15:10,203 --> 01:15:13,106
I'm not walking out of this bank
empty-handed.

1082
01:15:17,341 --> 01:15:20,473
All right. All right, Dick,
I'm gonna write you a check.

1083
01:15:20,638 --> 01:15:23,737
- I'm gonna need my hand back.
- Gladly.

1084
01:15:25,247 --> 01:15:28,564
All right. Yes, sir.
I'm gonna write you that check.

1085
01:15:28,736 --> 01:15:30,908
And what's more,
I'm not gonna cancel it.

1086
01:15:31,073 --> 01:15:33,081
Because I think it takes
a lot of cojones...

1087
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:36,797
...to do what you two have done
here today. And I admire that.

1088
01:15:36,962 --> 01:15:38,369
So...

1089
01:15:39,876 --> 01:15:41,501
...here you go.

1090
01:15:41,892 --> 01:15:45,188
Just a little something to show you
what I think you're worth.

1091
01:15:53,031 --> 01:15:55,136
Y'all take care, now.

1092
01:15:59,817 --> 01:16:02,403
Dick, honey...

1093
01:16:03,402 --> 01:16:06,021
...give me the squirt gun, okay?

1094
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:13,000
Do you still have
McAllisters form?

1095
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:15,112
Why?

1096
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:20,494
Because I just got his signature.

1097
01:16:25,232 --> 01:16:27,305
Weren't you an art major?

1098
01:16:29,233 --> 01:16:32,202
Dick Harper! I had no idea
what you were doing.

1099
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:35,786
I was completely fooled.
My God, I didn't know you could act.

1100
01:16:35,955 --> 01:16:38,803
Hon, in 1 0th grade I played Biff
in Death of a Salesman.

1101
01:16:38,964 --> 01:16:40,492
- Come on.
- That's just--

1102
01:16:41,173 --> 01:16:43,345
See the way I got
my eyes watering up?

1103
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:47,123
Yes, sir. It's all right there.

1104
01:16:47,735 --> 01:16:50,102
I am married to a genius.

1105
01:16:50,263 --> 01:16:51,726
It's a turn-on, isn't it?

1106
01:16:51,897 --> 01:16:54,614
- You're a criminal.
- I'm a hardened criminal.

1107
01:16:55,641 --> 01:16:59,952
Hon, first we need
to talk to Spencer.

1108
01:17:00,731 --> 01:17:02,455
Right.

1109
01:17:08,188 --> 01:17:12,467
Are you in the habit of signing things
without looking at them?

1110
01:17:16,447 --> 01:17:18,335
Miss Sheinkopf?

1111
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:23,068
Miss Sheinkopf,
I'm gonna be home by 6.

1112
01:17:36,805 --> 01:17:39,261
- Mr. McAllister!
- Jack!

1113
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:42,369
- Mr. McAllister!
- Mr. McAllister!

1114
01:17:42,535 --> 01:17:45,569
We're all waiting for you over here,
Jack. Everybody's really pumped.

1115
01:17:45,735 --> 01:17:47,329
Come on!

1116
01:17:47,945 --> 01:17:49,407
Is this some kind of a joke, Dick?

1117
01:17:49,576 --> 01:17:51,300
Are you still trying
to get even with me?

1118
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:53,376
Why would I get even
with such a generous man?

1119
01:17:53,546 --> 01:17:56,449
I still can't believe you did that.
Jane and I were way off base.

1120
01:17:56,619 --> 01:18:00,002
- He's on in 20, right? Hook him up.
- Wait, on what?

1121
01:18:00,172 --> 01:18:01,383
Sam Samuels. MoneyLife.

1122
01:18:01,549 --> 01:18:05,030
Oh, and here are some
suggested responses.

1123
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,410
Live to Southern California,
where...

1124
01:18:10,576 --> 01:18:13,543
... in a stunning act of personal
generosity, Jack McAllister...

1125
01:18:13,712 --> 01:18:16,101
Who the hell do you think you are?

1126
01:18:16,272 --> 01:18:18,128
I'm your
VP of Communications, Jack.

1127
01:18:18,289 --> 01:18:21,071
- -personally funded the defunct
corporation's pension fund,

1128
01:18:22,354 --> 01:18:23,762
You said I just did what?

1129
01:18:23,923 --> 01:18:26,859
God, I love this guy,

1130
01:18:27,027 --> 01:18:32,114
But seriously, Jack,
what made you do it?

1131
01:18:32,278 --> 01:18:37,014
Well, l-- Sam, l....

1132
01:18:48,634 --> 01:18:52,344
I realized, Sam, that since
the employees of Globodyne...

1133
01:18:52,507 --> 01:18:56,567
...had given me so much, it was time
for me to give back to them.

1134
01:18:56,732 --> 01:19:00,990
So yesterday, I wire-transferred...

1135
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:02,938
...$400 million...

1136
01:19:03,711 --> 01:19:06,613
...into the newly created
Globodyne Pension Relief Fund.

1137
01:19:07,808 --> 01:19:09,401
Oh, yeah!

1138
01:19:14,561 --> 01:19:17,464
Let's look at what happened when
the first ex-Globodyne employees...

1139
01:19:17,635 --> 01:19:19,490
... received their shares of money,

1140
01:19:19,651 --> 01:19:22,848
Many people had their life savings
invested in the company...

1141
01:19:23,012 --> 01:19:25,860
...and were delighted to learn
their pensions had been returned,

1142
01:19:26,021 --> 01:19:28,356
It is the first time
in U, S, corporate history...

1143
01:19:28,518 --> 01:19:32,196
... that a CEO has personally funded
a bankrupted pension plan,

1144
01:19:32,359 --> 01:19:35,174
This incredible gesture won't soon
be forgotten by the people...

1145
01:19:35,335 --> 01:19:37,725
... whose lives it has
so dramatically affected,

1146
01:19:37,895 --> 01:19:39,239
And this is just the beginning,

1147
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,183
In the coming months, thousands
more will be receiving a check...

1148
01:19:42,345 --> 01:19:45,729
... for the full value of their
lost pensions and life savings,

1149
01:19:47,595 --> 01:19:49,733
Jack, Jack, he's got your back!

1150
01:19:49,932 --> 01:19:52,168
Jack, Jack, he's got your back!

1151
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:54,405
Jack, Jack, he's got your back!

1152
01:19:54,572 --> 01:19:56,646
You hear that? They love you, Jack.

1153
01:19:56,813 --> 01:19:58,603
- Now, go to hell.
- Mr. McAllister...

1154
01:19:58,766 --> 01:20:00,971
...do you consider yourself
a modern-day Robin Hood?

1155
01:20:01,135 --> 01:20:03,982
- Does this mean you're off the hook?
- Do you wanna save the whales?

1156
01:20:07,824 --> 01:20:09,483
Now, hang on a minute.

1157
01:20:11,089 --> 01:20:13,261
Have you decided to contribute
to the homeless?

1158
01:20:13,426 --> 01:20:15,314
What made you so gracious?

1159
01:20:16,563 --> 01:20:18,703
Mr. McAllister,
how do you feel right now?

1160
01:20:18,868 --> 01:20:21,586
Mr. McAllister, how about giving
a brother a buck?

1161
01:20:24,501 --> 01:20:27,023
Look at our beautiful family.

1162
01:20:31,767 --> 01:20:33,841
My name is Dick Harper.

1163
01:20:40,827 --> 01:20:44,144
- I agree.
- Hey, Harpers, stick them up!

1164
01:20:44,315 --> 01:20:45,843
- Look who it is.
- Hey, Garth.

1165
01:20:46,011 --> 01:20:47,287
