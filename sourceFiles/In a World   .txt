1
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,313
Greetings, Americans.

2
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:25,983
Leave a message after the beep,
but not if you're going to mumble,

3
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:30,071
because a voice is not just a blessing,
it's also a choice.

4
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,576
Hey, Carol. lt's Louis from Sound Mix-A-Lot.

5
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:40,289
l'm just calling real quick
because Eva Longoria, the actress,

6
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:44,460
she has to re-loop her lines for an entire film
where she plays a cockney mob wife.

7
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,547
l attached the sound file for you to check out.

8
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,257
She sounds like a retarded pirate,

9
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,968
so the studio is paying
to have her work with a coach.

10
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,720
And l thought of you.

11
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,055
Sorry, l never use the word "retarded"
in a derogatory way.

12
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,306
l hate people who do that.

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,684
Sorry, if you have a cousin or a friend
who's retarded,

14
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,520
l didn't mean it that way. So, sorry about
that.

15
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,731
ls that what you think, you stupid slapper?

16
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,068
Is that what you fink?

17
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,321
l don't give a shit about what you think!

18
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,657
ls that what you think, you stupid slapper?

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,584
This Wednesday, one woman
will teach another woman

20
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,420
to sound a little less retarded.

21
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,131
ln a world

22
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,967
like nothing you've ever imagined.

23
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,219
Without a single unified voice,

24
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,848
humanity has been left searching for
answers to the unknown.

25
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,185
Now, one man has the power
to change that.

26
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,519
One man.

27
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,104
Me.

28
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,399
When the storm hit, both our cars
were totally underwater.

29
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:52,361
ln a world where both of our cars
were totally underwater.

30
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,072
We thought it would take forever
to get some help.

31
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,117
But a new wind was about to blow.

32
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,411
There's hundreds of people
doing voice work,

33
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,371
but only five of them
are making all the money.

34
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,706
Yeah. That's as it should be.

35
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,046
l'm sorry. As long as l'm one of the five,
that's as it should be.

36
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,967
ls it true that sometimes you will do
60 promos a week, 35 in a day?

37
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,804
Oh, yeah. That's...That's actually
not uncommon at all.

38
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,931
That's pretty much a slow week
in many cases.

39
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,142
Odds are you already knew the voice
of Don LaFontaine,

40
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,061
who died in Los Angeles Tuesday.

41
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,395
He was 68.

42
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:31,108
He was the Don. He was the guy.
Nobody really could ever compare to him.

43
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,735
When we were young, for a while,

44
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,656
we were both referred to
as the "it boys" of the voice over world,

45
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,324
which l thought was kind of amusing,

46
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,410
because l never met a boy
with pipes like these.

47
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,162
"ln a world..."

48
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,832
Those words were for Don only.

49
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,166
-l mean...
-There's no question about that.

50
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:52,171
But l think that it could safely be said
everybody wants a piece of that legacy.

51
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:57,093
Meet Thomas Coyne.
He's out of cents and he's $3 short.

52
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,427
Ever since I was a kid,

53
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:04,684
l remember hearing Don coo those words,
"ln a world... ln a world..." You know?

54
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,436
And when l heard that
l was like, "l want to be a part of that world.

55
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,481
"l want to be part of that world. That world."

56
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:16,070
For whoever takes his place,
those are gigantic shoes to fill.

57
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,490
l think Don was a... l think a size 1 1 .

58
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:24,579
lt is true that l happen to be a 1 3.

59
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,164
l don't know if you can see that,
but it's just the truth.

60
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,749
Whether or not that matters,
l don't know.

61
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,693
Why aren't the humidifiers on?

62
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,778
l'm dead.

63
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,572
Fuckin' Christ.

64
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,828
Listen, did Gustav Warner happen to call?

65
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,998
-Jesus Christ.
-He and l are getting a steam later.

66
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,834
l'm not home.

67
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,962
Did Gustav call?

68
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:19,884
God, Dad. l don't know why you...
l can do what that guy does.

69
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,886
What the hell does that have to do
with anything?

70
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:29,518
This Wednesday, one woman will
teach another woman

71
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,104
to sound less...

72
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:38,069
This Wednesday, one woman
will teach another woman...

73
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,113
l just woke up, so my voice is cold, but...

74
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,699
Look, are you hungry?
Jamie worked me up an appetite.

75
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,534
l'm gonna rustle us up some grub.

76
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,703
Oh, my God. "Grub"?

77
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,246
l'm gonna make breaky.

78
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,581
"Breaky"?

79
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,750
Jesus, what the fuck
is wrong with you, Carol?

80
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,210
You know, l say, "Black," you say, "White."

81
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,753
-l'm gonna eat out here.
-You're yelling so much. Why?

82
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,296
-You don't want to come, stay in bed.
-lt's so early.

83
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:00,049
Her name is Erin and her other name is Erin.

84
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,177
So you know that mentally unstable guy
who lives in front of the Quiznos?

85
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,261
No.

86
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:08,432
You remember, he's the lunatic
who's got that crazy German brogue.

87
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,850
You know, this is Jamie's favorite show.

88
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,811
Actually, it's quite good.
You should check it out.

89
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,854
l think he's from Munich or something,

90
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,856
but l wanted to get his voice
for my archives.

91
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:19,735
And he's always lecturing how the world's
real currency is lettuce,

92
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,153
so l had to buy a head of romaine

93
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,280
-to negotiate with him.
-l can't wait to see you, puppy.

94
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,075
l'm gonna purr to you all night long.

95
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,327
Voice mail, huh?

96
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,247
-l'm sorry, sweetie. What's up?
-Nothing.

97
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,499
Where is "the groupie" anyway?

98
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,251
What, is she busy at a smiling convention
somewhere?

99
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,504
Jamie is doing re-shoots
for a Ziploc commercial she got.

100
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,298
Jesus. That girl is bad news, Dad. l mean...

101
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,426
Honestly, she smells like Life Savers

102
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,845
and she has
a Midwestern accent, un-ironically.

103
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,055
Moreover, she should be paying us rent.
She's here a lot.

104
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,224
Jamie is going to be moving in, sweetheart.

105
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,601
You're gonna have to find
another place to live now.

106
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,439
-What? She's 26!
-She's 30.

107
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,607
-That's my age.
-You're 31 now.

108
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,402
-Okay, barely.
-Look, she's an adult. That's the point.

109
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,195
She collects rainbow magnets!

110
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,780
-At least she likes me.
-For the wrong reasons.

111
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,323
Well, they're right enough for me.

112
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,701
l'm appalled, Dad. l'm appalled.

113
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,120
Look, l'm feeling happy
for the first time in quite a while.

114
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,372
You know what?
l think this is just a validation thing. l do.

115
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,624
l think you should start spinning again.
l've been thinking about...

116
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,418
Carol, l love you,
but let me tell you something.

117
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,295
You're not gonna be able
to talk me out of this, okay?

118
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,839
Jamie printed me out an article
from Yahoo! Health.

119
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,051
lt was all about enabling,
and l realized at that point

120
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,304
l cannot continue to support
your emotional handicap.

121
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,681
-l understand. Okay.
-Let me finish, okay?

122
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:35,352
Sometimes, l get the feeling
l've done all l could for you, kid.

123
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,105
l mean, l let you share my crash pad
with me for years.

124
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,316
l shared all my contacts in the biz with you.

125
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,487
Listen, if l could break you off a piece
of this voice and give it to you, l would.

126
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,573
But l can't,
because that's an impossible conceit.

127
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:48,824
And the truth of the matter is,

128
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,202
it probably wouldn't help you anyway
because, let's face it,

129
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,579
the industry does not crave a female sound.

130
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,748
Yeah, Dad, you've made me painfully aware
of that my whole life.

131
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,750
-l'm not being sexist, that's just the truth.
-Okay.

132
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,377
This whole voice-cracking
problem you've grown into

133
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,837
isn't doing you any favors either.

134
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,590
But here's what l'm trying to say,
sweetheart. Okay?

135
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,217
You should stick with the accents.

136
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,761
l mean, that's your thing.
That's what you're good at.

137
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,931
What was that great Russian Star Wars thing
you used to do as a kid?

138
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,516
Yeah, l know the one you're talking about.
But, Dad...

139
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,352
-What was it?
-lt was... Don't make me do it.

140
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,187
-Come on.
-l don't want to do it.

141
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,855
Please let me hear it.

142
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,691
Deese are not the droids
you're lookink for.

143
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,530
l just love that. lt's so random.

144
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:32,785
But listen, l can't pay rent

145
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,954
with the freelance vocal coaching.

146
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,164
-So, why don't we think of an agreement...
-Sweetheart,

147
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,083
not my problem. You understand?

148
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,795
Listen, l'm gonna support you
by not supporting you.

149
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,589
Okay, but what's the timeline on this?
Can you at least let me...

150
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,591
-Look, there's no big hurry.
-Okay, good. Because...

151
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,760
Tonight would be good.

152
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,311
The search is on, my friend.

153
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,397
What's that?

154
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,816
There's a great big epic
coming down the pike.

155
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,027
They wanna bring "lt" back.

156
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,948
Copy starts with the words,
"ln a world..."

157
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,826
And right now,
they're trying to find their guy.

158
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,870
How can they do that without LaFontaine?

159
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,455
He coined the phrase,
he's the godfather of the industry.

160
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,667
Enough with that, please!
That Don LaFontaine stuff. All right?

161
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,461
"Donnie was the...
Was the godfather of the industry."

162
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,547
"Donnie had perfect tone."
"Donnie had a big dick."

163
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,840
Donnie this, Donnie that!

164
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,967
All right, the guy was the best.
You think l don't know that?

165
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,510
No, Sam, that's not what l meant.

166
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,972
l know what you meant. l understand.
lt's just... lt's just...

167
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,682
What is it?

168
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,268
l'm sorry, Gustav. lt's just hard.

169
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,437
l know.

170
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,606
l know l'm not as good as he was.

171
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,861
You know what? You.

172
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,155
You're their guy.

173
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,157
-That's right.
-Sam...

174
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,367
lf they want me to do it, sure.

175
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,494
l wrote the book. l lived that life.

176
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,122
l'm getting a Lifetime Achievement Award
for Christ's sake.

177
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,626
And the fact of the matter is, l could never
really do it as good as Don. No, no.

178
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,671
lt's time. lt's time to pass the torch.

179
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,548
What are you saying?

180
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,303
l'm saying,
l'm going to go to bat for you, kid.

181
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,517
Moe, l am simply saying
that it was on the counter this morning,

182
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,228
and that you just must have moved it.
That's it.

183
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,521
Honey, you've misplaced it. That's all.

184
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,566
Okay. So, you're accusing me of losing
my wedding ring! Got it.

185
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,486
Now see, l feel like that sounds kind
of argumentative.

186
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,862
Moe, l'm not going to have an argument

187
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,823
about whether we're having
a goddamn argument or not, right?

188
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,952
That's the only kind of argument
l know how to have.

189
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,246
-l'm coming.
-l'm somewhat practiced at it.

190
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,747
Dad kicked me out.

191
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,540
-Hey, Carol.
-What? What happened?

192
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,752
-l need to wash everything l own.
-Carol, could you have called?

193
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,546
l did, Dani, but you don't answer
your telephone.

194
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,215
-That's not my fault.
-What happened?

195
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,758
l'm glad l didn't throw away my lucky couch.

196
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,886
Okay. The groupie's moving in with Dad.
Can you believe it?

197
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,763
-She's 23.
-She's 30.

198
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,682
Well, it's your fault for introducing them.

199
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,059
l didn't. You always do that. No, you do.

200
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,519
-What is in this bag?
-That was a different one.

201
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,063
So the autobiography and winning
a Lifetime Achievement Award

202
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,524
aren't enough? He's gotta have a concubine?

203
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,567
Your dad is a sexy cool guy.
Give him a break.

204
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,696
"A sexy cool guy"?
What's the matter with you?

205
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:31,588
So, you can use a plane.
Then you exit to the two exit door.

206
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,967
The door is on automatchically.

207
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:39,555
The... You see the...

208
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,642
Up the stair and the down stair.
You go to up the stair.

209
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:49,690
Then little building here.
The little building, go, go walk way.

210
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:55,571
You... You see the park.
The park is... Okay...

211
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,448
What's your favorite craft?

212
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:01,076
Well, l really like making pottery.

213
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,704
-lt's like... Like it's amazing...
-Like in Ghost?

214
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,291
-Yeah, it's amazing!
-l think if you walk away, you see that.

215
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,048
lt's like if a Beanie Baby could talk.

216
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,591
l love your gloss.

217
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:21,430
Please do not accost my clientele here
with your goddamn recorders.

218
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,683
The Eastern Europeans
are a really paranoid group already.

219
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,102
l say that it's for "artistic research"
and they, like, love it.

220
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,979
They don't understand that.
They think that you're a spy.

221
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,022
-Okay?
-Excuse me.

222
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,774
Good afternoon, Mr. Pouncer.
How can l help you?

223
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,984
Well, there's this mate of mine, right,

224
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,820
and he's a little under the weather
at the moment.

225
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,781
So l want to send him this.

226
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,657
Medicine.

227
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,203
-Very good.
-There's his address and information.

228
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,662
Do you think
you could do that for me, love?

229
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,705
Absolutely. Consider it done.

230
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,332
-Thanks a million.
-Have a lovely day.

231
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,377
Sure, now that l've seen you,
l most definitely will.

232
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,669
Get out of here.

233
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:56,423
l'm sorry. His voice is a vision.
What could l do?

234
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,633
Go to your meeting.

235
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,884
For someone who works in hospitality,

236
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,095
you're really inhospitable.
You know that, Dani?

237
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,679
lf they paid me a little more, l'd be nicer.

238
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,765
Stop it! Don't do that! Get out!

239
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,519
And l need to check out
other facilities but right...

240
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,024
You gotta be kidding me.

241
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,660
Hey, l'm here to see Louis.

242
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,497
Hi! l'm Nancy. l'm new.

243
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,376
-Have a seat. l'll let Louis know you're here.
-Okay.

244
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,593
You're Sam Sotto's kid, right?

245
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,846
Yeah, how'd you know?

246
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,682
Your dad is so hot.

247
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,726
Sorry. l just bought his autobiography.

248
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,856
l love to read. So, l'm like always reading.

249
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,358
lt's important.

250
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,278
Very cool. Cool.

251
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,781
Sotto Jr.'s here.

252
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,992
lt's just Solomon.

253
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:09,371
lt's Carol Solomon,
"Sotto" is my dad's stage name.

254
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,791
Guess you didn't get to that part in
the book.

255
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:14,585
Carol.

256
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:18,005
-Hey.
-What up, playa?

257
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,966
All right. Come on.
Let's make something shiny out of shit!

258
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,302
-Great.
-All right.

259
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,263
Hey, so, really sorry about that stupid
rambling message

260
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,639
l left on your machine the other day

261
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,974
when l said "retarded" a bunch of times.

262
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,392
l didn't mean actually retarded.

263
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:34,146
l think l just get nervous or something when
l'm leaving a message on your machine.

264
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,230
Your dad might hear it

265
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,733
and l'm doing a voice over
basically on your phone.

266
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,776
You don't have to worry
about it anymore 'cause l moved out.

267
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,737
So you can just call me on my cell directly.

268
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,821
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

269
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,491
Oh, cool. Definitely.
l'll definitely call you on your cell, you know.

270
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,202
lf the situation calls for it, professionally,
l'll call you on the cell.

271
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,579
-l'm not gonna bum rush you or anything.
-Okay.

272
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,372
l should cut you with a knife, l should.

273
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,500
ls that what you think?

274
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,418
ls that what you think, you stupid slapper?

275
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,380
Just remember the "F" for the "T-H."

276
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:04,218
Like "F" for "fink," "fink,"
versus, like, "think."

277
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,345
-What do you fink, you stupid...
-Yeah.

278
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,931
-Say it, say it.
-ls zat whot you fink, you stupid slappa?

279
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,807
ls zat whot you fink, you stupid slappa?

280
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:11,892
Yeah. There it is.

281
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,143
ls zat whot you fink, you stupid slappa?

282
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,770
-Should we try one?
-Okay. Yeah.

283
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,355
Okay. l'll do a series and we'll keep it open.

284
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,440
ls zat whot you fink, you stupid slappa?

285
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,527
-Nice work.
-Guess who's a no show!

286
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,445
Gustav Jizz Nuggets.

287
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,447
Hey. l'm in a session, Heners. Come on.

288
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:29,159
Louis, l gotta turn this temp track in today.
l was gonna do it myself, but...

289
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:33,247
No, no, no! You sound like an angry Muppet.
Get Cher. lt'll be better.

290
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,666
Cher sounds like a sleepy chipmunk.

291
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,793
l can do it. l mean, l'll do it.

292
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,421
l'm no Don LaFontaine,
but if it's just a temp recording, l can do it.

293
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,798
No, that'd be perfect.

294
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,007
l needed to do this 1 0 minutes ago.
Thank you.

295
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,135
Eva, could you just put the cork back
in your mouth and work on those vowels?

296
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,722
-Thank you.
-A-E-I-O-U, A-E-I-O-U...

297
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,392
So, princess boy will not be gracing us

298
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:57,062
with his shitty vocals
for this piece of dung trailer

299
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,648
for a fucking romantic comedy with children.

300
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,316
This is for Welcome to the Jungle Gym.

301
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,985
Hey, Gustav's sound is tight.

302
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,070
Do not judge him
for being monetarily privileged.

303
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,072
-Carol, you want a water or a Fanta?
-l'd like a Fanta.

304
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,658
l'm sorry, l have no time for a rich kid

305
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,119
who threw away his inheritance
on a soccer team

306
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,496
and then somehow fell into being
the highest paid voice over artist...

307
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,081
Okay, Carol, why don't you
just hop in the booth.

308
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,874
He's lucky he's got those pipes,

309
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,918
otherwise he'd be a washed-up
mortgage trader right now.

310
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:23,088
Thanks for asking me
if l wanted a Fanta, Louis.

311
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:24,715
Do you want a Fanta?

312
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,216
No.

313
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,719
Here we go. Here we go.

314
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,345
Carol, can you hear me in there?

315
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,680
Yeah, l hear you perfect.

316
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,901
Ready, ready.

317
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,696
Okay. Welcome to the Jungle Gym promo,
take one.

318
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,787
Allo Carol!

319
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,956
-Eva Longoria.
-Allo.

320
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,291
Where'd you go? You just ran off.

321
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,127
Oh, sorry. l thought we were done.
You said we were done, right?

322
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,714
Yeah, yeah. We're done.
But you forgot your Fanta.

323
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,425
Thanks. Back to stupid slappers.

324
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:09,801
Stupid slappa!

325
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:10,927
Yes, very good. You lead.

326
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,889
Stupid slappa!
That's what you fink, you stupid slappa!

327
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,182
-You want some Fanta?
-No.

328
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,772
lt's in the fridge, Moe.

329
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,899
lt's not. Otherwise, l'd have it.
And you'd have it.

330
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,193
-We'd all have it. lt would be great.
-Let me just do it.

331
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:29,154
lt's not a matter of you doing it, okay?
We're out of soy vanilla.

332
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,822
You guys are so loud.

333
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,574
Weren't you supposed to be in charge
of that?

334
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,035
Well, l will be from now on. Okay?

335
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:36,953
Love you!

336
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,373
"l love you, too, Moe. Have a great day."

337
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,249
"You, too. Thank you, sweetness."

338
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,337
-Obviously, butter side down.
-Oh, no.

339
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:52,052
-lt's okay.
-Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Let's live.

340
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,859
You're killing me, Dani.

341
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:14,991
Mr. Pouncer, hi. l'm so sorry.
l just didn't see you there. l'm so sorry.

342
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,119
How can l help you today, sir?

343
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,162
l just noticed you're not wearing
a wedding ring.

344
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,456
So now l'm never gonna leave you alone,
am l?

345
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,834
-Sir...
-No, l'm not a sir.

346
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,752
No, you have to do something brave

347
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,338
or do a shit ton of drugs in a rock band
to be one of those. No, no, no.

348
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,840
l am a Terry, however.

349
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,137
-Terry.
-Terry. Hi.

350
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:39,975
Hi, Terry.
Can l get you anything today, Terry?

351
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,645
No, actually. l just wanted to see if l
could get you to call me Terry.

352
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,814
And l just did.

353
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,024
That's what me mother calls me, you see.

354
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,401
Cheers!

355
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,653
Cheers. Cheers.

356
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,950
Relax, Dani, you're acting like
l'm the first guy to ever hit on you.

357
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,626
Good afternoon, Concierge.

358
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,044
Yes, good afternoon.

359
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,338
Carol, l can't talk right now. l'm super busy.

360
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,758
No, you're not.
l'm standing right behind you.

361
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,427
-Just kidding. Psych.
-That's not funny, Carol.

362
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,762
What?

363
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:22,225
Do you know that your neighbor Pippa
is from Guildford?

364
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,603
And l had a really nice chat with her...

365
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,355
Because you are all out of soya vanilla.
They say "soya."

366
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,233
What's up, Carol?
What do you want? l got a lot of things to do.

367
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:33,278
All right. Fine, fine.
l'm gonna try the soft sell on this,

368
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,864
but you know that's really, really hard for me.

369
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:40,410
Sister code, Dani.
l really need that Pouncer guy,

370
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,162
the lrish good-looking guy.

371
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,080
l need his accent for my archives

372
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,708
because, really, it's one of the accents
that l struggle with.

373
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,252
-Really, Dani.
-No, no. No, Carol.

374
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,171
The news clips that l have,
they're too regional.

375
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,381
And in order to really master a dialect,

376
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,384
you need to have these vowels.
Dani, come on!

377
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,887
-Fine.
-You're just... Did you say fine?

378
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,055
Yeah.

379
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,139
Great!

380
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:04,226
Oh, so, there's one issue, though.

381
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,393
What?

382
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,979
Your manager has, like,
a fake restraining order on me or something

383
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,149
because the Bulgarian guy that l followed
out last time happened to be a diplomat.

384
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:14,110
l didn't know about it.
lt was a thing... Wouldn't have done it.

385
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,737
God damn it, Carol!

386
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:16,905
Hindsight was 20-20.

387
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,533
What? What do you want?
What do you need?

388
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,869
Okay. So sister code. lt's super easy.
All you have to do is...

389
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,830
l'm gonna drop off
my little interview questions

390
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,706
and the recorder
and you just press "Record."

391
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,876
Ask the questions. The guy answers it. Done.

392
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,963
Sister code. Done deal. Sister code.

393
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,757
What is this "sister code" thing
that you're doing right now?

394
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:36,925
What? Sister code?

395
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,426
"What? Sister code?"

396
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,136
Yeah, it's a new thing. l was just trying it out.

397
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,513
Do you like it?

398
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,223
l don't know. l don't really like it.

399
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:47,686
What? Ping-pong it a little bit.
Like l say, "Sister," you say...

400
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,271
l'm not saying it.

401
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,356
l won't push my luck.
But you'll do the interview questions?

402
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,608
Look, l'm going to do it. Okay?
l'm doing it.

403
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:54,943
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

404
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,987
l love you. Sister code.

405
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,154
No.

406
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,614
Okay. Bye.

407
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,451
How did Mission lreland go?

408
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,911
Yeah. Really good.

409
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,914
l'm gonna drop off the equipment now.
l can't believe she said yes.

410
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,166
Yeah, me neither.
She could lose herjob if she's caught.

411
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:11,793
Oh, my God, you're so dramatic.

412
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,337
Yello.

413
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,506
-You booked that gig!
-What gig?

414
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,799
Welcome to the Jungle Gym.

415
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,050
Who did?

416
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,219
You did! The studio heard
the temp recording you did

417
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:24,180
and they want your voice
on the trailer, Carol.

418
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:25,557
But l'm a chick.

419
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,017
Yeah, l know. l'm acutely aware of that.

420
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,478
The studio said they feel that
it's a "modern, quirky" choice.

421
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,606
-A what?
-And that you're perfect for the genre.

422
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,482
Children's romantic comedy is a genre now?

423
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:38,737
Who cares? You just took a job,
a huge job from Gustav Warner.

424
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:39,821
l did?

425
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,823
Yeah. You just served up a can
of warning soup

426
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,867
to the Warn-dog himself!

427
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,496
l say next up, lemon drop shots on me.

428
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,166
Are you excited or trying to fart?

429
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,794
Hello? Carol?

430
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,215
Okay. All right. All right, then.
All right, let's get those shots.

431
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,219
All right, okay. l'll see you tonight then.
All right. Okay.

432
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,055
l know she hung up already.

433
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,058
lt's that obvious?

434
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,234
-Hello?
-Dad, l...

435
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,570
-Hello?
-Can you hear me?

436
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:23,073
-What's that?
-Sorry. Wait. Can you hear me now?

437
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,741
Gotcha!

438
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,119
This is my voice mail message.
l'm unable to take your call...

439
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,245
Really?

440
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,455
What?

441
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:33,500
l lost it to a broad? Are you kidding me?

442
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,460
No, why would l be kidding you?

443
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,713
You know this is all happening because
l got sick and l couldn't perform that day.

444
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:39,839
Put it down.

445
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,218
Siegel. l smell legal. l smell legal!

446
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,055
Well, get off the phone with me
and get on the phone with them!

447
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,391
l'm sorry, Sam.

448
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,185
-l'm sorry you had to hear that.
-No, no, no! Listen, don't apologize.

449
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,980
lt's fine. Times are changing.
That's the way it is.

450
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,899
Nowadays, they're flying planes,
they're taking jobs.

451
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,360
-That's just the reality.
-Welcome to today's world.

452
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:04,114
l mean, it wasn't too long ago that l can
remember, all l had to worry about

453
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:07,325
with the ladies was how quickly to get their
panties off. You understand?

454
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,411
-Yeah. Yeah.
-And l don't want you to fret.

455
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,998
As soon as you get to resurrect
those three little words, buddy,

456
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,250
you are gonna own this town.

457
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:19,754
Amen to that. Amen to that, Sam.

458
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,514
Hi, Moe!

459
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,890
Pippa! Hey!

460
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,100
ls Dani here?

461
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,102
No, actually. No, she's at work.

462
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:38,189
Look, l'm really sorry. l know l do this
all the time. lt's just one tiny...

463
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,357
No, no, no. Go ahead.

464
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:42,444
Please, l'm taking a break from work.
Making a PB & J.

465
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,071
-Peanut butter and jelly.
-Jam.

466
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,782
"Jam." Right, right.

467
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,453
This is really awkward, Moe, but the thing is,
our drain's busted in our flat.

468
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,789
My mate is dealing with it at the moment.
But the pipes need cleaning. Who knew?

469
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,959
And l haven't showered in three days.
And l stink. lt's disgusting.

470
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,963
Oh, right! God, l've been
in my sweat pants for, like, years.

471
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,424
l was just wondering
if l could use your shower.

472
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,925
Yours and Dani's shower.

473
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,307
That's weird, isn't it? l'm sorry.

474
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:17,312
No, no, no. l'm sorry.
Yes! l think that'll be totally fine.

475
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,774
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. Of course. Yes.

476
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,902
l'll be back in a jiff. Okay!

477
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,361
All right.

478
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:34,662
lt's not a big deal.

479
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,501
Hey.

480
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:43,588
Hey. l was just trying to see
if you're coming home for dinner,

481
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,050
because l was... l was cooking a...

482
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,885
What?

483
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,595
l was cooking a sandwich bar.

484
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,347
A sandwich bar?

485
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,934
Yep. For dinner. l was cooking
a sandwich bar. You know.

486
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,395
Cold cuts and rolls and mustards.

487
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,940
No. l think l gotta stay.

488
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,193
They want me to help out
with some corporate thing tonight.

489
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,904
Oh, great! l mean, whatever. No.

490
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:11,199
We'll just do a sandwich bar
another night. l mean, it's so easy.

491
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,867
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

492
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,838
Hello, shower friend!

493
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,173
Hello! l'm shower ready!

494
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,510
lt's right over there. ln the bathroom.

495
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,761
Thank you.

496
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:32,887
No, thank you.

497
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:34,597
What?

498
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,142
Do you need help with anything?

499
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,519
No. l'm good. l've got it from here.

500
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,648
There's a tricky hot-and-cold ratio thing.

501
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,318
So if you get into a jam.
lf you get into a "jam,"

502
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:50,488
just holler, or, you know.

503
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,159
-Hey!
-Hi!

504
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,285
Are you okay?

505
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,369
Pippa's naked in the shower.

506
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,996
-Who?
-Pippa.

507
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,456
-Why?
-Her pipes need cleaning.

508
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,458
You look like you swallowed a frog.
What's wrong with you?

509
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,918
What is this? PB & J? Nice.

510
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,753
Yeah. lt's peanut butter and jam.

511
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,338
Dani's not coming home for dinner,
so l thought...

512
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,091
Who cares? l just texted her that she doesn't
have to do Mission lreland

513
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,886
because the vocal coaching
is temporarily on hiatus.

514
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,970
Why?

515
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,681
Oh, because l just got offered another
children's movie trailer

516
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,101
and l just came from an audition
where l might be the voice of Sunny Delight!

517
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:25,231
Dude! Wow!
You're cleaning up is what, sister!

518
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,442
Wow! Did you tell your dad?

519
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,653
No, but l will.

520
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,447
-Sunny D!
-Yeah.

521
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:24,415
You're always taking care of me,
so l am thrilled to be able to return the favor.

522
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,252
Well, it is my job to get you what you want.

523
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:31,506
Darling, you don't get me what l want,
you get me what l ask for.

524
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,883
l'm sure what l want would make you blush.

525
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,138
Really? You're funny.

526
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,765
That's funny. Okay.

527
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,434
Setting it out right here.

528
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:45,520
One-two, one-two.

529
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,063
l think it's working.

530
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,065
Okay, sorry, first question.

531
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,027
What makes you laugh?
That's an odd question.

532
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,780
Sorry. My sister's strange.

533
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,784
l'm definitely going.
Mimi and l need to have post-party sex.

534
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,077
Come on. Are you serious?

535
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,955
You hate Gustav,
why would you go to his party?

536
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,540
A few more like that, Carlos.

537
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,875
Rape him for his open bar, idiot.

538
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,128
Yeah, l have enough beer at home, thanks.

539
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,629
Besides, l don't have a date.

540
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,007
You don't have a date.
You're not supposed to go with a date.

541
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,591
You're supposed to leave with a date.

542
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:18,469
-That's the point. What is this, the '50s?
-Okay.

543
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,722
Well, l feel safer with the buddy system.

544
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:24,726
Don't act like those parties aren't the worst.
A voice over party?

545
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,146
l'm tired of waiting for the bathroom
and hearing the voice of Cialis

546
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,606
hitting on the
Virgin America message-hold girl.

547
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,650
l'm not going to beg you to go, man.

548
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,402
Ask Carol.

549
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,611
What?

550
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,363
You should ask Carol to the party.

551
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,698
Really?

552
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,616
-Yeah.
-Wow, okay.

553
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:44,579
l think that's probably the single worst idea
you ever had, Cher. Nice one.

554
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,540
-Hello.
-Hey. You busy?

555
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,418
-No, l'm just leaving this audition thing.
-CooI, cooI.

556
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,628
Hey, so listen,
l was calling 'cause l was just wondering

557
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:55,548
if you had any plans for tonight.

558
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:03,556
For like... Like to just... For what?

559
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,517
There's this thing, just this party thing.

560
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:11,397
-Oh, what, the Gustav party?
-Yeah, totally lame, right?

561
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,191
l'm obviously not going...

562
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:18,488
-l'm actually going.
-l mean, l might go, but l don't wanna go.

563
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,033
So are you going with anyone?

564
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,536
Yeah. My dad's girlfriend
wants me and my sister to go to it,

565
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:28,456
like, as a bonding thing or something.
lt's gonna be whack.

566
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,667
Totally whack! Wickedy whack, baby!
You know what l'm talking about?

567
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,669
That's probably why l'm not going, actually.

568
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,339
Honestly, the only reason why
l'm going is just to network.

569
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,467
Cool. l mean, l think that's a smart move.

570
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,512
lf l were in your situation,
l would definitely do that. Nice.

571
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,681
-lt would be more fun if you were there.
-l'm gonna get this call.

572
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,141
-What?
-Didn't you hear what l said?

573
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,810
-No, what did you say?
-Excuse me?

574
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,645
No, l was just... Hello?

575
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,064
-Please take your other call.
-Okay. Later.

576
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,732
Do you know where l can get a smoothie
around here?

577
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,652
l'm sorry. l do not...

578
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,237
l'm sorry. l didn't hear what you said.

579
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,697
l said l don't know where you'd get
a smoothie around here at all.

580
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:02,824
l'm so sorry.

581
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:03,908
Oh, okay. Thanks so much.

582
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,076
Yeah. No worries.

583
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,372
Have you seen my stress ball?
What is your problem?

584
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,665
Carol's going to the party tonight.

585
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,291
-With you?
-No.

586
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,668
Are you gonna ask her?

587
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,836
l just told her l'm not going.

588
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,087
Why would you do that?

589
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,296
l don't know, Cher!

590
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,173
How you going to eat the apple
if you got no teeth?

591
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,842
What?

592
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,678
She's saying stop being a pussy
and bring Nancy as your date tonight

593
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,887
to make Carol jealous.

594
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,181
Thank you, Carlos. l don't think
she used the word "pussy," though.

595
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,643
Was someone looking
for a date to Gustav's party?

596
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,855
l will totally look hot for you.

597
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,149
You'll shit when you see what l'm wearing.

598
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:40,236
Please, l'll be super classy.

599
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,197
This is cute. Right?

600
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,740
This works.

601
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,743
Yeah. Yeah. ls the party in 1 989?

602
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:50,329
Do you have a cocktail dress
that l can borrow?

603
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,374
-Yes, l do, but l'm wearing it tonight.
-For what?

604
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,168
-For date night.
-What?

605
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,378
No, Dani's coming with me tonight.

606
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,756
What? So l'm the third wheel on a dad date.

607
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:01,841
Sorry.

608
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:02,925
The horror.

609
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,554
She woke up all warm and fuzzy this morning
and suggested we have a fancy dinner.

610
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,598
Maybe she's happier
'cause you're here.

611
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,558
No, it's definitely not that.

612
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:16,814
Hey, Pippa is like,
you know, a fashiony-type person.

613
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,608
-Yeah?
-You can borrow something from her.

614
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,486
l mean, she owes me one
for letting her shower here.

615
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,906
What an excellent and awkward idea.

616
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:27,658
-Hi.
-Allo.

617
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,827
-Hello there.
-How are you?

618
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,078
Hey. Hi.

619
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,916
Listen, we have a fashion emergency

620
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,836
and we would like your help, my lady.

621
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:43,007
A fashion emergency.
Yes, absolutely. l can help you.

622
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,301
l never would have expected
that coming from you.

623
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,802
-lt's for... Yes.
-You.

624
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,262
That's a lot easier.

625
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,933
No, no, no. Sorry. That was not clear.

626
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,059
l'm good.

627
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,269
Absolutely. l can totally help you.

628
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,605
Great. Chim-chimeree.

629
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,778
Any more primping,
the girls are gonna cry with jealousy.

630
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,405
Well, then you're just gonna have to kiss
this lipstick off me.

631
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,115
lf you insist, l guess.

632
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,205
Hey, honey. l'm really touched
you took my advice

633
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,831
to include the girls tonight.

634
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,376
l can't say no to you, can l?

635
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:19,919
Nope.

636
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:32,223
Whoa! You look like somebody else.

637
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,225
Are you serious? Thanks.

638
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,103
All right. Where's Dani?

639
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,563
Late. What else is new?

640
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,815
Well, use protection, okay?

641
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,899
l will.

642
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:45,570
l have my diaphragm in.

643
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,035
-Hi.
-Hi.

644
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,749
This chair, it always sticks like that.

645
00:31:58,834 --> 00:31:59,875
Can you get in there?

646
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,795
Watch the leather.
Just be a little graceful, okay?

647
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,879
-Sorry.
-Where's Dani?

648
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,172
She's not coming.

649
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,882
You look nice, Carol.

650
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:07,925
Thank you.

651
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,093
She didn't say anything to me about it.

652
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,511
Well, she has work.

653
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:14,515
Of course, l told you, remember?
l said exactly this would happen.

654
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,058
-Would you like a Life Saver?
-lt's just predictable.

655
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:18,936
lt's tiresome.
lt's predictable, the same thing all the time.

656
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,905
lt's a lot stuffier than l remember.

657
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,116
Yeah, Gustav,
you got enough goddamn flowers?

658
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,744
Maybe he's covering the fact that he stinks.

659
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:35,953
Nice one, Meems.

660
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:37,413
Where is he, anyway?

661
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,915
Why are we talking about him
like we're in West Egg?

662
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,044
Oh, there he is. Mr. Big Pants.

663
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,925
Watch the door.
l just had it detailed. Watch the door.

664
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,178
-l'm trying my best. l'm fine.
-Watch your foot... Okay.

665
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:57,058
Dad? You know what, l'm just going to make
a phone call really quickly.

666
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,934
What phone call? We just got here.

667
00:32:59,019 --> 00:32:59,977
lt's going to be really quick...

668
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:01,979
Carol, you always do this. Come on.

669
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,939
Listen, make sure you find us
when you're done.

670
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,608
-All right?
-l will. l will.

671
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,947
Hello. Yes, l'd like a cab to Reseda.

672
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,325
How long is the wait on that ish?

673
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,495
-Carol, hey. How are you?
-Louis.

674
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,456
-Hi.
-Nancy is who l am.

675
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,957
Yes. This is true.

676
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,959
You look great.

677
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,503
Thank you so much.

678
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:28,673
Were you waiting for someone?
Or should we go in?

679
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,132
l'm just here with my dad.

680
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:33,219
-Oh, really! Let's go in.
-Yeah.

681
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:39,183
l was doing a gig, and we were like
on the 22nd take,

682
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,353
and so the producer says,
"On the next take

683
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,355
"can you give me a little bit more energy?"

684
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,982
And l said,
"Well, why don't you go back to take one."

685
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,986
You decided to come.

686
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,988
Oh, yeah. Nancy wanted to come.

687
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,990
l thought, you know,
"Maybe l'll run into a friend."

688
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:58,035
This place is rich. Drinks stat.

689
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,037
-You want to come?
-No. l'm good.

690
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,163
Are you sure?

691
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,958
Yeah. You go and get your drink on.

692
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:09,964
Used to be Don, Hal Douglas and Sam here
who had the lockdown on the epics.

693
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,800
Sam, you weren't doing epics
until Don passed.

694
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,969
l mean, no disrespect.

695
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,220
None taken.

696
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,181
By the way, how's the Just for Men
working out for you?

697
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:23,936
Sam, by the way, congratulations
on the Lifetime Achievement Award.

698
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,021
That was very, very well-deserved, my friend.

699
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,565
Very kind of you,
l appreciate that.

700
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:28,983
lt is such an honor.

701
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,819
lt'll be a great way to get Sam's
whole family together.

702
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,821
Bittersweet, though, isn't it, Sotto?

703
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:38,451
l mean, you reach the peak of your success,
and you only have one way to fall.

704
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,579
Listen, you're just on edge, Graue,
because you're getting old

705
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,290
and Gustav's closing in
on that "ln a world..." gig.

706
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,041
-Well, let's hope so.
-l'm not sure about that.

707
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,002
l think that they're gonna
make you fight for it.

708
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,296
l'm surprised they didn't go to you
on this one, Sam.

709
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,507
Well, gee, Marc, what makes you so sure
they didn't?

710
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,199
Wow. That is not feminine.

711
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,290
Gym bag.

712
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,168
That's your spot. Always has been.

713
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,549
-Pretty cool, right?
-Yeah, it's impressive.

714
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,093
What part? The map? Or the world?

715
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,095
You know, both are good.

716
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,224
That's correct. Both are good.
Gustav Warner.

717
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,059
Yeah, l know. l know. This is your...

718
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,143
My house and my party.

719
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,896
l don't know who you are.
Would you care to indulge me?

720
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,440
-l'm Carol Solomon.
-Carol Solomon. You're very pretty.

721
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,317
What?

722
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,653
You're very pretty. You're really, really pretty.

723
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:59,740
l saw you come in with some randoms
and l've been clocking you out all night.

724
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,577
You're just really pretty.
l just wanted to tell you that.

725
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:04,995
Thank you.

726
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,914
You don't have to return the compliment.

727
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,791
l get it. l have a face for radio.

728
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,544
But enjoy the map. Or the world.

729
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,842
-Mimi?
-Alla?

730
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:21,345
What are you doing here?
-My god, what are you doing here?

731
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,473
l am working here dummy.
-So, is he a good boss?

732
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,770
He can be a shit, but he overpays me
so who gives a fuck!

733
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,481
Jesus.

734
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,154
Bye!

735
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:41,532
Amazing, right?

736
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,618
You got to take that thing out of here
before she strains her milk.

737
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,963
Oh, no! Oh, sorry!

738
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,143
Could l just have a water?

739
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,439
lt's me again. Same message.

740
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,331
Let's see what you got, mate.

741
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,677
Just people who have a flustered vendetta
for the unavoidable.

742
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,470
And you, actually.

743
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:13,892
Yes! You make me laugh.
Just looking at you.

744
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,353
l'm sure you're a strong woman.

745
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:18,397
And you're a toughie with your friends.

746
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,441
But l'm looking at you now,

747
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,069
and you're shakin' in your knickers
like a little girl.

748
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:28,365
l just wish l could do something
to make you feel more comfortable.

749
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:35,122
l'm fine. l'm not shaking in anything.
So comfortable.

750
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,166
Do you have a boyfriend?

751
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,003
No.

752
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:08,655
Hello, nosy.

753
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,782
Hey! God!

754
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,911
l'm sorry. l'm in this...

755
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:19,249
l'm really sorry about being here.
This is clearly off-limits to guests.

756
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,044
Oh, no, no.
All of my guests have left at this point.

757
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,253
They have?

758
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,006
So either you're an intruder,
a figment of my imagination

759
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,382
or you're my new roommate.

760
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:30,302
l would be your roommate
if l could live in this room.

761
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,387
This is really... This is cool.

762
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,640
l built this special room for me.

763
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,600
This is my private space.

764
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,393
Oh, sorry.

765
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,562
-l'm glad you like it.
-l like it.

766
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,774
My parents died when l was very young,

767
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,444
and they left me a large inheritance

768
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:50,697
and l used that to travel the world,
so l never went to college.

769
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:58,288
l guess you can say that
culture was my education.

770
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,167
But now,

771
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:06,255
whenever l find myself
wrapped up in the industry,

772
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,423
l know this sounds crazy,

773
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:12,511
but l like to come to this room,
take off all my clothes,

774
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:18,517
and just remember what it feels like
to be uncomfortable.

775
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,188
l'm only telling you this because
there's something about you

776
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:24,481
that reminds me of me.

777
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:28,694
You know?

778
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,487
l'm sorry, l don't mean to unload
all of that on you.

779
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,490
lt's just that l look at you in this space
and you're so pretty.

780
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,163
And l just want to kiss you right now.

781
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,485
Sweetie, l am so sorry

782
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,488
that our entire date night got totally
screwed up.

783
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:17,451
Lizzie's nephew had some kind
of procedure or something.

784
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,494
l don't know. He's like a kid to her.

785
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,496
So she wanted me to cover for her
'cause her sister,

786
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:26,001
whatever, is like, in AA,
or she now is in AA,

787
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,378
and everybody's trying to clean up
over there.

788
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,838
And she had to take care of him.

789
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,257
l guess we could just go get Greek food
if you want.

790
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:34,343
Get takeout because they're gonna...

791
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:35,510
But l'm looking at you now,

792
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,639
and you're shakin' in your knickers
like a little girl.

793
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,573
l found it behind the sink.

794
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:14,675
Wait.

795
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:37,049
Hey.

796
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,686
lt's a nice day, huh?

797
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,775
Thank you.

798
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,153
lt was really...

799
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,698
Nice.

800
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:05,702
Oh, my God!

801
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:09,373
Did we sleep together?

802
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,457
No.

803
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,044
Did l sleep with anyone?

804
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,128
Nope.

805
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,005
Who did you sleep with?

806
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:18,507
Nobody.

807
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,386
HeIIo, BeII Cab.

808
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,887
-Yeah, hi, can l get a taxi cab...
-Please hold.

809
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,013
Yeah, l'll hold.

810
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,225
l'm just going to use your bathroom.

811
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,730
Sorry about your sheets.

812
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:39,027
Guess who's a slutty whore?

813
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,196
Dani?

814
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:47,160
Danielle? What's going on?
Are you okay?

815
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,830
What's wrong?

816
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:55,836
Okay.

817
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:58,922
So where were you last night, man?
l didn't see you.

818
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,259
No, l was talking to some redhead
with a shitty voice but a killer rack.

819
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,344
l know who you're talking about.

820
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,513
Yeah, so, what's the word, chief?

821
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,223
Listen, l got a little gossip for you.

822
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,142
l found out the name of the broad
who snagged that gig.

823
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:11,226
Spill it.

824
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,311
Forget it. She's a nobody.
She's a two-bit vocal coach.

825
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,522
But now, she booked two more
movie trailer gigs.

826
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:17,816
Get this.
They're all children's movies, but still.

827
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,734
Her name's Carol Solomon.

828
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:20,819
What?

829
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,738
Carol Solomon.
She's not gonna keep working,

830
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,740
if l have anything to do with it. Little thief!

831
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:27,075
She was at the party.

832
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,202
What're you talking about?
Who fucking brought her?

833
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:30,662
l don't know.

834
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:33,748
He came in
and he walked up with this puppy.

835
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,293
He gave Erin a puppy?
What kind of puppy?

836
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,587
l didn't even sleep with
the stupid lrish schmuck.

837
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,754
Are you serious?

838
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,174
-Not that it matters. lt doesn't matter.
-lt does matter, Dani.

839
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,968
That makes it... lt's a gray area,
but l think that makes it a lot less...

840
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,386
No, we just kissed.

841
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:47,804
That's pennies.

842
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:51,725
And then l ran out of the room.
We made out for like 25 minutes.

843
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:52,893
That's not hideous.

844
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,270
-He tried to put the tip in.
-Okay.

845
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,814
-l wouldn't let him put the tip in.
-Yeah, that is...

846
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,484
You're not gonna win an award
with that one.

847
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,194
You can't tell... You can say, "Moe.

848
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,154
"He tried to put the tip in,
but l didn't let him."

849
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,209
Sister code.

850
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,755
Did you sleep with him?

851
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:23,673
lt's okay.

852
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:25,634
Sister code?

853
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,303
l didn't.

854
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,805
l do not believe you!

855
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,891
l can't believe we're still on this.

856
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,185
lt wasn't even my idea
to bring her to the party.

857
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,396
Oh, no? Sorry.
Why were you late to work yesterday?

858
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:39,856
Because l slept in!

859
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,733
And l couldn't wake her up and get her out
of my apartment!

860
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,859
Oh, sleepy.

861
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:44,194
Okay. One more time, guys.

862
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,112
l'm going to keep it open this time, all right?

863
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,282
Nancy is a volcano of sensuality,

864
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,159
you could have experienced her eruption.

865
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,286
Volcanoes kill people, Cher.

866
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,455
You're just miffed about Carol.

867
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:57,082
What about Carol?

868
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,334
What? l thought you'd tell him.

869
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:00,919
Tell me what?

870
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:04,965
Mimi knows Gustav's maid, Alla,

871
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,175
because the Russian community
is very interconnected.

872
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,426
Okay. So what'd she say?

873
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,641
She said that Carol
spent the night at Gustav's.

874
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,226
So l guess they...

875
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,816
Cut!

876
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,569
Okay, let's go again.
lt's a police station, remember. Okay?

877
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,863
Less restaurant hubbub and more
aggro conversation in the background.

878
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,700
Snacks, take it to the kitchen,
for Christ's sake!

879
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,243
Sorry.

880
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:40,000
l'm sure they probably just did oral.

881
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,631
l noticed you had some fine-looking girls
there at the party.

882
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:50,343
There was this one girl that l took down.

883
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:53,388
At first glance, you look at her,
l thought her face was kind of rough.

884
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:56,891
But at second glance, whoa! She's super hot.

885
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:59,227
And she was a crasher
so she was a little feisty,

886
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:00,437
-if you know what l mean?
-Yeah.

887
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:03,690
She let me rip her panties off
as soon as l stuck my tongue in her mouth.

888
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,901
Holy cow! Man, you got lucky, kid!
You sound like me!

889
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,028
And here's the crazy thing.

890
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,447
She is the chick who snagged
the gig from me!

891
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:11,906
No shit!

892
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,908
She is the chick who snagged
the gig from me.

893
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:14,993
-You're kidding me.
-No.

894
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,163
Well, you showed her who's the boss,
didn't you? You're the boss!

895
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:19,873
Hey, man! l'm the boss!

896
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,043
lt doesn't matter. l'll never see her again.
So whatever. You know what l mean?

897
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:25,879
No, no. She bitch-slapped you
by stealing that gig from you.

898
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,923
l think you should have a little fun.
Play this vixen out. You understand?

899
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:33,970
After all, it's her fault
for messing with the scorpion. Am l right?

900
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:36,723
-Am l right?
-Yes, you are right, Sam.

901
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:39,559
Give her the stinger! Once more from me,
if you don't mind.

902
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,564
Unknown number? Hello.

903
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:46,399
-Gotcha.
-Who is this?

904
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:50,111
Come on. You should recognize my voice.
After all, most of the country does.

905
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:53,948
-Mr. Warner.
-That's right.

906
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:57,243
Yeah, l can't talk right now
'cause l have to go to work.

907
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,038
Oh, really?
You snaking another one of my jobs?

908
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,540
What are you? A detective?

909
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:06,836
No. But l'll search you anyway.

910
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,005
You're cheesy.

911
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,632
Hey, come on. You're laughing.

912
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,261
To answer your question, no,
l'm not stealing anything.

913
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,681
lt's a job that was offered directly to me.

914
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:18,973
Oh! Well, break a lung.

915
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,308
Thanks, l won't.

916
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:22,352
Bye, Carol Solomon.

917
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,021
l'm the boss.

918
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,984
The new Saber Tooth
bristle brush technology

919
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:34,698
is patented to be soft on hair,
hard on fly-aways.

920
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:39,494
Saber Tooth. Because nobody's purrr-fect.

921
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,124
So where's Louis?

922
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,543
-He's sick and went home early.
-He doesn't want to see you.

923
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,503
-What?
-Not what l said.

924
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,672
l heard through the grapevine

925
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,425
they want you to V.O. the promo
for that crazy trilogy.

926
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,760
And don't bust me for dropping
the broccoli.

927
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,137
What crazy trilogy?

928
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,764
Oh, my God, The Amazon Games!

929
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,474
How could you not have heard of this?

930
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,976
lt's common pop knowledge.

931
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,185
l don't have an agent.

932
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,896
First off, it's a quadrilogy.

933
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,022
Great.

934
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:11,025
lt's an adaptation of
the hyper fantasy book series.

935
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,320
lt's about these fierce mutated female
Amazonian warriors

936
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:19,325
as the sole future world-inhabiting species
battling cloned prehistoric cavemen hybrids.

937
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,077
lt's all based on the Prussian War.

938
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:27,041
Anyway, they're reinstating the hokey
"ln a world..." gimmick

939
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,585
and everybody's in a huff, l guess.

940
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,920
Because it marks the rebirth of epic cinema!

941
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,172
Whatever.

942
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,008
l'm just glad it's a woman this time
instead of a sweaty old man.

943
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,176
l'll see you guys.

944
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,260
Yeah. Congrats.

945
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,387
Thank you for dropping the broccoli.

946
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:42,056
You should cut your hair.

947
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:45,602
Stop trying to woo me by being mean.
lt doesn't work.

948
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:47,437
You want to get a drink later?

949
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:48,646
Okay.

950
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:53,693
Hey! Watch it!

951
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,862
That is so rude.

952
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,071
Excuse me. l'm so sorry.

953
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,615
l just want to give you my card.

954
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:01,159
l'm not a vocal coach anymore,
but l would make an exception for you

955
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,702
because you sound like a squeaky toy.

956
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,370
And l don't mean that in a bad way.

957
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,248
l think you're better than that.
And l think we're all better than that.

958
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,042
lt's good for the species.
You know what l mean?

959
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,544
There's also a Jamba Juice
two blocks away from here.

960
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,379
'Cause l bet you were looking for a smoothie.

961
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,965
Maybe not. l don't know. But if you were,

962
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,592
you know where it is.

963
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,851
Excited or farting?

964
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,066
How are you?

965
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,152
l just came back to get my cell phone.

966
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:39,280
There is no way to function in
the modern world without one.

967
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,158
Yeah. No, l know it.

968
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,829
Do you want to talk about anything or...

969
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:49,207
-There's nothing you can say, Carol.
-Right. l know. l know.

970
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,254
l wish that there was

971
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,590
a bubble or something, you know,

972
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,093
that we could just step into

973
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:03,555
where there was no judgment
or past or present.

974
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:10,353
A bubble where l can hear her say

975
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:14,190
why she did it in a vortex.

976
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:21,364
Sort of. Yeah. Not the bubble part of it,
but the general...

977
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,659
Listen, l'm staying at my friend PJ's
editing suite,

978
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,452
-'cause l got a lot of deadlines.
-PJ?

979
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,162
And he's got a comfy couch

980
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,956
and this stupid yellow lab
that definitely thinks

981
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,249
l'm the best person that ever lived.

982
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,668
PJ who, though? Just so l know...

983
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,670
l really gotta be away
from everything right now. Okay?

984
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:36,754
Okay.

985
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,551
Hey. l got good news.

986
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,052
What?

987
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,640
Dinner at Dad's tonight.
The groupie's making casseroles.

988
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,475
l'm ignoring that.

989
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:52,478
Come on. Yum-yum.

990
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,981
Hamburger hash.

991
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:02,238
Have you spoken to Moe?

992
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:12,790
l feel so lost without him.

993
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:18,671
Like l can't even tell him,
you know? Because...

994
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,011
l know. l know. lf you could... lf you could...

995
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:30,475
lf you could tell him, what would you say?

996
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:36,522
ln a way, that's kind of a good...
lt's a good exercise

997
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:41,110
to just let it out. Just let it flow.

998
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,988
Whatever you want to say.

999
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:46,032
-l am. Carol.
-Okay.

1000
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,116
Jesus.

1001
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:52,246
lt's just that nobody takes care of me
the way that he does.

1002
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,916
l just feel really safe with him.

1003
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,879
The only thing l gave him in return
is total dishonesty.

1004
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:03,299
lt doesn't even matter that l didn't sleep
with that asshole, right?

1005
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:05,802
-Tip or no tip.
-Tip, as in "gratuity"?

1006
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:10,264
God! l should not even have been in his
room in the first place.

1007
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:13,977
l hate myself. l hate myself.

1008
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:16,270
l hate myself for doing that.

1009
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:19,232
l hate myself for squandering
the most beautiful thing

1010
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,401
l ever had in my whole stupid life.

1011
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:30,952
l'm so scared.
l'm so scared, Carol, that l'm gonna lose him.

1012
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:36,708
And l'm so sad because
l'm not good enough for him

1013
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:38,793
and l don't deserve him.

1014
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:42,422
And l don't deserve his sandwich bar.

1015
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:49,637
Who's that hot friend of Moe's?

1016
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:54,434
Named PJ?

1017
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,354
'Cause l kinda want to date him.

1018
00:55:58,939 --> 00:55:59,939
Wait, what?

1019
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:02,316
PJ?

1020
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:04,527
PJ Koopchick?

1021
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:08,948
PJ Koopchick. l think it was, yeah,
PJ Koopchick.

1022
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,324
He's married.

1023
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:15,121
Oh, my God! PJ Koopchick's married?
Jesus, another good one gone.

1024
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,373
He's really fat. Hairy.

1025
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:22,670
Yeah. l know. You know l like that. Like Dad.

1026
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:27,759
That's literally why l was always into
PJ Koopchick.

1027
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:33,890
What are these?

1028
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,433
Oh, they're just cherries from a can.

1029
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,559
From Canter's.

1030
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,394
No, l made it.

1031
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:41,731
Just kidding.
lt's as Jewish as you can get in her family.

1032
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,984
That's a good one.

1033
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,403
Listen, l wanted to show you something.

1034
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:50,948
l came across this article l wrote
decades ago.

1035
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:56,287
l think it's worth a read.
Have a look at it. lt's all about goals.

1036
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,082
l wish l could write.
Your father's book was so...

1037
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,166
l'll give it to you after.

1038
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,418
l'm no Philip Roth, but l try.

1039
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,087
Dani was always a really good writer.

1040
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:05,463
You don't have to do that.

1041
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,340
lt must run in the family.

1042
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:10,635
My aunt Peggy writes a column
for health journal in Ohio.

1043
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,179
But she's not really related to me, 'cause
it's my mom's brother's wife.

1044
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,891
You kids with your phones.

1045
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,518
That is what l'm talking about.

1046
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,228
Oh, look at these.
They're almost too pretty to eat.

1047
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:23,231
So, how's the Moe situation?

1048
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,402
Listen. We're all family here.

1049
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,154
l think we can look to each other
for strength.

1050
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,447
Oh, my God!

1051
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:33,950
Jamie, l think, could be real helpful
in this situation.

1052
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,285
l actually have to run to the little girls' room.
Excuse me.

1053
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,495
"How's the Moe situation?"

1054
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,413
Listen, Dani. Let me tell you something.

1055
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,415
l don't think you did anything wrong.

1056
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,625
Oh, okay. Thanks, Dad.

1057
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,502
No, l mean it. Moe's gonna get over this.

1058
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,254
Okay. l'm sure.

1059
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,881
You know, people make mistakes in life.
l know l have.

1060
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:53,427
Marriage is all about forgiveness.
Your mother understood that.

1061
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,263
Yeah! Mom totally understood that.

1062
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:56,430
She understood it completely.

1063
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:59,433
l mean, she did OD on the prescription
meds that she had to take

1064
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,435
to deal with the anxiety that you caused her.

1065
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,146
ln the first place, let me explain something.

1066
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,397
l don't want to split hairs, Dad.

1067
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,440
Your mother had a deep affection
for Sudafed,

1068
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:09,152
which accidentally interfered
with her love affair with Valium.

1069
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:10,444
lt was Xanax. lt was definitely Xanax.

1070
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:11,571
Don't start!

1071
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:14,115
She was going out with Howard Wetson
when she died!

1072
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,659
At least Howard Wetson
knows l don't like bell peppers!

1073
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,871
For Christ's sake, it was 1 6 years ago.
Would you let it pass?

1074
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:23,791
Jesus Christ. The moment l find one little
iota of happiness

1075
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,460
the two of you have to start blaming
your mother's death on me.

1076
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:29,505
-No one's blaming you, okay?
-Don't be so crass.

1077
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,424
You're blaming yourself!

1078
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,969
So Mom died. Do we need to rehash that?

1079
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,762
l feel like we really got into...

1080
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,181
Here, Jamie, try some of these.
They're very good.

1081
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:39,557
l don't want to eat them all myself.

1082
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,643
l already had one, but, yeah,
they're pretty good.

1083
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,103
So, l have news.

1084
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:46,814
What news? You're not pregnant, are you?

1085
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,357
All we need.

1086
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:49,483
Oh, l'm just kidding.

1087
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:51,485
No, l've been working.

1088
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,905
-The vocal coaching, right?
-Terrific, yeah.

1089
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:58,326
No, no. l just booked these two voice over...
Like, movie trailer voice over gigs.

1090
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,454
And l wanted to share that with you
because it all started

1091
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,373
because l swiped this really big job
from Gustav Warner,

1092
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:07,251
who l finally met at the party you guys
brought me to.

1093
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:11,839
And now l'm going to be the voice
of this new epic quadrilogy.

1094
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:15,176
And l get to be the first woman to utter
the words "ln a world..."

1095
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:16,677
Sam!

1096
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:19,263
-Are you okay?
-Dad, have some water.

1097
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:23,434
Excuse me. Wait a second.
That's you? You're the thief?

1098
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:25,519
The what?

1099
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,521
"The thief," it sounds like a crime novel.

1100
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:29,106
You're dating Gustav Warner?

1101
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,608
Wait. How do you know about that?

1102
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,568
lt's more like fucking probably
than l would say dating.

1103
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:35,404
Jesus Christ!
Why don't you tell me any of this stuff?

1104
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:37,365
You don't ask about the stuff.

1105
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:39,075
You don't ever ask about us or anything.

1106
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:41,953
Sam, a daughter should not have to share
her sex life with her father.

1107
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:43,663
Yes, thank you, Jamie. l appreciate it.

1108
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:48,376
Listen, sweetheart, let me explain something
to you, okay? This is a business.

1109
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,796
An industry you've seen from
arm's length for your entire life.

1110
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,922
And there's a reason for that.

1111
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:57,134
You don't just put one promo,
one trailer on your ré‎sumé‎

1112
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,262
and expect to get
a gigantic job like that.

1113
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:02,848
l've booked, actually, three movie trailer
gigs and then now this quadrilogy.

1114
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,767
You have to understand
something, sweetheart.

1115
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,686
They would never try and resurrect

1116
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:11,107
something this important,
this iconic with a freshman vocal.

1117
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:14,610
lt's not done.

1118
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,615
Well, l think l could go for some
of that nice green tea.

1119
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,033
Could we have some of that?

1120
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:23,160
l don't drink caffeine, remember?

1121
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:26,706
Yes. Clearly, l forgot about that, Jamie.

1122
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:28,666
Carol?

1123
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,584
-Can we go, please?
-Carol! Don't. Wait.

1124
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:31,961
-Do you want me to start it?
-Carol! Wait.

1125
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,129
-Do l have the keys?
-Carol, would you wait?

1126
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,172
l'm in my heels. l've been working all day.

1127
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:36,590
-l can't even walk.
-l'm sorry.

1128
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:40,136
l don't believe him.
l think he's lying about the whole quadrilogy.

1129
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,722
lt's fine. He's a legend.
lt makes sense they would give him the line.

1130
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:43,848
l call bullshit. l call bullshit.

1131
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:47,601
Because that man cannot let anybody
in this whole goddamn family shine

1132
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:49,979
because Nana was a cunt to him
when he was a little kid.

1133
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,731
Nana was a survivor.
You should be easy on Nana.

1134
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,607
Yeah, right. You know what?
You gotta believe me.

1135
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:56,610
You cannot expect that man
to ever be supportive of you.

1136
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:58,612
He is totally incapable of that.

1137
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:01,115
l think the studio is going to be very
pleased to learn

1138
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,951
that l've been reconsidering
and now l'm very much interested

1139
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:05,494
in doing the quadrilogy gig.

1140
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:06,829
For what? The Amazon Games?

1141
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:07,997
Exactly.

1142
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,123
Sam, it's too Iate.

1143
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,249
What do you mean, "Too late"?

1144
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:11,751
How am l supposed to tell them to recast it?

1145
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:14,587
Because l'm Sam goddamn Sotto.
That's why.

1146
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:15,838
The studio wants Carol.

1147
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:20,426
l suppose you can put yourself on tape.
Give it a shot.

1148
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:22,136
Very well then. So be it. Okay.

1149
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:26,307
ln that case, l will put myself on tape
with everybody else.

1150
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:28,726
And l will conquer.

1151
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:32,646
Alla! Before you leave make me one more
of those soy white Russians.

1152
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:33,898
l'm sorry, Siegel. What were you saying?

1153
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:36,484
You're not gonna believe this,
but Sotto, he's back in.

1154
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:37,651
To what? Amazon Games?

1155
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:39,653
Your girlfriend's not the only one
to beat out now.

1156
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:41,697
The legend himself? Are you kidding me?

1157
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:43,657
l thought you guys were pals?

1158
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:44,784
Yeah, so did l.

1159
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:48,788
You're not gonna be able to screw yourself
out of a voice over battle with Sotto.

1160
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,757
"Better than a bubble."

1161
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:04,845
How am l gonna play this?

1162
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,943
Hey.

1163
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,529
Your voice sounds bad. Are you sick?

1164
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:25,616
Oh, no. l just woke up

1165
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,244
'cause l was up talking to my sister till late.

1166
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,664
Right, where are you now?

1167
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,708
l'm at my sister's place in Koreatown.

1168
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:36,085
Yeah, Koreatown. That's funny

1169
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:40,506
because l'm right in your neighborhood.
l'm pretty much right near you right now.

1170
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,758
Hey! Why don't we get a snack?

1171
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:44,677
Let's get a snack.

1172
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,761
All right.

1173
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:51,392
But l'm gonna need a second to spiff up.

1174
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,686
Totally. You know what?
You take a couple of minutes.

1175
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,730
You know, l'll just text you where l am
and just meet me downstairs

1176
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,357
and then we'll figure it out.

1177
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:03,904
l'm sorry.

1178
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,489
l'm good. That's cool.

1179
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:08,200
l got you a hot water with lemon.

1180
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,453
Gargle that.

1181
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:12,746
Oh, l'm good on the gargle.

1182
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:13,914
-Sure. Whatever.
-Thank you.

1183
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,708
You want to take a walk?

1184
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:16,917
Sure.

1185
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:25,759
Okay, here's the deal. My life consists
mainly of work, family, fantasy baseball.

1186
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:27,720
You do that? l didn't know you did that.

1187
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,597
-Yeah, Rotisserie League with my friends.
-Oh, right on.

1188
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:33,267
l'm not a meddler, okay? But l like you.

1189
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,727
So when l heard something about you...

1190
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,145
What did you hear about me?

1191
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:37,771
l'm not done with my speech here.

1192
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:39,523
Oh, l didn't know there was a speech.

1193
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:41,317
Yes, it's a pitch. To be precise.

1194
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,485
ls that a baseball reference?

1195
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:43,777
No, no. lt's a literal pitch,

1196
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:46,113
like l want to pitch you an idea
kind of thing, okay?

1197
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:47,948
So, l grew up with three sisters.

1198
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,825
So l've always been into women's rights.

1199
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:52,495
And l listen to the Cranberries openly.

1200
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,079
Oh, what about Zombie or Linger?

1201
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,040
Linger. l like Linger better.

1202
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:57,958
Really? l would have pegged you
as a Zombie.

1203
01:03:58,043 --> 01:03:59,752
-Okay, can l finish?
-Yeah.

1204
01:03:59,878 --> 01:04:02,630
l'm really excited about you doing
the quadrilogy job, okay.

1205
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,590
lt's a big deal for a woman to be considered
for that job.

1206
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:07,551
No, l know, l guess Cher must've
had that wrong, l don't know.

1207
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,345
-No, she didn't.
-Yeah.

1208
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:12,348
No, no. Gustav was up for it
because the director wanted him,

1209
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:16,143
but then when that executive heard
your voice, the job was yours.

1210
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,979
-But now that your dad's back in...
-What do you mean he's back in?

1211
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,981
-What? l thought you knew.
-No.

1212
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:24,610
As of last night, his reps are pushing for him
to be considered for it.

1213
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:27,112
So now the studio feels like
they have choices.

1214
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,198
Each person is responsible
for recording and mixing

1215
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,991
their own audition, which is due tomorrow.

1216
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:32,785
And l'd love to help you with that.

1217
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,246
l gotta go back 'cause l gotta talk to Dani.

1218
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,122
Danny? Who's Danny? Do you like him?

1219
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,875
No, Dani's my sister.
l was gonna see her before l....

1220
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:45,965
What is the matter with you?

1221
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,633
l'm sorry. l was trying to get your attention.

1222
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:48,759
My mom has ADHD and it's like...

1223
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,302
lt's called positive road blocking.

1224
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:53,138
lt's just a way to kind of like jolt somebody
into like focusing.

1225
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,849
Can l just finish my mission here?

1226
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:57,059
Yes.

1227
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,144
Positive...

1228
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:01,063
-Look.
-What?

1229
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,983
l like you. l really like you.

1230
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:06,402
l know you're seeing Gustav Warner
right now and l just...

1231
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,612
How does everybody know about that?
l don't understand.

1232
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:09,863
The Russian community is really tight.

1233
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:13,242
The point is this.
Gustav's housekeeper Alla

1234
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,619
told Heners' wife Mimi that Gustav
just slept with you

1235
01:05:15,704 --> 01:05:16,829
to push you off your game.

1236
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:20,374
He doesn't even consider you
a real threat for the job.

1237
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:23,335
Now l say screw that wet lettuce piece of shit.

1238
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:24,712
Let's step up to the plate.

1239
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:26,505
lt's the bottom of the ninth,
the bases are loaded.

1240
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,882
Let's give the voice over industry
something to talk about here.

1241
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:30,342
What do you say?

1242
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,886
l'm sorry. Got carried away there.

1243
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:35,889
You surprised me, Louis. God.

1244
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:38,726
-Yeah?
-Yeah. lt was a good pitch.

1245
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:41,854
Was it? Good.
'Cause l actually did rehearse it.

1246
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,149
l like you, too.

1247
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,153
What?

1248
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,155
l do.

1249
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,034
She likes me.

1250
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,454
All right.

1251
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,496
Sandwich bar!

1252
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,759
Watch your step.

1253
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:58,472
Louis, thank you so much for letting me
stay here.

1254
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:01,934
l appreciate it. My sister and her husband
needed some emergency alone time.

1255
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,018
Watch out for that.

1256
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:06,063
Hey, no sweat. lt's my pleasure.

1257
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:08,607
Welcome, welcome.

1258
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:09,983
This is cool.

1259
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,110
-You like it?
-Yeah.

1260
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:12,361
Well, l finally got you here.

1261
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,988
l mean as much as we've known
each other for a while.

1262
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:17,449
You've never been here before.
That's all l meant by that.

1263
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:19,868
Oh, wow. ls that a couch bed?

1264
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:20,994
Yeah.

1265
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,288
Oh, that's cool. lt looks great.
You're good at that.

1266
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:24,957
l find myself sleeping on the couch so much.

1267
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,792
Oh, no, that's too bad.

1268
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:27,918
You're in here, by the way.

1269
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,002
-Oh, no.
-Yes.

1270
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,254
No, no. That looks awesome.

1271
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:32,798
Look. l put waters next to the bed.

1272
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,259
-l happen to be a couch aficionado.
-l re-did the sheets.

1273
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:37,010
All clean sheets for you.

1274
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,095
-l can't.
-l insist. Come on.

1275
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:40,013
Tomorrow's game day.

1276
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,850
You're the athlete.
The athlete sleeps in the bed.

1277
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:47,688
The coach sleeps on the couch.
l insist. Sleep well. Okay?

1278
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:48,772
Okay.

1279
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:52,818
Was it something l said?

1280
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:55,612
Oh, hey, no. l was just trying
to give you privacy.

1281
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:57,281
Oh, okay.

1282
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,284
By the way, there's a switch
right next to the bed down there.

1283
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,995
lf you hit that switch when you want to
go to sleep,

1284
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,246
everything will go dark.

1285
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:06,707
l rigged all the lights into the one switch.

1286
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,085
Because l hate getting up
and it's like l'm already falling asleep,

1287
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:12,045
and l gotta walk across the room
and whatever.

1288
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:14,798
l'm not showing off.
l'm sure other people have done it, too.

1289
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,341
lt did take a lot of work actually.

1290
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,051
There was quite a bit of wiring involved.

1291
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:21,096
So, l'm gonna stop talking now
and we'll get some sleep.

1292
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:23,265
lf you need anything, coach on the couch.

1293
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,350
Okay. Coach on the couch.

1294
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,104
Oh! l'm naked!

1295
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,607
Just kidding. l'm not.

1296
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,986
-l got you.
-l didn't want to be inappropriate.

1297
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,613
-Thank you for the knock.
-Yes.

1298
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:42,117
Towels in the bathroom. Fresh.

1299
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:44,077
Great. Towels.

1300
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:45,913
Not the blue one. Don't use the blue one.

1301
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:47,915
The blue one.

1302
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,750
What's wrong with the blue one?

1303
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,382
ln case you can't get to sleep,

1304
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:00,427
l left some homeopathic sleeping pills
next to the water.

1305
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:04,681
How'd you know?

1306
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:07,476
l'm naturally intuitive.

1307
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:09,770
You went to what?

1308
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,104
Who is Viv?

1309
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:14,107
No, there's no Viv. l'm intuitive.

1310
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:17,694
Like a person who has intuition, it's the...

1311
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,614
l think it's the adjectival... lt doesn't matter.

1312
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:26,286
l just thought maybe it would be weird
sleeping in the same place

1313
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:28,872
since we've both admitted that we like
each other. You know?

1314
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,251
Yeah. lt is awkward sort of.

1315
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:36,129
Yeah.

1316
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:39,675
But now that we've acknowledged it,
it's not as weird, though. Right?

1317
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:45,931
Yeah.

1318
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,767
l'm gonna still take
one of these pills, though.

1319
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:51,186
All right. Get some sleep, okay?

1320
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,396
Yeah.

1321
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:55,148
Rest that voice.
We've got a big day tomorrow.

1322
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,400
l'm trying.

1323
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:42,863
We ride. We ride. We ride on a cushion of air.

1324
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,659
l thought you didn't eat meat.

1325
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:54,291
l don't. But on game day
you want to taste the blood, you know?

1326
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,228
l want you to wear this.

1327
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:18,231
Sweetie, let me alone. l need to do
my thing now. l have to concentrate.

1328
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:21,693
lt's my lucky scarf.
lt helped me through my surgery.

1329
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:24,071
Surgery? l didn't know you had any
kind of surgery.

1330
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,197
Corrective rhinoplasty.

1331
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:28,742
lt was so scary and this scarf
was my strength.

1332
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:32,287
Thank you, Jamie. l really appreciate it.

1333
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:34,247
You're welcome.

1334
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:36,166
-All right. Let's hit it.
-Okay!

1335

Here we go.

1336
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,296
Remember.
First the right button, then you slate.

1337
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:43,340
Right button. Okay.

1338
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:46,927
Check one.

1339
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,972
No, you push the button first, then you slate.

1340
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,390
Okay.

1341
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:53,934
Action.

-Just say "Take 1 ."
-Take 1 .

1343

Test 1 . This is Sam Sotto.

1345
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:04,027
That sounds real good.

1346
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:07,239
Sweetie, l'm in the middle of recording.
You have to keep absolute silence, okay?

1347
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:08,532
Okay, l didn't know.

1348
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,243
Once more. This time it's "Take 2,"
don't forget.

1349
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:12,411
Okay.

1350
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:19,334
-Take 1 ... Two! Take 2.
-Take 2.

1351
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,259
Excuse me.

1352
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:30,679
Hey, make sure your phone's turned off.
l think we're getting some feedback out here.

1353
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:34,391
Sorry.

1354
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:39,896
All right, Carol. Let me hear
your levels.

1355
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:41,273
Yeah, hold on.

1356
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:50,365
Testing, testing, one, two, three.
How does that sound?

1357
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:52,451
Good, sounds great.

1358
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:53,910
Okay.

1359
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:55,370
All right.

1360
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:58,415
The Amazon Games promo, take 1 .

1361
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,837
ln a world...

1362
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:08,008
Where a hybrid breed
of mutant male savages...

1363
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:12,929
Are feeding on the barren lands
of Mother Earth.

1364
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:18,894
A time where mankind
has been replaced by womankind.

1365
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:23,815
A battle of epic strength
will collapse a barbaric enemy.

1366
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:25,400
One woman...

1367
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:31,364
Dared to rise up and exceed
the boundaries of the impossible.

1368
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:35,994
From the literary phenomenon
that inspired a generation...

1369
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,413
Comes a quadrilogy...

1370
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:41,458
Of one brave warrior
who must fight for her land.

1373
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:52,469
lt's a broad new world.

1374
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:59,434
l cannot wait to see that movie.

1375
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:06,525
Oh, man.

1376
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:12,114
Oh, thanks for that, babe.
That was unbelievable.

1377
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,491
l don't understand why you think

1378
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:17,869
you have to deprive yourself
of pleasure before you perform.

1379
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,122
You were so tense.

1380
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:24,000
Now, now, Jamie.
They have to hear the sex in your voice.

1381
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:28,171
Oh, there's always sex in your voice, Sam.

1382
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,387
So, how do you feel?

1383
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,264
How do l feel? How do you feel?

1384
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:39,432
l feel awesome. l feel great.

1385
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,476
Cheers! Awesome.

1386
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,480
Seriously, like, you did awesome.
Congrats.

1387
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,690
Thanks.

1388
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:53,947
Hey, do you have to wake up early tomorrow?

1389
01:15:02,582 --> 01:15:04,499
Who?

1390
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,534
Carol Solomon, home safe.

1391
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:24,037
-Louis Parker. Thank you.
-Done.

1392
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,163
You're a great driver.

1393
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:26,539
l thank you. l wasn't...

1394
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:28,208
No, you're really good at it.

1395
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,293
l thought l was very good.
And l'm not drunk, BTW.

1396
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:33,213
-No. Of course. l get it.
-l don't even say BTW usually.

1397
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,548
The tiniest buzz. Potentially.

1398
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:37,550
Louis, can you come back though,
for a second.

1399
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:39,844
Come back.
l have one question for you.

1400
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,972
lt's a real quick Q.

1401
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,560
Do you have any more of those,
like, you know, those...

1402
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:48,687
Songs?

1403
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:51,731
No. The sleeping pills?

1404
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,318
No. Not on me.

1405
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:56,528
You know the ones?

1406
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,654
No, l'm sorry. Why?

1407
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,283
No. lt's just gonna be really hard for me

1408
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:04,869
to fall asleep after you kiss me.

1409
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,622
lt's gonna be really hard.

1410
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:34,566
She's the whistleblower.

1411
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:36,276
Or the confronter.

1412
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,988
Guys! How many hours
of this crap can you watch?

1413
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,489
Honey, you look so cute.

1414
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:42,615
Who died?

1415
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,742
Give me a kiss.

1416
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:46,286
We're leaving for the Golden Trailer Awards
in 1 5 minutes!

1417
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,329
No, l can't.

1418
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:48,413
Dad can suck it.

1419
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,082
Your dad is winning
a Lifetime Achievement Award.

1420
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:53,585
You are his only family. We have tickets.

1421
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:57,047
You're going if l have to drag you.

1422
01:17:58,049 --> 01:18:00,967
l've a lot of important work
l've gotta do here.

1423
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:02,635
Jeff Garlin's hosting.

1424
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,637
This girl's a Daisy Whore.

1425
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:05,764
Let's go!

1426
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,767
Sweat pants off!

1427
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:13,229
Hey, do we have to do anything, if we
have these?

1428
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:16,399
-This is Sam Sotto's daughters right here.
-Shut up.

1429
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:21,613
l can't go in there. Literally, l'm humiliated.

1430
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,783
l'm not going in if you're not going in.

1431
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:27,744
Guys! Lifetime Achievement. Lifetime.

1432
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:30,163
You work your entire lifetime to win a
Golden Trailer

1433
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:33,083
for the Best Original Foreign Teaser Trailer.

1434
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:35,502
We are just thankful to be recognized.

1435
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:39,798
l love you, Tracy!

1436
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:42,717
How about that, huh?

1437
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:46,763
Before the show l saw the two of them
tossing a pumpkin backstage.

1438
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:52,685
Must be something they do in their
homeland. Just a warm-up.

1439
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:58,191
There's a big deal going on now with
the quadrilogy series.

1440
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:00,527
Quadrilogy, three books weren't enough.
Four!

1441
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:01,903
And they're making four movies

1442
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:05,115
and the first movie,
you're about to get a... You'll see.

1443
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:11,830
Please welcome the executive producer

1444
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,750
Thank you.

1445
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:19,963
This year, in honor of the late
Don LaFontaine,

1446
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:24,092
the Golden Trailer Awards
have deemed this the perfect occasion

1447
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:27,929
to unveil the first trailer
forThe Amazon Games.

1448
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,683
As you know,
Don coined those three little words

1449
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,519
that make this a truly epic promo.

1450
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:36,771
And one of which we can all be proud.

1451
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:38,898
So without further ado,

1452
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:41,985
take your first look at The Amazon Games.

1453
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:56,791
ln a world where a hybrid breed
of mutant male savages

1454
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:03,131
are feeding on the barren lands of
Mother Earth.

1455
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,383
l will avenge you.

1456
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:11,764
A time where mankind has been replaced
by womankind.

1457
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:16,519
A battle of epic strength

1458
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:20,940
will collapse a barbaric enemy.

1459
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:27,739
We will walk! We will run! But we will fight!

1460
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:37,123
Sam!

1461
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,793
One woman dared to rise up

1462
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:44,214
and exceed the boundaries
of the impossible.

1463
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:46,508
This land is ours!

1464
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:50,386
From the literary phenomenon
that inspired a generation

1465
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:53,264
comes the quadrilogy

1466
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,810
of one brave warrior
who must fight for her land.

1467
01:20:57,895 --> 01:20:59,771
The Amazon Games.

1468
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:09,906
Sammy, don't scream.
lt's bad for your larynx!

1469
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:13,826
Sam! You stop it right now!

1470
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:16,454
Oh, cork it, Jamie!

1471
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,792
Now, you listen to me, Samuel Solomon.

1472
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:24,546
l am my mother's daughter and you cannot
talk to me like that

1473
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,339
no matter how bad you're hurting.

1474
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:30,343
You buck up and be proud
of your daughter, damn it.

1475
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:45,024
Dad.

1476
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:54,075
Now when you're done standing there
crying and feeling sorry for yourself

1477
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,786
you are gonna go and apologize
to both your daughters

1478
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,204
for being such a jerk.

1479
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:00,665
Okay?

1480
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,917
And you're gonna be a good daddy
from now on

1481
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:07,088
or else you can say goodbye to me
and my perfect nose.

1482
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:13,595
You're a better man than you think, Sammy.

1483
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:17,265
Winning isn't everything. Family is.

1484
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:21,436
And being nice is a lot more fun. You'll see.

1485
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:33,865
Oh, my God! You're... Hi. l'm Carol Solomon.

1486
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:34,949
l know who you are.

1487
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:37,035
Of course you do. That's stupid.

1488
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:40,913
Listen, l want to take
this opportunity to thank you.

1489
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:42,915
l really appreciate you taking
a chance on me.

1490
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,211
l know you hire whoever's
best for the job, but l just...

1491
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:50,798
-Carol, let me level with you.
-lt's really special.

1492
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:55,928
Sure, you have perfect tone
and a strong sound

1493
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:57,347
that's a fitting choice for the genre.

1494
01:22:57,723 --> 01:22:58,931
Oh, thanks.

1495
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:03,227
But l'm using you for a bigger purpose.

1496
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:09,942
This pseudo-feminist fantasy tween
chick-lit bullshit

1497
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:13,196
is a devolution of the female mission.

1498
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:16,115
lt's cancerous to the intelligence
of young women.

1499
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:19,410
You got this job because
whether the general public

1500
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:23,665
chooses to acknowledge it or not,
voice over matters.

1501
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:26,959
Everyone in the world watches movie trailers.

1502
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:30,963
Everyone in the world sees commercials
on television.

1503
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:36,052
Or they hear them on the radio.
And that is power!

1504
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:45,019
Look, this quadrilogy is going to make
billions of dollars

1505
01:23:45,104 --> 01:23:51,067
and your voice is going to be the one
to inspire every girl who hears it.

1506
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:54,112
And that's why l chose you.

1507
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,031
Not because you were the best for the job.

1508
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:59,200
Because frankly, you weren't.

1509
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:04,080
l bet your dad is proud.

1510
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:13,005
Okay. You're gonna be great.

1511
01:24:18,095 --> 01:24:19,387
You screwed me over.

1512
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:22,473
You screwed my daughter.

1513
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,642
Yes, l did.

1514
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:25,893
l don't like him one bit.

1515
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:28,980
Which is partially a joke.
Really rubbed me the wrong way.

1516
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:32,734
But nonetheless, l'm going to introduce him.
Please welcome

1517
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,861
Gustav Warner, everybody.

1518
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:43,870
Thank you. Thank you.

1519
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:49,959
Tonight, one voice transcends
the very generation it represents.

1520
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:53,129
One voice soars above the rest.

1521
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:57,592
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor to present

1522
01:24:57,676 --> 01:25:02,680
the recipient of the Golden Trailer
Lifetime Achievement Award,

1523
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:04,766
Sam Sotto.

1524
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,149
Good job, Sam.

1525
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:27,371
l'm so very sorry.

1526
01:25:28,207 --> 01:25:34,170
My voice seems to have finally
thrown in the towel.

1527
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,215
l just wanted to...

1528
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,888
Well, l had you all going there for a minute,
didn't l?

1529
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:47,099
But in all sincerity,

1530
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:49,185
l just wanted to express

1531
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:54,690
how deeply grateful l am
for this tremendous accolade.

1532
01:25:55,776 --> 01:26:01,781
You know, a great voice isn't only a blessing,
it's also a choice.

1533
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:06,744
And l choose every day to be a part
of this great industry.

1534
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:11,123
Now, l'm not quite done
with my career yet,

1535
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:13,209
so don't get too excited, Gustav.

1536
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:18,965
But l'm proud to say

1537
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:21,926
that the tradition carries on.

1538
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:26,514
lt's surprising where some of our
new iconic voices will emerge from.

1539
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:31,185
You know,

1540
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:35,231
my father used to say to me,

1541
01:26:36,233 --> 01:26:38,234
"You're good, kid,

1542
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:41,237
"but as long as l'm around,

1543
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,240
"you'll never be as good as me."

1544
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:52,248
WeII, this award sure does make me feeI
pretty good.

1545
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:58,296
And so tonight
l'd like to dedicate this award

1546
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:06,637
to my daughters,
who make me very proud.

1547
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:15,646
Thank you.

1548
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:30,328
lt's a broad new world.

1549
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:34,332
All right. Thanks so much.

1550
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:39,503
So l shared that with all of you guys 'cause
l wanted to remind you

1551
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,505
why you're all here today.

1552
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:44,008
l guess let's start with Stacy.

1553
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:46,218
Stacy, what do you do for a living?

1554
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:48,220
l'm a corporate attorney.

1555
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:50,222
Great. And l know you've been on a job hunt.

1556
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:51,349
How's that going for you?

1557
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:55,770
l've been interviewing for about 1 0 months.

1558
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:57,772
And why do you think that is?

1559
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,107
Because l sound like a sexy baby.

1560
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,693
Which may be great for the bedroom.

1561
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:03,861
Yeah. lt is.

1562
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:09,200
But am l really going to hire a sexy baby

1563
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:12,244
to defend me in a patent infringement
lawsuit?

1564
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:13,454
Right. No.

1565
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,998
Over the next six weeks

1566
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:19,627
Louis will be recording your voices

1567
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:22,254
and we will listen to your sounds evolve.

1568
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:24,757
Right before your very ears.

1569
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:26,884
'Cause women should sound like women.

1570
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:30,763
Not baby dolls who end everything
in a question.

1571
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:33,307
Let's make a statement.

1572
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:36,394
Now, who's ready to be heard?

1573
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:43,275
Great, so what we're gonna
do is north-south-east-west.

1574
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,319
North-south-east-west.

1575
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:47,405
l'm gonna go say hi to them,
but keep it up.

1576
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,242
North-south-east-west.
