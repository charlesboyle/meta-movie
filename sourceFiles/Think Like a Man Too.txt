1
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,086
<i>Las Vegas.</i>

2
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,882
<i>For 100 years, people have flocked
to get a taste of its forbidden fruit.</i>

3
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:43,468
<i>In the 1930s and '40s,
it was the Mafia and gambling.</i>

4
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:48,265
<i>In the late '50s, America's first topless
showgirls appeared at the Dunes Casino.</i>

5
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,973
<i>And in the '60s, it was an about
Frank and the Rat Pack.</i>

6
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:59,602
<i>But today, damn!
Vegas has become Disneyland for adults.</i>

7
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,780
<i>And let me tell you something.
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.</i>

8
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,324
<i>See, in this town,
you don't know if it's day or night.</i>

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,404
<i>And guess what? You don't care,
because you're in Vegas, baby!</i>

10
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,956
<i>From the casinos to the clubs,
the pools and the strip bars,</i>

11
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:16,289
<i>it's the best place in the world for
men and women to get their freak on.</i>

12
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,458
Okay, just be careful
because it's a wedding dress.

13
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,834
Why are you stressing? It's beautiful.

14
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,881
<i>Unless, of course,
they go together as couples.</i>

15
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,129
Zeke?

16
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,428
Zeke the Freak! It's me, Marty. Remember?

17
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,637
Marty the One Man Party!
What up? What up, man?

18
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:34,728
Oh, man, wait till I tell Luis
the Freak is back in town!

19
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,057
Two of my wildest nights ever
was with Z to the F.

20
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,645
I can only imagine.

21
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,485
Oh, baby, you don't even got to imagine.
We got this on video.

22
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,562
She don't wanna see that.

23
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,988
- She ain't about that life?
- No.

24
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,067
That's sweet. This man is a god.
A legend with the ladies.

25
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,948
We used to get him drunk
just to get his leftovers.

26
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,067
I was young, I used to come by here
once in a while.

27
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,392
Sounds like you came here a lot.

28
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,621
You remember
Marco's big blow-out bash last year?

29
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,747
That was a few years ago.

30
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,670
- Them strippers was off the chain.
- Marty, this is my woman, Mya.

31
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,918
Nice to meet you.

32
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,920
No! Wait!

33
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,673
You took him down?

34
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,016
Lower the flag, baby! Retire the rubbers.

35
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,593
Zeke the Freak is getting married!

36
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,428
No! No, dude, God, no.

37
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,991
We just here for a friend's wedding.
Mya just made the dresses.

38
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,391
- Designed.
- Designed the dresses.

39
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,397
Well, I'm just saying,
if you can get away later on,

40
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,446
Luis is having an after-party
at the Chicken Ranch...

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,567
I'm right here!

42
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,741
- Well, this how we do, baby!
- Let me just get with you later.

43
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,536
All right. Get your girl in check, she gonna
make me look bad out here in the street, man.

44
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,455
Wait till I tell Luis the Freak is back in town!

45
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,831
I don't know that dude, really.
I met him one time. He drives and cuts hair.

46
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,994
- Hell, no.
- Zeke the Freak is back in town, baby!

47
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,335
<i>Now, my opinion?</i>

48
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,793
<i>The only thing worse than going to Vegas
as a couple is going as man and wife.</i>

49
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,298
Babe, you see the car?

50
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,005
Look at these hookers.

51
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,488
Tish, honey, those are not hookers.

52
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,188
They're just girls having fun in Vegas.
It's really not a big deal.

53
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:58,141
They probably got no dad in their life,
low self-esteem. It's very sad, actually.

54
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,723
By the way, Bennett, that fanny-pack
really screams "Vegas Weekend."

55
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,935
Yeah, Tish got it for me. It's safer to
keep your money in the front in Vegas.

56
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,440
- Plus, she gave me a bonus.
- Bet she did.

57
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,740
And I can get to the money if I need to.
It's right in the front.

58
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:10,987
I can't wait to get to the room.

59
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,363
All right.

60
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,496
Okay, good, there's gonna be like an hour
between check-in and separation.

61
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,120
- For what?
- We're trying to have a baby, ASAP.

62
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,497
I waited nine years to get married,
so we're, you know.

63
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:25,331
Congratulations! I'm so happy for you!

64
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,291
- I hope for your sake it's a boy.
- Why?

65
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,878
Well, you know, when you have a boy,
you just worry about his wiener.

66
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:35,220
When you have a girl, you have to worry
about all the wieners coming at her.

67
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,851
Smacking her around.
You remember how it is.

68
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,226
The romance and magic of scheduled sex.

69
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,523
- Girl's not gonna wait forever.
- Yeah, no, I get it.

70
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,078
She doesn't want to be the "old" mom.

71
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,611
I can't believe it, man! You as a father.

72
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,651
I know, right? I can't believe it either.

73
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,942
She's like a drill sergeant, on a schedule!

74
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,348
It's like there's a shot clock,

75
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,495
constantly winding down to one,
and I gotta hit the last shot.

76
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,284
Last week, I thought I sprained it.

77
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,916
You know, the worst part about it is
I had to stop smoking pot.

78
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,993
- No! You? Pot.
- Yeah. Me.

79
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,794
- It's like saying goodbye to an old friend.
- Why?

80
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,464
Because I can only deal with
one stoned child at a time, that's why.

81
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,758
- She heard us.
- She hears everything.

82
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:19,431
<i>Fortunately, some couples know exactly
how to embrace the true spirit of Vegas.</i>

83
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,056
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

84
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,481
<i>So they hadn't seen each other for 10 days
because of Lauren's business trip.</i>

85
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,637
<i>Now you know what they say.</i>

86
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,065
<i>Absence does make the heart
and other organs grow fonder.</i>

87
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,397
<i>Despite its reputation as Sin City,</i>

88
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,029
<i>Vegas is still the number one
destination in the country</i>

89
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,828
<i>for couples to do the craziest thing of all,
get married. Dummies.</i>

90
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,988
It is the perfect setting.

91
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,950
Everything is perfect.
You know, this kind of looks like...

92
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,205
Ancient Rome, like Spartacus.

93
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,628
Excuse me, when have you seen Spartacus?

94
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,081
At Grandma's, when she falls asleep
during Grey's Anatomy.

95
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,212
I do not fall asleep when I'm babysitting you!

96
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,261
So, Candace, the bride will enter from here,

97
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,430
and right there is where...

98
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,054
We get married.

99
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,937
So, remember, you must be here on time
so we can begin your ceremony promptly.

100
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,059
- We cannot hold up the next wedding party.
- Yes.

101
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,774
Perfect timing!
Your wedding programs just arrived.

102
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:08,850
I've got that.

103
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:12,313
It was so sweet of your mom
to splurge on French linen paper.

104
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,445
Candace, you are the only daughter
she's ever gonna have.

105
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,243
And I think this whole process
has really been healing for her.

106
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,245
Especially after the passing
of Deacon Johnson.

107
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,073
Aunt Winnie said he died in bed
with Miss Loretta.

108
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,375
But at least he had a happy ending.

109
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,451
There you go.

110
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,128
Thank you.

111
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,918
- What?
- What?

112
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,295
"Michael and Tandis"?

113
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,797
Seriously?

114
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:35,968
No, no, no!

115
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,591
Oh, baby. They probably misheard her.

116
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,971
Do not have a mama's boy relapse
on our wedding weekend.

117
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,098
No. Baby, I'm gonna give you
the perfect wedding. All right?

118
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,429
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

119
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:55,273
<i>I arrived the only way a sane person
should for a weekend in Vegas.</i>

120
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,948
<i>I'm talking about solo, people!</i>

121
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,318
<i>After Gail pissed on my Pad for no reason,</i>

122
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,871
<i>our marriage counselor suggested that
we have a trial separation for one month.</i>

123
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:06,166
<i>Which meant I was free to do
whatever I wanted, starting right now.</i>

124
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,993
- How you doing"?
- Doing very well, sir, thank you.

125
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,171
Name is Ward. Cedric Ward.
I'm staying in the...

126
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,726
Constantine Villa. Welcome, Mr. Ward.
We've been expecting you.

127
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,259
Your dedicated concierge
is awaiting you inside.

128
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,921
Listen, I'm gonna need you to
dedicate yourself to something.

129
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,306
See this car right here? It's a rental.

130
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,384
And I passed on the insurance "cause
they wanted me to pay the extra five.

131
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,679
I'm not talking about dollars,
I'm talking about hundred.

132
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,229
So I need you to watch this car like

133
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,225
your life depended on it.
Can you do that for me?

134
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,234
Welcome to Caesar's Palace, Mr. Ward.

135
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,610
Well, hello!

136
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,029
- Hello.
- Hi.

137
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,574
This is what I'm talkin' about!

138
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,659
Welcome to Caesar's Palace, Mr. Ward.

139
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:53,088
I'm Vanessa, here to accommodate
your every need during your stay with us.

140
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,404
Well, I got a lotta needs,
so let's get to accommodatin'.

141
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,210
I understand you're part of
the Hanover-Hall wedding party.

142
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,715
You're looking at the best man.

143
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,795
I’m a hook it up.

144
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,884
In my opinion, the Constantine Villa
is the most elegant suite in the entire hotel.

145
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,309
Were they able to put
the stripper pole in the room?

146
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,555
I'm doing a little after-party at
the bachelor party, like an after-after-party?

147
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,390
- Unfortunately not.
- Damn it.

148
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,443
But your personal butler Declan
can take care of your other needs.

149
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,895
My personal butler? I didn't pay for no butler.

150
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,150
It's on the house.

151
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,940
Well, I like this house!

152
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,275
- We aim to please.
- Well, you have succeeded!

153
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,361
Just sign here for
your balance and incidentals.

154
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,913
I'll take you upstairs for
a personal tour of your villa.

155
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,411
Private tour? Okay.
This is pretty standard, right?

156
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,710
- You should read it.
- Nah, it'll say the same stuff.

157
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,082
Been to one hotel, been to them all.

158
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,629
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

159
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,502
I'm waiting on you.

160
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,632
Vanessa!

161
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,255
Cedric! What up, man?

162
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,427
Zeeky! What's up?

163
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,096
- Wait a minute.
- Hey, Mya.

164
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,798
Hold on, hold on. Let me get this right.

165
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,384
Gail let you leave the house
and come to Vegas by yourself?

166
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,434
Don't you start with me, Zeke.

167
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,353
You lyin', I know she here.
Gail, where you at?

168
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,509
Zeke, look at me right now.

169
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,015
- You look amazing.
- It looks good, right?

170
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,725
It's H&M. Men's line.

171
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,529
Hey. I want to introduce you
to my new friend, Vanessa.

172
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,645
Zeke the Freak?

173
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,735
Vanessa...

174
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,861
You son of a bitch!

175
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,909
- What the hell?
- What are you doing?

176
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,283
- Where's my passport?
- I don't have your damn passport!

177
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,362
Why did you do that?

178
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,204
- Zeke, I thought she was gonna drink it.
- Excuse me, excuse me!

179
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,871
Miss Martinez, I am shocked and appalled.
In my office, immediately.

180
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:16,955
Man, chill out.

181
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,208
Watch your back.

182
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,463
Thank you, Zeke.
'Cause I had that in the bag.

183
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,798
That was about to get booked.

184
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,257
She was supposed to give me a tour, sir.

185
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,763
I will give you your personalized,
private tour of the villa.

186
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,517
Well, I don't wanna be rude,
but you can keep that shit.

187
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,063
I want Vanessa, I don't need your tour.

188
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,484
Sir, look at my face. I'm in the Constantine.
The Constantine...

189
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,856
- Constantine.
- Constantine.

190
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,482
I can't talk to you right now.

191
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,906
Are you okay?
Your baggage is gonna catch up to you, man.

192
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,073
Mya, are you all right?

193
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,903
You gotta be strong. I get it.
Did she go this way? Vanessa!

194
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:48,987
Cedric!

195
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,665
- See you later.
- All right.

196
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,122
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you, nice to meet you.

197
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,001
<i>The whole crew was back together.</i>

198
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,336
<i>Without even realizing it,</i>

199
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,014
<i>the men and the women had
divided themselves into opposing teams.</i>

200
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,514
Look! We both got on green shirts
and we both got blue eyes!

201
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,095
<i>It was a sign of things to come.</i>

202
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,521
- Let's go get a drink, man.
- Please.

203
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,348
You can really clear a room out, Bennett.

204
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,184
- Tell me, what are we doing tonight?
- No, no, no!

205
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,689
I want to go see Jersey <i>Boys.</i>

206
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,022
We're not going to see
no damn Jersey Boys, Bennett.

207
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,447
- Why not?
- What do you mean, "Why not?"

208
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,866
Because we're men.
We're at a bachelor party in Vegas.

209
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,035
We're here to make bad decisions
and regret them the next day.

210
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,487
Story of your life, right, Zeke?

211
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,038
I say we take a vote.

212
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,365
Bennett, we're not taking no vote.

213
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,166
Okay, you know what?
I wanna talk to everybody.

214
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,035
Before we all start power-trippin', okay?

215
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,838
Understand that Michael had the opportunity

216
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,713
to choose anybody standing here
to be his best man.

217
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,382
I want you all to remember that he chose me.

218
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,130
You know why?
'Cause I'm the best man with a plan.

219
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,883
I didn't want to drop that ball on y'all,
but y'all didn't leave me a choice.

220
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,133
Now I'm the bad guy.

221
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:52,138
So, I've been giving this a lot of thought.
I want you to be my best man.

222
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,387
- Me?
- No, Ced, actually, I was talking to Do...

223
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,768
No, listen, don't say nothin' right now, man.

224
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,726
Like, I knew you and I had a connection,
but this is crazy!

225
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,688
Let me tell you something, this means
so much to me. I'm not gonna let you down.

226
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,070
Let me tell you something, I'm gonna be the
best best man in the history of all best men.

227
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,901
I've always wanted to be a best man,
and you want to give me that opportunity?

228
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,703
We came here to golf,
and now you gonna give me this blessing?

229
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,160
I gotta go to the bathroom, Dom!

230
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,670
<i>This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine</i>

231
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,504
You made the right choice.

232
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,922
All right, couples, listen up!

233
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,600
Come on, put a little pep in your step.

234
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,881
Listen up, people. You got exactly one hour

235
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,338
to go settle into your room
and say your goodbyes!

236
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,677
'Cause for the next 24 hours,
the boys are gonna be with the boys...

237
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,429
And the girls with the girls.

238
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,976
Tomorrow, you can all go back to

239
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,679
that miserable and sexless existence
that is marriage.

240
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,564
- No offense, Mike.
- You don't gotta worry about us.

241
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,645
We gonna be happy and sexy.

242
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,936
Well, you better treasure that. Okay.

243
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,191
What? Gail? No! Not now.

244
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,401
Let me tell you something, Mike.

245
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,324
Truth is, Gail and I were both happy
and sexy for 22 years.

246
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,617
See? There you go.

247
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,036
Then we met each other.

248
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,966
That ship sailed. Like the Titanic...

249
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,388
Come on, baby, we only got an hour.

250
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,074
Before you all go, listen to me.

251
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,159
- Real quick, guys.
- So weird.

252
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,210
Let's discuss meeting points.

253
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,459
<i>The teams were chosen,
the players were ready,</i>

254
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,381
<i>and it was time for the pre-game warm-up.</i>

255
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,697
Everybody else to their room.
I don't know where mine is.

256
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,214
<i>In basketball, you have to know
what kinda offense you runnin'.</i>

257
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,759
<i>But no matter what it is,
the goal is to outscore your opponent.</i>

258
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:19,605
<i>The Constantine Villa,
all 12,000 square feet of it.</i>

259
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,809
<i>The ultimate bachelor party pad.
Yeah. I had definitely scored first.</i>

260
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,394
- Your key, sir.
- Right, right.

261
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,149
If there's anything else you need,

262
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,650
your personal butler Declan
is here to serve you.

263
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,822
<i>Okay-</i>

264
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,492
- Well, thank you, Marcel Heffer.
- Haffer.

265
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,327
Haffer.

266
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,664
"Marcel" will work just fine, thank you.

267
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,289
I'll call you Marc. Thank you.

268
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,328
Declan!

269
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,790
Morning, sir.
I trust everything is up to your standards, sir.

270
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,504
Now, I understand that you made an inquiry

271
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:53,259
about making some structural changes
to your suite, Mr. Ward.

272
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,263
You got the poles! Yes!

273
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:03,440
A certain member of a certain royal family
left more behind than just memories.

274
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,774
Yes, you can almost smell
the aristocratic DNA from here.

275
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,320
I don't know what that means.

276
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,065
It doesn't matter.

277
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,400
Now, I shall be next door.

278
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,487
So if you need anything,
just press number one on your keypad.

279
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,071
Right.

280
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,202
Hey, hey, hey.
Let me tip you, man.

281
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,453
- No, sir, I couldn't...
- Please, stop.

282
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,126
- People don't think black people tip.
- I do this for the love of the job...

283
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,795
Well, thank you very much, sir,
that would be lovely.

284
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,419
I wasn't gonna give it all to you.
I'll give you a certain amount, sir...

285
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,717
- Thank you, sir.
- No, thank you!

286
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,137
No, the 10%... Okay, you're welcome.

287
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,468
You gone?

288
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,429
Oh, shit!

289
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,398
What's that?

290
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,479
That's a big-ass table!

291
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,245
<i>The race was on.</i>

292
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,790
<i>No matter what Lauren had planned
for the bachelorette party,</i>

293
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,583
<i>it didn't matter,
'cause she was already behind.</i>

294
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,037
Declan, can you get that smell out of here?

295
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,295
Babe, we got a really great view of the Strip.

296
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,674
Come on, we don't have much time.

297
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,171
- Let's go.
- All right.

298
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,670
Hang on, let me get these...

299
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,255
I want three good shots
before we go out tonight.

300
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,885
- Three?
- Yeah. Yeah.

301
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,013
My belt is stuck. Help me.
Your hands are cold.

302
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,012
Yeah, no, no.

303
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,142
That's never happened before.

304
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,940
Yeah, I just need a minute. Gotta reload.

305
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,685
- Is it me'?
- No, no. I just need a second.

306
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:31,899
- You know what we need?
- What'?

307
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:32,978
Role Play-

308
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,193
- Role play?
- Yeah.

309
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,398
<i>Okay-</i>

310
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,279
- What, you brought stuff?
- Yeah, I came prepared, babe.

311
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,530
What's this?

312
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:39,952
<i>This</i> is <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

313
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,075
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

314
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,665
I am Daenerys,

315
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,994
the virgin princess of dragon blood.

316
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:52,378
And you, you are Khal Drogo,
my fierce nomadic king.

317
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,968
Take me, you barbarian! Take me!

318
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,421
Babe, babe, babe.
I just need a second, okay?

319
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,515
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

320
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,967
I need to get stoned.

321
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,602
Don't tell me
you brought pot through the airport.

322
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,681
Not pot. Pot strips.

323
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,233
Breath strips as far as
airport security is concerned.

324
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,981
Kills germs that cause bad breath

325
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,437
and is the equivalent of
three great bong hits.

326
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,487
- It's a great product.
- Jeremy, we talked about this.

327
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,407
We're in Vegas, Kris, for a party weekend.

328
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,406
You remember what it's like
to chill out and have fun, right?

329
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,486
You don't think I'm fun?

330
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,992
<i>You're like Louis Gossett, Jr.</i>
in <i>An Officer And A Gentleman.</i>

331
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,621
- I'm sorry, I didn't wanna say it.
- Please. This is fun.

332
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,747
- It's wild!
- Come on.

333
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,329
For your information, me and the girls
are gonna get our freak on tonight.

334
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,962
With Lauren in charge.
What, is she gonna enroll you in a 401 K?

335
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,208
You know what?

336
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,299
Daenerys, you actually
need that more than I do.

337
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,049
<i>Now, by being the groom,
Michael figured that</i>

338
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,851
<i>it couldn't be any easier
than an uncontested lay-up.</i>

339
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,055
- Do you hear that?
- What?

340
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,764
Silence.

341
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,099
I think we're finally alone.

342
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,060
Imagine that.

343
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,647
Michael, careful.

344
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,657
I can't believe how much of a klutz I am.

345
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,252
Come here. Let me help you take this off.
I have to. You're wet.

346
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:06,782
We have not had sex in 90 days.
So tomorrow night can be special.

347
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,959
No, I am not caving now.

348
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,205
Maybe I am caving a little.

349
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,506
Ma!

350
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,878
Oh, my goodness, Loretta!

351
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,586
Sorry, sorry. Didn't know you were here.

352
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,841
Of course she's here.

353
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,299
Your Uncle Tony sends his regrets.

354
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,225
- Where did she come from?
- I have no idea.

355
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,100
But while I have you, I'd like for you
to sign off on the centerpieces.

356
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,522
Yes.

357
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,099
Well, they're stunning,

358
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:38,063
but those are peach roses
and I wanted white.

359
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,989
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, I know.

360
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,738
But Fernando thought, you know,

361
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:47,493
this being your second wedding and all,
perhaps white was not appropriate.

362
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:51,793
We could always go darker.
Lavender, brick. Brick is good.

363
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:56,169
Mom. We discussed this, okay?
This is not Fernando's wedding.

364
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,421
This is Candace's wedding
and she would like white roses.

365
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,300
All right, all right. To hell with
what's appropriate and respectable.

366
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,722
I'll call Fernando right now
and just forget I was ever here.

367
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,352
I'm sorry.

368
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,520
Are you in the adjoining suite?

369
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,852
Yes. What a coincidence.

370
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,357
It is.

371
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,564
Come on now. Don't worry.

372
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,991
Once the door closes
you can barely hear a thing.

373
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,067
Ta!

374
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,617
Did you know that
she was in the adjoining suite?

375
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,118
Of course not. No.

376
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,371
Don't you think that's a little Norman Bates

377
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,124
to have your mother
sleeping in the next room?

378
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,046
- On our wedding night?
- Yes, yes. Yes, I do.

379
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,418
The doors are soundproof,

380
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,798
and I'm sure she's gonna respect
our wishes and our privacy, so...

381
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:42,877
<i>Okay-</i>

382
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,886
Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry.

383
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,424
Forgot my cell phone.

384
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,971
Proceed.

385
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,234
Norman Bates, my ass.

386
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,443
<i>Damn! That was like being blocked
from behind by LeBron.</i>

387
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:02,609
<i>It's called pre-game jitters, people.
Happens to the best of us.</i>

388
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,984
<i>It's called pre-game jitters, people.
Happens to the best of us.</i>

389
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,820
<i>Michael's been bitched,
and Jeremy's shot was flat.</i>

390
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,746
<i>Now it was time to see how Zeke was doing.</i>

391
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,243
Is it steamy in here, or is it just you?

392
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,324
It's just me.

393
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,543
<i>Okay-</i>

394
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,794
What do you think?

395
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,341
- Zeke!
- It's nice.

396
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,463
It's nice?

397
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:27,389
No, that is beautiful.
I didn't expect it to look that expensive.

398
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,223
You didn't expect it to look this expensive?

399
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,978
No, you're a fashion genius.
What do you want me to say? I love it.

400
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,680
- Babe, can't the hotel do that for you?
- No.

401
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,891
Look at this Grecian tub.
Let me fix you a bath.

402
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,817
We got enough time for two quickies.

403
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,566
Stop. Stop. Not in the mood.
Not in the mood. Okay?

404
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,740
Besides, I'd like to be the one woman
you haven't slept with in Vegas.

405
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:46,987
Really? Wait. Hold up.

406
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,488
Mya.

407
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,616
I slept with one woman.

408
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,041
You know, counting is so damn high school.

409
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,157
We all have a past.
It's not like I lied about mine.

410
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,763
Yeah, but you definitely downplayed it.

411
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,381
Who doesn't downplay?
You downplayed your fling with Kanye.

412
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,379
That's not the point.

413
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,304
All I'm saying is that I don't think it's fair
that my past is an issue and yours is not.

414
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,640
What I'm saying is that I feel...

415
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,099
I don't feel like you're being...
I don't feel like your letting me in.

416
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,934
How am I not letting you in'?
I'm trying to let you in right now!

417
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,232
I'm saying you're giving me half-truths,
not telling me everything.

418
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,908
- Ask me what you wanna know.
- Anything?

419
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,227
I'll tell you whatever you wanna know.

420
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,656
I wanna know what you guys are doing
for the bachelor party tonight.

421
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,361
You know, it's nothing extravagant
because it's not in the budget.

422
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,991
It's just a night out with the guys.

423
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,954
Get a steak dinner, maybe some gambling.

424
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,661
And hit a couple clubs.

425
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,460
See? I just told you
and you don't believe me.

426
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,540
You'?

427
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,502
Or "Zeke the Freak"?

428
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,466
<i>Damn! Rejected.</i>

429
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,008
Hey!

430
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,135
That was masculine.

431
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,431
Relax. You haven't got anything
I haven't seen already

432
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,354
in a much, much larger size.

433
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,141
You know, the air comes in low, right...

434
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,441
Hey, Miss Loretta.

435
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,691
Welcome to the Constantine Villa.

436
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,272
Are you ready for the tour?

437
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,323
- Are you ready to be slapped?
- No, ma'am.

438
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,817
I don't want that.

439
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,197
Now listen very carefully.

440
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,323
I've got a list of the dos and don'ts
for Michael's bachelor party tonight.

441
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,625
I don't think we need a list...

442
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,544
My Michael is a good Christian boy.

443
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,590
He's always been a good Christian boy.

444
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,169
Some stuff... He has.

445
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,131
And I want him to still be
a good Christian boy

446
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,965
when he gets married tomorrow.

447
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,300
- Are we clear?
- Yes.

448
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,010
Are we clear, short man?

449
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:22,097
No, we... I'm seeing through what you said.
That's how clear it is.

450
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:24,849
Thank you.

451
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,357
And put some clothes on.
There's nothing attractive about that.

452
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,608
Yes, ma'am.

453
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,531
Miss Loretta, you didn't have a key, did you?
You just...

454
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,942
She got ass.

455
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,370
<i>Well, with the warm-ups looking pretty bleak,</i>

456
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,493
<i>we had to turn to
the one member of our team that</i>

457
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,994
<i>we could always count on to score.</i>

458
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,746
So, how are you?

459
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,704
Good. Great, actually.

460
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,086
Subscriptions are up 11%
since the Michelle Obama issue,

461
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,795
- and I just closed this amazing deal...
- Baby, baby.

462
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,962
- Yeah?
- How are you?

463
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,431
Better now.

464
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,228
- Wait. I totally forgot to ask.
- What?

465
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,900
How was it catering the TED talk?

466
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,352
They asked me back for next year.

467
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,903
- Really?
- And the best part.

468
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,572
Chef Cotillard told me I had a gift.

469
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,239
In fact, he's making me and the guys
a special tasting menu just for us.

470
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,161
I am so proud of you.

471
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,237
Thank you.

472
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,615
Don't get it.

473
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,859
- No, I'm just gonna see who it is.
- No, don't get it.

474
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,038
Oh, my God. I have to get it.
It's Lee Fox. CEO! Lauren.

475
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,749
<i>Lauren, it's Lee.</i>

476
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,050
Listen, a position's opened up
at the parent company.

477
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,297
<i>I think you'd be perfect for it.</i>

478
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,502
Grabbing a shower.

479
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,629
For what?

480
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:42,268
COO of our Global Media Group.
Are you interested?

481
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,220
Are you kidding me? Absolutely.

482
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,431
Great, I got a meeting with
the board of directors this afternoon.

483
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:50,394
Things could move fast. I need you settled
in New York by the first of the month.

484
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,145
Wait, New York?

485
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,532
That is where
our headquarters are located, Lauren.

486
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,193
I got a good feeling about this. Now go.

487
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,195
I did, too.

488
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,791
You look beautiful in that light.

489
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,001
How'd it go?

490
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,922
It went good. Great, actually.

491
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,054
- Dominic, we need to talk...
- Housekeeping!

492
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,635
The guys are here.

493
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,810
- Yeah.
- Hello.

494
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,887
And you know what? You should get that.

495
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,190
- No, they can wait.
- No, they'll get us put out.

496
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,892
- They're so loud.
- That's true.

497
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,393
- All right, I'll take care of it.
- Okay.

498
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,979
Come on, Homeo and Do-me-yet!

499
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,906
- Open up the door, Dom.
- Yo, yo, yo, yo.

500
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,542
- Button up. I'm insecure enough as it is.
- It's a little early.

501
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,411
- Let's go.
- Give me a sec. Give me a sec.

502
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,081
What up, Lauren? You look good, girl.
What kind of lotion you wearing?

503
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,248
You been on the treadmill?

504
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,326
So, I gotta go.

505
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,662
<i>Okay-</i>

506
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,917
- ls everything all right?
- Hurry up, man.

507
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,252
Yeah.

508
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,833
Hasn't this part burned out yet?

509
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,169
You guys still all like each other and stuff?

510
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,471
God, I just love you so much.

511
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,923
Damn! Come on, boy.

512
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,758
I love you too, babe.

513
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,017
- Get a room!
- We're in it!

514
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,766
Well, stop.

515
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,563
- Behave.
- I'll be good.

516
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,639
Okay, please.

517
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,476
Hey, Lauren. Your afterglow is amazing.

518
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,019
Move.

519
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,274
He was killing that.

520
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,397
Shit.

521
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,617
<i>So, even though we were
a tittle confused on how to score,</i>

522
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,194
<i>it was time for the first quarter tip-off.</i>

523
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,405
Your guests are here, sir.

524
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,702
There they go!

525
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,203
Welcome to my crib, gentlemen.

526
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:32,583
Damn, C, I knew you had a good year,
but how big was your bonus, man?

527
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,379
Dom, you only get to be best man once.

528
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:37,425
Besides, I got a great deal. Real good deal.
I'm paying four grand a night.

529
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,796
- What?
- For all this?

530
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,674
- It's gotta be at least 10.
- No, it's not.

531
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,221
You sure you don't need us
to chip in for this?

532
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,344
Silence! Don't insult me like that.

533
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,514
Guys, he says he's good. Let him treat us.

534
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:51,188
Listen, me being here with my best friends,
that makes it worth every penny.

535
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,515
Every damn penny.

536
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,646
Ced, put some clothes on, man.

537
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,477
You guys want some drinks?

538
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,982
<i>- I'll</i> have a drink.
- That's the only reason I'm here.

539
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:01,066
Okay. Declan, let's do that.

540
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,858
I'm sorry, sir.

541
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,365
I thought you were trying
to turn the lights on.

542
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,444
No.

543
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,865
All right, gentlemen,
let's get these glasses up in the air.

544
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,746
To a night that we will never forget.

545
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,667
You guys realize
this is the first time in three months

546
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,915
we've been together for even a drink?

547
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,086
Sad, what happened to us?

548
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,483
- Work, man.
- Nah, relationships.

549
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,669
- Weddings.
- Kids.

550
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,125
Fellas, that's why
we need to embrace this moment,

551
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,757
because for one blissful night, gentlemen,

552
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,963
we are free from all of our obligations.

553
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,047
Preach on.

554
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,371
From all of our responsibilities,
and we're definitely...

555
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,057
We're free from our women. How about that?

556
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,763
- Look, mine's down.
- This is Zeke.

557
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,894
<i>Zeke, let me talk to Cedric. It's important.</i>

558
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,853
You picked the right best man.
He knows it. You know it, too.

559
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:39,944
- It's Gail.
- What?

560
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,272
- She says it's important.
- Tell her I'm busy.

561
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,107
- She knows I'm with you.
- So, why you pick up the phone?

562
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,612
- Because it was a private number.
- Lower your voice.

563
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,114
- Lower your voice.
- It was a private number.

564
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,991
You don't answer private numbers.
Give me the phone, man.

565
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,914
- We expecting strippers to call.
- Just give me the phone.

566
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,492
<i>- Listen, you drunk Muppet.
- Gail.</i>

567
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,747
<i>I tried to use my credit card. It was declined.</i>

568
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,704
- Declined? What are you talking about?
- You <i>heard</i> me.

569
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,960
<i>If I was there, I'd kick you in your throat.</i>

570
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,586
I may have went over the limit a little bit.

571
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,667
<i>How much, Cedric?</i>

572
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,594
Gail, listen to me.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime type thing.

573
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,110
<i>- I'm gonna kill you!
- Okay, this...</i>

574
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,514
Hello?

575
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,932
Hello?

576
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,592
Gail?

577
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:12,803
Declined?

578
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:16,060
Here you go, sir.
This should make you feel a little better.

579
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,438
Thank you, Declan.
I'm serious, I needed that right now.

580
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,817
This is so refreshing to finally live
with someone who understands me.

581
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,945
Likewise, sir. I think we're like soul brothers
from different mothers.

582
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,403
I don't think that's it, but...

583
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,999
<i>- I'll</i> have some more.
- So what's the plan, Ced?

584
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,702
See those flyers right there?
I made those up for the after-party.

585
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,834
Now look, each guy here is
responsible for five girls a piece.

586
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,416
That's how I did the math. Five, 10, 15, 20, 25.

587
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,297
- Guys, guys...
- I make 30, okay?

588
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,253
Guys! I don't need this.

589
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,589
Tomorrow is the biggest day of my life.

590
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,345
- Here we go.
- Get to marry my queen.

591
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:53,268
I need you guys on point and on time.

592
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,438
No, you're right. Did you remember to
wax your vagina for the weekend?

593
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,735
Think like a man! Just for five minutes.

594
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,062
- I am acting like a man.
- You're not acting like a man.

595
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,898
You got the rest of your life to follow
this woman around a grocery store.

596
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,324
- Stop!
- Tomorrow's a big day.

597
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,320
- This is your bachelor party, Michael.
- And this is wisdom.

598
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,622
I'm your best man. Let me do my job.
I done printed these flyers and shit.

599
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,244
Why don't we see a show or something?

600
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,951
Don't worry, there will be a show.

601
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:20,129
Wait. Criss Angel's still in town.
We could start off there.

602
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,081
Jersey Boy won eight Tonys.

603
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,750
<i>We had decided to run the motion offense.</i>

604
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,928
<i>Which means keep moving
and keep your problems to yourself.</i>

605
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:32,926
<i>The maid of honor was about to
put her game plan into effect.</i>

606
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,009
<i>Or so she thought.</i>

607
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,518
Hello, sweetie.

608
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,473
I heard you were having a little get-together
for the bridesmaids

609
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,057
and thought I'd bring a few refreshments.

610
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,357
Thank you.

611
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,605
You're welcome.

612
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,354
You won't be needing this.

613
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:48,820
Another one.

614
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,778
Put the tea over to the left.
Girls are gonna love this.

615
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,243
- Ladies.
- Hey!

616
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,950
Sonia! You came already.

617
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,748
- My God, your outfit is so cute.
- Thank you!

618
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,922
But it is not complete without

619
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,624
- this.
- There you go.

620
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,634
Thank you, guys-

621
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:08,885
You know what, though?

622
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,341
I think there's still something missing.

623
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,460
- Does feel like something's missing.
- There's definitely something missing.

624
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,604
Candace, meet ldris.

625
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,181
Give me your arm.

626
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,016
- Awful.
- Come here.

627
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,603
So you can get used to being chained to
one man for the rest of your life.

628
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,028
- My very own ldris.
- Let's hit the pool.

629
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:42,702
Mr. Ward?

630
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,961
Yes!

631
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:48,634
Hey, guys. I'm sorry, she just called me.
Let me get through y'all.

632
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,632
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Just let me get through.

633
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,805
Excuse me! Sorry! Hercules.

634
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,134
Hi. Welcome to Venus pool. I'm Leikula.

635
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,308
I'm Cedric. How are you?

636
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,011
I just spoke with Declan
and we have your cabana prepared.

637
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,346
I'm following you.

638
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,772
- Perfect.
- Patience.

639
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,557
Oh, yeah.

640
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:09,731
<i>Every player knows during the day,
the real action's at the poof.</i>

641
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,408
<i>It's the place to hook up and strut your stuff
and check out everyone else 's.</i>

642
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,327
<i>And the best part? Chlorine kills everything.</i>

643
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,655
Is this a topless pool?

644
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,241
Nah, Mike. They just got T-shirts
with their breasts on them.

645
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,605
Why do you think the line was so long, baby?
Come on, man.

646
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,165
I hope this meets your expectations.

647
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,589
Oh, no. Sweetie, this has exceeded
our expectations. Thank you.

648
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,213
- You're welcome. Enjoy.
- I appreciate it. Okay.

649
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,670
- What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
- All right.

650
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:35,176
I suggest you all look at some of
this scattered ass around here.

651
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,677
<i>We thought we hit the jackpot.</i>

652
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,351
<i>But the danger of Vegas
is the mirage it creates.</i>

653
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,770
<i>The men were putting on a cool front.
But let me tell you something.</i>

654
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,268
<i>From underneath,
trouble was brewing like a pressure cooker.</i>

655
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,656
Do you see what I am walking around with?

656
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,857
I see it.

657
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,067
<i>Unfortunately for the girls,</i>

658
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,245
<i>their set offense had run into
a nasty zone defense.</i>

659
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,076
Shit!

660
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,994
- Un-cuff me!
- I don't have the key.

661
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,077
Un-cuff me!

662
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,291
I got it. Watch out.

663
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,458
Ladies.

664
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,509
- Hi!
- Hi!

665
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,345
- Just go. Hide the cuffs.
- Come right on in.

666
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,632
High tea.

667
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,551
Damn! Look at that.

668
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:21,931
Dude, can you imagine
having a woman like that?

669
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,059
Just keep this in mind. For every supermodel
you see, every hot girl you see,

670
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,390
there's some dude that's sick of her shit.

671
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,188
Zeke, you and Mya
having problems again, man?

672
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,861
- Obviously.
- She's suddenly fixated with my past.

673
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,564
That whole "Zeke the Freak" thing.

674
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,911
Oh, God!

675
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:40,988
Imagine that.

676
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:44,291
Take a second to look at this damn view.
This is what it's about, man!

677
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,492
Fellas!

678
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:49,705
Bennett!

679
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,507
- Get your ass up! What's wrong with you?
- Clay Aiken! Asleep.

680
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,583
What are you all doing"?

681
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,965
- MotorStorm: Apocalypse, baby!
- And somehow, he's whooping my ass!

682
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,881
I'm about to whoop both your asses.
Do you know where you are right now?

683
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,136
At the pool.

684
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,967
- We're in Vegas!
- Why are you screaming?

685
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,594
- Mr. Ward?
- Yes.

686
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,351
- Care for another drink?
- You know what?

687
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,649
Yes. You know what?
Give me something strong.

688
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,228
And give me five more shots of testosterone

689
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,951
for these ladies that I'm with right now.

690
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,071
- Thank you.
- Yes.

691
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,821
Boy, I'd like to climb that mountain
right there, I'll tell you that much.

692
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,196
That is a big badonkadonk.

693
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,278
All of a sudden, you're good at video games?

694
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,284
Listen, I play this every night with Duke.

695
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,956
Duke's a great kid. He cracks me up.

696
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,454
You know what he asked me earlier today?

697
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,412
If, after the wedding,
if it would be okay if he called me "Dad".

698
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,166
Time out.

699
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:34,125
Let me ask you a question.
That doesn't freak you out at all?

700
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,299
What?

701
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,295
Out of nowhere, all of a sudden...
You're an instant clad, just like that.

702
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,634
You're responsible for
this whole other human.

703
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,056
- No.
- Not a cat, not a dog.

704
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:44,726
This is a human,
with teeth and hair and bones and blood.

705
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,962
What if they hurt somebody?
What if they get kidnapped?

706
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,270
Or if they kidnap somebody? Either way,
it's all down to you for the rest of your life.

707
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,475
That doesn't freak you out?

708
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,356
No. I'm excited about it.

709
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,149
I don't even know why I ask you stuff.

710
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,855
I want you to stand up and enjoy this...

711
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,155
What?

712
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,608
Man, you gotta take one of these.

713
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,284
What's that?

714
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,452
We're looking for people for amateur night.

715
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,155
You're looking at the wrong people, man.
You need to be looking in the pool.

716
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,615
You got your pick of the litter out there.

717
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,018
They look good,
but we need some men, and you fit the bill.

718
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,828
- No, no, no.
- Yeah.

719
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,960
'Cause I got my shirt off, you probably
judging by my amazing physique that

720
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,507
that's my cup of tea, it's not.

721
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,210
There's huge cash prizes.
You come down, you win some money...

722
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,796
<i>- I'll</i> take one.
- Bennett, sit your ass down.

723
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,879
Free hot buffet.

724
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,970
So, some hot chick just rolls up on you.

725
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:28,429
She's like, "Do you mind helping me
with a little bit of suntan lotion?"

726
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,015
- What do you do?
- It'd never happen, but I'd stand my ground.

727
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,691
Hello, Blue Eyes.

728
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,611
I was hoping you could help me.
There's a couple of spots I can't reach.

729
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,703
I probably, probably shouldn't.

730
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,280
You probably should.

731
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,575
What, you're in a relationship or something?

732
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,957
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

733
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,128
So am I.

734
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:58,300
- Really?
- This is Vegas, baby. Lighten up.

735
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,636
You heard her, Dom. It's Veg-Ass.

736
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,463
Vegas. Yep.

737
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,972
I love her.

738
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,095
All right.

739
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,222
Sweetie, sit down.

740
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,723
- Let me show you how it is around here.
- Okay, no.

741
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:12,431
'Cause my hands...
I'm sorry, did you just spit at me?

742
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:13,557
'Cause we gonna talk about that.

743
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,940
Excuse me, what is going on? Talk to me.

744
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,236
Spit it out, Dom!

745
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,487
- It didn't...
- What didn't?

746
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,535
- She just wasn't quite...
- She wasn't what?

747
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,328
- She wasn't tall enough.
- Dom, let me tell you something.

748
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:29,748
You know that men spend
their entire life savings to go to Brazil?

749
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,951
You just had Brazil come over here,
and you're gonna turn it away?

750
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,377
You know what, y'all?
I'm sick of this Non-tourage.

751
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,789
'Cause that's what I'm with right now.
I'm gonna get me a new crew.

752
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:37,873
Ced, you being dramatic.

753
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:41,218
I'ma roll with some sailors
and some congressmen.

754
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,170
- Republicans!
- Shut up, Bennett!

755
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,005
You know, I'm done.

756
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,762
Turn up, that's what I'll do.
I'ma have me a good time.

757
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,522
- You gonna join the fun'?
- Girl, you damn right I'ma join the fun!

758
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,896
Yeah!

759
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,316
See what I'm saying?
Y'all wanna sit over here on lounge chairs.

760
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,517
I'm about to get in the water
with some titties.

761
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,296
That's what I tried to give you, Mike.
You didn't want this life, I'm gonna take it!

762
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,406
It's too deep! I can't swim!

763
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:07,828
<i>It's like Finding Nemo.</i>

764
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,576
One of you bitches grab me!

765
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,376
Should we help him?

766
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,453
Nah.

767
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,628
<i>Help!</i>

768
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,708
<i>Turns out, I wasn't the only one
in need of rescuing.</i>

769
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,042
Where was I?

770
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,126
The article.

771
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,554
Yes, yes, yes, the article in the O Magazine.

772
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,306
They talked about
all the craziness that goes on

773
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,383
in these bachelor and bachelorette parties.

774
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:34,097
I read the same article. And the women
are getting just as wild as the men.

775
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:39,693
With the <i>Magic</i> Mike strippers
and the bridesmaids dares.

776
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,979
Or faking an orgasm, you know.

777
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,987
All of that in a crowded bar.

778
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,236
Or doing Jello shots off a stranger's abs?

779
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,030
I don't know why women can't have
just as much fun <i>as</i> men.

780
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,491
She's right. Getting a lap dance
at your bachelor party is expected.

781
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,666
But if women have fun...

782
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,210
You're whores!

783
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,037
- Did she just call us whores?
- Yeah.

784
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,920
Fortunately, I don't have to worry about
all that behavior with you, Candace.

785
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:07,759
All that girlish foolishness.
You're much too old for that!

786
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,381
Much too old.

787
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,225
I heard you the first "old".

788
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,861
So, what are you guys gonna do tonight?

789
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:18,766
Nothing too wild, you know, just girl time,
you know, girls of the same age.

790
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,485
And cocktails at a couple clubs.
Maybe take in a show.

791
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:25,193
Good. Then you'll have plenty of time.

792
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:27,900
Time? Time for what?

793
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,373
- I've gotta get away from her.
- I know, I know.

794
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,540
Anybody got any sleeping pills?

795
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,960
Don't worry. I can get rid of her.

796
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,998
- How?
- I can handle that old battle-ax.

797
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,424
Ladies, I've got another surprise.

798
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,548
We've got reservations tonight...

799
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:52,053
Excuse me. Miss Loretta,
I am so sorry to disappoint you, sweetie,

800
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,100
but we already have plans.

801
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,725
I was able to squeeze in a reservation
for five at Nobu. Corner booth.

802
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,727
- Isn't that a coincidence?
- How so?

803
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,774
Andre the concierge

804
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,605
was able to score reservations
for seven tonight at Nobu.

805
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,531
At the head table. So we're going, girls!

806
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,156
I can't believe you were gonna exclude Tish.

807
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,238
Damn, she's good!

808
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,915
Welcome to the rest of my life.

809
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,788
Okay, you guys,
there's gotta be something that we can do.

810
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,086
What does Miss Loretta want or need?

811
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,583
She needs to get laid.

812
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,289
Wait a minute.

813
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,124
When does your Uncle Eddie arrive?

814
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,630
Didn't you say he flirted with her
at the couple's party?

815
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,340
- No, it will never happen.
- Never say never in Vegas.

816
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,016
Floyd "Money" Mayweather!
I'ma get my dollar sign...

817
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,024
Stop!

818
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,151
Floyd! Can you let him go, man? Please!

819
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,108
- Let him go! Let him go!
- Bennett, get up!

820
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,238
He's way too aggressive!

821
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:55,696
Listen, Floyd, he didn't mean no harm, man.
He just a fan, that's all.

822
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,326
I follow you on Twitter and MySpace.

823
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,749
That's all that is.
Dude, we didn't mean no disrespect.

824
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,543
We here, my friend's getting married.
We having a bachelor party tonight.

825
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,459
We gonna do it at the Caesar's
in the Constantine Villa.

826
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,584
Nice.

827
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,961
I'm just trying to splurge
and show him a good time.

828
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,883
That's what you call $40,000 a night?

829
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,220
He doesn't have a gold card.
That's the problem.

830
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,215
Dude, one of you guys
gotta research that for him.

831
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,472
You know what? You gotta just look that up
yourself, but it's a good investment.

832
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,225
Let me get you this.
This is where we gonna be at tonight.

833
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,932
Just read it, guys! It's a flyer, man!

834
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,438
Here, Floyd? Floyd, can you see me?

835
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,937
Let me slide it.

836
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,897
Floyd, can you get that?

837
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,072
Get the flyer.

838
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,406
Floyd, did you see it?
All right, that's where we at, man.

839
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:36,577
I'm gonna come check this out.

840
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,781
Cool. Well, okay... You know, you all goin'.

841
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,223
'Cause you all got stuff to do.
Goin', man. Thank you again.

842
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,761
- There goes Justin Bieber's best friend!
- Champ, champ, champ!

843
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:47,881
<i>In this battle of the sexes, whichever group
came back with the best stories would win,</i>

844
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,175
<i>and I was determined to
keep us ahead of the girls.</i>

845
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,969
This is where it happens at, fellas. Okay?

846
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,674
We on home base right now, casino floor.
Now look, let's pick our poison.

847
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,762
- What is your problem, Bennett?
- Where you goin'?

848
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,848
Slots! Pharaoh's fortune.

849
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,063
Tish gave me 200 bucks to
gamble with this weekend.

850
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,982
Bennett, you walking around with a purse on,
you talking about playing slots?

851
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,104
What is your problem?

852
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,522
It's a fanny-pack, it's not a purse.

853
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,194
I don't care what it is,
it's attached to your spine!

854
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,773
- What's wrong with slots?
- Everything is wrong with slots!

855
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,530
We're not a group of old women
that just bussed in here from Bakersfield!

856
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,451
Now listen to me. We came here as a group

857
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,527
and we gonna play as a group.
Let's play Blackjack.

858
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,287
I only played blackjack once
and I lost 300 bucks.

859
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,367
- So what?
- I lost 600.

860
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,330
Spring Break, my junior year, it was my entire
money for weed the whole semester.

861
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,710
- I almost dropped out of school.
- Okay, now. Hey! Hey!

862
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,791
Y'all got negativity floating all in the air!

863
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,757
I'ma take it, and I'ma put it in my pocket,
and guess what?

864
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,512
You're not getting that back. Okay?

865
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:40,050
Now we will keep the fun train going.
Let's keep tchoo-tchooing, guys!

866
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,386
You rolling with the pros.
Just follow our lead.

867
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,688
- Thank you, Dom! Thank you.
- No!

868
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:48,813
Guys, there comes a time in a man's life
when he has to take a stand.

869
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,736
- Can I go play slots?
- Take your ass to that slot machine.

870
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,109
- Don't bring that negative energy here!
- ls there a bathroom that way?

871
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,190
What are you doing? Mike?

872
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,696
- Guys, can I get a second with Mike?
- Guys, I'm just going to the...

873
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,120
- Just y'all go ahead. Just go ahead.
- Take all the time you want.

874
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,242
Dude, what is going on?

875
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,621
I cannot do the job that you asked me to do
if you don't allow it.

876
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,543
I got a great time for you, man.
I got some shit set up.

877
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,168
We gonna have a good...
Dom! I told you don't pick no table!

878
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,302
Ladies, shall we?

879
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,843
Damn it!

880
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,273
- Hit me.
- You split those!

881
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:32,023
- You said never split the aces!
- I said always split the aces!

882
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,396
You feeling all right?

883
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,699
Don't be getting in my head,
Randy, all right? Hit it.

884
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,275
Damn it!

885
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,703
Hit me, baby, hit me!

886
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,044
The greens are how much?

887
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,378
Twenty-five.

888
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:59,296
Oh, God! You gotta be kidding me!

889
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,806
Ced, Ced, come on, man.

890
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,053
I'll give you some chips!

891
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:16,938
No!

892
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,658
- This ain't over, Randy.
- I'm here every night, son.

893
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:21,734
This ain't over.

894
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,748
Yes, can I please have a martini, straight up?

895
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:30,327
Come here, come here, come here.
Cancel that.

896
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,245
Candace.

897
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:37,255
Alcohol is the leading cause
of hangovers and bloating.

898
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,340
I am glad I'm not the bride.

899
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,296
Ladies, I've got another surprise.

900
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:47,594
Tickets to see Dionne Warwick tonight,
fifth row center!

901
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,141
Score!

902
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,439
Dionne Warwick?

903
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:56,395
Yeah, you... You told me you
and your mother love Dionne Warwick, right?

904
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,271
Right, but I...

905
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,489
Good, then. It's settled.

906
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,567
Thanks, Candace.

907
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,616
Hanover bridal party is right over there.

908
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,072
- Uncle Eddie?
- Ladies.

909
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,783
Uncle Eddie! What are you doing here?

910
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:14,045
I had to come and toast
my favorite little niece before her big day!

911
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,340
- I got your message.
- Thank you.

912
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,964
Miss Loretta.

913
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:26,178
I'm so sorry to hear about
the untimely passing of Deacon Johnson.

914
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,017
I know what it's like to have loved and lost.

915
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,643
If there's anything,
and I do mean anything I can do to help,

916
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,349
just let me know.

917
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,983
Now, how many times have
you used that line on a woman?

918
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:42,066
I've said it plenty of times to
plenty of women, Miss Loretta.

919
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,028
But it's the first time I've said it to a lady.

920
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:50,407
Excuse me, she also has tickets to
go see Dionne Warwick tonight.

921
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,663
- And no one to go with.
- Nobody.

922
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,335
Dionne Warwick? No kidding.

923
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,456
You know, my church choir
just sang <i>I</i> Say a Little Prayer...

924
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,006
Hallelujah!

925
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,255
If you'd allow me to
buy one of these tickets...

926
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,177
No, no! You can have mine.

927
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,300
- Please.
- Take mine!

928
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,973
Hey, hey, hey!

929
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,686
I'd love to accompany you.

930
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:16,809
<i>How about it's</i> my <i>treat?</i>
I <i>mean, after</i> all, <i>That's What Friends Are For.</i>

931
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,361
Looks like Miss "Whore-etta"
is back in the saddle.

932
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,905
<i>Momentum had suddenly swung
in the girls' direction.</i>

933
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,205
<i>And the guys were about to commit
the first of many turnovers.</i>

934
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,408
Word on the street is, Kristen is trying
to have a baby like right now, J.

935
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:34,784
Right?

936
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,880
Word on the street. Yeah.
No, we're both really excited about it.

937
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:40,957
When you ain't getting no sex,
let's see how excited you are.

938
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,605
- You ain't lying about that!
- "I don't feel sexy right now."

939
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:44,989
You ready for fatherhood or what?

940
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,426
- Fatherhood's gonna be awesome, Jeremy.
- Thanks, Big Mouth.

941
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,428
I think Jeremy's fears are somewhat justified.

942
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,390
Think about it.
How does a child raise a child?

943
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,473
Zeke, really?

944
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:53,895
- Finally!
- You too, Mike?

945
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:57,224
No, my frat brothers.
Isaac and Terrell just got in town.

946
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,729
These two are the biggest party animals
I've ever met.

947
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:03,237
Hopefully, they can contain you.
'Cause you such a wild animal.

948
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:04,739
Maybe you can find a water park.

949
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:07,658
Chef. The tasting menu is exquisite.

950
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,328
My friends and I, we thank you.
It's incredible.

951
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,826
He has to say that.
How about the rest of you?

952
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,166
- How about perfection?
- It's amazing.

953
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,001
Michel, a round of whatever it is they want.

954
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:21,172
So, fellas, if you could spare your friend,
I have a few minutes

955
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,749
if you want a tour of the restaurant.

956
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,254
Lead the way.

957
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,590
I love Ratatouille. It's one of my favorites.

958
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:28,754
So, Dominic,

959
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:32,846
I took a look over your prospectus,
and I must say I'm very impressed.

960
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,965
But I'm not looking to
invest in another restaurant.

961
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,054
Right.

962
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:39,266
'Cause I am opening a new one myself

963
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:42,727
and I'm in the market for a new sous chef.

964
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,278
And I think you are my guy.

965
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,527
Me?

966
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,733
Your new sous chef?

967
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,034
Well, say something.

968
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,454
Are you really offering this to me? Now?

969
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:57,368
Your fusion tapas inspired
a whole new entree,

970
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,918
which is a fancy way of saying I stole them.

971
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,415
I can't believe this is happening.

972
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:04,750
Did I mention my last three sous chefs
went on to create their own restaurants?

973
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,386
- That's the dream.
- And you could be next.

974
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:11,135
They are breaking ground on
the new space at Planet Hollywood.

975
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,558
Why don't you stop and take a look?

976
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,684
Planet Hollywood? Here in Vegas?

977
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,187
Excuse me, Chef?

978
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,228
I really think this can be huge.

979
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:23,684
Yeah.

980
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,187
I'm very excited about this.

981
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,072
Oh, boy.

982
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:39,667
Ladies. You guys.
I'm gonna say goodnight to you now.

983
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,211
Thank you so much for including me
in the day, it was so much fun.

984
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,505
- It was our pleasure.
- Thank you.

985
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,396
Tish, what are you gonna do tonight?

986
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:50,045
Well, I'm gonna have a "mom-cation".

987
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,173
I'm going to play the slots
a little bit by myself

988
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,346
and then I'll just go nose around
the gift shops by myself,

989
00:43:56,425 --> 00:44:00,271
take selfies with the statues by myself.

990
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,599
I don't know,
just like drink alone in my room.

991
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:05,561
It might be a crazy night,
but you're more than welcome to join us.

992
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,940
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah, come.

993
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,191
Fine, <i>I'll</i> do it!

994
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:12,032
I do not wanna be alone in my room in Vegas.

995
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,192
Okay, Tish.

996
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,701
If you're gonna join the bachelorette party,
I have one cardinal rule.

997
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,281
- You must dress up.
- Yeah.

998
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,116
Yeah, because we have to
be able to get into the club.

999
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,543
So you're gonna have to
pull it together a little bit.

1000
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,041
- Like, belt it?
- No.

1001
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,499
You know what? I have a different twin set.

1002
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,506
That's rule number two,
is that you can't wear a twin set ever.

1003
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:31,586
<i>Okay-</i>

1004
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,546
Get a cute little dress and some shoes,
some heels.

1005
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:37,725
These are the highest heels I'm allowed
to wear, because I have rolling arches.

1006
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:41,605
Well, this is all I brought, so I don't know
what else you want me to wear.

1007
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,146
Bebe!

1008
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,769
Come, come, come.

1009
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,091
Shots up!

1010
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,806
To Mike! I'm sending you off the right way.

1011
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:21,136
I'm the best best man anybody can have!

1012
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,083
You want Ceddy, baby?

1013
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,399
Coco, did I ever tell you that
I love a woman in uniform?

1014
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:50,423
Did I tell you I love a woman
without a uniform? Go, Coco!

1015
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,214
Dom. You all right?

1016
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,261
- Yeah, I'm good.
- You been really down since dinner.

1017
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,385
- Seriously, what's up, man?
- Stop babysitting your drink, Dom.

1018
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,681
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1019
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,600
Oh, yes, you are fine.

1020
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:03,969
I think she likes you.

1021
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,971
No, Dom, we can see when the wheels
are turning, man. Come on, out with it.

1022
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,395
Chef Cotillard offered me a job.

1023
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,772
- What did he say?
- The Chef offered him a gig.

1024
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,103
That's huge, Dom!

1025
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,188
- That's a celebration right there.
- Especially if I take it.

1026
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,070
- Why wouldn't you take it?
- It's in Vegas.

1027
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,946
- Lauren and I live in LA.
- This is a pattern with him.

1028
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,402
It's called the Dom Syndrome.

1029
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,738
- It's called, he's officially her bitch.
- That, too.

1030
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:22,788
What are you all talking about?

1031
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,584
We talking about the fact that
she dumped you, and you took her back!

1032
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:26,659
- I know what I want.
- Stop!

1033
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,262
So, now you telling me you gonna give up
the job of your dreams,

1034
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,289
the job that could make you, for that woman?

1035
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:33,374
- For the woman.
- Spoken like a true...

1036
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,504
Do not say it again.

1037
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:35,668
It's actually kinda romantic.

1038
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,253
You swimming in the Kool-Aid.

1039
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,714
What good is a dream job
if he's gonna be miserable?

1040
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,720
Let me ask you a question.
Do you all synchronize your cycles?

1041
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,676
There's an app for that, and I'm serious.

1042
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,057
But wait, I got one question,
then I'ma back off.

1043
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,811
Do you honestly believe that
she would do the same for you?

1044
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,436
Wait a minute!

1045
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:53,110
Good question, Zeke.
How do you do it? Tell me.

1046
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,812
<i>Can we have Coco to the main stage?</i>

1047
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,772
Let me help you down. Jesus.

1048
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,858
Excuse me, Coco. Thank you for the dancing.

1049
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:03,196
It's showtime. My frat brothers,
Isaac and Terrell? They just showed up.

1050
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,371
There they go!

1051
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,831
What's up, man? I'm Cedric.

1052
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,786
I'm the best man with the plan.
What's up, baby?

1053
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,377
Ced, it's not them.

1054
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,714
There they go!

1055
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,502
Birds of a feather all flock together.

1056
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,633
What fraternity did Mike pledge?

1057
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:25,184
Abercrombie and Fitch Epsilon.

1058
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,978
This is Isaac and this is Terrell.

1059
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,933
What kinda white woman
names her son Terrell?

1060
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,351
I'm just messing with you!

1061
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,104
- Chain him up!
- Get it on.

1062
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,022
Guys, guys, guys!

1063
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,797
Why didn't you think of that, Zeke?

1064
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,658
Probably because black men
don't put chains on black men.

1065
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:44,078
White men put chains on black men. Django.

1066
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,655
D is silent. I saw that movie.

1067
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,080
Guys, what's a pickaninny?

1068
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,919
Guys, you gotta meet my frat brothers.
This is Isaac.

1069
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,711
- How are you doing, little guy?
- And this is Terrell, guys.

1070
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:56,758
I've heard so much about you guys,
and none of it is true.

1071
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,549
Where are your drinks, ladies?
Come on! What is this?

1072
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,429
Is this a Shirley Temple and a club soda?

1073
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,825
- Whose bar mitzvah is this?
- You gotta take this night...

1074
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,311
Absolutely.
You and me are gonna die tonight. Let's go.

1075
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:10,813
I told you, you're gonna love these guys.

1076
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:15,768
Yes!

1077
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,483
Come on, Tish!

1078
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:27,367
Girl, those are three-inch heels.

1079
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,868
These shoes are killing me.

1080
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,243
- Miss Harris? I'm JP, your driver.
- Yes?

1081
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,003
Ladies, your ride awaits.

1082
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,918
Wait! This is our ride?

1083
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,123
It is now!

1084
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,710
Wait, you stole the boys' ride?

1085
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:42,085
Genius!

1086
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,347
- After you, ladies!
- I love that!

1087
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:47,892
- How are they gonna get around?
- Who cares? That's not our problem.

1088
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,728
What the hell is this?

1089
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,398
This isn't my ride. I ordered the pimped-out
party bus with a stripper pole in it.

1090
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,066
- It's got a pole.
- Cedric, what the hell is that?

1091
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:57,189
Zeke, don't start, man.

1092
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,066
I'm liking your gay vibe, man.

1093
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,397
Stop. Everybody stop for a second.

1094
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,653
Do we look like a group of guys that's
gonna roll to a spot in something like this?

1095
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,325
As a matter of fact, you do.

1096
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:06,994
Man, this is Vegas. I've seen it all.

1097
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,447
Are you gonna get in the car'?
'Cause you're getting charged regardless.

1098
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,077
Dude, I'm not gonna argue with you.
We walking.

1099
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,958
Ced, you know how long
these Vegas blocks are?

1100
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:15,165
- Let's do it!
- I'm getting in the car, bro.

1101
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,838
20% gratuity is non-refundable.

1102
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,917
<i>The women had not only taken our ride,
they had taken our mojo.</i>

1103
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,673
All right, what's on the agenda?

1104
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,924
Actually, I have about 10 agendas
for us this evening.

1105
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:26,426
I fear them already.

1106
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,223
As you should.

1107
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,722
Okay, the first one is...

1108
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:31,802
Is someone vibrating?

1109
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:35,857
- You're not gonna answer that, are you?
- Put it on silent.

1110
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,854
I have to get this. Hello, Lauren Harris.

1111
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,105
<i>Please hold for Lee Fox.</i>

1112
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:40,528
- Who wants a cocktail?
- Me!

1113
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:41,604
All right.

1114
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,940
That food was garlicky.
You guys got any gum?

1115
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,983
I think I have something in my purse,
side pocket.

1116
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,653
<i>- I'll</i> have one of those.
- I definitely need one.

1117
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:49,953
Me, me, me.

1118
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,207
- And a Benadryl, if you have one.
- Pass me one.

1119
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:58,792
Earthy.

1120
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:00,248
<i>- Lauren, it's Lee.
- Hi, Lee.</i>

1121
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:03,171
All I can say is congratulations.
It's unanimous.

1122
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,049
You're officially COO of
our global media group.

1123
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,715
Did you hear me?

1124
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,800
Yes. I'm...

1125
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:16,602
I'm just, I'm stunned. I'm speechless.

1126
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,524
Welcome to the Big Apple, Lauren Harris.
And to the big leagues.

1127
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,819
Now go, have fun with your bridesmaids.

1128
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:23,521
<i>We'll lunch on Monday.</i>

1129
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,065
Okay, here we go. There you go.

1130
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,784
Are you okay?

1131
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,199
Lauren?

1132
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,788
- Someone's gonna throw up later.
- You're ready to party.

1133
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:34,865
Let's go!

1134
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,743
Vegas!

1135
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,627
- Hello, Sofia. How are you?
- I'm wonderful, Zeke.

1136
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,132
Guys, guys-

1137
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,260
This is the lovely Sofia.
Sofia, this is the boys.

1138
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,057
- Hello.
- Hey.

1139
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,430
- How's it going?
- Easy. Easy.

1140
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,013
- Let's go. Take your time, man.
- Let's give him some space.

1141
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,106
So, how are you?

1142
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:03,270
<i>Zeke had to can a time-out after
running into yet another old flame,</i>

1143
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:06,071
<i>who made it clear
her life was much better without him.</i>

1144
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,525
<i>Turns out that he was still holding on
to the fantasized memories of his past!</i>

1145
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:13,454
<i>But the real question was, if ladies
no longer saw him as Zeke the Freak,</i>

1146
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,076
<i>then who was he?</i>

1147
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,288
Let me ask you something,
how did you let that slip away?

1148
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:20,369
I think I was just an asshole.

1149
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,546
Sometimes, you gotta wait
to find the right woman.

1150
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,623
The perfect woman.
And that's who you marry.

1151
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:27,210
Zeke ain't getting married!
What the hell is going on?

1152
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,546
We here to have a bachelor party, men!

1153
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,009
Can we do that?

1154
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,809
Saying the same thing over and over again
to you all, man.

1155
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:35,975
Nobody answer any phones.

1156
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,728
- Solidarity, brothers!
- I like that.

1157
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,476
Gailzilla ain't gonna mess up
my trip this time.

1158
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,308
<i>What did you call me, Cedric?
You know I can hear you.</i>

1159
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,517
What do you want, Gail?

1160
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:47,606
<i>Why the hell do I have
over $40,000 worth of charges</i>

1161
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:50,567
<i>- on my frozen company credit card?
- What're you talkin' about,</i> 40,000 <i>what?</i>

1162
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,949
<i>You're dead, Cedric. You are dead!</i>

1163
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:55,655
<i>Baby, who you talking to?</i>

1164
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,035
<i>- Who was that'?
- I gotta go.</i>

1165
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,457
<i>- Gail!
- This isn't over.</i>

1166
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,577
Everything all right, C?

1167
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,462
I gotta... God damn it!

1168
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:05,289
Is Gail here?

1169
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,669
Don't worry about it, I'll go get him.

1170
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:08,829
You guys go ahead.
I'll meet you at Planet Hollywood.

1171
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:13,089
This music is so intense!

1172
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:17,180
Yeah. The beat just moved right through me.

1173
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,224
I feel like I'm on a conveyor belt.

1174
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:27,361
These bitches are trippin'!

1175
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:30,360
Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Sorry.

1176
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,401
Hey, Marcel!

1177
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:35,987
Mr. Ward. How can I help you?

1178
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,949
I think there's a little glitch with my bill.

1179
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:40,704
Well, let's have a look, shall we?

1180
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:44,003
I booked the Constantine Villa under
a very special promotion on my gold card

1181
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:45,796
- for 4,000 a night.
- No. "Off."

1182
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,797
I'm sorry, what? Pardon? What'd you say?

1183
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,843
The promotion is for $4,000 discount a night.

1184
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:54,760
Normally, the Constantine is $44,000 a night,

1185
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,308
but with your special promotion,
you are getting an amazing savings.

1186
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:00,603
Plus, you're getting 40,000 gold points.

1187
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,398
I don't give a damn about them gold points.

1188
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,597
You know what, Marcel?

1189
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,308
- Actually, you know what I just realized?
- What?

1190
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,610
- That room is too much. It's too big.
- Too big?

1191
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,070
'Cause it's too big for one person.

1192
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:12,231
It's cold, it's lonely. I can't sleep.

1193
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:17,404
Do you think I can move to a more,
lesser, a more lesser room?

1194
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:20,118
- Smaller room?
- Something smaller, with one bed?

1195
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,328
Absolutely, I can do that for you.

1196
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:27,247
There would be no additional charge since
you are staying in the Constantine tonight,

1197
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,423
which requires our standard
72-hour cancellation.

1198
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,050
Oh, God.

1199
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:35,129
But you know, you know what, Mr. Ward,

1200
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:40,639
I think that we can see to
just charging you for the one night.

1201
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,061
- One night?
- Does that help?

1202
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,137
Yeah.

1203
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,597
Is there something else I can help you with?

1204
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,809
Where is the... Where's the ATM?

1205
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,234
The ATM is right there.

1206
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,061
Marcel, just say it, where?

1207
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:52,863
- To your right.
- Over here?

1208
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,402
- Just right over there.
- Whose is this?

1209
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,601
- This is for guests as they enter.
- Well, I need it.

1210
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,111
Ced, what happened? What are you doing?

1211
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,120
- I gotta win some money, Dom.
- For what?

1212
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,323
- I gotta win money right now.
- Ced, wait! Stop, stop. Talk to me.

1213
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:03,767
- What, Dom, what?
- What happened?

1214
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,702
The room was a lot more
than I expected it to be.

1215
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,411
All right, cool. So, how much?

1216
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,337
$36,000 a night more.

1217
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,381
You ain't got it, Dom.

1218
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,383
My heart, man!

1219
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,088
Give it back, man. Just give it back.

1220
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,338
Ced, one second.

1221
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:20,674
Just tell me what happened.

1222
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:23,477
What do you mean, tell you what happened?
I just told you what happened, Dom!

1223
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,270
Am I speaking Spanish?

1224
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:28,190
- I got you.
- No, you don't got me!

1225
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:30,651
What makes it worse is I put the entire
$40,000 on Gail's company card.

1226
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:34,029
- What did you do that for'?
- You think I meant to do it? Shut up!

1227
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,526
- She gonna kick yo ass.
- No shit, Dom!

1228
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,734
You're saying everything I know,
you making this a lot worse!

1229
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,239
- You think?
- I gotta get my life back and fix it.

1230
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,821
The only way I'ma fix it
is the way I know how.

1231
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,076
I gotta win my money back.

1232
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,783
But Ced, here's the problem. No one ever
wins when they need to in Vegas.

1233
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:49,621
Who are you, Nega-Tron?
I got two words for you, <i>Rain</i> Man.

1234
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,876
<i>Rain Man,</i> right, okay, let me call the guys.

1235
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,837
No, you're not calling nobody!

1236
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,799
This is Michael's day, man.
I'm not gonna ruin this for him, all right?

1237
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,592
And I don't want those guys around me
while I'm gambling!

1238
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,047
They gonna throw off my vibe.

1239
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,803
Now what I need you to do,
I need you to be my friend.

1240
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,388
Be my wing-man right now. Buy me an hour.

1241
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:05,468
All right.

1242
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:06,832
One hour, Dom, that's all I need.

1243
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,940
Heart Bar. Meet us there in one hour.

1244
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,358
- One hour, that's all I need.
- One hour, Ced.

1245
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:14,152
I just told you the time, Dom!
Don't say it no more!

1246
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,531
Stressing me out!

1247
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,238
- What do you think the boys are doing?
- Strip club!

1248
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,746
Michael specifically said that he did not want
one of those skanky Vegas ho weekends,

1249
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,119
and he hates strip clubs.

1250
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:27,199
Girl, they are men!

1251
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,455
And what about his creepy little best man?

1252
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,082
And let's not get started
on his first lieutenant!

1253
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:34,461
I don't give a damn where they're at
or what they're doing

1254
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,464
or if they have stoned sperm
or if they even want kids or not!

1255
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,545
- What did Jeremy do?
- Not me!

1256
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:41,801
He compared me to Louis Gossett Jr.!

1257
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,053
- No!
- Apparently, I'm not fun anymore.

1258
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,055
You are so fun!

1259
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,808
- I know! Exactly! Next round's on me.
- Gotcha.

1260
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:53,734
Speaking of fun, for your challenge
at the Gallery Club, Miss Hall,

1261
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:58,273
you have to dance on a bar,
table or in a go-go cage!

1262
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,356
No!

1263
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,204
You think Jeremy's right?

1264
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:10,876
'Cause they say

1265
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,662
where you're at in your sex life
is where you're at in real life.

1266
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:18,546
What if I'm just controlling, you know?
What if I am a drill sergeant?

1267
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,005
I'm fun, all right?

1268
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,014
I'm fun, okay?

1269
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,227
I'm back, Randy.

1270
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,695
<i>All right.
We're gonna take you guys back to the '90s.</i>

1271
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:24,692
Hey, here you guys are.

1272
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,238
- Cedric okay?
- Yeah, he's good.

1273
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:27,661
Where is my best man?

1274
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:31,081
Still the best.
You guys need another round? It's on me.

1275
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,282
I'm full, man.

1276
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:06,313
Cedric got about two more minutes
and then I'm designating you the best man.

1277
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:07,530
You know what? Let's do some shots!

1278
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:08,610
I gotta pee.

1279
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:09,695
Yeah, hurry back.

1280
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:12,098
Told you not to break the seal.
You'll be peeing all night.

1281
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,473
All right, let's do another shot.

1282
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:41,060
Guys, I'm ready to go downstairs
to see my best man on a table.

1283
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,319
<i>It actually looked like he was up.</i>

1284
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,776
Your bachelor party!

1285
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,709
Stop it!

1286
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:44,082
Sorry I'm not the perfect woman
for your perfect son, Miss "Whore-etta!"

1287
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,716
But I want my white roses, biatch!

1288
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:02,899
Hell, yeah!

1289
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:05,227
They gonna fire you, man!

1290
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,404
You ain't gonna be
able to work here no more.

1291
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:10,779
<i>In other business news,

- Listen to me!
- Dude, it's been an hour!

1299
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,842
Don't come over here
with that negative energy!

1300
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:30,238
Okay? Not right now, man, I'm up!

1301
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,512
I'm up like eight grand,
and I can win a lot more.

1302
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:35,094
Go over there, go throw a ball or something!

1303
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:37,555
Listen! Are you the best man
or the worst man?

1304
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,977
The worst man?

1305
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,178
<i>Okay-</i>

1306
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,356
I don't see any boobs in his face.

1307
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,558
You know what? You're 100% right.

1308
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:48,278
J.Crew and Ralph Lauren are right, man.

1309
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:50,489
Dude, I'm serious, Mike. I've abandoned you.

1310
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:52,316
- You didn't abandon me.
- No, Mike, stop.

1311
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:55,903
I abdicated my duties and my responsibilities
for my own personal wants and needs!

1312
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,784
Cedric, you're good, you just been gambling.

1313
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,456
That's not why you made me best man!

1314
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:01,625
You made me your best man
because I'm responsible.

1315
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,249
And you can trust me,
unlike anybody else here.

1316
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,250
Tomorrow's a new day, gentlemen,
but tonight,

1317
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:09,333
tonight, Cedric is back on duty.
You hear me? Okay?

1318
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:10,918
Let's go, guys!

1319
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,961
And, Randy, it's been a pleasure.

1320
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,629
Right behind you, Bennett.

1321
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:16,260
Go ahead, Zeke. Hey.

1322
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,926
What did I ask you for?
I said buy me some time.

1323
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,730
- I did the best I could!
- I could have had all the money back, Dom!

1324
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,180
Damn!

1325
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:26,813
Guys, it's midnight. It's midnight.
Guys, guys, listen.

1326
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:29,315
And this is not the alcohol talking, guys,

1327
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:32,648
this is the biggest day of my life, gentlemen.

1328
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,317
This is the day I get to marry
the woman of my dreams, man.

1329
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,494
Come here, man. 'Cause I know how you feel.

1330
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:40,618
This is the 15th. This is my wedding day.

1331
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,041
And there's nobody I'd rather be with.

1332
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,618
Mike, you said today's the 15th?

1333
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,796
- Yeah, the day I get to marry Candace.
- Oh, my God, that's a sign.

1334
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:49,919
Mike, stop! I get it.

1335
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:52,296
You're getting married.
People do it every day. Stop.

1336
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,048
This is a sign!

1337
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,300
- Of our love.
- Mike, will you shut up?

1338
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:00,009
Please! Listen, I lost my virginity
when I was 15, okay?

1339
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,183
On the 15th.

1340
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:04,354
Me and Gail have been separated 15 times.
It's a sign!

1341
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,397
God, I get it!

1342
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:07,474
It's a sign!

1343
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,604
Just calm down!

1344
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,150
$10,000 on black 15.

1345
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:16,112
- You're melting down! Get it together!
- Listen to me!

1346
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,944
All that negative energy you're putting
in the air, take it out right now!

1347
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:22,114
This is a sign. $10,000, black 15.
Right now. Move.

1348
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:23,870
$10,000 on 15, table max.

1349
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,043
- Don't nobody talk to me right now.
- We shouldn't let him do this.

1350
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,290
- Cedric, are you serious?
- Zeke, don't talk to me no more.

1351
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:31,590
Somebody say something else to me,
I'm gonna get really upset. It's a sign!

1352
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:32,882
Are you letting him do this?

1353
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,255
Black 15.

1354
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:35,927
- Cedric.
- Black 15.

1355
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,466
Black 15.

1356
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,305
Black 15.

1357
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,179
Black 15!

1358
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,185
Black 15!

1359
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:45,433
No more bets!

1360
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,059
Black 15.

1361
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:48,644
Winner, black 15, winner.

1362
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,644
Yes, yes, yes! I told you!

1363
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,737
$350,000!

1364
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:55,905
I told you!

1365
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:57,899
Cedric.

1366
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,782
- You didn't win.
- Hold on, Zeke. Wait, stop, stop!

1367
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,533
Where's my money? I put $10,000 right there.

1368
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:06,242
I was trying to help you,
so I made a safer bet for you.

1369
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,952
- You did what?
- Remember what you said? Negativity...

1370
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,878
So, I don't get the $350,000?

1371
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:12,706
- Listen to me!
- Do I have $350,000?

1372
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,666
Wait a minute, Ceddy. Take it out of the air.

1373
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,672
Hold on, Zeke. Hold on, man.

1374
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,222
I'm gonna choke you out!

1375
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:24,683
Get your hands off me!

1376
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,560
I'm gonna kill you, Zeke! I'm gonna kill you!

1377
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,021
Get off of me!

1378
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:31,274
I'm good. Get off me. Where's Zeke going?
I just wanna talk to him.

1379
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,101
Zeke, run! He's coming after you!

1380
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,734
<i>It was the third quarter,
and it was still anybody's game.</i>

1381
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:39,858
I can't believe you guys are hungry again.

1382
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:42,114
We need our energy after that performance.

1383
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:44,655
- True.
- Look, it's midnight!

1384
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,998
It's officially your wedding day!

1385
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,409
Oh, my God, it is!

1386
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:51,044
- What's wrong?
- It's all right to have wedding day jitters.

1387
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:55,127
It's not that. I was just thinking, when
you marry someone, you marry their family.

1388
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,300
And I can't marry Miss Loretta. She hates me!

1389
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,048
Hate is a strong word.

1390
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:01,380
- And she is a strong woman!
- She's a bitch.

1391
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,505
Yeah, she is.

1392
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:05,388
And no matter how hard he tries,
with a mother like Loretta,

1393
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:07,390
Michael is always gonna be a mama's boy.

1394
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:10,348
Accept what you cannot change,
or it will destroy you.

1395
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:12,979
My grandma Eleanor told me that
the day I married Bennett,

1396
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:16,232
and it's gotten me through
15 wonderful years of marriage.

1397
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:19,030
I feel like that's so passive!
What, did you just give up?

1398
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,567
I believe that I can affect
change in my relationship.

1399
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:24,156
You can, but you can't change
a man's nature.

1400
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,571
- Exactly.
- She's right.

1401
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:28,866
You can't force a man to do anything.
Gotta let it happen naturally.

1402
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,830
So, basically, I'm just wasting my time.

1403
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:32,549
Nobody's saying you're wasting your time.

1404
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:34,621
You're still mad over
the Zeke the Freak thing.

1405
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,206
Yes! No!

1406
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,963
I'm not mad about that,
it's just, I feel like he's pulling away,

1407
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,968
and every time I talk about this wedding

1408
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,924
or your dress
or the fact that I'm a bridesmaid,

1409
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,883
he gets this look on his face
where he just looks horrified.

1410
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,137
Maybe he's just afraid of being married.

1411
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:50,061
But I never said anything about
getting married, so why would he think that?

1412
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,854
Probably because
all his friends are getting married?

1413
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,353
All men are terrified of getting married,

1414
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,686
because it reminds them of everything
they're never gonna get to do.

1415
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:00,067
"Tish, I think we should try a threesome."

1416
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,114
"Really, Bennett? Do you know what that is?"

1417
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,363
"Yeah, it's when two girls
and a guy freak dance."

1418
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,277
Time out!

1419
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,071
"Is that why you need your inhaler?"

1420
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,248
Ladies, we're not gonna talk
about fear of marriage

1421
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:13,202
a few hours before
my best friend Candace gets married.

1422
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:16,163
- Plus, we have that last dare to complete.
- Yes.

1423
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:21,173
You, my friend, have to get a lap dance
by a hot, sweaty, steamy stripper!

1424
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:26,881
Ladies' night. To the strip club!

1425
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:29,885
<i>Now, while the girls' team
seemed to be coming together,</i>

1426
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:33,518
<i>my team was falling apart.
Look at us! Just stupid.</i>

1427
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,598
- Save me? I'm already saved, Zeke!
- All right, all right!

1428
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:38,185
Guys, stop, stop!
You're ruining my bachelor party.

1429
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:40,148
- He's ruining your bachelor party.
- I'm sorry.

1430
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:41,229
What's up with you?

1431
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,861
You guys said the Constantine Villa
should be more than $4,000 a night?

1432
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,738
Well, it is. It's 40.

1433
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:47,034
- $40,000?
- How, Cedric?

1434
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,112
The day that he asked me to be the best man,
I booked the villa.

1435
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,947
- For forty grand?
- Yes, for forty grand, Zeke.

1436
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,748
You want me to say it again?
You want me to make it worse?

1437
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:54,326
Yeah, but why would you do that?
You was drunk.

1438
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:55,456
You were buying the whole bar drinks.

1439
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:57,253
- You don't think I know what I did?
- No.

1440
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:59,877
Bottom line, I had everything under control.
I had the money on the table.

1441
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,050
I had Gail off my ass and everything.

1442
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,445
- We gotta cut you off. Listen, stop.
- Yeah, I'll hold it.

1443
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,842
- Just give me the damn bottle back.
- You're done. You're done.

1444
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,216
- It's my fault. How do I make it right?
- I don't know, Zeke.

1445
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:10,721
What do you want me to say? I don't know.

1446
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,143
World Series of Beer Pong is at the Flamingo.

1447
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,779
- Do you play?
- Champ of my dorm, baby.

1448
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:17,437
Are you joking?
You don't go to a beer pong at a bachelor...

1449
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,438
Guys, I got it!
I know how we can get the money.

1450
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:20,893
Easy-

1451
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,524
- You kept the stupid flyer?
- Bennett, you're a genius!

1452
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:25,027
Oh, my God. This is it!
The Hustler Club. Ladies Night!

1453
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,983
They're doing a big contest
for amateur male strippers.

1454
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,443
$50,000 in cash and prizes.

1455
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:31,370
This is bullshit. No way
the winner takes home $50,000 in cash.

1456
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:33,573
- Who does this anyway?
- You're wrong, Dom, look.

1457
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:36,789
1st place, $25,000. 2nd place, $15,000.
3rd place, $10,000.

1458
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,379
Great, even if you win and come in first,
you still don't have enough.

1459
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:41,832
Guys, the first three places
add up to $50,000.

1460
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:43,633
- We can do this, guys.
- We?

1461
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,381
Come on, Ced. That's all right.
You've been drinking.

1462
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,679
No, Dom, I'm not tripping.
This has got nothing to do with drinking.

1463
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:49,472
- You're fishing.
- Zeke, you owe me!

1464
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,925
If I ask you to take your little black ass
out there and shake it,

1465
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,136
you, out of all people here,
are gonna shake it!

1466
01:06:54,219 --> 01:06:57,098
This is not fishing, this is reality.
We can pull this off!

1467
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,808
I think we should do it. It could be fun.
You guys have really good bodies.

1468
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:02,565
Baby oil on black skin
always brings out all your muscles.

1469
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,146
Come on, please!

1470
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:05,902
- I say we go for it.
- Thank you.

1471
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,072
- I'd like to male strip.
- Yes.

1472
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,525
I'm not doing it.

1473
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:12,280
We're in Vegas. This is not going home
with us, guys. It's done. It's a one-time thing.

1474
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:13,955
- Come on, y'all.
- Can't do it, man.

1475
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,239
Dom?

1476
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,746
There's no way.

1477
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,711
Absolutely no way in hell
I'm going through with this.

1478
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,664
My mama would kill me if she saw me in this.

1479
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,499
Help me with my fanny-pack.

1480
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,584
- How's my body look in this?
- Awful.

1481
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,054
- What are you supposed to be?
- A sexy hobbit.

1482
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,971
No, I'm a sexy caveman.

1483
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:34,517
Gotta be kidding me. Black Spartacus?

1484
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:35,844
That's a good idea.

1485
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:38,897
All right, fellas.
You got 15 minutes before show time.

1486
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:40,686
Loosen up, bro.

1487
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:43,818
All them ladies gonna eat you alive out there.

1488
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:45,320
Better watch out, Zeke.

1489
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:59,577
I can't believe this is happening.
I'm actually in a strip club.

1490
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:02,045
Girl, please. We ain't doing anything
our men aren't doing.

1491
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,481
Except we're not gonna get caught.

1492
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,247
Look at him.

1493
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:06,837
Okay, the action's down here.

1494
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,593
Trust me, it's not.

1495
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,174
Follow me, ladies.

1496
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,642
Lauren! Do we have to do this?

1497
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:24,726
Yes!

1498
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:27,107
Oh, my God. It's your final dare.
Stop being a mom.

1499
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:30,982
Ladies!

1500
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:36,700
Give it up, give it up.

1501
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:39,074
Come on, ladies!

1502
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:41,659
How hard can it be to impress them?

1503
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:44,500
That is a bunch of drunk
and horny women out there.

1504
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,172
Wild crowd tonight, guys.

1505
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,211
Cute hobbit. Go get them.

1506
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,545
Okay. That guy is a professional.

1507
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:54,965
And this is amateur night, for chrissakes,
you hear me?

1508
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,300
You win by applause.

1509
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,350
Listen up! My first three amateurs, you're on!

1510
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:00,178
Our outfits are gonna be better.

1511
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:04,019
Look at that pork chop.

1512
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,691
- Oh, shit.
- It's a setup.

1513
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,019
Man, those are ringers.

1514
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:10,313
<i>Competing for $50,000 in cash...</i>

1515
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:11,943
Take your pants off!

1516
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:14,117
<i>...Sexy Santa and his little helper.</i>

1517
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,239
<i>Come on, ladies!</i>

1518
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,908
<i>Come on, ladies, let me hear you!</i>

1519
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:24,623
<i>Are you ready?</i>

1520
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,080
<i>I said, "Are you ready?"</i>

1521
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,883
<i>Ladies, this is the moment
you've been waiting for.</i>

1522
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,638
<i>Do we have any bachelorettes in the house?</i>

1523
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:35,801
<i>- Any bachelorettes in the house?
- Yes, over</i> here!

1524
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,726
<i>We're only gonna bring one,
one lucky bachelorette to the stage</i>

1525
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,053
<i>for a lap dance from Santa.</i>

1526
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,599
<i>Can I get a Candace?
Do we have a Candace in the house?</i>

1527
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,400
<i>Candace, come up on stage.</i>

1528
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:50,482
Come on!

1529
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,738
<i>Fellas, go get Candace.</i>

1530
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,325
Go, yes, take her!

1531
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:58,236
<i>Give it up for Candace, ladies.</i>

1532
01:09:58,403 --> 01:09:59,655
Good one, Lauren.

1533
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:01,494
Yeah, I got her good, didn't I?

1534
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,376
<i>Come on, ladies, let me hear you.</i>

1535
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:10,423
<i>- Come on, ladies, let me hear you!
- Lauren!</i>

1536
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,501
One more time, from the top, okay?

1537
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:15,344
Five, six.

1538
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,422
Five, six, seven, eight.

1539
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:22,094
And step. And snap it.
Get lower, like Beyoncé.

1540
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,433
Right here. You gotta do this.
This is what they want.

1541
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,222
- And then back it up.
- That's your boy.

1542
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:28,391
It's like you got a chance
to put it right in they face.

1543
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:30,310
Here it is. Took it away.

1544
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:31,815
You don't have to do this.

1545
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,234
We do have to do this,
because we took an oath, Michael.

1546
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:36,775
- Another one?
- Come on.

1547
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:40,779
You promised!

1548
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,704
Y'all see that right there?
It's not gonna be that bad, man.

1549
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:47,289
Just keep thinking $50,000.

1550
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:50,376
<i>Ladies, let's help her out. Candace! Candace!</i>

1551
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:57,549
I know a Candace.

1552
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:00,097
Where are you going? One more shot!

1553
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:08,139
Candace!

1554
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:09,649
"Kansas"?

1555
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:11,275
Get off my girl!

1556
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:12,977
Michael?

1557
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,313
That's my girl right there.
Get your hands off me!

1558
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,155
Michael's fighting!

1559
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,073
Oh, my God.

1560
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:28,659
Get off her!

1561
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,507
That's my friend!

1562
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,094
Stop!

1563
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:40,839
Michael!

1564
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,222
I got you!

1565
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:48,471
Get off of her!

1566
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:55,686
Stay down, all right?

1567
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:57,779
- Really, dude?
- Shit.

1568
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:58,856
No!

1569
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:04,453
Bar fight!

1570
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:13,713
Michael!

1571
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:24,010
<i>The story you are about to see is true.</i>

1572
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:28,011
<i>The names have been changed
to protect the innocent.</i>

1573
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:39,731
<i>So the fourth quarter began with
both teams on a downward spiral.</i>

1574
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:40,989
Dom, slow down.

1575
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,567
Wait. Mike, wait, wait.

1576
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:44,327
- What?
- Wait, wait.

1577
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:45,995
Slow down.

1578
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,664
Look, while we're in here right now,

1579
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:50,579
I don't want nobody...

1580
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:54,651
All right. Everybody all right?

1581
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,338
- It's a door.
- Okay, listen to me.

1582
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,841
Don't nobody say nothing to nobody in here.

1583
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,843
- You keep your mouths shut.
- That's a good idea.

1584
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:02,118
You let me do all the talking.

1585
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:04,176
- Hell, no.
- What do you mean?

1586
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:05,939
Why would we let you do all the talking?

1587
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,013
Because I'm a Season 1 holder of OZ.

1588
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:10,598
- Yes. Have you seen it?
- I've seen it.

1589
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,180
- Have you seen Season 1?
- No.

1590
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:13,986
Exactly, so you don't have the knowledge.

1591
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:15,358
Why don't you just have my back one time?

1592
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,189
- Talk some sense into him.
- Don't talk no sense into me!

1593
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,952
Zeke's gonna blow this whole damn thing.

1594
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,944
Now look, we'll...
Oh, my God, Bennett, did you just fart?

1595
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,403
I'm nervous.

1596
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,030
Okay. You...

1597
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:26,869
Listen to me. Listen to me right now.

1598
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:28,905
On the count of three, I'm going in. Okay?

1599
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:32,291
One, two...

1600
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,576
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1601
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:34,660
Three.

1602
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:36,746
Everybody, listen up!

1603
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,915
What I need to know

1604
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,296
is who's the boss in here?

1605
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:44,546
Whatever you're thinking right now is wrong.

1606
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:48,641
You know why it's wrong?
'Cause the new boss just walked in.

1607
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:50,384
That's right!

1608
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,394
Me and my crew.

1609
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:54,806
We just took this over. You got that?

1610
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:59,148
It's a sign of respect.

1611
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:00,436
Mercy, please.

1612
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,609
- Mercy.
- Mercy, please.

1613
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:04,399
Mercy, please. We're sorry.

1614
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,158
You want the cube, you got it.

1615
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:07,994
We don't need this cube.

1616
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:11,076
Where was y'all at? Why you up there, Dom?

1617
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:15,494
<i>One thing that never occurred to any of
the players was that both teams could lose.</i>

1618
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,503
Come on, ladies, keep it moving.

1619
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,288
Let's go.

1620
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:26,162
I'm not mentally prepared to
be someone's bottom bitch.

1621
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,384
You know we're probably
all getting Chlamydia

1622
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,091
from sitting on these benches, right?

1623
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:32,305
You know you're all thinking about it.

1624
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:36,143
My first official photo on my wedding day

1625
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:38,186
is a mug shot!

1626
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:39,771
This is bad.

1627
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,527
This is really bad.

1628
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:46,945
<i>Dionne Warwick in concert.</i>

1629
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:49,527
<i>How 'bout that
Do You Know the Way to San Jose?</i>

1630
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:51,287
Yes, I do.

1631
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:56,576
I had the time of my life, Eddie.

1632
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:58,002
So did I.

1633
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:01,209
So...

1634
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:03,541
But it doesn't have to end.

1635
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:06,343
I could use a nightcap.

1636
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:10,848
Eddie. Eddie, listen.

1637
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,054
I'm an old-fashioned girl.

1638
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:18,140
I don't go in for flings and affairs
and one-night stands.

1639
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:19,557
I understand.

1640
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,067
So

1641
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:24,987
I'm gonna say good night.

1642
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,902
I'm gonna say good night, too.

1643
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,233
Good night.

1644
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:31,954
- Good <i>night.
- So let me get this straight.</i>

1645
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,037
You're gonna use your one phone call
to call your mother.

1646
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,698
She's gonna get us out of here fast, watch.

1647
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:36,782
Anything?

1648
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:39,745
No, my mom's phone
keeps going to voice-mail.

1649
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,959
- Who else?
- Uncle Eddie.

1650
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,920
<i>It's Loretta. Please leave a message.</i>

1651
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:46,372
Who am I supposed to call?

1652
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,504
Hello? Hi, could I talk to Kanye?

1653
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:51,339
Can you just tell him to get on the phone?

1654
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:53,599
No, I'm still not gonna call him Yeezus.

1655
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,385
Mom, if you get this message...

1656
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,269
What you mean, where am I at?
Where the hell are you at?

1657
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:58,345
Who's this?

1658
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:00,352
Hell, no! I know
there ain't that bitch in the background.

1659
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,592
Listen, I'm in the Clark County jail.
Come bail me out.

1660
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:08,824
That's a rude way to answer the phone.
I don't know anybody's number.

1661
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:10,111
It went to her voice-mail.

1662
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,947
I'm getting a new assistant, she's fired.

1663
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:13,910
Honestly, I don't know
anybody's phone number.

1664
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:17,369
It's programmed in my phone.
Who dials a number anymore?

1665
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,704
Hello? Hey, Jonah.

1666
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:24,960
Put Nana on the phone.

1667
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,215
She's asleep? No, don't wake her up.

1668
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:30,135
No, there's nothing underneath the bed.
I checked before I left. What?

1669
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:33,047
What do we do when we're scared?
What time is it?

1670
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,799
What time is it?

1671
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:36,467
It's game time!

1672
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:39,228
Any dogs in the house?
Any dogs in the house?

1673
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,557
Alls we need is each other!
Alls we need is each other!

1674
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:44,942
'Kay, feel better?

1675
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,314
All right, I love you.

1676
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,279
We're next, let's go.

1677
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,569
'Sup, Ray? So, you pretend to be Ray Lewis?

1678
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:58,160
For my kids, I'll be Ray Lewis, Jerry Lewis,
or Emmanuel Lewis if it helps.

1679
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:01,083
- But how do you know it's gonna work?
- I don't, I'm just winging it.

1680
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:05,505
My kids just want to know their dad's
got their back. It's not rocket science.

1681
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:10,004
- It was a good Ray Lewis.
- Thanks.

1682
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:11,381
I can't believe
you're making me do this right now.

1683
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,821
It's the only number you remember.

1684
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:15,090
- 'Cause I tried so hard to forget...
- Dial.

1685
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:17,175
- Not right.
- Dial.

1686
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,603
<i>Hello?</i>

1687
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:26,226
- Who is this and where is Gail?
- She's preoccupied right now. So...

1688
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:29,111
- Preoccupied? What...
- Yeah, <i>it</i> means <i>busy.</i>

1689
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:31,280
Wait a minute, hold on.
Say "preoccupied" again.

1690
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:32,447
<i>Preoccupied.</i>

1691
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:33,615
Is this Drake?

1692
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,693
<i>Dude, why you picking up
Gail's phone, man?</i>

1693
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:38,120
This is... This must be Cedric.

1694
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:40,869
Actually, I'll tell you one thing.
You definitely sound the way you look.

1695
01:17:40,948 --> 01:17:42,988
That's not meant to be taken
as a compliment either.

1696
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:45,707
At the end of the day, you're light-skinned,
so if I hit you it's gonna show.

1697
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:48,960
<i>- Listen,</i> I'll <i>get Gail to call you back,</i> okay?
<i>- You won't get Gail to do anything.</i>

1698
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:50,962
- That's actually up for debate.
- You know, Drake, honey...

1699
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:54,136
- I'm gonna put the phone down now.
- Put this phone down, I'm gonna...

1700
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:55,296
Hello?

1701
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:57,677
<i>I'm re-thinking the bedroom chaise lounge.</i>

1702
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:59,971
I like the way you say chaise. Chaise lounge.

1703
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,977
I never really noticed
how nice of a word that is.

1704
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:03,099
Gail!

1705
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:06,979
<i>If you give that light-skinned nigga
some ass... Gail, I know you hear me!</i>

1706
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:07,103
Break!

1707
01:18:07,104 --> 01:18:08,817
Break!

1708
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:11,863
This was all his idea, not mine.

1709
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:13,489
He just had to have a Vegas wedding.

1710
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:15,524
I wanted to stay in LA, you know.

1711
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,489
I can't believe we're still here.

1712
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:19,331
- Just try to relax.
- Come here. Sit down.

1713
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:20,495
I can't!

1714
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:22,907
Between us and the guys,
I'm sure somebody's already on their way.

1715
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:24,916
Ladies, elbows stay on the table,
no cheating.

1716
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:28,420
Winner! Next!

1717
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:31,586
- Damn, Sonia, you said you had her.
- You get her then!

1718
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:34,172
My fiancée is spending
her wedding day in prison.

1719
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:36,337
That's my fault. You know, I'm just bad luck.

1720
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:38,471
I'm like Mister from The Color Purple.
I'm cursed.

1721
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:39,547
For real.

1722
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:41,843
I mean, maybe
I just want it too bad, you know?

1723
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:43,386
- Dreamed too big.
- You did.

1724
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:44,929
- Tried to fly too high.
- Way too high.

1725
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:46,438
I let you down, man.

1726
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:48,895
But understand something.
I was just trying to be the best best man.

1727
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:51,561
But, you know what, Isaac, you were right.
I am not the best best man.

1728
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,445
- I am the worst best man.
- Yeah.

1729
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:54,764
Let's take it a step further.

1730
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,949
- I'm the worst best man ever.
- Yeah.

1731
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:00,908
I Kind of felt like that's where
y'all were supposed to jump in and say,

1732
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,990
- "No, Ced. It's not that bad."
- It is that bad.

1733
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:06,079
We're in jail. Look at us, man.
Look at my pants.

1734
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,202
Mike, I told you don't pick them pants,
so, don't put that on me.

1735
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:11,209
This is not how it was supposed to be.
I mean, tonight was crazy...

1736
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:12,840
- It was awesome.
- It was epic.

1737
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:16,344
I'm supposed to be getting married
in a few hours.

1738
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:19,171
All I wanted to do was hang with my boys.

1739
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,850
I didn't want some wild
and crazy Vegas weekend.

1740
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:26,771
Michael, you gotta realize that
the night is just way...

1741
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:30,479
Think about the after-party, too.

1742
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:32,769
Oh, my God, fellas. The after-party.

1743
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,815
- I can't call and cancel that now.
- Seriously?

1744
01:19:34,937 --> 01:19:36,655
- Seriously, what?
- That's where you go?

1745
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:38,987
- It's one note with this dude.
- What do you mean I'm one note, Zeke?

1746
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:41,615
- You haven't heard one thing Michael said.
- I just lost $40,000, Zeke!

1747
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:42,866
- Fail.
- What does that mean?

1748
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:44,066
- You fail.
- Okay, you fail.

1749
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:45,674
- You are fired.
- I don't work for you.

1750
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,700
I just hired you and guess what? I fired you.

1751
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,161
Cedric, just stop, man. We've had enough.

1752
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:51,829
It's not about you, it's about Mike.

1753
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:54,499
It's been about Michael and Candace
this whole weekend.

1754
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:57,794
- No one flew in town for you. Enough.
- I was about to say the same thing...

1755
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,673
Look, it's still your big day,

1756
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,758
and I promise you
we're gonna do everything in our power

1757
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:08,187
to get you out of here
and to your wedding on time.

1758
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:09,354
You're gonna marry her.

1759
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,375
Oh, my God.

1760
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:40,635
Jesus Christ!

1761
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:42,429
Lord have mercy.

1762
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:46,392
Good morning.

1763
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,387
Good morning.

1764
01:20:52,473 --> 01:20:53,895
Wait a minute.

1765
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:57,569
<i>Hey, Mom, it's me, Michael.
Listen, I'm in the Clark County jail.</i>

1766
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:58,896
Oh, my God, we have to go.

1767
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:01,402
Wake up! Wake up!

1768
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:04,865
We're still in prison!
Wake up, Sonia! Wake up!

1769
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:07,238
Mya! Mya, wake up!

1770
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:09,073
No, this can't be happening.

1771
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:11,249
Wake up! Wake up! Guys!

1772
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:13,327
Bennett, wake up.

1773
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,832
Jerm, Jerm, Jerm! Guys!

1774
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:17,005
Wake up! Excuse me, sir.

1775
01:21:17,164 --> 01:21:19,587
Tish, wake up!

1776
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:21,836
Oh, God, let me out!

1777
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:24,009
Please! Oh, my God, please! Let me out!

1778
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:26,720
I'm supposed to get married in three hours!

1779
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:29,222
I'm supposed to be in hair and makeup.

1780
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:30,348
Please!

1781
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:33,031
- Dom, you said you'd get us out of here.
- Yeah. We'll get out.

1782
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:34,352
Well, what time is it?

1783
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:36,441
Let's go, ladies. You just made bail.

1784
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,068
We made bail!

1785
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,275
Oh, my God, come on! Let's go!

1786
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:41,855
Thanks.

1787
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:43,274
We made bail!

1788
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:45,359
- We're free!
- Please don't leave me, guys!

1789
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:46,618
We're free!

1790
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:47,949
Oh, my God!

1791
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:54,121
- Thanks for holding the door open.
- Oh, my God.

1792
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:55,764
- Where's Michael?
- He's right there.

1793
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:58,205
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on him?

1794
01:21:58,372 --> 01:21:59,624
There's your boy right there.

1795
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:01,633
- Mom, I'm right here.
- Oh, my God! Michael.

1796
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,135
- They hurt you?
- No, I'm fine.

1797
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,796
- Where are your clothes?
- Thank you!

1798
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:06,964
Thank you.

1799
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:09,133
This is probably your fault!

1800
01:22:09,299 --> 01:22:10,346
Oh, my God!

1801
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:13,303
Can you believe this?

1802
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:17,349
Tish?

1803
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,714
- Baby, that's not how I raised you.
- They're my friends.

1804
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:21,478
Oh, God, give me strength.

1805
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:25,650
- Michael.
- Baby, I'm so sorry.

1806
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:31,489
Hello! We have a wedding to get to, people!
Come on!

1807
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:33,828
Guys, let's go!

1808
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:42,590
Sorry!

1809
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,002
- We're almost there!
- Hurry up!

1810
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:53,844
Quiet!

1811
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:55,645
Where have you been?
I've been calling you all morning.

1812
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,647
- What's going on?
- You missed your time slot.

1813
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,854
I told you, you had to be here on time.

1814
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,737
Let me handle this.

1815
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:08,033
Look, miss, there has to be something
you can do to help us.

1816
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:11,366
Is there another location you can offer?
Anything. Please.

1817
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,951
This is our busiest month for weddings
and everything's booked solid.

1818
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:17,789
I've already checked.
I'll keep trying, but it's gonna take a miracle.

1819
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:21,209
There's gotta be something that you can do.

1820
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:22,668
I'm sorry.

1821
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:34,976
Sorry, man.

1822
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,233
Not now.

1823
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:07,551
You wanna do <i>Baby Boy?</i>

1824
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,382
Yeah, Jody!

1825
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:12,025
- You gonna clean the house?
- I'm gonna clean the house, Jody.

1826
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:15,347
- You gonna make me dinner?
- I'm gonna make you fajitas, Jody.

1827
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:19,434
No, it's... No, it's tacos. You make tacos.
I mean, she makes me tacos.

1828
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:21,599
Who cares?

1829
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,938
I just wanna be accurate
if we're gonna role play.

1830
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:27,105
But I don't like calling you Jody.
I'm sorry. It skeeves me out.

1831
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:29,945
And your fanny-pack
is digging into my groin.

1832
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:32,405
- His real name is Tyrese.
- I'm gonna call you Tyrese.

1833
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:33,694
- Tyrese?
- Yes.

1834
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:36,955
Take off your fanny-pack, Tyrese!
It's killing me!

1835
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:42,123
If there was ever a time to chill out,
now would be it.

1836
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:45,714
That's a great idea.

1837
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:52,846
Guess you girls really did get
your freak on last night?

1838
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,218
Well done.

1839
01:24:54,298 --> 01:24:55,641
They did.

1840
01:24:57,217 --> 01:25:00,812
Which totally explains
how everything went sideways last night.

1841
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:02,806
<i>So</i> sideways.

1842
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:06,060
You know, Jeremy,
I've been thinking about what you said

1843
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:08,942
about me being a drill sergeant.

1844
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:12,366
- Babe, I'm so sorry. I was being a jerk.
- You were absolutely right.

1845
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:15,786
I don't wanna force anything,
especially not a baby.

1846
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:17,363
I think we should just
take the pressure off ourselves.

1847
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:19,073
Absolutely.

1848
01:25:19,156 --> 01:25:22,160
No, I love us without the pressure,

1849
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:26,088
and if a baby comes out of that,

1850
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:27,506
I'm ready.

1851
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:31,510
- Really?
- Yeah.

1852
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:35,715
In fact, I'm ready right now.

1853
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:41,103
Babe, don't you think
we should get a little sleep?

1854
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,097
Khal Drogo no need sleep.

1855
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:44,397
Khal Drogo need woman.

1856
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:47,814
I just hope you're still, you know,
of optimum ovulation, 'cause

1857
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:49,944
I'm feeling pretty good.

1858
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,647
No, babe. That's not how it works.

1859
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:55,780
It's like the first day of my last period
and then you gotta count a couple weeks.

1860
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,783
And your last period was five weeks ago
at Comic-Con, right?

1861
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:02,495
Five weeks? No, that can't be right, can it?

1862
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:07,378
What?

1863
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:10,041
I'm a week late.

1864
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:14,136
You having a baby?

1865
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:15,879
Possibly.

1866
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:18,557
- Possibly?
- I've been stressed,

1867
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:19,849
so that can totally throw it off.

1868
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:21,848
Are you possibly having our baby?

1869
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:27,684
Is our Halle-Tiger-Jeter baby
possibly in there right now?

1870
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:29,109
Is my baby having my baby?

1871
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:33,814
<i>Okay-</i>

1872
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:39,119
No matter what,
I never want us to stop being us.

1873
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:41,446
Deal.

1874
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:52,837
<i>In relationships, you score when
you relax your demands on your spouse</i>

1875
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:53,963
<i>and yourself.</i>

1876
01:26:58,004 --> 01:26:59,802
I should be talking to somebody,

1877
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:03,055
calling somebody,
using my connections, something.

1878
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:05,354
You got a lot of those.

1879
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:07,272
When were you gonna tell me, Lauren,

1880
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:09,270
about this big promotion in New York City?

1881
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,227
I saw it on television, Lauren.

1882
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:14,233
Dominic, they were not supposed
to release anything until...

1883
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:15,734
Well, it got leaked.

1884
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:17,441
Okay, baby. I can explain.

1885
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:20,903
You took a job in New York City
without talking to me?

1886
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:22,033
Dominic, it's complicated.

1887
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,956
Yeah, it is complicated.

1888
01:27:25,031 --> 01:27:26,624
I got a job offer, too, Lauren.

1889
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:27,792
What?

1890
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:31,088
Chef Cotillard asked me to be the new
sous chef in the restaurant he's opening.

1891
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:32,585
That could jump start your career.

1892
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:34,587
- I was going to turn it down.
- Why would you do that?

1893
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:35,883
'Cause it's in Vegas.

1894
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,006
And the woman I love

1895
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:40,589
and I wanna spend the rest of my life with
lives in Los Angeles.

1896
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:43,353
And I just didn't think
there was anything more important than that.

1897
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:46,186
- I can't go through this again.
- Dominic, stop.

1898
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:47,854
I turned down the job, too.

1899
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:49,063
What?

1900
01:27:49,139 --> 01:27:52,769
I called Lee Fox back
and I told him I couldn't accept it.

1901
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:55,896
Why?

1902
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:58,489
Let's see.

1903
01:27:58,565 --> 01:28:02,911
Well, the second reason
is because the man I love

1904
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:06,957
and want to spend the rest of my life with
lives in LA.

1905
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:11,411
What's the first?

1906
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:13,463
I love his cooking.

1907
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,595
<i>Sacrificing to make your relationship work</i>

1908
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:22,843
<i>is as sweet as an off-balance fadeaway
at the top of the key.</i>

1909
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:26,848
<i>I do it all the time. The jump-shot, that is.</i>

1910
01:28:26,927 --> 01:28:28,929
<i>Well, for Zeke it wasn't going to be that easy.</i>

1911
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:31,098
<i>He was up against a full-court press.</i>

1912
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:32,770
<i>Nobody likes a trap.</i>

1913
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:34,021
Mya.

1914
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,818
I've been texting you, calling you.

1915
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:38,022
You couldn't just let me know
you were okay?

1916
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:39,276
I needed some space.

1917
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:41,275
You know, Mya,
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

1918
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:43,110
Yeah, Zeke.
I've been doing a lot of thinking, too.

1919
01:28:43,193 --> 01:28:44,673
Please, let me get this off my chest.

1920
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:48,619
I want us to be together.

1921
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:52,077
But you weren't honest with me
about your past. Come on, you know it.

1922
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,333
Okay, I give you that.
But let me just explain why.

1923
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,881
I already know why.
It's the whole "Zeke the Freak" thing.

1924
01:28:58,041 --> 01:28:59,088
You just can't let it go.

1925
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:02,637
No, Mya, it's everybody else
who can't let it go. Okay, I admit,

1926
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:06,182
it's childish and it has been
part of my identity for way too long.

1927
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:08,386
But, Mya, I am so past that. You...

1928
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:18,820
- Oh, shit. This water's cold.
- What are you doing?

1929
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:21,523
Listen, I learned something about myself.

1930
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:24,405
I'm not that guy anymore.
I don't wanna be that guy anymore, Mya.

1931
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:25,986
I know who I wanna be.

1932
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:27,912
And who's that, Zeke?

1933
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:29,114
I wanna be your husband.

1934
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:33,459
And why now?

1935
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:37,381
Mya, I have known for a while
that I can give myself to you

1936
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:39,924
completely, no hesitation, without regret.

1937
01:29:40,584 --> 01:29:42,837
I've just been waiting for
the right moment to ask you.

1938
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:44,592
Will you please

1939
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:48,429
marry me?

1940
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:55,724
Is that an... That's an answer?

1941
01:29:56,182 --> 01:29:57,980
- Yes.
- Yes?

1942
01:29:58,059 --> 01:29:59,436
Yes, yes.

1943
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:00,854
Yes!

1944
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:07,614
Oh, my gosh.

1945
01:30:13,617 --> 01:30:15,164
It's beautiful.

1946
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:22,463
You know, there's a bridge on the other side
that you could have used.

1947
01:30:26,212 --> 01:30:28,715
<i>You score by understanding
that you can't move forward</i>

1948
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:30,892
<i>until you both let go of the past.</i>

1949
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:33,140
<i>You hear that, Gail? Let the shit go!</i>

1950
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:43,108
Michael?

1951
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:51,075
I am looking for my son.

1952
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:54,783
He's down at the concierge,
still looking for venues.

1953
01:30:55,617 --> 01:30:59,247
You know, Candace,
maybe this is for the best.

1954
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:03,838
Sometimes we have to read
the signs in our lives.

1955
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,679
Now if you really loved my son
you'd go back there,

1956
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:10,257
finish packing and set him free.

1957
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:16,268
I am ending this conversation right now,
Miss Loretta,

1958
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:21,978
because if I say another word,
we will both regret it.

1959
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:26,190
You got that right. Both will regret it.

1960
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:51,923
What was that?

1961
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:55,226
How dare you talk to my fiancée like that?

1962
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:58,054
Who do you think you're talking to,
Michael Hanover?

1963
01:31:58,471 --> 01:31:59,723
I have no idea.

1964
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:02,851
I would say that you're my mom,
a woman that I love

1965
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:06,404
and admire more than anyone else,
but I don't know who this woman is.

1966
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:11,448
Because this mean, vindictive person
that you are right now,

1967
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:12,966
that's not the woman that raised me.

1968
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:15,330
And what you need to do right now

1969
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:18,784
is you need to walk into that room
and apologize to Candace.

1970
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:22,838
You know damn well
I'm not gonna go in there and apologize.

1971
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:23,913
Fine.

1972
01:32:24,748 --> 01:32:27,592
But please be clear,
you're no longer invited to our wedding.

1973
01:32:29,419 --> 01:32:30,762
I love that woman

1974
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,510
and I'm gonna marry her
whether you like it or not.

1975
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:44,901
It had to be said.

1976
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:49,731
True.

1977
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:55,825
And, baby, I respect and love you so much
for standing up for me like that.

1978
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:02,577
But I can't marry you, Michael.

1979
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:04,954
Not like this.

1980
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:09,001
Baby, this is no way to start a life together.

1981
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:10,293
What are you saying?

1982
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:14,677
You have to go in there
and apologize to your mother right now.

1983
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:17,805
Hell, no. She should be apologizing to you.

1984
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:19,511
Why are you defending her?

1985
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:24,357
Because I am a mother, Michael,

1986
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:27,857
and I love my son
more than anything in the world,

1987
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:31,907
and I can't even imagine the pain I would feel

1988
01:33:31,981 --> 01:33:35,155
if Duke told me
I wasn't invited to his wedding.

1989
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:37,070
So you know what? She may never like me.

1990
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:40,874
She may never think
that I am good enough for her son but,

1991
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:42,576
what mother does?

1992
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:46,622
She has her flaws, Michael, yes.

1993
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:49,548
But she is the reason that you have become

1994
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,468
the man that you are

1995
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:56,174
and the man that I love so much.

1996
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:59,930
But she should still be apologizing to you.

1997
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:01,936
She won't, Michael.

1998
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:05,602
She is a proud woman.

1999
01:34:05,682 --> 01:34:09,528
Which means it is your place
to walk in there and say...

2000
01:34:09,602 --> 01:34:11,070
I'm sorry.

2001
01:34:15,733 --> 01:34:17,235
I was out of line.

2002
01:34:22,282 --> 01:34:24,455
You're right, Candace.

2003
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:28,459
I never thought
you were good enough for my son.

2004
01:34:30,874 --> 01:34:31,875
Until now.

2005
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:38,298
I'm sorry.

2006
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:40,551
Come here.

2007
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:45,730
<i>When you insist on the right way
instead of your own way</i>

2008
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:47,478
<i>nine times out of 10, you score.</i>

2009
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:52,020
<i>That's the thing about Vegas.</i>

2010
01:34:52,645 --> 01:34:57,492
<i>When you're up, you're up,
and when you're down, you are down.</i>

2011
01:34:57,567 --> 01:34:59,786
Brought you a little pick-me-up
before you leave, sir.

2012
01:34:59,861 --> 01:35:04,332
Not in the mood, Declan. I messed up.
I messed up big this time.

2013
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:06,159
I had one job to do.

2014
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:09,462
"Cedric, can you be my best man?"
Couldn't even do that right.

2015
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:12,211
Even though I wasn't really asked like that,
the point is I was the best man.

2016
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:14,610
Instead of providing a good time,
I messed up a great time.

2017
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:17,545
The bachelor party, the after-party.

2018
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:20,223
That's nice. Prison.

2019
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:22,016
- The pillow, sir?
- I like the color.

2020
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:23,680
Please don't take the lamp.

2021
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,764
Everything is my...

2022
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:32,109
It's all my fault.

2023
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:37,274
Well, I can't deny you've been
a bit of a silly-billy, sir,

2024
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:40,827
but we British believe
it's always darkest before the dawn.

2025
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:42,654
Now, speaking of dark,

2026
01:35:43,112 --> 01:35:44,785
have you thought about a night wedding?

2027
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:48,376
You know, when you've worked in this hotel
as long as I have,

2028
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:50,124
you get to know every nook and cranny,

2029
01:35:50,203 --> 01:35:54,549
and there is one picturesque little spot
that I've always thought that

2030
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:58,094
if ever there was to be a Mrs. Declan,
I would tie the knot there.

2031
01:35:58,544 --> 01:36:00,763
I do believe that
I might be able to arrange something.

2032
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:03,466
- Really?
- Perhaps you'd like to call your friends

2033
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:06,052
and tell them not to leave quite so soon.

2034
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:10,015
And in the meantime,
I've got some magic to work, sir.

2035
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:12,977
- Declan, you dog.
- Woof, woof, sir.

2036
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:17,689
<i>And just like that, I was back in the game.</i>

2037
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:20,025
<i>The best man with the game-saving plan.</i>

2038
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:28,333
Because the institution of marriage

2039
01:36:28,408 --> 01:36:30,877
is not to be entered into
unadvisedly or lightly,

2040
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:32,249
but reverently and soberly.

2041
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:33,420
Too late for that.

2042
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:37,251
Therefore, if anyone here has reasons
why these two should not be married,

2043
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:40,007
speak now, or forever hold your peace.

2044
01:36:46,009 --> 01:36:47,306
What y'all looking at?

2045
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:52,181
Proceed.

2046
01:36:52,765 --> 01:36:54,062
Do you have the rings?

2047
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:56,148
The rings.

2048
01:36:57,270 --> 01:37:00,031
- The ring. No, you put them in your pocket.
- Did I give them to you?

2049
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:01,065
I didn't put them in my pocket.

2050
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:03,652
- In your right pocket. Right there.
- No, I don't know where I put them at.

2051
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:05,328
I got it. I have it. I'm sorry.

2052
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:08,493
You really are the best best man, Ced.

2053
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:13,749
The couple would now
like to exchange their vows.

2054
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:19,376
With this ring, I vow to be a loyal husband,

2055
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:20,881
a constant friend,

2056
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:26,053
and a devoted father to our son, Duke.

2057
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:32,647
I vow to love, honor, cherish and adore you.

2058
01:37:32,722 --> 01:37:35,441
Baby, I'm going to adore you forever.

2059
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:40,321
With this ring,

2060
01:37:41,314 --> 01:37:42,736
I vow to love you

2061
01:37:43,566 --> 01:37:45,568
in good times and in bad times,

2062
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:47,904
in sickness and in health.

2063
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:51,498
I promise to be in your corner

2064
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:57,297
and by your side forever and ever and ever.

2065
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:01,505
I heard the whole group of them went to jail
the other night. The groom...

2066
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:04,905
Girl, you ain't gotta shush me.
I'm just telling the truth.

2067
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:06,589
<i>S'[OP-</i>

2068
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:08,800
<i>Okay-</i>

2069
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:12,057
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

2070
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:13,729
You may kiss the bride.

2071
01:38:14,055 --> 01:38:16,683
Mikey! Kiss her! Kiss her!

2072
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:24,615
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Mr. and Mrs. Michael Hanover.

2073
01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:30,451
- Go hug your mother, boy.
- Okay.

2074
01:38:43,709 --> 01:38:45,677
You did it, Michael.

2075
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:50,054
You did it and it is perfect.

2076
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:52,636
And I love you so much.

2077
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:20,088
<i>Okay, so it turns out, Vegas isn't
the worst place for couples after all.</i>

2078
01:39:20,163 --> 01:39:23,167
<i>You know, maybe I should come here
with Gail sometime,</i>

2079
01:39:23,249 --> 01:39:27,095
<i>when it's snowing,
or maybe when it's hailing</i>

2080
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:31,516
<i>or when it's freezing rain,
which means never!</i>

2081
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:33,685
Dropped your dollar.

2082
01:39:33,759 --> 01:39:35,432
Bennett, what the hell
am I gonna do with a dollar?

2083
01:39:35,511 --> 01:39:38,712
That's like putting a raindrop in the ocean.
Get your ass out of my face, please.

2084
01:39:38,764 --> 01:39:40,311
All right.

2085
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:47,944
<i>Survey says...</i>

2086
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:59,828
Yes! $100,000!

2087
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:01,379
That's my dollar, I won!

2088
01:40:01,454 --> 01:40:03,252
Yes. Thank you.

2089
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:06,631
Yes. Thank you, Steve Harvey. Thank you.

2090
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:08,302
That was my dollar, sir.
That was actually my dollar.

2091
01:40:08,377 --> 01:40:10,880
No, it's mine. You gave it to me.
I put it in the machine. It's my dollar.

2092
01:40:10,963 --> 01:40:12,135
I didn't give you shit!

2093
01:40:12,215 --> 01:40:14,388
You gave me the dollar. Remember
the whole "raindrop in the ocean"?

2094
01:40:14,467 --> 01:40:16,811
That is his money. We won it.

2095
01:40:16,886 --> 01:40:18,058
It's my dollar.

2096
01:40:18,137 --> 01:40:20,060
Bennett, you tell your wife to shut her face!

2097
01:40:20,139 --> 01:40:23,643
- Don't tell me to shut up.
- Don't bump, don't bump me.

2098
01:40:23,726 --> 01:40:29,324
Hello. Hi, there. Cedric! You owe me money.

2099
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:36,948
That's my dollar!

2100
01:45:13,307 --> 01:45:14,479
You leave yet?

2101
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:16,060
Not quite, sir.

2102
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:18,945
What about now?

2103
01:45:19,021 --> 01:45:20,022
Almost.

2104
01:45:23,025 --> 01:45:25,153
You there, Declan?

2105
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:26,909
Not really.
