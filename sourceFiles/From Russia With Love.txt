300MB UNITED TEAM - sunmenghao

1
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,052
Exactly 1 minute 52 seconds.
That's excellent.

2
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,992
Check.

3
00:06:19,203 --> 00:06:21,204
Knight takes bishop.

4
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:28,044
Knight... takes bishop.

5
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:15,588
King to rook two.

6
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:19,550
King... to rook two.

7
00:07:29,185 --> 00:07:32,187
Queen to king four.

8
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:36,482
Queen... to king four.

9
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:51,413
My congratulations, sir. A brilliant coup.

10
00:08:14,518 --> 00:08:18,479
Siamese fighting fish.
Fascinating creatures.

11
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:21,566
Brave, but on the whole stupid.

12
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,736
Yes, they're stupid.

13
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,904
Except for the occasional one...

14
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:30,992
...such as we have here.
He lets the other two fight...

15
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:34,411
...while he waits.

16
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:44,921
Waits until the survivor is so exhausted
that he cannot defend himself.

17
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:49,717
And then, like SPECTRE, he strikes.

18
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,761
I find the parallel amusing.

19
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:56,015
Our organisation did not arrange
for you to come over...

20
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:59,476
...from the Russians just for amusement,
Number Three.

21
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:04,814
Come in, Kronsteen.

22
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:09,986
Sit down, Number Three, while we listen
to what Number Five has devised for us.

23
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:15,283
I hope his efforts as director of planning
continue to be as successful as his chess.

24
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:17,034
They will be.

25
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:20,537
According to your instructions,
I've planned for SPECTRE...

26
00:09:20,705 --> 00:09:24,249
...to steal from the Russians
their new Lektor decoding machine.

27
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,668
We need the services
of a female member...

28
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:29,462
...of the Russian Cryptograph Section
in Turkey...

29
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:32,757
...and... the help of
the British Secret Service.

30
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:35,843
Neither the Russians
nor the British will be aware...

31
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:38,554
...that they are now working for us.

32
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,599
Number Three, is your section ready
to carry out Kronsteen's directives?

33
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:46,979
Yes, Number One. The operation will be
organised according to Kronsteen's plan.

34
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:50,816
I have selected a suitable girl
from the Russian Consulate in Istanbul.

35
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:52,984
She's capable, cooperative...

36
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,820
...and her loyalty to the state
is beyond question.

37
00:09:55,988 --> 00:09:58,614
You're sure she believes you're still...

38
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:01,409
...head of operations
for Soviet Intelligence?

39
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:04,954
It is most unlikely she would know
I'm now working for SPECTRE.

40
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:09,249
Moscow kept my defection secret from
all but a few members of the presidium.

41
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,459
For your sake, I hope so.

42
00:10:11,502 --> 00:10:13,253
Kronsteen, you're sure...

43
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:15,422
...this plan is foolproof?

44
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:21,594
Yes, it is. Because I have anticipated
every possible variation of countermove.

45
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:25,681
But what makes you think that M,
the head of British Intelligence...

46
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:28,767
...will oblige you
by falling in with your plan?

47
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:31,186
Because this is so obviously a trap.

48
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:36,191
My reading of the British mentality is that
they always treat a trap as a challenge.

49
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:40,028
And they couldn't possibly
pass up even the slightest chance...

50
00:10:40,154 --> 00:10:43,030
...of getting their hands
on the Lektor decoder.

51
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:45,283
They have wanted one for years.

52
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:48,578
All that you say could be true.
What else?

53
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,290
As an added refinement, I think
SPECTRE would have the chance...

54
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:56,627
...of a personal revenge
for the killing of our operative... Dr No.

55
00:10:56,752 --> 00:11:01,297
Because the man the British will almost
certainly use on a mission of this sort...

56
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:03,717
...would be their agent James Bond.

57
00:11:03,884 --> 00:11:08,930
Let his death be a particularly
unpleasant and humiliating one.

58
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:10,514
Good.

59
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:13,642
I shall put my plan
into operation straight away.

60
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:15,769
And there will be no failure.

61
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:59,476
Hurry!

62
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,236
Welcome to SPECTRE Island.
I hope you had a pleasant flight.

63
00:12:09,404 --> 00:12:12,072
My time is limited.
Is the man I requested ready?

64
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,199
- His dossier.
- Good.

65
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:20,371
Donald Grant, convicted murderer.

66
00:12:20,497 --> 00:12:25,543
Escaped Dartmoor Prison in 1960,
recruited in Tangier, 1962.

67
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:27,962
Excellent. Where is he now?

68
00:12:28,088 --> 00:12:31,966
- At the lake.
- Bring him to my office, will you?

69
00:12:32,925 --> 00:12:34,884
Take me to the lake.

70
00:12:34,969 --> 00:12:37,512
Through the training area.

71
00:12:37,638 --> 00:12:40,473
This Grant's one of the best men
we've ever had.

72
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:44,727
A homicidal paranoiac. Superb material,
though his methods were a little crude.

73
00:12:44,812 --> 00:12:48,940
His response to our training
and indoctrination have been remarkable.

74
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,624
I hope our work here
meets with your approval.

75
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,461
Training is useful.
But there is no substitute for experience.

76
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:14,713
I agree. We use live targets as well.

77
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:30,645
- Call him!
- Grant!

78
00:13:55,293 --> 00:14:00,172
He seems fit enough. Have him
report to me in Istanbul in 24 hours.

79
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:23,291
Corporal of State Security
Tatiana Romanova.

80
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,168
Come in.

81
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,802
You know who I am?

82
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:38,722
Colonel Klebb,
head of operations for... for SMERSH.

83
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:42,684
I saw you once in Moscow, when
I worked for the English decoding room.

84
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,395
Did you tell the consulate
you were coming here?

85
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,563
- No, the message...
- Yes, I know.

86
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:49,357
I sent it.

87
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:55,321
Your work record is excellent.

88
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:58,699
- The state is proud of you.
- Thank you, Comrade Colonel.

89
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:00,868
Take off your jacket.

90
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:06,414
Turn around.

91
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,751
You're a fine-looking girl.

92
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,837
Sit down.

93
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:18,884
I see you trained for the ballet.

94
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:22,512
But I grew an inch
over the regulation height and so...

95
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,681
And then you have had three lovers.

96
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:27,726
What is the purpose
of such an intimate question?

97
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:30,312
You're not here to ask questions!

98
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:32,856
You forget to whom you are speaking!

99
00:16:34,274 --> 00:16:37,693
- I was in love.
- And if you were not in love?

100
00:16:40,822 --> 00:16:44,158
I suppose that would depend...
on the man.

101
00:16:44,284 --> 00:16:45,576
Sensible answer.

102
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:48,412
This man, for instance.

103
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:53,750
I cannot tell.
Perhaps if he was kind and kulturny.

104
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:58,713
Corporal, I have selected you
for a most important assignment.

105
00:16:58,797 --> 00:17:01,966
Its purpose is to give
false information to the enemy.

106
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:05,094
If you complete it successfully,
you will be promoted.

107
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:08,597
From now on,
you will do anything he says.

108
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:10,349
And if I refuse?

109
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:13,769
Then you will not leave this room alive.

110
00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:19,066
I will obey your orders.

111
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:21,401
Good. Now, these are your instructions.

112
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:23,027
You report to me here...

113
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:26,822
...but the consulate security man
must not know that I'm in Istanbul.

114
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:30,659
- This is classified far above his level.
- I will say nothing to anyone.

115
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:32,870
If you do, you will be shot!

116
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:37,333
Come, come, my dear.

117
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:43,087
You're very fortunate to have been chosen
for such a simple, delightful duty.

118
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:47,091
A real labour of love...

119
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:50,219
...as we say.

120
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:00,353
- Great sport, this!
- What did you say?

121
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:03,440
I said it's great sport, this punting.

122
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:06,318
I couldn't agree with him more.

123
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,862
I may even give up golf for it.

124
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,696
Really?

125
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:13,991
Not quite.

126
00:18:15,535 --> 00:18:19,246
Souvenir from another jealous woman?

127
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:22,833
Yes. But I haven't turned
my back on one since.

128
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:30,214
- Excuse me.
- What?

129
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:37,388
- Give me my shirt, will you?
- What's going on?

130
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:40,808
- I have to make a phone call.
- But we haven't eaten yet.

131
00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:43,560
I'm starving.

132
00:18:45,605 --> 00:18:48,315
Come in, Univex. James Bond here. Over.

133
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:52,861
He's been asking for you all morning.
Where in the world are you, James?

134
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,990
Well, I've just been reviewing an old case.

135
00:18:57,115 --> 00:19:00,618
- Oh, so I'm an old case now, am I?
- Ssh! It's the office.

136
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:03,996
- Tell him I'm on my way, will you?
- He is not on his way.

137
00:19:04,122 --> 00:19:07,624
Sylvia, behave! We'll do this again
some other time soon.

138
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:11,128
Do what? Last time you said that,
you went off to Jamaica.

139
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:14,006
I haven't seen you for six months!

140
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:18,009
- I'll be there in an hour.
- I'll tell him.

141
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:22,263
Hey, your old case
sounds interesting, James.

142
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,100
Make that an hour and a half.

143
00:19:30,354 --> 00:19:33,023
Now, about that lunch.

144
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:42,282
For my next miracle, I...

145
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:59,798
It'll be a miracle if he can explain
where he's been all day.

146
00:19:59,924 --> 00:20:02,968
But I've never even heard
of a Tatiana Romanova.

147
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,845
- Ridiculous, isn't it?
- It's absolutely crazy.

148
00:20:06,013 --> 00:20:09,432
Of course, girls do fall in love
with pictures of film stars.

149
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:14,770
But not a Russian cipher clerk
with a file photo of a British agent!

150
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:17,690
Unless she's mental.

151
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:19,941
No, it's some sort of trap.

152
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:24,863
Well, obviously. And the bait
is a cipher machine. A brand new Lektor.

153
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:27,365
A Lektor, no less.

154
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:29,701
The CIA's been after one for years.

155
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:31,119
Yes, so have we.

156
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:35,748
When she contacted Kerim Bey,
head of Station T, Turkey...

157
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:40,377
...and told him she wanted to defect,
she said she'd turn it over to us.

158
00:20:40,545 --> 00:20:42,421
On one condition.

159
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:47,593
That you went out to Istanbul and brought
her and the machine back to England.

160
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:51,263
Here's a snapshot
Kerim managed to get of her.

161
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:54,473
Well, I don't know too much
about cryptography, sir...

162
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:58,311
...but, a Lektor could decode
their top secret signals.

163
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:01,647
The whole thing's so fantastic
it just could be... true.

164
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:03,858
That had occurred to me.

165
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:08,946
Besides, the Russians haven't
been up to any tricks recently.

166
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:11,865
Well, really, I'm not
too busy at the moment, sir.

167
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:15,368
You're booked on the 8:30 plane
in the morning.

168
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:18,746
If there's any chance of getting a Lektor,
we must look into it.

169
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,626
Suppose when she meets me in the flesh
I don't come up to expectations?

170
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:26,628
Just see that you do.

171
00:21:27,297 --> 00:21:31,341
Miss Moneypenny, ask
the equipment officer to come in, please.

172
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:34,845
Q Branch has put together
a smart-looking piece of luggage.

173
00:21:34,971 --> 00:21:38,223
We're issuing this
to all double-0 personnel.

174
00:21:39,975 --> 00:21:42,268
An ordinary black leather case...

175
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:45,521
...with 20 rounds of ammunition,
here and here.

176
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:52,987
If you take the top off,
you'll find the ammunition inside.

177
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,240
In the side here, flat throwing knife.

178
00:21:57,366 --> 00:22:00,159
Press that button there,
and out she comes.

179
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:07,375
Inside the case,
you'll find an AR7 folding sniper's rifle.

180
00:22:07,418 --> 00:22:11,587
.25 calibre,
with an infrared telescopic sight.

181
00:22:14,757 --> 00:22:18,301
If you pull out these straps,
inside are 50 gold sovereigns.

182
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:20,512
25 in either side.

183
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:23,223
Now, watch very carefully.

184
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:25,600
An ordinary tin of talcum powder.

185
00:22:25,726 --> 00:22:27,769
Inside, a tear-gas cartridge.

186
00:22:27,936 --> 00:22:31,939
That goes in the case
against the side here, like that.

187
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:34,066
It's magnetised, so it won't fall.

188
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:36,068
Shut the case.

189
00:22:36,194 --> 00:22:38,320
Normally, to open a case like that...

190
00:22:38,446 --> 00:22:40,781
...you move the catches to the side.

191
00:22:40,949 --> 00:22:44,535
If you do, the cartridge will explode...
in your face.

192
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:47,120
To stop the cartridge exploding...

193
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:50,665
...turn the catches horizontally.

194
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:54,669
Like that. Then... open normally.

195
00:22:55,462 --> 00:22:57,004
Now you try it.

196
00:22:59,424 --> 00:23:04,136
- Turn the catches... like that.
- That's right.

197
00:23:04,262 --> 00:23:06,304
And open ordinarily.

198
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:09,850
- You got it?
- Yes, I think so.

199
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:13,144
- Is that all, sir?
- Yes, thanks very much.

200
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:15,730
That's a nasty little Christmas present.

201
00:23:15,855 --> 00:23:18,649
But I shouldn't think
I'll need it on this assignment.

202
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:22,069
All the same, take it with you.
Good luck, 007.

203
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:24,238
Thank you, sir.

204
00:23:27,117 --> 00:23:30,744
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends.

205
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:35,498
And one plane ticket. Lucky man.
I've never been to Istanbul.

206
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:38,084
- You've never been to Istanbul?
- No.

207
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:41,337
Where the moonlight on the Bosphorus
is irresistible?

208
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:45,424
Maybe I should get you
to take me there someday.

209
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,677
I've tried everything else.

210
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:51,638
Darling Moneypenny, you know
I never even look at another woman.

211
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,723
Oh, really, James?

212
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,477
Let me tell you
the secret of the world.

213
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,608
Miss Moneypenny,
ask 007 to leave the photograph.

214
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,277
I'm sure he'll recognise the lady
when he sees her.

215
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:23,960
Good luck.

216
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:42,310
Hello, London.
Your flight PA1 just landed Istanbul.

217
00:24:45,147 --> 00:24:47,107
Mr. Bond?

218
00:24:47,316 --> 00:24:50,777
- Kerim Bey sent a car for you, sir.
- Fine.

219
00:24:50,945 --> 00:24:53,780
- Can I borrow a match?
- I use a lighter.

220
00:24:53,947 --> 00:24:56,490
- It's better still.
- Until they go wrong.

221
00:24:56,658 --> 00:24:59,743
- Exactly.
- I'll get the car, sir.

222
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:39,280
Kerim Bey suggested you see him
before going to the hotel.

223
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:42,659
- Would that be convenient?
- Fine.

224
00:25:56,254 --> 00:26:00,091
I suppose it's customary
to have people tailing you in these parts.

225
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:04,512
Oh, yes, sir.
Today it's Citroen H 31854 on duty.

226
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,181
They're Bulgarians
working for the Russians.

227
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:10,851
They follow us, we follow them.
It's a sort of understanding we have.

228
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:12,895
That's very friendly.

229
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:15,411
My friend! Come in, come in!

230
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:18,331
Glad to see you. Welcome to Istanbul.

231
00:27:18,456 --> 00:27:22,626
Well, thank you for sending the car.
But it does rather tie you in with me.

232
00:27:22,668 --> 00:27:24,669
You're in the Balkans now, Mr. Bond.

233
00:27:24,837 --> 00:27:27,714
The game with the Russians
is played differently here.

234
00:27:27,924 --> 00:27:31,760
For day-to-day routine matters, we make
it easy to keep a tab on each other.

235
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,304
So I gathered from your chauffeur.

236
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:36,430
He's a rather intelligent young man.

237
00:27:36,556 --> 00:27:38,766
He should be. He's my son.

238
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,061
- Coffee?
- Medium sweet.

239
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,896
Two medium sweet.

240
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:46,565
He also is my son.

241
00:27:47,525 --> 00:27:51,904
All of my key employees are my sons.
Blood is the best security in this business.

242
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:53,946
You must have quite an establishment.

243
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:56,115
Biggest family payroll in Turkey.

244
00:27:56,158 --> 00:27:58,201
Not bad for a man who started life

245
00:27:58,327 --> 00:28:01,162
breaking chains and bending bars
in a circus.

246
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,956
But let's talk about this business of yours.

247
00:28:04,124 --> 00:28:06,209
Well, M thinks I'm wasting my time here.

248
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,711
And so do I.
This is an old friend of mine.

249
00:28:09,837 --> 00:28:13,506
- And it tells me something smells.
- Maybe.

250
00:28:13,674 --> 00:28:16,468
But if there's a chance
of getting a Lektor...

251
00:28:16,636 --> 00:28:19,137
Now you tell me,
where can I contact this girl?

252
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:22,641
She said she would make her own
arrangements. You'll have to wait.

253
00:28:26,728 --> 00:28:28,145
Thank you.

254
00:28:28,313 --> 00:28:30,981
My friend, if you really want my advice...

255
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:36,153
...you should spend a few pleasant days
with us here in Istanbul, and then...

256
00:28:36,321 --> 00:28:37,905
...then go home.

257
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:10,518
- James Bond, I have a reservation.
- Mr. Bond, your room is ready.

258
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:12,770
Number 32.

259
00:29:14,606 --> 00:29:16,982
- 32 for Mr. Bond.
- Hope you enjoy your stay.

260
00:29:17,192 --> 00:29:18,942
Thank you.

261
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:44,175
- Will there be anything else, sir?
- Only this.

262
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:47,177
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

263
00:31:02,497 --> 00:31:03,998
- Mr. Bond here.
- Yes?

264
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:06,208
- The room won't do.
- I'm sorry.

265
00:31:06,293 --> 00:31:07,752
The bed's too small.

266
00:31:07,878 --> 00:31:09,003
One moment, sir.

267
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:10,546
Did you hear that?

268
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:14,300
Tell him that's all there is.
Unless he would like the bridal suite.

269
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:18,762
I'm sorry, sir. That's all we have available.
Except the bridal suite.

270
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:21,514
Well, let's have a look at it. I may like it.

271
00:31:24,268 --> 00:31:27,520
The porter will show it to you.
He will be up immediately.

272
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:29,564
Good.

273
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:09,810
Good work. Who can the Russians
suspect but the British?

274
00:32:09,935 --> 00:32:14,439
The Cold War in Istanbul
will not remain cold very much longer.

275
00:32:36,127 --> 00:32:38,962
Ali Kerim Bey.

276
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:50,848
Ali Kerim Bey.

277
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,769
Ali Kerim Bey...

278
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,828
You are not glad to see me
this morning, chéri?

279
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:15,912
Overjoyed.

280
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:21,167
I...

281
00:33:21,377 --> 00:33:23,378
I no longer please you?

282
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,715
Be still!

283
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:33,929
Back to the salt mines.

284
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,455
Careful with those papers.

285
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,832
Well, who won?

286
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,834
I had visitors.

287
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:08,628
Limpet mine on the wall outside.

288
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,839
Timed to catch me at my desk.

289
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:14,843
But, by good fortune, I was relaxing
on the settee for a few moments.

290
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:19,055
- The girl left in hysterics.
- Found your technique too violent?

291
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:22,307
I cannot understand
this sudden breach of the truce.

292
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:25,477
It's unlike the Russians
to break the peace this way.

293
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:29,398
Most inconsiderate. I think my visit
might have something to do with it.

294
00:34:29,524 --> 00:34:31,608
Let's try and find out.

295
00:34:39,658 --> 00:34:41,909
Close up afterwards.

296
00:34:45,872 --> 00:34:47,915
Quite a place you've got here.

297
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:51,752
The Emperor Constantine built it
as a reservoir... 1,600 years ago.

298
00:34:51,961 --> 00:34:53,378
Really?

299
00:34:54,296 --> 00:34:56,214
Here.

300
00:35:25,033 --> 00:35:27,076
My daily exercise.

301
00:35:27,202 --> 00:35:30,079
At eleven in the morning
and three in the afternoon.

302
00:35:31,081 --> 00:35:33,374
Tie her up, will you?

303
00:35:42,424 --> 00:35:44,634
Mind your head now.

304
00:35:52,476 --> 00:35:54,644
Underneath the Russian Consulate.

305
00:35:56,396 --> 00:35:58,438
A present from your navy.

306
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:05,904
Our friends were evicted while the Public
Works Ministry conducted a survey.

307
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,157
The story was that
the traffic shook the foundations.

308
00:36:09,241 --> 00:36:12,660
By the time the place was declared safe,
I had this installed.

309
00:36:12,744 --> 00:36:15,496
I can see everything
M said about you is right.

310
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,123
Know why I stay in this mad business?

311
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:21,001
It could be that you find
selling rugs a bore.

312
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:24,296
My friend, you should be a mind-reader.

313
00:36:24,422 --> 00:36:28,592
Head of the table is General Vassili.
Director of Military Intelligence.

314
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:33,221
On his left, Koslovski. Chief of Security.

315
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:36,182
Opposite him, Benz. One of his agents.

316
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,436
I can't see the face of the other man.

317
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:43,606
The one the general is shouting at.

318
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,403
He's giving him a hell of a blowing up.

319
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:53,323
It's too bad
we can't hear as well as see.

320
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:57,410
Tell me, does our girl Romanova
ever come to this room?

321
00:36:57,536 --> 00:36:59,370
Sometimes, with messages.

322
00:37:00,205 --> 00:37:02,748
I can see the face of the other man now.

323
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:05,751
Krilencu!

324
00:37:05,877 --> 00:37:07,920
So he's back.

325
00:37:08,088 --> 00:37:11,131
Another Bulgarian they use as a killer.

326
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:14,718
Just the man for the limpet mine job.

327
00:37:16,178 --> 00:37:18,262
I've had trouble with him before.

328
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:22,225
But he's stayed out of Istanbul
for over a year now.

329
00:37:22,726 --> 00:37:25,520
Take a look. You should remember him.

330
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:28,523
This man kills for pleasure.

331
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:32,234
Nice face.

332
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:35,278
Just a moment. A girl's just come in.

333
00:37:35,404 --> 00:37:38,406
Probably Romanova.
She's the only one who's allowed to.

334
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:40,075
How does she look to you?

335
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,665
Well, from this angle...

336
00:37:46,748 --> 00:37:49,249
...things are shaping up nicely.

337
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:57,424
I'd like to see her in the flesh.

338
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:58,884
Yes.

339
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:02,930
- Could you get me a plan of that place?
- I wish I could.

340
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:06,015
The original drawing
must be registered somewhere.

341
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:07,975
I'll get onto that.

342
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:14,315
Now, I need a little time
to deal with this stinking Krilencu.

343
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:18,319
It will be better if you didn't stay
at the hotel tonight. Come!

344
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,871
I see now why you keep the Rolls.

345
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:33,708
One of my sons is driving it.
With two dummies in the back.

346
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:37,628
In the opposite direction.
They'll follow it for hours.

347
00:38:38,588 --> 00:38:40,631
You'll like my Gypsy friends.

348
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:43,383
I use them like
the Russians use the Bulgars.

349
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,761
It's created a blood feud between them.

350
00:39:06,197 --> 00:39:07,364
Hello, Krilencu?

351
00:39:25,298 --> 00:39:26,924
We've come on the wrong night.

352
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:29,843
Two girls who love the same man
want to kill each other.

353
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:31,762
It must be settled the Gypsy way.

354
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,598
As I'm a family friend,
we'll be allowed to stay.

355
00:39:37,268 --> 00:39:40,645
We're bidden to table.
I hope you can eat with your fingers.

356
00:39:40,771 --> 00:39:41,771
Kerim Bey!

357
00:39:49,696 --> 00:39:52,364
Raki! Filthy stuff!

358
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:10,896
Quick!

359
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:17,416
Tell our host
his hospitality overwhelms me.

360
00:42:21,086 --> 00:42:23,713
Thank you, thank you!

361
00:42:42,565 --> 00:42:45,942
No matter what happens now,
say and do nothing.

362
00:42:49,822 --> 00:42:54,200
He's asking whether they will cease
their blood feud and give up this fight.

363
00:42:54,492 --> 00:42:57,786
The tribe elders will decide
who will marry the chief's son.

364
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:06,295
- She's saying...
- Yes, I think I got it without the subtitles!

365
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:54,033
Thank you!

366
00:46:36,741 --> 00:46:39,660
- Did you get Krilencu?
- No.

367
00:46:40,536 --> 00:46:42,620
Just a minute. Here! Thank you.

368
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:46,541
You fought well.
I am nothing but a clumsy old man.

369
00:46:48,043 --> 00:46:50,962
They're making one
of the wounded Bulgars talk.

370
00:46:54,215 --> 00:46:56,258
It was me they were after.

371
00:46:56,342 --> 00:46:58,843
Why would they want me out of the way?

372
00:46:59,971 --> 00:47:03,223
Tomorrow we will have to find
Krilencu's hide-out.

373
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:06,142
Meantime, I'll take care of this filthy stuff.

374
00:47:12,732 --> 00:47:17,027
Vavra thanks you for saving his life.
You are now his son.

375
00:47:18,154 --> 00:47:22,699
Thank you. I'd like to ask him a favour.
Could he stop the girl fight?

376
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,918
He says your heart is too soft
to be a real Gypsy.

377
00:47:34,002 --> 00:47:36,128
But he lets you decide the matter.

378
00:47:38,006 --> 00:47:40,049
As if I didn't have enough problems.

379
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:55,980
Vavra said for you to decide.

380
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:59,692
So decide! They're both yours!

381
00:48:05,198 --> 00:48:07,324
This might take some time.

382
00:48:40,606 --> 00:48:43,066
Did you pick up that package at the hotel?

383
00:48:43,234 --> 00:48:45,276
It's on the seat.

384
00:48:45,736 --> 00:48:47,362
Thank you.

385
00:49:02,168 --> 00:49:04,336
Twice that Krilencu has tried to kill me.

386
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,131
The third time he will succeed.
Unless I get him first.

387
00:49:09,257 --> 00:49:12,927
- And that I'll do tonight.
- Not with that arm you won't.

388
00:49:12,969 --> 00:49:15,221
You'd better leave it to me.

389
00:49:15,347 --> 00:49:17,681
I'm already too much in your debt.

390
00:49:17,808 --> 00:49:20,226
How can a friend be in debt?

391
00:49:28,943 --> 00:49:30,693
Here.

392
00:49:34,949 --> 00:49:36,282
Infrared lens.

393
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,399
My sons.

394
00:50:13,484 --> 00:50:17,278
They will ring his doorbell.
He has a private escape hatch.

395
00:50:22,201 --> 00:50:24,452
Try this for size.

396
00:50:27,497 --> 00:50:30,415
- Do you notice anything?
- Not yet.

397
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:33,335
She has a lovely mouth, that Anita.

398
00:50:33,461 --> 00:50:35,337
Yes. I see what you mean.

399
00:50:37,882 --> 00:50:41,343
Arm or no arm, I have to pull that trigger.

400
00:50:42,636 --> 00:50:44,803
If you think you can.

401
00:50:44,846 --> 00:50:46,931
You've got one shot, remember.

402
00:50:47,057 --> 00:50:49,099
It'll have to do.

403
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,694
Quick, he's coming.

404
00:51:11,996 --> 00:51:12,996
Quick!

405
00:51:24,675 --> 00:51:27,093
That pays many debts.

406
00:51:27,845 --> 00:51:30,013
She should have kept her mouth shut.

407
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:05,587
Hello?

408
00:52:05,713 --> 00:52:08,840
Breakfast for one at nine please.

409
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:13,595
Green figs, yogurt, coffee, very black.

410
00:52:13,721 --> 00:52:15,138
Thank you.

411
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:31,375
You look surprised.

412
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:34,378
I thought you were expecting me.

413
00:53:34,504 --> 00:53:37,715
So you are Tatiana Romanova?

414
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,508
My friends call me Tania.

415
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:42,635
Mine call me James Bond.

416
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,558
Well, now that we've been
properly introduced...

417
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,394
Careful! Guns upset me.

418
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:56,441
I'm sorry. I'm a bit upset myself.

419
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:00,777
You look just like your... your photograph.

420
00:54:00,945 --> 00:54:03,405
You're one of the most
beautiful girls I've seen.

421
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:06,783
Thank you, but I think
my mouth is too big.

422
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,119
No, it's the right size.

423
00:54:11,246 --> 00:54:13,080
For me, that is.

424
00:54:16,585 --> 00:54:18,294
Yes.

425
00:54:18,336 --> 00:54:20,045
Is it here?

426
00:54:20,088 --> 00:54:22,423
What?

427
00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:25,509
The decoding machine, Lektor.

428
00:54:26,552 --> 00:54:28,136
Must we talk about it now?

429
00:54:31,223 --> 00:54:33,391
Or is it at the Russian Consulate?

430
00:54:36,645 --> 00:54:38,104
Yes.

431
00:54:39,815 --> 00:54:43,526
Yes... I would need a plan of the place.

432
00:54:43,651 --> 00:54:46,987
If you could get one, we could meet
at the Saint Sophia mosque.

433
00:54:47,196 --> 00:54:50,824
- Like we were tourists.
- Why don't you ask me that

434
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:53,118
Later?

435
00:54:55,204 --> 00:54:57,289
Now what are you looking for?

436
00:54:57,456 --> 00:55:00,542
The scar.
You see, I know all about you...

437
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:02,376
...from your file.

438
00:55:02,544 --> 00:55:07,047
You do? Well, I hope
you're not... disappointed.

439
00:55:08,383 --> 00:55:10,467
I will tell you...

440
00:55:13,054 --> 00:55:15,139
...in the morning.

441
00:56:02,724 --> 00:56:06,811
We are now approaching the most
interesting corner of Saint Sophia.

442
00:56:06,895 --> 00:56:09,355
Including these two great...

443
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:13,734
...red porphyry columns,
stolen and brought from Egypt.

444
00:56:13,902 --> 00:56:15,695
In front of them...

445
00:56:15,863 --> 00:56:20,366
...alabaster urn
was brought from Bergama...

446
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:24,744
...a famous historical city near Smyrna.

447
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:29,708
Dates back
from the Alexander the Great period.

448
00:56:29,834 --> 00:56:35,004
About 1648, Sultan Murad IV...

449
00:56:35,088 --> 00:56:38,298
...brought it from Bergama.

450
00:56:38,466 --> 00:56:42,261
It was used as an ablution fountain.

451
00:56:42,387 --> 00:56:47,391
It contains a thousand litres of water.

452
00:56:47,517 --> 00:56:50,978
Right after the ablution fountain...

453
00:56:51,103 --> 00:56:56,857
...we are going to a highly
interesting column over there...

454
00:56:56,984 --> 00:57:02,154
...known for centuries
as the Saint Sophia...

455
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:04,198
...wishing column.

456
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:06,117
Tens of thousands...

457
00:57:06,243 --> 00:57:08,536
...of people have wished here...

458
00:57:08,703 --> 00:57:12,872
...putting their right hand...

459
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:18,628
...and middle finger in the hole...

460
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,990
I promise you,
it wasn't one of my men who killed him.

461
00:58:35,075 --> 00:58:37,243
He didn't die of old age.

462
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,079
All I know is that it saved me the job.

463
00:58:40,163 --> 00:58:43,958
Once he'd seen the girl, she was
obviously compromised, and so...

464
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:46,584
And he wasn't killed because of that.

465
00:58:47,753 --> 00:58:51,256
Let's just say that Istanbul's a rough town.

466
00:58:51,382 --> 00:58:55,885
Let's see how Tania's map
compares with your architect's plans.

467
00:58:55,928 --> 00:58:58,888
This is the conference room
of the Russian Consulate.

468
00:58:58,973 --> 00:59:00,932
Yes, that checks.

469
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:04,643
And this here is the communication room.
That's the same.

470
00:59:04,769 --> 00:59:08,146
She says she works there with the Lektor
between two and three.

471
00:59:08,272 --> 00:59:10,357
How is she gonna get the machine to us?

472
00:59:10,358 --> 00:59:13,652
She's leaving that to me.
She'll do anything I say.

473
00:59:13,778 --> 00:59:16,488
Anything! My dear James...

474
00:59:16,613 --> 00:59:18,572
You're not using this.

475
00:59:18,657 --> 00:59:22,826
It all sounds too easy. We don't
even know if she's telling the truth.

476
00:59:22,911 --> 00:59:27,039
- Well, I intend to find out.
- Where? In the hotel?

477
00:59:27,123 --> 00:59:30,042
She won't go there again.
Says it's too dangerous.

478
00:59:30,168 --> 00:59:34,546
The old game.
Give a wolf a taste, then keep him hungry.

479
00:59:34,713 --> 00:59:37,465
My friend, she's got you dangling.

480
00:59:37,549 --> 00:59:40,218
That doesn't matter.

481
00:59:40,302 --> 00:59:43,554
- All I want is that Lektor.
- All?

482
00:59:43,597 --> 00:59:45,848
Are you sure that's all you want?

483
00:59:46,767 --> 00:59:48,434
Well...

484
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:34,852
Lovely view.

485
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:38,105
James, we must leave here now.

486
01:00:38,189 --> 01:00:40,440
If that agent reports my meeting you...

487
01:00:40,608 --> 01:00:43,944
- Don't worry. He won't.
- But you don't understand the danger!

488
01:00:45,947 --> 01:00:47,864
James, look up!

489
01:00:47,949 --> 01:00:50,116
Smile.

490
01:00:53,036 --> 01:00:55,537
Another one. Further back.

491
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:04,088
About the machine...

492
01:01:04,172 --> 01:01:07,424
That's all you are interested in. Not me.

493
01:01:07,592 --> 01:01:09,384
Business first.

494
01:01:09,551 --> 01:01:11,969
I know, once you have got
what you want...

495
01:01:12,095 --> 01:01:15,598
I haven't got it yet.
But if you tell me about the machine...

496
01:01:15,724 --> 01:01:18,684
...we won't always be
working on the company's time.

497
01:01:19,394 --> 01:01:23,064
All right. What do you want to know?

498
01:01:25,483 --> 01:01:26,650
Talk into this.

499
01:01:26,776 --> 01:01:30,362
Answer my questions quietly, but clearly.

500
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,699
How large is the machine?

501
01:01:35,868 --> 01:01:39,162
Like... like a typewriter.

502
01:01:39,288 --> 01:01:41,080
Weight?

503
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:45,209
About ten kilos. Ina brown case.

504
01:01:45,293 --> 01:01:46,793
Brown like your eyes.

505
01:01:46,961 --> 01:01:48,295
Keep it technical.

506
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:51,173
Self-calibrating or manual?

507
01:01:53,468 --> 01:01:57,179
Both, with an in-built compensator.
James...

508
01:01:57,304 --> 01:01:59,472
- Couldn't we...
- Not now.

509
01:02:00,891 --> 01:02:02,558
Talk into the camera.

510
01:02:02,726 --> 01:02:06,020
- How many keys?
- Symbol or code keys?

511
01:02:06,063 --> 01:02:07,396
Both.

512
01:02:07,522 --> 01:02:10,858
There are 24 symbols, 16 code keys.

513
01:02:10,984 --> 01:02:14,987
It is inserted in a slot and the message
comes out in a paper roll...

514
01:02:15,112 --> 01:02:18,740
...from another slot on the other side.
The mechanism is...

515
01:02:18,824 --> 01:02:22,827
Oh, James, James, will you make love
to me all the time in England?

516
01:02:22,953 --> 01:02:25,747
Day and night.
Go on about the mechanism.

517
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:27,999
Oh, yes, the mechanism.

518
01:02:28,125 --> 01:02:31,878
Once, when it was being repaired,
I saw the insides.

519
01:02:32,003 --> 01:02:35,631
There were many perforated discs,
made, I think, of copper...

520
01:02:35,798 --> 01:02:37,758
...with a small light...

521
01:02:38,009 --> 01:02:40,052
Dushka, tell me the truth.

522
01:02:40,178 --> 01:02:42,512
Am I as exciting
as all those Western girls?

523
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:46,767
Once, when I was with M in Tokyo,
we had an interesting experience.

524
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:48,726
Thank you, Miss Moneypenny.

525
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:56,942
Later, later.

526
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:59,445
Those copper discs and the light...

527
01:02:59,571 --> 01:03:03,532
Oh, the light, the light.
James, come closer.

528
01:03:03,657 --> 01:03:05,575
I want to whisper something.

529
01:03:05,659 --> 01:03:07,911
Go on.
No, not that, the mechanism!

530
01:03:07,995 --> 01:03:10,955
Miss Moneypenny,
as you're no doubt listening...

531
01:03:10,998 --> 01:03:14,000
...perhaps you'd take this cable?
Text reads:

532
01:03:14,084 --> 01:03:19,756
"Merchandise appears genuine, stop.
Go ahead with deal. Signed, M."

533
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:23,633
Now all I have to do
is to tell the girl the date.

534
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:28,263
- The 13th?
- The 14th.

535
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,321
Visas?

536
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:47,323
Visas?

537
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:50,075
- Tam.
- Thank you.

538
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,543
Visa, please.

539
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:03,629
Your clock, is it correct?

540
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:06,549
- Always.
- Of course.

541
01:04:08,092 --> 01:04:10,844
Gregori!

542
01:04:23,064 --> 01:04:25,983
Excuse me!
You did say your clock was correct?

543
01:04:26,151 --> 01:04:27,860
Russian clocks are always...

544
01:05:01,309 --> 01:05:03,393
- Is this the Lektor?
- Yes.

545
01:05:04,895 --> 01:05:06,479
Take this. It's only tear gas.

546
01:05:06,606 --> 01:05:09,441
I thought it was for tomorrow,
but today is the 13th.

547
01:05:09,525 --> 01:05:12,610
This is a hell of a time to be superstitious.
Come on.

548
01:05:20,994 --> 01:05:23,036
Come on, quickly.

549
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:43,598
Keep your head down.

550
01:05:49,562 --> 01:05:51,062
Back inside.

551
01:05:55,067 --> 01:05:57,277
This way, quickly!

552
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,488
Quickly, quickly!

553
01:06:54,747 --> 01:06:57,916
- What's the matter?
- Benz. The Russian security man.

554
01:07:00,336 --> 01:07:02,671
Come on, never mind.

555
01:07:02,797 --> 01:07:04,339
Hurry!

556
01:07:05,215 --> 01:07:06,924
Hurry!

557
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:31,072
Here's one of them.
And there's the other one.

558
01:07:42,917 --> 01:07:47,003
Your passports.
The pictures do not do you justice.

559
01:07:47,088 --> 01:07:49,631
I have rarely seen a handsomer couple.

560
01:07:49,757 --> 01:07:51,842
Mr. and Mrs. David Somerset.

561
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:54,009
Your name's Caroline.

562
01:07:54,219 --> 01:07:56,512
Caroline! I like that name.

563
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,849
We've been on a business trip.
On the way back to Derbyshire.

564
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:02,101
- To our children?
- No children.

565
01:08:02,227 --> 01:08:04,979
- Not even one little boy?
- Nyet.

566
01:08:05,105 --> 01:08:07,356
I like big families.

567
01:08:07,524 --> 01:08:10,609
My whole life has been
a crusade for larger families.

568
01:08:10,734 --> 01:08:12,026
So I heard.

569
01:08:12,111 --> 01:08:13,444
- Tania!
- Yes?

570
01:08:13,612 --> 01:08:15,780
Lock the door. I'll knock three times.

571
01:08:18,575 --> 01:08:21,411
- I'll go see the conductor.
- Will he cooperate?

572
01:08:21,537 --> 01:08:23,579
We've done business before.

573
01:08:23,747 --> 01:08:27,959
He'll stop the train near the frontier,
where my sons will be waiting with a car.

574
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:30,293
We'll be there... about six o'clock.

575
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:33,505
- And the airstrip?
- 20 miles.

576
01:08:42,597 --> 01:08:45,975
The plane is chartered to Athens.
You'll be in London tomorrow.

577
01:08:46,101 --> 01:08:48,143
We'll drink to that in London.

578
01:08:54,776 --> 01:08:57,903
We are really on our way to England.

579
01:08:57,945 --> 01:09:00,780
Yes. With a lovely
two-day honeymoon before us.

580
01:09:00,906 --> 01:09:03,032
Honeymoon? And I've nothing to wear!

581
01:09:05,244 --> 01:09:07,495
- Your trousseau.
- Oh, James!

582
01:09:07,663 --> 01:09:09,747
One moment.

583
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:21,091
Oh, no!

584
01:09:21,259 --> 01:09:23,385
James! James!

585
01:09:23,511 --> 01:09:26,763
Oh, look! Look!

586
01:09:37,982 --> 01:09:38,982
There!

587
01:09:45,823 --> 01:09:50,159
I will wear this one... in Piccadilly.

588
01:09:50,327 --> 01:09:54,455
You won't.
They've just passed some new laws there.

589
01:10:09,845 --> 01:10:13,598
- You're nearest.
- Oh, all right.

590
01:10:18,436 --> 01:10:19,603
Charming!

591
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,314
Charming!

592
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,234
Let's go to the restaurant car
for... that drink.

593
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,236
Surely.

594
01:10:27,362 --> 01:10:29,279
Charming!

595
01:10:30,323 --> 01:10:32,866
We'll continue the fashion show later.

596
01:10:35,619 --> 01:10:37,912
It's all arranged for me to stop the train.

597
01:10:38,038 --> 01:10:40,623
We'll get off at the restaurant car.
At that end.

598
01:10:40,749 --> 01:10:42,792
Fine. We'll meet you there at six.

599
01:10:42,918 --> 01:10:46,170
Make it a little later.
There are slight complications.

600
01:10:46,254 --> 01:10:51,092
One of the Russian security men - Benz.
He watches the stations. He's on the train.

601
01:10:51,217 --> 01:10:53,718
But he couldn't have contacted
the consulate.

602
01:10:53,803 --> 01:10:57,347
Just in case, I'll keep him company
until it's time to get off.

603
01:10:57,473 --> 01:10:59,724
Perhaps you'd like me to introduce you.

604
01:10:59,725 --> 01:11:01,643
Charming.

605
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:09,024
Ticket control.

606
01:11:26,541 --> 01:11:30,753
Do not be alarmed, my friend. We will
make you as comfortable as possible.

607
01:11:31,922 --> 01:11:36,634
Now I'm sure Commissar Benz
will have a much safer journey.

608
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,512
I'm not mad about his tailor, are you?

609
01:11:39,887 --> 01:11:43,389
James, life in Istanbul will
never be the same without you.

610
01:11:43,516 --> 01:11:46,017
See you in the restaurant car.

611
01:11:46,143 --> 01:11:49,896
I've had a particularly fascinating life.

612
01:11:50,022 --> 01:11:52,774
Would you like to hear about it?

613
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:54,901
You would?

614
01:12:19,633 --> 01:12:23,594
- You like it?
- Yes. It does rather suit you.

615
01:12:23,803 --> 01:12:26,388
I will save everything else for England.

616
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,932
It is four o'clock, you know.

617
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:32,268
This is not kulturny in the afternoon?

618
01:12:32,436 --> 01:12:34,228
Even on a honeymoon?

619
01:12:35,105 --> 01:12:37,607
Then I will... take it off.

620
01:12:39,693 --> 01:12:42,612
I think we're talking
at cross purposes again.

621
01:12:46,908 --> 01:12:48,533
Tania...

622
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:53,455
We'd better get dressed now.

623
01:12:53,539 --> 01:12:56,374
- Why?
- It's almost six.

624
01:12:57,418 --> 01:12:58,835
So?

625
01:12:59,503 --> 01:13:02,505
Well, it's... it's teatime!

626
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:05,466
We'll have it in here.

627
01:13:05,592 --> 01:13:10,554
- We'll have all our meals here.
- Yes, that would be splendid.

628
01:13:11,222 --> 01:13:14,725
But I've arranged to meet Kerim
in the restaurant car.

629
01:13:15,351 --> 01:13:18,936
You go alone. I will stay here.

630
01:13:19,063 --> 01:13:23,608
My dear Mrs. Somerset, we're supposed
to be a respectable English couple.

631
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:26,652
They would certainly have tea
in the restaurant.

632
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,114
Now, listen...

633
01:13:30,282 --> 01:13:31,949
Just do as I say, will you?

634
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,992
Yes, James.

635
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:38,038
But there are some English customs

636
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:41,625
- that are going to be changed.
- But of course, darling.

637
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,938
Do I look right, Mr. Somerset?

638
01:14:05,981 --> 01:14:07,899
Yes...

639
01:14:13,947 --> 01:14:16,032
Mrs. Somerset.

640
01:14:28,085 --> 01:14:29,628
Mr. Somerset!

641
01:14:31,505 --> 01:14:34,007
- You're the friend of Kerim Bey?
- Yes.

642
01:14:34,633 --> 01:14:38,345
There's been a terrible accident.
Please come with me.

643
01:14:38,845 --> 01:14:42,097
- No tea?
- Later. Keep the door locked.

644
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:01,949
They killed each other.

645
01:15:10,041 --> 01:15:13,001
This must be kept quiet
until we reach Trieste.

646
01:15:13,127 --> 01:15:15,170
It will be difficult.

647
01:15:15,254 --> 01:15:17,255
I'm sure.

648
01:15:18,007 --> 01:15:21,468
Kerim Bey was a very important man.
With many influential friends.

649
01:15:21,552 --> 01:15:24,220
I'm sure they also will reward you.

650
01:15:24,345 --> 01:15:26,972
I will try.

651
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,321
What is it?

652
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:33,576
- Kerim's dead.
- Dead?

653
01:16:36,747 --> 01:16:38,914
I want the truth.

654
01:16:39,749 --> 01:16:43,836
- James, you are hurting me!
- I'll do worse if you don't tell me!

655
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:47,089
You're doing this under orders, I know.
What are they?

656
01:16:47,214 --> 01:16:50,091
- I don't know what you mean.
- Liar!

657
01:16:52,428 --> 01:16:57,223
Even if you kill me, I can say nothing.

658
01:16:57,391 --> 01:17:01,561
I did not know anything
like Kerim's death would happen.

659
01:17:01,686 --> 01:17:04,479
But, when we get to England, I tell you.

660
01:17:04,605 --> 01:17:05,731
Go on.

661
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:13,655
Maybe they didn't let you in on all of it,
but, whatever you do know, tell me.

662
01:17:13,781 --> 01:17:18,201
- I know I love you, James. I love you.
- Just tell me.

663
01:17:18,285 --> 01:17:20,828
I love you, I love you, it's true.

664
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:25,166
Sure.

665
01:17:49,856 --> 01:17:53,108
Beograd! Beograd!

666
01:18:27,307 --> 01:18:29,350
Excuse me!

667
01:18:29,476 --> 01:18:32,603
- Can I borrow a match?
- I use a lighter.

668
01:18:32,729 --> 01:18:35,523
- Better still.
- Until they go wrong.

669
01:18:39,068 --> 01:18:43,113
My brother telephoned me.
Why did the train not stop?

670
01:18:43,197 --> 01:18:46,241
Well, I... I have some bad news.

671
01:18:47,326 --> 01:18:49,786
Your father's dead.

672
01:18:49,912 --> 01:18:51,454
Who did it? Tell me.

673
01:18:51,622 --> 01:18:55,166
He took care of that himself.
The other man died first.

674
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:57,459
Now, listen...

675
01:18:57,585 --> 01:19:01,964
I'll need help to get across the frontier
strip between Yugoslavia and Trieste.

676
01:19:02,048 --> 01:19:04,174
I want you to send
a message to M in London.

677
01:19:04,342 --> 01:19:07,886
Tell him to send someone
from Station Y to meet me in Zagreb.

678
01:19:08,054 --> 01:19:10,430
I will.

679
01:19:10,472 --> 01:19:12,515
Good.

680
01:19:15,561 --> 01:19:18,104
You'll... I think you'll want these.

681
01:19:20,983 --> 01:19:23,359
- Mr. Somerset, le train part.
- Thank you.

682
01:19:23,569 --> 01:19:25,444
- Ciao.
- The train is leaving!

683
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:12,891
- Nash, Captain Nash.
- Bond, travelling as Somerset.

684
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:15,060
My card.

685
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:18,021
What kept you?

686
01:22:18,105 --> 01:22:20,774
I'm so sorry,
I only got M's wire an hour ago.

687
01:22:20,983 --> 01:22:23,318
I busted every record getting here.

688
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:27,988
What were M's orders?

689
01:22:28,114 --> 01:22:31,283
Only to contact you
and the lady on the train.

690
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,453
Good. Come this way.

691
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:38,540
Thank you.

692
01:22:45,381 --> 01:22:47,465
This is my wife Caroline. Captain Nash.

693
01:22:47,549 --> 01:22:49,592
How do you do? So pleased to meet you.

694
01:22:49,718 --> 01:22:50,885
This way, Nash.

695
01:22:51,011 --> 01:22:52,762
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

696
01:22:58,601 --> 01:23:02,229
- Been long in Yugoslavia?
- About three years.

697
01:23:02,355 --> 01:23:05,857
- Interesting work?
- Yes. Sometimes.

698
01:23:06,025 --> 01:23:08,109
You know how it is, old man.

699
01:23:08,194 --> 01:23:10,403
You look very fit, Nash.

700
01:23:10,404 --> 01:23:13,198
Yes. I try to keep in shape.

701
01:23:15,325 --> 01:23:17,368
So what's our problem, sir?

702
01:23:18,286 --> 01:23:21,497
I can't risk taking this
through the customs...

703
01:23:21,623 --> 01:23:24,166
...at the Yugoslav-Trieste border.

704
01:23:24,292 --> 01:23:27,086
No stops till then. We'll have to jump off.

705
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:29,213
Can you get us across?

706
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:31,255
Any of the opposition around?

707
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:34,592
Not in any condition to worry about.

708
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:36,761
Good. We'll make it.

709
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:40,139
I know this territory
like the back of my hand.

710
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:46,145
Do you mind if we have a bite to eat?
I've been on the go since breakfast.

711
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:48,855
Of course not.
We'll go to the restaurant car.

712
01:23:48,981 --> 01:23:51,066
Go with Nash to the restaurant car.

713
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:53,151
I'll join you there in a few minutes.

714
01:23:53,277 --> 01:23:55,278
Whatever you say, old man.

715
01:23:55,446 --> 01:23:57,322
Excuse me.

716
01:24:30,812 --> 01:24:33,064
Excuse me.

717
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:40,612
There you are, old man.

718
01:24:40,738 --> 01:24:43,740
I was worried
something had happened to you.

719
01:24:49,829 --> 01:24:51,663
- Voilà, monsieur.
- Thank you.

720
01:24:52,332 --> 01:24:53,874
Thank you.

721
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,043
I'll have the grilled sole.

722
01:24:58,338 --> 01:25:00,422
And for madam. What about you, Nash?

723
01:25:01,716 --> 01:25:05,093
Yes, that sounds very nice.
Make that three of those, will you?

724
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:07,845
- Oui, monsieur.
- And a bottle of the blanc de blancs.

725
01:25:08,013 --> 01:25:10,431
- Make mine chianti.
- White chianti, monsieur?

726
01:25:10,515 --> 01:25:12,767
No, the red kind.

727
01:25:13,393 --> 01:25:17,730
Well, enjoy your dinner, old man. I think
I've got the answer to our problems.

728
01:25:17,856 --> 01:25:20,232
- Very simple, really.
- Good.

729
01:25:25,946 --> 01:25:28,948
We should reach the border
in about an hour.

730
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:30,950
I'm...

731
01:25:31,035 --> 01:25:34,245
...terribly sorry, Mrs. Somerset.
That was clumsy of me.

732
01:25:35,623 --> 01:25:37,498
- Waiter!
- Monsieur!

733
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:40,542
Waiter!

734
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:42,711
Tout de suite, monsieur!

735
01:25:49,802 --> 01:25:51,386
Excuse me. Merci.

736
01:25:51,512 --> 01:25:55,348
You'll... you'll find Trieste
quite interesting.

737
01:25:55,515 --> 01:25:57,558
Of course, it's not London.

738
01:25:59,352 --> 01:26:00,603
Cheerio.

739
01:26:01,730 --> 01:26:03,564
Cheerio.

740
01:26:17,036 --> 01:26:19,454
I don't feel very well.

741
01:26:20,914 --> 01:26:22,707
My head...

742
01:26:22,833 --> 01:26:24,834
The lady's come over faint.

743
01:26:24,959 --> 01:26:27,336
- Bring her in here.
- May I?

744
01:26:34,969 --> 01:26:38,096
- Let's go next door.
- Exhaustion, I'd say.

745
01:26:47,397 --> 01:26:50,858
What was it,
the stuff you put in her drink?

746
01:26:51,026 --> 01:26:53,319
Chloral hydrate. Quick, but mild.

747
01:26:53,486 --> 01:26:56,614
- And?
- Take it easy, 007.

748
01:26:59,116 --> 01:27:02,035
My escape route's only for one.

749
01:27:02,202 --> 01:27:04,787
What are you after?
The girl or the Lektor?

750
01:27:10,335 --> 01:27:12,003
All right.

751
01:27:12,796 --> 01:27:14,005
What is your plan?

752
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:18,758
- Explain it better on a map. All right?
- Sure.

753
01:27:22,346 --> 01:27:25,348
Now, we're here, you see?

754
01:27:26,434 --> 01:27:30,896
When we reach there, there's a steep
gradient, the train slows down there.

755
01:27:31,062 --> 01:27:35,482
We'll block the line, make for
that main road, pick up a car... there.

756
01:27:35,609 --> 01:27:37,484
A truck, in fact.

757
01:27:37,569 --> 01:27:40,154
That must be about 20 miles from here...

758
01:28:28,533 --> 01:28:29,533
Keep still.

759
01:28:32,454 --> 01:28:34,955
All right, now get up on your knees.

760
01:28:40,168 --> 01:28:44,005
Put your hands in your pockets.
Keep them there.

761
01:28:45,382 --> 01:28:49,343
Red wine with fish.
That should have told me something.

762
01:28:50,219 --> 01:28:52,387
You may know the right wines...

763
01:28:52,513 --> 01:28:54,764
...but you're the one on your knees.

764
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:56,891
How does it feel, old man?

765
01:28:58,310 --> 01:29:02,647
Old man? Is that what you chaps
in SMERSH call each other?

766
01:29:02,732 --> 01:29:04,899
SMERSH?

767
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:13,574
Of course. SPECTRE.

768
01:29:15,243 --> 01:29:17,619
Then it wasn't a Russian show at all.

769
01:29:17,745 --> 01:29:21,456
You've been playing us off
against each other, haven't you?

770
01:29:22,916 --> 01:29:26,711
Then it was SPECTRE who killed
the Russian agent in the mosque.

771
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:29,630
You?

772
01:29:32,217 --> 01:29:34,260
Kerim and the other man?

773
01:29:34,928 --> 01:29:36,679
And Nash?

774
01:29:36,805 --> 01:29:39,181
I don't mind talking.

775
01:29:39,306 --> 01:29:42,225
I get a kick out of watching
the great James Bond...

776
01:29:42,268 --> 01:29:45,728
...find out what a bloody fool
he's been making of himself.

777
01:29:45,896 --> 01:29:47,897
We're pros, Mr. Bond.

778
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:52,152
We sweated your recognition code
out of one of your men in Tokyo...

779
01:29:52,194 --> 01:29:55,572
...before he died.
I've been keeping tabs on you.

780
01:29:55,738 --> 01:29:58,323
I've been your guardian angel.

781
01:29:58,408 --> 01:30:00,659
Saved your life at the Gypsy camp.

782
01:30:01,744 --> 01:30:03,495
Oh, yes.

783
01:30:04,205 --> 01:30:06,290
I'm much obliged.

784
01:30:06,457 --> 01:30:10,293
We were keeping you alive
until you could get us the Lektor.

785
01:30:11,169 --> 01:30:14,964
So you had me deliver it on a plate.
That's brilliant.

786
01:30:15,924 --> 01:30:17,925
Go on. I'm fascinated.

787
01:30:18,051 --> 01:30:21,429
Now that we've got it,
you and the girl are expendable.

788
01:30:21,555 --> 01:30:23,556
Between here and Trieste.

789
01:30:26,767 --> 01:30:28,768
Girl?

790
01:30:28,936 --> 01:30:30,979
Isn't she working for SPECTRE, too?

791
01:30:31,105 --> 01:30:33,147
No.

792
01:30:33,315 --> 01:30:36,192
She thinks she's doing it all
for Mother Russia.

793
01:30:36,318 --> 01:30:38,778
She takes her orders
from Colonel Klebb.

794
01:30:40,197 --> 01:30:43,992
Rosa Klebb's Russian.
Head of operations for SMERSH.

795
01:30:44,075 --> 01:30:46,076
Was.

796
01:30:46,202 --> 01:30:48,245
Klebb works for SPECTRE now.

797
01:30:48,371 --> 01:30:50,288
The girl doesn't know that.

798
01:30:52,166 --> 01:30:54,209
Well, why kill her?

799
01:30:54,919 --> 01:30:56,670
Orders.

800
01:30:58,548 --> 01:31:00,632
That's only half of it, old man.

801
01:31:02,259 --> 01:31:04,510
Here's a roll of film.

802
01:31:04,636 --> 01:31:06,595
She'll have this in her handbag.

803
01:31:06,721 --> 01:31:09,515
And on you... they'll find this letter.

804
01:31:09,641 --> 01:31:13,519
It's from her,
threatening to give the film to the press...

805
01:31:13,645 --> 01:31:16,480
...unless you marry her
for helping you get the Lektor.

806
01:31:16,647 --> 01:31:18,648
What film?

807
01:31:19,942 --> 01:31:22,735
Taken in the bridal suite at your hotel.

808
01:31:23,821 --> 01:31:26,364
Something else the girl didn't know about.

809
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:28,533
Or you.

810
01:31:29,493 --> 01:31:33,955
You must be a pretty sick collection
of minds to dream up a plan like that.

811
01:31:34,038 --> 01:31:36,123
Can't you see the headlines?

812
01:31:36,249 --> 01:31:39,960
"British agent murders beautiful
Russian spy, then commits suicide."

813
01:31:41,129 --> 01:31:44,548
Tell me, which lunatic asylum
did they get you out of?

814
01:31:45,883 --> 01:31:49,177
Don't make it tougher on yourself!

815
01:31:52,514 --> 01:31:55,891
My orders are to kill you
and deliver the Lektor.

816
01:31:56,017 --> 01:31:58,227
How I do it is my business.

817
01:31:58,395 --> 01:32:00,187
It'll be slow and painful.

818
01:32:00,355 --> 01:32:02,690
How much are they paying you?

819
01:32:02,816 --> 01:32:04,650
What's it to you?

820
01:32:04,775 --> 01:32:07,193
We'll double it.

821
01:32:08,112 --> 01:32:10,238
Your word of honour?

822
01:32:11,115 --> 01:32:13,241
As an English gentleman?

823
01:32:19,789 --> 01:32:22,249
The first one won't kill you.

824
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:24,459
Not the second.

825
01:32:24,502 --> 01:32:26,586
Not even the third.

826
01:32:28,256 --> 01:32:31,758
Not till you crawl over here
and you kiss my foot.

827
01:32:35,096 --> 01:32:37,097
How about a cigarette?

828
01:32:37,222 --> 01:32:39,056
Not a chance.

829
01:32:41,267 --> 01:32:43,060
I'll pay for it.

830
01:32:43,228 --> 01:32:45,354
What with?

831
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:47,815
50 gold sovereigns.

832
01:32:47,941 --> 01:32:51,652
- Where are they?
- Up there, in my case.

833
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:03,871
You show me.

834
01:33:12,463 --> 01:33:15,006
Here you are. What about that cigarette?

835
01:33:15,883 --> 01:33:17,926
Throw 'em down there.

836
01:33:20,638 --> 01:33:22,639
Any more in the other case?

837
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:32,648
I should imagine so. It's standard kit.
I'll have a look.

838
01:33:32,774 --> 01:33:34,358
Hands back in your pockets!

839
01:33:40,405 --> 01:33:42,615
Keep them there.

840
01:36:10,128 --> 01:36:12,129
You won't be needing this...

841
01:36:13,089 --> 01:36:15,090
...old man.

842
01:36:30,272 --> 01:36:32,774
Tania! Wake up!

843
01:36:32,941 --> 01:36:35,693
Wake up, or I'll leave you behind.

844
01:36:35,861 --> 01:36:36,736
Tania...

845
01:36:36,779 --> 01:36:39,530
...wake up or I'll leave you behind,
do you hear me?

846
01:36:39,655 --> 01:36:42,324
Don't leave me. Never leave me.

847
01:36:48,456 --> 01:36:52,792
Tania! This is Nash's escape route.
You understand?

848
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:56,838
We've got to get off here. Take this.

849
01:36:57,005 --> 01:36:58,547
Come on.

850
01:37:03,178 --> 01:37:05,637
We must get
to the other side of the train.

851
01:37:05,805 --> 01:37:07,264
Under here.

852
01:37:54,392 --> 01:37:56,768
Grant! Where are you?

853
01:37:57,770 --> 01:37:59,104
Grant!

854
01:38:07,404 --> 01:38:08,487
Excuse me.

855
01:38:38,141 --> 01:38:40,183
Now don't run away.

856
01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:42,436
Come on!

857
01:38:42,604 --> 01:38:46,315
- Come on, or I'll leave you here!
- Stay here with me.

858
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,283
Sleep it off in there.

859
01:38:57,367 --> 01:39:00,494
You'll feel better in the morning.

860
01:39:02,705 --> 01:39:04,914
Come on, wake up.

861
01:40:05,556 --> 01:40:08,141
Try and straddle the truck.

862
01:40:20,903 --> 01:40:23,447
I'll get them away from here.

863
01:40:23,572 --> 01:40:25,364
You hide under the truck.

864
01:41:47,692 --> 01:41:48,942
Quick!

865
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:25,977
I'd say one of their aircraft is missing.

866
01:42:39,198 --> 01:42:41,449
Tania!

867
01:42:42,201 --> 01:42:46,037
- Here, take this, and cast the rope off.
- All right.

868
01:42:47,832 --> 01:42:49,332
Where's the key?

869
01:42:49,541 --> 01:42:53,085
- Where's the key?!
- In my coat. In the pocket.

870
01:42:56,965 --> 01:42:59,007
All right, get out. Move.

871
01:42:59,926 --> 01:43:00,968
In the boat.

872
01:43:19,986 --> 01:43:21,695
Do you swim?

873
01:43:22,488 --> 01:43:25,448
Here, take the wheel. This way, please.

874
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:28,827
Mind the step.

875
01:43:32,957 --> 01:43:35,458
Just isn't your day, is it?

876
01:43:40,255 --> 01:43:43,048
- Where are we going?
- Venice.

877
01:43:43,424 --> 01:43:45,425
Take a look at that locker, will you?

878
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:47,427
Charts,

879
01:43:47,553 --> 01:43:49,596
pistol, some flares.

880
01:43:49,722 --> 01:43:52,057
Give me those charts.

881
01:43:57,354 --> 01:44:00,147
Yes, we're here. Near Istria.

882
01:44:03,068 --> 01:44:06,612
There's plenty of fuel. With a bit of luck
we'll be there by morning.

883
01:44:10,491 --> 01:44:14,661
Three man were found dead on the train
at Trieste. One of them was Grant.

884
01:44:14,745 --> 01:44:17,038
What have you to say, Number Five?

885
01:44:17,164 --> 01:44:19,832
He was Klebb's choice.
Her people failed.

886
01:44:19,917 --> 01:44:23,002
It was your plan!
They followed it implicitly!

887
01:44:23,087 --> 01:44:25,838
Impossible. It was perfect.

888
01:44:26,005 --> 01:44:28,715
Except for one thing.
They were dealing with Bond.

889
01:44:28,841 --> 01:44:30,842
Who is Bond...

890
01:44:30,927 --> 01:44:32,844
...compared with Kronsteen?

891
01:44:32,970 --> 01:44:35,430
Exactly. What have you to say to that,

892
01:44:35,515 --> 01:44:37,682
Number Three?

893
01:44:43,730 --> 01:44:47,566
Bond is still alive and the Lektor
is not yet in our possession.

894
01:44:47,692 --> 01:44:51,487
I have already negotiated
with the Russians to return it to them.

895
01:44:51,655 --> 01:44:56,533
We've agreed a price. And SPECTRE
always delivers what it promises.

896
01:44:56,701 --> 01:45:00,412
Our whole organisation depends
on our keeping those promises.

897
01:45:03,248 --> 01:45:04,832
I warned you.

898
01:45:04,917 --> 01:45:08,795
We do not tolerate failure, Number Three.
You know the penalty.

899
01:45:08,879 --> 01:45:11,631
Yes, Number One.

900
01:45:12,716 --> 01:45:15,218
Our rules are very simple. lf you fail...

901
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:34,777
...12 seconds. One day we must
invent a faster-working venom.

902
01:45:35,987 --> 01:45:37,321
Number Three!

903
01:45:37,656 --> 01:45:38,405
Yes!

904
01:45:38,406 --> 01:45:41,659
I do not wish to tell the Russians
there will be another delay.

905
01:45:41,785 --> 01:45:43,869
There will be no delay, Number One.

906
01:45:53,378 --> 01:45:55,546
Which way are we going?

907
01:45:55,714 --> 01:45:59,217
The shortest route,
which is between those two mountains

908
01:45:59,343 --> 01:46:02,428
and straight along the coast.

909
01:46:17,401 --> 01:46:19,444
Ahoy, Mr. Bond!

910
01:46:22,781 --> 01:46:25,074
Heave to, heave to!

911
01:46:45,719 --> 01:46:48,262
You're trapped, Mr. Bond.

912
01:46:48,430 --> 01:46:52,433
You cannot escape!

913
01:46:53,184 --> 01:46:55,935
Rifle grenade, prepare to fire.

914
01:46:58,689 --> 01:47:01,483
We're coming through!
Pull over, SPECTRE Green.

915
01:47:01,609 --> 01:47:04,277
Get out of the way!
Give them a warning shot.

916
01:47:06,696 --> 01:47:08,113
Rifle grenade, fire!

917
01:47:12,368 --> 01:47:13,702
Forward machine gun, fire!

918
01:47:16,706 --> 01:47:18,207
You're firing too close.

919
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:21,293
SPECTRE Red, SPECTRE Green,
you're firing too close.

920
01:47:23,879 --> 01:47:26,631
You're trying to stop them,
not to sink them!

921
01:47:36,016 --> 01:47:38,309
Here, take the wheel.

922
01:47:52,198 --> 01:47:54,032
Slow down.

923
01:47:55,992 --> 01:47:58,952
Slow down. Slow down all boats.

924
01:48:00,288 --> 01:48:02,956
Green, go alongside
while we keep you covered.

925
01:48:06,252 --> 01:48:08,295
- Hands up, Mr. Bond!
- Why give up?

926
01:48:08,421 --> 01:48:11,882
- Without the drums, we can go faster...
- Hand me the flare pistol.

927
01:48:12,007 --> 01:48:16,302
Keep your hands up, Mr. Bond.
We're sending a boat to take you off.

928
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:31,149
There's a saying in England.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

929
01:48:38,365 --> 01:48:40,909
Green, change your course! Go astern!

930
01:48:42,536 --> 01:48:45,163
Change course!

931
01:48:47,373 --> 01:48:50,542
All boats, throw out your ammunition!
Get rid of it! Quick!

932
01:48:53,755 --> 01:48:54,755
Get rid of it!

933
01:48:58,593 --> 01:48:59,843
Jump! Jump!

934
01:49:21,322 --> 01:49:23,698
Don't go away.

935
01:49:27,036 --> 01:49:28,411
Yes?

936
01:49:28,662 --> 01:49:30,538
Thanks. Tell him to wait, will you?

937
01:49:30,622 --> 01:49:33,041
And send up a porter.

938
01:49:33,207 --> 01:49:34,583
Avanti!

939
01:49:35,334 --> 01:49:38,587
- Permesso, signore.
- Sى, prego.

940
01:49:38,671 --> 01:49:41,465
And also get me the British Consul.

941
01:49:42,258 --> 01:49:43,467
Thank you.

942
01:50:09,616 --> 01:50:11,909
Yes? Mr. Maxwell, please.

943
01:50:12,036 --> 01:50:15,371
- James Bond.
- James, we will miss the plane. We will...

944
01:50:15,456 --> 01:50:18,249
Hello, Paul. Bond here.

945
01:50:18,292 --> 01:50:21,586
I want to thank you.
Tell the office we're on our way.

946
01:50:21,711 --> 01:50:24,421
What was that?

947
01:50:25,464 --> 01:50:27,507
Here, leave that! I'll take it.

948
01:50:29,468 --> 01:50:32,596
Should be routine from here on in.
Not so many times...

949
01:50:34,181 --> 01:50:36,683
What was that you were saying?
Hello, hello?

950
01:50:36,766 --> 01:50:38,142
Klebb.

951
01:50:39,185 --> 01:50:42,187
James, are you still there? Hello!

952
01:50:47,527 --> 01:50:50,446
Romanova,... the door!

953
01:51:16,679 --> 01:51:18,680
Take this.

954
01:52:21,781 --> 01:52:23,615
Horrible woman.

955
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:26,702
Yes. She's had her kicks.

956
01:52:43,802 --> 01:52:46,387
Here you are.
In case you ever need it again.

957
01:52:46,387 --> 01:52:49,889
Oh, yes. All government property
has to be accounted for.

958
01:52:50,057 --> 01:52:53,977
But as I said before, we won't always
work on the company's time, will we?

959
01:52:54,061 --> 01:52:55,395
No.

960
01:53:00,568 --> 01:53:03,987
James, behave yourself.
We are being filmed.

961
01:53:06,489 --> 01:53:09,074
Oh, not again.

962
01:53:15,289 --> 01:53:17,416
He was right, you know.

963
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:20,293
- What is it?
- I'll show you.
