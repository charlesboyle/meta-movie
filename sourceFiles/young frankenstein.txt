1
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,520
If we look at the base of a brain
which has just been removed from a skull,...

2
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,810
..there's very little of the midbrain
that we can actually see.

3
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,110
Yet, as demonstrated
in my lecture last week,...

4
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,280
..if the under aspects of the temporal lobes
are gently pulled apart,...

5
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,290
..the upper portion of the stem of the brain
can be seen.

6
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,710
This so-called brainstem
consists of the midbrain,...

7
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,210
..a rounded protrusion called the pons,...

8
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,510
..and a stalk tapering downwards
called the medulla oblongata...

9
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,390
..which passes out of the skull
through the foramen magnum...

10
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,390
..and becomes, of course, the spinal cord.

11
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,980
Are there any questions before we proceed?

12
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,480
I have one question, Dr Frankenstein.

13
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,490
That's Fronkonsteen.

14
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,490
I beg your pardon?

15
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,280
My name. It's pronounced "Fronkonsteen".

16
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,410
But aren't you the grandson
of the famous Dr Victor Frankenstein,...

17
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,420
..who dug up freshly buried corpses
and transformed dead components into...

18
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,210
Yes, yes!

19
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,510
Yes!

20
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,590
We all know what he did!

21
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,180
But I'd rather be remembered
for my own small contributions to science...

22
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,390
..and not because of
my accidental relationship...

23
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,100
..to a famous... cuckoo!

24
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,820
Now, if you don't mind,
can we have your question?

25
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,280
Well, sir, I'm not sure
I understand the distinction...

26
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,410
..between reflexive
and voluntary nerve impulses.

27
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,700
Good. Since our lab work today
is a demonstration of just that distinction,...

28
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
..why don't we proceed?

29
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,050
Mr Hilltop here,
with whom I have never worked...

30
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,930
..or given any prior instructions to,...

31
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,940
..has graciously offered his services
for today's demonstration.

32
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,020
Mr Hilltop, would you hop up on your feet
and stand beside this table?

33
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,040
Nice... hopping.

34
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,250
Mr Hilltop,...

35
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,340
..would you raise... your left knee, please?

36
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,760
You have just witnessed
a voluntary nerve impulse.

37
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,930
lt begins as a stimulus
from the cerebral cortex,...

38
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,560
..passes through the brainstem
and to the muscles involved.

39
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,940
Mr Hilltop, you may lower your knee.

40
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:08,150
Reflex movements are those
which are made independently of the will,...

41
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,650
..but are carried out along pathways...

42
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,160
..which pass between the peripheral nervous
system and the central nervous system.

43
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,660
You filthy, rotten, yellow son of a bitch!

44
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,330
We are not aware of these impulses.

45
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,460
Neither do we intend them
to carry out our contraction of muscles.

46
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,040
Yet, as you can see, they work by themselves.

47
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,340
But what if we block the nerve impulse
by simply applying local pressure,...

48
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,550
..which can be done
with any ordinary metal clamp...

49
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,060
..just at the swelling
on the posterior nerve roots...

50
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,350
..for, oh, say... five or six seconds?

51
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,400
Why, you mother-grabbing bastard!

52
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,700
As you can see,
all communication is shut off.

53
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,870
ln spite of our mechanical magnificence,...

54
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,580
..if it were not for this continuous stream
of motor impulses,...

55
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
..we would collapse...

56
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,170
..like a bunch of broccoli!

57
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Ohhh!

58
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,970
ln conclusion, it should be noted...

59
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,480
- Give him an extra dollar.
- Extra dollar. Yes, sir.

60
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,560
..that any more than common injury...

61
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,070
- ..to the nerve root is always serious.

62
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,780
Because once a nerve fibre is severed,...

63
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,870
..there is no way, in heaven or on earth,...

64
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,080
..to regenerate life back into it.

65
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,790
Are there any last questions before we leave?

66
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,790
Uh, Dr Frank...

67
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,500
- Fronkonsteen...
- Yes?

68
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,800
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved
a piece of vermicelli in a glass case...

69
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,180
..until, by some extraordinary means,...

70
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,890
..it actually began to move
with a voluntary motion?

71
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,600
Are you speaking of the worm
or the spaghetti?

72
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,900
Why, the worm, sir.

73
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,480
Yes! lt seems to me l did read something
of that incident when l was a student.

74
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,200
But you have to remember that a worm,
with very few exceptions,...

75
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,570
..is not a human being.

76
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,370
But wasn't that the basis
of your grandfather's work, sir?

77
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,660
The reanimation of dead tissue?

78
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,670
My grandfather was a very sick man.

79
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,630
But as a Fronkonsteen,
aren't you the least bit curious about it?

80
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,130
Doesn't bringing back to life what was
once dead hold any intrigue for you?

81
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,640
You are talking about
the nonsensical ravings of a lunatic mind.

82
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,930
Dead is dead!

83
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,810
But look at what has been done
with hearts and kidneys.

84
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,520
Hearts and kidneys are Tinkertoys!

85
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,020
l'm talking about the central nervous system!

86
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
But, sir...

87
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,820
l am a scientist, not a philosopher!

88
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,740
You have more chance
of reanimating this scalpel...

89
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,120
..than of mending a broken nervous system!

90
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,120
- But what about your grandfather's work?
- My grandfather's work was doo-doo!

91
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,210
I am not interested in death!

92
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,000
The only thing that concerns me
is the preservation of life!

93
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,430
Class...

94
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,640
..is...

95
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,430
..dismissed.

96
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,900
Dr Frankenstein...

97
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,530
That's... Fronkonsteen.

98
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.

99
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,420
l have travelled 5,000 miles to bring you
the will of your great-grandfather.

100
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,720
Baron Beaufort von Frankenstein.

101
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,770
Oh, my sweet darling.

102
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,360
Oh, my dearest love.
I'll count the hours that you're away.

103
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,450
Oh, darling, so will I.

104
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,780
- Not on the lips.
- What?

105
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:29,370
I'm going to that part at Nanna and Nicky's
later. I don't wanna smear my lipstick.

106
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,250
- You understand.
- Of course.

107
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,960
All aboard!

108
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,580
- Oh, dear!
- Well... l guess this is it.

109
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,670
Freddy, darling!

110
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,970
Oh, how can l say in a few minutes
what it's taken me a lifetime to understand?

111
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,260
- Won't you try?
- All right.

112
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,260
You've got it, mister.

113
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,680
I'm yours. All of me. What else can l say?

114
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,270
My sweet love...

115
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,650
The hair! The hair! Just been set.

116
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,770
Sorry... Sorry.

117
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,070
I hope you like old-fashioned weddings.

118
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,360
I prefer old-fashioned wedding nights!

119
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,570
Oh! You're incorrigible!

120
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,780
Does that mean...

121
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,450
- ..you love me?
- You bet your boots it does.

122
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,370
Oh, my only love.

123
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,580
Taffeta, darling.

124
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,750
Taffeta, sweetheart.

125
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,460
No, the dress is taffeta.

126
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,550
- It wrinkles so easily.
- Oh.

127
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,260
All aboard!

128
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,470
Oh, there's that horrid man again.

129
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,470
Well, hurry now,
before l make a fool of myself.

130
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
Oh! Nails! Oh...

131
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,270
Sorry...

132
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,780
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Freddy.

133
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,080
Darling!

134
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,810
- Harry, he was at it again.
- So what do you want me to do about it?

135
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,400
Every day!

136
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,310
Let him! Let him!

137
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,190
New York next! Everybody out for New York!

138
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,310
Pardon me, boy!
Is this the Transylvania Station?

139
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,730
Ja,ja! Track 29!

140
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,310
Oh! Can l give you a shine?

141
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
Uh... No, thanks.

142
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,300
Dr Frankenstein?

143
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,100
Fronkonsteen.

144
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,020
You're putting me on.

145
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,530
No. It's pronounced Fronkonsteen.

146
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,860
Do you also say Frodorick?

147
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,950
No. Frederick.

148
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,240
Well, why isn't it Frodorick Fronkonsteen?

149
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,040
It isn't. It's Frederick Fronkonsteen.

150
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,830
I see.

151
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,330
You must be Igor.

152
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,040
No. It's pronounced I-gor.

153
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,630
- But they told me it was Igor.
- Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?

154
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,840
Uh... You were sent by
Herr Falkstein, weren't you?

155
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,270
Yes. My grandfather
used to work for your grandfather.

156
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,140
How nice.

157
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,350
Of course, the rates have gone up.

158
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,570
Of course. l'm sure we'll get along splendidly.

159
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,650
- Oh!

160
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,360
Sorry. I... Uh...

161
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,240
You know, l don't mean to embarrass you,
but l'm a rather brilliant surgeon.

162
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,830
Perhaps l could help you with that hump.

163
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
What hump?

164
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,130
Let's go.

165
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,340
Allow me, master.

166
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,050
Oh... Thanks very much.

167
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,850
Walk this way.

168
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,060
This way.

169
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,460
l think you'll be more comfortable in the rear.

170
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,330
Oh...

171
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,840
- Ooh!
- What was that?

172
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Oh, that'll be Inga.

173
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,300
Herr Falkstein thought you might need
a laboratory assistant temporarily.

174
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Oh.

175
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,680
Ooh!

176
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,270
Hello!
Would you like to have a roll in the hay?

177
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,270
It's fun!

178
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,190
Roll, roll

179
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,900
Roll in the hay

180
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,490
- Hah!
- Oh...

181
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
Oh!

182
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,510
Sometimes l am afraid of the lightning.

183
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,970
lt's just an atmospheric discharge.

184
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,180
Nothing to be afraid of.

185
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,610
Werewolf!

186
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,770
Werewolf?!

187
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,990
- There!
- What?

188
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,910
There wolf!

189
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,070
There castle!

190
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
Why are you talking that way?

191
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,290
- I thought you wanted to.
- No, I don't want to!

192
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,370
Suit yourself. I'm easy.

193
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,170
Well...

194
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,010
There it is.

195
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,800
Home.

196
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,540
What knockers!

197
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,040
Oh... Thank you, Doctor.

198
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,050
Oh. That's all right.

199
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,340
There we are.

200
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,230
I am Frau Blucher.

201
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,110
Steady!

202
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,330
How do you do? I am Dr Fronkonsteen.

203
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,910
This is my assistant.
Inga, may I present Frau Blucher?
 
204
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,732

204
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,630
Your rooms have been prepared, Herr Doktor.

205
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,220
If you will follow me.

206
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,010
I-gor! Would you bring the bags
as soon as you're finished, please?

207
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,850
Yes, master.

208
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,930
After you, Frau Blucher.

209
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,450
- Blucher!

210
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Follow me, please.

211
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,990
Stay close to the candles.

212
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,960
The staircase... can be treacherous.

213
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,590
Und this is your room.
It was your grandfather Victor's room.

214
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,890
I see.

215
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,390
Well! Seem to be quite a few books.

216
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,270
This was Victor's...

217
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,190
..the Baron's medical library.

218
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,360
- Where is my grandfather's private library?
- l don't know what you mean, sir.

219
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,660
Well, these books are very general.
Any doctor might have them in his study.

220
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,160
This is the only library I know of,
Dr Frankenstone.

221
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,080
- Fronkonsteen.
- Fronkonsteen.

222
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,170
Well, we'll see.

223
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,170
Good night.

224
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,260
Would the doctor care for a brandy
before retiring?

225
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,390
No... Thank you.

226
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,180
Some warm milk...

227
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,060
..perhaps?

228
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,980
No... thank you very much.

229
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,860
No, thanks.

230
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,070
Ovaltine?

231
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,280
Nothing!

232
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,200
Thank you.

233
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,330
I'm a little tired.

234
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,840
Then I will say... good night.

235
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,800
Good night!

236
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,020
Good night, darling.

237
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,610
Good night, Herr Doktor.

238
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,110
Good night, Frau Blucher.

239
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,720
No, no, no, no, no, no.

240
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,310
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

241
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,110
I'm not a Frankenstein.

242
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,030
I am not a Frankenstein!

243
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,530
I'm a Fronkonsteen!

244
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,330
Don't gimme that!

245
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,540
I don't believe in fate!

246
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And I won't say it.

247
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,630
All right, you win! You win! I give.

248
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,630
I'll say it. I'll say it, I'll say it.

249
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,930
Destiny! Destiny!

250
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,930
No escaping that for me!

251
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,100
Destiny! Destiny!

252
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,640
No escaping that for me!

253
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,980
Destiny! Destiny...

254
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,150
No escaping...

255
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,440
Dr Fronkonsteen! Wake up!

256
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,860
What is it?

257
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,950
You were having a nightmare.

258
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,870
- What's that strange music?
- I have no idea.

259
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,370
But it seems to be coming...

260
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,880
..from behind the bookcase.

261
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,550
Behind the bookcase...

262
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,970
Hand me that robe, would you, dear?

263
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,060
You were right.
It's coming from behind this wall.

264
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,480
Where is it?

265
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,440
- Where is it?
- What?

266
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,650
There's always a device.
If l can just spot the triggering mechanism...

267
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,940
Hello!

268
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,250
It seems louder over here.

269
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,380
Hand me that candle, will you?

270
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,050
Put... the candle... back!

271
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,480
All right! I think I have it figured out now.

272
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,060
Take out the candle...

273
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,770
..and I'll block the bookcase with my body.

274
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,160
Listen to me very carefully.

275
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,750
Don't put the candle back!

276
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,080
With all of your might,...

277
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,880
..shove against the other side
of the bookcase.

278
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,010
Is that... perfectly clear?

279
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,300
I think so.

280
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Good girl!

281
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,400
Put... the candle... back!

282
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,990
Oh, look, Doctor! A passageway!

283
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,210
Whatever that music is,
it's coming from down there.

284
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:11,920
- l'd better take a look.
- Oh, let me come with you, Doctor, please.

285
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,090
l don't wanna stay up here alone.

286
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,090
All right, then.
Close your robe and follow me.

287
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
Oh, Doctor! The candle...

288
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,390
Good thinking. Let's try this one.

289
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,310
Stand back!

290
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,010
Don't be frightened, dear. Just a rat.

291
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,180
A filthy, slimy rat!

292
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,550
Good Lord!

293
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,350
Oh!

294
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,450
- I...
- Ohh!

295
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,950
Ain't got nobody

296
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,660
And nobody cares for me

297
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,540
- I-gor!
- Frodorick.

298
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,750
How did you get here?

299
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,630
Through the dumbwaiter.

300
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,630
I heard the strangest music from the upstairs
kitchen and l just... followed it down.

301
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,760
Call it... a hunch.

302
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,930
Brrrm-chee!

303
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,350
There must have been
someone else down here.

304
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,560
It would seem that way.

305
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,850
And there's the only other door.

306
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,730
Wait, master.

307
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,860
It might be dangerous.

308
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,860
You go first.

309
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,620
Aren't there any lights in this place?

310
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:01,250
Two nasty-looking switches over here,
but l'm not going to be the first.

311
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,460
Well...

312
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,590
Damn your eyes!

313
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Too late!

314
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,280
So this is where it all happened.

315
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,460
Just think!A dead brain
ready to live again in a new body!

316
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,090
Look! No blood, no decomposition.

317
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
Just a few sutures.

318
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,180
- Throw the main switch.
- Yes, master.

319
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,270
What a filthy mess!

320
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,190
I dunno. A little paint, a few flowers,
couple of throw pillows...

321
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,580
Well, it seems as if our mysterious violinist
has disa...p...

322
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,290
- Disa... what?
- ..peared.

323
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,000
Ssh!

324
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,670
There is a light
coming from behind that door.

325
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,170
Follow me!

326
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,410
Doctor! Look!

327
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,540
Well... This explains the music.

328
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,130
- It's still warm.
- Mm.

329
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,210
But who was playing it?

330
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,920
I don't know...

331
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,720
..but whoever it was just barely finished
putting out his cigar.

332
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,510
Such strange goings-on!

333
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,140
What is this place?

334
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,140
Music room?

335
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,810
But there's nothing here
but books and papers!

336
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,440
Books and papers?

337
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,820
It is!

338
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,110
This is my grandfather's private library!
I feel it!

339
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,740
Look! Look at this!

340
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:55,010
"Until, from the midst of this
darkness, a sudden light broke in upon me."

341
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,520
"A light so brilliant and wondrous,
and yet so simple."

342
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,310
"Change the poles from plus to minus...

343
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
..and from minus to plus."

344
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,240
"l alone succeeded in discovering
the secret of bestowing life."

345
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,910
"Nay, even more..."

346
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,120
"I myself... became capable
of bestowing animation...

347
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,540
..upon lifeless matter!"

348
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,970
It... could... work!

349
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,280
- Kipper?
- Mm. Thank you, Doctor.

350
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:07,170
"As the minuteness of the parts
formed a hindrance to my speed,...

351
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,750
..I resolved therefore
to make the creature of a gigantic stature."

352
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,470
Of course!

353
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,550
That would simplify everything.

354
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,350
In other words,...

355
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:26,190
..his veins, his feet, his hands, his organs
would all have to be increased in size.

356
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,350
Exactly.

357
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,980
He would have an enormous Schwanzstuck!

358
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,780
That goes without saying.

359
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,780
Woof!

360
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,250
He's gonna be very popular.

361
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,250
So then...

362
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,460
What we're aiming for is a being
approximately seven feet in height,...

363
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,550
..with all features either congenitally
or artificially proportionate in size.

364
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,680
Something like...

365
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,180
..this?

366
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,270
Hello...

367
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,480
You've caught something there.

368
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,150
Crude, yes, primitive, yes,
perhaps even grotesque,...

369
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,990
..yet something inexplicable tells me...

370
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:21,200
..that this might be our man!

371
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,430
All right, all right.

372
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,090
That's good enough for the likes of 'im.

373
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,200
Get down, you fool!

374
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,620
Now!

375
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,700
What a filthy job!

376
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,490
- Could be worse.
- How?

377
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,700
Could be raining.

378
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,170
Quick!

379
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,470
Need a hand?

380
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:47,050
Uh... No, thanks. I have one.
Thanks very much all the same.

381
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,930
Just a moment, sir!

382
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,770
I know everyone around here,
but I've never seen your face before.

383
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,060
Can you account for yourself?

384
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:59,230
Yes. I am Dr Frederick Fronkonsteen,
newly arrived from America.

385
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,150
Oh, yes, sir! I was told you were here.

386
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,450
Well, I'm Constable Henry, sir.
Pleased to meet you.

387
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,660
How very nice to meet you, Constable.

388
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,750
- Why, you're chilled to the bone, sir.
- Ooh!

389
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,830
- A nice, warm fire would be the thing for you.
- Yes, yes.

390
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,250
A little nip from the old bottle
wouldn't be too bad either, sir.

391
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,750
That's the ticket, yes!

392
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,340
Well, if you have everything in hand, sir,
I'll say good night.

393
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,550
Thank you very much, Constable.

394
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,640
- At your service, sir, always.

395
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,350
- Good night, Constable.
- Good night, sir.

396
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,580
Oh, what an awesome sight!

397
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,790
What a profound and reverend night is this.

398
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,510
With such a specimen for a body,...

399
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:09,300
..all we need now is
an equally magnificent brain.

400
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,390
- You know what to do?
- l have a pretty good idea.

401
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Good man.

402
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,610
Didn't you... Didn't you use to have that
on the other side?

403
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,770
- What?
- Your, uh...

404
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,780
Oh, never mind.

405
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:33,080
- Do you have that name I gave you?
- l have it written down.

406
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,290
- H Delbruck.
- Hans Delbruck.

407
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,110
- He is hideous.
- He's beautiful.

408
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:39,740
And he is mine!

409
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,550
Hurry now.
We're fighting time and the elements.

410
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,630
- Are you ready?
- Are you sure this is how they did it?

411
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,430
Yes, yes! It's all written down in the notes!

412
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,640
Now tie off the kites
and hurry down as fast as you can.

413
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,350
What's the hurry?

414
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:06,230
There's a possibility of electrocution.
Do you understand?

415
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:13,950
I say "There's a possibility of electrocution!"

416
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,610
Do you understand?

417
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,120
I understand, I understand.
Why are you shouting?

418
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,080
Did you...

419
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,460
- Did you tie off the kites?
- Of course.

420
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,090
Oh... All right. Good.

421
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,670
- Uh... Check the generator.
- Yes, master.

422
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,560
l-gor!

423
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,980
- Release the safety valve on the main wheel.
- Yes, master.

424
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:58,070
Can you imagine the brain of Hans Delbruck
in this body?

425
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,660
Oh, Frederick!

426
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,290
This is the moment.

427
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,290
Well, dear...

428
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,460
Are you ready?

429
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,670
Yes, Doctor.

430
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,260
Elevate me.

431
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,970
Now? Right here?

432
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,470
Yes, yes. Raise the platform.

433
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,560
Oh! The platform!

434
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,770
Oh, that! Ja... yes.

435
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:48,580
From that fateful day
when stinking bits of slime...

436
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:53,290
..first crawled from the sea
and shouted to the cold stars...

437
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,760
.."I am man!",...

438
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:02,680
..our greatest dread has always been
the knowledge of our own mortality.

439
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,680
But tonight...

440
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:08,480
..we shall hurl the gauntlet of science...

441
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,520
..into the frightful face of death itself.

442
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
Tonight...

443
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,030
..we shall ascend into the heavens!

444
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,410
We shall mock the earthquake!

445
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,620
We shall command the thunders...

446
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,620
..and penetrate...

447
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:37,130
..into the very womb
of impervious nature herself!

448
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,230
When I give the word,
throw the first switch!

449
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,940
You've got it, master.

450
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,110
Get ready!

451
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,610
Get set!

452
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,320
Go!

453
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:13,120
Throw the second switch!

454
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,710
Throw the third switch!

455
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,930
Not... the third switch?

456
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,430
Throw it, I say! Throw it!

457
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,110
Life!

458
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,320
Life, do you hear me?

459
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,030
Give my creation...

460
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,200
..life!

461
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,640
Turn everything off and bring me down!

462
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,960
Nothing!

463
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,550
- Oh, Doctor. I'm sorry...
- No, no.

464
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,970
Be of good cheer.

465
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,470
If science teaches us anything,...

466
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,480
..it teaches us to accept our failures...

467
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,440
..as well as our successes...

468
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:44,400
..with quiet... dignity...

469
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:48,610
..and grace.

470
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,580
Son of a bitch, bastard! I'll get you for this!

471
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,710
What did you do to me?

472
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,220
- What did you do to me?
- Doctor! Doctor! Stop it!

473
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,590
You'll kill him!

474
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,890
Agh!

475
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,720
l don't wanna live!

476
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,100
l do not want to live!

477
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,390
Quiet dignity and grace.

478
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,110
Ohhh! Mama!

479
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:29,200
Oh, tosh! This man is different, I tell you!

480
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,910
You can see that after you've talked to him
for five minutes.

481
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,790
Yes?

482
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,410
He's a Frankenstein!

483
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,710
- And they're all alike!

484
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,880
It's in their blood. They can't 'elp it.

485
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:50,220
All those scientists, they're all alike.

486
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:53,010
They say they're working FOR us.

487
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:56,680
What they really want is to rule the world!

488
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,110
That's enough now! I will not have
this meeting become a free-for-all!

489
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,200
These are very serious charges
you're making,...

490
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,200
..and all the more painful to us, your elders,
because we still have nightmares...

491
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,790
..from five times before.

492
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Now... we haven't heard from the one man
most qualified to judge the situation fairly.

493
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,840
Inspector Kemp!

494
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,340
Will you talk to us, please?

495
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,620
A riot... is an ugly thing...

496
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:08,840
..und once you get one started...

497
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,340
..there is little chance of stopping it...

498
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,340
..short of bloodshed.

499
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,220
l think... before we go around killing people,...

500
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:27,440
..we had better make damn sure
of our evidence.

501
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,150
Und...

502
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:38,530
..we had better confirm the fact...

503
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,540
..that young Frankenstein is indeed...

504
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,330
..vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps!

505
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,630
What?

506
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,550
Vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps!
Vootstaps!

507
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,260
Oh! Footsteps!

508
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,340
I think...

509
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:56,760
..what is in order...

510
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,560
..is for me to pay a little visit
on the good doctor...

511
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:09,860
..und to have a nice... quiet... chat.

512
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:17,200
Reputation!

513
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,370
Reputation!

514
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,080
Oh, Doctor!
You mustn't do this to yourself.

515
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:27,170
You've got to stop thinking about it.

516
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:30,790
Why, look!
You haven't even touched your food.

517
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,380
There!

518
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:38,090
Now I've touched it. Happy?

519
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,890
You know... I'll never forget my old dad.

520
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:48,600
When these things would happen to him...
the things he'd say to me.

521
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,560
What did he say?

522
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,480
What the hell are you doin'
in the bathroom day and night?

523
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:59,070
Why don't you get outta there
and give someone else a chance?

524
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,580
Oh, maybe it's better this way.

525
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:10,790
The poor lifeless hulk.

526
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,380
Maybe it is better off dead.

527
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,190
What is this?

528
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,400
Schwarzwalder Kirschtorte.

529
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:44,580
Oh, do you like it? I'm not partial to
desserts myself, but this is excellent.

530
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,870
Who are you talking to?

531
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:52,000
To you! You just made a yummy sound,
so I thought you liked the dessert.

532
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:55,290
I didn't make a yummy sound.
I just asked you what it is.

533
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,590
- But you did. I just heard it.
- It wasn't me.

534
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,930
It wasn't me!

535
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:04,640
Well, now, look here.
If it wasn't you and it wasn't you...

536
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,410
Alive! It's alive!

537
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:34,040
It's alive!!

538
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,920
Stand back.

539
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:48,430
Hello, there.

540
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,140
I'm going to set you free.

541
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,110
- Is the sedative ready?
- Yes, Doctor.

542
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,620
I want you...

543
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:17,210
..to sit... up.

544
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,440
Stand... on your feet.

545
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,240
You can do it.

546
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:54,750
Now... walk!

547
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,550
Doctor, I'm frightened!

548
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,550
Don't worry.

549
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,260
Good.

550
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,180
Good!

551
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,860
What is it? What's the matter?

552
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:21,860
- Quick! Give him the...

553
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,360
Quick! Give him the...

554
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,650
- What? Give him the what?

555
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,950
Three syllables.
First syllable - sounds like...

556
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,370
Head! Uh, sounds like head!

557
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,870
Bed! Uh... Said...

558
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:36,750
Said!

559
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,370
- Said!
- Said!

560
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,590
Second syllable - little word.

561
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,250
Uh... this, that, the...

562
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,050
A...

563
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:46,670
- Said a...
- Said a...

564
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,260
Dirt word! He said a dirt word!

565
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:52,050
Oh, sounds like...

566
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,270
Uh, to give! Give!

567
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,350
Said... Said a give... Give him a said a give!

568
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:01,060
Oh! Tive... tive... Sedative!

569
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,150
On the nosey!

570
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:25,050
Said a give?!

571
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,310
Oh, Frederick! Are you all right?

572
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,100
Yes!

573
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:42,690
- Would you excuse me for one minute, dear?
- Of course, Doctor.

574
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,400
I-gor...

575
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,200
- May I speak to you for a moment?
- Of course.

576
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,410
- Sit down, won't you?
- Thank you.

577
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:56,700
No, no. Up here.

578
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:59,210
Thank you.

579
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,420
Now... that brain that you gave me...

580
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,090
Was it... Hans Delbruck's?

581
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,600
- No.
- Ah! Good.

582
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,220
Uh... Would you mind telling me...

583
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:24,310
..whose brain... I did put in?

584
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:29,190
- Then you won't be angry?
- I will not... be... angry.

585
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,110
Abby someone.

586
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,990
Abby someone...

587
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,700
- Abby who?
- Abby... Normal.

588
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,710
Abby Normal...

589
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:45,290
I'm almost sure that was the name.

590
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:53,930
Are you saying that I put an abnormal brain...

591
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:58,390
..into a seven-and-a-half-foot long,...

592
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,730
..54-inch wide...

593
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,610
..gorilla?!

594
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,030
Is that what you're telling me?!

595
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,400
Quick, quick! Give him the...

596
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:13,990
What?

597
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,620
- Three syllables, yes!

598
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,160
I wonder who that could be at this hour.

599
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,840
Inga, quick! See who that is.

600
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:34,840
You... put that thing
back on the operating table.

601
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:38,760
And strap him down tightly!

602
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:43,770
- Where are you going?
- To wash up. I've got to look normal.

603
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,270
We've all of us got to behave normally!

604
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,570
Hah! Monsters!

605
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,160
Excellent shot.

606
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:02,750
This is the 20th century, Kemp.
Monsters are passe like ghosts and goblins.

607
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:07,250
Not to the good people
of this village, Herr Doktor.

608
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,460
To them...

609
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,960
..he is a very real thing.

610
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:19,850
Especially when...
there is a Frankenstein residing in this house.

611
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:37,150
Nice grouping.

612
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,240
Thank you.

613
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:47,330
I wouldn't think an intelligent fellow like you
would fall for all this superstitious rot!

614
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:53,250
It is not superstition that worries me,
Herr Doktor, but genes und...

615
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,460
..chromosomes!

616
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:59,550
- Rubbish!
- Hm, well, you might say, but this is...

617
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,760
..Transylvania!

618
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,890
Und you are a...

619
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,480
..Frankenstein!

620
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,480
You, uh... seem unusually upset
by this discussion.

621
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,400
Not in the least.

622
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:20,780
I find it extremely amusing, that's all.

623
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,490
Well... this was fun!

624
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,370
Now, if you don't mind, Inspector,
I'm a little tired.

625
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:29,710
Then...

626
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:33,210
..I may give the villagers
your complete assurance...

627
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,510
..that you have no interest whatsoever
in carrying on your grandfather's work?

628
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,680
May I take that for a yes?

629
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,310
Very well.

630
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:51,400
- You can find the way out by yourself?
- Of course.

631
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:57,110
Until we meet again,... Herr Baron.

632
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,900
Yes. Drop by any time. We are always open.

633
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,080
Dieser verdammte Arm!

634
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:45,070
Oh, Victor!

635
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,410
Victor...

636
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:49,500
We have done it!

637
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:55,420
I'm going to set you free.

638
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:59,050
Would you like that, meine Seuchekopf?

639
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:10,930
They wanted to hurt you!

640
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,020
But I'm going to help you!

641
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:17,730
Thank heavens that's over with.

642
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:20,740
- Frau Blucher!

643
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,240
Stop! Don't come closer!

644
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,330
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to set him free!

645
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:30,540
No! No, you mustn't!

646
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,040
Yes!

647
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,420
Are you insane? He'll kill you!

648
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,750
No, he won't. Not this one.

649
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,050
He is as gentle as a lamb.

650
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:46,720
Stand back! Stand back!
For the love of God, he has a rotten brain!

651
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,720
It's not rotten. It's a good brain!

652
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:51,930
It's rotten, I tell you! Rotten!

653
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,730
Ixnay on the ottenray.

654
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:00,650
I'm not afraid! I know what he likes!

655
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,040
That music!

656
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:23,840
Yes! It's in your blood!
It's in the blood of all Frankensteins!

657
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:28,140
It reaches the soul when words are useless.

658
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:31,850
Your grandfather used to play it
to the creature he was making.

659
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:34,640
- Then it was you all the time!
- Yes!

660
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:37,730
- You played that music in the night.
- Yes!

661
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,690
- To get us into the laboratory.
- Yes!

662
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:44,360
- That was your cigar in the ashtray!
- Yes!

663
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,860
And it was you who left
my grandfather's book out for me to find!

664
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:49,280
Yes!

665
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:51,160
- So that I would...
- Yes!

666
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,490
- Then you and Victor were...
- Yes!

667
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,290
Yes! Say it!

668
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:00,170
He was my boyfriend!

669
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:14,180
You will never catch him now!

670
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:17,560
He's free! Do you hear?

671
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,060
Free!

672
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,160
Gone!

673
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:37,160
Gone!

674
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,670
We've got to find him, do you understand?

675
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:42,670
We've got to find him
before he kills someone!

676
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:45,590
What have I done?

677
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,260
Oh, God in heaven!

678
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,390
What have I done?

679
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:01,270
Oh, I love my pretty little flower

680
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:04,980
Oh, I love my pretty little flower

681
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:08,190
Oh, I love my flower

682
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,660
That monster is loose...

683
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:19,790
Boards must be tight!

684
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:24,630
There.

685
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,300
Thank God you put Helga to bed.

686
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:32,640
With all this monster business,
I take no chances. I remember the last time.

687
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:37,810
But, Papa! I told you that I was turning
the Rostbraten, don't you remember?

688
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,100
I asked you to put Helga to...

689
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:42,100
You...

690
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,400
Now throw a kiss and say bye-bye.

691
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:59,200
Oh, dear. Nothing left.

692
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:02,500
What shall we throw in now?

693
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,510
Maybe she was in the bathroom
when you looked!

694
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:12,930
But I didn't even look upstairs.
I thought you did!

695
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,220
You didn't look upstairs?

696
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,100
Sit down.

697
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:23,600
Sit down!

698
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,440
A visitor is all I ask.

699
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:18,740
A temporary companion to help me
pass a few short hours in my lonely life.

700
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,170
Thank you, Lord. Thank you!

701
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:39,050
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't speak. Don't say a word.

702
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,770
Oh, my joy... and my prize from heaven.

703
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:46,770
Oh, you must have been
the tallest one in your class!

704
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,770
My name is Harold and I live here all alone.

705
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:52,570
- What is your name?

706
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:54,860
- I didn't get that.

707
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,860
Mmm! No...

708
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:58,950
Oh, forgive me.

709
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,950
I didn't realise you were a mute.

710
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,160
You see how heaven plans.

711
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:08,670
Me, a poor blind man,
and you, you... a mute.

712
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,880
An incredibly big mute.

713
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,670
Ahh! But your hand is frozen, my child.

714
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:19,340
- How does a nice bowl of soup sound, huh?

715
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:32,570
Well... I know what it means to...
to be cold and hungry.

716
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:33,860
Yes...

717
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:37,450
And how much it means to have
a little kindness from a stranger.

718
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,360
- Are you ready for your soup?

719
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,240
Hold out your bowl, then.

720
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,660
Oh, my friend, my friend...

721
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:51,380
You don't know what your visit means to me.

722
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:55,050
How long I've waited for the pleasure
of another human being.

723
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:58,880
Sometimes in our preoccupation
with worldly matters,...

724
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,220
..we tend to forget the simple pleasures...

725
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:06,310
- ..that are the basis for true happiness.

726
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,810
Yes, yes, yes. Oh...

727
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,900
And now a little wine with your soup?

728
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:15,320
- Good, good.

729
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:28,120
Huh? Good... Yes...

730
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:34,920
Wait!

731
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:36,590
A toast!

732
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,210
A toast to...

733
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,880
Yes! Long friendship!

734
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,600
- How hungry you must have been.

735
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:52,190
Now... now, now for a little surprise.

736
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,980
For a special occasion, I've been saving...

737
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:02,410
..cigars!

738
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,410
- Take one.

739
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,290
What?

740
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,500
No... no, no.

741
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:15,080
Fire is good.

742
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:18,210
Fire is good, yes. Fire is our friend.

743
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,090
Yes. I - I'll show you. I'll show you.

744
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,680
You see? You see?

745
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,310
You have your cigar?

746
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:36,310
Let me see. Let me see.

747
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,110
All right.

748
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,320
Now, now, now...

749
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:43,240
Just hold it right there. Now...

750
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:47,160
..don't inhale until the tip glows.

751
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,640
Wait!

752
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,220
Wait!

753
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,350
Where are you going?

754
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,940
I was gonna make espresso.

755
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,150
Now!

756
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,740
Quick! Give him the sedative!

757
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,300
He's out!

758
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,100
I know.

759
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,900
I'm going in there.

760
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,190
Bring me that candle.

761
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,080
Love...

762
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,500
..is the only thing
that can save this poor creature.

763
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:00,290
And I am going to convince him
that he is loved...

764
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:04,590
..even at the cost of my own life.

765
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:10,890
No matter what you hear in there,
no matter how cruelly I beg you,...

766
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:14,470
..no matter how terribly I may scream,...

767
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,770
..do not open this door,
or you will undo everything I've worked for.

768
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,600
Do you understand?

769
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:24,770
Do not open this door!

770
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,400
Yes, Doctor.

771
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:30,700
Nice working with you.

772
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:06,070
Let me out. Let me out of here!
Get me the hell out of here!

773
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,570
What's the matter with you people?
I was joking!

774
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,990
Don't you know a joke when you hear one?

775
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:17,830
Jesus Christ! Get me outta here!

776
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,710
Open this goddamn door
or I'll kick your rotten heads in!

777
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,210
Mommy!

778
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,050
Nein!

779
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:37,010
Obviously...

780
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,640
Hello, handsome!

781
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,820
You're a good-looking fellow, you know?

782
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:51,030
People laugh at you.

783
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:54,320
People hate you, but why do they hate you?

784
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:58,240
Because they are jealous!

785
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,620
Look at that boyish face.

786
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,210
Look at that sweet smile.

787
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,420
Do you wanna talk about physical strength?

788
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:14,430
Do you want to talk about sheer muscle?

789
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:19,140
Do you want to talk
about the Olympian ideal?

790
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:21,430
You are a god!

791
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:24,940
And listen to me...

792
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:28,310
You are not evil.

793
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:33,950
You... are... good!

794
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:45,120
This is a nice boy.

795
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,040
This is a good boy.

796
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,050
This is a mother's angel.

797
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:54,420
And I want the world to know,...

798
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,350
..once and for all and without any shame,...

799
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:03,770
..that we love him!

800
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:10,360
I'm going to teach you.

801
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:15,280
I'm gonna show you how to walk,
how to speak, how to move, how to think!

802
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:18,070
Together,...

803
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,160
..you and I...

804
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:26,160
..are going... to make
the greatest single contribution to science...

805
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,880
..since the creation of fire!

806
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:33,960
Dr Fronkonsteen! Are you all right?

807
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:36,050
My name...

808
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:40,180
..is Frankenstein!

809
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:37,280
Distinguished colleagues,
ladies and gentlemen.

810
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:39,570
Tonight it is my great privilege...

811
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:43,870
..of introducing to you a man
whose family name was once both...

812
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,160
..famous...

813
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,500
..and... infamous!

814
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:55,420
And now may I present to you
Doktor Baron Friedrich von Frankenstein!

815
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,390
- My fellow scienti...

816
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:12,520
..tists... and neurosurgeons,
ladies and gentlemen.

817
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,190
A few short weeks ago,
coming from a background,...

818
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:21,400
..believe me, as conservative and traditionally
grounded in scientific fact as any of you,...

819
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:26,490
..I began an experiment in,
incredulous as it may sound,...

820
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:30,410
..the reanimation of dead tissue.

821
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:36,790
What I have to offer you might possibly be...

822
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:41,010
..the gateway to immortality.

823
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:51,890
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present for
your intellectual and philosophical pleasure...

824
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:56,020
..the Creature!

825
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:04,610
Remain in your seats, I beg you.

826
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:07,990
We are not children here. We are scientists.

827
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:11,330
I assure you there is nothing to fear.

828
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:18,710
First... may I offer for your consideration...

829
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:23,420
..a neurological demonstration
of the primary cerebellar functions.

830
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,510
Balance and coordination!

831
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:32,890
Walk... heel to toe.

832
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,240
Backwards!

833
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:09,260
Ladies and gentlemen, you've seen
the Creature perform simple motor activity,...

834
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:11,560
..but for what you will see next...

835
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,350
..we must enter... quietly...
into the realm of genius.

836
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,230
Ladies and gentlemen,...

837
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,240
..mesdames et messieurs,...

838
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,240
..Damen und Herren,...

839
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:30,740
..from what was once
an inarticulate mass of lifeless tissues,...

840
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:34,950
..may I now present
a cultured, sophisticated...

841
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:38,250
..man about town!

842
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:43,050
Hit it!

843
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:50,760
If you're blue
and you don't know where to go to

844
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:52,760
Why don't you go where fashion sits

845
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,350
Puttin' on the Ritz

846
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,280
Nothing! Nothing, I tell you!

847
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,910
Five, six, seven, eight...

848
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:39,410
Come on! Are you trying
to make me look like a fool?

849
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,880
Please! I beg you!

850
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,590
For safety's sake, don't humiliate him!

851
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:55,890
Come back! Do you hear me?
I will not let you destroy my work!

852
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:58,810
As your creator
I command you to come back!

853
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,150
Chained.

854
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,950
Chained like a beast in a cage.

855
01:23:58,030 --> 01:24:00,450
Oh, Doctor... I feel so terrible.

856
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:02,620
There's only one answer.

857
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:07,330
If I could find a way to equalise
the imbalance in his cerebral-spinal fluid,...

858
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:10,340
..why, he'd be as right as rain.

859
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:12,710
But how?

860
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:15,130
How, before it's too late?

861
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:18,050
Oh, Frederick...

862
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:20,350
If only there was some way I could...

863
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:24,020
..relieve this torture you are going through.

864
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:28,350
If there was some way I could help to...

865
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:32,730
..relieve the tension. If there was just...

866
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:35,740
..some way I could give you a little peace.

867
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:45,750
Doctor, I have...

868
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:47,750
Doctor?

869
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:50,840
What is it?

870
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,170
Doctor...

871
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,590
Where are you?

872
01:25:10,770 --> 01:25:14,280
I'm sorry, Doctor.
This cable came while you were gone.

873
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:19,160
I thought I told you never to
interrupt me while I'm working!

874
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:24,290
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I thought this was an emergency.

875
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:28,290
You see, your fiancee
will be arriving any second!

876
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,960
What?! Elizabeth here tonight?

877
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:34,460
Yes. I will go prepare a room at once.

878
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:38,260
I suggest you put on a tie!

879
01:25:58,690 --> 01:25:59,700
Darling.

880
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:02,990
Darling!

881
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,490
- Surprised?
- Surprised.

882
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,660
- Love me?
- Love you?

883
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:09,660
Well...

884
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:13,170
- Let's turn in.
- Darling!

885
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:17,760
It's been a long day. I'm sure you're very tired.
I'll just pay the driver.

886
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:19,380
Darling!

887
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,470
What?

888
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:24,470
- Surprised?
- I, uh... Yes.

889
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,680
- Love me?
- Well...

890
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:29,060
- Well... Let's turn in.
- Ohh!

891
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:30,770
- Darling!
- Yes!

892
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:32,560
Say nothing, act casual.

893
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:35,360
- Ready?
- Yes... l think...

894
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:37,820
Yes.

895
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:40,030
I am a bit tired after all.

896
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,200
I'd like you to meet
my assistants, Inga and I-gor.

897
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:47,540
How do you do?

898
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:49,540
How do you do?

899
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:53,420
- Uh... This is my financier Elizabeth.
- I'm so happy to meet you at last.

900
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:54,710
Uh... Financee.

901
01:26:54,710 --> 01:27:00,130
Excuse me, darling.
What is it exactly that you... do do?

902
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:07,100
Uh, well, I assist Dr Fronkonsteen
in the laboratory.

903
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:10,020
We have intellectual discussions und we...

904
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:12,520
As a matter of fact, we were just having one...

905
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:14,020
- May I...?
- What?

906
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,730
Wait a minute, wait a minute...

907
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,520
Uh... I-gor, would you
give me a hand with the bags?

908
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:22,110
Certainly, you take the blonde
and I'll take the one in the turban.

909
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:30,620
Stop that! I'm talking about the luggage.

910
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:32,410
Yes, master.

911
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,120
Ladies, this way.

912
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:38,000
It'll be a long night.

913
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:41,510
- If you need any help with the girls...
- Get in there!

914
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:49,100
You settle down now.

915
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:53,020
Cos... we gonna be pals.

916
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:58,020
- Right?

917
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:00,730
Nice and cosy.

918
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:03,820
Just like old friends.

919
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,120
- What's the matter?

920
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:17,000
- You're afraid of this little fire?

921
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:19,000
This can't hurt you.

922
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:21,210
- See?

923
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:24,340
Oh, some monster you are.

924
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:26,680
See, Mama was right.

925
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:30,180
Little boys ain't supposed to play with fire.

926
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:34,060
Is they? Cos they might get hurt!

927
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,750
Halt!

928
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:05,670
Up.

929
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,340
A riot is an ugly thing!

930
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:13,470
Und I think that it is just about time
that we had one!

931
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:17,560
Kill the monster!

932
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:20,270
As heaven is my witness... Up.

933
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:24,780
..he will curse the day...

934
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:28,740
..that he was burn a Frankenstein!

935
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:30,740
What?

936
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:35,660
I said "He will curse the day
that he was born a Frankenstein!"

937
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:38,370
Yeah!

938
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:52,850
Loose?!

939
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:54,350
Loose?!

940
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:57,980
He's broken loose!
Do you know what that means?

941
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:01,650
Darling, you mustn't worry so.

942
01:30:04,270 --> 01:30:06,150
I suppose you're right.

943
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,150
Of course I am.

944
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,400
Now come along like a good boy.

945
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:12,780
What would I do without you?

946
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:17,500
Is your room just down the hall
in case I get the frights during the night?

947
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:22,920
Well, yes, but I thought perhaps tonight,
under the circumstances, I might...

948
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:25,090
..stay here with you.

949
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,880
Would you want me like this now?

950
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:32,220
So soon before our wedding,
so near we can almost touch it?

951
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:37,390
- Yes!
- Whoa, boy!

952
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:46,110
..to wait just a little while longer when
I can give myself to you without hesitation,...

953
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:50,320
..when I can be totally
and unashamedly and legally yours?

954
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:56,490
That's a tough choice.

955
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:59,410
You're a tough guy.

956
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:04,000
I suppose you're right.

957
01:31:04,210 --> 01:31:06,210
Of course I am. I always am.

958
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:09,590
Now give me a kiss and say good night.

959
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:15,090
No tongues.

960
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:23,690
Good night, darling.

961
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:27,190
- Good night, sweetheart.

962
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,610
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

963
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:31,490
- You love me?

964
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:33,700
- l love you, honey.

965
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:36,200
- Sweet dreams, darling.
- Sweet dreams.

966
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:39,490
- Good night, don't let the bedbugs bite.

967
01:32:57,150 --> 01:32:59,160
Where am I?

968
01:33:00,030 --> 01:33:03,950
Who are you?
W-What... What are you?

969
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:06,960
- What... What are you going to do to me?

970
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:09,830
Calm down.

971
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,340
I'm not afraid of you.
How much do you want?

972
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:15,920
My father is very rich.
You would have the world at your fingertips.

973
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:21,430
Listen. I have to be back by 11.30.
I'm expecting a very important call.

974
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:25,560
Speak! Speak! Why don't you speak?

975
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:27,730
What are you doing?

976
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:30,150
Oh, no, you can't be serious!

977
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,530
I'm af... I...

978
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,240
Oh, my God!

979
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:38,450
Woof!

980
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:43,580
I-I'm engaged.

981
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:46,370
And once he... But I didn't... It was never...

982
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:38,380
Penny for your thoughts.

983
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:43,300
You're incorrigible, aren't you?

984
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:46,470
You little zipper-neck!

985
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,600
Oh, all right.

986
01:34:51,690 --> 01:34:54,270
Seven has always been my... lucky number.

987
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:58,480
Come over here, you hot monster!

988
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,570
- What is it?

989
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:05,780
What's the matter?

990
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:08,080
Is it that music?

991
01:35:08,290 --> 01:35:12,000
It's probably from some nearby cottage.
Nothing to worry about.

992
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:14,290
Where are you going? Where...

993
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:16,500
You men are all alike!

994
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:19,590
Seven or eight quick ones
and you're off with the boys.

995
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:22,970
To boast and brag!
You better keep your mouth shut!

996
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:25,970
Oh, I think I love him...

997
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,940
He's coming back! Oh, look! The music...

998
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:19,610
Oh! Keep playing! It's the music!

999
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:22,740
It's the music that's bringing him back!

1000
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:27,240
Come on! Come on!

1001
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:37,040
Come on, come on!

1002
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:43,710
Oh, come on! You can do it!

1003
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:52,810
Come on! You can do it!

1004
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,940
Don't touch him!
He wants to do it by himself!

1005
01:37:03,820 --> 01:37:06,740
You can do it! You can do it!

1006
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:10,030
Please, my creation!

1007
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,590
Quick! Catch him!

1008
01:37:27,470 --> 01:37:30,890
Have all the preparations
been made for the transference?

1009
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:32,560
Yes, Doctor.

1010
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:35,180
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

1011
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:37,770
It's the only thing that can save him now.

1012
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,480
You realise you're risking... both your lives?

1013
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:45,990
Yes.

1014
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:00,750
Switching off!

1015
01:38:20,690 --> 01:38:22,860
How... how will I know when they are done?

1016
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:25,360
The doctor said to allow 15 minutes.

1017
01:38:26,070 --> 01:38:28,150
Not one second more...

1018
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:30,150
..or less.

1019
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:40,370
How long now?

1020
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:42,170
Two more minutes.

1021
01:39:04,690 --> 01:39:06,690
- What's that noise?
- I don't know.

1022
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:09,110
- What time is it?
- Almost time.

1023
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:15,830
Oh, my God! It's the villagers!

1024
01:39:18,910 --> 01:39:21,120
No! No! Please!

1025
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:23,500
Just another seven seconds!

1026
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:28,800
No! No!!

1027
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:32,510
No! No! No!

1028
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,720
- Put that man down!
- It's the monster!

1029
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,390
- No, it can't be.
- It is.

1030
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:40,600
I said "Put that man down!"

1031
01:39:50,030 --> 01:39:52,530
Und just who do you think you are...

1032
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:54,990
..that you order these people about?

1033
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:57,830
I am the monster!

1034
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:02,120
Ja. I see that you are the monster.

1035
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:04,920
For as long as I can remember...

1036
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:07,630
..people have hated me.

1037
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:10,510
They looked at my face and my body...

1038
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:13,590
..and they ran away in horror.

1039
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:19,310
In my loneliness, I decided that if I could not
inspire love, which was my deepest hope,...

1040
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,810
..I would instead cause fear!

1041
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:27,020
I live...

1042
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:33,400
..because this poor, half-crazed genius
has given me life.

1043
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:36,110
He alone held an image of me...

1044
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,320
..as something beautiful.

1045
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,910
And then,...

1046
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:44,790
..when it would have been easy enough
to stay out of danger,...

1047
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:48,420
..he used his own body as a guinea pig...

1048
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:50,670
..to give me a calmer brain...

1049
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:58,340
..and a... somewhat more... sophisticated way
of expressing myself.

1050
01:40:59,850 --> 01:41:03,560
Well, this is, of course,
an entirely different situation.

1051
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:06,560
As the leader of this community,...

1052
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:10,730
..may I be the first to offer you my hand...

1053
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:13,570
..in friendship.

1054
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:22,030
- Thank you.
- You are entirely welcome.

1055
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:26,960
Und now let us all go to my house
for a little sponge cake und a little wine...

1056
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:30,330
..und... Shit!

1057
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,960
To the lumberyard!

1058
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:01,450
Hello, Mrs Frankenstein.

1059
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:05,370
Mrs Frankenstein! What a beautiful name!

1060
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:07,160
Oh, darling!

1061
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,330
Hold on to your hat.

1062
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:11,830
What?

1063
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,840
I'll be right back.

1064
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:31,650
I'm holding on to it, darling!

1065
01:42:32,690 --> 01:42:34,900
Just a few more seconds!

1066
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:19,400
Honey! Honey, I hope you didn't find
Daddy's little part too boring.

1067
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:22,990
I mean, he did it just for you
and he meant so well. Say you liked it.

1068
01:43:24,410 --> 01:43:26,410
Honey, did you see?

1069
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:30,000
I put a special hamper in the bathroom
just for your shirts...

1070
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:33,370
..and the other one is just for socks
and poo-poo undies.

1071
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:35,080
Here I come!

1072
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,280
The feeling is mutual.

1073
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:11,080
You know, it's a puzzlement.

1074
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:15,500
There's something I've always wanted
to ask you about that operation.

1075
01:44:15,790 --> 01:44:17,880
You know in the transference part...

1076
01:44:18,130 --> 01:44:23,340
The monster got part of your wonderful brain,
but what did you ever get from him?
