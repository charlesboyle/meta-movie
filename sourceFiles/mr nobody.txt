1
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:30,870
Like most living creatures,

2
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:35,462
the pigeon quickly associates the 
pressing of a lever with reward.

3
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:40,584
But when a timer releases the seal
automatically every 20 seconds,

4
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:42,115
the pigeon wonders,

5
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:45,346
"What did I do to deserve this?"

6
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:49,344
If it was flapping
its wings at the time,

7
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,673
it will continue to flap
convinced that its actions ...

8
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,913
have a decisive influence
on what happens.

9
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:59,727
We call this
"pigeon superstition."

10
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:14,873
What did I do to deserve this?

11
00:04:29,195 --> 00:04:32,138
How's it been going
since the last time?

12
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:42,521
- Do I know you?
- We see each other every week.

13
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:46,114
I'm Dr. Feldheim.

14
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:50,744
- And who are you?
- Nobody.

15
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,834
Nemo Nobody.

16
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:56,138
That's an unusual name,
don't you think?

17
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:59,871
Sometimes, people call me Mr. Craft.

18
00:04:59,906 --> 00:05:01,048
Who?

19
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,167
C-R-A-F-T.

20
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:09,824
Can't Remember A Fucking Thing.

21
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:18,907
What was the first question
I asked you?

22
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:24,485
- I don't know.
- Can you tell me how old you are?

23
00:05:25,615 --> 00:05:28,087
I'm 34.

24
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:32,643
I was born in 1975.

25
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:35,586
Would you mind
looking at your hands?

26
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,091
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

27
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:44,416
There's a mirror in front of you.

28
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:49,723
No. I ...

29
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:51,921
What year is this?

30
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:55,104
2009.

31
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:58,318
I'm 34.

32
00:05:59,102 --> 00:06:04,411
I was born February 9th, 1975.

33
00:06:05,057 --> 00:06:10,098
So I guess, it must be
your birthday.

34
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:23,259
I'm 34.

35
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:27,623
I'm 34!

36
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:32,111
I've got to wake up!

37
00:06:32,944 --> 00:06:35,298
I've got to wake up!

38
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:57,609
Don't, Nemo.
Sun hurts my eyes.

39
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:50,636
Hey, buddy.

40
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:56,087
Good morning, my little angels.

41
00:07:56,681 --> 00:07:59,742
- Time for school, okay?
- Hmm.

42
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:01,271
Come on.

43
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:04,210
Elise, I'm gonna
take the kids to school.

44
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,108
- Paul, keep it down.
- My name's not Paul.

45
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:32,589
Paul?

46
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,696
Daddy ...

47
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:39,062
Daddy ...

48
00:08:41,185 --> 00:08:42,481
Daddy ...

49
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,242
Paul, don't wake your father.

50
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:50,128
Elise.

51
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:52,884
It's me, Jean.

52
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:58,260
- Am I dead?
- Go back and play Paul.

53
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:03,871
- Who's Elise?
- I don't know anyone called Elise.

54
00:09:04,755 --> 00:09:07,421
You're so tired, Nemo.
You need to rest.

55
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:09,217
I'll turn the television
on for you.

56
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:11,101
I'm going inside ...

57
00:09:11,397 --> 00:09:14,340
- The sun hurts my eyes.
- What?

58
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:17,937
The sun hurts my eyes.

59
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:33,461
Nemo, your friends are here.

60
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:48,840
Hello, Nemo.

61
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,344
How are you feeling today?

62
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:58,323
Do you know who I am?

63
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:05,027
We're all very worried 
about you, Nemo.

64
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:09,577
Everyone wants you be 
back in the office soon.

65
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:31,742
Mrs. Nobody.

66
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:57,295
This is Julian Marshall.

67
00:10:57,476 --> 00:10:59,476
Live from New New York hospital,

68
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:04,447
where we're going to see the final 
episode in our series, "The Last Mortals".

69
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:11,011
Mr. Nobody is 117 years old
and he has not been telemorized!

70
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:16,025
Nor does he have one of these
marvelous stem-cell compatible pigs.

71
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:20,491
Live on WWB,

72
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:25,982
Mr. Nobody will be the last man
on Earth to die of old-age.

73
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:29,663
- Mr. Nobody ...
- The Last Mortal.

74
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,185
The last mortal.

75
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:50,311
Now, Doctor,

76
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:53,591
no trace of his identity has been
found on the National Records.

77
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,435
Nothing about his past.

78
00:11:56,436 --> 00:11:58,608
We do not know
who Mr. Nobody is.

79
00:11:58,643 --> 00:11:59,955
Neither does he.

80
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,309
Our patient's memories
are confused,

81
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:05,776
but it is not unusual at his 
certain stage of illness ...

82
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:09,443
for very old memories
to re-emerge in great detail.

83
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,049
Let's try something new.

84
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:16,725
I'm thinking
of an old technique.

85
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,962
I can't promise anything.

86
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:22,442
Maybe snatches of memory
will come back.

87
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:24,753
Maybe nothing will happen.

88
00:12:25,934 --> 00:12:27,935
Are you willing to try?

89
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:38,593
You are very relaxed.

90
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:43,074
You hear only my voice.

91
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:47,407
Your eyelids are getting heavy.

92
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:51,789
Your arms and legs
are getting heavy.

93
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:55,454
I'm going to count to three.

94
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,711
When I say three ...

95
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:02,954
you will be asleep.

96
00:13:03,828 --> 00:13:04,535
One.

97
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:08,436
Two.

98
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:14,547
Remember the day you came here.

99
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:21,277
Three.

100
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:23,724
You're sleeping.

101
00:14:07,523 --> 00:14:11,172
Remember even further back.

102
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,401
When I say three ...

103
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:14,942
One ...

104
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:17,689
Two ...

105
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:20,296
Three.

106
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:23,247
Remember.

107
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:32,025
I can remember a long time ago ...

108
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:33,908
Long before my birth.

109
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:42,741
I was whizzing with those
who were not yet born.

110
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:50,563
When we're not born yet,
we know everything.

111
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,683
Everything that's will happen.

112
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:23,867
When it's your time,

113
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:27,399
the angels of Oblivion
place a finger on your mouth.

114
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,679
Shh.

115
00:15:29,556 --> 00:15:31,675
It leaves a mark on the upper lip.

116
00:15:33,288 --> 00:15:36,231
It means that you have 
forgotten everything.

117
00:15:38,032 --> 00:15:40,622
But the angels missed me.

118
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:52,450
Then you have to find
a daddy and a mummy.

119
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:54,492
It's not easy to choose.

120
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:57,869
Blond and blue eyed.
It's all I'm asking.

121
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:58,884
Andrew!

122
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:01,042
It would be nice to the little 
one not to be all alone.

123
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:02,245
You stay here.

124
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,305
It's normal to think about babies
when you reach a certain age.

125
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:06,718
Well, for women at least.

126
00:16:06,753 --> 00:16:10,291
- It's the meaning of life ... │- Of life. 
I had not finished yet, darling.

127
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:11,671
It's the meaning of life.

128
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:13,907
It's not that we want a kid.

129
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:16,185
But we slept together.

130
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:19,308
- It's an important experience.
- It's an important experience, yeah.

131
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,888
I think it would help my husband
if we had a child.

132
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:25,759
We'd call him George.
Right, George?

133
00:16:26,143 --> 00:16:28,262
We had a dog, but he died.

134
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:49,336
In the end, I chose them
because the lady smelled nice ...

135
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:50,627
and the man said ...

136
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:52,865
Well, I can tell you how we met.

137
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,798
It was meant to be. Have you 
heard of the Butterfly Effect?

138
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:59,299
Once upon a time, there 
was a daddy and a mommy ...

139
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,457
named "The Daddy" and "The Mommy".

140
00:18:02,492 --> 00:18:04,222
They found a cute little baby ...

141
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:07,533
and called it
"The Cute Little Baby".

142
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:09,905
The little baby was born there.

143
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,645
He was born that day,
and not another.

144
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,530
His daddy and his mummy
live at number seven.

145
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:19,555
Everything you see exists.

146
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,387
We can see it.

147
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:27,023
I can see Mummy's eyes.
But I can't see my eyes.

148
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:33,263
The little baby can see his hands,
but he can not see himself.

149
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:36,513
So, does he really exist?

150
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:38,457
Do I really exist?

151
00:18:39,502 --> 00:18:40,326
Boo.

152
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:45,538
Boo.

She smells good.

161
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,823
The Daddy has a watch
and hair in his arm.

162
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:24,369
The watch goes "tick-tock".

163
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:28,649
If the baby falls, the 
mother claps her hands.

164
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,737
She says, "Bravo."

165
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:31,738
Bravo.

166
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:45,152
Why am I me, and not someone else?

167
00:19:56,109 --> 00:20:00,553
And so, high fresher fronts
moving in tomorrow.

168
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:03,193
It will bring clear skies
for the whole weekend.

169
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:06,019
So, get those barbecues out.

170
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:20,248
Hello.

171
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,903
Why do we remember the past,
but not the future?

172
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:28,847
When you ask Mummy, she says,

173
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:30,893
- "Stop asking why."
- Stop asking why.

174
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:33,281
- "It's complicated."
- It's complicated.

175
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:43,576
Yes.

176
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:55,980
It's okay, I'm--I'm a journalist.

177
00:20:57,449 --> 00:21:02,629
The hospital won't allow interviews.
I just like to ask you a few questions.

178
00:21:04,754 --> 00:21:08,051
A friend of mine's a nurse 
here. She helped me get in.

179
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:10,637
What time is it?

180
00:21:11,944 --> 00:21:13,121
14:12.

181
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:17,239
Where did you get that?

182
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,983
I borrowed it from the 
University Museum.

183
00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:22,231
But it still works.

184
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,497
I've got nothing
to say to you.

185
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:28,517
- I'm ...
- I'm Mr. Nobody.

186
00:21:28,518 --> 00:21:30,835
The man who doesn't exist.

187
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:36,002
Do you remember what the world was 
like before quasi-immortality?

188
00:21:36,265 --> 00:21:38,973
- What?
- Telemorization.

189
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:41,689
Endless renewal of cells.

190
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:46,368
What was it like
when humans were mortal?

191
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,647
There were cars that polluted.

192
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:56,557
We smoked cigarettes.
We ate meat.

193
00:21:56,853 --> 00:22:02,504
We did everything we can do in 
this dump and it was wonderful.

194
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:07,850
Most of the time,
nothing happened ...

195
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:11,516
like a French movie.

196
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:17,447
And sexually?
Before sex became obsolete?

197
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:22,636
We screwed!

198
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,181
Everybody was always screwing.

199
00:22:30,052 --> 00:22:31,936
We fell in love.

200
00:22:33,464 --> 00:22:35,818
We fell in love.

201
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:44,203
What time is it?

202
00:22:46,764 --> 00:22:49,338
What was there 
before the Big Bang?

203
00:22:49,373 --> 00:22:50,633
Well, you see,

204
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:54,076
there was no before because
before the Big Bang,

205
00:22:54,147 --> 00:22:56,186
Time did not exist ...

206
00:22:56,221 --> 00:23:00,831
Time is a result of the 
expansion of Universe itself,

207
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:04,275
but what will happen when the 
Universe has finished expanding ...

208
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,843
and the movement is reversed?

209
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:07,833
What will be the nature of time?

210
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,835
If String Theory is correct,

211
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,640
the Universe possesses
nine spatial dimensions,

212
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,641
and one temporal dimension.

213
00:23:15,702 --> 00:23:18,380
Now we can imagine that
in the beginning,

214
00:23:18,415 --> 00:23:20,889
all the dimensions
were twisted together ...

215
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:23,244
and during the Big Bang,
three spatial dimensions,

216
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:26,049
the ones that we know as
height, width and depth,

217
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:30,413
and one temporal dimension, what 
we know as time, were deployed.

218
00:23:30,448 --> 00:23:34,415
The other six remained 
miniscule, wound up together.

219
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:38,382
Now, if we live in a Universe
of wound dimensions,

220
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,090
how do we distinguish between ...

221
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:43,616
illusion and reality?

222
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:47,829
Time, as we know it, is
a dimension we experience ...

223
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:49,968
only in one direction.

224
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,710
But what if one of the additional
dimensions wasn't spatial,

225
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:55,269
but temporal?

226
00:23:56,108 --> 00:23:59,640
If you mix the mashed 
potatoes and sauce,

227
00:23:59,722 --> 00:24:04,313
you can't separate 
them later. It's forever.

228
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:07,044
The smoke comes out
of Daddy's cigarette,

229
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,398
but it never goes back in.

230
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,839
We cannot go back.

231
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:19,769
That's why it's hard to choose.

232
00:24:22,665 --> 00:24:25,726
You have to make the right choice.

233
00:24:29,516 --> 00:24:35,520
As long as you don't choose,
everything remains possible.

234
00:24:44,336 --> 00:24:46,808
- Hello, Nemo.
- Hello, Anna.

235
00:24:46,827 --> 00:24:50,091
- Hi, Nemo.
- Hello, Elise.

236
00:24:50,126 --> 00:24:51,355
- Hello, Nemo.
- Hello, Jean.

237
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:00,250
For as much as Anna and Nemo have 
consented together in holy wedlock,

238
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:03,751
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company.

239
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:08,459
For as much as Elise and Nemo have
consented together in holy wedlock ...

240
00:25:08,494 --> 00:25:12,815
Jean and Nemo have 
joined themselves ...

241
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:17,243
I pronounce that they be
husband and wife together ...

242
00:25:18,328 --> 00:25:22,802
Those who God has joined 
together, no one can separate ...

243
00:25:43,158 --> 00:25:47,412
Daddy says you can predict exactly
when Mars will be in the sky,

244
00:25:47,897 --> 00:25:49,753
even in 100 years.

245
00:25:49,754 --> 00:25:51,487
But the funny thing is,

246
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,964
that daddy does not know
what will happen to him ...

247
00:25:53,965 --> 00:25:55,586
two minutes from now.

248
00:26:59,131 --> 00:27:00,131
Mama!

249
00:27:28,836 --> 00:27:31,212
That's not possible, 
no one knows the future.

250
00:27:31,281 --> 00:27:33,096
That's I, I remember it.

251
00:27:33,097 --> 00:27:35,192
You remember the past, 
not the future.

252
00:27:35,193 --> 00:27:36,844
Believe me. I can.

253
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:40,904
Sometimes things happen and I'm feeling
that they have already happened before.

254
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:47,039
Well, that's déjà vu.

255
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:50,372
It happens to everyone 
from time to time.

256
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:53,012
No! It's because of the 
Angels of Oblivion!

257
00:27:53,013 --> 00:27:55,442
They did not put 
their finger on me!

258
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:04,162
Come on!

259
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:08,555
Get it! Grab on!

260
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,882
One, two ...

261
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:53,705
Should Mr. Nobody be allowed
to die a natural death?

262
00:30:53,706 --> 00:30:58,774
Should his existence be artificially
prolonged? Make your vote now!

263
00:30:59,211 --> 00:31:01,523
Press X for artificial prolongation,

264
00:31:01,524 --> 00:31:05,306
press 0 to let nature 
run its course.

265
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:07,564
We'll be back after this!

266
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,420
You too can take a valley
vocation on Mars.

267
00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:13,478
Book before the Union
and save 16,000 inits.

268
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:30,679
Okay, Anna, let's go.

269
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:48,506
Then, the Daddy and the Mummy
kissed all day long.

270
00:33:12,579 --> 00:33:15,404
So, Nemo, have you
made up your mind?

271
00:33:16,592 --> 00:33:21,654
Do you want to come with me? Or do 
you want to stay with your father?

272
00:34:33,844 --> 00:34:35,493
Nemo!

273
00:35:46,948 --> 00:35:49,302
I'm sorry, I ― I don't understand.

274
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,370
Did you stay with your father
or go with your mother?

275
00:36:03,072 --> 00:36:08,369
- Daddy, is it my fault?
- Of course not.

276
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:10,556
It's my fault.

277
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:23,497
I can give you a good deal
on this type of shoe lace.

278
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:29,849
A very good deal.

279
00:36:49,425 --> 00:36:50,956
Remember.

280
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:09,039
Remember.

281
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:14,675
Nemo ...

282
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:16,265
Nemo.

283
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,104
It's time to wake up, darling.

284
00:37:38,063 --> 00:37:41,023
And guess what? You're going 
to be late for school.

285
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:56,583
Nemo, it's me.

286
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,665
I bet you haven't done
your homework.

287
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:04,433
Hurry up and finish.

288
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:07,561
I invited someone for dinner.

289
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:10,818
I'm counting on you
to keep your mouth shut!

290
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:19,356
- How was the trip?
- Uh, it was good.

291
00:38:19,523 --> 00:38:23,997
- Have you seen some nice apartments?
- I did. I've seen a couple of nice ones.

292
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,614
Nemo, don't stare
at people like that.

293
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,388
It's okay. It's not a problem.

294
00:38:30,423 --> 00:38:33,057
He has a gift for making people
uncomfortable.

295
00:38:33,092 --> 00:38:34,234
It's nothing.

296
00:38:35,484 --> 00:38:37,367
It will happen on a Saturday ...

297
00:38:38,678 --> 00:38:40,796
You will be behind
the wheel of your car ...

298
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,420
You are whistling ...

299
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:49,271
You do not see the crossroads ...

300
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:54,768
All of a sudden, a train 
will appear from your left.

301
00:38:55,118 --> 00:38:57,119
And you will be crushed.

302
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:10,602
You're not funny.

303
00:39:11,189 --> 00:39:14,133
Nemo thinks he can 
predict the future.

304
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:19,212
I can. I predicted Dad's accident.

305
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:22,221
Yeah, I always wondered if you're not
the one who took off the handbrake.

306
00:39:22,356 --> 00:39:26,221
No one can predict the future, no 
one knows what's going to happen.

307
00:39:26,747 --> 00:39:28,159
I do.

308
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:32,234
Well if you could, you'd know
you were going to get that.

309
00:39:33,253 --> 00:39:35,018
I knew you'd say that.

310
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,703
Proud of yourself?

311
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:54,170
Why you systematically 
ruin everything I ...

312
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:57,393
Do you think I have 
a right to live too?

313
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:10,921
You could've stayed with your
father if you wanted to.

314
00:40:19,035 --> 00:40:20,706
Everyone, please.

315
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:24,069
I would like to introduce you
a new student in our class.

316
00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:25,685
Her name is Anna.

317
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,215
Please Anna, take a seat.

318
00:40:27,673 --> 00:40:30,695
Alright, let's turn to page 215.

319
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,491
It's last night's reading.

320
00:40:32,526 --> 00:40:35,543
We're going to talk about
climate and vegetation zones ...

321
00:40:35,578 --> 00:40:39,231
and the elements of weather that 
are involved in each of both zones.

322
00:40:39,266 --> 00:40:43,210
There are five elements that
make up weather as we know it.

323
00:40:43,245 --> 00:40:44,622
Atmosphere pressure ...

324
00:41:01,597 --> 00:41:02,420
You're going to swim?

325
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,605
- Come on, the water's nice.
- No, I ...

326
00:41:08,907 --> 00:41:11,498
Come swim with us.
They're my friends, c'mon.

327
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:13,864
They're idiots.

328
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:17,085
And I don't go
swimming with idiots.

329
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,056
Jerk.

330
00:41:32,111 --> 00:41:37,292
What on Earth made me say,
"I don't go swimming with idiots"?

331
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,402
Anna.

332
00:41:51,896 --> 00:41:52,838
Nemo.

333
00:41:53,373 --> 00:41:54,433
Yeah.

334
00:41:55,691 --> 00:41:56,986
How have you been?

335
00:41:58,019 --> 00:41:59,079
I'm fine.

336
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:00,465
How are you?

337
00:42:01,379 --> 00:42:03,145
Yeah, good.

338
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:05,372
Are these your kids?

339
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:07,074
Yeah.

340
00:42:14,144 --> 00:42:16,734
Well, I'll see you around.

341
00:42:18,323 --> 00:42:19,264
Yeah, uh ...

342
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:21,598
I'll see you around.

343
00:42:33,068 --> 00:42:38,248
What on Earth made me say,
"I don't go swimming with idiots"?

344
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,597
You're going to swim?

345
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,996
- Come on, the water's nice.
- No, I ...

346
00:43:15,692 --> 00:43:17,576
I don't know how to swim.

347
00:43:17,808 --> 00:43:18,868
Sorry?

348
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,149
I don't know how to swim.

349
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,021
That's it.

350
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,211
Please don't tell anyone.

351
00:43:30,465 --> 00:43:31,761
Hey, aren't you gonna swim?

352
00:43:32,738 --> 00:43:35,917
No, I've got my period.
I'm gonna stay here.

353
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:37,923
Nemo will keep me company.

354
00:43:37,924 --> 00:43:38,385
Okay.

355
00:44:08,297 --> 00:44:13,006
Darling? I ... I want to
introduce you to someone.

356
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,662
- You've already met Harry.
- Hey.

357
00:44:15,663 --> 00:44:20,413
And this is his daughter, Anna.
Anna, this is Nemo.

358
00:44:30,886 --> 00:44:33,005
Why don't you shake hands?

359
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,194
How was work today?

360
00:45:14,077 --> 00:45:16,785
Ugh, I can't believe them.

361
00:45:16,786 --> 00:45:19,141
Soon as I wonder
how old they are.

362
00:45:23,006 --> 00:45:25,008
They already slept together?

363
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:26,566
I don't know.

364
00:45:27,798 --> 00:45:28,938
I hope they use condoms.

365
00:45:28,973 --> 00:45:32,117
I do not want to end up
with a little brother.

366
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:35,268
I'd rather die.

367
00:45:35,352 --> 00:45:36,883
Is you mom on the pill?

368
00:45:38,292 --> 00:45:39,469
I have no idea.

369
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:43,444
We should slip it
into her morning coffee.

370
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,089
It's like her hormones
have gone to her head.

371
00:45:52,136 --> 00:45:54,255
Sometimes I can see the future.

372
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,508
It doesn't seem like it can be much 
fun knowing what's going to happen.

373
00:46:21,977 --> 00:46:24,331
You're still here.

374
00:46:25,964 --> 00:46:28,790
Did I fall asleep?

375
00:46:30,408 --> 00:46:33,821
Sometimes I don't sleep.

376
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:36,860
So I think ...

377
00:46:39,249 --> 00:46:42,192
I think about how it was.

378
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:47,257
It's all I have left.

379
00:46:50,985 --> 00:46:54,164
What do you see
when you look at me?

380
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,713
A grumpy old man who 
never answers questions?

381
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:00,950
Who mixes everything up?

382
00:47:01,932 --> 00:47:06,996
Who is kept busy
by getting his meals?

383
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,074
Now that's not me ...

384
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:15,542
Me ...

385
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:20,258
I wear shorts.

386
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:25,481
I'm nine years old.

387
00:47:27,032 --> 00:47:30,564
I can run faster than the train.

388
00:47:33,124 --> 00:47:37,009
I can't feel my 
aching back anymore.

389
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,857
I'm 15.

390
00:47:43,651 --> 00:47:45,769
I'm 15.

391
00:47:47,558 --> 00:47:49,677
And I'm in love.

392
00:47:52,546 --> 00:47:54,429
I'm in love.

393
00:49:17,316 --> 00:49:18,141
Nemo?

394
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,815
Nemo?

395
00:49:24,221 --> 00:49:25,399
Nemo?

396
00:49:32,009 --> 00:49:33,892
Isn't he sleeping in the study?

397
00:49:34,374 --> 00:49:36,728
No, I just looked
and he isn't there.

398
00:49:37,385 --> 00:49:40,563
- Anna, have you seen your brother?
- He's not my brother.

399
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:53,448
Oh, there you are.
Sleep alright?

400
00:50:18,398 --> 00:50:20,753
- Who's that?
- It's me.

401
00:50:22,929 --> 00:50:23,989
It's me, Dad ...

402
00:50:24,405 --> 00:50:25,347
Nemo.

403
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,379
Your son.

404
00:50:28,133 --> 00:50:29,899
Of course, son.

405
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:33,707
- Where were you?
- At the shop, Dad.

406
00:50:34,503 --> 00:50:36,269
I always work at the 
shop after school.

407
00:50:36,339 --> 00:50:40,814
You know, a boy your age
should get out more.

408
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:44,093
You can leave me alone, 
you know. I-I can manage.

409
00:50:44,128 --> 00:50:45,741
It's no problem, Dad.

410
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,116
I like being at home.

411
00:51:17,843 --> 00:51:20,316
There was a card from 
your mother in the post.

412
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:25,781
- You have not read it.
- I know. I'll read it later.

413
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,776
Won't you go and see her one day?

414
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,993
I haven't seen her in seven years.

415
00:51:31,164 --> 00:51:33,990
If she ever wanted to see me,
she'd know where to find me.

416
00:51:37,688 --> 00:51:39,691
I've got everything I need, Dad.

417
00:51:40,277 --> 00:51:41,808
Everything's fine.

418
00:52:16,378 --> 00:52:18,497
After three months,

419
00:52:18,776 --> 00:52:21,013
and six days of travel ...

420
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:26,105
the shuttle was heading ...

421
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:31,712
directly toward
the Cancer nebula ...

422
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:35,764
in line with Uranus ...

423
00:52:37,479 --> 00:52:39,363
and its five moons.

424
00:53:00,402 --> 00:53:03,463
It was finally approaching
Mars and the Colonies.

425
00:53:08,933 --> 00:53:10,346
Onboard ...

426
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:14,989
the computer was monitoring the 
passengers' artificial hibernation ...

427
00:53:32,228 --> 00:53:33,524
Elise.

428
00:55:09,971 --> 00:55:11,738
I'm not crazy.

429
00:55:12,167 --> 00:55:13,930
Come on, it's not that bad!

430
00:55:13,965 --> 00:55:16,873
I didn't say anything mean.

431
00:55:19,187 --> 00:55:20,600
Shall we go, Nemo?

432
00:55:21,423 --> 00:55:24,368
- Excuse me?
- Shall we go? He's such a bore.

433
00:55:44,915 --> 00:55:46,210
You'll drown.

434
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:55,945
- How do you know my name?
- We go to the same school.

435
00:55:56,805 --> 00:56:00,219
You never noticed me.
You never notice anyone.

436
00:56:06,376 --> 00:56:08,142
D'you have a girlfriend?

437
00:56:10,563 --> 00:56:13,036
What? Are you queer?
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

438
00:56:14,062 --> 00:56:15,593
I don't know ...

439
00:56:16,399 --> 00:56:17,929
I ― I don't want one.

440
00:56:20,786 --> 00:56:22,198
Tell me about yourself.

441
00:56:25,997 --> 00:56:29,069
You used to piss your pants,
everyone knows you're weirdo.

442
00:56:30,479 --> 00:56:31,967
You're always alone ...

443
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:36,810
Talk.

444
00:56:39,783 --> 00:56:41,902
Or say something. Come on ...

445
00:56:47,562 --> 00:56:50,858
Gravity on Mars is 0.38.

446
00:56:53,805 --> 00:56:56,395
That's three times
less than on Earth.

447
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:02,252
The ground is covered
with an iron oxide dust.

448
00:57:10,299 --> 00:57:11,359
You're incredible.

449
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,772
- Raise your hand and 
say "I swear." │- Why?

450
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:22,589
Promise me that if I die,
you'll spread my ashes on Mars.

451
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:27,109
It's estimated that travel to Mars
would take six to eight months.

452
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:28,640
Say "I swear."

453
00:57:32,738 --> 00:57:33,680
I swear.

454
00:57:38,811 --> 00:57:40,930
We were neighbors
when we were little.

455
00:57:44,126 --> 00:57:45,303
It's Elise.

456
00:57:46,093 --> 00:57:47,270
Don't you remember?

457
00:57:48,169 --> 00:57:49,463
Elise.

458
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:52,407
I had a feeling I've 
seen you or something.

459
00:57:52,408 --> 00:57:54,299
Yeah, that's called déjà vu.

460
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,356
And the signal from the eyes
goes from the memory ...

461
00:57:57,357 --> 00:57:58,900
No, it's not it.

462
00:58:00,182 --> 00:58:01,871
Another life then?

463
00:58:03,235 --> 00:58:04,413
Anyway ...

464
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,431
I remembered you.

465
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,484
We shouldn't.

466
00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:25,780
You don't know me and 
I am not a good person.

467
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,686
Why do you say that?

468
00:58:50,115 --> 00:58:52,586
- Elise, wait!
- I'll call you.

469
00:58:52,642 --> 00:58:54,762
You don't have my phone number.

470
00:58:57,476 --> 00:59:00,066
What happens when we fall in love?

471
00:59:01,289 --> 00:59:04,469
As a result of certain stimuli,

472
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:08,696
the hypothalamus releases a 
powerful discharges of endorphins ...

473
00:59:08,731 --> 00:59:12,979
but why exactly that 
woman or that man?

474
00:59:13,014 --> 00:59:15,783
Is there a release of
odourless pheromones

475
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:18,986
that correspond to our 
complimentary genetic signal?

476
00:59:19,021 --> 00:59:22,541
Or is it physical features
that we recognize?

477
00:59:22,576 --> 00:59:24,661
A mother's eyes ...

478
00:59:25,309 --> 00:59:28,370
A smell that stimulates
a happy memory.

479
00:59:29,531 --> 00:59:33,297
Is love ... part of a plan?

480
00:59:33,382 --> 00:59:37,621
A vast war plan between two 
modes of reproduction ...

481
00:59:37,681 --> 00:59:41,819
Bacteria and viruses
are asexual organisms.

482
00:59:41,854 --> 00:59:44,623
With each cell division,
each multiplication,

483
00:59:44,658 --> 00:59:47,635
they mutate and perfect themselves
much more quickly than we do.

484
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:52,312
Against this, we respond
with the most fearsome weapon:

485
00:59:52,347 --> 00:59:53,489
Sex.

486
00:59:54,188 --> 00:59:57,366
Two individuals,
by mixing their genes,

487
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:02,938
shuffle the cards and create an 
individual who resists viruses better.

488
01:00:02,973 --> 01:00:05,625
The more dissimilar he or she is.

489
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:11,866
Now, are we unknowing participants in
a war between two modes of reproduction?

490
01:00:15,399 --> 01:00:17,518
Okay everyone, that's it for today.

491
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:21,814
How was it?

492
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:24,202
You want to know the truth?

493
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,910
O'key. It was good. 
It was really good.

494
01:00:29,821 --> 01:00:32,058
- Hey, honey.
- I'm gonna be a little late.

495
01:00:32,137 --> 01:00:33,668
That's okay. Don't worry.

496
01:00:34,379 --> 01:00:37,087
- I love you.
- I love you more.

497
01:00:37,088 --> 01:00:38,998
- Me more.
- Me more.

498
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:41,214
- Okay
- Cheater.

499
01:00:41,978 --> 01:00:43,979
Alright, I'll see ya later.

500
01:01:44,529 --> 01:01:47,002
I always liked fish.

501
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:50,633
I never thought that one day
they would like me too.

502
01:01:53,452 --> 01:01:55,218
You're very relaxed.

503
01:01:56,821 --> 01:01:59,999
Your eyelids are getting heavy.

504
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:03,177
Remember.

505
01:02:04,618 --> 01:02:06,267
Remember ...

506
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:14,065
Remember ...

507
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:19,380
Nemo ...

508
01:03:19,381 --> 01:03:19,761
Shit.

509
01:03:19,927 --> 01:03:20,988
Anna ...

510
01:03:23,726 --> 01:03:27,022
We've got errands to run.
We'll back in an hour.

511
01:03:29,882 --> 01:03:34,004
Anna, cover up!
You're gonna get a sunburn.

512
01:04:52,247 --> 01:04:53,660
I want you.

513
01:04:55,114 --> 01:04:56,527
I want you too.

514
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:59,775
Forever.

515
01:05:03,216 --> 01:05:04,511
Forever.

516
01:05:05,386 --> 01:05:07,151
Whatever happens.

517
01:05:07,781 --> 01:05:09,783
There is no life without you.

518
01:05:10,732 --> 01:05:12,498
No life without you.

519
01:05:36,509 --> 01:05:38,393
You look like my son.

520
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,217
I am your son, Dad.

521
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,006
My son's taller than you.

522
01:05:59,732 --> 01:06:00,732
Elise

523
01:07:05,842 --> 01:07:07,256
Someone just came in.

524
01:07:09,117 --> 01:07:12,414
If I could at least
move my fingers.

525
01:07:13,632 --> 01:07:15,046
Or my eyes.

526
01:07:16,727 --> 01:07:18,611
Do you think he can hear us?

527
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:21,233
Have you seen any reaction?

528
01:07:21,234 --> 01:07:22,391
I don't know, but ...

529
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:24,641
I've got a feeling that he can.

530
01:07:24,642 --> 01:07:25,906
Who's there?

531
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,335
What am I doing here?

532
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:30,450
If you can hear me,
move your fingers.

533
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:31,800
I've got to get out of here.

534
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:34,389
Go back, before the accident.

535
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:06,925
I believe one thing.

536
01:08:09,195 --> 01:08:14,374
I believe that we should always say
"I love you" to the people we love.

537
01:08:21,886 --> 01:08:23,181
I love you.

538
01:08:31,025 --> 01:08:34,556
Nemo ... we shouldn't.

539
01:08:36,188 --> 01:08:37,482
I love Stefano.

540
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:39,827
What?

541
01:08:40,828 --> 01:08:43,301
You saw him at the party with me.

542
01:08:45,383 --> 01:08:47,032
He doesn't love me.

543
01:08:48,713 --> 01:08:49,302
And so ...

544
01:08:49,398 --> 01:08:50,694
I love him anyways.

545
01:08:51,457 --> 01:08:53,341
I can't help myself.

546
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:55,574
I'm in love with him.

547
01:08:58,373 --> 01:08:59,315
I'm sorry.

548
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:13,594
Dad, I'm getting married.

549
01:09:13,844 --> 01:09:14,668
Oh!

550
01:09:15,231 --> 01:09:16,998
And who is the lucky lady?

551
01:09:17,341 --> 01:09:18,400
No, it's not that.

552
01:09:19,976 --> 01:09:22,919
I'm gonna marry the first girl
who dances with me tonight.

553
01:10:01,091 --> 01:10:02,504
Thanks, Nemo.

554
01:10:39,734 --> 01:10:41,030
Nemo.

555
01:10:46,863 --> 01:10:50,983
On that day, I would make
a lot of foolish decisions.

556
01:10:52,274 --> 01:10:55,688
One, I will never leave 
anything to chance again.

557
01:10:55,689 --> 01:10:58,504
Two, I will marry the 
girl on my motorcycle.

558
01:10:59,013 --> 01:11:00,897
Three, I'll be rich.

559
01:11:01,101 --> 01:11:02,867
Four, we'll have a house.

560
01:11:03,261 --> 01:11:04,438
A big house!

561
01:11:04,528 --> 01:11:06,735
Painted yellow, with a garden,

562
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:09,206
and two children, Paul and Michael.

563
01:11:09,207 --> 01:11:12,780
Five, I'll have a convertible ―
A red convertible.

564
01:11:12,815 --> 01:11:15,252
And a swimming pool.
I'll learn to swim.

565
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:19,398
Six, I will not stop
until I've succeeded.

566
01:11:40,559 --> 01:11:41,854
Daddy?

567
01:11:44,088 --> 01:11:45,266
Daddy?

568
01:11:49,497 --> 01:11:51,499
Paul, don't wake your father.

569
01:11:52,397 --> 01:11:53,456
Elise?

570
01:11:54,025 --> 01:11:55,791
It's me, Jean.

571
01:11:58,307 --> 01:11:59,603
Who is Elise?

572
01:12:03,494 --> 01:12:05,377
I don't know anyone called Elise.

573
01:12:06,081 --> 01:12:07,965
Go back and play Paul.

574
01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:13,438
Nemo, do I matter to you?

575
01:12:17,213 --> 01:12:18,155
I just ...

576
01:12:18,389 --> 01:12:20,978
I just like to ask 
you one question.

577
01:12:22,334 --> 01:12:24,336
Did you do it on purpose?

578
01:12:27,321 --> 01:12:30,029
I found this on the bedside table.

579
01:12:31,064 --> 01:12:35,411
There comes a time in life
when everything seems narrow.

580
01:12:35,446 --> 01:12:40,120
Choices have been made
I can only continue on.

581
01:12:40,429 --> 01:12:43,490
I know myself like
the back of my hand.

582
01:12:44,536 --> 01:12:47,243
I can predict my every reaction.

583
01:12:47,244 --> 01:12:48,850
Everything is predictable.

584
01:12:49,549 --> 01:12:54,376
My life has been cast in cement
with airbags and seatbelts.

585
01:12:54,377 --> 01:12:56,289
I've controlled everything.

586
01:12:56,316 --> 01:13:00,908
I've done everything to reach
this point and now that I'm here,

587
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,279
I'm fucking bored.

588
01:13:05,427 --> 01:13:08,842
The hardest thing is knowing
whether I'm still alive.

589
01:13:16,516 --> 01:13:18,752
It is my handwriting.

590
01:13:19,967 --> 01:13:21,968
I don't remember.

591
01:13:39,546 --> 01:13:40,371
Jean?

592
01:13:44,318 --> 01:13:45,965
What did you say?

593
01:13:49,435 --> 01:13:50,848
I had a weird dream.

594
01:14:11,133 --> 01:14:14,340
Well, it's important 
for you to understand.

595
01:14:14,341 --> 01:14:17,957
In life things don't 
always turn out ...

596
01:14:18,531 --> 01:14:20,373
as we plan them.

597
01:14:21,096 --> 01:14:22,879
Harry and I thought ...

598
01:14:25,396 --> 01:14:27,511
Life isn't what we 
all think it will be.

599
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,247
What are you talking about?

600
01:14:31,495 --> 01:14:32,674
I don't understand.

601
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:35,668
Anna knows already.

602
01:14:38,614 --> 01:14:41,205
Harry and I are going to separate.

603
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,739
What?

604
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:46,370
Why?

605
01:14:48,265 --> 01:14:51,915
- You have no right!
- Please, you played your part!

606
01:14:52,044 --> 01:14:54,164
I don't know what is going on
between you two

607
01:14:54,175 --> 01:14:56,647
and I don't wanna know.
It's sick!

608
01:14:56,777 --> 01:15:02,078
- You're brother and sister, for God's sake.
- We are not brother and sister!

609
01:15:08,805 --> 01:15:09,983
You knew!

610
01:15:11,565 --> 01:15:13,212
And you didn't tell me.

611
01:15:21,011 --> 01:15:22,305
Where are you going?

612
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:26,560
To New York.

613
01:15:28,805 --> 01:15:31,041
In ten days.

614
01:15:32,579 --> 01:15:34,934
My father found a job there.

615
01:15:45,053 --> 01:15:47,407
Wait for me near the lighthouse ...

616
01:15:48,016 --> 01:15:50,136
every Sunday, okay?

617
01:15:51,887 --> 01:15:54,242
Until we see each other again.

618
01:15:54,347 --> 01:15:56,583
For life, okay?

619
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:02,111
It's not over.

620
01:16:09,585 --> 01:16:13,235
You're the first and last 
person I'll ever love.

621
01:16:14,877 --> 01:16:16,408
Ten days.

622
01:16:18,488 --> 01:16:19,430
That makes ...

623
01:16:21,137 --> 01:16:22,785
14 thousand ...

624
01:16:23,693 --> 01:16:25,577
400 minutes.

625
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:32,338
I wish everything
would stop right now.

626
01:16:34,637 --> 01:16:36,993
Things would stay
this way forever.

627
01:16:39,878 --> 01:16:42,703
They say that if you 
slow your breathing ...

628
01:16:43,873 --> 01:16:45,639
time slows down.

629
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,465
The Hindu say so.

630
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:34,870
I have to remember the smell
of every part of your body.

631
01:17:44,482 --> 01:17:46,603
We'll meet near the lighthouse.

632
01:18:10,302 --> 01:18:12,304
Anna, it's time to go.

633
01:18:22,687 --> 01:18:24,218
I love you.

634
01:19:07,984 --> 01:19:10,927
Anna!

635
01:19:46,537 --> 01:19:47,361
Anna ...

636
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:49,834
Can you hear me?

637
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:14,173
We must look to the future.

638
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:16,978
It will be good to move house.

639
01:20:17,248 --> 01:20:18,543
Have a new life.

640
01:20:19,475 --> 01:20:20,889
Will we have a pool?

641
01:20:21,696 --> 01:20:24,169
You hate water.
You don't even swim.

642
01:20:24,844 --> 01:20:27,785
- You never know what you want.
- You know what I don't want?

643
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:30,728
So tell me, what is it
you don't want?

644
01:20:32,877 --> 01:20:34,878
I don't want to be like you.

645
01:20:37,345 --> 01:20:38,876
You know nothing about me.

646
01:20:40,228 --> 01:20:42,112
I've always loved pools.

647
01:20:44,388 --> 01:20:46,154
When I'm older, I'll have a pool.

648
01:21:42,056 --> 01:21:43,234
Anna.

649
01:21:44,757 --> 01:21:45,463
Anna.

650
01:21:47,643 --> 01:21:51,528
I feel like I'll be seeing you
at every street corner.

651
01:22:13,215 --> 01:22:15,688
Sometimes I tell myself ...

652
01:22:16,377 --> 01:22:18,968
maybe you live in 
the same town I do

653
01:22:19,281 --> 01:22:21,047
and I don't know where.

654
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:24,559
Maybe you're here, very close.

655
01:22:25,241 --> 01:22:28,655
Nemo, do you hear my voice?

656
01:22:30,731 --> 01:22:31,910
Anna!

657
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,429
After 90 days, the onboard computer

658
01:22:36,464 --> 01:22:39,138
is still maintaining
the passengers' metabolism

659
01:22:39,173 --> 01:22:41,610
at the level of a 
hibernating frog.

660
01:23:07,841 --> 01:23:09,960
He'd always been 
fascinated by the fact ...

661
01:23:10,049 --> 01:23:13,478
that certain frogs can spend
the winter completely frozen.

662
01:23:13,513 --> 01:23:15,833
and that when spring comes comma,

663
01:23:15,834 --> 01:23:20,025
they defrost and begin 
living again period.

664
01:23:21,576 --> 01:23:23,695
The onboard computer displayed ...

665
01:23:24,005 --> 01:23:26,360
"End of hibernation".

666
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:42,296
Welcome to Mars.

667
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,510
We hope you had a pleasant dream
and a refreshing re-awakening.

668
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:52,204
Please leave your sleep suits in
your suspended animation cubicles ...

669
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:55,618
and make your way through 
to the Arrivals lounge.

670
01:23:57,265 --> 01:24:00,503
You will be directed to the 
rest and recoveration rooms ...

671
01:24:00,538 --> 01:24:05,094
to prepare for your first excursion
to the red planet itself.

672
01:24:08,467 --> 01:24:11,159
Probably the worst thing
about being on Mars ...

673
01:24:11,194 --> 01:24:13,279
is that nothing
will happen there.

674
01:24:13,779 --> 01:24:16,135
Time will seem stole and empty.

675
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,152
That doesn't look
like there's much to do.

676
01:24:20,293 --> 01:24:22,412
I hope I brought enough we took.

677
01:24:50,315 --> 01:24:51,257
Day time.

678
01:24:52,855 --> 01:24:54,151
It's day time.

679
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:56,932
The sun is out.

680
01:24:58,562 --> 01:25:01,388
It's warmer on the right
than on the left ...

681
01:25:05,027 --> 01:25:09,618
She's different
from the one this morning.

682
01:25:11,631 --> 01:25:13,514
Not the same perfume.

683
01:25:15,849 --> 01:25:17,850
Her hands are soft.

684
01:25:20,128 --> 01:25:21,306
Elise.

685
01:25:23,957 --> 01:25:25,486
Is that Elise?

686
01:25:29,762 --> 01:25:32,000
We sh ... We shouldn't.

687
01:25:34,255 --> 01:25:36,374
- I love Stefano.
- Shh.

688
01:25:38,611 --> 01:25:39,906
Don't say anything.

689
01:25:41,008 --> 01:25:42,303
You're the one I love.

690
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:46,065
You can count on me for Mars.

691
01:25:47,513 --> 01:25:48,690
I promise.

692
01:26:26,609 --> 01:26:28,847
Do you wanna go for 
a walk or something?

693
01:26:30,415 --> 01:26:32,534
I don't want anything.

694
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,559
Nothing.

695
01:26:39,426 --> 01:26:42,488
- I'm so horrible.
- No, you're not.

696
01:26:42,696 --> 01:26:46,168
- You're not horrible.
- I can't stand this life anymore.

697
01:26:46,203 --> 01:26:48,781
Think about it, you've got
the most incredible kids.

698
01:26:48,816 --> 01:26:52,431
Stop trying to make me feel better.
I'm actually feeling guiltier.

699
01:26:56,235 --> 01:26:58,590
What's wrong with me?

700
01:27:01,163 --> 01:27:03,283
What is wrong with me?

701
01:27:12,455 --> 01:27:13,514
How's Mom?

702
01:27:14,485 --> 01:27:17,076
She's just a little tired.
She's sleeping.

703
01:27:17,235 --> 01:27:21,710
- She's always tired.
- Yeah, she's always tired.

704
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:24,365
Is she depressed?

705
01:27:25,059 --> 01:27:26,708
Well, she has ups and downs.

706
01:27:27,432 --> 01:27:28,610
I don't know about you,

707
01:27:28,637 --> 01:27:30,644
but next time Mom
has one of her meltdowns,

708
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:32,528
I'm gonna go live somewhere else.

709
01:27:37,647 --> 01:27:41,650
So ... who has a joke?

710
01:27:43,081 --> 01:27:43,786
Anybody?

711
01:27:45,783 --> 01:27:46,725
I do.

712
01:27:47,493 --> 01:27:52,320
What's green, small
and goes up and down?

713
01:27:52,971 --> 01:27:54,696
A pea in an elevator.

714
01:27:54,731 --> 01:27:58,346
It's not funny. Old people humor.

715
01:28:00,277 --> 01:28:01,454
Are you gonna be okay?

716
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:05,586
Of course. Not 'cause Mom's
not okay that I'm not okay.

717
01:28:25,218 --> 01:28:27,102
I can't stand it anymore.

718
01:28:27,623 --> 01:28:31,154
- That noise ...
- I'll ask them to keep it down.

719
01:28:32,351 --> 01:28:34,587
But it is Joyce's birthday.

720
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:39,507
What kind of mother am I?

721
01:28:42,977 --> 01:28:43,919
I gotta get up.

722
01:29:07,689 --> 01:29:09,220
- Are you having a good time?
- Yeah.

723
01:29:09,246 --> 01:29:10,659
Can I tell you one thing?

724
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:12,790
You're not allowed to be partying
and not have a good time.

725
01:29:12,873 --> 01:29:13,406
It doesn't work that way.

726
01:29:13,441 --> 01:29:14,927
- I know ...
- And you know what, Tess?

727
01:29:14,962 --> 01:29:16,458
You look beautiful.

728
01:29:16,492 --> 01:29:18,361
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ...

729
01:29:18,396 --> 01:29:20,127
But your friends aren't
dancing enough ...

730
01:29:20,163 --> 01:29:22,989
And your mother has to
take care of the situation!

731
01:29:23,976 --> 01:29:25,036
Dancing!

732
01:29:27,518 --> 01:29:28,695
You, over there!

733
01:29:43,108 --> 01:29:44,874
Oh, oh! This makes me like ...

734
01:29:46,376 --> 01:29:47,554
Like a dog!

735
01:29:57,852 --> 01:30:00,795
Now let's get ready.
Take one ... two ... three!

736
01:30:22,929 --> 01:30:25,047
It was a nice day.

737
01:30:27,578 --> 01:30:29,815
Nicest in a long time.

738
01:30:35,259 --> 01:30:37,143
Okey-dokey.

739
01:30:37,144 --> 01:30:38,587
- Ready?
- Bye, Dad.

740
01:30:39,629 --> 01:30:41,748
Bye. Bye.

741
01:30:41,749 --> 01:30:43,035
- Have fun.
- Bye, Dad.

742
01:30:44,271 --> 01:30:45,213
Bye-bye!

743
01:32:05,795 --> 01:32:07,171
I'm leaving!

744
01:32:07,172 --> 01:32:09,314
I'm leaving! I'm leaving!

745
01:32:36,930 --> 01:32:38,075
Everything will be OK.

746
01:32:39,435 --> 01:32:40,892
That will be all right. C'mon.

747
01:32:52,292 --> 01:32:53,909
Do you love me?

748
01:32:55,793 --> 01:32:58,057
I could not live without you.

749
01:36:08,223 --> 01:36:10,302
There is no life without you.

750
01:36:16,110 --> 01:36:17,641
Go slowly.

751
01:36:20,816 --> 01:36:22,700
I have to get used to it.

752
01:36:26,812 --> 01:36:32,345
I talked to you so much when you
weren't there. It's so strange for me ...

753
01:36:32,646 --> 01:36:34,647
to talk to you for real.

754
01:36:52,077 --> 01:36:54,078
I need some time, Nemo.

755
01:36:56,768 --> 01:36:58,887
When we were separated at 15,

756
01:36:59,059 --> 01:37:02,114
I said I would never love
anyone else.

757
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:02,939
Ever.

758
01:37:04,369 --> 01:37:06,253
I would never become attached.

759
01:37:06,834 --> 01:37:08,953
I'd never see you put anywhere.

760
01:37:09,277 --> 01:37:11,396
I'd have nothing for myself.

761
01:37:14,567 --> 01:37:18,335
I decided I would 
pretend to be alive.

762
01:37:23,335 --> 01:37:25,571
And this is what 
I've been waiting for.

763
01:37:26,251 --> 01:37:28,252
All this time ...

764
01:37:30,269 --> 01:37:35,332
Renouncing all possible 
lives, for one only ...

765
01:37:36,433 --> 01:37:37,492
With you.

766
01:37:47,519 --> 01:37:49,276
But I'm not used to it anymore.

767
01:37:51,027 --> 01:37:54,850
you know ... love ... I mean.

768
01:37:58,722 --> 01:38:00,828
I'm afraid of losing you again,

769
01:38:01,446 --> 01:38:04,079
I'm afraid of having 
to do without you again ...

770
01:38:04,505 --> 01:38:05,209
I ...

771
01:38:06,059 --> 01:38:07,655
I'm terrified of that.

772
01:38:13,063 --> 01:38:14,748
We need to take some time

773
01:38:16,253 --> 01:38:18,585
And, when will I see you again?

774
01:38:26,065 --> 01:38:27,589
Call me at this number ...

775
01:38:31,365 --> 01:38:32,494
in two days ...

776
01:38:36,848 --> 01:38:38,518
I'll meet you at the lighthouse.

777
01:39:21,849 --> 01:39:24,791
You know why I lost Anna?

778
01:39:26,421 --> 01:39:28,892
because two months earlier ...

779
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:32,574
An unemployed Brazilian 
boiled an egg ...

780
01:39:38,339 --> 01:39:42,383
The heat created a 
micro-climate in the room ...

781
01:39:43,131 --> 01:39:45,639
slight difference of temperature.

782
01:39:48,573 --> 01:39:52,582
and heavy rain, two months later
on the other side of the world ...

783
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:59,707
that Brazilian boiled an egg
instead of being at work ...

784
01:40:00,115 --> 01:40:02,771
He would have lost his job
in a clothing factory ...

785
01:40:03,116 --> 01:40:04,827
because six months earlier ...

786
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:07,327
I would have compared
the prices of jeans ...

787
01:40:07,328 --> 01:40:09,612
and I will have bought
the cheaper pair.

788
01:40:10,003 --> 01:40:11,867
As the Chinese proverb says ...

789
01:40:12,350 --> 01:40:15,088
"A single snowflake can bend 
the leaf of the bamboo."

790
01:40:16,562 --> 01:40:19,934
Jeans production will have
moved to other countries.

791
01:40:28,442 --> 01:40:31,058
I lost every trace of Anna.

792
01:40:34,902 --> 01:40:36,435
I waited for her ...

793
01:40:37,897 --> 01:40:39,040
every day.

794
01:42:09,966 --> 01:42:10,533
Anna.

795
01:42:15,394 --> 01:42:16,475
Nemo.

796
01:42:26,718 --> 01:42:27,718
It's back.

797
01:42:27,719 --> 01:42:29,169
The fear is back.

798
01:42:29,204 --> 01:42:31,696
I'm sick of pills!

799
01:42:31,744 --> 01:42:34,928
I'm sick of doctors. 
It's pointless.

800
01:42:35,614 --> 01:42:38,309
I'll do something. 
I can't stand it any more.

801
01:42:38,310 --> 01:42:40,082
I'm afraid.

802
01:42:40,422 --> 01:42:42,346
I don't know what to do ...

803
01:42:46,659 --> 01:42:48,326
I often have this dream.

804
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:50,963
It's a prehistoric time.

805
01:42:52,821 --> 01:42:54,268
I can hear you screaming ...

806
01:43:06,432 --> 01:43:07,861
I chased the bear.

807
01:43:08,882 --> 01:43:10,875
And you're not afraid anymore.

808
01:43:11,586 --> 01:43:13,193
But when I wake up ...

809
01:43:15,328 --> 01:43:16,949
When I wake up ...

810
01:43:17,490 --> 01:43:18,889
there's no bear ...

811
01:43:20,373 --> 01:43:22,381
but you're still afraid.

812
01:43:22,877 --> 01:43:24,844
I'm not a bear hunter ...

813
01:43:25,799 --> 01:43:29,010
I'm an executive of a plant that
manufactures photocopy machines ...

814
01:43:29,573 --> 01:43:31,042
who just quit his job.

815
01:43:32,767 --> 01:43:33,924
I don't dare to move.

816
01:43:35,777 --> 01:43:36,686
I don't live ...

817
01:43:38,452 --> 01:43:40,356
All of I do is a disaster ...

818
01:43:43,209 --> 01:43:45,919
I would so love to be able
to chase the bear away ...

819
01:43:46,915 --> 01:43:48,937
and for you not 
to be afraid anymore.

820
01:43:53,011 --> 01:43:55,728
To what extent are 
our fears innate?

821
01:43:57,426 --> 01:43:59,593
When we hatch goose eggs
in an incubator,

822
01:44:00,095 --> 01:44:05,069
and then, above the baby birds pass 
a form simulating a goose in flight,

823
01:44:05,889 --> 01:44:08,307
the birds stretch their 
necks and call out.

824
01:44:08,754 --> 01:44:10,878
But if we invert the direction
of the silhouette,

825
01:44:12,352 --> 01:44:14,131
it conjures the 
shape of a falcon.

826
01:44:14,563 --> 01:44:16,965
The response of the 
baby birds is immediate.

827
01:44:17,535 --> 01:44:21,271
They will crouch and fear, though
they've never before seen a falcon.

828
01:44:21,588 --> 01:44:23,712
Without any instruction,

829
01:44:24,535 --> 01:44:27,560
an innate fear helps 
them to survive.

830
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:30,181
But in humans ...

831
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:33,341
to what ancient dangers ...

832
01:44:34,027 --> 01:44:36,312
might our innate fears correspond?

833
01:45:30,411 --> 01:45:31,411
Hey.

834
01:45:31,994 --> 01:45:32,468
Hey!

835
01:45:33,746 --> 01:45:34,679
Excuse me!

836
01:46:19,881 --> 01:46:21,365
Remember ...

837
01:46:22,988 --> 01:46:24,362
Remember!

838
01:47:38,913 --> 01:47:40,129
Honey, it's me.

839
01:48:57,403 --> 01:48:59,606
Did Elise die or didn't she?

840
01:49:00,734 --> 01:49:01,781
I don't get it.

841
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:05,151
You can't have had children
and not have had them.

842
01:49:14,949 --> 01:49:15,918
Hi, Dad.

843
01:49:18,228 --> 01:49:18,610
Hi.

844
01:49:20,088 --> 01:49:21,018
Hey.

845
01:49:22,842 --> 01:49:24,465
I'll be in a minute, guys.

846
01:49:47,975 --> 01:49:50,905
- You're not hungry?
- I don't want anything.

847
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:52,715
Nothing.

848
01:49:56,742 --> 01:49:57,950
What are you doing today?

849
01:49:58,945 --> 01:50:02,723
I was thinking about taking
the opportunity to wash the car.

850
01:50:08,698 --> 01:50:10,118
What's the deal with that car?

851
01:50:12,605 --> 01:50:13,712
What do you mean?

852
01:50:14,904 --> 01:50:18,384
Why do you such good care of that car
while you leave me here all alone?

853
01:50:20,907 --> 01:50:22,336
What's the problem of the car?

854
01:51:11,509 --> 01:51:13,870
There's no more 
problem with the car.

855
01:51:28,342 --> 01:51:29,382
What's wrong?

856
01:51:30,105 --> 01:51:31,845
Why are you looking 
at me like that?

857
01:51:32,991 --> 01:51:35,020
Why are you looking 
at me like that?

858
01:51:37,263 --> 01:51:38,248
Nemo.

859
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:42,156
Do I take sugar in my coffee?

860
01:51:44,825 --> 01:51:47,250
Can you please answer me?

861
01:51:47,678 --> 01:51:48,678
Nemo.

862
01:51:52,862 --> 01:51:56,674
You don't know me, Nemo.
You've never really looked at me.

863
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:06,251
You've always been elsewhere.

864
01:52:07,848 --> 01:52:11,075
Do you realize how 
much you've hurt me?

865
01:52:19,603 --> 01:52:24,593
I got a call from the lawyer. He
just says you just put everything ...

866
01:52:24,594 --> 01:52:26,603
you own on my name.

867
01:52:27,766 --> 01:52:29,458
Why, Nemo?

868
01:52:30,853 --> 01:52:32,779
What you're up to?

869
01:52:50,942 --> 01:52:53,070
Are you angling for success?

870
01:52:53,071 --> 01:52:54,938
Then you need a
butterfly fishing rod.

871
01:52:54,973 --> 01:52:57,956
For tension and strength is  ....

872
01:52:57,957 --> 01:53:01,068
Buy one today, available now.

873
01:53:08,167 --> 01:53:09,167
Jean.

874
01:53:10,171 --> 01:53:12,235
I'm off to buy a fishing rod.

875
01:54:00,116 --> 01:54:01,443
Mr. Jones.

876
01:54:03,378 --> 01:54:05,771
- Yes.
- We already have your luggage.

877
01:54:05,806 --> 01:54:07,700
Please, follow me.

878
01:54:07,735 --> 01:54:10,332
I'll take you to the hotel
where you can rest for a while.

879
01:54:10,367 --> 01:54:12,427
The appointment is at 3 PM.

880
01:54:39,002 --> 01:54:40,368
Daniel.

881
01:54:41,182 --> 01:54:43,029
Daniel Jones.

882
01:54:43,064 --> 01:54:45,450
Daniel Jones.

883
01:54:46,855 --> 01:54:50,271
Is your name Daniel Jones?

884
01:54:52,115 --> 01:54:54,665
Of course not!

885
01:54:59,685 --> 01:55:01,982
Daniel Jones ...

886
01:55:05,323 --> 01:55:06,323
Hallo?

887
01:55:07,168 --> 01:55:08,168
Daniel?

888
01:55:09,104 --> 01:55:10,104
Yes.

889
01:55:10,442 --> 01:55:12,473
Are you insane?

890
01:55:12,474 --> 01:55:15,130
I told you not to go. 
They are furious!

891
01:55:15,131 --> 01:55:17,537
They know it's you. 
Don't stay there!

892
01:55:51,042 --> 01:55:52,777
This is weird.

893
01:55:53,365 --> 01:55:55,601
His shoes are different sizes.

894
01:56:06,958 --> 01:56:08,309
Maybe he shrunk.

895
01:56:08,344 --> 01:56:10,806
Times when you get 
older, you shrink.

896
01:56:10,841 --> 01:56:12,499
No one shrinks,
that's rubbish.

897
01:56:12,906 --> 01:56:14,576
You got the wrong plug, 
that's all.

898
01:56:15,478 --> 01:56:18,180
Astronauts shrink two inches
when they come back to Earth.

899
01:56:18,738 --> 01:56:22,039
- Because of gravity or something.
- You think this fellow is an astronaut?

900
01:56:52,546 --> 01:56:55,307
The ground doesn't vibrate
in the same way.

901
01:56:57,854 --> 01:56:59,349
It's a different perfume.

902
01:57:01,348 --> 01:57:03,404
How old might she be?

903
01:57:03,896 --> 01:57:05,329
Twenty five?

904
01:57:07,732 --> 01:57:10,605
There are other people too.

905
01:57:19,532 --> 01:57:22,012
Let's begin again.

906
01:57:22,538 --> 01:57:24,235
Fingers on the keyboard.

907
01:57:26,199 --> 01:57:29,384
Left hand: A, S, D, F.

908
01:57:31,052 --> 01:57:34,129
Right hand: H, J, K, L.

909
01:58:51,228 --> 01:58:54,698
- What's wrong?
- I was dreaming about Stefano.

910
01:58:58,047 --> 01:58:59,858
He doesn't give a damn about me.

911
01:59:01,616 --> 01:59:02,616
Stefano?

912
01:59:09,364 --> 01:59:10,414
I love him.

913
01:59:12,805 --> 01:59:15,396
I can't see any other explanation
for being in this state.

914
01:59:18,121 --> 01:59:19,586
That's the only thing it can be.

915
01:59:21,655 --> 01:59:22,723
I love him.

916
01:59:25,501 --> 01:59:26,779
I know I'm crazy.

917
01:59:29,449 --> 01:59:32,398
Every morning when I wake up,
I open my eyes and I see your face

918
01:59:32,789 --> 01:59:34,390
and I start crying.

919
01:59:37,617 --> 01:59:41,155
I realize that with you,
my life is passing me by.

920
01:59:45,454 --> 01:59:48,503
How can you stay so calm?

921
01:59:48,503 --> 01:59:51,215
How can you bear that?

922
01:59:51,216 --> 01:59:53,096
You're not human.

923
01:59:53,097 --> 01:59:54,674
I don't know what to do.

924
01:59:56,449 --> 01:59:58,281
It's not my fault, right?

925
01:59:58,670 --> 02:00:00,634
You're not gonna leave me,
are you?

926
02:00:01,235 --> 02:00:03,172
No, I couldn't live without you.

927
02:00:06,079 --> 02:00:07,575
I've hurt everybody.

928
02:00:08,787 --> 02:00:10,334
I've hurt you.

929
02:00:11,615 --> 02:00:13,155
The children ...

930
02:00:14,612 --> 02:00:17,623
- I just can't go on.
- Together we can do it.

931
02:00:17,996 --> 02:00:20,705
If I stay here, you're all 
gonna end up drowning with me.

932
02:00:22,105 --> 02:00:23,546
We'll learn to swim.

933
02:00:24,694 --> 02:00:25,757
I love you.

934
02:00:27,777 --> 02:00:28,885
I love you.

935
02:00:31,757 --> 02:00:33,305
I love you.

936
02:00:53,587 --> 02:00:54,786
She left me.

937
02:00:59,858 --> 02:01:02,285
You know what they say ...

938
02:01:03,494 --> 02:01:06,180
Everything works out in the end,

939
02:01:08,137 --> 02:01:09,321
even badly.

940
02:01:38,714 --> 02:01:39,333
Hello?

941
02:01:50,495 --> 02:01:52,899
Not too much at the top, thanks.

942
02:02:06,154 --> 02:02:08,321
- How much should that be?
- $20, please.

943
02:02:09,668 --> 02:02:11,145
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

944
02:02:24,192 --> 02:02:27,003
- $20 please, sir.
- Here you are.

945
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:28,490
Thank you. Bye, sir.

946
02:02:28,824 --> 02:02:31,559
Bye, and have a nice afternoon.

947
02:02:55,988 --> 02:02:59,286
Why does cigarette smoke
never go back into the cigarette?

948
02:03:00,023 --> 02:03:02,323
Why do molecules spread
away from each other?

949
02:03:02,883 --> 02:03:05,231
Why does a spilled drop
of ink never reform?

950
02:03:05,997 --> 02:03:10,056
Because the Universe moves 
towards a state of dissipation.

951
02:03:10,641 --> 02:03:12,336
That is the principle of entropy ...

952
02:03:12,631 --> 02:03:14,225
The tendency of the Universe

953
02:03:14,708 --> 02:03:17,764
to evolve toward a state
of increasing disorder.

954
02:03:18,403 --> 02:03:19,751
The principle of entropy

955
02:03:19,890 --> 02:03:22,574
is related to the arrow of time ...

956
02:03:23,115 --> 02:03:25,480
A result of the expansion
of the Universe.

957
02:03:25,754 --> 02:03:27,828
But what will happen
when gravitational forces ...

958
02:03:27,935 --> 02:03:30,443
counter-balance
the forces of expansion?

959
02:03:31,173 --> 02:03:33,771
Or if the energy of the 
quantum void proves too weak?

960
02:03:34,530 --> 02:03:38,152
At that moment, the universe
might enter its phase of contraction.

961
02:03:38,803 --> 02:03:40,029
The Big Crunch.

962
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:45,798
So what will become of time?

963
02:03:49,755 --> 02:03:50,890
Will it reverse?

964
02:03:58,054 --> 02:03:59,766
No one knows the answer.

965
02:04:05,085 --> 02:04:06,085
Where is Peter?

966
02:04:06,086 --> 02:04:10,429
He left an hour ago. I'm replacing
him. I've selected take 3 and take 4.

967
02:04:10,877 --> 02:04:14,077
I prefer that Peter does it. I don't 
mean to say you're not good enough.

968
02:04:14,078 --> 02:04:15,078
But ...

969
02:04:15,704 --> 02:04:18,127
Drop it. In live you get one take.

970
02:04:18,128 --> 02:04:20,659
If it's bad, you just deal with it.

971
02:04:49,615 --> 02:04:51,182
You know him?

972
02:04:52,115 --> 02:04:54,153
We work together.

973
02:04:55,661 --> 02:04:59,136
If I should die, 
and you should live,

974
02:05:32,033 --> 02:05:33,564
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

975
02:05:33,565 --> 02:05:35,837
My sincerest condolences.

976
02:05:35,993 --> 02:05:37,934
Peter was a colleague.

977
02:05:38,345 --> 02:05:39,394
Of course.

978
02:05:39,429 --> 02:05:42,368
I've seen your show.
Thank you for coming.

979
02:06:15,603 --> 02:06:17,537
Please take
this opportunity to take ...

980
02:06:17,702 --> 02:06:20,322
one last close look
at the planet's surface.

981
02:06:20,825 --> 02:06:23,008
from our observation dome.

982
02:06:23,244 --> 02:06:27,727
Your elevator will arrive shortly
in the Mars transit station.

983
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:36,383
What are we doing
with all those bikes?

984
02:06:37,361 --> 02:06:40,165
They're for export.
Labor is much cheaper here.

985
02:06:40,611 --> 02:06:43,125
China has become
way too expensive.

986
02:06:45,094 --> 02:06:47,477
Please proceed
to the preparation area ...

987
02:06:48,210 --> 02:06:51,508
where you will be reissued
to your sleep suits.

988
02:06:51,973 --> 02:06:55,276
You will also receive your ...

989
02:06:55,754 --> 02:06:56,412
Hi.

990
02:06:57,646 --> 02:06:58,663
I'm Nemo.

991
02:06:59,761 --> 02:07:00,479
Anna ...

992
02:07:01,555 --> 02:07:02,723
Nice to meet you.

993
02:07:07,558 --> 02:07:08,902
What brings you to Mars?

994
02:07:09,835 --> 02:07:14,333
I'm measuring the distance between
Mars and Earth at it's greatest.

995
02:07:14,908 --> 02:07:17,128
I study time. You know ...

996
02:07:17,682 --> 02:07:21,063
Thing that makes it so that
everything doesn't happen at once.

997
02:07:24,741 --> 02:07:25,497
And?

998
02:07:25,666 --> 02:07:27,966
The Big Crunch will 
happen in 2092 ...

999
02:07:28,237 --> 02:07:32,895
and people who can't hang
on that long will get a free run.

1000
02:07:34,247 --> 02:07:35,204
And you?

1001
02:07:35,754 --> 02:07:37,716
I'm just keeping an old promise.

1002
02:07:43,633 --> 02:07:44,633
Hi.

1003
02:07:45,402 --> 02:07:46,402
Hi.

1004
02:07:47,896 --> 02:07:50,696
We ah ... met at your 
husband's funeral.

1005
02:07:51,579 --> 02:07:52,579
Right.

1006
02:07:53,199 --> 02:07:55,948
I had the strangest feeling when
I saw you that we have met before.

1007
02:07:57,083 --> 02:07:59,234
It's called Déjà vu.

1008
02:07:59,235 --> 02:08:00,802
That's not it.

1009
02:08:01,648 --> 02:08:03,399
It's as if ...

1010
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:05,654
all of this was in real.

1011
02:08:07,442 --> 02:08:11,322
I'm sorry you must think
that I'm completely crazy.

1012
02:08:12,391 --> 02:08:14,991
I'm not trying to flirt with you.

1013
02:08:14,992 --> 02:08:16,615
I am widower myself.

1014
02:08:16,616 --> 02:08:19,015
I ... I'm sorry. I have to go.

1015
02:08:19,016 --> 02:08:20,763
May be some other time.

1016
02:08:26,266 --> 02:08:27,266
Nemo?

1017
02:08:28,610 --> 02:08:31,570
I heard you were dead.
That you drowned.

1018
02:08:31,571 --> 02:08:33,008
Drowned?

1019
02:09:46,166 --> 02:09:49,339
Alert! Alert! Meteors approaching.

1020
02:09:50,378 --> 02:09:51,382
Don't panic.

1021
02:09:53,069 --> 02:09:55,024
Alert! Alert!

1022
02:10:13,588 --> 02:10:14,855
I wanna wake up.

1023
02:10:16,744 --> 02:10:18,165
I wanna wake up!

1024
02:10:18,804 --> 02:10:20,434
I wanna wake up!

1025
02:10:24,899 --> 02:10:26,216
Are you alright?

1026
02:10:28,252 --> 02:10:29,557
Are you alright?

1027
02:10:31,256 --> 02:10:34,142
When I say three, you'll be awake.

1028
02:10:35,242 --> 02:10:36,254
One ...

1029
02:10:41,367 --> 02:10:42,373
Two ...

1030
02:10:48,586 --> 02:10:49,256
Three.

1031
02:11:36,285 --> 02:11:38,436
- Mother.
- Do I know you?

1032
02:11:39,423 --> 02:11:41,203
- It's me!
- What do you want?

1033
02:11:41,466 --> 02:11:43,236
- Henry!
- It's me.  Your son, Nemo.

1034
02:11:44,325 --> 02:11:45,929
My son's just here.

1035
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:51,692
I don't know you. You're mad. Now 
go away or I'll call the police.

1036
02:11:52,811 --> 02:11:53,262
Mother.

1037
02:11:53,686 --> 02:11:54,718
Mother.

1038
02:12:11,370 --> 02:12:12,993
What do you see?

1039
02:12:12,994 --> 02:12:15,143
He asks me what I see.

1040
02:12:19,475 --> 02:12:21,786
I say, it's an ink stain.

1041
02:12:22,718 --> 02:12:23,705
He says:

1042
02:12:23,706 --> 02:12:25,874
You have to say more.

1043
02:12:26,044 --> 02:12:29,183
I say, it's an ink stain 
on a sheet of paper.

1044
02:12:30,557 --> 02:12:31,557
No.

1045
02:12:32,521 --> 02:12:36,312
You have to say, what
goes through your mind.

1046
02:12:40,844 --> 02:12:43,091
It makes me think of an inkwell.

1047
02:12:43,142 --> 02:12:45,695
So he says: "O'key ...

1048
02:12:46,774 --> 02:12:48,394
That's fine".

1049
02:13:02,673 --> 02:13:05,424
You have until tomorrow to vote.

1050
02:13:05,898 --> 02:13:06,898
Vote!

1051
02:13:06,899 --> 02:13:08,952
And win a vacation on the Moon.

1052
02:13:08,953 --> 02:13:10,371
For the whole family.

1053
02:13:11,175 --> 02:13:13,103
Win a trip to the Moon!

1054
02:13:13,587 --> 02:13:16,363
Take a swing at a 
fabulous golf vacation.

1055
02:13:29,405 --> 02:13:32,335
Have they announced
the results of the voting?

1056
02:13:33,364 --> 02:13:34,781
I'm sorry.

1057
02:13:34,782 --> 02:13:37,499
At my age.

1058
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:41,287
The candles cost more than a cake.

1059
02:13:45,394 --> 02:13:47,845
I'm not afraid of dying.

1060
02:13:48,149 --> 02:13:51,208
I'm afraid I haven't 
been alive enough!

1061
02:13:54,610 --> 02:13:58,852
It should be written on every
schoolroom blackboard.

1062
02:14:00,639 --> 02:14:03,382
Life is a playground.

1063
02:14:04,949 --> 02:14:06,869
Or nothing.

1064
02:14:13,387 --> 02:14:14,111
Nemo. Leave.

1065
02:14:18,219 --> 02:14:21,431
Nemo. Leave.

1066
02:14:28,499 --> 02:14:29,499
Nemo!

1067
02:15:00,785 --> 02:15:02,525
Tragic car accident
on a country road ...

1068
02:15:04,394 --> 02:15:06,534
Nemo turn to page 5 ...

1069
02:15:07,357 --> 02:15:09,723
Nemo look at the
end of the street ...

1070
02:15:24,524 --> 02:15:27,467
- Hello, who is this?
- Hello, who is this?

1071
02:15:28,166 --> 02:15:29,344
Who is this?

1072
02:15:30,441 --> 02:15:31,907
I was told to call this number.

1073
02:15:32,410 --> 02:15:34,192
My name is Nemo Nobody.

1074
02:15:36,174 --> 02:15:37,726
Is this some kind of a joke?

1075
02:15:38,291 --> 02:15:40,123
No. No, I ...

1076
02:15:44,981 --> 02:15:46,245
- Operator?
- Yes?

1077
02:15:46,343 --> 02:15:50,238
I'd like the address to
123 581 1321.

1078
02:15:51,235 --> 02:15:52,477
One moment please.

1079
02:15:54,250 --> 02:15:56,450
12358 Alleway Street.

1080
02:16:24,869 --> 02:16:26,542
Hello, Nemo.

1081
02:16:27,089 --> 02:16:29,140
I'm glad you found me.

1082
02:16:29,798 --> 02:16:32,755
All of this must seem
very complicated to you,

1083
02:16:32,810 --> 02:16:35,303
but it's simpler than you think.

1084
02:16:35,876 --> 02:16:38,210
Careful with the chair.
It is damaged.

1085
02:16:44,883 --> 02:16:48,100
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

1086
02:16:50,254 --> 02:16:52,330
I should have
warned you earlier but ...

1087
02:16:52,569 --> 02:16:55,179
I couldn't
because of the transcript.

1088
02:16:55,404 --> 02:16:56,403
The transcript?

1089
02:16:57,019 --> 02:17:00,251
The text of our conversation!

1090
02:17:02,576 --> 02:17:05,474
- You can you hear me!
- What you are living now ...

1091
02:17:06,331 --> 02:17:07,808
is the past.

1092
02:17:08,934 --> 02:17:10,691
At least, for me.

1093
02:17:12,648 --> 02:17:14,051
I am you ...

1094
02:17:15,012 --> 02:17:17,537
70 years older.

1095
02:17:19,208 --> 02:17:23,300
Everything you say, I said
myself when I was young.

1096
02:17:23,513 --> 02:17:27,165
I only had to transcribe
our conversation.

1097
02:17:27,912 --> 02:17:30,219
It's all written right here.

1098
02:17:30,278 --> 02:17:31,785
- I can't ...
- Believe it?

1099
02:17:34,053 --> 02:17:35,436
For me ...

1100
02:17:36,277 --> 02:17:38,482
time is inverted.

1101
02:17:39,198 --> 02:17:41,758
I start at the end of the story ...

1102
02:17:41,759 --> 02:17:43,734
and go toward the beginning.

1103
02:17:44,640 --> 02:17:46,238
I don't understand.

1104
02:17:46,273 --> 02:17:47,873
In this life here,

1105
02:17:48,607 --> 02:17:50,763
you don't exist.

1106
02:17:50,763 --> 02:17:52,579
I don't know why...

1107
02:17:52,998 --> 02:17:55,224
Only the Architect knows.

1108
02:17:56,862 --> 02:17:57,854
The Architect?

1109
02:17:59,009 --> 02:18:00,356
The child ...

1110
02:18:01,380 --> 02:18:04,144
The one running after the train.

1111
02:18:05,881 --> 02:18:08,601
Maybe your parents never met.

1112
02:18:12,869 --> 02:18:17,721
Maybe your father died
in a sledging accident.

1113
02:18:19,431 --> 02:18:21,705
Maybe you were one
of the vast majority ...

1114
02:18:21,763 --> 02:18:26,488
of those whose genetic code did 
not reach its final destination.

1115
02:18:29,902 --> 02:18:31,458
Maybe when she died ...

1116
02:18:32,411 --> 02:18:34,088
A prehistoric woman ...

1117
02:18:34,336 --> 02:18:38,328
She rolled off the line of 
heritance to which you belong.

1118
02:18:39,693 --> 02:18:41,226
So for this world ...

1119
02:18:44,219 --> 02:18:46,487
You don't exist.

1120
02:18:47,987 --> 02:18:50,940
If the Anna's 
calculations are correct,

1121
02:18:51,653 --> 02:18:58,262
you need to stay alive
until 2092, February 12.

1122
02:18:59,175 --> 02:19:02,008
5:50 AM.

1123
02:19:34,529 --> 02:19:36,480
I'm sorry, I don't know how long
we haven't been recording.

1124
02:19:37,079 --> 02:19:39,469
I have to submit my story
by tomorrow morning.

1125
02:19:41,909 --> 02:19:44,179
Everything that you say
is contradictory.

1126
02:19:45,690 --> 02:19:49,252
You can't have been in one place
and another at the same time.

1127
02:19:50,101 --> 02:19:54,291
You mean to say we 
have to make choices?

1128
02:19:54,768 --> 02:19:56,335
Of all those lives, which one ...

1129
02:19:57,788 --> 02:19:59,164
Which one is the right one?

1130
02:20:00,121 --> 02:20:03,808
Each of these lives
is the right one.

1131
02:20:05,431 --> 02:20:10,116
Every path is the right path.

1132
02:20:13,682 --> 02:20:17,981
"Everything could have been
anything else ...

1133
02:20:19,414 --> 02:20:23,951
and it would have just
as much meaning."

1134
02:20:26,136 --> 02:20:28,529
Tennessee Williams.

1135
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:32,536
You're too young for that.

1136
02:20:32,899 --> 02:20:34,536
You can't be dead
and still be here.

1137
02:20:36,176 --> 02:20:37,279
You can't not exist.

1138
02:20:43,957 --> 02:20:45,487
Is there life after death?

1139
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:50,416
After death ...

1140
02:20:53,997 --> 02:20:59,966
How can you be so 
sure you even exist?

1141
02:21:10,115 --> 02:21:12,820
You don't exist.

1142
02:21:14,353 --> 02:21:15,956
Neither do I.

1143
02:21:19,126 --> 02:21:25,401
We only live in the imagination
of a nine year old child.

1144
02:21:26,217 --> 02:21:30,455
We are imagined by a 
nine year old child,

1145
02:21:31,380 --> 02:21:34,314
faced with an 
impossible choice.

1146
02:21:44,051 --> 02:21:45,416
Run! Run!

1147
02:21:51,672 --> 02:21:52,875
Nemo!

1148
02:21:58,496 --> 02:21:59,936
Run!

1149
02:22:04,845 --> 02:22:05,948
Run, Nemo!

1150
02:22:08,911 --> 02:22:10,219
Nemo!

1151
02:22:19,043 --> 02:22:20,188
I love you.

1152
02:22:21,024 --> 02:22:22,024
Anna!

1153
02:22:35,173 --> 02:22:36,173
Nemo!

1154
02:22:45,788 --> 02:22:47,356
You're the one I love.

1155
02:23:03,305 --> 02:23:04,467
In chess,

1156
02:23:06,856 --> 02:23:09,572
it's called Zugzwang,

1157
02:23:11,140 --> 02:23:13,535
when the only viable move

1158
02:23:19,031 --> 02:23:21,065
is not to move.

1159
02:23:30,948 --> 02:23:32,488
Come see.

1160
02:23:56,218 --> 02:23:57,036
It's the sea.

1161
02:23:58,053 --> 02:24:01,020
The child is taking it apart.

1162
02:24:02,385 --> 02:24:04,641
He doesn't need it anymore.

1163
02:24:05,860 --> 02:24:09,635
Before, he was unable
to make a choice ...

1164
02:24:10,551 --> 02:24:12,992
'cause he didn't know
what would happen.

1165
02:24:13,790 --> 02:24:16,615
Now that he knows
what will happen,

1166
02:24:18,763 --> 02:24:21,364
he is unable to make a choice.

1167
02:25:27,032 --> 02:25:28,672
Thank you, thank you!

1168
02:25:29,124 --> 02:25:29,935
Thank you.

1169
02:26:06,419 --> 02:26:12,028
This is the most beautiful 
day of my life.

1170
02:26:21,253 --> 02:26:21,782
Anna.

1171
02:26:25,913 --> 02:26:26,869
Anna.
