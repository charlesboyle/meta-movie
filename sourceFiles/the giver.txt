1
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,600
FROM THE ASHES OF THE RUIN,
THE COMMUNITIES WERE BUILT.

2
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:32,430
PROTECTED BY THE BOUNDARY.

3
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,660
ALL MEMORIES OF
THE PAST WERE ERASED.

4
00:00:41,514 --> 00:00:45,092
After The Ruin, we started over.

5
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:47,420
Creating a new society.

6
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:50,001
One of true a quality.

7
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,308
Rules were the building
blocks of that qualities.

8
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,838
We learned them as a new children.
Rules like:

9
00:00:56,928 --> 00:01:01,044
"Use precise language",
"Wear your assigned clothing",

10
00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:03,725
- "Take your morning medication."
- Injected.

11
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:08,224
"Obey the curfew."
"Never lie."

12
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:16,402
THE GIVER

13
00:01:16,492 --> 00:01:22,016
My name is Jonas. I don't have
a last name, none of us did.

14
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:26,131
That day, the day
before graduation,

15
00:01:26,321 --> 00:01:29,018
I admitted, I was scared.

16
00:01:29,226 --> 00:01:32,900
Tomorrow we'd be assigned our jobs.
Our purpose.

17
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,772
Seemed everyone knew their already.

18
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:39,789
Not me. I was last.

19
00:01:40,728 --> 00:01:43,595
I always felt that I saw things...

20
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:45,595
Differently.

21
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:48,217
Saw things other people didn't.

22
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:03,182
I never said anything. I
didn't wanna be different.

23
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:05,307
Who would?

24
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,284
Jonas!

25
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,889
I apologize, we're late, like God actually
to come say goodbye the teacher.

26
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,490
I accept your apology.

27
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,137
Asher and Fiona, we've been
friends our whole life.

28
00:02:16,227 --> 00:02:18,681
Asher was the boy who
made everyone laugh.

29
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,771
Fiona... well.

30
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:23,300
She was the girl who
made everybody smile.

31
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,145
If we're listening:
please, please!

32
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:29,073
Do not make me vise Jeff
where Matt has been. Please.

33
00:02:29,094 --> 00:02:31,948
We Lived in a world where
differences were not allowed.

34
00:02:32,038 --> 00:02:37,594
There was no "Popular", no "Fame",
no "Looser" and no "Winners".

35
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:42,175
Our elders eliminated all of that, so
that there is no conflict between us.

36
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:46,747
Fear, pain, envy, hate...

37
00:02:46,837 --> 00:02:49,313
There were words, so much as sounds.

38
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:52,685
Their echoes were gone to
the other side of history.

39
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:58,595
I wonder if I should
apologize for what I did.

40
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:01,290
I let you decide.

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,900
I'm going to miss volunteering here.

42
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,532
Oh No! If ever there is a person
boring to work in a Nurturing Center.

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,442
I could be surprise, right?

44
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,565
Jonas, if you had to guess, of all
positions the Elders picked for me...

45
00:03:15,702 --> 00:03:17,597
Nurturing Center.

46
00:03:18,518 --> 00:03:21,679
Welcome to the Nurturing Center.

47
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:33,289
- I got this. I got this. Think Heaven.
- Come on. Come on. - Think Heaven.

48
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:38,825
We win! Or you
might be the champion!

49
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:40,356
- Which one is the heavier?
- Mine.

50
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:41,611
Asher!

51
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:46,807
- I rather think Fiona put her
finger on the scale! - I did not!

52
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,266
Oh, this Little guy didn't
qualify for tomorrow's ceremony.

53
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:58,921
It's just not strong enough to
be assigned to a family here.

54
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:01,327
He looks so unhappy...

55
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:07,081
It's okay, Jonas,
you can open it.

56
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:13,065
Oh. Hey! It's Jonas.

57
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,005
Here Let me.

58
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:19,218
There you go, there you go...

59
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:21,761
- Some people laugh at it.
- Laugh is not fair!

60
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:23,459
Be strong, Gabriel!

61
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,099
Dad, you looked at his name?
Is not it against the rules?

62
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:29,046
Yeah, It is...

63
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:32,418
I just thought having a
name would help him grow.

64
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:35,361
I whispered to him so no one can hear.

65
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:38,622
Sometimes I say "Gabe".

66
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:42,473
It's usually anxious,
I thought that if I hear...

67
00:04:42,805 --> 00:04:44,805
- Are you okay?
- Hmm...

68
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,589
Yeah, I'm fine.

69
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:49,799
So the old man turns to Elder and says,
"Do you know who I am?"

70
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:51,806
And the Elder says,
"Sir, I know you're old,

71
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:53,694
but that is not
the excuse for being prideful."

72
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:57,650
Then the old man says, "No,
really, I am asking: who am I"?

73
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:00,675
I don't get it...

74
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:03,900
"Who am I".
Like he forgot who he was.

75
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,118
Okay, but what if the joke it's
better than the old man said...

76
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:09,490
So: one... two...

77
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:10,824
Three!

78
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:16,769
- Aren't we graduates now?
- We do it every time, come on!

79
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:18,485
One, two, three...!

80
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:21,075
There you go...

81
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:28,533
So... I guess this is it.
Last night of our childhood.

82
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:30,608
I guess everything is
gonna be different.

83
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:34,171
No, tomorrow, the only thing
that changes is what we do.

84
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:35,976
Does not change what we are.

85
00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:38,369
- Good question. Who are we?
- Friends.

86
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,888
- Friends forever.
- Yes.

87
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:42,286
Even when you both
designed be birth mothers.

88
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,022
I guess, We'll find out tomorrow, right?

89
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:50,295
Citizens are reminded that the evening
creation will ending in 13 minutes.

90
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:51,877
Thank you.

91
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:54,578
Well did need to be rehabilitated.

92
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:58,028
I know he was Lily's teacher,
but what was I supposed to do?

93
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:01,418
I feel...

94
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:03,788
disappointment.

95
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:06,693
- What was elder's decision?
- Released to elsewhere.

96
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:10,060
Can I released elsewhere, Mother?
Even just for one day...?

97
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,340
No you are to young, Lily-billy.

98
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,340
Jonas... your turn for feelings.

99
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:22,830
Well, I guess some sort of...

100
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:24,893
Terrified.

101
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:27,300
Precision of language.

102
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:29,885
I mean anxious.

103
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:33,564
When you are about to graduate
you, did you ever feel...

104
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:35,559
that there was no
position meant for you?

105
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,174
They have been watching you
since you were even a child.

106
00:06:38,404 --> 00:06:40,030
The Elders are never wrong.

107
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:44,698
You will find your place.

108
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:52,202
Welcome, citizens, to the
annual ceremony of advancement.

109
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:54,544
Please, standby for a transmission.

110
00:06:57,712 --> 00:07:01,401
- Good morning, Community.
- Good morning, Chief Elder...

111
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,151
I apologize for my remote attendance.

112
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:06,269
We accept your apology.

113
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:09,825
I can't be at every
ceremony - in person.

114
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:14,409
But here's the secret: you
are my favorite community.

115
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:20,469
However, because we do not lie, I readly
admit I said that to every community.

116
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:23,866
Beginnings...

117
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:29,227
From disorder and chaos, from
great suffering, great pain...

118
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:34,224
from confusion, and envy and hatred...

119
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:37,786
came a solution: communities.

120
00:07:37,943 --> 00:07:40,363
Beautiful places,

121
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:44,337
where disorder became harmony.

122
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:49,020
Thank you. Let me get through it.

123
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:52,090
Oh, fine...

124
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,576
It begins The ceremony.

125
00:07:56,545 --> 00:08:00,018
Ceremony of the release to Elsewhere.

126
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:03,804
Honoring elderly citizens
who have devoted their work

127
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:06,976
to the beauty and harmony
of our beloved community.

128
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:11,360
And now ready for a joys
retirement elsewhere.

129

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,056
Proudly and genewed by our
esteemed geneticists...

132
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:21,226

Now these babies will join
their assigned family units.

134

Reaching their halfway
marks towards graduation

135
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,653

136
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:37,457
the symbol of their developing
independence and responsibility.

137

00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:19,957
Jonas has not been assigned a
position, Jonas has been selected.

177
00:11:19,977 --> 00:11:24,224
We are not hasty this time, and we
could not afford another failure.

178
00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:29,555
Jonas posses all four attributes.

179
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:34,839
Intelligence, integrity,
courage and one I name, but...

180
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:38,610
I can not describe: the
capacity to see beyond.

181
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,757
But I must warn you: your
training involves pain.

182
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:46,331
Pain far beyond anything we known.

183
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:48,684
Are you strong enough?

184
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,832
Do we think Jonas is brave enough?

185
00:11:56,416 --> 00:12:01,816
Jonas, you have been selected as
our next Receiver of memories.

186
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:03,926
Thank you for your childhood.

187
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:06,647
Jonas...

188
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,871
Jonas, Jonas...

189
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:39,482
- Help me up, please. - Okay.
This leg, yup. That one. You got it.

190
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:42,579
- Sit back, Sit back...
- Is Jonas now more powerful than you?

191
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:44,712
What is the Chief Elder mean,
when she said:

192
00:12:44,742 --> 00:12:46,373
"We can not afford
another failure"?

193
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:49,752
- Well, ten years ago, the receiver...
- We can not speak of it.

194
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:51,622
You've been greatly honored.

195
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:54,701
- You got it. Go, go!
- I can do it.

196
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:56,481
We should probably catch Lily.

197
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:58,291
- Good! Good, Lily!
- I can ride!

198
00:13:00,935 --> 00:13:04,518
Receiver of memory. Five rules.

199
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,631
One: Report directly to the
receiver of memory for training.

200
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:13,677
After training, return
immediately to your dwelling.

201
00:13:14,647 --> 00:13:20,488
Two, From this moment, you are exempt
from all rules governing rudeness.

202
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:22,819
You may ask any questions.

203
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:27,890
Three, beside from your daily injection,
you may not receive other medicines.

204
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,887
Especially those for pain.

205
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:33,460
Injectat. S752.

206
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:38,597
Four, you may not discuss
your training with anyone.

207
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:41,510
Ever.

208
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,267
- Your look so important...
- I don't know...?

209
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:47,815
- Stick out? - Oh, yeah,
there is only one receiver of memory.

210
00:13:47,836 --> 00:13:49,145
Two.

211
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:52,638
What have they said? That "You
have the capacity to see beyond"?

212
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:54,116
The...

213
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:56,559
Can't wait to hear every single detail!

214
00:13:56,672 --> 00:14:00,061
Five: you may lie.

215
00:14:05,673 --> 00:14:09,894
Asher and I, we used to dare each
other to get closed to his place.

216
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:12,857
It was built right on the edge.

217
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,965
We all heard of people
getting lost on edge.

218
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,979
Never to be seen again.

219
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:20,370
And yet... here I was.

220
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:24,124
Being Told that I have to
get close to it every day.

221
00:14:24,144 --> 00:14:26,273
For the rest of my life.

222
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:39,244
Welcome.

223
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,779
Uhm, Hi. I'm Jonas...

224
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,022
Please raise at the sensor.

225
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,898
Welcome, Receiver of Memories.

226
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:37,270
They're called Books.

227
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,065
Your Books.

228
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:41,377
- My name is...
- I know who you are.

229
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:44,092
Of Course, I apologize.

230
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:48,831
"I apologized"...?

231
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:50,985
Stop saying that.

232
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:55,961
"I apologized"... don't apologize to me.

233
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,886
Never again, not here.

234
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:04,337
We haven't time to "apologize".

235
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:08,137
That's an automatic pleasantry.
It does not mean anything.

236
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:11,118
I apologise... I'm sorry. I mean...

237
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,485
We are here for only one purpose.

238
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:17,453
Simply stated...

239
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:20,222
Although the words are
really simple at all...

240
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:24,644
I'll transmits you all the
memories that hold within me.

241
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,791
Memories of the past.

242
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:29,960
I'd be very interested to
learn about your life.

243
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,862
No, no. Not..

244
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:34,194
My life.

245
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:37,311
You'll learn the secret
history of the world!

246
00:16:37,393 --> 00:16:41,118
Before me, before you, the
generations back and back and back.

247
00:16:41,624 --> 00:16:44,174
When things were different:
when there is more.

248
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:45,661
"More"...?

249
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:47,670
Get... Chair.

250
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:52,360
You see, no one in our community
has any memory of the past.

251
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,084
Only me.

252
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:58,629
When elders need a guide
beyond there experience,

253
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:01,617
I provide wisdom, that is now your role.

254
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:05,934
To Provide guidance in the present,
using the memories of the past.

255
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:07,750
Come closer.

256
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:13,943
Where to begin...?

257
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:17,915
Come closer.

258
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,353
Closer.

259
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:31,075
There is no way for me to prepare
you for what I'm going to do now.

260
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:33,677
It's gonna take
comfort to knowing...

261
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:37,086
You're completely helpless.

262
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,130
If any of this proof too much
for you, tell me immediately.

263
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,919
I just have...

264
00:19:17,518 --> 00:19:21,746
Silent Night...

265
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:26,078
Holy time...

266
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:27,994
All sleep...

267
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,056
That was... That...

268
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:37,508
- How that happened?
- What you mean 'how'? It happened.

269
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:39,909
- But that's impossible!
- And yet, it happened.

270
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:41,708
But... why?

271
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:43,575
Why don't we have...

272
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:44,938
That...

273
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:47,775
Thing...

274
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:52,040
Come on... the memories gave
you the words, not "thing"...

275
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,968
- "Sledge"!
- Sledge.

276
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:55,275
And the...

277
00:19:57,007 --> 00:19:59,186
- Snow.
- Snow...

278
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:04,002
- But my parents haven't been... Did
you...? - No... It's a distinct memory.

279
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:05,775
Simply stated...

280
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:09,295
There is no snow because
of climate control.

281
00:20:09,852 --> 00:20:12,158
But why all people do
not know about them?

282
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:14,832
What's so dangerous in
the memory of a sledge?

283
00:20:14,852 --> 00:20:16,735
What's so dangerous...?

284
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,441
For sledge you need snow,

285
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:24,145
Snow is cold, cold destroys crops...

286
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:26,679
which means farmers could not farm.

287
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:30,110
Unpredictable weather, the
hills, the mountains...

288
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:32,942
made it difficult to transport of food.

289
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:36,539
And we had hunger, starvation, famine...

290
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:40,286
Everything is connected,
everything is balance.

291
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:42,902
Where there is good,
there is always bad.

292
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:44,744
- The two...
- Show me more!

293
00:20:47,844 --> 00:20:49,787
Let's go for a walk.

294
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:54,755
A real one, with our legs.

295
00:20:55,225 --> 00:20:59,102
At The bottom of hill...
I saw something.

296
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,130
Like a place.

297
00:21:02,402 --> 00:21:04,198
- "Home".
- Home. Yes.

298
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:05,689
"Home"? Like a dwelling?

299
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,281
- Mr. Receiver...
- Good morning!

300
00:21:07,302 --> 00:21:12,784
No... It's different.
A dwelling is not a "home".

301
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:15,738
"Home" means more.

302
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:21,687
Your instructions said
I can lie, do you lie?

303
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:26,435
A, all the time! Mostly
for personal amusement.

304
00:21:26,873 --> 00:21:29,104
But I won't lie to you.

305
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:31,896
How do I know that's not a lie?

306
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:38,726
There was someone else before me.

307
00:21:39,283 --> 00:21:41,098
What happened to them?

308
00:21:46,404 --> 00:21:48,066
One more question!

309
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,091
If I am now the receiver,
what is that make you?

310
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:54,067
Well. That must make me...

311
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:55,839
The Giver.

312
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:06,693
So how was it?

313
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:10,197
- It was good.
- What you do?

314
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,911
- We just talked.
- What else?

315
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:17,563
That's It.

316
00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:20,046
- You seem different.
- How do you mean?

317
00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:24,364
- I see him tomorrow.
- He cancel them, no matter what I do.

318
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:28,098
- And you said that you look
after it. - I know, I said.

319
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:31,201
- I apologize.
- I accept your apology.

320
00:22:31,314 --> 00:22:33,402
- Thank you, Dinah.
- Thank you.

321
00:22:37,324 --> 00:22:40,784
- Gabriel! - How did Jonas
know the child's name?

322
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:45,181
- Jonas met Gabriel the other day.
- It's so cute!

323
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:49,057
Would you like to issue me a
warning, director of Justice?

324
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:52,745
Just for a while, Mother,
till little guy catch up us.

325
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:55,722
I think we all agree that
you will sleep in my room.

326
00:22:56,048 --> 00:22:59,450
- Only if the Elders says it's okay.
- They will.

327
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,004
Yeah...

328
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:03,882
Lily, give me a comfort object.

329
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:06,862
Come on, Lily, it's time for bed.

330
00:23:07,288 --> 00:23:09,996
- Look at this...
- Bye, baby!

331
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:13,385
This is a mythical
creature called "hippo."

332
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:18,952
And it's incredibly fast, because
it has two, three, four, five legs!

333
00:23:20,402 --> 00:23:21,901
We had the same mark.

334
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:23,137
And it's very strong...

335
00:23:23,157 --> 00:23:25,916
They almost did not have
to see his to know.

336
00:23:25,936 --> 00:23:27,484
I felt that.

337
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:31,754
Felt that one day Gabriel
will be chosen too.

338
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,638
...hippo!

339
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:36,035
Yeah...!

340
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:52,416
- That's the pain I talked about.
- No... Not even close.

341
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:54,657
- Did you...
- How to face!

342
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:58,715
- Why was that thing alive...?
- Don't skip your head.

343
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:01,617
- Did you notice anything about them?
- Yes: It hurt.

344
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:03,797
No, any quality.

345
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,908
Well Maybe...

346
00:24:08,353 --> 00:24:11,426
I think I saw it in friend Fiona's hair.

347
00:24:12,883 --> 00:24:15,257
My twist is yellow.

348
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:18,411
If you thought the slab special...

349
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:10,272
It's...

350
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:14,094
"Red"!

351
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:17,458
- Just like her hair...
- Yes.

352
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:21,373
There are red, green, blue...
Many different colours.

353
00:25:21,843 --> 00:25:24,345
You'll see them all in time.

354
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,934
When our people have chose to...
to away with all of them...

355
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:32,919
Color, race, religion...

356
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:35,027
They created sameness.

357
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:38,179
If we were different,
we could be envious...

358
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:41,416
angry, reasonful...

359
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:43,884
consumed of hatred.

360
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,051
We need sameness.

361
00:25:47,702 --> 00:25:50,874
- Not you think?
- Oh, I completely agree!

362
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:53,348
And still...

363
00:25:54,105 --> 00:25:55,744
also...

364
00:25:55,951 --> 00:25:57,739
It's beautiful.

365
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,375
We always said that
Elsewhere is so far-away.

366
00:26:07,188 --> 00:26:08,890
But it wasn't.

367
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:11,220
It was right there.

368
00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:14,553
Close enough to touch.

369
00:26:15,547 --> 00:26:18,521
Jonas, have you fallen...?

370
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:22,620
- Do you need immediate help?
- No, I.. I was just...

371
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:25,324
What's going on with you?

372
00:26:25,624 --> 00:26:27,241
Nothing's going on with me.

373
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:30,829
No you are right, it's totally normal to
lie in the grass and stare at the sky.

374
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:32,675
No, I was just...

375
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:36,162
You are seeing something,
aren't you?

376
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:42,759
Can you tell me?

377
00:26:49,322 --> 00:26:51,175
Give me your hands.

378
00:27:04,754 --> 00:27:06,405
What do you see?

379
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:11,462
- Oh my goodness...
- You see it?

380
00:27:12,094 --> 00:27:13,672
Yes.

381
00:27:14,534 --> 00:27:16,121
It's water.

382
00:27:16,878 --> 00:27:18,840
Come on, concentrate.

383
00:27:25,297 --> 00:27:26,665
Uhm Hi!

384
00:27:27,222 --> 00:27:30,327
Jonas was just teaching
me about his training.

385
00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:32,753
As you can see,
it's "incredibly interesting".

386
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:34,589
It can't be as great as mine.

387
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:36,741
Can't have your minds blow...?

388
00:27:41,475 --> 00:27:44,496
- Whoa! Do you know how to fly those?
- Absolutely!

389
00:27:44,516 --> 00:27:47,351
Short off... I'm learning.

390
00:27:49,246 --> 00:27:52,676
When I'm flying, looking
down at everything...

391
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:57,722
- It's like I'm seeing things for the first
time. - You get to fly into elsewhere?

392
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,963
Oh, yeah!

393
00:27:58,983 --> 00:28:01,069
Once, when I was
looking at that myst...

394
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,646
Even they told us that there
is nothing close to the edge,

395
00:28:04,727 --> 00:28:07,300
I thought I saw a tree
out there somewhere.

396
00:28:09,294 --> 00:28:12,689
Don't get too excited, I've
actually seen elsewhere.

397
00:28:12,802 --> 00:28:16,569
Just mostly our farm rocks
that kind of stuff.

398
00:28:16,645 --> 00:28:18,335
What's weird about them?

399
00:28:18,635 --> 00:28:22,743
There is these two huge rocks
leaning against each other

400
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:25,646
making a kind of... triangle.

401
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,636
Hey, it's kind like our triangle!

402
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:30,012
- What's past their?
- Don't know.

403
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:32,079
And Now lot of fly past there.

404
00:28:34,054 --> 00:28:35,947
So many secrets...

405
00:28:36,154 --> 00:28:37,963
So what are your secrets?

406
00:28:38,664 --> 00:28:40,000
A... nothing.

407
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:43,361
What do you mean, "Oh, nothing"?
You are receiver of memories.

408
00:28:47,705 --> 00:28:49,447
Maybe I can show you.

409
00:28:50,317 --> 00:28:52,692
- Okay. Grab a tray.
- What...?

410
00:28:52,942 --> 00:28:55,634
Bring it over the solar plate, come on!

411
00:28:55,797 --> 00:28:58,784
Hey this might seem little
funny, but you gotta trust me.

412
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,585
Okay. Sit down on the tray.

413
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:05,132
Careful...

414
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,152
- Whoa! You're not gonna...
- What are you scared?

415
00:29:07,172 --> 00:29:10,464
I'm scared of anything. I was Just..

416
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:14,228
- It's against the rules, Jonas.
- Since do you care about the rules?

417
00:29:17,073 --> 00:29:19,334
Actually I have auxiliary training.

418
00:29:19,978 --> 00:29:21,553
I'll See you guys.

419
00:29:23,246 --> 00:29:27,523
Look who grew up...
Lucky for you I haven't.

420
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:35,742
Okay...? Now go!

421
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:05,946
Put your heels down, Slow down!

422
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:23,826
I think your training may
be more funnier than mine.

423
00:30:23,846 --> 00:30:26,872
Please, Standby for a
Community announcement.

424
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:29,364
Citizens are reminded that it is rude

425
00:30:29,384 --> 00:30:33,148
to touch community members
outside of your family unit.

426
00:30:33,168 --> 00:30:34,785
Thank you.

427
00:30:37,048 --> 00:30:40,574
He is punctual. He is inquisitive.

428
00:30:40,594 --> 00:30:43,959
- How inquisitive?
- He's interested in his position.

429
00:30:44,047 --> 00:30:46,270
Then why is he breaking the rules?

430
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:51,431
He has been observed trying to share his
training with his former classmate.

431
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,703
That always happens.

432
00:30:54,342 --> 00:30:56,979
But it's an impossible experiment.

433
00:30:57,391 --> 00:31:01,556
Even I tried to share of the memories
back when I was in training.

434
00:31:01,757 --> 00:31:03,582
If you remember...

435
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:07,028
So... forget about it.

436
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,101
I don't tell you what to do in
your position, so don't tell me.

437
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:14,500
I apologise, but...

438
00:31:14,613 --> 00:31:18,766
- Isn't that is happening now?
- Your apology is accepted, but...

439
00:31:18,796 --> 00:31:21,933
You're being careless.
You are moving too fast,

440
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,266
we both know what happened
ten years ago with the girl.

441
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:28,731
That girl had a name.

442
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:33,923
You think I do not
remember her name?

443
00:31:34,218 --> 00:31:37,140
I know I feel the loss.

444
00:31:47,421 --> 00:31:50,775
The boy must hold in the pain.

445
00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:55,181
Don't fail us again.

446
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:07,895
Want me to read all these?

447
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,464
Uh, What's this...?

448
00:32:10,484 --> 00:32:15,334
"One day you should meet a boy who
answers to the name of Jonas."

449
00:32:16,341 --> 00:32:19,156
"He should be the most
powerful of all receivers".

450
00:32:19,244 --> 00:32:22,030
- Wait: that says...?
- Do not be gullible.

451
00:32:26,604 --> 00:32:28,439
"Plan for sameness."

452
00:32:28,528 --> 00:32:31,801
- Another trick?
- Actually, no.

453
00:32:34,676 --> 00:32:37,030
It's some kind of... Map.

454
00:32:37,362 --> 00:32:41,142
Triangle of Rocks! It's true,
my friend Asher actually saw it!

455
00:32:41,473 --> 00:32:44,845
Look at all this towers...
What are they for?

456
00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:47,390
How could your friend saw
the Triangle of Rocks?

457
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,081
He is a pilot, he told me, he saw it.

458
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:54,878
What's past that? Past the "outer
edge, boundary of Memories"?

459
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:57,290
A mystery.

460
00:32:57,678 --> 00:32:59,745
"Boundary Memories",
that have they built

461
00:32:59,775 --> 00:33:02,143
so the memories only
stay within you and me?

462
00:33:02,163 --> 00:33:04,351
- Let's move on.
- Wait!

463
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,765
That boundary is meant
to keep the memories in.

464
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:11,367
So, if a receiver crosses it, is that
means the memories get set free?

465
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:15,836
Perhaps... perhaps
if you and I crossed it,

466
00:33:15,866 --> 00:33:18,534
everyone could feel
those memories again.

467
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,708
So what am I seeing today?

468
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,544
Nothing.

469
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:28,478
You are seeing nothing today.

470
00:33:35,753 --> 00:33:38,361
We already covered "seeing beyond".

471
00:33:39,224 --> 00:33:42,197
There is also such a
thing "hearing beyond".

472
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:46,317
A table...? All the food
would slip on the floor.

473
00:33:48,749 --> 00:33:51,723
Now don't judge me...

474
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:54,166
I'm not very good.

475
00:33:54,892 --> 00:33:57,741
Even though I had a very good teacher.

476
00:34:08,817 --> 00:34:10,523
Music...

477
00:34:12,186 --> 00:34:15,626
Well... the music when I
press the right keys.

478
00:34:34,353 --> 00:34:39,597
Just Like music, there's something
else you can see with your eyes.

479
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:44,245
Something lies deep inside you.

480
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,020
Something...

481
00:34:46,102 --> 00:34:49,293
This morning injections take away.

482
00:34:49,438 --> 00:34:52,064
I thought injections are for our health.

483
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,254
Not, they remove something.

484
00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:55,911
What?

485
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:58,256
Emotions!

486
00:35:00,425 --> 00:35:02,202
You mean my feelings...?

487
00:35:03,783 --> 00:35:06,586
Feelings are just fleeded

488
00:35:06,725 --> 00:35:08,459
on the surface.

489
00:35:09,091 --> 00:35:12,990
But emotions they are very deep...

490
00:35:13,122 --> 00:35:16,082
Primal... they linger

491
00:35:17,507 --> 00:35:19,176
and join us...

492
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:24,081
You might not understand where
you are or what's happening.

493
00:35:24,145 --> 00:35:26,883
But don't think about
what you are seeing.

494
00:35:27,102 --> 00:35:28,844
Listen!

495
00:35:30,744 --> 00:35:33,949
Listen to what's calling from inside.

496
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:47,405
Antonio!

497
00:35:48,072 --> 00:35:50,436
What beautiful wedding!

498
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:21,833
Why would anyone want
to get rid of this?

499
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,834
Good question...

500
00:36:29,758 --> 00:36:32,532
- What are you doing...?
- Take my hands!

501
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:34,302
Ready?

502
00:36:37,126 --> 00:36:38,957
Are you ready for the fast part?

503
00:36:43,132 --> 00:36:44,637
Come back!

504
00:36:44,657 --> 00:36:46,896
- Spin!
- What are you doing with her?

505
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:49,202
Jonas says it's called dancing.

506
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,122
Please, Standby for a transmission.

507
00:36:56,078 --> 00:37:00,460
- I apologize for my intervention.
- We accept your apology.

508
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:04,444
- I just wanted to say Hello.
- Hello.

509
00:37:04,626 --> 00:37:07,503
- I am Lily.
- Yes, I know.

510
00:37:07,554 --> 00:37:09,976
You are nine now, isn't it right?

511
00:37:10,177 --> 00:37:14,538
Lily, I think it's... time for school.
Now we are going.

512
00:37:14,621 --> 00:37:16,117
Hello, Jonas.

513
00:37:16,536 --> 00:37:19,198
- Hello.
- How's your training?

514
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,468
Injected.

515
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:24,260
- Fine.
- I'm concerned about the receiver.

516
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:29,022
- Many years ago there was an incident.
- What kind of incident?

517
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:34,678
Living alone in a building at
the edge can isolate a person.

518
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,659
I am concerned that the receiver...
is being reckless.

519
00:37:39,191 --> 00:37:41,785
Are you being properly prepared?

520
00:37:42,086 --> 00:37:44,929
- I think so.
- You are focused?

521
00:37:46,073 --> 00:37:49,759
Perhaps you are spending too much time
with friends from your childhood?

522
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:54,059
- I'm focused. - Jonas! What do
you in the receiver, actually do?

523
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,977
- My rules say not allow to share.
- She is the Elder-chief.

524
00:37:58,165 --> 00:38:00,500
Jonas she only wants to help.

525
00:38:00,782 --> 00:38:02,398
You are right.

526
00:38:03,636 --> 00:38:06,797
But you can't tell the
receiver I told you.

527
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:08,826
You have my word.

528
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:12,366
We sit on chairs and
don't talk all day long.

529
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:17,824
And when the time is up, I came back
here and in the morning do all it again.

530
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:23,012
I apologize, but I'm late.

531
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:25,628
Your apology is accepted.

532
00:38:27,153 --> 00:38:28,846
Goodbye Mother.

533
00:38:32,195 --> 00:38:33,532
Injected.

534
00:38:33,764 --> 00:38:35,442
He is not usually like this.

535
00:38:35,474 --> 00:38:38,639
I'm surprised you're not
more worried about him.

536
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,800
Were he my responsibility...

537
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:44,790
I would be.

538
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,864
We had been told that Elder-chief knew
everything. Things no buddy else did.

539
00:38:50,313 --> 00:38:53,722
But I had learned that knowing
of what something is...

540
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:57,245
It's not the same as knowing
how something feel.

541
00:39:01,892 --> 00:39:05,840
You could be the best, the last
one at top of the mountain...

542
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,487
Gasping for air, having survived...

543
00:39:08,507 --> 00:39:10,174
and be alone.

544
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:11,749
Be curious.

545
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:14,976
I got lost... to good king=d of lost!

546
00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:19,273
I saw sites and heard sounds,
I had no words to describe.

547
00:39:19,294 --> 00:39:21,830
Faces with different colored skins.

548
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:23,762
I feel so alive...

549
00:39:23,782 --> 00:39:25,607
Is this forbidden?

550
00:39:25,627 --> 00:39:28,351
I did not know what to
think, what to believe.

551
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:31,522
"Have faith", The Giver told me.

552
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,343
He said: "Faith, that
was seeing beyond."

553
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:39,297
He compared it to the wind:
something felt but not seen.

554
00:39:39,317 --> 00:39:40,917
Don't accept.

555
00:39:41,431 --> 00:39:45,475
What is the truth just because it's
coming from someone you respect.

556
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:48,477
I feel completely stupid,
a weird feeling.

557
00:39:48,497 --> 00:39:50,586
- Fucking weird...
- Thing goes in your hand.

558
00:39:50,942 --> 00:39:55,992
Memories are not just about the
past, they determine our future.

559
00:39:56,474 --> 00:40:00,677
You can change things,
you can make things better.

560
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:06,477
It was life..

561
00:40:07,226 --> 00:40:09,792
It just Seemed more complete.

562
00:40:11,193 --> 00:40:15,398
The more I experienced,
the more I wanted.

563
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,754
Once there were and other living beings.

564
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,891
But unlike us

565
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,000
they knew who their
mothers and fathers were.

566
00:40:27,026 --> 00:40:29,135
They had joy...

567
00:40:29,535 --> 00:40:31,374
And they had pain.

568
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:36,246
I can't prepare you for whats going...

569
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,114
No need to warn me every single time...

570
00:40:38,134 --> 00:40:41,783
No, Jonas. You do not understand:
there are tremendous cruelty...

571
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,314
Giver! I'm not a kid anymore. Show me.

572
00:40:54,976 --> 00:40:58,005
That's $ 250,000 ivory.

573
00:40:58,025 --> 00:40:59,962
Come on. Come on!

574
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:03,257
- Put in!
- Again, again.

575
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:09,319
No, stop!

576
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:11,131
Stop!

577
00:41:16,385 --> 00:41:17,973
Stop...

578
00:41:38,394 --> 00:41:39,804
Hey!

579
00:41:39,948 --> 00:41:42,541
Hey, Gabe? Okay, Gabe...

580
00:41:44,278 --> 00:41:47,705
If I tell you a secret, you
promise not to tell anyone?

581
00:41:50,586 --> 00:41:52,404
I'll take that as a "yes."

582
00:41:53,255 --> 00:41:55,574
This comfort object...

583
00:41:55,944 --> 00:41:57,845
is not hippo.

584
00:41:58,838 --> 00:42:03,283
It's an elephant,
and once it was real.

585
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:07,200
And it was beautiful...

586
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:31,367
Citizens are reminded that sleep
period commences in 15 minutes.

587
00:42:31,387 --> 00:42:32,823
Thank you.

588
00:43:20,152 --> 00:43:23,249
It was like a memory,
but Fiona was there.

589
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:24,902
A wait of dream.

590
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:27,363
- A what?
- A "Dream".

591
00:43:27,576 --> 00:43:32,681
A combination of reality, fantasy,
emotions and what you ate for dinner.

592
00:43:37,012 --> 00:43:40,161
You've stopped taking your
injections, isn't you?

593
00:43:44,545 --> 00:43:47,132
Emotion was so strong...

594
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:51,409
And it was the wedding! Everyone all
together laughing and dancing...

595
00:43:51,647 --> 00:43:55,830
The older and the young, the bride and
the groom, there was something there.

596
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,231
But different from what we have.

597
00:43:59,282 --> 00:44:00,865
Yes...

598
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:03,675
We don't have that anymore.

599
00:44:05,282 --> 00:44:07,005
What do you mean by that?

600
00:44:08,343 --> 00:44:12,470
I'm talking about what you
feel for someone else.

601
00:44:13,746 --> 00:44:18,991
And mind can not explain it and
you can't make it go away.

602
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:21,429
- What is it?
- Love.

603
00:44:23,485 --> 00:44:26,289
Its called "Love".

604
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:29,274
Love...

605
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,895
Oh Hi!

606
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:35,251
Hi!

607
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:37,909
So what's new?

608
00:44:40,065 --> 00:44:43,139
- What's new with you?
- What's ever new?

609
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:50,473
- Why are you being weird?
- I'm not.

610
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,239
I'm Just...

611
00:44:52,842 --> 00:44:54,260
Just...

612
00:45:03,209 --> 00:45:05,280
Lad the hippo game!

613
00:45:05,626 --> 00:45:07,181
Hold On!

614
00:45:07,258 --> 00:45:09,196
Father, Do you love me?

615
00:45:09,216 --> 00:45:10,521
Jonas.

616
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,411
Precision of language. Please!

617
00:45:13,649 --> 00:45:15,580
What does "love" mean?

618
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,975
I got him, Lily.

619
00:45:16,995 --> 00:45:21,019
Jonas uses the word so inappropriate
that it no longer has any application.

620
00:45:21,157 --> 00:45:24,260
If you ask, "Do you enjoy me"...

621
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:26,857
The answer is certainly "Yes".

622
00:45:26,951 --> 00:45:30,198
Or Do Mother and I take proud
in your accomplishment...

623
00:45:30,555 --> 00:45:33,694
Of course we do. Do you understand?

624
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:38,870
Yes. I think I finally do.

625
00:45:42,688 --> 00:45:45,227
Hey! Hey.. Gabe...!

626
00:46:02,123 --> 00:46:04,266
I love you, Gabriel...

627
00:46:27,695 --> 00:46:30,758
Giver! You were right, I asked
my family about love and...

628
00:46:30,778 --> 00:46:32,903
get down... get down!

629
00:46:32,966 --> 00:46:34,370
Giver!

630
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:37,464
They are in the trees! There
are in the trees, Robbie!

631
00:46:37,484 --> 00:46:40,030
Get down! Robbie, get down!

632
00:46:40,051 --> 00:46:41,565
Robbie, get down!

633
00:46:41,585 --> 00:46:43,960
Robbie, get down! Stay down!

634
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,702
I didn't see you, man!

635
00:46:45,778 --> 00:46:47,018
You are in the trees!

636
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,426
Stay down!

637
00:46:50,446 --> 00:46:51,983
May Day!

638
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,638
We are under intense shooting!

639
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:01,515
Send help!

640
00:47:02,262 --> 00:47:03,993
Robbie... Robbie!

641
00:47:05,965 --> 00:47:07,362
No...

642
00:47:43,484 --> 00:47:44,825
Jonas...

643
00:47:45,484 --> 00:47:46,855
What...?

644
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:49,645
- I'm sorry Jonas...
- How do people do that?

645
00:47:49,665 --> 00:47:52,055
I didn't mean you to receive that.

646
00:47:52,156 --> 00:47:54,062
Not for years.

647
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:57,236
Don't.. Don't let this
come back to your way.

648
00:47:57,256 --> 00:48:00,735
- I'm not strong enough.
- Of course, not yet. But Jonas...

649
00:48:00,755 --> 00:48:04,591
This what we need to
know, so we can advise!

650
00:48:05,792 --> 00:48:09,070
I can't... I'm sorry, I can't...

651
00:48:09,702 --> 00:48:12,257
- I just can't.
- Jonas!

652
00:48:12,277 --> 00:48:13,693
Jonas!

653
00:48:13,825 --> 00:48:16,340
Jonas, Come back!

654
00:48:16,696 --> 00:48:18,094
Please!

655
00:48:18,114 --> 00:48:20,661
Come back inside, Let me explain it!

656
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:23,735
When you see something like that...
there is no explanation.

657
00:48:23,755 --> 00:48:27,086
Rosemary... Promise me
you come back tomorrow!

658
00:48:27,106 --> 00:48:28,825
Rosemary!

659
00:48:51,198 --> 00:48:54,575
Hey, Jonas! Come on. You are...
Just in time.

660
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:00,040
I did never wanna go back...

661
00:49:00,216 --> 00:49:02,316
I didn't want the wisdom.

662
00:49:02,385 --> 00:49:04,281
I didn't want the pain.

663
00:49:04,851 --> 00:49:07,090
I just wanted my childhood again.

664
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:10,076
Scrap Knees and ball games...

665
00:49:10,351 --> 00:49:12,857
Back then we had played "war".

666
00:49:13,427 --> 00:49:15,612
But the war was real.

667
00:49:15,743 --> 00:49:17,800
The Elders understood that.

668
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,471
They erased it from our world.

669
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,515
Maybe they were right.

670
00:49:38,138 --> 00:49:40,370
- Could you watch over Harry for me?
- Of course.

671
00:49:45,658 --> 00:49:47,314
Hey, what's Wrong?

672
00:49:48,183 --> 00:49:51,027
- Nothing.
- I know you.

673
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,069
- You do, do you?
- Yes...

674
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:57,889
What do you think would happen if
you skip the morning injection?

675
00:49:58,524 --> 00:49:59,902
If you skipped it?

676
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:02,835
Then the sensors would blink and
remind me that I forgot it.

677
00:50:02,855 --> 00:50:04,973
No I don't mean if you forgot, I mean...

678
00:50:04,993 --> 00:50:08,356
What do you think would happen if
you choose not to be injected?

679
00:50:08,782 --> 00:50:10,935
Jonas, I thought something is wrong.

680
00:50:10,973 --> 00:50:13,843
There is something wrong.
Everything is wrong.

681
00:50:13,863 --> 00:50:17,064
I quit. Fiona, I done
being the receiver.

682
00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:20,515
- This Morning, I skip the injection.
- Wait: "You quit"...?

683
00:50:20,536 --> 00:50:22,913
Cut your finger and put
a little blood on this apple.

684
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:25,495
No, you can't quit, if you quit your
position, you get sent to elsewhere.

685
00:50:25,515 --> 00:50:27,560
Leave in the morning,
put the apple over the sensor,

686
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:30,870
- it will find your blood and think it's
your hand. - Stop, you're scaring me.

687
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:33,445
Fiona, you need you to do this,
I need you to feel what I know.

688
00:50:33,465 --> 00:50:34,745
Jonas.

689
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,620
An apple wouldn't even work.

690
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,854
I've been doing it for months,
since worked every single time.

691
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:44,037
Don't quit, you can't leave.

692
00:50:46,462 --> 00:50:49,049
I don't think I can go
back to that place.

693
00:50:53,574 --> 00:50:57,702
- You will, if you want me to do this.
- Okay, fine.

694
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:02,047
But tomorrow, after work,
meet me in the Triangle.

695
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,350
I wanted to share with her.

696
00:51:06,607 --> 00:51:09,363
Not all of it, but good things.

697
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,809
Was I wrong to one that?

698
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:16,617
I thought about her now. All the time.

699
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,900
Hello...? I have something to show you.

700
00:51:52,794 --> 00:51:54,380
Come here!

701
00:51:56,824 --> 00:51:58,471
Who are you?

702
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,715
Come over here and try this.

703
00:52:01,735 --> 00:52:03,134
- Me...?
- Me?

704
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:05,215
Yeah, I wanna teach you.

705
00:52:12,812 --> 00:52:14,616
You've come back.

706
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:18,003
- Where did you learn that?
- From the memories you gave me.

707
00:52:18,142 --> 00:52:20,076
And you can done it quit?

708
00:52:21,269 --> 00:52:22,843
It's beautiful.

709
00:52:22,864 --> 00:52:24,135
Who's that?

710
00:52:24,155 --> 00:52:25,385
This...

711
00:52:25,406 --> 00:52:26,921
is Rosemary.

712
00:52:27,797 --> 00:52:29,734
The previous Receiver.

713
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,311
She is the one that all talk about.

714
00:52:35,847 --> 00:52:37,973
It no longer exists...

715
00:52:39,517 --> 00:52:41,387
Except here.

716
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:43,889
And in my memories.

717
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:51,217
She was in training
only two short months.

718
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:54,541
Look how the fingers move...

719
00:52:54,853 --> 00:52:56,643
Unlike you.

720
00:52:57,394 --> 00:52:59,701
She wanted to experience...

721
00:53:00,466 --> 00:53:02,382
Well, Everything!

722
00:53:02,465 --> 00:53:06,326
I've only give her pleasant
beautiful memories.

723
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:08,648
She fought me...

724
00:53:08,668 --> 00:53:10,362
- Don't protect me!
- No!

725
00:53:10,382 --> 00:53:13,067
Don't show me a map and then
not give me all the memories.

726
00:53:13,129 --> 00:53:14,924
- I thought we're gonna help.
- We will.

727
00:53:14,944 --> 00:53:17,234
- But must move slow.
- Show it to me!

728
00:53:17,751 --> 00:53:19,608
You gave her war?

729
00:53:22,765 --> 00:53:25,719
I gave her the memory of child.

730
00:53:26,419 --> 00:53:29,532
A child taken from her mother.

731
00:53:30,195 --> 00:53:32,328
I gave her loss...

732
00:53:33,316 --> 00:53:35,104
Too soon!

733
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:37,048
You need to gonna hang on this.

734
00:53:37,905 --> 00:53:40,341
The light went from her eyes...

735
00:53:42,367 --> 00:53:45,806
Next morning, without telling me...

736
00:53:46,163 --> 00:53:49,749
She went to Elder-chief
and asked to be released.

737
00:53:51,793 --> 00:53:55,299
So she was released. And
now lives in Elsewhere.

738
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:01,005
Yes, Receiver.

739
00:54:01,025 --> 00:54:03,108
I'd like to see this morning's release.

740
00:54:03,128 --> 00:54:05,325
Thank you for your instructions.

741
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:06,827
Okay...

742
00:54:09,334 --> 00:54:10,821
That's my father!

743
00:54:10,869 --> 00:54:12,289
This one is heavier.

744
00:54:12,322 --> 00:54:14,511
- More twins! Great!
- Watch!

745
00:54:14,531 --> 00:54:16,400
Oh, good...

746
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:18,995
For a moment I thought
that was exactly the same.

747
00:54:19,427 --> 00:54:21,873
- Here we go...
- Then we have a problem!

748
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,804
- Okay...
- Thank you, Dinah.

749
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,204
- Hey new...
- ... possessed stand.

750
00:54:28,372 --> 00:54:30,585
Only one unit less.

751
00:55:00,826 --> 00:55:04,261
Oh, I know it hurts, I know...

752
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:09,885
But you put into a vein, and
the your arms are too tiny.

753
00:55:09,929 --> 00:55:11,719
Almost there...

754
00:55:12,162 --> 00:55:15,150
Okay! It wasn't so bad, was it?

755
00:55:22,105 --> 00:55:23,717
That's death.

756
00:55:23,856 --> 00:55:27,507
- He doesn't know what he is doing.
- "Doesn't know what he is doing"...?

757
00:55:29,169 --> 00:55:32,222
- He killed him!
- But he doesn't know what it means.

758
00:55:32,766 --> 00:55:36,228
Just like you did,
neither did Rosemary.

759
00:55:36,784 --> 00:55:40,742
How can he not see the baby isn't moving?
Doesn't that tell him something is wrong?

760
00:55:40,762 --> 00:55:42,988
The young and the older killed.

761
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:47,211
Your friend, Fiona, she will soon
be trained to release as well.

762
00:55:47,231 --> 00:55:50,749
That's a lie. She would never do that.

763
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:54,480
- If Fiona understood...
- We are the Only one who understand it.

764
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,960
Then it's our fault.

765
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,669
You, me and all the receivers
back and back and back and back.

766
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,607
Perhaps to be a way to show them.

767
00:56:01,727 --> 00:56:04,538
Give them memories so
they can understand!

768
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:06,989
- Yes...
- Because if you can't feel...

769
00:56:08,087 --> 00:56:11,419
- What's the point?
- What... what can you do?

770
00:56:49,295 --> 00:56:52,879
Did it work? I don't know how long it
takes for the injection to leave you,

771
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,996
- but there a day was long enough...
- Why I do this, Jonas?

772
00:56:56,465 --> 00:56:59,385
On the walk here I was thinking
of how was I scold you.

773
00:56:59,405 --> 00:57:00,986
How I was say always,

774
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:04,254
fine for you to break the rules,
because you are chosen...

775
00:57:04,274 --> 00:57:08,251
When I thought about
telling you, I just I...

776
00:57:08,895 --> 00:57:11,554
I began to think about you.

777
00:57:15,117 --> 00:57:16,849
Was this okay?

778
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,897
Do you feel anything?

779
00:57:24,415 --> 00:57:26,936
- It feels like...
- Fiona.

780
00:57:26,956 --> 00:57:29,502
- What do you feel?
- I do not know, I don't...

781
00:57:29,522 --> 00:57:31,788
have words to describe it.

782
00:57:31,808 --> 00:57:34,399
Warm...? Does it feel warm?

783
00:57:34,419 --> 00:57:37,616
- Warm...?
- Does it feel nice?

784
00:57:45,032 --> 00:57:48,896
No, I'm on the night shift, I need to...

785
00:57:48,947 --> 00:57:51,063
I don't feel right, Jonas.

786
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:54,066
I need to go and get my
injection, I need to go to work.

787
00:58:05,059 --> 00:58:08,637
- What was that?
- Fiona, there is more.

788
00:58:08,757 --> 00:58:10,828
So much more.

789
00:58:23,315 --> 00:58:27,115
I remember it now. I Dreamed it.

790
00:58:27,321 --> 00:58:29,150
When I was younger.

791
00:58:29,751 --> 00:58:31,875
I told my parents...

792
00:58:31,978 --> 00:58:36,263
"It was the sturning" they said.
"Everyone had them."

793
00:58:36,389 --> 00:58:40,741
"Medication would stop them.
Nothing be couldn't we fixed."

794
00:58:40,761 --> 00:58:43,667
"Precision of language"
and the teacher said:

795
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,479
- "That's right, Lily".
- Very Good!

796
00:58:46,843 --> 00:58:50,287
Jonas... Just in time for feelings.

797
00:58:50,707 --> 00:58:52,664
- Lily telling us how...
- Where's Gabe?

798
00:58:52,685 --> 00:58:54,980
Uncertain was returned
to the nurturing center.

799
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,375
- What happened?
- He failed his test of maturity.

800
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:01,105
Again. I couldn't ask
for another extension,

801
00:59:01,135 --> 00:59:03,343
so I have to release
into elsewhere.

802
00:59:03,931 --> 00:59:07,380
- Released him...? - I certainly
gave best choice, didn't we?

803
00:59:08,972 --> 00:59:13,101
- But he is family.
- Precision of language, please!

804
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:16,208
Sit down. Eat with us.

805
00:59:19,196 --> 00:59:21,464
I just need to rest for a while.

806
00:59:33,683 --> 00:59:36,697
I hadn't been wrong, this was wrong.

807
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:40,592
I hadn't eliminated murder,
they brought it home!

808
00:59:40,836 --> 00:59:43,313
They just called it by a different name.

809
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:53,791
Father, he didn't know any better.

810
00:59:55,423 --> 00:59:57,195
I did.

811
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:19,307
Jonas, what are you doing?

812
01:00:19,337 --> 01:00:21,963
It's against the rules to leave
your Community this late.

813
01:00:21,983 --> 01:00:23,628
Asher, there is something
I have to do,

814
01:00:23,658 --> 01:00:25,641
it's right, but it's
sort of against the rules.

815
01:00:25,661 --> 01:00:29,356
If it's right thing to do...
How can it be against the rules?

816
01:00:29,377 --> 01:00:32,040
There are things I've learned that
you don't know, that you can't know,

817
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:35,103
- not because it's your fault... - Jonas
you need to go back to your family unit!

818
01:00:35,123 --> 01:00:36,428
But that's the point!

819
01:00:36,485 --> 01:00:39,345
It isn't my family!
And neither is yours!

820
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:42,335
- Asher, I gotta go. - Jonas, listen!
- Get out of my way. - Jonas, listen!

821
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:43,550
What are you...?

822
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:09,277
Giver!

823
01:01:10,546 --> 01:01:12,415
Giver! Wake up.

824
01:01:12,885 --> 01:01:16,020
- I don't do sleeping to wake up.
- Something can be done.

825
01:01:16,108 --> 01:01:18,349
- Something can be done!
- What do you purpose?

826
01:01:18,369 --> 01:01:20,939
All the memories back and back and
back and back can be returned.

827
01:01:20,965 --> 01:01:23,824
I need to leave the Community, I need
to find the boundary of memories.

828
01:01:23,899 --> 01:01:26,018
- And then?
- And then cross it!

829
01:01:26,038 --> 01:01:27,732
- No more discussion.
- A slowly...

830
01:01:27,752 --> 01:01:29,493
- Gabe is in danger.
- Slowly.

831
01:01:29,513 --> 01:01:32,317
I can't wait anymore!
Something must be done!

832
01:01:34,781 --> 01:01:37,331
If you had that map, then why
you didn't try to leave?

833
01:01:37,351 --> 01:01:40,373
I was waiting, for someone like you.

834
01:01:40,843 --> 01:01:43,816
You're the reason we
have a chance, so...

835
01:01:44,292 --> 01:01:47,193
The plan will be for you
to go and for me to stay.

836
01:01:47,213 --> 01:01:49,628
If you did cross this boundary...

837
01:01:50,241 --> 01:01:53,717
And if the memories are set free, all
of the pain that you felt all the...

838
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:56,506
Confusion, chaos, it would all return!

839
01:01:56,526 --> 01:01:59,179
- So you have to stay to help them?
- Yes.

840
01:02:00,574 --> 01:02:02,446
And for my daughter.

841
01:02:02,778 --> 01:02:04,677
That's what you would have wanted.

842
01:02:04,697 --> 01:02:07,564
- Your daughter...?
- Rosemary.

843
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:11,740
Now: your friend if he truly
saw the Triangle of Rocks...

844
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,311
Bring up Jonas activity for
the past year as well.

845
01:02:15,818 --> 01:02:19,594
- So Asher came directly to you?
- Yes.

846
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:22,439
What was Jonas's disposition
at the evening meal?

847
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:26,208
Dissatisfied. Anxious. Indignant.

848
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:29,080
Setup a communication with
the receiver's memory.

849
01:02:29,118 --> 01:02:31,929
We're not permitted to see
into the receiver's residence.

850
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:36,430
- We can only transmit.
- Well then we shall only transmit.

851
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:41,593
If you go, head towards the triangle,
away from the other communities.

852
01:02:41,613 --> 01:02:43,555
That will lead to boundary of memories.

853
01:02:43,575 --> 01:02:45,824
Please, Standby for a transmission.

854
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:49,879
- I apologize for your intrusion.
- I accept your apology.

855
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:54,113
We have a problem: receiver
in training is missing,

856
01:02:54,195 --> 01:02:57,111
And he physically attacked
his friend, Asher.

857
01:02:57,186 --> 01:03:02,290
- He did? That's serious.
- Do you know where Jonas is?

858
01:03:04,134 --> 01:03:05,826
I do not.

859
01:03:09,574 --> 01:03:12,088
Well Thank you very much for...

860
01:03:12,145 --> 01:03:14,657
helping us to narrow
down the possibilities.

861
01:03:14,739 --> 01:03:19,173
- I'll contact you if he comes here.
- Only if it not in the imposition.

862
01:03:20,205 --> 01:03:21,540
Thank you.

863
01:03:24,177 --> 01:03:26,089
He is lying...

864
01:03:26,153 --> 01:03:28,614
- Talk!
- They are going to kill Gabe.

865
01:03:28,715 --> 01:03:31,668
I'm leaving, I'm leaving tonight
and I'm going to take him with me.

866
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:33,875
Jonas Not yet, you're not ready.

867
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:36,961
When they decided to kill Gabe,
they decided I was ready.

868
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:47,219
I like this map, don't mess it
up, I'll be wanting it back.

869
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:54,158
Do you mind if I accelerate
your training a bit?

870
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:00,601
You'd think that someone who
is the keeper of emotions,

871
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:02,201
then I would be better...

872
01:04:03,483 --> 01:04:05,230
Well...

873
01:04:05,737 --> 01:04:08,785
I love you, Jonas.

874
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,727
Look... Here it is.

875
01:04:14,827 --> 01:04:18,329
You have the courage...
Let me give you the strength.

876
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:19,573
Can I just...

877
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,221
Attention all community residents.

878
01:04:48,241 --> 01:04:52,188
Receiver in training has been
reported missing from his dwelling.

879
01:04:52,234 --> 01:04:55,671
Please be alert,
you may be in danger.

880
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:06,323
Group 1, from the inside edge.
Then Group 2, from the center.

881
01:05:06,393 --> 01:05:07,965
No I think like this.

882
01:05:11,434 --> 01:05:14,426
Welcome to the Nurturing Center.

883
01:05:19,058 --> 01:05:21,212
- Shall I convey the others?
- Yes.

884
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:27,184
Jonas! I heard an alert.
What's going on?

885
01:05:27,204 --> 01:05:29,601
Hey, where's Gabe? Is he here?

886
01:05:29,645 --> 01:05:33,416
- Is any of this? - If he is back then,
he be with youngsters in

887
01:05:33,436 --> 01:05:36,641
- Restricted floor.
- Show me where.

888
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:38,605
Fiona! Please.

889
01:05:40,756 --> 01:05:42,657
They are down stairs, come on.

890
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:47,807
Jonas was chosen for the most
important position in our community.

891
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:51,373
He was asked if he was strong enough.

892
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,179
It turned out he was not.

893
01:05:53,385 --> 01:05:56,095
Instead, he's a rebel.

894
01:05:56,215 --> 01:05:57,899
Will must be stopped.

895
01:05:57,968 --> 01:05:59,522
By you.

896
01:05:59,585 --> 01:06:01,585
When you find him...

897
01:06:02,448 --> 01:06:03,876
Take him.

898
01:06:04,133 --> 01:06:06,489
- Gabe is in danger.
- Jonas, he is fine, I'll show you.

899
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,146
No, he is not fine.

900
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:09,641
He should be here.

901
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:13,034
- Fiona: I'm leaving, tonight.
- "Leaving"?

902
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:15,018
- What do you mean?
- I'm taking Gabe.

903
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:18,234
We are Leaving the Community.
I want you to come with us.

904
01:06:29,543 --> 01:06:32,830
I don't have the words to describe it.

905
01:06:37,322 --> 01:06:41,261
Fiona there is more. So much more.

906
01:06:44,874 --> 01:06:46,497
What are they doing?

907
01:06:46,529 --> 01:06:50,886
- Fiona: what do you feel?
- I don't have the words to describe it.

908
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:53,307
Attention Nurturers.

909
01:06:53,441 --> 01:06:55,446
Please secure your work area

910
01:06:55,476 --> 01:06:57,827
and immediately report to
the newborn's nursery,

911
01:06:57,903 --> 01:07:00,719
to allow for security
search procedures.

912
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:05,149
Promptly report all sightings
at the nearest security kiosk.

913
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,297
Thank you.

914
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:21,375
Fiona, we gotta go now!
You, me and Gabe!

915
01:07:21,395 --> 01:07:25,708
Jonas, I can't what about my family
unit the other new Children?

916
01:07:25,803 --> 01:07:27,462
I can't leave them.

917
01:07:27,531 --> 01:07:30,638
This the only way, This is the
only way to make everything okay.

918
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,186
I can't go.

919
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:40,584
When I get there, you'll understand.

920
01:07:41,053 --> 01:07:43,434
- I'll Come back for you.
- Jonas!

921
01:07:51,052 --> 01:07:52,385
Come back!

922
01:07:54,095 --> 01:07:55,612
Now go, Jonas!

923
01:07:56,414 --> 01:07:58,801
Hey freeze, freeze!

924
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:56,428
Subject lost to the edge.
Search terminated.

925
01:09:56,448 --> 01:10:00,527
And I asked him why he was out so late.
He seemed angry.

926
01:10:00,628 --> 01:10:04,097
I didn't understand why,
but I wanted to help him.

927
01:10:04,118 --> 01:10:07,021
Then it hit me,
and at first time...

928
01:10:07,097 --> 01:10:08,950
I can tell why you've
been acting this way,

929
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:11,625
your injections levels
are extremely low.

930
01:10:14,144 --> 01:10:15,932
I can correct that.

931
01:10:16,107 --> 01:10:18,361
"Friends forever" right...?

932
01:10:20,637 --> 01:10:23,444
Then we will addressed what's happened.

933
01:10:36,226 --> 01:10:39,797
When I went over the edge,
we shouldn't have made it.

934
01:10:39,872 --> 01:10:42,099
This was a miracle.

935
01:10:42,294 --> 01:10:44,623
The Giver had talked about them.

936
01:10:45,024 --> 01:10:48,278
He told me that I could draw
strength from the memories.

937
01:10:49,329 --> 01:10:51,523
I knew, by giving them to Gabe,

938
01:10:52,049 --> 01:10:54,375
I could protect them.

939
01:10:58,793 --> 01:11:01,223
Cut your finger and put a
little blood on this apple.

940
01:11:01,243 --> 01:11:03,876
When you leave in the morning,
put the apple over on the sensor.

941
01:11:03,906 --> 01:11:06,540
I've been doing it for months,
since worked every single time.

942
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,465
What has he taught...?

943
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:10,232
A dwelling is not a "home".

944
01:11:10,252 --> 01:11:13,233
This the only way to
make everything okay.

945
01:11:13,274 --> 01:11:16,634
Gabe is in danger. What they are
gonna do him is really bad.

946
01:11:16,655 --> 01:11:18,589
I want you to come with us.

947
01:11:18,803 --> 01:11:21,964
When I get there, you'll understand.
I'll Come back for you.

948
01:11:22,676 --> 01:11:24,136
Yes...

949
01:11:28,969 --> 01:11:30,430
Careful...

950
01:11:30,818 --> 01:11:32,248
Careful.

951
01:11:34,885 --> 01:11:36,722
I apologize...

952
01:11:36,948 --> 01:11:38,697
For failing again.

953
01:11:38,717 --> 01:11:40,376
I don't think you failed.

954
01:11:40,445 --> 01:11:42,331
I think you succeeded.

955
01:11:42,444 --> 01:11:44,053
With your plan...

956
01:11:44,179 --> 01:11:47,157
Ever since the girl was released
you haven't been the same.

957
01:11:47,214 --> 01:11:50,308
I genuinely hoped Jonas would help you.

958
01:11:50,453 --> 01:11:53,765
It would have fresh start, if
you two have work together...

959
01:11:55,605 --> 01:11:57,455
Which is seems you have.

960
01:11:58,437 --> 01:12:00,579
We will find Jonas.

961
01:12:27,896 --> 01:12:32,728
Jonas, our Receiver of
Memories, lost to the Edge.

962
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:35,206
Jonas...! Jonas...!

963
01:12:42,422 --> 01:12:46,561
- How did they know Jonas is gone?
- We must not says his names anymore.

964
01:12:46,905 --> 01:12:50,340
- I will.
- You must keep quiet now, Lily.

965
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,680
And hippo is really "an elephant".

966
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,065
What I'm about to tell you, you
must never repeat to anyone.

967
01:13:08,546 --> 01:13:12,580
- I don't believe Jonas is lost.
- But the ceremony of Loss...

968
01:13:12,737 --> 01:13:14,529
I'm not sure of it.

969
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:16,820
I don't expect you
to understand,

970
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:19,838
but you must know that
Jonas has become dangerous.

971
01:13:20,533 --> 01:13:24,958
He must be stopped.He must not get
beyond the Triangle of Rocks.

972
01:13:25,522 --> 01:13:27,500
What you want me to do?

973
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,698
You know, Jonas,
I want you to find him.

974
01:13:33,678 --> 01:13:35,337
And then...

975
01:13:35,858 --> 01:13:38,172
I want you to lose him.

976
01:13:44,609 --> 01:13:47,341
Power Depleted.

977
01:14:56,714 --> 01:14:58,239
Jonas...

978
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:02,056
- What are you doing...?
- Asher please, let us go.

979
01:15:03,218 --> 01:15:05,543
I can't. I supposed to...

980
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:06,994
To what?

981
01:15:09,231 --> 01:15:10,750
To loose you.

982
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:15,588
Asher... if you're my friend...

983
01:15:15,707 --> 01:15:19,666
If you were ever my friend... can
you please somehow trust me?

984
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:21,456
Trust me now.

985
01:16:04,963 --> 01:16:07,128
I do trust you, Jonas.

986
01:16:18,471 --> 01:16:20,519
Come on, please...

987
01:16:22,832 --> 01:16:24,162
Jonas...!

988
01:16:42,235 --> 01:16:43,868
You found him!

989
01:16:45,491 --> 01:16:46,950
I did.

990
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,562
For the good of all of us...

991
01:16:49,806 --> 01:16:53,192
I beg you, to finish this.

992
01:16:54,105 --> 01:16:55,958
Its finished.

993
01:17:13,491 --> 01:17:15,221
Hey. It's okay...

994
01:17:23,752 --> 01:17:28,331
Nothing the Giver had shown me, had
prepared me for the voices in my head.

995
01:17:28,351 --> 01:17:30,435
Screaming me to stop.

996
01:17:31,073 --> 01:17:34,034
But I knew that Fiona will
be punished for helping me.

997
01:17:34,111 --> 01:17:36,410
Asher, for let me go.

998
01:17:36,698 --> 01:17:40,222
The only way to help them,
to keep them alive...

999
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:42,741
Was to get to the boundary.

1000
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:45,334
If it even existed.

1001
01:17:47,809 --> 01:17:52,648
I strengthened Gabe with memories
of having enough and knowing joy.

1002
01:17:56,124 --> 01:17:59,496
It was in memory of Fiona
for kept me going.

1003
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:10,496
Fiona?

1004
01:18:13,528 --> 01:18:17,419
I have taken care of everything.
We've arranged for your release.

1005
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:19,210
It will be a nice ceremony.

1006
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:21,616
Now you get some rest.

1007
01:18:21,904 --> 01:18:24,004
- I felt things.
- What?

1008
01:18:24,024 --> 01:18:26,209
- I know that there is something more.
- Fiona...

1009
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:28,495
Something missing from our lives.

1010
01:18:28,683 --> 01:18:32,393
No, not "missing", something
that has been stolen

1011
01:18:32,413 --> 01:18:34,028
from me and from you.

1012
01:18:34,697 --> 01:18:37,260
I do not know what it is exactly.

1013
01:18:38,299 --> 01:18:39,925
But Jonas does.

1014
01:18:41,282 --> 01:18:44,996
I had felt things. And they were warm...

1015
01:18:45,634 --> 01:18:47,541
And they were nice.

1016
01:18:49,556 --> 01:18:51,623
And they were beautiful.

1017
01:18:52,005 --> 01:18:55,961
I have felt things. I have felt things!

1018
01:18:56,805 --> 01:18:58,921
I have felt things...!

1019
01:19:46,395 --> 01:19:48,582
Where is the Tower, Gabe?

1020
01:19:50,402 --> 01:19:52,496
Tower should be here...

1021
01:20:50,987 --> 01:20:52,880
You can stop this...

1022
01:20:52,956 --> 01:20:54,572
Stop what?

1023
01:20:55,179 --> 01:20:58,576
If you don't wanna see it, sit
down with the other elders.

1024
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,832
Or close your eyes!

1025
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,619
Ceremony of release to elsewhere.

1026
01:21:10,076 --> 01:21:11,715
Come on, Fiona.

1027
01:21:13,633 --> 01:21:15,313
You're comfortable?

1028
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:25,235
I'm not uncomfortable, I'm afraid.

1029
01:21:26,036 --> 01:21:27,903
You don't have to be afraid.

1030
01:21:28,366 --> 01:21:30,086
You know me.

1031
01:21:30,387 --> 01:21:33,743
I will be very gentle, I promise.

1032
01:21:34,218 --> 01:21:35,655
Okay...?

1033
01:21:38,076 --> 01:21:40,710
Her name was Rosemary.

1034
01:21:40,835 --> 01:21:42,678
She was my daughter.

1035
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,728
- I loved her...
- Precision of language.

1036
01:21:45,748 --> 01:21:47,923
I could not be more precise.

1037
01:21:47,943 --> 01:21:50,369
Do you know what that's like?

1038
01:21:51,395 --> 01:21:53,587
To love someone?

1039
01:21:54,101 --> 01:21:55,889
I do.

1040
01:21:59,277 --> 01:22:01,574
I cried.

1041
01:22:01,699 --> 01:22:03,615
I felt sorrow...

1042
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:06,487
I've sang, danced...

1043
01:22:07,294 --> 01:22:09,696
I felt real joy...

1044
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:14,515
Then you should know better then anyone.

1045
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:18,708
You have seen children starv...

1046
01:22:18,729 --> 01:22:19,946
Da.

1047
01:22:19,966 --> 01:22:23,381
You have seen people stabbing
on each other's neck...

1048
01:22:23,426 --> 01:22:25,217
Just for the view.

1049
01:22:25,937 --> 01:22:29,228
You know what it is peoples like
when men blow each others up.

1050
01:22:29,249 --> 01:22:30,455
Yes.

1051
01:22:30,475 --> 01:22:33,388
- Over a simple land, sand...
- I do, I do.

1052
01:22:33,408 --> 01:22:35,310
- But...
- And yet...

1053
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:40,421
And yet! You and Jonas want
to open that door again.

1054
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:44,623
- Bring all that back.
- If you only could see possibilities...

1055
01:22:44,643 --> 01:22:46,715
- But why?
- Of Love!

1056
01:22:46,735 --> 01:22:49,571
With love comes faith,
with comes hope...

1057
01:22:49,591 --> 01:22:52,426
Love is just passion that can turn.

1058
01:22:52,446 --> 01:22:56,009
It turns into contempt! And murder!

1059
01:22:56,029 --> 01:22:57,764
We could choose better!

1060
01:22:59,927 --> 01:23:03,355
People are weak. People are selfish.

1061
01:23:04,693 --> 01:23:07,168
When people have freedom to choose...

1062
01:23:07,393 --> 01:23:09,303
They choose wrong.

1063
01:23:09,441 --> 01:23:11,548
Every single time.

1064
01:24:31,401 --> 01:24:33,156
That's a sledge...

1065
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:38,484
Loss... and the pain...

1066
01:24:38,829 --> 01:24:41,705
Music, joy...

1067
01:24:41,987 --> 01:24:45,201
These all are impossible,

1068
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:47,352
beautiful feeling of love.

1069
01:24:47,372 --> 01:24:49,669
Your son, he felt it.

1070
01:25:05,390 --> 01:25:07,271
The girl...

1071
01:25:07,584 --> 01:25:09,746
- She is felted.
- That's enough.

1072
01:25:09,766 --> 01:25:12,222
We are living a life of shadows.

1073
01:25:12,398 --> 01:25:17,728
Of echoes, of fake distant
whispers of once made is real.

1074
01:25:17,796 --> 01:25:19,555
Excuse me for one second, Fiona.

1075
01:25:19,575 --> 01:25:21,643
We must continue.

1076
01:27:03,367 --> 01:27:06,521
I wish I would have been there
when the memories returned.

1077
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:09,108
They were the truth.

1078
01:27:09,352 --> 01:27:12,527
The elders and their rules were lie.

1079
01:27:13,633 --> 01:27:16,378
So I do not apologize.

1080
01:27:20,253 --> 01:27:22,671
I knew Fiona was safe.

1081
01:27:22,796 --> 01:27:24,909
That I'd see her again.

1082
01:27:25,329 --> 01:27:28,550
And that I held the
future there in my arms.

1083
01:27:32,207 --> 01:27:34,905
The Giver had led us here.

1084
01:27:35,331 --> 01:27:37,161
To this house...

1085
01:27:37,612 --> 01:27:39,460
It was real.

1086
01:27:41,617 --> 01:27:45,479
From far behind me, from
the place I had left...

1087
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:48,494
I thought I heard music too.

1088
01:27:49,582 --> 01:27:52,187
Perhaps it was only an echo.

1089
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:54,906
But it was enough.

1090
01:27:55,644 --> 01:27:58,671
It will lead us all home.
