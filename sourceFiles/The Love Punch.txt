Hello.

00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,993
Hello.

4
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,192
I'll have the same.

5
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,660
Ah, weddings!

11
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,145
But well done for trying.

12
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,765
I heard the new one legged it.

13
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:12,113
Michaela and I have
parted company, yes.

14
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,575
These young women, they just can't
make up their minds, can they?

15
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,024
No.

16
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,539
You get me, Kate, though.
Or you used to.

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,418
That's because I'm a trained

retired corporate sellout?

19
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,840
Marvellous. I'm playing some

What?

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,427
- You're going to be so bored.
- I will not be bored.

22
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,053
- Totally and utterly bored.
- Rubbish!

23
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,422
- Bored.
- Rubbish.

24
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,851
- You look great, by the way.
- Oh, shut up.

25
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,380
Damn it! Still handsome.

26
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,981
- OK, so he's here.
- Who?

27
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,349
- Ken.
- Oh!

00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,443

29
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,737

- Ken?

31
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,574

more aggressively.

32
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,825
Get out there.

33
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,951
I do get out there!

34
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:03,357
Taking your laptop out into the
garden is not getting out there.

35
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,378
Come on, you two!
Get back together.

36
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,922
- Come on, get back together.
- Not now, Jerry.

37
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,717
- Well, we live in hope. Just imagine.

00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,510

00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,015
Oh! Wh... whoosh!

41
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,059
- Ah... flowers!
- Yeah, they're for you.

42
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,770
Oh, thank you.
They're... they're lovely.

43
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,596
- You're allergic.
- Only mildly.

44
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,318
Why is Kate holding flowers
when she's allergic?

45
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,402
Only mildly.

46
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,279
- I'm so sorry. I didn't know...
- No, no, no, it's fine.

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,908
It's not all flowers. Really, I like them.
I want them. I actually want them.

48
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,118

She's allergic.

105
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,408

106

- Ah, that's not bad.
- Nice one.

113
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,305
- Whoo-hoo!
- Sure we won't be bored now?

114
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:34,518
Bored? Bored?
What, with all this? Bored!

115
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,136
As if.

116
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,231

- Oh, no. It's not gone again, has it?

- Oh, yeah. Shit!
- Anything I can do?

118
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,946
Yeah, just... just put your...
put your thumb right there, mate.

119
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,450
Oh, I'd better not stand
there. People will talk.

00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,578

wash your jeans inside out,

121
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,705

122
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,499
and never put anything into your
mouth that hasn't been boiled first.

123
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,502
- Oh, it's Dad.
- Oh.

124
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,462
Hi, Dad.

125
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,213
Hello, my darling.
Have you left yet?

126
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,632
I'm just setting off. I'm with Mum.

127
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,050
'Lucky girl, going to Edinburgh.'

128
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,678
Your Mum and I were quite the
dynamic pair on campus in our day.

129
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,514
Maybe I'll buy a flat near you
and relive my student days.

130
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,726
- Er... no, thanks, Dad. It's my turn.
- 'Yes, it is indeed.'

131
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,853
Don't know where Jerry's going.
No, Jerry's getting lost.

132
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,563
'So what are you gonna
do now you're retired?'

133
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,273
'Oh, I don't know.'

134
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,401
Maybe I'll finally buy that boat and
sail around the world, you know.

135
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,683
- You were gonna do that with Mum.
- 'That's true, I was.'

136
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,531
Dad, I have to go. I've got
a big drive ahead of me.

137
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,160
OK. Call me when you get in, now.
I love you, Sophie.

138
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,528
'Love you too, Dad.'

139
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,998
- He's threatening to relive his student days.
- Mmm.

140
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,043
- What were you two like at college?
- Naive, unrealistic, ill-prepared.

141
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,295
So, everything that I am right now.

142
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,755
Not you, not you, never you.

143
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,883
Not at all. Come on, off you go.

144
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,804
Don't forget to call me when you
get there. Always go out in groups.

145
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,516
If you get homesick, come home.
And try and find a good taxi service.

146
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,309
Because some of them
have women-only drivers.

147
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,805
Women-only drivers, got it.
Anything else?

148
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,431
Be yourself, you're lovely.

149
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,619
Oh!

150
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,766
Hi, honey, I'm home.

151
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,896
Hello, Rumps. Come here.

152
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,775
Hello, darling.

153
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,153
What shall we do
this afternoon, eh?

154
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,307
Let's get drunk.

155
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,279
Hi, honey, I'm home.

156
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,350
You can hide all you like.

157
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:24,480
I've spotted you and we should
get a start on your last week.

158
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,398
Yes, of course.
Good morning, Doreen.

159
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,027
It has always been our good
fortune to share the same train.

160
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,738
No rest for the wicked, Mr Jones.

161
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,282
Doreen, after all these years, after
everything we've been through,

162
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,992
are you still refusing
to call me Richard?

163
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:41,288
Yes! Now, you have a ten o'clock
meeting with the new owners.

164
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,415
- Yeah.
- Any idea who they are?

165
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,692
Hmm...

166
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,128
Young is all I know, Doreen.

167
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,464
I took your advice on their
pension share offer.

168
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,591
- I took them up on it.
- What? The whole lot?

169
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,929
Yes, lots of us did. Janice in
Accounts, Marcus in Payroll.

170
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,181
Well, it's a solid offer.

171
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:03,132
Now, you have a prostate
check at 2:15 today.

172
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,346
I'm gonna miss these
little chats, Doreen.

173
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,614
I thought my leaving
party was on Friday.

174
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,242
I don't think this is
a party, Mr Jones.

175
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,442
- It's all gone, Richard. The lot!
- What?

176
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,116
Morning, everyone.

177
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,591
Richard, what's going on?

178
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,426
I don't know, Janice.
I have no idea.

179
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,428
- Did you know about this?
- No, of course not, Marcus.

180
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,056
- Is this legal? Can they just do this?
- Yes, of course they can.

181
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,058
Now, wait a minute.
We don't know that.

182
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,227
Just... just give me
some time here, please.

183
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,020
- Will we get paid this month?
- Yes, of course you will.

184
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,523
- Did you know this was coming?
- Of course he didn't!

185
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,942
Someone said the shares are
worthless. Is that true?

186
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,720
- No.
- Yes.

187
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,284
Jesus!

188
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:05,581
I suppose they'll let us in at some point.
To collect our things, I mean.

189
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:09,282
Doreen, I promise you,
I will sort this out.

190
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,509
Everyone, listen up! I promise you
I'll get to the bottom of this.

191
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,429
I will find out what's going on
but I just need some time, OK?

192
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,972
What are we supposed to do now?

193
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,933
- How?
- But, Richard, what can you do?

194
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,811
I... I don't know,
but I promise you,

195
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:31,648
I will make sure that every one
of you gets what they're due.

196
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:36,270
I will not, will not, let you down.

197
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,366
OK, Jean-Baptiste, here I come.

198
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,754
I am interested in the, er...

199
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:58,160
the arts and culture.

200
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:03,430
I love travel and adventure

201
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:07,142
and generally being...

202
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:12,564
spon-tan-eous.

203
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,182
Whoosh!

204
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,353
Oh, God!

205
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,993
'Finally, after heavy bidding, a diamond
has been sold today at Sotheby's

206
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,913
'for a record 10.8 million.'

207
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:28,872
Blimey!

208
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,011
'Known in the trade as
the Eye of the Rainbow

00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:33,335

OK.

219
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,306
Ken, I'm coming for you.

220
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,490
Oh, twice in one week. What
have I done to deserve this?

221
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,659
- Kate, we need to talk.
- Not now, Richard. I'm busy.

222
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,743
- Please, I just need to...
- Hello!

223
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,037
- Hello, Ken.
- Look, no flowers!

224
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,735
Well done!

225
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,835
- Oh, it's you again.
- Ken. Again, hi.

226
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,462
Kate, I need to speak to you.

227
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,922
- I'll see you...
- Yes...

228
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,248
OK, great. Looking forward.

229
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,431
- Have you been drinking?
- No... Yes.

230
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,808
- Look, what difference does it make?
- A lot of difference.

231
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,853
You're prone to exaggeration
and wild statements of intent.

232
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,855
Look, there are big
problems at the office.

233
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,358
Please, tell it to Anastasia or
Michaela or whoever the latest is...

234
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,652
Culco has gone into receivership.

235
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,780
The new owners have stripped us of any
value and run us into the ground.

236
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,906
The shares are worthless.

237
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,576
My pension, your pension,
was all tied up in those shares.

238
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,662
The mortgage payments on my place,
this place, the kids' university fees,

239
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,987
everything we'd saved up for
them afterwards, it's all gone.

240
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,669
Kate, I virtually had the
whole company on board.

241
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,199
Marcus, Janice, I even
got Doreen involved.

242
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,053
Come on.

243
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,387
What do we know about these guys?

244
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,640
Lavco. They came in hard
and fast out of nowhere.

245
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,018
The holding company traded
by the name of Lexon.

246
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,772
We were persuaded to integrate
our pension fund into theirs.

247
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,316
Turns out Lexon was hollow, toxic.

248
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:23,236
So when they turned to
dust, so did our pension.

249
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,073
There's always someone
bigger behind these things,

250
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:29,284
someone who manages to wipe
their hands clean and move on.

251
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,582
- Still allergic to cat hair?
- Worse than ever.

252
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,156
Go on, Rumpy, sit on him.

253
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,295
- I see you got your PhD.
- Yeah.

254
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:44,716
- So, how's life as a lecturer?
- Under-paid.

255
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,636
- What are the students like?
- Under-motivated.

256
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,764
Could you just stop
fidgeting and sit down?

257
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:54,893
I'm on the site but I can't get any
real info. I'm being blocked.

258
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,229
We need a password.

259
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,606
- We need...
- Matt.

260
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,816
We need Matt.

261
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,776
'Mum, you do know
hacking is illegal.'

262
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,320
'I know, Matt and I would never
want you to do anything illegal.

263
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:10,033
'But I wondered if you could just...
accidentally stumble into it.'

264
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,936
Accidentally stumble into it?

265
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,288
- 'Son, do as your mother asks.'
- Dad?

266
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,083
- What are you doing there?
- 'It's a long story, Matty boy.

267
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,128
'But right now it's payback time
on that misspent youth I funded.'

268
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,504
- 'We funded.'
- OK, hold on.

269
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,284
I'll have to use my other
computer. Wait here.

270
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,723
- Is that his roommate, Tyler?
- I think it is.

271
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,975
Oh, Tyler!

272
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:39,271
- 'Close the door.'
- 'Come on, son. Close it now.'

273
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,897
Mr and Mrs J?

274
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,567
'Yes, we're here on Skype.'

275
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,561
'Sorry.'

276
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:50,065
'OK, I've emailed you the password.
That will get you in.'

277
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,576
- 'Good man!'
- 'Well done, Matt.'

278
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,446
Oh, and guys... it's really
good to see you together again.

279
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,751
- Oh!
- Hey!

280
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,128
- We're in.
- Good.

281
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,657
I've always wanted to say that.

282
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,467
There we go. Lexon.

283
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,886
Owned by one Vincent
Mathias Kruger,

284
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,264
international hedge fund
manager, born in Budapest,

285
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:19,060
currently resides in Paris, horribly young,
keen sportsman, patron of the arts.

286
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,854
Oh! Mentor to the young.

287
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,816
Could he look any more like a money
grabbing, cheating, immoral little shit?

288
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,402
But you're not gonna get away with
it, my friend, not on my watch.

289
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,279
- He can't hear you.
- I know he can't hear me.

290
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,573
But he's certainly
gonna feel my wrath.

291
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:35,243
- OK, Guevara, what's your plan?
- I'm gonna go to Paris.

292
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,496
I'm gonna go to Paris with
what little money I have left

293
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,457
and bang on that man's door so loudly
he's gonna pay for me to go away.

294
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,125
I'm gonna get back
what's rightfully mine.

295
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,251
- Ours.
- Ours.

296
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,880
I didn't work for 25 years in that
God-forsaken job to have some little...

297
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,006
Prick?

298
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:52,802
Prick like him stroll in and
spirit away my, our, retirement.

299
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,640
I'm gonna do it for all the little people
who've done nothing but play by the rules.

300
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,726
For Marcus and Janice,
for Doreen, for you.

301
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,770
No, do not do it for me.

302
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,969
For the kids.

303
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,102
- How's your French?
- Rusty. Why?

304
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,604
<i>Non.</i>

305
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:15,352
<i>Non, non, non, non, non, non.</i>
Absolutely not. No way!

306
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,136
You missed it again!
I said the second exit.

307
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,346
I couldn't get across.

308
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,473
What do you mean, you
couldn't get across? Just indicate!

309
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,434
I am indicating, darling, but
they're not paying any bloody attention.

310
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,061
How can your driving
not have improved?

311
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,940
You've had years to practise.
Be assertive, man!

312
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,650
Be assertive? Right.

313
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,830
- This is very unlike her.
- She might have got a better offer.

314
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:06,167
- A better offer than Ken?
- Our dog's a better offer than Ken.

315
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,345
- Let's just get something straight, shall we?
- Yes, let's.

316
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,848
- We go, we sort this mess out.
- Uh-huh.

317
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,392
And then we go on with the
rest of our lives, separately.

318
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,591
Sounds good to me.

319
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,149
Come on then, Trotsky.
Let's get this over with.

320
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,450
<i>Merci.</i>

321
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,416
- Hmm... no dice.
- No.

322
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,261
Do you remember that time
at Soph's PTA meeting

323
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,664
when we couldn't get in
to see the headmaster?

324
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,421
- And you...?
- Yeah.

325
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,837
- Worth a try.
- Yeah.

326
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,401
Oh, sweetheart... Oh, damn!
Oh, dear, dear.

327
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,021
A glass of water, please.

328
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,150
- Which floor?
- Top floor.

329
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,708
- Not bad, Miss Jones. Not bad.
- You never lose skills like that.

330
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,950
- Can you still do that thing with your...
- No, Richard.

331
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,510
- Mr Kruger's office?
- <i>Oui.</i>

332
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,834
<i>- Très bon.
- Quoi?</i>

333
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,309
Mr Kruger, I'm sorry...

334
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,728
It's OK. Can I help you?

335
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,730
You bought the company
I work for last week.

336
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,900
- Pardon?
- And ran it into the ground.

337
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,527
I don't understand, sir.

338
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,680
Vous <i>êtes un</i> money grabbing pig!

339
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,616
- Your company...
<i>- Votre... votre</i> company.

340
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:06,162
- ...bought my company...
- Hang on... <i>acheté ma</i>... company.

341
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,540
And ran it into the ground.

342
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,409
<i>Et le...</i>

343
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,239
Steady, Kate.

344
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,131
- Steady, Kate. Steady.
- Sorry.

345
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,509
I run a lot of companies into
the ground. Which one?

346
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,304
- Culco.
- Culco, er...

347
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:27,517
See, that was last week. I very much
live in the now, the <i>maintenant.</i>

348
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,478
Well, maybe this is
<i>maintenant</i> enough for you.

349
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,354
You stole all our money
and we want it back.

350
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,106
- And you are?
- This is my wife.

351
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,232
- Ex-wife.
- Ex-wife.

352
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,192
- Ex-wife?
- Yeah, we've established that now.

353
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,236
- So you're not denying it.
- No, I don't think so.

354
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,155
Listen, you, there are
people whose lives

355
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,031
depend on the pension
they were gonna receive.

356
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,026
You can't just throw them away
like that. It's just not fair.

357
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,862
OK, OK, you got me.

358
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,916
What I did was wrong,
reprehensible, evil even.

359
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:56,671
In a normal world, illegal. But that's
the beauty of it: it's completely legal.

360
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,715
Now, listen to me, you
little sack of shit.

361
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:02,093
You are messing with people's lives.
Proper, good, hardworking people

362
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,511
who have done absolutely nothing

363
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,555
but play by the bloody rules
laid out in front of them.

364
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,390
Oh, she definitely wears
the trousers, no?

365
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,642
I'm not even gonna rise to that.
Of course she does.

366
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,187
- We're the older generation. We're enlightened.
- We're divorced.

367
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,730
And we're done.

368
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:17,484
Put me down. Put me down!
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

369
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:21,488
Put me down. Put my wife down!
Put my wife down!

370
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,947
- There you go.
- Ex-wife.

371
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,324
Ex-wife.

372
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,700
- Could have had 'em.
- Shit!

373
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,911
We are totally taking
him down. Totally!

374
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,985
Now what, huh?

375
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,343
Whoo!

376
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:46,095
Close your mouth. Who do
you think she belongs to?

377
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:50,546
If I were a betting man,
I'd say... Here you go.

378
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,338
Bingo!

379
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,733
- Quick, let's follow.
- Good idea.

380
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,736
- Let me drive. I'm the better driver.
- No way, José. You forgot your license.

381
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,988
- Come on, Richard. I'm a much better driver.
- You forgot your license.

382
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,365
You're not a better driver.
You just think you are.

383
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,407
You'll regret it.

384
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,202
- Remember Hammersmith bridge?
- That's unfair.

385
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:13,081
You forgot to put oil in the tank.
You forgot to put oil in it.

386
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,792
- Go fast. Go fast.
- I'm not gonna go fast.

387
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,116
Quickly, they're getting away.

388
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,049
- You've gotta keep up, Richard.
- It's called tailing, Kate.

389
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,623
If we get too close, they'll
know they're being followed.

390
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,972
Well, that was the
world's shortest car chase.

391
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,516
What? It's a red light! You want
me to start running reds now?

392
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,669
No, God forbid, Richard.

393
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,300
Well, that was intense.

394
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,190
Thank you. Could have killed a nun.

395
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,140
Many nuns, possibly.
A whole load of dead nuns.

396
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,697
- Oh, that's them, Richard!
- What?

397
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,657
I've just seen them, Richard!
Please, let me drive.

398
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,701
- Please! Please, let me drive.
- Fine.

399
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,830
OK, OK. It's been a while.

400
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,832
What did you have for lunch?

401
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,359
What?

402
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,962
Buckle up.

403
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,131
Which way are we going?
Kate, we're going backwards.

404
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,883
- Yep.
- Backwards, Kate!

405
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,926
Putting my seat belt on.
Putting my seat belt on right now.

406
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:11,173
Kate, no, no, no, no!
Kate! Kate! Kate! Kate!

407
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,183
- Argh!
- Hold tight.

408
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:18,646
I'm holding tight! We can't even
afford the basic insurance.

409
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,024
Oh, fuck the insurance.

410
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,528
Whoo-hoo!

411
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,489
Ha! We did it! There they are.

412

00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,043

We're divorced. I kept his name.

- Yes.

00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,567
Yeah, you did, didn't you?

465
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,278
Yes, because it's been mine for some
time. And my kids have it. It's no biggy.

466
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:18,534
And you are holidaying together to
see if perhaps the flame still burns?

- No, so not. The flame is out.

00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,454
We do know.

471
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:35,218
Ah, I'm afraid the only two rooms
I have left are adjoining.

472

- What about those?
- Oh, no, they are all taken.

473

- Really?
- We'll take them. Thank you. Bonsoir.

Bonsoir.

476
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,983
Bloody hell. What floor?

477
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,728
- Haven't a clue.
- Christ!

478
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,699
You don't fancy rubbing some Deep
Heat into my coccyx, do you?

479
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,354
- No.
- Just a thought.

480
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,790
Ooh!

481
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:22,838

where I find myself.

482
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,769
<i>Pourquoi pas?</i>

483
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,786
There's two bowls down for Rumpus
and the kitchen light is on.

484
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:47,165
Sophie, darling! Hey,
got your leg over yet?

485
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,958
Hello. Sophie, darling?

486
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,419
You haven't heard from
you mother, have you?

487
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,870
No, it's nothing to worry about. It's just
we were supposed to see her yesterday.

488
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:18,681
"Of all the gin joints, in all the towns,
in all the world, she walks into mine."

489
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,189
What are the chances, eh?

490
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,000
Steak-frites.
That's what you'll have.

491
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,044
Nope. Turned veggie two years ago.

492
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,921
But you love meat.

493
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:38,049
People change, Richard. But you're
gonna have the cheese soufflé.

494
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,676
- Nope.
- But you love cheese.

495
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,888
- Cholesterol levels change, Kate.
- How's your prostate?

496
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,015
Fully functioning, thank you.
How are your bunions?

497
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,809
Oh, how sweet of you to remember.
Actually, they're awful.

498
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,896
High heels are no longer
an option. See?

499
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,800
Here's to our aging, ailing bodies.

500
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,972
- May I?
- Yes, go on.

501
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,537
Ooh, ooh!

502
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,690
Hey! Hey, sweetie!

503
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,668
How's it going?

504
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,628
Oh, I'm so glad.

505
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,463
And you like the people in your halls?

506
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,424
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

507
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,180
All right, yes, you've got to go.
Of course you've got to go.

508
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:31,560
Call me... call me later.
Yes, I love you... Bye... bye.

509
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:37,024
- Rich, what could I say to her?
- It's all right. It's fine.

510
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,804
Oh!

511
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,190
Hey, honey, how's it going?

512
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:47,561
Yeah? For every party
write an essay.

513
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,401
All right, for every three
parties write an essay.

514
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:56,460
No. No, no, no. I'm so
proud of you, sweetheart.

515
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,462
Is that what Mum said?

516
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,424
Ah, well, great minds and all that.

517
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,999
Listen, do me a favour, next time
you speak to your Mum, tell her...

518
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,431
Tell her I miss her.

519
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,724
OK.

520
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,377
I love you.

521
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,186
Bye, darling.

522
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,772
- What's got into you?
- I don't know.

523
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:20,985
Paris, retirement,
spending time with you,

524
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,029
having our money stolen.

525
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,353
That'll do it.

526
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,495
This is nice, right?

527
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,193
Yeah.

528
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,919
Michaela, er...

529
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,173
Just a sec... just one second.

530
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,828
Listen, Michaela, I can't talk
right now. Please understand.

531
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,309
It's OK, I'm just tired.
I'm gonna eat in my room.

532
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,711
Shit.

533
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,689
Guess who's getting married?

534
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:17,041
Ah! "Vincent Kruger and
fiancée Manon Fontaine.

535
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:20,419
"Spotted off the coast of Cannes
as they prepare for their big day.

536
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,546
"The upcoming nuptials are
rumoured to be taking place...

537
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,715
"at the Krugers'
19th-century château

538
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,260
"located within the exclusive
enclave of Cap d'Antibes."

539
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,179
We've got to get ourselves
invited to that wedding.

540
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,890
Why? We hate weddings.
It's the only thing we agree on.

541
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,543
Look at her neck.

542
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,228
- Pretty.
- Mm-hmm. What's round it?

543
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:41,148
- Nice.
- Mmm, nice in the region of 10 million.

544
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,359
Oh, very nice.

545
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,403
I'm pretty sure...
in fact, I'm positive

546
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,113
that's the Eye of the Rainbow.

547
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,990
- I thought I recognised it on her yesterday.
- Ah, the Eye of the Rainbow.

548
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,786
Yes, that sold at Sotheby's recently,
fetching a record price for a single stone.

549
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,955
When did you become such
a diamond aficionado?

550
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,791
Since the kids left home.
Daytime TV.

551
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,536
It's a mine of useless information.

552
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,922
- And, in this case, life-changing information.
- Indeed.

553
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:09,051
I bet she's gonna be wearing
that rock at the wedding.

554
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:14,674
That rock is our pension.
That rock is Doreen's pension.

555
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,885
We should nick it.

556
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,279
What?

557
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,990
It's just taking back what he's
taken from us and all the others.

558
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:31,991
You want to steal a diamond?

559
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,576
Richard, he's not gonna
give us our money back.

560
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,453
Well, that doesn't mean we
suddenly become the Pink Panther.

561
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,706
Why not? Richard, we are screwed.

562
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,541
We have nothing, literally nothing.

563
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,918
Nothing to give the kids. It's
time to take back what's ours.

564
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,961
I'm sick of these fat,
greedy, fucker billionaires

565
00:32:45,962 --> 00:32:48,883
taking all our money, just
ruining this country.

566
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:52,636
Well, not this country, actually, because
France has got great social services

567
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,263
and, my word, do they
run a good protest.

568
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,057
It's a stupid idea, Kate.

569
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,393
- Crazy, daft...
- All right, all right.

570
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,842
Stupid but brilliant.

571
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,816
- Brilliant idea.
- Yeah?

572
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,141
Why the hell not? If not now,
when? What have we got to lose?

573
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:13,824
- Apart from our dignity and our freedom.
- Exactly.

574
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,953
- Either way, it's worth investigating.
- Definitely. Let's investigate.

575
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,331
Well, it looks like we're
heading to the south of France.

576
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:24,236
Ah, together! What a good idea.

577
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,088
Delightful. Isn't she beautiful?

578
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,288
- She is.
- Shut up.

579
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,774
Yes, yes. Yes, I understand.

580
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:49,735
What do you mean,
they won't take it?

581
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,888
Cut it up?

582
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:58,232
Well, that's end of the credit
cards. Gone, kaput.

583
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,990
- Who are you texting? You're like a teenager.
- No one.

584
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,751
- She's gorgeous.
- Not my type.

585
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:09,296
Oh, right, yeah. Legs up to the
ceiling and arse as tight as a plum.

586
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,673
Of course she isn't.

587
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:17,012
Once maybe, but not anymore.
I like things a bit more... homely.

588
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:21,759
If that was an attempt to flatter
me, you can piss right off.

589
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,479
Look, the legs aren't nearly
as good in real life.

590
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,566
They've clearly been airbrushed.

591
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,442
- Steady. Handbrake off.
- I've got it.

592
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,652
It's off.

593
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,863
You've got it now.
OK. Where's she going?

594
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,891
Just try and look like a tourist.

595
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,002
- Check it out?
- Yeah.

596
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,593
Blimey!

597
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,569
You should go in there.

598
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,404
- Go and check the place out.
- I can't go in there.

599
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,977
Go on, go on.

600
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,423
Julie.

601
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,555
Laura.

602
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,899
And who are you?

603
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,320
Oh, <i>moi</i>? Er... me,
I'm Miriam from... Weymouth.

604
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,990
I'm your cousin...
well, second cousin,

00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:04,536
twice removed, on your husband's
side, future husband.

606
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,247

Ah, the champion!

626
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,771
Could I have a Martini, please?
A really big one. Thank you.

627
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,858
No, I don't know. I think I'm
making a terrible mistake.

628
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,651
- No!
- You're not, sweetie.

629
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:21,280
He's only using our wedding
as a business meeting.

630
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:24,408
He's got two Texans and
their wives coming.

631
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:28,412
We've never met them before and he
wants me to make sure they are OK.

632
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,038
Well, that's not right.

633
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,166
And he's putting them
up at The Carlton.

634
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,251
Lovely! The Carlton!

635
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,253
Hey, what do you think?

636
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,373
You're old. You must
have been married once.

637
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:43,162
Er... yes. Merci.

638
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:50,127
Old, old me. Er... what do I think?

639
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,978
Er...

640
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:59,307
I think that liking them is much more
important than loving them, actually.

641
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:04,031
Love is easy to fall into.
Liking is much harder.

642
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,617
Think of your wedding
as a driving test.

643
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:10,864
You take it, you pass, and then you
really start to learn how to drive.

644
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,454
Or you crash.

645
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,590
What about that diamond he
bought you? You like that.

646
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:24,665
- Yeah!
- Are you going to wear it at the wedding?

647
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,845
Not for the ceremony.

648
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,840
I'll change halfway through
the party and put it on then.

649
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,519
Hey, come on, girls, let's para!

650
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:46,687
I like you. You're honest.
I don't have girlfriends like that.

651
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,327
Good.

652
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,372

657
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:10,082
So shoot me. I nodded off.
It happens at my age.

658
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,723
And you were snoring.

659
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,475
Another unfortunate effect of age.

660
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,019
Look, can we just stop niggling
and tell me what you found out?

661
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,856
I found out that I
chafe very easily.

662
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,275
- Oh, my poor girl. I'm so sorry.
- Get off.

663
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,902
And the Wedding's
obviously invite only.

664
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,029
But she is definitely gonna
be wearing the diamond.

665
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,365
She's gonna change halfway
through the evening.

666
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,200
That sounds good. Anything else?

667
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,120
Not really, just that she's
pissed off with the evil one

668
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,664
for inviting a couple of Texan
businessmen they've never met before.

669
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,916
Of course she's pissed off. She'll
end up looking after their wives.

670
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,751
And she's right, it's
bang out of order.

671
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:43,122
She didn't happen to mention
where they might be staying?

672
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,007
'So what are we
stumbling into today?'

673
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,801
The Carlton Hotel, Cannes.
Their guest list.

674
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,179
We're looking for four guests
with home addresses in Texas.

675
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,389
'Dad, that is so illegal.'

676
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,893
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, son.
I wouldn't ask unless it was really...

677
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,812
'Dad, I'm only kidding. We do
that sort of shit all the time,

678
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,857
'messing with people's reservations,
putting people in the same room.'

679
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,859
- Not good, Matt.
- No, no.

680
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,728
'Hold on.'

681
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:10,980
- Do you think his eyes looked a bit red-rimmed?
- Just a little.

682
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,200
- Oh, he's not, is he?
- Yep.

683
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,835
- Tyler!
- Tyer! Oi!

684
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,004
Tyler! Tyler! Hello!

685
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,380
- 'Hello.'
- 'Hello.'

686
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,467
You've got to be kidding me!
You guys, again.

687
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,246
Nice to see you, Tyler.

688
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:36,391
'OK, we've got one Mr and Mrs
Hicks of Houston, Texas.

689
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,352
'They're assigned
to the Monet suite.

690
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,848
'And one Mr and Mrs Baxter. They're
across the hall in the Manet suite.

691
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:46,234
'Anyway, guys, I've got to go.
But the south of France?

692
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,487
'I am loving my new glam parents.

693
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,014
'See you later.'

694
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,161
- OK, so let me just get this straight.
- Hmm.

695
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:59,623
We are going to kidnap four
Texans, pretend to be them,

696
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,583
go to a wedding in a château,

697
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,795
somehow swap out the necklace,
and make our escape?

698
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,172
I know, it sounds absurd.

699
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:12,135
- Absurd, yes. Crazy, daft, stupid.
- All right, all right.

700
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,721
But brilliant.

701
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,348
- Yeah?
- One small problem.

702
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,142
There are four Texans
and we are but two.

703
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,011
Ah.

704
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:31,446

- Hello, old son!
- Welcome, welcome.

00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,490
- Good to see you, mate!
- Good to see you.

721
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,994
I cannot tell you how happy we
are to see you back together.

722
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,829
- Well, Pen...
- Yeah, it's great, isn't it?

723
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,290
And I don't mind telling you, it's
been an absolute nightmare for us,

724
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,708
having to choose between you.

725
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,334
Damn shame, the whole
bloody business.

726
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,158
Anyway, thrilled to be here,
glad to help. What are we doing?

727
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,297
Well...

728
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:40,170
- Kidnap? Stealing a diamond?
- Gatecrashing a wedding?

729
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,351
- Can we have... a moment?
- It's a lot to take in.

730
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:46,722
Talk about it. Go ahead.
I've got your bag.

731
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,430
What do you think?

732
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,974
- He's in. She's not.
- Probably.

733
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,741
Well... all right, we're in.

734
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,816
- Spot of lunch first?
- Yes!

735
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,843
Right. Everyone clear on the plan?

736
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:20,055
I tell you, I haven't been
this pumped since Shanghai.

737
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,014
Shanghai?

738
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,766
Yeah, you know, when I was
in the Merchant Navy?

739
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,768
- Merchant Navy?
- Woman in every port, eh, Jerry?

740
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:28,396
That sort of thing, yeah. It's
only a bit of boys' banter, Pen.

741
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,398
Pen, are you sure
these are gonna work?

742
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,192
Yes, three of those and
they'll be out like a baby.

743
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,985
- Five minutes tops.
- I can vouch for that.

744
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,905
- Who prescribes them for you?
- That lovely young Dr Jenkins.

745
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,532
Oh, yes. I've heard he's lovely.

746
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,868
Yes, terribly helpful.
And the warmest hands.

747
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,662
Excuse me?

748
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,539
How will we know who they are?

749
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,125
Well, I think we'll know.

750
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,001
Let's do this.

751
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,684

00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,855
Actually, I might go as well.

755
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,158
You know what?
I need one too, actually.

756
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,937
Well, it's never good to ignore it.

757
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:37,966

Oh, God, I hope we didn't
tie their hands too tightly.

772
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,691
Oh, do you think?

773
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:41,196
That was insane. I haven't had
this much fun since I was in Guam.

774
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:42,155
Guam?

775
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,324
I was stationed there
during my military service.

776
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,243
Oh, God!

777
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,744
Jerry! That's stealing!

778
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:51,081
Pen, Pen, Pen. This is real.
This is happening.

779
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:54,656
We either step up
or we get crushed.

780
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,836
- Silly man. Stop showing off.
- Right.

781
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:00,548
Let's pick up the replica necklace, back
to the hotel, cocktails and supper.

782
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,748
Yee-ha! Ride 'em, cowboy.

783
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,098
Jerry, how on earth did
you know where to find someone

784
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,058
who could make a replica necklace?

785
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:12,394
Well, you know...
I have my contacts.

786
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,688
Contacts? No, Jerry we don't.

787
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:19,150
Well, if you must know, I once
had a brief, er... affair of the heart

788
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,777
with a young jewellery designer.

789
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,823
Affair of the heart with
a young jewellery designer!

790
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:26,283
Calm down, Pen. It's all right.

791
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,965
Yeah, don't worry, Pen.
It's all in the past, all forgotten.

792
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,871
This is the basic
layout of the château.

793
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,999
Do you know where all
the guards might be?

794
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,584
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely, yes.

795
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,712
- No Jerry?
- No.

796
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,297
Rushed off while I
was having a bath.

797
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:44,301
Said he had to meet a man about
something. Very odd, the whole thing.

798
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,636
Anyway, don't let him spoil this.

799
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,306
This is lovely, seeing the two
of you being back together.

800
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:52,961
Sorry, everyone. Got held up.
Quick little mission.

801
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,855
I was just saying this is lovely and it's
lovely to see our friends back together.

802
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,691
- Pen, can we get back to the plan?
<i>- Absolument. Pardon.</i>

803
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:02,485
Now, this is where the guests
will be making their entrance.

804
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,696
And we will be required to
show our invitations here.

805
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:07,324
Now, you are going to be the
Baxters and we will be the Hicks.

806
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:10,285
- And actually, Matt... Cheers.
- Cheers, everyone.

807
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,537
Matt has done some
research into each couple.

808
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,164
- Hey! Your Matt?
- Our Matt.

809
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,249
- Such a bright boy.
- Thank you.

810
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,126
Not like our Tim, is he?

811
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,086
- That's disloyal, Jerry.
- Well, I was just being honest.

812
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,214
He's an academic disaster zone,
isn't he? Police tape all around him.

813
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,549
Jerry!

814
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,761
Now, we know that the bride will retire to
her bedroom at some point during the night

815
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:30,513
to change her frock and the new frock
will be accompanied by the diamond.

816
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,892
Now, hopefully, Richard and I will
have gained access through here.

817
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:37,520
We'll attempt to swap out the diamond,
delivering the real one into your arms, Jerry.

818
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,482
Now, you two will leave the party
early and if anything happens to us,

819
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,567
if we get caught, we're
just a disgruntled employee

820
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,860
and his pushy ex-wife

821
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,904
who've had their pensions
stolen and won't go away.

822
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:49,616
They'll find nothing on
us and they'll let us go.

823
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,326
- Right.
- Or they'll kill us.

824
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,161
Chop us up and throw us in the Med.

825
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,871
- Oh, God.
- Richard!

826
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:58,116
It's out there. It's a possibility.

827
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:04,130
Jerry, why do you keep winking at
Richard and patting your pocket?

828
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,716
What? What are you talking about?
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.

829
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,259
I know when you're lying.

830
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,470
Get off me, woman. Whey-hey!
What are you doing, woman?

831
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:13,465
- Hey! Ho-ho!
- God, he's got a gun!

832
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,183
What?

833
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,394
Don't advertise it to the
whole flipping restaurant!

834
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,771
Why have you got a gun and why
have you brought it to dinner?

835
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,481
- Are you crazy?
- Crazy? Me?

836
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:25,485
- Kate, Richard, talk to him.
- Jerry, actually, why have you got a gun?

837
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:29,531
It's a replica. Calm down. We just
thought it was a good idea, that's all.

838
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,408
It's a real one, actually. They
didn't have any replicas left.

839
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,744
- Bloody hell.
- We? So you're behind this brilliant plan?

840
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,955
Richard, have you led Jerry astray?

841
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:40,083
- What? No! It was his idea.
- Led me astray? I'm not a flipping child.

842
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,501
They were my contacts.

843
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:44,838
Jerry, where did you get this?
I demand to know!

844
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:49,092
Well, it's someone I
knew a long time ago.

845
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,928
I was passing through
France on my way to Guam.

846
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,889
How come I don't know anything about this?
I've been married to you for 35 years, Jerry.

847
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,350
- You've completely spoiled the whole evening.
- All right, love.

848
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,594
- Have some more wine.
- Just have a bit more wine.

849
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,730
Let's at least see it, then.

850
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,607
- Yeah, let's have a look.
- See what?

851
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,235
- The gun, Jerry.
- What? You want to see it?

852
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,696
- I do, actually.
- Let's have a look. Come on.

853
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,698
- Come on, then.
- All right.

854
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,701
- All right.
- Nobody's watching.

855
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,855
Hey-hey! Have a look at that.
All right, all right. One at a time!

856
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:22,030
Whoops, sorry.

857
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,237
Oh!

858
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,801
Freeze, you melon farmers.

859
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,636
- Steady, Pen.
- Oh, sorry.

860
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,762
Put it down.

861
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,082
Jesus Christ!

862
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,393
All right, er...

863
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,437
- Out the door. Shall we?
- Yeah. Drink up.

864
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,063
The bill, please.

865
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,024
Well, that was
something, wasn't it?

866
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,151
- Do you'll think we'll get arrested?
- No.

867
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,777
Oi, chaps, chaps. Good news.

868
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,822
I've just been talking to the owner.
Turns out we were in the Legion together.

869
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,408
He says if we, er... pay for
the wine, everything's OK.

870
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,452
- Fantastic.
- Oh, fabulous.

871
00:49:57,453 --> 00:50:01,581
- I feel a bit giddy, Jerry.
- Oh, I say! You all right there, Pen?

872
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,875
- Bedtime for us all.
- Right-o.

873
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,653
- Good night, then.
- Good night.

874
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:11,966
- What are you doing?
- Well... they seem so happy.

875
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,969
You know, with the idea of us.

876
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,639
I don't want to spoil it
for them, that's all.

877
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,059
Just... oh... just...

878
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,727
Just...

879
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,688
Oh... Oh!

880
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,137
Oh, that feels good.

881
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,309
Do you think we're
doing the right thing?

882
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:38,243
You know, diamond
stealing and kidnapping.

883
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:41,193
Without a shadow of a doubt.

884
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,408
Sit down for a minute.

885
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,794
I said sit.

886
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,967
Lying down is fine too.

887
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,395
Pen and I had a gin, doubles.

888
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:08,815
I just can't take it. I can't take my
booze anymore. That's the thing.

889
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:13,062
Well... it just whips my arse.

890
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:16,072
You're much more likeable
these days, you know?

891
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,942
That's nice. Thanks.

892
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,442
So are you.

893
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:26,446
We were much too young when we met.

894
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:31,326
We should have met now instead.

895
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,956
I don't think it works like that.

896
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,881
Why not?

897
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:49,844
Why did the latest one leave you?

898
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,638
She didn't, actually.

899
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,273
I left her.

900
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,654
Hmm.

901
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,875
- How's your back?
- Terrible.

902
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,404
How's your bunions?

903
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:14,282
Oh, excruciating.

904
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,452
Sweet dreams.

905
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,292
Night-night.

906
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,467
Oh.

907
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,521
- Oh, God! We didn't, did we?
- No.

908
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,721
Oh! Thank God.

909
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,361
You don't have to sound
so relieved about it.

910
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,117
Oh.

911
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:48,399
I haven't had sex for two years.
I'd like to have remembered it.

912
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:56,297
Jerry, try this. Please,
cos it's so juicy. Go on.

913
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,424
See what I mean? Gorgeous.

914
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,385
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Here he is.

915
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:01,594
- Hello.
- The stallion.

916
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,180
Didn't get much sleep last
night, old son, did you?

917
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,225
- Oh, Jerry.
- Oh, the old bed did shake, eh?

918
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:10,019
- Only my snoring, Jerry. That's all it was.
- Right you are.

919
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,064
Looks like we've got a bit of a problem.
Matt did some digging around last night.

920
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,566
Apparently there are going
to be fingerprint sensors

921
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,776
at the entrance to the party.

922
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,320
Everyone's going to be scanned
before they're allowed in.

923
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,906
- It's worse than Fort Knox.
- Mm-hmm.

924
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:25,652
We could shave off their fingertips
and stick them onto ours.

925
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,788
The Texans, I mean.
I saw it in a film once.

926
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,915
- Pen...
- Oh, sorry.

927
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,543
- I do get carried away.
- Good to think outside the box.

928
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,712
We should go with something a
bit more mainstream, though.

929
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,338
- Can everyone swim?
- Yes.

930
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,716
- How about climbing?
- Have you ever climbed, Jerry?

931
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,092
- He has not.
- Yeah, I have.

932
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,593
- I have.
- Jerry! When?

933
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:46,097
- When?
- I was in the Australian Parachute Regiment.

00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:03,646
Oh, we like fun, don't we?
Come along, missy.

997
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,846
Thank you. It's a
mighty fine château.

998
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,387
Mr and Mrs Beltrami, from Rome.

999
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:18,945
- I think that went quite well.
- For now.

1000
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,622
Let's blend in.

1001
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:25,167
Darling, I need to powder my nose. Would
you be so kind as to accompany me?

1002
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,294
- It would be my pleasure.
- Thank you.

1003
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,255
- Ey-up.
- Jerry!

1004
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:33,509
Merci. Well, Kate said
to blend in, didn't she?

1005
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,254
- Here's to us.
- Yeah.

1006
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,394
- Which floor?
- Second floor.

1007
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,263
Right.

1008
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,641
Right.

1009
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:53,226
Back in a tick.

1010
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:26,380
That's it, that's her
room. OK, Jerry. 30 seconds.

1011
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:30,357
Howdy, partner! How ya doin' there?

1012
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,527
- Come on.
- I'm looking for the old John Wayne.

1013
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:39,325
The, er... pissoir, the,
er... bog crapper? Any idea?

1014
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,195
Sorry, sir, downstairs.
This floor is private.

1015
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,920
Her window's open and there's
a ledge running to it.

1016
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,546
A ledge? Ledge?

1017
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,746
More like a balcony. Hold those.

1018
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,842
- Slow, slow, slow.
- I am going slow.

1019
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,736
- Don't look down.
- I'm not bloody looking down.

1020
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:18,185
Oh... Oh!

1021
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,450
Turn around, turn around.

1022
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:26,497
See? Turn around. There you go.
That's it. You're all right now.

1023
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:29,993
This is good. I got it.

1024
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,879
Well done. Well done.

1025
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,750
You're being very brave.
You're being very, very brave.

1026
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,791
- Oh!
- Oh!

1027
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,305
Oh, fuck!

1028
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,515
Wait, wait, wait.

1029
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,964
I've got you. I've got you.

1030
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:52,637
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1031
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,659
- Cats.
- And flowers.

1032
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:30,053
The 19th century.

1033
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,565
I'm gonna get changed.

1034
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:36,343
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

1035
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,848
Go with her.

1036
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,804
Ssh...

1037
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,534
I'm coming.

1038
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:32,907
Come in! <i>Entrez!</i>

1039
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:55,020
What?

1040
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,564
- You want to watch me get dressed now?
- Eh?

1041
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,933
Get out! Get out!

1042
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:12,647
She just... OK.

1043
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,653
Ssh!

1044
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,049
Oh, sorry. You're probably
wondering what I am doing.

1045
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:27,261
- It's not...
- I'm so glad you're here.

1046
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:28,595
Oh, there, there.

1047
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:33,684
Now, just sit down and tell Auntie...
Miriam all your worries.

1048
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:35,311
What's the matter?

1049
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:38,480
I've made a terrible mistake.

1050
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,234
He does not love me.
He never has and he never will.

1051
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,903
I've sold myself to the devil.

1052
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:49,158
- I'm a whore. I'm a devil's whore.
- No, no, you're not.

1053
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:52,161
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

1054
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,621
No, no, no, you're not.
Of course you're not.

1055
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:59,918
Yes, I am. I'm a terrible,
horrible, shallow person.

1056
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,546
I am a fake. I am a fake.

1057
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:06,008
I am a fake. I am a fake.

1058
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,509
No, don't say that about yourself.

1059
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,288
From what I can tell,
you're a highly original,

1060
01:04:10,289 --> 01:04:13,182
slightly highly strung,
bright, imaginative girl.

1061
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,641
- Really?
- Yes.

1062
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:17,102
- You really think so?
- I do. I do. Really.

1063
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:20,356
That is the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

1064
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:24,651
Oh, no! Oh, thank you.
Thank you, you're so nice.

1065
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,474
No, I'm not, really.

1066
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:36,038
Please excuse me.
I'll be right back. Sorry.

1067
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,362
There, there, Manon.

1068
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:41,043
Why are you crying?

1069
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:45,047
- Me? Oh, it's the flowers. I'm, er... allergic.
- Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry.

1070
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:47,091
- It's all right.
- Oh.

1071
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,385
No, no, no, Manon.
It's fine, really.

1072
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:54,917
- No, don't do that.
- Bloody things! I don't like them anyway.

1073
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,363
- What would you do?
- Me?

1074
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:13,784
Yes. You're clearly a woman of the
world. What do you think of him?

1075
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:15,411
- Your husband?
- Yes.

1076
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:20,040
- Well, I mean, he's fine. He's...
- Fine?

1077
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:22,709
Actually, I think
he's a bit callous.

1078
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:26,213
I'm sorry, I think
you could do better.

1079
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:28,006
I think he probably...

1080
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:31,552
I think he probably treats you
like a piece of jewellery.

1081
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:33,220
I think he probably
treats you badly.

1082
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:37,224
That's not to say he can't change.
I mean, they can change. People do change.

1083
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:42,729
But it's easy to say I love you while
you're rolling around on expensive sheets.

1084
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:46,600
It's so much harder
when they need washing.

1085
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:54,533
Look, I'm not who you think I am. I'm
sorry, I'm not Miriam from Weymouth.

1086
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:58,078
I'm not even Katie from Texas.
I'm just Kate from Surrey.

1087
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,873
And my ex-husband is lying on the
floor next to your bed, I'm afraid.

1088
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,708
- He is?
- Yep.

1089
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,612
Oh! Hello.

1090
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,672
- Hi.
- And why are you crying?

1091
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:11,300
The cats. But don't throw
them out the window.

1092
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:17,139
- Oh, he's really handsome.
- I know. It's irritating.

1093
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,850
- Not sure about the moustache.
- I agree.

1094
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:22,728
The thing is, you see, your
husband stole something from us

1095
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:24,438
and from a lot of other
very good people.

1096
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:27,733
Something very valuable
our future.

1097
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:34,364
And so we came here tonight to take
back what we feel is rightfully ours.

1098
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,366
Oh. The diamond.

1099
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:39,870
- It's not very imaginative, I grant you.
- Sorry, my back was killing me.

1100
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:45,876
- Manon, open up. It's Vincent.
- Take it. I don't like it anyway.

1101
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:48,746
Great. Here's the fake.

1102
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,382
Manon!

1103
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,704
What?

1104
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,808
Why are you throwing
flowers out the window?

1105
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:06,009
I'm allergic. Don't you
know anything about me?

1106
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:12,767
You must take good care of this.
It's not a toy, it's very valuable.

1107
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,364
More valuable than me?

1108
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:21,537
Darling, there is nothing on earth that is
more valuable to me than me... than you!

1109
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,940
You should know that.

1110
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:32,707
And will you still love me even
when we are washing the sheets?

1111
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,208
Ssh!

1112
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,062
What are you doing?

1113
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,981
I don't know. I thought
you were about to sneeze.

1114
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:52,226
- Causing a distraction's supposed to stop it.
- That's hiccups.

1115
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,850
Ah... yes.

1116
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:58,441
I might sneeze again.

1117
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:06,039
What are we doing?
We've got to get out of here.

1118
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,958
Oh, OK.

1119
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:10,236
- What, back the way we came?
- Yes!

1120
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:33,025
- Oh! Sorry, old partner.
- Sorry, sorry.

1121
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,552
Yeah, howdy.

1122
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:45,537
Although not on the official schedule, my
new wife would like to say a few words.

1123
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:54,171
A wise woman once told me that
you can love your husband

1124
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,465
but you must also like him.

1125
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:02,179
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1126
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:06,301
And I finally realised that...

1127
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:13,054
I don't love Vincent
or even like him.

1128
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:18,938
So Vincent, darling...

1129
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:22,316
I want a divorce.

1130
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:37,791
Stop! Stop! There's been
a travesty of justice.

1131
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,551
Catch them!

1132
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:42,919
Catch them!

1133
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:48,043
Hey! <i>Vive la révolution!</i>

1134
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,677
<i>Vive la révolution!</i>

1135
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:53,089
Oh!

1136
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,643
- Oh, my God, no!
- No, no.

1137
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,272
- Sorry, sorry.
- Sorry.

1138
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,039
Ooh! Ow!

1139
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,569
I knew there was something
familiar about you.

1140
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,461
Ooh!

1141
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,796
Ow!

1142
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,574
Oh, no! They're real.

1143
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:25,595
OK, let's make this simple.
Where is the real diamond?

1144
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,434
Bloody hell.

1145
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,277
- Oh!
- Oh, that's a whole other level of pain.

1146
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:45,240
Look, we're just a disgruntled employee and
his pushy wife who want back what's theirs.

1147
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,367
- You didn't say ex-wife.
- No, I didn't, did I?

1148
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:49,244
- Mmm...
- We should focus.

1149
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,898
- Right.
- Have you ever heard of karma?

1150
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:55,625
Perhaps you're being punished
for all the bad things

1151
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:58,779
that you might have
done in your life.

1152
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,534
It's just a thought.

1153
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:07,846
Oh, no! That's just mean!
You're just being a bully now!

1154
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:10,170
Be grateful, I don't hit women.

1155
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:15,050
Now, tell me where my diamond is!

1156
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,988
I swallowed it.

1157
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,874
I sold the diamond.

1158
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,209
What?

1159
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:40,284
I swapped it and sold the real one.

1160
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:45,967
Gave the money to charity,
an orphanage in Calcutta.

1161
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,636
What? Why?

1162
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:50,347
A test, to see if you
really loved me.

1163
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:53,266
You're crazy. I'll
deal with you later.

1164
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,920
Get rid of them.

1165
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,437
Oh, no.

1166
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,940
OK, er...

1167
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,526
If I'd known, I'd have
worn better underwear.

1168
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:05,111
I don't think it's your underwear
you should be worrying about, Pen.

1169
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,072
- These things reveal everything.
- What do you mean?

1170
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:10,101
- Yeah, every nook and cranny.
- Oh, God!

1171
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,400
What are you looking at?

1172
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,655
Damn cheek!

1173
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,802
Oh, yes, that's, er... Saigon,

1174
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:32,305
Vietnam, 1964.

1175
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,850
Took a bit of shrapnel, yeah.

1176
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:38,596
Bloody hell, they left some forceps
in there. Look, the clamp's in there.

1177
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,438
- I didn't know that.
- You can go.

1178
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:41,965
Bloody Vietnam.

1179
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,945
- Take them to the cliff.
- Huh? The cliff?

1180
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,656
Whisky? A last drink?

1181
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:52,158
Not my tipple.

1182
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:00,667
- I do hope they'll be all right, Jerry.
- I'm sure they'll be fine, love.

1183
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,445
- Do you think?
- Yeah.

1184
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:16,725
Stop whistling, Richard.

1185
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:19,853
- Please, stop whistling. It drives me mad.
- Helps me relax, Kate.

1186
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:22,564
Well, it doesn't help me relax.
It's driving me bloody mad.

1187
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,842
OK, I'll stop. I've stopped
whistling now, OK?

1188
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,208
We've stopped.

1189
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,031
Yes.

1190
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,749
- We're moving.
- Yes.

1191
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,731
- Kate.
- What?

1192
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,733
- I just wanted to say...
- What?

1193
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:08,944
I just wanted to say, Kate,
that whatever happens...

1194
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:13,521
- You're not trying to do a final speech, are you?
- No, not at all. Well, maybe a little.

1195
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:18,787
It's just that...

1196
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,413
- Shut up!
- All right, I will.

1197
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,321
Oh!

1198
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:29,949
- Oh!
- Oh!

1199
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:35,204
Don't... move.

1200
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:48,066
- Oh.
- Ohh!

1201
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:50,276
- What's going on?
- We're going back. We're going back!

1202
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,988
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh.

1203
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:55,391
No, no, no, no.

1204
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:59,160
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, Kate.

1205
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,537
What for?

1206
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:03,282
For not being a good husband.

1207
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:06,084
I'm sorry too, then.

1208
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:08,128
For what?

1209
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:09,879
For not letting you be one.

1210
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,673
What do you mean?

1211
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,508
- We were too young.
- Uh-huh.

1212
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:18,164
It takes two, you know, to totally ruin
a marriage, and I played my part.

1213
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,681
Oh, God!

1214
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:22,308
Anyway, what does it
matter now? We're...

1215
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:26,213
We're going to die!

1216
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:33,767
- Richard!
- It's OK. I've got you. Hold on.

1217
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:38,358
Kate, I think we should try again.

1218
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:42,120
- Try what again?
- Me and you.

1219
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:44,205
What are you talking
about, Richard?

1220
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:46,750
I think we should finally sail round the
world, like we've always talked about.

1221
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:48,877
I've had such a great
time these past few days.

1222
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:52,464
Could you just concentrate?
Concentrate on holding on!

1223
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:55,425
- Well, don't you feel anything, Kate?
- Yes, fear!

1224
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:57,874
All right. OK.
Well, just think about it.

1225
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:02,849
I like you, I really like you.

1226
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:10,674
Come on, you fucker!

1227
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,556
Come on!

1228
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,080
- Are you OK?
- Manon!

1229
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:29,084
- Manon!
- Oh! Oh, thank you. Thank you!

1230
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:33,004
Oh, no, it is I who should be thanking
you for making me see things clearly.

1231
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,422
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

1232
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,415
We must go. Help me.

1233
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,970
Here we go.

1234
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:00,406
- Nice girl, passionate.
- Oh, I do hope she'll be all right.

1235
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:02,980
Oh, a headstrong girl
like her, she'll be fine.

1236
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:04,911
We're gonna have to swim
out of here. You know that?

1237
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:08,414
- We'll be sitting ducks.
- Yeah, well, do you have a better idea?

1238
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:09,916
I know a man with a boat.

1239
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:11,239
- You do?
- Yeah.

1240
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,969
- Online?
- Yes, Richard, online.

1241
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:26,432
You chat, you get to know each other, and you
agree to meet up, if you like each other.

1242
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,726
- But you've never met him?
- No, not yet.

1243
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,436
So you don't even know
if you'll like him.

1244
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,147
Well, he's 57. He lives in Paris

1245
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,566
and has house and a boat in the
south of France. What's not to like?

1246
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:37,891
Good heavens, Kate!
How shallow you've become.

1247
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:43,650
That must be the captain.

1248
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:50,150
Bonjour, Kate.
It's me, Jean-Baptiste.

1249
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:53,034
Bloody hell!

1250
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:04,012
You know, I'm twice your age.

1251
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:07,098
What can I say? I like older women.

1252
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,559
Why lie on your profile?

1253
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:14,606
I want women to see me as a mature man.
Otherwise, I feel like a total cliché, you know?

1254
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:20,480
Young, rich, handsome, with a
speedboat... So terribly predictable.

1255
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:25,325
He's your lover?

1256
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:27,202
Ex-lover.

1257
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:29,571
But you still have
some feelings for him?

1258
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,453
I don't know.

1259
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:39,365
It's not good to look back.

1260
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:41,799
No, you're right.

1261
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,419
- It can make you feel a bit sick.
- Oh.

1262
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:50,850
Shall we head back?

1263
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:53,478
- Well, actually...
- We are going out.

1264
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:56,314
- Oh, really? Out?
- Yes, on a date.

1265
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:59,025
- Well, not a date. Not...
- Yes, a date.

1266
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:01,527
But what about the, er...

1267
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:03,154
diamond?

1268
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,398
You can handle that, can't you?

1269
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:09,035
Are you telling me you don't
want to see this through now?

1270
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:13,414
No, I... Well, I think so. I mean,
can't you deal with it on your own?

1271
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,613
I'll meet you at the
rendezvous in Paris.

1272
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,253
Right.

1273
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,838
Right, I see. Well...

1274
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:24,884
I suppose I did start all this for a
reason and the reason was for the...

1275
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:27,663
for the people, for...
for Doreen, for...

1276
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:32,642
Right, I'll be off, then.

1277
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:35,762
- You take good care of her.
- I will.

1278
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:47,282
So, first of all, we have
some champagne at my villa.

1279
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,493
OK. It's a bit early,
isn't it, for champagne?

1280
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:53,864
It's never too early for champagne.
It's always too late.

1281
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:58,001
Ah!

1282
01:19:58,002 --> 01:20:00,753
Oh, thank goodness. You made it.

1283
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:02,005
Where's Kate?

1284
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:04,590
Ah, she's not here.

1285
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:06,368
Where is she?

1286
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,594
- She's with a Frenchman.
- Oh!

1287
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:12,015
- What Frenchman?
- Jean-Baptiste.

1288
01:20:12,016 --> 01:20:13,725
You knew about him?

1289
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:16,102
Oh! Oh, right. Jean-Baptiste, yeah.

1290
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:18,438
Did everybody know about the
Frenchman apart from me?

1291
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:21,024
But why is she meeting him?
You're back together now.

1292
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:23,401
No, Pen, we're not back together.

1293
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:26,237
You seemed so happy so we
just went along with it.

1294
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,573
I suppose it was a bit
of a long shot anyway.

1295
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:31,909
Probably wouldn't have
worked second time around.

1296
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,995
Exactly.

1297
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:37,665
Anyway, the diamond. Where is it?

1298
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,043
- Ah, yeah.
- There's been a slight delay.

1299
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:43,539
Yeah, but... Pen's got me
on the old prune juice.

1300
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,840
Should get the bomb doors open.

1301
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:50,178
Maybe? No, false alarm.

1302
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:18,790
- Where are you going?
- Ah, good morning.

1303
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,659
There is a robe on the chair.

1304
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:31,094
- I'm so sorry about last night.
- Oh, Jean-Baptiste, it was lovely.

1305
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:34,749
- Yeah, but I drunk too much and...
- It happens. You're young.

1306
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:38,017
You've got much more experience
than me. That thing that you did...

1307
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:40,353
Oh, thank you.

1308
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:42,355
So, what would you
like to do today?

1309
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:44,607
We can have some
breakfast outside or...

1310
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:47,568
We can take my boat somewhere.
You can practise your French.

1311
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:50,976
Ooh.

1312
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,741
- You like this song?
- I love this song.

1313
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:56,577
- Who is it?
- Free. You know...

1314
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,955
♪ All right now ♪

1315
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:01,154
No, I don't know this band.

1316
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:05,154
No... of course you don't.

1317
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:13,261
It was the linseeds that ultimately
did it, such a smooth transition.

1318
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,804
- Well done, Jerry.
- Darling.

1319
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:18,141
Amazing. Look at it.
It's beautiful. Touch it.

1320
01:22:18,142 --> 01:22:20,294
No, I think I'll pass, Jerry.

1321
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:22,311
Thank you.

1322
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:25,773
Where is this man, Diamond Dave?

1323
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:28,302
Patience, my dear, patience.

1324
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:31,195
- I'm sure she's coming, Richard.
- Mmm.

1325
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:33,439
I don't think so, Pen.

1326
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:36,151
Thanks, anyway.

1327
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:40,830
I don't understand. What
is the Eye of the Rainbow?

1328
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:43,666
It's a diamond that we stole.

1329
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:49,213
But first we had to kidnap the Texans, scuba
to the chateau and break into a wedding.

1330
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:52,163
- You stole a diamond?
- Yes.

1331
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,596
- I'm not gonna make it.
- Yes, you will.

1332
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:10,568
It's Diamond Dave.
He hasn't changed a bit.

1333
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:13,893
- Don't take less than ten.
- Right you are.

1334
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:27,710
- I just don't get it.
- What, my love?

1335
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:29,921
How you know all these people?

1336
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:32,507
- Who?
- Well, Diamond bloody Dave.

1337
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:35,343
- Oh, you know, way back.
- No, I don't know, Jerry.

1338
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:38,930
I don't know about Saigon or
Guam or the Foreign Legion.

1339
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:42,600
- Or even Diamond bloody Dave. I really don't.
- It's all right. Calm down.

1340
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:45,686
No, I won't calm down.
Who are these people, Jerry?

1341
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:50,316
These contacts? All that metal
in your body? This past life?

1342
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:52,818
I thought I knew you.
I thought we were the same.

1343
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:55,313
Oh, Pen.

1344
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:01,312
I'm more than the sum of my parts.

1345
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:06,366
- What does that mean?
- I've got no idea.

1346
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:10,711
But what I do know
is that I love you.

1347
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:15,788
Always have, always will. OK?

1348
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:19,428
- OK.
- Yeah!

1349
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:22,799
- Got 15.
- Bloody hell.

1350
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:36,320
You can literally go anywhere
from here, can't you?

1351
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:39,190
Well, we've got a
briefcase full of cash.

1352
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:41,867
Penelope!

1353
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:44,316
There's one back to
London in 50 minutes.

1354
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:49,333
No, I don't think we
should get that one.

1355
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,532
- Kate!
- Hey-hey!

1356
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,965
Listen, what do you think about...

1357
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:59,745
I don't know, maybe doing a bit of
travelling before we head home?

1358
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,004
Travelling?

1359
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:06,851
- Well...
- Stupid idea, right?

1360
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,720
Yes.

1361
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:14,810
A crazy... daft... stupid...

1362
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:18,029
but brilliant idea.

1363
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:19,697
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Why the hell not?

1364
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:22,575
- What have we got to lose?
- Apart from our dignity?

1365
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:24,944
Either way, it's
worth investigating.

1366
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:28,357
Definitely. Let's investigate.

1367
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:31,792
Would you see that the
relevant people get this?

1368
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:33,044
It would be an honour, my friend.

1369
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:36,255
I've, er... taken a bit out. You can
stash the rest under the mattress.

1370
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:39,717
Don't worry, old pal. We've got a
safe house built under the stairs.

1371
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:42,496
- We do?
- Yeah.

1372
01:25:44,181 --> 01:25:46,379
<i>Bon voyage</i>, my old friends.

1373
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:48,934
- I'll feed the cat.
- Oh, thank you.

1374
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:50,436
- Look after yourselves.
- We will.

1375
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:51,646
Thank you.

1376
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:54,273
- Come along, Jerry.
- Be very, very naughty.

1377
01:25:54,274 --> 01:25:57,177
- It's is very heavy, Jerry.
- Hey-hey!

1378
01:25:57,736 --> 01:26:00,264
- Come on, my love.
- I say...

1379
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:03,392
Oh... yes.

1380
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:06,319
<i>Merci.</i>

1381
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:10,623
Come on.

1382
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:12,321
Come on!

1383
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:26,097
Oh, yay!

1384
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:27,682
Right. Yay!

1385
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:29,426

A wander around the Marais?

1392
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:03,785
Hmm, that would be nice.

1393
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:09,557
But... I was thinking of something
a little more adventurous.

1394
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:13,679
Adventurous? Marvellous.
When are we leaving?

1395
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:17,007

1404
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:40,504
- You bought us a boat!
- I did it!

1405
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:42,506
Don't fall in. Don't
fall in the Seine.
