Every 30 days.
You can set your watch.

180
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,235
He must've loved her very much.

181
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,857
I do admire his perseverance.

182
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,676
- Night of the living dead.
- I'll get him.

183
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,679
No, this is your second
double this week.

184
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,881
You got something more interesting?
Mel Gibson doesn't call.

185
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,317
I know that guy.

186
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,236
From where, prison?

187
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,105
High school.

188
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,766
I'll go get him, okay?

189
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,360
Tough night?

190
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,042
Coffee, please.

191
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:12,672
You really think you need it?
You got luggage under those eyes.

192
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,465
I'll bring you milk.

193
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:18,120
I don't want milk.
I'd like coffee, please.

194
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,432
How much sleep did
you get last night?

195

How long have you worked here?

198
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,990
Since the dawn of man.

199

MAN: Rita, bring me those checks.

200
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:56,507
My friend disappeared between
Mount St. Helene and Seattle.

201
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,331
That's about 60 miles from here.

202
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,337
I know.

203
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,301
What does your friend look like?

204
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,763
I know this is really
crazy, but I think...

205
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:20,938
If I remembered everyone who
came in, I'd be a freak of nature.

206
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,522
She's beautiful.

207
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,066
Yeah, I know.

208
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,626
What's your name?

209
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,279
Jeff.

210
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,382
- Shit!
- Don't worry about it. It's okay.

211
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:42,011
I'm not letting you get
into a car like this.

212
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:45,431
There's a nice, big cot in the back.

213
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:49,644
- Let me sit for a minute...
- You can't drive like this.

214
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:53,174
- You should be in bed.
- I'll be all right.

215
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,888
RITA: What do you do now?

216
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,267
JEFF: I was a copywriter,
but I lost my job.

217
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,060
- I'm sorry.
- No.

218
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:35,690
No, I'm writing a novel.
I couldn't do that if I was still one.

219
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,400
Why don't you take my number?

220
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,151
Don't give it to strangers.

221
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:43,398
I slept with you,
at least in the same room.

222
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:49,036
- That bed killed my back.
- Give me your arm. Turn around.

223
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,986
- What are you doing?
- Just relax, here.

224
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,657
Did it crack? Is it better?

225
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,509
I gotta clear more space.

226
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,596
Look what I found.

227
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:27,074
Why don't you talk about her anymore?
She was the No. 1 topic.

228
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:32,288
What's the point? To get upset?
To wind up all frustrated?

229
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:37,866
- It's weird how things just fade away.
- It's not faded.

230
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,118
Your stuff is in the top drawer.

231
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,676
RITA: What's in those boxes?
More crossword puzzles?

232
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:50,556
JEFF: Those aren't crossword
puzzles. They're anagrams.

233
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,351
Oh, anagrams.
That's really important.

234
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:58,439
It's mostly old stuff.
Just high school yearbooks.

235
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,942
- Really? Where? I wanna see.
- Now?

236
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:07,770
We have some unfinished business.
Don't go through my stuff. Rita!

237
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,284
- You okay?
- No.

238
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:15,441
- What is this? It almost killed me.
- It's nothing.

239
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,692
It's for protection.

240
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,537
There's a lot of psychos around.

241
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,214
It's loaded.

242
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:26,869
That's usually what psychos
respond to, honey.

243
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,764
Why didn't you tell me we have a gun?

244
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:35,768
You just moved in. You also
have to bang on the faucet.

245
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:39,173
Let's get one thing straight, okay?

246
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,984
No secrets, Jeff.
In the heart, on the lips.

247
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,682
Rita, I need it.

248
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,278
Fine.

249
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,451
Thank you.

250
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:09,040
Come on. No more secrets,
I promise, okay?

- Who's he?

256
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,822
A publisher. I gave him my book.

I'm sorry, Jeff.
I'm afraid it's not for us.

something else for us.

265
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,764
- Like an assignment?
- Exactly.

That was terrible.

269

I was in Tacoma at a wedding,
and I saw your posters.

I'd forgotten all about it,
but you're still looking.

00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,836
I tried not to come.
I almost went back home...

351
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,756
but if I did, I'd just
pack up and go.

352
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,249
Why didn't you?

353
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:28,350
Because I don't know
how not to fight.

354
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:31,519
Nobody in my family ever
fought for anything.

355
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,814
They wound up on Prozac
and sleeping all day...

356
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,525
or dead from liver disease at 35.

357
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:40,820
That's not gonna happen
to me, Jeff. I fight!

358
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,269
It's not her, Rita.

359
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:46,701
It hasn't been for a very long time.

360
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,194
Then what is it?

361
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:52,029
It's it. It's not knowing.

362
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:56,378
You know what I do?
I pretend I have a choice.

363
00:45:56,379 --> 00:46:00,784
Either to let her go on
living wherever she is...

364
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:03,134
and never know what happened...

365
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:08,211
or she can be dead, and I
get to find out everything.

366
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:11,840
So I let her die.

367
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:16,147
I swear to God, I wish she were dead.

368
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,518
You don't know what
it is like to not know.

369
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,897
Shit.

370
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:37,408
I'm sorry. But I don't
know what to do.

371
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,034
I do.

372
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:49,381
JEFF: I haven't been to
the gas station since.

373
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,018
I sent the manager posters.
He put them up.

374
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,811
I never went back myself.

375
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,805

376
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,366

She's gone, Jeff. Gone.

379
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:32,102
You may never find out how or why.
You have to accept that.

380
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,621
If Diane were here right now...

381
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:41,027
I'd ask you to marry me.
It's you I love, I swear.

382
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:44,587
But if it were possible
to choose right now...

383
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:48,299
I'd rather be back
at this gas station...

384
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,953
so I'd find out what happened.

385
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,002
It's not good enough.

386
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:58,435
If you ever wanna move
on with your life...

387
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,729
if you wanna be just alive again...

388
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,608
then this is your last chance.
I love you...

389
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:09,684
but you must decide to
be with me, or I'm gone.

390
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,566
Let her go, Jeff.

391
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:15,895
Let her go.

392
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,776

Hey.

396
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,254
Read it.

397
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,347
Go on. Come on.

398
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,279
He's watching me. I can feel it.

399
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,791
My fear was that he was dead.

400
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:30,992
But there are things in this
letter only he could know.

401
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:39,137
Jeff, he's seen your
picture in the paper.

402
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:42,849
He wants to see how far you'll go.
He's loving this.

403
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,351
No, look. He signed it. Barney.

404
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:49,973
- You think that's his real name?
- That's not the point.

405
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,685
You're right.

406
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:59,532
The point is, what am I doing here?
It's never gonna change.

407
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,785
It'll just go on until
you end up as crazy.

408
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,814
This letter's the
first break I've had.

409
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,750
I can nail this fucker!

410
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:12,496
Go to the police!
You can't do this on your own!

411
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:18,957
The police? They laugh at me.
I'm a joke to them.

412
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,749
I'm starting to see their point.

413
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:29,259
- Don't do this to me, not now!
- Jesus Christ, you are amazing!

414
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:33,392
Did it occur to you that she
doesn't wanna be found?

415
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:37,680
Goodbye, Jeff.

416
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:42,784
Run like a coward. At least
Diane was taken by force.

417
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:45,279
I am not Diane!

418
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:27,990
You've reached Jeff Harriman

She's left Jeff.

420
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:35,957
She's moving out, and she
will not be found here again.

421

- Did you rape her?

472
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:56,313
I'm not a rapist. It's important
that you understand that.

473
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,261
Then what did you do to her?

474
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:03,976
Let me tell you a story.

475
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:07,866
When I was 15,
it was an ordinary day...

476
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:12,454
I don't wanna hear your damn story.
I couldn't give a shit.

477
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,915
I wanna know what happened to her.

478
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,944
Then you'll want to
listen to the story.

479
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,868
You want to listen carefully.

480
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:26,161
Sometimes the devil
is in the details.

481
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,499
Now, once, when I was 15...

482
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,727

<i>Something willed me to

485
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:51,152
<i>I wondered if I had
the courage to jump.</i>

486
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:57,283
<i>I kept waiting for something
to stop me. Anything.</i>

01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,282
<i>But nothing did.</i>

488
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,617
<i>And so I jumped.</i>

489
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:15,434
Everybody has had that thought
at one time, but I did it. Why?

490
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:19,605
Because you're a nut case.
I wanna know where Diane is!

491
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:21,899
You're still not listening.

492

Be careful.
The answer will slip by you.

493
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,904
Go on.

494
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:30,991
I lead a very normal life.
I work. I have a home.

495
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,235
But then, one day...

496
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:37,449

family in California...

497
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:41,418

In that moment,
she thought I was a god.

506
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:25,337
That would make most people
feel great, but I panicked.

507
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:30,494
- What does this have to do with Diane?
- Diane was an experiment.

508
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:37,383
Saving a life made me a hero,
but did it make me a good person?

509
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:41,645
I had to prove to myself
beyond a doubt...

510
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:46,817
that I was as capable of
evil as I was of heroism.

511
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:48,765
Real evil.

512
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:54,616
The worst thing. Or I wouldn't
deserve my daughter's love.

513
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,815
You're fucking insane.

514
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,831
You killed Diane.

515
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:06,079
For me, to kill is not the worst
thing that I could imagine.

516
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,745
There's more to know.

517
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:24,589
Tell me what happened.
I won't say a word.

518
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:29,723
You won't because if you do
you won't get what you need.

519
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:42,740
- Something wrong, officer?
- You have a broken taillight.

520
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:50,631
I don't know what to say.
There's nothing criminal on the tape.

521
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:55,511
We'll conduct a search, but he
has to be missing 24 hours first.

522
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,971
Twenty-four hours? Jesus!

523
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:01,975
What is this? Gotta give
out parking tickets first?

524
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,602
Lynn, please.

525
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:05,687
How much have you had to drink?

526
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:09,638
One after another.

527
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,654
Get that taillight fixed.

528
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:16,323
Yes, officer. Will do. Thank you.

529
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:18,146
Drive safely.

530
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,960
- Problem?
- Your seat belt.

531
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:32,241
- I'm claustrophobic.
- Just put it on.

532
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:34,033
Yes, sir.

533
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:18,051
Miss Carmichael? It's Rita!
Are you there?

534
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:21,638
Please come to the door!
I need to talk to you!

535
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,015
Magically delicious.

536
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:26,795
Miss Carmichael!
Can you come to the door?

537
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,938
What's the ruckus?
You're gonna wake Elvis.

538
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,969
Great. Miss Carmichael,
this is very important.

539
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:40,146
Did you see Jeff here today?
Did you see anything unusual?

540
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:44,661
- You mean the fight with Barney?
- Yes!

541
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:47,110
What fight? Tell me about it.

542
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:49,400
Nothing to tell.

543
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:53,670
Your boyfriend was whopping
that man's head...

544
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,757
got in the car with
him and drove off.

545
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:58,175
Oh, God!

546
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:02,581
Okay, what else? Do you
remember anything else?

547
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,932
Yes, come to think of it, I do.

548
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:09,428
- Something odd.
- What?

549
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,855
In the middle of everything...

550
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:16,151
that leprechaun popped
off my Lucky Charms box...

551
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,930
and started dancing around.

552
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:22,649
"Magically delicious!"

553
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:25,653
Thank you.

554
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:31,583
If you wanna know the license plate
number of the car, let me know.

555
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,531
Wait, wait, wait.

556
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:37,706
It's very urgent. Please!
I'll be one minute.

557
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:41,036
One minute. Please? Thanks.

558
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:46,473
- Sir! Sir, my car was stolen.
- Your car was stolen?

559
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:51,801
The license plate is 155INY.
I've already been to the police.

560
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:09,230
Mrs. Cousins? Helene Cousins?

561
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:12,916
Yes...

562
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,536
You may still have my old address.

563
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,618
1804 Northwest Everett Drive.

564
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:26,430
- Seattle.
- New one. Thanks.

565
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:28,799
You gotta fill out this form.

566
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:44,156
I was having no success.

567
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:46,950
My methods needed to be rethought.

568
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,618
And then...

569
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:53,320
my family gave me a little
party on my birthday.

570
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:57,077
Okay, move in.

571
01:10:57,503 --> 01:11:00,406
Right, little closer.

572
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,371
Smile!

573
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,765
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Barney.

574
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:12,089
Blow out the candles, Daddy.

575
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,152
Thank you.

576
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:36,909
Forever.

577
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,537
More?

578
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:58,677
I'm afraid to open it.

579
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,553
Let's see.

580
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:05,684
What happened to me?

581
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:24,248
- What happened, Daddy?
- You fell off the balcony.

582
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,873
<i>BARNEY:
And that's when it dawned on me.</i>

583
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:35,130
<i>It wasn't the lure that had to
be stronger. I had to be weaker.</i>

584
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,064
Excuse me.

585
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:56,288
I've opened mine with a
barrette a million times.

586
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:59,283
- This way?
- Yes.

587
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,932
Bless you.

588
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:35,861
Excuse me. I have to go to the
men's room. I don't feel so well.

589
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,850
I'd given up for the day.

590
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,727
It was comical.

591
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:04,177
I didn't trust myself not
to laugh the next time.

592
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,721
<i>Fate, Jeff.</i>

593
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:39,216
<i>If I hadn't sneezed...</i>

594
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:56,116
- I'm sorry.
- Quite all right.

595
01:14:56,117 --> 01:15:00,147
I was just wondering if
you had five singles.

596
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:05,834
Three ones.

597
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:11,583
Just a normal single you could trade
me for my mangled one. Thank you.

598
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:13,909
Could you...?

599
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,752
Sorry.

600
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,584
Thank you.

601
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:21,084
Okay, now let's see if this works.

602
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:26,259
This is your lucky day.
I can feel it.

603
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,517
Thank you.

604
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,944
That's a beautiful bracelet.

605
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:36,690
Thank you. That's the
symbol for infinity.

606
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:40,368
I suppose it means
it'll stay forever.

607
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:43,147
Well, it's a nice thought.

608
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:49,044
My boyfriend would really
appreciate something like that.

609
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:51,573
Where'd you get that?

610
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,834
I rep them.

611
01:15:56,218 --> 01:16:00,013
I handle sales for the
whole Northwest Territory.

612
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:01,389
Wow!

613
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:06,512
If you promise not to tell the
next time you're in Paris...

614
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:10,273
I'll let you have a sample for cost.

615
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:13,644
- They're in my car.
- Really?

616
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,653
With a new product...

617
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:20,776
it's a good idea to have people
seen wearing it around town.

618
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:25,205
- Twenty-two bucks.
- That's cheap.

619
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:30,703
If I told you the markup we get for
these, you'd die. You want one?

620
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,577
Yes.

621
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:37,667
Right this way.

622
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:02,813
There they are.

623
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,569
Please.

624
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,914
They're called "tiles" in French?

625
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:12,695
That's the name of
the company. <i>Teels.</i>

626
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:17,082
<i>Un tile</i> infinity, please.

627
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:22,087
Could you get in and give me a hand?

628
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:25,374
- Get in?
- Yes.

629
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,934
[SCREAMS]

630
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:29,529
Why did you make contact with me?

631
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,617
Because you asked.

632
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:39,410
The way you searched for Diane.

633
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:42,884
Such a worthy opponent.

634
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:45,208
A kindred spirit.

635
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:52,132
You don't meet many men who
refuse to give up or be dominated.

636
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:55,263
Most just crouch
frightened in the dark.

637
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,571
Excuse me.

638
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:08,478
I'm looking for Mr. Cousins.
I saw you come out of his house.

639
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:14,116
I know who you are.

640
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:15,950
You do?

641
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:20,672
Yeah, I saw him watching
you this afternoon...

642
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:22,746
at the restaurant.

643
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:25,457
Come in out of the damp.

644
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:35,846
I'm Rita.

645
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:40,142
I'm Denise.

646
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,847
Are you going to run away together?

647
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:47,979
Um...

648
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:52,354
It's complicated.

649
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,445
Where is he now?

650
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:01,823
- At the cabin.
- The cabin? I forgot.

651
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:06,831
Don't you wanna be together forever?

652
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,393
That's the symbol for infinity.

653
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:19,897
I gave it to him on a
bracelet for his birthday.

654
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:22,025
Look, I wanna go to him now.

655
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:26,181
But I'm not sure I can
find my way. It's dark.

656
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:28,440
Can you tell me the way?

657
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,857
Come on. You can drop
me off on the way.

658
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:37,408
I'm meeting a boy. Daddy has no idea.

659
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:43,288
Mother's asleep. Daddy says
romance has to be secret.

660
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:48,828
- You won't tell him, will you?
- No, I won't tell him.

661
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,223
JEFF:
I wanna know what you did with her.

662
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:56,092
I'll tell you.

663
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:58,712
I will keep my promise.

664
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:01,890
But there's only one way to do it.

665
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:06,554
You must experience
what she experienced.

666
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,855
What do you mean?

667
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:14,482
Everything that happened to her,
every event from this point on...

668
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:17,155
you must duplicate exactly.

669
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:18,706
You're crazy.

670
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:22,126
If you do, logic dictates
you'll find her.

671
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:23,653
Alive?

672
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,535
This coffee is drugged.

673
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,596
Judging from your size...

674
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:37,016
it would take 15 minutes
to take effect.

675
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:40,512
It'll put you out for
40 minutes or so...

676
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:43,973
the same length of
time Diane was out.

677
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:48,762
You must remain unconscious
for us to move on.

678
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:52,019
So she's not dead?

679
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:53,938
Drink.

680
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:56,736
And afterwards, what?

681
01:21:56,870 --> 01:22:01,446
Drink and you will experience
exactly what she experienced.

682
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:24,939
You don't understand. I won't
tell anyone. I just want to know.

683
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,013
I understand.

684
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:31,309
And when I put myself in
your place, I believe you.

685
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:34,649
That's why I don't need a gun.

686
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:38,065
Your obsession is my weapon.

687
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:41,831
It's like you are my laboratory rat.

688
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:45,406
I provided the materials.
You've built the cage.

689
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:49,702
Only now, you can't escape
what you've constructed.

690
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:55,253
If you want to know
what happened to her...

691
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:59,250
you have to go through
the same things.

692
01:23:07,608 --> 01:23:10,602
The key chain,
I'd like to see it again.

693
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:29,909
Jeff, look at your life.
You have nothing. No job.

694
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:32,494
No money.

695
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,747
No love.

696
01:23:37,804 --> 01:23:40,127
No peace of mind.

697
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:45,228
It's been three years of hell.

698
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:50,483
At what point do you say,
"I'm not going to be over this"?

699
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:56,072
There were nights with Diane I'd
pray she'd get into an accident...

700
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:59,325
just so she'd let me
take care of her.

701
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:02,479
Just so she'd have to stay with me.

702
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:06,082
You don't care if
she's alive or dead.

703
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:07,375
I do.

704
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:11,796
You're afraid that you
won't know who you are.

705
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:15,591
Who is Jeff if he's not the
guy looking for Diane?

706
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,414
Please.

707
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:21,957
Can you walk away from
knowing the answer?

708
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:27,937
Please, I just wanna know
what happened to her.

709
01:24:27,938 --> 01:24:32,684
Drink, Jeff, really.
What choice do you have?

710
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:25,703
I said I'd show you what
happened to Diane...

711
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:28,573
and I'm a man of my word.

712
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:43,580
No!

713
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:40,725
Help!

714
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:56,574
Diane.

715
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:04,660
Oh, shit!

716
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:08,201
Hello, Rita.

717
01:29:08,635 --> 01:29:11,333
I really dislike surprises.

718
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:54,251
Rita?

719
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,925
It's me! Come out.

720
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:02,464
You can't possibly win.

721
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,683
You don't know how.

722
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,804
Your hiding is pointless.

723
01:30:10,864 --> 01:30:14,063
I know these woods inside and out.

724
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,687
They're like a maze.

725
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:25,245
You must come out if
you want to find Jeff!

726
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:28,414
That's why you came, after all.

727
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:12,675
Where's Jeff?

728
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:14,578
Where?

729
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:19,723
Do what you want.
You'll never know what happened.

730
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:25,005
If anything happens to me, all you'll
have is your same uncertainty.

731
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:31,391
- Your choice.
- I'll take my chances.

732
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,573
Jeff?!

733
01:31:58,013 --> 01:31:59,790
Jeff!

734
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:05,006
Jeff, are you here?

735
01:32:07,814 --> 01:32:09,773
Jeff!

736
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:11,676
Jeff!

737
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:32,955
Jeff!

738
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:52,971
Hello?

739
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:55,269
Hello?

740
01:32:56,279 --> 01:32:57,771
Hello?

741
01:33:02,035 --> 01:33:04,904
<i>Operator 319. What city, please?</i>

742
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:09,651
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

743
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:24,924
Feeling strange?

744
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:45,812
This is silly, Rita.

745
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:49,733
You can't fight.

746
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:44,499
No!

747
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,818
BARNEY: How did you follow us?

748
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:43,937
Did you see us leave?

749
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:56,526
The important thing is that
it was all Jeff's choice.

750
01:35:59,045 --> 01:36:02,619
Coming to the restaurant,
getting in the car...

751
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,789
drinking the coffee.

752
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:08,253
He did what he wanted to do.

753
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:15,511
You're feeling better, aren't you?

754
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:21,275
I know how long the
chloroform effects last.

755
01:36:21,276 --> 01:36:24,179
You'll soon be strong
enough to fight.

756
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:30,025
Well, I'm sorry, but...

757
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:34,188
I'm just not up to it.

758
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:36,498
And besides...

759
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:40,904
I have to get home
before my wife wakes up.

760
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:44,494
Tell me what you did to Jeff.

761
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:49,916
You took your chances.

762
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,248
Is he dead?

763
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:57,595
I made him a cup of coffee.
It was drugged.

764
01:37:02,692 --> 01:37:07,939
To find out what happened,
he had to go through what she did.

765
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:13,277
And now you must do the same.

766
01:37:20,209 --> 01:37:24,409
This can be easy,
or this can be hard.

767
01:37:24,547 --> 01:37:26,620
Your choice.

768
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:36,130
Don't worry. It won't keep you up.

769
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:34,900
Tell me, Mr. Cousins. Have you
spoken to your daughter tonight?

770
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:40,414
What? How do you know my name?

771
01:38:40,415 --> 01:38:44,418
I know your family's names,
Barney. Wife, Helene.

772
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:46,446
Daughter, Denise.

773
01:38:47,255 --> 01:38:51,626
Sweet, innocent,
13-year-old daughter, Denise.

774
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:55,626
Brown hair, full of secrets.

775
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:58,294
I've got her.

776
01:39:03,312 --> 01:39:07,357
What are you up to?
How were you able to follow us?

777
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:09,601
Denise knows the way.

778
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:14,686
I took your daughter
tonight to trade for Jeff.

779
01:39:18,161 --> 01:39:22,407
A brave attempt, but we
both know it's not true.

780
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:30,839
Let's talk about the mistress
she wants you to have.

781
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:33,038
<i>Wuthering Heights.</i>

782
01:39:35,011 --> 01:39:38,335
Or better yet,
let's talk about infinity.

783
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,269
Helene, it's me.

784
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:29,856
<i>HELENE: Is Denise with you?
Her bed hasn't been slept in.</i>

785
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:34,228
<i>I got up to close the windows
and she wasn't there...</i>

786
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:40,142
That's right, shithead.

787
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:45,235
Where is she?
What did you do with her?

788
01:40:46,499 --> 01:40:51,245
If you wanna know, you'll have
to go through what she did.

789
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:56,675
- Drink.
- You can't be serious.

790
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:58,419
Try me.

791
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:00,750
- If you think...
- Drink!

792
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:03,381
Now!

793
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:40,953
To your health.

794
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:51,612
Jeff! God, hold on!

795
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:09,091
Jeff, hold on! Hold on!

796
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:29,653
Jeff, hold on!

797
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:51,675
Oh, Jesus!

798
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:57,605
God, be alive! Be alive.

799
01:43:57,606 --> 01:43:59,349
Be alive!

800
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:04,434
Rita?

801
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:11,327
I've got 15 minutes
to find her, Rita!

802
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:13,788
- Son of a bitch!
- Where is she?

803
01:44:13,789 --> 01:44:17,000
- You killed him!
- I have no time to mess around!

804
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:21,076
- Get off of me! Bastard!
- Tell me where she is!

805
01:44:21,422 --> 01:44:24,245
- Tell me where she is!
- No!

806
01:44:25,217 --> 01:44:27,335
Where is she?

807
01:44:30,723 --> 01:44:32,340
Help!

808
01:44:38,147 --> 01:44:41,274
I've got 15 minutes
to find her, Rita!

809
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:43,097
No, don't!

810
01:44:43,819 --> 01:44:45,766
[SCREAMING]

811
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:50,942
[GROANS]

812
01:45:21,941 --> 01:45:25,185
It's over. It's over.

813
01:45:45,923 --> 01:45:48,075
You all right?

814
01:45:58,894 --> 01:46:02,814
There was a terrific story
there before, but now...

815
01:46:02,815 --> 01:46:05,843
I think it's an out-and-out smash.

816
01:46:05,985 --> 01:46:09,612
- I need for you to write it.
- I don't think so.

817
01:46:09,613 --> 01:46:12,615
We wanna put the
whole thing behind us.

818
01:46:12,616 --> 01:46:18,068
Look, I know I'm being gauche,
but I'm a publisher.

819
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:23,319
Write this book, please.
You won't regret it.

820
01:46:23,419 --> 01:46:25,196
What do you say?

821
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:29,457
- No coffee.
- We don't drink that anymore.
