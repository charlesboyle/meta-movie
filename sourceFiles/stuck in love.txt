1
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:41,668
[boy]
I remember that it hurt.

2
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:45,214
Looking at her hurt.

3
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:05,442
Your... your...
your nose.

4
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:09,947
[whispers]
Oh, oh, it does that sometimes.

5
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:14,576
[school bell rings]

6
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:26,380
- Hey.
- Hi.

7
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:36,265
I never enjoy anything.

8
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:39,142
I'm always waiting for whatever's next.

9
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:40,644
I think everyone's like that...

10
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:42,187
living life in fast forward,

11
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:43,855
never stopping to enjoy the moment,

12
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:46,275
too busy trying to rush through everything,

13
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:49,778
so we can get on with what we're really
supposed to be doing with our lives.

14
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,990
I get these flashes of clarity, brilliant clarity,

15
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:55,158
where, for a second, I stop and I think,

16
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:57,327
"Wait, this is it.

17
00:01:57,411 --> 00:02:00,038
"This is my life. I'd better
slow down and enjoy it,

18
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:03,000
"because one day, we're all
going to end up in the ground,

19
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,335
"and that will be it.
We'll be gone.

20
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,840
So I think we should fuck.
[chokes]

21
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:12,092
Um... what?

22
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,761
Let's just fast forward through all
the drunken seduction bullshit...

23
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,680
we have to look forward to.

24
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:19,224
You don't look like you'd be very good at it anyway,

25
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:21,935
and I don't want to sit here and listen
to you bumblefuck your way through it.

26
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,146
We both want the same thing,

27
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:26,898
to go back to your room, have sex,
and never see each other again.

28
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:28,150
Are you with me?

29
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,609
Is this a trick?

30
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:31,111
The offer is about to expire.

31
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:32,571
No, no, I'm in.

32
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:33,864
I'm definitely in.

33
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:41,121
Do you like that book?

34
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:42,831
No, God, no.

35
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:45,959
No, it's my idiot brother's favorite book.

36
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:47,878
Is it yours?
No, no.

37
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:49,379
It's my roommate's.

38
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:52,883
I'm not really much of a reader.

39
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:55,177
Good.

40
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:00,015
Now come here.
Yes, ma'am.

41
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:39,721
[man and woman talking inside]

42
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:42,641
[couple arguing]

43
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:04,496
As I stood there staring through the window

44
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,456
into my ex-wife's
new life,

45
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,334
I was overcome by the oddest sensation.

46
00:04:09,418 --> 00:04:12,838
Watching her with this man was
like turning on a familiar sitcom

47
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:17,092
and realizing they had replaced one
of the lead actors with a stranger.

48
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:20,220
The show was the same, but the
thespian who played William Borgens

49
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:23,306
for nearly twenty years was gone.

50
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,476
And in his place was a younger, dumber model.

51
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,522
[barks]
[gasps]

52
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,023
[man]
What was that, boy?

53
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:32,983
Oh, shit.

54
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:38,947
[barking, man yelling]

55
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,284
Down! Heel! Fucking dog!

56
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:19,237
Rusty...

57
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,043
Oh yeah.

58
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,173
There you go.

59
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:45,013
You got that bowl?

60
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,192
Hey.

61
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:20,632
Just rock it on there.
Get him on there.

62
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,050
Gentle, gentle.
There you go.

63
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,885
Got it?
Don't push that hard.

64
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:25,053
All right.

65
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:27,305
There we go.
Yeah.

66
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:51,871
[knocking]

67
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:53,748
[knocking again]

68
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:55,542
Dad, she's here.

69
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,962
[knocking]

70
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:00,589
Ready?

71
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:03,758
Hi, I'm back.

72
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:09,514
Dad...
[knocking]

73
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,270
Smells good.

74
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:23,486
Well, they said that you have to go back there?

75
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,949
They just said that I think you
might have to end up paying for it.

76
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:30,744
No, but they're going to cancel
the whole thing? The appointment?

77
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:32,996
Yeah, they're canceling it.
It's over, basically...

78
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,874
My book is being published!
[chokes]

79
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:41,504
Oh, my God.
Congratulations.

80
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,423
Thank you. Thanks, Dad.
Oh, my God.

81
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,258
We're so proud of you.

82
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:46,718
What house is it?
Scribner.

83
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,762
What?
That's King's publisher.

84
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:50,764
Yeah, no,
they're great. Great.

85
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:53,433
We got to have a toast. We have
to have a toast. Scribner?

86
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:56,853
Yeah, that's exactly what I was
thinking when I submitted the book.

87
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:59,147
This will really piss Rusty off.

88
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,484
It's not because they publish books
by Hemingway or Kurt Vonnegut.

89
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,319
David McCullough, Frank McCourt.

90
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:07,530
F. Scott Fitzgerald,
Bob fucking Dylan.

91
00:08:07,614 --> 00:08:09,282
I didn't know you had dibs on Scribner.

92
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:10,909
I never said I had dibs, Samantha.

93
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,661
I just was...
You're just jealous.

94
00:08:12,744 --> 00:08:14,079
Wow.
I'm not jealous.

95
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:16,122
What an accomplishment.

96
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:18,458
Your sister is having her first
book published, all right?

97
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,168
This is a cause for celebration.

98
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:21,878
This is what the holidays are all about.

99
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:23,421
Okay, cool.

100
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:24,964
You might want to congratulate her.

101
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:27,092
Congratulations.
Thank you.

102
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:29,511
Geez, I didn't have my first book published until...

103
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:33,306
I don't know.
I was 25 or 26.

104
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,933
I would have been happy to call those guys.

105
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,393
I know them all over there.

106
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,061
I submitted it under a fake name

107
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:39,854
and didn't tell them whose daughter I was

108
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:41,940
until after was accepted.
I wouldn't have minded.

109
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:43,817
I know. I just... Because you
wanted it to be about your book

110
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,527
and not about being my daughter.

111
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,947
Yeah. Okay, well, this
is a toast... psst.

112
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:52,534
To you and your first novel.

113
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,536
Just Saying Hi.

114
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:57,831
Oh, it's not Just Saying Hi.

115
00:08:57,914 --> 00:08:59,708
Did they make you change the title?

116
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,168
No, they're not publishing Just Saying Hi.

117
00:09:02,252 --> 00:09:04,212
It's a different book.

118
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:06,381
What?

119
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:09,718
I put that aside for now,

120
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:11,261
and I wrote a new one.

121
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:12,595
When?

122
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,222
Over the summer.

123
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:15,598
What happened to Just Saying Hi?

124
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:17,559
You were excited about that.

125
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:19,519
I was excit-- I put a lot of
work and effort into that.

126
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,062
I proofed the manuscript and I--

127
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:22,814
I know.
I'm sorry. I--

128
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:25,108
I..I..I thought my opinion
meant something.

129
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,485
It does. Dad.
You know it does.

130
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:30,155
And yet you turn around and write an entirely new book

131
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:32,157
and don't think to share it with me?

132
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:35,577
I'm sorry.
[sighs]

133
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:40,623
Something's burning.

134
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:48,548
Congratulations.

135
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,509
Why would you let him set that place at the table?

136
00:09:51,593 --> 00:09:53,303
I set it.
He asked me to.

137
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:55,096
Yeah, well, she's not coming.

138
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,098
I'm about to head over there.
You should come.

139
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:58,391
Give Dad a chance to cool off.

140
00:09:58,475 --> 00:09:59,809
I'm not going over there.

141
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:01,144
Fine.
Suit yourself.

142
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:02,562
I'll tell her you said hi.

143
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:04,063
You can tell Mom to drop dead.

144
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:06,608
[inhales]
Whoa...

145
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:14,407
[car radio]

146
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,216
This food is so good.

147
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:35,303
[mother]
Glad you like it.

148
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:37,430
So how did everything go over at your Dad's?

149
00:10:37,514 --> 00:10:41,309
It was good. Sam's getting
a book published.

150
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:43,394
What?

151
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:45,313
That was my reaction, too.

152
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:47,732
That's great.

153
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:50,777
I always thought your dad making you
and your sister keep journals was...

154
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,738
a little strange, but...

155
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:55,490
sounds like it's paying off.

156
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,242
I can't believe it.

157
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,576
Rusty, just let that go.

158
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,453
No, why is it strange?

159
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:02,497
I just want to know why you think it's so strange.

160
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,916
Well, it just seems like he was forcing you

161
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,584
to be writers...

162
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:08,628
instead of allowing you to choose to be.

163
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:10,545
We don't have to keep the journals if we don't want to.

164
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,423
You'd have to get a job if you stopped.

165
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:14,551
He pays us to do it so we can focus on our writing

166
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:16,761
instead of working some bullshit job at McDonald's.

167
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:19,180
Rusty...

168
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:21,307
What?

169
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:22,684
What?

170
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,185
Are you stoned?

171
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:26,271
Are you kidding?
Are you being...

172
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:29,190
I'm not stoned. Rusty, I'd like
to talk to you in the kitchen.

173
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:30,942
I think you're stoned.

174
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:33,069
Great. Good.
I'm going.

175
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:37,657
[sighs]

176
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,701
What's gotten into you?

177
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:41,452
I'm not going to let that Neanderthal...

178
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:43,580
talk about Dad like that.

179
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:45,373
He didn't say anything about your father.

180
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,667
It's not what he says.

181
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,378
It's how he talks about him like he's
some sort of weirdo or something.

182
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,255
And watching football doesn't make you a Neanderthal.

183
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,464
Owning his own gym does.

184
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,258
Okay, enough.
Enough.

185
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,390
Is Sam's book really getting published?

186
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:04,100
That's what she said.

187
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,352
[laughs]
Wow.

188
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:13,526
It's been over a year since we spoke.

189
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,903
I know.

190
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:18,990
She said to say hi to you.

191
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:23,411
I don't believe that for a second, but...

192
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:26,039
it's very sweet of you to say.

193
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:28,458
Aw, Mom.
[sobs]

194
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,544
Please don't ever hate me the way she hates me.

195
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:33,296
I don't hate you at all, Mom.

196
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:38,426
Good, but you are stoned, though, aren't you.

197
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,512
I thought it would make it easier to eat again.

198
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:44,223
Pot and nothing else, ever, you understand me?

199
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:45,642
You don't have to worry about me, Mom.

200
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:47,185
[whispers]
Yeah, I do.

201
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:48,853
It's my job.

202
00:12:57,153 --> 00:12:59,280
I cleared the table and started the dishes.

203
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:02,533
Sorry I reacted the way I did.

204
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:04,202
I was just surprised.

205
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:05,745
I thought you were happy with the book.

206
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,497
I was.

207
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,917
It just didn't seem like my book anymore.

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,253
It felt like someone else's.

209
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:17,548
My editorial hand a little
heavy for you? Yes, Dad.

210
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:24,097
I was scared of how you'd react,

211
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,101
and I felt guilty because of all the
work you put into Just Saying Hi.

212
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:30,812
I'm sorry...
Stop apologizing.

213
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:37,610
It's my fault for involving myself in
your goddamn book in the first place.

214
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:42,365
[sighs] I'm guessing you don't want to read the new one?

215
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,327
Fuck no.

216
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:49,497
Never?
No, thank you.

217
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,999
I brought you a hard copy.

218
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:52,792
Really?
Yeah.

219
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,503
I was going to sign it for you if you wanted,

220
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:59,048
or not...
but maybe?

221
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:00,550
Leave it on my desk.

222
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:08,725
Wait... can I ask you a question
without you getting defensive?

223
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,397
What?

224
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,858
Rusty told me Martin called the
cops on a prowler the other night.

225
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:22,196
Dad, you've got to stop doing this to yourself.
It's been two years.

226
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,407
She's coming back. You're
completely delusional.

227
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,367
And what's with setting a place for her at the table?

228
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:28,786
That's fucking nuts. You
know they're fighting again?

229
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,996
And where did you see that?

230
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,998
Through their window?

231
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,333
Really? People get arrested
for doing things like that.

232
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,044
You're a well respected novelist.

233
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:38,129
You've won the PEN Faulkner Award twice.

234
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,672
You can't behave like that.

235
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:41,466
She's coming back.

236
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:43,718
Jesus, at least tell me you've been writing.

237
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,972
Look at what you've let her do to you, Dad.

238
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:52,560
Seriously.

239
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:07,200
[knocking]

240
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:11,120
Hey. What are you working on?

241
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:14,207
It's a poem for English class.

242
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,251
Sorry about earlier.
I was being a dick.

243
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:18,878
It's okay.

244
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,505
Yeah, you were right.
I was just jealous.

245
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:22,632
I really am happy for you.
It's awesome.

246
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:25,134
You're going to have a book
published one day, too, you know.

247
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:26,260
Sure, I know.

248
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:30,139
Jason hooked me up with some weed.

249
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:34,143
Roof?

250
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:38,439
Got your eye on any girls this year?

251
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,236
Yeah, there's this girl...

252
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:47,865
Kate, in my English class.

253
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:50,243
Every time I see her, I hear that song,

254
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:53,412
the Beatles' song, "I've Just Seen a
Face," playing in my head. [coughs]

255
00:15:53,496 --> 00:15:55,289
God, you are so pathetic.

256
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:57,041
At least I know I'm pathetic.

257
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,793
Let me give you some advice.

258
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,086
I can't wait to hear your advice.

259
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:02,547
It's so friggin' awesome.

260
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,091
There are two kinds of people in this world.

261
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:09,303
Hopeless romantics and realists.
Right.

262
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:11,806
A realist just sees that face

263
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,059
and packs it in with every other
pretty girl they've ever seen before.

264
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:18,437
The hopeless romantic becomes convinced

265
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:22,233
that God put them on Earth to be with that one person.

266
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,694
But there is no God,

267
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:29,073
and life is only as meaningful as you
fool yourself into thinking it is.

268
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:31,826
Guys who get laid a lot are realists.

269
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,703
You should be listening.

270
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,124
Just avoid love at all costs.

271
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:39,500
That's my motto.

272
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:45,923
Never been in lave?

273
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:49,177
If love is setting a place at the table
for someone who is never coming home,

274
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,761
I think I'll pass.

275
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:54,432
That's fucking depressing, Sam.

276
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,602
Making students read their poetry
assignments in front of the class

277
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:59,812
is a sadistic exercise in public humiliation.

278
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:01,772
You could have already been done with it by now, Rusty.

279
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:03,441
Okay, okay, okay.
Just read it.

280
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,484
[groans]

281
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:10,072
Um, okay, this is a poem I wrote over Thanksgiving break.

282
00:17:10,156 --> 00:17:13,743
Uh...
It's called School.

283
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:16,287
It was written under the influence of cannabis.

284
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,623
[students laugh]

285
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:22,627
Okay, um... In the sea
of... This is so awkward.

286
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,629
Uh...
[groans]

287
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:27,465
"In the sea of desks, there's talk of games and bags

288
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:32,345
"and long pipes that leak dreams
with the strike of a match.

289
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:34,555
"And there's a loudness to the whispers I hear.

290
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:37,850
"Whispers shouldn't be that loud, should they?

291
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,977
"There's a girl over there who everyone knows

292
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:44,190
"and men without ears who will
stand by the door for a price.

293
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:47,568
"In long hallways, there are
angry mobs of dwarves and rats

294
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:49,278
"and one single angel."

295
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,538
Hey, Rusty. Hi.

296
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:04,168
Hi. Hi, I, um... I
liked your poem.

297
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:07,838
Yeah?
Yeah, it was really good.

298
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:11,384
Thanks.
Sure.

299
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:13,803
How was your Thanksgiving?

300
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,514
Oh, it was good.
It was a little weird.

301
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,850
My parents are divorced, sol have two Thanksgivings

302
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,519
in one Thanksgiving.

303
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:23,354
It's just, like, strange.
[giggles]

304
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,064
How about you?

305
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,316
It was just boring. Whatever.
That's cool.

306
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,485
[whispers]
Yeah.

307
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:32,530
Kate.

308
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,490
I have to go.

309
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:38,828
I just wanted to say I liked your poem, so...

310
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,955
Bye.
All right.

311
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:44,834
Who the fuck is that?

312
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,460
Just a guy from class.

313
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:50,923
Fucking asshole.

314
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:04,395
Hi.

315
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:07,940
I literally have 20 minutes, so it will have to be quick.

316
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:09,400
Come on.
Let's go.

317
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,443
Did you stretch?

318
00:19:15,323 --> 00:19:16,824
Come on.

319
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,203
Just a second.

320
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:23,039
Oh, yeah.

321
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:24,915
Oh, make it rain.

322
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:27,168
Yeah.
[gasps]

323
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,173
Yeah.
To the left.

324
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,091
To the...
yeah.

325
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:39,513
Yes!

326
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:51,442
All right, I got to run.

327
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,652
Thursday, be ready.

328
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:55,696
Yes, Sarah.

329
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,865
[door closes]

330
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:04,372
[loud rock music in ear buds]

331
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:07,083
Hey!

332
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,001
Hey!
Goddamn it!

333
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:10,669
What are you doing?

334
00:20:10,753 --> 00:20:12,004
You scared me.
I caught you.

335
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:13,756
You're reading my journal.

336
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,591
You promised you'd never read our journals.

337
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,259
Sorry. I trusted you, Dad.

338
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:19,011
I'm sorry. That pisses
me off so much.

339
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,013
I'm sorry. It's an
invasion of privacy.

340
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:23,224
Rusty, I--I--I-- Sit down for a second.
Let me explain.

341
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,934
No, I'm not going to sit down.

342
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:26,936
Okay, okay. I wasn't
reading your journal.

343
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,896
I--I flipped it open to check
the dates like I always do

344
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,315
and something jumped out at me

345
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:33,859
and--and--and grabbed me.
I'm sorry, okay?

346
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:35,736
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,322
What?

348
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:39,407
May I?

349
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:50,709
"I remember that it hurt.

350
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:52,378
"Looking at her hurt."

351
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:55,464
That's it.

352
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:59,301
If that was the opening line of a
book, you'd have your reader hooked.

353
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:01,846
They would have to keep reading.
I had to keep reading. Sorry.

354
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,889
Flattery is not going to get you out of this.

355
00:21:03,973 --> 00:21:05,850
No, no, that's coming to an end right now.

356
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:08,227
You know Flannery O'Connor?
I know Flannery O'Connor.

357
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,855
She said nothing needed to happen in
a writer's life after they were 20.

358
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:13,107
By then, they had experienced more than enough

359
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,734
to last
their creative life. So?

360
00:21:15,818 --> 00:21:16,944
So what's your point?

361
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,029
My point is...

362
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:21,282
Sit down for a second, please.

363
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,745
Rusty...
[sighs]

364
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:29,707
I don't think you're experiencing enough.

365
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,878
I mean, the reason that you're comfortable
leaving your goddamn journal on my desk

366
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,922
is because there's nothing you're
trying to hide from me in your life.

367
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:40,176
And that really worries me, you know?

368
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:43,387
Sweet, sensitive guys like you, they
spend their entire high school years

369
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,473
frozen in place while...

370
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:47,349
everybody is running around going to parties

371
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:50,352
and getting laid, doing whatever.

372
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:52,104
I don't want you to look back years from now

373
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:55,316
and think about this girl.
Is it Kate? Yeah.

374
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,901
Tell this girl how you feel.

375
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,528
Put your heart on the line.

376
00:21:59,612 --> 00:22:01,363
It's not that easy.

377
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:03,365
It is, too. It is, too.
Look at your sister.

378
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:05,034
You can...
Hey!

379
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:06,494
You can roll your eyes all you want.

380
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:08,370
Your sister is a great writer.

381
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:10,372
And it's because she's courageous in her life.

382
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:12,708
She's promiscuous, Dad.
It's not the same thing.

383
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:16,003
Rusty, a writer is the sum of their experiences.

384
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:19,298
Go get some.

385
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,258
It will be fun.

386
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:23,177
Come on. This is crazy. What
are we doing here, man?

387
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,803
Everyone hates us.

388
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:26,430
Not tonight, they don't.
Not tonight.

389
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:32,436
What?

390
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,979
Uh, we're here for the party.

391
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:37,191
What party?

392
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:39,235
Dude, come on man. I'm, like,
in three classes with you.

393
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:42,196
Fuck off.

394
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,657
Okay, but...

395
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,369
what are going to do with all this weed?

396
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:49,745
I was just playing, man.
Come on.

397
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,413
Really? Yeah. Come on in.

398
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:02,132
Hey! Hey, my boys...

399
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:03,384
Wait.
What's your name?

400
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,844
Rusty.
This is Jason.

401
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:09,139
Hey, my boys Rusty and Jason just
brought us a shitload of weed.

402
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:11,058
Your name is Rodney, right?

403
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,102
Hey, man, Rodney.
What's up?

404
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:15,354
You make sure with Jason that everybody gets some, okay?

405
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:16,939
Where you going?

406
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,524
I'm going to go find my friend, Kate.

407
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,901
Which chick?
Oh, they still upstairs!

408
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,864
Dude, who are you?

409
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:28,117
I'm a new and improved Rusty Borgens.

410
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:33,261
[singing pop song]

411
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:18,042
[phone ringing]

412
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,586
[recording] This is Sam. Leave
me a message after the beep.

413
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:23,088
[sighs, beep]

414
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,531
[snores]
[sighs]

415
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,987
[woman knocking]
Come on, Glen.

416
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:48,739
Glen, open the door.

417
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:51,158
I've been waiting for ten minutes.
Come on.

418
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,118
Could I have a fucking second please?

419
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:55,245
No, I can't give you a fucking second.
I'm in pain.

420
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:17,101
Shut the fucking door!

421
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,156
Let's go, Jason. Let's
get out of here.

422
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,033
Dude, I'm not going anywhere.
Let's go.

423
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:35,077
I'm not going anywhere.
That plan was genius, dude.

424
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,787
It was a joke.
It wasn't a fucking joke.

425
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,207
It's not funny.
Get the fuck off me.

426
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,667
Hey, don't walk away from me.

427
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,043
Stop.
You're crazy.

428
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:44,962
Quit following me, Glen.

429
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,089
This is my house. I can go
wherever the fuck I want.

430
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,341
All right, big shot. Listen, I'm
leaving, all right, asshole?

431
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:50,692
Get the fuck out of here.
[crowd gasps]

432
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,344
Hey, asshole.

433
00:25:52,428 --> 00:25:54,096
[crowd yells]

434
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:01,937
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

435
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,605
Okay, come on.

436
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,607
Let me grab that.

437
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:10,362
Run, run!

438
00:26:10,446 --> 00:26:11,739
I'm going to fucking kill you.

439
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,617
Dude, dude, fuck yeah, man!

440
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:21,540
All right.
Later, man.

441
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,208
See you, buddy.
Later.

442
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:28,964
Hey, asshole!
Boom!

443
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:35,929
I can't go home like this.

444
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:41,518
I'm a wreck. My knees are
all banged up and I'm high.

445
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:46,565
Yeah, we should probably get some ice on those.

446
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,942
Can I stay at your house tonight?

447
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,613
Okay.

448
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:59,787
[eerie cell phone ring]

449
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,374
Hello?

450
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,836
[Erica]
Hi. Hi, it's me.

451
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,589
Hey, you okay?

452
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,801
Um, where are you?

453
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,721
I'm here.
I'm at home.

454
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:20,140
Oh, I've been ringing the bell.

455
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,851
I fell asleep.
Are you here?

456
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:31,026
All right, we need to put our heads together.

457
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,695
Okay.
Bill, I can't sleep.

458
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,949
Okay, I'm driving around in my
pajamas in the middle of the night.

459
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:39,910
I'm like a crazy person. I
can't live like this anymore.

460
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:41,787
I can't either.

461
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,039
I've given her space.

462
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,708
I accept her hatred towards me as
some phase she's going through,

463
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,627
but this isn't a phase.

464
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,838
She has this amazing thing going on with her life now

465
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:53,090
with this book being published,
and I can't share that with her.

466
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,508
She won't return my calls.

467
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,051
She won't return my emails.

468
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,803
She's-she's having
a book published.

469
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:59,680
She's busy.
Bullshit.

470
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:01,515
I can't get her to return my calls.
Bullshit.

471
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:04,017
She's petty and she's cruel.

472
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:05,519
Everyone's parents are divorced.

473
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:06,937
Big fucking deal.
You get over it.

474
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,063
She fights with me, too.

475
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:09,898
We're not fighting.

476
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:11,984
That's the thing. I wish
I could fight with her.

477
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,944
Then I'd be an active participant in her life.

478
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,113
She just abandoned me.

479
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,448
No, I don't think... She's abandoned you?
That seems horrible.

480
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:21,451
You are in a constant state of denial about everything.

481
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:23,912
Bill, she acts like I don't exist.

482
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,956
I haven't spoken to her in over a year

483
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,916
and you're not helping things.

484
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,751
Me? I haven't said one thing.
I--I-- What did I--

485
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,796
You set a place for me
at Thanksgiving. Yeah.

486
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,506
So everytime she comes home from school,

487
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,592
she sees you miserable and moping

488
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,594
and she blames me.
I know she blames me.

489
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:39,761
I know she does.
I don't mope.

490
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:41,471
Oh, you mope.

491
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:42,890
You mope.

492
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,641
Say horrible things about me,

493
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:46,602
but don't try to win her sympathy this way.

494
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:49,187
Hey, I made a promise to you and I intend to keep it.

495
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:52,691
Oh, Jesus.
Bill...

496
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:56,737
That was a lifetime ago.

497
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,281
I release you from your promise.

498
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:03,201
Please... go on
with your life.

499
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:04,620
Go get laid.
I get laid.

500
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,414
Great! You get laid? Mm-hmm.

501
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:09,625
Well, then, be happy.

502
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:10,834
I just want you to be happy.

503
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:12,336
I was happy with you.

504
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,046
You were the one who wasn't happy.

505
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:17,215
Well, I'm happy now.

506
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,509
You don't look happy to me.

507
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:23,680
When? When you're sneaking
around our house at night?

508
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:29,645
I see you and Martin fighting.

509
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,271
Shut up, Bill.

510
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:44,534
Oh, hey.
Wait a minute.

511
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:45,869
Excuse me.

512
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:49,164
You know I--

513
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:50,749
I don't mean to be presumptuous,

514
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:53,794
but I wouldn't do that if I were you.

515
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:56,129
I mean, he sleeps with a lot of girls.

516
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,715
You're practically guaranteed to wake up with a rash.

517
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,342
Thanks for the tip.

518
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,010
I see you you getting snared in his web.

519
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:04,054
You look like a nice girl and all, so.

520
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:05,722
I'm not a nice girl.

521
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:07,849
Well, in that case, I'm Louis.

522
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,644
Everyone calls me Lou.
Nice to meet you.

523
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,354
No? Okay.

524
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,439
Look, I don't want to hurt your feelings,

525
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:15,941
but you're wasting your time.

526
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,776
What, talking is a waste of time?

527
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,486
We're not talking.

528
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,113
You're flirting with me.

529
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:23,323
And you're also cockblocking your friend.

530
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:25,617
Huh?
Bon Jovi over there?

531
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,536
He's not my friend.
He's a dick, actually.

532
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,788
I'm just filling in on bass for them tonight.

533
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,999
You're cute, Lou.

534
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:34,710
But you reek of romance and good intentions.

535
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:36,336
I'm not looking for a nice guy.

536
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,046
I don't do boyfriends, and I don't date.

537
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,966
All I heard was don't, don't, don't, don't.

538
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:43,051
Well, don’t keep people safe.

539
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,553
I'm going to go.

540
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:47,305
Okay, well, I'll see you in class.

541
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,016
Do we have a class together?

542
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,435
Advanced Fiction Writing.

543
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,062
I don't remember you.
Well, I remember you.

544
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:57,566
You have a book that's getting published.
Your dad must be thrilled.

545
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,484
You know an awful lot about me, Lou.

546
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:02,404
We writers are an envious bunch, so...

547
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:03,739
What's his name?

548
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:08,744
His name is Pete.

549
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:11,288
Have fun.
I will.

550
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,208
Cool. You're awesome.

551
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,217
I didn't know you lived at the beach.
Shh-shh.

552
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:25,802
[whispers]
Keep your voice down.

553
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:27,679
I just don't want to wake my dad up.

554
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:30,807
I'm going to go get some ice for that.

555
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:37,856
There you go.
Thank you.

556
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,819
Sure.

557
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:44,321
Rusty?

558
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:46,990
Hey, Dad, what are you doing up?

559
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:48,784
Who's this?

560
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:52,454
Uh, Dad, this is Kate.
Kate, this is Dad.

561
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:54,289
Hi.

562
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:57,042
Hi.

563
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,543
What happened to your knees?

564
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:01,213
She fell. This
asshole pushed me.

565
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:03,632
Really?
Somebody pushed you?

566
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:07,177
Yeah, but it's okay, because Rusty punched him.

567
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,347
Oh, good. Nobody should ever push
a girl and get away with it.

568
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,807
That's a good start, that ice.

569
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,559
We have some peroxide in here.

570
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:16,520
So you are Kate.

571
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:18,230
Rusty's fold me a lot about you.

572
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:21,399
He has? Um...

573
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,276
We hardly know each other.

574
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,028
I just know he thinks very highly of you.

575
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:28,240
Dad?
Sorry, sorry.

576
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:29,699
Are you staying the night?

577
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:33,078
Uh, yeah, if that's okay.

578
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:36,081
Okay. Your parents
don't mind?

579
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:38,125
No.

580
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:42,087
All right. You take the bed
and she takes the couch...

581
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,715
Or the other way. You take the
couch and she takes the bed.

582
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,051
Whichever one.

583
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:49,344
Nice meeting you, Kate.

584
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:53,974
You, too.
Goodnight.

585
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:55,350
Sorry.

586
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:58,728
Your dad's nice.

587
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,522
Yeah, he's a good guy.

588
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:03,775
What does he do?

589
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:07,070
Uh... he's a writer.

590
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,864
Like a real one?

591
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:10,907
Yeah, he wrote a book called Suit Monkeys.

592
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:13,910
Won some awards, had a bunch
of books published. Thanks.

593
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:17,080
Whoa, uh...

594
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:19,666
I didn't know you were going
to... I'll turn around.

595
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:22,502
Well, that's cool.

596
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,546
Is that what you want to do?

597
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:26,840
Uh, yeah.
I'm a writer, too.

598
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:28,717
So is my sister.

599
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,678
We write books and stories and stuff.

600
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,889
Poetry?

601
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:35,765
Yeah.

602
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:37,267
Where's your sister?

603
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,061
She's, you know, away at college.

604
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:44,107
Yeah, so I--

605
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:48,570
Wait, can you stay with me a second?

606
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,113
Please?

607
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:52,365
Yeah, sure.

608
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:02,918
You can come closer.
I don't bite.

609
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:13,553
I have a question.

610
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:15,263
Yeah...

611
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:21,269
Was I the angel in the poem you wrote?

612
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,273
Yeah.

613
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:48,922
I think you're going to be very good for me.

614
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:53,134
Goodnight.

615
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:08,400
[professor speaking in distance]

616
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,395
I love Christmas.

617
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,898
You strike me as one of those people.

618
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:52,569
I am. I'm definitely
one of those people.

619
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,738
I love everything about it.

620
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:58,033
I love the lights, the decorations,

621
00:35:58,116 --> 00:36:04,456
how TBS plays A Christmas Story 24 hours straight.

622
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:06,416
Presents under the tree

623
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:09,252
and the looks on my kids' faces when they open them.

624
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:13,381
Sitting by the fire with my husband when they go to bed.

625
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:16,760
I get all depressed during the holidays.

626
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:20,680
Yeah, well, you're divorced, Bill.
It's depressing.

627
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:25,602
Hey, can I give you a little bit of advice?

628
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:29,731
Just from one fuckbuddy to another.

629
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:31,441
Mm-hmm.

630
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,443
You need to remarry.

631
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:34,944
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.

632
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:37,447
You're not getting any younger.

633
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,701
And if I were you, I'd be on every dating website

634
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:45,413
signing up and just combing the
newspapers for personal ads.

635
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:47,290
I haven't been on a date in 25 years.

636
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:49,000
Yeah, but what is that?

637
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,002
Listen, you're handsome, you're successful.

638
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:52,879
You have a mild amount of celebrity,

639
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:55,799
which is really all a writer can ask for.

640
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:57,842
That's enough to land one of those

641
00:36:57,926 --> 00:37:00,470
20-something
trophy wives.

642
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,972
You've really thought about this, huh?

643
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:05,266
Well, I care about you, Bill.

644
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:08,812
I know you love Erica,

645
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:10,647
but she married someone else,

646
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,899
and you have to start thinking about your future

647
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:16,736
and whether or not you want that to be a happy one.

648
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,114
Because I don't want to jog by in five years

649
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:21,658
and find you waiting on that lawn chair for me.

650
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:23,785
It's a very comfortable lawn chair.

651
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:25,078
Is it?

652
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:26,913
Just think about it.

653
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:41,845
Procreation. You give to the
next one down the line.

654
00:37:41,928 --> 00:37:43,430
That's really all we've got.

655
00:37:43,513 --> 00:37:45,807
Society, government, money, religion,

656
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,393
careers, nuclear families, monogamy.

657
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:51,729
These are all just highly creative
socially accepted delusions

658
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:56,234
that we impose on reality to try and gain
some semblance of control over our lives.

659
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:58,236
It gives us the illusion of choice.

660
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:01,948
It makes us feel a little less like animals.

661
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:04,409
Animals. What do you mean?
Like evolution?

662
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:06,411
Yeah, evolution, exactly.

663
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:08,246
I do not believe in evolution.

664
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:11,082
There's 400 billion stars in the Milky Way alone,

665
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,084
making the amount of stars in the entire universe

666
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,503
completely mindboggling.

667
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:17,380
We are nothing.

668
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,507
If an asteroid hadn't hit Earth 65 million years ago

669
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:20,884
and wiped out all the dinosaurs,

670
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:22,886
we wouldn't be here.

671
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:25,555
Yeah.
I'm going to go.

672
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:31,102
Good. All you creationists do is
blow chances at getting laid.

673
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:34,814
Really.
Ooh, that was awkward.

674
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:36,983
You've really got to stop stalking me.

675
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,903
I can't even go anywhere without
you showing up to annoy me.

676
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:42,530
Were you hitting on that guy?
It's none of your business.

677
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,073
I think he's a Mormon.

678
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:45,742
Well, what the hell is he doing here?

679
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:47,827
Trying to find other Mormon girls.

680
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:51,623
I'm sure you corrupted him,
ruined his relationship with God.

681
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:53,124
You want to get out of here?

682
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,376
Do you have brain damage?

683
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,420
No. I think I made
it pretty clear

684
00:38:57,504 --> 00:38:59,589
that I have absolutely no interest in going out with you.

685
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:01,841
No, no, no. You and I
are going to be friends.

686
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:03,676
But I don't want to be friends with you.

687
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,179
[whispers]
Oh, you don't want to be.

688
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,306
Well, I'm going to take your jacket

689
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,517
and you can follow me. We can
get some coffee if you'd like.

690
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,770
I need that...

691
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,313
jacket

692
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:19,275
What are some of your favorite books?

693
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,861
Is that really the angle you're going to play?

694
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:25,573
Really? I thought you'd be
more creative than this.

695
00:39:25,698 --> 00:39:29,410
Well, come on, we're writers, right?
Yeah.

696
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:32,205
Books matter to us. I mean,
come on here, please.

697
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:35,708
Fine, what are some of your favorite books?

698
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:37,669
No, you can't do that.
I asked you.

699
00:39:37,752 --> 00:39:39,754
Because you want to know something personal about me.

700
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:42,048
If I tell you what my favorite books are,

701
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:44,342
you'll say titles that will
convince me that we're soulmates,

702
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,344
or you'll latch onto one of my favorites

703
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:48,263
and try to convince me it's one of your favorites, too.

704
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:49,722
God, you're so tough.

705
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:51,099
It's why you're obsessed with me.

706
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:52,433
I'm not obsessed with you.

707
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:54,060
I'm like a unicorn to you.

708
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:55,895
You'll do or say anything to possess me.

709
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,189
I'm not like that and you're not like a unicorn.

710
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:00,149
Okay, well, then books.

711
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:02,360
But please, at least attempt to be interesting.

712
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:04,862
No Catcher in the Rye or Portnoy's Complaint, okay?

713
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:09,200
Well, I write mysteries, so...

714
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:12,203
I love Elmore Leonard, James Lee Burke,

715
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:13,871
Ed Brubaker.

716
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:16,332
Who's Ed Brubaker.

717
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:20,211
He writes an incredible, hard-boiled
crime comic called Criminal.

718
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:22,505
Telling me that you read comic books

719
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:25,174
isn't exactly sweeping me off my feet.

720
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:27,218
What's your favorite book?

721
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:28,969
Just say the first thing that pops into your head.

722
00:40:30,388 --> 00:40:32,432
Dear Mr. Henshaw
by Beverly Cleary.

723
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:36,311
Been my favorite since I was a kid.

724
00:40:36,394 --> 00:40:38,146
Read it, like, 100 times.

725
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:41,107
It's actually what made me want to be a writer.

726
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:43,359
Hey, is something wrong?

727
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:45,361
I have to go.

728
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,196
Well, what... what do you mean?
Did I do something?

729
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,698
I have to go.

730
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:49,824
Samantha.

731
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:54,412
Samantha, wait. Come on. What?

732
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:56,122
What do you want from me?

733
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:57,665
What do you mean what do I want from you?

734
00:40:57,749 --> 00:40:59,208
I like you.

735
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:00,960
I want to get to know you better.
No.

736
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:02,920
Why do you keep running away?
Because this...

737
00:41:03,004 --> 00:41:04,964
whatever this is between us, it can't go any further.

738
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:07,759
I won't let it. We're not
even in the same species.

739
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:10,553
Is Dear Mr. Henshaw
your favorite book, too?

740
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:12,221
I don't do this, Lou.

741
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:13,723
No.
No, of course not.

742
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:15,558
You just give yourself away

743
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:17,810
to assholes with infinitely lower IQs than yours.

744
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:25,401
Fuck.

745
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:28,696
[knocking]

746
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,115
Hi.
Hi.

747
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:34,452
Is your dad here?

748
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:35,953
Uh, no...

749
00:41:36,037 --> 00:41:38,581
Well, when is he going to be back?

750
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:42,126
I don't know. Maybe
a couple of hours.

751
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,795
Why?

752
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:47,674
I want to give you your Christmas present.

753
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,929
Um, okay.

754
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:04,649
Merry Christmas.

755
00:42:04,732 --> 00:42:07,110
Oh...
awesome.

756
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:09,362
Come with me.

757
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:10,780
Where are we going?

758
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:12,448
To the closet.

759
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:15,034
Wait, why the closet?
Why not on the bed?

760
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:17,328
Can we open it?
[laughs]

761
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:22,542
Because you've never had sex,

762
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:27,505
and I've never had sex in a closet.

763
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:32,051
You'll remember me and you'll remember this moment

764
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:35,054
and that makes me very, very happy.

765
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:47,900
[Rusty and Kate laughing]

766
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:24,228
Oh, fuck.

767
00:43:31,736 --> 00:43:33,279
Hi.

768
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:37,617
How's she feeling?

769
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,203
She's okay. You
should go see her.

770
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:00,348
How you feeling?

771
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:04,477
Not too bad.

772
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,062
Don't bullshit me.

773
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:08,147
I'm like a no bullshit detector here.

774
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:11,025
I'm fine.

775
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:13,736
Shut up and read to me. Okay.

776
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:28,835
"Dalie Hallie couldn't tell if she felt huge or small.

777
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:31,337
"She wondered whether her head

778
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,882
"were so big as to be able to
contain all this starry universe...

779
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:37,552
"or if the universe were so little that it would fit

780
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:40,179
"within the compass
of her human head."

781
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:42,890
Lou?

782
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:45,601
Do you see that angel by the door

783
00:44:45,685 --> 00:44:47,854
or am I the only one seeing her?

784
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:58,072
Oh, that... that's definitely
not an angel, Mom.

785
00:45:04,245 --> 00:45:06,706
Hi.
Hi.

786
00:45:06,831 --> 00:45:09,208
Hi. What are you doing here?

787
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:11,919
Oh, same thing you're doing, I hope.

788
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:13,504
Don't be suspicious.

789
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:16,340
I'm getting a laptop for Samantha.

790
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:19,302
In fact, I got to pick out a color.
Why don't you come?

791
00:45:19,385 --> 00:45:21,137
I don't know.
Excuse me.

792
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,556
Huh?
What don't you know?

793
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:26,601
I don't know if it's a good idea, Bill.

794
00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:29,478
It will take ten minutes.

795
00:45:29,562 --> 00:45:30,813
I'd love to.
Yeah.

796
00:45:30,897 --> 00:45:33,232
Yeah?
Yeah, I'd love to.

797
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:35,860
I'm glad I bumped into you.

798
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:38,362
I'm sure that's what all stalkers say.

799
00:45:38,446 --> 00:45:41,824
No, really.

800
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:44,118
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.

801
00:45:44,243 --> 00:45:46,245
Really?
Mm-hmm.

802
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:48,539
Somebody else said the same thing recently.

803
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:51,667
Someone else asked you to stop
hanging around their house at night?

804
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:55,338
About moving on with my life.

805
00:45:57,381 --> 00:45:59,300
Who was that?

806
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:01,093
Tricia Wolcott.

807
00:46:01,177 --> 00:46:02,887
Lives about a mile and a half down the beach.

808
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:04,805
Yeah, I remember her.
Yeah.

809
00:46:04,889 --> 00:46:07,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

810
00:46:07,934 --> 00:46:10,770
I always suspected you had a crush on her.

811
00:46:10,853 --> 00:46:12,647
Yeah, she's very pretty.

812
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:15,441
She's very married, as I recall.

813
00:46:17,693 --> 00:46:19,403
You're seeing her?

814
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:21,238
I think I'm a good way for her to kill an hour

815
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:23,115
after she drops her kids off at school.

816
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:25,660
An hour?

817
00:46:25,743 --> 00:46:27,662
An hour.

818
00:46:27,745 --> 00:46:31,874
So she thinks you need to stop moping around, too, huh?

819
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:34,502
Something like that.

820
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:36,253
Here's a confession.

821
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:39,840
I'm not a great writer.

822
00:46:41,592 --> 00:46:44,095
I'm a great
re-writer.

823
00:46:44,178 --> 00:46:46,222
I think about us.

824
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:48,933
Our story and...

825
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:51,102
and all the things that went wrong with us

826
00:46:51,185 --> 00:46:54,146
and I-- I could do it so
much better this time.

827
00:46:58,401 --> 00:47:00,611
I haven't written anything since you left.

828
00:47:00,695 --> 00:47:02,613
Bill...

829
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:04,699
you've had two books published.

830
00:47:04,782 --> 00:47:07,702
Well, they were books that I
started when we were married.

831
00:47:07,785 --> 00:47:09,662
I finished them, but I haven't written anything new.

832
00:47:09,745 --> 00:47:11,914
You are a great writer.

833
00:47:11,998 --> 00:47:15,167
Don't waste all your imagination on me.

834
00:47:21,382 --> 00:47:22,425
Which way are you...

835
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:24,427
I'm over here.

836
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,512
I'm the other way.

837
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:29,348
It was great running into you.

838
00:47:29,432 --> 00:47:32,018
You, too.

839
00:47:32,101 --> 00:47:33,811
Bill...

840
00:47:37,523 --> 00:47:42,903
I have... I have days when I'm not
sure if I made the right decision.

841
00:47:42,987 --> 00:47:45,197
I have bad days, too.

842
00:47:48,534 --> 00:47:50,870
I don't know why I'm saying this.

843
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:53,956
I guess I just don't want you to
think that I don't think about us,

844
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,625
you know, and...

845
00:47:56,709 --> 00:47:58,085
all those years we spent together,

846
00:47:58,169 --> 00:47:59,170
because I do...

847
00:47:59,253 --> 00:48:01,547
think about...

848
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,591
everything that I gave up.

849
00:48:06,302 --> 00:48:08,345
I wonder if it was worth it.

850
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:11,724
Was it?

851
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:20,232
I got to go.
[sighs]

852
00:48:20,316 --> 00:48:21,776
Merry Christmas.

853
00:48:24,737 --> 00:48:26,447
Merry Christmas.

854
00:48:29,283 --> 00:48:31,577
It was so nice to meet you.

855
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,996
Oh, you, too, Samantha.

856
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,499
I hope you come back and see me again soon.

857
00:48:36,582 --> 00:48:38,167
I will.
Okay, you two.

858
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,585
I'm going to walk Sam to her car.

859
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:41,670
I'll be right back, Mom.

860
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:43,839
[caretaker] Not so fast.
I made hot chocolate.

861
00:48:43,923 --> 00:48:45,049
It's in the kitchen.

862
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:49,512
What's wrong with your mom?

863
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:55,726
She, um...
She has a brain tumor.

864
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,604
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

865
00:49:02,608 --> 00:49:04,944
I can't believe how much of a bitch I've been to you.

866
00:49:05,027 --> 00:49:06,946
Yeah, I know, right?

867
00:49:07,029 --> 00:49:09,657
Okay, yeah.

868
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:14,578
I don't... I don't want you
to feel sorry for me.

869
00:49:14,662 --> 00:49:18,082
Really, I--

870
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:21,377
I've enjoyed all of our back
and forth, you know, sparring.

871
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,296
It's really... it's helped me
take my mind off of all this.

872
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:28,134
Well, I'm glad I could help out.

873
00:49:29,802 --> 00:49:31,512
You going home for Christmas?

874
00:49:31,595 --> 00:49:33,973
Yeah, I'm headed back there tomorrow.

875
00:49:36,142 --> 00:49:41,522
Well, I'm willing to forget about
this whole stalking incident,

876
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:44,066
if you will allow me to take you out

877
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,026
on a proper date when you get back.

878
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:47,319
Okay.

879
00:49:49,071 --> 00:49:50,406
Really?
That easy? Yeah?

880
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:52,783
I'm not going to say it again.

881
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:54,451
Okay.

882
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:57,538
Oh, I actually...

883
00:49:57,621 --> 00:50:02,585
brought you an ARC of my new book.

884
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,297
Oh, wow. Stalking and a present.

885
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:11,635
Under the Pink by Samantha Borgens.
Look at that.

886
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:18,350
Well, I will... I will
read this over break.

887
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:20,394
Probably aloud.

888
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:23,022
My mom and I have been tearing through some books lately.

889
00:50:23,105 --> 00:50:25,232
No, you can't read it to her.

890
00:50:25,316 --> 00:50:27,651
It's filled with sex and profanity.

891
00:50:27,735 --> 00:50:29,862
Oh, no, she loves sex.

892
00:50:32,489 --> 00:50:34,617
(Samantha)
You added too much water.

893
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,244
(Bill)
It's not like you're Martha Stewart in here.

894
00:50:37,328 --> 00:50:41,665
Says the guy who puts sprinkles on burn.

895
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:43,500
Hey, guys.

896
00:50:43,584 --> 00:50:44,835
Look at you!

897
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:46,253
Why are you all dressed up?

898
00:50:46,337 --> 00:50:47,838
I'm going over to Kate's.

899
00:50:47,922 --> 00:50:49,506
Why does it smell so horrible in here?

900
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,550
No, no, no. These are our cookies.
Smell.

901
00:50:51,634 --> 00:50:53,427
Yeah, we burned the first batch.

902
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,304
Actually, this is the second.
[fire alarm beeps]

903
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:57,473
No, no, no, no, no!

904
00:50:57,556 --> 00:51:00,434
Sorry!

905
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,519
Oh, my God, Dad!
What?

906
00:51:02,603 --> 00:51:04,063
This is ridiculous!

907
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:05,689
We burned them again!

908
00:51:05,773 --> 00:51:06,941
Oh, God. Okay...
[laughing]

909
00:51:07,024 --> 00:51:09,235
Yeah, no laughing, Rusty.

910
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:11,362
When am I going to meet this girl?

911
00:51:11,445 --> 00:51:13,322
I don't know. Try not
to burn the house down.

912
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:14,365
Yeah, drive careful.

913
00:51:14,448 --> 00:51:15,616
I will.

914
00:51:17,493 --> 00:51:19,495
How serious is this thing?

915
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:21,664
Uh, they're having sex.

916
00:51:21,747 --> 00:51:24,833
What?
How do you know?

917
00:51:24,959 --> 00:51:28,420
Yeah.
Wow, go Rusty!

918
00:51:28,504 --> 00:51:30,130
She has more experience than him.

919
00:51:30,214 --> 00:51:32,132
Yeah, well, who doesn't?

920
00:51:32,216 --> 00:51:34,426
He seems really happy.

921
00:51:35,928 --> 00:51:37,596
At least someone in this house is.

922
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,474
Do you see a frown on my face?

923
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:43,519
You do seem unusually chipper today.

924
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:45,354
Have you discovered
anti-depressants?

925
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:49,650
Actually, no. I'm just
moving on with my life.

926
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:51,360
I'm done with the whole thing with your mom,

927
00:51:51,443 --> 00:51:53,320
and I'm moving forward.

928
00:51:53,404 --> 00:51:56,031
Seriously?

929
00:51:56,115 --> 00:51:57,950
New Year's resolution.

930
00:51:58,033 --> 00:51:59,868
How about that?
Moving on.

931
00:51:59,952 --> 00:52:01,537
Dad?
Yeah.

932
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,871
That's huge!

933
00:52:02,955 --> 00:52:05,040
That's so...
Oh, flour hug.

934
00:52:05,124 --> 00:52:08,335
No, no, no!

935
00:52:08,419 --> 00:52:09,670
Not on my white shirt.

936
00:52:09,753 --> 00:52:11,547
Ta-da!

937
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,549
I thought you already gave me my Christmas present.

938
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:15,718
Shut up and open it.
Come on.

939
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:18,012
All right, here we go.

940
00:52:20,139 --> 00:52:21,557
This isn't just a CD.

941
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,058
It isn't?
No.

942
00:52:23,142 --> 00:52:26,020
It's a roadmap to my soul.

943
00:52:27,688 --> 00:52:29,356
It's like if you gave me a favorite book.

944
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,318
Yeah, speaking of that.

945
00:52:32,401 --> 00:52:33,652
Boom.

946
00:52:33,736 --> 00:52:35,404
Oh, my gosh.

947
00:52:39,241 --> 00:52:42,828
Wow, this is the biggest book I've ever seen.

948
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:44,371
I know it looks formidable,

949
00:52:44,455 --> 00:52:46,457
but honestly, it's going to be, like,

950
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,043
one of the most satisfying reading
experiences of your life.

951
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:50,794
Is it scary?

952
00:52:50,878 --> 00:52:52,755
Yeah, sure, but it's not just a scary book.

953
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:54,506
It's like Moby Dick.
It's about everything.

954
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:56,508
You're going to be so wrapped up in it,

955
00:52:56,592 --> 00:52:58,761
you're going to be crying at
the end of it. You cried.

956
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:00,346
Oh, you'll cry, too, okay?

957
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:01,847
I might have cried.

958
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,895
You're really cute when you get worked up about books.

959
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:15,736
Do I have you worked up about me?

960
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:18,072
Yeah.
Good.

961
00:53:18,155 --> 00:53:21,283
Because I've got to have you right now.

962
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:23,160
What about your parents?
Won't they come in?

963
00:53:23,243 --> 00:53:25,621
They don't come in here.

964
00:53:25,746 --> 00:53:28,040
Are you sure? I'm sure.
Come here.

965
00:53:32,378 --> 00:53:33,796
(Lou)
How was your Christmas?

966
00:53:33,879 --> 00:53:35,464
It was good.

967
00:53:35,547 --> 00:53:38,133
Filled with family. You know, loud.
Yeah.

968
00:53:41,053 --> 00:53:44,181
So you haven't mentioned my book.

969
00:53:44,264 --> 00:53:47,267
Mm. Yeah, um...

970
00:53:47,351 --> 00:53:48,519
So you didn't like it?

971
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:50,020
No, no, that's not it.

972
00:53:50,104 --> 00:53:51,355
I liked it a lot.

973
00:53:51,438 --> 00:53:53,732
It's incredibly well written.

974
00:53:53,816 --> 00:53:57,653
The characters are vibrant and alive.

975
00:53:57,736 --> 00:53:59,154
But?

976
00:53:59,238 --> 00:54:01,198
I mean, I knew you were cynical,

977
00:54:01,281 --> 00:54:06,370
but is that really how you feel about love and marriage?

978
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:09,915
I don't know.
Sometimes.

979
00:54:09,998 --> 00:54:12,209
Oh, thank you.

980
00:54:16,463 --> 00:54:18,090
How much of that really happened?

981
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:20,968
I made most of it up.

982
00:54:21,051 --> 00:54:23,011
I didn't draw that much from my parents' divorce,

983
00:54:23,095 --> 00:54:24,888
other than the little girl seeing her mother

984
00:54:24,972 --> 00:54:27,141
having sex with the man on the beach.

985
00:54:27,266 --> 00:54:30,519
Holy shit, that really happened?
Yeah.

986
00:54:30,602 --> 00:54:33,981
I mean, I wasn't a little girl.
I was in high school.

987
00:54:34,064 --> 00:54:37,693
My parents were having a party, and I was up on the roof.

988
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:39,736
It was late, and my mom

989
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,990
came staggering out of the back of the house with Martin.

990
00:54:43,073 --> 00:54:45,742
And she was all over him.

991
00:54:45,826 --> 00:54:47,286
And I remember Martin saying,

992
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:50,038
"What about Bill?
What if Bill sees?"

993
00:54:50,122 --> 00:54:52,708
And my mom replying,

994
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:55,544
"I don't care."

995
00:54:55,627 --> 00:54:57,963
"I don't care."

996
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:05,387
Hey, Lou?
Mm-hmm.

997
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:09,850
You make me feel less cynical.

998
00:55:12,186 --> 00:55:14,563
(Samantha) My turn?
My turn. Uh...

999
00:55:14,646 --> 00:55:17,149
Favorite TV show.

1000
00:55:17,232 --> 00:55:19,151
The Wonder Years.
Oh, all right, that's nice.

1001
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:23,071
I'm still in love with Winnie Cooper.

1002
00:55:23,155 --> 00:55:25,991
Okay, favorite song.

1003
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:28,577
Beatles.
"Polythene Pam."

1004
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,997
Great choice.
Thank you. Yours?

1005
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,833
"Between the Bars" by Elliot Smith.

1006
00:55:37,127 --> 00:55:39,338
Play it for me.

1007
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:42,674
I actually do have it here.

1008
00:55:42,758 --> 00:55:44,426
You're in luck.

1009
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:48,096
Although this is...
This is really no way to...

1010
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,934
to hear a song.
Just play it.

1011
00:55:52,017 --> 00:55:53,810
Will you at least close your eyes,

1012
00:55:53,894 --> 00:55:55,646
because you got to block out all this other stuff.

1013
00:55:55,729 --> 00:55:58,565
It's really distracting.

1039
00:57:51,928 --> 00:57:53,889
I'm going to trump that though, real quick,

1040
00:57:53,972 --> 00:57:57,768
because you look like a serial killer.

1041
00:57:57,851 --> 00:57:59,478
Let's take another one.

1042
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:01,396
Let me show you a test picture.

1043
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,023
Let me show you how it's done, okay?

1044
00:58:03,106 --> 00:58:04,816
If I were on this website, I'd say,

1045
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,653
"Oh, I'd love to go on
a date with you. Yeah?

1046
00:58:10,113 --> 00:58:12,032
Did you actually pay for that?

1047
00:58:13,116 --> 00:58:14,368
No?
No.

1048
00:58:17,788 --> 00:58:19,414
Can I ask you a serious question?

1049
00:58:19,498 --> 00:58:20,666
Are you color blind?

1050
00:58:26,338 --> 00:58:28,131
Fuck, no.

1051
00:58:28,215 --> 00:58:30,550
Professional.
You do not... no.

1052
00:58:30,634 --> 00:58:32,219
You know what?

1053
00:58:32,302 --> 00:58:33,804
You do not look ready to party.
I think...

1054
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:35,681
Let me just take a look.

1055
00:58:35,764 --> 00:58:38,850
Are you being serious with this?

1056
00:58:38,934 --> 00:58:40,352
We're not in Cancun.

1057
00:58:40,435 --> 00:58:41,728
Eh, no.

1058
00:58:44,523 --> 00:58:45,982
That's my favorite shirt.

1059
00:58:46,066 --> 00:58:47,359
Don't ever do it.

1060
00:58:48,819 --> 00:58:49,945
[laughing]

1061
00:58:50,028 --> 00:58:53,198
Okay, good.
Right?

1062
00:58:53,281 --> 00:58:55,325
Come get in this right now.

1063
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:57,494
Let's do it.
Oh...

1064
00:59:02,416 --> 00:59:03,959
Hubba, hubba.

1065
00:59:04,042 --> 00:59:06,086
Have you had this the whole time?
Yeah.

1066
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:09,381
Why on Earth... you are
endlessly frustrating.

1067
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:12,718
Oh, I would definitely fuck you in this outfit.

1068
00:59:12,801 --> 00:59:15,095
How do you feel?
Good.

1069
00:59:15,178 --> 00:59:18,557
Oh, right?

1070
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,891
Okay, come on.

1071
00:59:51,965 --> 00:59:55,677
[no audible dialog]

1072
01:02:18,653 --> 01:02:21,698
Hey, Mom!
Hey!

1073
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:23,825
You made it. Hi.
Hi.

1074
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:25,243
I'm Kate.
I'm Erica.

1075
01:02:25,327 --> 01:02:26,578
[together]
Nice to meet you.

1076
01:03:14,709 --> 01:03:17,379
Hey, can I help you find something?

1077
01:03:17,462 --> 01:03:21,132
I was looking for some aspirin.
I have a headache.

1078
01:03:21,216 --> 01:03:22,801
Oh, should be in there.

1079
01:03:26,596 --> 01:03:27,973
I got it.
Thank you.

1080
01:03:46,116 --> 01:03:48,243
William.
Hey.

1081
01:03:48,326 --> 01:03:49,828
It's so good to see you again.
How are you?

1082
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:51,788
Great to see you, too, Leslie.

1083
01:03:51,871 --> 01:03:53,832
This is my son, Rusty...
Hi.

1084
01:03:53,915 --> 01:03:55,166
And his girlfriend, Kate.
Hello.

1085
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,252
Nice to meet you.

1086
01:03:57,335 --> 01:03:59,212
This was so nice of you to do this for Samantha, really.

1087
01:03:59,295 --> 01:04:00,880
This is great.

1088
01:04:00,964 --> 01:04:03,133
I'd have done the same thing for you

1089
01:04:03,258 --> 01:04:05,677
if you'd published Suit Monkeys
under my watch. Yeah, well...

1090
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,930
I would like you to meet your daughter, Samantha Borgens.

1091
01:04:09,014 --> 01:04:11,433
You might think you've met Samantha before,

1092
01:04:11,516 --> 01:04:15,311
but this Samantha just received a
starred review from Publisher's Weekly.

1093
01:04:15,395 --> 01:04:17,814
[man]
And life will never be the same again.

1094
01:04:17,897 --> 01:04:20,859
Hi, Dad.
Congratulations.

1095
01:04:20,942 --> 01:04:23,069
Thank you so much.

1096
01:04:23,194 --> 01:04:25,447
And this is my boyfriend, Lou.
Hi.

1097
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,449
Nice to meet you. Very nice
to finally meet you, yeah.

1098
01:04:27,532 --> 01:04:29,325
Mr. Murphy is a talented
writer as well.

1099
01:04:29,409 --> 01:04:31,244
He's my Patricia Highsmith.
I don't know.

1100
01:04:31,327 --> 01:04:33,538
Samantha, can I steal your father for a little bit?

1101
01:04:33,621 --> 01:04:35,623
There's so many young writers around here

1102
01:04:35,707 --> 01:04:37,459
who are just dying to meet him.

1103
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:38,793
He's all yours.

1104
01:04:38,877 --> 01:04:40,795
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1105
01:04:40,879 --> 01:04:44,799
Hey, Sis. Congratulations.
Thank you so much for coming.

1106
01:04:44,883 --> 01:04:47,260
It's so nice to finally meet you.

1107
01:04:47,343 --> 01:04:49,179
Sam tells me you're a huge Stephen King fan.

1108
01:04:49,262 --> 01:04:51,890
I'm like the biggest Stephen King fan in the world.

1109
01:04:51,973 --> 01:04:53,683
I love The Sand.
It's my favorite one.

1110
01:04:53,767 --> 01:04:55,393
What?
Since when?

1111
01:04:55,477 --> 01:04:57,020
What do you mean?

1112
01:04:57,103 --> 01:04:58,438
Who doesn't like Stephen King?

1113
01:04:58,521 --> 01:04:59,898
She doesn't like Stephen King.

1114
01:04:59,981 --> 01:05:01,608
I don't not...
let's leave them.

1115
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:03,276
Let's get... She calls
herself a novelist.

1116
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:04,778
You guys continue this.
We're going to go.

1117
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:08,948
Girls.
Yeah.

1118
01:05:09,032 --> 01:05:11,659
Two champagnes, please.

1119
01:05:11,743 --> 01:05:13,328
How old is she?

1120
01:05:13,411 --> 01:05:15,163
21.

1121
01:05:15,246 --> 01:05:17,123
I wouldn't believe you if you told me she was 18

1122
01:05:17,207 --> 01:05:18,583
much less 21.

1123
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:19,667
How old are you?

1124
01:05:19,751 --> 01:05:21,795
This is my party.

1125
01:05:21,878 --> 01:05:24,047
Stop acting like a pussy.
Nobody's going to tell on you.

1126
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:26,841
And I haven't even told you about
the big tip I'm going to leave you.

1127
01:05:26,925 --> 01:05:29,761
As far as I know, you ordered these drinks for yourself.

1128
01:05:29,844 --> 01:05:32,097
I didn't even see her here.

1129
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:35,683
And here's the drinks
you ordered, Miss. Enjoy.

1130
01:05:35,767 --> 01:05:37,393
I will...

1131
01:05:43,566 --> 01:05:46,319
Thank you.

1132
01:05:46,402 --> 01:05:48,571
Samantha!

1133
01:05:48,655 --> 01:05:50,490
Oh, sorry...

1134
01:05:50,573 --> 01:05:52,826
Don't worry about it. It's your night.
Go have fun.

1135
01:05:55,662 --> 01:05:58,790
Ladies and gentlemen, could I
have your kind attention, please.

1136
01:05:58,873 --> 01:06:01,376
You may come forward if you wish.

1137
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:05,922
I have been trying to get William Borgens
up here to speak to my class for years.

1138
01:06:06,005 --> 01:06:09,592
He's never said no, but he's never said yes, either.

1139
01:06:09,676 --> 01:06:13,638
Tonight, I have him at a certain disadvantage.

1140
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:16,182
My entire class is here, Bill.

1141
01:06:16,266 --> 01:06:18,726
And I insist you come up here and say a few words.

1142
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:22,772
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Borgens.

1143
01:06:28,236 --> 01:06:31,990
Your professor, while a very nice
man, is a sneaky son of a bitch.

1144
01:06:32,073 --> 01:06:34,576
[crowd laughs]

1145
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:38,371
The reason Leslie could never get me up
here to talk about the process of writing

1146
01:06:38,454 --> 01:06:42,458
is I'm not sure I have much to say
about it that could benefit you.

1147
01:06:42,542 --> 01:06:45,795
I still find it all very mysterious,

1148
01:06:45,879 --> 01:06:48,089
years after I wrote my first book.

1149
01:06:48,173 --> 01:06:50,758
And I'm not sure what it is that compels a person

1150
01:06:50,842 --> 01:06:54,262
to continue to play make believe

1151
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:57,724
even after they're an adult.

1152
01:06:57,807 --> 01:07:01,769
My favorite book is a collection
of short stories by Raymond Carver

1153
01:07:01,853 --> 01:07:05,106
called What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.

1154
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:10,695
And in the closing lines of the
title story, Carver says...

1155
01:07:10,778 --> 01:07:14,157
"I could hear my heart beating.

1156
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,869
"I could hear everyone's heart.

1157
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:21,706
"I could hear the human noise we sat there making.

1158
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,711
"Not one of us moved.

1159
01:07:26,794 --> 01:07:29,881
"Not even when
the room went dark."

1160
01:07:29,964 --> 01:07:32,800
And I think that that's what writing is.

1161
01:07:32,884 --> 01:07:35,511
It's listening for that beating heart,

1162
01:07:35,595 --> 01:07:38,264
and when we hear it,

1163
01:07:38,348 --> 01:07:44,145
it's our job to decipher it to the best of our abilities.

1164
01:07:44,229 --> 01:07:46,481
[applause, cheering]

1165
01:07:50,652 --> 01:07:54,447
I'm here because my daughter
Samantha's book is being published

1166
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:56,491
in case you haven't heard.

1167
01:07:56,574 --> 01:07:58,409
This is her success.

1168
01:07:59,494 --> 01:08:01,371
I love you, Dad.

1169
01:08:01,454 --> 01:08:03,581
I love you, too.

1170
01:08:09,754 --> 01:08:11,881
This seat taken?

1171
01:08:14,759 --> 01:08:17,887
Louis invited me.

1172
01:08:17,971 --> 01:08:21,057
Well, that was a calculated risk.

1173
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,850
How long you been here?

1174
01:08:22,934 --> 01:08:27,063
Mm, I was waiting in my car for about an hour

1175
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:29,774
trying to build up the courage to come in.

1176
01:08:31,776 --> 01:08:33,736
So that's what 19 looks like.

1177
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:38,449
She's all grown up now.
No.

1178
01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:40,660
She's still just a baby.

1179
01:08:40,743 --> 01:08:42,036
You going to talk to her?

1180
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,746
I don't know.

1181
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:45,915
I'm scared.

1182
01:08:45,999 --> 01:08:50,253
Yeah, she's scary.

1183
01:08:50,336 --> 01:08:51,838
She's all I've done with my life,

1184
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:54,299
and she doesn't want me.

1185
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:00,179
Hey...

1186
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:05,476
you want some courage?

1187
01:09:07,562 --> 01:09:09,314
Free of charge.

1188
01:09:10,857 --> 01:09:14,068
Yes, please.

1189
01:09:14,152 --> 01:09:16,112
Your favorite book...

1190
01:09:16,195 --> 01:09:19,824
John Cheever's The World of Apples.

1191
01:09:19,907 --> 01:09:22,660
I got you that signed first edition.
Yeah.

1192
01:09:30,084 --> 01:09:32,378
That's your favorite book, right?

1193
01:09:34,047 --> 01:09:38,092
Um, well, I really liked it.
Oh, Jesus.

1194
01:09:38,176 --> 01:09:41,012
I even told you what to read.

1195
01:09:41,095 --> 01:09:42,930
Sometimes.

1196
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,685
I'm sorry.

1197
01:09:53,483 --> 01:09:57,653
Anyway, she swiped it from my library.

1198
01:09:57,737 --> 01:09:59,113
She did?

1199
01:09:59,197 --> 01:10:01,282
Yeah.

1200
01:10:01,366 --> 01:10:04,911
It could only have been her.

1201
01:10:04,994 --> 01:10:06,704
She thought that it was your favorite book.

1202
01:10:06,788 --> 01:10:10,041
That's what I had told her, and...

1203
01:10:10,124 --> 01:10:14,003
I think she was hoping to find some piece of you in it.

1204
01:10:20,093 --> 01:10:22,345
[whispers]
Go talk to your daughter.

1205
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:46,119
Yeah.

1206
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:51,791
Hi.

1207
01:10:56,129 --> 01:10:57,672
Would you sign this for me?

1208
01:11:00,133 --> 01:11:01,968
Uh, what's your name?

1209
01:11:02,051 --> 01:11:04,637
Sam, I don't want to cause a scene.
Really? I--

1210
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,556
I'm Louis, by the way.

1211
01:11:06,639 --> 01:11:08,558
I believe we met over the phone.

1212
01:11:08,683 --> 01:11:10,101
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1213
01:11:10,184 --> 01:11:11,185
Nice to meet you, too.

1214
01:11:11,269 --> 01:11:14,730
Yeah.
Name?

1215
01:11:14,814 --> 01:11:17,150
Come on, Sam, don't do this.
It's okay, Louis.

1216
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:20,194
No name, no problem.

1217
01:11:20,278 --> 01:11:21,696
Guess we'll go with a signature

1218
01:11:21,779 --> 01:11:24,449
and no personalized note. Sam.

1219
01:11:24,532 --> 01:11:27,702
I just wanted to tell you that...

1220
01:11:27,785 --> 01:11:29,412
I love you.

1221
01:11:29,495 --> 01:11:32,039
I love you so much.

1222
01:11:32,123 --> 01:11:34,417
[whispers]
I'm so proud of you.

1223
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,711
[coldly]
Thank you.

1224
01:11:36,794 --> 01:11:38,337
Hope you enjoy it.

1225
01:11:47,472 --> 01:11:49,557
Kate? Kate?

1226
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,727
No, it's just me.

1227
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:56,189
Mom, I didn't know you were coming.

1228
01:11:56,272 --> 01:11:58,816
You Okay?

1229
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,694
[sniffs] You looking for Kate?

1230
01:12:01,777 --> 01:12:03,488
Yeah, I've been looking everywhere for her.

1231
01:12:03,571 --> 01:12:06,199
I can't find her.

1232
01:12:06,282 --> 01:12:07,950
Are you worried?

1233
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:10,244
[sighs]
Yeah.

1234
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:15,041
I'm going to go check in the house.

1235
01:12:15,124 --> 01:12:17,668
Okay, have you guys seen Kate? I've
been looking for her everywhere.

1236
01:12:17,752 --> 01:12:19,545
I can't find her.
I'm freaking out.

1237
01:12:19,629 --> 01:12:21,339
Yeah, the last time I saw her, we were at the bar.

1238
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:23,174
I got her a champagne, but that was ages ago.

1239
01:12:23,257 --> 01:12:24,842
You what?
You got her champagne?

1240
01:12:24,926 --> 01:12:27,261
She's underage.
It's no big deal.

1241
01:12:27,345 --> 01:12:29,180
No, it is a big deal, okay,

1242
01:12:29,263 --> 01:12:31,098
because she has a history and she has a drug problem,

1243
01:12:31,182 --> 01:12:32,308
so she can't drink.

1244
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:33,518
She has a drug problem?

1245
01:12:33,601 --> 01:12:34,810
She had a drug problem.

1246
01:12:36,395 --> 01:12:38,689
Come with me.
She has a drug problem.

1247
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:42,944
Did you give that girl another one?

1248
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:44,278
What girl?

1249
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:47,740
She said they were for you.

1250
01:12:47,823 --> 01:12:49,450
Did you see where she went?
Have you seen her?

1251
01:12:49,534 --> 01:12:50,910
I don't know. She
left with some guy.

1252
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:52,870
Jesus.
Calm down.

1253
01:12:52,954 --> 01:12:55,248
I don't want to calm down.
She's 16 and she's fucked up.

1254
01:12:55,331 --> 01:12:56,749
Take it' easy.
We'll find her, okay.

1255
01:12:56,832 --> 01:12:58,251
Did you look at the guy's ID?

1256
01:12:58,334 --> 01:12:59,794
Do you remember his name?

1257
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:02,046
I look at dates, not names.

1258
01:13:02,129 --> 01:13:03,798
She left with Gus.

1259
01:13:03,881 --> 01:13:05,424
Who the fuck is Gus?

1260
01:13:05,508 --> 01:13:07,593
(Lou) I'm sorry. I'm
sorry, all right?

1261
01:13:07,677 --> 01:13:09,011
(Samantha)
You had no right.

1262
01:13:09,095 --> 01:13:10,972
I didn't think that your Mom

1263
01:13:11,055 --> 01:13:13,182
wanted to miss the most important night in your life.

1264
01:13:13,266 --> 01:13:14,934
We are not having this conversation right now,

1265
01:13:15,017 --> 01:13:16,477
and just stop following me.

1266
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:18,521
Would you just shut up?
Just shut up!

1267
01:13:18,604 --> 01:13:20,231
I'll call you later.
Just please answer.

1268
01:13:20,314 --> 01:13:22,483
Jesus, Dad, this isn't a family vacation.

1269
01:13:22,567 --> 01:13:24,694
Hey, shut up, get in the car.
You're acting like a child.

1270
01:13:24,777 --> 01:13:25,820
(Rusty)
Come on, guys.

1271
01:13:35,162 --> 01:13:37,290
It's number 608.

1272
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:40,835
There it is right there.

1273
01:13:45,631 --> 01:13:47,008
You guys wait here.

1274
01:13:47,091 --> 01:13:48,342
No, Dad, I'm getting out.

1275
01:13:48,426 --> 01:13:50,094
Samantha, you restrain him.

1276
01:13:50,177 --> 01:13:51,677
Don't let him out of the car.
I'm getting out.

1277
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,014
Stay in the car, Rusty.

1278
01:13:53,097 --> 01:13:55,558
Get back in the fucking car!

1279
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:58,227
G. Unit G.

1280
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:11,365
[man]
Who is it?

1281
01:14:11,449 --> 01:14:12,908
Is Kate there?

1282
01:14:12,992 --> 01:14:15,202
Who wants to know?

1283
01:14:15,286 --> 01:14:16,829
[loud music]

1284
01:14:16,912 --> 01:14:19,999
She's a minor, asshole.
She's a minor.

1285
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:21,334
Okay, where is she?
In the bedroom.

1286
01:14:23,961 --> 01:14:25,421
[screams]

1287
01:14:28,382 --> 01:14:29,800
[music stops]

1288
01:14:29,884 --> 01:14:32,053
[crying] (Erica) Bill...

1289
01:14:32,136 --> 01:14:34,430
Help me.
She won't wake up.

1290
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:35,890
Jesus, what did you give her?

1291
01:14:35,973 --> 01:14:37,725
She was drunk Fucking liar!

1292
01:14:37,808 --> 01:14:39,810
Oh, fuck! We did a little coke.
That was it.

1293
01:14:39,894 --> 01:14:41,562
She'll be fine.
I got her.

1294
01:14:41,646 --> 01:14:43,648
You're expelled.
She's just passed out.

1295
01:14:43,773 --> 01:14:46,317
You'll be lucky if that's all that happens.
You can't do that.

1296
01:14:49,779 --> 01:14:50,905
Is she all right?
Is she okay?

1297
01:14:50,988 --> 01:14:54,283
Get in the car.

1298
01:14:55,743 --> 01:14:57,370
Do you have her parents' number?

1299
01:14:57,453 --> 01:14:58,829
Yeah, where's my phone?

1300
01:14:58,913 --> 01:15:00,748
Okay.
What's going on?

1301
01:16:01,976 --> 01:16:05,396
[typing on computer keyboard]

1302
01:16:14,905 --> 01:16:17,116
How's Louis?
Who's Louis?

1303
01:16:28,753 --> 01:16:31,839
Why don't you see if your brother is up yet?

1304
01:16:31,922 --> 01:16:35,259
You don't need to send me
away to talk to Mrs. Wolcott.

1305
01:16:37,178 --> 01:16:40,097
I know you two are sleeping together.

1306
01:16:40,181 --> 01:16:42,141
You don't know shit.

1307
01:16:42,224 --> 01:16:44,894
I know you fuck Tricia Wolcott.

1308
01:16:44,977 --> 01:16:49,940
Hey... go wake up
your brother.

1309
01:16:58,073 --> 01:17:01,577
Rusty, wake up.

1310
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:03,496
Rusty?

1311
01:17:03,579 --> 01:17:06,874
[distant rock music]

1312
01:17:14,924 --> 01:17:16,634
Oh, my God.

1313
01:17:21,263 --> 01:17:25,142
[rock music comes to foreground]

1314
01:18:05,683 --> 01:18:10,771
Dear Rusty, I know you probably
never want' to see me again.

1315
01:18:10,855 --> 01:18:12,815
I did a terrible thing to you.

1316
01:18:12,898 --> 01:18:15,401
My Dad fold me you called to see how I was.

1317
01:18:15,484 --> 01:18:17,319
As I'm sure he fold you, I'm in rehab.

1318
01:18:17,403 --> 01:18:19,780
My biggest mistake other than hurting you

1319
01:18:19,864 --> 01:18:21,782
was thinking you could fix me.

1320
01:18:21,866 --> 01:18:24,535
Only I can fix me.

1321
01:18:24,618 --> 01:18:27,580
I'd like to become a person who actually
deserves to be with someone like you.

1322
01:18:27,663 --> 01:18:31,542
I don't know how long that will fake, but
I hope you're around when if happens.

1323
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:35,921
In the meantime, just know I'm truly
sorry for everything I put you through.

1324
01:18:36,005 --> 01:18:37,923
Love, Kate.

1325
01:18:38,007 --> 01:18:41,051
Oh, P.S. You were
right about that book.

1326
01:18:41,135 --> 01:18:44,388
I cried at the end.
Big time.

1327
01:18:55,357 --> 01:18:59,528
I know it's been a rough couple months...

1328
01:18:59,612 --> 01:19:01,697
but you coming home drunk...

1329
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,824
or stoned...

1330
01:19:03,908 --> 01:19:06,785
every night? Now you've
been in a fight?

1331
01:19:06,911 --> 01:19:10,998
It was payback for something that
happened last fall. I don't care.

1332
01:19:15,252 --> 01:19:18,005
I know it's your first heartbreak.

1333
01:19:18,088 --> 01:19:20,215
I know it hurts.

1334
01:19:20,299 --> 01:19:22,259
Nothing hurts like the first one,

1335
01:19:22,343 --> 01:19:25,888
but you've got to channel this into your work.

1336
01:19:25,971 --> 01:19:27,556
Make something positive out of it.

1337
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,642
Is that what you did when Mom left?

1338
01:19:31,185 --> 01:19:33,020
What?

1339
01:19:33,103 --> 01:19:36,315
Is that what you did when Mom left?
You turned it...

1340
01:19:41,236 --> 01:19:42,529
You're grounded.

1341
01:19:43,948 --> 01:19:46,158
You kidding me, Dad?

1342
01:19:46,241 --> 01:19:48,869
Would you just chill out? You can't ground me.
Yeah, I just did, okay?

1343
01:19:48,953 --> 01:19:50,245
I just did.

1344
01:19:50,329 --> 01:19:51,664
You're the one who told me...

1345
01:19:51,747 --> 01:19:53,707
No journal, nothing.

1346
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:56,126
You're the one who told me to go out and get experiences.

1347
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,796
You can't make me write, Dad.

1348
01:19:58,879 --> 01:20:01,423
I don't have to! You're a writer.
You'll do it yourself.

1349
01:20:13,268 --> 01:20:14,770
When you were little, you used to run down

1350
01:20:14,853 --> 01:20:16,230
to the edge of the water like that

1351
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:18,524
when the tide was pulling out.

1352
01:20:18,607 --> 01:20:20,651
And you would turn around screaming when it came...

1353
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:23,278
I'm letting the ocean get me, Daddy!

1354
01:20:23,362 --> 01:20:26,073
I'm letting the ocean get me!

1355
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:31,078
Your mom used to watch you like a hawk.

1356
01:20:31,161 --> 01:20:34,039
She was terrified that the ocean was going to grab you

1357
01:20:34,123 --> 01:20:36,041
and pull you out to sea.

1358
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:37,710
Why are we talking about her?

1359
01:20:37,793 --> 01:20:39,545
What are we doing down here?

1360
01:20:39,628 --> 01:20:42,006
Your mom loves you.

1361
01:20:42,089 --> 01:20:43,841
She never did anything to you.

1362
01:20:43,924 --> 01:20:46,093
It's pointless. I know
what you're going to say.

1363
01:20:47,845 --> 01:20:49,513
No, you don't.

1364
01:20:49,596 --> 01:20:52,099
Those things she did to me,

1365
01:20:52,182 --> 01:20:54,685
the things you've been holding over her,

1366
01:20:54,768 --> 01:20:57,688
I had already done to her years ago.

1367
01:20:57,771 --> 01:20:59,523
What are you talking about?

1368
01:21:03,152 --> 01:21:04,653
I fell in love with somebody,

1369
01:21:04,737 --> 01:21:06,155
and and got lost, left.

1370
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,073
Bullshit. You were just a baby,

1371
01:21:08,198 --> 01:21:10,159
and your mother waited for me.
Shut up, Dad.

1372
01:21:10,242 --> 01:21:12,411
She waited six months, Samantha.

1373
01:21:12,536 --> 01:21:15,164
And when I realized what a selfish
shit I'd been... Shut up, Dad!

1374
01:21:15,247 --> 01:21:16,915
She took me back.
It's the truth.

1375
01:21:16,999 --> 01:21:19,626
You couldn't tell me, Dad?
Really?

1376
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:21,920
You just made me hate her!

1377
01:21:22,004 --> 01:21:25,215
She made me promise that if she
did something as stupid as I had

1378
01:21:25,299 --> 01:21:27,426
she hoped I'd have the decency to wait for her,

1379
01:21:27,509 --> 01:21:28,927
so I am.

1380
01:21:29,011 --> 01:21:31,430
I should have told you, Samantha.

1381
01:21:31,513 --> 01:21:32,931
I'm sorry.

1382
01:22:01,627 --> 01:22:03,212
I'm sorry.

1383
01:22:08,717 --> 01:22:11,762
She waited six months, Dad.
You've been waiting three years.

1384
01:22:13,889 --> 01:22:16,016
I think you made good on your promise.

1385
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:19,228
It's okay to stop waiting.

1386
01:22:19,311 --> 01:22:25,734
Yeah... She's
coming back.

1387
01:22:25,818 --> 01:22:28,737
What makes you so sure?

1388
01:22:28,821 --> 01:22:30,864
Because she waited.

1389
01:22:30,948 --> 01:22:34,535
And your mother is a far better person than I'll ever be.

1390
01:23:02,354 --> 01:23:06,650
[cell phone buzzing]

1391
01:23:10,863 --> 01:23:13,282
Hello?
Sam?

1392
01:23:13,365 --> 01:23:16,577
[Lou crying]

1393
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:18,162
I'm here.

1394
01:23:18,245 --> 01:23:21,832
She's dead.

1395
01:23:21,915 --> 01:23:26,378
My mom is dead.

1396
01:23:26,461 --> 01:23:29,423
I don't know what to do.

1397
01:23:29,506 --> 01:23:31,508
Mom's dead.

1398
01:23:36,847 --> 01:23:39,516
[Lou sighs]

1399
01:23:44,188 --> 01:23:47,774
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1400
01:25:32,212 --> 01:25:34,339
[Samantha sobs]

1401
01:25:55,944 --> 01:25:58,780
[cell phone buzzes]

1402
01:26:02,367 --> 01:26:06,204
- Hello?
- [man] Hello?
- Is Rusty there?

1403
01:26:06,288 --> 01:26:08,165
This is Rusty.

1404
01:26:08,248 --> 01:26:10,500
Rusty, this is Stephen King.

1405
01:26:12,794 --> 01:26:14,004
Hello?

1406
01:26:14,087 --> 01:26:15,881
Uh, yes, sir.
I'm here.

1407
01:26:15,964 --> 01:26:17,424
Your sister sent me your story,

1408
01:26:17,507 --> 01:26:19,343
I've Just Seen a Face.

1409
01:26:19,426 --> 01:26:21,011
I read it, and I think it's damn good.

1410
01:26:21,136 --> 01:26:24,097
I loved it.
My sister sent it to you?

1411
01:26:24,181 --> 01:26:26,099
Yep, I took the liberty of sending it

1412
01:26:26,183 --> 01:26:28,727
to the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.

1413
01:26:28,810 --> 01:26:30,729
They've published some of my stories over the years,

1414
01:26:30,812 --> 01:26:33,774
and I though! they might
be a good fit for yours.

1415
01:26:33,857 --> 01:26:35,901
Uh, wow, thank you.
Thank you so much.

1416
01:26:35,984 --> 01:26:37,986
You 're welcome.

1417
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:40,030
I think you've got a bright future ahead of you.

1418
01:26:40,113 --> 01:26:41,948
Hey, tell your dad I said hello.

1419
01:26:42,032 --> 01:26:43,784
I'm a big fan of Suit Monkeys.

1420
01:26:43,867 --> 01:26:45,744
It's a classic.

1421
01:26:45,827 --> 01:26:47,412
Keep up the good work.

1422
01:26:47,496 --> 01:26:50,707
Wait!
Mr. King, don't go.

1423
01:26:50,791 --> 01:26:52,042
I'm still here.

1424
01:26:52,125 --> 01:26:54,753
Okay, I just want to...

1425
01:26:54,836 --> 01:26:56,546
I just want to tell you how much your books mean to me,

1426
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:59,633
but I don't even...
I don't even want to try.

1427
01:26:59,716 --> 01:27:01,843
[laughs]

1428
01:27:01,927 --> 01:27:05,555
It's kind of like what you said
in the opening of The Body.

1429
01:27:05,639 --> 01:27:08,975
The most important things are the hardest to say.

1430
01:27:09,059 --> 01:27:12,145
Right, right.

1431
01:27:12,229 --> 01:27:14,147
I can't believe you actually read my story

1432
01:27:14,231 --> 01:27:16,233
and you liked it.
I just...

1433
01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:18,777
I didn't' say I liked it.
I said I loved it.

1434
01:27:18,902 --> 01:27:22,072
Oh, my God Oh, shit. [laughs]

1435
01:27:22,155 --> 01:27:23,865
It was great talking to you, Rusty.

1436
01:27:23,949 --> 01:27:27,786
Okay, yeah. Okay, yeah,
I'll see you, Stephen.

1437
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:40,215
(Bill)
You're going to kill yourself.

1438
01:27:40,298 --> 01:27:42,551
Do you know how to do that?

1439
01:27:42,634 --> 01:27:44,094
Yeah, Dad, I'm doing it.

1440
01:27:47,305 --> 01:27:51,101
[inaudible dialog]

1441
01:28:32,517 --> 01:28:35,687
[knocking]

1442
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:38,023
Hi.
Hi.

1443
01:28:38,106 --> 01:28:39,316
We're here.

1444
01:28:39,399 --> 01:28:40,484
Good to see you.

1445
01:28:42,736 --> 01:28:44,946
They're laughing at your work.

1446
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:46,448
It's not funny.

1447
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:47,824
It's pretty interesting.

1448
01:28:47,908 --> 01:28:49,868
It's really a short story.

1449
01:28:49,951 --> 01:28:51,495
No, no, it's great.

1450
01:28:51,578 --> 01:28:54,623
It's about a detective with Alzheimer's.

1451
01:28:54,706 --> 01:28:56,416
You're kidding me.
No, I'm not.

1452
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,293
[doorbell]

1453
01:28:58,376 --> 01:29:00,712
I'll get it. I invited Kate.
She might come.

1454
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,965
It should be entertaining.

1455
01:29:09,095 --> 01:29:11,181
Mom?

1456
01:29:11,264 --> 01:29:15,101
Hi... Um.

1457
01:29:17,229 --> 01:29:19,439
I kind of pictured your dad opening the door.

1458
01:29:21,483 --> 01:29:23,527
Could you shut it and go get him?

1459
01:29:47,759 --> 01:29:49,219
Hi.

1460
01:29:50,804 --> 01:29:52,222
Hi.

1461
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,602
What are you doing here?

1462
01:30:00,397 --> 01:30:02,065
I got a little lost.

1463
01:30:04,734 --> 01:30:06,611
I was just...

1464
01:30:06,695 --> 01:30:09,864
I was wondering if there's still a place for me here.

1465
01:30:09,948 --> 01:30:11,658
I completely understand if there isn't,

1466
01:30:11,741 --> 01:30:14,953
because I know that
I really... every...

1467
01:30:15,036 --> 01:30:16,538
I really don't deserve it.

1468
01:30:16,621 --> 01:30:18,957
It's okay.
I'm so sorry.

1469
01:30:25,255 --> 01:30:26,506
We got food in here?

1470
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:28,550
You do?
Yeah. Come on in.

1471
01:30:36,433 --> 01:30:37,976
Hi.

1472
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:40,854
Hi.

1473
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:44,941
Rusty, why don't you make a place for your mom?

1474
01:30:45,025 --> 01:30:47,402
No, I got it.
Thanks.

1475
01:30:47,485 --> 01:30:50,572
I'll move this over.

1476
01:30:50,655 --> 01:30:52,782
Yeah.
Move her?

1477
01:30:52,866 --> 01:30:54,159
No, here.

1478
01:30:58,496 --> 01:31:02,834
Thank you.

1479
01:31:02,917 --> 01:31:04,127
Oh, wine glass.

1480
01:31:13,011 --> 01:31:14,304
Thanks.

1481
01:31:20,435 --> 01:31:21,770
Thanks.

1482
01:31:25,815 --> 01:31:27,359
Good, well...

1483
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:41,539
I sold my first story.

1484
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:46,670
Rusty, that's wonderful.

1485
01:31:47,921 --> 01:31:49,214
That's great.

1486
01:31:49,297 --> 01:31:50,548
Uh, it was actually all Sam.

1487
01:31:50,632 --> 01:31:52,467
You wrote it.

1488
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:54,219
I just sent it to the only person I could think of

1489
01:31:54,302 --> 01:31:55,720
who would actually like it.

1490
01:32:00,725 --> 01:32:02,394
A toast.

1491
01:32:06,773 --> 01:32:07,565
To Rusty.

1492
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:10,735
[all]
To Rusty.

1493
01:32:10,819 --> 01:32:12,112
And Happy Thanksgiving.

1494
01:32:12,195 --> 01:32:14,239
[all]
Happy Thanksgiving.

1495
01:32:15,365 --> 01:32:17,158
Happy Thanksgiving.

1496
01:32:24,249 --> 01:32:26,376
(Bill)
I could hear my heart beating.

1497
01:32:27,961 --> 01:32:30,046
I could hear everyone's heart.

1498
01:32:32,549 --> 01:32:37,178
I could hear the human noise we sat there making.

1499
01:32:37,262 --> 01:32:39,431
Not one of us moving,

1500
01:32:39,514 --> 01:32:42,892
not even when the room went dark.
