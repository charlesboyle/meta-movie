1
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,331
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to my underground lair.

2
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:46,502
I have gathered here before me
the world's deadliest assassins.

3
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:52,217
And yet each of you
has failed to kill Austin Powers.

4
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,927
That makes me angry.

5
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:58,640
And when Dr. Evil gets angry,
Mr. Bigglesworth gets upset.

6
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,602
And when Mr. Bigglesworth gets upset...

7
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,230
...people die!

8
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,990
Why must I be surrounded
by fricking idiots?

9
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,250
Mustafa, Frau Farbissina.

10
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,087
I spared your lives
because I need you to help me...

11
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,839
...rid the world
of Britain's top secret agent.

12
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:36,471
The only man who can stop me now.
We must kill Austin Powers.

13
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,022
- Yeah.
Oh! It's Austin.

14
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:15,553
Oh, it's Austin.

15
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,514
Come on, babies.
Work with me, people. All right.

16
00:02:18,682 --> 00:02:20,474
Show me love.

17
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:24,395
Great, baby, yeah.

18
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:28,232
Oh, behave.

19
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,985
It's Austin Powers!

20
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:39,994
Yeah.

21
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:56,636
- It's Austin Powers!
- Aah! Oh, my God!

22
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:50,650
- Hllo, Mrs. Kensington.
- Hello, Austin.

23
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:53,778
Why don't you ever model for me,
Mrs. Kensington?

24
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:57,281
You know how Mr. Kensington
feels about that.

25
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:59,325
Oh, behave.

26
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:04,330
Yeah. Yeah, baby, yeah.

27
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:14,590
Hello, Austin. I'm Basil Exposition,
With British Intelligence.

28
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:19,637
We have just received word that Dr. Evil
is planning a trap for you tonight...

29
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:22,848
...at the Electric Psychedelic
Pussycat Swinger's Club...

30
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:24,517
...here in swinging London.

31
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:26,310
We'll be there.

32
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,787
Yeah, come on, baby.

33
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:48,166
There you go.
Come on swingers, yeah. Yeah.

34
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:56,550
Austin, it's a swinging shindig.

35
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:59,928
It's my happening, baby,
and it freaks me out.

36
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:03,181
Yeah, man!

37
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,410
- Can I get you a drink, Mr. Powers?
- Sure.

38
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:26,413
Austin, we've got to look for Dr. Evil.

39
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:30,460
Wait, I've got an idea.

40
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:34,088
Austin, why on Earth
did you hit that woman?

41
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:36,549
Right. Let me show you, baby.

42
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:40,762
That ain't no woman. It's a man, man.

43
00:05:42,723 --> 00:05:44,515
It's one of Dr. Evil's assassins.

44
00:05:45,726 --> 00:05:47,435
Look out, he's got a knife!

45
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:56,944
Good Work, Mrs. Kensington.
All right, get up. Get up!

46
00:05:57,112 --> 00:06:00,281
Right. Where's Dr. Evil, huh?
Where is he?

47
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:05,286
There's the bastard.

48
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:09,916
Come on, let's go.
Excuse me, coming through.

49
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:11,626
Excuse me.

50
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:18,132
- I've got you now, Dr. Evil.
Not this time.

51
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,972
Come, Mr. Bigglesworth.
See you in the future, Mr. Powers.

52
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:31,605
My God, he's freezing himself.

53
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:45,285
Oh, my God, look!

54
00:06:57,715 --> 00:07:02,261
And so Dr. Evil escaped
and had himself cryogenically frozen...

55
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:05,097
...to return at a time
when free love no longer reigned...

56
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:07,307
...and greed and corruption ruled again.

57
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:25,076
Yes?

58
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,953
- Commander Gilmour?
- Speaking.

59
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:29,289
Commander, this is Ritter
in SoWest Com Three.

60
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:33,126
We have a potential bogey with erratic
vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.

61
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:36,379
What are you saying, son?

62
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:38,798
Well, it appears to be
in the shape of a Big Boy.

63
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:42,051
Good God, he's back.

64
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:44,429
Well, in many ways,
the Big Boy never leff, sir.

65
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,849
He's always offered the same high-quality
meals at competitive prices.

66
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:51,895
- Shut up.
- Shall I scramble TacHO for an intercept?

67
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:56,858
- What's its current position?
- Well, I'm presently tracking it over Nevada.

68
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:58,818
Oh, my God. The Big Boy's gone.

69
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:03,406
Listen, son, I want you to forget
what you saW here today.

70
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:06,117
Philips.

71
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,702
- Call the President.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,457
Prepare the jet. Bring my overnight bag.

73
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:17,755
And, uh, Philips, feed my fish.
Not too much.

74
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:20,257
I'm off to London, England.

75
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,556
Powers volunteered
to have himself frozen...

76
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,767
...in case Dr. Evil should ever return.

77
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:32,520
Well, I hope your boy's up to it.

78
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:38,317
We don't Wanna have to bail
you guys out again, like after WWII.

79
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:41,403
This is our celebrity vault.

80
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:56,752
- Please.
Who is this Austin Powers?

81
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,921
The ultimate gentlemen spy.

82
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,049
Irresistible to women,
deadly to his enemies.

83
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:05,595
A legend in his own time.

84
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:09,641
Attention: Stage One.
Laser cutting beginning.

85
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:13,562
Laser cutting complete.

86
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:30,370
Stage Two:
Warm liquid goo phase beginning.

87
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,001
Warm liquid goo phase complete.

88
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:41,131
Stage Three: Reanimation beginning.

89
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:44,759
Reanimation complete.

90
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,517
Stage Four: Cleansing beginning.

91
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:59,275
Cleansing complete.

92
00:10:21,298 --> 00:10:25,926
Stage Five: Evacuation beginning.

93
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,750
Evacuation com...

94
00:11:06,594 --> 00:11:07,761
Evacuation com...

95
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:12,224
Com... Com...

96
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:15,268
Evacuation com...

97
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:22,150
I don't want Smarties,
I want a Mars bar, Mommy.

98
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:27,781
Wh...? Where am I?

99
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:32,202
You're in the Ministry of Defense.
It's 1997.

100
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,955
You've been cryogenically frozen
for 30 years.

101
00:11:35,748 --> 00:11:37,207
Who are these people?!

102
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,794
The shouting is a temporary side effect
of the unfreezing process.

103
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:45,466
Yes, I'm having difficulty controlling
the volume of my voice!

104
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:48,803
This is Commander Gilmour,
U.S. Strategic Command...

105
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:52,140
...and General Borschevsky,
Russian Intelligence.

106
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:54,809
Russian Intelligence, are you mad?

107
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:59,147
A lot's happened since you were frozen.
The Cold War's over.

108
00:11:59,314 --> 00:12:03,651
Well, finally those capitalist pigs
will pay for their crimes, eh?

109
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:07,780
- Hey, Comrades? Hey?
- Austin, we won.

110
00:12:07,948 --> 00:12:11,284
Oh, groovy. Smashing. Yea, capitalism.

111
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:13,953
Hello. Hello.

112
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:16,456
Mr. Powers!
The President's quite concerned.

113
00:12:16,623 --> 00:12:18,666
We've got a madman
on the loose in Nevada.

114
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:22,795
Dr. Evil. When do I begin?

115
00:12:22,963 --> 00:12:26,007
Immediately.
You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.

116
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:28,259
Mrs. Kensington.

117
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:32,555
Austin,
Mrs. Kensington has long since retired.

118
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:36,476
Ms. Kensington is her daughter.

119
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:38,896
Ah, here she is.

120
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:44,860
Vanessa is one of our top agents.

121
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:56,121
My God, Vanessa's got a fabulous body.
I'll bet she shags like a minx.

122
00:12:57,874 --> 00:13:00,626
How do I tell them
that because of the unfreezing process...

123
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:03,295
...I have no inner monologue?

124
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:08,467
I hope I didn't say that
out loud just noW.

125
00:13:12,722 --> 00:13:16,725
Mr. Powers, my job is to
acclimatize you to the '90s.

126
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:19,186
You know, a lot's changed since 1967.

127
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:23,065
No doubt, love, but as long as people
are still having promiscuous sex...

128
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:25,651
...with many anonymous partners
without protection...

129
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:29,279
...while at the same time
experimenting With mind-expanding drugs...

130
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:34,661
...in a consequence-free environment,
I'll be sound as a pound.

131
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:43,837
- Danger Powers' personal effects.
- Actually, my name is Austin Powers.

132
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:48,591
- It says here, "Name: Danger Powers."
- No, no, no.

133
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:51,427
Danger's my middle name.

134
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:54,764
Okay, Austin Danger Powers:

135
00:13:55,432 --> 00:13:58,893
- One blue crushed-velvet suit.
- Hey, all right.

136
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:02,063
- One frilly lace cravat.
- There it is.

137
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:05,024
One silver medallion with male symbol.

138
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:09,112
- One pair of Italian boots.
- Buongiorno, boys.

139
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,866
One vinyl record album:
Burt Bacharach Plays His Hits.

140
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:19,706
Hey, Burt. How are you?
- One Swedish-made penis-enlarger pump.

141
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,625
That's not mine.

142
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:27,381
One credit card receipt
for Swedish-made penis-enlarger...

143
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:29,091
...signed by Austin Powers.

144
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:32,136
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.

145
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:36,140
One warranty card
for Swedish-made penis-enlarger pump...

146
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,267
...filled out by Austin Powers.

147
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:41,979
I don't even know what this is.
This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.

148
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,982
One book: Swedish-Made
Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me:

149
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:51,989
This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby,
by Austin Powers.

150
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:56,577
- Just sign the form.
- Okay, don't get heavy, man. I'll sign.

151
00:14:56,745 --> 00:14:59,997
You know, just to get things moving,
you know.

152
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,415
You all right, baby?

153
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,628
Listen, Mr. Powers,
I look forWard to Working With you...

154
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:08,839
...but do me a favor
and stop calling me baby.

155
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:13,969
- You can address me as Agent Kensington.
- Oh, come on.

156
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:18,516
- All right, then. Vanessa.
- Was that so hard?

157
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:22,187
Now, come along.
We have to leave immediately.

158
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,773
We've preserved your private jet
just as you left it.

159
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:29,527
- It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
- My jumbo jet? Smashing, baby.

160
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,322
Ooh, sorry.

161
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,449
Mr. Powers.

162
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,539
Quickly.
Quickly, come on, noW. Let's go.

163
00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:58,723
Gentiemen,
welcome to my underground lair.

164
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,893
It's been 30 years, but I'm back.

165
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:06,356
Everything's gone perfectly to plan
except for one small flaw.

166
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:10,068
Due to a technical error
by my henchman, Mustafa...

167
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,739
...complications arose
in the unfreezing process.

168
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:17,660
- My design Was perfect.
- Look what you did to Mr. Bigglesworth!

169
00:16:20,455 --> 00:16:25,167
But, Dr. Evil, we were unable
to anticipate feline complications...

170
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:27,044
...due to the reanimation process.

171
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:28,379
Silence!

172
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,472
Let this be a reminder to you all...

173
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,642
...that this organization
will not tolerate failure.

174
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:50,568
Gentlemen, let's get down to business.

175
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:58,284
- We've got a lot of work to do.
Someone help me.

176
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:02,455
I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.

177
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:07,961
Some of you I know.
Some of you I'm meeting for the first time.

178
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:11,923
Aah. Hello up there. Anyone?

179
00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:15,886
Could someone call an ambulance?
I'm in quite a lot of pain.

180
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:18,472
Okay, you've all been gathered here
to form my evil cabinet...

181
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:20,807
Excuse me.

182
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:22,851
- Yes, he's down there.
Is he dead yet?

183
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:26,313
No, not dead. No, burnt, badly.

184
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:28,565
Should I take care of him,
possibly with a gun?

185
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,192
- Yes.
- Kill him?

186
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,651
Right.

187
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:34,321
If somebody could open
the retrieval hatch down here...

188
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:37,449
...I could get out.
See, I designed this device myself.

189
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:41,745
Oh, hi. Good. I'm glad you found me.

190
00:17:41,913 --> 00:17:44,998
Listen, I'm very badly burned,
so if you could just...

191
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:49,711
You shot me!
- Okay, moving on.

192
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:52,589
You shot me right in the arm! Why did...?

193
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,606
Right. Let me go around the table
and introduce everyone.

194
00:18:08,774 --> 00:18:13,778
Frau Farbissina, founder of the militant wing
of the Salvation Army.

195
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:19,659
Random Task, Korean ex-wrestler,
evil handyman extraordinaire.

196
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:24,038
Random Task, show them what you do.

197
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:41,097
Patty O'Brien, ex-Irish assassin.

198
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:45,059
His trademark, a superstitious man,
he leaves a tiny keepsake...

199
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:48,354
...from his good-luck bracelet
on every victim he kills.

200
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:52,901
Scotland Yard Would love to get their hands
on that piece of evidence.

201
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:56,405
Yeah, they're alWays after
me lucky charms.

202
00:19:01,786 --> 00:19:04,705
What? Why does everyone always laugh
when I say that?

203
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,583
They are after me lucky charms.

204
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:09,543
What?

205
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:15,132
It's a television commercial,
with this cartoon leprechaun.

206
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,593
And all of these children
are trying to chase him.

207
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,263
"Hey, leprechaun man, leprechaun man.
We want to get your lucky charms."

208
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:25,434
Ha, ha. Oh, and there's all of these
little tiny bits of marshmalloWs...

209
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:29,229
...just stuck right in the cereal,
so that When the kids eat them, they think:

210
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:31,523
"Oh, this is candy. I'm having fun."

211
00:19:34,777 --> 00:19:39,364
Finally we come to my number-two man.
His name?

212
00:19:39,782 --> 00:19:40,949
Number TWo.

213
00:19:41,117 --> 00:19:47,999
For 30 years, Number Two has run Virtucon,
the legitimate face of my evil empire.

214
00:19:49,043 --> 00:19:54,797
Dr. Evil, over the last 30 years,
Virtucon has grown by leaps and bounds.

215
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:59,636
About 15 years ago,
we changed from volatile chemicals...

216
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:02,472
...to the communications industry.

217
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:05,934
We own cable companies in 38 states.

218
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:11,814
We own a steel mill in Cleveland,
shipping in Texas' oil refineries in Seattle...

219
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:16,402
...and a factory in Chicago
that makes miniature models of factories.

220
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,655
Naturally, yes.

221
00:20:18,822 --> 00:20:20,490
Gentlemen.

222
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:24,285
I have a plan.

223
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:35,463
It's called blackmail.

224
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:41,011
As you know, the royal family of Britain
are the wealthiest landowners in the world.

225
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:45,307
Either the royal family pays us
an exorbitant amount of money...

226
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:50,020
...or we make it seem that Prince Charles
has had an affair outside of marriage...

227
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:55,067
...and therefore, would have to divorce.

228
00:20:57,153 --> 00:21:01,865
Prince Charles did have an affair,
he admitted it, and they are noW divorced.

229
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:04,451
Right. Okay, you have
to tell me these things.

230
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:09,373
All right?
I've been frozen for 30 years, okay?

231
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:15,879
Throw me a fricking bone here.
I'm the boss. Need the info.

232
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:19,300
Okay, no problem.
Here's my second plan.

233
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:22,511
Back in the '60s,
I developed a weather-changing machine...

234
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,180
...which was, in essence,
a sophisticated heat beam...

235
00:21:25,348 --> 00:21:26,974
...which we called a "laser."

236
00:21:27,142 --> 00:21:32,355
Using these "lasers," we punch a hole
in the protective layer around the world...

237
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:35,692
...which we call the "ozone layer."

238
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,404
Slowly, but surely, ultraviolet rays
would pour in...

239
00:21:39,572 --> 00:21:45,493
...increasing the risk of skin cancer,
that is, unless...

240
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:50,248
...the world pays us a hefty ransom?

241
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,089
That also already has happened.

242
00:21:58,591 --> 00:22:00,008
Shit.

243
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:03,428
Oh, hell,
let's just do what We alWays do:

244
00:22:03,596 --> 00:22:07,432
Hijack some nuclear weapons
and hold the world hostage, yeah? Good.

245
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,434
Gentlemen, it's come to my attention...

246
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:13,104
...that a breakaway Russian republic,
Kreplachistan, is about to transfer...

247
00:22:13,272 --> 00:22:18,109
...a nuclear warhead to the United Nations
in a few days. Here's the plan.

248
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:22,906
We get the warhead
and we hold the world ransom for...

249
00:22:23,657 --> 00:22:26,702
...$1 million.

250
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:34,210
Well, don't you think We should, maybe,
ask for more than a million dollars?

251
00:22:34,378 --> 00:22:38,130
A million dollars
isn't exactly a lot of money these days.

252
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:41,842
Virtucon alone
makes over $9 billion a year.

253
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,388
Really? That's a lot of money.

254
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:50,267
Okay, then.
We hold the World ransom for...

255
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:56,023
...$100 billion.

256
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:01,821
Pretty groovy jumbo jet, eh?

257
00:23:01,988 --> 00:23:06,325
When you see this jet a-rocking
don't come a-knocking, baby, yeah.

258
00:23:06,493 --> 00:23:08,619
I'm gonna need you to sign
these release forms.

259
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,663
- Release forms?
- You're not officially...

260
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:14,375
...working for the Ministry of Defense.
These forms indemnify the Ministry...

261
00:23:14,543 --> 00:23:17,838
...against any, um, mishaps
that may occur in the line of duty.

262
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:22,676
Mishaps? But isn't that what being
an international man of mystery is all about?

263
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:28,515
Okay, name: Austin Danger Powers.

264
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:31,017
Sex: Yes, please.

265
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:36,690
How does a hot chick like you
end up working at the Ministry of Defense?

266
00:23:36,858 --> 00:23:41,820
Oh, well, I went to Oxford
where I excelled in several subjects...

267
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:44,364
...but I ended up specializing
in foreign languages.

268
00:23:44,532 --> 00:23:47,993
You know, I really wanted to travel.
You know, sort of see the World.

269
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:51,204
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen,
why don't We go in the back and shag?

270
00:23:51,372 --> 00:23:53,748
- What?
- I've been frozen for 30 years.

271
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:56,460
I've gotta see
if my bits and pieces are still working.

272
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:59,379
- Excuse me?
- My Wedding tackle.

273
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:01,173
- I'm sorry.
- My meat and two veg.

274
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,841
My twig and berries.

275
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:06,052
- Hello, lads, are you still awake?
- Mr. Powers, Mr. Powers, please.

276
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:09,514
I'd appreciate it
if you could concentrate on our mission...

277
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:12,059
...and give your libido a rest.

278
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:15,146
Can I, uh...?

279
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:18,399
Can I show you something?

280
00:24:31,997 --> 00:24:35,666
I won't bite, hard.

281
00:24:40,297 --> 00:24:42,381
All right.

282
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:46,844
Let me ask you a question,
and be honest.

283
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:54,894
Do I make you horny? Randy?
Do I make you horny, baby? Yeah, do I?

284
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:58,231
God, I hope this is part
of the unfreezing process.

285
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:00,775
Oh, turbulence. Oh, look at that.

286
00:25:00,943 --> 00:25:02,944
Oh, turbulence. Oh, I fell over.

287
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:05,864
- Oh, I fell over again.
- Get off me.

288
00:25:06,032 --> 00:25:07,950
Mr. Powers!

289
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:12,120
I will never have sex With you, ever.
If you were the last man on Earth...

290
00:25:12,288 --> 00:25:15,624
...and I was the last Woman on Earth,
and the future of the human race...

291
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:18,335
...depended on our having sex
simply for procreation...

292
00:25:18,503 --> 00:25:20,754
...I still would not have sex With you.

293
00:25:21,631 --> 00:25:23,632
What's your point, Vanessa?

294
00:25:40,108 --> 00:25:41,567
Yeah.

295
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:44,403
Remember when We froze your semen?

296
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:47,114
You said if it didn't look
like you were coming back...

297
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:49,074
...we should try to make you a son...

298
00:25:49,242 --> 00:25:51,743
...so that a part of you could live forever?
- Oh, sure.

299
00:25:51,911 --> 00:25:57,165
Well, after a couple of years,
we got a little impatient.

300
00:25:57,334 --> 00:26:01,504
Dr. Evil, I Want you to meet your son.

301
00:26:01,672 --> 00:26:02,839
My son?

302
00:26:04,592 --> 00:26:05,842
Scott!

303
00:26:14,602 --> 00:26:17,812
Hello, Scott.
- Hi.

304
00:26:18,147 --> 00:26:23,192
I'm your father, Dr. Evil.

305
00:26:25,195 --> 00:26:26,863
I haven't seen you my whole life.

306
00:26:27,031 --> 00:26:30,950
And noW you come back
and just expect a relationship?

307
00:26:31,118 --> 00:26:33,328
Pfft. I hate you.

308
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:37,707
What?

309
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:41,836
- Can I have a hug?
No.

310
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,880
- Give me a hug.
No way.

311
00:26:44,048 --> 00:26:45,173
- Come here.
I'm not.

312
00:26:45,341 --> 00:26:46,466
- Let's go.
Forget it.

313
00:26:46,634 --> 00:26:48,343
Pronto.
- What are you doing?

314
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,847
I'm with it. I'm hip.

315
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:09,573
Well, don't look at me like I'm fricking
Frankenstein. Give your father a hug.

316
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:13,494
- You're... Hey. Don't touch me.
- Come on. Hug. Hug.

317
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:16,872
- Get away from me, you lazy-eyed psycho.
- Hug.

318
00:27:33,264 --> 00:27:36,225
Viva Las Vegas, baby! Yeah!

319
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:50,281
- Yeah.
Welcome to Las Vegas, sir.

320
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:58,790
- So which side of the bed do you Want?
- You're sleeping on the sofa, Mr. Powers.

321
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:01,126
In fact, I'd like to take this opportunity...

322
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:03,712
...to remind you
the only reason We're sharing a room...

323
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:06,965
...is to keep up the context
that we're a married couple on vacation.

324
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:11,302
Right. Shall we shag now
or shall we shag later?

325
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,139
How do you like to do it?
Do you like to wash up first?

326
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:18,643
You know, top and tails? Whore's bath.
Personally, before I'm on the job...

327
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:22,605
...I like to give my undercarriage
a bit of a hoW's your father.

328
00:28:23,858 --> 00:28:25,108
I'm just joking, Vanessa.

329
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:29,404
I'm just trying to get a rise out of you,
that's all. For shits and giggles.

330
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,073
Let's unpack.

331
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,916
Gor blimey. Nerd alert.

332
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:56,807
How did this get in here?

333
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:02,146
Somebody's playing a prank on me.
Honestly, it's not mine.

334
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:05,858
Hey, Americans. Yeah. Enjoy that wine.

335
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:07,401
Hey, there you are.

336
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:10,362
- Do I know you?
- No. But that's Where you are, you're there.

337
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,866
Hey, viva Las Vegas, baby.
Hey, how are you?

338
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:15,409
- Okay, Austin?
- Yes.

339
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:18,287
Austin. There's a company in Las Vegas
called Virtucon...

340
00:29:18,455 --> 00:29:21,081
...which we think
may be linked to Dr. Evil.

341
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:24,627
Plenty of the Virtucon executives
are gambling in this casino.

342
00:29:25,086 --> 00:29:28,380
Smashing. Let's go.
Look. There's one over there.

343
00:29:28,882 --> 00:29:30,007
Changing a thousand.

344
00:29:30,175 --> 00:29:32,552
Hello. Excuse me.

345
00:29:36,224 --> 00:29:39,893
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Not at all.

346
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:43,021
Game is blackjack, gentlemen.

347
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,649
Ten thousand dollars minimum bet.

348
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:49,069
King for you, sir. And a three for you.

349
00:29:51,197 --> 00:29:53,156
Seventeen.

350
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:03,667
- Hit me.
- You have 17, sir.

351
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:06,920
I like to live dangerously.

352
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:12,008
Four. Twenty-one.

353
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:15,595
Nice. Nice.
Nice.

354
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:17,055
Well-played.

355
00:30:18,724 --> 00:30:20,267
Five.

356
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,522
I'll stay.

357
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,358
I suggest you hit, sir.

358
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:35,783
- I also like to live dangerously.
As you Wish, sir.

359
00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:41,789
Twenty beats your five. I'm sorry, sir.

360
00:30:41,957 --> 00:30:46,919
Well, I won't lie to you.
Cards are not my bag, baby.

361
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:53,092
Allow myself to introduce... myself.

362
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:58,764
My name is Richie Cunningham.
And this is my wife, Oprah.

363
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:02,810
My name is Number Two.

364
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:09,150
This is my Italian confidential secretary.
Her name is Alotta. Alotta Fagina.

365
00:31:10,611 --> 00:31:13,613
- Come again?
- Alotta Fagina.

366
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,327
I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it. It sounded
like you said your name was a lot of...

367
00:31:19,662 --> 00:31:21,538
Never mind.

368
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:27,502
- What exactly do you do, Mr. Number Two?
- That's my business.

369
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:32,507
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go to the little boys' room.

370
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:35,552
You keep your eye on the Italian bird.

371
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,263
- We'll rendezvous back at the hotel suite.
- Okay.

372
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:40,641
Anything else?
No.

373
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:59,034
You didn't happen to see anything at all?

374
00:32:00,495 --> 00:32:02,204
Sorry.

375
00:32:15,386 --> 00:32:17,053
Howdy.

376
00:32:23,477 --> 00:32:25,728
That is one crazy getup
you got there, fella.

377
00:32:25,896 --> 00:32:27,146
Oh, thank you.

378
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:31,025
- Are you in the show?
- Uh, no, actually. I'm English.

379
00:32:31,193 --> 00:32:35,571
- Ooh. I'm sorry.
- Right.

380
00:32:45,082 --> 00:32:50,086
- Hey, partner. Have a good one.
- Ah. Okay.

381
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:14,987
Hey, partner. Come on,
you gotta relax. Don't force it.

382
00:33:15,155 --> 00:33:17,614
Gonna blow out your O-ring, drop a lung.

383
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:40,137
Who does Number Two work for?

384
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:42,639
That's right, buddy.
You show that turd who's boss.

385
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,229
Hey. Hey, just grab a hold of something,
bite your lip and give it hell.

386
00:33:49,397 --> 00:33:52,441
Come on, we're gonna get through this.

387
00:33:56,738 --> 00:34:00,158
Hey, that sounds pretty nasty.
How about a courtesy flush over there?

388
00:34:09,126 --> 00:34:13,505
Jesus Christ, boy. What did you eat?

389
00:34:24,016 --> 00:34:27,769
Gentlemen, the warhead is ours.

390
00:34:28,312 --> 00:34:32,607
Patch me through to the United Nations
Security Secret Meeting Room.

391
00:34:34,026 --> 00:34:37,195
Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil.

392
00:34:37,363 --> 00:34:42,033
In a little while, you'll notice that the
Kreplachistani warhead has gone missing.

393
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:47,247
If you want it back,
you're going to have to pay me...

394
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:49,958
...$1 million.

395
00:34:56,883 --> 00:34:58,050
Sorry.

396
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:02,429
One hundred billion dollars.

397
00:35:02,597 --> 00:35:05,307
Gentlemen, silence.

398
00:35:05,475 --> 00:35:09,186
- Now, Mr. Evil...
- Dr. Evil.

399
00:35:09,354 --> 00:35:11,605
I didn't spend
six years in evil medical school...

400
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:14,191
...to be called mister,
thank you very much.

401
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:19,530
It is the policy of the United Nations
not to negotiate with terrorists.

402
00:35:19,698 --> 00:35:24,368
Really? So long.

403
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:33,294
Gentlemen, in exactly five days...

404
00:35:33,461 --> 00:35:37,506
...we will be $100 billion richer.

405
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:15,337
Hello? Mummy?

406
00:36:15,504 --> 00:36:20,675
- Oh, hello, Vanessa. And how's Austin?
- He's asleep.

407
00:36:20,843 --> 00:36:24,930
- You didn't.
- No. I made him sleep on the sofa.

408
00:36:25,097 --> 00:36:29,726
- Vanessa, I'm proud of you.
- Why?

409
00:36:29,894 --> 00:36:34,231
Because you've managed to resist
Austin Powers' charms.

410
00:36:34,398 --> 00:36:36,816
Ha, ha. God knows he tried, Mummy.

411
00:36:36,984 --> 00:36:39,278
I actually had to end up being
rather firm with him.

412
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:42,240
What about his teeth? It's really bizarre.

413
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:47,161
Darling, you have to understand,
in Britain in the '60s...

414
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:51,415
...you could be a sex symbol
and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.

415
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:52,875
Did you ever...?

416
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:57,505
Me? No, of course not.
I was married to your father.

417
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:04,470
- Did you ever Want to?
- Austin is very charming, very debonair.

418
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:08,933
He's handsome, witty,
has a knowledge of fine wines.

419
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:12,687
Women want him
and men want to be him.

420
00:37:12,854 --> 00:37:16,440
Every bit
an international man of mystery.

421
00:37:16,608 --> 00:37:18,859
Yeah, you didn't answer my question,
Mummy.

422
00:37:19,027 --> 00:37:20,778
I know.

423
00:37:21,446 --> 00:37:23,531
Let me just say this.

424
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:29,161
Austin was the most loyal
and caring friend I ever had.

425
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:31,623
I will always love him.

426
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,838
- Do you Wanna speak to him?
- No, it's been too long.

427
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,882
Okay, well, I'm gonna have to go, Mummy.
But I love you.

428
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,092
Ciao, darling.

429
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:52,853
A limo's just pulled up.
- Let me see.

430
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,064
That's Dr. Evil's cat.

431
00:37:56,232 --> 00:38:00,652
HoW can you tell?
- I never forget a pussy... cat.

432
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,574
Oh, no. He's gone away.

433
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,872
My God, Vanessa.
You are so incredibly beautiful.

434
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,708
- Oh.
- That's it.

435
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:18,086
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Come on, darling.

436
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,340
I'm gonna take you out
for a night on the town.

437
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:34,771
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Burt Bacharach.

438
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:39,878
Oh, yeah.
Get on with it.

439
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:43,465
I'm gonna do it. Do you want me?
Unh! Oh, go on.

440
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:46,176
- Do you Want me to do it? Okay.
- Yes, go on.

441
00:39:47,512 --> 00:39:51,473
Right hand, green. Oh, no!

442
00:39:53,343 --> 00:39:55,936
You all right? You all right?

443
00:39:56,104 --> 00:40:00,357
Oh, you know what?
Wait a tick, I forgot something in the lobby.

444
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:04,236
Why don't I take the stairs?

445
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:11,661
Why take the stairs
when I could take the escalator?

446
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:20,545
Why take the escalator
when I've got a perfectly good canoe?

447
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:26,968
I know What. I'll take the elevator.

448
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,516
- Austin.
- Yes.

449
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:37,520
- Come and have some champagne With me.
- Okay.

450
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:39,981
Oh, I tripped.

451
00:40:40,149 --> 00:40:42,734
You know, I haven't had this much fun
since college.

452
00:40:42,902 --> 00:40:44,652
Well, I'm sorry.

453
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,573
- Why?
- I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.

454
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:55,371
Always wanting to have fun, Austin.
That's you in a nutshell.

455
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:56,873
No, this is me in a nutshell.

456
00:40:57,041 --> 00:41:00,627
Help. I'm in a nutshell.
How did I get into this nutshell?

457
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:03,087
Look at the size of this
bloody, great, big nutshell.

458
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:08,010
What sort of shell has a nut like this?
I mean, this is crazy.

459
00:41:08,178 --> 00:41:11,096
Yes. Look at you.

460
00:41:11,264 --> 00:41:12,765
- You're smashed.
- No, I'm not.

461
00:41:12,933 --> 00:41:15,184
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not. I'm the sensible one.

462
00:41:15,352 --> 00:41:18,103
I'm always the designated driver.

463
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:22,900
- Kiss me.
- I can't, darling.

464
00:41:23,068 --> 00:41:25,277
- Why not?
- Because you're drunk. It's not right.

465
00:41:25,445 --> 00:41:27,112
No, I'm not drunk. I'm beginning to see...

466
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,907
...what my mummy was talking about
all those years ago.

467
00:41:30,075 --> 00:41:31,116
I can't.

468
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:35,955
All right, well, tell me
all about my mummy in the '60s.

469
00:41:36,122 --> 00:41:38,457
I'm dying to know what she was like.

470
00:41:39,334 --> 00:41:42,086
She was very groovy.

471
00:41:44,464 --> 00:41:47,007
Your dad loved her very much.

472
00:41:49,427 --> 00:41:52,304
If there Was one other cat in this world
that could've loved her...

473
00:41:52,472 --> 00:41:57,059
...and treated her as well as your dad,
well, it was me.

474
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:02,774
But unfortunately for yours truly...

475
00:42:05,444 --> 00:42:07,862
...that train has sailed.

476
00:42:11,617 --> 00:42:15,829
Vanessa? Vanessa? Hello?

477
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:20,208
Come on. Roll over. Sleepy time.

478
00:42:24,463 --> 00:42:26,631
Okay, Austin needs his hand back.

479
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,891
You've got mail.

480
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:41,354
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition
from British Intelligence.

481
00:42:41,522 --> 00:42:45,025
Now, I want you to find out
what part Virtucon plays...

482
00:42:45,192 --> 00:42:48,028
...in something called Project Vulcan.

483
00:42:48,195 --> 00:42:52,199
I'll need you to go
to Alotta Fagina's penthouse immediately.

484
00:43:19,603 --> 00:43:21,562
Hello, hello.

485
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:27,693
Smashing. Love it. Okay. Yes, yes.
Okay, great.

486
00:43:31,823 --> 00:43:37,411
Project Vulcan.
Yeah, okay. Cheeky, huh? Yeah.

487
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:40,414
Come on, baby. Give it to me.
Yes. Yes. Yes. No! No!

488
00:43:49,217 --> 00:43:52,886
You seem surprised to see me,
Miss Fagina.

489
00:43:53,346 --> 00:43:57,599
What do you want,
Mr. Cunningham' was it?

490
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:00,435
Your boss, Number Two.

491
00:44:01,104 --> 00:44:05,732
I understand that cat's involved
in big underground drills.

492
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,442
How did you know?

493
00:44:08,027 --> 00:44:11,822
I didn't, baby. You just told me.

494
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:14,533
We can talk about business later.

495
00:44:14,701 --> 00:44:17,285
Let me slip into
something more comfortable.

496
00:44:17,453 --> 00:44:20,288
Oh, behave.

497
00:44:30,425 --> 00:44:32,134
Good God.

498
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,571
Me?

499
00:45:09,214 --> 00:45:14,135
Come in and I'll show you
everything you need to know.

500
00:45:36,993 --> 00:45:38,994
Come on.

501
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:50,881
- May I wash you?
- Oh, groovy, baby. Yeah.

502
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:04,812
Mm, yes. That feels yummy.

503
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:17,574
In Japan, men come first
and women come second.

504
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:19,409
Or sometimes not at all.

505
00:46:23,373 --> 00:46:27,377
- Care for some sake?
- Sake it to me, baby.

506
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:35,885
Yes. Kinky. Clinky.

507
00:46:45,104 --> 00:46:47,438
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?

508
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:52,944
Mm. I feel extreme relaxation.

509
00:46:57,366 --> 00:47:00,159
How dare you break wind before me.

510
00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:02,370
I'm sorry, baby.
I didn't know it was your turn.

511
00:47:06,959 --> 00:47:09,460
Pardon me for being rude
It was not me, it was my food

512
00:47:09,628 --> 00:47:14,090
It just popped up to say hello
And now it's gone back down below

513
00:47:14,258 --> 00:47:16,885
That's beautiful. Thank you.

514
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:24,602
Let's make love,
you silly, hairy little man.

515
00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:26,687
I say. Hello, vicar.

516
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,569
Oh, there. That's the spot, all right.
That's the spot right there.

517
00:47:33,737 --> 00:47:35,613
Look at that now. Ha, ha. Good God.

518
00:47:40,911 --> 00:47:45,456
Austin Powers is getting too close.
Any suggestions?

519
00:47:47,542 --> 00:47:52,671
I have created the ultimate weapon
to defeat Austin Powers.

520
00:47:53,882 --> 00:47:56,300
Bring in the Fembots!

521
00:48:10,983 --> 00:48:13,526
Go, Fembots!

522
00:48:15,696 --> 00:48:19,824
These are the latest word
in android-replicant technology.

523
00:48:19,992 --> 00:48:26,706
Lethal, efficient, brutal.
No man can resist their charm.

524
00:48:26,874 --> 00:48:29,584
Send in the guards!

525
00:48:33,047 --> 00:48:36,299
Kill these women.

526
00:48:59,907 --> 00:49:04,412
Ouite impressive.
- Thank you, Herr Doctor.

527
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:08,874
I like to see girls of that "caliber."

528
00:49:12,963 --> 00:49:16,924
By caliber, of course I mean
both the size of their gun barrels...

529
00:49:17,092 --> 00:49:23,514
...and the high quality of their characters.
Two meanings, caliber. It's a homonym.

530
00:49:26,268 --> 00:49:28,144
Forget it.

531
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,441
At ease, boys.

532
00:49:35,527 --> 00:49:40,448
Austin, I Want to show you something.
We're going to outfit you With this.

533
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:45,578
It looks like a watch, but in fact
it's a geosynchronous positioning device.

534
00:49:45,746 --> 00:49:47,705
Very shagadelic.

535
00:49:47,873 --> 00:49:51,292
- And then there's this.
- Okay, let me guess.

536
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,921
The floss is garrote Wire,
the toothpaste is plastic explosives...

537
00:49:56,089 --> 00:49:59,468
...and the toothbrush
is the detonation device.

538
00:49:59,635 --> 00:50:01,219
No, actually.

539
00:50:01,387 --> 00:50:05,766
Since you've been frozen, there have been
fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.

540
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:08,185
What do you mean?

541
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:09,770
Nothing.

542
00:50:09,937 --> 00:50:11,646
Oh, look, here's Basil.

543
00:50:11,814 --> 00:50:13,398
- Hello, Exposition.
- Austin.

544
00:50:13,941 --> 00:50:15,776
Let me bring you up to speed.

545
00:50:15,943 --> 00:50:19,946
Dr. Evil has hijacked
a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan.

546
00:50:20,114 --> 00:50:22,157
Only two things scare me...

547
00:50:22,325 --> 00:50:24,326
...and one is nuclear war.

548
00:50:24,869 --> 00:50:26,578
- What's the other?
- Excuse me?

549
00:50:26,788 --> 00:50:29,039
What's the other thing that scares you?

550
00:50:29,207 --> 00:50:31,666
- Carnies.
- What?

551
00:50:31,834 --> 00:50:34,628
Circus folk. Nomads, you know.

552
00:50:34,796 --> 00:50:36,546
They smell like cabbage.

553
00:50:36,714 --> 00:50:38,090
Small hands.

554
00:50:38,257 --> 00:50:41,760
- Oh. Indeed.
- Perhaps these photographs...

555
00:50:41,928 --> 00:50:44,262
...are the last piece of the puzzle.

556
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:46,848
I've uncovered the details
of Project Vulcan.

557
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:49,559
Oh, good God, an underground missile?

558
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:51,687
Austin, where did you find these?

559
00:50:51,855 --> 00:50:55,691
Austin did some reconnaissance work
last night at Alotta Fagina's penthouse.

560
00:50:57,277 --> 00:51:00,822
- Our next move is to infiltrate Virtucon.
- What?

561
00:51:00,989 --> 00:51:02,615
Any ideas?

562
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:04,534
Oh, yes.

563
00:51:04,701 --> 00:51:07,620
Virtucon runs a tour
of its facility every hour.

564
00:51:07,788 --> 00:51:10,248
I thought perhaps we could
disguise ourselves as tourists...

565
00:51:10,415 --> 00:51:13,126
...and do some on-site reconnaissance.

566
00:51:13,293 --> 00:51:15,002
Top-drawer, Kensington.

567
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:18,714
Oh, uh, Austin, I'd like you
to meet somebody.

568
00:51:18,882 --> 00:51:21,676
This is my mother, Mrs. Exposition.

569
00:51:21,844 --> 00:51:23,344
How do you do?

570
00:51:27,057 --> 00:51:28,641
My God, man, what have you done?

571
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:31,561
That's not your mother, it's a man, baby!

572
00:51:31,728 --> 00:51:33,813
- Yeah, yeah, come off.
- No!

573
00:51:33,981 --> 00:51:36,399
- Why won't this wig come off?
- My head!

574
00:51:36,817 --> 00:51:38,651
Help!
Austin!

575
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:42,905
- Yeah, hold on, hold on, one second.
- No, no, let go of my mother!

576
00:51:43,073 --> 00:51:45,409
Oh, mother. Mother, are you all right?

577
00:51:45,577 --> 00:51:47,578
- What?
- Austin, have you gone mad?

578
00:51:47,745 --> 00:51:49,121
No.

579
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:51,373
You have a lot of explaining to do.

580
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,168
I'm sorry, Basil,
I thought she was a man.

581
00:51:54,335 --> 00:51:56,920
Damn it, man!
You're talking about my mother!

582
00:51:57,088 --> 00:51:59,548
- You have to admit, she is rather mannish.
- Austin.

583
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:02,092
Well, no offense,
but if that is a woman...

584
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:05,012
...it does look like she was beaten
with an ugly stick.

585
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,181
What?
- Really, Austin.

586
00:52:13,188 --> 00:52:19,026
Okay, give in to the beauty of your feelings
and say the Words. Come on.

587
00:52:20,028 --> 00:52:22,613
I love you, Dad.

588
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,949
I love you too son.

589
00:52:26,117 --> 00:52:28,577
That's a breakthrough. Breakthrough.

590
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:33,999
Okay, group, we have some
newcomers here today with us.

591
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:38,129
Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr...

592
00:52:38,297 --> 00:52:42,258
- "Avil"?
- Evil, actually.

593
00:52:44,011 --> 00:52:46,930
Dr. Evil.

594
00:52:47,306 --> 00:52:50,141
Hello, Dr. Evil. Hello, Scott.

595
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:52,060
Hello, everybody.

596
00:52:52,228 --> 00:52:54,229
So, Scott, why don't we start with you.

597
00:52:54,396 --> 00:52:56,773
What brings you here With us today?

598
00:52:57,816 --> 00:53:00,485
Well, I just really met my Dad
for the first time five days ago.

599
00:53:00,653 --> 00:53:03,238
I was partially frozen his whole life.

600
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:07,325
That is beautiful
that you can admit to that.

601
00:53:07,576 --> 00:53:10,912
He comes back and now he Wants me
to take over the family business.

602
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,415
But Scott, who's gonna take over
the world when I die?

603
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:18,795
Listen to the words he used: "Who's going
to take over the world when I die?"

604
00:53:19,505 --> 00:53:22,757
It feels like that to some of us
sometimes, doesn't it?

605
00:53:22,925 --> 00:53:26,302
So, What do you Want to do, Scott?

606
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,806
I don't knoW.
I was thinking I like animals...

607
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:32,518
...maybe I'd be a vet.
- An evil vet?

608
00:53:32,686 --> 00:53:35,312
No. Maybe, like, Work in a petting zoo.

609
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,273
An evil petting zoo?

610
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,401
- You alWays do that!
- Wha...? I...

611
00:53:42,028 --> 00:53:45,948
I just think, like, he hates me.
I really think he wants to kill me.

612
00:53:46,116 --> 00:53:49,201
Now, Scott, we don't want to kill
each other in here...

613
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:52,997
...we might say that we do sometimes,
but we really don't.

614
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:57,459
Actually, the boy's quite astute.
I really am trying to kill him.

615
00:53:57,627 --> 00:53:59,712
But so far unsuccessfully.

616
00:53:59,879 --> 00:54:02,881
He's quite wily, like his old man.

617
00:54:04,968 --> 00:54:06,969
This is what I'm talking about.

618
00:54:07,137 --> 00:54:08,721
Okay, well...

619
00:54:08,888 --> 00:54:10,514
...we've heard from you, Scott...

620
00:54:10,682 --> 00:54:13,684
...now, uh, you tell us
a little about yourself.

621
00:54:13,852 --> 00:54:17,354
The details of my life
are quite inconsequential.

622
00:54:17,522 --> 00:54:20,566
Oh, no, please, please.
Let's hear about your childhood.

623
00:54:20,734 --> 00:54:22,151
Yeah.
Come on. Come on.

624
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:24,612
- Come on. Come on.
Please.

625
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:28,700
Very well, where do I begin?

626
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,579
My father was a relentlessly
self-improving boulangerie owner...

627
00:54:32,747 --> 00:54:37,000
...from Belgium With low-grade narcolepsy
and a penchant for buggery.

628
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:39,919
My mother was a 15-year-old
French prostitute...

629
00:54:40,087 --> 00:54:42,714
...named Chloe with webbed feet.

630
00:54:42,882 --> 00:54:45,925
My father would womanize,
he would drink...

631
00:54:46,093 --> 00:54:50,263
...he would make outrageous claims,
like he invented the question mark.

632
00:54:50,431 --> 00:54:53,933
Sometimes he would accuse
chestnuts of being lazy.

633
00:54:54,435 --> 00:54:58,355
The sort of general malaise
that only the genius possess...

634
00:54:58,522 --> 00:55:01,107
...and the insane lament.

635
00:55:01,275 --> 00:55:03,526
My childhood was typical.

636
00:55:03,694 --> 00:55:07,113
Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.

637
00:55:07,281 --> 00:55:10,033
In the spring we'd make meat helmets.

638
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:14,412
When I was insolent, I Was placed
in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds.

639
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,082
Pretty standard, really.

640
00:55:17,249 --> 00:55:20,086
At the age of 12
I received my first scribe.

641
00:55:20,253 --> 00:55:22,922
At the age of 14,
a Zoroastrian named Vilma...

642
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:26,342
...ritualistically shaved my testicles.

643
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:29,470
There really is nothing
like a shorn scrotum.

644
00:55:29,638 --> 00:55:32,473
It's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.

645
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:35,142
You know, we have to stop.

646
00:55:36,645 --> 00:55:39,313
Can I have a word with you?
Of course you may, love.

647
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:44,318
Look, I know I'm being neurotic...

648
00:55:44,486 --> 00:55:48,155
...but I can't shake off this suspicious
feeling about that Italian secretary...

649
00:55:48,323 --> 00:55:49,907
...you know, Ms. Fagina.

650
00:55:50,075 --> 00:55:52,451
I don't want to sound paranoid...

651
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:55,287
...but I've had some bad relationships
in the past...

652
00:55:55,455 --> 00:55:58,416
...and I have been known to be jealous.
I'm sorry.

653
00:55:58,583 --> 00:56:00,626
No, don't be sorry, baby.

654
00:56:01,044 --> 00:56:03,045
You're right to be suspicious.

655
00:56:03,213 --> 00:56:05,506
- I shagged her.
- What?

656
00:56:05,674 --> 00:56:08,092
I shagged her rotten, baby, yeah.

657
00:56:08,844 --> 00:56:11,805
I don't believe you, Austin.
I mean, she was repellent.

658
00:56:12,181 --> 00:56:14,808
Saucer of milk, table two.
Rwar.

659
00:56:14,976 --> 00:56:17,102
- Well, did you use protection?
- Of course.

660
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:19,187
I had my 9 mm automatic.

661
00:56:19,939 --> 00:56:22,441
You know I meant
did you use a condom?

662
00:56:22,608 --> 00:56:23,692
No.

663
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,194
Only sailors use condoms, baby.

664
00:56:26,362 --> 00:56:27,821
Not in the '90s, Austin.

665
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:31,575
Well, they should, those filthy beggars,
they go from port to port.

666
00:56:31,742 --> 00:56:34,035
Well, Vanessa, don't have a thrombo.

667
00:56:34,203 --> 00:56:38,331
- Alotta meant nothing to me.
- Well, it means something to me.

668
00:56:38,499 --> 00:56:40,375
If you want us to have a relationship...

669
00:56:40,543 --> 00:56:43,378
...you have to get it into your head
that times have changed.

670
00:56:43,546 --> 00:56:45,964
You can't just go off
shagging anybody anymore.

671
00:56:46,132 --> 00:56:49,676
And if you could,
I wouldn't because I'm not like that.

672
00:56:49,844 --> 00:56:51,553
Vanessa.

673
00:56:53,473 --> 00:56:55,015
You're everything to me.

674
00:56:55,391 --> 00:56:57,309
You just don't get it, do you?

675
00:56:59,562 --> 00:57:01,188
Good night, Austin.

676
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:03,398
Welcome to the '90s...

677
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:05,693
...you're gonna be very lonely.

678
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:29,258
Hey. Hey, check this guy out.

679
00:57:30,385 --> 00:57:32,929
- Peace.
- Peace. Peace.

680
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:42,230
Jimi Hendrix, deceased.

681
00:57:42,397 --> 00:57:44,232
Drugs.

682
00:57:44,399 --> 00:57:46,609
Janis Joplin...

683
00:57:46,777 --> 00:57:48,444
...deceased, alcohol.

684
00:57:48,737 --> 00:57:51,447
Mama Cass, deceased...

685
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:54,492
...ham sandwich.

686
00:58:20,144 --> 00:58:23,021
Oh, jeez, that's great.
Is the lighting halfway decent?

687
00:58:23,189 --> 00:58:26,942
Yes, indeed. They've got the flag
up now.? Ou can see the stars and stripes.

688
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:28,860
Beautiful, just beautiful.

689
00:58:33,783 --> 00:58:35,492
Good morning, Austin.

690
00:58:37,161 --> 00:58:40,872
You know, I sometimes forget
you've missed out on the last 30 years.

691
00:58:41,624 --> 00:58:43,292
The fall of the Berlin Wall...

692
00:58:43,459 --> 00:58:45,836
...the first female British prime minister...

693
00:58:46,004 --> 00:58:47,421
...end of apartheid.

694
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:50,800
Yeah, and I can't believe
Liberace was gay.

695
00:58:50,968 --> 00:58:55,138
I mean, Women loved him.
I didn't see that one coming, no.

696
00:58:55,931 --> 00:58:58,975
The tour is about to begin.
So if you please take your seats.

697
00:58:59,727 --> 00:59:02,520
Welcome to Virtucon,
the company of the future.

698
00:59:02,855 --> 00:59:05,356
Virtucon is a leading manufacturer
of many items...

699
00:59:05,524 --> 00:59:07,358
...you can find right in your very own home.

700
00:59:07,526 --> 00:59:09,485
Do you think she's prettier than me?

701
00:59:09,653 --> 00:59:11,904
- Who?
- You know who.

702
00:59:12,072 --> 00:59:13,740
Oh, the Italian bird.

703
00:59:13,907 --> 00:59:16,367
No, baby, she's rancid.

704
00:59:16,535 --> 00:59:20,872
I think you're shagadelic, baby.
You're switched-on. You're smashing.

705
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,209
We make steel, petroleum products
and volatile chemicals.

706
00:59:25,377 --> 00:59:28,546
But don't worry
about the Italian bird, okay?

707
00:59:28,714 --> 00:59:32,050
She's the village bicycle,
everyone's had a ride.

708
00:59:32,217 --> 00:59:33,718
You're using a Virtucon product.

709
00:59:33,886 --> 00:59:38,306
On your right, you'll notice a door
leading to a restricted area.

710
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:41,809
- Only authorized personnel are alloWed.
I'll take him.

711
00:59:42,311 --> 00:59:44,229
You take her.

712
00:59:58,912 --> 01:00:00,412
Let's go.

713
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:03,082
It's Bolton. We've got a problem.

714
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,627
Intruders in the compound.

715
01:00:06,795 --> 01:00:08,504
Aah! Watch out!

716
01:00:09,923 --> 01:00:11,632
Security, this way. Where did he go?

717
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,509
Judo chop.

718
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:17,596
They're coming.

719
01:00:17,764 --> 01:00:19,640
Hang on, I'm gonna floor it.

720
01:00:19,808 --> 01:00:22,726
Watch out. Move! Move! Move!

721
01:00:25,063 --> 01:00:26,271
Careful, Austin.

722
01:00:26,773 --> 01:00:28,524
No!

723
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:33,779
- Watch out.
No!

724
01:00:35,448 --> 01:00:38,493
- Watch out.
- No!

725
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:44,541
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

726
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:49,671
Oh, thank goodness we made it, Austin.

727
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:53,216
- All right, stay very cool, baby.
- Okay.

728
01:01:16,949 --> 01:01:18,742
Mr. Powers.

729
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:21,745
Welcome to my underground lair.

730
01:01:22,329 --> 01:01:23,913
You're just in time.

731
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:25,915
Enjoy the show.

732
01:01:32,215 --> 01:01:36,093
Gentlemen, I give you the Vulcan.

733
01:01:36,261 --> 01:01:39,847
The world's most powerful
subterranean drill.

734
01:01:40,015 --> 01:01:43,350
- Does that make you horny?
- Not now, Austin.

735
01:01:43,602 --> 01:01:46,353
So powerful it can penetrate
the Earth's crust...

736
01:01:46,521 --> 01:01:48,856
...delivering a 50 kiloton
nuclear warhead...

737
01:01:49,024 --> 01:01:51,484
...deep into the liquid hot core
of the planet.

738
01:01:51,651 --> 01:01:55,279
Upon detonation, every volcano
on Earth...

739
01:01:55,447 --> 01:01:57,198
...will erupt.

740
01:01:59,868 --> 01:02:03,579
It seems we have no choice
but to pay your ransom.

741
01:02:03,747 --> 01:02:05,581
You have my instructions. Bye-bye.

742
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,462
Check it out, Butt-Head,
this chick has three boobs.

743
01:02:13,548 --> 01:02:14,965
How many butts does she have?

744
01:02:22,557 --> 01:02:26,311
Do you like your
quasi-futuristic clothes, Mr. Powers?

745
01:02:26,479 --> 01:02:28,814
I designed them myself.

746
01:02:43,913 --> 01:02:47,165
Scott. Scott, my boy, how are you?

747
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:48,416
How Was your day?

748
01:02:48,584 --> 01:02:51,002
Well, my friend Sweet Jay
took me to that video arcade...

749
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:53,964
...and they don't speak English,
so Jay got into a fight...

750
01:02:54,131 --> 01:02:57,259
...and he's all, "Quit hassling me
because I don't speak French."

751
01:02:57,426 --> 01:03:00,846
And the guy says something in Paris talk
and I'm like, "Just back off."

752
01:03:01,013 --> 01:03:03,890
And they're all, "Get out."
And we're like, "Make me."

753
01:03:04,058 --> 01:03:06,184
It was cool.

754
01:03:06,352 --> 01:03:07,602
Fascinating.

755
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:09,771
What are your plans for this evening?

756
01:03:09,939 --> 01:03:12,941
I thought I'd stay in. There's a good
titty movie on Skinemax.

757
01:03:13,109 --> 01:03:16,278
And that's how you'd like
to live your life, is it?

758
01:03:16,445 --> 01:03:17,613
Yeah.

759
01:03:18,907 --> 01:03:21,534
- Pretty much. Yeah, okay.
What?

760
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:28,958
Scott...

761
01:03:29,126 --> 01:03:34,255
...I Want you to meet Daddy's nemesis,
Austin Powers.

762
01:03:34,965 --> 01:03:37,925
What are you feeding him?
Why don't you just kill him?

763
01:03:38,093 --> 01:03:40,928
No, Scott. I have an even better idea.

764
01:03:41,096 --> 01:03:43,806
I'm going to place him
in an easily-escapable situation...

765
01:03:43,974 --> 01:03:47,476
...involving an overly-elaborate
and exotic death.

766
01:03:48,437 --> 01:03:50,146
Why don't you just shoot him now?

767
01:03:50,314 --> 01:03:52,899
I mean, I'll go get a gun.
We'll shoot him together. It'll be fun:

768
01:03:53,066 --> 01:03:54,817
Bang! Dead. Done.

769
01:03:54,985 --> 01:03:59,780
One more peep out of you and you
are grounded, mister, and I am not joking.

770
01:04:02,075 --> 01:04:03,492
All right, let's begin.

771
01:04:04,161 --> 01:04:07,914
Dr. Evil, do you really
expect them to pay?

772
01:04:08,123 --> 01:04:10,751
No, Mr. Powers...

773
01:04:10,919 --> 01:04:14,296
...I expect them to die.

774
01:04:15,006 --> 01:04:16,673
Even after they pay me the money...

775
01:04:16,841 --> 01:04:21,678
...I'm still gonna melt every city
on the planet with liquid-hot magma.

776
01:04:23,598 --> 01:04:25,307
Release the sharks.

777
01:04:25,475 --> 01:04:27,768
Mr. Powers, you'll notice
that all the sharks...

778
01:04:27,936 --> 01:04:30,020
...have laser beams
attached to their heads.

779
01:04:30,188 --> 01:04:34,149
I figure every creature
deserves a Warm meal.

780
01:04:36,027 --> 01:04:37,194
Dr. Evil...

781
01:04:37,362 --> 01:04:39,363
...it's about the sharks.

782
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:43,533
When you were frozen, they were
put on the endangered species list.

783
01:04:43,701 --> 01:04:48,038
We tried to get some, but it would have
taken months to clear up the red tape.

784
01:04:48,873 --> 01:04:52,167
You know, I have one simple request.

785
01:04:52,335 --> 01:04:57,297
And that is to have sharks with fricking
laser beams attached to their heads.

786
01:04:57,465 --> 01:05:02,844
Now, evidently, my cycloptic colleague
informs me that that can't be done.

787
01:05:03,054 --> 01:05:05,723
Uh, can you remind me
what I pay you people for?

788
01:05:05,891 --> 01:05:08,142
Honestly, throw me a bone here.

789
01:05:08,644 --> 01:05:10,019
What do we have?

790
01:05:10,604 --> 01:05:11,980
Sea bass.

791
01:05:15,567 --> 01:05:17,568
Right.

792
01:05:17,736 --> 01:05:20,822
They are mutated sea bass.

793
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:22,156
Really?

794
01:05:22,324 --> 01:05:23,908
Are they ill-tempered?

795
01:05:24,076 --> 01:05:27,036
- Absolutely.
- Well, that's a start. That's something.

796
01:05:27,204 --> 01:05:31,749
All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily
slow-moving dipping mechanism.

797
01:05:34,253 --> 01:05:36,087
Close the tank!

798
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:40,425
Wait, aren't you even gonna watch them?
They could get away.

799
01:05:40,592 --> 01:05:42,593
No, no, no,
I'm going to leave them alone...

800
01:05:42,761 --> 01:05:44,595
...and not actually witness them dying.

801
01:05:44,763 --> 01:05:47,432
I'm just gonna assume
it all went to plan. What?

802
01:05:48,475 --> 01:05:51,936
I have a gun in my room.
You give me five seconds, I'll get it...

803
01:05:52,104 --> 01:05:55,189
...I'll come back down here,
boom, I'll blow their brains out.

804
01:05:55,774 --> 01:05:57,150
Scott...

805
01:05:57,736 --> 01:06:00,404
...you just don't get it, do you?

806
01:06:00,572 --> 01:06:02,072
You don't.

807
01:06:03,283 --> 01:06:04,992
It's no hassle.

808
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,369
But... I'm...

809
01:06:07,537 --> 01:06:08,871
All I'm saying...

810
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:11,081
They're gonna get aw... I...

811
01:06:11,249 --> 01:06:12,624
I'm... We...

812
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:14,418
- We...
- Shh. Knock, knock?

813
01:06:14,586 --> 01:06:16,253
Who's there?

814
01:06:17,088 --> 01:06:18,714
- Look...
- Shh! Let me tell you a story...

815
01:06:18,882 --> 01:06:20,215
...about a man named Shh.

816
01:06:20,383 --> 01:06:22,968
Shh! Even before you start.

817
01:06:23,136 --> 01:06:24,970
That was a preemptive "shh."

818
01:06:25,138 --> 01:06:29,308
Just know I have a whole bag
of "shh" with your name on it.

819
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:35,731
What's your plan?

820
01:06:35,899 --> 01:06:38,650
First, I plan to soil myself.

821
01:06:38,818 --> 01:06:41,445
Then I'm going to regroup
and come up with a new plan.

822
01:06:41,613 --> 01:06:43,489
Any thoughts?

823
01:06:43,656 --> 01:06:45,324
Wait a minute.

824
01:06:46,367 --> 01:06:48,285
I always have this with me just in case.

825
01:06:48,453 --> 01:06:51,956
Okay, I get it. I have bad teeth.

826
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:56,336
No, Austin. The floss is to
swing ourselves onto the ledge.

827
01:06:57,838 --> 01:06:59,297
All right, hold on.

828
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:04,344
Got it. Okay. Toothpaste.

829
01:07:04,637 --> 01:07:06,137
Hello.

830
01:07:09,308 --> 01:07:10,517
Judo chop!

831
01:07:12,812 --> 01:07:14,771
Hang on.

832
01:07:23,697 --> 01:07:25,115
Judo trip.

833
01:07:27,827 --> 01:07:29,869
No!

834
01:07:40,881 --> 01:07:43,466
Not a good time to lose one's head.

835
01:07:43,634 --> 01:07:45,261
Indeed.

836
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:47,847
That's not the way to get ahead in life.

837
01:07:48,014 --> 01:07:49,390
No.

838
01:07:50,475 --> 01:07:53,227
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.

839
01:07:54,938 --> 01:07:57,273
He'll never be the head
of a major corporation.

840
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,775
- Okay, that'll do.
- Okay.

841
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:07,491
No. What are we gonna do?

842
01:08:07,659 --> 01:08:11,036
Oh, look, there's an emergency exit.
Go get help, I'm gonna stay here...

843
01:08:11,204 --> 01:08:12,913
...and keep an eye on Dr. Evil.

844
01:08:13,081 --> 01:08:15,207
Okay, I'll hurry back.

845
01:08:16,877 --> 01:08:18,878
Listen, Vanessa.

846
01:08:20,755 --> 01:08:22,631
Whatever happens...

847
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:25,676
...I Want you to know
that I feel really bad...

848
01:08:25,844 --> 01:08:27,928
...about that Italian bird.

849
01:08:29,264 --> 01:08:31,307
What I'm trying to say is...

850
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:34,977
...that if you want me
to be a one-woman man...

851
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:37,188
...well, that's just groovy, baby.

852
01:08:38,566 --> 01:08:40,233
Behave.

853
01:09:16,729 --> 01:09:18,480
Come, everyone...

854
01:09:18,648 --> 01:09:21,566
...let us repair to the main chamber.

855
01:09:22,151 --> 01:09:25,362
Project Vulcan is about to begin.

856
01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:31,452
Scott, don't you want to see
what Daddy does for a living?

857
01:09:31,745 --> 01:09:33,329
- BloW me.
- Excuse me?

858
01:09:34,498 --> 01:09:36,165
Show me.

859
01:09:37,251 --> 01:09:38,668
Okay.

860
01:09:49,513 --> 01:09:52,014
Position the Vulcan.

861
01:10:05,946 --> 01:10:08,656
Bring in the warhead.

862
01:10:37,103 --> 01:10:38,395
Hello, hello.

863
01:10:38,771 --> 01:10:41,231
- Hello, Mr. Powers.
- Hello, Mr. Powers.

864
01:10:42,608 --> 01:10:45,152
- Care to have a little fun?
- Care to have a little fun?

865
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,070
No, actually, I, uh...

866
01:10:47,238 --> 01:10:48,822
I have to save the World.

867
01:10:59,667 --> 01:11:01,752
Is it cold in here? Heh.

868
01:11:18,103 --> 01:11:20,438
Arm the probe.

869
01:11:33,452 --> 01:11:36,454
Yes.

870
01:11:36,622 --> 01:11:39,874
No! No. No. I've got to get Dr. Evil.

871
01:11:40,042 --> 01:11:41,793
I've got to get Dr. Evil.

872
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,295
No. No. No. Uh, baseball.

873
01:11:44,463 --> 01:11:45,797
Uh, cold showers.

874
01:11:45,964 --> 01:11:47,256
Baseball. Cold showers...

875
01:11:47,424 --> 01:11:48,758
Give it up, Mr. Powers.

876
01:11:48,926 --> 01:11:53,930
Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day!

877
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:56,641
Gentlemen.

878
01:12:00,562 --> 01:12:02,063
Let's lock and load.

879
01:12:02,231 --> 01:12:04,190
Right, lads.
All right, hup, hup.

880
01:12:06,568 --> 01:12:08,069
- Don't go.
- Please don't go.

881
01:12:08,237 --> 01:12:09,695
Stay.
Don't go.

882
01:12:09,863 --> 01:12:11,407
You can't resist us, Mr. Powers.

883
01:12:11,574 --> 01:12:14,159
You can't resist us, Mr. Powers.

884
01:12:14,577 --> 01:12:16,203
Au contraire, baby.

885
01:12:16,371 --> 01:12:18,997
I think you can't resist me.

886
01:12:33,471 --> 01:12:37,349
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

887
01:13:44,126 --> 01:13:45,668
Austin?

888
01:13:45,836 --> 01:13:47,545
Vanessa.

889
01:13:47,713 --> 01:13:49,839
It... It's not what it seems.

890
01:13:51,717 --> 01:13:53,885
- At ease, boys.
- Likewise.

891
01:13:55,596 --> 01:14:00,267
Vanessa, I can explain. See, What happened
was, uh, I broke in trying to get to Dr. Evil.

892
01:14:00,435 --> 01:14:04,188
Then the Fembots came by and smoke
started to come out of their jubblies.

893
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:07,608
So I thought I'd work my mojo,
right, to counter their mojo.

894
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:11,612
We got "cross-mojonations" and their
heads started to explode. You know...

895
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,657
...that thing and I ended up
in my knickers here and then...

896
01:14:16,826 --> 01:14:18,410
Okay, Austin, I believe you.

897
01:14:18,578 --> 01:14:21,455
- Now, get dressed.
- Smashing, baby.

898
01:14:22,457 --> 01:14:24,583
OnWard, boys.

899
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:31,465
Launching the subterranean probe.

900
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:39,098
Begin initial surface penetration.

901
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:46,772
Subterranean nuclear detonation
in three minutes and counting.

902
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:57,659
Watch out!

903
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:04,499
Fight back!

904
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:07,002
Subterranean nuclear detonation...

905
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,504
...in three minutes and counting.

906
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,850
I tripped.

907
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:25,770
Open the fricking door.

908
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:31,234
World destruction, beginning in...

909
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:35,530
Judo. Judo.
10, nine...

910
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:38,658
...eight, seven, six...

911
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:43,872
...five, four, three...

912
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:46,542
...tWo, one...

913
01:15:47,377 --> 01:15:49,879
No!

914
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:56,719
Abort. Abort.

915
01:15:56,887 --> 01:15:58,804
- Abort. Abort.
Hurray!

916
01:15:59,848 --> 01:16:02,308
Abort. Abort.

917
01:16:02,476 --> 01:16:04,977
Now to Dr. Evil.

918
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:07,647
Din-din.

919
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:10,358
I want chicken
I want liver

920
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:14,070
Meow Mix, Meow Mix
Please deliVer

921
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:17,073
I've got you now, Dr. Evil.

922
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:20,409
Well done, Mr. Powers.

923
01:16:20,786 --> 01:16:23,996
We're not so different, you and I.

924
01:16:24,748 --> 01:16:30,503
However, isn't it ironic
that the very things that you stand for...

925
01:16:30,671 --> 01:16:36,592
...free love, swinging' parties,
are all now in the '90s...

926
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,221
...considered to be...

927
01:16:40,431 --> 01:16:41,973
...evil?

928
01:16:42,141 --> 01:16:44,810
No, man, what We swingers
were rebelling against...

929
01:16:44,977 --> 01:16:47,104
...is uptight squares like you...

930
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:50,065
...whose bag was money
and world domination.

931
01:16:50,233 --> 01:16:51,942
We were innocent, man.

932
01:16:52,110 --> 01:16:55,570
If we had known the consequences
of our sexual liberation...

933
01:16:55,738 --> 01:16:59,616
...we would have done things differently,
but the spirit would've remained the same.

934
01:16:59,784 --> 01:17:02,703
It's freedom, baby, yeah.

935
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:06,123
Face it. Freedom failed.

936
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:08,583
No, man, freedom didn't fail.

937
01:17:08,751 --> 01:17:12,045
Right now, We've got freedom
and responsibility.

938
01:17:12,213 --> 01:17:14,631
It's a very groovy time.

939
01:17:14,799 --> 01:17:18,343
There's nothing more pathetic
than an aging hipster.

940
01:17:18,511 --> 01:17:22,639
All right, baldy, shut your cakehole.
Come on, let's go, on your bike.

941
01:17:24,016 --> 01:17:25,767
Not so fast.

942
01:17:25,935 --> 01:17:29,146
It seems the tables have turned,
Mr. Powers.

943
01:17:29,313 --> 01:17:35,153
- Go ahead, Austin. Don't worry about me.
- Hey, I can take my Sega, right, Dad?

944
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:38,656
It seems the tables have turned again,
Dr. Evil.

945
01:17:38,824 --> 01:17:41,659
Not really. Kill the little bastard,
see what I care.

946
01:17:41,827 --> 01:17:44,162
But Dad, we just had
a breakthrough in group.

947
01:17:44,329 --> 01:17:48,249
I had the group liquidated, you little shit.
They were insolent.

948
01:17:48,751 --> 01:17:50,209
I hate you. I hate you.

949
01:17:50,377 --> 01:17:52,670
I wish I was never
artificially created in a lab.

950
01:17:52,838 --> 01:17:55,965
Oh, Scott, that hurts Daddy
when you say that, honestly.

951
01:17:58,385 --> 01:18:01,012
Number TWo, your timing is impeccable.

952
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:03,139
Go ahead, take Mr. Powers away.

953
01:18:04,141 --> 01:18:05,808
No.

954
01:18:06,226 --> 01:18:07,935
- What?
Dr. Evil...

955
01:18:08,854 --> 01:18:12,815
...I spent 30 years of my life
turning this two-bit evil empire...

956
01:18:12,983 --> 01:18:15,818
...into a world-class multinational.

957
01:18:15,986 --> 01:18:18,946
I was going to have
a cover story in Forbes.

958
01:18:19,114 --> 01:18:22,450
But you, like an idiot,
wanted to take over the world.

959
01:18:22,618 --> 01:18:25,204
And you don't realize
there is no World anymore.

960
01:18:25,371 --> 01:18:26,997
It's only corporations.

961
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:29,583
- Silence, Number Two.
- No.

962
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:32,544
I've had enough of you
pushing me around.

963
01:18:35,757 --> 01:18:40,803
Mr. Powers, I have a business proposition
you might find very interesting.

964
01:18:41,888 --> 01:18:44,348
All right, I've had enough.

965
01:18:48,978 --> 01:18:51,063
Judo chop.

966
01:18:52,941 --> 01:18:55,651
The complex will self-destruct.

967
01:19:01,324 --> 01:19:02,574
Let's split. Let's go.

968
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:07,412
This place is gonna blow.

969
01:19:13,419 --> 01:19:15,963
The complex will self-destruct.

970
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:17,590
Go!

971
01:19:18,175 --> 01:19:20,093
Come on, let's go.

972
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:25,056
The complex will self-destruct.

973
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,101
This Way, Austin.
Come on, baby...

974
01:19:28,269 --> 01:19:29,519
...it's gonna bloW, let's go.

975
01:19:29,687 --> 01:19:32,939
Move it. Alley-oop.

976
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:06,347
Yeah.

977
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:11,061
I love you, Mr. Powers.

978
01:20:11,229 --> 01:20:15,149
And I love you, Mrs. Powers.

979
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:19,153
Oh, that'll be Basil Exposition.

980
01:20:20,238 --> 01:20:24,074
- Oh, ignore it, Austin. Come back to bed.
- Duty calls, baby.

981
01:20:27,454 --> 01:20:29,079
Hello, Austin.

982
01:20:29,247 --> 01:20:32,833
Oh, I... I hope I'm not interrupting
your honeymoon.

983
01:20:33,001 --> 01:20:35,127
No, not at all, Basil.

984
01:20:35,295 --> 01:20:37,671
Did you get that fruit basket I sent you?

985
01:20:37,839 --> 01:20:42,134
Yes, we did, Basil, but you sent too much.
I'm gonna have to send some to my mother.

986
01:20:42,302 --> 01:20:45,387
- Oh, don't forget these.
- Oh, thanks.

987
01:20:45,555 --> 01:20:48,807
- There you go.
- Did you get my other gift?

988
01:20:48,975 --> 01:20:53,395
- We did.
- Yes, Basil, nice rack.

989
01:20:53,563 --> 01:20:56,065
But Who in the world
gave us this drawing?

990
01:20:56,232 --> 01:20:58,108
It's bizarre.

991
01:20:58,276 --> 01:21:01,946
Well, as you know,
Dr. Evil has escaped in his rocket...

992
01:21:02,113 --> 01:21:04,407
...which has disappeared
from our tracking system.

993
01:21:04,575 --> 01:21:06,660
- Oh, dear. Hold on. Coffee?
- Oh, yes, please.

994
01:21:06,827 --> 01:21:08,787
Okay. Thank you.

995
01:21:09,121 --> 01:21:13,458
Oh, and Vanessa, by the way,
you have been made a full agent.

996
01:21:13,626 --> 01:21:15,961
Oh, that's fantastic, Basil. Thanks.

997
01:21:16,128 --> 01:21:18,171
- Milk?
- Yes, please.

998
01:21:18,339 --> 01:21:23,218
Oh, and Austin, her Majesty, the Queen,
informs me that you are to be knighted.

999
01:21:23,386 --> 01:21:25,178
Very shagadelic.

1000
01:21:25,346 --> 01:21:27,555
Well, the best of luck to both of you.

1001
01:21:27,723 --> 01:21:30,725
- Thanks, Basil.
- Goodbye.

1002
01:21:30,893 --> 01:21:35,605
You know, Vanessa,
I'll never forget the first time I saW you.

1003
01:21:35,773 --> 01:21:38,692
You were so incredibly beautiful.

1004
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:42,362
So incredibly sexy.

1005
01:21:42,655 --> 01:21:45,115
I knew I had to have you...

1006
01:21:45,616 --> 01:21:48,034
...right then and there.

1007
01:21:49,495 --> 01:21:52,038
Did you feel the same way?

1008
01:21:52,206 --> 01:21:54,416
Actually, I couldn't stop
staring at your teeth.

1009
01:21:57,713 --> 01:22:00,506
Oh, I ordered some champagne. Come in.

1010
01:22:00,841 --> 01:22:02,174
Oh, lovely, Austin.

1011
01:22:02,342 --> 01:22:04,093
Right over there's fine, thank you.

1012
01:22:04,261 --> 01:22:06,095
Let's go out on the terrace.

1013
01:22:06,263 --> 01:22:08,222
It's a beautiful night,
we can look at the stars.

1014
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:09,557
Smashing idea, baby.

1015
01:22:09,725 --> 01:22:12,143
Yeah, look at you.

1016
01:22:14,354 --> 01:22:16,605
Oh! Look out!

1017
01:22:19,192 --> 01:22:21,736
That really hurt.

1018
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:24,113
I'm gonna have a lump there, you idiot.

1019
01:22:24,656 --> 01:22:28,117
Who throws a shoe? Honestly.

1020
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:30,202
You fight like a woman.

1021
01:22:45,594 --> 01:22:47,094
Austin.

1022
01:22:48,221 --> 01:22:50,765
Honestly, it's not mine.

1023
01:22:50,933 --> 01:22:52,309
No, use it.

1024
01:23:17,668 --> 01:23:20,128
Look how beautiful the night sky is.

1025
01:23:20,296 --> 01:23:22,464
Hey, isn't that the Big Dipper?

1026
01:23:22,632 --> 01:23:25,842
Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus.

1027
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:28,345
- Austin.
- Well, you know.

1028
01:23:28,513 --> 01:23:32,849
- Hey, I've never seen that big star before.
- Yeah, what is that?

1029
01:23:35,144 --> 01:23:37,062
Good God.

1030
01:23:41,734 --> 01:23:44,987
I'm gonna get you, Austin Powers.

1031
01:23:45,155 --> 01:23:48,699

Can you change her? Is that okay? All right?

Very good. Very good.

And right here.
Right here, looking right there.

Looking right... I'm not even looking.

Oh, you're wicked. You got your mojo
working overtime, darling. Yeah.

1042
01:24:53,808 --> 01:24:56,101
Look, I'm not even shooting you,

Smashing. Beautiful.
Come on, can I get a smile?

Okay, good. Loving it.
Let's make a Vanessa sandwich.

You're wearing horns, you're wearing horns.
Come on, Austin, give it to me. Go. Go...
