1
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,639
Hey, hey, Tuck, dude.

2
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,039
- Okay, we're rolling.
- Okay, hold on.

3
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,839
B-Before you go,
look-look at my coat.

4
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,279
- It's cool, huh?
- What is that?

5
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,279
Can we do another take
with it on, though?

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,679
No.

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,839
Okay.

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,719
Ready when you are.

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,959
Okay. How do I smell?

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,239
Or I mean, look, or you know?
Yeah, you can't smell a video.

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,439
Okay.

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,199
Ruckus, dude, you got
to get out of here.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,719
Hi, I'm Reginald.

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,919
I don't really get friends much,

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,559
but it's probably
because I'm a bit of...

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,839
an acquired taste.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,279
That's what my mom says.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,679
And I'm sure whatever
school I'm forced to go to

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,999
no one will acquire it.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,399
So...

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,359
thanks for paving
a road over, really,

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,581
the only place I've ever
had any real friends.

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,959
Okay, we good?

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,199
- Uh, say your name.
- I thought you knew my name.

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,599
You know what I mean; for the video.

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,879
Dude, we've been
hanging out for years.

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,599
- Come on.
- Dude, stop fronting. Just tell the camera.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,879
You're upset, right?

29
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,109
You don't want to move.

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,879
I've never gone a day

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,144
without seeing my friends.

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,025
They're, like, the only people
in the world who get me.

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,479
And now it's just all over, you know?

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,062
Good luck finding that again.

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,591
So wherever-wherever
Munch is going, man...

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,342
Look, you people listen
to me, all right?

37
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,869
He's-he's a really good kid.

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,959
So don't just assume

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,622
that he's weird and that's it.

40
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,719
And Alex,

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,460
man...

42
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,666
He's a foster kid.

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,071
He's been moved all over.

44
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,639
I mean, it's like, why do you have
to build a freeway right through?

45
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,268
You know, can't you just
go around or something?

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,399
You're going along

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,999
feeling like

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,279
your own person

49
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,919
with your own friends,

50
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,990
and then something
like this comes along...

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,228
that you have no power to stop...

52
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,871
because you're just a kid.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,025
You're just a kid.

54
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,399
Yeah, hey, man.

55
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,919
Yeah, yeah, I'm up, I'm up.

56
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,319
Whoa, whoa, man, slow down.

57
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,479
What's the problem?

58
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,559
Yeah, my-my phone's good. Why?

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,266
What happened?

60
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,599
Wait, what?

61
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,359
This is when everything

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,519
started to change.

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,319
So, being me,

64
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,663
I kept filming.

65
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,719
I'm Tuck.

66
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,079
What you're about to
see happened to me

67
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,026
and my best friends one year ago.

68
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,630
This is the story of our
last week together.

69
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,439
Phones all over

70
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,679
our neighborhood are freaking out.

71
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,319
We've done everything we could
possibly do with this phone.

72
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,879
We threw it at the wall,

73
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,519
we took it to the phone guy,

74
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,759
we took it to the store
where we got it from,

75
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,279
and they say it's a problem.

76
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,519
So you know it's serious.

77
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,839
It looks like your phone
basically barfed on the screen.

78
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,359
- What happened?
- I don't know.

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,359
I was just eating dinner,
and all of a sudden,

80
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,399
all the phones in the
house just did this.

81
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,519
At exactly the same time.

82
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,719
Dude.

83
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,119
What? It's freaky.

84
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,159
- De hello?
- Hey, Alex.

85
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,759
Oh, Munch, you're outside.

86
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,679
Get over here, over here,
down the street.

87
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,479
Ask him if his phone barfed yet.

88
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,799
Did your phone barf yet?

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,559
- Phones are still working.
- Cool.

90
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,399
Keep going, and we'll
meet you in the backyard.

91
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,982
Okay, copy that.
I'll take swift steps.

92
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,159
When I look back at that day,

93
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,639
I realize the clues
were all around us.

94
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,381
We had no idea.

95
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,879
Dude, they all still work.

96
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,348
See?

97
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,319
Dude, you know if this
whole thing works,

98
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,759
- these phones are done.
- No, I know.

99
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,159
I have 14 spares; it's okay.

100
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,599
- I bet you do.
- Okay.

101
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,839
All right, anyways, let's spread out.

102
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,279
- Okay.
- Alex, go by the gate.

103
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,479
Munch, go on the far end,

104
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,639
- Yeah, I got it.
- And I'll stay right here by my camera.

105
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,108
- Just watch out!
- Okay, okay.

106
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,349
Okay, it's good.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,865
It's good...

108
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,879
It's good...

109
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,199
Whoa, okay, it went out.

110
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,399
Whoa, whoa, it barfed!

111
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,719
All right, people,
if you go to Alex's house,

112
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,599
your phones will spew
chunks all over his screen.

113
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,519
My mom said the Murphys' phones
and the Churleys' changed, too.

114
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,101
So what do you think this is?

115
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,191
Whoa!

116
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,390
These dudes.

117
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,759
Hi.

118
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,839
- Is that on?
- I don't know.

119
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,759
- Maybe.
- Oh.

120
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,039
We had an electrical
short over at the site,

121
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,399
and it may be disrupting
people's phone service,

122
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,999
and we're wondering if that happened

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,999
- to anybody in this house?
- Oh, no, my phone is good.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,919
- 'Cause we're offering new phone vouchers
- Uh-huh.

125
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,839
in exchange for any
device in this area here

126
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,519
- that may be displaying
- That's weird, that's weird.

127
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,679
- Faulty messages or images?
- I don't know. See you.

128
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,181
No, listen, I...

129
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,519
Okay, so you-you really don't think

130
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,079
this is a little bit weird?

131
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,879
These dudes come here
to build a freeway

132
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,159
- and now they want our phones?
- Well, I think it's gonna work.

133
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,799
No. Clean your room.

134
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,039
Oh, my... I'm not gonna have
a room if we don't do something.

135
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,679
- Right, I think...
- No, Mom, seriously.

136
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,599
These guys want our houses.

137
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,999
Maybe if we expose them
for illegal property, then...

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,679
- Yo!
- Aw, you don't like how things are, do you?

139
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,591
What are you gonna do about it, huh?

140
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,159
Dude, it's a map to the desert.

141
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,239
Like, what is that?
What do we do with this?

142
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,999
I guess most maps are
made to be followed.

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,639
Exactly. It could go to, like,

144
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,839
some crazy headquarters,
and we find out

145
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,439
that these construction
clowns are spies

146
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,879
and we expose them to the world.

147
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,039
It's 20 miles away. What...

148
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,279
No, we're not... we're not gonna go.

149
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,679
No, obviously not.

150
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,319
Look, whatever it is,

151
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,039
this Saturday, we're going to sneak

152
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,079
behind our parents'
backs and find out.

153
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,999
I'm moving Saturday.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,039
All right, all right,
so Friday night.

155
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,559
Our last night together?

156
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,359
It doesn't have to be;
that's what I'm saying.

157
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,759
Like, I don't want to move,

158
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,479
and these clowns are making us do it.

159
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,839
Maybe we can stop them.

160
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,919
Now, are you in?

161
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,439
Yeah, all right.

162
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,199
- A ll right.
- I'm in.

163
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,119
Munch, don't you bail out on us now.

164
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,439
Dude, I'm not. Me?

165
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,719
No... pfft! I'm in.

166
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,839
Yeah! All right!
That's what I'm talking about,

167
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,239
that's what I'm talking
about, all right.

168
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,159
Bring it in.

169
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,503
- Oh, oops!
- Munch!

170
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,439
So, why would you be
organizing your ketchups?

171
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,639
- Because.
- Who does that?

172
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,719
So I can get to them easier,
and then it's more organized,

173
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,999
- and it's better.
- And you are my friend.

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,559
Guys, guys, it's time
to practice the big lie.

175
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,359
Hey, Mom, I'm spending
the night at Alex's house

176
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,228
so we can play a neat,
brand-new video game.

177
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,319
And I'm sleeping over at Tuck's house

178
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,039
so we can play a new video game.

179
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,399
And I'm sleeping in your mom's bed,

180
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,199
- not playing a video game.
- Oh, my God, all right, dude.

181
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,999
Stop talking about my
mother, thank you.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,959
All right, the camera's
are gonna be on

183
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,839
24 hours a day, nonstop.

184
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,719
Dude, can you stop touching, please?

185
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,559
It attaches to my bike,
and it's also a pretty good way

186
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,719
to get footage on the fly.

187
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,879
Spy glasses.

188
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,039
I love these; I love them.

189
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,319
And last, camera,
but definitely not least...

190
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,039
What up, camcorder?

191
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,159
Keeping it tight.
Looking pretty good these days.

192
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,599
Tuck, these are the ugliest
things I've ever seen.

193
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,919
Dude, what? What are you...
what are you talking about?

194
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,359
Those are... They're sweet.

195
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,759
- The camera's undetectable,
- Wow.

196
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,519
- And the ladies love them.
- Prove it.

197
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,799
Prove it?

198
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,839
This guy, all right?
Give me my glasses, man.

199
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,919
Those are stealth.

200
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,079
Now I'm gonna prove to you guys

201
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,741
spy glasses get you girls.

202
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,439
Oh, my gosh, he's going over there.

203
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,480
- I can't see who he's talking to.
- Shut up, Munch.

204
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,479
Uh, hi, uh...

205
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,079
Hey, um, Em-Emma, right?

206
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,599
Emma?

207
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,519
I was just...

208
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,625
Okay, uh, can I borrow a
piece of paper, please?

209
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,319
He has something.

210
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,279
- I can't see who he got it from.
- We're about to see right now.

211
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,519
Look, look, look, look.

212
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,465
He has a paper.

213
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,159
You did not get her number.

214
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,519
Totally got her number. Right there.

215
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,839
You doubted me,
and my spy glasses worked.

216
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,319
You, too, you're a sellout.

217
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,199
No, uh-uh, you didn't
get Emma's number.

218
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,799
Yes, I did.

219
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,039
Mannequin Girl?

220
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,919
What kind of name is that?

221
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,865
What? That's what I call her.

222
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,199
I think mannequins are hot.

223
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,439
I'll leave my house at 6:00.

224
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,839
15 minutes later, I pick up Alex.

225
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,639
- Munch, we'll get you at 6:30.
- Yeah.

226
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,799
Okay? Tonight, we're no longer boys.

227
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,679
We're men.

228
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,559
- Dude, what the...?
- I didn't see you, man.

229
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,519
Tuck, you all right? Let's go.

230
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,799
Our whole lives

231
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,119
we've been nobodies.

232
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,279
In visible.

233
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,519
The good kids.

234
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,022
Not anymore.

235
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,839
All right, Ma.

236
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,039
I'm leaving.

237
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,399
Spending the night at Alex's house

238
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,199
so we can play a new video game.

239
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,039
Have whatever you want, honey.

240
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,759
You know what, I lied, actually.

241
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,999
We're gonna ride our
bikes out into the desert

242
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,159
at night alone.

243
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,119
Without supervision.

244
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,279
We got that; we're going to state.

245
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,079
Okay, see you then, sweetie.

246
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,359
- We could go.
- Also rob a bank.

247
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,599
- All the way. State.
- What?

248
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,879
Go to Mexico.
Maybe even start a new life.

249
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,319
- Right, I know.
- Wrestling!

250
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,919
You're trying to act
like I don't know

251
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,199
what I'm talking about.

252
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,959
What's up, Stumpy?

253
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,225
Yo, man, I told you to
stop to calling me that.

254
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,719
You know what, man, look,

255
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,479
my girl's throwing this
huge party later tonight,

256
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,079
if you want to come by.

257
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,506
You serious?

258
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,319
Yes, I'm serious.

259
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,479
Because not a lady in
the world can resist

260
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,439
a natty old BMX bike.

261
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,399
What's the zero to 60
on that bad boy, huh?

262
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,141
Two, three days?

263
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,799
Come on, come on, dude, you ready?

264
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,586
Let's go.

265
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,759
I can't even tell a difference.

266
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,639
This looks exactly the way
it looked before you packed.

267
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,959
All your stuff fitting in one box?

268
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,239
What are you, a drifter?

269
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,399
Who told you?

270
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,959
Look, all I'm saying is,

271
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,039
when you get to your
new house, put a poster up,

272
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,599
put some shelves on the
wall, frame a photo.

273
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,759
Look, there's a painting right there.

274
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,959
Put something on a shelf...

275
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,199
That's not a painting.

276
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,519
That looks like somebody just took

277
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,279
a bunch of dirt, smudged
it and called it art.

278
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,319
I'm going to Munch's house to
play a video game, all right?

279
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,479
- Okay.
- Yeah, sure, buddy.

280
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,879
- Bye, Dylan.
- Have fun with your friends.

281
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,519
- Hey, hey, Tuck.
- How are you?

282
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,279
Uh, good luck with the
move to New York, buddy.

283
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,959
- Maybe we'll come see you.
- All right, cool.

284
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,319
The moving truck is coming at 10:00.

285
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,319
Make sure you're back, okay?

286
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,599
I-I don't get it.

287
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,199
If your foster parents already
have a baby of their own,

288
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,399
why do they need you?

289
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,799
There's no sense in
having two babies.

290
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,919
- Shut up, dude.
- One baby cries all the time,

291
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,199
the other one listens to indie rock.

292
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,399
Let's go.

293
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,919
Yeow!

294
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,679
Guys, would you please help my son

295
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,279
with his room, before I go crazy?

296
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,879
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- I don't think he's started...

297
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,479
Honey, have you even
started packing your room?

298
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,799
I told you a thousand times,

299
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,199
I'm alphabetizing!

300
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,759
Yo, let's scare him, let's scare him.

301
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,959
Shh.

302
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,359
...they're flexible,
they're "dynamical,"

303
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,959
they can be curved, they can bend,

304
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,239
and this opens up a
whole new universe

305
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,399
of possibilities, and one
of the possibilities

306
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,319
is that there can be shortcuts
through space and through time.

307
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,759
So that's really just
what a Wormhole is.

308
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,919
It's taking advantage...

309
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,879
What are you... Aah!

310
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,599
- Why don't you stop doing that?!
- I'm sorry!

311
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,759
You guys are gonna give me
a heart attack one day.

312
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,239
- I'm sorry.
- Turn that off, dude.

313
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,879
I created a substation

314
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,119
for each of our parents' phones
that's wired to the router,

315
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,279
which is wired to the transmitter,

316
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,119
which transmits to the
receiver, which is...

317
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,119
- my phone.
- Okay, so basically,

318
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,519
no matter who our parents
call, it goes to your phone.

319
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,439
Yeah. My mom's friends always say

320
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,919
that I sound just like
my mom, you know,

321
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,319
- when I pick up the phone...
- Yeah.

322
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,585
So I figured, I can be Betty.

323
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,439
Bye, Betty. Thank you.

324
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,639
Um, I'm going to Alex's...
or Munch's... or Tuck's house,

325
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,679
and we're gonna play a
video game and sleep over.

326
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,199
Wait, what's all that stuff?

327
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,270
Honey?

328
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,079
Good job, Munch. You did it.

329
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,439
Here we come.

330
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,319
17.6 miles.

331
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,239
<i>Going to the desert...</i>

332
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,479
Munch, what are you doing?

333
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,279
Guys, guys, just hold on,
hold on, hold on.

334
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,919
- Dude...
- I'm not backing out or anything,

335
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,479
- He wants to quit right when we
- ...just-just hear me out.

336
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,999
- Been waiting for this forever.
- Dude, listen, come on, okay.

337
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,759
This is crazy what we're doing.

338
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,239
Dude, I don't want to punk out

339
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,359
or back out or anything...

340
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,519
it's just, my mom, you know,
she just got divorced.

341
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,759
- Munch...
- She's already had

342
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,039
enough guys lying to her.

343
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,079
If you didn't want to come,
then why didn't you tell us earlier?

344
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,799
You do understand this is
our last night together.

345
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,519
Yeah, I know, I know.

346
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,879
Look, Munch, if we don't
go now, we'll never go.

347
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,639
We won't even be here.

348
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,439
This is our last chance
to try and do something.

349
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,839
Even-even if it is stupid.

350
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,039
- Yeah.
- You know what,

351
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,399
I say we put a vote to it.

352
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,470
All in favor raise your hand.

353
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,439
Well, now I have to raise my hand.

354
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,399
Munch, just...

355
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,959
Fine, fine.

356
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,839
Okay, whatever.

357
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,039
I'll go.

358
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,383
But only under one condition.

359
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,228
- I call the black!
- Mine! No, no, give it!

360
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,519
It's so weird, no one's gonna be

361
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,146
in these houses next week.

362
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,799
Dude, you're so full of it.

363
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,679
- When did you kiss her?
- Dude, trust me.

364
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,879
After pre-algebra,
she pulled me into the bathroom.

365
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,679
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
Mannequin Girl?

366
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,319
- Yeah!
- Was she good at it?

367
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,839
Uh, eh, B minus.

368
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,999
You know, I've kissed
better in better locations.

369
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,879
No, how do I know you're not lying?

370
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,679
Trust me. I don't even
have to reply to you.

371
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,279
- You're last!
- Hey, you got a head start!

372
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,827
That's not fair!

373
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,679
Oh, so what, there's a Wing Stop?

374
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,199
I never been to a Wing Stop.

375
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,039
We followed a map

376
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,159
out in the middle of nowhere.

377
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,345
It might be, like, a CIA prison.

378
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,959
We were miles from home.

379
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,589
No one in the world knew it.

380
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,599
No one said it...

381
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,864
but we were scared.

382
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,199
We haven't seen a car
in, like, half an hour.

383
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,702
We were on our own.

384
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,623
This-this is the way, right?

385
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,119
You have the map, right?

386
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,519
- Can I see the map?
- Left.

387
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,959
Left? Are you sure?

388
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,239
Because right looks a
little bit more promising.

389
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,391
Did you guys hear that?

390
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,229
Just a couple more miles.

391
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,629
Hold on. What is that?

392
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,199
It's the map.

393
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,464
Are we close?

394
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,759
I never understood why
people like the outdoors.

395
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,999
Will you stop freaking out?

396
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,749
Yo, this is too steep, man.

397
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,624
Let's go, man.

398
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,279
We're getting pretty far
from the road, guys.

399
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,861
Almost there.

400
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,959
Is it this thing?

401
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,359
I don't think so.

402
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,799
Wait, what was that?

403
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,959
- I don't know.
- Well, hold on.

404
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,144
What'd you see, dude?

405
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,879
Over here!

406
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,199
We're almost there. Come on.

407
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,959
Oh.

408
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,269
What?

409
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,319
What do you think it is?

410
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,821
How would I know?

411
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,868
Why does it look all burnt?

412
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,439
Hey, just be careful.

413
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,181
- Careful!
- Yeah, don't touch that thing. Could be...

414
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,719
C-Could be...

415
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,719
I don't know, I don't know.

416
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,301
A part of a satellite?

417
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,439
All right, all right, um,
Munch, film me while I'm...

418
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,759
- while I'm touching this thing.
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

419
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,945
Let me try it. Thank you.

420
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,469
It's dusty.

421
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,750
It's a piece of crap.

422
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,119
What?

423
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,319
Forget about it.

424
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,999
Just turn off the camera.

425
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,999
Well, it's not a national treasure,

426
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,519
but it could be used for something.

427
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,079
It's crap.

428
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,639
What happened to filming
'cause it's our last night, huh?

429
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,479
Um, in case you haven't
noticed, obviously,

430
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,479
the map led to squat.

431
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,199
Got it. So all you cared about

432
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,359
was getting your stupid
hits on your stupid video?

433
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,319
- Dude, why don't you just...
- Whoa, guys, guys, guys.

434
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,759
Come on! I know
we're all frustrated...

435
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,759
It's Alex's mom.

436
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,719
- Are you serious?
- Um, it'll be fine.

437
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,319
Just, um, be Betty, okay?

438
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,879
- Oh, man.
- Oh, crap.

439
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,999
Yo, I thought I could
do this, but I can't.

440
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,199
Maybe you can answer it.

441
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,639
She just likes to check
up on things, okay?

442
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,519
All right.

443
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,719
Betty, are you there?

444
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,879
Go.

445
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,879
This is Betty.

446
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,999
I was thinking maybe
I could bring over

447
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,279
some pizzas?

448
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,719
Dude, go.

449
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,879
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no. No coming over.

450
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,079
- Just hang up.
- No way.

451
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,639
No, it's really no trouble.
We have a coupon.

452
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,879
- I said no! No pizzas!
- What?

453
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,719
- No, uh...
- Don't yell at her, man.

454
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,599
Maybe you and your
husband should go to bed.

455
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,799
Stop saying words!

456
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,559
Are you sure everything's okay?

457
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,999
Have a good night. Go to sleep.

458
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,559
That could've gone better.

459
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,319
That was horrible.

460
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,679
"Your husband should go to sleep"?

461
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,679
Was that really
something smart to say?

462
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,545
Munch.

463
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,079
Don't look at me like I'm a hoarder.

464
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,519
That's rude.

465
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,839
Who are they?

466
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,039
I don't... I don't know.

467
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,199
I'm picking up some
spikes in the readings...

468
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,359
Get down, get down.

469
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,191
Turn your flashlight off, dummy.

470
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,079
Let's go.

471
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,839
Why would they be out this far?

472
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,999
Who cares?

473
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,501
The night's blown.

474
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,919
- Aah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.

475
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,679
Munch?

476
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,959
- You're a character.
- There's something in there!

477
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,119
What?

478
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,319
Dude, are you kidding me right now?

479
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,479
Something is in that bag.

480
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,981
It-it touched me.

481
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,959
Go check.

482
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,428
Be-be careful.

483
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,879
- What?
- Did it poke you, too?

484
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,679
What, dude? Say something!

485
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,319
What did you see?

486
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,319
There-There's something in there.

487
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,039
Yeah, a bunch of crap Munch brought.

488
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,879
- You guys are funny.
- All I know is it beeped.

489
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,319
You know, why don't you
go in there and just see.

490
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,159
Beeped? What are you talking about?

491
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,741
Babies. I'll do it myself.

492
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,546
Dang, how much stuff do you
have in your bag, dude?

493
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,826
Geez.

494
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,439
Oh, boy, are you guys
talking about this?

495
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,239
It's garbage. It's nothing.

496
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,639
What are you talking about,
you heard something?

497
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,879
It made a noise.

498
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,109
Hey, hey, do something!

499
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,039
See, it's not doing anything.

500
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,559
What are you talking about?

501
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,759
Beep.

502
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,759
Do that again, do that again.

503
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,079
Do what again?

504
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,279
Do what you just did.

505
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,999
Beep.

506
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,239
Whoa, hold on. Let me...

507
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,399
Let me try this for myself.

508
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,919
Beep.

509
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,159
Beep?

510
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,879
Why is it making noise
only for you and not me?

511
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,666
Make it beep again.

512
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,679
Beep.

513
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,839
Whoa!

514
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,399
This is it! It's a bomb!

515
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,519
No, no, oh, God, no!

516
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,919
No, no, no!

517
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,799
Guys, I think... I think
it might have defused.

518
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,959
I don't know.

519
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,479
Man, nothing's happening.

520
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,839
All right, hold on, hold on.

521
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,387
I got an idea.

522
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,719
Tuck!

523
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,799
What?

524
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,399
Okay, it didn't do anything,

525
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,239
but j-just don't do it again.

526
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,119
Are you insane, Tuck?!

527
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,359
Are you sure you guys
know what you're doing?

528
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,039
Yes, trust me.

529
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,199
When it's a bomb,
you have to act quick.

530
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,279
I seen it on some TV show
or some movie or something.

531
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,782
- Saw what?
- Check it out.

532
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,919
What are you doing?!

533
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,239
Disarming it.

534
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,479
Are you crazy?!

535
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,159
It's a bomb; that's what
you're supposed to do.

536
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,999
That's not what you do with a bomb!

537
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,279
Are you insane?!

538
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,439
What was that?

539
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,119
It's not my phone.

540
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,599
It's the thing, whatever that is.

541
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,159
- What are you talking about?
- It's that.

542
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,599
That's what just made that noise.

543
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,227
I, uh... It, like,
imitated my ringtone.

544
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,999
This is what made our phones barf?

545
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,599
Did you hear that?

546
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,759
All right, so, a couple
of seconds ago,

547
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,319
our phones went crazy.

548
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,759
Bananas, insane.

549
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,919
I don't know what to call it. Look.

550
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,279
You see that?

551
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,679
It's a new map,
but on my phone this time.

552
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,039
To me? All right, him, or...

553
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,799
Dude, Munch's phone got
all weird hieroglyphics

554
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,119
and, ugh, I don't even
know what that is.

555
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,359
Alex's phone, it just
turned on by itself

556
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,919
and started filming.
We can't even turn them off.

557
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,159
Oh, don't try to act
like it's not cool.

558
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,319
That is weird.

559
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,039
It's showing us where we are.

560
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,519
And you don't find that creepy?

561
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,759
What do you think that is?
You think that's a road?

562
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,079
We should follow the map.

563
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,319
How about no.

564
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,719
How about yes?

565
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,159
We wanted a last night together,

566
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,319
so what do you call this?

567
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,821
A trap?

568
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,959
Didn't you guys see the
"No Trespassing" sign?

569
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,827
Oops. I didn't see anything.

570
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,319
This is where the map says to go.

571
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,079
Stop stepping on leaves.

572
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,279
There's leaves everywhere.

573
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,102
Shh.

574
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,151
What was that?

575
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,999
Where do you think it's taking us to?

576
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,421
Maybe another one of
those beepy things.

577
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,719
What was that?

578
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,631
I don't know.

579
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,679
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Get down!

580
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,591
Oh, geez!

581
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,759
Munch, watch out!

582
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,199
Aah! Aah!

583
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,199
Aah!

584
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,639
What's going on?

585
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,039
Dude, Munch, what was that?

586
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,839
Where is it?

587
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,159
Is it over?

588
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,519
Oh, geez.

589
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,319
Dude!

590
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,199
Tuck, stay back.

591
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,039
- Whoa.
- Stay back.

592
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,239
What's...

593
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,919
Dude!

594
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,919
Wait, wait, be careful.

595
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,799
Your phone just got a new map.

596
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,959
What?

597
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,039
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Wait, why is it opening?

598
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,999
Hold on, hold on.
Did you see that just now?

599
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,799
What is that?

600
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,319
- Whoa! What is that?
- What is that?

601
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,679
- What is that?
- Oh, my...

602
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,599
Dude, move, you're blocking my shot.

603
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,879
It-it's moving.

604
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,279
There's something in there right now.

605
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,439
What's in there?

606
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,599
Oh, don't tell me.

607
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,799
Are those... eyes?

608
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,239
Dude, dude, it's looking
dead at us right now.

609
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,679
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

610
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,999
It's trembling like it's hurt.

611
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,740
Good.

612
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,751
My heart's beating so fast right now.

613
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,439
Wow.

614
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,919
Almost got us killed, like,
three times already.

615
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,599
Yeah, but it was worth it, dude.

616
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,159
Incredible.

617
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,159
All right, so...

618
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,719
I just figured out why Alex's
camera was on this whole time.

619
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,759
So this thing, whatever it is,

620
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,959
it's eyes are, like,
all screwed up, completely.

621
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,399
You see?

622
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,479
So, basically, it uses
his phone to see.

623
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,079
That's insane.

624
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,239
You think he can see us right now?

625
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,159
Munch, you have to check this out.

626
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,359
This is amazing.

627
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,159
Is it?

628
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,639
Is it amazing?

629
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,479
'Cause I think it's scary as balls.

630
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,479
I mean, obviously people
are looking for it.

631
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,079
- Munch...
- It has access to our voicemails

632
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,799
and our texts and our ringtones.

633
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,159
How do you even know it's a he?

634
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,519
Are you a dude?

635
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,359
Wait...

636
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,919
you understood us.

637
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,959
Whoa.

638
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,479
All right, here's how it goes.

639
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,359
One beep is yes, two beeps are no.

640
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,119
Watch.

641
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,959
Is one beep yes?

642
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,479
Yo, that's so tight.

643
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,639
Are we in a barn?

644
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,719
Is Munch really a woman?

645
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,559
Oh, come on, man,
this thing is broken.

646
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,799
Everybody knows Munch is a woman.

647
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,199
Okay, I have a question.

648
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,464
Are we gonna die tonight?

649
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,319
Why isn't it answering?

650
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,946
What...

651
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,708
Well, that's not good, right?

652
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,839
20 questions with an alien.

653
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,119
Tuck Simms exclusive.

654
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,479
- Let's do this.
- Check it out.

655
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,799
All right, um, are you from space?

656
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,079
Ooh!

657
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,319
Are you a robot?

658
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,799
Do you eat humans?

659
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,519
Do you like Earth?

660
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,910
Why? Why doesn't he like Earth?

661
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,999
Do you like us?

662
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,719
You see? I told you.

663
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,999
We're cool like that.

664
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,199
Come on.

665
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,399
Are you hurt?

666
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,279
- Oh.
- He's hurt.

667
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,719
Well, his lights seem brighter, so...

668
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,439
Did that piece help you?

669
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,466
Oh.

670
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,079
Can we help fix you or something?

671
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,639
Or... Like, what is this?

672
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,159
Are-are you trying
to build something?

673
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,079
Oh, he's trying to build...

674
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,319
Building something. Right there.

675
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,359
- What could he be building?
- Yeah.

676
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,039
So, wait, what are,
what are you building?

677
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,519
Lasers?

678
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,799
A portal?

679
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,159
Minions?

680
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,999
A cloaking device?

681
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,679
It's an army.

682
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,959
Ignore him.

683
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,919
Spaceship?

684
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,279
Oh, my God!

685
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,319
Hold up, hold up.
So let me get this right.

686
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,839
So you're building a spaceship,

687
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,079
- He's building a spaceship.
- And you need our help

688
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,519
building the spaceship?

689
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,319
Oh, man.

690
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,639
This guy is building a spaceship.

691
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,879
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

692
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,479
Let me make sure I
don't have any plans.

693
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,519
Nope! We're building a spaceship!

694
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,319
He's building a spaceship.

695
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,639
We asked him questions

696
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,790
for almost two hours.

697
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,550
Where he came from.

698
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,227
If there were others here like him.

699
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,199
We found out he was lost...

700
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,039
and alone.

701
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,639
He was out in the middle of nowhere,

702
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,039
on his own,

703
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,871
like us.

704
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,079
All we really knew
was that he crashed,

705
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,311
and now he needed us to rebuild him.

706
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,239
The map says up ahead.

707
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,839
Are we going the right way?

708
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,439
Look, look, look, look,
whatever that is,

709
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,669
the map goes to it.

710
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,399
All right, so wait-wait a minute.

711
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,199
Let me get this right.

712
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,799
Dude comes from a million
light-years away,

713
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,479
and he wants to come here?

714
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,799
I don't know, the map said so.

715
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,119
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

716
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,679
You got to look both ways
before you cross the street.

717
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,039
Munch.

718
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,783
So are you... snoopy.

719
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,119
Ten dollars?

720
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,519
- I said no deal.
- $7.50.

721
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,279
I don't want it.
It's tchotchke trash.

722
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,279
If you give it to me as a gift,
I'd still throw it away.

723
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,079
- It's trash.
- No, it's vintage.

724
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,719
No. You don't get to say
the word "vintage."

725
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,039
I'm the one who gets to
say when what is vintage.

726
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,919
Excuse me, sir, you have
a very, very lovely shop.

727
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,399
Come on, you sure?

728
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,759
Hey.

729
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,399
Oh, man, look at the hand painting.

730
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,199
It's all crafted right there.

731
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,319
- One of a kind.
- It's trash.

732
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,101
Uh, uh...

733
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,149
What was that?

734
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,426
F-sharp?

735
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,839
No, no, no! Come on!

736
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,319
Watch out! Watch out!

737
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,159
What was it?

738
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,039
Whoa. Is everybody okay?

739
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,599
Hey, Nichols, are you alive?

740
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,759
They broke my girlfriend's lamp!

741
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,759
Wait, what is he doing?

742
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,719
- Oh. Whoa, whoa.
- Is-is that...

743
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,599
Sweet babushka.

744
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,119
You want to sell it?

745
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,319
- Tuck, let's go! Come on!
- Run! What are you waiting for?

746
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,959
Dude, that place was wrecked!

747
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,199
Sorry again, sir!

748
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,039
Go! Go! Down here!

749
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,544
Let's get somewhere
so we can look at him.

750
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,919
He's shaking.

751
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,039
Whoa, he's letting you touch him.

752
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,639
- I wouldn't, guys.
- Hey, what about here?

753
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,959
Here, set him on here.

754
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,079
He looks scared.

755
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,879
Yeah, why is he all balled up?

756
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,559
Can't you stand?

757
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,039
You all right?

758
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,319
Maybe he's...

759
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,479
maybe he's just shy.

760
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,079
- Ooh, can you fly?
- Can you do X-ray vision?

761
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,919
How? He can't see.

762
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,919
He doesn't even know where to look.

763
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,559
All right, all right,
I think the question is,

764
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,959
what can you do?

765
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,239
Okay, so Dr. Nichols is
doing a surgical procedure

766
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,999
with very sophisticated technology.

767
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,279
Pen caps.

768
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,239
Clear.

769
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,719
Wait, I don't get it.
How is that sophisticated?

770
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,479
It's kind of just, like, pen caps.

771
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,679
I got it.

772
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,439
Be careful. His legs are fragile.

773
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,319
Get this. Are you getting this?

774
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,559
Oh, that's crazy!

775
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,039
So you can't fly,

776
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,781
but you can float.

777
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,439
That is so crazy!

778
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,119
I saw you. I saw you grinning, man.

779
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,319
Stop trying to pretend
like that wasn't cool.

780
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,959
- That was hot.
- This is crazy.

781
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,428
I mean, it's-it's just crazy.

782
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,359
Whoa. Don't drop it.

783
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,100
Huh.

784
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,519
Can you see me?

785
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,319
Huh, I think he likes you.

786
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,759
Will you show us where you live?

787
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,679
All right.

788
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,439
Beep faster if I'm getting close.

789
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,559
Is that it, right there?

790
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,141
Why don't I go first.

791
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,559
Hi. Um, my name's Alex, and...

792
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,519
you're-you're in... Munch, no...

793
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,799
you're in my hand right now.

794
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,319
You know my ringtone, which is,
like, insane and awesome.

795
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,239
Okay, um...

796
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,879
Hi.

797
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,119
I'm Tuck.

798
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,279
What's up?

799
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,759
I don't even know what
to say, but, uh...

800
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,319
but, uh, I'm from...
I'm from New York.

801
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,199
Uh, this is Nevada.

802
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,479
I don't even know,
like, I like donuts,

803
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,959
- um...
- Donuts? Really?

804
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,119
Okay, can somebody else do this?

805
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,879
I know, I'm going. My name's M...

806
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,639
My real name is Reginald,
but my friends call me Munch.

807
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,199
I hope we can be friends, too.

808
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,159
Do you have a name?

809
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,479
Oh, we could call him Beep.

810
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,319
Dude, what-what kind of name is Beep?

811
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,679
Word. We got to give him a
name that's powerful, like...

812
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,479
like Master Blaster.

813
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,879
He doesn't blast anything.

814
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,439
Peter. Peter. What about Peter?

815
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,799
Something cool, like Space
Ninja or something.

816
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,319
Well, how is there a ninja in space?

817
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,519
He wouldn't be able to breathe.

818
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,679
- All right, all right...
- Dude, you don't know that.

819
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,839
Have you ever been to space?

820
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,639
Which name do you like?

821
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,159
Uh, Beep. Why?

822
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,359
There it is.

823
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,559
- Hello. Watch this. Watch this.
- You can't echo...

824
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,799
Watch this. Just...

825
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,999
Beep.

826
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,199
See?

827
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,359
Echo.

828
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,319
That's what we should call it. Echo.

829
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,239
- Oh, 'cause it echoes.
- Wait, I don't get it.

830
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,559
- Echo, Echo, Echo.
- Echo.

831
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,279
Your name...

832
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,999
is Echo.

833
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,759
Echo... Echo...

834
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,679
I don't think he's supposed

835
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,319
to come out of that cylinder thing.

836
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,999
He looks... dead.

837
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,581
Echo?

838
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,879
So then we didn't know
how broken he was.

839
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,626
The crash hurt him
worse than we thought.

840
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,879
Okay, little guy...

841
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,519
where do you want us to go?

842
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,599
Guys?

843
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,910
You know this is considered
being a burglar, right?

844
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,239
With each new piece,

845
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,919
he got strong.

846
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,981
And that's what we were
gonna do... make him stronger.

847
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,759
- Which way?
- Around.

848
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,119
- In the house?!
- Dude!

849
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,559
Maybe we should just
knock on the door and...

850
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,559
We just need you to
listen, sweetheart.

851
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,839
- Oh, man.
- You're grounding me?

852
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,959
Tuck, what are you doing? Munch, go.

853
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,399
It's the man... the man should
choose his dance partner.

854
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,719
It's a stupid tradition.

855
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,399
Really, it's about
meeting new people,

856
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,199
and many of those were
our friends' sons.

857
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,119
And it's embarrassing
when you ignore them.

858
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,759
And these are life skills
that we are teaching you.

859
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,999
- Tuck, get back.
- Putting on this dress for you

860
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,719
doesn't change me into some
perfect little homecoming queen!

861
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,039
Okay, no one's asking you to
act like a homecoming queen.

862
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,599
It's at least three years away.

863
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,799
Now. Go, go, go.

864
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,119
...by the company you keep.

865
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,919
It's a cliché for a reason.
I'm sure this all seems...

866
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,359
Guys, what are we doing?
We're gonna be trapped up here.

867
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,959
Everybody be quiet.

868
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,999
Yeah, everyone!

869
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,839
You got to be kidding me.

870
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,639
Aw, you know what?
Everyone just follow me, all right?

871
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,359
Don't look at anything. Just hurry.

872
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,279
- Hey, Tuck, did you see this?
- No, don't...

873
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,679
Dude, Tuck, this is
Mannequin Girl's house.

874
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,399
Now we can ask for
permission to steal stuff,

875
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,279
'cause, you know,
you guys are kissing buddies.

876
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,639
Aw, man...

877
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,959
It was a couple of days ago.

878
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,999
She probably forgot about
it by now, you know?

879
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,119
Like, yeah, it's... yeah,
she probably forgot.

880
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,560
- How would she forget about it?
- I almost forgot about it...

881
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,959
- Oh, boy, get ready.
- Uh-oh.

882
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,479
Close the door. Close the door.

883
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,559
Dude, we just got to keep it

884
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,559
from going crazy.
It's gonna get loud.

885
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,999
We'll catch it in a blanket.

886
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,319
- What?
- Whoa!

887
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,319
- Get down! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Stop letting it move!

888
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,399
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

889
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,879
How to unfold a napkin?!

890
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,839
- Who cares!
- Fine!

891
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,279
And in no time in my life
am I gonna be somewhere

892
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,519
- that even plays the foxtrot!
- Close the door.

893
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,959
Yo, put it away, man.

894
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,639
Shh. Be quiet.

895
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,079
What the...?

896
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,839
Wait, I know you.

897
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,399
Hey. It's okay.

898
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,719
Hey, hey, hey, we're with Tuck.

899
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,239
Tuck Simms. You know?
Remember you guys kissed?

900
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,639
- We what?
- Yeah, what are you talking about, huh?

901
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,439
Why is my room destroyed?

902
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,439
Why are you filming this?

903
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,799
- And what is that?
- Um, it's a...

904
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,039
it's a-a car muffler.

905
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,799
No. I want to know what that is.

906
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,079
It's actually a spaceship.

907
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,279
- Munch!
- Sorry. Uh, well,

908
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,599
we-we were following maps,
and it just happened

909
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,799
to lead here, so we were trying

910
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,759
to help our friend Echo...
well, he's an alien

911
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,399
- Oh, God...
- ...that we're trying to get him on a ship.

912
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,639
See, look, it used to have six symbols,
but now it has three, so that means

913
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,999
we're almost there. Crazy, right?

914
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,319
Munch, will you shut up?

915
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,519
An alien came to Earth
to give you guys maps?

916
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,519
- Nope.
- No, no.

917
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,319
- You did not just see that.
- Yeah, I did.

918
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,599
Yeah, she definitely saw it.

919
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,759
- Wait.
- Whoa, whoa.

920
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,159
- Hey, I want to go.
- Really? Sounds great.

921
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,639
What? No.

922
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,119
- Dude...
- You're not part of our group,

923
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,399
so why don't you just go play

924
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,039
with your super rich friends...

925
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,479
That's kind of harsh...

926
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,959
and your ball gowns and just
go eat steak or something.

927
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,879
- What the hell?
- Go, go, go.

928
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,759
Dang, dude, what was that upstairs?

929
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,279
- What are you talking about?
- I've never seen you so mad.

930
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,919
Yeah, dude, you did kind of snap.

931
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,919
All right, let's just...
don't talk about...

932
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,679
Nothing happened in there, all right?

933
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,559
You know, they say the
girls you argue with

934
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,119
are the ones you like.

935
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,439
Don't go there, bro.

936
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,149
Tuck, it's over there.

937
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,079
Wait, it wants us to go to a bar?

938
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,279
Man, I say we climb in a
window or find a door.

939
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,879
There's got to be another way.

940
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,599
Um, before-before we go...

941
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,239
I really need to get
the pee out of my body.

942
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,359
Let's just hope the
next place isn't a bank.

943
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,759
I can't believe you told
that girl to get lost.

944
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,279
- You're so dramatic.
- What about you?

945
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,159
You invented a whole
kiss, didn't you?

946
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,679
Uh, first of all, for your info,

947
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,079
it's called aspirational thinking.

948
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,919
You're thinking it one moment,
you're living it the next.

949
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,799
- How's that working out?
- Oh, excuse me.

950
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,504
Go to the bikes.

951
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,199
Oh, God, oh, God.

952
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,959
- Why is the construction man...
- Shut...

953
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,199
- Excuse me.
- Aw...

954
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,359
Hey.

955
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,519
I know you guys.

956
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,279
You're the guys... you're from
the construction site, right?

957
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,959
Uh, with the, uh, with the camera?

958
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,746
Whoa-ho, wait, wait.

959
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,159
Why aren't you guys
at home right now?

960
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,399
You guys weren't riding your bikes
out around the desert, were you?

961
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,959
- No, of course not.
- Yes.

962
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,507
Uh, no.

963
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,239
That doesn't sound too... clear.

964
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,799
- Uh...
- Thank God. There you are.

965
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,919
- What?
- Who-who are you?

966
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,479
Who am I?

967
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,359
Who am I? Exactly!

968
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,679
It's like I don't even know anymore.

969
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,759
My mom had to drag my
dad from the bar... again!

970
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,159
- What?
- He likes to go there

971
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,399
more than he likes to tuck
in his own kids at night.

972
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,799
At least that's what my mom says.

973
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,079
What's she talking about?

974
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,279
That's her.

975
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,479
Eating a burrito.

976
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,999
She east when she's stressed.

977
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,279
I ask myself if that's
gonna be me one day.

978
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,239
What do you think? Is it?

979
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,519
We make mistakes and we get married

980
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,919
and we go to bars.

981
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,079
And these... these are my
only friends in the world,

982
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,319
- 'cause they see me
- Uh...

983
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,559
for who I really am.

984
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,679
That's your mom over there?

985
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,599
- Do you want to meet her?
- No. No. No, no.

986
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,102
Just get home safe!

987
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,759
Told you guys I wanted to go.

988
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,799
What the...?

989
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,519
Okay, so this girl, man,

990
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,199
she'd been tailing us
since her house,

991
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,359
spying on us like
some creepy stalker.

992
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,479
- She'd overheard our whole plan.
- She... she's crazy.

993
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,639
- I need the bag!
- I think I like it.

994
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,839
Oh, boy, get ready.

995
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,199
All right, try to blend in. Look old.

996
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,559
That must've been
some good fake I.D.'s.

997
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,999
What's up, baby face?

998
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,359
What are you doing
in here, little man?

999
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,639
Oh, uh, I, uh...

1000
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,719
- Are you Randy's kid?
- Uh,

1001
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,719
- yes, he is.
- Um, y-yeah, yeah,

1002
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,519
yeah, he's my dad... or mom.

1003
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,759
- You know, dad. Mom.
- Okay, dude, just go.

1004
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,679
Hurry up.

1005
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,879
Emma? Emma?

1006
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,439
I was hanging out with
this really pretty chick.

1007
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,999
She's almost as pretty
as you. I mean...

1008
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,799
you're not pretty.
I mean, you are pretty.

1009
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,079
Come over here. Hop up on that stool.

1010
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,839
Get him a Shirley Temple.

1011
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,399
Oh, and one for his buddy here, too.

1012
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,199
No, no, I'm all right.
Seriously, I'm all right.

1013
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,279
- Sure, you'll like it.
- Sorry, I'm a... I'm allergic.

1014
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,719
Oh, you're gonna love it.

1015
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,159
- Uh, no, no.
- You're gonna get one.

1016
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,999
So, what happens next?

1017
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,599
- Just give me back my bag.
- No.

1018
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,559
Give it. I'm serious.
Give me the bag.

1019
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,759
Why are you being mean to me?

1020
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,559
- Here, honey.
- Thank you.

1021
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,039
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

1022
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,279
Wow, a lot of people with beards

1023
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,959
and mustaches in here, you know?

1024
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,079
You don't understand.
Whenever you get close

1025
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,959
to the next piece, it goes crazy.

1026
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,790
Oh, my God!

1027
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,119
Whoa! Aah!

1028
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,069
- Uh...
- Are you kidding me?

1029
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,759
Do you guys just go around
town breaking stuff?

1030
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,959
Just keep running! Go, go!

1031
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,159
What was that?

1032
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,839
I think the ship's
trying to take off!

1033
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,347
Are you seeing this?

1034
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,319
This thing is flying a ship...

1035
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,599
in your backpack?

1036
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,068
I think he's getting better.

1037
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,639
Oh.

1038
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,679
So, you don't know how
he crashed, or when,

1039
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,639
or why he came here with a
spaceship in the first place?

1040
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,701
Look, he only answers yes
or no... it's not that simple.

1041
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,159
Is this how I talk to him?

1042
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,719
So, you crashed.

1043
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,719
Did someone cause you to crash?

1044
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,639
Dude, what's she doing?

1045
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,479
- I don't know.
- Someone on Earth?

1046
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,679
Do you think they're looking for you?

1047
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,799
It's not those guys in trucks

1048
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,839
from the convenience store, is it?

1049
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,839
The construction man?

1050
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,399
Those are the guys
that shot you down?

1051
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,679
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

1052
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,439
We got to take a step back.

1053
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,039
This is way bigger and
shadier than before, okay?

1054
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,239
This is not good.

1055
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,119
If those dudes are looking for Echo,

1056
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,079
they're looking for us, you know?

1057
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,519
Echo?

1058
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,879
You need some help there, buddy?

1059
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,519
Hey, it's okay. Shh.

1060
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,959
Breathe like me, okay?

1061
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,319
It's okay.

1062
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,279
Dude, h-he'll be fine.

1063
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,148
No. We're not leaving him.

1064
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,381
My whole life, I've been left.

1065
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,639
I know how it feels.

1066
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,708
We're all he's got.

1067
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,999
- Uh, left?
- We could find a shortcut.

1068
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,399
The map says up ahead.

1069
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,639
This map's confusing.
I was a mind ninja back there...

1070
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,559
- So, what was it like kissing me?
- Give me my camera.

1071
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,759
Did your legs get all wobbly?

1072
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,119
Was there soft music playing?
Please remind me, Tuck.

1073
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,999
I totally forgot.

1074
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,559
- What was it like?
- You're close.

1075
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,719
Is this your first imaginary kiss?

1076
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,719
The map says for us to go inside.

1077
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,319
I'm confused.

1078
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,359
- Huh?
- Didn't you guys kiss?

1079
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,759
Anyway, the point is,

1080
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,639
Emma was being annoying...
she kept walking off

1081
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,199
with Echo like she owned him,
and talking to him about

1082
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,959
I don't know what, I don't even know.

1083
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,224
You know what? Delete.

1084
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,719
Man, are we sure there's
no security guards or...

1085
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,719
You know, that door
wasn't even locked.

1086
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,319
Hey, uh, guys, I was
just thinking, you know,

1087
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,959
I... haven't got to actually
hold the, you know, the ship,

1088
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,839
before we did the
thing, so can I do it?

1089
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,639
- You know, before it gets crazy?
- Sure, but...

1090
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,879
it's not a ship.

1091
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,759
What? What are you talking about?

1092
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,959
He told us it was a ship.

1093
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,199
It's a key to your ship, right?

1094
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,159
Well, if this is just the key,

1095
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,344
where's the spaceship?

1096
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,839
All right, Munch, put it down.

1097
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,359
Okay, dude, no, I got it, I got it.

1098
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,519
Okay, I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you to put it down

1099
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,959
- before you hurt both of us.
- I need this, man.

1100
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,159
That's weird.

1101
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,142
- Does it know her?
- I don't know. Munch!

1102
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,519
Whoa!

1103
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,799
Whoa!

1104
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,919
You okay?

1105
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,119
- Yeah.
- What are you guys doing?

1106
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,719
- Wow.
- Um, she was gonna get hit

1107
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,759
by the piece, so I-I saved her.

1108
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,039
Hey! You four! Freeze!

1109
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,439
- Run!
- Which way?

1110
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,999
- Tuck!
- Stop right there! Stop!

1111
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,759
Go, go! Hurry up!

1112
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,679
Hold up, hold up! Did Alex get out?

1113
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,079
Uh, I d... I don't know.

1114
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,239
- We have to go back.
- Uh...

1115
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,119
- Come on, you guys.
- Okay.

1116
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,079
Look. Whoa, whoa. She's being stupid.

1117
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,759
There's a guard in there, you know?

1118
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,919
You can't just go
running in, acting crazy.

1119
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,239
We need a-a plan, or...

1120
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,344
S... right?

1121
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,799
Breaking and entering,
destruction of property.

1122
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,079
Those are felonies, kid.

1123
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,759
Okay, Echo, I need your help.

1124
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,719
Um, I need you to... do something.

1125
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,159
I have a minor here; he's 13.

1126
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,839
Caught him breaking
in with his friends.

1127
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,626
If you could send an officer down.

1128
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,919
Stay put.

1129
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,239
Hello?

1130
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,399
Anybody there?

1131
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,559
Hello?

1132
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,319
Hello?

1133
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,959
Is anybody there?

1134
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,159
...there...
Is anybody there... there...

1135
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,519
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1136
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,359
Alex. Alex.

1137
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,479
- Wh-Where's Tuck?
- We got to go.

1138
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,959
- We should've gone back.
- All right, you know what?

1139
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,879
Calm down, because if people
would've listened to me,

1140
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,759
then Alex never would
have gotten caught.

1141
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,945
Didn't I say there would
be security guards?

1142
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,639
Alex! Dude!

1143
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,999
You're all right! Are you all right?

1144
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,639
Hey, Alex, we're good,
man. All right?

1145
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,824
- Buddy?
- We're good, man?

1146
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,865
Alex.

1147
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,266
Come on, dude.

1148
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,707
Alex!

1149
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,079
We could've gone home, but we didn't.

1150
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,959
- We were outside.
- Turn off the camera.

1151
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,239
Not till you admit you're
acting mopey for no reason.

1152
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,639
You're always freaking out if
anyone's gonna leave you behind.

1153
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,639
Do you know how expensive that is?

1154
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,799
I'm glad I'm moving.
You were never my friend.

1155
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,439
- Is that right? Is that right?
- Guys, guys,

1156
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,705
- come on, just-just chill out.
- Come on!

1157
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,159
Have you lost your mind?

1158
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,559
I acted like I didn't
know what I'd done.

1159
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,719
But I knew exactly.

1160
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,999
I know we're all tired
and stuff, and hungry.

1161
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,199
I saw this awesome diner.
We can totally just go grab

1162
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,319
- a bite to eat or something.
- Real awesome, guys.

1163
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,788
Real macho.

1164
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,759
So, that's it?

1165
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,103
The night's over?

1166
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,110
Doesn't have to be.

1167
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,141
Right?

1168
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,150
Well, I mean, if it is,

1169
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,719
uh, we could...

1170
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,319
I don't know, I guess we can
keep the mood going, yeah?

1171
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,079
Or we can do it another time, right?

1172
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,519
Good times,
the continuation, part two.

1173
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,545
Right?

1174
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,067
Hmm.

1175
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,799
You know what?

1176
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,799
I'm gonna talk about Sandra.

1177
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,199
Man, that girl used to
beat the crap out of you.

1178
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,759
Me, too.

1179
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,799
We were both little,
small and scrawny.

1180
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,199
She was a big girl, and she knew it.

1181
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,919
But then I had a growth spurt,

1182
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,879
and you didn't, and I
finally did something.

1183
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,519
You remember that?

1184
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,239
You told her I had polio.

1185
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,141
Yeah, I told her that, and did
she beat you up after that?

1186
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,119
She still beat me up.

1187
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,599
'Cause I-I always get your back, man.

1188
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,159
I never let you down;
I always get your back.

1189
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,590
Most of the time.

1190
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,399
Just when I'm not freaked out

1191
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,982
about security guards, all right?

1192
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,026
I'm sorry, man.

1193
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,185
Are we good?

1194
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,199
Yeah.

1195
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,119
Dude.

1196
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,026
Faster.

1197
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,399
Sure are doing some
traveling tonight.

1198
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,028
My parents are in the bathroom.

1199
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,999
Uh-huh.

1200
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,941
Let it go.

1201
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,919
What are you doing?

1202
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,399
- Dude! Hey, what are you doing?!
- Oh, God!

1203
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,879
Don't grab our stuff like that!

1204
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,079
- Stop!
- Hey, give me the backpack!

1205
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,959
- Who do you think you are?
- The police have been instructed

1206
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,279
to come and pick up these
kids and take them home.

1207
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,781
He can't just walk away.

1208
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,639
What was it?

1209
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,679
- The phone.
- No, no, no!

1210
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,759
- Munch!
- Munch!

1211
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,399
- Munch! Munch!
- Munch!

1212
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,599
Munch!

1213
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,079
Oh, my... Munch!

1214
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,599
This is not real, this is not real,

1215
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,023
this is not real right now.

1216
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,999
Don't let them see you.

1217
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,599
Now!

1218
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,839
Munch!

1219
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,079
Do you see the truck?

1220
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,991
Munch!

1221
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,511
Munch!

1222
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,359
That guy is not a
construction worker.

1223
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,119
- It's Munch.
- I need help, guys.

1224
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,279
I really didn't think this through.

1225
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,559
We're here, we're here. Are you hurt?

1226
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,719
Can you guys hear me...?

1227
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,919
- Are you okay?
- Where are you, Munch?

1228
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,199
We'll find you, all right? I promise.

1229
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,159
I think I'm at the construction site.

1230
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,399
- Come on, buddy.
- Munch!

1231
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,679
I can see the big lights

1232
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,879
and up at those...

1233
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,319
the white trucks...

1234
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,839
How far is your neighborhood?

1235
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,999
It's way over an hour.

1236
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,720
All right, I think I
got a faster way.

1237
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,319
Who wants to go to a party?

1238
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,799
Are you sure he'll even be here?

1239
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,119
Better be.

1240
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,999
His girlfriend's throwing it.

1241
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,439
I can't believe we're doing this.

1242
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,239
Sophomores.

1243
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,839
Hey, sweet party. Sweet jams.

1244
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,759
Guys, what are we
doing here? We can't be...

1245
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,959
Just look for my brother.
Look for his keys.

1246
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,719
- Oh, my gosh, it's the cops.
- Okay.

1247
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,359
Oh, God, the keys, the keys.

1248
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,039
I lost my keys.

1249
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,199
I have a Porsche.

1250
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,519
Marcus! Oh, not you, sorry.

1251
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,359
I wasn't trying to stop
the fun... I like it.

1252
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,639
Whoa...!

1253
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,839
Hi.

1254
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,359
Uh, sorry to bother everyone.

1255
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,799
Have you seen my brother, Marcus?

1256
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,599
Tall guy? You seen his car keys?

1257
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,239
- Uh, anyone?
- Guys, the cops are here!

1258
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,799
- What?
- Yeah, the cops are here.

1259
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,559
- Turn it down, turn it down.
- Dude, stop...

1260
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,519
No, I'm serious,
the cops are here right now.

1261
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,079
Alex! Alex!

1262
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,399
We have to go now.

1263
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,279
All right, just come on, come on.

1264
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,519
We got to move.

1265
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,101
Hurry, hurry.

1266
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,679
We can't hide here.

1267
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,919
Look, look, just stay here.

1268
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,319
He's my brother; I'll find him.

1269
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,639
Just... don't let the
cops take the footage.

1270
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,799
All right?

1271
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,319
You live here, right?

1272
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,559
The cops!

1273
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,039
Marcus?

1274
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,759
Marcus, we're here.

1275
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,119
The party's shut down.

1276
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,839
That's enough. Come on.

1277
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,119
Oh, my God.

1278
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,719
Tuck's gonna freak.

1279
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,439
Uh, here, check his pockets.

1280
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,430
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

1281
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,959
Cops are gone.

1282
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,960
- Uh, Tuck, Tuck?
- I have no idea where Marcus is.

1283
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,159
Yeah.

1284
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,599
Tell me you got that on tape?

1285
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,787
My name is Reginald "Munch" Barrett.

1286
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,239
This is my... kind of
my final message.

1287
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,141
To my best friends...

1288
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,389
I love you, guys.

1289
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,799
You're Googling it? Really?

1290
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,399
Oh, come on, this is what
the Internet is for.

1291
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,879
Um, "step one,
get a driver's license."

1292
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,239
- Do we have one of those?
- Oh, wow.

1293
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,439
All right, am I good?

1294
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,959
Stop! Stop!

1295
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,119
All right, all right.

1296
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,359
Dude, do you even know
what you're doing?

1297
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,559
No, I don't.

1298
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,279
"Step two, be calm."

1299
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,839
What are you doing?!

1300
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,399
- Sorry, sorry.
- Be calm is step two?

1301
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,959
All right, all right, all right.

1302
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,439
I got it, I got it.

1303
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,719
Hold on a sec..

1304
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,239
- Stop!
- Tuck, Tuck, turn!

1305
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,199
- Whoa!
- Oh, I'm sorry about that.

1306
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,359
- Uh...
- Oh, my God.

1307
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,749
We're good, we're good.

1308
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,519
All right, I'm excited.
Should I gun it?

1309
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,022
- No, no, no, don't.
- No, Tuck.

1310
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,319
I need, I need music.
Somebody just play some music.

1311
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,879
All right.

1312
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,399
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my God.

1313
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,119
Change it.

1314
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,279
Everywhere we'd been that night,

1315
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,509
shot by us like a rocket.

1316
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,506
All we wanted was our friends back.

1317
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,159
I'm gonna miss it here, man.

1318
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,425
Yeah, me too.

1319
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,660
Here we go.

1320
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,021
I don't know about this.

1321
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,266
Did you hear that?

1322
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,861
Yeah.

1323
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,639
That does not look like a freeway.

1324
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,941
Get down.

1325
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,599
Shh, Shh.

1326
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,239
All right, so what's the plan?

1327
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,519
I don't know. Get him out?

1328
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,261
So, in other words,
we don't have a plan.

1329
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,620
Go, go, go.

1330
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,159
I'm just gonna call Munch's phone

1331
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,359
and see if his phone rings.

1332
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,742
Wait a minute.

1333
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,599
Dude, my camera's not a doorstop.

1334
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,119
I hear his voice.

1335
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,479
Shh.

1336
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,399
I-I knew it was you guys

1337
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,439
'cause I saw the same truck
from my neighborhood.

1338
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,719
Tell us the truth.

1339
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,359
I-I had a lot of adrenaline rush,

1340
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,759
and... I...

1341
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,759
I didn't want the night to end.

1342
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,919
And I... and it was the
last night with Alex.

1343
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,359
Oh, shit, Munch.

1344
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,639
Stop crying and talk to us.

1345
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,279
This is not good.

1346
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,519
I'm not... I'm not crying!

1347
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,399
What? Where is that?

1348
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,759
We got to find him and
get him out of there, man.

1349
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,359
Just don't kill me!

1350
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,839
Did he access your phones at all?

1351
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,639
Were there others like it or was
this the only one you found?

1352
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,279
What are they doing?

1353
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,479
Dude, they're breaking him!

1354
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,319
Guys?

1355
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,959
Guys, someone's coming. We should go.

1356
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,679
Go, go.

1357
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,919
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, construction man!

1358
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,679
- Give me the camera.
- Listen...

1359
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,159
This is not your camera.
Hey, guys, go!

1360
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,719
- And find Munch!
- Let go of me!

1361
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,919
Get off of us, man, this isn't...

1362
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,079
- My camera!
- Let go.

1363
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,627
Is that thing still on?

1364
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,559
Okay, no more lies.

1365
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,479
No more sneaking around.

1366
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,639
No more cameras, understand?

1367
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,399
Son, look at me.

1368
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,425
Look at me.

1369
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:03,159
Oh, I-I see better
with my glasses on,

1370
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,150
you know?

1371
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,679
This signal has been transmitting

1372
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,799
for a very long time,
from a ship that we believe

1373
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,839
is located right here
in your neighborhood.

1374
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:16,439
- What?
- Wait, what's he talking about?

1375
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,919
Six days ago,

1376
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,839
an object entered our atmosphere

1377
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,559
at 20,000 miles an hour,

1378
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,028
on a direct course for that ship.

1379
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:26,959
We shot it down.

1380
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,439
What you found activates the ship,

1381
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,879
and if that ship takes off,
it could kill everyone.

1382
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,599
He just wants to go home.

1383
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,039
Okay, that will not happen.

1384
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,759
He is far too valuable.

1385
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,359
This is crazy, this is crazy.

1386
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,021
So...

1387
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,799
we are gonna follow this map

1388
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,359
and you are gonna help us
get that thing operational,

1389
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,359
and it will lead us back to its ship,

1390
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,159
and we will disable it permanently.

1391
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,439
Am I clear?

1392
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,879
Am I clear?

1393
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,039
Y-Yeah.

1394
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,871
Good.

1395
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,719
Check the doors, check the doors.

1396
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,159
It's locked; it's not just locked.

1397
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,359
They don't have a handle on it.

1398
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,759
- Someone help!
- Where are they taking us?

1399
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,159
Hey, yo!

1400
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,599
Let us out, man!

1401
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,943
Someone!

1402
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,679
Well, the sun's up.

1403
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,439
Our parents are gonna find out.

1404
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,221
I think we got bigger
problems than our parents.

1405
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,585
Where are we?

1406
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,759
Let's go!

1407
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,079
All right, everybody knows the drill.

1408
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,239
Let's set it up.

1409
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,188
- He's not moving.
- Stop!

1410
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,199
Can you see me?

1411
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,839
Beep?

1412
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,079
We're all here.

1413
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,959
We're gonna get you home, all right?

1414
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,999
We'll find a way.

1415
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,679
Nichols, man, it's not there.

1416
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,591
No.

1417
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,150
Please, you have to work.

1418
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,145
Just try.

1419
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,759
Echo?

1420
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,079
Don't!

1421
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,279
Echo!

1422
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,119
You can't go; you can't!

1423
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,559
It's over.

1424
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:27,427
Let's keep them quiet.

1425
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,479
Come on, man. It's...

1426
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,267
It's time to go.

1427
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,199
What's happening?

1428
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,039
What is that?

1429
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,589
Here he goes.

1430
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,919
Back up. Get ready.

1431
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,230
Whoa.

1432
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,279
Okay, now!

1433
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,599
Where are we going?

1434
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,228
Home! His ship's in Mulberry Woods.

1435
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,519
Dude, go!

1436
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,719
How do I drive?

1437
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:20,959
Will you drive?!

1438
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,879
Please drive! Just hurry up!

1439
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,159
Alex, dude, you don't
have your seat belt on!

1440
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,399
- Just speed up!
- Just go!

1441
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,319
Go, go, go, go, go!

1442
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,799
They're right there!
You have to speed!

1443
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,959
- I'm trying!
- You're driving...!

1444
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,519
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
- Tuck, you're gonna

1445
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,959
get us killed!

1446
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,679
- Where do I go?
- Just go around them.

1447
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,319
- No, hold on.
- Don't go on the wrong side!

1448
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,839
Dude, stop, stop!

1449
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,587
- Oh!
- What the...?

1450
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,471
- Oh, my gosh.
- Whoa, whoa!

1451
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,039
Are you... Are you seeing this?

1452
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,744
Thanks, buddy.

1453
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,599
I need an Advil.

1454
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,079
We can't afford this right now.

1455
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,105
We really can't afford
this right now.

1456
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,039
Dude, look, there's a new map.

1457
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,439
A what?

1458
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,799
Here, here, give me the phones back.

1459
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,559
I think that's his ship.

1460
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,839
Whoa, that's a big ship.

1461
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,919
Alex, I don't want to
stress you out or anything,

1462
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,639
but they're right there!

1463
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,079
Oh, my God.

1464
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,399
Alex, it's your mom.

1465
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,719
- Don't answer it.
- Why would I answer it?

1466
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,479
- Betty?
- Dude.

1467
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,239
- Munch.
- Betty?

1468
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,559
Hi.

1469
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,599
- Sorry about my tone last night.
- Oh, I just thought

1470
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,799
it would be nice to have
the boys have a nice night

1471
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,359
- together before we're all uprooted.
- You're crying.

1472
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,199
- Munch, it's your mom.
- What?!

1473
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,679
Look, look, look, look. Dude.

1474
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,319
- You okay?
- So, Janice, gotta go... on my jog.

1475
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,504
Can we act like we never
had this conversation?

1476
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,748
Uh, uh, just come over this wall.

1477
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,959
Are you up?

1478
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,719
- Guys, they're here.
- Jump.

1479
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,239
- Move!
- Faster!

1480
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,479
They can't catch us
in our own backyard.

1481
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,279
Let's cut them off.

1482
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,679
Munch, hurry up!

1483
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,839
- Okay, okay.
- Munch!

1484
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,559
Well, I don't jump
walls very much, man!

1485
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,519
Here, hold my camera.

1486
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,439
Dude, come on, come on, come on.

1487
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,119
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Tuck, wait!

1488
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,039
They're right behind us!

1489
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,439
Come on, guys, we got
to go, we got to go.

1490
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,624
Let's go, right now.

1491
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,679
It's down the hill.
Come on, let's go!

1492
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,479
Shh.

1493
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:36,959
Go, go, go.

1494
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,839
It says the ship is up ahead.

1495
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,639
This is the way to your house, man.

1496
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,427
- Go, go, go, guys!
- Are your parents awake?

1497
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,319
I think we...

1498
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:46,919
I think we lost them.

1499
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,719
Okay.

1500
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,759
I don't... I don't get it.

1501
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,119
I...

1502
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,879
This is where the map ends.

1503
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,359
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship.

1504
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,799
Maybe it's invisible.

1505
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,919
What is it?

1506
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,279
Wait, what-what's he talking about?

1507
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,239
What do you want us to...

1508
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,599
Dude, what? Whoa, whoa.

1509
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,639
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1510
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,063
- Whoa, whoa...
- Oh.

1511
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,999
Everybody good?

1512
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,309
What's down there?

1513
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,424
Be careful, man.

1514
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,879
What?

1515
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,479
That's it.

1516
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,439
Dude, it-it's underneath.

1517
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,348
So this whole time...

1518
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,079
That's why they want all our houses.

1519
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,265
They were digging.

1520
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,759
Yo, Alex, I know
what you're thinking.

1521
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,959
Alex!

1522
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,359
Alex, man!

1523
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,679
Th-The only way that
thing can take off

1524
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,799
is to come up out of
the ground through us.

1525
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,519
That's a really bad idea.

1526
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,799
Dude, what are you doing?

1527
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,719
This is not just about us anymore.

1528
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,119
It's about other people now,

1529
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,879
a whole community still
asleep in their beds.

1530
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,599
Let's just think this through first.

1531
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,319
- I trust him.
- Listen to us.

1532
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,107
Alex! Alex! Alex!

1533
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,319
Is this where we're supposed to be?

1534
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,439
Make up a plan.

1535
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,799
- No, we got to run.
- What are you talking about?

1536
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,039
- If the ship's right under...
- We can't leave.

1537
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,279
- I know we can't leave him.
- What about Alex?

1538
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,799
What about everyone up
here that's gonna die?

1539
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,064
Alex!

1540
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,506
Dude, say something!

1541
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,385
Oh, my God.

1542
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,786
I left you behind once.

1543
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,702
I'm not doing it again.

1544
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,079
Hi, guys.

1545
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,150
Whoa.

1546
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,599
Whoa.

1547
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,879
This...

1548
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,702
this is in-insane.

1549
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,039
So, um, beep.

1550
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,182
Uh, um,

1551
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,428
I don't really know
how to say good-bye...

1552
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,319
so I'm not gonna.

1553
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,679
And, um...

1554
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,959
Um...

1555
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,224
You're my friend, you know?

1556
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,719
Even when I'm old,

1557
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:27,199
even when... even when
you think I've forgotten...

1558
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,119
I'm always gonna be there.

1559
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,999
Do you feel that?

1560
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,359
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1561
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,510
Guys, we need to go now!

1562
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,746
We have to go.

1563
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,479
Bye.

1564
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,345
Go, go, go!

1565
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,381
Wait, wait, wait, my camera!

1566
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,799
Are you okay?

1567
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,679
- Yeah, yeah.
- Dude, are you all right?

1568
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:31,999
- Everybody good?
- Are you all right? Okay.

1569
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,479
That was so close.

1570
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,519
What the heck?

1571
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,782
- Oh, my...
- What the...?

1572
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,189
Yeah!

1573
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,824
Oh, my God.

1574
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,919
Dude, this is amazing.

1575
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,079
I think you're gonna
want to get this.

1576
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,582
Oh!

1577
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,279
We did it, dude.

1578
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,350
We did it.

1579
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,399
Dude!

1580
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,743
Did you see that?

1581
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,279
Did you see...

1582
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,319
- Wow. We did that!
- You're like...

1583
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,919
That's insane. We just did that!

1584
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,599
That's... Look, come on.

1585
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,479
Look, look, people want
to know what happened.

1586
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,719
if we told them what happened,
they wouldn't believe us.

1587
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,159
Guys,

1588
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,879
it's morning.

1589
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,879
Oh, crap, I gotta get home.

1590
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,039
- My dad is gonna kill me.
- I think I need a ride.

1591
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,039
We should go because people,
they'll start asking...

1592
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,639
Hey, buddy... Did you guys
feel that earthquake?

1593
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,079
- Were you okay?
- No, Mom, I'm fine.

1594
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,599
- Let me see.
- He's fine. Honey, he's fine.

1595
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,959
Did no one just see
the giant spaceship?!

1596
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,239
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, a spaceship.

1597
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:50,399
What just happened?!

1598
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,559
Oh, oh, okay, okay.

1599
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,439
I know it's been really hard lately,

1600
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,159
- and we've all been really overwhelmed.
- Just...

1601
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,719
Why don't we... why don't
we just go in and relax.

1602
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,759
Maybe we can, um, go get
that-that pizza we talked about.

1603
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:03,119
- All right? Yeah.
- Pizza?

1604
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,559
- If we don't play along,
- Yeah, his mom saw the ship.

1605
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:06,999
- Nobody's gonna get it okay?
- How could I play along?

1606
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,439
- So just...
- Yes, I'm sure.

1607
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,159
I found them here at Alex's.

1608
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,399
Yeah, yeah.

1609
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,839
Uh, no, no.

1610
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:15,119
Actually, uh, we found him here.

1611
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,119
I thought he was staying with you.

1612
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,159
No, I was told they were at Munch's.

1613
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,662
I'll call you back, babe.

1614
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,559
Yeah, yeah, they were at my house.

1615
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,599
We-we played this game
where you play as a guy

1616
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,279
with the soul of a dragon,
and it had really good voices.

1617
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,439
The voices were great, so...

1618
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,959
Who's this?

1619
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,439
That's Emma.

1620
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:43,319
I'm, uh, he's my boyfriend.

1621
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,599
I mean, friend who's a boy.

1622
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,399
- Um...
- Awkward.

1623
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,119
She's hot, right?

1624
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,826
Knock it off, you.

1625
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:09,911
Six hours later, Alex moved.

1626
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,879
I just got grounded for, like, life.

1627
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,879
Me, too.

1628
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,439
Might as well move now.

1629
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,239
Not gonna be seeing
anyone for a while.

1630
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,439
Yeah.

1631
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,959
But this...

1632
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,799
what really happened tonight...

1633
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,719
no one knows but us.

1634
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,319
Hey, Alex!

1635
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,265
Time to go, buddy.

1636
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,983
I'm gonna miss you guys.

1637
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,599
You guys smell really bad.

1638
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,519
Our last night together,

1639
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,021
we did a lot.

1640
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,227
A whole lot.

1641
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,909
But there's some
things we couldn't do.

1642
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,079
Alex's parents had already
bought a new home.

1643
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,999
Most of the neighborhood had.

1644
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,626
Munch's, too.

1645
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,439
So, one by one,

1646
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,319
people started to move.

1647
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:30,559
My parents hadn't,

1648
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,301
so we got to stay.

1649
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,559
New people started moving in,

1650
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,710
and Mulberry Wood started again,

1651
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:42,062
but not the one that
had my friends in it.

1652
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,551
When you're a kid,

1653
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,740
you think you're invisible.

1654
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,741
You think you can't
make a difference.

1655
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,509
We're not kids anymore.

1656
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,346
We know now...

1657
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,626
that we can do anything.

1658
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,679
Having a friend light-years
away taught us

1659
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,626
that distance is just
a state of mind.

1660
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:39,068
If you're best friends,
then you always will be...

1661
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,359
no matter where you
are in the universe.

1662
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,639
<i>I see this life like
a swingin' vine</i>

1663
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,559
<i>Swing my heart across the line</i>

1664
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,599
<i>In my face is flashin' signs</i>

1665
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,319
<i>Seek it out and ye shall find</i>

1666
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,439
<i>Old, but I'm not that old</i>

1667
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,319
<i>Young, but I'm not that bold</i>

1668
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,439
<i>I don't think the world is sold</i>

1669
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:26,559
<i>I'm just doing what we're told</i>

1670
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:30,999
<i>I feel something so right</i>

1671
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,741
<i>At doing the wrong thing</i>

1672
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:38,839
<i>I feel something so wrong</i>

1673
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:41,879
<i>At doing the right thing</i>

1674
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,599
<i>I could lie, could lie, could lie</i>

1675
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,679
<i>Everything that kills
me makes me feel alive</i>

1676
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:53,519
<i>Lately, I've been,
I've been losing sleep</i>

1677
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,959
<i>Dreaming about the
things that we could be</i>

1678
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,079
<i>But baby, I've been,
I've been praying hard</i>

1679
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:04,919
<i>Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars</i>

1680
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:08,959
<i>Lately, I've been,
I've been losing sleep</i>

1681
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,559
<i>Dreaming about the
things that we could be</i>

1682
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,719

01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,359

1684
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,479
<i>We'll be, we'll be, counting stars</i>

1685
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,039
<i>Take that money Watch it burn</i>

1686
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,159
<i>Sink in the river

1687

01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,079
You guys got to see this.
