No, I don't go to school here.
I'm too dumb.

from high school goes here.

in so long? It's ridiculous."

- This is the day that you become a man.

It's your people's fault.

what I mean. Like, your people.

- I understand what you're saying,

- but I can't...
MILLER: - In America,

134

in the United States of America,
bald eagles and Budweiser,

135
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:16,038
you go out and drink because
it's a sacred rite of passage.

136
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,915
- It's just like in Africa when...
- Oh, my God.

If we were in Africa...
You are so lucky we're not in Africa.

138
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,460
If we were in Africa, you would
have to leave the village

till you killed a bear.

- No.

- I was born in America.

and they fuck you with alcohol.

- Oh, my God.

- Nope.

I'm not! A little bit.

Also, if you do not
come out tonight,

158

I will stand outside your

160
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,683
- OK, OK, OK, I'll go out!
- I can't hear you!

161
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,386
- This thing is super loud!
- I'll go out, just stop! Just stop!

162
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,056
That's what I'm saying.
That wasn't so hard.

163
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,808
What kind of asshole brings
an air horn in his backpack?

164
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,310
Honestly, it comes in handy
more than you'd think.

165
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:22,063
- Just one beer. One beer.
- That's all I wanted.

166
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,439
- We'll take care of you.
- That's it, man.

167
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:26,006
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
You're my little baby tonight.

- Dude! How you doing?
- I'm doing great, dude.

177
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,358
- Good to see you guys!
- What's up, dude?

178
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:57,139
It's awesome to see you. Honestly,
'cause I miss you. I miss your hugs.

179
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,350
- Yeah. OK. OK.
- Give me a hug.

180
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:03,270
Are you, uh... are you...
Are you sure you're OK, man?

181
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,481
You're fine, like,
should we maybe get going?

182
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,441
No, Casey, look at me. I'm fine.

183
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:08,943
- I'm fine.
- You look fine.

184
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,319
- I'm fine.
- He's fine.

185
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:12,363
- You know what this bar reminds me of?
- What?

186
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,449
The night we won Rothenberg's
Beer Pong tournament, and Jeff Chang

187
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,827
hooked up with that nine-foot tall
chick who played the banjo.

188
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,314
- Yeah, what was her name?
- Tara.

189
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,496
CASEY: - Tara!
- Yeah, Tara!

190
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,039
She was gigantic.

191
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,125
Man, high school was so awesome.

192
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,132
Speaking of the banjo,
you still writing music?

193
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:29,463
Dude, I'm pre-med, man. I don't
write music. I don't listen to music.

194
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,507
I can't even remember
the last time I went to a show.

195
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,217
- Fuck, man.
- Yeah.

196
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:35,553
Hey, you're still in for Sidewinder
at The Gorge this summer, right?

197
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,389
- Hell, yeah! The Gorge!
- Right, OK! The Gorge!

198
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:39,932
- Casey, what about you, man?
- Hm?

199
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:42,601
- The Gorge, Sidewinder.
- Oh, I don't know, man.

200
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:46,522
Aren't we too old to be doing
the whole music festival thing?

201
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,524
Uh, I don't know, Casey, are
we too old to have fun times?

202
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,359
- No.
- Are we too old to spend a week

203
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,903
enjoying 250 bands play
the seminal music of our generation?

204
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,698
Are we too old to drop acid and make
love to white chicks in dreadlocks?

205
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:57,865
- I don't like dreadlocks.
- Are we too old to take

206
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,077
handfuls of Ecstasy and dance around
in fur... with other people in fur?

207
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,121
Yeah, we are too old
for all of those things.

208
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:03,289
I don't like dreadlocks.

209
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,975
But, guys, all I'm saying is
that we all graduate in May, right?

210
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,628
This could be the last summer all three
of us ever spend together. You know?

211
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,258
Right, but I have a job
lined up after graduation.

212
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,677
- What?
- You got a fucking job?

213
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:20,890
Yeah. I'm working for
Newbury Capital in New York.

214
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,851
- Dude, congrats, that's a great firm!
- Thanks, Jeff Chang. See?

215
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:26,395
Yeah, awesome. What about Sidewinder
at The Gorge, Casey?

216
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:28,105
I'll think about it, all right?
That's all I'm saying.

217
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:31,650
- Yeah. You're selfish. That's bullshit.
WOMAN: - Jeff! Jeff!

218
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,153
JEFFCHANG: - Oh, Nicole!
- Holy shit, game on.

219
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,572
- Hey, how are you doing?
(LAUGHS) Happy birthday!

220
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,824
Hey. Meet my oldest friends,
Miller, Casey.

221
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:40,534
We used to tear shit up
in high school.

222
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,494
Casey.
Nice to meet you, Nicole.

223
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,413
Wow, that's quite a firm shake.

224
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,123
That's 'cause he masturbates a lot.

225
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,126
Oh, yeah? Me too. I can't get to sleep
without flicking the bean.

226
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:53,714
What? Wow, I guess we already
have a lot in common. That's great.

227
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,507
Yeah, I masturbate a lot, too.

228
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,134
- He does.
- Like a lot.

229
00:11:57,301 --> 00:12:00,095
- Oh.
- At weird places too, like malls,

230
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,223
bathrooms, handicap stalls.
They're bigger.

231
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,149
Name some more spots
you jerk off in, Miller.

232
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,185
Sometimes I wear flannel.
Made me feel like a lumberjack.

233
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,646
- What the fuck?
- I am so sorry for him.

234
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,648
I don't even know you.
I feel terrible.

235
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,900
What are you talking about? I feel like
she's picking up what I'm putting down.

236
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,188
- Oh.
- Yeah, but then again,

237
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:17,029
- she's putting it down again.
- But then she picks it back up.

238
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:19,198
I feel like she'd never
really pick it up twice.

239
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:22,034
OK, look, I'm just gonna ask.
Who would you rather...?

240
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:24,036
- Him.
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God.

241
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,123
- OK, it's over. It's over.
CASEY: - Oh, my God.

242
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,915
- This is embarrassing.
- That's fine, that's fine.

243
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:29,917
Fuck you all, I'm gonna
go play some darts.

244
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,336
Have a really boring life
with my boring friend Casey,

245
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:34,463
- who played the flute in band.
- Shh.

246
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,757
OK, thanks, buddy. Enjoy.

247
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,134
Wow. Thank you for that.
Oh, my God.

248
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,512
- Here, sit down.
- You're welcome. Thank you.

249
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,348
So, um...
So, that's your friend?

250
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,356
Yeah, we were best friends
back in high school,

251
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,269
but we're not really that close anymore.

252
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,035
Yeah. Your oldest friends are always
your weirdest friends, right?

253
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,440
- Yeah, what is that about?
- I don't know.

254
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,609
People change when
they go to college, right?

255
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,654
Like, I'm sure he wasn't that
big of an idiot back in high school.

256
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,470
No, actually, that's exactly
how big of an idiot he was, yeah.

257
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,056
- Hundred percent same amount of idiot.
(LAUGHS) Really? OK.

258
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:09,498
Yeah. So you're in,
uh, Sigma... Zeta...

259
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,500
- ...circle with a line in it.
- Oh, OK.

260
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,252
- I get it, you're not in a frat?
- No.

261
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:17,089
- 'Cause I'm not angry and secretly gay.
(CHUCKLES) Wow!

262
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,424
So, what are you drinking?

263
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,551
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

264
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,807
Oh, dude, I'm so glad you guys came.
I really needed this.

265
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,934
- My dad's been driving me crazy.
MILLER: - Yeah man, we love you.

266
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,895
- We wouldn't miss it for anything.
- Miller! (LAUGHS)

267
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,502
Honestly, I'm sorry Casey's
being such a little bitch, though.

268
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,066
- He's not being a bitch.
- Dude, yeah, he is.

269
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,235
Honestly, I feel like he thinks that
he's too good for us and it's like,

270
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,570
"Bro, you're a nerd."

271
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,405
He's not a nerd.
He's our friend.

272
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,198
You're lucky to be hanging out
with us because we're awesome.

273
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,159
Dude, he's just trying to be happy.

274
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,619
So, you leave for Brazil tomorrow?

275
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:51,582
Yes, and then Chile,
Ecuador and Argentina.

276
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,542
What about you? What are
you doing for spring break?

277
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:56,211
I have a two week externship
at J.P. Morgan.

278
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,172
It's private equity stuff.
It's pretty cool.

279
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:02,343
- You know? It's not that cool.
- Wait.

280
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:07,139
So, on the last spring break
of your entire life, you're working?

281
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,558
Yeah, why? Aren't we supposed
to be starting our lives?

282
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:12,186
- Did your mom tell you that?
- Yeah, my mom did tell me that.

283
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:14,271
- She did?
- Yeah. Why you hating on my mama?

284
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:17,066
No, it's just...
I mean, look around. OK?

285
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,318
In ten years, everyone in this
bar will be married with kids,

in a fucking minivan.

287
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:26,241
I mean, we got to do as much
crazy shit as we can before then.

288
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,078
No, yeah, exactly.
I totally agree.

289
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,831
We're not too big on crazy here,
are we?

290
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:36,168
What? No, I'm a huge
proponent of the crazy.

291
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:38,095
Are you kidding?
I'm the mayor of Crazyville.

292

- Oh, my God, you're such a dork.
- No! Are you...?

293
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:45,427
What? Check it. Look, V-neck
sweater with an un-tucked shirt.

294
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:48,138
- My shit is bananas, girl.
(LAUGHING)

295
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:51,558
(ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES)
- I'm just saying, the point is, is that

296
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,852
he's changed and I can tell
that you're upset by it.

297
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,396
- I'm not upset. I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

298
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,689
OK, whatever, message received.
I'm gonna talk to him.

299
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,400
- Dude, no.
- This can't go on. He's hurting you.

300
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,443
- He's hurting both of us.
- You don't need to talk to him.

- Fuck me!
MILLER: - That's awesome.

303
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,323
It went all the way through.
I can see it.

304
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,867
Oh, my God. Hey, hey...
Oh, my God, I am so sorry, man.

305
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,953
- I'm so sorry.
- Problem, homeboy?

- No, no. Here, let me take a look.
- Get your hands off me!

307
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,915
I'm gonna be a medical student.
I'll just check...

308
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,163
- Back off!
- Hey, hey, hey!

309

<i>- Step Up, 3D.</i> Take a step back.
- Miller, help me.

- You want to fight?
- Calm down. Nobody wants to dance, OK?

- It was an accident.
- Sorry, we won't touch you.

I met Jeff in my remedial
science study group,

to anyone else so...

First the gun and now this?

681

Why wouldn't he tell us
he was failing?

682
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:10,004
I don't know. Maybe he was
embarrassed or something.

We're his best friends. You tell
your best friends stuff like that.

like a campus address book,

688

might know where he lives?

No. Oh, wait,

1450
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:55,002
Oh, hey, dudes.
How was your night?

1451
01:10:55,169 --> 01:10:57,337
- Pretty terrible, actually.
- Tell me about it.

1452
01:10:57,504 --> 01:11:00,090
I ripped two sheets of LSD
and spent the whole night

1453
01:11:00,257 --> 01:11:02,593
dancing in front of my house again.

1454
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,553
Now I gotta go teach.

1455
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:11,518
Wait. Did The Chief just say

1456
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:13,765
he was dancing in front of his house
the whole night?

1457
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:15,564
- Yeah, so what?
- That's it!

1458
01:11:15,731 --> 01:11:17,171
- What's it?
- Oh, my God, that's it!

1459
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:18,317
What's it?
What are you talking about?

1460
01:11:18,484 --> 01:11:19,693
OK. So, the first time
we saw The Chief

1461
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,111
was in front
of Jeff Chang's place, right?

1462
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:22,988
And then we saw him
like nine more times.

1463
01:11:23,155 --> 01:11:25,532
Right, and we thought that he was
just wandering around campus all night,

1464
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:28,452
just like we were.
But what if he wasn't?

1465
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:32,247
What if The Chief was
in the exact same place the entire time?

1466
01:11:32,414 --> 01:11:35,542
Then that would mean we walked past
Jeff Chang's place a dozen times.

1467
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:37,510
- Oh, my God!
- Yes, and that's why Jeff Chang

1468
01:11:37,544 --> 01:11:38,670
kept mumbling those Indian chants.

1469
01:11:38,837 --> 01:11:40,547
It was because he was trying
to tell us where he lived.

1470

It's like <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>
except it makes sense.

where do you live?

here's what we gotta do.

get him showered and dressed

1602
01:17:32,566 --> 01:17:34,734
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, what do you mean?

1603
01:17:34,901 --> 01:17:37,737
I mean, like, I don't know
if I want go to med school

1604
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:39,739
or be a doctor or any of it.

1605

- Now you fucking tell us?
CASEY: - Miller, shut up.

1606
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:46,746
No, dude, are you serious?
I fucking kissed a guy for you!

1607
01:17:46,913 --> 01:17:47,914
- Miller!
- What?

1608
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:50,917
Yeah, I kissed Casey.
It was fucking gross.

1609
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:52,544
- Yeah.
- Miller, shut up.

1610
01:17:52,711 --> 01:17:53,871
- What?
CASEY: - Let him talk.

1611
01:17:53,879 --> 01:17:56,631
Look, I'm sort of losing
my shit up here.

1612
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:01,803
We heard that you tried to off yourself.

1613
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:04,222
- Miller, really?
- What?

1614
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:06,141
- Why'd you do it, man?
- I didn't.

1615
01:18:06,308 --> 01:18:09,853
- So then, what...?
- I mean, I did, sort of. I...

1616
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:12,772
I was up for 72 hours studying.
I was cracked out on pills.

1617
01:18:12,939 --> 01:18:15,192
I was literally
hallucinating in my room,

1618
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:17,027
but I didn't actually try to...

1619
01:18:17,194 --> 01:18:19,196
Right.
I do weird shit when I hallucinate too.

1620
01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:20,655
Yeah.

1621
01:18:21,907 --> 01:18:24,034
- You know?
- The doctors say I'm not suicidal.

1622
01:18:24,201 --> 01:18:26,578
They just think I'm fucking
stressed out of my mind.

1623
01:18:26,745 --> 01:18:28,496
- I mean, you guys know my dad.
- Yeah.

1624
01:18:28,663 --> 01:18:31,458
Yeah. He's been
riding me my whole life

1625
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:34,502
to go to med school and be
a doctor, but I hate medicine.

1626
01:18:34,669 --> 01:18:37,923
I suck in science.
I'm fucking miserable.

1627
01:18:38,089 --> 01:18:40,133
- So, don't do it.
- Yeah. Fuck it.

1628
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:43,136
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
- Oh, shit, he's here. What should I do?

1629
01:18:43,303 --> 01:18:45,423
Honestly, I think you
have to tell him the truth, man.

1630
01:18:45,472 --> 01:18:47,015
I think that's pretty obvious
to everybody in this room.

1631
01:18:47,182 --> 01:18:49,517
- You gotta tell him the truth.
- Oh, my God, you guys are so white.

1632

What?
Dude, that's really racist.

1633
01:18:51,603 --> 01:18:53,243
Yeah. White people
have feelings too, man.

1634
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:54,856
I can't just tell him the truth.

1635
01:18:55,023 --> 01:18:57,943
I come from like five generations
of doctors. I'm the first-born son.

Look, man, we're sorry that we stole
your truck, but like, calm down, man.

1653
01:19:41,236 --> 01:19:43,029
that we stole your truck
and your cell phone.

- What is it about? Is it about Nicole?
- Calm down!

1658
01:19:52,998 --> 01:19:54,799
Oh, my God, you didn't
even close with Nicole.

1659
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:56,358
Yeah, but I was really close,
right?

1660
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:58,044
No, there's no such thing as
almost fucking his girlfriend.

1661
01:19:58,211 --> 01:20:00,380
You either fucked his girlfriend
or you didn't.

1662
01:20:00,547 --> 01:20:02,132
- Stop talking, assholes!
- He didn't fuck your girlfriend!

1663
01:20:02,299 --> 01:20:03,717
- No, no, no, no.
- He didn't fuck your girlfriend!

1664

- That's what I'm saying.
- Is this a joke?

Then you've almost
fucked every girl you know.

1667

This is not about my truck
or my phone...

1668

...or... my... girl!

about the dart in the face.

Honestly, I completely forgot about
the dart in your face. Are you OK?

- He's had a really rough night too.
- Shut up!

- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

1679
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,797
- Who the fuck is this guy?
- Hey.

1680
01:20:42,964 --> 01:20:45,675
I'm Jeffrey's father.

Well, he's not going with you, so why
don't you just get the fuck outta here?

don't want to be a doctor right now.
