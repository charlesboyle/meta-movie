1
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:14,540
<i>In many ways, they'll
miss the good old days</i>

2
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:18,477
<i>Someday, someday</i>

3
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,549
<i>Yeah, it hurts to say
But I want you to stay</i>

4
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,753
<i>Sometimes, sometimes</i>

5
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,868
<i>Oh, my ex says I'm lacking in depth</i>

6
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,729
<i>I will do my best</i>

7
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,707
<i>You say you wanna stay by my side</i>

8
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:45,209
<i>Darlin', your head's not right</i>

9
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:49,775
<i>See, alone we stand
Together we fall apart</i>

10
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:54,288
<i>Yeah, I think I'll be all right</i>

11
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,650
- Hey, David.
- Hey, Joey.

12
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,558
Your brother's looking for you.

13
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,666
- Hey.
- Hey, David.

14
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,999
Where the hell were you?

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,267
- Did you take the truck home again?
- Yeah.

16
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,244
Pop asked you not to use the meat
truck for personal purposes.

17
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,273
- Hi, Mom.
- But you did it anyway?

18
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,375
Uh-huh.

19
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,543
- Do you have the jerseys for tonight?
- Yes.

20
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:28,351
No, no, no, seriously. Do you
have the jerseys for tonight?

21
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,160
- Yes. Yes, sweetheart, yes.
- Aleksy, hang up.

22
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,921
Yeah, sweetheart.

23
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,256
I should never have gotten
this woman pregnant.

24
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,158
Do not procreate, David.

25
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,862
Reproduction is a very bad idea.
Do not reproduce, ever.

26
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,599
Hey, I'm sorry.

27
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,443
To pay back some money that I owe,

28
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:52,547
I've built a little hydroponic
greenhouse in my apartment.

29
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,340
You're... You're growing pot?

30
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,421
And you're the only person
I know with a green thumb.

31
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,246
- And you want me to grow pot?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,081
Right. Absolutely.

33
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:05,851
That is the one thing missing for me
right now to achieve total happiness.

34
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,386
Getting into a drug ring.

35
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,755
Because the pressure of my wife
calling me every three minutes

36
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,492
because she's about to give birth to
my first child isn't intense enough.

37
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,694
How much do you owe?

38
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,074
- Eighty.
- "Eighty"?

39
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,969
- Eighty thousand.
- Eighty thousand?

40
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:24,748
When you say it with that face,
it does make it seem like a lot.

41
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,606
How do you get yourself into
these situations, David?

42
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,108
$80,000?

43
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,078
What happened?
How do you owe someone $80,000?

44
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,280
I borrowed money
to invest in Newtech.

45
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,450
- That is a pyramid scheme.
- It is not a pyramid scheme.

46
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,086
- The guy was arrested!
- Those charges were unrelated!

47
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,460
- He was arrested!
- David.

48
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,131
You know, David,
I love you like a son.

49
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,762
I am your son.

50
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,431
Which is why I love you like a son.

51
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,701
But if you don't have our new
jerseys for tonight's game...

52
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,972
I have the jerseys.

53
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,472
You gotta have the jerseys.
It's the team picture.

54
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,674
I have the jerseys.

55
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,021
He won't have the jerseys.

56
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,361
Come on, come on.

57
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,498
<i>Your loan has been denied.</i>

58
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,566
But if I don't get the $80,000,

59
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,402
there's people that are
gonna come and drown me.

60
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,304
Can you please put that
down on your little form,

61
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,306
that there's people that
are gonna come drown me?

62
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,475
<i>You do not have the
necessary collateral.</i>

63
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,410
That is why we're not
gonna give you any money.

64
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,613
Basically, then, you're just
a big goddamn pawn shop.

65
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,914
No, we're not a pawn shop.

66
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:45,017
You're a pawn shop
with fancy furniture.

67
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,087
And for all these reasons, I have
to turn down your application.

68
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,824
I'm very sorry.

69
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,796
All right. I understand.

70
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,231
This is a hold-up.

71
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:57,863
Excuse me?

72
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,805
I said, "All right. I understand."

73
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,835
This is a hold-up, asshole.

74
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,037
- Excuse me, you just said something.
- No.

75
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,912
- Just then, you said something.
- No.

76
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,379
I'm here. I'm David Wozniak.
I'm here to pick up my jerseys.

77
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,613
- I've been waiting for you.
- I know! I know!

78
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,148
I'm so sorry, but my
team photo is tonight.

79
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,317
The whole team has to have their
jerseys, it's for the whole year.

80
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,685
- All right already!
- Thank you so much.

81
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,024
I really do appreciate it.

82
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,596
Yes!

83
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,004
- A bag?
- No.

84
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,411
Rolling papers?

85
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,947
I grow tomatoes.

86
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,414
Hey! it's a delivery truck!
I'm making a delivery.

87
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,685
You're kidding me, right?

88
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,728
Yes. I swear I have the
jerseys, on our mother's...

89
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,556
Yes! On our mother's grave.

90
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:01,899
The jerseys are with me
in the truck as we speak.

91
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:07,441
Hey! Come on, stop! Hey! Hey!

92
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,378
You got my jerseys!

93
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,149
- I know it's late.
- Yes, it is.

94
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,117
But you brought me
such beautiful flowers.

95
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,612
I did.

96
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,924
And Mr. Bernstein takes
such great care of them.

97
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,695
Where have you been, David?

98
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,054
Emma, I'm sorry.

99
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:05,090
I was trying to pay back
some money that I owe.

100
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:09,795
I understand, but why
can't you call or text?

101
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,964
And why can't I come to
your apartment anymore?

102
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,701
I never said you couldn't
come to my place.

103
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,114
- Are you hiding something?
- Nothing.

104
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,677
You're sure you're not hiding
anything in your apartment.

105
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,379
Nope.

106
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,058
I'm pregnant.

107
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,201
That's great.

108
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,206
Yeah.

109
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,846
- Emma...
- No.

110
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,848
You know what? I can...

111
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,916
I can do this on my own.

112
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,841
What do you mean, "on your own"?

113
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,680
I want a child, okay?

114
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,379
But I don't want a father

115
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,348
who just disappears
because he gets too busy.

116
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,549
You're unreliable.

117
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,923
I mean, you've got...
You've got money problems.

118
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,655
You basically don't have a life.
This is not a life.

119
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,957
- I have a life.
- You don't have a life.

120
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,360
People who have a life do not
ring pregnant women's doorbells

121
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,561
at 3:00 in the morning.

122
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,196
I didn't know you were pregnant.

123
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,198
David, you would know.

124
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,608
If you just called me
every once in a while.

125
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,590
<i>I guess...</i>

126
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:43,193
I guess at first, for a
second there, I was in shock.

127
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,424
I mean, you know, it was a shock.

128
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,037
But then, you know, the...

129
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,607
That feeling of fear went away,
and I got this feeling

130
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,503
that this could be the most beautiful
thing that ever happened to me.

131
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,838
Stevie, no. Hey, Stevie, no!

132
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,174
Hey, it's 3:00 in the morning.
Go back to bed. Go back to bed.

133
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,375
Back to bed. Not in the sandbox.

134
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,210
Hey, where are you going?
No, don't go in the sandbox.

135
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,618
Not in the sandbox!

136
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,550
You gotta talk Emma into
getting an abortion.

137
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,918
- What?
- You have to.

138
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,887
How could you say such a thing?

139
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,289
How can you say stuff like that
in front of your children?

140
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,595
My children know that they're
too old to be aborted.

141
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,296
I'm realizing that
I might want a kid.

142
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,566
You are a free man.
You do not want kids.

143
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,268
Kids are a black hole.

144
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:33,806
They will suck up all of your energy,
your money, your time, your hair.

145
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,078
Remember when I had great hair?

146
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,277
I can't get it up anymore.

147
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,245
How can you talk like this
in front of your children?

148
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,048
I can say anything I want in front of my
children because they don't listen to me.

149
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,617
My children do not pick up on
the frequencies of my voice.

150
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,252
And I'm telling you,

151
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,297
I have a problem achieving
a full erection now.

152
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:53,861
It's not normal for a man of my age
to no longer have a nice, big erection.

153
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:57,329
Hey, what are you doing?
Listen to me, go back to bed.

154
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,630
Not in the sandbox.

155
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,368
Don't get in the sand.
Don't go in the sand!

156
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,237
- As your friend...
- Daddy?

157
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,739
No. No, no, no. Hey.

158
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,341
- Dad.
- Back to bed, honey.

159
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,476
Daddy.

160
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,778
I'm trying to have a conversation.
Please stop that.

161
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,788
- Daddy!
- Okay, stop that now.

162
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:19,129
I'm telling you, I think
I might want a kid.

163
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:22,228
As your friend and as your lawyer,
David, may I be brutally frank with you?

164
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,457
Sure.

165
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,897
You don't have the skills
to bring up a child.

166
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,873
I need order in my life.

167
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,579
And this is order?

168
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,540
I think this is beautiful.

169
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,708
Daddy!

170
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,606
David Wozniak.

171
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,741
Uh, the back door was
already broken into.

172
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,577
My name is Mark Williams.
I'm an attorney.

173
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:22,055
I've been trying to contact you
for several days now, Mr. Wozniak.

174
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,189
I do not have a great deal of time.

175
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,558
I shall be brief.

176
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,760
Between 1991 and 1994,

177
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:38,564
you donated sperm under
the pseudonym "Starbuck"

178
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,233
at the privately-owned
Graboski-Levitt Clinic,

179
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,436
which I represent.

180
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,070
No.

181
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,540
That was not a question,
it was a statement.

182
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,278
We have all the documents
necessary to prove it.

183
00:11:53,613 --> 00:12:00,059
Over the course of 33 months,
you were a very, very frequent donor.

184
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,955
You donated 693 times

185
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:08,902
in exchange for which you
received the sum of $24,255.

186
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,237
Your sperm is of a
very high quality.

187
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,236
Oh, thank you.

188
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,343
I'm sure your sperm
is also high-end.

189
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:18,904
Uh...

190
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:23,375
Certain complications arose,
which meant that for a period,

191
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,711
Mr. Graboski-Levitt gave your sperm

192
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:30,315
to all the women in his clientele.

193
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,885
You have sired 533 children

194
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,555
and 142 of them wish
to know your identity.

195
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,791
What?

196
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:43,334
You are the biological
father of 533 children.

197
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,600
At the time of each of
your multiple donations,

198
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,212
you signed a
confidentiality agreement.

199
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:54,882
Legally, the Graboski-Levitt Clinic is
obligated to protect your identity.

200
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,908
But a subset of your children

201
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,556
is contesting the legality
of those documents.

202
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,349
They wish to know who Starbuck is.

203
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,770
You say that for each of
the 693 sperm donations

204
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:28,373
you signed a confidentiality agreement
under the pseudonym of "Starbuck"?

205
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,508
Every time. Always.

206
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,877
I always signed the
confidentially agreement, always.

207
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,445
And you signed those documents

208
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,014
before or after executing
the manual labor?

209
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,115
Before.

210
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,351
And you always wrestled
the dragon alone?

211
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,452
Yes.

212
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,788
Frankly, I'm disappointed you
never told me about any of this.

213
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,057
Usually you call up your
friends after you get laid,

214
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,825
not after you wrestle
the dragon alone.

215
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,527
But if you absolutely insist,

216
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:52,497
I promise you I will phone you
every single time I fly solo.

217
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,901
That's an interesting offer.
Unfortunately, way too time-consuming.

218
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:59,671
Listen, they claim that your right
to privacy should take a back seat

219
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,183
to their basic human right to know
who their biological father is.

220
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:09,388
It's very complex.
Very, very complex.

221
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,920
It's...

222
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,984
It's really complex.

223
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,321
Do you know that this is
the dream of every lawyer

224
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,657
to argue a case this significant?

225
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:22,305
A case that will leave its mark?
That will stand as a precedent?

226
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,497
My mother always said that
I would never amount to anything.

227
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,076
- I'll show that old bitch.
- What do we do now?

228
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:32,036
As your lawyer, I suggest you
cease masturbating in fertility clinics.

229
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,873
- Do I have to get a real lawyer?
- You can't afford a real lawyer.

230
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,743
I'm gonna call the Bar Association
today, reactivate my license.

231
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:38,910
You don't have a license?

232
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,213
I lost it because of
a small formality.

233
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:46,084
Something about a missing dated
form and a bribe. It's nothing.

234
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,855
Oh! Yes, in hopes of persuading
Starbuck to meet with them,

235
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:53,503
142 of the children in your lawsuit
want you to know who they are.

236
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,832
This envelope contains the
profiles of 142 of your children.

237
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,507
Do not open it!

238
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,322
Brett.

239
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,519
Hey, Starbuck.

240
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,188
Don't call me that.
Can Susan take the kids?

241
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,423
When she's not investing all
her energy in her new career,

242
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,626
she prefers to wisely use her time
sleeping with men I don't like.

243
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,861
Do you have a babysitter?

244
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,262
Why, you need someone to
watch over that envelope?

245
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,630
I know I shouldn't have,
but I've opened it.

246
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,932
Worst idea ever.

247
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,167
I picked out one of the profiles.
I just picked one.

248
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,536
One. Do you know whose
profile I picked?

249
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,307
Andrew Johansson.

250
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,713
We got to go.

251
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,899
What do you got?

252
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,875
- $225
- $200,

253
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,047
There he is.

254
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,581
Let's go, baby. Take it. Take it.

255
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:06,136
Come on, 13! Let's go, 13!
Come on, Johansson.

256
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,133
13 is wide open! Let's go!

257
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,466
Yeah!

258
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,104
<i>Andrew Johansson with the three.</i>

259
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,240
Play defense, play defense,
play defense!

260
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,210
Play defense, play defense! Yes!
Do you see him? Do you see him?

261
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,945
He stopped it, he blocked it.
He got right in the lane.

262
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:29,047
Did you see him get in the lane?
Did you see 13 get in the lane?

263
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,181
We got 13, guys.

264
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,451
Why don't they put him in?
Why don't they put him in?

265
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,120
The game's almost over.

266
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,891
Why are they not...
They put him in!

267
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,968
<i>Andrew Johansson.</i>

268
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,593
Thirteen seconds.

269
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,094
Okay, set up. He's open,
he's open, he's open.

270
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,796
Hit him, hit him, hit him!

271
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,431
Pass it to 13! Pass it to 13!

272
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,300
Why won't they give it to 13?
Give it to him!

273
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:51,570
He's open! Catch it.
Got it, got it, got it!

274
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,414
Andrew! Andrew! Andrew!

275
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,856
Andrew! Andrew!

276
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,989
<i>Those were my genes.</i>

277
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,825
My genes were on a professional
basketball court tonight!

278
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,229
In a way, you could say that
that was an extension of myself

279
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,467
that hit that game-winning shot!

280
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,734
I mean, do your kids play
professional basketball?

281
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,736
No, not to my knowledge.
But I will inquire.

282
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:25,972
They don't tell me everything.

283
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,184
So, I've been thinking that
we could plead insanity.

284
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,353
- What?
- I don't know.

285
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,181
Maybe you would not
be held responsible

286
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,988
for actions taken while
mentally unstable.

287
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,358
We could bank on your
mental problems.

288
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,367
I don't have mental problems.

289
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,427
I don't have mental problems!

290
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,197
When we're in court, I want you
to say it exactly that way.

291
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:54,674
One, two, three, Wozniak!

292
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,579
Let's go.

293
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,037
Come on! One, two.
One, two. One two.

294
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:01,139
Big time, big time, big time!

295
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,674
Let's play some basketball.

296
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,183
Come in. Back up, back up!

297
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,611
Hurry up! Come up, up, up!

298
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,132
- Are you allowed to hit the arm?
- No.

299
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,814
Okay. Pick and roll!

300
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,817
Let's go! Back, back,
back! D, D, D!

301
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,653
Great steal! Here we go, hit me!

302
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,022
I'm going in for the jam.
Okay, not a jam.

303
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,190
What the hell position
is he playing?

304
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,428
A little help? Thank you.

305
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,364
All right. Why don't we
meet up back here at two?

306
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,600
Emma!

307
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,040
Uh...

308
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,681
Give me a second?

309
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,379
I have officially
decided to have a life.

310
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,179
I'm at work.

311
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,726
I'm going to convince you that
I deserve to be this kid's father.

312
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,533
I'm sorry, excuse me.

313
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:08,773
Four days in a row,
I have not had any sleep.

314
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,742
But I've never been
so happy in my life.

315
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,611
I never thought that I would
love anyone that much.

316
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:17,615
The kid poops four times a day
and I think I'm losing my mind.

317
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,296
I think I'm going crazy,
because I swear

318
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,288
his diapers make me so proud.

319
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,390
I'm totally convinced that my child

320
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,625
takes way better dumps
than any other kid.

321
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,260
Your brother wants parental leave

322
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,097
so he can spend more time
admiring his son's diapers.

323
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,399
It's the law, okay?
I'm entitled to parental leave.

324
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,802
I had three kids, and two hours
after each of them was born,

325
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,138
I was here, serving customers.

326
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:43,513
You absolutely have
to have kids, David.

327
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,614
What?

328
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,487
My girlfriends pregnant.

329
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,418
You got a girlfriend?

330
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,618
Yeah.

331
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,959
David, you're gonna love it.
You are gonna love it.

332
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,390
Your kid is never gonna
poop as good as my kid,

333
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,226
but you are gonna love it.

334
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,997
- Can you believe that?
- No.

335
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,893
I promise, I will
only be gone an hour.

336
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:29,462
No, I won't. Look,
I've called everyone.

337
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,229
How many times have
I covered for you?

338
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,963
Oh, my God, man.

339
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,331
I'm begging you, man.

340
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,376
I really, really need
you to do this for me.

341
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,580
I can't even talk to you.

342
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:50,976
Yeah?

343
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:54,891
Can I help you?

344
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:01,363
I'll have a espresso to go, please.

345
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:17,575
I said "to go."

346
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,794
Is there a lid?

347
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,691
Do you have a lid?

348
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:36,623
Usually, you get a lid when
you order a coffee to go.

349
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,642
$3.25.

350
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,312
You could be a bit more polite.

351
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,709
Polite?

352
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,177
I'm a customer.

353
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:00,845
You're a barista.

354
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:04,449
Would it be possible to
act in a polite manner?

355
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,717
What the hell are
you talking about?

356
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:09,354
I'm talking about a little
"please" and "thank you."

357
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:11,890
- A little thank you.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

358
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,766
Is that not considered cool
by your generation anymore?

359
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,363
Who the hell are you, man?

360
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:20,698
I'm just saying if you
smiled a little more,

361
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,700
maybe there would be
more people in here.

362
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,968
If you want to be a waiter...

363
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,904
Well, there's the thing.
I don't want to be a waiter.

364
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,277
I'm an actor.

365
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,975
I am an actor missing the opportunity
of a lifetime right now.

366
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,778
And you, because you give me
three bucks and a quarter,

367
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,458
you want me to smile?

368
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:39,627
You want me to smile when I am
totally pissing away my life?

369
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,157
It doesn't have to be a big smile.

370
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,426
Okay.

371
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,101
Have a nice day.

372
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,731
Good afternoon.

373
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,730
I'll take care of the coffee shop.

374
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,031
Yes or no?

375
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,868
Customers come in sometimes.

376
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,338
It isn't always empty.
I can't leave you with the shop.

377
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:35,006
But it's the role of a lifetime.

378
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,881
Yeah, and how do I know you won't
just walk off with the cash?

379
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,724
You can leave with my
truck full of meat.

380
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,092
And why would you do this?

381
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,357
Satisfaction of knowing
that you helped someone

382
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:54,333
make something of themself.

383
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,604
Bring it back without a scratch.

384
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,973
Okay. People might come in.

385
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,343
I can figure out how to
make a cup of coffee.

386
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,423
All right. Okay.

387
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,221
Thanks.

388
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:29,060
<i>It is total chaos in the
meat market today, David.</i>

389
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:31,729
And you decide to disappear?

390
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,431
In the whole family business,

391
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,767
<i>you know you've got
the easiest job, right?</i>

392
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:41,077
<i>And in spite of having the simplest job,
you manage to do the job badly!</i>

393
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,674
It's like every day you find a new way

394
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,082
to push back the frontiers
of incompetence!

395
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,714
<i>There are only two components
to your chosen occupation.</i>

396
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,050
<i>Get meat, deliver meat.</i>

397
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,286
That's not what I ordered.

398
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:54,619
It's free.

399
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,287
Take it, it's free.

400
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,257
<i>You're no longer a "deliverer."
You're more of a "keeper."</i>

401
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:02,026
Why is our truck still
full of meat? Why?

402
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:05,470
Why have you only taken
our meat out for a drive?

403
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,765
- Yeah?
- I'll have...

404
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,310
Tell me who you are
before I call the cops.

405
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,108
I'm the waiter.

406
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,749
I'm the owner.

407
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,519
I do the hiring here.

408
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:25,083
Josh got called in for the
audition of a lifetime.

409
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,594
Fine. He can look for
another job, then.

410
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,054
Sir, it was the
audition of a lifetime.

411
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,859
That's not the problem.

412
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:33,991
What's the problem?

413
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,661
He's not a good actor.
He has never been cast.

414
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:37,762
Never.

415
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,034
He's a good kid,
but he's wasting his life.

416
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,539
He's fired.

417
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,504
Look, this whole thing was my idea.

418
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:48,445
So, I guess it's your fault
if he can't pay his rent.

419
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,577
I lost my job?

420
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,842
You lost your job.

421
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,081
I got the part.

422
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,180
You got the part?

423
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:31,258
Yeah, they loved me.

424
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,184
You got the part?

425
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,262
As of today, I'm an actor.

426
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,655
Congratulations, man!
- Thanks.

427
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,858
Thanks, man. Thanks.

428
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,833
Wow!

429
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,580
I knew it! I knew you
were gonna bail on me.

430
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,572
How the hell am I
supposed to pay the rent?

431
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,077
Okay, wait. No, no, wait! Wait!

432
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,947
The cash is on the table.
I'm four dollars short.

433
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,889
Peter, you owe me money.

434
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:41,219
No, you owe me money!

435
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,060
Okay, so then, what are
you gonna do about it?

436
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,090
You told me June.

437
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,859
Tell me, what am I
supposed to do now, huh?

438
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,862
Tell me!
What am I supposed to do now?

439
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,104
Miss, don't worry about the money.

440
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,650
You, uh, won your pizza.

441
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,311
Yeah, you won the contest.

442
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,747
You won our, uh...

443
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,950
You won our "Eat and Win" contest.

444
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,253
I don't know what you want,
but this is not a good time.

445
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,422
I'm not doing too well right now,
so can you leave my apartment?

446
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,693
Yes.

447
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,030
Yes, absolutely.

448
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:27,164
I'm about to call the police!

449
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:30,209
No. No need for that at all.

450
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:34,405
It's only that I can see that
you're not doing very well,

451
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:38,242
and we have a policy

452
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:42,113
that's very, very, very strict

453
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,818
in the condition in which
we can leave our customers.

454
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,221
Here at...

455
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:54,669
At Rocco's Pizzeria, we believe
in a more humane pizza.

456
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:57,673
So, is everything okay?

457
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,907
Miss?

458
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,653
Shit!

459
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:27,725
Okay, okay, you're okay, you're okay.
You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.

460
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,449
Miss. Miss!

461
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,354
- Kristen?
- Miss!

462
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,015
Let go of me!

463
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,287
Kristen! Kristen!

464
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,123
Excuse me, and who are you?

465
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,970
Are you ashamed to say
you're my father?

466
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,307
No.

467
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:15,641
May I have a word with you?

468
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:21,049
Yes.

469
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,185
The good news is
that for the moment,

470
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:31,789
we just happen to have a spot
open in our rehab program.

471
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,258
The bad news is that your daughter

472
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,167
seems totally uninterested
in the program.

473
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,635
Since she is still a minor,
it's your decision.

474
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,136
- I'm not...
- It's a very good program.

475
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,578
We've gotten great results.

476
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,816
I'll talk to her.

477
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:02,021
Hi.

478
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,288
How are you?

479
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,298
Please sign the release.

480
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:10,106
Look, I don't know
who you are, but...

481
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:13,702
I'm begging you, sign the papers.

482
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,174
- They have a great program here.
- I can stop on my own.

483
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:20,270
I mean, I just had the
scare of my life!

484
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,107
- Please sign the papers.
- I think the program is...

485
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,843
No, if I do the program then
I'm gonna be surrounded

486
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:28,650
24 hours a day by addicts.

487
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,521
And I guarantee, I will relapse.

488
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:36,063
People don't stop using
in these programs.

489
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,699
They stop when they wanna stop.

490
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:41,900
- They will help you.
- They'll lock me up.

491
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:46,197
And I'll lose my job. I just...

492
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,832
I just got this great job

493
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,912
and I have nothing in my
life besides this job.

494
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,977
- I'll talk to the...
- Thank you.

495
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:11,993
I'm going to sign the release.

496
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,163
Worst decision that
you'll ever make.

497
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,328
She says she'll be happy.

498
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,600
Right now she doesn't
need to be happy.

499
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,935
She needs to stop using.

500
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,044
And she will.

501
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,174
Do you love your daughter?

502
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,039
I do.

503
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,009
Tell her. Go tell her
that you love her.

504
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,215
And tell her that you will
not sign that release.

505
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,271
Where do you work?

506
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,567
Bloomingdale's.

507
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:58,402
- You're okay for tonight?
- Yes.

508
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,739
- And you got my number.
- Yeah.

509
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,708
- Great. You start work tomorrow at...
- 8:00.

510
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,877
- Okay. And you'll be there at 8:00?
- 8:00.

511
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,648
Okay.

512
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,924
Well...

513
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,618
In my life, I have a tendency

514
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:20,167
to make very, very,
very bad decisions.

515
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:26,105
Tell me that I haven't just
made another wrong decision.

516
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,505
You haven't.

517
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,004
Thanks.

518
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,885
Oh, man.

519
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,310
Yes.

520
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,483
Yes!

521
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,183
Thank you, thank you. Yes!

522
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,385
Whoo!

523
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,659
<i>Wonderful</i>

524
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,530
<i>Glorious</i>

525
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:09,841
<i>The sum of all your experiences</i>

526
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:13,409
<i>A living breathing
result of the fight</i>

527
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:17,908
<i>And every night you spent
shrouded in darkness</i>

528
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:22,387
<i>Has led you to this moment in the light
It's all right</i>

529
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,383
<i>Wonderful</i>

530
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:29,354
<i>Glorious</i>

531
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,424
I've never even tried that.

532
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,426
When you do it, it's different
than regular Pilates?

533
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:37,861
That is why notable
notorious Americans,

534
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,931
such as Roger Morris,
George Washington,

535
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,476
Eliza Jumel and Aaron Burr...

536
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,241
I'm a writer, too. I like to write.

537
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,603
- Oh, that's awesome.
- Yeah, yeah.

538
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,892
- You hold me still.
- Taxi!

539
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,494
All right.

540
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,658
Yeah.

541
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,063
Grab my hand.

542
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,143
- Just watch me dance.
- Okay.

543
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,009
Here, just take it.

544
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,749
Wow! Okay, thanks!

545
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,818
How about hitting this guy up?

546
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,754
Yeah! Do you feel that?

547
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,265
...have all called the
Morris-Jumel Mansion "home."

548
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,801
- Nice!
- Thank you.

549
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,627
- Exciting.
- Thank you.

550
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,807
It's all right.

551
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,709
No, no. Okay.

552
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,208
Okay, okay!

553
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:01,215
<i>My love is beautiful
It's here for the taking</i>

554
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,516
<i>It's strong and pure and
utterly earth-shaking</i>

555
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:08,630
<i>My love has brought me
here to show you it's true</i>

556
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:13,024
<i>A wretch like me
You'll make it through</i>

557
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,528
Hey, come on, buddy,

558
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,409
what are you doing?
You never see a girl before?

559
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:20,798
Wow.

560
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,534
Honestly, really?
Just keep walking.

561
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:26,011
That's what I'm talking about.
Hey, Shorty!

562
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,204
Hello, Ice Queen!

563
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:29,206
Hey, Ice Queen,
I need a hand over here.

564
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,977
Hey, I need a hand right here!

565
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,810
Oh!

566
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,422
Did you say "Ice Queen"?

567
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,381
- Did you actually say "Ice Queen"?
- Yeah.

568
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,149
Don't say that!

569
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,023
Don't say stuff like that!

570
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:42,693
All right.

571
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:47,433
...all called the Roger
Morris-Jumel Mansion "home."

572
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:55,465
Oh! Yeah! Yeah!
Was that unbelievable? Unbelievable!

573
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:56,838
Don't forget the money, guys.

574
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,273
<i>And everything became clear.</i>

575
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,806
I had kind of an epiphany.

576
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:06,743
I cannot be the father
of 533 children.

577
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,184
It's not possible.

578
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:11,915
It is impossible to be the
father of 533 children.

579
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,351
It is impossible to be the
father of four children.

580
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,795
Right! Exactly. It's impossible.

581
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:21,633
But I can be their guardian angel.

582
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,361
Their guardian angel?

583
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,164
They need me.
They need a guardian angel.

584
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:29,766
They need someone to
look out for them.

585
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:33,837
And I fathered them,
so it's my responsibility.

586
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:37,608
So, you're telling me that your
purpose on Earth is to look out for,

587
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:41,712
like a superhero, 533 children.

588
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,213
I didn't say "superhero."

589
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,348
Out of curiosity,

590
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,183
when you're looking out
for these children,

591
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,551
will you be wearing
any kind of cape?

592
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,786
I didn't say "superhero?
I said "guardian angel."

593
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,123
So, no cape, but you will
have wings and play the harp.

594
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:56,096
I'm starting to feel more and more
comfortable with this insanity plea.

595
00:39:56,294 --> 00:40:00,169
I do not have mental problems.

596
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,173
Say it exactly like
that to the judge.

597
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,008
Thanks.

598
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:12,844
Hey, there.

599
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:17,483
So, today is the first ultrasound.

600
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:21,522
David, look, I need...
I need a friend.

601
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,254
- I'm a friend.
- I want that to be clear.

602
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,489
It's clear.

603
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,990
Okay, well, let's get going.

604
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,325
I drank a gallon of water

605
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:30,699
and I'm not allowed lo pee
before the ultrasound.

606
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:41,838
- So, is that the leg there?
- That is.

607
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,507
Which one? Which one's the leg?

608
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:45,008
The white spot that you see.

609
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,511
- And is that the head up high?
- That is the head up high.

610
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:49,817
- Okay.
- And we're gonna see the arm.

611
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,749
- That's amazing.
- Isn't it?

612
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,184
So, now all the organs are okay?

613
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,953
Yep. Perfect.

614
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:59,328
I just passed by the baby's head.
And there's the belly.

615
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,525
My God, do you see the belly?

616
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,627
And there's the whole baby.

617
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,239
That's incredible.

618
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:08,404
David, I'm not sure.

619
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,368
Not sure of what?

620
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:13,810
Look at them. They're monsters.

621
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,874
I mean, look at that one.
Look at him.

622
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,852
Emma.

623
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:22,848
This is the most absolute beautiful
thing that can happen to anyone.

624
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:25,048
Who are you? The Dalai Lama?

625
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,819
What do you mean,
"the most beautiful thing"?

626
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,987
And look at that one.
He's eating his own booger.

627
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,861
It's a great source of protein.

628
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,424
Listen.

629
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:38,663
You are going to be a good mother.

630
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,407
So, herds what.

631
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:54,351
Since I absolutely do
not trust you at all...

632
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:58,815
What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna declare you the father.

633
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,150
- Yes!
- No, David, wait.

634
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,422
I'm gonna declare you the
father on probation.

635
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:06,767
- "Father on probation"?
- Yeah. You get no slack.

636
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,759
For how long?

637
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,633
Forever.

638
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:14,598
Will our child have to call me
"Daddy On Probation"?

639
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,732
No.

640
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,035
Will I have to wear a uniform

641
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:21,410
that will separate me
from the regular daddies?

642
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,720
- No.
- Then, I accept.

643
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,178
We're having a kid.
We're having a kid!

644
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,483
Yes.

645
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,162
<i>Your name?</i>

646
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,832
- Earl Monroe.
- And you are?

647
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,739
A friend.

648
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,688
He's over there.

649
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,360
Great.

650
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:11,925
Thank you.

651
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,960
You're not going to visit with him?

652
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:16,971
No. I...

653
00:43:17,495 --> 00:43:20,869
I just wanted to stop
by and see him, and...

654
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:24,542
- Well, now I have, so...
- He would really enjoy it.

655
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,342
Yeah, but...

656
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:35,820
Don't worry, just say
whatever comes to mind.

657
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,167
Hey, Ryan.

658
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,493
One, two, three.

659
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:40,779
Earl Monroe.

660
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,119
You did good.

661
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:50,030
I said nothing the whole time.

662
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,561
I couldn't get a word out.

663
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,794
You were there.
You did really good.

664
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:00,535
Okay.

665
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:02,803
Great.

666
00:45:22,787 --> 00:45:25,956
<i>In Athabasca, we set a fire</i>

667
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:29,161
<i>To the world we left far behind</i>

668
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,999
<i>All the faces, we put away</i>

669
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:35,407
<i>Lost lives float into space</i>

670
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,303
<i>I got a message, I got a sign</i>

671
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,805
<i>Through the wires swinging in time</i>

672
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:45,078
<i>It's so simple, it's like the sun</i>

673
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:48,256
<i>Shines down on everyone</i>

674
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,354
<i>Black bird, from the blue</i>

675
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:54,525
<i>I give my love to get used</i>

676
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,966
<i>Our hopes come true</i>

677
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,361
Sabrina!

678
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:01,891
Hi. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

679
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,503
- You are late.
- I know, I'm sorry.

680
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:15,941
Thank you very much.

681
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:28,488
Excuse me.

682
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:30,727
Sorry.

683
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,731
Excuse me.

684
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,937
Look, if we really want
to find out who Starbuck is,

685
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:50,106
we need these guys to help
us put together the strategy

686
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,042
to make sure that this thing
doesn't turn into a circus.

687
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:54,978
- We don't have the money.
- We can do it on our own.

688
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,881
The objective wouldn't be
to always have them there.

689
00:46:57,882 --> 00:47:01,651
I think if we just take the time to
check out what they've proposed...

690
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,486
I simply wanted to express the fact

691
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,758
that I feel we were
better off without them.

692
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:39,234
Yes, gentleman in the blue.

693
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,595
Do you have a comment?

694
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,973
I just want to say that...

695
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,386
I don't know all of you here.

696
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:03,219
But...

697
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:08,559
But you're all focused, a lot,

698
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:13,091
on finding Starbuck.

699
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,769
But, whatever happens,

700
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:20,007
you're all brothers and sisters.

701
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,977
You've all found one another.

702
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,720
- Hey!
- Hey!

703
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:45,298
- Hi.
- Hi.

704
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:48,330
What are you doing here?

705
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:50,935
I'm... Yeah... You know, I'm...

706
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:52,829
I'm the father.

707
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:56,671
I'm the adoptive father.
I'm Ryan's adoptive father.

708
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,668
- Ryan?
- He's not here tonight.

709
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,137
He's at a home for the disabled.

710
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,477
He's disabled,
and he just couldn't make it.

711
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,616
- Hey!
- Hey.

712
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,347
Kristen. This is...

713
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:10,313
- Taylor.
- Yeah. Taylor saved my life.

714
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:13,483
He saved my life at the pool.
He's a lifeguard.

715
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:16,820
And I'm the adoptive
father of Ryan,

716
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:20,023
and he couldn't be here,
because he's handicapped.

717
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:21,324
You're the father of
one of the children?

718
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,459
- Adoptive.
- Oh, wow.

719
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,901
- How's it going?
- Hey, hey, hey, Josh!

720
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,069
Yeah.

721
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,898
Josh, this is Taylor,
and this is Kristen.

722
00:49:31,924 --> 00:49:33,169
How's it going?

723
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:36,306
Josh worked at a coffee shop,
and he is now an actor.

724
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:37,874
Josh, this is Taylor.

725
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:40,210
Taylor is a lifeguard.
He saved my life a few months ago.

726
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:42,979
And this is Kristen. Orders pizza.
She is also an ex-drug addict.

727
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,181
And I'm the adoptive father

728
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,517
of a young disabled man
who couldn't be here.

729
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:48,685
And his name is Ryan.

730
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:50,520
Hey, you're the guy from the park.

731
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:51,988
- Hey.
- How are you?

732
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,259
Great.

733
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,059
Josh, Kristen and Taylor.

734
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,193
- Hey.
- How are you?

735
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:58,498
What's up? Adam.

736
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:02,165
Kristen has got a great job,
and she's still...

737
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,867
Yep, I'm still working
at Bloomingdale's.

738
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:05,635
So the job, which is great.
Everyone's doing great.

739
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:08,671
And I'm the adoptive
father of a disabled...

740
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,215
Young disabled man.

741
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:13,076
Ryan, who was obviously...

742
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:16,679
Unfortunately, was in conflict
with some of the disabled days

743
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,882
of doing the activities and
stuff that we're involved in.

744
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:21,417
So, I got the stuff for him.
I gotta run out of here.

745
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,757
But everyone looks good.

746
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,967
- Good to see you.
- Great. Great to see you.

747
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,035
Taxi!

748
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:43,039
As of tonight, you are officially part of
a mass action lawsuit against yourself.

749
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,480
What the hell are you doing here?

750
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:48,177
A bit of reconnaissance work.
What the hell are you doing here?

751
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:49,746
I was following one of my kids...

752
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:52,549
But why are you doing this?
Who does things like that?

753
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,217
I don't know, I was curious.

754
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,418
- Stop!
- Stop what?

755
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,387
Stop everything for
the rest of your life.

756
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,422
Every time you have an idea,
I want you to come to me,

757
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:02,125
and as your friend,
I will shoot your idea down.

758
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:03,626
You're not a normal person, David.

759
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,295
I am a normal person.

760
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:07,230
David, we've known each
other for 20 years.

761
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,232
I can tell you for a fact,
you are not normal.

762
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:10,567
I'm very normal.

763
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,701
Really?

764
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,369
- What about Mariouka?
- I don't see the point...

765
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,604
Five years ago,

766
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:16,539
you married a Russian woman
that you had never met.

767
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,874
She needed to get into the country,

768
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:20,376
and she promised to clean
my apartment for a year.

769
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:23,114
And she disappeared after three
days with her real husband.

770
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:26,816
David, how much money did you
lose importing Cuban cigars?

771
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:28,318
That guy looked very honest.

772
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,286
He was in his bathing suit!

773
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:34,697
Since when does anybody do business
with a man in his bathing suit?

774
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:44,300
Listen, for the first time in my life,
I think I'm doing the right thing.

775
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:45,622
You're not doing the right thing.

776
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,549
Stop seeing your kids!

777
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,906
Where's our money?

778
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:21,240
I'll get it! I said I'll get it.

779
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,413
<i>It's now $ 100,000.</i>

780
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:29,988
So, I really need you
to lend me some cash.

781
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:35,429
Tony. It's David. Yeah...

782
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:38,360
Hello?

783
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:41,563
Phil! Buddy, how are you?

784
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:43,994
Rob!

785
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,403
Nelson!

786
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:49,942
All right, don't worry, man.
I understand.

787
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:53,443
No, no. I'll catch you soon.

788
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,130
Hello, David Wozniak.

789
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,536
All the profiles.

790
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:28,913
And I saw on your overdue bills
that your name is David Wozniak.

791
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:32,112
I was sitting behind
you at the hotel.

792
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,589
My name is Viggo.

793
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,087
I'm your biological son.

794
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,225
Are you gonna expose me?

795
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,991
I don't know.

796
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:50,671
I don't even really know why
I ever wanted to meet you.

797
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,175
Who are you?

798
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:57,602
What do you do for a living?

799
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:00,112
I work at a meat store.

800
00:54:01,138 --> 00:54:02,578
I'm a vegetarian.

801
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:06,988
So, you murder animals.

802
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:09,584
No. I deliver the meat.

803
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,153
I don't murder it.

804
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:14,428
I chauffeur it around.

805
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:16,319
Leo Tolstoy says that,

806
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,588
"If a man earnestly
seeks a righteous life,

807
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,599
"his first act of abstinence
is from animal food."

808
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:23,926
I did not know that.

809
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,228
Sir Thomas More said,

810
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:27,930
"The Utopians feel that
slaughtering our fellow creatures

811
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,266
"gradually destroys the
sense of compassion

812
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,641
"which is the finest sentiment of
which our human nature is capable."

813
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,713
That's interesting.

814
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:43,386
Can we keep this our secret?

815
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:46,991
Can I stay here a few days?

816
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,892
I need to get to know you.

817
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:53,956
It has only been two weeks,
and he has become unbearable.

818
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,925
Again this morning,
he called me three times.

819
00:54:55,926 --> 00:54:58,795
That's three times this morning.
He's taking up all of my time.

820
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:01,030
Do whatever he wants.
We can't let him expose you.

821
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,733
Long conversations.

822
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,435
Long, like police interrogations.
He feels the need to bond.

823
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,371
Do whatever he wants,
or he will expose you.

824
00:55:08,372 --> 00:55:13,476
He wants to point out books that
are so dense and so esoteric

825
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:16,512
that it's impossible to
make heads or tails of it.

826
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,482
And then he'll twist it and
ask if I agree with it,

827
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:22,351
and then, he'll use it to prove
that somehow I'm full of shit.

828
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,854
I'm not having conversations
with him, Brett.

829
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:27,223
I'm in a chess game that
I don't realize that I'm in.

830
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:30,200
And it's exhausting. It's draining.

831
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,129
No.

832
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,530
- Answer it.
- No!

833
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:38,110
You have to answer it.
Anything he wants.

834
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:41,404
<i>- Hey, I got you a kale salad.</i>
- You got me a what?

835
00:55:41,405 --> 00:55:42,738
Kale salad.

836
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,509
I'm kidding.

837
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:47,910
I got you a triple monster burger.

838
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:49,579
Yes, please.

839
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,521
Hey, should you be
painting like this?

840
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:53,549
Because I can do this.

841
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,923
I can do the painting.
I'm happy to do it.

842
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:00,298
Thank you for being here.

843
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,158
I'm glad I'm here.

844
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:04,427
- But I'm excited to do the painting.
- Yeah?

845
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:05,895
From now on,
let me do the painting.

846
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:07,263
- All right.
- Okay.

847
00:56:07,264 --> 00:56:09,098
I got you some French fries.

848
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,601
- You got French fries, too?
- Yes.

849
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:13,269
And there might be
something else in there.

850
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,670
Really?

851
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,441
A little treat?

852
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:19,983
You got me two burgers!

853
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,912
So, I'm trying to cancel
tomorrow night with Emma

854
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:25,848
and I think I can get off a bit early,
so we can do whatever.

855
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,618
Whatever you want. Tomorrow
night will be Viggo's choice.

856
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:30,230
All right, I'm off.

857
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,497
Good game, David.

858
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,605
Everything okay?

859
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,665
Yeah.

860
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:45,836
You want to play?

861
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,909
Yeah!

862
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:52,349
All right. Come on,
get your stuff. Let's go.

863
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:56,112
We gotta hurry.
Careful, careful, careful.

864
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:57,813
Do you have any
sweatpants, or anything?

865
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:59,315
No.

866
00:56:59,316 --> 00:57:01,550
You don't want to wear that stuff.
It's not a nightclub, Viggo.

867
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:02,818
Do you have any shorts for me?

868
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,499
I don't think my shorts
are gonna fit you.

869
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:10,632
Like this.

870
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:13,336
What?

871
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:18,175
Up there.

872
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:21,070
Dribble, dribble, dribble.

873
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:22,773
Oh' my...

874
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,674
You just gotta dribble.
You gotta dribble.

875
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:26,175
So, you just... You just dribble.

876
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,879
Dribble, dribble! You gotta dribble!
You gotta...

877
00:57:32,082 --> 00:57:34,284
Why doesn't he dribble?

878
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:39,855
David, you absolutely have
to be there next Saturday.

879
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,865
Everybody's gonna be there.

880
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:44,927
Actually, I have plans
next Saturday with Emma.

881
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:47,430
But you were the one who came
up with this whole concept

882
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:49,872
of brothers and sisters
finding one another.

883
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:53,207
Yeah, I understand, but I
already have plans with Emma.

884
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:56,912
Anyway, I spend a heck
of a lot of time with you.

885
00:57:57,274 --> 00:57:59,886
You know, I also
have a real family.

886
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:05,749
Family.

887
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,586
You said "real family."

888
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:10,186
- No.
- You... You...

889
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:12,521
Just because you
decided to turn the page

890
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:16,226
on that period of your life
doesn't mean we don't exist.

891
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:20,838
We exist. We exist for real.
We're also your real family.

892
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:25,709
Viggo.

893
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:28,211
Viggo!

894
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,979
All I'm saying is,
I hope that you're happy.

895
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:40,082
I hope you realize that I had
to lie to Emma to be here.

896
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,351
That I lied to the woman
carrying my child.

897
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,886
Your "real" child.

898
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:46,422
Viggo, we have talked
about the incident a lot.

899
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:49,725
I don't think we need to continue to
dwell on our little misunderstanding.

900
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:52,964
I am here.
Do you see that I'm here?

901
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:54,497
Do you see that I am here?

902
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:56,832
- With your fake kids.
- Fake?

903
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,834
Fake? Viggo, what the hell
are you talking about?

904
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:01,070
I mean, if we're not real,
what are we?

905
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:03,339
- Nietzsche said...
- Screw Nietzsch-ka!

906
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,740
Screw Kindergarten!

907
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,579
"Kierkegaard?

908
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:07,877
I think it's this way.

909
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:10,079
Screw Nietzsche! Screw Kierkegaard!

910
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,215
And screw... The...

911
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,018
You can't even come up with one more.
That's it, you're done at two.

912
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:21,567
Look, screw all of those dudes.
None of those guys had 533 real kids.

913
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:30,232
Did you bring me here to expose me?

914
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,467
No.

915
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:33,841
I want to keep you all to myself.

916
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:53,456
<i>I know it's coming
I can feel it in my bones</i>

917
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:55,000
All right!

918
00:59:55,492 --> 00:59:59,295
<i>This is information
you already know</i>

919
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:02,731
<i>Even if it's only temporarily</i>

920
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:06,469
<i>Give the illusion tonight
You belong to me</i>

921
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,980
<i>Oh, the things</i>

922
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,908
<i>I will believe</i>

923
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:16,112
<i>Ignore the hundred lovers</i>

924
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:19,385
<i>You got hidden up your sleeve</i>

925
01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:23,027
<i>The words come easily</i>

926
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,854
<i>And they sound so lovely</i>

927
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:26,466
You all right?

928
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:32,161
<i>I guess it's just as
easy if you lie to me</i>

929
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:35,364
- Put these next to the grill, here.
- Next to the grill.

930
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:36,499
Special recipe.

931
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,907
It's a secret family recipe,
but you'll like this.

932
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,376
Wow!

933
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:50,023
Do you see what happens
when the tofu hits the grill?

934
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,014
Nothing.

935
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:55,753
Exactly what happens when
the tofu hits our taste buds.

936
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:02,124
<i>I am alone
I am in love with an idea</i>

937
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:05,794
<i>Sophisticated neurological appeals</i>

938
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:09,498
<i>I want to negotiate
some kind of a deal</i>

939
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:13,202
<i>I want to tear it open
Show you that it's real</i>

940
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:15,971
<i>Oh, the things</i>

941
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:19,278
<i>I will believe</i>

942
01:01:19,543 --> 01:01:22,912
<i>Ignore the hundred lovers</i>

943
01:01:22,913 --> 01:01:26,287
<i>You got hidden up your sleeve</i>

944
01:01:27,584 --> 01:01:29,764
Okay. Get in nice and tight.

945
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:34,960
All right, we got one more.
Get in close.

946
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:36,425
- All right.
- Can I get in?

947
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:37,627
All right.

948
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:42,271
Okay, everybody, just scooch in.
Get as close as you can.

949
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:45,940
Okay, on the left.
Can you move in just a little?

950
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,904
All right. Say, "Cheese."

951
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:50,743
Cheese!

952
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,823
<i>And I'm real, real gone</i>

953
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:10,337
<i>Got me down to the very marrow</i>

954
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:17,278
<i>Don't you know I need your help</i>

955
01:02:19,536 --> 01:02:21,738
<i>You're a friend of mine</i>

956
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:24,783
<i>And I'm real, real gone</i>

957
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,676
Hey. This is Ryan.

958
01:03:00,677 --> 01:03:02,077
- Hey, Ryan.
- What's up, Ryan?

959
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:03,621
- Hey, Ryan.
- Hi.

960
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:30,983
<i>That was the best, right?</i>

961
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,482
I had a great time.

962
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:38,719
So, uh... I guess this is it.

963
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,324
Have a great day.

964
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:52,939
Ryan?

965
01:03:57,067 --> 01:04:00,009
Could I just have a...
Just... Thanks.

966
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:08,119
I...

967
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,554
I just wanted to...
I wanted to tell you...

968
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,593
I'm your father.

969
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:25,534
Okay.

970
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,571
So...

971
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,473
You'll keep seeing more of me.

972
01:04:33,937 --> 01:04:37,050
That was a fun weekend. Okay.

973
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:49,663
You seem way too relaxed.

974
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:52,588
This is a great moment for me.

975
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:54,790
It's a new stage in
our relationship.

976
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:56,095
No.

977
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,802
- No?
- No.

978
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:01,296
It's really important that you
know there is no truth in anything

979
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:04,000
they are going to
say about me. None.

980
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:08,437
You must understand,
they love to humiliate me.

981
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:10,105
They're monsters. Really.

982
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:12,946
- They are monsters.
- Okay.

983
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:19,782
I want to propose a toast to Emma.

984
01:05:19,783 --> 01:05:23,051
Because I think it's important
that you know that this...

985
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:26,388
- Rite of passage.
- Rite of passage.

986
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:28,724
Well, it's not just about
humiliating David.

987
01:05:28,725 --> 01:05:30,426
Although, it is one
of the objectives.

988
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:34,463
And if we have exposed David's
past to the harsh light of day...

989
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:38,066
Well, I think it's important, because you
gotta know what you're getting into.

990
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:39,802
And now that you know all this...

991
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:41,539
I have some more pictures.

992
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,105
Not Sniper.

993
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,406
Sniper?

994
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,518
It was his rock band.
They wore a lot of makeup.

995
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,977
It was the '80s.
Everybody wore makeup.

996
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:51,146
I didn't wear makeup in the '80s.

997
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:54,082
But look,
now that all this is known...

998
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,784
I think it's also very
important for you to know

999
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:59,288
that the Wozniaks have
had some wonderful times

1000
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:02,197
- and some hard times.
- No.

1001
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:04,863
Dad?

1002
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:13,001
When my wife and I were newlyweds,

1003
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:16,513
we always dreamed of having
a honeymoon in Italy.

1004
01:06:16,873 --> 01:06:19,053
But we didn't have much money.

1005
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:21,586
Then we had children.

1006
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:26,158
We told ourselves, someday,
when we're old.

1007
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:28,319
But time passed.

1008
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:30,953
You have to make the
most of the present.

1009
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:32,554
Do you all make the
most of the present?

1010
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:33,655
Yes.

1011
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,563
Yes, Dad. We make the
most of the present.

1012
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:38,026
When my wife fell ill,

1013
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:41,606
David came over one day with
plane tickets to Venice.

1014
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,233
He had seen to everything.

1015
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:47,881
The hotel near Doge's Palace,
the gondolas.

1016
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:52,108
Then later, our three sons
flew over and joined us.

1017
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:57,288
We had a big family dinner
near St. Mark's Square.

1018
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,788
David paid for everything.

1019
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:02,629
David...

1020
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:05,091
He does things like that.

1021
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:08,257
If you are able to live
with his countless faults,

1022
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:11,632
you will also live through
some marvelous times.

1023
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,368
Let us pray.

1024
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,066
- No.
- Come on. Dad, please.

1025
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,769
- Let's drink.
- Yes.

1026
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:28,981
Your father is adorable.

1027
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:30,823
Yeah.

1028
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:35,395
I can't believe you brought
your whole family to Venice.

1029
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:38,323
How did you pay for that?

1030
01:07:38,955 --> 01:07:40,355
I had money.

1031
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:41,790
When you were 20?

1032
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:44,562
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1033
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:48,633
What kind of job did you have that
would pay for a trip to Venice?

1034
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:52,978
It was a manual-labor type job.

1035
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:57,406
That was an awesome meal.

1036
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:01,016
Almost.

1037
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:04,279
All right, let's bring it.
Open the flood gates, here-.

1038
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,583
Have fun. Okay, have a
good day at school, guys.

1039
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:08,750
Have a good time.

1040
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:12,087
It's okay to like recess. How are you?
Look at these angels.

1041
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:15,030
My man, how you feeling?
Have fun, buddy.

1042
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,021
Coffee? Toast? Eggs?

1043
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:36,888
- No.
- How was your weekend?

1044
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,414
- Relaxing.
- Good.

1045
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:40,855
Very relaxed.

1046
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,119
Dinner with the family.

1047
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,226
And I read.

1048
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:46,961
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

1049
01:08:47,023 --> 01:08:49,257
That you lie to your girlfriend,
that's par for the course.

1050
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:51,860
Untruthfulness is the basis of
a good, strong relationship.

1051
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,261
But I'm not your girlfriend, David.

1052
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:55,764
So, before you tell me
that you spent the weekend

1053
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:57,532
with Frodo and Gandalf
and Bilbo Baggins,

1054
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:59,872
why don't you go ahead
and take a look at this?

1055
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:03,505
Well, as you can attest,

1056
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:06,708
the reporter won't be winning any
prizes for his journalistic skills.

1057
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:10,880
But apparently, his story
was picked up by CNN

1058
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:14,757
and Fox, and even the BBC.

1059
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:16,852
Which means, when you
go to bed tonight,

1060
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:20,830
four or five billion people will be
asking, "Who the fuck is Starbuck?"

1061
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:24,059
Now tell me, is this
good news for us?

1062
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,528
Does this augur well for our trial?

1063
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:29,767
Is this the type of situation
over which we can regain control?

1064
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,534
The answer is yes.

1065
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,970
Now, we go on the offensive.

1066
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:37,572
A countersuit. We, too,
are going to sue the clinic.

1067
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:38,774
What for?

1068
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:41,910
Substantial punitive damages.

1069
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:45,247
It's the clinic's duty not to do
anything to jeopardize your anonymity.

1070
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:49,418
By overusing your donations,
they have given rise to a substantial,

1071
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:52,187
well-funded challenge
to your anonymity

1072
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:55,891
which has now generated
extensive media coverage.

1073
01:09:55,892 --> 01:10:00,563
I mean, you should hear the stuff that
people are saying about Starbuck.

1074
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:02,764
What are they saying
about Starbuck?

1075
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:05,434
Terrible things. But it's good.

1076
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:07,436
It's fine,
because our countersuit...

1077
01:10:07,437 --> 01:10:09,480
David, your debt
problems will go away.

1078
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:11,911
We're going after big, big money.

1079
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,113
<i>It is all over Twitter,
it is all over the net.</i>

1080
01:10:18,114 --> 01:10:20,782
<i>No way is this guy coming
out of the closet.</i>

1081
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:21,950
<i>No way!</i>

1082
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,952
<i>At work, every meeting you go into,</i>

1083
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,253
<i>no matter what you say,</i>

1084
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:29,664
<i>everyone will always be thinking,
"Hey, it's</i> El Masturbator."

1085
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:30,859
<i>Five hundred and thirty-three kids!</i>

1086
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:33,836
<i>He's donated 693 times!</i>

1087
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:38,442
<i>Boy, this guy was making money
hand over fist. I can't believe it.</i>

1088
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:42,137
<i>Anyway, listen. He went
by the code name "Starbuck."</i>

1089
01:10:42,138 --> 01:10:43,339
<i>"Starbuck"?</i>

1090
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:46,074
<i>I think "Chock full o'Nuts"
would have been more like it.</i>

1091
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,755
<i>"Chock full o'Nuts"
would have been better.</i>

1092
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,979
You should read some
of these tweets.

1093
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,481
<i>The last kid was an accident.</i>

1094
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:54,816
<i>I guess he was watching
a rerun of Baywatch,</i>

1095
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:56,519
<i>and it just happened.</i>

1096
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:00,865
<i>I had no idea this could
actually be a job.</i>

1097
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:03,534
<i>I mean, I knew it could be a hobby.</i>

1098
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:08,964
What do you think about
all this "Starbuck" business?

1099
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:10,542
Oh, it's horrible.

1100
01:11:11,334 --> 01:11:12,604
What's horrible?

1101
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:16,304
It's horrible. You don't think
it's absolutely horrible?

1102
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:18,173
- I don't know.
- What was he thinking?

1103
01:11:18,174 --> 01:11:22,010
Well, he obviously wasn't thinking
that they would use his sperm so much.

1104
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,112
And he obviously wasn't thinking

1105
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:27,015
that they would choose
his profile so often.

1106
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,350
May I help you?

1107
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:32,154
Yeah, do you have a
stroller for 533 children?

1108
01:11:32,155 --> 01:11:34,856
- No.
- No. No.

1109
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,024
He doesn't.

1110
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:39,194
Because it's not normal
to have 533 children.

1111
01:11:39,195 --> 01:11:40,874
It's not normal.

1112
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:48,837
Viggo, where the
hell are you going?

1113
01:11:48,838 --> 01:11:50,705
- I don't know.
- It goes in the back.

1114
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:52,541
- In the back.
- Okay.

1115
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:54,244
Hey, David.

1116
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,923
Your brothers are in the office.
They want to see you.

1117
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,854
They wanted 100 grand! 100 grand?

1118
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:10,158
I mean, Pop didn't have it.
So they tried to drown him!

1119
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,359
What were you thinking?

1120
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,895
Tell me, David,
what were you thinking?

1121
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:18,169
Get the cash, David.
Get the cash!

1122
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,413
Unbelievable!

1123
01:12:38,221 --> 01:12:40,867
- Dad, listen.
- Go away, David.

1124
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:47,632
Go away.

1125
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:04,455
Let's...

1126
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,721
Let's do the countersuit.

1127
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:13,656
Excellent. Excellent.

1128
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,158
- Come on in.
- All right.

1129
01:13:18,461 --> 01:13:20,428
<i>What would happen if we no longer</i>

1130
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:22,609
<i>respected these types
of agreements?</i>

1131
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:30,516
Nothing less than an
unlimited quantity of chaos.

1132
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:33,778
Custody battles.

1133
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:39,114
Possible intrusions
upon happy families.

1134
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:42,660
And this, on either party's side.

1135
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:48,302
<i>Mothers showing up on
donors' doorsteps.</i>

1136
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:52,999
<i>And donors suddenly
wanting visitation rights,</i>

1137
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:56,798
<i>wanting to partake
in important decisions</i>

1138
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:59,001
<i>about religion, about schooling.</i>

1139
01:14:05,341 --> 01:14:08,488
None of the parties were coerced
into signing this agreement.

1140
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:11,824
And nowhere have I seen
an expiration date.

1141
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,462
What'd you guys think?

1142
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,961
Why don't I understand
when you are talking?

1143
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:26,536
Well, you see...

1144
01:14:27,096 --> 01:14:29,674
This is a complex situation.

1145
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:31,901
I would vote for the other guy.

1146
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:37,472
Well... No. The other guy is wrong.

1147
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:40,745
Grandma's right. I think
you're gonna lose again.

1148
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:43,323
Did she say that?

1149
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:47,716
Okay. Well, all right.
Thanks, kids.

1150
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,590
You can all go to bed.

1151
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,720
Is that going to be
your argument in court?

1152
01:14:51,721 --> 01:14:55,357
That won't work in court.
You can't send the real judge to bed.

1153
01:14:55,358 --> 01:14:58,126
Yes, I can. Daddy can
send anyone to bed.

1154
01:14:58,127 --> 01:15:00,034
And right now,
you're all going to bed.

1155
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:02,000
Now, go.

1156
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:47,575
These are children who are lost.
They are lost in the wilderness.

1157
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:50,578
And they want to know
who their father is.

1158
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:52,554
I mean, is that too much to ask?

1159
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,950
And what would...

1160
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:59,721
What would happen if we no longer
accepted these types of agreements?

1161
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:06,931
Nothing more than an
unlimited quantity of chaos.

1162
01:16:10,633 --> 01:16:11,900
Um...

1163
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:13,307
The mic...

1164
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:15,737
Oh, that's better. Is that okay?

1165
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:18,578
Here we are, outside of
the New York courtroom...

1166
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,191
I feel like this is
an easy case to win.

1167
01:16:26,282 --> 01:16:27,749
<i>What I'm saying is,</i>

1168
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:32,194
<i>which fundamental right should
take more importance here?</i>

1169
01:16:32,455 --> 01:16:34,923
<i>I've been a musician
pretty much my whole life.</i>

1170
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:37,459
And when I write music,
I write it because...

1171
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:40,562
I think, when I say this,
I speak for everyone.

1172
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:41,830
I know, how for me...

1173
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:44,307
I wasn't actually able
to grow up with a dad.

1174
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:48,069
I would like to meet the guy,
the man, who created me.

1175
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:51,172
And there's a lot of transitions
in my life that I've come across.

1176
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:54,676
It's central to who I am.
It's really all I've thought about.

1177
01:16:54,677 --> 01:16:58,950
I just want to feel like
I have a part of myself.

1178
01:16:59,148 --> 01:17:01,783
The last ultrasound that
is on Friday at 2:00,

1179
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:03,657
do you think that you
can make it there?

1180
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:07,522
There is no contract, okay?
They've broken the contract!

1181
01:17:07,523 --> 01:17:08,957
They break with the contract!

1182
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:14,129
The man signed an anonymity
agreement for 693 donations!

1183
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,930
He has a right to punitive damages,

1184
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:18,433
because you should hear what
people are saying about him now.

1185
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:20,034
- You have got to be prepared!
- I am prepared!

1186
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:22,511
Well, then why don't you do it?

1187
01:17:30,513 --> 01:17:32,213
You're my friend, I'm sorry.

1188
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:33,615
- I'm just so pissed off.
- Yeah.

1189
01:17:33,616 --> 01:17:36,050
So we hope that it
has been made clear

1190
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:39,888
that the intentional blocking
of this vital information

1191
01:17:39,889 --> 01:17:44,058
has had, and will continue to have
a negative psychological impact

1192
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:47,763
on each and every single
one of Starbucks children.

1193
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:49,098
In finishing,

1194
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:54,514
while the donor may have bargained
for confidentiality with the clinic,

1195
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:58,406
and the parents may have
accepted that confidentiality

1196
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:02,077
as a condition to receiving
the sperm donation...

1197
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:05,051
The children didn't
agree to anything.

1198
01:18:05,214 --> 01:18:11,057
Yet, they are the ones, they are
the ones most directly affected.

1199
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:14,061
This makes no sense.

1200
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:16,092
Thank you.

1201
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:36,147
These are some great kids.

1202
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:51,428
Without the anonymity clause,

1203
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,805
none of them would be here.

1204
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:58,933
And not to have these
beautiful kids,

1205
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:02,172
that would be a great loss.

1206
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:06,014
We need the anonymity clause.

1207
01:19:21,624 --> 01:19:24,828
The court will now take the
matter under advisement.

1208
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,492
How long could it take?

1209
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:54,622
I don't know, David. I do not know!

1210
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,923
What don't you know?

1211
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:58,693
I know absolutely nothing!
My mother was right.

1212
01:19:58,694 --> 01:20:01,067
I'm useless and I'm
out of my league.

1213
01:20:02,097 --> 01:20:04,368
You should have got
a real lawyer, David.

1214
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,249
All rise!

1215
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,351
You may be seated.

1216
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:28,222
In the adjudicated action,

1217
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:30,725
the parties will receive
a detailed document,

1218
01:20:30,726 --> 01:20:35,432
in which you will read
that Starbuck is entirely,

1219
01:20:35,698 --> 01:20:40,176
and without reservation,
entitled to remain

1220
01:20:40,803 --> 01:20:42,277
anonymous.

1221
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:48,743
He will also be entitled to
$200,000 in punitive damages

1222
01:20:48,744 --> 01:20:51,720
from the Graboski-Levitt Clinic.

1223
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:53,881
You are adjourned.

1224
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:57,051
Starbuck, therefore, will be entitled
to remain completely anonymous.

1225
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:59,987
He also will receive
$200,000 in damages.

1226
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:02,634
Yes! Yes!

1227
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:08,830
Brett, what's your
reaction to the verdict?

1228
01:21:08,831 --> 01:21:11,432
Obviously, I feel great
compassion for the children.

1229
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:13,668
But I am very, very happy.

1230
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:19,207
I am very proud to have vindicated
my client and his rights.

1231
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:24,153
<i>And I want to say thank you to
my own children and to my mother.</i>

1232
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:26,420
<i>Mom, I won.</i>

1233
01:21:26,782 --> 01:21:28,325
<i>I won.</i>

1234
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:33,627
<i>And I just want to say,
David, we did it!</i>

1235
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,556
No!

1236
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:36,891
<i>We did it, David!</i>

1237
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,936
- No.
- Who's David?

1238
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:48,070
<i>He's my lover</i>

1239
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:50,938
<i>who has always been there for me.</i>

1240
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:54,075
<i>And, David, my darling...</i>

1241
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:57,814
<i>I love you, David.
I love you, David.</i>

1242
01:22:01,717 --> 01:22:04,619
Obviously, a very emotional
trial for everyone here.

1243
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:07,027
Did you expect this verdict?

1244
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:09,433
We're disappointed.

1245
01:22:09,892 --> 01:22:13,634
Our case was dismissed, and we've now
exhausted every possible legal recourse.

1246
01:22:14,997 --> 01:22:16,870
But we haven't lost everything.

1247
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:21,302
While we were told today there's no law
requiring Starbuck to identify himself,

1248
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:25,007
there's more to this than
just legal obligation.

1249
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,712
There's us, and there's him.

1250
01:22:28,644 --> 01:22:30,824
And beyond any law,
there are human beings.

1251
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:33,951
So, ultimately, the final
decision is Starbucks.

1252
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:38,130
He's under no legal obligation
to identify himself.

1253
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:40,990
<i>But now that he's seen all of us,</i>

1254
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:44,160
<i>he may well decide to do so.</i>

1255
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,029
<i>That decision is his.</i>

1256
01:22:46,595 --> 01:22:49,997
<i>There has been a lot of unfavorable
comments about Starbuck</i>

1257
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:52,075
<i>in all of this media coverage.</i>

1258
01:22:52,835 --> 01:22:54,869
<i>We would really just
like our father to know</i>

1259
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:57,050
<i>that in our eyes,</i>

1260
01:22:57,172 --> 01:23:00,182
<i>he's not a criminal or a freak.</i>

1261
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:02,413
<i>To us, he's someone</i>

1262
01:23:02,945 --> 01:23:07,218
<i>who gave life and happiness
where it was badly needed.</i>

1263
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:29,680
Congratulations, darling.

1264
01:23:33,976 --> 01:23:35,587
I had it.

1265
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:41,620
I had pitched the perfect game and
I had to screw the whole thing up.

1266
01:23:43,252 --> 01:23:45,864
My mother saw the
whole thing on TV.

1267
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:52,201
Well, she must have been surprised
to find out that you had a male lover.

1268
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:56,405
No. She said she
always suspected it.

1269
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:00,914
She told me we make
a lovely couple.

1270
01:24:03,005 --> 01:24:04,377
And your kids?

1271
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:09,646
- They think it's cool.
- Mmm.

1272
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:16,819
I'm just wondering...

1273
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,722
And really just
theoretically, but...

1274
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:24,959
If I decided to identify myself,

1275
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,231
would I lose all the money
from the countersuit?

1276
01:24:28,864 --> 01:24:30,737
Yeah, I think you would.

1277
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:39,915
Emma always says that, uh...

1278
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,278
That I don't have a life.

1279
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:48,482
So, um, I officially set out

1280
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:53,325
to try and do the right thing.

1281
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,361
It's harder than I thought.

1282
01:25:24,753 --> 01:25:26,125
Pop.

1283
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:29,391
Pop, I'm Starbuck.

1284
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:33,566
You are <i>El Masturbator?</i>

1285
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:36,000
Yeah.

1286
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:48,009
Now, for once in my life, I'd
like to make the right decision.

1287
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:49,510
Once.

1288
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:52,780
For once in my life, I would
like to be a normal person.

1289
01:25:52,781 --> 01:25:55,883
How would a normal person
handle a situation like this?

1290
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:58,690
A normal person would
not be in this situation.

1291
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:03,557
Let's just say that a normal person
had a slight lapse of judgment

1292
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:07,331
and donated sperm 693 times.

1293
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:11,465
What would they do?
What would my brothers do?

1294
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:13,868
Your brothers are not
mentally equipped

1295
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:16,845
to deal with a situation like this.

1296
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:19,740
When you get right down to it,

1297
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:22,743
you're probably one of the
few people on this earth

1298
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:25,618
able to deal with such a situation.

1299
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:28,959
Why not just tell them?

1300
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:32,720
As you know,
I have some money problems.

1301
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:34,798
Yeah, your debts.

1302
01:26:36,091 --> 01:26:40,494
You know I grew up in
terrible, terrible poverty.

1303
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:41,765
Yes, I know, Pop.

1304
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:43,564
I know.

1305
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:48,436
When I left Warsaw to go to the
States, my father gave me $10.

1306
01:26:48,437 --> 01:26:50,617
That was everything he had.

1307
01:26:52,074 --> 01:26:53,774
I couldn't turn down his help,

1308
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:58,981
sol promised him I'd pay him back
1,000 times over, once I got rich.

1309
01:27:01,116 --> 01:27:03,159
My father died

1310
01:27:04,086 --> 01:27:06,994
when your mother and I
still didn't have a cent.

1311
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:09,590
I...

1312
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:12,426
I always wondered what
was harder for him.

1313
01:27:12,427 --> 01:27:14,628
Not being able to give
his children enough,

1314
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:17,833
or not being with them
when they hit hard times.

1315
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:22,645
My great good fortune in life
is to see you boys every day.

1316
01:27:23,305 --> 01:27:26,273
That, for me, is success.

1317
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:28,454
So, like my father,
I want to help you.

1318
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:31,748
Here is $10.

1319
01:27:33,315 --> 01:27:34,823
It brought me good luck.

1320
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:37,523
With $10, I built my empire.

1321
01:27:37,786 --> 01:27:40,193
So, take the $10.

1322
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:43,363
And also take...

1323
01:27:48,497 --> 01:27:50,164
It's your share of the meat store.

1324
01:27:50,165 --> 01:27:54,541
It's your inheritance, in small bills,
to pay off your debts.

1325
01:27:58,673 --> 01:28:00,614
I'm scared I'll disappoint them.

1326
01:28:00,976 --> 01:28:02,883
Why would they be disappointed?

1327
01:28:03,578 --> 01:28:05,621
I'm a meat truck driver.

1328
01:28:06,515 --> 01:28:08,649
I'm an incompetent
meat truck driver.

1329
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:11,296
True, you are incompetent.

1330
01:28:11,987 --> 01:28:16,657
It takes you four times longer to
deliver meat than anyone else.

1331
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:20,361
But wherever you go,
people love you.

1332
01:28:20,362 --> 01:28:22,371
They're going to love you.

1333
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:25,503
Everyone loves you.

1334
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:30,240
Thanks, Pop.

1335
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:35,948
We'll be right with you, sir.

1336
01:29:40,909 --> 01:29:42,144
Emma!

1337
01:29:42,911 --> 01:29:44,146
Emma!

1338
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:58,336
Mr. Wozniak?

1339
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:17,019
You gave us a little scare, there.

1340
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:20,152
Yeah.

1341
01:30:20,649 --> 01:30:22,351
Hi.

1342
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:54,683
Mr. Wozniak?

1343
01:30:57,686 --> 01:30:58,852
Yeah.

1344
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:01,533
Your family is here to see you.

1345
01:31:29,784 --> 01:31:31,190
Is he healthy?

1346
01:31:32,387 --> 01:31:33,725
Yes.

1347
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:37,199
Does that mean he
can work tomorrow?

1348
01:32:22,604 --> 01:32:23,874
This is weird.

1349
01:32:32,614 --> 01:32:34,157
Hey.

1350
01:32:36,017 --> 01:32:37,628
I lied to you.

1351
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:40,296
I am your biological father.

1352
01:32:47,295 --> 01:32:49,668
And you have a little brother.

1353
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:54,407
He was in a bit of a hurry. But...

1354
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:59,776
He's doing very, very, very well.

1355
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:01,178
Can we see him?

1356
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,284
I'll find out.

1357
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:26,269
Hey.

1358
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:32,049
He's so small.

1359
01:33:32,674 --> 01:33:34,012
Emma.

1360
01:33:40,682 --> 01:33:42,122
Will you marry me?

1361
01:33:44,686 --> 01:33:47,560
Wouldn't you want to wait and
see if I get my figure back?

1362
01:33:49,257 --> 01:33:53,564
If you stay flabby, I promise
I'll get flabby as well.

1363
01:33:54,362 --> 01:33:56,463
I wonder if that's the first
time the word "flabby"

1364
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:58,735
has been used in a
marriage proposal.

1365
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:14,087
Emma...

1366
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:18,423
I'm Starbuck.

1367
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,842
Why are you always scamming?

1368
01:34:34,402 --> 01:34:37,971
God, how could you think
that a marriage proposal

1369
01:34:37,972 --> 01:34:43,410
would excuse the fact that you're
the father of 533 children?

1370
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:45,921
David! God!

1371
01:34:47,882 --> 01:34:49,288
How...

1372
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:52,891
This is no longer your child.

1373
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:57,090
I want to be very
clear on two points.

1374
01:34:57,091 --> 01:34:58,692
The first point.

1375
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:00,861
I said I was gonna change
as quickly as possible,

1376
01:35:00,862 --> 01:35:02,132
and I am doing that.

1377
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:05,199
I've had a chance to do a
lot of thinking. A lot!

1378
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:08,535
And I've come to the conclusion
that it's not anyone but me

1379
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:11,171
who can decide if I
am the father or not.

1380
01:35:11,172 --> 01:35:14,575
Not a judge, not my
family, not Dr. Phil,

1381
01:35:14,576 --> 01:35:16,710
and in the end, not you.

1382
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:21,848
In other words, nobody but the father
can decide if he is the father or not.

1383
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:25,929
And I, David Wozniak,
am the father of this child.

1384
01:35:26,588 --> 01:35:31,525
The other reality that can't be changed
is the fact that I am Starbuck.

1385
01:35:31,526 --> 01:35:33,927
Now, this, obviously,
can be somewhat frightening

1386
01:35:33,928 --> 01:35:38,131
since it's something totally new,
and no one on this planet

1387
01:35:38,132 --> 01:35:41,006
has ever experienced
it before. It's...

1388
01:35:41,769 --> 01:35:45,178
It is like the first
steps on the moon.

1389
01:35:46,708 --> 01:35:49,076
But despite a few drawbacks,

1390
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:51,478
I think that we can actually
take away from this

1391
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:54,353
a tremendous amount of joy.

1392
01:35:54,782 --> 01:35:59,488
Not to mention, vast amounts
of free babysitting.

1393
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:02,692
I don't know how this
is gonna work out.

1394
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:05,158
Right now, me coming out
and revealing who I am,

1395
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:06,927
I'm risking everything.

1396
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:12,669
I'm risking all for the
well-being of my 533 kids.

1397
01:36:12,834 --> 01:36:15,435
And I would think that
you seeing me risk all

1398
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,809
should convince you
that whatever happens,

1399
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:23,218
that no matter what turmoil this kid
right here gets into, I will be there.

1400
01:36:23,845 --> 01:36:26,980
Now, you asked me to have a life.

1401
01:36:26,981 --> 01:36:30,719
Well, here it is. This is my life.

1402
01:36:32,353 --> 01:36:36,160
It may be a bit strange.

1403
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,493
And a bit oversized.

1404
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:42,808
But it's my life.

1405
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:46,500
The second point.

1406
01:36:46,501 --> 01:36:48,168
That was a very long first point.

1407
01:36:48,169 --> 01:36:52,506
The first point was long.
The second point...

1408
01:36:52,507 --> 01:36:57,087
The marriage proposal
was not a scam.

1409
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:01,986
The second point was much shorter.

1410
01:37:02,617 --> 01:37:05,093
I need you in my life.

1411
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:28,046
Promise me, one day
you'll take me to Venice.

1412
01:37:41,723 --> 01:37:43,256
Okay.

1413
01:37:43,257 --> 01:37:45,733
<i>The world is yours</i>

1414
01:37:48,396 --> 01:37:50,831
<i>Hold it close</i>

1415
01:37:50,832 --> 01:37:54,070
<i>With open arms</i>

1416
01:37:54,502 --> 01:37:56,204
<i>Little feet</i>

1417
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:01,552
<i>We've miles ahead</i>

1418
01:38:04,579 --> 01:38:06,918
<i>Take it slow</i>

1419
01:38:06,948 --> 01:38:08,081
<i>See it all</i>

1420
01:38:08,082 --> 01:38:09,317
Wow.

1421
01:38:10,051 --> 01:38:12,288
<i>Take it in</i>

1422
01:38:15,423 --> 01:38:19,230
<i>I see me in you</i>

1423
01:38:20,762 --> 01:38:23,169
<i>You in me</i>

1424
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:29,506
<i>I see me in you</i>

1425
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:34,017
<i>You in me</i>

1426
01:38:36,477 --> 01:38:39,749
<i>I see it in your eyes</i>

1427
01:38:41,816 --> 01:38:45,327
<i>I see it in your eyes</i>

1428
01:38:48,156 --> 01:38:50,632
<i>Little heart</i>

1429
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:55,705
<i>Dance it out</i>

1430
01:38:57,999 --> 01:39:00,333
<i>The ins and outs
won't bring you down</i>

1431
01:39:00,334 --> 01:39:01,638
Okay. Have fun.

1432
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:06,480
<i>Little dream</i>

1433
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:11,682
<i>Grow up tall</i>

1434
01:39:14,482 --> 01:39:19,722
<i>With a little rain, a little sun</i>

1435
01:39:20,021 --> 01:39:22,997
<i>You'll feel loved</i>

1436
01:39:25,526 --> 01:39:29,367
Many thanks, from your
entire real family.

1437
01:39:33,034 --> 01:39:36,374
<i>I see it in your eyes</i>

1438
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:42,186
<i>Little hands</i>

1439
01:39:44,212 --> 01:39:49,657
<i>Hold it close with open arms</i>

1440
01:39:50,318 --> 01:39:52,429
<i>Little hands</i>

1441
01:40:01,629 --> 01:40:04,698
<i>The light of love</i>

1442
01:40:04,699 --> 01:40:07,743
<i>Oh, light of love</i>

1443
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:11,441
<i>Won't you shine on me</i>

1444

<i>Won't you shine on me</i>
