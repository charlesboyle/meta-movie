1
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,040
We have a midcourse deviation.

2
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,300
Target heading 036, 126 miles.

3
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,300
Bearing 062, Havana, VOR.

4
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,060
He's landing at Cray Cay.

5
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,770
Advise Key West Drug Enforcement.

6
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,440
Roger, sir. AWACS to Key West.

7
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Key West Drug Enforcement, please come in.

8
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,820
If they hurry, they just might
be able to grab the bastard.

9
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,990
Now, you're sure you've got the ring?

10
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,500
Relax, Felix.

11
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,090
Friends of yours?

12
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,840
My partners at the DEA.

13
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,270
What the hell is going on?

14
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,190
Sanchez is in the Bahamas.

15
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,570
Have you cleared it with Nassau?

16
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,740
We've got the green light.

17
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,900
Let's go! Hey, Felix, Felix!

18
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,450
Haven't you forgotten something?

19
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,450
Oh, James, explain to Della, will you?

20
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,490
No way. I'm coming with you.

21
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,460
Okay, but strictly as an observer.

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,330
- Sorry, Sharkey.
- Hey, why me?

23
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,790
Hey, you guys, you can't do this to me!

24
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,050
What will I tell Della?

25
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,280
What did he promise you? His heart?

26
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,620
Give her his heart.

27
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,490
No.

28
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,250
No, Franz. I didn't mean any harm.

29
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,580
It's all right, baby.

30
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,760
We all make mistakes.

31
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,930
Your escapades are getting more creative.

32
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,560
Not a word.

33
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,580
He's still not here.

34
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,370
Can you go around the block again?

35
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,450
What about the guests?

36
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,870
I told you this was a mistake!

37
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,050
James, just in case.

38
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,280
Okay.

39
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,630
I want Sanchez alive! Stay here, James.

40
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,730
- No Sanchez.
- Damn.

41
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,190
Watch out!

42
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,570
Hey, observer!

43
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,950
You're trying to get yourself killed?

44
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,240
If I don't get you back for the
wedding, I'm a dead man for sure!

45
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,670
- You need help?
- No. Take your hands off me.

46
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,420
Just go away.

47
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,180
Sanchez!

48
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,300
Let's go!

49
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,620
Come on! Come on!

50
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,090
He'll be in Cuban airspace in 20 minutes.

51
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,920
He hasn't got away yet.

52
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,930
What the hell are you doing?

53
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,800
Let's go fishing!

54
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,670
Forward. Forward.

55
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,470
Easy. Hold it.

56
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,600
Back up. Back up.

57
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,560
Forward now.

58
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,400
Hold it!

59
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,870
Bring him in. Take the load.

60
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,090
No, please go home. I'm very...

61
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,500
There he is!

62
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,180
Let's go, James!

63
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,670
We made it!

64
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,260
Come along. James!

65
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,300
- Your hat.
- Thank you.

66
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,370
I need, I need, I've got
to hold on to your love.

67
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,090
Ooooh.

68
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:20,220
Hey, baby, think you need a friend
to stand here by your side?

69
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,760
Yes, you do.

70
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,270
Your side.

71
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,440
Oh, baby, now you can depend on me.

72
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,020
To do things right.

73
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,990
Things right.

74
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:41,160
Please don't bet that
you'll ever escape me.

75
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,370
Once I get my sights on you.

76
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,750
Got a license to kill.

77
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:54,840
And you know I'm going
straight for your heart.

78
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:00,470
Got a license to kill.

79
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:07,180
Anyone who tries to tear us apart.

80
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,270
Honey.

81
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,060
License to kill.

82
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,280
Say that somebody tries
to make a move on you.

83
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,700
In the blink of an eye,
I will be there too.

84
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,870
And they'd better know why
I'm gonna make them pay.

85
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:35,380
Till their dying day Till their dying day.

86
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,800
Till their dying day.

87
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,560
Got a license to kill.

88
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,810
And you know I'm going
straight for your heart, baby.

89
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,940
Got a license to kill.

90
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:05,700
Anyone who tries to tear us apart.

91
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,340
License to kill.

92
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,180
Gotta hold onto your loving.

93
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,430
License to kill.

94
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,610
Kill.

95
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,610
On the double!

96
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,990
Get away from the door!

97
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,280
You're facing 139 felony counts, Sanchez.

98
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,620
Why, that's 936 years.

99
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,790
Even one of your famous million-dollar
bribes can't get you out of this one.

100
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,090
Two.

101
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,300
What?

102
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,840
$2 million, U.S.

103
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,300
A standing offer for anyone who springs me.

104
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,680
God damn it!

105
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,390
You think you're in some banana republic?

106
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,480
All that scumbag money won't
do you a bit of good here.

107
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,850
Very good.

108
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,480
But I think I'm gonna be home soon, huh?

109
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,070
Why you...

110
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,190
Get a hold of yourself!

111
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,910
We got a nice private cell waiting
for your ass at Quantico,

112
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,530
and I'm going to personally
see you get there.

113
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,500
I'm terribly sorry!

114
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,960
That's a custom. You see, the bride
always gets to kiss her best man.

115
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,590
I thought it was the other way around.

116
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,300
Oh, James, would you mind?

117
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,760
Felix is still in the study, and
we've got to cut this cake.

118
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,930
I'll do anything for a woman with a knife.

119
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,440
Thank you. Yes, could you help me here?

120
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,780
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. Come in. We're finished.

121
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,030
Pam, meet James.

122
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,450
Goodbye, Felix.

123
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,250
Strictly business, my friend.

124
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,750
Switch that thing off, Felix.

125
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,670
You know you have a house
full of guests waiting.

126
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,960
Just let me save this. Take a seat.

127
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,550
The department wants a
full report, yesterday.

128
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,380
We really hit it lucky today.

129
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,970
Sanchez hasn't been out of
his home base for years.

130
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,050
Well, couldn't you extradite him?

131
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,140
Not a chance.

132
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,810
He's killed, intimidated or bribed

133
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,390
half the government officials
from here to Chile.

134
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,600
There's only one law down
there, Sanchez's law.

135
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,110
Lead or silver.

136
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,570
Ed.

137
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,610
Double congratulations, old buddy.

138
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,780
You take your time on the honeymoon.
Everything's okay.

139
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,450
You must be Bond, the guy who
came along for the ride.

140
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,960
Ed Killifer.

141
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,750
We're taking Sanchez to
Quantico this afternoon.

142
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,500
Hey, stay and have a drink with us.

143
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,630
Can't. Got to get back.

144
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,090
I just came by to kiss the bride.

145
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,680
Felix, it's time to cut the cake.

146
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,890
Hand me the picture of Della. Quick.

147
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,100
She must be ready to kill me.

148
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,650
I tied them myself.

149
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,530
- What are these?
- Lures!

150
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,530
These'll keep you busy
for the next few days.

151
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,620
I'm not going fishing on my honeymoon!

152
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,910
How many others are being held in there?

153
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,540
Where are you taking him, Mr. Killifer?

154
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,170
Now, why did you go to the Bahamas?

155
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,170
Mr. Sanchez, will you look this
way for a picture, please?

156
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,670
Come on, get him inside!

157
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,840
Are you really a Colombian?

158
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,390
Have you been fairly treated?

159
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,050
One more picture, please!

160
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,390
Are you connected with any
laboratories in South America?

161
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,640
Why did you go to the Bahamas?

162
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,980
No more questions.

163
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,390
Do you expect to be
vindicated, Mr. Sanchez?

164
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,980
Wait a minute!

165
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,070
Okay, let's go.

166
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,480
Yeah, we're moving out.

167
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,590
Will you excuse me, Liala? Just a minute.

168
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,220
- I have a surprise for you.
- Oh, really.

169
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,010
Yes, I do. It's right over here.

170
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,100
What's that?

171
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,230
James. Love always, Della and Felix.

172
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,730
We love you.

173
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,990
Thanks.

174
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,820
Come on!

175
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,720
Did you get him?

176
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,850
Hang on.

177
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,010
I can't see him.

178
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,260
How deep is it there?

179
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,060
How many were inside?

180
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,640
Oh, James!

181
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,060
I wanted you to have something.

182
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,930
You know the tradition?

183
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,440
The next one who catches
this is the next one who...

184
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,940
No.

185
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,690
No. Thanks, Della.

186
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,490
It's time I left.

187
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,400
Oh, James.

188
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,370
Did I say something wrong?

189
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,830
He was married once, but
it was a long time ago.

190
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,220
Felix, you're no good to
me with a wrecked back.

191
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,730
Let her go. I'm the one you want.

192
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,910
Hey! Ready to go?

193
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,960
We got the batteries recharged on the sub.

194
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,290
It'll take you to the 12-mile limit.

195
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,340
Fast boat to Cuba, you'll
be there for breakfast.

196
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,090
Relax. We'll wait for Dario.

197
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,920
Look, are you crazy?

198
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,180
You got everybody looking for you.

199
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,720
What about Killifer?

200
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,930
Having a cop here is nuts!

201
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,930
I want to deep-six him.

202
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,310
I made a deal with this guy,
and I'm going to keep my word.

203
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,270
I don't like it. He can finger me.

204
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,900
I spent a fortune on this cover.

205
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,660
Something you'd better understand, amigo,

206
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,990
loyalty is more important to me than money.

207
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,790
Now, get the cop.

208
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,750
Killifer.

209
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,630
There's $2 million, all in twenties.

210
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,010
It's very heavy, but difficult to trace.

211
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,140
Smart.

212
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,550
Be ready for tomorrow.

213
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,100
I have someone to pick you up.

214
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,640
- Where's Lupe?
- On the boat.

215
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,350
Keep her there until I send for her.

216
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,860
Hey, no fooling around with my girl.

217
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,570
You kidding?

218
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,780
After what you did to
that guy on the islands?

219
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,030
You liked my little valentine, huh?

220
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,350
Where's my wife?

221
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,940
Don't worry. We gave her a nice honeymoon.

222
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,660
I want you to know this
is nothing personal.

223
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,330
It's purely

224
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,210
business.

225
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,940
Killifer!

226
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,900
Sorry, old buddy, but two mil
is a hell of a chunk of dough.

227
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,750
Killing me won't stop anything, Sanchez!

228
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,790
There are worse things than dying, hombre.

229
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,010
See you in hell!

230
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,140
No.

231
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,350
Today's the first day of
the rest of your life.

232
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,980
No!

233
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,840
Thank you.

234
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,720
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

235
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,890
Thank you.

236
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,850
Your passport, please?

237
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,150
What's going on?

238
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,860
Some big drug dealer just escaped.

239
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,200
Now, will that be smoking
or non-smoking, Mr...

240
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,320
Your ticket!

241
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,480
Felix?

242
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,990
Della!

243
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,810
Della?

244
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,060
Felix.

245
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,140
You'll be all right. Hang on.

246
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,480
Hey, Leiter. Where you been?

247
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,530
It's Bond. Get an ambulance here, quick!

248
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,290
Hi, Sharkey.

249
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,000
You stick around.

250
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,790
I might have some more
questions for you, okay?

251
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,290
How is he?

252
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,340
His left leg's gone below the knee.

253
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,340
They might be able to save his arm.

254
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,220
You can bet it was a chain saw.

255
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,680
Colombians love to use them on informers.

256
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,180
Hell, they sell more here
than in the state of Oregon.

257
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,770
I wish I could be more hopeful,

258
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,810
but we'll have to wait and see.

259
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,650
Chain saw, my ass!

260
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,940
I know a shark bite when I see one.

261
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,240
Sanchez has vanished.

262
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,870
He's got all of Leiter's files.

263
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,370
God only knows what's in them.

264
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,830
Well, find him.

265
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,500
He's out of our jurisdiction.

266
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,170
I mean, there's plenty of
countries that will protect him.

267
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,800
We can't even get an extradition.

268
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,880
There are other ways.

269
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,880
Let it go, Commander.

270
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,010
You're going to do nothing?

271
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,180
You're just going to forget all about it?

272
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,390
No, I'm not gonna forget about it!

273
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:06,140
Looks like Sanchez's law operates
north of the border, too.

274
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,640
Let's go shark hunting.

275
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,740
This is the last place in the Keys.

276
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,110
We'll have to try Miami next.

277
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,660
Stay here.

278
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,340
You stay out of sight. I'll handle this.

279
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,140
We're closed. Ain't nobody here.

280
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,390
Look, I've come all the way
from London to see you.

281
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,600
Universal Exports.

282
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,360
We've been retained by
the Regent's Park Zoo

283
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,320
to arrange shipment of a
Carcharodon carcharias.

284
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,440
A what?

285
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,490
Great white shark.

286
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,450
It's all right, Bill. Let him in.

287
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,950
Unfortunately, we sold all
our sharks years ago.

288
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,620
As you can see, we do purely research now.

289
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,660
It's a project to feed the third world.

290
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,500
We feed maggots to our special breed

291
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,710
of genetically engineered fish,

292
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:18,420
use hormones to make them all
male, gain weight faster.

293
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,930
From your shark-hunting days?

294
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,350
Yeah. Actually, it's for sale.

295
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,650
Look, I'm kind of busy.
Maybe some other time.

296
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,110
Thank you. I look forward
to seeing you again.

297
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,070
Goodbye, Mr...

298
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,410
Goodbye.

299
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,190
Mr. Krest said to be ready.

300
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,730
He'll send the sub back in
three hours to pick you up.

301
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,360
Can't wait.

302
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,700
This dump gives me the creeps.

303
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,750
James.

304
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,920
Hold it, right there.

305
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,310
Do you mind if I get my hands out of here?

306
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,270
Yeah. Do it slowly.

307
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,970
Freeze!

308
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,310
Over by the trapdoor, old buddy.

309
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,740
Is this where you put your old buddy Felix?

310
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,160
Not me.

311
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,370
Chalk that one up to Sanchez and Krest.

312
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,980
There's $2 million in that suitcase.

313
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,190
I'll split it with you.

314
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,240
You earned it.

315
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,370
You keep it, old buddy.

316
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,340
God, what a terrible waste.

317
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,220
Of money.

318
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,230
Hey, Sharkey!

319
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,480
Any news on the Wavekrest?

320
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,570
Yeah. She's a big marine research
vessel owned by a Milton Krest.

321
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,870
They're collecting specimens
off the Cay Sal Bank.

322
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,990
How long will it take us to get there?

323
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,080
Maybe about six hours.

324
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,960
I have a few things to pick up.
Be ready in an hour.

325
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,500
Yeah, okay.

326
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,760
Hey, Commander, you got a minute?

327
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,840
Local cops got a tip about
a warehouse last night.

328
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,970
Turned up 500 keys of Colombian
pure, a couple of stiffs,

329
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,230
and a little bitty piece of
what used to be Killifer.

330
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,190
Good. At least someone's on the case.

331
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,900
You may be a pal of Leiter's, but
I can only cover up so much.

332
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,400
The D.A. Is screaming
to know what happened.

333
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,410
You know, we got laws in this country, too.

334
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:02,830
Do you have a law against
what they did to Leiter?

335
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,330
Look, you're in over your head.

336
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,460
This is where it ends, Commander.

337
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,250
You were supposed to be
in Istanbul last night.

338
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:54,250
I'm afraid this unfortunate Leiter business

339
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,710
has clouded your judgment.

340
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,050
You have a job to do.

341
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,470
I expect you on a plane this afternoon.

342
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,880
I haven't finished here, sir.

343
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,640
Leave it to the Americans.

344
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,470
It's their mess. Let them clear it up.

345
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,930
Sir, they're not going to do anything.

346
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,520
Look, I owe it to Leiter.

347
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,020
He's put his life on the
line for me many times.

348
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,610
Spare me this sentimental rubbish.

349
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,690
He knew the risks.

350
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,990
And his wife?

351
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:22,280
This private vendetta of yours
could easily compromise.

352
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,200
Her Majesty's government.

353
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,580
You have an assignment, and I
expect you to carry it out

354
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,040
objectively and professionally.

355
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,250
Then you have my resignation, sir.

356
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,000
We're not a country club, 007.

357
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,760
Effective immediately,

358
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,180
your license to kill is revoked,

359
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,310
and I require you to hand over your weapon.

360
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,640
Now.

361
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,650
I need hardly remind you that you're
still bound by the Official Secrets Act.

362
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,900
Well, then I guess it's

363
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,910
a farewell to arms.

364
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,790
Don't! Too many people.

365
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,930
God help you, Commander.

366
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,030
Something in sector C.

367
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,420
You caused us all a lot
of trouble, young lady.

368
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,840
You're borracho. Go to bed.

369
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,340
When Sanchez heard you ran away,

370
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,760
he went nuts.

371
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,060
It's none of your business.

372
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,350
It's my business when
your stupid little tricks

373
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,480
get Sanchez arrested,

374
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,070
and I gotta put my organization
at risk to get him out.

375
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,730
The DEA just raided Key West.

376
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,900
You cost me a lot of dough.

377
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,530
He'll give you the money.

378
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,740
He doesn't work that way.

379
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,000
You better watch yourself, girlie.

380
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,080
I've known him a long time.

381
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,630
I've seen a lot of girls
like you come and go.

382
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,800
You're drunk. Get out.

383
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,470
And stop peeking through my windows.

384
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,890
Hey, come on, come on, what
are you so stuck-up for?

385
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:52,140
He fixed that phony beauty contest you won.

386
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,020
Hey. Mr. Krest?

387
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,140
Yeah, what?

388
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,850
The Sentinel's picking up something
large on the monitor, sir.

389
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,360
I think you'd better take a look.

390
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,400
I don't believe this.

391
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,700
What the hell is it now?

392
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,420
It's just a manta ray.
Get the probe back in.

393
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,300
We'll start loading now.

394
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,380
Yes, sir.

395
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,990
He said you're okay.

396
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,610
Take care of him.

397
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,840
Make a sound and you're dead.

398
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,640
You.

399
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,640
What are you doing in here?

400
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,520
Krest gave me his cabin.

401
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,310
He's next door. Where's Sanchez?

402
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,980
He's not onboard.

403
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,650
I don't know where he is.

404
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,150
You're his girlfriend.

405
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,820
He doesn't tell me anything.

406
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,330
Open it. I need to talk to you.

407
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,240
Answer it.

408
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,710
Just a moment.

409
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,750
- What do you want?
- Somebody slipped aboard.

410
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,380
Did you see anybody?

411
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,420
No, I was sleeping. Go away.

412
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,510
Mr. Krest. They're back.

413
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,010
Bolt your door.

414
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,850
Who whipped you? Sanchez?

415
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,150
It was my fault.

416
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,530
I did something wrong, made him angry.

417
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,200
Nice work, Clive.

418
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:29,370
Thanks, Mr. Krest. Guess what?
His name was Sharkey.

419
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:34,170
Get rid of the boat. We've got work to do.

420
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,510
You'd better find yourself a new lover.

421
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,800
Don't you men know any other way?

422
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:43,850
It's Sanchez's way. You seem to like it.

423
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,810
You know nothing.

424
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,930
Please go.

425
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,100
If they find you here,
we'll both be killed.

426
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,770
Stay here.

427
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,650
We got everything useful out of her.

428
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,780
That's it. Take her out and sink her.

429
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,950
Okay, Clive. Cast off!

430
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,330
Compliments of Sharkey.

431
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,090
Man overboard!

432
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,850
Get him! Don't let him get away!

433
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,520
What's wrong?

434
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,390
Get back in your cabin and stay there.

435
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,440
The guy must have drowned, Mr. Krest.

436
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,150
Don't be so sure. Find him!

437
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,200
Come on!

438
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,120
Launch Sentinel!

439
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,370
Yes, sir!

440
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,680
Stand by to dive when I tell you.

441
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,360
Numbers one and two, dive!

442
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,340
I can see something reflecting over there!

443
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,470
There's too much turbulence to be sure.

444
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,360
Wavekrest! Wavekrest!

445
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,490
Loading completed, Mr. Krest.

446
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,780
Bring Sentinel back in.

447
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,120
Yes, sir.

448
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,290
Mr. Krest!

449
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,550
Bring Sentinel up!

450
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,220
There he is! There! Right there! Get him!

451
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,510
There!

452
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,270
Dive, damn it! Dive!

453
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:18,770
Right there!

454
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,700
There! Pick him up!

455
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,500
All boats return to Wavekrest!

456
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,210
Aye, aye, sir.

457
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,390
Here. Put her stern-in.

458
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,030
Hey, do you know someone called Bouvier?

459
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,120
Over there.

460
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,460
Well, this is an unexpected pleasure.

461
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,790
Where's Leiter?

462
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,460
Hospital, intensive care.

463
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,380
Where you'll be if you don't
get out of here fast.

464
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,250
Sanchez has Leiter's files.

465
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,050
Your name's all over them.

466
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:42,890
Hell, I knew something was wrong.

467
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,100
Those two have been at the bar for hours.

468
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,390
Probably waiting to see
who showed up to meet me.

469
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,060
Would you like anything to drink?

470
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,850
Bud with a lime. Yeah, same.

471
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,650
Sure thing, hon.

472
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,070
Shit! It's Dario. He's bad news.

473
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,660
He used to be with the Contras
before they kicked him out.

474
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,530
Just the kind of guy Sanchez would send.

475
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,490
You carrying?

476
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:16,210
If they start shooting, you just
hit the deck and stay there.

477
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:33,270
La senorita Bouvier.Don't I
know you from somewhere?

478
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:36,360
- No.
- Oh, yes, I do.

479
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,030
You used to fly charter planes
for some friends of mine.

480
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,900
I got a job for you.

481
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:44,660
Why don't we go outside,
and we talk in private.

482
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:47,450
Take your hands off her. She's with me.

483
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:49,370
Nobody's asking you, gringo.

484
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,410
He's with me. Keep your hands on the table.

485
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,170
Here we go.

486
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,920
Two beers. That'll be $3.50.

487
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,340
Do your friends want something?

488
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,090
Let me get it!

489
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,520
He's had enough. Run a tab.

490
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,020
Okay.

491
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,480
- How did you get here?
- By boat.

492
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,190
- Where is it?
- Back behind this wall.

493
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,950
Thanks.

494
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:10,660
Touche.

495
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:27,800
Get it started.

496
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,280
Come on!

497
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,640
Don't move.

498
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,850
Relax. It's a bulletproof vest.

499
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,310
This Kevlar's great.

500
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,730
You're bloody lucky to be alive!

501
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:26,030
It's not luck. It's experience.

502
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:28,320
A few inches higher, it'd
have been your head.

503
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,320
Look, I just saved your life back there.

504
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,570
If it wasn't for me,

505
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,370
your ass would've been nailed to the wall.

506
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,660
You saved my life?

507
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,200
Yes.

508
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:38,660
It's a tough business you've
picked, Miss Bouvier.

509
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,080
Leave it to the professionals.

510
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,500
Look, pal, I was an army pilot.

511
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:45,340
I have flown to the toughest
hellholes in South America,

512
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:49,090
and I will not have you lecture
me about professionalism.

513
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,520
Out of gas.

514
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,390
I haven't heard that one in a long time.

515
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:05,810
Well, they must have hit the fuel line.

516
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,320
Look, I'm gonna need your help.

517
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,610
I want a complete rundown
on Sanchez's operation,

518
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:15,200
and I'll need a flight to
Isthmus City, private.

519
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,950
No one must know I've left.

520
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,580
What do you want to go there for?

521
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,540
I'll pay you very well.

522
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:24,380
You're going after Sanchez, aren't you?

523
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,130
Will you help me?

524
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,750
How many men have you got?

525
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,130
Just you and me.

526
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:36,930
Are you crazy?

527
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:39,140
Sanchez has an entire army
protecting him down there.

528
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,850
Just fly me in and leave. $50,000.

529
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,350
It's not that easy.

530
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,480
False flight plans, payoffs
at Isthmus City Airport.

531
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,400
I can't do a job like
that for less than 100.

532
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,730
Sixty.

533
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,900
- Ninety.
- Seventy.

534
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,990
- Eighty.
- Seventy-five.

535
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,200
You pay the fuel?

536
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,830
You get the plane.

537
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:05,790
Deal.

538
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:18,930
Now, why don't you wait until you're asked?

539
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,220
Well, why don't you ask me?

540
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,800
There are five typing errors
on the first page alone.

541
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:59,140
What's got into you?

542
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,470
Sorry, sir.

543
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,440
"U.S. Immigration has no reports of 007"

544
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:10,360
"leaving the United States
as of 1500 hours today."

545
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,440
Who authorized this?

546
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:14,740
I did, sir.

547
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,530
I thought you'd be worried about James.
He's gone missing.

548
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:21,160
You know him better than that.
He'll go after Sanchez.

549
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,830
He's got to be stopped.

550
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:26,710
I've already alerted our man in Isthmus.

551
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,330
I want that out by this afternoon.

552
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,170
Yes, sir.

553
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,960
Q Branch, please.

554
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,400
This is the master bedroom.

555
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:01,320
I hope everything is satisfactory, senor.

556
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,030
It's adequate.

557
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,990
I'd like a case of
champagne, Bollinger R. D.

558
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,330
Certainly, senor.

559
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,370
If I could ask you to sign
the registration cards?

560
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,540
No. My executive secretary, Miss
Kennedy, will take care of that.

561
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:15,210
Miss Kennedy...

562
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,090
Right here, please.

563
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,940
Fresh flowers every day.

564
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,730
Thank you very much.

565
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,320
Your key. Enjoy your stay.

566
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,570
It's Ms. Kennedy,

567
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:45,160
and why can't you be my
executive secretary?

568
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,040
We're south of the border.
It's a man's world.

569
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,460
Thanks for everything. Your job's finished.

570
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,050
- I want to stay.
- Too dangerous.

571
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,420
Enough people have been killed already.

572
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:00,380
Don't talk to me about danger.

573
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:02,880
I won't be safe until Sanchez is dead.

574
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:05,350
Besides, you could use my help.

575
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:10,770
Well, if you're going to stay
and be my executive secretary,

576
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:12,890
you'd better look the part.

577
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,770
Here. Buy yourself some decent clothes.

578
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,450
What bank does Sanchez use?
I need to make a deposit.

579
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:24,320
The biggest one in town, Banco de Isthmus.

580
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:25,870
He owns it.

581
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:43,680
Senor Bond.

582
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,850
I've come to make a small deposit.

583
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:52,680
Well, I'm sure my people
downstairs are quite capable of...

584
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,560
Please sit down.

585
01:00:56,230 --> 01:01:00,440
We operate the world's largest
private investment fund.

586
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:03,990
Our biggest problem is what
to do with all the money.

587
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:08,450
We have a cash surplus
of $10 million a day,

588
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,410
which we ship, through our bank,

589
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,910
to the U.S. Federal Reserve,

590
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,870
thus establishing credits

591
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,790
which can be used for any
legitimate investment.

592
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,510
See, someone has to help the
gringos with their trade deficit.

593
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:27,550
Make out a deposit receipt for
$4,900,000 for senor Bond.

594
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,430
And of course there will be additional
monthly deposits in the same amount.

595
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,640
Of course. Be assured,
we at Banco de Isthmus

596
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:35,690
are experienced in handling
accounts of this nature.

597
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:37,310
Let me pass, please.

598
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,190
- Senor Montelongo.
- Yes?

599
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,650
I'm Ms. Kennedy,

600
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,160
Mr. Bond's executive secretary.

601
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,570
I'd also appreciate it
if you could establish

602
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,830
a line of credit for me at the casino.

603
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:53,410
Shall we say $2 million?

604
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,540
No problem.

605
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:56,040
You have excellent collateral,

606
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,460
and our chairman also owns the casino.

607
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,380
Oh, a very convenient arrangement.

608
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:03,210
We have always thought so, senorita.

609
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,720
Thank you. Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen, and welcome.

610
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,760
This is a very special night for us.

611
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:15,100
We want you to know that only through
your very generous donations

612
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:18,440
can the work here at the
OMI continue to progress.

613
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:22,650
We've learned so much, but we've
only just scratched the surface.

614
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:23,730
We need your help.

615
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:27,360
We need you to go to your phones
right now and make a pledge.

616
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:29,160
This is not for me.

617
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,950
This is not for them. It's for all of us.

618
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,410
You okay, reinita?

619
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:33,870
I'm fine.

620
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:35,950
Krest called me from the boat

621
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,040
with a story about
somebody ripping him off.

622
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,420
Did you see anything happen
when you were there?

623
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,880
No, Franz. I stayed in my
cabin most of the time.

624
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,550
We need your help.

625
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,470
What's the matter, baby, huh?

626
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:51,140
You know I can't stand that thing.

627
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,940
I'd like a private table. Blacklack.

628
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,690
Certainly, senor Bond.

629
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:05,030
Would you come this way, please?

630
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:14,700
Quarter of a million dollars,

631
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:18,040
and I'd like to raise the
limit to $5,000 a box.

632
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,620
Put these wonderful
volunteers behind me to work.

633
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,960
Dario will take you shopping tomorrow.

634
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,000
You can spend a lot of money, have fun.

635
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:28,300
Now, give me a little kiss.

636
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,510
Want one, too?

637
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,810
We can raise the price.

638
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:38,310
$22,000 per kilo this month.

639
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:39,810
I like that.

640
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,020
Yeah, this is Truman-Lodge.

641
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,400
$22,000.

642
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,030
Our goal today is to raise...

643
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,860
$22,000 from each of our
meditation chapters.

644
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:54,910
That's $22,000 each.

645
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:58,200
Go to your phones. Please help us.

646
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:00,250
Bless your hearts.

647
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,960
Let me have half a million.

648
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:11,840
Listen to this. Our
wonderful Manhattan chapel

649
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:14,140
has just made a special $500 pledge.

650
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:18,470
Five hundred kilos. I
knew they'd go for it.

651
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,560
This guy cracks me up.

652
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,270
Is senor Sanchez there?

653
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:24,230
Yes, he's right here.

654
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:28,650
Yeah? I got a British sucker

655
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,280
who dropped a quarter of a million,

656
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,150
and he wants to play no-limit.

657
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,280
Which one?

658
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,620
Table two. Plays like a real jerk-off.

659
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:40,660
That's the guy that flew in
in the private plane today,

660
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:43,040
opened that account at the bank.

661
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,540
$5 million in cash.

662
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,010
Let him play.

663
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,430
Double down.

664
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:01,680
Split.

665
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,790
Listen to this.

666
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:32,800
Our Chicago chapel has just
received a $1,000 double pledge.

667
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,720
They all accepted the new price.

668
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,510
- Senor Sanchez.
- Yes, he's right here.

669
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:42,720
Bless your hearts.

670
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,270
The British guy is a quarter-million ahead.

671
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:48,520
Shall I close the table?

672
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:51,940
No.

673
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,450
Tell Lupe to come in here.

674
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:58,620
Right.

675
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:05,290
You have good luck tonight.

676
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,920
You gonna share any of that money?

677
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,800
Miss Kennedy, would you get me
a medium-dry vodka martini?

678
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:23,430
- Well, why don't you ask...
- Shaken, not stirred.

679
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:26,560
Cut?

680
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,490
You're very professional.

681
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:40,200
Used to work here.

682
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:42,200
Am I going to win or lose?

683
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,740
Lose, but not much.

684
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,620
Vodka martini, que?

685
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:52,000
Shaken, not stirred.

686
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:56,210
Looks like your luck has changed.

687
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,510
Is that why he sent you?

688
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,930
And to find out more about you.

689
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:03,350
Perhaps I'd better quit for the night.

690
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:08,850
You should walk straight out of here,

691
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:11,230
go to the airport and never come back.

692
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:19,740
Where's Sanchez?

693
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:21,820
Upstairs in his office.

694
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:22,990
He's been there all day.

695
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,700
He's planning a big party for
some Orientals tomorrow night.

696
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:29,370
And what did you tell him
about the Wavekrest?

697
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,080
Nothing. Now go.

698
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:36,880
Take me to him.

699
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,010
You loco? You'll get us both killed.

700
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,330
This way, please.

701
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:14,630
Send us a dollar. Send us 50 cents.

702
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:16,630
Send whatever you can send.

703
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:20,090
We've got a very special
offer for you guys out there

704
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,380
with your beer and your popcorn...

705
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:25,300
This is almost over.

706
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:30,520
This particular book has sold in excess
of a quarter of a million copies.

707
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,480
Anyone who sends in a $100 pledge or more

708
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,610
will receive a personally
autographed copy of my book,

709
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:39,030
The Secrets of Cone Power Revealed.

710
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:40,360
Lovely view.

711
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:47,080
It's a $49.95 value, and you
get it absolutely free.

712
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,740
Bond, James Bond.

713
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:50,370
Sit, please.

714
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:53,040
We need your help. Bless your hearts.

715
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,680
Well-traveled man.

716
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,010
You did all right at the tables tonight.

717
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,810
I had the feeling my luck
was about to change.

718
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:18,020
Well, it's a wise gambler who
knows when his luck has run out.

719
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:19,230
Why this?

720
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,820
In my business, you prepare
for the unexpected.

721
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:24,860
And what business is that?

722
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:27,780
I help people with problems.

723
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:29,740
Problem solver?

724
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:31,740
More of a problem eliminator.

725
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:47,260
And now you're here on business?

726
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,220
No. Temporarily unemployed.

727
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,850
I thought I might find work here.

728
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:57,100
Well, it's very difficult to
obtain a work permit in Isthmus.

729
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:03,280
Well, one has to show a special
talent that people here don't have.

730
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:08,240
Well, that shouldn't be too difficult.

731
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,950
Senor Bond, you got big cojones.

732
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:19,750
You come here to my place, without
references, carrying a piece,

733
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,790
throwing around a lot of money.

734
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,880
But you should know something...

735
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,300
Nobody saw you come in, so
nobody has to see you go out.

736
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:36,980
Senor Sanchez, I could be very
useful to a man in your position.

737
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,730
And I understand you have a reputation

738
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:41,650
for rewarding loyalty very well.

739
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:48,910
I'll keep this for a few days.
We'll talk again.

740
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:51,910
And you won't need a gun in Isthmus.

741
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:53,410
It's a very safe city.

742
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:57,160
In the meantime, I welcome you
to the casino at all times.

743
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:09,090
Check him out.

744
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,140
So what did you find out?

745
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,520
He's sitting up there behind
two inches of armored glass.

746
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:18,020
I'd need a cannon to get to him.

747
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:37,700
Senor Bond, you'll be pleased
to know your uncle has arrived.

748
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:39,790
I put him in your suite.

749
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,000
Thank you. Good night, senor.

750
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:49,840
Your uncle?

751
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:52,140
Let's make this a proper family reunion.

752
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,680
Give me a gun.

753
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:19,290
Stay here.

754
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,810
Really, 007.

755
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:43,270
Q! What the hell are you doing here?
I might have killed you!

756
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:45,060
Well, I'm on leave.

757
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:48,190
Thought I'd pop around and
see how you're getting on.

758
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,320
- You all right?
- Yes, of course I'm all right.

759
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,360
- How'd you find me?
- Well, Moneypenny, of course.

760
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:54,320
She's worried sick about you!

761
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:56,200
This is no place for you, Q. Go home.

762
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,030
Don't be an idiot, 007.

763
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,790
I know exactly what you're up to.

764
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:01,950
And quite frankly, you're
gonna need my help.

765
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,080
Remember, if it hadn't been for Q Branch,

766
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:06,210
you'd have been dead long ago.

767
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,800
Everything for a man on holiday.

768
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,260
Explosive alarm clock.

769
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:15,010
Guaranteed never to wake
up anybody who uses it.

770
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:19,140
Dentonite toothpaste, to be used sparingly.

771
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:21,310
It's the latest in plastic explosive.

772
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:22,930
I could do with some plastic.

773
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:30,530
I thought there might
be a mess to clean up.

774
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:32,360
Pam, this is Q, my uncle.

775
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,240
Uncle, this is Miss Kennedy, my cousin.

776
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,910
We must be related.

777
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:39,990
How do you do? Now, pay attention, 007.

778
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,370
Now, this looks like an
ordinary camera, doesn't it?

779
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,040
What kind of film does it take, 120?

780
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:49,630
No, .220, high-velocity.

781
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:57,550
Now, this is a signature gun, and
that is an optical palm reader.

782
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:03,680
And if I plug this into the bottom
like that, once I've programmed it...

783
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:10,730
Now, nobody can use the gun but you.

784
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:12,190
Smile, boys.

785
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,440
Don't use the flash!

786
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:22,410
Stop fiddling about with
things you don't understand!

787
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:23,830
You might easily have killed him.

788
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:25,410
That's odd.

789
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,130
Look, let's all get some rest, shall we?

790
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:34,130
We've got a long, hard day
ahead of us tomorrow.

791
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:35,630
Good night, Q.

792
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,550
Sweet dreams, Mr. Bond.

793
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,520
I hope you don't snore, Q.

794
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,940
You all know Truman-Lodge,

795
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:57,650
and this is my head of
security, Colonel Heller.

796
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:03,910
This is an historic moment.

797
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,160
East meets West.

798
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:08,660
Drug dealers of the world, unite.

799
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,920
Extra bonus. Your job's done.

800
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:17,670
Take Q and fly out of here now.

801
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,010
I'll make my own way back.

802
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:21,640
I'd like to stay.

803
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,430
No. I work better alone.

804
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,800
In this business, there's a lot of cash,

805
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,810
and with a lot of people
with their hands out.

806
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:51,770
In a word, bribery.

807
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,770
Exactly.

808
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,770
He took the words right out of my pocket.

809
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:59,730
So you pay.

810
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,190
Everyone and his brother is on the payroll.

811
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:09,450
So you buy a mayor, a chief
of police, a general,

812
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,130
Presidents.

813
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:19,300
One day you wake up, you own
the whole goddamn country.

814
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,960
Then you take what you want.

815
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:25,050
Bank, a gambling casino,
airline concession.

816
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,640
Why?

817
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:32,220
Simple. It's easier for the
politicians to take silver than lead.

818
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:36,730
We have an invisible empire
from Chile to Alaska.

819
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:43,610
What I want to do, amigos,
is to make you part of it.

820
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:47,200
I want the Pacific to be our little puddle.

821
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:53,080
What you have before you,
gentlemen, is a demographic report,

822
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:56,420
breaking down each of your territories

823
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:59,840
by age and socioeconomic group.

824
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,380
Now, as you can clearly see, there
is a huge potential demand,

825
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:07,840
given the implementation
of aggressive marketing.

826
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:09,850
As in the United States,

827
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:14,930
Senor Sanchez is prepared to offer
each of you exclusive franchises.

828
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:19,520
The price is $100 million per territory.

829
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:26,280
I believe you'll find that works out to
$20 million per metric ton, Mr. Tan.

830
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:49,680
We guarantee quality and
price for five years.

831
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,810
Senor Sanchez,

832
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:55,680
since arriving, we've eaten well,

833
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:57,770
heard many good stories,

834
01:18:57,850 --> 01:19:01,810
but before I pay anything, I
want to see some hardware.

835
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:06,900
Mr. Kwang, you don't pay for hardware.

836
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:10,660
You pay for my personal
guarantee and protection.

837
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:13,580
Surely, if you were to invest $100 million,

838
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:15,830
you would want some reassurance.

839
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,790
You know, you're right. Why not?

840
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,380
Tomorrow, I'll take you to our
main distribution center.

841
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:31,010
Here you are.

842
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:34,890
Goodbye, Q. Thanks for all you've done.

843
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,140
What?

844
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:39,940
You're a hell of a field operative.

845
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:42,230
Now, go. I'll see you back in London.

846
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,530
No more business.

847
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:57,040
Gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.

848
01:19:57,870 --> 01:19:59,080
Hi, there!

849
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,330
- Hi!
- How are you?

850
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,890
This Kwang, he seems like trouble.

851
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:17,560
Why show them the labs?

852
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:21,440
Don't worry. He won't expose the operation.

853
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:48,340
His Excellency, el Presidente Lopez.

854
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,360
There's been a mistake with my check.

855
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,240
Look at it. It's half the usual amount.

856
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:15,700
You were very quiet when I was arrested.

857
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:21,000
Remember, you're only President for life.

858
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:50,400
Watch the birdie, you bastard.

859
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:50,170
Take his arm.

860
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:58,220
Who'd have a signature gun?

861
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,140
James Bond.

862
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,930
This is the property of
Her Majesty's government.

863
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:07,100
How did you get it?

864
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:08,190
Piss off.

865
01:23:08,270 --> 01:23:09,650
Who ordered you to kill Sanchez?

866
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:11,770
No one. He's a rogue agent.

867
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:15,070
I've got orders to take him
back, one way or the other.

868
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:17,820
We're Hong Kong Narcotics, you bastard!

869
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:20,910
Sanchez is taking us to the
heart of his operations.

870
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,580
I've been setting it up for years!

871
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:27,500
I just hope that little stunt
of yours hasn't scared him off.

872
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:33,380
Get me out of these bloody things.

873
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:36,800
No, Commander. You're a
loose cannon on deck.

874
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,260
I'm shipping you straight back to London.

875
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:47,100
- Leave him!
- No!

876
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:48,430
Come on!

877
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,290
Don't let them take you alive.

878
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,000
He's still alive.

879
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:02,170
Who was it? Who sent you?

880
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:07,640
Cyanide.

881
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:20,670
Hey, amigo!

882
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,680
How do you feel?

883
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,890
I'll survive.

884
01:26:33,810 --> 01:26:35,310
Lupe, please.

885
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:43,190
The Wavekrest is arriving tonight.
Krest is coming here.

886
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:45,400
No, no, no, I'll call you back.

887
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:46,860
Pedro, bring us some coffee, por favor.

888
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:48,110
Good.

889
01:26:51,490 --> 01:26:53,660
Baby, please?

890
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:07,970
Well, we both had close calls last night.

891
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:09,340
You were just in time.

892
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:11,300
Things were about to turn nasty.

893
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:13,060
Who were those guys?

894
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:14,100
Freelance hit team.

895
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:15,770
What did they want with you?

896
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,810
One of them must have
recognized me in the casino.

897
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,940
They were afraid I'd warn
you, spoil their plans.

898
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:29,280
So you knew them?

899
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,200
I used to work for the British government.

900
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,990
We kept dossiers on such people.

901
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:35,490
British agent.

902
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,460
I knew it.

903
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:43,880
You have class.

904
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:47,340
Those men tried to kill me.

905
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:50,090
Who would do such a thing?

906
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,510
Someone close to you.

907
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:52,890
Cream? Sugar?

908
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:55,310
No.

909
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:57,270
Did they tell you this?

910
01:27:57,350 --> 01:28:01,100
They were well-briefed, obviously
by someone on the inside.

911
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,690
Did they mention a name?

912
01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:05,860
No.

913
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:12,780
Only that they were expecting
to be paid a great deal of cash

914
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:15,580
by someone arriving in Isthmus tonight.

915
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:19,910
You suspect someone?

916
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:24,580
Everyone in my organization is 100% loyal.

917
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:25,960
Then you have nothing to worry about.

918
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:28,920
Yeah, well, I have to go meet some people.

919
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:32,260
Why don't you rest here?

920
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,800
No. I have to go back to my hotel.

921
01:28:33,890 --> 01:28:38,180
No. Don't go to the hotel.
Save your money. I insist.

922
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:41,270
Stay here. Enjoy my hospitality.

923
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:43,900
Lupe, show him the easy way up, please.

924
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:04,250
You are not gonna believe who this guy is.

925
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:10,380
Former British agent.

926
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:11,920
How did you know that?

927
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:13,550
Because I know things.

928
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:18,510
I want to meet Krest's boat tonight.

929
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,310
We'll need a dozen reliable men.

930
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:23,020
Is there a problem with Krest?

931
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:26,480
We'll see. And bring Lupe. She was there.

932
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,940
He's not gonna lie in front of her.

933
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:34,240
What are you doing?

934
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,370
I've had my fill of Sanchez's hospitality.

935
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:38,780
He told you to stay. You're
asking for big trouble.

936
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:41,040
Look, there's no need for
you to get involved.

937
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,040
Just give me five minutes,
then scream your head off.

938
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,710
James, please, listen to me.

939
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:46,250
There's guards all over the place.

940
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:47,540
You'll never make it.

941
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:22,410
I'm going shopping. I won't be long.

942
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,120
Please don't. Not now.

943
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:25,710
Senor Sanchez said.

944
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,230
I haven't had one of these in five years.

945
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:48,690
Don't worry. 007 always comes back.

946
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,150
James, hi.

947
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,320
I thought I told you to leave, Q.

948
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:58,240
We couldn't go without knowing
what had happened to you.

949
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,570
Get your bags packed, Q.

950
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:01,580
What the hell is the matter with you?

951
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:03,330
Just a couple of things.

952
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:05,580
Kwang and his team of
British agents are dead.

953
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:07,210
Sanchez is alive.

954
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:09,290
I saw you in Heller's office.

955
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:11,130
You're working with them. No.

956
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:14,800
I want the truth. I am telling the truth.

957
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,550
Sanchez has arranged to buy four
Stinger missiles from the Contras,

958
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:20,640
and he's threatened to shoot
down an American airliner

959
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,010
if the DEA doesn't lay off.

960
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:23,810
What's that got to do with you and Heller?

961
01:31:23,890 --> 01:31:26,220
Felix gave me a letter at his
wedding from the Attorney General

962
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:29,770
granting Heller immunity if
he gets the Stingers back.

963
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:33,570
Did he go for the deal?

964
01:31:34,610 --> 01:31:35,940
Yes.

965
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,910
And then you missed Sanchez,

966
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:42,990
and Heller panicked and
he said the deal was off,

967
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:47,750
and that I was dead if
he ever saw me again.

968
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:51,040
There's more to this than
your personal vendetta.

969
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:58,130
It's a mess.

970
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:03,180
Sanchez has tripled his security.

971
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:07,560
You'll never get another shot at him.

972
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,110
We don't have to.

973
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:20,030
Meet me at the harbor
master's office in two hours.

974
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:22,570
Q, bring the Rolls round
to the front of the hotel.

975
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:24,280
Yes, sir.

976
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:28,040
Senor Bond.

977
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:30,910
Senor Montelongo, I'm making a withdrawal.

978
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:51,850
Pilot coming aboard, sir.

979
01:32:55,730 --> 01:32:57,900
Well? Take me to the bridge.

980
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:06,410
Gracias, Captain. I'll take over now.

981
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:09,120
You? You're the harbor pilot?

982
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,410
No, I'm his secretary!

983
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:13,710
All yours, sir... Ma'am.

984
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:32,020
Do you think you're going
in a bit too fast?

985
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:35,020
You wanna do the driving?
You take the wheel.

986
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:46,700
Full speed astern.

987
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,790
What the hell are you doing?

988
01:33:54,870 --> 01:33:56,120
Check the forward component!

989
01:33:56,210 --> 01:33:57,580
Harbor pilot went crazy.

990
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:34,330
I'd stick to flying if I were you.

991
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:36,080
I got the job done.

992
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:50,850
Franz, what a surprise!

993
01:34:50,930 --> 01:34:52,680
I didn't think you'd be here.

994
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:54,850
Yeah. I like surprises.

995
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:02,860
You seem to be having a
lot of problems lately.

996
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:06,950
Well, we had this crazy harbor pilot.

997
01:35:07,030 --> 01:35:09,700
Let's talk about the money you owe me.

998
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:12,950
Why don't we talk inside.

999
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:22,090
- Does he have a safe?
- Not up here. Maybe below.

1000
01:35:24,130 --> 01:35:25,760
Have a look around.

1001
01:35:38,350 --> 01:35:39,850
Do I have this right?

1002
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:42,690
He water-skied behind the
plane, jumps on it...

1003
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:46,320
No, no. He was...

1004
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:47,570
Well, yeah.

1005
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:49,650
He threw the pilots out and flew away.

1006
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,030
Like a little bird.

1007
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,840
The knife.

1008
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:23,770
Pedro.

1009
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:42,500
Would I make up a story like that?
You must have seen something.

1010
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:57,350
- Where's 007?
- He's coming.

1011
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,990
That's not my money. I swear.

1012
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:17,240
That's right, amigo. It's mine.

1013
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:24,330
You think I'm stupid, huh?

1014
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:28,590
You rip me off, then use my own
money to pay someone to kill me?

1015
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:31,630
You want it so bad? Then take it!

1016
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,390
What are you doing?

1017
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:41,100
Wait. Let me talk. It's not my money!

1018
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:48,440
No! What the...

1019
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:50,690
That hurts. Please!

1020
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:58,700
What are you doing?

1021
01:37:58,780 --> 01:38:00,290
Sanchez.

1022
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:11,750
Please, Franz. No!

1023
01:38:27,150 --> 01:38:29,480
What about the money, patron?

1024
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:33,070
Launder it.

1025
01:38:50,290 --> 01:38:51,670
This is where you leave.

1026
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,920
Take the plane. I'll see you both in Miami.

1027
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:55,420
Aren't you coming?

1028
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:59,090
No. They'll be after me.
It'll be safer on my own.

1029
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:13,570
Come on, my dear.

1030
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:24,540
See you later.

1031
01:39:29,170 --> 01:39:30,330
What's that?

1032
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:31,880
Bond's clothes. They're clean.

1033
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:52,360
Sorry to wake you, hermano.

1034
01:39:57,530 --> 01:40:01,320
I thought you'd like to know the
information you gave me paid off.

1035
01:40:01,410 --> 01:40:03,740
I got the guy who set me up.

1036
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:06,200
Only one guy?

1037
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:07,830
What do you mean?

1038
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:10,210
I just thought that

1039
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:14,920
no one would be stupid enough to
try to take you on on their own.

1040
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:27,600
Listen, I want you to
come with me tomorrow.

1041
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:30,390
Where are we going?

1042
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:33,270
It's a surprise. You're gonna like it.

1043
01:40:48,330 --> 01:40:50,620
James, what are you doing back here?

1044
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:52,870
I don't think your being
here's a good idea, Lupe.

1045
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,000
It's all right. Franz is having
dinner with the Chinese.

1046
01:40:58,210 --> 01:40:59,760
Do you know where he's taking me tomorrow?

1047
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,590
He's showing them a special place.

1048
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:03,470
I don't know where.

1049
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:07,510
James, don't go. I'm scared.
What's gonna happen to us?

1050
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:08,810
Don't worry.

1051
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:11,140
When this is all over, I'll
make sure you get back home.

1052
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:14,060
Home? It took me 15 years
to get away from there.

1053
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:16,980
I don't wanna go back.

1054
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:19,570
Can't we leave together?

1055
01:41:19,650 --> 01:41:21,150
I'll be safe with you.

1056
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:29,990
No, Lupe. I don't think
that would work out.

1057
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,330
How can we tell unless we try?

1058
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:42,550
I think it's gonna work out very well.

1059
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:51,680
All right. I'll answer it.

1060
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:58,690
Miss Kennedy, I saw you
at the casino with James.

1061
01:41:58,770 --> 01:42:01,190
We need to speak in private.

1062
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,570
It's all right. He's with me.

1063
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:05,320
James is in danger. Sanchez is no fool.

1064
01:42:05,410 --> 01:42:10,030
He's checking up on him. You know,
if they find anything suspicious...

1065
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:12,620
Listen, it's all right. He's
safely out of the country by now.

1066
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:13,910
You don't understand.

1067
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,580
Last night, he stayed with me.

1068
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:21,170
At Sanchez's house?

1069
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:23,130
Si. Franz is taking him on a trip.

1070
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:25,300
They leave in an hour. You must help him.

1071
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:28,010
If anything happens to him,
I don't know what I'll do.

1072
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,970
You know, I love James so much.

1073
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:32,310
Look, you must go before you're missed.

1074
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:36,310
Now, don't worry. We'll think of something.

1075
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:41,190
"I love James so much." I'll
be damned if I'll help him.

1076
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:44,490
Look, don't judge him too harshly, my dear.

1077
01:42:44,570 --> 01:42:47,740
Field operatives must often use
every means at their disposal

1078
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:50,450
to achieve their objectives.

1079
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:51,830
Bullshit.

1080
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,510
Bond's just left in convoy.
Two cars and a Jeep,

1081
01:43:08,590 --> 01:43:10,430
turning north onto the main highway.

1082
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:12,720
- I copy that, Q.
- Over and out.

1083
01:43:22,150 --> 01:43:24,650
What are you doing to my plane?

1084
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:27,950
Overhaul. Senor Sanchez order it.

1085
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:33,580
I must have a plane. Where can I rent one?

1086
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:36,580
No planes.

1087
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:48,760
You brought the Stingers, manito.

1088
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:51,140
From now on, I want them close to me.

1089
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:25,130
We started this place strictly as a cover,

1090
01:44:25,210 --> 01:44:29,010
but Professor Joe manages
to turn a tidy profit.

1091
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:54,870
Welcome. This way, please.

1092
01:44:56,030 --> 01:44:59,160
I'm going to have to ask that
each of you put on one of these.

1093
01:44:59,250 --> 01:45:04,080
It's for your own safety, so
I'm sure you'll understand.

1094
01:45:04,170 --> 01:45:09,130
We can't have our best customers
developing a drug habit.

1095
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:12,130
This way, gentlemen.

1096
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:54,510
Our product dissolves completely
in ordinary gasoline,

1097
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:57,470
making it absolutely undetectable.

1098
01:46:02,310 --> 01:46:03,560
How do you get it back?

1099
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:09,770
Hey, you want us to tell you all
our secrets before we're partners?

1100
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:11,360
Take them to the lab.

1101
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:13,070
This way, gentlemen.

1102
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:25,460
Who's the new guy?

1103
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:27,960
Somebody I thought could be useful.

1104
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:41,810
Can I help you?

1105
01:46:41,890 --> 01:46:44,020
I have a special surprise
for Professor Joe.

1106
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:45,560
Sorry. No visitors this week.

1107
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:47,980
I came all the way from Wichita Falls.

1108
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:50,230
- I'm sorry.
- The folks back home took up a collection.

1109
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:53,030
They'd be so disappointed if Professor
Joe didn't accept it personally.

1110
01:46:55,450 --> 01:46:59,530
You may remove your masks now, gentlemen.

1111
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:01,950
So, do we have a deal?

1112
01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:07,080
The terms, gentlemen,

1113
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:10,920
were $100 million in negotiable
bearer bonds from each of you.

1114
01:47:12,670 --> 01:47:13,670
Welcome.

1115
01:47:23,350 --> 01:47:25,310
Professor Joe. It's really you!

1116
01:47:28,270 --> 01:47:30,060
It's magnificent.

1117
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:34,780
Rebuilt stone for stone and restored
to all of its original glory.

1118
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:35,900
Is this for me?

1119
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:38,610
Yes, I almost forgot. I got so flustered...

1120
01:47:40,410 --> 01:47:44,200
Tell me, child, have you ever
thought of studying here?

1121
01:47:44,290 --> 01:47:45,790
Would that be possible?

1122
01:47:45,870 --> 01:47:48,410
Come along. Let's see if
you have the aptitude.

1123
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,960
To a long association.

1124
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:53,090
What's the process?

1125
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:54,300
It's very simple.

1126
01:47:57,340 --> 01:48:02,550
An 18% mixture of cocaine
and ordinary gasoline.

1127
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,260
Just keep quiet.

1128
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:31,870
We already have your first shipment being
loaded into the four tanker trucks.

1129
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:34,210
Welcome, my dear.

1130
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:37,880
Please join me.

1131
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:47,060
This is my humble sanctuary away
from the cares of the world.

1132
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:50,480
Your own private meditation chamber.

1133
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:53,850
Built from the sacred rocks
of the original temple.

1134
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:02,400
I did have it soundproofed, so
nothing will disturb our meditation.

1135
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:08,950
I brought you another surprise.

1136
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:10,960
I love surprises. Where is it?

1137
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:24,470
Look, this really isn't necessary.

1138
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:28,810
Give me the keys.

1139
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:43,950
Bless your heart.

1140
01:49:44,450 --> 01:49:47,700
Your monthly delivery will
be by ocean-going tanker.

1141
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:53,120
We'll send our chief chemist along to
supervise the reconversion process.

1142
01:49:53,210 --> 01:49:57,540
You'll keep the gas as a bonus.

1143
01:49:57,630 --> 01:50:01,380
And if there's a problem
with customs, no evidence.

1144
01:50:14,980 --> 01:50:16,520
Come on, hurry!

1145
01:50:23,610 --> 01:50:25,820
I know him. He's an informer.

1146
01:50:28,530 --> 01:50:30,410
You disappoint me.

1147
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:34,660
Who are you working for, huh? Tell me.

1148
01:50:39,380 --> 01:50:41,170
You don't wanna talk?

1149
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:59,650
I can get the trucks out, but I
don't think I can control the fire.

1150
01:50:59,730 --> 01:51:03,440
Forget the fire. Get some cars. We're
gonna take the tankers with us.

1151
01:51:03,530 --> 01:51:06,490
Wait a minute. This setup
cost us $32 million.

1152
01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:07,950
We have to try and save it.

1153
01:51:08,030 --> 01:51:09,780
I don't give a shit about the setup.

1154
01:51:09,870 --> 01:51:11,990
We've got $500 million in the case and

1155
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:14,370
20 tons of Colombian pure in the tankers.

1156
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:15,580
Now go help Heller.

1157
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:18,750
But we have a deal with the Orientals.
We've got their money.

1158
01:51:18,830 --> 01:51:20,500
I said go help Heller.

1159
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:30,510
Now, do you wanna make this hard or easy?

1160
01:51:35,890 --> 01:51:37,850
Put him in the conveyor.

1161
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:50,820
When you're up to your ankles,

1162
01:51:50,910 --> 01:51:52,870
you're gonna beg to tell me everything.

1163
01:51:52,950 --> 01:51:56,790
When you're up to your knees,
you'll kiss my ass to kill you.

1164
01:52:01,790 --> 01:52:03,590
I'm the least of your problems, Sanchez.

1165
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:06,800
If you couldn't trust
Krest, who can you trust?

1166
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:12,340
Who's got your $500 million?

1167
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:13,970
Truman-Lodge?

1168
01:52:17,350 --> 01:52:19,350
What about the Stingers?

1169
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:24,940
What do you know about Stingers?

1170
01:52:27,990 --> 01:52:31,070
We gotta go, patron. This
place'll blow up any second.

1171
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:32,110
Where's Heller?

1172
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:33,240
I don't know.

1173
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:36,830
That's the last you'll see
of Heller and your Stingers.

1174
01:52:41,330 --> 01:52:43,210
Thanks for the advice.

1175
01:52:56,510 --> 01:52:59,310
Have my car meet me up at the top.
Braun, come with me.

1176
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:39,220
You're dead.

1177
01:53:39,310 --> 01:53:42,060
You took the words right out of my mouth.

1178
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:54,610
Sanchez!

1179
01:54:02,910 --> 01:54:04,750
Are you all right?

1180
01:54:04,830 --> 01:54:06,750
Switch the bloody machine off.

1181
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:24,390
Hey. I was making sure these were secure.

1182
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:28,190
It's a good idea. Take them up to my car.

1183
01:54:28,610 --> 01:54:29,820
Of course.

1184
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:16,360
Oh, God. It's Heller.

1185
01:55:16,450 --> 01:55:18,360
Yeah. Looks like he came to a dead end.

1186
01:55:18,450 --> 01:55:19,700
Come on.

1187
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:35,960
Come on! Come on! Follow me!

1188
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:46,270
You. Come with me.

1189
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:06,450
Come on.

1190
01:56:22,010 --> 01:56:23,430
Surprise!

1191
01:56:25,390 --> 01:56:27,180
Bless your heart!

1192
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:15,960
Perez.

1193
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,420
Bond has escaped.

1194
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:19,880
Meet me at Paso del Diablo.

1195
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:13,270
Don't worry. It's only money.

1196
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:41,920
Okay, que pase.

1197
02:01:35,410 --> 02:01:37,370
Oh, no.

1198
02:01:39,660 --> 02:01:41,040
Shit!

1199
02:01:53,380 --> 02:01:56,090
Brilliant.

1200
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:57,970
Well done, Franz.

1201
02:01:58,060 --> 02:02:01,980
Another $80 million write-off.

1202
02:02:02,060 --> 02:02:04,350
I guess it's time to
start cutting overhead.

1203
02:04:09,230 --> 02:04:11,480
Dame el Stinger!

1204
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:14,040
James!

1205
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:11,910
You could have had everything.

1206
02:07:11,990 --> 02:07:13,950
Don't you want to know why?

1207
02:08:14,010 --> 02:08:16,180
What are you waiting for? Get in.

1208
02:08:17,770 --> 02:08:19,060
Yes, sir.

1209
02:08:31,910 --> 02:08:33,870
I'll be up to see you next week.
We'll do some fishing.

1210
02:08:33,950 --> 02:08:36,450
Good. I'll be out by then. M called.

1211
02:08:36,540 --> 02:08:40,040
He tried to reach you. I think
he may have a job for you.

1212
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:43,250
Look, Felix, I have to go.
My hostess has just arrived.

1213
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:44,340
Take care, James.

1214
02:08:44,420 --> 02:08:46,090
You, too. Goodbye.

1215
02:08:49,010 --> 02:08:50,260
I thought you hated that thing.

1216
02:08:50,340 --> 02:08:53,850
Don't you know, iguanas
are a girl's best friend.

1217
02:09:01,310 --> 02:09:03,480
Well, here's to you, my dear.

1218
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:05,020
Cheers.

1219
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:08,900
Thank you for everything, James.

1220
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:13,660
Thank you.

1221
02:09:26,130 --> 02:09:28,380
You could stay here with me.

1222
02:09:29,670 --> 02:09:30,760
Excuse me.

1223
02:09:43,060 --> 02:09:46,690
I think you and el Presidente
will make a perfect couple.

1224
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:22,390
Why don't you wait until you're asked?

1225
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:25,060
So, why don't you ask me?

1226
02:10:30,610 --> 02:10:34,900
Used to be that I believed in something.

1227
02:10:36,200 --> 02:10:40,330
Used to be that I believed in love.

1228
02:10:41,410 --> 02:10:46,120
It's been a long time since
I've had that feeling

1229
02:10:46,210 --> 02:10:52,380
I could love someone I could trust someone

1230
02:10:52,460 --> 02:10:57,970
I said I'd never let nobody
near my heart again, darling

1231
02:10:58,050 --> 02:11:03,600
I said I'd never let nobody in.

1232
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:09,060
If you asked me to

1233
02:11:09,150 --> 02:11:15,700
I just might change my mind And
let you in my life forever.

1234
02:11:15,780 --> 02:11:20,200
If you asked me to

1235
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:26,710
I just might give my heart And
stay here in your arms forever.

1236
02:11:26,790 --> 02:11:31,290
If you asked me to.

1237
02:11:33,130 --> 02:11:37,930
Somehow ever since I've been around you.

1238
02:11:38,640 --> 02:11:43,220
Can't go back to being on my own.

1239
02:11:44,180 --> 02:11:48,640
Can't help feeling, darling
Since I've found you.

1240
02:11:48,730 --> 02:11:54,900

If you.

02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:55,040
