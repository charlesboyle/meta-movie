2
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,211
<i>Ever had
one of those nights</i>

3
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,968
<i>that starts out like any other, but ends
up being the best night of your life?</i>

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,808
<i>It was June the 22nd,
1990, our final day of school.</i>

5
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:52,082
<i>There was Oliver Chamberlain, Peter Page,
Steven Prince, Andy Knightley and me.</i>

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,963
<i>They called me The King.
Because my name's Gary King.</i>

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,888
<i>Ollie was funny, he fancied himself as a bit
of a player, but really, he was all mouth.</i>

8
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,371
<i>We called him</i> O-Man

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,205
<i>because he had a birthmark on his
forehead that looked like a six.</i>

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,248
<i>He loved it.</i>

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,568
<i>Pete was the baby
of the group.</i>

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,087
<i>He wasn't the kind of kid we'd usually
hang outwith, but he was good for a laugh.</i>

13
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,011
<i>And he was absolutely minted.</i>

14
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,722
<i>Steve was a pretty cool guy. We
jammed together, chased the girls.</i>

15
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,009
<i>I think he saw us as rivals.
Sweet, really.</i>

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,084
<i>And Andy.
Andy was my wingman.</i>

17
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,004
<i>The one guy I could rely
on to back me up.</i>

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,687
<i>He loved me, and I'm not being
funny, but I loved him, too.</i>

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,171
<i>There was nothing we were
gonna miss about school-</i>

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,361
<i>Maybe Mr. Shepherd.</i>

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,090
<i>He was definitely
one of the good guys.</i>

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,561
<i>He used to ask me what I
wanted to do with my life.</i>

23
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,524
<i>I told him I just wanted
to have a good time.</i>

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,605
<i>He thought that was funny.
It wasn't meant to be.</i>

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,051
<i>Not that night.</i>

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,046
<i>Newton Haven was our hometown.
Our playground, our universe.</i>

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,044
<i>And that night it was the
site of a heroic quest.</i>

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,090
<i>The aim? To conquer
The Golden Mile.</i>

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,325
<i>Twelve pubs along a legendary
path of alcoholic indulgence.</i>

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,448
<i>There was The First Post,
The Old Familiar,</i>

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,046
<i>The Famous Cock, The Cross
Hands, The Good Companions,</i>

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,090
<i>The Trusty Servant, The Two Headed
Dog, The Mermaid, The Beehive,</i>

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,770
<i>The King's Head,
The Hole in the Wall...</i>

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,084
<i>All before reaching our
destiny, The World's End.</i>

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,526
<i>We took my car into town.</i>

36
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,723
<i>I called it The Beast
because she was pretty hairy.</i>

37
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,811
<i>And so, our journey into manhood began.</i>

38
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,451
<i>We were off.
We didn't waste any time.</i>

39
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,768
<i>We hit pub one
and we hit it hard.</i>

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,329
<i>There was drinking, there was
fun, there was controversy,</i>

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,324
<i>there were ladies, there
were shots, there was drama,</i>

42
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,324
<i>and of course,
there was drinking.</i>

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,242
<i>By pub five,
we were feeling invincible</i>

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,727
<i>and decided to purchase
some herbal refreshment</i>

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,610
<i>from a man we called
The Reverend Green.</i>

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,923
<i>Pint six put O-Man out of commission,
so we carried on without him.</i>

47
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,611
<i>Good thing, I bumped into
his sister in the next pub,</i>

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,451
<i>we went into the disableds
and I bumped into her again.</i>

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,809
<i>Sam tagged along for a while,
but then I had to let her go.</i>

50
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,601
<i>I had another date that night
and her name was Amber.</i>

51
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,484
<i>Nine pints in and it was us
against the world.</i>

52
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,005
<i>Things got mental
in The Beehive,</i>

53
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,570
<i>so we repaired to
the bowls club</i>

54
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,885
<i>or as we liked to call it, The Smokehouse,
which is when it all went fuck up.</i>

55
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,244
<i>Everyone got para and Pete chucked
a whitey, so we had to bench him.</i>

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,369
<i>In the end, we blew off the last
three pubs and headed for the hills.</i>

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,931
<i>I remember sitting up there,</i>

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,083
<i>blood on my knuckles, beer down
my shirt, sick on my shoes,</i>

59
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,481
<i>seeing the orange glow
of a new dawn break</i>

60
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,486
<i>and knowing in my heart, life
would never feel this good again.</i>

61
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,886
<i>And you know what?</i>

62
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,807
It never did.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,163
Thank you, Gary.
That was very enlightening.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,846
Would anyone like to add anything
or maybe challenge Gary?

65
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,604
Are you disappointed?

66
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,571
About what? That you didn't
make it to The World's End?

67
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,601
No.

68
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,967
<i>Just what is it
that you want to do?</i>

69
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,963
<i>We want to be free!</i>

70
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,044
<i>We want to be free to do
what we want to do!</i>

71
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,441
<i>And we want to get loaded. And
we want to have a good time.</i>

72
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,090
<i>And that's what
we're going to do.</i>

73
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,730
<i>We're going to have
a good time.</i>

74
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,847
<i>We're going to have a party.</i>

75
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,728
<i>Just what is it
that you want to do?</i>

76
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,049
<i>And we want to get loaded.
And we want to have a good time.</i>

77
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,650
She's a beauty.
Yeah, but she's no Beast.

78
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,484
Hello, Peter.

79
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,608
Jesus! Gary?

80
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,769
The once and future King.

81
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,285
Were you outside my
house this morning?

82
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,566
No.

83
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,205
I could have sworn
I saw you on my street.

84
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,169
I've never been
to Bishop's Gardens.

85
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,446
How you doing, man?

86
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,887
I'm well. You?
Yeah, never better.

87
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,530
How is, uh...
Vanessa?

88
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,005
No. Your wife?
Vanessa.

89
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,208
Yeah. How's she?
She's good.

90
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,567
Have you had sex yet?
We have two children.

91
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,450
Ooh, twice. Get you, fuck machine.

92
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,760
We haven't changed, have we?

93
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,046
What is he doing here?

94
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,088
It's all right, Dad.
We're fine.

95
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,605
Hi, Mr. P.

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,564
So, Gary,
how can I help you?

97
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,483
He looks well. Are you
looking to buy a car?

98
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,801
Uh... No.
I'm afraid the end is nigh.

99
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,481
What?
The World's End.

100
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,607
What do you mean?

101
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,321
You know what I mean. One night.
Five guys. Twelve pubs.

102
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,731
Let battle commence.

103
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,966
You want to try
that again?

104
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,610
Yeah, isn't that something
you've always wanted?

105
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,842
Not particularly. No.
Look. Peter.

106
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,050
We didn't make it before, but this time, we're
gonna see it through to the bitter end.

107
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,167
Or lager end.

108
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,810
We?
Yeah, the whole gang.

109
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,571
Even Andy? Why wouldn't
Andy be coming?

110
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,604
Well, I thought that after the accident...
Not an issue. He's in.

111
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,967
What we wanna
know is are you?

112
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,769
I'd have to check
with Vanessa.

113
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,610
Who's Vanessa?
My wife.

114
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,284
Since when have you had to
check with your wife?

115
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,327
Since we got married.

116
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,448
Oh, come on, man,
don't you miss it?

117
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,127
The laughs, the
camaraderie, the fights,

118
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,931
the hangovers so fierce it feels
like your head is full of ants.

119
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,121
Maybe the first two.

120
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,203
It begins.
What's your new number?

121
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,685
Same one I've had
for 10 years.

122
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,961
Yeah. What's that one?

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,369
This entire row here, they'll all have
dormer windows above the front elevation.

124
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,363
Who's the helmet
without an helmet?

125
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,887
That's Gary King.

126
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,164
Knock, knock.

127
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,049
What are you
doing here, Gary?

128
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,650
You're supposed to say,
"Who's there?"

129
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,764
I can see who's there.
It's you.

130
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,249
I like what you've done
with the place. Bit draughty.

131
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,971
How's Selina?
We divorced 10 years ago.

132
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,844
Yeah, I know, just
wondered how she was.

133
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,366
She's doing very well,
apparently.

134
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,771
Have you got anyone
else on the go?

135
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,447
Yeah, I do, as it happens. She's a
fitness instructor. Twenty-six.

136
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,245
Pedophile. I'm kidding.
I'd love to meet her sometime.

137
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,850
No. Why are you here?

138
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,527
Haven't you heard? We're getting
the band back together.

139
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,690
I'm not your
bass player anymore.

140
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,762
No, I mean we're getting
the boys back together.

141
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,444
We can get the band back
together as well if you want.

142
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,848
No, we can't. You sold
my guitar to buy drugs.

143
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,163
I've always wondered, what's
that thing over the door called?

144
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,241
That's a lintel.

145
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,364
So, the plan is, we're going
to go back to Newton Haven,

146
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,566
we are gonna do
The Golden Mile

147
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,530
and this time, we are gonna
make it to The World's End.

148
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,886
Everybody's in.

149
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,086
What, even Andy?

150
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,685
Oh, you better
believe it, big balls.

151
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,445
Andy is going drinking with you?
With us.

152
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,047
Think about it, go back to the
old town, sink a few pints...

153
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,770
Twelve pints.
Yeah.

154
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,008
Twelve pints is insane.
I know!

155
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,130
What is this
all about, Gary?

156
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,841
It's about closure,
you know.

157
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,003
Why should getting older affect
something as important as friendship?

158
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,964
A lot's changed since then, Oliver.
Right.

159
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,721
This is our chance
to take stock.

160
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,802
A stock take?
You make it sound so much fun.

161
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,042
Come on, O-Man. Isn't that
something you'd like?

162
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,521
What I'd really like is for you
to take your DMs off the sofa.

163
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,604
Look. If you're worried about
me, don't be. All right?

164
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,763
I'm here to tell you that Gary
King is back on the horse.

165
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,650
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're back on the horse?

166
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,767
No, I mean
I'm back on the bike.

167
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,006
What is bike?
What do you mean?

168
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,650
What is bike slang for?
Bicycle.

169
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,767
I'm lost.
Don't be.

170
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,001
Okay.
Listen.

171
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,731
This is our chance to finally
finish what we started.

172
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,491
Come on, man,
it'll be fucking mental!

173
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,404
I think we're all done.
So...

174
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,925
How do you like
the property?

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,923
Yeah. It's amazing.
Amazing location.

176
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,684
Fantastic.
Fantastic aspects.

177
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,525
It's just... It's just a little
bit out of our price range.

178
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,409
He'll knock some off for you.
What's it down for?

179
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,409
1.2 million.
Fuck off!

180
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,089
You have my card.

181
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,288
Gary, WTF?

182
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,850
It's good to see you,
too, O-Man.

183
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,490
Please don't call me O-Man.
Sure.

184
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,403
Hey, how's your sister?
She's fine.

185
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,606
She talk about me?
No.

186
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,444
So, Friday, we'll all
go down together.

187
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,931
Make a road trip of it,
I'll drive.

188
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,520
Don't think I can. I think I've
got a doctor's appointment.

189
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,205
Yeah, you do.
With Dr. Ink!

190
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,371
You know, Dr. Ink?
Yeah. "Drink." I get it.

191
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,245
Come on. It wouldn't be the
same without the O-Man.

192
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,287
Jesus.

193
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,251
You can see the guys, see how they're doing.
Tell them how you're doing.

194
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,800
You never know, you might
make it to the end this time.

195
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,081
And Andy's definitely coming?
Yeah.

196
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,646
Andy Knightley?
Totes.

197
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,882
And you convinced him how?

198
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,088
Mr. Knightley.
Felicity.

199
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,929
You have a friend
here to see you.

200
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,091
No, I don't.

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,651
This is a bit grown up, isn't it?
Yup.

202
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,006
Saw the boys the other day.
Mmm-hmm.

203
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,243
O-Man, Stevie-Baby,
the Petertron.

204
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,522
Yeah, I remember the names of
our childhood friends, Gary.

205
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,683
We had ourselves
a little idea.

206
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,807
Did you now?

207
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,450
Yeah. We're going to go
back to Newton Haven.

208
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,764
Why? For some
unfinished business.

209
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,131
That's a joke, right?

210
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,006
Five guys. Twelve pubs. Fifty pints.
Sixty pints.

211
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,969
Steady on,
you fucking alky.

212
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,242
I haven't had a drink
for 16 years, Gary.

213
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,209
You must be thirsty then.

214
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,523
We can go back, see the guys, chew the
fat, it'll be just like it always was,

215
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,444
except this time we're going to
finish this thing once and for all.

216
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,171
You have a very selective
memory, Gary. Thanks.

217
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,890
You remember
the Friday nights.

218
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,086
I remember the
Monday mornings.

219
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,242
Yeah, that's why we're
going back on a Friday.

220
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,206
Why do you think none of
us live in Newton Haven anymore?

221
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,847
I don't know. Because it's a black hole.
It's boring.

222
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,684
It always was
and it always will be.

223
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,127
It's only boring
because we're not there.

224
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,204
It's pointless arguing with you.
Exactly. So come.

225
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,921
I'm picking everybody up from High
Wycombe station, Friday, 3:00 sharp.

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,001
No, Gary.

227
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,401
Oh, God, why? Have you got
to check with your missus?

228
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,802
No, actually, I don't have
to check with my missus.

229
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,284
What are you doing?
I'm showing you the door.

230
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,482
Is it a door?
it doesn't have a lintel.

231
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,689
And it's glass. So is it a
window or is it a door?

232
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,890
Maybe it's a windoor.
You can have that.

233
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,291
Please leave, Gary.

234
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,408
All right. All right.

235
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,847
£600, wasn't it?

236
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,801
Oh, um, I thought you should know.
What?

237
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,091
Mum died.

238
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,208
When?
Couple of weeks ago.

239
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,323
The big cancer.

240
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,361
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,006
She just always really
liked you, you know.

242
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,441
Got me thinking
about the old days.

243
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,887
Particularly that night, you
know, because we were so happy.

244
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,611
And, you know, I love
the boys like brothers,

245
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,730
but when all's said and done,
you're the best friend I ever had.

246
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,687
It was good to
see you, mate.

247
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,966
Pete?

248
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,804
Steven. Thank God.

249
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,723
I had a horrible feeling I was
going to be the only one here.

250
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,451
I reckon that's not the last horrible
feeling you're gonna have today, mate.

251
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,646
This can't be happening.
Can it?

252
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,563
You said it. What the
hell are we doing here?

253
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,085
What we always did.

254
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,811
Follow Gary King into
almost certain oblivion.

255
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,086
Hello, Steven.

256
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,286
You all right, mate?

257
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,805
Pete. Hi, mate.

258
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,163
Didn't we decide to stop calling him
Fearless Leader somewhere around 1992?

259
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,446
Old habits die hard.

260
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,010
They'll be putting that
on Gary's tombstone.

261
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,764
No, they won't.
You know he'll outlive us all.

262
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,490
That'd be funny
if it wasn't true.

263
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,449
Hang on a sec.
What?

264
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,649
I'm just trying to decide which of
us is the biggest idiot for coming.

265
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,366
Maybe he had an accident.
Oh, sorry, Andy.

266
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,761
Sorry. No,no,no. It's fine.

267
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,046
I think Gary having
an accident

268
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,805
would actually be the best outcome
for all of us, including Gary.

269
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,605
Unbelievable.

270
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,521
Oh, yes.

271
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,524
Look at these cunts.

272
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,045
You're late.
No, I'm not.

273
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,646
Yeah, you are. You said 3:00.
It's almost 4:00.

274
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,131
Yeah, 3 for 4.

275
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,043
You know your problem, Gary?
You're never wrong.

276
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,167
How is that a problem?

277
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,083
I can't believe you bought
another Granada Mark ll.

278
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,161
What do you mean?

279
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,811
This looks exactly like
the car I sold you in 1989.

280
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,804
This is the car you sold me in 1989.
Best 300 quid I ever spent.

281
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,291
This is The Beast?
Yeah.

282
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,768
Pretty much. I mean, she's
had a bit of work done.

283
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,969
I had to replace the brakes,
suspension, exhaust, seats, wheels,

284
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,362
paneling, carburetor, manifold, the whole
engine, really, mirrors, headlamps.

285
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,920
Other than that,
she's the same old motor.

286
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,331
You could almost
say an antique.

287
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,644
Well, then let's get this
antique on the roadshow.

288
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,208
Come on, you bellends.
We're going to be late.

289
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,610
And we're back.
Just like the Five Musketeers.

290
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,325
Three Musketeers,
isn't it?

291
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,811
Four if you count
D'Artagnan.

292
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,803
Well, nobody knows how many there
were, really, do they, Pete?

293
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,120
I mean,
history's a sketchbook.

294
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,170
<i>You do know that The Three
Musketeers is a fiction, right?</i>

295
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,287
Written by Alexandre Dumas?

296
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,169
A lot of people are saying that
about the Bible these days.

297
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,203
What, that it was written by
Alexandre Dumas?

298
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,487
Don't be daft, Steve,
it was written by Jesus.

299
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,523
Oh. Anyway, five
sounds much better.

300
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,965
I think they missed a trick
only having three.

301
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,930
'Cause you'd have five, then two could've
died and they'd still have three left.

302
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,923
Are we there yet?
Let's do this!

303
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,964
Soup Dragons!
I remember this one.

304
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,645
I put this on a tape
for you, didn't I?

305
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,801
Yeah, this is it.

306
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,963
This is the tape?
Yeah, yeah! Look, look.

307
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,682
Where did you find it?
it was in the tape player.

308
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,326
Oh, look. Is anyone hungry?

309
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,728
I need a piss actually.

310
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,920
This is a long piss.

311
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,648
If it is a piss.

312
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,200
Might be a little...
Poo.

313
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,725
How is that a poo?

314
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,481
Still work for your old man, Pete?
Yeah. I'm a partner now.

315
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,561
You?

316
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,645
Yeah, started my own firm in '98.
Got bought out in '05.

317
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,484
I'm happier, though.
It's less stress.

318
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,045
Ollie?
Property.

319
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,602
I co-manage a boutique estate
agency in North London.

320
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,806
Very competitive.

321
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,764
Is it family law you're in, Andy?
Corporate.

322
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,046
Does anyone know
what Gary's doing?

323
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,929
He's playing Need For Speed.
Over there.

324
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,287
Come on, come on,
come on!

325
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,361
He hasn't changed, has he?

326
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,330
I don't know. He did finally
pay me back that £600.

327
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,604
Really? He borrowed £200 off me.
And me.

328
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,363
I can't believe it.
I can't believe you'd do that!

329
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,841
Oh! Of course I can.

330
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,849
It's just robbing
Peter to pay Paul.

331
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,602
No, I borrowed it from Peter to pay you.
I still owe Paul.

332
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,885
Oh, shit.

333
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,689
Newton Haven.

334
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,685
Take a moment to look upon it in its original
colors, boys, for tonight we paint it red.

335
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,328
Oh, no, no, no. Shit.

336
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,286
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

337
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,600
Fuck, fuck.

338
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,728
Oh, no, it's okay,
I did it all in the services.

339
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,490
Know why I pulled
you over, sir?

340
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,165
Was the music too loud?

341
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,727
Your left brake light is faulty.
Oh!

342
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,566
The old brake lights! So called
because they're always breaking.

343
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,005
I'll get that sorted out,
Officer.

344
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,286
Can I see your license, sir?
Yup.

345
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,601
Ah!

346
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,091
You know what?
It's in my wallet.

347
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,891
And I left that
at the bloody gym!

348
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,562
Any other form of identification?
No, it's all in my sports bag.

349
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,120
That's bloody typical,
isn't it? Um...

350
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,249
I'll give you my name and address, you
can run me through the old system.

351
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,367
Go on then.

352
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,408
It's Peter Page.

353
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,361
48 Bishop's Gardens,
London, N2 T12.

354
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,050
Jesus, Gary! WTF? Why did
you give him my name?

355
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,645
I'm not gonna give
him my name, am I?

356
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,006
Suppose I get done
by the police?

357
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,445
You won't get done
by the police.

358
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,449
Gary, he will check the number
plate against his name!

359
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,130
I know. Why do you think
I gave him Pete's name?

360
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,010
Jesus Christ, Gary, I own a car showroom.
lam a junior partner.

361
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,525
This is...

362
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,726
Just trust me.

363
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,971
So, Mr. Page, what brings
you to Newton Haven?

364
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,930
Well, we're all from here. We're
just back to see the sights.

365
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,923
Have a crack at
the old Golden Mile.

366
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,286
Might get a bit messy.

367
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,488
Well, you make sure you get
that brake light fixed

368
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,166
and you might want to do
an emissions test, too.

369
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,086
Oh, and, Peter.

370
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,400
Don't make too much mess.

371
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,726
We won't!

372
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,047
Hmm.

373
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,201
I don't understand.

374
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,169
It's simple, Pete.

375
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,164
The car's still registered to
you, it has been since 1989.

376
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,605
But I've moved
three times since then.

377
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,170
I know, I changed
the log book.

378
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,924
Where do you think
all those points came from?

379
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,246
Jesus. You guys need to relax.

380
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,729
Do you know how much
trouble you could get into?

381
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,370
Do you know how much
trouble I'm already in?

382
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,601
What's that
supposed to mean?

383
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,968
Hey. What the hell is this?
Why are we even here?

384
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,566
We are here to
get annihilated.

385
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,843
Have you got any plans
for dinner at all?

386
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,810
Tonight, we will be partaking
of a liquid repast

387
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,167
as we wend our way
up The Golden Mile.

388
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,925
Commencing with an inaugural
tankard at The First Post,

389
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,083
then onto The Old Familiar, The
Famous Cock, The Cross Hands,

390
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,571
The Good Companions,
The Trusty Servant,

391
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,802
The Two Headed Dog, The Mermaid,
The Beehive, The King's Head

392
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,848
and The Hole in the Wall
for a measure of the same.

393
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,720
All before the last bittersweet
pint in that most fateful terminus,

394
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,961
The World's End.

395
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,041
Leave a light on,
good lady,

396
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,441
for though we may return
with a twinkle in our eyes,

397
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,727
we will, in truth,
be blind drunk.

398
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,881
Come on!

399
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,769
Until 1840...
Fucking hell.

400
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,889
...this building was the site of
Newton Haven's first post office.

401
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,928
Until an enterprising
business fellow decided that

402
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,970
far from befitting the sending
and receiving of mail

403
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,168
it was perhaps better
suited <i>as</i> a humble taproom

404
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,006
where a weary traveler might get twatted.
Come on.

405
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,047
Ah!

406
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,770
It's like déja vu.

407
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,002
I don't remember this at all.
Has it been refurbished?

408
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,969
Been bought by a chain,
hasn't it?

409
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,644
Part of that nationwide
initiative to rob

410
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,644
small, charming pubs
of any discernible character.

411
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,206
Starbucking, man.
It's happening everywhere.

412
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,205
Can't take away
that smell, though.

413
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,884
I'm sure they tried.

414
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,806
Good evening, Raymondo.
The prodigal sons return. Eh?

415
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,405
Who's on the
guest list tonight?

416
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,369
Come again?
The guest ales.

417
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,205
We, sir, are doing The
Golden Mile and you have

418
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,442
the honor of drawing
first blood.

419
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,171
What do you recommend? There's one.
Crowning Glory.

420
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,725
Rather fitting.
How's that?

421
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,529
I'm Gary King.
What?

422
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,841
So tell me more.
About what?

423
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,161
Crowning Glory. Is it nutty?
Is it foamy? Is it hoppy?

424
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,766
Does it have a surprisingly fruity
note which lingers on the tongue?

425
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,241
Hmm. It's beer.
Hmm.

426
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,651
We'll have five
of those, please.

427
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,724
No. Sorry. Can we have four of
those and a tap water, please?

428
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,406
What?

429
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,328
I don't believe this,

430
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,088
a man of your legendary prowess
drinking fucking rain.

431
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,803
It's like seeing a lion
eating some hummus.

432
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,962
That doesn't make any sense. I
know it doesn't make any sense.

433
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,611
You seriously have a problem with me
not drinking, after what happened?

434
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,251
I don't, but King Arthur does!
Oh, this'll be good.

435
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,845
What's King Arthur
got to do with it?

436
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,242
Do you honestly think that King Arthur
came back from the Battle of Hastings,

437
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,722
fucking rocked up at Arthur's Castle...
Camelot.

438
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,006
...walked up to the bar
and went,

439
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,923
"Hello.
Could I have a tap water?"

440
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,526
No, because they didn't have
running water in Arthurian times.

441
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,447
Exactly. He would have had a mead.
The King Arthur of beers.

442
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,682
And I'm less of a man because
I choose to drink water?

443
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,285
Well, it's a bit
"ooh ducky", innit?

444
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,691
That's not very PC, Gary.

445
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,569
Get out of the '90s, Pete.

446
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,564
There's nothing "ooh ducky"
about being teetotal,

447
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,120
about walking into a pub
after a rugby match

448
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,569
and ordering a tap water at a bar packed
full of big ugly bastards wearing warpaint.

449
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,803
That, my friend, takes confidence, yeah?
I'm talking balls.

450
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,564
You said it, poof.

451
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,250
I don't know if you're aware of this,
Gary, but we are not teenagers anymore.

452
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,806
And God forbid you ever
have children, because if...

453
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,961
I might have kids.

454
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,565
Then you had better be ready
to take responsibility...

455
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,244
No. I mean I might have kids.

456
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,804
You remember Karen
Eggerton, who I fucked?

457
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,726
She was two weeks late when her
parents emigrated to Normandy.

458
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,566
I never heard from her again.
She might have had a baby.

459
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,240
Imagine that? A French kid.

460
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,004
It's pointless arguing
with you.

461
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,481
To kids.
Wherever they may be.

462
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,401
Kids.
Kids.

463
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,964
Drink up. Let's Boo-Boo.

464
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,561
"Boo-Boo".
What is that?

465
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,881
You remember,
"Let's Boo-Boo."

466
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,008
You know, from Mr. Shepherd's
classroom, it said on the wall,

467
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,606
"Exit, pursued by a bear," you
know, from that Shakespeare play?

468
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,444
<i>A</i> Winter's Tale.
Yeah. What was it called?

469
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,760
<i>A Winter's Tale.
That's it.</i>

470
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,889
And if we needed to make a quick getaway,
we'd say, "Exit, pursued by a bear,"

471
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,962
and then it was,
"Exit, pursued by Yogi Bear,"

472
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,804
and then it was just,
"Let's Yogi and Boo-Boo,"

473
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,166
and then, "Let's Boo-Boo."

474
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,487
So you're saying we should go?
Yeah. It's shit here, innit?

475
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,601
Ah!

476
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,605
The Old Familiar.
Now this is a pub.

477
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,851
Yes.
This is more like it.

478
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,081
Like déja vu.

479
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:48,529
David, my man, have you heard the news?
Gary King is back in town.

480
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,647
Who's he?

481
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,685
How was the
funeral, Gary?

482
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,321
Your mum's funeral?

483
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,482
It's difficult to
put into words.

484
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,285
But if I had to choose
three, I would say,

485
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,690
"Really, really sad."

486
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,404
Oh, no, that's two,
isn't it?

487
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,285
How about,
"Really, very sad"?

488
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,523
It's a shame,
she was a good woman.

489
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,970
I really liked your mum.

490
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,964
Me, too, mate. Me, too.

491
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,643
Hello.
Hello, mate.

492
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,767
Are you here?

493
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,842
Yeah, I've been here for ages.
What are you talking about?

494
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,843
You get lost on the
ring road again?

495
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,410
This is Newton Haven.

496
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,329
What time are you meeting The Twins?
Twins?

497
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,046
We're all at The Old Familiar.
Come by if you want.

498
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,646
Yeah, he is. Okay.
See you soon.

499
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,201
Who was that, O-Man?

500
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,769
Don't call me O-Man, Gary.
If you must know it was Sam.

501
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,807
Sam's here?
Sam's here?

502
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,804
Is there a fucking echo in here?
Yes, Sam's here.

503
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,121
She's down from Manchester. We're
driving to Mum's tomorrow.

504
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,326
What, and she's coming here?

505
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,807
Calm down, Steve, I saw her first.
Jesus Christ, not this again.

506
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,646
Are you fucking kidding me?
I saw her first.

507
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,121
You really have a selective
memory, don't you?

508
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,685
Somebody else
was saying that.

509
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,484
Me. No. I would have remembered.

510
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,449
I told you I had
a thing about Sam

511
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,000
and you proceeded to try and get
in her pants at every opportunity.

512
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,081
Guys, please.

513
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,401
You only liked her after
you found out I liked her!

514
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,244
That's right, because you
did the school play.

515
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,328
<i>Cabaret. Cabaret.
Because she was in it.</i>

516
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,244
And she wore those fishnet stockings
and you got a big boner on stage.

517
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,401
Jesus Christ.

518
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,529
Doesn't matter anyway, she always had
a massive wide on for Adrian Keane.

519
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,761
I hated that prick.

520
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,448
Can we not talk about
my sister in relation to,

521
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,689
A, massive wide ons,
B, Steven's erect penis?

522
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,205
All right.

523
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,248
Is she still fit, though?
I'm not answering that.

524
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,001
Is she, though?

525
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,606
Am I what?
Fit.

526
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,727
Hello, Sam. Steven? You've
grown, haven't you?

527
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,768
Yeah, sideways.
You look fantastic.

528
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,251
Steroids.

529
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,085
Andy, long time.

530
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,725
Hi, Pete.
Hi, Sam.

531
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,841
All right, big brother?

532
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,447
Gary.

533
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,888
<i>Willkommen. Bienvenue.
Welcome.</i>

534
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,121
Sam. Would you like a drink?

535
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,011
Hey, Steve. She's just got here.
Come on.

536
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,161
Sam. Would you like a drink?

537
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,408
I'll have a vodka tonic,
thanks, Steven. Sure.

538
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,010
I'm just going to nip to the loo.
Cool.

539
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,130
Nature calls.

540
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,764
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

541
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,842
I'm going to the toilet.
Well, then, so am I.

542
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,450
Gary! You are
out of your mind!

543
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,965
What are you talking about?
You gave me the sign.

544
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,805
What sign?
You went to the toilet.

545
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,763
Gary, are you serious? I
haven't seen you in 20 years.

546
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,366
Do you really think I'm going to have
sex with you in the ladies' toilet?

547
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,090
Well, the disableds
is out of order.

548
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,128
Gary. What happened?
I don't know,

549
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,407
maybe one of them put too many
paper towels down the toilet.

550
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,642
I mean, we don't know what they
are thinking, really, do we?

551
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,928
No. What happened to you?

552
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,161
Nothing.

553
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,049
Nothing happened to me.
I'm the same old Gary.

554
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,169
No shit.
Huh!

555
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,561
So, do you wanna?

556
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,881
Oliver. I'll see you later.
You're going?

557
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,088
I thought you weren't meeting The
Twins for another half hour?

558
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,050
I'm not. Oh, yeah.
I believe this is yours.

559
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,724
"Out of order."
It's a private joke.

560
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,890
I don't want to know.

561
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,763
- What is that?
- Modern art.

562
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,887
It's a memorial,
isn't it?

563
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,291
Yeah. To modern art.

564
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,685
Hey, guys, do you
know what time it is?

565
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,526
It's not even 6:00.

566
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,491
Wrong! It's high time
we got onto The Cock!

567
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,607
Whoo-hoo!

568
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,321
Let's go.

569
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,924
Come on.

570
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,730
When you're ready, mate.

571
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,048
Oh, shit.
Look who it is.

572
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,244
Basil. Mad Basil!

573
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,721
Do you remember?
We used to come in here

574
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,522
and listen to him talk about fucking UFOs
and lizard people and underwater Nazis.

575
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,483
Didn't he spout some
bullshit about the Bermuda Triangle

576
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,601
actually being a square?

577
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,809
No, he said it was two isosceles
triangles forming a rhombus.

578
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,086
He was your best mate,
wasn't he, Steve?

579
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,640
No, he wasn't my
best mate, Gary.

580
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,848
He was a lonely, old guy and
I felt a bit sorry for him.

581
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,763
That's right. Basil!

582
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,008
Maybe we're not the local
legends you think we are.

583
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,684
Gary King?
Speak for yourself, mate.

584
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,171
You're barred.

585
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,522
I cannot fucking believe this.
This is ridiculous.

586
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,681
Believe me, Gary,
it's not worth it.

587
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,445
Have two in the next one. Have them
all in the next one, for all I care.

588
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,325
We've got to have one in every pub
otherwise the whole thing's fucked.

589
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,283
I'd say it was fairly
fucked already, mate.

590
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,561
Great.

591
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,488
How much more of this
do we have to endure?

592
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,562
That was three. There's nine more.
Oh, good.

593
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,529
Fuck that
I need to eat something.

594
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,886
We can get some food
in the next pub.

595
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,928
As long as it's
reasonably healthy.

596
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,490
This is Newton Haven.

597
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,569
Hardly the heart of the
organic revolution.

598
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,290
I doubt it's the
heart of anything.

599
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,160
My wife wanted us to go organic,
problem is, I kinda like eating shit.

600
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,163
The next pub does shit!
Keep up!

601
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,644
Oh, yeah.
I remember this one.

602
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,927
- We had New Year's in here, didn't we?
- '89 into '90.

603
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,929
Isn't that when you
slept on the pool table, Andy?

604
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,121
Yeah. I believe it was.

605
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,611
For six hours.
Six hours.

606
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,245
Thank you for reminding me.

607
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,287
Do you remember
when you woke up,

608
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,647
we said you'd been asleep for
a year and that it was 1991

609
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,085
and you freaked out
and punched a clock?

610
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,566
That was a great night.

611
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,643
Didn't you manage to get off
with Erika Leekes, Peter?

612
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,605
Yes, I did. Something of a personal
triumph, if I say so myself.

613
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,530
She of the Marmalade Sandwich fame?
Marmalade Sandwich...

614
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,641
The very same.

615
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,570
Erika Leekes, Tracy Benson,
Becky Salt.

616
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,483
Two blondes and a redhead
in the middle.

617
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,530
The Marmalade Sandwich.
Becky Salt. Fucking hell.

618
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,681
Wonder what
they're doing now.

619
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,966
Why don't you ask them?

620
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,087
What do you mean?

621
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,687
I mean, sitting at that table over there are
two blondes and a redhead in the middle.

622
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,046
Shut the fuck up.

623
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,361
I'd say that's Erika Leekes on the
left, Tracy Benson on the right,

624
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,442
and by process of elimination,
there's Becky Salt in the middle.

625
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,363
That's the Marmalade Sandwich
all growed up.

626
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,124
That is very spooky.

627
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,804
We should get them over.
No.

628
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,370
Leave the past where it is.

629
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,010
It's bad enough having to
look at your old, ugly mugs.

630
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,481
You make it sound like
we're fucking ancient.

631
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,527
We haven't changed that much.

632
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,762
I mean, sure, Steve's let
himself go a bit. What?

633
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,525
Pete's got the same haircut and Oliver
has still got his mark of the devil.

634
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,806
No, he hasn't.
No, he hasn't.

635
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,041
It's called
laser surgery, Gary.

636
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,600
It's a small price to pay for
not being called fucking O-Man.

637
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,284
That works for Sisters Of
Mercy tattoos as well.

638
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,771
I still like the
Sisters Of Mercy.

639
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,166
Well, good job,
or you'd never go swimming.

640
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,486
I'm lost.
Don't be.

641
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,291
Well, I for one, think it's nice
to see the old faces again.

642
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,447
Cheers, mate.

643
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,085
Excuse me? This taken?

644
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,480
Is this seat taken?

645
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,241
Have it, mate.

646
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,687
Thanks.

647
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,131
Wasn't that...
Shane Hawkins.

648
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,964
Hey, didn't he...
Yes, he did.

649
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,202
Hang on. What happened
with Shane Hawkins again?

650
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,681
I'd rather not bring it all
up again, if that's okay.

651
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,364
Hey, man. Listen, Pete.

652
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,124
Bottling up past trauma
can lead to

653
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,443
inadequate coping strategies
in later life, apparently.

654
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,887
I don't know, I mean, it's not
even about the past, you know.

655
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,089
It's not about the fact
that he bullied me,

656
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,606
that he made me miss more
school days than chicken pox.

657
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,242
It's not even that he forced me to spend
entire lessons hiding in a toilet cubicle,

658
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,609
or that he punched me so hard
he dislodged my eyeball.

659
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,730
And it's not even that he ruined
a large portion of my childhood.

660
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,124
No, it's the fact that just
then, he didn't recognize me.

661
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,365
He looked straight through me
like it all meant nothing.

662
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,521
That probably sounds weird,
doesn't it?

663
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,045
Shots!

664
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,283
S-H-O-T-S. Shots.

665
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,640
What are you doing, Gary?

666
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,842
I thought it was obvious.
Shots.

667
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,485
Firstly, Peter was talking
about something

668
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,925
which clearly made him
feel very uncomfortable.

669
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,162
It's all right, Andy.
No, Peter, it's not all right.

670
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,202
Secondly, 12 pints is more than enough,
and thirdly, I don't fucking drink!

671
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,328
But shots don't count,
do they?

672
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,084
You said you wanted
to catch up and chew the fat.

673
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,003
I think you just
wanted to drink it.

674
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,486
We're not here
as your friends.

675
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,244
We're just your
fucking enablers.

676
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,847
Enablers. That's a funny word, isn't it?
"Enabler."

677
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,570
Gary King And The Enablers.

678
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,210
That's a good name for a band, Steve.
Write that down.

679
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,560
Don't do a Gary, Gary.

680
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,603
Oh, is that a thing now, is it?
It's always been a thing.

681
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,330
You don't need us to
help you get fucked up,

682
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,210
you've done a perfectly
good job so far on your own.

683
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,243
I'm gonna go and see if
there's a bus back to London

684
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,560
if anyone wants to
come with me.

685
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,440
You can't go. This is special.
This is our anniversary.

686
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,851
It's not the
anniversary, Gary.

687
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,490
We did this in June.
It's October.

688
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,289
Yeah, but it's the anniversary
of the year, isn't it?

689
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,203
Every year is the
anniversary of a year!

690
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,009
It's just not the
same anymore, Gary,

691
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,521
and it's not that the town's
changed, we have changed.

692
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,405
Yeah, well, you can't go,
'cause the buses are finished.

693
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,361
Then I'm gonna go back to the B&B.
You coming?

694
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,521
I could do with
an early one actually.

695
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,681
I should probably go
and find Sam.

696
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,650
Yeah, I'm gonna go
and find Sam with Oliver.

697
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,086
That's settled then, yeah?

698
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,211
You know what I think?
I think you're jealous.

699
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,361
Yeah, you've got your houses and your cars
and your wives and your job security.

700
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,649
But you don't have
what I have. Freedom.

701
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,050
You're all slaves and I'm free
to do what I want any old time.

702
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,971
And this is what you want?

703
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,565
You should grow up, mate.
Join society.

704
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,081
Yeah, but Mum died.

705
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,602
And we're all very sorry,
but now it's time to go home.

706
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,603
I thought we were home.

707
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,524
I can't help feeling sorry for him.

708
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,291
Don't.

709
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,807
Oh! Fuck! Piss!

710
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,244
Careful, the floor's
a bit pissy.

711
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,890
Wasn't me.

712
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,289
That was me.

713
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,169
Did that back in '90.

714
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,290
1990.

715
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,883
Punched the shit
out of the wall.

716
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,567
I don't know why. Seemed
important at the time.

717
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,048
You guys look like you're
having a good night, though.

718
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,090
I'm doing The Golden Mile tonight.
You want to tag along?

719
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,970
We'll be like The Six Musketeers.

720
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,485
I said we're doing
The Golden Mile.

721
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,603
You think you're so cool,
don't you?

722
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,321
Huh?

723
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,410
But we were cooler.

724
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,130
We owned this town.

725
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,771
We paved the way for you lot.
Blazed a trail.

726
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,968
Hey! Look at me when
I'm talking to you!

727
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,122
Please don't.
Don't what?

728
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,851
You don't want
to do that.

729
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,570
Don't I?

730
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,684
What?

731
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,563
You need to explain
this right now!

732
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,801
Andy, this kid
just attacked me.

733
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,881
Don't you dare
change the subject!

734
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,007
He smashed my head
in the mirror.

735
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,560
You know who I just spoke to?
Your mum!

736
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,211
And not from the afterlife.
From fucking Bournemouth.

737
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,327
Is that real?

738
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,845
She says she hasn't spoken
to you for eight months.

739
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,445
Andy...
His head just came off!

740
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,961
No, Gary, you are not gonna
wriggle out of it this time.

741
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,601
WTF!

742
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,209
There's someone in here.

743
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,006
Andy, did you see...

744
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,927
WTF, Gary. WTF.

745
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,083
What the fuck
does "WTF" mean?

746
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,721
What the fuck?
Oh, yeah.

747
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,169
This can't be happening.
Can it?

748
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,366
You said it, mate.

749
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,130
I can't believe it.

750
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,326
I know, mate.

751
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,323
I can't believe you
lied about your mum!

752
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,481
That was a white lie!

753
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,040
How is that a white lie?
She's not dead, is she?

754
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,246
Wait, wait, wait!
Where are you going?

755
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,209
To get help.
No, don't do that!

756
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,561
What, don't get help? We don't
know how far this goes.

757
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,041
Wait, who are you calling?
Vanessa.

758
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,167
Who's Vanessa?
My wife.

759
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,004
Why are you calling your wife?
Because she's my wife.

760
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,605
You just said we don't
know how far this goes.

761
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,206
I was just thinking about the pub.
Oh, well, there's a surprise.

762
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,606
I can't get through.

763
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,846
Can you get through to Sam?

764
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,524
I've got full bars and
I'm not getting through.

765
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:56,369
<i>I'm sorry, your call
cannot be connected at this time.</i>

766
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,851
Must be the network.

767
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,289
Holy shit.
This is all connected.

768
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,841
This explains why
everything's gone fuck up.

769
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,246
Everybody's been replaced
by one of these.

770
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,688
That's why no one recognized
us, Basil, Dave, Raymondo.

771
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,331
I thought it was weird.
Shane Hawkins.

772
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,291
Exactly. It's not us that's
changed, it's the town.

773
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,408
I'm right, aren't I, Andy?

774
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,767
Andy, aren't I right?
You're never wrong.

775
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,367
No, whatever the fuck's happening,
we can't stay in the gents forever.

776
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,323
Ten people have entered this
toilet in the last five minutes

777
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,044
and not a single one
has come back out again.

778
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,531
That's going to
look suspicious.

779
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,051
Gay loving.

780
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,163
And that's worse
than five dismembered bodies?

781
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,721
This is Newton Haven.

782
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,481
How's it looking?
Normal. Very normal.

783
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,649
I don't like it.

784
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,242
What do we do?
Let's finish our drinks.

785
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,522
I say we neck these and
get the fuck out of here.

786
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,931
To London?
To The Trusty Servant.

787
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,162
Are you fucking kidding?
Oh, yeah.

788
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,440
It's The Good Companions next.
I always mix those two up.

789
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,284
Are you saying we move
on to the next pub?

790
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,408
We should get in The Beast
and head back to London!

791
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,887
My brake light is broken.
So don't use the brakes!

792
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,002
I'm way over the limit. When
has that ever stopped you?

793
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,845
I don't want to put any more
points on Pete's license.

794
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,440
Andy can drive,
he's teetotal!

795
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,006
Ah!

796
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,411
That's settles it then.

797
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,608
The last thing we need to do is
get pulled over by the police.

798
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,920
A, we're all drunk,

799
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,765
B, they might be in on it and,
C, we've got blood on our hands.

800
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,962
It's more like ink. We've
got ink on our hands.

801
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,766
So, has it got messy yet? What?

802
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,810
What are you, five pubs in? Four

803
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,687
Oh, not even halfway.
Plenty more fun to be had.

804
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,371
Enjoy your night, Peter.

805
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,561
Thank you.

806
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,566
Thank you.

807
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,007
Sorry.

808
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,242
The way I see it, we've told everybody
we were doing The Golden Mile.

809
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,321
You did.

810
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,084
If we suddenly jump in The Beast
now and head for the hills,

811
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,400
they're gonna know
that we know,

812
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,642
but if we keep doing what we're
doing and going where we're going,

813
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,721
then they're not gonna know.

814
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,926
Know what?
That we know.

815
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,526
I suggest we finish what we started
and leave quietly in the morning.

816
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,883
Wait. You're really suggesting...
We finish The Golden Mile.

817
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,522
It's pointless
arguing with him.

818
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,245
Drink up. Let's Boo-Boo.

819
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,284
<i>We're just five friends</i>

820
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,248
<i>on a night out,
having a good time.</i>

821
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,685
Drinking.
Ah!

822
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,091
Been
Pubs

823
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,446
Shall we?

824
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,927
I feel a little
uncomfortable drinking this much.

825
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,968
It's like Dutch
courage, isn't it?

826
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,725
You know, when the English soldiers
used to drink Dutch gin before battle

827
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,131
to give them super strength.

828
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,646
You know, I thought that was to
numb the sense of impending doom.

829
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,767
Exactly.

830
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,889
We're just five friends on a
night out, having a good time.

831
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,005
I need the toilet.

832
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,845
Go on then. You've earned it.
Huh?

833
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,127
You're doing really good, Oliver.

834
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,926
He didn't make it this far last time.
I'm proud of him.

835
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,930
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

836
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,526
Yeah, five guys on a night
out, having a great time.

837
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,090
Pretending to have
a great time.

838
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,321
Are you pretending?

839
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,051
If we get out of here alive,
I'm going to kill you.

840
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,724
We're still
in the dark, Gary.

841
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,406
Yeah, our families could be
in danger for all we know.

842
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,406
I know, my mum could be dead.
For reals this time.

843
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,528
Hey, why don't we just
ask somebody? Who?

844
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,809
The Reverend Green.
Come on. Wait.

845
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,645
What the fuck
are you doing?

846
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,690
I'm going to go and have a little
chat with The Reverend Green.

847
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,441
You're going to buy drugs?

848
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,922
I am going to go over there and subtly
check if that is The Reverend Green

849
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,970
and if it is, I can ask him
what's going on,

850
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,565
and possibly buy some drugs.

851
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,444
But what if he's one of them?

852
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,648
No, me and The Reverend had
a highly sophisticated code

853
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,449
when discussing the purchase
of herbal narcotics.

854
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:41,084
If he doesn't understand me, it means he's
one of them and I will simply walk away.

855
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,441
Ah!

856
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,365
Have you got any drugs? I
don't do that anymore, Gary.

857
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,363
Do what?
That.

858
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,726
That why you're
in a suit, is it?

859
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,564
'Cause drug dealing is
not good enough for you?

860
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,722
There are no drug
dealers anymore, Gary.

861
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,643
I've got a proper job
in a proper office.

862
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,246
You had a proper office.
That was the gents' toilets.

863
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,209
Nothing wrong with doing
your business in the toilet.

864
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,131
Look, a lot has changed since
you have left. I know.

865
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,328
How much do you know?
A little.

866
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,680
How much is a little?

867
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,729
The town has been taken over
by robots full of blue stuff.

868
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,881
Shh. Keep your voice down.

869
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,246
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

870
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,721
Tell us then.
Well, they're not robots.

871
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,643
Do you even know
what robot means?

872
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,486
Course I do. It's like,
"Hello, lam a robot."

873
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,201
It means "slave" and believe
me, they are not slaves.

874
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,408
Are you their prisoner?
No, lam very happy.

875
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,641
Tell your face.

876
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,922
Hey! What's going on?

877
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,923
The town's been invaded
by robots who aren't robots

878
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,923
and The Rev's their prisoner.
I am not.

879
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,841
We're leaving first thing.
We can get you out of here.

880
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,890
I'm not going. It's not what you think.
This is for all our benefit.

881
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,482
You've said too much, Trevor.
Yeah, put a cork in it, Trevor.

882
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,767
I'm just trying to help.
It's not your place to help.

883
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,410
They will have
everything in hand.

884
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,527
Are you guys robots?

885
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,048
Well, the word robot actually
comes from an old Czech word...

886
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,645
...robotnik...
...meaning slave.

887
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,649
And we are not slaves.
We are very, very happy.

888
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,926
And not robots.

889
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,451
Oh, my God,
are these guys robots?

890
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,646
Shut up about robots!

891
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,290
I say we shut up
about everything!

892
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,361
Trevor.

893
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,126
It's your supervisor.

894
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,966
<i>Hello,</i> Trevor.
Hello, sir.

895
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,770
But...

896
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,045
I understand.

897
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,371
Thanks a bunch.

898
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,051
What did I miss?

899
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,083
Your friends
trying to help.

900
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,446
We don't need
your help.

901
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,891
Well, what should we do?

902
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,609
I suggest you get
on your way.

903
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,249
I think we should
do what he says.

904
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,411
Okay.

905
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,326
Here we go.

906
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,724
Come on!
Gary.

907
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,131
Gary!

908
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,282
Let's just get in and
out of this one, yeah?

909
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,124
No more making new friends.

910
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,049
Gentlemen!
The prodigal sons return!

911
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,090
What will it be, one of
our guest ales perchance?

912
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,771
Might I recommend
five pints of Crowning Glory?

913
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,850
Rather fitting, wouldn't you say, Gary?
What? Sorry. What?

914
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,969
It's a delightful brew.
Hoppy, nutty, foamy.

915
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,203
Does it have a surprisingly fruity
note that lingers on the tongue?

916
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,926
You're obviously a connoisseur.

917
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,929
Then you'll already
know that it's a rare treat

918
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,925
for rogues, reverends, royalty
and all good folks between.

919
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,570
Five of those, please.

920
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,563
Welcome home, boys.

921
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,724
I don't remember him
being that friendly.

922
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,167
He's obviously
one of them.

923
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,845
How can he be?
He remembered me.

924
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,285
We don't know
what they remember.

925
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,805
Maybe they
have selective memories.

926
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,803
Yeah, like what's his name?
Me.

927
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,723
Maybe he's one of the others.
Like The Reverend.

928
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,165
It is very hard
to tell, isn't it?

929
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,169
Yeah, I mean, is he one of
them or is he one of them?

930
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,004
Wait, wait, which ones
are the thems again?

931
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,366
Well, they're both thems,
aren't they?

932
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,641
But there's two ways
of saying it.

933
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,768
Is he one of them or
is he one of them?

934
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,080
We need different terms.

935
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,131
One for the people who aren't robots and
one for the robots who aren't robots.

936
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:44,406
All right, we need to be able to
differentiate between them, them and us.

937
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,369
Yeah, I think the pronouns
are really confusing.

938
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,363
Yes. I don't even
know what a pronoun is.

939
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,442
It's a word that can
function by itself as a noun

940
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,090
which refers to something
else in the discourse.

941
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,525
I don't get it.
You just used one.

942
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,926
Did I?
Yeah. "it" is a pronoun.

943
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,967
What is?
It.

944
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,041
Is it?
Christ.

945
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,930
Look, we just need a fucking word
so we can identify who's who.

946
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,767
He's a blank, she's a blank, those
two people are definitely blanks.

947
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,681
Sam.

948
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,285
I got this, Steve.

949
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,925
All right, Sam?
Oh, crumbs.

950
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,089
How's your night going?

951
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,527
Good. Sort of.

952
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,242
What do you mean
"sort of"?

953
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,961
Well, it's weird, isn't it?

954
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:30,165
You come back and everything's
the same, but sort of different.

955
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,850
Different how?

956
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,530
Just weird.

957
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,085
How weird?

958
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,961
What are you getting at, Gary?

959
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,570
Come with me.

960
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,804
Fuck's sake, Gary,
take a hint.

961
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,211
It's all right, I'm not
trying to have sex with you.

962
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,691
Why are we in the
disabled toilets then?

963
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,966
There's something I need
to tell you right now,

964
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,246
unless you do
want to have sex,

965
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,367
in which case
I'll tell you afterwards.

966
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,441
Tell me right now.

967
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,846
Have you noticed anything
creepy about The Twins

968
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,001
apart from the fact
that they're twins?

969
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,447
Just because they're twins doesn't
automatically make them creepy.

970
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,170
It does a little bit.
You had sex with them.

971
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,608
A, I did not, and, B, how
did you know about that?

972
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,525
A, it's a small town, B, I'm not
stupid and, C, they told me.

973
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,364
Right. Well, I did once,
but I was wasted,

974
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,283
which was creepy because it was
like there was four of them.

975
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,930
I am not proud of it.
I am a bit.

976
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,486
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
No, this is...

977
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,001
Are you okay, Sam?
Are you okay, Sam?

978
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,610
I need a cigarette.

979
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,046
Nobots?
How about Fauxbots?

980
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,088
I think we should get away
from the whole robots thing.

981
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,286
Steven?

982
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,926
What's he up to?

983
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,405
Oh, don't worry, he's probably just
trying to fuck Oliver's sister.

984
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,481
Andy.

985
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,964
Oh, my God,
that man is full of shit.

986
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,764
I know that's not
a surprise to you.

987
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,808
What did he say, Sam?
What did he say, Sam?

988
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,291
He said that Newton Haven has been taken
over by robots full of blue stuff

989
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,920
and if we don't do what they say,
they will make us their prisoners.

990
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,650
Did you believe him?
Did you believe him?

991
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,167
No, of course not.

992
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,163
Did you believe him?
Did you believe him?

993
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,365
What?

994
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,802
See?
Come on, Sam.

995
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,848
You know better than
to believe Gary King.

996
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,521
Oh, crumbs.

997
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,041
Sam!

998
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,411
God!
You creepy bitches, get off!

999
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,161
Chuck us a ciggie.

1000
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,521
Oh.

1001
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,729
Gary, what's happening?

1002
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,406
I told you in the disableds.
Oh, yes, you did.

1003
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,880
We should get inside, eh?

1004
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,811
Otherwise people are going to
ask what the hell's going on.

1005
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,126
What the hell's going on?

1006
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,531
Steve, I got this.
Got what?

1007
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,841
Sam, he's not good
enough for you.

1008
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,921
What?
What?

1009
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,651
We've been through
some crazy shit tonight

1010
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,644
and it's really put things
in perspective for me,

1011
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:18,123
and if everything is as fucked up as it seems,
then there's something I need to tell you.

1012
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,086
You might think this is because
I've had seven pints, but it's not.

1013
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,161
It's not.

1014
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,530
I'm in love with you, Sam.

1015
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,405
I always have been,

1016
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,930
and it breaks my heart to see you waste
your affections on Gary fucking King.

1017
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,651
Hey, that's a bit harsh. Oh,
no, you've got it all wrong.

1018
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,842
There's nothing between...
And while I'm being honest,

1019
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,766
just to lay it all out there, lam
currently seeing a fitness instructor.

1020
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,251
She's 26 years old,

1021
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,085
but I would drop her in
a heartbeat if it meant

1022
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,810
that I had one last chance
with you.

1023
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,209
Steven, there's nothing
between me and Gary King.

1024
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:54,921
Oh, fuck.

1025
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,970
Sorry.

1026
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,568
Hey! Get your feet off her!

1027
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,760
Pop its head off! Pop its head
off like an aspirin bottle.

1028
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,881
Blue-bloods?

1029
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,162
Nothing suggested in
the last three minutes

1030
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,844
has been better than
Smashy-Smashy Egg Men.

1031
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,604
Nothing.
What the hell's going on?

1032
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,921
Did you guys think of a name for
the robots who aren't robots?

1033
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,367
I'm afraid we've
drawn a blank.

1034
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,171
Well, we just had a barney with
two blanks in the beer garden.

1035
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,924
- We have to leave now!
- Agreed.

1036
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,280
Let's hit The Mermaid.

1037
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,044
Wait, what?
Number eight.

1038
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,087
"Number eight"?

1039
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,447
Oh, fuck.
Andy, what's happening?

1040
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,242
Gary thinks we should keep on with the
crawl because they know what we're doing,

1041
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,408
but they don't know that we
know what they're doing.

1042
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,768
And basically no one else
has a better idea, so fuck it.

1043
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,606
What?

1044
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,761
Wait!

1045
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,441
Guys! Guys!
I've got a better idea.

1046
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,488
I'm parked right round
here somewhere.

1047
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,086
Haul it. Just go!
Steven, tell them!

1048
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,322
Gary said they'll get us
if we try and leave now.

1049
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,051
We're way past leaving now.
Come on.

1050
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,290
Oh, yeah.

1051
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,883
This is what the kids want.

1052
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,325
This is a bit mad, isn't it?

1053
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,244
This is perfect. We can hide out in here.
I'll get the drinks in.

1054
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,805
Good plan, O-Man.
Hey!

1055
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,450
Keep an eye out
for blanks.

1056
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,721
You've got it.

1057
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,044
Why didn't you say anything?
About what?

1058
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,963
About what you said
in the garden.

1059
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,566
I always wanted to.

1060
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,563
It just never seemed
like the right moment.

1061
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,529
Something always
got in the way.

1062
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,648
Here you go,
get these down you.

1063
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,241
Thanks.

1064
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,607
Steven?

1065
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,363
Please! I have so
much to live for!

1066
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,442
It's me, you numpty.
Basil!

1067
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,364
I knew seeing your faces again
would spell trouble.

1068
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,841
Wait. How do I know
it's really you?

1069
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,762
Because I'm the only one who's going to
tell you the truth about Newton Haven.

1070
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,810
Now, do you recall the events of the
evening of June the 22nd, 1990?

1071
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,882
No, but I know a man who does.

1072
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,969
Here you go.
Hey.

1073
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,008
See anyone we know?

1074
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,882
The Marmalade Sandwich.
The Marmalade Sandwich.

1075
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,601
They look good.

1076
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,721
It's the lights.
It's the drink.

1077
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,290
Who cares what it is?

1078
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,241
Steven?

1079
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,641
Steven?

1080
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,245
That was the night
they arrived.

1081
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,482
Remember the shooting star?
That was them.

1082
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,891
Nothing happened at first.

1083
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,686
They were getting ready, burrowing
in underground, preparing.

1084
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,809
<i>Not long after you lot left,
people started to change.</i>

1085
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,803
<i>Just one or two at first,
then more.</i>

1086
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:56,322
They replaced people of influence,
taking over the institutions,

1087
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,809
<i>remaking, remodeling,
refurbishing.</i>

1088
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,843
Doing everything they could
to make us join them.

1089
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,491
I can't find Steven.
Where are the others?

1090
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,526
They're blending in.

1091
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,045
Oh, crumbs.

1092
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,284
It's not like the replacements
were evil, far from it.

1093
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:27,001
People got a lot friendlier.
That's how they do it.

1094
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,485
<i>It's not an invasion,
it's a merger.</i>

1095
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,530
<i>They don't want to get rid of
us, not if they can help it.</i>

1096
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,531
<i>They just want to make
us more like them.</i>

1097
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,449
<i>Change the way we think.</i>

1098
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,648
<i>Bring us into line
with all the others.</i>

1099
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,722
<i>Become another
link in their chain.</i>

1100
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,561
<i>Which is fine,
unless you say no.</i>

1101
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,324
That's when you get replaced.

1102
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,641
Once they get your DNA,
they've got you.

1103
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,801
How do they do that?

1104
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,120
<i>Any way they like.</i>

1105
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:59,082
<i>Blood tests, the nit nurse, sweat,
kissing, saliva on the rim of a glass.</i>

1106
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,286
Why do you think
I drink with this crazy straw?

1107
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,725
Not so crazy now, is it?

1108
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,970
If you're not on their side,
they'll create a version that is.

1109
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,291
<i>They can bring you back exactly the
same or even make you young again.</i>

1110
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,649
<i>It looks like you, it
even has your memories,</i>

1111
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,166
<i>but really it's just a vessel
to spread their message.</i>

1112
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,529
<i>Trust, love, respect, desire.</i>

1113
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,365
<i>Replaced in the name
of progress.</i>

1114
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,001
So, what happens to the
people who get replaced?

1115
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,090
The empties? Don't ask
me what happens to them.

1116
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,486
Why, what happens
to the empties?

1117
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,164
I told you not
to ask me that!

1118
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,527
Go! Get out,
before it's too late!

1119
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,642
Basil?
I said go!

1120
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,125
This just can't be good.

1121
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,364
Sam, who was the boy that you
liked in sixth form? Adrian?

1122
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,640
Adrian Keane. Why?

1123
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,486
He's over there.

1124
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,171
Hey, Sam.
How's life?

1125
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,568
Sam, we have to get out of here!
We have to get out of here!

1126
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,802
Where are the others?
They're blending in.

1127
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,250
Oh, fuck!

1128
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,483
Gary! No, just one more song.

1129
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,803
Gary, she's a blank!

1130
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,245
Don't be so judgmental.

1131
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,321
Oh, for fuck...

1132
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,681
Oh, yeah.
Come on.

1133
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,291
Still got it.
Enough's enough.

1134
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,607
Let's go.

1135
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,967
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.
Hold up.

1136
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,406
Where are you all going?

1137
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,522
We're leaving.
Really? What happened?

1138
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,443
Adrian Keane was in that bar.
Prick.

1139
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,965
I thought you liked
Adrian Keane.

1140
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,644
Adrian Keane is dead.
Oh, God.

1141
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,724
Adrian Keane died in a motorbike
accident in Italy eight years ago.

1142
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,609
Did he? They must have
had his DNA on file.

1143
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,011
That's how they were
able to replicate him.

1144
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,202
They know how to get to us, man.
They know everything.

1145
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,960
They didn't know Adrian was dead.
They knew enough to tempt us.

1146
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,486
They knew these three would fall for
a bunch of girls in school uniform.

1147
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:03,007
Hey, who wouldn't? Am I right?
Fuck,yeah.

1148
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,127
We've gotta get out of town,

1149
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,611
we've gotta get beyond it
before it's too late.

1150
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,564
- Where are you getting all this from?
- Basil.

1151
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,883
Mad Basil? He of the Bermuda
Rhombus and the Aqua Nazis?

1152
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,122
Another good name
for the band, Steve.

1153
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,964
You're putting our lives in
the hands of a crazy old man?

1154
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,610
He's not crazy!
No, maybe he's not.

1155
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,603
Or maybe he's a blank trying to
lure us to the edge of town,

1156
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,126
onto those dark country roads
where they can deal with us.

1157
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,488
Yeah, we could end up dead in a field.
I hate fields.

1158
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,847
Yes. My thoughts precisely.

1159
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,323
Steven's right.
We should go.

1160
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,731
No, we're going
to The Beehive.

1161
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,325
Gary's plan is still
the best we have.

1162
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,201
Wait a minute.

1163
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,729
The 1990-model Oliver was out of
commission by this point in the evening.

1164
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,161
What are you saying?

1165
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,208
I like the new you.
Huh.

1166
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,281
Come on.

1167
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,370
This is a mistake,
isn't it?

1168
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,566
Hold up!
Just stick with me.

1169
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,526
Andy, come on!

1170
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,165
Here we go. Pub number nine.

1171
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,207
FUCK yes!

1172
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,760
That's the spirit, Pete!
Spirits! We should do chasers.

1173
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,166
Who is this guy?

1174
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,687
Come on. Andy!
It can't start without you.

1175
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,361
You what?

1176
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,922
We can't start without you.

1177
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,841
Now then.
Whose round is it?

1178
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,451
It's mine.

1179
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,889
Mr. Shepherd!
Is it Mr. Shepherd?

1180
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,285
Why don't you kids join me? You look
like you could do with a drink.

1181
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:35,806
Now, let's have a little chat
about your future, shall we, hmm?

1182
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:39,283
Uh, Mr. Shepherd?
Please, call me Guy.

1183
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,601
All right.

1184
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,281
Guy...

1185
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,691
Look at you.

1186
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,441
Are you a robot?

1187
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,600
Does anyone know
what robot means?

1188
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,921
Yeah. I do!
Yes, Gary.

1189
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,850
It means "slave."

1190
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,922
Oh, very good, Gary.

1191
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,845
Are you a robot, sir?

1192
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,844
No, Peter, of course
I'm not a robot.

1193
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:04,961
Sir?
Yes, Steven.

1194
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,411
But you're on their
side, though?

1195
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,211
This is not about
sides, Steven.

1196
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,522
It's not about shirts
versus skins.

1197
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,281
It's about working
together as one team.

1198
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,001
I know it may seem a bit weird
and a little bit scary,

1199
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,802
but please believe me,
it's quite the opposite.

1200
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,490
They're here to help.

1201
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:27,007
To straighten us out. To
prepare us for the big league.

1202
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,682
They've seen something
in us, a potential.

1203
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,326
There's a vast community
of worlds up there,

1204
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:37,724
living together, peacefully,
cooperatively.

1205
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,204
And guess what? They want
us along for the ride.

1206
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,242
Pretty cool, eh, gang?

1207
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,966
So,
they're not here to harm us?

1208
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,445
Far from it, O-Man.
No, they're here to help.

1209
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,285
I'm not saying they're
afraid to get tough.

1210
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,131
I certainly had to get
tough with you in my day.

1211
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,683
And what one amongst you
wouldn't thank me for it? Hmm?

1212
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:05,168
In some respects,
they're a lot like teachers.

1213
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:09,529
Stern, yes.
A little frightening.

1214
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,125
But it's all for
our betterment.

1215
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:18,002
So, what do you say we all go somewhere
and talk about this properly?

1216
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,366
That wasn't properly?

1217
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,081
Well, I think it's pretty clear, guys, what
Mr. Shepherd is trying to say is that...

1218
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,041
Andy! What the fuck?

1219
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,726
Yes, Andy. What the fuck?

1220
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,371
WTF?

1221
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,405
Humans, you leave
us no recourse.

1222
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,610
If you will not
join us willingly,

1223
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:47,011
we will be forced to use
other means of persuasion.

1224
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,730
Now, please...

1225
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,969
I fucking hate this town!

1226
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,806
Oh, oh!

1227
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,249
Oh, crumbs, you're heavy. Sorry.

1228
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,171
Motherfucker!

1229
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,604
Andy!

1230
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,165
Twist the melon, man!

1231
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,371
Yeah!

1232
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:48,206
Sam, this is no way
for a family to behave.

1233
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,406
Sam, I'm disappointed
in you.

1234
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,842
O-Man!

1235
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,561
Okay, Andy.

1236
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,251
Break it up.

1237
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,570
It doesn't have
to be like this.

1238
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:35,802
It could be so much simpler,
so completely painless.

1239
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,762
If only you'd see the light.

1240
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,001
Yes.

1241
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,687
See, it's not
about conflict,

1242
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,369
it's about togetherness.

1243
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,569
Yes. Let's try this
again, shall we?

1244
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,161
How about another round?

1245
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:56,611
Nah, we're done here.

1246
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,961
Yes, Gary, that appears to be the case.

1247
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,451
The Smokehouse!

1248
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,160
What?
Just do it!

1249
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,121
Come on!

1250
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,041
This way!

1251
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,844
Humans,
this is your final warning.

1252
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,207
Failure to comply
will result in your...

1253
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,442
Humans, obey now,
or face the consequences.

1254
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:32,801
Let's go!

1255
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,046
Shit.

1256
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,006
Oh, look, there's my car!

1257
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,841
Let's climb down
the drainpipe.

1258
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,810
I've got a better idea.

1259
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,770
Climb down the drainpipe.

1260
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,726
Okay, just go.

1261
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,767
Wait. What about the others?

1262
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,365
Leave 'em with me, okay?
I got this.

1263
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,323
Are you sure? Yeah, I
always land on my feet.

1264
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,887
I don't know
if that's true, Gary.

1265
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,681
Just go.

1266
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,924
Will you find out what
happened to my brother?

1267
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,727
Yeah, of course, of course, and
I'll look after Stevie for you, eh?

1268
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,045
He's a good guy.
He's better than me.

1269
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,321
Gary, you're not a bad person, but
you're not boyfriend material.

1270
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,011
The whole "free spirit quick one
in the disabled toilets" thing

1271
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:30,880
is kinda cool when you're 17,
but not when you're facing 40.

1272
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,327
There comes a time when you have
to go forwards and not backwards.

1273
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,284
Maybe if I hadn't left you behind that
night, things would all be different.

1274
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,804
It's not all about
that night, Gary.

1275
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:43,761
Isn't it?

1276
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,686
It doesn't have to be.

1277
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,729
We'll always have the
disableds, though, won't we?

1278
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,451
Yeah. Yeah, we'll always
have the disableds.

1279
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,601
Oh, no.

1280
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,245
Where's Sam?

1281
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,726
I put her in her car.

1282
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:32,927
You did what?

1283
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,008
I put her in her car.
I just told her to leave.

1284
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,851
You just sent away the only one
of us sober enough to drive?

1285
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,161
Yeah. You just couldn't
stand the fact

1286
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,651
that she might
prefer me to you.

1287
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,404
That's not true.
it is true, Gary!

1288
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,449
I was getting somewhere.
We held hands.

1289
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,206
I was just trying to help! You were
trying to help yourself, more like!

1290
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,170
Jesus, I do something right for a
change and you fuckers get on my case.

1291
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,562
Wow, that's the first time I've
ever heard you admit being wrong.

1292
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,330
I said I did something right!

1293
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,606
Yeah, "for a change".

1294
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,808
So? Meaning the rest
of the time you're wrong.

1295
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,484
Not necessarily.

1296
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:04,803
Look, I just thought it was best
to keep her out of harm's way.

1297
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,167
And what about us, Gary?
Aren't we in harm's way?

1298
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,891
We're all right, Pete. Come on,
we're The Five Musketeers.

1299
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,042
No, we're the Four Musketeers.

1300
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,647
Wait, how do we know
you put her in the car?

1301
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,890
How do we know
you're you?

1302
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,086
Of course I'm me!

1303
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,482
Well, who the fuck are you, Gary?
I'm Gary King.

1304
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,526
There's only one Gary King. How
do I know you guys are you?

1305
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,011
We've been together
the whole time.

1306
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:32,449
You might all not be you. How did
you know O-Man wasn't O-Man?

1307
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,443
Because his birthmark
was back.

1308
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,761
What does that prove?
Because of what Basil said.

1309
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,410
They make a copy
from your DNA.

1310
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,766
That's why he had
his birthmark.

1311
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,251
He was new, like a baby.

1312
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,209
Like a man-baby.
Like a "maybe".

1313
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,521
Oliver with none of the shit that
had happened to the real Oliver.

1314
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,648
The laser surgery!

1315
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,165
So the blanks really
are just blank?

1316
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,524
No wear and tear, no scars.

1317
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,360
Steven, in 1987 we were playing
cricket and I accidentally pushed you

1318
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,568
onto a broken bottle that
nearly went up your ass.

1319
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:58,926
So?
Show us your bum.

1320
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,285
Very nice.
Thank you.

1321
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,966
Pete, you got that 50cc
Suzuki in 1988,

1322
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,690
and you let me have a go on it
and I ran over your leg.

1323
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,526
What the fuck?

1324
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,728
Oh, wait,
it's the other one.

1325
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,449
Andy, in 1986 we re-enacted
the Knife Game from <i>Aliens</i>

1326
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,925
and I stabbed you
in the middle finger.

1327
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,607
How about December 1997,
when you OD'd

1328
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,570
and I drove you to the hospital
four times over the limit

1329
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,565
and I ended up rolling the car and
almost severing my femoral artery,

1330
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,371
at which point you made
a miraculous fucking recovery

1331
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,649
and ran off into the night,
leaving me to get arrested

1332
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,768
after 12 hours of
life-saving surgery?

1333
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,566
Either one of those will do.

1334
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,162
Thank you.
What about you?

1335
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,605
That's easy.

1336
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,886
That could have been drawn on.
Aren't all tattoos drawn on?

1337
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,247
- Yeah.
- Show us your arm.

1338
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,605
What?
Show us your arm.

1339
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:02,727
No, no.

1340
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:07,602
You fell off stage at the fifth-year ball
fucking around and dislocated your elbow.

1341
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,842
You've got a scar where they
put the metal plate in.

1342
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,729
I don't have to show
you anything, all right?

1343
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,087
I'm Gary King.
I know I'm me.

1344
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,084
If I'm not me, then how do I know that
carved into that beam above your head

1345
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,168
are the words "King Gary"?

1346
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,366
But it doesn't say
"King Gary".

1347
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,920
Yes, it does.
Doesn't it?

1348
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,851
No. it says "King Gay".

1349
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,810
Some cunt scrubbed
out the "R"!

1350
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,325
- That was me.
- Why?

1351
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,971
"King Gay".
That means fuck-all anyway.

1352
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,168
Mr. Shepherd remembered
stuff, so did Oliver.

1353
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,488
Selective memory,
remember?

1354
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:43,451
We don't see you for years and you
just pitch up and bring us here.

1355
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,401
You better come out with some
hard evidence that you're human,

1356
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,367
otherwise we're going to
find out for ourselves.

1357
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,848
You want evidence?

1358
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,481
There!

1359
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,287
That proves I'm human!

1360
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,481
It proves you're stupid.

1361
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,800
Exactly!

1362
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,370
Ow!

1363
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,811
It's Gary.
It's Gary.

1364
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,042
The whole town's
out looking for us.

1365
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:15,169
That's a good thing. If everybody's
outside, that means nobody's inside.

1366
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,642
Gary, wait! Fuck!

1367
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,325
Gary, Gary! What do
you mean "nobody's inside"?

1368
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,765
I mean we can
still do this!

1369
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:25,921
Do what exactly?

1370
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,525
Oh, we're still on the crawl.

1371
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,760
"King Gay".

1372
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,240
Peter?

1373
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,486
Peter.

1374
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,647
I thought that was you.
Are you okay?

1375
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,690
Am I what?

1376
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,806
I know we didn't see
eye to eye at school.

1377
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,087
Goodness knows
I regret that.

1378
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,330
I wanted to say something
back at the pub,

1379
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,370
but I felt so terribly
ashamed by what I'd done.

1380
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,646
Let me make it up to you, Peter.
Please.

1381
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,042
Gary, you're out of your mind!
We've come too far.

1382
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,121
It's fucking suicide.

1383
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,966
I know. We are going to get to
The World's End if it kills us.

1384
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,724
Where's Pete?

1385
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,569
I hate you!

1386
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,411
You fucking bastard!
I hate you!

1387
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,729
Pete! Leave it! Why are
you doing this, Peter?

1388
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:19,966
We don't want to hurt you.

1389
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,724
Come on, mate!
It's not worth it!

1390
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,049
Yes, it fucking is!

1391
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,601
What's he doing?

1392
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,406
Oh, shit.

1393
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,321
Peter...

1394
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,401
Peter...

1395
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:39,729
I must say, I'm very
disappointed in you, Peter.

1396
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,042
I'll punch their
fucking lights out.

1397
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,724
Andy! No, no, no,
there's too many of them.

1398
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,441
Pete.

1399
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,161
Peter.

1400
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:10,730
We gotta go.
Gary's right.

1401
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,524
We gotta get to The King's Head.
Exactly.

1402
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,726
What?

1403
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,691
We are not going to The King's Head.
We're done.

1404
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,649
We're going to do what we should
have done in the first place.

1405
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:20,960
Get The Beast and
get out of here.

1406
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,290
We are fucking leaving
and we are never coming back.

1407
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,164
Now, you can either
come with us willingly

1408
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,164
or I'm gonna knock you the fuck
out and carry you there myself.

1409
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,242
You choose.
All right. All right.

1410
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,961
Just think about what you're saying, you
know, because you have been drinking.

1411
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:37,041
You fuck.

1412
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,484
Shit,
it's those fucking kids.

1413
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,130
Not them again.

1414
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,928
What the hell is that?

1415
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,480
I don't know, but it's
definitely not modern art.

1416
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:20,290
Oh, shit, we're trapped.
Where's The Beast?

1417
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:24,769
Okay, all right. We're here, so
The Beast is in the next street.

1418
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:25,921
How are we gonna
get to it?

1419
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,923
We'll have to go through.
Through where?

1420
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,889
I don't fucking
believe this.

1421
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,891
Number 10.

1422
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:37,681
Come on.

1423
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,961
Let's go.

1424
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,409
The back door, back door.
Let's go.

1425
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,361
Here we go.

1426
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,521
Okay, there it is.

1427
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,321
Shit.

1428
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,646
We wait for an opening, and
then we leg it to The Beast.

1429
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,324
We need the keys.

1430
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,046
Gary?

1431
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,567
Gary, what are you doing?

1432
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,290
Just a little toast.

1433
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,284
Gary, put the
pint down, yeah?

1434
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:15,409
To Oliver, Pete.

1435
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:17,601
And to us.

1436
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,408
You know, 'cause
10 pubs isn't bad.

1437
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,567
It's not, but
we're calling time.

1438
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,561
Okay.

1439
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,926
So close.

1440
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:48,967
Number 10.

1441
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:51,921
Okay.

1442
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,886
So close.

1443
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,489
No, no, no, no,
no. Gary!

1444
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,525
Gary! Gary!

1445
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,001
Let him go.
He left you, man.

1446
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:09,767
I can't.

1447
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,601
Andy!

1448
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,648
Gary! Gary!

1449
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,645
Gary, come back! Come
back, you stupid bastard!

1450
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:55,920
Gary!

1451
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,961
Gary! Gary!

1452
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,290
Andy, look out!

1453
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,241
Come on!

1454
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,201
What the...

1455
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,487
Get in. Get in.

1456
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,721
Gary, Andy, get the fuck in!

1457
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,811
You heard him, Andy.
Get the fuck in.

1458
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,809
We haven't much time!

1459
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,846
Andy! Go, now!
Steven!

1460
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,041
Go!

1461
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,001
Andy.

1462
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,444
I want you inside me.

1463
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,561
Okay.

1464
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,001
Cheers.

1465
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,731
Ah!

1466
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,686
You've had enough!
This is The World's End, man!

1467
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,926
I know!

1468
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:15,681
Stop this!

1469
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,971
Leave me alone!
What do you care anyway?

1470
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:23,601
Of course I fucking care. There's
a reason I'm angry at you!

1471
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,648
I know why you're angry
at me, okay?

1472
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:28,246
But it's not my fault
that you crashed that car.

1473
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,324
That's not the point.
You let me down, man.

1474
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:34,484
You were Gary King.
Gary fucking King.

1475
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:39,086
I would have followed you to the end.
I fucking have!

1476
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,367
Then stop following me!

1477
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,085
No! It's just one more.

1478
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,609
Let me have this.

1479
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,569
You've got everything
you want.

1480
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,005
What are you talking about?

1481
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:59,926
You've got your perfect job and your
perfect house and your perfect wife.

1482
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,411
You think it's so perfect?

1483
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,531
She left me, Gary.

1484
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,327
She took the kids to her
mum's three weeks ago.

1485
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,768
Said I'm not present enough.
I'm trying to win her back.

1486
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,410
And God knows
I am losing.

1487
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:17,530
But I will continue to fight,
because that is how we survive.

1488
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,725
For fuck's sake, Gary, I just punched
my wedding ring out of a robot's tummy.

1489
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,928
Exactly! You fight for
what's important.

1490
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,968
But what is so important
about The Golden Mile?

1491
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,565
It's all I've got!

1492
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,446
Gary.

1493
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,081
You need help, Gary.

1494
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:56,807
I got help.
You know what help was?

1495
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,922
Help was a lot of people
sitting in a circle

1496
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,923
talking about how fucking
awful things had got.

1497
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,847
That is not my idea
of a good time.

1498
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:08,003
And this is? They told
me when to go to bed.

1499
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:10,241
Me!

1500
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:16,444
Gary, mate, how can you tell when
you're drunk if you're never sober?

1501
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,409
I don't wanna be sober.

1502
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,411
It never got better
than that night.

1503
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,923
That was supposed to be
the beginning of my life.

1504
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,610
All that promise
and fucking optimism.

1505
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,367
That feeling like we could
take on the whole universe.

1506
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,610
It was a big lie.

1507
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,448
Nothing happened.

1508
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,204
You don't need
to do this, Gary.

1509
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,606
Yeah, I do.

1510
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,645
<i>Please, stand by.</i>

1511
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:54,245
<i>Please, stand by.</i>

1512
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,290
<i>Please, stand by.</i>

1513
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,010
<i>Please, stand by.</i>

1514
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,641
Ah!

1515
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,291
What are you doing?

1516
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,044
No, don't go out there.

1517
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,845
<i>Gary King.</i>

1518
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,200
Yeah?

1519
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,884
<i>Gary King of the humans.</i>

1520
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,049
Yeah. What do you want?

1521
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,882
<i>We are here to enable
your full potential,</i>

1522
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,328
<i>as we have with countless
worlds across the galaxy.</i>

1523
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,971
Oh, yeah?
How'd you manage that, then?

1524
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:17,526
We appropriate a small
percentage of the population

1525
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,922
at 2,000 or so penetration
points across the planet.

1526
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:24,010
This ensures maximum coverage.

1527
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:29,964
From there, we create simulants
to spread our ideologies

1528
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,724
through peaceful
indoctrination.

1529
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:36,001
Our objective is simple,
to ready the population

1530
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,726
for participation in
our galactic community.

1531
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:43,286
This method requires
a small sacrifice.

1532
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,727
But the fewer
replacements we make,

1533
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,081
the more successful
we consider our operation.

1534
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:52,722
Of course, we welcome those
who volunteer themselves.

1535
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,767
We can offer attractive incentives
for those who willingly combine.

1536
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:01,648
The chance to be young again and
yet retain selected memories.

1537
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,167
Isn't that something
you'd like?

1538
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,407
Something you've
always wanted?

1539
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:21,163
Oh, my God! I'm so cute!

1540
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:25,727
The beauty of our system
is that we all win.

1541
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,167
There are no losers.

1542
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,125
Allow me to carry
your legend forward.

1543
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:38,726
Let the man you have become
be the boy you were.

1544
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,969
Nah.

1545
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,008
There's only one Gary King.

1546
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,484
<i>Then you have made your choice,
Gary King of the humans.</i>

1547
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,251
Yeah, I have.

1548
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:07,247
Because frankly, who the fuck are you to
come down here and tell us what to do?

1549
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:11,769
<i>We are The Network and we are
here for your betterment.</i>

1550
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,251
<i>In the last 23 years,</i>

1551
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:16,290
<i>have you not marveled as information
technology has surged forward?</i>

1552
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,771
No.

1553
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:22,050
<i>Earth has grown smaller yet greater
as connectivity has grown.</i>

1554
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:25,647
<i>This is our doing and it
is just the beginning.</i>

1555
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,246
Oh, fuck off, you big lamp.

1556
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,689
<i>You are children
and you require guidance.</i>

1557
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,850
<i>There is no room
for imperfection.</i>

1558
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,846
Hey, Earth isn't perfect, all right?
And humans aren't perfect.

1559
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,367
And guess what?
I ain't perfect.

1560
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:43,763
<i>And therein lies the necessity
for this intervention.</i>

1561
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:48,368
<i>Must the galaxy be subjected to an
entire planet of people like you?</i>

1562
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:51,683
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1563
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,048
Who put you in charge, huh?

1564
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:56,441
Who are you to
criticize anyone?

1565
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,887
Now, you might think
Gary's a bit of a cock,

1566
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:02,802
and he is a bit of a cock,
but he's my cock.

1567
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:04,285
Oh, thanks, man.

1568
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:09,002
<i>But he is a detriment to himself, just
as Earth is a detriment to the galaxy.</i>

1569
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:10,127
What did you say?

1570
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:14,171
<i>You act out the same cycles of
self-destruction again and again.</i>

1571
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:19,241
<i>At this point your planet is the least
civilized in the entire galaxy.</i>

1572
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:22,245
What did he say? He's saying
we're a bunch of fuck-ups.

1573
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:26,002
Hey, it's our basic human
right to be fuck-ups.

1574
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:30,165
This civilization was founded on fuck-ups.
And you know what?

1575
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:32,681
That makes me proud.
And me!

1576
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:35,525
What is it they say?
"To err is..."

1577
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,081
"To err is human."

1578
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:40,721
"To err is human," so, uh...

1579
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,570
<i>We do not believe you
speak for all humanity.</i>

1580
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:47,689
<i>You are but two men.
Two drunk men.</i>

1581
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,444
Three drunk men!

1582
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,443
Stevie-baby!

1583
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,927
<i>Enough! Enough, humans!</i>

1584
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:03,361
Oh, you are in trouble now. It's
only the fucking Three Musketeers.

1585
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:07,331
<i>You are revolting against the
wisdom of countless solar systems.</i>

1586
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:08,845
Yeah, we are revolting!

1587
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,649
You just said you're not here to conquer.
Can I just ask,

1588
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,644
how many people did you have
to replace in Newton Haven?

1589
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,484
<i>That is irrelevant.
Is it?</i>

1590
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:21,885
Hands up.
Who here is human?

1591
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,930
I'm human.
One!

1592
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,684
And me.
That's two.

1593
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:30,202
I am. But don't
know for how long.

1594
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,805
Basil!
Shh...

1595
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:35,561
So what's that? Three? You had
to replace an entire town?

1596
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,880
<i>Not the entire town.</i>

1597
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:40,248
Everybody apart from old
Nutbowl and the Shifty twins.

1598
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,288
That's a good name for a band, Gary.
You should write that down.

1599
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,362
I will. What about the
ones you replaced,

1600
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:45,885
like Peter and Oliver?

1601
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,247
Yeah, what happened
to the empties?

1602
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,243
I told you
not to ask that!

1603
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:53,927
<i>Redundant vessels are recycled, mulched
and converted into fertilizer,</i>

1604
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,402
<i>whereupon they are returned to the
earth to promote verdancy and growth.</i>

1605
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:00,131
<i>It is a highly efficient
means of organic renewal.</i>

1606
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,440
Mulched?

1607
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,841
<i>It is a relative few in light
of our long-term plan.</i>

1608
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,163
You mean a few hundred thousand
turned to fucking compost?

1609
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,527
What about the other places?
The penetration points.

1610
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,609
Are they as successful
as Newton Haven?

1611
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:15,604
Because I'm guessing we're not
the only glitch in your system.

1612
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:19,162
<i>It is true, The Network has been
experiencing some difficulties.</i>

1613
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:22,682
I think you bit off more than
you can chew with Earth, mate.

1614
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:25,047
Yeah, 'cause we are more
belligerent, more stubborn

1615
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:27,367
and more idiotic
than you can possibly imagine,

1616
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,369
and I am not just
talking about Gary.

1617
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,044
Yeah, there's more
than one Gary King.

1618
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:34,044
But you said... I fucking
know what I fucking said!

1619
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:38,285
<i>Your reliance on profanity is a measure of
your immaturity as a man and a species.</i>

1620
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:42,604
Why don't you just get in your rocket and
fuck off back to Legoland, you cunts!

1621
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:46,441
Yeah! Stop fucking
Starbucking us, man! Yeah!

1622
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,204
<i>It is our duty
to challenge you.</i>

1623
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:51,045
Just leave us to our own devices,
you intergalactic arseholes.

1624
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,645
<i>You misunderstand.
Shut up!</i>

1625
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,529
We are trying...
Nobody's listening!

1626
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,601
<i>If you'd only...-</i>

1627
01:33:55,680 --> 01:34:00,891
Face it, we are the human race and
we don't like being told what to do.

1628
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,322
<i>Just what is it
that you want to do?</i>

1629
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,322
We want to be free!
Yeah.

1630
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,448
We want to be free to
do what we want to do!

1631
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,521
Yeah.

1632
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,204
We want to get loaded.
Yeah.

1633
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,169
And we want to
have a good time.

1634
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:17,527
And that's what
we're going to do.

1635
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,006
<i>It is pointless
arguing with you.</i>

1636
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,129
<i>You will be left to
your own devices.</i>

1637
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,884
Really?

1638
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,081
<i>Yeah.</i>

1639
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:28,761
<i>Fuck it.</i>

1640
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:41,091
They fucked off.

1641
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:49,289
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Up yours! Up yours! Up yours!

1642
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,321
Yeah, we did it!
We won, we won!

1643
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:59,129
Gary, let's Boo-Boo.

1644
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,445
Yeah, it's shit here,
innit?

1645
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:09,441
Oi, up here!

1646
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:10,881
Go!

1647
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,081
Get up.

1648
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:16,561
Come on!

1649
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,450
Well done.

1650
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:37,007
Thanks a bunch. Had to go
and spoil it, didn't you?

1651
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,003
Yeah, happy now?

1652
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,410
Basil, what do we do now?

1653
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,490
Same as before.

1654
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,369
Go!

1655
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:50,841
Where's The Beast?

1656
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,371
The Beast is dead,
mate.

1657
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,728
You know what... You know
what's really annoying?

1658
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:57,767
What?

1659
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:00,525
I promised myself I
wouldn't die in this town.

1660
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,010
You're not gonna.

1661
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,083
I think our luck just changed.

1662
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,764
Whoo-hoo!

1663
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,521
Oh!

1664
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:12,921
Sorry!

1665
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,002
Sam?
Yes.

1666
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:16,360
You came back for us!

1667
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:19,284
Yes, I did. Well, I got lost
on the ring road. But, yes.

1668
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:23,161
Hi, Sam, could you give us
a lift to London, please?

1669
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,049
Did you find out what
happened to my brother?

1670
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,167
We'll tell you on the way.

1671
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:30,441
Sorry about the mess. I've
been meaning to clear that up.

1672
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,727
We forgive you. Let's go.
Which way?

1673
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:34,601
Backwards!

1674
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,451
Which way now?

1675
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,400
Go straight over!

1676
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,250
We can make it.

1677
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:22,761
We're gonna make it.

1678
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,765
We made it!

1679
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,810
I'm sorry.

1680
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:38,720
I know.

1681
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:41,886
I know.

1682
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:43,765
<i>Everyone remembers
where they were</i>

1683
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,047
<i>when the lights went out
on Planet Earth.</i>

1684
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:50,449
<i>Me, Gary, Steven and Sam, we were
standing right by the switch.</i>

1685
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:54,404
<i>I guess it was
a big night for everyone.</i>

1686
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,283
That morning gave a whole new
meaning to the word "hangover"

1687
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:03,651
We decided to walk it off,
all the way back to London,

1688
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:08,161
but the headache didn't end there.
It just went on and on.

1689
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:11,530
Talk about the Big Smoke.

1690
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:18,127
When The Network went down, it
triggered some kind of pulse,

1691
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,763
wiped out all our technology

1692
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,370
and sent us here,

1693
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:29,208
back to the Dark Ages.

1694
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:33,563
There were casualties, of course.
I knew a few of them.

1695
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,846
Some guy from work, my
cousin Paul, Gary's mum.

1696
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:43,161
Nobody really knew
how many we lost,

1697
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:45,846
because we never heard from
the rest of the world again.

1698
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,649
<i>Everyone got cut off.</i>

1699
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:51,251
<i>It isn't easy now,
but it is simpler.</i>

1700
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:54,167
<i>I'm back with the wife,
which is something.</i>

1701
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:58,211
<i>We decided our problems didn't seem
as bad in the grand scheme of things.</i>

1702
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:02,171
<i>We all had to go organic in a
big way, but if I'm honest,</i>

1703
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:05,847
<i>I'm hard pressed to recall any
processed foods I actually miss.</i>

1704
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:13,162
As for the blanks, well, a
funny thing happened there.

1705
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,570
They woke up.

1706
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:20,084
<i>A week or so after The Network pulled out,
they just sort of rebooted by themselves,</i>

1707
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:22,764
<i>tried to start afresh.</i>

1708
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:28,331
<i>They seemed lost at first, children
cut off from their parents,</i>

1709
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,688
<i>abandoned, forgotten, looking for guidance,
for someone to show them the way.</i>

1710
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:36,808
<i>I felt a bit sorry for them,
to be honest.</i>

1711
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,324
<i>The Network was right
about one thing.</i>

1712
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,767
<i>We can be a bit uncivilized.</i>

1713
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:47,126
<i>Maybe we would've been a bad
influence on the rest of the galaxy.</i>

1714
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,725
<i>Oliver went back to
being an estate agent.</i>

1715
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,041
<i>People still need a roof
over their heads,</i>

1716
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,487
<i>and the old Ollie always
had a gift for the gab.</i>

1717
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:58,723
<i>I guess the new one has, too.</i>

1718
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,484
<i>He's doing all right.</i>

1719
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,046
<i>I hear that the Peter found his
way home to Bishop's Gardens.</i>

1720
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:08,160
<i>I suppose he picked up
where the other one left off.</i>

1721
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,481
<i>I'm not sure his wife noticed.</i>

1722
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:16,089
<i>Maybe she chose not to. He's a
pretty good dad by all accounts.</i>

1723
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,971
<i>Steven and Sam got
together in the end.</i>

1724
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:22,969
<i>Didn't see that coming.</i>

1725
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,247
<i>They shacked up
just outside London.</i>

1726
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:27,607
<i>It's a pretty nice shack, too.</i>

1727
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:31,169
As for Gary? I don't know
what happened to Gary.

1728
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:35,290
We got separated and
I never saw him again.

1729
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:39,882
Some say he went back to Newton Haven.
I don't know why.

1730
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,642
I think his business
there was done.

1731
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,684
<i>It's funny,
but I miss him.</i>

1732
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:51,526
<i>I wonder if he misses me.
Misses the boys.</i>

1733
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,680
<i>Wherever he is,
I hope he's happy.</i>

1734
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,008
<i>That's all he ever wanted,
really.</i>

1735
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:04,730
<i>To have a good time.</i>

1736
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:08,403
<i>I just hope he found it
beyond the bottom of a glass.</i>

1737
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:14,282
<i>Because real happiness, real friends,
those are things worth living for,</i>

1738
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,684
<i>worth fighting for.</i>

1739
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,245
Blank bastards.

1740
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,404
Fucking robots.

1741
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:47,084
Five waters, please.

1742
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:50,925
You can have one.

1743
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,569
But I ain't serving this scum.

1744
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:56,729
Well, I'm afraid it's all
for one and one for all.

1745
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:59,207
You see, my young friends
and I are on an adventure.

1746
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:02,887
A quest, if you will. And since we
find ourselves in need of refreshment,

1747
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,645
you, sir, have the honor
of drawing first blood.

1748
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,882
So, I'll ask you again,

1749
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,770
for the last time,

1750
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:15,203
five waters, please.

1751
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:26,046
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1752
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:30,286
Me? They call me The King.
