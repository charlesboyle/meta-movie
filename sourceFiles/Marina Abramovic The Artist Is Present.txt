1
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,133
Stop, stop .

2
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:48,366
- Up , Marina . 
- Do not look at me .

3
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,300
This is so beautiful !

4
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:03,533
Personnel in their positions .

5
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:07,033
Look firm , Kurt . 
Marcus , move close to Marina .

6
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:26,566
Fine, be like that . 
Perfect .

7
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,866
Raise your head , 
look at me .

8
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,533
The WOMEN'S EVOLUTION

9
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,200
You know what's interesting ? 
After 40 years ...

10
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:53,133
they think you 're crazy 
and should be in a mental hospital ...

11
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,633
you finally receive 
both recognition.

12
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:01,933
It takes so long 
to take us seriously .

13
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:06,200
Like this . That's right . 
Do not touch anything. Anyway .

14
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:10,500
It was a long way .

15
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:15,633
Welcome to the Art section 
of the program . It's amazing .

16
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,700
We're talking about the exhibition 
Museum of Modern Art .

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
She will make up 
eyebrows .

18
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,133
It is you who have to decide . 
Monica Morales went to see her .

19
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,100
There are three parts naked . 
Here's the first .

20
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:32,800
It's called \" Imponderabilia \" 
the artist Marina Abramovic .

21
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:36,133
- The name of the artist is Marina . 
- Marina .

22
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,066
- And the last name ? 
- I do not know .

23
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,266
Abramovic .

24
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,300
- It is eastern European . 
- You had already told me .

25
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,600
Marina Abramovic .

26
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,666
MUSEUM OF MODERN ART

27
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:50,100
THE ARTIST IS PRESENT

28
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,833
We can open shortly.

29
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,766
Ladies and gentlemen , 
do not run . Thank you .

30
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,233
I could not pass you .

31
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,366
Mom dressed me as Satan 
when I was four ...

32
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,466
to my first party.

33
00:04:57,566 --> 00:05:02,000
Everyone seemed happy 
how princesses and cowboys.

34
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,400
And I felt so miserable .

35
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,366
A child with a black dress 
sad Satan and two horns .

36
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,766
I do not know why 
so she dressed me .

37
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:22,200
I think it marked my life . 
We're recreating that image.

38
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,366
Look at me .

39
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,233
Sixty years later .

40
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:32,900
After the screening , I have to give 
more attention to my sex life .

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,933
I have to take care of it . 
If I put a photo like this ...

42
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:39,733
do you think it will attract 
some men ?

43
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:48,833
Semi - intellectual artist, on top 
Career singles looking .

44
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,266
You are seeing several 
Marinas basically.

45
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,333
You see a Marina ...

46
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,733
What is Product 
partisan parents ...

47
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:07,133
two national heroes , 
without limits , determined ...

48
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,866
grasping what is 
in front of her .

49
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,333
And near this 
Marina there is another ...

50
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,900
a child ...

51
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,800
whose mother never gave love 
enough , very vulnerable ...

52
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:24,500
and unbelievably 
disappointed and sad.

53
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:29,733
And there is another that has 
a certain spiritual wisdom ...

54
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,566
and can be 
above it all .

55
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,700
And this is my favorite .

56
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,933
SIX MONTHS AGO 
DISPLAY AT MoMA

57
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,400
This side of the line .

58
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:56,266
We have to do there ... 
it's there .

59
00:06:58,466 --> 00:06:59,533
We can ...

60
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,066
We have to start now .

61
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:06,266
- I think so ... 
- This is the coolest .

62
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:08,566
And then as well .

63
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,500
Here we already have 10 pieces . 
What is enough.

64
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,066
Yes , if they are well .

65
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:22,500
I love his name , August . 
Do you have a brother in September ?

66
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,300
Who will write the texts ?

67
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,000
- Will Klaus and his team . 
- Will Klaus ?

68
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,633
- Very well, then ... 
- I just will put them on the wall .

69
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,966
Good to know . 
Taste of Times font .

70
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,266
- Pleasure to meet you . 
- The type of letter.

71
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:41,466
And like the Russian font . 
But we can choose together.

72
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,866
- Okay . 
- Great . Thank you.

73
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,933
It is very red.

74
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:52,600
Yesterday we talked about letting them 
in black and white .

75
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,033
There will be color actually .

76
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:58,966
At least once , 
I wanted to show everything.

77
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:02,000
What is making art 
be an artist .

78
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,933
The both of correspondence, 
e-mails , faxes , letters ...

79
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:09,200
both the ticket 
air and all the rest .

80
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,366
The structure is huge . 
Show physical labor ...

81
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,700
that has nothing to do 
with creativity ...

82
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:15,966
just administration.

83
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,500
Office 
Marina Abramovic .

84
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,033
I will have six 
floors of MoMA .

85
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,233
- What is a big deal . 
- It's unbelievable .

86
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,600
I already feel back pain 
just thinking about it .

87
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:34,200
Be chronological . This is the beginning . 
My early work .

88
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:38,033
This work is called 
The Artist is Present ...

89
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:42,500
based on performances 
where the artist is present .

90
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:45,666
It does not include my objects 
transient sound pieces ...

91
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,033
objects with crystals . 
Only performance . Pure performance .

92
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,333
Everything is performance . 
If we have images ...

93
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,033
do not show anything but 
the images. It is very radical.

94
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,133
Therefore , this view at MoMA 
is historical and important to me .

95
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,200
It put things 
in the right places ...

96
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,200
performance because it never was 
a common art form .

97
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:09,333
It is an alternative 
since I was born .

98
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Want it to be a form 
Art and respect .

99
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:14,033
Before I die .

100
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:18,633
You too . Kiss.

101
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:22,600
Let's start 
with the display .

102
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:25,566
You will reinterpret 
his performances ?

103
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,633
- No, I will make a new piece . 
- One or several ?

104
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:31,133
Only one new piece . 
The Artist is Present .

105
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,600
The other people are ...

106
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,466
reinterpreting 
my five historic pieces .

107
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:41,800
I think his first performance was 
a museum in Belgrade .

108
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:43,733
This is ...

109
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,066
What kind of places ...

110
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:57,000
Marina , the sound is an inherent element 
in Relation in Movement ...

111
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,700
where you drive a van 
a square for 16 hours ...

112
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,200
while yelling numbers 
a megaphone.

113
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,100
You replaced your persona 
by a prostitute .

114
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:09,933
In Rhythm 2 , 
you took psychoactive drugs ...

115
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,133
to challenge 
social behavior ...

116
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,233
about women 
with mental illness .

117
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,066
Rhythm And five , you lay ...

118
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,833
inside a star 
wood burning ...

119
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,933
and fainted for lack 
of oxygen .

120
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:27,300
You have put your body 
in danger in these works ...

121
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:30,366
and you must be tired 
of these questions ...

122
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,200
but I want to talk about it 
before proceeding .

123
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,733
There is only one question 
I have not heard for 10 years ...

124
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,333
\" Why is this art? \"

125
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:40,533
Always ask me 
when it started ...

126
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,033
and I could not tolerate . 
Now I miss the question.

127
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,300
Nobody asks me that anymore . 
Maybe because of my age .

128
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:50,233
Finally understood 
understood or pretend to have .

129
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:54,866
If you are an alternative artist 
at 18, 19 , 20 years ...

130
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,100
and remains alternative 
at 29 and 30 years ...

131
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,566
and remains alternative 
also at 40 and 50 years ...

132
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:06,233
but I have 63 years . 
Do not wanna be an alternative .

133
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:14,533
Many people think it 
as the grandmother of performance art .

134
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,666
The art has to be beautiful . 
The artist must be beautiful .

135
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,266
Performance art 
emerged in the 60s ...

136
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,066
as a challenge to paint .

137
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,400
It was not something 
hung on the wall.

138
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:48,533
It is an art form 
where the object is the body .

139
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,466
In the case of Marina , 
she uses the human body ...

140
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:57,700
to express opinions 
that can be violent ...

141
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:00,000
or provocative .

142
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,400
It challenges the audience 
directly and boldly .

143
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:13,200
The essence of her work ...

144
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,266
is sharing 
the experience ...

145
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,233
between the audience and the artist .

146
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,166
Many of the works 
Marina are interventions .

147
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:32,500
Like when she did Rhythm 0 
Naples , with objects ...

148
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,000
and people could 
use them against her.

149
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:38,000
That's how 
Stanford Experiment , right?

150
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:42,533
It's a science experiment 
that reveals human nature .

151
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:46,300
But what is art , but the revelation 
human nature ?

152
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,066
It seems a mystery crime . 
Like Hitchcock .

153
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,366
She will be murdered ? 
Here 's the gun .

154
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,533
What will happen ? 
Who comes and who goes ?

155
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,533
The veneer of civilization 
is very thin .

156
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,233
And it's amazing 
how quickly ...

157
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,833
a group of people 
becomes animalistic ...

158
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,366
if you give him 
such permission .

159
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,300
Some of the performances 
initials of Marina ...

160
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,600
were about it .

161
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:18,866
By playing 
with the knife ...

162
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:23,500
Marina creates the intensity 
of her performances ...

163
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:26,700
which makes 
transcendental .

164
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,900
Marina chose

165
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:53,500
to reinterpret 
five of their historical pieces in MoMA .

166
00:13:57,133 --> 00:14:02,000
She invited for a workshop 
at her home in Hudson Valley .

167
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:06,900
The workshop 
is called \"Clearing House \" ...

168
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,466
to prepare 
for display at MoMA .

169
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,166
Let's cut together . 
And fast.

170
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,000
We have to cut all this 
and put into soup before 14h .

171
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:19,766
My generation of artists 
no longer acts .

172
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,833
I am one of the two 
or three others.

173
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:25,233
And I thought : 
\" It is my duty to make history ? \"

174
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,300
So when I was invited 
to make a display at MoMA ...

175
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,333
thought important 
for me and my ego ...

176
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,266
give five historical pieces ...

177
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,766
for young artists 
reinterpret .

178
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,033
They are coming 
and I 'm making soup .

179
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:23,200
She said that we will not 
eat or talk for three days .

180
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:24,833
That we hate it 's time ...

181
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:27,633
but then we love her 
and do what she wants .

182
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:31,400
Why do you look 
worried?

183
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,066
She wants us to stay 
fasting for three days ...

184
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,033
and said we will do 
exercises .

185
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,000
I believe in my instinct 
and think it is right to trust her .

186
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:47,800
Make your last 
telephone calls .

187
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,933
You will be free 
three days. That's incredible.

188
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:53,366
What will happen ?

189
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:56,000
- We 'll tell you later . 
- It does not matter .

190
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,633
This will be different.

191
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,600
They can use that experience 
and then do whatever they want .

192
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,733
But it is likely that they hate me . 
At least at the beginning .

193
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:13,100
It is a simple structure , 
and the idea is to control your body ...

194
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,266
and control your mind ...

195
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,100
in zero gravity 
if possible .

196
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:22,366
The first ritual is to wake up 
and do simple exercises ...

197
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,300
eg , skip 
and release some energy .

198
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:30,500
I will show you . It's simple . 
After going to the river .

199
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,866
If anyone has trouble 
Nude ...

200
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,533
bring a swimsuit, 
bikini, swimsuit , you want ...

201
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,166
or go naked , do not care .

202
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,500
We do this because they 
have to work three months ...

203
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,833
what a great 
type of obligation .

204
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:50,766
They have to create your own 
charismatic space ...

205
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:54,733
and for that, we have 
to consider some training .

206
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:01,233
The purpose 
is empty ourselves .

207
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:05,366
Being able to be 
at the present time .

208
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:09,633
Put our minds 
the here and now .

209
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:16,200
Then something appears emotional . 
It's what we want this work .

210
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,200
Performance is in need 
an emotional outlet.

211
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:27,400
It is a kind of direct dialogue 
between the audience and the artist .

212
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,100
And if you are this 100 % 
during the performance ...

213
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:42,066
emotional moment 
come for everyone.

214
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:45,666
There is no escape . 
Everyone feels it .

215
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:50,233
Artists have 
to be warriors ...

216
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:56,133
must be specified 
and have energy to conquer ...

217
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,900
not only new territory , 
but themselves ...

218
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:04,400
and weaknesses.

219
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,533
No matter what job 
that makes as an artist ...

220
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:13,566
the most important is the state 
mental that you realize .

221
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,333
Performance is a 
matter of mental state .

222
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,133
So ...

223
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,666
wait and see.

224
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,133
Marina Abramovic : 
The Artist is Present ...

225
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,466
mean of 9 
March to May 31 ...

226
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,000
whenever you 
enter the museum ...

227
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,700
can be at nine thirty 
morning or afternoon at five ...

228
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,466
she will be present .

229
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,700
Just as I thought The Artist 
Gift is a salon?

230
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,200
Like a movie set .

231
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:38,066
There is a square 
huge light.

232
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:42,300
Only the square , as in the movie 
Lost in Translation .

233
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:45,266
In the middle of the square , 
there is a table and two chairs .

234
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,866
It's simple , it's like not 
there was nothing .

235
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,900
Only the artist sitting . 
I want to be there like a stone .

236
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:53,133
Only three months .

237
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:55,733
And look in his eyes .

238
00:19:57,366 --> 00:20:00,200
Will be three months . 
Everyday.

239
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:07,133
If you work three months 
performance becomes reality.

240
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:15,633
No one understands that more difficult 
is doing something that is almost nothing .

241
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,733
This requires 100 % of you 
no more story to tell ...

242
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:23,866
there are no objects behind which 
hide. There is nothing .

243
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:28,200
It is their sheer presence , you just 
have your energy and nothing else .

244
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:32,633
Seven and a half hours , 
six days a week.

245
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
Without moving.

246
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,833
I have nothing to say.

247
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:44,333
No comments . 
Just respect.

248
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:48,266
I find unbearable 
sit without moving.

249
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,000
She tries .

250
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:56,400
Do not know if will work .

251
00:20:57,766 --> 00:20:59,066
Can I show you ?

252
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,233
When she had this idea 
thought : \" She's going to kill. \"

253
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,500
I said : \" Marina , do not know 
if you want the responsibility ...

254
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,766
give you permission 
to do this .

255
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,733
Think about it a couple of days . \"

256
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:18,566
She called me the next day 
and said, \" I can do that . \"

257
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,166
Once Klaus Biesenbach 
created the name of the show ...

258
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:26,100
The Artist is Present , 
was as a destination .

259
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:30,033
Liked at the time . The Artist 
is Present , can not escape .

260
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,766
Look. This is not fantastic ?

261
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:35,466
- It is aesthetic . 
- No one will see it .

262
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,533
There will be 
the flood museum.

263
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,133
Maybe I will not use it .

264
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,300
I am telling you 
never use . You promised .

265
00:21:47,466 --> 00:21:50,733
Well , this is a 
security issue ...

266
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,333
Men do not understand . 
I think that is good.

267
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,533
He did not want to deal 
with reality .

268
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,266
It fits well. I think it was 
a brilliant solution .

269
00:21:58,466 --> 00:22:02,866
I do not know why I have to do 
increasingly difficult.

270
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,300
I could have done 
a retrospective .

271
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:08,500
Thirty- six people 
reinterpreting my pieces .

272
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:12,200
A dinner to celebrate 
go home and the job was done .

273
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:17,333
Why must I do this ? 
It seems the cross I bear.

274
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,933
It's crazy . God 
help me take it to the end .

275
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,300
When you watch one 
performance of Marina Abramovic ...

276
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:34,800
you are engaged 
in the physical presence of her ...

277
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,666
that is impressive.

278
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:42,400
The evidence of the tremendous force 
and physical energy it ...

279
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:45,866
that the presence 
of the public gives you ...

280
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,600
is clearly innate .

281
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:53,666
She can sit still, 
or do very little ...

282
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,800
or what she is doing 
in performance for long.

283
00:22:57,966 --> 00:23:00,066
Most people 
fail .

284
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,700
My parents are heroes 
national the time of Tito ...

285
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,733
during the Second 
War in the former Yugoslavia .

286
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,200
Had much control 
in my house , which I hated .

287
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:21,400
Everything was disciplined, 
with time .

288
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,933
I was trained 
to be a soldier .

289
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:26,233
Mom woke me up 
in the night ...

290
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:29,200
I was asleep 
in a rumpled bed .

291
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:32,400
That was kind of crazy. 
There was no love .

292
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:36,666
I do not remember Mom 
kissing me or hugging .

293
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,666
Later, when she asked : 
\" Why would you ever kiss me? \"

294
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:42,633
She was surprised and said ...

295
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,033
\" Of course not , 
I do not want to spoil it . \"

296
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:49,233
She not spoiled me , 
but I had a loving grandmother ...

297
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:53,966
present, religious , 
passed all the time in church .

298
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,500
I spent much time with her ...

299
00:23:56,633 --> 00:24:00,100
because my parents were political , 
had no time for me .

300
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,233
There is a strange mixture ...

301
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,733
between religiosity 
and that Communist discipline.

302
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:09,700
Today I see it 
was important to me ...

303
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:12,666
it made me 
who I am.

304
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:16,366
THREE MONTHS BEFORE 
DISPLAY AT MoMA

305
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:20,366
FLORENCE , ITALY

306
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:24,233
- Nice to meet you . 
- Welcome to Florence .

307
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:25,233
Thank you.

308
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:28,166
I had to go to the bathroom 
at the airport ...

309
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:31,100
and made ​​a discovery 
fantastic .

310
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,766
Two pages with illustrations . 
\" How to wash your hands ...

311
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,966
with soap and water . \"

312
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:45,400
Brilliant.

313
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,233
We are here today ...

314
00:24:50,566 --> 00:24:54,033
for the delivery of important 
Lorenzo Magnifico Award ...

315
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,233
Marina Abramovic .

316
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:57,700
Thank you.

317
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:00,466
I need the microphone ?

318
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,166
I thought I'd 
lecture in the end ...

319
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,666
but do not think this 
is the occasion to lecture.

320
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,266
I'd rather have a dialogue 
with the public .

321
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,466
Before that , I read 
My manifesto for you .

322
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:26,333
I wrote my manifesto 
heart .

323
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:30,100
He is also funny, 
at the same time.

324
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,200
But it's true .

325
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:37,233
\" An artist should not lie 
to himself or others.

326
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,200
An artist should not steal 
ideas from another artist.

327
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,566
An artist should not 
to commit himself ...

328
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,200
or the art market .

329
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,000
An artist should not 
kill another human being .

330
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,600
An artist should not 
do idol .

331
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,766
An artist is related . 
To your love life \"

332
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,333
No, love life .

333
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,500
Loving .

334
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,066
\" An artist should avoid 
fall in love with another artist .

335
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,766
An artist should avoid 
fall in love with another artist .

336
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,400
An artist should avoid . 
Fall in love with another artist \"

337
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,633
We met 
when she came to Amsterdam .

338
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:54,900
She was going to perform.

339
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:58,400
I met her before and thought ...

340
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:02,300
The exhibition was called 
Thomas Lips .

341
00:27:02,466 --> 00:27:04,400
During the performance ...

342
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:07,500
she made a pentagram 
belly with a razor ...

343
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,300
and whipped .

344
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,066
I thought, \" Maybe not . \"

345
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,633
Then I started 
to notice the wounds .

346
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:22,533
Do not licked , but took care 
and cleaned the wounds ...

347
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,600
put something in them , and I think 
that was the crux .

348
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,766
When we met 
there was an immediate fascination.

349
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:36,900
By type , character 
personality ...

350
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:40,300
the work we did 
individually.

351
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:45,733
It was as if we had found 
lost a brother or sister.

352
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:46,866
It was something.

353
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,033
And born on the same day ,

354
00:27:51,366 --> 00:27:52,333
Obviously .

355
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,733
Fate brought us together .

356
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,133
I loved him very much . 
More than myself .

357
00:28:01,933 --> 00:28:05,866
For me , when we started 
working together, it was forever.

358
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,600
I thought that relationship 
and work and never would end .

359
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:14,500
Were two conjoined twins 
the body and soul .

360
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:20,733
Were lovers , we were 
friends were artists ...

361
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,300
all at the same time.

362
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:26,166
And our love was 
always above that.

363
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,500
The relationship of Marina and Ulay 
is a great love story .

364
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,233
Marina has no limits ...

365
00:28:35,366 --> 00:28:40,366
and met someone who 
was prepared for all the art .

366
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,500
That must have impressed her 
because she met her partner.

367
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:51,633
When Marina and Ulay started 
the workgroup ...

368
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:53,600
known 
as Relation Works ...

369
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:57,100
nothing like it had been 
made ​​until then.

370
00:28:58,633 --> 00:29:02,966
Our bodies were 
of confrontational way ...

371
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,766
because we wanted to show 
the man / woman conflict ...

372
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,933
traumatic experiences 
about relationships .

373
00:29:09,966 --> 00:29:13,366
We filled 
purple marks at the time.

374
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,233
But it did not hurt .

375
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:38,800
Our 12 years have been so 
intense , heavy and powerful ...

376
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:41,866
as a lifetime 
other people 's .

377
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,066
We passed through several stages . 
Falling in Love, stay together 12 years .

378
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:52,833
For the first time 
in 23 years ...

379
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,300
we get 
under the same roof .

380
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:03,700
Ulay arrive at 14h . 
This is the first time ...

381
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:07,733
Ulay who comes to this 
apartment in New York .

382
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:09,700
He never came here 
or the other.

383
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:14,600
They are separated for years . 
Come join us to talk about it .

384
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,933
I do not know what will happen , 
but it will be interesting.

385
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,066
For sure .

386
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,166
- How will 
- I'm fine.

387
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:33,100
I just get the analyst.

388
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:36,600
Dr. Glimour . 
A special lady .

389
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:39,200
Very strict . 
Taste of rigor .

390
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,266
By bit 
she does not wear uniform.

391
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:45,466
She told me I'm not 
so badly emotionally ...

392
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:49,266
and that I should explore 
more my childhood ...

393
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,866
and not repeat the same patterns 
next relationship.

394
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:58,233
I told him about Ulay and she thinks 
that the meeting can be easy ...

395
00:30:58,366 --> 00:31:02,900
or not . We do not know . 
Let me take a glass - d ?? water.

396
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:08,966
Both are in the third 
act of our lives .

397
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:13,566
There is no other moment 
to approach ...

398
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:15,000
and forgive us.

399
00:31:15,466 --> 00:31:19,233
And peacefully understand 
that was terrible ...

400
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:23,600
painful and hateful 
when we were together ...

401
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:27,466
but was creative while 
and we must forgive ourselves .

402
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:32,033
You're in the wrong building ?

403
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,766
- The Performing Garage is here. 
- This is my building .

404
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,866
Hello , dear .

405
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,500
How should I call it ? Grandma 
diva or performance art ?

406
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,566
Come in.

407
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,500
I think I still love her . 
I can live with that .

408
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:47,900
I'm happy. 
It's better than hate her .

409
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:51,233
Here is my loft . 
You know Davide ?

410
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,366
- That nothing . 
- My assistant .

411
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,466
- Hello , Davide . 
- Did you ever know .

412
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,333
I saw him in the office , right?

413
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,566
- It is you who sends the emails . 
- Am .

414
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:04,566
Davide is a young artist . 
And the good . He is Turin .

415
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:07,066
- David- ê 
- Not David . It is Davide .

416
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:10,900
- How are you going ? 
- I'm fine . Look at me .

417
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:12,200
Certainly .

418
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,500
If I can help , 
will be a pleasure .

419
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:18,333
If I can do something 
for her , will be a pleasure .

420
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:21,933
Depends on what , 
but for now , yes, of course .

421
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:25,900
I can only do two things . 
Helping or be good .

422
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,400
It's an amazing apartment . 
You are always here , Davide ?

423
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:31,033
Yes , almost always .

424
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,833
I try to do the same . 
Here is great .

425
00:32:35,033 --> 00:32:37,000
Maybe she still 
love me. I do not know .

426
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:41,033
Tomorrow we'll find out . 
Tomorrow or later.

427
00:32:41,566 --> 00:32:44,733
And maybe I \" put a 
finger in her tooth.\"

428
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:50,333
- Put a finger in her tooth ? 
- This means doing something sensible .

429
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:54,366
REACHING THE LIMIT

430
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,933
Marina , you're nervous 
with the exhibition at MoMA ?

431
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:07,666
Very . I'm nervous up 
to make speech.

432
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,400
- Fico days in the bathroom . 
- Okay .

433
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:13,033
If I'm not nervous , 
I get so nervous .

434
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,266
You will move 
a bit in the chair ...

435
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,500
going to and fro 
or will be in the same position ?

436
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:27,133
In the same position . 
I'm not moving .

437
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:28,966
Where will you look ?

438
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,266
For those who sit 
in front of me .

439
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,400
There will be a chair 
in front of you ?

440
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,966
Yes , one can 
as you want to sit .

441
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,066
In front .

442
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,766
There will be 11-15 thousand people 
MoMA . Will only stare.

443
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:52,466
Marina seduces everyone you know . 
Is not the case with me ...

444
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:56,500
because I've been through this process 
and now we are divorced .

445
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,100
We are great friends , 
but divorced .

446
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:02,033
He would never try to seduce me 
because we are divorced .

447
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,600
With Marina , always try 
to separate the artist from the person ...

448
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:15,100
with whom I relate 
professionally.

449
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:18,266
I try to deal with it 
as if it were a sculpture .

450
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,566
I see her work 
as an object .

451
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:24,066
I try to be objective with it ...

452
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,766
because they do not want 
the artist interfere .

453
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:35,066
Because Marina 
never stops acting .

454
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,866
Marina , you do not 
need this ?

455
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:47,033
Are you sure ?

456
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:51,533
He makes the wine disappear .

457
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:54,366
I can teach her how to do 
this is fun.

458
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:07,300
I just met someone ...

459
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,933
they thought I should 
really know ...

460
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:14,966
and it happened at MoMA . 
So we came here , we drink ...

461
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:18,000
and he is a guy 
interesting.

462
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:20,200
He is a magician . 
David Blaine .

463
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:31,200
He thinks he can do something 
during my exhibition at MoMA .

464
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:36,200
Knows the axes behind glass 
in case of emergency?

465
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,133
I thought about using one 
substance that she has ...

466
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:45,033
and choke her with it . People 
would find it very strange .

467
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,066
Then , break the glass , take 
the ax and start cutting it .

468
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,900
Then the ambulance arrives ...

469
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:53,866
they put a 
covered about me ...

470
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,566
there's blood everywhere . 
And the police arrive and arrest him .

471
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,600
She is lying there 
and that's the end of the exhibition .

472
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:04,866
And people do not know 
it was an accident .

473
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,033
Questioning 
if it is real or not .

474
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:12,066
- And I will strike violently . 
- Have you done this ?

475
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:18,566
If I do this two times 
, is an illusion .

476
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:21,600
But when you do it 
since it is madness .

477
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:25,333
Fantastic Marina 
is that it will be at MoMA .

478
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:29,800
That is the public 
perfect for this.

479
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:31,100
Certainly .

480
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:36,800
- What do you think ? 
- I think it's a bad idea .

481
00:36:37,366 --> 00:36:38,333
Why ?

482
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,733
It is an interesting subject 
and does amazing things ...

483
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,733
but culturally 
some people ...

484
00:36:45,966 --> 00:36:48,033
call people 
so magical ...

485
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,266
it should rather be 
called illusionist ...

486
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,366
and that says it all .

487
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:56,866
His work has nothing 
to do with illusionism .

488
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,633
He is real. And make the connection 
between these works at the MoMA ...

489
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:05,566
the more important exhibition 
you have done in your career ...

490
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,400
would be a disaster . I think 
that is the wrong thing to do .

491
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:13,266
I oppose with all 
my being . How about this ?

492
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,466
Done ! You are right . 
I accept .

493
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:18,166
- Done . 
- Thank you.

494
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:22,233
We work with nine galleries . 
Marina And now is a giant .

495
00:37:22,766 --> 00:37:24,533
But Sean has supported us ...

496
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:28,666
when nobody wanted to 
deal with problems ...

497
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,033
to have a performance artist 
in the context of a gallery .

498
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:35,500
Answer me .

499
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,166
Among blue ...

500
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:41,566
and red, 
which do you prefer?

501
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,566
- What is your first instinct ? 
- Red .

502
00:37:46,866 --> 00:37:50,566
Klaus chose blue , 
but all want the red.

503
00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:53,866
Performances by nature 
are ephemeral .

504
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:56,566
Then carefully 
select a photo ...

505
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:58,966
to represent 
each performance ...

506
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:02,533
and transform 
in books and sell them.

507
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,300
This is fantastic .

508
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,700
We had minor issues .

509
00:38:07,566 --> 00:38:09,866
That was 20 years ago ...

510
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:14,466
and sell for two 
to five thousand dollars each .

511
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:19,600
And now they are highly sought 
and if you can find them ...

512
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,333
they are worth between 25 
and $ 50,000 each .

513
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,966
There is a drama in these photos .

514
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
The model we created for Marina 
and how it created the market ...

515
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:33,600
has become a standard 
observed by others.

516
00:38:34,466 --> 00:38:35,533
So that's it .

517
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:42,633
ART IS EASY

518
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,000
In the 70s , with Ulay , 
took the radical decision ...

519
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,466
living in a car.

520
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,600
Not needed to pay 
phone bills ...

521
00:38:56,733 --> 00:39:00,000
light rental . 
And we had no money .

522
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,000
We did not want to do 
anything besides acting .

523
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:07,800
Igor , this is the van where I lived . 
I lived in it so long ...

524
00:39:08,033 --> 00:39:11,700
and two days ago you said 
she is beautiful .

525
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:15,466
And I said, \" Linda in a museum , 
but it was a hard life ...

526
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:18,733
I had nothing . 
lovely \" Let's go .

527
00:39:20,366 --> 00:39:23,100
It had been over 30 years 
I did not see that car .

528
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:27,566
And when I saw him at the museum , 
I had an unexpected feeling .

529
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,166
It was like a past life 
come to meet me .

530
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:38,700
We live in the countryside with shepherds , 
we took milk of goats .

531
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:41,766
We were going with empty bottle 
mineral water ...

532
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,833
borrow petrol 
the posts .

533
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:48,533
I knew all the showers 
and gas stations in Europe .

534
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:51,033
This van drives me 
thrilled .

535
00:39:53,233 --> 00:39:56,933
Gee , I heart 
party to look the van .

536
00:39:57,066 --> 00:40:01,166
I remember how there was so much belief 
hope and innocence ...

537
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,533
in our life at that time .

538
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:09,333
It was a very happy time 
in my life right car.

539
00:40:09,766 --> 00:40:12,833
I had everything I ever wanted . 
The man I loved ...

540
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:15,500
working together , 
being radicals ...

541
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,933
and without words 
no commitment .

542
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,966
There were two of us 
the dog and the universe .

543
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,200
I see that way 
amazing from there to here .

544
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:32,166
It's a long way .

545
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:39,900
I have to prepare the display . 
No time .

546
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:45,333
Marina knitting 
sweaters for us .

547
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,600
I repaired and always ran 
the car . Marina did not drive .

548
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,800
We had only the basics . 
We were like modern nomads .

549
00:40:57,366 --> 00:41:02,233
But it was the best time . 
We had a lot of energy and power.

550
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,766
Here is the Hudson River?

551
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,933
Here is Hudson. Go ahead . 
Red light , stop .

552
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,200
Green light , go .

553
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:23,900
Let's stop here 
because I want to drive now .

554
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,633
It is my historic moment .

555
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:28,500
'll Drive for you 
the first time in life.

556
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,733
I am willing 
to sit beside her .

557
00:41:37,466 --> 00:41:38,400
Ulay .

558
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:42,833
Never thought 
would reach it . Never .

559
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,733
- The lighthouse is lit ? 
- Right .

560
00:41:48,866 --> 00:41:50,833
- Nope. Lighthouse is lit 
- Yes , it is.

561
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:53,766
- That's great . 
- I had already called the lighthouse .

562
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,866
The handbrake 
is down ?

563
00:41:55,966 --> 00:41:57,966
He was pulled . 
Not now .

564
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,866
I knew there was something 
wrong.

565
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:07,666
Let's stroll . You're 
in my hands now .

566
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,400
It was what I feared.

567
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:14,733
Turn right most . 
A little more . Stop .

568
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,500
Go, go . Is perfect.

569
00:42:20,933 --> 00:42:21,900
Go ahead .

570
00:42:22,566 --> 00:42:25,500
Only one meter, 
or pass through the door .

571
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,566
Well , I'm 
a little nervous ...

572
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,600
but surprised .

573
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,666
From one to 10 , Ulay , 
what do you think ? Five ?

574
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,766
- More . 
- Six ?

575
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,166
More.

576
00:42:42,033 --> 00:42:44,466
- Okay, seven and a half . 
- No seven .

577
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:47,600
Seven is a good number .

578
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:49,500
Great .

579
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,533
Very well .

580
00:42:59,633 --> 00:43:02,466
Abramovic . 
You work hard .

581
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,733
- I only know how to do that. 
- It is true .

582
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,100
I will make zucchini sauce 
pasta with this .

583
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:12,500
Our relationship 
was based on tasks ...

584
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:17,400
of man and woman. 
He did everything in the outside world ...

585
00:43:17,633 --> 00:43:20,900
took loans 
money was going to the bank .

586
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:24,066
And I cleaned , washed 
and took care of the dog.

587
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,566
When we parted , 
I had no bank account .

588
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,866
I did not know 
how it worked .

589
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,033
It took me a while to 
learn everything from scratch .

590
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:35,533
You have opener ?

591
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:41,766
After our simple life 
she became too ambitious .

592
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,266
Both at work 
as in life itself ...

593
00:43:46,933 --> 00:43:49,333
with respect 
the image and wealth.

594
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:55,666
And I kept more in line 
stable , straight after the split .

595
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,633
She climbed a 
huge mountain ...

596
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:01,200
with much success .

597
00:44:02,533 --> 00:44:05,900
This may be weird , but not 
have time to push myself ...

598
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:09,233
to make it 
possible for me .

599
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:15,100
But no need to do this , 
I'll marry her .

600
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:21,233
Okay if I do 
the food a bit spicy ?

601
00:44:23,066 --> 00:44:24,166
Pepperoncini ?

602
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:29,500
I believe there are not many 
artists working both ...

603
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:31,233
as Marina .

604
00:44:32,033 --> 00:44:34,966
But she is always 
very elegant .

605
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:41,666
I look like a 
field worker .

606
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,000
I am a worker 
in art .

607
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:47,733
I look like a worker, 
but much less work .

608
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:53,066
Well , you know 
what I mean .

609
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:55,933
'm Lazy .

610
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:04,400
The Nightsea Crossing is 
a man and a woman ...

611
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,933
sitting in front 
of each other in chairs .

612
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,400
Sitting without moving, 
silent ...

613
00:45:11,366 --> 00:45:12,366
and fast.

614
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,300
This portrays what is despised 
in Western society .

615
00:45:20,766 --> 00:45:25,666
Inactivity, lack of action 
silence are discredited ...

616
00:45:26,466 --> 00:45:28,200
Fasting is discredited .

617
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:31,666
These three things 
irritated people ...

618
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,633
especially when it lasted 
four, five , six, seven ...

619
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:38,233
eight, nine , ten, eleven , twelve 
thirteen , fourteen, fifteen ...

620
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:39,466
sixteen days .

621
00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:45,233
Inactivity, silence , fasting , 
absolutely still ...

622
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,966
which is almost impossible.

623
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,200
We did Nightsea Crossing 
for 90 non-consecutive days .

624
00:45:55,233 --> 00:45:56,500
Once I got up .

625
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,100
Not take it anymore .

626
00:46:02,466 --> 00:46:04,733
A woman sits better 
than the man ...

627
00:46:04,866 --> 00:46:10,033
because of the anatomy . 
I gave up after 13 or 14 days .

628
00:46:10,466 --> 00:46:14,800
My ribs were 
pushing so hard my spleen ...

629
00:46:15,233 --> 00:46:19,266
they said at the hospital : 
\" You should stop fasting . \"

630
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,866
I had already lost 10kg .

631
00:46:24,466 --> 00:46:28,133
This was beyond the bounds 
on my part .

632
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,966
Once .

633
00:46:32,966 --> 00:46:36,133
He could not sit 
because he was so skinny ...

634
00:46:36,233 --> 00:46:39,400
bones 
penetrated his skin .

635
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,133
Yogis do the same . 
But he did not .

636
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,866
Then he said : 
\" You have to get up ...

637
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,166
it might not make 
it without me . \"

638
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,466
And I saw no reason for that.

639
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,200
So keep doing 
the Nightsea Crossing.

640
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,366
Still , 
but with the empty chair .

641
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:13,166
Never had a relationship 
with a woman , or man ...

642
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,900
with such a degree 
symbiotic quality.

643
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,400
Twelve years have left us 
exhausted .

644
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:33,833
The Marina - Ulay , collaboration 
in a simple, direct ...

645
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:38,366
and deep , expressing 
dynamic man / woman ...

646
00:47:38,866 --> 00:47:41,633
and reaches a 
epic conclusion ...

647
00:47:42,566 --> 00:47:46,300
to walk on the Wall 
China called The Lovers .

648
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:50,866
She goes beyond what is 
extravagant in proportion .

649
00:47:54,366 --> 00:47:59,300
The Lovers , where Marina and Ulay 
walked in Wall of China ...

650
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:01,333
was an epic .

651
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:07,233
The process of three months 
walking toward each other ...

652
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:15,400
was very simple , without exaggeration 
and extraordinarily clear .

653
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:23,266
This was the last work 
them in Relation Works .

654
00:48:26,766 --> 00:48:32,400
And walk in Wall of China 
ended with their separation .

655
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,166
Soon became 
a great couple of artists ...

656
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,900
and all projected 
a perfect image .

657
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:46,200
Actually , 
he was not happy ...

658
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:49,500
and as they were better 
our work ...

659
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,200
was our worst 
private relationship.

660
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:58,466
And then , his interests 
were different from mine ...

661
00:48:58,566 --> 00:49:02,866
and he was experiencing 
life , drinking , using drugs .

662
00:49:03,033 --> 00:49:06,700
Then he became unfaithful , 
which was very difficult for me .

663
00:49:08,566 --> 00:49:11,400
We were monogamous 
to a point .

664
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:17,400
When the rigor of that ideology 
began to unravel ...

665
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,500
started ...

666
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:23,100
to disintegrate .

667
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:28,266
Then , at the time, she had a 
Sexual adventure with someone ...

668
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,900
as I had .

669
00:49:30,866 --> 00:49:35,466
At the same time . Except she 
chose a friend of ours . I did not .

670
00:49:37,566 --> 00:49:39,233
I should not have said that .

671
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:48,733
It took us eight years 
trading permission ...

672
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:50,600
to walk 
in Wall of China ...

673
00:49:50,733 --> 00:49:54,400
and he had to go to China several 
times . She was the translator.

674
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:58,900
When finished with the wall , 
he told me she was pregnant .

675
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,066
E asked : 
\" What do I do ? \"

676
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,700
I said, \" What do you do ?

677
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,566
I'm leaving and you 
do what you want . \"

678
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,466
Then they got married.

679
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:13,266
It was like the beginning . 
Ended as it began .

680
00:50:13,366 --> 00:50:16,233
Started quickly 
and ended quickly .

681
00:50:18,566 --> 00:50:19,533
Was well .

682
00:50:24,533 --> 00:50:26,400
After I separated 
of Ulay ...

683
00:50:26,533 --> 00:50:29,133
lived more time 
dramatic of my life .

684
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:33,933
I wrote in my diary : 
\" I'm 40 , overweight ...

685
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:35,900
ugly and undesirable . \"

686
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:40,166
I thought, \" God , I lost the man 
I love and my work . \"

687
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:43,666
We worked together. 
There was nothing . He was empty .

688
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,600
And it would be a new beginning ...

689
00:50:45,633 --> 00:50:49,666
or I would destroy me 
with depression .

690
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,133
It was the first time I received 
a penny in Paris ...

691
00:50:56,266 --> 00:51:01,233
and bought clothing couture . 
I felt great .

692
00:51:01,533 --> 00:51:06,233
I went to the hairdresser , did pedicure 
manicure. It was great .

693
00:51:07,133 --> 00:51:10,600
What is the price of this jacket ? 
He is priceless .

694
00:51:10,733 --> 00:51:13,033
- You can not pay for it . 
- Price .

695
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:15,866
The price of couture 
starts at eight thousand ...

696
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,933
and can reach 
200 , 300 , 400 000 euros .

697
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:20,233
Depends on the parts .

698
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:24,533
I did it all to 
right and I was fine.

699
00:51:24,766 --> 00:51:27,500
Why not feel good 
and desired again?

700
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:31,066
And since 
I started worshiping fashion .

701
00:51:32,533 --> 00:51:34,633
It was like a secret desire .

702
00:51:35,066 --> 00:51:37,733
That is beautiful . 
What do you think ?

703
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,966
Being a performance artist 
in the 70 , 80 was to be poor .

704
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:45,933
Point . End point .

705
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,966
Goodbye ...

706
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:50,800
extremes.

707
00:51:54,633 --> 00:51:58,700
After we parted , 
she was working in theater .

708
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,466
There was money in it .

709
00:52:04,533 --> 00:52:05,500
Goodbye ...

710
00:52:06,466 --> 00:52:07,400
Ulay .

711
00:52:10,766 --> 00:52:14,666
The new jobs have it 
a very formalist aesthetics.

712
00:52:18,533 --> 00:52:21,500
She had entered 
in the theater world .

713
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,700
Everything was on stage .

714
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:26,966
With a theatrical flair .

715
00:52:32,133 --> 00:52:36,500
Marina is an artist 
more theatrical, emotional ...

716
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:39,500
much more dramatic ...

717
00:52:40,266 --> 00:52:42,233
than this display shows .

718
00:52:46,066 --> 00:52:49,133
The only risk 
exhibit at MoMA ...

719
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:54,366
how theatrical she will 
be able to .

720
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,733
Marina always say 
there is a difference .

721
00:52:58,766 --> 00:53:01,900
In performance , 
there is a knife and the blood is your own.

722
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:05,700
When you enacts , 
is ketchup and you do not cut yourself .

723
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,600
If we lose this 
view in the MoMA ...

724
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,766
if it is only a fake knife 
and ketchup , then fail .

725
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:24,533
TWO WEEKS BEFORE 
DISPLAY AT MoMA

726
00:53:24,566 --> 00:53:26,533
I'm in bed for six days .

727
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,900
Only bed .

728
00:53:32,966 --> 00:53:36,800
Damn, damn, damn . 
Do not get out of bed for six days.

729
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:42,500
I was so desperate 
I took everything they gave me.

730
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:46,833
Then I discovered that this syrup 
have codeine. He's incredible .

731
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:50,233
Never use drugs , 
but the codeine makes us happy.

732
00:53:50,766 --> 00:53:55,566
I slept like a baby all night 
yesterday with a smile .

733
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:57,633
Like an idiot .

734
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,600
And here I am .

735
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:03,700
Red is good 
because it gives us strength.

736
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:09,500
So if I have everything red 
linens , scarf , pajamas , oranges ...

737
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,366
maybe I will get well soon .

738
00:54:16,966 --> 00:54:18,366
This was my monologue .

739
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,700
FIVE DAYS BEFORE 
DISPLAY AT MoMA

740
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:33,133
- How do you feel today ? 
- I feel really bad .

741
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,300
I'm terrified . 
Nothing .

742
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,666
We are all getting ready . 
Marina can see a projection ?

743
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:45,366
Let me see a projection . 
Any.

744
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:49,833
We have no electricity . 
There's no way to connect the devices .

745
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,766
Nor have projectors . 
Sorry . Not yet .

746
00:54:54,866 --> 00:54:56,500
There is nothing ! Nothing !

747
00:54:57,166 --> 00:55:00,700
Five days before display 
and it seems that there will be no display .

748
00:55:01,233 --> 00:55:04,066
What makes me most 
is nervous that room .

749
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:06,700
The walls 
are not in place.

750
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:11,066
We can start the test ? 
This is important .

751
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,300
We can get them there ? 
Come .

752
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:14,300
How are you ?

753
00:55:15,066 --> 00:55:16,033
As well .

754
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:17,633
Come .

755
00:55:19,366 --> 00:55:22,633
Let us sit two 
seconds. I want to see everyone.

756
00:55:33,366 --> 00:55:36,733
This is so different 
our workshop in the field.

757
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:41,866
This is hell. And it is important to 
be honest about all this ...

758
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,933
because I can not pretend 
I'm calm . I'm not .

759
00:55:45,066 --> 00:55:49,466
And did not even have contact 
staff with any of you.

760
00:55:49,533 --> 00:55:52,033
I have to trust 
my life to you ...

761
00:55:52,133 --> 00:55:54,766
within three months of the exhibition . 
There is no other way .

762
00:55:54,866 --> 00:55:56,300
Because I have to ...

763
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,833
I need my energy 
to do my part ...

764
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:02,966
knowing that is 
that's fine with the rest .

765
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,866
Thanks for coming 
MoMA tonight .

766
00:56:14,066 --> 00:56:17,500
I am the curator of the retrospective 
Marina Abramovic .

767
00:56:18,233 --> 00:56:20,733
And I'd like 
to present Marina .

768
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,533
Thank you, Marina .

769
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,600
Let's open mic 
for questions .

770
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,100
It's the last chance to ask 
something to her directly ...

771
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,166
or will have to wait until June .

772
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,400
It's so late , we hear 
Three good questions .

773
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,100
- And at least one personal . 
- How would we know that?

774
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,900
Question guys. 
You look happy . You ?

775
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,333
It depends .

776
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:05,833
What can I say ? 
I am very happy ...

777
00:57:05,933 --> 00:57:08,900
because I'm alone . 
With whom I could live ...

778
00:57:09,033 --> 00:57:13,133
and do it for three months ? 
No stay with me .

779
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,966
I am living 
as a military training ...

780
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:21,633
I am fully concentrated 
this work three months .

781
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:24,566
Sounds simple , 
I 'm in the lounge ...

782
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,966
a sitting position . 
Not so .

783
00:57:28,066 --> 00:57:31,666
It's very difficult because you 
have to be like a stone .

784
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,733
I want to create a stillness 
in the middle of hell .

785
00:57:36,366 --> 00:57:39,666


786
00:57:39,766 --> 00:57:43,933


787
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:46,400


788
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:49,900


789
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,066


790
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,666


791
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,500


792
00:58:01,033 --> 00:58:02,800


793
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,933


794
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:08,700


795
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,533


796
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,500


797
00:58:15,566 --> 00:58:18,533


798
00:58:26,266 --> 00:58:29,000


799
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:31,733


800
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,400


801
00:58:41,533 --> 00:58:44,800


802
00:58:44,933 --> 00:58:48,500


803
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:54,633


804
00:58:54,966 --> 00:58:56,500


805
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,766


806
00:59:07,166 --> 00:59:11,833


807
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:15,666


808
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,933


809
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,900


810
00:59:26,033 --> 00:59:29,300


811
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:32,566


812
00:59:36,366 --> 00:59:37,333


813
00:59:38,466 --> 00:59:39,400


814
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,700

00:59:42,966 --> 00:59:43,933
Thank you.

816
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,366
Thank you.

817
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,100


818
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,566


819
01:00:45,766 --> 01:00:46,966


820
01:00:47,666 --> 01:00:48,633


821
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,666


822
01:01:19,666 --> 01:01:21,200


823
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:53,633


824
01:05:14,666 --> 01:05:18,166


825
01:05:19,133 --> 01:05:22,200


826
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,766


827
01:07:21,766 --> 01:07:24,933


828
01:07:25,033 --> 01:07:28,866


829
01:07:29,033 --> 01:07:31,800


830
01:07:31,866 --> 01:07:33,833


831
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:38,333


832
01:07:38,533 --> 01:07:40,833


833
01:07:40,966 --> 01:07:45,500


834
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:50,500


835
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:54,200


836
01:07:54,466 --> 01:07:58,100


837
01:07:58,266 --> 01:08:01,500


838
01:08:01,533 --> 01:08:04,200


839
01:08:04,466 --> 01:08:05,533


840
01:08:09,666 --> 01:08:10,633
Let's go .

841
01:08:12,366 --> 01:08:14,500


842
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,233


843
01:08:16,366 --> 01:08:19,600


844
01:08:19,733 --> 01:08:21,700


845
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,866


846
01:08:36,666 --> 01:08:37,633


847
01:09:45,066 --> 01:09:49,000


848
01:09:49,233 --> 01:09:51,200


849
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:54,233


850
01:09:54,366 --> 01:09:56,333


851
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:00,066


852
01:10:00,933 --> 01:10:05,666


853
01:10:05,766 --> 01:10:09,800


854
01:10:09,933 --> 01:10:14,166


855
01:10:14,233 --> 01:10:17,766


856
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:19,000


857
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,900


858
01:10:24,933 --> 01:10:25,900


859
01:10:27,633 --> 01:10:29,933


860
01:10:30,166 --> 01:10:35,166


861
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:37,633

01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:56,100


863
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:01,400


864
01:11:01,533 --> 01:11:04,566


865
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,800


866
01:11:10,033 --> 01:11:14,300


867
01:11:14,966 --> 01:11:17,266


868
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:28,366


869
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:31,366


870
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,800


871
01:11:36,866 --> 01:11:39,100


872
01:11:43,233 --> 01:11:47,966


873
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:53,300


874
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,800


875
01:12:05,966 --> 01:12:09,500


876
01:12:40,966 --> 01:12:44,700


877
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:49,266


878
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,000


879
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,266


880
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:04,466


881
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,733


882
01:13:08,933 --> 01:13:12,533


883
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:15,033


884
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,166


885
01:13:32,733 --> 01:13:35,266


886
01:13:37,566 --> 01:13:41,266


887
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:48,333


888
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,300


889
01:13:55,033 --> 01:13:59,200


890
01:14:03,166 --> 01:14:06,466


891
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,500


892
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:17,000


893
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:30,866


894
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:35,500


895
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:40,166
Thank you .

896
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,566
Thank you.

897
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:48,666


898
01:15:48,766 --> 01:15:49,733


899
01:15:49,766 --> 01:15:52,700


900
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:55,333


901
01:15:55,366 --> 01:15:57,733


902
01:15:57,766 --> 01:16:00,666


903
01:16:01,133 --> 01:16:04,400


904
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:08,666
Okay ?

905
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,900
Wait .

906
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,566


907
01:16:17,733 --> 01:16:18,733


908
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,333


909
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:00,400


910
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,366
Wow !

911
01:17:18,466 --> 01:17:21,166


912
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,233


913
01:17:24,566 --> 01:17:29,033


914
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,333


915
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,266
I do not know .

916
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:35,700
Today ?

917
01:17:36,566 --> 01:17:38,100


918
01:17:38,233 --> 01:17:41,933


919
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:46,000


920
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,166


921
01:17:48,966 --> 01:17:51,500


922
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:54,300


923
01:17:54,966 --> 01:17:56,266


924
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:01,800


925
01:18:01,933 --> 01:18:06,933


926
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,033


927
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:40,933


928
01:18:42,033 --> 01:18:46,833


929
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,066


930
01:18:56,233 --> 01:19:00,166


931
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:07,166


932
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:12,866


933
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,100


934
01:19:22,233 --> 01:19:23,866


935
01:19:49,366 --> 01:19:51,666


936
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,000


937
01:20:03,733 --> 01:20:07,500


938
01:20:09,533 --> 01:20:13,500


939
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:16,300


940
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,966


941
01:21:58,666 --> 01:22:01,033


942
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:07,000


943
01:22:08,733 --> 01:22:09,733
It's nothing.

944
01:22:10,366 --> 01:22:13,533


945
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,633


946
01:22:27,733 --> 01:22:29,800


947
01:22:29,933 --> 01:22:34,833


948
01:22:35,466 --> 01:22:36,533


949
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,933


950
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:47,500


951
01:22:47,733 --> 01:22:50,500
The difference is that there is 
a blockage between them ...

952
01:22:50,533 --> 01:22:52,700
from the viewpoint 
security.

953
01:22:53,133 --> 01:22:54,866
If someone does something ...

954
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:58,166
there is nothing preventing 
someone to do something .

955
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:01,833
That's what I think . 
But instruct the public ...

956
01:23:02,033 --> 01:23:06,866
which to sit , no one can 
move, tap on it , nothing .

957
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:14,000
She becomes more vulnerable . 
It is much more straightforward.

958
01:23:14,133 --> 01:23:18,366
There is no obstacle between it 
and the public . She was right .

959
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,500
Fathers do not need the cross.

960
01:23:28,766 --> 01:23:29,733
MAY

961
01:23:48,966 --> 01:23:49,933
Nine , December

962
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,133
Three , two, one .

963
01:24:52,533 --> 01:24:54,833
- Show me your numbers . 
- What's that ?

964
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:58,466
This is the number system 
Marina Abramovic .

965
01:25:00,866 --> 01:25:04,566
- We're almost done . 
- You said that in April too.

966
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:10,133
This is detail . Do not 
can grab a few minutes here and there .

967
01:25:10,866 --> 01:25:11,866
A few minutes ?

968
01:25:12,466 --> 01:25:14,900
What's more 
a month, year , or week.

969
01:25:14,933 --> 01:25:15,900
You rascal !

970
01:25:17,266 --> 01:25:19,766
- Do not cling to ... 
- Details .

971
01:25:20,333 --> 01:25:23,166
- Think big . 
- Yes , think big .

972
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:25,133
That's it.

973
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:32,666
- I'm fine . 
- Okay ?

974
01:25:36,633 --> 01:25:40,333
The museum is open . 
Come on, please! Come on !

975
01:25:50,733 --> 01:25:53,500
- I'm number five . 
- She's five , I 'm four .

976
01:25:56,366 --> 01:25:57,333
One, two ...

977
01:25:57,833 --> 01:25:58,800
three .

978
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:09,566
Stood in line several days 
and could not enter.

979
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,266
You stood in queue ? When?

980
01:26:12,366 --> 01:26:15,466
I arrived yesterday at 5pm , 
but I could not .

981
01:26:16,533 --> 01:26:17,500
It is very ...

982
01:26:18,966 --> 01:26:21,133
Now in the end 
is very competitive .

983
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:29,233
People camp 
all night and expect.

984
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:32,066
It reminds me 
the issue of celebrity ...

985
01:26:32,333 --> 01:26:34,200
Star performance .

986
01:26:35,733 --> 01:26:37,500
It is a matter of fans .

987
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:41,300
What is very interesting 
in her work ...

988
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,133
is the aspect of screen 
blank .

989
01:26:44,566 --> 01:26:47,533
What causes in all 
in the art world ...

990
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:51,233
those who say 
know the work very well ...

991
01:26:51,366 --> 01:26:54,633
forming part of 
vocabulary of the language ...

992
01:26:54,966 --> 01:26:56,700
and strangers too .

993
01:26:57,033 --> 01:26:59,866
People who ask : 
\" Why does she do that? \"

994
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:04,200
And this is interesting because 
we also ...

995
01:27:04,733 --> 01:27:07,133
these giant screens 
projections .

996
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:52,833
Connecting Marina 
with the public ...

997
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:58,633
comes this emptiness she feels , 
or felt as a child .

998
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:05,700
She wants to be loved , 
be needed .

999
01:28:16,633 --> 01:28:18,600
Marina has the feel ...

1000
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,100
you need the public ...

1001
01:28:23,533 --> 01:28:25,166
like the air to breathe .

1002
01:28:28,133 --> 01:28:29,866
That's the fuel it.

1003
01:28:31,733 --> 01:28:34,133
She lives for her art , 
to the public.

1004
01:28:38,066 --> 01:28:39,400
When I met her ...

1005
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,200
I thought , \"Wow , she is 
in love with me . \"

1006
01:28:43,766 --> 01:28:45,400
And it took me a while ...

1007
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,233
to understand that she is 
in love with the world.

1008
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:51,400
It is not personal .

1009
01:28:51,733 --> 01:28:54,700
\"I do not think it's personal 
'm in love with the world ...

1010
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,000
not only for you. \"

1011
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,866
I realized she 
is repeating it ...

1012
01:29:00,966 --> 01:29:03,600
with each 
of the people in the hall .

1013
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,166
All right , Mom?

1014
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:31,400
- What happened 
- I'm well proud of you .

1015
01:29:36,266 --> 01:29:38,233
I do not know if the public 
idolizes me .

1016
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,100
Belongs to him how to design it , 
but it's not my goal .

1017
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:46,800
If you get a 
point of his career ...

1018
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,400
who is idolized , 
has money and fame ...

1019
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:53,900
this is not the goal of art , 
is only a side effect .

1020
01:29:56,733 --> 01:30:00,666
It is an extra product . 
And I love the extra product.

1021
01:30:11,266 --> 01:30:14,466
There are people around, 
you know it ...

1022
01:30:16,366 --> 01:30:19,400
but the connection with Marina 
is so strong it does not matter.

1023
01:30:19,466 --> 01:30:22,166
- Erases all the rest . 
- She is acting ?

1024
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:25,233
If you say no . 
Who is acting ...

1025
01:30:27,733 --> 01:30:30,600
the only similarity is 
that there are people watching .

1026
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,200
The sacrifice 
a performance ...

1027
01:30:33,233 --> 01:30:35,500
seems always to 
based on performance .

1028
01:30:35,535 --> 01:30:37,233
- Maybe . 
- Are you an actor ?

1029
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:41,400
Do you feel this presence .

1030
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:47,966
Attention, please. 
The museum is closed .

1031
01:30:48,733 --> 01:30:53,000
Please return units 
audio reception.

1032
01:31:13,033 --> 01:31:14,666
Tunji knew told me ...

1033
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,066
that 750 000 people 
saw the display ?

1034
01:31:18,933 --> 01:31:20,266
It's almost a million .

1035
01:31:22,766 --> 01:31:26,800
We must extend one more 
month terms to one million .

1036
01:31:33,166 --> 01:31:35,766
Let's go . That's the cook ?

1037
01:31:37,466 --> 01:31:38,733
He is a genius .

1038
01:31:42,133 --> 01:31:44,866
Who was that 
asian ?

1039
01:31:46,833 --> 01:31:48,133
You like it?

1040
01:31:49,133 --> 01:31:51,333
We can take 
the phone number ?

1041
01:31:51,533 --> 01:31:53,400
He was cool. Sexy .

1042
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,000
We're almost done .

1043
01:31:59,733 --> 01:32:02,866
After seeing the exhibition 
Marina for the first time ...

1044
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,366
I was inspired to do 
my own art performance .

1045
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,200
Create one . Staying here 
is a presentation ...

1046
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:14,566
devote so much 
commitment to it .

1047
01:32:15,766 --> 01:32:16,866
The LAST DAY

1048
01:32:17,566 --> 01:32:18,666
Got there .

1049
01:32:19,533 --> 01:32:20,500
Almost there .

1050
01:32:22,866 --> 01:32:26,566
Next Saturday I will be 
in the field. What will be too .

1051
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,500
I wanted to have a number, 
but I'm not .

1052
01:32:31,933 --> 01:32:34,666
Came from Australia to 
sit with Marina .

1053
01:32:34,733 --> 01:32:35,866
It takes number ?

1054
01:32:42,733 --> 01:32:44,700
I am sad and happy .

1055
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,166
Marina , we are going 
on the street for 53 you see the queue ...

1056
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:57,500
the last time.

1057
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:00,400
They arrived on Wednesday 
or Thursday night .

1058
01:33:00,466 --> 01:33:04,966
One girl had the idea 
come around 22h .

1059
01:33:06,066 --> 01:33:07,033
Wow !

1060
01:33:07,266 --> 01:33:10,500
And from then on , 
people do not go away .

1061
01:33:10,566 --> 01:33:12,400
They are seated .

1062
01:33:12,733 --> 01:33:15,600
Leave the museum and sit 
on the door until morning .

1063
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:36,833
My God , this is amazing . 
This is the last day .

1064
01:33:37,066 --> 01:33:39,900
I guess nobody 
imagined it .

1065
01:33:40,333 --> 01:33:41,333
What time is it ?

1066
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:43,733
Are 10h13 . Ten and fifteen .

1067
01:33:43,933 --> 01:33:46,333
- We go to the chairs ? 
- Sure .

1068
01:33:46,466 --> 01:33:48,966
Already planned . 
I know what to do .

1069
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,133
We will do intervals 
15 minutes .

1070
01:33:52,566 --> 01:33:57,366
You tap on the shoulder of the person 
and says the time is up .

1071
01:33:57,900 --> 01:34:00,333
The museum only opens at 10:30 am ...

1072
01:34:00,366 --> 01:34:02,500
but let

1073
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,500
Who will not sit 
Marina before ...

1074
01:34:05,633 --> 01:34:08,133
not one now. 
Wait until the museum open .

1075
01:34:43,533 --> 01:34:47,366
Sitting with Marina

1076
01:34:47,566 --> 01:34:49,633
You expect 
become ?

1077
01:34:50,566 --> 01:34:54,833
No, when I first 
time , I decided to try ...

1078
01:34:55,166 --> 01:34:57,233
and then it happened.

1079
01:35:29,866 --> 01:35:30,866
Take it from there .

1080
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:40,000
\" We came to sit with Marina , 
the whore of Babylon ...

1081
01:35:40,133 --> 01:35:45,500
and confess . Superfluous speech 
pure form against pure form ...

1082
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:48,733
reflection of the empty 
full value .

1083
01:35:49,066 --> 01:35:53,000
We came to the last 
spectators before the crucifixion .

1084
01:35:53,333 --> 01:35:56,166
Sat as apostles 
at her table ...

1085
01:35:56,366 --> 01:35:59,000
and our indifference betrays . \"

1086
01:36:01,366 --> 01:36:03,633
It seems like a 
matter of time ...

1087
01:36:03,666 --> 01:36:07,266
when to throw in the face 
someone is art .

1088
01:36:10,666 --> 01:36:13,366
You will sit in front 
of the artist in silence.

1089
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,233
There will be no distractions 
somehow .

1090
01:36:16,366 --> 01:36:19,600
No gesture , speak , 
do not touch hands .

1091
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:21,533
What happened ? Okay ?

1092
01:36:21,566 --> 01:36:24,300
- Are you nervous ? 
- I've been waiting 16 hours .

1093
01:36:24,466 --> 01:36:27,366
Your time is coming . 
I 'll let you know . Thank you .

1094
01:37:21,966 --> 01:37:24,100
Send the next 
sit , please.

1095
01:37:24,133 --> 01:37:25,766
- We will . 
- I 'm next .

1096
01:37:25,866 --> 01:37:26,866
I know, I know .

1097
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:30,166
The performance 
must continue.

1098
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:33,600
- We expect Tunji . 
- Really? We must continue .

1099
01:38:33,833 --> 01:38:36,200
I hope 
back upstairs.

1100
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:38,633
Do not know if you 
should shoot me .

1101
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:43,466
I'd love to sit down 
before her.

1102
01:38:43,533 --> 01:38:45,933
I did not realize 
that there were rules .

1103
01:38:46,166 --> 01:38:48,900
I would have obeyed 
if I knew .

1104
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,066
But I wanted 
to be spontaneous.

1105
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:55,833
What no one knew , 
that was something special with her .

1106
01:38:55,866 --> 01:38:58,500
And I thought that 
Square ...

1107
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,600
the public do 
art piece.

1108
01:39:02,166 --> 01:39:05,333
And I wanted to be 
vulnerable to it ...

1109
01:39:05,533 --> 01:39:07,600
as it is for everyone.

1110
01:39:13,566 --> 01:39:17,166
I think this display 
is a self-portrait . It's her .

1111
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:19,700
She sits and delivery .

1112
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,066
She always talks 
the here and now ...

1113
01:39:27,033 --> 01:39:28,133
but this piece ...

1114
01:39:28,766 --> 01:39:31,600
Marina Abramovic call : 
The Artist is Present ...

1115
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:32,800
is a self-portrait .

1116
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:42,766
She created a space 
charismatic ...

1117
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:46,033
a rent 
the fabric of the universe ...

1118
01:39:46,166 --> 01:39:48,666
it was just her, 
she occupied .

1119
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:53,500
And she did it in a room 
full of many people .

1120
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,966
And many people felt 
charismatic this space ...

1121
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,733
as a reality .

1122
01:39:59,233 --> 01:40:01,333
This is an achievement 
extraordinary .
