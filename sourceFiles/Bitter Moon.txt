1
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,090
Man:
<i>I still can't believe</i>
<i>we're really on our way.</i>

2
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,860
Nor can I.

3
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,390
It's so fantastic.

4
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,190
Thank you, darling.

5
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,460
Mwah!

6
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,870
Oh, don't run away.
I won't be a sec.

7
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,360
<i>( steam whistle blowing )</i>

8
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,980
<i>( blowing continues )</i>

9
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,630
Uh, Fiona?

10
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,660
Fiona?

11
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,400
- Stay here.
- <i>Oh, blimey.</i>

12
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,630
<i>What's the matter?</i>

13
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,200
- Help me clean her up.
-  <i>Yeah.</i>

14
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,140
- There.
- Gently. There we are.

15
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,410
Up-- there we are.

16
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,510
That's better.
I'm going to clean you up.

17
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,350
Let's get...

18
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,150
wipe those tears, eh?

19
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,450
<i>( water running )</i>

20
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,190
( vomiting )

21
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,590
Oh, God.

22
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,160
Just try to take a deep breath.
Now take a deep breath.

23
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,130
You'll feel better.

24
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,930
A deep breath
and fresh air,
that's what you need.

25
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,270
Here.

26
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,100
You're very pretty.

27
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,510
Oh.

28
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,510
There we are.

29
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,380
Are you going to Istanbul?

30
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,650
Yes, then we're flying
on to Bombay.

31
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,690
<i>How far are you going?</i>

32
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,060
Oh, farther.

33
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,700
Much farther.

34
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,270
But why on earth
go to India?

35
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,440
I think-- think we need--
felt we needed a break

36
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,500
from the rat race, really.

37
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,740
And, you know,
India's got so much
to teach the West, doesn't it?

38
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,110
Really?
What, for example?

39
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,280
Well, um,
you know, inner serenity,
that kind of stuff.

40
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,480
<i>Ah!</i>
<i>The Karma-Nirvana Syndrome?</i>

41
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,320
<i>Lots of poppycock,</i>
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

42
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,190
No, India's all flies,
smells and beggars.

43
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,620
And as for serenity,
it's the noisiest place
on earth.

44
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,420
( laughs )

45
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,160
Well, if you say so,
I'm sure.

46
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,430
Now I'm sure Mr. Singh
is just being modest

47
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,200
about his own part
of the world.

48
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,660
<i>Anyway, I can't wait</i>
<i>to get there, darling.</i>

49
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,570
See,
it's my anniversary treat.

50
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,200
We've been married
for seven years.

51
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,040
<i>Ah, so it's a form</i>
<i>of marital therapy.</i>

52
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,540
Quite unnecessary, dear lady.

53
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,310
With a wife
as beautiful as yourself,

54
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,080
any man would be proof
against the seven-year itch.
What?

55
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,510
( laughs )

56
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,220
( yawns )

57
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,320
You tired, sweetheart?

58
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,250
Absolutely whacked.

59
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,590
Must be all this sea air.

60
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,220
Yeah.

61
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,520
How about a nightcap?

62
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,290
Mmm, how about bed?

63
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,590
Oh, come on, darling,
just one.

64
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,290
No, honestly not.
You go.

65
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,360
Just take me
to my cabin.

66
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,730
I'm out on my feet.

67
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,070
- Are you quite sure?
- Certain.

68
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,540
Anyway, it's bad
for an old married couple

69
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,610
to be glued together
all the time.

70
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,640

Whiskey and soda, please.

00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,680
You feeling better?

86
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,310
Better than what?

87
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,420
You remember, the--
this afternoon

88
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,150
in the-- in the loo.

89
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,620
The loo?

90
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,860
Is it your usual
pickup routine?

91
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,260
( slurping )

92
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,670
Of course I remember.

93
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,570
I have a perfect memory

94
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,740
when I feel like it.

95
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,470
Right.
( laughs )

96
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,910
What is this,
some kind of game?

97
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,510
Yeah.
Want to dance?

98
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,650
<i>Uh, well,</i>
<i>I'm not much of a dancer.</i>

99
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,650
That figures.

100
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,330
<i>( slurping )</i>

101
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,160
<i>What's your name?</i>

102
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,900
Nigel Dobson.
Hi.

103
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,740
Okay, Nigel, amuse me.

104
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,510
Say something funny.

105
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,880
Um, blimey.

106
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,610
Uh, well, you're French,
aren't you?

107
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,450
<i>I can tell</i>
<i>from your accent.</i>

108
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,450
<i>I mean, your English</i>
<i>is very, very good,</i>

109
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,320
<i>but for some reason,</i>
<i>I can always tell a Frog.</i>

110
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,190
Sorry.

111
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,560
Stupid thing to say.
Just slipped out.

112
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,390
Schoolboy expression.
Comes from working in the city.
I'm a Eurobond dealer

113
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,790
<i>and we're always</i>
<i>calling people Frogs.</i>

114
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
( snoring )

115
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,670
You're right, boring.

116
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,400
Um, but anyway, you call us--
you call us Roast Beef,
don't you?

117
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,570
<i>Rosbif!</i> I think that's
how you pronounce it, isn't it?

118
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,270
You're too funny for me,
Nigel.

119
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,480
I'm choking with laughter.

120
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,350
So long.

121
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,420
I leave you to your magnetic,
irresistible personality.

122
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,860
Man:
<i>Romantic, isn't it?</i>

123
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,700
<i>Yeah, it is,</i>
<i>splendid.</i>

124
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,270
You're Nigel, aren't you?

125
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,910
Yeah.

126
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,740
Sorry, do I know you?

127
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,420
Beware of her.

128
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,390
Right.

129
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,290
She's a walking mantrap.

130
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,930
Sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

131
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,790
Sure, you do.

132
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,500
I'm her husband.

133
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,400
Look what she did to me.

134
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,300
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,910
Let me ask you something,
Nigel.

136
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,640
You don't mind
if I call you Nigel, do you?

137
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,980
What do you think of her?

138
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,810
Well, if you mean
what I think you mean,

139
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,750
- she's very good-looking.
- <i>Good-looking?</i>

140
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,620
Yeah, sure,
all of that and more.

141
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,420
She gives you a hard-on,
doesn't she?

142
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,790
I beg your pardon?

143
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,720
Come on, Nigel,
don't be so British.

144
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,560
You'd like to fuck her.

145
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,330
Admit it,
it's no crime.

146
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,800
I've no idea
what you're driving at.

147
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,830
<i>Cut the crap.</i>

148
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,830
You're itching to know
some more about her, aren't you?

149
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,940
Well, aren't you?

150
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,670
Here.

151
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,880
Do me a favor,
would you, Nigel?

152
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,540
Help me over
the goddamn step here,
would you?

153
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,410
They don't design these boats
for my kind.

154
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,050
Yeah, sure.

155
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,720
Get inside there.

156
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,460
Grab the wheels--
the wheels.

157
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,730
Up!

158
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,760
( grunting )

159
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,830
( sighs )

160
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,070
Ah, I hate
these fucking boats.

161
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,610
It's good of you to take pity
on an obnoxious cripple.

162
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,580
I don't know you at all,
Nigel,

163
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,520
but somehow I have the feeling
that you're exactly the listener

164
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,720
that I've been looking for.

165
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,360
I hope you'll find
my story interesting.

166
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,530
I realize it's hard
to relate to something

167
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,860
that doesn't concern you.

168
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,530
But maybe it already does.

169
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,740
We have the place
to ourselves.

170
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,010
Mimi has her own cabin.

171
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,930
Yeah.

172
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,830
Eternity for me began
one fall day in Paris

173
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,970
aboard the 96 bus,
which shuttles

174
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,770
between Montparnasse
and Porte des Lilas.

175
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,980
( speaking French )

176
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,020
<i>Mademoiselle?</i>

177
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
<i>Madame?</i>

178
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,240
<i>Merci.</i>

179
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,520

Not if you know
what you're doing.

378
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,440
Why don't you use
an electric?

379
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,840
Americans like
electric things.

380
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,010
Ha.
Not this American.

381
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,280
I know.

382
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,050
It makes you feel macho.

383
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,880
Yeah.

384
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,350
You're a real tiger.

385
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,890
( laughs )

386
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,950
( laughs )
You think you're Hemingway.

387
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,060
Hemingway had a beard.

388
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,460
Let me try.

389
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,690
No way, no way.
I value my hide.

390
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,400
- Please.
- No.

391
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,200
Please, please,
just one little try.

392
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,700
( laughs )
Now who can refuse you
anything?

393
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,270
Eh eh, like this.

394
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,440
No, nuh-uh. Yeah.

395
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,250
Not too much of an angle.

396
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:45,380
Uh-huh.

397
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,150
Uh-huh.

398
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,190
( gasps ) Ah.

399
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,960
Oscar:
<i>Her pussy was a neat,</i>
<i>discreet little cleft.</i>

400
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,030
<i>But as soon as</i>
<i>the animal within was roused</i>
<i>by my caresses,</i>

401
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,930
<i>it would stir,</i>

402
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:36,300
draw aside the silken curtain
covering its lair

403
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,940
and become
a carnivorous flower.

404
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,170
A baby's mouth
greedily sucking my finger.

405
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,840
<i>I loved to tease her clitoris</i>
<i>with the tip of my tongue</i>

406
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,550
<i>and then abandon it</i>

407
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,250
wet and glistening,

408
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,450
like a little duck
dabbling in a pool
of pink flesh.

409
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,850
Right.

410
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,160
Nigel, come on.
Don't look so shocked.

411
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,790
Eh.

412
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,960
Steady on, old boy.
( laughs )

413
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,330
I'm only going
into such detail

414
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,270
to show you
how completely enslaved I was,

415
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,070
body and soul,
by this creature

416
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,570
whose dangerous charms
have made such an impression
on you.

417
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,910
I-- why--
why do you keep saying that?

418
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,880
You mean I'm mistaken?
Oh, all right.

419
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,450
I'll let it go.
Leave me with my memories.

420
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,850
No, I mean--

421
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,920
if in some way it helps you
to get it off your chest
or something--

422
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,360
What a compassionate fellow
you are, Nigel.

423
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,860
Actually, I-- to tell the truth,
I should be going.

424
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,230
My wife will think
I've fallen overboard.

425
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,230
<i>You know, you'd have made</i>
<i>a very good analyst.</i>

426
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:42,470
<i>Not many men would have</i>
<i>listened to so much</i>
<i>for so long.</i>

427
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,470
( chuckles )
Yeah.

428
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,570
Well, anyway,
thanks for the drink.

429
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,000
( door creaking )

430
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,330
What I can't understand
is why he'd think you'd
be interested

431
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,030
in all these sordid details.

432
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,030
I haven't a clue.

433
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,330
He probably lets his hair down
every time he corners
a captive audience.

434
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,970
Poor chap.

435
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,570
Poor chap?
He's a verbal exhibitionist.

436
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,510
- Right.
- It's his wife
I feel sorry for.

437
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,040
Yeah.

438
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,010
Did I mention I met her
in the bar last night?

439
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,610
- No.
- No, I didn't, did I?

440
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,350
Was she feeling better?

441
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,010
Yeah, much better.
Much better.

442
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,120
She's not bad-looking,
actually.

443
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,250
Thank you.

444
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,690
They're coming.

445
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,160
What?

446
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,060
Your American friend
and his wife.

447
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,160
Nigel.

448
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,360
Oh.

449
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
Just as long as he doesn't
park himself on us.

450
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,530
After what
he told you last night?
He wouldn't dare,

451
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,570
- would he?
- Nigel, old chap.

452
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,000
Good to see you.

453
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,210
<i>This must be</i>
<i>your lovely wife.</i>

454
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,640
Hi there,
I'm Oscar.

455
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,340
Mimi you already know,
don't you?

456
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,280
- Hi.
- Hello.

457
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,550
- <i>So do you, Nigel, right?</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm, yeah. Hello.</i>

458
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,580
Look, I hate to break up
a twosome,

459
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,350
but would you mind
if I joined you?

460
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,690
<i>We had an invitation</i>
<i>to the captain's table.</i>

461
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,620
<i>Trouble is,</i>
<i>I'm allergic to beards.</i>

462
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,160
<i>Are you allergic to cripples?</i>

463
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,090
Oh!

464
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,560
Well, after an intro like that,
how could we refuse?

465
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,200
Fine, it's settled, then.

466
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,460
Off you go, baby.

467
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,030
Thanks.
Have fun.

468
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,100
Mmm. Mimi doesn't share
my aversion.

469
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,170
In fact, she's not too choosy
in general.

470
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,410
<i>Can't be.</i>
<i>She couldn't have married me.</i>

471
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,580
<i>What a girl.</i>

472
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,280
Knocking 'em dead
as usual.

473
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,250
( chuckling )

474
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,650
Just wine for me, white.

475
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,190
Anything as long
as it's not retsina.

476
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:18,120
Yes, Mimi's very lovely.

477
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,590
But you-- I still don't know
your name, by the way.

478
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,060
Fiona.

479
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,200
Fiona. I hope you won't
think me forward,

480
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,330
but I find your own brand
of beauty more subtle.

481
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,530
It has that inimitably
British quality--

482
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:33,470
a kind of reticence that hints
at untapped potentiality.

483
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,370
- ( laughs )
- French Chablis, sir.

484
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,440
Nigel's been tapping
my potentialities for years.
Haven't you, Nigel?

485
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,010
Well, Nigel?

486
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,220
Well, come on,
your lovely wife
has just implied

487
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,550
that she's lost
all her mystery for you.

488
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,420
True or false?

489
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,420
No, I mean, I think there's
probably a corner of everyone

490
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,460
that remains to be explored.

491
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,360
Halfhearted,
but better than nothing.

492
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,130
Well, Fiona,

493
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:03,430
<i>He's right, though.</i>
<i>Everyone has secret nooks</i>
<i>and crannies.</i>

494
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,570
Every relationship,
no matter how harmonious,

495
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:08,340
contains seeds of farce,
tragedy.

496
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,280
Mmm.

497
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,080
I do not like the look
of that sky much.

498
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,050
I hope the weather's
going to hold.

499
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:21,320
Jesus, don't tell me
you're taking refuge
in the weather.

500
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,420
You know what I hope?

501
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,720
I hope the ship goes down
and we're all marooned
on a desert island.

502
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,730
<i>I'd wind up</i>
<i>the sole survivor.</i>

503
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,300
That's charming.
And why do you say that?

504
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,430
Because no one would be
tempted to cannibalize
my shriveled carcass.

505
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,530
<i>( Oscar laughing )</i>

506
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,490
I hope he hasn't
been boring you.

507
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,820
No, not at all.

508
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,160
Your husband
has a great sense of humor.

509
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,590
<i>Black humor,</i>
<i>but still, he's been keeping us</i>
<i>thoroughly entertained.</i>

510
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,330
- Oscar: <i>See, baby?</i>
<i>- Mimi:</i> <i>See what?</i>

511
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,330
<i>Our British friends</i>
<i>find me entertaining.</i>

512
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,200
In small doses, perhaps.

513
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,270
But now we must
leave them in peace.

514
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,570
Ah, indeed.

515
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,310
Thanks for taking care
of him.

516
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,810
Fiona:
<i>Not at all.</i>

517
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,140
Ah, Fiona,

518
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,680
I've already imposed on you,
but may I beg a favor?

519
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,320
As I'm sure he told you,

520
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,580
Nigel and I had a chat
last night.

521
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,850
I found him
such stimulating company.

522
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,160
Could I borrow him again
this afternoon?

523
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,320
<i>Just for an hour or so?</i>

524
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,760
Well, he's quite grown up.
He doesn't have to have
mommy's permission.

525
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,460
( laughs )

526
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,760
Ta.

527
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,340
Oscar:
<i>The seasons came and went.</i>

528
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,880
<i>Mimi's face still held</i>
<i>a thousand mysteries for me,</i>

529
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,550
<i>her body</i>
<i>a thousand sweet promises.</i>

530
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,250
<i>But lurking at the back</i>
<i>of my mind</i>

531
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,850
<i>was an unspoken fear</i>
<i>that we'd already scaled</i>

532
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,190
<i>the heights</i>
<i>of our relationship.</i>

533
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,560
<i>It would all be downhill</i>
<i>from now on.</i>

534
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,890
<i>And then something happened.</i>

535
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,700
Something that would put things
on a totally different plane.

536
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,170
We were at Kitzbühel.

537
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,740
Skiing vacation.

538
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,180
<i>I'd rented</i>
<i>a chalet there.</i>

539
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,810
<i>It was one of those nights,</i>
<i>warm and cozy inside,</i>

540
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:32,820
great fat snowflakes
drifting down in the blackness

541
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,690
beyond the frosted panes,

542
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,820
no light
but the glow from the set,

543
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,530
Mimi on the floor wearing
a T-shirt and nothing else,

544
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:45,660
watching some old American soap
dubbed in German,

545
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,530
and me on the couch
watching her,

546
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,740
<i>sprawled in a sort</i>
<i>of boozy stupor.</i>

547
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,600
<i>All at once,</i>
<i>she got up,</i>

548
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:56,970
stalked over
to the set,

549
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:01,210
spread her legs,

550
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:05,620
and pissed on the screen
like she wanted to blot it out.

551
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,290
<i>Time stood still</i>
<i>for an instant.</i>

552
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:09,990
<i>Then I rolled</i>
<i>off the couch.</i>

553
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,460
I crawled over
like a lunatic.

554
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,430
I wormed my way
between her legs

555
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,960
and I turned over.

556
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,500
And right away,
I was engulfed with this warm,

557
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,900
golden cascade.

558
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,300
It spattered my cheeks,
it filled my nostrils,

559
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,910
it stung my eyes.

560
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:32,540
<i>And then something</i>
<i>jolted my brain</i>

561
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,350
<i>with multi-megavolt</i>
<i>intensity.</i>

562
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:39,820
There was this blinding flash
in the back of my eyeballs.

563
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,890
I experienced
the orgasm of a lifetime.

564
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,690
For God's sake, man.

565
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,330
It was like a white-hot blade
piercing me through and through.

566
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,030
This was my Nile,
my Ganges, my Jordan,

567
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,670
my fountain of youth,
my second baptism.

568
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,770
Look, I think I'm probably
as broad-minded as the next man,

569
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,300
but, I mean, honestly,
there are limits.

570
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,940
Stop twittering, Nigel.

571
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,980
I'm sharing a revelation
with you, damn it.

572
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,010
I'm trying to expand
your sexual horizons.

573
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,910
Oh, I see.

they need expanding?

574
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,620
I'm sure your tumbles
with Fiona

575
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,420

576
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,750
Very sanitary and hygienic
in their way.

577
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,820
You bloody well
leave us out of this.

578
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,290
I mean,
at least we've got some decency.

579
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,330
What do you think
you're doing,

580
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:28,370
sharing the details
of your perverted sex life
with a total stranger?

581
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,730
It's just downright obscene.

582
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,810
Have you ever felt
real overpowering passion?

583
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:37,010
Have you ever truly
idolized a woman?

584
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,080
Nothing can be obscene
in such a love.

585
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,750
Everything that occurs
between you becomes a sacrament.

<i>So, anyway,</i>

591
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,860
that was our sexual Rubicon.

592
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:05,500
It opened up
all sorts of new possibilities.

00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,290
Not ever!

696
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:42,530
( sobbing )
I love you.

697
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:44,530
I love you.

698
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,460
Oscar:
<i>I loved her too.</i>

699
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,830
<i>But our credit</i>
<i>was running out.</i>

700
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:51,540
<i>We were headed</i>
<i>for sexual bankruptcy.</i>

701
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:57,440
<i>( rooster crowing )</i>

702
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,940
<i>( farm animals making noise )</i>

703
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,850
( sniffing )

704
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:07,580
Mmm, I smell pig.

705
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,320
( laughing )

706
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,460
- Oscar: <i>Don't laugh.</i>
<i>- Don't talk.</i>

707
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,590
Come, piggy!

708
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,200
Where is he?

709
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,230
Come, piggy wiggy.

710
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:28,840
Where are you?

711
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,540
( laughs )

712
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,320
- Get off! Get off!
- ( grunting )

713
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:46,190
How dare you try
to fuck me, you filthy beast?

714
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:49,560
- Take that.
- ( grunting )

715
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:56,170
- Oscar: Harder.
- Shut up.

716
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:58,130
- Harder.
- Shut up!

717
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,340
Aw, you spoiled it.

718
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,140
Pigs don't talk.

719
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,040
How can I believe
in a pig that talks?

720
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:10,180
<i>( rooster crows )</i>

721
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,490
You know something?

722
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:19,590
I don't believe
in it either.

723
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:22,160
Not anymore.

724
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:31,530
That was it.

725
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,170
The spell was broken at last.

726
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,610
Nigel:
<i>Ah, jolly good thing too,</i>
<i>if you ask me.</i>

727
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:39,310
Hate to think
what you'd be up to next.

728
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:42,180
<i>Don't worry, Nigel.</i>
<i>There's plenty more to tell.</i>

729
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,680
What makes you think
I want to hear it?

730
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,050
I still don't know
what gives you the idea

731
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,650
that I enjoy being used
as a rubbish dump

732
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,250
for your unsavory
reminiscences.

733
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,490
Don't you?

734
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:54,190
Don't you really, Nigel?

735
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:58,460
( laughs )

736
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,930
He's still here?

737
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:01,970
Yeah, I'm afraid I am,
yes.

738
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,500
But I'm just off now.

739
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:08,970
You know, Nigel has been
extremely patient with me.

740
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:12,940
We don't see eye to eye
on everything,

741
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:16,210
but we share
at least one interest in common.

742
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:18,150
You, baby.

743
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:21,690
<i>I suppose that's why he keeps</i>
<i>coming back for more.</i>

744
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,150
( laughs )

745
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,590
Anyway, as I say,
I'm just off.

746
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,960
So thanks very much
for the tea.

747
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,330
<i>Toodle-oo.</i>

748
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:30,730
Bye.

749
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,100
<i>( Mimi laughing )</i>

750
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:39,070
<i>( Oscar laughing )</i>

751
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:52,120
- Oh! Sorry.
- You were gone long enough.

752
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,120
I am really sorry, darling.

753
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,120
I was going
to go to dinner without you.

754
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,650
It's just incredibly hard
to get away.

755
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,160
You saw what he's like.

756
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,090
- She there too?
- Who?

757
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,760
Wrong answer, Nigel.
Yes or no would have been fine.

758
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,300
But "who"?
You know perfectly well
who I mean.

759
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,130
Oh, right, Mimi.

760
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,040
Yeah, she rolled up
just as I was leaving.

761
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,640
Odd creature.

762
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,070
So you said--
odd, but not bad-looking.

763
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,710
Most men
would find her stunning.

764
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,440
Most women too,
for that matter.

765
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,310
Well, look,
I am not most men.

766
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:25,550
I'm your husband, right?

767
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,220
There we go.

768
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,120
Here they are,
all locked up.

769
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,160
- Oh, hello.
- I say, is this
your little girl?

770
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,160
It is indeed.
Amrita, say hello
to the lady and gentleman.

771
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,130
- Hello.
- Hello, Amrita.

772
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:38,190
That's a very pretty name.
It's almost as pretty
as you are.

773
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,460
Quite enchanting.
Where have you been hiding her?

774
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,500
I have a nanny
that looks after her.

775
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,200
- And your wife?
- I'm a widower, dear lady.

776
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,340
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

777
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,540
Anyway, it's lovely
to have a child on board.

778
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,810
Yeah, it makes a change
from all the wrinklies.

779
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:54,810
And you?
Have you provided
for your posterity?

780
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,550
Sorry?

781
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,750
I mean, you have a wife
that loves children so much.

782
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,650
I was just wondering
if you yourself have a family.

783
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,650
Uh, no, no,
we haven't, actually, no.

784
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,790
No, Nigel thinks the world
is overpopulated enough as it is

785
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:07,520
without us adding
to the problem.

786
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,560
Well, an admirable sentiment
in India, perhaps,

787
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,830
but surely the green fields
of England can afford

788
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:14,530
to have a few more mouths
to feed.

789
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,770
What?
Oh, I say, look at that. Look.

790
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:18,540
Oh, look, Amrita, look.
See?

791
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,570
- <i>Isn't that beautiful?</i>
<i>- Nigel:</i> <i>You cold, darling?</i>

792
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:23,210
Gosh, I should have
brought my coat.

793
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,480
Oh, please,
allow me.

794
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,340
- Oh, that's very kind.
- Here we are.

795
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,280
Thank you,
thank you.

796
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,850
I'll just go and--
I'll fetch you something
from the cabin.

797
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:34,680
- See you in a sec.
- Okay.

798
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:37,450
Believe me, dear lady,

799
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,490
children are a better form
of marital therapy

800
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:42,430
- than any trip to India.
- ( Fiona laughs )

801
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,170
You mustn't believe
all he says.

802
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,810
He's a sick man.

803
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:00,880
He imagines things.

804
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,180
Please, don't think
badly of me.

805
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:13,420
I mean, what are you
playing at this time?

806
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,730
It matters to me
what you think.

807
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:19,430
Does it?

808
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,300
Does it really?

809
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,470
I have to talk with you,
Nigel.

810
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:25,740
I have to explain.

811
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,140
All right.

812
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,470
Go ahead.

813
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,640
No, not here.

814
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,680
My cabin.
We won't be disturbed there.

815
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,250
Please.

816
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:41,150
Um, I can't-- I'm afraid--
afraid I can't, not now.

817
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:43,390
No, later.

818
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:47,160
5:00, cabin DS1.

819
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,660
Yes?

820
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,440
<i>( Fiona talking )</i>

821
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,880
A newspaper!
( laughs )

822
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,910
- Brought your coat.
- Ah. Thanks, Mr. Singh.

823
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,780
Very well.

824
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:15,690
What a lovely story.

825
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,390
Say thank you, Amrita.

826
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,190
So if your daddy will let me,

827
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:22,430
I'll come tell you
some other stories sometime.
Would you like that?

828
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:23,430

829
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:25,330
Two hearts.

830
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,530
Pass.

831
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:29,900
Four hearts.

832
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,730
<i>Ich</i> pass.

833
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,570
No bid.

834
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:34,770
Pass.

835
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:00,460
Uh, you won't believe this,
but I've got to go and see
that chap again.

836
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,430
I thought you'd had enough
of all that.

837
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,800
I know, it's just he won't
take no for an answer.

838
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,740
Uh, I'm so sorry,

839
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:11,440
but I've simply got to go.

840
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,680
I wonder, would you like
to take my place?

841
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,980
- I should be delighted.
- Great.

842
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,280
Bridge just keeps on going.

843
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,350
I once played 48 hours
nonstop.

844
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,590
You leave your partner
in safe hands.

845
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:25,520
Excellent.
I do apologize.

846
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,020
Please excuse me.

847
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,360
<i>Entschuldigung</i> and all that.

848
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:46,680
( knocking )

849
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:18,340
Mimi ( whispering ):
<i>Close the door.</i>

850
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,630
April fool!

851
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:45,500
( laughing )

852
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,540
You pathetic, sick--

853
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,880
Do you want her?

854
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,810
Yes or no.

855
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,480
I don't want anything more
to do with either of you, ever.

856
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,450
Let go.
Let me go or I'll--

857
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:05,820
"Let me go
or I'll call my mommy!"

858
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:09,460
Go on, get out.

859
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:12,560
Crawl back
to your matrimonial tomb.

860
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,540
You know what?
I pity you.

861
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,140
I genuinely pity you both

862
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:25,610
<i>if this is the way</i>
<i>you have to get your kicks.</i>

863
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:27,440
I get no kicks out of this,
believe me.

864
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,980
Yes, and what was this--
what was this little farce,
then?

865
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,520
<i>How else</i>
<i>could we get you here?</i>

866
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,720
And why is that suddenly
of such incredible importance?

867
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,130
Mimi wants you to hear
the rest of our story.

868
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:44,690
She thinks it'll help
her chances with you.

869
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,030
( laughs )

870
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:48,600
What are you, her pimp?

871
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,770
I don't begrudge Mimi
the right to look elsewhere

872
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:53,040
for what I can
no longer supply.

873
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,840
I merely supervise her affairs

874
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:59,780
instead of submitting
to them.

875
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,650
You can have her, Nigel,

876
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:06,120
with my blessings,
on one condition.

877
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,850
You hear me out.

878
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,430
You make me sick.

879
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:17,630
<i>Why are you</i>
<i>still standing here?</i>

880
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:21,030
<i>( laughs )</i>
<i>Come on, Nigel.</i>

881
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:23,500
It was a joke.

882
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,840
Have a sense of humor,
for Christ's sake.

883
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,970
Come on, sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

884
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:29,970
Use my wheelchair.

885
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:34,140

( sighs )

888
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,160
Have a heart, Nigel.

889
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,530
Don't be too rough on a man
demolished

890
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:56,700
by a love
that was too strong.

891
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,910
Yes, sir.

892
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:08,780
We should have stopped
right there.

893
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:12,820
Lovers should quit
when their passion
is at its peak,

894
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:17,090
not wait
until its inevitable decline.

895
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:27,900
<i>As it was, my desire for her</i>
<i>had begun to wane.</i>

896
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:35,070
<i>There she would lie,</i>
<i>gorgeous, voluptuous,</i>

897
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:37,870
<i>and it didn't</i>
<i>do a thing for me.</i>

898
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,140
<i>I came to resent</i>
<i>her failure to excite me</i>

899
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,150
<i>the way she used to.</i>

900
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:49,150
( man speaking French )

901
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:52,560
<i>We were developing</i>

902
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,520
<i>on television,</i>

903
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,990

906
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:14,780
<i>A New York editress</i>

907

908
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:18,610

909
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:20,720
<i>It was a PR job.</i>

910
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,550
<i>And I was apprehensive</i>
<i>of her reaction to Mimi,</i>

911
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,690
<i>who tended to upstage</i>
<i>every other woman in sight.</i>

912
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:28,160
You wearing that?

913
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,260
Mmm.

914
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:31,330
- That dress?
- What about it?

915
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,030
Couldn't you wear
something else?

916
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,940
What's wrong with it?

917
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,170
<i>Nothing.</i>

918
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:43,570
What do you mean, nothing?

919
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:47,180
You think it makes me
look fat, eh?

920
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,310
You think it makes
my ass look fat.

921
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,980
Did I say that?

922
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:53,180
You think I've got
a fat ass.

923
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,750
You said that.
I didn't.

924
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:56,220
So you do think
I've got a fat ass.

925
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,290
Jesus, Mimi,
give me a break.

926
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:01,190
You wouldn't have said that
once upon a time.

927
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:02,930
You liked my ass.

928
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:06,860
I still like your ass.
I'm crazy about your ass.

929
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:08,730
You don't love me anymore.

930
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:11,070
For Christ's sake,
wear what you fucking want,
Mimi.

931
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:13,640
Wear a fucking bathrobe
for all I care.

932
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:24,750
The trouble is, Oscar,
publishing isn't what
it used to be.

933
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:26,950
It's the bottom line
that counts now.

934
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:29,890
Proven track records,
advance sales.

935
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:32,660
No one's going
to invest in a newcomer
who hasn't proven himself.

936
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,960
So an unknown
can't get published
unless he's known?

937
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,960
Sounds like
a catch-22 to me.

938
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,860
<i>Well, you could call it that.</i>

939
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,760
<i>And your Parisian settings</i>
<i>don't help any.</i>

940
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,300
When are you going
to come back home?

941
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,730
The United States,
where it's at?

942
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,940
No, you wouldn't do that.

943
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,940
Oscar's a fixture here.
He's like the Eiffel Tower.

944
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:50,670
He's right, Beverly.
I love it here.

945
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,680
- I feel at home.
- <i>Good for you.</i>

946
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,380
Come on, get a life.

947
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:57,250
Paris is out-- <i>vieux jeu.</i>
<i>It's a literary mausoleum.</i>

948
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:00,650
<i>Henry Miller used it up</i>
<i>50 years ago.</i>

949
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:04,090
<i>God, I don't think</i>
<i>France has been the same</i>
<i>since they gave up absinthe.</i>

950
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:05,690
Oh!

951
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:07,320
- Ah, sorry, I'm fine.
- Hey!

952
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,790
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Let me clean it up.

953
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:10,760
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>I'm fine, I'm fine.</i>

954
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:15,430
You know what?
I should make you my agent.

955
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,340
That'd solve all my problems.

956
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,440
"Paris is out.
<i>Vieux jeu."</i>

957
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,670
You really did me
some good tonight.

958
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,980
Like I don't have enough trouble
getting published.

959
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,210
I couldn't bear to see you
crawl up her ass like that.

960
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:31,750
I'll crawl up the ass
of anyone I fucking well
feel like.

961
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,020
Yours isn't the only one
in town.

962
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:35,220
Is that how you feel?

963
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,950
<i>That's exactly how I feel.</i>

964
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:38,750
In that case,
I'd better go.

965
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,760
<i>Okay, you do that.</i>

<i>Uh-huh.</i>

969
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:23,230
- Are you sad I'm going?
- Uh-huh.

970
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:25,740
<i>You're not sad.</i>

971
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:30,340
I am sad.
But it's better this way.

972
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:43,250
<i>( typing continues )</i>

973
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:53,800

01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,000
Thanks.

975
01:07:57,370 --> 01:08:00,840
( sobbing )
I love you. I love you so much.

976
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,970
Please don't make me go.

977
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:05,270
Please.

978
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:11,250
Stop crying.

979
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,350
Go make some coffee
or something, huh?

980
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:49,350
Oscar:
<i>I came to dread bedtime.</i>

981
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:57,430
<i>I would feel</i>

Gee.

983
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:02,400

<i>I'd feel sorry for her.</i>

986
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,480
Good night.

<i>Lying there with her belly</i>

989
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:22,850
Kiss me good night.

990
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:32,960
Not like that.
Hold me.

Oh, la la.

1016

I didn't know
you were so delicate.

- What do you mean, delicate?
- <i>I mean delicate.</i>

1018
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,290
I know what you mean,
but it's just not the right word
in English.

1019
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:38,290
If you don't know the right word
in English, say it in French.

1020
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:41,420
I don't say it in French
because your French
isn't good enough.

1021
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,430
<i>It's better</i>
<i>than your English.</i>

1022
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:45,690
After all these years
in Paris?

1023
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,300
So it should be.

1024
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,260
Maybe your English
isn't that good either.

1025
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:52,700
<i>Maybe that's why no one</i>
<i>wants to publish your books.</i>

1026
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,240
Now you're a literary critic?

1027
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,410
That's great
coming from a waitress.

1028
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:59,740
I'm not a waitress.
I'm a dancer.

Come on, say something.

1039
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:48,560
Please.

1040
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,600
God Almighty.

1041
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,200

1042
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,440

<i>( woman speaking French )</i>

1045
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:19,820
<i>Bonjour.</i>
<i>( speaks French )</i>

<i>( woman speaking )</i>

1051
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,770
- No, no.

<i>Allô? All?</i>

1053
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:45,680
<i>J'ai mal.</i>

1054
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:48,750
Where?

1055
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:51,150
<i>Où tu as mal?</i>

1056
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:54,420
My head.

1057
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,230
Is it bad?

1058
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:58,730
How bad is it?

1059
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:00,500
Tiger.

1060
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:04,270
Should I call a doctor?

1061
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:06,270
Just hold me.

1062
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,180
Baby, forgive me, please.

1063
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,910
I love you.

1064
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,730
Wow, it's great.

1065
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:32,830
Thank you.
Oh, thank you!

1066
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:34,430
I'm so happy.

1067
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:53,420
What a lovely evening.

1068
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:55,480
I wish it could last forever.

1069
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:59,450
Forever's a long time, baby.

1070
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:02,820
I can't think in those terms.
I never could.

1071
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:07,500
When something is good,
don't you want it
to last forever?

1072
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,570
<i>Sure, but good things</i>
<i>never do.</i>

1073
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:12,370
Not even us?

1074
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:15,870
Are we so good?

1075
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:19,410
<i>Aren't we?</i>

1076
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:22,880
Well, now that you come
to mention it, no.

1077
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,980
<i>Not anymore.</i>

1078
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,590
<i>Come on, Mimi,</i>

1079
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:34,320
<i>let's stop</i>
<i>kidding ourselves.</i>

1080
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:36,230
I don't understand.

1081
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:39,800
Look, it was sweet
while it lasted.

1082
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,660
Boy, it was sweet.

1083
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:44,330
But it's going sour,
isn't it?

1084
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:49,670
- <i>Well, isn't it?</i>
<i>- ( sobs )</i>

1085
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:52,740
<i>You know, I've been hoping</i>
<i>that you'd take the initiative.</i>

1086
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:56,350
<i>But, no, you seem quite happy</i>
<i>to let things keep on</i>
<i>dragging on this way.</i>

1087
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:58,450
<i>Well, I'm not.</i>
<i>I'm degrading myself</i>

1088
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:00,320
by degrading you.

1089
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:04,320
We're degrading each other,
for God's sake.

1090
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,260
Let's not spoil
a beautiful memory.

1091
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:10,030
<i>Let's quit while we still</i>
<i>have a few shreds</i>
<i>of dignity left.</i>

1092
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:13,960
But I love you.

1093
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:18,300
And I want to--
I want to marry you.

1094
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,840
I want to give you babies.

1095
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,040
I want to give you
the rest of my life.

1096
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,540
I don't want
the rest of your life.
I want my own.

1097
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,010
Can't you get it
through your head?

1098
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,680
What did I do wrong?

1099
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,850
Did I ever harm you?

1100
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:37,320
Oscar, tell me.

1101
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:40,460
Even a criminal
is told his crime.

1102
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,490
What did I do?

1103
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:48,700
You didn't do anything.

1104
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,730
You exist, that's all.

1105
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:06,320
I understand.

1106
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:26,000
Oscar:
<i>Did I miss her?</i>

1107
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,870
<i>Sure, I did.</i>

1108
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:31,870
<i>But I also experienced</i>
<i>an incredible sense of freedom.</i>

1109
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,940
<i>The future</i>
<i>seemed bright with promise,</i>

1110
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:38,710
<i>peopled with</i>
<i>a thousand alluring images,</i>

1111
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,820
<i>most of them female.</i>

1112
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:44,350
( singing in French )

1113
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:47,860
- <i>( phone ringing )</i>
<i>- Shit!</i>

1114
01:17:54,430 --> 01:17:56,100
<i>Oui?</i>

1115
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:59,030
Mimi:
<i>It's me. Oscar?</i>

1116
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,000
I'm here.

1117
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,840
<i>I'm scared.</i>

1118
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,370
What?

1119
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,140
<i>I can't live without you.</i>

1120
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,910
I'm afraid you're
just going to have to.

1121
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:09,610
<i>I won't.</i>

1122
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:13,520
Look, we've been
through all this before,
haven't we?

1123
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,520
So why don't we
give it a rest?

1124
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,750
Look up some friends,
have some fun.

1125
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,160
We just went
over the top, that's all.

1126
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:25,130
In a few days,
you'll be grateful to me
for having made the first move.

1127
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:27,760
<i>( dial tone beeping )</i>

1128
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:33,900
<i>( rock music playing )</i>

1129
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,170
Oscar:
<i>Was she playacting?</i>

1130
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:37,440
<i>I couldn't be sure.</i>

1131
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,080
<i>I called her old roommate.</i>

1132
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,580
<i>No dice.</i>

1133
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:44,480
<i>I spent the rest</i>
<i>of the day wondering,</i>

1134
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,420
<i>half the night drinking.</i>

1135
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:10,070
I was waiting for you.

1136
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:13,140
- I can see that.
I wonder why.
- You know why.

1137
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:15,180
I know I'm wrecked
and I'm gonna crash.

1138
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:16,780
No, wait!

1139
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:18,480
- <i>( dog barking )</i>
<i>- Let go of me.</i>

1140
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,120
No, I want
to tell you something.

1141
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,820
There's nothing more
to be said, Mimi.

1142
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:23,080
- Please!
- For Christ's sake.

1143
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:24,690
It's not going to make it
any easier on us.

1144
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:27,660
You-- you've got
to listen to me, please.

1145
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:29,460
- Please listen to me.
- Oh, for God's sake.

1146
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:32,790
- Please!
- ( barking )

1147
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,900
( speaks French )

1148
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:38,930
All right.

1149
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,040
You better come in.

1150
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,570
( keys jangling )

1151
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:03,560
You want one?

1152
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:10,200
All right.

1153
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,200
What's so important?

1154
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,900
It's true what I said.

1155
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,970
I can't live without you.

1156
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:18,870
Oh, if that's all
you came to tell me--

1157
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,510
- Please don't throw me out!
- It's too late.

1158
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:22,610
Give me one last chance.

1159
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:27,020
I'm ready to live with you
on any terms, any at all.

1160
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:30,150
I can't bear anything else
because when I'm with you
sometimes--

1161
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:32,850
( sobbing )

1162
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:35,120
You can shout at me.

1163
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,060
You can leave me.
You can have other women.

1164
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:40,200
I don't care
what you do,

1165
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,660
but please...

1166
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:44,930
don't send me away.

1167
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:48,640
Even if
you don't love me anymore,

1168
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:52,140
keep me with you
out of pity.

1169
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:56,040
There's nothing
I wouldn't do to stay with you.

1170
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:58,580
Please, please!

1171
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:00,780
Please!

1172
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:03,550
I beg you!

<i>If she really fancied</i>

<i>I'd make it so hot,</i>

1180

<i>even she would want out.</i>

1181
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:31,680
It feels so good.

1182
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,350
Yeah, it does, Cindy.

Cindy?

I mean Mimi.

Uh, Mimi.

Sure, I'm on.

Tonight?

1199

What's so special
about tonight?

1200
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,430
- It's your holiday.
- What holiday?

1201
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,300
Thanksgiving.

1202
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:01,400
I wanted to surprise you.

1203

Turkey.

I cooked it

try a little?

You're joking.

Listen, in the future,
forget about cooking.

How long have you known?

1266
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:04,680
Only since yesterday.

1267
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,950
Two months,

Look at me.

01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:30,070
Do I look like a daddy?

1272

it might be better

1277

and be done with it.

1278
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:09,980
Would it be fair
to saddle a child
with a father like this?

1279
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:13,410
Be honest.

You're here.
Nothing else matters.

01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:25,390
I've been thinking.

When you're on your feet,

1294
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,120

No, quite impossible,
I'm afraid.

1553
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:15,300

- Who was it?

1557
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:26,670
"Paris is out.
<i>Vieux jeu."</i>

Beverly, you mean?
What did she want?

1559
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:34,450
What did she want,

1560

How would I know?

1561
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:38,620
Well, you might
have let me speak to her.

1562
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:44,120
I said, you might
have let me speak to her.

01:46:44,130 --> 01:46:46,430
I heard you.

1564
01:46:46,430 --> 01:46:51,230
Jesus, Mimi,
I never get to see
or speak to a soul these days.

1565
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:53,130
It's like I'm in solitary.

1566

Is it?

1567
01:46:56,740 --> 01:47:00,270
Look,

1568
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,580
I know I deserve
all I get.

1569
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:05,880
I treated you
like a monster.

1570
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:08,320
- I am a monster.
- Tiger!

1571
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:11,280
You don't have the right
to criticize yourself.

1572
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:13,420
That's my privilege.

1573
01:47:13,420 --> 01:47:15,620
- I know.
- <i>I earned it.</i>

1574
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:18,690
But I promise,
I will never hurt you again.

1575
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:25,870
You hurt me?

1576
01:47:25,870 --> 01:47:27,330
Very funny.

1577
01:47:31,910 --> 01:47:34,740
And don't play

1578

01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:46,510
As much as you missed me

01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:52,990
Why not?
I love scenes.

1587
01:48:52,990 --> 01:48:55,360
I've developed
a taste for them.

1588
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:57,520
In fact,
I can't do without them.

1589
01:48:57,530 --> 01:48:59,790
What is that?

1590
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:02,260
What do you think it is?

1591
01:49:02,260 --> 01:49:06,770
What do you expect
if you go out and leave me
alone all night?

1592
01:49:06,770 --> 01:49:09,870
I wet myself, of course.

Oh, poor tiger.

God, you stink.

1596
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:18,580
Why don't you
just finish me off?

1597
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:23,280
Why don't you O.D. me

You never will,

Oscar:
<i>We were like the survivors</i>
