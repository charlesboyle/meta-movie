- No, cricket!

No, it's with a ball and the flat bat.

- It's a game.

They must be some small

- Listen. Yeah, listen.
- What else we got?

00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,690
Turn it! Turn it! Hold it!

349
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,856
That's it, that's it!

350
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:29,028
Right. So, here's
the cricket uniform.

351
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:34,492
There's the cricket field...

352
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,450
The rules...

353
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,002
I could print it for ya.

354
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,880
- Yeah. Mm-hmm!
- Yeah.

355
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,966
Is there, uh, anything else?

356
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,053
(MUMBLING)

357
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:53,849
Can you show us some
photos of naughty nurses?

358
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,434
Sure.

359
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,887
(TYPING)

360
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,768
- I got 'em.
- Great.

361
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:07,521
All right, okay.

362
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:11,282
Now, it is your civic duty

363
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:16,120
to study these rules. We must
all become cricket aficionados.

364
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,665
Put them out there. Here we go.

365
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:22,210
It's kind of like baseball
but it's only got two bases

366
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,462
and no one wears gloves.

367
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,131
One guy wears a glove!

368
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,175
One guy wears a glove.

369
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:38,059
Now the cricket pitch is a circle
with a rectangle in the middle.

370
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,353
You can do that, right?
You got lime?

371
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,604
Sure, I got bags.

372
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,852
All right, let's get to it.

373
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:52,317
Oof! We're gonna need
a whole lot of whites.

374
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,364
Where are we going to
get all these whites?

375
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,904
Hmm...

376
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,090
(GRUNTS)

377
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:12,135
One, two, three.

378
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,192
- These are pink!
- Yeah, we can just bleach 'em.

379
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,779
- But these are pink!
- We can just bleach them!

380
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:37,702
And so the doctor will be staying
in our beautiful home for a month.

381
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,245
What about us?

382
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,330
Oh, we'll be staying
with the Williamses.

383
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,533
(SCOFFING)

384
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:50,040
Anyone else have any announcements
they'd like to make?

385
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:53,634
- Lucy?
- What?

386
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,637
Anything anyone would like to share?

387
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,807
News, updates?

388
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,893
New milestones achieved?

389
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,768

390
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,535
- MURRAY: This is it.
- What?

391
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,706
Huh?

392
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,205
Sweet Jesus.

393
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,122
Do we know how to hook it up?

394
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,298
No idea.

395
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,550
It's still very pink.

396
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,720
That's not pink. (CHUCKLES)

397
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,556
(SEWING MACHINE WHIRRING)

398
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,509
It's pink.

399
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,680
Even at night, it's horrendous.

400
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:23,349
(LOON CALLING)

401
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,021
- What the hell are you talkin' about?
- Nothing, really.

402
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,191
- Just, you know, everybody's pitchin' in.
- Yeah,

403
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,986
- you're using my attic!
- Oh, well, we appreciate that,

404
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,906
but this would really help,
and only you can do it.

405
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,407
Out of the question!

406
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,160
Just... a little flirt.

407
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,786
Murray, no!

408
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,872
- I'm not talkin' about intercourse.
- Intercourse?

409
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:49,000
I said I am not talking
about intercourse.

410
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,128
- I'm not a hooker, Murray.
- I know you're not a hooker!

411
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:55,256
You're a beautiful, young woman.

412
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,216
All I'm asking is if it's possible

413
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,011
to adopt a flirtatious
attitude towards the doctor.

414
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,639
No! He's happily engaged.

415
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,308
Yeah, exactly!

416
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,476
So what would be the point
of me flirtin' with him?

417
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,437
Well, just his manhood, you know,

418
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,731
just let him feel
desired and feel alive,

419
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,192
make Tickle Head a great
place to be a man!

420
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,566
And that's what you want?

421
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,613
That's would make you happy, Murray,

422
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:22,409
watching me come on to a stranger?

423
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,453
Yes.

424
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,163
No. The answer's no.

425
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,707
And if you asked me,
I'd say no to the factory too.

426
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,169
It's a petrochemical by-product
repurposing facility!

427
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,338
- It's the oil company!
- It's recycling!

428
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,173
That's good, eh? That's good, right?

429
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,467
No! That's just something
they're doin' for public image,

430
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,510
to repay for environmental
damage they done!

431
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:45,097
- So let 'em pay!
- I don't want the oil company here!

432
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,893
Well, you know, that's very easy
for you to say with a job, right?

433
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,646
Government job with vacation pay.

434
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,856
All I'm asking for
is a little flirt!

435
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,608
Hey, Annette.

436
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,936
You're cracked.

437
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,731
- You're cracked!
- I know you're good for it.

438
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:24,596
A cricket match is divided
into periods called innings.

439
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,557
One team fields and the other bats.

440
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:33,646
The two teams switch between fielding
and batting after each inning.

441
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,815
All right, so we switch around.

442
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:40,695
Now, all 11 members of the
fielding team take the field,

443
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,781
but only two members
of the batting team

444
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,492
are on the field at any given time.

445
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,119
You stand side by side or what?

446
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,912
Opposite ends of the field? Come on!

447
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,248
- Does this make sense to any of you guys?
- You wanna do it?

448
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,500
- (MIXED CHATTER)
- Give me a chance to look at it!

449
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:58,421
Joe! Joe, we're sorry we took
your oars now, all right?

450
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,089
- Give me the...
- Come on, that's enough!

451
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,542
Now's not the time for questions.

452
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,348

- All right, go!

453

Go!

454

- That was awful!
- Awful! Bloody awful!

455
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,894
Go!

456
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:14,937

457
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,064

a good deal of shame.

wanna work for the oil company.

to save this harbour.
