-Oh. That's not classic.

175
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,051
-That's what I'm saying.
-Before, after.

176
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,887
NORMAN: That's the way l go.
-God wants to see you.

177
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,142
-Our God?
-Who art on the fourth floor.

178
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,814
Mr. Lobruto? Mr. Beachum.

179
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,236
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

180
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,450
William "No Middle Initial" Beachum.

181
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,704
Wow, a 97 percent conviction rate.

182
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:33,124
-That's impressive.
-Thank you, sir.

183
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,836
Of course, you traded all
your losing cases to other DDAs.

184
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,422
Well...

185
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,510
...l took on two or three cases
for every one I gave away.

186
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,679
They just couldn't
handle their caseloads...

187
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,305
...and l don't like to lose.

188
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,933
You won't always win
working at Wooton Sims.

189
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,645
Working at Wooton Sims
sort of is winning.

190
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,980
Isn't it?

191
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,774
Well, you'll need a middle initial.

192
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,819
-Sir?
-Well, those guys all play squash...

193
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,779
...and have middle names.

194
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,365
They go in for their mother's
maiden name a lot.

195
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,410
Well, my mother
doesn't have a maiden name.

196
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,454
I think you belong here, William.

197
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,624
With all due respect, sir...

198
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,836
...l just didn't work this hard
to stay where l belong.

199
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:22,215
Yeah, well, l didn't think so.

200
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:27,012
Well, you have your
litigation experience...

201
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,304
...your chops...

202
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,350
...and your juicy private-sector job.

203
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,103
Pretty soon you'll be courtside
at Laker games.

204
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,731
Anything else the city
of Los Angeles can do for you?

205
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,567
No, sir. l think that'll be all.

It's a cummerbund, Willy.

207
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,156
That's gonna go
around your waist, okay?

208
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,241
-Okay. Are we good?
-Uh-huh.

209
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,285
-Good. Good.
-All right.

211
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,420
Willy, come on. Pick up the phone.

212
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,381
What, Norman?

213
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,758
Got an attempted homicide.

214
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,801
Guy shot his wife, she's in a coma.

215
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:10,555
Arraignment's at 3:00
with Judge Moran.

216
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,182
Three o'clock is in 1 5 minutes.

217
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,226
You do still actually work here--

218
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,353
Would you just find
somebody else to do it?

219
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,647
Everybody's booked.
It's not going to trial.

220
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,483
There's a weapon with prints...

221
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,901
...and a signed confession.

222
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,029
Just take the arraignment,
wait for the plea.

223
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,907
It's a real confession?

224
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,534
Spontaneous and signed.

225
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,244
Come on, Willy.

226
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,789
All right...

227
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,583
...but here's the problem.

228
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,293
MORAN:
That'll do! l've given my ruling.

229
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,712

they can take it outside.

00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,103
Mr. Beachum.

233
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,688
Nice to see a man
who dresses for court.

234
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,774
I'm very sorry, Your Honor.

235
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,692
I'm very sorry.

236
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,236
It's a long story.

00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:10,615
BAlLIFF: The people of the State
of California v. Theodore Crawford.

238
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,911
PUBLIC DEFENDER: The public defender
is representing Mr. Crawford...

239
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,289
...for his arraignment, with the
understanding that he will secure...

240
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,416
...private counsel
for further proceedings.

241
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,669
MORAN: Mr. Crawford,
you have been charged...

242
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,588
...with Section 664 slash 1 87...

243
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,967
...of the California penal code,
attempted murder.

244
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,219
Do you waive further
reading of the complaint...

245
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,596
-...and complete statement of rights?
PUBLIC DEFENDER: You do.

246
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:34,973
I do. But l--

247
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,225
And do you wish to enter
a plea at this time?

248
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:41,521
Yes, not guilty. But I also want to waive
my right to counsel and represent myself.

249
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,483
Surely you won't have trouble
finding an attorney, Mr. Crawford?

250
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,987
-No, but I want to do it.
-lf I can have a moment with my client....

251
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,281
I'm not your client.
Try and keep up, will you?

252
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,782
MORAN:
Mr. Crawford...

253
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,160
...you're facing some
very serious charges here.

254
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,745
I strongly urge you to retain counsel.

255
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,540
That's very kind,
but I believe l'm within my rights.

256
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,002
Be aware that lack of counsel
will not be grounds for an appeal.

257
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,129
Oh, l understand. l understand.

258
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,590
MORAN: The People have an objection,
Mr. Beachum?

259
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,636
Well, Your Honor, we have...

260
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:16,639
...a verbal and signed confession.

261
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:22,187
So l would strongly advise
Mr. Crawford to....

262
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,859
To get a competent attorney
to try and negotiate a plea.

263
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,612
That's pretty damning evidence.
You wanna reconsider?

264
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,071
Absolutely not.

265
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,781
It's gonna turn into a circus.

266
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,743
I appreciate your concern
for the dignity of the court, 007.

267
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,996
Unfortunately, the man
is a tax-paying citizen...

00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:43,583
...and entitled by our Constitution
to try and manipulate the system...

269
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:47,962
-...like everybody else.
-lf Mr. Crawford wants to go pro per...

270
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,632
...that's gonna take a while,
and sadly...

271
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,761
...l won't be here for it.
But the People have no objection.

272
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,971
Your Honor, l'd like to...

273
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,098
...waive my right
to preliminary hearing...

274
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,351
...and go direct to trial
as soon as possible.

275
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,269
Does that help you, Mr. Beachum?

276
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,563
MORAN: You don't have to worry
about Mr. Beachum.

277
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,816
The district attorney's office
will assign another prosecutor.

278
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,109
No, I like Mr. Beachum.

279

Mr. Beachum...

00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,491
...he likes you.

281
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,788
Yes. That's terrific.

282
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:26,167
It appears Crawford has an understanding
of his rights and responsibilities...

283
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,378
...so it's your call, Mr. Beachum.

284
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,513
Why not?

00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,767

There's something not right about him.

Calvin came to me for a deal.

00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:09,432
So l told him if he can get me
a meeting with Mr. Wooton...

...that l'd throw the case.

339
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:15,813
He set it up, but he came
to court unprepared...

Well, now she's dead,
