00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,346
This is Benjamin Mee.

3
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:41,612
I am surrounded by hundreds,
probably thousands of killer bees.

4
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,381
If I wasn't wearing this suit,
I would be dead in an instant!

5
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:48,691
<i>May I have
your attention, please?</i>

6
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:51,523
<i>He interviewed
dangerous dictators.</i>

7
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,935
What's your favorite movie?

8
00:01:11,036 --> 00:01:12,014
<i>Segunda.</i>

9
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,948
<i>He even ï¬‚ew into
the center of Hurricane Charley.</i>

10
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:18,817
<i>It was a Category 4 storm.</i>

11
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:20,582
How far are we from the eye?

12
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:22,090
About two minutes!

13
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:23,819
This hurricane, sir,

14
00:01:23,949 --> 00:01:25,895
Charley, is really kneading us well, sir.

15
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,726
Tell me when it gets severe!

16
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:33,494
<i>He knew the ins and outs
of strange and exotic adventure,</i>

17
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,401
<i>backwards and forwards.</i>

18
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,966
<i>But nothing prepared
him for this one.</i>

19
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:41,510
Come on, come on. We're late, guys.
Let's go. Come on.

20
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,242
- Come on, come on. We're really late.

21
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,648
- Dad, can you get my hair?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:50,276
Dad, I'll just get waffles.

23
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,912
No, no, no, I want you to have eggs, man.

24
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,013
- We have time. You need the protein.
- We don't have time.

25
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:56,218
- Mama always gave me almond milk.
- Dad, you didn't read the label.

26
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:57,555
You didn't read the label.

27
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,027
- These aren't gluten free.
- Will you do that?

28
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:00,755
- I can't eat these!
- Did anybody even say good morning?

29
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:02,298
- Hello, Benjamin Mee.
- Take your thing.

30
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,265
- Look, Dad, the dog!
- Don't step on the...

31
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:05,767
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi, Sharon.

32
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:08,270
No, I can't... I can't go hiking.

33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,430
It's just not a great time for me.

34
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:11,166
<i>Okay. Okay.
Listen, I'm gonna call again tomorrow.</i>

35
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,833
<i>- Okay, thank you.
- Great!</i>

36
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:15,172
Where's our lunches?

37
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:17,672
What is on your feet?

38
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:19,111
Reindeer slippers.

39
00:02:19,204 --> 00:02:20,979
Look, I am the one
who gets the emails

40
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:23,815
about your lack of effort, man. Okay?

41
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:26,214
You either know where the book is
or you don't.

42
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:28,689
Dad, it's whatever.
Look, I'll know it when I get to school.

43
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:31,317
You know what?
"Whatever" is the laziest word

44
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,828
of the 20th century, all right?

45
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:34,329
I'm... I've had it with "whatever."

46
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,492
I don't want to hear it again
in this century ever again.

47
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:39,626
"Whatever" is over.

48
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:43,002
He says it all the time. He won't have
anything left to say in this century.

49
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:45,837
I'm not lettin' you out of the car
till I get a new word.

50
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:47,239
You know, you gotta focus, man.

51
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:48,811
If you focused as much on your homework

52
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,574
as you do on your artwork,
you'd have it all.

53
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,808
- But as it is...
- Dad, I finished The Seventh Tower.

54
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:55,181
...you're gonna get an F.

55
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:05,085
Pernicious.

56
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:07,391
Thank you.

57
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:10,762
Good word.

58
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:15,065
Dad. Nobody's gonna give an F
to a kid whose mom died six months ago.

59
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,001
What does perni... pern...

60
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,668
pernicious mean?

61
00:03:23,302 --> 00:03:26,613
It's causing insidious harm or ruin.

62
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:29,843
Causing damage.

63
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,918
Get out, get out, get out.

64
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:36,583
Keep goin', guys, come on.

65
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:39,260
Dad!

66
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:41,062
Man, all right.

67
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:43,030
I'll get you a new...
I'll get you a new bag.

68
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:46,968
Come on, sweetie. Come on.
Okay, where did Mom get the backpacks?

69
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:48,469
- Mr. Mae?
- Just don't worry about it.

70
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:50,369
- Hi. Oh, okay.
- Benjamin, I thought maybe...

71
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:53,033
Here you go, guys.
Here's your bag, sweetheart. Here.

72
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,942
There's one, there's two, all right.
Goodbye.

73
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,945
- Bye, honey.
- Bye, Dad!

74
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,447
Bye, hon!

75
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,543
I thought, maybe...

76
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,950
it's lasagna. Dinner for three.

77
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:05,653
Great, thank you.

78
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:08,089
Or four.

79
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:12,989
You know, my brother is actually
coming for dinner tonight.

80
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:14,495
So that's perfect.

81
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,964
And I'll get the dish back to you
within the week.

82
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,729
In time. In time.

83
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,802
In time, then.

84
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:25,740
Thank you.

85
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:28,141
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, sweetheart.

86
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:39,287
Benjamin, I've arrived at a thought.

87
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:41,119
Tell me, Dunc.

88
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:44,820
I believe you should court the girl
we met at Jamba Juice.

89
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,157
She's a stunner.

90
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:49,997
She keeps callin' me to go hiking.

91
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:53,165
- Benjamin, hike her.

92
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,697
All right. Let's see.

93
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:58,103
<i>Cerrado.</i>

94
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,473
Yeah, looks like
Bernie's closed for renovations.

95
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,876
Which means Bernie's hung over.

96
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,313
Is she a stunner? I mean,
is that what they call a stunner now?

97
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:09,648
I mean, what do I know?
I was spoiled. I had the real thing.

98
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,480
Well, what else do we have around here?

99
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:17,418
Got Little Dom's.

100
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:19,462
No.

101
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:23,158
- Hey.
- Nope. No.

102
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,436
Look. The world is gonna get very small

103
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:29,369
if you don't go to any of the places
where you and Katherine used to go.

104
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:31,607
I met her there.

105
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:35,668
- Man, I'm sorry. That's right.
- It's all right, man.

106
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:38,509
You know, I gotta get back anyway.
Want to just do it next week?

107
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,349
Look.

108
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,545
You gotta let a little sunlight in. Okay?

109
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:52,659
Take it from a guy who spent six months
on a commercial fishing boat in Bali

110
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,162
trying to find himself.

111
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,290
- Remember that?

112
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:59,626
Yeah. And you know what I found?

113
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,670
I missed people.

114
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,175
So just do me a favor.

115
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,835
Attempt to start over.

116
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:14,517
I shall try to start over.

117
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:18,247
- You're handsome!
- Hey-a, so are you!

118
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,355
All right.

119
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:21,355
- I love you, my brother.
- I love you, too, man.

120
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:23,084
You're a good guy.

121
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,226
Sunlight.

122
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,589
- Human interaction.
- Got it!

123
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,502
Joy.

124
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:34,264
All right, McGinty, so get this.

125
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:38,205
I go to the volcano eruption site.
And I take the kids.

126
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,506
And I write about the end of the world
from the point of view

127
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,238
of the generation that's gonna save it.

128
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:45,678
And we do a whole thing
about how life is elemental,

129
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:47,773
and all the software, and laptops,

130
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:49,408
and apps in the world
aren't gonna change that.

131
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,612
And we call it... You ready?

132
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,357
IPocalypse.

133
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:57,852
Wow. Just wow.

134
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,520
It's good, right?
I mean, I think it could be a series,

135
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:01,029
like the killer bees.

136
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,564
That is bold stuff.

137
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:04,361
You're not gonna say yes, are you?

138
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:06,026
No. Listen.

139
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:08,764
I think we should give you
an online column.

140
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:12,034
That way, you'll be protected.
This is the way we live now.

141
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,907
If the paper goes down or gets sold,
you'll still be safe.

142
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:17,810
You'll be viral.

143
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,045
Don't keep me around out of...

144
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:21,583
lam not!

145
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:24,415
Out of sympathy. I mean, I hate sympathy.

146
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:25,920
I'm sick of sympathy.

147
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:27,923
I know.

148
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:32,654
- You know what?
- Bad things happen. You just keep going.

149
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:36,264
I quit.

150
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,427
Benjamin. You lost your wife, man.

151
00:07:39,524 --> 00:07:43,062
In some quarters, sympathy would be
considered the appropriate response.

152
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:46,904
No, I'm not gonna sit around here
and spin my wheels

153
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,809
and live in a state of sponsored pity.

154
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:53,747
Please! Let me lay you off
so you can get the benefits!

155
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,750
That's more sympathy! No!

156
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:56,819
I quit.

157
00:07:56,942 --> 00:08:00,151
And I love you. And those patched elbows.

158
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,353
- You're killin' me.
- I'll miss you.

159
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,983
Text me.

160
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:06,662
Benjamin Mee.

161
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,930
- Classy. Real classy.

162
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:15,766
They left the cashbox right on the counter.

163
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:19,269
It was kind of their fault
if you think about it.

164
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,006
That's three suspensions in one semester.

165
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,511
That's gotta be some kind of record.

166
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,149
Yeah, well, maybe I'll get a prize.

167
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,445
Could you possibly be
making a joke right now?

168
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,349
- Jesus, that is annoying!

169
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:40,326
- Dad, stop.
- No, I can fix it.

170
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,199
Dad, here he come...

171
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:52,164
Frame's a little loose. I...

172
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:54,008
Just give me one second.

173
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:56,841
I'm fine with my squeaky window, Mr. Mee.

174
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:59,381
In fact, I rather enjoy it.

175
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:02,709
Besides today's theft,

176
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,687
there's a darkness here
that we need to deal with.

177
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:08,314
Mr. Devereaux, Dylan's art teacher,

178
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:11,587
wanted you to see his wall mural.

179
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:19,329
We encourage creativity at the school.

180
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:21,370
There's a nice treatment
of the word "love".

181
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,864
A whimsical portraiture of recycling.

182
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:28,206
A hard-hitting exposÃ© about world peace.

183
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,674
Here is the great Bob Marley.

184
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:33,511
Though we don't endorse
all that he stood for.

185
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:35,414
Sunflowers.

186
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:38,845
And guess which one is your son's.

187
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:46,259
We're a three-strike school, Mr. Mee,
and today was his fourth strike.

188
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:50,592
I'm sorry. We have to expel Dylan.

189
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:56,233
But, as one parent to another, I...

190
00:09:57,162 --> 00:09:59,540
I would examine his inner life.

191
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,645
Let's go.

192
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:45,181
It's like he was expelling me
for my artwork.

193
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,415
I can almost live with the artwork.

194
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:50,493
I mean, if Charles Manson needed
a personal muralist, you'd be the guy.

195
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:52,925
But no, he didn't expel you
because of the artwork.

196
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:55,430
He expelled you because you stole.

197
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:58,266
You stole!

198
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:00,997
It breaks my heart.

199
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:16,046
Dad, someday you're gonna
have to eat some of that lasagna.

200
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:17,278
Honey...

201
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,621
Or throw it away.

202
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:32,331
Hey, why didn't you go to Sadie's
for the play date, sweetie?

203
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:35,629
No reason. Lots to do here.

204
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:41,375
Hey, Rosie?

205
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:46,306
Am I doin' anything right?

206
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,985
You're handsomer than the other dads.

207
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,851
Lots of them don't have hair.
So that's good.

208
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,484
Awesome. I'm gonna take baldness
off my list of things to worry about.

209
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:03,530
Good.

210
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,665
Daddy, I can't sleep. The neighbors again.

211
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:49,231
Come on.

212
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:05,412
Their happy is too loud.

213
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:25,873
Hey!

214
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,908
<i>It's a new
day for you, Mr. B.</i>

215
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:38,454
We have a full day
of house hunting planned

216
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,352
and I think you'll be very excited
at what's available.

217
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:43,118
We just want new. We want new...
New everything.

218
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:45,626
New opportunities, new schools, just new.

219
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,458
In the current economic environment,

220
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:51,193
you're gonna find that now,
the buyer is now the king.

221
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,963
But what I'm hopin' for
is like a big backyard.

222
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,369
Substantial, you know, just rolling hills.

223
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:59,373
It's gonna be very hard
to find rolling hills in the city.

224
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:02,000
- It just... it's just not available!
- Right, well...

225
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,737
I mean, stationary hills. We...

226
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:05,370
The hills don't have to roll, right, honey?

227
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:07,676
- Yeah?
- Just new.

228
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:09,877
Know what? it's all about new.
People love new.

229
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:12,420
I love new. Hell, I'm new!
Excuse my language, but I'm new.

230
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,921
- All right.
- Hell, I'm new.

231
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:15,251
I'm glad you're excited about it.

232
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,587
- You know? I'm excited about new stuff.
- Good.

233
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:20,195
- New is the new old.
- New.

234
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:21,696
- New, new, new.
- New.

235
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:24,198
- I like you.
- I like you, too, Rosie.

236
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:27,331
I wish Dylan had come with us. This is fun.

237
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:29,666
I wish Dylan were here, too.

238
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,866
The more, the merrier.
That's what I always say, right?

239
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:33,271
Our mommy died.

240
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:35,377
Oh, wow.

241
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:39,882
My condolences go out
to you and your family, Mr. Mee.

242
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:41,416
Uh... Wow.

243
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:44,614
Sweetheart, Mr. Stevens
is a stranger, honey.

244
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,519
- He didn't know Mommy.
- I know, but he should have.

245
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,291
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

246
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:53,062
Just knowing you, Rosie, right now,

247
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:54,789
I love your mom.

248
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,592
I love her. You know how I picture her?

249
00:15:56,721 --> 00:16:00,032
I picture your face on a grown lady.

250
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:01,935
How long you been
doin' this job?

251
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,437
First day. it's my first day.

252
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,939
- Really?
- Hell, yeah. First day.

253
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:08,774
And so, our adventure begins.

254
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:21,084
Hmm. No.

255
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,689
Never.

256
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,595
Almost.

257
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:43,878
Not quite.

258
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:46,812
We are now running out of options.

259
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:49,149
Dad.

260
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:54,720
Listen, what...
I mean, what would we do with 18 acres?

261
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,691
I'm gonna be honest with you.

262
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:59,227
The Rosemoor property
has some challenges.

263
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,761
Well, what doesn't?

264
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:06,198
True, but this situation...
I want to offer the word "unique".

265
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:09,837
Wait a second. Is that it?

266
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:12,839
- Yes.
- Rosie.

267
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,241
- And...
- Look.

268
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,696
You don't have
to take a picture, Rosie.

269
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:39,200
Why not?

270
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,960
'Cause we're gonna live here.

271
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:44,266
Mr. Mee, we have to talk, okay?

272
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,308
Let's not rush into things. Let's not...

273
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,570
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Mr. Mee, right now,

274
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,907
I think we're jumpin' the gun.

275
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:56,786
This is exactly what
we've been looking for.

276
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:58,785
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

277
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,789
Let's... Let's just take it all in first.

278
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:04,655
Don't take a gift that's not given
to you yet, now. All right?

279
00:18:04,782 --> 00:18:08,320
This place is perfect.
Why didn't you mention it earlier?

280
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:10,558
Well, that's a bit complicated.

281
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:12,225
Well, complicated's okay.

282
00:18:12,323 --> 00:18:14,803
Complicated can be great.
We love complicated, right?

283
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:17,429
- Mmm-hmm.
- What's so complicated about this place?

284
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:20,838
Well, you see, it's a...

285
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:23,309
it's a...

286
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:25,737
What is it?

287
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:29,080
It has
complications to it, Mr. Mee.

288
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:31,084
- And...

289
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:39,455
it's a zoo.

290
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,525
A zoo?

291
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:45,032
It's a zoo.

292
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:46,968
Yay!

293
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:48,628
Yay.

294
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:58,313
- It was a fully function...

295
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,473
Whoo!

296
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:02,316
- Okay.
- Man.

297
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,552
Totally scary.

298
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,885
This was a fully functioning zoo
until two years ago.

299
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:10,117
Then it was shut down.

300
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:13,127
The estate's been maintaining it
for now, you know, just to keep it up.

301
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:15,527
- Keep it goin', you know?
- Well, I mean, could I, you know,

302
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:17,462
buy the property
and then just relocate the animals?

303
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:20,229
Well, actually, the estate is sellin'
the property with the stipulation

304
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:22,463
that whoever comes on board
and buys the property

305
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,369
is going to care and maintain
these endangered animals.

306
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:25,496
Oh, come on.

307
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,737
And then there's the remaining staff
on board and, you know.

308
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:30,311
If no one buys this property soon,

309
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:33,143
these animals will probably have to be...

310
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:40,013
- Well.
- Well.

311
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:43,058
Thanks. I mean, I don't know
anything about animals and zoos.

312
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,329
- I mean, it's a...
- It is.

313
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:48,663
- It is what it is.
- It is what it is.

314
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:51,534
Sometimes you don't know what it is
until you see what it is.

315
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,034
You know? Once you see what it is,

316
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:55,604
then you can figure out, is it what it is?

317
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:56,899
You understand?

318
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:58,507
- No, but we can move on.
- Yeah.

319
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:02,370
It's just... it's just too bad.

320
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,208
Yeah.

321
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:07,181
- So we keep on lookin'. Right, Rosie?
- Yeah.

322
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,421
Oh, God.

323
00:20:12,543 --> 00:20:16,013
Great, I keep her home from school
one day and she gets eaten!

324
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,528
Ring around the Rosie.

325
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:23,064
Hey, you want some food?

326
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,434
Are you hungry? I think so.

327
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,631
Boy, it's a shame we... We can't just...

328
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,872
You must like it.

329
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,605
I like your feathers.

330
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:41,444
I like yours on your head.
And I like your...

331
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:49,920
I'm gonna live here. I'm gonna keep you.

332
00:20:56,654 --> 00:20:58,827
You look like my brother Dylan.

333
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:01,334
They're gonna...
They're gonna get all your crackers.

334
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,828
I said "human" interaction.

335
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:32,463
This is what happens when people have
a you-know-what occur in their lives.

336
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,467
They wake up one day and they say,

337
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:39,098
"I'm gonna quit my job and try something
completely different with my life."

338
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,904
But then they wake up another day.

339
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,412
And they say to themselves, "Thank God"

340
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:45,777
"my older brother didn't let me blow
Dad's inheritance"

341
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,750
"by buying a broken-down zoo
in the country,"

342
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,821
"nine miles from the nearest Target store."

343
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,787
But maybe my older brother
didn't see this place.

344
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:57,924
<i>- Gracias, Lupe.
- Look.</i>

345
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:00,461
This is... This is simple destiny.

346
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:03,964
The place makes 75% of its revenue
in the summertime.

347
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:06,035
If I can get an inspection
set for the end of June, right?

348
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:07,534
I'll be open by July.

349
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:09,035
It's only February right now.

350
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,468
It's a lot of work, but
I think I can do it.

351
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,432
Duncan, you should have seen Rosie.

352
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:17,104
Look, do... I'm beggin' you,
do what other people do. Go to Vegas.

353
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:18,972
Lose a little bit of money.

354
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,710
Or do what I did, when Sheila left me.

355
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,977
Start handicappin' horses?

356
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:25,020
Well, now, that was a little misguided.

357
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,953
Go into the commercial shrimping
business and call myself Captain Dunk.

358
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:30,889
Start cliff diving in Acapulco
at the age of 38.

359
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:32,392
I miss Sheila, man.

360
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,519
I know, man, I know.

361
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:35,995
All right, forget that.

362
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:40,229
Forget all that. Don't do what I did.
Travel the stages of grief.

363
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:44,966
Yet, stop just before zebras get involved.

364
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:46,370
It's only two zebras.

365
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,310
And a lion. And a jaguar.

366
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,041
And 47 other species,
seven of which are endangered.

367
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,811
And all of them are saved
the second we make this deal.

368
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,387
The kids are gonna be so psyched.

369
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:00,819
- Really? Psyched?
- Yeah.

370
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,585
Are they really gonna be psyched?

371
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:06,027
You're freakin' kidding me! it's a zoo!

372
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:07,528
Well, yeah.

373
00:23:07,618 --> 00:23:11,327
Look, these animals need
somebody to rescue them.

374
00:23:11,422 --> 00:23:13,026
The... The animals need to be...

375
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:15,195
Dad, my friends are here! Our life is here!

376
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:18,399
Whoa! Man, you got expelled! All right?

377
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:20,236
What am I gonna do?
What am I supposed to...

378
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:22,002
- What, I'm gonna home-school you?
- No.

379
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:25,012
Right. So what did we talk about?
A new place.

380
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:26,445
A new start.

381
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,381
This is what you want.
It's not what I want!

382
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:31,218
What?

383
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,453
It's a zoo. I'm moving to a zoo.

384
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:42,688
We bought a zoo!

385
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:46,200
Yes, we did. We did buy a zoo.
Give me some fork.

386
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,897
All right,
let's let this shirt start over!

387
00:23:49,994 --> 00:23:51,735
Okay, two more left.

388
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:55,042
A good one. Oldie but a goodie.
What do you think?

389
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,545
Mommy used to wear that sometimes.

390
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:02,444
She did. This was a...

391
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:05,076
It started out as mine,
but she kind of adopted it.

392
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:06,746
But it's got rips and everything
everywhere.

393
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:11,484
Tough to give some of these
things away, right?

394
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:16,129
- Keep it?
- It's time.

395
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,495
Let that sweatshirt start over.

396
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,964
Let it start over. Okay. This is it.

397
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,471
Last item.

398
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:29,035
- Never. That, we're keeping!
- Okay.

399
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,880
We're here!

400
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:23,392
Okay, look, the Jaguar Restaurant, guys!

401
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:27,658
How great is that?

402
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:57,224
Come on, guys.
Grab a box, man. Go, go get a box.

403
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,194
Hey, this stuff can go to the kitchen.

404
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:05,840
Got it, thank you. Hey, look happy. Smile.

405
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,069
Have you even been inside yet?

406
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:14,405
Okay, guys, this is the whole
storage side of the house!

407
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:17,184
And we got a back door to the kitchen.

408
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,248
Whoo!

409
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:23,349
That is a new smell! Wow!

410
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:26,894
What is that coming from?
Rosie! Come here, look! Dead rats!

411
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:28,554
See, this is all the snake food, right?

412
00:26:28,652 --> 00:26:30,632
I miss our home.

413
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,564
And what we do... Dyl, check this out.

414
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,068
What we do...

415
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:37,367
They're frozen, I guess,
and you feed 'em to the snakes.

416
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:45,175
Right.

417
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:47,977
This is Robin Jones. Peter MacCready.

418
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:50,881
- Yep.
- Robin's our craftsman.

419
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:54,788
And that's Crystal, our capuchin.

420
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,450
And Peter is our visionary.

421
00:26:57,581 --> 00:26:59,390
He built the enclosures
that set the standards

422
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:01,793
for modern zoos all across America.

423
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,296
And the world.

424
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,059
Yeah, and the world, yes.

425
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:09,127
And Peter and Robin do...
Well, they basically do everything.

426
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,637
Except for the books and the telephone.

427
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:12,172
That's Rhonda over there.

428
00:27:14,598 --> 00:27:17,408
This is my cousin Lily. She's 13.
She can't legally work here,

429
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:20,345
so we pay her cash under the table
out of my salary.

430
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:22,144
- Hi, Lily.
- She's being home-schooled.

431
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,650
She lives on the property.

432
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:26,814
Works at the Jaguar. That's it.

433
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:28,981
It's just us, Mr. Mee.

434
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:32,959
Well, it's great to meet all of you.
I'm Benjamin.

435
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:36,625
This is Rosie, my daughter.

436
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:42,763
And my big boy, Dylan. And our dog, Leon.

437
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,363
And this is our zoo now, I guess.

438
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,007
And...

439
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:51,445
Love the house, smells and all. Right?

440
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,945
So I would like to declare us all
modern-day adventurers.

441
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:04,450
And sponsors of animal greatness.

442
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,697
Okay, terrific. Let's go.

443
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:14,336
- Dad?
"Yep, got it"

444
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:20,201
Can we see the otters?
I'd love to see the otters.

445
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,641
And the snakes, and the monkeys.

446
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,805
How old are you?

447
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:28,042
Fourteen, I guess.

448
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,742
So, when you get a second,
there's a couple things

449
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,254
I need to go over with you
about the upcoming inspection.

450
00:28:34,378 --> 00:28:36,915
Yeah, the USDA inspector, Walt Ferris.

451
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:38,424
I'll kill him.

452
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:40,256
MacCready, stop.

453
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:51,934
This is Buster. He's our
650-pound North American grizzly.

454
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:55,941
He was 770, but...
But he's been stressed out.

455
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:59,047
You know, he's moody. We had him
on Paxil, but can't afford it.

456
00:28:59,136 --> 00:29:01,013
So he's occasionally depressed.

457
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:02,778
He can still rip your arm off, though.

458
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,377
Hey, there, Buster.
Are you missin' the meds?

459
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:08,218
- Whoa.

460
00:29:10,314 --> 00:29:11,884
This is Nathan. He does our water and feed.

461
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:13,427
- Hey, good to meet you.
- Hi.

462
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,032
Talkin' to the animals has to be
done in a super specific way.

463
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:20,864
You know, he doesn't have it yet,
but he'll learn.

464
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:24,103
Where'd you get your shoes?

465
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:26,708
And how much did they cost?

466
00:29:26,797 --> 00:29:28,572
You know, we have one Target
and it's nine...

467
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,146
Wait. Wait! Wait, wait!

468
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:51,256
I thought they would roar
like Solomon the Lion.

469
00:29:52,489 --> 00:29:54,935
No, tigers and lions are very different.

470
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:57,631
Tigers don't growl or roar, they chuff.

471
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:58,963
Like...

472
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,138
- Yeah.

473
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:05,975
When you chuff at them,
they chuff back, see?

474
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:16,614
Try, go on.

475
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:22,059
Oh, my God.

476
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,322
That guy there, that's Spar.

477
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:26,833
He's our eldest. He's 17.
He's a Bengal tiger.

478
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,395
You know, tigers have special sensors

479
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,564
in the front of their two-inch canines.

480
00:30:31,695 --> 00:30:33,732
They can actually detect
the pulse in your aorta.

481
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:35,400
So when they attack, they bite you,

482
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:37,534
take your pulse with their teeth,

483
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:40,376
reposition those suckers and boom,
there goes your carotid.

484
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:41,572
Wow.

485
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:42,740
Yeah.

486
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:47,013
So there's a few decisions

487
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,182
you'll have to make straightaway, Ben.

488
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,020
Benjamin. Ben was my dad.

489
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:55,023
Spar, who you just met, the tiger?
He's gonna need some special care,

490
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,656
so we have a large animal vet
coming from San Diego.

491
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,428
It's just that he's a fortune
to get here and...

492
00:30:59,556 --> 00:31:01,536
That's okay, I'll pay.

493
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,996
Well, no, he... He's also very old,

494
00:31:04,094 --> 00:31:06,597
so the truth is, we don't really know
how much longer he's got and I...

495
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,835
Just set it up. What else do we have?

496
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:10,811
Rickety posts.

497
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,573
Beak rot in the tortoises.

498
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:14,706
A weak enclosure between
the jaguars and the tigers.

499
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:16,546
They don't get along. We've...

500
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,382
Okay, why don't we start with the posts.

501
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,452
- Okay, the posts.
- The posts in the cages?

502
00:31:21,578 --> 00:31:22,989
The posts in what?

503
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,294
Look, they're not called cages,
they're called enclosures.

504
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,987
They haven't been called cages
in like a century.

505
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:30,229
My brief marriage, that was a cage.

506
00:31:30,454 --> 00:31:31,933
Not mine.

507
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:36,265
I have a question for you.

508
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:39,402
You're some random guy from the city.

509
00:31:39,496 --> 00:31:41,942
No one in the zoo community
has ever heard of you.

510
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:43,978
You know nothing about animals.

511
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:45,478
And you've moved into a dump.

512
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:48,515
I mean, what kind of regular person
just up and buys a place like this?

513
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:51,078
Especially somebody with kids. Why?

514
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:56,082
You have no idea
what we've been dealing with here.

515
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,591
We used to have three times the staff.

516
00:31:57,681 --> 00:31:58,819
They all quit.

517
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:00,826
I'm 28. I never go out.

518
00:32:00,951 --> 00:32:02,294
I'm here every day.

519
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:03,922
My girlfriends, they text me,

520
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:06,126
they're out livin' their lives,
meeting guys named Brett,

521
00:32:06,223 --> 00:32:07,361
and I'm here shovellin' shit.

522
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:08,697
Bear shit!

523
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,328
I'm pathetic!

524
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,099
I had to move back in with my mother.

525
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:13,801
No one gets paid, Ben...

526
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:15,109
...jamin.

527
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:17,175
We need somebody who can
really take charge of this place

528
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:20,282
or else we and all these animals are gone.

529
00:32:23,874 --> 00:32:25,547
So your question is?

530
00:32:27,077 --> 00:32:28,818
Why did you buy this place?

531
00:32:40,757 --> 00:32:42,065
Why not?

532
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,774
You comin'?

533
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:33,777
Oh, my God! This is so fun!

534
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:05,480
...would you sleep
with this man?

535
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:10,115
- No! Kelly, would you sleep with this man?

536
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,468
He doesn't walk with lions.

537
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:24,164
He never cheated the Wall of Death!

538
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:25,706
- No, that's true.
- He...

539
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:27,233
Hey!

540
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,304
It's the most dangerous animal
in the forest.

541
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:33,642
The adult boomer male.

542
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:35,344
Well done!

543
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:36,509
Yah!

544
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,343
Walter Ferris. I'll kill him!

545
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,418
I will, I'll kill him.

546
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:46,027
I'll cut off his head with a sword.

547
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:47,891
I'll kill him without a thought.

548
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:53,734
And he stole $500 from me,

549
00:34:53,857 --> 00:34:55,564
back in the 1980s!

550
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:57,999
He's a crook!

551
00:34:58,095 --> 00:34:59,199
Hi, Benjamin!

552
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:00,673
Your chair, sir.

553
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:08,113
He stole all of my ideas.
And he gave them to the...

554
00:35:08,238 --> 00:35:09,774
Sloane Animal Park.

555
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,682
Sloane Animal Park!

556
00:35:14,978 --> 00:35:17,754
My visions! My waste canals!

557
00:35:17,881 --> 00:35:18,951
My...

558
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,721
- Moats?
- My moats!

559
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:22,791
And they shut us down.

560
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:26,193
- Okay.
- These are the thieves

561
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,232
of the spirit.

562
00:35:28,325 --> 00:35:29,463
Oh, MacCready.

563
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:30,936
MacCready's gettin' deep tonight!

564
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:32,472
Yeah! Deep!

565
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:34,303
Deep inside, too!

566
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:36,377
Here you go, boss.

567
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,946
Welcome to your zoo, Benjamin Mee.

568
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:39,646
Thank you.

569
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:45,618
He'll never last.

570
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,262
Hey, guys.

571
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,707
You are gonna love your new enclosure.

572
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,176
- Whoa, okay, hey, hey. Hey, all right.

573
00:36:11,301 --> 00:36:12,473
Whoa! Whoa!

574
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:14,873
Not bad. Actually, they're...
They're pretty docile.

575
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:16,343
Not at night.

576
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:21,182
You like to get a little
wild at night, huh?

577
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:22,551
You get a little crazy.

578
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,283
A little crazy nighttime for the...

579
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,491
Oh, man!

580
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:34,796
- You all right, boss?
- Oh, man!

581
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,231
Listen, you're not
talkin' to 'em correctly, yet, boss.

582
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,502
You gotta be real with 'em.

583
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:43,874
I'm never talkin'
to you again, you little asshole!

584
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:46,477
Now you're talkin' to 'em.
There you go.

585
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,185
It's great. I get it.

586
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,119
This whole spiritual journey or whatever.

587
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:55,884
You know, we're all in cages, man.

588
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,882
I love it. But,

589
00:36:58,615 --> 00:37:01,755
at the risk of stating the obvious,
you're insane. Okay?

590
00:37:02,352 --> 00:37:03,831
You're drilling yourself into

591
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,332
insane debt!

592
00:37:05,422 --> 00:37:06,423
You good?

593
00:37:06,556 --> 00:37:07,899
Yeah, all good. Thanks.

594
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:10,063
Who's that?

595
00:37:10,694 --> 00:37:11,729
That's Kelly.

596
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,109
Holy shit. Okay.

597
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:15,710
Here's the revised Duncan plan.

598
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:17,574
Dump the animals. Keep Kelly.

599
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:19,078
That's true joy

600
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:23,410
it's about Rosie, man.

601
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,746
She is happy here.

602
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,047
Rosie is seven.

603
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:29,886
Just make her a nice zoo screen saver
and she'll be just as happy.

604
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:35,089
Look. I'm tryin' to give 'em
an authentic American experience.

605
00:37:35,185 --> 00:37:37,665
And it ends with you authentically living

606
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,598
on my veloured couch
with your two children.

607
00:37:41,024 --> 00:37:44,403
I see you working in a field, in Bolivia,

608
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:48,265
for angry men. With large mustaches.

609
00:37:48,365 --> 00:37:49,844
- Hey, back off.

610
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:02,653
What ya doin'?

611
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,421
You want a sandwich?

612
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:10,361
No. That's okay.

613
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:20,664
How'd you get the nosebleed?

614
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,440
I slipped on the roof and banged it.

615
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:27,809
It's a weird house.

616
00:38:27,904 --> 00:38:29,542
Yeah.

617
00:38:33,543 --> 00:38:34,783
I like your drawing.

618
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:40,494
Thanks.

619
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,898
It's a little dark.

620
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:54,140
Where's the sun?

621
00:38:55,365 --> 00:38:57,811
There's no sun in the underworld.

622
00:38:58,902 --> 00:39:00,677
That I'm aware of.

623
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:09,220
- I'm off at 4:00.
- Cool.

624
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:14,427
So I'll come back every day at 4:15
and bring you a sandwich.

625
00:39:15,218 --> 00:39:16,356
Okay.

626
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:18,423
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye.

627
00:39:22,926 --> 00:39:26,874
Mr. Mae? We've got the bill
from the feed company.

628
00:39:26,963 --> 00:39:30,103
It's a little high, 'cause somebody
had them deliver on a Saturday.

629
00:40:08,772 --> 00:40:10,217
Hi.

630
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:32,231
<i>More bad news.</i>

631
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:35,071
Sorry. And I'd go to the
Target if you want.

632
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:37,611
I'm not sure if all Dwyer's clothes fit him

633
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:40,181
Dylan. His name's Dylan.
His clothes are fine.

634
00:40:40,303 --> 00:40:43,750
And I just have to say
that I love this job.

635
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,844
But I keep getting calls on
the overdrafts on these checks.

636
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,581
You're three weeks overdue
on the purchase...

637
00:40:51,815 --> 00:40:54,762
Hey, guys. I forgot to buy butter.

638
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:00,525
How important is butter
to this meal tonight?

639
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:02,599
We're gonna take a vote.

640
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:03,932
And remember,

641
00:41:04,027 --> 00:41:07,270
it's nine miles each way
to the grocery store.

642
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:09,807
Nine miles.

643
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,380
Nine miles there. Nine miles back.

644
00:41:12,502 --> 00:41:15,813
So I think the question we need to
ask ourselves as a family

645
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:19,444
is butter worth your dad driving 18 miles

646
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,523
right now to get it?

647
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:24,491
Let's vote.

648
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,324
Long day for you, Ben?

649
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:32,661
Long day for you.

650
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,633
You should go home.
We'll take over. We're good.

651
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:35,794
Corn's ready!

652
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,033
Eighteen miles for butter.

653
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:42,137
But I'm just tellin' Kelly here
that she's gotta...

654
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,170
She's gotta go have some time to herself.

655
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:47,180
So, just tell me what, you know,
just give me a list of what to do,

656
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,908
- and I'll do it.
- Are you sure?

657
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,541
Yeah, we got it.

658
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,847
Okay. Spar has a...

659
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,583
A new medication, so let me just...

660
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:58,190
Make sure that this gets in his food

661
00:41:58,281 --> 00:41:59,521
- and that he eats it all.
- Okay.

662
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:01,653
Turn off the lights in the garage.

663
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:03,253
The garage.

664
00:42:03,386 --> 00:42:05,388
There is a new shipment of exotic snakes,

665
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:07,024
so just leave them in the travel crates

666
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:08,659
and I'll put them in the exhibit
in the morning.

667
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,229
And the monkeys need fruit as well.

668
00:42:12,362 --> 00:42:13,363
Go home.

669
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:14,874
Go out.

670
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,411
Go to the city. Go find your girlfriends.

671
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:21,210
I think I'll just find my pillow.

672
00:42:21,304 --> 00:42:23,113
- All right, good night.
- Night.

673
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,418
Oh! That thing.

674
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:28,887
You wanted me to remember that thing,

675
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,049
- and I...
- Go home.

676
00:42:30,146 --> 00:42:31,682
Okay.

677
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,145
Nine point two miles.

678
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:02,781
So, technically, that's
18.4 miles for butter.

679
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,890
You know I found some, right?

680
00:43:07,617 --> 00:43:08,789
All right, so Rosie and I'll

681
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:11,792
go to the tiger enclosure
and give them some water.

682
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:13,400
Why don't you just go over to the garage

683
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,094
and make sure the lights are off
in the side room?

684
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:17,034
Dad, I have a sick amount
of homework tonight.

685
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:19,565
Dad!

686
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,074
Get it done!

687
00:43:28,738 --> 00:43:30,649
Come on, Spar, you gotta take your meds.

688
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:38,553
He looks tired, Dad.

689
00:43:38,915 --> 00:43:40,417
He's gonna be okay.

690
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:43,058
Isn't that right, buddy?

691
00:43:45,488 --> 00:43:47,661
See that? He likes us.

692
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,433
Dylan really loves you, you know?

693
00:43:58,301 --> 00:43:59,405
I know.

694
00:43:59,502 --> 00:44:02,312
He's just mad that
his friends don't visit him here.

695
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:05,909
He thought they would all visit.
But nobody came.

696
00:44:17,687 --> 00:44:19,132
Well, they will.

697
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:25,562
Ugh!

698
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:53,734
Ugh!

699
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:07,309
Could you possibly
point another fan at me?

700
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:09,816
You have three fans blowing on you.

701
00:45:09,906 --> 00:45:11,579
I like it.

702
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:14,052
I can't even find you in there.
You're like a Chilean miner.

703
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,186
We're gonna have to go get

704
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:19,385
Kelly and maybe even get MacCready.

705
00:45:20,283 --> 00:45:22,388
Dig you out. My goodness.
There, it's Miss...

706
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,328
- Nobody else.
- There's Rosie.

707
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,763
- Was that a laugh?

708
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:30,536
What? Oh, no! Aha!

709
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:33,904
Don't... Don't look now.
You're happy. Ha ha!

710
00:45:34,764 --> 00:45:36,573
Your happy is too loud?

711
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:39,339
Uh-oh! Whose happy is loud?

712
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:44,777
Now what do we have here?

713
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,114
It's our old friend.

714
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,549
I didn't think this one was gonna
make the trip.

715
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,920
Did Mama hurt a lot
before she had to leave us?

716
00:45:58,221 --> 00:46:00,360
Well...

717
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,534
Well, do you remember

718
00:46:04,627 --> 00:46:07,733
the night that we were tucking you in,

719
00:46:07,864 --> 00:46:09,775
and you asked Mommy that?

720
00:46:09,899 --> 00:46:11,742
- No?
- No.

721
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:14,678
Well, she said...

722
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,578
She said that it looked worse than it felt.

723
00:46:19,242 --> 00:46:21,882
Remember? She said sometimes
people look really sick

724
00:46:21,978 --> 00:46:23,924
but they don't feel really sick.

725
00:46:25,882 --> 00:46:28,055
Do you feel like you can't see her?

726
00:46:28,151 --> 00:46:29,528
Yeah.

727
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:31,223
And you feel like you can't hear her voice?

728
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,198
Uh-huh. But I know what to do.

729
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:34,734
Catch her spirit.

730
00:46:34,824 --> 00:46:36,269
Catch her spirit. That's right.

731
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:39,432
- Here it comes.
- Okay, look for it.

732
00:46:39,562 --> 00:46:40,632
There you go.

733
00:46:40,763 --> 00:46:42,709
And put it in your heart.

734
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,073
It fell. Okay, get it.

735
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:47,972
Hold it there.

736
00:46:48,104 --> 00:46:50,084
- Can you see her?
- Yeah.

737
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:51,151
Yeah?

738
00:46:53,276 --> 00:46:55,085
She's never far away.

739
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:57,749
- Right there.
- That's right.

740
00:46:57,847 --> 00:47:00,384
Mommy would always be
in your heart and my shoulder.

741
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:05,758
Are you ready to go to bed?

742
00:47:06,322 --> 00:47:08,427
Do you want to... Do you want to keep this?

743
00:47:10,293 --> 00:47:11,897
Okay.

744
00:47:13,696 --> 00:47:15,300
Okay, sweetheart.

745
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:17,777
Good night.

746
00:47:23,506 --> 00:47:25,179
Goldfish, I have.

747
00:47:25,308 --> 00:47:27,310
Cereal bar for you. You're late, dude.

748
00:47:27,443 --> 00:47:29,923
Did you even read that book? Man...

749
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:33,961
You're funny with everyone else,
but never with me, which I find funny.

750
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,927
Well, you know what I find funny?

751
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,965
I gotta drive you 40,000 miles to school.

752
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:39,624
Here you go, one, two. There you go.

753
00:47:39,722 --> 00:47:41,963
And don't think I don't notice
you just changed the subject.

754
00:47:42,058 --> 00:47:43,264
Dylan likes Lily.

755
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,430
Please, she's way younger than me.
She's 12.

756
00:47:45,528 --> 00:47:47,030
It doesn't work like that.

757
00:47:47,163 --> 00:47:48,506
She's about a foot taller.

758
00:47:48,631 --> 00:47:50,372
Don't be a tiny person.

759
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,608
- I'm an idiot.
- Dude!

760
00:47:58,141 --> 00:47:59,643
I'll call Kelly.

761
00:48:05,214 --> 00:48:07,216
This one seems really not happy with me.

762
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,057
- You got a big guy there.
- Yeah.

763
00:48:09,185 --> 00:48:10,664
We live on a snake farm!

764
00:48:10,753 --> 00:48:12,699
Okay. That's a... Whoa. Come on.

765
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:14,733
- Wow. Wow. Wow.

766
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:17,501
Yeah, I'm... Funny, funny.

767
00:48:18,261 --> 00:48:20,070
Glad you guys are enjoyin' yourselves.

768
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,840
I mean, how could this even happen, man?
I don't even know how you did this!

769
00:48:23,933 --> 00:48:25,378
Dad, there's nothin' you could say to me

770
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:27,174
that's more harsh than
what I'm sayin' to myself!

771
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,476
Well, I disagree!

772
00:48:29,038 --> 00:48:30,813
I just want you to be happy, man.

773
00:48:31,107 --> 00:48:32,711
Unless you don't want to be happy.

774
00:48:32,842 --> 00:48:34,822
What is so great about being happy?

775
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,254
That you're happy.

776
00:48:37,113 --> 00:48:39,320
I'm sorry I messed up the box of snakes.

777
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,585
Whatever!

778
00:48:44,854 --> 00:48:46,595
You're not supposed
to say that in this century.

779
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:48,669
He's so patronizing to me!

780
00:48:48,758 --> 00:48:50,897
- Nice word, hotshot!
- Yeah!

781
00:48:51,027 --> 00:48:52,438
Whatever!

782
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,416
Now you'll notice here
that I am stringing this cable

783
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:07,248
right near the hock, right near the center.

784
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:10,153
So I'm gonna have you
string up this carcass in a tree.

785
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:13,157
It's good for the tigers to feel like
they're searching for their food

786
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:14,523
like they do in the wild.

787
00:49:15,518 --> 00:49:16,588
Awesome.

788
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,862
Hey, I'm pretty sure
this is none of my business,

789
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:23,267
but I noticed that
your kid really pushes your buttons.

790
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,762
You give him a lot of rope.

791
00:49:27,096 --> 00:49:29,667
I did not appreciate the way
he kicked that garter snake.

792
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,239
Hey, wait, I feel like I should be
helping you here.

793
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:34,780
It's all good.

794
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:39,383
Yeah, look, he's 14,
and he went through somethin'

795
00:49:39,475 --> 00:49:41,546
that no kid should ever have to go through,

796
00:49:42,478 --> 00:49:44,014
so I'm givin' him a little bit of leeway.

797
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:46,420
Look, honestly, I don't know.

798
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:50,087
I'm tryin' to figure it out.
There's no manual for what happened.

799
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,132
I mean, a minute ago,
he was into paper airplanes,

800
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:55,702
and now he's into
portraits of decapitations.

801
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,971
- And they're really good.
- Yeah, well,

802
00:49:59,462 --> 00:50:00,941
what do I know?
I still live with my mother.

803
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:02,600
I'm not good with people.

804
00:50:05,835 --> 00:50:07,576
You're doing very well.

805
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:10,116
You know, I expected you to be
heading for the hills by now.

806
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,913
Well, we got through today.

807
00:50:12,742 --> 00:50:14,187
Yeah, we got through today.

808
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:23,794
Mayday, mayday! Kelly, do you copy?

809
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,391
- Full alert!
- Copy, full alert

810
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:27,593
Contain the dark lord.

811
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:28,668
It's Walter Ferris.

812
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:31,165
But no, no, no, no.
He's supposed to come

813
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:32,602
a week before we open for the inspection.

814
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:34,834
Well, it looks like he's decided to
pay a hello visit.

815
00:50:34,964 --> 00:50:36,841
Yeah, but we're not even close to ready.

816
00:50:36,966 --> 00:50:38,343
Look, just be yourself.

817
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:39,811
This is life or death, man.

818
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,347
Okay, got it.

819
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:44,451
Keep MacCready away from him.
We don't need any bloodshed today.

820
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,883
- Let me out of here!
- I'm sorry, MacCready!

821
00:50:45,975 --> 00:50:47,545
The door seems to be stuck!

822
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,343
Benjamin Mee.

823
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,943
- Walter Ferris.
- Pleasure.

824
00:51:15,037 --> 00:51:17,017
Our inspection happens

825
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:20,313
a week before we open,
according to my information.

826
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:22,548
So I've asked for June 30th, which would

827
00:51:22,678 --> 00:51:25,215
get us open by July 7th. 7!?

828
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:29,057
I'm here for a pop by, Mr. Mee.

829
00:51:30,152 --> 00:51:32,359
Great. Let's schedule a pop by.

830
00:51:32,488 --> 00:51:35,367
We've only just
really arrived here, Mr. Ferris.

831
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:40,001
A pop by, Mr. Mee,
is, by its very definition, a surprise.

832
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,866
I'll be taking notes in preparation
for the actual inspection.

833
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:43,977
As will I.

834
00:51:46,435 --> 00:51:50,315
Now, we're responsible for the upkeep,
not just the granting of licenses.

835
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:55,052
Welcome to the business of
live-animal maintenance, Mr. Mee.

836
00:51:55,177 --> 00:51:57,179
It's a real fun party.

837
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:58,817
Where's your zookeeper?

838
00:52:00,082 --> 00:52:01,686
That's me. Kelly.

839
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,864
Hello, Kelly.

840
00:52:07,523 --> 00:52:09,161
I have you down as an assistant.

841
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:11,365
No formal training?

842
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,598
I moved up.

843
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,036
Oh!

844
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:18,541
Now why would you buy this place?

845
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:21,915
I just can't get

846
00:52:23,572 --> 00:52:25,017
a handle on it.

847
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:30,451
Wow.

848
00:52:46,629 --> 00:52:47,664
You know, actually,

849
00:52:47,763 --> 00:52:49,037
quite a lot's been written about

850
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:51,112
the innovative design of these enclosures

851
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,406
built by Peter MacCready.

852
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:53,843
I know all about MacCready.

853
00:52:54,637 --> 00:52:56,241
I've been coming here long before you.

854
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,747
And I know what's in the Jaguar, too.

855
00:53:20,563 --> 00:53:22,804
You're eight inches short.

856
00:53:22,932 --> 00:53:24,275
That's regulation.

857
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,936
New guidelines are being raised this year.

858
00:53:27,136 --> 00:53:29,047
Raise the barrier heights, too.

859
00:53:29,972 --> 00:53:32,043
I'd make that first priority, as well.

860
00:53:35,444 --> 00:53:37,617
I see one of these tigers
is 17 years of age?

861
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:40,193
Yeah, that's Spar, right here.
He had a recent bout

862
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:41,921
with kidney disease.
That's in remission now.

863
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:44,396
We're just dealin' with
a little bit of hip dysplasia.

864
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:46,967
Have you begun to
draw up an end-of-life plan?

865
00:53:47,456 --> 00:53:50,027
Part of the humane care of an animal
is preparing for the inevitable...

866
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:51,605
He's fine.

867
00:53:51,694 --> 00:53:53,571
We had the vet come out from San Diego,
took a look at him.

868
00:53:53,662 --> 00:53:55,141
So we're all good there.

869
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:58,473
The endgame on a big cat
can be very costly.

870
00:53:58,601 --> 00:54:00,581
I understand, but we're not there yet.

871
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:01,944
Thank you for your concern.

872
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:05,144
I guess I just don't understand
how you can call this place home.

873
00:54:05,274 --> 00:54:07,686
You know what? Like this. it's our home.

874
00:54:11,647 --> 00:54:13,593
Where is my old friend MacCready?

875
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:21,535
Where is Ferris?

876
00:54:26,028 --> 00:54:28,838
Okay, he gave us 12 top-priority items,

877
00:54:28,964 --> 00:54:30,375
two medium-priority. We have one month.

878
00:54:30,499 --> 00:54:31,603
How much of this
can we get done in a month?

879
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,804
I'll kill him!

880
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,176
Ferris!

881
00:54:35,304 --> 00:54:36,977
I mean, how much is this gonna cost?

882
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:38,780
I'm gonna have to go take a look around.

883
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,219
You know, go through it
in an itemized way, but,

884
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,722
I mean, you're gonna have to
put some more skin in the game, boss.

885
00:54:43,846 --> 00:54:45,291
How much?

886
00:54:48,984 --> 00:54:50,725
I'd say you're lookin' at
about a buck fifty here.

887
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,294
- Maybe a buck.
- Okay.

888
00:54:55,758 --> 00:54:57,135
A dollar fifty?

889
00:54:57,226 --> 00:54:58,534
I have that.

890
00:54:59,695 --> 00:55:01,299
Good, go get it. We're gonna need it.

891
00:55:01,397 --> 00:55:02,967
Good.

892
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,304
Okay.

893
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:08,245
Okay. Okay.

894
00:55:08,871 --> 00:55:10,316
Okay.

895
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,821
I'm just gonna take a little walk
and wrap my brain around this one.

896
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:22,727
Well,

897
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:24,754
Ferris lusts you.

898
00:55:26,255 --> 00:55:28,531
I'm not takin' one for the team,
if that's what you're gettin' after.

899
00:55:28,624 --> 00:55:30,661
I'm not gettin' after anything like that.

900
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,171
No way.

901
00:55:35,097 --> 00:55:37,270
It's a shame about the new boss, huh?

902
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,846
He just got here and he's
already thinkin' of quittin'.

903
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,506
Why are you saying that?

904
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:49,121
That is the posture of a quittin' man.

905
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:55,119
Ferris, that son of a bitch!

906
00:55:56,285 --> 00:55:57,423
Wow.

907
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,093
It's the wrong day
for this to be happening, man.

908
00:56:34,223 --> 00:56:35,896
I got your sister home sick from school.

909
00:56:36,759 --> 00:56:38,705
And you, I mean...

910
00:56:39,261 --> 00:56:42,105
How do they send someone home early
for moodiness?

911
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:45,144
I don't know. it's a sensitive school.

912
00:57:13,762 --> 00:57:15,139
Buster?

913
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,883
Dyl, can you hand me my phone?

914
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:31,553
It is in the center console.

915
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:33,759
Got it.

916
00:57:43,025 --> 00:57:45,266
Kelly. Benjamin.

917
00:57:48,664 --> 00:57:51,076
Full and total lockdown! Buster!

918
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,474
We're comin' up the foothill.

919
00:57:52,568 --> 00:57:54,070
He's off the street
and up in the woods!

920
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:55,147
Buster!

921
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:04,787
I'll take this side of the hill!

922
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,484
I called the vet from San Diego!

923
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:09,152
He'll be here with the big van,
but it'll be expensive!

924
00:58:09,284 --> 00:58:10,661
I'll pay whatever it takes!

925
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:13,323
We can't handle the publicity
of an escape! It'll ruin us.

926
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:17,302
Buster! I know you're out there!
Buster!

927
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,669
Buster!

928
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,653
Hey, Buster.

929
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:38,318
Let's just hang out.

930
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:40,018
Pretend we're at the zoo.

931
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,924
Buster, this is a big gun
and I don't want to shoot you.

932
00:58:47,956 --> 00:58:49,299
Holy shit.

933
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:09,812
- You got a shot?
- I've got one.

934
00:59:09,912 --> 00:59:11,858
He's been hit by a powerful tranquillizer!

935
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,484
Don't move, Mr. Mee!
He might be faking it.

936
00:59:14,883 --> 00:59:16,954
Way to go, Mr. Mee!

937
00:59:17,953 --> 00:59:19,261
I got him.

938
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,096
That's how
you talk to him, Benjamin.

939
00:59:21,557 --> 00:59:22,968
Yeah, Kelly Foster.

940
00:59:23,058 --> 00:59:24,469
Ben contained him, so he's fine.

941
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,369
He was toyin' with you, my boy.

942
00:59:26,495 --> 00:59:28,998
That's what they do
before you become chips and salsa.

943
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,904
I saw him up here on the hill
by himself. Utterly free.

944
00:59:34,336 --> 00:59:36,213
You were blessed.

945
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:39,084
I want to make his enclosure bigger.

946
00:59:40,075 --> 00:59:42,248
- Bigger?
- Bigger, we need it much bigger.

947
00:59:42,377 --> 00:59:44,254
Well, you're the man.

948
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:50,562
You're the man who just stared down
a 750-pound North American grizzly.

949
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:58,198
It looks like Buster is gonna be okay.

950
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:01,098
I take Visa. I prefer MasterCard.

951
01:00:43,405 --> 01:00:44,782
To Benjamin.

952
01:00:46,508 --> 01:00:47,919
Our local hero.

953
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:51,219
- Benjamin! Yeah!
- Mr. Mee!

954
01:00:53,415 --> 01:00:56,157
Stupidest thing I've ever done. Thank you.

955
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,641
I love that you were
named after Bob Dylan.

956
01:01:16,004 --> 01:01:17,415
Bob Dylan.

957
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:25,357
You hear that sound?
Those are lemurs.

958
01:01:25,447 --> 01:01:29,224
They're primates, they sound like
people laughing in the distance.

959
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:30,763
They freak me out.

960
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:33,094
You sound like a lemur.

961
01:01:33,555 --> 01:01:34,556
What?

962
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:37,160
I'm worried Lily's gonna hurt Dylan.

963
01:01:37,292 --> 01:01:40,171
No, it's gonna be the other way around.

964
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:42,673
Well, how do you figure that?

965
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:45,938
'Cause she's a farm girl, Ben... jamin.

966
01:01:46,034 --> 01:01:48,173
And,

967
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:52,116
he's like this exotic
creature from the city.

968
01:01:52,207 --> 01:01:55,620
- Exotic? My son?
Yes.

969
01:01:57,646 --> 01:02:01,093
I was afraid you thought
he was a little bit of a jerk.

970
01:02:03,385 --> 01:02:06,423
I'm guessing that Rosie was more like
your wife and Dylan's more like you

971
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:08,159
and that's why you're so hard on him.

972
01:02:12,294 --> 01:02:15,707
I want you to know,
I think you're incredibly pretty.

973
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:19,945
Please, don't take offense
if I don't hit on you.

974
01:02:20,035 --> 01:02:21,514
I'd be offended if you did.

975
01:02:22,571 --> 01:02:23,549
Good.

976
01:02:23,672 --> 01:02:25,674
I'm a big fan of people
being exactly who they are.

977
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:27,617
- Exactly.
- So we think alike.

978
01:02:27,709 --> 01:02:28,710
We do.

979
01:02:28,844 --> 01:02:30,983
And if I wanted to be kissed by you,
you wouldn't have a choice.

980
01:02:32,514 --> 01:02:34,619
Thank you. I think.

981
01:02:34,716 --> 01:02:36,457
I don't doubt that.

982
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:38,725
- What did we just say?
- I don't know.

983
01:02:38,854 --> 01:02:40,390
Okay.

984
01:02:49,264 --> 01:02:51,505
It's a lot to take on. All of us.

985
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,708
I'll see you tomorrow, right?

986
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:43,585
<i>It hurts me to tell you this.</i>

987
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:46,165
I've been checking his bills.

988
01:03:46,254 --> 01:03:48,256
The zoo account is empty.

989
01:03:49,024 --> 01:03:53,564
He has no more money.
He has no idea what he's doing.

990
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:58,941
He is going to end up selling
this place to somebody for cheap.

991
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:00,569
For the land alone.

992
01:04:00,702 --> 01:04:02,181
That's right, Robin!

993
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:04,246
I am warning you now.

994
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:08,081
Behind that front is a front!

995
01:04:09,211 --> 01:04:12,556
Benjamin Mee is a fraud!

996
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:17,393
- Hey.
- What else you got?

997
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:19,227
It's a bad idea. Let me call you back.

998
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:22,029
You gotta look at this.
She left a deposit slip.

999
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:23,933
And it led me to that.

1000
01:04:24,893 --> 01:04:26,702
Let's go.

1001
01:04:39,474 --> 01:04:40,578
Do you know what she did for you?

1002
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,714
I think so.

1003
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:45,621
She knew exactly what you would do.

1004
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:48,254
You'd make a bad investment,
need to start over,

1005
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:49,795
and have to have a cushion.

1006
01:04:50,852 --> 01:04:52,627
This is your cushion.

1007
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:55,968
- $84,000, man.
- Oh, my God.

1008
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:58,002
$84,000.

1009
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:01,271
It's unbelievable.

1010
01:05:01,363 --> 01:05:04,071
She's still lookin' out for you, man.

1011
01:05:10,038 --> 01:05:11,108
She calls it your circus money.

1012
01:05:11,206 --> 01:05:12,742
Circus money, yeah.

1013
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:17,082
- This next part's kind of hurtful.
- Yeah.

1014
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,181
It says, "Listen to your heart,
not your brother."

1015
01:05:19,314 --> 01:05:20,918
I know, I read that. She loved you, man.

1016
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:23,326
She used three exclamation marks.

1017
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:24,487
She loved you.

1018
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:27,467
Well, I can see why you
still carry the torch.

1019
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:30,332
Yeah, but with $84,000,
we'll cut a few corners,

1020
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,029
but I know we can make the inspection.

1021
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:34,001
No, Benji.

1022
01:05:34,329 --> 01:05:35,865
Here's what she's saying.

1023
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:39,105
You're free. You realize that.

1024
01:05:40,402 --> 01:05:42,382
Listen.

1025
01:05:42,504 --> 01:05:43,881
Benji.

1026
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:47,476
You did it, man. You went to the circus.

1027
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,419
You changed Dylan and Rosie's lives.

1028
01:05:49,511 --> 01:05:51,923
They're gonna have
those memories forever.

1029
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:55,461
But staying here and going down in flames,

1030
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:59,498
that's not what Katherine wanted.
She wanted you to be free.

1031
01:06:00,522 --> 01:06:03,230
This money is your ticket out.

1032
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:06,862
And if you won't listen to your brother,
the accountant,

1033
01:06:07,262 --> 01:06:08,707
then listen to your wife

1034
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:13,243
who clearly planned
a financial future for you.

1035
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:16,547
Okay.

1036
01:06:18,173 --> 01:06:19,550
Here.

1037
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:22,220
Thanks.

1038
01:06:29,851 --> 01:06:31,888
I hear you may not be
staying here much longer.

1039
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:33,892
Seriously?

1040
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:36,434
Yeah.

1041
01:06:39,127 --> 01:06:43,576
But if you still want to befriends,
you know, I'll still be your friend.

1042
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,039
I mean, there are still cars and all.

1043
01:06:47,135 --> 01:06:48,842
Well, yeah, of course,

1044
01:06:48,937 --> 01:06:50,712
but are you for real with this?

1045
01:06:55,977 --> 01:06:59,424
Oh, yes! This is fantastic.

1046
01:07:00,615 --> 01:07:02,117
I'm goin' home.

1047
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:05,190
See my friends.

1048
01:07:10,392 --> 01:07:12,372
Hey, listen, I gotta go.

1049
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:16,042
Don't tell anybody what I heard, okay?

1050
01:07:16,131 --> 01:07:17,940
Sure! Thanks!

1051
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:21,911
You don't have to leave so fast.

1052
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:29,645
I'm goin' home.

1053
01:07:30,412 --> 01:07:33,393
It's Rhonda.
She's leavin' for some job in Mexico

1054
01:07:33,481 --> 01:07:35,051
and she just turned everybody against you.

1055
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:38,962
They're all in there. Says you don't
have any more money, man.

1056
01:07:40,088 --> 01:07:42,090
- She says you're a fraud.
- I got it.

1057
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:46,472
Well...

1058
01:07:49,297 --> 01:07:53,473
I want to say it has been
an amazing experience here.

1059
01:07:55,203 --> 01:07:59,948
Each of you,
I've come to know in some small way.

1060
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:03,352
But the financial climate being what it is,

1061
01:08:03,445 --> 01:08:05,322
- I think none of us thought we'd...

1062
01:08:07,048 --> 01:08:08,493
Well...

1063
01:08:09,818 --> 01:08:11,923
I don't know how to say this.

1064
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:24,609
I've been an adventure addict
my whole life.

1065
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:28,170
With no big regard for cost.

1066
01:08:31,306 --> 01:08:33,479
With... Well, with no regard for cost.

1067
01:08:34,576 --> 01:08:38,524
Basically, I was just an observer
and a writer.

1068
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:42,959
But this is my first real adventure.

1069
01:08:46,988 --> 01:08:49,025
And I just want to say that

1070
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:54,530
it's been the best one of all
because it's personal.

1071
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:01,070
And thanks to my Katherine,

1072
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:13,051
the money came through.

1073
01:09:14,516 --> 01:09:17,087
So, I don't know what you've heard,

1074
01:09:17,886 --> 01:09:22,596
but I am able to say,
though I don't have a lot,

1075
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:26,100
I do have enough to get us by.

1076
01:09:26,227 --> 01:09:28,730
And if you stick with me,
I will give this everything.

1077
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:32,778
But I will need everything from you
and we are going to reopen this zoo.

1078
01:09:32,901 --> 01:09:35,211
It is the best job in the world.

1079
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:39,447
And it's gonna take everything
to make it work.

1080
01:09:41,409 --> 01:09:45,221
So don't... Don't give up on our adventure.

1081
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,091
Well, that's good enough for me.

1082
01:09:47,182 --> 01:09:49,594
- Me, too.
- Done, man.

1083
01:09:49,684 --> 01:09:50,958
- All right.
- Whoo!

1084
01:09:56,124 --> 01:09:57,933
Yeah!

1085
01:09:58,026 --> 01:09:59,232
Circus money, man.

1086
01:09:59,327 --> 01:10:01,933
Our adventure is just beginning.

1087
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:03,475
That's not what I meant.

1088
01:10:03,598 --> 01:10:05,669
I know.

1089
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,508
And Rhonda?

1090
01:10:08,303 --> 01:10:10,476
I wish you the best in Mexico.

1091
01:10:10,605 --> 01:10:11,913
I don't speak Spanish.

1092
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,819
<i>AdiÃ³s.</i>

1093
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,848
All right.

1094
01:10:49,978 --> 01:10:51,355
Cut!

1095
01:10:52,013 --> 01:10:54,357
- All right!
- Almost there, buddy!

1096
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,179
You just get that hat?

1097
01:11:13,268 --> 01:11:15,714
So you woke up this morning
and you thought to yourself...

1098
01:11:15,837 --> 01:11:17,407
it's cold.

1099
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:19,041
..."I'm gonna put on this hat."

1100
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:20,881
Why? What do I look like in the hat?

1101
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,893
I think Spar will like these.

1102
01:11:34,222 --> 01:11:36,862
All right, do we need anything else
while we're in the land of people?

1103
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:38,494
Nope. I'm good.

1104
01:11:38,593 --> 01:11:39,663
Yeah?

1105
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:43,104
How come you don't tell stories any more?

1106
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:46,405
Well, because we're livin' the story.

1107
01:11:46,534 --> 01:11:48,070
I wish we could tell Mom that.

1108
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,916
You don't think Mom knows?

1109
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,575
I know she knows.

1110
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:55,353
Me, too.

1111
01:11:59,814 --> 01:12:02,624
Okay. $74.39.

1112
01:12:03,985 --> 01:12:05,396
I don't come up with the prices.

1113
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,763
No, it's not the prices. it's me.

1114
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:11,130
It's really well worn.

1115
01:12:11,259 --> 01:12:13,967
- It might not work.
- It'll work.

1116
01:12:14,729 --> 01:12:16,106
- It... it'll work.
- No, no, no.

1117
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:19,303
It's just that it says
"Rosemoor Animal Park".

1118
01:12:19,434 --> 01:12:21,573
- That's the one.
- You work there?

1119
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,048
I do, and I also own it.

1120
01:12:24,839 --> 01:12:26,910
Strange but true.

1121
01:12:27,008 --> 01:12:28,954
- We bought a zoo!
- Throttle down.

1122
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,752
I love that zoo!

1123
01:12:31,846 --> 01:12:33,257
Really?

1124
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:35,954
Oh, my... We used to go there all the time!

1125
01:12:36,084 --> 01:12:37,825
- Is it gonna open again soon?
- Yes.

1126
01:12:37,919 --> 01:12:39,523
We're gonna open in a few days.

1127
01:12:39,654 --> 01:12:41,429
We're goin' for the 7th, 7/7.

1128
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,969
7/7. Well, you know what?
I'm gonna be there.

1129
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:47,437
You reserve me nine tickets,
'cause I'm gonna bring the in-laws.

1130
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:50,135
And maybe we could feed
a couple of 'em to the tigers.

1131
01:12:53,101 --> 01:12:54,739
Thank you so much.

1132
01:12:56,137 --> 01:12:59,346
I'm sorry. Mister! Your bulbs.

1133
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:04,023
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1134
01:13:04,145 --> 01:13:06,182
- 7/7.
- 7/7.

1135
01:13:06,481 --> 01:13:09,792
You want to hear somethin' crazy?
I think we're gonna be okay.

1136
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:15,434
Come on, man, we talked about this.

1137
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:17,367
You gotta eat that food
to get all the meds.

1138
01:13:18,693 --> 01:13:21,697
You know, there's a major buzz
waitin' for you inside that meat.

1139
01:13:22,397 --> 01:13:24,308
Your neurotransmitters are gonna be firin'

1140
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:26,902
all the way to the moon and back.

1141
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:29,242
You'll be dating seven-year-olds.

1142
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:32,147
Have every house cat from here to El Cajon.

1143
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,891
Buddy, if you don't eat the food

1144
01:13:42,717 --> 01:13:45,027
- and you don't get your medicine,

1145
01:13:50,091 --> 01:13:52,367
it all goes downhill very fast.

1146
01:13:54,796 --> 01:13:57,072
I'm tellin' you the truth.

1147
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,181
Trust me.

1148
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:10,015
Come on, man, we're almost there.

1149
01:14:10,111 --> 01:14:12,091
You gotta stick with me.

1150
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,892
We got opening day comin' up.

1151
01:14:29,397 --> 01:14:31,138
He's fine. He's okay.

1152
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:50,580
Well, can we use the ladder?

1153
01:15:51,012 --> 01:15:52,423
We tried luring him with food.

1154
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:53,754
He's gotta come down from there.

1155
01:15:53,848 --> 01:15:55,327
He's gotta eat his food,
he's gotta drink water,

1156
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:56,451
he's gotta take his medication.

1157
01:15:56,584 --> 01:15:57,722
He's dehydrated.

1158
01:15:57,819 --> 01:15:59,992
I mean, we've gotta
get him into the enclosure.

1159
01:16:00,121 --> 01:16:01,896
Are the other two inside?

1160
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,231
- Benjamin!
- Look, if he moves to attack me,

1161
01:16:04,325 --> 01:16:05,633
at least he'll be moving, right?

1162
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,240
- He's slow, I can outrun him.
- It's not a bullfight.

1163
01:16:08,329 --> 01:16:09,899
Benjamin!

1164
01:16:10,765 --> 01:16:11,937
I think it's time.

1165
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:15,981
For what?

1166
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:18,248
He's ready. Let's call the vet.

1167
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,081
You're the owner. You have to okay this.

1168
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:29,284
No, man.

1169
01:16:32,053 --> 01:16:33,828
Look, this doesn't feel right.

1170
01:16:34,522 --> 01:16:36,502
Benjamin, it never feels right.

1171
01:16:39,894 --> 01:16:42,807
- Stuck?
- Yeah, stuck. He's stuck.

1172
01:16:42,897 --> 01:16:45,537
- Anybody, ideas?
- Loud noises scare the big cats.

1173
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,112
Loud noises scare the big cats.

1174
01:16:47,201 --> 01:16:48,179
Wait. Hold on.

1175
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:49,281
We can scare him
into goin' back in.

1176
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:50,610
That's a good idea. All right,

1177
01:16:50,705 --> 01:16:51,775
- when I give the signal...
- Hey, hold on a sec.

1178
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:53,716
...you guys just yell, scream,
make as much noise as possible.

1179
01:16:53,841 --> 01:16:55,115
Spar's gonna hate it,
but maybe he'll come down.

1180
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:56,280
I don't know. it's our only option.

1181
01:16:56,377 --> 01:16:57,549
- Hold on.
- So, guys, get pots, pans,

1182
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:58,783
stuff like that, okay?

1183
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,382
Nathan? Nathan, go to two.

1184
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:02,961
Nathan? Nathan, wake up!

1185
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:07,324
- Come on, get off!

1186
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:09,060
Get off of there, Spar!

1187
01:17:09,657 --> 01:17:11,136
We love you, Spar!

1188
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:17,005
Come on! Come down, Spar!
Come on down!

1189
01:17:17,098 --> 01:17:19,305
Come on, honey, come down for us!

1190
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:22,912
Come on, get down, Spar! Get down!

1191
01:17:23,037 --> 01:17:25,039
Come on, Spar! Come on, come on!

1192
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:27,483
Get down off the rock, Spar!

1193
01:17:27,575 --> 01:17:29,054
Come on down!

1194
01:17:31,112 --> 01:17:32,648
Come on, hotshot, come on!

1195
01:17:34,749 --> 01:17:38,424
Would you just do what's good for you?
Will you listen and get off the rock?

1196
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:41,534
Would you just listen sometimes
and do what's good for you?

1197
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:44,194
- Come on, Spar! Come on!
- You're an animal! You can't do this to me!

1198
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:45,828
Come on, baby!

1199
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:47,565
That's it! That's it, that's it!
Go, go there!

1200
01:17:47,695 --> 01:17:49,333
Get off the rocks!
Get off the rocks!

1201
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:52,240
Do you think I want to do this by myself?

1202
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:53,607
Do you think I want to come out here

1203
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:55,271
and drag you out here?

1204
01:17:55,403 --> 01:17:57,349
I did it because I was desperate!

1205
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:16,627
Benjamin?

1206
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:19,637
Hey, look, I'm feelin'
a real lack of privacy right now.

1207
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:21,638
Like, maybe we're all a bit
in each other's pockets.

1208
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:23,470
Can't you see his legs?
He's suffering, man.

1209
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:25,976
He's in a lot of pain.
I can't stand to watch it.

1210
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,307
- I know him. I see it.
- Yeah, I mean, I know him.

1211
01:18:28,436 --> 01:18:30,040
Hey! HEY...

1212
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:31,879
He's in so much pain.

1213
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:34,249
They can't tell you, but they show you.
You know, they show you.

1214
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:36,379
Well, hang on.
What is all the cheering about, then?

1215
01:18:36,477 --> 01:18:37,956
- He's okay.
- It's going to happen.

1216
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,114
He's better.

1217
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:40,624
It's going to happen.

1218
01:18:40,748 --> 01:18:42,659
- Don't repeat it to me like I'm a kid.
- It's going to happen.

1219
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:46,061
You've never done this before!
You don't know how this goes!

1220
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:47,758
I know exactly how this goes.

1221
01:18:47,855 --> 01:18:50,165
And I invite you to
tell me about that sometime.

1222
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:51,634
But this is a rookie mistake.

1223
01:18:51,759 --> 01:18:53,067
I've been with him for 13 years.

1224
01:18:53,661 --> 01:18:55,299
You can't see how selfish this is,

1225
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,637
to extend this?
Come on, you're too smart not to.

1226
01:18:58,032 --> 01:19:00,569
I'm saying, we just let him live
for a couple more weeks.

1227
01:19:00,668 --> 01:19:02,773
Get him some medicine and
invest in a little bit of hope!

1228
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:06,215
No, I can't stand by and watch this happen!

1229
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:08,821
- I'm not gonna do it!
- Well, it's not up to you.

1230
01:19:09,744 --> 01:19:11,018
It's gonna happen.

1231
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:17,088
Don't make me get angry.

1232
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:18,926
'Cause that would just
be so terrible, if you got angry.

1233
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,465
You know what the right thing to do is!

1234
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:22,159
I'm so disappointed in you.

1235
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:28,372
Well, you don't even
know me well enough to say that!

1236
01:19:31,332 --> 01:19:33,972
Hi, Lucy.
When are you gonna have those babies?

1237
01:19:36,404 --> 01:19:38,543
Hey, Rosie. Your dad around?

1238
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:41,313
He said he was goin' to think.
He does that sometimes.

1239
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:43,379
You guys makin' dinner?

1240
01:19:43,778 --> 01:19:44,984
- No.
- Well, let me help you.

1241
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:47,059
- I'll order a pizza or something.
- No, look, it's fine.

1242
01:19:47,181 --> 01:19:50,162
Look, Dad'll be back soon.
He's just having a mood.

1243
01:19:50,251 --> 01:19:52,162
Yeah? How long do those last?

1244
01:19:52,253 --> 01:19:53,891
A couple of years.

1245
01:20:00,561 --> 01:20:02,768
Pizza. Pizza, pizza, pizza.

1246
01:20:03,798 --> 01:20:05,277
Smells good.

1247
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,938
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1248
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:11,778
- You miss Lily?
- Me?

1249
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:14,845
- No.
- I bet you put all your feelings

1250
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:17,355
- into your drawings?
- Nah, not really.

1251
01:20:18,279 --> 01:20:21,260
I guess I just can't
talk to girls that well?

1252
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:25,396
Well, talkin' to girls is easy.
They'll tell you everything.

1253
01:20:25,486 --> 01:20:27,898
The secret to talking is listening.

1254
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:27,492
I thought if I came out here it would stop.

1255
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:36,061
Back home, every place
reminded me of her.

1256
01:21:36,824 --> 01:21:40,601
Filippe's on Third Street. Balboa Park.

1257
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:44,310
Little Dom's, the coffee shop,
that... That's a big one.

1258
01:21:45,266 --> 01:21:47,644
I mean, the air,
the way it smelled in May and August,

1259
01:21:47,835 --> 01:21:49,007
because those were the months that her

1260
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:51,845
favorite bushes grew flowers
all over our neighborhood.

1261
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,551
They're all triggers, man.

1262
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:56,988
And it got better for a while.

1263
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:59,649
I mean, it... It did, out here.

1264
01:22:01,682 --> 01:22:03,719
But the funny thing is that

1265
01:22:04,585 --> 01:22:06,826
it just turns out that she's here, too.

1266
01:22:07,755 --> 01:22:10,895
I mean, I go to Home Depot.
I go to the nine-miles-away Target.

1267
01:22:11,058 --> 01:22:12,162
We need a new store.

1268
01:22:14,028 --> 01:22:16,736
And seriously, I'm
avoiding half the aisles.

1269
01:22:16,864 --> 01:22:18,241
Condiments.

1270
01:22:18,866 --> 01:22:20,868
Pastries, forget about it.

1271
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:25,144
She loved red kites
and blueberry Pop-Tarts.

1272
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:26,877
I mean, who doesn't, right?

1273
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:28,043
Who doesn't?

1274
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:35,588
If only I could talk to her
about getting over her.

1275
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:39,363
Yeah.

1276
01:22:41,255 --> 01:22:44,429
And most of all, it's the kids.
They're the biggest triggers of all.

1277
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:47,663
I mean, Dylan. His eyes.

1278
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:50,333
You know, I've only seen
that expression in somebody's eyes

1279
01:22:50,431 --> 01:22:52,342
once in my life.

1280
01:22:52,433 --> 01:22:56,404
And the way he just drives me nuts,
he makes me crazy.

1281
01:22:56,537 --> 01:22:58,710
Denies me, frustrates me.

1282
01:22:58,806 --> 01:23:03,277
And all the time,
he's looking back at me with her eyes.

1283
01:23:05,713 --> 01:23:07,590
And none of her lightness.

1284
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:17,065
What I've figured out is that
when you love somebody that much,

1285
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:19,764
that hard, that long,

1286
01:23:21,662 --> 01:23:24,438
you can never get away from them,
no matter where you go.

1287
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:26,609
And that only comes

1288
01:23:28,402 --> 01:23:29,813
once in a lifetime.

1289
01:23:36,110 --> 01:23:38,283
Just can't get a handle on it.

1290
01:23:42,983 --> 01:23:44,724
I cannot let go.

1291
01:23:54,161 --> 01:23:55,640
I can.

1292
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:59,972
Sleep well, Benjamin. Sweet dreams.

1293
01:24:07,508 --> 01:24:11,115
I get it now, okay?
I get why you can't stand me!

1294
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:13,425
Okay. All right.

1295
01:24:13,514 --> 01:24:16,654
No. At least now I know the real reason
why you hate me!

1296
01:24:16,784 --> 01:24:18,286
Look, I heard you admit it to her.

1297
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,359
Like you were talking about cornflakes.

1298
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:22,661
You hate me!

1299
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:25,430
I hate you? Wait a second.

1300
01:24:25,526 --> 01:24:28,336
Okay, we've had some problems, man,
but we're figurin' it out, okay?

1301
01:24:28,462 --> 01:24:29,964
That is bullshit!

1302
01:24:30,064 --> 01:24:32,670
Admit it! You wish I wasn't here!

1303
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,871
With that expression in my eyes?

1304
01:24:35,002 --> 01:24:36,345
I heard you!

1305
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:38,916
Hold on! Enough with the drama! All right?

1306
01:24:39,373 --> 01:24:41,011
Knock it off! You misheard me!

1307
01:24:41,108 --> 01:24:43,110
I can't stand it here!
Look, can't you see that?

1308
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:45,451
No, but thank you for telling me, again!

1309
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:48,024
I keep forgetting! it's all about you!

1310
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:50,891
Why don't I just pack us up?
We'll just go on the road together.

1311
01:24:51,018 --> 01:24:52,156
We could be hobos.

1312
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:54,062
Because you wasted all our money!

1313
01:24:54,188 --> 01:24:55,861
Some of that belonged to me, Dad!

1314
01:24:56,023 --> 01:24:58,867
I didn't waste our money.
I thought you liked it here.

1315
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,172
And I'm sorry, I thought your friends
would come out and visit you, man.

1316
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:05,039
I called them all myself and I invited 'em.

1317
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:07,737
And I'm sorry,
I thought you and Lily were friends.

1318
01:25:07,868 --> 01:25:09,074
I thought, I thought, I thought...

1319
01:25:09,203 --> 01:25:10,580
I thought this was...

1320
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:11,740
I mean, I thought you liked me!

1321
01:25:11,872 --> 01:25:13,180
I thought this was
a dream come true for us!

1322
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,015
It's your dream!

1323
01:25:15,109 --> 01:25:17,316
You can't force a dream
onto someone else, Dad!

1324
01:25:17,411 --> 01:25:18,389
Yes, I can!

1325
01:25:18,512 --> 01:25:20,150
- I can force a dream on you!
- Why are you yelling?

1326
01:25:20,247 --> 01:25:21,988
Because it's a good dream!

1327
01:25:22,082 --> 01:25:24,858
And it's got cool animals in it
and some pretty great people, too!

1328
01:25:25,519 --> 01:25:27,829
And because I'm your father
and I'm the only one you've got!

1329
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:32,393
And the line of people in this world
who really care about you ends here!

1330
01:25:32,526 --> 01:25:35,530
So stop moping around this place, man!

1331
01:25:35,629 --> 01:25:37,905
And pick up a shovel and dig a hole!

1332
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:39,911
Do something!

1333
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:41,672
You just sit here
and feel sorry for yourself, man!

1334
01:25:41,769 --> 01:25:43,180
Help me with your sister!

1335
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:46,183
- Help me, damn it!
- Help me, damn it! Help me!

1336
01:25:57,751 --> 01:26:01,289
I'm sorry that your mother
got sick when she did.

1337
01:26:01,822 --> 01:26:03,233
Believe me.

1338
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:10,308
I'm sorry that you didn't get
more of a childhood, man.

1339
01:26:11,632 --> 01:26:13,839
That's just how that one went.

1340
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:19,785
But we live with a seven-year-old girl
who still believes in the Easter Bunny.

1341
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:25,920
What are we gonna do?

1342
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:28,850
You never ask me how I'm doin'.

1343
01:26:29,717 --> 01:26:32,254
You never even taught me how to shave.

1344
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:34,462
What, you want to know how to shave?

1345
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:39,497
I would love to teach you how to shave!

1346
01:26:40,194 --> 01:26:41,639
Let's shave!

1347
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:47,538
What about the Easter Bunny?

1348
01:27:23,938 --> 01:27:25,542
Is it time?

1349
01:28:05,012 --> 01:28:06,753
What happened with you and Lily?

1350
01:28:07,481 --> 01:28:08,926
I don't know.

1351
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:14,330
I guess I didn't listen to something
she told me or somethin'?

1352
01:28:14,955 --> 01:28:16,662
I mean, I liked her.

1353
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:21,137
It's like you embarrass yourself
if you say something,

1354
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:24,067
and you embarrass yourself if you don't.

1355
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:33,418
I like it when you talk.

1356
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:42,658
You know, sometimes all you need
is 20 seconds of insane courage.

1357
01:28:42,783 --> 01:28:47,425
Just, literally 20 seconds
of just embarrassing bravery.

1358
01:28:47,988 --> 01:28:52,459
And I promise you,
something great will come of it.

1359
01:29:03,337 --> 01:29:05,647
I never know what to say to you.

1360
01:29:11,912 --> 01:29:13,550
I'm the same way.

1361
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:23,199
Why don't we just tell each other
what we wish the other guy would say?

1362
01:29:25,826 --> 01:29:28,238
"I'm sorry I brought you
out to the sticks."

1363
01:29:28,362 --> 01:29:30,308
"You're a great dad."

1364
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:40,916
You did your best, Dad.

1365
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:44,022
He knows that.

1366
01:30:04,064 --> 01:30:05,441
Okay.

1367
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:08,739
Come on, Dad. Let's go home.

1368
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:52,711
I sot her!

1369
01:32:54,668 --> 01:32:56,147
Come on, let's go!

1370
01:32:56,269 --> 01:32:57,270
Here.

1371
01:33:02,943 --> 01:33:04,923
No tag backs! I know.

1372
01:33:21,628 --> 01:33:23,335
Whoo!

1373
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:26,327
You would have done the same for me.

1374
01:34:28,061 --> 01:34:29,472
Why not?

1375
01:35:00,761 --> 01:35:03,264
Hey, I need you for a second. I gotta...

1376
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:05,232
- Sure.
- ...borrow your artist's eye.

1377
01:35:05,365 --> 01:35:07,038
You gotta tell me what you think

1378
01:35:08,702 --> 01:35:10,375
about this.

1379
01:35:13,774 --> 01:35:15,219
Not bad? Huh?

1380
01:35:16,777 --> 01:35:18,154
Where are you putting this?

1381
01:35:18,612 --> 01:35:20,614
I don't know. I was thinkin' maybe

1382
01:35:20,714 --> 01:35:21,886
everywhere.

1383
01:35:25,085 --> 01:35:28,726
I'm your fan, man.
Don't you know that by now?

1384
01:35:30,957 --> 01:35:33,198
Dad? Dad, the peacocks are hatching!

1385
01:35:34,294 --> 01:35:35,967
Did you give 'em
all names, Rosie?

1386
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:37,064
Mmm-hmm.

1387
01:35:37,164 --> 01:35:39,542
- Which one's that one right there?
- Lucy.

1388
01:35:39,633 --> 01:35:41,772
Wait, not Lucy. Peaches.

1389
01:35:41,868 --> 01:35:45,748
Peaches. How do you keep 'em all straight?
You have three named Peaches.

1390
01:35:48,976 --> 01:35:50,922
Would somebody
just get my tranq gun?

1391
01:35:51,011 --> 01:35:53,116
My brother can't take no for an answer.

1392
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:55,056
Not why I'm here, bro.

1393
01:35:55,849 --> 01:35:58,420
I talked to MacCready. Hello, children.

1394
01:35:58,518 --> 01:36:00,759
I asked him if you guys needed any help.

1395
01:36:00,854 --> 01:36:03,562
In the trunk of this car is haddock.

1396
01:36:03,657 --> 01:36:05,159
Two hundred pounds' worth.

1397
01:36:08,495 --> 01:36:10,304
- For Bruno.
- Buster.

1398
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:11,636
Whatever.

1399
01:36:11,765 --> 01:36:13,472
- Are you serious?
- No.

1400
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,911
Serious is the smell in that car.

1401
01:36:17,003 --> 01:36:20,780
I started questioning my entire being
back there on the 405.

1402
01:36:20,874 --> 01:36:26,187
<i>It was like Altered States.
I saw an iguana and a dwarf Indian.</i>

1403
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:28,118
Aw, Dunc.

1404
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:31,822
All right. Come on.
Got an inspection tomorrow.

1405
01:36:33,453 --> 01:36:35,831
- So we do.
- So we do.

1406
01:36:49,703 --> 01:36:53,845
Duncan, Duncan, Duncan!
That defeats its own purpose!

1407
01:36:55,809 --> 01:36:57,413
What you got her painting there, Rosie?

1408
01:36:57,511 --> 01:36:58,512
Ladybugs.

1409
01:36:59,546 --> 01:37:00,547
Wait.

1410
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:06,788
Behold, Mac. Our new logo.

1411
01:37:07,854 --> 01:37:09,993
- You got it?
- Yeah. It fits.

1412
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:13,234
- Now it's official.
- Love our logo, she's a beaut.

1413
01:37:22,202 --> 01:37:23,840
- Did I look like that?
- Worse.

1414
01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:27,884
Wow. it's humiliating.
You seem really calm.

1415
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:31,512
- Have you been drinking?
- All night long.

1416
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:33,682
- Thanks for that.
- Any time.

1417
01:37:34,748 --> 01:37:35,954
Okay.

1418
01:37:36,049 --> 01:37:37,528
Well, this is it.

1419
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:40,131
I want everyone to stay off their walkies.

1420
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:42,666
If anybody has any problem,
I don't want to hear about it

1421
01:37:42,756 --> 01:37:45,532
until after Walter Ferris is gone. Got it?

1422
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:48,597
All right, here we go.

1423
01:37:48,695 --> 01:37:50,140
Here's to us.

1424
01:37:57,404 --> 01:38:00,817
Mr. Ferris. Welcome back to
the Rosemoor Animal Park Adventure.

1425
01:38:01,641 --> 01:38:03,552
It's an adventure now?

1426
01:38:03,677 --> 01:38:05,657
Well, to be precise, sir,

1427
01:38:05,745 --> 01:38:07,782
it always was.

1428
01:38:10,183 --> 01:38:12,527
- Hello, MacCready.
- Hello.

1429
01:38:15,722 --> 01:38:18,202
- How are you?
- On my best behavior.

1430
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:21,537
I like the jumpsuit.

1431
01:38:21,661 --> 01:38:23,902
- Love the tie.
- Thank you.

1432
01:38:28,134 --> 01:38:29,408
Wait for me, Dad.

1433
01:38:31,872 --> 01:38:33,977
Well, that's one way to do it.

1434
01:38:42,616 --> 01:38:44,027
Moist.

1435
01:39:47,581 --> 01:39:49,083
Oh, God.

1436
01:40:01,428 --> 01:40:03,430
<i>MacCready, I would love it
if you could come and meet me</i>

1437
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:05,601
<i>by Solomon's enclosure. Bye.</i>

1438
01:40:07,867 --> 01:40:09,540
Let's go see Solomon's enclosure.

1439
01:40:15,074 --> 01:40:16,747
We're sunk. We're doomed.

1440
01:40:22,715 --> 01:40:25,719
Come, MacCready, please come, please.

1441
01:40:25,819 --> 01:40:27,594
Thank God you're here.

1442
01:40:27,721 --> 01:40:29,291
I asked you so politely,
I didn't think you'd come.

1443
01:40:29,423 --> 01:40:31,232
And that's why I came.
You're never that polite. What's up?

1444
01:40:31,324 --> 01:40:33,565
The lock is broken
and I feel like the only way...

1445
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:35,697
Oh, God, the only way to fix it
is to jimmy it from the inside.

1446
01:40:38,465 --> 01:40:39,443
{made this lack.

1447
01:40:39,532 --> 01:40:41,478
- We're going to fail this inspection.
- We're not gonna fail it.

1448
01:40:41,568 --> 01:40:42,672
- You're going to calm down.
- Yes, I am.

1449
01:40:42,769 --> 01:40:43,804
What are you gonna do to help?

1450
01:40:43,937 --> 01:40:45,712
I'm gonna distract him
from the other side of this enclosure

1451
01:40:45,805 --> 01:40:47,580
and you're gonna not get eaten!

1452
01:40:50,977 --> 01:40:52,923
All right, it's gonna be fine.

1453
01:40:55,115 --> 01:40:56,287
Okay.

1454
01:40:56,416 --> 01:40:59,886
Hey, hey, Solomon!
Who's a handsome boy?

1455
01:40:59,986 --> 01:41:03,524
Come on, Solomon. Come on, baby!
Over here.

1456
01:41:03,623 --> 01:41:06,604
Ooh! Hey!

1457
01:41:06,726 --> 01:41:09,206
Solomon! Can you hear me?

1458
01:41:09,295 --> 01:41:10,899
Come on, Solomon, come on, baby!

1459
01:41:12,065 --> 01:41:14,238
- Hey, do you want somethin' to drink?
- I don't drink.

1460
01:41:14,334 --> 01:41:15,404
Well, not even water?

1461
01:41:15,502 --> 01:41:17,311
Do you have any idea
what they put in water?

1462
01:41:18,105 --> 01:41:20,585
Over here.

1463
01:41:20,674 --> 01:41:24,247
Hey, good boy, good Solomon!
Good Solomon! Good boy! Good boy!

1464
01:41:24,744 --> 01:41:27,224
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

1465
01:41:27,514 --> 01:41:30,791
Who's a handsome boy? Keep working!
Hurry up! Would you hurry up?

1466
01:41:30,917 --> 01:41:32,897
I can only keep his attention for so long!

1467
01:41:32,986 --> 01:41:35,227
Hi, boy! Hi, boy!
Fix it, fix it, would you?

1468
01:41:35,321 --> 01:41:37,267
I like to work in silence!

1469
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:42,300
Sheep farts in aspic!

1470
01:41:42,429 --> 01:41:43,430
Cocktails!

1471
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:46,511
I... No, no, no, no! Wait! Solomon!

1472
01:41:46,833 --> 01:41:48,403
Solomon! Come here! Come here!
Come here!

1473
01:41:48,502 --> 01:41:51,312
Come here! Oh, God! Don't turn around.

1474
01:41:51,438 --> 01:41:53,918
Don't turn around!
Turn around. Turn around!

1475
01:41:56,276 --> 01:41:57,880
You don't want me!

1476
01:41:57,977 --> 01:42:01,584
I am filled with Scotch and bitterness
and impure thoughts!

1477
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:05,957
I can hear Ferris right now! MacCready!

1478
01:42:06,085 --> 01:42:07,462
Got it!

1479
01:42:11,925 --> 01:42:13,768
Okay.

1480
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:20,472
Afternoon, Solomon!

1481
01:42:51,330 --> 01:42:52,308
Hey, mister.

1482
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:54,037
Everybody says you're a dick.

1483
01:42:55,301 --> 01:42:58,874
I don't know what that means,
but I don't believe it.

1484
01:43:10,983 --> 01:43:12,621
I don't think it's gonna work.

1485
01:43:22,195 --> 01:43:23,196
But good luck.

1486
01:43:27,367 --> 01:43:28,641
- Yes!
- Yes!

1487
01:43:35,508 --> 01:43:37,010
Hey, listen.

1488
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:38,919
I want to see you here opening day.

1489
01:43:39,779 --> 01:43:42,020
I don't fraternize, Mr. Mee.

1490
01:43:42,115 --> 01:43:43,890
I'm sure I'll have plenty of reports.

1491
01:43:48,554 --> 01:43:49,828
We did it!

1492
01:43:50,223 --> 01:43:52,169
- We win!
- Yeah!

1493
01:43:54,027 --> 01:43:56,405
- Kelly!
- Way to go, Benji!

1494
01:43:59,499 --> 01:44:00,603
I told you...

1495
01:44:01,834 --> 01:44:02,812
Whoo!

1496
01:44:05,138 --> 01:44:08,483
So, Ernesto and his friends
are plastering posters everywhere

1497
01:44:08,575 --> 01:44:10,054
within a 20-mile radius.

1498
01:44:11,077 --> 01:44:13,956
- What happens if nobody comes?
- What?

1499
01:44:14,714 --> 01:44:17,718
What happens if literally
we did this whole thing for nothing?

1500
01:44:18,451 --> 01:44:21,796
Come on, give me a break.
You've come this far. Huh?

1501
01:44:25,225 --> 01:44:26,295
We walk

1502
01:44:27,327 --> 01:44:28,772
with lions.

1503
01:44:32,999 --> 01:44:34,103
Good aim.

1504
01:44:34,834 --> 01:44:36,279
I'm gonna say this one more time, buddy.

1505
01:44:37,236 --> 01:44:39,978
I like the animals, but I love the humans.

1506
01:44:42,309 --> 01:44:43,754
You do somethin' for the right reasons,

1507
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:46,814
nothing can stop you.

1508
01:45:30,723 --> 01:45:32,396
Okay. Okay.

1509
01:45:42,301 --> 01:45:44,110
- Hi.
- Hi.

1510
01:45:44,204 --> 01:45:48,949
Look, am I nuts to say that
I missed you like crazy a lot? A lot.

1511
01:45:52,545 --> 01:45:54,547
Plus, I wasn't named after Bob Dylan.

1512
01:45:55,815 --> 01:45:57,692
I was named after a dog named Dylan.

1513
01:46:02,855 --> 01:46:05,734
I don't even care. Who cares?

1514
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:09,471
- Sorry about the rain.
- No, I love it.

1515
01:46:09,562 --> 01:46:12,509
I love your hair.
I loved your sign, Lily. I love you.

1516
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:37,459
<i>The precipitation tonight</i>

1517
01:46:37,557 --> 01:46:39,468
<i>is just a hint of
what's yet to come!</i>

1518
01:46:39,559 --> 01:46:42,039
<i>- I would definitely put this...</i>

1519
01:46:42,128 --> 01:46:43,106
<i>Get an umbrella.</i>

1520
01:46:43,429 --> 01:46:46,000
<i>Or better yet, just stay indoors</i>

1521
01:46:46,099 --> 01:46:49,273
<i>Look, my cameraman
just handed me his umbrella</i>

1522
01:46:50,036 --> 01:46:55,042
<i>Betsy, we're told that this is gonna be
the wettest summer in over 100 years!</i>

1523
01:46:55,308 --> 01:46:58,050
<i>Back to you guys in your
cozy little studio.</i>

1524
01:47:38,251 --> 01:47:40,128
Nathan, we're running out of yams
and monkey chow.

1525
01:47:40,253 --> 01:47:42,199
Can you check on the invoice order?

1526
01:47:42,588 --> 01:47:44,795
Yeah. Take it all.

1527
01:47:45,992 --> 01:47:47,767
Just like Sheila did.

1528
01:48:17,256 --> 01:48:18,894
<i>On this July Eth, 2010,</i>

1529
01:48:22,361 --> 01:48:25,865
<i>Very heavy rain and plenty of lightning
continue throughout the week.</i>

1530
01:48:58,097 --> 01:48:59,440
Dylan?

1531
01:48:59,565 --> 01:49:01,442
- Dylan! Dad!
- Dyl?

1532
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:04,845
- I see it.
- Okay. Get ready.

1533
01:49:10,777 --> 01:49:12,256
Whoa!

1534
01:49:12,378 --> 01:49:14,380
Wait a minute, turn around. Let me see.

1535
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:16,790
What? The hair, what happened to the hair?

1536
01:49:16,916 --> 01:49:19,157
French braids. Big in the '90s.

1537
01:49:19,285 --> 01:49:20,764
Nice, very nice.

1538
01:49:20,853 --> 01:49:23,129
They're gonna be here today, Benjamin.
I know it.

1539
01:49:23,256 --> 01:49:25,258
10:00, this place'll be packed.

1540
01:49:27,093 --> 01:49:30,802
Okay, well, we all know that I stink
at speeches, so I won't even try.

1541
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:32,273
If Katherine were here,
she would have come up with

1542
01:49:32,364 --> 01:49:34,640
somethin' really funny
and clever for me to say,

1543
01:49:34,767 --> 01:49:37,008
and I'd have taken full credit.

1544
01:49:37,703 --> 01:49:41,173
It's not about where an adventure ends,

1545
01:49:41,307 --> 01:49:43,913
'cause that's not
what an adventure's about.

1546
01:49:44,610 --> 01:49:47,352
So anything that happens
from here on out is a bonus.

1547
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:51,995
And I love you guys.

1548
01:49:52,852 --> 01:49:54,923
Okay! Let's open the gates!

1549
01:49:58,291 --> 01:50:00,202
- It's a zoo!

1550
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:01,461
Yes, it is!

1551
01:50:13,973 --> 01:50:16,283
- What time is it?
- 10:02.

1552
01:50:17,343 --> 01:50:18,788
They should be here.

1553
01:50:18,878 --> 01:50:20,221
Patience, my son. Patience.

1554
01:50:21,147 --> 01:50:23,218
No, he's right. They should be here.

1555
01:50:23,349 --> 01:50:24,828
Look, maybe it's supposed
to be this way. I don't know.

1556
01:50:24,917 --> 01:50:27,124
- Maybe it's supposed to take a while.
- Dad, something's wrong.

1557
01:50:28,487 --> 01:50:30,160
- Dylan?
- No, something's wrong!

1558
01:50:30,256 --> 01:50:31,667
Dyl!

1559
01:50:37,930 --> 01:50:40,376
The tree fell down in the rain last night!

1560
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:44,038
They couldn't have gotten through
even if they were here.

1561
01:50:57,917 --> 01:50:59,328
Look!

1562
01:51:04,390 --> 01:51:06,028
Welcome! Come on, come on, we're open!

1563
01:51:08,428 --> 01:51:11,170
Hi, there. Good morning.
Welcome, welcome.

1564
01:51:11,264 --> 01:51:13,540
Come on, hi. Watch your step.

1565
01:51:13,632 --> 01:51:14,610
I'm so glad you're open.

1566
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:16,680
Thank you for coming.

1567
01:51:16,769 --> 01:51:18,146
Come on.

1568
01:51:19,372 --> 01:51:20,373
Easy.

1569
01:51:20,473 --> 01:51:23,579
- Good morning.
- Let me help you there. I gotcha!

1570
01:51:24,276 --> 01:51:25,914
There you go. I 9011 Ya

1571
01:51:26,011 --> 01:51:27,285
Of course, we have lions, man.

1572
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:29,553
Hey, man, how are ya?

1573
01:51:33,753 --> 01:51:35,494
Kelly, how's it looking
for the giraffes?

1574
01:51:35,588 --> 01:51:37,431
- How's your family?
- Great to see you.

1575
01:51:57,810 --> 01:51:59,812
Welcome to Rosemoor Animal Park.

1576
01:52:00,012 --> 01:52:01,355
Would you like a brochure?

1577
01:52:05,317 --> 01:52:08,730
Hey, guys, thanks for coming out
and welcome to your zoo.

1578
01:52:08,821 --> 01:52:10,528
As you can see,
the tigers know that you're here,

1579
01:52:10,656 --> 01:52:12,033
so they're showing off today.

1580
01:52:12,157 --> 01:52:14,000
A couple of interesting facts
about the tigers.

1581
01:52:14,127 --> 01:52:16,334
Peafowl are very resilient animals.

1582
01:52:16,462 --> 01:52:19,500
This is Lucy and Wesley, and Peaches.

1583
01:52:19,632 --> 01:52:22,169
And this is Solomon.

1584
01:52:22,301 --> 01:52:23,678
Hi, Solomon!

1585
01:52:23,803 --> 01:52:25,441
- Hey, brother, you need a map?
- Sure. Thanks.

1586
01:52:26,705 --> 01:52:29,447
It's all right. It doesn't hurt that bad.

1587
01:52:29,742 --> 01:52:31,346
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1588
01:52:31,477 --> 01:52:33,855
Thanks for saving the animals.

1589
01:52:33,979 --> 01:52:36,550
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Good job.

1590
01:52:40,019 --> 01:52:41,396
Home Depot.

1591
01:52:43,355 --> 01:52:44,834
Well done.

1592
01:52:53,165 --> 01:52:54,701
- We're out of tickets.
- Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

1593
01:52:54,833 --> 01:52:57,336
I ordered early for August.

1594
01:52:58,037 --> 01:53:00,677
I have 'em. Yeah, got 'em. Got 'em.

1595
01:53:00,773 --> 01:53:02,184
Great.

1596
01:53:03,409 --> 01:53:07,380
I got a big crush on you,
and I just can't get a handle on it, so.

1597
01:53:16,255 --> 01:53:17,666
Congratulations.

1598
01:53:19,258 --> 01:53:21,169
Congratulations to you.

1599
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:36,881
And if we're standing
near each other on New Year's,

1600
01:53:36,976 --> 01:53:38,922
we'll do this again sometime.

1601
01:53:41,113 --> 01:53:43,286
I look forward to New Year's.

1602
01:53:51,457 --> 01:53:53,232
Look over here, guys.

1603
01:53:54,226 --> 01:53:57,935
Just be yourself. This one's for Spar.

1604
01:53:58,063 --> 01:53:59,133
Say, "Peaches."

1605
01:53:59,265 --> 01:54:00,869
Peaches.

1606
01:54:00,967 --> 01:54:03,311
All right.
Give me that camera. Say, "Spar."

1607
01:54:03,436 --> 01:54:04,608
Spar.

1608
01:54:04,737 --> 01:54:06,410
And one more of me
just throwing her over.

1609
01:54:06,506 --> 01:54:08,281
- Dump me there inside the fence.
- Ready, one, two, three.

1610
01:54:08,374 --> 01:54:10,217
Ready? One, two, three!

1611
01:54:13,012 --> 01:54:16,459
If you had to choose between
people and animals, really quick,

1612
01:54:16,582 --> 01:54:17,959
how would you choose?

1613
01:54:18,083 --> 01:54:19,460
I want to get a shot of that.

1614
01:54:19,585 --> 01:54:20,791
I'll get a close-up on your nose.

1615
01:54:29,162 --> 01:54:30,573
Me, too.

1616
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:33,041
People!

1617
01:54:37,302 --> 01:54:40,010
- You goofball.

1618
01:55:53,879 --> 01:55:56,086
- We bought a zoo.
- We did that.

1619
01:56:01,654 --> 01:56:03,964
You only have to be courageous
for 20 seconds.

1620
01:56:04,556 --> 01:56:07,469
<i>It has guided
me my entire life.</i>

1621
01:56:07,593 --> 01:56:09,539
- All right. Ladies first.
- Where are we going?

1622
01:56:12,832 --> 01:56:16,211
Now, hang on. So, okay. Stop.

1623
01:56:16,302 --> 01:56:17,713
She was

1624
01:56:18,570 --> 01:56:19,548
right there.

1625
01:56:19,638 --> 01:56:24,212
This is the moment where both of you
became a possibility.

1626
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:26,381
I love that you're telling stories again.

1627
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:29,187
This is the story before the story.

1628
01:56:29,281 --> 01:56:33,195
This is where you and you begin.

1629
01:56:33,285 --> 01:56:36,357
Because this is where I met your mom.

1630
01:56:36,822 --> 01:56:39,860
She was sitting right there in that chair.

1631
01:56:50,836 --> 01:56:52,315
Hey, hey. So.

1632
01:56:52,438 --> 01:56:53,815
I was walkin' by.

1633
01:56:56,409 --> 01:57:00,482
And I saw her and I literally stopped,
like this, just stopped.

1634
01:57:00,613 --> 01:57:03,321
And went, "Oh, my God."

1635
01:57:03,449 --> 01:57:07,454
"That is the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen in my entire life."

1636
01:57:07,586 --> 01:57:08,963
But I've never done anything like this.

1637
01:57:09,088 --> 01:57:11,898
I'd never gone and talked
to a total stranger before.

1638
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:14,231
But she was right there.

1639
01:57:14,326 --> 01:57:18,604
And so I thought to myself,
"20 seconds." Right?

1640
01:57:19,865 --> 01:57:21,276
Go.

1641
01:57:26,038 --> 01:57:29,645
Now I'm in the restaurant.
And I'm terrified.

1642
01:57:30,209 --> 01:57:31,620
Thinkin' about leaving.

1643
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:34,316
I can actually touch her.
She's right there.

1644
01:57:34,447 --> 01:57:36,120
She still hasn't seen me.

1645
01:57:36,215 --> 01:57:37,853
And I still have 15
seconds of courage left.

1646
01:57:38,517 --> 01:57:39,928
I'm goin' for it.

1647
01:57:41,287 --> 01:57:42,664
Bravery.

1648
01:57:43,088 --> 01:57:45,090
Here's what I said.

1649
01:57:52,531 --> 01:57:53,942
What?

1650
01:57:57,436 --> 01:57:59,109
I said.

1651
01:58:00,272 --> 01:58:02,274
"Excuse me."

1652
01:58:23,562 --> 01:58:24,973
Hi, Mom.

1653
01:58:25,063 --> 01:58:26,542
Hi, Mommy.

1654
01:58:34,573 --> 01:58:38,043
"Why would an amazing woman like you"

1655
01:58:38,176 --> 01:58:41,521
"even talk to someone like me?"

1656
01:58:50,022 --> 01:58:51,433
Why not?

1657
01:59:41,674 --> 01:59:44,416
<i>You made me long for</i>

1658
01:59:45,477 --> 01:59:47,821
<i>To be a part of</i>

1659
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:52,491
<i>Something that I can't see</i>

1660
01:59:52,918 --> 01:59:55,455
<i>A life that is beyond</i>

1661
01:59:57,022 --> 02:00:00,231
<i>Something that I can't fear</i>

1662
02:00:00,893 --> 02:00:03,237
<i>To be a part of</i>

1663
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:08,077
<i>The story, it belongs to you</i>

1664
02:00:23,882 --> 02:00:26,886
<i>Something you said burns</i>

1665
02:00:27,052 --> 02:00:29,999
<i>Apart the pen and the paper</i>

1666
02:00:31,623 --> 02:00:33,967
<i>You can't always write it</i>

1667
02:00:34,826 --> 02:00:38,569
<i>It is something you have to do</i>

1668
02:00:39,264 --> 02:00:41,540
<i>Gathering stories</i>

1669
02:00:43,035 --> 02:00:46,346
<i>A story, it belongs to you</i>

1670
02:00:46,772 --> 02:00:49,275
<i>They say that it's gone now</i>

1671
02:00:50,509 --> 02:00:53,786
<i>You know that I disagree</i>

1672
02:01:09,695 --> 02:01:13,040
<i>I barely hear you</i>

1673
02:01:13,698 --> 02:01:16,201
<i>Your signal is cold now</i>

1674
02:01:17,436 --> 02:01:19,541
<i>So turn me into</i>

1675
02:01:19,638 --> 02:01:24,553
<i>Video</i>

1676
02:01:26,878 --> 02:01:31,384
<i>Tune the radio</i>

1677
02:01:34,786 --> 02:01:40,031
<i>Sing along</i>

<i>Out in little pieces</i>

1681
02:01:59,678 --> 02:02:02,591
<i>And watch in a moment</i>

1682
02:02:03,482 --> 02:02:05,962
<i>Secure it for falling</i>

1683
02:02:10,455 --> 02:02:12,560
