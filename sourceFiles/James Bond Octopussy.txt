- You didn't say there'd be such security.
- They moved the ﬂight forward.

00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,104
We'll have to go ahead
as planned anyway.

12
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,399
Toro? Sounds like a load of bull.

13
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,534

Argh!

Well, it's a small world! You're a Toro, too!

00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,194

00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,825
Argh!

78
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,959
Your guests have arrived, Ambassador.

79
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,745
We should go, my dear.

80
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,897
Well...

81
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,654
I must say,
you become more beautiful every day.

82
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,660
- I'm over here!
- Of course you are!

83
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,115
This is Miss Penelope Smallbone,
my new assistant.

84
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,078
Miss Smallbone.

85
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:51,006
What can I say, Moneypenny? Except that
she is as attractive and as charming...

86
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,458
- As I used to be?
- I didn't say that.

87
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,714
You're such a ﬂatterer, James.

88
00:13:55,793 --> 00:14:00,515
Moneypenny, you know there never has
been and never will be anybody but you.

89
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,059
So you've told me.

90
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,689
- Welcome to Universal Exports.
- Take it, dear.

91
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,485
- That's all you'll ever get from him.
- Thank you, Commander Bond.

92
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,359
- Do you know me?
- Miss Moneypenny described you.

93
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,111
In nauseating detail.

94
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,201
Really?

95
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,163
I can see you're going
to fit in here very nicely.

96
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,746
- Ah, good morning, 007.
- Morning, sir.

97
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,706
- Minister.
- Commander.

98
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,043
I think you know Jim Fanning,
our art expert.

99
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,093
- Yes. Hello, Jim.
- James.

100
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,056
- Do you know what this is?
- It looks like a Fabergé egg, sir.

101
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:46,477
One of the jewelled eggs by Carl Fabergé
as a gift for the Russian royal family.

102
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,477
They're priceless and, uh... And very rare.

103
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,235
This one contains a model
of the imperial state coach.

104
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,153
- Top marks, 007
- Thank you, sir.

105
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,322
Except it's a fake.

106
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,660
There's the real thing. It's being
auctioned at Sotheby's this afternoon.

107
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,656
This is the fourth egg
to turn up at auction this year.

108
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,828
It's from none of the usual sources.

109
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,668
Anonymous seller,
numbered Swiss bank account.

110
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:14,506
I'd say that the vendor was a Russian.

111
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:19,260
And now this turns up.
A near-perfect forgery.

112
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,430
I think Commander Bond
should accompany you to the sale.

113
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,850
Splendid!
I could use an extra pair of eyes!

114
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,019
We could try and spot the seller.

115
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:32,691
They usually turn up out of interest
or perhaps just to bump up the price.

116
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,025
Thank you, Fanning.

117
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,191
Not at all.

118
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,784
If it is the Russians,
it may be an effort to raise currency

119
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,863
for covert operations abroad
or for payoffs.

120
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,620
Either way,
we'd better find out what they're up to.

121
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,623
- Yes, Minister.
- Eyes only, 007.

122
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,921
Operation Trove.

123
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,215
You'll be replacing O09.

124
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:02,174
He turned up dead in East Germany
with that egg in his hand.

125
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,426
There's not much to go on.

126
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,137
Well, we do have one lead, Minister.

127
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,886
"Property of a Lady."

128
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,480
The next subject on the agenda

129
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,684
is the continuing mutual
disarmament talks with NATO.

130
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:19,358
I assume you've all read
General Gogol's report.

131
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,316
It seems very thorough.

132
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,993
Thank you, Comrade Chairman.

133
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,993
I believe I express the opinion
of everyone present

134
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:36,500
that adoption of NATO proposals does
not compromise our defensive position.

135
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,503
(clears throat) Uh, Comrade Chairman!

136
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,005
General Orlov.

137
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,179
Er, General Gogol is presumptuous.

138
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,178
He speaks for himself and others

139
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:52,012
who cling to timid, outdated

140
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,268
and unrealistic policies!

141
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,768
Must I remind you, the committee,

142
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:03,948
of our oven/vheirning superiority
over NATO forces

143
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,113
before we give it away?

144
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,956
In East Germany
under my direct command,

145
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:24,803
I have 31 divisions,
including 11 tank divisions

146
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,721
and another five in Czechoslovakia.

147
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:32,803
In support, on the Russian western
border are 60 divisions,

148
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,557
including <i>22</i> tank divisions.

149
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,813
In all, a 10-1 advantage.

150
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:48,406
American and West German forces
can field at most ten armoured divisions.

151
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:52,660
The British maintain only a token force.

152
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:59,003
We have played out a variety of attack
strategies on the new Kutuzov computer

153
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,594
and find that a lightning thrust by
ten armoured divisions from the north,

154
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,763
and by five more
through Czechoslovakia,

155
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:13,014
lead to total victory in five days

156
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:17,355
against any possible defence scenario!

157
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,603
This is absolute madness!

158
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,731
We know where it will end.

159
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,485
NATO will counterattack
with nuclear weapons.

160
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,111
Never!

161
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,785
The West is decadent and divided.

162
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,536
It has no stomach
to risk our atomic reprisals.

163
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:41,880
Throughout Europe, daily demonstrations
demand unilateral nuclear disarmament.

164
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,374
I see no reason to risk war

165
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:49,379
to satisfy your personal paranoia
and thirst for conquest.

166
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,967
We must turn our energies
to pressing domestic problems.

167
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,805
- General Gogol, let me remind you...
- Comrades, sit down!

168
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,481
- I wish to tell you...
- Both of you!

169
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,062
World socialism
will be achieved peaceably.

170
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,319
- Our military role is strictly defensive.
- Da.

171
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,322
Is that understood, General Orlov?

172
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,158
General Gogol, would you continue?

173
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:25,670
Thank you, Comrade Chairman. I will
now turn to the specifics of my report...

174
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:29,594
Tell him I will be there
as quickly as possible.

175
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,855
Please! Please!

176
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,441
- I am trying to concentrate!
- (Orlov) Lenkin!

177
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,534
- What is it?
- It's terrible news, Comrade General!

178
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,117
The reproduction
has been stolen in transit.

179
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,963
The thief was dealt with,
but the egg was lost in the river.

180
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,709
Your incompetence will destroy us all!

181
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,638
- We'll have a replacement made.
- There is no time, Comrade General!

182
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:17,718
I have just been informed of
an unscheduled inventory in two days!

183
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,643
Control yourself, Lenkin!

184
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,311
I'll tell our London people
we must have the genuine egg back.

185
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,987
I hope we can reach them in time.

186
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,156
(bangs gavel) Sold to Busoni!

187
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,989
The next lot is number 48.

188
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,996
A superb green-gold
Imperial Easter egg by Carl Fabergé.

189
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:47,505
Enamelled in translucent green,
enclosed by gold laurel-leaf trellis.

190
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,842
Set with blue sapphires and
four petalled gold flowers with diamonds.

191
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:57,515
- How much should it fetch?
- £250-300,000. Anything more'd be crazy.

192
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,015
...used by Tsar Nicholas
in 1897 in Moscow.

193
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,809
Property of a Lady.

194
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:07,267
Well, there are quite a few ladies here.

195
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:11,354
She wouldn't have to be here in person.
She could be represented by proxy.

196
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,862
I'll start it at £150,000.

197
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,653
150, 60.

198
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,618
170. 170.

199
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,827
180, 190.

200
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,496
200. Against you, madam.

201
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,379
- Any more?
- Now there is a lady.

202
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,628
£220,000!

203
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,462
240.

204
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,139
James, stick to the business in hand.

205
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,975
£260,000.

206
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,803
280!

207
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,888
£300,000!

208
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,066
And 20?

209
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,692
Are you bidding, sir?

210
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,155
£320,000. New bidder!

211
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,324
- That's interesting.
- You know him?

212
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:09,332
- Mm. Kamal Khan. Usually a seller.
- £340,000. 360.

213
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,585
Marginal quality from dubious sources.

214
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,509
£380,000.

215
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:19,430
- 400 in the centre.
- Well, that should do it.

216
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:23,009
- Kamal has gone over the top.
- Your bid, sir. 400,000.

217
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,853
400,000! Any more?

218
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,064
- 425! New bidder.
- (gasping)

219
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,525
Thank you, sir.

220
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,192
- 425!
- Have you gone mad?

221
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,275
Let's see how badly he wants it.

222
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,698
450?

223
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,535
450. 475?

224
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,877
The bid is 450. 475?

225
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,471
Against you, sir. No more than 450.

226
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:05,973
- Er, Jim?
- The bid is £450,000.

227
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,553
(gasps)

228
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,479
I have 475.

229
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,393
- £500,000.
- (gasping)

230
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,149
£500,000.

231
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:20,487
I have half a million pounds. All done?

232
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,161
Any more?

233
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,745
Yours, sir, for £500,000!

234
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:33,045
- The next lot is...
- We could have been stuck with it.

235
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,545
- I doubt it. He had to buy it.
- But why?

236
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,922
That's what I intend to find out.

237
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,789
You had no business bidding for that egg!

238
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,043
What would you have done if you'd got it?

239
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,470
I would have claimed it was a fake, sir,
and not paid.

240
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,969
Not paid?

241
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:30,645
Here's the original. I switched it
with the fake during the auction.

242
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,813
Good God!

243
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,309
And what happens
when the buyer discovers that?

244
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:41,398
Well, he... He complains.
If he's legitimate.

245
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,817
- Well?
- I don't think he will complain.

246
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,904
According to Fanning,
this Kamal usually sells. Now he buys.

247
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,581
I believe that the fake will smoke him out.

248
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:53,998
Our tail followed him to Heathrow
where he got a plane to Delhi.

249
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,579
Hm. You must go there, too.

250
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:01,842
I'll alert Sadruddin, our man in Station I,
to keep him under surveillance.

251
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:06,423
- Book yourself on the next ﬂight out.
- Well, I've 55 minutes to catch it, sir.

252
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,926
- Oh, Bond?
- Sir?

253
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:15,186
Sign a chit for that egg before you go.
It's government property now.

254
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,937
Of course, sir.

255
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,910
(traditional tune)

256
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,502
(plays the Bond theme)

257
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,463
That's a charming tune.
You do take English money?

258
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,765
Only gold sovereigns.

259
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,135
Please.

260
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,105
I'm Vijay.
Special expediter, Universal Exports.

261
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,059
- Welcome to India, Commander Bond.
- Call me James.

262
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,985
- Where's Sadruddin?
- Over here, waiting in the taxi.

263
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,777
This was the wrong cover. I hate snakes!

264
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,158
Taxi! Please be comfortable.

265
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,373
- I am Sadruddin, Head of Section.
- How do you do?

266
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,539
- I booked you in at the Shivnivas Hotel.
- Good. My luggage?

267
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,708
<i>Gone ahead.</i>

268
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,545
What can you tell me about Kamal Khan?

269
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,724
Exiled Afghan prince.
Sportsman - polo, cricket, tennis.

270
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,718
- I play a bit myself.
- Really?

271
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:20,307
As a matter of fact, I've got
a part-time job as a pro at Kamal's club.

272
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,893
- What have you learned so far?
- My backhand's improved.

273
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,359
(Sadruddin) Kamal lives there on the hill.

274
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,699
The Monsoon Palace. It's heavily guarded.

275
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,239
How do I get to him?

276
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,917
He plays backgammon most evenings
at the hotel casino.

277
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,746
As a guest,
you're automatically a member.

278
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:48,422
- Then let's meet there later.
- I'll change into something less casual.

279
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,221
Oh, here. You may need this
to play with your asp.

280
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,690
Good morning. Name's Bond.
I believe you have a reservation.

281
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,945
- We've been expecting you.
- Good.

282
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,119
I hope you have a pleasant stay.

283
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,955
I'm sure I will.

284
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,790
Thank you.

285
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,919
Your luggage has been unpacked, sir.

286
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,550
Oh, thank you!

287
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,970
If I can be of further assistance...

288
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,970
- Anything at all?
- Oh, maybe later.

289
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,061
(door closes)

290
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,935
(chatter)

291
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,317
- How's he doing?
- The Major's no novice.

292
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:38,449
- But Kamal has won 200,000 rupees.
- You'll have a job beating that.

293
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,831
I feel lucky. Shall we double?

294
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,126
Of course!

295
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,954
20,000 rupees!

296
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,545
- Always a double six when you need it!
- Always.

297
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,889
- How do you do it!
- It's all in the wrist.

298
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,893
- Oh, it's hopeless.
- Shall we have another game, Major?

299
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,559
- Same stake?
- Yes, I'll have another go.

300
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,023
Your luck's got to run out some time.

301
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,654
May Uoin you?

302
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,703
Sotheby's. Half a million pounds?

303
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:25,158
- The man at the auction.
- Precisely.

304
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,538
You have a good memory for faces.

305
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,003
And figures.

306
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,675
- This can't be a coincidence.
- No.

307
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,254
- What will you have?
- Nothing, thank you.

308
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,426
Some other time, perhaps?

309
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,017
Thank you.

310
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,770
Six and one!

311
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,519
- Well?
- Looks like the Major has got him.

312
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:03,246
Why don't we make it interesting, Major?
Double to 100,000 rupees.

313
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,792
I can't accept. Not with your luck.

314
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,371
You win!

315
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:15,549
(Bond) I would have
taken that double, myself.

316
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:21,384
Then why don't you take over
the Major's position? Mr...?

317
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,306
Bond.

318
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,639
James Bond. Thank you, I'd be delighted.

319
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,517
100,000 rupees, then.

320
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,984
(Kamal) Double six.

321
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,151
(Kamal) Not such a good double
to accept, after all, was it?

322
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,913
- Double.
- Of course!

323
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,086
You can only win with a double six.

324
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:59,002
The stake is 200,000 rupees.
Do you have the cash?

325
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:06,967
Well, I think that this
should be ample security.

326
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,849
- (gasps from spectators)
- Don't you?

327
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,363
Play, Mr Bond.

328
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,359
You need a great deal of luck
to get out of this.

329
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,868
Oh, luck?

330
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:29,866
Well, then I shall use player's privilege,

331
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,539
and use your lucky dice.

332
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,163
It's all in the wrist.

333
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,548
(dice fall)

334
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,009
Double sixes.

335
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,344
Fancy that!

336
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,514
200,000 rupees.

337
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,687
I prefer cash.

338
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,069
- Get it cashed for him.
- Yes, sir.

339
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:10,581
Spend the money quickly, Mr Bond.

340
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,579
I intend to, Kamal Khan.

341
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,538
My security.

342
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,966
And yours?

343
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,430
(cracking)

344
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,937
It's not really in the wrist, you know.

345
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:53,457
- Should I be following them?
- Yes, but I think they'll be following this.

346
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,201
Thank you.

347
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:59,959
Vijay will take you from here.
I'll see if I can find out more about Kamal.

348
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,132
Good. Hold on to these, will you?

349
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,546
Keep you in curry
for a few weeks, won't it?

350
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,718
Thank you.

351
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,515
It's a wonderful racket, this.

352
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,660
(honking)

353
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:46,293
- Vijay, we have company!
- No problem. This is a company car.

354
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,757
(screaming)

355
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,682
(talking in Hindi)

356
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,684
(Bond) Step on it!

357
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,695
This should shake 'em off!

358
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,650
Oh. Thank God for hard currency!

359
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,697
Game, set and match! Hang on, James!

360
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,432
(horn)

361
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,395
Keep your head down!

362
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,441
Thank you.

363
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,462
Ow! Ooh, ooh, ooh!

364
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,271
(IN HINDI)

365
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,282
Here! Catch!

366
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,829
Excuse me.

367
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:39,011
Thank you.
You'd better stick this back yourself.

368
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,348
James, over here! Come on!

369
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,157
Vijay! The money I gave you!

370
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,204
Here! Rupees!

371
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,876
Easy come, easy go!

372
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,527
(gives orders in Hindi)

373
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,736
Hm. It certainly pays to advertise.

374
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,908
This way, James.

375
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,877
Ah, Q!

376
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,930
- How are you?
- Most unhappy, 007, thanks to you.

377
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,971
How can I be expected
to maintain the quality of my work?

378
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,016
Sent out here at a moment's notice!

379
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:11,350
Have you any smaller thread?
Someone stuck a knife in my wallet.

380
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,935
Ah, they missed you? What a pity!

381
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,654
Karen, see to that, will you?

382
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,071
I've also mislaid my PPK.

383
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,072
- Anything else?
- No, that's all.

384
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,412
Blast!

385
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,419
Having problems keeping it up, Q?

386
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,626
Experimental model.

387
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,765
- Hello, Smithers.
- Commander.

388
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:53,229
<i>-</i> Smashing, Q.
- Come on. I have a few things for you.

389
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,685
(Bond) Very nice, Smithers.

390
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,022
Is the homing device ready yet?

391
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:04,612
Not only a homing device, but an
extremely delicate microphone <i>as</i> well.

392
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,372
It goes in there like that.

393
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,958
Now, take a fountain pen.

394
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,711
Twist the top,

395
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,716
and a highly concentrated mixture
of nitric and hydrochloric acid.

396
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:22,379
- Dissolves all metals.
- Wonderful for poison-pen letters!

397
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,556
Pay attention, 007!

398
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,183
Pull the top off the pen.

399
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:31,308
With this ultrasensitive earpiece,
you can listen in on the bug.

400
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,435
The homing device is compatible with

401
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:37,314
the standard-issue
radio directional finder in your watch.

402
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,275
If you haven't lost it.

403
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,401
(beeping)

404
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,405
That's amazing, Q. It does work.

405
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,949
What's that?

406
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:54,377
Oh, that's the latest liquid crystal TV.

407
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,466
Hm, very handy!

408
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,065
Mm. Perfect image, Q.

409
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,692
Really, 007!

410
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:22,606
Look, I haven't time
for these adolescent antics.

411
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,409
- It's the best we can do.
- It's beautiful. Thank you.

412
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,988
Go on, get along! I've got my work to do.

413
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,244
- I'll give you a hand, Q.
- Thank you.

414
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,996
Don't forget this.

415
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,954
Don't let him teach you
any of his bad habits!

416
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,729
Mr Bond, your table is ready.

417
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:59,101
- I didn't reserve one.
- Your guest is waiting, sir.

418
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,060
This way, please.

419
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,741
Thank you.

420
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,282
You changed your mind.

421
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,406
- I'm glad.
- Are you?

422
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,867
Well, let's put it this way.

423
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:20,171
You are the least lethal and
by far the prettiest of Kamal's friends

424
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,086
that I've come across.

425
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,042
Thank you.

426
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:27,800
So does he have a proposition for me,
or do you?

427
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,016
He suggests a trade.

428
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:35,478
The egg for your life.

429
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:40,771
I'd heard the price of eggs was going up,
but isn't that a little high?

430
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,104
Charge it to, er... Room...

431
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:48,108
Oh, 27.
Along with the champagne, I suppose?

432
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,285
I'll leave it at the desk.

433
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,412
You don't mind?

434
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:56,788
Why? Has Kamal forgotten
what I look like already?

435
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,751
It's for me.

436
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,831
So that if I depart this world suddenly

437
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,292
you'll have something
to remember me by?

438
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,719
Something like that.

439
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:14,643
It's for my scrapbook.
I collect memories.

440
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,765
Well, let's get on with making a few.

441
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,511
- I need refilling.
- Hm?

442
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,593
Of course you do!

443
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,684
Oh. I'll get some more.

444
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:04,393
Don't bother.
We'll make yours a loving cup.

445
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,024
What a good idea.

446
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,612
Forgive my curiosity, but what is that?

447
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,200
That's my little octopussy.

448
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,970
Good morning!

449
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,022
Morning.

450
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:28,692
I didn't want to wake you.
But since you're up,

451
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:30,896
I can say a proper goodbye.

452
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,911
What is the time?

453
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,158
(beeps)

454
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,088
Beautiful view, isn't it?

455
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:57,927
- I don't know how to say goodbye.
- Actions speak louder than words.

456
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,473
You're so right.

457
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:36,677
(man) In! Out! In! Out!

458
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,972
In! Out!

459
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,141
Come on, girls! In!

460
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,093
Out!

461
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,900
Check oars!

462
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,011
(birdsong)

463
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,971
The egg has been recovered.

464
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,771
You should be pleased.

465
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:14,601
(woman) I'm not pleased
it was stolen in the first place.

466
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,604
Nor that the thief
knows enough to bring it here.

467
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:22,157
He's obviously an adventurer
with possible blackmail on his mind.

468
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:26,204
Anyway, I have him as my guest
at the Monsoon Palace.

469
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:29,407
And he will tell us
all he knows very quickly.

470
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,578
- Who is he?
- Englishman.

471
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:37,416
Likes eggs. Preferably Faberge.

472
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,297
And dice. Preferably loaded.

473
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,674
His name is James Bond.

474
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,382
Bring him here.

475
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:50,891
(Kamal) He's dangerous. After he's talked,
we must get rid of him immediately.

476
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,515
No.

477
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:59,445
A "no" from you
has little chance of becoming a "yes".

478
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,569
I assume, therefore,
that the meeting is over.

479
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,071
But you're making a serious mistake.

480
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,594
(beeping)

481
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,743
(beeping quickens)

482
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:23,988
(knock at door)

483
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:33,197
Well, so far I can't complain
about the valet service.

484
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:36,284
Dinner. 8 o'clock.

485
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,213
(locking)

486
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:09,571
- Good evening, Mr Bond.
- Good evening.

487
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,527
Well rested?

488
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,910
I believe you and Miss Magda have met.

489
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:21,416
- It was a pleasure.
- You're too kind.

490
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:26,210
You don't mind if we start?
The soufflé can't wait.

491
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:34,350
At the risk of appearing
to be making light dinner conversation,

492
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,099
may I ask exactly why I am here?

493
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:40,226
I mean, after all, you do have the egg.

494
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,768
True. But we don't have all the answers.

495
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:49,440
Well, supposing, for argument's sake,
I don't feel like talking?

496
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,946
Don't worry, you will.

497
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,073
You will.

498
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:56,451
Let me guess.

499
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,033
Thumbscrews and hot coals.

500
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:03,041
Hardly! We're much more
sophisticated than that.

501
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:10,469
- <i>Er...</i> Sodium Pentothal?
- A bit crude. Very unreliable.

502
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:15,721
We prefer curare with
an effective psychedelic compound.

503
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,718
Guaranteed results.

504
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:22,644
- But with permanent brain damage.
- An unfortunate side effect.

505
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,356
Ah! One of our specialities.

506
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,574
Stuffed sheep's head.

507
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,497
It's odd,

508
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:43,043
but when I'm stared at
I seem to lose my appetite.

509
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,387
Oh, thank you for dinner.

510
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,024
Until tomorrow, then.

511
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:15,735
- Well, I'll say good night.
- I could come in for a nightcap.

512
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,784
Some other time, perhaps.

513
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:29,336
I don't suppose you'd care for a nightcap?

514
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:31,292
No.

515
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,301
(birds screech)

516
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:55,001
(whirr of helicopter)

517
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,212
(INAUDIBLE)

518
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,059
(snoring)

519
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,609
(Kamal) I trust you had a pleasant ﬂight.

520
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:04,282
If you step this way,
I think you will find everything is in order.

521
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,925
(watch beeping)

522
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:43,742
I congratulate you on the quality of
your workmanship, Prince Kamal Khan.

523
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,490
Thank you, General Orlov.

524
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:49,824
As you can see, each piece
has been meticulously duplicated

525
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:53,293
according to Lenkin's specifications.

526
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:56,964
Good! Have it put aboard the helicopter.

527
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:01,006
(gives order in Hindi)

528
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:06,595
<i>(Orlov) Can they be trusted?
(Kamal) I assure you of their silence.</i>

529
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,185
<i>(Kamal) We are both playing
for enormous stakes.</i>

530
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:19,938
I get what I want,
then you get the genuine jewellery.

531
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,147
- Exactly...
- (interference)

532
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:46,301
The precise timing will be essential.

533
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,973
(interference)

534
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:50,551
Remember: nothing must be changed.

535
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:52,724
(interference)

536
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:59,735
<i>(Orlov) One week from today,
in Karl-Marx-Stadt.</i>

537
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,071
- Karl-Marx-Stadt!
- Correct!

538
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,649
(footsteps)

539
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,744
(talking in Hindi)

540
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:13,366
(door shuts)

541
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:25,511
- Everything taken care of?
- As you ordered, Excellence.

542
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:31,350
- So, you recovered it?
- From an accomplice of the thief.

543
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:34,679
He must be eliminated at once!

544
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,104
(crackling)

545
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,353
There must be no further security breach.

546
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:42,778
This fake has caused enough trouble.

547
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,030
I must go.

548
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,872
(Orlov) Everything
has been most satisfactory.

549
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,128
(Kamal) Most kind, General Orlov.

550
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,388
Get Bond!

551
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:01,899
(shouting in Hindi)

552
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:11,158
The Englishman has escaped.

553
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:15,283
He won't go very far. We'll track him.

554
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,093
(shouting and whistling)

555
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,262
(elephant trumpets)

556
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:49,651
Ooh!

557
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,444
Oooh! Ya-ha!

558
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,239
(petrified screams)

559
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,079
Good!

560
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:45,581
Let the sport commence.

561
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,724
Ooh! Agh! Yieeehhh!

562
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,241
(growling)

563
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:22,289
(gives orders in Hindi)

564
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,004
Head him off! Head him off!

565
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,590
(shouting in Hindi)

566
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,547
(roars)

567
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,385
Sit!

568
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,687
We have him! We have him!

569
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,948
Go round! Go round! He's in there!

570
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,361
Hiss off.

571
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:47,833
(birds squawking)

572
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,472
(shouts in Hindi)

573
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,076
(Tarzan-like jungle call)

574
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,872
(Qunfi re)

575
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,294
Ow!

576
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:47,642
Ugh!

577
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,897
(elephant trumpets)

578
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:01,198
Don't let him get away!

579
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,609
(Qunfi re)

580
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,624
(shouts in Hindi)

581
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:23,216
Hey!

582
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:41,692
- C'mom, buddy, c'mon!
- Give him some room.

583
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,069
- Hey, you all right, buddy?
- I'm fine.

584
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:48,529
- Are you with our group?
- No, ma'am. I'm with the economy tour.

585
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:56,503
Mr Bond is indeed a very rare breed.

586
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:59,206
Soon to be made extinct!

587
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:11,222
Genus Hapalochlaena. Produces a venom
that's invariably fatal in seconds.

588
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,178
The barge had that sign.

589
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:17,983
Yes. It belongs to a fabulously wealthy
woman who lives on the floating palace.

590
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,525
Who is she?

591
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:23,276
No one knows her real name,
but she's known as Octopussy.

592
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,616
That's the name I heard at Kamal's.

593
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:30,662
I hear that island's full of
beautiful women. No men allowed.

594
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:34,283
Really? Sexual discrimination.

595
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:37,411
I'll definitely have to pay it a visit.

596
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,856
(sitar music and women laughing)

597
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,807
(gong)

598
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:10,220
Good evening.

599
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:13,807
I wondered when you might arrive.

600
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:16,304
So you are the mysterious Octopussy.

601
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:18,812
And you are James Bond.

602
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,980
007, licensed to kill.

603
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,651
Am I to be your target for tonight?

604
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,112
Not necessarily.

605
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:32,700
Depends how much you tell me
about jewellery smuggling.

606
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,779
And why one of our agents
was killed in East Berlin.

607
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,956
I know nothing about that.

608
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:41,625
You remember Major Dexter Smythe?

609
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:44,875
You were sent out to arrest him,
weren't you?

610
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,582
You seem to have done your homework.

611
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:53,218
Thank you. Yes. Smythe, after a brilliant
military career, joined our secret service.

612
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:58,268
His mission was to recover a cache
of Chinese gold, seized in North Korea.

613
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:01,222
Both he and his native guide disappeared.

614
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,398
The gold was never found.

615
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,693
And 20 years later
you were sent after him.

616
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:15,281
The guide's body turned up with a bullet
still in his skull from Smythe's revolver.

617
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,863
I traced Smythe to Sri Lanka,

618
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:22,121
and gave him 24 hours to clear up
his affairs before I took him back.

619
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:26,455
He committed suicide rather than
face the disgrace of a court martial.

620
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,835
What's the connection?

621
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:36,132
He was my father. I'd hoped
fate would bring us together one day.

622
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:37,887
To avenge him?

623
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:40,889
No. To thank you
for giving him an alternative.

624
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:43,062
(knock at door)

625
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:49,319
Come in.

626
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:52,155
Kamal Khan to see you.

627
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:58,328
Bond has escaped.

628
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:01,532
- How careless of you!
- I apologise.

629
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:05,418
By the way, I'd like you
to meet my new house guest.

630
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:09,748
Er, an old friend of the family,
you might say.

631
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,754
How lovely.

632
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:15,428
You have a nasty habit of surviving.

633
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:18,090
You know what they say about the fittest.

634
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:24,597
Octopussy, I would enjoy another
opportunity to take care of Mr Bond

635
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:28,434
- personally.
- I will take care of Mr Bond myself.

636
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,487
Good night.

637
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,608
And enjoy yourselves.

638
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:39,410
Mr Bond.

639
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:49,876
My father became
a leading authority on octopi.

640
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:53,504
He loved them.
His pet name for me was Octopussy.

641
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:02,017
Mr Bond, smuggling is no concern
of the secret service.

642
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,519
I've violated no British law.

643
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:09,683
You are free to leave, but I'd much prefer
if you stayed as my guest for a few days.

644
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,189
I'd like that.

645
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:16,777
Gwendoline, show Mr Bond to his room.

646
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,697
Good night, Mr Bond.

647
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,621
Till the morning, then.

648
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,411
Midge.

649
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:35,713
Extend Mr Bond every courtesy,
but double the guard on his quarters.

650
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,315
(speaks Hindi)

651
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:00,608
He says the island is heavily guarded.

652
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,865
We don't want to
make enemies with the woman.

653
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,799
(Hindi)

654
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,980
The woman must not be harmed.

655
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:58,041
When Father's gold ran out, the people in
Hong Kong who'd disposed of it for him

656
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:01,424
offered me a commission
to smuggle some diamonds.

657
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:03,675
I discovered I had a talent for it.

658
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:05,882
So you went into business yourself?

659
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:10,391
Yes, but I needed an organisation,
so I revived the old Octopus cult.

660
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:14,432
Well, then.
Where did you recruit all these lovelies?

661
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:18,986
There are many of them
all over Southeast Asia,

662
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:22,656
looking for a guru,
spiritual discipline, who knows what.

663
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:28,080
I train them. Give them a purpose,
a sisterhood and a way of life.

664
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:30,828
- In crime?
- In business.

665
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:35,333
I have diversified into
shipping, hotels, carnivals and circuses.

666
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:43,427
- Is he still there?
- You must be joking!

667
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:47,052
007 on an island
populated exclusively by women?

668
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,804
We won't see him till dawn.

669
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:54,848
- I'll relieve you at midnight.
- No problem!

670
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:11,822
(door opens)

671
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,995
Are we going somewhere?

672
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:21,049
I have to go to Europe tomorrow
on a business trip.

673
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:25,503
Oh, that's a pity.
I was just beginning to enjoy myself.

674
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:28,715
I think you should stay.
I'll only be gone a week.

675
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:32,226
When I come back
we'll discuss the future.

676
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:36,724
Well, I can't guarantee
that I'll be here when you return.

677
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:40,310
Oh, James! We're two of a kind.

678
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:45,357
There are vast rewards for a man
of your talents willing to take risks.

679
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,779
- I'm not for hire.
- Oh! A man of principle!

680
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:52,863
With a price on his head.

681
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:56,076
Naturally,
you do it for Queen and country!

682
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:01,001
I have no country,
I have no price on my head.

683
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:05,130
I don't have to apologise to you,
a paid assassin, for what I am!

684
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,687
No!

685
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,234
You're right.

686
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:28,407
We are two of a kind.

687
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:39,870
Oh, James!

688
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:12,827
(creaking)

689
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,034
?

690
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:25,131
?

691
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:50,114
(birds screech)

692
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:28,069
(birds screech)

693
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:54,220
ls something wrong?

694
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,390
Not really.

695
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:59,558
Just a feeling.

696
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:01,852
Won't you come back to bed?

697
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:25,038
Move!

698
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,793
Hai-ya!

699
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,978
- James!
- Ooh!

700
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,781
Watch it!

701
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,748
Argh!

702
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,496
Come on!

703
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,644
Careful I

704
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,357
Give me the gun!

705
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:47,741
Ooh!

706
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:03,265
(screaming)

707
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:45,595
What happened to Vijay?

708
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:51,389
He was alive when I found him.

709
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:56,235
- Did he say anything?
- All he said was "it was Kamal's men."

710
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:02,275
No more problems.

711
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:09,995
- Better signal M to meet me in Berlin.
- Why?

712
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:13,619
Well, I have to go to a circus
in Karl-Marx-Stadt.

713
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:26,640
We verified the Octopussy Circus
was in East Berlin when we lost 009.

714
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,511
Karl-Marx-Stadt is further east.

715
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:36,146
Why would General Orlov
participate in a jewellery caper?

716
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:40,196
Well, the jewellery, sir,
I think is, if you'll forgive the analogy,

717
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,815
only the tip of the tentacle.

718
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:45,944
Here's the ID you'll need.

719
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:50,202
Charles Moreton, manufacturer's
representative from Leeds.

720
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:53,667
Visiting furniture factories
in East Germany.

721
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:57,212
- Karl will take you in.
- No problem.

722
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,970
Remember, 007, you're on your own.

723
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:10,892
Thank you, sir. That's a great comfort.

724
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,533
(laughter and applause)

725
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,454
<i>Meine Damen und Herren,</i>

01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:17,786
(Grischka counts in Russian
as audience gasps)

730
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:30,763
(fanfare and applause)

731
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,520
(drum roll)

732
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:51,618
Mischka!

733
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:55,034
(wild applause)

734
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:01,291
(marching tune)

735
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:18,478
<i>Meine Damen und Herren,

736
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:21,144

737
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,235

738
01:24:28,272 --> 01:24:30,320
(shouts in Russian)

739
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:44,789

740
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,011

741
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:54,848
(fanfare)

742
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:04,016
(band playing marching tune)

743
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:43,389
<i>...féhrt in wenigen Minuten ab.</i>

744
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:48,694
<i>Achtung, einsteigen. Tiiren schlieBen.
Vorsicht bei der Abfahrt.</i>

745
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:14,174
Of course you know Comrade Borchoi,
the curator of the Hermitage.

746
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,422
He just arrived from Leningrad.

747
01:26:17,547 --> 01:26:19,595
Hm, the Romanov Star.

748
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:32,946
The Romanov Star.

749
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:49,289
<i>Der Sondelzug des Zirkus Octopussy
auf Gleis 2 féhrt in wenigen Minuten ab.</i>

750
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:51,248
<i>Achtung einsteigen...</i>

751
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:11,234
Stay here with the jewellery while
they switch the car to the main track.

752
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,654
You stay, also.

753
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:36,149
100 kiloton yield.

754
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:40,233
The effects are indistinguishable
from the American medium-yield bomb.

755
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:48,658
The detonator. Now listen carefully.
It is pre-set for a four-hour delay.

756
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,834
Set time for the explosion here.

757
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,416
To activate, insert,

758
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:02,922
and twist the lever
a quarter-turn clockwise.

759
01:29:03,046 --> 01:29:07,017
Be at least 20 miles away
when it goes off, hm?

760
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:12,491
The jewellery should net us
300 million in Zurich.

761
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:14,789
We still have to cross the border.

762
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:23,672
I must go.

763
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:25,841
<i>Au</i> revoir, dear lady.

764
01:30:26,296 --> 01:30:28,344
Good luck.

765
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:25,488
Ow!

766
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:27,691
(train horn)

767
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:12,778
Bring the canister!

768
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:25,461
Put it in the car.

769
01:32:32,756 --> 01:32:34,884
Leave that. Let's go.

770
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:38,937
Let's stay. Sit on that box.
Hands on your knees. Come on, move!

771
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:41,815
Why is that bomb on the train?

772
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:47,104
- Who are you?
- I'm British secret service.

773
01:32:50,982 --> 01:32:55,158
You should be more concerned
about getting out of here alive.

774
01:32:55,528 --> 01:33:00,159
I am more concerned about an atomic
bomb exploding on a US Air Force base.

775
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:04,621
You can't be inviting a nuclear war!
What happens when the US retaliates?

776
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:07,169
Against whom?

777
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:11,587
My God. Of course.

778
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:16,175
Our early-warning system will rule out
the bomb having come from Russia

779
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:18,351
or anywhere else.

780
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:23,353
Everyone will assume incorrectly that
it was a US bomb triggered accidentally.

781
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:27,944
That would be
the most plausible explanation.

782
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:30,989
Europe will insist on disarmament,

783
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:34,785
leaving every border undefended
for you to walk across at will.

784
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:36,953
It doesn't matter a damn to you

785
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:40,703
that thousands of innocent people
will die in your accident!

786
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:44,036
Better than letting
a handful of old men in Moscow

787
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:48,295
bargain away our advantage
in disarmament talks!

788
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:51,377
On your feet, General!
You're going to stop that train.

789
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:53,674
(train whistle)

790
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:58,342
- It's too late.
- You can stop it at the border.

791
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:08,060
(Orlov) Kill him! Kill him!

792
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:24,667
(train whistle)

793
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:34,427
Kill him! Kill him!

794
01:34:40,175 --> 01:34:42,269
(men shouting)

795
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:46,106
Get to the station!

796
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:57,033
Stop that car!

797
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:30,483
Stop!

798
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:34,817
Follow that car!

799
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:28,792
(whistle screaming)

800
01:36:39,877 --> 01:36:41,971
<i>Ach du Iieber Golf!</i>

801
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:24,347
Kamal Khan says we are to stay here
until we cross the border.

802
01:37:33,348 --> 01:37:35,851
The license plate is General Orlov's.

803
01:37:37,018 --> 01:37:39,112
We have discovered this.

804
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:46,032
- Where is General Orlov now?
- Last reported heading for the border.

805
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,464
<i>Guten Tag.</i>

806
01:38:34,784 --> 01:38:36,832
(guard's whistle)

807
01:39:14,198 --> 01:39:16,326
I must get to that train!

808
01:39:17,285 --> 01:39:19,788
<i>Halt! Stehen bleiben!</i>

809
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,963
Stop!

810
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:40,729
A common thief!

811
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:43,228
A disgrace to the uniform.

812
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:46,990
Yes. But tomorrow,

813
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:50,409
I shall be a hero

814
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:53,864
of the Soviet Union.

815
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:02,372
(train whistle)

816
01:40:23,893 --> 01:40:26,271
It is now 11.45.

817
01:40:26,354 --> 01:40:30,234
The performance begins at 3.
Allowing for delays,

818
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:33,369
set the bomb to detonate at 3.45.

819
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:53,639
We must leave the base by 3.15.

820
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:57,639
I take it none of you will be late.

821
01:41:12,108 --> 01:41:13,985
(clatter)

822
01:41:29,834 --> 01:41:31,962
Hai-ya!

823
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:37,401
Argh!

824
01:43:13,062 --> 01:43:14,279
The jewellery!

825
01:43:14,397 --> 01:43:16,866
- Did you recognise him?
- No.

826
01:43:16,941 --> 01:43:19,035
Stay here with her.

827
01:43:28,077 --> 01:43:30,045
Ooh! Argh!

828
01:43:35,793 --> 01:43:37,466
Ahhhh!

829
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:46,641
Argh!

830
01:44:06,824 --> 01:44:08,326
On the roof. Trouble!

831
01:44:34,018 --> 01:44:35,520
Mischka!

832
01:44:47,364 --> 01:44:49,287
(both scream)

833
01:45:02,338 --> 01:45:04,215
Ooh!

834
01:45:11,806 --> 01:45:13,479
And this

835
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:16,402
for my brother.

836
01:45:19,188 --> 01:45:21,065
Argh!

837
01:45:22,233 --> 01:45:24,327
And that's for 009.

838
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:28,573
(cheering and whistling)

839
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:01,781

(derisory laughter)

844
01:47:05,085 --> 01:47:07,588
Gobinda will stay with the jewellery.

859
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:57,282
General, excuse me. I have some travel
arrangements to make. Enjoy the show.

860
01:48:57,364 --> 01:49:00,368
- Thank you.
- I'm sure he'll get a big blast out of this!

861
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:02,954
I know he won't be disappointed.

862
01:49:22,389 --> 01:49:24,483

- That was Bond.
- Good! Let him keep going.

867
01:50:30,874 --> 01:50:33,218
He'll be late and we'll be rid of him too!

868
01:50:37,881 --> 01:50:39,349
Great, isn't it?

869

870
01:50:46,515 --> 01:50:48,563
Fantastic! Fantastic!

01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:54,906
Marvellous!

872
01:50:55,023 --> 01:50:58,823
General, how long would I get
in the brig if I stole your wallet?

873
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:01,405
- Er, about two years.
- That long?

874
01:51:01,488 --> 01:51:04,412
Well, in that case, I'd better return it!

875
01:51:04,533 --> 01:51:06,126
Son of a gun!

876
01:51:16,086 --> 01:51:19,511
- Where's the Base Commander?
- Let's see your circus pass.

877
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:22,844
- Damn it, man, it's urgent!
- (sirens)

878
01:51:22,926 --> 01:51:24,769
Get out, put your hands up!

879
01:51:29,349 --> 01:51:31,272
<i>Gestohlenes Auto!</i>

880
01:51:33,228 --> 01:51:37,278
Captain, some nut went through in
a stolen car. Wants the Base Commander.

881
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:39,072
He's wearing a red shirt.

882
01:51:41,904 --> 01:51:43,872
There he is! There he is!

883
01:51:46,867 --> 01:51:48,961
Go after that guy in the red shirt.

884
01:51:49,077 --> 01:51:51,250
He's ducked behind the trailers.

885
01:52:11,308 --> 01:52:15,313
Keep searching, you guys.
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

886
01:52:18,315 --> 01:52:20,488
Look under the trailer, you guys.

887
01:52:51,431 --> 01:52:55,527
<i>- (compére) Ladies and gentlemen...
- Hey! Is anyone else in there?</i>

888
01:52:55,644 --> 01:53:02,869
<i>And now for the first time in this country,
the death-defying human cannonball!</i>

889
01:53:03,193 --> 01:53:07,790
<i>I have the pleasure in presenting to you
Francisco the Fearless!</i>

890
01:53:15,163 --> 01:53:17,712
The suspect's wearing a clown suit. Over.

891
01:53:25,799 --> 01:53:28,052
That's him!

892
01:53:32,055 --> 01:53:34,399
Hold it, buddy! You're coming with us.

893
01:53:50,574 --> 01:53:55,000
- General, there's a bomb in that cannon.
- Sure! Where else would a bomb be?

894
01:53:55,078 --> 01:53:59,254
- Great clown!
- I'm deadly serious! I'm a British agent!

895
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:02,344
- What?
- For God's sake, tell him who I am!

896
01:54:02,419 --> 01:54:07,220
Kamal and Orlov double-crossed you.
I saw them take the jewellery off the train!

897
01:54:08,425 --> 01:54:10,769
Does that convince you?

898
01:54:10,886 --> 01:54:15,266
Sir, that bomb is set to explode at 3.45.
That's 90 seconds from now!

899
01:54:15,349 --> 01:54:18,023
General, this man's either drunk or crazy.

900
01:54:25,567 --> 01:54:27,695
He'll destroy the entire operation.

901
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:49,133
You two, grab that man!
Grab him! Hold him!

902
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:52,477
(Bond) Damn it! Let go!

903
01:54:52,636 --> 01:54:54,730
Let me go, there's a bomb in there!

904
01:54:54,805 --> 01:54:56,899
(gasping)

905
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,654
(screaming)

906
01:55:07,401 --> 01:55:09,495
Let him go!

907
01:55:10,654 --> 01:55:12,497
Quiet, everyone! Quiet!

908
01:55:23,458 --> 01:55:25,506
(gasp from crowd)

909
01:55:28,839 --> 01:55:31,183
- Now?
- (riotous laughter)

910
01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:33,594
Thank you. You did a great job.

911
01:55:34,261 --> 01:55:36,434
Where was Kamal going?

912
01:55:36,513 --> 01:55:38,857
Back to India.

913
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:48,026
<i>(General) Folks, we've had an emergency,
but everything is all right now.</i>

914
01:55:48,108 --> 01:55:50,531
<i>You and your families are safe.</i>

915
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:56,367
<i>Now, please leave the tent
in an orderly manner. Thank you.</i>

916
01:55:59,995 --> 01:56:03,374
- The plane is refuelled.
- We'll take off at sunrise.

917
01:56:03,457 --> 01:56:06,677
- Are the gold certificates on board?
- Yes, Excellence.

918
01:56:08,295 --> 01:56:12,300
We'll take these also.
Dollars, pounds, francs, marks.

919
01:56:12,382 --> 01:56:14,476
I can always print my own.

920
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:16,679
(music and laughter)

921
01:56:17,721 --> 01:56:21,646
- What is that?
- Girls selling themselves.

922
01:56:21,725 --> 01:56:25,070
Good. It will keep the men occupied.

923
01:56:25,187 --> 01:56:27,315
I don't want them to see me leave.

924
01:56:36,156 --> 01:56:38,033
NOW!

925
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:46,675
Argh!

926
01:56:48,001 --> 01:56:50,095
Give us a hand.

927
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:29,635
Come on! Shh!

928
01:57:52,816 --> 01:57:54,944
Let's go. All set?

929
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:07,673
Lift!

930
01:58:12,836 --> 01:58:14,964
That's it. Steady.

931
01:58:24,514 --> 01:58:28,360
- Make sure the horses are saddled.
- Yes, Excellence.

932
01:58:28,476 --> 01:58:30,524
I'll join you in a few minutes.

933
01:58:44,451 --> 01:58:48,627
- Do you really think you can escape me?
- Orlov betrayed us.

934
01:58:49,456 --> 01:58:52,300
I swear I knew nothing about the bomb.

935
01:58:52,375 --> 01:58:58,849
We're partners, we're friends. Octopussy,
I would never do anything to hurt you.

936
01:59:08,683 --> 01:59:10,856
(gives order in Hindi)

937
01:59:11,353 --> 01:59:15,574
You left me to be killed
along with thousands of innocent people!

938
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:17,363
Octopussy.

939
01:59:17,734 --> 01:59:19,407
Octopussy.

940
01:59:20,654 --> 01:59:23,373
Look! I was bringing you this.

941
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:25,663
We can make millions.

942
01:59:25,742 --> 01:59:27,665
(alarm bell)

943
01:59:30,205 --> 01:59:32,924
Take her! She's our ticket out of here.

944
01:59:55,689 --> 01:59:59,694
- I trust you can handle this contraption.
- It goes by hot air.

945
01:59:59,776 --> 02:00:01,870
Oh, then you can!

946
02:00:11,121 --> 02:00:14,796
(Q) They're doing fine.
(Bond) But I don't see Octopussy.

947
02:00:31,641 --> 02:00:34,770
- There she is! She's in trouble!
- Get your hands off me!

948
02:00:35,145 --> 02:00:37,273
- (Q) I'll take her down.
- No! Up!

949
02:00:38,314 --> 02:00:43,115
Where are you going?
Look, don't be an idiot, 007. Come back!

950
02:00:51,995 --> 02:00:53,668
Kill him!

951
02:01:04,841 --> 02:01:06,514
(Hindi)

952
02:02:12,909 --> 02:02:14,752
(gasping)

953
02:02:17,997 --> 02:02:20,091
Come on!

954
02:02:23,086 --> 02:02:26,260
What are you doing?
Cut it out! We haven't time for that!

955
02:02:26,381 --> 02:02:28,429
- Ah.
- Later perhaps.

956
02:02:53,366 --> 02:02:55,460
Come on! Giddap!

957
02:03:09,716 --> 02:03:12,390
Come on! Come on!

958
02:03:34,657 --> 02:03:36,785
(rattling)

959
02:04:39,847 --> 02:04:43,477
He'll kill us all! Go out and get him!

960
02:04:43,559 --> 02:04:45,653
- Out there?
- Go!

961
02:04:46,062 --> 02:04:47,735
Yes, Excellence.

962
02:05:22,515 --> 02:05:24,609
Aaagghh!

963
02:06:08,311 --> 02:06:10,985
- Jump!
- Ohhhhh!

964
02:06:13,483 --> 02:06:16,157
Oh, no! Oh, no!

965
02:06:34,629 --> 02:06:40,011
My government categorically denies
the incident ever occurred.

966
02:06:41,427 --> 02:06:45,853
However, we request Bond to return
one of our most historic treasures,

967
02:06:45,932 --> 02:06:47,605
the Romanov Star.

968
02:06:47,683 --> 02:06:52,189
In the interests of our Anglo-Soviet
relationships, that can be arranged.

969
02:06:52,271 --> 02:06:55,195
Ah, where is Commander Bond?

970
02:06:55,274 --> 02:07:00,952
Well, owing to the serious nature of his
injuries, he's still not fit enough to travel.

971
02:07:01,114 --> 02:07:05,119
In! Out! In! Out!

972
02:07:19,507 --> 02:07:21,555
- I wish...
- What?

973
02:07:23,886 --> 02:07:26,856
I wish you weren't
in such a weakened condition.

974
02:07:28,307 --> 02:07:30,401
Oh, James!

975
02:07:33,813 --> 02:07:34,860
Mmmm!

976
02:07:36,858 --> 02:07:38,280
James!

977

<i>For an hour or two</i>

980
02:07:54,542 --> 02:07:58,547
