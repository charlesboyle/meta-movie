71
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,394
All our theories about raptor intelligence,

72
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,313
what they were capable of,
we weren't even close.

73
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,523
Tell me.

74
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,358
We did cranial scans of a fossil skull

75
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:02,695
and found what looks to be a very
sophisticated resonating chamber.

76
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,864
Wait a second.
So we were right.

77
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,449
They'd the ability to vocalize.

78
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,534
lt's the key to their social intelligence.

79
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,786
Which explains why they could work as a team.

80
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,621
They'd coordinate attacks so their prey

81
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,373

00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,875

00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,632

94
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,762
that we can determine the correlation

95
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,264
between the upper palate and the larynx.

96
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,476
This lets us theorize, theorize, mind you,

97
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,730
that the raptor was capable of
sophisticated vocalizations

98
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,983
which would have been a tremendous
evolutionary advantage.

99
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:27,530
Raptors were fierce, intelligent
and socially sophisticated.

100
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:31,367
They were able to hunt in numbers
and coordinate their efforts.

101
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,579
Were it not for the cataclysmic
events which overtook them,

102
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,916
it's entirely possible that
raptors, rather than humans,

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,461
would have become the dominant
species on this planet.

105
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,384

My card.
How you doing, Billy?

181
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,857
What can I do for you,
Mr. Kirby?

182
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,069
First thing, I'm a great admirer of yours.

183
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,239
And I have a proposition
I'd like to discuss with you.

184
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,783
Would you have dinner with
my wife and me this evening?

185
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,118
lt'll be our treat.

186
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,578
That'd be great but

187
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,873
I'm tired, I've been traveling.
Maybe some other time.

188
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,417
Believe me, this will be worth your while.

189
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,585
We'd love to.

190
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,087
Oh, terrific!
That's the spirit. Good.

191
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,714
This evening then.

thank you for coming.

194
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,642
Dr. Grant,
how are you?

195
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,687
Amanda, this is
Billy and Dr. Grant.

196
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,980
Mrs. Kirby,
how are you?

197
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,565
What are you boys drinking?

198
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,569

Two, please, Cat.

199
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,905
We've admired your work for years.

200
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,740
Really.
Truly inspiring.

201
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,117
Amanda and I just love the outdoors.

202
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:50,412
We've been on nearly every adventure
tour they can come up with:

203
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,665
The Nile, Galápagos, K2.

204
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,503
We even have two seats reserved on the
first commercial flight to the moon.

205
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,922
For our wedding anniversary this year,

206
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,965
we wanted to do something really special.

207
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,468
Something. ..
Once in a lifetime.

208
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:08,055
I've chartered an airplane
to fly us over lsla Sorna.

209
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,474
And we'd like you to be our guide.

210
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,144
There you go, guys.

211
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,733
That's a very kind offer, Mr.
Kirby, but I'm a very, very busy man.

212
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,070
I can recommend a couple of guys who
are really highly qualified. ..

213
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,031
No, no.
You're the best.

214
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,741
You've seen these animals in the flesh.

215
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,826
There's no one who comes close to you.

216
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:34,248
You wouldn't be able to fly low enough
to see anything of any real interest.

217
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,583
See, that's the interesting part,

218
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,044
because we have permission to fly low.

219
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,295
BILLY: How low?

220
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:44,758
I'm no aviation expert, but a heck
of a lot lower than anybody else.

221
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,385
From what I understand,

222
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,637
it's pretty much whatever we want.

223
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,014
That's hard to believe.

224
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,058
Through my business dealings,

225
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,018

226
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,187
I've made a lot of friends in high places.

227
00:14:57,272 --> 00:15:00,023
ln this case, the Costa Rican government.

228
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,651
Dr. Grant,
you have no idea

229
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,279
how important it is that you come along.

230
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,655
lt would make all the difference.

231
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,781
Mrs. Kirby, I. ..

232
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,575
And, of course, we'd love to make

233
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,660
a contribution to your research here.

234
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,704
So,

235
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,001
I could write all kinds of numbers
on this check, Dr. Grant.

236
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:20,836
Tell me,

237
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,257
what's it gonna take?

238
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:42,399
Even with what I pay you,
couldn't you afford a better bag?

239
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,692
No way.

240
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,694
This one's lucky.

241
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,906
Couple of years ago, some
buddies and I went hang gliding

242
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,992
off these cliffs in New Zealand.

243
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:56,997
And this big updraft came and swept
me right against the side. Wham!

244
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,124
That does sound lucky.

245
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,336
lt was this strap alone that saved my life.

246
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,880
Got hooked on a rock as I was falling.

Alan, I want to thank you for bringing me along.

249
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,892
The bones will still be there when we get back.

250
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,478
That's the great thing about bones.
They never run away.

251
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:24,358
And truth is, you got me into this.

252
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:29,404
And I have no intention of being
on my own with these people.

253
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,326
Don't get too excited.

254
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,244
Chances are, we won't see a thing.

look out the left of the plane,

Stop, please.

lt's time you did some
explaining, Mr. Kirby.

375
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,125
We called everyone.
We did everything we could.

376
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,335
No one would help us.

377
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,004

that's our U.S. Embassy,

told us we should accept the inevitable.
Can you believe that?

You let a 12-year-old
go parasailing alone?

No!

382
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,682

He was with a friend.

All right, why me?

386
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,483
He said we needed someone who'd
been on the island before.

387
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,736
Yes, but I did not tell you to kidnap somebody.

388
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,781
I have never been on this island.

389
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,241
Sure you have.
You wrote that book.

390
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:26,788
That was lsla Nublar.
This is lsla Sorna, Site B.

391
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,956
You mean there are two islands with dinosaurs?

392
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,375
Stay out of this.

393
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,001

Billy. We'll go back to the
plane, salvage what we can.

397
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,053
Then we make for the coast.

398
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,723
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving
this island without our son.

399
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,267
Then you can go and look for him.

400
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,187
Or you can stick with us, as
long as you don't hold us up.

Either way,

402
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,983
you probably won't get off this island alive.

00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,747
So? What do we do?

404
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,917
We search for your son

lt's nothing you haven't seen before, Paul.

How much weight did you say you lost?

410
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,837
About 25 pounds.
I've been swimming.

411
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,883
Swimming? You hate to swim.
You don't even know how to swim.

412
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,801
I know. I learned.

413
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,887
You look good.

414
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,096

416
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,019
How would you classify it, Billy?

417
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,395
Well. ..

418
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,148
it's a super-predator.

419
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,985
A Suchomimus.

420
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,905
That snout.
No, think bigger.

421
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,491
Baryonyx?
Not with that sail.

422
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,203
Spinosaurus aegypticus.

423
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,500
I don't remember that on lnGen's list.

424
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,959
Because it wasn't on their list.

425
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,962
And it makes you wonder
what else they were up to.

426
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,601
So, Mr. Kirby, tell me.

427
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:58,231
When you climbed K2, did you base
camp at 25,000 or 30,000 feet?

428
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,902
30,000 feet. We were
pretty close to the top.

429
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,696
You were about 1,000 feet above it, actually.

430
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,116
No, that's a common mistake.

431
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,621
There's no such thing as
Kirby Enterprises, is there?

433
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,126

435
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,549

you wrote us is any good.

I will pay you the money I owe you.

437
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,553
This is good.

00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,099
Here we are, in the worst place in
the world, and we're not being paid!

439

I'll make this up to you.

or a kitchen. ..

Quiet.

Would you stop that?

Dr. Grant says this is
very dangerous territory.

452
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,346
Maybe we should split up.
We could cover twice as much.

453
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,015
Dr. Grant says
that's a bad idea.

454
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,600
Dr. Grant says this. ..

455
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,394
Why hire an expert if we don't use his advice?

456
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,272
Except Dr. Grant
isn't looking for Eric.

457
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,607
He's looking for the coast.

Go ahead and scream.

Don't worry about that.

00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,489
What? What did you say?

462
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,116
What did you say?

463
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,618
Never mind!
Paul, just drop it!

464
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,871

they're still in the vicinity.

That's my camera.

472
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,211
I've got an idea.

473
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,755
Let me have the camera.

485
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,458
I can't see.
I can't do it!

487
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:11,924
One, two, three!

488
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,512
Are you okay, buddy?
I'm gonna drop myself down now.

489

490
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,062

I know he's alive.

Maybe.

Okay, you're free.

00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,471
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about Ben.

there all by himself.

I know, I know.

Our baby is out here all by himself.

512
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,365
Listen to me.
We'll find him.

513
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,242
I promise.

Paul.

515
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,589
PAUL: Dr. Grant!

516
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,634
You should come look at this!

00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,166
(WHISPERS) Raptor.

518
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,055
PAUL: We're going to find him.

519
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,683
Are you listening to me?
We're going to find him.

520
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,518
Kid's got resources.

521
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:12,021
Remember what it was like to try to ground him?

522
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,649
Where's Billy?

523
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,949
What are you doing?

524
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,784
I was photographing the nest.

525
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,953
Don't do that again.

526
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,080
I'm sorry.

527
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,335
lf I lose you, it's just
me and the damn tourists.

528
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,803

Eric is in there.

529

01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,285
How do you know that she can help us?

899
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,371
She's the one person I could always count on.

900
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:30,663
I owe her a lot.

901
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:33,708
I don't think I ever told her that.

902
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:34,834
You should.

903
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:39,130
You hear that?

904
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,966

(SCREECHING)

906
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,235
They want the eggs.

907
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,488
Otherwise, we'd be dead already.

912
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,268
She thinks you stole the eggs.

913
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:34,477
Get behind me.

918
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:19,898

Dr. Alan Grant?

AMANDA: Stop!

927
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:45,900
That's a very bad idea!

Second Squad, move!
Wow!

929
01:21:57,454 --> 01:22:01,082
You have to thank her now.
She sent the Navy and the Marines.

930
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,586
God bless you, Ellie.

931
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:19,183
Dr. Grant, is this man with you?
What?

932
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:30,528
You made it.

933
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:33,281
Yeah.

934
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:35,867

we need to go now!

Oh, yeah.

Where do you think they're going?

945
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:30,672
I don't know. Maybe just looking
for new nesting grounds.

946
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,757
lt's a whole new world for them.

947
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:35,259
I dare them to nest in Enid, Oklahoma.
