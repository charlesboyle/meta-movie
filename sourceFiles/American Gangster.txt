1
00:01:49,057 --> 00:01:51,893
Happy Thanksgiving!

2
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:55,773
Come here!

3
00:01:59,443 --> 00:02:00,486
Yeah!
Right here!

4
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:02,279
Toss me a bird, Bumpy!

5
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:03,782
Bumpy!

6
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:07,077
Yeah!
Bumpy! We love you!

7
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:08,787
There you go, darling.

8
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:12,166
Over here! Over here!

9
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:17,588
Frank! Come on!

10
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,256
Come here.

11
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:36,235
This is the problem.
This is what's wrong with America.

12
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:40,572
It's gotten so big,
you just can't find your way.

13
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,495
The grocery store
on the corner is now a supermarket.

14
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:48,915
The candy store is a McDonald's.

15
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,963
And this place,
a super-fucking discount store.

16
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:57,258
Where's the pride of ownership, huh?

17
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:00,470
Where's the personal service?

18
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:10,273
You see what I mean? Shit.

19
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:16,780
I mean, what right do they have,
of cutting out the suppliers,

20
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:20,325
pushing out all the middlemen,

21
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:24,455
buying direct from the manufacturer?

22
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:29,210
Sony this, Toshiba that.

23
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:33,299
All them Chinks
putting Americans out of work.

24
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:42,434
That's the way it is now.

25
00:03:45,937 --> 00:03:47,564
You all right?

26
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:50,443
You can't find the heart of anything

27
00:03:52,278 --> 00:03:54,072
to stick the knife.

28
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:57,785
Hey!

29
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,162
Anybody here?

30
00:04:00,788 --> 00:04:01,789
Can I help you?

31
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:03,248
Call an ambulance.

32
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:05,085
Forget it, Frank.

33
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:08,880
There's no one in charge.

34
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:15,513
Call an ambulance!

35
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:19,141
Some say
Bumpy Johnson was a great man,

36
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:22,604
according to the eulogies, a giving man,
a man of the people.

37
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,398
No one chose to use in their remembrances

38
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:28,610
the word most often associated with
Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson, "Gangster,"

39
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,323
whose passing has brought a who's who
of mourners on this chilly afternoon.

40
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:36,661
Lucchese mob boss Dominic Cattano,
Harlem crime figure Nicky Barnes.

41
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:37,830
Nicky! Nicky!

42
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:39,081
From the political arena,

43
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:41,583
the Governor has come down,
the Mayor of New York,

44
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:46,047
and Chief of Police and Commissioner,
sports and entertainment luminaries:

45
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:49,342
Bumpy Johnson,
age 62 when he passed,

46
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:52,971
was a folk hero among
Harlem locals for over four decades:

47
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:55,474
Regarded by some
as the Robin Hood of Harlem,

48
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,435
by others as a ruthless criminal:::

49
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,270
I don't understand, you know.

50
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:03,608
I would've thought that Bumpy would
put out a better spread, you know?

51
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:05,569
-You want something?
-No, thanks.

52
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:07,320
I want chicken wings at my funeral.

53
00:05:07,446 --> 00:05:09,949
All right, Nicky Barnes.
Who is that?

54
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:11,784
He didn't know what hit him,
you know what I'm saying?

55
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:14,203
I just kept popping him
in the face 'cause that's what I do.

56
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:17,958
Mmm.

57
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,713
I don't have a lighter. You have a light?

58
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,135
Oh.

59
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:34,894
Okay?

60
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:36,979
That's very good.

61
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:38,814
Hey, Frank.

62
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,904
Go get me a light while you're at it.

63
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:46,948
Appreciate it.

64
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:49,159
Don Cattano.

65
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:51,370
Hey, how you doing, Rossi?

66
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:52,747
Good.

67
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:54,040
Would you like a drink, sir?

68
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:56,876
Give him a scotch on the rocks.

69
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:04,051
Come on. Come on.

70
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,481
I know you're hurting, Frank.

71
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,274
So am I.

72
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:18,943
I'm all right.

73
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:21,570
-You gonna be all right?
-Yeah.

74
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:24,324
I'm sure Bumpy didn't say
anything to you, but he made me promise

75
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,701
that if anything ever happened to him,

76
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:29,996
that I should make sure
that you want for nothing.

77
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,917
I appreciate that.

78
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:37,255
You know, half the people in this room
owed Bumpy money when he died.

79
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,509
They think I'm gonna forget to collect,
but I'm gonna get that money.

80
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,720
Well, that's the spirit. Go get 'em.

81
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:49,067
Mr Roberts,
taking the prosecution's side,

82
00:06:49,102 --> 00:06:50,645
Mr Roberts,
taking the prosecution's side,

83
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:54,942
give us US v: Mead,
subject, issues, what the determination was

84
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:57,528
and what it means to us today.

85
00:06:57,987 --> 00:07:02,492
Class, you'll be critiquing Mr Roberts,
so pay attention.

86
00:07:04,828 --> 00:07:06,955
I hate hearing my name called,
you know?

87
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,958
It means I gotta get up in front of the class,
I gotta turn around,

88
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:14,172
and I know every one of those people there,
they know more than I do.

89
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:18,301
The number one fear of people,
it ain't dying, it's public speaking.

90
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:19,803
I get physically ill, I wanna throw up.

91
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:21,680
And that's what you wanna do for a living.

92
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:23,974
No, I don't wanna be like that, man,
I wanna beat it.

93
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:25,142
So, should I do this?

94
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:27,645
No, he'll take it from me, he knows me.
I've known him since high school.

95
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:30,190
-From high school?
-Good morning. Yeah.

96
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:32,358
He doesn't take it, just throw it in.
It's good service.

97
00:07:32,525 --> 00:07:34,987
-Throw it in? All right.
-Yeah.

98
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,865
What's up, Susie?
-Hey, Jay.

99
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,867
-How you doing, baby?
-All right.

100
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:41,327
All right. Ready?

101
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:00,015
Hey! That's his head!

102
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:11,653
You're supposed to be my friend,
asshole!

103
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,864
CAMPIZl: I swear to God, Richie,
I didn't know it was you.

104
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,369
I would never slam a door
on your hand, knowingly.

105
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:19,578
You bit my fucking hand.

106
00:08:19,703 --> 00:08:21,372
What are you doing
serving subpoenas, anyway?

107
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,500
We're on loan to County.
-County?

108
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,669
-How's that working out for you?
Hey, fuck you.

109
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:29,881
Hey, I'm sorry. Consider me served.
Can we leave it there?

110
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:32,885
Assault on a police officer? I don't think so.

111
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,722
Hey, for old times' sake. What can we do?
What do you want? What can I give you?

112
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:39,142
What do you get for assault
with a deadly weapon, Jay?

113
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,103
-Five years minimum.
Five years.

114
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:45,357
Guys, come on. No, guys.
What do you want? Who do you want?

115
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,900
Who do you got?

116
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:51,656
You want Big Al's bookie? You want
his accountant? I'll give him to you.

117
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,251
CAMPIZl: Stop, stop, stop.

118
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,546
There he is.

119
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,217
That's him. That's the bookie.

120
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,052
All right, Carlo, get lost.

121
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:12,764
-Right here?
-Yeah, right here. Get out of the car.

122
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:16,684
CAMPIZl: This is... I'd rather not.
Come on. Let's go.

123
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:18,519
Take it ease.

124
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,127
Want to stay with him or the car?

125
00:09:40,294 --> 00:09:42,755
Let's see who comes for the car.

126
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:58,981
Think he made us?

127
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,860
You called in the warrants, right?
So, where are they?

128
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:03,487
I just called, man.

129
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:07,407
I called and walked back here
and 10 seconds has gone by.

130
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:11,746
I saw him with the slips, Jay.

131
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:15,542
You saw policy slips? You saw
grocery bags. You don't know what's in 'em.

132
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:18,045
Yes, I do and so do you.
Don't give me that bull.

133
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,132
What's the rush, Richie?
Half an hour, the warrant will be here.

134
00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:25,011
-I got night school, all right?
-Guess you're gonna miss it.

135
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:34,439
Fuck this. Come on.
-You sure?

136
00:10:34,564 --> 00:10:36,524
Yeah, I'm sure. Let's go.

137
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:30,919
Fuck.

138
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,047
-Jay.
-Yeah?

139
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:41,722
Fuck.

140
00:11:46,061 --> 00:11:48,355
WBZ, honey bunch,
the show they all love!

141
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,774
It's the groovy sound
of the Jefferson Kaye Saturday Night Show:

142
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:53,069
Dig, honey, it's coming up time for news:

143
00:11:53,194 --> 00:11:55,822
Jumping on the ceiling,
wallpaper peeling on WBZ:

144
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:58,282
Stick around, the Jace-man's got 10:
Back in 10:

145
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:07,501
It's not just a couple of bucks, all right?

146
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,254
It's the same thing in principle.

147
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:11,548
Oh, are we talking principles?

148
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:15,385
Richie, a cop who turns
in this kind of money, says one thing.

149
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,973
He turns in cops who take money.
We'll be fucking pariahs.

150
00:12:19,098 --> 00:12:20,516
Yeah, well, then we're fucked both ways.

151
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:23,394
Not if we keep it. Only if we don't,
then you're right, we're fucked.

152
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,397
But not if we keep it.

153
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:28,692
God damn it, man! Did we ask for this?

154
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:31,778
Did we put a gun to someone's head
and say, "Give us your money"?

155
00:12:31,903 --> 00:12:35,658
Cops kill cops they can't trust.

156
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:41,290
We can't turn it in, man.

157
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:52,385
Can you believe that?

158
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:03,022
How much is it?

159
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:05,942
$987,000.

160
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:10,572
Well, what happened to the rest of it?

161
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:15,328
What the hell are you doing
counting it out here in front of everybody?

162
00:13:15,453 --> 00:13:16,871
Are you nuts?

163
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:22,002
Get it back in the bags, seal them up
and down into the property room.

164
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:33,431
You fucking Boy Scout.

165
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:00,670
What? What?

166
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,658
Detective Trupo, sign here.

167
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,664
You guys ready to make
a lot of fucking money?

168
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,124
Always.
Hell, yeah.

169
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,334
Fucking A.

170
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:38,963
Oh, look at this.

171
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,214
There you go.

172
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:43,719
All right, look at this.
Fucking beautiful.

173
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:45,679
There's three more boats.

174
00:14:53,229 --> 00:14:55,398
Hey, don't lose any of that shit.

175
00:14:55,565 --> 00:14:57,859
I know.
All right, be careful.

176
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:03,324
Hey! Just enough for the reagent test.

177
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,870
A little less.

178
00:15:12,584 --> 00:15:14,879
ROSSl: This is the French Connection dope:

179
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:19,300
Kilos of the same dope
Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso took from us:

180
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:21,677
The cops seize it, arrest everyone,

181
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:24,181
then they start taking it out
of the evidence room,

182
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:27,768
whacking it down to nothing
and selling it back to us:

183
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,270
They basically control the market with it:

184
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,941
Mr Rossi, I have a surprise for you.

185
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,069
ROSSl: They've been doing it for years now:
They live off it, our dope:

186
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:37,195
What do you think?

187
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,156
What the fuck is happening
to the world, Frank?

188
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:41,534
Those fucking crooks.

189
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:43,744
Yeah. Sad about Bumpy.

190
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:48,500
Things are never gonna
be the same in Harlem.

191
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:53,630
You walk down the street, nobody bothers
you 'cause Bumpy was making sure of it.

192
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,258
Half a key.

193
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,552
How is your day now?

194
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:00,221
It's chaos. Every gorilla for hisself.

195
00:16:03,183 --> 00:16:04,852
Motherfucker!

196
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:11,276
Who can live like that?
There has to be order.

197
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:13,528
That would never happen with Italians.

198
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:17,365
More important than any one man's life,
is order.

199
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,750
Frank.

200
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:30,338
Hey. Come on in, Claude. Sit down.

201
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,430
How y'all doing, huh?
-Good.

202
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,931
So, you see Nate over there? Yeah?

203
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:40,349
Yeah, all the time.

204
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:42,518
-Nate is everywhere. He's good.
-Yeah.

205
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:44,813
-He's still over there?
-Yeah. He's got himself a club now.

206
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,441
-Okay. Whereabouts, Saigon?
Bangkok.

207
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:50,569
-Bangkok?
-I don't think he's ever coming home.

208
00:16:54,824 --> 00:16:55,950
Come on.

209
00:17:22,438 --> 00:17:25,192
On the house, for our boys in uniform.

210
00:17:25,317 --> 00:17:28,278
Thank you, sugar. That's very kind.

211
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:30,155
Thank Frank.

212
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,740
Thanks, Frank.

213
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:34,744
Just relax.

214
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:38,873
You have to boot this shit a couple of times.

215
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:42,962
The cops keep cutting it, selling the shit.

216
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:48,176
I don't want to say anything,
'cause the price is right,

217
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:51,471
but that shit in Nam is way,

218
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,269
way heavy.

219
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,257
Did you ain't seen the jar, Frank?

220
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:26,177
I think you walked right past it.

221
00:18:26,302 --> 00:18:30,223
The money jar, Frank.
What do I gotta do, put a fucking sign on it?

222
00:18:30,348 --> 00:18:31,433
Hmm?

223
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:36,814
Look at this nigger right here.
You know, Frank,

224
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:39,108
Bumpy don't own 116th no more.

225
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:41,110
Bumpy don't own
no real estate in Harlem right now.

226
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:44,030
I'm the landlord and the lease is 20%.

227
00:18:45,574 --> 00:18:48,869
Look, don't sell dope then, Frank.
Get a real job.

228
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:52,122
You need a fucking job, Frank?
Hmm? Is that what you need?

229
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:53,541
Well, you can come work for me.

230
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,669
Okay? You can drive me around, huh?
You can open my doors.

231
00:18:56,794 --> 00:19:01,717
Huh? "Yes, sir", "No, sir", "Right away, sir",
"Anything you want, Massa Johnson".

232
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,721
Twenty percent.

233
00:19:12,771 --> 00:19:15,315
Twenty percent is my profit, Tango.

234
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:19,570
If I give you that, then what do I got left?
Nothing, man.

235
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:21,072
Twenty percent puts me out of business,

236
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:23,366
and every somebody
you know out of business.

237
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:26,537
There's legitimate ways of doing things,
Tango, and then there's this way.

238
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:28,831
Not even Bumpy took 20%.

239
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:30,874
Bumpy's fucking dead.

240
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:35,588
My man.

241
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:37,382
Twenty percent?

242
00:19:46,016 --> 00:19:47,017
Twenty percent.

243
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:48,102
Doc, let's go.

244
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,334
Out: Good job: Sit:

245
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,841
A leader, like a shepherd,

246
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:18,011
he sends his fastest nimble sheep,
out front:

247
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:19,929
And the others will follow.

248
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:23,475
While the shepherd,
he walks quietly behind it.

249
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:26,729
Here, boy! Here we go. Right here.
Bring it here. Yeah.

250
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:31,902
Now he's got the stick, and the cane,
he'll use it!

251
00:20:32,652 --> 00:20:34,362
If he has to.

252
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:36,823
But most times he doesn't have to.

253
00:20:36,948 --> 00:20:40,703
He moves the whole herd quietly.

254
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:48,003
What right do they have
cutting out the supplier?

255
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:50,756
The middleman. Buying direct.

256
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:55,428
Putting Americans out of work.

257
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,389
That's the way it is now, Frank.

258
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:02,770
That's the way it is.

259
00:21:19,622 --> 00:21:23,251
The drug problem
in Vietnam is more than marijuana:

260
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:26,171
At this point, it is estimated that one third
of American troops are experimenting

261
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:28,173
with opium and heroin:

262
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:32,135
The authorities say
they have confiscated

263
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:35,765
large quantities of marijuana,
heroin and pills:

264
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,977
Every person and every vehicle
going through the gates

265
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:41,312
is subject to a thorough shakedown:

266
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:45,234
Soldiers have access to
the drugs at many rest and relaxation spots

267
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,405
in Bangkok, Saigon and other areas
throughout Vietnam and Thailand:

268
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,618
Officials say the easy availability,
relatively cheap cost

269
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:57,414
and high purity of heroin
throughout Saigon and the Far East,

270
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:01,460
is leading to an epidemic
of heroin addiction among US soldiers:

271
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:07,176
-Operator:
Yeah, international.

272
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:09,553
-What city?
-Bangkok.

273
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,472
-You know the country code?
-Yeah, 376.

274
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:17,145
-For the first three minutes, it'll be:::
-I got it, I got it. I got it.

275
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:22,943
Hello?

276
00:22:23,068 --> 00:22:24,570
Soul Brothers: Hey, can I help you?

277
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:25,863
Nate.

278
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,157
-Do I know you?
-Yeah, it's me.

279
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:30,869
-Who?
-Me, Frank. Your cousin, negro.

280
00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:36,875
Go on, get yourself a new suit.

281
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,126
Look, I'm sorry.

282
00:23:15,252 --> 00:23:16,628
Oh, please, Richie.

283
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,758
It couldn't be avoided.
I'll take him next weekend, all right?

284
00:23:20,925 --> 00:23:22,468
We're moving.

285
00:23:22,593 --> 00:23:24,554
What? Where?

286
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:28,433
The St Regis. What do you care?

287
00:23:30,936 --> 00:23:32,396
To my sister's.

288
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:34,815
-Your sister's? In Vegas?
-Yeah.

289
00:23:34,941 --> 00:23:37,402
You are not moving to Las Vegas.
Not with Michael, anyway.

290
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:41,948
What am I supposed to do with him,
leave him with you? There's a picture.

291
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:45,119
Hey, guys! Be cool.

292
00:23:47,663 --> 00:23:51,167
Laurie, Las Vegas is not
the kind of place that you raise a kid.

293
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:54,462
Like this is a good environment?
And around your friends?

294
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:56,423
When am I supposed to see my boy?

295
00:23:56,548 --> 00:23:58,675
This weekend. Last weekend.

296
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:01,721
God damn it.

297
00:24:01,846 --> 00:24:04,473
Hey! I asked you nice to shut up, right?

298
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:05,683
Now I'm gonna have to kill you.

299
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:09,062
I swear I will pull out my gun
and put a bullet in your fucking heads!

300
00:24:09,187 --> 00:24:11,148
Now stop what you're doing
and pick up the glass!

301
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:13,609
Calm down, man. Okay, be cool.

302
00:24:16,362 --> 00:24:17,822
Fucking crazy, man.

303
00:24:19,282 --> 00:24:20,992
You don't have a gun.

304
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,080
You sure?

305
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:35,008
You are crazy, Richie.

306
00:24:39,304 --> 00:24:41,432
You don't have room for us.

307
00:24:43,184 --> 00:24:45,019
I'll see you in court.

308
00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:48,315
Come on, Michael.

309
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,442
Say bye to your dad.

310
00:24:51,735 --> 00:24:53,779
-Get over here.
-Hey, kiddo.

311
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:58,660
I'll see you next week, all right?
We'll do something.

312
00:24:59,494 --> 00:25:01,538
Let's get you an ice cream.

313
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:30,612
You have 10 minutes remaining.
Ten minutes.

314
00:26:36,436 --> 00:26:39,481
Shake it, baby.
Shake it, shake it, shake it.

315
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:46,614
Oh, come on, girl. Don't tell me $5
don't get me a little something.

316
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:49,493
Can you dig that it costs money
to be here?

317
00:26:49,618 --> 00:26:51,328
Oh, come on, girl.

318
00:27:24,907 --> 00:27:26,951
How much you want, Frank?

319
00:27:27,702 --> 00:27:29,663
Tell him I want 100 keys.

320
00:27:31,832 --> 00:27:34,543
Frank, ain't nobody I know
can get you that much personally, all right?

321
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,545
You're gonna have to
piece it together from several sources,

322
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,172
and it's not gonna be 100% pure.

323
00:27:38,298 --> 00:27:40,049
I don't want that.

324
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,218
I know what you don't want, Frank,

325
00:27:42,385 --> 00:27:47,016
but look, what you're gonna need is to get
to the Chiu-Chou syndicate, all right?

326
00:27:47,224 --> 00:27:49,602
Cholon, Saigon.
If they're gonna deal with you at all.

327
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,062
I understand that,
but by then it's gonna be too late.

328
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:54,733
It'll be already chopped up.
I wanna go get it where they go get it from.

329
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,901
I wanna go to the source.

330
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:59,154
-So, you're gonna go get it yourself?
-Why not?

331
00:27:59,321 --> 00:28:01,616
Huh? I came this far.

332
00:28:02,408 --> 00:28:03,826
You're gonna go
into the motherfucking jungle?

333
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:05,286
I'm in the jungle. Look around.

334
00:28:05,411 --> 00:28:07,204
They're eating these roaches
and whatever that is.

335
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,998
Nigga, I'm talking about snakes, all right?

336
00:28:09,123 --> 00:28:10,834
I'm talking about tigers,
I'm talking about Vietcong,

337
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:14,671
I'm talking about mosquitoes
that'll fucking kill your ass.

338
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:16,965
You wanna go into the jungle?

339
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,718
We're going.

340
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,971
-Fuck it. Let's go.
-We're going.

341
00:28:22,138 --> 00:28:23,139
Why not? Let's go.

342
00:29:06,313 --> 00:29:07,940
Hey, Frank.

343
00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:11,569
This whole spot's locked down
by the Kuomintang,

344
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:15,865
General Chiang Kai-shek's defeated army.

345
00:29:54,367 --> 00:29:56,745
How would you get it into the States?

346
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,663
You ain't got to worry about that.

347
00:29:58,788 --> 00:29:59,873
Who do you work for in there?

348
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,585
You ain't got to worry about that, either.

349
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,503
Who are you, really?

350
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:07,214
Frank Lucas,
says it right there in my passport.

351
00:30:07,381 --> 00:30:09,050
I mean, who you represent?

352
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:10,176
Me.

353
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:16,141
You think you're going
to take 100 kilos of heroin into the US,

354
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:20,188
and you don't work for anyone?
Someone is going to allow that?

355
00:30:20,396 --> 00:30:21,397
That's right.

356
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:34,788
After this first purchase,
if you are not killed by Marseille importers,

357
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:40,126
or their people in the States, then what?

358
00:30:40,377 --> 00:30:43,881
Then there will be more,
much more, I guarantee it.

359
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:45,216
And if it's all the same to you,

360
00:30:45,383 --> 00:30:48,719
I don't wanna have to drag my ass up here
no more.

361
00:30:48,844 --> 00:30:50,388
Of course not.

362
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:54,393
My man.

363
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:57,145
-Soul brother, huh?
-Soul brother.

364
00:31:39,652 --> 00:31:44,365
Fifty grand. It's gonna cover them
and the pilot and the boys on the other end.

365
00:31:44,949 --> 00:31:46,743
Give them a hundred.

366
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:49,204
Fifty is gonna cover it, Frank.

367
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:52,041
Give them a hundred,
give them the whole thing. Here.

368
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,417
And look,

369
00:31:54,335 --> 00:31:58,715
that's all I got.
So, if that dope don't arrive for any reason...

370
00:32:02,093 --> 00:32:06,098
Hey, listen, cousin or no cousin,
I'm a busy man, all right?

371
00:32:06,223 --> 00:32:09,477
I ain't got no time
to be going to nobody's funeral.

372
00:32:09,936 --> 00:32:12,564
I'll let you know when it's in the air.

373
00:32:12,689 --> 00:32:13,774
My man.

374
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:29,166
Fuck.

375
00:32:37,634 --> 00:32:38,718
Richie?
-Yeah.

376
00:32:38,843 --> 00:32:40,011
This fucking guy made me:

377
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:42,514
I don't know how he did, but he did.

378
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:43,891
He went for his gun:

379
00:32:44,308 --> 00:32:45,726
I had to do it, man.

380
00:32:45,851 --> 00:32:47,728
There's 100 people
out there that heard the shots.

381
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:49,981
You gotta help me. You gotta do something.

382
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:51,817
Baby.

383
00:32:51,942 --> 00:32:52,943
Where are you, Jay?

384
00:32:54,403 --> 00:32:56,029
That's the problem.

385
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:02,745
Dispatch, I got a 10-13. I got a 10-13.

386
00:33:02,912 --> 00:33:04,872
Copy that: What's your 20?

387
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,624
Tower two.

388
00:33:08,335 --> 00:33:09,962
Apartment 1G.

389
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:12,464
Kent and West in the projects.

390
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,966
Identify yourself, please:

391
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:15,342
Detective Richie Roberts.

392
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:18,430
That's a negative: I got no units in that area:

393
00:33:18,555 --> 00:33:19,889
Bullshit.

394
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,642
Please put the call out again.
I'm gonna need assistance.

395
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:24,854
Detective Roberts,
I got no units in that area:

396
00:33:25,021 --> 00:33:26,647
-Fuck you.
-That's a negative:

397
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:39,077
I didn't mention no cops.
Know what I'm saying?

398
00:33:39,202 --> 00:33:40,288
You know what I'm saying?

399
00:33:40,455 --> 00:33:42,332
I'll get the motherfucker!
Kick his ass!

400
00:33:42,457 --> 00:33:45,209
Yo, cracker,
you gonna pay for this shit!

401
00:33:48,964 --> 00:33:52,134
Where the fuck you going?
Where the fuck you going?

402
00:33:53,886 --> 00:33:55,930
What you gonna do, motherfucker?

403
00:33:56,055 --> 00:34:00,143
Hey, hey, be cool. Be cool, all right?

404
00:34:00,268 --> 00:34:02,938
I'll find out what's going on in here.

405
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:12,783
Richie.

406
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:19,289
Open the door!

407
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:21,084
Open the motherfucking door!

408
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,418
Where's your backup?

409
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:23,878
You motherfucking cracker!

410
00:34:24,003 --> 00:34:26,464
You got no backup? Why is that?

411
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:28,801
You gotta come
out sometime, motherfucker!

412
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,136
Bandage his neck.

413
00:34:31,262 --> 00:34:32,346
Richie, he's dead.

414
00:34:32,513 --> 00:34:33,973
I know he's fucking dead, right.

415
00:34:34,098 --> 00:34:35,808
Bandage his neck, clean up his head,

416
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:38,311
prop him up on the gurney
so he's sitting and open his fucking eyes.

417
00:34:38,436 --> 00:34:39,437
Open this fucking door!

418
00:34:39,604 --> 00:34:40,855
All right? Let's go.

419
00:34:40,981 --> 00:34:42,399
Fuck.

420
00:34:45,486 --> 00:34:47,530
All right, clean him up.

421
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:50,032
Okay. Where's the solution?

422
00:34:52,368 --> 00:34:53,537
Hey.
-Huh?

423
00:34:55,205 --> 00:34:57,332
God damn it, open this fucking door!

424
00:34:58,667 --> 00:34:59,751
-Give me your gun.
-What?

425
00:34:59,876 --> 00:35:01,129
Give me your gun.

426
00:35:01,296 --> 00:35:04,048
Get your punk ass out here, man!

427
00:35:04,173 --> 00:35:06,634
-You have your badge?
-Yeah.

428
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:08,219
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch!

429
00:35:08,344 --> 00:35:09,763
-You guys ready?
-Uh-huh.

430
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:12,099
Okay. Just keep moving forward.

431
00:35:12,725 --> 00:35:14,518
-You all right?
-Yeah.

432
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:17,731
It's okay! It's okay!

433
00:35:18,189 --> 00:35:19,816
We're taking him to the hospital.

434
00:35:19,983 --> 00:35:22,819
Everybody, step back! Step back!

435
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:25,239
He's all right.

436
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:27,366
He's okay. We're taking care of him.

437
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:29,243
Step back. Step back.

438
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:33,540
Everything's fine. Just stand back.

439
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,334
He's all right.

440
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,752
He's alive.

441
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:39,004
What happened inside?

442
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:40,881
We're taking him to the hospital.

443
00:35:50,225 --> 00:35:51,560
Thanks, man.

444
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:53,896
Fuck.

445
00:35:54,438 --> 00:35:57,317
That asshole pulled a piece on me, man.
Can you fucking believe it?

446
00:35:57,442 --> 00:35:58,944
He pulls a piece on a cop?

447
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:01,738
I had to do it, man. Kill or be killed.

448
00:36:02,447 --> 00:36:04,658
Fucking crazy world, right?

449
00:36:07,536 --> 00:36:09,163
What the fuck were you
doing in the projects?

450
00:36:09,288 --> 00:36:12,792
Investigating stuff, man, you know,

451
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:16,171
just like you taught me. Checking on guys,

452
00:36:16,296 --> 00:36:19,716
following things up,
putting the pieces together.

453
00:36:19,883 --> 00:36:23,554
That guy was a dealer.
A fucking dealer. Scum of the earth.

454
00:36:24,597 --> 00:36:27,433
That guy didn't pull a gun on a cop, Jay.

455
00:36:27,558 --> 00:36:31,647
That guy pulled a gun on a junkie,
a junkie who was trying to rob him.

456
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,649
What the fuck you say?

457
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,860
What the fuck, man?
What are you doing, man?

458
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,447
-What the fuck is that?
-That's my fucking money, man!

459
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,199
I earned this shit. That's mine!

460
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,951
-I earned it doing good cop work!
-What the fuck is this?

461
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,744
-What the fuck is that?
-I earned it doing good cop work!

462
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,497
-You murdered a guy!
-I earned it getting shot at!

463
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,249
You murdered a guy!

464
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,336
You murdered him, you robbed his money,
then you called me to get you out of it.

465
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:54,339
That makes me an accessory
after the fact, motherfucker.

466
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:58,385
I'll tell you the facts, man. Just write
the report the way I say it happened,

467
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:02,598
and then that's the way it is,
and that's how it will be.

468
00:37:03,474 --> 00:37:05,101
I can't do that.

469
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:09,856
I'm a leper because I listened to you
and turned in a million bucks.

470
00:37:10,024 --> 00:37:12,651
No one will work with me after that.

471
00:37:12,776 --> 00:37:16,905
I can get off this shit, Richie. That's easy.

472
00:37:17,406 --> 00:37:22,037
Just write the report between us,
as partners.

473
00:37:23,788 --> 00:37:25,332
I can't do that.

474
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,461
Hey!

475
00:37:30,087 --> 00:37:32,131
Stop! Stop!

476
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:33,966
Fuck it.

477
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:13,719
Open the trunk.

478
00:38:28,361 --> 00:38:31,865
Peace now! Peace now! Peace now!

479
00:38:32,032 --> 00:38:35,119
LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?

480
00:38:36,036 --> 00:38:39,124
Get out, get out, get out of Vietnam!

481
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:42,127
Get out, get out, get out of Vietnam!

482
00:38:42,294 --> 00:38:45,547
:: As loud as we can
that the Vietnam War should stop,

483
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:48,843
and that the best way
to stop it is for the United States

484
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:52,013
to simply pack up
and get out of Vietnam right now:

485
00:38:57,644 --> 00:38:59,104
How we looking?

486
00:39:02,149 --> 00:39:05,737
Typically, what I see is 25% to 45% pure.

487
00:39:05,903 --> 00:39:09,490
I mean, there's no adulterants,
no alkaloids, no dilutants.

488
00:39:09,866 --> 00:39:11,368
It's 100%.

489
00:39:16,498 --> 00:39:17,583
May I?

490
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,294
Take it with you.

491
00:39:20,211 --> 00:39:21,212
Thank you, Frank.

492
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:21,806
I'll take it.
No contingencies, no loans, no nothing.

493
00:41:23,308 --> 00:41:24,392
Cash.

494
00:41:25,435 --> 00:41:26,895
Fabulous.

495
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:35,905
I'm not talking about your proclivities,
Richie. Those I only know too well.

496
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:38,116
I'm talking about being a cop.

497
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:40,702
You're talking about taking money?

498
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:42,037
I don't do that. It's not my thing.

499
00:41:42,204 --> 00:41:43,664
What about your friends
from the neighbourhood?

500
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:45,917
-Do you still hang out with them?
-Yeah.

501
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:47,335
Play baseball on the weekends.

502
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,837
Wise guys? That's gonna look good.

503
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:52,716
Guys I went to high school with. So what?

504
00:41:52,841 --> 00:41:54,802
What about Joseph Sodano?

505
00:41:56,011 --> 00:41:57,096
What about him?

506
00:41:57,304 --> 00:41:59,973
Richie, I'm just trying
to understand things your wife has said.

507
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:01,434
If they're not true, tell me.

508
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:03,103
Yeah, he's one of them.

509
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:05,689
-Is he also your son's godfather?
-Yeah.

510
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,691
He's definitely fucking her.

511
00:42:07,857 --> 00:42:12,154
Do you really care about this?
Or do you just not want her to win ever?

512
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:19,496
You know, there's an interview room
on the second floor.

513
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,790
-That's what I thought.
-The door only locks from the inside.

514
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:23,333
All rise.

515
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:33,804
Oh, God, Richie.
Richie, fuck me like a cop, not a lawyer!

516
00:42:43,231 --> 00:42:44,858
Don't answer it!

517
00:42:50,781 --> 00:42:51,866
Yeah?

518
00:43:05,923 --> 00:43:07,884
-Richie Roberts.
-Hey, Norm?

519
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,721
Hey. Richie Roberts.

520
00:43:11,846 --> 00:43:12,847
Hi. Detective Norman Reily.

521
00:43:13,014 --> 00:43:15,309
-Hey, Norm. How are you?
-Good.

522
00:43:15,476 --> 00:43:17,436
-So, is that him?
-Yeah.

523
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:29,408
Picked a nice night to come out, huh?
It's like Grand Central around here.

524
00:43:29,533 --> 00:43:31,077
It's been like this.

525
00:43:31,243 --> 00:43:35,623
I'm lucky if I get home by midnight.
It's like nothing we've seen before.

526
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:42,339
Something I gotta sign?

527
00:43:42,506 --> 00:43:44,383
Yeah. It's right here.

528
00:43:44,508 --> 00:43:46,886
I'm taking this with me.
I'll register it with Essex County, all right?

529
00:43:47,095 --> 00:43:48,471
All right.

530
00:43:50,765 --> 00:43:56,397
America's public enemy number one
in the United States is drug abuse:

531
00:43:57,815 --> 00:43:59,692
In order to fight and defeat this enemy,

532
00:43:59,858 --> 00:44:04,572
it is necessary to wage a new,
all-out offensive:

533
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:07,659
Federal authorities
have announced their intention

534
00:44:07,826 --> 00:44:10,287
to establish special narcotics bureaus

535
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:13,124
in Washington, New York,
Los Ángeles, Chicago:::

536
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,960
A detective without
the support of his fellow detectives

537
00:44:16,085 --> 00:44:17,879
really can't do much.

538
00:44:19,673 --> 00:44:21,800
You know why I don't have it.

539
00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:25,470
Doesn't matter. You did what you had to do.

540
00:44:25,595 --> 00:44:29,600
Greatest city in the world!
And it's turning into an open sewer.

541
00:44:29,726 --> 00:44:32,979
Everybody's stealing, dealing.

542
00:44:34,398 --> 00:44:37,735
Look at you.
You can't work because you did your job.

543
00:44:37,901 --> 00:44:41,238
Good news is,
you're not the only honest cop in town.

544
00:44:41,405 --> 00:44:46,119
The special narcotics bureau
in Washington is not a dog and pony show.

545
00:44:46,244 --> 00:44:49,581
They are sincere. I know this
because they want us to orchestrate it.

546
00:44:49,748 --> 00:44:52,209
And I want you to
head up things here on our end.

547
00:44:52,376 --> 00:44:54,253
If it's federal,
who do I answer to, the post office?

548
00:44:54,378 --> 00:44:55,713
No, you answer to me,

549
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:58,300
me and the US Attorney, nobody else.

550
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,428
You never step foot
in a police station again.

551
00:45:04,306 --> 00:45:06,768
You work out of your own place,
you pick your own guys,

552
00:45:06,893 --> 00:45:09,354
guys that you know
would not take a nickel off the sidewalk.

553
00:45:32,922 --> 00:45:36,258
Well, we got the lovely transit.

554
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:41,264
600-year-old mahogany doors.

555
00:45:43,934 --> 00:45:47,105
Now, look at that. Can't you just feel it?

556
00:45:47,814 --> 00:45:49,899
I think it's lovely.

557
00:45:50,024 --> 00:45:52,110
Watch your step.

558
00:45:56,323 --> 00:45:58,701
Look at these beautiful floors.

559
00:45:58,826 --> 00:46:02,831
At least, I don't know, 200 years old.
And it's hard to get the cracks...

560
00:46:02,956 --> 00:46:06,960
Now this was one of my favourite rooms but
we had some problems with the plumbing.

561
00:46:07,085 --> 00:46:09,963
I even fixed it. I know it works.
It's not gonna leak.

562
00:46:13,843 --> 00:46:16,137
Here it is.

563
00:46:22,853 --> 00:46:25,313
You know, I used to be a really good
piano player when I was a kid,

564
00:46:25,439 --> 00:46:28,234
but then, I don't know why I forgot.

565
00:46:29,027 --> 00:46:30,820
Life goes on. Well...

566
00:46:33,531 --> 00:46:36,285
How long are you gonna be?

567
00:46:38,203 --> 00:46:40,497
Oh, and do me a favour, please.
Mind the doors.

568
00:46:40,622 --> 00:46:44,294
Those are beautiful, ornate glass doors,
you know.

569
00:46:52,678 --> 00:46:53,679
Here we go, Jimmy. Come on.

570
00:46:53,846 --> 00:46:55,806
Oh, yeah. Give it back.

571
00:47:00,604 --> 00:47:01,605
Huey's.

572
00:47:01,772 --> 00:47:02,856
Huey: What up, boy?

573
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:04,107
Yeah, who this?

574
00:47:04,274 --> 00:47:05,734
Who you think it is, boy?

575
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:07,570
-Frank:
-Frank who?

576
00:47:07,945 --> 00:47:10,573
-Frank your brother, negro:
-Frank?

577
00:47:13,368 --> 00:47:14,369
That's right.

578
00:47:14,535 --> 00:47:16,538
Hey, Melvin! Melvin, where's Ma?

579
00:47:16,663 --> 00:47:19,208
-What?
-Frank's on the phone!

580
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:20,834
Hey, Ma!
-How are you doing, Frankie?

581
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:22,920
Frank's on the phone!

582
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,423
-Say what?
-Mama, Frank's on the phone!

583
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:27,258
Frank? Oh, my Lord!

584
00:47:27,384 --> 00:47:29,552
Yeah, when?
Well, you just say it, man, yeah.

585
00:47:29,677 --> 00:47:31,012
Listen, I'm gonna call y'all back

586
00:47:31,137 --> 00:47:33,391
at 6:00. I want you to get
everybody together, all right?

587
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:34,517
Get Mama, get everybody.

588
00:47:34,642 --> 00:47:36,352
-All right?
-Okay.

589
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:53,579
Hey, Frank!

590
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:54,956
What's happening, Frank?

591
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:57,626
-Hey, Frankie.
-How you doing, Uncle Frank?

592
00:47:57,751 --> 00:48:00,629
Get out the car.
Get the kids, get the kids.

593
00:48:01,547 --> 00:48:03,090
Look at this, baby.

594
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:07,137
Oh, my Lord!
I'm so glad to see you, boy.

595
00:48:07,512 --> 00:48:11,976
Oh, I'm telling you,
this is some piece of land you got here!

596
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:14,687
I wonder what
the poor people are doing here?

597
00:48:14,812 --> 00:48:16,147
And whose house is that,
Frankie?

598
00:48:16,272 --> 00:48:18,441
That is your house, Mama.

599
00:48:19,025 --> 00:48:21,194
-Mine?
-That's yours.

600
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,697
And who else?

601
00:48:25,073 --> 00:48:28,828
Now, there, that's my room
right there, man. Right over there.

602
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,713
Anybody want some more collard greens?

603
00:48:39,465 --> 00:48:43,844
I wanna tell you how happy
I am to see all my children at the table

604
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,431
and the grandchildren at the same time.

605
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,308
My heart's so happy.

606
00:48:48,433 --> 00:48:49,893
-Enjoy yourselves.
-Right on, Grandma.

607
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:52,980
I hope you got a job, boy,
the way you're eating over here.

608
00:48:53,105 --> 00:48:56,901
That boy right there, he got a arm on him.
I mean, a major league arm.

609
00:48:57,026 --> 00:48:58,027
Oh, yeah?

610
00:48:58,152 --> 00:48:59,570
Ain't that right?

611
00:48:59,695 --> 00:49:00,822
Right on, Pop.

612
00:49:00,947 --> 00:49:03,325
Well, we'll see after dinner.
We'll see him throw it around a little bit.

613
00:49:03,492 --> 00:49:05,243
No, no, you can't catch him, man.

614
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:06,703
I'm talking about... I'm talking about...

615
00:49:06,828 --> 00:49:08,539
This guy throw harder than Gibson.

616
00:49:08,664 --> 00:49:10,875
We're talking 95 miles an hour.

617
00:49:11,292 --> 00:49:13,252
-Can you catch him?
-He gonna...

618
00:49:13,378 --> 00:49:14,879
He gonna catch the ground.

619
00:49:15,004 --> 00:49:17,716
We might've played catch,
I think, when I was about five years old.

620
00:49:17,841 --> 00:49:20,636
Since then, he ain't been able to keep up.

621
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:25,642
-This is your room.
-It's perfect.

622
00:49:26,643 --> 00:49:28,561
Oh. Why, it's...

623
00:49:28,937 --> 00:49:30,939
Will you look at this?

624
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:32,107
Oh!

625
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,529
It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's just...

626
00:49:37,113 --> 00:49:38,114
I...

627
00:49:44,705 --> 00:49:46,206
How did you...

628
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:47,749
I had it made.

629
00:49:49,544 --> 00:49:50,795
From memory.

630
00:49:51,003 --> 00:49:52,547
You were five when they took it away on me.

631
00:49:52,672 --> 00:49:54,424
-That's right.
-How could you remember it?

632
00:49:54,549 --> 00:49:56,134
How could I forget, Mama?

633
00:50:00,848 --> 00:50:04,351
I'll just tell you it is perfect.

634
00:50:04,936 --> 00:50:07,147
It's all perfect.

635
00:50:12,193 --> 00:50:14,822
I can't tell you how much I love you.

636
00:50:14,947 --> 00:50:16,657
I love you, too, Mama.

637
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,576
It's okay.

638
00:50:27,377 --> 00:50:31,174
Both these guys,
good with wires, they got solid informants,

639
00:50:31,299 --> 00:50:34,177
and they're honest and they're fearless.

640
00:50:34,302 --> 00:50:36,846
They're insane, Richie, like you.

641
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:38,849
Where are they?

642
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,605
That's Jones with the skinny white broad.

643
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,357
Best I ever seen on the street.

644
00:50:46,483 --> 00:50:50,028
He knows dope, but he's together, all right?

645
00:50:50,153 --> 00:50:52,530
He's a stand-up guy all round.

646
00:50:52,655 --> 00:50:56,118
And that's Abruzzo
with the two fat black ones.

647
00:50:57,161 --> 00:50:59,705
He loves a big ass, man.

648
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:04,378
He's a bulldog. He don't fuck around,
all right. He's got a bit of a temper,

649
00:51:04,544 --> 00:51:08,131
yeah, but you can trust
this guy with your grandmother.

650
00:51:08,256 --> 00:51:12,595
Listen, Richie. We work together.
You want me, you gotta take them, too.

651
00:51:24,983 --> 00:51:25,985
When do we start?

652
00:51:29,322 --> 00:51:30,490
The man I worked for,

653
00:51:30,657 --> 00:51:32,283
he had one of the biggest companies
in New York City.

654
00:51:32,409 --> 00:51:34,745
He ran it for more than 50 years.

655
00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:39,083
Fifteen years, eight months and nine days,

656
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:40,751
I was with him every day. I worked for him,

657
00:51:40,918 --> 00:51:44,589
I protected him,
I looked after him, I learnt from him.

658
00:51:45,132 --> 00:51:47,759
Bumpy was rich,
but he wasn't white man rich, you see?

659
00:51:47,884 --> 00:51:49,344
He wasn't wealthy.

660
00:51:49,469 --> 00:51:51,806
He didn't own his own company.
He thought he did, but he didn't,

661
00:51:51,931 --> 00:51:53,516
he just managed it.

662
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:56,018
The white man owned it, so they owned him.

663
00:51:56,144 --> 00:51:57,520
-Nobody owns me, though.
-Hey.

664
00:51:57,646 --> 00:51:59,565
-How you doing, babe?
-Good.

665
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:02,317
That's 'cause I own my own company,
and my company sells a product

666
00:52:02,443 --> 00:52:05,070
that's better than the competition,

667
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:08,658
at a price that's lower than the competition.

668
00:52:09,451 --> 00:52:11,244
Well, what are we selling here, Frank?

669
00:52:26,678 --> 00:52:28,722
How you doing, Red?

670
00:52:28,847 --> 00:52:30,600
These are my brothers,
just got here from North Carolina.

671
00:52:30,725 --> 00:52:31,726
Everybody, this is Redtop.

672
00:52:31,893 --> 00:52:33,269
-Hello.
-How you doing?

673
00:52:33,394 --> 00:52:35,813
And the ladies.
Hey.

674
00:52:35,938 --> 00:52:39,109
What wrong? Y'all niggas
ain't never seen hoochie before?

675
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:40,527
Why are they all naked?

676
00:52:40,652 --> 00:52:42,362
So they can't steal nothing.

677
00:52:42,905 --> 00:52:43,906
Right.

678
00:52:44,907 --> 00:52:49,621
The most important thing in business
is honesty, integrity, hard work,

679
00:52:50,705 --> 00:52:51,956
family,

680
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:54,960
never forgetting where we came from.

681
00:52:55,211 --> 00:52:56,921
Thank you, Charlene.

682
00:53:01,842 --> 00:53:06,848
See, you are what you are in this world,
that's either one of two things.

683
00:53:08,558 --> 00:53:10,645
Either you're somebody,

684
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,856
or you're nobody. Be right back.

685
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:32,210
I need these fresh. 'Cause
if I have to come back here and get you,

686
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:33,378
-you know what it is.
Tango.

687
00:53:33,503 --> 00:53:35,005
-Don't y'all play that.
Yes, sir, I hear you.

688
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:37,049
You won't have to come back.
There won't be no problem.

689
00:53:37,174 --> 00:53:38,759
What about you, Frank?
You need anything?

690
00:53:38,884 --> 00:53:40,970
Where's my money?
Redtop gave you the package.

691
00:53:41,095 --> 00:53:42,639
You're supposed to be
handing me my money.

692
00:53:42,764 --> 00:53:44,474
Here's a jar right here. Twenty percent.

693
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:46,852
-You got the jar?
-That's right.

694
00:53:48,145 --> 00:53:49,604
Get the fuck out of here...
What you gonna do?

695
00:53:50,982 --> 00:53:53,443
What the fuck you gonna do, Frank?
Huh? What you doing?

696
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:57,905
You gonna shoot me in front of everybody?
Huh? Come on.

697
00:54:00,325 --> 00:54:01,577
Shit.

698
00:54:13,465 --> 00:54:16,260
There you go. Twenty percent.

699
00:54:40,037 --> 00:54:41,872
So, what was I saying?

700
00:54:51,174 --> 00:54:52,217
Jones.

701
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:55,721
Jonesy.

702
00:54:57,681 --> 00:54:59,141
That was nice, man.

703
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,814
-Just doing my melodious thing, baby.
-Got you.

704
00:55:10,278 --> 00:55:13,699
This is the newly formed
Essex County Narcotics Squad.

705
00:55:14,992 --> 00:55:18,579
Our mandate is to make major arrests.
No street guys.

706
00:55:19,665 --> 00:55:22,751
We're looking for
the suppliers and the distributors.

707
00:55:22,876 --> 00:55:26,004
Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines.
No grass under 1,000 pounds.

708
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:27,841
No powder under 40 kilograms.

709
00:55:27,966 --> 00:55:29,884
Any less than that,
then somebody else can waste their time.

710
00:55:30,009 --> 00:55:33,721
We gonna be handling the big shipments,
the big money and the big temptation.

711
00:55:33,847 --> 00:55:35,056
I heard a story about you.

712
00:55:35,181 --> 00:55:37,935
That you found a million dollars
in unmarked cash

713
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,813
and gave that shit back. Is that true?

714
00:55:41,522 --> 00:55:44,484
Yeah, I did.
Anybody got a problem with that?

715
00:55:48,655 --> 00:55:50,740
So do I, you know?
I think about it every day.

716
00:55:50,866 --> 00:55:53,786
I should be down in South Florida
with a 68-foot cruiser doing fishing charters.

717
00:55:53,911 --> 00:55:54,996
You and me, both.

718
00:55:55,121 --> 00:55:58,291
But you know, I didn't, so here I am,

719
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:00,836
and we'll be looking to land
other kind of sharks.

720
00:56:28,408 --> 00:56:30,160
-All right?
Bingo.

721
00:56:53,686 --> 00:56:55,814
See that, Richie?
-Yeah.

722
00:56:55,939 --> 00:56:58,859
And this stuff is your everyday stuff.

723
00:56:58,984 --> 00:57:01,821
But this Blue Magic, twice the potency.

724
00:57:01,946 --> 00:57:06,576
I mean, it's the purest thing I ever seen
in the streets. It's strong enough to smoke.

725
00:57:06,701 --> 00:57:09,704
And that's for those white suburban kids
who are scared of needles.

726
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,623
I paid 10 bucks for that.

727
00:57:11,748 --> 00:57:14,377
And it's everywhere.
I mean, it's on every corner out there.

728
00:57:14,502 --> 00:57:16,254
So, how is that possible?

729
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:20,007
Who can afford to sell
shit twice as good for half as much?

730
00:57:27,933 --> 00:57:30,270
Hey, man. Frankie, baby, good to see you!

731
00:57:30,395 --> 00:57:31,396
Everything's good?

732
00:57:31,521 --> 00:57:32,605
Yeah, man, just got back from Europe,

733
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:35,233
over there for two months,
south of France, man.

734
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:40,948
Look right, look right.
Wonderful, wonderful.

735
00:57:43,868 --> 00:57:45,328
Nicky!

736
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,039
Give us a smile, Nicky.

737
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:49,374
Show us the cover.

738
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:50,625
You know what I'm saying, man?

739
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,043
Hey, Nicky, over here.

740
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:53,588
There you go.

741
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,175
Nicky!

742
00:57:58,676 --> 00:58:01,472
Who is that? Look at you, my man.

743
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:11,232
All right.

744
00:58:11,357 --> 00:58:12,859
Ladies and gentlemen,

745
00:58:12,984 --> 00:58:15,653
the Brown Bomber! The champ!

746
00:58:15,779 --> 00:58:17,364
Mr Joe Louis!

747
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,293
Who's that with Joe?

748
00:58:28,418 --> 00:58:30,295
Miss Puerto Rico.

749
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:33,299
-Puerto Rico? Is she a beauty queen?
-Mmm-hmm.

750
00:58:33,424 --> 00:58:35,510
For real. The beauty queen.

751
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:02,581
-Welcome.
-My main man. My main man.

752
00:59:08,046 --> 00:59:09,422
Can you all excuse us for a minute, please?

753
00:59:09,548 --> 00:59:10,590
Yeah, sure, Frank.

754
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:12,384
Yes, sir.

755
00:59:13,469 --> 00:59:14,887
Thank you.

756
00:59:18,724 --> 00:59:20,101
What's going on, man?

757
00:59:20,226 --> 00:59:21,895
-What you smiling about?
-I don't know.

758
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,648
-What is this? Huh?
-What's what?

759
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:26,859
-What's what?
-Come here.

760
00:59:28,444 --> 00:59:29,737
What is that you got on?

761
00:59:29,863 --> 00:59:31,406
What's what, man?

762
00:59:31,531 --> 00:59:33,450
Yeah, that! What you got on.

763
00:59:33,575 --> 00:59:34,826
This is a very, very, very nice suit.

764
00:59:34,951 --> 00:59:36,744
That's a very, very, very nice suit, huh?

765
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,831
-That's a clown suit. That's a costume...
-Come on, man.

766
00:59:38,956 --> 00:59:41,167
...with a big sign on it that says "Arrest Me."

767
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:44,420
You understand? You're too loud.
You're making too much noise. Look at me.

768
00:59:44,545 --> 00:59:49,050
The loudest one in the room is
the weakest one in the room. I told you that.

769
00:59:49,176 --> 00:59:51,720
All right? What,
are you trying to be like Nicky Barnes, now?

770
00:59:51,845 --> 00:59:53,305
What's your problem with Nicky, man?
I like Nicky.

771
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:54,974
I ain't got no problem with Nicky.
Oh, you like Nicky?

772
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:56,392
-Yeah!
-You want to be like Nicky?

773
00:59:56,517 --> 00:59:59,145
You want to be superfly?
You wanna work for him?

774
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,063
Share a jail cell with him?
Maybe cook for him?

775
01:00:01,189 --> 01:00:02,232
He wants to talk to you.

776
01:00:02,357 --> 01:00:05,194
-Oh, so now you talking to him about me?
-What? You...

777
01:00:05,319 --> 01:00:06,779
-About what? What is it about?
-It ain't like that.

778
01:00:06,904 --> 01:00:08,238
-Then what is it like?
-We were talking,

779
01:00:08,363 --> 01:00:10,241
-your name came up.
-About what?

780
01:00:10,366 --> 01:00:13,244
I don't know, man. I told him I'd tell you.

781
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:16,581
You know... Boy, you...

782
01:00:18,417 --> 01:00:21,086
You know, if you wasn't my brother,
I'd kill you. You know that, don't you?

783
01:00:21,212 --> 01:00:22,963
I'd blow your motherfucking brains out.

784
01:00:23,088 --> 01:00:24,089
Come on, man. Don't be like that.

785
01:00:24,215 --> 01:00:25,466
I'm taking you shopping this week.

786
01:00:25,591 --> 01:00:27,427
-I went shopping.
-I can tell.

787
01:00:27,552 --> 01:00:30,222
See deep into you

788
01:00:30,806 --> 01:00:35,228
And know what you're thinking now

789
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:39,524
And if I'm what you're needing

790
01:00:40,316 --> 01:00:44,446
I need some kind of sign

791
01:00:44,947 --> 01:00:48,867
Let me know, 'cause I can't read your mind

792
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:55,333
Are you in or am I in this on my own?

793
01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:57,585
I need some clue from you

794
01:00:58,379 --> 01:01:00,047
It's a tax thing.

795
01:01:00,381 --> 01:01:02,091
It's a mistake my lawyers
are straightening out,

796
01:01:02,216 --> 01:01:05,511
-but for the time being...
-How much do you owe, Joe?

797
01:01:06,805 --> 01:01:09,432
It's nothing. It's like...

798
01:01:09,641 --> 01:01:10,767
Fifty grand.

799
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,271
You got it.

800
01:01:15,314 --> 01:01:18,151
Thank you, man.
Hey, I'm gonna pay you back as soon as I...

801
01:01:18,276 --> 01:01:21,654
Joe, this ain't no loan. It's a gift. All right?

802
01:01:21,779 --> 01:01:24,324
All you did for Bumpy, we owe you.

803
01:01:24,908 --> 01:01:26,994
Keep your chin up. All right? Okay?

804
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,122
All you have which is down there. Down.
Chin down.

805
01:01:30,665 --> 01:01:32,750
All right. Doc, will see you, okay?

806
01:01:35,253 --> 01:01:36,671
You play it so cool

807
01:01:36,796 --> 01:01:37,922
Hey!

808
01:01:39,467 --> 01:01:40,342
You still owe me that dance, right?

809
01:01:40,468 --> 01:01:42,219
Doc, come on.

810
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,642
Frank, check this.

811
01:01:56,068 --> 01:01:57,695
-How you doing?
-Hi.

812
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,864
-Frank Lucas.
-Eva Kendo.

813
01:02:00,698 --> 01:02:01,824
Nice to meet you, Eva.

814
01:02:01,949 --> 01:02:03,827
Nice to meet you, Frank.

815
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:06,872
You're Frank and this is your place?

816
01:02:06,997 --> 01:02:10,000
That's right. I'm Frank and this is my place.

817
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,631
Why is it called Small's?
Why don't you call it Frank's?

818
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:19,637
When you own something,
you can call it what you want.

819
01:02:19,762 --> 01:02:21,013
Small's.

820
01:02:21,138 --> 01:02:23,933
Or Frank's. Frankie Small's.

821
01:02:24,517 --> 01:02:26,060
Small's Frankie.

822
01:02:27,562 --> 01:02:29,022
That's right.

823
01:02:29,523 --> 01:02:31,566
You want to let my hand go?

824
01:02:33,068 --> 01:02:34,236
Okay.

825
01:02:35,655 --> 01:02:36,697
You leaving?

826
01:02:36,823 --> 01:02:38,199
No, I was going to my table.

827
01:02:38,324 --> 01:02:40,785
Okay. Need somebody to go with you?

828
01:02:42,954 --> 01:02:44,122
-Yes?
Mmm-hmm.

829
01:02:47,709 --> 01:02:48,710
All the cheesies.

830
01:02:48,836 --> 01:02:50,546
Right here, here we go.
What have we got here?

831
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:53,216
Wash your hands?
I got one print of that, don't smudge it.

832
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:54,801
Yeah.

833
01:02:57,011 --> 01:02:58,263
Hey, Spearman, what about him?
-Who is that?

834
01:02:58,429 --> 01:03:00,516
Joey Sodano. Don Cattano's nephew.

835
01:03:00,641 --> 01:03:02,143
Yeah, yeah.
Put him up there by the big man.

836
01:03:02,268 --> 01:03:03,644
He looks like your uncle, Abruzzo.

837
01:03:03,769 --> 01:03:04,854
Yeah, but he's not as handsome.

838
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:07,231
He looks more like your sister.
Where's Ice Pick's mug?

839
01:03:07,357 --> 01:03:08,358
Yeah, that's funny.

840
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:09,651
Maybe you guys
should take that show on the road.

841
01:03:09,776 --> 01:03:12,154
So we need Ice Pick Paul.

842
01:03:12,279 --> 01:03:13,613
Ice Pick Paul?
Sure. Yeah.

843
01:03:13,738 --> 01:03:15,240
There you go. Get him up.

844
01:03:15,365 --> 01:03:17,910
Ice Pick Paul,
he goes way up there, up top.

845
01:03:18,035 --> 01:03:21,414
No, Ice Pick Paul, he's a fucking soldier.
This guy's a lieutenant.

846
01:03:21,539 --> 01:03:22,707
How's that even fucking possible?

847
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:24,835
That's Benny the Bishop.

848
01:03:25,752 --> 01:03:28,922
That guy is a soldier. This guy's
a lieutenant. No way that guy's on top.

849
01:03:29,047 --> 01:03:30,799
You thinking of Benny the Bishop.

850
01:03:30,924 --> 01:03:33,803
Vinnie Two Socks is fucking
Cattano's deadbeat son-in-law.

851
01:03:33,928 --> 01:03:35,013
Jonesy's right.

852
01:03:35,138 --> 01:03:36,931
Hey, which one of you guys has ever
actually seen Ice Pick Paul selling drugs?

853
01:03:37,015 --> 01:03:38,391
Actually seen it go down?

854
01:03:41,729 --> 01:03:44,315
Yeah, seen it go down.
Been in his place. Seen him handle drugs.

855
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,317
That rat, Ricky, has told us...

856
01:03:46,442 --> 01:03:49,738
He's fucking dead. About four weeks ago.

857
01:03:50,906 --> 01:03:52,032
He's dead.

858
01:03:52,157 --> 01:03:54,409
All right, well,
we can take him off the fucking board.

859
01:03:54,534 --> 01:03:58,956
I don't think we got any
solid evidence on anybody on that board.

860
01:03:59,582 --> 01:04:02,502
What you saying, Richie?
This is weeks and weeks of work, man.

861
01:04:02,627 --> 01:04:06,089
I'm saying, take it down.
We got to start again from the street.

862
01:07:20,558 --> 01:07:22,101
Hi, who's this?

863
01:07:22,226 --> 01:07:25,438
-Hello? Gabe? Yeah, it's Scott:
-Yeah:

864
01:07:25,731 --> 01:07:28,150
Scotty! What's going down, brother?

865
01:07:28,275 --> 01:07:31,153
Those snow tyres you gave me last night:
They come in yet?

866
01:07:31,278 --> 01:07:34,991
-Oh, the snow tyres?
-Yeah: I want some more of them:

867
01:07:35,325 --> 01:07:37,577
-Give me one-and-a-half more:
-One-and-a-half,

868
01:07:37,702 --> 01:07:41,080
-that's a pretty big order.
-Yeah, I want the big whitewalls,

869
01:07:41,206 --> 01:07:43,542
they better get at least 100,000 miles:

870
01:07:43,667 --> 01:07:47,671
All right, I'll tell you what.
You come in here tomorrow morning

871
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:51,092
I'm gonna set you up real nice
with a whitewall special, all right?

872
01:07:51,218 --> 01:07:53,178
-Thanks, bro:
-No problem:

873
01:07:55,347 --> 01:07:57,390
That's considerably more than
one year's salary, Richie.

874
01:08:00,269 --> 01:08:04,190
If it disappears,
I will not be able to get it for you again.

875
01:08:05,775 --> 01:08:06,902
That's yours.

876
01:08:07,027 --> 01:08:11,323
Signing my life away again,
for a lousy twenty grand.

877
01:08:14,702 --> 01:08:18,248
-It has to be Blue Magic, right?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gonna be Blue.

878
01:08:18,373 --> 01:08:19,415
You can pick it up here tomorrow.

879
01:08:19,541 --> 01:08:20,542
$20,000.

880
01:08:20,667 --> 01:08:22,378
Just leave it there.

881
01:08:36,601 --> 01:08:38,437
-How'd you do?
-Good.

882
01:08:40,481 --> 01:08:41,899
Here he comes.

883
01:08:42,024 --> 01:08:43,442
-That's him?
-Yep.

884
01:08:44,777 --> 01:08:46,363
That was quick.

885
01:08:57,834 --> 01:08:59,460
Richie, if he goes in the city,
what do we fucking do?

886
01:08:59,586 --> 01:09:01,129
Stay with the fucking money,
that's what we do.

887
01:09:01,254 --> 01:09:02,297
We stay with the money, all right?

888
01:09:02,423 --> 01:09:03,674
We can't go in the fucking city.

889
01:09:03,799 --> 01:09:05,593
Yes, we can.
That's 20 grand in there, all right,

890
01:09:05,718 --> 01:09:07,636
that I'm responsible for. I ain't losing it.

891
01:09:07,761 --> 01:09:09,346
It's out of our jurisdiction!

892
01:09:09,471 --> 01:09:11,892
Follow the money!
All right, all right, all right!

893
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:28,160
He's pulling over.

894
01:09:28,327 --> 01:09:30,329
All right, here we go.

895
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,788
Let me out here.

896
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:35,793
Don't disappear, all right?

897
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,879
I'll circle the block.

898
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:39,380
Move!

899
01:09:57,067 --> 01:10:00,321
Hey! Who's the fuck?
You gotta fucking move!

900
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,003
Police Officer. I'm commandeering
your vehicle. Get out of the car.

901
01:10:15,755 --> 01:10:17,674
Who the fuck cares about you?
This is New York City, man.

902
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,968
-Get someone else's car!
-Get out of the car.

903
01:10:20,134 --> 01:10:22,387
Come on, man. Can't we live in peace...

904
01:12:30,281 --> 01:12:32,116
Frankie, Frankie! Sit down.

905
01:12:32,325 --> 01:12:33,618
What?

906
01:12:34,452 --> 01:12:37,080
Happy birthday, gentlemen.
How you doing, huh?

907
01:12:37,247 --> 01:12:40,751
He's about to do something, huh?
He's going bowling?

908
01:12:41,669 --> 01:12:43,129
Look at that. Strike.

909
01:12:43,296 --> 01:12:44,463
Hey, what's between your legs?
What's in the bag?

910
01:12:44,672 --> 01:12:46,257
Nothing.
-Get up, you fucker. Get the fuck up!

911
01:12:46,424 --> 01:12:47,425
Knock it off.

912
01:12:47,592 --> 01:12:48,886
Shut the fuck up! What did I tell you?

913
01:12:49,052 --> 01:12:50,095
Keep your fucking head down.

914
01:12:50,262 --> 01:12:51,263
Shut up! Whose bag is this?

915
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:52,389
What're you doing?
Sit down and shut up!

916
01:12:52,514 --> 01:12:53,682
Don't you move!

917
01:13:06,363 --> 01:13:08,782
Hey, guys? Guys! Officers!

918
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:12,203
Hey, I'm Richie Roberts, from Newark.

919
01:13:14,372 --> 01:13:15,999
That's my money.

920
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:19,461
What the fuck?
What money, huh? What money?

921
01:13:20,838 --> 01:13:22,465
The bills are sequenced, right?

922
01:13:22,632 --> 01:13:25,718
They're registered with the Essex County
Prosecutor's Office. Just check them out.

923
01:13:25,885 --> 01:13:28,805
They all start with CF3500. Have a look.

924
01:13:34,228 --> 01:13:35,437
Fucking registers.

925
01:13:35,562 --> 01:13:38,816
I thought I had a fucking Chris-Craft
sitting in my driveway.

926
01:13:38,983 --> 01:13:41,861
Honest mistake. I'll just get the money.

927
01:13:43,404 --> 01:13:45,449
-This time.
-All right.

928
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:48,369
-There it is.
All right. Thank you.

929
01:13:48,494 --> 01:13:51,789
When was the last time I was in Jersey?
Let me think.

930
01:13:53,416 --> 01:13:54,584
Never.

931
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:58,672
What're you doing,
coming over here unannounced?

932
01:13:58,838 --> 01:14:01,759
You don't think you could
get hurt doing that?

933
01:14:02,927 --> 01:14:05,555
You got your fucking money, Richie.

934
01:14:06,597 --> 01:14:10,519
And never, ever come into
this city again unannounced.

935
01:14:10,686 --> 01:14:13,021
You come in to see
a fucking Broadway show,

936
01:14:13,188 --> 01:14:16,233
you call ahead first, see if it's okay with me.

937
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:19,529
No problem. All right.

938
01:14:23,283 --> 01:14:25,536
Let's go, hit some balls.
Great suits, pal.

939
01:14:28,539 --> 01:14:30,082
Is that your car?

940
01:14:30,624 --> 01:14:32,334
That's a fucking great car.

941
01:14:33,795 --> 01:14:35,130
Have a nice fucking trip back to Jersey.

942
01:14:35,255 --> 01:14:36,381
All right.

943
01:14:36,506 --> 01:14:39,009
Come on, I got a tee time. Let's go.

944
01:14:43,055 --> 01:14:44,724
What were you doin' there?

945
01:14:44,891 --> 01:14:48,352
Well, that's where this dope is coming from.
Blue Magic, it's coming out of New York.

946
01:14:48,477 --> 01:14:50,063
What do you expect me to do, ignore it?

947
01:14:50,188 --> 01:14:53,442
The cab driver has filed aggravated assault
and grand theft charges

948
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,902
which he may reconsider

949
01:14:55,027 --> 01:14:58,531
depending on how much
the State of New Jersey offers to settle.

950
01:14:59,282 --> 01:15:02,076
I showed him my ID. I told him I was a cop.

951
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:06,832
You stole his cab
and you knock him out.

952
01:15:06,957 --> 01:15:08,959
I was chasing the twenty grand, all right?

953
01:15:09,084 --> 01:15:12,213
Next time, knock him out
before you show him your badge.

954
01:15:13,965 --> 01:15:17,719
Look, I don't want to hear
about you going into New York again.

955
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,556
-Well, then this investigation's over.
-You're not listening to me.

956
01:15:21,681 --> 01:15:23,935
I said, "I don't want to hear
about you going into New York again."

957
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:26,729
You do whatever you have to do.
You go wherever you have to go

958
01:15:26,854 --> 01:15:29,398
to figure out
who's bringing this shit into the country.

959
01:15:29,523 --> 01:15:30,524
Just don't tell me about it.

960
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:31,526
Just don't tell me about it.

961
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:38,284
There's your girl, right there.

962
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,457
-Hey, how'd you do?
-Hi.

963
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:46,627
-I didn't keep you waiting long, did I?
-No. Fine.

964
01:15:46,752 --> 01:15:49,880
Good. A woman as beautiful as you
shouldn't have to wait.

965
01:15:50,965 --> 01:15:52,758
For anything.

966
01:15:57,973 --> 01:16:00,767
Thank you, ma'am. You as pretty as ever.

967
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:07,525
-Hey, Doc.
-Tommy!

968
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:09,902
Heard your boy scored
two touchdowns last week.

969
01:16:10,027 --> 01:16:12,864
-Sure. Sure do make father proud.
-All right.

970
01:16:24,127 --> 01:16:25,878
This is your father?

971
01:16:26,755 --> 01:16:28,716
That's Martin Luther King.

972
01:16:29,592 --> 01:16:31,468
-It is not.
-It is. It is Martin Luther King.

973
01:16:31,594 --> 01:16:33,053
You know, "I have a dream"?

974
01:16:33,178 --> 01:16:34,389
Of course.

975
01:16:34,514 --> 01:16:36,308
No, that's...

976
01:16:36,433 --> 01:16:39,978
He was just as important
as Martin Luther King to me.

977
01:16:40,103 --> 01:16:41,897
What did he do?

978
01:16:42,022 --> 01:16:47,528
Did a lot of things. He was a friend
and served New York. New York served him.

979
01:16:49,155 --> 01:16:50,741
He was my boss.

980
01:16:51,033 --> 01:16:52,326
My teacher.

981
01:16:52,451 --> 01:16:53,911
What did he teach you?

982
01:16:54,036 --> 01:16:56,330
He taught me a lot of things. He

983
01:16:58,541 --> 01:17:00,752
taught me how to take my time.

984
01:17:02,128 --> 01:17:06,759
Taught me that if I was going to
do something, to do it with care, with love.

985
01:17:07,009 --> 01:17:08,594
Anything else?

986
01:17:13,015 --> 01:17:15,185
He taught me to be a gentleman.

987
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:16,394
That's what you are?

988
01:17:16,519 --> 01:17:18,647
That's what I try to be. Come here.

989
01:17:20,065 --> 01:17:22,108
Come here. Sit right here.

990
01:17:24,362 --> 01:17:25,696
Look at me.

991
01:17:26,614 --> 01:17:29,659
I own about five apartments in Manhattan.

992
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:32,287
Homes all over the East Coast,

993
01:17:32,412 --> 01:17:35,123
I could have taken you to any one of them,
but I didn't.

994
01:17:35,249 --> 01:17:36,291
I brought you here.

995
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:37,793
Frank, I was looking for you, boy.

996
01:17:37,918 --> 01:17:39,963
Because I wanted you to meet my mother.

997
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:41,631
How you doing, Ma?

998
01:17:41,756 --> 01:17:42,840
Is this her?

999
01:17:42,966 --> 01:17:44,509
-Eva, this is my mother.
Hi, Eva.

1000
01:17:44,634 --> 01:17:45,802
Oh!

1001
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:47,263
Nice to meet you.

1002
01:17:47,388 --> 01:17:48,973
-She's beautiful!
Yeah?

1003
01:17:49,098 --> 01:17:54,061
Look at her, Frank.
She's an ángel come down from heaven.

1004
01:17:54,186 --> 01:17:55,605
Thank you.

1005
01:18:03,531 --> 01:18:06,325
Mr Roberts? I'm here for our appointment.

1006
01:18:11,122 --> 01:18:12,791
-Morning.
-Morning.

1007
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:17,087
Sorry. Our appointment?

1008
01:18:17,212 --> 01:18:19,047
Child Social Services.

1009
01:18:33,522 --> 01:18:36,401
She did mention your name, though.

1010
01:18:36,526 --> 01:18:37,694
The stewardess?

1011
01:18:37,819 --> 01:18:39,654
No, not the stewardess.

1012
01:18:40,363 --> 01:18:43,951
The lady from Child Services.
She mentioned your name.

1013
01:18:44,118 --> 01:18:48,080
Right after she asked me
if I associated with any criminals.

1014
01:18:48,205 --> 01:18:49,206
All right, go! Go, go!

1015
01:18:49,332 --> 01:18:50,416
Yeah! You wanna see this?
-Go, go.

1016
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:52,085
Hey, boys.

1017
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:54,046
Joey. Hey, Joey!

1018
01:18:54,171 --> 01:18:56,006
Get in the pool. Go on.

1019
01:18:57,049 --> 01:18:58,759
Come on. Come on.

1020
01:19:03,056 --> 01:19:05,058
So, how'd she get my name?

1021
01:19:05,183 --> 01:19:06,601
-Laurie.
-Hmm.

1022
01:19:07,645 --> 01:19:09,980
She's been saying a lot lately.

1023
01:19:10,814 --> 01:19:12,024
A lot.

1024
01:19:15,862 --> 01:19:18,448
You know, when you asked me
to be your son's godfather,

1025
01:19:18,573 --> 01:19:19,741
I took it very seriously.

1026
01:19:19,866 --> 01:19:21,701
I know. I know and I appreciate that.

1027
01:19:21,826 --> 01:19:24,789
And I said yes,
I would take on this responsibility.

1028
01:19:24,914 --> 01:19:27,458
Take care of your son,
if God forbid, something happened to you.

1029
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:30,461
Joe, the kind of things
she's saying to Child Social Services

1030
01:19:30,586 --> 01:19:33,215
made me look really bad, all right.
You know,

1031
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:37,636
out at all kinds of hours at night time,
lowlife informants around, women.

1032
01:19:37,761 --> 01:19:39,596
Old friends like me.

1033
01:19:40,515 --> 01:19:42,642
Old friends like you, yeah.

1034
01:19:44,102 --> 01:19:46,312
Uncle Joey, watch me, okay?

1035
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,485
Okay, I understand.

1036
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:55,656
They ask me, I'll tell them what you want me
to tell them. I'll lie for you.

1037
01:19:55,781 --> 01:19:57,909
No, don't lie. You don't have to lie.

1038
01:19:58,034 --> 01:20:01,162
Just, omit certain details.

1039
01:20:01,913 --> 01:20:03,582
Sure. All right.

1040
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,004
You know, there's something else
I was gonna ask you.

1041
01:20:08,129 --> 01:20:11,841
-Something else.
-You don't have to answer if you don't want.

1042
01:20:13,427 --> 01:20:15,929
Blue Magic. Anything?

1043
01:20:17,723 --> 01:20:22,270
Just a lot of sorrow, misery from guys
getting put out of work, that's all.

1044
01:20:23,646 --> 01:20:24,856
What, your guys?

1045
01:20:24,981 --> 01:20:26,232
Just guys.

1046
01:20:27,734 --> 01:20:30,529
You thinking about where it's coming from?

1047
01:20:30,654 --> 01:20:33,115
Guys down south. That's all I heard.

1048
01:20:33,907 --> 01:20:35,576
-Cubans?
-I don't know.

1049
01:20:36,745 --> 01:20:38,038
Not Mexico.

1050
01:20:38,747 --> 01:20:39,873
I don't know.

1051
01:20:40,081 --> 01:20:41,124
You're telling me,
it's coming in from South America?

1052
01:20:41,207 --> 01:20:42,167
I don't know.

1053
01:20:44,962 --> 01:20:49,884
All I can tell you is whoever it is,
they're upsetting the natural order of things.

1054
01:20:50,009 --> 01:20:51,886
And that's all there is.

1055
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:08,112
What's up?

1056
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:10,074
My man, how we looking?

1057
01:22:38,715 --> 01:22:41,176
Frank, I want you to meet Mike Sobota.

1058
01:22:41,593 --> 01:22:42,927
-How are you doing, Mr Sobota?
-How are you?

1059
01:22:43,053 --> 01:22:44,054
What can I get you?

1060
01:22:44,179 --> 01:22:46,223
How about a left-hander?
From what Charlie tells me, your nephew.

1061
01:22:46,349 --> 01:22:49,560
-Oh, this is the... Yankees, yeah. Hey, Steve!
-Yankees.

1062
01:22:49,727 --> 01:22:51,145
-Steve! Come here.
-Excuse me one second.

1063
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:53,105
This boy's good, okay?
I want you to put him on the Yankees.

1064
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:54,274
'Cause you good enough, ain't you?

1065
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:56,526
I'm a Lucas.
Good enough on a bad day, Jack.

1066
01:22:56,652 --> 01:22:58,362
He's good enough on a bad day,
so don't make it a bad day,

1067
01:22:58,528 --> 01:22:59,905
make it a good day, you understand?

1068
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:04,369
NYPD, excuse me, Police Department.
Back up, baby.

1069
01:23:04,494 --> 01:23:07,497
-Whoa!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1070
01:23:07,622 --> 01:23:09,374
-Taking your ass in, Jimmy.
-Uh-uh.

1071
01:23:09,499 --> 01:23:11,669
-Taking your ass in.
-Where are the handcuffs?

1072
01:23:11,794 --> 01:23:13,754
I got a licence for that, motherfucker.

1073
01:23:13,921 --> 01:23:17,049
You got a licence for this?
Excuse me, all right?

1074
01:23:19,135 --> 01:23:21,179
Shit. All right! Yeah!

1075
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:23,098
Now, you know what?
I gotta arrest you for that shit.

1076
01:23:23,223 --> 01:23:24,391
That shit's too good to be on the street.

1077
01:23:24,516 --> 01:23:28,271
Wait a minute, I got this for you.
You ain't got to arrest nobody.

1078
01:23:28,396 --> 01:23:30,064
Are you bribing me now?

1079
01:23:30,189 --> 01:23:32,733
I'll tell you what, I'm arresting everybody!

1080
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,695
Now, all you're under arrest! You first!

1081
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:36,363
That's my family. That's my...

1082
01:23:36,488 --> 01:23:38,240
Excuse me, excuse me.

1083
01:23:40,075 --> 01:23:41,743
Back it up, baby.

1084
01:23:41,868 --> 01:23:42,912
What was that?

1085
01:23:43,037 --> 01:23:44,706
-Come on, guys.
-What's the matter with you, man?

1086
01:23:44,831 --> 01:23:46,374
-I said, what the hell was that?
-What was what?

1087
01:23:46,499 --> 01:23:48,084
-I said what the hell are you doing, man?
-Be cool, man!

1088
01:23:48,209 --> 01:23:49,377
What's your fucking problem?

1089
01:23:49,502 --> 01:23:51,213
What the hell's wrong with you?

1090
01:23:51,338 --> 01:23:53,090
Goddamn!

1091
01:23:53,924 --> 01:23:56,427
He's all right.
I just shot him in the leg, is all.

1092
01:23:56,552 --> 01:23:58,305
Damn, Jimmy!

1093
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:00,390
Get up.

1094
01:24:14,113 --> 01:24:16,783
All right, everybody, get out! Get out!

1095
01:24:17,993 --> 01:24:19,453
Come on, Frank, it was an accident.

1096
01:24:19,578 --> 01:24:20,954
It wasn't no goddamn accident.
-He feels terrible.

1097
01:24:21,079 --> 01:24:24,709
He don't feel shit, 'cause
he's coked up all the motherfucking time!

1098
01:24:24,834 --> 01:24:26,961
He's your driver. Get rid of him.

1099
01:24:27,086 --> 01:24:28,087
Come on, man, that's your cousin!

1100
01:24:28,212 --> 01:24:30,256
That ain't shit to me!
He don't mean nothing to me.

1101
01:24:30,381 --> 01:24:32,926
-What's he gonna do, go back home?
-I don't give a damn what he does!

1102
01:24:33,052 --> 01:24:35,095
Send his ass home! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1103
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:38,683
Hey! Don't rub on that! You blot that!
You understand? That's alpaca!

1104
01:24:38,808 --> 01:24:42,270
That's $25,000 alpaca! You blot that shit!

1105
01:24:42,395 --> 01:24:44,606
You don't rub it! Put the club soda on there.

1106
01:24:44,731 --> 01:24:46,651
Simple Simon-ass motherfuckers.

1107
01:24:46,776 --> 01:24:49,945
Listen, from now on, don't nobody
talk to me directly! You understand?

1108
01:24:50,071 --> 01:24:53,699
You got business with me, you talk to Huey!
Huey, you talk to me! You got it?

1109
01:24:53,824 --> 01:24:56,286
-All right.
-Damn it, never on the phone! You got it?

1110
01:24:56,411 --> 01:24:57,621
-I got it.
-All right!

1111
01:24:57,746 --> 01:25:00,123
And take them goddamn sunglasses off.

1112
01:25:00,248 --> 01:25:01,792
Take the goddamn sunglasses off!

1113
01:25:01,917 --> 01:25:03,461
Damn it, man.

1114
01:25:05,713 --> 01:25:08,049
Simple Simon-ass motherfuckers.

1115
01:25:23,566 --> 01:25:26,027
The whole place was imported.

1116
01:25:26,486 --> 01:25:28,030
Brick by brick.

1117
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,783
Gloucestershire.

1118
01:25:31,534 --> 01:25:33,536
-Who?
-Great Britain.

1119
01:25:34,287 --> 01:25:35,497
Yours.

1120
01:25:40,627 --> 01:25:42,045
Here you go.

1121
01:25:46,592 --> 01:25:47,593
Pull!

1122
01:25:53,267 --> 01:25:54,893
Come, Eva.

1123
01:25:55,769 --> 01:25:59,023
I'm sure you're dying
to see the rest of the house.

1124
01:26:02,569 --> 01:26:05,071
Of course. Excuse me.

1125
01:26:06,281 --> 01:26:09,452
Thank you for a wonderful lunch.
It was delicious.

1126
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,375
What do you think of monopolies?

1127
01:26:16,627 --> 01:26:17,753
You mean like the game?

1128
01:26:17,919 --> 01:26:21,548
No, I just think monopolies
were made illegal in the country, Frank,

1129
01:26:21,673 --> 01:26:23,885
'cause nobody wants to compete, you know.

1130
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:26,971
Nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.

1131
01:26:27,138 --> 01:26:29,724
I mean, you let the dairy farmers do that,

1132
01:26:29,849 --> 01:26:31,810
half of them would be
out of business tomorrow.

1133
01:26:31,977 --> 01:26:33,437
Just trying to make a living.

1134
01:26:33,562 --> 01:26:38,067
That's your right, I mean,
it's everyone's right. It's America.

1135
01:26:38,442 --> 01:26:42,614
We just can't do it
at the unreasonable expense of others.

1136
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:45,075
'Cause then it becomes un-American.

1137
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,160
That's why the price
we pay for that gallon of milk

1138
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:49,038
could never represent
the true cost of production

1139
01:26:49,163 --> 01:26:53,626
'cause it's got to be controlled.
It's gotta be set. It's gotta be fair.

1140
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:56,254
Gotta be controlled by who?
I set a price that I think is fair.

1141
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:57,631
-I don't think it's fair.
-You don't?

1142
01:26:57,756 --> 01:26:59,216
-I don't think it's fair.
-I think it's fair.

1143
01:26:59,341 --> 01:27:01,301
I mean, I know
your customers are happy, Frank,

1144
01:27:01,426 --> 01:27:04,138
bunch of fucking junkies that they are.

1145
01:27:04,263 --> 01:27:08,768
But we fellow dairy farmers out here, Frank,
are you thinking of us?

1146
01:27:09,477 --> 01:27:11,229
You thinking of them?

1147
01:27:11,354 --> 01:27:13,357
-The dairy farmers?
-Yeah.

1148
01:27:13,482 --> 01:27:18,237
I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about
as much as they've ever thought about me.

1149
01:27:18,362 --> 01:27:20,657
I'm just thinking out loud now.

1150
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:25,495
If you took some of your inventory, Frank,
and you sold it wholesale...

1151
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:28,541
Sit.

1152
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:32,795
We could work.
We could do some distribution.

1153
01:27:34,213 --> 01:27:35,506
I don't know. I'm pretty good, Dominic.

1154
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:39,594
You know, I got 110th, 155th, river to river.
I'm all right.

1155
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:42,639
That's kind of a mom and pop store
next to what I'm talking about.

1156
01:27:42,764 --> 01:27:44,350
I mean, let's go at least bigger than Kmart.

1157
01:27:44,475 --> 01:27:49,355
I'm talking about LA, Chicago, Detroit,
Las Vegas. Let's go nationwide, huh?

1158
01:27:49,814 --> 01:27:54,194
I'm gonna guarantee you your peace
of mind here. You don't want that?

1159
01:27:55,612 --> 01:27:57,531
You're going to need it.

1160
01:27:57,906 --> 01:27:59,533
I don't know how you view me, you know.

1161
01:27:59,658 --> 01:28:01,494
I'm kind of a Renaissance man, Frank.

1162
01:28:01,619 --> 01:28:03,580
You know,
the people I deal with on a daily basis,

1163
01:28:03,705 --> 01:28:05,540
you know, they're not enlightened, Frank.

1164
01:28:05,665 --> 01:28:08,419
You talk to them about civil rights,
they don't know, you know.

1165
01:28:08,544 --> 01:28:10,129
They're not open to change.

1166
01:28:10,254 --> 01:28:13,716
Not from the way things
are done and who's doing it.

1167
01:28:13,966 --> 01:28:17,137
I talk to them,
there's just no misunderstandings.

1168
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,683
And that's what I mean
by your peace of mind.

1169
01:28:26,356 --> 01:28:29,359
You're paying, what, $75,000, $80,000 a kilo?

1170
01:28:31,694 --> 01:28:33,822
I'm a Renaissance man, too.

1171
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:36,825
I'll consider $50,000.

1172
01:28:45,585 --> 01:28:48,798
Why would you trust these people?
And the way they look at you...

1173
01:28:48,923 --> 01:28:51,258
They look at me like
it's Christmas and I'm Santa Claus.

1174
01:28:51,384 --> 01:28:53,886
They look at us like we're the help.

1175
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,555
They work for me now.

1176
01:29:01,561 --> 01:29:01,777
I predict that
when I meet Joe Frazier,

1177
01:29:01,812 --> 01:29:03,855
I predict that
when I meet Joe Frazier,

1178
01:29:03,981 --> 01:29:08,277
this will be like a good amateur
fighting a real professional:

1179
01:29:08,403 --> 01:29:10,905
This will be like a kid out of the Olympics:::

1180
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:13,367
That's gonna be Ali in like three.

1181
01:29:13,492 --> 01:29:15,536
You're not fighting Oscar Bonavena,

1182
01:29:15,661 --> 01:29:16,954
you're not fighting Sonny Liston:

1183
01:29:17,079 --> 01:29:18,080
You're fighting Joe Frazier:

1184
01:29:18,205 --> 01:29:19,832
ALl: Everybody knows that:
That's not the point:

1185
01:29:19,957 --> 01:29:21,251
He's all talk, man.

1186
01:29:21,376 --> 01:29:23,628
Look at Frazier!
Ali gonna crush him, baby.

1187
01:29:23,753 --> 01:29:24,754
ALl: I'll stop him:

1188
01:29:24,879 --> 01:29:26,131
Stop me? You?

1189
01:29:26,256 --> 01:29:27,507
How soon? What round?

1190
01:29:27,632 --> 01:29:31,137
Don't let him obligate you:
ALl: One to 10!

1191
01:29:31,262 --> 01:29:36,100
Tonight, March 8, 1971:
Here we are at Madison Square Garden

1192
01:29:36,225 --> 01:29:37,686
for the Fight of the Century:

1193
01:29:37,811 --> 01:29:40,981
And by anybody's definition,
this is a happening:

1194
01:29:41,106 --> 01:29:45,528
There are handshakes and,
of course, there are utterly beautiful women:

1195
01:29:45,653 --> 01:29:47,780
But behind the smiles
and behind the handshakes,

1196
01:29:47,905 --> 01:29:52,535
you can feel the atmosphere is so heavy
with tension, it's almost unbearable:

1197
01:29:52,994 --> 01:29:55,289
Everybody who is anybody is here:

1198
01:29:55,414 --> 01:29:59,209
Like Sinatra: Like Graziano,
David Frost and Diahann Carroll:

1199
01:29:59,335 --> 01:30:03,131
And Woody Allen and Diane Keaton:
The celebrities are pouring in:

1200
01:30:03,256 --> 01:30:07,344
ALl: The way you all build it up,
Life magazine cover, Time magazine,

1201
01:30:07,469 --> 01:30:11,474
everybody gives their opinion:
Dempsey says I'll lose: Joe Louis:::

1202
01:30:11,599 --> 01:30:14,977
And when Joe Louis said I'm gonna lose,
that's how I knew I'd won this one:

1203
01:30:15,102 --> 01:30:18,065
Joe Louis always picks the wrong man!

1204
01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:20,275
Always picks the wrong man:

1205
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,320
Joe Louis is here tonight:
Watch your ass:

1206
01:30:23,445 --> 01:30:26,824
The official weight of Joe Frazier
is 205:5 pounds:

1207
01:30:27,659 --> 01:30:28,993
Oh.

1208
01:30:30,578 --> 01:30:33,498
ALl: Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee:

1209
01:30:33,832 --> 01:30:36,001
You're not watching the fight, Bob?

1210
01:30:36,126 --> 01:30:37,961
I'm not into boxing.

1211
01:30:38,796 --> 01:30:41,090
This ain't boxing, kid.

1212
01:30:41,215 --> 01:30:42,884
It's politics.

1213
01:30:46,262 --> 01:30:47,889
I got something for you, too.

1214
01:30:48,014 --> 01:30:49,474
Yeah?

1215
01:30:52,103 --> 01:30:53,771
The coat? For me?

1216
01:30:53,896 --> 01:30:54,980
Mmm-hmm.

1217
01:30:55,564 --> 01:30:57,233
Do you like it?

1218
01:30:57,358 --> 01:30:59,653
The coat? Yeah, yeah, it's nice.

1219
01:31:02,656 --> 01:31:04,449
-What do you think?
-Yeah.

1220
01:31:04,574 --> 01:31:06,327
-You sure?
-Yeah.

1221
01:31:13,919 --> 01:31:15,462
Over here, Sammy.

1222
01:31:15,587 --> 01:31:17,965
Hey, Sammy! Give a look.

1223
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:21,468
Joe Louis! Over here!

1224
01:31:21,593 --> 01:31:22,887
How's it going, Frank?

1225
01:31:23,013 --> 01:31:24,556
How are you, Joe?

1226
01:31:33,774 --> 01:31:38,572
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
we have quite a list of introductions:

1227
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:44,077
We are now going to introduce people
from all endeavours of life:

1228
01:31:44,619 --> 01:31:46,748
And not just show people:

1229
01:31:46,873 --> 01:31:49,876
Because everyone is here tonight!

1230
01:32:01,972 --> 01:32:03,600
Main event!

1231
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:07,604
Fifteen rounds:

1232
01:32:07,729 --> 01:32:12,777
For the undisputed
Heavyweight Championship of the World!

1233
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:13,944
There we go, Ali!

1234
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:17,615
From Louisville, Kentucky,
he's wearing red trunks:

1235
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,076
Champ! This is Frank Lucas.

1236
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:21,119
He weighs 215 pounds:

1237
01:32:22,329 --> 01:32:25,957
Here is Muhammad Ali!

1238
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:31,297
His opponent,
from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

1239
01:32:31,756 --> 01:32:34,008
he's wearing green trunks:

1240
01:32:34,425 --> 01:32:36,470
Who's that laughing with Cattano?

1241
01:32:37,179 --> 01:32:39,264
How'd he get so fucking close to the ring?

1242
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:42,476
The Heavyweight Champion of the World,

1243
01:32:42,601 --> 01:32:45,480
Joe Frazier!

1244
01:32:47,857 --> 01:32:51,195
Hey, Frank.
You gonna keep that hat on all night?

1245
01:32:51,362 --> 01:32:52,363
I'm gonna miss the fight.

1246
01:32:52,488 --> 01:32:54,198
You paid for it.

1247
01:32:57,618 --> 01:32:59,121
Joe, over here!

1248
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:41,460
This guy, he's a supplier
at most: Or just a pimp:

1249
01:33:41,585 --> 01:33:42,627
Otherwise we'd know his name:

1250
01:33:42,753 --> 01:33:46,548
His tickets were phenomenal.
Better seats than Dominic Cattano. Right?

1251
01:33:47,216 --> 01:33:49,218
Joe Louis shook his hand.

1252
01:33:50,261 --> 01:33:52,263
Who the fuck is this guy?

1253
01:33:56,101 --> 01:33:57,436
What's this?

1254
01:33:57,603 --> 01:33:59,772
That's the plate off the limo.

1255
01:33:59,938 --> 01:34:01,857
Check with the company who rented it.

1256
01:34:05,403 --> 01:34:08,448
Right there, Mr Lucas. Right there. Good.

1257
01:34:09,908 --> 01:34:12,370
Can I get a shot here, Frank? Right here.

1258
01:34:12,495 --> 01:34:13,913
Looking good, Frank.

1259
01:34:14,747 --> 01:34:15,748
Beautiful.

1260
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:19,126
Right on, Frank!

1261
01:34:19,251 --> 01:34:20,921
Congratulations!

1262
01:34:26,843 --> 01:34:28,721
She's the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

1263
01:34:28,846 --> 01:34:32,433
That's my sunshine right there, Mr Williams.
I wish Bumpy had met her.

1264
01:34:32,558 --> 01:34:33,893
Throw it to me!

1265
01:34:38,857 --> 01:34:40,359
Get a picture.

1266
01:34:50,203 --> 01:34:51,831
Come here, baby.

1267
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:18,819
-What's happening?
Sit tight.

1268
01:35:20,487 --> 01:35:22,656
Congratulations, Frank.

1269
01:35:22,823 --> 01:35:23,991
Detective.

1270
01:35:24,117 --> 01:35:27,328
So, you sure you done the right thing?
I mean, she's a beautiful girl and all...

1271
01:35:27,579 --> 01:35:29,706
Hey, hey, listen, listen.

1272
01:35:30,665 --> 01:35:32,710
Before you say anything
about me or about my wife,

1273
01:35:32,835 --> 01:35:35,337
understand this is the most important day
of my life, Detective.

1274
01:35:35,504 --> 01:35:36,964
Oh, I understand. I understand.

1275
01:35:37,089 --> 01:35:39,550
You know, a man who
walks around in a $50,000 chinchilla coat

1276
01:35:39,675 --> 01:35:41,845
and never even bought me a cup of coffee.

1277
01:35:42,012 --> 01:35:45,307
There's something wrong there.
Pay your bills, Frank?

1278
01:35:46,767 --> 01:35:47,809
I don't know what you're talking about.

1279
01:35:47,934 --> 01:35:48,936
Do you pay your bills, I asked you?

1280
01:35:49,062 --> 01:35:50,146
If you're not getting your share,

1281
01:35:50,271 --> 01:35:51,606
maybe you need
to talk to the Chief of Police.

1282
01:35:51,731 --> 01:35:55,151
What's my share?
'Cause you don't even fucking know me.

1283
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:57,154
Maybe I'm special.

1284
01:35:57,279 --> 01:35:59,073
You are special.

1285
01:35:59,198 --> 01:36:00,824
You see that right there?

1286
01:36:00,949 --> 01:36:03,202
Special Investigations Unit.

1287
01:36:04,454 --> 01:36:05,705
Special.

1288
01:36:06,581 --> 01:36:08,500
Get it?

1289
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:13,464
Ten grand. First of each month.
Deliver it right here.

1290
01:36:13,631 --> 01:36:16,133
-Are you done?
-Oh, yeah, I'm done.

1291
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:22,349
Don't forget your card.
Have a nice fucking honeymoon.

1292
01:36:22,474 --> 01:36:23,725
Let's go.

1293
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:25,002
His name is Frank Lucas:

1294
01:37:25,128 --> 01:37:27,922
Originally from Greensboro, North Carolina:

1295
01:37:28,048 --> 01:37:33,053
A couple of arrests years ago.
Gambling and unlicensed firearm.

1296
01:37:33,387 --> 01:37:37,767
For 15 years, he was Bumpy Johnson's
driver, bodyguard and collector.

1297
01:37:39,518 --> 01:37:41,396
He was with him when he died.

1298
01:37:41,521 --> 01:37:46,318
He's got five brothers.
He's the oldest. And a lot of cousins.

1299
01:37:47,444 --> 01:37:48,487
They all living up here now,

1300
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:51,449
spread throughout the five boroughs
and Jersey.

1301
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,785
The brothers are Dexter,

1302
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:56,120
-in Brooklyn: He's a dry cleaner:
-What can I do for you?

1303
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:58,874
-I'm picking up.
Yeah:

1304
01:37:58,999 --> 01:38:03,128
Melvin in Queens has got
a custom furniture and fire doors business:

1305
01:38:04,421 --> 01:38:05,548
-That's it right here?
-Right there.

1306
01:38:05,673 --> 01:38:08,885
Terrence in Newark,
he has a hardware store:

1307
01:38:09,844 --> 01:38:12,389
Turner in the Bronx has got a tyre shop:

1308
01:38:14,016 --> 01:38:16,811
And Huey Lucas in Bergen County
has a body shop:

1309
01:38:16,936 --> 01:38:18,687
-Is your manager here?
-That's my price.

1310
01:38:18,854 --> 01:38:20,398
Oh, man, I'm gonna take it
somewhere else, all right?

1311
01:38:20,523 --> 01:38:23,652
These businesses are
the distribution and collection points

1312
01:38:23,777 --> 01:38:25,737
for Frank's dope and Frank's money:

1313
01:38:26,822 --> 01:38:32,328
Everything about Frank's life seems
unpretentious, orderly and legitimate.

1314
01:38:33,079 --> 01:38:35,581
He starts early, gets up at 5:00 a: M:

1315
01:38:35,706 --> 01:38:39,503
Has breakfast in a diner
in Harlem every morning, usually by himself:

1316
01:38:39,628 --> 01:38:40,629
Then he starts work:

1317
01:38:40,754 --> 01:38:44,174
Takes a meeting with the accountant
or with his lawyer:

1318
01:38:44,299 --> 01:38:47,512
At nights, he usually stays at home:
And if he does go out,

1319
01:38:47,637 --> 01:38:51,683
it's to one of two clubs or
a handful of restaurants with his new wife:

1320
01:38:51,808 --> 01:38:53,601
-Some ball players:
-That's fucking Wilt Chamberlain.

1321
01:38:53,727 --> 01:38:58,023
Friends, musicians:
Never, never with organised crime guys:

1322
01:38:58,149 --> 01:39:00,901
Sundays, he takes his mother to church:

1323
01:39:01,444 --> 01:39:02,946
Then he drives out and he changes

1324
01:39:03,071 --> 01:39:07,075
the flowers on Bumpy's grave.
Every Sunday, no matter what.

1325
01:39:07,951 --> 01:39:10,747
Not the typical day
in the life of a dope man, Richie:

1326
01:39:10,913 --> 01:39:11,956
No:

1327
01:39:12,081 --> 01:39:15,918
Bumpy Johnson's life wasn't typical either,
and he ran Harlem for years:

1328
01:39:16,043 --> 01:39:19,548
So you're saying
that Frank Lucas replaced Bumpy Johnson?

1329
01:39:19,673 --> 01:39:21,091
Yeah:
His driver?

1330
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:23,761
Yeah:
Sounds a little farfetched:

1331
01:39:23,886 --> 01:39:26,431
But is it? Is it?
Because everything he does:::

1332
01:39:26,556 --> 01:39:27,724
He's handing out turkeys, man.

1333
01:39:27,849 --> 01:39:30,185
:: He does the same as
Bumpy would have done, right?

1334
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:33,396
And who was Bumpy most likely to teach?

1335
01:39:33,521 --> 01:39:35,566
The guy he sees every day.

1336
01:39:35,691 --> 01:39:37,943
It's like a Sicilian family:

1337
01:39:38,110 --> 01:39:42,156
He's structured his organisation
to protect him in the same way.

1338
01:39:42,282 --> 01:39:43,658
And if he was with Bumpy for so long,

1339
01:39:43,784 --> 01:39:46,369
that means he would have
spent a lot of time with Italians.

1340
01:39:46,495 --> 01:39:49,247
Definitely long enough to learn that much.

1341
01:39:49,414 --> 01:39:53,628
But here's the thing. I don't think
it's Frank Lucas that we're after.

1342
01:39:53,753 --> 01:39:56,714
Who we want is whoever Frank Lucas
is working for.

1343
01:39:56,839 --> 01:39:58,842
It's whoever's actually
bringing the heroin in.

1344
01:39:58,967 --> 01:40:05,557
Okay. So what do you have on him
that will stick in court? Because this isn't it.

1345
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:10,855
Without powder, without informants,
no one's going to jail.

1346
01:40:11,356 --> 01:40:12,524
That's understood, sir.

1347
01:40:12,649 --> 01:40:13,900
And I don't think we're gonna
get informants, not from inside the family,

1348
01:40:15,361 --> 01:40:17,613
And I don't think we're gonna
get informants, not from inside the family,

1349
01:40:17,738 --> 01:40:19,615
you know, unless we get very, very lucky.

1350
01:40:22,535 --> 01:40:27,332
Straight up lab tests suggesting
purity's consistent with Asian dope.

1351
01:40:28,375 --> 01:40:31,421
The Italians, we know,
usually work with other Europeans

1352
01:40:31,546 --> 01:40:33,464
or with the Turks.

1353
01:40:34,298 --> 01:40:39,555
We got small blue packets turning up in
neighbourhoods all over the Tri-State area.

1354
01:40:40,013 --> 01:40:42,391
From Chinatown, to Harlem,
Washington Heights

1355
01:40:42,516 --> 01:40:44,643
Richmond Avenue and Staten Island.

1356
01:40:44,768 --> 01:40:47,564
They got North Orange, Princeton, Bayonne,
Newark,

1357
01:40:48,606 --> 01:40:52,193
Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo,
and all the way through Connecticut.

1358
01:40:52,318 --> 01:40:54,237
The same dope.

1359
01:41:02,329 --> 01:41:04,124
That's it, down there.

1360
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,397
And it's Three Counts
as they round the turn for home now:

1361
01:41:48,882 --> 01:41:51,051
Okay, let's all join hands.

1362
01:41:55,431 --> 01:41:58,101
Lord, we thank You for this
food we're about to receive,

1363
01:41:58,267 --> 01:42:00,145
the nourishments of our bodies.

1364
01:42:00,312 --> 01:42:04,691
Feed our souls with heavenly grace,
in Jesus' name and for His sake.

1365
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:06,860
-Amen.
Amen.

1366
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:27,217
Shh. Shh.

1367
01:42:27,342 --> 01:42:30,429
Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Come on, now.

1368
01:42:31,931 --> 01:42:33,015
It's okay.

1369
01:42:34,308 --> 01:42:38,104
-You better get yourself ready, old man.
-Come on, big man. Throw the ball.

1370
01:42:38,271 --> 01:42:40,816
Get yourself ready, old man. All right!

1371
01:42:40,983 --> 01:42:43,735
Come on, now. Your pop said
you had an arm on you. Come on!

1372
01:42:43,861 --> 01:42:46,363
I'm gonna set your ass
in the grass, Uncle Melvin.

1373
01:42:46,530 --> 01:42:49,033
Hey! Watch your mouth, boy.
Throw the ball!

1374
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:51,953
Damn, Uncle Melvin,
I'm a pitcher, not an outfielder!

1375
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:54,122
Steve. Steve, come here.

1376
01:42:55,457 --> 01:42:56,417
Come, sit down.

1377
01:42:56,584 --> 01:42:58,878
Uncle Frank. What's happening?

1378
01:42:59,712 --> 01:43:01,005
How you doing?

1379
01:43:01,172 --> 01:43:02,131
Cool.

1380
01:43:02,298 --> 01:43:03,549
You want a drink?

1381
01:43:03,716 --> 01:43:05,260
You know better than that.

1382
01:43:05,385 --> 01:43:06,845
Just checking.

1383
01:43:09,181 --> 01:43:12,351
Why didn't you show up
for that meeting, Steve?

1384
01:43:13,186 --> 01:43:16,272
I set it up with the Yankees and Billy Martin.

1385
01:43:18,191 --> 01:43:20,152
Why didn't you show up?

1386
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:24,198
Don't lie to me.

1387
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:27,242
I don't want to play ball no more.

1388
01:43:27,868 --> 01:43:28,912
-I decided.
-What you talking about?

1389
01:43:29,079 --> 01:43:31,039
You decided? Decided what?

1390
01:43:31,206 --> 01:43:32,999
-That ain't what I want.
-What you talking about?

1391
01:43:33,166 --> 01:43:34,459
You've been playing
since you was a little boy.

1392
01:43:34,626 --> 01:43:36,337
You were ready to go into the pros.
What you...

1393
01:43:36,504 --> 01:43:38,714
Frank! We got a problem, man.

1394
01:43:42,051 --> 01:43:43,677
What do you want?

1395
01:43:45,263 --> 01:43:47,682
I want what you got, Uncle Frank.

1396
01:43:47,849 --> 01:43:49,476
I want to be you.

1397
01:44:09,207 --> 01:44:12,627
He's been diluting it so much.
We're down 2%, 3% pure.

1398
01:44:12,752 --> 01:44:15,213
And you tested it? You're sure?

1399
01:44:15,338 --> 01:44:16,423
Yeah.

1400
01:44:21,429 --> 01:44:22,596
Fuck you looking at?

1401
01:45:15,031 --> 01:45:16,616
My man.

1402
01:45:18,409 --> 01:45:20,036
-Welcome, Frank.
-How you doing, Nick?

1403
01:45:21,371 --> 01:45:23,248
It's all great. Welcome.

1404
01:45:23,373 --> 01:45:25,334
-I need to talk to you.
-Great. Come on.

1405
01:45:25,459 --> 01:45:30,131
Hey, you all, everybody get out! Let's go.
Come on! Hurry up!

1406
01:45:31,674 --> 01:45:34,094
Sit, my brother.

1407
01:45:35,512 --> 01:45:37,765
I take it you talked to Charlie.

1408
01:45:38,933 --> 01:45:41,310
Guess you wanna hear more
about my Black coalition.

1409
01:45:41,435 --> 01:45:42,937
-Let me explain to you...
-No, no, no.

1410
01:45:43,062 --> 01:45:46,024
I'm all right.
That's not what I came here for, Nick.

1411
01:45:47,359 --> 01:45:48,860
Yeah, everybody's good, Nick.

1412
01:45:48,985 --> 01:45:51,947
You know, everybody's happy.
Charlie, Baz, the Italians,

1413
01:45:52,072 --> 01:45:54,158
you know, Johnny Law.
Everybody's happy except you.

1414
01:45:54,283 --> 01:45:56,828
-I'm happy, Frank.
-You happy? Really?

1415
01:45:56,953 --> 01:46:00,331
Well, maybe I'm the one with the problem.
Yeah, go on. Get one.

1416
01:46:00,456 --> 01:46:01,542
All right.

1417
01:46:01,917 --> 01:46:02,918
I gotta problem 'cause

1418
01:46:03,043 --> 01:46:07,381
I don't understand why you gotta take
something that's perfectly good

1419
01:46:07,506 --> 01:46:09,174
and mess it up.

1420
01:46:09,424 --> 01:46:11,928
See, brand names.
Brand names mean something. Understand?

1421
01:46:13,263 --> 01:46:14,597
Shut the fuck up!

1422
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:18,811
Go ahead, Frank.
I'm sorry about that bullshit.

1423
01:46:18,936 --> 01:46:20,271
Blue Magic.

1424
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:24,483
That's a brand name.
Like Pepsi, that's a brand name.

1425
01:46:24,608 --> 01:46:27,320
I stand behind it. I guarantee it.

1426
01:46:27,446 --> 01:46:29,573
They know that, even if they don't know me
any more than

1427
01:46:29,698 --> 01:46:32,242
they know the chairman of General Mills.

1428
01:46:32,367 --> 01:46:33,660
What the fuck are you talking about, Frank?

1429
01:46:33,785 --> 01:46:36,622
What I'm talking about is
when you chop my dope down

1430
01:46:36,747 --> 01:46:41,377
to one, two, three, four, five percent
and then you call it Blue Magic,

1431
01:46:41,502 --> 01:46:44,631
that is trademark infringement.
You understand what I'm saying?

1432
01:46:44,756 --> 01:46:47,217
With all due respect, Frank,
if I buy something, I own it.

1433
01:46:47,342 --> 01:46:48,594
No, that ain't true. That ain't true.

1434
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:50,889
If I buy a car, and I wanna paint it,
I can paint the motherfucker.

1435
01:46:51,055 --> 01:46:52,182
Yeah, but you don't have to.

1436
01:46:52,307 --> 01:46:55,310
This is what I'm saying to you, Nick, you
don't have to. Good enough the way it is.

1437
01:46:55,435 --> 01:46:58,189
You can make enough money off it
the way it is, just by calling it Blue Magic.

1438
01:46:58,314 --> 01:47:00,107
Anything more than that is greed, son.

1439
01:47:00,232 --> 01:47:02,109
What you want, Frank?
You want me to change the name on it?

1440
01:47:02,234 --> 01:47:04,278
I would have to insist
that you change the name.

1441
01:47:04,403 --> 01:47:08,200
Fine by me, Frank. I'll call it Red Magic,
even though that don't sound as good.

1442
01:47:08,325 --> 01:47:11,203
I don't give a fuck what you call it.
Put a chokehold on the motherfucker

1443
01:47:11,328 --> 01:47:13,914
and call it Blue Dog Shit,
you know what I mean?

1444
01:47:14,039 --> 01:47:18,252
I don't care, just don't let me catch you
doing this again.

1445
01:47:18,377 --> 01:47:21,047
Catch me? Infringement? Insist?

1446
01:47:21,172 --> 01:47:22,925
I don't like these words as much as,

1447
01:47:23,050 --> 01:47:25,761
"Please, thank you,
I'm sorry to bother you, Nicky."

1448
01:47:25,886 --> 01:47:27,971
These are better words you use to come
to my motherfucking club

1449
01:47:28,096 --> 01:47:30,642
without an invitation! You hear me?

1450
01:47:31,684 --> 01:47:32,894
My man.

1451
01:47:41,529 --> 01:47:43,656
Oh, shit. Fuck, is that the cops there, man?

1452
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:55,378
It's all right.

1453
01:47:56,462 --> 01:47:59,382
The hell they're gonna do, give us a ticket?

1454
01:47:59,507 --> 01:48:01,717
Stuff's in the car, Frank.

1455
01:48:03,637 --> 01:48:04,638
What?

1456
01:48:04,763 --> 01:48:06,890
Some of it's in the trunk.

1457
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:10,394
-How you doing, Frank?
-I'm good. How you doing, Detective?

1458
01:48:10,519 --> 01:48:11,938
How was your Thanksgiving?

1459
01:48:12,063 --> 01:48:14,399
Not so good, as a matter of fact.
Why don't you get out of the car?

1460
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:21,073
Come on, give me the fucking keys.

1461
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:23,409
-Where's the Shelby at?
-The Shelby's gone, Frank.

1462
01:48:23,534 --> 01:48:24,910
-The Shelby's gone?
-Stay right there.

1463
01:48:25,035 --> 01:48:26,913
Yes, sir. Right here.

1464
01:48:27,998 --> 01:48:29,583
You got anything
worth looking at in here?

1465
01:48:29,708 --> 01:48:31,418
Hey, that's that Trupo guy.

1466
01:48:31,543 --> 01:48:33,086
Is that him?
Yeah.

1467
01:48:33,211 --> 01:48:34,713
Fucking prick.

1468
01:48:37,967 --> 01:48:40,344
-Come over here a minute, Frank.
-Yeah.

1469
01:48:42,638 --> 01:48:43,682
What are we gonna do about this?

1470
01:48:43,807 --> 01:48:46,226
We don't do shit about it.
We close it up, throw it back in the trunk,

1471
01:48:46,351 --> 01:48:48,937
everybody go home,
have some pumpkin pie, warm apple cider.

1472
01:48:49,062 --> 01:48:50,814
I got a better idea.

1473
01:48:51,983 --> 01:48:55,320
Or would you rather me throw you
and your brother in the fucking river?

1474
01:48:55,487 --> 01:48:58,490
Would you rather your house
blows up next time?

1475
01:49:02,703 --> 01:49:04,955
-I loved that car.
-I know.

1476
01:49:08,335 --> 01:49:11,379
What's he doing? Shakedown!

1477
01:49:12,088 --> 01:49:14,257
Somebody's getting some money
for the Benevolent Fund.

1478
01:49:14,382 --> 01:49:15,384
Look at that shit.

1479
01:49:16,052 --> 01:49:17,345
Sorry, Frank.

1480
01:49:17,512 --> 01:49:19,722
It's all right. Go and get in the car.

1481
01:49:43,124 --> 01:49:45,543
All right, you call me back.

1482
01:49:46,877 --> 01:49:50,715
INS, IRS, FBI.
I can't get a damn thing out of any of them.

1483
01:49:50,882 --> 01:49:54,261
Because they all think you're on the take.
And you think they are.

1484
01:49:58,015 --> 01:49:59,308
You know,
I don't think they want this to stop.

1485
01:49:59,475 --> 01:50:01,644
I think it employs too many people.

1486
01:50:01,811 --> 01:50:07,860
Judges, lawyers, cops, politicians,
prison guards, probation officers.

1487
01:50:08,485 --> 01:50:09,570
They stop bringing dope into this country,

1488
01:50:09,736 --> 01:50:12,407
about 100,000 people
are going to be out of a job.

1489
01:50:15,743 --> 01:50:18,663
Spearman.

1490
01:50:18,830 --> 01:50:22,168
FBI. Here to see Detective Roberts.

1491
01:50:26,839 --> 01:50:30,469
So who took it out? Somebody I know?
My wife?

1492
01:50:31,887 --> 01:50:35,223
Come on, if somebody's taking a contract
out on my life, I'd like to know.

1493
01:50:35,390 --> 01:50:38,936
I can't say without compromising
our source. You understand?

1494
01:50:39,103 --> 01:50:41,439
No. Not when it's my life,
I don't understand.

1495
01:50:41,606 --> 01:50:44,776
-If you want we can assign someone to you.
-FBI protection.

1496
01:50:45,736 --> 01:50:49,114
You know what? My life
is dangerous enough as it is.

1497
01:50:50,449 --> 01:50:52,243
Well, we'll let you get back
to your business.

1498
01:50:52,410 --> 01:50:56,831
Okay. Larry, Bob.
Thanks for visiting The Garden State.

1499
01:50:56,998 --> 01:50:57,999
Take care.

1500
01:50:58,166 --> 01:51:00,461
Hey, what do you know
about Frank Lucas?

1501
01:51:00,628 --> 01:51:03,964
We know that you keep calling about him.

1502
01:51:13,725 --> 01:51:18,189
We believe that peace is at hand:

1503
01:51:20,274 --> 01:51:24,696
We believe that an agreement
is within sight:

1504
01:51:27,533 --> 01:51:30,619
As I said earlier:::

1505
01:51:35,166 --> 01:51:36,167
Yeah.

1506
01:51:37,377 --> 01:51:39,295
Hey, Joey. Hi.

1507
01:51:41,257 --> 01:51:44,093
All right. Yeah, tomorrow. Why?

1508
01:52:04,073 --> 01:52:05,117
What the fuck is a microwave?

1509
01:52:05,284 --> 01:52:08,245
It's a scientific force,
like atomic energy.

1510
01:52:08,412 --> 01:52:10,164
-Yeah?
Yeah.

1511
01:52:10,330 --> 01:52:12,374
It rearranges the molecules.

1512
01:52:12,541 --> 01:52:14,586
Of what?
Of what? Of popcorn.

1513
01:52:17,797 --> 01:52:20,550
Of your head. Stick it in. Go on.

1514
01:52:23,929 --> 01:52:25,890
I can get you one of those.

1515
01:52:26,056 --> 01:52:29,311
Brand new, just like this.
I'll have it delivered.

1516
01:52:29,769 --> 01:52:31,313
No, thank you.

1517
01:52:40,990 --> 01:52:42,992
Hey. Where is that?

1518
01:52:43,159 --> 01:52:47,456
Aspen. We just got back.
Had a great time. You know who we met?

1519
01:52:47,623 --> 01:52:49,291
Who?

1520
01:52:49,458 --> 01:52:51,168
Burt Reynolds.

1521
01:52:51,335 --> 01:52:55,006
-Yeah? Yeah?
-Yeah. I'm not kidding.

1522
01:52:55,173 --> 01:52:59,052
A lot people from Hollywood go up
there now. They're buying up everything.

1523
01:52:59,219 --> 01:53:00,803
-This is your place?
-Mmm.

1524
01:53:00,970 --> 01:53:04,767
You know what that's worth?
Ski in, ski out. Five bedrooms.

1525
01:53:04,934 --> 01:53:08,020
Sauna. Everything. We were guests.

1526
01:53:12,776 --> 01:53:14,402
It's your place.

1527
01:53:29,545 --> 01:53:32,005
Isn't there something we can do,

1528
01:53:33,925 --> 01:53:36,761
about leaving the big guy alone?

1529
01:53:36,886 --> 01:53:38,721
You know who I mean.

1530
01:53:38,888 --> 01:53:42,393
I don't report what you just said,
I can get in a lot of trouble.

1531
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,312
I do report it, then the trouble is yours.

1532
01:53:47,565 --> 01:53:49,818
I'm hoping you won't do that.

1533
01:53:50,694 --> 01:53:53,196
Richie, come on. I'm not taping it.

1534
01:53:53,363 --> 01:53:56,449
How do you know? Because we're friends.

1535
01:53:56,575 --> 01:53:58,911
And I'm telling you, this is a real offer.

1536
01:53:59,078 --> 01:54:00,913
From who? Your uncle?

1537
01:54:04,667 --> 01:54:07,129
Why would you do this?
Why would you risk our friendship?

1538
01:54:07,296 --> 01:54:08,589
Because

1539
01:54:10,924 --> 01:54:13,177
I care what happens to you.

1540
01:54:15,305 --> 01:54:17,098
You shouldn't have done this.

1541
01:54:17,265 --> 01:54:20,393
I had to, I had no choice.
Neither do you. Richie!

1542
01:54:21,186 --> 01:54:24,940
You don't have a choice.
Just leave Frank Lucas alone.

1543
01:54:26,692 --> 01:54:28,152
Frank Lucas?

1544
01:54:29,361 --> 01:54:30,447
Yeah.

1545
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:36,036
You tell Marie I had to leave. I'm sorry.

1546
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:38,331
Tell her why.

1547
01:55:21,254 --> 01:55:22,713
-Talk! Talk!
-Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1548
01:55:22,839 --> 01:55:25,091
-Are you Richie Roberts?
-Yes, so what?

1549
01:55:25,925 --> 01:55:28,053
You've been served. I'm sorry.

1550
01:55:42,443 --> 01:55:43,404
All right.

1551
01:55:47,616 --> 01:55:48,701
Laurie.

1552
01:55:50,787 --> 01:55:54,457
Look, I'm sorry I never gave you
the kind of life you wanted, all right.

1553
01:55:54,624 --> 01:55:56,877
I'm sorry it was never enough.

1554
01:56:00,047 --> 01:56:02,633
Don't punish me for being honest.

1555
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,719
Don't take my boy away.

1556
01:56:07,139 --> 01:56:10,434
What are you saying?
That because you were honest

1557
01:56:10,642 --> 01:56:13,729
and you didn't take money
like every other cop, I left you?

1558
01:56:13,896 --> 01:56:16,399
No, you don't take money for one reason.

1559
01:56:16,566 --> 01:56:19,694
To buy being dishonest
about everything else.

1560
01:56:19,861 --> 01:56:21,779
And that's worse than taking money
nobody gives a shit about.

1561
01:56:21,988 --> 01:56:25,201
Drug money, gambling money
nobody's gonna miss.

1562
01:56:25,367 --> 01:56:28,746
You know, I'd rather you took it
and been honest with me.

1563
01:56:28,913 --> 01:56:31,583
Or don't take it. I don't care.
But then don't go cheat on me.

1564
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:33,585
Don't cheat on your kid
by never being around.

1565
01:56:33,752 --> 01:56:37,964
Don't go out and get laid by your snitches
and your secretaries and strippers!

1566
01:56:38,089 --> 01:56:40,843
I can tell by just looking, she's one of them.

1567
01:56:40,968 --> 01:56:42,011
You...

1568
01:56:42,178 --> 01:56:46,724
You think you're going to heaven
because you're honest, but you're not.

1569
01:56:46,891 --> 01:56:49,394
You're going to the same hell
as the crooked cops you can't stand.

1570
01:56:50,729 --> 01:56:52,272
All rise.

1571
01:56:56,694 --> 01:56:58,863
Please be seated.

1572
01:56:59,864 --> 01:57:04,161
Miss Dickerson,
before the court renders its opinion,

1573
01:57:04,370 --> 01:57:06,956
is there anything else
you'd like to be heard on?

1574
01:57:07,122 --> 01:57:08,832
Yes, Your Honour.

1575
01:57:08,958 --> 01:57:12,045
Your Honour, a lot has been said here today
about how unsavoury

1576
01:57:12,212 --> 01:57:16,132
Mr Roberts' environment is for a child.
How dangerous it is.

1577
01:57:16,299 --> 01:57:20,012
We tell him to protect us.
We give him that responsibility,

1578
01:57:20,221 --> 01:57:22,682
but then say, "Oh, we don't trust you
to raise a child.

1579
01:57:22,890 --> 01:57:24,350
"We don't think you're fit for that."

1580
01:57:24,517 --> 01:57:26,060
I'm not.

1581
01:57:26,894 --> 01:57:28,355
You're right.

1582
01:57:29,565 --> 01:57:31,984
Being around me is no place for a kid.

1583
01:57:32,150 --> 01:57:35,320
You take him to Vegas.
I'll come see him when I can.

1584
01:57:38,283 --> 01:57:41,995
Your Honour, I want to apologise
for wasting the court's time.

1585
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:55,468
Doc.

1586
01:57:55,635 --> 01:57:57,012
I see them.

1587
01:57:57,137 --> 01:57:58,597
There he is.

1588
01:58:17,118 --> 01:58:18,745
The fuck is this guy doing?

1589
01:58:19,537 --> 01:58:20,830
Hey!
-Champagne.

1590
01:58:20,997 --> 01:58:23,124
Merry Christmas, Detectives.
-For us?

1591
01:58:23,291 --> 01:58:25,085
Yeah. Enjoy that.

1592
01:58:25,461 --> 01:58:27,755
-You fellas have a good time.
-Mmm-hmm.

1593
01:58:28,964 --> 01:58:30,507
It's Cristal.

1594
01:58:34,638 --> 01:58:36,890
South Vietnamese troops
called in air strikes

1595
01:58:37,057 --> 01:58:39,893
on Communist positions inside the city:

1596
01:58:41,479 --> 01:58:44,148
Paying off Johnny Law, that's one thing.

1597
01:58:44,273 --> 01:58:45,233
There ain't no problem with that.

1598
01:58:45,399 --> 01:58:48,403
I've been paying off the police
since I was 10 years old.

1599
01:58:48,570 --> 01:58:51,323
Put more of their kids through college
than the National Merit Award.

1600
01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:53,200
Give me one of them round one... Yeah.

1601
01:58:53,325 --> 01:58:55,202
This is different, though. These...

1602
01:58:55,369 --> 01:58:59,207
Special Investigative Unit. That's
their problem. They think they're special.

1603
01:58:59,415 --> 01:59:01,960
Fucking crooks. No code of ethics.

1604
01:59:02,126 --> 01:59:03,086
What do you think?

1605
01:59:03,253 --> 01:59:05,673
Looks great. It's beautiful.

1606
01:59:05,839 --> 01:59:06,924
Good.

1607
01:59:07,550 --> 01:59:09,552
The police, that ain't the only somebody
I'm worried about.

1608
01:59:09,718 --> 01:59:12,639
I seeing cars where I ain't never seen them
before, people I don't know.

1609
01:59:12,806 --> 01:59:14,057
Yeah, me, too.

1610
01:59:14,224 --> 01:59:15,684
Ho, ho, ho.

1611
01:59:15,850 --> 01:59:16,935
-Merry Christmas, Charlie.
-Thank you.

1612
01:59:19,896 --> 01:59:22,275
-Merry Christmas, Charlie.
-Thank you.

1613
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:24,068
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

1614
01:59:24,193 --> 01:59:26,028
Here, take this.

1615
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:28,030
A quick toast, and then I'll be off.

1616
01:59:28,949 --> 01:59:33,161
What happened here was an
accident of war: Somebody made a mistake:

1617
01:59:34,162 --> 01:59:38,793
Bumpy ain't hardly ever go out no more.
After a certain point he stayed in the house.

1618
01:59:41,546 --> 01:59:43,756
Watch TV.

1619
01:59:45,009 --> 01:59:47,011
Play chess. Read the newspaper.

1620
01:59:48,679 --> 01:59:52,934
I thought he was just trying to lead the
quiet life, but no, he couldn't go nowhere.

1621
01:59:53,059 --> 01:59:56,187
-Not without something happening.
-Frankie...

1622
01:59:56,354 --> 01:59:59,733
-We can still go out.
-With who? Where?

1623
01:59:59,858 --> 02:00:03,279
-Well, with...
-But I know he's under surveillance.

1624
02:00:04,405 --> 02:00:07,992
Ain't gonna be no Christmas time
with my family being here no more.

1625
02:00:08,117 --> 02:00:11,246
Why don't you just pay
who you have to pay?

1626
02:00:11,371 --> 02:00:15,709
I do pay them. I pay thousands and millions
to dope dealers, crooks, cops.

1627
02:00:16,168 --> 02:00:18,504
I pay everybody.
I pay more than they should get.

1628
02:00:18,630 --> 02:00:20,757
I can't satisfy nobody!

1629
02:00:20,882 --> 02:00:25,054
It's like dope! Everybody's strung out!
The more you give 'em, the more they want.

1630
02:00:25,179 --> 02:00:27,473
They expect more.

1631
02:00:28,557 --> 02:00:30,726
Give more and they want more.

1632
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:37,484
Do you want to go out?

1633
02:00:38,485 --> 02:00:40,445
All right, baby.
Put something of what you got.

1634
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:41,739
-Should I?
-Yeah.

1635
02:00:41,864 --> 02:00:43,032
That's Christmas spirit.

1636
02:00:43,157 --> 02:00:45,409
That's what I'm talking about. Feliz Navidad:

1637
02:00:45,535 --> 02:00:46,994
-Something nice?
-Mmm-hmm.

1638
02:00:54,753 --> 02:00:56,296
We're going to have a great time.

1639
02:00:56,421 --> 02:00:57,465
That's right, chica:

1640
02:00:57,590 --> 02:01:00,093
Mr Lucas. Enjoy your evening.

1641
02:01:00,218 --> 02:01:01,302
It's all clear.

1642
02:01:06,725 --> 02:01:07,810
Nicky!

1643
02:01:07,977 --> 02:01:09,687
Who is that?
There's your boy, Nicky. See him?

1644
02:01:09,853 --> 02:01:10,854
Know what I'm saying?

1645
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:13,525
Yeah, I see him. Let's keep going.

1646
02:01:14,276 --> 02:01:15,360
Around back?

1647
02:01:15,485 --> 02:01:18,488
Hell, no.
I ain't sneaking into my own club.

1648
02:01:18,947 --> 02:01:20,824
-Incredible.
-Huh?

1649
02:01:43,141 --> 02:01:44,309
Come on.

1650
02:01:47,438 --> 02:01:48,439
Hold on. Hold on.

1651
02:01:56,907 --> 02:01:57,908
What?

1652
02:01:58,074 --> 02:01:59,868
I want to wait in the car.

1653
02:01:59,993 --> 02:02:02,997
Frank, I got it. I got it. I'll wait for it. I got it.

1654
02:02:03,456 --> 02:02:05,416
-Get that yellow sauce.
-Yellow sauce.

1655
02:02:05,541 --> 02:02:07,585
And the chicken. The Kung Pao chicken.

1656
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:15,844
Can you turn the heater on?

1657
02:02:21,976 --> 02:02:24,270
Shit. I'm gonna go get the keys.

1658
02:02:38,119 --> 02:02:40,580
-Doc, give me the keys.
Here you go.

1659
02:02:46,379 --> 02:02:47,630
Doc!

1660
02:02:51,802 --> 02:02:53,595
Get out of the car.

1661
02:03:00,019 --> 02:03:01,980
You okay?
-Yeah.

1662
02:03:02,105 --> 02:03:03,106
Shit.

1663
02:03:03,273 --> 02:03:04,274
Come on.

1664
02:03:04,482 --> 02:03:06,443
Come on, baby. You all right?

1665
02:03:07,486 --> 02:03:08,737
Let's go.

1666
02:03:29,343 --> 02:03:31,054
Was it Nicky?

1667
02:03:32,556 --> 02:03:34,850
We'll go right now and fucking kill him
whether it was him or not,

1668
02:03:35,017 --> 02:03:36,977
you say the word, Frankie.

1669
02:03:38,478 --> 02:03:40,773
We got to do something, Frank.

1670
02:03:41,232 --> 02:03:42,233
We can't just sit here.

1671
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:43,860
We're leaving.

1672
02:03:46,947 --> 02:03:48,574
-All right, everybody get out.
You all right, man?

1673
02:03:48,741 --> 02:03:50,951
Go on home. It's Christmas time.
Go and be with your families.

1674
02:03:51,076 --> 02:03:52,328
I'm all right.

1675
02:03:52,536 --> 02:03:55,624
Go on. Go ahead. Be with your kids.

1676
02:03:55,790 --> 02:03:57,042
Go ahead.

1677
02:04:09,055 --> 02:04:10,056
Where are we gonna go, huh?

1678
02:04:10,264 --> 02:04:11,808
We're gonna go to Spain, somewhere?
China?

1679
02:04:11,975 --> 02:04:15,395
Huh? Come on, sit down.
Tell me where you want to go.

1680
02:04:16,104 --> 02:04:19,025
Frank, we can go anywhere we want.

1681
02:04:19,192 --> 02:04:20,735
-No, we can't.
-We can live anywhere, Frank.

1682
02:04:20,860 --> 02:04:22,820
Where? And do what? Run? Hide?

1683
02:04:22,987 --> 02:04:25,907
Frank Lucas don't run from nobody, baby.

1684
02:04:26,032 --> 02:04:27,743
We ain't going nowhere.
We're gonna stay right here.

1685
02:04:27,952 --> 02:04:30,162
We're gonna stay right here.
This is my home.

1686
02:04:30,329 --> 02:04:33,582
This is where my business is,
my wife, my mother, my family.

1687
02:04:33,749 --> 02:04:36,211
My country. I ain't going nowhere.

1688
02:04:36,795 --> 02:04:39,005
I ain't running from nobody!

1689
02:04:40,257 --> 02:04:41,883
This is America.

1690
02:04:48,808 --> 02:04:51,353
And you ain't going nowhere, either!

1691
02:04:53,605 --> 02:04:54,690
Huh?

1692
02:04:56,984 --> 02:04:59,111
A ceasefire, internationally supervised,

1693
02:04:59,236 --> 02:05:01,655
will begin at 7:00 p: M: This Saturday,
January 27th, Washington time:

1694
02:05:01,690 --> 02:05:04,075
Will begin at 7:00 p: M: This Saturday,
January 27th, Washington time:

1695
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:06,327
I'll call you back.

1696
02:05:06,494 --> 02:05:08,956
Hey! What are you doing?

1697
02:05:10,916 --> 02:05:12,084
Richie.

1698
02:05:15,964 --> 02:05:17,048
Wow.

1699
02:05:19,342 --> 02:05:24,056
So, what I hear it was the Corsican mob
took a shot at Frank.

1700
02:05:24,181 --> 02:05:26,058
You know, French Connection,
Fernando Rey,

1701
02:05:26,225 --> 02:05:29,395
the exporters that Frank
has put out of business.

1702
02:05:29,979 --> 02:05:32,107
Look, I can take care of him in New York.

1703
02:05:32,232 --> 02:05:33,609
I just don't want to have
to worry that every time

1704
02:05:33,775 --> 02:05:35,235
he drives across the bridge to Jersey,

1705
02:05:35,402 --> 02:05:38,155
someone's gonna take another shot at him.

1706
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:41,868
Richie, you and I gotta
start working together.

1707
02:05:42,035 --> 02:05:44,662
We need to step up our efforts.

1708
02:05:44,787 --> 02:05:47,457
Next time, their aim could be better.

1709
02:05:48,042 --> 02:05:50,669
We need to keep this cash cow alive.

1710
02:05:56,426 --> 02:05:58,637
What the fuck are you doing here?

1711
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:00,472
Whoa!

1712
02:06:03,725 --> 02:06:06,187
Were you actually gonna arrest
Frank Lucas?

1713
02:06:06,354 --> 02:06:07,730
What's the matter with you?

1714
02:06:08,064 --> 02:06:10,274
-What, you don't know?
-No.

1715
02:06:10,942 --> 02:06:13,946
Everybody in New Jersey's crazy.

1716
02:06:14,071 --> 02:06:17,407
You know what we do here?
Cops arrest bad guys.

1717
02:06:19,743 --> 02:06:21,704
Before you get on that bridge again,

1718
02:06:21,871 --> 02:06:25,208
you should call me first,
just make sure it's safe.

1719
02:06:28,420 --> 02:06:29,880
"I'm more enlightened
than some of my friends.

1720
02:06:30,047 --> 02:06:32,007
"I can guarantee you peace of mind."

1721
02:06:32,174 --> 02:06:34,385
That's what you told me, Dominic.

1722
02:06:35,719 --> 02:06:38,265
"I can guarantee you peace of mind!"

1723
02:06:38,431 --> 02:06:40,475
I don't feel so peaceful!

1724
02:06:41,935 --> 02:06:43,019
Huh?

1725
02:06:45,398 --> 02:06:47,525
They tried to kill my wife!

1726
02:06:52,113 --> 02:06:53,907
Who was that? Huh?

1727
02:06:55,909 --> 02:06:58,203
Maybe it was one of your peoples.

1728
02:06:58,370 --> 02:07:00,498
-I don't know yet. No.
-You don't know?

1729
02:07:00,665 --> 02:07:02,375
You don't know.

1730
02:07:03,626 --> 02:07:06,546
I'll tell you what I know.
Maybe I should just put 500 guns

1731
02:07:06,713 --> 02:07:08,757
out there on the street
and just start shooting up some people,

1732
02:07:08,882 --> 02:07:09,883
just to make a point.

1733
02:07:10,009 --> 02:07:13,262
Frank, it was a junkie. It was a rival.
Some dumb-ass kid

1734
02:07:13,429 --> 02:07:17,100
trying to make a name for himself.
Somebody you forgot to pay off.

1735
02:07:17,267 --> 02:07:20,186
Someone you slighted
without even realising it.

1736
02:07:20,312 --> 02:07:25,192
Could be someone you put out of business
from being so successful. Look at you.

1737
02:07:25,359 --> 02:07:28,863
Success, it's got enemies, Frank.
Lots of enemies.

1738
02:07:30,615 --> 02:07:33,076
So your success took a shot at you.
What are you gonna do now?

1739
02:07:33,285 --> 02:07:36,955
How you gonna kill it?
You're gonna become unsuccessful?

1740
02:07:37,915 --> 02:07:41,002
Frank, we can be successful
and have enemies, right?

1741
02:07:41,169 --> 02:07:45,048
Or we can be unsuccessful, too, you know,
we can have friends.

1742
02:07:45,214 --> 02:07:47,258
That's the choice we make.

1743
02:07:48,844 --> 02:07:52,431
The final evacuation of military
and diplomatic personnel

1744
02:07:52,598 --> 02:07:53,974
continued throughout the night,

1745
02:07:54,141 --> 02:07:57,145
as North Vietnamese troops
marched on Saigon:

1746
02:07:57,312 --> 02:08:02,442
The imminent fall of the city has brought
chaos and a growing sense of desperation:

1747
02:08:11,452 --> 02:08:14,873
-Operator:
-Yeah, Bangkok, 367, international.

1748
02:08:14,998 --> 02:08:16,375
One moment, please:

1749
02:08:24,926 --> 02:08:26,261
Yeah, Nate:

1750
02:08:26,386 --> 02:08:28,012
Hey, Frank. What's up, baby?

1751
02:08:28,179 --> 02:08:29,556
What's going on over there?

1752
02:08:29,682 --> 02:08:30,849
It's all over:

1753
02:08:30,975 --> 02:08:32,768
Yeah, I'm watching the news.
What the hell's going on?

1754
02:08:32,935 --> 02:08:34,561
The game's over, Frank:

1755
02:08:34,728 --> 02:08:36,021
-Huh?
-It's done.

1756
02:08:36,188 --> 02:08:38,149
Everybody going home, baby.
Give peace a chance.

1757
02:08:38,275 --> 02:08:39,609
Well, look, I'm not::: Listen to me:

1758
02:08:39,734 --> 02:08:41,278
I want two...

1759
02:08:42,404 --> 02:08:45,073
I want 2,000 keys in the air.

1760
02:08:45,198 --> 02:08:48,452
It's impossible, Frank:
All our resources are going home: It's over:

1761
02:08:48,577 --> 02:08:50,371
I'll tell you what. I'm on my way over there.

1762
02:08:50,496 --> 02:08:52,373
-Right now? Oh, come:::
-Yeah.

1763
02:08:59,756 --> 02:09:01,884
You stole my shit?

1764
02:09:02,051 --> 02:09:04,095
-Spearman, wake the fuck up, man.
-What?

1765
02:09:06,097 --> 02:09:07,640
Where's my shit, Darlynn?

1766
02:09:07,765 --> 02:09:09,727
Don't hurt me, Jimmy!

1767
02:09:11,353 --> 02:09:13,147
Jesus! What the... Police!
Police!

1768
02:09:13,314 --> 02:09:15,190
Drop the gun, Jimmy!
Drop the gun!

1769
02:09:15,357 --> 02:09:17,401
Let me see your hands!
Jimmy, drop the fucking gun!

1770
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:20,322
I'm not playing with you, Jimmy!
I'll blast your fucking head off!

1771
02:09:20,447 --> 02:09:22,407
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1772
02:09:23,992 --> 02:09:27,079
I got your gun and I got your prints.

1773
02:09:28,331 --> 02:09:32,543
You know what you got?
You got attempted murder.

1774
02:09:32,793 --> 02:09:34,921
Fifteen fucking years!

1775
02:09:35,088 --> 02:09:38,425
Attempted murder is the
same as Murder One, that's a grand jury.

1776
02:09:38,550 --> 02:09:40,761
Now, a grand jury could
come back favourably.

1777
02:09:40,928 --> 02:09:44,015
It could be reduced to manslaughter.

1778
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:46,267
All right? Maybe even self-defence.

1779
02:09:46,434 --> 02:09:48,311
It all just depends
on how we wanna deal with you.

1780
02:09:48,436 --> 02:09:50,314
See where this is fucking going, Jimmy?

1781
02:09:50,522 --> 02:09:51,607
Let's say you beat it.

1782
02:09:51,732 --> 02:09:53,943
What you think your cousin Frank
is gonna think?

1783
02:09:54,068 --> 02:09:56,362
Right, he is gonna know,
at some point in time,

1784
02:09:56,528 --> 02:09:58,990
we sat you down,
and we talked to you like this.

1785
02:09:59,115 --> 02:10:01,785
And then you go to court
and you beat attempted murder?

1786
02:10:01,910 --> 02:10:05,330
What's he gonna think?
Is he stupid? Is your cousin Frank stupid?

1787
02:10:05,497 --> 02:10:07,375
Answer him!

1788
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:10,252
No. He's going to assume that you talked.

1789
02:10:13,381 --> 02:10:15,759
But right now, Frank doesn't know.

1790
02:10:15,884 --> 02:10:18,261
You want Frank to read
about this in the papers?

1791
02:10:18,387 --> 02:10:20,347
Or do you just want to walk out of here?

1792
02:10:20,472 --> 02:10:24,060
No bail, no trial, no jail,
just walk out of here today:

1793
02:10:25,228 --> 02:10:26,688
Your choice:

1794
02:10:36,532 --> 02:10:40,996
Opium plants are hard enough
to outlive any war.

1795
02:10:42,289 --> 02:10:46,419
They'll still be here
long after the troops have gone.

1796
02:10:47,795 --> 02:10:52,425
What are you going to do for transportation
when the last US plane goes home?

1797
02:10:52,925 --> 02:10:54,886
I'll figure something out.

1798
02:10:56,471 --> 02:10:59,182
You will see me again, that's for sure.

1799
02:11:00,517 --> 02:11:03,605
It is not in my best interest
to say this, Frank,

1800
02:11:04,022 --> 02:11:06,941
but quitting while you're ahead

1801
02:11:07,650 --> 02:11:09,777
is not the same as quitting.

1802
02:11:51,408 --> 02:11:52,785
-Yeah.
-Hey:

1803
02:11:52,910 --> 02:11:53,911
Go get him.

1804
02:11:56,830 --> 02:11:59,125
-Whatever you want to do, baby.
-One second.

1805
02:11:59,250 --> 02:12:00,877
-It's Frank.
-Yeah.

1806
02:12:03,463 --> 02:12:04,464
Yeah.

1807
02:12:04,631 --> 02:12:05,924
Newark.

1808
02:12:06,841 --> 02:12:08,469
Short term,

1809
02:12:09,178 --> 02:12:11,389
parking lot three.

1810
02:12:11,555 --> 02:12:13,265
Short term, lot three.

1811
02:12:13,432 --> 02:12:16,603
That's the Mustang we talking about, right?
Okay, right. What's the plate number?

1812
02:12:16,770 --> 02:12:19,147
-K-A...
-K-A...

1813
02:12:19,314 --> 02:12:21,525
:: 760:
::: 76:

1814
02:12:21,650 --> 02:12:23,277
Zero: All right:

1815
02:12:24,612 --> 02:12:26,572
There's no short term lot three at Newark.

1816
02:12:26,739 --> 02:12:28,950
-They got letters. A-B-C-D.
-I know.

1817
02:12:29,117 --> 02:12:31,160
Maybe he means a time. 3:00?

1818
02:12:31,495 --> 02:12:36,292
This isn't no Jersey licence plate,
nor New York, for that matter.

1819
02:12:36,458 --> 02:12:39,211
-K-A-7-6-0?
-Yep.

1820
02:12:40,380 --> 02:12:42,007
Kilo Alpha?

1821
02:12:42,465 --> 02:12:44,092
A plane tail number?

1822
02:12:44,509 --> 02:12:46,469
Kilo Alpha 760.

1823
02:12:47,596 --> 02:12:50,433
You check commercial planes.
You guys check private planes.

1824
02:12:50,558 --> 02:12:53,144
Everything, from a little fucking Cessna
to the biggest fucking whatever jet.

1825
02:12:53,311 --> 02:12:54,395
All right?

1826
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:55,981
I'll check military planes.
Where you going, Jimmy?

1827
02:12:56,106 --> 02:12:58,942
You're not going anywhere. Sit... Sit down.

1828
02:13:21,676 --> 02:13:23,053
-Captain?
-Yeah?

1829
02:13:23,219 --> 02:13:27,098
Richie Roberts. Essex County.
I know you're expecting us.

1830
02:13:27,307 --> 02:13:30,061
Here's our warrant.
We're looking on the plane.

1831
02:13:30,227 --> 02:13:31,228
Wait! Wait!

1832
02:13:31,437 --> 02:13:34,774
Scotty, stop all these soldiers!
Check their bags. Every one of them.

1833
02:13:45,286 --> 02:13:47,163
No-knock warrant.

1834
02:13:47,747 --> 02:13:50,291
-All right. Start upstairs.
-Where are they going?

1835
02:13:50,416 --> 02:13:51,961
Step in, sweetie.

1836
02:13:52,378 --> 02:13:53,921
Ma'am, please sit down.

1837
02:13:54,088 --> 02:13:55,464
What is this?

1838
02:13:56,048 --> 02:13:59,468
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
All this stops! Hey. Hey. Hey.

1839
02:13:59,635 --> 02:14:02,889
Nothing leaves this area, all right?
Just slow down with this.

1840
02:14:03,056 --> 02:14:05,016
-All right. Stop these trucks.
Hold on, hold on.

1841
02:14:05,141 --> 02:14:07,018
Everything off the walls!
Just pull it all down.

1842
02:14:07,185 --> 02:14:08,354
Damn thing's a monster, Rich.

1843
02:14:08,479 --> 02:14:09,480
What is this?

1844
02:14:09,605 --> 02:14:10,773
Nothing leaves this area
till we've checked it.

1845
02:14:10,940 --> 02:14:12,233
All right, Captain. Nothing.

1846
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:14,443
We got to take the plane down,
we got to look in the trucks.

1847
02:14:14,568 --> 02:14:15,736
Every man here gets searched.

1848
02:14:15,861 --> 02:14:17,656
Read the warrant, sir.

1849
02:14:18,407 --> 02:14:21,159
Your husband's illustrious career is over.

1850
02:14:21,702 --> 02:14:24,872
The Feds are gonna come in,
gonna take everything.

1851
02:14:25,289 --> 02:14:29,502
And then they're gonna take it all.
But not before I get my gratuity.

1852
02:14:30,378 --> 02:14:31,587
So where's the money?

1853
02:14:31,754 --> 02:14:33,215
What are you talking about? What money?

1854
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:34,967
What am I talking about? What money?

1855
02:14:35,092 --> 02:14:39,138
The getaway money that Frank and
every other gangster keeps in his house.

1856
02:14:39,305 --> 02:14:43,059
If you leave now,
there's a chance Frank might not kill you.

1857
02:14:44,394 --> 02:14:45,937
Shut up! Sit down!

1858
02:14:46,104 --> 02:14:47,355
Sit down!

1859
02:15:28,068 --> 02:15:30,363
Defence today
announced the planned evacuation

1860
02:15:30,529 --> 02:15:33,532
of all remaining US
combat forces from Vietnam,

1861
02:15:33,658 --> 02:15:36,327
news that comes too late for some,

1862
02:15:36,494 --> 02:15:40,082
as here, on a solemn tarmac
at Dover Air Force Base:

1863
02:15:40,248 --> 02:15:43,752
This C-130,
loaded down with its sorrowful cargo,

1864
02:15:43,877 --> 02:15:48,007
a cargo of America's bravest and best,
en route to their final resting places:

1865
02:16:03,775 --> 02:16:05,318
You guys. Take this coffin down.

1866
02:16:13,786 --> 02:16:15,413
-Open it.
-I'm not doing that.

1867
02:16:22,212 --> 02:16:24,089
Great fucking dog, huh?

1868
02:16:32,140 --> 02:16:34,018
You stop this, right now.

1869
02:16:34,184 --> 02:16:37,521
My warrant gives me permission
to examine this plane,

1870
02:16:38,522 --> 02:16:40,232
the plane and its cargo.

1871
02:16:40,357 --> 02:16:42,819
Well, you don't have my permission.

1872
02:16:43,570 --> 02:16:44,904
I don't need it, Captain.

1873
02:16:46,489 --> 02:16:50,244
Easy! Easy, boy. Come on. Hey! Easy!

1874
02:16:50,411 --> 02:16:52,538
Frank, move out of the way.

1875
02:16:59,087 --> 02:17:00,339
Damn.

1876
02:17:05,218 --> 02:17:06,679
That's enough!

1877
02:17:14,229 --> 02:17:16,190
Stay with these coffins.
Do not let them out of your sight.

1878
02:17:16,315 --> 02:17:17,858
Got it. Okay.

1879
02:17:19,234 --> 02:17:21,362
Hey. Help me out with this.

1880
02:17:46,015 --> 02:17:48,393
That was a military transport plane.

1881
02:17:48,601 --> 02:17:49,686
If there was heroin onboard,

1882
02:17:49,852 --> 02:17:51,646
then someone in the military
would have to be involved.

1883
02:17:51,771 --> 02:17:56,235
Which means that even as it fights a war
that's claimed 50,000 American lives,

1884
02:17:56,360 --> 02:17:58,654
the military is smuggling narcotics.

1885
02:17:58,821 --> 02:18:01,365
That is how this event today
will be interpreted.

1886
02:18:01,532 --> 02:18:03,159
That someone employed by this office

1887
02:18:03,326 --> 02:18:06,830
believes that the United States Army
is in the drug trafficking business

1888
02:18:06,955 --> 02:18:10,292
and is trying to prove it
by desecrating the remains of young men

1889
02:18:10,418 --> 02:18:13,254
who have given their lives
in the defence of democracy!

1890
02:18:13,421 --> 02:18:15,881
-There is dope on that plane.
-Shut the fuck up!

1891
02:18:17,466 --> 02:18:20,804
Is it any wonder, then,
because of your actions,

1892
02:18:20,929 --> 02:18:23,056
the entire federal narcotics programme
is now in jeopardy

1893
02:18:23,223 --> 02:18:26,143
of being dismantled as completely
and enthusiastically

1894
02:18:26,310 --> 02:18:28,104
as that fucking transport plane?

1895
02:18:28,229 --> 02:18:30,690
That is what you've accomplished,
Mr Roberts, single-handedly.

1896
02:18:30,857 --> 02:18:32,900
I had good information.

1897
02:18:33,026 --> 02:18:36,447
That the target of my investigation
was bringing dope in on that plane.

1898
02:18:36,613 --> 02:18:38,490
-And that target is?
-Frank Lucas.

1899
02:18:38,615 --> 02:18:40,659
-Who?
-His name's Frank Lucas.

1900
02:18:40,826 --> 02:18:43,371
Who is Frank Lucas?
Who does he work for? Which family?

1901
02:18:43,496 --> 02:18:45,540
He's not Italian. He's black.

1902
02:18:48,877 --> 02:18:51,714
Is that supposed to be some kind of a joke?

1903
02:18:51,881 --> 02:18:54,091
You're this close to the end of your career
in law enforcement

1904
02:18:54,216 --> 02:18:56,761
and you're making fucking jokes?

1905
02:18:56,927 --> 02:18:59,139
My investigation indicates

1906
02:18:59,348 --> 02:19:02,684
that Frank Lucas is above the Mafia
in the dope business.

1907
02:19:02,851 --> 02:19:04,311
My investigations also indicate

1908
02:19:04,478 --> 02:19:08,608
that Frank Lucas buys direct
from a source in Southeast Asia.

1909
02:19:08,775 --> 02:19:11,861
He cuts out the middlemen
and uses US military planes

1910
02:19:12,028 --> 02:19:15,783
and personnel to transport
pure number 4 heroin into the United States

1911
02:19:15,949 --> 02:19:19,995
and he's been doing so
on a regular basis since 1969.

1912
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:22,957
I have cases against
every member of Frank's organisation.

1913
02:19:23,124 --> 02:19:24,209
Frank's organisation?

1914
02:19:24,376 --> 02:19:28,129
No fucking nigger has ever accomplished
what the American Mafia hasn't in 100 years!

1915
02:19:28,254 --> 02:19:29,339
And you would know that how? Why?

1916
02:19:29,506 --> 02:19:31,133
'Cause your head is stuck up
your fucking ass?

1917
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:33,594
Hey, Lou, do me a favour.
Will you get this fucking kike out of here?

1918
02:19:33,761 --> 02:19:35,137
Kike? Kike?

1919
02:19:35,304 --> 02:19:36,389
Richie, no.

1920
02:19:40,102 --> 02:19:41,561
Hey, Richie!

1921
02:19:42,479 --> 02:19:43,939
Make it stick.

1922
02:19:44,398 --> 02:19:47,026
Spearman's with the coffins.
They're about a quarter mile away.

1923
02:20:18,269 --> 02:20:19,521
Doctor.

1924
02:20:21,398 --> 02:20:22,482
What?

1925
02:20:22,941 --> 02:20:25,944
Fucking Trupo came by the house, man.
It's bad.

1926
02:20:40,836 --> 02:20:44,174
Frankie, I need to speak with you a minute.
Please?

1927
02:20:44,299 --> 02:20:46,843
-I got to go, Ma.
-No, sit down just a minute.

1928
02:20:46,968 --> 02:20:49,095
Would you please come back a little later?

1929
02:20:49,262 --> 02:20:50,263
Thank you.

1930
02:20:50,388 --> 02:20:52,767
-Ma, I got to go. All right?
-Just a few words.

1931
02:20:52,933 --> 02:20:54,310
Listen to me. I got...

1932
02:20:54,477 --> 02:20:56,771
Please, sit down. Just a few words.

1933
02:20:56,896 --> 02:20:58,439
I've been thinking about some things.

1934
02:20:58,564 --> 02:21:02,152
You know, if you'd been a preacher,
your brothers would have been preachers.

1935
02:21:02,319 --> 02:21:03,320
Right.

1936
02:21:03,445 --> 02:21:07,282
If you'd been a soldier, they'd be soldiers.
You know that.

1937
02:21:07,407 --> 02:21:10,995
They came here because of you.
You called and they came running.

1938
02:21:11,162 --> 02:21:12,163
Right.

1939
02:21:12,330 --> 02:21:15,750
That's because they look up to you.

1940
02:21:15,876 --> 02:21:20,089
They always expect you
to know what's best.

1941
02:21:20,422 --> 02:21:22,549
But even they know

1942
02:21:22,716 --> 02:21:24,427
you don't shoot cops.

1943
02:21:26,638 --> 02:21:28,264
Even I know that.

1944
02:21:29,516 --> 02:21:30,767
-Eva knows it.
-All right, Ma.

1945
02:21:30,934 --> 02:21:33,479
The only one who doesn't seem to know
is you!

1946
02:21:33,604 --> 02:21:36,857
All right, Ma. I got to go.
I promise you, I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

1947
02:21:36,982 --> 02:21:40,570
I never asked you where all this came from
because I didn't want to hear you lie.

1948
02:21:40,696 --> 02:21:42,739
I didn't want you to worry about it.
Now, come on, I got to go.

1949
02:21:42,906 --> 02:21:44,449
Don't lie to me!

1950
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:50,540
Don't do that.

1951
02:21:51,958 --> 02:21:55,294
Do you want to make things so bad

1952
02:21:55,461 --> 02:21:58,298
for your family that they'll leave you?
Because they will.

1953
02:21:58,424 --> 02:21:59,425
They'll understand.

1954
02:21:59,550 --> 02:22:01,844
She will leave you.

1955
02:22:01,969 --> 02:22:03,512
All right, Mama.

1956
02:22:06,016 --> 02:22:07,642
I will leave you!

1957
02:22:35,381 --> 02:22:36,717
Got coffins on the move, Richie.

1958
02:22:36,842 --> 02:22:40,262
We want the transport coffins,
not the ceremonial ones.

1959
02:22:41,513 --> 02:22:43,140
Who are these guys?

1960
02:22:45,226 --> 02:22:46,770
What does it say?

1961
02:22:49,606 --> 02:22:52,150
Bayonne Custodial Services?

1962
02:22:52,317 --> 02:22:53,861
Bayonne Cleaning Services?

1963
02:22:54,028 --> 02:22:55,196
Bayonne? What the fuck is that?

1964
02:22:55,321 --> 02:22:57,114
Give me the camera, Al.

1965
02:22:59,784 --> 02:23:00,869
Bingo.

1966
02:23:01,036 --> 02:23:03,789
Holy shit. That's the baseball kid.

1967
02:23:03,955 --> 02:23:05,916
Oh, yeah. That's Stevie Lucas.

1968
02:23:06,041 --> 02:23:08,585
So what you want to do, Richie?
Follow the trucks?

1969
02:23:08,753 --> 02:23:11,839
No. No.
I wanna stay here with the Lucas kid.

1970
02:23:11,964 --> 02:23:13,591
We'll follow that van.

1971
02:23:13,716 --> 02:23:17,054
You guys better eat up.
We're gonna have a long night.

1972
02:23:27,899 --> 02:23:31,820
Come on, more precious than gold,
man. This is more precious than gold.

1973
02:23:31,986 --> 02:23:34,907
We got a couple more.
Let's go. Stack that up.

1974
02:23:35,491 --> 02:23:37,451
Take it. Take it.

1975
02:23:37,576 --> 02:23:39,954
Give me a second, man,
give me a second.

1976
02:23:41,164 --> 02:23:44,668
Hey. Yo. We got four caskets left, man.
Let's make some fucking money in here.

1977
02:23:47,337 --> 02:23:48,422
What are they loading in there?

1978
02:23:48,588 --> 02:23:49,757
What the fuck
are they loading in there?

1979
02:23:49,924 --> 02:23:50,925
That's the dope.

1980
02:23:51,092 --> 02:23:54,011
That's got to be the dope! It's got to be.

1981
02:23:54,679 --> 02:23:55,930
Let's go.

1982
02:23:56,848 --> 02:23:58,308
Let's move.

1983
02:24:50,992 --> 02:24:52,369
Lou, it's Richie.

1984
02:24:52,494 --> 02:24:54,997
We got everybody in place. Everybody.

1985
02:24:55,164 --> 02:24:56,248
Are you sure this is it?

1986
02:24:56,374 --> 02:24:58,167
I'm positive, man. Okay?

1987
02:24:58,334 --> 02:24:59,960
All right, they're cutting and bagging

1988
02:25:00,127 --> 02:25:02,881
in the South Tower
of the Stephen Crane Projects right now.

1989
02:25:03,048 --> 02:25:05,175
Are you sure this is it?
You're positive?

1990
02:25:05,342 --> 02:25:08,178
I'm positive, Lou: I'm positive: Okay?

1991
02:25:08,303 --> 02:25:10,681
Everything is ready to go:
All the guys are ready to go:

1992
02:25:10,807 --> 02:25:13,101
Just push the button,
give me the warrant, okay?

1993
02:25:13,267 --> 02:25:14,811
Okay. You got it.

1994
02:25:22,444 --> 02:25:23,904
You all right?

1995
02:26:16,380 --> 02:26:18,507
-Got the warrant.
-All right.

1996
02:26:22,053 --> 02:26:23,597
Let's go!

1997
02:26:40,449 --> 02:26:41,658
Move!

1998
02:26:44,745 --> 02:26:47,207
-Hi, ma'am. What's your name?
-What's going on here?

1999
02:26:48,208 --> 02:26:50,168
Get down! Get down, motherfucker!

2000
02:26:51,252 --> 02:26:53,922
-Go.
-Okay. Let's go, Al!

2001
02:26:54,255 --> 02:26:55,966
Move it, come on.

2002
02:26:56,967 --> 02:26:58,928
Come on, move it. Move it!

2003
02:27:41,267 --> 02:27:42,351
All set.

2004
02:27:43,145 --> 02:27:44,312
Roger.

2005
02:27:45,939 --> 02:27:46,940
Get ready.

2006
02:27:47,232 --> 02:27:49,109
There you go!
All right.

2007
02:27:51,153 --> 02:27:52,155
Come on.

2008
02:28:00,330 --> 02:28:01,582
At target.

2009
02:28:02,374 --> 02:28:04,418
Spearman, stand by.

2010
02:28:04,585 --> 02:28:06,962
I got civilians on the target floor:

2011
02:28:09,799 --> 02:28:11,426
What? Oh...

2012
02:28:11,926 --> 02:28:13,470
Come on, there you go.

2013
02:28:13,595 --> 02:28:15,138
Hey, Tim.

2014
02:28:15,263 --> 02:28:17,391
Girl, why don't you get
some clothes on?

2015
02:28:21,979 --> 02:28:23,147
Let's go.

2016
02:28:29,821 --> 02:28:31,364
You think you bad, huh?

2017
02:28:35,828 --> 02:28:38,498
Hold on. Where you going?
Where you going?

2018
02:28:38,623 --> 02:28:39,792
Come on!

2019
02:28:41,794 --> 02:28:43,128
I'll get it!

2020
02:28:45,380 --> 02:28:46,840
Where's Tim?

2021
02:28:47,842 --> 02:28:49,219
Quiet, kid!

2022
02:28:55,893 --> 02:28:58,646
I got some sandwiches for you boys, man.

2023
02:29:00,564 --> 02:29:02,191
But where's Tim?

2024
02:29:02,316 --> 02:29:04,820
Shit. Man, Tim always playing around.

2025
02:29:06,238 --> 02:29:07,489
Hey, man!

2026
02:29:07,823 --> 02:29:09,699
You got some Blue Magic, baby?

2027
02:29:11,159 --> 02:29:12,620
Fucking junkie!

2028
02:29:13,496 --> 02:29:14,872
Yo, handle that!

2029
02:29:15,039 --> 02:29:16,499
I'm sick! Come on! I got money, man!

2030
02:29:16,666 --> 02:29:18,459
Come on, man, you know me, baby!

2031
02:29:18,626 --> 02:29:21,380
Come on!
Come on, I need that Blue Magic, man.

2032
02:29:21,505 --> 02:29:22,881
It's me, Boogaloo, baby.

2033
02:29:23,048 --> 02:29:26,135
Hey, man, you know I got
your god damn money. Come on, man.

2034
02:29:26,260 --> 02:29:28,388
-And one, two, three!
Fucking junkie.

2035
02:29:30,223 --> 02:29:32,100
Police! Police!

2036
02:29:32,267 --> 02:29:33,977
-Drop it!
Get out, get out!

2037
02:29:34,102 --> 02:29:35,186
-Drop the gun!
-Don't do it!

2038
02:29:35,311 --> 02:29:37,273
-Drop the gun, drop it!
-Don't do it.

2039
02:29:39,525 --> 02:29:40,818
Scotty!

2040
02:29:44,197 --> 02:29:45,741
Police! Everybody down!

2041
02:29:48,201 --> 02:29:49,369
You motherfucker!

2042
02:29:52,498 --> 02:29:54,542
Police! Nobody move!
-Look out!

2043
02:30:02,718 --> 02:30:04,595
Don't fucking move!

2044
02:30:14,564 --> 02:30:15,113
I want to see your hands!
All the hands!

2045
02:30:15,148 --> 02:30:17,109
I want to see your hands!
All the hands!

2046
02:30:17,234 --> 02:30:18,235
Police!

2047
02:30:21,864 --> 02:30:23,991
Down! Down! Get down!

2048
02:30:24,116 --> 02:30:25,827
Stay the fuck down!

2049
02:31:17,635 --> 02:31:19,929
Hey, man, what's going on?

2050
02:31:25,185 --> 02:31:26,645
What the hell...

2051
02:31:39,160 --> 02:31:41,454
Stay down! Down, motherfucker! Stay down!

2052
02:31:41,620 --> 02:31:43,164
Hands! Hands!

2053
02:31:48,086 --> 02:31:49,796
Out at home, baby.

2054
02:32:01,017 --> 02:32:03,312
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

2055
02:32:03,520 --> 02:32:05,981
Y'all wait right here. Wait right here.

2056
02:32:30,634 --> 02:32:33,220
-Mrs Lucas, please step back inside.
-Yes, Officer.

2057
02:32:33,386 --> 02:32:34,639
Please, Mother Lucas, step inside, please.

2058
02:32:34,806 --> 02:32:38,142
Respectfully, ma'am, please step inside.
Thank you. Step inside.

2059
02:32:49,488 --> 02:32:51,866
Hands up against the wall. Stay back.

2060
02:32:54,244 --> 02:32:55,578
Oh, man.

2061
02:32:55,703 --> 02:32:58,415
Don't you owe me money?
I'll get you some more. Here you go.

2062
02:33:00,251 --> 02:33:02,294
Yo, yo! Pigs! Look out!

2063
02:33:02,461 --> 02:33:04,505
NYPD! Everybody stand still!

2064
02:33:07,592 --> 02:33:09,136
Turner! Go!

2065
02:33:10,637 --> 02:33:12,681
Down on the ground, motherfucker!

2066
02:33:46,845 --> 02:33:51,475
...dead servicemen returning
from defending our country in Vietnam...

2067
02:33:54,019 --> 02:33:56,939
Over there. Okay.

2068
02:34:02,529 --> 02:34:05,449
Ladies and gentlemen,
at this stage of the proceedings

2069
02:34:05,616 --> 02:34:08,869
the counsels are ready
for their opening statements.

2070
02:34:09,036 --> 02:34:12,040
For the prosecution,
Mr Roberts will proceed

2071
02:34:12,207 --> 02:34:14,417
with his opening statement first.

2072
02:34:14,959 --> 02:34:18,798
Mr Roberts, are you ready to proceed?

2073
02:34:20,591 --> 02:34:22,218
Yes, Your Honour.

2074
02:34:26,138 --> 02:34:28,642
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

2075
02:34:33,063 --> 02:34:36,901
the State will show and you will hear

2076
02:34:37,068 --> 02:34:40,905
that Frank Lucas is the most dangerous man

2077
02:34:41,030 --> 02:34:43,242
walking the streets of our city.

2078
02:34:46,036 --> 02:34:49,957
All right, y'all, get on out.
Let me talk to Mr Richie alone.

2079
02:34:53,044 --> 02:34:57,257
Come on, come on, come on.
I pay y'all by the hour, not by the minute.

2080
02:34:59,260 --> 02:35:00,553
Thank you.

2081
02:35:05,391 --> 02:35:07,769
You ain't wearing a wire, are you?

2082
02:35:08,436 --> 02:35:09,729
No.

2083
02:35:10,522 --> 02:35:13,442
All right. I was talking to my lawyers.

2084
02:35:13,567 --> 02:35:16,487
They said something to me,
I can't believe it.

2085
02:35:17,447 --> 02:35:20,616
Did you really find a million dollars
in the trunk of a car

2086
02:35:20,783 --> 02:35:22,493
-and then turn it in? Did you do that?
-Yeah.

2087
02:35:22,618 --> 02:35:23,996
You did that for real, huh?

2088
02:35:24,121 --> 02:35:27,458
My man. Good for you. Shit.

2089
02:35:27,624 --> 02:35:29,668
You know Johnny Law got it though, right?

2090
02:35:29,793 --> 02:35:31,754
-Maybe.
-Ain't no maybe about it, Mr Richie.

2091
02:35:31,880 --> 02:35:34,090
You know he got it.
You turned that money in,

2092
02:35:34,215 --> 02:35:36,885
he took it and you ain't get nothing for it.
Did you?

2093
02:35:37,010 --> 02:35:38,720
Why did you do that?

2094
02:35:38,845 --> 02:35:41,599
-It was the right thing to do.
-That's true.

2095
02:35:41,765 --> 02:35:43,392
That's a good answer.
It was the right thing to do.

2096
02:35:43,559 --> 02:35:45,686
The question I have,
the question I've been asking myself is,

2097
02:35:45,853 --> 02:35:47,647
would you do it again?

2098
02:35:48,732 --> 02:35:51,902
I mean, that's a lot of money,
that's a long time ago.

2099
02:35:52,068 --> 02:35:55,573
Many car payments ago,
many child support payments ago.

2100
02:35:57,366 --> 02:36:01,204
So I said to myself,
the onlyest way to find out is to find out.

2101
02:36:02,747 --> 02:36:08,504
Bribery, extortion, murder,
racketeering...

2102
02:36:10,589 --> 02:36:12,217
Now, you give me an address,

2103
02:36:12,342 --> 02:36:15,762
I'll make sure the car's there,
I'll make sure that money's in that trunk.

2104
02:36:15,929 --> 02:36:17,388
No, thanks.

2105
02:36:17,514 --> 02:36:18,807
You sure?

2106
02:36:20,684 --> 02:36:23,521
Come on, now, Richie.
What do you think, that impresses me?

2107
02:36:23,687 --> 02:36:26,398
You think that you're better than them?
You ain't no better than them other cops.

2108
02:36:26,524 --> 02:36:29,861
In fact, you're the same as them.
You are them.

2109
02:36:30,028 --> 02:36:31,029
Let me ask you this.

2110
02:36:31,196 --> 02:36:34,366
Do you really think that
putting me behind bars

2111
02:36:34,533 --> 02:36:36,327
is going to change anything
on them streets?

2112
02:36:36,452 --> 02:36:37,912
Them dope fiends is gonna shoot it,

2113
02:36:38,037 --> 02:36:40,248
they're gonna steal for it,
they're gonna die for it.

2114
02:36:40,414 --> 02:36:43,501
Putting me in or out
ain't gonna change one thing.

2115
02:36:43,626 --> 02:36:44,795
Then that's the way it is.

2116
02:36:44,920 --> 02:36:46,964
That's just the way it is.
So what we got, Richie?

2117
02:36:47,089 --> 02:36:49,299
We got me and you sitting here.

2118
02:36:49,466 --> 02:36:51,928
We got that little snitch-ass driver
for my brother:

2119
02:36:52,053 --> 02:36:53,930
You got a little bit of powder:

2120
02:36:54,055 --> 02:36:55,765
You're going to need more than that, Richie:

2121
02:36:55,932 --> 02:36:59,435
I got possession, supply,
conspiracy,

2122
02:36:59,644 --> 02:37:03,691
bribing a law officer: I got people who'll
attest to seeing you kill in cold blood:

2123
02:37:03,858 --> 02:37:07,778
I got your offshore bank accounts,
your real estate, your businesses,

2124
02:37:07,903 --> 02:37:10,824
all bought with money from heroin.

2125
02:37:10,949 --> 02:37:13,785
And I got hundreds of parents of dead kids.

2126
02:37:13,910 --> 02:37:16,372
Addicts who OD'ed on your product.
And that's my story for the jury.

2127
02:37:16,497 --> 02:37:20,168
And that's how I make it all stick.
"This man murdered thousands of people.

2128
02:37:20,293 --> 02:37:22,170
"And he did it from a penthouse,
driving a Lincoln."

2129
02:37:22,295 --> 02:37:24,005
Aside from that,
you got nothing to worry about.

2130
02:37:24,173 --> 02:37:27,009
That's pretty good. But that's why
we go to court, isn't it, Richie?

2131
02:37:27,134 --> 02:37:28,677
'Cause I got witnesses, too.

2132
02:37:28,802 --> 02:37:32,724
I got celebrities.
I got sports figures. I got Harlem, Richie.

2133
02:37:33,308 --> 02:37:37,061
I took care of Harlem, so Harlem's
gonna take care of me. You can believe that.

2134
02:37:37,228 --> 02:37:39,689
-I got more than that, Frank.
-What you got?

2135
02:37:39,814 --> 02:37:42,485
I've got a line of people
wanting to testify against you,

2136
02:37:42,610 --> 02:37:44,904
it stretches out the door
and around the block.

2137
02:37:45,070 --> 02:37:48,825
You damaged a lot of lives, Frank:
I got the Mazzano crime family:

2138
02:37:48,992 --> 02:37:50,535
Remember those boys?
You put them out of business:

2139
02:37:50,702 --> 02:37:52,078
I ain't got nothing to do with no Mazzanos.

2140
02:37:52,204 --> 02:37:53,371
Mazzanos ain't got nothing to do with me.

2141
02:37:53,538 --> 02:37:54,915
-They got everything to do with you.
-What, they...

2142
02:37:55,040 --> 02:37:56,124
-You know why?
-Why?

2143
02:37:56,291 --> 02:37:59,212
Because apart from the fact
that they hate you personally,

2144
02:37:59,378 --> 02:38:00,546
they hate what you represent.

2145
02:38:00,713 --> 02:38:04,217
-I don't represent nothing but Frank Lucas.
-You sure?

2146
02:38:04,383 --> 02:38:06,428
A black businessman like you?

2147
02:38:06,553 --> 02:38:08,680
You represent progress.

2148
02:38:08,847 --> 02:38:12,267
The kind of progress
that's going to see them lose a lot of money.

2149
02:38:12,392 --> 02:38:15,897
With you out of the way,
everything can return to normal.

2150
02:38:17,106 --> 02:38:18,274
My man.

2151
02:38:23,155 --> 02:38:25,449
You know what normal is to me, Richie?

2152
02:38:25,574 --> 02:38:28,577
I ain't seen normal since I was six years old.

2153
02:38:29,996 --> 02:38:32,541
Normal is seeing the police
right up to my house

2154
02:38:32,707 --> 02:38:35,627
dragging my little 12-year-old cousin out,
tying him to a pole,

2155
02:38:35,752 --> 02:38:38,840
shoving a shotgun in his mouth
so hard they bust his teeth.

2156
02:38:39,006 --> 02:38:42,260
Then they bust two shotgun shells
in his head and knock his fucking head off.

2157
02:38:42,385 --> 02:38:43,553
That's what normal is to me.

2158
02:38:43,719 --> 02:38:46,723
I didn't give a fuck about no police then.

2159
02:38:46,890 --> 02:38:49,810
I don't give a fuck about
no police now. Shit.

2160
02:38:50,227 --> 02:38:52,437
You know what,
you can do whatever you want to do.

2161
02:38:52,604 --> 02:38:55,066
So, it don't mean nothing to me
for you to show up tomorrow morning

2162
02:38:55,233 --> 02:38:58,069
with your head blown off.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

2163
02:38:58,236 --> 02:39:03,576
Yeah, Frank. Get in line.
That one stretches around the block, too.

2164
02:39:06,996 --> 02:39:08,330
All right.

2165
02:39:12,169 --> 02:39:13,545
What do you want to do?

2166
02:39:20,178 --> 02:39:21,804
You know what you got to do.

2167
02:39:21,929 --> 02:39:23,639
What do you want me to do? Snitch, huh?

2168
02:39:23,806 --> 02:39:25,267
I know you don't want me
to give up no cops.

2169
02:39:25,392 --> 02:39:27,436
What do you want? You want gangsters?

2170
02:39:27,561 --> 02:39:31,315
Pick one. Jew gangsters?
Mick gangsters? Guineas?

2171
02:39:31,815 --> 02:39:34,527
They've been bleeding Harlem dry
since they got off the boat, Richie.

2172
02:39:34,652 --> 02:39:38,406
I don't give a fuck about no crime figures.
You can have them.

2173
02:39:39,532 --> 02:39:41,075
I'll take them, too.

2174
02:39:41,242 --> 02:39:43,120
You'll take them, too?

2175
02:39:48,292 --> 02:39:51,963
No, you didn't. You're talking about police.
You want police?

2176
02:39:52,589 --> 02:39:53,590
You want your own kind?

2177
02:39:53,715 --> 02:39:55,592
They're not my kind.

2178
02:39:55,759 --> 02:39:58,429
They're in business with you, Frank.
They ain't my kind.

2179
02:39:58,554 --> 02:40:02,391
They ain't my kind
like the Italians are not yours. All right?

2180
02:40:05,729 --> 02:40:06,730
Huh.

2181
02:40:16,074 --> 02:40:18,451
What can you promise me, Richie?

2182
02:40:21,454 --> 02:40:24,875
I can promise you, you lie about one name,

2183
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:26,877
you'll never get out of prison.

2184
02:40:27,002 --> 02:40:29,672
You lie about one dollar,
in one offshore account,

2185
02:40:29,840 --> 02:40:32,050
you'll never get out of prison.

2186
02:40:33,218 --> 02:40:37,430
Now you can live life rich in jail
for the rest of your born days,

2187
02:40:37,974 --> 02:40:40,518
or be poor outside for some of them.

2188
02:40:41,519 --> 02:40:43,813
That's what I can promise you.

2189
02:40:46,692 --> 02:40:52,781
I want them cops, Richie.
That's what I want, I want them cops

2190
02:40:54,159 --> 02:40:57,328
that took that money out of my pockets.

2191
02:41:00,123 --> 02:41:01,666
Him, too.

2192
02:41:01,791 --> 02:41:03,669
All right. Okay.

2193
02:41:05,546 --> 02:41:07,756
Hey, Spearman? Spearman.

2194
02:41:08,465 --> 02:41:11,011
So these guys are all connected up
to Gywnn, all right.

2195
02:41:11,178 --> 02:41:13,722
See this guy here, he's in uniform...

2196
02:41:14,639 --> 02:41:16,850
Four police officers were arrested today

2197
02:41:17,017 --> 02:41:19,478
on charges of taking bribes
from drug traffickers:

2198
02:41:19,687 --> 02:41:20,855
Well done, Jimmy.

2199
02:41:20,980 --> 02:41:23,107
The investigation into police corruption

2200
02:41:23,232 --> 02:41:26,320
has swept through New York's
drug enforcement ranks

2201
02:41:26,487 --> 02:41:29,823
broadened today with
the arrest of 19 more officers:

2202
02:41:30,908 --> 02:41:34,579
In what is being called
this city's largest police corruption scandal,

2203
02:41:34,746 --> 02:41:38,875
32 more officers were indicted
today in federal court on bribery charges:

2204
02:41:39,042 --> 02:41:42,128
These police officers
will face stiff prison terms,

2205
02:41:42,338 --> 02:41:45,174
say federal prosecutors, if found guilty:

2206
02:41:45,341 --> 02:41:47,801
A report
by federal investigators into New York's

2207
02:41:47,927 --> 02:41:49,970
ever widening police corruption scandal

2208
02:41:50,137 --> 02:41:52,682
claims that more than
half of the city's officers

2209
02:41:52,891 --> 02:41:57,020
assigned to drug enforcement
have engaged in some form of corruption:

2210
02:41:58,063 --> 02:42:01,317
Allegations of widespread corruption within

2211
02:42:01,484 --> 02:42:03,861
the elite narcotics squad SIU

2212
02:42:04,070 --> 02:42:07,491
have led to the arrest of
more New York City detectives:

2213
02:42:07,783 --> 02:42:09,034
Convicted of extortion,

2214
02:42:09,201 --> 02:42:12,371
members of New York City's
Special Investigations Narcotics Unit

2215
02:42:12,579 --> 02:42:15,583
will face sentencing today in federal court:

2216
02:42:17,544 --> 02:42:20,380
MacNamara. Vendazzo.

2217
02:42:21,631 --> 02:42:22,883
Trupo.

2218
02:42:26,262 --> 02:42:27,638
You are special.

2219
02:43:11,146 --> 02:43:13,023
It's good work, Frank.

2220
02:43:14,274 --> 02:43:15,650
You know...

2221
02:43:15,859 --> 02:43:19,447
You don't want a drink or something?
Celebrate?

2222
02:43:20,072 --> 02:43:21,949
You got any holy water?

2223
02:44:16,594 --> 02:44:19,264
Check your property. Sign, please.

2224
02:45:11,197 --> 02:45:14,534
Smell better out here?

2225
02:45:32,971 --> 02:45:35,432
Frank. There you are.

2226
02:45:36,266 --> 02:45:38,728
-Caffe latte. Yeah.
-Latte?

2227
02:45:38,895 --> 02:45:41,731
-Oh, shit. Yeah.
-You all right?

2228
02:45:41,940 --> 02:45:44,818
That's a fancy way of saying
coffee with milk.

2229
02:45:44,985 --> 02:45:46,320
-Yeah.
-$2.50.

2230
02:45:49,865 --> 02:45:52,243
So you been talking to your brothers?

2231
02:45:52,409 --> 02:45:55,747
No, no, I ain't talked to them in years.
It's probably best for them.

2232
02:45:59,751 --> 02:46:04,131
What the hell am I going to do out here,
Richie? I don't know how I'm gonna live.

2233
02:46:06,425 --> 02:46:09,429
Hey, I told ya, I ain't gonna let you starve,
all right?

2234
02:46:09,596 --> 02:46:11,014
Obviously, you ain't starving.

2235
02:46:12,307 --> 02:46:15,310
Bagels and blinches. They will catch up
with you, you know?

2236
02:46:19,566 --> 02:46:20,567
Who's this?

2237
02:46:21,276 --> 02:46:23,987
Expensive sneakers. About $100 a pair.

2238
02:46:33,415 --> 02:46:35,292
Frederick Douglass Boulevard.

2239
02:46:36,626 --> 02:46:40,046
This used to be Eighth Avenue, why do they
call it Frederick Douglass Boulevard now?

2240
02:46:45,845 --> 02:46:48,848
This was me Richie, right here.
This was all me.

2241
02:46:50,392 --> 02:46:52,519
In my day there were so many niggers
out here buying dope

2242
02:46:52,644 --> 02:46:55,314
you could've made a Tarzan movie.

2243
02:46:56,064 --> 02:46:59,569
You know, one phone call, I'll be right back
in business, you know that.

2244
02:46:59,694 --> 02:47:03,031
You don't do that, Frank.
These days I keep all my promises.

2245
02:47:14,252 --> 02:47:16,546
Why'd you come and get me, huh?

2246
02:47:16,713 --> 02:47:18,590
You're a superstar, Frank.

2247
02:47:18,757 --> 02:47:19,925
A superstar?

2248
02:47:21,176 --> 02:47:25,223
Your evidence alone
gave me 150 convictions.

2249
02:47:25,723 --> 02:47:28,726
Thought the least we could do
is give you a ride home.

2250
02:47:29,143 --> 02:47:32,981
Yeah, you sure did that.
You gave me a ride home. Free ride.

2251
02:47:33,523 --> 02:47:35,901
Coming to gangsters.

2252
02:47:39,697 --> 02:47:40,698
What?

2253
02:47:43,159 --> 02:47:46,080
Ain't nothin', man. Ain't nothin', man.

2254
02:47:46,914 --> 02:47:49,041
That's life right there. That's life right there.

2255
02:47:49,500 --> 02:47:52,670
Even a fool gets to be young once.
