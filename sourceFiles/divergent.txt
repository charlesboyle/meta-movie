1
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:37,257
<i>We're lucky to be in The City.
They say the war was terrible.</i>

2
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:40,360
<i>That the rest of the
world was destroyed.</i>

3
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:43,263
<i>Our founders built the
wall to keep us safe</i>

4
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,508
<i>and they divided us
into five groups,</i>

5
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:48,767
<i>factions, to keep the peace.</i>

6
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,539
<i>The smart ones, the ones who
value knowledge and logic</i>

7
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,308
<i>are in Erudite.</i>

8
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,512
<i>They know everything.</i>

9
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:03,049
<i>Amity farm the land.</i>

10
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,485
<i>They're all about kindness
and harmony, always happy.</i>

11
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,392
<i>Candor value honesty and order.</i>

12
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:16,027
<i>They tell the truth, even
when you wish they wouldn't.</i>

13
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,931
<i>And then there's Dauntless.</i>

14
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:23,903
<i>They're our protectors,
our soldiers, our police.</i>

15
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,704
<i>I always thought they were amazing.</i>

16
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:32,176
<i>Brave, fearless and free.</i>

17
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:35,815
<i>Some people think
Dauntless are crazy,</i>

18
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,017
<i>which they kind of are.</i>

19
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,720
Come on, Beatrice.

20
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,755
<i>My faction is Abnegation.</i>

21
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,257
<i>The others all call us "stiffs."</i>

22
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,560
<i>We lead a simple life,</i>

23
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,763
<i>selfless, dedicated
to helping others.</i>

24
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,965
<i>We even feed the Factionless,</i>

25
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,366
<i>the ones who don't fit in anywhere.</i>

26
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,438
<i>Because we're public servants,</i>

27
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,374
<i>we're trusted to run
the government.</i>

28
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:05,076
<i>My father works alongside
our leader, Marcus.</i>

29
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,649
<i>It all works. Everyone
knows where they belong.</i>

30
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,218
<i>Except for me.</i>

31
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:28,318
<i>My mother says there's an
art to losing yourself.</i>

32
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,039
<i>But I haven't figured it out yet.</i>

33
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,541
<i>I'm supposed to never
think of myself,</i>

34
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,109
<i>to always help others.</i>

35
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,246
<i>To never look too
long in the mirror.</i>

36
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,586
Are you nervous?

37
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,754
No.

38
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,459
Were you? For your test?

39
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,193
Mmm-mm. No.

40
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,562
I was terrified.

41
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:02,433
But I didn't have any reason
to be and neither do you.

42
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,543
That's all you get.

43
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,647
Rules are rules.

44
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,223
<i>Today I take the test.</i>

45
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:31,063
<i>I'm scared it'll tell me
I'm not Abnegation.</i>

46
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,664
<i>That I have to leave my family.</i>

47
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,302
<i>But I'm even more scared
that it will tell me to stay.</i>

48
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,908
<i>For my brother Caleb, it's easy.</i>

49
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:42,942
Let me help you with that.

50
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,276
<i>He's a natural.</i>

51
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,648
Beatrice, do you wanna
get the other bags?

52
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:49,682
Sorry.

53
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,485
What if she'd been blind or an amputee?
Would you have helped her then?

54
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:55,755
- I was thinking about helping her.
- It's not that hard.

55
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,057
For you, maybe.

56
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:01,678
Just relax, Beatrice. Take a
deep breath and trust the test.

57
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,664
<i>Trust the test.</i>

58
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,698
<i>Test will tell me who
I am, where I belong.</i>

59
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,969
<i>Am I smart?</i>

60
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,907
<i>Kind? Am I honest?</i>

61
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,514
<i>Selfless? Or brave?</i>

62
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:25,551
Hey. So, all the food
that we're not getting,

63
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,787
you guys are giving away
to the Factionless?

64
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,722
- Right? Yeah?
- Yeah.

65
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,658
You're a liar. Why
are you lying to me?

66
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,160
Everybody knows you
keep it for yourselves.

67
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:38,431
So why don't you
just admit it? Huh?

68
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:42,212
I'm talking to you. Are all you
stiffs deaf or somethin'? Hey!

69
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,702
Beatrice...

70
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,837
Don't.

71
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,073
One hundred years
ago, after the war,

72
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,309
our founders created a
system they believed

73
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,812
would prevent future conflict
and create lasting peace.

74
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,749
Today, aptitude testing
based on your personality

75
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,919
will assign you to
one of the factions.

76
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,954
While it is our belief
that choosing the faction

77
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:39,759
indicated by your test is the best way to
ensure success within the faction system,

78
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,862
it is your right tomorrow
at the choosing ceremony

79
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:47,099
<i>to choose any of the five factions,
regardless of your test results.</i>

80
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:53,404
<i>However, once the choice has been made,
there will be no change permitted.</i>

81
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,591
What is it with you
Abnegation and mirrors?

82
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,729
We reject vanity.

83
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,562
Yeah. I know. Sit down.

84
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,647
I'm Tori. I'll be
administering your test.

85
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,716
You'll be offered a
series of choices

86
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,918
to test your aptitude
for each faction

87
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,319
until you get one result.

88
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,155
I wouldn't sweat it.

89
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,257
95% get the faction
of their origin,

90
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,658
and from the looks of you...

91
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,898
What is it?

92
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,732
Bottoms up.

93
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,747
Choose.

94
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,484
Now. Before it's too late.

95
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,222
- Why? What will I do with them?
- Choose.

96
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,924
Just tell me.

97
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,164
Puppy!

98
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,122
Get up.

99
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,057
We're going out the back door
before a supervisor comes.

100
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,959
- But what was my result?
- Come on!

101
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,963
What happened?

102
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,165
You're going to tell your family
that the serum made you sick

103
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,867
- and that I sent you home. All right?
- No, but what was my result?

104
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,002
Abnegation.

105
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,139
And Erudite. And Dauntless.

106
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,210
Dauntless...

107
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,312
Your results were inconclusive.

108
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,247
That's impossible. It
doesn't make any sense.

109
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:59,583
No. Not impossible. It's
just extremely rare.

110
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,387
They call it "Divergent."

111
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,892
You can't tell anyone about
this. Not even your parents.

112
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,261
As far as the world is concerned,

113
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:12,598
you received an Abnegation result because
that is what I manually entered.

114
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,434
So what am I supposed to do
at the choosing ceremony?

115
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,970
I was supposed to learn what to do.

116
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:19,572
This was supposed to tell me what
faction to choose, the test.

117
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:24,241
- We're supposed to trust the test.
- The test didn't work on you.

118
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,279
You have to trust yourself.

119
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,596
What happened to you today?

120
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,932
Where did you go after your test?

121
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,568
I got sick, so they
sent me home early.

122
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,370
Did you finish your test?

123
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,136
Mmm-hmm.

124
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,374
What was your result?

125
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,179
What was yours?

126
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,184
Why did you just leave
without telling anybody?

127
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,151
I was sick.

128
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,956
Beatrice...

129
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,992
I don't think you understand the
level of scrutiny we're under.

130
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:50,374
They're doing everything they
can to discredit us right now.

131
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,664
Who is?

132
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,933
Erudite.

133
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,669
They believe that they should be
the governing faction, not us.

134
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,604
So you have to be careful
right now, okay?

135
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,639
Even Marcus is under attack.

136
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,339
For what?

137
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,810
It's an old accusation.

138
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,014
That he mistreated his son

139
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,516
and that's why the boy defected.

140
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,252
- Is that true?
- No.

141
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,054
'Course not.

142
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,755
Children defect for
all kinds of reasons.

143
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:29,033
Don't take too long in here. You
need a good night's sleep...

144
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,669
For tomorrow.

145
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,807
I, um...

146
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,347
We love you.

147
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,161
Good night.

148
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,532
I'm so proud of you, honey.

149
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,457
- Beatrice?
- What?

150
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,314
Tomorrow when we choose...

151
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,120
You have to think of the family.

152
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,521
Yeah.

153
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:26,356
But you also have to
think of yourself.

154
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,403
<i>Factions, please gather
in your assigned areas.</i>

155
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,447
Morning, Jeanine.

156
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:24,850
Good morning, Andrew.
How is Marcus holding up?

157
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,252
As well as can be expected.

158
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,721
We need to find out who's
behind these rumors.

159
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:33,192
I think we all know who it is.

160
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:37,429
If it's someone from Erudite,
I promise I'll find out who.

161
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,332
These are your children. I don't think
I knew they were choosing today.

162
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,367
- What's your name?
- I'm... I'm Caleb.

163
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,703
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Jeanine Matthews.

164
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,672
And you are?

165
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,806
This is Beatrice.

166
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,811
Well, you both have a big
decision to make today.

167
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:55,647
I'm sure your parents will support
whatever choice you make.

168
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,415
That's not supposed to be a choice.

169
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,026
The test should tell us what to do.

170
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,290
- You're still free to choose.
- But you don't really want that.

171
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,224
Beatrice...

172
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:14,199
I want you to choose who you truly
are and where you truly belong.

173
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,536
Not on a whim. Not because you
wish you were someone you're not.

174
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,839
But because you
honestly know yourself.

175
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:26,109
I want you to choose wisely.
And I know you will.

176
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,586
The faction system
is a living being

177
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:38,690
composed of cells, all of you.

178
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,326
And the only way it can
survive and thrive

179
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:45,597
is for each of you to claim
your rightful place.

180
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:50,634
The future belongs to those
who know where they belong.

181
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,276
When we leave this room,

182
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,778
you will no longer be dependents

183
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:03,179
but full-fledged members
of our society.

184
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,949
Faction before blood.

185
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,485
Faction before blood.

186
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,057
I love you...

187
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,526
No matter what.

188
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,597
Jonathan Ziegler.

189
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,001
Erudite.

190
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,585
Jeffrey Yates.

191
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,015
Dauntless.

192
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,292
Morgan Stokes.

193
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,496
Amity.

194
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,939
Claire Satron. Candor.

195
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,408
Sam Robertson. Abnegation.

196
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,477
Caleb Prior.

197
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,967
Erudite.

198
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,760
Quiet, please.

199
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,249
Beatrice Prior.

200
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,410
Dauntless.

201
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,223
Welcome to Dauntless!

202
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,926
Come on! Let's go!

203
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,849
Come on!

204
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,494
Sorry.

205
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,729
You made it.

206
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,546
- I'm Christina.
- Beatrice.

207
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,672
Is it just me or are
they trying to kill us?

208
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,420
Get ready!

209
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,507
Yeah!

210
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:07,684
- They're jumping.
- What?

211
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,283
What if you don't jump?

212
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:14,384
What do you think?
You'll be factionless.

213
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,386
Good luck, Al.

214
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,555
Whoa!

215
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,944
- Together?
- Yeah.

216
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,768
One, two, three...

217
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,318
All right, listen up!

218
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,591
I'm Eric. I'm one of your leaders.

219
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:54,826
If you want to enter
Dauntless, this is the way in.

220
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,761
And if you don't have
the guts to jump,

221
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,830
then you don't belong in Dauntless.

222
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,799
Is there water at the
bottom or something?

223
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,699
I guess you'll find out.

224
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,604
Or not.

225
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:07,973
We just jumped. They
want us to jump again?

226
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,634
Someone's gotta go first.
Who's it gonna be?

227
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,419
Me.

228
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:48,445
Yeah, stiff, take it off!

229
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,547
Put it back on!

230
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:16,039
Today, Initiate.

231
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:50,842
What, you get pushed?

232
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,542
No.

233
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,381
What's your name?

234
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:58,415
It's...

235
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,186
Is that a hard one?

236
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:03,388
You can pick a new one if
you want, but make it good.

237
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,622
You don't get to pick again.

238
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:10,794
Okay... My name's Tris.

239
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,466
First jumper, Tris!

240
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:17,287
Welcome to Dauntless.

241
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,152
Dauntless-born, go with Lauren,
transfers stay with me.

242
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,221
Go.

243
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:37,987
This way.

244
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,359
Most of the time I
work in Intelligence,

245
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,761
but during your training,
I'll be your instructor.

246
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,798
My name's Four.

247
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,731
Four like the number?

248
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:50,802
Exactly like the number.

249
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:53,670
What happened, one through
three were taken?

250
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,377
What's your name?

251
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:01,144
Christina.

252
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,453
Well, Christina.

253
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:10,955
The first lesson you learn from me

254
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:12,557
if you wanna survive here,

255
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:14,791
is keep your mouth shut.

256
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,095
Do you understand me?

257
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:18,962
Yes.

258
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,198
Good.

259
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:25,802
Follow me.

260
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:09,280
This is The Pit.

261
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,180
The center of life
here at Dauntless.

262
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,683
You're gonna be sleeping
here for the next 10 weeks.

263
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,699
Girls or boys?

264
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,402
Both.

265
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,371
- Nice.
- That works.

266
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,440
If you like this, you're
gonna love the bathroom.

267
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,141
Great.

268
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:41,613
Okay...

269
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,381
- Seriously?
- Is there no other area?

270
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:46,551
Are you kidding?

271
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:48,052
You should feel right
at home, Candor.

272
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,954
Everything out in the open.

273
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,556
Is this a joke?

274
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:53,356
Get changed.

275
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,660
Right. Shower, anyone?

276
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,300
Nice legs, stiff.

277
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,845
- Hey.
- How you doin'?

278
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,876
Shall we sit there?

279
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,300
Have you never seen
a hamburger before?

280
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:12,370
No, I've seen one. I just
have never eaten one.

281
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,272
Abnegation eat plain food.

282
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:17,542
Plant-based diet with no sauces
and a minimum of seasoning.

283
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,278
Which textbook did you swallow?

284
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,813
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm Will. Erudite.

285
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,250
Of course you are.

286
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,619
No offense, but I'm surprised
Abnegation even eats at all.

287
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,489
Too selfish, right?
No wonder you left.

288
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,524
You gotta be pretty self-confident
to be friends with a Candor.

289
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:34,726
What is that supposed to mean?

290
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:38,062
You have no filter. You say the first
thing that comes into your head.

291
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,465
You mean like, "You're an idiot"?

292
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:42,700
Nice one, Al. At least
we tell the truth.

293
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,136
Erudite can tell the truth
because we have the facts.

294
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,917
I don't want to hear
about your old factions.

295
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,275
You're Dauntless now.

296
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:55,411
Were you a transfer, too?
Or Dauntless-born?

297
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,314
Are you kidding?

298
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,416
No.

299
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,260
What makes you think
you can talk to me?

300
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,858
It...

301
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,429
Must be because you're
so approachable.

302
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,739
Careful.

303
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,829
Four...

304
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,846
You, my friend, have a death wish.

305
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,417
You know, he was
first in his class.

306
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:35,787
They tried to recruit him for
leadership twice, but he said no.

307
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:51,100
Initiates, stand.

308
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,310
You have chosen to join
the warrior faction

309
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:03,214
tasked with the defense of this
city and all its inhabitants.

310
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:06,317
We believe in ordinary
acts of bravery

311
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,353
and the courage that
drives one person

312
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,854
to stand up for another.

313
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,090
Respect that.

314
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,392
Do us proud.

315
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,971
Whoa!

316
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,407
I want everyone in The Pit.
Two minutes.

317
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,552
There are two stages of training.

318
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,921
The first is physical.

319
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:18,623
Push your bodies to
the breaking point

320
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:20,224
and you'll master the
methods of combat.

321
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:24,195
The second is mental.
Again, breaking point.

322
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:28,432
You'll face your worst fears and conquer
them unless they get you first.

323
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,434
You'll be trained separately
from the Dauntless-born,

324
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,537
but you'll be ranked together.

325
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:36,774
After initiations, rankings will
determine what jobs you move into.

326
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:41,546
Leadership, guarding the fence, or keeping
the Factionless from killing each other.

327
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:44,408
The rankings will also
determine who gets cut.

328
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,419
Cut?

329
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,423
At the end of each stage of training, the
lowest-ranking Initiates will be leaving us.

330
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,692
To do what?

331
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:58,494
There's no going home to your
families, so you'd live factionless.

332
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:03,234
- Why didn't we know that?
- It's a new rule.

333
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,235
A new rule? Somebody
should have told us that.

334
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:07,705
Why? Would you have
chosen differently?

335
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,508
Out of fear?

336
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:13,945
I mean, if that's the case,
you might as well get out now.

337
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:17,647
If you're really one of us, it won't
matter to you that you might fail.

338
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,549
Now you chose us.

339
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,686
Now we get to choose you.

340
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,680
Statistically speaking, you should have
hit the target at least once by now.

341
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,282
Even by accident.

342
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:01,359
Hey. What have you got?

343
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,762
Factionless. Not doing anything.

344
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:06,897
Check it out, stiff. That's
gonna be your new family.

345
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,969
Go say "Hi."

346
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,412
You ready for some real fighting?

347
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,281
Not even close.

348
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:24,982
First jumper!

349
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,284
In the ring.

350
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,620
Last jumper!

351
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,690
Time to fight.

352
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,367
How long do we fight for?

353
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,303
Till one of you can't continue.

354
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:46,937
Or one of you concedes.

355
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,739
According to the old rules.

356
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,507
New rules, no one concedes.

357
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,612
You really want to lose
'em on their first fight?

358
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,714
A brave man never surrenders.

359
00:36:56,715 --> 00:37:00,384
Lucky for you, those weren't
the rules when we fought.

360
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,886
You'll be scored on
this, so fight hard.

361
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,556
Go!

362
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,711
Don't be scared, stiff!

363
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,823
Nice, Tris!

364
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,684
- Nice.
- Yeah!

365
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,475
All right, guys, over here.

366
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,244
Listen up.

367
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:07,450
Know what this board is?

368
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,120
It's your life.

369
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:12,022
We grade you every day.

370
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:15,858
If you're still in the red by the
end of the first stage, you're out.

371
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,662
<i>I'm never gonna make it.</i>

372
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,531
Yes, you are.

373
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,099
I'm the weakest one here.

374
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,700
Then you'll be most improved.

375
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,538
You're Candor. You're
not supposed to lie.

376
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:31,475
I was Candor. And I'm not lying.

377
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,978
If they cut me, I think my
parents would take me back.

378
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:37,515
No, it doesn't work like that.

379
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:40,418
Even if they wanted to, their
faction wouldn't allow it.

380
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:43,385
Even if my parents
would take me back,

381
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,755
I wouldn't belong there anymore.

382
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:49,693
- This is getting depressing.
- Yeah.

383
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:52,829
You know what we
should do? Get tattoos.

384
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,823
Did you know they had a
tattoo of your face?

385
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:03,774
- Like it?
- Yeah.

386
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,476
- Where would you get it?
- I don't know.

387
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,678
Where do you suggest?

388
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,980
Anywhere you want.

389
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:13,549
Here, it's this thing here.

390
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,401
You remember me, right?

391
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,238
- I was just wondering if you could...
- No.

392
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,874
I just do tattoos.

393
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,380
Okay.

394
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,759
I'd like this one.

395
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,928
Please.

396
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,771
Can I just ask you...

397
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,808
You made a mistake
choosing Dauntless.

398
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,549
- They'll find out about you...
- Who?

399
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,246
Who will?

400
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,647
The people you're a threat to.

401
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:20,084
- What people? Who, Dauntless?
- No, society.

402
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,466
If you don't fit into a category,
they can't control you.

403
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,223
I don't get it.

404
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:30,259
I'm Dauntless. I'm going to be
Dauntless. I chose Dauntless.

405
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:35,531
For your sake, I hope so.

406
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:46,935
You're weak. You have no muscle.

407
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,846
- You're never gonna win, not like that.
- That's good to know.

408
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:56,714
Yeah, you're gonna have
to use your whole body.

409
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:58,814
Keep tension here.

410
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,787
- Okay...
- And go on offense.

411
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:07,356
You're fast, so you could
win if you attack first.

412
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,538
You get inside, you
jab to the throat.

413
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:12,963
Four!

414
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:15,464
Keep working.

415
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:25,009
Sorry about that, Will.

416
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,451
Come on, Chris.

417
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,728
Stop... Stop!

418
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,765
I'm done. I'm done.

419
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:49,465
You need to stop?

420
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,135
Okay.

421
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,071
Let me give you a hand.

422
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,815
Thanks.

423
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:07,196
All right, let's
everyone take a break!

424
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:17,361
You feelin' a little better?

425
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:19,129
Yeah, I'm fine.

426
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:21,964
Whoa!

427
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,103
Grab the rail.

428
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,484
Or don't.

429
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,809
You've got three options.

430
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,044
Hang there and I'll
forget your cowardice.

431
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:35,179
Fall and die.

432
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:38,447
Or give up.

433
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,529
But if you give up, you're out.

434
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,061
Come on, Chris!

435
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,078
Time!

436
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,455
Dauntless never give up.

437
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:31,967
As Dauntless, we fight to protect every
life inside the fence, without fail.

438
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:35,537
That's why we train
you the way we do.

439
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,474
To teach you not to give up.

440
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,945
And to find out who
has what it takes.

441
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:51,155
<i>Even though it's been quiet out there for
years, that could change at any moment.</i>

442
00:44:51,156 --> 00:44:53,023
<i>So we have to be ready
for everything.</i>

443
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,790
Whoo!

444
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,475
What's out there?

445
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:13,544
Monsters.

446
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:15,245
Amity farms.

447
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:17,080
No, I know. But beyond that?

448
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:20,048
Places that never
recovered from the war.

449
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:21,185
Do you know?

450
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:24,127
Let's just say they built
their fence for a reason.

451
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,704
Man!

452
00:45:52,115 --> 00:45:53,217
You're kinda good at this.

453
00:45:53,218 --> 00:45:55,150
Come on.

454
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,860
That was pathetic.

455
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,997
It slipped.

456
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:08,697
Well, go get it!

457
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,338
What, while they're throwing?

458
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:16,206
Are you afraid?

459
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:18,208
Of getting stabbed by an
airborne knife? Yeah.

460
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:20,208
Everybody stop.

461
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,281
Stand in front of the target.

462
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,962
Four, gimme a hand here.

463
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:42,764
You're gonna stand there while
he throws those knives.

464
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:47,636
And if I see you
flinch, you're out.

465
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,407
One thing you will learn here

466
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:53,775
is that orders are not optional.

467
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,093
Stop.

468
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:18,302
Anyone can stand in front of a target.
It doesn't prove anything.

469
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:21,164
Then it should be easy for
you to take his place.

470
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,782
Same rules apply.

471
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,959
Oh, come on, Four.

472
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,309
You can get closer than that.

473
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:03,191
- You want me to give her a little trim?
- Yeah, maybe just a little off the top.

474
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,463
Points for bravery, stiff.

475
00:48:19,464 --> 00:48:22,898
Not as many as you just lost
for opening your mouth.

476
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:28,236
Now watch yourself.

477
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,873
We train soldiers, not rebels.

478
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:35,911
But we're done for today. Get out.

479
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,253
- You all right?
- You cut me.

480
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,287
I meant to.

481
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,758
You meant to?

482
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:50,394
You think he was gonna let
you off without a scratch?

483
00:48:50,395 --> 00:48:54,698
You'd still be standing
there if I hadn't hit you.

484
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:57,365
So am I supposed to thank you?

485
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:02,372
You're supposed to be smart.

486
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:05,907
If I wanted to hurt
you, I would have.

487
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:18,220
There she is.

488
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,193
You do have a death wish.

489
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:25,395
I can't believe you
said that to Eric.

490
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:27,097
You're the only one who's
ever stood up to him.

491
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:29,132
Look at your ear. Let's
get you cleaned up.

492
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:33,303
Hey, Tris. That was cool.

493
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,270
Thanks.

494
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:41,611
Impressive, stiff. Congrats.

495
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:42,646
Shut up.

496
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:46,783
What? Hey, you're famous now. I mean,
not because of the thing with Eric.

497
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:49,252
You're in the news. Yeah, listen.

498
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:52,689
"The recent transfers of
Beatrice and Caleb Prior,

499
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,760
"children of Andrew Prior, call
into question the soundness

500
00:49:56,761 --> 00:49:59,394
"of Abnegation's
teachings and values.

501
00:49:59,729 --> 00:50:02,365
"What prompted them to leave?

502
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:06,369
"Perhaps the answer lies in the
corrupted ideal of an entire faction.

503
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,172
"The theft of resources,
the general incompetence,

504
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,108
"the abuse of their children."

505
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:13,809
Did they beat you,
like Marcus Eaton's kid?

506
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:18,248
They didn't beat anyone.
They're good people.

507
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:21,349
Right. And that's why you left?

508
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,458
Was it something I said?

509
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:29,860
- He's an idiot.
- Yeah.

510
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:32,294
Yeah. That's okay.

511
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:40,437
What's she doing at Dauntless?

512
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,543
Prior.

513
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,477
You're Andrew Prior's
daughter, aren't you?

514
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:51,448
Beatrice.

515
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:53,884
It's just Tris now.

516
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:56,184
Tris, I like that.

517
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,557
Hmm.

518
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,627
You made an impressive choice,
Tris, despite your parents.

519
00:51:03,628 --> 00:51:05,994
And your test result.

520
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:07,831
You've seen my test result?

521
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:10,667
Of course.

522
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:13,529
I'm glad you were smart
enough to know your own mind.

523
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:18,473
Let me know if you
ever need anything.

524
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,884
Well, that was weird.

525
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,886
Yeah.

526
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,491
What do you think is goin' on?

527
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:37,561
I bet they're hunting Divergents.

528
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:40,562
That's all they talk about
at Erudite these days.

529
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,334
Wait. Divergents are real?

530
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:46,715
Come on, Al.

531
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:57,045
First fight. Peter versus Tris.

532
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:59,349
What?

533
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,049
Uh-oh.

534
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:03,954
It's Eric.

535
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:06,588
He's just trying to
get back at you.

536
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,761
- Hey.
- What?

537
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:15,465
Remember what I said about attack?

538
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,500
First shot, right to the throat.

539
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,002
And you watch him.

540
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:21,538
He steps before he punches.

541
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:22,606
All right?

542
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,372
Mmm.

543
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,749
All right there, stiff?

544
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,452
Look like you're about to cry.

545
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:36,953
Might take it easy
on you if you cry.

546
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:39,688
Come on, Tris.

547
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,048
Get up. Get up.

548
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:06,916
Come on. Stop playin'
with each other.

549
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:54,364
Wow. You look...

550
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:56,064
Look bad.

551
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,371
How long have I been here?

552
00:54:01,372 --> 00:54:02,505
About a day.

553
00:54:02,506 --> 00:54:04,674
A day?

554
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:07,809
Have you seen the
scoreboard? Where am I?

555
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,259
You got below the line.

556
00:54:12,982 --> 00:54:15,683
Why are you wearing those vests?

557
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,087
War games.

558
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:20,957
Whoa. What are you doing?

559
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:22,492
- I'm coming.
- You can't.

560
00:54:22,493 --> 00:54:24,127
Eric says you're done.

561
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:25,662
What?

562
00:54:25,663 --> 00:54:27,595
He said you're out.

563
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,967
Your father's on the council, Tris.

564
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:34,389
Maybe they'll make an exception
and let you go home.

565
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:37,272
We're sorry, Tris.

566
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:40,567
We gotta go. We're
gonna miss the train.

567
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:42,710
Yeah, okay.

568
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:49,986
- Bye.
- Bye.

569
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:52,528
- Bye.
- Bye.

570
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:37,432
Thanks.

571
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:45,742
Hi.

572
00:55:45,743 --> 00:55:47,110
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

573
00:55:47,111 --> 00:55:49,712
I just figured that
I had to make it.

574
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,646
Who let you out?

575
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,184
I did.

576
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:56,251
You did?

577
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,459
Okay.

578
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,708
Let's sit you down.

579
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:21,576
The game's simple.
It's like Capture the Flag.

580
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,812
Weapon of choice.

581
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,182
You call that a gun?

582
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,895
Neuro-stim dart.

583
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:41,531
Simulates the pain of
a real gunshot wound.

584
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:43,566
Only lasts a couple minutes.

585
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:46,002
Two teams. Four and I are captains.

586
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:47,837
You pick first.

587
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:50,772
Okay. Edward.

588
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,043
I'll take the stiff.

589
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:55,879
Oh. Picking the weak ones

590
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,660
so you've got someone
to blame when you lose.

591
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,949
Something like that.

592
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,661
Where did Eric's team go?

593
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:14,282
They must have gone to the end.

594
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,102
All right. Lights off.

595
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,884
Gather around. Come on.

596
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:23,072
Okay. What's your strategy?

597
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:25,542
We can hide the flag well
enough so they can't find it.

598
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:27,210
Let's send out a team to scout their
location. See if we can find their flag.

599
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:28,845
I say we blitz them. Just...

600
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:30,046
Yeah, that's the best
way to lose quickly.

601
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:31,548
Let's make them come to us.

602
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:32,815
End this quickly,
they won't expect it.

603
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:34,684
We don't know where they are.

604
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:35,685
Okay, we split into two
groups, defense and offense.

605
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:38,321
- Who put you in charge?
- Someone has to make a decision.

606
00:57:38,322 --> 00:57:40,842
- We need to be more aggressive.
- We need to be smart about it.

607
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,136
You're not gonna jump, are you?

608
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:56,704
No, I'm just trying to get
a good vantage point.

609
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,041
Good thinking.

610
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,047
You don't have to come with me.

611
00:58:04,048 --> 00:58:06,115
You should go easy.
You took a beating.

612
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:08,084
I'm surprised you noticed.

613
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,752
I saw you leave during the fight.

614
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:12,453
Yeah, well, it's not
something I wanted to watch.

615
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:22,463
Hey!

616
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:30,838
You good?

617
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,676
You okay?

618
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,710
Yeah. I'm fine.

619
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:42,817
This is high enough.

620
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,953
No, we need to go higher.

621
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,959
You all right?

622
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:57,066
You're afraid of heights.

623
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,901
Everyone's afraid of something.

624
00:59:00,903 --> 00:59:03,603
I didn't think you were
afraid of anything.

625
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:14,917
Come on, Tris.

626
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,888
Really?

627
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,127
Are you even human?

628
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,811
This isn't so bad.

629
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,850
Good eye.

630
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:53,456
Look!

631
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:55,837
There it is.

632
00:59:56,826 --> 01:00:00,029
- All right. What's your plan?
- We split into two groups.

633
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:03,570
We'll go up this side and let
the rest of you engage Eric.

634
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,695
- I can see 'em.
- Go! Go!

635
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:17,980
Light 'em up!

636
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,852
There's two more! I'm
gonna move in closer!

637
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:24,220
Follow me. Go!

638
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:30,164
- Watch on your right!
- Go, go, go.

639
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,928
Go.

640
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:32,962
Christina, let's go!

641
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,996
Get 'em, get 'em!

642
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:41,871
This way!

643
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:44,005
- Cover me!
- All right.

644
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:53,082
Tell me if this hurts.

645
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:55,051
You tell me.

646
01:00:55,052 --> 01:00:57,218
You bitch!

647
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:00,747
Asshole.

648
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:04,092
That was awesome!

649
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:06,994
Get covered!

650
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,690
Go, Tris! I'll guard.

651
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,980
Whoo!

652
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,088
Game over!

653
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:08,256
Good job, Tris!

654
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:14,397
Hey, Tris!

655
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:15,531
Yeah?

656
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:16,966
Come with us.

657
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:18,267
Where you going?

658
01:02:18,268 --> 01:02:19,869
Shortcut back.

659
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:24,006
A little initiation ritual,
Dauntless style.

660
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:49,931
Wow.

661
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,383
All right, let's do this!

662
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:08,584
- Good.
- All right, you good?

663
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:10,086
- Hang tight.
- Yeah. Go, go!

664
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:12,507
- Fly, baby.
- Whoo!

665
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:16,924
You're up.

666
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,961
All right, do it!

667
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:23,104
Come on, girl.

668
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,201
Go for it! Do it, Tris!

669
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,138
Like flying!

670
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:34,343
Don't forget to pull the
brake at the bottom!

671
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:36,043
Okay.

672
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,915
Go.

673
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:39,982
You ready?

674
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,217
Harness is good.

675
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:45,186
Pull the brake! Pull the brake!

676
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:07,768
Yeah!

677
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,313
Tris!

678
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,489
- Hey.
- Hey.

679
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,256
Congratulations.

680
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,128
Thanks.

681
01:05:32,129 --> 01:05:35,164
You know, I wanted to say that
you were really good tonight.

682
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:37,398
You were brave.

683
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:41,202
Yeah.

684
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:46,232
Anyway, you should get
back to your friends.

685
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:49,844
Okay.

686
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:03,392
If you're ranked
above the red line,

687
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:05,728
you'll move on to the
second stage of training.

688
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:07,430
If you're below it,

689
01:06:07,431 --> 01:06:09,932
we'll waste no more time on you.

690
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:13,167
Here are your rankings.

691
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,757
Nice.

692
01:06:25,347 --> 01:06:26,549
You made it.

693
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,450
You made it, Tris.

694
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:36,596
- Got it.
- Thank you.

695
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:53,476
Here you go.

696
01:06:53,477 --> 01:06:56,378
So we pass the first stage of
training, and this is our reward.

697
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,446
Toss it up!

698
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,346
Glamorous.

699
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:42,791
Mom?

700
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:48,429
Oh, my girl!

701
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:52,220
- Mom, what are you doing here?
- I knew they'd assign you here...

702
01:07:52,246 --> 01:07:56,416
sooner or later. Look at you! God,
you're so strong and beautiful.

703
01:07:57,573 --> 01:08:00,876
- Mom, you can't be here.
- I know, but you're in danger.

704
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:01,610
What?

705
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:04,180
I had to ask you something.

706
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:07,448
You weren't sick the day you took
your aptitude test, were you?

707
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:10,452
- Why?
- What were your test results?

708
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:14,174
Honey, it's okay. You can tell me.

709
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:22,062
They were... They
were inconclusive.

710
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,467
Divergent?

711
01:08:25,368 --> 01:08:28,066
You can't tell anyone. You can't
tell your friends, your instructors.

712
01:08:28,067 --> 01:08:29,271
You can't trust anyone.

713
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,973
I'm not.

714
01:08:30,974 --> 01:08:34,310
People have always been
so threatened by Divergents.

715
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:35,744
But now Erudite is looking
for them everywhere.

716
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:38,314
- They're actively seeking them out.
- Why?

717
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:40,969
- Mom, what am I?
- You don't conform.

718
01:08:40,995 --> 01:08:45,354
Your mind works in a million different
ways. They're scared of you.

719
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:48,390
Stage two of training is
where you are most at risk.

720
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:51,493
They're gonna get inside your head
and watch how you respond to fear.

721
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:55,497
But you can pass. You can make it
through Dauntless. I have seen it before.

722
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:58,000
How do you know so much
about this? About Dauntless?

723
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:00,603
Never mind about me. Do not
let them know who you are.

724
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:02,338
Wait! Wait! Were you Dauntless?

725
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:04,799
- Listen.
- Hey!

726
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,942
What are you doing?

727
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:14,481
Truck's loaded. Let's go.

728
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,670
What did they do to her?

729
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,540
Tris.

730
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:52,753
Take a seat.

731
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,761
I'm going to inject you with
a serum that stimulates

732
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:00,829
the part of your brain
that processes fear.

733
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,631
Great.

734
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:04,833
It induces a hallucination,

735
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:07,903
and then transmitters in the serum allow
me to see the images in your mind.

736
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:11,672
- You can see inside my mind?
- Mmm-hmm.

737
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:17,144
Lay back.

738
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:37,433
Now, you're gonna be facing
your worst fears, Tris.

739
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:40,667
Most people have 10 to
15 really bad ones.

740
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,472
You have to calm yourself.

741
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:47,401
Slow your heart rate and your breathing,
and deal with what's in front of you.

742
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:52,881
Be brave.

743
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,824
This isn't real.

744
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:27,042
It's all right, it's all right.

745
01:12:27,043 --> 01:12:28,610
You okay?

746
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:47,896
How long do you think you were
in the hallucination, Tris?

747
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:50,966
- Twenty minutes?
- Three.

748
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:54,201
Four times faster than the average.

749
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:58,774
I've never seen anyone do
that well the first time.

750
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:00,642
How did you get rid of the birds?

751
01:13:00,643 --> 01:13:02,110
The image wasn't clear.

752
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:03,812
Um...

753
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:06,213
I just went into the water.

754
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:11,253
Well, next time it'll
be a lot easier.

755
01:13:11,254 --> 01:13:13,222
I have to do that again?

756
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:16,091
Yeah, you have to practice several times
before the final, but you're a natural.

757
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:18,692
You got nothing to worry about.

758
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:23,632
My whole body was covered
in these little insects.

759
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:27,033
They were in my ears,
and my throat...

760
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:28,837
I couldn't breathe.

761
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:31,740
Yeah, I heard about this
guy, like two years ago...

762
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:34,480
So panicked he had a heart attack
in his chair and he almost died.

763
01:13:34,481 --> 01:13:35,177
What?

764
01:13:35,178 --> 01:13:37,138
Yeah, so we've got that to
look forward to, right?

765
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:39,915
You didn't seem to have
any problem at all.

766
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:43,519
Me? No, no, my God, it was awful.

767
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,226
Oh, come on. No one even came close
to your time. You were amazing.

768
01:13:46,227 --> 01:13:48,657
Yeah, what's amazing is that she's gonna
knock you right out of Dauntless.

769
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:50,292
She's not gonna knock
me out of Dauntless.

770
01:13:50,293 --> 01:13:52,694
Look, she's gone from being
the worst to one of the best.

771
01:13:52,695 --> 01:13:54,763
Somebody's gotta take her
place at the bottom.

772
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:57,165
Who's it gonna be? You.

773
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,734
Do you ever stop talking?

774
01:13:58,735 --> 01:14:01,535
I just want to know
how she does it.

775
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:02,938
What's your trick?

776
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,706
I don't have a trick.

777
01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:06,041
Nobody gets through it that fast.

778
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:08,702
Why don't you tell
us how you do it?

779
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:12,379
At least tell your friends.

780
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:15,584
What's he talkin' about?

781
01:14:15,585 --> 01:14:18,518
- Is there some way to make it easier?
- No.

782
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:24,825
No, I... I'm not doing anything.

783
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:55,956
Hey! Hey!

784
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:31,558
This isn't real.

785
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:53,847
How'd you do that?

786
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:55,982
What?

787
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,021
How'd you break the glass?

788
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:03,123
I don't know. Just did it.

789
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:05,792
You just did it?

790
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:19,573
What were your test results?

791
01:16:19,941 --> 01:16:22,042
Your aptitude test.

792
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,978
Abnegation.

793
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,948
I don't think so.

794
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,749
What?

795
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:30,911
I think you're lying to me.

796
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:34,788
Why would I lie to you?

797
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:40,427
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

798
01:16:41,329 --> 01:16:43,563
What were your test results?

799
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:47,968
Abnegation.

800
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:52,672
Time for you to go.

801
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,113
Tris?

802
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:02,918
Just so you know,

803
01:17:02,919 --> 01:17:06,186
Dauntless don't break
the glass like that.

804
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:13,762
My brother was like you.

805
01:17:13,763 --> 01:17:16,398
During the second stage,
he got good really fast.

806
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:18,100
Last day of the simulations,

807
01:17:18,101 --> 01:17:21,768
one of the Dauntless
leaders came to watch him.

808
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:26,141
Then the next morning, we found his
body at the bottom of the chasm.

809
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,442
They got rid of him.

810
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:29,945
Who did?

811
01:17:29,946 --> 01:17:31,246
Dauntless leadership.

812
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:33,947
You can't let them
find out about you.

813
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,784
And what if they already know?

814
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:40,120
Then you're already dead.

815
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,222
Beatrice.

816
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:24,566
What are you doing here?

817
01:18:24,567 --> 01:18:26,500
I'm in trouble.

818
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,541
What happened?

819
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:35,002
I'm not gonna make it at Dauntless.

820
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,411
I don't fit in there.

821
01:18:36,412 --> 01:18:37,412
You have to fit in there.

822
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:39,179
I can't.

823
01:18:44,085 --> 01:18:46,555
I'm just... I'm not like them.

824
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:49,789
I mean, who is? They're crazy.

825
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:53,328
Maybe I can go back to Abnegation.

826
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:55,130
You can't go back. I know, but...

827
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:58,166
They're never gonna
let you do that.

828
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:00,135
- Who?
- Erudite.

829
01:19:00,136 --> 01:19:02,256
They're not gonna let Abnegation
break any more rules.

830
01:19:04,574 --> 01:19:06,041
They actually think that they're
running the government now?

831
01:19:06,042 --> 01:19:07,908
They might be soon.

832
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:10,111
Wait. Really?

833
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:12,981
Erudite should be in charge.
Certainly not Abnegation.

834
01:19:12,982 --> 01:19:16,151
Wait, hold on, Caleb.
How can you say that?

835
01:19:16,152 --> 01:19:19,254
It's what all the other factions
want, now that Abnegation failed.

836
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,123
No. That's just what they're
telling you here...

837
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:24,025
- It's true.
- It's not true.

838
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:25,360
It's not.

839
01:19:25,361 --> 01:19:27,028
There are liars here.

840
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:29,097
There are people who know
how to manipulate you.

841
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:30,265
You need to understand that.

842
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:32,265
Beatrice.

843
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:36,336
I think you should go.

844
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:43,209
Faction before blood. Yeah?

845
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:49,849
Got it.

846
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,259
I need you to come with me.

847
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:02,942
Stop!

848
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,599
Are you all right?

849
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:08,368
Yeah, I'm fine.

850
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:25,752
Please, sit down.

851
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,160
Thank you.

852
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:33,995
I'm glad you came here today.

853
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:35,263
You are?

854
01:20:35,264 --> 01:20:37,698
Are you happy with
your new faction?

855
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:39,601
Yeah.

856
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:42,370
But you came to see your brother.

857
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:44,406
I just... I just
wanted to talk to him.

858
01:20:44,407 --> 01:20:47,008
Have you seen your parents?

859
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,708
No.

860
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:54,099
It's hard to let go.

861
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:56,418
Faction before blood.

862
01:20:56,419 --> 01:20:58,219
It's an important ideal,

863
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,121
but sometimes difficult to fulfill.

864
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:03,425
It goes against our
fundamental human nature.

865
01:21:03,426 --> 01:21:05,260
But that's exactly the weakness

866
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:07,629
we need to overcome.

867
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:10,398
You think that human
nature is a weakness?

868
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:14,269
I think human nature is the enemy.

869
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:17,270
It's human nature to keep
secrets, lie, steal.

870
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:19,741
And I wanna eradicate that.

871
01:21:19,742 --> 01:21:24,277
That's how we'll maintain a
stable, peaceful society.

872
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:29,642
You would help me with
that, wouldn't you?

873
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:32,387
How would I help you?

874
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:34,255
You're aware that
Abnegation is undermining

875
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:36,558
the faction system
and breaking laws

876
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:39,292
harboring Divergents?

877
01:21:41,629 --> 01:21:45,266
I didn't know that.

878
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:50,003
But if that's true, then
I'm glad that I left.

879
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:54,275
See, I need to know
that I can count on you

880
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:56,378
to enforce the law,

881
01:21:56,379 --> 01:21:59,114
even if it's been broken
by someone close to you.

882
01:21:59,115 --> 01:22:01,314
Someone you care about.

883
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,451
Of course.

884
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,222
Good.

885
01:22:09,157 --> 01:22:11,937
Then I'll have my car take
you back to Dauntless.

886
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:59,005
Come on! Get her over!

887
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:03,278
Come on, do it! Do it!

888
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:04,646
Hey!

889
01:23:26,634 --> 01:23:28,401
You all right?

890
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,105
Yeah.

891
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:31,806
Come on. Let's go.

892
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:46,252
Here, put this on.

893
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:48,356
Thank you.

894
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,097
You'll be safe here.

895
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:04,572
Sorry.

896
01:24:04,573 --> 01:24:06,339
It's okay.

897
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,415
I can't believe Al...

898
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:18,386
You're moving up through the
ranks, and he's failing.

899
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:22,021
It makes him hate himself
and it makes him hate you.

900
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:24,459
He's just afraid.

901
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,427
Everyone's afraid.

902
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:29,864
I know, but fear does something
strange to people like Al.

903
01:24:29,865 --> 01:24:32,065
But not you.

904
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:36,436
Fear doesn't shut you
down, it wakes you up.

905
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:39,072
I've seen it.

906
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:54,560
You should lie down.

907
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:58,725
- Get some sleep.
- Yeah.

908
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:01,361
I'll take the floor.

909
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:26,454
How you feeling?

910
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:28,356
Better.

911
01:25:28,357 --> 01:25:30,225
Good.

912
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,560
Where'd you go yesterday?

913
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:37,297
To see my brother.

914
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:43,937
It's getting a little
boring for you here, is it?

915
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:47,609
My brother said that...

916
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:51,477
He thinks Erudite is planning
to overthrow Abnegation.

917
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:55,550
Do you think they could do that?

918
01:25:55,551 --> 01:25:58,651
Yeah, I do. I think it's possible.

919
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,100
Depends how far they're
willing to go.

920
01:26:03,891 --> 01:26:06,326
I'm worried about my parents.

921
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,597
Yeah.

922
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:16,369
But I think you got other
things you need to worry about.

923
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,538
Don't you?

924
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:21,541
Yeah.

925
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:28,314
I should go.

926
01:26:40,795 --> 01:26:42,628
Hi.

927
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:44,630
Hey.

928
01:26:44,932 --> 01:26:46,301
Is that your sweater?

929
01:26:46,302 --> 01:26:48,303
No.

930
01:26:48,304 --> 01:26:49,704
So what happened
to you last night?

931
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:51,906
Tris, can I talk to
you for a second?

932
01:26:51,907 --> 01:26:54,642
Listen, I just wanted
to say that I'm sorry.

933
01:26:54,643 --> 01:26:57,345
I don't know what's wrong with me.

934
01:26:57,346 --> 01:26:59,645
Please, can you ever forgive me?

935
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:03,951
If you ever come close to
me again, I will kill you.

936
01:27:03,952 --> 01:27:05,053
Tris...

937
01:27:05,054 --> 01:27:07,689
You need to stay away from me!

938
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:10,123
You are a coward.

939
01:27:22,603 --> 01:27:24,706
I just can't believe
he would do that.

940
01:27:24,707 --> 01:27:27,173
It's not like him at all.

941
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:30,243
What's that?

942
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:33,881
Come on.

943
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:40,153
Oh, my God!

944
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:42,423
Guess he just jumped.

945
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,073
Tris.

946
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:01,609
Tris!

947
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,811
Leave me alone.

948
01:28:03,812 --> 01:28:05,778
I'm sorry about Al.

949
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:08,483
It's my fault that he's dead.

950
01:28:08,484 --> 01:28:11,652
No, it's not because of you.
He made his own choice.

951
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:13,421
He would have been factionless.

952
01:28:13,422 --> 01:28:15,789
He was not gonna pass
that final test.

953
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:17,930
Neither am I.

954
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:23,129
Why do you say that?

955
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:29,836
You know why.

956
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:36,043
And as soon as all the others
find out, they're gonna kill me.

957
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:38,578
I'm not gonna let that happen.

958
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:50,123
Shut the door.

959
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:53,494
You're gonna practice.

960
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:55,463
- In my fear landscape?
- No.

961
01:28:55,464 --> 01:28:57,330
In mine.

962
01:28:57,632 --> 01:28:59,863
We go in together.

963
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:02,494
Have you ever done this before?

964
01:29:03,704 --> 01:29:05,771
No, I haven't.

965
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:10,443
You sure you want to?

966
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:12,745
Why wouldn't I?

967
01:29:14,315 --> 01:29:17,218
I don't know. You haven't told
me anything about yourself

968
01:29:17,219 --> 01:29:19,853
and now you're just gonna
let me inside of your head?

969
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:23,523
- Are you afraid of that?
- You're not?

970
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:26,459
No.

971
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:09,103
Fear of heights.

972
01:30:09,104 --> 01:30:11,470
I'm not surprised.

973
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:17,578
It's not real.

974
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:19,514
No. We could just jump.

975
01:30:19,515 --> 01:30:21,148
Divergent would jump.

976
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:23,184
Dauntless would get
to that building.

977
01:30:23,185 --> 01:30:25,253
If you want to pass, if you
want to avoid discovery,

978
01:30:25,254 --> 01:30:28,289
you have to do everything the
way a Dauntless would do it.

979
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:32,225
You have to find some tool,
some method to survive.

980
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:03,591
Fear of confinement.

981
01:31:03,592 --> 01:31:07,026
You have to find a way of stopping it.
What would a Dauntless do?

982
01:31:07,728 --> 01:31:09,495
Good!

983
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:18,005
Take your time.

984
01:31:18,006 --> 01:31:20,867
I'm just enjoying myself
in this shrinking box.

985
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:40,526
As a Dauntless soldier, you have to follow
orders you don't always agree with.

986
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:44,930
Who is she?

987
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:50,036
She's an innocent.

988
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:54,640
I have to kill her.

989
01:32:01,983 --> 01:32:04,417
But I can never do it.

990
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:07,753
Unless I look away.

991
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,374
Why are we in Abnegation?

992
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:33,045
Your last fear is your worst fear.

993
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:37,650
It lives in the deepest
part of your mind.

994
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:48,127
Marcus had a son.

995
01:32:48,996 --> 01:32:50,031
What was his name?

996
01:32:50,032 --> 01:32:51,966
Tobias.

997
01:32:51,967 --> 01:32:53,999
Tobias.

998
01:32:56,971 --> 01:32:59,071
<i>Tobias...</i>

999
01:33:00,007 --> 01:33:02,475
<i>Tobias...</i>

1000
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:06,781
<i>Tobias...</i>

1001
01:33:06,782 --> 01:33:09,749
I'm just trying to
help you to be better.

1002
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:14,153
No!

1003
01:33:39,213 --> 01:33:41,282
Four?

1004
01:33:41,283 --> 01:33:43,050
Four fears?

1005
01:33:43,051 --> 01:33:45,551
Four then, four now.

1006
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:51,056
I keep going in there, but I
don't think you ever lose them.

1007
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:04,170
Can I ask you something?

1008
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,307
Sure.

1009
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:08,808
What's your tattoo?

1010
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:15,147
You wanna see it?

1011
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:32,164
It's amazing.

1012
01:34:44,078 --> 01:34:46,545
The factions.

1013
01:34:50,217 --> 01:34:53,053
Why do you have all of them?

1014
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:55,688
I don't want to be just one thing.

1015
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:57,923
I can't be.

1016
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:02,897
I want to be brave and
I want to be selfless...

1017
01:35:02,898 --> 01:35:05,631
Intelligent and honest and kind.

1018
01:35:08,068 --> 01:35:11,036
Although I'm still
working on "kind."

1019
01:35:43,204 --> 01:35:45,804
I don't wanna go too fast.

1020
01:35:47,341 --> 01:35:49,241
It's okay.

1021
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:52,613
I've already got my
spot on the floor.

1022
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:13,067
Morning.

1023
01:36:13,068 --> 01:36:14,967
Hey.

1024
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:18,131
Come on. I'm gonna
show you something.

1025
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:21,006
Okay.

1026
01:36:34,588 --> 01:36:36,989
Look.

1027
01:36:41,262 --> 01:36:43,330
- Erudite.
- Yeah.

1028
01:36:43,331 --> 01:36:45,432
They're here every morning.

1029
01:36:45,433 --> 01:36:47,234
I've been watching them for weeks.

1030
01:36:47,235 --> 01:36:49,136
What are they doing at Dauntless?

1031
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:52,304
Loading in supplies. Computers.

1032
01:36:53,173 --> 01:36:55,307
And these.

1033
01:36:57,444 --> 01:36:58,513
What is it?

1034
01:36:58,514 --> 01:37:01,348
I think it's some kind of cognitive
transmitter. You inject it like a serum.

1035
01:37:01,449 --> 01:37:03,250
Why?

1036
01:37:03,251 --> 01:37:06,587
It's supposed to make you more
susceptible to suggestion,

1037
01:37:06,588 --> 01:37:10,823
but as many as they have,
they could create an army.

1038
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:21,568
<i>Attention, all initiates
report for final testing.</i>

1039
01:37:21,569 --> 01:37:24,737
<i>All initiates report
for final testing.</i>

1040
01:37:31,712 --> 01:37:34,081
You're ready.

1041
01:37:34,082 --> 01:37:36,181
You can do this.

1042
01:37:57,438 --> 01:38:00,975
They can see your
hallucinations on the screen.

1043
01:38:00,976 --> 01:38:03,077
So you get past your fears
the way a Dauntless would,

1044
01:38:03,078 --> 01:38:04,645
but do it quickly.

1045
01:38:04,646 --> 01:38:09,416
Right. If I'm too good, then they'll kill
me, and if I'm too slow, then I'll die.

1046
01:38:09,417 --> 01:38:11,151
Right.

1047
01:38:11,152 --> 01:38:13,285
Good luck.

1048
01:38:21,495 --> 01:38:23,228
Good luck, Tris.

1049
01:38:24,298 --> 01:38:25,998
Hope you make it.

1050
01:40:27,588 --> 01:40:29,369
Congratulations.

1051
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:40,532
Whoa. Four!

1052
01:40:42,302 --> 01:40:43,770
Stop! Four!

1053
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:46,371
Aren't you Dauntless?

1054
01:41:05,459 --> 01:41:07,861
Please tell me that you
weren't watching that.

1055
01:41:07,862 --> 01:41:10,403
Would you feel better if I said no?

1056
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,000
You did well.

1057
01:41:15,302 --> 01:41:17,069
Now...

1058
01:41:18,272 --> 01:41:20,372
One final test.

1059
01:41:26,747 --> 01:41:28,881
You know what to do.

1060
01:41:29,183 --> 01:41:31,385
What?

1061
01:41:31,386 --> 01:41:33,187
If you want to be Dauntless.

1062
01:41:33,188 --> 01:41:34,987
No.

1063
01:41:35,289 --> 01:41:37,256
Do it.

1064
01:41:49,938 --> 01:41:52,638
You all right?

1065
01:41:55,642 --> 01:41:57,542
That looked good to me, okay?

1066
01:41:58,345 --> 01:42:00,280
Come on. Let's go.

1067
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:02,516
Congratulations,

1068
01:42:02,517 --> 01:42:03,517
new members of Dauntless.

1069
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:12,492
Dauntless! Dauntless! Dauntless!

1070
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:18,765
Come on. Get in line.

1071
01:42:18,766 --> 01:42:20,701
All right, everybody, line up.

1072
01:42:20,702 --> 01:42:22,236
What's going on?

1073
01:42:22,237 --> 01:42:23,904
<i>All Dauntless initiates,</i>

1074
01:42:23,905 --> 01:42:25,971
<i>report to your command leader.</i>

1075
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,707
All right, listen up!

1076
01:42:29,843 --> 01:42:32,779
Before you leave tonight,
I want you all in four lines.

1077
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:35,449
Everyone gets a tracking device.

1078
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:38,617
Don't ask questions.
It's just a precaution.

1079
01:42:50,597 --> 01:42:52,564
Do you see Four?

1080
01:42:53,734 --> 01:42:54,835
No.

1081
01:42:54,836 --> 01:42:56,270
Next!

1082
01:42:56,271 --> 01:42:59,051
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God.

1083
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:01,540
Congratulations.

1084
01:43:02,309 --> 01:43:04,745
You should be first in line, but...

1085
01:43:04,746 --> 01:43:06,645
I'll make it easy for you.

1086
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:12,617
Hurts like a bitch, huh?

1087
01:43:12,919 --> 01:43:15,387
Now you're really one of us.

1088
01:43:34,975 --> 01:43:37,342
Hey, what's...

1089
01:43:51,091 --> 01:43:52,826
<i>Faction before blood.</i>

1090
01:43:52,827 --> 01:43:54,693
Oh, my God.

1091
01:44:10,444 --> 01:44:11,778
They can see and hear us.

1092
01:44:11,779 --> 01:44:14,114
They just don't process
it the same way.

1093
01:44:14,115 --> 01:44:17,649
Commands come in through
the transmitter.

1094
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:27,459
What's goin' on?

1095
01:44:28,829 --> 01:44:31,296
What are we doin'?

1096
01:44:34,868 --> 01:44:37,402
Divergent.

1097
01:44:41,141 --> 01:44:44,711
Hey! Everything's fine.
There's nothing to worry about.

1098
01:47:15,795 --> 01:47:17,731
Hurry up! Move!

1099
01:47:21,869 --> 01:47:24,170
<i>Abnegation leaders must
identify themselves.</i>

1100
01:47:24,171 --> 01:47:25,972
We need to find my parents.

1101
01:47:30,912 --> 01:47:33,647
Just keep moving.
Where's your house?

1102
01:47:33,648 --> 01:47:36,016
<i>We are looking for information.</i>

1103
01:47:36,017 --> 01:47:38,618
<i>All houses will be searched.</i>

1104
01:47:38,619 --> 01:47:41,386
<i>Do not resist. You
will not be hurt.</i>

1105
01:47:48,028 --> 01:47:50,328
Mom? Dad?

1106
01:47:51,865 --> 01:47:53,999
Where would they have gone?

1107
01:47:54,901 --> 01:47:56,901
I don't know.

1108
01:47:59,706 --> 01:48:02,974
This can't happen
here! Just stop it!

1109
01:48:08,848 --> 01:48:10,815
<i>Do not resist.</i>

1110
01:48:14,621 --> 01:48:16,923
<i>All Abnegation will be questioned.</i>

1111
01:48:16,924 --> 01:48:21,261
The legendary Four...
A mindless drone.

1112
01:48:21,262 --> 01:48:24,295
You were first in your
class. Now you're...

1113
01:48:24,698 --> 01:48:26,831
Nothing.

1114
01:48:41,681 --> 01:48:43,783
What?

1115
01:48:43,784 --> 01:48:45,817
Think he might be...

1116
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,554
There's one way to find out.

1117
01:48:50,890 --> 01:48:53,026
- Say goodbye, asshole.
- Goodbye.

1118
01:48:53,027 --> 01:48:54,893
Move and you die!

1119
01:48:55,295 --> 01:48:56,930
The stiff?

1120
01:48:59,633 --> 01:49:01,368
Two stiffs.

1121
01:49:01,369 --> 01:49:03,136
Two dead stiffs.

1122
01:49:03,137 --> 01:49:06,106
You can't let a single
Divergent slip through.

1123
01:49:06,107 --> 01:49:09,843
- This is what happens.
- She's not gonna shoot me.

1124
01:49:09,844 --> 01:49:12,211
Think you might be
overestimating my character.

1125
01:49:14,881 --> 01:49:16,282
Run!

1126
01:49:22,422 --> 01:49:24,882
- You were hit?
- Yeah.

1127
01:49:25,025 --> 01:49:27,193
Right there! Don't move!

1128
01:49:27,194 --> 01:49:28,975
Drop your weapons.

1129
01:49:49,115 --> 01:49:51,716
Tobias Eaton.

1130
01:49:53,186 --> 01:49:56,087
And you, Beatrice.

1131
01:49:57,323 --> 01:49:59,959
I thought it was intellect
I was sensing in you.

1132
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:02,740
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

1133
01:50:02,862 --> 01:50:04,998
Why are you attacking all
these innocent people?

1134
01:50:04,999 --> 01:50:06,866
Innocent people?

1135
01:50:06,867 --> 01:50:10,837
Abnegation, if left unchecked,
will destroy the faction system.

1136
01:50:10,838 --> 01:50:13,440
Same can be said of both of you.

1137
01:50:13,441 --> 01:50:17,477
Somebody has to stop you.
If we don't, peace will be lost.

1138
01:50:17,478 --> 01:50:20,313
It's already been lost.
You destroyed it.

1139
01:50:20,314 --> 01:50:23,349
Human nature destroyed it.

1140
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:28,488
Those of us with the vision to see that
are called upon to protect the rest.

1141
01:50:28,489 --> 01:50:33,460
We will restore the peace.
And this time, it will last.

1142
01:50:33,461 --> 01:50:35,794
And what if you're wrong?

1143
01:50:42,335 --> 01:50:44,769
Bring him with us.

1144
01:50:47,874 --> 01:50:52,577
She's injured. Any results
would be unclear.

1145
01:50:53,413 --> 01:50:56,354
- You can get rid of her.
- All right.

1146
01:51:00,987 --> 01:51:03,087
Get down!

1147
01:51:08,762 --> 01:51:11,063
Let's go. Come on!

1148
01:51:15,802 --> 01:51:19,871
<i>Additional security teams, report
to mobile command Level 5.</i>

1149
01:51:57,110 --> 01:51:59,177
Beatrice!

1150
01:51:59,479 --> 01:52:01,813
- Mom? Mom!
- Beatrice.

1151
01:52:02,115 --> 01:52:04,115
Okay.

1152
01:52:09,389 --> 01:52:11,756
Okay, we gotta run!

1153
01:52:22,502 --> 01:52:25,003
You were Dauntless.

1154
01:52:25,305 --> 01:52:27,305
Served me well today.

1155
01:52:28,174 --> 01:52:29,876
Is Dad okay?

1156
01:52:29,877 --> 01:52:33,179
Yeah. He led a group over to Monroe
and State. We're gonna meet him there.

1157
01:52:35,448 --> 01:52:37,181
Let's go!

1158
01:52:51,164 --> 01:52:53,131
Copy 1-9!

1159
01:53:11,618 --> 01:53:13,952
Will! Will!

1160
01:53:17,657 --> 01:53:20,792
Will! Will, stop! Stop!

1161
01:53:21,361 --> 01:53:25,498
Stop!

1162
01:53:25,499 --> 01:53:27,365
I...

1163
01:53:34,908 --> 01:53:38,242
Okay. Come on, honey. We gotta go.

1164
01:53:53,126 --> 01:53:58,197
I killed him. I killed
him. I killed him.

1165
01:53:58,198 --> 01:53:59,931
Come here.

1166
01:54:04,570 --> 01:54:06,638
Okay.

1167
01:54:07,206 --> 01:54:09,407
Let's go find your father.

1168
01:54:12,312 --> 01:54:14,413
- Cover me.
- No.

1169
01:54:14,414 --> 01:54:16,781
I'll go.

1170
01:54:22,455 --> 01:54:24,656
Got it, sir!

1171
01:54:27,962 --> 01:54:29,995
Don't stop! Don't stop!

1172
01:54:29,996 --> 01:54:31,531
Go!

1173
01:54:36,569 --> 01:54:39,110
- You okay?
- Yeah, good. I'm good.

1174
01:54:44,577 --> 01:54:47,278
Okay! Let's go! We're good.

1175
01:54:48,114 --> 01:54:49,248
Mom?

1176
01:54:49,249 --> 01:54:51,349
Mom... What is it?

1177
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:54,986
Hey...

1178
01:54:55,288 --> 01:54:57,991
Mom! Mom! Mom!

1179
01:54:57,992 --> 01:55:01,160
Mom! Mom, no!

1180
01:55:01,161 --> 01:55:03,995
Mom! Mom!

1181
01:55:05,098 --> 01:55:09,367
Mom? Mom! Mom, wake up!

1182
01:55:10,136 --> 01:55:12,036
Mom!

1183
01:55:12,438 --> 01:55:15,073
Oh, my God, Mom!

1184
01:55:21,781 --> 01:55:23,649
Stop! Stop!

1185
01:55:28,121 --> 01:55:30,955
I love you, Mom...

1186
01:55:34,527 --> 01:55:36,761
Oh, my God!

1187
01:56:33,286 --> 01:56:35,188
Where's my father?

1188
01:56:35,189 --> 01:56:36,856
Beatrice?

1189
01:56:43,629 --> 01:56:45,496
Your mother?

1190
01:57:05,852 --> 01:57:08,486
She saved me.

1191
01:57:09,122 --> 01:57:11,422
She saved me.

1192
01:57:11,757 --> 01:57:14,292
Then it wasn't in vain.

1193
01:57:15,795 --> 01:57:17,862
We need to leave here.

1194
01:57:18,898 --> 01:57:21,299
Are there soldiers outside?

1195
01:57:25,505 --> 01:57:27,572
No, it's clear.

1196
01:57:28,741 --> 01:57:30,843
I should have believed you.

1197
01:57:30,844 --> 01:57:33,713
I left as soon as I realized.

1198
01:57:33,714 --> 01:57:36,547
Why is this happening?
I don't understand.

1199
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:39,852
Why are Dauntless
fighting for Erudite?

1200
01:57:39,853 --> 01:57:41,320
They don't know what they're doing.

1201
01:57:41,321 --> 01:57:44,390
They're under simulation.

1202
01:57:44,391 --> 01:57:46,759
We need to wake 'em up.
I need to get into Dauntless.

1203
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:48,620
That's a fortress.

1204
01:57:48,861 --> 01:57:50,862
It's not gonna happen.

1205
01:57:52,532 --> 01:57:55,199
I can get us in there.

1206
01:58:02,341 --> 01:58:04,275
Get ready.

1207
01:58:04,577 --> 01:58:06,579
What now?

1208
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:09,046
You're not gonna like it.

1209
01:58:28,868 --> 01:58:30,970
There's a net at the bottom.

1210
01:58:30,971 --> 01:58:33,237
Don't think, just jump.

1211
01:58:43,983 --> 01:58:45,685
Are you good?

1212
01:58:45,686 --> 01:58:47,618
Good?

1213
01:58:48,688 --> 01:58:50,988
Let's go.

1214
01:58:56,596 --> 01:58:58,629
Wait here.

1215
01:59:05,471 --> 01:59:06,872
Against the wall.

1216
01:59:06,873 --> 01:59:09,206
Against the wall!

1217
01:59:12,478 --> 01:59:13,946
How are you awake?

1218
01:59:13,947 --> 01:59:16,249
Because I'm smarter than you.

1219
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:17,650
And they need me.

1220
01:59:17,651 --> 01:59:19,685
Where are they controlling it from?

1221
01:59:19,686 --> 01:59:22,355
Why would I tell you that? It's
not like you're gonna shoot me.

1222
01:59:22,356 --> 01:59:24,557
Why do people keep saying that?

1223
01:59:27,761 --> 01:59:30,302
Where are they controlling it from?

1224
01:59:36,636 --> 01:59:39,177
Did you really need to shoot him?

1225
01:59:39,572 --> 01:59:41,874
Every minute we waste,
another Abnegation dies

1226
01:59:41,875 --> 01:59:44,310
and another Dauntless
becomes a murderer.

1227
01:59:44,311 --> 01:59:46,644
Peter, let's go.

1228
02:00:01,861 --> 02:00:03,429
That's it, isn't it?

1229
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:04,764
Yeah.

1230
02:00:04,765 --> 02:00:06,599
I've seen Jeanine go in there.

1231
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:09,300
That's where she's
controlling it from.

1232
02:00:20,746 --> 02:00:24,482
Like you said, there
isn't a second to waste.

1233
02:00:29,488 --> 02:00:32,057
Dad, no!

1234
02:00:32,058 --> 02:00:33,726
Dad...

1235
02:00:33,727 --> 02:00:35,061
Do whatever it takes...

1236
02:00:35,062 --> 02:00:36,929
Hey!

1237
02:01:15,968 --> 02:01:19,270
Watch Caleb. I'm going in there.

1238
02:02:10,956 --> 02:02:13,324
Hey. Hi.

1239
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:29,473
Four...

1240
02:02:30,176 --> 02:02:32,978
Four... Four, it's me.
You're in a sim.

1241
02:02:32,979 --> 02:02:35,446
He can't hear you.

1242
02:02:36,715 --> 02:02:38,684
Amazing, isn't it?

1243
02:02:38,685 --> 02:02:41,187
Everything we think of
that makes up a person,

1244
02:02:41,188 --> 02:02:44,590
thoughts, emotions, history...

1245
02:02:44,591 --> 02:02:46,592
All wiped away by chemistry.

1246
02:02:46,593 --> 02:02:47,693
Four.

1247
02:02:47,694 --> 02:02:49,727
He's gone.

1248
02:02:50,029 --> 02:02:51,864
And we're all safer for it.

1249
02:02:51,865 --> 02:02:54,767
Safer? How are we safer?

1250
02:02:54,768 --> 02:02:56,936
The brilliance of
the faction system

1251
02:02:56,937 --> 02:02:59,171
is that conformity to the
faction removes the threat

1252
02:02:59,172 --> 02:03:02,875
of anyone exercising
their independent will.

1253
02:03:02,876 --> 02:03:05,709
Divergents threaten that system.

1254
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:10,583
Don't get me wrong.

1255
02:03:10,584 --> 02:03:13,652
There's a certain beauty
in your resistance,

1256
02:03:13,653 --> 02:03:16,255
your defiance of categorization.

1257
02:03:16,256 --> 02:03:19,223
But it's a beauty we can't afford.

1258
02:03:31,504 --> 02:03:35,241
Four, it's me. It's me.

1259
02:03:35,242 --> 02:03:37,708
Please, Four, look at me.
Look at me.

1260
02:03:57,930 --> 02:03:59,964
Four! It's me!

1261
02:04:28,727 --> 02:04:30,427
Four, stop!

1262
02:04:30,930 --> 02:04:32,896
Stop!

1263
02:04:33,632 --> 02:04:35,432
Stop...

1264
02:04:36,569 --> 02:04:38,836
Four... Please...

1265
02:04:43,976 --> 02:04:47,745
It's okay, it's okay.
I love you. It's okay.

1266
02:04:51,984 --> 02:04:53,884
It's okay.

1267
02:04:54,186 --> 02:04:56,587
I love you. It's okay.

1268
02:05:02,061 --> 02:05:03,961
Four, look at me. Look at me.

1269
02:05:06,599 --> 02:05:09,134
It's me. It's me.

1270
02:05:09,135 --> 02:05:12,002
It's me. It's me.

1271
02:05:20,713 --> 02:05:22,413
Tris...

1272
02:05:27,086 --> 02:05:28,886
Go.

1273
02:05:31,857 --> 02:05:33,624
Finish it.

1274
02:06:09,428 --> 02:06:11,128
Help!

1275
02:06:14,933 --> 02:06:16,834
Hey!

1276
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:26,979
Shut it down.

1277
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:28,746
No.

1278
02:06:43,128 --> 02:06:44,963
I am not gonna
ask you again. Do it!

1279
02:06:44,964 --> 02:06:46,932
Shut it down!

1280
02:06:46,933 --> 02:06:49,794
I admire you willing to die
for what you believe...

1281
02:06:50,035 --> 02:06:52,002
But so am I.

1282
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:57,107
You can't do it, can you?

1283
02:07:31,410 --> 02:07:34,446
Maybe you're not quite as Dauntless
as you thought you were.

1284
02:07:34,447 --> 02:07:36,880
You're right.

1285
02:07:37,883 --> 02:07:39,752
I'm not.

1286
02:07:39,753 --> 02:07:41,685
I'm Divergent.

1287
02:07:51,330 --> 02:07:54,998
Now shut it down and
wipe the program.

1288
02:08:24,096 --> 02:08:25,798
<i>Simulation abort.</i>

1289
02:08:25,799 --> 02:08:28,340
<i>System-wide shutdown.</i>

1290
02:08:36,141 --> 02:08:38,175
No... No...

1291
02:08:40,512 --> 02:08:42,679
No!

1292
02:08:49,555 --> 02:08:52,224
Don't get me wrong.

1293
02:08:52,225 --> 02:08:54,885
There's a certain beauty
to your resistance.

1294
02:09:02,601 --> 02:09:04,169
Tris...

1295
02:09:04,170 --> 02:09:06,837
<i>Lockdown now in effect.</i>

1296
02:09:07,139 --> 02:09:09,106
All right, let's move!

1297
02:09:10,008 --> 02:09:12,142
We gotta go. Now.

1298
02:09:17,950 --> 02:09:20,083
Tobias.

1299
02:09:21,486 --> 02:09:24,121
We need to keep moving.

1300
02:09:32,331 --> 02:09:34,231
All right, move!

1301
02:09:48,180 --> 02:09:50,213
Son!

1302
02:09:59,892 --> 02:10:01,360
I got it!

1303
02:10:01,361 --> 02:10:03,193
I know you do.

1304
02:10:18,977 --> 02:10:21,397
My mom and dad died today.

1305
02:10:24,516 --> 02:10:26,251
They're gone.

1306
02:10:26,252 --> 02:10:28,020
I know.

1307
02:10:28,021 --> 02:10:30,320
But they loved you, Tris.

1308
02:10:32,157 --> 02:10:34,493
For them, there was no
better way to show you.

1309
02:10:40,565 --> 02:10:42,501
Now we have nothing.

1310
02:10:42,502 --> 02:10:45,102
We have no home, no faction...

1311
02:10:50,309 --> 02:10:52,929
I don't even know who I am anymore.

1312
02:10:58,650 --> 02:11:01,318
I know exactly who you are.

1313
02:11:02,321 --> 02:11:04,354
You sure about that?

1314
02:11:05,524 --> 02:11:08,191
Yeah, I'm very sure.

1315
02:11:11,163 --> 02:11:13,030
Come here.

1316
02:11:25,677 --> 02:11:28,180
<i>We're like the Factionless now.</i>

1317
02:11:28,181 --> 02:11:31,149
<i>We've left everything behind,</i>

1318
02:11:31,150 --> 02:11:34,418
<i>but we found ourselves
and each other.</i>

1319
02:11:36,088 --> 02:11:39,624
<i>Tomorrow we may have
to fight again,</i>

1320
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:43,028
<i>but, for now, we'll ride the
train to the end of the line...</i>

1321
02:11:43,029 --> 02:11:46,263
<i>And then we'll jump.</i>
